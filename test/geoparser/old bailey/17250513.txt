BEFORE the Right Honourable Sir GEORGE MERTTINS , Knt . Lord Mayor of the City of London Mr. Justice Fortescue , Mr. Baron Page , Sir William Thompson , Kt . Recorder , John Raby Sergeant at Law , and several of his Majesty 's Justices of the Peace for the City of London and County of Middlesex . The JURORS were as followeth : The London Jury James Kelham , Eustace Harding , William Vere , William Best , Oliver Bressington , Jonathan Holland , Samuel Puller , Edmund Hickman David Tough , John Hains , John Dawson , John Edwards . The Middlesex Jury . James Dunbar , Thomas Cradock , John Wells , Matthew West , John Purdy , Thomas Ryland , Richard Golding , William Brin , William Brown , Richard Wilder , Thomas Smith , Thomas Wisdich . The Proceedings were as follows , viz . John Plant , of Bishopsgate , was indicted for privately stealing from Ann Brown a Handkerchief value 6 d. and two Guineas , the Goods and Money of William Brown , on the 21st of April last . William Brown thus depos 'd : I having two Guineas to pay for Excise , I ty 'd it up in a Silk Handkerchief , and sent it by my Daughter Ann Brown , a Child about 10 Years old . She soon came back crying , and said she had lost it going through Bishopsgate . I was told by others , that a Man in a Sailor 's Jacket was seen to have such a Handkerchief , and ran down Hounsditch . A Fellow being afterward , seen in such a Jacket , ( which was distinguishable by three odd Buttons ) he was apprehended , and upon Examination it appear 'd that he was the Prisoner 's Brother , and that not himself but the Prisoner had that Jacket on when the Girl lost the Money . By his Directions we found the Prisoner at the House of Eliz Fowler , the Cherry-Tree in Golden-Lane . This is the Handkerchief that I ty 'd the Money in when I gave it to the Girl , and this same Handkerchief I found about the Prisoner 's Neck when he was taken . He confess 'd that he met with it near Bishopsgate , and from thence immediately ran through Devonshire-Square into Still-Alley , and there untying it , he found two Guineas in it . He is a Fellow of an ill Character , and has not been long out of New-Prison . Margaret Kingstow thus depos 'd : As I was cleaning Shoos in the Street near Bishopsgate , about Nine in the Morning , I saw the Prisoner pass by me , turn the Lappet of his Jacket aside , thrust a colour 'd Handkerchief into his Breeches Pocket , and run down Hounsditch ; and presently after I heard the Child Ann Brown crying for the Loss of her Money . Ann Brown deposed , that she lost the Money under Bishopsgate . The Prisoner thus made his Defence : As I was going along Bishopsgate-street , over against the Church , I happen 'd to see this Handkerchief lying upon the Ground ; so I took it up , and holding it in my Hand , Who has lost a Handkerchief ? says I. Whereupon a Gentlewoman that sells Apples cry 'd Halves . But when I open 'd it , and found two Guineas in it , 'T is all your own , young Man , says he , and much good may't do you . If the Gentlewoman was here , she 'd say the same thing herself . As for my being in New-Prison , it was for no Harm , for I never did an ill thing in my Life : 'T was only for Face-making , ( that is ) getting of Bastard Children . Guilty . Death . Philip Large , of S. Dunstan 's in the West , was indicted for privately stealing from Tho Clements a Handkerchief value 18 d. on the 20th of April last . Guilty 10 d. Transportation .

Thomas Hilton thus depos 'd : I lie in my Shop ; I went to Bed about Midnight , and left all fast . About Two , the Watch call 'd me up ; I found the Bill of my Window was wrenched off , one of the Shutters taken down , the Sash thrown up , and the Goods in the Indictment missing . The Prisoners were committed to New-Prison on Suspicion of another Robbery . I went thither to them , and found one of my Hones and my Wig upon Ned Harney . My Glass I found at Henry Yarp 's in Hounsditch , who bought it of Sam Hull . The Prisoners then made their Defence . Hull said that the Glass he sold to Yarp was left him by his Father . Harney said that he bought the Wig in Rag-Fair : And Sperry protested , that he was as innocent as the Stones unborn . The Jury acquitted them . Samuel Hull , Edward Harney , and William Sperry , of S. Leonard Bromley , were a 2d time indicted for assaulting Tho . Golding on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Coat val . 4. s a Pair of Breeches , Stockings , Shoos and Buckles , a Hat , a Rure , a Pruning-Knife , and a Penknife , on the 20th of April last . Golding thus depos 'd : Between 9 and 10 at Night , a little beyond the Watch-House in Bow Road , I pass 'd by a Man which I believe to be Ned Harney : He turn 'd back : I asked him why he did so ? He swore at me , and bid me stand Some Words pass 'd betwixt us , when two more ( which I am pretty positive were Sperry and Hull ) started up with a G - D - ye , What do you strike the Man for ? They drag 'd me into a Field , stript me naked , and then give me an old Wastcoat to put on . I beg 'd hard for my Pocket Book . Tell me where you live , says Hull , and I 'll send : you to-morrow , if I find nothing in it that will be of use to me . I told him I lived next to the Five Bells in Bromley . He was not so good as his Word : But however , my Name being in it , and it being found in Wood-street by a Men who was acquainted with a Neighbour of mine , I got it again . The Prisoners being sent to New-Prison on another Occasion , I went thither , and found my Breeches upon Sperry . I knew them again by the new Strings , a Darn upon the Knee , and 1 Patch betwixt the Legs . The Pruning Knife I found at Sperry 's Lodging . My Penknife he delivered to Sir Isaac Titland , and at the same time said , This Knife I took from Golding in these Breeches . Hull and Harney were acquitted ; but Sperry found guilty . Death . Samuel Hull , Edward Harvey , and William Sperry , alias Spiller , of S. Andrew 's Holborn , were a 3d time indicted for breaking and entring the House of William Colbin , and taking thence three Wigs value 9 l. and 15 Ounces of Human Hair val . 21 l. on the 27th of April last in the Night . William Colbin depos 'd , that his Shop was broke open , and the Goods in the Indictment taken away . Hull 's Confession before Sir Francis Forbes was read , in which he own 'd , that he , with Sperry and Harvey , broke open Colbin 's Shop in Camomile-street , ( but did not say whether in the Night or Day ) and took out the Hair and Wigs , one of which he sold in Middle-Row .

Edward Harvey and William Sperry , of Aldgate , were a 4th time indicted for breaking and entring the House of James Walker , and taking thence six Pair of Stockings val 15 s. on the 28th of April , in the Night-time . James Walker depos 'd , that he lost the Stockings out of his Shop at the Hermitage ; but knew not how , not when . John Johnsy thus depos 'd : Sperry had lodg 'd at my House : His Wife brought me four Pair of Stockings to sell . Where did you get them ? says I . - Your Husband leads a loose Life , and I am afraid they are stolen . I am afraid so too , says she , and I believe he 'll never leave off till he brings me and himself too to the Gallows . But I 'll go and fetch him and his Companion , and let them answer for themselves . She went away , and quickly return 'd , with her Husband and Harvey . They asked Half a Crown a Pair for the Stockings . I examin 'd how they came by 'em ; and Harvey said they were his , and he bought them to go to Sea ; but wanting a little ready Money , he was willing to dispose of them again . But afterwards he confess 'd that he wrenched aside the Shutters of Walker 's Shop , and pull 'd them out with a Hook . They were carry 'd before the Justice : Their Confession was drawn up , and Sperry was going to sign it ; but Harvey pull 'd him away , with a G - D - ye for a Fool ! Are you going to sign your own Dead-Warrant ? They were committed to New-Prison ; but the Keeper there was for having them sent to Newgate ; for he thought they did not belong to his Posterity . The Jury found them guilty of Felony . Rawson Paul , of S. Bride 's , was indicted for stealing Eleven Guineas , and a Piece of Gold , val . 3 l. the Goods of Tho .

Nine Spoons val . 40 s. and a Guinea and a half , the Goods and Money of Oliver Mills , in the House of Oliver Mills , on the 29th of April last . Oliver Mills thus depos 'd : I sell a Pot of Home-brew 'd Ale . The Prisoner was my Servant , and got up early one Morning in order to brew . Now this Plate of mine was in a Box in the Kitchen , which Box he broke open , and took it away bodily . I enquired after him of an old Acquaintance of his , who told me that he heard he was gone to a certain Whore in the Mint . Then I went to the Mint to see for this Whore , and there I understood that she was removed to fresh Quarters in Drury-Lane . The Prisoner was afterwards taken at the Swan in Leadenhall-Street . He confess 'd he had pawn 'd the two Mugs and six Spoons at the White Hart and Anchor in Barbican , where they were found . The Tumbler and the other three Spoon he presented to Madam . Mary Armstrong depos 'd , that she received the Tumbler and three Spoons from the Prisoner .. Guilty val . 39 s. Transportation . Jane Johnson , alias Price , alias Peirce , of Bishopsgate , was indicted for stealing a Petticoat , three Mobs , a Sarsnet-Hood , and a Child 's Frock , the Goods of Jane Benson , on the 4th of May inst . Jane Benson thus deposed : Mary Lee was my Lodger , and the Prisoner having some Acquaintance with her , came to see her now and then ; and so it fell out that she came one Day when I was attending the Child ; and the Child was a little cross vixen Thing , and it had befoul 'd itself lamentationly : So , says the Prisoner to me , Mother Benson , says she , you look as if you was very weary and sleepy : I would have you go and take a Nap , and lay the Child by you , and I will wash its Things the while . And so I went ; but when I waked , and found that this wicked Jade was gone , and my Cloaths were gone too , it put me into a strange Confirmation , for I never respected she would a ' served me so . The next Witness deposed to this Effect : My Name is Mary Lee ; and tho ' I say it , there is never a Woman in the Parish that takes more Care for an Honest Livelihood than myself . I turn my Hand to any Thing to get a Penny : Sometimes I sell Things in Leadenhall Market ; and sometimes I do an odd Char at one House , and sometimes at another . We Market-Women are up early and late , and work hard for what we have . We stand all Weathers , and go thro ' thick and thin . It is well known , that I was never the Woman that spared my Carcass ; and if I spend three Farthings now and then , it is nothing but what is my own . I get it honestly , and I do not care who knows it ; for if it was not for something to cheer the Spirits between whiles , and keep out the Wet and Cold ; alackaday ! it would never do : We should never be able to hold it ; we should never go thro ' stich with it , so as to keep Body and Soul together . But as for this Jenny Johnson the Prisoner , she coming sometimes for a Quartern to the same Shops that I made use of , we now and then had a Dish of Chat together , and so we became pretty well acquainted ; whereof she came to see me two or three Times ; and of all the Times in the World , she happened to come that Day as my Landlady lost her Things . Now after that , she comes to me at a certain Place , and there we had two or three Quarterns of such simple Stuff as we poor Souls are glad to drink . And from thence we went to another Friend 's House , and there truly she would needs treat me with a Quartern of right French Brandy ; whereof I wondred at it , because we had had but a very indifferent Market that Day . Oh ! says she , I do not want for money ; I have got above a Crown in my Pocket ; and so we went to another Friend 's House , and another , and another to that ; and so by way of Discourse about this , and that , and t'other ; and a Talking about my Landlady , and how she lost her Things , and all that ; Why , says Jenny , says she , as for your Landlady 's three Mobs and a Handkerchief , I sold them all for a Shilling . The Jury acquitted her . John Jones , of S. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing in the Warehouse , of William Beatnife , two Spring Sides for a Coach , val . 40 s. the Goods of Wm .

Katharine Green , of S. Andrews Holborn , was indicted for stealing six Pieces of Silk , being Breadths for Petticoats , val . 15. s. the Goods of Persons unknown , on the 10th of April last . Acquitted . Katharine Lewis , of S. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing from John Hutton 10 s. 6 d on the 23d of April last . John Hutton thus deposed : I live in the Meuse : I had been in the Temple to receive a little Money , and afterwards staid there drinking till One or Two in the Morning ; at which time , being pretty well in for it , I came away ; and as I was going along the Strand , I overtook three Soldiers . They jostled me as I pass 'd by them ; but I went forward without saying any Thing to them : And soon after I met the Prisoner . My Dear , says she , will you give me a Pint ? I being willing to shun the Soldiers , who were not far behind me , stept with her into the Crown and Harp Tavern , the Corner of S. Martin's-Lane . I called for a Pint of Wine ; but before we had drunk it , I happened to put my Hand into my Pocket , and miss 'd Half of a Guinea and some Silver . She ran down Stairs a-cross the Way , and I after her : But presently the three Soldiers came up to her Assistance . She cry 'd to them , Kill the Dog , kill him . So they all drew their Bayonets , and forced me up again the Wall . Gentlemen , I hope ( says I ) you will not be so honourable as to kill me . Edward Jones thus deposed : As I was coming by the Bottom of S. Martin's-Lane , ( the Night was very dark ) I heard a Slap o ' the Face given , and somebody say , You have pick 'd my Pocket you Bitch of Half a Guinea . Coming nearer , I discovered three Soldiers , with their Bayonets drawn , and pointed at the Prosecutor , who was forced up to the Wall . I called the Watch , and the Soldiers ran off . But the Woman endeavouring to get away too , ran against a Coach that stood in the Street , and so was taken . The Constable deposed , That when the Prisoner and Prosecutor were brought to the Watch-House , they were both confoundedly drunk . She said , if She had any more about her than 4 s. 6 d. she knew nothing of it ; but in searching her Pocket , I found Half a Guinea and more Silver . The Prisoner thus made her Defence : The Prosecutor took hold of me in the Strand , and would make me go to the Tavern . I was very unwilling ; but he would not let me alone , and so I went . We had three Pints of Wine . He gave me Money to lie with me , but no Gold that I know of . It is possible indeed that Half a Guinea might slip in among the Silver ; but I saw none . And because I refused to comply with what he required , be charged me with picking his Pocket , which I was surprized at . However , he paid his Reckoning , went down before me , and waited at Door ; and as I came out , You Bitch , says he , give me my Half Guinea . I ran away , and two or three Soldiers came up ; but I knew nothing of them , for I never saw them before . The Jury acquitted her . Elizabeth Marlow , alias Murphy , of S. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing 25 Yards of Dunjar , val . 30 s. the Goods of John Kirk , in the Shop of John Kirk , on the 6th of May . Guilty val . 4 s. 10 d.

Walter Longford thus deposed : The Prisoner was a Lodger . I lost the Goods on the Wednesday , and on the Saturday following I distributed printed Advertisements to the Goldsmiths , and Pawnbrokers . The Goods were very remarkable , exactly described , and a Reward of 20 s. offer 'd . I carried one of these Bills myself to White , a Pawnbroker , in Baldwin 's Gardens , who positively denied that he had any such Goods in his House ; but going thither again with a Search-Warrant on the Monday following , he presently confessed that he had the Plate , and deliver 'd it up ; but yet in the Afternoon , he sent his Servant to demand the Reward promis 'd in the Advertisement .

John England , and William Craftow , of Covent-Garden , were indicted , for that they , with Robert Bent , not yet taken , did steal 1 Cock and 5 Hens , val . 6 s. the Goods of Robert Kirkland , on the 4th of March last . John Kirkland deposed , that his Stall ( the Corner of Bow-street in the Covent-Garden ) was broke open , and his Poultry , Oranges , Lemons , and Apples , taken away . William Audry thus deposed : England set me to watch at the End of the Street , and whistle if any body came , while they broke open the old Man 's Apple-Stall ; from whence they brought 6 Fowls , and their Pockets full of Oranges , and other Fruit ; all which we carried to Tottenham-Court . The Prisoner England thus made his Defence : I am a Slater by Trade , and that Rogue Audry was to have been my 'Prentice : but he stealing a Game-Cock and 2 Hens , from Justice Ellis , he carried the Cock to fight for 5 Guineas at the Seven-Dials , where it was own 'd , and he apprehended ; and so , in Hopes of getting off , he has made himself an Evidence , and sworn this against me . Most of his Relations have been Rogues and Whores ; his Aunt is now in New Prison ; he has had 3 Cousins hang 'd at Tyburn , and in a little time he 'll go the same Way himself . The Jury acquitted 'em . Robert Martin , of S. Andrew 's Holborn , was indicted for stealing a Suit of Cloths , val . 30 s. the Goods of William Nicholson , on the 10th of April last . Guilty val . 4 s. 10 d. Transportation . Jane Thornham , of Stepney , was indicted for stealing 4 Caps , val . 6 d. a Pair of Pinners , 12 d. a Pair of Ruffles , 3 d. and a Hood , 6 d. the Goods of William Farrow on the 3d of May . Acquitted . Thomas Nolson , and William Nolson , of Islington , were indicted for assaulting Jonathan Davison on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 16 s. 3 d. the Money of John Davison , and a Brown Mare , val . 20 l. the Goods of John Brown , on the 30th of April last . Jonathan Davison thus deposed : I being a Taylor , and having done some Work for Mr. Brown , he recommended me to a Friend of his at Harrow on the Hill ; to which Place we went together ; Mr. Brown in a Chaise , and I upon his Mare : We return 'd in the Evening ; and I being but an indifferent Horseman , Mr. Brown drove too fast for me . However , I came jogging after as well as I could ; and about Ten o ' Clock came to Holloway , where the two Prisoners pass 'd me ; one of 'em had a sort of a Budget , and look 'd like a Carpenter : They saw that I was tired , and could not very well get my Mare along the Road ; whereupon they turn 'd about , and cry 'd , D - ye , stand and deliver presently , or you 're a dead Man , and so they took 16 s. from me , pulled me off the Mare , and mounted themselves , Tom . first , and Will . behind him . It was a Star-light Night , and I saw 'em pretty plainly , especially Tom . who had a dirty white Wastecoat : They rode towards London , and swore that I was a dead Man if I offer 'd to follow them . I walk 'd along as well as I could in my Boots , and enquired of some Waggoners that I met , if they saw such Men upon such a Mare ? But they told me , No . I called at the Queen's-Head at Holloway , but could hear nothing of 'em ; from thence I made shift to get to Mr. Grimsted 's , at the Angel and Gown in Islington , where I told 'em how I was robbed , and described the Prisoners and the Mare to them ; and not long after , the Boy of the House going to the Door , saw two Men coming along agreeable to my Description , and came and told us . The Prisoners stopt , hung the Mare at the Door , and came in ; I would have had Mr. Grimsted have secured them ; but he was unwilling to do it at that time ; and so being glad that I had found the Mare again , I got upon her , and rode home , without taking any farther Notice of 'em . I am positive that Tom . was one of the Men that robb 'd me , but can not be certain that Will . was the other . William Grimsted thus deposed : Between 10 and 11 , Davison came to my House , told the Company that he was robb 'd , and described the Persons . Whether he was disordered with the Fright , or the Vexation of being robb 'd , or with walking in his Boots from the Place where he lost his Money , which is about a quarter of a Mile from my House , or whether he had been drinking too much , I can not tell ; but certain it is , that not only I , but all that were in my House took him to be fuddled , and that his Mare had only thrown him , and so ran away But in less than a quarter of an Hour after , my Boy comes in and says , Here 's two such Men come to the Door . with such a Mare . We went to the Door , and as soon as we saw 'em , we were of the Boy 's Mind , for they answer 'd the Description that Davison had given of 'em ; one of them in particular was in a white dirty Wastecoat . Davison presently said , These are the Men , and this is the Mare . But then we thought that it was only a Drunken Frolick , because if these Men had taken the Mare from him , they would hardly have stopt at a House so near where the Fact was committed . Davison seeing we gave but little Credit to his Account , he got upon the Mare , and rid homewards , and the Prisoners never offer 'd to prevent him . I then ask 'd 'em where they got the Mare ? They said , they found her astray in White Conduit-Feilds , and were going to carry her to Rolf 's Pound : Upon farther Enquiry , I found that they did not come the direct Road to the Pound , but went round a Byeway , thro ' Mr. Sibban 's ( the Cow-keeper 's ) Ground , which is 4 or 5 times farther about than the right Way . This made me begin to suspect'em ; for I thought this was the Reason that none of the Carriers that Davison met on the Road , had seen these two Men upon the Mare ; and that tho ' he walk 'd in his Boots , yet he came to my House sooner than they that rid it ; and so I sent for a Constable . The Deposition of this Witness was corroborated by Basil Kemp , Jeremy Eustace , and others . Robin Hughs ( the Boy ) thus deposed : As I was shutting up the Windows , I saw the Prisoners coming along , one upon the Mare , and the other walking a foot . It It being the last Day of April , I ask 'd 'em if they were going a Maying already ? And as they came a little nigher , I thought they and the Beast were agreeable to Davison 's Account of 'em ; and so I ask 'd 'em , where they were going with that Mare ? Upon which one 'em said , Let 's go and see if it 's Grimsted 's Mare ; but the other answer 'd , D - ye what need ye mind what he says ? They made a little Stop , and I ran in and call 'd my Master . Mr.Brown thus deposed : Mr. Davison went with me to Harrow ; he was in my Company all Day , and I saw him drink nothing that was likely to disorder him . We were benighted in returning ; and he being but an indifferent Rider , I lost him before we came to Hollaway But he came to my House late that Night , and told me of his being robb 'd , and he was then sober . Thomas Nolson thus made a Defence for himself and his Brother : I and my Brother were in Union Court , opposite to S. Andrew 's Church in Holborn , at half an Hour past Ten . From thence we were going to my Mother 's , who lives at Lower Hollaway ; and by the way , in White-Conduit-Feilds , we saw this Mare saddled , and her Bridle thrown over her Head , and ty 'd to a Stile . I was afraid some Rogues had been robbing thereabouts , and so had left her there ; but , says my Brothers , Do n't be afraid , we 'll take the Mare to Town ; but we wo n't go the Road-way , and then we shall be in no Danger of meeting any body . So my Brother got up , and I walked behind him , till we came thro ' Sibban 's Ground to the Angel and Crown Ale-house . The Boy was at the Door , and ask 'd whose Mare that was ? And we said , we could not tell ; and so he call 'd several People out of the House , and one of 'em said to Davison , Is this your Mare ? And he said it was . Why then , said I , I am very glad of it . Whereupon , one Mr. Kemp being there , D - this Fellow , ( says Mr. Kemp ) he 's got drunk , and pretends that he has been robb 'd , to impose upon People 's Charity , and get some Money by it . John Baily deposed , that he lived in New-street ; that he was a Scabbard-Maker , and dealt in Sword Blades ; that Tom . had been his Apprentice , and afterwards his Journeyman , and behaved well all the Time that he knew him . Elizabeth Foster thus deposed : The Prisoner went from my Mother 's in Union-Court at half an Hour past Ten , on the last Day of April ; and it was then a very bright Moonshine Night . Thomas Green thus deposed : I was standing at my Door , at the Angel and Crown in Union-Court , and a Neighbour 's Girl came to ask me what it was a Clock . I took out my Watch , and it wanted just three Minutes of Ten ; and then I saw Tom . Nolson and Betty Foster come out of her Mother 's ( Mrs. Witby 's ) House . But I was afterwards told that she went to Saffron-Hill with him , and he came back again to see her Home . Elizabeth Witby spoke to the same Effect . Anne Edge , and her Maid Mary Taylor , at the Queen's-Head in Holloway , deposed , that between Nine and Ten , or there-abouts , Davison called at their House , and asked if two Men were lately come in there ? for he said he had been robbed of a Mare and two Guineas . The Court , in summing up the Evidence to the Jury , observed , that it was highly improbable that Davison should tie his Mare to a Stile , and walk in his Boots at that Time of Night , so far as to the Angel and Crown , and there describe two Men , that , according to the Evidence given , it was impossible for him to have seen any where that Day , but near the Place where he said he was robbed ; because it was proved that he had been out of Town ever since the Morning : And then the Prisoners came to that very House in less than a Quarter of an Hour after Davison . And tho ' Davison walked it in his Boots , yet , as the Prisoners came a Bye-Way that was further about , and came but a Foot-Pace neither , ( for one of them walked by the Mare 's Side ) it is no Wonder that Davison got there a little before them . The Jury acquitted them . Robert Sanford , of S. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for assaulting Peter Goutier on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 14 s. on the 15th of March last . He was a 2d Time indicted for assaulting Jacob Deblet on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 6 d. on the 15th of March last . He was a 3d Time indicted ( of S. Pancras ) for assaulting William Tolfield in a Field near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Watch , a Wig , a Coat , Wastecoat , Neckcloth , and 4 s. on the 18th of April last . Peter Goutier thus deposed : Between 7 and 8 at Night , as 1 and Jacob Deblet were coming from Marybone , we were pass 'd by the Prisoner , ( who was in a Soldier 's Coat ) and James Little . They turned back upon us ; and the Prisoner , clapping a Pistol to my Face , demanded my Money , and took 11 s. 6 d. from me . Jacob Deblet deposed , that in the like manner , and at the same time , James Little took 6 d. from him . William Tolfield thus deposed : On the 18th of April , between 8 and 9 at Night , as I and another were coming over the Field betwixt Kentish Town and London , James Little , and the Prisoner , who was in a Soldier 's Coat , stept up to us . My Friend was suspicious of their Design , and ran away . G - D - my Blood , says the Prisoner , I am sorry I did not shoot that Son of a Bitch ; and then clapping a Pistol to my face , he bade me deliver . James Little took my Watch , Money , and Wig ; and the Prisoner stripp 'd me of my Coat , Wastecoat , and Turnover . The Jury found them guilty of all three Indictments . Death . Robert Sanford and James Little , of S. Mary-le-Bone , were indicted for a Trespass , in assaulting William Taylor and Elizabeth his Wife and Elizabeth his Wife , on the Highway , with an Intention to rob them , on the 22d of April last . William Taylor , the Milkman , thus deposed : As I and my Wife , and Elizabeth Atkins my Maid , were going along Marybone Fields , near the Bear-Garden , the Prisoners came up ; Sanford assaulted my Wife , and beat her ; and Little presenting a Pistol to me , demanded my Money ; which I not giving him , he shot as me , by which I received a small Hurt in my Hand . But however , I began to struggle with him ; upon which Sanford left my Wife , and made an Offer to fire at me , but his Pistol would not go of ; which so enraged him , that he broke it with beating me about the Head . By this Usage , I received so many Wounds , that I bled as much as two Horses . In the mean time my Maid ran away , and alarmed the Neighbourhood ; and Sanford perceiving she was gone , he jumpt over a Bank and got off . I still had hold of Little ; but in the Struggle he unbuttoned his Coat and Wastecoat , slipt himself out of them , and ran in his Shirt after Sanford . This is the Coat and Wastecoat that he left in my Hands ; they are both very bloody , for I threw 'em over my Head to keep off the Cold . This was corroborated by his Wife and Maid . Little going Home that Night to his Father , and being without his Coat , some Words passed betwixt them ; and he began to abuse his Father very grosly , for which he was sent to Bridewell ; where , by the Rumour of having lost his Coat , he was quickly found out by the Prosecutor . But in regard that he has given Information of several Robberies , he was not now try 'd for the other Facts in which he was concerned with Sanford . The Jury found them both Guilty .

Sarah Muns thus deposed : On Saturday , Night , between 9 and 10 of the Clock , I was taken into a Boat at Hungerford Stairs , in order to go to Westminster . - I do - do not know - I ca n't say that - that I know - the Waterman , but he carried me upon the Water ; - I do not know where , - against my Consent ; and there he left me floating in the Boat , at I do not know what Time ; but while he staid , he was very - rude - and - a - lay with me - once - whether I would or no . - He had the - the car - nal - use of - my Body - without my Con - sent - by - Force - but not - not against my Will . - I did not comply thro ' any Fear - He forced me to it by great Per - Persuasion , and not by any Threats . - And indeed , I can not say whether he had any Thing to - to - do with me or no . He might , or might not , - but he never meddled with me , - so as to do me any Harm ; for if he had , I should have cry 'd out ; but I made no Noise at all . - As for the Money that he took from me : No , he did not take it from me - against my Will . - I think I gave it him freely . - He was welcome to any Thing that I had about me . - A young Man ( I think his Name is Barnham ) found me floating in the Boat about 5 in the Morning ; and he took me out , and went with me before a Justice ; and I was in a great Surprize , and swore I do n't know what . The Jury acquitted him . Elizabeth Smith , of S. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing from Thomas Bowen 7 Guineas , on the 7th of May . Thomas Bowen thus deposed : About Ten o ' Clock on Monday Night , I was got confounded drunk , and was riding along Drury-Lane , and at the Corner of Russel-street I met the Prisoner and another Woman . How do you do , my Dear ? says she ; Wo n't you give us a Pint ? With all my Heart , says I ; and so we went to the Half-Moon Tavern . I hung my Horse at the Door , went up Stairs with them , and call 'd for a Bottle of Wine We sat down together , the Prisoner on my Right Hand , and the other Woman on the Left . They began to talk about Country Affairs ; I told them I came out of Essex , and they pretended to be well acquainted that way , and grew very familiar with me . The Prisoner thrust her Hand into my Breeches , and the other Woman unbutton 'd my Cloaths ; and then I began to think that I was got into ill Company , and so I got up and felt for my Money , but could not find it . I charged them with it ; but they deny 'd it . However , they gave me good Words ; but I not being satisfy 'd with that , they quickly came to bad ones . But at last , to make me easy , they said they 'd help me to my Money again , if I 'd pay the Reckoning , and give them the odd Guinea . I offer 'd them a Crown , and they agreed to it , upon Condition that I would take my Money again without telling it over ; and so I did , and then went away together to a Gin-Shop in Newtoner's-Lane ; and when we came there , the Prisoner bade me look upon my Money , and see if it was right . So I took it out of my Pocket to tell it , and she dash 'd it all out of my Hand , and then they pick 'd it up betwixt 'em , and swore I should never have any of it again . I made a great Uproar , and sent for a Constables . The other Woman ran away , but I secured the Prisoner ; and upon Search , we found six of the seven Guineas in a Pail in the Yard . The Prisoner thus made her Defence : I accidentally went to light a Candle at the Gin-Shop , and there the Prosecutor was quarrelling with a Woman . The Woman got away , and thereupon he charged me with being concerned with her . The Jury acquitted her . Jonathan Wilde , of S. Andrew 's Holborn , was indicted for privately stealing , in the Shop of Katharine Stetham , 50 Yards of Lace , value 40 l. the Goods of Katharine Stetham , on the 22d of January last . He was a 2d time indicted , for that whereas 50 Yards of Lace , value 40 l. was privately stoln in the Shop of Katharine Stetham , by Persons unknown , on the 22d of January last ; he the said Jonathan Wilde , on the 10th of March last , did feloniously receive of the said Katharine Stetham Ten Guineas , on Account and under Colour of helping the said Katharine Stetham to the said Lace again ; and did not then , nor any time since , discover or apprehend , or cause to be apprehended and brought to Justice , the Persons that committed the said Felony . The Prisoner , in the Morning before his Tryal came on , dispersed about the Court a considerable Numbers of printed Lists of the Felons that he had apprehended , which concluded in these Words ; In regard therefore of the Numbers above Convicted , some that have yet escaped Justice are endeavouring to take away the Life of the said Jonathan Wilde , This extraordinary Proceeding gave Occasion to the King 's Counsel to observe , That such Practices were unwarrantable , and not to be suffer 'd in any Court of Justice : That this was apparently intended to take off the Credit of the King 's Witnesses , and to prepossess and influence the Jury . But as he believed them to be Men of Integrity , he was under no Apprehensions that it would have such an Effect : Nor , on the contrary , could he suppose that they would give any other than a conscientious Verdict , according to Evidence , tho ' the indirect Management of the Prisoner was far from making his Cause appear favourable . That it was impossible that a Man that has carry 'd on a Trade of Felony for so many Years past ; a Man that has bred up and erected a Corporation of Felons ; a Man , whose constant known Practice has been to procure Goods that have been lost in any Part of the Town ; that it was impossible that such a Man should not have it in his Power to detect those Felons : And yet that there was good Reason to believe , that ( to the great Scandal of publick Justice ) he has on the contrary terrify 'd many from Reformation , and prevented them from making such Discoveries as might have been of Public Advantage . That if a strict Enquiry was to be made after the Motives of his apprehending those Criminals named in his List , we should find that they were private Interest , old Grudges , or fresh Quarrels , and not the least Regard to Justice and his Country , & c. The Prisoner pray 'd that the Witnesses against him might be examin 'd apart ; which the Court granted . Henry Kelly thus deposed : In January last I went to see Mrs. Johnston , who then lived at the Prisoner 's House : Her Husband brought me over from Ireland ; upon which Account I wanted to speak with her . I found her at home , and we drank a Quartern of Holland 's Gin together . By and by in comes Mrs. Murphy with a Pair of Brocaded Shoos and Clogs , and makes a Present of them to Mrs. Wilde . The Prisoner was in Company . We drank two or three Quarterns more , and then I and Mrs. Murphy got up to go away together . The Prisoner ask 'd me which way I was going ? I told him to my Lodgings at the Seven Dials . I suppose you go Holborn Way , says he . We answer 'd , Yes . Why then , says he , I 'll tell ye what ; - There 's an old Blind Bitch that sells fine Flanders Lace just by Holborn-Bridge ; her Daughter is as blind as herself ; and if ye call there , you may speak with a Box of Lace , ( that is , steal a Box ) - I 'll go along with ye , and shew ye the Door . So the Prisoner and I and Murphy went together , till we came within Sight of the Door : He pointed and shew 'd us which it was , and said he would wait for us , and bring us off , if any Disturbance should happen . Murphy and I went to , and turn 'd over a great deal of Lace , but could see none that would please us , not a Piece that was broad enough , and fine enough , for it was our Business to be very nice and difficult . At last , the old Woman stept up Stairs to fetch another Piece : And as People of our Profession are seldom guilty of losing an Opportunity , I made use of this . I took a Tin Box of Lace , gave it to Mrs. Murphy , and she hid it under her Cloak . The old Woman came down with another Box , and shew 'd us several Pieces , for which she asked 6 s. a Yard . We offer 'd her 4 s. and not being likely to agree about the Price , we came way , and found the Prisoner waiting where we left him . We told him what Success we had had , and so went back with him to his House . There we open 'd the Box , and found Eleven Pieces in it . He ask 'd us if we would have ready Money , or stay till an Advertisement came out . Stock being pretty low with us at that time , we chose the first , and so he gave us three Guineas and four Broad Pieces . I took for my Share three Guineas and a Crown , and Mrs. Murphy had the rest . I ca n't afford to give you any more , ( says he ) ; for tho ' I have got some Influence over her , by helping her to Goods two or three times before , yet I know her to be a stingey hard-mouth 'd old Bitch , and I sha n't get above Ten Guineas out of her . Margaret Murphy deposed the same ; and Katharine Stetham Corroborated that Part of their Depositions which related to their being in her Shop , and added , that she miss 'd the Lace in about half an Hour after they were gone . The Evidence was full and positive against the Prisoner . But here his Counsel ( who waited in readiness if any Point of Law should arise ) stood up , and beg 'd Leave to declare it as their Opinion , that the Defendant , according to the Evidence given against him , could not be guilty of the Indictment ; and their Reason for it was , that the Indictment sets forth , That HE did privately steal this Lace [ IN ] the Shop ; when it was certain that he did not enter the Shop : That he might indeed be guilty of a simple Felony , in being Accessary before the Fact , or in Receiving the Goods after ; but could not be guilty of the Capital Offence , except ( according to the Act ) it had been inserted in the Indictment , that He did Assist , Here or Command . The Court , in summing up the Evidence , observed to the Jury , that in Felonies , Burglaries , and Robberies on the Highway , every Accessary before the Fact is a Principal ; he that stands by , or watches at a Distance , being as guilty , and as liable to the same Punishment , as the very Man that enters the House , or steals the Money or Goods . But as it was not remembered that there had yet been any Precedent , of the like Construction being put upon Indictments of this Nature , it remained as a Matter of Doubt ; and therefore , in such Cases , it was most eligible to incline to the Side of Mercy . The 2d Indictment against Jonathan Wilde was upon the following Clause in an Act passed in the 4th Year of the Reign of his present Majesty ; which was read in Court , viz. `` And whereas there are several Persons who have secret `` Acquaintance with Felons , and who makes it their Business `` to help Persons to their stoln Goods , and by that means `` gain Money from them , which is divided between them and `` the Felons , whereby they greatly encourage such Offenders : `` Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid , That `` where ever any Person taken Money or Reward , directly `` or indirectly , under Pretence or upon Account of helping `` any Person or Persons to any stoln Goods or Chattels , `` every such Person so taking Money or Reward as aforesaid , `` ( unless such Person do apprehend , or cause to be apprehended , `` such Felon who stole the same , and cause such `` Felon to be brought to his Tryal for the same , and give `` Evidence against him ) shall be guilty of Felony , and suffer `` the Pains and Penalties of Felony , according to the `` Nature of the Felony committed in stealing such Goods , `` and in such and the same Manner as if such Offender had `` himself stole such Goods and Chattels , in the Manner and `` with such Circumstances as the same were stoln . '' Katharine Stetham thus deposed : On the 22d of January , between Three and Four in the Afternoon , a Man and Woman came into my Shop , under a Pretence of buying some Lace : They were so very difficult , that I had none below that would please them ; and so , leaving my Daughter in the Shop , I slept up Stairs , and brought down another Box . We could not agree about the Price , and so they went away together ; and in about half an Hour after I miss 'd a Tin Box of Lace , that I valu 'd at 50 l. The same Night , and the next , I went to Jonathan Wilde 's House ; but not meeting with him , I advertised the Lace that I had lost , with a Reward of 15 Guineas , and no Questions ask 'd . But hearing nothing of it , I went to Jonathan 's House again , and then met with him : He desired me to give him a Description of the Persons that I suspected , which I did as near as I could ; and then he told me that he 'd make Enquiry , and bade me call again in two or three days . I did so ; and then he said , that he had heard something of my Lace , and expected to know more of the Matter in a little time . I came to him again on that day that he was apprehended , ( I think 't was the 15th of February . ) I told him , that tho ' I had advertised but 15 Guineas Reward yet I 'd give 20 or 25 rathe than not have my Goods . Do n't be in such a Hurry , says her I do n't know but I may help you to it for less ; and if I can , I will . The Persons that have it , are gone out of Town , I shall set them to quarrelling about it , and then I shall get it : the cheaper . On the 10th of March , he sent me word , that if I would come to him in Newgate , and bring 10 Guineas in my Pocket , he could help me to my Lace . I went : He desired me to call a Porter ; but I not knowing where to find one , he sent a Person who brought one that appeared to be a Ticket-Porter . The Prisoner gave me a Letter , which he said was sent him as a Direction where to go for the Lace ; but I could not read , and so I deliver 'd it to the Porter . Then he desired me to give the Porter Ten Guineas , or else ( he said ) the Persons that had the Lace would not deliver it . I gave the Porter the Money ; he went away , and in a little time return 'd , and brought me a Box that was seal 'd up , but not the same that was lost . I open 'd it , and found all my Lace but one Piece . Now , Mr. Wilde , ( says I ) what must you have for your Trouble ? Not a Farthing , says he , not a Farthing for me . I do n't do these things for Worldly Interest , but only for the Good of poor People that have met with Misfortunes . As for the Piece of Lace that is missing , I hope to get it for you e'er be long ; and I do n't know but that I may help you not only to your Money again , but to the Thief too ; and if I can , much good may't do you . And as you 're a good Woman and a Widow , and a Christian , I desire nothing of you but your Prayers , and for them I shall be thankful . I have a great many Enemies , and God knows what may be the Consequence of this Imprisonment . The Prisoner said nothing in his Defence , but that he had Convicted a great Number of Criminals ; only he desired that Murphy and Kelly might be called in again , which was granted . Then ( this Indictment being laid for helping Kat . Stretham to Goods that had been stole from her by Persons UNKNOWN ) he pray 'd , that Murphy might be ask 'd who stole the Lace ? In expectation , that she would unwarily swear , that herself and Kelly were the Persons ; ( for tho ' such Evidence was given in the former Tryal , the Law could take no Notice of it in this , except it had been sworn over again . ) But the Court inform 'd him , that as Murphy was an Evidence upon Oath , nobody could require her to answer any Questions to accuse herself . Then he pray 'd the Court would ask her , if he ( the Prisoner ) stole the Lace ? To which she answer 'd , No ; but he was concern 'd with those that did steal it , and he received it after it was stolen . From hence the Counsel for the Prisoner beg 'd Leave to observe , That as Murphy had sworn that the Prisoner was guilty of Felony , they presum 'd that the Act upon which he was now indicted , was never intended to affect him , or any other Felon , but only such Persons that were not Felons themselves , but hold a Correspondence with Felons . For as there were old Laws in Force for the Punishment of Felons , it would have been altogether unnecessary that a new Law should be made to the same Purpose , - that is , to no Purpose at all - That the very Preamble to that Clause of the Act upon which the Prisoner is indicted , intimates , by a plain Distinction , that Felons are not in that Place intended . The Words are thus : `` Whereas `` there are several Persons who have secret Acquaintance `` with Felons and who make it their Business to `` help Persons to their Stoln Goods , and by that means `` gain Money from them , which is divided between THEM `` and the FELONS . '' - That by a Proviso in the said Clause , it could not be supposed that felons were there intended , without making Contradictions and Inconsistencies in the Act itself . For the Words are , `` Unless such Person doth apprehend , `` or cause to be apprehended , such Felon who stole `` the same , and cause such Felon to be brought to a Tryal `` for the same , and give Evidence against him . '' Suppose now that there was but one Person concern 'd in such a Case ; can it be thought that ever the Legislature intended that this Person should apprehend himself , bring himself to Tryal , give Evidence against himself , convict himself , and hang himself ? No , certainly . To this the Counsel for the Crown reply 'd to the following Effect , That it was no Absurdity or Contradiction to say , that that Act was intended to affect Felons , even in a Case where there was but one Felon concern 'd : For that a Man 's being a Felon , did not any way hinder him from discovering his Accomplices , if he had any ; and if he had none , but committed the Offence by himself , it would be impossible to try him for taking Money upon Account of restoring Goods that were stolen , till he was first convicted of stealing those Goods : And this first Conviction would then be sufficient . There would be no Necessity for trying him for the other Offence , for if > he was found guilty , it would make no Alteration in his Punishment : But that this was not the Case of the Prisosoner : That it was evident that he had Accomplices , and had not discover 'd them . The Court farther observ 'd , that Felons were so far from being excepted in that Act , that it was principally intended against them ; for it particularly mentions , `` Those that make it their Business to help People to `` stolen Goods . '' And it was certain , that such Persons must be Receivers of stolen Goods , knowing them to be stolen , and such are Felons . That the Case of the Prisoner came within almost every Circumstance of the Act ; it being evident that he was a Person that had secret Acquaintance with Felons , who made it his Business to help People to stolen Goods , and by that means gain 'd Money from them ; which was divided betwixt him and the Felons , and thereby greatly encouraged such Offenders , and had not apprehended them . That it was a very surprizing Plea for a Man to say , I am more guilty than you are aware of , and therefore I ought to suffer less . And that it could not be thought that the Parliament ever intended by this Act to excuse a Man meerly because he was a Felon , and more Criminal than another . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner of the first Indictment , and found him guilty of the other . Death . Robert Harpham , and Thomas Broom , of S. George 's in Hanover-Square , were indicted for High-Treason , in Counterfieting the Current Coin of this Kingdom , on the 16th of April last . Broom being committed but the Night before his Arraignment , he pray 'd that his Tryal might be deferred till next Sessions ; which the Court granted . William Fordham thus deposed . I have known the Prisoner about six or seven Years ; he brought a Sett of Coining Implements into my Cellar , in S. Paul 's Church-yard ; there was an Iron Press , two Dyes for Guineas , two for Half-Guineas , and others for Moidores , and Pieces that went for six or eight Stivers ; a Cutting Tool for making the Blanks , and an Edging Tool for grinding the Edges of the Money . I believe these that are now in the Court are the same ; especially the Cutting Tool , and the Fly of the Press , for he had them of me . He did not lodge in my House , but used to come and work there now and then ; and sometimes I assisted him in coining about twenty Pieces that were counterfeit Guineas , and Half-Guineas , and some Moidores , and other Foreign Peices . He paid me no Rent for my Cellar ; but allow 'd me Part of this Counterfeit Money , in Proportion to the Quantity that he made . From S. Paul 's Church-yard , by the Prisoner 's Directions , I removed these Implements into Rosemary-Lane , and afterwards to Mr. Williams 's in Benjamin-Street , near Swallow-Street ; and from thence to Mr. Bails 's in Wild-Street , where I left 'em , and went to Sea , which is now about two Years ago . Mr. Hornby thus deposed . I have known the Prisoner eight or nine Years . I being Clerk of the Works at the Admiralty , and he being then a Carpenter , and trading in Timber , we had some Dealings together ; but our Correspondence breaking off , I do n't know that I saw him for six Years together , till about a Year and a half ago . In October last , a Statute of Bankrupt was issued against him , and I was chosen Assignee . Upon which Occasion , he had several times invited me to dine with him , at Mrs. Milliscent Russell 's in Paradise-Row , by Hanover-Square ; so in January last , I went thither ; I think we had a Turkey for Dinner ; but it not being ready , he told me , if I 'd go into the Cellar with him , he 'd let me see something that I had never seen in my Life . I went down with him , and he shew 'd me his Press : In this Press , said he , I can make Buttons ; but I 'll shew you a greater Rarity ; and with that he took up a Piece of gilt Metal , put it into the Press , and struck it , and it came out like a Half-Guinea , except the Milling on the Edge ; and that he presently did , by running it thro ' his Edging Tool . I believe that this is the same Press , and that the same Edging Tool . Milliscent Russel thus deposed : When I first knew the Prisoner , he lived with Mr. Fordham in Benjamin-street ; from whence , in about four Months , he removed his Lodgings to my House in College-street ; from thence into King-street in Golden-Square ; and from King-Street to a Plumber 's in Jermyn-street , where he lodged when he was taken up . He desired me to let him have the Use of my Cellar in Paradise-Row . I told him it was damp , and was but of little Service to me , and therefore he should be welcome to it without paying any Rent . He brought thither in the Evening several things in Baskets , two great Pieces of Iron , a Block , and other Things , that I had seen him once work with at Mr. Fordham 's ; and they told me then that they were making of buttons ; but I saw some Pieces taken out like Money . He put up a Grate in my Cellar . I have sometimes heard Knocking , but I never saw him work there ; for he always kept the Keys himself , and would suffer no body to go down . He used to have Sea-Coal and Charcoal brought once in two or three Weeks ; but it was always laid down at the Cellar-Window , and he shovel 'd it in himself . He sent me ( I believe nine or ten times ) to Mr. Yarndner 's a Founder , with a sort of blackish Metal to be flatted , to the Thickness of some of the Notches in this Gage Iron ; and sometimes I fetch 'd the Pieces back again after they were flatted . These Parcels are very much like them : I believe some of them will fit this Notch ; that 's the Thickness of a Guinea . Yes , they fit it exactly . Then here is another Notch of the Thickness of a Half Guinea ; another for Half Crowns , and another for - I do n't know what ; perhaps for Moidores , or some other Outlandish Money . The last Parcel I carried to be flatted , was a little before last Chistmas ; but I never carried out any from the Prisoner after it was flatted . Once or twice , I think , I carried some Gold to be flatted . Yardner deposed , that Milliscent Russel and Thomas Broom , had often , within these four Years past , brought him Parcels of Metals to be flatted , 20 or 30 lb Weight at a time , which seemed to be a Mixture of Brass , Copper , and other Metals ; and that latterly they had brought some Silver . Mr. Oakly deposed , that about three Years ago he had several times cast a Mixture of Copper , brass , and other Metals for the Prisoner , 20 or 30 lb together . The preceding Depositions were confirmed by Quinny , ( who served the Prisoner with Charcoal ) Pierce and Brown , two Smiths ; the former mended the Fly of the Press for Fordham ; and the other made , for the Prisoner , the Iron Clamp or Collar for the Block , to keep it from splitting , which was produced in Court . Broom the Bricklayer thus deposed : I set up such a Grate as this for the Prisoner in Mrs. Russel 's Cellar : I believe it to be the same , by as having so many Bars at the Bottom , which is not usual , for it makes it draw prodigiously . I told him , that such a Grate , in the Manner that I fixt it , would burn the Devil and all of Fuel . So I would have it , says he ; it must serve me either to roast or boil , bake or stew . Mr. Chandler the Messenger deposed , That on the 16th of April , in Mrs. Russell 's Cellar , he seized all these Coining Instruments produced in Court , and had had them ever since in his own Custody . Mr. Pinkny , Deputy Warden , thus deposed : This Press , Cutting Tool , Edging Tool , and these Dyes , which we found in Mrs. Russell 's Cellar , can serve for no other Use than Coining . I likewise found there , these 21 false Half Guineas ; They are strongly gilt , three of them weigh 'd something more than a Guinea . The [ O ] in [ GEORGIUS ] leans a little towards the [ E ] , and is something less than the other Letters , which is exactly the same in this Dye , which was found in the same Cellar . These Dyes appear to have been lately made use of , for here is some of the Gilding now sticking in them . The Prisoner called two or three Witnesses in his Defence . - Knight , a Chair-Maker , thus deposed : I was drinking with the Prisoner in New Bond street , when Hornby came to us in a great Hurry , and desired the Prisoner to get an Iron Clamp for him , and leave it at Mrs. Russell 's . Thomas Butler thus deposed : By Mr. Hornby 's Directions , I made the Grate that stands there , and delivered it at Hornby 's House in Ax-Yard , Westminster . I never made but one such before , and that was for a Jeweller . I have indeed seen others of the same Nature , that have been made for Silver Smiths , and other Trades that have Occasion for fierce Fires to melt Metal . Some others gave Evidence , that they had often received Money of the Prisoner , but never found that he gave them any that was bad . Guilty . Death . Isaac Tesling , and Joseph Nabour , of S. Martin 's in the Fields , were indicted for privately stealing 33 Guineas from Samuel Watts , on the 15th of October last . Acquitted .

Thomas Newsted , and Mary his Wife , and Mary his Wife , of S. Margaret 's Westminster , were indicted for stealing 20 lb of Feathers and a Petticoat , the Goods of Elizabeth North . Acquitted . John Cooper , commonly called Blind Cooper , was indicted for a Misdemeanor in putting off several Counterfeit Guineas , & c. knowing the same to be Counterfeit . It appeared , that on the 15th of March , the Prisoner and Harpham were drinking together at the Rummer Tavern , Charing-Cross . Harpham went away , and the Prisoner gave the Drawer a Guinea to change . He carried it down to his Mistress at the Bar . She scrupled it for being so thick . Mr. Thomson , Warden of the Mint , happened to be behind the Bar at the same time , and desired to see it . He caused it is be cut , and it proved Counterfeit . Harpham and the Prisoner afterwards coming to the same House were apprehended Mr. Reynolds thus deposed . I paid the Prisoner twenty two Guineas on Account of Mr. Hornby . The Prisoner being blind , or pretending to be so , he fumbled over the Guineas a pretty while out of one Hand into t'other , and then began to ring 'em ; and one of 'em not sounding well , he desired me to give him another for it , which I did ; but when I look 'd upon it , I told him I was sure that he never had that Guinea from me , for all that I gave him were old Guineas , but this was a new shining one ; but I thinking it might be good , I made no more Words of it , but paid it away in the Afternoon ; but the next Day it was return 'd me . I told him of it , and he readily gave me two good Half-Guineas for it . Elizabeth Russel thus deposed . I desired the Prisoner to give me Silver for a Guinea ; which he did , after Mrs. Reves , his House-keeper , had look 'd upon it , and told him it was good . But next Day she brought me a Guinea , and said she believed it was not good , and desired me to get it chang 'd . But this was a King George 's Guinea , and the Guinea that I gave him the Day before was King Charle 's Guinea . But I did not know what to do in the Case . I went to change it at Mr. Cotton 's , and he took me before Justice Ward , in whose Hands the Prisoner 's Guinea was left . Mr. Russel thus deposed : I was telling the Prisoner , that the Guinea that he had given my Wife , was left in the Justice 's Hand . The Justice has no Business with it , says he , Go and fetch it from him , and I 'll give you eight Groats for it , for the Gold upon it is worth so much . The Guinea was produced in Court , and compared with the other that was cut . They appeared perfectly alike , and particularly the Figure [ 3 ] in the Date 1723 , was remarkable by a small Blemish occasioned by a Fault in the Dye . One of Harpham 's Dyes was again produced , with which they exactly agreed in that , and all other Parts . Guilty . Fined 100. l and 12 Months Imprisonment .
