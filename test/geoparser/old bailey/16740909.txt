News from the Sessions , OR , A True Relation of all the PROCEEDINGS AT THE Sessions in the Old bayly , Sep. 9th 1674 . Where there were Twenty One persons Cast . With the Number and Particular Crimes of the Persons to be Executed , and all other things there Transacted . And Especially the Tryal & Behaviour of Iohn Randal That lately Kill 'd the Woman in Houlbourn . Printed for Phillip Brecksby , 1674 . THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE Sessions , & c Newgate hath not for a long time been more thronged , nor a greater Goal-delivery been known , then at the Last Sessions : though for the most part the Crimes were so foul , and the proofs so pregnant , that the whole business was dispatcht in three days time . Amongst the Criminals , John Randal may be reckoned one of the most Notorious , who was charged with two Indictments , one for Fellony for stealing several pieces of Plate , and other Goods belonging to Esq ; Blacke , and the other for Murder , Killing his House-Keeper . The Case appeared briefly upon Evidence thus ; This Randal having been formerly Butler to the Squire , took his opportunity when he and all the rest of his family were out of Town , to visit this woman , and there in the Evening Murthered her , and rifled the House , carrying several pieces of Plate away to his Lodging in White-Cross-Street . And coming two days after to a Rag-Shop , being next Door , he was taken upon Suspicion , and upon search of his Lodging , the Plate was found in his trunck , whereupon he Confessed that he Knockt the woman Down with his fist , and that he committed the Robbery , & c. Yet now at the Bar he Pleaded , Not Guilty , to both Indictments . But upon Reading his aforesaid Confession , at his Examination before the Justice ah Commited him , and the Evidence that he was the last seen go into the House that Night the Murther was Commited , and proof of the taking the stoln Plate in his Trunk as aforesaid , he was Convicted and Sentenced to Dye . The next may be rankt Two others , though of a different Sex , yet Guilty of the like Horrid sin of Murther , and that upon their own Children , whose crimes being so nearly resembling each other we may place them together in this Narrative ; For being both Young Wenches , they were it seems inticed to Folly , and at last got with Child , and to cover one sin with a greater , most Unnaturally , and Barbarously , Murthered their Infants , one of them casting hers into an House of Office , and the other endeavouring to Bury hers in a Celler : but being both discovered by certain Symtomes usually visible in that condition , upon strait search , the whole matter came to be disclosed , and they respectively Commited . They had little to say for themselves besides the common Plea , that their Children were Still-born , but upon Reading the Statute whereby it is provided in such Cases that unless the same be proved by , at least one Credible witness , it shall be reputed and punished as Murder , and they were both Condemned to Dye . After them we may reckon another who was proved guilty of killing a Brewers Servant in White-cross-street , but the same being found to be only Manslaughter , and not done with any repeise malice ( as Lawyers speak ) upon his earnest begging the favour of his Book , he was admitted to the benefit of his Clergy ; but after all was not capable to read , and so received sentence of Death . But a remarkable instance of incorrigible wickedness , appeared in another , who but the very last Sessions was burnt in the hand , and yet took thereby so little warning that he was now in again , and found guilty of a Fellony and Burglary . For which crime three other Men were likewise arraigned and condemned , having had the Brand already . And a Woman who formerly had been ( an old offender in such cases ) with another her Companion were convicted also of a Burglary , but only the former condemned to Dye , the last pleading her belly , and by a Jury of Matrons was returned to be with child . But there was none to be preferred to him , who for want of witness proved himself guilty of a Robbery near High-gate upon a Country Higler , who being coming to Market to London with some Poultry one morning very early was set upon by four of the Foot-padd , who took away some of his Poultrey , for money he had none , or very little about him , but Company coming by they were forced to run away , and thereupon the Person rob 'd , and others after some time pursuing after them , they at last took one of them , which was the Prisoner now at the Bar , who being arraigned for the same , resolutely denied that he was any of them , or knew any thing of or concerning the Fact charged against him ; and persisted therein for a long time with so much seeming earnestness and obstinacy , that the prosecutor began to suspect his Eyes , and think that he might be mistaken in the person , till at last the Prisoner desired that since the witness had declared he was robbed by four persons , whereof two came before his Horse , and two behind him , he would declare in which rank he then was , whither before or behind , To which he answering that he was behind : The Criminal suddenly and more loudly than wisely , cry 'd out . My Lord ! this is a perjur 'd Villain , and you ought not to believe a Word he sayes , for by - I was at that time one of the 2 that came up before him , whereby he confest himself concerned , and was accordingly found Guilty . In brief there was in all 21 convicted of Fellony , or cast , but several got off , some by being burnt in the hand , and some by Transportation , amongst which there were two Boys that were Brothers both by nature and in wickedness , one not above eleven years old , but able in depth of all kind of Roguery , to supply the want of years . There was eight in all burnt in the Hand , six ordered for Transportation , three sentenced to be whipt , and one to the Pillory for a Cheat . But for the particularities of Petty Larcetines and smaller Rogueries , it would be too tedious here to relate them . Let us rather conclude with hearty wishes that all would take warning by these unhappy presidents to avoid the like evil Courses , seeing the miseries they thereby bring upon themselves . These crooked paths of impiety , though at first entrance they may seem strewed with Roses , and with delight , leading infallibly in the end to ruine and destruction .
