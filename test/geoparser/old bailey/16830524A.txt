Giving an Account of the several Tryals , viz . for Murders , Felonies , & c with Condemnation of those Convicted . Printed by Authority . Mary Philips ( being one that Buys and Sells Old Cloaths in Thamesstreet ) was Indicted for being accessory with Anne Parkinson to the stealing a black Suit , a Campagne Coat , and Several other Goods from one Mr. Wood , which said Parkinson being fled , is Outlawed for the same . The principal thing which aggravated the matter against Philips was , that she did not keep them in her Shop where she pretended to Buy them , but had hidden them up two pair of Stairs , under a very great parcel of Old Rags . But many Witnesses speaking to her good Reputation , and to the Buying them in her Shop , she was therefore Acquitted . Isabel Barker , Indicted for Keeping a Common Bawdy-house in Moor-Lane , not far from Moor-fields ; but there being no proof thereof , more than that a Married Man lay for some time at her House with a Strumpet as Lodgers , and affirming they were Man and Wife , she was therefore brought in not Guilty . John Butler , Indicted for Stealing a white Caster , a Sword and Belt , & c the Witnesses proved that he coming into a Publick House with other Company to Drink , and being shewed into an upper Room , he left his Company , and went into a back Chamber , from whence he took the said Goods . He in his defence said , the Closet or Back-chamber door being open , and he full of Drink , did go in and take out the Sword , which one of his Consorts afterwards got from him , but denied the rest , this Confession of his making it so evident , he was found Guilty of Felony . Christopher Gage , a kind of Beggar-man , under pretence of Begging , went into a Shop , and put up some Half-hundred weights ( or one at least ) into a Bag , which being noted by a Milk-woman he fled , but when taken confessed he had at times Sold four such Weights to a Pewterer , all which were lost from the same place , and the Pewterer since restored Three of them to the Owner , he was therefore found Guilty . Sarah Stephens , Indicted for Picking the Pocket of Nathaniel Berry of Eighteeen pence , upon the Trial it appeared Berry had Pick 'd her up somewhere in Fleetstreet , and carrying her to Drink , she Pick 'd his Pocket of the said Money ( being all he had ) But the said Sarah Stephens in her defence , so confidently denied any knowledge she had of him , or ever to have seen or drank with him ; that at length Berry would not swear positively she was the Woman , wherefore she was acquitted . The Middlesex Jury being then Sworn , these Prisoners following were by them Tried , viz . Henry Castleford , and Thomas Williamson , Indicted for stealing the Coat of a Person unknown , to the value of 5s . The Prosecutor lived some where in St. Giles in the Fields , to whose Shop Castleford came to Sell the said Coat , Williamson in Company with him . This Shopkeeper suspecting them to be men of an ill Life , caused them to be Seized , and at length Committed ; a Bunch of about 12 or more Pick-ock Keys being found in Castlefords Pocket , in excuse of which he then declared he made and sold them . But upon his Tryal he denied it , and said he found them , also that he bought the Coat of a Woman in the street , who Cried Gold and Silver Lace , that he did wear it upon his Back , and had it on when he came to the Shop , which he would not have done if stoln : In conclusion they were both acquitted . Susan Morgan , Indicted for Stealing an Alamode Hood , a Gold Ring , three Holland Aprons , three Cambrick Handkerchiefs , some Laced Sleeves and other Linnen , it appeared she was a Servant Maid to Charles Butler , whose Wife dying when he lay sick , at that opportunity she conveyed away such goods ; she was found Guilty to the value of 10d . John Edgerly , Indicted for the Murder of William Stephenson at Shadwell , by Shooting off a Pistol at him Charged with Powder , and one Leaden Bullet , which piercing the right part of his Head , he thereof languished , and the next Morning died . But upon the Trial it appeared that the Deceased Stephenson had taken the Pistol from Edgerly to look upon it ; that he attempted to Shoot it off , but it not Firing , as he was returning it again to Edgerly , without the Musle end to himself , it accidentally went off and Kill 'd him , without the Trricker being pull 'd by Edgerly , but as the Cock had been left by Stephenson ; therefore it was found Per Infortuniam . James Wilson , Indicted for stealing a Livery-Cloak from the Coach Box of a Gentleman that has a Country-house in Hampstead , which he he confest : But the Evidence against him , valuing the Cloak but at 10d . the Jury accordingly found him Guilty to the value of 10d . Peter Anderson , Indicted for a Robbery upon the High-way , committed upon Samuel Newton , and Samuel Blackbourne , from whom were taken their Campaigne Coats , Swords , Gold Rings and Moneys , numbred in all to a considerable value . Newton and Blackbourne gave evidence , that they being coming from Colchester were on this side Bow , near where the Man Hangs in Chains set upon by Four Foot-Padds , who pulling them off their Horses , drew them over a Gate to a Dunghil out of the Road , where they Rifled them . Newton Swore he believed Anderson to be one of the Four , but that two only were upon him , and Two upon Blackbourne , of which Two Blackbourne Swore positively that Anderson was one ; that he threatned to Shoot him if he spoke a word , and that whereas Blackbourne spoke thick , Anderson Swore he had gotten a Diamond Ring in his Mouth , for which he felt with his Fingers , and threatened to kill Blackbourn if he Bit him : The Evidence therefore being plain against Anderson , he was thereof found Guilty . Mr. William Tyndal , Indicted for the Murder of Thomas Milward Gent . Upon the Trial it appeared to be thus , viz . Milward Being a Life-Guard-man , upon some controversy in Law against one Taunt , whose cause Tyndal seemed to Espouse , had conceived a Grudge against him , and to revenge the same , Way-laid him several days , ( Mr. Tyndal Living at or near the Mews-Yard . ) The most material Witness for the King was a Drawer , who said he saw Mr. Milward waiting in the Gate-way going to the Mews , and that Tyndal coming by , Milward struck him several Blows with a Cudgel , then throwing it away , drew upon him , Swearing Dam you Dog draw ( or such like words . ) That Tyndal stooping , got up the Stick Milward threw away , and with that defended himself until Milward Cut him in several places , and beat the Stick out of his hand , when forced for defence of himself , he stept Two or Three Paces back and drew , that Milward pursued him with great violence , and thereupon Tyndal gave him the Wound of which he died . And whereas at that time Tyndal was in Black Cloaths , and Milward in light Gray . Two other Witnesses did Swear that assoon as the Black Man came up by the Mews Gate , the White Man took up a Cudgel which stood by him , and violently struck the Black Man several Blows , then threw the Stick away , and drew upon him in manner according to the Drawers Evidence , and that when at last the Black Man drew , the White Man run upon the very Sword , and that by his violent forcing upon the Black Man , his Death was rather occasioned , than by any intent in the other to kill him . Other Witnesses were that saw Milward set that Cudgel behind the Gate , and walk about to wait for Tyndals coming by . Witnesses For Tyndal were many , amongst which Mr. Howel a very material one , saying that Milward came the Saturday before to Tyndals House , and knocking at the Door , Tyndal came down , and they walked together awhile , but at parting Milward dispitefully took hold of Tyndal , saying God Dam you Rascal , you know this is not a place , come out into the Mews , and I'le be revenged on you . To which Tyndal replied , what you have to say to me I'le answer at the Law , but if you come hither to Assassinate me , I'le complain to your Officers . Much other Evidence came in , which made it apparent Tyndal had used all means possible to avoid Fighting , and when set upon , was forced thereto for safeguard of his own Life . James Dockray , and Sarah Carter , were Indicted for Stealing a Sheet to the value of 5s . from Elizabeth Shipton Widdow , into whose House they came to Drink ; the Widdow and her Daughter did Swear the Sheet to be upon their Bed before the said two Persons came , and that they miss 'd it assoon as they were gone , none else being in the Room : Dockray produced several Witnesses for his good Reputation , and the Prosecutor was of the belief he was innocent , but that Sarah Carter had privately Stole the Sheet , however they were both Acquitted . There was only one Person , viz . Peter Anderson received Sentence of Death this Sessions . Christopher Gage Burnt in the Hand . John Butler craved benefit of his Clergy , but when he came to the Book could not read , so upon his further Importunity , was set aside for Transportation . James Wilson , and Susan Morgan , being each found Guilty to the value of 10d . only ; have Judgment to be Whipt . Samuel Lambourne , who was the last Sessions Sentenced to dye for Stealing a Gelding of a great Price , but had the favour to be Reprieved , being one amongst others that since attempted to break the Goal , is now appointed to be Hanged .
