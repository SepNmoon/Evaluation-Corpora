With the true number of persons that are Condemned , burnt in the Hand , and to be Transported . London , Printed with Allowance , 1975 . An Account of the Tryals and Proceedings this last Sessions holden at the Old Bayly , begun upon the 14. day instant , 1675 . AT this Sessions were Tried a great number of Malefactors , whose crimes as they were various and of several Natures , so some of them were so inconsiderable , as not worthy the remarquing ; yet we shall briefly give you an account of some of the less considerable amongst them , and a more full Narrative of others of a more respective notice . Three men were this Sessions Indicted for the Felonious taking away of three ounces of Silver from a Refiner , some of them it seem 'd used to work at the Refiners house , and therefore were the more strangely suspected to be guilty , and the Silver being offered to be sold , and staid upon suspition , one of the peices was affirmed upon evidence to belong to the Gentleman that lost them , and some other circumstances to clear the Fact , but on the Prisoners part it was alleadged , that one of them had found the said Silver wrapped up in a bag near White-Fryers in Fleet-street , the whole matter being left to the Jury , they were acquitted . An account was given you the last Sessions before this of the Tryal of a Maid Servant to a Linnen Draper , whowas accused by a young Lad ( an Apprentice in the same house for instigating him to burn the wares in his Masters house with Fire-balls , and to take mony out of the box , which the boy then confessed in his evidence against her , that upon her instigation he did it , the Maid was then acquitted , but upon the aforesaid confession , and some other circumstances since discovered to evince the Fact , the young Lad was this Sessions arraigned uppon three several Indictments , the one for taking the mony to the value of three pound out of the box , the other of Trespass , for burning the goods in the house , the other of Felony , for setting fire to the burning of the house ; the evidence that came in against him was no other ( except in one single circumstance ) then what was given in upon the last Tryal , and what he confessed before the Justice upon his Examination . The Master affirmed that he did prosecute him to no other end but to get a discovery of what persons were accessaries with him , and that should put him upon the Design , as supposing it very unlikely that a young boy about 13 years of Age , should enterprize so mischievous an undertaking of himself ; The Court laboured very much to make him confess who were his complices , but the boy still resolutely held to his first Story , that it was the Maid that set him upon it , and no body else . It appeared that the damage by the fire was chiefly to the goods , and no great damage done to the house , although the fixing of any part of it according as the Indictment was laid , would have been Felony without Clergy ( the State upon which the Indictment was grounded , being very severe in those cases , it appeared the boyes Friends were very sufficient persons , and had give 70 l.with him , and a bond of 500 l. for his truth , but besides that , the Master confessed that he had been offered full satisfaction of his damages by the boyes friends , if he would have desisted from Prosecuting , which the Master affirmed still he did only to discover the complotters by that means in the business , upon the whole matter the Jury found him as to the second Indictment for firing the House , not guilty ; and as to the taking mony out of the Box , they brought in a special Verdict , grounded tis suppos 'd upon a clause in 21 . Hen . 8.7. concerning Servants taking their Masters goods not being Apprentices , the like course being taken in a case much of the same nature the day before . A woman was here also Indicted for the Murthering of her Bastard-child which she had hid in a Box , and was there discovered ; it being questioned as the Law requires in such cases , whither the cryed out at the time of her Delivery , she affirmed she did , and that a Woman ( one of the witnesses ) at that time lay with her , but that she could not wake her ; the said woman affirmed that she did not acquaint her , nor did she suspect any thing of her condition , but that the other rose from her , and went into another Room , where it seems she was delivered , and the child afterwards found dead in the aforesaid box : The Jury brought her in guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] A Sadler also here was tryed for killing one Henderson Brother and follower to the bayly of the Liberty of the Dutchy in the Strand ; this Sadler it seems had several times notice given him of an Action against him in the Court of the Liberty , and an appearance desired to it , which he refusing , the aforesaid Henderson and his brother came to his Shop and Arrested him , whereuponthe Prisoner desiring to stay a little while in his house , till he could send for Bayle , got them into his Kitching and then getting out the parties Sword that was killed , did therewith first wound the Bayly , and presently turning to his follower , with a suddain pass , run him through the body , of which wound , within two or three days after , he died , The Jury found him guilty of Murther . [ Death . See summary . ] A Porter was here Arraigned for running away with a Trunk that he was to have carried with one that imploy 'd him . He made it seems an excuse to rest him by the way , but never rested till he carried it clean away . A Broker was here Indicted this Sessions as accessary ( before the Fact ) which one Ed . Fox , Caryl , and others , who had formerly rob 'd the Lord Manchester s Lodgings at Whitehall , Caryl , one of the principals , having been convicted of the said offence , but afterwards had License of Transportation , came in a witness against him , that upon the discovery of their aforesaid intended design , this Broker by trade did incourage them to it , and that they should take no care for the disposing of their booty , for he would contrive ways for the disposing of them , and did so , The Tryal was long , but this was the sum of the Evidence , upon which he was convicted as accessary to the aforesaid Felony . [ Death . See summary . ] A young man was also Tryed for the Robbery of one Mr. Howard of 90 l. he was taken near St. James 's upon Thursday night last about 10. at night , upon suspition by a person of whom he inquired if he could tell him where he might hire a Horse to ride out of Town , thisthe party seeing him but an ordinary erpson , and wondering what he should hire a Horse for at that time of Night , and observing withal that he had a Wallet at his back , which he dropt quickly after ; upon these suspitions was laid hold on , and carried him and his Wallet before a Justice of Peace , where the Wallet was search 'd , and found 90 l. in it , and some Suits of cloaths which he confessed he had of Mr. Howards man , at his Tryal it appeared that the said Mr. Howards man had left his Masters service for about a Twelve month , and yet the said Master had so much confidence in him , as to trust him with the said 90 l. in his keeping , and that the Prisoner , at the instance of the Landlord of the house where he lodged with him about a month before , and that Thursday had got the said mony and cloaths from him , and went away with him , the Prisoner alledged , that the other had told him whose mony it was , and ordered him to carry them away to a place where he should meet him , and there they were to divide the mony between them , but upon information given to the Court , of the Gentlemans confidence of his Servants integrity , this was lookt upon but as an invention to shift the crime from himself to the other , and the credit thereof being left to the Jury , they brought him in guilty of the Felony . There were besides these a great number of other Falonyes burglaries , and petty Larcenyes , too long to reherse in this short Narrative . There were in all twenty condemned to be hanged , 16. men and 4 women one of which women was the before mentioned person for Murthering her Bastard , and of the men , the Sadler that Killed the Bayly ; and theBroker before mentioned . The Sadler carried himself very submissively and Christianly at his condemnation , declaring that he expected not life , and could not plead for it , but in respect he had been so little time in Prison , and that the time he had been there was taken up with visits by his friends , desired of the Court that they would grant some more than usual time before his Execution , to prepare for his Soul , to which the Court declared they would take into consideration , and so proceeded to pass judgment of death upon him . There were in all 21 Persons burned in the hand , and about 9 more to be Transported .
