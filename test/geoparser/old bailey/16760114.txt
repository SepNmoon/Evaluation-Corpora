LONDON : Printed for D. M. in the Year 1676 . A true NARRATIVE Of the Proceedings at the Sessions-house IN THE OLD-BALY . I Shall , with as much brevity and truth as may be , give you a candid account of the trials of the several Prisoners at the Old-Bayly ; and begin first with an Irish man servant to a Person of Quality , who was indicted for stealing two hundred pounds from his said Master ; but thought some circumstances seem 'd to stick close to him , yet he was acquitted by the Jury . The next were two Youngster s that came to a Pastery-cook 's house , and called for a Chamber and a Fire , and there continued till they had ordered their business , so as to take two Silver Tankards away with them : one went out of the door , and the other out of the window by a small Rope . The first was taken and tried , and found guilty ; the last escaped with the Booty . After this a Milliner was indicted for breaking open a shop in Covent garden ; but the principal Evidence was one who had encouraged the sufferers to prosecute the said Millener ; but in regard several pieces of Ribbin were found in the Milleners shop , that were taken out of the said shop in Covent garden ; the Judge gave orders for another Bill to be drawn against the Milliner , and that he should be indicted as an accessary , upon which he was found guilty . After this , one was indicted for stealing several Sheep , four of which were found in his custody , and also the skins of many more ; so that he pleaded guilty to all Felonies within the benefit of the Clergy upon his first Indictment . The next was one who was arraigned and tried for a Burglary committed in the house of a person of quality in the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields ; he running from thence was stopped by a Blackamore : but nothing being taken away , he was acquitted . After this a woman was indicted , for that she together with two men , not yet taken , went into a house in the City , and pretended themselves persons of quality , one of the men saying he was Steward to a person of Honour , and the other a Gentleman newly come from Ireland ; they desired Lodgings , and their requests were answered , and at night , it being Christmas time , they desired to play a game at Cards , for their divertisement , with their Landlord , and he to oblidge them readily compli 'd ; but the Landlady being gone a gossiping or visiting , and none left but her Husband and these new-come-gentlefolks at home , they desired him to send out for some Double Beer for them ; he stept to the next door and bid the Maid bring it in after that they called for Wine , and he sent the sameMaid to Fetch it ; then a little after they desired that he would fetch them some more Double Beer himself , and as soon as he was gone they took a Candle and run up stairs to his Chamber and broke his Closet open , and took from thence a silver Tankard and Money , to the value of twenty pounds , and left him only a light upon the stairs to see his losses : Away mareh 'd they , but some days after this woman was met with and brought , to Newgate , and from thence to the Bar , where she pleaded that one of the men that took away the Money and Plate was her Husband , and produced a Certificate from the Parson of Pancross to affirm it ; but the Jury supposing it to be counterfeit , found her guilty , and the chiefest comfort she is like to have is transportation . Now follows a bloody Murther committed by one in Whitechappel ; as soon as a Bayliff had told him that he arrested him , he with a strange Weapon run the Officer into the belly , and made a pass at another , but though he mist his body , he hit his clothes : This Hector with new supplies , was quickly secur 'd ; and when one told him that he had kill 'd the Bayliff , he repli 'd , if I have not I wish I had , and being sent from the Justice of Peace to Newgate , he told his Guard , if he had not killed him he should have gone to Prison on foot , but now in a Coach ; but for all he made so slight o n't then , he was in a more serious and sensible humour at the Bar , and labour 'd to excuse it with all the Rhetorick he had , and all was too little , for the Jury brought him in guilty , and Jack Ketch will make him free . Another unhappy Murther haypened at Westminster by the discord of two young Lad s , who quarrel 'd about cutting their Apron-strings , being Shoomaker s , the younger not knowing how to revenge himself , took a three peny Knife and stabb 'd the other , who run out of the Shop with his Bowels in his hands , cri 'd , Lord have mercie upon my Soul , Daniel has kill 'd me . The Lord Chief Baron after he had heard the Evidence , wish 'd the Jury to consider whether the boy understood what he had done or not , he being but thirteen years and a month old , the Jury afterwards brought him in guilty of Man 's Slaughter . Then a woman was indicted for High-treason ; she came into a shop and desired the Master thereof to give her two six pences for a shilling , he took the shillling , and perceiving it to be clipt , told her that she deserved to be questioned how she came by it ; upon which she run out of the shop as fast as she could , then persuite was made after her , and she was overtaken and brought back and carried before a Justice of Peace , who upon Ezamination , said , her Husband gave it to her ; they asked where she lodged , and having found her Lodgings out , they found Pots and Sheers , and other necessaries for that Imployment ; but in regard they rather supposed her absent Husband to be guilty than her ; the Jury favourably brought her in not guilty . After this , another was indicted for killing one at Clarendon house with a Saw ; he was making a Tool , and the deceased told him he should make none there , the other said he would ; then the deceased struck at him two or three times , which occasioned the other to strike him upon the arm with a Mallet , which he wasthen using , the deceased challeng 'd the other to fight , but he desired quietness , and would not ; then the deceased went to lock him in , the other prevented him by being too quick ; then he giving some more blows , the other struck him with the back of a Saw which he had in his hand , and his Hat being off he split his skull almost to his brains , of which wound he died in a little time ; and in regard , it did not appear to be a premeditated Quarrel , the Offender was only found guilty of Manslaughter . Another was tried for Murther , who happened into a house in Black fryers with a young man : After breakfast was ended , they had a few quarrelsome words ; he that was kill 'd affronted the other both in words and blows , and not being satisfi 'd with that , urged him to wrestle with him , who refus 'd it and left the room ; then he followed him and continued his abuses so long till at last he threw him down two or three times ; they parted then , and he that occasion 'd the quarrel was arrested the next day ; and continuing in a poor condition upon the boards , and induring other hardship he died ; so that one made affidavit that the deceased charged him that quarrelled with him , for the murthering of him , by throwing him down several times and falling upon him , but the Chyrurgeon cleared him of that guilt , who supposed it a natural death , therefore he was acquitted . Readers , what can subdue , what can asswage The bloody hands of men this sinful age ? A servent Prayer from a religious heart : These and far greater Judgments can divert . Then labour hard for such a frame as this , By which you Heav'n may gain , and Hell may miss . A Youg man and Woman were tried for a Fellony committed by them at Wapping , the Woman being entertained as a Servant , did the next day run away with a Silver Tankard , a Farrenden-gown , and many other things . The Gentlewoman missing them , used all the endeavours she could to procure them , and employing a Thief - catcher , by the description given of her , he directed her to the Servant-Maid that stole them from her ; who being apprehended told them where they were pawn 'd and sold , and how the Young man bid her sell them , and if she was questioned , he would come to justifie that the Goods belonged to her Mistress , who employed her to sell them . There being proof enough to make him appear an Accessary , they were both found guilty of Fellony . A Porter was tryed for Burglary , but it appeared that the Woman prosecuted him out of envy ; for she said , that he came and broke open her House one Morning ; whereas others of more repute said , That he was very familiar with her , and that same Night did continue with her from Five at Night till Seven in the Morning , and he pawn 'd his Silver Ticket for Five Shillings , and sent for Six Penny worth of Ale , and call 'd in a Black-Pudding man to give her a Treat . Several Persons spoke in his behalf , and said , That he was a very honest man : And there being no proof that he had taken any thing from her , he was acquitted . There was an Irishman tryed for a Cheat , which was as follows , He with a Footman came to a Watchmaker s Shop , and desired to see some Watches for his Master ; after he had seen several , he pitch 'd upon two , and desired that he would carry them or send them to his Master , he therefore sent his man with them , the one being a gold the other a silver Watch , and when they came to the Temple he desired to carry them up to his Master , whom he pretended was in bed , but as soon as he had got them he run away with them ; the other persued him , and afterwards brought him to a Justice of Peace , and he committed him to Prison , and upon his Tryal was found guilty of the Cheat . [ Pillory . See summary . ] There were three men and three women condemned , four ordered to be transported , and sixteen burn 'd in the hand , and five to be whipt at the Carts tail , and the said Cheat design 'd for the Pillory .
