Nicholas Thompson , and George Alder , of St. Mary Islington , were indicted for stealing a Weather Sheep , val . 25 s. the Property of William Robinson , June 14 . Christopher Day . I live at the Angel-Inn , Islington . About the 13th or 14th of June last , I missed this Sheep of Mr. Robinson 's out of my Field , and on the Sunday following the Skin was brought to me , by a Person who had pick 'd it up . The next Day about 12 o'Clock , Word was brought me that two Men were taken up at Westminster , and that some Mutton was found upon them . I then came up to London , and found the Prisoners in the Gate-House : I took them before Mr. De Viel , before whom they confessed that they went into the Field , and took the Sheep . They very particularly described the Field , and said they came up some Steps and over a Stile to get into the Field , and that there was a sort of a rising Hill or Bank in it . They said they took the Sheep up the Field and dressed it , and left part of it under a Hay-Cock . Prisoners . Were there no other Sheep in the Field but this ? Day . Yes , a great many . Prisoners . What does Robinson mark his Sheep with , that you can swear to the Skin ? Day . A Fleur de Lis , and I think there were some other Marks on the Shoulder . John Ilsley . On Sunday the 14th of June last , at 11 o'Clock at Night , I met the Prisoner Alder in King's-Street , Westminster , in a very odd posture . He had got something that made him go almost double . I was going to stop him , but the Wheel of a Coach , which was then going along , falling off , I ran to the assistance of the People who were in the Coach . Before I could overtake him again he had got as far as Tothill-Street , and the Neighbours who were standing at their Doors , called out to the Watchmen to stop him . They did so , and brought him to the Watch-House : I was present and saw the hind quarter of a pretty large Sheep , and the Neck and Breast taken from him . I asked him how he came by it ? and he said he had it from one Thompson as part of a Debt . I saw that it was not kill 'd in the manner that Butchers kill their Meat , and so I took him to the Gate-House , and the next Morning carried him before Mr. De Viel . He still kept to the same story , and said he could tell us the Man whom he had it from ; upon that he went with us to Thompson 's Lodging , and on my asking him if he had ever sold any Mutton to Alder , he said , he had not . I immediately secur 'd him , and on searching the Room , I found a Hind Quarter of Mutton hanging in a Closet , which proved to be part of the same Sheep which I found on Alder . I likewise found part of the Fat wrapp 'd up in an old Shirt . From thence we carried them before Mr. De Viel again , and they both said it signified nothing denying it , for they did steal it out of the Field , and had part of it for dinner on Sunday . James Falconer . I stopped the Soldier , ( Alder ) with the Load under his Coat , in King's-Street , Westminster . I put my Hand into the Bag , and felt that there was flesh in it . He said it was Mutton , and he had it from a Man in Holbourn that owed him 18 s. and that he took it for half of his Debt . I had a suspicion that it was stolen , so I took him to the Watch-house , and from thence he was carried to the Gate-House . Thomas Cutler . The Prisoner Alder was brought to the Gate-house about half an hour past 11 o'Clock ; and the next Morning I had him before Colonel De Viel . I was likewise present when Thompson and Alder were together before the Justice , and they both said it signified nothing to deny it , for they stole the Sheep out of Primrose Hill , and were both equally concerned . I saw the Mutton which was found in Thompson 's Room , and it appeared to be part of the same Sheep , as that which we found upon the other Prisoner Alder . Mr. Day . The Field from whence I lost this Sheep is call 'd Primrose-Hill . Prisoner Thompson . We were taking a walk , and being weary we sat down under a Hay-Cock to rest , and found this Mutton . John Philips . I was before Mr. De Viel and heard Alder say , they took this Mutton out of a Field going to Highgate , but I did not hear Primrose-Hill mention 'd . As to his Character ; we enlisted him in August last , when we lay in Hounslow Camp , and he lay in my Tent , when I have had to the value of 40 l. in it , and I never miss 'd any thing . Jane Barclay . Alder used our House , the Running Footman , in Drury Lane , and paid honestly for what he wanted . Sarah Tailor . I keep the Running Footman in Drury Lane , and he always paid me for what he had . William Standix . I have known Thompson ever since the Year 1739 , and never saw any thing , dishonest by him . Both Guilty 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5 , 6. Thomas Steers and Thomas Gloide of St. Martin in the Fields , were indicted for assaulting , Arabella Strickland on the King 's Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a cloth Cloak , val . 7 s. a silk Handkerchief , val . 1 s. a linen Apron , val . 2 s. a linen Cap , val . 18 d. a Straw Hat , val . 2 s. and 6 s. 6 d. in Money , the Goods and Money of Arabella Strickland ; March 10th . At the Prisoner 's desire , the Witnesses were examined apart . Arabella Strickland . I took a Coach No 248 , at 2 o'Clock in the Morning , on the 10th of March , a little on this side Charing-Cross . The Prisoner Steers was then on the Coach Box , and I desired him to drive me to the highest end of Bridges-Street , by Covent Garden . When I came to Catharine Street , I call 'd out to him stop ; he did not regard me , but continued going on till he came to Somerset House . When we got thither , I heard a Man say , D - n you , you Rascal , what Business have you with my Coach ? The Prisoner Steers then open 'd the Coach-Door , and I thought he was going to let me out , but instead of that , he came into the Coach to me , and one hand he employed in a very indecent manner , the other he put into my Pocket , and took out 6 s. 6 d. I begg 'd for God 's sake that he would let me alone , and I would pay him , but he paid no regard at all to what I said . Jury . Did any other Man appear at the same Time ? Strickland . No , the other Man kept beating me with the Butt End of his Whip all the Time . Q . When you desired them to let you alone , what followed ? Strickland . Steers went out at the Backside of the Coach , and the other came in , and offered to be rude with me . While Steers was in the Coach with me , another Man ( I ca n't tell who it was ) poked in his Whip at the Window , and with the Handle of it struck out two of my sore Teeth . As soon as Steers had pick 'd my Pocket he went out , and the other Man came in ; upon that I called out Watch as loud as I could , and then Steers took me by the Cloak and pulled me out of the Coach upon the ground . When I was out of the Coach , 2 Women came up and said , d - n you , you B - ch , what Business have you with our Husbands , and gave me several Blows ; I cry 'd out , and then the Prisoner Steers cut me with the small End of the Whip . This was over against Somerset House , and the Soldiers there hearing the Disturbance came to my Assistance , and the Men took to their Coach and drove away , to a Cellar by the New-Church . Q . What Condition did they leave you in ? Strickland . Without my Cap , Handkerchief , Cloak and Apron ; and all over Blood . I lost these Things at the same Time that I lost the Money , and they took them from me . Q . Are you sure the Prisoners are the Persons who robb 'd you ? Strickland . I can swear to the Prisoner Steers , and Gloide own 'd before the Justice that he was with him . Q . When they stopped with their Coach at this Cellar-Door , what follow 'd ? Strickland . I went with 3 Watchmen to the Cellar , and they asked me if I knew the Men ; I told them I knew one of them for he had a Scar on his Eye ; so we went down into the Cellar , and neither of the Prisoners were there ; but we found them both in a back Room , and although they had changed Coats , I knew Steers to be one of the Persons that robbed me . There were a great many Men in the Cellar , and the Watchmen were afraid of them , and told me if I took the Number of the Coach that was sufficient . This was on the Monday Morning about 2 o'Clock , and on Tuesday I went to the Hackney-Coach Office , and a Man there told me that Mr. Clark , the Master of the Coach , was a very civil Man , and the Matter might be made up for about 2 Guineas , but I was informed I could not do it ; so Mr. Clark and Steers were both summoned to appear . On the Friday following I went again to the Office , and Clark appeared , but Steers did not . Mr. Clark desired that I would not indict his Coach , and gave me a Crown , and promised to get a Warrant against Steers to take him , and if he could not take him in a Week , he would give me another Crown . The Prisoners both kept out of the Way , and were not taken till the 14th of June , at which Time they were carried before Mr. De Viel . Q . As the Distance between the Commission of this Robbery , and the apprehending the Prisoners was so great , could you remember either of their Faces ? Strickland . Yes , there were 2 Lights against the Place where Steers took me up ; - it was just by St. Martin 's Lane . Q . When the Prisoners were taken could you remember any Thing as to Gloide ? Strickland No , I could not swear to him . Q . Could you recollect that he was the Person whom you had seen in the Cellar with Steers ? Strickland . Yes , I knew him to be the same Person . Q . When the Prisoners were before Mr. De Viel did they own any Thing ? Strickland . Yes , Steers owned that he horse-whipped me , but I do n't remember that he owned the robbing me ; but I am sure the Person that horse-whipped me was the same that robbed me . Q . Did Gloide confess any Thing ? Strickland . Gloide only owned that he attempted to commit Indecencies with me , but that I would not let him . Q . Can you recollect any Thing else that they confessed ? Strickland . No nothing else ; they said they horse-whipped me because they thought I was a Whore . Prisoners . Did not she own to several People that she was very much fuddled ? Strickland . No , I never did , for I was not fuddled . Prisoners . Do you know one Mrs. Murphey or Mrs. Rockham ? Strickland . No , I do not . Prisoners . Did not you say the Women tore your Pocket off ? Strickland . No , they only beat me , and asked me what Business I had with their Husbands . Steers . What was the Reason that you staid so long as from March to June before you took us up ? Strickland . Mr. Clark told me he would take them up , besides I was taken very ill . Prisoners . Did not you hear that we were both at our Stand in the Day Time ? Strickland . They were only out at Nights ; besides I was ill and could not go about to look after them . Stephen Haydon . I am a Watchman . On the 10th of March , about 2 in the Morning , this Woman , Strickland , came to my Stand , the Corner of Catharine Street , and appeared to be very much abused . She desired me to go with her , for she had like to have been murdered . I told her I had heard the Lashes of a Whip for near half an Hour , but it being out of my Parish I durst not venture to go , except she could call the other Watchmen out of the Strand . She got 3 other Watchmen , and we all went together to Woodward 's Cellar , where the Coach was standing . The other Men desired me to go down first ; accordingly I did , and when I came down I saw the Coachman , Steers shuffling about from one Table to another , endeavouring to hide his Whip . I accused about half a dozen Men in the Cellar , and asked the Woman if she knew any of them ; she said she did not , but when I came to Steers , she fell on her Knees , and wished she might never rise more if he was not one of the Men . Q . Did she take Notice of any other Man at that Time ? Haydon . No , she did not ; she said nothing of Gloide then . Q . When you discovered Steers would she have charged you with him ? Haydon . Yes , but I said the Number of the Coach was sufficient , and there were so many Men in the Cellar that I was afraid we should have our Brains beat out . In a little Time afterwards the Prisoner Steers came out of the Cellar , and I would have pushed the Woman away , but she looked in his Face and said , this is the Person that whipped me , upon which he turned about and said ; d - n you , you B - ch , for half a Farthing I would horse whip you again . The next Day I went with the Prosecutrix to the Coach-Office about the Number of the Coach , and the Master of it was summoned , and on his appearing , he gave her a Crown , and promised her another if he did not take Steers in a short Time . Q . Was you before the Justice with the Prisoners ? Haydon . Yes , and I heard Steers own that he whipped her with a double thong 'd Whip : The Justice asked them , what they went into the Coach for , and one of them , I think it was Gloide , smiled and said , with Intent to lie with her . Prisoners . When she came to you at your Stand , did she say she had been robbed ? Haydon . Yes , she said she had been robbed of her Landlady 's Cloak , her Cap , and 6 s. 6 d. in Money , and desired me to go and take the Persons . Prisoners . Did not she charge some Women with the Robbery ? Hay don . No , she said she was robbed by 2 Men , and 2 Women came and beat her . Thomas Clark . At the Time of the Commission of this Fact Thomas Steers was my Servant . On the 9th of March last , he drove a Hackney-Coach for me , No . 248 , and on the Wednesday following a Summons came with a Complaint against that Number to appear at the Office on the Friday . On the Thursday Morning , I went up Stairs to call the Prisoner as usual , and informed him of this Summons , and of the Complaint : He said , he knew nothing of it , but however if he was to be sent to Newgate he would certainly appear . He lay a bed the best Part of that Day , and the next Day instead of appearing according to his Promise , he absconded , and I could not find him , so I went myself to the Office , and was informed that a Woman and two Watchmen had been to complain against me . I afterwards went into Covent Garden to see for Steers , but he was not to be found , so I went to the Office again , and the Prosecutrix was there , and told me she had been robbed of 6 s. 6 d. , her Cloak , Apron and Cap . I told her it was out of my Power to produce the Man , but if she would not appear against me at the Office , I would give her a Crown then , and another if I did not take him in a Week . In about a Week afterward she was taken ill , and I went to see her , and gave her 5 d. or 6 d. to get blooded . We got a Warrant from Justice De Viel , and Steers was taken ; Glide was taken the same Morning at 10 o'Clock , and carried before the Justice . Q . What passed when you were before the Justice ? Clark . Steers being asked why he left my Coach , said , he was taken ill at Temple-Bar , and sent Glide away with it , and ordered him to bring it again at 2 o'clock . He said , Glide , did not return with the Coach , upon which he went to see for him at Woodward 's Cellar , where he had left Word that he was gone to Westminster . That he saw the Coach in the Strand , with a Linkman on the Box , and a Man and Woman in the Coach : that he pulled the Woman out of the Coach , and gave her 3 or 4 Strokes with his Whip . Gloide said he was in the Coach at the same time , and would have lain with the Woman , but did not . Prisoners . Where does this Woman live ? Clark . She lodged then at one Whitehead 's in King 's Court , Russel Street , Covent Garden . Steers . Did not you see me from the time that you got the Warrant , to the time that I was taken ? Clark . I have seen him once or twice since , but he kept out of the Way . I told him there was a Warrant against him , and he said he did not value it , for it was only going to Bridewell for 7 Days . - Black . I am a Constable in St. Giles 's Parish . When I had Steers in Custody , I carried him before Mr. De Viel , but he not being at Home , I left him in the Custody of 2 or 3 Men at the Brown Bear in Bow Street , while I went to see after Gloide . I took him out of Bed , and told him I wanted him to come and speak in the Behalf of Steers ; and he said he had nothing to say but what would hurt him . When we had them both together before the Justice , Gloide owned that he attempted to lie with the Woman , and Steers said he horse-whipped her with a double Thong . DEFENCE . Steers . I sent Gloide with the Coach , and thinking he staid long , I went several times to see after him . I went to Woodward 's Cellar , and while I was there , the Coach stopped on the other Side of Somerset House Water Gate . I went to see what was the Reason that it did not come up , and saw a Fellow on the Box , and Gloide and this Woman in the Coach . The Woman got out of the Coach and went up Catharine Street , and I went to Woodward 's Cellar again , and watered my Horses , intending to go Home , and Gloide gave me my great Coat , which I had lent him to drive in . In a few Minutes this Woman came with this Watchman to the Cellar , and she said she had been robbed by 2 Women . The Watchman asked her whether I belonged to the Coach , and she said I was one of them , and she would swear to my Coat . Gloide . This Man sent me with his Coach , and as I was coming by the Corner of Southampton Street , the Woman called after me and desired me to give her a Cast ; so I put her into the Coach and asked her to do so and so ; she asked me if I was found , I told her I was not , and then she said she would have nothing to say to me . David Lloyd . Between 12 and 2 o'Clock , on the 10th of March , to the best of my Knowledge , I was locked out , and waiting at Temple Bar , for my Master Withers 's Work , Gloide asked me to go to Westminster with him with a Job . As we came back from Westminster , that Woman was standing at the Corner of Southampton Street . Gloide got off the Box , and said , My Dear , will you take a Ride in the Coach ; she said she did not care to trust herself with a Man , but if he would not hurt her she would . They both got into the Coach , and I drove on slowly to Somerset House , and then the Coachman came up , and cut me over the Legs with his Whip , for driving his Coach . Gloide jump 'd out , and Steers took the Woman out , and used his Whip a little about her . The Woman cried out Watch ! but as for seeing him put his Hands near her Clothes , I did not . The Coach stood about 2 Yards beyond Somerset House ; and I did not go above 10 Yards , but stood by the Watch House all the Time , and saw what passed . Q . How came you to be locked out ? Lloyd . I had been drinking with my Brother in Law , Jemmy Scott , at the Night House , by Temple-Bar . Joshua Murphey . I am a Housekeeper in Lewkener 's Lane . This Woman ( Strickland ) told me that the two Women took her Cloak , Hat , and Cap ; that the Men had used her ill , but she was in Liquor , and could swear to but one of them that had robbed her . Mary Buckham . I sell Smallcoal-Dust in Lewkener 's Lane . I heard the Prosecutrix say at her own Lodgings , that the 2 Women robbed her of her Landlady 'd velvet Hood and Cloak , and that Gloide did not hurt her , but Steers horse-whipped her . Gloide was taken at my House , and I desired the Man to let him go loose , and he did so . Q . When did you go to Strickland 's Lodgings ? Buckham . About a Fortnight ago ; Mr. Murphey was with me , and she said Steers horse-whipped her , the Women punched her , and she lost 6 s. 6 d. but Gloide did not hurt her , for she asked him a Question , and he told her the Truth , and she would not hurt him . Gloide 's general Character is , that he is a Fool , and foolish Tom Gloide is a common Word in our Neighbourhood . Margaret Leneve . I keep the Dolphin in Dark-house Lane . Last Tuesday Morning , the Prosecutrix was at our House , and said she had been robbed in a Hackney Coach , but wished she might be damned if she knew the Men , till one of them was shewn to her in a Night-Cellar . She said the Man had a Scar under his Eye , and she would swear to that . She said the other was very rude with her , and I said , it may be he robbed you ; she said he did not , and she would not hurt him , but swore she would hang Steers for he horse-whipped her as she came out of the Coach . John Johnson . I went to Leneve 's last Tuesday Morning to get some Refreshment , and saw this Woman ( Strickland ) a Man , and Mrs. Leneve in Discourse together . Mrs. Leneve asked her who robbed her ; she said she could not tell whether it was a Coachman or Tradesman , till he was shewn to her by a Man in the Night-Cellar . Thomas Marsham . I am a Gravesend Waterman , and seeing this Woman and a Man go into the Dolphin in Darkhouse Lane , I plyed them , but they were not going by Water , so they asked me to go in and drink with them . I did so , and heard her say , some Men had prompted her to this , or else she had not done it , and if she could save one of the Prisoners she would , but would hang the other . She was asked who the Persons were that robbed her ; and she said she did not know whether he was a Tradesman or a Coachman , and she could not swear to him till a Man shewed him to her in the Night-Cellar . Elizabeth Seymour . My Father keeps an Ale-Cellar in the Strand : His Name is William Woodward . The Prisoner Steers came to our Cellar about 2 o'Clock in the Morning , - I ca n't tell the Day : He staid some Time , and then went away ; and in a quarter of an Hour or less , returned with the other Man , Gloide . They had not been there long before Strickland and the Watchman came down , and when somebody shewed her Steers , she said , this is the Man who whipped me out of the Coach . I was then in a back Room , and the Watchman said he would take the Number of the Coach , and they went away together without mentioning a Word of a Robbery . Stephen Banks . I keep the Coach and Horses in Charles-Street , Covent-Garden ; and as to the Character of the Prosecutrix , she is a common Street-Walker . Steers always bore an honest Character , and I never knew him rob any Body in my Life . Samuel Spencer . I have known Strickland 3 or 4 Months ; she lives at one Whitehead 's in King 's Court , Russel Street , and is a common Street Walker . I have known Steers between 12 and 13 Years , and never heard any Harm of him . Thomas Woodward . I have known Steers about 18 Years , and never heard him accused of any Thing . He is as honest as myself , and I never robbed any Body . Samuel Smith . I have known Steers a dozen or 14 Years ; and he bears an exceeding good Character . Thomas Williamson . I have known him ever since I can remember , and his general Character is very good as far as ever I heard . Mary Stone .

I returned in about 5 or 6 Hours , and heard the Prisoner , who was my Servant , unlock my Chamber Door : I immediately ran up Stairs , and found the Door fast , with the Key in the Inside . We have an empty House backwards , and imagining he might make his Escape that Way , I took my other Apprentice with me to search ; but as soon as I had got down Stairs I heard my Chamber Door open , and somebody run up Stairs into the Garret . I ran up into the Garret likewise , and took the Prisoner from under the Bed . When I had taken him , I went into my Chamber , and found my Drawer broke open , but the Money was not taken away . - Painter . I am a Constable , and was sent for to take Charge of the Prisoner . I asked him how he came to use his Master so , and he said he did design to take the money ; that some People were waiting for it , and it was to be spent at the White-Conduit-House , in White-Conduit Fields . He owned he broke open the Drawer with this Knife , which we found on the Bed , according to his Directions , and said he put the Money into his Pocket , but hearing his Master come up , he laid it in the Place from whence he took it . - Long . I was present when the Prisoner was examined ; and heard him own this to be the Knife with which he broke the Drawers ; he said , he did take the Money and put it into his Pocket , but hearing his Master come up Stairs , he put it into the Drawer again .

I met her 2 or 3 Days afterwards in Bond Street , and asked her about the Money .

Are you sure you had all those Things about you , when you fell asleep ? J. R .. Yes , I am sure I had them when I went into the Room . Q . What Time did you awake ? J. R .. I ca n't say , because I had lost my Watch , but it was past 11 o'Clock before the Wells broke up , and after that I went into the Tap-House , and sat till it was pretty late . Q . Had you not been drinking , or were you sober ? J.R .. I could not be very sober to be sure , but I had my Senses enough to know that I had my Things when I went to sleep , because I looked out of the Window , and saw People milking their Cattle , and I thought to get some Milk , but I fell asleep , and when I 'wak 'd , I missed my Goods , and the Prisoners were all gone off . These two Boys were in the Room at the same Time , though I did not see them because they were covered over and hid . The Prisoners were taken and carried before Justice Manley , and when I came there , I found all these Things which are in the Custody of the Constable . These are the Shoe-Buckles ; here is one Knee-Buckle , and the Tobacco Stopper , and this is the Bag which contained the Money , but here is not half the Money I lost . Eliz . Eccles . Ask him if he knows this Shilling ? J. R .. Yes , this very Shilling was taken from me with the other Things : It is a leaden one , and I put it into my Fob-Pocket because I would not put it off . This Silver Portugal Piece was likewise taken from me . Gabriel Pikington . I was coming down Tothill-Street , Westminster on the 28th of May , in the Morning , and met the Prisoner Jones with a pair of new Shoes and Stockings on , but no Buckles in them . I followed her down the Street , and presently the other Girl came up equipp 'd in the same manner . The Prisoner Eades was with them , and they went into a Shop at the end of the Street and bought Buckles . The Neighbours desir 'd I would observe them , for they believed a Robbery had been committed , and I suspecting them myself , took them up and carried them before Justice Manley , and all these things were found upon them . This Purse and the Money were taken from Elizabeth Jones , and she owned she took it out of the Gentleman 's Pocket . The Watch was found on the Prisoner Eades in the Gate House , and he told me , that he pick 'd it out of J. R 's . Pocket . The Justice not thinking it proper to let all the Prisoners go together , committed the 2 least , Elizabeth and Mary Eccles , to Bridewell , and the 2 Boys informing us that some of the Things were deposited by the Girls in Bridewell , we sent for them again to the Justices , but before they came thither , Mary Eccles sent to Bridewell for the Buckles and Tobacco-Stopper , and own 'd they were J. R 's . property . The Prosecutor took this Handkerchief off the Prisoner Eades 's Neck , or out of his Hand , I can not tell which . Samuel White . I am 13 Years old , and know if I take a false Oath I shall go to the Devil . I was in the Room , and saw the Prisoner Jones take the Bag of Money out of the Gentleman 's Pocket , and his Buckles from his Shoes while he was asleep , and Eades pick 'd his Pocket of his Watch . Robert Paine . I am 13 Years old , and if I take a false Oath I must go to the Devil . I was in the Room and saw the Prisoner Eades take Mr. J. R 's . Watch while he was asleep . Elizabeth Jones took his Buckles and a little Bag with some Gold in it , but how much there was , I ca n't say . Prisoner Jones . Ask the Gentleman whether he had any Shoes on ? J. R. No , I had Boots , but the Buckles were taken out of my Pocket . White . The Buckles that I saw were taken out of his Knees ; I saw none taken out of his Pocket . Paine . I saw only the Knee Buckles taken . Pris . Eades . That Man came up about 4 o'Clock in the Morning while I was asleep ; he waked me , and gave these Girls Money to leave the Room . White . We were in the Room all the Time , and there was no such thing pass 'd , but what he says is entirely false . Q. to Paine . Upon the Oath that you have taken , did Mr. J. R. give the Girls any Money to leave him and Eades alone ? Paine . No . Mr. J. R. was asleep all the time . Pris . Jones . This Gentleman came up into our Room at 4 o'Clock in the Morning , and gave us this Money to quit the Room . We wanted some Clothes , and we had so much Money we did not know what to do with it , so we bought some things , and that Gentleman met us and took us before the Justice . Elizabeth Eccles . I was coming over Tower-hill , and met Mr. J. R. ; he clapp 'd me on the Shoulder , and said he would go home with me : I was not willing he should , but he dogg 'd me till I came to the House , and then he went up Stairs , and gave us the Money and this leaden Shilling to quit the Room , and leave him and Eades alone . Mary Eccles . I was a-bed with Eades and Jones , and J. R. brought this Girl into the Room , and he gave her the Money to take us down Stairs . J. R. Every Word of what they have said is absolutely false . Pilkington . When they were before the Justice , neither of them pretended to set up this Defence . Eades Guilty , Death ; Elizabeth Eccles , Mary Eccles , and Elizabeth Jones , guilty Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 17. John Scott , of St. Mary Stratford Bow , was indicted for stealing a Mare of a black Colour , val . 8 l. the Property of Thomas Wash ; May 31st . Thomas Wash . I have nothing to say but that I lost a black Mare from Colengale , in the County of Essex . I ca n't tell what became of it , but I afterwards found it at Mr. Edwards 's the Bell at Bow . Edward Edwards . On the 31st of May , between 5 and 6 in the Evening , the Prisoner brought a black Mare faddled and bridled , to my House , the Bell at Bow . He left her with me all Night , and went away to lie at another House . The next Morning he came to fetch her away , and when she came to the Stable Door , I seeing her Shoes were bad , immediately suspected her to be stolen , and stopp 'd her . When I had stopped her , the Prisoner came into the Yard , and I asked him whether the Mare was his own or not ; he said he had borrowed it of his Master Smith , who lived at Halstead in Essex , that his own Name was Smith , and he was going to Hounslow to a Kinsman of his Master 's . We were not satisfied with this , but took him before a Justice at Bow , and there he denied that his Name was Smith , and would not tell any Name , for he said if he did it would be the worse for him . The Justice then committed him to New-Prison , and I had the Mare cried at Rumford and Epping , and my next Door Neighbour , Mr. Cook the Collar-Maker , sent a Letter into the Country . On the Friday following , Mr. Wash came to my House , and owned the Mare , and had her away again . Wash . The Mare which I had from Edwards was the same that I lost . Q . How far from Bow is the Place where you lost your Mare ? Wash . It is about 40 Miles , and I miss 'd her at 5 o'Clock in the Morning . Robert Lay . I am a Neighbour of Wash 's and designed to have come to Town with him to see after the Mare , but Business prevented me , so I sat out the Day after him . When I came to London , hearing that the Mare was at Bow , I sent to the Spread-Eagle in Grace-Church Street to inform Wash of it , and he and I and John Darling went together to Bow . We found the Mare at the Bell , and I knew her to be same which Mr. Wash had lost . She was a black Mare , and had a white Spot on her Flank . John Darling . I was with Mr. Wash and the last Witness when they found the Mare at the Bell at Bow . It was a black Mare , and I am positive that she was the same that Mr. Wash lost . Richard Mander . I carried the Prisoner before Justice Haggard , and he refused to tell his Name , to I took him back , and carried him again several Times , but he would not let us know his Name , so he was committed as a Person unknown . Prisoner . I came up to London to see for Work , but there being none to be got , I left my Things , at Bow , and returned Home . When I got Home my Friends persuaded me to fetch my Things away , and not to go to work . My Father follows the farming Business , and gave me the liberty to take a Horse whenever I would . I got up early in the Morning , in order to come away , and there were some Horses in the Road , which I thought to be my Father 's , so I made bold to go into the Stable and take a Bridle and Saddle , and one of those Horses . I desire Mr. Wash may be ask 'd concerning my Character . Wash . He is a Neighbour 's Son . His Friends bear a very good Character , and I never heard any harm of him before this . Q . Does his Father live so near you , that your Horses run together ? Wash. No , they never go together , and I live half a Mile from him . Lay . I do n't know a great deal of the Prisoner ; his Friends bear a very good Character . Prisoner . I lived Servant with this Man . Lay . He did live with me about 3 quarters of a Year , and was a very good Servant to me . Guilty , Death . 18 , 19. Mary Smith , alias Rouse , and Mary Smith , of Pancras , were indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Minton , an Infant about the Age of 5 Years ; putting her in fear & c. and taking from her a Quilted Callimanco Coat , value . 4 s. and a Stay , val . 4 s. the Goods of John Minton , June 10th . John Minton . Elizabeth Minton is my Daughter , and all that I know of my own Knowledge , is , that the two Prisoners were apprehended for stripping her , and confessed the Fact before Mr. De Viel and said it was to buy the Prisoner Smith a Gown . Jane Shaw . I live at my Lord Vine 's in Albemarle-Street , and have this Child under my Care . On the 10th of June last I drest her in this Coat and Stay , and about 5 in the Afternoon gave her leave to go to play in the Street ; she was brought Home to me at 8 , by a Boy who told me he found her sitting on a Dung-hill without her Coat and Stay , and the Skirt of her Frock was cut from the Body , and pinn 'd about her . When I saw her she told me , she was carried away by two Girls , who promised her a plum cake , and took her things from her . Ruth Bagley . I live at Tottenham-Court , and being sent on an Errand to London , my Master 's Daughter call 'd to me as I was going along the Road . I ran to her directly , and going along the Fields the space of twenty yards , we saw a Child sitting on a Lay-stall or Dung-hill . My Master 's Daughter said to me , `` Ruth , I will be hang 'd if those 2 creatures `` have not stripped the Child , for I saw the `` old one have her by the hand . '' I went up to the Child and ask 'd her where those Women were ? She said she did not know , and that they had taken her Coat and Stay from her . We bid the Child sit still till we came back , and we would take them ; and accordingly went in pursuit of the Prisoners , and took them within two Fields of Pancras . The great one , Rouse , made several attempts to get over a Bank , but she could not , so she slung this Coat and Stay into the ditch . I took it up and shew 'd it to her , and she said we had stripp 'd the Child ourselves and laid it on her , and began to grow robustical : upon that we called a Man to our assistance and carried them to my Master 's , where we secur 'd them till we got help and carried them before Mr. De Viel . When they were before Mr. De Veil they were examined , and the great one said to the other , `` Mall , `` if it had not been to buy you a new Gown , I `` had not committed this Robbery . '' the other said , It was to serve herself and not her , and that she was a Field off when Rouse committed the robbery . Q . Did you hear the Prisoner Smith say she was with Rouse when she decoy 'd the Child away , or when she brought it back to the Lay-stall ? Bagley . She said she saw Rouse decoy the Child away , and offer her a Plum-cake . Sarah Giles . I was going down the Road , and saw the last Witness , who is Servant to my Father : I call 'd her to me , and saw this Child sitting on a Lay-stall . I said I believed those creatures had stripped the Child , for I saw the old one , Rouse , have her by the Hand , and the little one had something in her apron , but what it was I ca n't tell . Q . How far from the Lay-stall did you first see the Prisoners with the Child ? Giles . Very near a quarter of a mile ; they were leading the Child , and she said something to them , and they replied , Yes , we shall be there presently now . Q . When you saw the Prisoners with the Child , had she her Stay on ? Giles . No , she had only her Frock on . When we came up to the Lay-stall , we asked the Child if they had taken any thing from her , and she said they had taken her coat and stay : upon that we pursued the Prisoners , and got up with them . I asked the little one for the coat and stay , and she said she had none of it ; the great one came up and beat me , and said she supposed we had stripp 'd the child ourselves , and the little one was going to run away , but I catch 'd hold of her , and Francis Jennison coming to our assistance we secured them both . When we had secured both the Prisoners , we took them to our house , and when we had got an officer , carried them before Mr. De Veil , where the great one said that they took the child out of Albemarle-street , and the little one said , it was out of the Hay-Market . The great one , Rouse , likewise said if it had not been to have bought Smith a new gown , she should not have done this . Francis Jennison . On the 10th of June last , I and my wife were taking a walk to Pancras , and these 2 girls came down the Road crying stop thief ! I took hold of the Prisoner Smith , and she said she would shew me the ditch where the things were : accordingly I went with her to the ditch and took out this coat and stay , and she said her sister took them from the child and threw them in there . The Prisoner Rouse was all that time in this young woman 's hands , and we carried them to Mr. Giles 's at Tottenham-Court , where the great one own 'd she robbed the Child , and said it was to buy the little one a new gown . I kept them till a Constable came , and he carried them before Justice Trent , but he being busy , we had them before Mr. De Viel , where Rouse own 'd they took the Child from Albemarle-Street , and carried her to Tottenham-Court , but I did not then hear them say what they did to her . Q. to Giles . Is this Dung-hill or Lay-stall near the highway ? Giles . Yes , it is by the side of the highway . Bagley . It lies open to the highway , and there is neither hedge nor ditch between them . Prisoner Rouse . I have nothing to say , but that I know nothing at all of the matter . Both Guilty , Felony .

I went to him and brought him to my house , and he said the Prisoner , who is my servant , was the person of whom he had the goods . Upon this I carried the Prisoner before a Magistrate , and he own 'd that he mov 'd my goods away and sold them to Tompkins . Susannah Perk . The unhappy person at the Bar is my son : his character from his cradle has always been honest and just , and no one can charge him with a dishonest action . John Purcas .

I am 11 Years old , and if I do n't speak the truth God will not bless me . Counsel . Do you know the Prisoner ? Brown . Yes , his Name is George Johnson . Counsel . Can you recollect seeing him do any thing to any body at Hayes ? Brown . Yes , but I ca n't tell what Day it was ; it was on a Saturday Night , between 10 and 11 o'Clock . Counsel . What did you see done ? Brown . I saw him put the Man into the Ditch , hard by the Angel at Hayes . Counsel . What did you hear him say to the Man ? Brown . He damn 'd his Blood , and the old Man said , pray Sir do n't damn my Blood . The Prisoner then said he was a pilsering Rogue , and went to throw him over the Gate . Counsel . Was that before or after he put him into the Ditch ? Brown . Before he put him into the Ditch , and the old Man fell back again , and hit his Head against the Gate . Counsel . Do you think it was to assist the Man to get over the Gate ? Brown . No , the Prisoner took him up in his Arms , and threw him from him , and he fell with his Head against the Gate . Counsel . Did the Man make any Complaints after that ? Brown . He cried out of his Leg , but I did not see any Thing done to it . After the Prisoner had thrown him into the Ditch , I desired him to take him out ; he did so , and laid him in a Cart-Rut . Counsel . What became of the Prisoner after this ? Brown . He went in at the Angel and I went Home . Counsel . Did you ever see the old Man again ? Brown . No Sir , not 'till next Day in the Afternoon . Pris . Q . You say it was between 10 and 11 in the Evening , was there any Light there ? Brown . I ca n't tell whether there was or not , but I was just by the Prisoner . Pris . Q . How far from the Angel does your Father live ? Brown . He lives at Coombes , which is 13 Miles from the Angel . Pris . Q . How came you to be out at this time of Night ? Brown . My Mother and my Sister and I lived at my Aunt 's , about 2 Stones throw from the Angel , and my Sister called me out and said she thought some Soldiers were quarrelling . Q . Did you know the Prisoner before ? Brown . Yes , and I was just by him all the Time . Counsel . When you went Home did you tell any Body what you had seen ? Brown . Yes , I told my Aunt there was an old Man put into the Ditch almost as old as her . Mary Brown was called next , but was of so tender an Age , that it was thought proper she should not be sworn . Elizabeth Clark . Last Saturday was three Weeks , about ten o'Clock at Night , I saw the Prisoner at Hayes . Counsel . What did you see him do there ? Clark . I saw him bringing an old Man along the Road : I asked him if he had got a drunken Man , and he said , he was no more drunk than I was , but that he was an idle Fellow and a Rogue , and wanted to get into some Body 's House when he saw a Conveniency . He said he had brought him from Woodrosse 's , where he had lain long enough if he had been drunk to have been sober again , for he had been ever since 1 o'Clock coming from the Adam and Eve , which is about a Mile distant . My Sister keeps the Angel , and I told him she was very much obliged to him for bringing him here , and he said his Intention was to carry him out of the Parish , but d - n him , he would duck him well first . The old Man hearing him say so , said in a low Tone ; then I will cry out Murder : The Prisoner replied d - n his Blood , hear the Rogue , now he says he will cry out Murder . Then a young Fellow took the old Man up out of the Road , and laid him gently under the Gateway : I said , I believe the poor Soul was drunk , and wished somebody would take care of him ; and then I saw the Prisoner take him up in his Arms in Order to throw him over the Gate ; he fell short , and his Head hit upon the Gate , and the Prisoner said , d - n him , there let him lie . The old Man then cried out of his Leg , and one Mary Roberts asked him what was the Matter with it , but he made no Answer . Counsel . How long did the Deceased lie there ? Clark . I ca n't tell ; I heard no more of him for a quarter of an Hour , and then he lay at my Sister Walker 's Door , and the Prisoner said , come Mrs Walker , and see me put this Money into the Rogue 's Pocket , or else to-morrow he will swear I have robbed him . He put 14 d into his Pocket , and then I went away and saw no more of him till next Morning . I asked the Prisoner what he had done with the old Man , and he said , d - n him , he had ducked him several Times . Counsel . What passed after this ? Clark . I heard no more till a Man went by in the Night , who called to us , and said , we had turned a Man out of Doors drunk . I got out of Bed , and looked out of the Window ; the Deceased was then lying on the Ground , and a Man went to help him up , and said , d - n him , he will not stand . Presently afterwards another Man came by , and said the Man was dying , so I got up , and my Sister and I went down Stairs . She asked the old Man if he would have any Thing ; and he moved his Hand and Head , but could not speak . We called the Neighbours about us , and I put a little Rum , Water and Sugar in a Sp oon into his Mouth , but I ca n't tell whether he swallowed any of it . Counsel . Did you look at his Head or any part of him ? Clark . After he was dead , I looked at his Legs , and there was a sort of a scratch on one of them . I did not take Notice of his Head , neither did I see him strip 'd , but I saw his Clothes afterwards , and he had about half a pound of Raisins and a piece of Bread in his Pocket all wet . His Shirt was dry just on the Stomach , and the other Part was wet . He lived 'till 5 o'Clock in the Morning and then died . Counsel . Was any Body brought to look on him ? Clark . No , there was no Coroner or Surgeon sent for to examine him . Counsel . Do you apprehend , as the Deceased fell against the Gate , that could be the occasion of his Death ? Clark . I ca n't tell ; I am not a judge of that , but I do not believe it was . Christopher Marshal . One Saturday in May , about 5 weeks ago , I had occasion to travel that Way , and saw much such a man as the Prisoner pulling another rudely along the Road . I said , what makes you use the Man so roughly ; you will break his Legs ; do n't you see his Legs bend under him ? I imagined the Man was drunk , and so I did not stay , but kept jogging on , and left my Man behind , who saw more of the Affair . John Brett . I was coming from London with the last Witness , and saw the Prisoner standing by a poor Man who was in the Road . He made an offer to take him from the Ground , and I asked him what he was doing ? He said he was a drunken , sorry Fellow , and he would get him out of the Parish . I desired him to take the man out of the way of the carts and waggons , and he said he design 'd to put him out of the Parish , but would duck him a little first , and that would bring him to himself . The Deceased then seemed to be weary and weak , and was lying on his Back , and desired the Prisoner several times to let him alone . Counsel . Did you apprehend at that time that he was a sick or a dying Man ? Brett . No , he seemed to me to be weary and weak . I have known the Prisoner about 3 Years , and never heard that he did any Mischief to any Body before this Misfortune happened . Sarah Johnson . I know the Prisoner ; his name is George Johnson . One Saturday Night in May last , I was going along the Road at Hayes , and saw a little bustle in the Road . I went up , and found the Deceased and the Prisoner together . I asked him what was the matter , and he said , Here is a pilsering Rogue that has lurked about the Road ever since 3 o'Clock to rob somebody , and would not tell from whence he came , nor whither he was going , and if he would not speak , d - n him , he would throw him into the Pond . The Deceased made no answer to this , so the Prisoner took him up with his Knees bending under him and laid him along at a little distance . The Prisoner then said he was a pilsering Rogue , and he would have him out of the Parish for fear he should rob somebody in the Night . He took him by the Arm to the Angel Door , where he fell down on his Back , and I turned myself about , and thought I heard him cry Murder ! What happened after this I ca n't tell , but next morning , I heard that the Man was dead . Pris . Q . Did you see me do any Thing to him ? Johnson . No , he only endeavoured to help him along to get him out of the Parish , and did not misuse him . Frances Ashman . I saw the Prisoner drawing the Man along at Hayes . He had him under his Arm drawing him very easily along , and the Man desir 'd him to let him alone . I saw him the next morning when he was dead , but I did not examine him . Q . Did you see the Prisoner do any Thing to him that you think could be the occasion of his Death ? Ashman . No , I ca n't say I did . Mary Roberts . On Saturday the 23d of May , I was going out of my own House , and hearing a noise , I asked the Neighbours what was the matter , and was answered , they thought it was a drunken Man . In a little time I saw the Deceased lie prostrate on the Ground , and the Prisoner was pulling him up , and insisting on his going away . I said to the Prisoner , Coachman , let the Man alone , when he is come to himself he will go away ; and he replied , d - n it , this comes of listning to a parcel of foolish Women . The old Man then complained of his Legs , and the Prisoner still insisted on his going away , and if he did not he said he would throw him into the Pond . I did not hear the Deceased cry Murder , though I imagine he did by the Answer which the Prisoner made , for he said , Now you hear the old Rogue , he cries Murder . Counsel . Did you see the Deceased any Time afterwards ? Roberts . I saw him the next morning after he was dead . There was a Bruise on the top of his Head , and I saw no other marks except a few black and blue spots on his Legs , but how they came I ca n't tell , for I did not see the Prisoner offer any violence to him , only in pulling him up . Q . Do you think that Bruise which you saw on the Deceased 's Head , was the occasion of his Death ? Roberts . I ca n't say indeed . It was a Bruise , but it was not swelled , neither was the Skin broke . These Breeches and Garters are the same which the Deceased wore at that Time . John Pierce . I saw the Deceased when he was dead , about 5 o'Clock in the morning , and saw the Bruise on his Head ; and 2 or 3 spots on his Legs , but the Skin was not broke . Counsel . Do you think those were the occasion of his Death ? Pierce . I ca n't say ; - They might be the occasion of his Death for any Thing I know . John Dupree . I can swear to these Breeches and Garters ; they are the same that my Brother Eli Dupree wore when he left Gloucester . On the Tuesday morning before he was murdered , I sent him to London about some Worsted-Yarn . He was 75 Years of Age , and as quiet a Man as ever lived on the Ground , and as to his being drunk , he has not for these 32 Years last past drank any Liquor but what went in with a Spoon . Esther Sidey . I have known the Deceased 30 Years . On Thursday the 22d of May he came to my House in Cow Lane , and brought me a Letter to go to the King's-Head in the Old-Change to receive some Rent . He lay at my House that Night , and the next morning I rose at 5 o'Clock , and boiled him a quart of Milk for his Breakfast , which he eat up very heartily , and he said he was going directly for Gloucester , and hoped to be at Home by the Tuesday following . He was in perfect Health and had these very Breeches and Garters on when he left my House . As to his being in Liquor , I do n't believe he has drank any Thing but Milk these 30 Years . DEFENCE . Prisoner . I never saw the Man before in my Life , therefore I hope you will take it into Consideration that I had no spite or malice against him . Michael Gibbons . I keep the Red Lion Inn in Gray's-Inn Lane , and have known the Prisoner 12 Years ; I never heard that he was either a quarrelsom man , or addicted to drunkenness . Mintey Cook . I have known him 7 Years , and never knew him guilty of breaking the King 's Peace in my life , but always behaved well in all company . I never heard him give any abusesul ( abusive ) language ; neither do I think he would murder any Body , and I do n't know that ever he abused or desranded any of his Majesty 's Subjects whatsoever . Job Smith . I have known him 6 or 7 Years : I have been in his company a great many Times , and know that he would rather put up with an Injury than resent it . Robert Todd . I have known him some Years : He always was a very quiet honest man , and I never knew him guilty of a bad Action in my Life . Acquitted . 26 . 27 . 28.

The 2 other Prisoners were not there , but the Prisoner Crossley laid hold of me , and knocked me down .

I am positive he is one of them , and none of the other Prisoners were present except him . Edward White . John Crossley , Patrick Hagan , William Rowlins and I went out together with a design to rob on the 1st Wednesday in last November was twelvemonths . Crossley and I went up to this Woman in the Long Canseway in Holloway Road , and knocked her down . Hagan and Rawlins stood at a distance to watch while we robbed her , and as soon as we had done , they went to their lodging ; and Crossley and I went to Mr. Lewis 's Hay-Loft where we usually lay . Q . When you parted with the Prisoners did you meet again ? White . Yes , we parted the Booty the very same night . Q . Where did you divide it ? White . We divided it in the Road before we parted , and then Crossley and I went to Lewis 's Hay Lost , and the other 2 Prisoners went to Mr. Banister 's where they lodged . We broke the Loadstone which we took out of this Woman 's Pocket , and sold the Silver which belonged to it for 2 d. and shared it among us . Q . Was that and the Penny divided among you ? White . Yes , and there was about ten Pennyworth of Half-pence and we had all share and share alike . We likewise took a bunch of Keys , which we flung with the rest of the things into a pond . Perry . I do n't know that I had any Half pence at all about me at this time . Jury to White . What could you divide a piece out of that money ? White . We drank it out in liquor . Crossley . Where did you sell the silver which you took from the Loadstone ? White . We sold it for 2 d , at a Silversmith 's on London-Bridge . Crossley . Where did we drink the liquor ? White . We had it the next day at Banister 's at the Castle . Crossley . How much liquor had we ? White . We had about 2 or 3 full pots as near as I can guess . Q. to Perry . Is that man ( White ) like the person that attacked you ? Perry . No , he was a blackish complexioned man , and had a hollowness in his cheeks - I do n't believe White was one of them . Richard Lewis . I have known Crossley 20 years ; He was my servant , and I have entrusted him with a great many pounds , and he always was faithful and honest . I keep a public house , and he used to lie in my stables : I never saw any thing dishonest by him in my life . Jury . Have you ever seen him in company with the other prisoners ? Lewis . They have drank together at my house perhaps . Elizabeth Banister . Crossley lodged with me when he came from Lewis 's ; and then he worked in the brick fields for Mr. Graves . As to his general character I never heard but that it was a very good . Jury . Did you ever see Crossley drinking at your house with the other prisoners and White ? Banister . I ca n't remember to have seen them all together . John Holland . I have known Hagan these six years , and never knew that he desranded any body . James Whitefield . I have known Rawlins about 8 years . He lived with me , and he is very honest as far as I know , except on the account of his not paying his debts . All Acquitted . They were a 2d Time indicted for assaulting John Hall on the King 's Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him 4 s. in money ; Aug. 3 . They were a 3d Time indicted for breaking and entering the house of Joseph Goulding , no person being therein , and stealing a gold ring , 2 muslin stocks , and 2 pair of worsted stockings ; May 9 . They were a 4th Time indicted for stealing a wooden box and 5 l. 4 s. the money of Mary Hudson in the house of Ann Hazelhurst . Feb. 9 . And a 5th Time for breaking and entering the house of Philip Wicks and stealing a handkerchief , a pair of garters , a horn snuff-box , and 4 guineas ; May 7 . No evidence being offered to support the above Indictments , the prisoners were acquitted . They were a 6th Time indicted for that they not having God before their eyes , & c. on the 14th of September in the Parish of St. Mary Islington on Thomas Wall feloniously , & c. did make an assault , and with certain large sticks of the value of 1 d. each , feloniously , & c. most inhumanly and barbarously on the head and other parts of the body of him the said Wall did beat and strike , by means of which beating they the said Crossley , Rawlins and Hagan , did give to him the said Wall on his head , over his left eye , one mortal and confused wound whereby his skull was very much fractured ; of which from the said 14th of Sept. to the 10th of Oct. he languished and languishing lived , and then in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Less died . Joseph Lander . I am Beadle of Islington parish , and took the deceased Tho Wall in a cart to the hospital . He complained that he had lost a great deal of blood , but I did not view his wounds . Rachel Nelson . I am sister of the ward in which Tho Wall died . When he came to himself I asked him if he had any family ; he said he had 3 boys and a girl ; that he had been to pay for the nursing the girl , and coming back was met at Canbury-House by 3 men who beat him in a terrible manner , so that he could not see out of one of his eyes ; and after they had plundered him threw him into a ditch . Edward White . On the 14th of September last between 11 and 12 o'Clock , the prisoners and I met a man just by the Hole in the Wall near Canbury House at Islington . Crossley came up to him and stopped him , and he knocked Crossley down : I went up to Crossley 's assistance and he knocked me down . Then Hagan came before him and knocked him down , and kept beating him with a broomstick 'till we recovered ourselves , to rifle his pockets : Hagan swore we should kill him and then he would have no suspicion of us , so we put him into the ditch , and left him . Mr. Bigg , Surgeon . On the 15th of September the deceased was received into our Ward . He had a great number of contusions , and his head was beat almost to a Jelly . I ask 'd him if he had any retchings upon him , he said he was only sick and saint , and during this time he was perfectly sensible , and continued so for above 10 days . I asked him how this accident happened , and he said he had been to carry money to pay for his Child 's nursing , and was met by 4 or 5 men , 2 of whom he could have master 'd , had not the others come up and flung him into the ditch , for he was a very sturdy man , almost 6 foot high . At first I had great hopes of his life , for I could find no fissure in his skull ; but some time afterwards on enlarging the wound , found there was a necessity to trepan it . The membranes look 'd of a very bad colour underneath , and on laying them open farther , I found a fissure which ran quite under the temporal bone , and entirely divided the orbit of his eye , and he absolutely died of the wound which he received at that time . Jury to White . Are you positive the Prisoners were present at the commission of this murder ? White . Yes , we all went out with intent to rob . We have known one another 5 or 6 years , and followed labouring work ; sometimes we went out on this Lay , and sometimes got drunk and spent our money . Q . What places did you resort to together ? White . We lived as neighbours together at Holloway . Henry Priest . I have seen the 3 Prisoners and White together sometimes at one alehouse and sometimes at another . James Whitefield . I have seen White and the 3 Prisoners together several times , but I ca n't say they were all together at one time . Rawlins and Crossley were very conversant together , but as to any intimacy between Crossley and White I ca n't say . Robert Buckston . The evidence White was brought before Sir John Austen for a crime of a much less nature than any that he has charged the prisoners with , and he made this voluntary confession without any body 's pressing him to it that I know of . Elizabeth Banister . Rawlins came from gathering damsons at the Devil's-House , and went to bed very ill , at my house on the saturday before this fact was committed , and never got up till the tuesday following , at which time he was so weak that he could not walk a-cross the room without help . I desire Lander the Beadle may be asked if we did not send for him to take Rawlins to Hornsey work-house , for we were afraid we should be obliged to bury him . Lander . His mother came to us to beg relief for him , and I went to see him and found him ill , but I ca n't say what time it was . White . We used to drink at this woman 's house . Banister . They have been at my house , but I ca n't say , I ever saw them all there together . Mary Fish . I went to Mrs. Banister 's the monday after this murder was committed , and saw the prisoner Rawlins : He was very ill , and I helped to put his clothes on , and get him out of bed . Richard Lewis and Elizabeth Banister gave Crossley the character of an honest and industrious man . James Whitfield , took the Prisoner Rawlins to be an honest man . All acquitted . 29.

Ann Evans , Ann Hoskins , and Jervis Trueman , were indicted for assaulting Gerrard Cavenagh in the house of Jervis Trueman , putting him in fear , and taking from him a silver stock clasp , val . 5 s. a linen stock , val . 3 d. and 12 s. 6 d. the goods and money of the said Cavenagh , June 22 d . Gerrard Cavenagh . Last sunday was tennight at night , the Prisoner Evans met me in Fleet-street near Fleet-Ditch , and carried me to the Prisoner Trueman 's house . I followed the young jade up stairs ; she sat down in a chair and I sat by her , and Hoskins brought up a pint bottle of China Ale , I think they call it , for I never drank any of that liquor before . When we had taken that bottle between us 3 , we had another , and made an end of that in the same manner . Then this young jade asked me to go to bed with her , but she was battered and had a black eye , so I would not have any thing to say to her , but gave her 6 d. to be quiet , for I was sure she had a mind to do me a mischief . Presently she in the red cloak ( Hoskins ) came up ; I ask 'd her what was her demand ? she said a shilling ; but I thought 6 d. was enough , for those 2 pints did not hold above a pot : she said the common price of this house was 12 d. for 2 bottles and 6 d. for a bottle , so I got my hand into my pocket , and drew up a shilling , and said it was an extravagant house , for the liquor was worth nothing , and a pint of beer would be better than 5 bottles of it . I had clear 'd my way and was for going off , but this young jade ( Evans ) took hold of the skirt of my coat , and said she would not be quit of me : then the other Woman came up , took hold of my hair , while Evans took me by the body , and pick 'd my money out of my pocket . I immediately got hold of Evans , and Hoskins cut my fingers and my cheek with a knife to make me let her loose . After this they called that gentleman at the bar ( Trueman ) up , and he beat me in the face , and said he would murder me before I should leave the place . Then I lost my stock and clasp , but which of them took it I ca n't tell . They kept beating and battering me about some time , and at last I made my way to the door , leaving my hat and cane behind me , and met the drawer coming up , but I knock 'd him down stairs again . I cried out murder ! and a Watchman who was crying the hour within 3 yards of the door took me up to the watch-house , and afterwards secur 'd the Prisoners . Trueman . When you first saw me was you not on the stair-case , coming down to get away ? Cavenagh . No , I never saw him till he came into the room , and gave me a knock in the face . Robert Smith . I went to assist the watchman in carrying the Prisoners before a magistrate , and as we came back , Trueman drew this knife , and swore if I came near him he would cut me to pieces . After we came from Guild-hall , and got to the lodge at Newgate , Trueman flung a great piece of chalk at me and swore he would be revenged of me . Henry Gulston . I was going my rounds about 2 o'clock , and somebody in Trueman 's house called Watch ! I made up to the door , and the Prosecutor said he had lost 12 s. 6 d. his cane , hat , and clasp , and I took him to the watch-house . Trueman and the woman in the red cloak ( Hoskins ) who goes for his wife , were sitting at the door together at the same time , and said the man had lost nothing . Nicholas Stanley . I am a watchman : on the 21st of June about a quarter past 2 in the morning , I went to the watch-house to leave my lanthorn and staff , and the Prosecutor told me he had been robb 'd , and desir 'd I would assist him in taking the persons , and bringing them to justice . Accordingly I went down to the house . and found Trueman and Hoskins at the door . Hoskins immediately ran in doors , and on my going into the house to see for her , one George Coates told me she was gone out at the back door , but Trueman desir 'd her to come out , and then we secur 'd them . William Kingsley . I was constable for the night that this thing happen 'd , and hearing a Hurley-burley I sent the watchmen out to see what was the matter , and they brought the Prosecutor and three Prisoners to the watch-house . The Prosecutor seem 'd to be in a very bloody condition , and had a large cut across the back of his hand , and a bruise under one of his eyes . He charged the Prisoners with robbing him , so I thought it convenient to commit them to the Compter , and him to Bridewell , till the next morning ; when they were carried before the Alderman at Guild-hall . Daniel Hubbard . I am a watchman , and as I was coming with the constable from Bridewell , I saw Hoskins and Trueman standing at their own door , and when I got to the watch-house , the Prosecutor was there , and complained of this robbery . He said he had left his hat and came in the house , and I went there and found them all bloody behind the door . Prisoner Trueman . The Prosecutor brought 2 Women to my house while I was out , they went to fighting among themselves , and when I came home I went up to them ; the Prosecutor struck me in the face , and then I took to my own defence . Thomas Hooker . I was drinking last monday with the prosecutor and the prisoner Trueman 's brother at the Sun and Cart , and the prosecutor said he had nothing to say against Trueman for he did not come up stairs till after he lost his money . He said he saw the girl come down Fleetstreet , and she asked him to treat her with a pint of beer , and upon that he went with her to Trueman 's house at Fleet Ditch , where they drank a bottle of China Ale for which he paid a shilling . That he was going to be conversant with the girl , but catching her hand in his pocket , he gave her 6 d. for her trouble , and would not have any thing to say to her , for he thought it was enough for her to be a whore only and not a thief too . He said they battled together for about 10 or 12 minutes , and then Trueman came up and knocked him down backwards , at the same time swearing he would murder him . That after this another man came up and he lost his stock and clasp in the scuffle , but who took it he could not tell . This is all that I can remember , for his discourse was so imperfect , and his expressions so intricate , that a man must have the eloquence of Tully to express their meaning . William Trueman deposed to the same effect . William Mills . I have known Trueman from a child , and never heard but that he was an honest man till this misfortune happened . Samuel Sprig . I have known him upwards of 20 years : He bore a good character , and was always counted an honest man . Edward Lee . I have known him from a little boy . I took him to be an honest man and never heard any thing charged on him till this affair broke out . James Titsell . I have known him 24 or 25 years , and never heard that he was suspected of robbing any body . William Spencer . I have known him 15 or 16 years , and I never heard but that he bore a good character . Pris . Hoskins . I was Mr. Trueman 's bar-keeper ; and these people came into our house , and when they began to quarrel , I gave a young man three half-pence to call my master . Pris . Evans . I and another young woman met the prosecutor in Fleet-street ; and we went with him to Trueman 's house . We had a pint of ale for which he paid 3 d. and he gave me 3 d. for my company , and because I would not be great with him , he tore off my cloak , and stood at the bottom of the stairs , swearing he would kill the first man that came up . The drawer went up stairs and he did not meddle with him , but when the Gentleman ( Trueman ) offered to go up , he beat him over the fingers , and then fell upon us all . Nicholas Stanley again . The prosecutor sent for me to the constable 's house on Sunday , and the prisoner 's brother was present . He told Cavenagh he would satisfy him for his loss , provided it could be made up . Sam Tunmore . I heard Smith the watchman say , at the Running-Horse in St. John Street , that he wanted to speak to one of Mr. Trueman 's sons . One of them happening just then to go by , he ( Smith ) called him in , and told him he did not want to appear as an evidence against his brother , and desired to know what Mr. Trueman designed to do . Jury . We desire the constable may be asked what repute Trueman 's house is of . Kingsley . It bears a very indifferent character . Jury . Was the prosecutor sober when he came to the watch-house ? Kingsley . He was middling : He had been drinking but was not drunk . Hoskins and Evans guilty Felony , Trueman acquitted . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 37 . 38 . 39.

It appeared from the evidence that a box with the goods mentioned in the indictment , was put into Mr. Bidwell 's waggon in order be carried to Cambridge . That it was taken out of the waggon by the prisoner at Endfield , and part of the goods were found in his lodgings . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 57 . 58. Sarah Hilliard and Joice Topping were indicted for stealing six holland shirts , value 4 l. the Goods of Martin Stutevil , in the dwelling house of Wm Miller , March 22d . Wm Miller . I keep the White-Bear in Piccadilly . Sometime in March was twelvemonths these shirts were taken from my house . They were the property of Mr. Stutevil , and he sued me for them , and I paid him 4 l. 6 s. and 2 l. odd money to an Attorney for costs . Wm Hampton . Last March was twelvemonths I was drinking at Mr. Mill 's the Red Lion in Coventry-Court , and as I came from thence I met Edward Topping . He told me Elizabeth Fox who is executed , Joice Topping and Sarah Hilliard were gone to drink with a man at the White Bear in Piccadilly . I went down to the White-Bear , and the 3 women were at the door : They gave me a bundle which was just come out of the country , and the two prisoners went with me to Mills 's , but Fox and the man with whom they had been drinking went to the Brown Bear on the other side of the way . We drank a pint of beer at Mills 's and Topping tore part of the directions off , the Bundle , and burnt the rest , and then we agreed to go to Topping 's house in Rupert-street , and open it . We found in it 6 holland shirts , and I went with them to Mr. Grubb 's in Market-Lane , where they pawned 2 of them for 15 s. Then they gave me two , which I pawned at Mr. Hodges 's in Charles-street for 16 s. and gave them the money ; and in 2 or 3 days afterwards I carried the other two to Hodges 's , and had 15 s. for them , and gave them that money likewise . About a month after this I fell sick , and the 3 women quarrelled about the things , and when I got well , I challenged Hilliard with them , and she told me they were taken from the White-Bear . Thomas Day . I rented the tap of Mr. Miller ; and the prisoner Hilliard and another woman , who is either dead or hanged , came into our house with a tradesman of Reading and called for wine . I shewed them into the bar-room where they had 2 pints of wine , and as soon as they were gone , I missed this bundle . This parcel lay in the bar window , and I think the woman that is hanged sat down upon it : It was directed to Mr. Stutevil , and he brought his action against us for the loss of it . Jury . Was not Topping at the White Bear ? Day . No , there were only Hilliard and the woman that is dead . Pris . Hilliard . How came you to know my face so particularly , when you lost the things so long ago ? Day . I have seen you at your own house . Hilliard . Why did not you attack me then ? Day . Because I was not positive you stole it . Thomas Robinson . I am a chymist and having been serviceable to the Prisoner Hilliard and her husband in their illness , she came to me about twelve months ago , and told me she had some shirts in pawn , the benefit of which out of gratitude she would give to me . I went with her to Mr. Hodges 's and fetch 'd them out of pawn , and paid 16 or 18 s. for them . Hilliard . Hampton who is my husband pawned them himself , and he has done this out of jealousy and spite , for he stabb 'd me in the back , and I had 3 surgeons to attend me . Topping . I rented a house in Rupert-Street , and this Man and Woman lodged in my house 8 months and paid me nothing . Hampton . I did lodge in her house , and had 30 l. in my pocket when I came in , and spent it all in the house . Hilliard Guilty , 39 s. Topping Acquitted . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 59. Ann Hickman , alias Brogdan , was indicted for stealing a stock made of black horse hair , val . 2 d. and a silver clasp , val . 4 s. the goods of James Prior , June 6th . James Prior . The Prisoner met me near Rathbone Place , and clapp 'd her hand round my neck - Prisoner . Let that other man be turn 'd out , for my life is going to be sworn away for the sake of the reward . Prior . She clapp 'd her hand round my neck , and I immediately miss 'd my stock and clasp ; and a fellow giving me a tap on the shoulder she ran away . The man ask 'd me what business I had with his wife , and turn 'd me about , upon that I struck him a-cross the nose , and the blood ran over my shirt . I then call 'd watch ! and a watchman found her and the man arm in arm , and brought her to me directly . We then had her to the round-house , and the next morning we went before Colonel De Veil , who committed her to the gate-house ; and I am sure she is the person that came up to me and took my clasp from me . Prisoner . Ask him if he did not charge divers other persons with this fact ? Prior . No , I saw no other woman at that time but her . Jury . What time of the night was this fact committed ? Prior . It was the 6th of June , about a quarter after one in the morning . Prisoner . Was it light enough to discern one 's face ? Prior . I never lost fight of her , for she ran but a-cross the way and was taken . Abraham Collier . I was crying the hour and the Prosecutor complain 'd to me that he was robb 'd of his stock and clasp ; and a little girl coming up told me a woman and a man were just run across the way . I found the man and woman arm in arm behind a cart wheel , and I brought her to the Prosecutor , and on his saying she was the person , I took her to the round-house directly , and the next morning she was carried before Mr. De Veil . Prisoner . I know nothing of the affair , but I have house-keepers to prove that I did not leave the house in Rupert-Street till the watch went one , and he was calling for the watch at a quarter past twelve . Elizabeth Brooks . I believe it is a month next Friday ; I was going up Faulconbridge court , and met this gentleman Mr . Prior ; he was very much in liquor , and I believe it was 20 minutes past 12 at night . I never saw him before that night , and he wanted to give me a buss , but I said he should not . I met with him first at the 3 Compasses , which is just by the Duke of what d 'ye call him 's stables . He dragg 'd me as far as Soho Square and wanted me to earn 6 d. but I ran away to the pound in Hog-Lane . Then he came up to me again and catch 'd hold of me , and said , you B - ch , you have robbed me of a stock and stock-buckle ; I told him he lied , and call 'd the watch , and upon that he gave me a kick and sent me about my business . Jury . Was any body else by at the same time ? Brooks . Yes , I had a woman coming home with me and she is here . Jury . What time did you part with Prior ? Brooks . I believe it was about 20 minutes past tw elve . Elizabeth Plunkett . I was coming home with Elizabeth Brooks ; it was a month next Friday to the best of my knowledge , and about a quarter past 12 at night . This gentleman came up , and laid fast hold of Brooks and me too . He desired Brooks to go with him and he would give her 6 d. and when he found she would not , he said she had robb 'd him . She call 'd the watch , but none came to her assistance , and then he took her by the hand , and gave her a kick and sent her away . Mary Macguire . I live in Oxford Road and there is an alehouse next door to me . It will be a month next Friday , about a quarter past 12 , he came to the alehouse door , and said he was robb 'd of his stock and stock-buckle . I was a-bed and heard these words , and presently the Prisoner who is my lodger came to the door and I got up and let her in . After I had open 'd the door to her , she stood a little , and Prior came up to her and said , are you the woman that robb 'd me ? I desired him not to make a noise at the door , and he said he was a life-guard-man , and would pull the house down before morning . The Prisoner then went away for about a quarter of an hour , and Prior called the watchman , and charged him with my sister Elizabeth Lewin . Q. to Collier . Did Prior charge you with Elizabeth Lewin that night ? Collier . No , he did not . Q. to Macguire . Did you see Collier lay hold of the Prisoner ? Macguire . No , he went on the other side of the way , and brought her over . She did not lie in our house that night , but staid at the door because she heard the gentleman making a noise . Jacob Lewin . I am brother to the last witness . The Prisoner came to lodge in our house the night before this thing happen 'd , and the watchman was pleased to say she robb 'd the man in our house , whereof she did not . Margaret Bellamy . The Prisoner came to our house in Angel Court , Rupert-Street , and went away between 12 and 1 , I take it to be very near one by our clock , but she might get to the place where the robbery was committed before it was one by the clocks there .
