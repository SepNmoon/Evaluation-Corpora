T he reply 'd , my poor Dolly is dead , and I have a Body to look after me , and he rattled so in the Throat , that he said to him , I believe you are a dying , and by and by came in Mr. Shaw in Liquor , or the Liquor in him , and he called for a Pint of Drink and was so suddled , he could not hold it , but spilt great part of it with his shaking , and seeing Mr. Everet he said to him , you about begging for Work , you borrow 'd 30 Pounds to pay for your Wife 's Funeral , and 6 Pounds of it is unpaid yet .

He did not see Shaw strike the Deceased , but the Pot fell out of his Hand , and Shaw run against him , and he fell over the Fire , and he took him off , and they push 'd one at another ; that he said , why do n't you part them , and Mr. Shaw strove to come at Everet behind the Bench , but he was held , and Everet said , for God-sake , Mr. Shaw , do n't strike me , and he struck him no more ; that he saw Everet again at the same House , the same Night , with his Son , and he made no Complaint , but only said , did I give Mr. Shaw any Occasion or not .

An ADDRESS to the GENTLEMEN , By Dr. GREGORIUS , ( Noted for his Skill in Surgery and Anatomy , as well as Physick and Chymistry . ) WHO having observ 'd the frequent Advertisements in the News Papers , of one and another single Medicine , said to cure all sorts of Gleets , and Seminal Weaknesses , which their Authors confound together , as if there were no Difference between them , has been prevail 'd upon , by his Friends , in this publick Manner , to inform , and undeceive those who have unwarily been brought into either , ( or both together , as it sometimes happens ) of these perplexing , draining Imbecilities . That where the Gleeting is only from a Laxity of the Glands in the Urethra , what leaks and drills away insensibly from them , through the Urinary Passage , and spots or smears the Linen , though it be yellowish , vet being without Pain , or any ill-condition 'd Disorder , is no more than Mucus , and must be cured one Way . And where it is a Seminal Weakness , that which slips away involuntarily , though it be thin , watery , and unelaborate , either by itself , in the Day-time , or a Nights too frequently , or prosusely in the Sleep , or with the Urine , or upon Stool , whether from an Acrimony , or Depravity of the Juices , or by over-straining the Spermatick Vessels , or both , is Seed , and is to be remedied another way , inasmuch , as that Medicine which will cure the one , will not cure the other , and ( vice versa ) as every Practitioner that knows the Nature , Make , and different Situation of the Parts ministring to Generation , will allow ; and that for want of this due Distinction , and right Application , it is , that so many People are disappointed of Cure ; and by Continuance of the Gleetings , are drain 'd , as they are , into Impotencies , or Infertilities , which as it hinders their marrying , gives 'em great Anxiety , and the more , when attended , as in some , with Pain and Weakness in the Back and Reins ; or , as in others , with Difficulty , or Dribblings of the Urine in , or after making it , which at length comes away either foul , sharp , slimy , or of an ill Sell . As this is so in Fact , and the Dr. well known to have experienc 'd , in numberless Instances , the noble and never-failing Effects of two particular Balsamick Electuaries , which he spared no Pains or Expence to find out , the one to restrain the Mucus , and the other the involuntary shedding of the Seed , by their respectively bracing up the Fibres , and restoring the Tone and Springiness of the relaxed Glands and Seminals , invigotating the Genitals , and fertilizing the Seed , was also perswaded to recommend their Use , that those , who , for a long while together , had tried other Medicines for the same Weaknesses , and by their not succeeding , concluding themselves incurable , might be convinc 'd by their speedy Amendment and Recovery by these , that it was not the Incurability of their Malady , but the wrong Method they had been in for Cure . But yet in either of the said two Weaknesses , or where it happens that they are complicated , and have proceeded , either from Self-abuses , excessive , or over-straining Coitions , or from over Purgations in Venereal Cures , or any other Cause , as a Flux of Humours generally falls down and settles upon all weakened Parts , rendring them still the weaker , and these tender nervous Parts more especially : The first Step to be taken in order to make way for a regular and substantial Cure , ( and without which it is not to be accomplished ) must , in a peculiar Manner , be to correct , and gently divert those Humours ; and the only Medicine he could ever rely upon to do this effectually , that is , to overcome the Cause , and introduce the Cure of the most difficult of these Weaknesses , ( even where the Vessels had been obstructed , Manhood greatly enseebled , and in some , well nigh extinct , or at least not able to touch a Woman , but ad primum labiorum contactum , semen emittunt ; ) has been his Preparing Pills , of which when the Patient has taken only three Doses , at due Distances he is to begin ( and not before ) with one or t'other ( or both together , as the Case may chance to be ) of the said two Electuaries , which how to distinguish in , and how to proceed with , the printed Directions , wrap 'd up with the Pills , do so plainly shew , that no Persons , even of the meanest Capacities , can be at any Loss to understand them ; but will by their observing the easy Rules therein laid down , have their Blood and whole Body well cleans 'd and purified , the debilated Parts strengthened , and by Degrees , compleatly , and lastingly invigorated and restored , so as to be enabled quickly , and safely to Marry , without the least Need of any further , or other Advice or Medicine . They are to be had , Price 7 s. 6 d. the Box , sealed up , ready to be delivered to any Messenger , upon only asking for , a Box of Pills , at Mr. Payne 's , a Bookseller , at the Crown , facing the Chapter Coffee-House , in Pater-noster-row . Note , The said Electuaries , viz . Number 1 , for Gleets , and Numb . 2. for Seminal and Genital Weaknesses , are to had there also , Price 7 s. 6 d. each Pot , and are likewise sealed up , and to be asked for by Electuary Number 1 , or Electuary Number 2 . No . 162 . The Son of a certain Stationer having for some time been troubled with a Malignant SCURVY in his Limbs , and all over his Body , so that it differ 'd but very little from a LEPROSY , was brought by his Father , for Advice , to Mr. JOHN MOORE , Apothecary , At the Pestle and Mortar in Laurence-Pountney's-Lane , the first Great Gates on the Left-Hand from Cannon-Street . And he in about three Weeks time effectually cured him of all his foul Eruptions , to the great Satisfaction of all the Family . Any Person applying to the said JOHN MOORE , will be directed to the Patient himself , of whom they may receive the Particulars of this Cure more at large . N. B . The aforesaid JOHN MOORE has lately prepared two Anti-Scorbutick Medicines , being Pills and a Spirit , which excel any thing yet offer 'd to the Publick , with a Purge given at proper Times with it : It expels the numerous Trains of Scorbutick Symtoms ; and as the Hypocondriac and Hysteric Illnesses have their Source from the Scurvy it relieves them ; it altors and changes all the Juices in the human Body , renovates the Blood , restores decay 'd Nature , chears the Heart , revives the Spirits , and opens Obstructions of the Viscera , gives Rest to weary , tired and worn out Bodies , it invigorates and inkindles again the almost extinguish 'd natural innate Heat , making the Vital Flame to burn clear , removing Weaknesses and Indispositions , and restoring the prestine Health . The Symptoms are cutaneous Eruptions , as red , yellow or black Spots upon the Arm and Legs , as small as Flea-bites , sometimes as large a Crown-Piece , and sometimes the Limbs are beset with rough scaly Swellings , oftentimes there is an itching of the Skin , and is frequently taken for what is vulgarly call the Itch . The Scurvy perverts the Lympha , and is a mortal Enemy to the nervous System ; for Scorbutick Persons are troubled with Weariness , Weakness , Sonse of Weight , and a dull obscure Pain in the Limbs , the Appetite is either too stimulating or too languid , the Gums are liable to Excrescences , Swellings and Ulcers , and when rubb 'd void either a saltish Blood or serous Humor , the Teeth are loose and corroded , the Mouth has a Stench ; the Sp is very salt and sometimes acid , they are likewise affected with nocturnal Sweats , difficulty of Breathing , wandering Pains , a fat Skin is found sometimes swimming on the Top of the Urine ; but all these Symptoms are rarely found in the same Person .
