I missed my Mare out of Flower Field in Northamptonshire , about 4 o'Clock in the Morning , June 10 . I sought about for her , and was informed that she was gone up the Road , so I pursu 'd , and enquired at the Turnpikes , and of the People I met in the Road , if they had seen such a Mare , and I heard of her all the Way I went . At Highgate I overtook the Prisoner , and he had the Mare with him ; the People inform 'd me that he was on Horseback , and that my Mare was ty 'd to his Horse ; but when I took him he was on Foot , and was leading them both along the Road . I knew my Mare , - she was a young black Mare , with a long Tail , and a Star in her Forehead , - so I stopp 'd the Prisoner , and examin 'd him how he came by her , and I told him she was my Property ; he told me I must prove that ; but Company coming about us , I sent for a Constable , and took him before a Justice , there he said he had bought the Mare , and that she cost him 4l . The Justice advised him to send for the Man he bought it off , but he said he did not know his Name , nor any Thing about him . He was asked where he parted with this Man , and he said he left him at the Bell on Finchley-Common , but he would not let any one go there to enquire for him . Councel . Pris . Did not the Prisoner tell you that he bought this Mare upon the Road , of a Man that rode on a Bay Horse with a Star in his Forehead ? Shortland . He said the Man rode a brown Horse with a Blaze on his Forehead . Counc . Pris . Did any Body go to Finchley to enquire for this Man ? Shortland . No : No Body went as I know of . The Justice would have had him to have sent there , but he refused to send . Counc Pris . On enquiring after your Mare upon the Road , did any one tell you they saw a Man with a brown Horse , and a Blaze in his Forehead , leading such a Mare ? Shortland . No , they described this Man all the Way upon the Road ; I took my Mare from him , and 't is now in the Constable 's Hands at Highgate . Thomas Wills . I know the Mare is my Neighbour Shortland 's . A Witness . The Prisoner came to my House , which is in the Road , and is call 'd the Dirt-House , about a Mile and a half from Flower-Field , ( from whence the Mare was stolen ) and he told me , he was going to Litchfield . My House is in the main Road from Chester to London . Q . When was this ? When was the Prisoner at your House ? Witness . 'T was the 9th of June in the Evening , the same Night that the Mare was taken away . Shortland . And I missed her the next Morning , and I took the Prisoner the same Day . I hir 'd fresh Horses upon the Road and pursu 'd him , and took him that same Day . Q . Is Highgate from your House , - in the Way to Litchfield ? Is Highgate in the Way to Litchfield from your House ? Witness . He was at my House the 9th of June . He came in about 6 o'Clock in the Evening , he baited , and staid 2 Hours ; he told me he was going to Litchfield , and he went beyond my House into a Field , where ( I believe ) there was 60 Horses , and from whence ( I suppose ) he took this Mare , and he came back - he went past my House again . He went about 2 Mile beyond my House , as if he was going to Litchfield , but he came back again , and went past my House , the Way to Highgate . Defence . I bought this Mare coming along the Road , of a Man on a brown Horse with a bald Face . I desired them to go and find this Man at the Bell at Finchley . Shortland . I would have had the Prisoner to have sent to Finchley , but he would not , he never desired me to go there at all . Prisoner . I told them I bought the Mare upon the Road , of a middle aged Man , who rode on 2 brown Horse with a bald Face , and I told them I left him at the Bell at Finchley-Common . I desired them to go there and see if the Man was there or not . Shortland . He never desired me to send or go . Prisoner . While I was bargaining for the Mare there were 5 Men riding by , I knew them , and here are their Names . Shortland . He said before the Justice that no Body was by when the Bargain was made , - nor was any Person present when the Money was paid , and he never saw the Man he bought her off before that Time , nor did he know any Thing at all of him . William Raiment . I live at Barking in Essex . I am a Brewer there . The Prisoner kept a Publick House at Haveley in Essex , and during the Time he liv 'd there , he was a careful honest Fellow . I know nothing of his general Character , but his Behaviour with Regard to me was honest He is a silly innocent sort of a Fellow , and while he liv 'd there , the Management of the Business lay altogether upon the Wife . William Watts . I have nothing to say in Behalf of this Indictment , the Prisoner is my Tenant , and he lives in a Publick House belonging to me . I have known him 2 Years , and he bore the Character of an honest , harmless Fellow : he paid me 7 l. 10 s. a Year and several Times has paid me Money and took no Receipts . Guilty . Death . 5 , 6. Robert Gosswell , otherwise Bob the Butcher , and Robert Barrow , otherwise Run well , of St. George 's Bloomsbury , was indicted for assaulting James Christian in a certain open Place , near the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him an iron Key , value 1 d. a silk Purse value 6 d. five brass Medals , value 1 d. one Guinea , and six Shillings and Two-pence in Money , April 9 . James Christian . Last Easter-Eve , between 12 and 1 o'Clock at Night , I was coming thro ' Bloomsbury square , and three Men came up to me ; one of them clapp 'd a Pistol to my Breast , and the others demanded my Money , or ( they told me ) I was a dead Man . I was surprized , and said , - Gentlemen , do n't use me ill , - you shall have my Money , - do n't use me ill. One of them said , - No , - God forbid we should use you ill , - 't is Necessity makes us do this , and he immediately put his Hand into my Pocket , and took out a Guinea , some brass Medals , and about six or seven Shillings in Silver . I do n't know any of the Prisoners ; but I believe the Man that took the Money out of my Pocket , is this Man here , who has made himself an Evidence . He look 'd in my Face after he had done , - but I ca n't swear to him . One of the Prisoners . The Evidence , in his Information , said , there were three Queen Carolina 's , and three King George 's Medals ; ask the Prosecutor what Sort of Medals he lost . Christian . They were Queen Carolina 's and King George 's Medals ; such Things as the Children play with . James Wilson . 'T was Easter-Eve , or rather Easter-Sunday Morning , between 12 and 1 o'Clock , when we committed this Fact . The Prisoner Runwell held the Pistol to the Gentleman , and Goswell came up and pull 'd of his Hat to him , and told him , he must rifle him . Q . What was taken from the Prosecutor ? Wilson . One Guinea , and six Shillings and Two-pence : The Two-pence we spent in Gin , and the Guinea we divided between Runwell and myself : Gosswell had only his Part of the six Shillings , and Part of the Two penn ' worth of Gin , - we had a whole half Pint for the Two-pence . Runwell and I had 12 s. 6 d. a piece , that is , - two Shillings out of the six , and half a Guinea a piece out of the Guinea ; for we sunk upon Gosswell , he did not know that we got the Guinea . When we took the Medals from the Gentleman , we thought they had been Guineas , and we went to an Alehouse , in Well-street , near Salt-Petre Bank , to see whether they were Guineas or not . Q . Did you all go out on this Design together ? Wilson . Runwell and I agreed to go out upon this Affair together , and as we were going along , we met Gosswell , and he agreed to go with us : So we all three went together , and meeting the Prosecutor , - There 's your Mark , says I , and immediately Runwell clapp 'd his Pistol to his Breast , but there was neither Powder nor Ball in it . Gosswell . This Man has been an Evidence before : he was three Days together at the Thief-taker 's House . They took me several Times to an Alehouse , and would have persuaded me to have been an Evidence against Wilson , and as we had no Money , they lent me a Shilling , and Wilson a Shilling . I told them that I never saw the Evidence 'till I came from Hampstead Races , and that I knew nothing of him . William James and Brock , would have given me Money to have done it , but I knew no more of the Evidence than the Child unborn . Runwell . The Evidence and I fell out at a House where we went to drink , and the young Man that was with him , asked me to go out with them , but I refused , and went Home , upon which the Evidence came to the Place where I live , in Well-Street , and fir 'd off his Pistol before the Door . Mr. Justice Poulson . He came before me , and made himself a voluntary Evidence , and the Account he now gives , is intirely consistent with that he gave before me . Both Guilty . Death . 7. Martin Wright , of St. Paul 's Covent Garden , was indicted for stealing eight Guineas , the Property of Roger Applegarth , in his Dwelling-house , June 4 . Roger Applegarth . On the 28th of May last , I went into the Country , and left my Servant ( Martin Wright ) in my Chambers in New-Inn . I had lock'd-up eight Guineas in my Scrutore , before I went from Home , and when I return 'd , the Prisoner met me at the Door , and said , the Back of the Scrutore had been broke open . I asked him how it came : He told me he did not know ; but in the Afternoon , when I examined him again , before two Gentlemen who are here , he confess 'd he did it himself ; that he broke it open the Night I left the Town , and took out three Guineas at that Time : On the Thursday following , he took out the other five . I asked him what he had done with the Money ? He told me , he had laid out some of it in Cloaths ; some of it he had spent , and thirty Shillings of it he had left in one Mrs. Wilkinson 's Hands . I went next Morning to Mr. Wilkinson 's , and he said , he knew nothing of the Matter , but he would inquire of his Wife about it ; and the next Day he brought me 22 s. 6 d. and told me , his Wife had laid out the rest of the Money for the Prisoner 's Use . Prisoner . Ask my Master if he found any thing upon me ? C. He does not say he did : He says , you own 'd the Fact . Prisoner . If I did own it , it was unknown to me : They threaten 'd my Life , and gave me Money to own it . A Witness I was at Mr. Applegarth 's Chambers on Saturday the 4th of June , and he accused his Footboy of breaking his Scrutore , and taking out eight Guineas . After he had been examined , he confess 'd , that he broke the Scrutore on the Saturday before , and took out three Guineas , and on the Friday following , he took out the other five He was asked , what he broke it open with : And he told us , he did it with the Pin that fasten 'd the Window shutters The greatest Part of the Money , he said , he had spent ; thirty Shillings he had laid out in Cloths ; half a Guinea he had spent that Day Se'snight in Drink , and in treating his Companions , and a Guinea , he said , he had lodged in the Hands of Mr. Wilkinson . I asked him if there was any more there ? And I think he said , there was some little Matter more there He was as fresh and sober , when he gave this Account , as he is now . Prisoner . They will take my Life away , if it be possible , tho ' I know nothing at all of it . The 30 s. that Mrs Wilkinson had , was Money I had sav'd-up , and had given her to keep for me . A Witness . He fell on his Knees , and asked Pardon : He said , if his Master would forgive him , he would never do so any more , but would be a very faithful Servant for the future . Mary Wilkinson . The Prisoner gave me the Money to keep for him , 'till I had Opportunity to lay it out in Linnen for Shirts . He did not tell me how he came by it ; he only desired me to keep it for him , lest he should spend it . Q . When did he leave this Money with you ? Mary Wilkinson . 'T was the 1st of June , as near as I can guess ; I never heard any Thing ill of him in my Life . Matthew Sloper . The Prisoner at the Bar was my Servant and Mr. Applegarth 's . On the 28th of May , Mr. Applegarth went into the Country , and I went out to spend the Evening . When I came Home , I found his Scrutore was removed , about a Foot from the Wainscot , and the Back of it was broke open . I look 'd about the Room , to see if any Thing was missing ; I saw nothing gone , unless 't was any Thing out of the Bureau . When Mr. Applegarth return 'd , I told him his Bureau had been broke , and he tax 'd the Prisoner with it , and he confess 'd he took the Money . He said , he broke open the Bureau , and took out three Guineas , the Saturday his Master went out of Town ; and on the Thursday following , he took out five more . He own 'd he did it with the Pin of the Window , and he fell upon his Knees and begg 'd Pardon ; he said , it was the first Fact that he was ever guilty off , and if he would forgive him , he would serve us honesty and faithfull for the future . I am in Chambers with Mrs. Applegarth , and the Prisoner was our Servant . Prisoner 's Defence Thomas Eames . I keep an Academy by Red-lion-Square , and am Vestry-Clark of St. George the Maryr . I employed the Prisoner before he came to these Gentlemen , and since he had been with them likewise . I have left him to take Care of my House , with a great Charge ; I have entrusted him for some Years , and within these two Months , but never miss 'd any Thing : I have known him from a Child , and that was the Reason I confided in him in this Manner . John Shorey . The Prisoner is my Kinsman : I have known him from his Infancy : He is as honest a Lad as any can be . He never wronged Man , Woman or Child of a Farthing in the World , to my Knowledge . Others were in the Chambers , and had the Keys , and I believe him Innocent . Thomas Hall . I have known the Prisoner between two and three Years : He always behaved in a sober , civil Manner . I never saw him Master of above a Shilling in my Life . Guilty . Death . 8. John Purdey , of St. Mary le-bone , was indicted ( with Robert Meredith , not taken ) for assaulting Emanuel Slater , in a certain open Field near the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a cloth Coat , value 10 s. 6 d a Pair of brass Buckles , value 2 d. a Pair of leather Gloves , value 2 d. May 29 . Emanuel Slater . I was coming from Tottenham High-Cross , into the Town , and had bought a twelve-penny Loaf , and eight-penn'worth of Cheese . This was on Whitsunday in the Afternoon : So I sat myself down to eat some of my Bread and Cheese , and two Fellows came up to me , and asked me , where my Place of Abode was ? I told them , at Tottenham Then they asked me what Business I follow 'd , and what I got a Day ? I said , I work 'd at Hay-making , and earned 14 d a Day . They told me , if I would go with them , they would help me to a Master that would give me two Shillings , and they said , they were my Countrymen . Then they asked me for some of my Bread and Cheese ; I gave them some , and they thank 'd me . After this , they said , they would go to a Master of theirs , who ow 'd them fifteen Shillings , and see if they could get any Money from him , and they pretended they would treat me . I told them I had no Money , and desired they would not make me drunk , so they had me to the Prisoner in a Cellar at the Seven-dials , and after they had spent all my Bread and Cheese , they desired me to go with them to their Abode at Marybone ; it should cost me nothing , and I should go to work with them the next Morning . Upon this , I went with them into Marybone-fields , and there they laid Violence upon me . I said , pray do n't make a Hand of me , - I have nothing for you now : But they damn 'd me , and bid me not say a Word , - if I did , they would knock me on the Head . Q . What did they take from you ? Slater The Prisoner threw me down , and stripp 'd ( with Violence ) the Coat off my Back , and they took my Buckles , and a Pair of Gloves from me . I count the Buckles were Brass , - they were wash 'd over . Q . How was the Prisoner taken ? Slater . After they had robb 'd me , I enquired my way back to the Seven Dials , and I li't of a Friend and told him my Story . He bid me be easy , and said he would direct me to them ; they are villainous Fellows says he , and they live by cheating young People ; so he help 'd me to a Man that lives at St. Giles 's Pound , who took up the Prisoner on Suspicion , and had him before Justice De Veil , and I swore to my Coat and to the Man . Q . What did the Prisoner say , when he was before the Justice ? Slater . Why he told him that I pull 'd off my Coat , my self ; and that I gave it to them to pawn , and the Justice said , - how could he pull it off to pawn in Marybone Fields ? there 's no Pawnbroker there ; - there 's no Pawnbroker in Marybone Fields , - these were his very Words , so the Justice committed him to a Place of Abode 'till next Day , and then the Pawnbroker was brought in , - I do n't know his Name , but he 's here in Court now . Prisoner . I never was nigh him ; I was in a Gin-Cellar at the Seven Dials , and two Bricklayers who had pick 'd him up brought him there to me . The Pawnbroker . The Prisoner at the Bar brought me this Coat ; I ask 'd him if 't was his own ? Do you question me say 'd he , - 't is not my own , - 't is my Brother 's ; he is lately come from Exeter , and is in distress for a little Money ; but we must have it again , ( says he ) in two or three Hours , therefore do n't put it out of the way . I did not mistrust the Prisoner , if I had , I would have secur 'd him . The Coat lay but a Day in my Hands , they came with the Prosecutor to ask for the Coat and I shew 'd it them directly , and carried it to Justice De Veil 's . - I never loved to detain any Thing , - that 's base , - I have not liv 'd fifty Years in the Parish of St. Martin 's to do that . - This is the very Coat the Prisoner brought to me . Slater This is the very Coat the Prisoner took from me . Prisoner . Two Bricklayers pick 'd him up by Newington , or Shoreditch , and brought him to me ; and one of them gave me his Coat to pawn . They drank thirty Quarterns of Gin , and were all drunk . The Prosecutor pawn 'd his Bread and Cheese , and the Bricklayer 's pawn 'd their Tools . The Thief-takers at St. Giles 's Pound , have had him in Hand ever since , and have tutor 'd him to swear my Life away . A Keeper . Mr. Goddard and another Person has been 2 or 3 Times in the Gatehouse to see the Boy ( the Prosecutor ) and they had some Talk with him , but I do n't know what it was about . Guilty . Death . 9. John Richardson , was indicted ( with John Lovell , not taken ) for assaulting John Cuttings , on the King 's Highway , in the Parish of St. Mary Whitechappel , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Hat , value 5 s. April 28 . John Cuttings . On the 23d of April , between 3 or 4 o'Clock in the Morning , I was attack 'd in Goodman 's fields , by three Men . One of them took fast hold of my Collar , and clapp 'd something to my Breast , and cry 'd - d - mn your Blood , you 're a dead Man . I immediately struck him a Blow under his left Jaw , which beat him from me ; but I lost my Hat , and Wilson the Evidence says , that he ( himself ) was the Man that took it from me . I cry 'd out , Fire , - Fire - Thieves - Thieves , and follow 'd them down the back Street , but there was no body to stop them : so gave over the Pursuit . I know none of them : I can not swear to the Prisoner ; I only can say , I lost my Hat , and a small Stick I had in my Hand . James Wilson . On the 23d of April in the Morning , the Prisoner and I , and Lovell committed this Robbery : We had been walking all Night , and could meet with nothing to the Purpose , but about 3 o'Clock we stopp 'd Mr. Cuttings . I clapp 'd my Pistol to his Breast , gave him a Blow and collar 'd him . He resisted , but I twitched his Stick out of his Hand , and said , it was very hard to stop a Man and rob him of nothing but a Stick , so I took his Hat off , and left him my own . Then he cry 'd out , Fire , - Thieves , and we were all obliged to run off . The Hat is here in Court , but I ca n't take upon me to swear 't is the same I took from Cuttings , because the Lining and the Loops are gone . We got a Woman to sell the Hat for us , and she happen 'd into a Shop were Cuttings was telling of the Robbery ; so she came back again with it , and would have nothing to do in the Affair . Then I gave it to a Woman I live with sometimes , and she sold it for us to Irish Peg ; we were all equally concerned , and the Money was divided among us . They all assisted in the Robbery , and were all up with him as well as I. Prisoner . I never saw him in my Life , before Mr Harris the Thief-taker took me up . Wilson . We have been several Times in Company together : Here 's a Gentleman that saw the Prisoner and I together the Morning after Cuttings was robb 'd . John Kisby . The other Woman had the Hat in her Lap to sell , but she returned with it frighted , and deliver 'd it again to Wilson , telling him she would have nothing to do with it , and that she had heard a Gentleman talk about his being robb 'd of a Hat , therefore she would not be concerned : So Wilson took it from her , and deliver 'd it to a Woman with a blind Eye . I have seen the Prisoner drinking with this very Man . ( Wilson ) Q . Have you seen them together before or after the Robbery ? Kisby . I believe it was after . Q . Have you seen them more than once together ? Kisby . I think I have ; but how many Times I can not tell . Q . ( To Cuttings . ) Is that your Hat ? Do you know it again ? Cuttings . 'T is like my Hat , but I ca n't swear to it now : They have taken the Lining out , and cut the Loops off . I described it , all through Rosemary-lane and Rag-fair , and I understand the Woman that first had the Hat to Sell , came into one of the Shops where I was telling the People about it . Harris , Constable . I took the Prisoner and carried him before Justice Poulson , there he own 'd he saw Lovell and Wilson stop Mr. Cuttings ; he said , he went up to them , and told them , 't was a barbarous Thing to use a Gentleman in that Manner they used him . Prisoner . That Harris swears my Life away for the Sake of the Reward . Guilty .

I have seen the Prisoner write , and I believe the Name at the Bottom of this Re-ceipt is her Hand-writing . I have had Dealings with her these 9 Years , and on my Oath I believe she wrote that Name . Read the Receipt. `` Received the 14th of October 1736. per me `` Catherine Leng , the Sum of 25 l 14 s being in `` full for Wages , Debts , and all Demands , for `` Service perform 'd on Board the Ship Prince `` Augustus , Captain Francis Gosling Commander , `` by Joseph Bulleton per me , ( to whom I am Executrix ) `` Catherine Leng Q . Do you know what was due to Bulleton when the Ship came Home ? Fleet . This was the Ballance of his Account , for Service on Board the said Ship 19 l 4 s. 9 d. there was 25 l. 14 s. due for Service , but upon the Ballance , she received neat Money 19 l 4 s. 9 d. Bulleton . When I return 'd Home in the Prince Augustus , I was press 'd on Board the Britannia Man of War in Sir John Norris 's Fleet , which was then going out for Lisbon : I was carried to Spithead , and there the Prisoner came to me , and asked me for a Power to receive my Wages . I denied to make her a Power , and she offered me 2 Guineas to do it ; but I knew her Character , and would not consent , for she had used me ill before this , and the People assured me she was a bad Woman , and they bid me take Care of my self . I have Witness that she went angry away from me because I would not consent . Q . Did her Husband apply to you for such a Power ? Bulleton . No , only she . She only asked me to make her a Power ; I do n't remember a Word about a Will , nor did I hear any Thing of her having received my Money , till I came Home in the Britannia from Lisbon . Prisoner . Why Joseph Bulleton , - when I heard of your Arrival , I was not confirmed of your Life , - 'till my Son Charles saw you at Sheerness , and then I bid him tell you I had received your Wages , and what Ballance was between us , I would pay you , and I desired you to come Home , and I would make all Things easy ; I bid him tell you , that altho ' it was not in my Power to pay you , I would give you a Note of my Hand for the Money . When you came up , I told you I was glad to see you , but I was sorry in another Respect , for thro ' Information of your Death , I had administer 'd for you ; you told me I had done a base Action , and I said , I did it with no ill Intent , and I wished they had been dead that gave me Intelligence of your Death , and I told you farther , that whatever was due to you , when my Husband came Home , you should be paid with all the Pleasure in Life . Call Mark Weyland , for he was to sign this very Will , but only he could not write . Mark Weyland . I know nothing of this Will : I made her a Power my self , - one of the same sort , but I can say nothing to this . Q . Do you know that Bulleton made a Will in her Favour ? Weyland . I saw him once writing there , but I ca n't swear to this Paper . - I can neither read nor write . C. You are charged with receiving 19 l. 4 s. 6 d due to Bulleton , of John Spencer , upon a Will which you knew was forged : Can you call any Witnesses to induce a Belief , that you did not know it was forged ; or that it was a true Will : Prisoner I had no Occasion to forge a Will of Bulleton 's , because when I heard of his Death , I could have administer 'd as chief Creditor . Grace Farrell . I came to the Prisoner 's House to work for her , and I saw some Papers lying there , and I asked her what they were , and she told me they were Wills ; at the same Time she told me , I must not expect the Box which the young Man had promised to send me from Lisbon , for he was dead . I know nothing of this Will . Councel . To put the Matter out of all Doubt , here 's a Man will prove the Body of the Will is filled up , with her own Hand-writing . Mr. Lewis . I have seen a great deal of her Writing , - ( looking on the Will ) I verily believe the whole filling up is by her own Hand . Prisoner . Consider my Life 's at Stake . I am a Foreigner ; here 's 4 more Wills , could I forge all these 4 Wills too ? Lewis . I believe the whole of this to be her own Writing except this Name , ( Williamson ) . Prisoner . Look at the rest of them for Christ 's Sake . Examine these Wills . Lewis . I have look 'd over this Will very carefully , and I take it to be filled up by her self . The Mark of Joseph Bulleton , that too is her own Writing . Jury . Did Bulleton owe her any Money when he went to Lisbon ? Bulleton . Before I went to India I owed her 3 l. 5 s. and I gave her a Note of my Hand for the Money : After that she got 4 l. 12 s. of my Wages , so when I came Home , she owed me Money . She received 4 l. 12 s. while I was in India , for the 3 l. 5 s. so I thought she was very well paid . After she had received this 3 l. 5 s. I never ow 'd her a Farthing . Councel . ( To Lewis ) Look on these other Wills , Do you think they are fill 'd up with her Handwriting . Lewis . Here 's the Power by which she receiv 'd the 4 l. 12 s. the Power and the Will I believe to be both wrote by the same Hand . Guilty . Death . 11. John Bailey , of the Tower of London , was indicted for assaulting William Burton , with a drawn Sword made of Iron and Steel , which he held in his right Hand , and giving him the said Burton on the right Part of the Belly under the right Ribs , a mortal Wound of the Breadth of half an Inch , and the Depth of 6 Inches , June 20 , by Reason of which , he languished , and languishingly lived , from the said 20th to the 21st of the said Month and then died . He was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . John Waterman . The Night this happen 'd I was in Bed in the Barracks , and after the Tattoo was gone by , the Deceased as Serjeant of the Night , came in his Office , to call over the Rolls , in order to see who was absent . When he came to one Darby 's Bed , he found him missing , and said he would return him . The Prisoner told the Deceased he should not return him ; the Deceased said he would : the Prisoner said he would lay him a Shilling he dar 'd not return him ; the Deceased replied , G - d sink me if I do n't : the Prisoner repeated - that he dar 'd not ; the Deceased d - mned his own Blood if he did not return him just then , and he immediately laid down his Paper and began to write , in order to return Darby . When he had done it , he commanded the Prisoner to go to Bed ; he told him he would not ; upon this the Deceased blew the Candle out , and went into the next Barrack to call over his Roll there . Then he returned with a Candle into this Barrack again , and went to Bed , having first put out the Candle . The Prisoner lay in a little Apartment that is enclosed , and taken out of the Barracks for the Use of the Colonel , and the Deceased lay in a Bed that joined close to it . After the Deceased was in Bed , the Prisoner told him he wou 'd do for him next Morning ; and the Deceased said he did not value him , he could do well enough for himself . Then the Prisoner call 'd him a Black-guard , scrubby Fellow , and the other told the Prisoner he was a saucy , ragged , Country Fellow , and came up to the Army without a Shirt on his Back ; upon which the Prisoner called the Deceased a Blackguard scandalous Rascal ; the Deceased then said , - if you call me so again I 'll get up and pull down your Barrack Door and lick you . The Prisoner called him the same Names again and again directly ; so the Deceased jumped out of Bed , and went into the next Barrack to fetch a Candle , and he came with it immediately to the Prisoner 's Door , and taking hold on the Top he gave it a Shake . Whether he pulled it open , or whether the Prisoner open 'd it himself I can not tell , but the Prisoner had his Hand on the upper Bar of the Door ; when the Door open 'd , I saw both their Hands on it , and it had not open 'd above 18 Inches before the Prisoner gave his Sword ( which was drawn in his Hand ) a Twirl round , and presented it into the other 's Body , thro ' the right Part of his Belly . I can say nothing farther , the other Witnesses will give a better Account of it . Prisoner . Did not I tell the Deceased that Darby had thrown up his Pay ? Waterman . Yes , and you told him he had Leave to be absent . Prisoner . When I told the Deceased I would not go to Bed , did not he strike me over the Face , and beat the Pipe out of my Mouth ? Waterman . No , the Deceased was not within 5 Yards of the Prisoner . Prisoner . Did not I go to Bed before the Deceased , and make my Door fast ? Waterman . He went into his Room , but whether he went into Bed , or fasten 'd the Door , I can not tell . Q . Did the Deceased attempt to force open the Door ? Waterman . He took Hold on the Top of the Door and shook it : I think if he had pulled the Door , with half his Strength he might have broken it to Pieces . Q . Was this Apartment separated from the rest of the Barracks . Waterman . Yes , it was divided from them by a Partition of Boards . 'T is a little Place about 9 Feet long , - or not so much , and 7 Foot over : the Prisoner 's Bed was in this Place . The Colonel puts his Goods in it , and the Prisoner has lain in it ever since I have been in the Company , and I commenced the 6th of May last . I 'm but a young Soldier . Counc . Do you remember what Corporal Lindsey said upon this Quarrel ? Waterman . No , I do not . I know he was never out of his Bed 'till the Deceased was kill 'd . Counc . Has the Prisoner any particular Service under the Colonel , distinct from that of a Soldier ? Waterman . He was Paymaster Serjeant : there 's one Paymaster Serjeant in each Company , and he pays the Company he belongs to . The Prisoner and the Deceased were both Serjeant s. Counc . Had one a Command over the other ? Waterman . The Deceased in his Office had the Command over the other , and over every one that belonged to that Company . Q . Had the Deceased any Weapon in his Hand , when he came to the Door ? Waterman . No , nothing but the Candle and Candlestick . Anthony Sharp . On Monday Night , the 20th of June , the Deceased came into the Barrack I belonged to , and fetched away the Candle in a Hurry ; he was naked , and without Shooes or Stockings . I follow 'd him into the other Barrack , and saw him clap his Hand on the Top of the Prisoner 's Door , I can not be positive whether he or the Prisoner open 'd it ; but the Door open 'd and I saw a Hand and a Sword come out ( before the Door was full open ) with a full Push , and the Deceased was thrust into the right Side of the Body . I ca n't say I saw any more of the Prisoner than his Hand . C. What was the Consequence of that Push ? Sharp . The Deceased clapp 'd his Hands here ( on his Belly ) and immediately stagger 'd . He died the next Day between 12 and 1 o'Clock . Prisoner . Did you see my Hand on the Door ? Sharp . I ca n't tell that I did . Counc . How far from the Door was the Deceased when he received the Wound ? Sharp . I believe he might be half a Yard from the Door . Councel . Had the Deceased any Command , or Power over his Brother Serjeant ? Sharp . Yes , he had : He was to see us all in Bed , and that all the Candles were put out . Councel . Had he Power to command the Prisoner to open the Door ? Sharp . Not as I know of . Councel . Supposing the Prisoner had insulted the Deceased , or had given him provoking Language , had he Power to correct him with Blows ? Sharp . He had Power to take him Prisoner , according to Military Law , and to have sent him to the main Guard . Q . If the Prisoner had had a Candle there , had the Deceased a Power to have gone there to have searched ? Sharp . He is authorised and obliged to put out all the Lights , after the Tattoo has gone about . Prisoner . Had I a Candle in my Room ? Sharp . I ca n't tell . Waterman . I believe there was no other Candle , than that which the Deceased had in his Hand . Richard Toombes . The Deceased and I had been out that Afternoon , drinking at a Friend 's House : We came in about 10 o'Clock , and he did his Business and call 'd over the Roll One Darby was absent , and the Prisoner said , he had leave to be absent . The Deceased said , he would return him , and the Quarrel began , as the first Witness has mention 'd . After many Words , the Deceased put the Candle out , and went to call over the Roll in the other Barrack : When he had done , he returned to his own Barrack , and undrest himself and went to Bed . The Prisoner in his Room , still abused him , and the Deceased said , he would get up and lick him for abusing him : And accordingly , our Candle being out , he got up and fetch 'd one from the next Barrack , and coming to the Prisoner 's Door , he took hold of it and shook it ; the Door was open 'd , I know not how , nor by who ; but when 't was about a Foot and a half open , the Prisoner thrust out his Hand , with his drawn Sword , and stabb 'd him immediately . As soon as he had done it , he shut the Door again , and fasten 'd it in half a Minute 's Time . 'T was fasten 'd on the Inside , for Corporal Thomas was forced to fix a Bayonet on a Piece and break the Door open to take the Prisoner Prisoner . Ask him if he did not see the Deceased strike me , and break my Pipe , before I went to Bed ? Toombes No ; there was no Pipe broke , nor any Blow struck on either Side . The Push with the Sword was all . Prisoner . When I was taken , that Man went dancing and singing all the Way before me , and said , he had an Opportunity now to be revenged : And he would swear his Soul to the Devil but I should be hanged . Q . Have you ever express 'd any Ill-will to the Prisoner ? Toombes . I never used any such Expressions , nor have I any Ill-will to the Man . I borrow 'd Money of him but two Days before , and have often drank with him ; the whole Company knows it . Q . Did any Words pass between the Prisoner and the Deceased at the Door , before it was open 'd ? Toombes . I heard none . Christopher Smith . When the Deceased was in Bed , many Words passed : The Prisoner call 'd the other Black-guard , Scoundrel and Rascal . The Deceased said , do n't call me so , if you do , I will get up and lick you . You dare not , says the Prisoner , I have got something will keep you from it The Prisoner was then in his Apartment . Q . Are you sure the Prisoner said he had something would keep him from it ? Smith . Yes ; I am sure of that . Then the Deceased ran to the other Barrack , and fetch 'd a Candle . He shook the Door , and it open 'd ; but I can not say which of them open 'd it . Then the Prisoner gave a Push with his Sword , under his own left Arm ( for his left Hand was upon the Door ; ) no sooner was the Sword pushed out , but the Door was made fast , and the Corporal was forced to break it open to take him . Prisoner . Ask him if he did not see the Deceased break my Pipe ? Smith . No : I saw that Corporal that stands there , break his Pipe . Q . How long after the Door open 'd was it , that the Push was given ? Smith . The Push was given and the Door was fasten 'd again , in less than a Minute . 'T was given immediately , and immediately the Door was shut , and made fast on the Inside . Q . Was there Time after the Opening of the Door , for the Prisoner to draw his Sword ? Smith . No : There was no Time to draw his Sword , it must have been drawn before the Door was open 'd . Councel . What is the Prisoner 's general Character ? Smith . Since I have known the Company , he has not had an extraordinary Character . He very frequently disturbed the Barracks in the Night . Councel . Who do you speak of ; the Prisoner or the Deceased ? Smith . The Prisoner there at the Bar . Mr. Ellis , Surgeon . The Day after the Deceased dy 'd , I examined the Body . I found the Instrument had penetrated the right Side of the Belly obliquely thro ' the Back . The Wound was downwards , and went quite thro ' the Back , and to be sure was the Occasion of his Death . John Urqubart . The Quarrel began as hath been related , and after many abusive Speeches , the Prisoner and the Deceased went to their Beds . After they were both in Bed , the Prisoner aggravated the Deceased , and call 'd him old rascally Scoundrel , and the Deceased said , if he abused him so , he would get up and lick him . The Prisoner continuing to abuse him , he got up , and went to the other Barrack for a Candle , and when he came back with the Candle , he pull 'd once or twice at the Prisoner 's Door , and it open 'd ; but who open 'd it I can not tell . Immediately upon the Opening the Door , I saw his Hand push the Sword into the Deceased 's Body , he stagger 'd and clapp 'd his Hands upon his Belly . I was partly behind the Door , so I could not see whether the Prisoner had his Hand upon the Door , or not . I saw no Blows before this , nor did I see the Pipe struck out of the Prisoner 's Mouth . John Thomas , Corporal . I was in the other Barrack when the Deceased came to fetch the Candle . I got up and went after him , and when I got into his Barrack , I saw him stooping as if he was wounded . I was very much flustrated ( or very much surprized ) so I ran to a Rack , and took down a Piece , and ( I believe ) I broke open the Door and took him the Prisoner . Q . How long had the Prisoner lodged there ? Thomas . We have been eight Months at the Tower , and he has lain there all the Time . I think he purchased it . 'T is a particular Bed ; enclosed with a Partition : The Bed belongs to the King , or the Barrack Master . Q . Has the Serjeant that is in Office for the Night , any Right , for the Sake of preserving Good Order , to go into that Place ? Thomas . Whether he has any Right to go in there , I do n't know , - any farther than to see that all the Candles are out , and every Body in Bed . Prisoner . Could not the Deceased have seen whether my Candle was out , without coming into my Barrack ? Thomas . Yes ; 't is but a poor slight Enclosure of slit Deal . If there 's any Light in it , those on the Outside may see it ; and if there 's Light without , the Person within may see that too . There was no Candle in his Apartment , when I took him Prisoner . Q . If there had been a Light in this Place , had the Officer of the Night any Right to have forced the Door open ? Thomas . I do n't know . But if any Abuse is given , the Officer has a Power to take the Person that is Guilty of the Offence , and carry him Prisoner to the Main-guard . Q . Might he have enter 'd , and have taken him from thence , in Order to have carry 'd him to the Main-guard ? Thomas . Yes : He was under the Command of the Serjeant for Night , in that Place , as much as if he had been in a common Barrack . Counc . Had he , as Superiour of the Night , any Power to go in and strike him ? Thomas . There 's no such Thing as striking , in the Military Way . Prisoner . I ask if there was not a large Quantity of Powder there ? Thomas . There is some Powder there to be sure . Q . Who keeps the Key of this Place ? Thomas . He padlocks it himself on the Outside when he goes out . The Serjeant that has the Care of the Company , keeps the Things that are for the Use of the Company ; and the Prisoner kept the Company 's Linnen there , and the Colonel 's Things . Q . Do you know whether there 's any Fastening on the Inside ? Thomas . There 's a Kind of a Nail and a String on the Inside . Councel . Did not the Prisoner buy this Apartment ? Thomas . I do n't know whether he or the Colonel paid for it . Daniel Vandervoren , Serjeant . I was not there when this happen 'd : But I know the Apartment where the Prisoner lay . Q . If any Person that lies in that Place , occasions a Disturbance , or abuses the Serjeant that commands for the Night , may he open that Place to correct or apprehend the Person that offends ? Vandervoren . No ; I think not . I know , the Serjeant that commands has Power to quiet any Man ; he is empower 'd to take him Prisoner , and carry him to the Main-guard . Each Serjeant takes his Week , and we are to see every Man in their Barracks at such an Hour ; he is to keep them in Peace and Quietness , and at such a Time , to take Care that all the Candles are out . By Virtue of this Power , if his Brother Serjeants , or Corporals disobey Orders , they are liable to be taken Prisoners , and Complaint is made to the superiour Officers , but they are not to give Correction themselves to any Serjeant . Prisoner 's Defence . Geo Smith . I was going thro ' their Barrack when the Dispute began , and I saw the Deceased lift up his Hand and strike the Prisoner . He struck him with his Fist , somewhere over the Face , and I think I saw a Pipe fall , but I can not say the Deceased struck it out of his Mouth . I have known the Deceased three Years , and never heard that he was given to Quarrelling . Councel . Did you never hear of his Quarrelling with Serjeant Vanderooren ? Smith . No . Serjeant Lindsay . I can give but the same Account of the Quarrel as hath been already given ; there was a great deal of ill Language given on both Sides , both before , and after the Deceased was in Bed , and the Prisoner had shut himself up in his Place . The Deceased lay with me , and I bid them both be quiet , or I would take a File of Men , and carry them both to the Guard . The Deceased said , he 'd get up , and pull the Prisoner 's House down , and send him to Hell . I know them both perfectly well , and have done so , 9 or 10 Years . In the Way of Strength or Handy-Cuffs , the Deceased , I believe , would have been too hard for the Prisoner , tho ' he is a lusty Man . I could not prevail upon them to be quiet , but provoking Language still being given , the Deceased jumped out of Bed , and got a Candle from another Barrack , and came with it to the Prisoner 's Door : He took hold with one Hand and shook it ; then he sat down the Candle , and put both Hands to it , and shook it again : There was Room enough over the Door , for him to put his Hands in : As I was getting out of Bed to prevent the Dispute , the Door open 'd , the Deceased fell back , and I caught him in my Arms , and laid him upon our Bed . He never quarrell 'd with me , but he has quarrell 'd with the Prisoner , and I have parted them several Times . The Prisoner always lay in that Apartment , and 't is usual for him to fasten the Door on the Inside . I know he does , because I once wanted to speak with him when he was a Bed , and I shook the Door , but I could not get in , 'till he 'rose and opened it himself . The Deceased lov 'd a Glass of Liquor , and in his Cups would sometimes be fractious . Q . Where there any Words between the Prisoner and the Deceased before the Door opened . Lindsay . Not a Word . Vandervoren . I was the Deceased 's Comrade 10 Years . In Liquor he would sometimes be good humour 'd , and sometimes quarrelsome . He never quarrell 'd with any Body when he was sober . I know the Prisoner too , very well : I have seldom seen him in Liquor . We have all been Friends together , the Prisoner , the Deceased and I . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty on both Indictments . Death . 12 , 13 , 14. Robert Oliver , Joseph Egglestone , and Thomas Karnes , were indicted for breaking and entering the House of Francis Halford in the Parish of St. Olave Hert street , about the Hour of One in the Night , and stealing 2 .

[ Transportation . See summary . ] 18 Mary Lee , of St. Ann 's Black-Fryars , was indicted for stealing 4 Guineas and 35 s. in Money , from the Person of , May 27 . W - T - . I had been drinking very freely with some Friends in Thames-Street , and meeting with the Prisoner in St. Paul 's Church-yard she conducted me to a House in Evangelist 's Court in Black Fryars . I had 11 Guineas and a half , a 6 s. Piece , and 35 s. in Silver in my Pocket . When I came to her House , we went up Stairs together , and a Woman brought us up some Punch ; I staid some little Time , and then I lay down with her on the Bed , - and she pick 'd my Pocket . My Gold was in this Pocket , and I had thrust a great Piece of whited brown Paper upon it , to secure it , but she pull 'd out the Paper , and took 5 Guineas and the 36 s. Piece , the Paper I found on the Bed , but the 5 Guineas and the other Peice was gone . At the Watch-house she dropp 'd one Guinea from under her Petticoats , and as she did not claim it , I took it my self , and I have indicted her for 4 Guineas and a 36 s : Peice . There was no one in the Room but our selves and the Woman that brought in the Punch , and she did not stay with us , - she went down Stairs . I was in Liquor , but I was not insensible , for I told my Money by the Candle . C. If you was sensible , you was a very wicked , impudentt Man , to pick up this Woman in order to debauch her . W - T - . I ca n't pretend to justify the Thing : 'T is a wicked Thing to be sure ; but 't is what is often done when Men are in Liquor . Q . What did she say before the Justice ? W - T - . I perswaded her to deliver my Money to save Trouble , and she said it was not in her Power : this seem 'd to be a tacit Confession that she took it . After she had robb 'd me , she ran down Stairs in a hurry ; I follow 'd her , and the Woman of the House let her out , and shut me in , and then she blew out the Candle . The Bell-man was providentially going by , and ( he hearing the Noise ; seized her Prisoner . Ask him if he did not say when he pull 'd out his Money before me , that he had been done some Injury to before ; and that he was not willing to be served so again . W - T - . I told her what Money I had in my Pocket , and I bid her take Care what she did . - I had promised to make her a little Present , and that was 'all . Prisoner . I was stripp 'd quite naked in the Watch-house , and they found nothing upon me . He and my Landlady were fumbling in the Dark , - perhaps she might take his Money . W - T - . The Prisoner wou 'd had me to have lain there all Night , and then I suppose I should have lost all the Cloaths upon my Back . C And you would very well have deserv 'd it . William Sadler , Bell man . I was just by the Place , and I heard a Noise , - I am robb 'd , I am robb 'd - I will have my Money ; so I came back , and got 2 Watchmen , and away we came all 3 to the Alley : we heard the Gentleman cry , - he would have his Money , and we perceiv 'd they were struggling in the Entry ; by and by the Door flew open , and the Prisoner tumbled down 2 or 3 Steps at the Door . Madam , says I , I believe you 've hurt your self , I must take you up ; so I have , says she , and shall feel it for some Time . If I had not been there to have help 'd her up tho ' , she had gone cleverly off . The Gentleman came out presently , and charged us with her , so we took her to the Watch-house directly , and there she neither own 'd it , nor deny 'd it ; but a Guinea dropp 'd from her , and the Gentleman look 'd under the Table and took it up . Upon this I bid him search her , for he would find more where that came from , and she had her Hands - ( 't is a little immodest too , ) - here . This is the Truth , and I 'll stand by it , and die by it . John Crookshank , Constable . I was call 'd up about 1 or 2 o'Clock to take charge of the Prisoner . Mr. W - T - said she had robb 'd him of 5 Guineas , and a 36 s. Peice , but he had found one of the Guineas . She had no Petticoats on , only a loose Gown , and but one Stocking ; as I was carrying her to the Counter , she desired to be search 'd , where , says I ; shall I get Women to search you now , except they are Whores , - like your self . She was asked for the Money , and she said 't was out of her Power to produce it . Prisoner . I beg 'd and pray 'd , and crav 'd , and ask 'd them to search me : I had not a Farthing in the World , and my poor Cloaths , - they were not upon me . I have no Acquaintance in London , for I have been but a very little while in Town . C. You have been here long enough to be concerned in a very scandalous Affair . Acquitted . 19 Elizabeth Davis , otherwise Walker , was indicted for stealing a Silk Purse , value 12 d and 30 s. in Money , the Property of James Chapman , June 6 . Acquitted . 20. Hans Mac-Connel , otherwise Connel , of St . Ann 's Middlesex , was indicted for that he , June 16 , on Robert Hooper did make an Assault , and with a certain Knife , value 6 d. which he held in his Right Hand , in and upon the Throat of the said Robert , did strike and cut , giving him a Mortal Wound of the Breadth of 6 Inches , and the Depth of 3 Inches , of which Wound he instantly died . He was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . He was again indicted for assaulting Catherine the Wife of Robert Long , and giving her a Mortal Wound in the Throat , of the Breadth of 6 Inches , and Depth of 3 Inches , of which Wound she instantly died , June 16 . He was likewise charged by Virtue of the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Robert Long . On Thursday , June 16 , about I at Noon , I went out to Bromley , and left my Wife well at Home ; when I return 'd , I found my Wife murder 'd , her Throat was cut , and the Child 's Neck bone was disjointed ; it 's Head was cut almost off , it hung only by a bit of Skin to the Body . I lost 2 Watches out of the House , and my Wife 's Wedding-Ring was taken off her Finger . The Motto was , - God alone , - made us two one . I came Home about a quarter after 9 , and there was a dismal Sight for me ; they both lay on their Backs with their Throats cut . I heard what had happen 'd before I came Home , for Mr. Shelley and Scott met me as I was returning from Bromley , and told me my Wife was murder 'd . I imagine they were both knock 'd down first , for on each of their Heads , there was the Appearance of a Blow , which seem 'd to be given by a Hammer . When I got Home the Doors were shut , but there was Dr. Sprag , Dr. Hooker , Dr. Wilkinson , Mr. Hales , and the Father of the murder 'd Child in the House . Mr. Jetsome was there likewise ; but I was so 'frighted , I do n't remember what any of them said to me . Councel . Look on that Ring ? Long . 'T is very much like my Wife 's Ring : the Poesy is the same , and 't is about the same Size , I believe it to be the same , but I wo n't swear positively that it is the same . Richard Wentworth I remember the Prisoner ; on Thursday was 3 Weeks I met him in Ropemekers Fields by Lime house , about 5 o'Clock , within half a quarter of a Mile from Mr. Long 's House . He enquir 'd for Mr. Long 's House ; I told him I did not know any such Person ; then he went about 10 Doors further , and stopp 'd at Mrs. Chapman 's House . When he went from me he leaned upon the Posts before Mrs. Chapman 's Door , but I did not hear any Thing he said there . Q . Can you take upon you to swear the Prisoner is the same Person ? Wentworth . Yes ; he is the Man that spoke to me : I was with him before the Justice , and I am sure he 's the same Person that I spoke to in Ropemaker's-Fields . Margaret Chapman . I know the Prisoner again very well : I am positively sure he 's the Person that spoke to me that Day the Murder was committed . 'T was on a Thursday , but I do n't remember the Day of the Month ; he stopp 'd at my Door a Moment or two before 4 o'Clock . First he survey 'd the Gentlewoman 's House , then he came up and lean 'd upon one of the Posts , and asked which was Mr. Long 's , - Mr . Staples 's Brewer . Madam , says he , ( for he gave me that Title ) do you know where Mr. Long lives ? I ask 'd him , if he was sure he liv 'd in that Street ? He paus 'd a little , and then he said he did not know , - but he was informed that he lived in one of the new Houses against the School . Presently Mr. Hester 's School came into my Head , and I said , Sir you are mistaken in the Street ; so I bid him go thro ' that Arch ( to which I pointed ) and ask for the School , and 't was likely he would hear of him there . Q . What Cloaths had the Prisoner on ? Chapman . I can swear that he had the same Coat on then , that he has on now , but he had then under it , a green duffled Waistcoat . I have Reason to remember his Physiognomy , because he told me he hoped to have the Pleasure to see my Ears nail 'd to the Pillory , or else he would cut his own Throat : I know him from 5000 Men . Q . What distance do you live from Mr Long 's ? Chapman . I live in Ropemakers-Fields , and he lives at the Limekilns , about 3 Stones throw from my House . He stood a moment or two after I directed him : I took him to be a Bailiff , and that he kept prating to me 'till he could seize his Prey . Prisoner . Before the Justice she swore I had a Cinnamon colour 'd Coat . Chapman . I have sworn to his Coat , and you 'll find some body else will swear to it , by and by . - Gray I have look 'd at the Prisoner , and have taken a great deal of Observation upon him : ( have observed him well . ) I saw him that Thursday after 3 , 't was not 4 , - I wo n't say to a Minute or 2 . I was above Stairs , putting on my Cap , and I looked out of my middle Window ( for there 's 3 in the Front ) and saw the Prisoner standing cross the Kennel , and looking up to the Window . I thought he stood loitering there to stare at me , because I was without my Cap , so I slipp 'd it on and look 'd out again ; still he look 'd stedfastly up at me ; then I imagin 'd he saw something in the Beaufet that he wanted , for he did not look like another Man . After this I saw him go to Chapman 's House , which is exactly over the Way : I expected News ( from a Friend , ) and at last I thought he might be enquiring for me ; so I came down Stairs , but he was gone , - I saw no more of him . I took particular Notice of him at that Time , and I am sure he 's the Man that spoke to Mrs. Chapman , but I can not swear to his Cloaths . The Monday after , when the Prisoner was carry 'd to the Justice 's House , I saw him pass thro ' the Room where I was , and that very Minute I knew him , and said to Mr. Betty , - that 's the Man . Eliz Thomas . Between 5 and 6 o'Clock the Day the Murder was committed , I saw a strange Man in Mr. Long 's House . As I passed the Door , I saw him within the Door . I ca n't Swear positively 't was the Prisoner , but 't was such a jolly , full upright Man . Robert Hooper the Child , came about half a dozen Minutes after to buy a half-penny-worth of Cherries of me , and I serv 'd it , but the Child throwing down a Penny , I said , my dear , you must have more ; so I served it another Halfpenny-worth . I saw it come out of Long 's House , but I ca n't say I observ 'd it to go in again : I heard of the Murder about 2 Hours after . Marget Hope . I work at Mr. Birch 's , at the Lime-Kilns . The Day Mrs Long was kill 'd , about a Quarter before 6 , I saw a full-body 'd jolly fac 'd Man , with a dark Wig full of Powder , come out of Long 's House and he came towards me , as far as the second Post from Long 's Door , - towards Lime-house Corner . He stopp 'd as if he wanted to make Water , or was in a Consternation ; then he turn 'd round , stopp 'd short again , and went away towards Limehouse Marsh Wall . I ca n't swear the Prisoner is the Man , but 't was one very like him . Q . How far was you from him , when you saw him come out of Mr. Long 's ? Hope . About as far as from the Place where I now stand to the other Corner of this Court . ( Pointing to the Bale-Dock ) The Reason I took Notice of him , was this ; the Day before , a Man well dress 'd made Water before us all , and I thought this Man was going to do the same , and I resolved if he did , to affront him for his Impudence . Benj Harper . I have known the Prisoner some Years : I remember , the Day the Murder was committed , I met him about half an Hour after 6 , and shook Hands with him , near Mr Hoar 's Yard at Limehouse Marsh Wall . Q . What Cloaths had the Prisoner on ? Harper : I wo n't swear to any Cloaths : - He had a green Jacket on . I asked him to go and drink a Mug of Beer , and he said he could not stay . I then went on to Dick's-Shore , and there I heard of the Murder . Q . You met a Man and talk 'd with him , can you remember nothing concerning his Cloaths ? Harper . I will not swear to any Cloaths . C. You are sworn already to speak all that you know ; recollect yourself : - What colour 'd Cloaths had he on ? If you remember , you must tell us . Harper . If I meet a Man , it does not follow I should take Notice of his Cloaths Councel . Do n't be angry ; - I must ask you , upon your Oath , if he had not a green Waistcoat , or Jacket on , when you met him at the Marsh Wall ? Harper . I wo n't swear to Cloaths : - Councel . I ask you upon your Oath , if you have not said already , that he had a green Jacket on ? Harper . Why to the best of my Knowledge he had a green Jacket on , - and much such a Coat as he has on now . C. You are not to conceal any Thing , but to speak the Truth to the best of your Knowledge . Harper . To the best of my Knowledge he had the same Coat on then , that he has on now , and a green Jacket . Prisoner . How long has that Witness known me ? Harper . Seven or eight Years : At first he used to sell Callicoe ; then he used to buy Shells , and sell China Wrappers . The Evans confirmed Harper 's Evidence ; but he could not swear positively to the Prisoner , because he walked a little before them , while they talked and shook Hands . Mary Streffen . Between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon that the Murder was committed , I was sitting within Door by myself , and was knitting . A Man knocked at the Door , and asked if Mr. Long was at Home ; I told him he did not live here , and while I was directing him , I let my Stitches fall , which prevented me from taking Notice of his Face : I look 'd after him , and saw him lift up the Latch of Long 's Door , but I ca n't say I saw him go in . He had a caped Coat on , something darkish , dirty Ruffles , and was much such a sized Man as the Prisoner . Lydia Goodman . Between 3 and 4 - I ca n't say exactly , - it might be more , I went past Long 's House ; 't was the Day she was murder 'd . The Casement was open , and I saw a Man in the Room , he laughed , and shut the Casement as I passed by . I take it to be the Prisoner , I verily believe him to be the same Man . When he was before the Justice , he stood among 4 or 5 Men , and when I saw him , I thought I should have dropp 'd down , - I was so surprized . I went out into the Yard for a little Air , and I said to Mr. Hone , if you 'll go in with me , I 'll shew you the Man , that look 'd out of Long 's Window , or one very like him : And at this Time , no body had told me that he was the Man . George Rhodes . On Saturday Night after the Murder between 11 and 12 o'Clock , I went to the Prisoner 's House in Ratcliff-highway ; I saw him , and he every Way answer 'd the Description given of the Murderer . This is the Ring that his Wife sold the Day after the Murder , to Mr . Bond . That which was taken from Mrs. Long , being in the Advertisements that were publish 'd , Mr . Bond sent to let us know he had bought such a one . The Prisoner said he would carry us to the Pawnbroker he bought it of , and he told us , he gave 19 s. for it . We went there at this Time , only to ask them about the Ring , but the Man answering the Description given of the Person that was seen in Long 's House , we went again on Monday to take him up ; when the Constable took him , he said he had 2 Witnesses to prove where he was when the Murder was done ; and I said , - what need you talk of that , before you are charged with it . Mrs. Long was at my House on the Sunday and Monday before she was murder 'd , with the Ring on her Finger , and we talked about the Poesie : I believe the Ring that has been produced is the same , but there are no particular Marks on it Counc . When you went to take up the Prisoner 's Wife on the Saturday , did not you tell her your Suspicion with Regard to the Murder ? Rhodes . I charged the Officer with his Wife , on Suspicion of being concerned in the Murder , and ( I suppose ) I told her the Reason of my Suspicion . The Prisoner carry 'd us to a Pawnbrokers , where he said he bought the Ring and a Snuff-box , and the Pawnbroker looked over his Books , but he could find no such Things set down ; indeed he did say , he did not always set down what he sold . Giles Bond . I received this Ring on Friday the 17th of June , and gave her 15 s. for it : If the Price was not approv 'd of , she was to have it again . On Saturday I found such a Ring , two Watches , and 3 Spoons were advertised . The Ring having the Poesie mentioned in the Advertisement , I sent Notice I had bought such a thing ; upon this , Mr. Rhodes came to see it : He seem 'd positive 't was Mrs. Long 's Ring ; therefore I told him what Discourse had pass 'd between the Prisoner 's Wife and me , when she was at my Shop , and by recollecting that , we found where the Prisoner lived . As to the Motto of the Ring , 't is a common one , and there may be 500 such Rings about the Town . Defence . Mary Randal . I keep the Dog-Tavern at Billinsgate : The Prisoner I have known about two Years . He came to our House a little after One o'Clock on this Thursday , and dined with my Spouse upon Mackarel , in a Box at one Corner of the Kitchen . He said he was to attend a Trial at Guildhall , between Mr. Young ( who lives at the Queen's-Head in Alhallow's-Lane ) and his Servant . Mr. Randall had some Business at the Crown Coffee-house , so he went out with the Prisoner between 3 and 4 o'Clock . Q . How came you to be so Particular as to this Thursday ? Mrs. Randall . Because the Prisoner and his Wife came the Sunday following to our House , and she said , Lord , Mrs. Randall , I have been taken up on Suspicion of Murder , and told me about her selling the Ring : And he told me some People had said , if he had a green Waistcoat , they would swear it upon him . I remember the Cloaths he wore that Thursday : He had had the same Coat he has on now ; and a blue Waistcoat , which my Spouse took Notice was very dirty . Moses Jennings , confirmed Mrs Randal 's Evidence . Mr Gill Attorney . I sent the Prisoner this Subpaena on the 15th of June , to attend the next Day at 3 o'Clock at Guild hall , as a Witness in a Cause depending between William Griffin , Plaintiff , and Mr Young , Defendant , and he came to the Crown Tavern a little before 4 o'Clock , and staid there till 5 , then we went into the Hall together , and I saw him there several Times , walking to and fro in the Hall , between 5 and 6 ; there was not more than a quarter of an Hour 's Space between the Times of my seeing him , and a little after 6 , we all went entirely to the Tavern again , and staid till 8 . I do n't know that he left the Room from 6 to 8 . Mr. Waiteman confirm 'd Mr.Gill 's Evidence . Mr. Harrison , gave the same Account , that the Prisoner came to the Crown about 4 , that he staid there 'till near 5 , then they all went to Guild hall , and from 5 to 6 there was not a quarter of an Hour passed , but he saw him in the Hall . At 6 the Witness was not well , therefore he came away . Mr. Sympson , gave exactly the same Account with the former Witnesses , with this Addition , that the Prisoner wore then a caped Coat and a blue Westcoat . Mr Young and Mr. Dennevet , gave the same Account with the preceeding Witnesses . Honour Thompkins , and another Witness gave an Account , that they saw a Ring with the same Motto in the Prisoner 's Wife 's Possession , the Saturday before the Murder was committed . The Prosecutor then call 'd Francis Pearse , who deposed , that he had known the Prisoner some Years , that he saw him twice , the Day the Fact was committed ; once about 2 , and afterwards about 4 ; that he was then walking towards the Lime-kilns , but he did not speak to him . Mary Griffin and Sturgeon Langham , saw a Man at Lime-house that Day , very like the Prisoner , but could not swear he was the same . George Harris deposed , that a Coat was brought to him the Day after the Murder , to be scower 'd , he believ 'd it was the same the Prisoner had upon his Back ; but there was no Blood upon it . Mr. Betty High Constable , search 'd the Prisoner 's House the Monday following , and found nothing to give any Light into the Affair ; he found 2 foul Shirts , and asked if the Prisoner had any more , the Maid told him she had just given the rest of them out to be washed , but could tell nothing of the Washer-woman , not where she liv 'd . Hannah Groves for the Prisoner , swore she likewise saw him June 16 , about 4 o'Clock at the Crown Tavern , and afterwards at Guild hall . Acquitted . 21.

Faith 's under St. Paul 's , was indicted for stealing 38 Guineas , and 2 s. in Money , the Property of John Best , June 14 . Ann Best I live at Silsoe in Bedfordshire . On the 13th of June I pack 'd up 40 l under a Lump of Butter , - in the middle of a Flat ( of Butter ) that was to come to London I saw it loaded in the Waggon , that it could not be come at , unless the Waggon was unloaded . I usually sent up Money to London in that manner , under a Flat of Butter . I put up 38 Guineas and 2 s. and the Basket in which the Flat was put , I ty 'd fast with 2 Strings . The Direction was in the Inside of the Lid , that no one should see it , unless the Flat was unty 'd . This Butter was directed to my Sister White , and William had the Delivery of it . George Lee I loaded the Waggon , and drove it on the 13th of June to South Mimms , but I knew nothing in particular of this Flat of Butter , or of the Money , - I had 40 Flats ( I believe ) in the Waggon at the same Time . Q . Was this Flat remov 'd before you came to London ? Lee . I drove the Waggon to South Mimms , and it was not mov 'd while it was carrying to that Place . Thomas Whitehead . When the Waggon came in at South Mimms , it stay 'd there about an Hour , and then I drove it to Newgate Market . Q . Did you travel all Night ? Whitehead . Yes ; in Company with other Waggons : And nothing was taken out , 'till I came to Rose street End ; there I stopp 'd and unloaded for Newgate Market . I deliver 'd the Things my self , to Daniel Pettit , my Master 's Porter , and he carry 'd them up the Street into the Market . He is a Porter that belongs to the Waggon , and its my Business to deliver these Flats to him . Daniel White . I am a Salesman in the Market . William Best is Brother to the Carrier , and marry 'd my Sister . I gave him Liberty to open my Letters , and take Care of my Money . On the 14th of June , I came to Market , about 4 o'Clock , and he gave me a Letter , and told me there was 40 l in this Flat , but the Prisoner had got it away : - A Villain ! ( says I ) run after him , and see for the Money . William Best came back , and said the Butter was safe , but the Money was gone . I ran out of the Market to Mrs White 's , and said to the Maid , - shew me where this Rascal lives ; so the Wench and I , went to the Prisoner 's House , and I look 'd in an old Chest of Drawers , - if I could have found the greasy Bag , I should have been satisfy 'd . But a little Trunk in the Room feeling heavy , I asked the Girl that was there to unlock it ; she did so , and in this Trunk there were several Parcels of Money , - several little Parcels of Money , but not such a Parcel as I wanted . - I believe there might be about 40 l in all . What gave me Reason to suspect him , was this , - about 5 Weeks before , I saw him routing among the Goods in my other Shop ( where I give a Brother of mine , Leave to pitch his Parcels ; ) and I said to him , - you Rascal , what Business have you there ; for I had a Letter from my Sister , to inform me , she had sent me 328 l. 4 s. in the Goods . He told me at that Time , that he wanted his Mistress 's ( Mrs White 's ) Butter . I told him he had a great Assurance to rout over the Goods , when there was no body to deliver them to him ; and I charged him never to touch them without Will Best was present ; for he is appointed to deliver them , and take the Money , - or Book them . The Prisoner having seen Best take Money out of this Flat , occasio 'd me to warn him not to meddle with any of them . He has used the Market many Years : I ca n't say I ever heard him charged with any such Act before . Anthony Willcox . The Prisoner came to the Shop about a Quarter after 3 in the Morning , and unty 'd the Flat of Butter , and look 'd in it ; then he ty 'd it down again , and carry 'd it to Mrs. White 's . Council . The Directions are in the Inside : Is it not usual for the Porters to open these Flats , to see where they should be carry 'd ? Willcox . It has been done ; but they should not do so , 'till they have Orders . I have known him 20 Years , and never heard that he wrong 'd any one all that Time . Q . Can you tell whose Flat it was , which he open 'd ? Willcox . No ; I saw him take one , but I do n't know whose it was . Daniel Pettit . I am a hired Servant to Mr. Best , and when the Waggon is unloaded , I carry the Goods to the Place in the Market where they are always pitch 'd , and that Morning as I was carrying a Parcel up the Street from the Waggon , I met the Prisoner coming down , with a Flat of Mrs. White 's , upon his Back , going toward her House . This was between 3 and 4 o'Clock in the Morning . Sarah White . I have order 'd the Prisoner to bring my Flats as soon as he could , but I did not do so that Morning , nor do I know that he ever brought any so early . 'T was brought an Hour sooner than usual ; I was a-bed , and my Servant was present at the opening of it . I have indeed , when I have wanted Butter , order 'd him to bring me a Parcel , without waiting for Will Best . I have known the Prisoner 7 or 8 Years , and look 'd upon him to be an honest Fellow . Our Flats generally come ty 'd up ; but this had been open 'd to look for the Money , tho ' I ca n't say whether it was open when 't was deliver 'd . Susan Young . I am Mrs. White 's Servant . I received the Flat that Morning from the Prisoner , and the Clock struck 4 as he went out of the House . I ca n't tell whether it had been open 'd or not , when I receiv 'd it , but Pettit a little while after it came in , had open 'd it in the Cellar , and when I went down , he said he could find no Money in it . William Best . I usually deliver 'd Mrs. White 's Butter to the Prisoner , but this Flat he took before I came to Market , tho ' I had order 'd that no Body should meddle with the Goods till I came to Market . I sent Pettit to look in the Flat for the Money before it was missed , but he brought me Word , it was gone . I have charged the Prisoner more than a Month before this , not to meddle with the Goods till I came Prisoner . Mrs. White has given me general Orders not to stay for Mr. Best 's coming , but to bring the Goods as soon as I could . Mr. Humphreys , Mr. Philpot , Mr. Pocklington , Mr. Weston , Mr. Doiman , Mr. Fletohen , all gave the Prisoner a very extraordinary good Character Acquitted . 39.
