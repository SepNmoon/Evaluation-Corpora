LONDON Printed for William Smith , 1674 . News from the Session-House , & c The End of Magistracy is to be a Terror to Evil-Doers , and a Praise to them that do well : The end of Law , To settle and secure Propriety , distribute to every one his own , and punish all that shall disturb the Common-Peace which it endeavours to preserve by severe Penalties , not so much simply to Torture the present Malefactor , as to forewarn others from the like Crimes , or ( as the great Oracle of our Municipal Laws expressed it ) Ut paena ad paucos , timor ad omnes per veniat . That the punishments inflicted on a few may by an Exemplary Caution create fear in all , and for this very End is the present Narrative of the Transactions of the last Sessions published , being as follows . The Sessions being held at Justice-Hall in the Old Bayly for London and Middlesex , on the 17th of the Instant , there being five persons received Sentence of Death . The first was one Thomas Whitehead , who being in Newgate , was by order of the former Sessions of the 3d . of June , to remain there upon suspicion of Fellony , whence he once made an escape , and was retaken , and then by the assistance of some Friends he had procured an Order for his Inlargement , and was to have gone forth as the next day , but he being as it seems impatient to be kept so long from his old Profession , the Trade of Stealing , and finding himself by reason of such an Order , not so strictly lookt after by the Keepers as otherwise he would have been ; he took an opportunity once more to get away out of Custody , but to little purpose , for falling to his Practise as soon as ever he was got forth , the very Night he was taken for having committed Burghlary , by breaking open an house , and Stealing goods to the value ( as the Jury found it ) of 4. pounds , the evidence was plain against him , and he had little to say for himself , so that he was Convicted , and ( being notoriously Incorrigible ) had Sentence of Death pass 'd upon him . The second John Rogers , who was brought in by Habeas Corpus from Canterbury Goal for Fellony the 14 th of July Instant , He was Indicted for Stealing of a Mare of four pounds price , and a Guelding of 8. pounds price from one William Webb , and by another Indictment for Stealing a Gelding of the value of Ten pounds from one Edward Carey , upon both which Indictments he was found Guilty , though he used many Evasions to excuse himself , yet the evidence was full and clear , and he was known to have been concern 'd formerly , and so received likewise sentence of Death . The third Roger Elvin , Indicted for Burghlary having on the 13 th of July broken Feloniously into the House of Elizabeth Oldridge in Coleman Street London , and took from thence nine Pewter Dishes , a Pewter Cullendar , and other things , which he Exposing to Sale , was thereby discovered , and for the same now Condemned to die . The Fourth was George Wormington , who was committed at first for Robbing one Mr. Hall in Old-Street , but now at his Tryal there came in Two Indictments against him , one for Feloniously Breaking open the house of the said William Hall , and Stealing the Goods valued at nine and Twenty shillings , and the other for a Burghlary committed in the house of one Mr. Newmar , and taking thence Feloniously Goods to the value of Ten pounds , Both which being made evidently appear , he likewise received Condemnation . The last was William Sadler who appeared in Court upon Bail the 18 th of July Instant , but was Indicted for , and Convicted of several Fellonies and Burghlaries , for which sentence passed against him . Besides these persons Condemned to die , there were 5 . Convicted of severall Felonies which desired the mercy of the Court for transportation , and had it granted , being sentence 'd accordingly , of whom one Mall . Floyd was particularly remarkable for her Crime , she having it seems found out a new Trade not simply to Kidnapp or steal little Children quite away , But to Inveigle them to some strange by places and there rifle them , and so turn them abroad to shift for themselves , Thus the Third of July meeting a pretty little Child of about 8 yeares of Age neatly drest in Shoe Lane , She pretending She came from her Mother , carryed it with her as farr as St Giles 's , and had it into an Alehouse there , where seeing it rain , She pretended all the Childs Cloathes would be Spoiled , and under that pretence took away from it Severall Laces and peices of Linnen Knots and the like , and then carrying her into St Giles 's Churchyard where there then happened to be a Burial , She Lost her in the Crowd of People , who then not Knowing where She was , nor the way home , fell a crying , and was brought home that Night by some honest Inhabitant there abouts , where she told all the sad Story , but could not in the least declare who it was had served her so , or where she might be heard of , nor was there any probability of her being discovered , had it not strangely been disclosed by Accident , for the very next day the Childs Mother passing up Holbourn , saw some of her Childs things hang up in a Shop to be sold , which She knew again and acquainted the people of the Shop there with , who after some time and much trouble found out this Woman that sold the things to them who upon her Examination Confessed the whole matter before the Justice , and was Committed to Newgate , ( having been often a distressed Lady before in that Inchanted Castle ) from whence She is now by Sentence to be Transported to some of the Plantations beyond the Seas . There were likewise seven that being Convicted of Felonies within the benefit of Clergy , prayed the favour of their Book , and in memory of their notable Clarkship , received a Badge of Honour from Squire Catches Generosity . Three others Convicted of Petty-Felonies were Repreived before Judgment , And three more ordered to do Pennace at the Tail of a Cart . Wormington Confessed that he had been a Vile Sinner , and had gloried too much in Sin : he acknowledged that one Night he broke up a Milliners Shop in Bishops-gate-street , and had made up his Bundle ready to go away , but hearing the Watch coming , let his Bundle lie , and stood before the Door , the Watch asking who was there , he answered , I wish you had come sooner for my Shop is broken open , and I stand here to secure my Door , and desired them , that if they should see any suspicious Persons , to secure them , and so soon as they were gone , took up his Bundle and made his Escape ; But now he was very Penitent , and desired all persons to take Example by him ; The others were very Penitent also , and often calling upon God to forgive them their former Sins , and wished that all people would take warning by their sad lamentable Ends .
