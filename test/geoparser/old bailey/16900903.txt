See summary . ] Lieutenant James Weames was Indicted for a high Misdemeanour , in speaking Scandalous and Seditious Words against the King and Government . ( that is to say ) That a great number of French were landed in England , and that they were come to place the Rig hteous King in his Throne ; and that the Land would never be blest till that was done : And that the Nobility of England were a parcel of Fat Rogues , and what they did for King William was not so much for the sake of Religion , but to save their wealth and Honor : And that the King , ( meaning King William ) was a Villain , a Dutch Dog and an Usurper , in coming to take his Fathers Crown from him . This was the substance of the Matter that was sworn against him , on the King 's side . To invalidate which , the Prisoner produced numerous Evidence , who knew him very well , giving a particular and clear account of the Prisoner 's Reputation : That he had always been a very zealous Protestant , and very well affected to the Present Government , as might appear divers ways ; witness his forward Zeal in New-England ( being sent thither under the Command of Sir Edward Andrews , in the Time of the late King James ) for as soon as he heard of the Alteration in the present stage of Affairs , here in England , he presently caused all the Guns in the Fort , which were in number about 14 or 15 , to be discharged , and made a vigorous Defence also against the French and Indians , when they came to make an Incursion upon the Plantation : Besides , he had always spoke well of King William and Queen Mary , and always went to Church , and was a true Protestant & c. But , you must note , That the Prosecutor swore against him out of meer Revenge , as may appear thus : The man who swore against him was his servant in New-England , but behaved himself there very ill ; upon which his Master the Lieutenant , gave him some small Correction , after which the Fellow was heard several times to threaten him , That if ever he returned to England he would be revenged on him , or to that effect . But besides this , the Lieutenant returning to England , he had frequent communication with the Witness , and had a Trunk at his House which the Witness kept from the Prisoner , upon some slight occasion ; upon which the Lieutenant arrested him , and there was an Agreement made : But the Witness after that was heard to pronounce more Threats against the Lieutenant ; and so upon the whole matter , the Court looking upon it to be a malicious and base Prosecution , the Prisoner was acquitted . John Lowthorp , Clergyman , was indicted for a high misdemeanour , in Writing , Printing and publishing a most pernicious , scandalous , Seditious and Notorious Libel ( on the th of July last , and at divers other times as well before as after ) against the King and Government , Entituled a Letter to the Lord Bishop of Satum in answer to his Lordship 's Pastoral Letter . In which scandalous Libel there are many Treasonable Sentences . There were many other very reflecting Sentences said against him , that he made use of to support his Designs , which was purely and indeed to Raise Rebellion and Discord between the King and People , on purpose to set the Nation into a Flame , and to cause them to cut each others Throats ; which was more fully laid open against him by the King 's Counsel , and the whole Court , telling him , That he ought to have been Indicted of High Treason , and that his Message to the World ( as he was a Clergyman ) was to preach the glad Tidings of Peace and Salvation , but instead of that he had done all he could to perswade Men , That unless they repent , and bring in King James again , they were all damned . All this was fully proved against him , as also the Writing , Printing and Publishing of the Book or Letter , which in all contained 5 Sheets and a half of Paper , about 400 of which were found in his Custody . Now for the Vindication of himself he had little to say , only urged , That he writ to the Bishop , to beg his Advice and fatherly Instruction ; and that if he had offended by it and mistook his measures , he was heatrily sorry for it , ( on the like ) : so after a Fair Hearing the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . The said John Lowthers was Fined 500 Masks , and the said Books was ordered to be Burnt by the Common Hangman at the Palace-Yard Westminster , at Charing-Cross , and without Temple bar and to remain in Prison till the same be paid , And to be Degraded of the Ministering Function .
