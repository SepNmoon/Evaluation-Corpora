 Whether I left the Key in the Door or not I can not say , but the Goods were missing in the Morning . I found the Things upon her Back at the House where we were drinking Gin the Night before ; she owned having the Brass Candlestick , but would not say where she had pawned it . Elizabeth Tod . I live in the House with my Neighbour , these were his Wife 's Cloaths , they lay upon the Back of the Chair ; when he missed them , says he , Where 's my Shirt ? she owned the taking of the Candlestick before the Justice , but said she threw it away . Said I , she has taken your Wife 's Cloaths , and you will find her at such a Place . I found the two Petticoats and the Stays , but the Gown she said she had given away . Prisoner . I was going along Bishopsgate-street , and he asked me how I did , and whether I would go and drink , which we did ; and he asked me whether I would go with him to his House , which I did , for he said he was a single Man then . Acquitted . 80 , 81 , 82 , George Anderson , Richard Studder , Henry Hinton , of St John , Wapping , were indicted for feloniously breaking open and entering the House of John Inwood , about the Hour of one at Night , and taking from thence 3 Pieces of Cantaloon Stuff 80 Yards , one Piece of printed Linnen 22 Yards , 14 Ells of Linnen , and 2 Remnants of Bays , all to the value of about 4 l. the Property of John Inwood , July 23 . John Inwood . I live in Milk-Alley , in the Parish of St. John Wapping ; I am a Shipwright by Trade , but my Wife is chiefly in the Shop Business : July the 22d in the Evening the Shop was shut up fast , about 10 a-Clock before I went to Bed , it was locked , barred , and bolted , and about four in the Morning I was informed the Shop was broke open , and the two Shutters lying on the Ground , there was a Pane of Glass broke , and the Goods were taken out , that are mentioned in the Indictment : I am positive the Night before the Goods lay in the Window within reach of being taken out by a Hand Put thro ' that Pane of Glass . Thomas Studder . On the 23d of July this Anderson the Soldier and I were walking together in Wapping , about one o'Clock in the Morning we met Richard Studder and Hinton ; this Anderson mentioned that he in the Day-time saw these things lying in the Window and proposed the taking of them , and about two in the Morning Anderson , who is a Cobler by Trade , and I , by the Means of his Pinchers , pulled the Groove of the Window off , that the Shutters slide upon ; I broke the Pane of Glass , I took the Goods off the Window and gave them to Anderson ; Anderson and Hinton held open the Bag , and all these things were put in and Studder stood close to the Bag ; the Pieces of course Sheeting , and one of the Pieces of Stuff , were sold to Mrs Gill for Half a Guinea , the Half Guinea was divided between us all , 2 s. and 6 d. a Piece , and the odd 6 d. was left in my Brother Richard Studder 's Hand , and he has it yet : Mrs Gill finding these to be stolen Goods , she would not keep them , but returned them ; the Goods were cried , a Search-Warrant was granted , and they were found in the House of Richard Studder . - Miller the Thieftaker 's Wife took me , and the Prisoners were taken up on my Information , having made myself an Evidence . Hinton the Prisoner . He sent Unwin after us , I was going out with China and Earthen ware . Unwin . I informed Mr Inwood I thought Richard Studder was the Man , we searched his House and found a large Quantity of the Goods . Thomas Studder hearing of this came to my House and offered himself a voluntary Evidence , for he had been guilty of several Robberies , and he said he wanted to make himself clear in the World . I went to Justice Jones and told him this , he said he would admit him an Evidence the next Morning , it being late then , which he did : He named the three Prisoners , Crocket and Emanuel Hubbard , I met Anderson and took him , and he said he believed his ( the Evidence 's ) Brother and Hinton , were at Mother Rippon 's at Epping : I hired some People and Horses , and went down and took them . Anderson and Studder would have made themselves Evidences , but Hinton did not care what became of himself if he could save Studder ; near the Place where I live there is about 60 of this Crew ; Studder , and the Keeper of New Prison 's Son , were the Leaders of this Gang ; we could hardly stir out of Doors for them . John Upwood Constable . This is the Bays that was found in Studder 's House . Prisoner Anderson . My Lord , here are a parcel of Thief-takers here , they would swear our Lives away . Inwood could not swear positively to the Goods , there being no Marks on them , but said , they were very much like them . Nathanael Harris . I went to Mother Rippon 's at Epping , and as soon as Richard Studder saw my Head , he jumped out of Window , and Hinton was going to do the same , but I caught hold of his Coat , and prevented him , but Studder was soon taken . Pray , said I to him , where are your Pistols ; said he , I exchanged them with Matthew Mooney * for his Buckles . I am a Hatter in Rosemary-Lane . * See No . 58. p. 24 . Prisoner Richard Studder . He wanted to swear my Life away once before . - Harris , you are a very dangerous Man . Hinton . Harris said to me , if you have five or six Pounds I may serve you , if not , I will have your Life . Harris . I never said any such Thing , nor never spoke a Word concerning any Money , for I could not expect any . [ Unwin called . ] Court . You are upon your Oath ; have you received any Money from any of the Prisoners , or any of their Relations . Unwin . There was Money offered , and I believe I might have had a considerable Sum ; and a Gold Watch , the Prisoner Studder offered it , if I could any ways serve him , and save his Life : But I had not any Thing . Prisoner Studder . He has all my Goods . William Palmer Hind . I was at the taking of Anderson , and he said I would have Thomas take care to lay his Informations fully , or else I shall make mine fuller than his before Colonel Deveil . Prisoner Anderson . That is a Lie , it was before Justice Dennel . Hind . He desired to know if he could be made an Evidence , he asked that several Times . - There was a Pair of Pistols produced . Thomas Studder . These are the Pistols which were taken from Matthew Mooney , who was convicted last Thursday ; I believe these were my Brother 's , though the Marks are rubbed off . Edward Baily . I have know Anderson four or five Years ; he is a Cobler in Rag-fair , he does not keep a Stall , but works for several Masters : I am his Brother-in-Law . I always thought him an honest Man , and one that worked hard for his Bread : I am a Brasier , and live in Broad street , Soho ; but I sell Goods to the Brokers there . Susanna Baily . I am the Prisoner 's own Sister , ( she cries ) I said to this Gentleman , Mr Unwin , Dear Sir , do not take away an innocent Life for the sake of the Reward ; he said if you had come about a Fortnight ago , I could have served you , and if I could get Money my Brother should not be hurt ; I do not say he mention 'd any particular Sum . Elizabeth Boswell . I have known this Fellow ever since he sucked at his Mother 's Breast , 34 or 35 Years ago ; I am 45 Years of Age , ( the Prisoner looked to be full as old ) I live in Broad St Giles 's and deal in Rag-Fair ; I never heard any ill of him . James Dickson . I have known him three or four Years , I always took him to be an honest Man . Unwin . As to that Woman ( Anderson 's Sister ) she said she would give me a Note of her Hand for 20 l. if I could save his Life , for she was a free Dealer , and would pay it at so much a Week ; the Husband said no , that was too much , he said about 3 l would do , but I never did offer any thing concerning taking of Money . All three Guilty , Death . 83.

I lost a Pair of Stays out of my Shop , the 17th of July last . The Prisoner at the Bar came into the Shop and cheapened a great many . I fitted her with a Pair , and missing this Pair , I searched her ; she opened her Breast , said she , Do you think I can have them here ? she opened her Gown , and I put my Hand under her Coat , and there was a Bag tied round her Waste , and the Stays were in that Bag , these are my Goods . She begged I would not prosecute her . Prisoner . I never was in her Shop in my Life . Compton . My Son , and my Son 's Wife both , saw the Stays taken out of the Bag . Guilty , 4 s. 10 d.

I have taken in several Rings of her before , and took her to be a very honest Woman , for she dealt very fairly . Mary Hunt . This is my Wedding-Ring . Guilty . [ Transportation .

Catherine Davis and Jane Canwell were indicted for stealing six Yards three Quarters of Thread Lace , val . 40 s. the Property of William Coverley , in the Shop of William Coverley , Sept. 1. Frances Coverley . I keep a Milliner 's Shop in White-Chapel . On the first of September , the two Prisoners at the Bar came into my Shop , and cheapened some Lace , Davis said she wanted it to make some Baby-Cloaths . I missed a Piece of Lace , and my Son pursued them , and overtook them , and they were designed to be searched at this Gentleman 's ( Mr Crawley 's ) House . This Lace was in my Box when they came into the Shop . I saw the Lace drop from Canwell . I had a Suspicion , because they bid me a great deal under the Value of it . Davis was at some small Distance from the Lace when it was taken off the Ground . Canwell . Have I not been several Times at your House , and laid out Money with you ? Coverley . She has been twice at my Shop , bought Goods and paid for them . Canwell . Did not Davis take the Lace , and put it upon me . Frances Coverley . I should rather think Davis took it ; I had never seen her before , she looked like an ill Person . - This is not the Lace they cheapened - I can not say Canwell handled any of the Lace , though she might , for the Box was close to each of them , - they stood even with one another . Elizabeth Smith ( Servant to Mr Crawley ) . These two Women came to my Master 's House , they were both sitting close together up Stairs . Davis got up , and one Part of the Lace stuck to Davis 's Cloaths , and the other Part lay upon the Ground . They said they knew nothing of the Matter . Gerrard Crawley . My Cousin Coverley came to my Shop with these two Women . They were unwilling to go up Stairs at first , but they did go ; when they came into the Room , my Cousin said , One of you two have robbed me of a Piece of Lace . They were a little amazed , and my Cousin said , I am determined you shall be searched ; and the shortest one ( that is Davis ) got up and said , Search me , Madam ; and the other went towards the Window ; and I saw the Lace drop from her outward Garment , and part of it stuck to her Cloaths ; it did not drop from that Side next to Davis , but the opposite Side . George Coverley . My Mother missing the Piece of Lace , she and I followed them , I overtook them by the Mansion-House . I said I wanted to speak with them , and they must come back . Says one of them , What will the Gentlewoman let us have the Lace ? I said , she wanted to speak with them ; they came back to Mr Crawley 's House , in Leaden-hall-street , and then they were told what we wanted with them . David Gilham . I have known Canwell about two Years , her Husband is a Lapidary , I never heard any Ill of her . Anne Young had known her twenty Years , Martha Foxon four Years , and Ann Jones , Susan Phillips , Mary Woolball , and James Woodward , have known Canwell several Years , and gave her the Character of a very honest Woman . Catherine Davis * guilty 4 s. 10 d. Jane Canwell acquitted . * Davis had not one Person to her Character , though she had a great many last Sessions , when she was tried by the Name of Mary Shirley , for robbing Mr Setcole , Linnen-Draper in Smithfield . See her remarkable Trial , No . 21 . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 91 , 92 , 93. John Cooper . John Squire , and John Jennings , were indicted ( together with James Stewart , and George Ewins , not yet taken ) for that they in a certain Place near the King 's Highway , called Grace 's Alley , upon Joseph Daniel , did make an Assault , and put him in corporal Fear , taking from him a wooden Box , sixteen Metal Spurs , one Cock , and thirty Shillings in Money , the Property of the said Joseph Daniel . Joseph Daniel . On the 27th of June last , I think it was between one and two in the Morning , I was going up Well-Street in Rosemary Lane , I turned into an Alley called Grace 's Alley , and heard , as I thought , some Body come after me , presently a Man came up with me , as soon as I could I stopped to let him pass before me ; then I saw several Persons , one of them came up to me , said he , what 's here ; ( I had a Fowl in my Bag ; ) let go . I had another Bag under my Arm , in which were these Spurs , and some trifling Things ; the Man that first stopped me , and took the Fowl , asked me what I had got in my Pockets , and put his Hand into my Breeches Pocket , on the right Side , and took my Money : To the best of my Knowledge , I lost 50 s. though I have laid it but for 30 s. I begged them not to use me ill , as I was a working Man , to hinder me from getting my Living ; one of them held up a Thing like a Pistol , and said he would blow my Brains out if I spoke another Word , or to that purpose ; another held up a Thing like a Hanger , but being very much frightened , I can not be very particular , then one of them said come along ; said I Gentlemen , here is in one of these Bags only a Fowl , which will be but of little Use to you , and upon my saying that , one of them flew towards me in a great Fury , and said , he would blow my Brains out if I said any more ; then I went away . - I can not take upon me to say I know any Thing of the Prisoners at the Bar : A Person came to me some time afterwards and asked me if I had lost any Cock Spurs ; I said yes I had , the Man told me he would go with me on Sunday to look after them . - 'T was Mr Unwin at the Ship , near Well Close-Square , the Spurs are in his Custody ; this wooden Box I am positive I lost , the Spurs were in it . - It was darkish , I can not be positive whether there were Lamps or not . Q . What sized Men were they ? Daniel . I took them to be middle sized Men , but I can not be positive . I am a Plaue-maker by Trade . Q . So you divert yourself now and then with a little Cock-Match . Daniel . I am a Man that does not use much Company , so I think I may as well spend a little Time that way , as spend two or three Shillings any where else . William Hawkins . On the 27th of June the three Prisoners at the Bar , and I and two more , met Joseph Daniel at the End of an Alley near Well-Close-Square . - We all went out together to stop any Body that we met , and to take what we could from them - It was between one and two o'Clock in the Morning . - I knew Mr Daniel again as soon as ever I saw him . Ewins the Irishman asked him what he had in his Bag , and took it from him , and put his Hand in his Pocket , he took out what Money the Gentleman had in his Pocket , which he said was 22 s. and 6 d. which was shared among us ; so he sunk the rest . - Squire was searching his Pockets too . I do not know what was taken out of the other Pocket . Q . Did any Body hold up a Pistol ? Hawkins . Squire had a short Rolling-pin , which might be taken for a Pistol in a Surprize . That young Fellow John Cooper had a Hanger , Squire took the Bag with the Box and Spurs in it . - The Gentleman desired to have his Fowl again , said he , there is nothing in that Bag but a Fowl , I hope you will give it me back again ; and John Cooper said if he spoke another Word he would cut off his Nose ; the Cock Spurs Squire and Cooper sold in Rag-Fair for 3 s. The Fowl was dressed at Mr Smith 's , the Yorkshire Grey in Rag-Fair , on Monday Morning , Squire , Cooper and I were at the eating of it , Jennings was not ; the 22 s. and 6 d. was divided between us , we had 3 s. and 6 d. a Piece , and the other 18 d. was spent in Bottled-Ale and Brandy . Jennings . I am sure of it , I never was out with them before that Night . Hawkins . We robb 'd five People that Night , and every one of the Prisoners were with me then . - I believe this is the Box the Spurs were in ; I took particular Notice of it . Jennings . Please to ask him how long he has known me . Hawkins . I never knew him before that Night ; all five except Jennings were together , and we said we were going out together , and asked Jennings to go along with us , and he said he would ; I had drank with the others several Times , but was never out with them before upon that Account . Jury . Was Jennings in the hearing of them ? Did he know of your Design , that you were to go out to rob ? Because there 's a Difference between taking a Walk , and going out a Robbing . Hawkins . The Irishman said , in the Hearing of Jennings , they were going out to rob any Body we met , and to get what we could . - I am sure Jennings heard him say so , and knew our Design . Samuel Unwin , who keeps the Ship Alehouse . I know of these Spurs , I have seven Pair and an odd one . After Mr Jones , the City-Marshal , had taken up these two Men , ( that is Cooper and Squire ) I heard of the Robbery in Well-Close-Square , and went to Miller , and he said they were sold to his Wife for Silver . I made an Enquiry of one at the Red-Lion Cock-Pit , whether he knew any Body who had been robbed of any Cock-Spurs ; upon that he made an Enquiry , and found them to be Mr Daniel 's . All Three guilty , Death . 94. Mary Mathews was indicted with John Johnson , not yet taken , for stealing one Guinea , one half Guinea , and a Quarter of a Moidore , and 6 s. and 6 d. in Money , the Property of Matth.ew Insom , August the 23d . Insom . A Fortnight ago last Monday , between seven and eight in the Morning , I was in Rag-Fair ; there was no Person in my Company but this Mathews , at a House which is called the Hay field ; I was drinking a Pint of Beer , there she picked me up , and carried me to one Johnson 's , who keeps a private House : We drank together , but I refused drinking any thing but all Ale . We were in a Room by ourselves ; as soon as I came out of the House I missed my Money . I was not there passing half an Hour - I know I had my Money in my Pocket a Quarter of an Hour before I came out of the House ; and in half an Hour 's Time I met her in my Way . - I am sure she is the Person that robbed me . I carried her before Justice Richards , and she pleaded she had not a Halfpenny Piece about her . And the Money was found about her there was a Guinea , and 10 s. 3 d. Joseph Goadby . I found 31 s. 3 d. in her Pocket , though she said she had not a Farthing . Acquitted . 95 , 96. Ralph Coster , and Thomas Coster , of the Parish of St Mary Islington , in the County of Middlesex , Labourers , were indicted , for that they not having God before their Eyes , but being moved and seduced by the Instigation of the Devil , on the 16th Day of August , in the Sixteenth Year of His Majesty 's Reign , in and upon the Body of John Lack , feloniously did make an Assault with a cert ain Dagger made of Iron and Steel , value 6 d. which he , the said Ralph , held in his Right-hand , and him the said John one mortal Wound did give , of the Breadth of half an Inch , and the Depth of 3 Inches , of which Wound he instantly died : And that the said Thomas Coster was then and there aiding , abetting , assisting , comforting and maintaining the said Ralph the said Murder to commit : And that they the said John Lack did kill and murder against the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , & c . Josias Lack . The Deceased was my Father : He was killed the 16th Day of last August , in the Road leading from Aldersgate-Street to Islington , near the Turnpike . - The next Day we got a Search-Warrant , and went with the High Constable to the Turk's-Head Alehouse , in the Road leading to Islington . I asked where the Landlord and Landady were ; a Woman said , I am Landlady . The Constable and other Officers searched the House , to see if they could find any Weapon wherewith the Murder was committed . Q . How came you to go to this House ? Josias Lack . Because it was a House of an indifferent Character , and People suspected it : The High-Constable was going there before I saw him . Says the High-Constable to the Woman , Where is your Husband ? Says she , he is in the Country , he has been gone three Weeks . - I have no Lodgers ; there is no body in the House but my Son , and he is making a Perriwig : She would have called him down , but the Constable chose to go up ; and when he came up , the Son was mending a Coat , and the Father was shut up in a Closet . There was a Shirt lay soaking in Water , which was bloody : I believe it was in a Bason in the Room where the Father was . The Son was in another Room up two pair of Stairs . It was asked , How the Shirt came to be bloody ; and the old Woman , and all of them said , the old Man was blooded the Sunday before . - They all three said so : And when they came before the Justice , the old Man and his Son both said it was the Sunday was se'ennight before . The Shirt was brought down and looked at , and it was bloody only on the right Arm . Court . Did you look at the Arm that was bloody ? - Lack . There was a Barber there that did , and he said he had not been blooded so lately as the Sunday se'ennight before . - I did not see any Thing farther than an old Orisice : - It looked white , not red ; he seemed very much frightened , but said , he would send for the Man that blooded him , but I did not see him there . Q . Did you see the Body of your Father ? Josias Lack . Yes , there was a great deal of Violence done to him , he was very much abused ; he had thirteen or fourteen Wounds , they appeared to be Stabs . There was one on his Left-side , under his Left-Pap ; one in his Throat ; one under his Right-Ear ; one in his Left-Cheek ; another by his Left-Eye ; another in his Left-Arm , and one or two in his Back . - It was about 10 o'Clock at Night on Monday , Aug . 16 . He worked at the Tower , and was going home to Islington . I was called out about 11 o'Clock , and the Body lay in the Road about six or seven hundred Yards from the Turnpike . - He had no Wound on the Right-Arm . Court . You say , the old Man said he would send for the Person that blooded him . Did he send ? Josias Lack . He said he would ; and that the Person lived on Little Saffron-Hill , by Hockley in the Hole : but he did not come . Ralph Coster . Did not I send for the Barber ? My own Daughter went for him , and brought him ; and you staid so long in the Mulberry-Garden , that he went away again . Lack . I did not see any body sent for . John Noel . On Tuesday the 17th of August , the High-Constable sent for me to get a Search-Warrant from Justice Wroth , to search Houses who harbour People of bad Reputation . The first House we went into was the Turk's-Head ; the Prisoner at the Bar kept the Turk's-Head at that Time ; when we went in , the Woman was asked , Who kept the House : Then she was asked where her Husband was , she said , he had been out of Town three Weeks or a Month . The High-Constable asked her , if she had got any Lodgers , or any body else in the House . She said , there was no body in the House but her Son , and that he was above Stairs , making of a Perriwig . The High-Constable bid her call him down , and she said she would ; but before she called him down , said one of the Constables , let us go and see what he is doing of ; so I went up Stairs : he was at work , but I can not tell whether it was upon a Perriwig or a Coat . Then Mr Body , the next Witness , said , here is a Man in the Closet . The Door was shut to , and I thought it was a Door that went into another Room , and there the old Man was bolt upright in the Closet - It had no Window , but was big enough to put a Close-stool , or a two-armed Chair in ; and Mr Body pulled him out , and then somebody searched to see if there were any Weapons , but did not find any ; there was a Shirt in a Pan or a Bason of Water , or Urine : I have got the Shirt here . It was the Left-Arm then that appeared to be bloody , for the Shirt was turned . I did not see it when it was taken out of the Pan ; it was delivered me before the Justice . N. B . The Shirt was produced , and appeared to be bloody about half way up the Sleeve for the Right-Arm . Q . When the Shirt was produced , how did they behave ? John Noel . The old Man seemed to be very much frightened , and said , he had been blooded the Sunday before , and that the Shirt was put in Water to soak the Blood out . - I do not know whether the Arm was inspected at the House . Thomas Coster . The Arm was inspected at the House . John Noel . I saw the Arm stripped before the Justice . There did not appear to me to be any thing of a new Orisice ; when he was examined before the Justice , he said it was the Sunday was se'en-night before that he was blooded ; he said the Person that blooded him was a Barber , who lived on Saffron-Hill . Court . Explain yourself as to the Father 's being frightened . Noel . He seemed to be in a Flurry , as if he did not know what he said . Q . How did the young Man behave ? Noel . He said he knew nothing at all of the Matter , and said he would go very quietly with us . Q . Did you observe in the young Man any Signs of Guilt ? Noel . I did not perceive any Timidity in him , there was in the old Man . Ralph Coster . Ask him what I said , when they took me out of the Closet . Noel . I did not take you out of the Closet . R. Coster . Did not I show my Arm then ? Noel . I did not see it . Court . Lack , Was your Father stripped ? Josias Lack . My Father was not stripped , he was robbed - of a Tobacco-Box , an old Knife , and a Key ; and I believe he had about him , between twenty and thirty Shillings , which was lost . Noel . The Justice desired us to try who the Shirt would fit , and it was tried on the old Man 's Wrist , and it would not meet by half an Inch at least , I believe it would hardly meet with a Pair of Buttons . Coster . These are the Buttons I had in the Sleeves when I wore it . Noel . There were no Buttons produced before the Justice : He said there , the Shirt was given him by a Nephew , and he had only wore it that Day ; and that it was to be altered and made fit for him . - There is no Mark at all upon it - The Son said he was a Perriwig Maker by Trade . - There were two or three Razors in the Room , and two or three Staves that they weave their Hair upon . - It looked as if it had been a Room that a Barber had made use of , but not lately , for the Things did not stand in Order for working . William Body . I went with a Search-Warrant , by the High Constable 's Order , to the Turks-Head . Said the High-Constable , Body , come in along with me . Said he to a Woman that was there , Who keeps this House ? Said she , I do . He asked who was in the House , she said I have no Body in the House but my son , and he is at Work . - I did not hear her ask 'd where her Husband was . I went first into the one Pair of Stairs Room on the Left-Hand and found nothing ; and then into the one Pair of Stairs Room on the Right-Hand . I went into the other Room again , and saw a Button to a Closet-Door , which was not buttoned . I went to open the Door , but I believe he held it within , because it did not open immediately . Q . Was there any thing on the inside , by which he might hold it ? William Body . It was a common Wainscote framed Door , and a Body might lay hold of the Frame with one 's Finger . - I believe it was plain on the Inside . - I did not see any thing of the Inside , that it might be hold by , - it might stick a little . My Lord , when I opened it , there was a Man stood upright in the Closet ; said I , What do you do here ? Come out . - I was led a little , for I had no Stick nor any Weapon . The old Man said , I am afraid of Bailiffs , that is the Reason of my hiding myself , I am afraid of nothing else . His Shoes were slipped , - they took the old Man down Stairs . - The young Man was mending a Coat , and he said , My Mother keeps the House , I am not afraid of any thing , What is the Meaning of this ? Said they , there is a Murder committed , and this is a Search-Warrant , and you must go along with us ; said he , I will follow you down . I thought it best that he should go first , and he readily did so . - The Sleeve of the Shirt lay in a Bason of Water , and the Body lay out of it . The High-Constable said it was requisite to take the Shirt along with us , so I went up Stairs and fetched it down . Q . How did the old Man behave then ? William Body . I did not see him any more surprized when he saw the Shirt than he was before . At first he said he was blooded the Sunday before , so did his Wife , and so did his Daughter . - His Arm was stripped up before the Justice , and there was a Man that came from Islington that bleeds People , and he said he was sure he had not been blooded for a great while . Jury . Did you hear that the Person that blooded him had been at the Justice 's ? Body . I did hear it said , that the Surgeon that blooded him , had been at the Justice 's , and that he was gone , but I did not see him . R. Coster . I know no more of it than the Child unborn . This is the Barber that blooded me . Joseph Chandler . I am a Barber , and Perriwig-Maker , and Bleeder . On the 8th of August , that old Gentleman at the Bar came to me to Saffron Hill , to be blooded , between eight and nine in the Morning , and I blooded him in the Right-Arm . Q . Did you go before the Justice ? Chandler . I was informed , that I was sent for twice , but I was abroad . Q. I would ask you if a Man has been let Blood eight or ten Days , whether the Orifice will look red or white ? Chandler . Sometimes it will look red for a Fortnight ; sometimes it may hardly be seen at all , but will close immediately ; sometimes it will be three or four Days , and in eight or nine Days it will look as if it was an old Bleeding . I knew the old Man before he lived there , he kept a House at the Spaw . Ralph Coster . I have Witnesses to prove that my Son and I were in Bed that Night by nine o'Clock . But the Court and Jury being satisfied , they were not examined . Acquitted . 97 , 98. Mary Swinhy and Jane Biller , of St George 's Middlesex , were indicted with Mary Merrit , not yet taken , for assaulting Winifred Owen on the King 's High-Way , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Handkerchief , an Apron , a Hat , and 17 s. in Money , her Property , Aug. 15 . Winifred Owen . I sell Milk . Last Sunday was three Weeks , between nine and ten in the Morning , as I was going homeward , towards Stepney , in Rag-Fair , I think they call it , I met with these Women , and asked them the Way to the Blue Anchor , they said they would show me : We went about three or four Stones throw together ; then they shoved me into an Alley , and gave me a Blow on the Head . Prisoner Miller . Gentlemen , I desire they may be all turned out of Court , and examined seperately , which was granted . Owen . The Blow stunned me , ( she is not taken that gave me the Blow , there were five of them ) then I said , Lord , have Mercy upon me , What is this for . I clapped my Hand upon my Pocket in a Minute , and caught that little one 's Hand ( Miller 's ) in my Pocket . Said I , Lord , bless me , all my Money is gone ; then one snatched my Apron off , and another my Handkerchief , and another snatched my Hat ; the 17 s. in Money was tied up in a Rag . Miller . My Lord , please to ask her whether she was drunk or sober . Owen . I drunk ! I thought I should have been murdered . God keep me from such People . So I run away , crying , into a little House , for to save my Life . I went to my Sister , and told her of it , who lives just by ; and some of the People said , they knew that little short Body , and she was taken up directly . I went to the Watch House , and they asked me if I knew her ? Yes , said I , that is the Woman that put her Hand in my Pocket . Said I , What have you done with my Money ? She cursed and swore , and abused me sadly , and struck me before the Justice . I thought she would have killed me , and the Justice ordered her to be tied down . My Handkerchief was found upon her . Q . Are you sure Swinhy was there ? Owen . Yes and please you , my Lord , God bless you , I know her very well ; the little one had a black Eye then ; 't is pretty well now : That Handkerchief is mine , I worked very hard for it , and that Hat and Apron are mine . Miller . Ask her if she did not ask for a Dram , and if I did not resent her having one . Owen . I did not call for any Liquor , God bless you , and please you , my Lord , it is she , if I was to die this Minute , God bless you . - That Woman in the blue Knot , [ which was Swinhy ] she was in Company , but I can not say she did what the others did ; - She did not take any thing from me . - I am sure the little one robbed me ; God Almighty bless you , I would not tell a Lye for the World : They snatched behind me , and did it so quick , I can not tell who did it . Joseph Williams , Constable . I was charged with this Woman to carry her to Prison ; this Hat , Apron , and Handkerchief were delivered me before the Justice . Thomas Butler . The Prosecutrix came to my House , I am her Sister 's Husband , and sat about Half an Hour one Sunday in the Morning . - Some time after she went away , I met her full butt between nine and ten , she was crying , and said she had been robbed by four Women , two small ones , a lusty one , and a middle sized one : I heard a Man say he saw four or 5 Women together talking about dividing some Money ; I happen 'd to go into the Black-Horse , in Well-Street , and there I saw Jane Miller ; she was selling the Handkerchief ; then I took fast hold of her , and she put the Handkerchief into her Bosom , then I took her to the Watch-house , and charged Williams the Officer with her ; he kept her in Custody , and then Eleanor Okley was taken , and she made her self an Evidence : Swinhy was taken up upon her Evidence by Inwin and Harris : A Woman came to me with the Apron and Hat , and said , I had these from the Woman that took them from your Sister-in-Law . - I saw Miller take the Handkerchief out of her Bosom , and gave it to another Woman , and that Woman gave it to me : When Swinhy was taken , she said , she was along with them when they went to sell the Goods , but she had no Hand in the Robbery . - Jane Miller told me , she did not drink any Gin in the Prosecutrix 's company . Owen . I drank no Gin with them that Morning , nor never saw them before in my Life . Miller . Pray , Sir , did not he pull me all along ? Williams . I bid him pull you along because you would not go . Eleanor Okley . Jane Miller , Mary Swinhy , Mary Merrit , and myself , went one Sunday Morning to get a Dram at the New Exchange in Rag Fair , and we happened to meet this good Woman , the Prosecutrix , and she asked for the Blue-Anchor . Jane Miller made answer , come along with us and we will show you , we all four of us went along with her ; when we came into the back Lane , Jane Miller , first and foremost took off her Hat ; secondly , she took off her Handkerchief , which was upon her Neck . Mary Merrit gave the Woman the Blow on the side of her Head , then Jane Miller was trying to take off her Apron ; then Mary Merrit came again , and between them both they untied it , and then we all run away . - I did not see any Body put their Hand into her Pocket - as for the Money I know nothing of it , nor never saw any ; I had no intent to rob any Body when I went out in the Morning , and I believe they had not neither - we drank no Gin with the good Woman , we had Gin before . Jury . Were you sober , or were you in Liquor ? Okley . We were not in Liquor , for we had but Half a Quartern a-piece . Swinby was with us , but she did nothing . - I went and left them , and heard no more of it till Miller was in the Cage . - Miller put the Handkerchief into her Bosom , the Hat and Apron Mary Merrit had . Miller . Ask her if she was not at Mrs Bun 's drinking Gin with the Prosecutrix . Eleanor Okley . I did not drink any thing with the Prosecutrix ; I was not in any House with her . Miller 's Defence . I was going down Rag-Fair , Okley stood at the End of an Alley with Mary Merrit , they asked me to go to the New Exchange to drink a Dram ; then I met the Prosecutrix , Okley took hold of her , said she , you shall drink a Dram , she said she did not care for a Dram for she had drank enough already : This Woman [ that 's Swinby ] and Bun 's Daughter , went after the Woman , and brought her into a Gin-shop ; then Swinby was sitting with her Mistress 's Child upon her Lap : I being a little Body like Eleanor Okley , they swear against me : Okley put her Hand in her Pocket and took out only seven Farthings , said I who must pay for the five Quarters of Gin ; and then I took her Handkerchief off her Neck to pay for it : Okley made herself an Evidence against me , for fear I should be an Evidence against her ; but I had no such Intention , because I knew it was a wrong thing . Okley . I do not know that Miller said any thing to the Prosecutrix , when she took the Handkerchief , that she did it to pay herself for five Quarterns of Gin . Jane Miller , guilty of the Felony , but acquitted of the putting in Fear . Mary Swinby Acquitted . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 99.

Mary West deposed . That she found the 2 Gowns , and several other Things of her Mistress 's at Mr Simmonds 's the Pawnbroker 's . Mr Simmonds . The Prisoner brought these things to me to pawn , she said they were her own Cloaths , and wanted 4 Guineas on them ; said I , these Cloaths do not look to be your 's , they do not fit you , she said she lived over the way , I would have sent my young Man with her to know where she lived , but she would not let him go , then I had a stronger Suspicion , and sent for Mr Harper the Constable ; the Prisoner said she was undone , and owned they were her Mistress 's Cloaths ; and confess 'd she open 'd her Drawers and took them out . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 100.

Acquitted . 101. Edward Rhodes Aris , of St John Wapping , was indicted , that he , with William McBride , not yet taken , did steal and carry away , twenty-nine Pieces of Foreign Gold Coin , called Moidores , out of a certain Ship called the Archibald , the Property of Persons unknown , July 23 . Mr Crawford ( the Owner of the Ship ) produced an Examination taken by Justice Dennet , and signed by the Prisoner , wherein he says that William Mc Bride brought a Box on Shore , which was very heavy , and had a great deal of Gold in it , and that he gave this Examinant thirty-five Moidores of the Money . The Indictment being laid for stealing them , which could not be proved , he being at most only guilty of receiving them , knowing them to be stole , he was acquitted . 102. William Bird , late of the Parish of St Martin in the Fields , in the County of Middlesex , Labourer , was indicted , for that he on the Sixteenth Day of July , in the Sixteenth Year of his Majesty 's Reign , about the Hour of two in the Morning of the said Day , with Force and Arms , in and upon one Mary the Wife of John Maurice , did feloniously , wilfully , and with Malice aforethought , make an Assault ; and that he , the said William Bird , into a certain Close-Room , called the Hole , being Part of the Building belonging to St Martin 's Round-House , she said Mary Maurice , with Malice aforethought , did force , put , place , confine , and continue for the Space of two Hours , where there were twenty Persons confined , which said Room was not of sufficient Largeness to contain twenty Persons , for the Space of one Hour , without manifest Danger of their Lives ; and that the said Mary Maurice , during the Time of her Consinement , on the Day and Year aforesaid , in the Parish and County aforesaid , and in the said Close-Room , was suffocated ; and that the said Mary Maurice , in the said Close-Room aforesaid , did die ; and that he , the said William Bird , in Manner and Form aforesaid , with Malice aforethought , the said Mary Maurice did kill and murder . He was likewise charged on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the Murder of Mary Maurice . The Prisoner desired Pen , Ink , and Paper , which was granted . The Court likewise ordered his Irons to be taken off . Bird . If your Honour pleases , I would not enter immediately into the Trial , but would desire an Hour 's Time . I am prepared with Innocence , but my Friends are not all come . [ The Trial was put off for an Hour ; when being again brought to the Bar . ] Bird . There is one Favour I beg of you , Sir John , that this poor unhappy Woman , my Wife , may have Egress and Regress . Court . She shall , and no Body shall insult either her or your Witnesses . Bird . Another Thing I beg is , that the Evidences may be examined separate . ( Which was ordered ) [ Bird then applied himself to Mr Lloyd , one of the King 's Council . ] Mr Lloyd . You will have no Hardship from any Body here . Bird . It 's hard I can have no Council ; Serjeant Hayward is out of Town ; Serjeant Wynne is out of Town ; Mr Benny and Mr Theed desired to be excused . Mr Glanville has given his Brief to one Mr Spiltimber , and he has returned it . King 's Council . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury . I am Council with the Gentleman who open 'd the Indictment against the unhappy Prisoner at the Bar , and you find that the Crime , with which he is charged , is of no less a Size than the heinous one of Murder . It falls to my Share to lay before you the particular Facts on which that heavy Charge is grounded , which I will choose to do with all the Plainness I can possibly use , and without any Comments or Observations upon them , 'till I have open 'd the whole , that so the naked Story may be considered by you in one uninterrupted Light , and the Application of the several Facts to our Law arising upon them , may be the more clearly understood . I always look 'd on Plainness to be the best , or however the honestest , Eloquence ; putting false Colours on Facts is ever unjust , but in Cases where wretched Men are on their Trial at the hazard of their Lives , 't is not only unjust but cruel ; and as the Case now to be laid before you is stated to me in my Instructions , were I ever so desirous and able to use colouring , the Facts are too black of themselves to admit of any additional Horror . Gentlemen , the Prisoner at the Bar has lived some Time in a Place called the Round-House , in St Martin's-Lane ; and has for a considerable Time ( some Years ) acted as a sort of Goaler , and disposed of such Persons as were brought thither in such Manner as he thought proper ; this Round-House consists of several Rooms . On the 16th of July last , very early in the Morning , a Number of People were brought at different Times to this Round-House , I suppose by proper Officers , amongst which the poor unfortunate Woman , whose Death gives you the Trouble of this Day , was one . - Many of them were , as they were brought thither , put by the Prisoner into a Place called the Hole , being under Ground , and about six Foot six Inches in Length , six Foot three or four Inches in Breadth , and about the same Dimensions in Height : I am instructed to say that some who thought proper to spend Money in the House , or to purchase Beds , had more Indulgence than the others , how that Fact may come out I ca n't say ; the Common-Sewer runs underneath Part of this Hole ; towards the Street was an Iron Grate which let in some Light and Air , to which there was a Shutter to be put to on Occasion , and through which were several little Slits where some little Air might come when the Shutter was put to , and there was likewise a cut over the Door which served to let in Light and Air ; the Closeness of the Place , and the Stench within it , caused by its Situation , and by the Increase of the Number of People put in at different Times , occasioned a general Cry of Murder from the poor Wretches within it , they begg 'd for Water , for Air ; called out that several were in Fits , but without Relief ; the Clamours of their Complaints reach 'd the Prisoner 's Ears , but not his Heart , for my Instructions lead me to say , that he not only refused Relief himself , but hindred others who would have afforded it ; for as a Woman was coming to bring them some Water , he push 'd her away , spilt the Water , and took away the little Resource of Air which they had , by closing the Shutter - three more Women were brought to the Round-House , and the Prisoner order 'd the Beadle to carry them into this Hole , but on his Return from it , he told the Prisoner that 't was impossible , that the Hole was too full already , and that if they had not more Air they would die . The Prisoner immediately carried the three Women down himself , and on his Return , told the Beadle , what you said could not be done , I have done in a Minute ; soon after the Prisoner went to his Bed , and this Hole was no more open 'd , till ten in the Morning , and when it was open 'd 't is impossible to describe to you the dismal Scene ! Some gasping , and , to Appearance , expiring ; some recovered who were taken for dead or dying , by the Aid of the Surgeons ; others expired on the opening a Vein , and the poor Woman , for whose Death this Prosecution is carried on , was quite dead . Having thus briefly and plainly open 'd to you the Nature of the Facts , which my Instructions lead me to say will be proved by the Witnesses , I shall take up but a little more of your Time by a few Observations , and which I shall submit to the Direction of the Court . Two Things are necessary to constitute the Crime called Murder ; first , an unlawful killing ; secondly , a malicious Intent at the Time of committing it . And here you 'll observe , that I am supposing the Facts to be true , as I have opened them , for if the Witnesses do not prove them , all that I shall say , or have said , ought to pass for nothing . First then , As to the unlawful killing , I always took it , that the Constable is the proper Officer to confine Persons committed or carried to the Round-House ; and I am informed , that the Prisoner was not properly a Constable , and if so , then most certainly all he did was unlawful ; but as he has acted for a considerable Time in this Capacity , and has been deemed the Officer , perhaps it would be too hard in this capital Way , to take Advantage of the Want of Legality in his Office . I will therefore suppose him the proper Goaler , I will suppose the Persons lawfully committed to his Custody , I will suppose all legal to the Time of putting them in the Hole , and yet it will appear that the killing was unlawful . The End of all Commitments to Round-Houses is , that the Prisoners should be safely kept for the Examination of a proper Magistrate , they are there , as in all other Prisons , in the Custody of the Law , they are sent thither to be preserved for a proper Judicatory , not to be destroyed ; and the Goaler is by Law obliged to treat his Prisoners with all the Care , and Tenderness too , which is fitting and possible . The Law abhors Cruelty , and has an Officer of its own , the Coroner , to enquire into the Death of Prisoners , left they should have met their Fate by cruel Treatment ; in which Case , the Law adjudges the Goaler guilty of Murder : He , by Force of the Law , is to keep , not to destroy his Prisoners ; supposing therefore , this poor Woman lawfully in the Custody of the Prisoner ; yet , if the Facts opened shall be proved to you , she died unlawfully , so that in such Case , here is the first Thing requisite , an unlawful killing . The second Ingredient in Murder , is a malicious Intent at the Time of committing it . Malice and Hatred are very different Things : Hatred is a Temper of Mind antecedent to the Fact ; but Malice may be a sudden Intent , and expressed at once ; thus killing another on a sudden Quarrel , with a dangerous Weapon , is Murder , for the Weapon shews the malicious Intent . In several Acts the Law implies Malice ; but in this Case there is no Occasion for implied Malice , for the Acts shew express Malice ; if he heard their Cries , or was told by the Beadle of the Danger , Why no Relief ? To what else can be imputed one Expression of his , which I am instructed be used , Let them die and be damned . Thus , Gentlemen , I have gone through what I proposed ; the Man is to be tried by you ; to your Judgment and Impartiality the Evidence to be given must be submitted . You will try him by Witnesses , not by Words ; and judge of his Guilt or Innocence , not from what we say within , or others without , but from what shall be sworn here ; and if we who prosecute fail in Proof , God forbid the Man should suffer ; but if the Facts are proved , surely the Prisoner can not have any just Claim to your Pity .
