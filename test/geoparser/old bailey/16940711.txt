But then the Prisoner called for his Defence almost half the Town of Islington that knew him very well , who gave a good Character of him , and a very bad Report of Mr. Wallpoole 's Maid , and it seem 'd to look as if the Maid was the Thief more than the Prisoner , for he did not fly for it ; it was a long Tryal , but the Jury having heard the matter particularly debated on each side , found that the Prisoner was not guilty . Charles Pynes was tried for killing one Daniel Roberts , Taylor , with a Sword , value 2 s. giving him a Mortal wound near to his left Pap of the breadth of one Inch , depth eight Inches , on the 14th day of May , in the Third Year of the Reign of Their most Sacred Majesties , King William and Queen Mary .

That he never saw such times in his Life , Men were so poor . Then the said Roberts came by , and Pynes fell upon him , and drew his Sword , and kill 'd him ; after this he went to Tovey 's House , and took a Bible , and made him swear , That he would never discover the Murder as long as he lived . Being asked , why she did not discover the Murder in all this time ; she said , she was afraid that her Husband , or some of Pynes 's Associates should Murder her ; but he being Executed last Sessions , she thought fit now to divulge it . A third witness was Ann Butler , who declared upon Oath , That the Prisoner confest to her , that he kill 'd the Man in Lincolus-Inn Fields , but did not name Roberts ; and that Mrs. Tovey met Pynes before the last Execution ; and they fell out , she telling him , That she would now swear the Murder of Capt . Shooter and Roberts against him ; he made her an Answer thus , You may if you will , for I have a Pardon in my Pocket , and I care not what you do , or to that effect ; but then the Examination of Ann Tovey was read in Court , which set forth , that Pynes cofest to her , that he had kill 'd one Roberts , a Taylor , in Lincolns-Inn Fields ; and she swore in Court , that she saw him commit the Fact . So he was found guilty of the Murder . He was a second time tried with Robert Adderton , for the Murther of Capt . Shooter , about three years ago . The Evidence was Tovey and Butler , as in the former Tryal , who said , that Adderton did confess to have done the Murther ; and Pynes said that he was with them quarrelling about a Silver-hilted Sword , who should have it , casting Lots for it , which fell upon Robert Adderton , who wore the said Sword . This was the Evidence as to this Indictment . Pynes denied the Fact . Adderton said , that Tovey went by the Name of Williams heretofore , and was condemned once , and that they swore out of pure malice ; that did not avail them . They were both guilty of Murther .

The two Women were in the melting Room , and Wilkinson was in the next Room , but nothing suspicious in his custody ; whereas in the Womens there was found a Bag of Clippings , and about 10 l. newly Clipt . Another Witness , one Mrs. Pickering , swore that she was wont to lie in the House , and then she saw Mr. Wilkinson and his wife Clip money several things , which was about two years ago . And being ask 'd , why she conceal 'd it so long ; she said it was , because her Husband , one Mr. Pickering , was concerned with them , and therefore she was afraid to discover them . She swore further , That Mr. Wilkinson told her , that he had so much broad money , that he wanted persons to Clip it , and ask 'd her to help them to Clip ; so she did , whereby she had the opportunity to see them at work ; and that she was to have 6 d. in the pound for Clipping the said broad money . Mr. Wilkinson said in his defence , that Malson brought the Bag of Clippings into his House , and that he knew nothing of it ; that the Witness was an ill Woman , and went by several Names , no less than Eight . But the Court replied , that she did not deny that ; and that he was wont to buy stolen Goods of her , that her Confederates had got unlawfully ; particularly , several that Pickering gave her , who is now a Convict in Leicester Gaol , for which Mr. Wilkinson was tried heretofore , and had the Fortune to be acquitted . The Evidence being plain and positive against Mr. Wilkinson and his wife they both were found guilty of High-Treason ; but none could swear that Matson was a Clipper , only had Cuppings in her custody , which was not enough to convict her : so she had the good Luck to escape , and was acquitted .

Mouth was stopt with Rags too , but not so full as to choke her , and that there was a Cry of Murder . Other Evidence that were there , found Madam Le-grand 's Neck tied fast to a Chair , twisted with a Stick drawn through the Chair , which was a most barbarous and ugly sight to behold . As to Butler it was sworn , That he and three more were seen near Madam Le-grand 's Door , a little before the Murther and Burglary was committed ; and the Sword that was found lying under the Old woman , was the same Sword that one of them had by his side : But there being a Flaw in the Indictment , it was altered , and they were again Arraigned after in the Afternoon , together with Francis Jewster , for the Murther of the said Madam Le-grand , as also for the Robbery . The Evidence was again repeated , as before , and it was very positive as to Butler , that he was the man that came first into the House , and made the Offer to the said Le-grand , about the compounding of the Bond . He would have proved he was in another place at the same time , but could not . John Jewster denied that he was there ; but the Evidence was positive that he was walking to and fro before the Door , as if he stood to watch or keep Guard . And being told how that Madam Le-grand was murdered , he replied to them , Hold your Tongue , for there is Money enough . There was no Evidence positive as to Frances Jewster , but presumptive ; so the Jury acquitted him both of the Murther and Robbery , but Butler was found guilty of both ; and John was found guilty of Felony only , but not of the Murther .

Week , Meat , Drink , Washing and Lodging , to go out and change Money for her ; and that she would knock any Man on the Head with her Shears , that should come up Stairs to take her for she had as well be hang 'd for Murder , as for Clipping .
