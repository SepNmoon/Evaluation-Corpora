She further said , That at the first Time of their robbing her in David Harvey 's House , she had a Person to stand by her ; which , when John Eaton saw , he fetch 'd a Press-Gang , and carried him off . She then troubled the Court with an incoherent Harrangue of her pawning her Rings to discharge some Debts she had contracted , and the Prisoners at the Bar being concerned in the making away the said Rings , & c. She then call 'd several Witnesses , to prove that the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment were her 's , and that the Prisoners at the Bar had them without her Consent ; but their Depositions not concurring with each other , they had no other Effect than to prove that the Whole was a misterious Labyrinth , and that both the Prisoners and the Prosecutor were a contentious malicious People . The Evidences for the Prisoners confirm 'd the same , there not being two of them who agreed in their Depositions ; however , it appear 'd to the Court , that the Prosecutor had put the Prisoners at some Expence at Bristol , that they had been at Charges on the Road to London , on her Account , and that she had acknowledg 'd herself indebted to them ; and furthermore , that she consented to the Pawning of some of those Goods with which she charged the Prisoners : Upon the Whole , the Jury acquitted them .

The Constable depos 'd , That when they were brought to the Watch house , Mary Harvey charg 'd Wilcox , and Wilcox charg 'd Mary Harvey , each complaining of the Wrong they had suffer 'd ; but this Deponent did not discover , by any Marks of Dirt , or otherwise , that Wilcox had been knock 'd down . This was likewise confirm 'd by the Deposition of George Smith . Mary Harvey said in her Defence , That there having been several Disputes in Law between them , Wilcox had done this out of Malice ; to prove this , she produc 'd an Evidence , who swore directly , that Henry Wilcox offer 'd her five Guineas , if she would swear that Mary Harvey robb 'd him of 11 Guineas and an Half ; but she knowing nothing of the Matter , would not be tempted to forswear herself .

James Wood depos 'd , That the Prisoner had persuaded him to sell the Mohair for him , and that at several Times he had receiv 'd a considerable Quantity of Mohair of him , and sold it to Mr. Sidebottom ; but the Prisoner saying it was Sir Randolph 's , this Deponent wanted to see Sir Randolph , to know the Certainty of it ; though to oblige the Prisoner , he told Mr. Sidebottom he had it from a Mate of a Ship , who brought it from beyond Sea , but by the Care of Mr. Sidebottom , the Prisoner was detected , and by the Jury found guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.
