On Sunday , between five and six in the Evening , I went to Mr. Forster 's Lecture in the Old Jury . There was a great Crowd ; and soon after I got into the Pew , I felt in my Pocket , and mist my Purse in which I had ten Guineas . Prisoner . By the virtue of your Oath , are you sure you had the Money before you came into the Crowd ? Mrs. Gibbons . I am sure I had it in my Pocket at noon , and I never pulled it out afterwards . Mascal Brockelsby . I went to the Lecture about five . As soon as I was seated , I took notice of the Prisoner 's going two or three times up and down the Stairs . whisking about , and looking over the Pews . He had got a Handkerchief under his Wig , and another about his Neck , and a third round his right Wrist . Mrs. Gibbons coming to the Pew , the Prisoner crowded up to her , and as she turned her Coat aside to get in , I saw him put his Hand towards her Pocket , and then he turned about and went towards the Pulpit . Mrs. Gibbons missing her Purse , I told her , I suspected the Prisoner . He was then got somewhere out of my sight , but the Clerk and I went to look for him , and in ten or twelve Minutes we met with him going out at the Door , and a Woman in a Scarlet Cloak holding by his Arm . We carried him into the Vestry , where he took four Guineas , and 4 s. 6 d. in Silver , and three Half-pence out of his Pocket , but refused to deliver it to the Constable , for he swore he knew better . Constable . The Prisoner shew 'd us the Money , but wou 'd not deliver it - He had three or four fresh Wounds in his Head under the Handkerchief , and likewise Wounds in his right Wrist . We asked him how he came by those Wounds , and he told us they were given him by his Wife . We enquired where he lived . He refused to satisfy us , but damn 'd us , and gave us very opprobious Language . John Cotterel . I saw the Prisoner and two other Fellows , and a Woman in a Scarlet Cloak , and Black Hood . By their Behaviour I took 'em to be Confederates . They made several Stops to hinder the People from passing , and they frequently wink 'd upon one another . The Prisoner went two or three times into the Gallery . He and the Woman crowded up to the Lady as she was going into the Pew ; and they both stoop 'd thus , towards her Pocket . Mr. Brotherton . I took notice of the Prisoner 's whisking to and fro in the Isle , and soon after I heard that Mrs. Gibbons had lost her Purse . The Prisoner being carried into the Vestry , I asked him if he had any Friends that he could send for , to his Reputation . He said he knew what he had to do , and he would send for no Friend . Somebody asking him what he came thither for ; he said he came for his Diversion . He treated us all with a great deal of scurrilous Language . William Butler . I took particular notice of the Woman who was with the Prisoner , because she was once at my Shop with another Woman whom I took up for a Shop-lifter - When the Prisoner was in the Vestry , I told him , if he had any Friends to send for , I would go and fetch them . He swore if he had me in a proper Place , he would knock my Head off my Shoulders . Prisoner . I had good reason to give 'em ill Language when they falsly accused me with being a Thief . Patrick White . I have known the Prisoner three or four Years . He is a Journey-Man Glover .

About Eleven at Night I met Jenny Anslow ; Sir , says she , It 's very cold , will you give me a Dram ? Aye , says I , Will you go to a Brandy shop ? No , says she , We ca n't have an Opportunity at a Brandy-shop , but at my Lodging in Old-Bedlam we may . So I went with her , and when we came to the Door , Ann Thomas , her Landlady let us in , and we went up Stairs . I gave her Landlady 6 d. to fetch a Dram , and then Jenny and I sat down together , and she making very free with my Breeches , got my Watch away before I was aware : But as soon as I mist it , I charged her with picking my Pocket ; upon which , Ann Thomas and Hannah Low came in and rescued her , and so they all ran out of the House . The Watch-man coming his Rounds , I called him in , and told him my case , and he called a Constable ; we searched two or three Houses in the Neighbourhood , and at last we met with 'em all three ; and the Constable found my Watch under Jenny Anslow 's Arm-Pit . The Constable confirmed the finding the Watch . Jane Anslow . This Man met me , and would needs go home with me , whereof when I came home , he said , he would give me a Crown to oblige him . He pull 'd out half a Guinea and bid me give him Change , but I told him I could not ; and then he said he 'd leave me his Watch in pawn ; but when I had obliged him , he wanted his Watch again without any Money ; whereof I told him , I could not afford to work for nothing ; especially , as I had taken so much Pains , for I wore out a Bunch of Rods before I could make any thing of him . The Jury found Anslow guilty to the value of 10 d. and acquitted the other two . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 10.

Elizabeth Ambrook , was indicted for the Murder of her male Bastard Infant , by throwing it , as soon as born , out of a Window 2 Stories high , in the House of William Ambrook , upon the Tiles covering a Shed adjoining to the said House , and thereby giving the said Bastard one Mortal Bruise on the left Side of the Head , of which mortal Bruise he instantly dyed , December 28 . She was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Samuel Cook . Standing at my Garden-Door in Crown-Alley in upper Moorfelds , on Saturday , about four in the Afternoon , I heard the Noise of a Window clapping to ; upon which I went into the Garden and saw something lye upon Mr. Clark 's Shed which joins to William Ambrook 's House . I could not guess what it was , but I poked it down and laid it in the Alley , and then I perceiv 'd that it was a New-born Child . I believe there was some Life in it , for I thought I saw the Body move . Several People came round it presently , and I staid four or five Minutes , or perhaps a Quarter of an Hour , and then it was taken away , and as I understood , was carried to the Watch-house . It was a Male Child . There is a Window over the Shed where I found the Child . Ann Ambrook . The Prisoner is my Husband 's Sister . She came to our House about Noon , and said she was extreamly ill for want of a Stool . I gave her some Stuff to make her go to stool , and then undrest her , and put her to Bed . I went up two Hours after , and found her standing upright in the Bed with her two Arms thus . She said she was almost distracted for want of a Stool - I went up again at half an Hour past three , and then she said she was better and I saw no more of her till after the Misfortune ; for about four I heard that a Child was flung out of the Window , but I did not go to see the Child till Monday , and then I saw it in the Watch-house . Nor did I go up to the Prisoner till the Constable came , and that was about five o'Clock . I found things in a disorderly Condition , with the Signs of a Delivery by the Bed-side . I had no Notion of her being with Child till I heard of a Child being thrown out of the Window , and then I concluded it must be hers , for the Room where she was has a Window that looks out upon the Shed where the Child was found . I asked her how she came to do such a thing , and she said , she did not know she did , for thro ' the Extremity of Pain she thought the Room was on Fire when she threw it out - Before she came to our House , she lived a Servant in the next Alley which is White-Cross Alley , with Mr. Pomeroy a Watch Maker . Peter Debrather , Constable . I am an English Man born and bred , but I have been a great many Years out of the Land , and dont very well understand English , but I will speak so well as I can . As I was into my Garden , I heard the People in the Alley , and one said , Pray come and see the Cruelness in this Alley ; so I went , and looked upon my Watch , and it was half an Hour after four , and the People surrounded me , and pull 'd me , and said , Why do n't you search for the Mother ? Whereup , I fetch my short staff , and charge this Gentlewoman , Sarah Newman , to aid and assist ; and so we went to Ann Ambrook 's Door , and she said , You need not go any further , for here it is to my Sorrow . I asked her , where ? and she told me above . Whereup , I being quicker than the Women , went up first , but I see such a Sight , that I run down so fast as I came up - and running down four or five Pair of Stairs . Court . Four or five Pair of Stairs ? Debrather . I dont know how to call it , but it was four or five Steps - and then call 'd in the two Women , Ann Ambrook and Sarah Newman , and put them forwards , and left them in the Room to take care of the Prisoner , while I went to the Church-Warden , and he brought a Midwife to the Prisoner . Joel Fremoult , Surgeon . The Church-Wardens of Shoreditch Parish sent for me to view the Child on Monday Evening ; there was a large Contusion in the left side of the Head ; I took off the Scalp , and found a large Quantity of extravastated and congeal 'd Blood ; there was no Fracture , for the Scull of so tender a Child is not properly Bone , but rather Grisle ; but there was a Prohiberance in the Scull it self where the Bruise was : which I believe was the Cause of its death . Susan Anderson . I was at Mr. Pomeroy 's House last Saturday , and there was the Prisoner 's Sister who broke open the Prisoner 's Trunk , in which we found this Child-bed Linnen . Margaret Warner . I was there at the same time , and saw this Linnen taken out . The Prisoner 's Sister and Pomeroy 's Maid produced a Key with which the Trunk was opened , but it was with a great deal to do . Susan Anderson , again . There was a Key put into the Lock , but it would not open it , and so it was forced open with a File . Then the Statute on which the Prisoner was Indicted , was read by order of Court . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . 12.

The same Day I mist the goods - And she was taken in the Hundreds of Essex . James Chevalier . On the 13th of December , by Madam Windsor 's Order , I went to search for the Prisoner in Essex , where she was well known at her Father 's House , but he said he had not seen her for a 12 Month . At last I met with her at Rochford , and upon farther Enquiry , part of the Goods and Money were found , and she confest that she took them , but had no Thought of so doing till she was put upon it by another Person .

He pretended he found it upon the Ground under the Shop-window , but it was very dirty Weather , and the Shewboard was clean , the Loops at the bottom were cut , and those at the top were torn .

Edward Bill . These are my Goods . I make 'em my self , I live in St. Martin 's Court next to Castle Street against Cranbourn Alley . The Shew-Glass stood in my Shop Window , half in , and half out . It was taken away on the seventh of January , about seven at Night . I was then at a Neighbour 's House , and hearing an Outcry , I ran to see what was the Matter , when my Wife told me we were undone , for the Shew-Glass was lost . Ann Kenring . I was standing in the Room next the Shop with the Child in my Arms . My Mistress and two more Gentlewomen were sitting in the same Room . I was looking towards the Shop Window where we had a Glass Lamp , and I saw a Man clap his Arm over the Shew Glass and take it away . So , so ! says I , You are mighty full of your Play methinks , to steal the Shew Glass : Why that 's a fair Robbery . For I thought it had been taken in jest by a Gentleman who was with my Master . But as the Man did not turn back , I begun to fear he was in earnest , and so I followed with the Child in my Arms , and cry 'd , Stop Thief . I saw him with the Glass under his Arm ; he was then no farther from me than from hence to that Chair , and he was not afterwards out of my sight till he dropt the Glass , and was taken by the Pine Apple Door in Castle-Street . I am sure that the Prisoner is the Man . I was almost close to him when he dropt it . Nicholas Byrom . As I was turning the narrow Passage from Castle-Street into St. Martin 's Court , a Man past by me with something very Combustible under his Arm . And presently , the Maid crying Stop Thief ! I turned about and saw the same Man drop something that made a great Noise under the Lamp . That Man was the Prisoner , for he was taken before he was out of my sight . Robert Prat . Coming from Charing-Cross , and turning up Castle-Street I heard a Cry of Stop Thief . It being dark I went into the middle of the Street , and stooping down , I saw the Prisoner run , and the Maid follow him . I stopt him against the Pine-Apple Eating-House , and then he cry 'd Stop Thief , and said the Thief was run before , but I told him he was mistaken . The Maid came up to us with a Child in her Arms , and bid me hold him fast for he was the Thief . And so I obliged him to turn back . I saw the Shew Glass upon the Ground , and the People were picking the Toys out of the Kennel . I led the Prisoner to the Prosecutor 's Shop , and a Constable being sent for , he came , and carried the Prisoner before Mr. Justice Deveil , who committed him to Newgate that night . The Prisoner denied the Fact , but called no Witnesses . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 26.

John Culpan . I deal in Linnen . On the twenty sixth of December , in the Afternoon , I went to the Feathers Tavern in Drury-Lane , where I sold as many Goods to Mrs. Smith , who keeps the House as came to 4 l. I went from thence about eight at Night to the next Door which is the Crown ( or Horn ) and Horse-Shoe - One John Uffard keeps the House - And there I had two eighteen Penny Bowls of Punch below Stairs , for which I paid three Shillings , and then was going away , but Rowland Kendenell , the Drawer came down to the bottom of the Stairs , and pushed me back , and demanded thirty five Shillings . Hester Cox , the Landlady , and Elizabeth Mason followed him and insisted upon the same Demand , and said , they would have it before I went out of the House . I was afraid , and thought my Life was in danger , or that they would rob me of my Goods , for I had ten Pounds worth about me ; and therefore I offer 'd Cox a Guinea to let me go away peaceably . She took the Money and went up Stairs . But the other two still insisted upon their first Demand of thirty five Shillings . I told them it was very hard , when they knew I had given Cox a Guinea . But Kendenell swore that he did not see me give her any thing ; and she coming down again , denied that she had received the Guinea . And with that they fell upon me , knock 'd me down and beat me , and Kendenell wrenched open my Hand and took out a Guinea and a half and some Silver . I cry 'd for help , and I believe they would have murder 'd me , if Mason had not desired 'em for God 's sake to beat me no more . I had seven or eight Yards of Kenting Linnen under my Coat . Kendenell took it from me , and said , Damn him , What has he got more in his Budget ? At the same time I heard a Voice above Stairs , say , Beat the Dog ! I cry 'd Murder , and call 'd for Tom Smith who lived next Door . At last I got away , and went to Tom Smith , and told him how I had been abused , and had called for him to help me . He said , he did not hear me , but if he had heard , he would not have ventur 'd in for 100 l. for they would have sworn his Life away - And Justice Mitford , who committed them , advised me not to let them know where I lived , for they were vile Creatures , and would swear any thing . Cox . Did not you bring a Woman with you into our House ? Culpan . No . Cox . I had no Money of him , but what he paid for the Reckoning - He staid till between five and six the next Morning . Patrick Macdonald , and Mary Hickembotham deposed , that one James Lewis came several times as from the Prisoners to Culpan , and offer 'd to make him satisfaction if he would not prosecute them : But the Witnesses were not sure that Lewis was employed by the Prisoners . Elizabeth Smith . The Prosecutor came to my House , the Feathers in Drury-Lane about two in the Afternoon . I bought some Sheeting , Damask Napkins , a Work 'd Petticoat of him , for which I paid him 4 l. He staid till about eight at Night , and then went to the Horn and Horse-shoe next Door . He returned about three , and cry 'd prodigiously . His Shirt was bloody and torn , tho ' it was as strong as Towelling . His Nose bled , and I wiped it with my Apron . He said , he cry 'd out for my Husband . My Husband answered , that if he had heard him he should hardly have ventured to come to his Assistance . Mason . What do you know of me ? Eliz . Smith . As for Betty Mason , she does not live at the Horn and Horse-shoe , but at Hill 's Coffee-house in Drury-Lane - She is an unfortunate Woman , that sometimes goes into Gentlemen 's Company - She has been at my House - About a Week before this happened , she was at my Bar , and said she had a good mind to make an Oath never to go into that House again - on account of some Trouble - for Cox 's Brother , John Uffard , had sent my next Door Neighbour ( who keeps a Brandy-shop ) to Goal , and swore a Robbery against him ; but this Affair of their own coming on , they thought it best to drop that Prosecution , and so they found the Bill Ignoramus . David Smith . Cox 's Brother came to me , and said , Ca n't we mitigate this Matter ? No , says I , You 're a roguish Fellow , and I wont be concern 'd in it . The Defence of the Prisoners . Frances Harris . On the twenty sixth of December , the Prisoner Mrs. Cox sent for me to Breakfast with her . And her Brother , Mr , Uffard . being out of Town , I staid with her all Day . About nine at Night , the Prosecutor came in with an ordinary mean-drest Creature , and drank a Pint or two of Wine with her at the Bar , and then they went up Stairs together . She went away in about half an Hour , and then Kendenell , the Drawer told me , that the Gentleman above , which was the Prosecutor , desired to speak with me . I went up and met him on the Stairs . He asked me to drink a Glass of Punch , and so I went in , and he and I drank four or five Bowls of Arrack Punch , which came to 20 s. and three Pints of Wine . Court . What ! did you two drink all that ? Frances Harris . Yes ; there was no body else in the Room . Court . How long did you stay with him ? Frances Harris . Till a Quarter past one in the Morning - But now I think o n't , the Maid , Eleanor Sutton , came up several times , and he made her drink with us - We had something for Supper : and after Supper I was for going home , but he said , if I would but stay with him he did not care how much he spent . He called for the Reckoning : The Drawer came up and said , there was thirty one Shillings to pay , and asked him if he would have a Bill . He said , no , it was time enough for he was not going yet - The Supper was cold Victuals that was left on Christmass-Day . There was only two Shillings for eating , and twenty nine Shillings for Punch and Wine . I went down and staid a little time in the Bar : and while I was there , he sent for several other Women , who came and went up to him ; and then I went to my Lodgings . Culpan . I never was up any Stairs in the House . If her Character was inquired into - Frances Harris . My Character ? Mind the Ignorance of the Fellow ! - Sure I think my Character will stand upon as good a footing as yours . Moses Levi , a Jew . A Gentleman in Pall-mall employed me to cut some Diamonds for him . I was going to carry my Work home between six and seven at Night , but by the way , I called in at Mrs. Cox 's , and there was she and Mrs. Mason , and the last Witness , Mrs. Harris in the Bar . I called for a Bottle of Wine to drink with them . At three Quarters past eight , the Prosecutor came in with a Woman . They drank Wine at the Bar , and then went up and called for another Pint . In half an Hour the Woman came down . and Mrs. Harris went up . They had two or three Bowls of Arrack Punch while I was there ; I staid till half an Hour past ten , and then went with my Work to Pall-mall . The Gentleman paid me 5 l. I returned to Cox 's at one o'Clock , and called for another Bottle . Mrs. Harris came down . I asked her if she had staid above with the Gentleman all that time : and she said , yes . And after that , there came down two or three Women together ; and the Prosecutor called for one and two Bowls at a time . I was then going home , but Mrs. Cox desired me to stay , because her Brother was out of Town , and she had no body to take care of the House : and so I staid till five o'Clock . The Prosecutor rung the Bell , the Drawer went up . and coming down again to the Bar , he asked what was to pay , Mrs. Cox told him 2 l. 12 s. 6 d. He went again , but presently returned , and said , the Gentleman had used him ill , and struck him . The Bell ringing again , he went up again , and when he came down he complained as before of being beat and abused . Upon which , Mrs. Cox desired me to go up with her . I consented , and she and I , -and Mrs. Mason , and the Drawer , all went up together . As soon as the Door was opened , the Prosecutor fell upon the Drawer , and gave him several Blows , and then the Drawer fell upon him , and beat him , and tore his Shirt - The Prosecutor asked what was to pay . Mrs. Cox told him 2 l. 12 s. 6 d. He gave her two Guineas and a half , and then went down to the Bar , called for a Gill of Brandy , drank and paid her fix Pence for it . He made no Complaint of a Robbery , but said , Good Morrow to ye Landlady , and so went away - And as for Linnen I saw none that he had . Eleanor Sutton . I am Servant to Mrs. Cox . At nine o'Clock the Prosecutor came in with a dirty ordinary Creature . They drank a Bottle of Wine at the Bar , and then went up Stairs . They staid a considerable time together , I believe it might be half an Hour , and then the Creature came down , and went away . And the Drawer desired this Lady , Mrs. Harris to go up to the Gentleman , and she did so . They had several Bowls of Arrack Punch , and three Bottles of Wine . I was called up several times to drink with them . I went to bed before they parted . My Bed is in the next Room to that they were in , so that I could hear what was doing - I heard her go down Stairs , and several Women come up . Between four and five in the Morning he called for a Bill . The Drawer brought it ; and he would not pay the Drawer , but assaulted him . I hearing this , got up , went into the Room and there they were fighting , and the Drawer tore his Shirt . They parted , and the Drawer went down , but soon came up again with Mrs. Cox , Mrs. Mason , and Moses Levi : And then the Prosecutor made no more scruple , but put two Guineas and a half into Mrs. Cox 's Hands . They all went together ; he drank a Gill of Brandy at the Bar , and said , Good Morrow Landlady . Court . Was there no quarrelling betwixt the Prosecutor and the Drawer at that time ? Eleanor Smith . No , not in the least . Court . Levi , swore otherwise . - Here Levi - You said that when you went up with Cox and Mason , the Prosecutor fell upon the Drawer , and they fought together . Levi . There was a Skirmish , the Prosecutor struck the Drawer , but I parted 'em . Court . What say you to that , Eleanor Sutton ? Eleanor Sutton . When the Prosecutor and Drawer quarrelled , there was no body else present , for as soon as I heard the Noise I got up and went into the Room . But when the Drawer came up with Levi , and the Prisoners , there was no Quarrel , for the Prosecutor paid the Reckoning in a very good Humour - The Quarrel was between four and five in the Morning . Elizabeth Smith , again . That is impossible , for it was but three o'Clock , or at most , a Quarter past three , when the Prosecutor came crying to my House . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 31.

He was very lame of the Palsly , and quite helpless . On Sunday the twelfth of last May , I and my Wife went out about ten in the Morning , and left only my Son and the Prisoner at home . We returned at six , and knock 'd at the Door . My Son look 'd out of Window and told us that the Maid went out about four o'Clock and took the Key with her , so that he could not let us in . We went to a Neighbour 's House where we staid ; and the Prisoner not coming by nine o'Clock , I borrowed a Ladder , and so got into the Window . My Son told me that the Prisoner went up Stairs and made a great Busling : That he called to her several times , and asked her what she was doing , and at last he heard her come down and go out . We searched , and soon found that she had rob 'd us , at which we were much surprised , for we had a very good Character of her from Mrs. Richardson , a Milliner in Paternoster-Row . I advertised the Goods . and enquired after the Prisoner ; at last I received a Letter from a Friend at Gloucester informing me that she was there , and married to one Gardner a Chimney-Sweeper .

Joseph Sharp . I saw this Cloak and Quilted Petticoat lined with blue Sattin taken from the Prisoner at the Green Dragon by Mr. Hemmings . The Cloak was first found at her Lodgings , but she desired Mr. James to let her put it on when she was going to the Dragon , and he gave her leave . She own 'd that the Cloak and Quilted Coat were her Mistress Chilton 's Goods . Prisoner . My Mistress gave me the Cloak and Gown . John Wilks .

December 14 . in the Night . Michael Mullington . I keep the three Cups in Bedford Street near Bedford Row in Holbourn . I got up about seven in the Morning , found my Cup-board wrench 'd open and mist my Plate . One Mr. Johnson came to my House to enquire for Mrs. Thomas , who lived next Door to me , and told me , that a Woman had offer 'd such Plate as he had heard I had lost , to a Pawn-broker , but he had stopt it and she was sent to St. Martin 's Round house . I went to her at last and she confest that she hid her self in my Club-Room 'till the Family was all abed , and then wrench 'd open my Cup-board , and took the Mug and Spoons from thence , and the Tankard off the Table , and then unbolted the Back-door which she left open , and so went away about four in the Morning . William Price . I live with Mr. Reynold a Pawn broker in Hart-Street , Covent-Garden . An Old Woman who lives at Mr. Johnson 's , brought this Tankard and two Spoons to me , to be pledged as from him . I stept over to Mr. Johnson , and he told me that he knew nothing of it , any farther than that it was sent by a Woman who accidentally called at his House . I carried this Account to my Master , and thereupon he refused to meddle with the Plate . Mr. Johnson came over not long after , and said she offer 'd to pawn it to him for a Guinea , and would sell it outright next Day . My Master advised him not to be concern 'd in it , but to get a Constable , and take her up upon Suspicion . Accordingly we went and stopt her as she was going away with the Plate in her Apron . She said it was given her by her Aunt Hastings who was a Captain 's Widow and lived in the Trinity Alms-houses at Mile-End . She was carried to the Round-house , and afterwards before the justice . She confest that the Plate was the Prosecutor 's and that she hid her self in his House 'till the Family was abed and then forced open the Cup-board , and took the Plate , and let her self out at the Back-doors . Mr. Tickeridge . Between twelve and one at noon , Mr. Johnson sent for me and said there was a Woman in his House that offer 'd to pawn a Tankard with him for a Guinea . I told him I suspected the Plate was stolen and advised him to apprehend her . As I was standing in my Shop she came out of his House with the Plate in her Lap . I stopt her , and said Mistress you ha n't paid your Reckoning . What do ye mean by that ? says she , you 're an impudent Fellow - She was carried before the Justice , and sent to the Round-house where the Prosecutor found her . Afterwards before Justice Hilder she confest that she conceal 'd her self in Mullinton 's Club Room , and in the Night took the Tankard off the Table , and wrench 'd open the Cupboard-door , and took from thence the rest of the Plate , and then opened the Back-door and got out between four and five in the Morning . She went by two Names , Williams and Hephourn , and she said that her Husband was a Soldier in the Scotch Guards in the Barracks at the Tower , and that he often beat her to make her do such things . John Johnson . A little before six in the Morning the Prisoner came to my House in Hart-Street . I keep a Chandler 's Shop . She called for a Quartern of Liquor and paid me three Pence for it , tho ' she did not drink a Spoonfull of it , but she had some Coffee . She complain 'd of being greatly fatigued with sitting up three Nights with her Aunt at Mile-End , and coming from thence in the Rain , for it was a very wet Morning ; but she said her Aunt had done better for her than she expected , and had left her some Plate . She shew 'd me a Silver Tankard , a Silver Mug and four Silver Spoons , and said , she wanted a little present Money upon some of them . My Servant carried the Tankard and two Spoons to Mr. Reynold , upon which she was taken up . When she was in the Round-house , I asked her if she had Friends , she said Yes , Mrs. Thomas at a Box-makers , the Corner of Gray's-Inn-Passage . I went thither , but could not find her . But I went into the Three Cups and called for a Pint of Beer , which happened to be the Prosecutor 's House . I told 'em a Woman was taken up with a Parcel of Plate which I believed to be stolen . The Landlord went with me to the Round-house . The Prisoner was carried before the Justice , and the Prosecutor swore to the Tankard , the Mug and three Spoons , but was not positive to the fourth , because he had some Plate with his Second Wife , and did not very well know the Marks of it . Upon which , the Prisoner said , They are all your 's Mr. Mullington . I hid my self in your Club-room , and when you were abed I took the Tankard off and all the rest out of the Cup-board . Prisoner . I have nothing to say , but that I have been very silly in what I have done . The Jury found her Guilty . Death . 51.

Margaret Todd . On the thirtieth of November I came away from my Service in the Meuse , and between seven and eight at Night I was going to my Lodging in St. Giles 's with my Cloaths pack 'd up in a Bundle . I saw the Prisoner first in Holborn . She followed me a little way , and then I thought I had got quit of her ; but as I was turning out of Holborn into Dumb 's Alley , she came and took hold of my Bundle and offer 'd to carry it for me . I told her there was no occasion , and so I went forward . She followed me , pushed me down three times , and when I was upon my Knees , she took away my Bundle The last time that she pushed me down I broke my Face against the Wall - Dumb 's Alley is pretty long and very narrow , and I saw no Houses that had Doors opening into it . I cryed out , and two Men coming up to me , I told them how I had been robb 'd ; they run into Holborn , and stopt a wrong Woman . But afterwards they met with a Carman , by whose means we found the Prisoner a bed in a two Penny Lodging in Fletcher 's Court , in Church-Street . She had then got my Handkerchief about her Neck though she afterwards made it away . But these other Things , the Sattin Gown , three Shifts , two Aprons . Cambrick Head Cloths , and three Caps were found in her Landlady Rebecca Butler 's Possession . The Prisoner had pawn 'd them , and Butler had redeem 'd them and bought them outright . The risoner made a Confession before Justice Mitford in Wild Court , and it was taken in Writing , but she would not sign it - I am positive that she is the Woman that robbed me . Rebecca Butler . The Prisoner ow 'd me a little Money , and told me she had pawn 'd such and such Goods at the Golden-Ball in King-Street by the Seven-Dials . She went with me to the Pawn-brokers , and I fetch 'd out these Goods on the Tuesday , and on Wednesday she was taken . John Sample . As I and James Hawkins were going to my Masters , which is four Doors beyond Dumb 's Alley , we saw the Prosecutor with a Bundle , and the Prisoner having hold of her Arm , and they went up the Alley . At the end next Holborn , a Woman past us with a Bundle under her Arm , and when we came towards the other end , we saw the Prosecutor under an Arch that leads into High-Street , Bloomsbury . Lord Master ! says she to me , the Woman has robbed me . We went afterwards to a Pawn-brokers , and from thence to Bishop 's Brandy Shop , and there we met with a Carman , who by the Description we gave of the Prisoner , said he believed he knew her . He directed us for farther Information to a Woman who carried us to the Prisoner 's Lodging . Ann Todd , Sister to the Prosecutrix . That Night as my Sister left her Service , she came home to me about eight at Night with her Face cut and very bloody , she told me she had been robb 'd , and I know these Goods to be hers . Prisoner . I found these Goods at the upper End of Dumb 's Alley , and there was no Soul in the Alley but my self when I pick 'd them up . The Jury found her Guilty . Death . 52. William Whitmore , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of Robert Dillow , and stealing twenty five Plates , two Sauce Pans , a Brass Pot , three Hats , and four Aprons , November 28 in the Night .

John Smith , of St. Dunstan in the West , in the County of Middlesex , was indicted for stealing a Linnen Bag , seven Portugal Pieces of the value of thirty six Shillings each , a Moidore , and sixteen Guineas , the Goods and Money of Nicholas Pollamounter , in the House of Mary Glascock , December 26 . The Witnesses were examined apart . Nicholas Pollamounter . On the twenty sixth of December , I took Coach in Westminister with Mr. Cornish . We were going to his House in Sheer-Lane to drink a Bowl of Punch . And just as we came out of the Coach , two Girls asked me to drink a Glass of Wine ; and I being in a good Humour , we went with them into the Angel and Crown Tavern , at the Corner of Sheer-Lane , by Temple-Bar . Mary Glascock keeps the House , and the Prisoner lives with her . We had two Bottles of Wine , and some Cakes . Mr. Cornish was with me . The Prisoner came up into our Company and drank with us . I had got eleven Portugal Six and Thirty Shilling Pieces , a Moidore and sixteen Guineas in a Bag . I pull 'd out this Bag to pay the Reckoning which was 6 s. 3 d. The two Girls were dismist . The Prisoner rung the Bell , the Door was open , and another Girl whose Name was Margaret Boucher came in . She and I went into another Room . When we had been some time together , she went away , and presently after she was gone , I mist my Bag and all my Money . I went directly to the Room where I had left the Prisoner and Cornish , and complained of my Loss . Well , says the Prisoner . Do n't make a Disturbance here , for this is a very honest House . I know the Girl , and if you 'll give me some Reward for my Trouble I 'll see if I ca n't find her , and help you to your Money again . So he and Cornish went out to look for her . The Prisoner and she returned , and Cornish follow 'd them . The Prisoner insisted upon a Discharge , and Cornish writ one . The Girl returned the Money . Cornish and the Prisoner counted it . The Prisoner received four Six and Thirty Shilling Pieces for returning it , and then I put the rest up in my Right-hand Breeches-Pocket , where I thought it would be safe . The Prisoner , besides having the four Portugal Pieces , insisted that I should call for a Bowl of Arrack Punch , which I did , and after that we had another . We were not now in the Room above where I first went with the two Girls , but in a Room below Stairs . At drinking the second Bowl , the Landlady , Mary Glascock , called Cornish out of the Room , and then there was only the Prisoner and I and Peg Bouther together . Peg went away in six or eight Minutes . And in four or five Minutes after she was gone , I mist my Money again , and begun to make a Noise about it . The Prisoner then pretended that he did not know the Girl - I had no mistrust that they would have served me so a second time - I was not very sober - nor quite drunk , because I knew Peg full well when I met with her the next Morning . But Cornish was quite sober , for he drank nothing but Water with a Toast in it , all the while he was in our Company Prisoner . Was I in the House when the Girl returned the Money ? Pollamounter . Yes , you and she were both together ? Prisoner . I am cautious of asking Questions , because I know you will swear any thing - But were not you robb 'd three times - were you not robb 'd of a Crown by one of those two Girls that came in with you ? Pollamounter . No ; I gave her a Crown freely . P. Council . What Employment are you of ? Pollamounter . None - I had an Estate in Cornwall - and this Money that I lost , I had upon a Mortgage . Hugh Cornish . Mr. Pollamounter and I coming out of a Coach at Temple-Bar , he met with two little Girls who asked him to drink . We went with them to the Angel and Crown , where he treated them with Wine and Cakes . The Prisoner came up into our Company , and said , he never saw so much Impudence as in them Girls - One of the Girls went away . Pollomounter pulled out his Bag to pay the Reckoning , which was 6 s. 3 d. The Bell was rung , and presently in came Peg Boucher , and sat by Pollamounter . In a little time he and she went out together . But he soon returned alone , and told us he had lost his Money . The Prisoner said , Be easy - I know the Girl , and I will go see for her . He went ; returned , and said he could not find her . Then he desired me to go with him , which I did . We went to a Brandy Shop in Sheer-Lane , where he drank a Dram , and then went back , and I followed . I went into a Room below Stairs , opposite to the Bar , and there was he and Peg and Pollamounter . They talk 'd of returning the Money , and a Discharge was insisted on . Peg took the Bag out of her Pocket and delivered it . The Prisoner told sixteen Guineas , a Moidore , and Six Six and Thirty Shilling Pieces at first , but afterwards there was one more of these Portugal Pieces produced , and then he cast up the whole to be 30 l. 15 s. I counted it after him , and then gave it to Pollamounter , who put it in his Pocket . This being done , we had a Bowl of Arrack Punch , but I drank nothing but Water with a Toast . In a little time I was called into the Kitchen to Mrs. Glascock , who said , she wanted to speak with me . I did not find that she had any great Business to talk about , but only to tell me how good natur 'd it was in Pollamounter to take his Money again , and be easy without prosecuting the Girl - I returned to the Room I came from , and found only Pollamounter , and the Prisoner there , for Peg was gone Pollamounter felt in his Pocket and mist his Money again , upon which , he grew very uneasy . The Prisoner endeavour 'd to set me and him at odds , by insinuating that I had got the Money . I insisted upon calling in the Watch , but the Prisoner said the Watch would not come into that House : And at the same time declared that he did not know the Girl . But she was taken next Day at his Door , and carried to the Cock Ale-house . She at first denied that she had ever seen Pollamounter , but afterwards confest that she had taken his Money , and said , she would help him to it again in a little time , for she had not got it all in her own keeping . Prisoner . Who was with you when I first came into your Room , after you had sent for Mrs. Glascock ? Cornish . I know nothing of her being sent for . But when you came up first there was Pollamounter and I and the two little Girls - You came up upon a Squabble that he had with one of them , because he had given her a Crown and he wanted it again . Prisoner . Did not he say she had robb 'd him ? Cornish . No . Prisoner . Mrs. Glascock was sent for upon this Quarrel , and I went up in her stead . Did not Pollamounter pull Peg Boucher into the Room ? Cornish . No - She came in of her self . Prisoner . Did not Pollamounter Charge you with having his Money ? Cornish No , but you did your endeavour to insinuate that I had it , and then as if he and I had been going to quarrel , you push 'd me on the Breast , and said , You sha n't sight . Pris . Were not you and he going to fight ? Cornish . No - I was going to call the Watch , but you said it was a City Watch and should not come in there . K. Council . Do ye know of any Reward the Prisoner had ? Cornish . Pollamounter complain 'd that there were four Six and Thirty Shilling Pieces wanting , but said he was willing to take what there was . Margaret Boucher , alias Smith . I was at a Brandy-Shop in Sheer Lane when Will . Jones ( who is Mary Glascock 's Porter ) came and said his Mistress wanted me . So I went to her House which is the Angel and Crown , and there I found her , and Ann , the Daughter , and Jack Smith , the Prisoner . And this Jack Smith called to me , and said Peggy ' l There 's two Gentlemen above , Pollamounter and Cornish , and Pollamounter has got a great deal of Money . Now if you can get it you shall have 6 s. out of every Guinea ; and I , and Mary Glascock and Ann the Daughter , will have a Crown a-piece . I 'll ring the Bell for a signal , and then you shall come up and introduce your self and take him into a private Room ; and when you have got the Money you shall go into this Room below - The Prisoner lives with Mary Glascock - but she is not his Wife - but - something else - So the Prisoner went up and rung the Bell , and I went in . The Prisoner pointed to Pollamounter 's right Pocket where his Money was . I asked Pollamounter to go into another Room with me , which he readily agreed to , and so we went together and there I pick 'd his Pocket , and making an Excuse to go out , I went down and into the Room the Prisoner and I had agreed upon . Mary Glascock , and Ann the Daughter presently came to me Ann the Daughter took the Bag and was going to tell the Money , but Mary Glascock . said that no body should tell it till the Prisoner came down . The Prisoner coming he told nine Six and Thirty Shilling . Pieces , Sixteen Guineas , and one Moidore . But when Mary Glascock , and Ann the Daughter told it they could make but seven Six and Thirty Shilling Pieces . Then the Prisoner and Glascock went out , and Ann the Daughter staid in the Room with me . The Drawer brought us a Gimblet with which Ann the Daughter fastned the Door within side , and blew the Candle out that Pollamounter might not find us . But in a little while the Prisoner came to the Door , and we let him in , and he told us that Pollamounter had mist his Money and made a great Noise , and threatned to suppress the House if the Money was not return 'd , and therefore , says he , you must give it him again , but you may get something of him for returning , and we will share that among us in the same manner as we agreed to share the whole . But be sure you get a Discharge , or else you may hang 'd for it , upon Jonathan Wild 's Act . So they all went out and left me in the Room , and by and by the Prisoner brought Pollamounter to me , and said , Here 's the Girl ! She only took it in Jest . Cornish came in presently after them , and then a Discharge was writ , and I return 'd the Money , but I got nothing for returning it . Then they all sat down and a Bowl of Punch was brought in - The Prisoner called me out into the Kitchen , and said , Stay , Peggy and drink him down dead drunk , and then you may get the Money again , and he wont know how he has lost it ; and we will divide it in the same proportion as we first agreed upon - Pollamounter order 'd a Chicken for Supper , and then there was another Bowl of Arrack Punch made stronger than ordinary , And this made Pollamounter quite drunk . Then Mary Glascock called Cornish out of our Company , and no body was in the Room but the Prisoner and I , and Pollamounter . Now , says the Prisoner , I believe it will do . And upon that I took the Bag of Money a second time out of Pollamounter 's Pocket , and gave it to the Prisoner who was present . He carried it to the Bar , and I followed him . He took out four Guineas ; but Cornish coming out of the Kitchen sooner than was expected , the Prisoner gave me the Bag , and what was left in it , and said , We have not time to divide it now : carry it home and burn the Bag , and we will make the Division to-morrow . So I went away , and next Day , just as I was going in at the Angel and Crown Door to make the Dividend , Pollamounter and Cornish met me , and carried me to the Cock Ale-house in Fleet-Street - While I was there , one John Drink-water came to me in the Prisoner 's Name , and said , if I did not send him the Money , it would be found upon me , and I should be hang 'd : But if I gave it to him , and then charged it upon Cornish , the whole House would swear it - While we had this Discourse , Pollamounter and Cornish were gone out of the Room , and there was no Constable , nor any body but one Man that stood at the Door - So I gave the Money to Drinkwater , to carry to Smith - From the Cock , I was carried in a Coach to the Constable 's House at the Swan , hard by Sir Richard 's - The Prisoner came thither . I went into the Kitchen and spoke to him , and he said , If you will say that Cornish had the money , my Drawer , and all the House shall swear it , and so we shall all get clear . Prisoner . She has not said one thing that 's true - How should I tell her the Prosecutor 's Name was Pollamounter , when he was a Stranger to me ? Boucher . Well enough , for you were a great while drinking in his Company , and might hear Cornish call him by his Name - The Prisoner 's Defence . Edward Redman , the Drawer . Pollamounter and Cornish , and two little Girls came in and asked for a Room . I shewed them up Stairs , and carried them a Bottle of Wine . In five Minutes the Bell rung , I ran up again . Pollamounter bid me take a Candle and shew him another Room , which I did , and he went into this Room with one of the Girls . They had a Pint of Wine there , and staid a Quarter of an Hour , and then he call 'd again , and bid me fetch a Constable , for the Girl had got a Crown of his Money . But the Girl said , he gave it her , and nothing was sreer than Gift , and so I left 'em . He rung again , and bid me send my Mistress . When I went down , the Prisoner was just come in a Doors , and my Mistress desired him to step up ; which he did and sat down to drink with them in the Room that they first went into , and they seemed to make a Joke of the Crown - One of the little Girls went away , and then Peg Boucher came in . The Door of Pollamounter 's Room stood open , and as I was going by there with Peg to shew her into another Room , Pollamounter pulled her in , and set her upon his Knee . K. Council . What did that Girl Boucher come in by her self and call for a Room ? Redman . No , there was another Gentleman with her , and I was going to shew them both into a Room , when Pollamounter pulled her in . K. Council . What , in the presence of the Gentleman ? Redman . Yes . K. Council . Sure the Gentleman was very angry ? Redman . No , not at all . K. Council . Did he so easily quit he : then ? - It looks a little strange , but what became of him ? Redman . He said no more but went away very quietly - The Bell rung again , I went up and Peg was still upon Pollamounter 's Knee . He called for a Candle and another Room , I shewed Peg and him into the same Room he was in before with the other Girl . They had a Bottle of Wine together . She staid a Quarter of an Hour with him , and then came down and went out - He followed in five Minutes , and asked me if I knew the Girl or where she was . I told him , no . He said she had pick 'd his Pocket of forty Pounds . Then the Prisoner and Cornish , and the other little Girl came down , and the Prisoner said , I am sorry for your Loss , I have some knowledge of her and will try to find her out . So Pollamounter came into the Kitchen . The little Girl went away , and the Prisoner and Cornish went out together to see for Peg , but while they were gone , Peg came in again by her self and asked Mrs. Provost , the Bar-keeper ; where Pollamounter was ; he was then gone out of the Kitchen into another Room below Stairs . The Bar-keeper called me , and I shewed Peg in , and she said to him , Sir , I have taken your Money in a Joke , and I 'll willingly return it if you ' l forgive me . But before she delivered it , Cornish came in , and she gave the Money to Cornish in Pollamounter 's Presence . They counted it , and said , there was thirty Pound fifteen Shillings , but they said some Jacobus 's were missing ; Peg cry 'd , and declar 'd that she did not take a Farthing more - When Peg first came into the House the Prisoner did not speak a Word to her , for he was then above Stairs - Nor was he in Company with Pollamounter and Cornish when the Money was returned , and counted , for he went into the Kitchen and staid drinking with three or four Friends and did not go any more into the other Company . Pollamounter having got his Money again , called for a broild Fowl and Mushroom Sauce , and a Bowl of Arnack Punch . When the Supper was ready Cornish came into the Kitchen and invited the Prisoner and Mrs. Glascock to eat with them , but they both refused . Cornish went back , and when they had all supt , Pollamounter and Peg beginning to talk about going to bed , Cornish left them , and came into the Kitchen and call 'd for a Bottle of Wine by himself . Pollamounter had another Bowl of Punch . The Prisoner desired Cornish to go in and see that his Friend Pollamounter , did not lose his Money again ; but he would not go . I went my self soon after , to snuff the Candles , and Peg was then gone . Pollamounter asked me where she was , but made no complaint then ; tho ' it was not long before he came into the Kitchen with a Stick in his Hand , and after a time he said to Cornish , You Rogue you have got my Money ! and with that he shivered his Stick to pieces by striking it upon the Table , and then said , If I have not my Money again , I 'll swear against all the House . K. Council . What Room did Pollamounter and the two Girls go into at first ? Redman . The Nine at the Stair 's Head and in a Quarter of an Hour Peg and the Gentleman came in , and I was going to shew them into the Eight on the Left-hand at the Stair 's Head . And the Door of the Nine being open , Pollamounter pulled her in as she was going by , and in five or six Minutes he left Cornish , and the Prisoner , and the two little Girls , and went with Peg into another Room ? K. Council Do you make a Practice of carrying Gentlemen and such Ladies into private Rooms ? Redman . I am a Servant , and is my Business to oblige my Mistresses Customers . I would wait upon you , or any other Gentleman if need required . Elizabeth Smith . Pollamounter and Cornish coming out of a Coach , they forced me , and this other little Girl into the Tavern . K. Council . How old are you ? E. Smith Sixteen - We sat drinking together a little while , and then I went with Pollamounter into another Room , where he gave me a Crown and was very impudent ; and then he wanted his Money again , but I would not give it him . Prisoner . Did not he say that you robb 'd him ? E. Smith . No , he own 'd he gave me a Crown - I was with him three Quarters of an Hour . Mary Reeves . The two Gentlemen took us both in by force . K. Council . How old are you ? M. Reeves . Sixteen . K. Council . Sixteen ? She do n't look to be above twelve . M. Reeves . He took the other young Woman into a private Room , and gave her a Crown , and wanted to be rude with her , but I suppose she would not let him , and so he wanted his Money again , but she went away with it . K. Council . How came you to stay after she was gone ? M. Reeves . I did not know she was gone , but thought she was coming in again , so I staid a Quarter of an Hour , and then Peg Boucher came and opened the Door . K. Council . Was not the Door open when she came ? M. Reeves . I can not say but it might be a jar . She opened it and said , I thought it had been other Company . And with that Pollamounter pull 'd her in and sat her upon his Knee and kist her - The Prisoner was then in our Company , and did not stir out of the Room till she was gone . K. Council . Was any body with her ? M. Reeves . No , there was no Soul with her . K. Council . The Drawer swore that himself and a Gentleman were with her . M. Reeves . But I am sure there was no such thing - Pollamounter went with her into another Room where they staid a quarter of an Hour , and then he came back and said she had robbed him , and then I went away . Mother Provost , the Bar-keeper . Pollamounter and Cornish came in with the two little Girls : They went up , called for a Bottle of Wine , and in near half an Hour I heard a Noise above . The Prisoner coming in at the same time , and Mrs. Glascock not being well , she desired him to go up ; which he did , and staid with them . By-and by Pollamounter came down and said he had lost his Money . The Prisoner and Cornish came down after him , and the Prisoner offer 'd to do him what Service he could , and so went out with Cornish to see for Boucher . While they were gone , she came in and asked me where Pollamounter was . The Drawer shewed her in , and she returned the Money . Pollamounter then ordered a Fowl and Mushroom Sauce for Supper , and two Bowls of Punch . And after the Money was restored , the Prisoner never went into Pollamounter 's Company , but staid drinking in the Kitchen with Mr. Longbotham , and five or six more , and was not out of the Kitchen in all the time - Pollamounter was in a little Room joining to the Kitchen . Cornish after he had supped with Pollamounter , came into the Kitchen , and Mrs. Glascock said to him , Take care of your Friend 's Money , for he has lost it once and may lose it again . Cornish , answered , Damn him he has got more Money than Brains ! K. Council . Was Peg gone before this Advice was given ? Provost . No , she was there then - But soon after , Pollamounter came into the Kitchen , and cry 'd he had lost his Money - He charged his Friend with having it , but however they both went away very lovingly together . K. Council . Did any Man come in with Peg at first ? Provost . I do not know - but there might . K. Council . Was it not the Porter ? Provost . I am not sure that any body came in with her . K. Council . Did the Porter or the Drawer go up with her ? Provost . No , upon my Oath - no indeed . neither of them - no body went up with her , K. Council . This again directly contradicts the Drawer 's Evidence . Thomas How . Between eight and nine at Night , I and four more went to the Angel and Crown Tavern , and sat down in the Kitchen to drink : the Prisoner soon after came into the Kitchen , and we asked him to take a Grab , but he refused , and said , he was going with Cornish to look for a Girl that had pick 'd a Gentleman 's Pocket of Thirty Pounds . Thereupon he and Cornish went out , and while they were gone , the Drawer came in and said the Girl was come back of her self ; and soon afterwards the Prisoner and Cornish returned , and presently Pollamounter came out of a Room and said , Now I have got all my Money , lets have a Fowl and a Bowl of Punch . Then he and Cornish went into the Room again where they staid about an Hour , and then Cornish came into the Kitchen and called for a Bottle . In a Quarter of an Hour Pollamounter followed him , and asked where the Woman was , and turning to Cornish , asked him , if he had got his Money ? Cornish answered no . Pollamounter struck his Stick upon the Table , and said he had lost his Money in that House , and he would prosecute the Girl and all in the House but he would have it again - And from the time that the Prisoner came in from looking for the Girl , to the time that Pollamounter came and said he had lost his Money , the Prisoner was not once out of the Kitchen . Henry Moythen . of Drury-Lane , Robert Longbotham , a Marshals-Court Officer in Belton-street , Giles Jackson , a Cutler , and Gilbert Campbell , deposed much to the same effect . Moythen indeed said that the Prisoner and Cornish returned in five Minutes ; and Longbotham said it was half an Hour ; And Jackson , was more particular than the rest as to the Words that past between Pollamounter and Cornish in the Kitchen : For according to him the Dialogue ran thus . Pollamounter said to Cornish , You have got my Money . No , I have not , says Cornish . D - it , says Pollamounter , you never gave it me again . By G - but I did ; says Cornish . D - ye , but you did not ; says Pollamounter . And , D - you , but I did . Says Cornish . Why then by G - , says Pollamounter , this Bitch has got it again ; and as she is gone , I 'll charge the House with it . Ann Steer . I keep a Publick-House , the Queen's-head in Ship-yard by Temple-bar . I have known Pollamounter two or three Months . H. came to my house the Day after he lost his Money , and said , he had taken Peg Boucher , and she was committed to the Counter , and that she had likewise taken up the Prisoner , upon account of his being in the House at the same time , but did not know who had got the Money . He told me next Day that he had been to the Compter , and the Girl complaining that no body sent her any thing to support her , he gave her something : And that she said she was sorry the Prisoner was in Custody because he was innocent . But Pollamounter told me , that all he wanted was to get her to be an Evidence . And Mrs. Pollamounter told me , that all the Money her Husband could get , was to carry to his Whore in Newgate . Prisoner . Did you never hear him say that he offer 'd her Money to swear against me ? Court . Call in Pollamounter - He ought to hear what is sworn against him - now proceed . Ann Steer , to Pollamounter . You said , the Girl told you she was sorry the Prisoner was to suffer , because he was innocent : And that you gave her Money , and would give any Money to have her made an Evidence . Pollamounter . I never said any such thing , nor over gave her a Penny ; this Woman Steer , offer 'd to compound the Matter with me , but I refused - there was O Brian , Macdonald and Marclough - Ann Steer . I offer ? - It was you that offer 'd it , and said you could make a Hundred Guineas of it . For my Part , I never saw the Prisoner in my life before , But I have heard you and Cornish quarrel and threaten to blow one another up - You and he together owe me above 10 l. Esau Steer . Three Days ago , when Pollamounter had been a Raking all Night , and breaking Lamps and Windows , he came to me and said he had been advised to take the whole House up , and then he should get a Hundred Guineas more than he had lost - some Soldiers came after him one Day , and said , he belonged to Col. Churchill 's Regiment , and was a Deserter . Pollamounter . You shew 'd me forty Guineas , and brought People to compound this Villany . Prisoner . I have some Witnesses to my Character - Mr. Jones will you be so good as to speak ? Mr. Jones . I came hither only out of Curiosity - But as the Prisoner has called upon me , I can say that I have known him five Years - He 's an Officer to the Sheriff of Middlesex , and I never heard before , that he was - a Thief . P Council . Do you think he would combine with Whores to pick Pockets ? Mr. Jones . I think he had no occasion to do so , for he could get Money without taking such Methods . Robert Crown . I was one of his Security , I have known him Fourteen or fifteen Years , a very honest Man , and I do n't believe he 'd be guilty of what he is charg 'd with . Henry Daintry . And I gave Security for him to the Sheriff - he has a good Character . James Myat . I knew him Twenty Years ago . I have drank with him within these two Years - He had a fair Character as to that part of the Story about Thieving . Edward Tresham and William Kirk , deposed that he had a very good Character .
