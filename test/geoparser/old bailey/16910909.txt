[ Death . See summary . ] B - J - , Gent . Was Indicted for the wilful Murther of his own Wife Elizabeth J - on the 18th Day of July last ; but before the Tryal proceeded a fresh Jury of Gentlemen were Empannel 'd , whose Names are these : Edward Knowls John Milner William Webb William Dinn Richard Bealing Gilbert Wharton Thomas Sutton Charles Drumfeild John Outting Robert Longland John Burchet Robert Young . After the Jury were Sworn , the Court proceded to a distinct Tryal of the Prisoner ; and the Witnesses being called on the Kings side , and Sworn , the first at which was one Mrs. Godman , who deposed , That the Prisoner 's Wife was a Lodger at her House , at Kensington for about the space of 5 Weeks ; at the latter end of which time , she observed her to be very Melancholy till the day before the Murther was done , which was on a Friday , and on the Saturday Morning she was found Dead ; she declared to her Landlady , Mrs. Godman , and her family after Supper , on the over Night , that her Husband had sent for her into St. James 's Street , about 7 a Clock , where she was going , and that she should not come home that Night : on the Morrow Morning about Six of the Clock , some of the Country Men found her lying at the end of Kensington , near the High-way , exposed in a very undecent manner , her Coats turn 'd up , her Hand all bloody , lying upon her Thigh , her Throat cut , as also her Breast , with a Mortal wound under her left Ear , her Face covered over with Blood , and a piece of a Case knife , valu 'd 1d . lying betwixt her Face and her Hood , in a most horrible amazing , and most frightful manner , with her Body luke-warm : After the Murther was done , but before the Woman was found Dead , one of the Evidence Swore , That he saw a man walking up and down a Field in the Grass , out of the Path-way , near whereto the dead Corps lay , throwing his hands abroad , Sighing , lamenting , and bemoaning himself , in a most distracted manner , which he verily believed was the Prisoner at the Bar , but he was a matter of 15 Rood off him ; then the Deceased 's Brother , one Mr Willis , and others went to the Prisoner 's Chamber , and having found him out acquainted him , That his Wife lay Murthered in such a place , as aforesaid , at which he seemed not so much affected as might be expected , shuffling himself off from them , by pretending earnest Business else-where , desiring his Brother to seek after the Destroyer ; but they not willing to let him go , carried him to an Ale-house hard by , where his Mother sending for him , they were perswaded to let him go to her , he before-hand ingeniously promising to return immediately again , which he did not ; so after they had got a Justice of Peace 's Warrant , the Constable found him at his Fathers House lock 'd up in a Room ; his Mother denying of him at their first entrance ; being apprehended , his Fingers were found cut , his Cravat stained with two spots of Blood , he walking up and down the Room without his Hat : Being brought before the Justice , he was examined where he had been the Night before ; to which Question he could give no satisfactory Answer ; and as touching his cut Fingers , he gave but a frivolous Account , viz . That a Man assaulted him as he was going up Stairs into his Chamber about Eleven a Clock at Night , drew his Sword upon him , and would have Robbed him , as he thought , but he had no Evidence to prove it , only he called his Fathers Man and Maid to prove what time he went to Bed the Night before the Murther was done , which was about Eleven a Clock ; but he was alone when he went to Bed , and the Maid had the Key given to her by the Prisoner , for the Man-servant to come to Bed , who lay in the next Room , but was at that time waiting upon his Father at his House , some distance from the Chambers , so that the Man did not see him that Night , nor speak to him : He offered also several other frivolous pretences by way of Extenuation , which did not tend at all to his Advantage . So after about Four Hours fair hearing on both sides , the Jury went out , and having well considered , gave in their Verdict , That he was Guilty of Wilfull Murther . [ Death .
