The Prisoner then said , That there was a Lady in the Strand that used to buy Coals of him , and he would go to help her . That they immediately went to Temple-Bar , and stopp 'd no where by the way ; but at Temple-Bar they were stopp 'd , and forc 'd by the Crowd thro ' Shere-Lane into Lincolns-Inn-Square , and from thence thro ' the Wicket into Lincolns-Inn-Fields ; That against the Wicket in Duke-street , the Mob seeing the Prisoner in the Queen 's Cloth , caught him by the Cravat , and told him , They they would dash his Brains out , if he would not go with them , and as soon as they laid Hands of him , he left him and went Home .

The Persons Sworn upon the Jury for George Purchase were as follows . Thomas Sutton , Esq ; John Furness John Parsons Joseph Parsons William Hargrave John Meard Edward Boswell Robert Breakspear Richard Bearknife Richard Hazzard Francis Higgins Humphrey Newman George Purchase was Indicted for High-Treason , for that he with a great Multitude of People Armed , did on the 1st of March last levy open War against the Queen . The first Evidence against the Prisoner was Captain Orrill , who deposed , that after he had been several times at Mr. Burges 's Meeting-House , and saw that Demolished , and the Fire made in Lincolns-Inn-Fields , with the Utensils thereof , he met a Detachment of the Queen 's Guards , and directed them to go to Drury-Lane ; that when he with the Guards came thither , he law a Bonfire made with the Pews and other Utensils thereof , and a great Mob about it , which were scattered by the Guards ; That there he saw the Prisoner under a Bulk with a drawn Sword in his Hand , who pushed several times at theHorses Breast with his Sword to keep them off ; That he was then driven from that Place , and went a small Distance off , to the end of Long-Acre ; That then this Witness went up to him , he asked him what he meant , and said , in opposing the Guard , he opposed the Queen , and would have had him put up his Sword and go home ; instead of taking his Advice , made this Reply , Damn ye , who are you for , High-Church and Sacheverell or no , I am God Damn them all ( meaning the Guards ) for I am as good a Man as any of them all , and called to the Mobb , Come on , come on Boys , I 'll lead you on , I am for High-Church and Sacheverell , and I 'll lose my Life in the Cause ; after this he run resolutely with his Sword in his Hand , and made a full Pass at the Officer 's Body , but one of the Guards giving a large , Spring , beat his Sword down , or else he would have run him through the left Flank : That he retir 'd a little lower , and the Guards had at this time dispersed all the Mob , knocking down about 40 or 50 of them in the Action : As this Witness was going off he heard some of the Mob say , They would be even with the Guards to Morrow Night , for they durst not fire upon them . Richard Russell , one of the Guards depos 'd , That he was Commanded by his Serjeant to match into Drury-Lane , and to return their Bionets , and draw their Swords ; That when they came to Drury-Lane there was a Bonfire , with a large Mobb about it ; That at the Fire , the Horse were all drawn into one Line with their Tails against the Wall ; That none of the Mobb might come behind ; That Purchase then stood in the middle of the Lane and Huzza 'd , and came up and would have thrust himself between two Horses , but was beaten off with the Flats of their Swords ; That then the Guards wheeled about the Fire , and the Prisoner came up at the Head of the Mobb , and cried , Damn ye , who are you for ? Whether for High-Church or Low-Church , or Dr. Sacheverell ? This Evidence deposed , That it was about a quarter of an Hour before the Mobb was dispersed there . One Sutherland , an Officer , that drew the Grenadiers up , deposed , That he saw the Prisoner several times at the Bonfire in Drury-Lane ; That he there saw him flourish his drawn Sword ; and cried out , He was for Sacheverell : This Evidence went up to him , and said , Sir are you encouraging the Mobb ? He replied , He was for Sacheverell : That this Evidence went up to Capt . Horsey to acquaint him how Troublesome the Prisoner had been , and received Orders from the Captain to cut him to pieces , but the Prisoner then made off . The next Witness was George Richardson , he deposed , That he knew the Prisoner , for they had been together in Flanders ; That on the 1st of March , about ten at Night , the Guards marched from St. James 's , to Lincolns-Inn-Fields , where they quelled the Mobb , and marched from thence into Drury-Lane ; That when they came there , they found a Bonfire with a great Mobb about it ; That they struck the People with the Flats of their Swords , and dispersed them ; This Evidence farther deposed , That he saw the Prisoner there make a Thrust at Captain Hansberg , and said to him , Do you intend to Kill my Officer ; then with his Sword he struck down the Prisoner 's Point , upon which the Prisoner retired under a Pent-House , and this Evidence rid up to him with a design to cut him down , but was prevented by his Sword breaking , as it was lifted up against the Pent-House . Being asked whether the Prisoner knew Capt . Hansberg , replied , that he did , for he was Abroad with him in Flanders . The Prisoner in his Defence-produced divers Witnesses to prove that he had-been drinking from Nine in the Morning till Ten at Night , at which time he came from the Cross-Keys Tavern , Covent-Garden , with Mr. Broad the Balliff , who deposed he left him very much in Drink , and as he thought going to his own House . There was nothing in the whole Evidence for the Prisoner that contradicted any thing that was Sworn by the Queen 's Evidence , so that after my Lord Chief Justice Parker had summed up the Evidence on both sides , the Jury went out , and returned in about four Hours , well satisfied with the Proof of the Fact , but not as to the Points of Law , and therefore brought in their Verdict Special . Joseph Waller and John Herbert of St. Dunstans in the East , were both Indicted for Feloniously Stealing four Coils of Rope , 12 s. two Iron Crows , and two Chains , the Goods of Thomas Read . It appeared , that the Prosecutor lost his Goods out of his Shop in the Night , which were afterwards found upon the Prisoners , who when Apprehended , confessed the Fact , the Jury found them both Guilty of Felony .
