Margaret Nelson depos 'd , That the Prisoner and Phoebe Thickpenny , came to her House in Leather-Lane , and he call 'd for a private Room , to which the Girl would not consent , that the Girl wanted to go to , & c. and she went with her , when the Girl said , she had her Mistress 's Gold Watch , and seeming to look on it , told her it was 7 o ' Clock , but this Deponent did not see the Watch , yet she said , she did verily believe she heard it beat , that they soon parted , and in a Quarter of an Hour the maid returned , and said she had lost the Watch . The Prisoner said in his Defence , That he knew nothing of it , any further than she said it was her Mistress 's , that they parted very good Friends , and she having been an old Sweetheart of his , laid her Head upon his Shoulder , and said , She could live and die there , which would have been no little Aggravation to his Crime , had he wrong 'd so good Natur 'd a Creature : But the Evidence against him being weak , and several appearing to his Character , the Jury acquitted him .

The Prosecutor depos 'd , That she did not know how the Prisoner came to take her Forks , for she was so well recommended to her from the French Church at Amsterdam , that notwithstanding it was plain , she took them out of her House , she could not tell how to think her otherwise than a very honest Girl , for she might have took a great deal more . Mrs. Puncho depos 'd , That she took the Prisoner with the Forks , she then confess 'd she had taken them out of her Mistress 's House , and would have had this Deponent took the Forks and let her get away , which Mrs. Puncho refusing she bit her Finger , which proved her a Bite ; notwithstanding the Prosecutor 's good Opinion of her , the Jury found her guilty to the Value of 10d .

Thomas Gun depos 'd , That the Prisoner not only run away with his Goods , but he run away with his Wife , ( not mention 'd in the Indictment ) in his Absence , yet he confess 'd that his Wife was very bad , and the Prisoner was so kind to carry her away in a Coach , though he borrowed a Shilling of his Landlord to pay the Coachman . The Nurse who look 'd after the Prosecutor 's Wife depos 'd , That her Mistress being very bad , and she having Occasion to go to Market to buy Provision , desired the Prisoner to look after her till she returned , and when she came back they were both gone , though her Mistress was so weak she was fit for nothing . Robert Carr depos 'd , That he saw the Prisoner take the Books , and Jane Moulden depos 'd , That she heard an Irish Man , the Prisoner 's Countryman , say , That the Prisoner sold 2 of the Prosecutor 's Books . She further said , That she saw the Prisoner bring back the Stockings to the Prosecutor 's Wife : But what the Man told her was no Evidence , and her seeing the Prisoner bring back the Stockings , did not make it appear that the Prisoner stole them , though she produced a Part of them in Court , for they being out at the Ankles , were converted to a Pair of Gloves . The Prisoner said more in his Defence than could be contain 'd in this Paper , the most material Part was as follows : The first Acquaintance I had with this Family was occasioned by the Prosecutor 's Wife being my Countrywoman , I was going to see them , and they were coming to see me , till we knew one another better and better , and then the Prosecutor 's Wife fell sick , and indeed and she was very bad , and I pitied her , and the she had a little Child , and it was a great deal of Trouble to her , so I took it in my Arms and carried it home to my House , and three Weeks after I went again , and she said she was a little better , but her Nurse run her to a great deal of Charges , and what her Husband was getting could not support it . So the Nurse being gone to Market I got her out of Bed , and like a Fool , as I was , I put her in a Coach and carried her to my own House , and there I took more Care of her than I would of either my own Wife , or indeed of my own Mother , for I let her lie in my own Bed , and I laid my self down in a Closet , till I was so stiff I could not perform my Business ; all this while , though I was very bad myself , I took so much Care of my Countrywoman , that in a little Time she was able to be walking about the House , and do any Thing which a Woman in Health should be doing , and then her Husband came , and he was likewise lying in my House sometimes , and said , he should never make me amends for my Kindness , and indeed and I believe and he never designs it , for when he took his Wife home they grew very ungrateful , for she demanded her Pail , which she had before gave me , when I fetched it to wash her Feet in , and she bid me fetch the Stockings , which she gave me , and the Books , which I took for her cross-grain 'd Child to play with ; and then I was demanding my Money for my Trouble , and then I was demanding my Looking-glass , which I lent them ( for my Face is not so handsome that I should take a Pride to look at it ) and then the Prosecutor and I fell to Quarrelling , and he said , he would sell his Soul to Ninety-nine Devils but he would Prosecute me , and I said , and I would trust to the Lord God and the Law , and then we went to the Law together , and I cast him and recovered Damages , and that is the Cause of my being brought here ; and I hope the Honourable Court will consider it , since I desire no more but to be 'quitted and to be clear , and to have a copy of my indictment . He then produc 'd several Witnesses , who depos 'd , That they had promised him Satisfaction for the Trouble he had in looking after the Prosecutor 's Wife , and that he had recovered a Verdict and Judgement at Guild-Hall , for their not making him Satisfaction : the Jury considering the Whole , brought in their Verdict Not Guilty . Peter Pemberton , Mary Pemberton , and Mary Mason , of Billingsgate , were indicted for privately stealing 5 Guineas , and four Shillings in Silver , on the 28th of May last , from the Person of Thomas Bete . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That he had been some Time acquainted with Peter Pemberton , and the Night on which he was robb 'd , he had been at his House in Rosemary-lane , and having occasion to go to Billingsgate , Peter Pemberton and the other two Prisoners would go with him , that they went together to the Three Tun Tavern at Billingsgate , that he was sure he had his Money when they went into the House , for he had pull 'd out a Guinea to lay a Wager , and when they were gone he miss 'd it . He further said , That when he had them apprehended on Suspicion of having robb 'd him , Peter Pemberton offer 'd to make it up , and did actually deposit Three Guineas and a Note in the Constable 's Hands for that End , but the Magistrate before whom they went , would not suffer them to compound a Felony . Mr. Wright the Constable depos 'd , That Pemberton put the Money and Note in his Hands , yet did not confess the Robbery , but on the contrary said , he would rather pay than suffer wrongfully , and being then very sick he said he would do any Thing sooner than go to Newgate . The Prisoner said in his Defence , That they told him it would cost him 50 l. if he went to Newgate , and so said his Wife and Mary Mason . This being considered , and the Evidence not being plain the Prosecutor staying to drink in other Company all Night , after he had lost his Money , besides , it being proved that the Prosecutor said , he should not have proceeded but for the Sollicitor , and the Prisoners , especially ( Peter Pemberton ) having several to appear to their Character , they were all three acquitted . Sarah Payn , alias Matthews , of St. Giles 's without Cripplegate , was indicted for privately stealing a Guinea and Half a Guinea , from the Person of John Polliter , and 36 Yards of Silver Lace , value 5 l. in the Dwelling-house of Thomas Smith , on the 28th of January last , the Property of John Polliter aforesaid . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That the Prisoner pick 'd him up and persuaded him to go home to her Lodgings , where he gave her Half a Crown to fetch Salmon for Supper , and then they drank two full Pots of Beer and a Dram , after which they laid down upon the Bed , & c. and presently he felt her take his Money , and charging her with it , she said she would give it him again , but did not , for when she came with him to the Door she laugh 'd at him ; that he went away , but did not miss his Silver lace , which he had laid upon the Dresser which stood by the Bed-side , in a Bag , in which was as much as was worth 14 or 15 l. but she had only taken out four Pieces , value 5 l. which he supposed she took whilst he was asleep . Honest Elizabeth Smith depos 'd , That the Prisoner brought the Prosecutor to her Room , and sent her for the Salmon and for the Drink , and that when she came back the Prosecutor said , the Prisoner had got a Guinea and Half from him , and he would cut her Throat , at the same Time holding a Knife in his Hand , he struck at her and cut her Necklace , when the Prisoner said to him , My dear , dear Polliter , do n't hurt me ; after this he went away , and this Deponent went to Bed , and would have had the Prisoner come to Bed too , but she refused it , and upon this Deponent 's asking her if she had got his Money , the Prisoner not only shew 'd it her , but said , she had got something of him which was better still , and then shew 'd her the Silver Lace ; after which , she put it in this Deponent 's Drawer , saying , she knew she was very welcome to it , but this Deponent seem 'd to tell with some Concern , that when she 'wakd in the Morning the Prisoner was gone , and had taken both the Lace and Money with her . It appeared by other Witnesses , that the Prisoner was a wicked dissolute Creature , and had got Drunk with the Money , and sold some Part of the Lace to a Shoemaker . The Prisoner had little to say in her Defence , but that she had it with the Prosecutor 's Leave , they being too well acquainted for him to deny her any Thing , nor would he have prosecuted her , had not the Shoemaker stopp 'd her and sent for the Prosecutor 's Wife , and thereby discovered the Intriegue between them : But the Prosecutor 's Folly would not excuse her Theft , for it evidently appeared that she had taken the Lace without his Knowledge and Consent ; upon which the Jury found her guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d. for taking the Goods , but acquitted her of the Charge of taking the Money , it being laid in a different Indictment .
