Thomas Cooper thus depos 'd . About 10 at Night the Prisoner met me near Aldgate , and thrust me up in a Corner and swore she 'd cut my Throat if I did not give her all that I had about me . A Man belonging to her ( as I suppose ) came up to us . I was Sadly frighted , and gave her 2 Holland Doits and 18 Pence ; and then seeing a Man coming along with a Lanthorn , I called out for help ! The Woman was brought to the Watch-House , and the 2 Holland Pieces were found upon her , but she denied the 18 Pence . William Bishop thus depos 'd . The Boy calling the Watch , I went up to him , and found him with a Man and a Woman ; he said the Man had rob 'd him . I carried the Man to the Watch-House , and then the Boy told me I should have brought the Woman too , for he knew not which of 'em it was that had got his Money . Soon after he had spoken , the Prisoner came in of her own accord , and said , Are not you a wicked young Rogue , to say that I rob 'd you , when you gave me these two Copper Pieces to go down an Alley with you . The Man was cleared before the Justice , and the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . Henry Jones was indicted for privately stealing three Shillings and six Pence from John Page , Sept. 22 . John Page thus depos 'd . About a Week ago I was drinking with the Prisoner at the House of Mr. Club , the Feathers in Watling Street . I made a Shift to get drunk and fell asleep , and so I lost my Money . Thomas Club thus depos 'd . While Page was asleep , I saw the Prisoner put his Hand into Page 's Pocket , and just as he drew it out again , I stept up to him and laid hold of his Hand . You Rogue , I 'll have no such doings in my House , says I . What do ye mean , Says he . Mean , says I , why , I saw ye pick the Man 's Pocket . He swore he had got nothing in his Hand . I bid him open it then , but he would not , and thereupon I and another Man wrench 'd open his Hand , and found 3 s. 6d . in it . There was no persuading him to return it to the Prosecutor , for he said it was his own , and that the Prosecutor had borrowed it of him . Several other Witnesses depos 'd to the same Effect , and the Jury found him Guilty . Death . Joseph Rashfield , was indicted for Stealing a silk Gown , value 30 Shillings , the Goods of Joshua Taylor , a Fustian Coat , value 20 Shillings , the Goods of William Taylor , 3 Silk Gowns value 10 l. and a Petticoat , and other things , the Goods of Anne Edwards on the 27 of August , and Elizabeth Field , was indicted for receiving part of the said Goods , knowing them to be Stoln . The Fact appeared thus : John Bains , a Waterman , had received a Bundle from Mrs. Taylor on Fish Street-Hill , and a Box from Mr. Sale in Newgate Street . These 2 Parcels he put into his Boat , which lay at Church-yard Stairs near the Bridge . He left the Boat there about a quarter of an Hour . At his Return the Boat was gone , and he afterwards found it at St. Mary Overies Stairs . It was carried thither , and the Goods taken out of it by the Prisoner Rashfield , who delivered 'em to Anne Bines and Sarah Rice , and they carried great part of 'em to the Prisoner Field , who gave 'em 3 Pounds for what was worth about 10 , and told 'em that she would Lock any thing that they could speak with , though it was the King 's Crown , meaning , that she would buy any thing that they could Steal . Advertisements being spread among the Pawnbrokers ; and Bines and Rice having pledged another of the Growns to William Wood in Worcester Street in the Park Southwark , he apprehended 'em , and they impeached the Prisoner . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] Samuel Bucknall , was indicted for stealing a Hat value 5 Shillings , the Goods of Stephen Austin , September 2 . Stephen Austin thus depos 'd . While I was at St. Dunstan 's Church , I saw a Hand reach my Hat from a back Seat ; I heard that Mr. Barefoot followed the Thief and took the Hat upon him . Barefoot not appearing , the Evidence was insufficient , and the Jury quitted the Prisoner . William Marjoram , alias Elias Huggady , was indicted for privately stealing a Butchers Steel , value 2 Shillings and 6 Pence , the goods of Thomas Pye , Sept. 19 . Thomas Pye thus depos 'd . About 10 at Night I and 2 or 3 more Butchers were going along Long-lane , and two Fellows came out of Charter-house-street and followed us . I presently felt my Apron-strings cut and mist my Steel ; I turned about , and a Boy said to me , Yonder goes the Man that cut your Apron-string , he took your Steel , and gave it to another . Jonathan Ward ( a Boy ) thus depos 'd . I saw the Butchers going along , and the Prisoner come behind and cut the Prosecutor 's Apron-string , take away his Steel , and give it to a Man in a great Coat . The Prosecutor turned about , and said he had lost his Steel . I shew 'd 'em which was the Man that took it . The Prisoner ran into Barbican , and there was taken . Robert Crouch thus depos 'd . As I stood up to piss in Long-lane , I saw the Prisoner cut my Brother Butcher 's Apron-string , but I thought he had been an Acquaintance of his , and was only playing the Rogue in Jest , I did not presently offer to stop him . The Prisoner was an old Offender , he had been an Evidence against Blewit and his Gang , and had not been a Week out of Goal when he was taken for this Fact . The Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . Death . Joseph Smith , and David Anderson , were indicted for privately stealing from Thomas Collier a Coat and Waist-coat value 30 Shillings , a Hat , a pair of Silver Buckles , a Handkerchief , a pair of Gloves , a Tobacco-box , a Knife and Fork , half a Guinea , and 25 Shillings on the 2nd of August . Thomas Collier thus depos 'd . I had been a drinking with some Friends at the King's-Arms-Tavern at Charing-Cross , and so got fuddled , as a Man may say , and we parted about 10 at Night , and I went along the Strand , as I think they call it , in order to go to my Lodging at the George Inn at Holborn-Bridge ; I was a stranger in this Town , and whither I went , or what I did with my self I can not tell , but I fell asleep somewhere or other , and when I waked , I found my self upon my Back without either Hat or Wig , or Coat or Wastcoat . It was mortal Dark , and I look 'd up and saw nothing but the Sky above me , and in a great Amazement I was ; says I to my self , what will become of me ? Where am I ? In the World or out of it ? At last I lookt a little lower and saw the tops of the Houses , and then I be thought my self I was got into some Town or other , and was lying in the middle of a dark Alley without any Clothes upon my Back , though still I was strangely confounded to think which way I got there , and how I came to be in such a sad Condition : However , I made shift to get upon my Legs , and quickly came into a Street that lookt a little lighter ; and as I was going along , I spied a Man making Candles : I inquired of him where about I was , and he ask 'd me how I came to be in that Pickle . I told him that I could give no other Account of it but that I came from Whitney and had lost my self . Pray , says he , do ye know Mr. Busby in Whitney ? Yes very well , says I and every me body else in that Town , and so upon that he lent me a Cap and a great Coat , and carried over to an Ale-house , where I staid till day-light , and then sent for some of my Friends . When they came , they went with me to look for what I had lost , and there we went up and down till we met one Joseph Smith with my Clothes upon his Back , my Cane in his Hand , and my Wig in his Pocket ; but whether or no that was the same Joseph that stands here at the Barr I can not tell , it may , and it may not , but I believe he has got my Wastcoat on his Back at this time ; its true the Wastcoat that I lost was a black one , and this that he has got is a Grey , but its all one for that , a black Man may turn grey , and so may a black Waistcoat . Edmund Purser and John Ellis thus depos 'd . We had been drinking with the Prosecutor over Night at the Kings-Arms at Charing-Cross : he was fuddled when he went away , and I desired him to send for a Coach , but he said he 'd try how his Legs would carry him first , and so we parted . About 6 a-clock next Morning Word was brought us that the Prosecutor was at the Rose and Crown Ale-House in Drury-lane , and that he had been rob 'd and stript and left asleep in the Street . We quickly found him , and took him with us to look for the Persons that had rob 'd him . We made Enquiry after ill Houses , and were particularly directed to Castle-Alley in Mercer 's Street near Long-Acre , and there found the Prisoner Smith with the Goods upon him . Barbara Hughsly thus depos 'd . Betweed 7 and 8 in the Morning the Prosecutor and others came to my House and took my Maid Servant from the Fire , and said she was the Woman that caus 'd the three Soldiers to rob him . While they were in the Alley , the Prisoner Joseph Smith came out of a House with the Prosecutor 's Cloths upon his Back and his Cane in his Hand . I went to seize him , and he offered to thrust the cane in my Face , but the People being with me we secured him . Thomas Parker thus depos 'd . Several People came to my House in the Morning , and Collier who was with them told me , that he had been rob 'd by some body thereabouts . Why , says I , there are but few Houses in this Alley , and if some of you will stand at one end , and some at another to see who goes out , the rest may search within . By and by we saw Joseph Smith come out of Green 's House . I took the Prosecutor 's Cane and Wig from him , and ask 'd him how he came by 'em . He said he found them in Broad St. Giles 's , and that he bought the Coat in Crown-Court ; but after we came from the Justice 's with him , he told us that the other Prisoner Anderson and Country will were concerned with him in the Robbery , and desired us to look after them , and especially the last , for says he , That Country Will is the greatest Rogue of us all , for he has got all the Money and has run away with it . Mary Williams thus depos 'd . Between 2 or 3 in the Morning , I met the Prosecutor in Drury Lane , and ask 'd him to give me a dram , and so he went with me to a Gin Shop , and treated me with three or four Quarterns , and then he desir 'd me to help him to a Lodging , whereof I carry 'd him to Welch Kates in Farr 's Ally . Fanny Olifphant was one of her Lodgers , and the Prisoner Smith us 'd to keep Company with her ; And so when we came to Kates Door , we could not have a Lodging there , but however the Prosecutor ( who was very drunk ) gave me a six Pence ( as I thought it to be ) for my trouble . The Prisoner Smith , was sitting at the same time upon a Bank over against us ; He came up to me , and swore he 'd go snacks with me , I told him I had got no more that 6 pence from him , why then D - ye for a Bitch says he , get about your business , or by G - I 'll murder ye , for I 'll have the rest of his Cole my Self . I was glad to get out of the way , but as I turn 'd the Corner of the Ally , I look 'd back , and saw him knock the Prosecutor down , and what he did more I ca n't tell , for I went to Chalkleys Night-house in Princes-Street , and then I found that the Money , that the Prosecutor had given me , half a Guinea instead of a Sixpence . Smith Confest before the Justice that himself , the other Prisoner , and Country Will , and Jenny Austin , took the Prosecutors Money and Cloths , when Moll Williams left him at Welsh Kates Door . There being nothing against Anderson , but Smiths Confestion , which could not affect him , the Jury Acquitted him , and found Smith Guilty . Death . John Thomson , was indicted for the Murder of Sarah Thomson his Wife , alias Sarah Smith Widow , by throwing her into a Ditch , where she was suffocated , and instantly dy 'd on the 9th of September last . He was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroners Inquisition for the said Murder . Robert Philpot thus depos 'd . Between 5 and 6 on Monday Morning , a couple of Men coming by my Door , said that there was a Woman lay dead in a Ditch in Farthing Fields at Stepney . I ran thither and took her up , and laid her upon the Bank , she was not quite Cold , her Throat was cut about two Inches in length , but not to the Windpipe . The Wound did not seem to be an accidental Scratch , but done with a sharp Instrument . - Mathews thus depos 'd . The Prisoner and the Deceas 'd lodged together in my House in King Street Stepney . On the Sunday Morning before the Murder , the Deceas 'd came down Stairs crying , and said , that her Husband had not come home all Night , but was got along with another Woman in Gravel Lane , and she knew not what to do . I advis 'd her to get a Warrant and take him up , she said , that she did not care to do that , because it would expose him too much , but she 'd go and see if the could find him . She went about 9 a Clock , and return 'd about ten , and said , that she had found him a Bed with the Other Woman , who got up and beat her . The Prisoner in about an hour after , came to an Ale-house next door to me , and sent for the Deceas 'd , she went , and I could hear her cry , and talk to him , but could not distinguish the words . Then the came home with her , and at Noon she fetch 'd in some rost Pork for Dinner . I left them together , and went out . I return 'd about 9 at Night and went to Bed . The Prisoner was not then within , but between Ten and Eleven , he came and knockt at the Door , and call 'd out Sarah ! Sarah ! He having made a disturbance with her before , I did not care to let him in , and at last the got up , and let him in herself . I did not hear him go out again , but between 2 and 3 I was awaked with another knocking at the Door . The Deceas 'd open 'd her Window , and the Person at the Door ask 'd if the Sailor was within , for the Prisoner had been a Sailor . The Deceas 'd answered no , he was been gone out about an Hour ; I got up about six , and found the Key under the Street Door ; I open 'd it , and looking out , saw the Prisoner coming towards me . O Mr. Matthews says he , My poor Sarah is kill 'd , she lies in Farthing Fields with her Throat Cut . - But see was none of my Wife . Sarah Perrin thus depos 'd . The Prisoner and I lay on the same Floor in the Garret . On Sunday Morning she said , she could bear her Husbands usage no longer , she must go see for him , for he should keep no Woman under her Nose . She went and came back crying , with her Face ( well 'd , and her Headcloths torn . I went to the House says she , and knocks at the Door , but no body would open it . The Bed stood near the Window , and so I put my Hand though a broken pane of Glass , and pull 'd the Curtain aside , and saw them a Bed together . Then I told them if they would not let me in , I 'd fetch a Constable , upon which , the bold Baggage got up and open 'd the Door , and as soon as I come in , she flew in my Face as if she 'd ' a ' scratch 'd my Eyes out , but my Husband got out of Bed and parted us . A little before Noon the Prisoner sent for her to the next Door Ale-house , and from thence came home with her , and went out again after Dinner . He knockt at the Door about a 11 at Night , and she desir 'd me not to let him in , for she was resolved never to Bed with him any more , but he continuing to knock and call , she let him in herself . When he came up , he asked her why she let him stand to long at the Door , and said something to her about what he 'd do to the other Woman , which I believe the Deceas 'd was pleas 'd with , for I heard her Laugh , after which they went quietly to Bed together . A man call 'd at the Door about 3 in the morning , and she look 'd out of the Window and said , he had been gone an Hour , but whether he was then gone , or she only deny 'd him to keep him within I am not certain , but I did not hear her go to Bed again . About 4 she open 'd her Garret Door , and went down as I suppose with the Chamber Pot , and I think I heard no body else go out ; She soon came up again in a sort of a hurry , and set the Pot upon the Stair-head , and went down a second time , and shut the Door after her . Sarah Smith the Daughter of the Deceas 'd thus depos 'd . About 8 a Clock on Monday Morning , the Prisoner came to me at my Mistress 's and told me my Mother was very bad , and desired to Speak with me , I asked when she was taken ill , and he answer 'd About one in the Morning . Our work was in hast , and my Mistress did not care to let me go , except there was a great occasion , and says I , Is my Mother dangerously Ill ? What ails her ? To which he made no answer , but by and by all on a sudden he said , It signifies nothing to hide it any longer , - She 's dead , she has Cut her own Throat , and lies in Farthing Fields . Then my Mistress let me go with him , and by the way he talk 'd if he fear 'd that some People would think hard of him , about my Mothers Death , and I said , if there was any danger , he had better go out of the way , No says he , that will look as if I was Guilty , but if I stay , it with took as if I was Innocent . In Church Lane we met a Creature that ask 'd him to drink , I told her , he could not go with her then , and the swore he should , upon which he promis 'd to meet her at a House in King-street in about 2 hours ; Then , says she . There is a Woman murder 'd , - I know it , says he , and this is her Daughter , meaning me , and so they parted . I ask 'd him who that Woman was , and he said it was his Daughter ; As we went forward , several call 'd after us , and said , That 's the Old Rogue that murder 'd his Wife , and so at last he was apprehended in Rateliffe High-way . Mr. Thomas the Surgeon thus depos 'd . The Wound in the Deceas 'd Throat was very slight , it was about 2 Inches long , and just penetrated the Skin , without dividing any of the large Vessels . One side of her Head appear 'd to be tumify 'd which I take to be the cause of her Death , for I found no water in her Stomach , which there would have been if she had been Drowned , or had breathed under water . The Prisoner thus made his Defence . The Deceas 'd was not my Wife , I parted from her about Midnight , and took my Shovel in my Hand , for at 2 a Clock I was to heave Ballast a-broad a Ship , I went directly to Betty Thomas 's Room , and lay with her , she call 'd me about 2 a Clock , and said it was time for me to go and heave Ballast . I thought it was hardly worth while to rise so soon for an Eight-penny Jobb , and so I lay still till between 5 and 6 in the Morning , and then I got up , and went over the Fields . I saw the Deceas 'd lying dead , and several People looking at her , I did not much wonder at it , because she had attempted to cut her Throat before . The Prisoner could not produce Betty Thomas to prove , that he was with her when the Deceas 'd was kill 'd , but he call 'd - Butcher , who depos 'd , that about 3 Months ago , he heard the Deceas 'd say , that she had a good mind to cut her own Throat , because her Husband ( the Prisoner ) was Jealous of her . The Jury Acquitted him . Hester George , was indicted for the Murder of her Bastard Male Infant , by throwing it into a Privy , where it was Suffocated and instantly dy 'd on the 28 of August last . She was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroners Inquisition for the said Murder . Isabel Brown thus depos 'd . I often told Mrs. Holiday , that I thought the Prisoner was with Child . - I went to see her one-Day when she was very ill , and had purging and vomiting , and there was Caudie in the Room , and then I believ 'd that she was brought to Bed . Mary Stanford thus depos 'd . On Sunday the 28th of August , between 7 and 8 in the Evening , I was sitting at my Door , which is next door to Mrs . Holidays in Pall-Mall , and her Maid Betty Franks was with me , and so up comes the Prisoner in a Riding Hood , and ask 'd me how I did , I told her I had been very ill , And so have I too , says she , and after a little more Chat , she desir 'd me to let her go to my necessary House , which I did , and she came back in about 2 Minutes , and staid talking with us about half a quarter of an Hour . On the 6 of September following , the Night Men came to empty the Vault , and found a Child , which they laid upon some Straw in the Yard , and said they must charge a Constable with it , before it was carried away . - It was a Male Child at its full Time , and I saw no bruises on it . William Brown the Night-man thus depos 'd . Mrs. Holiday 's Vault and this are both in one at the bottom , and there is only an Arch that parts then at top . I had empty 'd 6 Tun , and was about the 7th when as I sunk the Soil , I saw something pop out of Mrs . Holidays Vault , which at first I thought was a Dog , but when I brought it up in a Pail , I found it was a Child . I believe it had laid there 5 or 6 Weeks , though it appear 'd very fair , but I could give a pretty good ghess , because I had been such things before . Margaret Holiday thus depos 'd . When Isabel Brown told me that she believ 'd the Prisoner was brought to Bed , it was but about 7 or 8 Days before the Child was found ; I never saw any sign of her being with Child , and should never have mistrusted it , if Brown had not put it into my Head . Elizabeth Powell the Midwife thus depos 'd . The Child came at its full Time . I saw no hurt on it . It came into the World without the help of a Midwife , but whether born alive or dead , I can not tell . I ask 'd the Prisoner if she had ever had a Husband , she said no , I examin 'd her Breasts , and made her draw her Milk , which I carry 'd in my Hand to the Jury ; Then I told her , that she had had a Child . She said no , but she had miscarried about 5 Weeks ago , when she was 4 Months gone , which I could not contradict , for she might have had Milk , if it had been 8 or 10 Weeks after such a Miscarriage . The Prisoners Confession was then read in which she owns ; That being about 4 Months gone with Child , she fell down , in the Old Paved Alley in Pall-mall , and finding herself very much disorder 'd with a violent pain in her Back , she went into Mr. Bowchers Vault , ( which is not the Vault where the Child was found ) and there while she sat on the Seat , the Child dropt from her Body , which was what she did not expect when she went thither . The Prisoner thus made her Defence . I am Married , but my Husband is at Sea , I kept it private for fear of displeasing my Friends . - But when I found my self with Child , I spoke to Mrs. Southwell , to provide me with a Midwife and a Nurse , and often desired the first Witness Isabel Brown , to help me to some Child-Bed-Linnen , and some I made my self , which I have here to produce . Eliz . Southwell thus depos 'd . The Prisoner on the ninth of August last desired me to let her have my Room to lye inn , and to chuse her a Nurse and a Midwife . Isabel Brown thus depos 'd . The Prisoner has often asked me to help her to Child-Bed-Linnen ; and because I did not do it , she was very angry with me , and ask 'd me how I could serve her so , and that was all the reason that I had to suspect she was with Child . Ferdinand Lanson thus depos 'd . I lodge at Mrs. Holiday 's I have been several People who did not belong to the House , go to the Vault where the Child was found , for there is an open Passage to it . I always believed the Prisoner to be a very sober modest Woman . A great number of Witnesses appeared in favour of her Character , and the Jury acquitted her . George Rose , was indicted for assaulting Mary the Wife of Abraham Churchill on the Highway , and taking from her a Gold Ring , value 18 Shillings , Sept. 21 . The Witnesses thus depos 'd . Mrs. Churchill was going by the end of Bridges-street ( her Husband being a little behind ) the Prisoner catch 'd hold of her Hand , pull 'd off her Ring , and ran away . She cry 'd out stop Thief , he was taken , and dropt the Ring . Guilty of Felony . [ Transportation .

About eleven at Night , I met the Prisoner and another Woman upon London-Bridge , I was drunk you must know , and so I asked them to go and take a Pot with me . We went to an Ale-house ; but the Landlady would not let us have any Drink , for I suppose she did not like the Looks of us . Then the Prisoner said she 'd shew the way to a Brandy-shop ; but before I came there , one of them pick 'd my Pocket . I charged a Constable with her , and he found the Money in her Mouth . - I had never seen the Prisoner before that Time . The Constable depos 'd , that he took the Money from the Prisoner , and she in her Defence said that the Prosecutor had been several times in her Company , and commonly twice a Week ; that she was with Child by him , and he gave her the Money to provide for her Lying-inn .

Between five and six in the Morning , as I was standing at Mr. Scarlet 's Door in Picadilly , about 40 Yards from the Prisoner 's House ; The Deceas 'd ( who was a Gardener 's Boy about 19 Years Old ) was going along with a Whip in his Hand . As he was passing the Prisoner 's Door , a Dog came out from thence and ran at him . He whipt him , upon which the Prisoner came with a Candlestick in his Hand with a Candle in it about as long as my Finger . He collared the Boy , and struck him under the left Ear , with the Nosle end of the Candlestick . The Boy presently reel 'd and fell down backwards on his Head . The Prisoner took him up and went for a Surgeon . Martha Meridith thus depos 'd . The Boy went along smacking his Whip , and whistling and singing like a Nightingale , the Dog ran at him , and he whipt him . The Prisoner came out , and said , Sirrah , what do ye whip the Dog for , and with that he struck the Boy ( I think , but I am not positive ) with the Foot of the Candlestick on the Right side of the Head . The Boy Stagger 'd , fell down , and gasped . I bid him fetch a Surgeon , and he went from me , and left the Boy to the care of a Chairman , I was within 4 or 5 yards when the Blow was given . James Keller thus depos 'd . I keep the Hamtshire-Hog next Door to the Prisoner . Mr. Jewit called for a point of Purl , and sat down on the Beach . - When I brought it up , the Prisoner said to me , Did ye ever see such a sad Accident ? How came it ? says 1 . Why , says he , I struck him only with my Hand . Then he had me look on the Deceas'd 's Head , and see if any hurt was done to him , but I could see no Mark at all . Arthur Jewit thus depos 'd . After the Boy had whipt the Dog , the Prisoner came out with a Candlestick in his right Hand , and endeavoured to take away the Whip ; they strugled together , and he struck the Boy once with his left Hand , but I did not see any Blow given with the Candlestick ; but after the stroke , the Boy Stood two pulls for the Whip , and then losing his hold , he reel 'd towards the Kennel and fell . Thomas Berry the Deceased 's Brother depos 'd , that the Deceased told him on his Death-bed , that the Prisoner struck him with the Candlestick , and that he forgave him , but desir 'd he might suffer the Law . Several Surgeons depos 'd that the Deceased had an Apoplectick fit ; that they had his Head shaved and made and Incision , but found no Fracture nor any signs of the Head being hurt . - But when he was dead , they opened his skull , and found much extravasated Blood in the Brain . From thence they suppos 'd that the Blow receiv 'd in the Fall , occation 'd a great Concussion of the Brain , by which means some of the small Vessels were broke .
