Anne Markham . I miss 'd my Goods out of a Shew Glass at the Shop Window , and about a Week afterwards , Elizabeth Willoughby , a Girl , came and told me , that she and Rebecca Cockburn , and the two Prisoners , stole them ; on her Information the Prisoners were apprehended . Elizabeth Willoughby . When I was a little Creature , I was put out Apprentice by the Parish to a Woman in the Mint , that sells Fish and Pork , and Butter and Eggs , & c. and so one Night I ran away from my Mistress , and coming into Gracechurch-street , who should I meet but Sue Bean , Chrissy Smith , and Beck Cockburn ; and so says Save , Lord ! Bess Willoughby ! where are ye going ? Why , I do n't know , says I , why then go along with us ye little Bitch , and so I e'en went with them till we came as far as Mr. Markham 's Shop , and then 3 of us stood on the other side of the Way , while Sue Bean went over and lifted up the Shew Glass , and took out the Watch , and then Beck Cockburn went and got the Snuff Boxes , and so away we went to White-Chapel , and there we found Ballad-singing Jack , and he took us to Rag-Fair to sell the Things . He offer 'd them first to Sarah Whitlow , but she had no ready Money to buy them , and we did not care to trust . We went to another Pawnbroker , but she was a Bed , and would not get up . Then we went to Mrs. Radford 's for a Lodging , but she would not let us lye there , and so we came away again . Then Jack says , I 'll go and see if Radford will buy the Things , but do you stand at a Distance , for , if she sees you , she wo n't meddle with them . Well , Sir , says we to Jack , do you go by your self , and make as good a Bargain as you can . So away goes Jack , and by and by he comes again , and tells us she would give 2 Guineas and a half . Well , Sir , says we , take the Money if you can get no more , and so he goes again and brings us the Money ; and now , says he , you ought to give me the odd half Guinea for my Pains : No , Sir , says we , you are a little too hard with us then , we think 6 s. is pretty well ; so we gave him 6 s. and went to share the rest among our selves , but could not agree about it . Whereof , says Jack , do n't make a Noise here , but go by your selves and share the Money , except you 'll go with me to my Lodgings in Kent-street , and there I 'll make a Fire with a whole Peck of Coals and a Faggot . No , Sir , says I , we thank you for your Love , but I do n't care to venture on that side of the Water , for fear of meeting with my Mistress ; and so we left Jack , and went to a Tavern Door to divide the Money , and there we quarrelled about it ; whereof I went to Mrs. Markham some time after , and inform 'd her of the whole ; and she went to Mrs. Radford 's to search for the Goods , but could not find them . There being no Evidence to affect the Prisoners but that of Bess Willoughby the Jury acquitted 'em . John Stockwell , a Butcher , of St. Peter 's , Cornhall , was indicted for stealing 300 Weight of Beef-Suet , the Goods of his Mistress , Alice Bennet , the 19th of November last . And the Fact being fully proved , the Jury found him Guilty . [ Transportation .

Henry Clark depos 'd , That I met the Prisoner on the Sunday Night in Lime-street ; my Dear , says she , wo n't you make me a Present ? Why , I do n't care if I do , says I , and so I made her a Present of 3 d. and as we stood talking together a little friendly , I catched her Hand in my Pocket , and presently I miss 'd a Guinea and a half , and 18 d. and this Hatband . I found the Hatband upon her , but none of the Money , and so I called a Constable , and not thinking it proper to charge her with the Money , I only indicted her for the Hatband . The Prisoner said before the Justice , that she was wrongfully accused of the Guinea and half , but the 18 d. she knew of ; the Jury acquitted her . Peter Bell , a Boy , of St. Mildred 's , Poultry , was indicted for privately stealing from Sarah Bartlet two Guineas and a half , and 16 s. the Money of her Husband , Robert Bartlet , the 24th of November last .

[ Transportation . See summary . ] John Potter , a Soldier , of St. Sepulchre 's , was indicted for marrying Mary Paget , on the 2d of April , in the third Year of the King , his former Wife Martha Robingon being Alive ; there being no Body to prove the two Marriages , but the two Women , who laid Claim to the Prisoner ; and as the first , if she was lawfully married , could not be an Evidence against her Husband ; and as he could not be convicted of a second Marriage before the first was proved , the Jury acquitted him . Thomas Lugroof , of Sunbury , was indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for feloniously slaying William Hooper , by Beating , bruising , and casting him Headlong down a Cellar , by which Fall he received one mortal Fracture in the crown of his Head , of the Length of six Inches , and Depth of half an Inch , of which he instantly died , the 20th of October last . The Prisoner and the Deceased ( both Bargemen ) were wrestling together ( not in Malice , but only to try their Strength ) at the Magpye in Sunbury , and they both fell down the Cellar Stairs , the Prisoner first , and the Deceased over him , by which Fall the Deceased struck his Head against a Butt of Beer , and fractured his Scull , and died immediately .

William Whitnell . I help 'd Mr. Wayman on his Horse at the Bell at Kilburn , about Four o'Clock on Sunday Morning , he was Drunk , and he paid his Reckoning a little before , and I saw him have a Green Purse with Gold in it . John Rush . I and two more found Mr. Wayman lying in the Road about a Mile from Kilburn , he was black in the Face , and stone Dead ; we searched his Pockets , and found his Watch ( 't was then past 6 o'Clock ) and 2 s. but no Purse , nor Gold . Joseph Edwards . The Prisoner was committed to New-Prison on Suspicion of murdering and robbing Mr. Wayman . I saw him there , and he said he was innocent of the Murder , but own 'd he took the Money , which was 5 l. 2 s. 6 d. and threw the Purse away for fear it should betray him . Was he Dead , says I ; no , says he , for he rattled in the Throat , and I thought I might as well take the Money as leave it for another . Thomas Finch . Going from London on Sunday Morning , I met the Prisoner at Hounslow-Whelm , beyond Paddington-Hill , between Five and Six ; and two or three Miles farther I found the Deceased lying in the Road . When the Prisoner was before the Justice , he at first deny 'd that he met me , but afterwards confess 'd it , and that he found the Deceased on the Road . I ask 'd if he was Dead , he said , no , he guggled in the Throat ; and how , says I , could you leave your Fellow-Dumb-Creature in that Condition ? He made no answer to that , but said he found the Purse 2 or 3 Yards from the Deceased ; and taking out the Money , threw the Purse on the Dunghill ; I went with him to the Dunghill , and found it . Prisoner . As I was coming from Stanmore towards London , I found the Deceased lying in the Road , I thought he was only Drunk , but raising him up , I found he was Dead , and going a few Yards further , I kick 'd a Purse before me ; I took it up , and emptied it , and then threw it on the Dunghill ; the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . [ Transportation . See summary . ] , of St. Magnes the Martyr , was indicted for stealing 19 Yards of broad Cloth , value 10 l. the Goods of Thomas and Stephen Cooper , the 11th of October last . The Prosecutors having lost several Quantities of Cloth , suspected the Prisoner , who was Servant to a Cloth-worker , and frequently came to their Shop to fetch Cloth to be dress 'd . They set a Man in a private place to watch , and he saw the Prisoner take 5 Yards of superfine Broad Cloth , wrapt it up in his Bundle , and carry it out , but did not let him go far before he oblig 'd him to come back to the Shop , when the Goods were found upon him . He begged hard for pardon , and protected it was the first Crime that he had been Guilty of ; but being strictly examined , he at last confess 'd that he had taken several Parcels before that time , and sold them to - Wynn , a Piece-broker , behind St. Clement 's , where they were found . The Jury found him Guilty to the Value of 39 s. [ Transportation .

A large Quantity of Lead was found in a Boat at the Bottom of the Stairs . The Boat belong 'd to William Manister of Hammersmith , who had left it that Night at the Strand-Bridge , from whence it was stolen .

He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Elizabeth Carter . I saw the first and the last Blow . There were but two Blows in all , and the Prisoner gave them both . The second Blow was on the left Breast of the Deceased , on receiving which he fell down dead . Nathaniel Edwards The Prisoner was sitting on his Coach-Box in Cornhill , his Coach standing in Rank as usual , when the Deceased came along driving a Whitster 's Cart with Linen in it . He could not pass without crossing the Way , and in crossing his Cart-Wheel accidentally brush 'd against the hind Wheel of the Prisoner 's Coach . The Prisoner damn 'd him , came off the Coach-box , and , without any Provocation , struck him three or four Blows , with the last of which he knock 'd him down , and he stirred no more . George Davis . The Prisoner was sitting on his Coach-box , when the Deceased , with his Cart , cross 'd the Way behind him , betwixt his Coach and another , and in passing the Cart Wheel brush 'd the hind Wheel of the Prisoner 's Coach . The Prisoner came down in a violent Passion , and damning the Deceased , asked him what he meant by it , and struck him 3 or 4 Blows . The Deceas 'd held up his Hands , trembling , as if to guard himself , but without once offering to strike the Prisoner , and then turning up the white of his Eyes fell down dead . John Hatch . The Wheel of the Deceased 's Cart , in crossing the Street , brush 'd the Wheel of the Prisoner 's Coach . The Prisoner got off his Coach-box , and struck the Deceased 3 or 4 Blows . The Deceased held up his Hands to save himself , but did not strike one Blow . The Street was pretty clear , and I saw the whole Transaction . Mr. Middleton , Surgeon . At the Desire of some Persons , I open 'd the Deceased 's Head to see if there was any sign of his receiving his Death by the Fall ; but found nothing like it , not the least Mark to give a Suspicion ; but on opening the Breast , I found several Contusions in the Thorax , a large Quantity of coagulated Blood , and a great many Vessels broke , which I believe were the Cause of his Death . Prisoner . I had no Malice against the Deceas 'd , for I never saw him before . I thought he had broke the Wheel of my Coach ; I came down and ask 'd him the Reason of it . He gave me gross Language , and struck me first . I drew back , and he follow 'd me , and then I made a Stand and struck him again . George Benskin . In crossing the Way , the Cart Wheel hitch 'd in , and jamm 'd against the Coach-Wheel , and gave it a sort of a Jerk . I saw the Deceased strike , as well as the Prisoner , but do n't know how often , or which struck first . But since the Accident , as I was drinking with the Deceased 's Brother , he asked me if I would swear that the Deceased struck the Prisoner ? I said , Yes ; and upon that he gave me a Slap o ' the Face . Mr. Hoper . As I was standing at my own Door , I saw the Deceased strike the Prisoner several Blows with as much Vehemence as ever I saw in my Life .

Several Blows pass 'd betwixt 'em , and the Prisoner retreated three or four Yards . Mary Curtis . Several Blows were given by both . William Evans , a Hackney Coachman . I stood in Rank and let the Deceased through betwixt me and the Prisoner . As the Deceased turn 'd his Cart , the Wheel run against the Prisoner 's Coach Wheel .

[ Transportation . See summary . ] Thomas Coventry , and Elizabeth Bird , of St . Brides , were indicted for stealing 9 s. 6 d. the Money of John Perry , the 27th of October last . The Prisoner Bird came to the Shop of the Prosecutor ( a Pastry-Cook ) about 6 at Night , and order 'd eighteen pennyworth of Pies to be sent to the Bell-Savage Inn on Ludgate-Hill , with Change for half a Guinea . James Grant , the Prosecutor 's Boy , was sent with the Pies , without the Change , as supposing he might get Change at the Inn . He went to the Tap-house at the Inn , but found no body there that sent for the Pies . As he was returning , he met Coventry , the other Prisoner , under the Gate-way , My Lad , says Coventry , have ye brought the Pies ? Yes , Sir , says the Boy , but I can find no body that wants 'em . O ! says Coventry , you went to the wrong Place ; they should go to that House ( pointing to a House in the Inn-Yard ) but have you brought Change ? No , says the Boy , I thought I could get Change at the Inn . Then I ca n't pay for the Pics , says Coventry , for I have been at every House hereabouts for Change , but ca n't get it , and therefore you must go back again , and fetch some . The Boy went home again , and related what had pass 'd between him and Coventry . The Family in the House Coventry pointed to were Customers to the Prosecutor , which gave the less Suspicion , and the Boy was sent again with Change , but with a Caution , however , not to deliver the Change , or Pies , till he had the half Guinea . In returning he met the Prisoner Bird ; What , says she , ha n't ye carried the Pies yet ? No , says he , I have been back for Change . Well , says she , give me the Pies , and I 'll take care of 'em . He was unwilling to part with 'em , but she got 'em from him , and presently up comes Coventry , and ask 'd him for the Change . You shall have it , says the Boy , but give me the half Guinea first ; upon which Coventry fumbled in his Pocket a little , and then suddenly gave the Boy a Punch on his Breast , snatch 'd the Money out of his Hand , and ran away . The Boy then kept close to the Woman , who led him thro ' several Streets , under Pretence of looking for the Man , till thinking she had an Opportunity to escape , she threw down the Pies in Gillspur-street , and said , Now catch me if you can . He cry 'd out , Stop Thief ! and she was taken . The Jury found them guilty . Joseph Paterson , alias Paternoster , and Joseph Darvan , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , were indicted for stealing 7 Linen Waistcoats , value 10 l. the Goods of our Sovereign Lord the King ; and a Linen Petticoat , the Goods of Mary Lamb , in the House of our Sovereign Lord the King , the 19th of November last . Ann Smith . The Goods mentioned in the Indictment were left from a Ground-Room in his Majesty 's Laundry at St. James 's . We suppose they were taken out at the Window , because the Sash was lifted up . They were afterwards taken on the Prisoners . I know these Waistcoats to be the same , here is the Mark G. R . under a Crown . Daniel Blunt . I belong to Surrey County-Goal . Mary Callicant , alias Nowland , was apprehended ( for offering to sell some Goods that were stolen from Mr. Northook ) and committed to our Goal . And hoping to be made an Evidence , she gave me Information of the Prisoners . 'Go , says she , to the Three Cranes ' in Castle-Lane , Westminster , and enquire ' where Mrs. Ram lives , Paternoster and Darvan ' lodge up one pair of Stairs in her ' House . If you do n't find 'em there , go to ' the Horse-shoe behind Green 's Free-school , and ' if you miss of 'em there too , desire the People ' of the House to tell you where Mr. ' Morris the Shoe-maker lives , for they often ' meet at his House . Paternoster is a young ' Man with a bald Head , he wears a fair ' Wig , an out-side light Drab Coat , with a ' great Cape , his under Clothes are Snuff-colour , ' and sometimes blue Grey turn 'd up ' with Black , a Silver Watch with a Crimson ' String . Darvan is a young Lad near 19 ' Years of Age , pretty well set , wears a light ' Wig , a new Hat with a Silver Loop and ' Button , a blue grey Coat , and a work 'd ' Waistcoat ; and sometimes an olive-colour 'd ' Suit . Each of 'em wears a small Diamond-Ring . ' I took these Directions in Writing , and went to the Three Cranes in Castle Lane . Mr. Cook , who keeps that House , is a Constable . I took him and James Ogilby with me , and went to Mrs. Ram 's in the Morning , and asking her if her Lodgers were within , went directly up Stairs , push 'd open the Chamber-Door , and found 'em in Bed . We secur 'd 'em , and then search 'd the Room . Their Hats , Wigs , Clothes , Watches and Rings , and their Persons , answer 'd Callicant 's Description ; and yet with horrible Oaths and Imprecations they protected at first that they never knew nor heard of such a Woman as Callicant ; but afterwards confess 'd that they were acquainted with her . In the Drawers we found these 7 Holland Waistcoats , mark 'd G R , with a Crown at top . One of the Crowns is partly pick 'd out ; above 20 Pair of Stockings , Mens and Womens , Silk , Thread and Worsted ; some Womens Linen , and several other Sorts of Goods . I examin 'd how they came by them . They said they bought the Mens Apparel for their own wearing , and the Womens Clothes were their Wives . Edmund Cook , Constable . I saw the same Goods taken in the Prisoner 's Room , and among them these Wires roll 'd up thus . They are about 3 or 4 Foot long , when pull 'd out , and there 's a Hook at one End . They seem very proper to draw Goods out at a Window when they lie too far within a Room to be reach 'd by the Hand only . James Ogilby . I saw the same Things found in the Prisoners Possession . Mary Ram . I live in Castle-Lane , ( some call it Cabbage-Lane ) in Westminster . The Prisoners were my Lodgers ; they were recommended to me by Mr. Morris the Shoe-maker , who said they were Gentlemen 's Sons , and had 700 l. left 'em by their Godmothers . They kept pretty good Hours . But one Night they came home about 6 , went up with a Candle , lock 'd the Door , staid about half an Hour , went out again with the Key , and return 'd between 2 and 3 in the Morning . I was a Bed when they came , and they wanted to light a Candle , but I huff 'd 'em for staying out so late , and so they went to Bed in the dark . I ask 'd 'em one day what they did with those Wives , and they said they went a fishing with them . Prisoner , J . Darvan . We do n't deny that the Goods were found in our Room , but that we brought 'em there . Mrs. Ram could open the Door without our Key . I came home one Night about 9 a Clock , and found the Room washed . I asked her how she got in when we had the Key ? She said she open 'd the Door with her own Key . Mary Ram . That was only once , when they had lost the Key , and order 'd me to get another . I never was in the Room by my self , at any other time . Prisoners . Did we deny you the Key ? Mary Ram . No . The Jury found them guilty to the value of 39 s. [ Transportation .

Ann Sheppard . The Goods were left in the Kitchin Window in Mrs. Lingard 's House . A Pane of Glass was taken out of the Window , and the Goods carried off , and I advertiz 'd 'em , and Mr. Cook , the Constable , brought 'em to me . Daniel Blunt . As we were searching the Prisoners Room ( of which I gave some Account in the last Trial ) I saw Paternoster have some wet Linen in his Hand , which he went to hide behind the Table . Who does that belong to ? says I . Why , to my Wife , says he ; these are her Headclothes . Your Wife ! says I , ( and took 'em from him ) does your Wife wear such Linen as this ? - This is the same Linen ; here 's 14 Pieces of 'em . Edmund Cook , Constable . On reading the Advertisement I carried this Linen to Mrs. Sheppard , who own 'd it . Among other Things , I found this Diamond Pen in the Room . I suppose it is to cut Glass . Paternoster . I was never married , and therefore could not say that the Linen was my Wife 's . James Ogilby . He said then that his Wife was a Cork-cutter in the Strand . Mary Ram . She that went for his Wife liv 'd near St. Clement 's Church . Prisoners . 'T is no such thing . When we were apprehended , they took all our Clothes and Watches from us , which we can prove we bought , and honestly paid for , and therefore we hope we shall have 'em return 'd to us .

Henry Burnell . On Tuesday Evening , as I was going along Great Russel-Street , near Montague House , the Prisoner came up , clapt a Pistol to my Breast , and demanded my Money . I gave him about 16 s. and a Silver Medal . I am one of the Directors of the Hand-in-Hand Fire-Office , and every Director has such a Medal given him , on shewing of which to the Fire-men , they know his Authority , and readily observe his Orders . After I had given the Prisoner my Money , he demanded my Watch ; which I not delivering readily , he stoop 'd , and taking hold of the Chain , I seiz 'd his Pistol-Hand ; we struggled together ; he got loose , and presented his Pistol , but it did not go off . I stepp 'd back a little , and drew my Sword . He ran down Queen-street . I cry 'd , Stop Thief ! He was taken , and brought to an Ale-house , where the Medal and 13 Shillings was found upon him . It was Moon-light , and I took such Notice of the Person who robb 'd me , that I am certain the Prisoner is the Man . William Dolman , a Patten-maker . I was standing at Mr. Bell 's ( a Butcher ) Shop , where a Boy came and said , Mr. Bell , there 's somebody robbing a Gentleman under Montague House . I stept out with my Stick , and met the Prisoner running with a Pistol in one Hand , and a Hanger in t'other . He swore he wou 'd drive me , if I did not keep off . But I struck at him with my Stick , and he at me with his Hanger , and then he made off . I pursu 'd him , he struck at me again , I kick 'd up his Heels , and then several others came in to my Assistance . We carry 'd him to an Ale house , where he was search 'd , and 13 Shillings and this Medal found upon him . A Pistol was brought thither by a Boy , who said he found it where the Prisoner fell . I asked the Prisoner if it was charged ? He said , yes ; but it was only with Sparrow-shot , so that it could not do much Hurt if it went off . Broughill . I was at the Coach and Horses Alehouse in Bloomsbury , over-against Mr. Bell 's , when the Boy came and said there was a Robbery . I went out , saw Mr. Dolman running after the Prisoner , and struck him . I follow 'd close , and kick 'd at the Prisoner 's Heels as he turn 'd a Corner . He was seiz 'd , brought to the Alehouse , and some Money and a Medal found upon him . George Hunt . I heard the Outcry , and pursued the Prisoner . He struck me with the flat side of his Hanger , and Mr. Dolman struck him , and made him reel ; but he recover 'd , and ran forward , till Mr. Dolman kick 'd up his Heels , at which time he threw away his Pistol . We found upon him 13 s. this Medal , and this Bag of Gunpowder . Israel Pain , a Chairman . I came in to their Assistance when I saw three of them down together . - Holder . I live at the Hand and Heart over-against where the Robbery was committed . Two Boys gave the Alarm , upon which the Prisoner was pursued and taken . The Prisoner ask 'd some of the Witnesses if they had not said ( since his Commitment ) that they could not know him again if they saw him ? They answer 'd , No . He then own 'd that they found the Medal upon him , and said that he had no more to say . The Fact being plainly proved , the Jury found him Guilty . Death . Robert Nowland , of Christ-Church , was indicted , and Patrick Nowland ( his Father ) of the same Parish , was a 2d time indicted for breaking and entering the House of William Durant , in the Day-time , several Persons being therein , and taking from thence 3 Sheets , 3 Shirts , 15 Napkins , 7 Aprons , 1 Calamancoe Gown , 7 Silk Gown , 1 large Silver Spoon , 2 Tea Spoons , 1 Strainer , 1 pair of Silver Tongs , 1 Silver Thimble , 1 Silver Pen , 1 pair of Silver Buckles , 1 Tortoise-shell Snuff-Box , and 1 Gold Ring , the Goods of William Durant ; and 1 Silver Candlestick , value 5 l. the Goods of the Parishioners of Christ-Church , the 29th of October last . William Durant . I am Sexton of Christ-Church , I live in the Vestry-House in Butcher-Hall-Lane , at the Back of the Church ; and there 's a way thro ' to the Church . On the 29th of October , I attended at my Lord Mayor 's Shew , and when I came Home I soon heard that my House had been robb 'd . Next Day I went in quest of my Goods among the old Clothes Shops in Chick-Lane , and left a Description of what I had lost . Soon after I was sent for to Mr. Savages , where the Prisoner , Patrick Nowland , came to offer my Calamancoe Gown to Sale . Jane Durant . When my Husband was gone to my Lord Mayor 's Show , I went out too about Twelve , and return 'd about One , and found my Doors broke open , and my Goods gone . Sarah Hospital . I saw Patrick Nowland and another Man walking to and for in the Lane for two Hours , and afterwards I saw them come down the Stairs with a great Bundle . Patrick went up the Lane , and the other follow 'd at a little Distance . Susan Hains . I saw Patrick and another go into Christ-Church Vestry [ the Prosecutor 's House ] as if they were going into the Church , but they came back again , and went up Stairs . Then the youngest of them came down and stood in the Door-way , and the other ( which was Patrick ) look 'd out of the Window , and by and by he came down with a Bundle in his Hand , and went out , and the other follow 'd . Thomas Fench . The Prisoner Patrick came to my Master Savages in Chick-Lane , to fell some old Clothes , and there being some Things among 'em like what the Prosecutor had left Descriptions of , I sent for him while I detain 'd the Prisoner , and he came and own 'd some of them , and other People came afterwards and own 'd the rest . The Prisoner , Patrick , in his Defence said , that he bought the Goods in Manmouth-street of William Trevors . [ This William Trevors was then a Prisoner in Newgate , but this Trial being a little before the Bill of Indictment was found against him , he was admitted to give Evidence . ] William Trevors . I heard the Prisoner Patrick crying old Clothes in Monmouth-street , and called to him , and sold him this Gown and other Things , which I and John Kelly , Thomas Kelly , and Francis Norris stole out of the Prosecutor 's House . Court . Where did you live then ? Trevors . At the Prisoner Patrick 's House . It appear 'd that Trevors was a most notorious Rogue , and belong 'd to Patrick 's Gang ; and that last Sessions he was try 'd for robbing the Dog Tavern in Newgate-street , when Patrick was an Evidence for him . The Evidence not being sufficient against Robert Nowland , the Jury acquitted him , and found Patrick Guilty . Death . Patrick Nowland , of St. Andrew 's Holborn , was a third time indicted for stealing a pair of Stays , a Sattin Gown , and a Linen Gown , the Goods of Anne Blague ; a Cloth Coat , the Goods of Joseph Knot ; and a pair of Calamancoe Shoes , the Goods of Mary Adderly , the 28th of October last . Anne Blague . I lost the 2 Gowns and Stays , and the Prisoner was taken in offering them to Sale at Mr. Savages , the Golden Key , in Chick-Lane . Thomas Fench , Savages Man . The Prisoner brought these Goods to sell with those of Mr. Durant 's , and I stopt them all together . Joseph Knot . I lost this Coat , and found it again at Mr. Savages . Thomas Fench . The Prisoner brought that Coat to my Master to sell . Mary Adderly . I lost a Hat and Wig , and this pair of Shoes . Constable . These Shoes I found in the Prisoner 's own Lodging , in Abel 's Buildings in Rosemary-Lane . Prisoner . I bought all these Goods of William Trevors . Trevor . 'T is very true , for I and my Partners stole them all , and sold them to the Prisoner . But notwithstanding this , the Jury found him Guilty . Death . William Trevor , and Robert Nowland , alias Nowls , of St. Andrew 's Holbourn , were indicted for breaking and entring the House of Thomas Gibson , in the Day time , no Person being therein , and stealing from thence a Cloth-Coat , value 3 l. a Pair of Breeches , a Waistcoat , a Pair of Stockings , 2 Shirts , a Table-Cloth , 2 Sheets , and 7 Guineas , the Goods and Money of Thomas Gibson , the 2d of November last . At the Request of the Prisoners , the Witnesses for the Prosecutor were examined separately . Thomas Gibson . On the 2d of November last , about 10 in the Morning , I lock 'd my Room Door , and went from home . I return 'd between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , and found my Door wrench 'd open , and my Goods gone . The Prisoner Trevor confess 'd the Fact before the Justice . Then Trevor 's Confession was read in Court , in which he says , ' That John Kelly , ' Thomas Kelly , Francis Norris , and himself , ' broke open and robb 'd a House in Pall-mall , ' one in St. Giles 's , one opposite Stocks-Market , ' one at the Dog Tavern on Ludgate-Hill , ' for which he was try 'd last Sessions , ' and acquitted ; two in Thomas-Street , and ' one in a Lane in Newgate-Street , these three ' in one Day ; one in Shoe-Lane , one in Drury-Lane , ' and one opposite to the back Door of St. ' Andrew 's Church , in Holbourn ' . This last is that for which he is now indicted . Elizabeth Johnson . I lodge in Mr. Gibson 's House . The outer Door opens into an Entry . I went out on the Day laid in the Indictment , a little after 3 in the Afternoon , and return 'd a little after 4 , when I found the Door open , the Entry dirty , and heard a Bustle above , when presently the Prisoner Nowland came down , and another , which I think was Trevor , follow 'd him with a Bundle , he past by me so quick , that I had not leisure to take Notice of him , so that I can not be positive that he was the Man ; but Nowland stood at the Door with me , I believe , 5 Minutes . I ask 'd him , Who that Man was that went out with the Bundle ? I do n't know who he is , says he , but he went up Stairs to a fat Man . And who do you want ? says I . A young Woman , says he , her Name is Elizabeth - a - What d 'ye call her ? I ca n't think of her Name at present , but she lately married a Weaver . There 's no such Person lives here , says I ; and so he went away , and I went up one pair of Stairs , and saw Mr. Gibson 's Door and his Drawers broke open . - Cranwell , the Constable . I went with a Search Warrant to Patrick Nowland 's House , in quest of Mr. Durant 's Goods . There I met Trevor , and seeing a Bundle of Goods , I ask 'd him , what it was ? 'T is a Bundle , says he , that I brought in just now . I soon after saw Mr. Gibson 's Advertisement , and the Description agreed with that Bundle . Nowland . I was left out in Trevor 's Information . He says there , that he and John , and Thomas Kelly , and Francis Norris committed the Fact , and therefore I can not be Guilty . Trevor . I was promis 'd to be made an Evidence when I gave in my Information , and therefore I think it 's hard to be try 'd for any Thing that I confess 'd at that Time . The Jury found them both Guilty . Death . Samuel Cole , and Edward Paine , of St. Sepulchres , were indicted for assaulting William Brown on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Watch , value 40 s. a Chain , value 5 s. a Seal , value 4 s. and 16 s. in Money , the 9th of November last . William Brown . On the 9th of November last , about 9 o'Clock at Night . I was passing in a Coach along the Horse-Market in Smithfield , when the Coach was stopp 'd by 3 Men . Cole open 'd the Door , and clapping a Pistol to my Breast , said , G - d d - n your blood ! your Money ! and then he came into the Coach , and took 16 Shillings and my Watch . Pain , the other Prisoner , stood at the Door at the same time , in a red Coat , and the 3d Man stood by the Horses with a Pistol in his Hand . I could see them plainly by the Lights in the Shops , for it was not far from the Houses . Samuel Cole . When I was before the Justice , the Prosecutor deny 'd that he knew me . William Brown . No . Being fetch 'd in a hurry before the Justice , I said then , that I verily believed that you , was the Man . But I was not so positive then as I am now , I have fully recollected my Memory . P - J - . I and the 2 Prisoners stopp 'd the Coach , and committed the Robbery . Pain stood by with a Pistol , while Cole open 'd the Coach Door , went in , and robb 'd the Prosecutor of his Watch , and 8 s. as he told me ; for if he took more he sunk it . From thence we went and drank together at Mr. Oads 's , at the Goat in Black-Boy-Alley , in Chick-Lane . Pain . He swears I had a Pistol when I stood by the Coach ; 't is false , I had nothing in my Hand but a Stick . - Oads . P - , and the 2 Prisoners were at my House together ; they seem 'd to be acquainted with one another . Pain is a Beef Carrier , and goes by the Name of Jumbo . - Bistow . I live in Parker's-Lane . Cole and P - lodged together at my House , I took them for 2 Sailors . - French . I keep an Alehouse in Cross-Lane . P - has been at my House in Company with the Prisoners . Pain . I could have but a short Acquaintance with I - , for I am but just come from Sea . What I know of him is , that he is a Cooper by Trade , and that when he was taken up , he deny 'd that he knew any thing of the Watch . Cole . I was taken up first about a Quarrel , and was the Cause of P - being apprehended ; but he had Friends . Richard Pointer . I am a Musician , or a Fidler , or what you please to call me . The Prisoner Pain , and I , have been Play-fellows . He told me , ( before he was charg 'd with the Robbery ) that he was surpriz 'd at what he had done a Night or two ago , when P - and Cole had drawn him into a Robbery . And I know that he apply 'd himself to catch them . Cole . This Fidler keeps a House to entertain Pick-pockets . William Brown . P - and Cole were taken in Moor-fields . I found my Watch at the Pawnbroker 's , to whom the Fidler directed me . Pawnbroker . P - brought the Watch to me , Pain and the Fidler came to enquire if I had taken it in . The Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found them both Guilty . Death . When the Jury gave their Verdict against Pain , he endeavour 'd to force a Smile , and said , G - d D - n all of ye ! my Lord Mayor and all . But when he came to receive Sentence , he begg 'd Pardon of the Court for his Rashness , and said he was drunk when he utter 'd those Expressions . George Mason , of St. Andrew 's Holbourn , was indicted for assaulting Anne Kendall on the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Bermudas Hat , value 5 s. and 2 s. in Money , the Goods and Money of her Husband Benjamin Kendall , the 5th of November last . Anne Kendall . On the 5th of November last , between 9 and 10 at Night , as I was crossing Holbourn from the Little-Turn-Stile , the Prisoner and 2 other Men stopp 'd me ; What do you want ? says I , and wish that he knock 'd me down , by giving me a punch in the Face with a Link , or some such Thing , for it stuck like Pitch , and then he took away my Hat . I catch 'd hold of his Great Coat , and recover 'd my self , for I was not willing to lose my Hat ; but he got away , and I follow 'd , and cry 'd , Stop Thief , and I kept him in Sight till he was taken by a Constable . I had ty 'd my Hat fast upon my Head with a Ribbon , and he pull 'd so hard that he left the Ribbon about my Neck . So when I came up to him again , the Constable took a Man 's Hat from under the Prisoner 's Great Coat , and said , Is this your Hat ? No , says I , mine is a Bermudas Hat , lined with blue Silk . I had not let him go so easily at first , but I had got a pair of Stays in my Apron , and I was afraid of losing 'em . I lost 2 s. besides , but I ca n't swear he had it . Edward Priddam . I heard a Woman cry , Stop Thief ! my Hat ! my Hat ! and saw the Prisoner running across the way ; I let him pass me , and then seiz 'd him . Presently the Prosecutrix came up to us with a String about her Neck , and accus 'd him of Robbing her . I found a black Hat under his Great Coat , but the Woman said that was not her 's , for that her 's was a Bermudas Hat lin 'd with blue Silk , and that the Prisoner had pitch 'd her Face with a Link . I look 'd on the Ground , and within two Yards found this Bermudas Hat , which she presently said was her 's . The Prisoner offer 'd to make himself an Evidence against his two Companions . Edward Bladen . As the Prosecutrix cross 'd Holbourn , I saw three Men attack her . She said be quiet , or I 'll cry out ; they thrust her into the middle of the Street , and the Prisoner pull 'd her Hat off , put it under his Arm , ran as fast as he could , and was not out of my Sight till he was taken . When he was in the Round-House , he at first said , that what they did was only in Rognery to have a little Fun with the old Woman , by pulling and hauling her about , and then letting her slipdown ; but afterwards he own 'd , that they thrust her into the middle of the Street , and knock 'd her down . Richard Faircloth . I assisted the Constable . As the Prisoner was going to the Round-House , he said , Now I am sorry for what I have done , I meant no begun , but I fear a great deal of hurt will some of it , for I did take the Woman 's Hat . Prisoner . I and two more were drinking at the Cow 's Face when the Prosecutrix came in Drunk , and would have pawn 'd a pair of Stays for some Liquor , for she said she had no Money ( tho ' now she swears that I robb 'd her of 2 s. ) But neither Mrs. Fowler , who keeps the House , nor her Man , would let her have any more . Richard Mason , the Prisoner 's Brother . The Man at the Cow 's Face told me the same thing . Abraham Mason . And he told me . Anthony Dennison . And me too . The Constable . And the same Man told me , that the Woman pull 'd out 2 s. that the Prisoner and his two Companions were three notorious Rogues , and that he would draw them no more drink , but turn 'd 'em out of Doors , for he would not have a Disturbance in his House . The Court . What was said by the Man or the Woman at the Cow 's Face is no Evidence on either side , except they were here to swear it themselves . Anthony Dennison . I have lived a great many Years in the Neighbourhood of the Prisoner and his Relations ; and I never heard any thing of this kind before . He 's a Weaver by Trade , and his Parents are honest industrious People . There was a Proposal to make him an Evidence against his two Companions , and a Council was see 'd to move it ; upon which the Constable said , If we should not prove the Fact against them , what a Case shall I be in ? I shall get nothing . Constable . No , I said I would act according to the Opinion of the Court , which I did , and found we had no Fact that we could fix upon the other two . Justice Hilder . The Prisoner was brought before me on a violent Suspicion of a Robbery . A Woman was knock 'd down and robbed by three Men , but could not tell which of them knocked her down . The Prisoner made an Information against the other two . Samuel Hubbard . The Constable and Prisoner consulted together about going to Hicks's-Hall to make the Prisoner an Evidence against Crank and Pace , his two Companions , but afterwards the Constable declin 'd it . - Wood . The Prisoner was my Prentice . I beat him once about not taking to his Business readily , and so he was turn 'd over to his Brother ; but I have heard no harm of him since till this Affair . Several Witnesses . The Prisoner work 'd at his Trade for a living , and we believ 'd him to be honest . The Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found him Guilty . Death . William Newell , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing five Yards of Mantua Silk , value 20 s. the Goods of Fanny Finnick , in the Shop of Christopher Cook , the 16th of November last . Mary Cook . Sitting in my Shop on Tuesday Night , the 16th of November last , I saw a Man 's Hand lift up the Sash , and take the Silk out of the Window ; I ran out , and cry 'd , Stop Thief . The Prisoner ran into an Alehouse Entry , and dropp 'd the Goods . Charles Glass . About a Quarter past Six , I heard my Mistress cry , Stop Thief . I follow 'd the Prisoner into an Entry , and took him in a Corner , as he was shuffling the Silk from him ; and while I secur 'd him , a Gentleman came in and took up the Silk . Prisoner . I made an Information in Expectation of being an Evidence . Justice Du Veil . I endeavour 'd to make the Prisoner confess his Accomplices , he was obstinate at first , but next Day he sent to me and discover 'd three Persons , who have since been try 'd and found Guilty . I would have had him to have been an Evidence then , but was inform 'd a Bill was found against him , so that it prov 'd too late . The Fact being plainly proved , the Jury found him Guilty . Death . John Norman and John Rogers , of St. George 's Bloomsbury , were indicted for assaulting John Mosely on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Seal , value 2 s. and 9 s. 8 d. in Money , the 17th of October last . John Mosely . On Sunday Night , the 17th of October , as I was passing along Southampton-Row in Bloomsbury , the Prisoners follow 'd me . Norman clapp 'd a Pistol to my Breast , and demanded my Money ; I told 'em I had none for them : Sir , says he , if you speak a Word more you are a dead Man . Rogers came on my Right-side , and took my Seal , and about 18 d , and unbutton 'd my Breeches , and took about 8 s. 6 d. more . D - n ye , says he , where 's your Watch ; I told 'em , I had none . They were going off , and I said to put up my Breeches . D - n ye , says Norman , what do ye stay for ? Go along , or I 'll shoot ye thro ' the Head . I moved forward , and they went away . This was about one hundred Yards of my own Lodgings . On Wednesday Night afterwards I heard that they were committed to th e Counter , and that they were taken by James Parrot , as they attempted to rob him in Bell-Alley , Coleman-street . Norman confess 'd in the Counter , that he had robb 'd me , I pick 'd him out , tho ' he was a Bed , from above a hundred ; several of whom pretended to be him . John Parrot . On the 20th of October , at Night , I took the Prisoners as they attempted to rob me in Bell-Alley , and found a Bill of Indictment against them for it ; but as a Cane was taken from me in the scuffle , I was advis 'd to find another against them for a Robbery ; but before it could be done , the Grand-Jury for London was discharged . Norman 's Confession before Sir William Billers was read , in which , he says , ' That on ' the 17th of October , he and Rogers , and Hunter , ' stopt a Man near Pancras , but finding ' no more than 9d . about him , they would ' not take it away . That the same Night , ' himself and Rogers robb 'd a Man ( the Prosecutor ) ' of 8s . 6d . in Bloomsbury , and on ' the 20th following , attempted to rob another ' Man ( John Parrot ) in Little-Bell-Alley , ' in which Fact they were taken . ' George Bray . I am a Packer by Trade , Rogers is my Apprentice , and has served me 5 Years and a half , and I believe he was an honest Servant to me . On the 11th of October last , being the King 's Coronation-Day , he work 'd all Day , and I gave him leave to go out at Night . He did not come home to Bed , and having heard that he had been in a Quarrel , and was beat and bruised , I thought he was asham 'd to be seen , and the next News was , that he was apprehended . Mr. Cockle . The Prisoner Rogers ( his Master being my Packer ) has done Business for me these five Years , and has had scarce over less than the value of 1000 l. of mine in his Custody , and it has been in his Power almost at any time , to wrong me of a 100 or 200 l. but I never had Cause to suspect him . Richard Chadwick . I have trusted Rogers with Goods to a great Value , and he has had frequent Opportunity to have robb 'd me , but I never knew that he wrong 'd me of a Farthing . The Jury found them guilty . Death . Thomas Woolcott , of St. George 's , was indicted for assaulting James Duffell on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him fifteen pence half-penny , the 15th of October last . James Duffell . On the 15th October , about 11 at Night , in Well-Close-Square , the Prisoner came out of a Turning and follow 'd me . When I came near a Lamp I made a Stand , and look 'd him full in the Face ; he had a Bar of a Window under his Arm , by which I took him to be some Carpenter 's Prentice . I saw another Man behind him at a Distance . The Watchman was then beating the Hour at the Corner of the Square , so that I was out of Fear ; but turning about , I had hardly gone 3 Steps when the Prisoner knock 'd me down , and struck me 4 or 5 Blows afterwards . Then he put his Hand in my left Pocket , and took out fifteen pence half-penny , which I had there . With scuffling and struggling , I had the good Luck to save my Watch in my Fob . The Watch came to my Assistance ( when the Prisoner was gone ) and carry 'd me to Mr. Sandford , a Surgeon , who dress 'd my Head . In 3 or 4 Days I called upon Mr. Sandford again to pay him for his Trouble . He told me that he had heard the Watchman say that he saw one of the Fellows run from me , and knew who he was . I sent for the Watchman , and describ 'd the Prisoner to him . The Watchman told me that that Man was the Captain of the Gang , that he had run away from his Master , and now went a thieving . I was sent for to Justice Philips 's , when the Prisoner and another were brought before him ; I directly said the Prisoner was the Man , but he would not confess any thing then . Joseph Sandford , Surgeon . On the 15th of October , about 11 at Night , the Prosecutor was brought to my House , by two Men . I found a large confused Wound on the back Part of his Head . I stopp 'd the Hemorrhage , and dress 'd his Head . He told me he had been knock 'd down by Street-Robbers , under the Lamp in Well-Close-Square , and that they had taken fifteen pence half-penny from him . John Jones , the Watchman . As I was beating the Round , I heard some Fellows rioting and singing , and thought they were playing the Rogue ; but by and by I heard a hard Stroke , which I thought was against a Post , and going forward I found the Prosecutor lying on the Ground , all bloody , without his Hat or Wig . He begg 'd me to help him up , and carry him to a Surgeon . John Hinds . As I was going over Salt Petre Bank , I saw three Fellows near the Square ; one of 'em is named - Perkins , and another is call 'd Nice Neddy . Standing at my own Door , I heard the Blow , and going up to the Prosecutor , I saw him bloody , and without Hat or Wig . William Carly , Constable . After the Prisoner was committed to Newgate , he confess 'd to me that he and three more were concern 'd in this Robbery , and that himself took the Money . Prisoner . I , and Nice Neddy , and Will Woolcott , and Ned Perkins , were all concern 'd in this Thing . I had a Stick in my Hand ; and so when I had knock 'd him down , we took three pence in Money from him , and then we were forced to run away . Robert Pease . The Prisoner was my 'Prentice . He serv 'd me three Years and a half , and has receiv 'd and paid Money for me very honestly ; and has work 'd ( Cooper 's Work ) among the Merchants , and I never knew him wrong any Body , till lately he has been drawn away by wild Company , and got a Trick of lying out o ' Nights . The Jury found him guilty . Death . John Taylor , of St. Paul 's Covent Garden , was indicted for Petty Treason , in Coining two False and Counterfeit Shillings , made of Lead , Pewter , and other base Metal , in the Likeness of the Lawful Coin of this Realm , call 'd King George the First 's Shilling ; and with an Intent to deceive and defraud one Sovereign Lord the King , and his Subjects , the 6th of November last . Late at Night , on the 5th of November , the Prisoner came drunk to John Hampstead , a Soldier , who sold Gingerbread at the Door of the Pench Bowl and Two Blue Posts , in Russel-Street , Covent Garden , and gave him a bad Shilling to change for a Pennyworth of Gingerbread . Honest Friend , says Hampstead , ( looking on the Money , and bending it between his Teeth ) this is not Good ; and if you had another such a Piece you might be brought into Trouble . The Prisoner took out some more Money to pay for the Gingerbread ; says Hampstead , There 's another Shilling in your Hand that looks like a Bad One too . The Prisoner bade him try it then , which he did , and found it like the former . By this time several People were got together , and the Prisoner was apprehended , and carried before Justice Du Veil . On his Examination , he said he call 'd for a Pint of Beer at the Swan Alehouse in the Old 'Change , and gave the Man Half a Crown , who return 'd him those two Shillings , and four pence half-penny ; and therefore he desired the Justice to grant a Warrant to take up that Victualler . The Justice carried the Prisoner into a private Room , and press 'd him to discover the Truth there , but in vain . He was then brought out again , and at last confess 'd that he made those two , and one more , himself ; and that he had intended to make fix in all ; but not with a Design to defraud any Body , by putting them off for Good Money , but only to make a Fortunatus 's Wishing Cap with 'em , to divert his Fellow-Servants , and his Master 's Child , in an Evening . ( Fortunatus 's Wishing Cap is a Thing that Jugglers show Tricks with . ) The Prisoner call 'd several Witnesses in his Defence . William Hunt . I am a Gold Chain-maker . The Prisoner is my Apprentice . He was an honest , industrious Servant , minded his Business , and behaved himself very well in the Family . I have intrusted him with a great deal of Gold , and never found any Deficiency . I was surpriz 'd at hearing he was taken , and that my House was to be search 'd for Coining Tools . I went to the Justice to enquire about it , and there saw the two Counterfeit Shillings , and immediately perceived that they were not struck , but cast in Sand . I have heard him talk about a Wishing-Cap . John Currier . I am Journeyman to the last Witess , Mr. Hunt . I was present when the Prisoner cast the Shillings , ( for he did not do it privately ) and he said they were to make a Fortunatus 's Wishing Cap . I had heard him talk a long time before about such a thing , and we having a Gold Button to match , he said he 'd take that Opportunity , and cast the Shillings in the same Flask , which he did ; and afterwards took this Tool , which is frequently used in our Trade , and did the Edges of the Shillings . The Flasks are two Iron Frames fill 'd with a particular kind of Sand , in which we make the Impression . John Parrot . I am the Prisoner 's Fellow-Prentice . I saw him cast the two Shillings for making a Wishing Cap . He had talk 'd of it , at times , for above a Year before . Several others depos 'd to the like Purpose , and it appearing a silly boyish Trick , the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . Adam Kenneday and William Roberts , of Pancras , were indicted for stealing a Shirt , a Gown , two Table-cloths , and other Things , the Goods of Edward Tow , in September last . But the Evidence being insufficient , the Jury acquitted them . James Oggars , alias Odgers , of White-Chapel , was indicted for stealing 10 Eggs , and an Earthen Pan , the Goods of Thomas Rogers , the 29th of October last . The Fact being fully proved , the Jury found him guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] George Matthews , of Christ-Church , was indicted for stealing a Cheshire Cheese , value 10 s. the Goods of George Greenwood , the 18th of November last . He was a second time indicted of St. Dunstan 's in the West , for stealing two Hats , value 16 s. the Goods of John Price , the 16th of November last ; which being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found him guilty of both Indictments , to the value of 10 d. each . [ Transportation . See summary . ] Charles Perkins , of St. Sepulchres , [ a little Boy ] was indicted for stealing a Wooden Drawer , value 2 d. a Tea Spoon , value 12 d. fix Ounces of Brass Weights , value 12 d. and 2 s. 6 d. in Money , the Goods and Money of John Gore , the 10th of November last . The Fact being fully proved , the Jury found him Guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] Mordecai Jacob Duvries , a Jew , was indicted for a Misdemeanour , in Forging an Acceptance to a Bill of Exchange , drawn on Peter Victorin of London , Merchant , for 450 l. Sterling , with an intent to Defraud the Governour and Company of the Bank of England , and the said Peter Victorin , and others His Majesty 's Subjects ; and in publishing the said forged Acceptance , knowing it to be counterfeit , with the same fraudulent Design , on the 13th of July 1731 . The Council for the King having opened the Indictment , proceeded to call their Witnesses to prove the Charge . Mr. Carnthers . I am a Servant at the Bank . On the 15th of July last the Prisoner brought several Bills to me to be discounted , to the value of near 1000 l. among which this Bill on Mr. Victorin , for 450 l. was one . [ The Bill was read , and is as follows . ] Stockholm , 30 June , 1731 . 450 l. Sterl . Two Months after Date pay this my first , per Exchange , to Johan Good , or Order , Four Hundred and Fifty Pounds , Sterling . Andries Millern . Accepted 12 July , 1731 . Payable at Messrs. Knight and Jackson . Pet . Victorin . I examin 'd the Acceptance very narrowly , suspected it to be counterfeit , and laid it before the Committee . They order 'd me to take up the Prisoner . He had other Bills in the Hands of other Officers of the Bank , and had been with us several times within two Months , to have Bills discounted , which were all honourably paid . Mr. Knight . I am Banker to Mr. Victorin . I have seen him write often , and do n't believe this Acceptance to be his Hand , for it is not at all like it . I have paid several Bills on him drawn from Stockholm , but remember none drawn by Andries Millern . I never heard that he had such a Correspondent , or even that there was any such Person in being . I have a Bill drawn by Mr. Kireman at Stockholm , on Mr. Victorin , for 200 l. 'T is endors 'd with the Prisoner 's Name , and accepted by Mr. Victorin himself . For the Word Accepted , he writes Accep with a d at top ; for Payable , Pay with le at top ; for Messieurs , Mess with rs at top ; and signs Pet . for Peter . All these Particulars agree with the Acceptance on the Bill before the Court , but the Unlikeness is in the Hand-writing . - Swist . I am Servant to Messrs. Knight and Jackson ; I know Mr. Victorin 's Hand , and that this is not at all like it . Mr. Heater , Ironmonger in Thames-street . I am in Partnership with Mr. Lawrence Victorin , Brother to the Prosecutor , and am well acquainted with Mr. Peter Victorin 's Dealings , and his Hand-writing . I never heard that he had any such Correspondent as Andries Millern . This Bill was brought to our House to know if the Acceptance was Mr. Peter Victorin 's Hand . At first sight , I told the Person it was a Forgery , and not at all like his Hand . Here the Prisoner 's Council urged , That it was very unlikely that a Man should himself go to the Bank with Bills to the value of 1000 l. and among 'em one in which the Hand of a Merchant so well known was forged in so gross and bungling a manner , if he himself had known that it was a Forgery ; and , That as this Bill came from Holland with other good Bills , and some Lottery-Tickets , they wou 'd call a Witness to prove that the Acceptance was wrote in Holland , and the Bill so wrote on inclos 'd with others in a Letter . Then they call 'd the Witnesses in the Prisoner 's Behalf : The first of whom being a Dutch Jow , two Persons , one for the King , and the other for the Prosecutor , were sworn to interpret truly betwixt the Witness and the Court . Isaac Moses . I am Book-keeper to Hardick and Benedictus Jacob Duvries in Amsterdam , who are the Prisoner 's Brothers . This Letter is my Master Benedict 's own Hand . He gave me this accepted Bill with six others not accepted , and 26 Dutch Lottery Tickets to put up in this Letter , which I did , and carry 'd the Letter with all those Bills and Tickets in it , and deliver 'd it so into the Amsterdam Post-Office . The Letter advises of the Bills and Tickets inclos 'd , and that the Bill on Peter Victorin for 450 l. comes ready accepted by him . I saw the Acceptance on the Bill , and the Advice of it in the Letter before I put them in the Post Office . The Advice of the Acceptance is writ in Hebrew , and the Letter is Dated after the Jewish manner , but it answers to Friday , July 20 . 1731 . N. S. Council for the King . Was this other Bill which is drawn by Mr. Kireman at Stockholm on Mr. Victorim for 200 l. put up in that Letter ? Isaac Moses . Yes , I put it in . Council . Is there any Advice of its being accepted ? Isaac Moses . No ; there is not Advice of any of the Bills being accepted , but that one on Mr. Vincent for 450 l. Council . You see it is accepted the 13th of July , 1731 , which is the same Day as the other Bill for 450 l. is accepted on . Isaac Moses . Yes , but it was not accepted when I put it in the Letter ; there was none accepted but the Bill for 450 l. Council . Consider a little . If the 450 l. Bill was accepted on the 13th of July , and that and the 200 l. Bill , which was unaccepted , were inclos 'd both at one time in one Letter , which Letter was writ the 20th of July , and then put in the Amsterdam Post-Office for London ; how could that 200 l. Bill be accepted here on the same Day as the other for 450 l. and 7 Days before the Date of the Letter ? Council for the Prisoner . The Letter was dated the 20th of July , N. S. which is the 9th with us , and it was received here the 13th , as you may see by the Post-Mark upon it . Is there any thing strange in this ? Council for the King . No , but there is in supposing that Mr. Victorin should accept a Bill here on the 13th of July , and that this Bill should be afterwards sent to Holland , and put into the Amsterdam Post-Office on the 9th of July . Council for the Prisoner . We have no need of your Supposition ; we say the Date of the Acceptance is N. S. as well as the Date of the Letter . Council for the King . Then you can prove that Mr. Victorin went over to Holland to accept this Bill . Council for the Prisoner . There is no need of that neither . We allow that the Acceptance is forged , and it might be as well forged in one Style as another : We know not who did it , nor does it concern us , if the Defendant is innocent . Council for the King . When he went to Mr. Victorin , to get the 200 l. Bill accepted , it would have becom 'd his Innocence to have ask 'd that Gentleman , how a Bill of his for 450 l. came to be accepted in Holland . Council for the Prisoner . And so he would without Doubt , if he had had any Suspicion of a Forgery . We shall call one more Witness , 't is Mr. Hindmarsh , who belongs to the Post-Office . Sir , look on that Letter ; do you know it ? Charles Hindmarsh . Yes , here 's the Post-Mark , July 13 , and these Figures , 216 , are of my making , 't is the Charge of Postage ; a single Letter from Holland is 10 d. an Ounce is 314 , when we think they are under an Ounce , we sometimes tax 'em at Discretion ; for we can not be certain of what is in 'em , and we do n't tax Bills of Exchange . If a Letter is over-charg 'd , the Person may have the Surplus returned , if he brings the Letter to the Office . The Council on both Sides agreed it was a Forgery ; but the Point was , whether the Prisoner forg 'd it . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty . [ Fine . See summary . ] [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour . See summary . ] Samuel Cherry , of St. Giles 's without Cripplegate , was indicted for the Murder of Peter Longworth , by giving him , with a drawn Sword , one mortal Wound in the Breast , near the left Pap , of the Length of half an Inch , and the Depth of 2 Inches , on the 17th of August last , of which he languished till the 23d of October following , and then died . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for feloniously slaying the said Samuel Cherry . Lewis Jones . Ant please your Lortship , my Name is Lewis Chones , ant I was upon the Place of Action all the Time , ant I took creat Notices ant Opsersations of esery thing that past ; so as I kis your Lortship ass coot ant petter an Account as any potty .

Ant a Woman sait to the Prisoner , you should not pe so inriged , ant he struck her with his Hant , ant swore , Tam her Plut for a Pitch , what Pusiness wass it of hers ? ant somepotty said , it wass a creat Shame , that a Man that cry't Smallcoal apout the Street for his Pread , shoult pe trusted with a naket Swort , when he cout not keep his Hants off of a Woman .

Ant I look't apout for more Opsersations , ant see two Trums fall town , put it wass not the Teceaset that mettled with 'em ; ant then the Prisoner wass enrach 'd , ant trew his Packenet , ant run ofer the Arms after him ; and I fount there wass Mischief coint forwart , ant so I took creat Notices of efery Thing : Then the Prisoner struck the Teceaset with the flat Site of his Packonet , and sait , stand by ; and then the Teceaset took his Fist a thuss'n , and went to the Prisoner - I think you call it Tarting , for I call it so in my Welch Way ; ant then the Prisoner took his Swort so - and stapt him in the Left-side , ant then the Teceaset aimt a Plow at the Prisoner 's Right-eye , ant sait ass how he woult fight him . No , Sir , says I , you sha n't fight now , for you are a tead Man . The Teceaset was not among the Arms when the Prisoner run after him . John Downs . When the Prisoner was set Centry over the Arms in the Artillery-Ground , another Centry was set opposite to him . The Prisoner went and struck the other Centry for not drawing his Sword . A Woman said , this is some busy medling Man ; with that the Prisoner struck her , and said , D - n ye , stand of . I asked him if he was not asham 'd to strike a Woman ? and then he damn 'd me , and bid me stand off . The Deceased stood at a little Distance , and said , This Man is a hungry , and that makes him so angry ; give him a Piece of Mutton . The Prisoner crossed over the Arms , and said , stand off . The Deceas 'd held up the Mutton , and said , Here , will you have a Bit or no ? and withal made a Motion to fight , but I do n't know that he struck the Prisoner , and then the Prisoner stabb 'd him in the Stomach . John Read . The Arms were grounded near the Muster-Table ; the Prisoner went to the opposite Centry , and struck him on the Arm ( but not in an angry Manner ) and said , Centry , why do n't you draw your Sword ? A Woman said , Smallcoal ; several Boys took the Alarm , and ran about the Prisoner , crying , Smallcoal , Smallcoal . The Prisoner struck some of them , who in Revenge went round , and push 'd down the Drums . The Deceased came up with a Piece of Meat in his Hand , and said , You look as if you was hungry , will you eat a Bit of Mutton ? I did not see the Deceas 'd strike the Prisoner ; but I saw the Prisoner thrust at the Deceas 'd with a Sword . Daniel Woodham , Surgeon . I attended the deceas 'd , and the first Week I thought he was out of Danger . I ask 'd him if he was willing the Prisoner should be bail 'd , and he said , Yes . In three Weeks the Wound appeared to be well ; but he afterwards grew worse than before , and dy 'd on the latter Part of October . On examining the Body , I believe the Wound was the Cause of his Death ; tho ' there was no Sign of it to be perceived before the Body was opened . The Wound entered just below the Breast-Bone , by the Cartilage ensiformis , and went obliquely upwards . I found the Breast full of bloody Matter . I believe there might be 2 Quarts . The left Lobe of the Lungs was wounded ( as it appeared when dilated ) and it had dropp 'd till it was almost lost . The Case was very uncommon . Starkey Middleton . I am of the same Opinion with my Brother . I take the Wound to have been the Cause of the Deceas'd 's Death . The left Part of the Thorax was full of corrupted Matter and Blood ; and the left Lobe of the Lungs was almost entirely wasted . The deceas 'd in his Illness was continually wasting away . As the Wound went upwards , it must rest on the Diaphragma . It was a very uncommon Case . The Prisoner . I was marching for my Master in the Train'd-Bands , and was set Centinel over the Arms . One took up a Firelock : I stepp 'd after him , and made him bring it back , and lay it down again : In the mean time , Others took up other Firelocks , on purpose to teize me ; then they called me Jack in an Office , and some threw Stones and Brick-bats , but I could not distinguish who they were : One tried to kick a Firelock out of its Place ; and a Woman said , if she had the icking of me , she would make me know myself . I bid her keep off ; but did not strike her . The Deceas 'd came forward , and said , I was a Bread and Cheese Soldier , and if I behav 'd myself well , I should have an Egg for Supper . He took a Piece of Meat and smear 'd the Arms , and then kick 'd the Dust on them : I went round the Arms ( not over them ) and told him , if he would not keep back , I would give him a slap , and struck him with the Flat of my Sword , upon which he struck me in the Face several Times , and I stepped back , and held my Sword thus - to keep him off ; and whether the Mob push 'd him , or he came forward of himself , I can not say ; but he run against the Point of my Sword , and received a Wound . Wiggan . As the Prisoner stood Centry , the Deceas 'd went cross the Arms , and rubbed his Meat upon some of them , and said he would take one of the Pieces away ; but I can not tell whether he did take it or no . Ellis . The Deceas 'd , and the rest of the Mob , were affronting the Prisoner , and carrying the Arms from one Place to another ; the Deceas 'd kick 'd the Dust on the Arms , the Prisoner ask 'd , why he did so ? and the other answer 'd , for Fun . The Deceas 'd gave the Prisoner a slap of the Face ; the Prisoner push 'd him off , and then stood still , with his Sword drawn ; and the Deceas 'd advancing again , the Mob push 'd him upon the Prisoner 's Sword . I stood close by . William Saul . The Deceas 'd at first insulted the Prisoner in Coleman-Street ; and One said to him , Prithee , Fellow , go about your Business , or you 'll come nastily off . In the Artillery-Ground , the Mob got about the Prisoner , and the Deceas 'd was playing his Game with him , and moving the Pieces ; the People , with crouding and shoving , threw down the Drums ; the Prisoner then drew his Bayonet , but I bid him turn it on again , which he did , and held his Sword flatways with both Hands ( one at each End ) to keep off the Mob . The Deceas 'd struck the Prisoner in the Face ; the Prisoner retreated , and stood with his Sword in one Hand , but did not push at all . The Mob shov 'd the Deceas 'd upon the Sword . Mr. - There was a Tumult about the Prisoner , who was left Centry while the rest went to refresh themselves . The Deceas 'd took up the Arms . push 'd at the Prisoner , and struck him in the Face ; the Prisoner did not push with his Sword , but the Mob push 'd the Deceas 'd upon it . Peter Culven , Serjeant . I posted the Prisoner , and ordered him to stand Centinel with a drawn Sword . Mr. Jones . The Prisoner is my Servant : I never knew him quarrelsome , or that he would swear , and call a Woman Bitch , as the Welchman has given Evidence . Others gave the Prisoner the Character of a peaceable , sober young Man , and not given to Swearing . The Jury acquitted him . John Miller of St. Bride 's , was indicted for marrying Ann Jones , on the 10th of December , 1730 , his former Wife , Mary Moore , being then living . Ann Hodgkins . On the 11th of March , 1724-5 , in the Evening , the Prisoner and this Woman , Mary Moore , were married at my House in Fleet-Lane , by James Starkey , a Minister that lodg 'd with me 9 Years , but he was not a Prisoner , and all the Ceremony was performed according to the Common Prayer . Mr. Ballantine gave her away , and his Wife was present at the same Time . Ballantine has brought several Weddings to my House . The Prisoner and Mary Moore did not bed at my House ; but they afterwards lived as Man and Wife , and he has been several Times since at my House to drink , but his Wife was not with him . Charles Wheeler . Four or five Years ago , the Prisoner and Mary Moore lodg 'd at my House on Saffron-Hill , for near a Year ; they liv 'd as Man and Wife , and she went by his Name , and he did not contradict it , when he heard her call 'd Mrs. Miller ; but latterly they quarrell 'd . John Matthewson . I have seen them at their Lodgings , at Wheeler 's House , and have heard them both say , in the Presence of each other , that they were married . Prisoner . I will not give the Court the Trouble of proving my second Marriage with Ann Jones , for I own her to be my lawful Wife ; but I shall call some Witnesses to give an Account of this Mary Moore . Ballantine . I never gave away Mary Moore to the Prisoner , nor ever so much as saw them together at Mr. Hodgkins 's House in my Life , nor do I know any thing of their being marry 'd : But any Body may have a Certificate at her House for Half-a-Crown ; and have their Names entered in her Book , for as long Time past as they please . Mrs. Ballantine . I never saw the Prisoner and Mary Moore married at Mrs. Hodgkins 's House , tho ' I lodg 'd there ; nor ever knew of their being married at all . Ann Glover . Mary Moore says , she 'll do my Business for me ; I went with her to prove her Marriage at Mrs. Hodgkins 's , and Mrs. Hodgkins said , for half a Guinea , she 'd enter her Name in the Register ; for a Certificate would not do , if the Marriage was not Registred : Her Name was not in the Book ; and I saw Starkey , the Parson , interline her Name in the Book 5 Years backwards . The Parson is now run away into Scotland ; and Mary Moore begg 'd me not to appear at this Trial . Andrew Montgomery . Mrs. Hodgkins offered me a Marriage-Certificate for a young Woman that happened to be with Child , and was hunted by the Parish-Officers , and she said , for half a Guinea it might be entered backwards in the Book , and would skreen her from the Anger of her Friends . Mrs. Lowry Williams . About three Years ago , Andrew Robinson took a Lodging at my House , and said , he had none but himself and his Wife , and that he was under a Cloud , and should lye there but 2 or 3 Days in a Week ; and this Woman that he said was his Wife , was Mary Moore , and they lived together as Man and Wife for above a Year , and she call 'd him Husband , and he call 'd her Wife . Here he is to prove it . Andrew Robinson . I must needs say 't is all Fact . I had the Misfortune to be acquainted with this base Woman , Mary Moore ( and it has been many a Man 's Misfortune , as well as mine ) and she has given me the foul Disease twice . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and the Court granted him a Copy of his Indictment . was indicted for stealing divers Goods of Ann Drague , Nov. 20 . The Jury found him guilty to the Value of 10 d.

[ Transportation . See summary . ] John Ellis , of St. Margaret 's Westminster , was indicted for assaulting , ravishing , and against her Will , carnally knowing Sarah Matts , on the 4th of March last . Sarah Matts . On the 3d of March , I was sent to the Gate-house for pawning some Bed-Curtains ; I was lock 'd up at 9 that Night , and so I was the second Night ; but about 12 or 1 o ' Clock , the second Night , the Prisoner , and one Sylvester , unbolted the Door ( for it was bolted on the outside ) and came into my Room . The Prisoner came in his Shirt , with a Candle in his Hand . I asked what he wanted ? he bid me get up , and go to the common Side ; and so I got up , and put on my Petticoat , and then he swore , by G - d , he would lye with me ; for he said I was a Street-walker , and might as well lye with him as with every Body else . I told him he should not , for he was my Aversion ; and with that he made no more to do , but knocked me down , 2 or 3 Times , and thump 'd me , and bruised my Breast , and made my Face swell , and then he flung me a-cross the Bed , so as my Head hung down , and he tore my Legs asunder , and lay with me against my Will 3 times . I scream 'd , and cry 'd out , Murder ; but he would lye with me . He did as other Men do , when they lye with Women , and I suppose that needs no explaining . He staid three Hours , and when he went away he lock 'd Sylvester in with me , and Sylvester us 'd me , if possible , worse than the other had done , for he forc 'd me into the Bed , stamp 'd upon my Breast , and made me lye with him all Night . They have since kept two Women out of the way , that they might not appear for me . Prisoner . She came to me afterwards in my Lodge , and taking up a Glass of Wine , ( before the Turnkeys ) said , Here 's to you John , you are no sumbler , for you have lain with me 20 times . Matts . I never said any such Thing . Sarah Taylor . I was sent to the Gatehouse for striking a Woman a blow with a Frying Pan . The Prisoner came up , and ask 'd , how I did , and swore he would lye with me . I told him he should not ; but he swore there was no Woman came there , but he would lye with her , if he pleas 'd ; but by good luck he did me no harm . The 2d Morning that Matts was there , I went up into her Room , and found her crying . Sarah , says I to her , I hope he ha n't - yes , says she , but he has , and beat and bruised me too . And so she told me the whole Story . William Younger . I turn the Key under the Prisoner . I lock 'd up Sarah Matts at 9 , and went to Bed . And about a 11 or 12 , the Prisoner and Sylvester came and took a Candle , and the Keys , and went up the Stairs on the Master-Side , which lead to where the Prosecutor lay . Her Room was in the Gallery ; there 's a Lock to the Gallery Door , but the Doors within the Gallery are only bolted on the out-side . He stay 'd an Hour , or more , and leaving Sylvester behind him , came to Bed to me ; for he us 'd to lye in the Lodge where I lye . I went up to her Room in the Morning , and found Sylvester in Bed , and she with her Clothes on was standing and looking stedfastly at the Window ; but she made no complaint to me . This James Sylvester is a one-ey 'd Fellow , that is not a Prisoner in the Gatehouse ; but only acquainted with the Prisoner at the Bar , who sometimes brings home his Friends when they are shut out of their lodgings , and helps them to a Bed in the Goal . Prisoner . Sarah Matts lent her Clothes to John Sherwin to make his escape out of Newgate , for which I secur 'd her ; and that was the Cause of this Prosecution . For she never spoke a Word of the Rape before this Quarrel about Sherwin . Sarah Matts . After I was turned out of Newgate , I went to see some Women that had been kind to me while I was there ; and this was on the Sunday when Sherwin was going to break out . I saw he follow 'd me down Stairs , but I did not know who he was ; nor could I lend him any Clothes , for I had hardly a Gown to my own Back . John Sherwin . Sarah Matts knew nothing of my going out of Goal in Women 's Clothes . No-body knew of it , but my Wife and Daughter , and Mary Sheton . John Gorget . I lay in the Room over Sarah Matts , in the Gatehouse , and heard a Woman scream out , For the Lord 's Sake be quiet : Let me alone for God 's Sake . This was between 12 and 1 in the Morning . Prisoner . When Gorget was before the Justice , he swore this to be 3 Months after the Time . William Follard . Sarah Matts is a common vile Woman . The greatest Black-guard may lie with her for 6 d. I have seen her in Bed with a Man , in the Guard-Room , at St. James 's . She always had the Character of a Whore and a Thief . George Stacey . I have seen Sarah Matts in Bed with the Prisoner several times since the Rape . Michael Gore . I lay in the next Room to Sarah Matts , and never heard her cry out , and I have seen her in Bed with the Prisoner several times . - Taylor . Gore told me that he heard her cry out . Sarah Matts . And he promis 'd to swear for me , if I would give him Money . Henry Williams . I was committed to the Gatehouse , because my Boy swore Sodomy against me ; which I am as innocent of , as I am of going to Heaven . Now Sarah Matts being there , I wanted a Bit of that same - as any other Man may - and so I invited her to the Sport , and lay with her in March and April too . I 'll assure you I did not ravish her , any otherwise than by talking her over , and making her drink , as a Man must always do in such Cases ; for you know a Woman must be coax 'd a little , though she 's never so willing , - You say right , my Lord , I am a very impudent Fellow , that 's true ; but I ca n't help it - Truth is Truth , and it will come out .
