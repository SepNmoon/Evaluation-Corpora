John Underwood . The Prisoner was my Servant , she came to me very well recommended , but had not staid above ten Weeks before several Things were missing . I examined her about them , and she confessed that she had taken a Silver Girdle Buckle , a Gold Ring , a Shirt , and two Ells of Holland , and had pawned them all at the Greyhound and Three Bowls in Hounsditch , for 18 s. The Goods were found there . She was carried before Alderman Brucas , who committed her to Newgate . I went thither next Day to see her , and then she confessed further , that she had taken from me a Portugal Piece of Gold that goes for 36 s. I was more surprised at this , than at all the rest , because I could not imagine which Way she could come at it . Mrs. Underwood . Missing my Stockings and Aprons , I asked the Prisoner if she knew any thing of them ? She denied that she did ; and as I had received a good Character of her , I did not suspect her Honesty , but thought she might have put them among her own Things by Mistake , and therefore I desired to look in her Box . She readily opened it , and there I found my Aprons , one of my Holland Shifts , and my Prayer-Book . Upon this I began to mistrust her , for I thought she could not take all these Things by Mistake ; and upon taxing her closely , she at last confessed that she had taken the Shift with a Design to carry it away , as she had done several other of my Things which she had pawned ; but she said , the Aprons were put in her Box by Mistake . Prisoner . My Box had no Lock nor Hinges , it always stood open ; I had been Ironing late at Night , and put some of my Mistress 's Things among my own , by Mistake : As for the Ring , I found it among some foul Things , and wanting Money , I carried it to pawn , but did not intend to keep it ; for when my Master paid me my Wages , I fetched it out of pawn with my own Money . Henry Glover . The Prisoner was my Servant above eight Years , she all that Time bore a very good Character ; and I had such an Opinion of her Honesty , that I was in the greatest Surprize when I heard of this Charge against her . The Jury found her Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 2. Robert Bamber , was indicted for privately stealing a Pair of Silver Buckles , value 13 s. in the Shop of Samuel How , April 20 . Samuel How . On the 19th of April the Prisoner came to my Shop and cheapened a Pair of Buckles , but did not buy any , and when he was gone I miss 'd a Pair . He came again next Day to cheapen more . He look 'd over a large Parcel , and desired me to weigh several Pairs , which I did ; but having a Suspicion of him , I watch 'd him narrowly , and at last I saw him put one Pair in his Trowsers . I let him go to the Door , and then stopt him , and charg 'd him with the Theft . He deny 'd it stiffly , but upon my searching him , one Buckle fell from him to the Floor ; upon which he took out the other and gave it me . This was corroborated by William-Charles Hitchen , who was in the Shop at the same Time ; and the Jury found the Prisoner guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 3. Samuel Powers , was indicted for the Murder of Grace , the Wife of John Neal , with a Musquet charg 'd with Gun-powder and Paper , by discharging of which he gave her one mortal Wound in the left Eye , of the Length of one Inch and Depth of one Inch , on the 13th of April ; of which mortal Wound she languished till the 20th Day of the same Month , and then dy 'd . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for Manslaughter John Dodding . I keep a Brandy Shop in Port-Street , by Newport-Market . A Soldier over Night left his Musquet behind a Cask in my Shop . The Prisoner and the Deceased came in next Morning and call 'd for a Quartern of Liquor . He took up the Musquet . I desired him to let it alone . He said it was not charged . I told him that was more than I knew , and again desired him not to meddle with it , and I had hardly spoke before it went off and shot her left Eye out . He and she lived together as Man and Wife , but she was reckon 'd to be the Wife of the Queen 's Coachman , for she went by his Name - Neal . This was done on the Friday Morning , and next Friday she dy 'd . Court . Did he present the Piece towards her ? Dodding . Yes , he held it up and pointed it to her Face , and when he found what he had done , he seem 'd in a Fright , and set it down and went out . Court . Did he threaten to shoot her ? Dodding . No . They came in very friendly , and no Words pass 'd betwixt 'em in Anger ; they only talk 'd of going to their Work . She was a Quilter , and he was a Labouring Man . Isaac Cabele . I was in the Shop at the same Time . The Prisoner went behind the Counter and took up the Piece . The Landlord said , How do you know but it is loaded ? No , says the Prisoner , it is not . How do you know that ! said the Landlord again . Whereof the Prisoner play 'd the Fool with it , and it went off and shot the Woman 's left Eye out of her Head , and then he went away . He did not run , but only walked , and was taken in Long-Acre . She lived about a Week after . Court . Was there any Quarrel between 'em ? Cabele . No . There seem 'd to be no Anger , they came in together and call 'd for a Quartern . - Her Name was Grace Neal formerly , but lately she pass 'd for the Prisoner 's Wife , tho ' indeed she was but a sort of a Lay-by . After she had receiv 'd the Wound , she was sent to the Infirmary in St. James 's , where she dy 'd . Two Surgeons who attended her depos 'd , that that Wound was the Cause of her Death . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that he had no Malice in his Heart , nor thought any Harm , for that he saw no Powder in the Pan , but turning the Piece about to Exercise , it went off suddenly . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 4. Thomas Jones , otherwise Jonas , was indicted for assaulting William Banks , Gent . in an open Place near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 10 s. April 12 . Mr. Banks . About Nine at Night , about a Month ago ( I do n't remember the Time exactly ) I was robb 'd in the Rope-Walk by the Halfway-House at Stepney , by two Men , who took upwards of 10 s. from me . But having never been robb 'd before , I was too much surpriz 'd to take particular Notice of their Persons , so that I can not be positive that the Prisoner was one of them . They likewise took my Hat and three Keys from me , but upon my asking for them again , they return 'd them to me . The Prisoner and Thomas Bunker afterwards offering two Hats to sale in Rosemary-Lane , they were taken upon Suspicion , and then Bunker inform 'd against the Prisoner for being concern 'd with him in this Robbery . Nathaniel Harris . The Prisoner came to my Shop in Rosemary-Lane , and offered to sell me two Hats . Tom Bunker and Tom Welton stood at a little Distance . + Welton is now in Newgate , and Bunker is an Evidence . I had seen them several Times , for a Month or two past , loitering with the Prisoner about Rosemary-Lane . I had some Suspicion on that Account , and what encreas 'd my Suspicion was , that I saw some Blood upon the Hats . So I took the Prisoner over to an Alehouse , and Bunker followed . I ask 'd the Prisoner how he came by the Hats ? He said he had them of Bunker , and Bunker own 'd the Hats to be his own . 'That he bought them in Rag-Fair for 3 s. but when they came before the Justice , Bunker own 'd that they had stole the Hats aboard a Ship , and charged the Prisoner with being concern 'd with him in several Robberies . But we could find none of the Prosecutors but Mr Bank , and he being sent for , he was then positive to the Prisoner , but afterwards he did not seem willing to prosecute . + See the Trial of Welton , & c. below . Mr. Banks . I said , indeed , the Prisoner was a little like one of the Men that robb 'd me , but I could not be so positive as to take my Oath of it . Tho . Bunker . The Prisoner and I went from Betty's-Street ( between Cannon-Street and the new Square in Rateliff Highway ) in order to rob . We met the Prosecutor about 10 at Night . I told him we wanted Money , and bid him deliver . He seem 'd to be surpriz 'd , and order 'd to make Resistance ; upon which the Prisoner draw 'd a Knife , and then he took ten Shillings , a half Crown , a Six-pence , and six Pennyworth of Half-pence from the Prosecutor . We took his Hat too , and three Keys , but gave them to him again . Then he went towards Sun Tavern-Fields , and we went to Bett's-Street , where meeting with * Betty Winship and Jenny Clayton , we went with them to Mr . Petty 's at the Cock and Lion in King-Street , where we had two full Pots of Flip , and the Prisoner and I divided the Money . We had 6 s. 9 d. a-piece . * See the Tryal of Winship , Clayton , & c. below . Mr Banks . I had a half Crown and some Half-pence , besides the ten Shillings , but I saw no Knife drawn . Court . Bunker , how came you acquainted with the Prisoner ? Bunker . Lawrence Youngblood , and Acquaintance of mine , being come from Sea , brought the Prisoner with him to my Grandfather . They took me out with them , and kept me all Night , and so next Night they draw 'd me in to go a robbing with them : The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 5. Bridget Reading , was indicted for stealing a Shirt , the Property of William Johnson , Gent April 20 . She pleaded Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 6. Eliz . Lee , was indicted for stealing a Pair of Sheets and other Things , the Goods of Elizabeth Leveret , April 10 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7. Mary Ramshaw , was indicted for stealing an Earthen Mug tipp 'd with Silver , value 7 s. the Property of George Monk , March 3 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 8. John Jones , of Tottenham-High-Cross , was indicted for assaulting William Vow , Gent . on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 7 s. April 14 . He was a second time indicted for assaulting James Collet , Esq ; on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 5 s. April 14 . Mr . Vow . On the 14th of April as Mr. Collet and I were going in a Chaise to Enfield , we were stopt a little on this Side Tottenham by the Prisoner on Horseback . He produc 'd a Pistol , and demanded our Money . He first robb 'd Mr. Collet , and then took 7 s. from me ; but , not satisfied with our Money , he demanded our Watches . We told him we had none . He said we had , and insisted upon searching us . While we were expostulating with him , a Gentleman 's Servant came riding from Tottenham . The Prisoner turn 'd about , bade him stop , made him dismount , and was going to search him , when Mr. Collet stept out of the Chaise , and with the Handle of his Whip struck the Prisoner on the Side of the Head , and almost knock 'd him down . Mr. Collet . I was going in a Chaise with Mr . Vow to my own House at Enfield , on Saturday Evening , and on this Side Tottenham , just opposite to Mr. Ambrose 's Wall , the Prisoner call 'd to us to stop . I drove the faster ; upon which he rode up , and swore if we did not stop the Horse he 'd shoot him I stopp 'd , he robb 'd me , and afterwards took something from Mr . Vow , and then demanded our Watches . We told him we had none . And presently - Skelton ( Doctor Ward 's Footman ) came towards us from Tottenham . The Prisoner stopp 'd him , and made him dismount , and was going to rob him , when I jump 'd out of the Chaise and struck the Prisoner on the left Side of the Head with the Handle of my Whip . He reel 'd , and riding by the Row of Trees near the School , I saw him fall from his Horse and run to a Ditch , where Skelton jump 'd upon him . - He was not out of my Sight before he fell . - After he was taken I took off his Hat and Wig , and saw the Wound I had given him , and it look 'd fresh . - Skelton . I had been at Edmonton , and was returning , when , just on this Side Tottenham , I perceiv 'd a Chaise standing still and a Man on Horseback by it . I heard him say , Give me your Watches ; and when I came up closer I heard some Money chink in his-Hand . He turn 'd about to me , and said , Damn ye ! deliver this Minute , or you 're a dead Man . He made me dismount that he might search me , and his Back being then to the Chaise , Mr. Collet stept out of the Chaise , and struck him such a Blow with his Whip , that he made him reel , and told me , if I had but given him a second Blow I might have knock 'd him quite down . But I had not that Presence of Mind . The Prisoner rode into Tottenham , I mounted again and follow 'd him . I saw him fall from his Horse into a Ditch hard by the two Rows of Elms . He got up again and ran into another Ditch , and endeavour 'd to get over the Bank into the Field . But in Scrabbling to get up , he slipp 'd down again ; upon which I quitted my Horse , and he offer 'd to shoot , but his Pistol missing Fire , I Jump 'd into the Ditch upon him , and down he went among the Sludge . Prisoner . When this Man came to see for me in Newgate , he charg 'd another Man with the Robbery , and own 'd that he only came for the sake of the Reward . Skelton . No ; but when I came to Newgate I was brought among several Thieves , and Somebody there said , What ! do you come here to swear away a Man 's Life for Hire ? At which being frighted , as fearing some Mischief , I could not suddenly recollect whether the Prisoner was one of those present or not . Philip Cropper . About 8 in the Evening , as I and Sam Brown were sitting at my Master ( Mr. Ambrose 's ) Gate , I heard a Noise at a little Distance . Somebody said , Sir ! what would you have ? we have given you all . And another answer 'd , Your Watches . I ran out to assist , and presently I heard a Blow . I cry 'd out Highwayman ! and a Man on Horseback rode by me , but I could not then see his Face , for he held his Head down thus - . I suppose it was by reason of the Blow that was given him . I follow 'd , and help 'd to take him in the Ditch . Prisoner . Was it Day or Night ? Cropper . It was not dark , I was about a hundred Yards off , and I could see the Chaise and a Man on Horseback . Samuel Brown . Sitting on Mr. Ambrose 's Rails with Cropper , the Gard'ner , I heard a Man say , Stop , or Stand ! Hark ! says I , there 's a Robbery . - Presently a Gentleman said , What would you have more ? you Watch got all . The first made answer , Your Watch , or Watches . Then I heard a large Blow . The Highwayman rode by , and fell into a Ditch , and getting up again ran into another , but in climbing up the Bank to get into the Field , he slipp 'd back , and Skelton push 'd him in and jump 'd upon him John Gibson . Coming from Page-Green I heard a Man ask for Watches ; upon which I stept out of the Fort-way , and saw the Blow given to the Prisoner , while he was searching Skelton . I help 'd Skelton to catch his Horse , and then he rid after the Prisoner , and cross 'd the Common , and endeavour 'd to take the Turning that goes to Justice Harwood 's , but , being upon full Speed , he over-shot himself , and turning back too quick , his Horse 's Foot slipp 'd in the Ditch and threw him . I was then about 60 Yards from him , and am sure he is the Man , for there was no other Horseman upon the Road but he and Skelton for the Space of 10 Minutes . William Netherton . As I was going over the Common I heard a cry of stop Highwayman ; the Prisoner rode by very hard , and would have turn 'd out of the great Road into a bye-way that goes to Justice Harwood 's , but there his Horse threw him into a Ditch , from whence he got out and ran into another Ditch , and we follow 'd . He pull 'd out a Pistol and swore , Damn ye , what wou 'd you have ? The first that stirs any farther is a dead Man . He snapt his Pistol , but it missing fire , Skelton jump 'd upon him in the Ditch . The Jury found him guilty of both Indictments . Death . 9. John Davis was indicted for assaulting John Sadgrove on the Highway , in the Parish of Twickenham , putting him in fear , and taking from him a steel Buckle , value one Penny , and three Shillings in Money , April 30 He was a second time indicted for assaulting Henry Mackrel on the Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Bag value one Penny , and 5 s. 6 d. in Money , April 30 . He was a third time indicted for a Misdemeanor , in assaulting , beating , and wounding Robert Hinton on the Highway , with an Intent to steal his Money and Goods , April 30 . He was a fourth time indicted , for assaulting , beating , and wounding William Ludlow on the Highway , with a Design to rob him . And he was a fifth time indicted for assaulting , beating , and wounding John Fulbrook on the Highway , with an intention to steal his Goods and Money . Robert Hinton . Being out of Business , I went to Colebrook to see for a Place , but not fixing in any , Mr. Mackrel hired me to drive one of his Waggons to London . As we went over Hounslow Heath we had three Waggons in Company ; Mr. Sadgrove drove the first , Mr. Mackrel the second , and I the hindermost : There were other Waggons going the same Road , but some of them were got a pretty Way before us . Between 9 and 10 at Night the Prisoner rode up to me , and ask 'd me if I belong 'd to the Waggon ? I told him I only drove it for Mr. Mackrel . - He then demanded my Money ; I said I had none ; with that he punch 'd me in the Face with his Pistol and broke my Head with it , and turn 'd my Pocket inside out to search , but could find no Money . I got from him once , but he fetch 'd me again and beat me . I got away a second time , and ran to my Master Mackrel , and told him how I had been abus 'd , and so I crept into the Waggon ; I was hardly well in , when the Prisoner came riding up , and said , Damn your Blood , here I am again . Then he robb 'd Mr. Mackrel , and afterwards went to Mr. Sadgrove , who was about as far before Mr. Mackrel as 't is from hence to the Street . I can safely take my Oath that the Prisoner is the very Man that abus 'd me . Henry Mackrel . As we were driving the Waggons over Hounslow-Heath , between 9 and 10 at Night , just as Hinton had told me and William Eastman how he had been abused , a Man came galloping up to us with Pistol in Hand , and said , Damn ye , here I am again , and what then ? - I left him and Eastman disputing together and went round my Horses . The Highwayman rid after me till he came so close , that one of his Horse 's Feet stood upon one of mine ; I ask 'd him what he meant by serving me so ? He demanded my Money ; I gave him my Bag , which had in it two half Crowns , a Shilling , and some Halfpence . He did not meddle with my Waggon , but when he had got my Money he rode from me to Mr. Sadgrove , whose Waggon was about four Lugg * off . - I ca n't swear the Prisoner is the Man that robb 'd me : I had no Lanthorn , and it was not light enough to see his Face , and besides I find I was mistaken as to the Colour of his Horse , for I thought he rode upon a black Horse , but others that were assaulted by the same Man , say it was a dark bay Horse . So that all I can be positive of is this , I was robb 'd by the Man who said , Here I am again . Early next Morning when I came to Kensington I found the Prisoner was taken up there , and I said then and afterwards before Justice Lilly , as I said now , I was robb 'd , but could not swear to the Man . * A Pole or Perch . Court . Hinton , are you positive that Mackrel was robb 'd by the same Man that abus 'd you ? Hinton . Yes , for there was no Body else went by on Horseback from the time he beat me , to the time he robb 'd my Master : Afterwards indeed , a Man rid by on a grey Horse . John Sadgrove Between 9 and 10 at Night on the 30th of April , as I was coming over Hounslow-Heath with my Waggon , I heard somebody galloping hard after me ; I turn 'd my Head and perceiv 'd a Man upon a little serubbed Horse just behind me . Whose Waggon is this ? says he . Why , says I , whose Waggon do you want ? Damn ye , says he , let it be whose it will , if you do n't stop it immediately , I 'll shoot you thro ' the Head : So I stopt my Horses , and then says he , What Passengers have ye got ? Why what do you want with my Passengers ? says I , Why I want their Money , says he , and damn ye I 'll blow your Brains out , if you do n't tumble 'em out of the Waggon-Tumble out my Passengers that I get my daily Bread by ? that would be fine Work indeed ! thought I to myself , so I told him I had no Passengers . Damn ye you lie , says he , - But however , give me your Money and your Bag and all . So I gave him my Bag with 3 s. in it . Now turn your Pockets , says he . I did so , but yet that did not satisfy him . For , says he , you have not so good a Hand at searching as I have ; so he stopp 'd down and search 'd my Fob and my other Pockets himself , but he found only a steel Buckle , which he took away . He again enquir 'd if had any Passengers ? No , says I . You lie , you have , says he . Why then , says I , if you wo n't believe me , you may get off and look . And upon that he gave me a knock with his Whip , and knock 'd me quite under my Horses ; if they had gone forward I should have been crush 'd to Pieces . Then he rode off , but he came back again presently , and giving me a cut with his Whip , told me , that if he should ever come to know that I had any Passengers that Night , I should never travel that Road again . Then he ask 'd me where about the other Waggons were , I said I did not know . He told me I ly 'd ; and taking a Pistol out of his Pocket , he presented it towards me , and said , I have a mighty Mind to give you a Pill before I go . But he went off towards London without doing me any more Mischief . He had not been gone long before I heard a Pistol go off , upon which I concluded that he had overtaken the other Waggons . This was on the Monday Night ; I got into London on Tuesday Morning , and returning thro ' Kensington on Wednesday Morning I went to see the Prisoner , who was in Kensington Round-house . I told him I thought he was the Man that robb 'd me : He desir 'd me to do him Justice ; Aye , says I , then I must hang ye ; and so I went on upon my Journey and the Prisoner was sent to Newgate . Court . How far was you from Mackrel 's Waggon when you was robb 'd ? Sadgrove . His Waggon was 3 or 4 Lugg behind me ; and he told me , that the same Man that robb 'd me , had robb 'd him and abus 'd his Man but a little before . Mackrel . Yes , the Highwayman went directly from me to Sadgrove ; I heard the Blow that he gave him , and was afraid he would have murder 'd him . William Ladlow . My Master Fullbrock and I were upon the Road to London ; he drove the Waggon and I the Cart ; I forgot the Day and Hour , only I remember it was on a Monday Night , and the same Night that Mackrel and Sadgrove were robb 'd , tho ' neither I nor my Master saw any thing of those Robberies , for we were a Mile or better before Sadgrove : But as we were coming out of Hounslow , the Prisoner rode up to my Master , and shook Hands with him , and said , Honest Countryman ! How go Affair , in our Country ? There was a Light in a Room pretty near us ; I suppose somebody was going to Bed , and by this Light I could see the Prisoner plainly : He parted from us , and we drove forward along Smallberry Green : By and by I heard a Horse coming hard behind me , I gave the Way ; the Prisoner came up and cry 'd , Damn your Blood , where 's your Passengers ? I want their Money ! Grand look , says I , and ask 'em for it . Upon that he beat me , and going up to the Head of the Waggon he tore the Tilt to look in ; I struck at his Horse with my Whip , and his Horse moving a little , he pull 'd a Pistol out of his Bosom and fired at me ; the Bullet just graz 'd on my Cheek ; he did not stay to examine the Waggon after he had shot , but rode towards London . We hollo 'd out to the Turnpike Men to stop him , but they let him pass ; tho ' when we came up they own 'd they heard us hollo , but pretended that they did not know what we hollo 'd for . John Fullbrook . Coming out of Hounslow the Prisoner rode up and shook Hands with me , and ask 'd me what House ! should drink at on Smallberry Green ? I told him , that was according as the People happened to be up , and so we parted for the present ; but we had not got above a quarter of a Mile upon Smallberry-Green before he follow 'd and stopp 'd the Waggon . I had some Passengers , who had 4 or 5 l. among them , which they hid in the Straw , and I had Money myself . But the Prisoner neither search 'd me not them , for he shot at my Man and then rode off towards London . We came to Kensington about 2 , ( Or something more ) in the Morning . It was Just begun to be a little lightish , and there we saw the Prisoner , who was just taken by Clark the Watchman and others Both I and my Son know him again as soon as we saw him . He was in the same Dress as when he stopp 'd my Waggon , for then he had no Boots , a light Coat , and a white Horse-hair Wig , and he rode a little bay Horse about 14 or 15 Hands high . Robert Clark , Watchman in Kensington . On Tuesday Morning , between 1 and 2 , I heard a Horse trampling and prancing at a Brandy Shop Door in Kensington . I went up to see who was there , and found the Prisoner sitting on a little bay Horse , and drinking Gin with a Soldier . The Newbury Coach had been robb 'd but the Saturday before , and a Man then rid by me full Speed on such a Horse as I now found the Prisoner 's to be . This gave me the first Suspicion that he was one of those concern 'd in that Robbery , and made me take the more Notice of him . He ask 'd me what a Clock it was ? I told him it wanted a quarter of Two . He pull 'd out a Watch , and took the Case off to look at it . I thought by the Manner of his handling it , that he had not been much us 'd to a Watch . As he put up the Watch I perceiv 'd a Pistol in his Breast , and this made me conclude that he was one of the Highwaymen that robb 'd the Newbury Coach , for I had not then heard of the Waggons being robb 'd . So I resolv 'd to get Help if I could and take him . But that he might not mistrust me I staid a little to drink with him , and then told him I was going to call up some Market People , tho ' , God knows my Heart , I was going for Assistance to apprehend him . I went to a Tallow Chandler 's and a Baker 's , and told their Men , who were at work , that there was a Highwayman at the Brandy Shop Door , and if they would assist me , we might easily take him . I hey seem 'd then afraid to venture , and so I went back ; but in a little while I found two of them ( Paget and White ) at the Gin-shop . We drank two or three Quarterns , and then I was for taking the Prisoner , tho ' they were still afraid , but I swore , - yes , I did swear , begging your Lordship 's Pardon , - that now was the only Time , and so I seiz 'd him , took the Pistol out of his Breast , and clapp 'd it to him . He struggled and endeavoured to get his Hand to his left Pocket , and if he had done that , Gods knows , I might have been kill 'd , for he had got a Pistol there , but others assisting me , we prevented farther Mischief . We had scarce well secur 'd him before the Waggons came up . The Waggoners were overjoy 'd to see him ; and as poor People are apt to swear an Oath now and then as well as their Betters , they all swore that he was the Man that had robb 'd and abus 'd them . Court . Was Mackrel there then ? Clark . Yes , and Sadgrove too , and they both swore positively and heartily that he was the Man . - As soon as ever they saw him , they cry 'd , This is the Rogue that robb 'd us ! But they were afterwards afraid to swear positively before the Justice , for as they constantly travell 'd the Road , they thought their Lives would be always in Danger . The Prisoner was searched , and a Pistol ready charg 'd and 8 loose Balls and some Powder and other Things , were taken out of his Pockets . The Pistol that I took from him was not charg 'd . I suppose that was the Pistol he had discharg 'd at one of the Waggoners : For one of them ( a little Fellow ) came in with his Face bloody , and said the Prisoner had shot at him , and that the Ball graz 'd upon his Cheek . - So we carried the Prisoner to the Round-house 'till such Time as his Magistrate the Justice was up . - Have I told a Word of a Lie now ? [ To the Prisoner . ] Prisoner . Yes , in saying that you saw me ride by you in Kensington on the Saturday before , for I was sick a-bed then . Court . How was the Prisoner dress 'd ? Clark . He had a white Horse-hair Wig , a light Coat , black Waistcoat and Breeches , and no Boots ; I ask 'd him why he rid without Boots , and he said he had worn 'em out . William Paget . Clark the Watchman knock 'd at my Master 's Door about 2 a-Clock on May-day Morning , and ask 'd me to go and take a Highwayman at the Brandy Shop . He said he had call 'd upon Will . White too , but Will . was then lock 'd in , and could not get out immediately . Clark went away and I call 'd upon White , and took him with me to the Gin-shop Presently we heard Clark crying 2 a-Clock , and White call 'd him in . - When we had drank together , says Clark , I 'll go and seize him now , or he 'll be gone . So he went to the outside of the Prisoner 's Horse , clapp 'd his Hand to the Prisoner 's Coat , took a Pistol out of the Prisoner 's Bosom , and holding it up , threaten 'd to shoot him . - The Prisoner lean 'd back , and went to put his left Hand to his Pocket , but I prevented him , and holding him by the Coat he fell back , and his Heels struck thro ' the Brandy Man 's Window . Two or three Shillings and a Six-Pence fell out of his Pocket . I kneel 'd upon him to keep him down , and took a Pistol out of his Pocket . the Constable came , and then we ty 'd the Prisoner 's Hands and search 'd him farther , and we found upon him two Handkerchiefs , a Snuff-Box , a Silver Watch , and a Pewter Watch ( such as they have to please Children , ) seven or eight loose Bullets , a little Powder in a Bag , a Fleam , a Silver Buckle , and a Steel Shoe-Buckle . In a quarter of an Hour three or four Waggoners came in , and swore he was the Man that robb 'd 'em . The Soldier that was drinking with the Prisoner , said the Prisoner was a Gentleman , and went to push me from him , but upon my holding the Pistol to the Soldier , he march 'd off . Court . Shew that Shoe-Buckle to Sadgrove . Sidgrove . This is the Buckle the Prisoner took from me , and here is the Fellow to it . William White . Paget call 'd me from Work to help the Watchman . I went up , and looking at the Prisoner I saw no Pistol , and so was forgoing away ; but the Watchman coming in , said , he was sure that the Prisoner had a Pistol . The Man of the House said , Have a Care what you do , fo r he 's a Gentleman . - The Watchman seiz 'd him , took a discharg 'd Pistol from his Breast , and Paget took a loaded one from his Pocket . We pull 'd him back , and in falling he broke the Window with his Feet , and dropp 'd some Money . The Waggoners came in , and swore Damn him , this is the Man that robb 'd us , - and this is his Horse . It was a dark bay Horse , about 14 Hands high . The Prisoner had no Boots , and but one Spur . Tho Sympson , Constable . When I came up to the Prisoner , White and Paget had just pull 'd him off his Horse , and there was a Soldier , who , I believe , had a great Mind to rescue him . The Waggoners came in and said , This is the Rogue that robb 'd us on Hounslow-Health and Smallberry-Green . Do you say that I am the Man ? says the Prisoner . Yes , and will swear it too , said they . I ask 'd him why he had abus 'd the Waggoners ? He said he had neither been upon Hounslow Health nor near it , not any farther on that Road than Kensington , where he then was . But upon searching him , we found , besides other Things , two Turnpike Tickets for that Day , one for Smallberry-Green , and another for Kensington . And when he saw them , he said he did not know where he had been . I ask 'd him what Business he had with those Pistols and Bullets , and he told me he was a Gunsmith by Trade . The Money that we found about him was 13 s 6 d. in Silver , and 2 d. 3 Farthings . The first Day that he was carry 'd before the Justice he would confess nothing ; but the second time , when he found he must go to Newgate , he own 'd he had committed several Robberies on t'other Side of the Water , but still said , that he neither robb 'd the Waggoners , nor . knew any thing of them . Prisoner . I do n't know that I ever saw any of the Witnesses that have sworn against me , 't ll I saw them at Kensington . Court . Then you did not take Fullbrook by the Hand at Hounslow ? Prisoner . No , I saw none of them . I shall give an Account how I get my Bread . - I do n't deny but I have been guilty of some Facts , but not of these that I am indicted for . Court . What Facts ? Prisoner . That will be known when the Gentlemen that I shall call come in and give their Evidence . William Ansell . I am an Anchor Smith . I live in St. Mary Magdalen Bermondsey . I have known the Prisoner five Years . He served his Time to a Farrier , but he work 'd along with me at my Business six Months . Then he went three Years and a half Armourer in the Cadugan , an India Man . When he came back , which is two Years ago , or better , he return 'd to his Work , and work 'd in a very barbarous Manner . Court . Barbarous ! Ansell Yes , he work 'd till his Hands were so sore that he could hold it no longer . Court . How long did he hold it ? Ansell . He work 'd at our Shop three Weeks ( after he came from India ) and then he went down to see his Father in Wales . He staid about a Fortnight , and then return 'd to his Work , and continu 'd at it constantly till within these six or seven Weeks ; and he work 'd very hard , and call him when you would he was always ready . I have call 'd him up to Work by One or Two in the Morning ( as our Business sometimes requir 'd it ) and he was always ready and willing . I was almost continually in his Company . I never saw him disguis 'd in Liquer ; he was not at all given to drink or game , or keep ill Company , but was always very sober and sedate . We work 'd at Harrison 's and Duke 's , Anchor-Smiths in Rotherbith . Thomas Perriers . I am Clerk to those Anchor-Works . The Prisoner kept his Time as well as any Man in the Work , and behav 'd in a very regular precise Way . But our Labour being very hard , and he being in a weak Condition , he went to India to gather Strength . - The last of his working with us was from June to the 7th of March last , and then he took Leave of the Shop , and said he was going down to his Father in Pembrokeshire , he not having Strength to hold the Business . Richard Henderson . He behav 'd very handsomely , kept his Time well , was very diligent in his Business , and never guilty of Drinking , Swearing , or keeping ill Company . He left the Work about six Weeks ago , but I can say nothing of him since that Time . He told us he was going to see his Father and Mother . Court . But it seems he did not go . [ Several other Witnesses spoke to the same Purpose . ] Prisoner . I own I did not go down to Wales . But there was a young Man , one Richard Cass , a vile Rogue , that came over with me from India , and he telling me a great many fine Stories about going upon the Highway , and I not knowing any better , was led into it . Court . Was not Cass taken on your Information ? John Bourn . I am the Prisoner 's Brother-in-Law . On his Information I took up Cass about a Month ago at the White Horse behind the 'Change , and then Cass would have sworn against my own Brother and me too , but Justice Lade would not take his Oath . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty . Death . 10 Henry Hart , was indicted for assaulting ( with William Morland and Robert Smith , not yet taken ) Eliz . Kelly in a Field near the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Blanket , value 1 s. 10 d. April 5 . Eliz . Kelly . On Thursday the 5th of April , about half an Hour past 8 at Night , as I was going down the Steps into Middle-Moorfields with a Blanket that I had just bought in Grub-Street , I met four young Fellows coming up . I went on , and they turn 'd back and follow 'd me . The Prisoner took hold of the Blanket , and said , What have you got here ? 'T is nothing but a Blanket , says I ; and with that he gave me a Blow with his Fist , and knock 'd me down . I held the Blanket still , and begg 'd him not to abuse me , because I was big with Child . Then let go the Blanket , says he . I was loth to lose it , and struggled to keep it as long as I could ; upon which he kick 'd me , and at last pull 'd it from me , and then he ran one Way , and the others who stood by , ran another Way . I cry 'd out , Stop Thief , and follow 'd the Prisoner , and he was taken within about 30 Yards , by a Man who was coming towards me . I heard him ask the Man why he stopp 'd him ? and the Man said , because the Woman cry 'd out . Prisoner . As for the Blanket , you had it under your Arm when I was taken . E. K. No , Somebody pick 'd it up , and brought it to the Man that took the Prisoner ; but they would not let me have it , except I would go before the Justice , Thomas Smith . As I was walking over Moorfields , between 8 and 9 at Night , I heard the Cry of Murder ! Thieves ! It was a little darkish , and running towards the Noise , I met the Prisoner coming full Speed from the Woman . She was then about 30 Yards off . I stopp 'd him . He cry 'd , What do you want ? What do you want ? I told him , I beliv 'd he was the Person concern 'd . She soon came up , and said , he had dragg 'd her along the Ground by a Blanket , and taken it from her . He had nothing when I took him , but Somebody presently brought in the Blanket , and she said it was hers . The Prisoner deny 'd that he knew any thing of the Matter , and said that he was not the first Man that had been wrongfully accus 'd . We carry 'd him to the Flying Horse by the Watch-house , and sent for a Constable , and next Day he was carry 'd before Justice Chamberlain in Spittle-Yard . Prisoner . Had I any Stick ? Smith . No . Prisoner . I had been playing the Fool in throwing Stones , and hearing a Woman cry , I was afraid I had done some Mischief , and that made me run . William Bagley . The Prisoner and I , and Will Morland and Bob Smith , went out upon Street-Robberies . We pass 'd the Woman in Moorfields . Says the Prisoner , I wonder what she has got ? Why , says I , nothing but a Blanket . She 's big with Child , says he , and I fancy she may have Child-bed Linnen . So we follow 'd her , and he went foremost , gave her a Knock with his Fist , and tripp 'd her up , and said , Damn you , deliver the Blanket . She struggled to keep it , and held one End while he dragg 'd her along by the other , and at last he got it from her , and ran away . He had no Stick . We stood by to watch . He was taken at one End of the Field , and I at the other , and we were both carry 'd to the same House , the Flying Horse ; and going next Day before Justice Chamberlain , I confess 'd , and made my Information . Prisoner . In what Robberies have I ever been concern 'd with you ? Bagley . Why , do n't you remember , that at the Corner of Queen-Street in Drury-Lane , you took a Hat ? Prisoner . You took one , indeed , but I was not with you , for I had miss 'd you above half an Hour , and wonder 'd what was become of you . Bagley . You know we sold the Hat in Rag-Fair for 20 d. and shar 'd the Money . Prisoner . Well , and what other Robberies have I been in with you ? - How long have we been acquainted ? Bagley . Why , last Easter-Monday we got drunk together , and that was the first of our Acquaintance . Prisoner . When I was taken there were several got about me , and I insisted on being charged by a Constable , because I knew my self innocent ; but they quarrell 'd about who should have the Reward . Thomas Eden . I put the Prisoner out Apprentice to a Vintner , 8 or 9 Years ago , here are his two Masters . - He serv 'd his Time in our Neighbourhood , and had a very honest Character then . But I know nothing of him since he has been gone out of the Neighbourhood , which is about 9 Months . James Pilloniere . He serv 'd me 3 Years , I trusted him considerably , and never found that he wrong 'd me . He went from me about a Year to Mr. Mendall at the Queen's-Head in Pater-noster Row . Mr. Mendall being oblig 'd to be out of Town , could not attend here . - The Prisoner has been gone from him about 5 or 6 Months . Edmund Peacock . He liv 'd with me two Years ; I turn 'd him over to Mr. Pilloniere ; I trusted him in the Bar to take Money , and believe he was very honest : I have heard Mr. Mendall give him a good Character . Thomas Brown . I have trusted him in my House with Plate : He behav 'd so well , that I would have lent him a Guinea or two on his bare Word ; I knew him only when he liv 'd with Mr. Pilloniere . Philip Roberts . The Prisoner not getting Employment in the Vintners Business , he did labouring Work at the Water-side till within these 6 Weeks . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 11.

Acquitted . 19. Thomas Adley , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of John Lear , in the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , and stealing 31 Brussels Lac 'd Head-dresses , value 120 l. one Point-lace Cravat value 40 s. one Point-lace Pair of Ruffles value 20 s. 13 Ounces of Silver-lace value 3 l. three Yards of Velvet value 45 s. three Yards of Silk , 18 Pair of Bugle Tassels for Manteels , one striped sattin Gown , and several other Things , on the 10th of September last in the Night . John Lear . I deal in Apparel , mercery Linnen and Lace ; my Shop is in High Holborn , near Drury-Lane . It was broke open on the 10th of September in the Night I lost 31 Suits of lac 'd Headcloths , they were taken out of the 31 small Boxes that stood by the Window , but the Boxes were left behind ; 7 Ounces of narrow open silver Lace , 12 Yards of broad silver Lace , and 5 Yards of narrow silver Lace , 3 Yards of black Velvet cut out for a Scarfe , and a red silk Lining for it ; 18 Pair of Manteel Tassels , a sattin Gown , a Shift , an Apron , a Point-lace Neckcloth and Ruffles ; 17 back Heads with Lace , 14 Suits of Nightclothes , and other Things . On the 25th of April , this back Head - 't is new Brussels Lace , and cost me 20 Guineas - was brought to my Shop to be sold by Eliz . Eager : I presently knew it to be one of those that I had lost , and therefore enquir 'd how she came by it : She said she had it from Mrs. Broadhurst in Monmonth-street . Upon farther Enquiry , I found that Mrs. Broadhurst had it from Mrs. Slurrow in Westminster ; Mrs. Slurrow from Mrs. Sanders , and she from the Prisoner . I obtain 'd a search Warrant from my Lord Mayor , and went with Mrs. Sanders and others to the Prisoner 's House in Pye-Corner . In the Table Drawer below Stairs I found this Pair of minteel red Tassels with white Bugles ; I can safely swear to 'em , for I know 'em from a thousand ; I had 'em made on Purpose to suit the Fancy of a particular Lady . My Wife and Brother , and the Constable , went up Stairs with the Prisoner , and brought down with them these 12 pair of black manteel Tassels , which I verily believe are part of those I lost . Then the Prisoner himself put his Hand behind some Pewter on a Shelf , and took out these two Brussels Lace Suits , and gave them to my Brother . We ask 'd the Prisoner how he came by these Goods ; he said he bought a Handkercherful of these and other things of a Woman in Rag-Fair . - At first he said for 3 Guineas , but afterward for 3 l. 8 s. And he said he believ 'd he cou 'd find the Person out if he might have his Liberty to look for her . We did not care to trust him alone , but went with him ; he carried us into a House where a large Company of Men were sitting round a Table : He call 'd to one of them , and said , Hark ye , Are not you the Man I bought the Lace of ? - I the Man ! says the other , No ; I know nothing of it . Why then I am mistaken , says the Prisoner . By his asking a Man this Question when he had told us but a little before that he had them from a Woman , we found he was only shuffling with us , and so we carried him before a Magistrate , and then he said he had all the Things from Mrs. Sanders . Court . What Business did the Prisoner follow ? Lear . I suppose he dealt in old Cloaths , for I saw some lying upon the Floor , but he kept no publick Shop . Mrs. Lear . On the 10th of December , between 10 and 11 at Night , we left the Shop all fast and went to Bed , and between 5 and 6 in the morning we were call 'd up , and round we had been robb 'd ; several Holes had been bored in the Pannel of the outer Window Shutter , and then the Pannel was slit down and so taken out : A Piece of Woollen of the Colour of the Shutters was nail 'd over the Hole and daub 'd with Clay . Thro ' this Hole they had push 'd back the inner Shutters , and so taken the Goods off of two Shelves next the Window . without getting quite into the House . Behind the Counter lay the 31 empty Boxes and a Parcel of Cloaths that had been push 'd down . - This Head I took out of the Prisoner 's Pocket . - I 'll tell ye the whole Tale presently . - I can swear to all these Goods , and to this red and white Tasse particularly . Juryman . I think you said it was in December that your Shop was broke open . Mrs. Lear . December , did I say ? - Then I mistook . - It was in September . - On the 25th of April , Betty Eager came to our Shop with this Head to sell . - We ask 'd her where she had it ? Why , of Mrs. Broadhurst : We sent for Mrs. Broadhurst , she came , and told us she had it of Mrs. Slurrow . We went to Mrs. Slurrow , and she carried us to Mrs. Sanders , who keeps a Chandler 's Shop and takes in Pawns . Pray , Mrs. Sanders , says I , How did you come by this lac 'd Head ? Why , says she , Tom Adley desir 'd me to sell it for him . And where does he live ? says I . Why says she , he has often told me that he liv 'd in Peter's-Street ; but I sent my Maid one Day to watch him , and so I found that he liv 'd in Pye Corner . So we got a Warrant and went thither , and ask 'd him if he had given that Head to Mrs. Sanders . He deny 'd it at first , but afterwards own 'd it . Have you got any more such in the House ? says I ; no , says He ; I had indeed more of this old fashion 'd Lace , but I have sold it all . And where did you get it ? says I . Why , says he , I bought it of a Gentlewoman in Rag-fair , over against the dead Wall ; I had a Handkercherful of it for three Guineas . Three Guineas ? says I . No , says he , now I remember , it was 3 l. 8 s. We found this pair of red Tassels in a Drawer below , and then my Brother and I and the Constable went up and found 12 pair of bugle Tassels . There was a Coat hanging up ; I ask 'd the Prisoner if it was his , and he said , Yes . I search 'd the Pockets and took out this lac 'd Head . Now , says I , this is plain Proof against you , and therefore you may as well confess . Why then , says he , there 's more below . So he went down with us , and took these two Heads from behind some Pewter , and gave them to my Brother . And now , says he , if you 'll let me have my Liberty , I 'll find the Woman I bought 'em of . And so you 'll run away , says I . No , says he , I 'll give my Bond that I wo n't . Your Bond ? says I , that would be a fine Security indeed ! No , we 'll call a Coach and go together . And so away we went , and he carried us to a House where there was a Parcel of Thieves sitting round a Table , and he beckon 'd to one of them , and said , Young Man , did not you sell me a Parcel of Lace ? No not I , says the Man . We found bu this , there was nothing in the Prisoner 's Pretence , and thought that by leading us about , he only wanted an Opportunity to get away ; and so we carried him before a Justice , and when he came there he offer 'd to make himself an Evidence , and said that he had all the Things from Mrs. Sanders . Says the Justice 's Clerk , This Man was try 'd not long ago for stealing a Horse . Alice Sanders . I keep a Chandler 's Shop in Great St. Anne's-Lane , Westminster ; my Husband is a House-Painter . The Prisoner has known me from a Child , for my Father was a Serjeant in the Guards , and the Prisoner was then a Soldier : And so he came to see me about 3 or 4 Weeks before last Christmas . He brought a blue Bag with him , but there was nothing in it then , and he only ask 'd me how I did , and the like , and so went away again . But the next time he came , he brought 9 Ells of Linnen in the Bag to sell . He ask 'd 13 d. a Yard ; I bid him 11 d. and at last we agreed for 9 s. 6 d for the whole . He came again a Week after with the same blue Bag , and ask 'd me if I knew any Body that would buy a Suit of lac 'd Headclothes . I told him I did not want myself , but I would enquire among my Acquaintance He said the Price was 18 s. and so he left 'em with me , and I afterwards sold 'em to Eliz . Grindley , a very honest Woman . She was acquainted with Houses of Fashion , and knew where to dispose of such Things , and I had no Suspicion of the Prisoner , for I knew he dealt in old Clothes , and always took him for a very honest Man . On the Friday before the 25th of April he came and told me his two Daughters were going to be pass 'd to another Parish , and then he shew 'd me this lac 'd Head , which he said he bought of the Duchess of Richmond 's Gentlewoman , and he desir 'd me to dispose of it for him . He bid me ask eight Guineas . I carry 'd it to Mrs. Slurrow 's ( while he staid in my Shop ) and she bid me six Guineas . I came back to tell him , and he bid me take the Money . I went again , but she had not the Money ready , and so I laid down four Guineas and a half , which my Maid paid him before two Witnesses , and he was to call next Day for the rest of the Money ; he accordingly came , but she had not paid me ; he came again next Tuesday , but the Money was not ready then neither ; so that he never had it , for the Affair was discover 'd presently after . Mrs. Slurrow brought Mrs. Lear to me , and said , she would have the Head if she could be sure that it was honestly come by . To satisfy them , I went with them to the Prisoner 's House . He was not at home , but we staid till he came in . How do you do , Mr. Adley ? says I . This Gentlewoman would buy the Head you left with me to dispose of , but she 's scrupulous about its being honestly come by . Who are you ? says he , I do n't know you , I never saw you in my Life before . I was surpris 'd at this , but when they told him they had got a Search-warrant , he own 'd that he gave me a Head , but he said he did not know it again . However , at last he confess 'd , that that was the very Head he had left with me . This other lac 'd Head I had got Betty Grindley to felt . Mrs. Lear went with me to Grindley 's to enquire after it , and she had sold it to Mrs. Dell , a Gentlewoman of the Town , in Westminster . Mrs. Dell had pawn 'd it to Robert Ward , and at his House we found it . Mrs. Lear . Hear 's another lac 'd Head that was unwash 'd when I lost it . A. Sanders . This I had unwash 'd from the Prisoner , and deliver 'd it so to Mrs. Grindley . She sold it so to Mrs. Martin , who sold it again to a 'Squire , and the 'Squire made a Present of it to Mrs. Murray , another Woman of the Town in Bedford-Street , in Covent-Garden . Mrs. Lear . And I found it upon Madam Murray , but neither she not the 'Squire are willing to appear here . - These lac 'd Ends of a Neckcloth were my Lord London-derry 's . A. Sanders . And these I had from the Prisoner , I deliver 'd them to Grindley , and she dispos 'd of them to Sarah Fowler , at a Lace-shop in Duke-Street , but Mrs. Fowler is sick , and can not come hither . Mrs. Lear . This is my Velvet . There was three Yards of it . I found it at Mrs. Sander 's House . A. Sanders . I bought this Velvet of the Prisoner for 26 s. 6 d. I reckon there was but two Yards and three Quarters . I bought this Sattin Gown of him too , for I produc 'd it to Mrs. Lear , tho ' she knew nothing of my having it . Prisoner . What did I allow you for selling these Things , as you say ? A. Sanders . Nothing . Prisoner . That must be hard indeed . A. Sanders . You spent your Money at my House for what you wanted . You did not say at first that you had them from a Man , but from a Gentlewoman , and that you gave 'em me to dispose of . Mr. Lear . Mrs. Sanders told me at first , that she had 'em from Adley , who liv 'd in Pye-Corner ; she said , he had told her he liv 'd in Peter's-Street . She shew 'd me the Sattin Gown and the Velvet freely , and I knew nothing of her having the Gown before she produc 'd it ; and she told me , that Grindley was gone over the Water with two Suits to sell . Eliz . Grindley . I had this lac 'd Suit from Mrs. Sanders , and I sold it to Mrs . Waters at the Golden-Ball in York-Buildings . Mrs. Sanders , indeed , told me at first , that this lac 'd Suit came from a Woman of her Acquaintance , who was kept by a Gentleman . But about six Weeks ago the Prisoner being in Mrs. Sander 's House , he told me , that she had the lac 'd Heads from him . Court . How came he to say that to you ? Grindley . Why , I being a Laundress , have sometimes an Opportunity of selling such kind of Things , and I had sold several for Mrs. Sanders . Now , you must know , that now and then I happen to get a little merry , as any other Body may do , and then I say any thing that comes uppermost ; so coming into Mrs. Sanders 's House in one of these merry Fits , there was she and the Prisoner , a sitting by the Fire ; and says Mrs Sanders to me , This is the old Man that I have had all the lac 'd Heads from . Ay , says I , and pray , old Gentleman , how do you come by such Things ? Why , I 'll tell you , says he , my Daughter lives with a Woman that is kept by a Jew in the Minories , and this Jew gives his Mistress these Things for Pocket Money , and she sends them to me by my Daughter to sell for her , and so I bring them to Mrs. Sanders . And so Mrs. Sanders gave 'em to me to dispose of 'em as well as I could ; and this Head I sold to Madam Dell , a Town Lady , for three Guineas , and this to Mrs. Martin , who keeps Martin 's Coffee-house at Charing-Cross . I was bid to ask six Guineas for it . Mrs. Clapham , at the Golden-Anchor , bid me two Guineas ; I try 'd at some other Shops , and at last I let Mrs. Martin have it for three Guineas and a half . I sold her another Head afterwards . Mrs. Lear . And that , Mrs. Martin sold again to a Jew ; but we can not yet produce it . Mrs. Martin . I bought two Heads of Mrs. Grindley , one of them I sold * to Mr. Bray , a young Gentleman , who said he bought it for a Present . - This is very like it . * For Twelve Guineas . Mrs. Lear . Like it ? Why , is it not the very same ? Did not he make a Present of it to Mrs. Murray ? and did not I find it upon Mrs. Murray ? Prisoner to Grindley . Did you never say that you sold those two Heads at a Brandy Shop ? now you swear you sold 'em at a Coffee-house . Grindley . What if I did ? Mrs. Martin keeps a Coffee-house over a Brandy-shop . Mrs. Martin . I let the lower Floor of my House for 25 l. a Year , to Mr. Capstick , a Distiller . Mrs. Grindley , it seems , brought this Head to Mrs. Capstick , who shew 'd it to me , and ask 'd my Advice about it , whether it would make a Suit of Head-clothes for her . It was cut and mangled , and very dirty . I told her there would be many Joinings in it , and therefore I thought it was fitter for a Back-head than a Suit [ for a Suit has four Lappets , and a Back-head but two . ] Then she said she would not buy it , and ask 'd me if I thought I could dispose of it for an Acquaintance of hers . What is she ? says I . A very honest Woman , says Mrs. Capstick ; I know her very well , her Husband runs Goods . This Woman ( which was Mrs. Grindley ) came in , and I ask 'd her whose Head it was ? and she said it belong 'd to a Cap woman who had it from her Cull . How came it to be cut so ? says I . Why , says she again , she 's a very maggotly Creature , and she cut it when she was drunk . I bid Money for it then , but she refus 'd it and went away . She came three or four times afterwards , and at last I bought it , and some Time after , I bought another of her ; she came at several other Times with other Heads , but I did not buy any more than those two . Anne Wildon . I lodge in Mrs. Sanders 's House . I was sitting in her Shop about Christmas last , when the Prisoner came in with a Bag under his Arm . He pull 'd a Band-box out of his Bag and unty 'd it , and shew 'd Mrs. Sanders a Parcel of Tassels , and said to her , I have got these Tassels to sell , do you know any Body that will buy them ? No , says she , except this young Woman , ( meaning me ) for she has liv 'd with an Old-Clothes Woman , and may know how to dispose of them . Then he told me he 'd give me 6 d. to sell 'em for him . I took them from him , and he bid me ask 2 s. a Pair for the large , and 18 d. for the small ones . These are the same , I can swear . Mrs. Lear . And these mourning Tassels I found in the Prisoner 's Drawer . A Wilden . I went to the Gentlewoman 's House , where I had been a Servant , and she said they were a perfect Drug , and that she would not give 2 s. for 'em all . I have seen the Prisoner several times at Mrs. Sander 's House , and have seen her give him Money , both Gold and Silver . I have known her from a Child ; she 's as honest a Woman as ever liv 'd , and her Husband bears a very good Character . Prisoner . These were Sander 's Tassels ; she took 'em in for a Pawn , and I had them originally from her ; she desir 'd me to sell them , and when I found I could not , I return 'd them to her . Mary Cutton , Sanders 's Maid . The Prisoner came into my Mistress 's Shop , and sat down in the great Chair and pull 'd out some Head-clothes , and ask 'd her if she could not be so good as to sell them for him . My Mistress would have had me to have gone , but he desir 'd her to go herself ; for he said it was a lac 'd Suit that he had from the Duchess of Richmond 's , and would have her ask eight Guineas for it . I have seen my Mistress pay him Money several times , and once she gave me in the Yard four Guineas and a half for him , and I carry 'd it in and paid it to him . William Parr . Alice Sanders is my Daughter . I have known the Prisoner 23 Years ; I was his Serjeant 10 Years . He uses to deal in several Things new and old , and hawk Goods about the Street . One Day , when I was at my Daughter 's , he came into the Entry , and deliver 'd a Suit of lac 'd Head-clothes to some Woman there , but I ca n't say who she was , for I did not take much Notice . James Desan . When the Prisoner was in Newgate he sent a Letter to me to come to him , and I went . - Says he , If Mrs. Sanders do n't come down with the Crop , I 'll make a blue Day of it , for I had all the Goods from her . Can you have the Face , says I , to say that you did not deliver them to her ? Why not , says he , when she has us 'd me so barbarously as to bring a Constable to search my House ? But what would you have a poor Woman do , says I , when the Goods were brought to her , and found upon her ? Do ? says he , why , she might have sent for me , and I would have vouch 'd that I saw her take 'em in Pawn , and that would have clear 'd her and me too . From him I went to Mrs Sanders , and told her what he said . She answer 'd , that she was innocent , and would not part with a Farthing . I acquainted him with her Answer , and he then sent me to her Husband to see if he would not lay down half the Crop . I went , but her Husband would not do any thing . I return 'd to the Prisoner , and told him of it ; And , says I , when she found that the Goods were stolen , she might think you might have them from some Thieves , and could have discover 'd who they were . Ay , says he , and so I might have made a Noose for my own Neck . - Mrs. Sanders bears a good Character . Robert Ward . I took this Head in pawn from Mrs. Carman , who was Servant to Mrs. Dell , a Woman of the Town . - Mrs. Lear , could not swear to it when she found it at my House . Prisoner . When the Search-warrant came to my House , Mrs. Sanders took me aside , and said , For God 's sake do n't say that you had the Things from me . But I told her , then I must tell a Lye to deny it , and my Conscience would not let me do that . Mrs. Lear . He was at first so far from pretending that he had them from her , that he said he did not know her . Prisoner . I had them all from her , and what I could not sell I always return 'd , and the lac 'd Heads were of so high a Price that I could never sell them . Court . Prove what you say . Prisoner . 'T is in Hardship that I want Witnesses to prove it , and she took Care I should have none ; for when she had any Thing to deliver to me , she us 'd to send her Maid up Stairs to make the Beds ; but I can prove that she ask 'd the Gentlewoman what she should swear . George Mason . I went to see the Prisoner in Wood-street Compter , and as he was going before Justice Brocas , Mrs. Sanders came up to me in a very great Surprize and Flutter , and said , Lord , Sir , what shall I do ? What Course shall I take ? What can you advise me to ? What shall I say ? What shall I swear ? Court . Was you acquainted with her ? Mason . No , I never saw her in my Life before . Court . 'T is very odd that a Woman should express herself in such a manner , to a Man who was an intire Stranger to her . - What are you , Sir ? Mason . I keep a Chandler 's Shop and a Brandy-shop in Aldersgate-street . - I have known the Prisoner a Year , and sometimes we have drank together , and I never saw but he behav 'd himself well . James Desan . This Man was in the Compter with the Prisoner , and advis 'd him to be an Evidence ; and he , ( as well as the Prisoner ) said , If Sanders wo n't come down , by God , he was pleas 'd to take God 's Name in vain , we 'll make a blue Day of it . Ann Adley . While Mr. Lear and his Wife and the Constable were searching my Father 's House , Mrs. Sanders whisper 'd to me , and said , For God 's sake do n't own that your Father had any thing to sell for me . Court . Would you rather save Sanders than your Father ? A . A . No , to be sure , I would rather save my Father ? Court . Then , when your Father was in so much Danger , why did you , at the Request of Mrs. Sanders , conceal a Thing that might have done him Service ? A . A. I did speak of it . Court . When ? A . A . Three Days after . C. And why not sooner ? A . A. I was in a Fright , and did not know what to do . - I have seen my Father bring home lac 'd Heads , and he told me that he had 'em from Mrs. Sanders to sell for her . C. That wo n't do . Did you ever see her deliver any to him ? A . A . No . C. Then what he told von signifies nothing . John Howell . I have known the Prisoner 25 Years . He had a very honest Character , and I never saw an ill Word come out of his Mouth . Isaac Herbert . I am Beadle of St . Faith 's under St. Paul 's . I have known him near 40 Years ; he used to buy and sell Houshold Goods ; I took him for an honest Man . Dorothy Coleman , at the Red-Lion by Hicks's-Hall .

My Girl came up with the Beer , and I presently went down . When he had drank his Pint he was going out very orderly ; but I stopp 'd him at the Door , and told him it was not kindly done of him to carry off my Punch Bowl . What do you mean ? says he , I am the King 's Officer , I have had an Information that you keep run China in your House ; and I have Authority to search and take it where I find it . - Here 's my Deputation . I ask 'd him if he had a Deputation to go a Thieving , and not finding that he had , I carried him before a Justice , and the Justice committed him to Newgate . Prisoner . I belong to the King , and to prove it , I have got my Deputation ready to produce . - Here it is . Then the Deputation was read . 'T is dated Octo . 24 , 1728 . It impowers the Bearer , having a Constable and a Writ of Assistance , to enter Houses in the Day-time , and seize Goods prohibited , or for which the Custom has not been paid . Prisoner .

Had you any Constable or Writ of Assistance ? Prisoner . No , I ca n't say that I had . Court . Who gave you the Informations ? Prisoner . I must beg your Pardon there , Sir , we that are the King 's Officers must never discover Informe rs . Edward Walter . I am the Prisoner 's superior Officer , I have known him four Years , and never heard that he had a bad Character . Court .
