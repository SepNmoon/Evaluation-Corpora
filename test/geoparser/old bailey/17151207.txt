This Trial was very long , but the Substance of the Evidence on each side may be reduc 'd to this : That for the King was as follows : Mr. Smith swore , he lost the Goods above-mention 'd ; That the Prisoner , who had liv 'd with him a Year and a half , as his Housekeeper , persuaded him to go to Chiswick , to see his Grand Children , and for the Advantage of his Health ; as accordingly he did ; where the Prisoner was to come to him : But she failing of her Promise , he grew uneasie , and came to Town , found his Doors fast and his House empty ; and upon breaking it open , the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment gone . Immediately he goes in Exchange-Alley , and puts up his Lottery Tickets ; by which Means he discover 'd the Prisoners , who sold them there . Upon this he made it his Business to find them out ; and being inform 'd Kelly was at Hull , in the Post of a Lieutenant in that Garrison , he employ 'd a Person with a Warrant to apprehend him ; which was done with great Caution and Respect , the Prisoner Mower being taken before at the same Place , where she kept Kelly Company . One Beatknife depos 'd , he search 'd the Prisoner 's Room , and in a Hair Trunk found a great part of the Goods ; most of which were sworn to by the Prosecutor and his Daughter to be theirs , in Court . It was prov 'd by several Witnesses , that the Prisoner Kelly manag 'd the selling of the Tickets , and that Mower gave the Receipts ; And that he went to the Three Cups in Aldersgate-street , to bespeak a place in the Lincoln Coach for himself , designing for Hull , which was however fill 'd up by the Prisoner Mower ; That they lay together at the said Inn , and were there taken for Man and Wife ; That the Goods were carried down by the said Coach in Kelly 's Portmanteau , and that he himself went down with her on Horseback . The Prisoner Mower said in her Defence , That Mr. Smith had made a Bargain with her in his Wife 's Life-time , to come and live with him , if his Wife should die , and be his Bedfellow : That after his Wife was dead , he claim 'd her Promise , and She went to live with him , and be put her into Possession of all he had : That she was with Child by him ; upon which he order 'd her to take a Room on t'other side the Water , and gave the Lottery Tickets for her Security : After this her Husband came to London from Berbadoes ; and having been inform 'd of her late Course of Life , she was forc 'd to dispose of the Tickets to appease him . To prove all this , she call 'd several Witnesses , who depos 'd , Mr. Smith was acquainted with her in his Wife 's Life-time , and made her civil Visits ; that once he came to the House where Mower lodg 'd in Mourning , and claim 'd her Promise to live with him , and took her away ; That after this , she appear 'd very fine , and the Evidence being surpriz 'd at the Alteration , Mower said , Mr. Smith gave them her as a Reward for her Services . It was also depos 'd by one , That Mr. Smith Seem 'd very loth to Prosecute Mrs. Mower , and would not have done it , if Mr. Kelly would have given him a Bond not to prosecute him for false imprisonment ; and that he was very tender of her while in Newgate . There were others who depos 'd , they heard Mr. Smith say in Newgate , he was very well satisfy 'd as to her being with Child . Some there were also who spoke well of Mr. Mower 's Reputation . The Prisoner Kelly depos 'd , That Mr. Mower ( the Prisoner 's Husband ) sent for him about two Months ago , and enquir 'd for his Wife ; and that he inform 'd him how she liv 'd : That after this he went to Mrs. Mower , and inform 'd her of her Husband 's Arrival ; which seem 'd to disturb her , because of her familiarity with Mr. Smith . But after this , Mr. Mower and his Wife sent for him to a Tavern , and desir 'd him to dispose of some Lottery Tickets for him ; which accordingly he did , not doubting but they were his own : That after this , they all met again ; and Mr. Mower told him , he had married another Wife in Berbadoes ; but was now resolv 'd to live with his Wife Jane , in Holland , where he had some Effects ; and desir 'd him to see his Wife safe at Hull , as soon as possible , and take care of her Embarkment there for that Voyage ; for he having a Kinsman of his other Wife 's in Town , who had some small Business to do with him in Holland , he durst not carry her with him lest he should be disoblig 'd . To confirm all this , he produced a Letter ; which he said was sent to his House in Town ( where this Prisoner had a Wife and Family ) from Mr. Mower in Holland , desiring him to dispatch the Business of his last Request ; for that now all Things were ready for his Wife 's Reception . He also called several Witnesses to prove the Circumstances of his Defence , and to speak to his Reputation ; who did him but little Service : And two Evidences call 'd by the Prosecutor , gave them both the work of Characters . The Jury considering the Matter , found them both Guilty of the Indictments . [ Mower : Death -respited for pregnancy . See summary . ] [ Kelley : Branding .

A Gentleman extremely afflicted with the Gout , by taking 10 Drops of this Volatile Spirit in 2 Glass of Spring-Water , Morning , Noon and Night , was wonderfully eased of his Pains and Lameness .
