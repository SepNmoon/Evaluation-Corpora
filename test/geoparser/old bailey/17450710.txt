Samuel Quincey I am a shoemaker . On the 26th of February I went out , locked my shop up , and put the key of the door in my pocket ; I returned about ten at night , and found the sash had been shoved up , and all the shoes in the shop were gone as in the indictment , and a quarter of a yard of silver lace . I do not keep a sale shop , they were only for shew . James Bye . The Prisoner lodged in the same house as I did , one Lucas 's , who was condemned last sessions , and executed . On Shrove Tuesday she and I went into Leather Lane between nine and ten at night ; we came to a shoemaker 's shop , and I said , Sall , I believe here it is : there was a man coming along , and she said let us wait for him : we staid a little while till the man was gone by , then I lifted up the sash , put my arm in , and took out a pair of mens shoes which had been newly heel pieced , then I took down two pair of womens stuff damask shoes , I could not reach any more that way , so I got my whole body in , and took down three pair more , and gave them all to the Prisoner ; ( we frequented one Hawkins 's in Golden Lane who harbours nothing but thieves : ) then we went to the house where we lodged , and there came one Tom Williams , a sort of a printer , who kept company with her . I asked her whether she designed to dispose of the shoes that night ; she said , no , and went out with that Williams , and staid out all night with him : the next day one Mary Baily went with her to dispose of the womens shoes , for which they brought nine shillings , and I had half the money - I can not tell whether they sold them or pawned them . The Prosecutor and the Accomplice agreed as to the colour of the shoes . Some of Mr. Quincey 's shoes , which had been pawned , were produced , and Mr. Boomer , the Constable , said the pawnbroker told him they were pawned by Mary Baily , and that he knew nothing of the Prisoner ; and by the ticket they appeared to be pawned the 27th of February . There being no other positive evidence , but that of the accomplice , to affect the Prisoner , she was acquited . 301. Jane Scott , of St. Paul , Shadwell , was indicted for stealing 10 moidores , the property of John Woodroffe , July 6 . John Woodroffe . Last Saturday about noon I lost 10 moidores out of my chest on board the ship Ann from Boston in New-England - it was in a purse in a pocket of a pair of breeches . Q . Was the chest locked ? Woodroffe . It was locked , but the key was in it . I was called out of the steerage and returned again in about 5 minutes , and when I came to look for it , it was gone . The Prisoner and one Mrs. Butcher came to see me , I desired them to stay dinner , and presently after dinner they went away . Q . How did you come to find it out ? Woodroffe . By Mrs. Butcher . When I went out of the steerage , I left them both sitting upon my chest , and when I came back they were sitting there , and she said what made you leave the key in your chest ? and she took it out and gave it me . I had no mistrust of her then , but I found it out by a rash word of Mrs. Butcher 's , that she wished the devil had had her before she went on board with the Prisoner ; that expression gave me a mistrust of the Prisoner . Q . How came she to come on board o'ship , did you know her before ? Woodroffe . I had seen her several times , for I was acquainted with her husband . Q . Had not you been several times at her house in Coleman street ? Woodroffe . I have been there . Elizabeth Butcher . The Prisoner asked me to go with her on board o'ship to see her uncle ; she said , this old gentleman [ Woodroffe ] was her uncle ; when she came on board she called for John Woodroffe , and the Prosecutor came , he unlocked his chest to give us a dram , and was called up upon deck ; while he was gone , she said , my old uncle has taken a French prize , and I 'll see if he has got any linen in his chest ; I said , for shame , do n't look into your uncle 's chest when he is not in the way . When the old gentleman was coming down again , she shut down the lid of the chest . Q . Did she take any thing out of the chest ? Butcher . Her hand was in the chest , but her back being towards me , I did not see her take anything out . She said , uncle , why do you leave the key in your chest ? and then she locked the chest , and he put the key in his pocket . Q . What made you mistrust her taking the money ? Butcher . Because she paid her creditors in moidores that afternoon , and she had but one half peny in her pocket when she went on board - I did not see her pay any . Stephen Seager . [ a baker ] Last Saturday bout 3 o'clock in the afternoon [ 6th of July ] the Prisoner brought a moidore to change , and paid me s. she owed me . Vincent Clinton [ a baker . ] Much about that time she brought a moidore to me , and paid me 5 s. she owed me . W. Ward [ a distiller . ] The Prisoner owed me 8 s. 8 d. and on Saturday between 2 and 3 in the afternoon she brought a moidore , and paid me . Elizabeth Mulliner [ a pawnbroker . ] The Prisoner owed me 22 s. upon goods she had pledged , and last Saturday she came about 3 or 4 o'clock , and paid me with a moidore . Woodroffe . We dined on board about one o'clock , and they went away directly after dinner . Q . Have you ever lain at the Prisoner 's house ? Woodroffe . I have once or twice when I have been late in town - I lay there the Sunday before she robbed me . Q . What made you mistrust the Prisoner ? Woodroffe . Because Mrs. Butcher came on board that afternoon , and acquainted me with her having some moidores ; then I looked for mine , and they were gone . Q . Did not you give her the money upon the account of an injury that her daughter had received from you ? Woodroffe . No , I never gave her a moidore , I lent her a guinea some time ago to pay the King 's tax . Prisoner . He was in bed with me . He had like to have undone my child , and he fell down upon his knees , and asked my pardon , and gave me seven moidores to hold my tongue and not to expose him , and he said he would be a friend to me , and keep my child all her life . Ann Boyd . I am the Prisoner 's sister ; I live in New Gravel Lane . Q . Has not the Prosecutor been at your sister 's house 3 or 4 days together ? Boyd . Will you please to hear me , and I will tell you the truth . I saw Mr. Woodroffe in bed with my sister , and he gave her seven moidores ; I have swore to it - it is now about 8 days ago - I can not tell what day of the week it was - it was one day about a week ago - my sister sent for me . Q . What did your sister send for you for ? Boyd . To ask me if she owed me any money , and I said she did for lodging . I shall speak what I am ashamed to speak * . He came to her to smother the injury he had done to the child ; a child about 7 years of age ; and I saw my sister and him in bed together , and he gave her 7 moidores . * She deposed that the child had been very much injured in her private parts . Q . What conversation passed between them ? Boyd . He said he loved her very dearly . Q. I ask you what they said that is material to the present matter ? Boyd . I do not know what they did , but they were in bed together . Q . You was speaking of moidores , what did you see about them ? Boyd . I saw the money given out of his hand into hers . Q . Where had he money , or what was it in ? Boyd . He had it in a purse , he took it out of his pocket and gave it to her . Q . What did he give it her for ? Boyd . He said he gave it her [ here she paused a considerable time ] I ca n't say what he gave it her for ; but my sister 's child was used in a very base manner . He gave me half a guinea to hold my tongue , but I would not , for my sister 's child was used in a base manner ; but I am no base woman . Q . In what manner was the child used ? Boyd . I ca n't explain it if I was to lose my life - my dear sister 's child was in a bleeding capacity in the private parts . Q . Did he say he had done any thing to the child ? Boyd . No , he denied it , but we found him with the child in the garret , and no body else could do it ; and my sister was in liquor , poor thing . Q . What passed about this ? Boyd . Lord bless me , I ca n't tell , we were all in a passion and threatened to prosecute him , and so he has brought this indictment against my sister . David Boyd . Mr. Woodroffe gave my wife half a guinea , I did not know what it was for then ; I thought it was because she was a whore to him , and I beat her for it ; she would have given it to me , and I would not have it . My sister told me he had given her 7 moidores to make it up about the child . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 302.

There was a hole cut in the kitchen window shutter , and the bolt unbolted , and a hole cut through the door , and the plate mentioned in the indictment was taken away . A sew days after Mr. White stopped the Prisoner with the snuff pan , which I knew by the coat of arms - the candlesticks are worth about nine guineas , and the tea pot about 14 or 15 pounds . Mary Slaney . When I came down in the morning , I found a hole cut in the kitchen window shutter , and in the door , and these things were gone . Fuller White . I live in Noble street . On Thursday the 30th of May , the Prisoner came to my shop , and asked me if I would buy some old broken silver , I said , yes ; he asked what I would give him an ounce , I said , I could not tell till I saw it . Then he took a piece of silver [ the snuff pan ] I asked him if it was his own , he said , yes ; I shewed it my partner , for it was doubled up in a very strange manner . I asked him again if it was his , then he said it was his friend 's . My partner and I did not like it ; and I told him I would stop the silver and him too . As soon as I had spoke the words he opened the door , and run down Noble street ( I cried out stop thief , and alarmed the neighbourhood , and pursued him ) then he turned down Oat lane , and into Staining lane , and my partner caught hold of him at the end of Lillipot lane , and brought him back , and then he said he had a partner , and that he run out to call him . In the hurly burly , Mr. Hague came over , told him he was a rogue , and accused him with stealing them , and fetched over a tea pot he had bought of the Prisoner . There was an advertisement published by this lady with a reward , upon which we acquainted her with it , and she came and owned them by the coat of arms . I had opened the snuffer pan , and then the coat of arms appeared . John Fray . [ Mr. White 's partner ] On the 30th of May the person at the bar came to Mr. White 's house , and asked him if he would buy any old silver ; he asked him what he had to sell , and he pulled out part of a snuffer pan rolled up together ; he first said it was his own , and then that it was a friend 's of his . I said , Mr. White , let me look at it , and said , I fancy it is stole , stop him and the silver too ; Mr. White said he would , and then he opened the door and run away , and we took him in Lillipot lane . I asked him what he was , he said , he was a dealer in silver , and travelled the country . I asked him how old sterling went now , he said , he did not know the worth of it . I asked him how new sterling went , and he said he could not tell . I asked him what he gave an ounce for it , he said he did not know but he might give about 4 s. 3 d. Then he said he bought it by the lump , as they do butter . Said I , I fancy you stole it ; he said , he bought it in the country , then he said he bought a parcel of silver in Mary le Bone fields , and gave four pounds , odd money for it . When Mrs. Leprimandy came to see it , I put it into the vice and opened it , and it had her arms upon it . John Hague . On the 29th of May , the Prisoner at the bar came into my shop , and asked if I bought old silver , I told him , yes ; I asked him what he he had got to sell , he put his hand into his pocket , and brought out a lump of silver lace burnt , about an ounce and a half , and I gave him 5 s. 6 d. an ounce . He had a lump of melted silver , and asked what I would give an ounce for it ; I said I could not tell till I had made an essay . He left it with me to have the essay made , and that took off all suspicion of its being stole , and I bought it of him ; there were 11 ounces and odd peny weights . I bought a tea pot of him , which was bent together , but as he said he travelled the country , I did not suspect it to be stolen on that account , for people do that to old silver , either for lightness of carriage or ease in packing , and I gave him 5 s. 4 d. an ounce for it . I saw him go into Mr. White 's , and I desired a neighbour to go in after him , and if he was selling any plate to desire Mr. White to stop him , and presently there was a hue and cry . After he was taken , I went into Mr. White 's , and said to the Prisoner , you are a villain , and I verily believe the plate is stolen ; and he said he bought it of a man at Mary le Bone . I carried the tea-pot over to Mr. White 's , and got one of the warnings from Goldsmith 's Hall . I was three quarters of an hour in getting the pot open , for fear of spoiling the coat of arms , to see whether it agreed with the advertisement , and it did . I asked him if there was any body concerned with him in it , and if there was I desired him to make himself an evidence : he said there was nobody concerned but himself , and he could impeach nobody . George Shute . I live with Deputy Bailey in Forster Lane . The Prisoner brought some silver unburnt , and desired me to burn it ; and while I was burning it , he asked me whether he could not melt silver in a kitchen grate ; I told him the best way was to build a forge . He pulled out a piece of a pair of snuffers out of his pocket , and I bought that of him at 4 s. 6 d. an ounce : there was no mark or coat of arms upon it ; that and the burnt silver came to 13 s. 6 d. Prisoner . I met a man at Mary le Bone , and he asked me whether I would buy any old plate , for he thought by my bag that I dealt in plate , and was going to meet a bargain ; I said I did not care to buy it , because I did not know him , nor how he came by it ; he said he had taken a French prize , and it was part of what he had for his share of it , and I gave him 4 l. 7 s. for the whole ; for I told him French plate was not so good as English , and after I had bought it , I would have had my money again , but he would not give it me . Sarah Stokes . About the latter end of May , on a Saturday in the afternoon , I met the Prisoner in Portland Street , and he desired me to go and drink a part of a tankard of beer , and there was a sailor along with him , and the sailor pulled some silver out of his pocket : there was a silver tea pot , a silver snuffer pan , and some silver in a lump ; the silver was tied up in an old handkerchief : the Prisoner asked him how he came by it ; he said he found it on board a French ship they had taken , and put it into his trowzers , and he gave him four guineas in gold and three shillings in silver for it - the tea-pot was rolled up , but I could discern that it was a tea-pot . Weldon Bride . I am the Prisoner 's brother . On the 20th of May last the Prisoner at the bar lay in my apartment at the house of John Hume , a shoemaker , in Duke 's Court . He came in about nine o'clock at night as they were shutting up shop , and went out about seven o'clock the next morning : he could not go out without my knowing it , because he lay in the same room , and in the same bed . The Rev . Mr. Atkinson . I have known the Prisoner sixteen or seventeen years ; he lived with a near relation of mine in Ireland , and after he went out of his service he let him a farm , and afterwards he went into Colonel Frasier 's service , and I never heard but he bore a very good character . Elizabeth Bride [ wife of Weldon Bride . ] The Prisoner came in the 20th of May about nine o'clock at night , laid with my husband , and went out between six and seven the next day . Mr. Frasier [ Nephew to Colonel Frasier . ] The Prisoner lived with my father and grandfather , and my uncle , he has been entrusted with a great deal of money and goods of value , and money bills : Col. Frasier has entrusted him with a note of 50 l. to receive : he was very well recommended , and the Colonel did not discharge him for any dishonesty . Guilty of feloniously stealing the goods , acquitted of stealing them in the dwelling-house . [ Transportation .

Hannah Herring . On the third of June between nine and ten o'clock in the evening I was going with my aunt Howard towards Hampstead , and the Prisoner stopped my aunt between Pancras and the Turnpike , and she begged of him to let her alone , for she was big with child , and he gave her some ill language , and then he tore my apron off my sides , and d - d me , and carried the apron away with him ; then I cried out murder and thieves , and some people came to my assistance . Prisoner . There were two or three other men , and they would salute the women , and I went to salute the young woman , and took hold of her apron , and pulled it off , but I did not carry it away . Hannah Herring . The three men were going towards London , they went before the Prisoner , and upon my crying out thieves they came back , and asking me what I had lost , I said my apron , and they brought the Prisoner back with my apron , and carried him into the Adam and Eve in Pancras Church Yard : they searched him to see if he had any pistol , but he had none , he had only a common walking stick . He fell down on his knees , and asked pardon . Elizabeth Howard . We were going towards Pancras Church , and three men met us and saluted us , and walked on , then the Prisoner came up and called me an imposturous B - h - I suppose it was , because I told him I was with child , and desired he would not meddle with me ; then he laid hold of Hannah Herring , and she cried out , and the three men took him , and brought him back . Q . How long was it after he took the apron before they brought him back ? Howard . It was about a quarter of an hour . Prisoner . When I came up to her , I said , are not you a preposterous creature ? and I went to kiss them , but I did not take the apron . [ John Proctor . The Constable produced Herring 's apron ] Q. to Herring . Did he carry the apron away , or did he drop it upon the ground ? Herring . He said D - n you , and then took my apron , and run away with it . John Barton . I have known the Prisoner about fifteen years , he has been a dealer in hair , and I am a perriwig maker , he was at my shop about two years ago , he has the character of an honest man . Mr. Samuel Rossell [ Curate of St. Giles 's Cripplegate . ] I have known the Prisoner about five year last past , but my knowledge of him is only from his being a constant attender at church for five years : he has been a communicant once a month , and he received the sacrament the day before he was charged with this fact . I am very much surprized at it , and can hardly think he can be guilty of it . Thomas Shad . I have known him between two and three years , and have trusted him with small sums of four , five , or six shillings , and he has paid me . I take him to be a very honest man , and as the Gentleman says , I have seen him at church many a time . Acquitted . 313. William Joseph Dix , otherwise Joseph William Dix , of Alhallows Lombard Street , was indicted for stealing ten dozen of fowls , value 8 l. 17 s. the goods of John Johnson , June 3 . John Johnson . I am a poulterer in St. James 's Market . On the third day of June I went to Leadenhal Market , and bought ten dozen of fowls and chickens dead , which came to 8 l. 17 s. 9 d. After I had packed them up , I called out porter , and this Dix stood close by me with a new knot , a rope , and a ticket : I did not know him , so I looked on his ticket , and there was upon the ticket , Matthew Turner at Fetter Lane , freeman . I was told he was a ticket porter , and that I was very safe , so I ordered him to carry the fowls to my house : this was about a quarter after six , I went home about a quarter after seven , and there were no fowls come , and I had none all that day . Mr. Basset saw two men at Deptford with some fowls , and having heard of my losing some fowls , secured the Prisoner , and sent to me . I went to Deptford , tied the Prisoner 's arms , paid the reckoning , and came away , and paid ten shillings for a landau to bring him to London . Adam Sharrock . I am a porter and carman , and work for Mr. Johnson ; he bought ten dozen and seven fowls and chickens : I was going with some goods for another master , and he said he could not stay till I came back : the Prisoner stood by him with a knot , and he asked me if I knew the man ; I said I knew nothing of him ; I looked upon his ticket , and there was upon it Matthew Turner , Fetter Lane ; I said , master , you are very safe , he is a ticket porter . William Basset . On the fourth of June in the afternoon I took out my horse for a ride , and about the middle of Deptford town I saw two fellows at an alehouse door with some fowls , and hearing Mr. Johnson had lost some the day before , I asked them what they had got there ; they said fowls , but their master was not there , and they could not sell them ; they were to carry them to the Boot and Crown at Deptford , and he was to come there to them . I went there and enquired for a constable , but there was none to be had there , so we got one at Greenwich . I told the men I believed their master had stole the fowls : at last the Prisoner came , and I took care they should not give him any item to get away . The Prisoner came into the house very boldly , and I asked him if he had any thing to sell ; he said , yes , he had got some fowls . I asked him if they were his fowls ; he said , yes . I had not patience to stand talking with him much , and I said if he did not give a good account how he came by them , I would charge a constable with him , which I did . There were six dozen and two of the fowls left , and I desired the constable to take care of the Prisoner and them till I rode to London . I went to Mr. Johnson 's , and acquainted him with it ; and when he came to Deptford I shewed him the prisoner , and he said that was the man ; and Mr. Johnson hired a landau , and brought him to London .

July 9 . Zachariah Price . I live with Mr. Truman , a brewer . I went down to Stanmore to see my friends , and was drinking at the Vine , a publick house on Tuesday last . A quarter before 12 at night Prisoner 's daughter came into the house in her and said her father was her mother to pieces . I run out of the house and met the Prisoner at the bar , about 40 rob from his house ; he had his coat over his arm , and nothing on but his shirt , and his shoes buckled , without stockings or breeches ; and his shut sleeves were all over blood . I asked him what he had been about ; he said he had killed his wife . I laid hold of his arm , and said he must go along with me , and he did not refuse going with me . I took him to the sign of the Vine , and as he was going along he threw his knife into a pond . Q . Did you see him throw it into the pond ? Price . I saw him throw something , I asked him what it was , and he said it was his knife . A constable was sent for , and he was secured . He had locked the door , and had the key in his pocket , and I took it out . About a quarter of an hour afterwards several of us went to his own house and went into a lower room , where he and his wife used to lie , and her body lay upon the bed , partly naked , without any bed clothes over her , and a chamber pot standing upon a chair , as I suppose , for her to bleed in ; though her head did not be directly over it , for she bled on one side of it . Her throat was cut , and her belly ript up , and she had a place cut in her cheek . Q . Did you observe whether the body was warm ? Price . Yes ; it was warm and her throat and belly were bleeding . In the morning we carried him before Justice Moore , and he asked him whether he was guilty of the murder , and he said , yes , he did murder her . Prisoner . I do n't say any thing against what he says . I was out of my senses , I did not know what I did . Something disturbed us so for several nights , that neither of us could rest or sleep . Q . Did he appear to be fuddled ? Price . He appeared sober enough for any thing that I could observe . William Wright . Mr. Price and I went out of the Vine together upon the alarm of the girl , and the sleeves of his shirt were as bloody as if they had been dipped in blood , and the some part of it was bloody . He had only his shoes and his shirt on ; and as he was coming along he threw his knife into a pond ; I saw where it went , and I went the next morning and took it out [ it was a small knife with a round pointed blade . ] He said he had murdered his wife , I asked him what made him do it , and he said he had been at work for the Lord . Q . Was he crazy sometimes ? Wright . He was a little crazy sometimes - He was a labouring man , I have worked with him sometimes . Q . Did you see his wife ? Wright . Not till the next day . I had only a glimpse of her . I did not care to see her . Q . Did you sit up with him all night ? Wright . Yes . Q . Did he appear to be disordered in liquor ? Wright . He was very sober all night . Q . Did he talk sensibly ? Wright . He said but little ; but what he said he talked sensibly . Q . Did his wife and he agree , or did they disagree ? Wright . They used to disagree sometimes - I do n't know that he ever offered any violence to her before . Prisoner . I did not know that I should do it till just that I went about it , for I was out of my senses , I was half mad . My wife said the devil was coming , and that frightened me , and so we went to fighting . I asked her for a halfpeny for a halfpeny candle , and she would not give it me , so I was in the dark , or else we used to have a light ; I did it innocently . Guilty , Death . 316 . + John Twyford , of St. Clement Danes , was indicted for that he not having the fear of God , & c. upon one John Mullins , wickedly , unlawfully and feloniously did make an assault , and the detestable sin of buggery did commit and do , which is not fit to be named among Christians , against the form of the Statute , & c . John Mullins . Some time in June I was going along near the Fleet Market , there was a press gang coming along , and the Gentleman at the bar stood looking at them : Said he , brother soldier , they will not press any Irishmen ; yes I said , I believe they will press any thing : he said he loved a soldier as he loved his life , and that he was a sea officer , and asked where there was a pot of good beer . and desired me to go and drink with him . We went to the Plough by the Fleet Market , and he would not let me pay any thing : he said he was going to the Talbot Inn in the Strand to a particular acquaintance of his , and desired I would go with him ; after much persuasion I went ; he asked me to lie there ; I told him I must go home , but he pressed me to stay , and he agreed for a bed for one shilling ; he persuaded me to go to bed ; I was very uneasy , and pretty much in liquor , and growing sleepy , I went into bed , and when he thought I was asleep , he began his tricks upon me ; I am almost ashamed to tell - he put his - into my fundament , and pushing so hard it awaked me . I asked him what he was at , and said he was not a Gentleman ; then we began to quarrel , and I being stronger than him turned him off , and then fell o'beating of him , and we were both carried to the watch-house . In the morning he said , brother soldier , you had better make this up : he said he had not much money about him , but he would give me half a crown , and he told me I must say that I was in liquor , and did not know what I said . Q . Did you say before the Justice that you was in liquor ? Mullins . Yes . Q . And did you say to the Justice that the complaint you had made to the constable was false ? Mullins . No ; I said it was not all true . Q . Did not you declare of your own accord that you was sorry for what you had done , and that you was drunk ? Mullins . No , I did not , I said I was in liquor . Robert Duck . I lay in the next room ; Mullins refused to go to bed , but at the persuasion of the Prisoner he did go to bed : when they had been in bed about a quarter of an hour , Mullins cried out very loud , what are you for , and made a great oath , and said , you are in my fundament , and then they fell o'fighting : then my master and mistress and five or six Gentlemen who were drinking in the house came up . Q . When they came into the room , did he complain to them of what the Prisoner had done ? Duck . Yes ; very much . Q . Were not they fighting before ? Duck . No - the prisoner was very much beat , Mullins was beating him upon the bed when the company went into the room . Q . Were they drunk or sober ? Duck . The prosecutor was the drunkest of the two . Oliver Pen . I do n't know the prisoner , I should know the soldier if I was to see him - that is he . They paid me for their lodging , that 's all I know of the matter . Q . Was there any complaint made when you went up ? Pen . Yes ; the soldier said the prisoner wanted to do so and so to him , and so they fell o'fighting . Q . What was the occasion of their quarrelling ? Pen . Because the prisoner wanted to be concerned with him . Q . Who did he say that to ? Pen . To all the whole room for what I know . I asked the soldier , and said , as you are a man of maturity , how could such a thing be acted to you , ( for you are not a boy ) without you was as willing as the other ? And then he said he had not entered his body ; then said I , you assaulted one another , and must leave it to the Court ; then I found they were both forsworn , for they must both of them be willing alike , or else there could not be any such thing done . In order to convict a person upon an indictment for sodomy , the act of parliament requires that the emission should be proved as well as the penetration , so the Jury acquitted the prisoner ; and he gave bail for his appearance next sessions at the Old Bailey , in order to take his trial for an assault with an intent to commit sodomy . 317 . + Catharine Wilcox * , of St. Mary Whitechapel , in the County of Middlesex , was indicted for stealing eight pounds ten shillings in money , the property of Thomas White , privately from his person , July 10 . * This Catharine Wilcox [ aged sixty years or upwards ] was tried in February sessions in the mayoralty of Sir Robert Willimott , Knt . for privately stealing 11 s. from the person of John Perthy [ a young man ] in some private conversation in an alley near Aldgate . See sessions paper , No . 3 . Page 89 , Trial 149. Thomas White . Yesterday about three o'clock in the morning I was going along Gracechurch Street . Q . Where had you been at that time o'night ? White . I had been drinking in Shoreditch with one Mr. Hope a brewer . The Prisoner and another woman hussled me , and took me hold by the middle , or much about that part . I had a handkerchief in my pocket , which I missed ; missing my handkerchief I thought this woman had robbed me . I followed them into Bell Alley , [ Petticoat Lane ] I think it is Bell Alley , it is by Whitechapel . Said I to this woman , when she was housed , mistress , pray give me my handkerchief , for I believe you have it , and I 'll give you more than it is worth , because I would have it again . I offered them two shillings for it several times , and they denied the taking it . I asked them for it abundance of times , and thought they would have taken the money for the handkerchief , because it is not worth more . I came out and went into the house two or three times ; I thought I would go into the house once more , so went in and asked them for it again : they said they could not do any thing till they had something to drink , so I put my hand in my pocket and gave them six pence to drink , thinking I should have got my handkerchief afterwards : then I offered them three shillings , and that would not do . I had three parcels of money in my pocket , and pulled out one parcel . Q . In what pocket was it ? White . In my coat pocket . I pulled out a bag in which was 8 l. 10 s. all in silver , which I had taken that day . Q . Who did you take it of ? White . Of Mr. Berry , a bacon man in Goswell Street . The Prisoner at the bar seeing this dog went to the door , and locked the door with me in the room . Said I , you shall not make me a Prisoner ; then I pressed to get out at the door , and while I was pressing I suppose she took the money out of my pocket , for the young woman who was there , [ Hannah Cutherson ] said , she [ the prisoner ] has got the money out of your pocket , see whether you miss any thing : then I put my hand into my pocket , and my money was gone ; the prisoner had the money in her hand , and I took it from her . Q . Where did you take it from her ? White . In the same room . Q . What did she say for herself ? White . I asked her what she did it for , but I do n't believe she made me any answer ; then the other woman said , tell your money , see that you have it all , so I put part of the money out of the bag upon the table , and the prisoner presently began to scramble , and she said she never saw so much money upon her table before . Q . How much did you tell of it ? White . I told about two or three pounds out of the parcel , and then she would not let me be at quiet . Q . What did she do to you ? White . She scrambled for the money , and I believe she took up some part of it : I told her if she meddled with me or my money , I would knock her down ; then she began to curse and swear , and said she would have some , and she took some by violence : when I found I was in such had hands , I was willing to get my money up as well as I could ; I told it afterwards at a publick house , and it wanted 8 s. 6 d. Prisoner . My Lord , I know no more of his handkerchief or his money than your Lordship . Pray , honest man , had I your handkerchief or your money ? you set down in the other woman 's lap , I did not take your money . Q . You say you took a bag of money out of your pocket to take six pence out to give them , are you sure you put your money into your pocket again ? White . Yes , as sure as I am of any thing in the world . Q . You say this was three o'clock in the morning . can you be sure what you did ? White . Yes ; I am very sure . Q . Did not you lay your money down upon the ? White . That was after I had taken the money from her . Hannah Cutherson . The prisoner and I met Mr. White in Gracechurch Street ; they talked together a little , and then she asked him if he would not go home with her . Q . Did he give his consent to go home with her ? Cutherson . I did not hear him say any thing , but they went along , and I went on too , sometimes before , and sometimes behind . As he was going along he complained that he had lost his handkerchief , and said , he loved justice and honesty . Then he went home with her into Bell Alley in Petticoat Lane ; when he came into the house , he asked her for his handkerchief , and said , he hoped there was justice there ; and that he missed his handkerchief in Gracechurch Street , and she said she knew nothing of his handkerchief , as she hoped to be saved : then he pulled a couple of shillings out of his pocket , and offered her for it , but she said she knew nothing of it . He went out at the door and came in again , and desired to have it , and said he would search us . I offered several times to be searched ; then he said he would give three shillings for it , he valued it so much . He said he had twenty pound about him , and that he would as leave have lost that as the handkerchief : then he pulled out a bag of money , and said , here 's a bag of money , and I have more in my breeches pockets both gold and silver ; and he put the money into his pocket again ; then the Prisoner went to the door and pushed it to , and asked him if he would give her something to drink ; he said , yes , if she would let him have his handkerchief ; but however , he would give her something to drink , and threw down six pence , and we had some gin and small beer , but he said he did not like any such liquor : then she locked the door , and he said he would not be locked in . I saw the bag in her hand , and I asked him if he had not lost something ; he said he had lost his bag ; he took hold of her hand , and took the bag out of her hand : I said you brazen face , how could you take the man 's money out of his pocket ? Q . Did you see her take it out of his pocket ? Cutherson . I did not see her take it , she said she would tell it for him ; he said , you brazen face do you want to rob me again : then he pulled out his money again , and laid it upon the table to tell it , and she scrambled , and said , she had not seen so much money upon her table a great while ; then she scrambled again , and scrambled some away from him , and he went to the alehouse and told the money over , and said he had lost 8 s. 6 d. and the Prisoner said , if she had known he had had that money he should never have brought it home . Prisoner . Who had you your handkerchief from ? White . I had it from you . Prisoner . Good Lord forgive me , I never had it ; I never saw it till he put his money in it , and she was sitting in his lap . Sure he will not offer to swear any such thing . Cutherson . I never sat in his lap , and the man never offered to touch me ; if I had thought she would have robbed him , I would have gone out of the house , and not have staid there . Prisoner . He took his money out of his pocket , and laid it upon the table , and sat upon my table an hour and an half . Q . How long was White there ? Cutherson . I believe what with going backwards and forwards , and disputing , it was a couple of hours . Mary Brooks . I have known the Prisoner 20 years , or more . Q . What is her character ? Brooks . I never heard a bad character of her - she winds Bengall silk . Ann Waters . I have known the Prisoner about a quarter of a year , she comes to my house sometimes ; but I have very little acquaintance or conversation with her . Q . What are you ? Waters . I am nothing at all - I have nothing to do but to take care of my family - my husband is a diamond cutter . Acquitted . 318. Thomas Ford , of London , was indicted for stealing a watch with a gold dial-plate , the inside case metal gilt with gold , the outside case covered with leather , imitating shagreen , except the edges , value 4 l. 4 s. the property of William Lambert , May 15 . William Lambert . I live at the corner of Abchurch lane , in Lombard street . On the 15th of May , I saw my boy under some concern , and he intimated that there was a watch taken out of the shop with a shagreen case , and a gold dial plate . I asked him who took it , he said there was a middle sized man , pitted with the small pox , came in to the shop , and he imagined he took it . I lodged an advertisement , which came out the 16th of May with a description of the watch and the person . I had given over all thoughts of it , and I think last Monday was 3 weeks a person sent for me to go into Bride lane , and asked me if I had not advertised a watch , and said that it was stopped , and the person with it . I went to a coffee house there , and saw the Prisoner in the coffee room up one pair of stairs ; they asked me if I knew the watch , I said , that was my watch . Q . What did you say about it to the Prisoner , or he to you ? Lambert . I could not say I never saw the Prisoner . He was carried to the Counter that night . When I was in the coach with him , he turned his face to me , and said , it lyes in your power to do me a great deal of service , and desired me to make it up , and he would have made it up at any rate , for he said his reputation would be spoilt . A gentleman intimated to him that his reputation would not be worth much long ; meaning that he would not live long , that he would be hanged . I desired he would give me an account how he came by it , and he said , God knows , he could not do that . He said at first his name was Matthew Man . When he was in the publick room at Guildhall , I desired him to give an account how he came by the watch ; he said first he had it of one in Southamp ton Row : I said he must find out who he had it of , or else he must stand in his shoes . And when my boy saw him , he told me that was the man , and then he told me he was not the man . Q . When the Prisoner was before the Alderman , did he deny it or not ? Lambert . He said that he bought it at the sign of the two chairmen , a publick-house near where his master lives . [ King 's Street Bloomsbury ] . John Berry servant to Mr. Lambert . Q . What have you to say as to the Prisoner 's taking a watch away ? Berry . I am certain , that on Wednesday the 15th of May , there was a person came into the shop very much like the Prisoner at the bar ; but I can not say the Prisoner is the person . Q . What did he say when he came into the shop ? Berry . He asked me several questions ; he asked me whether his watch was done , I told him I did not know we had any of his . He said it was an old one that he left with my master about a fortnight ago . I said if he left it , I was not at home , for I knew nothing of the matter . He said he would call again when my master was at home , and went away directly . After he was gone , I looked upon the place where the watch lay , and it was gone . There was another watch lay by it , but I missed that watch which is in court . I saw it there when he was in the shop , and knowing of no body else could come in but him , I went out to look after him , but I could not directly see which way the person went . I came in again directly , and then I was in a great concern , that the watch which was brought in when my master was out should be taken away . I acquainted my master with it , and described the person to him , as dressed in blue grey , turned up with yellow plush , and yellow buttons . Q . Did you give any other description of him ? Berry . Yes ; that he had his own hair , was middle sized , and pitted with the small-pox . Q . Look upon the prisoner , can you or can you not take upon you to say the Prisoner is the man ? Berry . I can not take upon me to say he is the man . Q . Do you believe him to be the man ? Berry . There are circumstances which make me think so . Q . Do you remember your going to Guildhall , and seeing the Prisoner in the Long Room ? Berry . Yes . Q . What did you say to your master then ? Berry . I said he was the man . Q . What did you say before the Alderman ? Berry . I could not be certain then . Q . For what reason ? Berry . I thought his speech was altered , and when he was in the Long Room he was leaning . John Piercy . I live in St. Bridge 's church yard , in Fleetstreet . - I am a pawnbroker . On Monday the 17th of July , the person at the bar , Thomas Ford , came to my house , being recommended by a neighbour to borrow 10 l. I desired to see the security , and he shewed me this watch , and said it cost him 15 guineas . I said , Sir , this will not do for this money , for it is not all gold . There was a young man who waits on me was by me , he saw the name of the maker , and looks upon the register . I keep a register where I enter all the stolen watches in , every day from the advertiser . I saw that the case was not gold , though to some eyes it may appear to be gold . I asked him , is this gold ? he said it was . I asked him where he bought it , he said , I bought it of a person who comes to our house . Where do you live , said I ? With my Lord Portmore , he said . I said , I think it is very odd your ambition should induce you to wear a gold watch ? and asked him what he was , but he did not care to satisfy me in that particular ; so I did not press him . He was actually very genteely dressed , as any man could well be . Q . Was he in a livery ? Piercy . No , he was in the same dress he is now , as far as I could see : he might be my Lord Portmore himself , for I do n't know his Lordship . I told him it was not gold , he rapped out an oath , and said , then I am deceived . My young man having looked upon the register , gave me a nod to go backwards . I looked at the advertisement , and found it agreed , so I put the watch in my pocket after this manner as I do now . He cursed me , and said , G - d - your blood , what do you mean by putting my watch into your pocket ? I told him I would shew him by what authority , so I shewed him the advertisement to read ; he started up and said he would soon bring the owner of it , who would release him and the watch , and make me suffer for what I had done . So as he passed out of the shop I followed him , b staying to speak to a neighbour , I lost fight of the gentleman . I went after him and met him crossing from Salisbury court to Shoe lane . I said , Sir , I want to speak with you ; you must go back to my house ? he said he was going to seek the person he had the watch of . I had him by the coat , and he desired me to let him go . I still insisted that he should go back with me , but when entreaties were to no purpose , I was resolved to have him back by main force , and in struggling he crossed the way , being stronger than I . Then , my Lord , he up 's with a stick to strike at me , and some how or other I struck it out of his hand , and told him if he would not go decently I would cane him as he would have done me ; then I suppose he thought it was the best way to go quietly , which he did . I did not think proper to carry him to my own house , so I carried him to a house shown by the name of Anderson coffee house , and sent for a constable . I asked him what the watch cost him ; he said it cost 50 s. then he said he bought it at the two chairmen . I sent for Mr. Lambert , and when he came , I asked him what sort of a watch he had lost , he said it was a watch with a shagreen case , the inside metal gilt , and gilt on the edges . I asked him the number of it , and he said he believed it was from 422 to 427 , [ It was one of those numbers . ] The next morning I went with Mr. Lambert and carried him before Alderman Gibbon , and he was committed to Newgate . Prisoner . I think about six weeks ago I happened to go into Bloomsbury square , I met a man about my size , and he asked me to buy a silver watch , I went with him into the two chairmen , he asked me 10 l. 10 s. for it , and at last came down to 50 s. and I gave it him . Ann Jones . About six weeks ago I went into the two chairmen - in King 's street , by Bloomsbury , and I saw the Prisoner and another man in a blue grey coat , and he in the blue grey was bargaining to sell a watch , and asked the Prisoner 3 guineas for it , the Prisoner said he would not give so much , he would give him 50 s. and he would give no more ; and in a little time the Prisoner gave him the money . Q . What sort of a case had it ? Jones . It looked like black leather . - I was sitting with a young woman who was waiting for somebody , and lives in the neighbourhood ; and I said there were just now two men bargaining about a watch , and now they are gone : when I saw her again , she said you told me there were two men bargaining for a watch at the two Chairmen ; one of those men is taken up for stealing a watch ; I said I would go and see whether it was the same person . Q . What are you ? Jones . I live with my brother Robert Brown a tidewaiter in Angel Alley Whitechapel , and as he is a widower , I save him the expence of a servant . I have lived in several families in Gloucestershire , I lived with my Lady Cholmondley . Thomas Caddy . I have known the Prisoner a year and an half as a fellow servant ; he went away but last October ; he lived with Mr. Nicholls of Enfield , and afterwards he went to live with my Lord Castlecomer ; and when he asked Esquire Nicholls if he was honest , he said he had nothing to say against him for that . John Piercy . As to what this woman has said with respect to the manner of buying the watch , it is quite different from what he said , for he said he bought it in such a private manner , that neither the master nor the mistress of the house could tell that he bought it .

I saw the Prisoner when he was going before the Alderman , and asked him if he was one of the persons that robbed a house on Clerkenwell Green , and he said he was . James Bye . This Martin belonged to the Black Boy Alley gang : the Prisoner , and I , and Jeffs , ( who is executed ) went out about the sixth of May with an intent to go a robbing . Martin took a hanger , I had a dark lanthorn , and Jeffs had two bunches of keys : we went into a Court on Clerkenwell Green , and heard some people talking in the parlour , and Jeffs said this is the house , let us wait for it . we stood I believe about a couple of minutes , and Martin went and opened the outer door , which opened with a latch , and the stairs went strait up from the door ; he said he would go up and try if he could open the kin door , which is a nickname we have for a parlour door : he gave Jeffs the hanger , went up stairs into the room , threw up the sash , and threw out three blankets , a quilt , and a sheet , and Jeffs catched them . We sold them to Mrs. Lucas ( wife of Joseph Lucas , who is executed ) for five shillings , and we divided the money between us , and went to the notified Hawkins 's in Golden Lane , who harbours nothing but thieves from morning till night .

On Whitson Monday I was at Mr. Brozet 's at the Half Moon in the Strand buying some cambrick , and the Prisoner came in : he asked Mr. Brozet if his name was Brozet , and put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a pocket-book , and presented this note to Mr. Brozet , ( I marked the note ) I think it had these endorsements then , it was the same then as it is now . Mr. Brozet asked him where he had the note , and he said he had it from a merchant in the city : Mr. Brozet replied , Sir , this note is not my note , for I do n't know the drawer : the Prisoner replied again , and said , Sir , I found it , upon his saying that , we took him directly before Sir Thomas De Veil . - Brozet , jun . This acceptance is not my father 's handwriting , it is very far from it ; his name to the acceptance is spelt wrong , there are two ( tt 's ) and there should be but one . Q .

Nobody I do assure you . [ The bill was produced and read as in the indictment . ] John Kilsey . Mr. Robinson [ the Prisoner , ] and Mr. Ford [ one who was in custody with him ] on Whitsonday in the evening shewed me this bill , and asked if it was a good bill ; I said I believed it to be a very good draught ; said I , it is over due , how came you by it ? He said he found it in the street by the New Market : said I , is it advertised ? He said he could not tell how to look into the advertisement ; said I , go and shew it to Mr. Brozet , see what he says to it ; I thought it was a good negotiable note . William Mar . I lodged in the Prisoner 's house ; he shewed me two papers , and desired me to read them for him ; I told him I could not read them ; then , said he , you can not read them any more than I. Justinian Ekins . I am a brewer at Westminster ; I have known the Prisoner about five months , he has paid me very honestly for what he has had ; I take him to be a very honest man . Q . Can he write ? Ekins . Yes ; but he writes a very ordinary hand . Jonathan Nutter . I have known the Prisoner about three years , and never heard any other character of him than that of an honest man . Q . Do you know his hand-writing ? Nutter . I know he writes as ordinary an hand as any person I ever knew in my life . Prisoner 's Council . This acceptance is in a very good hand . It not being proved that he made a demand of the money , he was acquitted . 321.

James Spratley . On the 16th of June my wife and I went out for a day 's pleasure ; I was informed my house was broke open , and my drawers stripped : when I heard of it , I said the prisoner was the person that did it , for she was standing at the door when I went out at five o'clock in the morning . I got a warrant , and had her taken up at her lodgings in Newtoner 's Lane : there were several of the things found upon her . She owned she broke open the house , and in what manner she did it : she said she attempted to take down a shutter , but she could not , so she took out the pannel of the door with a casement hook . Elizabeth Spratley . Confirmed her husband 's evidence , and said the Prisoner had been a lodger in the house , but the person she lay with had quarrelled with her , and turned her out , and she lay all night upon the stairs . The Prosecutor being only an inmate , it could not be his dwelling house ; so the Prisoner was acquitted of stealing in the dwelling house , and found guilty of the felony . [ Transportation .

William Kelly , Thomas St. Legar , and Patrick Cane , of St. Martins in the Fields , were indicted for assaulting Thomas Piggott , Esq ; on the King 's highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a silver watch , value 20 l. and forty guineas , his property , May 23 . 330. Sarah Cane for receiving the said watch , knowing it to be stolen , May 24 . Thomas Piggott . On Thursday the 23d of May , I supped with some West India merchants at the King 's Arms Tavern , in Lombard street . About eleven o'clock we paid the bill , and ordered the waiter to get a Coach . We waited the return of the porter , but no coach could be got . Between 11 and 12 it being a fine star-light night , I put my sword and cane under my arm and walked . When I had just got beyond Somerset house , I saw Kelly and St. Legar behind me ; and there was a drunken soldier before me , who staggered so , that he hindered my passing ; when I found I could not easily get by , I whipped into the street in order to pass by him ; then Kelly and St. Legar followed me ; when I came to one of the dark passages in the Strand , I stopped to let them pass me , for I thought they wanted to walk faster than I ; and when I stopped , they stopped . I thought it was done out of complaisance . When I came to Buckingham street in the Strand , I turned down four or five yards , thinking it was Villars street where I live , but seeing the gate at the end of the street , I found my mistake , and returned ; at the end of the street in the Strand , that poor man Cave looked me full in the face , Kelly seized me with his left hand by the throat , and put a pistol or something like it to my temples , and thrust it as hard as he could against them , and swore by his Maker if I spoke a word he would blow my brains out . I said do n't use me ill , it is not in my power to resist you , gentlemen , I see what you are about , and I can not hinder you . Q . Who were then present ? Piggott . They were all three present , and Kelly said , D - n you , you son of a b - h , do you speak , by G - d if you do , I 'll murder you ; upon that I was quite silent , and made no reply . He still kept hold of me by the collar ; then he took hold of my watch string , he could not easily get the watch out , so he tore open my breeches , and took the watch out and put it into his pocket . Then he put his hand into my right hand pocket , and took out all my silver and brass , I believe about 10 s. He searched with his hand on the side of my breeches , till he felt the purse ; by his hurry I thought he would have torn the purse out . I said you may take it , he said , D - n you , you son of a b - h , you shall give it me , and I gave him the purse with 40 odd guineas ; I think there were 44 guineas and a half in it . As soon as he had got that , he put his right hand upon my shoulder and turned my face down towards Buckingham street , and he swore by his Maker if I made a noise or offered to follow him , he would murder me , and bid me go down that street . Just as I turned the corner I received a stroke on the left side of my neck with some weapon , which I suppose was done with a design to knock me down . Q . Had St. Legar any weapon ? Piggott . While Kelly was robbing me , St. Legar stood just before me with a drawn sword , and held the pint of it close to my breast , and Cave stood on the left hand with a drawn hanger over my head . I did intend to purse them , and I should certainly have overtaken them before they came to the watch , but my breeches being unbuttoned hindered me . I called to the watch , and said I was robbed by three men , and the watchman said they were just run by him ; he asked me if I thought I should know them again , I said , yes ; he said go home and change your clothes and follow them , but I thought they would certainly be housed before I could do that . I acquainted Mr. Bowley , the watchmaker in Lombard street with the robbery , and concluded to advertise my watch , with ten guineas reward ; he advised me not to advertise it as stole , but as lost , and then I might possibly have it again . I advertised it on Saturday the 25th of May . Mr. Hall seeing the advertisement that morning , went to Mr. Bowley , and told him that such a watch had been offered to him to be pawned to him for three guineas , and he refused to take it in . Mr. Hail 's boy found out where the woman lived who pawned it , in Scroop 's court against St. Andrew 's church in Holborn . Mr. Hall 's boy went with me to Cave 's house , ( for this woman was Cave 's wife . ) I told her if she did not let me have the watch I would send for a constable , and send her to Bridewell . Then she said she had it of one St. Legar . I found by examining her , that Kelly and St. Legar lodged at Cave 's house ; I sent for a case of pistols , and waited a whole day over against the house , but none of them came . A woman gave intimation to Cave 's wife , that Kelly was in trouble about a watch ; I had information of a place of resort , and went with a woman to one Raddy 's , in Catharine street in the Strand , in order to find out Kelly 's wife , for Hall 's boy followed the boy Wood * , who came for Kelly 's wife . But when they found they were watched , Wood run away , and Kelly 's wife was housed at Raddy 's . As I was talking , I discovered Wood , and told him I believed he was an accomplice , and if he would not make a discovery , I would take him up . * This Wood was in custody upon this account . He said , did I rob you , what business have you to take me up ? I sent Kelly 's wife to the Counter that night , and went to Raddy 's again to look after these fellows ; and Raddy told me , if you get your watch again , and some part of the money , I believe you will be easy : I said I should be glad to have my watch again , but as to my money I did not expect . I told him by what he had said about the watch , I knew him to be an ill man , and I would take care to get him punished ; and he said , master , if I am rightly informed , every part of the money is in Kelly 's wife 's drawers : I said I would not go about it at that time o'night for fear of being knocked on the head ; and I said , if you do n't assist me in taking these fellows , and shew some degree of honesty , you shall be punished . He afterwards informed me , that the boy I had taken up [ Wood ] had the watch . I went to the boy to the Counter , and he told me he had lain upon the ground all night , and I gave him two shillings for his lodging : then he told me the watch was at one Sarah Holland 's in Stewart 's Rents in Dirty Lane , in a cushion , in a two armed chair , in a paper . I went there , there was a great mob , and with much persuasion and many promises they let me into the room ; when I got into the room , I went directly to the two armed chair , and found the watch in a white paper in the inside of the cushion among the hair . Patrick Cave was apprehended , and desired to speak to me ; he was going to say something to me , I said , I do not want you to say any thing , for I know all your faces very well ; and he said he would give me information where the other people were , and I believe he did all that was in his power to find them out+ . + Kelly and St. Legar were taken the 5th of June in the Minories for an assault , in knocking down a bricklayer 's man for looking at them : they were carried to the watch-house without Aldgate , and safely conveyed to the Counter by Mr. Day the beadle of Portsaken Ward ; there was a powder horn and a brass ball found in Kelly 's pocket . Cave . I would ask the Gentleman , whether I did not offer to come to him if he would not molest me , and went to Esquire Piggott , and told him all I knew . Piggott . When I came to Raddy 's house , Raddy said I am very glad you are here , for I have received a message from Cave , that he is under a vast concern , and can not eat or drink , and that he would be glad to see you if you will promise not to take him that night ; I told him I would not take him that night ; he came and we had a great deal of talk . I did design to admit that man [ Cave ] an evidence , but I was told my recognizance would be estreated , and I must prosecute . Edmund Hall . I am a pawnbroker in Gray's-Inn Lane . Sarah Cave brought this watch to me , and wanted three guineas upon it . I asked her whose it was ; she said it was a gentleman 's : I told her I did not chuse to lend any money upon it without seeing the gentleman : she came again , and said , what signifies seeing the gentleman ; but I would not have any thing to do with it . I sent my boy to Dawson 's at Furnival's-Inn Cellar , and there was a man in a livery [ which I take to be Cave ] and the woman gave the watch to him . William Parrot . My master said he would not lend any money upon it without seeing the gentleman , and he bid me go with her ; she was unwilling I should go ; I went with her to Furnival's-Inn Cellar , and the prisoner Patrick Cave came and consabulated with me some time , and Mrs. Cave gave the watch I believe to Patrick Cave himself , and then she said the gentleman does not care you should see him , and so you may go back again . My master seeing the advertisement , said , the watch the woman brought , is stole . I went to Mr. Bowley 's , and told him what had happened , and I found Mrs. Cave , out in Scroop 's Court in Holborn . I said , Mrs. Cave , you must give a particular account how you came by this watch , or you will bring yourself into further trouble , and then she said she had it from St. Legar . Patrick Cave . As I was coming home to my own house from my master 's at Lambeth after twelve o'clock , I saw Mr. Piggott pass by , he was dressed well : I had my master 's hanger under my arm , and I saw Kelly and St. Legar in the Strand , and I came up with them . I was there to be sure . Mr. Piggott advertised the watch , and my wife owned she had it , I gave it to her . I lived with Mr. Ward about four years , and had a good character , and never was concerned in any such thing before ; and when I met him , I told him I would do him all the service I could , and inform him of the haunts of the persons who were concerned with me , and so I did . St. Legar . I never was concerned in any robbery with either of them . Kelly . I have nothing to say , but I leave myself to God and your Honours . Cave . St. Legar came into my house , took a watch out of his pocket , and laid it upon the table . I was surprised how he should have a watch , because I never saw one with him before : the next day I was desired by Mr. St. Legar to pawn this watch . St. Legar . It is very hard she should say I gave her the watch , when Cave gave her the watch . Q . Did your husband give you the watch , or did St. Legar give it you ? Cave . St. Legar gave me the watch . William Kelly , Thomas St . Legar , Patrick Cave , guilty , Death . Sarah Cave guilty as an accessary . The Prosecutor recommended Patrick Cave to the Court for mercy . [ Cave : Transportation . See summary . ] 331. Ann Roach , was indicted for stealing a silver cream pot , value 30 s. the goods of Thomas Kahagan , June 13 . Thomas Kahagan . About a fortnight or three weeks ago I lost a silver cream pot . I believe it was taken out of my house . The Prisoner at the bar carried the cream pot to be pawned . Q . Was the cream pot that was lost yours ? Kahagan . I thought it was , I acknowledged it as such . Q . Was it pledged to you ? Kahagan . It was not pledged to me , but it was in my custody . Q . If it was in your possession , how did you come by it ? Kahagan . I did not buy it myself . Evan Scriven . I live with Mr. Beasley , in St. Martin 's lane . On the 27th of June the Prisoner brought this cream pot to me , and wanted 15 s. upon it . I asked her whose it was , she said it was her own . I told her I did not believe it was her own . Then said she give it me again ; No , I said I would not . Then to tell , you the truth , it is my mitress 's ; I asked who her mistress was , she said , she was a pretty lady , and kept by some Lord . I said I would go and speak to her mistress . No , she said , I should not , she would not disturb the Lord , for she should lose her place if she did . I followed her to a Lord 's in St. James 's square , where her husband lives , and acquainted him with it ; he said she was his wife , but he had no such pot . I took her up , and then she pretended she bought it at the shop of one Mr. Caprio , a silver smith in St. Martin 's lane . I went to him , and he said some time ago he sold her a milk pot , but he could not tell whether this was it or not . Sir Thomas would not discharge the warrant , but directed us to advertise it . I advertised it , and Mr. Kahagan came to our house to enquire after it ; he said if it was his it had a K upon each foot , ther care three K 's . Q . How came you by the pot ? Kahagan . My wife , I believe , bought it . I am not positive whether she did or not ; but the pot has been mine these three years . Evan Scriven . She confessed before the Justice that it was Mr. Kahagan 's , and that she stole it out of his parlour . Prisoner . I bought that pot in Ireland , it is marked with three K 's . Guilty . 332.

The evidence of Jones the Prosecutor , and Harper the accomplice , with regard to the robbery , were much the same , as on that trial to which I refer you , December sessions , Number 3 , page 42 , trial 78. William Harper . The Prisoner was taken up about about two sessions ago , and I could not take upon me to swear to him then , because somebody had pushed a stick in his eye , and his eye was almost out , and the blood ran over his face ; he has a mark upon the back of his hand . [ Now he swore positively that the prisoner was one of the gang that robbed Mr. Jones ] Prisoner . When I was carried to the Poultry Counter , I was carried before Harper , and he was asked whether I was the person , and he said he is not the Norman , the other Norman was pitied with the small pox , and he is a head taller ; [ the prisoner was not pitied with the small pox . ] Aaron Lovi . When Norman was first taken , Harper said he did not believe him to be the man , and afterwards he desired me to tell the Sheriffs he believed he was the man . Charles Remmington , otherwise Long Charles . Harper told the prisoner that he had hanged men enough already , and he did not care to hang any more for fear of being killed . Harper . Those were not the words ; I said I would not say any thing till I came before my Lord Mayor . Remmington . Those were the words he said . Q . How long did you know the prisoner before he was taken up ? Harper . About three or four years : I thought he was the same man at first , but when I saw the marks upon his hand I was positive .
