Why , said I , did not you rob Mr Leake , and if you robbed him of that Skin you robbed me ; said I , I am sorry you should be guilty of it . He denied it , but after he found I had come at the Skin he confess 'd it , and said , he would give a Guinea for the Skin , or any Thing to make it up . - Freeman . I am a Tanner . I bought a Calf's-Skin of the Prisoner that very Day that Mr Leake came and claimed it in my Yard . - Smith . I have known the Prisoner a great many Years , he is a Currier , I have known him from an Infant , he worked for my Husband 12 Months , and he behaved very well - as a just and honest Servant , and I do not think he would be guilty of Theft , or Felony , and was he to be clear of this Fact , I would employ him again To-morrow - I live in Black and White-Court in the Old-Baily : Your humble Servant , Sir . - Deval .

The Prisoner came into my Shop the 23d of March , and asked to see some China-Basons , and bid Money for one ; and as the Person that served her looked another Way , she took an Opportunity , as it is imagined , to conceal one under her Cloak ; she went to the next China-Shop to see some Plates , and while the Person that served her went to take some Things off the Shelf , she took a China-Dish . My Bason was found upon her ; my Neighbour came to me , and asked me , If she had bought a China-Bason of me : I said , No : says he , I took this Bason from her . - This is my Bason ; here is my own Hand-writing upon it ; I am sure I had it in my Shop that Day .

I live with Mrs Ashbourner , who keeps a China-Shop not far from Mr Vere 's : We were all at Dinner except my Mistress , who was in the Shop ; the Prisoner had stole a Dish , and my Mistress had taken it from her ; I followed the Prisoner to see if she had got any Thing else ; she had a Bundle along with her ; I think it was under her Arm ; I desired to see what was in it ; I looked into her Bundle and saw this Bason , and took it out of her Bundle ; she came back along with me , or the Mob brought her after me , I am not certain which ; when she came into the Shop , our Man turned up the Bason and saw this Gentleman 's Mark upon it , for he knows his Mark . Charles Vere . I have locked this Bason up ever since , and Casebury told me , when he delivered it to me then , that he took it out of her Bundle . Prisoner . I went into the City to buy something , and went into this Gentleman 's Shop , and asked to see some China-Basons ; he shewed me two Basons ; I asked him the Price ; he said , he sold them generally for 18 d. but I should have One at 17 d. I bid 14 d. and afterwards 14 d.

Q . What Day was this ? Mackenzie . It was this Day three Weeks . - It was a blue and white Landskip , with a blue Spot at the Bottom , ( the Bason was produced , and she was asked whether that was the Bason ) it was this Pattern , but I can not swear to the Bason . - It was such a Pattern , white on the Inside , with a little blue at the Bottom as that is . Ann Tipper . I was coming from Tower-Hill with this Gentlewoman ( Mrs Mackenzie ) and met Alice Burk in Fleetstreet , she said she was going to buy some China ; I told her she had better let it alone till another Time , but she said she must do it for Fear of disobliging a Friend ; and she bought a Bason of a Woman who had some China in a Basket . Q . Is that the Bason ? Tipper . It was this Pattern . ( This Evidence did hardly look at the Bason ) . Mary Innys .

Hannah Ashbourner . On the 23d of March , the Prisoner at the Bar came into my Shop , and asked for some enamelled China Plates . I turned my Back to her , and took some off the Shelf ; I showed them her , and told her the Price ; she said they were a great deal too dear ; I told her I could not take much less . She said she must have them cheaper , for she had broke three of a Gentlewoman 's Plates , and that the Gentlewoman said they cost her 4 s. said I , you had better give the four Shillings to the Person ; she stood humming and hawing and would not stir ; said I , Good Woman , you had better go away ; says she , look a little farther ; said I , Prithee go about your Business , and I espied under her Arm something of China ; thinks I , she may have been somewhere else and bought some . When she was got two or three Steps from the Counter , said I , Mistress , What have you got there ? So I took hold of her , and saw my own Dish . I was almost frightened to Death . Said I , Oh , you Bold Face , you have got my Dish . I called up my Servant , and said , This Bold-Face has stole my Dish . She wanted to put the Dish down ; I took the Dish from under her Arm ; she had a short Cloak over it . I was glad to get my Dish , and I let her go . Says some Body , have you lost nothing else ? Says the Boy , I will run after her and see ; so he went over the Bridge as far as the Pastry-Cook 's ; says he , I am come to see whether you have any Thing else of my Mistress 's ; and she and the Bason were brought back to my Shop . Prisoner . The Dish lay upon the Counter ; I did take the Dish up in my Hand , but with no Intent to steal it , or of covering it , but my Short-Cloak fell down over it , and the Gentlewoman thought I was going to steal it ; says she , What are you going to steal my Dish ? and took it from me . There are three or four Ladies of Quality that I lived with , but they are out of Town , or they would have come to give me a Character . Guilty 4 s. 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 188.

I found Sugar in his Apron , and in the Inside of his Cloaths , in his Bosom , besides what he had got in his Apron and Handkerchief . Jury . Had he no Pocket ? Mascall . No , he had no Pocket at all ; the Sugar would have fell through between his Coat and Waistcoat if he had gone far . When I laid hold of him he seemed to be in a Fit , or drunk , or not well , and was very rustical , and I was obliged to get a Cart to carry him . He would not acknowledge any thing till he found he was mastered , and I had got him into the Cart ; and then he said he had got the Sugar under Botolph's-Wharf Gateway . - He is a Person that goes about the Keys to pilfer what he can . Q . How do you know that ? Mascall . I know it very well , he was in the House of Correction two or three Days before that for the same Practices . - He owned he took it out of the Warehouses . Q . How has he an Opportunity of doing that ? Mascall .

I was not before the Justice , I did not hear him mention whether he took them or no . Prisoner . I do not know that I said any such Thing , if I did I was suddled ; I had a Friend came to me , and they had given me a little Drink , and that is a Thing I do not accustom myself to . The Prisoner 's Maid . I am a hired Servant to the Prisoner , I have 50 s. a Year ; he was taken ill that Night and went to Bed before it was dark - that very Night the Wheels were brought into the Yard . Q . How came you to remember it was the Night when the Wheels were brought there ? The Maid . Because they were taken away the next Day - my Master did not continue in Bed all the next Day , he got up about Nine o'Clock in the Morning . Q . Could he have got out of Bed and have gone out in the Night without your knowing of it . The Maid . One of the Children was sick with him , and I sat up all Night with him and his Child - that very Night before Mr Sims came and found the Wheels in the Yard - I never saw the Wheels ; the Prisoner has seven small Children . Thomas Stubbs . The Prosecutor says one Thing , and the Servant another ; I think the Prosecutor is a Man that is not fit to be trusted ; I have known the Prisoner several Years , and he always was a very honest Man . Sims . I missed the Wheels about Eight or Nine in the Morning , that Girl was Mistress of the House then , the good Woman of the House was not at home , she was gone from him with a little Child ; I believe she can very well tell whether he was up all Night or no .

I desired him to get what he could ready on Tuesday Night , in order to be sent into the Country the next Morning . - The Doors were shut ; there is a Sash-Window on each Side of the Door , and Grates before them , which were fastened to the House . - I had 120 Pound Weight of Chocolate brought from the Office , which had been sent there to be stamped . It was brought in on the Saturday ; and the Monday before the Tuesday Night on which this happened , it was put in the Window to dry , because it is damp when it comes from the Office . - It lay about two Foot from the Window . My Man was in the Shop heading two or three Barrels , and I was in the Compting-House ; I saw the Chocolate fall down , and did not know but it might be the heading of the Barrels that might have disturbed it . My Man presently went to the Door , then came and called me , and told me that I had been robbed . When I came , I found that there was 26 Pound of Chocolate taken away , and the Grate was likewise taken away , and thrown into the Street , which I did not find till about two Hours afterwards . There was a Coachman going into the Green-Dragon Inn , his Horses would not go along , which was occasioned by the Grate lying in the Street , which the Coachman took up and carried into the Inn-Yard . At last seeing a good many People looking at something , I went to see what it was , and found the Grate lying in the Inn-Yard . The Chocolate was sold to one Jane Johnson , who lives in Rag-Fair for 26 Shillings . David Shields .

Thomas Meckwold . I live in Great-Russel-Street , St. Giles 's .

Elizabeth Smart . On the 24th of February , about Seven o'Clock in the Evening , I perceived that the Sash of the Parlour-Window , belonging to Mr Meckwold 's House , which had been shut all Day , was open , and that the Blind , which had been up all Day , was down . Eleanor Goddard . I am Fellow-Servant with the last Witness . On the 24th of February , about Seven o'Clock at Night , being in the Kitchen , I heard a Noise and went to see what was the Matter , and found that the Sash , which was close all Day long , was pushed up , and that the Blind was down . Thomas Simmonds . I am a Lodger opposite to Mr Meckwold 's House , and about Seven o'Clock at Night , or rather after , on the 24th of February , being disposed in a lazy sort of a Condition , I was looking out of the Window ( the Moon shone bright on that Side of the Way , and I could see as well as if it was Day ) and I saw George Watson and another consulting together and looking hard at Mr Meckwold 's Window ; ( the Sash being then up ) my Wife was in the Room with me , said I , My Dear , I believe here are two young Men who want to get into Mr Meckwold 's House ; they both went up to the Door and set their Shoulders against it , and gave a Shove , then went about ten Doors farther to another Door , and there they stood consulting again for some Time ; at last , when the People were not in such a Hurry in passing and repassing , the Prisoner left his Companion and came to this Window again , and looked at it very hard ; there was a Woman coming along , he met her and then turned back , and as soon as the Woman was passed him , ( for there was no Body else in the Street , passing or repassing ) he jumps on the Rail before the Window , and put his Hand over and took down the Blind - the Sash was up so high that you might put your Hand over the Blind - there was Room for a Hand to go in , and that was all ; my Wife bid me open the Window and call out ; No , said I , I do not think that so well , I will go down and take him in the House ; said I to a Journyman , who works in the same House with me , There 's a Man in the House over the Way , let us go and secure him : I went down Stairs , and as soon as I had opened the Door , the Prisoner at the Bar jumped out of the Window , over the Rail , and came on our Side of the Way ; he ran by me , said I to the young Man , who was with me , Richard , lay hold of him , and Richard laid hold of him directly ; as soon as he had laid hold of him , there were two Men on our Side of the Way ( tho ' I saw but one before ) and they run upon us almost ready to devour us , Richard was surprised , and I too , but they went off , and we saw no more of them ; said I to Richard , This is the Man that I saw at the Window , I am sure of it , so we charged a Constable with him , and took him to the Round-house ; - I am sure the Prisoner is the Man . Sarah Simmonds . I saw the Prisoner at Mr Meckwold 's Window , on the 24th of February , about Seven o'Clock in the Evening ; he met a Woman and immediately turned about , and as soon as she was past , he jumped up to the Rail , took down the Blind of the Window and put his Head and Arms in at the Window ; my Husband went down Stairs directly in order to catch him , and just as he was going out at the Door , the Prisoner jumped off the Rail and crossed to our Side of the Way , to our Door . - I am sure he is the Man that put his Head and Arms into Mr Meckwold 's House . John Cooke . I was trimming the Gentleman 's Lamp ; I saw the Prisoner loitering about , and saw his Hand upon the Window , and he was coming out over the Rail ; I did not suspect him at first , for I took him to be a Servant to the Gentleman , and therefore did not stop him ; I heard he was taken afterwards . - I saw him coming out of the Window as well as I see him at the Bar now . Richard Glover . I was sent for to take Charge of the Prisoner ; I asked what was the Matter ; they said , he had endeavoured to rob the Gentleman 's House ; as I was following the Person who was carrying him to the Round-house , out comes a Man with a drawn Cutlass , and threatened to strike at the Man who had hold of him , and said , Loose him , and when he said that , I whipp 'd out my Truncheon to defend my Head , and the Prisoner and he ran away , one took to one Side of the Church , and the other to the other Side ; however , I pursued the Prisoner , and cried out , Stop Thief , and he turned up Manmouth-Street ; there was a young Man got up with him and took hold of him , and they were tumbling one upon the other when I got up with him and took him again . Q. to Elizabeth Smart . How is this Blind fastened ? Smart . The Blind is fastened with a little Bolt which shoots into the Frame of the Window . Q . Are you sure it was bolted at Seven o'Clock ? Smart . I am sure it was bolted at that Time - I am sure it was bolted all Day ; I am very sensible the Prisoner opened it ; my Lady and my Master went out , and I am sure neither of them went into the Parlour ; I bolted it in the Morning , and I think I can safely say it was bolted all Day , because there was no Body to open it , unless I had unbolted it myself . Q. to Mr. Meckwold . Was there any Thing lost or moved ? Mr Meckwold . I found a Tea-Chest moved out of its Place , but there was nothing taken away . Prisoner . Ask them if I got into the House at all ? Thomas Simmonds . He was as far in as his Breast , Arms and his Head , so as that he might reach the Ground with his Hand . Sarah Simmonds . His Arms and Head and Shoulders were in , he reached down and : put the Blind upon the Ground . Eleanor Goddard was called again , and asked , Whether the Blind was fixed to the Sash ? Goddard . The Sash and the Blind are different Things ; the Blind is fixed , and the Sash may be pushed up , and the Blind remain fixed ; the Blind is fastened with a Bolt , which is on the Top of the Blind , and goes into the Side of the Frame of the Window . Q . The Question is , Whether , when he pushed the Sash up , the Blind must not fall down . Goddard . It can not fall by the lifting up of the Sash ; but it stood safe against the Side of the Window . Q . If the Blind had fell down , whether you must not have heard it ? Goddard . I believe we might , but it stood very safe by the Side of the Window . Simmonds . He jump 'd up on the Rail ; he laid one Hand upon the Frame of the Window , and the other Hand was upon the Top of the Blind , then he too k the Blind down with his Hand and made a Reach , and lay over the Window as if he was going to see the Blind down upon the Ground Guilty , Death . 197 , 198.

John Brown , for receiving the same , knowing them to be stole , March 3 . William Staples , Junior . On Thursday , the 3d of March , about Ten o'Clock in the Morning , one Elizabeth Harris came to my Warehouse , and another Woman with her , and desired my Man to call me down ; she told me , she wanted some Flannel ; I asked her , What Sort ; she said , A low Sort ; I shewed her some , and told her , the Price was 10 d. per Yard ; she said , she wanted something lower ; I told her , there was but one Sort lower ; she said , she wanted something of a Groat a Yard ; I said , there was nothing of double the Price ; she said , she had a Coat of that Price on , which she bought of John Brown , an old Cloaths-Man ; and that some of her Acquaintance had bought some ; she took me to the Monument-Alehouse in East-Cheap , where there were three Women who had bought Flannel , which I had Reason to believe were my Goods : I went with Mrs Harris to Mr James 's , who keeps the White-Lion-Alehouse the lower End of Rag-Fair , to seek after this Brown : Says Mrs Harris , There is Brown sitting at the Table , and informed me that Mr James was a Constable : I spoke to Brown , and charged him with having sold Flannel at an under Rate , which I believed to be mine ; he flew in a violent Passion , and said , he did not value what I could do ; said I , Mr Constable , take hold of him : I saw a Door a little open , I went in , and upon the Bed were 4 Remnants of Flannel with my Mark upon them , which might contain , to the best of my Judgment , about 20 Yards each ; said I to Mr James , the Constable , These are mine . Brown said they were his ; said I , Mr Constable , I insist upon it , that you take Care of them and the Prisoner ; Mr James was not very ready to take Charge of Brown ; then I resolved to have him before my Lord-Mayor ; I said , I would go and smoak a Pipe till my Lord-Mayor was at Leisure ; and we went to the White-Lion-Tavern , in White-Chapel ; while we were there , said I to John Brown , you had these Flannels somewhere ; if you came honestly by them , you will tell me where you had them ; and if you are an honest Man , you will give me an honest Answer . Said I , Pray how came you by these Goods ? I will tell you plainly these are my Goods ; he gave me for Answer , D - n me , and a good deal of that Language , and said it was no Business of mine ; and he would go to Jail rather than make a Discovery ; then , said I , you shall go to Jail ; for these Things have been pretty frequently practised in our Neighbourhood , and I am resolved to find out the Bottom of it . Then he said , Damn you , Sir , I had these from Dublin . Now I knew where the Flannels chiefly came from , and that there are very few which come from thence . When he was examined before my Lord-Mayor , he said he had them from one Brown , a Correspondent of his in Lancashirt , but my Lord threatening to commit him , he said , My Lord , if you will not commit me to Jail , I will tell you the Truth ; then he said he had them at a Court in Threadneedle-street , of the Gentleman 's Servant . - He owned he had them of my Servant , the other Prisoner ; who , being sensible of his Guilt , confessed the Fact with Tears . He owned he had taken , at different Times , about eleven or twelve Pieces , which he had sold to this Brown ; he said he sold them for 15 Shillings a Piece , two of them were worth 12 or 13 d. per Yard ; and two of them about Eight-pence half-penny per Yard ; the lowest priced Flannel we have is Eight-pence half-penny per Yard . The Prisoner had been my Servant about five Years ; he was a Sort of a Porter to carry out Goods for me . Q . Did he never sell any Goods for you ? Staples . I do not deny that he used to sell Goods for me sometimes when I was out of the Way . Samuel James . On the 3d of March Mr Staples came to my House with a Warrant , and he knows very well I told him I had bought that Flannel of Brown , and I showed him where it was . Q . What Price did you use to give him for them ? Samuel James . I gave him different Prices , sometimes Six-pence , and sometimes Seven-pence or Seven-pence half-penny , never less than Six-pence ; some of it was damaged , and not worth above a Groat a Yard . I believe I have bought to the Value of ten Pounds of him , and never got above two Shillings in the Pound by any Thing that I bought of him . - This Gentleman says in his Evidence , that I was loth to take Charge of Brown ; but he is mistaken in that Part of his Evidence ; for I never refused to take Charge of him . The Gentleman went to the White-Lion Tavern in White-Chapel , and called for a Bottle of Wine ; says Brown , Do you charge me with stealing these Goods ? And Mr Staples said , If you did not steal them , you might have them of some Body that did . I said , as for my Part , I buy Goods of any Body that comes to my House ; and you said your Man had sold several thousand Pounds worth of Goods for you . Mr Staples . I said he had sold Goods for me when I was out of Town , or not in the Way . Samuel James . You did not say any thing of that . Q . Did not Brown say he had these Goods from Ireland ? James . Yes , he did , but there was no Mention made of any particular Parcel of Goods . Q . Did not he say he had them out of Lancashire ? James . Yes , he said he had some , or one Piece out of Lancashire . Q . Did he own he had them at Mr Staples 's ? James . He said at last he had them at a Warehouse in Threadneedle-street . Q . Have these been all the while in your Custody ? Mr James produced the Flannels , and said they had not been all the while in his Custody , but believed them to be the Goods he bought of John Brown ; and Mr Staples proved them to be his Goods . The Evidence not being sufficient to fix a Felony upon the Principal , they were both acquitted . 201.

Whose Property do you take them to be ? Lyddall . I apprehend them to be my Property , as I am Executor , on Behalf of the Legatees . I got a Search-Warrant , and had the Prisoner apprehended . John Johnson . The Handkerchief and Ring are my own . - I bought the Ring with my own Money , the other Things were to be divided . The Prisoner pretended to be a Coachman . I have seen him at several Publick-Houses . He seemed to be destitute of a Lodging , and said he should be glad if I would take him in . I have known him twelve Months , and he used to appear like a Gentleman . I gave the Ring to Mary Wishart to lock up ; and it was locked up in the Chest of Drawers in the Bed-Chamber . He had laid in the House eight Nights before I missed the Ring . I lost the Handkerchief about two Days before . I charged him with it , and he said at first , he supposed I had it picked out of my Pocket . I left my Ring in one of the Drawers unlocked . I found my Ring and Handkerchief upon him about ten o'Clock in the Evening , the same Night that I missed them . What will you do with me now , said the Prisoner , I will give you this Spoon which I have changed at the Silver-Smith 's . - He would have given me two new Spoons and my Ring to make it up with me , but I would not do it ; for he had changed with the Silver-Smith , and given him seven Shillings . This Spoon is one of them which was lost , and found by the Direction of the Prisoner . He confessed the taking of them ; he had the Handkerchief about his Neck , and the Justice ordered me to take it off . - I found the Spoon by his Direction at a Goldsmith 's , and then he confessed the taking of them . Mary Wishart . I saw the Prisoner with the Handkerchief about his Neck , said I , How did you come by that Handkerchief ? Said he , of the Maid Jenny ; I said it was not his Handkerchief ; and ( I will not tell any Lye to be sure ) says the Prisoner , If the Handkerchief is lost , some Body has picked it out of your Pocket . There were five Tea-Spoons , only I left him one of the Spoons to use ; the Tea-Spoons , the Tea-Tongs , and Gold Ring , were locked up in a Drawer , and when I missed them , I could not speak for a Quarter of an Hour . I called Johnson , and told him the Drawer had been broken open , and that I believed the Prisoner had done it , and Johnson took him that Night ; said the Prisoner , Mary , I am informed you have lost your Tea-Spoons ; said I , so I have , and I believe you have got them ; said he , G - d d - n you , you B - h , what do you mean by that , Madam ? Said I , you Rogue you have them . I saw the Handkerchief and Ring taken from him before the Justice , and he owned the Fact . John Hastings . I am a Goldsmith ; the Prisoner came to my Shop , and brought these Tea-Spoons , a large Spoon , and a Pair of Tea-Tongs , about a Fortnight or better ago , and he gave me seven Shillings and Three-pence difference , between his old Plate and my new Spoons . Says he , If my Wife should not like these Spoons , you will change them ? I told him I would . These are the Spoons I had from him , which were owned by Mrs Wishart . Prisoner . Mr Johnson and I lodged at a Publick-House , and he said to me , Mr Birch , you are out of Place , you may lie here ; but we had a few Words which occasioned a Difference ; says he , As you want a little Money , there are some Things which are left between Molly and me ; you may take them , and make use of these Spoons , but do not sell them out-right ; and I sold them out-right without his Consent , and he charges me with stealing of them . Johnson being asked whether he gave the Prisoner any leave to make use of them , said , that he never in his Life gave him any Leave to use , or exchange , or put them into his Custody , upon any Account whatsoever .

Piece , 2 Guineas , and 41 Shillings in Silver ; I asked them , Whether that was all ; they said , Yes , there is all : Said I , Mrs Bates says you have taken more ; they said , there was no more : Said I , Be ingennous , do do not conceal any Thing , it will be the worse for you if you do : They said , there was no more Money ; I asked for the Linnen , and they said it was given to a Woman to wash ; I went to the Woman for it , and she delivered it ; it was in a miserable nasty Pickle ; it is not fit to be seen in Court ; said I , You took it away clean , how came it in this Condition ? They said , they had the Misfortune to let it fall in a Ditch ; I asked them , how they came at the Money ; Ellard said , she did not know how Cannon came by it ; and that she brought it to her . I have known Ellard a great while , and did not think but that she had been very honest . Q . Who gave you the Money ? Sanders . Ellard gave me the Money - I think they were fuddled . Q . What was the Washerwoman they gave the Linnen to ? Sanders . I do not know her , - she is not here . Q . Where had you this Linnen ? Sanders .

William Thomson , Headborough . Mr Sanders came to me on Sunday , and told me of a Robbery that was committed on a poor old Woman of his Acquaintance , and desired I would go along with him to endeavour to find out the Thieves ; I went with him to the Sign of the Black-Bull , at Tottenham-high-Cross ; we made what Haste we could for Fear they should be gone ; and when we came there , made what Haste we could up Stairs , and found them both in Bed , and desired they would return the Money which they had taken from Mrs Bates , and without any Hesitation at all they returned the Money , as related by the former Witness ; I was with them several Times afterwards , and they did not deny it : I asked the little one ( Cannon ) how it came into her Head ; she said , It came into her Head as it did into other People 's Heads , and that she had a Design to do it some Time before she committed the Fact .

He said he had good Luck , that he found it by Hyde-Park-Corner , and wanted to sell it .

It happened some Time afterwards that I wanted some Money , and I carried it to Mr Price , to borrow something upon it ; and he said this Spoon is stole .

How long has he used the Crest ? Dilk . Ever since he set up his Coach , which is 14 Years . Q. to the Prisoner . How long is it since you lived in the Family ? Prisoner .

Henry Gyles I live in the House with Mr Philpot ; I am a single Man , and lie in the Shop for Conveniency ; about Two o'Clock in the Morning , on the fourth of last March , as I lay in Bed , I heard somebody knock at the Door , and presently I heard somebody come padding down Stairs , which I took to be a Man , and then I heard a Whispering and a rustling as I apprehended of a Woman 's Cloaths , and I heard him go up Stairs again , and I thought , she had gone up too ; presently I heard something squeak , which I thought at first to be a Dog , and then I heard the crying of an Infant several Times : I wondered what could be the Reason of it ; this was in the Entry , and very soon after , I heard the Child cry at a greater Distance ; I could not tell whether it was above , or below , at first ; but afterwards , I found it was in the Cellar ; I wondered what she should do there , thinks I , she may take it into the Cellar to quiet it , because she will not distrub the Family ; by and by I smelt a prodigious Stench from the Excrement , and I did not get up , because I thought , if the Child was in the House of Office , I could not fetch it to Life ; some time afterwards ; I heard a Woman go up Stairs and draw Water , come down Stairs , and go up again : I was afraid to go out , to see what was the Matter , being a naked Man , for I had no Weapon to defend myself , and did not know , who might be there : About Five o'Clock , I could just discern it Light , and then I went to Mr James 's , a Cooper , and told him the Affair , and he came with me , and we searched the Necessary-House , with a long Staff with some Nails at the End of it : I advised her Father of it , and he said , he knew nothing of a Child , for he knew nothing of her Lying in ; but he was very willing if there was such a Thing , that it should be brought to a clear Light , and told me , he would enquire into it ; which accordingly he did , and she absolutely denied it ; he acquainted me with what had passed between them , and he went out about some Business ; she sent for me up Stairs , and began to be very robust with me , for aspersing her Character , and said , that she wondered what I meant by it , and the like ; and was in a violent Passion with me : I said , I would have the Necessary-House searched , and would not go to sleep till it was done . I went for a Night-Man ; I think it was on the Friday , the first Step he took , he moved a Plank which I had moved before , and found nothing there at the first View ; then he viewed the Seat of the Necessary-House , and put down a long Fork , or Thing with Prongs , and brought up the Body of an Infant ; her Father was with me , when the Child was brought up , out of the Necessary-House . Q . What Age did the Child appear to be of ? Gyles . Those who are Judges took it to be about three Months old ; Robert Hobbins is the Night-Man , who took the Child up . Q . Where does the Prisoner live ? Gyles . In the House with her Father . Court . You say , when you were in Bed , you heard a Person come padding down Stairs ; Who was that ? Gyles . That was the Journeyman , who let her in . Q . Did he ever own any Thing to you , of her bringing in a Child ? Gyles . No , quite the contrary : - The Child was pulled up by its Cloaths . Q . How did the Child appear ? Gyles . The Surgeon declared , there were Eleven punctured Wounds in the Head ; I did not see the Wounds ; the old Gentleman being with me , and in an Agony of Tears , I can not say , but it moved me prodigiously , that I did not look at the Child , when I heard the Nightman say he had got it . Prisoner . You say , Mr Gyles , you did not know I was with Child , when you knew very well I was with Child , and you are the Person that got the Child . Gyles . This is an Accusation entirely false ; but however , it is impossible that it can do you any Service ; I have spoke the Truth , and nothing but the Truth ; if you could lay it to me , Why did not you lay it to me ? [ Mr Alderman Marshall said that he knew Mr Gyles , that he had an opportunity of knowing his Character ; that he was an honest , sober Fellow , and always behaved well . ] Gyles . The Accusation is entirely false ; she always denied she was with Child , and People have laughed at her for denying it ; when she has gone to Market , the Butchers have said , she should have Things cheaper than another , because she was with Child , and she always said it was Fat . Edward Sherrard . The 4th of March , between One and Two in the Morning , Sarah Wilmshurst knocked at the Door , I came down Stairs , and let her in , and then I went up Stairs , and the Prisoner followed me , and I went to Bed . Q . Had she any Child with her , or any Bundle ? Sherrard . I saw no Child , nor no Bundle , that she had . Q . Had you ever a Candle ? Sherrard . I had no Candle ; - there was a Man at the Door , with a Candle and Lanthorn . Q . Was there any Body along with her ? Sherrard . I did not see any Body . I open 'd the Door a-jar , let her in , fastened the Door again , and then went up Stairs , and the Prisoner said she would follow me , and she came up Stairs directly . Q . Did not you strike a Light ? Sherrard . Yes , I did , and the Prisoner fetched the Light away . Q . Upon your Oath , did not you see a Child she had ? Sherrard . Upon my Oath , she had no Child . Q . When she came to fetch this Light , did not you see a Bundle she had ? Sherrard . She had no Bundle . Elizabeth Wade . I was in Bed , when the Prisoner came to the Door , and I heard a Man-Servant in the House , go down and let her in , and the Door was shut ; he returned up to his Room , and in a little Time after , came down again , and he did not stay long before he went up again , and a little while afterwards I heard the Prisoner come up . Q . Did not you hear a Child cry ? Wade . Yes . Q . Where did you hear the Child cry ? Wade . In the Inside of the House . Q . How do you know it was the Prisoner that went up Stairs ? Wade . I am pretty sure it was her - I heard a Woman come up . Q . How do you know that Woman was the Prisoner ? Wade . I do not know that there was any Body else in the House . Q . Where did she go after she went up Stairs ? Wade . She went into Sherrard 's Room . Q . Did you think it was her because of her going into Sherrard 's Room ? Wade . I do not know any Thing of that . Q . Did she appear to be with Child ? Wade . I took her to be so , but her Mother told me she was not ; and she used stiffly to deny it ; I enquired in the Morning who came in with a Child , and I did not hear any Thing of it till the Afternoon . Q . What did not you hear till the Afternoon ? Wade . I did not hear till the Afternoon who brought in the Child . Court . I think you said you heard the Prisoner come up . Wade . Yes I did , but I did not think there was Murder in hand . Jury . Where was Sherrard when you heard the Child cry ? Wade . He went up Stairs as soon as he let her in ; I heard the Child cry by that Time he got into his Room ; but I did not make any Observation of it , not thinking what was in Hand . Jury to Sherrard . Did not you hear the Child cry ? Sherrard . No , I did not hear the Child cry . Court . Is there any Body that knows of this Woman 's being with Child ? Mary Belfour . I saw her at the House where she lay in , and then she was big with Child . Q . How long was that before the Child was brought to you ? Belfour . The Prisoner had the Case of it the Month she lay-in , and then she left it with the good Woman , where she lay-in , ( with Mrs Kendry ) and I believe it might be there about three Weeks , or a Month more before I had it . Jury . Did she own the Child to be her 's Belfour . Yes , she did , and I am very positive it was her Child ; I used to go frequently and see the Prisoner , and her Child , at that Person 's House . Robert Hobbins . ( Nightman ) I was sent for by Mr Gyles , to search the Vault for a Child ; and when I came there , I found a Board had been taken up , and I could see nothing there ; I called for a Piece of Candle and a Bit of Clay and put it down the Seat of the Vault , and saw something lie three or four Inches above the Soil , like a Bundle , and I took a Drag , with three Tynes , ( it was about three Foot from the Top of the Seat ) I took hold of it with my Drag and put my Right-Hand down and brought it up with my Hand : Says I , Here is the Child ; says I , I will see whether it be a Boy or a Girl ; I took out a Pin and undid the Clout and found it to be a Girl , and the Child 's Feet or Legs were not at all wet ; I saw some Blood just by the Side of the Temple , notwithstanding the Soil that was upon it - the Blood appeared thro ' the Soil . Q Did you see any other Wounds upon the Child ? Hobbins . There 's a Gentleman can give a better Account of that than I can . Prisoner . What did you take the Child up by ? Hobbins . I took it up with a three-Tyned-Drag which took hold of the Cloaths . Prisoner . Was there no Iron at the End of it ? Hobbins . Yes . Prisoner . Perhaps the Child might receive a great deal of Prejudice from that ? Hobbins . No it could not , I did not touch any Thing but the Cloaths with it . Mr Springate I am an Apothecary . I was present with the Surgeon when he examined the Body , and I found eleven punctured Wounds , which I apprehend were done either with a Pair of Scissars or the Point of a Knife , but none of them had entered the Skull , and it was our Opinion that none of them were the Occasion of the Child 's Death ; the Wounds were on the Side of the Head , and one of them was a little above the Right-Eye . The Prisoner 's Defence . About seven o'Clock in the Evening , the third of March , I went to fetch my Child from that Woman 's , ( Mrs Belfour ) who had it to nurse , and I believe I staid till about eleven o'Clock , and I was not to come Home till twelve , because Mr Gyles said by that Time every Body would be in Bed , and he would let me in as he has several Times ; I used to give a Knock with my Knuckles under the Window , and that was to give him Notice that it was me , and he has let me in many a Time ; this is true , and I could assert it if it was the last Word I had to speak . I went into a House to get a Pint of Drink , in order to pass away the Time , and I had not been in the House above two or three Minutes , before a Man came with a Constable , and used me as if they had a Suspicion , that I had a Design to drop the Child ; and there were some People dogged me , but I did not know that then ; and they said I must go to the Watch-house , I did not make many Words , but went to the Watch-house , which I believe was between one and two o'Clock , and then the Child began to be uneasy . I said I had no Money ( for I knew I had paid the Nurse one Week 's Money that Night , and had but three half-pence in my Pocket ) says I , if any of these Men will be so kind as to see me Home , I will satisfy them for their Trouble ; but they abused me , and made use of a great many bad Expressions , and said I had a Mind to make away with the Child ; I said I had no Thoughts of making away with the Child , for all the World knew me to be a tender Mother ; and one of the Watchmen gave me such a shove , that I fell down with the Child in my Arms . Said I , Pray do not go to kill me nor the Child neither , for you shall see I will satisfy you ; and he took hold of my Arm , and shoved me down again ; at the End of Mincing-Lane , and the Marks of the Fall were seen when I was in the Compter ; and the Child fell out of my Lap ; the Child cried , and the Watchman d - d me for a B - h ; and he knocked at the Door twice , before any Body came to open the Door , then Edward Sherrard came down and let me in ; I turned my Back towards him , because he should not see the Child ; for I was not willing he should see it , and Henry Gyles took the Child from me , as I hope to be saved , and took it into his Room . - Henry Gyles , as soon as the Door was open said , You have a Mind to ruin me . Did not I give you a Pint of Victuals of the Child 's , and was not the Child to be in your Room all Night ? Gyles . No , there is no Truth in it , I did not see the Child . Prisoner . How can you say so , when you know you took the Child into your Room . Q . What did Gyles say when you came in . Prisoner . Gyles said to me , G - d d - n you , you have a Mind to ruin me ; so I went up Stairs , and Sherrard gave me a Bit of Candle , and I laid down on the Bed , and fell asleep . Q . What became of the Child ? Prisoner . I left the Child with Henry Gyles . In the Morning about six o'Clock , I heard the Shops opening , and his Shop was opening , and he did not use to open so very early . - This was before six in the Morning ; I enquired after Mr Gyles , and the Man told me he was gone to the Keys to take a Walk . I did not know but he might be gone to get a Nurse for the Child , for he was to have provided a Nurse for it , and that was the Reason of my taking it from that Woman , and the Child was to go down into Wales ; Pray did not I tell you so , Mrs Belfour ? Mrs Belfour . Yes , you did say so to be sure . Prisoner . I used to get the Money of him for the Child , and always paid her for the Child , for it was always a Pleasure to me to take Care of what was born of my Body . Mrs Belfour . Indeed you always paid me very justly . Prisoner . I took the Child away from the other Nurse , because it was almost starved . Q . You spoke of the Child 's going down to a Person in Wales ; What was the Reason of that ? Prisoner . Mr Gyles bid me say so . I got the Money form Mr Gyles , and I used to make and mend , and wash his Linnen ; I had nothing else to provide for , being in a good Father 's House . - After I had given Gyles the Child , I went up Stairs and fell asleep ; but I was to have been in his Room all Night , and to have gone out with the Child the next Morning . In the Morning about eleven o'Clock , my Father told me there was a fine Story raised of me ; that I had made away with my Child . Said he , I did not know you had a Child ; says he , Mr Gyles tells me you had a Child which you brought in last Night , and that you put it down the House of Office . I said to my Father , he can not say that to my Face surely ; says my Father , If you know yourself to be innocent , you must clear up the Point . I said I will very readily do that . I believe my Father did not know I had a Child , nor none of the Family , except my Mother , and to be sure she did . Says my Father to Mr Gyles , Sure this Thing can not be true , you will not be so base as to say so ? Yes , says he , I will , and I will take my Oath of it upon twenty Bibles . My Father said , if such a Thing was done , it would be better for me to go out of the Way ; and if I had done it , if I had not known myself innocent , I would have gone . No , said I , I am innocent of the Thing , and therefore I will not go away . My Lord , I I will tell you this one Thing farther , if you please to give me Leave : Henry Gyles said to me , If I would say that Edward Sherrard put the Child into the Vault , he would give me five Guineas : No , I said , I will not , he is innocent of the Fact , and I would not do it for all the World : Gyles doubted very much whether I would pay the Woman the Money ; and he thought the Child could be nursed at two Shillings a Week , and this Woman had three . I can call a great many to my Character to shew that I was always an indulgent Mother ; I have had ten Children , and no Body can say but that I always used them tenderly - I have a Husband , but I have not seen him these two Years ; I was unhappily with Child by this Man , and no Body knew it but my Mother , and Henry Gyles and that Woman ( meaning Mrs Belfour . ) Court to Gyles . This Woman says , you took this Child from her when she came in . Henry Gyles . Yes , I hear what she says . Court . Was it so or no ? Henry Gyles . No , my Lord , I never rose out of my Bed till I smelt the Stench . Court . She says you are the Father of the Child , what do you say to that ? Henry Gyles . My Lord , I know nothing of it ; I do , upon my Oath , declare , that she never told me a Word of her being with Child , and I knew nothing of her having a Child living till I heard the Child cry in the Entry , I declare it solemnly . Prisoner . Did you never lie with me ? Henry Gyles . No , I never did ; she has used Means to induce me to do it , but I solemnly declare I never did . Elizabeth Hatfield . I have laid the Prisoner of five Children , but I did not lay her of this Child . Prisoner . Mr Gyles advised me to keep it a Secret , and so I sent to a Person who did not know me . Mrs Hatfield . The last Child I laid her of was about two Years ago , at her Father 's , and she said , that was her Husband 's Child . - I never apprehended that she ever shewed any Cruelty to any Child . Jane Philpot . I have known the Prisoner nine Years , and know her to be a tender Mother ; she nursed me with one Child , and used me and my Baby very tenderly . Mary Tolley . I have known the Prisoner fifteen Years , and always knew her to be a very indulgent Mother , and all her Family are very honest People . Elizabeth Whiting . I have know her between five and six Years , and always knew her to be a very tender Mother Luke Philpot . I come to speak in Contradiction to what has been said , with Respect to Mr Gyles 's Character ; and I do know that Mr Gyles has attempted to get to Bed to a young Woman , a Servant of my Father 's , since this unhappy Affair happened ; this is true , notwithstanding Mr Gyles 's great Virtue . Mary Dorrel . I have known the Prisoner between eight and nine Years ; she has been a tender Mother to all her Children . Luke Philpot . There are several more Witneses , but they can say no more than what has been said already , that she has always been a tender Mother , and that I know she has been . Guilty , Death . 225 . + Mary Thomas , Wife of Rice Thomas , of St Mary Whitechapel , was indicted for privately stealing one Linnen-Purse , val . 1 d. and 5 l. 14 s. and 6 d. in Money , the Money of David Thomas , from the Person of Elizabeth , Wife of David Thomas , April 4 .

My Wife lost the Money out of her Pocket ; I stood just by her at that Time . - I saw the Prisoner put her Hand into my Wife 's Pocket , and take the Money out and run in Doors - out of Doors . Q Where was this done ? David Thomas . It was at the Prisoner 's House , my Wife is her own Sister-in-law - they had some falling out before the same Day , and I go to that House to make it away - to make it up ; and the Prisoner put her Hand round my Wife 's Middle and so took it out of her Pocket ; my Wife missed her Money and said , she had taken it ; the Prisoner say to my Wife , I do not take your Money . Q . What Countryman are you ? David Thomas . I am a Welshman - I can not tell what she did with the Money , she went to the Door with it , and the Prisoner came back again presently - in about a Quarter of an Hour - I had not the Money again - I do not know who got it , the Prisoner got it from my Wife . Q . Did she put her Hand into her Pocket in a publick or a private Manner ? David Thomas . She put her Hand in her Pocket , and I saw her do it . Q . You do not know whether your Wife had the Money again or no ? David Thomas . I do not know indeed . Prisoner . He carried his Wife drunk home in his Arms . Ask him whether the Money might not be gone another Way : If I tell a Lye contradict me . Q . Was your Wife drunk , and did you carry her home in your Arms ? David Thomas . No , Sir ; I do no carry my Wife in my Arms - The Prisoner desired me to go to her House , there was some Difference with my Wife , and I went to make Friendship again . Elizabeth Thomas . My Husband and I had some Words , and she came to make it up , and she put her Hand round my Middle , and when I put my Hand in my Pocket I missed my Money , and I said , Lord ! all my Money is gone . If you have lost your Money , said the Prisoner , I will look for it . Said I , How can you look for it when you have it . - She took it out of my Pocket . Q . How did you come by this Money ? Elizabeth Thomas . By hard working and Industry - there was 5 l. 14 s. and 6 d. when she had taken it , she went out of the House , and in a little Time came back again ; and then I told her she had got my Money : I could not tell whether she took it in Jest or good Earnest . Q . Were you sober then , or were you in Liquor ? Elizabeth Thomas . We were both sober then , and I am sure I had the Money when I went into the House ; I would not tell a Lye , for I hope my Soul is better to me than all the Money in the World . Q . What Reason had you to think she had the Money ? Elizabeth Thomas . I had Occasion to pay some Money about a Quarter of an Hour before , and I am sure I had it then - when I missed it I said , All my Money is gone , I have not a Farthing in the World to buy Bread for my Child . Q . To David Thomas . Did you see the Linnen Purse , in the Prisoner 's Hand ? David Thomas . I did not see the Purse in her Hand , and please your Honour ; I saw her put her Hand in her Pocket , that is all . Q . How came you not to stop her ? David Thomas . I did not think she would have kept it ; my own Brother was in the House then : - My own Brother is Husband to the Prisoner . Q . Did she go out immediately , after she took the Money out of your Pocket ? Elizabeth Thomas . She run out of the House directly ; - she might stay about a Quarter of an Hour , before she returned : I lost my Money on Easter Monday , at Night . Ann Simpson . I was with the Prisoner , on Easter Monday , from Seven o'Clock in the Morning , till Twelve at Night , at the Cherry-Tree ; there had been a Quarrel , and David Thomas 's Wife had bound these People over , and I was afraid the Prisoner would have had hard usage : Elizabeth Thomas , said to the Prisoner , Come , Sister , we must be Friends , in spight of all the Devils in Hell . - This Elizabeth Thomas had run Nine-pence Halfpenny in the Gentlewoman 's Debt ; she was in Liquor , and she said she would go home ; the Prisoner said , Betty , you shall not go home ; but she did go home , and came back again , and the Prisoner carried her home from the Cherry-Tree , to the Prisoner 's own House , and after we had been some Time at the Prisoner 's House , she gave each of us a Dram of Gin , and a Quarter of an Hour before Twelve , we came out , and left the Prisoner in her own House , we all came home together ; I had been in Bed above a Quarter of an Hour before Elizabeth Thomas came home ; Lord , Simpson , says she , I have lost my Money ; my Sister took it out of my Pocket ; said David Thomas , Now , between you and your own Conscience , do you think , your Sister-in-Law has your Money ; and she said , I can not say so ; and David Thomas said , My Wife can not swear it : - I do not know whether the Prisoner was at David Thomas 's House , I never was out of her Company , and Elizabeth Thomas might as well have sworn it to me , as any other Person . John Stone . I am a Lodger in Rice Thomas 's House , and I heard no Manner of Disturbance that Night : - It was in Rice Thomas 's House , that this Thing was done , and not in the House of David Thomas , the Prosecutor . Joseph Lawrence . I keep a Publick House , just by Rice Thomas , they keep a Chandler's-Shop ; they are very honest People . A Witness .

The Case , as laid in the Indictment , was , that Winifred Jackson , having four East-India Bonds in her Custody , viz . No . 11453 , dated September 30 , 1708 . A . No . 12179. dated June 22 , 1711 . A . No . 15106 , dated July 22 , 1712 . A . No . 16388 , dated November 16 , 1713 . And the East-India Company having given due and publick Notice in the London-Gazette , on the 21st of June 1729 , for the Payment and Discharge of the 1st of the said Bonds , that Bond ceased to carry any further Interest , from and after the 31st of December then next ensuing : And the said Company having given the like Notice on the 16th of May 1730 , for the Payment and Discharge of the other three Bonds , those also ceased to carry any further Interest from and after the 31st of December then next ensuing : And that on the 1st of January 1730 , and from thence continually to the 4th Day of March aforesaid , there remained due and payable , from the said Company , over and above the principal Sums of 100 l. on each of the said Bonds , no more than the Sum of 96 l. for Interest , on Account of all the said four Bonds : And they , the said Winifred Jackson , & c. did falsly , fraudulently , unlawfully and deceitfully declare , affirm , and assert , to the said Thomas Sharp , that the Company , notwithstanding such publick Notices , had , upon the Petition of her , the said Winifred Jackson , at a general Court by them holden , ordered , that the said four Bonds should carry Interest to the said 4th Day of March ; and did likewise assert , that there was then due , from the said Company , on Account of the said four Bonds , the full Sum of 665 l. 2 s. And they did falsly and deceitfully persuade and incite the said Thomas Sharp , to pay her , the said Winifred Jackson , the said Sum of 665 l. 2 s. which Sum he , giving Credit and Belief to the aforesaid Declarations , & c. did then and there actually pay , into the proper Hands of the said Winifred , as so much Money due from the said Company , on and for the Purchase of the said Bonds , by Reason and Means whereof , the said Thomas Sharp did then and there pay to the said Winifred 169 l. 2 s. more than was really due : And thereby the said Winifred Jackson , did fall , and obtain from , cheat and defraud the said Thomas Sharp of the Sum of 16 l. 2 s. to the great Deceit , Fraud , and Damage of the said Thomas Sharp , in Contempt of our said Sovereign the King , and his Laws , to the evil Example of all others , & c. The Council for the Prosecutor having opened the Case , were proceeding to call their Witnesses in order to prove it , when it was objected , on the Part of the Defendants , that the first Bond was improperly set forth in the Indictment , it being there laid that the United Company of Merchants of England , trading to the East-Indies , by the Name and Description of the English Company trading to the East-Indies , did in and by one Bond dated the 30th Day of Sept. 1708 , acknowledge , & c. whereas , at the Time the said Bond bore Date , they were not the United Company . To this it was answered , That by the Act , 6 Anne c. 17. they were to assume that Title on the 29th of September 1708 , which was the Day preceeding the Date of the Bond in Question ; provided the Lord Godolphin should by that Time settle his Award between the two Companies . The Council for the Defendants admitted they were so , in Case the Lord Godolphin , then Lord High-Treasurer , ( to whom the two Companies had submitted the settling the Terms of their Union ) should before that Day make his Award in Writing ; but that it was incumbent on the Prosecutor to prove such Award was made ; this he not being prepared to do , could not proceed as to that Bond . The Council would then have gone on to prove the Fraud , in relation to the other three Bonds ; but the Jury not having found the several Sums due , or paid , for the Principal and Interest on each Bond , but one general Sum upon the whole , the Defendants were acquitted . 237 . 238.

I am near thirteen Years of Age ; last Thursday I saw the Prisoner go by our House , between one and two o'Clock , to a Vault belonging to Mr. Burkit at Chelsea , with something under her Petticoat ; about a Quarter of an Hour afterwards , I saw her come back with something in her Lap , but it was not quite so big as it was before ; she had a Stick in her Hand , which was clean when she went , and when she came back it was soiled . I went to the Vault soon after , and saw some Drops of Blood upon the Seat , and I heard something blubber in the Vault . I came Home directly , and told my Mother ; my Mother said some Child had been there and cut their Fingers . Elizabeth Wootton ( the Girl 's Mother , repeated what the Child had told her ) . I went to the Vault myself , and there was a little Blood upon the Seat , and the Soil looked as if it had been disturbed . At Night I told an old Gentlewoman of it , that lives in the House , and the next Morning we searched the Vault , and found something that seemed to be hard and heavy ; I went for a Pair of Tongs , and happened to take hold of a Child 's Arm ; when I saw the Child , I squalled out , and let the Child drop down again into the Vault . The Child was taken out stark naked . I did not perceive any Marks of Violence . - I live next Door but one to the Prisoner , and observed before , that she seemed to be big .

She owned the having the Child , but said she did not kill it , indeed I did not lay violent Hands on it . She said she was in Bed , and had the Belly-ach , and after two Pains , the Child was born ; and her Husband being away from her several Years , she was ashamed of its being discovered , and she laid the Child under the Bed ; and on Thursday Morning , before it was light , she put it into the Vault - She said she did not observe any Body see her do it , and that she went that Thursday with a Stick , because she had seen part of it , and took the Stick to push is down with .

The Prisoner not understanding the English Tongue , Isaac Silver was sworn an Interpreter . Peter Winstanley . On the 1st of this Month , Mr Steere sent his Apprentice , Henry Arnold , with a Draught of 117 l. 13 s. on Messieurs Honeywood and Fuller , which he received , and set down the Particulars ; just as he put it into the Shovel , and held it in his Hand upon the Counter , the Prisoner came into the Shop , with two Spanish Doubloons , as I apprehended , to sell ; I weighed them , and thought the most ready Way , as he did not understand English , was to shew him what I would give him for them , which was six Guineas and six Shillings ; and I laid the Money upon the Counter ; he did not take this Money which I offered him , but went to the other End of the Counter , where the Shovel full of Money was , and took up a handful and separated them ; there were 36 Shilling Pieces , and some Moidores ; I thought he understood that Money better , so I ordered Arnold to give him the Money out of the Shovel ; he said he could not pay him out of that Money , but he gave him three 36 s. and I gave him a Guinea and three Shillings ; still I could not keep his Hand out of the Shovel , he had it in several Times : He pointed to his Knees , as much as to say he wanted a Pair of Knee-Buckles , he had no Buckles to his Knees : I pulled out the Drawer , he took out a Pair , I weighed them , and asked him eight Shillings for them , he said he would give me six Shillings . - He spoke a little broken , but he said six Shillings as plain as I do now ; I said I would take no less than eight Shillings . A neighbouring Goldsmith came by , and gave me a Caution , for he said he had been in his Shop just before , and he suspected him . Just as he was going out of the Shop , he said he would give me seven Shillings , and went away . I took three Thirty-six Shillings , and gave them to Arnold to put into the Shovel . Now , says I , your Money is right , or should be right . I bid him tell it , and asked him if he had not taken any ; he said there were four missing ; he told it twice before I offered to go after him I thought I should light of him about Exchange Alley , but I did not : About an Hour afterwards I lighted of him , in Beavers-Marks , in Dukes-Place , in a Room with five or six more Jews . I took hold of him , and charged him with it ; he seemed frightened , and said , as they told me , if I would be quiet , and make no Disturbance , he would return me the Money . I sent Home for my Master , he brought a Constable , and we had him before my Lord-Mayor . Henry Arnold confirmed every Circumstance of the former Evidence ; and said he received at Mr. Honeywood 's and Comp . 117 l. 13 s. viz . seventy-five Moidores , nine Thirty-six Shillings , and four Shillings , that he told the Money twice immediately after the Prisoner was gone , and missed four Moidores ; that no Body else had been in the Shop ; that the Money was never from him , nor the Shovel out of his Hand . The Prisoner ( by his Interpreter ) said , that he did not care to take Guineas , and only pointed to the Shovel ; that he never touched the Shovel , nor any more Money than they gave him ; that he did not know what they came to him about , till they came before my Lord Mayor ; that he supposed it was a Fraud among the Servants , and so they laid t upon him . Zipporah Silver , Levena Clervert , Jacob Depaz , Jacob Aaron , and Solomon Riatti , gave him the Character of a very honest Man , and have known him about two or three Years , that he is a Merchant , and goes abroad with Goods ; that they have trusted him , and he has paid them very honestly ; that he came from Gibraltar but the Day before this happened .
