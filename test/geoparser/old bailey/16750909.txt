THe late Sessions held at Justice-Hall in the old Bayley , begun on Thursday the 9th . of this instant September , and continued Five whole daies , that is to say , till Tuesday the 17th . of the same month , was as considerable for the number of Malefactors there tryed as any we have known for a long time ; yet in this somwhat happily remarkable , that there was no person convicted of that most hanious and crying sin of murder , of which we have frequent and dreadful examples almost every Sessions , nor any Women at all condemned for any crime whatsoever . One of the first that was arraigned for Fellony and Robbery was a person that was supposed to be a Confederate with those that rob 'd a Gentletleman about Lambs-Conduit , formerly mentioned in the Gazet . The prisoner it seems had been anold acquaintance of the Gentleman that was rob 'd , and had ( as was alledged ) both that day and at several other times importuned him to walk in the fields , but it seems the Gentleman , either through infirmity or mistrust , had of a long time with stood his importunity , but at last over-come by it , he did take a walk with him almost as far as Pancridge Church , till it grew toward the Close of the Evening ; and then seeing two Fellows whom he look 'd upon as suspitious persons , he desired to return homeward , and they did so , both together , and in the field next to Lamb's-Conduit parted , which they had no sooner done , but the Gentleman found himself assaulted very furiously , and handled very roughly by four or five fellows , who bastinado 'd him sufficiently , and took from him Gold , Silver , and Rings , at a considerable value , and so very fairly departed . They were no sooner gone , but his pretended friend came up to him , his hands ty 'd behind him with a Ribbon , and affirmed that he had likewise been rob 'd , and had lost eighteen shillings in money , & c. However the Gentlemen look 'd upon this as nothing out a pretence , and in a short time after caused him to be apprehended , but upon the summing up of the Evidence the honourable Court thought fit to acquit the Prisoner upon condition he found sureties for his better behaviour for the future . The next Arraigned , were three men suspected for Robbing a Gentleman as he was going home in the Evening , in a Lane neer Pancridge-Church , a place it seems noted for such kind of Villanies . The Gentleman was on Horse-back , and in the dusk of the Evening , discovered the head of a fellow behind a Bank as he rode , and presently with one blow he knockt him off his Horse , and two more coming in upon him he was forced to surrender about five pound in Money , a stricking Watch , worth about Ten pound , and several other things of value , for they stript him even of his very shooes , and left him in that condition : wounded very severely , and his Horse turned loose , but he in some short time coming to himself again , made what speed after them he could in that condition , and finding out the Watch , that constantly attends at Pancridge-Church , he made his Complaint to them , who immediately went in pursuit of the Rogues , and in the very next Ground met with Three men on foot , which the Gentleman immediately concluded to be those that had Rob 'd him , as I think any man would have done in his case . But upon their Tryal it was proved that they were honest Labourers , so that no manifest proof coming against them , nor any thing being positively sworn to , they were likewise acquitted . These two instances , though they may not give the Reader that satisfaction he expects , because there is no condemnation or Execution in the case , yet my design in the reciting them is rather to warn all people that they take care how they wander late in the Evening about the out-skirts of the City , than to satisfie the curiosity of such as take delight to see and hear of the tragical ends of those miserable wretches , that are the Authors of such mischief . But for the satisfaction of such we come in the next place to speak of some eight that were Indicted and condemned for Burghhlary , which Word is said to be derived from two old French Terms ; Viz . Burgh signifying an House , and Laron a Theif , of these there were in Number Eight , among which was a young Lad about twelve or thirteen years of age , that broke into house , who was discovered by his Hat , which either for fear or hast he left behind him . There were likewise Indicted , Arraigned , Convicted , and Condemned Five Malefactors for Robing on the High-way , yet such pittiful Ones , as ( if there might be any Glory arise from Illegal Actions ) scarce deserve the Honour to be stiled High-waymen , being of that wretched crew commonly musterd in the Rogues Infantry , and called the Foot-padd ; Their usual practice was to lurk in the Evening , or very early in the Morning , about Islington , and other skirts of the Town , and force what single Passinger they could meet with to surrender their Purses , and sometimes withsudden violence took Contribution of Hats and Cloaks , one of them had the bad ( good ) , luck to meet with a Booty of Thirty and odd pounds , though now he is like to pay dear enough for the Purchase . Another was a Bayliff , who pretended , at least , a Warrant against a person he met , but , as was Sworn , rob 'd him ; Many had the Charity to pitty him , but the jury upon a positive Evidence , could not but find him Guilty , and I must now leave him to the All knowing judgement of God , and the Sentence of the Law , or the Mercy of his Most Gracious Prince . Six persons more were Indicted for smaller Fellonies , and by the Favour of the Jurors brought in Guilty only of Petty Larceny , ( that is , Guilty of Fellony , but under the value of Twelve pence ] and for the same were sentenced to be whipt at the Carts Tail . Lastly , there were two indicted for Cheats , the one coming to a Gentleman s House , and telling him there were two or three persons at such a Tavern would speak with him , and watching his going out , came a while after as from him saying he was at such a place , and was to go over the Water , and desired they would send him his Cloak , which some of his family thereupon delivered tohim ; and he went away with it and pawn 'd it ; the other had abused people with False pretended notes of money : For which they were fined five marks a peice , and ordered to stand three several daies in the Pillory ; and so the Sessions at the present concluded .
