First Indictment . Counsel . My Lords , and you Gentlemen of the the Jury ; this is an Indictment against the Prisoner , R Coyle , for Murder ; the Indictment charges , th Richard Coyle , with John Richardson , Caleb Larson , and John Davison , not having God before their Eyes , & c on the 26th of August , in the Ninth Year of his Majesty 's Reign , being Mariners in the St. John Pink , on Benjamin Hartley , the Master , did make an Assault , on the High Seas , and within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England , and the Indictment sets forth , that John Richardson , did strike the said Hartley several Times on the Top of the Head with an Axe , which he held in his right Hand , by means of which striking , he fell into the Sea and was drowned , and that Richard Coyle , Caleb Larson , and John Davison , were present , aiding , abetting , assisting , and comforting the said Richardson , in the said Murder : We shall call our Witnesses and prove the Charge ; then we doubt not but you 'll find the Prisoner guilty . Counsel . My Lords , and you Gentlemen of the Jury ; the Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted on two Indictments ; the First is , for the Murder of his Captain ; the other is for Piracy . We shall proceed on the Murder first , and not meddle with the Piracy , 'till you have the Evidence on that Head , laid before you . The Case will come out thus , - This Ship , the St. John Pink , belonged to Yarmouth , and one Benjamin Hartley was Master . In January 1733 , this Ship went from Yarmouth to Leghorn , loaden with Herrings ; when she arrived at Leghorn ; she was employed to trade from Port to Port in the Mediterranean . On the 25th of August 1735 the Master of this Ship , departed from Padras in Turkey , loaden with Corn , and bound for Leghorn . The Ships Company was the Prisoner Coyle , Larson , a Dutchman , Richardson the Carpenter , and Davison the Cook ; four Mariners besides the Master . There was also three Apprentices to the Master , then on Board , Philip Wallis , William Durrant , and William Metcalf . The Day after the Ship sailed from Padras , about two in the Morning , the Apprentices Wallis and Durrant , were asleep , or laid down in a Place call 'd the Cable-Teer , a Place , I presume , where the Cables are deposited ; they hearing a Shriek , and a great Noise went up on Deck , and there they saw the Master , in the Fore-shrouds of the Ship , endeavouring to avoid the Danger that threaten 'd him , and begging his Life . I would aggravate a Case of this Nature , but will leave the Captain 's Expressions to come before you from the Witnesses . They had at this Time a Blunderbuss among them , and they endeavoured to shoot him with it , but ( I think ) it missed firing . After this , the Prisoner at the Bar , as we apprehend , took hold of the Captain to throw him over-board into the Sea , but he holding by the Lanniards ( a Part of the Ship which will be explained to you ) the Prisoner took up a Hen-coop Trough , and struck him with it , in order to beat him off , into the Sea , but his Blows had not the wish 'd for Effect . The Captain held fast , and did not fall into the Sea , so another of the Confederates , which we have not yet got , the Carpenter Richardson , he struck him on the Head with an Axe , and his Blows were so effectual , that the Captain fell off , into the Sea and was drowned . The Fact is attended with such aggravated Circumstances of Cruelty , that I must leave the rest , to come from the Witnesses themselves . After they had committed this Murder , they ran away with the Ship , but as this more properly belongs to the Piracy , for which the Prisoner is likewise indicted , I shall only mention the Manner in which they were taken . The Prisoner at the Bar , after the Captain was murdered , took upon him the Command of the Ship , and wanting fresh Provision , about fifteen Days afterwards they came to Foviniano , an Island belonging to the Crown of Spain , and here , tho ' they wanted Provision , yet , being sensible of their Guilt , they were afraid to go on Shore , but sent Messages ashore to and fro in the Night , and one Night while the rest were asleep , the Apprentices , who were not so materially concerned , took an Opportunity of getting ashore , and gave Information to the Magistrates , of the Fact which had been committed : The Crew remaining on board , finding the Boys were gone on Shore , thought it best for them to run away , so they all quitted the Ship , and shifted from Place to Place , till at last the Prisoner was taken at Tunis , and was brought hither . The Matter for your Consideration will lye in a narrow Compass , so I shall take up no more of your Time , but shall only call our Witnesses . Philip Wallis was call 'd and sworn . Counsel . Do you know the St. John Pink ? Wallis . Yes , I belonged to her 5 Years . Counsel . Was you on board this Vessel in Jan. 1733 ? Wallis . Yes , I was the Captain 's Servant . Councel . Was there any other Person in the same Condition with yourself ? Was there any other Servants ? Wallis . There was one William Durrant came a Twelvemonth afterwards , and after that , William Metcalfe ; they were on board in August 1735 . Counsel . Where was the Ship then ? Wallis . The Ship was at Padras when the Murder was committed , and Padras is in the Morea . Counsel . How many Persons were then on board Wallis . There was the Captain and the Prisoner at the Bar , he was Mate , and Richardson the Carpenter , and a Spaniard , and John Davison the Cook , and one Caleb Larson , a Foremast-Man , he was a Dutchman . Counsel . What Time did you sail from Padras ? Wallis . On Monday in the Forenoon ( 't was the 26th of August to the best of my Knowledge , 1735 . ) The Morning of that Day we came out of the Harbour , and that Night between one and two , they began to murder the Captain ; I heard nothing of it till the Captain came up upon Deck , and then I saw the Dutchman Larson , jump down and hand up two Blunderbusses , on of them he gave to the Prisoner , and he ( the Prisoner ) went towards the Captain , who was then upon the Fore-Shrouds , crying out , - dear Mr. Coyle , what are you against me ? Counsel . And what did the Prisoner say ? Wallis . He said , yes , he was , and told the Captain it was a Thing consulted among all the Ship 's Company , and that over-board he must go , and over-board he should go . Counsel . Repeat that again . Wallis . He told the Captain , that over-board he must go , and over-board he should go . After this , the Captain called out to Richardson the Carpenter , - my dear Carpenter , are you against me too ? No Sir , says he , I am not , and immediately he and the Dutchman followed the Captain up the Shrouds into the Fore-top ; the Captain ran up the Shrouds into the Fore-top , and the Dutchman and the Carpenter followed him . Counsel . Had they any Weapons in their Hands ? Wallis . The Carpenter had a a Broad Axe , and the Dutchman had a Blunderbuss . The Captain cry 'd out to them , For Christ 's Sake , - for God Almighty 's Sake spare my Life ! I will hurt none of you , if you 'll spare my Life ! The Dutchman asked him , whether he would forgive him ? and the Capt . said , yes , if you 'll spare my Life , and he put out his Hand to shake Hands with him , but Richardson , who followed the Dutchman , said , G - d d - n you , if you offer to shake Hands with him , I 'll chop your Hands off . Counsel . This was all said while the Captain was on the Fore-top , was it not ? Wallis . Yes ; and he begg 'd there that they would save his Life ; he begg 'd for God Almighty 's Sake that they would spare his Life , and he promised not to hurt any of them , but would forgive them if they 'd but spare his Life . Counsel . Where was the Prisoner at this Time ? Wallis . He was below with a Blunderbuss , and said nothing at all just then : But Richardson told the Dutchman , if he offer 'd to shake Hands with the Captain , he would clive ( cleave ) him down the Head . Then the Captain begg 'd again , that they would remember his Wife and Family , and the Prisoner call 'd out and said , G - d d - n you why do n't you fetch him down ? Why do you stand talking to him ? As we have begun , we must go through with it . After this , the Captain finding they were resolved to kill him , he begg 'd for 4 Hours Liberty , by himself , but Richardson bid him come down , and swore if he did not come down , he would cleave him down . At last he came down by one of the Back Stays , - he slipp 'd down by it ; and as he was sliding down by it , Coyle the Prisoner snapp 'd a Blunderbuss at him , but it miss 'd Fire ; then the Captain jumped down , and got it out of his Hands , and intended to throw it over-board , but it struck against the Fore-sheet , and one of my Fellow-Servants kick 'd it overboard with his Foot : The Captain had not Power to heave the Blunderbuss clear of the Ropes , so it fell down , and my Fellow-Servant kick 'd it into the Sea . Counsel . What follow 'd upon this ? Wallis . Then the Captain got from them to the Fore-mast , and Coyle and the other two got hold of him and flung him over the Gang-way , but he catch 'd hold of the Lanniards of the Main Shrouds , and cry 'd out to us , Boys , Boys , ca n't you do something for me ! We said we could not ; one of my Fellow-Servants got hold of me and said , Let us save the Captain 's Life ; but they said they would knock us down if we offer 'd to stir . Then the Carpenter got hold of an Axe , and knock 'd his Brains out . The Prisoner took up the Chicken Trough to strike him with , but I can not say I saw him strike ; tho ' he was close by when Richardson knock 'd the Captain into the Sea with his broad Axe . Counsel . What did the Prisoner say at this Time ? Wallis . I do n't remember , in particular , what he said . After this , they came to us , and asked us what we cry 'd for ; and they told us , if we would be content , and go with them , they would not hurt a Hair of our Heads . Then Richardson the Carpenter went after the Spaniard , who was all this while at the Helm of the Ship , and he said to him , - d - n you , why did not you come and assist us - The Spaniard 's Name is John Davison ; he told them he was minding the Helm - he was looking after that . Counsel . What did Richardson say to that ? Wallis . He said , - D - n you , and the Ship , you might have let the Ship have gone to Hell , and have come and assisted us . Counsel . Was the Ship under Sail at that Time : Wallis . Yes ; and went after the Rate of two or three Miles an Hour , with a small Breeze of Wind . Counsel . When they had kill 'd the Captain , what follow 'd ? Wallis . After that they went down into the Captain 's Cabbin , and broke open his Scrutore . Counsel . Who did ? Wallis . Richardson broke it open , and what Things they found they put by themselves together : There was no Money on Board : Then they loaded all the Arms in the Ship . Counsel . What did they do that for ? Wallis . Coyle and the Dutchman would have them down to load them , because , they said , they could not tell who they had to trust to . Counsel . After the Death of the Captain , where did you sail to ? Wallis . The first Land we made , afterwards , was the Island of Malta ; but before they went to Land , they made Articles , and Richard Coyle the Prisoner was made Captain ; Richardson went for Mate , and Larson the Dutchman for Boatswain . Then they came to us , and wanted us to sign the Articles , but we were not willing ; so , upon our refusing , they would not go to Land , but Coyle cry 'd out , if they wo n't , - then bear away Boys , we 'll remember them another Time ; we 'll give them nothing but Bread and Water , and serve them worse than the Captain was serv 'd . This he said to me and my Fellow-Servants . Counsel . Where did you go when you left the Coast of Malta ? Wallis . We put into Feviniano . We wanted Water , they said ; but we had Water enough on Board : Indeed they wanted fresh Provision and Liquors . At Feviniano they could get nothing but Water ; so when they came off the Island in the Boat , they let it lie a-stern of the Ship , and the next Night I and my Fellow-Servants , and a Greek , Four of us in all , got into the Boat , and went a-shore . This was about Midnight , when they were all fast asleep . They miss 'd us about an Hour an half after we were gone , and they haul 'd out the Long-Boat , and went off in her from the Ship . The next Morning the Governor sent us aboard again , with 13 Soldiers , but the Prisoner and his Companions had left her , and were gone . Counsel . What became of the Vessel ? Wallis . She was sent to Trepany , where there was an English Consul , and there we perform 'd Quarentine . Counsel . Where about is Foviniano ? Wallis . Foviniano is near Trepany , and that is not far from the Island of Sicily . When our Quarentine was out , I was sent to Leghorn , and from thence to Lisbon , and so to England . I never saw the Prisoner after he left the Ship , 'till I saw him at Lisbon on board the Princess Louisa , in which Ship he was to be brought home . Counsel . Who do you say was made Master ? Wallis . The Prisoner was made Captain ; Richardson the Carpenter went for Mate , and Larson the Dutchman was Boatswain . Q . When the Captain call 'd upon you for Help , what did the Prisoner say to you ? Wallis . I do n't remember what he said to us . Q . When the Prisoner took up the Chicken-Trough , what did he do with it ? Wallis . He was going to knock the Captain on the Head with it . Counsel . You say when the Captain was coming down the Shrouds , the Prisoner snapp 'd a Blunderbuss at him ; was it loaded or not ? Wallis . Yes , it was loaded ; there were three of them loaded , and lay under his Cabbin . Counsel . Did you see the Prisoner attempt to throw the Captain over-board ? Wallis . He lent a Hand , but I did not see him strike him . Counsel . Are you sure the Blunderbuss was loaded ? Wallis . Yes , I saw them loaded two or three Days before . Q . When the Captain was struck from the Lanniards into the Sea , did he sink presently ? Wallis . Yes , he sunk down directly . Prisoner . I would ask that Witness , whether the Captain and I had an angry Word together all the Voyage ? And whether I was not a particular Favourite of the Captain 's . Wallis . The Prisoner had some Words with the Captain a few Days before we came out of the Harbour , at Padras . Prisoner . At Ancona the Captain paid us all our Wages , and he was so kind to me , that he asked me if I wanted Money ; and I told him , I should not have Occasion for any till I came to Leghorn . I acknowledge I snapp 'd the Blunderbuss , but not with a Design to kill him . Counsel . Who loaded the Blunderbuss ? Wallis . The Prisoner loaded every one of them himself . Counsel . Call Richard Durrant . Who was sworn . Durrant . I was on board this Pink in the Year 35 at Padras . Counsel . Who was on board at that Time ? Durrant . The Prisoner , who was the Captain 's Mate , John Richardson the Carpenter , and Larson the Boatswain , and Davison the Cook , and us three Servants , Wallis , Metcalfe , and myself . Counsel . When did you sail from Padras ? Durrant . On a Monday Morning , about Ten o'Clock in the Forenoon . Counsel . What happen 'd after you came from Padras ? Durrant . About Two o'Clock in the Morning , the Captain went to sleep ; Wallis and I lay down in the Cable-Teer . We were 'waked with a Noise , and I asked Wallis what was the Matter ? He said he heard a shrieking upon Deck ; so we ran up to go upon Deck , but I saw Coyle with something in his Hand , and was afraid to venture farther . I saw them running after the Captain , and he was endeavouring to avoid them : upon this , we went upon Deck , and I saw the Captain upon the Fore-top , begging and praying for his Life . There were the Carpenter Richardson , and Larson the Boatswain going up the Shrouds after him , and the Prisoner stood at the Bottom with a Blunderbuss in his Hand . The Captain was some Minutes on the Fore-top , and he called out to shake Hands with them ; but the Carpenter said , by G - d if you offer to shake Hands with him , I 'll cleave you down with the Axe . Counsel . What Words did the Captain use ? Durrant . He begg 'd of them for God Almighty 's Sake to remember his Wife and Family . As he came down , the Prisoner , who stood upon Deck with a Blunderbuss , snapp 'd it at him , but it did not go off . Counsel . What happen 'd afterwards ? Durrant . The Captain haul 'd the Blunderbus out of the Prisoner 's Hand , and threw it , as if he intended to throw it over-board , but it struck against the Tackle and fell into the Ship , and my Fellow-Servant kick 'd it over-board with his Foot . After this , the Captain got to the middle of the Ship , and the Prisoner and all the rest took hold of him , and they hove ( heaved ) him o'ver the rough Tree , but the Captain caught hold of the Lanniards , and held fast ; then the Prisoner took up the chicken Trough and struck him , as he hung , several Blows with it over the Head . Counsel . Are you sure you saw the Prisoner struck him with the chicken Trough ? Durrant . Yes , I did ; and they found that would not do , so the Carpenter with his Axe struck him several Times upon the Head , and then he let go his hold , and dropp 'd over Board and was drown 'd immediately . We expected they would kill us too . Counsel . What did they say to you ? Durrant . They bid us not cry , they would not hurt us , and this , and that - and to'ther . Then they went down into his Cabbin , and looked over his Cloaths , and got all his Papers together , and burnt every one of them . The next Day , they shar 'd his Cloaths , and every one had his Part . The Prisoner had his Part , Richardson and Davison had theirs , and Larson stood upon the Ladder and cry 'd - Who shall have this ? - Who shall have this ? - After this we made the Island of Malta , and they had a Mind to go in there for Provision , but were afraid . Counsel . What happen 'd next ? Durrant . The next Thing they did , was , they went down into the Cabbin and drew a Paper , and they brought it to us to Sign ; we refused , and Richardson told us , if we would not Sign it , we should go the same Way with the Captain : No , says the Prisoner , they shall not go the same Way , we 'll Starve them to Death . After this , they talked of putting in at Malta , but they were afraid , so we made the Island of Mauritimo , for they had Drank all the Wine out , and they wanted to put in somewhere for more , and this was a Place , where they need not perform any Quarentine , so we brought up to an Anchor that Night , and in the Morning , the Prisoner dress 'd himself in the Captain 's Cloths , and was row 'd ashore in the Yawl , by two Hands . We were kept aboard all that Day , and at Night , Larson and Davison were upon Guard upon Deck , one of them with two Pistols , and the other with a drawn Sword , to prevent our getting ashore . After this we came to Feviniano , and one Night finding them asleep , we haul 'd the Yawl to , and my Fellow-Servants got in ; I heaved the Oars over board , and then got in myself ; we row 'd ashore directly and acquainted the Governor ; we desired they would go off directly and take them , but they said they had 'no Orders : That Night we lay on Shore , and next Morning when we went on Board , the Prisoner and the rest of them , were gone off in the Long-Boat . Councel . Was the Blunderbus that the Prisoner snapp 'd at the Captain , loaded , or not ? Durrant . It was loaded ; they were all loaded 3 or 4 Days before ; I ca n't say certainly who loaded them , but I know they were all charged . 2 . When the Carpenter gave him the Blows on the Head with the Axe , which beat him into the Sea , was he drowned ? Durrant . I never saw any Thing of him more ; he sunk down directly . This was at Foviniano . 2 . Did you perform Quarentine there ? Durrant . No , at the Island of Trepany . 2. Who had the Command of the Ship , after the Captain 's Death ? Durrant . The Prisoner . Prisoner . I would ask him , whether I had any Animosity against the Captain ? Durrant . About two Days before we came from Padras , the Captain and he had some Words about a Townsman of his , who was at Padras . The Captain had told your Townsman , you was a drunken Fellow ; he told you again , and you came aboard and rail 'd at the Captain for it . Councel . Call William Metcalf . Who appeared and was sworn . Metcalf . I was on board this Pink in August , 1735 . Councel . Where was the Ship then ? Metcalf . At Padras . Councel . When did you Sail from thence ? Metcalf . On Monday the 26th of August , between 10 and 11 o'Clock . Councel . Who were on Board at that Time ? Metcalf . Richard Coyle , Mate ; John Richardson , Carpenter , one Larson a Mariner , and Davison the Cook , and a Greek and 3 Apprentices ; the Master , Benjamin Hartley , was on Board too . Councel . What do you know more of this Affair ? Metcalf . The next Morning , between one and two , they Murder 'd the Captain . Councel . And where was you ? Metcalf . I was in the Fore-castle ; this was between one and two , on Tuesday Morning . I heard the Captain cry out , and saw him afterwards running upon Deck , and then up the Shrouds , and the Prisoner followed him , with a Blunderbuss in his Hands . The Capt . ran up , upon the fore Shrouds , and into the Topmast , and Larson and Richardson follow 'd him to the Topmast . Councel . What did the Captain say to them ? Metcalf . He begg 'd for God 's sake , - for Christ 's sake , they would spare his Life ; and the Prisoner said ; - Captain Hartley , you must go over-board . Councel . What was done next ? Metcalf . He begg 'd of Larson , and said , Dear Caleb , shake Hands with me , and he reach 'd out his Hand to him ; but Richardson the Carpenter lifted up his Axe , and said , if you do , I 'll clive your Brains out . Then the Captain came down to Leeward , and Coyle snapp 'd the Blunderbus at him . Councel . Did you see him snapp the Blunderbus at him ? Metcalf . Yes ; I stood just by him , and saw it ; when the Captain found the Blunderbus did not go off , he run to him , and snatch 'd it out of his Hands , and threw it from him , and I kick 'd it into the Sea . Councel . Was the Blunderbus loaded ? Metcalf . Yes , they were charged on Account of the Turkish Pyrates on that Coast . After this , they took hold of the Captain . Councel . Who took hold of him ? Metclaf . Larson and Richardson ; and they heav 'd him over the Gang Way , but he caught hold of the Lanniards , and Coyle took up a Hen-coop Trough , and struck him 2 or 3 Blows on the Head and Shoulders ; the Carpenter struck him too over the Head , with his broad Axe , and the last Words he spoke , were , - I am a dead Man , and so he dropt down immediately into the Sea ; I looked over board , and saw him sink directly . We begg 'd the Prisoner to give us the Boat and let us go away , but he would not , and said , What are you afraid of , we wo n't hurt you ; go along with us , if you go away , what shall we do with the Ship ? Councel . Was the Ship under Sail ? Metcalf . Yes , 't was going before the Wind , and we were making the Island of Malta ; and when we lay of the Island , the Prisoner came to me , and asked me my Name ; he said he could not spell it right : Then he went down and Articles were drawn , and he told me I must Sign them . Councel . What were the Articles ? Metcalf . I ca n't certainly tell what was in the Articles ; but Coyle was stiled Captain ; Richardson was to be Mate ; Larson was to be Boatswain , and Davison was to stand as before . Coyle took the Guidance of the Ship upon himself , as Master . Councel . What did they do at Malta ? Metcalf . They intended to go in ; so they made us set our Hands to the Paper ; but after we had Sign 'd it , they were afraid to venture ashore there . Councel . Who were afraid ? Metclaf . Coyle and Larson were afraid to go in ; and Richardson fell a D - ing and Cursing them , because they would not go in . Councel . So you signed the Paper . Metcalf . The Carpenter told us , if we would not sign it , he would send us the same Way with the Captain . No , says the Prisoner , we 'll keep the Ship out at Sea , as long as there 's a bit of Beef , or a Drop of Water on Board , and we 'll starve them ; then we sign 'd the Paper , and as soon as we had done it , the Prisoner and the Carpenter laugh 'd , and said , now we are sure of you . Then we were coming down the Streights , and after we came between the Island of Mauritimo and Cape Bonne , we stood away to the North ward , and bore away for the Island of Foviniano . They talked of going to Trepany , but Coyle said , 't was better to go to Foviniano , because there they were not so strict in their Quarentine . When we came to Foviniano , we let out two Anchors , and the Governor in the Morning sent a Man on Board . The Prisoner dress 'd himself in the Captain 's Cloaths , and he pass 'd for Captain , and we went on shore to sell some Corn , and purchase fresh Provisions ; but they would take no Corn , and we had no Money , so they could get nothing but Water there . We were kept on Board all the Time , that the Prisoner was on shore ; when he return 'd to the Ship , he took the Captain 's Watch and his silver Spoons , to see if the Governor would take them for Provision , and this Time Davison and Richardson and I , went with the Prisoner on shore , and we took some Casks with us and return 'd with Water . Councel . And what happen 'd next ? Metcalf . In the Night , when they were asleep , I went down and called my Fellow-Servants , and the Greek , and we got into the Yaul ; Durrant staid behind to slip the Oars over-board , for we were afraid to throw them into the Boat , for fear they should hear us ; so we lay by , a little while , till the Oars drove to us , and then we row 'd to shore . The Soldiers upon shore , charged us to keep off ; but we begg 'd for God 's sake we might come on shore , and we told them our Captain was Murder 'd : Upon this , they suffer 'd us to land , and put us all into a Cave for that Night . When the Governor examin 'd us , we desir 'd 4 Hands to go on Board the Ship , lest they should cut the Cable , or sink the Ship ; but after he had examin 'd us , he went to his own House , and set 20 or 30 Soldiers over us in the Cave , and they told us they could see the People in the Ship , hauling the Boat a long side of her . We begg 'd them to fire a Musket upon them , but they said , they could not Fire without Orders from the Governor ; but when they got into the Boat , they Fired 20 or 30 Muskets upon them , but they got away ; I saw them go off in the Boat , and never saw any of them since , 'till I saw the Prisoner here . Q . When the Boat went away , who was it that Fired upon them ? Metcalf . The Spanish Soldiers that were upon Shore Q . How many of you went ashore in the Boat ? Metcalf . I and my two Fellow-Servants , and the Greek . Prisoner . I would ask this Witness , whether I ever abused the Captain ? Whether I ever had any Words with him , and whether I was not his Favourite ? Metcalf . No , I do n't know that he abused the Captain all the Time of the Voyage ; the only Time the Captain and he had Words , was at Padras ; but ( I think ) they were Friends together after that . Councel . How long after these Words did the Captain live ? Metcalf . He was kill 'd 2 or 3 Days afterward . The Prisoner 's Defence . I have no one to appear for me , nor any Friend , therefore I hope you will hear me patiently . We sail 'd from Leghorn , March 23d . When we arriv 'd at Messina , we took in Goods and went to a Bay near Syracusa : After that , when we came to Sail , the Captain had some Words with Larson , the Boatswain , about making fast the stopper of the Anchor ; the Boatswain got hold of the Captain , and I turn 'd my self about , and took him ( the Boatswain ) by the Collar , and said , - Caleb , What are you about to do Mischief ? Wallis , one of the Boys said , D - n him , heave him overboard ; but I released the Captain out of the Boatswain 's Hands , and he went upon the Quarter-Deck . I said to Caleb , go after the Captain , and fall upon your Knees and beg his Pardon : Accordingly he did so , and the Captain forgave him : So we proceeded on our Voyage from thence to the Morea , and we landed some Passengers at Salonica ; we were loaded with Tobacco , and were to go from thence to Ancona . I was offer 'd a Ship , but the Captain perswaded me to stay with him ; no better Agreement could be between two People , than between him and me ; nor did I ever Eat or Drink worse than he himself . When we had made this Voyage , the Captain designed to come Home to Falmouth for Pilchards , upon which 2 Greeks we had a Board desired to be Discharged , he paid them their Wages , and ask 'd me if I wanted Money ; I told him , it would be more agreeable to me , on account of my Wife and Family , to take my Money at Leghorn . So the Captain paid the Greeks off and Discharged them , and this Richardson , Larson , and the Spaniard came on board in their stead . We then sail 'd for Padras , with Money on Board , which the Captain had receiv 'd for Freight , and Money receiv 'd at Leghorn . We took in a Cargo at Leghorn , and in the Time of loading there , this was express 'd by these three young Gentlemen ; - there was a fine Sloop come from Venice of 160 Tons , which the Carpenter and these Witnesses , and the Spaniard , and the Greek had agreed to cut away in the Night ; I heard a great deal of their Villany ; - but the Sloop sailing , they were disappointed in their Design . Then , we being loaded sail 'd about 8 o'Clock in the Morning , the 11th of August . They took all my Papers , and suffer 'd me to save nothing , but what I brought upon my Back out of the Ship . In the Night I went to watch from 8 to 12 ; they came to call me , so I went upon the Deck , and there I found the Carpenter , the Boatswain , and the Spaniard , I ca n't say where the Boys were , I believe they might be in the Steerage , but the Carpenter says to me , - Coyle , if you do n't take this broad Axe in your Hand and stand at the Cabbin Door , and if the Captain offers to come up , if you do n't knock him on the Head I will cut you in Pieces . I said , pray do n't do so ; if you make a Word o n't says he , I 'll throw you over-board : So I thought best to take the Axe into my Hand , but when they were gone I threw it down again , and knew nothing of it 'till the Captain came running up upon Deck , and they follow 'd him . I ran round and got upon the Quarter-Deck , then I saw the Captain on the Fore-top , and the Carpenter and the Boatswain on the Fore-yard . The Carpenter was an ill Man , I did not like him , - he had not been aboard a Month , - therefore I had no Commerce with him . But I seeing the Captain on the Fore-top , I jumped into the Steerage , and took up a Blunderbuss ; but I never loaded it , and I believe there had not been a Pistol nor a Blunderbuss loaded for some Time , for we had not a Pound of Powder on Board . I went for the Blunderbuss to shoot the Carpenter , and being very much surpriz 'd , I snapp 'd it , ( but did not know whether 't was loaded or not , ) with a Design to shoot the Carpenter on the Starboard Side of the Quarter Deck . Metcalf and Durrant brought the Captain round , and I thought they were going to heave him over board . They know I have declared these Things before , and that makes them such strong Evidences against me now . I came round with my Blunderbuss , to strike in among them , I do n't know I struck , but it was taken out of my Hands and thrown over board . The Carpenter took the Captain , he struggled , but there was never a Blow struck , nor a Drop of Blood spilt . The Carpenter made a Reach at me with his Axe , and said G - d D - n you , you shall go first , which made me withdraw on the Quarter Deck ; then he fetch 'd the Captain a Blow , but it did not stun him , so he call 'd out to me , Coyle , Coyle , for God 's sake help me ; Lord have Mercy on you , says I , the Men are all against you , and so they hove him over board . Then Wallis went down into the Cabbin , and brought up 2 Case Bottles , a Bottle of Brandy , and a Bottle of Rack , and they propos 'd to make Punch Royal , that is , with Wine in it . Next Morning I said to Wallis what a Piece of Work is this ! D - n him , says he , 'twere no Matter if one half of the People at Yarmouth was serv 'd in the same Manner . Before the Consul of Tunis , he acknowledged himself guilty , and accused every one of them but me . Q . If you apprehended the Blunderbuss was not charged , how came you to take it up , and snap it ? Coyle . I never examin 'd it , - I was in a Surprize . Q . Did you go ashore at Foviniano ? Coyle . Yes , by the Carpenters Orders . I never had a Rag of the Captain 's Cloaths ; the Carpenter took his Cabbin for his own Habitation . If I had had a Mind to have been a Villain , how came I to preserve the Ship and Cargo ; they knew no more of it than you do . When the Water was stor 'd in the Forecastle , I perswaded them to go into Malta , but neither Metcalf , Durrant , nor Wallis would go ; if they were innocent , why should they refuse to go into safe Harbour ? Q . When the Captain was kill 'd , who navigated the Ship ? Coyle . I did , under the Command of the Carpenter . Q . The Witnesses say , you and Richardson and the rest , went away in the Long Boat , what became of you ? Coyle . We went to Tunis in Barbary . In Case these three Witnesses had assisted the Captain , the Thing could not have been done . Q . Have you any Witnesses ? Coyle . No , none but the Boatswain and the Consul of Tunis . Q. Pray why did you leave the Ship ? Coyle . After they went from Foviniano , they differ 'd in their Opinions , and were afraid of one another , so the Boys took the Boat unknown to the other Men and went away ; when the Boatswain found the Boys and the Boat was gone , he call 'd the Carpenter , who lay in the Captain 's Cabbin , and told him the Yaul was gone : I was pleased with it , thinking they would now go away and leave me on Board ; so the Carpenter turn 'd out , and call 'd the Spaniard Davison , and they consulted together , and haul 'd up the Long Boat , and put Masts and Sails into her , and took what Things of mine were on Board , and then the Carpenter came to me with two or three Cutlasses , and haul 'd me on Deck , and said G - d D - n you , get into the Boat ; I heard what they were about , and was in Hopes they would have left me in the Ship , so I said , for God 's sake do n't kill me , and while I was dressing , one of them gave me two or three Blows with the flat side of his Cutlass , and told me , if I would not go he would cut me in Pieces ; then he ordered me into the Boat , and put me to an Oar , and one of them steer 'd ; we row 'd a Mile , and got to Windward of the Island , then they ask 'd me , what Place they might go too where there was no English Consul ; I told them they must go to Tunis or Tripoly : They said they would not go either to Tunis or Tripoly ; so after some few Days , we proceeded to a Place just off Tunis , and there we stopp 'd to shelter our selves , for the Wind blew hard , and we were loaded : Then we proceeded to Byzarta , and landed 15 Leagues to the Westward of Tunis , and the Carpenter before we put in made me swear , that I would be one of his Company , and said I should not stir from him ; he said he would run his Knife thro ' me if I spoke any Thing of this Affair . When he came ashore , he was dress 'd in the Captain 's Cloaths , and appear 'd very grand . He told the People he was born in New-York , and pass 'd an Examination before the Governor , but what he said there I do n't know ; but a Paper was brought us , and we all sign 'd it . After a while we had all Orders to come to Tunis , so we came to Tunis , and there I was confin 'd with the Carpenter , who was Captain for two Days ; at last I discover 'd the Thing , and the Carpenter made his Escape , but was retaken ; the Boatswain turned Turk , and the other turn 'd Jew ; I was kept in Prison there three Months . Q . Where was you taken into Custody ? Coyle . I surrendered to the Vice-Consul of Tunis . Q . What Ship was you put on board there ? Coyle . I was put on board one Captain Darrel . Q . Was you at Large in that Ship ? Coyle . I had small Irons put upon me , but I had my Liberty to walk about the Ship . From Tunis I was carried to Gibraltar , and I was in Custody there two Months ; from Gibralter I was sent to Lisbon , and came Home from thence in the Princess Louisa . Q . And had you Irons on all this while ? Coyle . Yes , but I was at Large . Q . Have you any Witnesses ? Coyle . What Witnesses can I have , since all the Ship 's Crew were concerned ? As for the 3 Witnesses against me , I have often beat them myself for abusing the Captain . 'T is hard I should have such frivolous Witnesses against me , when I have been Master of a Ship myself seventeen Years . I have used the Seas in the King 's and Merchant 's Service this great while , and defy any Person to say , that Black is the White of my Eye . Call Joseph Lyon . Joseph Lyon . The last Time I saw the Prisoner was five or six Years ago . I have known him thirteen or fourteen Years , I never knew any Harm of him , and took him to be an honest Man , nor did I ever hear any one give him a contrary Character . This affair I know nothing of . Richard Manwaring . I have little to say in his Behalf ; I knew him ten Years ago , and have never seen him since ; he was hired and freighted by a Person I had some Concerns with , to carry Goods to Madeira , and he performed that Voyage and had then a good Character ; as for any thing since , I know nothing of him ; he told me himself that he bored Holes in the Ship , on Purpose to have them taken , but how true it is , I can not tell . Another Witness . I have known the Prisoner 27 Years , he was born just by me ; I never heard any Hurt of him ; the last Time I saw him was about 3 or 4 Years ago in Church-Alley , in St. Olave 's Parish . C. Why he was aboard this Pink three Years ago . Witness . It might be four , for ought I know . The Jury withdrew , and in a short Time returned , and found the Prisoners guilty . Death . Edward Johnson , late of London , Mariner ; Nicholas Williams , late of the same Place , Mariner ; LawrenceSenett , late of the same , Mariner ; Nicholas Wolf , late of the same , Mariner ; Pierce Butler , late of the same , Mariner ; and John Bryan , otherwise O'Bryan , late of the same , Mariner ; you stand indicted , for that you , not having God before your Eyes , but being moved and seduced by the Instigation of the Devil , on the 7th of September , in the Tenth Year of his Majesty 's Reign , you , the said Edward Johnson , Nicholas Williams , Lawrence Senett , Nicholas Wolf , Pierce Butler , and John Bryan , otherwise O'Bryan , then being Mariners of , and in a certain Ship , called the Dove Brigantine of which one Benjamin Hawes , a Subject of our Lord the King , was Master , with Force and Arms , on the High Seas , and within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England , about half a League distant from Leghorn in Italy , in Parts beyond the Seas , in and upon the said Benjamin Hawes , then being Master as aforesaid , in the Peace of God , and in the said Ship , feloniously , wilfully , and of your Malice aforethought , did make an Assault , and that you Edward Johnson , with a certain Knife-made of Iron and Steel , which you then and there held in your Right Hand , in and upon the Left Part of the Breast of the said Benjamin Hawes , near the Left Pap , then and there on the High Seas , and within the Jurisdiction aforesaid , feloniously , wilfully , and of your Malice aforethought , did strike and stab , giving to him then and there on the High Seas , and within the Jurisdiction aforesaid , on the Left Part of the Breast , and near the Right Pap as aforesaid , a mortal Wound of the Length of one Inch , and the Depth of three Inches , of which mortal Wound , then and there on the High Seas , and within the Jurisdiction aforesaid , he instantly died . And the Indictment further charges , that you Nicholas Williams , Lawrence Senett , Nicholas Wolf , Pierce Butler , and John Bryan , otherwise O'Bryan , at the Time of committing the said Felony and Murder , feloniously , wilfully , and of your Malice aforethought , were present , aiding , abetting , assisting and comforting the said Edward Johnson , him the said Benjamin to kill and Murder : And so the Indictment says , that you Edward Johnson , Nicholas Williams , Lawrence Senett , Nicholas Wolf , Pierce Butler , and John Bryan , otherwise O'Bryan , him the said Benjamin Hawes , in Manner and Form as aforesaid , feloniously , wilfully , & c. did kill and murder , against the Peace of our Soveraign Lord the King , his Crown and Dignity . [ To this Indictment the Prisoners pleaded , Not guilty . ] On this Indictment the Prisoners have been arraigned , and on their Arraignment have severally pleaded Not guilty ; and for Trial , have put themselves upon God and their Country , whose Country you are . Your Charge is , to enquire whether they , or any of them , are guilty of this Felony and Murder , or not guilty ; if you find them guilty , you are to enquire what Goods and Chattels they had , at the Time the Felony was committed ; if you find them not guilty , you are to enquire whether they fled for it ; if you find they fled for it , you are to enquire of their Goods and Chattels , as if you had found them guilty ; if you find they did not fly for it , say so , and no more , and hear your Evidence . Counsel . My Lords , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , this is an Indictment against Edward Johnson , Nicholas Williams , Lawrence Senett , Nicholas Wolf , Pierce Butler , and John Bryan , otherwise O'Bryan , the Prisoners at the Bar , for Murder . The Indictment sets forth , that the Prisoners being Mariners in a Ship called the Dove , about a League distant from Leghorn in Italy , in Parts beyond the Seas , and within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England , on the 7th of September , in the Tenth Years of his Majesty 's Reign , with Force and Arms , on the High Seas , and within the Jurisdiction aforesaid , on Benjamin Hawes , then Master of the said Ship , did make an Assault ; and that Edward Johnson , with a Knife made of Iron and Steel , which he held in his Right Hand , the said Benjamin Hawes , feloniously , wilfully , and of his Malice aforethought , did strike and stab , giving him the said Benjamin , a mortal Wound of the Length of one Inch , and the Depth of three Inches , of which mortal Wound he then and there died ; and so he , the said Edward Johnson , him , the said Benjamin , did kill and murder . And the Indictment further charges , that Nicholas Williams , Lawrence Senett , Nicholas Wolf , Pierce Butler , and John Bryan , otherwise O'Bryan , were present , aiding , abetting , assisting , and comforting the said Edward Johnson , at the Time of committing the said Felony and Murder . The Prisoners have pleaded , Not guilty , if we prove they are guilty , we doubt not but you will find them so . Counsel . My Lords , and Gentlemen of the Jury : The Prisoners at the Bar , are indicted for the Murder of Benjamin Hawes , Master of the Dove Brigantine , this was an English Ship , which Sail 'd from Harwich in the Year 1730 , on trading Voyages , towards the Mediterranean , and other Parts . The Nature of these trading Voyages is such , that when the Mariners have made a Port of Delivery , they claim being paid their Wages and their Discharge : This Custom laid the Captain under a Necessity , several Times to change his Crew ; and at the Time , the Fact we charge against the Prisoners was committed , there was no Person on board beside themselves , except one Walker , the Captain 's Apprentice . In June 1736 , the Ship was at Marseilles , mann 'd with three Italians , and one French Man , and the Master 's Apprentice , and there the Prisoner Williams was shipp 'd as Captain 's Mate . From Marseilles they proceeded to Leghorn ; at Leghorn ( it being the Usage to discharge the Crew ) the Italians and the French Man were discharg 'd , and there he waited for a Cargo to take on board for England . When he had been at Leghorn about six Weeks , Johnson and one Derrick , a Dutch Man , were hired as foremast Men , and there was one O Mara came on board there as a Passenger ; Bryan , Wolf , and Butler came on board unknown to the Captain , who having taken in his Cargo ( which consisted of Sugars , Tobacco , and other Goods , consigned to Messina and Ancona ) he came on board the 7th of September 1736 , in order to prepare for Sailing ; the Time he came on board was about nine or ten o'Clock at Night , and according to his Order , the Vessel was got ready to sail ; but it happen 'd at that Time , there was but a very little Wind ; so the Master order 'd the Mate , when the Wind came off the Land , he should heave Anchor ; for though there was but little Wind , yet ( it seems ) there is a Breeze comes off the Land at some Seasons . When the Captain had given proper Orders , he retired to his Cabbin , to take his Rest : And about half an Hour , or three Quarters of an Hour after his - Retirement , the Boy Walker , his Apprentice ( who had been on board the Ship from the Time of her out-setting ) he heard Groans and Shrieks as of a dying Man , and immediately saw the Prisoner Johnson coming up the Companion Ladder with a Knife in his Hand and bloody . The Boy being astonished , asked Williams the Mate about the Noise , and enquired what was the Matter . At this Time , he found Johnson , Senett , and the Dutchman , at the Windlace : Senett had a Handspike in his Hand , and he put it into the Windlace on the one Side , and the Dutch man put another into the other Side , and Johnson was casting off the Stopper . These are Terms of Art , and we mention them to express Acts used in weighing Anchor ; and these shew they were then weighing Anchor . The Boy was surprized at what they were doing , and asked them why they heav 'd Anchor when there was no Wind stirring to assist them , but he finding them resolved to Sail , he thought proper to get every Thing in Readiness ; so he went down into the Captain 's Cabbin for his Shoes . He found the Cabbin door open , and the Captain , bloody and wounded in such a Manner , as you will best hear from the Evidence himself . He went immediately to the Prisoner Williams ( the Mate ) and told him the Captain was kill 'd : Williams said , the Lord have mercy upon me ! and used Expressions , - whether they denoted Guilt , or were only Words , the Effect of Compassion , must be left to you ; but the Boy having seen Johnson come up bloody , he desired the Mate to lash him to the Ring-bolts , supposing him to have committed the Murder ; but Williams instead of doing this , went immediately to Johnson and talked with him , and then Johnson went and seized the Boy , to prevent his discovering the Iniquity they had committed , and swore he would kill him too . The Boy had Resolution enough to strike him on the Arms , so he got clear , and ran to the Gang way of the Ship , and Johnson call 'd out kill him , kill him , and he apprehending Danger , jumped over-board into the Sea , and Johnson threw his bloody murdering Knife after him into the Sea , but it happened only to cut his Trousers . The Boy was no sooner in the Sea , but they were for pursuing him , and they mann 'd out the Boat to catch him , and prevent his making a Discovery : They row 'd after him , but could not take him ; he swam to some Ships that lay in the Mole at Leghorn , and discover 'd the Murder : Upon which several Boats , from the Merchant-Ships in the Mole of Leghorn , were mann 'd out , and they seized the Prisoners . Derrick the Dutchman was taken among them , but he dy 'd in his Passage . When the Company in these Boats boarded the Ship , they found the Captain dead , and there were Disputes among the Prisoners ; Williams said , it signify 'd nothing to deny the Murder , for Johnson had done it . Senett , Johnson , and Butler had hid themselves in the Hold of the Ship , under some Hides . This was a concerted Matter , to put the Captain out of the Way , - to kill him , in order to secure the Ship to themselves . I will not touch upon the Piracy , that will come under your Consideration hereafter . The Evidence of their Acting all in Conjunction , will be strong against them , and in Point of Law , they are all Principals in Murder , where all concur in Murdering a Subject of the Crown . 'T is a melancholy Case ; and I had rather the Circumstances should come from the Witnesses themselves , than open them my self , therefore I shall leave them to your Consideration . Richard Walker was call 'd and sworn . Counsel . Do you know the Vessel call 'd the Dove Brigantine : Walker . Yes ; I belonged to her nine Years : Benjamin Hawes was Master . Counsel . When did you go from England in her last ? Walker . About six Years ago : We went from Harwich and Falmouth : I was the Captain 's Apprentice , and was to go with him all his Voyages for a certain Term of Years . Counsel . Where was you in June last ? Walker . At Leghorn . Counsel . Who had you on board at that Time ? Walker . Williams was Mate , and Johnson was a Mariner ; Senett was a Mariner likewise , and one Derrick a Dutchman was a Mariner too . Counsel . Had you no one else on Board ? Walker . Yes ; we had one O Mara a Passenger on board , and none else , but the Captain and my self . Counsel . When was you to sail from Leghorn ? Walker . We were to sail from thence the 7th of September . Counsel . Were the rest of the Prisoners at the Bar on Board ? Walker . I did not see them then . The Master gave Directions on the 7th of September , that as soon as the Wind came off the Land , they should heave the Anchor ; and then he went down into his own Cabbin , and went to sleep , and I went and lay down on the Quarter-Deck , over his Head , and went to sleep likewise . Counsel . What follow 'd upon that ? Walker . I heard a shrieking and groaning , which 'wak 'd me . Counsel . What Time o'Night was this ? Walker . I believe it was half an Hour past Ten when I heard it . Counsel . What sort of a Noise was it ? Walker . Like the Groans of a dying Man . I could not then tell what it was ; so I got up , and was coming round the Companion , and I met Johnson with a Knife in his Hand , and his Right Hand was all bloody . I asked him why he was bloody , and went down directly to see what was the Matter . I call 'd Williams three times by Name , and he ask 'd me what was the Matter ? I ask 'd him if he was hurt ; he said , No . I desired he would let me look at him ; he said , may be the Captain is dreaming . Counsel . Were they heaving the Anchor at this Time ? Walker . Yes ; Sennet had put a Handspike into the Windlace on one Side , and the Dutchman had another in the other Side , and Johnson was casting off the Stopper , in order to heave up the Cable . Senett said to Williams , shall we heave up the Anchor ? Aye ( says he ) with all my Heart , Boys - Turn too Lads ; heave it up with all my Heart . Counsel . What did you say to them ? Walker . I said , what signifies heaving the Anchor , when the Vessel wo n't work ? Williams said , the Captain had order 'd it ; and I said , then I will go down for my Shoes : I had locked the Cabbin Door , ( single lock 'd it ) when the Captain went to sleep , and I left the Key in the Door : when I set the Door open , I was frighted at what I saw . Counsel . What did you see ? Walker . I saw the Captain half on the Bed , and half off , all bloody , and he appeared to me to be dead . Counsel . What did you do upon this ? Walker . I went up upon Deck , and met Williams , and I said Mr. Williams , the Captain is dead ; who has kill 'd him ? Counsel . What Answer did he make ? Walker . Lord have Mercy upon me , says he , I can not tell . I desired him to take Johnson and lash him to the Ring-bolts , and carry him ashore in the Morning , for , says I , I saw him coming up the Companion Ladder , all bloody . Counsel . What Answer did Williams make ? Walker . None at all , but only went forwards to Johnson , and I follow 'd him : Then Johnson took hold of me , and said , G - d d - n you , you Dog , I 'll kill you too . Counsel . Repeat that again . Walker . Johnson , when he took hold of me , said , G - d d - n you , you Dog , I 'll kill you too , and he struggled with me , and try 'd to take out his Knife ; but I gave him a Blow on the Arm , and he let me go ; then I jump 'd over-board , and as I was going off , Johnson cry 'd , d - n the Dog , kill him , kill him , do n't let him go ; and one of them threw a Knife after me into the Water , and it struck upon my Buttock . Counsel . Was Williams upon Deck at the same Time ? Walker . Yes , but I did not see him do any thing ; the Knife that was thrown after me , cut my Trowsers , but not my Flesh . Counsel . What follow 'd upon your jumping into the Sea ? Walker . They got into the Boat , and row 'd after me : Johnson was one who row 'd after me , but I did not mind who the others were : I swam , and they follow 'd me ; but I got to an Italian Settee , and I begg 'd of them ; for God 's Sake , to make them keep off , for they had kill 'd my Master , and wanted to kill me . They asked me who the Boat belong to , I told them ; then they hal 'd the Boat , and Johnson cry 'd , Hollo ; then the People in the Settee fir 'd upon them , and they then gave over the Pursuit , and return 'd to the Ship . Counsel . Did you see the Ship make any Sail after this ? Walker . Yes ; I saw the Ship go . Counsel . Which Way did she go ? Walker . From the Land . Counsel . So the Italians took you on board . Walker . Yes , they threw out a Rope and pull 'd me up , and examin 'd me : I would have had them put off , but they were afraid of being kill 'd themselves ; so they guarded me into the Mole , put me on board a Ship ; and presently there came Boats mann 'd and arm 'd from other Ships ; which went after them and took them : I came home with them ; but never had any Conversation with them . Counsel . You say you acquainted Williams with your seeing Johnson coming up the Companion Ladder . Walker . Yes . Counsel . Did he make any Answer to you ? Walker . No , not at all : but went directly up to Johnson . Counsel . Did he offer to seize Johnson ? Walker . No . Counsel . Was there any body could have helped him to have seiz 'd Johnson ? Walker . Yes , Senett ; and the rest of the Prisoners ; but they none of them offer 'd to seize him . Johnson seized me with one Hand , and with the other Hand , he felt in his Pocket for his Knife , and cry 'd , Aye , G - d d - n you , you Dog , I 'll kill you too ; but I struck him a Blow on the Arm , which made him let go , and I jump 'd over-board , and he cry 'd , Kill the Dog , do n't let him jump over-board ; but I swam away from them about 800 Yards . Counsel . What Place was the Ship bound for , when the Captain was kill 'd ? Walker . For Messina . Counsel . What Course did the Ship make after they were discover 'd ? Walker . They steer 'd right off the Land . Counsel . Was that towards Messina ? Walker . No . Counsel . What Ship took you in ? Walker . I swam first to an Italian Settee , and was afterwards taken on board the Levant , Capt . Floyd . Counsel . What did you observe the other Prisoners do ? Walker . I was so much 'frighted that I did not mind what they were doing . Q . Did you see Wolf there ? Walker . No ; I can not say whether he was in the Ship at the same Time or not . Q . What was Senett doing ? Walker . I did not see him , after the Captain was kill 'd : He was weighing Anchor before I found him kill 'd . Counsel . When they were weighing Anchor , was there a proper Wind to go on the Voyage ? Walker . No , there was not . Counsel . After you came on shore , and made the Discovery , did you go on Board again ? Walker . Yes ; when the Ship was brought to , I did , when they were made Prisoners . Counsel . Did you see the Body of the Captain , after his Death ? Walker . Yes ; there was a Wound 3 Inches and 3 Quarters long , 'athwart his Breast : There was two Wounds , but I put my Hand into the largest , and the Surgeon measur 'd it : 'T was a long Wound , and it went quite thro ' his Back , and was an Inch and a half wide there : The great Wound went ; om his Breast , quite thro ' his Body , and thro ' his Back ; but there was another smaller Wound here , in this Place , ( pointing to his own Ribs . ) Counsel . You said you saw Senett , Williams and Johnson ; was that after you heard the groaning of the Captain ? Walker . Yes . Q . How long was it after the Fact was committed that the Ship was brought in ? Walker . 'T was brought in about 3 Hours after , by several English Boats , which were in the Harbour , and then the Prisoners were taken out of her , and two of them were put on Board one Ship , and two on Board another : They were distributed on board other Ships . Wolf was brought home with me in the Dolphin Man of War . Q . What shap 'd Knife was it that Johnson had in his Hand ? Walker . A French Clasp Knife , about eleven Inches long , Handle and all , with a sharp Point ; the Blade toward the Bottom was about three Fourths of an Inch broad , and about a quarter of an Inch at the Point : The Handle was longer than the Blade . Counsel . Do you think the Wound could be made with that Knife ? Walker . Yes it might . Counsel . You say you saw his Hands bloody . Walker . Yes . Counsel . Was the Knife bloody ? Walker . I did not observe that : When I saw him , he was shutting it , with both his Hands , and I saw his right Hand bloody . The Knife was found next Morning in the Boat they row 'd after me , and in the Hollow of the Handle was all greasy and bloody , and there were Hairs sticking in it . Counsel . What sized Man was the Captain ? Walker . A stout , lusty , fat Man . Counsel . Do you believe the Knife you saw in the Boat , was the same you saw in Johnson 's Hands ? Walker . Yes , I am sure 't was the same . Jury . We ask whether he knows how the Knife came into the Boat , because he has mention 'd a Knife being thrown after him into the Sea ? Walker . It was not the Knife that I saw in his Hand , that was thrown after me , but another . Johnson 's clasp Knife was found in the Boat , three or four Hours after 't was brought in with the Ship . I did not see it in the Boat when it first came in . Counsel . So you say this Knife was found in the same Boat that Johnson was rowing in , after you . Walker . Yes Sir . Counsel . What Shape was the Handle of the Knife ? Walker . At the bottom of the Handle it was roundish ; at that Part next the Blade it was flat . Counsel . Do you think , that if a Wound was made with the Blade , any Part of the Handle , would go into the Wound ? Walker . Yes , Sir . C. Recollect your selves ; would any of you ask the Witness any Questions . Johnson . I have no Questions to ask him ; he knows nothing of me , nor I of him . Williams . I would ask him whether as the Wind was S. W. we did not sail the direct way to Ancona Walker . No ; 't was a fine clear Moon-light Night , and all the while I was going in a Boat from the Settee to the Ship , I had Sight of her , and she was steering quite off from the Land . Q . How long was it before you got from your own Ship to the Settee ? Walker . About half a Quarter of an Hour . Q . How long was it after you got into the Settee , that you got into an English Vessel ? Walker . About half an Hour . Senett . I observ 'd the Witness said , I had a Handspike in the Windlace . The Dutchman came to me , as I was lying on the Forecastle , and he 'wak 'd me ; I got up and said to Williams , are you going to heave up ? No , says Williams there 's no Wind . Why , says I , the Dutchman , has wak 'd me to heave up ; then says Williams , you may go to sleep again . Ask him about my Behaviour in the Ship . Walker . He obey 'd Command in the Ship , as other Mariners ought to do . He had been about six Weeks on board , when this happened ; and was taken in at Leghorn . Counsel . Call William O Mara ; who was very Sick , but was sworn . Counsel . Do you know the Dove Brigantine ? O Mara . Yes , I did Sir . Counsel . What Time did you come on Board ? O Mara . Sometime in August 1736 , I do n't remember the particular Day . Counsel . Who was on Board when you came first . O Mara . There was Williams ; he was the chief Man ; he at the Bar there . There was Andrew Downing , - Lawrence Senett ; I do n't know that Johnson was there : He belonged to the Ship at that Time , but was not concerned in any Business , in the wicked Enterprize they went upon ; nor Wolf . Bryan was . Butler was not there at that Time . Counsel . Give an Account what pass 'd the 7th of September , after that August you speak of , with Relation to the Captain 's coming on Board , and ordering the Ship to be put under Sail ; tell what pass 'd that Night . O Mara . I was asleep in the Mate 's Cabbin , and Wolf with me . About 11 or 12 I heard a great Groan in the Captain 's Cabbin ; I said , O ! dear Wolf , what is the Matter ! G - d d - n thee , says he , canst not sleep , and in about 3 Minutes Time , Walker went down . I heard the Gushes of Blood run from the Orifices , as if a Bung-hole had been made in his Body . Counsel . How near did you lye to the Captain ? O Maria . I lay in the Larboard-side of the Ship , and the Captain 's Cabbin was just at my Head , and nothing between us , but a slight Partition . He lay more in the Center of the Ship , than I did Counsel . When you heard the Groans and the gushing out of the Blood , what did you do ? O Maria . Nothing in the World : but then , in about 3 Minutes after , Walker came down and went in , in his Shirt ; when he saw the Captain dead , he ran to Williams and said , O ! Mr. Williams , the Captain 's dead , then I heard Johnson say , kill the Dog , kill the Dog , meaning Walker and they had a Jostle together about half a Minute , well , ( says I ) now the Boy is kill 'd and there 's no Remedy . In a short Time after this , I heard some body say , - see how naturally the Dog takes the Water . Counsel . Do you know any Thing of Senett , or Johnson , or any of the Prisoners endeavouring to weigh Anchor at that Time ? O Mara . I did not hear any Thing of that to my Knowledge ; as soon as the Noise began , they did not stay to get up the Anchor , for they cut the Cable . Counsel . Which of them cut the Cable ? O Mara . Williams did ; I was by at the same Time , and saw him cut it with a Hatchet . Q . What was the Reason that Williams cut the Cable ? O Mara . Oh ! - the Captain was killed , and he was going Captain . Q . How do you know that ? O. Mara . I have very good Reason to know it . - I myself drew the Articles by which he was constituted , nominated , and appointed so . There were Articles drawn twice , but Downing had nothing to do with them . Counsel . Do you know of any Combination among the Prisoners ? O Mara . I do , - I know it all ; I was a Party - concerned myself . Counsel . Begin , and give an Account when you first came on board , and what passed between you ? What was the Occasion of your first coming on board ? Who tempted you on board ? O Mara . John O Bryan , one of the Prisoners ; he brought me on board , and told me , that I must go no more to my own Ship , for somebody had told Sir Mark Forrester , who was the Captain ( 't was a Spanish Man of War ) that I had given it out , that he was Knighted by a Bricklayer 's Son , meaning the Pretender , and O Bryan told me , that he would hang me up when I went on Board ; this drove me to Despair , and made me willing to go any where . He told me he had got a Birth , and was going Mate of a Dutch Ship the Dove Brigantine ; he called it a Dutch Ship , and said , if I pleased I might take a Birth along with him ; so I went on board the Dove with him , and I met Mr. Williams in the first Place , and Downing and Lawrence Senett . Counsel . What Discourse had you together ? O Mara . They brought out a Prayer-Book , and swore me to Secrecy , and I swore . When they had done taking the Oath , they said this Ship was richly laden , and belonged to Jews , and that it was no Sin to carry it away from them . They said the Ship ( 't was given out ) belonged to a Dutchman , but that was only a Sham and a Pretence . To get me into their Contrivances , they proposed to go away with the Ship , and sell her and her Cargo on the Coast of Portobel or Gallicia , and every one was to have an equal Dividend . Counsel . Who made the Proposition ? O Mara . All ; they all joined , Williams , Senett , O Bryan , and Downing I agreed with them in it , and we went ashore directly , and called Butler , and we drew up the Articles at a Publick House , the Sign of the Ship and Mermaid , at Leghorn . Counsel . Who drew up the Articles ? O Mara . I did , and we all signed them . Williams signed first . Counsel . What was the Substance of the Articles ? O Mara . The Substance was , that Williams should be Captain ; O Bryan , Mate ; Senett was to be Boatswain , and Downing was to be Second Mate ; there was something to be for every one ; every one was to have a Post , and so they gave me the Name of Doctor . Counsel . What followed upon this ? O Mara . When we had signed the Articles , Williams and Senett went on board again ; Downing , Butler , Bryan , and I , stay 'd ashore . Counsel . What Office was Butler to have ? you have not mentioned his Post . O Mara . I had forgot him ; he was to be Supercargo . Counsel . Well , and what did you all do ashore . O Mara . Why , that Night we drank upon the Strength of what Williams gave us . Counsel . What did he leave you to spend ? O Mara . A Chequin . Counsel . When did you see them again ? O Mara . About two Days after , Downing , Butler , and I , sent aboard for Williams and Senett to come ashore to us , and we pretended that we had other Men who would join with us in the Business . This we did to get the Paper out of William 's Hands , for took it when we had signed it . Counsel . Repeat again the Names of the Persons that signed , and the Order in which they signed . O Mara . William 's signed first , as Captain ; O Bryan , as Mate , second ; Pierce Butler , third , as Supercargo ; Downing , fourth , as Second Mate ; Senett , fifth as Boatswin ; and I said , Gentlemen , I am satisfied with any Thing ; so I sign 'd - Doctor . Counsel . What did you do with them when they came on Shore ? O Mara We got the Paper from them and burnt it , and departed , resolving never to see one another more Counsel . What made you desire to get the Paper again ? O Mara . Disunion among us . Counsel . How came you to go to the Ship again ? O Mara . O Bryan and I took out a Bill of Health to go to Genoa on the 20th of August , but we had not the good Fortune to meet with a Felucca , so we were obliged to stay in the Town Counsel . Who burnt the Articles ? O Mara . Williams , he would not give them out of his Hand ; he pulled out a Paper , and said , here they are , and he held it over the Candle and burnt it ; I believe it was the Articles . Q . Consider , you swore the Articles were burnt , now you say , you do n't know whether they were or not ; you must say nothing upon Surmise . O Mara . He produced a Paper , and said it was the Articles ; 't was very much like them , and he held it over the Candle 'till 't was burnt ; we did not care to shew Names . Downing was the Person that call 'd out most for the Articles . Williams at first told us the Articles were on Board , but afterwards , when there was some Words about them , he drew out a Paper , and held it over the Candle , and burnt it , and said - there 't is in Ashes Councel . What happen 'd after the Paper was burnt ? O Mara . Sometime afterwards , they began with us again : Williams spoke to Senett , and then they took Johnson in and me . We drew second Articles among us four , and I wrote the Articles by William 's Direction . They were of the same Purport with the other , only the Names of the Mates , and Supercargo , and Boatswain were chang 'd . Counsel . Who sign 'd these second Articles ? O Mara . Williams sign 'd first as Captain , Senett sign 'd second for Mate , I sign 'd next for Supercargo , and Johnson for Boatswain . And to these second Articles there was none conscious but us four , to my Knowledge . Counsel . What Time were these Articles sign 'd ? O Mara . 'T was before the Captain was kill 'd , about a Week before , or thereabouts . I went on Board and remain 'd on board from that Time 'till the Captain was kill 'd . Counsel . Had you any Discourse together what was to be done with the Ship ? O Mara . There was nothing fix 'd where we were to go , some said we 'll go to Sallee , some said to Angier , some said go here , some there . Councel . Were these Articles too , put into William 's Hands ? O Mara . Yes , and I saw them afterwards in his Hands , he deliver 'd them into my Hands the Night before the Captain was kill 'd , and that very same Night too . O'Bryan came on board the latter End of the Night , before the Captain was kill 'd , and Butler with him . I was the first that saw them after they came on board , they had swam to us from the Lazaretto , and I told Williams that O'Bryan and Butler were come ; and he propos 'd the Affair to them . We had then on board Williams , Johnson , Senett , Butler , O'Bryan , and my self ; all the Ship 's Hands were upon Deck , these were all on board the Night the Captain was kill 'd . Councel . Was the Design of killing the Captain , and running away with the Ship , mention 'd to all these ? O'Bryan . Yes , and they declin 'd doing it that Night , because 't was past 3 o'Clock , and they were afraid they should be taken before they could get off . Coun . Did any one of 'em oppose the doing it ? O Mara . No , not one ; they only declin 'd doing it that Night , because 't was so near Morning they were afraid of being taken . Councel . Did Johnson sign the second Articles ? O Mara . Yes , he sign 'd the second Articles , but not the first , Johnson was to be Boatswain . Councel . What were the Conditions of these Articles , with Regard to the Captain ? O Mara . Some were for putting him to Death ; but in the written Articles , that was left to Williams , and he said he would put him on Shore at Gallieto . By the Articles Williams was to do as he pleased with him . We had great Disputes about the Captain ; some were for putting him on Shore at Gallieto , ( a desolate Island on the Coast of Africa ) with some Provisions , and among these , Williams was one . Jury . Was he to be put ashore dead or alive ? O Mara . Alive , - alive , - we were to give him Provisions , I told you . Q . How far distant is Gallieto from any other Island ? O Mara . Thirty or Forty Leagues . Q . How long after the Captain 's coming on Board was it that he was kill 'd ? O Mara . He was kill 'd the first Night he lay on board ; he had been absent from the Ship a Day or two . Councel . Had you any Consultations while the Captain was on board ? O Mara . No , not a Word , nor a Word of the Articles , while he was aboard Councel . After Butler and O'Bryan came on board , had you any Consultation ? O Mara . After they came on board , Williams said he had a Mind to slip , and one of them said it would be hard to do that , for Fear the Crew should be in Liquor , and the Wind should blow hard . Councel . Was Wolf present at any of the second Meetings ? O Mara . Yes , very often . Councel . Had they any Discourse what to do with the Powder and Guns ? O Mara . Yes , the Morning after Bryan and Butler came aboard , they all went forward to the Captain 's Cabbin and the Steerage , and I went down after them , and they eat some dried Fish , and drank some of that Country Wine , and after they had done eating , they took down 6 Fuzees which hung in the Cabbin , and Williams charg 'd them with a single Ball in each of them . Wolf asked him , how many Balls he had put in ? he said but one ; Wolf said , G - d 's Bl - d , a single Ball may fly here and there and do no Execution ; so he put another Ball into every one of them , and said they should do sure Work ; then I apprehended Murder would be done . I us 'd to hear them very often threat'ning Dick Walker , - that they 'd be even with him : They have said an hundred Times , D - n their Bloods , the first Opportunity they had , they would get him out of the Way , - a vile Dog as he was , for opposing them . Counsel . Who said so ? O Mara . Williams has said so some Times , but rather seldomer than the others ; Senett and Johnson has often said , - d - n the Dog he should have a shite , meaning a Shoot . Counsel . Was it propos 'd that Bryan and Butler should sign the Articles ? O Mara . Yes ; they desir 'd to see them , and Williams gave them into my Hands to read to them . I did so ; and Bryan and Butler began to Swear and Damn , because in these second Articles , others were substituted in their Places : But Williams said he would make them all easy , when he was got out to Sea . Senett told him , that Johnson and himself had most trouble in lading the Ship , and says he shall others run away with the Substance . Then says Williams , do you take one of the Men , and I will take t'other , and we 'll put them out of your Way , and they drew their long Knives , but Johnson said , if any Dog offered to come near him , he would rip him up ; Bryan seeing this , said he would swim ashore again . Q . How soon after this did the Captain come aboard . O Mara . I was asleep when he came , but I believe it was about nine or ten at Night . I went to sleep about Duskish , and slept till the Groan awaked me , that was between Eleven and Twelve . Q . Do you know who went in the Boat to pursue the Boy . O Mara . I was below when the Boat went out , but I saw it return , Johnson and Butler came back in it . I heard Senett and Johnson say , G - d 's Bl - d , the Dog ca n't swim far , he has got the Knife in his Body , however , take the Boat and row after him . When Johnson and Butler returned to the Ship , Johnson said , - Oh ! you treacherous Dogs , G - d d - n you , could not you keep that Boy aboard , when I had done the Work of the Great Man , and killed him myself ; and he drew out his Knife , and swore he would kill himself , because his Hands had miss 'd the Boy ; but I got hold of him , and said , For God 's Sake do n't send yourself to Heaven ( to Hell , I meant ) as yet . The Knife was bloody at that Time , I knew it , and I know he stole it from a Frenchman ; the Blade was six or seven Inches long . Q . Did he say he had killed the Captain in the Hearing of the Prisoners ? O Mara . Yes , - of every one of them , and they did not blame him at all , only Bryan and Butler blamed him for killing him before they were got out to Sea . Williams said , that was the Misfortune . Q . Who cut the Cable , and what Part of it was cut ? O Mara . Williams cut it at the Windlace , there was about three Turns upon the Wind-lace . Williams . Dick Walker came and begged of me to take that Witness on board as a Passenger . Walker . I deny it ; Williams asked me to let him come on board , and I said I would ask the Captain 's Leave , and I did so , and the Captain said he might come , but he should pay for his Passage . John Legard . I was Chief Mate of the Levant , I saw Walker begging in the Water to be taken on board ; and heard him pray for his Assistance , his Master being killed ; he was taken in , and presently five Boats were mann 'd out and arm 'd ; I was one that boarded the Brig . Bryan jumped over-boards but another Boat took him up again ; Williams , Wolf , and an Indian ( born at the Cape-of-good-Hope ) were upon Deck ; Senett , Johnson , Bryan , and the Witness O Mara were hid in the Forescuttle under some raw Buffalo 's Hides ; d - n you , says I , to Williams , what have you done with the Captain , after some Time being silent , he said , he 's a dead Man , and not a Man for this World . I went down into the Cabbin , and saw him lie on the Floor with his Hand on the Wound , and the Corpse was covered with a Sheet , his Scrutore broke open , and his Papers lying about . Williams said to Johnson , Johnson , do n't deny it ; you are the Man that killed the Captain , and I cut the Cable ; and the Dutchman said , Awe , thot 's the Mon thot slaaw 'd the Coptain , and he said nothing at all in his own Excuse . Williams told us the Captain had always been very good ; and he believed the Devil was in him , and he expected nothing but to die ; so I sent him a Bible , and bid him make good Use of it . When we pulled the rest of them out from under the Hides , O Mara was very obstropolous , and told us he was the King of Spain 's Subject ; but we broke a Cutlass about his Shoulders , and made him quiet . Mr. Rogers . I was one who boarded this Brig , we found Wolf , Williams , and the Dutch-Indian , on Deck ; I thought there must be more Men concealed , so I asked Williams for a Tinder-Box and Candle ; he told me he knew of none ; we told him he deserved to have his Nose cut off , - he a Mate , and not know where to find a Tinder-Box ; at last , we found one , and got a Light to search for the Men who were hid ; we saw their Legs under the Hides , but they would not come out ; but upon our threatning to fire among them , O Mara , Johnson , Butler , and Senett , came out , and we secured them . Williams said , the Captain was very good to him , that he never eat nor drank without him , and he believed the Devil possessed him . He told Johnson it signified nothing to deny it . After this Senett confessed the whole Affair , and at his own Request I took an Account thereof in Writing . He told me that Williams swore him first to Secresy , and when he had sworn , he ( Williams ) told him the Vessel was richly laden , and if he could procure others to acquiesce with him , it might be run away with . Upon this he brought Downing to Williams , and after he was sworn to Secrecy , Williams told him ( Downing ) that the Captain was to be killed , that no Stories might be told . Williams said that for his Part , he was rather for setting the Captain ashore on a Desolate Island but Johnson insisted on his being killed , and said , it would not be the first ( by many ) that he had put out of the Way . That Downing was the Man who first proposed killing the Captain . The Prisoners had nothing material to say in their Defence , nor any Witnesses to call , either to the Fact , or their Characters . Edward Johnson , Guilty . Nicholas Williams , Guilty . Senett , Wolf , Butler , and Bryan , Acquitted . Edward Johnson , Nicholas Williams , Lawrence Senett , were indicted a second Time , for feloniously and piratically endeavouring to make , and causing to be made , a Revolt in the said Ship , and running away with the same , Sept. 7 . as aforesaid . The Evidence upon this Indictment was the same as upon the former Trial , and the Jury found them all Guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] The Trials being over , the Court proceeded to give Judgment . Received Sentence of Death , 4. Richard Coyle , Edward Johnson , Nicholas Williams , and Lawrence Senett .
