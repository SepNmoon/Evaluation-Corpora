Elizabeth Hart , of St. Peter Cheap , was indicted for privately stealing a Fan , value 10 s. the Goods of Robert Andrews , seven Yards of Cambrick , value 20 s. two Holland Aprons , value 5 s one Cambrick Handkerchief , value 2 s. the Goods of Benjamin Baddily ; a Holland Mob , value 1 s. three Caps , three Aprons , and other Things , the Goods of Ann Weston , in the House of Benjamin Baddily , Nov. 7 . Benjamin Baddily . The Prisoner came to me as a Servant , September 22 , and was turn 'd away Nov. 8 . After she was discharged , this Parcel of Cambrick was found conceal 'd in her Bed ; another Servant found it , and brought it to me . I examined the Stock in my Shop , and found I had lost Cambrick , but I can not swear to this , because she has destroy 'd the Mark . The Fan belongs to a Lady who came to my House on Lord-Mayor 's Day to see the Show ; 't is a very particular Thing , and I took particular Notice of it , and swear 't is the same . The Day after she was discharged , I went in pursuit of her , and found her ; I tax 'd her with the Goods , and she confess 'd she stole the Cambrick while the Family was at Church , and that the Fan was at one Mary Brand 's House ; she took it off the Table in the Dining-Room ; she own 'd she took the Fan , the Cambrick , and this Apron . I did promise , ( in order to bring her to a Confession ) that I would be as favourable to her as I could ; but I did not promise her that I would not prosecute her . Mary Brand . A Day or two after my Lord-Mayor 's Day , the Prisoner brought this Fan to me , to keep for her ; she told me that she found it ; but when she came so suddenly from her Place , I delivered it to her again ; she did not care to take it , and desired I would burn it ; I refus 'd , and her Master taxing her with it , she return 'd it to him . Ann Weston . I live with my Brother Baddily ; we had a Suspicion that she was not honest , therefore she was turn 'd away . The Cambrick being found in the Bed where the Prisoner lay , I went immediately to look over my Things , and miss 'd an Apron and a Cap : The Apron she brought again , and confess 'd to me that she took it ; but as the Mark is taken out , I will not take upon me to swear 't is the same I lost . Elizabeth Callowell . I was the Prisoner 's fellow Servant ; she desired me , just before she went away , to look in her Bed for some Cambrick which she had bought to make Handkerchiefs , and begg 'd I would convey it to her unknown to my Master . I found it , and it was shew 'd to my Master . Mr. Baddily . This is the Cambrick which she confess 'd she took from me . Callowell . She confess 'd the same in my hearing . Ann Abbot . I live with Miss Andrews , and was with her at Mr. Baddily 's on Lord-Mayor 's Day : My Lady had this Fan with her there ; but at Night it was missing , and could not be found . Prisoner . I know nothing of the Things they charge me with ; the Fan indeed I found next Morning in the Dining-Room , and gave it to Mary Brand to keep for me . John Barker , James Bruce , Susannah Brace , Mary Cartwright , Elizabeth Osborn , Catherine Cadman , and Mrs. West , appear 'd to the Prisoner 's former good Character . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 2. Phillis Pratter , otherwise Fratter , was indicted for privately stealing 12 Yards of Cloth Calimancoe , 21 Yards of Persian , one Yard of green Ducape , four Yards of white Sattin , a Quarter of a Yard of green half-ell damask , half a yard of yellow worsted Damask , a Quarter of a Yard of Holland , three Holland Shirts , three Pair of Scissars , a Pair of Bathmetal Buckles , one Yard of scarlet Tabby , two Yards of blue Velvet , three Yards of Cloth-colour 'd Shagreen , one Yard and half of blue Mantua Silk , two Yards of Cloth-colour 'd Silk Damask , one Yard of Brocade Silk , and other Mercery Goods , the Property of William Ryder , in the Parish of St. Sepulchre 's October 30 . William Ryder . The Prisoner was my Servant a Year and three Quarters , and as some of my Servants lay in the Shop , she used to make their Beds . I suspected her to be dishonest , for we frequently miss 'd Half-pence out of a Box behind the Counter . Once we told 4 or 5 s. worth , and miss 'd 15 d. Another time we miss 'd 2 s. 4 d. I taxed her with robbing me , and searched her Trunk ; this was Nov. 30 I took out 12 Yards 3 quar . of Cloth-colour 'd Calimanco ; 21 Yards of yellow Persian , in two Quantities ; one Yard of white half-ell Sattin ; a Remnant of green half-ell Damask ; a Remnant of half-yard yellow Ditto ; a Remnant of yellow worsted Damask ; two Remnants of Holland and Scotch Cloth ; three Holland Shirts mark 'd with my Name , some Scissars of my Servants and mine ; a Pair of Bathmetal Buckles , these Things I can swear to . We found several other Things at one Mr Jordan 's Lodging in Swallow-Street , who was an Acquaintance of hers , and had been at my House several times : Here we found one Yard of scarlet Tabby , some broad black Velvet , three Yards of Cloth-colour 'd Shagreen , two Yards and half of yellow , ditto ; half a yard of Damask , one Yard 1-8th of blue Mantua ; these and several other Things , were taken out of her Box at Jordan 's . At one Mr. Markham 's , a Baker , we found out two Yards and a Quarter of Cloth colour 'd Damask ; one Yard of half ell brocade Silk ; half a Yard of blue Silk Damask , half a Yard of scarlet Velvet ; half a Yard of figur 'd Stuff , and two Remnants of figur 'd Silk ; all these were ty 'd up in a Handkerchief of my Journeyman 's ; and we found likewise 3 s. which was Money we marked , but 't is not in the Indictment . Charles Trap . The Prisoner was my Master 's Servant near two Years ; but missing some Halfpence out of the Drawer , we suspected her to be dishonest : I put 6 s. in Half-pence into the Drawer my self , and lock 'd up the Shop ; she went in to make the Bed , and left the Door open : I was then at home , and am certain none went through the Shop . I told the Money over after she was gone out of the Shop , and miss 'd 2 s. 4 d. I acquainted my Master next Morning , and she was charged with it ; she deny 'd it ; but my Master insisting on her Boxes being open 'd , we found these Goods which have been mention 'd , and which I can swear to : I was present when they were found in her Room up two Pair of Stairs . She said nothing at all about the Goods ; and as to the Money , she said it was a Picque of the Journeymen to put her out of her Place . I was likewise present at the taking the Goods from the other Places : These were taken at Jordan 's in Swallow-Street ; I swear they are my Master 's . When the Prisoner was carried before Sir Richard Brocas , they were produced , and she confessed she took them . These Goods were taken at Charles Markham 's , a Baker in Westminster , ty 'd up in my Handkerchief . Markham had served a Family with Bread where she had liv 'd ; so he gave her Leave to put the Goods in a Trunk which she had had there a considerable Time . He told us the Trunk was her 's , and that she had left it there . She was committed to Newgate before we received Information of these Goods . Mr. Jordan . These Goods were left at my House , but I ca n't say who left them ; they were under Lock and Key , and the Box was brought by a Porter for the Prisoner ; I can not say , that the Prisoner put the Goods into the Box , it was at my House before she went to live at Mr. Ryder 's , nor did I ever see the Inside of it till Mr. Ryder 's Man open 'd it . Q . Did you never see it open 'd while it was at your House ? Jordan . She has opened it , but I never look 'd into it . Q . When she has open 'd it , have you never observ 'd her to put any Thing in it ? Jordan . Not to my Knowledge ; she never open 'd it but once , and that was while she liv 'd with Mr. Ryder ; it was one Sunday Evening , and then I do n't remember I saw her put any Thing in , or take any Thing out . Mr. Ryder . I believe both these People to be honest ; when she went to their Houses , she might take no more Goods than she could conceal under her Apron , and she might convey them into her Boxes without their seeing her . Defence . I am not guilty ; I never took any Half-pence . Q . Can you give any Account , how Mr. Ryder 's Goods came to be in your Boxes ? Jordan . I have known her three or four Years , she was a Fellow Servant with my Wife , and never heard but that she was honest till now . Guilty . Death . 3. Thomas Winston , of St. Giles 's , Cripplegate , was indicted for stealing 600 Pound Weight of unwrought Copper , value 12 l. the Goods of Daniel Marcon , July 23 . Daniel Marcon . About the Middle of July last , the Ship Nancy ( of which I am in Part Owner ) arriv 'd from Barbary , of which there was a large Quantity of Copper , the Property of myself and two or three Merchants . In order to land this Copper it was put into Lighters , my Quantity was about 9 Tun Weight , 386 double Heads ; when my Part was landed at Galley-Key , I miss 'd nine double Heads ; I enquir 'd then , whether the other Proprietors had their Complement ; one miss 'd seven double Heads , another miss 'd a double Head and a half ; a double Head weighs about half a Hundred , some more , some less , they are in round Cakes , two of them join 'd together . I next enquir 'd , whether the Copper was all come from the Ship , and I found my whole Quantity had been put on board the Lighter ; I sold what was brought ashore upon the Keys , and told the Person who bought it , that I had not so much as I expected I enquired still after what I had lost , and about three Weeks afterwards , Mr. Briggs came and told me , he believ 'd he had discover 'd my Copper . I went with him to one Mr Gardiner 's in Barbican ; Mr. Gardiner was not at Home , but I saw the Copper , and took Notice of the Marks D , and D L P , on two Heads ; there was six or seven in a Heap . Mr. Briggs said , Mr. Gardiner was a Man of Honour , I might trust him ; and that he was sure he would give an Account how he came by them . Next Day I saw Mr Gardiner , and he told me that he bought the Copper of the Prisoner , and that Mr. Hone had bought another Parcel of him . I was obliged to take out a Search Warrant , but knowing the Prisoner 's Character , I did not make use of it . Mr. Hone shew 'd me the Copper he bought of the Prisoner , and I saw the Mark D on one of the Heads . We then sent for the Prisoner to a Publick House , and Word was brought us , that he was out of Town ; but about the latter End of Aug. Mr. Briggs , Mr. Gardiner , Mr. Hone , and myself , met at the White-Lyon Tavern in Aldersgate-Street , and the Prisoner came to us , with a Friend who was to advise him ; he own 'd he sold Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Hone the Copper , but he did not know the Person he himself bought it of . We allow 'd him two or three Days to find this Man out , but he could not , so I took the Prisoner before Sir Richard Brocas , who committed him ; he offer 'd Bail , I accepted it , and was in Hopes he would have found ( by this Time ) the Person that he bought it of . Mr. Gardiner . I have known the Prisoner about five Years , I have dealt with him in his little Way of Trade , he is a Founder as well as I . In July last he brought a Piece in his Hand to my Shop , and asked me if I wanted any Barbary Copper ; he asked 4 l per Hundred for it ; I said he must leave it for me to try , for some of this Barbary Copper proves very bad : He left me two Heads and they prov 'd indifferent , so I-gave him 4 l. per Hundred , and took a Receipt for the Money : I think there was about 300 l. weight , and I did not observe any Marks upon it , nor did Mr. Briggs , or Mr. Marcon shew me any ; but the Copper which Mr. Marcon claim 'd , was the same I bought of the Prisoner . The Discovery was made by my telling Mr. Briggs and Sir Thomas Mackworth , at the White Lyon Tavern in Aldersgate-street , that I had lately bought a little Parcel of Barbary Copper for 4 l. per Hundred . Sir Thomas said , if you have bought but a small Quantity , it is very likely it was stolen . I said , I had bought about three Hundred Weight , that it lay open in my Shop , and I knew who I bought it of . Q. I ask you , whether Winston used to deal in Copper , and in such Quantities ? Mr. Gardiner . A Man in Trade may take Copper for Goods . Q . Does he deal in casting Things of great Weight . Mr. Gardiner . No , small Things ; he is a Candlestick-Founder . I was one Day at Mr. Hone 's , and I saw he had got some Barbary Copper , and , says I , what , have you bought Barbary too ? What did you give for it ? Why , says he , the same Price that you did ; I bought it of the same Man , but I thought he had no more . Councel . Then he did not care to let you know what Quantity he had got . Mr. Gardiner . I did ask him how much he had got , and he told me he had about three Hundred Weight ; I thought I had bought all he had . When he met us at the White-Lyon Tavern , he told us , he had it of a Man that bought Candlesticks of him to the Value of 7 l. and who was a perfect Stranger to him . I said , that is stranger still , that you should buy so much Metal , and sell so many Candlesticks to a Man you knew nothing of . I asked him how the Man brought it , he said the Man came himself with Porters ( or a Cart , I can not remember which ) and took the Goods he bought away with him . He was asked , whether there was any Bills of Parcels or Receipts given , and he said no , there were none at all ; he said he would endeavour to find out the Man , and had his Liberty for three Weeks or a Month to do it , but at last he said he could not do it , and he believed he should hear no more of him . Councel . Is it usual for People to hawk such a Weight of Copper about with Porters , or in a Cart ? Mr. Gardiner . No . Councel Pris . Is it not usual for Founders to buy unwrought Copper for the Purposes of their Trade ? Mr. Gardiner . Yes . Council . And of Persons that come about with it ? Mr. Gardiner . I ca n't say so , but it is usual to take it in Truck for Goods . Prisoner . I ask Mr. Gardiner , whether , when my Servants carried the Copper to his House , he did not bid them go and bring him more ? Mr. Gardiner . No , I did not ; his Servant 's brought me the Copper and he was with them , and took the Money for it ; and I have his Receipt for it . Mr. Hone . The 27th of July last , the Prisoner brought me a Piece of Barbary Copper , and asked me to buy it . I said it was generally bad but if he would leave it for me to try it , if it proved good , I told him I would give 4 l 8 s. per Hundred for it . He left a single Head with me , about a Quarter of a Hundred , and I sent to Mr Gardiner to know the Price of Copper , for I did not know myself ; he sent me Word the Price was about 4 l per Hundred ; so when the Prisoner came , I said I had over-bid myself , and that I would not give more than 4 l. a Hundred . He took 4 l. and I bought 3 hundred and a half . He told me he had sold Goods to the value of 7 l 4 s. and took this in Payment for them . I had us 'd a good deal of it , before Mr. Marcon apply 'd to me for it , but he shew 'd me the Marks upon what was left , tho ' I should not have seen the Mark D upon it , if I had not call 'd for a Brush and clean 'd it . I have known the Prisoner these five Years , and I know 't is usual for him to take Brass and Copper from the Brasiers in Truck for his Work , and we thought him a fair dealer . Q . Did he tell you , he had sold some of this Copper to Gardiner ? Mr. Hone . Not at first ; he did afterwards . At the White-Lyon the Prisoner said , the Man he bought it of , was a Stranger to him , and that he waited at his Shop , while he received the Money of me to pay him for it . Councel . I would ask you , if it is usual to buy Copper in this manner ? Mr. Hone . We all of us have sometimes Metal which we ca n't use our selves . We have it commonly brought to our Shops . I never heard but that the Prisoner was an honest Man . Mr. Briggs . I never heard any thing to the contrary before . Mr. Marcon having lost Copper , and Mr. Gardiner telling me he had bought some , I carried Mr. Marcon to Mr. Gardiner 's to see it . He told us Mr. Hone 's , had bought some of the same . So we went to Mr. Hone 's , and sent for the Prisoner , 2 or 3 Nights together , but he was not at Home : At last he came with one Renshaw , who said he knew the Porters to be all Rogues , for he had been among them , and that it might be stole by them . Mr. Marcon allow 'd him Time to search after the Man he bought it of ; but at last he said he could make no Discovery , and bid us Defiance . Such parcels of Copper are not usually sold to Founders , in the Manner this was Sold , but by Merchants and Factors . Defence . A Man coming by while my two Boys were filing Candlesticks , he asked them if they made those Things ; they told him , Yes , and he asked for me . When I came to him , he told me he had some Barbary Copper to dispose of , and if I would buy it , he would take some of my Goods . I did not understand the Worth of it , so I went to Mr. Hone 's , and Mr. Gardiner 's , to know what they would give for it . I left a Piece with Mr. Gardiner to be try 'd , and he sent me Word in the Afternoon , that he would give but 4 l. per Hundred . I gave the Man I had it of 3 L. 18 s. and sold it for 4 l. The Man had three dozen Pairs of Candlesticks , and gave me 4 s. a Pair . Samuel Parkin . I have been the Prisoner 's Servant almost 7 Years : It was in July last my Master bought this Copper . I was at Work in the Window , and the Man asked me if we made such Things . I told him we did ; he came into our Shop ( we live in Beech-lane ) and I call 'd my Master to him : He said he wanted some Candlesticks , and had some Copper to dispose of , and if my Master would agree , he would traffick with him . He bespoke three dozen Pairs of Candlesticks , at 4 s. a Pair ; after this he brought the Copper , and my Master told him , if he would call again , he would let him know what he could give him for it : Then he carry 'd it to Mr. Hone 's , and the Man that brought the Copper was to have some Money , and some of our Goods for it . Three Days after he had agreed for the Candlesticks , he sent this Copper ( at twice ) to our Shop by two Porters ; each of them went twice back : My Master and the Man weigh 'd it , and my Master set down the Weigh : in a Paper , but I did not weigh it , nor see the Weight . He was a Sea-faring Man in brownish Cloaths , and Buttons of the same Colour , middle siz 'd , and had on a bob Wig . He brought it in about Two o'Clock in July last , but I ca n't remember the Day . Q . How much did your Master carry to Mr. Hone 's for trial ? Parkin . One whole Piece ; that is , two Pieces join 'd together . Q . When was the Copper paid for ? Parkin . Not 'till the Delivery of all the Goods . Q . What was your Master to give ? Parkin . Three Pounds 18 s. per Hundred . Q . Does not your Master keep a Book ? Parkin . We did not set these down . Q . How were they carried away ? Parkin . They were not packed up ; he took them away with him put up in Papers , in a Basket . Q . Does your Master keep a Book ? Parkin . Yes . Q . Does he enter what he buys and sells ? Parkin . No . Q . What does he keep the Book for ? Parking . He may enter Things in the Book , and I know nothing of it . Q . When your Master went to Mr. Hone 's to know the value of the Copper , did the Man stay in the Shop 'till he came back ? Parkin . No ; he went away and came back in about five Hours . Richard Jones . I was at Work when the Man bespoke the Candlesticks , and told my Master that he had Copper to dispose of ; he was a pretty lusty Man , middle-siz 'd for Height , in brown Cloaths and a bob Wig : He had it not with him then ; but he brought it about Two or Three o'Clock in the Afternoon , by two Porters at twice coming . My Master and I , and my fellow 'Prentice , weigh 'd it at several times . Q . Was Parkin ( your fellow 'Prentice ) by , when it was weigh 'd ? Jones . Yes ; and when the Weight was set down . The Gentleman asked my Master what he could give ; he said he must ask what it was worth , so he carry 'd some of it to Mr. Hone . I know nothing of the Paper in which the Weight was set down . Q . Did the Man that sold it , stay 'till your Master came back ? Jones . Yes ; he staid a great while ! but when my Master came back , they agreed about the Price . Mr. Hone said it was worth 4 l. and my Master gave the Man 3 l. 18 s. Q . How were the Candlesticks pack 'd up ? Jones . In Papers , and then put into a Bag . Q . Are you sure they were put into a Bag ? Jones . Yes , and the Bag ( I believe ) was put into a Basket . Q . Who carry 'd them away ? Jones . A Porter that stood at the Door . Q . Does your Master often buy Metal unrefin 'd ? Jones . No . Mr. Green . I have known the Prisoner ten or twelve Years ; he is a House-keeper , and as to his Character , I never knew him guilty of any thing like this . I would have been bound for him for a thousand Pounds . That Gentleman now has ask 'd so many Questions ! - Why , when he brings his Goods to me ; here 's a Piece of Chalk , and there 's a Piece of Chalk , and we cast up the one and the other . Q . And do you keep a chalk Account ? Mr. Green . Why these are my Work-folks , and when they bring in their Work , there 's the Chalk , and we cast up what it comes to , and pay them . This Man works for the Shops , and he 's able to buy a thousand times the Quantity ; not that he 's able to pay for it , - but he brings it to us , and we bid him buy it , if there 's any thing to be got . - There is some of this Barbary Copper now to be sold at a Broker 's in Drury-Lane . I have had it brought to my Shop by Jews , and Fellows unknown , but I would never trouble my self for 2 s. a Hundred Profit . I have sold Candlesticks that have come to 10 Guineas , and never book 'd them : And I have had 20 Pounds worth of Irish Half-pence , I have weigh 'd them : And where do you live , says I ? Why , if you 'll buy them you may , and if you wo n't , we 'll take them away . Barbary Copper , - 't is hawk 'd about , I have bought some To-day , I know nothing how 't is come by . Councel . Then you may buy stolen Goods , and subject your self to a Prosecution . Mr. Green . In our open Shops 't is thus ; - here 's new Goods for your old . William Clark , - Nash , William Gibbs , and Francis Kelborn , gave the Prisoner the Character of a very honest , industrious Man , and all of them never heard any ill of him in their Lives . Acquitted . 4. Joseph Wells , otherwise Weld . was indicted for stealing a silver Tankard , value 6 l. a Quart silver Mug , value 6 l sixteen Silver Spoons , value 8 l and two Silver Strainers , value 20 s. the Goods of William Barton , in his Dwelling-House , July 22 , 1734 . William Barton , I keep the Swan Tavern in Change-Alley . On a Sunday Evening , the 21st or 22d of July , 1734 , I was robbed of a Parcel of Plate , it was taken out of a Room behind the Bar ; I advertis 'd it , and on the Tuesday following 12 Spoons were brought from the Pawnbrokers ; I desired them to secure the Person that brought them if they could . About three Months after , Mary Spratley went to redeem the rest of the Spoons , and the Pawnbroker took her up : I lost sixteen Spoons , a Tankard , a Quart Mug , and two Strainers . Spratley carried a Silversmith 's Man with her to the Pawnbrokers , who was to redeem the Plate , and buy it of her out-right . She escaped from the Constable that Time , and the Silversmith came to me , and desired me to go with him to find out Wells the Prisoner ; telling me , the Plate came from him , and that he had bought the Tankard of him , which was mark 'd PBD We could not find the Prisoner then , for he was gone to Sea with Captain Braund , and Spratley was fled into the Country ; but hearing that Wells was return 'd to England , and that Spratley was in Town , I found her out , and she confessed she had these Spoons of Wells ; two of them were mark 'd EAD , and two of them WBA . The Prisoner brought these four Spoons to the Woman , himself . Zephaniah Crofton . I do n't remember any thing of Wells ; the Woman ( Spratley ) brought me these four Spoons , and pawned them in the Name of Mary Matthews , July 22 , 1734 , she had 16 s. upon two of them , and 15 s. upon the other two at two different Times . About the latter End of October , Spratley came with a Silversmith 's Man to redeem them ; I charged a Constable with her , and sent for Mr. Barton , but she escaped from the Constable , and I saw no more of her , till I saw her in the Compter about a Fortnight or three Weeks ago . Mary Spratley . Joseph Wells gave me the four Spoons tied with a Blue String , to pawn for him ; I was a Servant to him in his Mother 's Time , and after he broke I used to go of his Errands He directed me to Grafton 's , and bid me say they were for one Mary Matthews , who lay-in ; and , says he , they will make no Scruple of letting you have Money upon them ; this was about two Years and a half ago ; I pawn 'd them , and he had the Money ; it was 30 Shillings or thereabouts . He told me the Spoons had been there before , and I must take what they had before leat upon them . After I had given him the Money , he went to Sea . - Oh ! no , no , he was not gone to Sea , but was up and down . - He told me he was going to Sea with Captain Massey , but the Captain went without him He told me he had sold a Tankard in Whitechapel , and I must go with him there When we came to the Silversmith 's , Wells told him I had pawn 'd four Spoons , and desired his Man to go with me and redeem them , and then they should be sold to him . Q . How long was this after you had pawned them ? Spratley . God Almighty bless you ; I do n't know , about four or five Months I believe . I was to have a Crown of the Money , that I was indeed . The Silversmith could not send any Body with me then , but next Morning his Man and I went to redeem them , and the Pawnbroker sent for a Constable and charged him with me , and carried me to an Alehouse in Bunhill-Field , where some Gentlemen knowing me , got me into the Buffet unseen by the Constable , and so I escap 'd that Time . I lived two Years with him in his Mother 's Time as a Servant , and some Time I was with him otherwise , and now what a fine Scrape he has brought me into ? Prisoner . Ask her if I ever directed her to take the Silversmith 's Man with her , Thee or Thou ? Spratley . Yes , my Lordship , here is the Man that went with me . George Gibbs . I liv 'd at that time with John Lepar , a Silversmith , without Aldgate He has been dead about half a Year . I went with Spratley to the Broker to redeem some Spoons , and my Master was to have them at a Market-price . She said she had pawn 'd them for her Master Wells , who was under Misfortunes , and was then going abroad . She asked the Pawnbroker for the four Spoons , he desired us to sit down a little , and so he got a Constable and charged him with her . The Constable carry 'd us to the Angel in Bunhill-Fields ; the Broker went for the Prosecutor , and I went for my Master ; but when we came back the Prisoner had escap 'd . It is probable my Master might know something of Wells , for he had been a Neighbour , and kept a Cook 's Shop in Leadenhall-Street . Capt . Braund . The Prisoner behaved well , during the time he was on board with me ? Judith Bleeze . That Spratley was a wicked Woman in Leadenhall-Market , for she had a Warrant against me for striking her .

Jane Cooper , of Heston , Middlesex , was indicted , for that she being big with a Female Bastard Child , by the Providence of God , did bring forth the said Child alive ; and she the said Jane not having the Fear of God before her Eyes , & c. on the said Child so born alive , did , with both her Hands , make an Assault , and in a certain Linnen Cloth , value 1 d. the said Child did wrap , by Reason of which wrapping the said Child was then and there choaked and strangled ; of which choaking and strangling it there died . November 8 . Anna Maria Margaritta Church . Mary Eldridge told me she had a Bundle left her by the Prisoner , and she was offended with the Smell of it . I thought , as the Prisoner was a Servant to a Butcher , she might have bundled up a Joint of Meat , and so I advised Eldridge not to conceal it : So it was carry 'd to Heston Church House , and I was by when it was opened . There was in the Bundle a Shift and some Aprons , and a colour 'd Apron next the Child , which was a Female , and which the Prisoner own 'd to have been hers . She confess 'd she had given Eldridge the Bundle to keep for her , and had ordered her to let no Body see it . When she was going before Justice Bulstrode , I asked her if she had made a Provision for it , and she said , No , she had not , for she concealed it , and intended it should be concealed . Q . Did you ask her if it was born alive ? Church . She said it was not born alive ; she had made no Preparation for it , and that no Body knew any thing of it but her self . Mary Eldridge . Last Monday was three Weeks , the Prisoner sent for me , by an old Man , and told me she was going away from her Place , and desired me to take a Bundle to keep for her , ( whereof ) I did : She took it from under a Settle , and it was sew 'd up ; when she delivered this Bundle to me , she desired that no Body might see , or meddle with it . I thought it had been her own wearing Cloaths , so I put it up on the Head of my Bed , and there it lay till the Thursday following . I discovered it by the Stink that came from it , and acquainted my Neighbours with it ; we thought it smelt like stinking Meat , so it was open 'd , and we found something in it all over Maggots , Filth , and the like ; then we open 'd it farther , and found a Female Child . We acquainted the Officers , and they sent for the Prisoner to an Alehouse , who there own 'd she was deliver 'd of a still born Child by herself , at George Greenwood 's , where she liv 'd . The Child 's Arm was broke and its Skull too , and the Face of it was very much mortify 'd , which might be occasioned by its having been so long dead . Elizabeth Hutchins , Midwife . I was sent for by the Parish Officers to view the Child ; it was at its full Growth full nail 'd , and had Hair on its Head ; it was very much maul 'd , the Arm and the Skull were broke ; and as to the Face it had none ; no Eyes nor Nose , and the Skull was clasp 'd one Part over the other ; I can not say whether that might happen without Violence or not , but the Arm was broke between the Shoulder and the Elbow ; perhaps the clasping of the Skull one Part over the other , might be occasioned by her wrapping it up so close together . Defence . The Child was still-born , and never was alive in this World . I was delivered of the Child in my Service where I liv 'd , and I call 'd out , but nobody heard me , so as all was over and the Child was dead , I did not think of telling any Thing about it . Guilty . Death . She was indicted likewise on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder , and found guilty . 11 , 12.

William Wager , otherwise Corkey Wager , and Edward Baker , were indicted ( with William Eadey not taken ) for assaulting Samuel Lewis on the King 's Highway , putting him in corporal Fear , and taking from him one iron Key , value 1 d , a Nutmeg , value 1 d , a copper Ticket , value 1 d , 3 copper Medals , value 2 d , 3 pieces of Silver Coin , value 2 s. 10 d , 5 Guineas , 2 half Guineas , and 13 s. and 1d , in Money , the Property of Samuel Lewis , August 27 . They were a 2d time indicted for assaulting George Sleath on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear and taking from him 8 s. in Money , September 24 Samuel Lewis . August 27 I was coming from Woburn in Bedfordshire , in Company with a Gentleman and a Lady , and near Kentish Town in the Washy-Lane , I met four Horseman , one of them cry 'd , Hey ! I cry 'd , Hallo ! When I had rid a little Way down the Lane , Horsenail ( who was with them on a Grey Horse ) came up and turn 'd on my Horse 's Buttock . I went gently on , and he brush 'd past me and got before me ; Sir , says he , you must deliver your Money ; another of them said , By G - d , Sir , if you stir , I will blow your Brains out . Horsenail ( who stood before me ) had a Pistol , and he who was behind me held another to my Head . I had two or three Pistols about me at once , and looking behind me I saw the fourth Man stop a Gentleman in our Company under an Oak Tree , they took him to be my Servant because he had some Venison behind him , and was about twenty Yards behind me . I put my Hand in my Pocket and pulled out the Silver and these Pieces , which I gave to Horsenail . There was four of the Men in all , but I can not swear to either of the Prisoners ; one of them had his Face disguis 'd , but the Face of him that robbed me , was as bare as mine is now . I believe they are the Men , because some of my Pieces were found upon them . I gave them thirteen or fourteen Shillings in Silver , and a Silver Moidore , three Copper Pieces , and another Silver Piece , and another Shilling . These are the 3 Pieces which were taken from me ; one Silver Piece and two Copper Pieces besides ; these I put into the Man 's Hand that robbed me among the Silver , the rest of the Money he took out of my Pocket ; then the Man who was behind me said , he must search me . D - n it , says the other , he never rides without a Watch , look for it . I pulled up my White Waistcoat to get to my Pocket , and pulled out five Guineas and two Half Guineas . D - n it , says the other , look for his Watch , and he felt all round me . Sir , says he , I must take a little more care , and he felt all about me , and took a Nutmeg and a Key ; nay , he took every Thing from me but the Part he could not take . I beg 'd they would not meddle with the Lady ; no , says he , if any one meddles with her , I 'll shoot him through the Head ; and he bid her ride before , but she stood still . When they put their Hands into my Breeches , I began to swear at them . Pray do n't swear , says one of them , there 's nobody shall use you ill , we shall only take all the Money you have ; then he put his Hand into another Pocket where the Ticket was , and the five Guineas , and the Nutmeg , and the Key : The Gentlemen who was behind could not make his Mare stand still for want of her Company , on which Account they threatned to shoot him . When they had robbed me , they went to him and searched his Pockets ; d - n him , said they , he is no Footman , we must search him . When they had done , they cry 'd , Now do n't say we have us 'd you ill , and d - n you , if you had had a Bushel of Arms , they would not have signify 'd a Half-penny to you . I knew one of them , and when he was taken I knew him again . Wager . Mr. Lewis is not certain that Horsenail was one of the Company that robbed him ; when he came to New-Prison he said he knew Baker , but that he never knew me in his Life . Mr. Lewis . Baker has liv 'd in our Parish ten or twelve Years , he was behind with the other Gentleman about twenty Yards from me . He did come up with the rest of them to me , but he presently turned back and went to take Care of the Gentleman behind me . Q . Can you say you remember any Thing of Wager 's Voice ? Mr. Lewis . I believe them to be the Men , but Voices differ much . Baker . Mr. Lewis at New-Prison said , he should have known my Voice if he had heard it a Mile off . Thomas Walker I was in Company with Mr. Lewis and my Sister the same Time ; we were attacked by four Men on Horseback , one of them rid up to Mr. Lewis , but my Sister being forward ; he turned his Horse quick upon him , and asked him for his Money , presenting a Pistol at the same Time . Another of them came up and said , If he stirr 'd he would blow his Brains out . I was behind them , and the Mare I rode not standing still for want of her Company , one of them came to me and robb 'd me under an Oak Tree , about twenty Yards Distance from Mr. Lewis . D - n him , said one of them , He pricks his Mare , shoot him through the Head , so one of them staid with me while the others robb 'd Mr. Lewis , and prevented my riding back . When they had done with Mr. Lewis , they took about ten or twelve Shillings from me . Q . Did Mr. Lewis turn back to ride towards you , when they threatned to shoot you ? Mr. Walker . Yes , he turn 'd his Horse 's Nose to my Mare 's , to make her stand still . After they had robb 'd us they said , Now have not we us 'd you like Gentlemen ? D - n you , be gone about your Business and do n't look back . I endeavour 'd to conceal my Watch in my Hand , but hearing them say that Mr. Lewis had hid his Watch in his Hand , I slipp 'd it into my Coat Pocket and so I sav 'd it , this was done in the Washy-Lane , and they all rid off towards Kentish Town . I ca n't say I know any of the Men , I was then very much surpriz 'd , and the Man that robb 'd me hung down his Head under the Boughs . one of them had disguis 'd his Face , either with a Mask , or with Crape . I really believe the Prisoners are the Men , but I will not Swear to them . Baker 's Coat I took Notice of ; he had then such a plush Coat on under a riding Coat . Q . Have you any Reason to believe , that the Man who is a Witness , was one of the Company ? Mr. Walker . The Evidence , Horsenail , I believe , was the Person that robb 'd Mr. Lewis . Mr. Lewis . I know him to be one ; for he was some time searching me for my Watch , and felt all over my Breeches , and every where , where he might feel . Wager . I never saw him before in my Life but in New Prison , and he there declar 'd he did not know me neither . Baker . The Gentleman said in New Prison , he did not know me . Stephen Horsenail . The 27th , of Aug I was - Q . Consider you are upon your Oath , and tho ' you are one of the Persons guilty of this Fact , be cautious that you Swear nothing but what is true . Horsenail . I will : - On the 27th of August , I was in Company with the two Prisoners , and William Eadey , ( who is sled to Holland ) at the White-Lyon in Hornsey-Lane . About 6 o'Clock , ( or a little later ) in the Evening , we set out from thence , towards Battle-Bridge : We met some People on the other side the Turnpike , next London , and we robb 'd them . Several People coming from Barnet Races , we stopp 'd altogether , and robb 'd them likewise ; but we had robb 'd some People before we came to the Turnpike . There were a Dozen ( I believe ) in Company coming from the Races , and tho ' I can not say we robb 'd them all , yet I robb 'd one , and they robb 'd some of the rest . We were then going Home directly to Hornsey-Lane all in Company together . Eadey was on Foot when we set out , but we took a Horse from one of the Company we robb 'd , and then we were all mounted . In returning Home we pass 'd Mr. Lewis ; and Baker said to me . D - n you there 's your Mark ; then I turn 'd back and stopp 'd Mr. Lewis ; and Wager came up to the Head of his Horse directly , and assisted me in robbing him , by holding ( his Bridle in one Hand , and presenting a Pistol in the other ) I had a Pistol in my Hand when I stopp 'd him ; and I was the first that spoke to him . Sir , says I , you must stop ; I must have your Money ; then Wager came up to his Horse 's Head to assist me . Gentlemen , says Mr. Lewis , do n't use me ill ; you shall have my Money ! And pray do n't use the Lady , ill ! No , says I , if any Body offers to use her ill , I will shoot them thro ' the Head ; so I search 'd Mr. Lewis , and took from him , - I ca n't tell what directly , because we had been taking Money from others , but I believe - to the best of my Knowledge , it was about 6 l. in Gold and Silver , and those pocket Pieces which lye in Court . These 2 Pieces I gave to Mr. Barnes , when I was in Bridewell . Mr. Barnes . These are the Pieces I had from him there . Q . Did any of you touch the Lady ? Horsenail . No , no body at all . Q . Was any body in Company with Mr. Lewis beside the Lady ? Horsenail . Yes a Man , that we took to be the Footman ; and I said do n't rob the Footman . He was at some Distance behind Mr. Lewis , and Baker staid with him ; he did not care to come up to us , because Mr. Lewis knew him . Q . Did Baker take any Notice that he knew Mr. Lewis ? Horsenail . Yes , he did , when he said , D - n you there 's your Mark , and therefore he staid behind with the young Man . Q . Did Baker give that as a Reason why he would watch the young Man ? Horsenail Yes , my Lord , he did . Q . Who robb 'd the young Man ? Horsenail . Baker did . I saw him have the Money in his Hand , after we had robb 'd Mr. Lewis ; and he told us , he had got about 7 s. from him . When we had done with them , I wish 'd them a good Night , and said we had used them handsomely , and I hoped they would use us the same ; for we had not threat'ned them any farther than their Money . Q . After you had got your Booty , where did you meet . Horsenail . We went to the White Lyon in Hornsey-Lane , and there we shar 'd the Money ; the whole Plunder of the Day . Q . How much did you divide a-piece ? Horsenail . About fifty Shillings each our Dividend came to . I had two ; Baker had the Silver Piece which Mr. Lewis asked for when I was in New-Prison , and when I was before Justice Midford ; I had the Julius Caesar's 's Piece , and the Carolus XII . of Spain , but Baker had the Silver Moidore . When Mr. Lewis asked Baker for it , he told him it was gone to be gilt . The third Piece was lodg 'd in Ralph Guy 's Hands , who keeps the White Lyon in Hornsey Lane . Mr. Lewis . I had it from thence . Horsenail . I have at present a Key belonging to Mr. Lewis , which we took among the rest of the Things ; this is the very Key . [ pulling out a Key ] Mr. Lewis . This is the Key of my private Bureau , where I keep my Books ; this was in my Pocket with the Gold and the Nutmeg . Horsenail told me had it , but resolv 'd to keep it till the Day of Trial . Q . Did you make a Discovery of your Companions before you was Apprehended , or afterwards ? Horsenail . I was taken up on another Account about six Weeks ago , and I voluntarily discovered this Robbery before Justice Midford . I am sorry either , or any of us , should be so unhappy as to be in this State , but the Prisoners were indeed at the committing of the Fact . I have been concerned with them in this Way , but since the 24th of August last . Wager . I do n't doubt but Mr. Lewis was robbed , and suppose he was robbed by Horsenail and his Gang ; but I desire to know , whether he can produce any Gentleman of Credit who has seen us together on the Road ? Q . What , do you expect he should produce some Body who saw you together in a Robbery ? Wager . No , my Lord , only with Regard to this Robbery . Horsenail . Well then , I sent two Subpoena 's , one to Edward Tow , who let us through the Turnpike , and the other to Ralph Guy , who keeps the White-Lyon . Tow let us through the Turnpike , and knew what we were upon ; he said , indeed , he was sorry for our Courses . Ralph Guy . I keep the White Lyon in Hornsey-Lane , - Horsenail . This is the Man at whose House we shar 'd the Money . Q . Did you see ( to Guy ) Horsenail and Wager and Baker together at your House ? Guy . I have seen them together , but I ca n't say I saw them together , the Day this Robbery was committed ; they have been together at my House , sometimes ; but I have no Acquaintance with any of them : Baker I have known these 2 or 3 Years , he lived with a Gentleman whose Horses I us 'd to Shoe . I have seen them together several Times , this last Summer together ; they have drank at my House together . Horsenail . Who gave you the copper Peice , - the Ticket for the Kings private Road . Guy . Why - one of-them gave it me , and bid me give it my little Boy . - I had it from Eadey , I think it was . Q . Who gave you the other Pocket-peice ? Guy . I had it from Baker . Horsenail . You was present when we shar 'd the Plunder . Guy . I was always counted an honest Man . - I did see them telling Money , but I ca n't say what they were about . I saw them telling Money from one to the other , - there was Half-pence and Silver , I saw no Gold , - I did not I assure you . Horsenail . He knew of our going out , and when we came back he said it was pretty well , considering it was late when we went out . Did not we lie at your House that Night ? Guy . They were at my House all Night . Lewis . One of the Copper Peices I lost , had a String in it , I ask 'd about it , and Guy told me he had cut the String off . Guy . I had this Piece ( with the String ) of Baker , he gave it me , and at the same Time there was Wager , Baker , Horsenail , and Eadey , together . Horsenail . So we were ; and you saw the silver Moidore in Cockey 's Hand . Guy . No , - it was in Baker 's Hand ; but you were all Four together . Wager was Arrested for Debt ; he got from the Bailiffs and was conceal 'd at my House , but that was some Time before I saw this young Man . [ Horsenail ] Wager . Why Horsenail used to bring me Money , while I was conceal 'd at your House . Guy . Yes , - he used to come to my House when Wager was conceal 'd , - but I never saw him before he came to Wager . Eadey brought him to my House . Horsenail . Call Edward Tow . Q . You are the Keeper of the Turnpike ? Tow . Yes , I keep Battle-bridge Turnpike . Q . Do you know the Prisoners at the Bar ? Tow . Yes , my Lord , I have known one of them a pretty many Years ; the other I have but a small Knowledge of . Q . Do you remember whether you let the 2 Prisoners and Horsenail and Eadey , thro ' your Turnpike about the Time of Barnet Races . Tow . I ca n't remember a particular Day - I can not remember to have seen them come thro ' together in my Life , Horsenail would have persuaded me that I have . I have seen Baker come thro ' on Horseback by himself , but I do n't know that I have ever seen them together . Q . About July or August last have not you seen them come through a little Distance from one another . Tow . Not to my Knowledge . Horsenail . Please to ask him if he did not speak to Baker the Time that Mr. Lewis was robb 'd , and if he did not say he was sorry for our Way of living . Tow . Not to my Rememberance ; I do n't remember I did . Horsenail . Did not we meet you next Sunday Morning at the King's-Arms and Black-Mare ? And did not Baker tell you of it ? Tow . Not in my Hearing . Q . You Turnpike Keepers , often know that Men travel the Roads for these wicked Purposes , and conceal them . Horsenail . You have known me these 2 Years , tho ' not in this Way . Tow . I never Drank with you . James Barnes I am Headborough , and took Horsenail the 25th of October ( on Suspicion of another Robbery ) at Sir John Oldcastle 's . I brought him to the Vine Tavern , and took a Pistol out of his Pocket , and my Assistants found another upon him . I taxed him with being concerned in some Robberies , and he said , if I would use him well , and carry him before a Magistrate , he would discover his Accomplices . When he was before Justice Midford he made his Information , and I got Horses and Assistance and went directly to Epping-Forrest ; where according to his Instructions I searched 2 Barns for Baker and Cockey ; and going thro ' a Field to search another , I met Baker , and the Landlord of the House , to which the Barn belongs coming down the Field , about half a Mile from King's-Oak . I kick 'd up his Heels , and took from him a Pistol , a Blunderbuss and a Dagger . My Companions seiz 'd his Landlord , but he got from them , and is run away . I asked Baker where Cockey was , and he inform 'd us , he was in the Barn , about 10 yards from the Place where we took him . The Barn-door was Lock 'd , but I threw it off the Hinges ; we search 'd about , and in the Rafters over the Horses , there we found Cockey cover 'd with the Hay . We brought him down and Hand-cuff 'd him . Baker then asked if Horsenail was taken , and one of the Company told him yes ; upon that Wager quarrell 'd with Baker , and ask 'd what Business he had to Betray him . But D - n me , said he , I do n't care , we shall both be Jamm 'd together . Twas as much as we could do to get Wager Home , though I made a Man ride behind him , for he was very unruly , pulling the Horse about , making Motions with his Hands at every Body that it came near him , as if he was firing a Pistol , crying Phoo ! Baker was very quiet , and only said that Horsenail was a Rogue , and deserved to be hang 'd as much ( or as well ) as they did ; but Cockey was very uneasy , and curs 'd and swore bitterly , on the Road , and when we got to Town , the Mob was so great that I could not carry him directly to the Justices for fear of a Rescue , so I got them with much Difficulty to New-Prison , and the next Morning the Justice went to the Prison and examined them there , what they said upon their Examination I know not , for they were examined before I came down . Mr. Lewis , and I , and Baker , afterwards drank a Pint of Wine by ourselves , and Baker said to Mr. Lewis , I know I am a dead Man , for I had your Silver Moidore , 't is now gone to be guilded , but if the Man that has it do n't give it you , I 'll have him punished . He own 'd to us that he was the Man that cry 'd Hey ! and that Mr. Lewis cry 'd Hallo ! . He told us likewise that he had said to Horsenail , he would not have Mr. Lewis robb 'd , because he knew him . Q . Did he own to you who was in Company ? Barnes . Yes ; he said Wager , and Horsenail , and Eadey , were in Company together . When I went to this Guy 's House , he confess 'd they all had been together , and had often lain at his House ; and told us , that Cockey Wager had done so many audacious Things , that he had forbid him his House . C. The Gentlemen in the Commission will prevent his keeping a Publick House to harbour Highwaymen . Wager . I had been up by Four o'Clock that Morning , to get betimes to Waltham Market ; when I came back I was weary , and went up to rest me on the Hay , but about 8 o'Clock I was surpriz 'd , hearing a Noise in the Field , and hearing them breaking the Door ; so I got up , and said , what is it you want ? D - n you , we want you , and we 'll shoot you through the Head . I had no Arms , and came down directly Barnes . When I took him down and hand-cuff 'd him , he swore at Baker and d - n 'd his Blood , and told him if he had his Arms , and had been at Liberty , he would have drove us all to the Devil Owen Griffith . Barnes and I had a Warrant to apprehend Horsenail on Suspicion of a Robbery ; so we took him and carried him to the Vine-Tavern , and afterwards to Justice Midford , there he made a Discovery of several Robberies , and among the rest , of this Fact , in which he said Wager , Baker , and Eadey , were concern 'd . He told us where we might find Wager and Baker if we went directly . We set out between 11 and 12 at Night , there was Barnes , and I , and Thomas Rose , and one Garland . According to our Directions we went to the Waggon-and-Horses by Hound's-Field near Endfield-Wash , and from thence to this Barn , where , if we found such and such Horses , we might depend upon the Prisoners being there If we found them not here , we were to go to one Howlet 's , near King's-Oak . We put up our Horses at the King's-Oak , and were directed to the Barn , the People telling us if we went early in the Morning , we should certainly find them there , but if we were not upon them betimes , they would be gone to rob the Butchers on Rumford Road . We came to the Field where the Barn stood , and saw Baker coming down with his Landlord . Barnes went up to Baker and seized him , but the Landlord got away . Barnes took a Dagger out of his Breast , and one or two Pistols out of his Pocket . We ask 'd where Cockey was ; by G - d , says he , he 's in the Barn . We search 'd a Hay-Mow that was in the Barn , and God forgive me , I swore bitterly all the Time . Over the Horses there were some Poles laid , and a Truss or two of Hay upon them ; here I search 'd but could not find him . Barnes swore , and said , go up on the other Place ; I did , as soon as I got up , he ( Cockey ) cry 'd out for Mercy . But I have over-shot myself ; my Lord , I should have told you , that Horsenail having informed us that Baker carried a Blunderbuss about him , we ask 'd him for it , and he told us it was on his Right Side in a Pocket , and there we found it . There were some Expressions dropp 'd , as if Horsenail was a Rogue , and deserv 'd to be hang 'd . Q . Was Wager angry with Baker for betraying him ? Griffith Yes , he call 'd him Dog , I think , and said , if he had had Baker 's Arms , he would not have been taken . He might say something likewise of being jamm 'd together , but I did not take Notice of it . We had a very hard Struggle with the Mob to get them to Prison . Justice Midford came to examine them in Goal , but as he had been there a considerable Time before I came , I can give no particular Account of their Examinations , but Baker afterwards desired to speak with Barnes by himself , and the Discourse that passed between them was much as Barnes has related , for I listen 'd at the Door , and heard all that passed . Baker . I never said I was concerned in this Robbery , for I knew nothing of it ; and Mr. Lewis said before the Justice , that he did not know me . Benjamin Garland . Past 12 o'Clock , between the 25th and 26th of October last , Barnes , Griffiths , and Rose , came to my Bed-side and told me I must get up , they had something for me to do which would be for my Good . I went with them to Waltham-Abbey and to King's-Oak As we were going to this Barn , we met Baker and his Land-lord in the Field . Barnes seiz 'd Baker , and took from him a Pistol , a Hanger , and a Blunderbuss . Baker told us Cockey was in the Barn ; we search 'd the Hay , and thrust the Hanger into it ; at last I perceiv 'd him to stir , and I cry 'd out , Here he is ! and Griffths got up and took him . As we were bringing them to the King 's Oak , Wager said , D - n you , you Dog ( to Baker ) could you not be content to be hang 'd , without me , and called him very scurvilous Names ; but if I am hang 'd , says he , I have the Pleasure of having you hanged with me . Baker only shook his Head , and gave him no scurvilous Language again . Wager . I am sure I behaved myself very indecently , - decently I mean , and what they all say is entirely false As soon as they had taken us they said , now there was 280 l for us ; and one of them said , he would get himself a Marshal's-Court Officer 's Place with his Part of the Money . Thomas Rose . Barnes and Griffiths came to my House to be informed how they might take Horsenail , for he liv 'd just over-against my House ; I knew he was at Home , so we watch 'd for him and took him . Eadey and Wager us 'd to come to and from Horsenail 's Lodgings frequently . I was at the taking of Baker by Horsenail 's Directions ; and after we had taken the Hanger and the Pistol from him , we asked for a Blunderbuss , which Horsenail told us he generally carried about him ; he readily told us it was in his Great Coat Pocket , and there we found it . Wager curs 'd and swore bitterly all the Way we brought him along , d - ning Baker for a cowardly Dog , and telling him if he had his Arms , he would have made a devilish Sweep among us . One of our Company asked him , whether that would not have been a very barbarous Crime ? No , says Wager , 't is all one for that , I could but have been hang 'd . Wager . I liv 'd with Mr. Howlet seven Weeks , he is a Butcher , and he bid me get up that Morning and dress the Goods for Waltham Market , when I had done I was a-tyr 'd , so I got up in the Hay-Loft to sleep ; these Fellows came in , and said , G - d d - n you , if you speak a Word , we 'll shoot you through the Head ; I told them they were welcome to lay hold of me , so I surrendred and went very peaceably with them to New Prison . As to what they have said about my cursing Baker , with humble Submission , there 's none of them lives in Credit ; Rose keeps a bad House , and the others are Black-Guards . I hope your Lordship will consider what they have said . I have no Witnesses now , they were all here Yesterday . Q . And did not you yourself desire Yesterday to have your Trial put off untill this Morning ? Arthur Perkins , Richard Dennis , and Thomas Wright , appeared to Wager 's Character . William Savage , - Pantrey , and Thomas Dean , appear 'd in Baker 's Behalf . Guilty Death . William Wager , otherwise Cockey Wager , and Edward Baker , were a second Time indicted for robbing George Sleath , as above . George Sleath . I was coming from East Barnet the 24th of September , and upon Finchley-Common before 8 in the Morning , I was stopp 'd by the two Prisoners at the Bar , they had Pistols in their Hands , and demanded my Money , and bid me be quick . I put my Hand in my Pocket and gave them ten or twelve Shillings , and said , if they must have it , there it was . I kept Six-pence in my Right Hand , and desired them to leave me that to pay the Turnpike . I am positive to the two Prisoners , for I look 'd at them four or five Times , and they did not check me . Cockey took the Money , I delivered it into his Hands , and Baker , when I ask 'd for the Six-pence , said , well , well , let him have it . They d - n 'd me , and said , I had not given them all , so they searched my Breeches and my Fob , and then they rid away ; I am sure I carried the Thoughts of them in my Mind ever since , for they are very notify 'd . When they rode off , Baker said , d - n you , do n't tell any Body that you have been robbed , for if you do , the very next Time I meet you , I will shoot you ; but I rode not above half Way over the Common , before I told the People I met , that I had been robb 'd ; I thought I should know them again , and the Moment I saw them in New - Prison , I was sure they were the Men . Wager . I never robb 'd that Man throughout the whole Course of my Life . Baker . I never saw him before in my Life . Guilty , Death .

Francis Windsor , was indicted for stealing 59 Loaves of double refin 'd Sugar , value 11 l. the Goods of Sir William Chapman , and Thomas Emmerson , Esq ; in the Parish of St. Bennet Paul 's Wharf , Nov 6 And , James Powel , was indicted for receiving the same , knowing them to be stole . Dec. 6 . Mr. Phillipson . On the 8th or 9th of November , Mr. Emmerson shew 'd me the two Sugar Loaves in our Compting House , which he said were sold for 6 d. per lb . They were brought by Mr. Smith of St. Paul 's Church yard , and being apprehensive that they were ours , and that they had been stolen , he brought them down to us . We enquired the next Day after one Mrs. Fowles , who had sold these two Sugar-Loaves ; I went with a Constable to her House in Carter-Lane . I searched , and found nothing ; then I asked her about these Sugar-Loaves , which ( I was informed ) she had sold to one Middleton , and by Middleton to Mr. Smith ; and I asked her likewise , whether she had not sold Sugar-Loaves to one Humphries , at the Sugar Loaf in Fleet-Street , a Publick House ; she said she had seen Sugar-Loaves come into Humphries 's House . Upon this I got a Search-Warrant , and went there ; I asked him if he would let me search his House ; he said , with all his Heart . We went up and search 'd and I found 59 Loaves , which I can say are the Property of Sir William Chapman and Mr. Emmerson , for I know them by the Marks , some have T T. and some have C , upon them , and some have other Marks ; but I knew them all . I told Humphries they were dishonestly come by , and asked them whence he had them ? He said , he had them of James Powel . I told him he would stand a nasty Chance if he did not produce this Powel , and you will be prosecuted yourself . He told me Powel would be there that Evening . I said , I would attend his coming : But as I was going home , I remembered I had left my Handkerchief behind me , and returning to enquire for it , while I was there Powel came into the Yard ; I asked him how he came by the Loaves he had sold Humphries ; he said , very honestly . Says Humphries , you told me they were the Perquisites of several Boilers . After many Words , he confess 'd he had them of the Prisoner Windsor , our Boiler , but he said he bought them of him , and paid him for them . I ordered the Constable to carry him to the Baptist's-Head Tavern , and I sent for Mr. Emmerson ; I can not say what pass 'd between Mr. Emmerson and him , but by what pass 'd I saw that Windsor was concerned , and had confess 'd it . About Six o'Clock at Night Sir William 's Son . and I went again to the Tavern , and then Windsor call 'd us out into the Yard , and said , he had been ruin 'd by that old Rogue Powel , who had persuaded him to take Sugar-Loaves ; and that he receiv 'd them from him , knowing whose they were , and how he came by them . He said he us 'd to take them out of the Sugar House early in the Morning , and carry them to his own House , from whence Powel always fetch 'd them away in the Evening . This Powel , he said , had been an old Acquaintance of his , and meeting him in Fleet-Street , he asked him to give him a Bit of Sugar to sweeten his Tea ; in about a Fortnight after he gave him a Bit , and at different Times he own 'd he had taken about fifty whole Loaves ; that Powel had receiv 'd them all , and that he never had receiv 'd above two Guineas and a Half of him for them all . The same Confession Powel made before Sir Richard Brocas , and ask 'd his Master Pardon . Joseph Redshaw confirm 'd the above Evidence , with Regard to Windsor 's Confession . Mr. William Chapman . When we were at the Baptist's-Head , Windsor desired to speak with Mr. Phillipson and me , by ourselves : we went out with him into the Yard , and he told us he had wrong 'd the best of Masters , that the old Fellow had ruin 'd him ; and at Woodstreet-Compter he begg 'd we would be favourable to him . Then I went to Powel , and press 'd him to tell the Truth ; he confess 'd he never had any Sugar of any other , that he had receiv 'd all from Windsor , and had deliver 'd them all to Humphries ; he said he gave Windsor 2 s. 6 d. a Loaf , and sold them to Humperies for 2 s. 8 d. William Humphries . The Prisoner Powel has us 'd my House every Day these two Years . About six Months ago he brought some Sugar-Loaves to my House ( I keep the Sugar Loaf Alehouse in Fleet street ) and he asked me to buy them . He told me they were the Perquisities of Boilers , that he sold them for them , and got some little Matter by them himself . I took him for an honest Man , and bought several of him , and gave him 6 d. a lb . We always weigh 'd them at a Chandler 's Shop in Bride-Lane . After this I got them for a Guinea every seven Loaves , and seven Loaves generally weigh 'd 46 or 47 lb . sometimes 48 or 49 lb . sometimes he told me he brought them from Whitechapel , and ( says he ) 't is a very great Way . He told me I might have a Quantity of them for ready Money , as many of them as I would , and I did intend to go about them as they came so cheap , but Business prevented we . Q . Did he tell you where you was to have them ? Humphries . I did intend to ask him , and did resolve to go . Q . Did he name any Person he had them from ? Humphries . No . Q . Did he never name Windsor ? Humphries . No , he only said he had them from Boilers as their Perquisites . After he was apprehended , I said to him , You Villain , you have deceiv 'd me , you have done a pretty Piece of Work ; at last he confess 'd he had them from Windsor . We all went to the Baptist's-Head about three or four o'Clock , and Windsor was brought thither too . Windsor cry 'd out , Oh ! that I should be so bewitch 'd ! surely the Devil and old Powel bewitch 'd me , that I should wrong the best of Masters ! I ! that have had a Sufficiency to live upon with them - ! Powel heard this , and I call 'd him old Villain ! and old Rogue ! , but he simper 'd and smil 'd . - Why says he , do you take me to be a Rogue ! why did not you tell me a Lye , when you told me they were brought from White-chapel , says I . Yes , says he , I did . For what End , says I . For a Colour , says he . Oh ! says I , 't is a very fine Colour indeed . I ask 'd him afterwards the same Question , and he made the same Answer . Q . What would have been the Price of Sugar , if you had bought it out of the Shops ? Humphries . As I am on my Oath , I did not know , till the Day the Warrant came out against Fowkes and myself . Q . How many Loaves had you of Powel ? Humphries . I had at several Times fifty-nine and sixty-three , and I sold them again for 6 d. per Pound . Q . When you bought them for a Guinea every seven Loaves , and those Loaves weigh 'd but 48 lb . that was not above 3 s. Profit ; had you no more Gain upon them ? Humphries . I never made any Thing private ; I sold them in Publick , and Powel brought them in through the Tap-House , he would not come through the House , because he would not look like a Porter . Q . Did you tell People how you came by them ? Humphries . Yes , every Body ; I told them I had them of Powel , and that he had something for selling them for the Sugar-Boilers . Q . How many had you from Powel in all ? Humphries . In six Months I believe I have had 471 ; I believe it is six Months since I began to buy of him . Some I bought at 6 d. per lb . and some I gave 21 s. the seven Loaves . I sold sixty-three to Mr. Watson ; I had told him what I gave for them , and he bidding me 6 d. per lb . I said he should have them Q . This Man was the proper Person to have been prosecuted . Sir William Chapman . When the Prisoners were taken up , Windsor begg 'd for Mercy , and confessed he had sold our Loaves to Powel . I asked Powel what he gave for them , and he told me 2 s. 6 d. or 3 s. a-piece : I said , surely you may remember the Price , and at last he said it was but 2 s. 6 d. and that he had 2 d a-piece for carrying them In the Compter . Windsor said , he he had never sold Powel above fifty Loaves : says I , Powel charges you with a greater Number . He said if he did , it was not Fact . Then I went to the other Compter to examine Powel . Justice Harwood was with me , and examining him closely , he said , he had given Windsor 18 d. a Loaf , and had sold them for 3 s. Q . When he said he had bought them for Half a Crown a Loaf , did he speak to any particular Number ? Sir William Chapman . No , he only spoke in general ; and the second Time , when he said he had given 18 d. and sold them for 3 s. the Words were general . He said he gave Half a Guinea for seven Loaves , and 9 s. for six . Mr. Emmerson . I desired to know the Truth of the Matter ; and when Powel begg 'd for Mercy , I said , if he would be ingenuous and tell the Truth , Mr. Chapman would indulge him , and he might have Mercy . Upon that he confessed he had sold above an Hundred to Humphries , and that he had them all from Windsor , and gave him 18 d. a-piece for them . Q . Was Mr. Chapman present , when you made these Promises of Mercy to him ? Mr. Emmerson . Yes , and he did not contradict them . Windsor 's Defence , Sir . William Chapman . When this Thing was discovered , we were all amaz 'd , for we thought Windsor a very honest Fellow ; nay , we had such an Opinion for him , that when we left working at some of our Sugar-Houses , and consequently reduc 'd the Number of Hands which we employ 'd , we turn 'd away an old Servant , and put him into his Place at this Bake-House at Paul's-Wharf . Henry Hunt , John Brushwood , Walter Jones , Robert Beancock , John Hind , and David Scotland , gave Windsor the Character of a very honest industrious Man . Powel 's Defence . Thomas Carr . I am Lord Palmeston 's Steward , my Lord is at Bath , he would have appear 'd in Mr. Powel 's Behalf himself , but he ordered me to appear for him He liv 'd many Years in my Lord 's Service as his Butler , and had the Custody of all the Plate , and we never had any the least Reason to mistrust him . He has left our Service between nine or ten Years ; he is still made very welcome whenever he comes to our House , and needed not to have left my Lord 's Service had it not been his own Fault . He is about 75 or 76 Years old , and imagin 'd himself uncapable of doing Business as he formerly had done . Thomas Edmonds , Peter Grace , John Shipton , and Adam Savory , gave Powel the Character of an honest innocent Man . Windsor guilty 4 s. 10 d. Powel acquitted . [ Branding . See summary . ] 24.

Nov. 27 . They were a second Time indicted for stealing a Black Stone-Horse , value 25 s. the Property of Cornelius Oakley , Nov. 27 . William Bickerstaff . November 27 , between 10 and 2 in the Morning , I was going Home with my Team , and was loaden with Manure for my Land ; Owen and the rest of the Prisoners came up , and violently unhook 'd the Horse from the rest , saying they would have one of my Horses . I lay 'd hold of Owen , and call 'd out to the Bellman ( who happened to be going his Round ) to come to my Assistance : after he came up , the other Prisoners fell upon me and beat me with their Fists and with Sticks , because I would not part with my Horse . Allen , Addison , Spicer , Roberts , and Owen , were all together in the Fact . I was over-power 'd by them , and they had got my Horse away about forty Pole , but the Bellman prevented their carrying him off ; the Pretence they made , was , that I had got seven Horses , and they swore they would have one . John Hobbs . I desired them to tell the Horses , they said they would not , but swore , that they would have one of them Right or Wrong Owen took the Horse off , and the rest of the Prisoners assisted , and carried him away about forty Pole , but Thomas Huntley the Bellman , got us the Horse again . Thomas Huntley . I was doing my Duty , and hearing a Quarrel , I came up to see what was the Matter , and I found the Prisoners had got one of the Man 's Horses , and were carrying him away by Force . We had them all before the Justice , and there they pretended they had an Act of Parliament for what they had done . Q . At two o'Clock in the Morning they were carrying the Man 's Horse away by Vertue of an Act of Parliament ! Do you imagine they would have gone off with him , if you had not come up ? Huntley . Yes . Another Witness . I was there at the same Time ; when I came up they were all struggling about the Horse . I bid Owen let the Horse alone ; he said , ask no Questions , I will have him , but thro ' Assistance , we got him again . Owen . We had an Act of Parliament to take Horses , and were encouraged by a Justice of Peace . We condemn 'd a Horse before Justice Exeter , but a Day or two before . - Canes . There was no more than six Horses , and because I assisted the Farmer , they beat me till I was all over Blood . Second Indictment . Cornelius Oakley . I lost a Black Stone-Horse the same Morning about one o'Clock ; I had six Horses in my Team , and a loose Horse which I rode upon , but he had a Collar and Chains upon him . Owen got upon his Back , and said he would knock my Brains out if I would not let him go off . My Neighbour 's Waggon coming by , they took a Horse from him , but as they were overpowered , I got mine again , but they had led him quite away . I can swear to all the five Prisoners , there was six of them in all , one Kimpton was with them , but he is got off . Canes . I heard the Sticks fly about and I went to assist my Master . Owen keeps a Publick House , the Sign of the Cock at Prickler's-Hill , between Barnet and Whetstone . They are all People that do n't love Work . Another Witness . I drove the Waggon , and swear there were no more than six Horses in the Team : All the Prisoners were there . Mr. Justice Smith I was call 'd up early in the Morning some People who pretended to take Horses from Waggons drawn with seven Horses ; several Neighbours testify 'd these were drawn but with six . They had beat the People very much , and would have sworn the Waggons were drawn with seven Horses ; but as People of Credit had sworn there were but six , I did not think proper to give them their Oaths , and committed the Prisoners for an Assault . Q . By what Authority did you do all this ? Owen . By an Act of Parliament . The Act was read , which enacts , That if any Seizure or Distress is made on Persons travelling with more than six Horses , the Horse so seiz 'd shall be deliver 'd into the Hands of the Constable nearest the Place where such Seizure is made , safely to be kept till the Person or Persons , who made such Distress , prove the Offence before a Justice of the Peace , who is empower 'd ( on Proof of the Offence ) to order the Delivery of the Horse or Horses so seiz 'd , for the Use of the Distrainer . Bickerstaff . I was going with Manure to my own Grounds . Oakley I was loaded with Deals and other Things . Bickerstaff . Mine was not a hired Waggon , and had no more than six Horses . Canes . It was our Desire that the Horses should be deliver 'd to the Bellman . Huntley . The Owners of the Horses did desire it , but the Prisoners were for carrying them away . All acquitted . 33 , 34.

James Lyon . About Eight o'Clock at Night , Nov. 29 , I had just got through the Bars at Smithfield , when I was seized on one Side by the Prisoner , and a Man took hold of me on the other Side , and they said they must have my Money . I was going to lift up my Voice , and to call out aloud , but the Man seized me by the Throat and prevented me . He held me thus , while the Woman opened this Pocket and took a Knife and 3 s. and 1 d. and a Farthing from me . The Man ask 'd her , if she had got it , and held me a little while that she might get off ; but I followed her to a House in Charterhouse Lane , - I know her to be the Woman . Q . How do you know the Prisoner to be the Woman ? Lyon . The Lamps gave a good Light , and I followed the Man and she too into the House . Q . And did these two People who had robb 'd you , suffer you to follow them into a House ? Lyon . The Man struggled very hard against my coming into the House ; but the Landlord said - let the Gentleman come in : So I went in , and he asked me if I would please to go up Stairs and drink a Bottle of China Ale , and have a pretty Girl . The House is not above 20 or 30 Rods from the Place where I was robb 'd , and the Landlord is a Rabbit Man . Q . So the Man that robb 'd you , let you follow him into the House ; is this the Case ? Lyon . That is the Case ; and that is the Woman that took my Money . Q . So the Man and the Woman that robb 'd you , went into the Rabbit-House , and you followed them into the Rabbit-House . Lyon . Yes ; and I saw four Men and four Women there , so I was glad to get out again ; but I went and got a Constable and took them The Constable . He came to me and said he was robb 'd between Smithfield Bars and Charter-house-Lane , and gave the same Account of the Fact , and of what he lost . He desired me to go to this Rabbit House , but I told him there was a Constable and a Headborough lived on each side of the House , and it would be better for him to get either of them to go with him : He desired I would go , and at last I went with him ; but going down the Lane , he catch 'd hold of the Prisoner and charged me with her . Upon this , Pendall the Rabbit-Man came up , and bid him let the Woman go Did not you come into my House , says he , and drink a Bottle of China Ale ? And did not I give you 3 d. out of your Shilling ? But at last Pendall said he would give the Prosecutor what he had lost , if I would discharge the Prisoner . Q . If he was so positive to the Man and the Woman , why did not he take you to the House , and charge you with the Man ? Constable . The Man was gone , he said . Q. Pray Mr. Lyon who are you ? Have you any Persons here to give an Account of you when you come to take a Life away , and entitle your self to 14 l. I expect something more than this Story . Defence . This Lyon turn 'd upon me in the Street , and pull 'd me by the Sleeve , so we came down together to the Rabbit-House , and went up Stairs together ; we had a Bottle of China Ale , and I had no more from him than a Groat all but a Farthing . He swears this against me because I would not oblige him , - no says I , if you give me 3 d. three Farthings to make a Whore of , I will keep it to make my self honest Q . Here , Lyon , was not you in Drink at this Time ? Lyon . No ; tis well known I was not I had been at Supper at Mr. Gardner 's , at the White-Horse in Castle Alley : I was not up Stairs with her at all . Acquitted . 38.

Mrs. Goddard I lost a Piece of stripp 'd Cotton , and a Piece of Check , Oct. 7 , the Value of them is about 4 s - Cook . About two Months ago ( I ca n't remember the Day ) we robb 'd the Prosecutor 's Shop in Moor-Street , by St. Ann 's . The three Prisoners and I had attempted it several times ; but at last we found an Opportunity to do it ; for about Seven or Eight o'Clock at Night I lifted up the Sash and took out the Check . I was not content with that , so we all return 'd and fetch 'd twenty Yards of Cotton . We carry 'd it to Ann Hill 's House ; she pawn 'd it for 21 s. and we equally shar 'd the Money in her Room . This David Brown , lost his Great Coat , we stole it : Pell was taken up about it , and I was catch 'd in the very Coat my self . David Brown . Coachman . I was waiting in the Street for Capt . Powel , and fell asleep in the Bottom of my Coach ; when I 'wak 'd , my Coat was gone from off my Coach-Box . I was inform 'd by a Lad that Pell and this Evidence had been lurking about the Coach , so I pursued them and took Pell , and about a Week afterwards Cook was taken , and he made himself an Evidence and discover 'd this Robbery . John Preston . I took Pell for stealing Brown 's Coat ; he own 'd that Cook took the Coat and pawn 'd it for 4 s. 6 d. and that he had half the Money . Afterwards I apprehended Cook , and he was admitted an Evidence . All Guilty 4 s 10 d. Gerrard Pell and John Lowder , were a second Time indicted for stealing a Silver Cup , value 42 s. the Goods of John Dickins , in his Dwelling-House , Aug. 9 . And 42. Ann Field , otherwise Taylor , otherwise Pritchard , for feloniously receiving the same , knowing it to be stole , August 10 . John Dickings . I live in Brook-street , Grosvenor-Square ; on Monday the 9th of August about nine at Night , I was at Supper in a Ground Room , and all of a sudden I saw the Window Curtain and a Silver Cup which stood in the Window was gone ; I run out , but could hear no Tidings of it , only we found a little old Hat , which the Evidence Cook said was his . Cook . Pell and John Lowder and I , committed this Robbery ; I saw the Sash a little open , and some Body in the Room , but seeing the Cup in the Window I ran to the Prisoners , and told them there was something we must have ; so I push 'd the Sash up a little higher , and watch 'd till the Maid was gone out of the Room ; then I snatch 'd up the Cup , and away I ran with it . We sold it to Ann Field who lives by Hicks's-Hall , and she knew it to be stole . We asked her two Guineas for it , but she said she would give but one for it , because it would cost her something to melt it down , and she should have a good deal of Trouble to make away with it . I gave a Man that us 'd to deal with her in this Way , Half a Crown to shew me where she liv 'd . I had been at Bess Anderson 's who buys our Handkerchiefs , to know where I should sell this Cup , and this Man happening to be there , he carried me to the Prisoner Field 's , she would not weigh it , because she would not give too much Money for it . Dickins . I had a Direction from Cook , where this Woman liv 'd ; so I took two Friends , one of them is a Constable , and we went in and called for a Pint of Beer ( she keeps a Publick House ) then we asked for the Mistress of the House ; she came to us , and we enquir 'd if her Name was not Field . Yes , said she . Then said I to the Constable , here 's your Prisoner . Oh ! but , said she , my Name is not Field , my Name is Pritchard , and she called several People and asked them if her Name was not Pritchard , and they all said yes . She told us then she knew where this Field liv 'd , and would go and fetch her ; so she turn 'd herself round and away she ran , and we lost her , though one Man stood at one End of the Court , and another at the other , to prevent her escaping ; this was on Friday , and she was not seen 'till 11 or 12 o'Clock on Sunday Night . A Person I had employ 'd to watch , sent me Word he had heard a Noise in the House , so I got a Constable about one o'Clock , and found her packing up all her Goods in order to be gone . Field . Field is none of my Name , and as for that Fellow , I never saw him in my Life . Cook the Evidence came to my House , and ask 'd for Mary Jones , and the Woman and he went into a Room together , and they had a Quartern of Brandy and a Pint of Beer together . N. B .

James Smith . About Nine o'Clock on Monday Night , November 8 , I was walking along Great Russel Street , and was attack 'd by two Men under Mountague House , near the Gateway . One of them struck me on the Breast with his Fist , and bid me deliver ; the other immediately seiz 'd my Hanger , drew it out of the Scaboard , and held the Point of it to my Breast : They bid me make no Noise , if I did , I was a dead Man . I desired them not to use me ill , and told them I would give them what Money I had about me : They made no Answer to this , but one of them took hold of the String of my Watch , and pull 'd it out of my Fob . I believe they are the Men , but I can not take upon me to swear to them . I apprehend that Campbell ( the shortest of the Prisoners ) was the Man that took my Watch , and the ten Guineas and a Key : He held the Money in his Hand , and by the Light of the Moon , look 'd to see how much he had got . I desired them to return me the Key , and they did so : When they had rifled me , they bid me pick up my Cane ( which I had dropp 'd ) and then they went over on the other side of the Way . I look 'd in the Face of the Man that struck me ; but when the other presented the Hanger 's Point to my Breast , I was afraid to give them Offence , by looking earnestly at them . As they were crossing the Way , I ask 'd them for my Hanger ; they bid me not make a Noise , if I did , they said they would return and murder me . Q . Can you take upon you to swear that the Prisoners , or either of them , are the Men ? Mr. Smith . I can not ; they were very expeditious , in their Work , and I had not time , while they were robbing me , to take particular Notice of them . I went to the Printer of the Daily Advertiser , and described the Watch , promising a Reward of five Guineas for it again ; and Notice was brought me from Mr Goddard , who keeps the Crown at St. Giles 's , that the Prisoners were taken that Night I went to Mr. Goddard , and he inform 'd me that he had found the Goods upon the Prisoners . The next Day we carry 'd them before Justice De Veil , and the Hanger , Watch , and Seal , which were found upon them , were produced . I can not swear to the Prisoners , but I swear that the Hanger , Watch and Seal , are mine . Q . Had you any Discourse with them then , or afterwards ? Mr. Smith . No ; they were brought from the Gatehouse to the Justice 's , that I might see them ; but I could not swear to them . Campbel . Nothing was found upon me but the Money ; I desire to know whether the Gentleman will swear to that : I had nothing but the Money upon me . Mr. Smith . No , I ca n't swear to Money . Francis Waker . I had a Warrant from Justice De Viel , against Campbel and another Man , for stealing a Gold Watch , and I took him up on that Account ; I carried him to Mr. Goddard , at the Crown Alehouse , and asked him about the Gold Watch , says he I can help you to two or three Man , for I have just now made a Watch , and have tipp 'd George Sutton a Hanger and the Loge . Since I am babbl 'd myself , I will babble two or three more , and he nam 'd two or three more , and directed us to the Cole Yard . but we found only George Sutton there , though he told us we should find two or more there . When we seiz 'd Sutton we searched him , and found the Hanger in his Bosom . Then we brought him to Mr. Goddard 's , and put Sutton in one Room , and Campbel in another ; says Campbel , search Sutton again , for I am sure he has got the Loge ; we searched him again , and found the Watch in his Breeches , under his Ham . Campbel went with us to the Cole yard , and shewed us the House where we found Sutton . Q . Is that the Hanger that was taken from Sutton ? ( to Waker . ) Sutton . Yes , yes , - he 'll swear it no Doubt . Waker . When we felt the Watch in Sutton 's Breeches , he said , come , come , I 'll give you no more Trouble , - I 'll give it you , but it would have served to have kept me in Newgate Sutton . You are a for-swearing Rogue . C. This Behaviour do n't become you , when a Man is swearing in a Court of Justice , what so much affects you . Waker I believe this is the Hanger ; I did not take so much Notice of the Watch as I did of the Hanger . Mr. Goddard took the Watch out of Sutton 's Breeches , and he did not deny the Fact at all , but said , - now since Bob the Glazier has serv 'd me , I will serve him ; go search him again , for he has got a Lump of Gold about him , and tell him he 's a Rogue if he do n't send me some to keep me in Newgate . Upon this we search 'd Campbel again , and found ten Guineas in the Foot of his Stocking ; we took off one Shoe , and he readily let us do it , but when we attempted the other , he fell down on one Knee , and said , No , I will lose my Life before I will be search 'd any further ; you may hang me or do what you please , you shall not have a Farthing of the Money . We did not know who the Goods belong 'd to , till we saw the Advertisement . Sutton . That Rogue will swear thro ' an Iron Bar . Waker . We put the Prisoners into our Round House for that Evening , and next Morning we carried the Watch , the Hanger , and the Money , to Justice De Veil , and took the Prisoners before him ; I was one that went with them , and Sutton told me he forgave Bob with all his Heart , and wish 'd he could make himself an Evidence , but I believe he can not , because this is the first Fact I have committed with him since I return 'd from Transportation . Mr. Smith was present , and swore to his Goods , though he could not to the Man . Campbel . About three Years ago this Fellow stopp 'd me in the Street , and cut me in the Face in six or seven Places , and carried me before a Justice , - I carried him before a Justice , and one Attley paid me eight Guineas for the Case . Waker is a common Thief-taker . Q . And does he take none but Thieves ? William Goddard . Mr. Waker , and Attley , and one Cook , brought Campbel into my House on Monday Evening November 8 , about Ten at Night . I keep the Crown Tavern at St Giles 's Pound , they were together a little Time , and then Mr. Waker came out to me , and said , they were going to do Business , - to take some Fellows , and they should be glad of my Assistance ; we all went out and Bob the Glazier with us . According to his Directions we went first to Covent Garden , and from thence to the Cole-Yard by Drury Lane ; Campbell said , Sutton was at such a House , and pointed at it ; we went into the House , and behind a Door , up one Pair of Stairs , there sat Mr. Sutton with his Hand in his Bosom . I put my Hand upon his , and said , George , I have it , - make no Words ; and finding the Hanger drawn , I took it from him , it was without a Scabbard , but he had bound his Garter round the Blade . I then search 'd his Pockets , and took a Clasp Knife from him . From hence we carried him to my House , and put Sutton in one Room and Campbel in another . Campbel ask 'd me , if I had search 'd Sutton , and assured me he had got the Watch about him at that Time . I said , - I have search 'd him , and surely he can not have it . He has , said he , and I 'll shew you how I robb 'd the Man . Upon this he took me by the Breast , and up went his Stick , and he shew 'd me very well how it was done . I drew his Hanger , said he , and pull 'd his Watch out of his Fob thus - [ at the same Time pulling my Watch from my Pocket ] this was to shew me in how small a Space of Time , the Fact was done ; the Watch and the Hanger he said he had given George Sutton , and the Money he had taken himself . After Campbel had given me this Account , I went into the Kitchen to Sutton , and said to him , George , you have got the Watch , 't is in vain to make Words , have it I must : he swore he had it not , but I would search him , and in his Breeches , under his Right Ham , I found it ; I was going to unbutton his Breeches , he said he would give me no more Trouble ; so he put his Hand into his Breeches , and pull 'd it out himself . When I had got it , he desir 'd I would let him look at it , for he had never taken any Notice of it since it had been taken ; I let him see it , and he said it was a very pretty Thing , and delivered it to me again , and I have had it in my Possession ever since . You ca n't blame me , said he , for endeavouring to conceal the Watch , for it would have kept me in Newgate ; but go and tell Campbel to send me a Guinea or two , for he has got all the Gold . Waker . I ask 'd Campbel ( by way of Pump ) whether he had got any Gold for Sutton ; and he said , if he had his Hat full of Guineas , he would send him none . Owen Griffith . I live in Middle Row , St. Giles 's . Within three or four Yards of my Door , Mr. Attley and Waker stopp 'd Campbel , and I being a Constable , they charg 'd me with him . I took him into my Shop and search 'd him for Arms . He said he had none , and would go ( very civilly ) with us any where . I took him to Mr. Goddard 's at the Crown , and went into a Room behind the Bar with him . After some few Words had pass 'd , he desir 'd to speak with Waker by himself ; we went out , but presently we were call 'd in , and were informed , that Campbel would make a Discovery of Something if we would go with him . Campbel told us all ; that Sutton and he had just committed a Robbery by the Dead Well at Bloomsbury , or Great Russel Street , I do n't remember which ; that he had tipp 'd George the Hanger and the Loge , we took the Loge to be a Pistol , but it prov 'd to be a Gentleman 's Watch . We took Mr. Goddard with us to search after Sutton , first at a Place on this Side Covent-Garden , where there us 'd to be a Gin-shop ; but not finding him there , we went to a private House in the Coal-Yard , where ( I think ) Campbel knock 'd at the Door , a Woman answer 'd within , and he spoke to her again ; upon which she opened the Door , and he whisper 'd to her , and swore an Oath , and told us George was within and behind such a Door . Mr. Goddard , and I , and Waker , rush 'd in ; Goddard clapp 'd his Hand on Sutton 's Breast , and cry 'd out , I have got it ; he pulled it out of his Bosom and I cut the Garter which was bound round the Blade ; then I search 'd his Pockets , for fear he should have Pistols about him , but I found none . Campbel having talk 'd of the Loge , and I imagining the Loge was a Pistol I thought proper to search him narrowly for fear of Mischief . From hence we carried them both to Mr. Goddard 's , and Campbel was put into the Back Room , and Sutton into another . Campbel ask 'd us what we had taken from Sutton ? Some of us said , a Hanger and a Knife . Why , says he , I gave him the Watch which I took from the Gentleman . Upon that Goddard insisted on searching Sutton farther ; and when he found we were resolv 'd to search him thoroughly , he took the Watch out of his Breeches himself , desiring only to look upon it , for , says he , I have never look 'd upon it yet . We shew 'd it to him , and he said it was a very pretty Thing , Campbel was a Villain for discovering the Watch , it would have serv 'd to have kept me in Newgate , but since he has us 'd me thus , go and tell him he had a Handful of Gold from the Gentleman . This occasion 'd our searching Campbel again for the Gold : he profess 'd he had none , and began to throw his Cloaths about him , but I would pull off his Shoes , and the Right Shoe he let us take off very quietly , but when I endeavour 'd to take the Left , he fell down on his Knee , and swore , if he had a Hat full of Guineas , we should not have one of them though we kill 'd him ; but while the other three Men held him , I pull 'd off his Stocking and turn 'd ten Guineas out of it upon the Table . Here they are , and these are the very Guineas which I pour 'd out on the Table . When we found the Money , both the Prisoners seem 'd to be positive that there must have been more . Sutton said he thought there had been a Broad-Piece among the Gold , but afterwards he told us , that as he only saw the Money by the Light of the Moon , perhaps he might be mistaken . I told Bob I was surpriz 'd how they could do such a Thing in so little a Time , and so early in the Evening . Why , says he , I can do such a Job in half a Minute 's Time , and shew 'd us the quick Manner in which he did it . Campbel . Well , now where 's Attley ? Is not he a Witness too ? Attley ! you are not asham 'd to shew your Face Sutton . I have nothing to say , nor any Body to call . George Clark , a Glazier in Covent Garden , and William Rextrove , a Cabinet-maker in Thrift Street , Soho-square , appeared in Behalf of Campbel , but neither of them could give any Account of him for these 7 Years last past . Both Guilty . Death . 57. Hannah Butler , of St. Andrew 's , Holbourn , was indicted , for that she being big with a certain Female Bastard Child , by the Providence of God she did bring forth the same alive , but not having God before her Eyes , & c. on the said Child , so born alive , did , with both her Hands , make an Assault , putting it into a certain Wooden Box , value 2 d. and covering it with a certain Stuff Gown , value 6 d. by Reason of which Putting and Covering , the said Child was choak 'd and strangl 'd , of which Choaking and Strangling , it instantly dy 'd ; and so the said Butler , the said Child , did , of her Malice afore-thought , kill and murder . She was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Oct 29 . John Butler . The Prisoner was a Servant at my Brother 's , the Ship , in Gray's-Inn-Lane ; on Lord Mayor 's Day I heard a Disturbance ( for I lie in the next Room to where the Prisoner lay ) - I heard an Out-cry that she had made away with her Child ; the Women desired us all to hunt about for it . I search 'd the Vault with a long Stick , but could find nothing ; then I went into her Room and broke open her Box ; the first Thing I found in it , was a Pint of Gin , then there was a green Stuff Gown , and under this Gown lay the Child ; the Box was lock 'd , but I broke it open with a Cleaver , such as you chop Meat with . I saw the Child , but I do n't know what it was , - Boy or Girl ; it was naked , but I was not curious enough to examine it . The Gown covered the Child , and the Gin Bottle lay upon that : I ran down Stairs and told the Women who were examining her ; - I do n't know what the Prisoner said to the Women for I was not present . But I heard her say when she was before the Justice , that the Child was her 's , and she stroak 'd it upon the Breast , and said it was born dead about five o'Clock in the Morning . Robert Butler . The Prisoner liv 'd with me as a Servant , and on the 29th of October there was a Disturbance about her having had a Child ; my Brother searched for it and found it . She was carried before a Justice , and there she owned it was her Child , and that she was delivered of it dead , about five o'Clock in the Morning . Margaret Butler . There is a Porter who belongs to Gray's-Inn , who lives up two Pair of Stairs , - she lies in the Garret , - and he bid me go up and examine my Maid , for she was not well . When I went up , I found some Disorder , and that she had been deliver 'd . She said she was not deliver 'd , but that she was then in Labour . I sent for my Midwife , and she examined and found that the Prisoner had been deliver 'd . I asked her if she had got any Thing to put the Child in . She told me no ; and then she said she had miscarried at a Vault in the Alley ; but when the Child was found she owned it was her 's , and that she was delivered of it about five in the Morning ; it was a Female Child , and there were no Marks of Violence upon it , except a Spot upon one Cheek . She confessed to us that she had made no Preparation for it , but at the Justice 's she said , she had got one of a Sort . I thought she looked big when she had been in the House two or three Days , and I asked her if she was married . No , says she , I am not married , I am only Pot-belly 'd , all our Family are Pot-belly 'd , - and what a Disgrace it is to be Potbelly 'd ! Ann Lee , Midwife , and Elizabeth King , confirmed the former Evidences . Defence . The Child was dead born , and I being willing to keep it to myself as well as I could , put it into the Box intending to go into the Country again . Acquitted . 58. Gilbert Fruer , otherwise Gill , was indicted for assaulting Benjamin Short in an open Field near the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Hat value 12 d. a Cloath Coat value 10 s. a Linnen Shirt value 3 s. a Pair of Leather Breeches value 3 s. a Pair of Shoes value 2 s. a Knife value 2 d a Foot Rule value 6 d. a Silver Stud value 6 d. and 14 d. Half-penny in Money , Nov. 23 . Benjamin Short . November 23 I was coming from Highgate , and between the Half Way-House and Tottenham Court , I was met in the Foot-way , between five and six in the Evening , by two Men , one of them laid fast hold of my Shoulder , and the other took me by the Right Arm ; they carried me out of the Path as far as Mr. Lewis 's Field , and under a Hedge I submitted to them . They demanded my Money and my Watch , I told them they should have what I had got , if they would not use me ill . The Man that seiz 'd my Right Arm , pulled out a Pistol and held it to me while the Prisoner rifled me . He pulled off my Coat , - 't was a Blue cap 'd Coat , - and my Shirt , and my Breeches from my Backside , and my Shoes from my Feet : Then they made me untie my Garters ( which were these ) and I gave them to him ; these wo n't do , says he , so he pulled off his own ( which were these . ) When they had pulled off my Shirt , my Shoes , and my Breeches , they ty 'd my Hands together with these Garters behind me ; the Prisoner ty 'd me and the other stood over me with a Pistol ; after that they pulled up my Left Leg behind me , and ty 'd it very hard to my Hands : I had a Silk Handkerchief about my Neck which the Prisoner took off and put into his Pocket ; then he took this out of his own , and ty 'd it very close over my Mouth . I had 2 s. and Three Half-pence about me , and they took it all from me ; there was a Pair of Silver Studs in my Sleeves , one of them they took away in the Shirt , and the other dropt on the Ground . After they had bound me , they desired me to be quiet ( and indeed I could not be otherwise they had tied me so fast ) telling me , the first Man they took they would come and release me ; so away they went and left me . I lay near an Hour in this Condition , - the Wind blue very cold , and I had no Breeches nor Shirt ; I struggled to get loose , and at last broke the Garter that ty 'd up my Leg . I am positive the Prisoner is the Man that bound me , and left me in a large deep Ditch all done over ( overgrown ) with Bushes . 'T was a Star-light Night , and but a little Duskish : I took what Remark I could of the Prisoner all the Way he carry 'd me . He has a very remarkable Voice , speaks very hoarse , and Stammers . Prisoner . I was at another Place from Four 'till Nine , that Evening . Short . When I got loose , I was afraid to go the Way I was brought , so I made over a Field or two , and came to an Alehouse , the Sign of the Queen 's Head and Artichoak : My Hands were still ty 'd , so I shov 'd the Door with my Foot , 't is a Sash Door - half Glass , and thro ' the Glass I saw a Neighbour ; but a little Boy coming to the Door , and seeing me in this frightful Condition , instead of opening the Door , he ran away surpriz 'd at the Sight of me ; but the Neighbour coming to the Door , he let me in ; 't was Mr. Girdler , the Farrier , he came to the Door and let me in ; then the first thing he did , was to untie my Mouth and my Hands , then he got me some Relief , warm 'd me some Beer , and sent three or four Men home with me , with Candles and Lanthorns . The next Morning I was at St. Giles 's Pound , and Mr. Goddard at the Crown , call 'd to me , - Ben , says he , you had a bad Time o n't ; how did you come off ? I told him , I was in a miserable Condition last Night , and let him know what I had lost ; he took it down in Writing , and I described the Prisoner to him , - a tall Man , with a thick hoarse Voice , and he found him out and took him : He got a Constable , and went out upon the Search after him ; I was out with them my self one Night , but he was taken by them without me . John Girdler . I was standing by the Fire-side , at the Queen's-Head and Artichoak , Nov. 23 , and I heard something knock at the Door ; a little Boy went to the Door , but coming back frighted , I stepp 'd to see what was the Matter ; and the Man said ( as plain as he could speak ) Mr Girdler , I am glad to see you ; I have been robb 'd . I let him come in and unty 'd his Mouth . He look 'd very strange and frightful , lying so long in the Cold , and he had only a thin Coat on , no Shirt , no Breeches , nor Shoes ; his Hands were ty 'd very hard behind him , and when I had loosen 'd them , they were so benumm 'd , that he could scarce bring them forward . He told me he had been robb 'd in Mr. Lewis 's Field by two Men . I asked him if he should know either of them again . He said he should know one of them , - the tall Man , he should know by his Voice . Some of my Servants would have gone out directly , in search of the Men ; but I said , they wo n't stay to be sure in the Place where they committed the Fact ; and we had no Arms . After I had warm 'd some Drink , and had given it him , I got him a Pair of Shoes , and three of my Men went home with him . Mr. Goddard . I had heard that Mr. Short had been robb 'd , and seeing him the next Morning , I call 'd to him to know how he had far 'd . He told me ; and I took down an Account of what he had lost , and a Description of the Person . He said he had been robb 'd by two Men , one a middle-siz 'd Man , the other a tall Man , with such a very hoarse Voice , that he was sure he could remember him again particularly . I advis 'd him to come again to me in the Evening , and I sent for Griffiths , and some more Friends , and we went out into the Fields : We divided our selves , but kept within Call . That Night we did nothing ; and the next Morning Mr. Lewis , the Cow-keeper , call 'd upon me , to know if we had not been in the Fields last Night : I told him Yes , we were searching after the Rogues , and we should be glad if we could find them . Says he , if you 'll go up to my Farm at Kentish-Town , there 's a Barn , which two or three Fellows had been observ 'd to frequent , and to go into , and out of , arm 'd , and at Two or Three o'Clock in the Morning . I did not know the Method of these Barns in the Night , so I and my Friends went to take a View of them the Day before , that we might know how to get off if we were over-power 'd . We took a View of several Barns , and as we came home , we call 'd upon a Constable at Kentish-Town , and were informed there was a House in the Town which was frequented by People of ill Fame : We went to this House , ( 't is the Sign of Whittington and his Cat ) about Six o'Clock ; and I saw the Prisoner at the Bar sitting by the Fire , cutting Apples . I took a good View of him , and so did the rest of us ; and imagining he answered the Description which Mr. Short had given me of him , I wanted to hear him speak , so I went up to the Fire-Side , but immediately got up , and without speaking a Word , was going out of the House : I faced him , and told him he must not be gone , I had a Mind to hear him speak : He asked me what Reason I had to prevent his going out ; I told him I was an Officer , and had some Reason to detain him : I am informed , says I , that you have Run-Goods in your Custody , and I must seize them . He spoke pretty largely , and was provoked ; but under this Pretence we searched the House . After we had talked to him some time , we all concluded he was the Man ; so we brought him to my House , and sent for Mr Short , and before I let him see our Man , I told him , we had taken one that answer 'd the Description he had given me ; but for God 's Sake take care what you do ; do n't deceive your self and me too : Take a View of the Man , and you shall hear him speak ; and I will call you out again , and you shall tell me what you think of him . Mr. Short went into the Room to him , and staid some time ; when he came out again , says he , Mr. Goddard , I can swear positively that is the Man that robb 'd me : Justice De Veil hear him say the same . After this , Mr. Short desired to see the Prisoner 's Garters ; he let us see them : I ask 'd him where he bought them ; he said , he could not tell ; but the Prosecutor knew them again , and before Justice De Veil , declared he remembered them again , and that he could swear to his Voice , for ever since he had been robb 'd it had rung in his Ears , and terrify 'd him ; and the more he heard him speak , the more confident he was that the Prisoner was the Man . Prisoner . Was I so hoarse as I am now ? Goddard . I think not . Owen Griffiths . I was sent for by Mr. Goddard , to whom Short had given the Description ; and having heard how barbarously the Man had been used , I went along with them , ( being an Officer ) as Mr. Goddard has related . We searched the Barns that Mr. Lewis directed us to , and then we went to Mr. Wiblin 's , who keeps the White-Horse at Kentish-Town , and we described the Man we were in search of , to him : He could give us no Account of him ; but he and a Neighbour coming a little way over the Fields , they informed us that the Whittington and Cat was a House which was suspected of harbouring such Sort of People , we went there and found this Man , and thinking he answered the Description , we apprehended him . Q . After you brought him to Town , and Short had seen him , what pass 'd then ? Griffiths . Short said he was positive to the Man , and he told the Prisoner , he had not been so good as his Word ; for , says he , you promis 'd the next Man you took , you would come and release me ; but you did not . Q . What Answer did the Prisoner make ? Griffiths . He said we might do as we would ; he had made no Confession . Prisoner 's Defence . I was in Eagle-street , behind the Blue-Boar-Inn in Holbourn , between Three and Four o'Clock in the Afternoon , and from thence I went to Mr. Upton 's in Tower-street , the upper End of Mon-mouth-street , and I went with him to the Three-Tun Alehouse , and was there with six People , and never stirr 'd out of the House 'till Nine . The Prisoner 's Witnesses were examin 'd apart . Richard Upton . I have known the Prisoner , - may be two Years , up and down : He was an Acquaintance of my Journeyman . I am a Peruke-maker , and I live at the Corner of Tower-street , the upper End of Monmouth-street . I have kept a Shop there these seven Years . Q . In November last was the Prisoner in your Company ? Upton . Yes ; he came an Hour before dark , and I shav 'd him . Q . Did he use to be often at your House , or has he been there only once or twice ? Upton I ca n't say I saw him , - but in that Month : It was last Tuesday was a Fortnight , the 23d of November . Q . When he was shav 'd what did you do then ? Upton . After he was shav 'd , he stay 'd some Time , and talk 'd ; and we went to a Publick House , with two more ; he was at the Publick House , and at my House 'till almost Nine . As I am upon Oath , I am safe ; - he came to my Shop a little after Four ; - between Four and Five , and he staid at my Shop the best Part of an Hour , and then we went to the Ale-house , the Corner of Lombard Court in the same Street , - to one Mrs. Palmer 's , in Tower-street , the Corner of Lombard-Court , and he staid at the Ale-house 'till between Eight and Nine . Q . How many were you in Company ? Upton . Three besides my self : Four in all ; - with others coming in and out . Q . Did those Three or Four stay with you all the Time , 'till Eight or Nine ?

I met him going in along with us . Q . And so you Four were in Company together 'till Nine o'Clock ? Upton Yes . Q . And no Body else ? Upton . Not to stay the whole Time : We staid there 'till between Eight and Nine , I believe 'till Nine , - but between Eight and Nine . Q . How come you to remember so particularly the Day of the Month , and the Day of the Week ? You say he had not been there a great while before . Upton . If he had come often , I should not have remember 'd the Day . He was afterwards taken before a Justice , and I was there , knowing him to be wrongfully accused . Q . And did not you hear then , the Day of the Week , or the Month mention 'd , on which this Robbery was committed ? Upton . Yes ; but I did not observe it , nor remember it at all . Q . How came you not to take Notice of that , when you could remember what was said and done at your House ? Upton . I could remember that by my daily Work . Q . Was you at Work your self that Day ? Upton . No , I was not at Work my self : there was weaving and mounting ( I believe ) going forwards . I shav 'd the Prisoner ; and I shav 'd other Customers , and might stand still sometimes . Strock and Dod were weaving at the same Time . Sometimes they sit down for a Day 's Work , or a Week 's , as I have Occasion for them . I employed them both at that Time . Q . What Hour do they usually leave Work ? Upton . They were not regular Journeymen by the Week ; but sometimes they do a Job for me , and I pay them for it , ^ they were not at Work for Wages then , they only sat down to help me , and I gave them Victuals and Drink . ^ See Dod 's Evidence . p. 31 Q . Had they been at Work for you in the beginning of the Day ? Upton . The best Part of the Day they had , and Strock the best Part of the Week . Q . And did they work for nothing ? Upton . I satisfied them one Way or other , at this Time they were to stand to my Generosity ; there 's a Reckoning between Strock and I , and I shall pay him what I agreed for . Q . Do you use to take your Journeymen from your Work and carry them to the Ale-house ? Upton . 'T is not to my Credit to do so , but I often have ; especially when I meet with a Friend . Q . Were you acquainted with the Prisoner at the Bar ? Upton . Yes ; Dod brought him acquainted with me , he call 'd upon him as he was at Work . Q . Is the Prisoner a Peruke-maker . Upton . Yes , by Trade ; as I have been informed by Dod . He has wove at my Shop , but I paid him nothing for it . Q . And did he do it for his Diversion ? Upton . Yes ; as any Body else may do . Q . Did you take any Memorandum of the Day of the Month ? Upton . Yes , I set it down in my Book , that I might be safe . Q . Did you set it down in your Book the Day he was at your Shop ? Upton .

Q . You say you have drank with him several Times ; can you remember any other Time , but this 23d of November ? Upton . No ; I can not say I do . I did not think I should have had any Occasion to have taken Notice of any Thing farther ; as he was call 'd in Question soon after . Q . Who attended you at the Ale-house ? Upton . Mrs. Palmer , she brought some of the Liquor , I ca n't say all . Prisoner . She brought us all the Liquor . Q . What did the Reckoning come to ? Upton . A Shilling . I had no Money , so the Prisoner paid all : when we Brothers of the Trade meet , they that have most Money pay all . - Strock . I am a Peruke Maker ; I was at Work at Mr. Upton 's , - Q . And how are you employ 'd ? By the Day , or by the Piece , or how ? Strock . I am employ 'd by the Week , - at so much a Week . ^ I was employed at this very Time by the Week . ^ See Upton 's Evidence , p. 28 . Q . When was this Time ? Strock . The 2d of November , and all that Week . Q . Did you stay with him no longer ? Strock . I worked Two Days with him last Week . Q . Did you work with him about the middle , or the latter End of November ? Strock . I worked with him that Week , and Two Days after that ; and then I was employ 'd by another Master ; this was the Beginning of November . I worked with him no more than that Week , and Two Days last Week : then I was sent for by a Master in Bond-Street to do other Work . Q . What were the Days last Week , on which you work 'd ? Strock . Monday and Tuesday . Q . What Days of the Month were they ? Strock . I can not tell ; but 't was Monday and Tuesday last Week . Q . So when you was at work with Upton you saw the Prisoner ? Strock . Yes . Q . What , one of these Two last Days you worked with Upton ? Strock . No , 't was on the 3d of November that the Prisoner came to our Shop , and my Master shav 'd him : 't was on a Tuesday , and he complain 'd his Face was sore , and desired a good Razor ; after he was shav 'd he staid half an Hour . Then he desired my Master to go and drink a Mug of Beer with him at the Three-Tuns , the Corner of Lombard-Court ; so my Master and another young Man who was in the Shop went with him , and he desired me to go too . Q . Is not this above a Month ago ? Strock . No ; 't is but a Fortnight ago . Q . Do you think it might be Monday or Tuesday last was a Month ? Strock . No ; it was a Fortnight ago , it was the 23d of November , - I believe it was the 24th of November when I came to him . Q. Recollect your self ; can not you be certain ? Strock .

Strock . He was my Master 's Acquaintance , and none of mine ; I did not go with them . Q . What , did not you go with them last Tuesday was Fortnight ? Strock . - Yes , - the 23d . Q. Aye , - the 23d , you can remember pretty well ; but who went with the Prisoner and your Master ? Strock . Tom . Davis ; and we staid 'till past Eight . I do n't know what the Reckoning came to , - we had but Four full Pots , and ( I believe ) the Prisoner treated . Q . You say , you had but four Pots of Beer ; do you go so often to the Ale-house , and yet not know what four Pots of Beer come to ? Strock . I do n't know . I believe a Shilling . I never saw him but once before . Q . How come you to remember the Day so particularly ? Strock . Because I was before the Justice with him , when he was taken up . Q . Did you hear the Day of the Month mentioned there ? Strock . No ; but he sent for my Master , and because I work 'd there , therefore I remember 'd it . Q . You said you were employ 'd by the Week ; has your Master paid you for the Work you did then ? Strock . No ; he said he would pay me when he got Money . - I got a Crown from him . Q .

After he was shav 'd , he said he would give Upton a Pot of Beer ; he was a slender Acquaintance of my Master Upton 's , - I had not seen him there before for a great while . I was there , helping him to make a Peruke . Q . Was you to be paid for your Work ? Davis . No . Q . Did Upton go with the Prisoner to the Ale-house ? Davis . No , I went with him , and Upton followed by himself , and Strock came in afterwards ; we left him at work in the Shop . Q . Who else came into your Company ? Davis . George Dod came to us , but he came from another Place where he had been at work , - from one Mr. Green 's . Q . How came Dod into your Company ? Davis . While we were drinking I went out for Oysters for the Prisoners , and I met Dod , and told him that Gill was at an Ale-house ; so he went in with me , and we all staid together till almost Nine o'Clock ; we had four Pots ; I had no Money , so the Prisoner paid I believe - , no , - I wo n't say who paid . Q . What did the Reckoning come to ? Davis . I ca n't tell , but the Landlady , and her Daughter , and another Woman , waited on us . When we parted I went to my Lodging in Earl's-Court The Prisoner was none of my Acquaintance but my Master 's . The Prisoner and I went first , my Master followed us in five Minutes , and Strock came in afterwards . I had been for Oysters and was putting them in the Fire to roast , when my Master came in . Q . How many had you in Company ? Davis . Four ; Strock , Upton , myself , and Dod , that 's four , and the Prisoner , that makes five .

The Prisoner talked about sending Tom Davis to Hounslow for a Horse . When we parted we all came out of the House together , and we left the Prisoner in Holbourn ; the rest of us parted in Long-Acre . I remember the 23d of November , because I had been sent of an Errand , and staid so long , that when I came Home my Master gave me a good Box o'th ' Ear , and said he 'd make me remember the 23d of November . Mrs Palmer . ( the Landlady . ) I live in Lombard Court at the Three-Tuns . On the 23d of November there came a Man to my House to ask for a Man who was drinking with the Prisoner ; I says , he 's gone out with another Gentleman .

After this , I saw the Captain much in Liquor , - he seem 'd to stagger , and those two Fellows kept with him : I did not like them , and had a Curiosity to see what they would do to him . I observed the least of them on one Side of his Pocket ; but they taking Notice of me , one of them was a coming up to me , but I was afraid of them , and went away . I took Notice of the Man that was coming up to me , he had a sort of a whitish Face , and a brown Coat : I pick 'd the Man afterwards out of a Room full of People . I wo n't swear positively that is the Man , but I think in my Heart he is the same . Q . Where is the Man with a white Face ? Walker . I do n't know where he is now ; but I pick 'd him out of a Room full of People . Q . Look about you , do you see the Man ? Walker . That 's the Man . [ The Witnesses went directly to the Bar and took Anthill by the Hand ] This is the Man . - That Man stood by the Captain , and that was the Man that came over the Kennel to me . Q . Was not the Link put out ? Walker . Yes ; but I saw the Man 's Face that came over to me , while the Linkman was with them : He was one that bid the Linkman take his Cane ; - I ca n't swear positively that he is the Man . When that Man came up to me , I was afraid , and so I went directly home : This was about Ten o'Clock . Jane Tyrrel . I know the three Prisoners , Anthill , Waters and Brown : I know nothing of the old Man . I remember the Night that Capt . Innys was found murdered , by their own Words ; it was the 19th of Dec . I was a hired Servant to Anthill , at 6 l. a Year . That Sunday we had baked Pork for Dinner , and it was not done enough . Q . What Business does he follow ? Tyrrel . He keeps a House in Black and White-Court in the Old Bailey ; - about Six or Seven o'Clock that Sunday Night , Tom Waters came in to Anthill 's House , and this Phil Brown came in ; they drank two half Quarters of Gin together , and Tom Waters paid Anthill 2 d. for the Geneva When they had drank the Gin , they Three went out together , between Six and Seven o'Clock . Between Nine and Ten Anthill came in again by himself , and flung his Hat down upon the Table , and said , G - d D - n it , what have we done ! - we have taken his Hat and left his Money ! I had a Stake of Pork broiling on the Fire , and while I was turning it , in came Tom Waters , and he cry 'd G - d D - n my Eyes , we have taken his Sword , and left the Scabbard and Money behind . I did not see Brown 'till the Wednesday following . Then says Anthill to Waters , G - d D - n it , what have you done with the Blade ? Q . What had Anthill in his Hand when he went out ? Tyrrel . He took out a Stick with him . Q . Had Waters any Thing in his Hand ? Tyrrel . God forbid I should say any Thing but of a Stick . Neither of them had any Sword . Waters had a Stick when he went out , and a Stick when he came in again . Then a n't please you , Anthill said , what have you done with the Blade of the Sword ? Waters said , he had broke it into four Pieces ; then G - d D - n it says Anthill , it will serve for nothing but Files : what they meant I could not tell , I was not a Judge of their material Way of thinking . After this had pass 'd , they both went out of Doors , and came in again ; then Anthill went out and call 'd Tom . Waters out to him , and in about two Minutes I heard Tom bid Anthill Good Night , telling him , he was going Home . When Anthill came in again , he said , - G - d D - n it ! I gave him but one Blow ! Have you been Fighting says I ; can one Blow kill a Man ? ( not knowing any Thing of the Matter then ) Yes , says he , - just here ; putting his Hand under his Wig , this was about Ten o'Clock . Then he sat down by the Fire , and trembled , and could not eat a Bit . About Eleven o'Clock , when the Watchman came about , I took the Candle off the Table and hid it in the Closet , that he might not see the Light . I could not imagine what made him tremble so , I thought he might be in Liquor ; for I did not know any Thing of the Murder 'till Monday Morning Seven o'Clock , and then at a Chandler 's Shop , I heard one say of me , that Woman lives in Black and White-Court where the Man was kill 'd : this made me have a Thought ; so I stept Home , and went to Anthill 's Bedside , and said , Joe , what do you think ! I do n't know what to think said he , and cry 'd - I gave him but one Blow ; what need you to be frighted , my Dear , says he to me ! I gave him but one Blow . Q . When did you first discover these Expressions and this Behaviour ? Tyrrel . About Five Weeks and odd Days ago ; to one Mr. Gordon at his House ; and when Anthill was taken up , he could not disown one Word . Q . How come you to conceal a Thing of this Importance so long ? Tyrrel . If I must expose my self , I must , - I was under Confinement Nine Days or a Fortnight , - and when People have seen me crying , and ask 'd me the Reason , I have said , I am sorry that I should keep Company with such People , for because I am a Woman of the Town , the People would say , I did it out of Spite , if I should reveal it . Anthill . Did you never call me bloody-minded Thief ? Tyrrel . Yes , because you said you gave him but one Blow , and that was his Death . Anthill . We had a great Quarrel because I would not live no longer with her as my Wife . Ask her , if I did not come Home and tell her there was a Gentleman drunk in the Old-Baily , and if I did not say , we staid with him 'till Mr. Atkins and his Son came to him . Tyrrel . No , nothing like it ; but when he came in he slung down his Hat and trembled . Waters . Ask her , why she did not remember me when Anthill was committed to the Counter ? Tyrrel . I mentioned Waters when I made the Discovery to Gordon , but when I was carried before my Lord Mayor , I was so surpriz 'd that I forgot the rest of them . - Gordon . I live in Hanging-Sword Alley in Fleet-street ; I am a Joiner . I ca n't remember the Day of the Month , but 't was one Friday Night Tyrrel was at my House , and seem 'd very uneasy . I ask 'd her what was the Matter ; she was ready to cry , and made no Answer . My Wife told me , that she ( Tyrrel ) knew something of the Murder of Capt . Innys . I told her , if she did , it was but Justice to bring it out ; but I did not ask her much about it that Night , because I wanted to go to Bed ; however , next Day she went before the Lord-Mayor and made the Discovery . As to the Men , I know nothing of them ; only I know she told the same Story before him , ( with Regard to Anthill ) that she has told now . I heard her mention Tom Waters , and that he came into Anthill 's House that Evening , but I ca n't be sure whether she spoke of him at my Lord Mayor 's or not , for I was not near enough to hear all that she said . Peter Ellames . On the 19th of September , about 10 o'Clock at Night , I saw the Deceased lying on his Back in the Old Baily I thought he was dying , and said , it was pity nobody would lend their Assistance to get him to the Watch-House ; so I got him thither and sent for a Surgeon to bleed him , and after that he was carried to the Bell-Inn . Prisoner Brown . Ask him whether he took Notice of his Buckles ? Mr. Ellames . When he was taken off the Ground he had both Buckles in his Shoes , but when he was brought into the Watch-House he had but one . Samuel Hinson . After Anthill was committed , I went to see Waters in the Compter , his Mother and several others were with him , and after some Talk he started up , and said , d - n his Soul , Anthill was as guilty of the Murder , as he was innocent . William Murrey . I bought the Cane of the Prisoner , the Linkman , one Sunday Night ; he asked a Shilling for it , I said I had but Six-pence ; he said I might lend him that upon the Cane 'till the next Day , and I agreed with him , that if he fetch 'd it not the next Day , it was to be my own . Mr. Oakley . This Cane is mine ; I was visiting at a Friend 's House in July last , and left this Cane behind me when I came away . How it came to Mr. Innys , I ca n't tell . Capt . Carr . I know that Mr. Innys had that very Cane , that 's all I know . Mr. Murray . I can not swear that Brown brought me the Buckle to sell it , he might or might not ; I will not swear what I do n't know . Elizabeth Cockran . On Sunday September 19 , the Prisoner Brown , came to my Room with a carv 'd Buckle , about Half an Hour after Ten at Night , he said he had taken it out of the Gentleman 's Shoe in the Old-Baily , and if the People had not come up , he should have got something else . There was some Blood upon his Coat , I asked him how it came , and he told me his Nose had been bleeding . My Husband had given him Leave to lodge with me in my Room . Anthill . Nathan Cockran is now in Newgate , and Brown is an Evidence against him on that Account . Maccartey . I was a Hackney-Coachman , but being reduc 'd to Poverty , I carried a Link . Towards Charing-Cross the Gentleman ply 'd me , and I was to light him to Fleet-Ditch ; when we came there he said he had no man Money , and bid me go about my Business . I said it was very hard ; and told him , I had never seen him before ; upon that he struck at me with his Cane , and dropped it ; I took it up , and every Body said , keep the Cane , poor Man , keep it , and the Gentleman cry 'd , d - n the Cane , 't is not worth Three-pence Anthill . I happened to come by and saw the Gentleman lying in the Street , there was Atkins the Constable 's Son with me , but I have no Money to Subpoena him . I own I was by at the same Time ; all the Woman has said is Spight , because I would not live with her . I have no Friends here at present . Q . What Business do you follow ? Anthill . I am a Baker 's Servant in Rose-Street . Waters . I shall prove I was at Home all that Night . Thomas Bailey . I was at Waters 's Mother 's House that Night with the Prisoner , and his Brother Jack , and Mr. Target , from Six , till Half an Hour after Ten ; I did not see him go out of the House all that Time . He came down Stairs to us between Seven and Eight in a Dishabille and undrest . Daniel Lee . I was at Mr. Moss 's that Night the Gentleman was found in the Old Baily , from four or five , till ten o'Clock ; I left the Prisoner Waters at Home ; I was going into Black-and-White Court to one Mr. Crane , a Cabinet-Maker , and passing up the Old Baily , I saw the Gentleman lie , I thought he was fuddled ; I did not stay by him above two or three Minutes , nor did I take Notice of any of the People that were about him . Target . I was at Mrs. Moss 's House , the Prisoner 's Mother , the Sign of the Hospital-Gate in Smithfield , from eight till eleven that Night , and he was not absent at all from eight till eleven , except when he went down to draw Beer . Phoebe Hinson . Last Night one Dickey Sawyer and Margaret Franklyn , were charged with this Murder . All acquitted . 97 , 98 , 99.

Isaac Burges was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on Thomas Howson feloniously did make an Assault , and with his Right Hand , on the Left Side of the Head , the said Howson did beat and strike , by Means of which Beating , & c. the said Howson received a mortal Wound on the Right Side of his Head , of which he instantly died , in the Parish of St. Vedast alias Foster , Nov. 20 . Nathaniel Smith . I ca n't say any Thing about the Murder , I did not see it done : The Deceased was my Apprentice , and the Prisoner my Journeyman ; November 20 we had been setting a Batch of Bread in the Cellar , and the Deceased was eating his Breakfast there ; I called him to carry out his Bread , he came up , and took a Basket , and set it down by the Side of the Counter ; I saw the Water in his Eyes , and asked him what was the Matter ; he said , Isaac had struck him ; then he went behind the Door and set down upon a Sack of Bran ; I called him two or three Times , he made no Answer ; but the Prisoner coming up , I ask 'd him what was the Matter ; he said the Boy had struck him , and he would not be struck by an Apprentice ; then he went down again . My Wife and I fancy 'd the Boy was in a Fit , we got Water and put into his Mouth ; as he was a sulky Boy , we still imagin 'd he sham 'd it . I bid Isaac carry out the Bread , and then we threw Water in the Boy 's Face ; he seem 'd to blow a little , so my Wife sent for some Hartshorn , and clapp 'd it to his Nose , but it had no Effect . Then I sent for a Surgeon , and he open 'd a Vein , but he did not bleed at all . Elizabeth Smith gave much the same Account . Sarah Sands gave an Account of the good Agreement there had been between the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd . Richard Kemm , ( Apothecary ) About Twelve or One o'Clock , my Master was sent for to Mr. Smith 's : He not being at home , I went , and found the Body dead , and without Pulse . The Surgeon came and open 'd a Vein , but he did not bleed . We search 'd him , and upon his Body , we found only a small Wound just above his Ear , about the Bigness of an Orifice made when a Person is blooded . Mr. Barugh enquired of the Prisoner what he had struck the Deceas 'd with ; he said he could not tell how it was , - it was some how with his Fist . Thomas Barugh , Nov. 20 . About Noon I was sent for to bleed Mr. Smith 's Apprentice ; I found him dead , and that he could not bleed ; I open 'd a Vein , but 't was to no Purpose . After he was carry 'd up Stairs , and the Body was stripp 'd , we found a small Wound a little above the Ear : I put my Probe into it , but it would pass no farther than thro ' the Skin . While he was laid upon the Bed , there was a great Quantity of Blood came out of his Nose . The Prisoner told me , he only struck him with his Fist . On the Monday following my Master open 'd the Head , and we found a Perforation thro ' the Skull , triangular , and about the Bigness of the End of this Probe , and a great Quantity of coagulated Blood between the two Membranes of the Brain . The Perforation thro ' the Skull , answered directly to the Wound in the Flesh , above the Ear . I take the Perforation to have been made by a Nail , for it answered exactly to the exterior Wound in the Flesh , only it was ragged about the Edges . Mr. Frewen . The Monday after this Accident happen 'd , I open 'd the Head of the Deceas 'd . I saw a small Wound , about the Size of an Orifice made by a Lancet , in bleeding : It was transverse , and rather cross the Temple , than from the upper Part of the Head to the lower . It appear 'd to me ( at first ) only a slight Scratch in the Skin . I laid the Scalp bare , with intent to take off the Cranium as low as I could ; and I was obliged ( from the bearing of the Cranium , to raise the temporal Muscles on each Side , to make way for my Saw . Then I rais 'd the Cranium and found between the Dura Mater and the Pia Mater , a considerable Quantity of congeal 'd Blood . Then I examin 'd the Perforation thro ' the Cranium : It appear 'd on the temporal Bone , just above the Ear , and it exactly answer 'd the Wound in the Skin , but I could not , with any Instrument I had , find any Passage thro ' the Temporal Muscle , for this Muscle lay immediately under the Skin , between the Wound and the Perforation in the Cranium : But I believe the Situation of this Muscle was somewhat alter 'd upon the Death of the Person : The flabby Parts may close up , or contract , so as to conceal and cover the Perforation in the Skull . I apprehend , that from the Blow given on the opposite Side of the Head , he might fall upon something Sharp , which gave him that Wound ; and there was a Blackness on the opposite side of the Head . Defence . The Deceas 'd was a strong young Fellow , about 17 or 18 ; he struck me , and I gave him a Blow , but not with an Intent to kill or murder him . Guilty , Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 106. Mary Sommers , was indicted , for that she , on the 14th of February , in the Second Year of his Majesty 's Reign , at the Parish of St . Brides , took to Husband John Sommers ; and that afterwards , viz . on the 27th of April , in the Second Year of his Majesty 's Reign , in the Parish of St. Bennet , Paul's-Wharf , she took to Husband , her former Husband being then living . The Council for the Prosecution open 'd the Charge , and the Nature of the Evidence . And , The Council for the Defendant observed , that tho ' in the Preamble to the Statute , it is said to be an equal Offence , whether a Man marry two Wives , or a Woman two Husbands , yet the enacting Part makes it only an Offence to marry , having a Wife still living . And whenever a new Felony is made by Act of Parliament , the Act is never construed to extend farther than the Letter . The Council for the Prosecution reply 'd , that the Intention of the Statute was to punish Women , as well as Men ; that this was evident from the Title of the Statute , and even from the Enacting Part itself , which says , If any Person or Persons , being marry 'd , or which hereafter shall marry , do , at any Time ( after the End of this Sessions of Parliament ) marry any other Person or Persons , the former Wife being alive , & c. That no one with Reason could say , that because former Husband , is not express 'd in this Part of the Statute , 't is no Crime for a Woman to marry a second , her former Husband being alive . That the same Construction has always been put upon the Statute , which they now contended for ; Women as well as Men having been indicted upon it . That in the Recital of the Act , the Intention was plain ; the Words being , - if any Person or Persons , within his Majesty 's Dominions of England and Wales , being marry 'd , do at any Time or Times marry another , the former Husband or Wife being alive , it shall be Felony . The Court deffer 'd giving their Opinion on the Objection made to the Statute by the Prisoner 's Council , and order 'd the Evidence to be call 'd . Dr Gainham . I am a Minister of the Church of England ; I was a School-master and Curate at Bow by Stratford , about 20 Years ago . I was in the Fleet when I marry 'd them ; 't was on the 14th of Feb on the turn of the Year . This is the Book I take the Names of the People I marry in . I marry 'd John Sommers of Hannam , Gloucestershire , Gent . and Mary Wallen Spinster , at the Kings Arms Tavern ; I have some Idea of her , but can not swear positively to her . I think she is the same Person . The Wedding was kept at Mr. White 's at the Kings Arms Tavern , and I drank Tea with them the next Morning , They Lay there that Night . Mrs. White and the Gentlewoman that was marry 'd sung ; they said it was Polly Peachum . I remember a great Dispute arose between her and me at it , for she was printed in the Bills Miss Warren , and when I came to put down her Name in my Book , says I , pray tell me your right Name , and she told me it was Wallen , and not Warren . This is a Pocket Book , in which I put Names down , and then I enter them into this Book Councel . Was this Entry made at the Time of their Marriage : Gainham . Yes ; and no Alteration has been made in it since . Q . Who was present , beside your self ? Gainham . Mr. Thomas Woodyere , and an elderly Woman , who call 'd her self King Q . Did Mr. White , the Master of the House sup with you ? Gainham . He came up ; but did not stay to sup . Q . Have you any Reason to say you marry 'd these People , but by the Entry in this Book ? Gainham . No . Q . Will you tell me whether all this is right ? John Sommers of Hannam , Gloucestershire , Gent . To Mary Wallen , Spinster , Kings-Arms , Private : Pray what 's the Meaning of Private ? Gainham . The Gentleman desired it might not be known . Q. Pray was it all wrote at the same Time ? Gainham . Yes . Q . Will you put on your best Spectacles ? Was it wrote all at one House ? Gainham . Yes . Q . And with the same Ink ? Gainham . Yes , upon my Word it was : and I never alter 'd it . Q . Will you look upon it again ? Gainham . May be I might call for a better Pen . Q . But if you call 'd for a better Pen , you wrote with the same Ink : here 's a Word blotted out King's-Head , and the Words under are King's-Arms . You have struck out King's-Head , and with blacker Ink , and a different Pen , you have wrote King's-Arms . Gainham . My Lord ; - 't is Eight Years ago . Councel Well , Doctor , when was this Entry made ? Gainham . On the Day of Marriage , and here I enter all my Marriages ; this Entry was made on the Day of Marriage . Counc Def . You can not read this in Evidence . Counc . Pros . I have know them read at a Trial at Bar . Q . What is this 14 for ? Gainham . That 's the Day of the Month . Q . Why here are a great many People ruin 'd in a Month . - Pray are there any Entries made here of People marry 'd by any other beside yourself ? Gainham . No . Councel . Look to the first Day of the Month . C. I am going to it ; but I must turn over a great many Leaves before I come to it . Q . You do n't make these Alterations , but when you have Occasion for them . Councel . What Money , Doctor , had you for this Alteration ? Gainham Not a Farthing , as I hope to be sav 'd : Q . Do you keep any other Book ? for I have seen some of your People who have kept two , one with close Lines , and the other with open Lines . Gainham . I have Three Register Books , and I have a Ledger , in which I enter them ; and I can easily find out any . My Books are paged and number 'd . I never made a false Entry in my Life . Q . Do you enter into these Books from the little Book ? Gainham . Yes , and the Entries into these Books are always according to the Entries in the little Book . Q . Read the Entry of this Marriage in the little Book , and compare it with the great Book . Councel . 14 . Feb. John Sommers , of Hannam , Gloucestershire , Gent . To Mary Wallen of Clements Dane , Spinster , King's-Arms , Private . Compare them , and see if they are not both the same Ink , as to all but the King's-Arms . The Alteration seems to be made long since the Entry . The King 's Head it was first . Gainham . That was a Mistake . Councel . Was there any such Tavern as the King 's Head in 1728 . Gainham . No ; none but the King's-Arms . Councel The Ledger goes according to the amended Entry , and wrote with the same Ink . Councel . The Entries here , are very regular . C. The Entry in the Ledger is the same Ink as that in the Day Book , the Alteration in the little Book seems to be done with a different Ink . C. K .. 'T is a Misfortune that Marriages of this kind are so frequent ; but the Ledger is fair , and the Entry is fair . You said something just now of some Songs , which were sung by her . Gainham . There were some Songs sung by Mrs. White and she . C. K. Do you remember what she was call 'd ? Gainham . Some body told me , she was Polly Peachum . C. K. When was this ? Gainham . In the Year 28 , or 29 . Q . Was not the second Polly Peachum since that Time ? Mr. White In the Year 1728 , I kept the King's-Arms Tavern on Ludgate-Hill . Q . Was any such Tavern as the King 's Head there ? White . No , there was but two , the King's-Arms and the Crown . Councel . Do you remember John Sommers and the Prisoner being at your House ? White . I ca n't say I know Sommers , but I remember something of the Prisoner 's Face , though I ca n't say positively that is she ; I remember I ask 'd who was above Stairs , and my People said , one who went by the Name of Wallen or Polly Peachum , and that Mr. Gainham was above with them , and had married them ; he was with them all Day , and I believe they dined at my House , and they asked me to dine , but I do n't know whether I did or not ; I drank a Glass of Wine with them . I can not swear to the Woman . Councel . Did they sup at your House ? White . I can not be positive ; there was some Company there singing , and I believe my Wife went up and sung too : I heard several Songs , and I think she is the Person , but I ca n't swear it . Mrs Coker . I know Mrs. Wallen : In February 1728 she lived at my Brother 's House , I lived there too at that Time , 't was in Cary-Street ; she lodged there Part of the Year 1728 , but I wo n't be positive that she lived to the End of that Year there ; I believe she was there in March . I remember Mr. Sommers , one who went by that Name , but I did not hear when they were going to be married . Q . Do you remember Mr. Wallen 's going away in February ? Mrs. Coker . Yes , she went away with the Gentleman who said his Name was John Sommers ; I remember my Sister lay-in , and he stood Godfather to the Child . They went away the 14th of Feb. in a Coach from our House , with an old Gentlewoman , one Mrs. King . Q . Did they return to your House that Night ? Mrs. Coker . No , Mrs. King did . Neither Mr. Sommers nor Mrs. Wallen returned 'till next Day . Q . When they returned the next Day , did they live at your House any Time afterwards ? Mrs. Coker . Yes , about a Fortnight , and in that Time both Sommers and she owned they were married , but I do n't remember whether they mentioned the Place where they were marry 'd or not . I heard them say they were marry 'd , the next Day ; they liv 'd and lay together as Man and Wife . Coun . There is a remarkable Day in February , Madam , a coupling Day ; all the young Women remember Valentine 's Day . Mrs. Coker . Yes ; 't was Valentine 's Day . Q . After Mr. Sommers went away , when did you see him again ? Mrs. Coker . About a Year afterwards he came into the House where I liv 'd to ask for her , I do n't know whether he asked for her by the Name of Sommers , but he asked me where she liv 'd , for she did not lodge there a great while after she was married , but I saw him about a Twelvemonth afterwards - the Beginning of the next March was Twelvemonths , but I am not positively sure . Coun . Can you be sure it was 10 Months ? Can you be sure it was eight Months ? Mrs. Coker . Yes ; tho ' I do n't remember the particular Time , yet I can take upon me to swear that I saw him alive eight Months after . Coun . Def . I take an Exception to the Establishment of the Marriage : 'T is not sufficient , in Cases of this Nature , to prove a Cohabitation : They must give Evidence of an actual Marriage ; all the Proof they can give , is this Fleet-Register , which ought to have no Weight at all . I submit it , whether they have established the first Marriage . C. Criminal Marriages must be positively proved for Men and Women in this wicked Town , who live together , to say they are marry 'd , is not sufficient Evidence . Councel . Here is the Man of the House remembers something of the Woman , and remembers likewise the Doctor present , at the same Time . C. This is Evidence to create a Suspicion ; if a Person is accused of a Crime , it must not be Suspicion , but positive Evidence that must be brought against him . Councel . The Evidence of Gainham , perhaps may be thought not sufficient , but the Parties themselves have acknowledged it . Pray how long did they live together as Man and Wife ? ( To Mrs . Coker . ) Mrs. Coker . About a Fortnight , and then he went away ; after he had been gone two or three Days , she told me he was gone into the Country . A Juryman . I desire to know whether she went by the Name of Polly Peachum , when she was marry 'd ? Mrs. Coker . She acted the Part ; and there was no other at that Time , and she then belonged to the Play-house . I have heard her sing my self . Acquitted .
