John Chamberlain . I live in Cock-Lane , West-Smithfield . On the seventh of November , between eight and nine at Night , the Street Door of my House was broke open first , and then the Door of my Closet , from whence my Plate and other Goods were taken . Then the Prisoner 's Confession made November the tenth before Sir Richard Brocas , was proved and read in Court . He confest that on the seventh of November about eight at Night , he and Alex Rathe broke open a House in Cock-Lane , and took the Plate and other Goods ( mentioned in the Indictment ) and sold the Plate to Thomas Whitehead , a Watchmaker in George-Alley by the Ditch-side for four Guineas , and that Whitehead melted all the Plate down . Edward Lawrence . Here is a Copper Tea Kettle , a Shirt , and a pair of Brass Tea Tongs , which I found in the Prisoner 's Room . Prosecutor . These are my Goods . Lawrence . I have been Constable two or three Years on the other side of the Water - A Neighbour of mine having had his House broke open , I suspected the Prisoner , because he had been an Evidence against Williams , Isaacson , and Gulliford ( in February last . ) I and G. Holderness went to look for him , and making Enquiy , we heard that the Prosecutor 's House had been broke open too . We found the Prisoner abed in his Room in Black-boy Alley in Chick-Lane . We secured him and four or five Women who were in the same Room . Perceiving a loose Board in the Floor we took it up , and found a Dark Lanthorn , a piece of Wax Candle , a Tinder Box , and these two Iron Instruments . I asked him what he did with them . He told me they were his Mills , with which he could open any Door in England - This with the Claw at the End of it is to wrench with , and this with the Round Hole is to put over the Head of a Bolt to force it out . Next Morning he desired to be made an Evidence . I asked him how many Accomplices he had . Why , says he . If you had let me alone but one Night longer , I and three more were to have milled a Silversmith and then I could have jamm 'd three or four , but now I can do but one , and that 's Alexander Rathe . Indeed I had another Friend , but he was buried last Night , or else I could have done for two . Prisoner . This Lawrence broke open my Room and took me and my Wife and three more Women , and carried us to the Compter ; but he not being a Constable on this side the Water , the Keeper would not take us in , tho ' I desired him to do it ; and so Lawrence carried us over the Water ; and G - D - your Blood , says he , If you do n't turn Evidence , I shall find some that will swear against you . As for the Mills , they were left at my Room by John Stanley , on whose Evidence John Chickley was apprehended . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 10. Ann Drury alias Walker , was indicted for privately stealing twenty two Guineas , from the Person of John Baccett , October 28 . John Baccett . On the ninth of June about Ten at Night I met two Women in Fleet-street , who asked me to give 'em a glass of Wine , I thought one of them was like a Maid who had been my Servant , but had rob 'd me of a pair of Silver Spurs , for which I dismist her , and so to be satisfied I went with them to the Prisoner 's House in Hind-Court in Fleet-street , where I soon found my Mistake . However , I trea ed them with a Tiff of Punch , and after that , with another , and then they went away , and then I and my Landlady ( the Prisoner ) had another Tiff . I had been drinking before with a Captain on board a Ship , of which I was part Owner . - And so I fell a Sleep - When I waked I asked what was to Pay . The Prisoner said I had nothing to Pay , and that was true enough - for she had left me nothing in my Pocket ( except three Pence ) as I found when I came home . So I went to her next Day , and asked her if she knew the two Women that were in my Company over Night . No , says She , but they were merry free Girls , and you gave them a Shilling a Piece , and went out with them . I told her , I mist some Gold and a Gilt Metal Watch , and an old fashion 'd Tweezer Case . She said she would endeavour to help me to 'em again So we had a Tiff of Punch , and we agreed to Advertise the Watch and Tweezer-Case , to be left at her House , with a Reward of a Guinea for the Watch , and a Crown for the Tweezer-Case . I Advertis 'd accordingly , and in two or three Days went to the Prisoner 's House again . And she told me a Woman had been there with the Watch , but would not leave it because I had not left the Money . Why Madam , Says I you might have laid the Money down for me , when you would have had the Goods for your Security . But however , there 's a Guinea for the Watch , and a Crown for the Tweezer Case . So I left the Money and came again next Day , and had another Tiff of Punch , and then she produced the Watch . But where 's the Case Madam ? - What Case ! is not the Watch in the Case ? - Aye but the Tweezer-Case , Madam - Lord Sir , I know nothing of the Tweezer-Case - Why Madam did not I leave a Guinea for the Watch and a Crown for the Tweezer-Case ? I swear Sir I thought you had meant the Watch Case , for I never read the Advertisement ; but D - the Bitch , I know where she lives , and she shall never sting me so , for I 'll make her bring the Case . So we parted , and when I came the next time , she told me , truly the Case was Pawn 'd for a Crown , and she must have a Crown to redeem it . Why Madam this is a sort of a Bite upon me , did not I give ye a Crown for the Case ! - Aye , but Sir I paid that for the Watch-Case . Nay Madam if that 's the Case I am as far off as ever , tho ' it has cost me three times more to get this Case than ever the Case was Worth . And with that I went away and resolv 'd to go no more after it , for I thought with myself I might chance this Woman to Eternity , about my Case , and all to no purpose . However , about two Months afterwards I received 100 l. at the Bank , and paid away 75 l. of it . And going home about twelve at Night with the rest of my Money in my Pocket , and seeing the Prisoner 's door open and a Woman in the Window , a Whim came into my Head to call once more for this Case , And so I goes in , and there was Madam mighty glad to see me , and wondring what was become of me , and why I did not call for my Case , Well , have ye got it now ? - Aye , Sir , but shall we not drink first - With all my Heart , let 's have a Tiff of punch . So the Punch was brought , and then she bid her Maid fetch the Case , but the Maid told her it was too late . Upon this I gave Madam half a Guinea to Change . I ca n't change it says she , but sha n't we have t'other Tiff . I answer 'd No she replied , yes but we will , and I 'll join with ye . I was not forward to join with her , but , she brought in another Tiff . I tasted it and told her it was to strong , for it was almost all Brandy . She said she loved it so , for if it was not Stiff it would give her the Cholic . Then I ask 'd her for my Change , and she said she 'd fetch it ; but she stay 'd so long that I fell asleep , and when I waked I found her leaning over my Chair with her Hand in my Pocket I ask 'd her what she meant by that ? She pulled her hand away with my Gold in it and said , Here is a fine parcel of Money to carry along the streets at this time of Night . Do ye think I 'll let you go out of my House with so much Gold about ye ? - No - if you should fall into ill Company and lose it , you 'll think you have lost it here , and then I must bear the blame , and therefore I 'll take Care of it till you come again . But Madam , says I , is that a Reason for Picking my Pocket ? Why Dovee , says she , do you think now that I would rob you of this Money ? No , it shall be as safe as if you had it at home . I 'll assure you I keep as honest a House as any in London . - One Night a Gentleman went up stairs with a Girl , and left his Gold Watch upon the Bed . I found it after he was gone , and gave him it the next time he came , and so I did by another Gentleman that left his Pocket Book with a 100 l. Bank Note in it . - Madam I 'll have my Money says I , before I go , D - ye but ye sha n't says she , and if you stay much longer I 'll have your Watch too . - But by good luck I had left my Watch at Home . I continued telling her I would not go without my Money , she threatned to fetch them that should silence me , and so she went away and I expected some Mischief for she had told me before that she kept a Soldier to assist her when People would not conform to the Rules of the House . But in a little time she came in again by herself , and said , What , ha n't you made an end of your Punch yet ? get you out of my House ? And so she dragg 'd me to the Door , and tossed my Hat and Cane after me . I was so disabled with Drinking that I could not defend my self ; I made shift to get Home , but being very sick I lay a Bed all that Day . The next Day I went to her House again to enquire after my Money , and then she said I had not been within her Doors that Night . - My Tweezer-Case was sent to me after she was committed to Newgate . Mr. Parrot . The Prosecutor told me he had got the Slut in Newgate . I went to see her there ; she said she was afraid this unhappy Affair with him would be the Ruin of her . That she had sent one to offer him all his Money to make it up ; and had likewise sent to a Man that keeps a little Baudy-Ken , and sells Ale in an Alley in Fleet-street , to tell him that if he did not return the Tweeser Case to the Prosecutor , she should be obliged to discover all . Defence . Jane Eccleston The Prisoner is my Mistress . On the twenty eighth of October about twelve at Night , the Prosecutor brought a Woman into our House , and I made them two Tiffs of Punch , and when the Punch was out they went away together ; he had his Hat on , and his Cane in his Hand . But all the time he was in our House , my Mistress was asleep in the Coffee-Room , and did not see him that Night , nor at any time afterwards till he came and took her up . James Hill , Watchman . Between one and two in the Morning , going up Hind Court , I found a Hat , and looking forward , I saw this Gentleman standing as if he was making Water . I asked him if he had lost his Hat , he said yes , and his Cane too . I found it and gave it him , and asked him where he lived . He said , in Nevil 's Alley in Fetter Lane . I went home with him , and at parting he said , he did not know but he might be one thousand Pound the worse for that Night 's Work . Q . Was he drunk ? Hill . I leave the honourable Court to judge of that . Q . What sort of a House does the Prisoner keep ? Hill . I can not say as to that , for I watch without Doors and not within - I do not know of any Disturbances - in this way - once indeed the Constable was called , about a Trifling Affair of a Boy 's losing two Guineas . Q . What Reputation has the House ? Hill It is very hard for a poor Watchman to give a Character of a House-keeper . Q . What do you mean by trifling with the Court ? Hill . Why she does keep a - Bawdy-house . Rebecca Serjeant . I live in the Country - at Ratcliff-Cross . On Friday the last of October , Boalled at the Prisoner 's House , and there the Proecutor came in for a Dish of Coffee , and asked her if he did not leave twenty two Guineas with her last Night ? She said no . Why then says he , I was robbed ; and he wanted her to make it up , but she said she would not if it cost her Life . Alphonso Gilbert The Prosecutor said , he would not have prosecuted her if she would have given him part of his Money . James Abram , Ticket-Porter in Castle Yard . She is a very honest Gentlewoman as any in the World , she has dealt with me for Oranges and Lemons . Elizabeth Burton . I wash and nurse , and get my Bread honestly at her House , and never saw no Disorders . Elizabeth Pearson . I live opposite to her , and she always lived very quiet and sedate , and orderly .

I happened upon these two Women in Long Acre , and they asked me to go to their Lodging in Earl 's Court , in Drury lane ; I was unwilling to go , but they said it was a very civil House . So they took me up one pair of Stairs , and ordered a Bowl of Punch , and a Fire to be made . I grew uneasy , and was for coming away . for I did not much like them ; but they shut the Door , and kept me with them an Hour longer than I would have been if I could have helped it . I had no disorderly Dealings with them , though they did what they could to bring me to it , for they took up their Coverings , and shewed me what Ware they had , and then they would needs examine mine - When the Punch was out , they called for Drams , we drank three Quarterns of Brandy , and then I paid the Reckoning . I had Silver in my Pocket , and Gold in my Fob . As I was going down Stairs , they knocked out the Candle , and the Landlady went out with me pretending to shew me the way to my Quarters . We had not gone one hundred Yards before I mist five Guineas , and a Moidore out of my Fob . Landlady , says I , what sort of People do you keep in your House ? I have lost my Money ; sure you have not , says she , but if it is so I will go back and see you righted . But instead of going back , she took me down a contrary way to lose me , when a Man hearing me complain of losing my Money , said , why do not you lay hold of her Countryman ? And with that she run away , but tumbled down , near her own House , and so we took her . Upon which the two Prisoners came out and swore and called us all to Naught .

We found Ann Evans asleep on the Stairs at the Hamburgh Coffee house in Drury-lane , and carried her to the Round-house , she own 'd that Ann Allen had gave her two Shillings of the Money to pay her Lodging , and that they were to share the rest in the Morning , and told us that Allen was gone home again .

On Monday Night , I was at the Golden Lyon in Russel-street Covent-Garden , and lost Four Guineas at the Bar . I went away and returned in half an Hour , and took the Money again . The Prisoner and another Person were then there , and saw me receive it . I observed that they kept an Eye on me , which made me suspect them ; It was then about Ten a Clock , I went over to the Kings Arms , and they followed and staid till near twelve . Next Day the Prosecutor told me that he had been rob 'd and describ 'd one of the Men . On Wednesday I went again to the Lyon , and saw the same two Persons . Mr. Ellis ( Sir Robert Walpole 's Steward ) coming in I said to him . By Mr. Bardins Description one of those Men must be one of them that rob 'd him . I sent to the Play-house for the Prosecutor , and in a little time he came and went to the Fire-side , looked at the Prisoner , and seized him . Prisoner . He told me Mr. Bardin would not prosecute , if I would give him 100 l. Mr. Taylor . A Message was left at Drury-lane Play-house , to desire me to come to the Prisoner . When I went , I asked him what he had to say , and he said he could get a Friend to be bound to raise him 100 l. If Mr. Bardin would not Prosecute ; I bid him speak to Mr. Bardin himself , for I would have nothing to do with it . Edward Thomas . I was at a Publick house by Covent-Garden , where the Prisoner was drinking in the next Box to me . In an Hour the prosecutor came in , and turning his Back to the Fire , looked wishfully on the Prisoner , and then reaching over took him by the Shoulder , and said , You are the Man that robb 'd me . Sir , says the Prisoner , you 're mistaken . Prisoner . Did not you see me at the Rose-Tavern in Bridges-street , on Tuesday Morning , from between Twelve and One till Four . Did you not bett with me there , and then go to King 's Coffee-house . Mr. Thomas . No I saw you there between Three and Four , but not sooner . Prisoner . I have Witnesses to my Character .

I have known him about eighteen Months , my Acquaintance begun with a view of purchasing part of his Estate . Ralph Hall . I am his Brother in-law . He was bound apprentice to the Devil , and behaved extreamly well in that Service . David Odell . I have known him seven or eight Years , We were four Years Fellow-servants to Mr. Goosetry , the Master of the Devil , in which time , Mr. Goosetry had not any Servant of whom he had a better Opinion than of the Prisoner .

That upon missing the Goods , he examined her , and she confest that she had delivered them to the Prisoner . who had pawned great part of them to Thomas Harris , or Harrison , a pawn-Broker in Mansel street , Goodman 's Fields . Mr. Brown went to Harrison 's to enquire for the Goods ; Harrison refused to produce them till he had the Money they were pawned for , and the Interest of it was paid down . Mr. Brown paid two Pound , sixteen Shillings , and two Pence for a Coat , a Wastcoat , a pair of Breeches , a pair of Stockings , and three Water-plates . He saw then several other Goods of the Prosecutor 's , which Harrison would not part with , except he brought more Money . The Prosecutor upon this , obtained a Warrant from Mr. Baron Thomson ; and Mr. Brown taking a Constable with him , and shewing Harrison the Warrant , he notwithstanding would not so much as open his Drawers , nor suffer them to see the very Goods Mr. Brown had seen before , when he paid for what he took away .

Anna Maria Thorn , the Elder , was indicted for the Murder of Anna Maria Thorn , the Younger , aged fifteen Years , by shutting her up in a cold Room in the House of John Falkner , a silk Dyer , and there keeping her from March the twenty fifth till November the seventh following , without Fire , sufficient Meat , Drink , and other Things , necessary to nourish and preserve her Life , for want of which Necessaries , she languished from the said twenty fifth of March , to the said seventh of November , and then miserably perished and died . She was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Thomas Falkner . I live at the Corner of the Roll 's Buildings in Fetter lane . A Fortnight after Lady-Day , the Prisoner came to lodge at my House , with her three Daughters , Dorothy the eldest , Charlotte the second , and Anna Maria the Deceased , who was youngest , and about fifteen Year 's old . They staid till November following , when Anna Maria died . In two or three Days after they came , my Wife , and Maid , told me they miss Victuals out of the Closet , and watching to see how it went , saw the Deceased come out of the Closet . I ordered the Cupboard Door to be locked , and then she came to them , and asked for Victuals , and said she was almost starved . I bid my Wife give her some Bread and Cheese , or Butter - It was five or six Weeks after this , the Deceased complained she had had no Victuals for two Days , but a Bit of Liver . I willing to examine into the Matter , peeped through a Slit in the Partition , and saw the Prisoner and Miss Dony [ Dorothy ] sitting at Dinner , and Miss Charlotte , and the Deceased standing by them , trembling . The Prisoner gave the Deceased a Bit of Bread , and about half an Ounce of Meat . I looked another time when they had pickled Pork for Dinner , and after the Pork was taken away , the Deceased had a Bit of cold Liver , as big as my two Fingers . When her Mother gave her Victuals , she commonly used to eat it cautiously ; but eating this Liver more eagerly , her Mother knocked her on the Shoulder , and said , Hussy ! how you cram it in ? Q . Did you ever expostulate with the Prisoner for using her Child thus ? Falkner . I did speak to her about it once ; and she told me I was a lying Scoundrel . I did not expect such an Answer , for excepting in this Case , she was as civil a Woman as ever came into a House - The Deceased died on the seventh of November . There was no Apothecary to attend her , nor was any of our Family called to see her , nor do I know that any other Person was - Her Mother had a Fire in the Parlor , but the Deceased was kept in a back Room , where there was no Fire , and where she lay upon a Bed without a Bedstead , and she has been locked in for two or three Days together . Q . Was not this in the Summer ? Falkner It was between April and November . Q . Was there no Carpet , or Matt under the Bed ? Falkner I do n't know . Q . Did not Charlotte lye in the same Bed ? Falkner . Yes . Q . And was not she used in the same manner ? Falkner . She could help her self , because she used to draw the Beer , and lay the Cloth - The Deceased told me she never had any Beer , but only Water - When she first came she looked something better than when she died , though from the first she was vastly thin , and emaciated : but when she was dead she looked like an Anatomy , as if she had nothing but Skin drawn over her Bones - I looked another time when she stood at the Table , and she had only a piece of cold Cabbage given her . Q . But might not she have had Meat given her , before or after you looked ? Falkner . The Mother , and Miss Doney dined first , before I saw them give her any thing - We have a Charcoal dust Tub that stood by her Garret Door , and under this Tub my Maid used to hide Victuals for her - One Day a Roll as hard as Iron was thrown over from the Roll 's Buildings into my Yard . I ordered my Maid to butter it , and put it under the Dust Tub ; she did . I saw the Girl take it out , and eat it greedily . Q . Did the Children work ? Falkner . Doney work 'd with her Needle , but Charlotte did most of the House-work . Q You say the Deceased was locked up in the back Room ? Did not she ( the Week before her death ) go out with Charlotte to see my Lord Mayor 's Shew . Falkner Yes ; they went out between nine and ten in the Morning , but I do n't know what time they came home . Q . Was not the Deceased walking about the House the Day before her death ? Falkner . My Journey-man told me she came down Stairs dangling her Arms , as if they were hung on with Wires . Ann Falkner . In two or three Days after the Prisoner came to our House , the Deceased asked my Maid for Victuals - Once I saw the Deceased come from my Closet , I asked her what she had been there for ; she owned she took a piece of Bread - We used to put Victuals for her under the Dust Tub . Council . When you gave her any Victuals did she eat it ? A. Falkner . She used to cram it in her Pocket - Q . And would she have done so if she had been ready to starve . A. Falkner . I have peeped through the Crevice , and seen the Prisoner give the Deceased Beef - and Pork - and Cabbage . But I think not sufficient . Q Do you know any thing of her being locked up ? A. Falkner . The Mother , and Miss Dony used to go to Market , and when the Basket Woman came with the Meat , Miss Charlotte used to lock the Door while she came down to the Woman . Q . Who is at the Expence of this Prosecution ? A. Falkner . The Parish , I think . Q . Who applied to the Parish ? A. Falkuer . I do not know - I went out on Friday Morning , and when I came home , my Girl , said , she believed Miss Nanny was a dying . Mrs. Funnel who likewise lodges in my House , went and knocked at the Prisoner 's Door , and said , Miss , How do you do ? Answer , was made , she is dead ! Mrs. Funnel , clapt her Hands , and said , O ye wicked Devils ! are ye not ashamed to starve the Child to death ? The Thing was soon noised about . and I went for the Searchers . When they came the Deceased was in bed , and they gave their Opinion , starved to death - The last Victuals I gave the Deceased , was two Months before she died . It was Bread and Cheese , and she pinned it up in her Petticoat for fear her Sister should take it from her - The Searchers said , the Bed was very clean , but not thick enough . Q Did you ever complain to the Prisoner , of her keeping the Child without sufficient Food ? A. Falkner . Yes ; I have said to her , Miss , looks very poorly , is she not well ? and she answered , Yes , very well , she eats more than Doe . I said no more , for the Child had begged me not to tell her Mother , because her Mother would beat her , as she did sometimes . When she told me that , I said to her , Miss Nanny , you are a great Girl . and if your Mother beats ye , I wonder I never heard you cry . Madam , says she , my Mamma stuffs her Handkerchief in my Mouth when she eats me . Mary Scot , Servant to Falkner We mist Victuals out of the Cupboard , the Deceased owned she took it . Then the Cupboard was locked and after that she always asked me for Victuals whenever she saw me . I have put Victuals under the Dust Tub , and seen her eat it greedily . I have peeped through the Crack , and seen her standing , when her Mother , and Doee were at dinner with boiled Pork , and Turneps , and saw them give her Turneps , but no Pork - I can not say , but they might have given her Meat before I looked - I found a hard Roll in our Yard , and laid it under the Dust Tub for her , but did not see her eat it . On a Saturday , when her Mother has been gone out , her Sisters have locked her in , and come down to me to drink Tea . Q . What is that to the Prisoner ? Mary Scot , But the Girl has complained to me , that her Mother starved her . Q . Where did her Mother keep the Victuals ? Mary Scott . In the Kitchen . Q . Was it lock 'd up ? Mary Scot , The Kitchen Door was - sometimes . Q . Could not the Girl get into the Kitchen ? Mary Scott Yes she used to go in to wash her Hands , and she might have got at the Victuals , but she said , she durst not meddle with it , for fear her Mother should beat her . - When the Prisoner 's Son Charles Rivers ( between thirteen and fourteen Years old , come home to her , she lock 'd him up too , in the Garret , and he complain 'd to me that he wanted Victuals , and said he had nothing but Bread and Water . Q Why did she lock him up . Mary Scott Because he had run away twice from his Master a Jeweller . Susan Robinson . I lived at Edmonton , I nursed the Deceas 'd and the Prisoners other Children . The Deceased was with me from a Month old till she was above thirteen Years Old , and she was very Healthful . When their Father Sir Geo Rivers dyed , ( which was a Year ago last August ) they went home to their Mother who then lived at Tottenham High-Cross - Sir George went by the Name of Thorn , and the Prisoner and he lived together as Man and Wife - I went to see the Deceas 'd on Twelfth-Day , and asked her if she was well . Her Mother said , Yes , she Eats and Drinks and Sleeps Well . In March following she ran away from her Mother , and came to my House at Edmonton . she look 'd like a Beggar and very thin and Poor , tho ' she was a healthy plump Girl before . She complain 'd that she had nor her belly full , I gave her some Victuals , and she Eat it very well , but as if she had been Starved . Q Were not the Prisoners Circumstances reduced , upon the Death of Sir George ? Sus n Robinson . I ca n't say as to that : But while I kept the Children , she saw them two or three times a Year , and she then behaved as a Mother should do . Q . Do you know Mr Elleker , who married a Daughter of Sir George 's ? Susan Robinson . When Charles Rivers left his Mother he came to me , and has Boarded with me . Mr. Elleker told me he believed I should be paid for maintaining of him . Mr. Buxton . I was present when Mr. Holloway and Mr. Freake opened the Body , and Mr. Freake found two or three Ounces of something in the Stomach , which he said look 'd like a Cordial Draught . Mr. Holloway . deposed that he found the Body much distempered , and by the Symptoms he believed the Death of the Deceas 'd might proceed from Natural Causes , and not from want Food . Defence . Dorothy Thorn . My Mother always shewed the like Favour and Affection to the Deceas 'd , as to me and my other Sister . The deceas 'd had the same Food as we , and the Victuals was never lock 'd up from her . She lay with Charlotte on a good warm Feather-Bed , in the warmest Room in the House . Indeed there was no Bedstead , but a double thick Cloth under it . She always look 'd thin , but never complain 'd of ill Usage , I never lock 'd her in , nor knew that she was lock 'd in . I never heard Mr. F. nor his Wife complain that she wanted , but indeed I have heard them say she looked thin . I told them she had a good Stomach , and wanted for nothing . I never heard them complain of her pilfering their Victuals till after she was Dead - Sir George Rivers was my Mothers Husband - My two Sisters lived with Nurse Robinson , but I lived at Home - On the Death of Sir George , my Mother 's Circumstances were reduced . But we had always Victuals enough . The deceas 'd complain 'd of a pain in her Legs , on the Wednesday before she dyed , and on Thursday she complained of all her Limbs . My Mamma sent for some Mutton to make her some Broth , which I did , and she eat three parts of a Bason full - in the Afternoon we had Tea . And I advised her to go to Bed , and so she did ; and my Sister Charley went to Bed with her . we thought it was only a Cold and so we did not send for an Apothecary , but my Mother gave her some Ale with Brandy and Sugar in it - She was Ill but one Day , and dyed at Ten a Clock on Friday Morning - There is a Law-Suit between Sir George 's other Children and us . Q Has your Mother any Estate for Life ? Dorothy Thorn . We do n't know till the Law-Suit is Ended . Charlotte Thorn . Depos 'd to the same Effect and added - I do n't believe in my Conscience , that she suffered any thing by Severity . I and my Sister were with her when she dyed . we did not call my Mother to see her dye because my Mother was Subject to Fits , and yet my Mother fell into Fits when she heard it . Mr. Freake . The Surgeon depos 'd to the same Effect , as Mr. Holloway had done . Ralph Harwood , Esq ; I have known the Prisoner ten or twelve Years in Tottenham ; she visited my Family in her Husband 's time , and always behaved very modestly . The Gentleman went by the Name of Thorn , and lived in a handsome manner , at the Rate of two Hundred Pounds a Year . They were visited by Lord Colrain , and the best of the Parish She was a most indulgent tender Mother that ever I saw ; nor did I ever see a more sober and sedate Woman , and was company for the best in the Parish - 'T is an unaccountable Prosecution . These two Children came home since her Husband died , and her Circumstances being then reduced , she lived more privately - She was as good a Woman as the best in the Parish . Since she was committed to Newgate , she has lain on the Commonside , and been reduced to the utmost Straits rather than make her Case known . Mr. Marsh . I have known her twenty Years , she was often at my House in Friday-Street , and I at hers at Tottenham , she was as much of a Gentlewoman , as ever I convers 'd with . Her eldest Daughter used to be drest up , and visit with her ; but the other two were at nurse , and drest plainer : She was no way cruel , angry , or hasty ; but meek and tender ; and I ca n't believe it posible , that she would starve her Child ; and I saw no manner of Distinction , that she made of her Children . Mr . Husband . In the twenty Years , that I have been Minister of Tottenham , she behaved well , was frequent at Divine Offices , came to Church and received the Sacrament , and was respected by the best part of the Parish ; I never heard that she was unkind to her Children , and ca n't believe she would starve any of them - I am sure I was mightily supriz 'd to hear such a Report . William Evans , Apothecary at Tottenham . All the Children have been under my Care : she was very indulgent to them , and often sollicitous in enquiring after their Health when they had the small Pox . I saw no partiality , nor could discern which of them was most her Favourite . Mrs. Dormer . I have known her twenty Years ; she lived seventeen Years at my Father 's House . I frequently visited her , and she me ; she kept one Child at home , but the rest were at nurse till a little before Christmass ; she often went to see them , and shewed a Concern when she heard they were ill - One time when the Deceased was not well , the Prisoner came to me , and said , poor Nanny has been very bad all Night with a violent Purging - and she desired me to lend her a Bottle of Red-Wine for her . Several others were ready to speak to her Character , but it was thought unnecessary . The Jury acquitted her . And the Court granted her a Copy of her Indictment . 48. Ralph Refue , was indicted for privately stealing one Guinea , from the Person of Edward Lerougetell , December 3 . Edward Lerougetell . Between four and five in the Afternoon , as I was coming down the Minories , the Prisoner stooped before me , and took up a Shilling , and asked me if it was not good . I told him I could not tell . He washed it , and said , he believed it was , and invited me to go and drink with him , but I refused , and told him I had Business to do . I went to the White Hart , and paid for a Gun , and Gun Barrel . And when I came out with my Goods , the Prisoner again invited me to drink . I still refused , but he still kept me company , and asked me what Countryman I was , and where I lodged . I said I came from Jersey , and lodged at John Simmons 's at Green Bank . He said , he was going that way I had got a Bible , & c under my Arm ; it was going to slip down , and I went to save it , upon which , he took it from me , and would needs carry it for me . When he had got it , he went into an Ale-house the Half-moon and Star in East Smithfield . I was obliged to follow him for my Bible . As soon as I went in I found another Man who was his Acquaintance , and they two went to Cards . The Prisoner sat close by me , and asked me to Cut . I told them I did not understand Cards , and had no mind to meddle with them . But however , they persuaded me to lay a Shilling upon the Game . I lost that and another , and then I won three Shillings , and at last I ventured fourteen Shillings out of a Guinea that I had in my Pocket . I grew very uneasy , and wanted to be going . I put my Hand in my Pocket to pay , and had got the Guinea between my Fingers , when the Prisoner husseld my my Hand , and said sit down , but presently I mist my Guinea The Prisoner , and his Companion jumpt up . The Landlady shut the Fore-door , and opened the Back Door to let them out . I went to follow them , but she stopt me , and said , I should pay the Reckoning before I went , or else I should leave my Goods . I accordingly left Goods to the value of thirty Shillings , and then pursued the Prisoner , and seized him in Nightingale Lane , and brought him back to the House , where when I came , they put out the Candles , and I fearing some mischief , shriek 'd out . At last I got a Constable , who carried the Prisoner before the Justice . The Prisoner told him that I laid the Guinea in the other Man 's Hand . Prisoner . And so you did . Edward Lerougetell . No . I did not . The Justice sent for the Landlady , and she said she saw no such thing . Then I must go back to the House to secure my Goods . So we all went back , and the Prisoner gave the Woman a Guinea , and said , Change that , and let 's drink to my Reformation . Benjamin Simpson . When the Prisoner was first at the House he had no Money , that I saw , but when he returned , he gave the Landlady a Guinea , and bid her change it , and drink to his Reformation . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 49. Jane Miner , was indicted for stealing a Watch value four Pound , a pair of Breeches value ten Shillings , and two Shillings and six Pence , the Goods and Money of John Dickson , in his House , March 10 . John Dickson . I went to an Ale-house in Drury Lane , where I met the Prisoner . We drank together , and went to another Ale house in Long Acre , where we staid till past twelve at Night . She said then it was so late , that she should be locked out of her Lodging . I told her she should be welcome to lie in my Maid 's Bed . So we went home together . I took her to the Maid 's Bed . She asked me where I lay , and I shewed her ; she said she liked that better , and so without any more to do , she undrest and went into it . I told her I would not lie out of my own Bed ; she answered , I might do as I would , but for her part she would stay where she was . I found there was no remedy , and so I went to bed to her . When I awaked in the Morning , my Lady was gone , and had taken my Breeches with her , and all that was in them : she could not get out at the Yard Door , but by the help of a Ladder , she found the way over the Wall . It was six Months before I could find her again ; and then she confest where she had sold my Watch , and to whom she had given my Breeches . Guilty 39 s. [ Branding . See summary . ] 50 , Charles Mechlin , was indicted for the Murder of Thomas Hallam , by thrusting a Stick into his left Eye , and thereby giving him one Mortal Wound of the Breadth of a quarter of an Inch , and Depth of one Inch and a half , May the 10th . of which mortal Wound he languished till the next Day and then Died . He was a Second time Indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Thomas Arne . I have the Honour to be Numberer of the Boxes of Drury-Lane Play-house under Mr. Fleetwood - On Saturday Night I deliver 'd my Accounts in the Property-Office , and then at eight at Night I came into the Scene-Room where the Players warm themselves , and sat down in a Chair at the end of the Fire - Fronting the Fire there 's a long Screen where five or six People may sit . The Play was almost done and they were making Preparation for the Entertainment , when the Prisoner came in and sat down next to me . And high Words rose between him and the Deceas 'd about a Stock-Wig for a disguise in the Entertainment , the Prisoner had play 'd in this Wigg the Night before , and now the Deceas 'd had got it . D - ye for a Rogue , says the Prisoner , What Business have you with my Wig ! I am no more a Rogue than your Self , says the Deceas 'd . Its a Stock Wig and I have as much right to it as you . Some of the Players coming in , they desired the deceas 'd to fetch the Wigg and give it to the Prisoner . The deceas 'd having found another Wig , he fetched the Wig in dispute , and gave it to the Prisoner , and said to him , Here is your Wig , I have got one that I like better . The Prisoner sitting by me , took the Wig , and begun to comb it out , and all seemed to be quiet for half a quarter of an Hour . But the Prisoner begun to grumble again , and said to the Deceased , G - D - ye for a black Guard scrub Rascal , How durst you have the Impudence to take this Wig ? The Deceased answered , I am no more a Rascal than your self . Upon which the Prisoner started up out of his Chair , and having a Stick in his Hand , he gave a full Longe at the Deceased , and thrust the Stick into his left Eye , and pulling it back again he looked pale , turn 'd on his Heel , and in a Passion , threw the Stick in the Fire . G - D - it ! says he , and turning about again upon his Heel , he sat down . The Deceased clapt his Hand to his Eye , and said it was gone through his Head : He was going to sink , and they set him in a Chair . The Prisoner came to him , and leaning upon his left Arm , put his Hand to his Eye , Lord ! cryed the Deceased , it is cut . No , says the Prisoner I feel the Ball roll under my Hand . Young Mr. Cibber came in , and immediately sent for Mr. Coldham the Surgeon . Prisoner . Did I shew any Concern afterwards . Arne . I believe he was under the utmost Surprize , by his turning about , and throwing the Stick in the Fire , and he shew 'd a further Concern , when he felt of the Eye-Ball . Thomas Whitaker . I am a Dresser in the House , under a Comedy player . On the Fryday Night the Prisoner asked me to lend him a Comedy-Wig to play Sancho , in the Fop 's Fortune . And the next Night , the Deceas 'd came and asked me for the same Wig . I told him I had it not , and bid him go to the other Dresser - As I was afterwards waiting in the Hall for my Money , the Prisoner came in , and asked the Deceas 'd for the Wig , the Deceas 'd answered that he should not have it , and the Prisoner reply 'd , you 're an Impudent Rascal , and ought to be can 'd for your Impudence . Mr. Mills , who was acting Juba , came and said . What 's the matter with you ? We ca n't play for the Noise you make , the Prisoner answer 'd , This Rascal has got a Wig that belongs to me . Mr. Mills said to the Deceas 'd , Hallam , do n't be impertinent , but give him the Wig . Hallam still refused , upon which , the Prisoner said , G - D - ye , such little Rascals ought to be made an example of , and so turn 'd out of the Room . I being drest in Shape , went up , and undrest . Mr. Woodford bid me bring down a Scimitar , which I did , but , when I came down I could not find him , and so I went into the Scene Room : The Deceased was then standing still between the Door and the Settle . The Prisoner was about three Yards from him , and starting up , he made a sudden Longe ( whether stepping or running , I ca n't say ) the Deceas 'd clapt his Hand to his Eye , and made a Reel , as if he was throwing himself into the Settle - The Prisoner seem 'd to relent . Mr. Cole . The Deceased came first into the Scene-Room , and complain 'd that the Prisoner had used him ill about a Comedy-Wig . The Prisoner soon followed , and said the Deceased had used him ill and impertinently , and he insisted upon having that Wig - They went out separately . The Deceased came in again . Mr. Fabian , the Author of a Farce to be acted that Night , Mr. Mills , and others , advised the Deceas 'd to see the Prisoner have the Wig , and Mr. Kitchin the Property Man promis 'd to help him to a better . The Deceased fetch 'd the Wig and gave it to the Prisoner , and then Mr . Kitchen gave another Wigg to the Deceased . The Deceased held out this Wig to shew it , and said he lik 'd it better than the other , you saucy impertinent Rascal , says the Prisoner , I wonder how such a litle Scoundrel dared to take a Wig out of my Dressing-Room ; the Deceased told him , he had it of the Dresser - D - ye you Dog , says the Prisoner , do ye prate ? And rising up from the Settle , he push 'd at the Deceased , who then stood stock still , between me and the Settle - I was so near him , that I was afraid my own Eye would have been hurt ; he reel 'd , and I catched him in my Arms . Council . Who does the Dressing Room where the Wig was kept , belong to . Mr. Cole . Not to the Deceased . Q . Has every one a particular Room to dress in ? Mr. Cole . There were three or four who drest in that Room , but the Deceased did not belong to it . But he said the Dresser gave him the Wig - I believe the Dresser 's Name is Greenwood . Francis Lee . The Deceased came into the Scene-Room , and said the Prisoner had used him like a Pick-pocket , about a Wig . Mr. Mills . and the Author , and others advised him to go up and fetch him the Wig ; he went out , the Prisoner came in , and said the Deceased was a Scoundrel ; the Deceased came in , and gave him the Wig : Mr . Kitchen call 'd the Deceased to the end of the Room , and lent him another Wig ; he shew 'd this Wig , and said he would not change with the Prisoner , for he had got a better : The Prisoner answer 'd , you are a Scoundrel for taking it at all . The Deceased reply 'd , No more a Scoundrel than your self . Some other Words passing , the Prisoner rose up , and I think said , D - ye , you little Dog do ye prate , and then gave him the Blow . He clapt both his Hands to his Eye , and cry 'd , O ' Lord ! I believe my Eye is put out , and would have fal'n in the Fire , if Mr. Cole had not catch 'd him . When he was set down , I asked him how he did ; Lord ! said he , I believe my Eye-ball is shev 'd to the other side of my Head . I believe the Prisoner had him by the Hand , all the while the Surgeon was dressing him - He lived 'till six the next Night . Ellis Roberts . I came in , when the Deceas 'd had receiv 'd the other Wig . He said he liked this as well as that the Prisoner had . You are an impudent Scoundrel , says the Prisoner , for taking it out of my Shift ( that is , his dressing Place ) - No more a Scoundrel than your self , says the Deceas 'd , and you are one for calling me Ye impudent Rascal , do you prate ? reply 'd the Prisoner , and rising up , made a Longe , and push 'd at him . Thomas Salway . I was sitting at the end of the Settle , which will hold five or six People . The Deceased stood by me , and said , If he , ( the Prisoner ) had had a mind for the Wig , he might have asked me for it in a civil Manner , and not have attack 'd me like a Pick pocket . The Prisoner said , you lie ; the Deceased return 'd I do n't lie , or else , you lie ; upon which , the Prisoner got up , and I think made one Step , and said , ye little Rascal do ye prate ? or some such Words ; and then made a push at him with a stick , which enter 'd his Eye , and made a Noise like a squashing . He clapt his Hand to his Eye , and the Blood ran down his Face ; he totter 'd ; but I was so shock 'd and frighted that I had not power to catch him , but went out of the Room : When the Push was made , he was standing still , about three Yards from the Prisoner . Council . Did he aim at any particular Place ? Thomas Salway . He seem 'd to be in too great a Passion for that . Prisoner . Was it not a Stick necessary for my part , as a Spanish Servant ? Thomas Salway . Yes - The Deceased stood close to my right Shoulder . Prisoner . Which side of him was towards me when I pushed ? Thomas Salway . His full Face . Prisoner . Did not you say , What a passionate Man are you to do this Mischief ? and did not I answer , Good God ! What will not a Man do in Passion , when he knows not what he does ? Thomas Salway . There might be such Words . Mr. Coldham . Surgeon . On the tenth of May , in the Evening , I was sent for , and drest the Deceased - He died next Day , and I opened the Skull , and found the Stick had passed through the thin Bone that contains the Eye , into the Brain - That Bone is extream thin , and can make but little resistance . Had the Blow been elsewhere , it might have had a less fatal Effect . I was astonished that a Man should die by such an Instrument - when I first attended him , the Prisoner shewed much Concern , and desired me to take all possible care of him . George Carpenter . I know nothing of the Affair , but only was bound over to prosecute , because he had no friends . Defence . Prisoner . I plaid Sancho the Night before , and the Wig I then used was proper for the New Play , and absolutely necessary for my Character ; the whole force of the Poet 's Wit depending on the lean meagre Looks of one that wanted Food . This Wig therefore being so fit for my purpose , and hearing that the Deceased had got it , I said to him , You have got the Wig I plaid in last Night , and it fits my Part this Night - I have as much right to it as you have , says he . I told him I desired it as a Favour : he said , I should not have it . You are a Scoundrel , says I , to deny me , when I only ask that as a Favour , which is my right . I am no more a Scoundrel than your self , says he , and , and I went to the Prompter 's Door to see for Mr. Cibber . Mean while the Deceased went into the Scene Room , and said , that I had used him like a Pick-pocket - The Author persuaded him to let me have the Wig , and the Property-Man brought him another Wig . He threw the first Wig at me . I asked him why he could not as well have done that before . He answered , because you used me like a Pick-pocket . This provoked me , and rising up , I said , D - ye for a Puppy , get out . His Left-side was then towards me , but he turned about unluckily , and the Stick went into his Eye . Good God ! says I , What have I done ! and threw the Stick in the Chimney . He sat down , and said to Mr. Arne 's Son ( who was drest in Women 's Cloaths ) whip up your Coats ye little Bitch and Urine in my Eye ; but he could not , and so I did . I begged them to take the Deceased to the Bagnio , but Mrs. Moore said , she had a Room where he should be taken care of . I had then no thought that it would prove his End , but feared that his Eye was in Danger . But next Morning I saw Mr. Turbut , who advised me to keep out of the way , or I should be sent to Jail - I begged him to get the Assistance of a Physician , and gave him a Guinea , which was all the Money I had - From the Beginning of the Quarrel to the end , it was but ten Minutes , and there was no Intermission . Robert Turbut . I had played that Night , and was in the Scene Room when the Deceased came in , and seemed flush 'd , and said , Mechlin has used me like a Pick-pocket . I had this Wig of Mrs. Greenwood , the Dresser , and now he wants it ; but I think it is as proper for my Character as for his - The Prisoner then came in , and demanded it . Upon which , in a merry way , it was put to the Question , which of them should have it , and it was agreed that the Prisoner should . Mr . Kitchen came in , and said , Here is another Wig . The Deceased then tost the former Wig to the Prisoner , who said to him , why could not you have done this before . He answered , because you used me like a Pick-pocket - You lye , says the Prisoner ; and you lye , says the Deceased - You are a Scoundrel , says one , and You are a Scouudrel , says another . At last the Prisoner rising up , said , Ye Puppy , get out , and pushed at him , but I believe not with any particular Aim . Mr. Rich , Mr. Fleetwood , Mr. Quin , Mr. Ryan , Mr. Thompson , Mr. Mills , Mr. Lessley , Mr. Black , Mr. Fern , appeared to the Prisoner 's Character , and deposed that he was a Man of a quiet and peaceable Disposition . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 50. Thomas Jones , was indicted for stealing seven Pound of Sugar , the Goods of Thomas Freeman , October 30 . Acquitted . 51.

Martha Weston , was indicted for receiving four Shifts , and one Shirt , part of the said Goods , knowing them to be stolen . Sarah Ackers . At five in the Evening , I locked my Stair Foot Door ( but not the Street Door ) and went over the way . I returned about six , and found my Stair Foot Door open , and a Gown upon the Stairs . Coming into my Room I mist my Goods , and found a Man 's Hat upon the Floor . I was informed that Sarah Miller ( who buys and sells in Rag Fair ) had pawned such Goods as I had lost . I met with her , and she told me she had them from Belmosset , and Sears . I found some of them pawned at Mr. Martins , against White Chappel Church . Some she sold to the Prisoner Weston . The Constable went with a Warrant to search for the rest , at the three Blue Balls in Mansell Street in Goodman 's Fields , but the Pawn-broker would not let him search . Sarah Miller . Belmosset , and Robert Sears , and Jane Stone , came into Well-street , Rag-Fair , at seven or eight at Night , and desired me to sell these Goods . It was too late to sell them , and so Belmosset gave me and Jane Stone a Shilling a-piece to pawn them . I sold four Shifts and a Shirt for four Shillings , to he Prisoner Mary Weston , who keeps a Lodging House . Some I pawned at Martins , and Jane Stone pawned the rest at Peter Harrison 's - I think his Name is Peter - a Pawn-broker by the New Play-house in Goodman 's Fields - He would not let us search for them - afterwards , though we had Justice Farmer 's Warrant . * * See the Trial of Lydia King , above Mr . Brain . I took Miller and Belmosset . He drew a Knife upon me , and swore D - his Blood he would not go with me - I told him he was charged with breaking open a House in Wapping . He said I need not tell him that , for he knew what it was for . James Canny . I had a Warrant against Sears , and - Orchard , for another Fact , and they were carried before Justice Farmer , but no body appearing to prosecute , they were discharged . But this House being robbed , the Justice sent me to enquire for these Men , and Martha Weston - I happened to see Belmosset just as Mr . Brain had seized him , and so I assisted to secure him . He swore D - him he had nothing of the Goods , but an old Cloak , and a Shilling . We went to Martin the Pawn-broker , and he readily shewed us what Goods he had . But Harrison refused to let us search , though we had a Warrant ; and he told us , if the Justice himself was to come he should not search his House . Belmosset was found guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. but Stone and Wheston were acquitted . [ Transportation .

William Wreathock , Peter Chamberlain , James Russet , alias Rushead , George Bird , the younger , and Gilbert Campbell . were indicted for assaulting Nathaniel Lancaster , Doctor of Laws , on the Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Gold-Watch , two Iron Keys , six pieces of Foreign Silver-Coin , three pieces of Foreign Gold-Coin , and one Shilling and six Pence , June the 11th . 72. Gilbert Campbel , was a second time indicted for Perjury , in his Evidence given at the Tryal of Thomas Maccray , in July last . Dr. Lancaster . On Wednesday the 11th of June , passing in a Hackney-Coach from little Chelsea , towards Buckingham-house , I was robb 'd by a Man since known to me by the Name of Maccray , at seven Minutes past nine in the Evening . He took from me a Gold-Watch , two Keys , some foreign Silver and Gold Coin , and one Shilling and six Pence in Money , one Window of the Coach was drawn up ( I think it was Canvas ) so that I could not see if any Body was on that side . Maccray attacked me on the other-side between the Coach and Hedge , at his going off he bid the Coachman drive slow . When he was gone , I got out of the Coach , and saw three , four or five Men on Horse-back in the Road , I ca n't exactly say at what distance they were but I believe one might be about fifty Yards of , another a hundred , another two Hundred , and another three Hundred . I held up both my Hands thus to alarm them . They did not seem to regard me . but rode on towards London , which was contrary to the way which Maccray went . I met with some Persons on Foot , and told them I had been robb 'd , I described the Man and Horse , and desired them to pursue him . Wreathock . When Maccray was on his Trial for this Robbery , did you then mention that you saw any other Persons on the Road . Dr. Lancaster . No , nor did I suspect that he had any Companions . Campbell . Did your Reverence know the Faces of any of those People ? Dr. Lancaster . No , not one of them . Campbell . Did you ever give any Money to Julian Brown 's Wife ? Dr. Lancaster . Finding Brown in a very weak Condition , I allow 'd him Meat and Drink for his Subsistence , but no more than was absolutely necessary . I consulted some Lawyers , and looked into Law-Books myself on this Occasion . Brown 's Confession was made before Col Deveil , before I knew any thing of it , and the Colonel advised me to go and see him . I said I had been so ill treated , that my Life was in danger , and I had often fled for it . However , I went , and I laid before Brown in the strongest light I was able , the danger of Perjury both here and hereafter He told me among other things , that Wreathock offered him One Hundred Guineas to kill me . Wreathock . Did you ever see me before this Day ? Dr. Lancaster . No . Wreathock , Did you never say , you believed none of us were ever guilty of Robbing on the Highway ? Dr. Lancaster . No . Wreathock . Did you not jump out of the Coach immediately and give a Gardners Boy a Crown to pursue Maccray only . Dr. Lancaster . I did promise him something to drink , he told me , that he saw the Man rob me , but there was not a Word said , as to what number of Men there were upon the Road . Wreathock . Did not you and the Boy pursue Maccray to the Turnpike . - This I do to strengthen the Boys Evidence . - Council . We shall now call Julian Brown - He still is in a weak Condition , his Voice is low and he speaks but bad English , but I hope if be takes time , and the People are quiet we shall understand him . Julian Brown . I believe I can speak de Anglish so vel as to be understand , I ave know Wreatock Sis or Saven Mont - On de 11th Day of June . I go to his 'ouse in de 'atton Garden near eight in de Afternoon . He vas at his Door , and he say , I be very glad you come , I was justa now to go to your 'ouse . I say to him , vat you want vid me , and he say , take you dis Horse and ride slow to 'Oborn , and I shall over take you , and you shall meet to Shelsea Road , and dare vill be Maccray and Peter Shamberlain , and Jemmy Ruffit , and Campbell , and Bird , and You , and I . And den ve shall rob a Gentleman , and ave his Money . So I take a de Horse , and he meet a me by Moumot-street . and ve go togader to Shelsea-Road , and dare ve find Maccray first , and he say , Stand a you dis a vay at a distaunce . I vait for a Doctor in a Coash , and I shall rob him and ave his Money . Wreathock . He can speak louder if he will , for as bad as he pretends to be , he eat a whole Fowl yesterday for his Dinner . Council . I will ask you particularly , who was there with you in Chelsea-Road - Was Wreathock there ? Brown . Yes he was one . Council . Name the Rest . Brown . Shamberlain Two , Ruffit Three , Bird Four , Campbell Five , and I and Maccray , dat vas Seven . Council . And are you Positive , these were all there ? Brown . Yes , very Positive - Wreatock ve call de General , because he gives Instrution - His Reverence de Doctor come in de Coash at seven minutes after Nine . His Reverence sit vid his Back towards the Horses , and dare vas a Gentleman and a Gentlewoman sit togader on de oder side , den Maccray come from de side of de Hedge and bid de Coash Stop ! Stop !

Wreatock vas den at a leetel distaunce , and Maccray run to him and trow de Vast into his Hat , Wreatock put it into his Vastcoat Pockate , and he say , ve must not go all togadar , and his Reverence come out of de Coath , and hold up his Hands , and cry Highwayman ! Tees ! - I did see a leetel Boy by the Coash , but I no take mush notice . Dr. Lancaster . I said to Brown , before I go on with this Prosecution , you must convince me by some private token that you was there . And then he told me this Sign , of holding up my Hands , and this encouraged me to prosecute . Brown . Ven his Reverence 'old up his Hands , I vas so far from him as to dat Vall in de Yard . Shambarlain vas in de middle of us , and he say to Maccray , D - you , vy you no blow his Brains out - Ven de Coash was rob , I vas so far off as twice dat Vall in de Yard - Bird , Campbell , Wreatock , and Maccray go all four togadar , and Chamberlain and Ruffit , go togader , and they say to me , You go that vay , I go vid mine self , and miss no Gallop .

Bird Did you not on Maccray 's Trial , Swear that you and Maccray were at an Alehouse in Holborn at the time this Robbery was committed ? Brown . Yes , I did , I do n't deny it , but there , I forswore myself . Q . How came you say so ? Brown . Wreatock , had all de Witnesses at de Kings-Head in 'Oborn , and said he you 'd give five Guineas a piece to swear for Maccray , and dere vas to be six Witnesses in de Hall , and four in de Court , I said , it is very hard for me to forswear myself . And he answer 'd G - D - ye ! if you do n't , dey will swear your Life away . But ven I vas Sick nine Weeks , I tink it vas a very vicked ting to rob his Reverence and forswear myself , and so I make de general Confession and Information to clear my Conscience . Council . What time of Night was it when you was at the Tavern with Wreathock . Brown . From Ten till Three in the Morning . Council . I do n't mean the Night when the Witnesses met , but the Night of the Robbery ? Brown . Ven I came to Wreatock 's house vid de Horse , it was two or three minutes past Ten , and den ve go directly to de Tavern , Campbell . Did we go towards London , or Chelsea ? Brown .

No , he was before it , and den dey vent to London and Maccray vid them . Campbell . We shall contradict that . Brown . Dere is no two suth Rogues in Europe to find false Vitness . Wreathock . How came you acquained with me ? Brown . In your own House . Campbell brought me Campbell . Did Mac Cray ride towards London when he had robb 'd the Coach ? Brown . Wreatock , Campbell , Bird and Mac-Cray , all four come togader toward London . Campbell . The Doctor swears Mac Cray went directly from the Coach the contrary way . Brown . He might turn off anoder way , when he was out of my sight . Wreathock . Did I or my Footman give you the Horse at my Door ? Brown . Wreatock did , and he give me two Pistols just as I go avay . Q , How came you to make the Discovery ? Brown . I vas nine Weeks very ill and bad , and expect my self to die , and I tink it very hard upon my Conscience , to rob his Reverance , and to lose my Soul and forswear my self : So I sent for Justice Deveil , and he say to me , Take care - consider - recollect - speak noting but de Trute , I beg you , for it is a great matter . He tell me dis an Hour before he write - I sent for de Doctor , and his Reverance tell me , Speak de Trute , I beg you for God 's sake , and noting else ; and so he say , fivety times every Day - I make dis Discovery to comfort my Conscience , for I tink of God to be my Judge . Justice Deveil . On the thirty first of October , while I was at Dinner with a Gentleman , a ( Justice of the Peace , ) I received a Letter from one Wolham a Prisoner in the King 's Bench ; I at first suspected it might be a Trap laid for me , but considering it was in a Prison , I took the Justice with me , and went . Wolham said he had a Man ready to carry me to Julian Brown ; when I heard his Name , I suspected a Design to murder me , but yet , as I was willing to know what he had to say , I took four Men well arm 'd and the Justice with me , and went to Brown 's House : I found him in a very weak Condition , he said he sent for me to take his Information ; I charg 'd him to be cautious , and not to accuse any Man wrongfully , for it was a Matter of the utmost consequence . He answered , that what he desired to do , was to purge his Conscience . I was above three Hours with him , tho ' I could scarce bear the smell of him and the Room . Wreathock . What 's his Character ? Deveil . That he has been a very ill Man , but this was on his Repentance . Juryman . Did the Doctor mention the signal before the Confession was made ? Dr. Lancaster , I never told that Circumstance to any one living , till after Brown 's Confession . Campbell . Brown might have that Signal from Mac Cray . Dr. Lancaster . Mac Cray did not see that Signal . Campbell . The Doctor lifted up his Hands to some Persons ( as he himself has sworn ) and they might speak of it to others . The Defence of the Prisoners . Wreathock . I have been an Attorney these eighteen Years , and have acquired in this Capacity a small Fortune . I have lived ( in Hatton-Garden ) eleven Years , in as much Credit as Dr. Lancaster himself I kept two Clerks , a Footman , and Women Servants and have constantly been in a Hurry of Business , and therefore under no Temptation to hazard my Life , by robbing on the Highway . I was not taken , but surrendered my self , which it can not be suppos 'd I would have done , had I known my self to be guilty : It is not indeed impossible , but far from being probable , that seven Men should ride out together to commit a Robbery . Brown says he has known me six or seven Months ; it 't is six Months since this Fact was done , and 't is unaccountable that on such a short Acquaintance , I should venture to accompany him in such an Expedition , and espe-cially that I should do this in a Place where I was likely to meet some that knew me for having an Estate at Fulham , I often pass 'd that Road . The Impatience of the Town for these Trials , obliges us to defer the Second Part for several Days . THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE Sessions of the Peace , and Oyer and Terminer , FOR THE City of LONDON , AND County of MIDDLESEX , ON Wednesday the 10th , Thursday the 11th , Friday the 12th , Saturday the 13th , and Monday the 15th of December , 1735. in the Ninth Year of His MAJESTY 's Reign . Being the First SESSIONS in the Mayoralty of the Right Honourable Sir JOHN WILLIAMS , Knt . Lord-Mayor of the City of LONDON , in the Year 1735 . NUMBER I . PART II . LONDON : Printed for J. ROBERTS , at the Oxford-Arms in Warwick-Lane . M.DCC.XXXV . ( Price Six Pence . ) The PROCEEDINGS , & c. WREATHOCK , none of us were ever charged with any thing of this nature , before the Birth of this execrable Device , for such I hope it will appear to be . 'T is very strange that a Man should this foolishly , and without being under the least necessity , put his Life into the Power of others . We should call the Coachman , the Gardener 's Boy , the Turnpike Men , and others , to prove , there were not ( tho ' Brown swears the Truth there must have been ) six or seven Men on the Road when the Robbery was Committed . And has to myself in particular , I shall prove that I was at the Kings-Head in Holborn from eight that Evening , till twelve at Night - What I observ 'd as to the time of my acquaintance with Brown , has been only from his own Words but in fact , I never knew nor so much as saw him till about five Months ago , he was tryed in this Court for a Rape . Campbell . The six first Witnesses we shall call are Persons who were upon the Spot , and their Evidence will be in behalf of us all . Henry Duck , Coachman . I drove the Coach when Dr. Lancaster was robb 'd . There was he and another Gentleman and a Gentlewoman in the Coach , but how they sat , or whether the Windows were drawn up or not , I can not say . Just by the Coach side when the Robbery was committed there was a Soldier and a Woman , who went towards Chelsea after the Highwayman went away , and I saw no other Persons . The Doctor got out at Bloody-Bridge , where two Men met him . He spoke to them and he and they went towards Chelsea . After the Highwayman , I saw no Horses on the Road , till I came to London , and if there had been any I must have seen them for I turn 'd my Head and look 'd about . I know not the Day of the Month or Week , but it was between eight and nine a Clock . A clear Evening but duskish . Campbell . I would ask the Doctor if this is not the Coachman . Dr. Lancaster . I do n't remember that I observ 'd the Coachman 's Face . But I afterwards saw such a Coach , and enquiring who drove it at that Time , the Master of the Coach produced his Man . Council . Why did not you call him for a Witness at Maccray 's Trial ? John Moore , the Gardener 's Boy As I was coming out of the Red Lyon Ale-house in the Kings Road , at nine or little after , I saw a Man turn from the Coach , and I saw no other Horseman on the Road . I followed the Coach to Bloody-Bridge , where my Master lives , and where it stopt , and the Doctor got out , and told the Landlord of the House there , that he had been robb 'd , by a single Highwayman , and said he would give a Crown a Piece to some Men to pursue him - There was a Soldier and a Woman hard by . Wreathock . If there had been any Horsemen on the Road , do you think you should have seen them . Boy . Yes , I must seen them , for the Road is but twenty three foot Wide . Wreathock . Could not you see a quarter of a Mile , both Ways from the Lyon ? Boy . No , not above three hundred Yards , for it was dusky , and the Road is not Straight . Juryman . Is there not one turning to Chelsea , and one to Chelsea-Common , near that House . Boy . Yes there is - It was a Haizey Evening . and it had rained that Afternoon . Q . To the Coachman . Did you see the Highwayman come out from the Hedge ? William Coats . Apothccary in Chelsea . I neither saw the Robbery nor the Coach , but Mr. Jones who keeps the White-Hart in the Kings-Road near Chelsea , came to me and said , a Gentleman at his House wanted to see me . I went with him and by the way a Man rid by us towards London , in such a manner that I suspected him , going a little farther I met two or three Men on Foot , in pursuit of him and presently after , I met the Doctor , who said he had been robb 'd , and enquired if we had met such a Man , This was about one hundred and fifty or near two hundred Yards , from the place where I heard the Robbery was done . I saw no other Person on the Road - It was a clear Night but it had been rainy . Richard Jones . ( who was with Mr. Coats ( depos 'd , to the same Effect John Baker . Attorney . I live in Fulham Parish . In the close of the Evening it was near nine a Clock ( but as light as it is now at half an hour past four ) I went over the Fields with a Gentleman , on Foot from Hidepark Corner , and going towards Bloody-Bridge , there was a Crowd of People about the House . They said a Person had been robb 'd presently a Horseman came full speed from Fulham . One of the Company said he believed that was the Man upon which the Gentleman who was with me , having a Bayonet at the end off his quarter Staff . Stopt the Horse and examined the Man . He told us he was no such Person as they took him to be , but that he had met a Man riding the other way - I saw no other Horseman on the Road . Mary Lovell . I keep the House at Bloody-Bridge . I was sitting in my Kitchen , which is next the Road . and hearing a Coach stop I went to the Door . The Doctor came out of the Coach , and asked if I had any Men in the House , for the had been robb 'd . My House was as far from where the Robbery was done as it is from hence to Newgate-street . I saw no body in the Road , but those that belong 'd to the Coach , and a Soldier and a Woman that past by my Door . Wreathock . As you sat in the Kitchen next the Road , if any Horsemen had past by , do you think you should have heard them ? M. Lovell . The Road is but five Yards broad in that place - it had been a dull wet Day . John Thompson . I was Smoaking a Pipe at my Door , and talking to an old Man , when a Horseman came riding full speed , towards Fulham : Says I , that Fellow rides as if he were drunk or Mad - I saw no Horseman on the Road but him ; two Men on foot came up , and said that Man had robb 'd a Person , between the lion and Bloody-Bridge and that the Parson between the Red Lion and Bloody Bridge , and that the Person would give a reward for pursuing him , they pull 'd of their Coats , and left them in my House - The Doctor than came up , and told us he had been robb 'd . The Turupike is just above my House , and was open , I stay 'd at the Door till ten at Night . Richard Thomas . I was at the Red Lyon in the Kings-Road , and was called out to pursue a Highwayman , and on the promise of Crown , I followed to Fulham Bridge , but saw no Horses except one in a Chaise , and a Cart Horse , which a Man was riding on near Fulham . Wreathock . On the eleventh of June , I attended the Court of to try a Cause before my Lord Hardwick , after which I went to Serjeant 's Inn Coffee-House , where I stay 'd from six 'till eight in the Evening , and went from thence , to the King 's Head Tavern in Holborn , where I stay 'd till twelve at Night - But before I call Evidence to prove where I was that Night , I would settle one Point . It has been sworn , that Mac Cray rid towards Fulham : Now I would once more ask the Doctor , whether when Mac Cray robb 'd the Coach , he rode directly that Way or towards London . Dr. Lancaster . He did not ride towards London , but he rid the other Way . Wreathock . I thank you Doctor ! This is a full Contradiction to Brown , who swore that when Mac Cray left the Coach , he rid directly towards London . Thomas Bullock , of Clement 's Inn . On the eleventh of June in Trinity Term , I delivered a Copy of a Notice to Mr. Ray , Mr. Wreathock 's Clerk . William Ray . The Notice was delivered to me at Serjeant 's Inn Coffee-House , between six and seven in the Evening . Mr , Wreathock coming in , I gave him this Notice , for executing a Writ of Enquiry - He was then concern 'd in a Cause , between Lun and Ormond . He staid there 'till near eight , and then went out with Mr. Brookshank , and I saw him no more that Night - the Cause was try 'd on the sixteenth of June ; but the Entry was made in the Marshall 's Book the eleventh of June . I have lived Clerk with Mr. Wreathock twelve Years , he had full Business for three Clerks , by which he has got much Money , and is now worth two or three hundred Pounds a Year - He bears a very good Character . John Totteridge . I live In Westminster , and have worked as a Carpenter to Mr. Wreathock , four Years . He told me he had a Mortgage on an Estate , in Little-Britain : The Houses not being finish 'd , he asked me what it would cost him to finish them , and I computed it at two thousand Pounds : He said his was a second Mortgage , and he wanted some Goods upon the Premises to be remov 'd , he desired me to do it on the eleventh of June , because that being a Holyday , the first Mortgagee could not then prevent it . Accordingly I got Assistance , and on the eleventh of June we moved the Goods from Little-Britain , to the Windmill Ale-House by Hicks 's Hall . When this was done , we went to inform him of it : We found him at Mr. Lincolns the King 's Head in Middle-Row Holborn . It was five or ten Minutes past eight when we came there , I supp 'd with him upon Calves Liver and Bacon fryed , and staid 'till twelve at Night , and he was never our of my Company but once , when he stept into another Room to speak with a Gentleman - I am certain it was the eleventh of June , both by my Father 's Books , and my own . Abraham Brookshank . I have known Mr. Wreathock sixteen Years , and did Business for him . I made the second Mortgage ; and afterwards waiting upon the first Mortgagee ; I thought by his Discourse , we had Reason to fear a Writ of Execution , upon which I advised Wreathock , to move the Goods ; which he concluded to do , on the eleventh of June , because an Ejectment could not be taken out that Day , it being a Holyday . In the Evening I was with him at Serjeant 's Inn Coffee-House , At near eight of the Clock , we went from thence , to the King 's Head Tavern : Between eight and nine , Totteridge and Whitman came in , and said , they had moved the Goods ; we said 'till twelve , and then Totteridge and I went out at the Back-door .

Mr. Herbert , Constable . These Goods I found at Mr. Smith 's in Theobalds-Court Red-lion-Square . This parcel at Mr Bingham 's in Drury-Lane . This at Mrs. Spericks in Bloomsbury-Market , an this at Mr. Medley 's in Compton-Street St. Anns . Mrs . Freer . I am Executrix to my Sister and as her Executrix this Coral and these Goods are mine . Q . Were they never in your Possession . Mrs . Freer . No . Q . How long before her Death had you seen the Goods in her possession . Mrs . Freer . Not for several Years . Elizabeth Freer . I have often seen this Coral in my Mamma 's Scrutore I saw it there just before her Death - This enameld Ring was my Mamma 's . It was lost from her House seven or eight Months before she dyed . As for this other Ring , I ca n't say it was mine or my Mamma 's because we had several such , I know nothing of the Buckles or the Canister-tops . Q . Was not the Prisoner often entrusted with Madam Freer 's things ? Mrs . Freer . Yes , my sister and all of us had a very good Opinion of the Prisoner till the Goods were mist - When Sir Wolstan was going into the Country , the Prisoner came to settle Accompts with me , there being five years Wages due to her at my sister 's Death - I desired her to deliver me up every thing that belong 'd to my sister . She gave me a Box , a Gold Ring , and three pieces of Callicoe , I asked her if she had any thing else of my sisters , and she said no . Council . Did she say nothing about putting things up in a hurry ? Mrs Freer . No - When the Goods were found in her Custody , she said , that I bid her take every thing that was in the Drawers , and so she took those things among the Rest . I told her indeed she might take all her Lady 's ( my sister 's ) Linnen and when she brought the Gowns and Petticoats to me , I took what I thought fit , and gave her the remainder . Council . At whose desire did you engage in this Prosecution ? Mrs . Freer . My own . Council . Did you never declare that you did it at Sir Wolstan 's desire . Mrs . Freer . No . Mary Smith . After the Prisoner left Sir Wolstan 's Service she came to my House and told me Mrs . Freer , had taken 2 suits of Cloaths , a Black Velvet , and a White Damask from her , but she was even with her another way , for she had got a Gold Coral and a Gold Spoon . This was three Months ago , and about one Month ago she went into Essex . and left three Boxes at my House , In one of them this Coral and this Mourning Ring , was found . Prisoner . I lived twelve Years with my Old Lady Madam Freer . I kept all the Keys , and was entrusted with every thing that was of Value in the House . After my Old Lady dyed , my Young Lady Married to Sir Wolstan Dixie . In a little time we left of House-keeping in Town , and the Goods were all pack 'd up in great haste , to go to Sir Wolstan 's Country-Seat in Leicester shire . And its very likely that I might , when we were in such a hurry and Confusion , put some of my old Lady 's things among my own . The Night before we went away , I would have settled with Madam Freer ( my old Lady 's Sister and Executrix ) but she said she had not leisure then , and she would settle with me when the Family came to Town again - Sir Wolstan turn 'd me away suddenly , and I return 'd to London in August last , but Mrs . Freer has never yet called in to settle the Account , and the Five Year Wages and other Money is yet due to mes . Mrs . Freer . Tis true the Account is not-yet settled and I believe there is five Years Wages due to her Mr. Herbet , Constable . I went down into Essex to take the Prisoner and when she was told that Sir Wolstan had sent Baron Thompson 's Warrant , she said Sir Wolstan need not have given himself that trouble , for if he had but sent her a Letter she would have come to him and let him have look 'd over all her Boxes . Upon this , I took no Charge of her , but came away and left her to come as she thought fit , she took Horse and came to Town with a Friend of hers , without being in any Custody . Mrs. Bainton . I knew her twelve Yeard when she lived with Old Madam Freer , anr , she always behaved in the best Manner and so much to her Mistress 's satisfactiod that she left her a Legacy of Ten Pound Madam Freer dyed the 13th of March anron the first of May her Daughter was married to Sir Wolstan Dixy and they went directly to Lewisham . Sir Wolstan and his Lady came to Town again on Friday the rest of the Familiy came on Saturday . And on Sunday the Goods were pack 'd up in a great hurry and Confusion , in order to set out the next Morning for Bosworth in Leicester-shire . The Room was strewed all over with Goods , and the Prisoner was putting them up in Trunks and Boxes , she said she scarce knew where to put things , and believed that by mistake she had put up some of her Lady 's Goods with her own . Mrs. Collins . I have known her eleven or twelve Years , she was House-keeper and Head-servant , and had the best of Characters from the Family . When I heard she was in Newgate , I was amazed , and should as soon have thought of hearing the King was there - I live at the Colour Shop . in King 's Gate Street . Cornelius Maddox , Porter . I assisted her in cording up the Boxes , and Trunks . I said , Here is a great many Things , what must I do with them . Aye , says she , Here is a great many things of my Ladies , as well as mine , I think I will send them to Lewisham . But Mrs. Bingham , and Mrs. Smith , told her she might leave them at their Houses , and accordingly , the Boxes were carried to their Houses publickly . Mrs. Wright , The Day Sir Wolstan went out of Town , the Prisoner said to Mrs . Freer , Mam , there is a great many things put up , but if in this hurry there should be any thing of my Lady 's intermixt with mine , here are my Boxes , we shall not stay for ever in the Country , and when we return we will put all to rights . Mr. Nelson , Jeweller in Bow-lane . I am related to Madam Freer - Since the Prisoner was discharged from Sir Wolstan 's service , and before she was taken up , she called at my House , and said , she was going into Essex to see her Friends ; that Mrs . Freer owed her forty Pound , and my Lady Dixy owed her one hundred Pound ; that she believed in the hurry she had packed up some things belonging to the Family among her own , but when they came to Town she would settle with them , and look out what was theirs , and return them . Sir Wolstan 's Family was then in Leicestershire , and Mrs . Freer was at Lewisham - The Prisoner had the Character of a very honest . faithful Servant , she was intrusted with the Jewels . Mr. Smith , again . I was by when she was packing up the Goods in a great hurry : she asked me if she might send some of them to my House . I told her , yes , and welcome . No Body came to enquire after her , till Sir Wolstan came with a Constable . Mr. Betts . I had her from her Friends , when she came about fourteen Years old , she lived with me two Years , and went from me to Madam Freer . I never heard a Word a-miss of her before , for she had an unspotted Character , and I always valued her for it . Mr. Witham . I knew her before she lived at Mrs. Freers , she always bore a very good Character , without the least Aspersion . Mrs. Preir . I have known her ten Years , she had a very honest good Character - I visited her Lady , who had a very good Opinion of her . The Jury acquitted her . Second Indictment . - Herbert , Constable . These two Diamond Rings were found at Mrs. Smedley 's ; this Gold Locket and Gold Hook at Mrs. Smiths . Mrs . Freer . Both these Diamond Rings were Lady Dixy 's , but I do not know the Locket . Miss Freer . This Ring was lost a Year ago by Lady Dixy . The Prisoner said she had lost two Moidores , and her own Ring , and this , and that she believed one Mark Sayer , had taken them ; but this Ring was found in her Box - This Gold Hook was Lady Dixy 's , and this Locket is hers , it was given her by Sir Wolstan , and she said she would never part with it . Herbert . Here is a parcel of China-saucers , three Cups , three Sance-bowls , and one Punch-bowl - but several of them are broke . Sir Wolstan Dixy . This Locket was my Mother 's , I believe there 's my Grand-mother 's Hair in it . I gave this to my Wife , with a Picture of one of my Ancestors ( set in Gold ) who was Father to the Lord-Mayor of London in 1585 . I gave it to her in Leicestershire in July last , and have never seen it since : she said she would never give it away - I lost eleven Shirts , and fourteen pair of Stockings . This China was found at Smith 's , all but one sauce Bowl , and that was at Smedley 's ; the last time I saw it , was at Bosworth Park . That Punch Bowl had a Cover , and cost me three pound ; it was crack 'd , but not broke when I had it last . This Blue Winesauce Bowl was whole in August . My Wife had a Respect for the Prisoner at first , but soon grew sick of her , for she used to sit up till two or three in the Morning , for which , and other Reasons , I was resolved to part with her : she was seven Days or more in packing up her Things : she endeavoured to keep out of my sight , but I met with her on Sunday , and told her she should go the next Morning : so she sent away six Boxes , and Trunks of Goods to the Waggon before I was up - Herbert . Here is ten Yards of silk and stuff Lacing , twenty five pair of Gloves , one pair trim 'd with Gold , and one pair trim 'd with Silver , part of these were found at Smedley 's . Sir Wolstan . This Lacing is the Remainder of what went round my White Damask Curtains in Leicestershire - The Gloves I can not swear to , but I have paid twenty pounds for Gloves since I was married . Mr. West , a Glover . I know one pair of these Gloves , but I can not tell whom I sold them to . Council . Two Yards of printed Callico . Sir Wolstan . This I had in the Country before I was married . Council . Two Red-silk Aprons . Sir Wolstan . I do not know them . Council . A piece of Yellow Damask . Mrs. Smith , Mantua-maker . This Damask is part of a Gown I made for Lady Dixy a Year ago . Juryman . How can you swear to that ? Did you compare the Figure and Selvedge - I would not swear to a piece of Silk that was in my shop a Year ago . Smith . I heard her say she had a Yellow Gown of her Lady 's , which Sir Wolstan bid her leave , but that she took part of it , and hoped her Lady would send her the rest . Sir Wolstan . She had taken the Yellow Gown to pieces . Miss Freer . She had the Gown of Lady Dixy to pack up , but Lady Dixy asked for it again , and bid her leave it all ; But the Prisoner said she would have part of it . - It was Lady Dixy 's Night Gown at Bosworth . The Prisoner had it , and my Lady bid her leave it ; and she said she would leave it ; but then she said she would have half of it back ; so that it should do no body any good . Juryman . It seems then it was given her , and she said publickly before the Family , that she would keep part of it . Council . A piece of pink Damask , three silver Girdles , thirteen silk Girdles , one pair of blue silk Damask Shoes , with silver Lace . Miss Freer . I believe these are Lady Dixy 's Shoes , but I am not sure . Council . Eight Cambrick Handkerchiefs , two Fans . Miss Freer . These are Lady Dixy 's Fans , she had them at Bosworth - She had a great Number of Fans . Council . One Scarlet silk Night Gown . Mrs. Smith . I believe I made this for my Lady ; I have made her three , four , or five such in a Winter . Prisoner . Would not you have bought that Gown of me when I was going into Mourning for my old Lady ? Smith . She offered to sell me a scarlet Gown before they went into mourning , which was about eight Months ago ; and she said , her Lady gave it her - This may be the same for ought I know . Council . One Yellow silk Gown and Petticoat . Smith . I made such a Coat and Gown for my Lady . Q . How many new Gowns might you make the Lady in a Year ? Smith . A great many - I believe a Dozen in a Year . Q . And what could she do with so many , if she did not give some of them to her Maids ? Smith . The Lady used to give the Prisoner a great many Clothes , and she never denied or concealed them , but wore them in publick - She told me when her Lady married , she had given her all her Clothes . Q . Is it not usual for single Ladies of great Fortunes to give away their Maiden Clothes when they marry ? Smith . Yes , it is usual - And all these Clothes in Court were made before my Lady married , for when she married she was in Mourning . Madam Freer . My Niece had a good Fortune , and Sir Wolstan has a large Estate . Council . Here is a parcel of new Linnen . Sir . Wolstan . I doubt that Linnen was taken from me , for I had a great Bill to pay Mrs. Bingham for Linnen - I have had above one thousand Pound to pay since I have been married for things that I knew nothing of - It is very corroborating that the Prisoner should have fourteen or fifteen large Trunks , Boxes , and Scrutores filled with Goods . Juryman . You said , she sent but six Boxes from your House . Sir Wolstan . Yes ; but in searching , we found eight more , though as I found nothing in them that I knew to be mine , I did not charge her with them . Council . Have you not declared you would have her hanged before Christmass , if it cost you one thousand Pounds . Sir Wolstan . No - I was told it would be an expensive Prosecution ; and I said , I would have Justice done me , if it cost me one thousand Pounds . Council . You say your Lady was sick of the Prisoner , How comes it that she does not appear in this Prosecution ? Sir Wolstan . She is at my Country Seat in Leicestershire - She is with Child , and in her Condition , and the badness of the Roads , it might endanger her Life to come up . Council . Have you not said that you had prevented her coming to Town ? Sir Wolstan . No . Council . Have you not commanded that your Coach should not go above four Miles from home ? Sir Wolstan . I am not to answer all Questions . Council . Have you no Papers , or Notes due to the Prisoner ? Sir Wolstan . No . Council . Did you seize none when you seized the Goods ? Sir Wolstan . I had some - The Constable found two . I think one was at Smith 's , and the other at Smedley 's ; but he told the People at whose Houses he found them , that he had such Notes . Q . What became of them ? Sir Wolstan . I have them not - They might be left in the Boxes where they were found . Council . Had you no Letters ? Sir Wolstan . Yes ; I found some of my Wife 's and some of my own , and a Letter to one of my Footmen . Q . Where are they ? Sir Wolstan . I have them not here . Q . Why did you take Letters that did not belong to you ? Sir Wolstan . Some of them are my own . - Produce the Letters . Sir Wolstan . They are of no consequence . The Papers were chiefly Bills upon me - Shoemakers , Drapers , and other Bills of Parcels for Goods . Prisoner . Did not you say to me at the Tavern the Night I was committed , that if I did not tell you what past between Capt . - and - you would send me to Newgate . Sir Wolstan . She writing to my Wife since I came away , mentioned the Names of Capt . - , and a Baronet ; and told my Wife it was unfortunate she married so soon , for she might have had such , or such a Gentleman . Council . Officer , Call Lady Dixy - We have subpoena 'd her , and will prove that she was willing to come . Then Lady Dixy was called , but did not appear . Thomas Weaver . This Subpoena I served Lady Dixy at Market Bosworth , on Day last . I told her I came from Mr. Nelson , who desired she would come to Town to clear her Servant . She said , she was never more surprized ; that she believed the Maid was very innocent ; and that she would come with all her heart , but that Sir Wolstan had sent her down a Letter , and threatned it should cost her her Life if she came - she said she had been served with one Subpoena before by Mr. Street - I set out on Saturday Night last at half an Hour past eight . I took post at Littleworth , and rid a-cross the Country with the Post-boy . Robert Nelson . The Prisoner sent for me to Newgate , and I knowing how she had been trusted , and what Character she bore , I took Horse this [ Satur ] day was a Fort-night , and arrived at Bosworth on Sunday . I told Lady Dixy , that Sir Wolstan had sent her Maid to Newgate . She said I am surprised that Sir Wolstan should offer such a thing , I believe she is as innocent as the Child unborn . He must know that she had a great many things of mine which I gave her . I told her among other Things , that she was charged with stealing a Locket and some China . She answered I gave her the China , and as for the Locket it was but a paultry Thing , that Sir Wolstan gave me , and I bid her lay it by among her other odd Things till I came to Town , and then I would settle with her , for I owe her a hundred Pound , I told her , when I came to London I would send her a Subpoena . She cryed , and said she would come with all her Heart , and would pack up her Things to be ready against next Friday - After the Prisoner came from Bosworth , but before she went into Essex , and before there was any Warrant against her she dined at my House , and told me , she had got a Locket of Lady Dixy 's , that the Lady owed her a hundred Pound , and when the Lady came to Town they should settle , and the Locket should be returned . And she said too that Mrs . Freer owed her ten Pound for a Legacy and thirty Pound for Wages . Mr. Richards . When Sir Wolstan took out a Warrant against the Prisoner , we spent that Evening at the Tavern . I told him it was natural to believe that his Lady gave her the Cloaths , and therefore it would be proper to send for her up . No D - me if I do , says he , for then she 'll be acquitted . Mr. Burdock was with me and heard the same - I remember in particular the Locket and Rings were then mentioned . Mrs Yates . My Husband is a Silk-Dyer , we live in King-Street Bloomsbury - Last Saturday was seven-night Sir Wolstan came to my House , and said he had a Warrant to search for Betty Barker 's Things , and seeing some Silks in the Shop , he said , These are some of my Lady 's Silks I suppose No says I , you should consider this is a Silk Dyers shop . Then he said Betty Barker had robb 'd him of several hundred Pounds , and he had got her in Newgate and she should be hang 'd . And yet at that very time , she was not taken , but was with her Friends in Essex . I told him I was sorry to hear him charge her with any such thing , when I knew she had behaved so well to good Mam Freer - I have known her seven Years and she was a very honest Industrious young Woman . Mrs. Colly . Sir Wolstan came one day to our House , and went up stairs and talk 'd with my Sisters - My Sisters came out with him , and one of them said , Indeed it was none of I that said so He answer 'd , Then it was your Sister . But she denyed it too , and then he turned to me and said , Then you say that she will return all the Things , and confess the Felony - No , God forbid ! says I , for I believe she is as good and as honest a Servant as any in England . - He said if Mrs . Freer would not indict her she would not be hanged . Mrs. Bainton . Sir Wolstan came to my House two Days after she was committed , and said , she had stoln a thousand Pound and was gone to Newgate . I was so surprised that I was ready to fall into fits . He told me and spoke it with great passion and violence , that he would hang her , let it cost what it would . Next Week he came again and said , I see you have all forsaken me , you all go to Newgate . I told him no , I had not been there , I hear says he , that my Wife is coming up , but if she does , she comes none to me , for I 'll throw her off , and she shall never live with me again . I have ordered my Servants not to carry her in the Coach above three or four Miles from Home . Mrs. Betts . I have known the Prisoner fourteen Years , she lived with me two Years and always had an excellent Character . Mrs. Rogerson .

I think my Aunt was by when he said it . Mrs . Freer . I do n't remember it . Mr. Nelson . I never made such a Declaration . Mrs. Smith . I have heard him say in a ratling merry way , that he would say any thing to serve a Friend . Mr. Hubert .

When he left Sr. Wolstan 's , he came to my House in Covent-Garden , and had two old Shirts , and a Bob-wig , which he said Sir Wolstan gave him ; they were very old Shirts , and not fit for Sir Wolstan to wear . Prisoner . I lived with Sir Wolstan from May the first , to June the twenty second . And when I went into his service , I agreed to have his old Cloaths . One day as I was puting on his Shirt , he asked me why I gave him a torn Shirt , Sir , says I , they are all so bad the Maids ca n't mend them . Well , says he , I have got some new Cloth , and I 'll have Caps made of the best of these , and do you see that the Maids do not make Aprons af the rest . I told him I would take care of that for my own sake ; but Sir , says I. you have got several old mouldy Wigs , what shall I do with them ? He bid me take 'em , and do what I would with them . Sir Wolstan . I never said so . - Kynaston , Esq ; Five Years ago the Prisoner left my Fathers Service , and had a very honest Character . Mr. Moore .

He was a second time indicted on the Coroners Inquisition for Manslaughter . Henry Passer . I was at the White Horse Ale house in Castle-Alley , on the twenty seventh of November , between five and six in the Afternoon . Philip Harris , a Porter , was in Liquor , and the Prisoner was playing the Rogue with him . The Deceased came in , and sat down in a Box . He was in Liquor too , and very much , but not so drunk as a beast , for he did not reel about the House . Harris had lent his Coat to the Prisoner , who went out and whited it , and coming in again he tost the Coat about till it fell upon the Deceased , and whited him He got up in a Passion , and went to the Prisoner 's Brother and Sister ( who kept the House , and were then at Dinner ) and complained that he had been abused by their Black-guard Brother . Mrs. Gardner desired him to be easy ; but he kicked the Grid-iron about , and threw the Candle and Candle-stick against the Grates . Upon this , the Prisoner struck him first , and gave him three Blows on the Face ; I think it was with his open Hand . At the first Blow , the Deceased stood about half a Minute , and then fell back with the Nape of his Neck against the Bench . I took him up , his Eyes were fixt . An Apothecary 's Apprentice being in the Room , let him blood , and then he spoke , and was something better , and I went away . He lived about twenty two Hours . He and the Prisoner were intimate Acquaintance , and had been at Breakfast together but two Mornings before . Prisoner . Was the Fall occasioned by the Blow , by his being in drink ? H. Passer . I can not say , which . He said himself when he came in , that he had been drinking Punch , and was full of Liquor , Prisoner Did he offer to sit down when he fell ? H. Passer . I do not know . Thomas Critchet . I am Servant to Mr. Gardner , the Prisoner 's Brother . Phillip Harris , a Watchman had been fuddled all Day . The Deceased came in much in Liquor . Harris 's Coat was whited , and thrown upon him , and he flirted it off upon the Deceased , who I believe was a sleep . He got up , and thinking the Deceased had done it , he went to my Master and Mistress in the Bar-room , and said , D - me , must I be abused by your Blackguard brother ? Then returning to his Seat , he took a Candle-wick , threw it violently against the Grates , and said , D - your Black guard House ; and brustling up to the Prisoner , called him Names and abused him , and I think held up his Fist at him . The Prisoner struck him three times on the side of his Face pretty quick ; but whether with his Hand open , or not , I can not say . The Deceased spoke not a Word more , but stood half a Minute , and whether he was going to sit down , and thought the Bench just behind him , or was stunned with the Blow , or the Liquor was the Cause of it , I do not know ; but he fell down backwards . The Prisoner is as good natured a Man as lives , and I believe there was no Enmity between them . Nathaniel Manton . While the Coat was gone out to be whited , to make Sport with Harris , the Deceased came in , I asked him to spend a Penny in Brown Two-penny . No Boy , says he , I have been drinking Punch all Day ; he leaned his Head upon the Bench , and seemed to be sick with drinking , when the Prisoner came in with Harris 's whited Coat on , and frisked about , and then pulled it off , and shook it upon Harris , and Harris put it on the Deceased , and whited him with it . The Deceased got up in a Passion , and curst , and swore , and called him Names , and kicked the Gridiron about , and threw the Candle-stick against the Grates . I do not know whether he threw it at the Prisoner , or not . The Prisoner said , who do you abuse , and struck him three Blows . He stept back , and fell with the side of his Head on the Bench . I blooded him , and then he was a little better . He died about six in the Evening . I believe the Fall was the Cause of his Death , and not the Blows the Prisoner gave him . Prisoner . Did he fall by the Blows , or the Liquor ? N. Manton . If he had fallen by the Blows , he would have fallen immediately , but he stept back , and made a little pause . Prisoner , Did not Harrison tell him that it was he and not me that threw the Coat upon him ? N. Manton . Yes . Daniel Woodham , Surgeon . On Denuding the Skull , on the back part of the Head , I found much extravasated Blood between the Skull and the Skin . I took off the Top of the Skull , and found the Brain tumified . I found no Bruise on his Temples , and I believe the Blow he received by the Fall was the Cause of his Death . Capt . Picksat and Mr. Lawrence , deposed that the Prisoner was a peaceable quiet Man . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 75 . Murder of Philip Williams , was indicted for the Martha his Wife , was indicted for the Martha his Wife , by kicking and beating her , and throwing a Tin Kettle at her , and thereby giving her several mortal Bruises , and one mortal Wound on the left Side of her Head , of the length of one Inch , and depth of a quarter of an Inch , November 18 , of which mortal Wound and Bruises the languished till the ninth of December following , and then died . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for Manslaughter . Mary Wilson . The Prisoner , and his Wife and I , were all acquainted , she kept a Milk Cellar in Queen-street , and he is a Soldier in the First Regiment of Guards , and a very honest Man he is , and his Wife had been ailing a long time , and was dropsical , and he did not strike her at all . But as I was a going to say , I went to see his Wife at this Milk Cellar , and we sat down to eat , and by and by in comes the Prisoner . Pat , says he , It is a strange thing that I can never come home but my Neighbours find fault with you for scolding and quarrelling , and with that , she took him by the Shoulder , and threw him against the Wainscot , for which he gave her a slight Kick on the Tail of her things , and she took him by the Hair of his Head , and threw herself on the Bed , and dragged him to her , and gave him several Blows on the Face , and scratched him till the Blood came . I did what I could to part them , and then he went towards the Chimney to take his Hat , and she flung the Cow at him , and struck him on the left Side as he could scarce recover his Breath . Q What Cow ? Mary Wilson A Sign-board of the Cow , that stood next the Street - And so in his Passion , the first thing he took up was a Tin Milk Kettle , he threw it at her , and hit her on the left side of the Head , and it bled very much , at which he seemed to be frighted , and ran to fetch a Surgeon - Next Morning she went to milk her Cow , and I found her with the Kettle upon her Head . I wonder Mrs. Williams , says I , that you will carry the Kettle upon your Head when you know it is out of order - O , says she , It is not my Head that I stand upon , but it is my side , for I got a drop in my Eye , and fell over the Churn and hurt my side - At one o'Clock next Morning she was got so drunk at a milk Celler in the Strand , that she had much ado to get home ; and when she was dead there was nothing but a bit of Oyl-skin on the Wound . Mary Prat . I heard say , that the Prisoner had killed his Wife , and so I went to see how it was , and meeting a Man coming up the Stairs , I asked him if she was dead ; he said , No , she stirs ; and the Prisoner said he was sorry for it . Richard Hales , Surgeon . On the twenty or twenty first of last Month , the Deceased came to my House in Pall-mall , and complained of a Wound in her Head - I found the Skull bare about an Inch long , a little above her left Temple , but no Fracture , nor Fissure . I drest it eight or nine times . She complained of a pain in her side . I let her blood , and gave her a Plaister for it , and she came no more . When dead , I took off the Top of the Scull , and all was right in respect to the external Wound . Taking off the Dura Mater ( a strong Membrane that every where nes the internal Part of the Scull , and covers the Brain . ) I found in the Top of the left Lobe of the Brain , two small Ulcers , from whence a small Quantity of Matter was discharged - These Ulcers might be the Cause of her Death ; but I can not say that the Blow was the Cause of the Ulcers ; but I rather think they might proceed from some Obstruction in the small Capillary Blood Vessels of the Brain , which might be occasioned by an ill Habit of Body . On opening the Breast , I found a small Adhesion of the Lungs to the Pleura , and a pretty large Quantity of Matter on that side of the Breast : This with the Matter in the Brain , might be a concurring Cause of her Death : And I can hardly think that the Wound was partly the Cause - I found nothing else particular in the Breast , or any other of the Cavities . John Goodwin . The Ulcers in the Lobe of the Brain might proceed either from a Concussion of the Brain , or an ill Habit of Body ; and the Matter in the left Cavity of the Breast might proceed from the same ill Habit . Prisoner . My Wife and I lived very happily till I was lame and could work no longer ; and then she used to get drunk , and lye out a Nights , and when she came home , would cry out Murder ; and so I lay in the Barracks - She wanted Money to pay her Cow man ; I told her , My Dear , I have spent three Half pence out of the two Shillings ; and then she fell upon me , upon which , I told her I would have no more of this Milk Trade , and so I took the Pail , and threw it up Stairs , not with any Design to hurt her ; but it unluckily hit against the Corner of the Stairs , and so struck her on the Head . The Jury acquitted him . 76. Mary Ashby , alias Ashly , was indicted for stealing a Brocaded Silk Gown value eight Pound , the Goods of Nathaniel Smith , in the House of John King , October the 10th . Ann Cosins . The Gown was sent me to alter , I have Lodgings in John King 's House , I went out on Friday and when I returned I heard the Gown was lost . I enquired who had been there and was told only a Woman , who went up stairs to one that lodged above - I went to several Pawnbrokers , and among the rest to Mr. Heatons and shewed a pattern of it to his Servant , who said he could not or would not ( I forget which ) tell me any thing about it . I advertised it with two Guineas Reward , and then Heaton came and gave me notice , that he had got the Gown , which he said was pawn 'd for forty Shillings , but he expected two Guineas Reward . Next Day the Prisoner came to justify herself to me . I sent for Heaton and asked him if she was the Woman that pawn 'd it . He said No , and then she fell upon me and abused me , and he seemed to be concerned for her . I afterwards got an Attorney to write him a Letter , that if he would not produce the Person that brought him the Gown , he should be Prosecuted , and then he said it was the Prisoner . When she was taken she offered to pay me a Crown a Week till the two Guineas were paid , if I would make it up . Amos Heaton or Hayton . She brought the Gown on the 10th of October , and pledged it for Thirty Shillings and redeemed her own Gown with part of the Money . When I came home I saw the Brocaded Gown on my Counter , She came again next Day , and I sent her Ten Shillings more upon it . Mrs. Cosins sent for me in the Evening , and I had taken so little notice of the Woman in the Morning , that I could not be positive to her But afterwards when she was brought to our House , she own 'd herself to be the Person that took the Gown , and then I sent for Mrs. Cosins , Guilty 39 s.

Edward Jones , was indicted for Ravishing Sarah Evans , May the First . Sarah Evans . The Prisoner keeps a Pawn-broker 's Shop in George street , Spittle-Fields . He was my Father 's particular Acquaintance , and I going to School hard by , I used to go to his House in a Morning , and leave my Victuals there , and come back there to Dinner , and so go home at Night . I went there first in March , and one Morning about eight a Clock the latter end of April , as I was in the Prisoner 's Shop , and no body at home but he and I , he shut the Street-door , and as I sat in an Elbow Leather-Chair , he first meddled with me with his Fingers , and I fell upon the Ground . He then took me up in his Arms , and set me in the Chair again , and then put my legs over his , and - into - half an Hour - Yes . Q Did you make an Resistance ? Sarah Evans . No - I do n't know what Resistance is . Q Did you struggle , or cry out ? Sarah Evans . Yes , I struggled as much as I could , and cry 'd out as loud as I could all the while , but no Soul could hear me ; for the Shop is in a narrow Street , and the backside of the House is a great Vacancy , tho ' People go along the Street ; but the Door was lock 'd and the Window next the Street was filled up with Goods . Then he shewed me a naked Sword , and said he would kill me if I told any Body what he had done to me ; and so I went to School and said Nothing . In two or three Weeks afterwards , I began to break out , and he told my Father it was the Itch ; and so the Prisoner took me in Hand , and gave me Physick for six Weeks ; and then it proved to be the Foul Disease , and I was forced to go into the Hospital . I never told any Body how the Prisoner had used me , till eight Weeks after he did it , and then I told my Mother - I was fifteen Years old last May - No Man ever medled with me but the Prisoner , and he never did but that once . Edward Evans . When my Daughter had discovered this , I asked the Prisoner how he could serve her so ? He said , if he did do it , he could have done it at other times if he would , and he bid me get out of his House , and said if I gave him an ill Word he would trounce me . When the Girl first broke out ( about Whitsuntide ) he said it was the Itch , and undertook to Cure her , for he pretended to be a sort of a Surgeon , but it proved to be the Foul Disease , and so I got her into the Hospital . Jane Blackman . I live near the Prisoner . The Girl was in Health and had no Blemish when she went to him . Judith Sykes . The Prisoner 's shop is in such a Thoroughfare that if she cryed out , the People in the street must needs have heard her . She had been my Apprentice two Years , and went away about three quarters of a Year ago , she behaved but very indifferently , for she was a very bold Girl , a great Liar , and a Pilferer . She sometimes used to stay out late at Night , and has seem 'd to be in Liquor , and hardly able to stand when she came home , and her Clothes have been very Dirty as if she had fell down in the Street . Her Father used to tell me next Day she had been at his House , and therefore desired me to excuse her . Samuel Jones , the Prisoner 's half-Brother . Long before any thing of this , her Father complained to me , that Mr. Sikes her Master had attempted to ravish her . I sent for Mr. Sikes , and when the Girl saw him she run away . Her Father desired she might be discharged from her service , for fear she should be ruined , and he perswaded me to go with him and the Girl before a Justice , to get a Warrant against her Master for an intent to Ravish . And the Girl there said that he used her rudely with his Fingers , but that she did not offer to cry out . I have heard she is a loose Girl , and kept Company with a Barber that was Pox 'd . Sarah Olney . ( the Prisoner 's Daughter . ) The Girl has a very base Character , rather lewd than otherwise , and her Parents were always litigious People . When her Father first brought her to my Father it was to complain that Mr. Sykes had been rude with her , and had lain with her upon the Hearth - I lay in my Father 's House in all April last , and the House was always open by six in the Morning , tho ' its possible the Door might be shut by chance , and if she cryed out but half as loud as I speak now . she might have been heard on both sides of the House by the Passengers that were constantly going by . My Father is hard of Hearing , and therefore . I or my Mother were obliged to be in the way to attend the Customers - My Father and I have both charg 'd her before her Father 's Face , with having the Pox , but she always deny 'd it . Her Mother had a sort of a Leprosy , and the Girl her self was a little broke out before she came from Mr. Sykes 's , for Mr. Sikes had 'nointed her , and given her Flower of Brimstone , and made her wear a Smock two Weeks on that Account , and her Father desired my Father to give her Physick . She used to go from our House to her Writing Master , at Six in the Afternoon , and her Father has often come with a Candle and a Lanthorn at eleven and twelve at Night , or one in the Morning , to enquire for her - After I had told him I believed she had the Pox , he came the next Day , and said he had searched her himself , and was sure she had never known Man . Ann Scott . I have known her Father come several times to look for her at Midnight - she had a loose Character , and would keep Company with any Man , tho ' she did not know him , if he did but say , Come Sal go with me . Margaret Atkins . I live so near the Prisoner that if she had cryed out I should have heard , and so would the People that past the Street . The Prisoner has the Character of a very sober modest Man . Mrs. Cockin . After the Rape was sworn , I ask 'd her if he had entered her Body . She said no . I asked her if he was a Man , or a Woman , and she said she could not tell . I had sent her Mother for a Pot of Beer , but she stood upon the stairs to listen ; and hearing me ask these Questions , she came in and said , she was betrayed , and flung me down seven stairs . John Yallop . I heard one ask the Girl who gave her the Pox , and she said she could not tell . Mary Proctor . The Girl had a breaking out , last Christmass . I asked what it was , and her Father said , he believed it was the Leprosy , for her Mother broke out so when she was with Child . In September he told me the Prisoner had ravished his Daughter ; and if the Prisoner would give him one hundred Pounds he would make it up . I told the Prisoner this , and he refused - Her Father told me that his Wife was a base Woman , and had advised the Girl to swear this Rape , and was the Occasion of all the false Swearing about it - I have heard that she is a wicked vile base lying Girl , that she used to lye out till twelve or one in the Morning , and that a Barber gave her the Pox . Several gave the Prisoner the Character of a sober modest honest Man , and not inclinable to Women . Lydia Hyley . The Girl has the Character of a very harmless honest sober Girl , and I never heard that she loved Company . The Truth is , she is not over burthened with Sense , but was always more for playing with Children , and Baby 's , than keeping Company with Men . Several other of the Girl 's Neighbours deposed , that her general Character was that of a very sober modest Child , and her Father a very honest Man , and that they could have brought the whole Street to have said the same , if there had been occasion for it . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 85. Elizabeth Smith , was indicted for stealing two Candlesticks , & c. the Goods of John Barns , November 7 . Guilty 1 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 86.

On Sunday last , I went to visit a Friend at Kensington , and returning homeward about one in the Morning , I turned the Corner of Maxwell street , and went down Gerrards-street towards Princes-street . And going into Princes-street , two Men came up . One of them said , D - him ! I have him , and attempted to take hold of me , but mist his Aim : The other , which was the Prisoner , said , D - him ! Murder him ! I ran , and cryed out Thieves ! Murder ! The Watch in Princes street came up , I told them I had like to have been robbed . They pursued , and took the Prisoner by St. Ann 's Church - Sir , says he , I am the Son of a Gentleman , Mr. Horn , an Attorney in King-street , and I am his Clerk - Neither of the two Men bid me stand , nor did they demand my Money . I did not see that the Prisoner had any Arms , but the other ( who escaped ) had a Scimiter , or Hanger . William Hubbard , Watchman . Standing at the Corner of Dean-street going into Compton-street , I heard a Noise , and the Prisoner , and another Man came apace to the Corner . I seized the Prisoner , but the other started away . Then the other Watch , and the Gentleman came up . Thomas Cole , Watchman . I stood at the Corner of Maxwell-street , where the Prosecuter come by , and bid me good Morrow . Then he turned down Gerrard-street , and went towards Princes street . I presently heard an Out-cry of Murder , and Thieves , and I went out directly , and met no body in Gerrard-street , and coming to Hubbard , I heard him say to the Prisoner , You are one of them . So we took the Prisoner to the Watch-house . Richard Pye . I am Watch-man of St. James 's Parish . I heard an Out-cry of Murder , and Thieves , and saw two Men running towards King Street , St. Ann 's . They out-ran me , but when I came to the End of Compton-street , Hubbard had got hold of one of them , and he was carried to the Watch-house - Mr. Metcalf sent four or five of us to see if we could find any thing , and I saw no body in the street . William Tarling . I heard Murder and Thieves cryed out - and by and by the Prisoner was brought into the Watch-house . He seem 'd to be in a great Heat , and said , D - me , let 's have some Beer , The Prosecuter came in and charged him with an attempt to rob him . D - me , says the Prisoner , Detain me at your Peril , my Father is Mr. Horn an Attorney in King-Street Bloomsbury . I have been to Brumpton , where he has got an Estate , and coming home I pick 'd up a Girl at Hide Park Corner , and have been with her ever since . Prosecuter . When he said he was Mr. Horn 's Son , I bid him send for his Father , but he said he would not , for if his Father knew it , he should be ruined . Prisoner . By the Virtue of your Oath , did you not say , when you first came into the Watch house , that you could not swear to my Face ? Constable . When the Prosecuter came into the Watch-house , he view 'd the Prisoner , and said he was positive to the Lines of his Face . - Coming from Justice Deveil 's , the Prisoner jumpt into the Coach , and said , Coachman ! drive me to the Start - I do n't know what he meant by the Start .
