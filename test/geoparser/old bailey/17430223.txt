I must stop you and the Fork : I took the Fork , and locked it up , and sent my Boy for a Constable , and charged the Constable with him ; he said he found it some where by Grosvenor-square .

He said he found them . I told him it would be the most fair and reputable Way to keep them , for there would be Warnings out about them . He said he would sell them presently , for he once found a Gold Watch Case , and carried it to the Gentleman , according as the Advertisement directed , and the Gentleman did not give him any Thing . - He came to me before the Warnings were out , or I had stopped him .

There was a Woman with him , who came into the Shop . He said he had about forty Ounces ; he took a brown Paper from under his Coat , and showed them me ; I asked him how he came by them , and he said he found them ; said I , these Things are certainly stole ; whether you found them or no , if you act like an honest Man , you will keep them by you ; or leave them with me , for there will certainly be Warnings out after them ; he said , he once found a Gold Watch-Case , and found the Owner out by the Coat of Arms , and the Gentleman was so ungenerous that he would not give him any Thing ; and he said , if I would not buy them he would sell them to somebody else directly - there were thirty three Ounces three Quarters . I dogged him out of my Shop into Mr Marlow 's ; I saw him offer two of the Forks to him , and saw Mr Marlow give them to him again , and nod his Head at him ; when he was gone , I said to Mr Marlow , I believe this Man has not come honestly by them , I have a Mind to stop him ; and I would have done it , only I had no Advertisement concerning them . - I asked him his Name , and he said , his Name was James Roberts , and that he lived in Wentworth street , Spital-fields : When I came home I found there were Warnings out to describe the Things ; I got a Constable and went to his House , and they said , he would be at home in a little Time ; I left a Constable over-against the House to take him if he came in , and I went to Mr Neville 's and gave him Information of this Affair .

On the 29th of January , I had brought half a Load of Hay , and half a Load of Straw to Mr Collet 's ; as I was going with it to the Stable , the Prisoner said , I can lead your Fore Horse ; said I , Do you belong to Mr Collet ? He said , yes ; he followed Mr Collet 's Son into the Stable , came running back directly , and said , You must go to the Stable to my Master , and I will give your Horses a Month full of Hay : Make Haste , said he , for he will be in a violent Passion . I staid about four or five Minutes , and when I came back , the bit of Hay which I gave him was flung down by the Shafts of the Cart , and he was gone ; thinks I , surely he will not steal any Thing ; I looked about and my Coat was gone : It was the lower End of Harrow-Alley , without Aldgate ; the Coat hung upon the Cops of the Cart ; he was seen to take it by three or four Boys . I took him the fifth of this Month , at the End of Houndsditch ; he proved very rustical with me , and bit my Hand to the Bone ; he said he would be up with me , I had better let him alone , for he should see me another Time . I took him into the Magpye Tavern ; before I took him in there , he said , Brother Waggoner , I will pay you for it , I will make it up with you : He said another Man stole the Coat , but they both went together to sell it ; that the other Man sold it for two Shillings , and he had Six-pence of the Money . When he was going before my Lord-Mayor , he said , God Almighty bless you , Gentlemen , forgive me this Time , and I will never go about stealing Great-Coats any more . Prisoner . I went to do my Occasions ; another Man run away with the Coat , I went to run after him and could not find him . Elias Collet . On the 5th of this Month I was informed , that the Man was taken who stole the Waggoner 's Great-Coat ; I went to the Magpye Tavern , and asked him how he could be such a Villain to take the poor Fellow 's Coat ; and which I thought was worse , in biting him so , that he might be hindered from getting his Bread : He said , he did not steal the Coat , but another Man , and that he ran after the Man , and the Man sold it in Rag-Fair for 2 s. and he had 6 d. of the Money ; afterwards he said , the Man dropped 6 d. upon the Ground ; then he said it was upon a Stone , and then upon a Brick , and said , if we would forgive him he never would go a Coat-stealing with any Man any more . Prisoner . I saw 6 d. lie upon the Ground and I took it up ; I know nothing of the Great-Coat . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 147.

Mary Prouse . I told the Prisoner I had missed some Things , and to prevent Disputes the best way was to search her Box ; I took hold of some Sheets , which had my Brother 's Name upon them ; said I , Catherine you had these Sheets out of the dark Closet : Said she , Pray , Madam , do not let my Master and Mistress know it : Said I , Catherine take your Things and go about your Business ; ( she was a very good Servant ) she fell down on her Knees and desired I would forgive her , and said , she never did such a Thing before and never would again ; - We are Sisters , the Prosecutors are Brothers-in-law .

Catherine Whitehall .

William Nicholls . The Prisoner asked me to let him roll a Butt into the Yard : I heard a Noise , went out , and saw the Prisoner with some Hoops upon his Shoulder ; I said to my next Door Neighbour , there is some Treachery in this . We put the Head of the Butt together , and there was a Wind-Mill upon it . Said I , this belongs to Execution-Dock . He said there was one knocked down in the Green-Man Yard , in Newcastle-street , with a Wind-Mill upon it , Mr Dove 's Mark , and another with the same Mark in another Place . John Carey . I met the Prisoner with a Butt in Five-Inkborn-Alley , and he desired to roll the Butt up . When I came back , I found the Butt was knocked to Pieces , and the Hoops off , but who did it I can not tell . Another Person deposed he saw a Man rolling a Butt down Whitechapel ; it was not quite Day-light , he seemed to be a stout Fellow , in his own Hair , but was not sure it was the Prisoner . Michael Pemeroy . Mr Dove sent his Servant to me , to know if I would let him send some Butts into my Yard , at the White-Hart in Whitechapel . In the Morning I heard the Butts roll in the Yard .

Charles Laycock . My House was broke open Feb. the 5th , the Fence was broke down at the Bottom of the Sewer in Summer-street , by Hockley in the Hole : They got into the Yard , and in at the one Pair of Stairs Window , by breaking a Pane of Glass , and so opening the Casement : No-body was in the House , when it was broke open ; I fastened it about Twelve at Noon , and returned home about Two in the Morning ; the Chamber-Door was opened , and the Staple wrenched back . I lost all the Goods mentioned in the Indictment , and a Silver Salt . - The Street-Door was locked when I came home , I unlocked it , and found the Yard-Door open : - I suspected the Prisoner , because No-body knew where the Plate was put but himself : He lived in the Neighbourhood , and used to go to Rumford , and unload Carts for us . - I am a Poulterer , and stand in Clare-Market ; he said he never was out that Day , and I can prove he was out , and borrowed a Ripping Chissel . Mary Laycock . I believe the Prisoner to be the Man , because he was often in our House , and used to go backward and forward in our Bed chamber , and all about the House : and has dined with us often , which I did , out of Compassion to his Children and him , as he had a great Family : The Box in which the Plate was , was carried down to the Sewer , and opened with a Ripping Chissel , and a Box with my Husband 's Cloaths , and some Linnen in it , was left in the Sewer , but , there was nothing taken away but the Plate ; and when I searched his House on the Monday following , he had a Spade which was one Farmer Bowden 's ; and I believe , he buried them with that Spade , he said he was not out all Saturday , but he was down at the Ditch-Market , and borrowed a Chissel to take off a Lock . Prisoner . I know nothing of it ; Ask her when I was at her House ? Mary Laycock . He kept a bad House in Black-Mary's-Hole , and I would not suffer him to come to my House upon that Account ; the Parish allowed him a Crown a Week for his Children . A Witness . The Prisoner came to our House to borrow a Chissel to take off a Lock , but I had never an one . Acquitted . 153 . + William Thackham was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-House of Rich . Hollingsworth , between One and Two in the Night , and stealing twenty Pair of Leather Clogs , val . 3 l. and one Pair of Leather Pattens , val . 3 s. the Goods of Richard Hollingsworth , in his Dwelling-House , January 8 . Richard Hollingsworth . I live in Blackmoor-street , Clare-Market : On January the 8th , my House was broke open and I was robbed ; I went to Bed about One o'Clock : The Window-Shutter was up , and all fast as I thought , but the Prisoner had stole the Pin out of the Window Shutter : When I got up about Eight o'Clock on Sunday Morning , I found one of the Shutters was down , and taken away ; the Glass was broke , and all the Goods taken out of the Window , it was a fixed Sash that could not be moved . Missing my Goods , I advertised them , and had some Bills given to the Shoemakers , for I thought they might be sold to some-body of the Trade : Mr Laws came to me , and told me , he believed he had bought some of my Goods ; he said there were two Pair of plain Clogs ; on the Thursday following , he sent his Man with another Pair , I went , and the Prisoner was secured : They were my Cloge , these are the Goods , the Prisoner served his Time with me , which was out about fourteen Months ago ; I charged him with being concerned in the Fact , and he said , that himself , Johnson , and Morris , were concerned in this robbery : On the Saturday Night , he said he watched my Wife into the Closet , and while she was there , he stole the Key and Pin out of the Window ; that they came again about Two o'Clock , and took the Bar and Shutter down , and took the Goods out of the Window ; that they divided them among them . He sold them for Six-pence a Pair less than they cost me . Andrew Laws . The Prisoner brought some Clogs to my House , and I bought them , as I had bought of him several Times before ; I did not suspect them to be stole , till I had seen Mr Hollingsworth 's Advertisement . He came to me again , and I stopped him , and Mr Hollingsworth came and owned the Goods . The Prisoner said , that late on Saturday Night , he watched an Opportunity , when the good Woman 's Back was turned , and whipt the Key and Pin out of the Window-Shutter , and waited till about two or three in the Morning , and then took the Shutter down , broke a Pane of Glass , and took out twenty Pair of Clogs , and one Pair of Leather Pattens ; that they divided them , and there was seven Pair a Piece ; and he impeached two others . - Colonel De Veil asked him whether he had any Body concerned with him , and at first he said no ; the Colonel told him it would be better for him to confess the Truth , as he might have an Opportunity of saving himself ; then he fell a crying , confessed it , and told us his Accomplices ; he said he was the Projector of the Thing , and was concerned with them . Prisoner . Ask him , when he bought them of me , whether he did not think I could make them for the Money he gave me , or that he could buy them of other People so ? Laws . We always buy cheaper of them than we do of a Shop-Keeper . They will sometimes give their Labour away , and they can afford to sell them cheaper than a Shop-Keeper can . I detected him as soon as I suspected they were stole . Prisoner . My Master says he did not see the Shutter down till Eight o'Clock in the Morning ; if it was broke at Two , How could the Watchman go by so often without seeing it , and letting him know it ? Hollingsworth . Then you question whether it was broke open at all ? Prisoner . I do not believe it was broke open ? Elizabeth Wilson . Last Thursday was five Weeks , I landed at Somerset-House ; I came from Billings-gate ; I met a Woman with something in her Apron , and asked her what it was , she said a Pair of Clogs . I asked her what she would have for them , she said Eighteen-pence , and I said I would give her Sixteen-pence ; and I would have bought them , if they would have fitted the Shoes I have on , [ set looked over the Clogs ] Let me see , - these are not them , - these are the Clogs that the Woman offered me , I can swear to them from fifty Pair . Hollingsworth . This Creature goes for his Wife . Wilson . I never went for his Wife , I never saw him before . Prisoner . He has had a Reward for convicting a Man before , and he thinks to take away my Life for the Reward . Hollingsworth . I never was in Court before , but upon the Jury . Wilson . The Prisoner was not the Person that offered me the Clogs , it was a Man and a Woman together , who were selling Things in the Street . Jane Wallis and Frances Grew said they have trusted the Prisoner with Things of Value , and he never wronged them . Guilty of the Felony , acquitted * of the Burglary . * As it may be thought by some Persons , that this Verdict is not exactly agreeable to the Evidence , it may be presumed , that the Reason which the Jury went upon was , that the Prisoner was at least advised , if not encouraged , to confess , in Hopes of being made easy ; and as this Confession was given , as it were , under publick Faith , the Jury might very well throw that out of the Case ; and then there is not sufficient Evidence of the Burglary , for Mr Hollingsworth knew not that his House was broke open till Eight o'Clock in the Morning , and therefore it might have been done after it was Light , in which Case the Offence is not Burglary [ Transportation .

When I went out I locked the Door fast ; I did not leave any Body in the House ; Farmer Squire 's Man , who lives hard by , saw the House open and brought me Word of it ; when I returned , I found the Door open , and that the Goods were taken away . - The Door was not broke open , it was opened some-how by the Lock : The Prisoner was pursued , taken , and brought back ; and he confessed , that he had taken my Things , and said , he should be hanged . They lay in the House in a Basket when he took them . - These are my Things - These are Mr Clarke 's . Richard Fowler . I heard a Cry of Stop Thief as I was at work in the Field ; I laid hold of the Prisoner 's Shoulder and took him ; he said , he should be hanged : He told me the Things were in a Basket ; and that he had thrown them over a Hedge into the Kitchen-Garden . John Freebourn . I asked the Prisoner if he had broke a House open : He said , he had , but he could not tell whose it was ; he said , it was on this Side of the Church , that Way nearer Hammersmith . I asked him , what he thought the Things might be worth ? he said , he believed about 30 s. Prisoner . I have nothing to say for myself ; I leave it to the Court and the Jury . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. || || The Offence this Prisoner was charged with is made capital by 39 Eliz . c. 13. but to make it so highly penal , the Jury must find a breaking , and taking to the Value of 5 s.

I am Butler to Mr Taylor , in Bridewell ; I looked the Plate over on the 13th Day of this Month when my Master went out of Town ; I left it locked up in the Back-Parlour , in the Beauset , and took the Key with me to Stanmore . On Thursday , when my Master came to Town , I found the Beauset was broke open , and the Plate gone , as mentioned in the Indictment ; the biggest Part of the Plate was found ; this is the Cup and Cover which I left in the Beauset , locked up when I went out of Town . ( There was a Silver Sauce-pan and some other Pieces of Plate produced , which were prov 'd to be Mr Taylor 's . ) Rachel Walker . When I went to Bed , on Monday was seven-Night , the Door was locked ; and in the Morning , I found the Beauset was broke open , and the Plate gone : There was a Boat and a Sauce-pan which stood upon the Dresser , they were both gone . - The Door was locked when I went to Bed , and I believe it was barred : - They came in at the Window , up one Pair of Stairs ; the Sash was pushed up . Q . Are you sure the Sash was down , when you went to Bed ? Walker . I am not positively sure , whether the Sash was up or down : There was a Blind before the Sash , when I went to Bed : That was in its Place then ; the Blind goes with Pullies , and was out of its Place in the Morning . Job Steele . In the first Place , Henry Bulley , his Wife Ann Bulley , and I , were at the Ben Johnson 's-Head , in Shoe-lane . ( I never was there three Times in my Life ) The last Night I was there , I was with them ; it was Monday was seven-Night ; and we agreed to rob Esquire Taylor 's House , in Bridewell , that Night . Q . Was you ever Servant to Mr Taylor ? Steele . I never was his Servant . - And accordingly , departing from that House ; we entered into Bridewell undiscovered , without any Suspicion ; and went up a winding Fair of Stairs . - Yes , I do know , because there were four Stories ; but I do not know how high we went : But we went into the House , about Three o'Clock in the Morning ; all Three of us . I was the Person , that entered the House ; and I will tell you , by what Method ; I lay concealed upon the Stairs till Three o'Clock , and then I thought they were all asleep . - At three o'Clock I came into the inner , and then into the outer Court , and Bulley helped me up over the Pallisades ; there was a Sash-Window , which I lifted up and entered in , as better knowing the House than he did ( though he knew it pretty well ) . I went down , opened the Door , and let them in , and they struck a Light with their Tinder-box , which they had with them , and broke the Beauset up ; they filled two Bags , which they carried away with them , and they left more Plate behind , than they took away : They might have taken Plates and Dishes along with them , which they said were Pewter , and they would not take them ; but they were Plate ; it was better than this Trumpery . [ Meaning a Cloth Coat of Ralph Sleigh 's , and a Staw Hat , the Property of Richard Walker , which were laid in the Indictment . ] Court . Was the Window close down when you came to it ? Steele . No , it was not close down by near a Foot , but I could not get into it without pushing it up - They took away all , I had none of it . Q . What had you nothing at all for your Pains ? Steele . No ; I had nothing at all for my Pains . Q . How did they get in ? Steele . I unbarred and unbolted the Door and let them in - at the outer Door of the House - they went directly into the Kitchen and struck a Light with their Tinder-Box , and lighted a Candle ; I shewed them where the Beauset was ; and with a Gimblet and a Knife they opened it , and took out what they pleased ; they made themselves up 2 Packs , and then went into the Kitchen to see what was there , and they took that Sauce-pan ; there was another which was a little blacker than that , which they would not take : I suppose they thought it was not Silver , but they took enough away , and too much too - I am sure the 2 Prisoners are the Persons who took the Plate away , Gentlemen : I have not known the Woman above three Months , but I have known him 20 Years . Q . Do you know she is his Wife ? Steele . I do not know whether she is or not , he has 2 or 3 Wives . Richard Pice . On Sunday Night last , Mr Taylor sent for me , with a Message , that he desired to speak with me ; he said , he believed he had got a Person who would give him Information of the People who had got the Plate : I went with the Person to a House in Horselydown , but I did not see them that Night ; I went over again the next Morning with a Search-Warrant ; there are two Doors to the House , 2 of us went in at the Fore Door , and I and another went in at the Back-Door ; the first Person I saw was Henry Bulley , and I believed , according to the Account that was given me , that he was the Man ; I endeavoured then to know where they lodged , in order to find the Woman , but as I had a Search-Warrant to search the House , I did search Part of it , and they brought me Word the Woman was in the House ; we went into the back Part of the House and found her there , and I found a Wooden-Chest , and in that Chest a Brass Pistol : I found this Plate in the House where the Man was : It is the Sign of the Boatswain and Call , in Horselydown , Fair-street ; I think the Man 's Name is Redrosse ; I believe Bulley came in as a Guest , for they told me he did not lodge there . Ann Bulley . Did you find any Thing about me ? Richard Pice . In the Room she was in , there was a small Silver Spoon found in the Ashes ; I believe they had been burning a pretty many Papers : This little Silver Spoon she had in her Pocket . [ The Spoons were proved to be Mr. Taylor 's by John Avery ; one of them was marked J. T. the other was marked M. H. B . A. Ann Bulley said that was her own Spoon ; and Mr Taylor said , the M. was for Mustard , it was a Mustard Spoon , and that the Letters H. B . A. were fresh made ] This Spoon was found in the Ashes . Council . We shall now prove how this Plate was carried about from one Place to another . John Gyles . ( Coachman ) My Stand is by White-Chapel Bars : Last Thursday was sen'night , between Twelve and One , the Prisoner at the Bar ( the Man ) came to me and asked for a Hackney-Coachman to go to Dulwich ; I called a Hackney-man out of the House ; I do not know whether he asked him 8 or 10 Shillings ; the Prisoner bid him six ; I said , I could get him a Chaise and Pair for 7 Shillings , which I did , and took him up and carried him to Wentworth-street , Spital-fields , and took up a Portmantean-Trunk , and put it into the Hay-Bag , and a little square Box , with Nobs at the Bottom . - This is the Box ; the Box was very heavy - the Box was put into the Chaise . - This is the Trunk ; I was ordered to go to the Bell at Dulwich , and unluckily the Portmanteau burst open on the Road ; I saw there was Plate in it , but I could not tell whether it was Pewter or Silver ; and when I had sat him down I came away , and then I was to go and fetch that Woman which I did , and two Dogs . - I left this Box and Trunk with Henry Bulley , at the Bell at Dulwich . - He paid my Mistress before I went with him . Charles Shooler . I took the two Prisoners up at the Flying-horse , in Lambeth-street , and carried them to the Fox under the Hill , at Camberwell ; and then went to the Bell at Dulwich , and brought from thence , a four cornered Box : That is the Box , and a hairy Portmanteau Trunk ; that I believe is the Trunk : And I carried them into Horselydown , Fair-street , to the Boatswain and Call , and set both the Man and the Woman down there : She took another four cornered Trunk out of that Trunk : - I left the Trunk and the Box there below Stairs . Richard Pice . I believe , this is the Trunk ; Mr Taylor 's Plate was in , when I found it : - There is all the Reason in the World to believe so ; I left it behind me : But there are the Marks of the Blows , which I made with the Hammer , when I broke it open . - I took the Plate out of a Bag , which was in that Trunk . Prisoner , Ann Bulley . I desire that Box may be opened : ( Which was done , and a Pistol taken out ) Whose Pistol is that ? It is his Pistol . Job Steele . I know the Pistol very well . - I own it to be my Pistol . Ann Bulley . Whose Things are those ? ( A Pair of Pistols , and two dark Lanthorns were taken out of the Box . ) Job Steele . What signifies my knowing of these Things . I know them very well : These Pistols are your 's , I have seen you handle them many a Time : - These two Dark Lanthorns , I believe , are the Lanthorns we made Use of at Mr Taylor 's House . - All the Things in the Box , were Bulley 's , except one Pistol . Ann Bulley . The Man who is the Evidence is the Person who sent the Box with the Plate in it under our Care : He sent it by an unknown Hand , and I did not know how he came by it . - Elliot . I saw Job Steele come into Bridewell , with a Man and a Woman with him , on Monday was se'ennight , a small Matter before Eleven o'Clock at Night . Q . Do you know whether the Prisoners were the Persons . - Elliot . By their Size they are the same ; I did not see their Faces . - I am sure Job Steele was one , I have seen him more than an hundred Times , and know it was him . Andrew Culley . On Shrove-Tuesday , about half an Hour after Five in the Morning , I met both the Prisoners coming out of Bridewell loaded , and I thought they were going a Country-Journey , because they went out Bag and Baggage at that Time in the Morning . I had no Suspicion of them , if I had I should have stopped them . Q. to Ann Bulley . Are you married to Henry Bulley ? Ann Bulley . I can not say I am not married to him ? Henry Bulley . She is my Wife . [ Council for the Prosecutor offered to prove that he had another Wife ; the Court would not enter into that , as they acknowledged they were married . ] Henry Bulley . I desire to ask Steele some Questions . I desire the Box may be opened again , and the Brass Pistol taken out ; Whose Pistol is that ? Job Steele . I never saw the Box before in my Life ; I know nothing of the Brass Pistol . These other two Pistols I have seen often enough ; you had them when you lived at my House ; that other Pistol is mine , I have owned it . Henry Bulley . Steele sent this Plate to me by an unknown Hand . Henry Bulley guilty , Death . Ann Bulley acquitted , as being present with her Husband , and supposed to act under his Direction . 157 . + Thomas Kendred , of St. Paul , Covent-Garden , was indicted for being present , aiding and assisting William Vaughan and William Stanley , in the Murder of Edmund Acornley , November 9 . Widow Acornley . On the 9th of November last , my Husband went out well , and in a Quarter of an Hour returned wounded and bruised in a very barbarous Manner . - I keep a public House . William Vaughan and Thomas Kenared used him very ill . Hearing a Noise , he went out into the Street with other Company that were drinking in the House : My Husband was never well afterwards . William Temple Blithman . I am a Painter . I happened to be in the House sitting by this Gentlewoman 's Husband , and there was a Noise in the Court , in Castle-Court , among some young Fellows who had picked a Quarrel ; I took a Candle and went out to see what was the Matter ; when I came into the Court , William Vaughan and Thomas Kendred , and one that I did not know , were fighting : Vaughan had been in another House in Castle-Court : The Deceased stepped cross , and William Vaughan gave him a Blow and struck him down ; that was the first Blow I saw . - I did not see any Thing in his Hand . The Man was down and there he lay : I saw no-body strike him but William Vaughan . - Thomas Kendred did not strike the Deceased . The Man was kick 'd but I did not see it . Ann Middleton . I live in Castle-Court . Our House was shut up ; but hearing a great Noise in the Court , I listened to hear what was the Matter ; there were a great many violent hard Words used : I opened the Door and saw the Deceased in the Court ; he did not say any Thing : I saw the Prisoner there , but I did not see him strike a Blow ; I shut the Door , and in a few Minutes I opened the Door again , and I think I heard the Blow that knocked the Deceased down . I saw Mr Vaughan and one Stanley who had an Oak-Stick in his Hand : The Prisoner was not near the Deceased when the Damage was done to him . I saw the poor Man raised upon his Backside : It was either Vaughan or Stanley that knocked him down . I spoke to Vaughan and Stanley , and asked them , what they were doing of , and told them , they did not know what Damage they might come to , or what Mischief they might do . John Bright . I was going down the Court when this Fight was ; I went out with the Deceased ( who was my Father-in-law ) with a Candle in my Hand , to see what was the Matter ; there were a great many more run out ; and I saw Vaughan knock the Deceased down ; the Prisoner came up , but that was after the Blow was given . Vaughan kick 'd the Deceased both with his Feet and Knees . Q . Did Vaughan fall down upon the Deceased ? Bright . No , he stood upright ; the Deceased was cut over his Eye and under his Eye . - I did not see any Thing the Prisoner did : Vaughan said , What 's he one of them ? - that is , was the Deceased one of them . There was an Affidavit of the Deceased 's offered to be produced ; but it being made six Weeks before the Death of the Party , and not in Articulo Mortis ; and it being made with an Intent , as was alledged , to hold a Person to Bail , it was not admitted to be given in Evidence . [ One Martin was produced , but he could only give an Account of what he heard the Deceased say ; so he was not examined ] - Bates , the Surgeon 's Apprentice . The Deceased 's chief Complaint all his Illness was in his Stomach : my Master opened him , I can not say what was the Occasion of his Death : he had one Wound over his Eye and another underneath . John Perkins , Surgeon . I saw the Deceased about three Days after this unfortunate Affair happened ; the Reason I sent my Apprentice was , I thought it to be only a common Quarrel , and I love to keep out of those Things if I can : My Servant gave me an Account in what Manner he was wounded , he had one of his Teeth beat out , and had a Wound upon his Forehead ; I visited him several Times , he complained of Bruises ; he had declined taking of Things some time before he died , I apprehended the Reason of that was , for fear of Expences : I opened him the 16th of this Month . Q . Did you see any Thing when you opened him , by which you can swear , what was the Occasion of his Death ? Perkins . All the Inwards of the Body were perfectly found , except the Left Lobe of the Liver ; I made an Incision and found an Imposthume in it : I understand he had been an ailing Man before , and had lately had a Fever ; the Fever might have settled there , and have been the Occasion of the Imposthume : - I believe this might hasten his Death . - The Blow he had on the Head could not occasion that Disorder in the Body ; a Blow on the Body will too often occasion an inward Disorder . Acquitted . 158 . + Charles Tanner was indicted for assaulting Peter Poule , on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear and taking from him five Pound of Bohea Tea , the Property of the said Peter Poule . At the Prisoner 's Desire , the Witnesses were examined apart . Peter Poule . On the 18th of January , the Prisoner came to my Master 's in Mint-square , on the other Side of the Water ; and said he wanted two Dozen of Tea , one Dozen of Green , and one Dozen of Bohea , for a Gentleman 's Servant in Grosvenor's-square , - My Master 's Name is Prior , he sells Tea and Sugar , & c. My Master told me , he had not so much Tea in the House , and could not serve him ; and gave me leave to do it , and told me where I could get the Tea to serve Charles Tanner with . - I went and bought two Dozen of Tea at an Inn in the Borough , of a Sussex Man : - My Master owed me 8 l. for four Years Wages , and he had paid me the Money : I bought one Dozen of Green , and one Dozen of Bohea , and gave 6 l. 10 s. for it ; and I was to have 7 l. 4 s. if the Gentleman 's Servant liked it ; I was to go with the Prisoner to Grosvenor's-square , I took one Dozen over at a Time , I carried five Pound , four Pound in a Band-box , and two half Pounds in my Pockets , and he carried seven Pound in a Basket ; we went over the Water : and he carried me to the two Brewers , at the Corner of Nibs 's Pound , by Tyburn-Road : He said he was going to Esquire Boothby 's in Grosvenor's-square , and took the Basket with the seven Pound of Tea with him ; says he , You must give me the Box with the four Pound , and the two half Pounds out of your Pocket ; I gave it him , and he brought me my Box again : Said I , Mr Tanner , Why do n't you give me the Money for it ? He said , the Gentleman 's Servant would not give him the Money for that , till he had the other Dozen ; we came back and fetched the other Dozen . I had a Link coming over St George the Martyn's-fields , and lighted him till we came to the two Brewers by Nibs 's Pound : He not paying me for the first , I thought he would cheat me , and was resolved to see where he was going with the Tea ; just before he came to the Place , says he , You must not go along with me to the House , they will be angry ; says I , Mr Tanner , Why not ? I may pass for your Cousin there 's no Harm in that ; he said the Gentleman 's Servant would come to the Two-Brewers and pay him : I said I would see where the Goods went to , and then he said , Put out your Link , you Rogue ; and before he came to Mary Sutton 's House , he said , D - n your Blood , give me the two half Pounds of Tea . He took the Tea out of my Pocket . - It was cut out of my Pocket . Here is the Cut he made to get it out . Then he went into Mrs Sutton 's about Ten o'Clock ; says she , Lord , Mr Tanner , What do you do here , at this Time of Night ? He asked who was in the House ; says she , There 's no Body in the House but Thomas . He called Thomas , and then he said to me , D - n your Blood , you little Dog , give me the Box ; and he took the Box , which was in a Handkerchief , and gave it to Thomas , and he run away with it . He sat down in the House a little while , and I asked him what he meant by taking the Tea from me ; he said , D - n your Blood , you Dog , what makes you uneasy , the Man will come with the Money presently ; and a little while after , he went towards the Door , and run away from me ; when Thomas came back , I asked him what he had done with the Goods , he said he had carried them to the Two-Brewers , and that Tanner then took them away from him . I did not know what to do for a Lodging , and they let me lie at the Two-Brewers , and I gave them two-pence for it . I knew Tanner belonged to the Horse-Grenadiers , and I knew the Corporal . I went to the House where Tanner lodged , and knocked at the Room-Door , and asked for him ; says a Woman that lay with him , - I do not know whether she is his Wife or not ; says she , he is not within ; What do you want with him ? Said I , I want to speak with him . I listened at the Door , and heard him whispering ; said I , Mr Tanner , I want to speak with you ; D - n your Blood , says he , What do you want ? Says I , you know what I want , you know you robbed me last Night ; I want nothing but what you robbed me of , or my Money : He got up , and said I should have it ; but he never would give me either Goods or Money . Says he , D - n your Blood , and threatened me if I did not go back what he would do to me . I knew the Captain , and went to him , and he sent him to the Black-Hold . Then he said , a Custom-House-Officer had taken the Goods from him by St Giles 's Pound , and when he found the Commitment was made for him to go to New-Prison , he owned where the Tea was ; that there was nine Pound at Mr Lovelace 's , ten Pound in another Place , three Pound at another , and two Pound his Wife had . Prisoner . Ask him whether I took the Pound of Tea away from him before I came to Mrs Sutton 's , or whether I did not say , Let me have the Pound , of Tea which is in your Pocket , for this is the House I was coming to , I will send the Tea away here ? Poule . You did not say any such Thing ; you cursed and swore at me , and said you would have it , and cut my Pocket to get it out . James Lovelace . I keep a Publick-House ; one Tuesday , Tanner brought a Basket to my House , and desired it might be put by safe for him , and I said to my Wife , Dame , Mr Tanner desires this to be put by for him . I did not know what it was , but when it came to be enquired for , I found it to be Tea ; it was put into a brown Paper Bag , and my Wife 's Sister carried it to Justice De Veil . Mary Sutton . Charles Tanner came to my House one Tuesday Night , between Nine and Ten ; this Boy was with him with a Link and a Bundles , says he , Who have you at Home ? Says I , there 's Thomas ; he went up Stairs , and said , Hollo , Thomas , Thomas ; Thomas answered him , and he went up to Thomas 's Room . The Boy had something that looked like a square Bundle tied up in a Handkerchief . I saw him take it from the Boy , and the Boy said , What do you mean by that , Sir . - The Boy said he must have the Money before he delivered the Goods ; he took it from the Boy , and gave it to Thomas , and bid him go where he told him . I was afraid he was coming to do me some Mischief , - because he did not pay me a little Matter that he owed me , and I went after him for the Money . Poule . There was four Pound of Tea in that Handkerchief in a Bandbox , which he took from me at Mrs Sutton 's . - Stafford . I live in Oxford Road , the Prisoner , one Thursday , left a Basket , and something tied in a Handkerchief like a Wig-box , and desired I would let those Things stand there till he came off Guard . I never knew the Man before ; he sent for them away , but I was not at Home then . Ann King deposed , that Prior came to ask her Husband whether he knew any Body who was well enough acquainted with Tanner , to help him to the Money for the Tea . Ann Sadler . I was at the White-hart in Gravel-Lane , on the other Side of the Water , and heard Tanner agree with Prior for twenty-four Pound of Tea , and he was to pay him for it when he had sold it ; and he said he was very welcome to the Tea , if he was an honest Man , and would pay him for it . - I did not hear him say who the Tea was for . - I do not know whether he deals in Tea . - I do not know what he was to pay him for it . - He said it was for a Customer , that he could help him to the selling of it . - I happened to go to the White-hart for a Pint of Beer , and heard this . - I live in Smithfield . - I have an Aunt lives in Little Bandyleg Walk . - I call in sometimes for a Pint of Beer there . - I do not know which Side of the Way the White-hart is on . Thomas Sagewell deposed , that Tanner called him down Stairs at Mrs Sutton 's , delivered him the Goods at the Door , and ordered him to carry them to the Two-Brewers , and promised to follow him directly ; that he carried them to the Two-Brewers , but Tanner not coming to him , he brought the Things back , and took them into his own Room , and that Tanner came for them the Thursday Night following . Tanner lodged three Weeks or a Month in Mrs Sutton 's House . I did not know him before that . Margaret Heatley . I heard this old Woman ( Mrs Sutton ) say , that the Prisoner owed her four Shillings for Lodging , and deserved to be hanged , because he would not pay her ; and I heard the Boy say he was robbed at Tyburn . Prisoner . Prior had me confined , and kept me four Days upon Bread and Water , in Order to make this Affair up . Prior is a Prisoner in the King 's Bench , and therefore can not be brought here . Peter Poule was called again , and asked how he came by the Money to buy the Tea . Poule . My Master had paid me eight Pound some Time before for Wages . I was going out Apprentice to a Shipwright at Woolwich , and this Money was to buy me Cloaths . - I am almost sixteen Years of Age . - My Master belonged to the Guards , and Tanner came on the other Side of the Water , to see some Men that belonged to the Troop , and came for some Tea , and my Master not having the Tea , he gave me the Privilege of buying it . Guilty of the Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 159 . + Ann Bradford was indicted for stealing Nineteen Guineas , the Money of William Brown , in the Dwelling-House of John Lancaster , Feb 16 . William Brown . On the 16th of February , I dined at Mrs Paterson 's in Church Court , with one Brown , who came in the Ship with me from Portsmouth , and this Woman ; I belong to a Man of War : This Brown , and another Person , wanted me to go to Lancaster 's , it was about Eight o'Clock at Night ; Mr Johnson , and I went there , and the Prisoner got a Bottle of Rum and Brandy , and made a Bowl of Punch , and after the Bowl was drank out , I said I must go , and threw down half a Crown for it ; but she would not let us go , I told her the Punch was very strong , and that if she made it so strong , she must drink it herself ; she made another Bowl , I told my Friend , I had got a Charge of Money about me , that I must not be too free in drinking : I pulled out my Money , which was Nineteen Guineas , and counted it upon the Table ; she desired to count it , and did count it , and said , Here is Nineteen Guineas sort enough : She took the Money up , and went from the Table with it in her Hand ; I asked her for my Money , she said I need not be afraid of my Money , for she would not take it away , if there was a Thousand Pound , or something like it : I asked here where she was going , she said , to make a little Maid 's Water , and I heard something make a rattling like Water , when that was done , I gave her a little Time ; then I looked for her , and she was gone ; said I , She has flung us ; there was a little Girl about Eight or Nine Years old , that belonged to her , said she was gone to buy a Fowl and Bacon . I went to one Mr Kirkpatrick 's , and informed him of what had happened , and he went along with me ; she came back in about an Hour and an Half , and was asking for her Child ; says the Woman of the House , Do n't you know the Woman that robbed you ? That 's the Woman : Mr Kirkpatrick , desired me to go to Justice Frazer 's and get a Warrant , and he kept her in the House till I got a Warrant , and they carried her to the Round-house , and took her up Stairs to search her ; the Constable said , You must not burt the Woman , you must be gentle with her ; she wanted to go to the Little-house , but the Constable would not let her , she was searched , and the Money took from under her Arm-pits ; then I told her , she might go to the Little-house , and she said , You be d - d , Sir , I do not want to go to the Little-house , any more than you ; she said , the Money was mine , and desired I might have it , there were Eighteen Guineas , and she said , she would give me a Bond , or Note , for the rest . Prisoner . Did not you lend me the Money upon my Powers , till such Time I could receive my Money ; for I had 200 l. to receive ? William Brown . No : I did not , she took it from me . - I do not know that she went to buy any Bacon , or a Fowl : - There was no talk of lending a Farthing , for I never saw her before in my Life : - I never saw a Paper of her 's . Prisoner . Upon his lending me the Money I went out for a Fowl . Francis Johnson . I was with the Prosecutor at Lancaster 's and had a Bowl of Punch ; after that was out we had another ; Brown pulled his Money out and counted it , and she counted it , and took it off the Table ; says he , What have you to do with my Money ? says she , Sir , you need not be afraid of your Money , if it was ten thousand Pounds : She said , she wanted to make Water ; he gave her Liberty to go , and it was not 2 Minutes before she made off : She was taken up , and I saw the Money taken from her , there were 18 Guineas , it was concealed somewhere about her Breast . She told the Justice if he would take his Money again and make it up , she would give him a Note for what she had made away with ; and sometimes she said , he lent it her . - He was not disguised with Liquor . I was pretty sober ; there was not above a Quarter of the second Bowl drank when this happened . Prisoner . Did not I go out to buy a Fowl , Bacon , and Greens ? Johnson . She made a Proposition of a Supper , but we refused it . Q . Did you persist in the Refusal all the while ? Johnson . She brought out a Bit of cold Pork , and said , we should eat that if we would eat nothing else . - She did not bring any Fowl home . Prisoner . I left it at the Tavern to be dressed . Q . Did she pull any Navy-Bills , or Powers , out of her Pocket ? Johnson .

Alexander Kirkpatrick . On the 16th of February , about nine o'Clock , Mr Brown came to my House , and said , he was robbed ; I went along with him , and entreated the Prisoner to give up the Money . I offered her one Guinea , and at last I came up to two , rather than have any farther Trouble ; she said she had borrowed it for two Days , and she would give it him again when she was able and willing . She said she did not mind a Warrant ; we took her to the Watch-house , and kept her till the Beadle came , and then she was searched , and eighteen Guineas were found about her Breast . When she came before the Justice , she was in a Swoon ; and she fell down upon her Knees , and said she would give Bond for any Thing he would , to make Satisfaction . Prisoner . Do you know any Thing of me ? Kirkpatrick . No , I never heard any Harm of you till now . - I never spoke to her in my Life before ; I have heard some People give her an indifferent Character . Prisoner . Mr Kirkpatrick , when you used to come to my House with a Girl , you did not use to give me such a Character . William Houghton . I was Constable of the Night , the Prisoner was brought to St Martin 's Round-House , and was very abusive ; I desired her to go up to be searched , but she would not ; the Beadle said if she would not go up , she must go down , so he went down Stairs with her ; she desired to go to the Vault first ; I had not Presence of Mind just then , but I presently recollected myself ; Thinks I , she has certainly got this Money , and wants to convey it away . She said she had something to do that was not proper to be done before Men . I told her I would not suffer her to do it till she was searched . She was very unwilling to have her Gown pulled off . I found she was guilty by her Looks . The Beadle untied two of her Petticoats , and I told her I would search her to her Smock , if she would not confess ; she seemed to pull something out of her Pocket , and went to conceal it , as I suppose , under her Arm Pits , but the Beadle caught it in her Hand before she could convey it there - She did say she borrowed it of the Prosecutor , and that she would trounce me for robbing of her . Prisoner . I said , What Business have you with my Money ? And I said I would pay him very honourably when I received my Money in Broad Street . Houghton . She did not say any Thing of paying any Money in my Hearing ; she said she had a Bill to receive of the Duke of Newcastle ; ( the eighteen Guineas were produced by the Constable ) that Purse and Money I took from her ; I offered her the Purse and she would not take it . Prisoner . That is my Purse , and my Money which he lent me . Robert Bushel ( the Beadle ) confirmed the other Evidence , and said , that he observed she was going to put something into her Bosom , that he put his Hand in after her , and took the Money in her Hand , and delivered it to the Constable . Prisoner . I told them I would make them pay dear for robbing me , and beating me , and thumping me . Bushel . I used her as tenderly as if she was a Child . Prisoner . I have served the Earl of Pembroke , the Duke of Portland , and others of the Nobility , and have lived in Credit and Reputation ; there is not a Woman in the Parish of St James 's has a better Character I have served the Duke of Marlborough seven Years ; I have served Madam Valmont , and a great many noble Persons . - Evans .

I have known her sixteen Years , and never heard any Ill of her ; she was always an industrious Woman and worked for her Children and her Mother . Thomas Welling . I heard the Prosecutor say , he had lost his Money , and he charged the Prisoner with taking it ; I think it was eighteen Guineas ; she made a Laugh at it ; there were 2 Gentlemen there who desired him to get a Warrant ; I was the Person that went for the Warrant ; I thought it very hard that a Woman of the Town should pick a Man 's Pocket of so much Money . Said I , Did you know the Woman before ? Yes , said he , I know her very well at Portsmouth , she used to come on board the Ship with Goods . Said I , How came she to get your Money ? said he , I left it with her because I thought to be out all Night upon the Rake ; says he , I knew my Money was very safe , because I knew she was to receive some Money in a little Time , and that she could not run away . He told me , that a Friend or two of his and her 's came to Town to be Goods , and that their Acquaintance had laid out 40 or 50 Pounds at Pawnbrokers Shops , and other Places that the Prisoner had taken them to . The Prosecutor was called again and asked , whether this was true he said , He never saw Woman before that Day , and did not know any Money being laid out at any Pawnbroker and said , the Witness Welling , was very serviceable to him that Night , and very ready to help him in getting a Warrant , and securing the Prisoner . Elizabeth Carlow . I have known her ever since she was seven Years of Age ; she always bore Character of a very honest Woman . Her Husband is on board one of his Majesty 's Ships . Guilty Death .

Court . When you come upon your Trial we will take Notice of it , but we have nothing to do with it till then . When the Trial came on his Irons were ordered to be taken off . Before the Jury were sworn it was asked , on the Part of the Prisoner , whether any of them were Proprietors of the Bank , or Indorsers of Bank Bills of Exchange , because if they were they could not , by Reason of their Interest , be upon the Jury , but none of 'em being so , they were accordingly sworn . Waite . My Lord , I beg there may be a profound Silence , for I have caught Cold since I have been in Prison , and can not hear well at this Distance . The Council for the King * opened the Indictment , by acquainting the Court and the Jury , that the Prosecutors , who are the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , had brought before them the Prisoner at the Bar , to take his Trial for stealing a great Number of East-India Bonds , the Property of the Bank ; That till the Statute of the second Year of his present Majesty , the stealing of Bonds , & c. was not made Felony ; for such Securities for Money not being frequent in ancient Times , the common Law had not made a proper Provision to punish People for stealing them ; but as these are now become a valuable Part of our Property , the Legislature had thought proper to make the stealing of East-India Bonus , and other public Securities , Felony , as the stealing of Goods or Money is at Common Law ; That they hoped to be able to lay the Case before them , in such a Manner , as would bring it Home to the Prisoner , that he was the Stealer of these Bonds within the Meaning of that Law ; and took Notice , that the Occasion of these Bonds coming to be placed in the Bank of England , was upon the Deficiency of some of the Masters in the High Court of Chancery , who were possessed of valuable Effects of the Suitors ; whereupon , by an Act , in the Twelfth of George I . Cap . xxxii . it is directed , That all these Securities should be sent to the Bank of England , and that they , on giving Receipts for them , make themselves answerable for them , whatever becomes of them afterwards : When they are in their Possession , it is at the Peril of the Bank of England if they are lost , and therefore they are laid to be the Property of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England ; and as these Bonds were lost , they had been forced to buy others , and replace them ; and that therefore there could be no Doubt ; but that these Bonds were the Property of the Bank of England ; but that if there should be any Difficulty arise upon that , in Point of Law , they are likewise laid to be the Property of Persons unknown . That when any Bonds are brought in , the Person who receives them , gives an Account to the Directors in waiting , and they are deposited in a Chest , in the Committee-Room , and afterwards put into the Valut , in the securest Manner that can be ; and it is uncertain to whom these belong , till the Matter depending between the Litigants in the Court of Chancery is determined ; and these Securities are never taken out but for the Purpose of receiving the Interest , or delivering them back by Order of the Court of Chancery . * The Council for the Prosecution were Sir John Strange , Mr Bootle and Mr Purchas . Of Council with the Prisoner , Serjeant Wynne , Serjeant Agar , Serjeant Kettleby , and Serjeant Hayward . They then stated the Circumstances relating to these six Bonds with which the Prisoner was charged , and to which only their Evidence would be consined : That in 1736 , there being then a great Number of East-India Bonds in the Custody of the Bank ; and the East-India Company resolving to reduce the Interest , that made it necessary to apply to the Court of Chancery , to have the taken out and exchanged for the Company 's new Bonds ; and that some of these Bonds would appear to be some of those Bonds which were thus brought to the Bank upon such Exchange ; that as soon as they were brought there , they were carried to the Account of the particular Persons to whom they belonged , and the Prisoner himself gave Receipts for them , which should be produced : That on the 21st of April , the Court of Chancery , in the Cause of Broome and Broome , ( that Cause being then at an End ) ordered seventeen Bonds which were in the Bank to be delivered out ; they went to the Bank to receive these Bonds , and seventeen Bonds were delivered them , by the Prisoner at the Bar ; but those not being the same identical Bonds which were described in the Cause , but of different Numbers , upon this there was an Application made to the Bank , to get the right Bonds ; and the Directors desired Mr Waite to look them out accordingly . Nobody thought there was any Thing unfair in it , but that he had taken the seventeen uppermost Bonds without any particular Reason ; this occasioned an Enquiry , and the Prisoner said he would look into it , and set it right ; but no Body suspecting him , he took an Opportunity of getting away ; and though there were frequent Advertisements , with great Rewards for the apprehending him , there was nothing heard of him till he was taken in Ireland , about two or three Months ago . That Mr Waite going away in this Manner , occasioned a farther Enquiry : He had a little Desk at the Bank , wherein they imagined there might be some Bonds ; this Desk was ordered to be broke open , and there were two Bonds in it , which were a little before brought in by Order of the Court of Chancery . That as these Bonds were taken away , the Bank had endeavoured to trace them , in order to know how they had been disposed of , and by whom ; and were able to prove that the Prisoner at the Bar carried six of them to a Broker , said they were his own ; that the Broker sold them for him , and that the Money was paid into his own Hands ; and from thence they hoped it would appear , that the Bonds were stolen by him , and that he applied the Money to his own Use ; that there would be a little Difference as to the Evidence , with Respect to some of the Bonds : These Six , being all the Bonds they could trace , it would be proper to state upon what Account they were brought into the Bank . As to No . A 2336 , and No . A . 2337 , these were brought in , in the Cause of Draper and Pit , before the Time , that the Occasion of exchanging with the East-India Company arose , and were Part of those new Bonds which were to be replaced in that Cause . There were Thirty-six Bonds for 3600 l. from No . A . 2306 , to No . A . 2341 , both inclusive , and the Prisoner gave a Receipt for these Bonds , dated July 23 , 1737 ; which says , they are received for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England . Then there is No . 2740 , brought in , in the Cause of Boswell and Smiter ; this Bond was delivered into the Hands of the Prisoner at the Bar , and he gave the like sort of a Receipt for this , as he did for the other two : Then these three No . 9671 , 20311 , 23335 , were brought in by Order of the Court of Chancery , in the Cause of Wheeler and Harvey , ( there were twenty in all ) these were brought to the Bank , when the Prisoner happened not to be there , and were delivered to another Cashier , but upon the Prisoner 's Return , as he was the Person that principally managed this A ffair , they were delivered to him ; and these are three of those Bonds which they should prove were sold by the Order , and on the Account of the Prisoner at the Bar , and if so , there would remain no Doubt at all , that the Charge was brought home to the Prisoner . That considering the Nature of the Case as it stands together , his disposing of these Bonds clandestinely , without any Sort of Authority , without communicating it to any Person belonging to the Bank , or concerned for the Bank ; clandestinely conveying away these Bonds , delivering them into Mr Willoughby 's Hand , as his own , directing him to sell and dispose of them , receiving the Money for them , and converting it to his own Use ; these Bonds being taken out of a great Number which were under his Care ; his not carrying away the whole Number , but separating of them , and converting them into Money for his own Use , in Fraud of the Bank , in Fraud of the Suitors , ( if they had not Reparation made them by the Bank ) and in Fraud to all Mankind ; putting the Money into his Pocket and running away with it : If considering it in this Light , and under these Circumstances , this should not be allowed to be a felonious taking , what upon Earth could be said to be a felonious taking : What is the Difference between this and going to the Coffers of the Bank and taking out so much Money ? the Bank are equal Sufferers , for they are to make this good : If he had got by this iniquitous Way 5000 l. it is the same as if he had gone to their Coffers and taken 500 l. out of them : That always , in these Cases , of great Weight ; that the Jury are to enquire whether the Prisoner sled for it or no ; the Law had a good Intention in that , for flying is an Institution of Guilt . That the Indictment is laid for stealing these Bonds out of a Dwelling-House , which takes from the Prisoner the Benefit of the Clergy ; and the Bank is the Dwelling-House , where the Accomptant-General used to live with his Family , and if any Doubt were made of that they were prepared to make it appear in Point of Law , to be a Dwelling-House ; and it is not laid , in the Indictment , to be the Dwelling-House of any particular Person , but properly and cautiously laid to be a Dwelling-House , wherein Zerubbabel Crouch , and divers other Persons to the Jurors unknown , did then and there inhabit ; and this was done to prevent any Inconvenience that might arise from laying it as the Dwelling-House of a Body corporate . In like Manner , as in the Case of Bambridge , Warden of the Fleet , that Prison was laid to be a Dwelling-House , wherein A . B. and divers other Persons , to the Jurors unknown , did inhabit . ( Gabriel Martin sworn . ) Counc . Look out Draper against Pit , the 15th of July , 1730 . Martin . I examined this at the Register-Office , it is a true Copy , At the Rolls the 15th Day of July , 1730 , & c. [ This was an Order of the Court , for the positing in the Bank two East-India Bonds in this Cause . Mr Martin then produced the Order for taking out the old East-India Bonds , and exchanging them for new ones , dated the 10th of July , 1741 . Mr Pyle . I belong to the Report-Office , in the Court of Chancery , these are what were filed there , the 23d of July , 1737 , that is the Original filed in the Office . Mr Waite 's Receipt produced . Mr Race . I do believe , the Name of John Waite , to be the Prisoner 's Hand-Writing . - The Receipt was read . - Signed John Waite , London , July 23d . 1737 . Received of the East-India Company , Thirty six new East-India Bonds , No . and Dates following , for l. 3600 , No . A . 2306 , to 2341. both inclusive , dated the 27th of June , 1737 . Interest due from the 31st of March last , exchanged for Bonds of the like Value , which Bonds are placed to the Account of Mark Thurston , Esquire , Accomptant-General of the Court of Chancery , in the Cause of Draper against Pit , for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England . Counc . This proves No . 2336 , and 2337 . Another Exhibit the 9th of December , 1740 , Boswell and Smiter . Mr Martin . This is a true Copy . The Order was read , importing that John Bosanquet , and Henry Gambier , were to deposit three East India Bonds in the Bank . Mr Pole , of the Report Office , produced another Receipt of Mr Waite 's . Mr Race . The Name John Waite , I believe , to be Mr Waite 's Hand-Writing . - The Receipt road . - Signed John Waite , London , December 22 , 1740 . Received of John Bosanquet , and Henry Gambier , pursuant to an Order of the 9th of December , the three following Bonds ; No . 2738 , No . 2739 , No . 2740. dated the 1st of July , 1737 , for 100l . each , on which Bonds the Interest is due from the 31st of March , 1738 , and which Bonds are placed to the Account of Mark Thurston , Esquire , Accomptant General , to the Court of Chancery , in the Cause of Boswell against Smiter , for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England . Pris Counc . to Mr Gambier . Are you a Proprietor of Bank-Stock ? Gambier . No . King 's Counc . If he was , that is no Objection : Here is a Receipt of Mr Waite 's read for 3 Bonds , delivered into the Bank , the 22d of December , 1740 . Do you know any Thing of placing these Bonds there ? Gambier . I was not at the Bank , Mr Bosanquet went himself ; I was a Trustee - My Name was made Use of , but Mr Bosanquet did transact it . - These 3 Bonds , No . 2738 , 2739 , and 2740 , were placed in the Bank . Pris . Counc . The Gentlemen of the other Side have mentioned 3 Bonds to you , whose Property were they ? Gambier . They were in Dispute between Mrs Guiguer , Smiter , and Boswell ; they were deposited in the Bank by Order of Doctors-Commons , where a Will was contested . - They never were in my Possession . - It was the Will of Mrs Eunice Gilbert that was contested : This will was never proved ; I believe the Matter was made up . King 's Counc . 'T is a special Property ; a Carrier has a special Property and may bring an Action of Trover . Court . They do not open it , that the Bank of England have an absolute Property in these Bonds , but they have a special Property as they are answerable for them ; and they are answerable to those who are the absolute Proprietors of them , who are the Suitors in the Court of Chancery . King 's Counc . In the Cause of Wheeler and Harvey , Mr Martin proved an Order , dated March 18 1740 , to deposit in the Bank 20 East-India Bonds , for 100l . each , to be placed to the Credit of this Cause ( among which , were the Numbers 9671 , 20311 , and 23335 ) ordering , that the Interest be paid to the Plantiff , Charles Wheeler . As to these 3 Bonds we have not the same Receipt for them as we have for the others ; for Mr Waite was not there when they were brought , but they came into his Hands immediately . ( Mr Collyer sworn . ) Q . What Office were you in , in the Bank , in April 1741 ? Mr Collyer . I was then one of the Cashiers . Q . Do you remember any Thing of any Bond being brought into the Bank when Mr Waite was not in the Office ? Collyer . I can not say that I do . ( The Receipt was shewn to him ) I own this to be my Hand writing , it was brought to me by Mr Standish , who was an entering Clerk . Mr Standish . I received these Bonds in Mr Waite 's Absence and entered them , Mr Collyer sign 'd the Receipt , [ The Act of Parliament directs the Receipt should be signed by a Cashier ] and when Mr Waite came back I delivered them into his Hands - It might be 2 or 3 Hours after I received them - I gave them to Mr Waite and he locked them up in his Desk - it was his own Desk ; we have each of us a Desk to lock up every Thing we have in Trust - No Body had the Key of that Desk but himself . - These Bonds should regularly have been carried down into a Vault . The Directors have the Keys of the Vault ; Mr Waite had only the Keys of a particular Chest . - I never went down with the Directors , and do not know whether one , two , or three go down . Mr Collyer 's Receipt read , signed James Collyer , dated April 7 , 1741 , wherein he acknowledged to have received of the Defendant , Jacob Harvey , by an Order of the 18th of March last , 20 East-India Bonds , in the Cause of Wheeler and Harvey . Among which , were No . 9671 , No . 2311 , and No . 33335. John Waite . Mr Standish , I desire to know whether or not , when you delivered those 20 Bonds to me , you saw me lock them up in my Desk ? Standish . I saw you put them in , and the Key turn ; I think that is locking them up . Waite You might see me put them in , and not see me lock them up . King 's Counc . Having proved the Bonds to come into his Care , we shall now proceed to prove his Disposal of them . ( Richard Willoughby sworn . ) King 's Counc . Mr Willoughby , do you know the Prisoner ? Richard Willoughby . I have known the Prisoner 7 or 8 Years ; I have done Business for him as a Broker . Counc . Look into any Minute or Memorandum you have , and see whether you ever received any East-India Bonds from him ; what the Numbers were ; what Directions he gave you , and what you did with them ? Richard Willoughby . On the 27th of April 1741 , he gave me six India Bonds to sell , Letter A . 2336 , Letter A 2337 , Letter A . 2740 , No . 9671 , No . 20311 , No . 23335 . Counc . What were you to do with them ? Richard Willoughby . I was to sell them - for himself - and I did dispose of them accordingly - they carried a Premium of 4 l. 11 s. - 628 l. 12 s. and 7 d. was the neat Produce of them . - I delivered the Money to Mr Waite the same Day . Coun . Whose Bonds did you understand them to be ? Richard Willoughby . His own Bonds ; we always suppose them to be the Property of the Person that brings them . Counc . What Name were they made out in ? Richard Willoughby . They were made out in the Name of Webb , that is the Name they are all made out in . - I can not say that I know the Dates of them . William Webb . I am an Officer of the East-India Company . - I am the Person in whose Name the Bonds are made out , and do indorse them - These are India Bonds - this is my Endorsement - they have all my Name on the Back - there are no other Bonds of the same Numbers and Dates . Counc . At the Time of making out these Bonds , were they all made payable to you ? Webb . Yes , they were all made out in my Name , and I endorsed them . Counc . They are , by Act of Parliament , transferable by Endorsement . The Bonds were produced and read , viz . No . A . 2336 , - Dated June 27 , 1737 . No . A . 2337 . - Dated June 27 , 1737 . [ No . A . 2740 . - was not produced . ] No . 9671 . - Dated October 25 , 1736 . No . 20311 . - Dated February 18 , 1736 . No . 23335 . - Dated March 17 , 1736. with the Seal off . Q . How came that Bond to be cancelled ? Mr. Robins . It is a satisfied Bond - it was exchanged for another - it was brought in to be exchanged October 31 , 1741 , by Mr. Nathaniel Newnhman . ( Mr Standish called again . ) Counc . Did any Body live in the Bank at the Time Mr. Waite went away ? Standish . Yes ; Zerubbabel Crouch , the Accomptant General of the Bank , lived there - he lay there himself , and his Wife and Maid-Servant . - Mr. Robert Sayer , a Clerk in the Bank , lived there at the same Time . - The Porter and his Wife have an Apartment there . - I am positive Mr. Crouch was alive when Mr Waite went away . King 's Counc . There is another Thing we are ready to prove , that as the Bank is obliged to make good these Bonds , that they have bought others and replaced them . The Order of the Court of Chancery of the 10th of July 1741 , was read ; whereby the Bonds deficient in the Cause of Draper against Pit , Boswell against Smiter , & c. to the Amount of 133 were ordered to be replaced by the Bank . Mr. Pyle , an Officer of the Report-Office , produced the Certificates , whereby it appeared that the Bank had replaced them . Council for the Prisoner . My Lord , as to Matters of Fact , I am under very great Restrictions , and that is the Misfortune of the Prisoner . He is only assisted , if Matter of Law arise in this Case , and then we are only at Liberty to speak for him , as to that . I submit it upon the Prosecutors own Evidence , whether upon the Circumstances they have proved , he is guilty of the Crime laid to his Charge . I shall not endeavour to state any Thing contrary to the Facts ; and considering the Evidence in the strongest Sense , the single Question is , whether this Taking of his does amount to a felonious Taking or not . I will not dispute that the Bank has a special Property , and may bring an Action of Trover , and lay an Indictment for it : And I would not have this forgot , and I believe the Witnesses will not deny it , that as the Prisoner is a Proprietor in the Bank , he may have a special Interest in this Corporation ; these Bonds may be the Property of the Bank , but the Question is , whether he , as a Proprietor of Bank-Stock , has not a Right with the rest of the Company ; and whether a Man , even in that Respect , can be indicted for stealing Goods in which he has a Property ; that will be one Thing to be considered in this Man 's Defence , and I could even submit it upon the Circumstances of that single Point , whether this does amount to a felonious Taking . I will not state the whole Facts , because I know I am not allowed to do it , and therefore I will state it upon their own Evidence ; and I beg leave to say , that the Prisoner has been entrusted with these Bonds , that he has had these Bonds delivered to him , and has given Receipts for them in his own Name ; therefore I submit it , whether , under these Circumstances , he ought to be indicted for a felonious Taking of these very Bonds which were so delivered to him , tho ' I do not doubt but he did dispose of them against his Trust , this Man being under Misfortunes at that Time , tho ' they were not publickly known ; but I apprehend the disposing of them will never make him guilty of Felony , unless the taking them was Felony . Court . We shall leave that to the Jury , whether it was with a felonious Intent that he took them away . 2d Counc . I submit it to your Lordship , whether they have gone far enough in a Case of this Nature . They have laid the Bonds as the Property of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , and have described the Money to be due to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , and unsatisfied to them ; and as to the second Count , they say , if we have not been right in laying them to be the Property of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , we have laid them to be the Property of a Person unknown ; and not any one of the Witnesses they have produced has shown , that the Governor or Company of the Bank of England , have any Right to this Money at all ; and according to the laying of this Count in the Indictment , they should have shewn the Money to be due to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England ; or according to the second Count , that the Bonds were the Property of a Person unknown . I must submit it to your Lordship , that they have failed in proving either Count , so as to affect the Prisoner ; for if , as they have proved the Governor and Company of the Bank had a Property , then these Bonds were not the Property of Persons unknown ; and if the Governor and Company of the Bank could not receive the Money for them ( being a Deposit only ) then the Money can not be due to them , as is set out in the Indictment . King 's Counc . You mistake it , in the third Count it is , was due and unsatisfied to the several Proprietors thereof ; in the fourth Count it is laid to be the Property of a Person unknown , and remains due and unsatisfied to the said Person unknown . Mr Serjeant Wynne says right , that it will maintain an Action of Trover , or support an Indictment ; the Bank were answerable , and we have proved they were answerable . 2d King 's Counc . Take this one Way or the other , it incontestably hits him : First , they are laid to be the Property of the Bank of England ; secondly , the Property of a Person unknown . Now take it upon the first , it can not be disputed but that the Bank has a special Property : In the Case of a Bailment of Goods and Pledges , the special Property is in the Bail , in whom the Property is placed . Wilbraham and Snow , 2 Saunders 47 . A Carrier can bring an Action . They must either be the Property of those who were originally entitled to them , or the Property of other Persons : One of the Witnesses says , there was a Dispute between the Parties who had the Property in the Bonds , and this shows them plainly to be the Property of Persons unknown . ( Part of the Indictment read ) `` Was the Property of the Governor and Company `` of the Bank of England , and was then due `` and unsatisfied to the Proprietors thereof . '' Pris . Counc . Mr Bootle says , if they do not belong to the one they do to the other , that is very true ; but they have fixed the Property in the Bank of England , and therefore their being the Property of a Person unknown , is quite out of the Case ; therefore they must make it out that the Governor and Company of the Bank of England may receive the Money : It will be admitted that they had a special Property , so far as to have the Custody of the Bonds , but not such a Property as to receive the Money , or that the Money was due and owing to them . They have laid this Money to be the Money of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England ; they might safely have said the Money was unsatisfied , but it was not the Money of the Bank of England . The Gentlemen of the other Side say , that the Bank has made it good ; but I apprehend what the Bank has done , was upon a Time subsequent to the Fact , and this should have been at the Time of the taking away , therefore I think this does not support the Indictment . Then , as to the second Count , it says the Property of a Person unknown . King 's Counc . It says each of the Bonds is the Property of a Person unknown . Court . I think this is the Description of the Bonds ; it says the Bonds were the Property of the Bank of England , and that the Bonds were then due and unsatisfied to the Bank , and the Proprietors thereof . Pris . Coun . It is due and owing to the Proprietors thereof . Q . Who is entitled to receive the Money due upon these Bonds ; may not the Person who has the Custody and Possession of them receive it ? King 's Counc . They are endorsed to the Bank . Court . If you will but look at them , you will see they are endorsed Blank . Pris . Counc . Whoever had the lawful Possession of these Bonds , can not be guilty of Felony . Court . I may have the lawful Possession of a Thing , and yet be guilty of Felony . King 's Council ( to the Prisoner 's Council . ) If you will argue the Point of Law , go on , or else examine your Witnesses . Pris . Couns . We want to examine your 's . Mr. Collyer called . Pris . Counc . Give an Account to my Lord and the Jury , when these Bonds were delivered to Mr Waite , which were brought to the Bank in his Absence ? Collyer . I can give no Account of it at all , till I turn to the Receipt . I believe they were delivered to him that Day . This is my Hand-writing ; the Bonds were delivered to the Prisoner , the 7th of April , 1741 . - They were the Bonds in the Cause of Wheeler against Harvey . These are Part of those twenty Bonds . Pris . Council to Standish . Do n't you know that Mr. Waite is a Proprietor of Bank-Stock . Standish . I believe he has been possessed of Bank-Stock - I can not swear whether he is now or not . * * The Prisoner had been possessed of 1000 l. Bank-Stock , which he transferred as Part of his Security ; but this did not appear in Evidence . Pris . Counc . We can not get at the Bank Books to prove this . King 's Counc . He has no Bank-Stock . The Prisoner 's two Receipts are dated , one on the 23d of July , 1737 , the other , on the 22d of December , 1740 , and the other Bonds , for which Collyer gave a Receipt , came to his Hand the 7th of April 1741 , and they were sold the 27th of the same Month by his Order ; and therefore I submit it to your Lordship whether this was a felonious taking or not . Pris . Counc . My Lord , before the Act of Parliament of the second of George II . c. 25 , the stealing and carrying away Bonds and other Securities ( or Choses in Action , as they were then called ) could not be Felony ; but by that Act of Parliament it is made Felony . As it is agreed that the making this Felony , is founded on this Act of Parliament , I desire it may be read , and then I will submit it to your Lordship , that this is not a felonious taking , as the Circumstances will be made out . The Clause read. `` And be it further enacted , by the Authority aforesaid , That if any Person or Persons , after the said 29th of June , shall steal , or take by Robbery , any Exchequer Orders , & c. East-India-Bonds , & c. being the Property of any other Person or Persons , or of any Corporation , notwithstanding any of the said Particulars are termed , in Law , a Chose in Action , it shall be deemed and construed to be Felony , of the same Nature , and in the same Degree , and with or without the Benefit of Clergy , in the same Manner as it would have been if the Offender had stolen , or taken by Robbery , any other Goods of like Value with the Monies due on such Orders , & c. '' Pris . Counc . My Lord , I shall trouble your Lordship with a Word or two upon this Head ; and I believe , upon the Circumstances of the Case , this will not appear to be a felonious taking ; the Words have been read to your Lordship , that such Persons who shall steal or take , by Robbery , any Bonds , Orders , & c. shall be guilty of Felony , as if such Offender had stole Money or Goods : It was admitted , on the other Side , that this was not Felony by the Common Law ; ( the stealing of Bonds , Warrants , & c. ) and he was pleased to give a very good Reason for it , that these Securities were not so common , or numerous as they are now ; and therefore the Case of Property being very much altered , there was a Necessity of altering the Law , and , I believe , the Act of Parliament takes Notice of it fully : It is not a declaratory Act of Parliament , but introductive of a new Law , and the Question is , whether they have offered your Lordship any Evidence to bring this Case within the present Act of Parliament : By this Act of Parliament , it must be an actual stealing or taking by Robbery : What Evidence has been offered to your Lordship , to shew that there has been any stealing , or taking by Robbery ? they are Terms extremely well understood in Point of Law ; if they are taken by the Person who has the Possession , ( that is a right Possession ) if it is by the Privity or Consent of the Owner , or by an actual Delivery to the Person , by him or his Order , that can not make it to be a felonious taking ; the Intention of the Statute is only to make Choses in Action , and which are Part of a Man 's Property secure ; that seems to be the Intention of the last Act of Parliament , that the taking of these should be punished in the same Degree and Manner , as if a Person had taken Goods or Money to the same Value . But the Law makes no Difference in these , it intends no Alteration at all , either in the Nature of the Crime , or the Consequences of it . My Lord , I take the Thing to be pretty clear , that where a Thing is delivered to a Person ; where it is entrusted with him , and put into his Possession and Custody , I think that can not be Felony ; though the Party does unhappily abuse his Trust , that will not make it Felony , it will not alter the Original Trust so as to make it Felony ; and I believe there are many Authorities which may be mentioned to prove this , 1 Hale 667 . The Gentlemen say , it is very clear that he sold them , and converted the Produce to his own Use : It was urged that the strongest Argument of his Guilt was , his flying and running away with the Money ; an honest Man is sometimes forced to go out of the Way for Debt ; but this does not infer the Crime of Felony ; and I will suppose , for Argument Sake , that the Prisoner has converted this Money to his own Use , and , if so , it is certainly a Misdemeanor , and a Breach of Trust , for which he must be answerable another Way : Aand in Answer to such a general Argument as was made Use of in the out-set ; I must say , that any Man that designs a Felony does not use to give Receipts , but he gave Receipts under his own Hand to shew the Delivery of these Things , and his receiving them : And , as I have mentioned Possession in general , I may further add , where a Man is intrusted with Goods , and has the Possession of them , for a particular Purpose , that Man can not be guilty of Felony . Hawkins 89 . If a Man has Possession of any Goods , by Delivery , he can not commit a Felony ; as with Respect to the Case of a Carrier that goes away with Goods which were put into his Hands to deliver to another . Hale 's Abrigdment 61 . Hist . Pleas of the Crown , 506 . Hawkins 89 . If the Carrier goes away with these Goods , carries them to a wrong Place , by which they are lost , or sells them , it has been determined over and over again , that this is not Felony . One of the Gentlemen made use of an Expression , that the Prisoner separated the Bonds , that he had Possession of them , and took them out of a greater Number ; that he embezzled them and applied them to his own Use . I do allow there is a Distinction in this , for if a Carrier breaks open a Pack , or a Chest , or a Trunk , and sells Part of the Goods , the Carrier then may be said to be guilty of Felony . If a Man delivers or lends an Horse to another , and he rides away with it , this Person is not guilty of Felony : This is a common Case in all the Books , and I rely strongly upon it . I have known the Case tried here . Suppose a Man comes to an Inn-keeper under Pretence of chaffering for a Horse , and when he has got upon his Back , rides away with it ; this is not Felony . 1 Hale 504 . But there is a Distinction in the Statute , where a Servant takes a Horse , without the Leave of his Master , and rides away with it , that is Felony by the Statute of Henry VIII . I might trouble your Lordship with a great many more Cases , but I will leave it upon this ; here are a great many Bonds delivered to and entrusted with an Officer of the Bank , and he sells them , & c. I submit it to your Lordship , that from the Authority of the Officer , it is not a felonious taking . I am not contending that a Man is not answerable another Way ; but the Question is , whether the Law will support a Prosecution for a Felony . As to Mr Waite 's being guilty of a Misapplication of the Money , to be sure he is , but that such Misapplication does not amount to a Felony ; I am confirmed in it , by an Act of Parliament made very lately , to prevent Accidents of this Kind for the future ; and I believe , the Gentlemen will find no Retrospection in the Act ; it is the Act of the 15th Year of his present Majesty c. 15 , p. 538 . This Act of Parliament says , `` If any Officer , or Servant of the said Company , ( meaning the Bank of England ) being intrusted with any Note , Bill , Dividend - Warrant , Bond , Deed , or any Security , & c. Money , or other Effects , belonging to the said Company , or having any Bill , Dividend-Warrant , Bond , Deed , or any Security , or Effects of any other Person or Persons , lodged or deposited with the said Company , or with him , as an Officer or Servant of the said Company , shall secrete , embezzle , or run away with any such Note , Bill , Dividend Warrant , Bond , Deed , Security , Money , or Effects , or any Part of them , every Officer or Servant so offending , and being thereof convicted in due Form of Law , shall be deemed guilty of Felony , and shall suffer Death as a Felon , without Benefit of Clergy . '' I apprehend this Clause shews the Sense of this Body , the Sense of the honourable Persons who advised them in this Case , and the Sense of the Legislature , that this was not Felony before ; for they will find that this is not a declaratory Act , ( there being no declaratory Words , ) but is plainly introductive of a new Law . I am far from thinking that such a wise Body , as the Legislature is , would make a vain , or a needless Act ; for if this was Felony before , what Occasion was there to make it Felony ? I hope this Act of Parliament , which is a publick one , will not be looked upon as a nugatory Act , but have its full Weight in Favour of the Prisoner , and that a Jury of Englishmen will regard it as such . 2d Coun . The Question is , Whether this is a Breach of Trust , or a Felony ? I shall not dispute with the Gentlemen of the other Side , but that there is a special Property in the Bank , and the Gentlemen might have brought an Action against the Prisoner , and may yet do it ; and I hope if they can have a Remedy in a Civil Way they will never succeed in a criminal one . I apprehend the taking of these Bonds is no Felony at all ; but if it is so , it is a Felony by the Act of Parliament of the 15th of his present Majesty ; It is said , If this is not Felony , what is Felony ? The Case of a Carrier has been mentioned , but I apprehend that is not applicable to the present Case . A Carrier had Goods delivered to him to carry to a particular Place , he carried them and delivered them at that particular Place , and then takes them away , that I agree is Felony ; for when he had delivered them at that particular Place , his Trust determined , he had divested himself of that Property he had in them , and when he took them away , then the Felony commenced , then was the unjust taking , for there must be an unjust taking to make it stealing : But it is not thus in the present Case , for as the Bonds always remained with the Prisoner , the Question will be , Whether he can be guilty of stealing these Bonds from himself , and I apprehend no Man can be guilty of stealing from himself what he has in his Possession . My Lord , it is said , by the Council for the King , that there was a special Property in these Bonds in the Bank of England , but in Respect to this , I would mention the Act of Parliament of the 12th of George I. for by that Act the Bank is only entitled to the Receipt of the Interest , the Money was not due to them , but the Suitors , and therefore the taking can not be Felony in this Case . In the Act of Parliament of his present Majesty , it is indeed declared , If any Person belonging to the Bank does secrete , or embezzle any Thing belonging to them , that Person shall be guilty of Felony : But this Act of Parliament was made after this Offence was committed , and therefore does not reach the Crime this Man is charged with ; and therefore , I hope , upon the Circumstances of the Case , this Man does not appear to have acted any otherwise than in Breach of his Trust . 3d Council observed , among other Things , that if the Prisoner had been intrusted with these Securities , without giving any Receipt for them , there might have been a Difference in the Case ; but here Mr. Waite had 'em by a Sort of a Contract , for she gave a Receipt for them , which proves he came not by them tortiously , or that he robbed the Bank of them ; for having them thus in his Custody , he made himself a Trustee to the Company , and was answerable for the Value of them ; and the Bank is not destitute of a Remedy in this Case , inasmuch as they take Security of their Officers , and I submit it to the Court , that the Act of Parliament of the 15th of George II . was not a declaratory Act , or explanatory of any other Act of Parliament , but a new Law , and that the Offence charged upon the Prisoner was not Felony by any former Law . 4th Counc . My Lord , I will leave the Facts as they now stand , and not trouble the Court with any thing in Relation to the Nature of the Evidence , but consine myself merely to Matters of Law , and make a Parallel between this and other adjudged Cases , from Time to Time , and show that there 's no Reason to distinguish this from any of those Cases . Before the Statute-Law , stealing a meer Chose in Active , could not be Felony ; therefore it was thought necessary to make the Breach of that great Trust , which is reposed in the People of the Bank , Felony , because if they thought themselves at Liberty to play Tricks of this Kind , and not be punished for them , it would be of the last Consequence to the Publick . The Words of that Act of Parliament are plain enough to me to show that this Offence is not in any former Act : For the Act says , `` If any Person shall steal or take by Robbery ; '' stealing is a transferring the Possession , and that privately from a Person ; taking by Robbery , implies a Force , for there can not be a Robbery without an actual Force ; there can not be a Robbery in this Case , if it is any Thing it must be a stealing . Could he take these Things without the Consent of the Persons who put them into his Hand ? Has not he a Property ? Had the Governor and Company embezzled these Things , Could they be guilty of Felony ? No , they could not , but they are liable to make Satisfaction to the Suitors in Chancery : What Right is there to distinguish Persons ? They have entrusted him as their Servant ; he is as much entrusted by them , as the Court of Chancery entrusted the Bank ; and he , by his Receipt , is liable and answerable . Put the case , that the Bank had a Mind to make a little Use of a Parcel of inconsiderable Papers for a little Time , though I do not suppose they would . What would have been the Consequence , it would not be Felony ? King 's Counc . They can not commit a Felony , for they are a Corporation . 4th Counc . I know a Body-Corporate can not commit a Felony , but each of them separately may be guilty of Felony . Now I beg leave to consider how it may be distinguished in Point of Law , for Waite had a special Property in these Bonds . If I lend my Watch , or my Horse to a Person , and he goes to Market and sells them , this is not Felony , this supposes a Contract , and gives the Party a Remedy at common Law ; besides they have Security for his good Behaviour ; all the Officers of the Bank gave Security , and as to the Property there should be a Distinction made in this Respect , for there may be a Property for a particular Purpose ; and when a Person has Possession of a Thing lawfully , there an Action of Trover only lies against the Person . If a Carrier is robbed , he may maintain a Prosecution , because he has a special Property for a particular Purpose . A Man that comes legally by a Thing , can not rob himself ; for if he had a Right to the Possession , he must have stole them from himself , he could not have stole them from any Body else . Then as to the late Act of Parliament , my Lord , for what End and Purpose could this Act of Parliament be made , if it was not the Sense of the Legislature , that the stealing of these Securities was not Felony before ; but the Reason , as I apprehend , was , and in Point of Law , must be taken to be so , that the stealing of Choses in Action , was not Felony before . Suppose he forgot or mislaid a Bond , and could not find it , must he be indicted for a Felony . I very well remember a remarkable Case * , ( that went out of this Court upon a special Verdict , whether the stealing of Chancery-Records , taking them out of the Office , and taking the Stamps off , and selling them , was Felony ; but the Court of King 's Bench gave their Opinion upon it , that it was not Felony , and the Party was acquitted , and it was the Voice of the whole Court , that it was not Felony . But this new Act being made , plainly shows that Mr Waite is not guilty of Felony , as it was not Felony before this Act . But should we be so unfortunate as not to satisfy the Court and the Jury , that this is not Felony , then I should be glad if the Court would be pleased to indulge us in such a Manner , that the Facts may be stated , in order that the several Points may be more fully argued ; and that we may have Time to lay Reasons before the Judges , which , in this material Case , ought to be very maturely considered , and that it may not be left to a Jury , to determine Quo animo he took them . * In the Mayoralty of Mr Alderman Perry . See the Trial , January Sessions , No . 124 . Serj . Agar . It is , my Lord , admitted by us all , that the Bank had so far a special Property in the Bonds , as to receive the Interest , but not otherwise . King 's Council . My Lord , I beg a few Words by Way of Reply , in Behalf of the Prosecution ; but before I argue the Points of Law , it will be proper to see upon what Ground we stand , in Point of Evidence . By the Act of Parliament , these Bonds are to be carried to the Bank , to be received by the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , and Receipts are to be given for them ; and the Act of Parliament makes the Bank of England expressly liable for the same . According to the Evidence , these Bonds were carried from the Court of Chancery to the Bank , and as the Bank have proper Servants for every Branch of their Business , the Prisoner at the Bar was the proper Person to receive these Bonds from the Accomptant-General of the Court of Chancery ; and I do lay this as a Foundation , that as soon as they are delivered into the Bank of England , they are that Minute in the Possession of the Bank ; let them remove that Corner-Stone if they can , they are in the Possession of them , whether they are under their own Lock and Key , or the Lock and Key of their Servant , for it is their Possession in Point of Law : The Gentlemen would insinuate , that these Bonds are not to be considered as delivered into the Possession of the Bank , but into the Possession of Mr Waite , for Mr Waite has given Receipts for them , and made himself answerable for them ; but they have omitted the most material Part , that he receives them for , and subscribes the Receipt for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England ; his Receipt is not such a Receipt as will entitle the Suitors to call upon him for the Money , not such a Receipt as will entitle him to it ; for though this Man 's Name is to the Receipt , it is in Point of Law the Receipt of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England . If a Servant gives a Receipt , and says , for my Master such an one , Is not this , in Point of Law , the Receipt of the Master ? Because this Money is received by the Servant , is it not the Receipt of the Master ? It is as much mine as it I had signed it . They would turn us round , and tell us we are to bring an Action , and make this a Breach of Trust : I should be glad to know whose Trust it is that he has broke : Would they say he has broke his Trust with the Court of Chancery , they can not say he has broke his Trust with them . - They have brought it out , but not as a Point of Law , that a Man can not steal from himself ; no more he can abstractedly , but he may commit a Felony of what he has in his own Possession ; and I will make it out very plain from the first Case put by Mr Serjeant Wynne , Hale 506 , in the Case of a Carrier , says , that if a Man delivers Goods to a Carrier , to carry to Dover , and he carried them away , 't is no Felony . But if a Carrier , after he has carried Goods to the Place appointed , secretly takes them away again , Animo Surandi , in such Case the Possession which he received from the Owner being determined , his second taking , is in all Respects , the same as if he was a Stranger . I will put a middle Case : If a Carrier , in his Journey between London and York , will unpack Goods , and take any thing out of a Case , Box , or Pack , that will be a felonious Taking ; for he had no Authority at all to separate these Goods , his Authority was to receive the Bundle entire , and to deliver it entire at such a Place . Let us compare the Cases : here are twenty Bonds delivered at one Time into the Hand of this Man , and three of these are taken by him for his own Use , he is in the same Case with the Carrier who takes part of the Goods out of a Parcel , and does not deliver them to the Party they are for , but disposes of them , and applies the Money to his own Use ; the Question is , whether this is not Evidence to a Jury of a felonious Taking . The next Case they mention , is that of lending a Horse ; that if a Man lends a Horse to another , and he rides away with it , it is not Felony . And they have put a Case which they can not make out , that if a Man goes to an Inn to hire a Horse , and gets upon his Back and rides away with it , that is not Felony ; but I believe they can not make a Book-Case of it ; that it is not Felony , for in that Case the Horse is not lent to him , and therefore it must be a Felony . I would not have them run away with this as a Point , but I hope there are no Horse-stealers here , for this is too dangerous a Doctrine to be delivered in this Place . - But the Gentlemen , they say , as to what has been done by Mr Waite , that is not such a Stealing , as comes within the Meaning of the Law ; but as I have proved that those Bonds are in the Possession of the Bank of England , as soon as they are delivered to him , those Persons who make away with them are liable to be punished for a Felony . There is a Difference between having the Care of Goods , and the legal Possession of them ; for when a Man has no more than the Care of Goods , the Possession is all the while , in the Judgment of the Law , in the Master . I will venture to lay it down as a Rule , that that Sort of a Servant may be guilty of Felony in taking those Goods to his own Use . Serjeant Hawkins , in his Pleas of the Crown , p. 90. says it has been received as Law , that those who have the bare Charge of Goods may be guilty of Felony ; that is , when they are entrusted with a Parcel of Goods , the taking out part of them is Felony ; and one who has the bare Charge of Goods , or the special Use of Goods , and not the Possession , that is a legal Possession , he may be guilty of Felony . The first Case he puts , is the Case of a Gentleman 's Butler ; every Gentleman , I believe , does not lock up his own Plate , or keep it in his own Custody , and when a Butler is hired , there is nothing more known , than that an Account of the Plate is taken in Writing and delivered to the Butler , and the Plate is delivered into his Care , he has the cleaning of it , and is the proper Person to take Care of it ; and he has it by that Delivery , if I may so say , intrusted into his Hand ; it is a determined Point , that by being in my House ( in Point of Law ) it is in my Possession , and if my Butler will take a Piece of my Plate and sell it and put the Money into his Pocket , he is Guilty of Felony . 1 Hale , 506 . Dyer , fol . 5 . It is determined there , that if a Butler disposes of a Piece of my Plate , he is Guilty of Felony , and must suffer Death , if it is to the Value of 40 s. - Now as to this Sort of Bonds , I find they remain in the Custody of the Person who has the Care of them , till the Directors go down to put them into the Vault , and then he that had the Care of them , goes down to the proper Place to lock them up , in the Sight of the Directors : This is not like a Case where Goods are delivered to a Man to keep in his Custody , I take the Case of the Butler to be stronger than the present Case , for there he has the Plate by the express Act of the Master delivered to him ; and when he goes away , the Plate is counted over and delivered back . The next Case is that of a Shepherd , who is employed by a Farmer to take Care of his Sheep . There was a Notion that the Shepherd was so entrusted with the Sheep , that if he run away with them , he could not be prosecuted for a Felony . See Hawkins , and Hale 's Pleas of the Crown , 506 . A Shepherd , by disposing of one Sheep is guilty of Felony ; for he has only the Care of them ; he is not generally entrusted with them , the Law distinguishes between having Possession of a thing , and only having the Care of it . There is another Case put of a Servant who has the Key of an Appartment delivered to him , that he may be Guilty of Felony , if he takes any Thing out of it ; for tho ' he has the Key of the Chamber , the Goods are still in the Possession of the true Owner . Then there is another Case put ; if a Man goes into a Tavern as a Guest , and has a Piece of Plate set before him , not with standing he has Possession of this by my Delivery ; if he walks off with it , he must walk to Tyburn , or else be carried thither ; for it is only delivered to him to use , it is not a Delivery of Possession . There is another Case put by my Lord Hale , fol . 506 , if an Apprentice embezzles his Master 's Goods or Money , out of his Shop , it is there determined to be Felony ; if I go abroad , and leave my Shop of Goods in the actual Possession of my Servant or Journeyman , to dispose of while I am gone , and he makes away with any Part of it , it is Felony ; for not with standing his Possession , the legal Possession is in me ; and there is a Rule in Law , which I will put the Gentlemen in Mind of , that tho ' there may be a Sort of a mixed Possession , the Law always supposes the true Possession to be in him who is the Master , and he is judged to be really in Possession . And since they are praying Aid of this Act of Parliament which makes this Felony , which was not Felony before , and that as the Act does not make Use of any declaratory Words ; they conclude , that Persons who committed such Facts before , were not Guilty of Felony - I do agree , that there are no Recitals of other Acts , and no retrospect Words , and therefore they conclude , this Act must only be designed as a Punishment for Facts committed , subsequent to the making of this Act ; and the Gentlemen would insinuate , that this Man was in the entire Possession of these Bonds , and that by disposing of these Bonds he has made a Breach of that Trust which they had reposed in him : If , I say to a Person , Sir , take Care of these Bonds for me , till I come to Town , and he misapplies these Bonds , that is a Breach of Trust . Now the Act says , any Officer being entrusted , & c. But this Man had not that Sort of Trust , and the Act would have been very improperly made , to have had declaratory Words in that Instance . It is very well known , we have a Number of Statutes , which are made to put an End to Differences which were quite unnecessary : And , I will put the Gentlemen in Mind of a Statute , which they hear of almost every Session at the Old Bailey , that is , the Statute of Stabbing ; does any Body consider that as a New Law ? And , I will submit it to your Lordship , whether there is any Doubt , but that that Act runs as this does . ( Be it enacted . ) There was one Thing more said , by the Gentlemen of the other Side , if this is a doubtful Case , if there are any Difficulties in Point of Law in relation to it , in Favour of Life , say the Gentlemen , we hope the Court will not hastily determine a Point of this Consequence . My Lord , I am very ready , where the Court has any reasonable Doubt , to refer any thing of this Nature ; but I can not see , how they can make a Special Verdict of it , for there must be Facts found by the Jury ; and if the Jury say , he did take them with a felonious Intent , there can not be a Special Verdict , if they say he did not take them with a felonious Intent , there is an End of the Case ; I can not see how it can be any otherwise , than by the Direction of the Court to the Jury . I am sure , in the Case of a Man 's Life , I would not strain any Point of Law , and , I am sure , my Clients would not desire it ; but when you come to consider the Case of the Butler as having the Plate , and the Case of the Shepherd as having the Sheep in their Custody only for Care : These Cases seem to be such Authorities , that we have Reason to expect , your Lordship 's Direction to the Jury after summing up of the Evidence , that this is Felony in Point of Law . 2d King 's Counc . My Lord , I hope to be admitted to speak a few Words on the same Side ; and as those four Gentlemen have so elaborately handled this Point , I would willingly make some Observations upon the Case ; and I think , according to the Argument of those Gentlemen , the whole Question amounts to this , Whether as Mr Waite had those Bonds delivered to him , by the Court of Chancery , and did not come by them by any fraudulent Means , this can be any more than a Breach of Trust , and that to make this Felony will be going beyond what bath ever been known to be adjudged Felony , and they have stated several Cases to shew that this can not be Felony ; and now , my Lord , to turn to that which I think has been inconteleably proved , I submit it to your Lordship , Whether upon the whole Scope of the Evidence , the Case does not appear to be this and no otherwise , that these Bonds were legally , properly , and in Point of Fact in the Possession of the Bank , and that Mr Waite , though he was the Hand that received them . though he was the Hand that went to receive the Interest upon them , was still acting only under that Possession , in like Manner as every Person , who has the Care of Things , which are in the Possession of another , may be said to act ; that he gave Receipts for these it is true ; But who was it for ? why , for the Bank of England , and from these Receipts the Possession is fixed directly and absolutely in the Bank : The Law charges the Bank just the same as if they were actually kept in the Hands of the Directors of the Bank ; and the Bank has in Fact , and it is nothing but what is founded upon the Principles of Equity and Justice , made good the Loss , which has arisen by this , to the Proprietors ; therefore considering this in every Light , it can not be taken any otherwise than that this is the Possession of the Bank . How is Mr Waite then to be considered ? Why merely as a Servant who only has the Care of them ; and it was from this that he had an Opportunity of disposing of them ; Then , my Lord , this being laid down , supposing I am right in that , the only Question that does arise upon on this is , Que animo , did this Man take these Bonds ? he took them , gave them to a Broker as his Bonds ; he sells them for him , gave him the Money , and he put it into his Pocket , Quo animo , was this done ? I shall allude to the Case , put by Sir John Strange , the Case of the Butler , which is Law ; my Lord Hale , in his Pleas of the Crown , treats on this Question ; I would not misrepresent the Words , I think they are these , `` He that hath the Care of another 's Goods hath not the Possession of them , and therefore may , by his felonious embezzling of them be guilty of Felony ; as the Buttler , that hath Charge of the Master 's Plate ; the Shepherd , that hath Charge of the Master 's Sheep . 3 Hen . 7 . 126 . 21 H 7 . 15. a. Co. Pl . C. p. 108 . The like Law for him , that takes a Piece of Plate set before him to drink in a Tavern , & c. for he hath only a Liberty to use , not a Possession by Delivery . 13 E . 4.9 . '' And my Lord Hale , so great a Man , lays it down positively as referring to these Authorities : I would consider how this Case stands before your Lordship , with Respect to the Prisoner : If a Butler , by embezzling his Master 's Plate , be guilty of Felony , ( the Plate that he has the Charge of ) how does Mr Waite stand ? Had he any more than the Charge of these Bonds ? If any one of the Bonds reach him , it is the same Thing as if the whole Number were proved upon him : Consider what his Possession was ; it was only their being in his Hand to convey them to the proper Repository , and when they had Occasion to receive the Interest , or the like , he is the Hand to whom these are committed to do this , or that Act relating to them , and I do not apprehend that they are any otherwise under his Care than only for this particular Purpose . A Shepherd can not be said to have the Superintendency of the Flock , but he has a Sort of a Care of it , and if he runs away with any Part of it he will be guilty of Felony . Where does this differ from the present Case , either in one Thing or the other ? Dalton c. 155 . It is likewise taken Notice of by my Lord Hale , with respect to an Apprentice , that if he embezzle his Master 's Goods out of his Shop it is Felony : Why may it not be as well said , that an Apprentice , by having the Key of the Door belonging to the Shop , has Possession of the Goods to dispose of them as he shall think fit ? This is only a Trust reported in him for the Profit of his Master ; Where is the Difference between this Case and the Case of Mr Waite ? My Lord , I beg Leave to mention another Case in my Lord Dyer , Fol . 5 . That if a Master delivers to a Servant 20 s. in Silver to change into Gold ; or Leather to make Shoes , and he runs away with the Gold or the Shoes , it is Felony . I will take this for Argument Sake , that Mr Waite had Possession by the Delivery ; I do not take it as a Fact but only argumentatively ; Suppose these Bonds were incontestably delivered to Mr Waite , and in the Possession of him , and he sells these Bonds and runs away with the Money , where is the Difference between this Case and the Case my Lord Dyer makes use of : Suppose a Servant has 20 s. in Silver deliver 'd him , by the Hand of the Master for a particular Purpose , ( so were these Bonds delivered to Mr Waite for a particular Purpose , not to sell or dispose of ) and the Servant , instead of turning the 20 s. of Silver into Gold , and delivering it back to the Master , he runs away with the Gold ; Where is the Difference between this Case and that of Mr Waite ? I will take it for Argument-Sake , that he had this Possession for the Bank ; but if he sells these , and puts the Money into his Pocket , it is Felony : Where is the Difference between this and the Leather made into Shoes ? The Leather was delivered for that very End and no other : But if he runs away with the Shoes , he is guilty of Felony . They have been pleased to say , that it was with the Consent of the Bank that this Man had these Bonds ; the Bank consented that he should have the Care and Management of them , to receive the Interest , and exchange them , as there should be Occasion ; But was it the Consent of the Bank for him to sell them ? For though he had in the first Instance acquired the Possession of them , and had them in his Power ; yet if that is consined to a particular End and Purpose , and he goes beyond that , there is no Consent in the Bank for any other Purpose . The Gentlemen took Notice that I had some Allusion to this Case , when I said , that where a Person has Goods delivered him for a particular Purpose , as a Carrier or Waggoner , who has Goods delivered him to carry , and he breaks open the Bales , and takes out part of these Goods , ( though the whole were delivered him by the Hand of the Owner ) that is Felony . They took Notice , that in my opening , I did allude to this Fact , so I did , I do not deny it . Here were a great Number of Bonds delivered to this Man , he did not dispose of them all , but some of them . Consider what Difference the Law makes in this : If a Parcel of Goods is delivered to a Person , and he sells part of them , he is guilty of Felony . I do not apprehend , but that the Circumstances make a considerable Difference , and the Matter rests upon the Application , and it is reduceable to this , Quo animo , With what Mind did this Man do this ? Whether he did it with a Design to put the Money into his own Pocket , and if he did , it is the same as if he had gone to the Coffers and took out the Money , and put it into his Pocket . And then they refer to another Act of Parliament , made very lately , and say , that is a very plain Parliamentary Declaration , that no Servant of the Bank , before that Act of Parliament , could be guilty of Felony for stealing Notes or Bonds , & c. and that if it was Felony before , there would have been no Occasion for this Act of Parliament . By a Statute of the 1st of Queen Anne , it is enacted , that whoever steals Goods or Chattels to the Value of forty Shillings , in any Dwelling-House , is guilty of Felony without Benefit of Clergy ; before this Law , it was ( as I think may farm it ) a Clergy Felony ; but this Act which they mention , 15 George II , makes the stealing Bonds , Orders , & c. Felony , whether in a Dwelling-House House or not . It makes Choses in Action stand upon the same Footing as Money or Goods did by other Acts ; and though there was a Provision made against this before , yet it was such a Provision , that if any Person of the Bank stole any Bonds , & c. and it was not in a Dwelling-House , he and the Benefit of the Clergy . However if this can be put in such a Manner as to be serviceable to the Prisoner , God forbid I should be against it . It has sometimes happened , that upon an insufficient Finding , the Prisoner has got off Scot-free , because the Court could give no Judgment upon it . My Lord , all that is to go before the Jury is Quo animo , did this Man take these Bonds , whether it was with a felonious Intent , or was it a Breach of Trust . The Law makes this Distinction , whether it was a Breach of Trust , or a felonious Taking . The Court can not determine this , it is a Fact , and this lies before me Jury . I only mention this that we may not go into any Mistake , so far as that this Man shall not have Justice done him , either to acquit him or to convict him . I am not for having him convicted , if the Law does not convict him ; God forbid I should desire this if the Law deems him innocent . Court . ( to Mr Collyer ) Is there Security given to the Bank ? Collyer . Yes . Court . Is it for any accidental Occurence , or Misfortune , that may happen ; or is it for Fidelity ? Collyer . It is in general for Fidelity . Prisoner 's Counc . It is a general Security . The Court was of Opinion , that it was not Felony , before the late Act of Parliament , 15 George II , but offered a Special Verdict , if the King 's Council desired it : They expressed themselves satisfied with the Opinion of the Court , whereupon the Jury were directed to find the Prisoner not guilty . [ The Court was moved for leave to charge the Prisoner with a Civil Action , which was granted , and he was accordingly charged , at the Suit of the Bank , with a Debt of 13300 l. ] 163 . + Stephen Wright , otherwise Brown , of St. Bartholomew behind the Exchange , was indicted for assaulting John Belchier , Surgeon , in his Dwelling-House , putting him in bodily Fear , and Danger of his Life , and taking from him a Gold Watch , val . 8 l. and six Guineas in Money , the Goods , Chattels , and Money , of the said John Belchier , from the Person , and against the Will of the said John Belchier . Jan. 21 . Wright . My Lord , I think it unnecessary in a Case of the Nature of my Crime , to give the Court any Trouble ; and therefore I plead guilty , and I hope I shall be recommended to his Majesty 's Mercy by the Court and the Jury . [ To which he was answered by the Court , that he had already pleaded , not guilty , but he might withdraw that Plea , and plead guilty ; but informed him , if t here were any favourable Circumstances in his Case , if he pleaded guilty , the Court could not take any Notice of them ; and that the Jury can not report any favourable Circumstances , because the Circumstances do not appear to them : Upon which he agreed to take his Trial . ] Mr. Belchier . On Friday the 21st of January , the Prisoner , who calls himself Stephen Wright , came to my House about seven o'Clock in the Evening , under Pretence of having some Complaint that required my Assistance ; and in a very short Time he told me , that his Business with me was to have my Money ; he held a Pistol to my Breast , and demanded my Money ; I was surprized at that , and told him as he had the Appearance of a Gentleman he might be in Necessity , ( I desired him to take away his Pistol ) and I put my Hand into my Pocket and gave him two Guineas ; he said that would not do for his present Necessities ; I put my Hand into my Pocket again , and gave him three Guineas more , he said that would not do ; and that Life or Death were equal to him , he was in such Circumstances ; I put my Hand into my Pocket again , and pulled out a Guinea more ; he took it , and seeing my Watch he demanded that ; I told him as he had got six Guineas he might be satisfied with that ; but he was not , and took my Watch out of my Pocket . I seeing an Opportunity , rushed upon him , took the Pistol out of his Hand , threw him down , and called my Servants ; and then we took the other Pistol from him , and the Watch out of his Hand ; and then he said he was so much distressed in his Circumstances , that Necessity obliged him to do what he did . Q . This was not the first Time he was with you , tell the Story . Mr Belchier . He was at my House on the Monday , and enquired for me . I was not at Home ; he left Word with my Servant , that he would call the next Evening . Tuesday the 18th , was the first Time I saw him at my House ; he staid then about a Quarter of an Hour , and talked to me about some imaginary Complaints . On Friday the 21st , about two o'Clock , I received a Letter , Stephen Wright , wrote for me that Morning ; wherein he says , he had discovered some other Complaint ; that if I thought proper , I might order him something for it ; that he would come that Evening to my House , and bring five Guineas , which he hoped would satisfy me : When he came , I told him , though he was a Stranger , with Respect to the five Guineas , as he appeared so much like a Gentleman , I did not think he had any Design to impose upon me ; and I told him that his Complaint was only imaginary ; and then he told me that he had no Complaint , but his Business with me was in the Manner as I have related it to your Lordship . Prisoner . Ask Mr. Belchier , whether I held the Pistol to his Breast ? Mr. Belchier . When he pulled the Pistol out of his Pocket , he held it to my Breast , and said , Sir , your Money : I said , Take the Pistol away and you shall have my Money . Robert Corderoy . I heard a Noise in the Parlour , and went in and saw the Prisoner at the Bar down on the Floor , upon his Back , and my Master upon him ; says my Master , He has robb 'd me : I saw my Master 's Watch in his Left-hand , and he dropped the Watch upon the Floor ; I took it off the Ground and laid it upon the Chair , and then I laid hold of the Prisoner and secured him . Prisoner . I think he says , I was down on my Back , and Mr. Belchier on me ; I desire to know how he could see the Watch in my Hand when Mr. Belchier was on me ? Corderoy . Your Hands were spread out . Mr. Belchier . In the Struggle he dropped the Money and the Watch ; it might drop out of his Hand : I picked the six Guineas off the Floor . John Hill . On the 21st of January the Prisoner came to my Master ; I heard a great Noise of smashing of Glasses ; I went into the Parlour to see what was the Matter ; I took hold of the Prisoner 's Right Arm and held him while my Master took the Pistol out of his Pocket ; the other Pistol was taken from him before ; I saw the Watch lying in the Chair when I came into the Room . Prisoner . I have no Friends to call to my Character , but I believe Mr. Belchier may have heard * my Character from some Persons in Town : My Misfortunes were such that I did not care to inform my Friends . Guilty , Death . * Mr. Belchier would have given the Court an Account of what he had heard , in relation to the Prisoner , but was told it could not be admitted as Evidence . 164 . + Samuel Wilson , Gent . was indicted for assaulting James Skerret , Gent . with a certain Sword , of the Value of 2 s. giving him one Mortal Wound upon the Breast Bone , of the Breadth of three Quarters of an Inch , and the Depth of four Inches , of which Wound he instantly died , the 20th of January last . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest , for Manslaughter . Henry Gadsdon . I am Servant at the Tilt-Yard Coffee-House , on the 20th of January in the Morning between Twelve and One , I was almost asleep , but heard the Deceased , Mr. Wilson , and Capt . Mr. Caugh , come in and go into the little Room , I hearing them make a Lumber ( a Noise ) in the Room , I got up , and went in , and saw Capt . Wilson take hold of Capt . Skerret by the Collar of the Coat and throw him down upon the Floor , he got up again , and Mr. Richardson laid hold of the Deceased , and bid him be quite , otherwise he must be obliged to call the Guard , and put them both under Arrest , said Capt . Mr. Caugh , Skerret , If you have a Mind for a Little Diversion , I am your Man ? And then Capt . Mr. Caugh , drew his Sword , I heard Capt . Wilson tell Capt . Mr. Caugh to be quiet , that the Affair was his , and he had nothing to do with it ; then Capt . Mr. Caugh went away , ( that is , retired from the Place ) and , I believe , he put up his Sword . - I heard Wilson and the Deceased say something about To-morrow , but I can not tell the Words : - And I think , I heard Wilson say to Skerret , I am your humble Servant ; afterwards I understood , they were gone into the Street to fight , and then I went to call the Guard , and saw they were parted : I saw Capt . Wilson coming up the Steps into the Room , and a Soldier had hold of the Deceased , and brought him into the Room ; I do not know , but the Deceased might give Capt . Wilson Occasion , by something that he said , to come to him again ; but all on a sudden Capt . Wilson came with his Sword drawn again , and they fell upon one another , and in a Minute 's Time ( the least that could be imagined ) I heard the Deceased say , I have Night . I heard something said of Tomorrow , but I can not tell what . - I believe the Wound was given in the Coffee-House , for he dropped immediately : Capt . Mr. Caugh had his Sword drawn , and , I suppose , endeavoured to part them : - He died at our House . - The first Sword I saw drawn in the House , was Capt . Mr. Caugh 's , it was at the Time that he said , If you have a Mind for a little Diversion , I am your Man ? Capt . Mr. Caugh . I came into the Tilt-Yard Coffee-House , about Four o'Clock in the Afternoon the 10th , Carr , and Innys , & c. were there , and desired I would come up Stairs , which I did ; some time afterwards , came in Mr. Wilson , who heard I was there , and sent up Word , if his Company would be acceptable , he would come up ; I sent Word down , I should be glad of it ; he came in , and Carr went away : We continued there from that Time , till about Ten o'Clock , the Deceased then insisted upon drinking some more , Wilson insisted that we should drink no more ; but would go to the Play . We took Coach , and went , and when we came there the Play was over ; we returned back again , to the Tilt-Yard Coffee-House , went into a small Room , within the Coffee-Room , and called for some Punch ; we were told that Mr. Richardson was there , and enquired for Capt . Wilson , the Prisoner desired leave to introduce him ; then Capt . Skerret , said , d - n him he is a Scrub ; or Words to that Effect ; He shall not come into my Company : Capt . Wilson said , he believed he mistook his Character , upon which they had some peevish Words . Wilson went out , and Skerret told me , I was as had as him ( meaning Richardson ) upon which , I told him , he seemed vastly quarrel some the whole Night , and No-body had given him any Reason ; and that it was a Matter of Indifference to me , whether he came in or not , as I had never seen the Gentleman before ; Skerret 's Answer to me was , d - n your Blood , your are a Rascal ; upon which , I laid my Hand to my Sword , and said , my Station in the Army , would not suffer me to bear such Language . - I can not tell , whether I drew my Sword or no ; and I believe , I said , if Mr. Skerret has a Mind to quarrel with any Body , I am his Man , for he has grossly affronted me : Upon which , the Woman of the House , and one Mr Walker , who was in the Coffee-Room , laid hold of me ; I told them , they might let me go , for I promised them upon my Word and Honour , I would have no Words with Skerret that Night , we went into the Room again , shook Hands , and were Friends . - This Quarrel , which was the Occasion of his Death , was immediately afterwards ; ( he was going to quarrel with me again , but I would not ) the Deceased turned about to Wilson , what he said to him , I can not tell ; I saw them both bounce up all on a sudden , and go into the Coffee-Room , who went out first , I can not tell ; Mr. Walker and I continued sitting by the Fire : I saw Mr. Richardson follow them , heard him call the Guard , I told Mr. Walker , should not follow them , for fear I should fall into the Quarrel myself . - I did not see what happened in the Street ; when they returned , I saw Wilson glance by the Door of the little Room which I was in , and saw some Blood upon his Shirt , I started up , and went to the Door of the Room , and immediately saw Skerret break loose from two Soldiers of the Guard , who had hold of him in the Coffee Room ; after Skerret had broke loose from the Soldiers , Wilson met him half Way , in the Centre of the Coffee-Room , and they began to attack one another afresh , and fell to pushing ; I drew my Sword , and beat down their Passes , and told them , they were both under Arrest . - There were a good many Passes ; I beat them down as fast as I could . - The Deceased had a Wound in his Breast , pointing a little towards the Right-Side ; he said , he had got enough for this Night , dropped down , and died on the Spot . - From the first to the last of this Quarrel , it was not above a Quarter of an Hour . Q . ( To Gadsdon ) Was , not the Deceased very drunk , before the Quarrel began ? Gadsdon . They were all in Liquor . Q. I ask you whether he was not so much in Liquor that he was not able to stand , when he went to make Water some Time before that ? Gadsdon . He was very much in Liquor , but not so much in Liquor , but that he was able to stand . - I took him to be the worst in the Company . Q . Do you know this Sword ? Gadsdon . I think Capt . Mr. Caugh gave me this Sword , and bid me take care of it . - This is the Deceased 's Sword ; it lay naked in the Room , after the Deceased was dead ; it was bent at the Point . [ The Sword was bent about six or seven Inches towards the Point . ] Q . ( to Capt . Mr. Caugh ) Did not the Prisoner draw his Sword first upon Capt . Skerret ? Capt . Mr. Caugh . I am not certain who drew first . Q . Could the Wound the Deceased received in his Breast be given , if he had been in a Posture of Defence ? Capt . Mr. Caugh . I do not know , - the Wound might be received when he was off his Guard . Prisoner to Gadsdon . Did not you see the Deceased seize upon me first ? Gadsdon . Really I can not say whether he did or not . - Skerret 's Sword was draw g before Wilson 's . Q . Was Skerret 's Sword drawn at the Time that Richardson laid hold of Skerret the bid him be quiet ? Gadsdon . The Sword was first drawn by Skerret , at the Time Capt . Mr. Caugh said , If you have a Mind for a little Diversion , I am your Man ; that was at the Time Richardson had hold of him , as near as I can guess . Capt . Richardson ( confirmed the other Evidence , with Respect to the reconciling the first Difference ) . As we were sitting together in the little Room , I heard Capt . Skerret make use of the Word dare ; and all on a sudden , he and Capt . Wilson jumped off their Seats , and rushed out of the little Room into the Coffee-Room . I went out after them , and saw Skerret in a rising Posture . I took hold of his Sword which was drawn in his Hand , and in endeavouring to get it from him , I run the Point into the Calf of my Leg , and desired the Servants to call the Guard . Skerret got from me , and rushed towards the Street-Door ; Wilson was then at the Door , and said , stay , or helt . till I have drawn my Sword . I went into the Street , saw three Soldiers , and called to them to part them for fear of Murder . - Skerret 's Sword was drawn at first , but Wilson 's was not . I heard their Swords clash , but the Soldiers parted them . Wilson came in first , then Skerret came in , and the Soldiers had hold of him by the Arm ; and the Soldiers struggled to get the Sword from him , but Skerret got from the Soldiers and advanced towards Wilson ; Wilson was at the other End of the Coffee-Room with his Sword in his Hand ; and then Wilson advanced towards him , and they made several Passes at each other . - I do not know whether the Wound was given in the Street or in the House . Mr. Mackenzie , Surgeon . I was called about one or two in the Morning , about the 20th of January , and when I came into the Coffee-Room , I saw Mr Skerret lying upon the Floor ; he was dead before I I came . I found a Wound in his Breast which was mortal , and was desired by the Coroner the next Day to open the Body ; there were four Wounds in the Trunk of the Body ; one on the right Side , which penetrated into the right Lobe of the Lungs ; there was another on the Breast-Bone , which went through the Sternon ; there was another Wound towards the left Groin , but that did not penetrate , - the Wound went aflant . Mr. Heath , Surgeon . I was sent for to view the Body . I endeavoured to introduce a Probe , which I could not do . I found a Wound upon the Breastbone ; there was one passed between the fourth and fifth Rib on the right Side , penetrating into the right Lobe of the Lungs ; and another a little obliquely into the Sternon , which I apprehend to be the mortal Wound . - I do apprehend he was in a fighting Posture when he received that Wound ; he might receive it when he was recovering from a Lunge ; - there are two Wounds which did not penetrate , and one upon the Leg . Q . How deep was the Wound ? Mr. Heath . It was through the Breast-Bone , a little obliquely into the left Ventricle of the Heart . - He was in a disadvantageous Posture when he received the Wound . - I do not say he was in a Posture of Defence . - The Wound was a little inclining to the Left . - There was a Wound on the left Side of the Navel . - I am not a Judge of Duelling , - but I apprehend that Wound might be received on a Recovery from a Lunge . John Cluer . I was Centinel upon Duty that Night ; West and Wright and I were talking together ; I saw Capt . Skerret come out of the Coffee-house with his Sword drawn , and another Gentlemen followed him , and they fell a pushing ; said I to Wright , They are doing Murder . I laid hold of Capt . Skerret , and Wright of Capt . Wilson ; Wilson went into the Coffee-house , and Skerret swore he would kill me if I did not let him go ; Skerret forced himself from me and made a push at me , and then run into the Coffee-Room , and I followed him ; then they fell to fighting . - I can not say whether Wilson 's Sword was drawn , he was at the farther End of the Room . I did not hear any Words pass but they fell a pushing away ; there were several Passes in the Room , and Skerret dropped his Sword out of his Hand and said , I have enough now ; I will defer it till To-morrow ; and dropped - he slipped gently to the Ground . - The Prisoner did not make any Push after the Deceased 's Sword dropped . Q . Did not the Prisoner say , Now Capt . one more Push for your Honour ? Cluer . I did not hear any such Thing . Richard West confirmed Cluer 's Evidence , and said , that Skerret made a Push with his Sword against the Door , which he believes was the Occasion of its being bent ; that there were three or four Passes , and the Deceased dropped ; that Wilson said , Have you enough ? and the Deceased said , I have enough ; I will defer it till another Day , or another Time . Daniel Wright confirmed Part of the foregoing Evidence , and says the Deceased said , when he came into the Coffee-Room the last Time , He would be revenged , or see it out , or something to that Purpose : And being asked , Why he did not prevent this Mischief ? said , He swore he would be the Death of him , and thought his Life was as sweet to himself , as the other 's to him . William Strain , produced by the Prosecutor , agreed with the foregoing Evidence , in most of the Circumstances ; he says , That when Wilson came into the Coffee-house , after the Rencounter in the Street , his Sword was drawn , and that when the Deceased came in ( he can not tell whether Wilson was in the little Room , or the Coffee-Room ) he went up towards the Fire-place ; whether his Sword was drawn or not he can not tell ; and that Wilson came round the right Side of the Post and said , Now fight me , or something to that Purpose , and then they fell to fighting ; and he heard the Deceased say , he had enough , and dropped against a Table . Gen. Wentworth . Last September was Twelve-month the Prisoner came to me in the Island of Cuba , upon the Recommendation of a Gentleman , and I appointed him a Lieutenant ; he is a Person of a civil peaceable Behaviour . Gen. Blakeny gave him the same Character . Col. - I commanded the Regiment in the West-Indies , in which Wilson was a Lieutenant ; he is a Person of a general good Behaviour ; he is neither addicted to quarreling , or any other Vice whatever . The Council for the Prisoner asked Gen. Wentworth , Whether the Prisoner would not have been broke by a Court Martial , had he declined fighting the Deceased ? Gen. Wentworth . They pass severe Censures on such Occasions . Court . That is a strange Question in this Court . Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 165.
