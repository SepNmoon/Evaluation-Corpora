Pieces , 4 Guineas , and 1 half Guinea , the Money of Robert Barnard , in his dwelling House , Dec. 15 . Robert Barnard . I am a Weaver , and live in Peter-Street , Bishop's-gate Parish . I was out of Doors when this was done ; but when I came Home , I found the Chest open in my Chamber , ( into which I had put my Money ) with the Keys hanging in the Lock . The Money was taken away , but the Bag , and a Silver Spoon which likewise lay in the Chest were left behind . I imagin 'd that somebody who knew the House must be concern 'd , and the Prisoner who had serv 'd me as a Quill-Boy , being observed to be pretty full of Money , I suspected him ; he was taken and brought to the Magpye-Tavern , where he confess 'd that he got over the Wall , into the Yard , and open 'd the Back Door ; then went up Stairs into my Chamber , and took my Keys out of the Table-Drawer ; that he found the Key of the Chest , and took the Purse out of the Bag , and a little Box , in which were four Guineas and a half I ca n't tell whether he was so wise as to know what Pieces they were , but he own 'd he took all that he found there . There were no Promises of Pardon , or any thing like it , made Use of to get this Confession from him , but we desired him to speak the Truth to the best of his Knowledge . Jury . Was the Prisoner acquainted with your House ? Barnard . Yes ; he liv 'd with me about a Quarter of a Year , as a Quill-Boy , and left me in February last . I believe he is between 13 and 14 Years of Age . Prisoner . I am not 13 yet . Jury . Was any of the Money found on the Prisoner ? Barnard . We did not search him , but he told his Brother where some of it was hid , and we found it accordingly . Peter Nettle . On Friday the 2d of January , Wilson the Officer , told me he had a Woman at the Watch-House , and desired me to go with him ; I accordingly did , and while we were examining her , the Boy ( the Prisoner ) who had absconded , was brought to us . We took him into a Room by himself , and ask 'd him if he would not relate something to us ; he was desired to declare the Truth , and if any Mercy was to be expected , it must be by such Methods . At first , he said , he found the Money in Moorfields ; but I told him , that was nothing but an Evasion of his , and if he did not declare the Truth , it would be the worse for him : He then fairly own 'd that he got over Barnard 's Wall into the Garden , open 'd the Back-Door , and went up Stairs into the Bed-Chamber ; that he open 'd the Table-Drawer , and took out a Bunch of Keys in a String ; he went into the Closet where the Chest stood , and after he had try 'd several Keys , at last found the right ; that he took the Purse with the Money , and likewise a little Pill-Box , in which there was other Money , and a Pair of Buttons ; that he threw them away , and kept the Money for his own Use . I ask 'd him whether any Body was concern 'd with him , and that Night he refus 'd to tell me ; but on examining him again next Morning , he burst in Tears , and said , if he confess 'd , we should hang his Mother . I said , if she had been so inhuman as to put the Rope about his Neck , he had better be an Evidence against her : He then said , his Mother help 'd him over the Wall , and waited till he came back again , and that they both went Home together . He said , he made his Sister a Present of four of the 36 s. Pieces , and gave his Mother the Remainder , all but one Guinea , with which he bought a Pound of Butter , that he might get it chang 'd ; that he threw the Butter away , and appropriated the Money to his own Use . The Mother and the Daughter , both abscond for this Affair . Prisoner . They took me to the Magpye , and made me fuddled , and I did not know what I said . Nettle . He was very sober ; - he had some Bread and Cheese , and Small Beer there , and but one Glass of Wine . John Malton . Mr. Barnard told me he had been robb 'd of all the Cash he had in the World , and shew 'd me the Place from whence it was taken . I ask 'd him if he suspected any Body ; he told me he had a little Boy lived with him about 3 quarters of a Year ago , and he could suspect no one else . About a Fortnight after this , we got a Warrant and the Mother and Daughter absconded , but the Boy was brought to us at the Magpye , by his Uncle , and he own 'd before several People that he got into the House , and took his Master 's Money . The next Day he was brought to Mr. Nettle 's House , and I desired him to tell the Truth , `` I did ( said he ) get over the Wall , and go into my `` Master 's Chamber ; I have seen where he put his `` Keys , so I open 'd the Chest , and took out the Purse , `` and the Box , with a great deal of Money in them , `` and a Pair of Buttons , which I threw away . '' I ask 'd him what Money it was ? he said it was brave large yellow Money , and there were two Pieces as big again as the rest , and a great many alike . I took a Moidore out of my Pocket , and shew 'd him that , but he said the Money was bigger than that . He likewise said , that he gave four Pieces to his Sister , and the rest to his Mother , all but one Guinea , with which he bought a Pound of Butter , in order to get Silver . After the Prisoner was in the Compter , he told his Brother he hid some of the Money under a Shed in the Tenter-Ground , and going to take it from thence , some of it dropp 'd into a Crevice , and he could not get it out again : We went to this Place , and dug out these four 36 s. Pieces . Richard Shooter , the Prisoner 's Brother . I am 13 Years old , and know if I take a false Oath , I shall go to Hell . I went to see my Brother in the Compter , and ask 'd him if he had spent all the Money ; he said No , for he had hid some of it in the Tenter Ground , and going to take it away , part of it roll 'd into a Hole , and he could not get it out again : I went to the Place with Barnard and Malton , and look 'd into the Hole , and saw one of the Broad Pieces ; I try 'd to get my Hand in , but could not , so they got a Pick-Axe , and dug them out . David Shooter . I am the Boy 's Uncle : I went down to Chatham , and found him with another Brother who is bound to a Hoy-Man . I took him on Shore , and ask 'd him what he had done to bring his Friends into so much Trouble ? he said at first , that he gave his Mother the Money , but told her he had found it . When we came to Stroud , he told me he found it in the Tenter-Ground ; I desired him to tell the Truth , and he said he did commence ( commit ) the Robbery , and all the Way as we were coming to Town , he said his Mother did not know but that he found it ; but on the Saturday following , he own 'd his Mother assisted him in the Robbery . - He is about 13 or 14 Years old . Prisoner . I found it in the Tenter-Ground , wrapp 'd up in a Rag : - I have no Witnesses , for I was by myself . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty , Death ; but desired he might be recommended by the Court to his Majesty 's Mercy . 3. Thomas Ducket , was indicted for stealing 4 lb .

The last Time I open 'd the Box , was in May last , and then all my Goods were safe ; but on the 17th , or 18th of December , I open 'd it again , and these Things were gone . I am sure I lock 'd it when I left it with my Friend , and when I came to look for my Goods , I found that the Bottom of the Box had been taken out . I then took the Prisoner ( who was Servant to the Woman with whom I left the Box ) on Suspicion of taking my Goods , and she confess 'd it , and said she had pawn 'd them at one Wilson 's , in Hart-Street , Covent-Garden . Elizabeth Hankinson . I lodged at Mr. Rigg 's , in Drury-Lane , and the Prisoner was my Servant . Mrs. Smith left a Box of Goods lock 'd up with me , and I put it into my Bed-Chamber , and sometime afterwards she sent the Key that I might send her something out of it , but when I came to unlock the Box , there was nothing in it .

I have lent her half a Crown , 3 s. 20 s. and 30 s. on Goods , but 36 s. is the largest Sum that I ever lent her at a Time . - I did not ask her every Time she came with the Goods , whose they were , because I had known her a long Time ; I have taken Things of more Consequence than these from her , and always thought her honest .

No ; if I was to die this Moment , I never did . Prisoner . Did you not shew me your Wife 's Things , and your Money , and say , when your Wife died , I should be your Second , and all would be mine ? Griffith . No ! on my Oath I never offered any Thing to her in my Life . She had my Wife 's Gown on her Back when she was before the Justice . William Price . The Prosecutor desired me to apprehend the Prisoner , and accordingly on the 20th of December last , I took her at Harwich , whither she went in order to go to Holland . I had known the Prisoner before , and asked her if she was not surprized to see me ; she said she was ; I then asked her whether she had spent all the Money ? she said she had not , but put her Hand into her Pocket , and gave me a 3 l. 12 s. Piece , which she said was all that was left , except a little Silver . I took her Trunk to my Inn , and on my enquiring after her Mistresses-Ring , she pull 'd it off her Finger , and said , she did not know that she had taken it , 'till after she went away : She had these Silver Buckles in her Shoes at the same Time , and before we came out of the Stage-Coach , she gave them to me . When I apprehended her , I ask 'd her for the rest of the Things , and she told me they were in her Trunk , and I accordingly found an old Velvet Hood , which the Prosecutor own 'd , and likewise four new ones , which the Prisoner said she had bought ; she confess 'd to me , that she had taken 83 l. 12 s.

This Gown was on the Prisoner 's Back when she was before the Justice , and she own 'd that she had taken a gold Ring and a pair of Buckles out of the Prosecutor 's House : She was charged with the Money , but I ca n't say whether she confess 'd that . Adam Price . I went to see the Prisoner , and asked her if any Body was concern 'd in this Affair , but she said she did it by herself , and had no Design of robbing her Master , 'till that very Morning she did it . She own 'd that she had taken the Money out of a Chest of Drawers in her Master 's Bed-chamber , but said that she did not break the Drawers open . Prisoner .

John Sheriff , was indicted for stealing a Mare of a Bay Colour , val . 5l . the Property of Edward Cook , Dec. 15 . Thomas Arnold . I have nothing to say but that the Mare is my Master 's Right and Property ; he sent her to Grass at Harrow on the Hill , last St. Luke 's Day . The Prisoner was taken at Kensington , and carried before Sir Edw Hill , where the Mare was brought , and he own 'd it to be the same which he stole , but I did not hear him mention the Place from whence he took her . William Fearon . I took the Mare to Weston 's House , and he put her into a Stable whilst I drank a Mug of Beer with some Neighbours ; the Prisoner came in and threw himself into my Company . I gave him some Beer , Bread and Cheese to get rid of him , and while I was drinking with my Friends he took an Opportunity to steal the Mare . The Prisoner was afterwards taken with the Mare , and I am sure she is the same that Weston put into his Stable while I was drinking . When the Prisoner was secured , he begg 'd my Pardon , and said he was sorry he took the Mare . He likewise confess 'd the Fact before the Justice . Jonathan Weston . Mr. Fearon came on the 15th of last Month to my House , the Queen's-Head , on Bushy-Heath , and deliver 'd the Mare into my Hands ; he desired me to take Care of her , for she was at to slipt her Bridle ; so I shut her in secure , and in the mean Time the Prisoner came in , and said he was a Deserter , and if any Body would carry him to his Colonel , there would be 20 s. Reward for them . In a little Time , I saw the Prisoner in the Stable , and turn 'd him out , and about an Hour afterwards , I went to fetch Fearon his Mare , but she was gone . The next Day as I was going to Smithfield , to enquire after her , a Man came to me , and said he had got both Man and Mare . The Prisoner was brought back , and own 'd that he took the Mare out of the Stable , but in Excuse said , he design 'd to ride to his Colonel , and send her Home again . Nicholas Kemston . On the 15th of Dec. about Five in the Morning , the Prisoner came on the Back of the Mare to the Swan , at Kensington-Gravel-Pits , and desired me to put her into the Stable , and give her some Corn and Hay ; I told him we had no Stable , but there was a Shed with a Table in it , and he might draw the Table out , and the Mare might eat there ; he call 'd me out and gave me his Garter to te to her Bridle , for he said she was apt to slip it , and get loose . I suspected he did not come honestly by her , so I and the next Witness agreed to stop him , and we would have had him rode back again , but he would not . John Whittle . This Kemston told me of this Affair , and I had a Suspicion that the Prisoner stole her ; he said he came from Enfield-Common , and was going to Hammersmith to his Master , but he could not tell his Name ; I then desir 'd him to let me ride behind him a little Way ; he refus 'd , and said the Mare was lent to him by Farmer Fearon .

Last Saturday Night , between 6 and 7 o'Clock , I was coming out of Sherbourne-Lane , and had 13 s. and an Half-penny in my Pocket ; the last House I came from was the Black-Bull Alehouse . There were some Boards laid over a wet Place at the Corner of the Mansion House , and a Man laid hold of my Arm , and said he would help me over the Boards ; I said if I wanted any Assistance , I could give the Man a Half-penny ; notwithstanding that , he held my Arm up a great Height , so that he numm 'd my Fingers that I had no use of them . While he was doing this the Prisoner Young came before me , and immediately I felt her Hand in my Pocket ; upon that I put my Hand into my Pocket and seized her by the Wrist ; - her Hand was clench 'd in the Bottom of my Pocket ; upon my doing this , she with her other Hand struck me a great Blow on the side of the Face , so that I was obliged to quit her Hand which was in my Pocket , else I should not have left my Money . I then took fast hold of her Cloak and never left her 'till I got Assistance to take her from me . The Man immediately quitted me , and ran away ; I cry 'd out , For God 's Sake stop that Man , for he has held me , while the Woman has robbed me : A Coal-Heaver happening to come by , laid hold of him by the Collar , and that other Woman Davis went up to the Man and help 'd to get him away , she said she knew him for he was a very good House-keeper and lived the other Side of Moorfields ; - she did not molest me but endeavoured to get the Man away from my Friend , and on his escaping she was secured . I am positive the Prisoner Young is the Person whose Hand I took in my Pocket , for it was just under the first Lamp by the Mansion House as you go from hence . When she pull 'd her Hand out of my Pocket it was clenched , and I lost out of the 13 s. and Half-penny , two half Crowns and 7 s. - I am sure I had it in my Pocket when the Prisoner came up to me . I ca n't say how near Davis was to me , but she help 'd to pull the Man from the Coal-Heaver , and Young dragg 'd me 'till she came up to them . Prisoner . Did you see any Money in either of our Hands ? Gardner . No , but Young had her Hand clenched in my Pocket , and I said , Hussey you have got my Money , upon which she struck me such a Blow , that I was obliged to quit her Hand ; I should not have lost my Money if I could have kept her Hand . The Prisoner Young offer 'd me , at the Butcher 's Shop in Bearbinder-Lane , a Guinea and a gold Ring , if I would put up with this and let her go ; she offer 'd to leave it with Mrs. Jefferies the Mistress of the Shop . I had her near an Hour in Custody before I could get an Officer . - The other Woman Davis on the Man 's escaping was secured by the Coal Heaver . I found Young 's Hand in my Pocket , but she gave me the Blow before she left my Pocket . Prisoner . Was you in Fear ? Gardner . Yes , to be sure I was , I was in Danger of my Life ; the Man kept me close up to the Boards , and the Woman came before me immediately . Young . How long was it between your losing your Money , and your laying hold of me ? Gardner . I never left her 'till Mr. Day the Green-Grocer came to my Assistance . Young . Where did you lay hold of me ? Gardner . Just at the Corner of Walbrook ; - I had not set my Foot on the Planks , but I was as near to them as could be . Davis How far from Stocks-Market was it that you laid hold of me ? Gardner . I never laid hold of you , but I saw you pull the Man away . Mr. Day laid hold of the Woman in the red Cloak ( Young ) and the Mob help 'd to bring the other into Bearbinder-Lane . Prisoner . Was you in any Fear when your Money was taken away ? Gardner . Yes ; I was afraid I should get a Mischief by them , I was afraid of my Life . I had her Hand in my Pocket some Time after the Man left me , and the moment I cry 'd out , he ran away . It was my right Arm which the Man held , and my Pocket I commonly wear under my Gown on the right Side , so I clapp 'd my left Hand which was at Liberty , under my Apron , into my Pocket in this Manner [ Here the Witness shewed the Manner in which she seiz 'd Young 's Hand in her Pocket ] and seized her Hand clench 'd in the Bottom of my Pocket . The Man when he took hold of me , said , I will help you over Child , for if you should slip into the Water , you will be worse off : immediately Young 's Hand was in my Pocket , and I said , this Woman has got all that I have in the World . I quitted her Hand in my Pocket to get hold of her Cloak , and to prevent her doing me further mischief . Samuel How . Last Saturday Night , I was going to see my Sister and her Child Home , and just as we came to the Mansion House , the poor Woman cry 'd out , Lord , I am ruin 'd ! I am ruin 'd ! I left my Sister , and laid hold of the Man , and this Woman said , this Man has ruin 'd me : I held him about a Minute and a half , and these two Women ( the Prisoners ) came to me , and got hold of me : - Those are the Women at the Bar , I will take my Affidavit of it , they were both upon me at once , and if it had not been for them , I should have held him . I saw them both near the Prosecutrix , before she cried out . Davis . How far was it from the Place where the Man got away , to the Place that he laid hold of me ? How . While the Man and I were struggling , and they were upon me , away run the Man ; I pursued him , and they ran after me , and then I laid hold of that Woman in the white Cloak ( Davis ) but she had a red Cloak on then ; - I would not tell a Lie if I knew it . Mr. Day . I was sitting in my back Room , and a great many People were running by to Bearbinder-Lane , and just against the Butcher 's Shop , this Man had hold of the Woman with the white Cloak ( Davis . ) The Prosecutrix said that Woman ( Young ) had pick 'd her Pocket of 12 Shillings , she had not a Hat on then , but one under her Cloak I was resolv 'd to see the Upshot of this , so I held her , and desired Mr. Jefferies to get an Officer , but he could not ; however , at last I got one who took the Prisoners into Custody . Young . Was the Man at the Butcher 's Shop by ? Day . Yes ; the Woman said , that is the Woman that pick 'd my Pocket , and I said I would not let you go 'till it was set to Rights ; - You took a Black Hat out of your Cloak , and put it on . Mary How . My Brother was going Home with me and my Child , and just at the End of the Pales at Stocks-Market , I heard the Woman cry out , the Man had held her , while the Woman robb 'd her ; my Brother then laid hold of the Man 's Collar , and the two Prisoners slew at him , with both their Hands in his Face ; I heard them say , the Man was a good House-keeper , and they knew him well . I laid hold of Davis 's Cloak , and she desired me not to use her ill . The Woman that cry 'd out , was by the two Prisoners , but I really ca n't say whether she had hold of Young 's Cloak . C. Was the Woman that complain 'd she was robb 'd , following the Man ? Mrs. How . Yes , directly down the Lane , they all went down by the Side of the Boards together ; I put my Child into the China-Shop and followed them . Young 's Defence . John Howard . I keep a Hatter's-Shop , in Lothbury , under the Church . Last Saturday Night about 7 o'Clock , I had been at a Wine-Vault in Bearbinder-Lane , for a Hat to dress , and coming down the Lane back again , I heard a great Noise , the People cry 'd , Stop him ! Stop him ! just by the Mansion-House . Coming nearer to the Place , I saw two Women , one nearer , the other farther off , one seem 'd to be in the Croud , and they said , this is one of the Women . They were both taken up , and somebody cry 'd , he has pick 'd my Pocket ; I was surpriz 'd , for these Women to my thinking , were going soberly along . The first Woman ( I ca n't say which it was ) had a white Cloak under her Scarlet one ; I believe it was that Woman that stands there ( Davis . ) They were going before a Justice , and I went down Bishop's-gate-street with them to a Square there , - I thought it a strange Thing that the Woman should cry stop him ; so I ran down T hrogmorton-street with them , but my Cough coming , I could not keep even with them , but I founded them all the Way , 'till they came hither ; and while I stood here in the Yard , I heard a Man say , I am sure I could never say who pick 'd her Pocket , but I catched hold of the Man 's Collar , and he got away . I was close by the Mansion-House when I heard the Words Stop him ! - I was coming down Bearbinder-Lane , and turning the Corner , there was a great Mob ; - I had been to Salter's-Hall . Jury . We desire he may be ask 'd , who these Wine-Vaults belong to ? Howard . I was order 'd to go there , - it is a Wine-Vault just through Salter's-Hall . I ca n't tell the Name . I went to one of the Servants , who had left Word at my Shop for me to come to him . Jury . What is his Name ? Howard . I ca n't tell , - if I go to a Wine Vault , I ask for the Servant that ordered me to carry the Hat . Jury . Is it a Wholesale or Retale Cellar ? Howard . I do n't know ; there are a great many Hundred Pipes in the Cellar . C. Is it customary to dress Hats for People whose Names you do not know ? Howard . Yes ; I carry them Home , and sometimes I am paid , and sometimes not ; if I carry a Hat to a Tavern , I say it is for one of the Drawers , and they enquire about the House for the Owner . I did not hear Women mention 'd , but the Woman cry 'd Stop him , he has robb 'd me ; and when I saw the Croud altogether , that Davis was a matter of 20 Yards from the Croud . C. Were they not held by any Body ? Howard . I believe it was that Gentlewoman ( Young ) in the Croud , but I ca n't say any Body held her . I have seen Davis before : - I know her no farther than her passing by my Shop two or three Times , but if I was to meet her in the Street again , I do n't know her , - I could not swear to her . Prosecutrix . I never saw this Man all the Time . Mr. Day . I know the Man very well , and should have seen him if he had been there . John Michena . I had been to Mr. Siddal 's , on London-Bridge , and coming back about 7 at Night , there was a Mob , and I went to see what was the Matter ; I heard a Woman cry out , the Lord have Mercy on me , the Rogue has pick 'd my Pocket ; and nothing said about Women ; - no one had hold of the Man , neither Man nor Woman . There was a Man , and likewise 2 Women coming along , and another Woman after them , and there was no Body laid hold of , that I saw , for I did not stop , but went directly Home . Davis 's Defence . Ann Jones . I know Mrs. Davis very well ; she is a Mantua-maker , and lives near me , by Bethlem-Wall , through Great-Moregate . She call 'd me between 3 or 4 in the Afternoon , to go with her to the Black-Boy , in Deadman's-Place , and coming back by Stocks-Market , there was fighting and noise , I was frighten 'd , and lost her in the Croud ; - they said , they had laid hold of a Woman , but I did not see her ; I heard a Woman say she had lost her Money , and spoke something of a Man , but nothing of a Woman . I take in Clear starching and Plain-Work . Elizabeth Broadwater . I know nothing of this Affair , but the Gentlewoman ( Davis ) has lodg 'd in my House about eight or nine Months ; she is a Mantua-Maker ; she behav 'd very well to me , and paid for every Thing . I keep a Cook's-shop , almost the very next Door to Mr. Wright 's , the Baker 's , at London-Wall , by Great-Moregate . Jury . I am afraid you are near Stocks-Market , very often . Broadwater . No ; I am not , - I live with my Father , and my Father lives with me . Lydia Walker . I live in the Walk which leads from Holy-Well Mount , to Hoxton , and take in Quilting . Mrs. Young I have known better than a Year ; she rents a Room in my House at 2 s. a Week , and takes in Plain-work . I have seen her receive Money , and never saw nothing but what was modest and well behaved . Amelia Harwood . I have known Mrs. Young about 3 Quarters of a Year ; Mrs Walker desired me to help her to some Plain-work , and a very good Workwoman she is ; she has worked for a great many good House-keepers that I know , and they liked her extraordinary well . I met her in Whitechapel . and desired her to go with me to the Rose , at Holborn-Bridge , so , just as we came by the China-Shop , the Corner of the Market , there was a Croud , - it was about 6 o'Clock , and Mrs. Young said , somebody is beating his Wife , and she would go to see what was the Matter . We went up a Passage , and the Woman laid hold of her , and said , you are one of the Women that help 'd to rob me : presently another Woman was taken , and I was afraid they would lay hold of me . C. Where was it that the Woman laid hold of Young ? Harwood . I was in so much Surprize , that I could not take Notice . C. to Ann Jones . Was any Body in your Company except Davis ? Jones . No ; I did not meet that Woman in the red Cloak ( Young ) all the way . Both Guilty . Death 17.

[ Branding . See summary . ] 18 , 19 , 20 Elizabeth Fox , Priscilla Mahon , alias Trilcourt , and John Elvar , of St. Martin in the Fields , were indicted for that they on the 23d of October last , in the dwelling-House of a Person unknown , on William Layton , in the Peace , & c. did make an Assault , and him in Fear , & c. did put , and 5 Portugal Pieces , val . 9 l and 1 Portugal Piece , val . 18 s. the Money of the said William Layton , from the Person , against the Will of the said William , did steal , & c . William Layton . As I was going down the Hay-market , the 23d of October , between 7 and 8 o'Clock , the Prisoner Fox came up to me ; I said Mistress it is a very cold Night , and she said a Dram wou 'd do very well , and if I would go with her we might have a Dram of very good Rum just by ; I told her I did not care , if I could get a Dram of that which was good , but I belived it would come to neither of our Shares . I went with her to this House , and Mabon followed us in , and when we had drank 3 Quarterns , I would have come out , and was got to the Door for that Purpose , but Fox and Mabon siezed me , and broke a little Stick which I had in my Hand ; they struck and punched me , and made my Cheeks bleed ; - the Blood is now to be seen on my Coat : I asked the Man who went for Landlord , what was the Meaning of all this ; for they had almost got the Money out of my Pocket , and I said I would send them to the Round-house ; upon that the Landlord curs 'd them and seemed to take my Part , and desired me to come in and set by the Fire . I went in and staid some Time and there was nobody there but the Landlord , and one that went for Mistress , and the Prisoner Elvar . While I was talking with the Landlord , Richardson the Accomplice came in and call 'd for Punch , and they went into another Room and would give me some Liquor ; the Landlord set his Back against the Wall and poured out a Glass of red Stuff ; I said I had no Money , and would not drink it , and thought somebody would come in , that I might get away ; but he swore I should drink it ; I ask 'd him what it was . O ! ( says he , ) it is Bitters and very wholsome . We sat talking some Time , seemingly very good natur 'd , and I said , is it not Time that the Watchman should come about ? for I thought to get to the Door when the Watch came by ; but he said , No , No , it is not so late as you think . I began to be very uneasy , and in a little Time after they gave me another Glass , and were vastly desirous that I should drink it , but I said I had rather have a Glass of plain Gin ; however I drank a little , and they insisted that I should drink it up , but I swore I would not ; and as I was getting up to go away , the 3 Prisoners , Richardson and a Man that I never saw before , all rushed into the Room upon me ; Richardson held my two Arms and clapp 'd his Knee on my Back ; - It was done in a Moment ; Elvar came before me and clapp 'd his right Hand on my Throat , and his Left to my Mouth - his Hand was very cold ; at the same Time the two Women came up to me , one on my right Side , and the other on my Left ; they put aside my Cloaths and took out of my right Hand Pocket , my Bag in which were 5 36 s. Pieces , and an 18 s. Piece . Some how or other in the Struggle I threw one of the Men against a Settle , and made a great Racket ; so when they had rifled me they all ran out of Doors ; I rolled myself round , and took up my Hat , and pursued them , crying , Stop Thief and Murder ! I kept them in View , and got Ground of them every Minute . At the End of the Street Mabon separated from the rest , and I desired the Watchman to take hold of them ; he did take Fox but let the other go , so I took Mabon myself to the Watch-House . In a little Time afterwards , the Watchmen found Elvar in the House , and brought him to the Watch-House to the others . Mabon . Ask him whether the Men or the Women pick 'd his Pocket ? Layton . Elvar was the first that laid hold of me , and I am sure the Women rifled me ; I had five of them on me at a Time . Elvar . Was it the Man who passed for Landlord that put his Hand to your Throat , or me ? Layton . Elvar put his Hand on me and very cold it was . Elvar . Who put his Knee on your Back ? Layton . I take it to be Richardson . Mabon . Ask him who broke his Stick ? Layton . The 2 Women did , as I was going away . Tho Richardson . On the 23d of October about half an Hour past Ten at Night , as I was going down the Hay-Market , I met Elvar knocking at the Street Door , the corner of Coventry-Court , with a white Tea Cup in his Hand ; he told me my Betty , ( whom I believe is my Wife ) Priscilla Mahon and John Mabon were within Doors . Mabon . This is the Man that the Prosecutor says held him back . Richardson . When I went in , Elvar told me they were in the Back Room ; I went in to them , and they told me that while the old Man ( Layton ) was busie with the Women , one of them had pick 'd his Pocket , and he catch 'd them at it , and took the Money from them directly . They told me they had given him a Potion of Liquid Laudanum to make him quiet ; the Women told me this first in the Back-Room , and when I went into the Fore-Room , Elvar told me the same , and that they were so much in a Hurry that the first Draught had no Effect , but that Cup which I met him with at the Door was a second Potion for him . I saw the old Man was in a Hurry to go away , and then John Mabon and Elvar told the Women in the Back-Room he would go , and said they ( the Women ) must pick a Quarrel with him , and they would come out to assist them : Accordingly the two Men ran out of the Back-Room first , the two Women followed and siezed the Countryman as he sat in his Chair . The Prisoner Elvar laid hold of him by the Throat , and stopp 'd his Mouth with his Coat Sleeve , because he should not make a Noise in the House , and John Mabon bent him backwards ; then Priscilla Mabon open 'd his Buckskin Breeches and took Money in a Canvass Bag , out of his right Hand Pocket . When this was done , they made the best of their Way into the Court , and on Mr. Layton 's crying out , Murder ! Stop Thief ! the two Women were taken by the Watch , and carried to the Round house . Mabon . Ask him on his Oath , whether he was not the Man that put his Knee against Layton 's Back ? Richardson . I was not in the Room then , but on the Threshold of the Door with the Door in my Hand . Mabon . What Time of Night was it ? Richardson . I believe it was a little after Eleven when the Thing was done ; - they made a Noise and sung the Countryman some Songs , that he might not hear the Watch pass by . Elvar . Did I ever give him any Liquor ? Richardson . Elvar fill 'd the second Glass , and it turn 'd the Liquor brown . Elvar . I desire the Prosecutor may be asked whether I was out of the Room ? Layton . Yes , I believe he was out once , if not twice . Elvar . Did not we drink of the same Liquor as you ? Layton . No , they did not drink of the red Liquor ; the Landlord touch 'd it with his Lips , and fill 'd the Glass up to me again . It swell 'd me up very much , but it pleased God I cast it up in the Watch-House . Tho . Williams . I was Watchman at that Time in St. Martin 's Parish , and just after I had called the Hour of Eleven , this Layton cryed , Stop Thief ! in the Hay Market , and was running after the two Women ; I stopp 'd Fox , but the other ran down the Street and Layton after her ; I deliver 'd Fox to my Partner who came to my Assistance , and then went after Mabon and brought her to the Watch-House . The Prosecutor said there were 3 Men concerned , one of them he described to be a short well set Man , another a little Man in a light Wig and a light Coat , and the other a tall Man in a brown Coat . By this Description we went to the House and took Elvar ; we knocked at the Back Door and it was open 'd , and we found him in the House ; - the House has no Landlord in it long , for the People are here to Day , and gone To-Morrow . Salathiel Gardiner . I am a Watchman : On the 23d of October , about half an Hour after 11 at Night , I heard the Countryman cry , Stop Thief ! and at the End of Oxendon-Street , he took hold of the little Woman ; she was running away at the same Time , and Mabon was with her . DEFENCE . Mabon . I drank a Share of three Quarterns of Brandy with the Prosecutor ; and then he left our Company , and went into the Fore Room , where he quarrell 'd with the Landlord ; I ca n't tell what was the Reason of the Quarrel , but he cry 'd , Murder ! and the Woman of the House said to us , Girls , run away , for the Watch will take you . No Watchman took me , but Mr. Layton himself . Fox . The Men were quarrelling , and the Woman of the House bid us run away , for the Watch would charge us . Ask the Prosecutor , how he could see the Person that robb 'd him , being held in that Manner ? Layton . I could , and did see them ; Richardson pinion 'd me back , and the little Woman , ( Fox ) came to my Right Hand Pocket , and took my Money . Mahon . Two People could not pick his Pocket at once . Layton . I believe the Little One took my Money ; but they were both at my Pocket together . Elvar . I was in the House , and saw them quarrelling ; but as to Money , I never saw any , nor ever was near the Prosecutor to lay Hands on him , during the Time he was in the House . When the Quarrel began , I was at one Door , and the People ran out at the other , and Layton pursu 'd them . Elizabeth Holford . I have known Mahon from an Infant , and never knew but that she maintain 'd clear Character . Margaret Cooper . I have known Mahon a Dozen Years , and never knew No Ill by her ; but she always did that which was handsome . - Burnet . I have known her Three Years , and never heard a bad Character of her in my Life . Susan Jones . I have known Elvar six Years , and he never wrong 'd Man , Woman , or Child , in his Life . When the Accomplice was taken up , I went to see him in the Gatehouse , and he told me Elvar was Innocent , and he could , and would clear him . I keep a public Shop and a House of Lodgings , and always took him to bear a good Character . Mary Philips . I have known him from an Infant , and never heard any Ill of him , till this happen 'd . Sarah Murray . I have known him from a Child , and he always behav 'd well . Mary Pill . I lodged over-against his Mother she kept a Shop for a great many Years , and brought her Children up in a very handsome Manner . The Prisoner had a Fit of Illness , and being Poor , was oblig 'd to take up with this Place , till he could get another . Elvar . Richardson has another Wife living now . Richardson . I was married to this Woman , ( Fox ) at the Fleet : I was drunk , and paid the Parson 2 s. but I have another Wife living , and my Daughter is in Court . All Guilty . Death . 21.

See Sessions Book , No . 1. p. 18 . At the Prisoner 's Desire , the Witnesses were examin 'd a-part . Benjamin Parish . I am a Gingerbread-Baker and Confectioner in Oxfordshire , and came to Town the 18th of October last , in order to buy some Grocery . I had a Brother-in-Law in Town , whom I had not seen for 6 Years , and my Wife desired me to enquire after him ; I was directed to enquire for him at one Thomas Fulman 's , a Journeyman Carpenter , in Windsor-Court , Drury-Lane . I accordingly went thither , and the Woman of the House happened to be a Country-Woman of mine ; - it is a private House ; we drank a Tankard of Beer together , and Fulman desired me to stay all Night , least any ill Consequence might attend my going , for it was past Eleven of the Clock . I thought it was impossible I should be robb 'd in the Street , and I went out of the House designing to go to my Inn ; but when I got to the Corner of the Court , I was obliged to go close by Keogh 's House ; immediately two Men and two Women laid violent Hands on me , and pull 'd me into the House , and shut the Door . There were * Ruggaty Madge , ( who was executed ) Catherine Lineham , and the two Prisoners , Dennison and Stacey ; they pulled me down on my Back , and the Woman that was executed , by the Assistance of Stacey and another , tore open my Breeches Pocket , and took out my Gold , to the Value of 23 Guineas , in Guineas and Portugal Pieces , and likewise my Watch . After this they brought in Cherry-Brandy in Pint Mugs , and swore if I did not drink , they would stab me or cut my Throat . I was forced to drink till they thought I had lost my Senses , and then they carried me out of that Room into another , and laid me on a Bed . When they found I began to slumber , they jostled me , and made me drink again . I had a Pair of Spurs which appeared like Silver , and Stacey took one of them off , but put it on again . I made a great Noise for my Money and my Watch ; upon which Stacey , some how or other , slipped my Watch into my Great Coat Pocket , and bid me search myself , for I had lost nothing ; accordingly I put my Hand in my Pocket , and felt some Money , which I hop 'd was my Gold , but I dar 'd not pull it out , for fear they should get that from me . * See Sessions-Book , 1740 , No . 8. p. 271 . Councel . In what Pocket was your Watch , when you went into the House ? Parish . I am positive it was in my Fob , and he put it into my great Coat Pocket . - There were a great many People in the House , that did not come into the Room where I was . Councel . What did they do to you after this ? Parish . They forced me out of Doors , pretending to carry me to my Inn , and led me into Long-Acre , where Stacey kick 'd up my Heels , and Dennison held me , while he rifled me ; I could see several People by me at the same Time . He took a pair of Breeches , and a pair of silver Knee-buckles , which were ty 'd up in a Bundle , a Holland Shirt , my Watch , with the rest of my Money , and my Hat ; I lost my Wig , but I ca n't charge them with that . After this they left me , and I roll 'd into Drury-Lane , where I fell asleep . I am positive the Prisoners are the Men , for I saw them very plain when they forced me out of Doors , and they led me into the Street , one on one Side , the other on the other , and never quitted me till they had robb 'd me . Dennison . Did you see me in the House before you had drank the Brandy ? Parish . Yes , he sat facing the Door when I came in , and I saw him afterwards , for the Watch convey 'd me to the Cart and Horse in Broad St. Giles 's , and he and Stacey came to me there . Dennison talked Irish with the Landlord , and told me , it I sat there a Fortnight it should cost me nothing . Councel . How long did you stay there ? Parish . I staid till Day-light , and the Ostler of my Inn came and took me away . The Prisoners brought a Violin , and we were very merry , for I was in Liquor , and had no Thoughts of my Misfortune . Sometime afterwards , I not knowing how to proceed , a Fellow , one Baker , offer 'd me his Assistance as an Attorney , and got a Bill of Indictment drawn according to his own Way of Thinking ; I paid him 2 s. for it , and he has dropp 'd me , and keeps the Indictment . If I was to see him here I should know him . I have met with just such another Affair , one Lloyd offer 'd himself as an Attorney , he would have made Dennison an Evidence , and would not let me see the Justice upon any Account . Councel . When had you the first Information of the Parties concern 'd in this Street Robbery ? Parish . I had an Information from the Justice , that one of them had made himself an Evidence ; I was in the Country , and was very sorry when I received the Letter , to be taken from my Business . Stephen Macdonnel . I have not a great Acquaintance with Stacey , but I knew Dennison in Ireland . Councel . Did you know one Keogh ? Macdonnel . Yes , he lived in Holford's-Alley , the Corner of Windsor Court . Councel . Do you remember any Thing of one Parish 's coming to Keogh 's ? Macdonnel . Yes , on the 8th of October , about 12 at Night , I was a Bed , and hearing Murder cry 'd , I got up , and came down Stairs , and saw the Prosecutor on his Back ; there were Catherine lineham , Stanton , Margaret Massey , Kate Butler , and the Prisoner Stacey , all upon him . He was lying on the Broad of his Back on the Ground , in one Corner of the Room ; and Arthur O ' Hara held him while Stanton that was hanged , tore open his Pocket , and took his Gold and his Watch . The Gentleman made a great Noise , and said , he was robb 'd ; upon that , Keogh lock 'd the Street Door , and Back Door , and made Signs to Stacey to give him his Watch again ; accordingly he came close by the Prosecutor , and I saw him put the Watch into his great Coat Pocket . After this , they brought in Cherry Brandy in Pints , and made him drink it by Glasses till he was Drunk ; then they kept him in till 2 o'Clock , and after that , Stacey , Dennison , O 'Hara , William Shields , Thomas Cullin , and I went out with him ; Stacey and Dennison took hold of his Arms , and some went before , and some behind him , and we told him we were carrying him to his Inn . In this manner we led him a little belo Dirty-Lane into Long-Acre , till we came to a silent Place , and then Stacey put his Foot before him , and down he fell on the Broad of his Back ; then they took away his Watch , about 18 or 19 s. in Silver , a Bundle , in which were a pair of Breeches , a pair of Knee Buckles , a Shirt , and an empty Cannister , and likewise his Hat ; when this was done , we all went back to the House , and Keogh asked where we had left him ? Stacey reply 'd , we had left him in Long-Acre , and he knew no more what was doing to him than the Man in the Moon . Stacey shewed Keogh what they had taken , and he cast up the Money that was taken in the House , and it amounted to 20 l. all in Gold : I ca n't tell what Money it was , but it was to be equally divided among all the People that were in the House . Councel . Was it divided ? Macdonnel . No , there was another Robbery committed in the House , and Keogh is run away with the Money . Councel . When did you make an Information of this ? Macdonnel . I was taken up in the Sessions that Margaret Stanton was tryed , and a Week afterwards I went to the Justice , and told him the whole Affair . Stacey . Ask him whether he was not in Custody before the Bill was found against Stanton ? Macdonnel . I was taken the very Day she was found Guilty , or the Day after , I ca n't tell which . Defence . Stacey . I have no Defence to make but to plead my own Innocence , and I shall call Witnesses to prove it . - Lyon . I am a Sawyer - . A Gentleman . He keeps a Lodging-House in St. Giles 's . Lyon . The Evidence was taken for rescuing Margaret Massey , and afterwards charged for rescuing Margaret Newel from the Constable ; I ask 'd him before the Justice , whether he knew any Thing of the Robbery at Keogh 's , but he said he knew nothing at all of it . Mrs. Fulman . I live in Windsor-Court , Drury-Lane . Mr. Parish came ' to my House the Night he was robb 'd - I have a young Woman that lodges in my House , and he had picked her up : I found he was my Country-Man , and advised him to stay with me all Night . and he would have staid , but the young Woman did not like him , and would not be with him ; so he went away about 11 or 12 at Night . On the Friday following he came again , and said he had been robbed of all his Money , by Two Women at the Corner House . He staid with me till he had taken the Woman that was executed , and he had no Money afterwards but what I lent him . While he was at my House , one Mary Riley , who lives in the same Court , came to him , and said , she did not know but she could help him to his Money , but she put him off from Time to Time , and at last brought the Prisoner Stacey ; and Parish said , he would give them Five Guineas a-piece to help him to his Money . Richard Baker . I am an Attorney of the Court of Common-Pleas . Mr. Parish . This is the honest Attorney that assisted me . Baker . I served my Clerkship with Sir Samuel Hartshorne , of Northampton . While I was attending on Mr. Parish in October Sessions , in order to prosecute Margaret Stanton , we were at a Public House together , and Stacey came in to us several Times , and the Prosecutor had no Pretension to the Knowledge of him , or said any Thing of the Robbery . I have the more Reason to believe so , because while we were there , a Woman passed by , and he said , Mr. Baker , I verily believe that Woman to be Catherine Butler , one of the Women that robbed me , and I have a great Mind to take her up this Minute ; I advised him not to do so , for ( said I ) it may be she is come to treat with you , and pay you back Part of your Money . The Court severely reprimanded Baker for his Conduct in this Affair . Henry Williams . Stacey is a Neighbour of mine , and has done Business for me as a Marshal's-Court Officer ; but I have not known him for the last Year . Henry Robinson . He has employed me to make Cloaths for him , and paid me honestly . Christopher Eoklin . I have known Stacey about two Years , and never heard that he was Guilty of any Thing , 'till his Consinement . Stephen Banks . I have employed him as an Officer , and he always did my Business faithfully . Dennison 's Defence . Margaret Richards .

I lost the Value of three and twenty Guineas in Gold , out of my Breeches Pocket , and I cry 'd , Murder ! Robbery ! at the same Time . After this they brought in Cherry-Brandy in Pint Mugs , and swore they would kill me , if I did not drink it . Councel . Who were the Persons concerned in robbing you ? Parish . George Stacey , Kate Butler , and Catherine Lineham , helped to hold me , while Stanton rifled me . Councel . Are you sure that Lineham was there and assisted in robbing you ? Parish . Yes ; I am very well satisfied of it . Councel . Did you observe that she was there before you had drank the Brandy ? Parish . Yes , I 'm sure I did . Lineham .

Councel . Did you see any Money taken from him ? Macdonnel . Yes , 20 l. all in Gold , and Keogh said , in two or three Days Time it should be divided among us . Councel . On your Oath was Lineham there ? Macdonnel . I am sure she was ; for she helped to keep him down , while the other robb 'd him . Lineham .

She came to me twice a Day , till she was taken up for another Robbery , and put into Bridewell .

I told him it was very proper that I should see his Master , and know whether he was the Owner of it or not ; then he said his Master was at his Lodging in Summer-street , Cold Bath Fields ; I accordingly went there , but no Master was to be found . The next Morning the Woman Prisoner came to me , and said , I might be very easy for there was no Advertisement ; she pull 'd a News-Paper out of her Pocket ; and on looking over it , I found this very Tankard advertised . I then acquainted Mr. Gibson , and he told me he had got a Man in Custody , on Suspicion of stealing it ; and in a few Hours I saw the Prisoner before the Justice , and knew him to be the Man that came to my Shop . Prisoner . Ask him whether it was brought in my Name ? Kay . No , he said he had it from his Master . Prisoner . Here is a Woman that was at my Lodging when Norcatt brought this Tankard . Mary Harding . On the 10th of December , I was going to the other End of the Town , and called in Summer street , where the Prisoner lived . The Prisoner 's Wife asked me to stay to Breakfast , and while I was there , a pretty tall Man in blue grey Cloaths came up stairs ; - this was about 11 o'Clock in the Morning ; he had a Tankard without a Lid under his Coat , it was tied up in a speckled Handkerchief ; he said he wanted about 40 s. on it , for he was in inlection of being arrested and he delivered it to her , and she went out with it : While she was gone , the Prisoner Richard Laycock came in and asked for his Wife , and the Man told him where he had sent her ; in the mean Time she came up and said , the Pawnbroker suspected the Tankard was stolen ; upon that , the Prisoner flew in a great Passion with his Wife , for going with it , and gave her a great Blow on the Head . The Man then desired the Prisoner to go and fetch either the Money or Tankard , and accordingly he went , and the very next News that I heard of them was , that they were in Consinement . I believe this was either Wednesday or Thursday , and I am sure it was the 10th of December . Mr. Kay . This very Woman came to me 3 or 4 Days after Lacock 's Commitment , and said he was her Husband , and if she could be of any Service to him in saying any Thing in his Behalf she would ; that she had received a Letter from him , and 'till then she knew nothing of the Affair . Harding . He is not my Husband ; I had a lawful Husband , and he died on board the Scarborough Man of War . Gibson .

Did you see any Man in the Room , in a blue grey Coat ? Gibson . No , the Prisoner was the only Stranger in the Company ; all the rest were Neighbours and creditable House keepers . Prisoner .
