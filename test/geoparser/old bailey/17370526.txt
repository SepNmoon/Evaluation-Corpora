John Smith otherwise Simms , was indicted for stealing five Pieces of Gold , value 3 l. 12 s. each ; eight Pieces of Gold , value 36 s. each ; two Moidores , one Piece of Gold , value 18 s. three Pieces of Gold , value 13s . 6d . each , 121 Guineas , sixteen Half Guineas , and 2 l 10 s. in Money , the Monies of John and Joseph Wight , in their Dwelling-house , April 17 . Joseph Wight . I have known the Prisoner near five Years ; he was my Father 's Servant , and my Father is a Writing-Master , Mr. John Wight . The Money he stands indicted for , is the Property of my Father and me ; I reckoned it and put it up on Saturday the 16th of April , and on Sunday my Desk was broke open , the Money was taken out , and a Drawer was missing ; I ca n't say directly what Money was in it , but there was 175 l. odd in that one Drawer ; there was 121 Guineas , there was sixteen Half Guineas , and five Three Pound Twelve Pieces : I have an exact Account ] in Writing of the Money that was found upon him . Q . How came you to suspect the Prisoner ? Wight . Because he absented himself from my Father 's Service on the 17th of April in the Evening . We advertis 'd him and described him , - about seventeen Years of Age , - a down Look , - very surly way of Speaking ; and his Cloaths were described . Q . How long was it before he was taken ? Wight . We had Advice from Justice Scroop and Justice Reynolds of Lincolnthat such a one was taken the Thursday before . The Money found upon him was 175 l and upwards .. I saw him the Night he was brought up , and asked him a Question , but he would give me no Answer , or nothing to the Purpose , nor did he confess any thing in my Presence . John Wight I have known the Prisoner five Years and upwards ; he was my 'Prentice . On Sunday the 17th of April between four and five in the Afternoon , he asked me Leave to go and see his Father for half an Hour ; I gave him Leave , and his not returning Home , made me have a Suspicion he had done some Mischief ; accordingly going into my Son 's Room where we keep the Money , I found the Desk broke open ; upon which I went to his Father-in-Law to acquaint him of it , but he could say nothing to the Purpose ; so I went to the Printer of the Daily Advertiser , to have him inserted in the Papers the next Day , which was done accordingly . Then I apply 'd to the Post-Office , to have Expresses sent to divers Places , and on Monday se'enight afterwards , I receiv 'd a Letter from Mr. Scroop and Mr. Reynolds with notice that there had been a Person apprehended at Lincoln , which answer 'd the Advertisement that was given of him , and that he had made a Confession before them , that he was my Servant , and had robb 'd me , but not of so much as I charge him with . I sent down a Friend , and when my Friend came , he was call 'd upon again , to a second Confession . Q . Had you any Talk with him concerning the Fact ? Wight . No , I never went near him my self . William Moreton . I have known the Prisoner 2 or 3 Years : I know nothing of the Fact , only I know that this Drawer was taken out of the Prisoner 's Trunk ; the Trunk was lock 'd , and the Drawer was lock 'd up in it . Joseph Wight . This is the Drawer in which was 175 l. odd . John Wight . This is the Gentleman I sent down to Lincoln . Paul Brown . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury . After the Wights had received Letters from Mr. Scroop and Mr. Reynolds , at their Request I went down to Lincoln , and I got there the 27th of last Month . I went to the Prisoner in Lincoln Goal , and after some Discourse with him , finding he confessed only 161l I advised him to give an Account of the whole Sum ; and the next Morning when I went to him again , he gave me an Account wrote with his own Hand of 172 l. 9 s. 6 d. which Account is here ; I saw him write it , and I witness 'd the Account . He acknowledged 172l . 9s . 6d . After I had got this out of him , I waited on Mr. Scroop and Mr. Reynolds and it thought proper to take him before them , to get the Confession from him that they might be saved the Trouble of coming to prove the first Confession . This Confession I saw the Prisoner sign , and saw the Justices sign it too , and I witness 'd it . After this was done I received from Mr. Scroop 154l . 14s . 6d . in a Bag ; Mr. Scroop advised to have taken 156 l. 10s . 6d . but before they sealed up the Money , they gave the Prisoner 36 s to bear his Expences , which Sum taken out of 156 l. 10 s 6 d. makes 154 l. 14 s. 6 d. which was the Money I recieved . Q . How old are you ? Prisoner . Sixteen . John Wight . Look upon the Confession , - it is eighteen there. `` The second Examination of John Smith , aged `` eighteen , taken upon Suspicion of robbing `` Mr. Wight , a Writing-Master ; who owns `` that he went by the Name of Simms , but `` that his true Name is Smith ; and that he `` was Apprentice to the said Wight , and `` robbed him of 161 l. and upwards , by forcing `` open the Lock of a Desk ; and that `` he ran away from his Master the same `` Day , and made the best of his Way for `` York . John Wight . We have miss 'd Money several Times - small Summs . Q . How did the Prisoner behave before this Fact ? John Wight . He behaved well , to outward Appearance , - about a Fortnight ago he made an Elopement . C. That has no Relation to this Fact . Thomas Aldridge . I have known the Prisoner from his Birth , and never knew him guilty of Theft in my Life . Q . Did he behave well before this Fact ? Aldridge . As other Boys do ; sometimes he would go to Play . He is my Son-in Law . Isaac Walker . I have known him ever since he was born , and never knew any Thing dishonest by him till this Time , and I am heartily sorry for it . The Jury found him guilty . Death . But requested of the Court , that he might be recommended to his Majesty 's Mercy . s 2 , 3 Richard Sampson , and John Nugent , otherwise Tipping , of St. George the Martyr , were indict 'd ( together with John Williamson , otherwise Scotch Jack , Richard Wheatly , and William Hilliard , not taken ) for assaulting the Rev . Mr. Strickland Gough , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Hat . value 6 s. May 14 . Mr. Gough . On Friday Night , May 14 , a little after 12 o'Clock , I was turning up the Corner of Gloucester-street ( where I lodge ) and while a Coach was passing by , I was attack 'd by these Fellows , and receiv 'd several Blows on my Head , which fell 'd me to the Ground . I recover 'd my self and snatch 'd Sampson 's Stick out of his Hand , this is the very Stick : They did not say any thing to me , but only beat me in a very violent Manner . I have now a Wound in my Head two Inches long , and as deep as it can be without breaking the Skull . My Hand was likewise hurt , but whether that was by a Blow or by the Fall I can not tell ; I lost my Hat in the Scuffle , or else they stole it . The Prisoner Sampson confess 'd the Fact , and that there was more of them in Company , but I can swear only to Sampson . I have called to him in the Gatehouse , and when he heard my Name , he said he remember 'd me , and he told me there were six of them in Company , and he had impeach 'd them all to Colonel Deveil . When I came to Mr. Deveil 's I found Sadler the Evidence , and the other Prisoner Nugent , impeach 'd on Sampson 's Confession . Q . Did Sampson say any thing about the Hat ? Mr. Gough . No , nothing at all . Geo Sadler . There were six of us together , and we all went out with the same Intent , to rob who we could . Nugent and Sampson , and Scotch Jack , and Hilliard , and Wheatly , and my self . Going up Gloucester street , by little King-street , a Coach came by , Scotch Jack was first ; he knock 'd the Gentleman down with a Broomstick ; Sampson came up immediately and beat him about the Head with his Stick , and struck him into the Kennel ; as he lay in the Kennel he cry 'd Wa ' a , Wa ' a , for he was so abused that he could not speak plain . As he lay padling in the Kennel , a Man came up and asked what was the Matter , so I ran off a little Way , but return 'd as if I wanted to see what was the Matter too . The Gentleman said he had been knock 'd down and had lost his Hat ; we look 'd for it but 't was not to be found . So we went home with him , and when the Maid open 'd the Door , he bid her not be frighted . Sampson . Speak out George that I may hear you . Sadler . After this I went away , and met the Prisoners the same Night in Holborn - Q . Which of your Companions did you meet there ? Sadler . Scotch Jack , Sampson , Hilliard and Wheatly . I asked Sampson about the Hat , and he told me he had thrown it over some Rails in Gloucester-street to prevent Discovery , and its being taken upon him . Q . Was you apprehended for this fact ? Sadler . Yes ; Mr. Attley took me and Nugent out of Bed : We were both taken up the next Day , and Sampson was took up afterwards . Mr. Attley call 'd me out , and asked me if I had a Mind to save my Life ? I told him I could do a great deal ( discover a great many ) and thereupon I impeach 'd this Sampson and all the rest of them . Sampson was the Man that took the Hat off , I saw him take it off , but I did not see him throw it over the Rails ; may be he sold it , and only told us he threw it away to cheat us of our Shares . Mr. Gough . The Evidence swore he should know Sampson 's Stick if he saw it again . Sadler . This is the very Stick that Sampson had . I cut it up as I came from Epsom . Sampson . Sadler swore before Mr. Deveil , that Nugent went Home ten Minutes before the Thing was done ; he perjur 'd himself before him , and now he swears the Man was in Company . Mr. Gough Sadler did say so before Mr. Deveil , but when he was put to his Oath , he swore Nugent was in Company when the Fact was done . Q . ( To Mr. Gough ) Have you any Memory of Nugent 's being among them ? Mr. Gough . No ; I have no Memory of any but Sampson . Q . Was Nugent in Company when the Attack was made ? Sadler . He was one of the Company , but when the Attack was made he was about ten Doors off , and did not come up till 't was over . Q . Was he by when you agreed to attack Mr. Gough ? Sadler . No ; but he was in Sight of us when we did it . Samuel Berry . Last Monday I was going about my lawful Occasions , and in St. Paul 's Church-Yard I met Sampson with a Pair of Boots which he was going to sell ; these Boots I suspected he had stole out of a Cellar in St. Giles 's , belonging to Mr. Wiltshire ; I look 'd at the Boots and knew them to be Wiltshire 's ; so I seiz 'd him upon this Account . He told me his Life was in my Hands , and desir 'd I would not hang him ; I knew him to be a great Criminal , so I brought him by the Collar to Broad St. Giles 's . He told me of several Robberies , and among the rest of this ; he said he had robb 'd a Clergyman on Friday Se'en night at Night , at the End of Gloucester-street , and says he ( the Clergyman ) is a very pretty Man ; for after we had knock 'd him down , he got my Stick and used it very well , and if the rest of my Companions had not been Rogues , we should have got a good Booty from him . Q . Did he name the Gentleman ? Berry . No , he did not name Mr. Gough , only said it was a Clergyman , and that they knock 'd him down at the End of Gloucester-street last Friday Se'en-night . I asked him if he knew the Clergyman : He said , No . I asked him if he knew what Parish he belonged to : He told me , No . Nor did he know where he liv 'd : But upon his telling me 't was done at the End of Gloucester-street , I went there , and found out Mr. Gough , who told me he had been robb 'd by some Men , and that he had got one of their Sticks from them . Q . What did you do with Sampson ? Berry . I deliver 'd him to this Constable , on Account of the Boots he had stole . Q . How came he to tell you of the Robberies he had committed ? Berry . Because he thought to make himself an Evidence , but Mr. Deveil found him a Liar , and that Sadler told more Truth than he did ; so Sadler was admitted an Evidence . I can tell you a great deal more-about what he said ; but may be you ha'n't Time to hear it . Owen Griffith . I was charged with the Prisoner Sampson on Account of the Boots ; he was desirous to be made an Evidence , so I carry 'd him to Mr. Deveil , and he gave an Account of five more ; upon this Mr. Deveil granted a Warrant for taking them up , and next Morning we took Nugent and the Evidence in Bed together . Sampson told me where I might find them , as I was carrying him to Prison . Sampson . Did you hear me say I took the Hat ? Griffith . He told me the Gentleman had lost his Hat , but he did not know who had it , for sometimes ( says he ) we play sink'em upon one another . Sampson . I desire my Examination before Mr. Deveil may be read . Mr. Deveil 's Clerk . I was present at Sampson 's Examination , 't was taken from his own Mouth , 't was read over to him , and he own 'd it to be true , and sign 'd it in my Presence . The Voluntary Confession of Richard Sampson , taken the 23d of May 1737 . Sign 'd T. Deveil Who being examin 'd says , `` Last Saturday `` Morning between 3 and 4 o'Clock , he with `` Richard Wheatly , William Hilliard , and John `` Williams , otherwise Scotch Jack , feloniously `` broke open the Shop of one Wiltshire , and stole `` 17 Pair of Boots and Pumps . That all the `` Pumps were sold to one Joanna Worthington in `` Wych street ; that she knew them to be stolen `` and the Persons to be Thieves . And that last `` Friday Se'en-night , he , with the aforesaid 3 `` Persons , and Tipping , otherwise Nugent and `` Sadler , attacked a Clergyman near Gloucester-street , `` whom they knocked down , but he making `` Resistance and snatching a Stick out of `` this Examinant 's Hand , his Hat was left in the `` Fray , and they had not Time to plunder him `` of any Thing else . That another Time they `` feloniously assaulted and plunder 'd a Person unknown , `` and robbed him of 4 s.5 d , Half-Penny `` in Money , and a Glass Tobacco Stopper , `` which he has now produced : That the 4 s , `` were taken by Scotch Jack , and the Half pence `` by this Examinant , and that he had his Share `` of the said Money . That they likewise broke `` open the House of Joanna Worthington , behind `` St. Clement 's Church , and took out a Pocket-Book `` and Parcel of Keys , which they returned `` again . That another Time they stole a Parcel `` of Wool from behind a Stage Coach , which `` they sold for 2 s. being about 8 or 10 lb . That `` about 3 Weeks ago they broke open a Taylor 's `` Stall , near Dean street , Soho , and stole a `` Pair of Breeches and a Flannel Waistcoat , `` which they sold , and divided the Money among `` them . Mr. Gough . It was meerly by Sampson 's Means . that the other two were taken up . Sampson . I am wrongfully swore against ; I know nothing of his Hat . Nugent . I know nothing of this ( here ) Thing . He said before the Justice that I was not in his Company when the Robbery was committed . Q . ( To Mr. Gough ) Did Sadler tell you that Nugent was close by when this was done ? Mr. Deveil 's Clerk . He said , that Nugent was at a small Distance . Sampson Guilty . Death . Nugent acquitted . 4. Hannah Rayner , of St. Botolph Aldgate , was indicted for stealing two Silver Spoons , value 12 s the Goods of John BroomwellJones , Esq . April 22 . Guilty 10 d . [ Whipping . See summary . ] 5. Robert Wood , of St. Andrew , Holborn , was indicted for stealing 15 Guineas and 16 s. in Money , the the Property of Richard Tisdale . March 2 . Martha Copperwhite . The Prisoner was my Servant ten Months . He confess 'd in my Kitchen that he took Richard Tisdale 's Money ; 15 Guineas and 16 s. out of a Box in a Room where they both lay . He said he broke the Box with a Picker , and produced 6 Guineas and 9 s. 6 d. of the Money again , but gave no Account what he had done with the rest . The Money which he returned , he had hid under a Stone on the Outside of my Gate . Richard Tisdale . I lost 15 Guineas , and 16 s. in Silver . I miss 'd it the 1st of March ; it was put up in a Box in my Bed-Room ; the Box was locked , but I found the Lock broke , and as none comes into that Room but the Prisoner , we suspected him and charged him with it . He did not confess it at first , but about 3 Hours after we had taxed him with it he made a Confession that he took about 9 Guineas ; that he open 'd the Lock with a Picker , such as we pick Horses Feet with , and that he had lost some of the Money at Gaming ; he shew 'd us where the rest was hid , and we found 6 Guineas , 8 Shillings , and 3 Six-pences .

John Simmonds , of St. John Wapping , was indicted , for that he , after the 24th of June 1726 , viz on the 7th of February , in the tenth Year of his Majesty 's Reign , feloniously and falsely made and caused to be made , a certain forged and counterfeit Writing call 'd a Promissory Note , in the Words following . Aug 28 , 1736 . I Promise to pay to John Simmonds or Order the Sum of Five Pounds four Months after Date , for Value received . Per Thomas Langley . By Reason of which false and counterfeit Writing , Robert Manning was deceiv 'd and defrauded of the said Sum of 5 l. And farther , the said Simmonds on the 7th of February last , the said counterfeit Writing feloniously did publish and utter , knowing it to be false , forged and counterfeit . Robert Manning I have known the Prisoner 3 or 4 Years . He work 'd with me in the Cooper 's Business for 3 or 4 Months together a little before Christmas . He was set up a Master Cooper , and bought several Goods of me , but leaving off Business , I bought them again of him , and he came to work with me ; but not liking his Proceedings , I discharged him ; at that Time he ow 'd me Money , and he gave me this Note in Payment of the said Sum . The Debt was for Timber to make into Casks , which he had of me when he was a Master Cooper . Counsel . What did the Goods come to that you sold him ? Manning . The Goods came to 3 l. 8 s He gave me this Note for the Money , and desired me to pay him 1 l 12 s. out of it . This is the Note , sign 'd Thomas Langley , I believ 'd it was a good Note , so I took it , and kept it 'till it was due ; then I went to the Prisoner , and told him I did not like to go about getting the Money , he must go and get the Money for me , and I let him know that I expected the Money from him . He told me that Langley was in Buckinghamshire , and another Time he was in Northamptonshire , but last he said he worked with one Mathold in Crutched Friars . I had a threatning Letter sent me the 7th of February , which I suspected to come from the Prisoner , and , upon the Receipt of that Letter , I went to enquire after this Langley in Crutched Friars , and then I found it to be a counterfeit Note ; upon this I took the Prisoner up , and before the Justice I asked him where Langley was ; he said he was in Bedfordshire ; but I had found one of the same Name in Crutched Friars . This is a Receipt of the Prisoner 's own Hand-writing , and I have compared it with the Note , and believe the same Hand wrote them both . I saw him write this whole Receipt , and upon my Oath I believe the Hands to be the same . Q . When you found out Mr. Langley , did he tell you he had had Dealings with the Prisoner ? Manning . Mr. Langley knew the Prisoner , and said he had no Dealings with him ; he had apply 'd to him to lend him Money , but he had always refused him . Prisoner . I came to Mr. Manning one Morning , and told him , as I ow 'd him 3 l. 8 s. I would pay him , if he would take a 5 l. Note ; he accepted it , I endors 'd it , and he paid me 1 l. 12 s. out of it , and I told him where the Man liv 'd . I received the Note from a young Man named Thomas Langley , who came from Northamptonshire to get Work in London , and I lent him Money till it came to 5 l. within 10 s. and then he gave me this Note , and said , if I would accept of it , he should be obliged to me ; so I took it , and gave it to Mr. Manning . Q . This Story is suited to your Purpose , but can you make all this out ? Why did you send Mr. Manning to one in Crutched-Fryars ? Prisoner . After I had paid the Note to Mr. Manning , the young Man went down into the Country , and I went to Mr Langley 's in Crutched-Fryars , and asked him to do me a Favour ; I asked him if he knew Thomas Langley , his Namesake ? He said , no . I told him I had a Note for five Pound upon his Name-sake , and I had paid it to Mr. Manning , and if he would be so good as to own the Note , if Manning should come to him about it , I should be obliged to him , and I would give him a Note of 10 l. - to take care of it . C. Then you own it was not Mr. Langley 's Note in Crutched Fryars . Prisoner . It was not . Mr. Langley . About eight Months ago the Prisoner came to me , he sent for me to an Alehouse , and asked me to do him a Favour , and talked something about a Note , but I do n't remember the Particulars . I told him I would not do any such Things , - I would not be concerned in a Note ; I would rather , I said , lend him the Money ; and I told him , if they came to enquire after his Character , I would say he was an honest Fellow . Q . Upon your Oath , what did he say to you ? Mr. Langley . He did say something about a Note of 5 l. and that it would be due about Christmas . I have known him upwards of a Year , and I took him then to be an honest Fellow . Q . ( To Mr. Manning ) The Note was not due till the 28th of Dec. did you go and enquire about it before that Time ? Manning . I received the threatening Letter in the Month of February , and I never enquired about the Note , till I came to Justice Jones about the Letter . Q . ( To the Prisoner ) Can you bring any one to prove there is such a Person as Langley in Bedfordshire or Northamptonshire ? Prisoner . Ask Mr. Langley if he did not say he would pay the Note when the Man came with it . Mr. Langley . No , I never said I would pay it ; I said I would tell the Man when he came with it , that I believed the Prisoner would pay it . Q . ( To the Prisoner ) You told Mr. Manning that it was Mr. Langley 's Note in Crutched-Fryars , and now you own it belongs to another Langley : I would ask you , whether you can produce any Mortal alive , to prove you have such an Acquaintance ? Prisoner . My Acquaintance was but slender with him ; I let him have Money and Goods , and took this Note from him . Q . A slender Acquaintance , and yet you let him have 5 l. Worth of Goods ! Who wrote the Directions to Mr. Langley in Crutched Fryars ? Mr. Manning . I did , a great while after I had taken the Note . Q . ( To Langley ) When the Prisoner came to you , did he tell you any thing about this other Langley ? Mr. Langley . No , I do n't remember that he said any thing about it . Several Persons appeared to the Prisoner 's Character , who all took him to have been an honest Man till this Time . The Jury found him guilty . Death . He was a second Time indicted for that he , being a Person of an evil Disposition and greedy of Lucre , after the 1st of June , 1723 , to wit , on the 8th of February last , knowingly , unlawfully , wickedly , and feloniously , did send a certain Letter or Writing , without Name or Date , demanding twenty Guineas ; and containing divers Threats , as well of the Life of Robert Manning , as the burning the House and Shop of the said Manning , if the said Money should not be paid according to the Demand of the said Letter , to the great Damage of the said Manning , and to the evil Example of others in like manner offending , and against the Peace , & c . Mr. Manning . I received this Letter about the 7th of February ; it was sent by the Penny-Post , and the Postman gave it to my Boy ; - here is the Penny-Post Mark . Joseph Seal . I received this Letter from the Postman , and gave it to my Master . Mr. Manning . I opened it and read it ; and consulting my Friends about the Contents , we resolved to put up twenty Half-pence in the manner I was ordered , and to direct it accordingly . [ Clerk reads the Letter ] SIR , Mr. MANNING . 1736 l `` THE Occasion of this Letter is of great `` Importance : Our Circumstances are `` such , that we would have you think it just `` to insert this in Preference of all Matters else. `` We are Men resolutely bent , on Pain of Death , `` to execute what we have undertaken . Money `` we want , and Money we must have ; and we `` are obliged to raise 100 l. in five Days , or be `` plung 'd into Goal eternal : Therefore we resolve `` that five such worthy Men as you shall `` assist us , and never more be troubled . We `` have cast Lots which Man to begin with first , `` and the Lot has fallen upon you , and will be `` performed as surely as ever you were born , if `` you do n't do according to Order , to restore us `` from eminent Danger , which Downfal will `` prove worse than the Horrors of Hell . You `` are to set the Example , and to lend us twenty `` Guineas , and if you do n't send the Money , `` your Houses , Shops , and Yards , will be made `` as level as Fire can make them , and your Life `` will be in danger ; therefore make no Delay , `` for if you do , dreadful must be the Fall of you `` or us . Put the Money in a small Bag , conceal 'd `` in a Wisp of Hay , made up in a small Parcel , `` and cover 'd with Canvas , made fast and directed `` for Thomas Bull , till call 'd for . Send it `` by your Youngest Apprentice to the Old Green-Dragon `` at Stepney , on Tuesday the 8th , about `` six o'Clock at Night . Send no Watch , nor `` divulge this to none on Earth , but burn it as `` soon as you have received it , if you do n't , `` take what follows ; if you do n't send the Money , `` you may expect a Shout which will tear `` Hell 's Concave ; Destruction , Horror , and `` Death will seize your whole Family . You are `` able to bear this Trifle , so if you do n't send `` the Money on Tuesday Night , look to your self. `` - You never shall be troubled more . ( The Letter was compared with the Receipt , which was produced on the former Trial ) Seal . I carry 'd the Bundle on the Tuesday Night about 6 o'Clock to the Green-Dragon at Stepney . When I went into the House I saw the Prisoner sitting in a Box , I was surprized , and said , John how do you do ? My Master had told me of the Thing , but I had no Suspicion of the Man . - John , how do you do , says I ; I spoke twice to him , but he would not speak , and turn 'd his Back to me : while I went to speak to the Woman in the Bar he went out of the House , and in about half a quarter of an Hour he came in again , - who calls me , says he , I told him I did , and I ask 'd him what he had to do this Way ; he said he had been at Work at Bow : I ask 'd him where about he work 'd there , then he told me , that he work 'd in Whitecross-Street , and that he had left Work there at half an Hour after 4 , then I ask 'd him why he came this Way ; and he said he was to wait for a Friend who had been with him , and was gone to Spring-Gardens at Stepney , and he sent me there to enquire for a Man , but no such Person had been there , nor did the People know any Thing of him . Q . Did you leave the Bundle with the Woman at the Bar before he went out ? Seal Yes . Q . When did he come in again ? Seal . In about a quarter of an Hour : He did not ask for any Thing to be left there . He sent me to Spring Gardens to enquire for his Friend , and when I came back , our Foreman was come in , and had got him in Custody . Q . Did he see you leave the Parcel ? Seal . No , he turn 'd his Back to me when I left the Bundle : I was only to deliver it , so he did not hear me say any Thing when I left it , and his Back was turned to me when I gave it out of my Hands . Q . Did any Body call for the Parcel afterwards ? Seal . No . Prisoner . I would ask him whether he left any Thing at the Bar before me ? Seal . You turned your Back upon me . - Negus . I went with the Boy and the Bundle , and he went into the House about a Minute before me . When I got to the Door , I met the Prisoner coming out , I stopp 'd and said , - John , what do you do here ? He pull 'd his Hat over his Eyes , and would neither look at me nor speak to me , but he shook , and look 'd as if he was struck with Surprize , and went from the Door . The Woman of the House said , why do you come so soon ? I believe that was the Man who was to call for the Bundle . While she was speaking to me he returned , and I said , - John , why do n't you speak ? I thought , says he , somebody call 'd me ; I told him he must come in , I wanted to speak with him ; I hope says he , 't is not for my Hurt . Then I ask 'd him about the Letter , and he said he knew nothing of it : why did you come here to drink says I ? I frequently come in here , says he , as I come from Bow : I have been at Work there , and as I came along , I call 'd in here to drink . Then he told me , that he had li't of two Friends at Why not beat Dragon , and had appointed to meet them at Spring Gardens , and the Reason he did not go to them was , because he us 'd to drink at this House . I sent to Spring Gardens , but no Body waited for him , or wanted him there , so I told him I would send to Bow , and enquire what Time he left Work there ; upon which he said , he had not been at Work there , but in Whitecross-Street . I ask 'd the Woman of the House , if the Prisoner used to drink there , she said , she could not remember every Body that drank there ; but as for him , ( the Prisoner ) she could not recollect that ever she had seen him in her Life . Jane Davis . I live at the Sign of the Ship at Stepney , just facing the Green-Dragon . About a quarter of an Hour before the Prisoner was taken he came into our House , and drank a Pint of Beer ; he asked what 't was o'Clock , and I told him 't was almost 6 : I saw him presently afterwards at the Green-Dragon . - Phipps . On the 8th of Feb. last , about a quarter after 6 , the Prisoner came into our House ( the Green Dragon ) and call 'd for a Pint of Two-penny ; he had not been in long , before Mr. Manning 's Boy came with the Bundle ; he had not been in the House 2 Minutes before the Boy came . I never saw him to my Knowledge in the House before . - Gregory . I went over the Fields with the Boy to Stepney , because we expected the Parcel would be taken from him before he got to the House ; I made the Boy stay a little , that I might go in first . I sat down facing the Bar , and when the Boy came in , the Prisoner look 'd pale , and seem 'd to be in a Confusion . What ! John ! John Symmonds ! says the Boy . He was so confounded that he could not speak , but paid his Reckoning and went out of the House , but he returned in about half a quarter of an Hour , and Mr. Negus laid hold of him , and told him he wanted to speak with him : he asked him if it was for his Good , or for his Hurt ? Mr. Negus told him , 't was not much for his Good , and asked him how he came there ? He said he had been at Work at Bow , that he usually call 'd in there to drink as he came along ; but the People of the House said , they never saw him before to their Knowledge . Mr.Negus told the Prisoner he would send to Bow ; then he alter 'd his Story , and said he had drank with some Friends at Why not beat Dragon , and was by Appointment to meet them at Spring-Gardens . Q . ( To Phipps ) Did any Body ever come to enquire for this Parcel ? Phipps . No . - Potts I was present at the Green-Dragon when Negus laid hold of the Prisoner . He at first said he had been at Work at Bow , and that he call 'd in there for a Pint of Beer , as he usually did ; but when Negus said he would send to Bow , he told him he need not give himself that Trouble , for he had been at Work in Whitecross-Street , and work 'd there 'till 5 o'Clock that Night . Prisoner . I work 'd in Whitecross-Street , but I had been doing a Job for my Mother at Bow that Night ; as I came from thence I met some Friends , and I asked them to drink , so we staid together 'till 't was almost dark , and then I had a Thought came into my Head , that I would go Home to my Lodging just cross the Fields . Q . Where does the Prisoner live ? Seal . In Denmark Street , the other Side of the Fields . Prisoner . The Man that keeps the Ship Alehouse , had once a Note of my Mother 's for 4 l. odd Money , which I had endorsed ; he arrested me for the Money , but I put in Bail , for I was under Age when I endorsed the Note , so we made that Matter up for 25 s. I went to this House to see the Man , his Name is Townshend , but as I was in Debt , I was afraid the Woman of the House ( who knew me ) would give Intelligence of me , so I went over the Way to the Green-Dragon , and I had not been there a quarter of an Hour before Mr. Manning 's Boy came in and spoke to me ; I asked him how he did ; but knowing that I ow 'd Mr. Manning Money upon this Note , I was afraid he might have Bailiffs with him , so I paid my Reckoning , and went out of the House ; as I was going out I met Negus , which made me more apprehensive of being arrested than I was before , but looking about me , and seeing no Body else after him , I returned and went into the House again , and Negus told me of the threatning Letter , and I said I knew nothing of the Matter .

Jane Clark , of St. Paul 's Shadwell , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of William Lambert , about the Hour of 12 in the Night , and stealing 6 Pair of Kid Gloves , value 12 s. 6 Pair of Stockings , value 12 s. a Tea-spoon , value 2 s a Silk handkerchief , value 3 s. and 12 s. 6 d in Money , the Property of William Lambert , August 27 . William Lambert . I hir 'd the Prisoner as a Servant in June , and she liv 'd with me 2 Months , she behav 'd ill , and would get fuddl 'd . On the 27th of August I lost 6 Pair of Kid Gloves , 6 Pair of Worsted Stockings , and a new Silk-Handkerchief No one could take them but her self , for there was no Body in the House but her self and me . Q . Why did you not prosecute her sooner ? Lambert Because she kept out of the Way . She came in that Night fuddl 'd ; I told her she should stay no longer than Morning , and I thought she went to Bed , but she took the Things and went away between 12 and 1 , and took the Key of the Street Door away with her : the Till was broke open , and 12 s. and 6 d. was taken out ; there was no Body in the House but she and I Q . Did you owe her any Wages ? Lambert . She had her Wages before Hand : She had a Guinea of me , which was more than her Wages came to . Q . Had you any Recommendation of the Prisoner ? Lambert . Only from a Nurse that look 'd after a Child of mine . Q . Did you enquire for her , after this 27th of August ? Lambert . After she was gone , I spent much Time in enquiring after her . C. Why , you have indicted her for breaking open your House . Lambert . She took away the Key of the Door , she lock 'd me in , and her self out . - I was forc 'd to have the Lock broke in the Morning . C. Was there not a Suit commenced against you for her Wages , after she went away ? Lambert . Yes ; I was serv 'd with a Copy of a Writ from the Court of Common-Pleas She dropp 'd it one Term , and next Term they brought another . I employ 'd a Man to defend me , and he took my Money , but did not defend me . Q . Was it not after you had been serv 'd with this Action that you indict 'd her ? Lambert . I told her , before the Action was brought , that if she did not make Satisfaction for the Things taken away from me , I would have her before a Justice . Q . When was this ? Lambert . Soon after she went away from me . Q. I thought you said you could not find her . Lambert . I never saw her but once , and then I had no Warrant ; so I thought I had no Power to apprehend her . Q . Why , here was an Attorney prosecuting a Suit for her , how came it that you did not apply to him , to know where his Client was ? Lambert . I did enquire of the Attorney , and he said , 't was no Matter where she was , and they hid her from me . Q . Did not this Woman give Evidence on your Behalf in a Cause which was depending in the Court of Exchequer . Lambert No ; not in the Court of Exchequer . I never had any Prosecution with Regard to my Business , in the Court of Exchequer . I had an I format on against me 4 Years ago at the Excise-Office , and none since . She gave no Evidence for me . Q. I ask you , whether you have not apply 'd a second Time to her to give Evidence ? Lambert . Not on any such Account . She was with me at the other End of the Town - not at the Exchequer . It was on Account of a Dozen of Candles which a Man had of me , and 't was a Twelvemonth before he offer 'd to pay me . Q. I ask you , if you have not apply 'd to her as an Evidence ? Lambert . No other - than in speaking the Truth . She carry 'd the Candles . Q . When was this ? Lambert I am not sure whether 't was in June or July . I am sure it was not since she went away . When I desired her to give Evidence I did not threaten her , I only desired her to speak the Truth . A Woman . I know nothing of her robbing him ; only one Morning he asked me if I had seen his Servant ? and he asked me if she had brought any Thing to me ? I told him , she never brought any Thing to me in her Life . Another . I know nothing of the Robbery ; - she has been a little given to Drinking , and has us 'd him ill ; they used to quarrel . Defence . He had been up the Night before making Candles , and I thought he would not rise the next Day till late , so I having a little Business to do abroad , of my own , I opened the Shop about 7 o'Clock in the Morning , and clean 'd it out ; then I lock 'd the Street Door , and took the Key with me . I spoke to a Neighbour , and desired her to give an Eye to the House , telling her I expected no body but the Exciseman . I staid longer than I expected , before I could speak with the Person I wanted , and was afraid he would abuse me , as he often has done , when I went home . However , in the Evening I went home , and begged ten thousand Pardons for staying and carrying the Key with me , tho ' twas a Door that opens in Half , and I knew he could open it . He call 'd me drunken Bitch , and said I should come in no more . A Witness . I took the Prisoner Apprentice in 1704 She liv 'd with me ten Years as a covenant Servant , and since that she marry 'd our Gardiner , and has buried our Family ; latterly she has been a little given to Drinking . She is as honest a Woman , and as clean a clever Creature as lives . Another . Since the 27th of August I know she has been at Capt Wills 's at Ratcliff Cross Mrs. Wills . I know the Prisoner to be an honest Woman ; I have known her 12 Years When she came from Lambert 's she went to a Lodging in Brick-street ; since that , she liv 'd with me , and was taken out of my House in January last . She had been then with me a Fortnight , and was every Day up and down : I trusted her with every Thing in the House . A Woman . I have known her a Twelvemonth . She nursed me in my Lying in , and I trusted her with all the Keys of my Shop , and found her very honest . When she came from Lambert 's she came to me , and was with me five Weeks , and I sent her out on Errands every Day . She was openly every Day in my Shop . From my House she went to Madam Wills - Mrs. Wills . And she was with me till January last . Another Witness . The Prisoner is a very just honest Woman , and never was hid from him , but was up and down in the Streets to get her Bread . Lambert came once or twice to my House in Brick-street to ask for her , and she was never hid from him ; tho ' when he came to my House , she was out at Work ; yet she went by his Door every Day ; and as for this Felony , I never heard a Word of latterly . Lambert . I did seek after her , and spent Time and Money , but I could not find her . I have the Warrant in my Pocket . Q . When was it dated ? Lambert . It was last Sessions . A Witness . She was with me some Time , and Lambert has gone by divers Times when she was sitting at my Door with her Knitting . He has gone by divers Times on the other Side of the Way . A Man . Mr. Lambert was serv 'd with a Copy of a Writ , at Jane Clark 's Suit ; the particular Time I can not recollect , but 't was about 8 or 9 Months ago , and he employ 'd one king to defend him . This was about her Wages , and he told me he would give her a Guinea to make up the Matter . I went to her and offer 'd her that , but she refused to make it up . Q . At that Time when he offer 'd the Guinea , did he charge her with Felony ? The Witness . He said she had wronged him of many Things , but he did not say she had broke his House : He only said he had lost several Things , and he believ 'd she had taken them . He told me where she liv 'd ( in Brick street ) and I went to her Lodging ; I did not see her then , but she came a Day or two afterwards . C The Prosecutor is falsify 'd in many Instances by every one of these People . In order to convict this Woman of Burglary , and to take away her Life , he has forsworn himself . The Reason why he did not prosecute her before , he says , was because she absconded . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and the Court order 'd her a Copy of her Indictment . And , The Prosecutor was taken into Custody . 13. Charles Rogers , of St. Mary , White-chapel , was indicted for assaulting William Bassendine on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Ring with a blue Stone , value 2 d. a Handkerchief , value 2 d a Guinea , and 14 d. in Money , April 20 . Prisoner . My Lord , there 's only that Gentleman is to swear against me ; - do n't let those other Men come in ; - they know nothing at all of this Matter . William Bassendine . On the 20th of April last , between 12 and 1 o'Clock in the Morning . I was robbed six Doors from the Bagnio in Goodman 's Fields , by the Prisoner and two more . They came up to me with Pistols , which they clapp 'd to my right and left Breast , and cry 'd , d - n you , - your Money , Sir , you appear like a Gentleman , and we 'll use you as such . I told them I had but little Money , - what I had they were welcome to They bid me not make a Noise , for if I did they must shoot me ; so one of them put his Hand into my Pocket where the Guinea was , and I told them I would give them the Money The Prisoner took my Handkerchief , and put it into his Pocket , but he took it out again and said , Sir , your Handkerchief is of little Worth , so he returned it me again . After this the Prisoner took out my Deputation ( I belong to the Custom-House ) and he said , I believe , Sir , these are Writings ? I told them it would be of no Use to them , so they said they would not meddle with Notes or Writings . After this they felt in my Pockets again , and took the Ring with the Blue Stone : The Prisoner felt in my Fob , and took out two Notes , which he returned me . Q . How came you to know the Prisoner again ? Bassendine . I was very near Johnson 's Globe Lamps , about six Doors from the Bagnio , and tho ' the Prisoner had a flapp 'd Hat , yet the Brims were narrow , and as he stood fronting the Lamps , I saw his Face . They detained me five or six Minutes , and after they had rifled me , I said , Gentlemen , I beg the Favour of you to give me a Penny or Two-pence to cross the Water , and the Prisoner said to his Companions , - give the Gentleman a Couple of Pence , another of them said , - give the Gentleman Six-pence . I said , Gentleman , I am obliged to you , for it is late , and the Watermen generally insist one something extraordinary when it is late ; but another of them asked , whether it would bear ? I told them it would certainly bear Six-pence , for , says I , you have taken something very considerable from me , so they gave me Six-pence , and this is the very Piece of Money which they returned me . When we parted they charged me not to make any Noise , for if I did they would shoot me . Some Time after this I was sitting at a Barber 's in Lemon street , to be shaved , and I saw them go by ; I was so surpriz 'd , that the Barber took Notice of it , and asked me what was the Matter ? I told him those 3 Fellows were the Men who had robb 'd me . Upon that he went out 2 or 3 Doors after them , but I bid him not trouble himself about them ; then says he , if you wo n't trouble your self about them , you deserve to be robb 'd again ; so the Barber went after them to a Sheeps Head Shop , and when I heard they were there , I went to ask for some Dog 's Meat , that I might have an Opportunity of seeing them . They were at Dinner there , and I saw them ; so I went to Justice Farmer for a Warrant , and when I came back they were gone ; but we found them in the Glass-house Yard , on a vacant Place , among fourteen or fifteen Fellows , who were all playing their Rogues Tricks . When I seiz 'd the Prisoner , I could not be positive to the other two , so I charged a Constable with him only . Prisoner . He says my Hat had narrow Brims , - let him go up to Newgate , my Hat is in pawn there for Three Half-pence ; - there 's not a broader brimm 'd Hat in the whole Court than mine is . Q . Have you any People of the House here , where they din 'd ? Bassendine . No , they are People of ill Characters in the Neighbourhood . The Constable . Mr. Bassendine came to my House and shewed me his Deputation , and ordered me in the King 's Name to go with him and assist him . We went to Dallow 's Glass-house , and there we found about a Dozen or Fourteen Slender Carcass 'd Gentlemen , and he went up to the Prisoner , who was among them , and said , he was the Person who held a Pistol to his Breast ; so we carried him before Justice Farmer , and he sent him to Prison . The Prisoner deny 'd the Fact , but I have since heard that he has but a very Slender Character . A Witness . I was at Mr. Winstone 's , at Well-Close Square , and the Prosecutor came in , and asked Mr. Warrener , Justice Farmer 's Clerk for a Warrant ; he said he had seen three Men who had robb 'd him ; we asked him why he had not secured them ; he said he could not secure them without Assistance ; so Mr. Warriner sent for an Officer , but he not being at Home , he directed us to this Constable 's House , and we went to the Dunghill or Glass-house , where the Prosecutor fixed upon the Prisoner directly out of 14 or 15 Men . A Witness . I have known the Prosecutor many Years ; he is a Person of a good Character . Another . I have known him 16 Years ; he 's a Person of a good Character as far as I can hear . Prisoner . I have worked with a great many Gentlemen of Credit , in the Summer-Time , among the rest , with Dr. Edgerton , and in the Winter , I follow Coal-heaving : I was coming ( when I was taken ) to Goodman's-Fields , to get a little Victuals ; when the Prosecutor came into the Cook 's Shop where I was eating , the People laugh 'd at him , and I laughed at him too ; so he went away , and when I had din 'd I went up the Minories , - towards East Smithfield , and seeing some People upon the vacant Place , where the Glass House was , I stopp 'd , and the Gentleman seiz 'd me for the Robbery . If I had sent to the Lord Leicester or Dr. Edgerton . I could have had some Witnesses to my Character , but I have not , because I have no Money . C. But a Letter would have gone by the Post without Money . Prisoner . But I ca n't wait , nor have I any body to write for me ; and being innocent of the Fact , I thought I should have no Occasion . Prosecutor . Before we carry 'd him to Mr. Farmer we waited two Hours , for some body to speak for him , but he could get no body ; and when he came before Justice Farmer , the Justice cry 'd , - What ! are you come already ! Prisoner . I work for Mr. John Jackson , and Mr. John Richardson in Rosemary Lane The Court order 'd a Messenger to take the Prisoner 's Directions , and to find these People out , if possible , but the Messenger return 'd and declares there were no such Persons to be found . Prisoner . If you 'll send to my Sister , she will sa I was a-bed when the Gentleman was robb 'd . C. Aye , that 's another Sort of a Defence . Guilty . Death 14.

Richard Crew . On the 3d of Sept 1733 , I went to the King's-Arms at Fulham to the Nutting Feast , ( as 't is call 'd or nominated ) with some other People in Company , and there I staid till 6 of the Clock or better , then I came home by my self . When I came to the last House in Chelsea Road , call 'd the World 's End , I went in there and call 'd for a Pint of Beer ; while I was drinking , a Journeyman Baker came in , and drank with me , and we both came out of the House together . As we were going up the King 's Road , about 200 Yards from the World 's End , the Prisoner overtook us ; 't was then about 7 o'Clock or better ; he seemed to come along in a great Hurry , and I slipp 'd into a Ditch , endeavouring to make way for him ; he was very ready to help me out , and asked me if I was going to London ; I told him , Yes ; so we all three came together to the Tursntiles , - to the Walk where the Horse chesnut Trees grow ; here we went to drink , at the Sign of the King 's Head , and had two Pots of Beer ; we staid about an Hour and a quarter , and then we all set out again for London . Q . Was it dark when you went into the King 's Head ? Crew . There was a Candle brought into the Room , when we first went in . - From hence we proceeded to the narrow Passage that leads to the open Fields , next London , - they call them the five Fields ; when we came there the Baker bid us good Night , and went back again ; so the Prisoner and I went on by our selves , and after we had passed over one Field , we met the Patrole of Chelsea-College Pensioners , with their Arms . One of the old Men begg 'd of us to give him a Dram , and told us , there was a Man in the Ditch who could let us have a Dram of any Thing : I treated them with a Dram , and after they had drank it , one of them took up the Candle and Lanthorn of the Man that sold the Liquor , and held it up to both our Faces ; he look 'd in our Faces , and we look 'd in his . Then we went on to the Duke of Buckingham 's Pallisades , and there he told me 't was too late to go over the Park , but I might go by Hyde Park Corner ; I agreed , and as we were going along , he took hold of a Stick which I had in my Hand , ( but not in a violent Manner ) and I let him take it ; so we walked a little farther together , - I was on his Right Hand next the Wall , and all on a sudden he put me on the Left Hand next the Ditch , and we walked 10 or 12 Yards farther , then he turn 'd about and said , Sir , I must have what you have got about you , and he rushed both his Hands so violently into my Waistcoat Pockets , that he tore this Flap almost down to the bottom . He took my Handkerchief and some Half-pence ; then he rifled my Breeches , and took out 2 crooked Sixpences and some Half-pence ; about 19 or 20 d in all . While he was rifling me , I said , Friend , do you know what you are doing ? D - n you , says he , do n't speak so loud , and out he pull 'd a Pistol , and clapp 'd it to my Breast : Then he took my Hat , and gave me his in Exchange , and then he left me as fast as he could : I suppose he perceived 2 or 3 Men coming up , or else he would have taken my Coat ; for when the Men came up they told me they met a Man , running as if the Devil was in him . Q . What are the Names of these Men ? Are they to be produced ? Crew . I do n't know any Thing of them . On the Wednesday after I was robb 'd , I went to the Baker , and he , ( after some Talk ) told me he was inform 'd the Man that robb 'd me liv 'd somewhere about Turnham Green , and that his Wife keeps a Chandler 's Shop , and that he was a Yorkshire Man . I went to enquire after him , but finding no such Person , I left a Direction in Writing with the Baker , where he might find me , if he should hear any Thing of him . Q . Is that Baker here ? Crew No , he 's gone to the East-Indies ; but before he went , ( 't was in November 1734 ) I saw the Baker in the Street , and he told me he had seen the Man that robb 'd me , leaning over a Hatch at Putney . and that he was informed he liv 'd at the House where he saw him . Upon this Information I went to the House , but could not find him , so I left a Warrant at Putney to seize him when he should appear , but he was not taken 'till the Night we had the Storm of Thunder and Lightning , - the 16th of this Instant . Q . What House does he keep at Putney ? Crew 'T is a little private House ; I believe his Mother is the House-keeper . When he was taken up , I was sent for , and I knew him again , and that 's the Man upon my Oath . Q . The Baker gave you this Information in 1734 , how came you not to take him in all this while ? Crew . He was not to be seen by any Body . Prisoner . How long was I in Company with you from first to last ? Crew About an Hour and a half . C. I believe you may be right in that , for you have been an Hour in telling the Story . Prisoner . Ask him if he was not in Liquor when this happened ? Crew . No , I remember 'd every Penny I spent , and where I spent it . Let me see , - three half Crowns when I went out . Spent at Fulham 4 s. - In the Morning 8 d. - King 's Head , 6 d. - World's-End , 3 d - Drams in the Ditch , 1 d Halfpenny , and some Money I lent my Companions , I ca n't justly tell what . Hen Mascall The 6th of this Month , John Bolton came to me between 10 and 11 at Night , and asked me to assist him in taking a Highwayman , and told me , 't was the Man that marry 'd Farmer 's Daughter , that we were to seize ; so we went out and saw him before us , I took hold of him by the Collar , and in a Minute Bolton came up to my Assistance I told him he was a Highwayman , and was my Prisoner , and upon that he immediately turned himself a little and snapp 'd a Pistol in my Face ; it did not go off , but the Flash burnt my Eye-brows I call 'd him murdering Dog , and Bolton wrung it out of his Hand Then we gave him 2 or 3 Knocks , and in searching him , another Pistol dropp 'd out of his Pocket upon my Foot ; they were both loaded with Ball , and the Pistols were squared or notched in the Nossels , that the Bullets when the Pistols were fired would come out Slugs . We carried him to Justice Pettiward 's , and while we stood with him in the Fore Court , he dropp 'd a little Leather Purse with Balls in it , and half a Horn of Gunpowder . Q . How long have you known the Prisoner at Putney ? Mascall . I never had much Knowledge of him ; nor have I seen him a great while I do n't know that ever I saw him out of Doors before that Night in my Life : I have seen him lean over the Hatch sometimes ; and he always had a white Napkin about his Head . 'T is a Year and half since the Warrant was taken out against him . I never saw him drest , ( except this Time ) in all my Life . John Bolton confirm 'd Mascal 's Evidence . Tho Mascal About 2 Years and a half ago , I had a Warrant against the Prisoner for this Robbery , and I searched the House where he dwelt , and look 'd after him a great many Times , but could never find him . Several other Witnesses were ready to give Evidence to the same Purpose , but they were not call 'd . Prisoner . I desire that Crew 's Information may be read . Mr. James Cook . This was Mr . Crew 's Information , taken from him Word for Word , and almost Literatim . The Information of Richard Crew of Great Swan-Alley , Calender-Man taken this 8th of May 1737. Who says , that he went with several others from London to the King's-Arms at Fulham , to the Nutting Feast the 3d of September 1733. and that he stay 'd there 'till 6 o'Clock , then left his Company and came towards London , that he fell into Company with Thomas Meighill , and came with him to the King 's Head at the Corner of the five Fields , and that between that Place and the Infirmary , the Prisoner stopt the Informant at the Corner of Hyde-Park , under the Wall , the Prisoner stopp 'd the Informant , and said , he must have what he had got about him , and then putting a Pistol to this Informant 's Breast , he took from him a new Silk Handkerchief , and about 20 d. in Money , 2 crooked Six-pences , which the Informant remembers were in his Pocket ; and his Hat , almost new , which he exchanged for his old one , and that he made this Informant pull a Buckle out of his Shoe , to see if it was Silver , but it not being Silver , he return 'd it to this Informant .

[ Transportation . See summary . ] 48,49. Ann Wilson , and Mary Solomon , were indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 3 l. from the Person of William Glasspool . May 1 . Glasspool . Between 10 and 11 o'Clock at Night , the first of May , I was coming thro ' Whitechappel to my Lodgings in Billiter-Lane , and I met with Mary Solomon , that little Girl at the Bar , and she desired me to give her a Glass of Liquor ; the other ( Wilson ) perswaded me to go to their Lodging . I went with them , and when I got into the House I gave them a Shilling to get a full Pot of Flip : While we were drinking the Flip Wilson got her Hands about my Waist , under my Cloaths , and drew my Watch out of my Fob . I seized her Hand with the Watch in it ; she dropp 'd it down , and I took it up again and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket , and told them , I would stay no longer with them , because I saw they had a Mind to defraud me of my Watch . Wilson rapp 'd out an Oath , and assur 'd me , she scorn 'd to use any Gentleman so ill ; so I staid a quarter of an Hour longer , and she got about me again , and took the Watch out of my Pocket and gave it the little one ( Solomon ) who stood behind Wilson and me . 'T is true , I did not see her , but I felt her , and my Watch could go no other Way ; beside , I saw her push her Hand by my Side , towards Solomon . Q . Did you and Wilson sit together ? Glasspool . We were upon the Bed together . - She and I were upon the Bed's-Feet . She threw her self upon the Bed's-Feet , and swore I should - have to do with her , and so she pull 'd me upon the Bed to her , and as we lay together I felt her take the Watch , and saw her push her Hand by my Side , towards Solomon , who stood behind us at the Feet of the Bed . I would have got up immediately , but she had got her Arms about me , and held me fast , that I might not pursue Solomon . However , I made shift to slip out of her Arms , and I ran after Solomon ; I saw her go into the next House , and a Jew being at the Door , I said , Sir , I have lost my Watch , and the Woman that has got it , is come into this House ; and tho ' I saw her go into the House with my own Eyes , yet the Jew would face me down , that no body was come in there . Wilson . When you found the Watch drawing out of your Pocket , pray why did not you lay hold of it ? Glasspool . 'T was done so suddenly , that I had not Time . - I stood at the Jew 's Door a quarter of an Hour , and then she came out and run into another House ; and while I was waiting at this Door , Wilson came out with her Petticoats over her Head , and went into the House where Solomon now was . I got into this House , and here they offer 'd to be searched . John Bradshaw . I saw Wilson and Solomon in the Cage at Whitechappel the 2d of May : I told Nan , she had made good Haste to get in here , when I saw her at her own Door last Night at past Ten o'Clock ; for when she was before Justice Philips , she said she had not been out all Night . Thomas Broadway . Glasspool was at my House that Night about Ten o'Clock , and he had his Watch when he went away . The little Girl has got a Husband , one Solomon ( a Jew ) and he came to me and said , if the Man would not prosecute , he should have his Watch again . Wilson . The Man told me when he and we were together , that he had been in Company with some Women , and had lost his Watch . He wanted me to be concerned with him in a very sad , ugly Thing which I am ashamed to speak of , and because I would not consent , he said he would swear it upon me . He was very troublesome in our Court , and call 'd Watch , Watch , and I got a Watchman and a Constable to get him home . James Hill . Wilson lived at the Waterman's-Arms , St. Mary Overies Stairs . ( I come to give her a Character . ) After that she liv 'd at the African Coffee-House ; she behav 'd well , and was a clean Girl . Judith Hyde . Nan Wilson was a Servant with me , about 4 or 5 Years ago . I never heard but that she behaved well , till this Time . Mary Snapes . I never heard Ill of her before . John Bradshaw .

I live at the Sign of the Angel in Charles Street , Westminster . On the 3d of May I was going Home , and at the End of King Street , this Gentlewoman addressed her Compliments to me , and I used some to her , and so she pick 'd my Pocket . I charg 'd a Constable with her , and she charg 'd the Constable with me ; we were both carry 'd to the Watch-house that Night , and the next Morning she was committed to Newgate ; then she said , she wish 'd it had been 2 Guineas instead of 2 Shillings . Q . Did not you do something you should not have done ? Pricket . I did nothing at all - she 's one of the Street Walkers , and there was another Woman with her , but she pick 'd my Pocket . She asks whether I did not give it her , - no , - what should I give it her for ? - she took it . Prisoner . I went to a Brandy-shop with him in King street , and he call 'd for a Quartern of Gin , and then he went up the Passage with the other Woman , and stay 'd so long there , that I went away : Afterwards I met him with Moll Davis in King street , and he charged me with taking his Money . He 's a Man of no Character , - he cries Puddings about the Streets . Pricket Well ! - my Lord , I 'll tell you the down-right Truth of the Matter . I li't into this Woman 's Company , and she ask 'd me to do - so and so . I had no Thoughts of it , - not I , but she perswaded me to it , so I gave her 6 d. out of my Purse : Afterwards I wanted & c & c. - but she would have 6 d more ; I refused to give her t'other 6 d. so she put her Hand in my Pocket and took it all . There was no Moll Davis with me , - she took it herself . Acquitted . 54. Robert Wilson , was indicted for that he on the 25th of March , in the 8th Year of his Majesty 's Reign , at the Parish of St. Sepulchre 's , took to Wife Eleanor Steel , and afterwards , viz . on the 21st of Oct . last , in the Parish of St. Sepulchre 's he took to Wife Mary Benham , and to her was then and there married , his former Wife being then alive . John Crossby . I know the Prisoner was marry 'd to Steel , I was present when that Affair was transacted . They were marry 'd at a Brandy-shop at the Fleet , the Ceremony was perform 'd by a Man in a Night Gown ; whether he was a Parson or not , I ca n't tell . He pull 'd a Book out of his Pocket , and read a little Bit of it to them . Q . Were the most material Parts of the Office read ? Crossby . No , not all the Particulars of it ; but he read some of it , and then told them they were marry 'd . I am sure he did not read half so much as was read to me at Pancras when I was marry 'd . Q . Was there a Ring ? Crossby . Yes , there was a Ring , but I do n't know whether the Words , - I take you to be my Wife , and I take you to be my Husband , were said . In 2 or 3 Days after the Wedding , she went down to see her Friends in Cumberland , and there she was deliver 'd of a Child , and left it there . Q . How long did she stay in Cumberland ? Crossby . She went down 2 or 3 Days after the Wedding , which was in March , and she sta 'd 'till November . After she came from Cumberland they liv 'd together as Man and Wife 'till last June . They lodg 'd in my House , and he acknowledged her publickly for his Wife , and she own 'd him as her Husband ; they both went by the same Name . Q . How came they to part ? Crossby . Why , after he had marry 'd her , he found she was with Child , so that occasion 'd the first Breach , and was the Reason of her going to Cumberland immediately after the Wedding . When he found how it was , he call 'd me up into the Room , and told me of it ; she was crying in Bed , and asking his Pardon ; she told him if he would forgive her , she would be one of the best of Wives . Q . After this did he leave her ? Crossby . No , she left him ; she took away what Effects of his she could get , and took Passage with some Men for New England , but he found her out , and one of the Men was try 'd here last July Sessions . * * James English , was try 'd for stealing several Things , the Property of Robert Wilson , in July Sessions , 1736. and acquitted . See Sessions Book , No VI . 1736. p. 154. Will Seymour . I was by when the Prisoner was marry 'd to his second Wife ( Benham ) . They were marry 'd ( as they call it ) at the Fleet , by an old Fellow in a black Gown , at an Ale-house . The Parson said they were marry 'd , but I am sure they were not marry 'd as I was ; the Parson 's Wife lent them a Ring to put upon the Bride 's Finger . Q . Did she say , she took him for her Husband , and he - her for his Wife ? Seymore . Yes , and he acknowledged her for his Wife ; this was some Time last Winter , - If I had thought I should have been call 'd upon to come here , I am sure , I would not have been at the Wedding . Ann TaHowgreen . I was at Benham 's Wedding ; the Ceremony was read over to them , and a Ring was put upon her Finger ; they afterwards liv 'd together as Man and Wife . Q . Is Steel living ? Crossby . Yes ; here she is ; this is she , my Lord . Prisoner I know nothing of the Marriage with Benham ; she nursed me when I had a Fever , and she told me I should get somebody to take Care of me constantly ; I told her I had somebody that call 'd me Husband , and she told me , - as long as she was gone away with other Men , I was divorced by the Laws of God and Man . So I met her one Day , when I was a little out of the way , a little in Liquor , and they got me to an Alehouse , but whether I was marry 'd or no I can not tell ; indeed she told me we were marry 'd , and we liv 'd together afterwards . I did go with my first Wife to be marry 'd , but what Sort of a Marriage it was , God knows ; she left me and went away with other Men the 26th of June last . Mary Crossby . I never knew him but an honest Man , till this happen 'd ; the first Woman and he liv 'd together as Man and Wife Benham knew he had a Wife when she marry 'd him , but I have heard her say before she was marry 'd , that if ever she came in Company with him , she would clap her Arms about him , and would never leave him nor forsake him . I know she interceeded with the first Wife to go away , that she might prevail with him for a Maintenance . A Witness . Benham told me , she would endeavour to get the first Wife 's Name out of the Books ; for , says she , I am starving and want a Maintenance . She 's but an indifferent Sort of a Person . Guilty .

On the 15th of December I lost a Silver Pint Mug ; the Prisoner had been drinking out of it , and as soon as ever he was gone , I miss 'd it . There had been another Man drinking , in the Room at the same Time out of another , and I suppose when the Man was gone , he gave me the Man 's Mug , and went away with that which he had his own Drink in . Q . How do you know the Mug the Prisoner drank out of from the other ? Stevenson . The Prisoner drank out of an upright Mug , the other was a belly 'd one . As soon as the Prisoner was gone , a Man came in for a Pint of Beer , and I then miss 'd it . I found the Prisoner on the 3d of March , and took him up on Suspicion , and carry 'd him before Justice Margett 's , who discharged him , because I could not swear he stole it . As we were coming from the Justice 's , I said , now you are discharged you may tell me where the Mug is ; well then ( says he ) come along with me ; so he carry 'd me to Degan 's a Pawnbroker , where he had pawn 'd it for 45 s. and there I paid 48 s. 4 d. The Prisoner asked for the Mug , and 't was produced directly ; here it is - the very same that I lost , and found again at Dogan 's . Edward Dogan . The prisoner I have known many Years , he brought me this Mug one Evening to pawn , and I lent him 45 s. upon it ; I ca n't swear this is the very same , but 't was much such an old-fashion 'd Thing as this . I do believe this is it , and my Servant told me that Stevenson and the Prisoner had it out together . Q . How come you to remember what Sort of a Mug the Prisoner drank out of , at this Distance of Time ? Stevenson . I drew him the Beer my self in this upright Mug . Q . How came you to recollect this ? You say he gave you a different Mug at the Time you charge this Fact upon him . Why did not you ask him then , for the same Mug you drew him the Beer in ? Stevenson . Because I did not mind it , till after he was gone . Several People appear 'd to the Prisoner 's Character . Acquitted . 58.

John Ayres . Killcup was convicted last sessions for stealing this Lead ; he inform 'd me where it was sold , and went with me to Birch 's House , and ask 'd for it , Birch 's Wife at first deny 'd it , and told me her Husband should come to me about it In the Afternoon ; but instead of coming himself , his Apprentice and a Woman came and perswaded me not to give him Trouble . When he was taken up , he confessed he bought it , and told me 't was his Method , when he bought such Things , to cut them to Pieces and carry them away ; then he inform 'd me where he had sold this , and beg 'd I would not prosecute him . Q . What did he give for it ? Ayres . A Penny a Pound . Juryman . That 's pretty near the Market Price . Ayres . He begg 'd I would not prosecute him , and said , he had but just got out of such another troublesome Affair . Spencer Burges . When the Prisoner was taken up , he own 'd he had bought the Lead , and said , he was sorry he had done such a Thing , and begg 'd he might not be prosecuted , and he told us further , that whenever he bought any Thing in this Way , he always got rid of it as soon as he could . Prisoner . Mr. Ayres hir 'd that Man for a Shilling to swear against me . My Wife bought the Lead , I know nothing at all of it .
