And when they were taken their Swords were Bloody ; F - said that he had killed a Dog , and after said that he had never cleaned his Sword since he was at a Fight beyond Sea near Fleury , but that was a double Story ; and it was proved that he was in company with the Deceased at Chelsey the same day that the Murther was done , and the Deceased 's Shirt , and one of the Swords of the Prisoners , was produced in Court as a further Testimony against them , though the matter appeared very Strenuous and Pregnant before , even in all the Circumstances of it .

The Bond was fully proved to be the same for that they had ingenuously Forged Falknor 's hand . There were abundance of Circumstances that attended the Cheat , for two Papers of Pattricks own Hand writing , containing a true Confession of the whole matter , were produced in Court , how that B - came to him , and told him , That he should Personate one Swayne , and that Falconer and his Wife were dead , and could not contradict the Bond ; and that he should say , That Swayne lent the Mony in such a place , at such a time , to the said Falconer , and that Lewis was also concerned in the whole Series of the Trick , and that he filled up the Bond with his own hand ; but Lewis denyed the Fact firstly , and was very Peremptory in his Behaviour .

The Indictments against them consisted of Two Parts , the First of which set forth , That they had a Treasonable Design carrying on to Depose the King and Queen , and to Subvert and Alter the Government of the Kingdom of England , and to raise War and Rebellion in the same ; which said Traiterous and Wicked Designs and Purposes to bring to pass , they did , on the 29th of December last , Meet and Conspire together , withseveral other Traitors not yet discovered , and did Compose several Treasonable Letters , Notes and Memorandums in writing , which set forth the most effectual way and means how they might Dethrone and Depose our Most Gracious Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen , and further describing therein how the Affairs of this Kingdom stood , and of what Strength and Force our Shipping was ; as also the Fortifications of several Sea-Port-Towns within this Kingdom . The Second Part was their adhering to the Kings 's Enemies : And to that end , that they might Acquaint Lewis the French King of the same , they did hire a Boat and Embarque themselves in order to Transport themselves and Pacquet of Treasonable Letters into France , agreeing to pay for their said Passages the Sum of One hundred Pound ; and , in order to their Treasonable Voyage , they had made their Passage as far as below Gravesend , but were then Taken by Captain Billop , who Cruised abroad to search for them . After this the Evidence for the King being called , gave an Account particularly from Step to Step , how cunningly and subtilly they managed this horrid Conspiracy , by hiring the Smack called the Thomas and Elizabeth , to convey them secretly into France ; in order to which they took Water in a Skuller at Surrey-Stairs , and went on Board the aforesaid Vessel , which lay in the River of Thames over against the Tower : From thence they set Sail down the River , till coming within the View of the George Frigate , lying in Long-reach , they desired the Master of the Smack to hide them under the Quarter-Hatches ; which was done , they having some Fear of being discovered : There they remained till past that Danger , and then came up ; but when they were within Sight of Gravesend they hid again , and a little below it Captain Billop came aboard them , under Pretence of Pressing the Masters two Men , who were assistants to him ; but indeed his Design and real Intention was to find out those Traytors , which , upon Search , he found lying along under the Hatches ; and after their being haled up he search 'd them , and found a Pacquet of Treasonable Papers in Mr. Ashton 's Bosom : which he with the Prisoners carried before my Lord Nottingham ; who examined the Papers , and after being examined by the Cabinet Council they were committed to the Tower . The Evidence was very full and plain against them both , much to the same effect and purport : The Letters being also Read against them in Court , were adjudged to be of no less Import than High-Treason .
