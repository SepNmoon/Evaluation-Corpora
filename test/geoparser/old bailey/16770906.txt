With Permission . Ro . L'Estrange . LONDON : Printed for D. M. 1677 . The Proceedings at the Sessions for London and Middlesex THe first person that received Trial this Sessions , was a young Woman for the horrid Crime of Murder , charged to have been unnaturally committed on her own Female bastard Child , on the 17th of July last : She had been for some time suspected to be with child , but it did not appear any body had burthen 'd her therewith . She was delivered alone , and had laid the Child in a Trunk ; but being very sick , a woman ( at whose house she lay ) upon some suspicion sent for a Midwife , who declaring that she had had a Child , the now Prisoner at last confest it , and they found it lockt up in the Trunk as aforesaid . The Prisoner alleadged it was still-born , and upon view of the Body there did not appear the least mark of wound , bruise , or other violence used : So that thereupon , and her voluntary Confession , & c. the Jury not believing that she had actually murdered the Infant , brought her in Not guilty . A common Thievish Wench , that followes the trade used by too many of them , viz . pretend to want Services , and have no sooner got a place , but at the first opportunity they rob their Masters or Mistresses , was Arraigned and found Guilty of stealing 5 l. in Money , and a great quantity of laced Linnen , & c. from a Gentleman , whom she had lived with but 3 or 4 days , who being above stairs with his Wife and some friends , near 10 of the Clock , she broke open a Closet-door below , took this Money and the Goods , and so leaving all the Doors open , march 'd off with the Booty ; not being heard of till upon another exploit , she had taken up her quarters in Newgate , having but just before she came to this Gentlemans Service ; been discharged out of another Goal , where she had been committed for the like practice . A lusty Man took a long Tryal for a supposed Rape by him committed on a certain woman , who swore positively , that on Sunday the 22th of July last the Prisoner came ine Forenoon to her Lodging , whilst her Husband was at Church , pretending to pay for something he had formerly had , and ( amongst other things ) courted her to go abroad over the water with him that Afternoon ; who refusing unless her Husband went too , he at last on a sudden flung her on the bed , and there by violence against her consent had his will of her , and left her in a Swoon , & c. But it appearingthat she did not cry out , for which she alledged a pleasant reason , that she could not , or was not able ; and being demanded why , answered , because he laid his face so hard upon hers . So that neither a woman that was in another room of the same house , nor another in the next house that could hear any considerable noise made in this womans Room , heard the least disturbance . As also that the Witness dined with her Husband that day , without complaining of the abuse , or unusual disorder ; and the same afternoon met the prisoner by accident at a Relations house of hers , and never charged him , or took any notice of it ; nor acquainted her husband till next morning . After a strict sifting of the matter , the Jury thought fit to bring in the prisoner Not guilty , to the great satisfaction of his friends there present ; the man having a good repute among his neighbours . A Gentleman took his Tryal for killing another Gentleman in the Strand on the 7th of July , and whose body was found dead there next day in an Alley . They were wholly strangers to one another ; but the party deceased being near Twelve a clock at night got into the Alley with his sword drawn , and swearing to run a Maid servant through as she went home , with whom he had not the least pretence of quarrel ; She prayed the prisoner , who was also a stranger to her , to guard her home ; who did so ; but in his return it seems a Rencounter happen 'd , and the deceased was kill 'd ; but that it was doneby the prisoner , the greatest Evidence was , that his Sword agreed with the figure of the wound , and was stain 'd with blood just as far as that was deep ; so that the prisoner was convicted of Manslaughter . One that had been servant to a Gentleman about old-ford in Middlesex , was Indicted for stealing two Geldings , a Black and a Bay , out of his Master 's Grounds . But riding with them along the Road in Hertford shire , an honest Warder questioning him , and finding cause of suspition , seized him ; who upon Examination before a Justice of Peace confess 'd they were his Master 's horses . To whom , upon notice thereof sent , they were returned , and the prisoner now Convicted . A Good man had the luck to lose at once both his Bed and Bed-fellow : and some time after , upon search , found the former at a Broker 's . He now Indicted a woman ( the Broker ) for his said bed , and breaking open his house . But it rather appearing that she took it in for a Pawn , and that by all circumstances the Burglary was committed in his own Family , the prisoner was Acquitted . A woman was burnt in the hand for a Robbery committed by her Two years ago , when coming to a house where there was no body left within but an antient poor woman , she pretended to send her out of an Errand at several Streets distance , promising to give her six pence , & c. but whilst she was gone , ransackt thehouse , and took away Goods , Apparel , & c. to a considerable value . A Servant-wench Indicted for a Burghlary and robbing her Master : It appeared by her own Confession and otherwise , that she opened the door in the Night to some of her Confederates , that robbed all the lower part of the house ; and for a colour that she might not be suspected as privy to it , broke down a piece of a Wall backwards ; but it happening to rain , their Footsteps were trac 'd from the fore-door , and none on the back-side at all . Before the Justice she confessed she let them in , and that it was her father and her brother ; but upon enquiry , 't is found she has no brother , and that her father died several years ago . At Bar she denied any Confederacy , alleadging that she knew nothing of it , yet was found guilty ; and being askt what she had to say , why sentence of Death should not pass against her according to Law , prayed Transportation . The Court promised her mercy , if she would discover who the felons were ; but she refused , alleadging she could not , being then in bed asleep . A Man married about 10 years ago to a Woman in the Country , having about 3 year since married another at Aldgate ( the first being still living ) was for the same Arraigned : His first Wives Sister proved the first Marriage , and that they lived together and had two Children . The second Wives Father and Mother proved their Daughters Marriage to him , and that he had a Portion , which was consumed , & c. He had little to say for himself , but being found Guilty , craved the benefit of his Clergy , and by special Order hath Squire Ketches Arms very fairly engraven in his Hand . There was great expectation of another Trial , but the same was put off till next Sessions . There were two Women and two Men Burnt in the Hand , and three that begged Transportation . And so concluded Maiden Sessions .
