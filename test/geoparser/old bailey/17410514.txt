Isaac Mather . The Prisoner was my Servant . and having lost several Things , I suspected that she conveyed them out of my House , and taxed her with it ; upon which she acknowledged the taking as many of the Goods as she could recollect at that Time , and carried us to Mrs. Messenger 's in Hounsditch , where she had pawned them . Q . When she was charged with taking these Things , what did she say in Excuse of herself ? Mr. Mather . I asked her what Reason she had to rob me , and she said she was in Debt , and was apprehensive of being arrested ; that she had an Uncle of whom she expected some Money , and then she intended to redeem them .

On the 2d of May I went with the Prisoner to the Pawnbrokers , and found some of these Things ; and on looking over my Linen I missed 2 Shirts , which I afterwards found in the Custody of the Constable .

April 12 . John Wall . On Saturday the 11th of April , I had Business which called me out into the City to several Places , where I staid 'till between one and two o'Clock in the Morning , and as I was going past the end of Salisbury-Court in Fleet-street , in my way Home , I met 3 Persons who seemed to stand in a Conference together : I passed them , and when I came to Fetter-Lane , I found myself by them again , and presently the Prisoner was even with me . I turn 'd up Bell-Yard as my nearest way Home ; the Prisoner followed me , and we went together 'till we came very near the Top of the Yard ; then he catched hold of my Coat with one Hand , and with the other he pulled a short Stick out of his Bosom , and with Imprecations demanded my Money . Immediately he fell on me with his Stick and repeated his Blows so fast on me , that if he had not held me up by my Coat , I must have fallen to the Ground . Upon this I cryed out Watch ! but none being near , I seized him myself and then he cried out a Sodomite , but some People coming to my Assistance , we were both secured and sent to Prison together . John Tenant . I am a Watchman in St. Clement 's Parish , and hearing Watch called several Times , I turned out of great Sheer Lane to see what was the the Matter , and then I saw much such a Man as the Prisoner lying over the Prosecutor with a short Stick : I asked him why he did so , and the Man said the Prosecutor was a Sodomite , and still kept beating him with his Stick , and in a few Minutes the Stick was found on the Ground . Upon this I laid hold of the Man , and when he found that I was going to take him away , he charged me with the Prosecutor , and I delivered them both to a Watch-man belonging to the Roll 's Liberty and went back to my Stand . Prisoner . Did the Prosecutor at that Time say that I attempted to rob him ? Tenant . No , he desired the Prisoner might be stopped , but I heard nothing of a Robbery . DEFENCE . Prisoner . I had been drinking in the Stand , and turned up Bell Yard in order to go Home : this Man met me , and we jostled together ; upon which he pulled out a Stick and knocked me down several Times , and the Constable coming up , asked me what I had lost ? I told him my Wig , and insisted on Satisfaction for it , but he would not give me any , and so we were both committed to Prison together . He knocked me down several Times , and I am sure he is put upon this Prosecution for the Sake of the Reward * . * There is no Reward at all in Cases of this Nature . Tenant . The Prisoner did not say that the Prosecutor had struck him , neither did he charge him with his Wig . Mary Collins . I have known the Prisoner several Years , and never heard any Thing unhandsom of him in my Life . His Father is a Picture Frame maker , and he has follow 'd that Business 'till this Time .

Elizabeth ( the wife of Arthur ) Roberts , was indicted for assaulting Cassandra Graham on the King 's Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Stuff-petticoat , value 2 s. the Goods of the said Cassandra , April 12 . Cassandra Graham was called , but was of so tender an Age , that it was not thought proper she should be sworn . Margaret Adams . Last Tuesday was three Weeks , the Child came into my Yard , and said , that a Woman who was running up the Road had robbed her . We pursued her , and she mended her pace , and ran half way up the Road , till she came to a green Meadow which is paled in , and then I saw her throw something over the pals . I did not stay to see what it was , but continued the pursuit , and just as she got to the Turnpike which leads to Pimlico , she was taken . Mary Edmonds . I was in the same Yard , when the Child came in crying , and said she was robbed . We all ran out , and saw that there was no person in the Road but the Prisoner , and I saw that the thing which she flung into the Meadow was green . We did not stay to take it up , but I laid hold of the Prisoner , and carried her into a House , and soon afterwards the Child 's Coat was brought in , and I believe it to be the very same which I saw the Prisoner throw out of her Hand . Jury . Have you ever seen the Child wear that Coat ? Edmonds . Yes , several Times , and she was without it when she came into the Yard . Jury . Do you believe that was the Thing which the Prisoner threw from her ? Edmonds . Yes , I am sure it is the Child 's petticoat , and I saw it taken out of the Meadow by a little Boy . Thomas Hopkins . I was Constable . The Child 's Uncle brought the Prisoner and this petticoat to me , about half an Hour after she was taken , and I carried her before a Justice . Richard Wilkinson . I know the petticoat to be the Girl 's , and am certain she had it on when she went out of my House , about a Quarter of an Hour before this happened . Prisoner . I did not take the Coat , but pick 'd it up , as I was going along ; and when the Mob rose upon me , I threw it away . Guilty Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5. Vincent Sunmonds , of St. Ann 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing 4 Yards of Callimanco , value 5 s. and 20 pieces of Leather , value 10 s. the goods of William Dean , April 24 . Mr. Dean . The Prisoner was my servant . On the 24th of April , we were together in my Shop , and he went up Stairs with some Goods to a Warehouse , which I have , and while he was there , I had occasion to go up after him . When I got into the Room , he seem 'd to be in a great Flutter , and would not stand upright ; however I pulled him upright , and then this Callimanco drop 'd from his Clothes : I said , you Villain , have you robbed me ? and he did not speak a Word ; so I brought him down into the Shop , and asked him , why he gave himself up to such practices ? and desired him to inform me , if he had robbed me of any Thing else , and how he had disposed of it . As to the Callimanco , he said , he took that to give away to somebody , but he would not tell me who that somebody was . I then asked him , if he had taken any thing else , and he said ; if he informed me , perhaps he should not be used the better for it . I kept him some time in my Shop , and then carried him before a Magistrate , and when we were there , we thought it might be proper to search his Lodgings ; but he declared he had nothing there of mine : We were not willing to take his Word , so I and the Constable searched his Lodgings , and found these pieces of Leather , some of which I can swear to be mine . I asked the Prisoner , if these were not mine ? and he said , they did not all belong to me , for he had bought some of a Leather-cutter in Maiden-lan ; but that Leather-cutter being sent for , said , the Prisoner had bought of him some Time ago , but that none of those peices were ever his . Prisoner . My Master sent me up into the Warehouse , and the Stick fell out of this Callimanco , and I took it in order to roll it up again , and he came up and said I had an Intent to rob him . As to the Leather , I had it by me , and worked for my own Customers before I lived with him . Mary Rawlins . I have known the Prisoner ever since he was born , and never heard any body say , that he was guilty of the least Indiscretion or Injustice . Susannah Morcan . I have known him ever since he was three or four Years old , and never knew him guilty of any Thing in Life . John Mascal . I have known him from his Infancy , and never knew him to be guilty of any Thing 'till this unhappy Affair . Nathaniel Porter . I have known him about six Years ; he lodged with me a Year and half , and I always found him honest . Mark Catesby . I have known him eight Years ; he has been my Bed-fellow these twelve Months , and I never saw any Ill of him in my Life . William Rawlins . He served his Time with a Relation of mine , and bore a very good Character ; and I can hardly think he would be guilty of a Fact of this Nature . Guilty , 4 s. 6 d. [ Branding . See summary . ] 6. William Sykes , was indicted for stealing a Drab-Coat , value 10 s. and a German Serge Coat , value 10 s. the Goods of John Heart , April 13 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7. Elizabeth Bennet , of St. James Westminster , was indicted , for that she , on the 13th Day of April , being big with a certain female Child , afterwards , the said Child , by the Providence of God , alone and secretly she did bring forth alive ; which said female Child , by the Laws of this Realm , was a Bastard ; and that she , not having God before her Eyes , & c. as soon as born , on the said female Child , so alive , & c. did make an Assault , and then and there did take the said female Child , in both her Hands , and the said Child into a certain privy , belonging to Richard Lucas , & c. did cast and throw ; by reason of which casting and throwing , the said Child was choaked and suffocated ; of which choaking and suffocating , it instantly died . She was a second time charged , by virtue of the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the said Murder . Elizabeth Lucas . On the 13th of April , between 8 and 9 in the Morning , the Prisoner came into my House , and said , she was very ill of the Colick , and wanted to go backwards . She sat some time in the Room , seemingly very uneasy , and then went backwards . She came in again presently , and walked about the Room , complaining that she was very ill , and said , if I had a Room and a Bed to spare , she would go to Bed ; so I desired my Husband to ask our Lodger to resign her Room , but she would not . After this , the Prisoner walked about the Room some Time , and then went backwards a second time ; and she staying longer than I expected , I followed her , and perceived that the Necessary-house had been washed : I asked her the reason of it , and she said , her Nose had bled . As to the Child , I saw nothing of it . The Prisoner lodged with me before this , and I took her for a single person , and a very sober good Woman . Prisoner . What Distance of Time was there , from my going to the Little-house , and your coming to me ? Mrs. Lucas . I really believe it was about two Minutes . Prisoner . Did I seem to be in any pain when I returned the second time . Mrs. Lucas . My Fright was so great , I ca n't tell . C. Did you ask her if she had made any provision for the Child ? Mrs. Lucas . She said she had wrote to her Mother for some things . Richard Lucas . My Wife called me to see if the Person who lodges in our House would resign her Room , that the Prisoner might have it , but she would not ; and at my Return , my Wife said to me , I hope Betty is not with Child . I then went into the Kitchen , and saw the Prisoner washing her Hands at the Water-tub , and the Bottom of her Apron was very bloody . I informed my Wife of this , and she said , she hoped there was nothing in the Vault , so I got a Candle and looked into it , and saw something which I took at first to be a piece of Cloth . I got Mrs. Watlin to come and see it , and I got a pair of Tongs , and turned it about , and then the Child 's Leg appeared . Upon this I went out to get Assistance , and locked the Door to prevent the Prisoner 's escaping , and before I returned the Child was taken out of the Vault , and was dead . C. Can you form any Judgment by the Growth of the Child ? Lucas . To my Thoughts , it seemed to be at its full Growth , for it had Hair and Nails . - I observed no Marks on it at all . Ann Davis . I was going by Mr. Lucas 's Door , and was desired to go in . I went into Mrs. Lucas 's Room , and she said the Prisoner was gone backwards , and staid a little longer than ordinary ; upon which I went to see what she was doing , and met her in the passage , opening the Door . I gave her Room to go by , and she went into the parlour and sat down , and seemed to be mighty bad . Mrs. Lucas said to her , `` I fear , Betty , thou hast `` been delivered of a Child . '' The Prisoner denied she had been delivered ; so Mrs. Lucas desired me to go backwards and see . Mr. Lucas gave me a Candle , and on looking down the Vault I perceived a new-born Infant . I informed Mrs. Lucas what I had seen , and endeavoured to get the Child up ; and , with the Assistance of another , I did get it up ; but it was dead . I believe it was at its full Growth , for there were Nails on its Hands , and Hair on its Head . The Child was not covered over with the Soil ; it lay on its Face , leaning rather to the left Side ; and the Face was in the Soil . C. Was there any thing about it ? Davis . Nothing at all ; it was quite naked , as it was born . Prisoner . Do you think it possible for a Child to be born casually from a Woman under these Circumstances ? Davis . I have heard of such things , but I never knew it . Ann Watlin . Mr. Lucas came to me , and asked me to lend him a Candle ; I did so , and he went up Stairs directly . He came down again presently , and desired me to go backwards with him , and look down the Vault : I did so , and he asked me , what I thought it was ; I said , I believed it was paper ; upon that he fetch 'd a pair of Tongs and rapped it ; it founded hard , and on his turning it about , a Leg or an Arm appeared . He strove to get it up , but could not , and he desired me to go into the Room to the Prisoner ; I did so , and asked her what she had done ? and told her , she had had a Child ; but she said , it was no such thing . I saw the Child afterwards , and there were no Marks of Violence at all upon it . Prisoner . Do you think it possible for Nature to do this ? Watlin . I am no competent Judge of that . God is sufficient at all times to help poor Creatures ; but I ca n't say I ever had any Trial of it . Prisoner . Had you any Conversation with me about making provision for the Child ? Watlin . No , I never heard her say any thing about that . Jane Ramsey . I went to see a Cousin of mine , who lodges at Lucas 's , and saw Mrs. Lucas , the Prisoner , and another Woman with a Child in her Arms , in the Room . The Woman said , she believed the Prisoner had been delivered ; and I saw the Child in a Pail , covered with an Apron . I asked the Prisoner if she had made any provision for it ; and she said she had sent into the Country for some things . DEFENCE . Prisoner . I asked for a Lodging , and they said they had none - I had the Colick , and the Child came from me - I did not know I was so near my Time . Henry Tailor . The Prisoner sent for me when she was at the Gate house , and said , there were several things in her Box : she sent the Key to the House keeper where she lived , and I was present at the opening the Box , and these things were found in it . A Witness . Here is every thing that is proper for a young Infant , and a great many poor Women have not so many . Mary Chambers . I carried the Key to Mr. Winnington 's House-keeper , and saw the Box opened , and these things taken out . The Prisoner delivered the Key to me , to fetch some things out of her Box , for her necessary Uses , and said , she had sent into the Country for some Child bed linen . Prisoner . Do you think it is not possible for a Child to be born in this manner , without the Mother 's being able to perceive it ? Chambers . I believe it is , but I never knew an Instance of it . Q. to Mrs. Lucas . Did the Prisoner say any thing to you , that there was any Child bed-linen in her Box ? Lucas . She said she had sent into the Country to her Mother ; - she sat in a very dull way , and said but little to any body . Prisoner . I had the things in my Box , but I was not sensible of telling it . Ann Lloyd . On the Thursday after the Prisoner was at the Gate-house , I asked her if she had made any preparation for the Child ; and she said , there were some things in her Box , which would be found when that was opened . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty , Death . 8. Edward Weedon , was indicted for stealing 8 pounds of Sugar , value 2 s. the Goods of Rowland Fry and Samuel Fry , May 11 . Thomas Miles . I am a Porter at Bear-key , and was going up Stairs into the common Warehouse , and met the Prisoner coming down : I asked him what he did there ; and he said , he had only been to take a little Sugar . I got hold of him , and found a Bag full under his Coat , and his pockets full besides . Prisoner . I was going by , and heard them cry , Who will work ? and when I came there , they wanted no body ; and I pick 'd up this Sugar off the Boards , lying loose . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9. Stephen Thompson , was indicted for stealing 2 pieces of Canvas , value 1 s. 6 d. and 2 pieces of Bays , value 5 s. 6 d. the Goods of John Upsdale and Elizabeth Kelloway , May 11 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 10. Ross Fox , of St. Dunstan in the West , Gent . was indicted , for that he , on the 21st Day of June , in the 11th Year of his present Majesty , feloniously did steal , in the house of Robert Blackwell , one Bond , commonly called an East-India Bond , No 12000 , bearing Date , November 1 , 1736 , sealed with the common Seal of the united Company of Merchants trading to the East-Indies ; by which Bond the said Company acknowledged to have received of William Webb the Sum of 50 l. which the said Company promised to repay to the said William Webb , his Executors , Administrators or Assigns , by Indorsement thereon , with Interest for the same , from the 31st of March then next , after the Rate of 3 per Cent . per Annum , on 6 Months Notice to be given by the said Company in the London Gazette , or 6 Months Notice to be given by the said Webb , to the said Company 's Accomptant ; for the true Payment whereof , the said Company and their Successors did bind themselves for the Payment of 100 l. & c. which said Bond was indorsed by the said William Webb , under his Hand , and the said Bond at the Commission of this Felony was of the Value of 50 l. and the property of John Woodward and others ; the said sum of 50 l. being then due and unsatisfy 'd , & c. against the Form of the Statute , & c. There not being sufficient Evidence to prove the property , the Prisoner was acquitted . 11 . * John Lupton of St. Andrew Holbourn , was indicted ( with Alexander Flack not taken ) for stealing a Silver handled Cup , value 3 l. and a Silver Spoon , val . 10 s. the Goods of William Zachary in his Dwelling-house ; Feb 26 . * The Prisoner was tried last Sessions on 2 Indictments for Burglaries . John Lowther . About 10 Weeks ago , the Prisoner and I and Alexander Flack went out with an Intent to go a-thieving . We went to Mr. Zachary 's House in Fisher 's Court , Red-Lion Street , between 8 and 9 at Night , and took out of the Beauset in his parlour , a Silver Cup and a Spoon . I was in my Shirt , and ran with them to Jervis Trueman 's at Fleet-Ditch , and asked him if he could purchase them ; he said he could not , but would help us to one that would , and we sold them to one Tom Cummins at Fleet-Ditch for 35 s. and gave Trueman eighteen pence for his Trouble . We all 3 looked into Mr. Zachary 's House , and they said the Chance was haddy and only 2 Children were in the Room , so they staid without to tip me Peter , and I went in and took the Goods . Prisoner . Did not Trueman come to you and desired you to swear against me ? Lowther . No , he never did . Prisoner . Why did not you come against me when I was here before ? Lowther . Because I was afraid of being taken . Jane Zachary . On the 26th of February between 7 and 8 o'Clock , I was out for 7 or 8 Minutes , and when I came Home , my Child told me , a Man had run away with the Cup . Guilty 39 s. He was a 2d Time indicted ( with Alexander Flack not taken ) for breaking and entering the Dwelling-House of Matth.ew Wheeler about 9 at Night , and stealing a Silver two handled Cup , val . 4 l. a Silver Mug , a silver Spoon , a silver Pepper-box , and a silver Punch-ladle , the Goods of the said Wheeler ; March 29 . Matthew Wheeler . On Easter Sunday last I went out of my House about 6 in the Evening , and returned at 8 . I went down into the Kitchen to Supper , and after Supper my Wife and Daughter went up Stairs into the Parlour to set some Tea Things away , and they had no sooner opened the Door but they both made an Outcry : I started out of my Chair , and my Daughter met me in the Entry and said I was robbed . I went into the parlour , and found the outside Window Shutters open , the Sash lifted quite up , and the Blind laid on a Bureau which stands near the Window . Upon this I searched the Beauset and missed a Winchester Quart two handled Cup , a Winchester pint Mug , a pepper-box , a large Spoon and a Punch Laddle , all which I am certain were safe at 4 o'Clock that Afternoon . When I came Home at 8 o'Clock that Evening the Window Shutters were pulled to , but not fastened and the Blinds were bolted , and when I went into the Room they were wide open , and a silver Spoon lay on the Floor . On the Sunday after this happened I advertis 'd what I had lost , with a Reward of four Guineas for any Person who should inform me of them , and on the Monday Morning about 11 o'Clock , a Woman brought me a Letter from Newgate , the Contents of which were , if I would come there , I should be put in a Way to get my Goods again : I took a Friend with me and went to Newgate and the Prisoner was brought to me as the Author of that Letter . When he saw me he fell into a sort of a whining Cry , and on his Knees desired I would admit him an Evidence , and he would declare the whole : whereof I took Pen , Ink and paper and took his Confession , but it did not answer to what I have found out since . He confessed that himself , Flack and Lowther , were concerned together ; that Flack went into the Room , Lowther stood at the Window , and himself stood Peter ; I suppose he meant that he stood to watch . He told me that he lighted the Candle at a Chandler 's Shop just by , and put it into the Dark Lanthorn himself . He likewise told me that the plate was sold to one Brown , but on my making Enquiry no such Person was to be found ; and he said he believed his Companions had sunk some of the Plate , for he heard it rattle in their Pockets , and on his asking them what it was , they told him , it was a Tobacco-box . Prisoner . I do n't know that ever I saw this Gentleman before . Daniel Owen . I went with the Prosecutor to Newgate , and the Prisoner said that he with Lowther and Flack broke into the Prosecutor 's House on Easter Sunday at Night , and took some Plate , but he only saw a 2 handled Cup , and something else , for they had sunk the rest on him . John Lowther . The Prisoner , and I and Flack went out between 8 and 9 at Night on Easter-Sunday . I went before and pulled open the Window Shutters of Mr. Wheeler 's House ; - it is in Denmark Court in the Strand : Flack pushed up the Sash , and then there was a Blind which was bolted , and we could not undo it for a long Time ; but at last Flack got it out , and put it on the Top of a Bureau . Then we shut the Window to , and sent the Prisoner to the next Door to light a Candle . When we had got a Light , Flack went in , but a Woman coming out of the Chandler 's with a Candle , we put the Shutters to again , and after that Flack took a silver 2 handled Cup , a silver pint Mug , a Spoon , a pepper-box and a Punch Ladle , and the Prisoner not minding the Woman who came out of the Chandler 's Shop , Flack flew into a Passion with him , and swore he should have none of the Money because he did not blow the Woman 's Candle out . We should have taken other Things out of the House , but we let a Spoon fall on the Floor , and thinking that alarm 'd the People , we all ran into the Strand and got a Coach , and directly went to Mrs. Bower 's , the Ship in Rag Fair . When we came to Bower 's we enquired for Betty Hope , but she not being on that side of the Town , we found out Jane Johnson , and she was not willing to buy any thing before the Prisoner or me , and so she and Flack went into another Room : Flack presently returned , and said he had made a Bargain for four Pounds ; but we told the Prisoner we had no more than a Guinea and an half , and so sunk all the rest . The Prisoner having nothing to offer in his Defence , nor any Witnesses to call , the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment ; Death . 12. Thomas Neck , was indicted for stealing a Riding Hood , a Holland Shirt , and a Linen Apron , the Goods of James Wooding , May 11 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 13. Thomas Ruby , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of John Tucker , between the Hours of 1 and 2 in the Night with Intent the Goods of the said Tucker to steal & c . April 28 . John Tucker . I keep the Angel Inn in St. Giles 's . On the 28th of April between 12 and 1 in the Morning my Servant informed me that the Watchman had found Thieves breaking into my Cellar , but they had made it secure again . I got up and search 'd about the House to see if any body was concealed , but found no body . My Man got up again between one and two , and cry 'd out Murder ! Thieves ! and ran about the House to alarm us , and presently afterwards hearing a second Noise , of some body in the Kitchen , I got up , and opened my Window , and called a-cross the Yard : immediately I saw a Man run along the Yard , and he limped with his right Leg , by which I was certain it was the Prisoner , who some Time before this had been my Servant . My Ostler hearing the Noise got up , and I desired him to lay hold of the Prisoner , but he not hearing what I said , the Prisoner made his Escape . After this I got a Candle , and in my Kitchen found the Prisoner 's Hat , Shoes , case Knife and penknife , and an Iron Fly belonging to a gaming Table , all which he owned to be his before the Justice . The Day after this I got a Warrant to take the Prisoner on Suspicion , and met him in Drury-Lane . I took hold of him and said , are you here Tom ? he made no Reply , but said , I hope Master you will forgive me . I told him as he had broke into my House , I could not forgive him , and he said he would ask ten thousand Pardons if I would excuse him . I kept him fast by the Hand and led him into a Public House , and gave him into the Custody of a Headborough . When we were at the Alehouse he owned that he broke into the House between one and two o'Clock , but said he came for Victuals . He confess 'd the same before the Justice , and begged very hard for his Hat , for he had none to wear . Samuel Digner . On the 28th of April , just as the Watchman was crying the Hour of twelve , he knocked at the Door , and told me some Thieves were breaking in at the Cellar Window : I got up , and li't a Candle , and the Watchman and I went into the Cellar to fasten the Windows , which were wrenched open wide enough for a Dog to get in . I am positive they were fast when I went to Bed , and when I got up and found them open , I could not shut them again , but 2 Watchmen coming by assisted me , and then I carried the Key up Stairs to my Master , and went to Bed again . In a little Time afterwards , hearing a sort of a rustling , I went into the Kitchen , and saw a Man which I verily believe was the Prisoner , stand up at the Cupboard . I cried Thie ves ! Murder ! and ran to lay hold of him , and immediately he ran out at the Window . I went up Stairs and alarmed the House , and this Iron Fly and the other Things were afterwards found in the Kitchen . Prisoner . Did he see me in the Kitchen ? Digner . I verily believe he was the Person that I saw go out of the Window . Thomas Claring . I happened to be out and met Mr. Tucker in St. Giles 's , and he desired me to go with him to see for the Prisoner . Accordingly I went to the Prisoner 's House , but he not being at Home , we went to an Alehouse over the way , and in a few Minutes the Prisoner was brought in . He confess 'd that he attempted to break Mr. Tucker 's Cellar Door , but being disturbed , he went into a Stone Cutter 's Yard , got over the Wall and broke in backwards at the Kitchen Window . After this I carried him into a back Room , and there he delivered some Implements for Gaming to his Wife , and when I carried him before Mr. De Viel , the Iron Fly and the other Things were produced and he owned them to be his , and that he left them in Tucker 's Kitchen . Prisoner . I was almost starved with Hunger , and went to Mr. Tucker 's with a view of getting some Victuals , thinking I could be bolder there than at another Place . Guilty Death . 14.

Upon that , the Prisoner said , D - n him , he has a good Watch , and pulled it out of my pocket . There was a Man to whom I owed some Money followed me from the Sale , and the Prisoner and the other Man , seeing him , they both ran away . This was on the 26th of April , between 5 and 6 in the Evening , and in about half an Hour afterwards they were taken . C. Did you ever find your Watch again ? Hedger .

Prisoner . Ask him whether , when he came home , his Daughter did not ask him where his Watch was , and whether he did not say , he had left it at the Red Lion ? Hedger . No , I did not .

Henry Corner . On Friday , the 24th Day of April , between 5 and 6 in the Evening , the Prisoner Piggot came to me , and asked me how I did , and desired me to drink part of a Tankard of Beer with him . I could not at that Time , but about 10 o'clock I met him in the play-house passage , and he again asked me to drink with him . The other Prisoner , Johnson , was there at the same Time , and we went to an Alehouse , and had two Tankards of Beer , for which I expected them to pay a part , but they said , if I would treat then , they would at another place ; and if I would go as far as St. Giles 's they would give me something that was good . This was in Drury Lane , and I not having my Hat en , did not chuse to go so far without ; so the Prisoner Piggot clapped his on my Head . When we got into the middle of Drury Lane , they knocked at a Door , but the people being a-bed , they led me about ; and the first place that we came to , that I knew , was the Duke of Bedford 's House in Bloomsbury Square . They then said , they would shew me my nearest Way home ; but instead of that , they carried me into the Fields , and the first Word they spoke to me was to borrow Money ; immediately one of them threw me down , stopped my Mouth , and got upon me ; Piggot pulled out my Watch by main Force , and tore my Buckle out of my Shoe , Strap and all ; and then both run away . Prisoner Piggot . Did he never leave his Watch in my Custody ? Corner . No , he never had any Watch of mine . C. Whereabouts did they rob you ? Corner . It was in the Field above Southampton-Row . When they robbed me , I cried Murder , and a Watchman coming up , I told him what had happened , and he said he would bring me a Constable the next Day : He did so , and they were both taken at a Milk-cellar in Gray's-Inn Lane . Thomas Perkins . I am a Watchman , and was just going to cry the Hour of 12 , when I heard Murder cried twice in the Field . I went up to the Field-Gate , and could see no body , but I afterwards met the Prosecutor very bloody . He told me , he had been robbed , and he knew one of the persons who were concerned ; and I told him I would bring him a Constable the next Morning . I did so , and we laid wait for the Prisoners in two Places . Corner and I waited for them at the Bear in Bow-street , Covent-Garden , where we staid 'till we had Information that the Constable had apprehended them at a Milk-cellar in Gray's-Inn Lane . Q . Did Corner direct you where to take them ? Perkins . He said , he knew one of them , and directed us to the place where it was most likely to find him . Edward Harvey . The last Witness came to me on the 25th of April , and told me , that a Man had been robbed of his Watch and Buckle , and he had told him where he lived , and that he knew one of the persons . We set out about 7 o'Clock in the Morning , and got Information , that a Milkwoman in Gray's-Inn Lane used to come to Piggot ; upon which I went to several Milk-cellars in the Lane , but none of them knew him ; and at last I came to the right , and on my enquiring for Piggot , the Woman said , he and another were just gone out together , but would be within in a short time . Upon this , I went to the Alehouse , and had Word sent me , from a Fellow-servant of Piggot 's at a Bagnio , that he was quickly expected at the Bear in Bow-street ; so I sent the Watchman and the Prosecutor into Bow-street ; and John Carter , the Headborough , and myself went again to the Milk-cellar ; and we had not been there long , before the two Prisoners came in . I catch 'd up a poker , and told them what my Business was , and then one of the Women lock 'd them up in her Room ; but after some Time , they surrendered , and we carried them before Justice Poulson , who examined them separate . They both confessed the Fact ; Johnson in particular said , he held Corner down , and stopped his Mouth , while Piggot took his Watch and Buckle , and then both ran away . Horton owned the same , and behaved with great Boldness at the Justice 's , and went out snapping his Fingers , singing , At the Tree I shall suffer with Pleasure ; and said , he should have a short Life and a merry one . C. Had you any Information where the Watch and Buckle were pawn 'd ? Harvey . Johnson told us where they were pawn 'd , and we found them accordingly . Corner . These are my Things , and are the same which I lost that Night . Piggot . I desire the Prosecutor may be asked whether we had any Arms about us ? Corner . No , they had not . Piggot . How could we put him in bodily Fear then ? Thomas Butler . This very Watch was brought to me by the Prisoner , Piggot . He said he brought it from a Gentleman , and my Master lent him two Guineas on it ; but I did not see any body with him . Harvey . Johnson directed me to this Pawnbroker , and said he was waiting at the Door while the other pawned it . Philip Rugier . The Prisoner , Piggot , brought this Buckle to me , and another Man was waiting at the outside of the Shop at the same Time . John Carter . The Prosecutor sent a Watchman to our House , about 7 in the Morning ; and soon afterwards Corner came , and said he had been robbed of his Watch and Buckle , by the Waiter at the Turk 's Head in Bow Street . He said , that Piggot took his Watch and Buckle , while Johnson held him down . After this , the Constable , a Watchman and I went to Gray's-Inn Lane ; we sat at an Alehouse some Time , and then Piggot went into the Milk-woman 's , and called Johnson in after him , and the Woman seeing us , she shut the Door , but the Constable jumped in at the Window ; and she said , if he went up Stairs , she would fetch a Warrant for him ; so he sent me for farther Assistance ; and before I returned , the Prisoners were taken . DEFENCE . Piggot . I met the Prosecutor between twelve and one that Day , and he asked me if I was turned Gentleman ? I told him I was hired to Mrs. Douglas ; he said he should be glad to drink with me , so I met him at 6 o'Clock that Evening as the Prince and Princess were going to the Play . He told me he had a great Fancy to see the Play , and would go into the Footman 's Gallery ; I having no Livery could not go with him , so I went into the upper Gallery with Johnson , and as we were coming out we met the Prosecutor again . He asked me to drink , and said he must step home and make his Appearance and would come to us ; so we went to the King 's Head in James Street and called for a Tankard of Beer . He came to us , and we sat 'till the Watchman came half an Hour past Eleven , and then he paid for the Beer ; and we not chusing to drink any more Beer , he said , if we would go with him towards Tottenham Court , he would give us something that was good . Upon this we went with him , and when we came into the Fields , we crossed over towards St. Giles 's . I staid behind a little to make Water , and presently I heard Johnson cry our Hort ! Hort ! upon which I went up to him and found the Prosecutor in a very indecent Posture . Upon my coming up , he desired we would not expose him , and he would give us all he had ; and having no Money about him he gave us his Watch and both his Buckles ; but recollecting himself , he said , `` when I go home having lost both my Buckles , `` the people at our House will think I have pawned `` them , and therefore we gave him one of his Buckles again . - Farrel .

On the 12 of February about 9 at Night , William Alley called me out of my Shop and gave me a Warrant to take one Thomas Robinson . I went into Drum-Alley in Drury-Lane , and at the White Horse there , I found him . I told him I had a Warrant against him , and he said he would not go , and in a little Time , a great many People came with Clubs , Sticks and Hangers , and swore they would bail him . Immediately they took him from me , and beat me : I got out of the House into the Alley , and Hunt , Cassody , and Timms who are executed , the Prisoner , and several others who are fled to Ireland , knocked me down . Which of them it was that did knock me down , I ca n't tell , but they were all present , and when I was down , the Prisoner stamped on me , and some of them turned my Left-hand Breeches-Pocket the wrong Side outwards , and took out a Knife , a Key , 3 s. 6 d. in Silver , and about 5 or 6 pennyworth of Half-pence . After this , I followed them into Holsford 's Alley , to one South 's , and saw Hunt and Timms there ; and when I came from thence , I saw the Prisoner at the End of the Alley , and he ran towards Clare-market , and got away . From that Time I never saw him again , 'till I took him , on the 24th of April , in Cary street . Q Are you sure the Prisoner was among the persons that used you in this Manner ? Rhodes .

I lodged in Mr. South 's House , in Holsford 's Alley ; there was a Club of Irishmen , which used to meet there and spend 3 d. a piece every Thursday Night . One Evening a Man came from the White Horse in Drum-Alley , to inform the Club , that Robinson was taken : Immediately they went down Stairs into the Yard , and broke the Mopsticks and Broomsticks , and went out with Intent to rescue Robinson . There were Timms , Cassody , Hunt , and the Prisoner , and several others ; and they all went out together . They had not been gone long , before they brought Robinson with them .

After we had taken him , one Charles Maccleaver went out of the Window , into Holsford 's Alley , and a whole Posse of Irishmen came with Broomsticks and other Weapons , and rescued Robinson . Upon this , Rhodes was glad to get out of the House , and when he got about 6 Yards into the Alley , Hunt knocked him down , Timms stood over him with a Stick , and the Prisoner was the Man who stamped upon him , and said , D - n him , kill him ; but what Money he lost I ca n't tell . Q . Are you sure the Prisoner was one of them ? Atley . Yes , I am sure he was , for I knew him before , and have drank with him .

I am a Milkman , and as I was going about my Business , picked up this piece of the Woman 's pocket . Prisoner . What Time in the Morning did he find it ? Wright . I believe it was about half a quarter of an Hour past Seven . Elizabeth Porter . I came from Bristol about 2 Months ago , and wanting private Lodgings , I took a Room in Cornor 's House . One Night , about 9 or 10 o'Clock - I ca n't tell what sort of Time it was , but I believe it was about 6 Weeks ago , I saw Mrs. Connor 's Husband give her a Guinea and some Silver , and she went out . She returned as dirty as if she had been rolled in the Kennel , and said , she had been robb 'd ; that three Men were concerned , and that she knew the person who knocked her down . Prisoner . What did you say to Mrs. Connor when she went out ? Porter . Her Husband asked her , why she had not got Butter and Sugar ; and then she fetch 'd him some white , and some brown Sugar ; I believe there were about 3 pounds and an half of each . Prisoner . Did you see any Gold in Mrs. Connor 's Hand , when she went out ? Porter . Yes , her Husband handed the Guinea over the Counter to me , and I gave it to her . DEFENCE . Prisoner . This Woman 's Husband is a Smugler . On the 7th of April , I took up one Kennedy , a Smugler , who lodges in their House , for calling me Informer , because I had made a Discovery of a great deal of Tea , and they were lying in wait to shoot me ; and because I made this Discovery , they have sworn fastly against me . Patrick Kelly . I met the Prisoner in the Street , and he asked me , if I knew one Kennedy , a Smugler , and desired me to go to Connor 's , to ask him to bail him : accordingly I told Connor the Story ; but he would not bail Kennedy . Prisoner . Did not Connor threaten what he would do to me , if I informed against any of his Lodgers ? Kelly . I know nothing at all of that . I remember nothing else said by Connor in relation to the Prisoner . Katharine Kelly . I am Wife to the last Witness , and what I have to say , I will say very true . I came to the Prisoner 's House , the Night before he was taken , between 7 and 8 o'Clock , which was the very Night that Connor says she was robbed : The Prisoner was sitting by the Fire , with some Oatmeal to make a little Broth for himself and his Wife . I was for going Home , but he desired me to get his Supper ready ; so I staid 'till near one o'Clock in the Morning ; and I declare on my Oath , he never left the House , from the Time that I went in , to the Time of my coming away . His Wife is my Sister , and she and her Children were lying on the Bed at the same Time . John Longhton . I know nothing of the Prisoner ; I never saw him before to-day in my Life . As to Atterbury , he is a very extravagant Fellow , and has spent a great deal of Money . Q . Do you think he would perjure himself ? Loughton . I ca n't charge him with that - I ca n't judge of people 's Consciences . - I did say , that if he had a great deal of Money , he would be very troublesome . Prisoner . Atterbury said at the Gate to Day , that if he should hang me , he should have a great deal of Money , and would drive all Kensington Gravel-pits before him . Sarah Graham . Last Wednesday was 5 Weeks I was at the Prisoner 's House ; his Wife was sick a Bed , and 2 Children along with her . The Prisoner was sitting by the Fire-side , and there was a pot boiling on the Fire , with a Breast of Mutton in it . I went there just as St. Giles 's Bell rung Nine , and as I came out of the House , the Watchman went Eleven ; and the Prisoner was not out of the House all the Time . Mrs. Kelly was there , and I left her and another Woman , whose Name is Gough , behind me when I went away . Q . How came you to recollect the Time ? Graham . I lodged in his House 3 Quarters of a Year ; I left it on the Saturday , and went to fetch some Things away from thence . Jane Gough . On Wednesday Night I went to see the Prisoner 's Wife and Children , and he lay on the Foot of the Bed ; to the best of my Knowledge , it was in April . I went there about 10 o'Clock , and found his Wife and 3 Children sick ; and his Brother and Sister were there at the same Time . I staid with them the best part of an Hour ; and the Prisoner had a Breast of Mutton boiling on the Fire ; and he never stirr 'd out of the House while I was there . Richard Humphries . I was Constable , and apprehended the Prisoner . Prisoner . Ask him if he did not desire me to make myself an Evidence ? Humphries . I told him t hen was his Time to save himself , and he said he knew nothing at all of the Matter . Prisoner . Did he trust me in the Care of Atterbury alone that Day ? Humphries . I had him to my own House ; and it was in the Fore-room , and we were in and out all Day . Q . Was Atterbury there ? Humphries . Yes , he was there all Day . Q . Did you charge Atterbury to assist you ? Humphries . No , I did not , the Man that I charged to assist me is not here . Q . Were the Prisoner and Atterbury together alone any part of the Day ? Humphries . They might be alone for some small Space of Time . Prisoner . Did he hear me say to Atterbury , there were 2 Men concerned with me ? Humphries . No I did not , nor any Thing like it . Q . During the Time that the Prisoner was in your Custody , what did he say for himself ? Humphries . He always insisted that he knew nothing of what he was charged with . Jury . Who was the 1st Man that laid hold of the Prisoner ? Humphries . It was one Horsenail , a Plumber in Cow Lane . Q. to Atterbury . How came you to go to this Constable 's House with the Prisoner ? Atterbury . Humphries shew 'd me the Warrant at the Cobler 's Door , so I and another Man catched hold of the Prisoner . Prisoner . Where did I tell him that 2 Men were concerned with me ? Atterbury . It was in the Fore Box , and he would have told me every Thing had not the Woman come in , and given him Money . James Ingram . I have seen the Prisoner at an Alehouse which I used , and never knew any Harm of him . I was present when Mrs. Connor brought the Warrant to the Constable 's House , and then we went to the Cobler 's , were the Prisoner was taken . Prisoner . I desire this Witness may be asked , how long he sat with me at Humphries 's House , and whether I was not asked divers Times to make myself an Evidence . Ingram . There were 2 or 3 People that asked him to be an Evidence , and he said , would you have me be an Evidence of what I know nothing at all of ? I was in the House with him from the Time he was taken , to the Time that he went before Mr. De Veil , and he always continued in the same Story , and never made any Confession at all . Prisoner . Did he hear me own that there were two other Persons concerned with me in this Robbery ? Ingram . No , I never did . Joshua Bewley . I am an Officer of the Excise . Connor is a Smugler , and the Prisoner has been very serviceable to the Revenue . I have seized Tea my self several Times on his Information . Thomas Daniel . I am an Officer of the Excise . I have made several Seizures on the Prisoner 's Informations , and in particular , the last Time I was out with him , the Prosecutrix and some others threatned him , and said they would serve him such a Trick as should make him smart before it was long , for at that Time he had given me an Information against these People . Martin Colton . I likewise am an Officer of the Excise , and have had several Informations from the Prisoner . Francis Waker . I am a Stove Grate Maker , and the Prisoner has been a Servant to me off and on for 8 or 9 Years , and always behaved well .

Henry Downes . I have known the Prisoner these 5 or 6 Years : I always took him to be a hard working Man , and never heard him charged with Theft . Lewis Sellier . He worked for me last Winter , and I always took him to be an honest Man . Patrick Murphey . The Prisoner worked on the same Floor with me , and always labour 'd very hard . Mary Melon .

You say , that the Bonds were for 100 l. apiece , and that she owned she had them ; did she own that she received the Money ? Alexander .

Did she tell you to whom these Bonds were sold ? Alexander . She said , that Mr. Bradshaw in Leadenhall-street had sold them for her , and brought her the Money ; but before the Bonds were sold , she went to the East-India House to receive the interest . Coun . Who was present when she owned this ? Alexander . There were Mr. Greenaway , Mr. Maydon , and the Constable ; and she said , she had received the Money in the Names of Amy Gray , and Ann Eadey . Prisoner . Ask her where these Things were laid in Way 's House ? Alexander . They lay on a Shelf in a little place , which we call the Coal-hole . John Maydon . I took out Letters of Administration , upon Mr. Way 's Death . The Letters of Administration were read . Mr. Maydon . I entered into the House , and was in possession of it ; but knew of no Bonds , 'till a Girl gave me Information of them . Coun . What were these Bonds ? Maydon . They were East-India Bonds , No . 11734 , 11736 , and 11737 , for 100 l. apiece . Coun . Did you know what became of them ? Maydon . We heard that they were sold to one Bradshaw . The Prisoner was taken on Suspicion of stealing them , and denied that she saw any Bonds for a great while , 'till Bradshaw was sent for , and then she was sensible that she had sold them . Coun . When Bradshaw came , what did she say ? Maydon . She said , she had sold 3 Bonds of 100 l. apiece , and had received 300 l. for them , and that she had got some of the Money in a Box in Southwark . We went there , and found the Box in a Brandy shop ; she gave us leave to break it open , and we found 250 l. which she owned was part of the Money ; and she said , she would make Satisfaction for what was spent : she likewise owned , that she had received the Interest at the East-India House , but I did not hear her say , in what Name she received it . C. You say , you did not know when Way died , that these Bonds were in the House . Maydon . No , I did not know any thing of them 'till a Girl brought me Information , that they were stolen out of the House . Henry Sedgewick . I am a Broker , and was employed by Mrs. Way to buy these Bonds , on the 23d of September , 1740 . Coun . What Bonds were they ? Sedgewick . They were India Bonds for a hundred Pounds a piece , the Numbers were 11734 , 11736 , and 11737 , and the Penalty of each Bond was 200 l. Coun . To whom did you deliver these Bonds ? Sedgewick . To Mrs. Way , and she paid 300 l. 16 s. and 4 d. for them . Prisoner . I desire Mrs. Alexander may be asked how these Bonds came into her Custody ? Alexander . Mrs. Way who was my Aunt , was troubled with Fits , and lost 2 Gold Rings , so she desired me to look into a Chest for them , and I found these Bonds there in a Tin-cannister ; I expected her to die , and so I took them from thence . - Bradshaw . I am a Trunk maker by Trade , but my Father keeps a Public House in Leadenhall Street and I live with him . On the 3d or 4th of last April the Prisoner came to one Mrs. Russel who lives at the Back of our House , and told her she had 3 Bonds to dispose of . Mrs. Russel brought them to my Father , and I fetched one Mr. Lyon a Broker to our House ; - The Prisoner was there at the same Time . Mr. Lyon said the Bonds were very good , and if she came honestly by them , he would purchase them : he said the Interest was due the 6th of April , and if she would go and receive that , he should be satisfied that they were honest . She received the Interest , and then desired me to go with them to Lyon 's , and bring her 300 l. for them , and I went with him to a Banker 's and he paid me for them directly . Coun . What Day did you sell these Bonds to Lyon ? Bradshaw . It was on the 6th of April . Mr. Sedgewick . The Premium at that Time was upwards of 4 l. so that there was 12 l. lost by them . Bradshaw . The Numbers were 11734 , 36 , and 37 , and she desired me to get her 300 l. for them . She had a Man with her whom she called Husband , and I said it was a Wonder she troubled herself with these Bonds , and she said she could not trust her Husband with them . Coun . What sort of Money did Lyon pay you the 300 l. in ? Bradshaw . It was in three Pound twelves , and Thirty six Shilling pieces . Coun . to Mrs. Alexander . You say you saw the Money taken out of the Prisoner 's Box , what pieces were they ? Alexander . They were 3 l. 12 s. and 36 s. pieces . John Roberts . I apprehended the Prisoner . Coun . Give an Account of what she said at that Time . Roberts . I was sent for about 5 o'Clock in the Evening to the George Inn , in Aldersgate Street , and took Charge of the Prisoner . She would not own any Thing 'till Bradshaw came , and then she began to squeek , and said to Mrs. Alexander , `` Patty , I `` always had a Value for you , and I can give you `` above 200 l. of the Money back again . '' She said the Money was at a Relation 's of hers , who was a Distiller in the Maze , Southwark . Then her Box was fetched from thence and brought to the White Lyon in Aldersgate Street , and the Prisoner broke it open herself with a Poker . There was about 250 l. in the Box , and the Attorney asked her if it was the Property of Mrs. Alexander , and she said it was . Coun . Did she say it was the produce of these Bonds ? Roberts . Yes , and that it was all that was left , but she would make Satisfaction for what she had spent when it lay in her Power . Prisoner . Did I break the Box open , or Mrs. Alexander ? Roberts . She sat near the Fire , and rose up , and broke it open herself . Prisoner . Ask Mrs Alexander who broke the Box open ? Mrs. Alexander . At first she said the Box should not be broke open , but afterwards she took the poker out of the Fire , and I broke it open myself with her Leave . Roberts . The Prisoner broke it about half open ? Mr. Webb . I belong to the East India House . Coun . You know the Numbers of those Bonds , who appears to have received the Interest on them ? Mr. Webb . As near as we can tell by the writing , ( for it is very bad ) the Interest was received in the Name of Ann Eadey on the 6th of April . Prisoner . A Boy picked up these Notes in the Coal-hole and gave them to me . Elizabeth Stokes . I was at the Death of Alexander 's Uncle , Mr. Way , and I was attentive ( attended ) in the Way of my Business on Mrs. Way : she was not capable of looking after her own Business , but was taken to drinking , and I have known he to go to the Bottle 14 or 15 Times in an Hour When Mr. Way was dead , the Brewer came and got Mrs. Way when she was not in her Senses to go , and he administered to her Husband 's Will , whereof after they had led the old Woman up in Ignorance for 3 or 4 Days , they brought an Execution into the House ; and there was a Country Boy that was a Servant there one Day called me , and said he was afraid his Mistress was dead , whereof I got up , and the Woman was as good as dead indeed , but we smoked a Pipe of Tobacco under her Nose and brought her to herself : whereof she had another Fit , and then the Kinswoman , as I may call her , went to Mrs. Way 's pocket Apron and took out the Key of the Chest : then she opened the Chest , and took out 14 or 15 l. 2 silver Spoons , and a Ladle ; then she took a Tin Box , and took out of it something which I could perceive was a Bond . She then went to another great Chest , and took a Box of Silver Pence , and went away . She came in again soon afterwards , and took some other Things away , and two more papers out of the Tin Box ; whereof she came to me afterwards , and said , that Mrs. Reason had stole the Things which I saw her take out of the Tin Box , and she would hang her , if there was not another Woman in the World . Coun . Are you sure there was an Execution in the House ? Stokes . Yes , Mr. Maydon brought it in , while I was in the House . Coun . What do you call an Execution ? Stokes . Indeed I ca n't say , - but I know , when the Execution was brought in , Mrs. Alexander fill 'd her pockets with Money . Mr. Way is dead , and after her Husband 's Death , there was a false Will made , and I was a Witness to it . C. to Alexander . When did your Aunt die ? Alexander . I ca n't justly tell the Day of the Month , but she was buried on St. Mark 's Day , and died the Wednesday before . Mr. Way died the 23d of March . Daniel Hatton . I lived at Mr. Way 's . My Master died on Friday and the Sunday following , I was sent down into the Cellar , for a Shovel of Coals , and found some papers in the Coal-hole , and gave them to the Prisoner . Coun . How came you to give them to the Prisoner ? Hatton . I do n't know what they were , for I can neither write nor read : - I thought they might serve to light pipes of Tobacco . I know nothing , but that I pick 'd them up . Jury . What sort of papers were they ? Hatton . They were 3 single papers , like Letters . Jury . Were they written on both Sides ? Hatton . I ca n't tell . Jury . Was there any Seal upon them ? Hatton . I believe there was , but I ca n't be positive . C. to Alexander . Did the Prisoner live with your Aunt ? Alexander . She lodged there 2 Years , and was a Servant at the Death of the Man , but not at the Death of the Woman . She paid 2 s. a Week for her Lodging , and used to work for 2 s. 3 d. a Week , because there was a Score between them . C. When did you put these Bonds into the Coal-hole ? Alexander . On the Saturday Morning . C. How long was this after your Uncle died ? Alexander . It was the Saturday after he died ; and I missed them the Sunday following . I asked Hatton about these papers , and he said he had not seen any ; and the Prisoner said the same . Q. to Maydon . Did Hatton ever tell you , that he took these papers out of the Coal-hole ? Maydon . No , he never pretended any such Thing . The Prisoner denied she had seen them , 'till Bradshaw came ; and then she said the Boy gave them to her . Hatton . As soon as I picked them up , I gave them to the Prisoner ; she was then standing at the Coal-house Door . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner of the stealing out of the House , and found her guilty of the Felony only . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 28.

And 29. Margery ( the Wife of Richard ) Bunce , for receiving the same , knowing them to be stolen . John Lowther . On the 3d or 4th of last March , between 8 and 9 at Night , the Prisoner , and I , and Alexander Flack , went into Wine-Office-Court , in Fleet-Street . We saw a Maid washing a House there , and she went down Stairs for a pail of Water , and left the Door open . Flack , seeing the Door open , said , there was a Chance , and thought there had been no body in the Room : They bid me go in ; so I went through the parlour into the Kitchen , where there were 2 Children at play by the Fire-side . There was no Candle in the Room , and I happened to put my Hand up just at the Corner of the Room , and felt a Bundle of Linen , which I took away ; and the Maid coming up with the Water , we all ran away , as fast as we could to the Prisoner Bunce 's , in Green 's Rents by Fleet-Ditch . As I was coming through Bride's-Alley , I dropped some of the Linen , and met Bunce ; she said , I was in a great Hurry , not to stay to pick it up , and so she took it up herself , and followed me to her House . When we came there , we went up into her one pair of Stairs Room , and looked over the Things ; there were laced Caps , laced Handkerchiefs , Shirts , Caps and Aprons , and she said , they were all Rags , and worth but a Trifle ; so she gave us 7 s. 6 d. for them , and we shared it amongst us . Charles Jephson . About the 3d of March , I was out , and when I came Home , my Wife informed me , we had been robb 'd of some Linen , while the Maid was gone for a Pail of Water . Upon this , I printed some Bills , but heard nothing 'till I saw Lowther 's Information , in which was this Robbery . I went to him in Bridewe , and he gave me exactly the same Account of it as he has now . C. to Lowther . What Things were there in the Bundle ? Lowther . There were a great many Caps , but I did not understand the Names of the Things ; for Bunce snatched them out of my Hand , and said , they were all Rags . Martha Kempster . I know that the Prisoner Bunce bought this Linen of Lupton , Lowther , and Flack , at her House in Green 's Rents . When Lowther brought the Bundle up Stairs , it was opened , and there were two ruffled Shirts in it , a laced Pinner and Coif , and a laced Handkerchief about two Fingers bread . There were a great many other Things , and she gave them 7 s. 6 d. for them all ; but I believe they were worth at least between 4 and 5 l. She told me , she had bought a great many Things of them , but this was the best Bargain that she ever had . Jury . Did you see the Money paid ? Kempster . Yes , she pulled out a green Purse , and gave them five Shillings , and the rest in Six-pences . Elizabeth Jephson . I happened to go out to my Mother 's , and when I came home , those Things were gone : I took them off the Lines myself before I went out , and tied the small Things up in a Handkerchief , and put them into the other Bundle . Kempster . They were in two Bundles when they were brought in . The Pinner and Coif , the Handkerchiefs and other small Things were in one Bundle , and the rest in another . Elizabeth Colombine . I am Mr. Jephson 's Servant . I was washing the House that Day , and went down Stairs for Water , and when I came up again , I missed the Linen off the Dresser in the Kitchen .

I am Servant to Mrs. Barnes , and this Money was left in my Care . About 3 Months before this Money was missed , my Mistress told it over herself and locked it up , and then there were 25 Guineas , which she desired me to take particular Care of . On the 15th of last Month , I got up in the Morning to go to be blooded , and left my Mistress a-bed ; the Prisoner , who was an Apprentice in the House where my Mistress lives , let me out , and went over Tower-Hill with me , and said he would meet me as I came back , but he did not . When I came back , my Mistress 's Curtains were pinn 'd together , which gave me a Suspicion that some body had been in the Room , so after Dinner we looked over the Money and missed 4 Guineas . I ca n't swear who took the Money , but afterwards 4 Guineas were found in the Prisoner 's Box , and we thought no one could take it but him . Thomas Keynton . I am a Barber and the Prisoner is my Apprentice . Mrs. Barnes missing some Money , and I hearing that the Prisoner had a private Key to my Door , I got a Constable , and took him up Stairs and asked him about the Key ; at first he denied that he had any , and then I asked him about the Money , but he would not own that he knew any Thing of it , so I ordered my other Man to bring up the Prisoner 's Box into the Room , and when he found that I would search it , he called me aside , and owned that he had taken 3 Guineas , and no more . Prisoner . Had I not more Money in my Box when it was opened ? Keynton . Yes , there were 4 Guineas in Gold , and 7 s. in Silver . Prisoner . I do n't know but I might say , that I took Mrs Barnes 's Money ; but I was so frighted , that I did not know what I did . John Hodges . I was the Constable . I can only say , that Keynton asked the Prisoner about this Affair , and told him if he knew any thing of it , and would own it , it might be better for him , and then he owned , that he had taken 3 Guineas . Richard Brooker . The Prisoner came frequently to our House for Wigs , and I never observed any thing amiss in him . James Walton . I have known the Prisoner from his Infancy , and never heard but that he was a very sober Lad . He sued out his Indentures some Time ago , but was prevailed on to go to his Master again ; and since that Time , I believe , he has been too rigid with him . Robert Pancridge . I have known the Prisoner 's Friends for these 20 Years past , and never heard any thing against them . John Haines .
