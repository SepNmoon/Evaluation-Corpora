John Turner depos 'd to this Effect , I was Prisoner in the Fleet , October 1727 , Mrs. Barkley lodg 'd within 3 Rooms of me , I am an Upholder by Trade , and was call 'd into Mrs. Barkly 's Room by Mr. Pindar , to appraise her Goods , I took an Inventory of what appear 'd , the Boxes were mentioned in gross , and not opened ; there was a Person they call 'd Constable , after they said the Door was broke open , I went in again , and Mr. Bambridge sent to Mrs. Barkley for her Keys , she refus 'd to send them , whereupon Mr. Bambridge broke open the Boxes , and wrote the Title of an Inventory on loose Paper , and order 'd I should Copy it on the Head of my Inventory , which was to this Effect , An Inventory of the Goods of Elizabeth Berkley , for 56 l. Rent , due to Mr. Huggins , October 23d , 1 Bedstead with Sacking Bottom , & c. I gave Mr. Bambridge a particular Account of the Value , in order for his disposing of them , the 2d Inventory consisted of the Plate , China , Rings , & c. with precious Stones and wearing Apparel , which was all made up , Mr. Bambridge being told by me , that it was not usual to Distrain necessary wearing Apparel , he said , set down such and such things sufficient to do so : I brought them in at first 30 l. Mr. Bambridge thought that too much , alledging there was Charges attending the Appraisement , and so I brought it in at 27 l. 16 s. 9 d. It is customary to have two Appraisors , but there was none but my self - after the Appraisement , I saw Mr. Bambridge put some of the things in his Pocket , as the Silver Tea Spoons , Rings , and small things , the rest , wearing Apparel , & c. into a Portmantua ; there was a Brush found which is used for cleaning of Diamonds , upon which Mr. Bambridge said he believ 'd there must be Diamonds , after that , looking every where , found the Rings , Mrs. Barkley look 'd very Chagrin during this Rifling , and was turn 'd on the Common-Side , without a Bed to lie on , and had not a Bed all the time of my Imprisonment , she was afterwards very much out of Order , talked wildly , would assert that the Lord Harcourt was not Dead , but would punish such Rogues as robb 'd her . Mr. Bambridge , desir 'd this Evidence to tell the Court if he did not order him to put every thing down , who answer 'd , he did , but added , that if he had had Money , he would have given 30 l. for the Goods himself , because he knew them to be worth so much , that he lower 'd the price to 27 l. at Bambridges 's desire ; being ask 'd what Conversation he heard at that time , he answer 'd , Mr. Bambridge told Mrs. Berkley , that it was a Shame she should have there and not pay her Rent , for she had good comings In , Mrs. Berkley said , the House was the King 's , and if the King sent her there she would pay no Rent ; Turner said , that he had made several Distresses before , with Pindar , the Chamberlain , who Mr. Bambridge said was indicted that he might not be an Evidence for him , but was told that he was a Principal concern 'd . This Evidence being ask 'd what Trade Pindar was of , he answer 'd a Distiller , and that there was one they call 'd Constable at both Seizures , but Pindar knew nothing of the Value of Household Goods . Then Mr. Bambridge desir 'd this Evidence might be ask 'd if he did not propose to Barkley to send to some Friend to pay her Rent , and save her Goods , who answer 'd , he did . Thomas Wilkinson depos 'd to this Effect , ( N. B . But before Thomas Wilkinson could enter upon his Evidence , Mr. Bambridge desir 'd he might be ask 'd what Money he receiv 'd , and how long he had been maintain 'd to be an Evidence against him , but was told by the Court that such a Question was not proper to be ask 'd , if he could prove it , he might . ) I was a Prisoner in the Fleet on the Common Side , and saw the prisoner at the Bar at Mrs. Barkelys Door , about 6 o'Clock at Night , the latter end of October , I believe it might be the 27th . ( there was 2 Padlocks on the Door , Pindar had the Key of one , and Mrs. Barkely the Key of the other ; Barns , by order , fetched a Hammer to break it off ; Bambridge gave orders to Pindar to unlock the Door . There was Turner , Barns , Bambridge , my self , Pindar , and a Constable , as they called him , ( he had a short Staff ) but I never saw him before , nor since . Mrs. Barkley was fetched up from the Common Side to open the Door , but she refusing it , they broke her Door open with a Poker , ( Mrs. Barkley said it was a Robbery , and hoped Bambridge would be brought to Justice for it ) when they got in , they took an Account of a few Goods when required Mrs. Barkley to open her Boxes ( 2 of which were locked , the other nailed ) Bambridge broke them open himself , and some of the Goods were taken out by Mr. Turner , as Appraiser , and the other part by Bambridge : When the Goods were Appraised , they were all carried away by order of Mr. Bambridge ; I carried the Bed into the Lumber Room , and afterwards carried it to Dorset-Stairs , to go to Wandsworth - the Rings , Bambridge put into his Pocket , for fear they should be lost in the Boxes , the wearing Apparel , & c. Was put up into a Portmantua , Mrs. Barkely was by , and Scolded all the while , and said it was a Robbery , ( being asked what he see Bambridge put in his Pocket ) said , 2 Gold Seals , an Emrald , some Stones , a Garnet , 2 Gold Rings , one a Stone Ring , but never saw any of them afterwards ; Bambridge found a little Brush , and said , he believed there must be Diamonds , at first he said the Goods were going to a Sale , and bid me go to the Wandsworth Waterman , the Easy-chair was left with Mr. Turner to clean , and then I carried it to Wills Coffee-House : ( Mr. Bambridge desired that this Evidence might be asked , if there was no talk about Rent ) he said there was ; ( desired be might be asked when the Goods were carried out ) answered , about 6 Days after they had been in the Lumber Room , but they were locked up , and Bambridge kept the Key , asked if he did not send the Goods out of the Prison publickly , said , he did , asked if Mrs. Barkley was not the Room all the while , answer 'd , I am not positive , for after Mrs. Barkley 's Bed was carried out , you sent me to fetch a nasty Bed that Mrs. Barkley would not lye upon , there were better in the Room , which you sent away afterwards . Ambrose Burgiss depos 'd to this effect , I was in the Fleet , but not by , when the Door was broke open , but afterwards ( in October ) I went into the Room , and there were Mr. Bambridge , Barns , Pindar , Mr. Dowglass , and Mr. Turner ; I see the Boxes broke , and there were abundance of good Things , as Cloaths , China , Orrice Lace , Pearl , Emrald or Ruby , which Mr. Bambridge put into his Pocket ( as he said ) for fear they should be lost : Mr. Turner weighed the Gold Lace 20 Ounces and a half ; during the time the 3 Boxes were opened I was there , and Mrs. Barkley was there too . Mr. John Savage depos 'd to this Effect , I was going by the end of the Gallery when the last Inventory was taken , and observing a Number of People at Mrs. Barkley 's Door , went out of Curiosity to see what was the Matter , and I found Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Dowglass were got into her Room and Mr. Bambridge demanded Mrs. Barkley 's Keys , she reply 'd , she would give him none , he had no Authority to have them , Mr. Bambridge said he had , and that she should see presently , then broke open the Boxes where was very good wearing Apparel fit for a Gentlewoman , and other rich Goods ; in a draw , there was a Box wherein was 4 Rings , I think one had some small Diamonds round it , the middle out , 2 Seals set in Gold I believe one to be an Amathis , a Siver handled Knife and Fork in a Shagreen Case , which I think Bambridge put into his Pocket , an did not pull them out again there ; the other valuable Goods were collected into a Portmantua - I was present when the Inventory of all the Cloaths were taken , and Mr. Turner telling Mr. Bambridge , that it was not usual to distrain necessary wearing Apparel , he ordered him to put down the Quantities they contained as if not made up . Mr. Bambridge asked , if the Rings , & c. were not shown in the Coffee-Room afterwards , Mr. Savage said , they were ? but added that it was in a private Room , and none but his own Company there . Mr. Mendez Soles depos 'd to this Effect , Capt . Dowglass brought a Ring to know the Value , desired I would pull the Stone out and weigh the Gold , I told him it was an Amathis he said it came from Mr. Bambridge ; after that Mr. Bambridge came himself ; and asked me if it was an Amathis , I told him I was sure it was , then Mr. Bambridge ordered it to be cut , and afterwards told me he had it from Mrs. Barkely , and I set it for him , I set 2 Rings for Mr. Bambridge , one the value of about 30 s. Dr. Coletheart brought a Garnet with a Brillant from Mr. Bambridge , sometime after Dr. Coletheart and the Person that keeps Wills Coffee-house , brought a Ring to know the Value of it , worth about 14 l. a Diamond in the middle . Mr. Bambridge asked if he knew the Ring , Mr. Mendez Soles , said he believed he did , Mr. Bambridge show 'd him a Ring and asked him if that was it ? Mr. Mendez upon looking upon it , said , he believ 'd it might .

For the better supplying London with the above Waters , I keep three Teams of Horses , purposely to bring them fresh every Week ; and tho ' I am at so grate an Expence , I doubt for to sufficient Encouragement , and that the Publick will distinguish between Waters brought up by Sea ( which sometimes are Months before they arrive , and many Months before all are sold ) and Waters brought up by Land Carriage , especially as the Prices are the same . Every Person may send to my Shop , At the Golden-Tea-Canister , in Fleet-Street , near Temple-Bar ; Where my Waggon stands , every Wednesday , from 6 , and receive the Waters fresh out of it . I not only sell them at the same Prices as such as bring them up by See , but will also make a proper Allowance on Hath and Bristal Waters to such as sell them again . What has gained the Holt Waters such a great Reputation , is chiefly the wonderful Success they have had in all Scrophulous and Scorbutick Cases , in the King 's Evil , Running Sores , Inward Ulcers , Incident and even Bleeding Cancers , Inward and Outward Piles . They have one extraordinary Virtue , which I have hither-to designedly for bore mentioning . viz . in strengthening and heating Weaknesses in the Seminal Vessels ; but I am desir 'd to mention it by several Persons who have been cured by them or old Gleets of long standing . I fell the following Commodities at the most reasonable Rates , viz . Hott Waters 10 s. Bath Waters 7 s. 6 d. Bristol Waters 6 s. Spaw Waters 14 s. Piermont Waters 14 s. per dozen ; Boavia Attack 14 s. Goa Attack 12 s. Jamaica Rum and French Brandy 8 s. per Ganon ; Coffee , Tea , and Chocolate , at Prices in Proportion to their Goodness .
