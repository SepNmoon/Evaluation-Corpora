January 10 . Anne Hornby . I had been on an Errand last Wednesday Night , to the other Side of the Bridge , and as I was coming back about seven o'Clock of Night , I met a well-dressed young Woman , whom I afterwards heard was named Sarah , She asked me where I was going ? I told her I was going Home . She next enquired where I lived ? I said , I lived by the Old Spaw , near Clerkenwell Bridewell . Then she told me , she lived that Way too , and would go with me , but I must first go a little Way with her towards Gracechurch-street . I went with her 'till I came to a Pump , and there the two Prisoners at the Bar met us . She stepped a little on one Side with them , and then came up to me , and asked me if I wanted a Place ? I told them yes , if I could get into a civil Family . Upon this they took me up into a Court , but there being a Light there , they took me into the next , and then one of them said to the others , I believe my Mistress will like this young Woman , because she is so fresh coloured ; but ( says she to me ) you must pull off your Cloaths to see if they are clean . I said , I would not pull my Cloaths off ; Wo n't she , says one of them , - then d - mn the Bitch , give her a Drive on the Wind-pipe ; and immediately they put something soft into my Mouth , and took off this Gown , a checqu 'd Apron , a Pair of Stays , and my Quilted-Petticoat ; all which , the Prisoner London put into her Apron , and carry 'd away . The Woman that met me first went away with her , and the Prisoner Reynolds was to stay with me , 'till they came back with my Cloaths . I waited some time with Reynolds ; then I told her , I hoped they were not gone away with my Things . No , no , says Reynolds , they are only gone to see if your Cloaths are clean , - I 'll go and call them . So away she went , and I called after her ( as far as I could ) by the Name of Pat , which I had heard the other two call her by . I ca n't say which of them stripped me , but they were all about me , and held me up against the Wall , while they were doing it . When they had all left me , I went back the same Way I came crying and roaring ; and the People asked me if I should know the Persons again that had robbed me ? I said I should , and described them as well as I could . One of them , I said , had a black Gown on , and a Cast with her Eyes , and the other had a Scar in her Face . Somebody then said , such Persons lived in an Alley in Bishopsgate-street , and there the two Prisoners being found , I knew them immediately , and went with them to the Watch-house , where I was examined by the Constable , and because I had nobody to be bound for my Appearance the next Day , I was sent with them to the Counter , and Orders were sent , that I should be taken Care of ; but we being all put together , the Prisoners threatened me , and said , when I came before my Lord , I must say , I was very much in Liquor , and pulled off my Cloaths , and gave 'em away myself . The next Morning , a Man came into the Counter , and asked which was the Prosecutor ? I said I was . D - mn you , you B - ch , says he , What are you doing ? They wanted me to set my Hand to a Paper , and I told them I would , if I might have my Things again . Upon which , Martha London pulled off the checqu 'd Apron from her Sides , and sent for my Gown out of Pawn . The Petticoat , she said , was hung out of the Window when the Search was made after her , for fear it should be seen in the Room , and the Stays were hid under a Basket of Oranges . I was to have sign 'd the Paper they drew up , but as I had not all my Things again I did not . William Elliot , Constable . Last Wednesday Night I was on my Watch at Bishopsgate , and going my Rounds , I met three Watchmen , with the two Prisoners , and this Hornby . They told me , the two Girls , ( the Prisoners ) had committed a Street Robbery . Hornby was naked , all but her Shift and a coat , and a simple thing which she had wrapped round her Shoulders . I took them all to the Watch-house , and the Prisoners confessed that the Gown , and ( I think ) the Cloak were pawned at the Corner of Skinner-street . The least of the Prisoners desired to be made an Evidence , and told me , That the third Person who was concerned with them was gone over the Water . Prisoner London . I sell Oranges and Lemons , and was waiting at the Top of a Court for this Reynolds to come to me . About seven o'Clock she and the Prosecutrix , and Sarah Creech came to me . Creech told the Prosecutrix , she would help her to a Place , but she must see whether her Cloaths were clean or not ; and so she took off her Cloaths and put them into my Apron , then Creech and I went away and left Reynolds with the Prosecutrix . I pawned her Gown and Cloak for Six-pence at a Place where my Mother used to pawn her Things before she dy 'd After this , I went home to Mrs Thornton 's and bought a Two-penny Loaf ; and had not been at Home but a very little Time before the Prosecutrix came in She bid me herself pawn them , and buy some Victuals . Pris . Reynolds . I was going up to Cornhill , and met the Prosecutrix and Sal Creech . 'T was they persuaded the Girl to pull her Cloaths off They carried them away , and I staid a great while with her . At last she fell a-crying , and I called out , Pat London ; but not hearing her answer , I went home . London hung the Girl 's Petticoat out of the Window when the Watchman came , that it might not be seen , and the Stays we hid under a Basket of Oranges . Both Guilty . Death . The Jury recommended them to the Mercy of his Majesty . 70. Thomas Carter , of St. Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for stealing a Cheshire Cheese , weight 28 lb . value 1 s. in the Shop of William Bond , Jan. 11 . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 71 . 72. Charles Cockle , the Younger , and Ann Walker , of St. Paul 's Covent Garden , were indicted for assaulting George Mac Ben , in the House of Charles Cockle the Elder , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Silver Watch , value 5 l. and 6 s. in Money , Dec. 27 . Mac Ben . On the 27th of last Month , between 10 and 11 o'Clock at Night , I met that Woman at the Bar , near the Corner of Denmark Court . She asked me to give her a Pint of Ale , so we went to the White Hart , in that Court . She called for a Decanter of Ale , and as soon as the Ale was brought , the Landlord demanded his Money . It troubled me , to pay my Money before I had drunk the Liquor , and I was not willing to do it ; upon which the Woman Prisoner up with her Fist , and gave me a Blow in the Face . I got up and asked her the Reason of her striking me ? However , I paid for the Liquor , and forgetting the Dispute that had happened between her and me , I went up Stairs with her , into the Dining Room . I do n't know what Money I paid below Stairs , for I gave the Landlord a Shilling for what she and I had had there , and he gave me something out of it , which I put in my Pocket without looking at . We were no sooner got up Stairs , but she knocked with her Foot , and a young Girl brought up another Decanter of Ale , for which I refused to pay . We sat a little while , and then we agreed to go to Bed together . I had seven Shillings in my Pocket , and after all , I did not go to Bed with her , but she asked me for a shilling , and a shilling I gave her . Then she wanted to have my Watch , and made hard-drive at it , but I kept my Hand upon it ; she attempted to get it by Force , and struck me ; I struck her again , and upon that , the Prisoner Cockle came up , and halled me down Stairs by the Leggs , into a little Back Cellar , where she sat upon my Belly , and swore , with a Knife in her Hand , that she would cut my Throat . Cockle trail 'd me downStairs into the Cellar by the Heels , and there they took my Watch from me , and all the Silver and Copper I had in this Pocket . After this , I came up Stairs , and I thought if I went out of the House , they might say I lost my Watch and Money Abroad ; So I sat down , and call 'd for another Decanter of Ale ; and sometimes I was - fighting , - and sometimes I was - crying : - but knowing I had a Fob in the Hinder-part of my Breeches , with Money in it still , I called the Landlord , and asked him , If I could have a Bed there that Night ? Yes , says he , if you 'll pay for it before-hand . I had both Gold and Silver in my Fob ; so I took out some Silver , and paid a Shilling for a Bed . Then I went up Stairs , and put my Cloaths under the Sheets , and my Shoes under my Head . But I had not been three Minutes in Bed before the Woman Prisoner came up , and kiss 'd me , and wanted me to be great with her again but I called the Landlord up , and said , 't was very hard to pay for a Bed , and not have Liberty to lie quietly in it ; upon this he turned her down Stairs . In the Morning I got up , and went down ; but seeing no body stirring , I open 'd the Doors , and walk 'd an Hour and a Half in the Court before the Door . Then I went to the Blue Ball in the Neighbourhood , and sent for Mr. Cameron ; when he came , we went into the House , to see if I could get any Retaliation . They were for beating me again , but we got them before a Justice , and now let the Justice of the Law do what it thinks proper . Prisoners . When did you agree to pay a Shilling for a Bed ? Mac Ben . After I came up from the Cellar . Prisoners . What Time was it , when you was drawn down into the Cellar ? Mac Ben . Past Twelve o'Clock . Prisoners . Were not several People drinking in the Fore-Room ? Mac Ben . I saw no body there . Prisoners . How many Pair of Stairs do you say you was trail 'd down ? Mac Ben . Two Pair . Prisoners . Did you cry out when you was trailing down by the Heels into the Cellar ? Mac Ben . Yes , I did , indeed - manfully . Prisoners . What Time o'Night was it when you paid the Shilling for the Bed ? Mac Ben . About 1 o'Clock . Prisoners . Did any body attempt to hinder your going away ? Mac Ben . No ; no one at that Time . Prisoner Walker . Did not I go with you to a Publick House , between St. Clement 's Church Yard and Denmark-Court ? Mac Ben . No . Walker . Where did I take the Money out of your Pocket ? Mac Ben . In the Dining Room . Walker . I met him in St. Clement 's Church Yard , and I was going Home with some Candles . He went with me to the Door , and staid till I had delivered the Candles . I was forc 'd to go to a Publick-House with him ; for he said , if I did not go with him , he would make a Noise about the Door , and would say I was his Wife . How much Beer had you in the Dining-Room ? Mac Ben . Upon my Word , I do n't know , nor whether I paid for any thing in the Dining-Room . Prisoner Cockle . Did not you come the next Day to the House , and offer to spend a Guinea , if the Landlord could help you to the Watch ? Mac Ben . Yes . Cockle . Did you charge me with any thing then ? Mac Ben . Yes ; I did . A Witness . The Prisoner is a Taylor , and his Father keeps a Publick-House : I was there on the 27th of December . I had been there two or three Days , copying out some Accounts . The Prosecutor came in with the Woman about 11 o'clock , and went up Stairs . Presently I heard a Disturbance , and the Landlord went with me into the Dining-Room , where I saw the Prisoner Cockle standing by the Fire-Side . The Woman and the Prosecutor were struggling together , on one Side of the Room , and the young Fellow went to part them , upon which the Prosecutor turned about , and thrust his Fist into the Man 's Face , and said to the Woman , - You B - h , you have got my Watch . The Landlord desired him not to make a Disturbance , and ordered his Son to bring the Prosecutor down Stairs . Accordingly the young Man took him by the Left-Hand and by the Collar , and brought him down Stairs , then he let him go , and he ran into a Nook behind the Kitchen-Door , and stood there about a Minute and a Half , making a great Noise . Several People being in the House , the Father desired his Son not to let him stand making such a Noise there ; so he brought him by the Arm into the Room , and set him upon a Bench . He said again , the Woman had robbed him , but did not mention a Word of the young Fellow . The Landlord told him , if the Woman had robb 'd him , she should not stir , if he insisted upon it . The Woman then struck him a Slap in the Face , and said , You Villain , how can you charge me with such a Thing ! Then the Prosecutor immediately said to her - Go about your Business - you have not robbed me . He was quite mad and drunk ; one would have thought he had really been a Mad Fellow . When the Watchman came Twelve , the Landlord threaten 'd to send him to the Round-House , which made him change his Tone again , and he declared , the Woman had not done him any Injustice , upon which she went out , and returned again in a Quarter of an Hour . In the mean time , he got up , talked freely , and paid the Landlord 7 d. When the Woman returned , he began to be sweet upon her , and she comply 'd with him . Then I thought the Disturbance had been all over , and left him in the Drinking-Room among other Company , about One o'Clock . John Ray , Constable . The Prosecutor brought me a Warrant in the Morning against the Prisoner Cockle : I went with him to the House , and found the young Fellow in his Shirt by the Fire . The Prosecutor did not give me Charge of him , so he went away . I asked the Father , where he was gone ? He told me his Son knew I had a Warrant against him , but he was only gone to shift him , and he called to him , to make haste , for the Constable waited for him ; he answer 'd he would come presently , and did so ; then I took him to my House , and the Prosecutor offer 'd to make it up for 3 l. several times . The Woman heard I had Justice Frazier 's Warrant out against her , and she came to my House , and surrender 'd herself . Cockle the Elder confirm 'd the Account the first Witness gave in Behalf of the Prisoners , adding , That the Prosecutor never was in the Cellar at all , and that the Prisoner Walker , after her coming in the second time , was desired by the Prosecutor to come and sit down by him , which she did , and that in the Morning , when he went out , he heard him , and called out to him , to shut the Door after him . Mary Cockle said the Prosecutor refused to pay his Reckoning , which put the Woman into a Passion , because she supposed she must pay it if he did not : In every other Circumstance she corroborated the former Witnesses . Anne Robinson was there that Night , and said the Prosecutor was not in the Cellar at all ; if he had been carry 'd there , she must have seen it . And that he himself declared that Night he had not been robb 'd , and bid the Woman go about her Business . Mr. Justice Frazier . When the Prosecutor came before me , I understood that the Robbery was committed in a Ground-Room : I sent to see the Situation of the Cellar , and found it full of Water . Then he could not be positive whether it was done in the Cellar , or not ; but he was positive to the Man , he said ; yet he wanted to make it up . There was a third Person with him when I examined him , a Woman , whom I could not cause to be now produced . - Ballard ; William Sympson , and William Mitchell , gave the Prisoner Cockle the Character of a civil , honest , young Fellow . Alexander Campbell gave an Account , that Mac Ben came to him , on the 27th of December , in the Morning , with his Face bloody and scratch 'd , and that he told him he had been robb 'd and almost murder 'd at the White-Hart in Denmark Court . He had known the Prosecutor seven or eight Years , and took him to be an honest Man . Both Acquitted . 73.

Catherine Demay , of London , Spinster , was indicted , for that she , not having God before her Eyes , & c. and contriving and intending one Michael Dunn , with Poison to kill and murder , on the 15th of December , in the Parish of St. Martin , Ludgate , a great Quantity of Cantharides , being deadly Poison , into a certain Liquor , made of Coffee and Water boiled together , of her Malice aforethought , did put and mix , she well knowing the same to be Poison ; and afterwards that she the said Catherine , in the Parish aforesaid , the Poison aforesaid , and so mixed as aforesaid , in the Liquor aforesaid , of her Malice aforethought , to him the said Dunn did give , and cause to be given , to drink and swallow down : And afterwards , on the 15th of December , in the Parish aforesaid , he the said Dunn , the said Poison , so mixed as aforesaid , by the Procurement of her , the said Demay , did drink and swallow down : whereupon , he the said Dunn , by the Poison aforesaid , so as aforesaid taken , was sick and distemper 'd in his Body , and of the Sickness caused by the said Poison from the 15th to the 18th of December , in the Parish aforesaid , and in St. Margaret 's Westminster , did languish , and languishingly lived ; on which 18th of December , of the Poison , and of the Sickness occasioned thereby , he died , in the Parish of St. Margaret aforesaid . So the Jurors say , That she , the said Demay , him the said Dunn , of her Malice aforethought , did kill and murder . She was a second Time charged , by vertue of the Coroner 's Inquisition . The Council for the Prosecution having open 'd the Indictment , and the Evidence , the Witnesses were called . William Charlton . The Prisoner was a Lodger in my House : I am a Barber and Peruke-maker , in Cock-Court , on Ludgate-Hill : The Deceased was at that time my Journey-man . On the 15th of December she called down Stairs for Michael , ( the Deceased ) I told her , he was not at home , and asked her , what she wanted with him ? She said , if I would not take it as an Affront , there was a Pot of very good Coffee for him . No , Madam , says I , I shall not be affronted , 't is a better Breakfast than I shall give him . As soon as he came in , I told him Mrs. Demay had brought him some Coffee , and bid him get some Bread and Butter , and make himself a Toast , and eat with it . I was there from the time of her leaving the Coffee , till the Deceased came in ; then he drank it , and threw away the Grounds himself . Counc . How soon did he begin to complain ? Charlton . He did not complain to me , till Sunday Morning , and the Coffee was given him on the Friday Morning . I sent him on an Errand on Sunday Morning , and when he returned , he complained of being cold and chilly , but did not say a Word to me that he suspected the Coffee had done him any Harm . He had a Brother , who lives at Westminster , and he told me he would take a Walk to see him ; and from that Time he never came Home ; but sent me word on Monday Morning , that he would come as soon as he could , with the Hair I order 'd him to bring from thence . I expected him home on Tuesday , but he did not some : His Brother came at Night , and told me he was very ill , and that the Doctors could not prescribe for him , till they knew how he was taken . He was dead , I find , at this Time , but the Brother wanted to hear what I could say . I told him , I never heard him complain till Sunday Counc . How long had he liv 'd with you ? Charlton . He had work 'd with me six Months , within a Week ; and I ca n't say he ever seemed to ail any thing in all that Time . As to the Prisoner , she lived in the House when I took it ; I know nothing of her Condition , nor of any Intimacy between her and the Deceased , any farther than Civility ; he used to go on her Errands , when he was not employ 'd in Business . I thought she looked on him no otherwise than as any body may do on their Servant . Mrs. Charlton . The Prisoner lodged in our House , and the Deceased was our Journeyman . I was in the Sight of all that passed on this Occasion : When she call 'd him , he was not at home ; so she put the Coffee-pot into my Son 's Hand , and he set the Pot down before the Fire ; in a Minute he came in , and I took the Pot , and gave it him on the Tea-Board ; and from the Time of her bringing it , to the Time I gave it him , I am sure nothing was done to it ; he drank two Dishes , and in the third Dish he said he thought there was a bit of a Tea-leaf ; when he had said this , he drank that Dish likewise ; and as soon as he had done , I took the Pot , and was going to empty the Grounds ; but he took it from me , and emptied them into the Court : Then I scalded it out , and set it away . Counc . When did you hear him complain first ? Mrs. Charlton . Not till Sunday . I never heard him complain of the Coffee at all . On Sunday he said he felt himself very weak , and complain 'd of being cold , but gave no Hint of the Occasion . Counc . Did you see him any more between that Time , and the Time of his Death ? Mrs. Charlton . No ; On Sunday , after he had complained , he said he would go and take a Walk to his Brother 's : I told him , if he was not well , he had better not go so far : He had been laughing , about Half an Hour before , with Customers in the Shop . We used to let him go on her Errands , because she had no body else to go , and we thought she might be afraid of going out herself , and she used now and then to give him a small Matter , such as a Draught of Ale : I never saw any Familiarity between them . Q . When you told him it was a great way to go , what did he say ? Mrs. Charlton . He said he was not sick , and would be at Home again about Ten o'Clock . Brian Dunn . The Deceased was my Brother ; I happened not to come home that Sunday before eight or nine o'Clock . I found him sitting on an Alehouse Bench , a few Doors from my House ; he told me he was very ill , so I got him some Ale and Treacle ( for I thought he had only got Cold ) then I went home with him , and put him into my Bed , and covered him up close , and he sweat heartily . After sweating , he was very dry ; so I got him some Water and put a Toast into it : He drank a good Draught ; then I got him a dry , aired Shirt , and sat myself down again by the Fire . By and by he called out hastily , - Brother ! Brother ! help me up , or else I shall die in the Bed ! ( This was about Twelve o'Clock ) I ran to him , - Lord have Mercy on me , says he , I am a dead Man ! You 're dead-hearted , said I , what 's the Matter with you ? I do n't know , says he , I believe I have got a Fever . After this , he could not rest in Bed , so he got up , and put my great Coat on , and walked about the Room . Then I told him I was sleepy , and would lie down ; desiring him , if he should find himself worse , to call me . About Day-light , he called me , and told me , he was very ill , very thirsty , and ready to be choaked . I got him something to drink , but then he could not drink any Liquor at all . I asked him what was the Reason he could not drink , when he was so very thirsty ? Why , says he , the very Sight of it choaks me ! - I have a Burning within me , but can not drink . I then got a clean Rag , and dipped it into such Liquids as I had , Water-gruel , & c. and with the Rag , I moistened his Lips . I was very much surprized at the Condition he was in , so I told him I would go and fetch Mr. Varney the Apothecary to him ; he begged of me not to leave him alone ; but I went , and while I was gone , he run out of Doors to an Ale-house . and clapping both his Hands upon the Bar-post , he begged the Woman of the House to help him , - or else he should die ! When the Apothecary came , he asked him if he had not been meddling with Girls , and desired him not to be afraid to tell us , if it was so . I requested of my Brother not to be afraid of me , for I would do all I could to help him . In answer to this , he told us , he had not been well since Friday Morning ; that Mrs. Demay gave him that Morning some Coffee ; that he saw something like a Tea-Leaf in it , but square ; yet as he thought it warm and good , he drank it ; that in about three Hours and a Half afterwards he found a very strange Alteration in himself , - ( The Witness here made Use of such Expressions , in his Account of the Disorder , and the Effects of the Poison , as Decency obliges us to suppress . ) I begged very hard , that he would let me know the Truth of the Matter , and he said , - the d - mn 'd B - ch Demay gave him the Coffee , and he felt ( the Effects of ) it , in about three Hours and a Half ; and that the Coffee she gave him was the Occasion of his Death . He died on Monday . Prisoner . Had not the Deceased been drinking ; when you saw him on Sunday Night ? Dunn . He had been in the House , where I found him on the Bench , and the Landlady had offered to make him a hot Pint . I believe he had drank something at that House . Prisoner . Have not you declared you 'd spend 100 l. to hang me ? Dunn . I have said , I would spend 100 l. to have Right done to my Brother , and that I would hang her , if I could . William Bishop I saw the Deceased in his Master 's Shop , on the Evening of the Friday he took the Coffee . He told me he was very ill , and found an Uncommon Ailment upon him , and was very cold , and in a shivering Condition . I saw him likewise on Saturday , but on Sunday he told me again , that he was very ill ; - very cold and shivering . He was then going to shave a Customer of his Master 's in Fleet-lane , and he afterwards came and shaved me , and told me , the Gentleman where he had been , had given him a Glass of Brandy , and he thought himself a little better , but still he continued ill. After Dinner he came to me , to borrow my great Coat , to go to his Brother 's , because he was cold , and from this Time I saw no more of him . Counc . What were his Complaints to you ? Bishop . His Complaint was in the lower Part of his Body , & c & c. He said , there was something in the Coffee he had drank like Green Tea Leaves , or Green Tea Dust ; and he thought it was the Coffee that had occasioned the Disorder . Prisoner 's Q . Did he say nothing else ; Bishop . He told me on the Monday or Tuesday Fortnight before this happened , that he had lain with a Woman in Drury Lane ; and he was afraid he had got it , and I understood it , - that he had got the Clap . Bridget Dunn . The Deceased was my Nephew ; I was with him in his Sickness . His Brother came for me , on Monday about Twelve o'Clock , and told me , he believed his Brother Michael was dying . I went with him , and found the Deceased in a sad Condition , upon a Man 's Back . I asked him what was the Matter ? Do n't be surprized , Aunt , says he . What 's the Matter with you , says I , are you mad ? I suppose you have eat something that does not agree with you . Aye ! says he , that 's the Thing , I had three Dishes of Coffee for my Breakfast , which has killed me ; and in the last , I saw something like Green Tea Leaves . Michael , says I , tell me if you have not been among the Wenches , - if you have , I will get you cured . No , says he , - I shall not live 'till 12 o'Clock at Night , and , as I hope to be saved , I never knew a Woman in my Life ; and in about three Hours he died . He bid me kiss him , and told me he should not die by himself , he should die with his dear Brother . I asked him if he used to breakfast with the Woman ? He said no , he had never breakfasted with her before , nor , as he hoped to be saved , had he ever had any Thing to do with a Woman in his Life . Thomas Duberly gave an Account , That he saw the Deceased on Monday Morning . That about 9 or 10 o'Clock he told him he should die , and then the Apothecary was sent for . That he told him , he was afraid he was in Love , or had been dabbling among the Girls . That the Deceased reply 'd , - no , - upon his Soul he never in his Life had meddled with any Woman ; and throwing his Arms round the Witness , he said , - I have drank three Dishes of Coffee , which were given me by Mrs. Demay , two of them I drank greedily , and in the third I saw a great many Spangles , and something like Green Tea Leaves ; and since that , I have never been right ; for about three Hours after I found an Alteration in myself , & c. [ The Witness here gave an Account of the Disorder , and the Effects of the Poison . ] Afterwards my Body wasted away , that nothing could be like it ; and if ever I see her again , - d - mn the B - ch , I 'll murder her . That this was the Day he died , and that he continued in the same Story to the last . That the Deceased declared he was in his Senses , and knew what he said ; and though at some Times he seemed to be light headed , yet at other Times , he walked about the Room , and talked very sensibly . Ann Dewsberry saw the Deceased about eight o'Clock , on Monday Morning . She gave much the same Account of the Disorder he was in ; and added , That she had an Opportunity of taxing him with having been among lewd Women , when she was left for some time alone with him ; but the Deceased solemnly protested he had never touched a Woman in his Life , and told her , the Coffee given him by her who lodged in his Master 's House , was the Cause of the Disaster ; and that he drank two Dishes greedily , and in the third he found something swimming like Green Tea Leaves , but not thinking any Harm , he drank that likewise . She likewise declared , That within half an Hour of his Death , he said , - That Coffee had done his Business , and if he lived to see That - ( calling her a hard Name ) he would do her Business ; and in the Opinion of this Witness , he was in his Senses to the Minute of his Death , though he had enough upon him to have made him mad . John Dewsberry saw the Deceased on the Sunday Se'enight before , in perfect Health ; he saw him no more 'till the time he saw him sick at his Brother 's , which was about 3 o'Clock the Day he died . He added , That about 7 o'Clock he grew worse , and called out for his Brother ; That Mr. Tagg the Surgeon was sent for , but before he came , he was struck speechless and died . Mr. Varney , Apothecary . I came to the Deceased about 9 o'Clock on Monday Morning , and found his Stomach greatly disordered ; an Uneasiness in his Throat , and a violent Strangury upon him . I put some Questions to him , which he answered , by saying he had never known a Woman in his Life , and desiring immediately to speak only to his Brother and me , he told us a Person had given him some Coffee , in a Dish of which he perceived something like a Leaf to float , and that presently after he had drank the Coffee he found himself strangely disordered , & c. & c. I advised them to send for a Physician , and accordingly Dr. Connel was sent for , but he died about 8 at Night . Upon opening him , we found the Heart and Stomach vastly enflamed , and something - Powder-like , was taken out of his Stomach , but we could not distinguish what it was . Counc . What do you think was the Occasion of his Death ? Mr. Varney . I think nothing could produce such Circumstances , or be the Occasion of it , but Cantharides . Such Symptoms are likely to ensue , on a Person 's taking a Dose of them , and on that only , in my Opinion . Cantharides taken in an undue Quantity ; are-Poison . I have been an Apothecary twenty two Years , and am acquainted with the Operation of Cantharides . Prisoner 's Q . Whether it is not usual in some Stages of the French Disease to take Cantharides ? Mr. Varney . I have heard it is . Prisoner 's Q . If Cantharides be given in such a Quantity as to be Poison , how soon do they operate ? Mr. Varney . Generally in about twelve Hours . Prisoner 's Q . If a Person take such a Dose of them as to produce such Effects , is it likely he should go about from Friday to Sunday , without complaining ? Mr. Varney . I should think he must complain sooner ? Mr. Tagg , Surgeon . I was sent for to the Deceased two Hours and a Half before he died , and found him raving , by reason of his Pain , but sensible . The Nerves were affected , and he was almost Convulsive ; I was forced to have three or four People to hold him while I bled him . The Symptoms the Witnesses have described , are the Effect of Cantharides ; and if they are improperly given , they are absolutely Poison . On opening the Body , we found the Stomach vesicated , and the Skin of the internal Coat hung in Flaps , as if a large Blister had been made and broke . There was another not broke , filled with a dirty Mucus , which is unnatural . I ca n't say I saw the Wings of the Cantharides , but it seems he had had large Evacuations , upwards and downwards , and the Mucus was fixed by the Salts of the Cantharides : The Veins of the Heart were very turgid and full ; and the Viscera were eroded , as well as the Stomach , down to the Bottom . There were no Symptoms of the Foul Disease ; if there had , I must have seen them . I take it , that nothing but taking an Over-dose of Cantharides was the Cause of his Death . I found him in a Sort of sensible Madness ; not as a light-headed Man in a Fever , but he had Intervals ; he open 'd his Eyes , and talked to People ; but at the same time was so strong in Motion , that he appeared as if he knew not what he did ; but in a few Minutes he would recover , and speak to the People in the Room . The Nerves were concern 'd , and consequently the Brain must be affected . I ca n't say I examined the Body so as to be able to swear he never had had the Foul Disease ; but I saw nothing of it . Prisoner 's Q . How long Time do you allow before Cantharides will operate ? Mr. Tagg . 'T is according to the Quantity taken . We allow Twelve Hours the Outside . I do n't believe a Person could live 48 Hours with too large a Dose ; for the Warmth of the Stomach would make them operate sooner . If so great a Quantity be taken as to occasion Death , it will descend , and affect the Kidneys and Ureters , and occasion , & c. & c. Prisoner 's Q . People know the Use of them outwardly - if they have the same Effect internally , can you imagine a Person will be able to go about from Friday Morning to Sunday , if so large a Quantity should have been taken inwardly ? Mr. Tagg . Yes , I believe he might . Doctor Connel . I was sent for to this unhappy young Fellow , about Two Hours before he died . When I came in , he could hardly answer any Questions . Presently he would come to himself and complain of Tortures in , & c. I asked him some Questions ; in answer to which he said - as he hop 'd to be sav 'd , he had never had any Commerce with Women - but about three Days ago he drank some Coffee , and had never been well since . [ The same Account of the Coffee was given as hath been before mentioned . ] I asked the People about him if , & c. & c. they said , yes , & c. & c. which I thought was the Effect of the Cantharides , and I sent for a Surgeon to bleed him , and was going to order him some cooling Emulsions ; but the Apothecary told me , he could not drink , he had an Hydrophobia upon him , an Abhorrence of Liquids . I was so convinced it was the Effect of Cantharides , that I ordered him a Dose of Camphire , which is the best thing against the Symptoms , which are the inseparable Effects produced from such a Quantity taken . Prisoner 's Q . Was it possible for a Man to go about from Friday to Sunday after this ? Dr. Connel . I believe he might : According to the Temperament of the Stomach , and the Quantity taken , he might go about a Week . I have administer 'd Cantharides , and have been acquainted with the Medicine fifteen Years : I think a Man may go on eight Days before he comes to such a Condition . Prisoner . My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury , Never did a Person more innocent appear at this Bar . I never had any Malice or I'll-will to the Fellow in my Days : If he did me any little Courtesy , I paid him in some Way or other ; if he fetch 'd the Coffee , I said I would give him the Grounds ; if I had put any thing into the Pot , is it reasonable to imagine I should have delivered it into Mr. Charlton 's Hands ? I never knew of any Design against me 'till the Time I went to make Mr. Charlton some Acknowledgment for going out of his House without Warning , & c. and that I never laid my Eyes on the Wretch from the Time I gave him the Coffee 'till I went to Market on Saturday , and that Day I had a Chair-woman with me till Twelve at Night ; he was singing at his Work that Night at Eleven . Mary Winnel . On Friday the 15th of December the Prisoner invited me to breakfast with her : When I came there the Tea-Kettle was upon the Fire ; she ask 'd me , whether I chose Coffee or Tea ' I told her , I chose Coffee ; ( but I have heard she does not drink Coffee herself once in a Twelvemonth ) upon which she borrow 'd a Coffee Pot , and the Deceased ( I understand ) was sent for the Coffee . After we had drunk two Dishes a-piece , she said , - Here 's a Piece of Oat-cake left , and I expect Mrs. Buckley to come presently , so she went to Mrs. Buckley 's Shop ( just at the Corner ) for half an Ounce more , and Mrs. Buckley brought it herself , but her Customers coming in , she was call 'd away ; the Prisoner then said , - 'T is pity the Coffee should be thrown away , so she pour 'd some Water out of the Tea-Kettle into the Pot , and as she was going to put the Coffee into the Pot , I told her , I wanted to see her Dining room ; she went with me , and in two Minutes Time we came out again , for she was afraid the Coffee would have boil 'd over , then she took it , and carry 'd it down for the Servant . I can take my Oath she put nothing in it but the Coffee in my Sight : She is as innocent of the Thing as the Child unborn ; for I drank of that which was made of the last half Ounce , as well as that which was made first Mary Buckley . I live over against the Prisoner 's Lodging , and have known her half a Year . On Friday , Dec. 15. she came and desired me to bring half an Ounce of Coffee ; I went with it myself , and she asked me to stay and drink a Dish , I told her I would come again presently , but I could not then stay . She is a Person of good Reputation , and was above having any Intimacy with the Deceased : Whenever he went of an Errand for her , she always gave him something . Counc . Did you drink any of this Coffee ? Buckley . No . Jane Marsh . I live with Mrs. Storey , ( the next Witness ) and chair 'd for the Prisoner the Saturday following : The Deceased was well , and merry , and perfectly in Health , between Eleven and Twelve at Night ; he was singing , and complain 'd of nothing , but seem 'd as well as I was . Mrs. Sey . I have known the Prisoner seven Year 's she is a very good-natured Woman , and ready to serve any one . 'T is a Law-Suit that laid her under unhappy Circumstances . On Friday the 15th of December she came to my House about One o'Clock , and staid till Eleven . I desired her to let the last Witness have her Work , and she consented . At Eleven , she went Home with the Prisoner , and I saw no more of her till Saturday Night . I know nothing of the Fact ; but I know Mrs. Demay would have nothing to do with such a Creature , unless it was to do him a Charitable Act . Dorothy Hall , the Prisoner 's Sister , din 'd at Mrs. Storey 's the 15th of December , with the Prisoner , and confirm 'd Storey 's Evidence ; adding , that the Prisoner came to see them again on Monday , and went from their House to St James 's . William Watson had known the Prisoner ever since last May was a Twelve-month ; she lodged in his House , till her Misfortune came on her by a Law-suit . While she liv 'd in his House , she used frequently to give his Apprentice ( Arthur Norson ) any little Matter she had left . James Gilstrop . About a Month before this 15th of December , I took a Walk with the Deceased , and as we were going along , he said , - G - d , Doctor , I have got the foul Distemper , and shew 'd me a Box of Pills ; telling me , they were to cure him . I have been with him several Times , and once , at a Publick House in Moorfields , we were to see two Girls , but their Father and Mother happen 'd to be at Home , else we were to have gone up Stairs with them ; I saw the Girls were full of Dimples too . I live at Mr. Grange 's , a Hair-cutter , in Great Russel-street , Covent-Garden , and the Deceased had been my Fellow Servant there . He told me his Case , and shew 'd me the Pills out of Fun , and in a bragging Way . William Phipps got acquainted with the Deceased about five Months before his Death ; He gave Account , that about a Month before he dy 'd , he told him he had the foul Distemper upon him , and show 'd him a Phial , & c. & c. with a little Liquor in it , which he said was given him by a Doctor at the other End of the Town . John Thompson deposed , That about a Month or five Weeks before the 15th of December , he saw a Box of Pills and a Phial in the Deceased 's Possession , which he told him was to cure a young Man of the aforesaid Malady . He added , that he came to shave his ( the Witness ' ) Head the very Sunday before he dy 'd ; that he seem 'd very well , and the Witness producing some Brandy for the Deceased to rub his Head with to prevent his catching Cold , the Deceased said , - Put as much in your Inside , Master , and you 'll never catch Cold ; upon which the Witness gave him a Dram . Prisoner . I would desire to know , if Phipps was not once with him in Drury-Lane , in Company with a Woman ? Phipp . Yes . I live with a Brandy Merchant in Bridges-street , where he came to see me , and I treated him with three Gills of Shrub and Water ; then we went to the Strong Beer ; after this we went to Tom King ' and from thence we went staggering into Drury Lane , where he got one Girl , and I got another , and we carry 'd them into a House in a Court in Drury Lane ; when we came out , he told me he had given his Girl the Clap . C. 'T is necessary that the whole Truth should be spoke ; but you was guilty of a very ill Thing , and 't is for your Interest to let this be a Warning to you . Matthew Stevens gave an Account , that about a Month or ten Weeks ago , the Deceased asked him if he could recommend him to one who could cure him , & c. telling him he had lain abroad last Night . Samuel Farthing depos 'd , That he liv 'd with a Chymist on Ludgate-hill ; and that about six or eight Weeks ago , he brought him a little Note , on which was wrote , Elixir Antivenereum , Uncia una , and wanted the Witness to give him a little for a Friend , which he refus 'd . Mr. William Morgan gave an Account that in some Stages of the Distemper , 't was usual to give Cantharides , and a Tincture was made of them for that Purpose . It was his Opinion , That if they were taken inwardly by themselves , they would operate immediately ; his Reason was , That he himself had been obliged to make an Emulsion for the Strangury , in two or three Hours after the Application of a Blister , He believed terrible Symptoms , such as Shiverings , Vomitings , & c must appear in two Hours ; and farther , he knew a Case , where six Drops of the Tincture ( in which Cantharides are corrected with Camphire ) produced such a Disorder , that the Patient died , & c. This Witness had known the Prisoner many Years ; he took her to be a Person of Reputation , and said her Business was making Habits , and Manteels , and had some little Income beside . He added , That the Deceased had had a Vomit given him before he died , That it was not improbable , That might Irritate the Stomach , and enflame it ; That he had enquired of the Surgeon who opened the Body , whether they had inspected the Ureters ? That the Surgeon said no - for if he could take upon him to say , the Inflamation was occasioned by Cantharides , there was no Occasion for any farther Enquiry . Mr. Brumpton said 't was not usual to give Cantharides alone ; that he had made Experiments upon two Dogs , and found the Symptoms appear in less than six Hours . Francis Skelborn , and Elizabeth Johnson gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest , virtuous Woman , and Johnson said , she had some little Income to live upon , beside her Business Acquitted . 77.

On the 3d of October , in the Liberty of St. Martin 's le Grand , in and upon Catherine Walgrave , an Infant under the Age of 10 Years , viz . of the Age of 3 Years and 10 Months , feloniously did make an Assault and her the said Catherine , wickedly , & c. did carnally know and abuse . Thomas Walgrave . We found the Child out of Order ; she had a Swelling in the Groin ; which increasing , we sent it to a Surgeon , who sent for me ; when I came to his House , I had there the Opinion of two Surgeons that the Child was foul It was Matter of great Concern to me , and I suspected the Prisoner , who was my Apprentice . I taxed him with abusing the Child , and he fell down upon his Knees , and owned he had abused her three Times for Satisfaction in his own lustful Way , in the Garret . He would have signed the Confession he had made , but we did not insist upon it . John Hayes , Surgeon . On the 11th of November , Mr. Walgrave sent the Child to me by the Prisoner . I found a Bubo on one Side of the Groin , and an Inflamation on the other , & c. & c. She was very much ulcerated and lacerated , & c. & c. I asked the Prisoner how long the Infant had complained ? He said , - a great while , he could not tell how long . I knew her Ailment , so I sent for her Father , and assured him , his Child had the Foul Distemper . I had Doctor Bartlet 's Opinion too , and he concurr 'd with me . This Witness confirmed Mr. Walgrave 's Testimony with relation to the Confession of the Prisoner , and said further , that there were several large Ulcers on the and that the Child was now under the Care of Mr. Dansie in the Hospital . Elizabeth Walgrave confirmed the former Evidence ; as likewise did John Martin ; he adding , That he asked the Prisoner ( when he made the Confession ) whether the Child did not cry ? and he answered , No , she could not . Ruth Norton proved the Prisoner 's Confession , and said , the Prisoner told her , he prevented the Child from crying out . William Richardson gave an Account , that the Prisoner ran away when the Matter was discovered , and confirmed the other Witnesses with respect to the Prisoner 's Confession when he was taken ; adding farther , That , to his Knowledge , Mr. Walgrave had paid for the Prisoner 's being cured twice of the Foul Disease . Thomas Hopper deposed , That after he had heard the Prisoner had made a Confession , Mr. Walgrave called him ( the Witness ) into the Room , and he heard Walgrave say , - John , in case you 'll confess the Truth before Mr. Hopper , I will be favourable to you . And upon that , the Prisoner confessed as before related . Prisoner . My Master said he would be favourable to me , if I would confess , and I depended on his Mercy . Guilty , Death . 81.

On Wednesday Night , the 20th of December , I was in Russel-street , against the Rose Tavern Door , when the People were coming out of the Play-house ; and I saw a Gentleman going to hand some Ladies into a Chariot , the Prisoner was behind him , and this Man ( the next Witness ) was before him ; as he was getting into the Chariot , the Prisoner snatch 'd the Sword from his Side , and both he and his Companion ran a-cross the Way ; the Gentleman immediately turn 'd about , and ask 'd me , if I had not taken his Sword ; but I went with him into the Rose Tavern , and a Gentleman , spoke to my Character : The Gentleman 's Name is Cotton , but I have not seen him since that Time . I have seen the Prisoner at the Play-house , almost every Night , picking Pockets . James Mattocks . The Prisoner and I , and another , that Night , went to the Corner of Norfolk-street , and there we snatch 'd from a Gentleman 's Side a Silver-hilted Sword , which we carry 'd home and knock 'd to Pieces . Then we went to the Play , and as the Gentleman was delivering the Ladies into a Coach , the Prisoner snatch 'd away his Sword , and next Morning we broke it , and melted it down into a Bar , in a three-corner 'd Pot , with a Charcoal Fire , and the Prisoner sold it to a Silver-smith , by a Pastry-cook 's , near Fleet-ditch . I saw him take it , and melt it : The Gripe of the Sword I think was gilt ; and both this and that which we had taken before , were melted together . The Name of the Person concern 'd with us is Hussar , but I do n't know his other Name ; and I always knew the Prisoner by the Name of Jemmy the Drummer ; I did not know his Surname was James before . Prisoner . I never saw this Man but twice before in my Life . I have none to speak for me but God and myself . Guilty , Death . 89. Thomas Easter was indicted for assaulting Samuel Mills and John Hill on the King 's Highway , putting them in Fear , & c. and taking from the said Mills , half a Guinea , and 10 s. in Silver , and 15 s. from the said Hill , June 30 . Mr. Mills . In the Month of June ( last ) Mr. Hill and I took a Ride out for the Air , about Six in the Evening : To avoid the Dust , we went up a Lane call 'd the Devil 's Lane , in the Way from Lower Holloway to Crouch-End ; upon the Turn of an Elbow in the Lane , the Prisoner presented himself , and at a little Distance , saluted us with a Volley of Oaths , commanding us to stand : We thought proper to obey ; so he came up to me first , swore again , and demanded my Money , holding his Hat in his left Hand , and his Bridle and Pistol in the right ; I gave him what Silver I had , but he told me , he must have more , so I gave him Half a Guinea , and told him I had no more ; then he demanded my Watch , and upon my assuring him I had none , he left me , and went to Mr. Hill ; I saw Mr. Hill give him some Silver and a Key , the Key he desired the Prisoner to return . I know him perfectly well ; his Usage made an Impression upon me : D - mn your Blood , - you 're a dead Man , - I 'll shoot you through the Head , & c was the Language he made use of . He had another Wig on when I saw him in New Prison , yet I pick 'd him out from all the People who were there . He had on when he robb 'd us , a light natural Wig , and his Countenance made an Impression on my Mind . Mr. Hill . On the 30th of June , I believe it was half an Hour after Six , Mr. Mills and I were riding out for the Air , and , to avoid the Dust , we turn 'd into a back Lane , called the Devil 's Lane , we had not got above ten Poles into the Lane , but I saw the Prisoner , and said to Mr. Mills , - That Man looks like a Rogue ; he laugh 'd at me : But when he came up , he presented a Pistol : 't was bigger than a common Pistol , but not so big as a Horse-pistol . Mr. Mills was robb 'd first , and I next : When he had got his Money , he demanded mine , and I gave him what Money I had , and a Key , and a Pocket-piece ; I asked him to give me the Key again , he d - mned me , and gave it me ; when he had got my Money , he demanded my Watch , but I had pluck 'd the String of it into my Breeches , and told him I had none ; so I did not lose that . When I saw him in New Prison , I knew him perfectly well , and so did Mr. Mills . Prisoner . What Sort of a Horse did I ride ? Mr. Hill . I think it was a bay Horse . He had no Neck-cloth on , and his Coat was unbutton 'd , which shew 'd his red Waistcoat . When he came up to us , he pull 'd his Pistol out of his Leather Breeches . He had grey Stockings on , and a light natural Wig , - no Curl at all in it , - such an one as People of his Profession ( generally ) wear . He was two Minutes in robbing Mr. Mills ; I look 'd him full in the Face , and the Sun shone bright , all the Time . Prisoner . I think it hard to take People 's Lives away , when they are innocent of the Matter . Guilty , Death . 90 , 91. Thomas Davis and * Samuel Piper were indicted for stealing nine Silver Buckles , val . 35 s. the Goods of John Martin , Nov. 26 . Both Guilty . * Piper , was try 'd in December , Sessions 1737 , with William Hardesty , for robbing Charles Clark on the High-way , and was acquitted . See Sessions Book , No . I. page 10 . They were a second Time indicted for stealing a Silver Watch , val . 4 l. and a Silver Chain , val . 7 s and 6 d. the Goods of Abraham Poteira , from his Person , Octo . 30 . Abraham Poteira . I lost my Watch last Lord Mayor 's Day ; it was pull 'd out of my Pocket in the Street , over against the great Toy-Shop at the Corner of St. Paul 's Church-yard ; I do n't know who did it , but I felt it go , and somebody push 'd me at the same Time . When I got home , I told a Chair-woman that works in my Master 's House the Story , she went home , and came again in the Afternoon , and inform 'd me , that a Man who sold Rabbets in the Streets had seen a Watch , which was taken out of a Frenchman 's Pocket , sold that Morning . The Constable has got it in his Possession . Tho Sutherland . Tom Davis , Piper and I , went out last Lord Mayor 's Day , with a Design to get what we could in the Crowd , and met this Frenchman . We were all as close together as we could be , Piper took the Watch out of his Pocket , and drop 'd it , and Tom Davis pick 'd it up : The Gentleman miss 'd it in a Minute , and turn 'd about ; which was the Reason that Piper dropp 'd it , lest it should be taken upon him ; but when Davis had taken it up , he went off , and we follow 'd him , and overtook him . Then we went all together into Chick Lane , where we met John Miller , who offer 'd us 25 s. for it at an Ale-house in the Lane , but we wanted more Money for it : At last we all went to the Angel in Holborn , and there we took his Money for it , and had about six Shillings a-piece in Money , beside Liquor . I ca n't say I saw Piper take it , but I saw Davis pick it up , and I took particular Notice of the Frenchman ; he had a Livery Frock on , and the Watch had a String , and a flat Sort of a Chain to it . The Watch is in Court , but I ca n't take upon me to swear 't is the same , because one Watch may be very much like another . Poteira . This is the Watch I lost , and this Chain was hanging to it , and a blue String besides . Piper . Where was the Money spent ? Sutherland . I ca n't tell exactly . Piper . From whence did we set out ? Sutherland . From Westminster . I had dropp 'd them once , but I met with them again just by where the Gentlemen go down to take Water ; where there was the greatest Crowd of People , there we were . Piper said , when he came out , that he would not go on a pitiful Story , - for Handkerchiefs , - but for Watches ; he said , he would either get something , or nothing . John Briggs , Constable . I took this Watch from Mary Miller ; we heard of it by a Man who sells Rabbets in the Streets : He inform 'd the Chairwoman , that a Watch which had been pick 'd out of a Frenchman 's Pocket , had been sold to one Miller , who lives by Holywell-Mount ; so we got a Warrant to take up Miller , and we went to a publick House to see for him , but his Wife brought it to us , and said , she must have 45 s. for it , for he had paid 40 s. for it , and had spent a Crown upon the Persons he bought it of . I lent the Man a Guinea to make his Money up 45 s. that he might make her a Tender , and the Money was laid down upon the Table ; then Miller 's Wife ask 'd me , if I thought her such a foolish B - ch , as to take the Money before Witness ? So she beckon 'd the Frenchman out into the Yard , and he followed her ; when he came back , I ask 'd him , whether he had got the Watch ? he told me , no , and said , she insisted upon having the Money first ; upon this he charged me with her , and while we were waiting for Justice Chandler 's coming home , a Woman advised her to deliver the Watch , and take no Money . I have seen this Miller ( the Husband ) since this Accident ; I us 'd often to see him before , - he 's a Sort of Gambler , and sells Rabbets about the Streets . Both Guilty , Death . 92.

Mary Marsland . I am 13 Years old . I know the Nature of an Oath . About the 20th of September , I came out of a Service , in which I had been three Weeks , and having no where else to go , I came home . - He is my own Father ; and about Ten o'Clock at Night I went to Bed , and fell asleep ; he wak 'd me , & c. & c. I cry 'd out , and tho ' he put a Handkerchief to my Mouth , yet a Boy that lay in the next Room heard me ; [ the Girl gave a particular Account of the Fact , and mention 'd the Circumstances requisite to the Proof thereof , then she proceeded ] and he gave me the foul Disease . I got up about Seven o'Clock in the Morning , and did not tell what had happen 'd to any one , till about three Weeks afterwards ; I was taken sick about that Time , and could neither walk nor stand ; my Uncle carry 'd me to a Surgeon . I lay with him one Night ; for in the Morning , I went into Mansel-street , and after that I took a Lodging in the Minories , where I staid two or three Days , then I went to my Uncle 's , and was taken sick at his House . I have two Uncles , my Mother 's Brothers by Marriage , John Dewsberry , and John Waddiley . Prisoner . She has been prompted on to this by my Brothers-in-Law . I am as innocent as an Angel . I might turn in my Bed , and perhaps I might turn upon her , and hurt her ; I had no Handkerchief in Bed with me . Jury-man . I think she said , she grew so ill , she could neither go nor stand , and that in three Weeks it was found out ; and I think she has said , that she went to Mansel-street , and from thence to the Minories , and from thence to her Uncle 's ; what became of her Father all this Time ? The Girl . I was carry 'd by my Uncle to a Surgeon , and told him my Father did it . I ca n't tell when it was I told him , but 't was about three Weeks after . I told an Aunt of mine before I told the Surgeon , and that was about three Weeks after the Thing was done . My Uncle then seeek 'd out for my Father , but he kept out of the Way Thomas Ranshaw . ( Fifteen Years old . ) About 11 o'Clock one Thursday Night ( I do n't remember the particular Day of the Month ) I heard the Girl cry out , - do n't Father , pray let me alone , & c. & c. I was at that time in Bed in the next Room , which is separated from the Prisoner 's Room only by a little Partition . My Master keeps a Publick House in Petticoat-Lane , and the Prisoner lodged in the House . The next Morning , I told our Tom , the Hostler , of it , and nobody else , till it was found out ; then I told the Girl 's Uncle of it . The Girl 's Mother and Father , and she , used to lie together , but she ( the Mother ) is in the Hospital now . She never lay with him alone but that one Night , neither before , nor afterwards . The Girl . My Mother was in the Hospital then . John Waddiley . When the Matter was made known to me , I endeavoured to bring him to Justice , and therefore took out a Warrant for him , on the 12th of October . The Fact was committed on Thursday was three Weeks before , and the first Information I had of it , was on the 10th of October , from a Chairman , that married my Wife 's Sister . I thought it a henious Crime , and complained to Mr. Justice Rickets , who did not care to grant me a Warrant for the Prisoner till the Surgeon had made Affidavit of the Child 's Condition . And she was in a poor Condition indeed ; I asked her , if any one had meddled with her beside her Father ? She told me , No . She gave me an Account that she had lain with her Father and Mother-in-law several Times , at the Goat-Alehouse , in Petticoat-Lane , but that this Night her Mother-in-Law was absent , and she lay with only her Father . This Mother-in-law was in the Hospital for the Foul Disease , which was given her by the Prisoner , as he himself owned ; and she is now turned out , as incurable . When she was first seized with the Distemper , it affected her Brain , and she ran mad , and was put into Bedlam . ( The Witness here repeated the Account which the Child gave him of the Commission of the Fact ) When she told me all this , I went to the House where the Prisoner lodged , and was informed by the Boy that heard the Girl complain that Night , ( repeating the Words of her Complaint ) I did my Endeavour to get her cured , and got her under Doctor Ward 's Care , and I thought she had been well , but she is relapsed , and I have again apply 'd to him . Before I could take the Prisoner , I went to ( I believe ) thirty different Places where he had lodged , one Night , and two Nights , and at some three , and could not find him ; but at last he was taken on the very Day that Buchanan the Pyrate , was hanged ; and I told him , he had been to see a much honester Man than himself go to be hanged . He had absconded about two Months . Prisoner . I was every Day about my Business in Rosemary-lane ; and I was a Fortnight at Chatham . Charles Rag , Surgeon , gave an Account of the bad Condition the Child was in , and repeated the Account she gave him of the Commission of the Fact ; ( The particular Circumstances were too shocking to be exposed ; though unhappy Necessity call 'd for a Declaration of Truth in the solemn Proceedings of Justice . ) He added , That to save Expence , he had put her under the Famous Dr. Ward 's Care . Prisoner . If she has got the Foul Disease , I am innocent ; for I am a clean Man ; and if she is rotten with it , I am innocent as an Angel . Hannah Dewsberry . The Girl came to me , about a Week before Michaelmas , ill ; I asked her , what was the Matter with her ? She said , she could not tell . She grew worse and worse , and at last could not stir . I asked her if some nasty Person , had not meddled with her ? She said , No , - if it was so , it was her Father , - ( The Witness mentioned the Child 's Expression ) and no one had meddled with her but him . Mr. Rickets informed the Court , That the Girl 's Uncle came to him , and complained of the Prisoner 's having committed a Fact so horrible and unnatural , that he was cautious of taking the Evidence ; and thought , ( in such a strange Case ) it was proper to have some Account from a reputable Surgeon , before any Thing farther was done . That the Surgeon ( who had been examined in Court ) was a Man of Reputation , and he upon Oath declared in what a Condition the Girl was . That she giving him pertinent and rational Answers to his Questions , he examin 'd her likewise ; and she told him the whole Story , in the same Manner she had repeated it in Court , - but with more unnatural Circumstances , [ Which were mentioned ; particularly , That it was what all Fathers did , & c. ] Mr. Rickets added , That upon hearing all this , and the Evidence of the Boy , who heard the Girl 's Complaints , & c he granted a Warrant . John Theobald , the Constable , gave an Account of his having been , with others , three Days in a Week , in Search for the Prisoner ; and that tho ' they frequently heard of him , yet they could not take him . But at last they found him in a House where the People deny 'd him , and he had lock 'd himself up ; That the Prisoner deny 'd the Fact when he was taken , and said he only had - & c & c. Prisoner . When I was taken , I could have escaped if I had pleased , and as to my being locked up - I was not . And as to this Fact , I am as innocent as the Angels in Heaven , and if I die , I die innocent . William Sparks . I keep a Publick House in Petticoat lane : The Prisoner has used my House these two or three Years . I never saw any Thing unhandsome by him . Peter Field . I have known him some Years ; I never saw but he was a civil Man . I have a youngish Wife myself , and I never observed him to touch her . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 100.

See Sessions Book , No 1. p. 4 . Walker . I had been to see my Friends on the first Day of this Year , and as I was walking Home - down Bishopsgate-street , I met the Prisoner , and went into a House to drink with her . I staid but a very little while with her , and then , I said , - Well , Mary , we 'll be for going . No , stay a little , ( says she ) I expect a young Woman to call upon me , and then we 'll go together . By and by the other Woman came in , and I looked upon my Watch , and found 't was past 10 o'Clock , so I told them I must go home , and put up my Watch into my Coat Pocket . Says the Prisoner immediately , - you need not put your Watch into your Coat Pocket , here 's nobody will wrong you of it ; lend it me , and we 'll lay it down on the Table . A little after this , I took it up , and put it into my Pocket , and the Prisoner and I went down Bishopsgate-street , and the other Woman left us ( I am sure I had it when I came out of the Tavern Door with her . ) Well ; I went with her to her Lodging in Catherine-wheel Alley ; - the Stairs come down into an Entry , and just at the Bottom of the Stairs she got hold of my Watch , - I got hold of the Chain - the Chain broke , and she ran up Stairs with the Watch . I called for the Watch ( Watchmen ) and Constable ; the Constable came , and the Prisoner jumped out of a Window , one Story high , and fell down into a Cellar-window , and cut her Arm . Then she ran into the Catherine-wheel Alehouse : We followed her and took her ; and she was sent that Night to the Compter . Next Morning I went to her , and persuaded her to let me have my Watch again ; but I could not get it 'till she came to Guildhall ; then she sent for it , and it was delivered up to the Constable there , and he has got it , and the Chain too . I was pretty much in Liquor , but not so far gone , but I could remember all I have said ; I am sure the Prisoner is the Woman that took it from me . Prisoner . I never saw him till I saw him in the Alehouse ; and the Reason I jumped out of the Window was , because there was an Officer after me . Joshua Pearson , Constable . I was sent for by one of the Watchmen to assist him . When I came , the Prosecutor charged me with the Prisoner , for robbing him of his Watch . I was afraid of a Rescue , so I ordered her to the Watch-house , and seeing the Man in Liquor , I bid him consider how he charged the Woman ; but he gave me the same Account that he has now given , and was positive to the Woman . Then I asked him , if he could send to any one , who would speak to his Character , but no one coming , I sent them to the Compter together : The next Day I carry 'd them before Sir John Eyles , at Guildhall , and there he said the Woman took the Watch from him in the Street . I told him , I was surprized to hear him say so , when he had told me last Night it was taken from him in the House . Why , says he , 't is no Matter , - I have got the Watch . Ann Smith . On New Year 's Day at Night , about 8 or 9 o'Clock , she brought me home some Linen , ( no one at all was with her ) and she had not sat long in the Room , before she thought Bailiffs were coming to arrest her , and so , - she jumped out of the Window . William Gordon . I am no Relation to the Prisoner , - only a Namesake . I was at this Smith 's House , waiting for her Husband 's coming in , that we might drink together . About 8 or 9 the Prisoner went in with Linen , and staid , there an Hour or two , then somebody crying out Bayliffs ! She jumped out of the Window , and the Alehouse People stopp 'd her for breaking their Windows ; after this the Man came in , and charged her with stealing his Watch . I am a Butcher ; she washes my Linen sometimes , and I know no Harm of her . John Baine . I cry Fish in the Street , and never heard any Hurt of her . Acquitted . 112 , 113 , 114.

And also , One other Parchment Writing , purporting to be a Return made by the Commissioners , named in the above-said Commission , in which Parchment Writing it is set forth , that the said Commissioners had set out the Boundaries of the said Manors of Bradby and Hartshorn , and that the Waters of the Furnace Pond , should not exceed the Rails and Stoops , formerly set up , to divide the Waters from the Earl 's Grounds , & c. And that this Parchment Writing , purporting to be a Commission , was , at the Time of stealing the same , of the Value of 2 s. And which other Parchment Writing , purporting to be a Return to the said Commission , was at the Time of stealing the same , of the Value of 2 s. And were the Goods of our Sovereign Lord the King , against the Peace , & c. The Council for the King took Notice , That the Prisoner had been a Hackney Writer , employ 'd by some of the Sixty Clerks in the Six Clerks Office ; and the late Master of the Rolls having a Design that some of the Records for their better Preservation should be sent to the Tower , gave Orders to the several six Clerks to get them sorted , that such as were old , and proper , might be sent to the Tower : That this was done about June or July last , and required the Assistance of others beside the Clerks of the Office : That the Records of the Court of Chancery are kept in six Divisions , each belonging to one of the six Clerks , and that Mr. Collins in sorting those which were in his Division , had employ 'd one Hewit , who was acquainted with the Prisoner ; and that during the Time he was sorting the Records , the Prisoner often came into that Office , and into the Record-Room , and frequently made use of those Opportunities to take away a great Number of Records , Bills in Chancery , Answers , and Commissions issued out of Chancery to assign the Bounds of Manors , & c. That it might be wonder 'd , what Use the Prisoner could make of these Records , but the Wonder would cease , when it should appear , that he had two Uses for them . First , As all those Records made since the Commencement of the Stamp Act , have Stamps affix 'd to them , the Prisoner had Skill in taking them off , and putting them upon new Parchments , and then selling them as original Stamps , to the Detriment of the Crown , & c. That the next Use was , to dispose of the Parchments themselves , which he did to various Persons in various Employments : That in particular the Prisoner had sold a Quantity , after he had cut off the Stamps , to one Axtell , for a Shilling , among which the Commission and Return were found , for which he was indicted : That when the Officers of that Court , upon a Review of the Records , found many wanting , one Lulham , a Confederate with the Prisoner , made a Discovery before the Lord Chief Justice of the King 's Bench , of his having at various Times received many of these Records , sold the Stamps , and dispos 'd of the Parchment , to make Glew , Drum-Heads , and Taylors Measures , & c. & c. That Lulham , the Confederate , being dead , his Information before the Lord Chief Justice would be produced , & c. Mrs. - Sterling . Curtis Lulham was my Son ; he died the 13th of last November . This ( the Name at the Bottom of the Information ) is his Hand-writing . Mr. Uriah Shewdall . This is an Information sworn before the Lord Chief Justice Lee , by Curtis Lulham , in my Presence ; I believe I saw him write his Name to it . It was return 'd hither but Yesterday . The Counsel for the Defendant , objected to the reading of Lulham 's Information , and after the Point had been learnedly argu 'd on both Sides , Mr. Shewdall went on in his Evidence . Mr. Shewdall . When the Prisoner was brought before his Lordship , by my Lord 's Directions , I read over . I believe all the Parts of it in which he was charg 'd . I believe , in the Course of his Examination , the whole was read , first one Part , then another ; at one Time the whole was not read through , but during the Course of his Examination I believe the whole was read . Lulham was present when the Prisoner was examin 'd , and it was read to the Prisoner , that he might know what he was charg 'd with , and that he might give Answers in the Presence of Lulham , that my Lord might be the better able to judge of the Fact . The first Information of Lulham was on Oath ; then there was a Warrant against the Prisoner , and he was brought before my Lord , and I believe the whole Information was read over to him in Parts . Mr. Bennet . I was present all the Time the Prisoner was under Examination , and 'till he was committed . Mr. Shewdall , in the Presence of Lulham , read those Parts relating to the Prisoner ; and at another Examination , the whole of it seemed to me to be read in one continued Course , without any Interruption at all . In so much , that Mr. Cruwys thought it was not proper the whole should be discovered , because other Persons were concerned . Mr. Cruwys . I was present when the Prisoner was brought before the Lord Chief Justice ; at first some Parts were read , but afterwards it was read again , and I believe nothing was omitted ; The information was read , which set forth , That Curtis Lulham had been acquainted with the Prisoner about three Months , and that he had frequently seen in his Lodgings a great Number of engrossed Parchments , which the Prisoner confessed , and he believed , were Records of Chancery , and were taken out of the Six Clerks Office . That the Examinant had seen the Prisoner take off the Stamps , and the Cypher and the Lead , and fix the Stamps on other Parchments , with Gum ; and that once he saw a great Number of them , which he believed might amount to 150 , as near as he could guess , & c. And that one Lister acquainted this Informant , that in offering one Stamp to Sale , the Person detected the Fraud ; and that he had heard Matthew Hewit , late a Writer in the Office , say , he had sold a Stamp , and had paid the Prisoner 18 d. for the same ; six Pence whereof was afterwards spent , and that he was present at the Time of its being spent . And that the Informant had seen the Prisoner cut the Parchments long-ways , through the Middle , telling him he sold them to Taylors for Measures , and that he had sold 5 or 6 lb . to one that makes Cloaths to the Charter-house , for 8 d. That he had often seen the Prisoner pull out of his Waistcoat , several Parcels of these Parchments , which he had brought from the Six Clerks Office , and had often seen great Parcels of engrossed Parchment , hid under his Bed . that one time the Informant saw the Prisoner pack up a great Parcel , in a little Hand-basket , and deliver it to one Curwen to sell ; and Curwen told the Informant , he sold it . And this Informant asking Curwen , if it would not prejudice any one ? Curwen told him , - No ; for they were going to the Tower , and would not be wanted . That on the 9th of October , the Informant went to the Prisoner 's Lodging , and from thence they both went to the Record-Room where Hewit and Cave were sorting Records ; from thence they returned to the Prisoner 's Lodging and the Informant saw the Prisoner pull out several Parchments , ( which he believed to be Records ) and put them under his Bed . And at another time he went with the Prisoner to the Six Clerks Office , about the Close of the Evening , and saw him go to a Seat near the Window , ( a Seat under the Window ) and heard him ratling the Parchments . And that afterwards , when they came home , he said he saw several small Parchments , out of which the Prisoner told him he could scratch the Names , and then use them for Common Law Writs . Mr. Cart . I am an Agent in the Six Clerks Office ; I have known the Prisoner about two or three Years . Mr. Collins , one of the Six Clerks , employ 'd me to sort the Records , in the long Vacation ; He has a particular Part of them under his Care , and I was employ 'd to sort those which were in his Office . I began in August , and left off in September . I have observed the Prisoner to come several times , into the Office , to speak to Hewit , who was a Person employ 'd with me in sorting the Records . Sometimes he staid a longer , and sometimes a shorter Time ; he might sometimes stay half an Hour . I never observed him to meddle with any Thing , but I did not keep my Eye on him , because I did not suspect him . I believe he might be there about seven or eight times while we were thus employed . Sometimes he came alone ; sometimes Lulham came with him , and sometimes his ( the Prisoner 's ) Brother ; and sometimes one Conrade . He might very easily steal some of the Records , for there , was another Room , where Duplications , & c. lay , and through which he must pass to come to the inner Room . Mr. Bennet . Upon Lulham 's Information I took up the Prisoner ; I found him in his Lodging in Charterhouse-lane , and found several Parchments , cut and mangled , in a Drawer , upon which I set the initial Letters of my Name . - Axtel , a Dealer in Books in Moorfields , gave an Account , that about the latter End of August , or Beginning of September , the Prisoner came to his Stall , and asked him , if he would buy any Parchment ? That he went with him to his Lodgings in Charterhouse-lane , where the Prisoner shewed him four Bundles , ( without any Stamps ) which weighed 12 lb . and for which he paid him a Shilling , and the Beer they drank made the Price come to 17 d. That besides this , there were some Pieces in the Bottom of a Basket , which the Prisoner gave the Witness into the Bargain , and which were delivered afterwards to Lulham and one of Mr. Cruwys 's Clerks , at the Castle near Moorgate , but the large Pieces the Witness 's Wife sold at a Turner 's Shop , to make Drum-heads . The smaller Pieces , he intended to have sold to make Glew , had they not been called for . That these small Pieces he deliver 'd , were sealed up at the Castle , before they were carry 'd to Mr. Cruwys . And the Witness verily believed they were the same Pieces , which he had from the Prisoner . Mr. Henry Baxter deposed , That he was with Lulham when he went to enquire of Axtel for the Parchments . That Axtel informed them , his Wife had sold them , but that he had some little Bits at his Lodging , unsold , which he fetched ; and told them , he believed they were the same he bought of the Prisoner . That they were sealed up , with a Seal of the Man of the House , and that Axtel took the Impression of the same in his Pocket . And , that in his Opinion it was impossible for Lulham to slip any Parchments in among these Pieces unobserved . That these Pieces , so sealed up , were carry 'd to Mr. Cruwys 's , and after the Seals had been compared with the Impression , the Bundle was opened . Mr. Cruwys deposed , That after Axtel had satisfied himself that the Seals were right , he lock 'd up the Parcel , and it was never out of his Custody , till it was opened at the Six Clerks Office , where , the Pieces were put together , and Axtel signed them , the first time ( he thought ) they were open 'd . The Pieces were put together , and read ; they all appeared to be mark 'd by Axtel , except one Piece , and the Endorsement on the Back was , Dom . Chesterfield contra Cantrell , it was proved to be the Return to the Commission , and was signed by Hawkins and Brome , two of the Commissioners ; Mr. Baily swore he believed the Names to have been of their own Hand-writing . Mr. Baily , Mr. Bateman , and Mr. Cheek , prov 'd that such Proceedings had been in the Court of Chancery . A Person employ 'd in the Office by Mr. Collins , deposed , That he had search 'd among the Records for the Commission in the Case of the Earl of Chesterfield and Defendants , and it could not be found , nor the Return thereto ; that he found it mentioned in the List of those under Mr. Collins Custody , and , tho ' he had search 'd all the Rooms , he could not find it . DEFENCE . John Conrade . I knew Curtis Lulham about five Months ; he told me he was an Attorney ; but I found out that he was a Packer , or Cloth-Drawer . I was with him at the Six Clerks Office about the Beginning of last September ; he wanted to speak with Mr. Hewit , and went into the Record-Room , and took up a Bundle of Parchment ; then he cut the String they were ty 'd with , and was going to put them into his Pocket , but Hewit coming in , he threw them down again . He lodged with the Prisoner in the same Room , and I once saw him bring in a Bundle of Parchment in a Hand-basket , and he d-mn 'd my Eyes out , and bid me feel the Weight of them . I took them in my Hands , and judged there might be about 10 or 11 lb . of them . Then he open 'd them , and cut off some Slips ; some he threw into the Grate , and some he laid aside ; the rest he put into the Basket again , and that was put under the Bed . I did not observe whether there was any thing on the Slips he put by . Counc . Did you never receive any Stamps from the Prisoner ? Conrade . What I received from him , Lulham gave him to give me : He ow 'd me Money , and gave me three Stamps to sell . I was taken up on this Account , and was confined a Fortnight . Mary Crosby . Lulham lodged with the Prisoner in the same House . I never saw any Parchments there , but once , and that was a great while ago , and no body was then in the Room but he and my Daughter . The Night the Prisoner was sent to Newgate , he came up Stairs with a Candel in his Hand , and said he was sorry for what he had done , - he had wrong 'd the Prisoner , and was so vex 'd , he knew not what to do : I believe , ( says he ) it will break my Heart , and fell a-crying . Counc . Do you know of the selling any Parchment for the Prisoner ? Crosby . I never saw any but once . Counc . Did you never receive any from Sarah Dickenson ? Crosby , Yes ; my little Grand-daughter brought them to me , and desired me to carry them to Mr. Midgley , a Taylor ; he gave me 7 d. or 8 d. and I gave the Money to the Girl . Lambert Greenaway , John Dell , John Hartshorn , Christopher Coats , Edward Clark , and John King , spoke to the Prisoner 's Character , and said they never heard any Harm of him before . Some of them gave an Account of the Prisoner 's having been put to some Inconveniencies by disobliging his Father , who , notwithstanding that , allowed him something Weekly or Monthly , for his Support . - Sterling , ( Lulham 's Mother ) gave an Account of her having lost several Things out of her Room , and that she had seen her Knives , Forks , a Fishing-Rod , and several things she had lost , in the Prisoner 's Room . That about a Fort-night or three Weeks after Michelmas last , she went to his Room , to get her Son to write her three Bills , to stick upon three empty Houses , and saw the Prisoner taking off the Stamps from some Parchments ; that he ( the Prisoner ) asked her to dispose of some Parchments for him , telling her he had 30 or 40 lb . wt . to dispose of , at 2 d. or 3 d. a Pound .

Mary Wright . The Prisoner was my Servant . On the 6th of December I went to my Mantua-maker in the Evening , and left the Prisoner at home to take Care of the House , and clean out my Room : When I came back , I found the Street-door open ; so I call 'd Nanny ! Nanny ! bring a Candle ! but no body answering , I li't a Candle , and ran up Stairs , and found my Chest of Drawers broke open , and all the Things which are mentioned in the Indictment were taken out of the Drawers , and out of another Room . I saw no more of the Prisoner till the 28th of December ; then a Person that knew me , stopp 'd her in Drury-Lane , and sent for me ; we carried her before Mr. De Veil , and there she told me the Watch was stole away from her , by her Uncle , when she was in Liquor , and some of the Money she had spent at Rochester , the rest she had bought fine Cloaths with , which her Maid had run away with , and pawn 'd she knew not where ; she own 'd every Thing but the Sheets .

She lives up a little Court on the left Hand , in a Turning between the Cock Alehouse and the Crown Tavern on Ludgate-Hill . I shall see her ( ten to one else ) as I go home Tonight . Jonathan Keate . The Prosecutor keeps a notorious Bawdy-house , and is a Woman of a notorious Character . Wright .

That Woman ( Wright ) has offer 'd to pick me up ten or fifteen Times , as I have pass 'd from Fleet ditch to Salisbury Court ; she has offer 'd to go with me to a Tavern a great many Times .

Jane Rule had known Mr. Tidcomb half a Year , and was in the Shop when the Prisoner was serv 'd with Apples , and her Companion with Walnuts ; she saw them go out , and tho ' she had been at the Shop five or six Times a Day , never saw a Drop of Spirituous Liquors in her Life . Catherine Hunt , a Lodger in the House , gave much the same Account with Mrs. Armstrong . Margaret Harris ( for the Prisoner ) depos 'd , that the Prisoner ask 'd her that Evening to go in at Tidcomb 's with her for a Dram ; but as she knew the Prisoner to be one that laid Informations against People , she did not care to be seen ; so she stood at the Door , and saw the Prisoner and one Mrs Dyer serv 'd with two Glasses of some Liquor , which the Prisoner paid for : That this was about Eight or Nine o'Clock , and a Girl at the same time was sleeping , with her Head upon the Compter ; and when she came out , she went homeward with the Prisoner , toward Whitecross-street . Mary Tarry said she was with Harris at the same time ; that it wanted Quarter of an Hour of 9 o'Clock : She saw Mrs. Tidcomb fetch a Quart Bottle from the Back Room and pour out two Glasses , which were drank by Dyer and the Prisoner , and the Prisoner paid for them , while Harris and she stood at a little Distance from the Door . Hugh Williams swore he found a Bottle with Brandy , and another with Geneva in a Back-Room after Mrs. Tidcomb had deny 'd her having any in the House ; and that he found them upon the Prisoner 's ordering him to look in the Back-Room , and then Mrs. Tidcomb said , they were for her own Drinking . The Witness said he had been concerned in giving Informations himself . Robert Jackson , the Constable that served the Warrant , saw the former Witness take up one Bottle in the Back-Kitchen , and heard him say - here 's Gin or something , but he could not tell whether Williams tasted it or not ; or indeed whether there was any thing in it . Thomas Lloyd swore , Mrs. Tidcomb declar 'd ( when they went to take her ) that she had sold no Drams since the Commencement of the Act ; but that Williams upon the Prisoner 's Direction , went backward and took up a Quart Bottle with Liquor which he tasted ; that he afterwards took up a Pint Bottle and said , one was Brandy , and the other Gin ; and the Prosecutor said , they were for her own Drinking . This Witness stood all the Time at the Kitchen Door . Acquitted . She was a second Time indicted for a Conspiracy again the Prosecutor , and was acquitted . 141. John Hanna was indicted for wilful and and corrupt Perjury in his Evidence given ( at the last Sessions of Admiralty ) against John Longdon and John Grant . Mr. Samuel Farrant was called , who deposed , that the Prisoner on that Trial gave in Evidence as follows , viz . * That he was on board the Happy Entrance , whereof John Longdon was Master . That he was at the Helm , steering the Ship on the Holderness Coast , Jan. 5th about eight in the Evening , and seeing a Ship in the Way of his Steerage at Anchor , he asked Longdon , whether he might go to the Leeward . Longdon ordered him to go to the Windward . He said , if he went to the Windward , he should run her down , and Longdon replied he would knock him down if he did not go to the Windward , and that the People belonging to the Vessel , called out to them to keep clear . And that one John Wiley , the Mate ordered the Sails aback ; Longdon said he would knock them down if they put their Sails aback , for they might cut their Cable ; and they ran on Board her , and made a Hole in her Larboard Bow , by which in three Minutes she sunk . ( That ) the People on Board her , cry 'd out to save them ; Longdon told them , if there was a hundred they should all die . He said , there was a tall Man , with short black Hair attempted to save himself by climbing up the Side of Longdon 's vessel on the Gunnel , and he begged on Longdon , as he had run them down , yet ( that ) he would save their Lives , and told him that the Vessel belonged to Horselydown ; Longdon said no , if there was a hundred of them they should all die , and called to Grant to help him ; saying , That there should not one of them come on Board the Ship . Grant on that , took the Man by the Shoulders , and held him ; and Longdon took a Knife out of his Pocket , and ripped him up , on the right Side , and then they shoved him into the Sea , between the Bows of the Ships ; ( And that ) they saw no other Ship but that which they run down . * See the Trial , printed for J. Roberts in Warwick Lane . Mr. Farrant produced a Paper of Minutes , which he said , was a true Copy of the original Minutes , taken by him in Court upon Longdon 's Trial . But there appearing several Variations between Mr. Farrant 's Account of the Prisoner 's Evidence , and that assigned in the Indictment , the Prisoner was acquitted . The Councel moved for Leave to bring another Indictment against him next Sessions , which was granted . The Trials being ended , the Court proceeded to give Judgment as follows : Received Sentence of DEATH , 9.
