Last Christmas was Twelve Month , about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon , I went to see a Shop-Mate of mine , who liv 'd in Bishopsgate-street ; but is since dead . She and I us 'd to wind Silk together . And there I staid till one a Clock in the Morning ; not that I use to keep ill Hours ; for it is very well known that I take an honest Care for a Livelyhood , but it was Holiday Time , and we were willing to be a little Merry together . - So as I was a going along Windford-street , in my way home , there came 3 Men out of Mr. Jackson 's , the Black Lyon Ale-house , the Prisoner was one , and the Names of the two others , were Ward and Borce . They took hold of me , and one of them said , she 's a jolly Girl she shall be my Wife No , says another , She shall be mine . But indeed says the third , she shall be mine , - and so they drove me along as far as Spittle-fields-Market , and there they threw me down , and two of them held me while the Prisoner , - Laud bless me , - what shall I say now , - must I speak plain , - plain English ? - and before all these Gentlemen ? - I vow I am quite a-sham 'd , - I dont know how to speak such a Word , - but if I must , I must , - they held me while the Prisoner ravish 'd me : and I cry 'd and struggled , and did all that I could to hinder him , but it signified nothing , tho ' there came a Watchman with his Lanthorn , by which I saw the Prisoners Face , but he bid the Watchman go about his Business , and he 'd satisfy him another Time , and so the Watchman went away , and the other Two serv 'd me in the same Manner as the Prisoner did . They gave me the French Disease , and took away my Gown and Handkerchief . Margaret Dixon thus depos 'd . Upon Enquiry in Spittle fields-Market , I found the Prisoner and the two others . They own 'd they had lain with her . They beg 'd she 'd give them no Trouble , and swore from Time to Time , that they 'd come and make her amends , and give her 6 Shillings a piece to buy her a new Gown , but were never so good as their Promise . The Prisoner in his Defence , said that he was born and bred a Butcher in Spittle-fields-Market , and never absconded upon this Account . Mary Trotman thus depos 'd . The Prisoner is my Daughters Husband . I believe he 's as honest a Fellow as ever liv 'd , and I am sure he had no Occasion to ravish any Body , for my Daughter , tho ' I say it , is as likely a Woman as any in the Parish .

Samuel Warrener thus depos 'd . In Lincolz 's Inn Fields about 3 in the Afternoon ; the Prisoner and one John Cooms , pray 'd me to change half a Crown , which I laid I could not , they follow 'd me thro ' Russel street , into Charles-street , and there told me that they had been playly at Prick Belt , and that one of them had won 15 Pence of the other , and since they could not get the half Crown chang 'd , they 'd play who should have it all , if I 'd hold Stakes ; I agreed , it rain 'd very hard , so that I saw no Body out ourselves in the Street ; but as they were at play , a Boy came up to them , at which time the Prisoner and Cooms catch 'd hold of my Arms , and held me while the Boy pull 'd the Watch out of my Pocket and ran away , and then they let me go . Cooms made off , but I knockt the Prisoner down , he presently got up again , and run into the Bear Inn , in Drury-Lane , and there I took him . He desir 'd me to be easie , and he 'd procure me the Watch again ; upon which he sent a Porter to Turnbull-street . When the Porter return 'd , the Prisoner told me at first , that the Watch could not be had , but afterwards said , that if I 'd be favourable he 'd help me to it , and accordingly pull 'd it out of his Pocket . Guilty . Death . Benjamin Jones , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of John Beasly , and stealing a Silver Ladle , a Silver Cup , a Silver Taster , 4 Moidores , 8 Broad-pieces , and 29 l. 14 s. on the 28th of January , in the Night . The Witnesses thus depos 'd . The Prosecutor keeps a Distillers Shop , the Black Boy and Still , in Clare-Market ; his House was broke open in the Night , and besides the Plate and Money in the Indictment , a Parcel of Bills , and Notes of Hand , for upwards of 350 l. were taken away . Among these was a promissory Note from Mr. James Jones , to Mr. Jacob Tonson . The Prosecutor therefore sent Word to Mr. Jones of his House being broke open ; that if such a Note was brought to him , he might secure the Bearer . The Prisoner who lodg 'd in Little-Britain , was observ 'd to live very irregularly , and sometimes to appear in 2 or 3 different Suits in one Day , without having any visible Means of maintaining himself in such a Manner . Mr. Jones , who was the Prisoner 's Neighbour , took particular Notice of his coming home drunk , about 7 a Clock that Morning the Burglary was committed . And some other Circumstances concurring to raise a Suspicion of the Prisoner , he was apprehended . Some of the stoln Plate was found in his necessary House ; and a piece of an Iron Bar in his Chamber , the other broken part of which was left in the Prosecutor 's Cellar . The Prisoner was drinking in a Coffee-House near the Prosecutor 's , till Mid-night ; which was about two Hours before the Burglary ; for betwixt 2 and 3 a Clock that Morning , the Prosecutor 's Drawer was found in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields . The Prisoner thus made his Defence . I left the Coffee-House in Clare-street about 12 at Night , I was drunk , I crost the Way , and betwixt Mr.Cross 's Ware-House , and the Fishmongers ; I stumbled over something , and being just under a Lamp , I lookt about and saw lying there , the Plate that was found in my Vault , and the Piece of Iron that was found in my Chamber . From whence I went to Drury-Lane , and pickt up a Blackamoor Woman , and from her I went to the Night-House , and so home to my Wife in the Morning . Guilty . Death .

Samuel Millington , was indicted for the Murder of Richard Witchell , by striking , fracturing , and mortally bruising his left Leg , near the Ancle , on the 10th of February ; of which he languisht till the 24th of the same Month , and then dy 'd . He was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroners Inquest for Manslaughter . On the whole Evidence , the Fact appeared thus . The Deceas 'd was drinking in the Kitchen , in the Hoop and Griffin Tavern , in Thames-street . The Prisoner came into the same Room . The Deceas 'd asked him if he was not a Bricklayer , and if his Name was not Sam . Millington , to which the Prisoner answer 'd , Yes . Why then you are a Scrub , says the Deceas 'd - A Scrub ? For what ? - I 'll tell you for what . Do n't ye remember that about 12 Years ago , I fought with your Friend Bond , a Carpenter , at the Castle in Angel-street in St : Martin 's - Well and what then ? - And do n't ye remember that you parted us by taking me off . - Suppose I did ? - Why then , I say you are a Scrub , and a Scoundrel for your Pains , for if you had let us alone , I should have beat him . - You ' a ' beat him ! No , that 's a great Mistake of yours ! he would have beat you , and therefore instead of calling me Scrub , you ought to give me a Bottle . - A Mistake of mine ! Why I could have beat him or you either at that Time of Day , and I can still , for all I am grown so fat . I 'll fight you for a Guinea , and here it is . - You 're not in earnest sure ? - By G - d but I am . - I sha n't believe it , till I see you pull off your Hat and Wig . - Why then there 's my Hat , and there 's my Wig . Now cover the Guinea . The Prisoner taking off his own Hat and Wig , answer 'd no , if I fight it shall be for no more than a Bottle , tho ' I had rather give you a Bottle and let it alone . But since you will needs sight , there 's the first Blow , and in so saying , he in a jocular Manner gave the Deceas 'd a gentle Tap or Stroke upon the Cheek . D - ye for a Cowardly Dog . ( says the Deceas 'd ) do n't stroke me , but strike as hard as you can . I wont take the Law of ye . After this , as Mr. Burleigh made Oath the first Blow was given by the Deceas 'd , who struck the Prisoner on the Stomach , and tore his Shirt ; but most of the other Witnesses depos 'd that they did not see that , but did believe that the Prisoner struck first . However they both fell to fighting . The Deceas 'd endeavour 'd to strike the Prisoner , but the Prisoner knockt the Deceas 'd down three Times . He rose again , and before his third Rising , somebody pusht open the Door , and in shutting it again , his Heel was catch 'd betwixt the Door , and the Door-case , and he hastily endeavouring to get up , gave his Leg such a Wrench as dislocated his Ancle , upon which they sent for a Surgeon . Charles Whadcock the Surgeon thus depos 'd . Being sent for , to set the broken Leg of the Deceas 'd , I saw the Tibia ( or great Bone of his Leg ) forced quite thro ' the Skin , and hung over his Shoe . He being of a very ill Habit of Body , his Leg presently morrify 'd , upon which , after advising with other Surgeons , I cut it off . He fell into a Fever and dy 'd delirious . The Widow of the Deceas 'd depos 'd , that her Husband a little before his Death , said to her , Sam . Millington was the Cause of my Death , he has ow 'd me a Spite these Twelve Years , and now he has paid me . The Jury brought in their Verdict , Accidental Death . John Oneby , was indicted for the Murder of William Gower , Esq ; by maliciously giving him with a drawn Sword , in the left Part of his Belly , near the Navel , one mortal Wound of the Breadth of one Inch and an half , and the Depth of ten Inches . on the 2d of February , of which he languisht till the next Day . and then dy 'd . He was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroners Inquisition for the said Murder . Thomas Hawkins thus depos 'd . On the 2d of February about 10 at Night , Mr. Blunt , the Deceas 'd , the Prisoner , and my self went to the Castle-Tavern in Drury-lane ; where , in about half an Hour , Mr. Rich came to us . About the fourth or fifth Bottle , Box and Dice were call 'd for , and Dice laid on the Table , I dont know by whom . The Box and Bottle went round together , and tho ' we plaid so low , as not to set above half a Guinea , yet I had no great Inclination to it , and especially to set the Prisoner ; and therefore after a trifling Loss , I declined the Play . The Prisoner exprest a Disgust at it , but I told him I should follow my own Inclination , without regarding whether or no it was agreeable to his Humour . They continued playing : The Deceas 'd lost 30 Shillings . Mr. Rich said , Who will set me Three half Crowns ? Upon which the Deceas 'd took something out of his Pocket , and laid on the Table , but conceal 'd it with his Hand , and said , I 'll set you 3 Pieces ; and then taking his Hand away we saw 3 Half-pence . This was not offer 'd to the Prisoner , but he appear 'd to be much affronted . He said it was very impertinent to set 3 Half-pence , or Words to that Effect . The Deceas 'd ask 'd him what he meant by impertinent . You 're an impertinent Puppy , says the Prisoner ; to which the Deceas 'd reply 'd , The Man that calls me Puppy , is a Rascal or a Scoundrel , I ca n't tell which , He had hardly spoke , when the Prisoner snatch 'd up a Bottle , and with Violence threw it at his Head , which beat some Powder out of his Wig , but did him no hurt . He in return Tost a Glass ( or a Candlestick ) I ca n't tell which , for both fell down , at the Prisoner , but it did not reach him . They both rose up together , and went to their Swords ; which hung up in the Room . The Deceas 'd being quickest got his Sword first , and drew it , and stood still in a Posture of Defence , at a good Distance from the Prisoner , who was advancing , and drawing his Sword to meet him , but Mr. Rich stept in between , and prevented him , The Deceas 'd then threw away his Sword , and they all sat down again , and drank for about half an Hour : When the Deceas 'd offering his Hand to the Prisoner , said to this Effect . We have had hot Words . Major , you was the Aggressor : But let us be reconcil 'd . To which the Prisoner answer 'd to this Effect , No , D - n ye , I 'll have your Blood ; and turning to me he said , Hawkins , You was the Occasion of this . Why then , says I . If you have any Thing to say to me , I am your Man , and I 'll see you out . No , says he , I have another Chap first . In about half an Hour after this , which was near 3 in the Morning , the Company broke up . I went out first , and coming to the Street Door , I saw it rain ; I waited a little , and not seeing the rest of the Company come down , return 'd to the Room , and found the Deceas 'd wounded , and leaning on a Chair in a languishing Condition . He dy 'd the next Morning . I knew him intimately well , and dont believe that there was a sweeter Temper 'd Man in the World . John Rich thus depos 'd . I and some others , among whom were the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd , went together to see the New Tragedy of Hecuba . We sat together in the Pit , and the Deceas 'd and the Prisoner appear 'd to be good Friends all the Time of the Play , and when it was over , I left them for a little while , and met them again at the Castle . The Prisoner and I call 'd for Box and Dice , which not being to be had , the Prisoner call 'd for a Pepper Box , and it was brought . I saw Dice lying on the Table , but knew not how they came there . I laid down 3 half Crowns . The Major set me : I threw . Seven was the Main , and Six the Chance . The Deceas 'd put down 3 half Pence against me , and said , Here , I 'll set ye 3 Pieces ; I said I was not at the Brass . The Prisoner call 'd him an impertinent Puppy : Says the Deceas 'd , to this effect . I am not afraid of ye ; he that calls me Impertinent is a Rascal At these Words , the Prisoner threw a Bottle at him , which brusht his Wig as it past ; and he in return tost a Glass . Then they both took their Swords ; the Deceas 'd drew his , and stood ready to defend himself ; but made no Offer to push at the Prisoner . There was a Table and Chair betwixt them . The Prisoner was coming forward to engage with him ; but I stept between , and told him if he made a Longe it must be thro ' my Body ; which as I was unarm 'd would be Wilful Murder . The Deceas 'd then threw away his Sword , and they both sat down again ; the Deceas 'd put his Hand forward , and said to the Prisoner , Come , Major , let us be reconcil 'd : We have had Words in heat , but they ought to be forgiven and forgot . To which the Prisoner passionately answer 'd . to this effect G - D - ye you lie - I 'll have your Blood by G - a . When we all got up to go , the Prisoner hung his great Coat upon his Shoulders , and I think button 'd it in one or two places . Mr. Hawkins went out first . Mr. Blunt next , the Deceas 'd follow 'd him , I the Deceas 'd , and the Prisoner last , but he was hardly out of the Room , when he call 'd to the Deceas 'd . Hark ye , young Gentleman , I have something to say to ye . The Deceas 'd went back , they both re-enter 'd the Room ; the Door was immediately shut last ; I heard a Clashing of Swords , and a great stamp upon the Floor , as if made by the Prisoner , who is a very heavy Man . Mr. Blunt stept back , we endeavour 'd to get in , but could not immediately open the Door ; but at last by the Drawers Assistance , we got in . Mr. Blunt first and I close behind him . The Prisoner was then next to the Door , and standing with his Sword drawn in his Right Hand the Point of it toward the Deceas 'd , whom he held by the shoulder with his Left Hand . I think the Deceas 'd had then no Sword in his Hand , and I soon afterwards found it close to the Wall , behind the Foldings of the Table . It was greasy 4 or 5 Inches from the Point . The Deceas 'd clos 'd with the Prisoner , but in such a manner as if he rather fell towards him thro ' Weakness , than otherwise ; which makes me think the Wound was given him before we came in . We put him in a Chair , and sent for a Surgeon . I receiv 'd a little Prick with ( as I suppose ) the Major 's Sword , but I believe it was accidentally , while I endeavour 'd to part them . Mr. Blunt receiv 'd a dangerous Wound in the Belly , but I am ignorant by what Means . I told the Prisoner that I was afraid he had kill 'd the Deceas 'd . No . No , says he , I have only frighted him ; but suppose I had kill 'd him , I know what I do in such Affairs ; for if I had kill 'd him to Night ( while the Quarrel was fresh ) I should have had the Law on my Side . I asked the Deceas 'd on his Death Bed if he receiv 'd the Wound fairly , and he answer 'd faintly . I - think - I - did - but - I dont know - what might have happened - if you - had not - come in - The former Part of the preceeding Depositions , being confirm 'd by Michael Blunt , he thus went on . After the throwing of the Bottle , I being apprehensive that their Quarrel would break out again next Day ; I invited the Company to dine together , in hopes to bring them to a Reconciliation , and thereby prevent farther Mischief . The Prisoner answer 'd my Offer , with , No , G - d D - n ye all , I 'll dine with none of ye . I heard the Prisoner call back the Deceas 'd , and he was no sooner got into the Room again , but the Door was shut violently , and I heard the Clashing of Swords . When I got in , I did not see that the Deceas 'd had any Sword in his Hand ; he was sinking forwards , and I going to a assist him , receiv 'd a Wound in my Belly , which I was afraid was mortal , but I can not tell how , or by whom it was given : but I believe not by the Deceas 'd , who had no Sword in his Hand , not was in a Condition to wound me . Mr. Shaw the Surgeon thus depos 'd . I found the Deceas 'd languishing in a Chair , his Guts appear 'd on the Wound , and were mortifying by being expos 'd to the Air . I drest him and sent him home , but the next Day I found a second Rupture of his Intestines . He dyed soon after , and that Wound was the Cause of his Death . The Prisoner thus made his Defence . The Dice and Pepper Box were call 'd for , but not by me . I flung a Main and past it about . Mr. Hawkins refus 'd . I told him I thought there was as good Fellowship in a little play , as in altogether drinking : At last the Deceas 'd offer 'd to set 3 half Pence ; I told him it was very impertinent . He call 'd me Rascal . You impertinent Puppy , says I , what do ye mean by that ; and taking up a Flask I threw it towards him . He threw a Glass at any Hand , and immediately drew his Sword . I told him in so doing he acted very basely , and so I sat down again . When the Company was going , I put on my great Coat , which I think did not look as if I had any Thought of fighting . But the Deceas 'd and I being the two last in the Room , be no sooner saw the rest of the Company gone , but he slung the Door to , and drew upon me . I was oblig 'd to draw in my own Defence , and in parrying with him , I receiv 'd 3 Wounds , one on my Knee , another across my Finger , and a third on my Buttock ; which last I receiv 'd when I clos 'd him , for he then endeavour 'd to stab me in the Back , and it must be by him that Mr. Blunt receiv 'd his Wound , when he came to part us . The Drawer thus depos 'd . When I enter 'd the Room I saw the Deceas 'd and the Prisoner both with their Swords in their Hands , pointing towards each other , the Deceas 'd closed with the Prisoner , but so as if he was rather falling than pushing , the Prisoner had hold of the Deceas 'd with his Left Hand , for as soon as we parted them , the Deceas 'd was so weak that he could not stand . I did not see him stab the Prisoner behind . But I cry 'd out to the Prisoner , for God Sake what are ye doing . Mr. Burdet , a Surgeon thus depos 'd . The next Day in the Evening , the Prisoner sent for me to the House of Mrs. Gardiner , in Dean-street , near Red-Lyon-Square ; where he had conceal 'd himself . He desir 'd me to dress his Wounds , of which he had three , as he now says , but none of them were the Depth of a Quarter of an Inch . Mrs. Gardner depos 'd to the same Effect . Some Points of Law arising from the Evidence , the Jury gave in a Special Verdict : which is to be determin 'd by the Judges . William Gates , alias Vulcan , being attainted of Felony , by not surrendring himself within 40 Days after the Publication of an Order of Council requiring him so to do , he was brought to the Bar , and asked what he had to say why Judgment of Death should not be past upon him ; to which he answered , that he was not the same , Man , and that his Name was William Yates , and not Gates . He stood convicted of Felony , on a Clause in an Act of the 9th year of the King , commonly called The Black Act , which provides , That if Information is given upon Oath , before two Justices of the Peace , of any Person who has been guilty of any of the Offences mentioned in the said Act : And if that Information is certify 'd to the Secretary of State , and by him laid before the King in Council ; and thereupon an Order of Council is issued out , requiring the Prisoner to surrender himself within 40 Days after the Date thereof , and if on two Market Days , and in two Market Towns in the County , where the Offence is committed , the said Order is openly read , and then affixed in a publick Place in the said Markets , and likewise publish 'd in the London Gazette ; and if thereupon the Person so requir 'd to surrender , does not surrender himself within the limited Time , he shall stand convicted of Felony , the same as if he had been try 'd for the said Offences , and thereupon found Guilty .

THe Town being still imposed upon , and the publick ' daily comm 'd with tullome Praises of insaliable specificks Arcana 's , Boius ' , and many other Quack Medicines , it is thought necessary to can on the Unwary against them ; there being no Danger that the judicious Part of Mankind should be deceived by them . Why are these Medicines exposed to Sale at Toy-Shops , unless to sk on the Preparers of such notorious Cheats from the Resentment of injured People ? Are the best Physicians , or most eminent Surgeons , ashamed of their Prescriptions and Preparation ? Must the severe Affiliction of an Impostor 's Pocket induce Men to ruin their Constitutions ? Can we believe that Charity so others deplorable Circumstances will prevail on such a one to publish what he dare not own ? Are not the Degrees of the Veneral Disease various ? Are not Mens Constitutions vastly different ? Was there ever a Remedy always insailible ? Do not the same Things agree with one , and prove Poison to another ? Or are there not a sufficient Number of able and experienced Physicians and Surgeons , who practice in Publick , and whose Credit depend upon their Skill and Success ? The most ingenious Prescription may somet stail : And will any one depend upon he Apparatus , or an unknown Author , who never sees you , or consults your Distemper , and who , when he has sufficiently cheated you , will refer you to the Advice of some able surgeon ? Shall a Man 's Misery inclint him to be credulous , and prevail upon him to make himself more miserable ? Or can any one foolishly fear that a Surgeon will expose his Patient ? For your own Sakes , therefore apply to some Man of kill and Probity who appears to justify his Practice , and answer for its Success ; such a one invites you to his House , the first on the Right-hand in Crane-Court near Fetter Lane in Fleet-Street , a Golden Heart and Lamp at the Door ; who from the most nauseon . Degree of that unhappy Disease , will retrieve you to H al h and Vigour , speedily and securely , without Salivation . Enquire for the Surgeon , who may be advised with any Morning till Twelve a Clock , and from Three to Ten at Night . N.B , There being a young Surgeon in the Same Court ( to prevent Mistakes ) take Notice this is the first House on the Right Hand .
