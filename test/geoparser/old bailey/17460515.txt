Carter the Prisoner offer 'd them to Sale at our House . Court . Sarah Carlisle came to your House to let you know there were two Pieces of Cloth upon Sale ? Cart . Yes . Q . Did Sarah Carlisle desire you to go with her ? Cart . Yes , my Lord . Q . What then ? Cart . I consulted with this Gentleman first to stop these Pieces of Cloth , because I imagin 'd they were not honestly come by . I went to Mr. Corderoy , the Constable , to consult with him what I should do in the Case . Q . What then ? Cart . Then I went to Mrs. Carlisle 's House , and found both the Prisoners there . Carter said it was his Cloth . Q . When you came and found the Prisoners at the Bar , who shew 'd you the Cloth ? Cart . That Man that stands there in Blue-grey , Carter . Q . When he shew 'd you the Cloth , what then ? Cart . Then I said , I wish you would carry it down to the Water-side . I told him , when he carried it home he should have the Money for it . Cart . Then you did not ask him the Price , nor bid him any thing for it ? Cart . No . So he carried it down to the Waterside : I would have had him come over the Water , if I could ; but he pretended that the String of his Breeches was broke , and desir 'd this good Woman to bring him some Money directly . I wanted it to be carried to Mr. Corderoy 's , under a Pretence of having Money for it . Q . What did Carlisle say of these two Pieces ? These two Pieces were at Carlisle 's House ? Cart .

They both stopt me . Court ( to Prisoner Carter . ) You hear what this Witness says ; will you ask her any Question ? Carter . I do n't know any thing about it , but I carried the Goods down for this Man to the Waterside . Q . ( to Clement Corderoy . ) What do you know of this Matter ? Corderoy . My Lord , I deal in Sacking , and I am Constable too . My Lord , this Mrs. Cart and her Husband are Sack-Weavers ; they work for me in weaving of Cloth ; I have bought several Pieces of them at a Market Price , and have had some Suspicion that they were stolen . Q . What then , Sir ? Corderoy . That was before I had a Suspicion that they were stolen . I had four before I had a Suspicion , and I had a Suspicion of the fifth Piece . This was on Saturday the 3d of May . On Monday Morning there was two more brought , and I desir 'd them to bring the Persons to me . On the 6th of May they brought two Pieces with Mrs. Carlisle . I ask 'd Mrs. Carlisle who she had them of ; she said she they were the Property of a Person for whom she had the Disposal of them . I told her she must not take them away , but I must stop them and her too ; so I takes her to Guildhall , and was before some of the Sitting Aklermen , and by her Directions went to Fleetditch , where they said Carter liv 'd , but they said that Elizabeth Cart had decoy 'd them away . Q . Did Cart bring Carlisle 's Wife to you at the Time appointed ? Corderoy . Yes , my Lord . Carlisle 's Wife and Mrs. Cart came together . Carlisle 's Wife knew nothing of me ? it was done with an Intent by Mrs. Cart , to bring Carlisle to me . Q . Are you certain as to the Pieces ? Corderoy . I am positive to the Pieces , my Lord . Q . Do you know any Thing of Carter 's taking them , or how Carlisle came by them ? How came you to bring Carlisle here : If your Witness speaks true , even Cart says Carter was at Carlisle 's House , and Carter said the Goods were his ; they were Carter 's Goods in Carlisle 's House ; Now Carlisle may be a bad Man . Corderoy . They told me Carter us 'd to give him part of the Money . Q . ( to Carter the Prisoner ) You hear these Goods were found upon you . Carter . I was coming down Fleet-Street about Seven o'Clock in the Morning , he ( Carlisle ) ask 'd me to go home with him to eat a Bit of Victuals ; while we were sitting together , says Mrs. Cart and Carlisle , will you carry these Things down to the Water-side ? Q . Then you did not own them to be your Goods . You hear what Cart says ; that you own 'd that they were your Goods . Q .

Said the Deceas 'd , if they are not worth Half a Crown , I have Half a Crown in my Pocket , for which I will fight you : With that , when Roberts came out again , he ran at the Deceas 'd , and they collar 'd one another , and scuffled 'till they had got just at the Threshold of Roberts 's Door : I saw Roberts make an Offer of striking , but did not see any Weapon , or any Blow struck .

Was you there when he came into the room again ? Burroughs . All the Time , my Lord . Court . When the Deceas 'd got up to go out of his Company the Prisoner then stopp 'd him . Burroughs . Yes . Q . Was the Deceas 'd upon his Legs ? Burroughs . He mov 'd , and came towards the End of the Table ; then the Prisoner ripp 'd him up . Q . What did the Deceas 'd say ? Burroughs . He said he must quit his Company , or he should get out of his . Q . Now when the Deceas 'd said that , and was moving along , what did he say ? Burroughs . I did not hear him say one Word . Court . You describ 'd the young Man as leaning back , and crying , Oh ! Oh ! Burroughs . I did not think he was stabb 'd : They came out when he was hitting of him , and had , as it were , all the Room to themselves . Q . Now before the Prisoner went out the first Time , what past about the Prisoner 's leaving the Company . Burroughs . The Prisoner was persuaded to leave the Deceas'd 's Company ; then afterwards he came again . Q . When the Deceas 'd fell down , was it any Distance ? Burroughs . The Prisoner follow 'd him two or three Steps , and stabb 'd him in the Breast . Q . What did you do then ? Burroughs . Immediately seiz 'd him , as soon as he had struck him . I twisted his Arms when I laid hold of him ; and he said , Let me go , or I will stab some of you . Q . When the Deceas 'd came to go out at the End of the Table , as you have been describing , Did he strike the Prisoner , or was he in a Temper of Striking ? Burroughs . My Lord , he spoke with all the Mildness in the World ; said , he would not stay in his Company if he continued wrangling . Q . Did he strike the Prisoner ? Burroughs . No , my Lord . Q . Did he justle or push him , or any thing to provoke him ? Then he was not come up to him to strike ; which would be very material . Did the Prisoner do any thing to hinder the Deceas'd 's geting out . Burroughs . I never saw any thing but the Stabs upon the Breast . Q . Do you know any thing else relating to Circumstances ? Had you any Discourse with the Deceas 'd after he was wounded . Burroughs . When they had secur 'd the Prisoner I ran out to see for a Surgeon ; when I came back there was two there before me . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Would you ask any Questions of this Witness ? Prisoner . No , my Lord ; but he has said Things that are not true . Q . What has he said that is not true . Prisoner . I ca n't remember what he has said . Q . ( to Burroughs ) Did you know both these ? Burroughs . I never saw the young Man that is dead , nor the Prisoner , before . Court . You say he struck him four or five Times ; Did you see the Wound ? Did he strip off his Cloaths ? Did you see the Wound ? Burroughs . My Lord , I saw his Bowels ; I saw the Shirt that was bloody ; he pull 'd it up , and his Bowels came all out . Q . When you took this Penknife out of his Pocket , did it appear to be bloody ? Burroughs . My Lord , I did not take it out of his Pocket . Q . ( to William Merrit ) Was you in this Company ? Merrit . I was in the Company from the Time it began , to the Time of the unhappy Accident . Q . Was you acquainted with this young Man ? You was all of a Club , was you ? Court . Tell us what past previous to this Misfortune . Merrit . The young Men , the Society , newly came from another House ; they are Neighbours , and such like , together ; and the Landlord offer 'd to give us an Entertainment . We came to Supper after we had left Work . A little while after we had been there , the Prisoner at the Bar came along with another Man up Stairs ; they were ask 'd to sit down before Supper , which accordingly they did . By and by the Deceas 'd came into the House , and enquir 'd for Mr. Church ; but a young Man said he would bear him Company 'till he came , he believ 'd it would not be long . After Supper was over the Prisoner went down to the Deceas 'd , and came up again ; and some Time after the Deceas 'd sent up , If any of them had any thing to say to him , they might come down . Court . Then the Deceas 'd was not in the Room ? Merrit . No ; the Deceas 'd had some Steaks dress 'd for himself in another Room . When the Prisoner went down most of us went down with him . Q . How came you to have any Curiosity to hear ? Merrit . Because they were accusing one another with Sodomitical Practices . The Prisoner told the Company the Deceas 'd was one concern 'd in Sodomitical Practices . All of us came down , and stood round the Table . Several Words and Squabbles past between them . The Deceas 'd said , Bear Witness what the Man says to me . Please you , my Lord , after several Words had past we went up again ; I ca n't say there was any thing more 'till the unhappy Accident . When we had paid the Reckoning the Prisoner said , Are your Company gone ? the Landlord said , some are below and some above . Then said the Prisoner , I 'll go and have a Look at them . Now his Friend , one Shaw , desir 'd that he would not go ; but he insisted upon going in to look at the Deceas 'd . Some of the Company desir 'd him not to set before the Gentleman , because it would be an Affront to him ; so he sat down at the End of the Table ; and a great many Things past upon the Subject . At last he turn 'd about and said , he would withdraw out of his Company , or else the Prisoner should go away . Court . Then you had paid your Reckoning above Stairs ? Merrit . Yes . Q . After the first Wrangling who did you leave in the Room with the Deceas 'd . Merrit . There were , I believe , two or three ; the Prisoner said he would go and have one Look more at him ; and his Friend told him he was afraid . Mischief would come of it : He said these Words , or to that Effect . Q . You all went into the Room ; pray tell what pass 'd then ? Merrit . He sat down at the End of the Table ; some of the Company desir 'd him to get off , telling him he should not sit before the Gentleman , meaning the Deceas 'd , but he continued sitting at one End of the Table and the Deceas 'd at the other , when the latter desir 'd him to withdraw . Q . Did the Prisoner urge the Quarrel again ? Merrit . Sometimes Words ran high , and sometimes abated ; then the Deceas 'd desir 'd him to withdraw , or he would go into a private Room and talk with any of us ; but as for that Man , meaning the Prisoner , he would have nothing to say to him ; so some of the Company made an Opening for him , and as he was coming out the Prisoner met him ; he lifted up one Hand and with the other made several Motions at his Belly ; I did not see the Gentleman make any Return , but cry 'd out , Oh ! Oh ! then he said I am ripp 'd ; I did not hear him say he was ripp 'd up , but I am ripp 'd ; with that he fell backward , and the Prisoner stepp 'd forward and gave him some more Pushes ; I saw his Powels come out , and there were two or three Wounds upon his Breast . Q . Did you take the Knife from him ? Merrit . No , my Lord ; but the Gentlemen who were by took the Knife out of his Pocket : When the Deceas 'd open 'd his Cloaths a considerable Quantity of his Blood and Bowels flew about . Q. I would ask you the same Question as I did the other Witness : Did the Deceas 'd , when he was going out , or towards the Prisoner , come in a Way of fighting , threatning or striking , or did he make any Motion at the Prisoner ? You used an Expression just now , I would have you explain it ; you said the Prisoner met him , as he rose up he turn 'd the Corner of the Table . Merrit . Yes . Court . Then if he turn 'd the Corner of the Table that Way , he was in the Way of the Prisoner 's coming out . How far might it be that this poor Man , who is dead , fell back , when the other stabb 'd him again ? Merrit . His Body fell back , I believe , near four Feet . Court . You said there were two Men that sat at the other End of the Table . Merrit . Yes they did , my Lord . Q . Have you any thing more to say ? Merrit . No , my Lord ? Q . ( to John Church . ) Was you in this Company ? Church . Yes , please you my Lord , I supp 'd there . Q . Was you of the Company above Stairs . Church . Yes , my Lord . Court . Pray give us an Account of this unhappy Affair . Was you by when this Man was wounded ? Church . When he Deceas 'd came in first he sent for me to drink with him ; please you , my Lord , the Prisoner at the Bar came down after I had been there a little while , and said , How do you do , Mr . Girl ? The Deceas 'd said , let me alone , let me eat my Supper in quiet . Court . Then the Prisoner came down almost as soon as you . Church . Yes , my Lord . Q . When he ask 'd this Girl how he did , what was the Manner of it ? Church . I could not know the Heart , but I thought it was in a scornful Sort of a Manner . Please you , my Lord , the second Time he came down he began to asperse him very much ; they accused one another , and neither of them made any Defence . The Deceas 'd desir 'd me to go up Stairs and enquire whether any of the Gentlemen had any thing to say to him , if they had he would answer them ; with that the Prisoner came down , and another or two with him , when a pretty deal pass 'd between both : The third Time when he came down he sat himself upon the Table ; after some Words the Deceas 'd got up to go out of the Room , whereupon the Prisoner said he would make way for him to go by ; but as he was coming out of the Box the Prisoner met him and gave him the Rip : He cry 'd out Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! and the Prisoner gave him two or three more Stabs . Q . Was the Deceas 'd in a Posture of attacking or striking the Prisoner at that Time , or was he going out in a quiet Manner ? Church . Please you , my Lord , I saw no Offer of any Blows at all ; I did not see him lift his Hand up . Q . Did you see the Wound ? Church . I saw it ; but it was in such a Condition I could not bear the Sight ; I believe the Cut was six Inches long , and the Bowels that came out were as many as I could put into my Hat . Q . How long did he live ? Church . I believe my Lord he liv 'd about five or six and twenty Hours . I can not tell . Q . Who was the Person that took the Knife away ? Church . One Abraham Mood , my Lord . Q . The Prisoner says you was sent for him . In what Manner was you sent to call the Prisoner down ? Church . The Deceas 'd desir 'd me to go up and to say , that if any Man had any Thing to say against him , he desir 'd to hear it . Court . But if I understand you , the coming down of the Prisoner and the rest , was not the Time when the Mischief happen 'd , for they all went away . Church . Yes . Court . Now tell me how they came into the Room the third Time . Church . Please you my Lord , I can not tell what Reason the Prisoner had to come into the room the third Time . Q . ( to - Mode . Tell us what you know of this Matter . Mode . We had Supper brought about Eight o'Clock , at the Ship and Anchor . The Prisoner at the Bar came up , and Mr. Shaw along with him : When Supper was brought to Table , I was in Company with the Deceas 'd ; he had not eat any Thing all Day , and he had some Mutton Chops , and he had them broil 'd . Q . Was you there when the Prisoner was in Company ? Mode . Yes . The Gentleman had his Supper , and the Prisoner came in and said , how do you do Mr . Girl , alias Jones ; the Deceas 'd said I have nothing to say to you , let me eat-my Supper in Quiet ; with that the Prisoner went up Stairs . Afterwards the Deceas 'd sent up to know if any Body had any Thing to say to him , if they had they might come down ; then the Prisoner went down and two or three more with him ; with that they were sending and proving for some Time : When we had paid our Reckoning , I saw the Prisoner at the Bar come and sit down at the End of the Table , and they brought a Stool for him ; and the Deceas 'd said , Gentlemen , I should be glad of all your Companies , except that Man . With that he was a coming out , the Prisoner met him and ripp 'd up his Belley , and he fell backward a little , and cry 'd Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! With that the Prisoner follow 'd him and gave him three or four Stabbs . I took the Knife out of his Pocket , bloody . Some run for the Surgeon , and others to the Watch-House for the Officers . Q . What Wounds did you see ? Mode . I saw the Wound in his Belly , six Inches and a half long , and three Wounds in his Breast . Court . And it let his Bowels out . Mode . Yes , It let his Bowels out . Q . ( to William Buttle ) What do you know of this Matter ? Buttle . My Lord , we had a Supper at this House ; I was there along with the rest of the Company ; the Prisoner at the Bar and Mr. Shaw came in , and were ask 'd to sit down at Supper ; they fell into Discourse about what the Deceas 'd said : A Person came up to ask for one Mr. Church ; the Answer was , that he was not there ; but I was told somebody was gone for him , and he came up , and the Company desir 'd if the Prisoner at the Bar could clear himself he would go down , for they were uneasy at having such a Companion ; some of us went down with him , when they accused one another Face to Face ; tho ' neither of them said they were not guilty , but only cast Reflections upon one another . Q . Where was you when the Prisoner and the Deceased were together the third Time ? Buttle . Please you my Lord , I did not go into the Room with the Prisoner at the Bar the last Time ; as we heard Words rise very high , we arose from the Table and went into the Room ; when I came into the Room I found the Prisoner sitting upon the Table ; in two or three Minutes I saw him sitting upon the stool or Chair ; after that I saw the Deceased rise up , and he told the Company they should let him go by , he would not stay with the Prisoner : The Prisoner at the Bar turn 'd at the Corner of the Table ; I saw him push against the Deceased 's Belly , and the Deceased sell back in a sort of a Laughter , ah , ah , ah . I thought it was some Action of their old Way of Discourse ; presently the Deceased cry 'd my Bowels are out . Q . Did you see any Knife in the Prisoner 's Hand ? Buttle . No . Q . Did you see the Wounds afterwards ? Buttle . Yes , please you my Lord . Q . ( to John Duncan ) What do you say to this Matter ? Duncan . I was in Company , my Lord , at the same Time when Mr. Shaw and Mr. Prigg came . The Deceas 'd had accus 'd the Prisoner at the Bar : Mr. Shaw said that Girl did not dare to face them . Girl came afterwards into the House , and sat down in a back Room below Stairs . When we heard that Girl was come , some of the Company said to Prigg , that he had as good go down and clear himself ; so he went down and several others ; so Prigg said to Girl , your humble Servant Mr . Girl , and he look 'd at the Prisoner at the Bar , and said , who does he speak to . The Deceased farther said , mind , Gentlemen , what he says of me ; with that we all went up Stairs again , and when the Deceased had supp 'd , he sent up one Church to tell us , that if any of the Company had any Thing to say to him he would answer them ; Prigg immediately said , he should be glad if some of us would go down with him , to hear what he had to say ; accordingly we did so , and many Words passed between them ; then we went up again to pay our Reckoning ; and coming down Stairs Mr. Shaw and the Prisoner went into the other Room to the Deceased ; I went in also , and lean 'd over the Box to hear their Discourse ; The Prisoner at the Bar sat on the End of the Table , and one of the Company said , get Mr. Prigg off the Table , for it will affront the Gentlemen to sit before them ; whereupon a Stool was brought him , and he leaned with his Right Hand on the Table , and they talk 'd pretty deal . The Deceased said , Gentlemen , bear Witness , I have nothing to do with this Man ; and desir 'd he would get out of his Company : The Prisoner said , he would sit there , as it was a publick House . The Deceased said he was glad to see his Friends about him , but he did not like that Man . The Prisoner said , if you do not like my Company make a chalk , or lay your Cane across the Table ; but that did not satisfy the Deceased , he got up and would go into another Room to see if the Prisoner would follow him . John Tillen sat next the Deceased , one Thomas Parks sat at the outside , and Prigg sat with his Hand in his Pocket ; as the Deceased was coming out , Prigg jump 'd up and gave him a Push and he fell backwards , crying Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! He gave him a Wound six Inches . I went to him , he pull 'd up his Shirt , and my Hat would not hold the Quantity of Bowels that came out of the Wound ; with that some went for the Watch , and others for the Surgeon . John Nicolas Jecquin . I was call 'd about Two o'Clock on Tuesday Morning to come to one that was wounded at the Ship and Anchor ; when I came Thomas Girl lay on the Bench with one of his Legs on the Table , when I look 'd on him and found two Wounds on his Right Breast , neither of which had penetrated into the Cavity ; and , finding his Bowels very cold , I got some warm Water and Brandy , for laying so long they were grown stiff and hard ; I reduced them into their Place and sew 'd up the Wound . Q . You did not see the Intestines wounded ? Jscquin . No , the Man was very well at Ten o'clock ; that is , found in his Judgment , he was not delirious , but in an Inflammation , a Fever , [ the Surgeon was a Foreigner , so did not speak quite intelligible in every Thing , ] Q . Do you apprehend this to be the Cause of his Death ? Jecquin . Only I would observe the Man was a long While before he had been dressed . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) Now is your Time to make your Defence . What have you to say for yourself ? Prisoner . I have nothing to say , I commit my Cause to God . George Williams . About a Fortnight before this Fact was committed , the Prisoner came to my House and ask 'd for Mr . Girl , we told him he was not at home ; he asked where he was , he said he would search Ormond-Street for him , and wherever he met him he would rip him up and let his fat Guts out . Q . What Condition was he in ? Williams . He seem 'd very sober . Council . I think this was an Instance of his Madness , to make such a Declaration . Q . ( to Thomas Coates ) what are you Mr. Coates ? Coates . A Plisterer , my Lord . Q . Where do you live ? Coates . In Little-Kirby-Street , by Hatton-Garden . My Lord the Prisoner serv 'd his Time with me , and work 'd with me afterwards for a Twelve-month ; but the . Year before he was out of hi Time I was oblig 'd to carry him to the Cold-Bath . for an Illness in his Head , and they told me if I did not dip his Head all over he would run mad . Q . How long was that ago ? Coates . I believe about three Years and Half ago . Q . When did he work ? Coates . I believe he has not been able to work for some Time : I have seen him lately , and sometimes he has talk 'd wildly , and I have taken him to Task as he has been rambling backwards and forwards ; he always seem 'd a good sort of a Man , and a sensible Man before this Illness seized his Head : I saw him about three Weeks ago , he said he believ 'd he should drown himself . I gave him some good Advice , and , then indeed , he seem 'd to answer me very well in that Respect . Q . ( to Elias Hare ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Hare . I have known him between six and seven Years . Q . What are you ? Hare . I am a Weaver , by Trade . Q . Where do you live ? Hare . Next Door to the Prisoner , in Bell-Lane , Spital-Fields . Q . Have you been frequently in his Company within this Half Year ? Hare . I was with him the last Sabbath-Day at Night before this Affair happen 'd , he drank to me , and said your Health ; said he I believe I shall never drink with you again as long as you live ; I said , Sam , you are beside yourself : And he talk 'd very out of the Way Things of making away with himself , & c. Q . Now I would ask you , whether in that Conversation you had with him he did not understand the common Affairs of Life ? How long were you together that Night ? Hare . From Six o'Clock to Ten . Q . Did you talk of News , & c. Hare . None at all : We went to Hackney after the Evening Service , and he seem 'd to be very melancholy . Q. Pray tell me whether he did not talk of the Weather , the Fields , and the Pleasures of the Country ? Hare . He talk 'd very rambling ; I took him not to be as he should be . Q . Who was it going to Hackney , you or him ? Hare . My Lord , his Wife was with him . Q . Were you going to any Friend of theirs ? Hare . We took a Walk after Sermon for Recreation . Q . Had you ever heard before of any thing that had happen 'd to this Man ? Hare . I know he has not follow 'd his Business as he should have done this Year or two ; sometimes he would keep his Bed for two or three Days in a melancholy Way , and assign no Reason for so doing . Q . What do you mean that he did not keep the Business of a Pawnbroker as he should have done ? Hare . Sometimes he would take it in his Head to lie in Bed for half a Day together , then he would come down and go up again . Q . Who keeps the Books ? Hare . His Wife and his Maid . Q . Have you not seen him about in his Business , though not so diligent as he should be ? Hare . No , my Lord , I have not seen him of late about his Business . Q . Do you remember that he complain 'd of being over-rared , and went to complain about it ? Hare . Yes ; but I believe it is near a Twelve-Month ago . Q . ( to Mary Ray . ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Ray . Sir , I have liv 'd above twelve Months in the Family . Court . Pray now give an Account of him ; how has he been since you came into the Family ? Ray . Sir , at some Times I have observ 'd him to be very melancholy ; and one Time he drew a Knife out of his Pocket to stab himself while he was at Dinner . Q . Had he the knife at his Breast ? Ray . Yes . His Wife said , what are you mad ? with that she took the Knife from him . When he took the Penknife out of his Pocket he said he would run it through him . Q . What did you apprehend to be the Matter ? Ray . I look 'd upon him to be in a melancholy Way . Q . Did you look upon him to be at that Time in his Senses , to understand what he was about , or this to be owing to a sudden Start of Passion ? Ray . I took him to be in a melancholy Way ; but no body said any thing to him then ; there was only my Mistress and I and my Master at Dinner ; at the same Time no body had said any thing to him , for he had not been out of the House all Day . Q. I would ask you , young Woman , what Trade or Business your Master carry 'd on ? Ray . My Master is a Plaisterer and Pawnbroker ; but my Mistress and I carry on the Business . Q . Who keeps the Books ? Ray . My Mistress , not my Master . Q . Who keeps the Accounts of the Family , and receiv 'd and paid Money ? Ray . Some times I took out Money . Q . In general who paid the Butcher , Baker , and the People that you dealt with ? Ray . I sometimes paid them and sometimes my Mistress ; What my Master might pay out of Doors I ca n't say , but he seldom paid within . Q . But I ask you , whether you ever took him , at ordinary Times , to be one that did not understand what he was doing ? Ray . Yes , when he has come down Stairs and wanted to go out in the Night time . Q . When was that ? Ray . About three Months ago ; and I have very often seen him sit and cry to himself . Q . What Servants had he in his Way of Business as a Plaisterer ? Ray . Sir , I never saw any that he had . Q . Then I ask you , upon your Oath , whether he was not at work as a Plaisterer within three Days before this Misfortune happen 'd ? Ray . Yes , I believe he did go out the same Day . Q . Did he come home from Work at Night ? Ray . Yes , Sir , I believe he did . Q . Did he not dress himself to go abroad , after he came from work in the Evening ? Ray . Yes . Q . Did you not hear your Master and Mistress both complain that they were too high rated in the Parish ? Ray . No , my Lord ? Q . Do you know any thing of his appealing to the Parish on account of being high rated . Ray . I know a Gentleman came to our House . Q . When was it ? Ray . I ca n't say the Day ; I believe it was about Christmas . Q . Has he any Family ? Ray . No , my Lord , none but a Wife . Q . ( to Abraham Shaw . ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Shaw . Six or seven Years . Q . Have you been well acquainted with him latterly ? Do you live near him ? Shaw . I do n't now ; but I have liv 'd in the House with him . Q . How long since ? Shaw . It is about three Years ago . Q . During the Time you liv 'd with him was he then different in his Behaviour from other Men ? Have you since discover 'd any Thing ? Shaw . About three or four Months ago he came to my House , between Seven and Eight o'Clock ; he came up very quick : I ask 'd him why he came so very soon ? he did not speak . I said there is something the matter that you get up so very soon ; with that he look 'd at the Glass , and fell a crying . He ran down , and I follow 'd as far as Hackney ; when I overtook him he fell a crying sadly . I insisted to know what was the matter . Q . Did you apprehend he was in his Senses ? Shaw . My Lord , he has been disorder 'd in his Senses near a Twelvemonth : I know he has been several Times going to make a-hand of himself , to drown himself , & c. Q . How can you tell he was going to drown himself when you follow 'd him to Hackney ? Shaw . He was running near Hackney-Marsh , and I know that he was about to make a-hand of himself . At some Times he would talk of strange Things , that we could not understand . Q. I Would ask you , Have you look 'd upon him , these two or three Months last , to be in his Senses , or out of his Senses ? Shaw . Out of his Senses . Q . How often may you have been in his Company within this Month ? Shaw . Seven or eight Times . Q . Did he behave like a Madman ? Shaw . He us 'd to have very slighty Airs . Q . Had he any Money in his Pocket when you went to the Alehouse ? Shaw . Yes . Q . Did he ever mistake in his Reckoning ? Shaw . I believe not . Q . Let me ask you another Thing ; I believe you was in Company that Night . Shaw . Yes , I was , my Lord . Q . How came you there ? Shaw . We were both invited to Supper at that House . Q . Where do you live ? Shaw . I live in the Hamlet of Bethnal-Green . Q . Where does he live ? Shaw . He lives in Spittalfields . Q. I would ask you , whether , when you call 'd him , you did not see him dress 'd . Shaw . When I spoke to him , he said he was going to that House , and I told him I was going there too . Court . Then he knew that very well . Q . When you came into the House , did you go into the Company . Shaw . Yes , my Lord , we supp 'd there , and there was a Noise ; they said there was a Man come into the House that had something to say to the Prisoner at the Bar ; when he came he spoke something to him . As to Particulars , there was such a Noise , that I can not relate . Q . Let me ask you whether the Prisoner did not maintain his Dispute with as much Understanding as any of the Company ? Shaw . I ca n't give any Particulars of that . Q . Did you not hear him and the young Man that is dead reproach one another ? Now the other Witnesses , several of them , have said that the rest of the Company were listening , and attentive to hear what they charg 'd one another with . Can the Prisoner write ? Shaw . I believe he can . Q . Does he write any Letters ? Shaw . Yes ; I know he has wrote one Letter , the Letter he sent to the deceas 'd Gentleman . Q . Did you read that Letter ? Shaw . No , my Lord . Q . Who carried that Letter ? Shaw . I carried it to a Tavern . Q . ( to Mary Fox ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? What have you to say ? How long have you known him ? Fox . I have known him from a Child ; and for these latter six Years I have been very intimate with him . Q. I would ask you how he has been for these three or four Months past ? Fox . He has had his Intervals at Times ; I have seen him very well at other Times . When his Disorder comes upon him he hares about ; by the Help of a Gentleman that has come into my Apartment , we have confin 'd him for six or seven Hours together . Q . Did you take any Observation of him within this Fortnight . Fox . No . Q . Have you seen him within this Month ? Fox . Yes ; he came to me exceedingly confus 'd : I said , What is the Matter , Mr. Prigg ? he said , Do n't ask me , Good by to you , good by to you . Q . What do you look upon to be the Matter with him ? Fox . I have seen him all of a sudden break a fine Piece of China ; then he has gone up Stairs and thrown himself upon the Bed . Q . ( to Anne Good ) Do you know the Prisoner ? Good . I have been acquainted with him many Years ; I have been acquainted with him latterly more than formerly ; I have seen him within a Month at least . Q . Did you observe any thing in him different to his former Behaviour ? Good . I look 'd upon him to be very wild with his Eyes , and very melancholy , and like a Person out of his Senses . About half a Year ago he came to me in a very melancholy Way : I endeavouring to know what was the Matter ; at last he turn 'd himself about , Good by , you will never see me any more alive ; I 'll drown myself . With that I caught hold of him , and cry 'd for Mrs. Fox to help me to keep him from making away with himself . Q . Do you know any thing later ? Good Last Saturday se'nnight he came and look 'd very wild with his Eyes ; he threw himself about , but did not sit down ; he look 'd very strange ; he said he was not very well . I ask 'd him if his Wife and himself would come and drink a Dish of Tea with me on the Sabbath-Day ; with that he look 'd in the Glass , and turn 'd himself round , and went out as fast as he could . Q . ( to - Humerston ) What do you know of the Prisoner ? Humerston . I have been acquainted with him for some Years ; but I have not seen much of him within these two or three Months . Q . Have you any Reason to think he was different to was he was formerly . Humerston . He was something phrenzical ; he said he was weary of Life . Court to Charles . Do you know the Prisoner ? Have you been lately acquainted with him within this Month or two ? Do you look upon him to be a Man in his Senses , or out of his Senses ? Charles . I have shav 'd him for this two or three Years ; he always behav 'd very well , and paid me for what I had done for him . We think it may be acceptable to give some Hints of his Lordship 's Charge to the Jury , upon this melancholly Cafe . - What Condition of Mind , or Understanding the Prisoner appear 'd to be at the Time this Fact was done ; they all of them say that his whole Behaviour was sensible in what he went to do ; that he reproach 'd the Deceased the same , as the Deceased did him ; and all his Actions appear 'd to them as cool and as sensible , as any other Person in the Company . The Witnesses were call 'd out , and all gave the same Account ; they always look 'd upon him to be a Man of Understanding . Gentlemen , this is the Evidence to maintain the Indictment . The whole Defence made against it is , that he is a Man that has lately lost his Understanding , has been beside himself , and 't is open 'd by him , or his Council , that this is to be look 'd upon as an Act of an Irational Man , who did not know what he said , or did , and is not to be answerable for any Consequences . I must tell you , that in Point of Law , a Man void of all Sense and Understanding , so degraded to the Condition of a Brute , is no more answerable for such a Fact , than the Instrument by which he does it ; but then it must be one void of Reason and Understanding , and one known to be so . But if a mad Man happens to be so at particular Times , and has lucid Intervals , as we know such Persons have , if at that Time they commit any of these Facts , they are as much answerable for it , as Persons that were never in that unhappy Condition : Whether that is the Condition of the Prisoner at the Bar , you must determine upon Evidence on both Sides , in order to prove that he is not to answer for any Thing he does . Thomas Coates says , about three Years ago , he fell into a melancholly Way , that he was advised to dip his Head in cold Water , and that he was under a religious Melancholly , expressed himself frighten 'd at what would become of him in a future State . These are Circumstances his Master mention 'd ; he seems to give a candid and sure Account . - Now , Gentlemen , in all Accusations of Murder , 't is necessary there must be not only unlawful killing , but by Malice ; that Malice may be implied and collected from Circumstances . 'T is not enough for a Man to say , that he did not intend it , because that would be in the Mouth of the Guilty , as well as the Innocent . In the present Case , the Manner of doing of it , if nothing more , implies Malice . It was secretly cover 'd , and most effectually done in the Manner that all the Witnesses have describ 'd : Done in a Manner , that no Man could possibly make a Defence against ; that is all the Evidence of the deepest Malice . - If on the other Hand there is an Evidence given to you , which induces you to think he was a Man depriv 'd of Reason and Understanding , that is an Excuse allow 'd by the Law ; because unless a Man has Understanding , he can not be guilty of any Crime ; for Crimes are Acts of the Mind . A Man depriv 'd of his Understanding , has no Mind to govern him at all . Death . 217 , 218. William May * and Ruth Walker were indicted ( the first for stealing , and the other for receiving ) 100 lb . Weight of Tobacco , value 50 s . the Goods of Persons unknown . * This William May , for several Sessions past , has convicted one or more at a Time , for stealing very small Quantities of Tobacco . The first Witness against the Prisoner is William Skarf , who says , that the 4th of April at Night , he was set to watch the Lighter of Tobacco , as the King 's Watchman . William May he was set as a Watchman in Behalf of the Merchant , in the same Lighter . He said they had a Drink at the Seven Stars in Water Lane , and he went back again to the Lighter at Seven o'Clock ; that he found May there with a Candle and Lanthorn , and a Hammer in his Hand : He says the Prisoner May desir 'd to let him go on with the Work ; accordingly he consented to it very readily , for they were to share it together . He says he did open one Hogshead which lay at the Side of the Lighter ; that he took some Tobacco out , what particular Quantity he can not say . There were two Hogsheads open 'd in the whole , and out of both there were 112 lb . taken . After this , that he and the Prisoner May both assisted in carrying of it away , and he says the Place they carried it to was the House of one Ruth Walker , who keeps a Cook 's Shop in Harp-Lane . He says the Parcel was carried at three different Times ; that they receiv 'd 18 s. at one Time , and 18 s. at another . The Witness was asked whether she had any Notice that this Tobacco was stolen ; he thinks she knew that very well , that she had often lent Hammers to break them open , and says that he himself made the Discovery of it , voluntarily , before Justice Jones . This Witness was asked by the Prisoner May , whether he was upon Duty that Night ; the Answer he gave , that he was upon Duty . The other Question was , whether he had a Candle and Lanthorn ; the Answer the Evidence gave , that he had heard May declare , that he had no Candle and Lanthorn , or rather that he was not there that Night . The next Witness William Clack , who is a Constable , belongs to the Custom-house , and he was order 'd to take up the Prisoner Ruth Walker . Sharf ( the former Witness ) declar 'd he made this Confession , voluntarily , before he was taken up . The Prisoners were call 'd upon to make their Defence . May said he desir 'd a Person he saw in Court , might be call 'd , one John Webb , to prove that there was no plundering in the Lighter ; he was asked whether he was Land-Waiter to the Ship Neptune , and any plundering in the Lighter . Webb 's Answer , that there was , and he thinks there generally is . Two or three Witnesses appear 'd for the Character of Ruth Walker , and gave her a pretty good one ; but Clack , the Constable , was call 'd upon for her Character , and he says she is a Dealer in Tobacco , or any Thing ; said he , she is sensible , I know it , I have made Seizures as a Custom-house Officer myself . Acquitted . William May was a second Time indicted for an Offence of the like Nature , and Acquitted . 219.
