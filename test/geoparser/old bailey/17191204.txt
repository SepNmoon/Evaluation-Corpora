Pool 's Money and Rings about her . The Gentleman 's Daughter that was in Company confirm 'd the same , and the prisoner acknowledged it with this Variation , viz . That it was at the prosecutor 's desire that he was to call on her at Mr. Dring 's to go home with her ; and that meeting with Harris and Lewis , who ask 'd where he was going , ( and would have otherways engaged him , ) he told them he was going to see the prosecutor safe home to West End , she having Mrs . Pool 's Money and Rings about her ; that he did not communicate it with any ill Intention , but carelesly and innocently : He called several people to his Reputation , who gave him the Character of an Honest Industrous young Man .

The prisoner had got the Receipt from the porter , and as they went to the Ale-house carryed him to an Empty House in Red-Lyon-Square , saying he had taken it for a Shop , and that he should bring the next Goods theither . The prisoner at first deny 'd that he was the person ; then said that he paid the porter for them , and produc 'd Mr. Berry 's Receipt , but was Contradicted by the porter ; he also pleaded that it could not be Felony ; but a Felonious Intent plainly appearing from the beginning to the end , the Jury found him Guilty .
