Thomas Cane and Thomas Dennet ( a little Boy ) were indicted for stealing 2 Mens Hats , val . 21 s. the Goods of George Ithill , in the Parish of St Ann 's Aldersgate , July 15 . George Ithill . I was out of Town when the Fact was done ; I only say the Goods were mine ; I saw them at the Constable 's House ; but I know nothing of the Prisoners : I never saw them before . Mary Cross . I saw the Man at the Bar ( Cane ) take the 2 Hats out of the Shop-Window , in St Martin 's , - I ca n't remember the day of the Month . Ithill . It was the 15th of July . Cross . The Hats were just going to be pack 'd up , in order to be sent to Bristol . I know Cane is the Man who took them , for I saw his face , and he was taken immediately , - within a quarter of an Hour - at a Barber 's Shop , just at the next Door . Joseph Monday . I was Mr Ithill 's Apprentice , and was packing up Goods in the Shop , at the time these 2 Hats were stole . Mrs Cross sat near the Window from whence they were taken ; and while I was busy , she cryed out , - a Man has taken a Hat , and has run away with it ! I ran to the Door , but saw no body near ; She made a Motion with her hand , to shew me which way he went , so I looked towards Angel-Street , and saw a Boy , ( the Prisoner Dennet ) putting something under his apron . I pursued him 4 or 5 Doors up Angel-Street and seized him . I asked him what he had got under his Apron , and he told me he had nothing ; but upon my turning up his Apron , there were these two Hats . I am sure they are Mr Ithill 's , for here are the Marks which I put upon them ; and I am positive Dennet is the Boy I took them from ; for I took the Goods from him , and brought him back to our Shop , and as I passed by the Barber 's Shop at next Door , the Barber called me in , and told me he believed he had got the Boy 's Confederate ; so I took both the Man and the Boy into our Shop , and charged a Constable with them . We asked them if they knew one another , and they said no , they did not ; and denied that they knew any thing of the matter , only the Boy said , he picked them up under the Shop-Window . Upon this we carried them before the Lord-Mayor , and being obliged to wait a little while for a Hearing , we went to the Fleece Alehouse , and there the Prisoner Cane desired us to speak favourably of him before my Lord-Mayor , and then he would go to Sea directly , and would never be seen again here . The Barber asked him twice if his name was not Perkins ? He told him , it was not . Yes it is , says the Barber , and you * was tryed last Sessions for stealing wet Linnen . He was asked again what his name was , and he said it was Thomas Cane . * Thomas Perkins and John Cable were tryed last Sessions , for stealing 2 Shirts . Perkins was then acquitted , and Cable cast for transportation . Thomas Parker . I am a Peruke-maker , and live next Door to Mr Ithill . I saw the 2 Prisoners , the Man and the Boy , talking together about 2 Minutes at my Window , and very soon after this the Man ( Cane ) chopp 'd into my Shop , and seemed to be very much surpriz 'd , which gave me a suspicion that he was a Thief . I had seen Mr Ithill 's Man run past my Window , and seeing him come back again with the Boy , I asked him to come into my Shop , for I believed I had got the Boy 's Companion . I did not see any thing of the Robbery , only the Man came into my Shop in a Flurry , and pull 'd off his Wig , and desired me to comb it , tho ' it looked as if it had been just comb 'd , and having seen him talk to the Boy but a little before at my Window , it made me suspect they were Confederates . Prisoner Dennet . Ask him if he is sure I was the Boy that Cane was talking to ? Parker . Yes , I am . Joseph Monday . I am sure he was the Boy I took the Hats from , in Angel street . Prisoner Cane . I was going along St Martin 's , and a Cart coming by , I went in at the Barber 's to have my Wig powdered , and called for Water to wash my Hands and Face : while I was in the Shop they took this Boy , and bringing him back , the Barber went out to know what was the Matter , and so he brought the People in , to see if I was not the Man who took the Hats . The Woman ( Mrs Cross ) said she knew me by my blue Coat ; I told her , that was very hard , - because many others wear blue Coats ; but then she looked in my Face , and said , she would swear I was the Man who took them , tho ' I am a Chair-maker by Trade , and work hard for every Bit of Bread I eat . Dennet the Boy . I was but just come out of the Country , and was going down St Martin 's to see my Aunt , and a Cart coming by had like to have gone over the Hats , but I was for picking them up , and then I put them under my Apron . The young Man followed me , and asked me what I had got ? I told him I had got two Hats , and that I had found them ; so I gave them to him directly . I have no Friends here ; they are all at Charlton in Kent . Both Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 364. Edward Paine , of St Matthew Friday-street , was indicted for stealing 23 Pence Halfpenny , the Money of William Marshall , August 25 . Mr Marshall . The Prisoner came to live with me as a Servant , about the 14th of July last : [ I am an Oilman in Friday street . ] While he was in my Service , I miss 'd Money several Times out of a little petty Drawer , which we call the Till : so on Friday , August 22 , having taken Notice of what was in it , I went out early in the Morning , and left only the Prisoner and another Servant in the Shop . I returned in about an Hour , and miss 'd 4 d. On Sabbath-Day following I got up early in the Morning , and saw there was Six-pence Half-penny in the Till ; when Afternoon-Sermon was over there was Three-Pence gone . About six o'Clock ( the same Day ) I call 'd my Son , and we went down Stairs , and we marked two Six-pences , and eighteen Pennyworth of Copper , which we put into the Till . On Monday Morning I got up at 5 o'Clock , and then we miss 'd 1 s. and 2 d. of the marked Money . After this I went out , leaving the Prisoner alone in the Shop ; and I sent a Person to buy several Things , for which I sent home mark 'd Money . Out of this Money I miss 'd 21 d. when I returned . Then I sent for Mr Makepeace the Constable , and having taken the Prisoner up into my Dining-Room , I tax 'd him with having wrong 'd me , and told him I had miss 'd Money several Times . He deny 'd all ; but upon obliging him to pull out what Money he had in his Pocket , I found a Shilling and a Sixpence in Silver , and 11 Halfpence of the mark 'd Money . He had more Money upon him , but it not being marked , I can not swear to it . I then carried him before Sir William Rous , and he committed him . He acknowledged the Fact , and when I told him I had mark 'd the Money , he said , - the Devil tempted him to do it . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 365. Richard Nichols was indicted for stealing 22 Yards of printed Linnen , value 30 s. the Goods of Hannah and Phaenetta Early , Aug. 16 . Phaenetta Early . Last Saturday was a Fortnight , about 9 at Night , that Man ( the Prisoner ) took 22 Yards of printed Linnen out of our Shop window . My Sister and I are Partners ; her Name is Hannah Early . As soon as he had got it he ran away ; I pursued him , and he was taken within 3 Minutes Time , but he had not the Goods upon him . I saw them in the Shop the Minute before he took them , and I saw him take them , and run away with them ; and I and my Sister followed him crying Stop Thief . This young Man ( John Cook ) pursued him and took him , and brought him back to us , but the Goods he had flung away , and they were picked up out of the Kennel . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man . Lewis Boyn . Here is the Linnen . Mrs Early . I am sure this is the same we then lost . Boyn . Last Saturday was a Fortnight I found this Linnen in the Kennel , as I was crossing the Street ( Fish-street-Hill ) towards their House ; but I ca n't say who dropp 'd it . I heard the Peoply cry - Stop Thief ! and saw the Prisoner run ; Mr Cook pursued him , and took him at the Corner of East-cheap . James Tame . I was going down Fish street-Hill last Saturday was a Fortnight , and heard a Cry of Stop Thief ! At the same Time I saw the Prisoner turn from Mrs Early 's Shop , and I followed him to the Corner of Eastcheap , where he was taken ; and being brought back to the Shop , Mrs Early said he was the Man who had robb 'd them . He would not own any Thing , nor make any Confession , nor did I see him take any Thing out of the Shop , for he was about half a score Yards Distance from it , when I began to pursue him . John Cook . On Saturday last was a Fortnight , about 9 o'Clock at Night , I was going with Letters to the Post-Office , and as I crossed over Fish-street-Hill , I saw the Prisoner in this Gentlewoman 's Shop , and saw him take the Linnen off the Counter , or from the Window , I am not sure whether it was from the Window , or the Counter ; nor can I be sure he had any Thing in his Hand when he ran out ; but I saw him run out , and pursued him to the Corner of Eastcheap , and help 'd to take him . He did not own the Fact , but the Goods were immediately pick 'd up , and brought to the Shop . Defence . I am a Seafaring Man , and belong to a Turkey Merchant-Man , and was then going Home ; I heard the Gentlewoman cry Stop Thief , and there being a Mob about the Door , I stopp 'd to see what was the Matter ; upon which they took me into the Shop , and asked me for the Linnen , telling me , if I would inform them where it was , they would let me go . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 366. George Kendall was indicted for stealing 3 Bushels of Coals , val . 2 s. and 9 d. the Goods of Robert French , in the Parish of St Martin in the Fields . July 8 . Robert French . I lost a Sack of Coals ( containing 3 Bushels ) on the 8th of July last , out of a a Cart . As the Prisoner was going with the Cart to a Customer , he stopp 'd and sold a Sack in Hedge-Lane . I did not see him do this , but he has confessed it , and that he sold the Coals there . There was another Man with the Cart beside the Prisoner , and he is gone off for Fear I should take him up . When he was before Mr. Justice Poulson , he owned he sold a Sack of my Coals out of the Cart , ( which he was driving to a Customer ) to one Mrs Jane Jones , who lives at the Sign of the 2 Brewers in Hedge-Lane , and that Mrs. Jones gave him two Shillings and a Full-pot of Beer for them . Prisoner . My Fellow-Servant loaded 14 Sacks of Coals into the Cart , and we were going with them to Scotland-Yard . As we went thither he bid me stop , and carry a Sack to Hedge-Lane , and tell the Woman they came from John Mitchell ; so I took the Coals , and carry 'd them there , and he had the Money ; I only had a Draught of the Beer . Mr. French . He confessed that some Time after he had received the Money , he gave his Partner one Shilling , and kept the other himself . Guilty 10 d. 367. Jane Jones , of St Martins in the Fields , was afterwards indicted for receiving the said 3 Bushels of Coals , knowing them to be stole . July 8 . But Mr. French having nothing to offer in Proof of the Fact , but the Confession of the above-mention 'd Felon , the Prisoner was acquitted . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 368. Henry Holmes of St Martin in the Fields , was indicted for stealing 2 silk Gowns , val . 3 l. a silk Petticoat , val . 10 s. a Yard of Silk , val . 1 s. a Woman 's short Cloak , val . 10 s. a quilted Coat , val . 2 s. 2 Shifts , val . 3 s. 3 Aprons , val . 3 s. and 2 Suits of laced Headcloths , val . 4 s. the Goods of James Hollingsworth . June 16 . Grace Hollingsworth . I live at the Plume of Feathers in Tyburn Road , and my Husband James Hollingsworth is a Coachman . I lost a Bundle of Wearing Apparel , - a Suit of yellow silk Cloaths , that is , a Gown and Petticoat , worth about 40 s. a dark grey silk Night Gown worth about 20 s. a short cloath Cloak worth about 10 s. a green silk quilted Petticoat worth 5 s. a piece of Silk belonging to it worth 1 s. 2 Shifts worth half a Crown , 3 Aprons worth 2 s. and 2 suits of edged Headcloths worth 3 s. These I packed up in a bundle together , with my own hands , at one Mr. Wakefield 's in Shoreditch , who is an acquaintance of mine , and on Whitsunday last , I sent Philip Hudson for the bundle , and he tells me he lost it as he was bringing it to me . I have heard nothing of my Things , nor do I know any thing of the Prisoner . Philip Hudson . Mrs. Hollingsworth sent me , on Whitsunday last , for a Bundle she had left at Mr Wakefield 's in Shoreditch . I do n't know what was in it , but it was a pretty large bundle . I took it from Mr Wakefield 's , and was to call for another , in Little Moorfields , which belonged to another Woman . As I was going over Moorfields , I met the Prisoner in a light cap 'd Coat , and another Man in Soldier 's Cloaths , and they went with me to the House where I was to call for the other Parcel . The biggest Bundle ( which was Mrs Holling sworth 's ) I put upon my Head ; the other I carried under my Arm , in the Lappet of my Coat . The Prisoner would have taken the little one to have carried for me , at the House from whence I took it , but I would not let him have it . However they followed me , and the Prisoner said again - Comrade , you are loaded , I will carry one parcel a little way for you . Well , Comrade , says I , if you will , I will let you ; and so he took Mrs Holling sworth 's Parcel , which weighed ( I believe ) about 40 or 50 lb . and came with me from Little Moorfields to Cripplegate Church , where he bid me go along , and then he slipped away from me . I thought he must go up Whitecross Street , so I turn 'd up there , and enquired after the Prisoner . A Man told me he had seen such a Person , and if I made haste I should catch him ; but I saw nothing of him , 'till he was taken up at Whitehall ; which was about a Fortnight after this happened . I have never set my Eyes upon the things since , nor would the Prisoner confess any thing when he was apprehended , but he is the man , - I am positively sure he is the Man . Prisoner . I am a Soldier in Colonel Long 's Company , in the First Regiment of Foot Guards , and was taken up on account of my missing Muster , and was sent to the Savoy , and being tryed by a Court-Martial , they accused me of this thing , in hopes of making a property of me . I keep a House at St Catherine 's ; and they charged me with this , and let it run 3 Weeks and odd Days , before they apprehended me ; and when they carried me before Colonel De Veil , I told him I was never absent from my House , but Mornings and Nights . John Cook . I have known the Prisoner 8 or 9 years ; he sometimes does labouring Work upon the Keys : I never knew him do an ill thing in my life . Ann Cook . I have known him 20 Years and better . I never knew that he was before a Justice for the least crime in the World ; but he has worked for his 2 children ever since his Wife has been dead , and that 's these 7 Years . Anthony Whitehead , Methuselah Miller , and James Stanton gave him a good Character . Acquitted . 369 . + Thomas Hutchins of the Precinct of St Catherine 's , was indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , val . 9 l. the Goods of William Culling in his Dwelling-house , August 7 . William Culling . That 's the Gentleman - I know him very well . I keep the Sign of the Black Boy , 't is both a Tavern and an Alehouse , in St Catherine 's . On the 7th of August I lost a silver Tankard out of the Fore-room , - a publick Room , from the third Box in the Room . I missed it between 6 and 7 in the Evening , and saw it but the Moment before it was gone . The Prisoner was drinking out of it ; and while he had it before him , my Wife ( who had been abroad ) was brought home ill ; I went to the Door , and took her in my arms to carry her into the House , and in the mean time the Prisoner went away with the Tankard . I missed both him , and That , the Moment he went out ; and asked the People in the House , if they had taken it away . They all said , they knew nothing of it ; but while I was looking about for it , a Boy came running into the House , and told me , the Prisoner was stopped about 200 Yards off , with my Tankard upon him . I went out , and found the People had stopped him with it , and had seen my Name at the Bottom of the Tankard . 'T is in the Officer 's Hands , and he is here . James Down , Headborough . This is the Tankard which ( they said ) was found upon the Prisoner . Mr Culling . This is mine , and here 's my Name upon the Bottom of it . Mr Down . I received it at Mr Justice Rickards 's : He delivered it to me to keep and bring here . I know nothing of the Prisoner . Mr Culling . The Prisoner owned he took it out of my House , and I said to him , - Sirrah , how dare you come in to rob me , when I have used you so well ? Why really , says he , I did not come into the House with such a Design , but I was forced upon it . I remember I saw a Man and a Woman sitting with him ; and the Woman had a Hat on , and she had a black Eye ; so I asked him who they were that forced him to it ? No ; he would not tell , he would rather die than tell , - he would rather chuse to be hang 'd : the Man and the Woman were gone , and he would not tell who they were . Jury . Were the Man and the Woman with him , when you saw him last in the House ? Mr Culling . When I carry 'd my Wife in , they were with him ; when I came into the Room again , they were all gone . The Tankard is worth about 9 or 10 L. Joanna Pain . I was going down St Catherine's-Lane , and about three Doors down the Lane on the Left-hand , a Woman said , - there 's a Man coming along , who has stole a Pot , or a Tankard . I said , - then Faith he shall not carry it off , if he has stole it . So the Wind blew hard , and the Bell had just rung 7 o'Clock , and I pursued the Prisoner . He went up to a Gate , and took the Tankard out of his Breeches . What have you got there , says I ? Nothing , ( cry 'd he ) but what 's my own . What 's your own , says I to him , why you do n't look like a Man that is Master of such a Piece of Plate , and swearing an Oath , - I hope 't is no Offence , - By G - , says I , you shall not carry it off , so I clapp 'd hold of the Waistband of his Breeches with one Hand , and twisted the Tankard out of his Hand , with the other . Then I hauled him out to the middle of the Lane , and called out , Stop Thief ! I attacked him in this Affair , and held him fast , till one Mr Atkins came up to my Assistance , and then we carry 'd him to an Alehouse ; and People coming about us , says I to them , - Here 's a Man has stole a Tankard , - I believe 't is Culling 's , and I took it out of his Breeches . Upon this a Man examined it , and found Culling 's Name at the Bottom . This is the very same Tankard which I took out of that Fellow 's Breeches . The People at the Alehouse ask 'd him how he came by it ? He then said he did not know ; but when he was before Mr Justice Richards , he said he found it . He was ask 'd , where he found it ? He said , at first , he found it in his Breeches , and afterwards , that a Woman gave it him . Aye , said the Justice , she was a mighty kind Woman indeed , to make you a present of a Silver Tankard , which was none of her own ! Pray what Woman was this ? He would not confess who gave it him , but said he would sooner die , than tell who she was . His Examination was taken down in Writing , and he might have signed it if he would , but he would not . William Atkins . I heard a Dispute , in the Street , and saw this Woman ( Joe Pain ) and the Prisoner , contending for a Tankard . He held up the Tankard , and I thought she was only struggling with him for some of the Beer ; but Mrs Mead telling me the Man had stole the Tankard , and desiring me to go and help Joe , I went to her Assistance , but she had got the Tankard from him , before I laid hold of him . With her Assistance we carry 'd him into the Thistle and Crown Alehouse ; there I saw Mr Culling 's Name upon the Bottom of the Tankard , and he , being sent for , owned it . The Prisoner seemed to be a little in Liquor , and made some frivolous Excuses : He said he did not take it himself , but that a Woman gave it him ; and he would sooner die than discover who the Woman was . Prisoner . I was drinking at Mr Culling 's , and was in Liquor . There were two Persons with me there : the Man I know ; the Woman I do not know , nor her Name , no more than the Child unborn ; but some how or other she brought the Tankard out . I never wrong 'd Man , Woman , or Child , in no Case , but have been a hard-working Man all my Life . Thomas Green . The Prisoner is a Brewer 's Servant ; he has lived next Door to me these 7 Years ; he has got six Children , and his Wife is with Child again : I never heard any Harm of him before , but as far as I know , he always worked hard for his Living . Elizabeth Carter . I have known him 11 Years ; I never knew any Thing amiss of him , but that he was a hard-working Man . He was very much fuddled to my Knowledge , for I saw him that Night . And the Night before he was very drunk at our House . Rebecca Boyington . I have known him 4 or 5 Years ; he has a large Family , and I never heard any Ill of him before . Sarah Parker . I have known him 11 Years , and never knew he wrong 'd any one of a Farthing . I saw him that Afternoon when this was done , and he was fuddled ; he was drunk the Day before , and the Day before That . - He was drunk three Days together , and he has a vast Family , and his Wife 's big again . Mr Down . He was pretty much in Liquor , when I took him into Custody . Guilty 39s . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 370 . + Ann Parker was indicted for stealing a Silver Watch and Chain , val . 3 l. the Property of Patrick Mooney , in the Dwelling-house of John Hill , in the Parish of St Giles in the Fields , August 25 . Patrick Mooney . The Prisoner and I were in a Room together , ( last Monday Morning was Seven-night ) in the House of John Hill , in Parker's-Lane , St Giles 's ; and between one and eight in the Morning , I lost my Watch . Mrs Parker , the Prisoner , carry 'd me there , - I was not rightly in my Senses , but was a little Matter in Liquor . I met her between 10 and 11 at Night , ( to the best of my Knowledge ) and staid with her till between 9 and 10 the next Morning ; and while I was with her , I lost a Silver Watch , Chain , and Seal . I am sure I carry 'd it into the Room with me , and to my certain Knowledge I had it in the Room , for I looked at it at one Clock , ( in the Night ) and said I would go Home , but she would not let me , - she said it was too late . So I slept there , and miss 'd my Watch between 7 and 8 in the Morning . I met her that Night at a Beer-house opposite her Lodgings , and there was a Man in her Company who came with us to her Room ; I slept upon her Bed , and the Man staid in the Room , till between 6 and 7 in the Morning . I do n't know that the Prisoner took my Watch , - but I am sure I lost it in her Room . Prisoner . Ask him whether he was not very drunk , when he came to me at the Alehouse ? And whether he did not pawn his Buckles , because he had no Money after the Gentleman and he came to my Room ? Mr Mooney is no Stranger to me ; he and I have been acquainted these two Years and a half . Mooney . I have known her these two Years ; and though I lost my Watch in her Room , I ca n't say who took it . Prisoner . He was very drunk when he came to my Room , and I would not let him go Home for Fear he should be robb 'd . I have been acquainted with him a great while - to my Disadvantage . Mr Brown . ( Constable and Pawnbroker . ) On Monday Seven-night ( about half an Hour after nine in the Morning ) the Prisoner came to me with this Watch , to pledge for three Guineas . I asked her whose it was ? she said it was her own . I told her , I supposed she did not wear a Silver Watch and Chain ; but she still said it was her 's , - she should fetch it again , and what was that to me . I told her I must know who was the Owner of the Watch , and where he liv 'd , before I parted with it : and then she said , she was at present with a Gentlewoman in Piccadilly , who knew where she liv 'd . That ( says I ) is no Satisfaction to me . Why then ( reply 'd she ) 't is my Husband 's Watch , and he is gone to Sea , - give me the Watch again . I refused to do it , and took her before Mr Justice Frasier , where she said the Watch belonged to one Mooney a Cabinet-maker , and that Mooney had been gone to Sea a Month . She was asked where she lived ? She told us she liv 'd in Long-Acre : upon which I offered to go to Long-Acre , to enquire after her , but she then said she liv 'd in Parker's-Lane , and finding I was resolved to go to her Lodgings , she desired to go with me , and said she would go to an Alehouse , and would send for the Person who owned the Watch . Then it came out , that the Owner of it was in Town , and lived by the New-Church in the Strand ; but when we came to the New Church , she could not shew me where he lived . Prithee , says I , let 's go and see if you can find out your own Lodgings . Accordingly she went with me , and would have carried me into an Alehouse , in her Neighbourhood , ( Parker's-Lane ) but seeing a Parcel of mean People there . I refused to go in ; and so she went with me to the House where she lodged , and her Landlady informed me , that the Prisoner had lived there upwards of a Quarter of a Year , and that this was but the second Quarter . While we were talking together , a Messenger came from the Alehouse over the Way , and told the Prisoner there was one at their House desired to speak with her . I insisted upon it , that whoever wanted her , must come over to her ; upon which Mooney came and said , - He had lost his Watch , and that it was picked out of his Pocket the Night before . Then I carried the Prisoner before Mr Frasier , and Mooney made the same Information he has made here . Prisoner . Ask Mr Brown , whether Mooney was not desirous to recal what he had said , knowing he had done me Injustice ? Mr Brown . So far from that , that he insisted upon her having taken it ; and she said , Mooney was a Villain , and had ruined her ; and if she had taken 10 Watches from him , he ought not to have sworn against her . She called him ill Names , and he said , she had brought it all upon herself . Defence . Last Sunday was Se'nnight at Night , Mooney came to the Alehouse where I was drinking , and I was surprized to see him so fuddled ; and not having seen him for a fortnight before , - pray sit down says I , you are very welcome . I was just going home to bed , but he was resolved to drink before he stirred ; so he called for a Pot of Beer , and not having any Money , he took out his Knee-Buckles and pawned them for the Beer . Then we went to my Room , and had another Pot there . About One he wanted to go Home ; I thought it was too late , and as he was in drink , I perswaded him to lie down . Then says I , my Dear , I want a pair of Shoes , lend me a Crown to buy a pair . Dear Nanny says he , You know I have no Money ; - I pawned my Knee Buckles to pay for the Beer : However ( says he ) take this Watch , and pawn it for a Guinea ; for I ca n't go home without my Buckles . Ask him if I have not had this Watch in my Custody very often , before that Time . Mooney . Yes , she has often had it ; and she might have made bold with it before , as she has done now . - I missed it about 8 o'clock on Monday Morning ; and she said , she knew nothing of it . The other Man who had been with us , was gone , when I missed it , and she never pretended that He might take it ; she only said , she would go out and enquire of Him , if he knew where it was : and accordingly she went out , about the Time she offered it to Mr Brown , and I waited for her Return till between 9 and 10 . Acquitted . 371. Henry Clark , of St James 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing a silver Tankard , val . 7 l. the Goods of John Minton , July 29 . John Minton . I keep a Publick House in St James 's Street . On the 29th of July last , 2 Gentlemen came who were Customers to my House , and called for a Tankard of Beer , in a little Yard before the Door . I served them in a silver Tankard , and when they had drank the Liquor , they called for more ; I filled it again , and the Prisoner ( a Chairman ) using my House , being in the Yard , they asked him to drink . The Gentlemen went away , and left the Prisoner in the Yard ; and in an Hour 's Time I missed the Tankard . I was in a fright about it , and remembred that no body else had been at the House . By and by , ( soon after this ) in comes one of the Gentlemen who had drank out of the Tankard ; I asked him if he knew any thing of it ? He told me it was left with Harry Clark ( the Prisoner ) upon the Bench in the Yard . So the next Morning I went to the Prisoner 's Lodgings , but he was gone out to work ; then I went directly to the Pawnbrokers , and desired them to stop it if it should be offered . But hearing nothing of it , I went to the other Gentleman who had been in Company , and he likewise told me , the Tankard was left upon the Bench with Harry Clark . At 8 o'clock the next Morning the Prisoner came to Breakfast , and I asked him about it . He owned it was left with him , - but d - mn your Tankard , ( said he ) am I obliged to look after it ? Do you think I have it ? This made me dubious about taking him up ; so I advertised it , and was in hopes it would be brought me for the Sake of the Reward . Four or 5 Days after I spake to him again , and told him , I would not expose him , but that I had reason to suspect him . He utterly denied all , and asked me what Business I had at his Lodgings without a Constable ? Why , Harry , says I , I only come to ask you about it , - I hope that every one who comes to ask for you , do n't come with a Constable . After all the Enquiry I could make , I could hear nothing of it ; so upon the 8th of August I got a Warrant , and took the Gentlemen and the Prisoner before Mr Justice De Veil , who clear 'd them , and said he must commit the Prisoner . When the Prisoner heard this , he took me into the Yard , and asked me what I intended to do ; and said , he hoped I would not send him to Prison , and declar 'd to me that he had not the Tankard . I told Colonel De Veil that I missed him and the Tankard together , and that no soul came to the House , but these People , before I missed it . He desired me ( if I could ) to put off his Commitment for 2 or 3 days ; I told him if he would let me have my Tankard again , I would beg he might be only sent to the Round-House . Then he wanted me to put it off for a Fortnight ; and upon my telling him I could not do it , he said he would give me 2 Guineas down , and a Note of Hand for the rest ; but upon my relating this Proposal to Colonel De Viel , he told me I must not accept of it . Richard Woodyere . William Tessbury and I went to the Prosecutor 's House , and we had a Tankard filled twice , and asked the Prisoner to drink . When we came away , we left the Tankard upon the Bench in the Yard , at a little Distance from the Prisoner , and there was no one but he in the Yard . We did not speak to him to take care of it , for we imagined he would do it , as he drank Part of the Beer , and was one who constantly used the House . About an Hour afterwards I came back to Mr Minton 's ; he asked me about the Tankard , and I told him I set it down within 5 or 6 Foot from the Prisoner , upon the Bench . William Tessbury gave exactly the same Account . Prisoner . Ask Mr Tessbury if it was left in my Possession ? Tessbury . It was so far in his Possession , that it was on the Bench in the Yard , where he was sitting , and we thought , as he used the House , that it was left safe . James Tomes . On the 29th of July , in the Evening , I was call 'd off with a Horse-Jobb to Clare-Market : when I went away with the Jobb , I left the Prisoner and the two last Witnesses , drinking out of a Tankard in the Yard . When I came back again , the two Men were gone , and there was no body in the Yard but the Prisoner . My Partner wanting to hang the Horse to a Nail over the Bench where the Prisoner sat ; and it being above the Prisoner 's Head , my Partner desired him to get up , that he might hang the Horse up . He made no Answer at all ; so my Partner spoke to him a second Time , and then he only slid his Backside along the Bench , and leaned his Head on one Side , that we might reach to the Nail . I did not see the Tankard at all ; but I heard him acknowledge at the Justice 's , that the two Men left it with him , and he offered to pay for it in my Hearing . George Fewterel , Tomes 's Partner , gave the same Account . Defence . I own I used this Man 's House , and that these two Men had been drinking that Evening in the Yard . I had been drinking myself , and came and laid my self down on the Bench , and these Men asked me to drink out of their Tankard . I drank most of the Beer myself , and gave the Tankard into one of their Hands ; then I went to sleep again , and they went away without saying any Thing about the Tankard to me , and there was a Jew there , an ill-looking Rascal , as ever you saw in your Life , that sells Buckles and Studds about the Streets ; and if any Man had the Tankard , I must think he had it . I am a Chairman in the Winter , and in the Summer I follow labouring Work , and am a Man that 's never idle . At that Time I worked with a Man in Basinghall-street , and at 6 o'Clock I came to this Mr Minton 's , and having got my Supper , went to my Lodging in Red-lion-street , about 9 o'Clock . On the Tuesday following , I met a Friend in the City , who told me Mr Minton suspected I had his Tankard , because I did not use his House as usual ; therefore I went thither , and called for a Pint of Beer . Mr Minton then told me , he was uneasy about his Tankard , and asked me to go with him before Colonel De Veil to be examined , with these two Men . I told him , I would go Home and put on a clean Shirt , because I did not care to appear as a Bricklayer 's Labourer , and that I would come to him in half an Hour . Accordingly I went Home , and cleaned myself , and returned to Mr Minton 's ; but the two Men not being come , I waited for them , and at Length we all went before Colonel De Veil . Now if I had had the Tankard , I should hardly have gone with him before the Justice ; I had Time enough to have got off . - I am hired by the Week to carry Mr Copping Williams , and in a Morning I clean his Plate to the Value of some Thousands of Pounds , and I have had more Opportunity to steal his Plate , than this poor Man 's Tankard . My Prosecutor is as honest a Man as any in the World , and would not take a false Oath , - but he is set upon it . My Character was never stained before , but now it is out of my Power to get my Bread in England . Woodyere . He says he was asleep while we were in the Yard ; but he did not sleep , nor appear drowsy at all ; but sat as upright as I am now . I believe too that he was not in Liquor : I take it that he was but just come from Work . Sarah Worthington , Dorothy Newington , Frances Brocket , John Wintersham , gave the Prisoner a good Character . The Prisoner desired Mr Minton might be asked , if he did not go before the Justice , without a Warrant . Mr Minton answered , that he desired the Prisoner to go before a Justice and clear his Character , and offered to pay him for half a Day 's Work , because the Prisoner made Words about losing so much Time : upon which he agreed to go , and did so , before the Warrant was served upon him . Acquitted . 372 , 373 . + Patrick King , otherwise Webb , otherwise Crawford , and Patrick Branegan , otherwise Alexander Brannan , were indicted for assaulting Elizabeth the Wife of Richard Watson , on the King 's Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her 2 India Handkerchiefs , value 4 s. and a Gold Ring , val . 14 s. the Goods of the said Elizabeth Watson , August 19 . Elizabeth Watson was called , but did not appear . Robert Rhodes . I took the Prisoners up , at two different Times ; and as to Branegan , I believe him to be as innocent as I am . King was very much frighted when he was taken , but I believe him to be innocent too . I know Elizabeth Watson to be a desperate Woman ; and one that would not scruple to swear any Man 's Life away . A Gentleman in the Commission informed the Court , that the Prosecutrix came before him , in July 1739 , and made herself an Evidence in five or six Robberies , and a Murder ; and that she was a Thief in all those Robberies . That in this Affair she came to him , and he thought her a Person not fit to be believed , and would not take her Information .

July 14 . Elizabeth Brodier . I live in Bear-Alley , near the Fleet-Market ; on the 14th of July , I came home about 11 o'Clock , having been out a little later than ordinary , and this Prisoner ( whom I have known some Years , by passing up and down , tho ' I never spoke to her in my Life ) as I was passing along , was sitting at the Crown and Anchor Door , next the Market , and another Woman was sitting with her . I was going home quietly , and thinking nothing , the Prisoner rose from the Alehouse-Door , and came up to me , and called out Kate , and swore a great Oath , that I should go and lie with her that Night ; I made answer again , and said , - Hussy , I have no Business to go Home with you ; I have a Husband and Children to go Home to . With that she knock 'd me down with her Fist , and took out of my Pocket what I had . I had but 18 d. in Money , a Pair of Steel Scissars , and some odd Trifles . She left me there for dead , and ran away ; and I was bad enough for a Month after it . She did nothing to me , but strike me with her Fist , yet I was so sore , that I was bad a Month after it . It was Eleven o'Clock at Night , when this was done ; but it was just under a Lamp , not three Yards from the Crown and Anchor Alehouse-Door . When I was a little recovered , I got up , but she was gone ; so I went after her next Morning , being an ill Creature in the Place , and always robbing every Body she came nigh ; for she robb 'd me on the 14th of July , and on the Friday following I took her my own self , in the Fleet-Market . She was sitting in the Fleet-Market , so I went to her , and took her , and she beat me sore that Time ; but I took her to an Alehouse , and a Gentleman went for a Constable to help me , and we took her before my Lord-Mayor . 'T was on the Monday Night she robb 'd me , and the next Morning I heard where she liv 'd ; People told me she liv 'd in an ill Place , in Love's-Court . When she was before my Lord-Mayor , she confess 'd that it was the other Woman ( who was with her ) that robbed me , and that she had then on the same Gown , which the Prisoner has on now . She said the other Woman had the Gown on , when she robbed me , that the Prisoner her self had on when I took her . When I went into Love's-Court , I went to an ill House which the Prisoner resorted to , and which is kept by one Rachael , - but I do n't know her other Name , and there I saw some trifling Things of mine , - a Tea-spoon , and my Scissars , but I could not have them , because as the Prisoner had pawned them for Gin , the People refused to deliver them to me . I was advised to take my Husband and another with me , and go and demand the Things , but they having robb 'd a Gentleman of 6 Guineas , and his Watch , and stripp 'd him of his Cloaths , are all run away . I formerly kept a Publick-House myself , of 45 l. a Year , and knew the Prisoner by coming up and down the Market . Prisoner . I never saw her in my Life : Pray ask her why she did not cry out Stop Thief . Brodier . As soon as I recovered myself , I cry 'd out Stop Thief , and ran towards Holburn-Bridge , and call 'd the Watch ; but they were all gone to beat their Rounds . Judith Wilmot . I know nothing of this Fact , but the Prisoner has brought People to rob me . Abraham Brodier . I know my Wife came home on the 14th of July , the Day before St. Swithin 's Day , about 11 o'clock at Night , very much puddered and frighted . Her right Cheek Bone was bloody , and she was muddy , and dirty . I asked her what was the matter ? she said she had been robbed and beat , by Betty Green . Her Knees were black and blue ; and she had a Bruise upon her Head . I was not with her when she was robbed , so I can say nothing to that . But she came home in a Pucker , and in such a manner . Prisoner . I work hard for my Bread ; and had just finish 'd a Sieve of Currants , when she took me up . I never saw him in my Life , before he came to me , in our Brideswell , and told me , he would hang me if it was in his Power .

July 29 . John Lambert . On the 28th of July last , I went out to a Club Feast , and happened to get a a little in Liquor , and so I came home late . When I came to my Door , instead of going into the house , I sat down at the Door , and fell fast a-sleep . When I waked I found my Shoes were taken off my Feet , my Shoe-Buckles , Knee-Buckles , and my Hat were taken away too . The next Day I gave notice to the Shops , where such Things are bought , to stop them , if they came to be sold . The Shoes being a very remarkable pair of Shoes , - such a Pair , as I am sure , are not in London again , - they were brought the next day , to be sold at the next Shop , - next Door to where I live ; but I do n't know the Person 's Name they were offered to . So I having given an Account in the Morning , that if such a remarkable Pair of Shoes should be offered to sale , they must stop them . I had notice that they were stopp 'd , and I am positive they are the same which were taken off my Feet , while I was a-sleep at the Door . John Fern . The Prisoner at the Bar came to sell these Pumps , ( now under my arm ) and this Man ( Lambert ) having given me Information of them the Day before , I stopped them , being a very particular Pair , - double channell 'd , block heel 'd , and stitch 'd .

I keep 2 Cellars , and deal in the second-hand-way ; I sell second-hand Boots and Shoes , and Lambert after he had lost his Shoes , went through our whole Trade , to give notice of them ; and I swear the Prisoner offered to sell them to me .

June 30 . Robert Moone . I have seen the Prisoner , but as to the Fact , I ca n't say she took my Things . I was coming home the 29th , or 30th of June last , a little late , and a little in Liquor , - 't was between 2 and 3 in the Morning , - and as I was going towards my own home , - towards Covent-Garden , a Woman took me up , and carried me to the Jersey Coffee House , in Covent-Garden ; one Hyat keeps the House . There I was supply 'd with something to drink ; which , with what I had drank before , made me more and more in Liquor . After I had drank there , the Woman who pick 'd me up , carried me to Jones 's Bagnio , at the Sign of the Turk's-Head , in Bow-street , Covent-Garden : and there I believe I was put upon the Bed , and being in Liquor , I fell a-sleep ; and being a-sleep , - I slept for an Hour , or an Hour and a half , and then I wak 'd ; and being awake , - I called up some of the People of the House , to tell me where I was . The Keeper of the Bagnio came up , and told me I was at the Turk's-Head Bagnio , in Bow-Street . I informed him I was robbed of my Gold Watch , a silver Snuff-box , and silver Tooth-pick Case . I really ca n't say I was robbed at the Bagnio , but I will take my Oath , I had them at Hyat 's House , the Jersey Coffee House ; for I pulled my Watch out there , and told the Bar-keeper , I was not capable of seeing what a clock it was myself , therefore I desired her to tell me . But missing my Things at Jones 's Bagnio as soon as I wak 'd , I complained that I had been robbed , but I can say nothing to the Prisoner ; I met a Woman who carry 'd me thither , - but I ca n't say it was the Prisoner ; Indeed she acknowledg 'd when she was before Colonel De Veil , that she was the Woman who was with me that very Morning , - at Hyat 's Jersey Coffee House , first , - and then at the Turk's-Head Bagnio , but at the same time that she owned this , she denied the Fact , and said she did not rob me . Prisoner . Was no other Woman with you that Night ? Moone . I do n't know of any other Woman being there . Prisoner . I never saw his Things , or touched them , These People that appear against me , have but very indifferent Characters themselves . William Horrabin . ( A. Waiter at Jones 's Bagnio ) The Prisoner calls herself Ann Barton , alias Webb . She came in with the Prosecutor about the 30th of June , at the Turk's-Head Bagnio , between three and four o'Clock in the Morning . They asked for a Room ; I showe 'd them one ; and shewing them the Room , they called for a Negus . I served them with it , and then came down Stairs , and left them . In half a Quarter of an Hour the Bell rang , as I thought ; so I ran up Stairs , and laid hold of the Knob of the Door , but I could not open it : so I call 'd to Moone , and asked him if he rang ? No , G - d d - your B - d , go about your Business . Then I went down again , and carried a Bottle of Wine into the Bagnio ; and about an Hour after this , I heard the Bell ring hard : upon which I ran up Stairs , and found the Door of the Room , where the Prosecutor was , open . Sir , d 'ye call ? says I . Where 's the Woman that was with me , said he ? I told him I could not tell ; for he had lock 'd the Door , and I could not tell what was become of her . But why do you ask , Sir ? Why , ( says he ) she has robb 'd me of my Gold Watch , a Silver Snuff-box , and a Silver Tooth-pick Case , and immediately he fell a stamping about the Room . - Hush ! Hush ! said I , sometimes Women go out upon necessary Occasions ; and I went to the Vault to look for her , but she was not there . Then I came up Stairs again , and bid him be patient ; and I hunted about the Room , and about the Bed ; but I found only a few Keys , a Corkscrew , and a Bit of Sealing-wax . Why this is not my Watch , says he : No , ( I told him ) it was not , but he might have had 20 Watches , for ought I knew . - The Prisoner was the Woman who was with him at our Bagnio , and that 's all I know of the Matter . Francis Jean . A young Fellow brought me a Warrant , to serve upon the Prisoner , and desired me to go with him to the Crown-Tavern upon Ludgate-Hill . When I came there , there was Mrs Hyat and two Men ; one of whom carried me to Sword and Buckler Alley , where I took the Prisoner , and brought her to the Crown-Tavern . We sat a little while , and then Mrs Hyat went and fetched her Husband ; and we set out , in Order to go before a Justice . Mr Hyat and the Prisoner talked together , and he desired she would clear him , and tell whether the Watch was lost at his House , or not . She said , the Prosecutor did not lose it there , but that she took it out of his Pocket , on the Side of the Bed , at the Turk's-Head Bagnio , and had sold the Watch , and the outside Case , at two different Times , for 6 Guineas , to one George Stacey , or Stracey , I ca n't tell which . Prisoner . Ask him if John Hyat did not give him two Halfcrowns to swear against me ? Jean . Upon my Oath I never had a Halfpenny , nor the Promise of a Halfpenny . Prisoner . Mr Hyat wrote a great deal upon a Piece of Paper , and wanted me to sign it , but I told him I could neither read nor write , and I refused to do it . Then he told me if I could raise five or six Guineas , he would make it up . Jean . When the Prisoner was before the Lord-Mayor , she deny 'd the Fact , but she had confessed it to me and Mr Hyat * , as we were coming up Cheapside . Before we went to the Lord-Mayor 's , we call 'd at Sir William Biller 's , to see if Sir William was in the Way ; and at his Office she confessed she took the Things at the Bagnio . This was the 18th of July , in the Afternoon . I believe there was another Person heard her confess , beside Mr Hyat , but I am not certain of that , - upon my Honour I am not . * Mr Hyat was in Court , but neither the Prosecutor nor Prisoner cared to have him examined . Prisoner . Did not I deny it , before Colonel De Veil ? Jean . My Lord Mayor desired the Prisoner might be taken before Colonel De Veil , as she was taken with his Warrant , and we accordingly carried her before him . She did deny it there , but I told the Colonel , what she had confessed to me at the Office , and as we brought her up Cheapside . For Mr Hyat had bid her confess , in an honest way , that he might get clear of the thing ; upon which she fell a crying , and said , she did not know what to do . I am afraid ( says she ) I shall bring myself into trouble : but after she had wiped her Eyes , she said she would make a true Confession , and she accordingly confessed what I have related .

Edward Watson . I keep a Publick House in the Old Bailey ; but by Trade I am a Carver . I lost the Skirt of a Child 's flower 'd Damask Coat , worth 6 s. a Pair of double channel 'd Pumps , worth 4 s. The Skirt was my Neice 's ( a Child 's ) but I keep it : and I lost likewise 5 Guineas and some Silver . The Money was taken out of my Drawers ; the Pumps were taken from under the Bed-side . The Child 's Coat was taken away a Fortnight before the Money , and I missed that and the Pumps before I missed the Money - I found the Gold gone on the 12th of May . The Prisoner was a Servant out of Place , and was only at my House 'till she could get a Service ; I did not suspect the Prisoner at first , because there was another Servant in the House : but on the Day the Money was missing , the Prisoner went away , and I never saw her till 6 or 7 Weeks after . This gave me Reason to suspect her ; and a Gentlewoman bringing me word , that she had seen the Skirt of the Child 's Coat hang out at a Shop-Window in Field-Lane , I sent my Sister to see if she could get it ; that we might come at the Thief : She went and demanded it , and Mr Jakewell ; ( the Gentlewoman 's Husband who had bought it ) brought it home . This is my Skirt ; and this is the Gentlewoman who bought it . When the Prisoner was taken , she owned taking this and the Pumps ; and acknowledged that she took 3 or 4 Guineas out of the Drawer , and some Silver , but how much I can not tell .

She said she sold it for her Mother , who lived at St Giles 's , and was poor , and necessitated for want of Bread ; and that it belonged to her Sister , who was dead . As soon as I had bought it , I hung it up at the Door , and so they heard of it , and came and owned it .

Thomas Murdock . On the 15th of July I was coming out of the City , and had a Bag in my Hand , with 2 lb . 12 Ounces of Human Hair , and a Comb , and a Pair of Scissars in it . I walked up towards Bloomsbury , and not being well in Health , I sat down upon a Bench , by a Door , and two Men came and sat down by me . I had not been sat down long , before I fell fast a-sleep ; then a Woman , ( I suppose the Prisoner is the Person ) came , and took hold of me , and said , - 'wake , for your Wife has been seeking for you this Half Hour . I got up , but being drowsy , I sat down again , and did not mind her . Well , ( says the Woman ) if you wo n't 'wake , I 'll take your Bag , and will carry it away . And so she did , for she took it from me , and carried it quite off . I do n't know what Woman it was : I suppose it was the Prisoner . John Giffard . While this Gentleman ( the next Witness ) and I were sitting on the Bench , by the Door of the House where we lodge , the Prosecutor came up , and sat down on the Bench a little disordered , and fell asleep . He sat about a Quarter of an Hour , and then a Woman ( whom I take to be the Prisoner ) came and took hold of him by the Arm , and said , - Will you go Home ? This she repeated two or three Times over . Then she shook him again , and he got up . Your Wife and I , says she , have been seeking you this Half-Hour . I asked her if she knew the Gentleman ? Yes , yes , ( said she ) I lodge in the same House with him ; and she shook him again ; and he got up upon the Steps , but soon sat himself down again . Well then , says the Woman , if you wo n't go Home , I 'll take care of your Bag , and your Stick , and I 'll go Home and call your Wife to fetch you . And she did take the Bag and Stick out of his Hand , and went away with them ; but I ca n't say positively the Prisoner is the Woman . Thomas Wilson . I saw a Woman come up to the Prosecutor as he sat upon the Bench , and she asked him where he had been all this while ? Telling him his Wife and she had been to look for him . Upon this he 'wak 'd and got up , but soon sat himself down again : Upon this she told him , if he would not 'wake , she 'd take his Bag and Stick , and would fetch his Wife to him . But who the Woman was I ca n't tell , for it was Night . Joseph Thomlinson . One Morning as I was standing at my Door , about 6 in the Morning , 2 Men came to me , with a Parcel of Hair in a Silk Handkerchief , and asked me to buy it . I told them I should not buy any ; then they asked me if I knew any Hair-Merchants who would buy it ? I told them I did , and they wanted me to go along with them to one . I appointed them to come again at 11 o'Clock , and promised to go with them then , to a Hair-Merchant . Upon this they went away , but in half an Hour they returned , and said , they could not wait so long . I then asked them , how they came by the Hair ? They told me , they had it of a Hair-Merchant ( who lived in the House with them ) for a Debt . I could not go with them , before 11 o'Clock , and so they agreed to wait till that Time . Then I carry 'd them to one Mr Peterson ; he would not buy it himself , but recommended us to Mr Abery . We went to him , and he did not seem fond of buying it . They told him the same Story , they told me ; and he asked me if I knew the Men . I told him I did ; and that I believed there would be no Danger . Mr Abery then asked the Men the Value of the Hair . They said , they did not know , and hop 'd he would give them a Market-Price for it . He offered them 18 s. for it , which they took , and they would have given me 2 s. for my Trouble , but I would not take any thing . A little Time afterwards , I heard the Hair was advertised , and upon my saying I knew who sold it , the Prosecutor was sent to me , and I carried him to Mr Abery , who had bought it , and he told the Prosecutor he should have it again , or any Hair he had by him , which he thought would make him satisfaction . I knew nothing of the Prisoner ; but the Prosecutor gave the same Account of his losing them as he has done now . A Witness . When the Woman was before Sir Edward Hill , she said she found the Hair .

I went into the Three Cups Inn , in St John Street , the 24th of July at Night , for a Pint of Beer ; where I found the Prisoner ( a Soldier ) talking to the Landlord 's Sister about his Quarters . I desired him to be civil , and he was angry with we ; and asked me , who I was ? I told him I was a Parish Officer , and Words arising between us , he pulled out his Watch , and wanted to lay me a Wager , on account of his Quarters , and calling me Scrub , he said I had not Half-a-Guinea to lay with him . This made me be so indiscreet as to pull out a Bag , in which was two 3 l. 12 s. pieces , 2 Moidores , and 2 Half-Guineas , that I might shew the Prisoner I could lay him Half-a-Guinea if I pleased . After some Words had passed , I put up my Bag ; and in a very little Time afterwards the Landlord called me , and asked me , if I knew what Money I had in it ? I told him I did ; and upon looking it over , I found Half-a-Guinea missing . I can only say I lost it , and that the Prisoner was very much in Liquor . - Abery . I saw Half-a-Guinea lying upon the Table , where they had been disputing : and the Soldier took it up , and put it under his Watch , which lay upon the Table likewise . Then ( says he ) I see you have no Mind to lay a Wager , and so he put them both into his Pocket . I was sure it was one of Mr Williams 's Half-guineas , for I saw it drop through his Fingers upon the Table . Prisoner . I was very full of Liquor when I came in that Evening , and my Landlord said , he hop 'd I would be in a better Humour than I was the Night before . I told him , I hop 'd I was not in an ill Humour then , and that I should not be so now . He insisted upon 2 Men 's lying in the Room with me . I insisted upon it , that they should not , and that began the Talk of a Wager between Mr Williams and me . He told me , if I layed a Wager of a Guinea I should lose ; I said I have not a Guinea to bett , but I have what 's as good as a Guinea , or two either ; so I took out my Watch , and clapp 'd it down on the Table , - by the same Token , I broke the main Spring of it at the same Time . I own I had the Half-Guinea , but I do n't know how I came by it . They did not know that I had it , till I confessed it myself . I was so much in Liquor that Night , that though they carried me to New-Prison , I did not know where I was till next Morning . Mr Williams . He owned he had it the next Morning , but said , he did not know he had it , and he was very ready to give it me again . The Corporal and Serjeant of the Company to which the Prisoner belonged , gave him the Character of an honest Fellow . Acquitted . 380 . + George White , of Stepney , was indicted for assaulting William Martin on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 2 s. and 6 d. in Money , July 10 . Mr Martin . On Thursday the 10th of July , between the Hours of 2 and 3 in the Afternoon , in going from Bonner's-Hall to Old-Ford , I was attacked in the Parish of Stepney , by the Prisoner at the Bar . I was in my Chaise , by myself , in the Highway , - the Road that leads from Bethnal-Green to Old Ford . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man : He was on Foot , and crossing the Way suddenly , he catch 'd hold of the Horse 's Reins , and presenting a Pistol , he demanded my Money . I drove the Horse myself , and being alone , I was somewhat startled at such an unexpected Visit , at that Time of the Day ; and I had some Things of Value about me , which I forgot in a Hurry of Business to leave behind me . However , observing some People at a Distance , at Work in a Pea-field , and imagining he had not seen them , ( for I believe they were about 40 or 50 Yards off , ) I thought proper to acquaint him with it , in Hopes of deterring him from prosecuting his Design , or else that I might watch an Opportunity to jump out of the Chaise , and defend myself . So I stood up in the Chaise , and asked him how he could be so impudent as to rob me , in sight of so many People ? And I held out my Hand at the same Time , hoping they would come to my Assistance ; but being disappointed of that , as he kept his Pistol at my Head , and as my Life was at his Mercy , I thought the safest Way was to sit down , and in some Measure to comply with his Demand . Therefore putting my Hand into my Pocket , I pull 'd out some Money and gave him , which I afterwards found , a Halfcrown and a Halfpenny : for my Glove being on , I could not get my Hand to the Bottom of my Pocket , and I did not care to pull it off , lest I should discover a Mourning-Ring of more Value . But instead of asking me for more Money , he immediately demanded my Watch , which I had been so careful of concealing , that I imagined he had not seen it ; for I had tuck 'd the Chain into my Pocket , and endeavoured to hide it : therefore , not imagining he had seen it , I deny 'd that I had one . He still insisted upon it that I had one , and upon my finding that I could not escape without being plundered , I resolved to attempt jumping out of the Chaise ; but before I could compleat my Design , he left the Horse 's Head where he stood , and crouching under the Horse 's Head , he advanced nearer to me , and altered the Position of his Hand as he advanced : and at last ( with the utmost Cruelty ) he snapp 'd his Pistol at me . It happened , that it only flashed in the Pan ; and when I saw that , I jump 'd out of the Chaise immediately , on the same Side the Prisoner stood . He ran away ; I ran after him with my Whip in my Hand ; and when I had pursued him about 30 Yards , he turned and presented his Pistol at me , with the same Menaces as before . I was not certain what Number of Pistols he might have about him , so seeing a Brickbat , I stooped down and catched it up to defend myself ; and as he stood , I flung it at him , and very narrowly missed him . Upon this , he immediately turned Tail again , and I made after him . Now I was satisfy 'd he had no more Pistols about him ; so I kept shouting out , - Now I have you ! - You have no more Pistols ! He , upon this , made up to a Field , and I briskly made up to him , and finding he began to give out , I struck him with the But-end of my Whip , on the hind-part of his Head , and repeated my Blows , which made him turn about again upon me . But some how or other I lam 'd his Right-hand with a Blow ; and then I flew at him , and wrenched the Pistol out of his Hand , upon which he immediately cried out - he would surrender . This is the Pistol I took from him ; the Bullet is in it , - but the Flint is taken out , and the Touch-hole is plugg 'd up . By this Time a Person on Horseback , who was in the Field where I saw other Men at Work , came up to me , and he went with me to Bethnal-Green ; but being informed the Gentlemen in the Commission were gone to Hackney , we carry 'd the Prisoner before Mr Justice Selman , at Old-Ford , who was so kind as to take his Examination and Confession , which is now in Court . Samuel Sadler . I am Clerk to Mr Selman ; but I was not present at the Time he took this Examination . Mr Martin will prove the Prisoner 's signing it , and I will prove Mr Selman 's Hand . Mr Martin . I heard it read over to him , and saw him sign it . I think , - and to the best of my Remembrance , - I saw Mr Selman sign it , but I can not positively charge my Memory with that . Mr Sadler proved Mr Justice Selman 's Hand . The Prisoner 's Examination was read ; which was to the following Purport. `` The Examination of George White , taken this `` 10th Day of July 1740. `` Who being charged by William Martin , of `` Shadwell , Surgeon , with stopping him on the `` Road , leading from Bethnal Green to Old-Ford , `` and taking from him two Shillings and Six-pence `` Halfpenny ; confesseth , that he stopped him , `` and took the above-mentioned Sum from him , `` and that he voluntarily subscribeth this Confession . '' Prisoner . I resign myself up to your Lordship 's Honour and Pleasure ; and as it was through Poverty I did it , I hope for Transportation . Mr Martin . There was a Gentleman so unfortunate , as to be shot into the Face , with 2 Sluggs , but a few Days before , by this very Man . Guilty , Death . 381 . + Peter Courtrie , otherwise Courbee , of St Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a Half-pint Silver Mug , value 50 s. a Silver Salt , value 10 s. and a Pair of Silver Tea-tongs , value 4 s. the Goods of Thomas Crawford , in his Dwelling-house , August 26 . [ An Interpreter was sworn between the Court and the Prisoner . ] Thomas Crawford . I am a Vintner , and live in Great Queen-street , near Lincoln's-Inn-Fields . On Tuesday the 26th of August last , about five o'clock in the Afternoon , I lost out of my Fore-parlour a Silver half-pint Mug , - worth about 30 s or more . A Silver Salt , worth about 10 s. and a Pair of Silver Tea-tongs , worth 4 s. at least , for they cost me 18 . They were all mine ; I saw them that Tuesday Morning , but did not miss them till the Thursday following . Now I recollect my self , I remember I saw them when I was going to Dinner on Tuesday , and we have never seen them since The Prisoner came to my House under pretence of taking it ready furnished for the Swedish Ambassador . He was twice at the House on the Monday before for this Purpose ; and he came again on Tuesday , and brought a Letter with him sealed up , pretending it came from the Envoy of Sweden 's Lady , and that it contained an Agreement for the House at four Guineas a Week ; that she was so well pleased with the Description he had given of the House , that she would be content to pay that Money for it . I saw the Prisoner deliver the Letter to my Wife , - but I do n't understand French , though she does . Mrs Crawford . This Letter the Prisoner brought to me . I have had it in my Pocket ever since , except some Times , when I have had it in my Hands . It is wrote in French , and it is sign 'd - Mary , Baron De Courtrie . The Letter was read in French , and afterwards was interpreted as follows. `` Madam , `` I do myself the Honour to write to `` you , as I am just setting out for the Country , `` with Madam the Ambassadress , who desires absolutely `` that I stay 7 or 8 Days with her in the `` Country . As the young Man , the Bearer of `` this has given me a particular Account of your `` House , I am extremely pleased with it ; particularly `` with knowing the Gentlewoman speaks `` French . Therefore I desire you to keep it a `` Week longer , and the Day before we come out `` out of the Country will give you notice of it. `` As to the Price , I make none with you , knowing `` the Baron De Courtrie has been directed to `` your House , by one of your Friends . I there-fore `` desire you to give the Room of the Second `` Floor of your House , to the Bearer of this . He `` is a young Man , who has been recommended to `` the Ambassador , who is just set out for Portugal , `` and is to come in a Month with his Son , and `` who is to be at London with him . For that reason , `` I desire you to let him have a Bed , till his `` Return from the Country , and I shall be obliged `` to you ; In the mean time I am , `` Madam , `` Your Humble Servant , `` Mary Baron De Courtrie . Directed , `` To the Lady of the House `` At London . Mr Crawford . I ca n't say I saw the Prisoner take the Plate , for I was not at home when he came the last time , and when we suppose he took it . But missing it , we advertised it , with a Description of the Prisoner ; and on Saturday Morning about 11 , Mr Benn , who keeps a Shop under St Dunstan 's Church , in Fleet-Street , came to me , and informed me , that he believed from the Description I had put in the Daily-Advertiser , That the Person who had robbed me , had brought a Silver Spoon to sell at Mr Deard 's Shop ; but Mr Deard 's Young Man being ill , he sent him to Mr Wild 's Shop , and offered it there , with Medals and French Coin . Mr Wild not being in the Shop , his Wife she sent for Mr Benn , the Watch-maker , at next Door , and while they were looking at the Things , Mr Wild himself came in , and observing a Crest upon the Spoon , he stopped both That , and the Prisoner . They suspected it to be the Lord Darby 's Crest , and while they went with the Prisoner to Lord Darby , Mr Benn came to me , and upon the Information he gave me , I went with him , and overtook the Prisoner in Burlington-Gardens . As soon as I saw the Prisoner , I said , - By G - , that 's the Fellow : upon which he turned about , and took to his Heels ; I ran after him as far as May-Fair , and there he was taken : but I found nothing upon him , nor did he confess any thing to me ; only he down 'd on his Knees and begged Pardon ; but 't was in French , and I did not understand it . I charged him with taking my Plate , because there had been nobody in the Room from the Time I saw it , to the Time of my missing it ; but He , my Wife , and my own Family . Prisoner . Do you know me ? Mr Crawford . As well as I know my own Right-Hand . Prisoner . I leave it to the Judgment of the Court . Mrs Crawford . I was out of Town on Monday , but a Gentlewoman who lives with me dispatched a Messenger to let me know , that a Person had been there about taking our House , and that I must be at home about 12 o'clock , for he was then to come again and bring the Person with him , who was to have the House . I was very well pleased , and I am sure I was not 3 Quarters of an Hour in walking from Chelsea to Queen-Street . I got home a little past 12 , and finding the Gentleman had not been there , I said , I hoped I should not loose my Labour , I waited ( very impatient for his coming ) till between 1 and 2 , and nobody came . At last , as I sat in my Fore-parlour , I saw the Prisoner coming along , in a dark Suit of Cloaths , Silk Breeches , and a little dirty short Wig . O says I , to the Gentlewoman who was with me , - there 's a Foreigner ! He presently knocked at the door , and came in and said , - Madam , you give me Account of the House , and the Price . I desired him to walk in , and shew me what he wanted . He did so , and desired my Name , and Directions to the House , for the Secretary belonging to the Envoy . I called to my Husband , and desired him to set down our Name , and how many Doors up the Street our House was , that he might carry these Particulars with him . He said the Envoy was hurried out of Town , with the French Ambassador , and I took it for granted , that as soon as he returned , I should have advice of it ; so he went away telling me , This Envoy was recommended to us , by a Person of my Acquaintance . I said , I wonder 'd who it should be : He told me , I should know when the Envoy came , and so we parted . But on Tuesday about 11 or 12 , he came again ; My Husband was at home , and I was in the Fore-Parlour . As soon as he came in , he gave me this Letter ; I opened it , and desired the Prisoner to read it , for , says I , I do n't know whether I could read it , or no . He said , he wonder 'd I could not read it , when I spoke so good French ; so he took it , and says he , - Women do n't understand Orthograph , ( Orthography ) and he read the Letter very perfect . I was transported to think I should have a Foreign Minister for four Years in my House , and said to my Husband , - My Dear , we are very lucky to let our House to such a Person . Aye says he , 't is very well , if they pay us . O , says I , Publick Ministers never do otherwise ; and then speaking to the Prisoner , - Sir , says I , by the Contents of the Letter , you are to lie here to-night . Yes , Madam , says he . There , ( says I to my Husband , ) there 's satisfaction enough , and therefore take down the Bill . I asked the Prisoner to stay and dine with us upon a Shoulder of Mutton : He said no , and went away ; and I was in Raptures , and was wished Joy , on this Account . About 5 o'clock , as I was ironing some little Things in my Kitchen , somebody knocked at the Door . A Gentlewoman , looked out of the Area , and said , - there was Monsieur come again . As soon as he came in , he went up Stairs , and the Gentlewoman went up with him ? I called to her , and bid her desire him to come down ; for when he went away the Time before , he said , he would go and fetch the Baggage , and would come and lie there ; so I thought he was no better than a Valet de Chambre . Upon her desiring him to come down , he did so in an instant , and said to me , - Madam , the reason of my coming is , that I find you have a House in the Country , and perhaps it may not suit with your Conveniency , to let me lie here to-night . I told him , I always had somebody or other in the House , and it would be no Inconveniency to me at all : Nay , in case His Excellency himself had a mind to come to-night , it would not put me to a Nonplus ; - for I was to have found Linnen , Plate , China , - Plate , he said the Baron had of his own ; and as to the rest of the Things , as soon as ever the Baron came to be settled , he would buy them all himself . Thus he stood chatting , while I was ironing : and my Son , ( who lives with an Attorney , having 2 or 3 Hours to spare , ) happened to come in , and upon his seeing the Letter lie upon the Table , I told him how lucky we had been , and desired him to read it . Is that your Son , says the Prisoner ? And can he read the Letter ? Yes , Sir , says I , but not so well as you , for he does not fancy his French , though he has been at Paris . Among other Things , I asked him what Religion the Ambassador was of ? He said , He had changed his Religion , and was now a Protestant ; that he was about Forty Years old , and that his Lady was a very agreeable Woman . I told him I had a House in the Country , and should be very glad , if she would come and take an airing with me . After this , he asked me , if I had ever a French Book ? I told him I had , but Mr Crawford had locked most of them up , however ( as we were all busy , it being Execution-Day ) I said to him , if he would go into such a Back-closet , he would find some . He had before seen the House , all over , so he goes up , and came down again presently with a Book in his Hand ; - O Madam , says he , here is very good Book ; it treat about the Romans . Sir , says I , if it is worth your Acceptance , 't is at your Service ; and I intended to offer him a Pair of Gloves when my Lodgers came , but he whipp 'd up Stairs again , and came down and ask 'd for a little Water . Jenny , says I , ( to the Maid ) your Master will want a little Punch at Night , go and get a little Pump-Water , and give the Gentleman some . He said no , He would no give the Trouble ; but I bid her go . After this , says he , - Madam I will go up , and sit in the Closet by the Garden . O Sir , says I , the Garden is a very poor Place ; you had better sit in the Fore-Parlour * - that will divert you . Accordingly he went there , and staid a little Time ; Then he came down again into the Kitchen , and asked what o'clock it was . I told him , I had sent my Clock into the Country , and my Watch did not go . My Son told him 't was almost 6 o'clock ; then he said he would go to a House , where there was a Half-crown and a Twelve-penny Ordinary , the Sign of the King's-Arms , ( he thought ) but he did not know the name of the Street ; but he would return that Night ; - he would not keep us up late , - and he desired to take the Book with him . At half an Hour after 10 , I went to Bed , and left my Husband up , playing at Picquet with a Gentlewoman ; when he came to Bed he told me , my Lodger was not come ; nor did he ever come afterwards . The Things mentioned in the Indictment were safe that Day about 2 o'clock , and were in a Place in the Fore-Parlour , which Place was locked , but the Key was left in the Door . I have never seen any of them since , nor have I any Prospect of ever seeing them again . That same Night , after the Prisoner was gone , I locked up the Place from whence the Plate was taken , and seeing other Things stand in Front , as they had done , I had no manner of Mistrust that any thing was gone ; and to my Knowledge 't was never unlocked again , till the Thursday , when we missed them ; and then my Husband he went to enquire after the Baron Courtrie , and not finding any such Person , he advertised the Things . Acquitted . * The Place from whence the Plate was taken . He was a second Time indicted for stealing a cambrick Handkerchief , value 6 s. a Gold Ring , with a cornelian Stone set therein , value 10 s. and 1 ditto with a Bristol-stone set therein , value 10 s . the Goods of Morgan Mityard , in the Parish of St George Hanover-square , August 25 . Ann Mityard . I am Wife of Morgan Mityard ; he does not live with me , nor has he been with me these three Years . We are parted ; but it is only by our own Consent : no Act of Separation , nor any Divorce has passed between us . I live with Mr Hayes and Mr. Graham , Apothecaries , in Conduit-street , near Hanover-square ; and on the 25th of August , I lost out of my Master 's Kitchen a cambrick Handkerchief , worth 6 s. and these two Rings which I have upon my Finger ; one has a Cornelian Stone with three small ones on each Side , the other hath a Bristol-stone , with three little ones in the same Manner . I value them at 10 s. a-piece . The Prisoner came to my Master 's House , to take Lodgings for an Ambassador 's Secretary . I asked him the Ambassador 's Name , but he told me , I could not understand him . I missed the Things in a Quarter of an Hour after he was gone , and I am sure he is the Man . He was but once at our House , and that was on Monday the 25th of August , and he was taken the Saturday following , near Dover-street . I was not present when he was taken , but I was with him at the Alehouse , before he was carried to Sir Edward Hill . I had the Rings from Jacob Harris , a Silversmith , at Clement's-Inn , and I am sure they are mine . Prisoner . Ask her if she knows me ? And if she saw me take them ? Mityard . I know him ; but I did not see him take the Things . He was down in our Kitchen , and I had pulled off my Rings , and had laid them at the Corner of the Pewter-shelf . He was in the Kitchen near three Quarters of an Hour , and desired me to shew him the Closet , and the Pantry . I did so ; and I let him see my Master 's Plate . He asked me if any Mistress belonged to the House . I told him no ; then you ( says he ) are the only Mistress . - He talked English to me at that Time . Joseph Tipton . These are the very Rings my Mistress bought . - Her Name is Martha Harris . Her Husband keeps the Shop , but he was not at Home when the Prisoner brought them to sell , so she bought them of the Prisoner , last Tuesday was a Se'en-night , about five o'clock in the Evening , and gave him 4 s. for the Two . I shew 'd them to my Master next Morning , and he said he would not have given above Half-a-Crown for them , for they were of no more Value to him , than the Gold was worth . My Mistress did not ask him any Questions when she bought them , for he appeared very well dressed then , and spoke English . I am sure he is the Man . Prisoner . He does not know me , nor do I know him . Guilty 4 s. + . + There was another Indictment against him for a Felony of the same Nature , which therefore was not tryed . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 282. Elizabeth Gold was indicted for stealing a Pair of linnen Sheets , value 10 s. the Goods of Thomas Ashleforth , in the Prisoner 's Lodging . July 8 . Acquitted . 283 . + Elizabeth Fisher , of St Luke 's Middlesex , was indicted for stealing a strip 'd Sattin Gown , value 30 s. a cotton Gown , value 12 s. a linnen Gown , value 10 s. a camblet Gown , value 13 s. a Gold Ring , val 7 s . a Silver Tea-spoon , val . 1 s. 2 dimitty Petticoats , value 2 s. and a woollen Petticoat , val . 12 d. the Goods of William Walsham , in his Dwelling-house , Aug. 17 . And 284 . 285. George Holden , and Rebecca his Wife , and Rebecca his Wife , were indicted for receiving the same , knowing them to be stole , August 17 . William Walsham . I live in Whitecross-street , and am a Butcher . I lost on the 17th of August last , all the Things mentioned in the Indictment out of my Dining-Room , up one Pair of Stairs . I saw them in the Room on Saturday Night ; they were all stole at once , on the Sabbath-day , but I did not miss them till Monday . The 4 Gowns were worth about 40 s. or 3 l. the Ring 7 s. the Tea-spoon 1 s. or 2 , and-the three Petticoats were worth about 4 s. I would not over-rate them . I did not suspect the Prisoner ( Fisher ) till she was taken up and put in Newgate . Then I went to her , and she confessed she took all the Things , and that Holden and his Wife received them . I did not know her , for I never saw her in my Life , before that Time ; but upon my asking her if she knew any Thing of the Goods I had lost , she told me , that Mrs Holden shewed her our Back-door , and told her , if she could get up Stairs , she would find something of Value . That she accordingly went up , and put the Things into her Apron , while Mrs Holden waited for her at the End of Whitecross-street , and when the Prisoner came to her with the Things , she ( Holden ) took them from her , and carry 'd them to her Room . All the Gowns and Petticoats I had again ; I found them at the Places Fisher directed me to . The strip 'd silk Gown I found in Holden 's House ; two others in Chick-Lane , at one Fountaine 's , who sells old Cloaths . The other I found at Pinchbeck 's , in Field-Lane . One Petticoat was sold to a Woman in the Rope-walk , who let me have it again ; another to one Howard , in Golden-Lane ; and the third Petticoat I found at Holden 's House , between the Bed and the Sacking , where he and his Wife lay ; I found the Silk Gown and the Petticoat in their House , with a Sheet and a Table-cloth , which are not in the Indictment . And these Things I found in the Presence of Holden and his Wife . The Tea-spoon I found at one Stevenson 's , ( who goes by the Name of Penn ) in Golden-Lane ; and the Ring was sold at a Silversmith 's in Newgate-street , but she ( Fisher ) could not tell which was the Shop . Rebecca Holden . I ask him where he found the Gown ? Walsham . The Gown hung up in a Sort of a Press : it was not concealed , but the Petticoat was hid , between the Bottom of the Bed and the Sacking . Holden . Did I refuse to let you search ? Walsham . They could not ; I had a Search-Warrant . Lawrence Fowler confirmed Mr Walsham 's Account , of the Prisoner Fisher 's Confession , and of the finding the Goods in the Manner he related . He added , that when the Holdens were before Mr Justice Wroth , they said , they bought the Gown , which was found in their Room , of the Prisoner Fisher , for a Crown ; and the Petticoat ( found under the Bed ) she left there , to be made less in the Waist ; and that they took her ( when she brought these Things to them ) to be a Dealer in Rag-Fair . Mrs De La Fountaine . I bought 2 Gowns of an elderly Woman and a Girl , last Monday was a Fort night ; the Girl at the Bar brought them , and the Woman ( Holden ) was with her . I gave 8 s. for one , and 4 for the other . The Constable has got them , but he is not here . Mr Walsham . I saw them hang up at this Witness 's Door , and I swear they are mine . De La Fountaine . I tender 'd the Money for one of them to the Old Woman ; and I think the Girl ( Fisher ) took the Money for the other . I asked Holden how she came by the Things ? She said , she was under Misfortunes , and that she was sorry to part with her Cloaths ; but she must part with them , she said , to pay her Debts . Holden had a Child in her Arms , as she has now ; and Fisher told me the Child was her Brother , and that Holden was her Mother ; and upon their Complaints , I gave them 2 Shillings more for one of the Gowns , than it was worth . I have never seen either of them since , nor have I had any Discourse with them . Rebecca Holden . Did I come into the Shop , before you had bargained with the Girl , and had sent out for Change . De La Fountaine . She came in , while the Change was sent for : Fisher , the Girl , came in and bargained for the Things ? Holden was at the Door , and upon her telling me 't was her Mother , I bid her come in , and the 8 s. for one of the Gowns , I tender 'd down to her in Shillings , all in a Row ; and she took them up . Mary Pinchbeck . The young Prisoner ( Fisher ) brought me a strip 'd Holland Gown , and the old Woman was her . I bid her 7 s. for it , but she went away , and would not take it . In an Hour 's Time they came back , and would take the Money . Fisher said it was her own Gown , and I told her she was a nasty Slut to wear such a Gown , and draggle it so . She told me , she could not help it ; she bought it , and it was too long for her , and now she was obliged to sell it , because her Husband was in Woodstreet-Counter . The old Woman was all the Time at the Door , and did not say any Thing at all . Margaret Franlin . I saw the Gown and Petticoat taken out of Holden 's Room , as hath been related . Rebecca Holden said , that Fisher lodged in the House , but not in that Room where the Things were found : she own 'd Fisher brought them in , but thought ( as she said ) that she had brought them from her Washerwoman 's . Fisher the Girl . I lodg 'd in these People 's House ; she said to me that Sunday Morning , - Betty , you owe me a small Matter of Money , I will give you a Dram or 2 , and will shew you where you may get something . So she carried me to Mr. Walsham 's Back-door , and I went up , and took the Things ; she waited for me , and took them out of my Apron into her own , and went with me to sell 'em . Rebecca Holden . No ; I was in my own Room , and she called me down Stairs , when she brought them into my House . George Holden , I know nothing of the matter ; I keep a House in Robin-Hood's-Court , in Shoe-Lane , and take the Toll in Smithfield for that Gentleman , - Mr. Leigh . George Leigh . I know nothing of Rebecca Holden , and all I know of the Man is , that I have paid Toll to him , when I have bought or sold Cattle , in Smithfield . Ann Thomas . I have known the 2 Holdens 2 Years . I have liv 'd 3 Quarters in their House . I never knew any Harm of them . He is a Bailiff 's Follower ; and she does nothing , but look after her House . Alice Brown , and Thomas Brown never heard ill of the Holdens before . Rebecca Holden . Ask Mrs Brown , where I was , when the Girl brought the Cloaths in . Alice Brown . I live in Holden 's House , - up one pair of stairs . Mrs. Holden was up in my Room that Morning , and her Husband was in the Garden . The Girl came in and called her down stairs , and said she had fetched some Things from her Washerwoman 's . I came down stairs , and saw a new Cotton Gown , and said , - This Gown never came from the Washerwoman 's . She said it did , and borrowed a Shilling of Holden to pay for her washing . Rebecca Holden . Did not she say she would hang 20 People , before she would hang me , - I mean before she would hang herself . Brown . When the Constable came into the House , she said so . She goes by the Name of Fisher , but her right Name is Ballenger . Fisher * Guilty 39 s. Rebecca Holden Guilty . George Holden Acquitted . * There were two other Indictment against , but not try 'd .

RicHARD Welch was indicted for stealing a Silver Salver , val . 10 l. the Goods of Samuel Riley , in the Middle Temple , June 24 . Samuel Riley . I am Chief Butler to the Society of the Middle Temple ; I have been in this Office 12 Years ; but I have been Butler 20 Years in all . In Term-time , I have Part of the Plate in my Custody ; 't is delivered to me by Mr Brounker , the Treasurer , and I give him a Receipt for such Plate as he delivers into my Custody ; I likewise give a Bond of Security to the Society in general , for the faithful Execution of my Office ; and from time to time that 't is delivered to me , till I return it back to Mr Brounker , no one has any Authority to take it away . When I bring it for Use , into the Hall , as soon as 't is done with , I take it back again into my Custody , and have the sole Charge of it , and keep it in a Place appointed for that purpose , and which is under my Care . On the 24th of June last , which was in Trinity-Term , it was our Grand Day ; and this is the Plate which I lost that Day out of the Middle-Temple-Hall , about 5 o'clock in the Afternoon . This Salver is the Fellow to what we then lost ; - we have 4 of them in all . There 's the Temple Arms upon it , and I can swear 't is what I lost . I missed it about 5 o'clock , and had it in my Hand , about half an Hour before . I had it ( with other Plate ) in my Custody , from the Beginning of Easter-Term to that Time , and did not deliver it back for the short Vacation , between Easter and Trinity , so I kept it for the two Terms . This Receipt I signed for the Plate at the Time it bears date . It was read. `` April 21 , 1740 . Received all the Plate from Mr Brounker into my Custody , as mentioned Page 39 of this Book . '' I saw Page 39 several times , before I signed the Receipt , and this Piece of Plate among others is there mentioned , - 4 Salvers , with the Arms marked p T B . Those Letters stood for the Name of the Treasurer : Mr Broderick was Treasurer when this Plate was made . Some Time after it was lost , I heard by an Advertisement , that one Mr Urton , a Pawnbroker , had stopped a Piece of Plate ; I went to him , and found 2 Pieces in his Custody , ( which belonged to the Feet of the Salver ) the whole Bottom I found in the Prisoner 's Lodgings , up 2 pair of stairs , in Windmill street , where he was taken . He told me himself that he lodged there . We found the Door locked , and upon entring the Room and searching it , we discovered the Plate upon a Shelf over the Door ; it had been burnt in the Fire and bent back , almost quite double . The Pieces which we found at Mr Urton 's belong to it . Couns . What do you take the Plate to be worth ? Mr Riley . There is the Weight engraved on the Back of it , 42 Ounces 7 Penny-weights , therefore it must be worth above 10 l. I was with the Prisoner before the Justice , who took his Confession in Writing . Sir Edward Hill . I read his Confession to him , and he sign 'd it in my Presence . The Confession was taken by me , and acknowledged before me , the 14th Day of July , 1740. `` The Examination and voluntary Confession of `` Richard Welch , of St James 's Westminster , Labourer , `` taken before me this 14th Day of July , `` 1740. Who saith , That on or about the latter end `` of June last , he found means to get into the Middle-Temple-Hall , `` and seeing a Silver Salver stand `` upon a Shelf there , he took it away , and brought `` it to his own Apartment ; where he broke off `` the Feet , and otherwise defaced it ; and offering `` Part of the Feet to Mr Urton , a Pawnbroker , `` they were stopped by the said Urton , who advertising `` them , occasioned Him to be found out. `` This Examinant farther saith , That he makes `` this Confession voluntarily , and without any Menaces , `` and farther says not . Samuel Urton . The Prisoner brought only these Pieces of the Feet to me , on the 5th of July , - the Saturday before I advertised them in the Papers . He wanted to pledge them ; I taxed him hard , and he said they were his own ; but would not tell any Thing farther , for he told me that wa s enough . I had taken some of them 3 Days before ; these two Pieces with the Holes in them , I took the Thursday before ; for I knew the Prisoner , - I had known him 8 or 10 Years , but always very poor ; so I took these Pieces , and he told me , he had brought them from a Working Silversmith . But when he came with these small Bits on the Saturday following , I stopped him . I was present when the Prisoner 's Room was searched , and found the Bottom of the Salver upon the Shelf over the Door , in his Room . I take these Pieces to belong to it . The Counsel for the King to prove the Indictment properly laid , took notice , that as the Case stood , it was the best way , to lay the Goods as the Property of Mr Riley , who was Chief Butler of the Middle-Temple , and says the Plate is delivered into his Charge , and that he is answerable for it : that therefore he has a temporary Possession , and consequently a good Property . That this Case might be compared to that of a Carrier , to whose Care Goods are committed , which Goods are said to be the Carrier 's pro Tempore , because he has them for a Time , to bring them to the Place designed . That this was a similar Case ; Mr Riley having , pro Tempore , the same Possession , as appeared from his Evidence . That in the Case of a Taylor , - If Cloth be delivered to a Taylor , and a Felon steal it , and an Indictment against him be fram 'd , the Cloth may be said to be the Property of the Taylor . That in Pulton , de Pace , Fol . 70 . Sect . 18 . The Words are , If a Man deliver Cloth to a Taylor , and a Felon steal it , the Felon may be indicted for stealing the Goods of the Taylor . It was further urged , that if Goods are delivered to a Bailiff , and he is liable to return them , or is answerable for them , if the Person who owns them , or has the Property in them , comes privately , and takes them away , without the Knowledge of the Bailiff , it is Felony . Vid . Coke 's Institutes , Folio 110 . It was therefore hop 'd , that this was a proper Indictment , because Mr Riley had a special Property in the Goods , and a just Possession . The Court was of the same Opinion , and the Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 392 , 393.

William Jones . I am a Bookseller : my Dwelling-house is in Redcross-street , but I keep a little Shop in Holborn , at the Corner of Staple's-Inn , which was broke open the 19th of July , and I guess 'd that I had lost about 30 or 40 Books ; I imagined it would be too tedious to put them all in the Indictment , therefore I have mentioned but these six . [ The Titles of the Books were read , with Those set forth in the Indictment , and the Witness gave much the same Account of their Value . ] A Watchman found the Shop broke open , and sent to my Dwelling-house to inform me of it , between two and three in the Morning . The Prisoner Wilson was taken in the Shop . He gave an Account that Murray , the other Prisoner , had the Books , and they were found in a Chamber of Mr Ward 's , at No . 9 , in Furnival's-Inn . Several of them were delivered me by Mr Ward 's eldest Clerk , and these four were taken out of Murray 's Pocket ; I saw them taken out : he shewed them to me himself , and put them into the Beadle 's Hands . The Guardians were found in a Closet in Mr Ward 's Chambers ; Murray directed a Person to look for the Key of the Closet , and confessed that it was all along of Wilson . Wilson had confessed before I took Murray , that Murray and he broke open the Shop , and took out the Books . This he confessed to me , and likewise before my Lord-Mayor : He confessed he was in the Shop , and delivered out the Books to Murray ; so in the Evening we went to Murray , and found these Books upon him . Murray did not deny the Fact at first , but blamed Wilson , and Wilson blamed him ; but when Murray was before my Lord-Mayor he denied it , and said Wilson threw them all in ( unknown to him ) at a Window at Mr Ward 's Chambers . Prisoner Wilson . Did I make any Confession in writing ? Mr Jones . He went back to my Lord-Mayor 's , and had an Information wrote , to charge Murray ; and told me , I should have every Book again : I saw the Information , but I know nothing of his signing it . Murray . Is not this a large Shop of Books , from whence these were taken ? Mr Jones . No , it is a little Shop ; there is about 2 or 3 hundred Books in it ; all mark 'd with my Mark . These have my Mark in them , - an Alphabet Letter , - F , or M , or N. They are put in my Books , both to distinguish the Prices , and ascertain my Property ; and they are such Marks as are peculiar to myself . Murray . Have you no more of those Sort of Books in that Shop ? Mr Jones . I have no more Guardians but this Set , at that Place : I believe I had no more of any of these Sorts there . I am sure these are all my Books . I know them . Murray . What Mark was in the Guardians ? Jones . An Z and F. And there is an M in the Rights of Princes . Murray . When did you first hear of me ? Jones . Wilson gave me Information that he was concerned in the Robbery , and I took him at his Master 's Chambers . I ca n't tell whether he is a regular Clerk to Mr Ward or not ; the eldest Clerk when I was there , told me Mr Ward was out of Town . Charles Jones . I am Son of the former Witness . I shut up the Shop close on the 18th of July at Night , and went home ; but my Father and I were called up the next Morning about 3 o'clock . Richard Aspley , a Watchman , found the Shop broke ; and when we got to the Watch-house , we saw Wilson in Custody . Upon examining the Shop , I guessed there were about 30 Books gone , among which were all those my Father has mentioned . I saw them all there that Week , - I ca n't justly speak to the Time when ; but we can miss Books , by the Gaps upon the Shelves . Henry Robinson , ( a Watchman ) . Three Minutes before two in the Morning , the 19th of July , I went to the upper End of my Walk , that I might beat down again , when the Clock struck . When I was got just against this Shop , I heard a Clatter , - a falling down of something . I immediately went up , and knocked at the Shop door - Who is there , says I ? There was no Answer , - so I called out again , - Who is there ? A Man ( who we found afterwards was Wilson ) answer 'd , - It was his Brother 's Stall , and he came there to lie that Night . I bid him open the Door ; he would not , but kept it fast with his Lift Garter . I saw the Staple of the Padlock bent , and hanging upon the Door , so I thought it did not look well ; and a Brother-Watchman coming up to assist me , we forced the Door open , and laid hold of him . We did not find any Thing upon him , but the Books were pulled down , and lay ready upon the Stand to be carried off . When we took him , ( Wilson ) he said but little , only he desired us to use him as a Gentleman , for - he was no Scoundrel . But my Partner took him to the Watch-house , and I said to look after the Shop , so I heard him make no Confession . Murray . When you saw Wilson in the Shop , did you see any Body else about the Door ? Robinson . I saw nobody at all about the Door , after I heard the Noise . Aspley . I am the Watchman that Robinson called to his Assistance . As he went up to beat his Rounds , he lifted up his Lanthorn to the Door . I called and asked what was the Matter ? Here is somebody in the Shop , says he ! I ran over to him , and heard Wilson say , it was his Brother 's Shop , and he came there to sleep , and would sleep . I observed the Bar to be down , and that the Padlock hung upon the Staple ; so I whispered Harry Robinson , and told him , I would call another Watchman to take Care of him . When I was going to call another Man , then he was for coming out of the Shop ; - No , no , says I , as you have staid all this while , stay a little longer ; and when I had got another Watchman , we opened the Door , and told him , he must go to the Watch-house . He called us a Parcel of Scoundrels , and said he would go to his Brother 's at Furuival's-Inn . I told him he should go to the Watch-house , and as we carried him along he catch 'd hold of the Bar of a Window , and held so fast , that I was forced to give him a Knock on the Elbow to make him let go . Then we carried him to the Watch-house , and sent for Mr Jones , but we found nothing upon him . I was with him before my Lord-Mayor , where he would own nothing at all at first , but at last , he said Murray was concerned with him , in breaking open the Shop , and taking the Books . By his Information Murray was taken , and brought to us , who waited for him at Furnival's-Inn-Cellar ; and there he ( Murray ) delivered 4 Books out of his Pocket ; ( what they were I ca n't tell ) and he said the rest were in a particular Place , and told us where the Key lay , which was to open the Door of the Closet in his Master 's Chambers , where the Books were put . I heard Murray tell Mr Jones he should not lose one of his Books ; and that it was all along of Wilson that he came into the Scrape . These two Carpenter 's Tools I found standing upright against the Wall , within 2 or 3 Doors of the Shop which had been broke open , about an Hour after Wilson was taken . Murray . When I was sent for , did not I come willingly ? Aspley . Yes ; I believe he did . John York . I was there when Wilson laid hold of the Bar of the Window , and assisted in carrying him down to the Watch-house . I heard him say nothing about this Robbery ; but I heard Murray confess the Books were in the Chamber , and he said they were thrown thro ' the Window . They were found in a Bag , in a Closet in the Chambers at Furnival's-Inn . Thomas Sympson . I was Constable that Night , when the Watchmen brought Wilson , by Force , into the Watch-house . They told me he had broke open a Bookseller 's Shop joining to Staple's-Inn . He would not confess any thing at first ; but when he found I was going to send him to the Compter , he said , Mr Jones should have all his Books again . I sent him to the Compter that Night , and next Morning , carried him before my Lord-Mayor , where he denied having the Books ; but after my Lord had committed him to the Compter , he acknowledged that he took them out of the Shop , and delivered them to Murray , and said that Mur- ray took them away in 2 Pillow-cases . Wilson directed me where to find Murray , and accordingly I found him at Mr Ward 's Chambers , No . 9. in Furnival's-Inn . When I first went to the Chambers , he was not within ; but Mr Dowdell told me , he expected him in every Minute , so I went to Furnival's-Inn-Cellar , and sat a-while ; then I desired Mr Jones and his Son to go and see for him ; and they brought him down to us . I asked him , What he had done with the Books ? He pretended not to know what I meant . You do , says I , - your Companion has impeached , and has told us where the Books are . Upon this he sat down a little while , and then says he , - He 's a vile Rogue , he has drawn me into this Scrape ; but if Mr Jones will be easy , he shall not lose one of them . He did not own he took them , but said they were thrown in at the Window . Jury . How was the Shop-Door fastened ? William Jones . There 's an under , and an upper Door ; the under Door is fastened with 2 Bolts , and the upper Door was fastened with this Padlock , which was wrenched off . William Newton , John Richardson , Ambrose Clark , Patrick Brian , and Catherine Brian appeared to Wilson 's Character . Robert Duckworth , Lawrence Riggs , and Margaret Riggs spoke to Murray 's . Murray Acquitted . Wilson Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 394 . + Rachael North , of St Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , val . 3 l. from the Person of Samuel Ellington , August 21 . Samuel Ellington . On the 21st of August , I had been in the City about a little Business , and as I was coming home , between 11 and 12 at Night , the Prisoner met me , just by Kingsgate-street , in Holborn , and catch 'd me by my Right-hand , - How do you do , says she ? Pretty well , says I ; shall we buss , says she ? No ; get away , or I 'll lay my Stick over your Back . No ; you wo n't , says she , and immediately she clapped hold of the Chain of my Watch , drew it out , and ran away with it , as soon as she had got it . I felt it go at once . I pursued her about 20 Yards , or somewhat less , and caught hold of her ; which I had no sooner done , but 3 Fellows came from the other Side of the Way , and one of them struck me on the Forehead , with so much Violence , that it immediately swelled up as big as my Fist . They knock 'd me down , and beat my Hatt off . As soon as I was recovered , I saw her running off , so I pushed from the Men , and got hold of her again , and called out for the Watch , as hard as I could call . I resolved I would not loose my hold , nor let her go , but the Fellows came up again to me , and swore d - n my Bl - d they would beat my Brains out , if I did not let her go . However , I held her till the Watch came up to my Assistance ; for in her running from me . She happened to run nearer the Watch-house : and I held her till I got her there . As soon as I had got to the Watch-house , one of the Men , who used me ill in the Street , cry 'd out , d - n him , he has lost no Watch , search him . Aye , says the Pri- soner , search him , and I will be searched too . Up- on this , I felt down my Pockets , and found my Watch in my Left-hand Coat-pocket . Then one of the Men , who was on the outside of the Door , clapp 'd himself between the 2 Doors of the Watch-house , and swore she should not stay there , for there was no Constable , ( he said ) and she should not be stopped there . I bid the Watchmen take Care of the Door , and then the Constable was sent for . The Watch was found before the Constable came . Prisoner . Ask him if he charged me with any Thing , before the Constable of the Night ? Ellington . Yes , I alledged she had robbed me of my Watch : my Hat was lost in the Skirmish . Prisoner . Was not you in Drink ? Ellington . I had been drinking , but was not drunk . Prisoner . Did not you complain that you had lost your Hat in the Scuffle , which cost 10 s. and say , - if I would give you 5 s. you would make it up ? Ellington . No , I did not . John Mackerel . I live by Bloomsbury , in Holborn , near the Place where this happened . I was coming home that Night , about a Quarter after 10 , and hearing the Prosecutor cry out , I ran up to him , and found he had hold of the Prisoner . There was one John Mar and Clem Webb there at the same Time . Webb said , d - n you , what Business have you with the Woman ? d - n you , you sha n't hold her . Ellington said he had lost his Hat first ; then , that he had lost his Watch . D - n you , says one of the Men , you 're a Fool , you do n't know what you 've lost ; you have lost nothing , and you sha n't hold the Woman : So they all cross 'd the Way , and went about 5 or 6 Yards farther ; and then they rescued the Prisoner from the Prosecutor ; cursing him at the same Time , and telling him , if he did not let the Woman go , they would knock his Brains out . Marr said this , and he had a Poker in his Hand , about 2 Foot long at the same Time . Webb said the same , and that if the Prosecutor would not let the Prisoner go , he would lick him . So they rescued her from him , and she ran away about 20 Yards , but he followed , and caught her , and pushed her into the Watch-house . The Constable not being there , they swore she should not stay there ; for they said , he had no Authority to keep her ; and Marr , with the Poker , opened the Half-door , and put the Poker in , to get it open . I saw the Prosecutor had had a Blow ; he had a Lump upon his Head , near as big as a Goose-Egg , but I ca n't tell who gave it him . I went into the Watch-house with him ; and was there when the Constable came : The Prosecutor charged her , before him , with taking his Watch . When I first came up to him in the Street , he was feeling for his Watch with one Hand , and held the Prisoner with the other ; and after he had felt about him , he said he had lost his Watch . The Constable came in 10 Minutes after he got her into the Watch-house , and he said , he had lost his Hat , but he did not charge her with that , only with his Watch . I do n't remember what the People said in the Watch-house ; but when he came in there , his Coat Pocket stood open , and in a little Time , he found it in that Pocket . I believe they might slip the Watch into it . Neither of the Men who took the Woman 's Part were then in the Watch-house ; only an old Man they call the Governour of the Watch-house , the Prisoner and the Prosecutor were there at that Time : I was close to the Door , but afterwards I went in . Prisoner . Was not the Prosecutor in Liquor ? Mackarel . I never saw the Prosecutor before that Time , in my Life . Upon my Oath I do n't know that he was fuddled ; he had been drinking he said , but I did not observe that he was fuddled . The Blow perhaps might disorder him a little just then , but in a Quarter of an Hour afterward , he was as well as any Man in the World . Prisoner . Was he not willing to make it up , if I would give him Five Shillings for the Loss of his Hat ? Mackarel . There was one of the Men threaten 'd to go to Law with him , and the Man seemed not to know what to do . I did not hear him offer to make it up , but I heard them offer him Money for that purpose , and he did not say he would take it . As to his Hat I never saw it at all ; it was gone before I saw him . Prisoner . How did the Prosecutor at that Time say he was attacked ? Mackarel . He said he came from the Cock-Inn , in Aldersgate-street , and gave exactly the same Account of the Thing , as he has done now . John Ball . Between 10 and 11 I was standing at my own Door , just by Kingsgate-street , in Holborn , and hearing an Outcry , and a Noise , I went to see what was the Matter . And about 2 or 300 Yards from my Door , I observed 2 or 3 Men with a Woman , who was striving to get away . One Man insisted upon keeping her , and would not let her go ; but 3 Men endeavoured to get her off . He that held her , said she had robbed him of his Hat and his Watch . I stood a little while , and saw a lusty Man , pretty well dressed , who said she should go , - this was at the End of Kingsgate-street , and as she was going to the Watch-house , he said , she should go away , for there was no proper Officer to detain her there . The Man that held her in Custody , said , he was an Officer himself . The other Men said he had no Power to take her , or detain her , because the Cause was his own . I made answer , and said , - every Man is an Officer to detect a Thief ; upon which they were silent a little , and the Woman immediately ran away from him . I imagine the Man was held while she elop 'd , but he followed her sharply , and caught her again . Then I went home to my own House ; but hearing a Tumult again , I ran cross the Way , and found the Men were holding him who would have kept the Woman , and she ran away from him the second Time . But some of the People saying if she was a Thief , she ought to be brought to Justice , she was at last got to the Watch-house . What passed there I know not , for I then went home again . I never saw the Prisoner before that Night , but I am pretty sure she is the same Person . I have no Doubt but she is the same . The Man , I am positive , said , he had lost his Hat and his Watch ; but he charged her with taking his Watch only . Prisoner . Did the People , who were with me , pretend to be my Acquaintance ? Mr Ball . No ; but I apprehend they were her Acquaintance . Prisoner . Was the Prosecutor drunk or sober ? Mr Ball . Upon my Oath I apprehend he was sober , and that 's what I would not say for any Man in England , if I thought he was not so . Thomas Barret . - I do n't know the Prisoner , if I was to see her ; so I have no Occasion to look at her . All I have to say is , that on Thursday Se'ennight , in the Evening , I was in Company with Samuel Ellington , at the Cock-Inn in Aldersgate-street . I parted with him at the Gate about 10 o'clock , and he was very capable of going Home ; - I know he was very sober . Prisoner . What Quantity of Liquor did you drink ? Barret . Why some Men drink more , others drink less ; - I believe we had a Shilling a-piece in Punch , and some Beer , I believe : but he ( upon my Oath ) is a Man not given to drinking . He was capable of going Home , I do assure you . Mr Smith , the Master of the Cock-Inn , gave much the same Account . James Robinson . I was not there when the Fact was committed ; but I was at Moore the Constable 's , the next Day , with the Prosecutor , and the Prisoner was there at the same Time . When we had talk 'd there a little while , in came one John Gascoigne , and he sollicited for the Prisoner , and in her Presence would have had the Prosecutor to have made up the Affair , but he refused . I asked her whether she was a marry 'd Woman ? She told me she was a Widow ; but when she was before Colonel De Veil , she said she was a marry 'd Woman ; that her Husband was a Soldier , and followed some Business in Leadenhall-Market , and that she was not willing , on that Account , to be expos 'd . Prisoner 's Defence . I happened to be at Mr Harris 's House in Holborn , till 10 at Night , and was going Home . The Prosecutor came up to me in the Street , and insisted upon my going with him . I refused ; he seemed drunk , and said he was an Officer . I told him I was a very honest Woman , and never went with a Man in my Life ; but he took hold of my Handkerchief , and began to be rude ; upon which I cry 'd out , and some Gentlemen came up , and asked him what he wanted with me , and if he had lost any Thing ? First , he said he had lost his Handkerchief , afterwards he had lost his Watch , and the Minute he came into the Watch-house , he pulled it out of his Pocket . Then the Gentlemen called him Rogue , and asked him how he could serve the Poor Woman so , when he had got his Watch ? He said he had nothing to alledge against me , but he had lost his Hat among the Mob , and I should give him a Crown , for it cost him 10 Shillings . A Man afterwards came into the Watch-house , and persuaded him to swear for the Sake of the Reward * . * In this Case there was no Reward at all . Clement Webb . I remember the Prosecutor . This Day Fortnight in the Evening , I saw him at the End of Kingsgate-street a little after 10 . He had got that Woman there , - I believe , - I never saw her before , - till Yesterday , - I believe it to be that Woman . - It was very Moonlight ; - He had her by the Handkerchief , and 3 or 4 People were with her . I believe there were 3 Men with her , - I will take upon me to say there were 3 Men with her : and I coming along , asked what was the Matter , seeing a Man hold a Woman by the Throat , and the Prosecutor was drunk at the same Time . He said the Woman had robbed him , and had robbed him of his Hat . There were 2 or 3 Gentlemen more with me , and I said , Gentlemen , Which Way possible could the Woman rob the Man of his Hat ? I asked him , Which Way he lost his Hat ? With a good deal of Discourse , he signified , that he intended to be very free with her ; then I concluded , that his attempting to be rude with her , might occasion his Hat to be dropped . I said , Why do n't you loose the Woman and look for your Hat ? He said , D - n her , he was a Constable of St Giles 's , and would not loose her ; but drew her over the Way to a Soap-Boiler 's Shop , and there by the Perswasion of the People , and of me among the rest , - we persuaded him to let her go , that she might go to the Round-House . Accordingly we went , to go to the Round-House , and the Woman ran away from him , just above Queen-street . When he was got on the other Side Queen-street , the Woman was gone a little Way before . Then he said , d - n her , he had lost his Watch , and immediately he ran after her , and catch 'd her by both her Hands , and pull 'd her into the Round-House . There was an Old Man , who they call the Round-house-keeper , he let them in . She told him , she had not his Watch ; I will be searched , says she , - or search me , - one or the other . Accordingly she goes to search her self , and in searching herself , she said , let somebody search him , and see if his Watch is not about him . Then he searched himself , and I believe it was out of his Left-hand Coat or Waistcoat Pocket , - I ca n't tell which , - he pull 'd out his Watch . After this , I wanted to get into the Round-house , but the Old Man who keeps it would not let me come in , but sent away for a Constable . The Constable I happened to know , and so I was let in : after which there was Brawling and Noise for an Hour , and to no Effect , for the Prosecutor was so drunk , that what he said one Minute , he did not know the next . At last he concluded , that if the Prisoner would give him five Shillings , he would excuse her , and let her go about her Business . I should have said , - there was some other People came in , and the Woman would have been clear 'd , if they had not perswaded him to charge her , - and that when I asked him how he could lose his Hat with her , he said , he 'went to - ( The Witness made Use of a very indecent Expression ) and this the Prosecutor admitted , when he was with the Woman in the Round house . My Name is Webb , and I am an Ironmonger in Long-Acre . Thomas Moore . I was Constable of the Night ; this Day fortnight I was sent for , about a Quarter , or Half an Hour after 10 , and was told there was a Bustle about a Robbery . Upon which I went down , and found the Prosecutor and the Woman in the Watch-house ; Webb was at the Door , and desired to come in ; I ordered him to be let in , and then I asked the Prosecutor what he charged the Woman for . He said he had lost his Watch , but found it again in his Pocket . Says I , Do you suspect she took it ? I ca n't say that , and I am sure , ( says he ) she could not take it , for I held both her Hands . What do you charge her for then ? Why , says he , I have lost my Hat , I do n't suspect she took it , I believe it was lost in the Scuffle . Then says I , you have nothing to charge the Woman with . No , not I , says he , the Hat cost me Half a Guinea ; and if she will give me 5 s. she may go about her Business . I asked him , what he charg 'd these Gentlemen for , and Mr Webb ? He said , he had nothing to say to them , only begged they would appear next Morning to go before a Justice ; but Webb was obliged to go out of Town . After this , by somebody 's Perswasion , he persisted in the Charge , and that the Woman should be sent to the Round-House , or some other Prison : she begged to go to the Round-House , and I took the Prosecutor 's Word , and Webb 's Word 'till next Morning . The Prosecutor said he had got a Knock , and he had received a Blow , but he said he could not tell how he came by it . If it had been given with a Poker , it would have made an Impression in the Man 's Head . I did take the Prosecutor to be in Liquor . I have known Webb 20 Years ; he is a Man of Worth and Credit . Prosecutor . Ask Moore , upon his Oath , if he did not say in the Watch-house , that he thought the Blow was give me with the Poker ? Moore . I should have done myself a great deal of Injury to think so . Thomas Reeve . I was at the Watch-house , and saw the Prisoner and the Prosecutor there ; she ask 'd him several Times if he had lost any Thing ? He said he had lost his Watch , but that he could not alledge she took it , for he had found it in his Pocket . The Constable asked him over and over , if he had lost any Thing ? He told him , he had lost nothing but his Hat , which cost Half-a-Guinea , and if she would give him five Shillings , he would not trouble his Head with her . But there was a Man in the Watch-house would have him insist upon charging her , and said it might be something in his Way . The Prosecutor was pretty much in Liquor to my thinking . Thomas Kilburn . The Constable asked the Prosecutor whether he charg 'd the Woman or not ? He said , Yes ; but I do n't know that you have robbed me of any Thing , but I have lost my Hat , and if you 'll give me a Crown , I 'll release you . He said he had found his Watch in his Left-hand Coat-Pocket ; I did not hear him say any Thing about it 's having been taken from him . He was so much in Liquor , that if he spoke one Word - in a Minute or two , he could not remember it . John Marr gave much the same Account with Clement Webb . Sarah Green , Elizabeth Joseph , and Honour Barrington gave the Prisoner a good Character . And a Gentleman being called to Webb 's Character , said he knew no Harm of him . Acquitted . 395.

Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 397. Richard Peterson , of St Mary White-chapel , was indicted for stealing a Silk Handkerchief , val . 10 d. the Goods of Samuel Stork , August 2 . Mr Stork . On Saturday the 2d of August , as I was going from Whitechappel , to Ayloffe-Street , the Prisoner came after me , and picked this Handkerchief out of my Pocket . I catch 'd fast hold of him , and while I held him , he dropped it on the Ground , and I saw him drop it . So I took him before the Justice , and found he had been an old Trader this Way ; for he was known , and the Justice committed him . Prisoner . I was coming along , and the Gentleman took hold of me , and said I took his Handkerchief ; but indeed I never touched it . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 398. William Higgs , alias Haikes , was indicted for that he , on the 16th of July , in the Parish of St John Wapping , in and upon Elizabeth Cross , Spinster , did make an Assault , and her , against her Will , did ravish and carnally know . Elizabeth Cross deposed , That she was about 18 Years old ; Daughter of Mr Thomas Cross , the Master of a Ship . That on the Day mentioned in the Indictment , she was left alone in her Father 's House , and the Fore-door being bolted , the Prisoner came in at the Back-door , under Pretence of putting up a Shelf ; that he afterward fastened the Back-door , and as she was cleaning out the Passage , she throw her down upon the Stairs which lead to the Cellar , and used her in a vile Manner . The Witness , with the utmost Reluctance , and in a very modest and decent Manner , gave an Account of the Injury she had received , but could not swear to one of the two Particular Circumstances , which the Law , in such unfortunate Cases , requires to be prov 'd . The Jury therefore acquitted the Prisoner of this Indictment . He gave Security however to appear the next Sessions , when he may be indicted for an Assault with Intent to commit a Rape . 399 . + Stephen Jones , of St Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for assaulting William Swinney , and throwing him upon a Stone-Pavement , and giving him ( so lying upon the Stone-Pavement ) with both his Hands and Feet , several mortal Bruises , in and upon his Head , Neck , Stomach , and Belly , July 2 . Of which mortal Bruises he languished from the 2d to the 10th of July , and then died . He was a second Time charged by Virtue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . William Bourn . That is the Man , Gentlemen , I will tell you what I know about it . It happened about 2 months ago , as near as I can think , ( for I am no Scholar ) . - It happened that this William Swinney was murder 'd ; I am sure he was . He was going into Bowl-Yard , Broad St Giles 's , between 4 and 5 in the Morning , and this Prisoner came up to him , and tapp 'd him on the Shoulder , and said , - You Blood of a Whore , will you fight . I did not know the Prisoner before , but I know it is him , because I am positive by the Marks and Tokens that he is the Man . The Deceased said he would not fight ; I am no fighting Man , moreover , I am drunk . The Prisoner said , You Blood of a Whore , if you will not fight , I will make you fight . They had not been in Company together , for the Deceased and I had had 2 Pots of Beer together , at the Cannon and Crown in Broad St Giles 's . So when the Deceased refused to fight , the Prisoner knock 'd him down to the Ground with his Fist ; for I believe he had no Stick , nor any other Weapon . When he had knock 'd him down , he gave him 3 or 4 Kicks on the Sides , and at every Kick he cry 'd , - You Blood of a Whore , there 's Dublin for you . For he that is dead , was an Irishman ; what the Prisoner is I know not . The Deceased got up , and the Prisoner knock 'd him down 3 or 4 Times , and gave him the same Usage , and at every Kick he cry 'd out , - there 's Dublin for you . The Deceased , to the best of my Remembrance , made no Resistance in Life ; he was not able to stand , and he told the Prisoner so before he struck him . The last Kick he gave him was about the Throat , after which he lay a Quarter of an Hour senseless , and stirred neither Hand nor Foot . With that , I knowing the Man that was kill 'd , and seeing 3 or 4 Men stand at the Corner , for Fear they were Confederates , I dare not come near to assist my Acquaintance , - for Fear my Life should be lost as well as his . - I am an Irishman , - I never will deny my Country . So with this , the Man lay for the Space of a Quarter of an Hour , and did not stir Hand nor Feet , and I stood all the while leaning against a Bulk . Then the Prisoner came up to me , and said , - You Blood of a Whore , do you belong to that Man ? No , really , says I , I do n't , - I do n't know him ; I never saw him to my Knowledge . Says the Prisoner , You Blood of a Whore , you lie , you are one of his Confederates , and so he gave me a Knock on the Side of the Head , as I leaned against the Bulk , and I staggered 6 or 7 Yards , before I fell to the Ground , and then , I believe , he did not give me another Knock . Then here is the Women who stood by and said , O you cruel Man , are not you ashamed to use the poor old Man so barbarous as you do ? Meaning me , by the poor old Man . This is one of the Women who cry 'd out so , and one Tisdale , who refuses to come , is the other . What is that to you , you B - ch - s , ( says the Prisoner ) what I do , so they ran in and shut their Doors , for Fear he should do them some bodily Harm . I have no more to say , but a Word or two . The Prisoner , when he left me and the Deceased knocked down , he went with these 3 Men , who stood on the other Side , to a Night-house ( one Mr Allen 's that was ) in St Giles 's , but who keeps the House now , I do n't know ; and whether there was 3 or 4 of them I do n't know , but thither they went . The Deceased got up some Time after , and with that he went Home , I believe , to his Bed . His Home was not above 2 or 3 Stones-throw from the Place where this happened : he lives in Vine-Street , Broad St Giles 's . I did not go home with him , for I was afraid I was as bad as he , so he went home himself , but I saw him the next Morning in his Bed , about 6 o'clock , and he said he was in a bad Condition . I saw him 4 or 5 Times before he died , in a very weak Condition , as he told me , for I am no Physician . The Night before he died , he sent for me , and said , - William Bourn , I send for you to let you know a little of my Mind , by Reason you was a Witness to my Mis-usage , and my being murdered ; and I leave it as an Obligation on you , if you can find him , at any Time , to bring him to Justice , for he has actually killed me ; and he dy 'd on Wednesday , the very Day after he told me this Expression . Says I to him , No , William , my Dear , God is able to bring you from it . No , says he , I never will recover ; and my Wife is out of Town , so I leave it as an Obligation on you to bring him to Justice . He dy 'd 8 or 9 Days after he received the Hurt ; he received the Hurt on Wednesday , and he dy 'd on the Wednesday after ; I do n't know how long it was after he was hurt , for I am no Scholar ; I do n't know a B from a Bird 's Foot . He shew 'd me a great many of his Hurts , and he had every Bit of him all over hurt , and I did not see him out of his House after he was hurt . He had no Doctor , for I believe he had no Money . He used to go about with Hard-ware . Elizabeth Howel . I was out in the Street selling Rice-milk between 4 and 5 in the Morning , and saw the Prisoner meet the Deceased in Bowl Yard . The Prisoner tapp 'd the Deceased on the Shoulder , and asked him if he would fight ? The Deceased said no , and told the Prisoner he [ the Deceased ] was drunk . The Prisoner asked him what Countryman he was ? The Deceased said he was an Irishman ; upon which the Prisoner gave him a Blow , and said , if he would not fight he would make him fight . After some Blows had passed , the Deceased took hold of the Prisoner 's Shirt , and tore it . The Prisoner then beat him in a very barbarous Manner , and knock 'd him down several Times . I afterwards saw a Street-walking Woman take the Deceased to a Pump , and wash him . The Prisoner gave the Deceased some Kicks after he was knock 'd down , and the last Kick was in the Throat . The Deceased made no more Resistance , than only to take hold of the Prisoner 's Shirt , and tear it . Elizabeth Tyler . Last Wednesday Morning , about nine Weeks ago , I call 'd at my Landlady 's about 4 o'clock in the Morning , to take her Daughter with me to Paddington : as I waited at the Door for her , I saw something of a Fight , in the Bowl-Yard . One Man knocked the other down several Times . My Landlady and I called out , - You Rogue ! You Villain ! How can you use your Fellow-creature so . I never saw either of the Men before , nor have I ever seen the Prisoner since , till to Day , but I know him again . And all he said , when I spoke to him , was , - What did he tear my Shirt for . After this my Landlady and I shut ourselves in , for Fear of bringing ourselves into Trouble ; and one , whom we took to be a Woman of the Town , took him to the Pump , and washed him , and seemed very careful of him . There was 3 or 4 People stood by during the Fray . One was a Ballad-singing-Boy , and the other a Person who had been 'Prentice to a Neighbour of ours . Defence . Walter Scot . I am a Dealer in Coals . In the Beginning of July , between 3 and 4 in the Morning , I heard an Outcry and a Noise , so I jump 'd out of Bed , flung up the Sash , and saw two Men fighting in the Broad-Way : and , to the best of my Remembrance , the Prisoner was one of them . I saw some Blows struck , but from what I could perceive , they were not Blows that could occasion the Death of any one . Edward Jones deposed , That he was going with News that Morning to Kensington , between 3 and 4 in the Morning , and saw the Deceased push against the Prisoner , and heard him say , he did it for Fun . Upon which they fell to fighting , and fought a long Time . When they had done , one went one Way , and the other another . The Witness observed a Man with the Deceased , but he did not know who he was . William Hampton saw the Prisoner and the Deceased fighting a long time together that Morning ; after which the Prisoner gave out ; and then the Deceased said , - You English Bug , you have lost one Eye , and I will drive the other out . And upon the Deceased 's striking him again , the Prisoner said , - You Irish , Bog-trotting Dog , I will not give out . They then fell to fighting again , and the Witness went away , and left them engaged . Mary Hampton deposed , That she saw the Squabble , and that the Prisoner having done fighting , was about to put on his Cloaths ; but the Deceased jumped upon him again , knocked him down , and calling him Bug , said he would beat his other Eye out . Three Persons gave the Prisoner the Character of a peaceable Man . Guilty Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 400.

Aug. 23 . Hannah Prince . On the 23d of August , I was going from Limehouse to Bow , between 7 and 8 at Night , and not knowing the Way , I desired a Woman to direct me . The Prisoner , I believe , was somewhere behind , and heard me , for he came up and asked me if I was going to Bow . I said , Yes . He told me , he lived near that Place , and would put me in the Way . I returned him Thanks , and we went together through Poplar , and as he went along he spake to several Persons . At last he carried me a Back-way into a Field behind Poplar-Chapel , and then told me he must give me a green Gown . I begg 'd of him to desist , and desired him not to use me ill , but he slung me upon the Ground , and pinched me , and bit me , because I would not consent . But hearing some People coming along , I collar 'd him , and held him as long as I could ; then he got up , and as soon as I got up , he knocked me down . He gave me one Blow upon my Stomach , another upon my Arm , and one upon my Mouth , which cut my Lips against my Teeth ; then he snatched the Bundle out of my Hands , which I was carrying to Bow , and tore the Handkerchief in which the Things were tyed up , before he could get it away from me . [ The Witness gave an Account of the Things contained in the Bundle , as they are mentioned in the Indictment . ] It was near 8 , when he threw me down , but it was very Moon-light , and I believe I had walked a Mile from Limehouse , before he attacked me . When he had got my Bundle , he ran away , and I ran after him , and entreated him to give it me again ; telling him , if he took my Things , I had no more to put on . But he got over a Stile , and ran off ; and I , ( not knowing where the Path led to , ) was afraid to follow him any farther , so I stood at the Stile , and cryed , Stop Thief ! Some People came up to me , and went after him , but not being able to take him , they return 'd to me , and perswaded me to stay at Poplar that Night . I was very much surprised , and staid there till next Morning ; then they carried me to see a Man at Blackwall , who they mistrusted was the Person , from the Description I had given them of the Prisoner . But he was not the Man ; so I came back to Poplar , and saw the Prisoner pass by , near the White-horse : Upon which I jumped up , followed him , and collar 'd him , and told the People he was the Man . Then I got one to hold him , while I went to see for an Officer , and when I came back ; he confessed the Fact , and said he was sorry for it He own 'd he beat me down , and took the Things from me , and he pull 'd out one of the Handkerchiefs , ( which had been in the Bundle , ) and return 'd it to me ; his Mother being with him , he desired her to go home with me , and give me the rest of my Things . I went with her accordingly , and she returned me all but one Apron ; so I returned with her to the Prisoner , and asked him where that Apron was ? He was going to tell me , but his Mother stopp 'd him , by saying it was lost out of the Hole I tore in the Handkerchief , in which the Things were tied up . In carrying him before a Magistrate , he said , if I would let him go , he would pay me for the Apron , and he did give me a Shilling . There was 2 Men to take care of him as he went along , but some Women rescu 'd him , - I believe there were 40 of them about him . But the Gentlemen of the Town ( Poplar ) hearing the Prisoner was got away , were angry , and sent for the Officer the next Morning , and ordered him to see for him , and take him . He was afterwards re-taken , and carry 'd before Mr Justice Jones , where he confessed it again . Upon my Oath the Prisoner is the Man : I walked far enough with him to know him again . Leonard Head . The Prisoner was taken on Sunday the 24th of August , by this Woman ; and there being a great Noise , and a great many Women about him , he got away , Some Gentlemen hearing he was escaped , sent for me , ( being an Officer ) and ordered me to look after him . Accordingly I went after him all that Day to no Purpose , but on Monday Morning I apprehended him at Ratcliffe-Cross , as he was going to Work ; and having got two Men to assist me , we carry 'd him to Poplar Watch-house , till we gave the Prosecutrix Notice . As soon as she came to us , we carry 'd him before the Justice , and he owned he knocked the Woman down , and took her Bundle from her . He said he was in Liquor when he did it , and was very sorry for it . Mrs . Prince . I am sure he walked very upright ; and when he ran away from me , he ran a vast Pace . If he was in Liquor , it was not to be discerned . John Ashton . I saw Leonard Head that Monday Morning sauntering about at Ratcliffe-Cross ; I asked him the Reason of it ? He told me , some Gentlemen at Poplar had threatened him , for not taking a Thief . I asked him if he knew the Man ? He said , Yes ; and told me who he was . So I carry 'd him to an Alehouse , where a Parcel of Lumpers ( i. e. Men employed in unloading Ships ) were at Breakfast . He saw the Man among them , but I was afraid of their Knives , so we waited a while till he came out , and then we took him . He imme- diately owned he did the Thing , but he said he was in Liquor , and had given the Woman the Things again , and a Shilling . We went down to his Mother , and asked for the Apron which was wanting , and she said her Son had given the Woman a Shilling to satisfy her . Before the Justice he owned he robbed her , and knock 'd her down , and said he was sorry for it , and it was the first Fact he ever had done in his Life . I made Answer , and said , - it was too soon now . Bomer Loveit . When we were going to Prison with him , I desired him to let the Woman have the Apron that was missing : He told me his Mother had pawn 'd it . I went to the Mother about it , and she went with me to the Pawnbroker 's ; I redeemed it , and the Prosecutrix owned it . Prince . I described the Marks to them before they shew 'd it me . I knew it by the broad Hem , a Darn , and a Hole burnt in it by a Spark which flew out of the Fire . Brian Evans likewise proved the Prisoner 's Confession before the Justice . Elizabeth Robinson , Mary Flemming , and Mary Blow deposed , That the Prisoner worked with their Master , ( a Throwster ) and had been entrusted very much in their Master 's House ; that he always behaved well , and they never heard any Harm of him before .

On the 1st of December last , I was going home between 11 and 12 at Night , and met with 2 Woman , who carried me to a House of the Prisoner 's in a Court near Charing-Cross . We had something to drink , and I was about half an Hour in their Company . When the Half-Hour was expired , they went away , and I missed my Watch that Moment . I called the Prisoner , and asked her if she knew the Women ? She said , no ; she never saw them before . I never saw them before in my Life ; but the Prisoner brought up the Liquor , and seem 'd to know them then , and she was in Company with them 4 or 5 Minutes , but I ca n't swear she took it . They were lewd Women who were with me , and I lost it in her House , and that 's all I know . Acquitted . 417.

May 6 . Richard Mason . On the 6th of May last , between 1 and 2 in the Afternoon , as I was going to Colney-Hatch , the Prisoner stood poring over the Side of a Pond , and said , there was a large Rat ran out . I said , it may be so . The Prisoner then came from the Pond , and about 20 Yards from it , he pick 'd up a Catcher and Ball . Upon that , John Clarke , ( who was convicted for this Robbery last May Sessions ) stepped up , and bought the Catcher and Ball for Six-pence ; and they desired me to go with them , and drink Part of the Money out , because I was at the picking it up . I went cross the Fields with them to Mr. Spencer 's , at the Adam and Eve at Pancras ; John Clarke called for a Pint of Home-brew 'd , I sat down on the Bench at the Door , but they desired me to go backwards with them ; I did so , and Mrs. Spencer brought the Home-brew 'd and some Bread and Cheese to us . As soon as we had set down , Clarke went farther backwards , and left his Hat , as if he was gone only to the little House . He returned to the Prisoner and me , and brought another Man with him . Then the Prisoner desired Clarke to lay a Wager of a Shilling , ( in play with the Catcher and Ball , ) to make the Company drink . The Prisoner and Clarke play 'd for a Shilling , and then the Prisoner desired me to give him 2 Six-pences for a Shilling . I pull 'd out a Guinea , and 4 or 5 Shillings , and the Prisoner snatch 'd the Gui- nea out of my Hand . Then they made a Hustle , and turn 'd me out at the Back-Gate of Spencer 's House . Finding what Company I was in , I was glad to go off with the Loss of my Money ; but they followed me beyond the George Alehouse , about a Hundred Yards from Spencer 's , and John Clarke made a full Stop before me ; the Prisoner kept close to my Right side ; the third Man got close to me on the Left-hand , and they seemed as if they were going to something of the Game again , which they had been at before . I seem 'd to draw back , and then the third Man ( who is not taken ) demanded my Watch ; and in the Surprise and Fear , that I was in , ( for they put me in fear , when my Watch was demanded , ) the Man who is not taken , threw up the Flap of my Coat , and took it out of my Pocket ; then he gave it to John Clarke , who ran away with it directly , over the Fields . I made after Clarke , but the Prisoner and the other stood in the Road to boggle me , and so I lost Clarke first , and the Prisoner and the other Man soon after . Upon this , I went back to Spencer 's , but I could find nobody in the House , who belonged to it . The second Time I went , I saw Spencer 's Wife , and told her , I had been robb 'd of my Watch , by the Men who had been there . She seem 'd to refuse to hear me , till I told her , I would speak to her . Then she went out at the Back-Door , and hush 'd me , that I should say nothing before the Company ; and at the Back-Door she told me , she was very sorry , and if I pleased to come again the next Day , which was Hanging-Day , they would be certainly there , and I might take 'em , if I brought an Officer with me ; for one of the Malefactors ( she said ) was to be bury 'd there , that Night . The next Day I took 2 Officers , and another Man , and we went thither . I desired the Men to go into the House , and see if such Persons were there . They went , and were inform 'd that such a Thing had happened , and then I went in myself . Prisoner . Did you not declare that you had lost your Watch and Money at Play ? Mason . No , I did not . Prisoner . Did not you say , after you had been at Franklin 's , that you had lost your Money and Watch at play with a Footman and 2 other Men ? And did not you ask how you must come by them again ? Mason . No , I did not . The first Person I went to was Mr Justice Chamberlain , and took out a Warrant for these Men ; but not knowing their Names , I went to Henry Mould 's , and described them to him . Prisoner . Did not Mould tell you , the only Way to get your Watch and Money again , was to prosecute them , and then you 'd get them again , and something for your self to boot ? Mason . No ; no such Thing . No one designed any such Thing . Snowden Hall . I know the Prisoner absconded after this supposed Robbery was committed . He used a House of a bad Character , - the Horse and Groom , in the Lane next to where I live , before the Fact ; but he did not use it afterwards . I know the Prisoner , and he knows me ; but when he was taken , he would not know me . Afterwards he confessed he knew me , but did not care to own it . Robert Rhodes . Mason brought this Warrant to me , the 7th of May , in the Morning . Mould , and another Brother-Officer went with us to Spencer 's , and we went in first , and called for a Pint of Wine , and talked to the Woman of the House . Then Mason came in , and not finding any of the Men there , we went to several other Places ; but in the Evening we took Jack Clarke . in James-Street , Covent-Garden . The Prisoner lodg 'd in the Bowl-Yard , but after this , he absconded , and went to Thomas's-Street , and from thence to Moorfields . When he was taken , he said he knew us to be a parcel of Thief-takers , and that he knew nothing of the Matter . Henry Mould . I know nothing of the Robbery ; I very well remember the Prosecutor work 'd at Colney-Hatch , the 6th of May . He is a Carpenter , and was at work , where I did the Turner 's Work . In the Afternoon he came running to my House , out of Breath , and said he had been robb 'd of his Watch and a Guinea , as he was going to Colney-Hatch . He described the Men to me , and I knowing such People , living in the Neighbourhood , I put it close him , - Richard , Did not you game with them ? He deny 'd it very strongly , and shewed me a Warrant he had to take them up , but the Warrant was for no body , for there was no Name mentioned in it . So he went to Colonel De Veil , and got a Warrant , and Clarke was apprehended very soon after . I am a Turner , and keep a Publick House ; the Two Blue-Posts , at the upper end of Drury Lane . The Prisoner , in his Defence , urged that the Prosecutor first lost his Money , by wagering with Clarke that he did not catch the Ball upon the little End of the Catcher , once in 6 Times ; that he af- ter this followed them out into the Road , and insisted that Clarke should lay a Guinea 6 Times against the Watch , and if he won , he was to have it . That Clarke having won the Watch , went away with it , and the Prosecutor afterwards came to the Prisoner at the George , and told him the Seal which hung to the Watch was none of his own . Sarah Spencer . About May last Mason came to our House , but I ca n't say I saw him drink any Thing , or that I saw him with any Company , only with a Man in a green Livery , and he was sitting upon a Bench at the Door . I ca n't say where he went , when he went away , but about an Hour afterward he came again , and asked if his Company were gone ? I told him I did not know what he meant . He asked me , if I did not know the People he was with ? I said , I knew them by passing by the Door , and drinking , and that they were what We call Orange-Barrow-Men . I asked him , - What was the Matter ? He said he had lost a Silver Watch , a Guinea , and a Gold Seal . Pray what Way ? and he said , by the Ball and Catcher , - upon my Oath he did . Jury . We would ask her , if he did not say he was robb 'd of his Watch , & c. For he might say he lost it , when the People were there with their Ball and Catcher ? Spencer . He said he lost it - with - the Ball and Catcher . He did not say he had been robb 'd , - to my Knowledge . - I do n't know that he did . Mason . I beg she may be ask 'd , if she did not tell me they were a Pack of Thieves , and that I might take them , if I would come there next Day ? Spencer . I said they were a Pack of Villains , and that they had been with my Husband to treat with him about burying a Man , and the next Day being Execution-day , I judged they would come and bring the Man to be buried . I thought it was a Fraud , - and being a Fraud , I thought he might get his Things again . William Cheatham . I am a Stove grate Maker . I do n't know Mason , - but I was going to my Mistress , on the 6th of May ( one Mrs Petty , at Kentish Town ) and my Master bid me call at Spencer 's , at the Adam and Eve at Pancras , for a Pitch-pot . When I came there I saw 2 or 3 Men at the Door , all in a Heap and I look 'd in , and saw two Men playing with a Catcher . This was at about five or six o'clock at Night . I went by them into Spencer 's House , and got the Pitch-pot . As I went home I met Mason , and he asked me if I had seen 2 or 3 Men pass by ? and he told me he had lost his Money and Watch with the Fellow , with the Catcher , - he had lost them with playing with a Catcher . He did not complain to me of the Robbery . Charles Berriman deposed , that he heard Mould say they must keep the Prosecutor to it , now he had sworn , else they should lose their Money . Elizabeth Moore . The Prisoner lodged with me , about a Twelve-month ago , and paid me honestly . He always kept very good Hours ; and if he came home when I was a-bed , he always had the Key of the Door to let himself in ; and I never heard any Harm of him . Nicholas Moore . We have entrusted him with the Key of the Door , to let himself in . He generally came home at 9 or 10 o'clock , - seldom kept any later Hours . I never lost any thing in my Life , nor ever heard any Harm of him . John Thrist , ( the Executioner ) was called next , ( by the Prisoner ) who desired he might give an Account of Jack the Catcher 's Declarations concerning him ; but as this was not legal Evidence , he was dismissed . John Arthur . When we went to Spencer 's , I heard her say , - This Thing might be made up , very easily , for her Husband had made up such Things as these several Times . I took it with Relation to the Robbery , - I believe Mrs Spencer meant it , as the Things were won at Play . Mrs. Spencer . Did not I say , he told me , the Things were lost with the Catcher and Ball ? Arthur . I do n't remember it . Rhodes . I heard her say , if he would be easy , he might have his Things again . M ould . As for my Part , I ca n't say nothing to the Words of Mrs Spencer at this Time , for I was drinking Wine , and eating Bacon . William Brownjohn , Whiston Bristow , and John Burges , gave Spencer and his Wife a good Character , and did not believe she would perjure herself . The Jury acquitted him . 420. Mary Forrest was indicted for stealing a linnen Cap , val . 5 s. and a Silver Tea-Spoon , val . 2s . the Goods of Charles Syer , July 14 . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 421. James Hicks ( a Boy ) was indicted for stealing 7 Yards and a Foot of Silver Lace , value 10 s. the Goods of Charles Fletewoord , Esq ; August 15 . Isaac Steed . The Prisoner was put into Possession of Drury-Lane Play-house , on Account of Mr Fletewood 's Misfortunes , and he declared to me , on the 15th of August , that he stole the Lace off the Prince 's Canopy ; there were 7 Yards and 1 Foot of narrow Lace taken away , and he owned he sold it to Mr. Dinely for 6 d. I have laid it in the Indictment , but at 10 s. tho ' I believe 5 l. would not make good what was taken away . I ca n't be a Judge what it was worth , if it was to have been sold . William Hobson . When the Lace was missing , the Boy was taken up ; and for 2 Hours he would confess nothing . Afterwards he own 'd it , and said he had sold it to Mr Dinely . It was a narrow single Lace , upon the Canopy which is put up when his Royal Highness comes to the House . Samuel Dinely . I keep a Silversmith 's Shop in Drury-Lane . Mr. Hobson came to me , and asked me if I had not bought some Silver Lace ? I told him I had bought a Six-penny Weight . I saw no more , and it was as black as my Hat , and good for nothing but the Fire . I gave the Prisoner Six-pence for it , - it weighed no more . I knew the Boy to be a Neighbour , and had not heard any Harm of him . I asked him how he came by it ? And he told me he had it off an old Elbow-Chair Ann Lewis and Ann Gardiner spoke to the Prisoner 's Character . Acquitted . The Court reprimanded Mr Dinely , for his Concern in the Affair . 422. John Robinson * was indicted for stealing a Pair of Silver Spurs , val . 12 s. and a Horse-whip , value 2 s. and 6 d. the Goods of William Gray , August 15 .

Ann Kelly was indicted for stealing eight Guineas , and 2 Half-Guineas , the Money of Mary Collins , September 2 . Mary Collins . The Prisoner lodged with me in Plumbtree Street , Bloomsbury . We had 2 Rooms on the same Floor , and we made Use of each other 's Room . On Tuesday last she asked me to go with her , and see a Room of Goods , in Drury-Lane . I went ; and when I came Home , I found my Keys upon the Bed , and the Money mentioned in the Indictment was taken out of my Box . I had left the Key of my Door where I always did , that as she was to come Home before me , she might know where to find it ; for she always dressed and undress 'd her Child in my Room . As I could suspect nobody but the Prisoner , ( for no one else had been in my Room , ) I taxed her with it , and she deny 'd it . I go a-washing for my Living ; but my Husband left me Part of this Money for my Child , and desired me not to break it . When I came home , I found the Prisoner had come in , and was gone out again . I had been abroad 2 Hours , and there are 2 Families live in the House , ( 6 or 7 People in all ) but nobody has the Privilege to go into my Room but the Prisoner . On the Saturday before , she said , she had laid out all her Money at Market , but 3 Pence ; and when I charged her with taking my Money , she said , O Lord , I would not hurt you for the World , do you think I robb 'd you ? I have nothing but a little small Money . But I saw her have Money in her Hand , and told her of it ; upon which she ran down Stairs , and I calling out to stop her , she dropped 2 Guineas and 2 Shillings in the Passage . This was the very Day I lost my Money . The Prisoner deals in Fruit , and I have lent her 4 or 5 Shillings several Times to go to Market with . When she was before Colonel De Veil , she took out a Guinea from these Rags , and gave it to the Colonel . The Rags I am sure were in my Box with the Money , but she insisted upon it , that the Money was her own . Judith Roach . Upon the Woman 's missing her Money , I went out to see after the Prisoner , and brought her home , and she went up stairs into her Room jingling some Money . Collins asked her what that was ? Upon which she ran down Stairs as fast as she could , and Collins called out , - stop her , she has got my Money ! I stopped her at the Threshold of the Door , and she dropped 2 Guineas and 2 Shillings . She told Colonel De Veil it was her Money , and she pulled out another Guinea out of her Petticoat , and said she had 2 Guineas more in her Stays ; all which Money she begged for in the late hard Frost , and worked for on other Times . While she was at the Justice 's , I was sent home , to search her Room , with the Constable , and we found 2 Guineas in her Stays , but she said , these too were her own . Collins . The Prisoner lodg 'd with me a Quarter of a Year before I came to this House , and I know no Harm of her but this . Roach . The Prisoner and Prosecutrix had been but 3 Weeks , in my House . I did not enquire after the Prisoner 's Character when she came , because she came with Collins , and I knew her before . Mary Kelly * . I am no Relation to the Prisoner , but I know her to be a very honest Woman , and a very just Woman . She maintains herself by selling Things about the Streets , and she goes out with her Child , to look for a Bit of Bread . I know she offered to lend my Mother 2 Guineas , about a Month after the late hard Frost ; but my Mother did not borrow it . Acquitted . * In the following Trial , ( which came on immediately after this ) Kelly appeared as a Witness for Shilcock the Fidler , by the Name of Mary Marson . 424. Hannah Stuart , alias Yorkshire Hannah , of Pancras , was indicted for stealing a Silver Watch , val . 5 l. the Goods of Walter Simmons , Aug. 18 . And 425. William Shilcock , for receiving the same , knowing it to be stole , Aug. 18 . Simmons . On the 18th of August last , a Fellow-Workman and I went to Tottenham-Court-Fair , and he there meeting with Company , I was not willing to interrupt him ; so I left him , and walked by a Booth , which was kept by one Cummins . The Prisoner Stuart was in the Booth , and asked me to come in and drink ; telling me there was as good Liquor , as any in the Fair . So I went in , and called for a Pint of Beer , but they brought a Decanter of Cyder , which came to 5 d. and I had but a Groat in my Pocket ; However , the Drawer said he would trust me t'other Penny . She drank the first Glass , and while I was drinking another , she took the Watch out of my Pocket , and I felt it go + ; at the same Time . As soon as she had got it , she ran out of the Booth , at the Back-door . I pursu 'd her to the Door , but found it fast , and was going to break it open , but the Drawer came to me , and asked me what I meant by making a Riot in the Booth , and who I brought in , to make the Riot ? I was afraid of going out , for Fear of being murder 'd ; so there being a Bed in that Part of the Booth , I lay down , and nobody came near me for some Time . At last she came to me again , and said , My Dear , what makes you so melancholy ? I hope you 'll give me something to drink . And I , with that vulgar Word , call 'd her Bitch of Hell , and said , she was the Woman that robb 'd me . She told me I was drunk ; when I was as sober as I am now . I took hold of her Arm , and said , I would take Care of her , and told the People in the Booth , that she had robb 'd me ; but they only laughed at me , and made Game of me . There were a dozen People ( in all ) in the Booth , and I complained to them ; but the Drawer got between me and the Door , and rioted me . At last some Men coming by , I told them I was robb 'd , so they assisted me , and she was seized , and carry 'd that Evening to Holborn Round-house , and the next Morning before a Justice , where she deny 'd the Fact , and said , she never saw me , nor knew any Thing of me . + The Prisoner had been indicted capitally for privately Stealing , but the Fact appearing otherwise they were then acquitted , and this Indictment for Larceny directed . George Hunt . On the 18th of August , between 9 and 10 at Night , I was coming through the Fair with two of my Friends , and I saw Simmons have hold of the Prisoner , on the Outside of the Booth , crying out , Help me , I am robb 'd . I asked him what he was robb 'd of ? He said he was robb 'd of his Watch by the Prisoner , Yorkshire Hannah , and if you 'll help me , I will pay you for your Trouble . Upon this we took her into the Booth , and kept her in Custody while we sent for an Officer . When we had sat about a Quarter of an Hour , Lawrence , the next Witness , said , she had given something to Shilcock . Shilcock ran through the Booth into the Back-place , where the Bed was ; I ran after him , and saw him toss something out of his Hand toward the Bed . I suspected it was the Watch , and desired to speak to the Man who belonged to the Booth ; but another Man came up to me , and endeavoured to pull me out of the Place . I told them , if they opposed me , I would send them all to Newgate ; so at last the Master and Mistress came , and they deny 'd that they knew the Woman . I bid them get me a Candle , and as soon as it came I searched , and found the Watch at the Feet of the Bed , and put it into my Pocket ; but I would not let Simmons see it , till he told all the Marks of it before the Constable . As we were all coming out of the Booth we saw Shilcock , and seized him , ( but I really believe he was so drunk , he did not know what he did ) then we got a Light to go with us to London . Shilcock was the Fidler of the Booth ; I believe he was so drunk , he did not know ( what ) one Hand ( did ) from the other , and I believe he would not have done such a Thing , if he had been sober . The Prosecutor described the Watch in a very exact Manner , before I shewed it him , and then he owned it . Thomas Lawrence and John Swain confirmed the former Evidence . Lawrence saw Shilcock come behind the Prisoner Stuart , as she sat between Him and Swain , and observed her put her Hand behind her , and give something to Shilcock , which he ran away with into the Back-Room . Defence . Stuart . He came into the Booth , and was very rude with me , and then he lay down , and dosed on the Bed , and whether he dropped it there himself , I do n't know . Mary Bowers . Shilcock was my Master 's Fidler ; he gave him Half-a-Crown a-Day to play there ; and I was also a Servant in the Booth . The Prosecutor came in with the Woman , and call 'd for a Pint of Cyder , but he had not Money enough to pay for it . Presently he came out , and said he had lost his Watch : the Woman asked him if she took it ? He said , no ; and so she went away . But when she came again , he went to the Door , and said she was the Person : and several Men coming up , they insisted on keeping her till the Man got his Watch again . The Fidler was eating his Supper at the same Time : I brought him the Bread and Cheese , and drew him a Pint of Beer . The Fidler was not near them at that Time . Shilcock . Ask the Prosecutor if he saw me near him ? Simmons . No , not near me : the Woman was sitting between the two Men ; and there were 3 or 4 People about us . I stood on the Off-side . Swain . I was looking so earnestly at Hunt , that I can not say I observed her to put her Hand behind her : but Lawrence saw her , and told Hunt ? Priscilla Ellis had known Shilcock upwards of two Years ; William Purcel , 3 or 4 Years ; they said he had behaved honestly , and that for want of a Trade he play 'd the Fiddle for his Livelihood . Mary Morson * . A Minute before the Skirmish happened , Shilcock came to my Stand , in the next Booth , and asked me if I had any Victuals ? I was just going to boil a Breast of Mutton and Turneps , and before the Pot boiled this Thing happened . I believe he had no Hand in it , for I have known him 10 Years , and he might have wrong 'd a Woman that keeps a Publick-House , but he never did ; and he always laboured for his Family . * This Woman appeared for the Prisoner , in the foregoing Trial , by the Name of Mary Kelly . Hester Rhimer . About a Year ago the Prisoner ( Shilcock ) liv 'd in my House in Ship-Yard , and I trusted him over all my Money and Business . He never wronged me of a Halfpenny in his Life , but behaved honestly . He fiddles about for his Bread . Stuart Guilty . Shilcock Acquitted . [ Transportation .

And 8 Holland Shirts , val . 3 l. the Goods of Persons unknown , in the Dwelling-house of Henry Grubb . July 28 . Mr. Grubb . I live in St James's-street , and am a Pawnbroker . On Saturday the 26th of July , Mrs Grubb and I told out 205 Guineas , not all in Guineas ; but in Guineas and Portugal Pieces , to that Value . I put the Money in a Bag , and then lock 'd it up in my Bureau , in the Parlour , behind my Shop . In the Evening I had a pretty deal of Money in my Pocket , so I put 60 L . all in Gold , out of my Pocket into the Bag . On Sunday Morning I went out of Town , and came home on Sunday Evening . The Prisoner , who was my Servant , went out of Town with us , and came home with us . On Sunday Evening I felt the Cabinet , and found it fast and secure , so I did not open it . Next Morning between 7 and 8 , my Daughter came to me , before I was up , and told me the Cabinet was broke open . I immediately got up , and found my Bag , and Purse , and all my Money gone , and the Cabinet broke open . It was not unlock 'd , for it was a very good Lock , and there was a Plate above it , and below it , to secure it ; but it was wrench 'd open ; the Plates were flown , and the Lock was shot , so that it could not be shut close . All the Money mentioned in the Indictment , was in the Bag and Purse ; but I ca n't recollect what particular Pieces were in the Bag , and what , in the Purse . Upon missing the Money , I called all my Servants about me ; and the Prisoner told me , he found the Area Doors under the Kitchen open , when he got up , and he believed the Thieves came in that Way . But I looked at the Doors , and there was no Violence had been used to them , and they were strong and substantial ; so I said , possibly they might go out that Way ; but which Way did they come in ? He said he could not tell , - he was very innocent . I suspected the Prisoner , because all the rest of my Servant s are employed in Trade ; and are entrusted with great Sums of Money every Day , and if any of them had had a Mind to have deceived me , they could have done it other Ways . So I sent for a Constable , who desired he might search the Hayloft and Stables , ( for the Prisoner served me as a Footman ) , and in searching , he had the good Success to find all the Money , and I had it all again . When the Money was found , we tax 'd him with it ; and he insisted upon his Innocency . After this we searched him , and found a Handkerchief which I had lost some Time , and this Knife in his Pocket ; here 's an Eye ( a Hole ) in the Blade , and upon examining the Cabinet , we found every Impression made in it , fitted this Tool , as exactly as if they had been made by it ; and the Flap of the Cabinet being lined with green Velvet , had been press 'd by the Tool , and in the press 'd Part , there was a little Space unpress 'd , which exactly fitted the Hole in the Knife . The Prisoner did not lie in the Stables , but over the very Room from whence the Money was taken . I asked him , if he had been out that Morning ? He told me , - no farther than the Stables ; but remembering he had a Sister-in-law , by Red-Lion-Square , that he called upon sometimes , I went to Colonel De Veil 's for a Warrant to search there ; but I had no occasion to make use of it ; for I asked her if she knew John Weller ? She said , Yes ; and told me he had brought her 6 Holland Shirts that very Morning ; shewed them to me , and they are the Shirts of a Gentleman who pledg 'd them at my House , and they were taken out of my Warehouse . There are eight Shirts in the Indictment ; two of them we found in his Possession , one in his Box , and the other in his Room ; they are of a coarser Sort ; the six fine ones are worth three Guineas , or thereabouts ; here are our Tickets upon them . I ca n't be so positive to these 2 , as I am to the other 6 , because they were in the Holland when they were pledg 'd ; but have been made up since . Prisoner . How is it possible , I should take the Shirts out of the Warehouse , when I never was in it 3 Times in my Life ? Mr Grubb . Our Warehouse-door is generally open , and he goes through the Warehouse to fetch Corn ; and Mrs Grubb has been so indiscreet , as to give him the Key , to go thro ' the Warehouse by himself . Prisoner . What Character had you with me from my Lady Salisbury ? Mr Grubb . I was to blame to take him on so slight a Character ; I took him on the Character given him by a Servant , and never enquired any farther . Mrs Grubb confirm 'd her Father 's Evidence . Robert Morris . The 28th of July in the Morning Mr Grubb sent for me , and told me of this Affair , and that he suspected no one but the Prisoner , and would have had me have taken him into Custody : I called him out , and desired him to take the Prisoner down Stairs , while we searched the Hayloft , and Stable . Mr Grubb said , he fear 'd 'twould be to no purpose , for the Prisoner had been out that Morning with a Bundle . I told him , if we searched and found it not , we should but have our Labour for our Pains . So Mr Grubb , and I , and his Brother searched the Stables , and a Warehouse , where he sells Coals , and in rummaging about , we found a Hat : so we searched farther , and Mr Grubb 's Brother found a Bag of Money . I took it out of his Hand , and felt in it , and there was the Purse likewise in the Bag . I carried them to Mrs Grubb , and they were soon after carried with the Prisoner before the Justice . [ The Witness mentioned the Pieces of Money in the Bag , and Purse , as they are in the Indictment . ] The Prisoner said he was as innocent as the Child unborn ; but we searched him , and found this Knife upon him , and a Pair of Scissars , and a Handkerchief . The Knife exactly fitted the Impressions which had been made in the Bureau , by wrenching it open . After he was committed , we broke open his Box , and found a Shirt in it , which Mr Grubb claimed . Alice Weller . I live in Eagle-street , by Red-Lion-Square , and follow Plain-work . The Prisoner brought me 6 Shirts that Morning , but here are only 5 of them . They have not brought them all right , for this is not one of them ; this is one I made for him . He brought them the 28th of July in the Morning ( I think ) about 7 o'clock , before I was out of my Bed . Mrs Grubb . I found the Cabinet broke about about a Quarter before 8 . Weller . He knock 'd at my Door , and said , he had got 6 Holland Shirts for me to mark . I ask 'd him , how he came to have so many ready-made Shirts , when I work 'd for my Bread ? He told me , his Master was a Pawnbroker , and they had a Sale once a Month ; and he being in Favour with the 'Prentice and Journeyman , they could get them cheaper for him of his Master , than he could get them for himself . They were Holland , and he told me he gave Half-a Guinea a-piece for them : then he said he was in haste , and went away . He had his white Frock on , and his Velvet Cap . Mr Grubb . We have no such Sales at such Times , nor were these Shirts sold . Weller . When he went away , he told me , he believed he should come away from his Master next Day , and begg 'd I would speedily mark them for him ; and four of them being full-trimm 'd , he desired I would pick of the Ruffles for him ; which I did . In May last he brought me some Holland , cut out for 2 Aprons , with a Piece of coarse Cloth . I made him a Shirt of the 2 Aprons , and this is that Shirt . Mr Grubb took the Piece of coarse Cloth from me . In June he brought me another Piece of Holland , and I made him another Shirt ; but that Shirt is not here . Mr Grubb that Afternoon had me before Colonel De Veil . I delivered the Shirts to him , and said he was welcome to search any where in my Room . He put it hard to me , - whether I had any Thing belonging to the Prisoner , and said I must deliver it . I then spoke of the Piece of coarse Cloth , and the Prisoner having given it me , I put a Piece of my own to it , and made me an Apron , and this Mr Grubb took from me . Prisoner . Ask her if , some time ago , she did not go with me to buy a Piece of Holland , to make me 2 trimm 'd Shirts . Weller . Yes , I did . He lived at that Time with the Countess of Salisbury , and behaved well I made those Shirts for him 3 Years ago , on Account of the Wedding of the Lady 's Sister . Jane Veesy . On the 28th of July , I saw the Prisoner in Mr Grubb 's Yard , about a Quarter after five in the Morning . I asked him how he came to be up so soon ? He told me he got up at four that Morning . I did not ask him the Reason of it , because I had often seen him up early . Between 6 and 7 I saw him again , with something like a Bundle of Linnen under his Arm . Samuel Goodwin depos 'd , That the Prisoner and he went to Bed on Sunday Night about 12 . That at 6 the next Morning he got up , and went down Stairs , but came up again and laugh 'd , and said the Area-Doors were open . That the Prisoner being afterwards tax 'd with the Robbery , he deny 'd it ; and being asked if he had not been abroad that Morning , he declared he had been no farther than the Hay-market . That when he was in Prison , he told the Witness he had bought 14 Shirts for 10 Guineas , some of which his Sister had , but she was gone to Bristol . He desired him to beg of his Master not to hang but to transport him . The Witness added , that the Prisoner looked after the Horses , and used to bring the Keys of the Stables home to the House every Night . Mr Hardwick , Mr Grubb 's Neighbour , depos 'd , that he saw ( from his own Window ) the Prisoner in the Room where the Cabinet stood , between 5 and 6 that Morning , but could not see what he did there , because one of the Window-Shutters was put to . This Witness put brass Plates , above and below the Lock of the Cabinet , to secure it , and it was his Opinion the Flap was loosened with the Knife , till a Man 's Fingers could be got in , to pull it open . Jane Kelloway , the Maid , confirmed part of Goodwin 's Evidence . She told the Prisoner , if Thieves had got in at the Area-Door they were honest Rogues , for a Silver half-pint Mug was left upon the Dresser , where it stood the Night before . She added , that it was her Business to open the Parlour-Windows , and the Prisoner never did it but once ; and that he confessed to her , he was guilty with Regard to the Shirts , but was innocent of all the rest . Guilty 39 s. * * As the Prisoner 's Confession was made use of against him , as a Proof he stole the Shirts , the other Part of his Declaration , must likewise he admitted in his Favour ; wherein he denies taking the Money . And as two of the Shirts laid in the Indictent , were not Shirts , when taken by him , and one of the Shirts produced was not Mr Grubb 's , there was Proof only as to five Shirts . [ Transportation .
