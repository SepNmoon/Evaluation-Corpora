Thomas Dennis was indicted for stealing a Man 's Beaver Hat , val . 15 s. the Goods of William Brownjohn , in the Parish of St. Andrew Holborn , December 17 . William Brownjohn . I can only say , the Hat charged on the Prisoner in the Indictment , is mine . I took it upon this Witness . ( Benjamin How ) who told the Prisoner in my hearing , that he had brought him into a Premunire . He said , he could not help it , and own 'd he sold it , to How . Did not I buy it of you , says How ? Yes ; and I had it of a Boy in Chick-Lane , said the Prisoner , who asked me 3 d. for it ; but I snatch 'd it from him , and ran away with it . The Hat hung up against the Side of a Press in my Shop , and I miss 'd it from thence , the Night before . Benjamin How . The Prisoner came up into my Room one Night , - I ca n't remember the particular Time , and told me he had a Hat in pawn for a Shilling , and if I would give him Money to fetch it out , I should have it for a Shilling more : So I gave him one Shilling to redeem the Hat , and he sold it me out-right for another . I believe this is the same Hat I bought of the Prisoner . William Legg , Constable . The Prisoner and How were both brought before me the Night they were taken . How said in the Prisoner 's hearing , He bought the Hat of him , - and the Prisoner did not contradict him at all . Prisoner . I bought it of a Boy in Chick-Lane , who asked me 3 d. for it . I gave him 3 d. and carried it to Jemmy Birt at Com-Cross ; he pawn 'd it for me , and brought me a Shilling . The next Night I happened to be at this Ben How 's , and he wanting a Hat to wear on Christmas-Day , I offer 'd him this Hat , for a Shilling more than 't was pawn 'd for . I ca n't tell where the Boy is , who sold it to me , - but I am as innocent as the Child unborn . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 81,82.

William Maxwell was indicted for stealing a large Copper-bottom , wt . 1 C. and 6 lb . val . 5 l. the Goods of Benjamin Weale , in the Parish of St. Michael Woodstreet , December 15 . And , 84. Samuel Peartree , of St. Botolph Aldgate , was indicted for receiving the same , knowing it to be stole . Benjamin Weale . On Saturday December 15 . I lost from my Door , a Copper-bottom of an Hundred and odd Pounds Weight in the Evening ; and I sent among the Trade , to desire it might be stopp 'd , if it should be offer 'd to sale . On Monday the 17th of December , about 7 in the Evening a Messenger came from Houndsditch , to let me know he believ 'd he could give me Information about my Goods . Upon this I went to Mr. Simms , a Founder , in Houndsditch , and found about a third Part of the Copper-bottom in the Scales , in Order to be weigh 'd and sold . Mr. Simms 's Servants imagin 'd it was mine , so they delay 'd paying for it , and sent for me . My Servants , as well as I , being positive to the Goods , Mr. Simms told me he had order 'd Mr. Peartree ( who brought it ) to call again for the Money , and if we would go to a publick House , he would send for us when he came . My Servants ( Daniel Mardon and Henry Clark ) went accordingly , to an Alehouse in the Neighbourhood ; and about 8 o'Clock , we were all sent for ; we asked him how he came by the Goods ? He said , he had them from the Prisoner Maxwell , and that Maxwell told him , he had stole it from a Brasier 's Shop , in Woodstreet , and had brought it to him ( Peartree ) on Saturday in the Evening . I told Peartree , it was not in the same Shape , when it was stole . He said , no ; it was a whole Bottom when he receiv 'd it from Maxwell , but in Order to disguise it , he had cut it to Pieces , and had carried 2 thirds of it to one Trench , a Founder at the 5 Bells in Old-Bedlam , and had said them to him , for 10 Pence Half-penny a Pound . Upon this Information from Peartree , I got a Search-Warrant , and went next Morning to French , who deliver 'd me 70 lb . and a half of my Copper . On Thursday Evening Maxwell ( as I was inform 'd ) brought a Barrel of Raisins to Peartree 's House , and he was then taken . I was not present at that Time , but I was with him the next Morning before the Lord-Mayor , and heard him desire to be made an Evidence , for others he said were concern 'd with him . He ( Maxwell ) acknowledg 'd that he stole the Goods , one Burton ( not taken ) lent him a Hand up with it , to carry it off . Peartree was present at the Time when Maxwell made this Confession before my Lord-Mayor . Henry Jackson . I saw Money paid by my Mastes Peartree to Maxwell ; and He gave Barton half of it . I ca n't tell the Day of the Month , nor how much Money was paid ; but I heard Peartree tell them , he had but 8 Pence a Pound ; and some Money ( out of this ) he allow 'd for the Wast of the Copper . I remember this was the same Night that Peartree was stopp 'd at Mr. Simm 's Peartree is a Brass-Founder himself . - The common Price of Copper is about 10 d. 11 d. or 11 Pence Half-penny per Pound ; according to it 's Goodness . - The Value of this Copper ( I believe ) was about 10 Pence Half-penny , or 11 d. a Pound : But as there were some Nails in it . I reckon they made it a Half penny a Pound worse . I did not see the Goods brought in ; but I saw the Money paid to Maxwell , by Peartree ; and Maxwell told him , he brought it out of Woodstreet ; I knew not whose the Goods were , at that Time ; but I have since found , they were Mr. Weale 's in Woodstreet . Peartree . He knows I bought some Brass of him once before ; but I would ask him , if he can say , I knew of Maxwell 's going a-thieving ? Jackson . I know this , - I heard Maxwell tell him , that they went on in that Way . I have heard him tell him , he made a Thing so and so in such a Place . And I heard him tell Peartree , ( when he ( Peartree ) paid him the Money for the Copper ) that Burton would not carry it , it was too heavy for him , so he ( Maxwell ) was obliged to take it from the Door , and carry it off himself . Peartree . I would ask him if he knows I was privy to Maxwell 's Thieving ? Jackson . I do n't know that he was . George Watson . Peartree 's Mother informed me , that her Son ( the Prisoner ) had bought the Bottom of a Copper which was stolen from Mr. Weale , and she desired me to apprehend the Thief . Accordingly , I and another Person went to search for him , but could not find him . On the Evening of the same Day , she came to me , and told me , the Thief was then at their House . I went thither with a Friend , and we took the Prisoner Maxwell , at Peartree 's House , with a Barrel of Raisins , which he had carried thither . As soon as we had apprehended him , he desired to go before Sir Edward Bellamy , that he might be made an Evidence . He confessed the Fact , and that he had stole the Copper from Mr. Weale 's Door . He said Barton roll 'd it from Mr. Weale 's Window , and he ( Maxwell ) carry 'd it off . He told me the very Time , and the Day when it was done . There he stands at the Bar , and ca n't deny it . Peartree is my Neighbour : He has liv 'd 12 Years near me , and I never heard Harm of him . Jury , ( to Jackson , ) Do you know your Master us 'd to buy stolen Good ? Jackson . He has bought in that Way . - There has been many Goods brought into his House , which seem 'd to be unlawfully come by , and he has bought many such Things of them : but he began to call himself to Remembrance , and to be desirous to refrain from their Acquaintance . But as he had dealt with them before , he was afraid of coming into Trouble for refusing to receive their Goods . I have heard him say this : and that he did not care to buy any more Goods from them . He has dealt with them , in this Way , near three Quarters of a Year to my Knowledge . Jury . Have they told Peartree how they came by the Goods ? Jackson . Yes . They have told him how they came by them , and he has bought them notwithstanding . This Copper he bought of Maxwell , for 8 d. a Pound . Daniel Marden . On the 15th of last Month , about Dusk of the Evening , my Master lost a Copper-bottom from the Door . On the 17th a Messenger came from Mr. Simms , in Houndsditch , to inform him , there was such a Thing upon Sale , at his Shop . Henry Clark and I , went thither , and my Master ( Weale ) follow 'd . As soon as we saw the Copper , we knew it to be my Master 's . Mr Simms 's People told us the Man who brought it , was to come again for the Money , and they desired us to go and wait at an Alehouse , 'till he came . We went to a publick House ; and one of Mr. Simms 's Men came to us , about 8 o'Clock , and told us the Man was come for the Money . We went directly to Mr. Simms 's and found Peartree , the Prisoner , and Part of the Copper , which we had lost , in the Scale . I said my Hand upon it , and claim 'd it for my Master . Peartree stood on my right Hand , and said he belong 'd to it . Then , says I , I will take Care of you , and the Copper too . This is the Copper , and I swear 't is Part of my Master 's Bottom , which he lost . The Prisoner said , he had it from Maxwell , for 8 d. a Pound , and own 'd he had sold 70 th and a half to one Trench in Old Bedlam , and that he knew it to be stolen , at the same Time he sold it . I heard him own this , and that he had cut it to Pieces to raise Money on it , to pay the Rogues , Maxwell and Burton . Between one Tradesman and another , the Copper is worth 11 d. Half-penny a Pound : but we allow 12 d. a Pound for all that comes into our Shop . Peartree . Whereabout was it , I own 'd I knew It to be stole ? Marden . Both before Mr. Alderman Lambert , and my Lord-Mayor : and likewise in Mr. Simms 's Shop . Henry Clark confirm 'd the former Witness in every Circumstance : adding , that Peartree acknowledg 'd he was sensible the Goods were stole but as he had dealt with Maxwell and Burton before , they threaten 'd him , if he refused to dispose of their Goods . Peartree . I am sure if I said I knew it to be stole , I told a Lie . Maxwell . I own I stole it , and Peartree knew it was stole . James Gase . I have known Peartree from a Child . He is my Tenant , and has liv 'd by me several Years . He pays his Rent honestly , and seemingly works hard for his Living . Rise early or late , you always find him at Work . Geo Watson . I never heard any Harm of Peartree . I have known him about 2 or 3 Years . He 's a civil Neighbour , but in the way of buying stolen Goods , I ca n't be a Judge of that . - I know no Harm of him , but as I was inform 'd about his buying this Gentleman 's Effects . Robert Hewson . I have liv 'd in Peartree 's House , about 7 or 8 Years , but I knew him before he went 'Prentice . I never knew no Ill by him , and whenever I went in , or out , I always caught him in his Business . James Murray . I have known Peartree many Years , - from a Child ; but I know nothing of his Affairs . I ca n't say I have ever heard any Thing of his Dishonesty before this Fact . Both Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 85 . + Thomas Hawkins was indicted for assaulting Matth.ew Brown in a certain publick Street , and common Highway , in the Parish of St. Sepulchre , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Silver Watch , value 3 l. Dec. 30 . Matthew Brown . I had been to Hanover Square , last Sunday was a Fortnight , to see my Brother , and I staid with him , 'till between 6 and 7 in the Evening ; then I came directly homewards . It was a dismal cold Night , and very snowy , so I had a great Coat on with the Cape under my Hat , and pull 'd over my Face , and my Hands were wrapp 'd up in my Coat . As I came up Chick-Lane in my way Home , between 7 and 8 o'Clock , the Prisoner came out of an Alley , ( Thatch 'd Alley ) and gave me a Blow with his Fist , ( I believe ) which knock 'd me down . The Prisoner was the Man , and no Man else ; I am sure of it , for I took particular Notice of him . I fell down with the Blow , and the Prisoner fell upon me . We struggled together , and just as I got from him , he drew my Watch out of my Fob Pocket . I call 'd out Thieves ! but he ran away with the Watch into the Alley : I pursued him , and made two or three Strokes at him , but he got away , and ran into a House . As I ran down the Alley after him , I cry 'd Thieves ! Murder ! I am robb 'd of my Watch ! But 2 Women held out their Arms and stopp 'd me ; I gave one of them a Blow on the Breast and knock 'd her down ; then I ran past them and followed the Prisoner into the House . As soon as I got in , the Prisoner turn 'd himself round , look 'd me in the Face , and then laid himself down on a Bed , in the Ground Room . I charged him with taking my Watch , and would have taken him off the Bed , but some Men and Woman ( who were in the Room ) would not suffer me to take him . The Landlady of the House said , d - mn you , you Son of a Bitch , bring a Guinea or 20 Shillings and you shall have your Watch again To-morrow Morning . Says the Prisoner , ( who lay all this while on the Bed ) if the poor Man will bring 10 Shillings he shall have it again . I insisted upon having my Watch , or the Prisoner off the Bed , upon which they all fell a thumping me , and knock 'd me out of Doors . They would not let me have the Prisoner , but thump 'd me and beat me upon the Breast and under the Ribs , and turn 'd me out of the House . Then I call 'd out for Assistance , and a Soldier coming by , I told him a Thief was gone in there , who had robb 'd me of my Watch , and I would give him Half a Crown , if he would call a Constable . Another Soldier came up at the same Time , and bid me give 'em the Money first . I said , I would give them a Crown , as soon as they brought me an Officer , but I did not care to give 'em the Money before-hand . Upon this , they likewise began to thump me about : I told them I believ 'd they were all alike , and ran Home to my Wife : She saw I was very much frighted , and upon my telling her what had happen 'd , she advised me to go to Mr. Robinson , ( my Neighbour ) and by his Directions I got a Search-Warrant from Justice Wroth , and went with it that same Night to St.Sepulchre 's , where I got a Constable who went with me to the House , and took the Prisoner . I shew 'd him likewise , the Woman who bid me bring a Guinea or 20 s. if I would have my Watch again . I did not see the Prisoner when I first went in with the Constable ; but upon taking a Candle , and looking round the Room , I found him creeping round a Table , to get to the Door . I am positive I had the Watch in my Fob , when the Prisoner and I struggled together , and I saw it in his Hand , when he ran from me into the Alley . To the best of my Knowledge he put it in his Coat Pocket . Philip Price . Watchman . I know nothing of the Robbery , but as Mr. Brown had subscrib 'd ( de scrib 'd ) the Man , I call 'd the Constable , and we went and took the Prisoner , as he had subscrib 'd him , in Thatch 'd Alley , in Chick-Lane . He did not own the Fact himself , but there was a Woman went with us to the Pump Alehouse ( who pass 'd for the Prisoner 's Wife ) and she told us , that in case her Husband should not be prosecuted , she would produce Mr. Brown 's Watch . The Prisoner was present , and in the Hearing of this , but he said nothing at all to it . Prisoner . Ask him if he ever knew any Harm by me ? Price . I do n't know , - he lives with a Woman who makes it her Business to go a-whoring and thieving . I never knew him do any thing himself . He formerly was a Post-Boy , and used to ride post ; but he has liv 'd about a Year in these Alleys . Tho Cox . I have nothing to say , not I ; no farther than this : My Landlord ( Brown ) on Sunday was a Fortnight came home about 8 o ' Clock very much 'frighted , and said he had been knock 'd down in Chick-Lane , and had been robb 'd of his Watch , by a short thick fresh coloured Man , in a light colour 'd Coat , and that he should know him again from an Hundred . He asked me and my Bedfellow to go with him , to the House , and assist him in taking the Man . We agreed to go with him ; but we first went to Mr Robinson , ( our Neighbour ) and he sent us to Mr Justice Wroth , who order 'd us to go that Night , to the Watch-house , and take the Constable with us . When we had got a Constable , Mr Brown carry 'd us to the House where we found the Prisoner ; and as soon as we got in , Brown said , - this is the Woman that told me I should have my Watch To-morrow Morning , if I would bring her a Guinea , or 20 s. There was one Sarah Hawkins in the Room at the same Time , and she jump 'd up at the Constable , and said , - d - mn you , I 'll cut your Nose ; but he gave her a Thump on the Breast and said , - d - mn you , you B - ch , whose Nose will you cut ? Upon which she sat down and was quiet . We did not see the Prisoner when we first went into the Room , but Brown took a Candle , and found him creeping round a Table behind the Door , and gave the Constable charge of him for stealing his Watch . He deny 'd the Fact , but we carried him to the Counter that Night , and next Morning we had him before the Alderman at Guildhall , where he deny 'd the Fact again . Tho Allbrook gave exactly the same Account with the former Witness . Mr Roomer . Constable , Mr Brown came to me , and begg 'd I would assist him to take the Prisoner , who had robb 'd him of his Watch . I asked him how he lost it ? He gave me the same Account of the Robbery , as he has now done , and described the Prisoner . I bid him be cautious in what he was about , and asked him if any Women had been in his Company ? He told me , no ; and insisted upon it , that the Prisoner was the Man who robb 'd him , and no one else . Upon this I went with him to the House , and he charg 'd me with the Prisoner , who denied the Fact , both at that Time and before the Alderman ; but Mr Brown being positive to the Man , he was committed . DEFENCE . Robert Harrison . I came home , as near as I can guess , about 8 o'Clock , - nearer 8 than 7 , on Sunday before New Year 's Day , at Night : and coming home , I saw a Tumult about my Door in the same Alley . I ask 'd what was the Matter , and a Gentleman in a light colour 'd caped Coat , and in his own Hair , made answer and said , that the Bitches had robb 'd him of his Watch . I made answer again , - what Business had you in Bitches Company ? If you have been in Bitches Company , you must take Bitches doings . Then I knock 'd at my Door ; my Children open 'd it , and I went in . This is the Gentleman that made answer to me at the same Time . 'T is very true , - and God forbid I should take a false Oath . I have been a Tubman at Mr Dickenson 's Brewhouse these 30 Years , and my Friends before me . I deal there for Hundreds a Year , tho ' I am a poor Man . Martha Harrison . There were three of us sitting by the Fire that Night , and we heard a Noise in the Alley . A Man 's Voice said , I will give you half a Crown when I have done , and do you hold my Watch . Presently after I heard a Man say , you Bitch where 's my Watch ? The Woman said , indeed Sir I have not got it ; the other Woman has it . I do n't know who these Women were , for I was below in the Kitchen , and we did not come to the Door , 'till my Father , ( the former Witness ) knock 'd . Then I went out , and saw the Gentleman , in a caped Coat and his own Hair , and he was mussled up in his Cape , for fear any body should see him . I saw him turn up his Cape ; it was not done up when I came first out . This is the Man , ( pointing to Mr.Brown ) and he cried out Murder ! Good People of this House ! and knocked at our Window-Shutters , but we were afraid to answer . I did not hear him say any Thing about a Man , but presently after we heard a Woman cry out Murder , and People ran out to see what was the Matter . - I know the Prisoner to have been a Postman , but I do n't know how long he has lived in that House . The People of the House , are good honest People , as far as I know . We live next Door to them , but my Father and Mother are not People who go gossiping about to other People 's Houses . Mr Brown . I never saw a Woman all the Way in the Lane , till I was opposed in going after the Prisoner into the House , by two Women in the Alley ; and those Women I afterward saw in the House with the Prisoner : and they curs 'd and damn 'd me , and called me Son of a Bitch . These People did not appear when the Prisoner was carried on the Monday after the Robbery , to Guildhall . Elizabeth Ellis . I am 17 Years old , the 3d of June ; I was at Harrison 's House that Night , and heard a Bustling up the Alley , and heard a Man say , he would give half a Crown , and hold my Watch . I heard Women ; and by and by I heard the Man say , where 's my Watch ? A Woman said , indeed I have it not ; the other Woman has it . Then they cried out Murder , and the Neighbours came out to see what was the Matter . The Woman that got his Watch , ran away , and the Man ran up and down the Alley , - Where 's my Watch ! Where 's my Watch ! I 'll give 4 Crown for my Watch ! After Mr Harrison came home , I saw the Man ; this is he , in his own Hair : He had a whitish caped Coat on . William Blake . ( a Soldier . ) I and my Friend [ Houghton ] were drinking that Night at the Castle at Cow-Cross , and as we were coming home thro ' Black Boy Alley , we saw this Mr Brown have hold of the Prisoner , between 7 and 8 o'Clock . He said to me , Brother Soldier assist me , I have lost my Watch with two Women , and I believe this is the Man that has got it , but my Comrade and I went home directly , we would not trouble our selves about it . Jury . Do you lodge in the Prisoner 's House ? Blake . No , I quarter at the Bull and Butcher , at Cow-Cross . Thomas Houghton . I was with Blake at the same Time ; as we were coming thro ' Black Boy Alley , we heard a Noise : Blake asked what was the Matter ? The Gentleman said , he had been robbed of his Watch by two Women , and he would give us half a Crown to get a Constable , for he believed that Man had got it , and belonged to them : but we went away , and I went to my Lodgings at Westminster . I saw no farther , upon my Word , - if you 'll believe me . The Gentleman was a tall Man , with a caped Coat tucked round his Ears , in his own Hair . This is the Man . George Collins . Between 7 and 8 that Night , I heard a Noise of Women crying out Murder . - I live in Thatched Alley , - I am a Shoemaker . - I heard the Gentleman say , he had been robbed by two Bitches , and two Women . Several Times he expressed himself in that Manner . Jury . Do you live in the same House with the Prisoner ? Collins . Yes : and I am certain he was in the House , when the Man was robbed . There were several Men and Women too , in the Court , when the Noise of Murder was made . - The Prisoner was three Hours in the House before the Gentleman was robbed . I live one story higher than he . - I was sometimes above Stairs , and sometimes below . - I was in his Company just before the Man was robbed , and heard the Prisoner run out of the House , when he was complaining he had lost his Watch . I am sure the Prisoner was in the House from 4 to 8 , when the Outcry was made . - I was below Stairs , and sometimes I was ( perhaps ) half a Minute , not more , above Stairs . - No : I know nothing of any Wife of the Prisoner 's - I was not out of the House all Day , for I was ill of the Tiffick ; I sat below at their Fire , because it was cold , and was not above Stairs for above half a Minute . Elizabeth Oliphant . On Sunday Night after Christmas-Day , about 7 or 8 o'Clock at Night , I was going to the Pump Alehouse , for a Pot of Purl . - I live next Door to the Prisoner , in the same Alley , - Thatched Alley . The Prisoner was sitting at the Fire , when I went out for the Purl . I am sure I had been there all the Afternoon , for Elizabeth Carter ( the Landlady ) and I had join 'd for Tea . When I came back with the Purl , I heard Murder cry 'd in the Alley , and a Woman ran past me , by the same Token , she dash 'd the Pot of Purl out of my Hand . I asked what was the Matter ? The Woman that ran past me said , she did not know , and while I was asking about it , the Prisoner came running out of the House . I saw one Woman upon the Ground , and the Prosecutor too , with his Breeches down . I bid him get up , and put up his Breeches , for 't was very cold . Upon my Word 't is true : I never took an Oath before , in my Life . The Woman was upon the Ground , and her Cloak , - a dark colour 'd Cloak lay upon the Snow . The Prosecutor said , give me my Watch . The Woman upon the Ground said , the other Woman had got it . The Man 's Cloaths were all open , & c. and I bid him get up , the Weather was not so hot , that he should lie there in that Manner ; and if he wanted a Whore , I bid him go Home to his Wife , for he told us he had a Wife and Children upon Windmill-Hill . I ca n't tell who the Woman was , who lay upon the Ground , for I did not see her . - No , she got away while the Prosecutor was putting up his Cloaths . - She was none of us , - not one of our Neighbours , as I know of : and I am sure the poor Man at the Bar ran out of the House when Murder was cried , and that the Robbery was committed before he went out to see what was the Matter : for the Prosecutor was at that Time pulling open the Woman 's Breast , in a violent Manner ; and calling out , - where 's my Watch ! Upon which I told him the Weather was so cold , that I wanted something warm , and I bid him get up , and not lie there in the Snow . - No ; the Man was not quite down upon the Ground ; he only had one Knee down , and the other up , and I found him pulling open the Woman 's Breast , to see for his Watch . Elizabeth Carter , [ The Landlady . ] The Prisoner at the Bar lodged at my House : he has lived 2 Years with me . On Sunday Evening , before New-Tear 's Day , he and I were sitting by my Fire , by ourselves ; We sat together 2 Hours before the Outcry was made , and no one interrupted us . No Body came in , for 2 Hours before , - because 't was very cold , and it snowed very hard . But presently after , I heard Murder cried , very terribly : upon that the Prisoner run out of Doors , and I followed him : and at the Bottom of 2 Steps under Harrison 's Window , I saw the Gentleman that made the Noise , in his own Hair , and 2 Women with him . - Whether one of the Women was getting away , or not , I ca n't tell . But they struggled together ; They cried Murder , and be cried , give me my Watch . After I had seen this , I went in again , and sat down by the Fire . I am sure there were 2 Women with him : but People might be passing and re-passing . He stood struggling with the two Women , and I believe he had one of them by the Breast . He was not undressed then , for the Gentlewoman ( Oliphant ) says , he put up his Breeches before I got out of Doors . I am sure I heard the Consequence of the Thing , and then I ran in Doors again directly , but the Prisoner staid out in the Alley longer . The 2 Women were upright upon their Legs ; I did not see any of them on the Ground , for it snowed very hard . I am very sure the Prisoner and I had been together by ourselves , for 2 Hours before the Noise was made . I have Lodgers in the House indeed ; there was a Woman suckling a Child , and 2 other Women ; but they were all above , up one Pair of Stairs . Collins ( a former Witness ) lodges up 2 pair of Stairs , and he was above Stairs too . He ( Collins ) was but a very little Time with the Prisoner and me , below Stairs ; he was in his own Apartment , and did not stay above a Minute below Stairs ; he only came down , and took a Candle , and then he went up Stairs . He was not above a Minute with us . When the Prosecutor came afterwards with the Constable , he was asked [ by the Constable ] what he called him out of Bed for , to this poor Postman . - I believe the Prisoner has a Wife , - I do not know . - I do not know where she is . The Constable . When I apprehended the Prisoner there was not any Talk of this Kind : there was not one Word of a Squabble with Women . I asked Mr Brown if no Women had been concerned in the Robbery , and he said , no : he had not been in Company with any Women , but that it was the Prisoner alone , who knocked him down and robbed him : and when he charged me with the Prisoner , he ( the Prisoner ) never mentioned a Syllable of Brown 's having complained of being robbed by 2 Women . There was not one Word of this Defence , set up then . Mr Brown . As to these 2 Soldiers , I can not say I remember them : but there was a Soldier came up to the Door of the Prisoner 's House , and I offered him Money to get a Constable . Another Soldier came up afterwards , and I offered them a Crown , but they pushed me about , and beat me . Carter , the Landlady , ( the former Witness ) was the very Woman that punched me on the Breast , and said , d - mn you , you Son of a B - ch , bring me a Guinea , or 20 s. and you shall have your Watch , to-morrow Morning . Carter , [ the Landlady . ] Mine being the first Door which was opened in the Alley , the Prosecutor came in , and says he , God bless you , good People , can none of you tell me any Thing of these Women ? I will give you 10 s. if you can . I ran to the Door , to the Prosecutor , and said if you would give 10 s. or a Guinea , or ever so much , no one here can tell you any Thing of your Watch . He might as well take away my Life ; or any other poor Creature 's , as the Prisoner 's . He offered 10 s. for his Watch , and I said , if he would give 20 s. or a Guinea , or 10 Guineas , none there could help him to it . My Husband 's a Shoemaker , and I have a Child to Nurse , and do what I can to keep the Wolf from the Door . Philip Price ( Watchman ) . This Woman [ Carter ] keeps a common Bawdy-House , ( in Thatch 'd Alley ) and entertains all Manner of Whores and Thieves . We have several Times taken lewd People out of her House . The Constable knows it , as well as I . The Constable . I know Carter 's House , and have been several Times called to take Persons from thence . - 'T is a House of no Reputation at all . That Man ( Harrison ) is a Tubman , I believe him to be an honest poor Man : One of these Girls is his Daughter . The two Soldiers I know nothing of ; and as to Oliphant , I have seen her at Carter 's House several Times , and likewise about this Alley . How she gets her Living , I can not tell . William Lascells . I live at the Saracen's-Head , on Snow-Hill : I am Chamberlain there , and the Prisoner used to ride post from our Inn ; but we not having had Occasion for so many Postmen , as formerly , he was discharged . Since which he has come to the Postboy 's Room , which is on the left Hand of mine , and I have left my Door open , and have had 300 Pound's-worth of Money and Goods therein , but I never lost any Thing . He went by the Name of Dumplin ; and Gentlemen who used to ride post , enquired for him by the Name of bonest Dumplin , and have said , he was the honestest Postboy that ever they rid with in their Lives .

Thomas Barnes . On Saturday the 15th of December , about 11 o'Clock at Night the Prisoner came into my House , and called for a Pint of Beer . He sat in the Fore-Room , but he came once or twice into the Kitchen , where Company were drinking out of this three pint Tankard . I saw the Prisoner in the Kitchen myself , but I was called up Stairs to take a Reckoning , and when I came down , the Company were all gone out of the Kitchen , except the Prisoner , and one other Person . The Prisoner threw down three Halfpence for his Pint of Beer ; wished me a good Night , and went out . I am positive the Tankard was in the Kitchen when I went up Stairs ; and after the Prisoner was gone , I miss 'd it , and enquired after it ; and suspecting him , I went to his Lodging , but could not find him : so I advertis 'd it , and on the Tuesday following Mr Nichols near Aldgate , sent for me ; I went to him , and found the Body of my Tankard ; the Prisoner was in Mr Nichols 's Back-Parlour , and seeing the Tankard without the Handle , I asked him what was become of that ? He pulled it our of his Pocket , and gave it to me directly . This is the Tankard , and this the Handle , and it has my Mark upon it . I told the Prisoner I was sorry he should be guilty of such an Action ; and he fell down on his Knees and asked Forgiveness of me , before Mr Nichols . Mr Nichols . The Tankard having been advertised on Monday and Tuesday , and the Prisoner coming to my Shop on Tuesday to offer the Body of the Tankard to Sale , I asked him how he came by it ? He bought it ( he said ) of one he knew very well . I told him , he had best find out the Person he bought it of , else he would come into Trouble . I asked him , what he gave for it ? He said , it cost him 20 Shillings . That 's worse and worse , said I ; for if you buy Things , and do n't give the full Value , you will suffer on that Account . He appeared at that Time very genteel ; he was well dressed , in a powdered Wig , and white Stockings ; but I kept him in my Back-Room , till I sent for Mr Barnes : he owned it , and the Prisoner was detained in the Counter that Night . The next Morning Mr Alderman Westley committed him . He told Mr Barnes he was sorry for what he had done ; he hoped he would forgive him , and pulled the Handle of the Tankard out of his Pocket , and gave it to him . This is the Tankard , and this the Handle ; they are worth about 6 l. Guilty of the Felony , but acquitted of the stealing out of the Dwelling-House . [ Transportation .

On the 15th of December in the Morning , when I went to the Church , I missed the Nossels and the Brass Arms from the Branches . Eight Nossels , 8 Cups and Bosses , and a Brass Arm were gone . I asked our Watchman what was become of them ? He could not tell ; so I went away to Mr Giles , our Founder , and desired him to make Enquiry after them . About an Hour afterward , I heard some of the Things were found , and being produced before my Lord Mayor , I knew them and owned them ; and as the Prisoner was carrying to Goal , I asked him for what was wanting ? He told me he had sold some of the Brass at the Sign of the Bell in Long-Lane . I went thither , but the Man of the House denied he had bought any such Thing , upon which we carried the Prisoner to him , and then he owned he had bought the Brass of him , and gave us what was wanting . Prisoner . I did not take them ; they were given me to sell . Mr Rowden . He made no such Pretence when we took him ; but he acknowledged he concealed himself in the Church all Night , and that he went to work in the Night , and took the Things , which he carried out in the Morning .

Guilty Death . 89 . + Elizabeth Fletcher was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , Value 40 s. from the Person of John Banks , January 7 . Mr Banks . On the 7th of this Instant January at Night , I was going to the upper Part of Moorfields . When I came to Fore-Street , in my way thither , I saw it was half an Hour past 8 . When I had passed thro ' Moor gate , I stopped to make Water . While I stood against the Wall , the Prisoner came up , and accosted me with such obscene Language , as I believe will be improper to mention in this Place , the Substance of it was , to ask me whether I would lie with her ; and at the same Instant , she put one Hand under my Cloaths , and pulled them up to my Stomach , and with the other Hand , she forcibly took my Watch out of my Fob . As soon as ever I had put my Cloaths in order , I pursued her , and took her by the Crown Alehouse ; she was carried in there , and was searched , but we could not find the Watch . 'T was a Silver Watch , with a Coat of Arms , and a Motto on it ; with a Key and Seal thereto . Mr Spearing assisted me , and the Prisoner was carried to the Counter , for I was positive she took it . I looked to see what a Clock it was , between the Castle Alehouse and the Globe Tavern , and when I stopped to make Water , and took up my Cloaths , the Chain of the Watch , struck against my Hand ; after which there was neither Man , Woman , nor Child near me , 'till the Prisoner came up , and took it . Prisoner . What Time o'Night was it when you saw your Watch ? Mr. Banks . It was half an Hour past 8 . Prisoner . Was it not dark ? Mr Banks . It was partly Moonlight , and something lighter , by Reason of the Snow , and there was the Light of the Lamps besides . I am positive the Prisoner is the Person who took my Watch . I felt her take it ; she hurt me with one of her Hands in taking it ; and I felt it slip away ; but the Weather had made the Ground so slippery , that I could not run very fast after her ; and when I pursued her , she walked faster than I could ; else I had laid hold of her sooner . Prisoner . What was said to you by the Person that took your Watch , when she left you ? Mr Banks . By the Prisoner 's attempting to take my Watch , she made me drop one of my Gloves : So I bid her go along , and told her she had made me drop my Glove : upon which she very courteously stooped down to pick it up , and in so doing she took my Watch . I am subject to the Gravel , and could not make Water and lay hold of the Prisoner at the same Time . Prisoner . Did you tell me when I had given you your Glove , that you had lost your Watch ? Mr Banks . No . Prisoner . Had I been in any Company after you lost your Watch ? Mr Banks . No : She was never out of my Sight , 'till I took her . But I am informed that these Creatures have a very particular way of concealing such Things . She was searched by two Women , and it was not found . Prisoner . How far distant , was the Place where I was searched , from the Place where you lost your Watch ? Mr Banks . The one was at Little Moorgate , and the other at Great Moorgate . When I laid hold of her , she was stooping down , and said she was tying her Garter . She did not stoop down till she saw me near her . When I charged her with the Fact , she called me base Man ; but I am positive she took it out of my Fob-Pocket . Prisoner . Last Monday was se'en-night about 2 o'Clock , a Gentlewoman called upon me at my Lodgings in Upper Moorfields , and told me Mrs Bragg had got a Child 's Coat for me to make . I cleaned myself , and went with her to Mrs Bragg 's in St. Thomas Apostles , about 3 . I staid and drank Tea , and after that I staid to Supper , and we had Mutton Chops . At 8 o'Clock I came out to go Home , and Mrs Bragg came with me to Little Moorgate , where I stopped to tie up my Garter , and then the Prosecutor came up and told me he had lost his Watch , and carried me into the Alehouse . There was a Woman in the Bar , and 2 Women were with her , who carried me into a Room and searched me , but found nothing upon me . The Woman of the House , asked him , why he brought me in there ? He told them he did not bring me in , but seeing me go in , he followed me . Amelia Watts . I went that Night to the Crown Alehouse ( Mr Hutton 's ) for a Pot of Beer , and heard a Woman crying in the little Room , Sir , you are not to beat me . I did not see the Gentleman beat hear , but I heard him say he had lost his Watch . Where did you lose it , says I ? 'T is lost in the House ( said he ) for ought I know , and I will make them find it . I did not hear any Thing of it 's having been lost out of his Pocket , nor of the Woman 's having been searched . Elizabeth Broadwater . The Prisoner makes my Children 's Coats , and I have employed her for my Friends ; I know no Ill of her : She has always used me with Sincerity and Handsomness . I keep my Father 's House , and he has a Place at Blackwell-Hall : I have known her 4 Years , and she gets her living this Way , and I am sure she follows her Business close , to get a Livelihood . Mary Linton . I have known the Prisoner about 6 Years . I have laid her of 2 of her Children , one of them is about 2 Years old , and the other is almost 4 . I believe she has good Business and keeps her Family as an honest Woman . Her general Character is , that she is a very honest Woman . Mary Woodward , John Payd , and - Crampton gave the Prisoner a good Character . - Bragg . On the Saturday before Twelfth-Day , Mrs Pain desired me to send the Prisoner to her about a Child 's Coat . Accordingly I went to her , on Twelfth-Day , ( the 7th of January ) about 2 o'Clock , and told her Mrs Pain 's Business . The Prisoner put on a clean Gown , and went with me to Mrs Pain 's , and we staid there till 8 o'Clock ; then we came out together , and I left her at Little Moorgate , and kept strait on my self towards Whitechapple I have known her Years , and never heard her Character blasted in my Life . - Pain . The Prisoner was at my House the 7th of January , between 2 and 3 o'Clock , with Bragg , and they staid till about 8 o'Clock , I had desired Bragg to send her to me , to make a Coat . I have employed her , and have helped her to Customers , and was surprised when I heard of this Accident . They drank Tea with me , and eat a Mutton-Chop , and it being Twelsth-Night , I pressed them to stay longer . Mr Banks gave an Account of his having been offered 20 l. or a Watch that ran upon Diamonds , to stisle the Prosecution ; and Mr Caleb Rophey deposed that he saw a Watch delivered into Mr Banks 's Hands ( not the Watch he lost ) for this Purpose : but neither of them , could take upon them to say , these Proposals were made with the Prisoner 's Privity or Consent . Mr Banks added , that he had heard the Prisoner had a bad Character , and said she was well known when she was committed ; that he heard she had lately served a Countryman in the same Manner , and had been at the Old-Bailey before , for such an Offence .

Mr Gibbon . On Sunday the 16th of December I was robbed of every Thing mentioned in the Indictment , while I was at Church . I locked my Buroe in the Morning before I went out , and ordered my Servants to go to the Chapel before the Service began . The Prisoner had been my Servant , and having been discharged for using me ill , I concluded he was the Person who had robbed me . I lost 3 Five-Guinea Pieces , 4 Two Guinea Pieces , and above 20 Guineas . Some Pieces of Portugal Gold ; a 3 Pound 12 Shilling-Piece in particular , some Crown-pieces and gilt Six-pences , and a Piece of Gold of King Charles the Second , and a Piece of Chrystal cut for a Seal ; some Mourning Rings , one pretty remarkable , because it hath not the Age of the deceased . Four of them are in the Indictment , but I lost more . The Prisoner was taken up in Essex , and the Things ( taken from him ) were described to me by the Constable , and afterwards were shewn me in Chelmsford Goal ; when I had seen them , they were sealed up again in my Presence , and are here in Court . Here is a Two-Guinea Piece , which has a Mark on it , whereby I am pretty sure I can distinguish it from another . This Piece of King Charles 's I believe is mine ; and I verily believe this Guinea is mine . Here is the Ring that wants the Age of the Deceased . This is the Seal , and here is the Impression which I took off about two Years ago . The Prisoner has confessed the Fact , and the next Witness will inform you , the Things were found upon him . They were taken out of my Scrutore in my Study ; the Lock of the Scrutore I found broke , and the Spring likewise , ( tho ' very strong ) and part of the Molding that went over the Lock . John Wasket . I took the Prisoner on the 30th of December , at Dunmow in Essex , and I found all these Things upon him , which are now Produced in Court . I am sure they are the same I found upon him . Daniel Monk . On the 30th of December I received a Warrant from Colonel De Veil , backed by Mr Justice Price of Illford , by Virtue of which we took the Prisoner . Upon searching him , we found the Things which have been now produced , and I heard him confess that he was guilty of the Fact , and that they were his Master 's . After he had said this , he told us the Things were given him by one John Linsley . John Dawson . On the 16th of December last , the Prisoner came and knocked at my Master 's ( Mr Gibbon 's ) Door ; I opened it , and his Brother William was with him . The Prisoner asked me , if my Master was gone to Church , and if we were going to Chapel ? I told him yes . Then I went in to put on my Shoes , and when I came back I did not see the Prisoner . I asked his Brother William , where he was gone ? William told me , he was gone out to speak to a Gentleman 's Servant in the Yard . I left them both in the Passage , just within the Door , when I went to put on my Shoes . Jury . How far was this Passage from your Master 's Study ? Mr Gibbon . The Stairs which go to the Study , were in this Passage . Dawson . The Study is up one Pair of Stairs . William staid but a very little Bit ; we went to Chapel , and he went out before us . John Clark . I made the Book Case for Mr Gibbon , which was afterward broken open . Mr Gibbon called upon me , and told me of this Disaster , - the Accident which had happened to my Work , and I called the next Day at his House , and saw it had been broke open . The Lock of the Desk had been very much strained ; this is the Lock , and here is the Mark of the Instrument , with which it had been opened . Part of the Molding upon the Book-Case was tore off , to get at the Lock , and I reckon it must take up about a Quarter of an Hour , ( not much less ) in the breaking open . Mr Gibbon . When Mr Clark saw it , it was in the same Condition as I found it . Colonel Price produced the Prisoner 's Confession , but as the Prisoner had sworn it , it was not read . Mr Ellis . I went to Chelmsford Goal to see the Prisoner . The Things which have been now produced , were found upon him , and he owned they were Mr Gibbon 's . Mr Wasket . I heard him own in Chelmsford Goal , that the Things found upon him were Mr Gibbon 's , and that Linsley gave them to him . Mr Gibbon . Some of the gilt Sixpences , I am informed he and his Brother paid away in the Country . Wasket . Mr Gibbon wrote to me , and desired me to get up these Sixpences if I heard of any being put off , and I went accordingly and gave Change for some which the Prisoner 's Father had paid away for Half-Guineas ; but I do n't know of the Prisoner 's putting them off himself . Prisoner . I had all these Things , ( which Mr Wasket took upon me ) from John Linsley . Guilty , Death . 94.

I keep a Hosier 's Shop , in Little Suffolk Street ; I lost a Bundle of Stockings containing nine Pair , out of my Shop Window . - 'T is a close Window , and I put them there my self but a little while before they were stole . I missed them the 17th or 18th of November . William Wevlin . Styles , Pattison and I , on the 18th November , stole nine Pair of worsted Stockings ; ( some of them had red Clocks , and some of them white ) we stole them out of Mr Ridler 's Shop-window in Little Suffolk Street , near Great Suffolk Street , in the Haymarket . Styles ( being the biggest Man ) went into the Shop for a halfpenny worth of blue Thread , and stood before Mr Ridler . I stood at the outside of the Window to watch , and Pattison whipp 'd in , and took the Stockings , while Mr Ridler reached down a Bundle of Thread . When Pattison was got out of the Shop with the Stockings , he gave them to me ; I had Pattison 's great Coat on at that Time , and I clapped them under the left Side of the Coat , and he and I went to the Corner of the next Street , and waited 'till Styles came up to us . Then we all three went to Margaret Ellis 's , in Parker 's Lane , and went up into her one Pair of Stairs Room : she came up to us there , and bid us 7 s. for them all . While we were talking to her , Styles snatched up four Pair out of the nine , and ran down Stairs with them . Out of what was left , I had three Pair , and Pattison had two . My three Pair I sold to Ellis for 3 s. but Pattison said , he would not sell his at any such Price , he would sooner pawn them . - We all went out with a Design to get what we could get , and seeing these Stockings lie in a Bundle in the Window ready at Hand , we agreed that Styles should go in for a halfpenny worth of Thread , and stand before Mr Ridler , while Pattison whipp 'd away the Bundle . Ellis ( the Prisoner ) knew us before this Time ; Pattison and I , lodged in her House , and we used to go out every Night , and what we got we used to carry to her . She knew how we came by the Goods we brought her , and that we had stole these Stockings in particular . Pattison . There was no Body in this Robbery but the Evidence ( Weblin ) and I . We were coming that Night thro ' Leicester Fields , and meeting Jemmy Styles , we asked him to pawn some of these Stockings . He refused , because he was afraid they were not honestly come by : Upon which Weblin was angry , and said he 'd be up with him . I undid the Prosecutor 's Door myself . I have often opened it . We took these Goods while the Prosecutor and his Wife were drinking Tea . Pray , Sir , have not you often found your Shop Door open ? Mr Ridler . Yes I have . Pattison . 'T was I that opened it . We carried these Stockings to one Bess Cane , alias Bess Price , and she bid us 9 s. for them . Ellis . I had neither Act nor Part in this Matter , nor have I ever bought any Stockings since I came to London . I happened to take this Bess Cane into the House , and she brought the Gang about me . My dear Husband is dead in Goal , upon this Account , and I hope you 'll take my Case into Consideration . Jury to Ridler . Do you remember any such Person as Styles , who came to you for a halfpenny worth of Thread at that Time ? Ridler . I remember serving a Man with a Skain of Blue Thread , but I ca n't swear it was the Prisoner Styles . I never had my Goods again , nor did I ever hear any Thing of them , 'till I had Information from Colonel De Veil , that the Persons who robbed me , were taken , upon Weblin 's Information .

The Night the Hoops were taken , I saw the Prisoner watching about Mr Trueman 's Gate . He looked out at the Wicket , and had the Hoops ready .

Alexander Gordon . I was at my Master White 's when the Deceased and Cheatham went out together . In two Minutes Time he came back and said , Samuel ( the Deceased ) was killed , and the Man who killed him was gone down the Road . At Cheatham 's Desire , I went down the Road , and passed the Place where the Deceased lay , without looking at him . When I came to the Sign of the Coach and Horses , I saw the Prisoner , and seized him . He made a Punch at me , and said I was not a proper Officer , - I should not hold him . But I held him , and told him he should find me Officer proper enough to do it . Thomas Williams , Surgeon . On the 21st of December , about two o'Clock , I was sent for to view the Deceased . I found a small Contusion on the left Temporal Muscle . In the Cranium , and between the Membranes of the Brain , and the Cerebellum , there was a large Quantity of coagulated Blood . Upon dividing the Membranes of the Brain , I found about two Ounces more , which I take to have been the immediate Cause of his Death . I am apt to think these Appearances were occasioned more by the Fall than by the Blow ; and that the Blow could not have caused so violent a Concussion , as to have produced so much coagulated Blood . Thomas Makewell , Constable . On Wednesday the 19th of December , Cheatham fetched me to the Coach and Horses , to take charge of a Man , who had killed another . I went thither and found the Prisoner ; but before I would take charge of him , I went to see the deceased . I found him lying along , with his left Temple bloody . Then I went back to the Prisoner and said , - poor Man , I am sorry to take you into Custody , but I must bring you to Justice , - the Man is dead , - and so I carried him before Colonel De Veil . Alexander Gordon . Not above half an Hour before this Accident happened , the Deceased listed up an Anvil upon the Block , of 2 Hundred Weight . Prisoner . The Deceased had robbed me of half a Guinea , and 3 s. and meeting him that Day in Tyburn Road , I told him it was very hard he should rob the Spittal , and use me ill ; who had been so good a Friend to him . He said he would pay me at some Rate or other , and desired me not to hurt him . I told him I would not hurt him , but Justice should , and so I endeavoured to lay hold of him , we struggled together , and he struck me twice , and I believe I hit him a Blow in the Face ; a Child of 2 Years old might have stood against it , but upon this Blow he slipped down , on the Paved-Stones , and fell with his Head against a Step . I thought the poor Man had been in a Fit ; I am as innocent of designing to murder him , as the Child unborn . Brian Dean , William Birt , Francis Waeker , Thomas Cheney , Robert Sidney , and Francis How , gave the Prisoner the Character of a quiet Man , not addicted to Cruelty ; and some of them said , the Deceased was a wicked , poor Wretch .

John Threlkeld . I suppose ( Gentlemen ) I may be admitted to give an Account in full , from the Beginning to the Conclusion of the Fact . It was the 2d of December last . I was in Company with my Spouse , and was returning Home from a Visit at a Relation 's House , about 10 o'Clock in the Evening ; and turning into Swan-Alley , we did not see many People walking , but yet we had no Suspence about being attacked , but as soon as we had got into the Alley , 2 russian-like Men entered , and came forward . They hurried , and whispered , which made me imagine they had some evil Design . My Dame was about 20 or 30 Yards before me , and they passed her , and me too . When I had overtook her , I asked her , if they had offered any Violence to her . She told me , no . I dare say ( said I ) they are ill-designing Men , and just as I had changed the Words with her , the Prisoner came behind me , ( I heard his Step ) and he forcibly pulled off my Hat and Wig , and ran cross the Way , and pushed under a Gate-way . He was about 3 Score or a Hundred Yards from me , but 2 Men coming down the said Alley , Passage , or Lane , clapped upon him . It was a Moon-shine-Night , and I never lost Sight of him , from the Time he took my Goods , till he was taken . He had then the same Cloaths on , that he has now , and I am sure he 's the Man . One of the Witnesses took my Hat out of his Hand ; the Wig he dropp 'd near the Place where he made the Assault ; I saw it , and passed it to follow him . But my Hat being taken upon him , I said it was mine , and it was return 'd to me . Then we brought him down into a broader Place , and I found he had been bred up in the Neighbourhood , for the People came thronging out of their Houses , and said , - Ah ! young Graves ! you 'll never leave off these Practices ! When I heard he had been an old Offender , I was fearful of prosecuting him ; some People bid me give him a Kick in the Arse , and let him go , but I could not tell what to do . I am positive he 's the Man , I should know him , if it was 7 Years hence . Prisoner . What did I say to you when I was stopped ? Threlkeld . He said , Indeed , Sir , I took you for one of my Acquaintance : Now this to be sure was very odd , because I cried out stop Thief , several Times , as he was running away . Prisoner . What Time o'Night was it . Threlkeld . Rather before 10 than after . I was a-bed before 11 , and I had near three Quarters of a Mile to go Home . Prisoner . David Nix perswaded him to prosecute me . Threlkeld . As to the Nature of his being apprehended and taken , that may be farther declared , and that the Prisoner has been an Evidence already . I know it from his own Confession , before the Magistrate . He made a Declaration of many Things , which the Justice said he would not take Advantage of . He insisted on being made an Evidence . David Nix . I heard a Gentleman about 10 o'Clock at Night cry stop Thief ! So I turned my self round , and saw the Prisoner run down the Passage , with a Hat in his Hand ; upon which I laid hold of him , and said , Sirrah ! I believe you have robbed the Gentleman ! I took the Hat from him , and when the Gentleman came up , I asked him , if it was his Hat ? He said yes , and he would swear to it . I told him , he might let the Fellow go , now he had got his Goods ; but he bid me told him , and I did so , 'till the Mob rose and rescued him from me . - Nix . When my Brother Nix laid hold of the Prisoner , he had one Hat on his Head and another in his Hand . I said , Sirrah ! this is the Man 's Hat . The Prisoner immediately begged for God Almighty 's Sake we would let him go , else he was a dead Man . He has been an Evidence before . Guilty of the Stealing , but acquitted of that Part which charged the Prisoner with privately taking from the Person . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 117. Mary Pangborne was indicted for stealing a Pound and half of Tea , Value 15 s. the Goods of Elizabeth Ashboner , November 28 . Acquitted . 118. Thomas Nicholls of St. Catherine Cree-Church was indicted for stealing a Silver Mustard-Caster , Value 50 s. the Goods of the Provost and Fellows of Oriel College , in Oxford , December 11 . John Peters . About the 20th of November last , two Silver Casters were lost out of Oriel College Hall . One was a Pepper-Caster , and the other a Mustard-Caster , with a Mustard-Spoon in it . I missed them when I came to lay the Cloth for Supper , and enquired if they had not been taken to some of the Gentlemens Chambers , but could not get any Intelligence of them . This Caster I brought up from College with me , to compare with what we had lost . I know it belonged to the College . Dr. Hodges is Provost . The Proprietors are called by the Names of the Provost and Fellows of Oriel College in Oxford . Prisoner . Do you know I stole them ? Or can you say you saw me in the College . Peters . I know he belongs to Oxford : He work 'd at a Cutler 's Shop , by the King's-Head-Tavern , and after that he kept a little Shop of his own , in the Butcher-Row , I ca n't remember that I have seen him about the College . Samuel Nicholls . On the 11th of December , about 11 at Noon , the Prisoner came to my Shop , in the Parish of Cree-Church , and offered this Caster to Sale ; 't is filed both above and below the Swage . I asked him how he came by it ? He said he dealt about the Countries , in Silver and Hard-ware , and that he bought it in Oxfordshire , about 50 Miles off , - at a little Town in Banbury Parish . I asked him who he knew there ? But when he found I knew the Country , he would say no more , only that he gave 40 s. for it , and paid a Crown an Ounce . I looked upon the Bottom , and saw the Weight engraved on it , 9 Oz . 3 qrs . Upon this I had him before Sir John Thompson , who committed him , and bound me to prosecute . I intended to have advertised it , but the next Morning I put it in the Fire to try an Experiment , by which we often find out the Marks which have been filed out . When it was red hot , the Place where the Arms of the College had been , was as black as my Hat , and I could plainly perceive , 3 Lyons passant , and Orie-Col . I informed Mr. Robinson of this , and he advised me to write to Sir John Boyce of Oxon ; which I did , and described the Caster . On Saturday following , I received a Letter from Mr. Bentham of Oriel-College , and he wrote me Word , that the College and the World were obliged to me for my Information ; that they had lost such a Thing , and that he had wrote to Mr. Noel , of St. Katherine Cree-Church , to wait on me , and take proper Measures for bringing the Criminal to Justice . This Caster which has been sent up , was made at the same Time with the other , and has the same Marks upon it . On my Oath , I believe the Marks , which have been taken out of this Caster , were the same which are upon this , which is produced from the College . The Piercing is the same , and the Date of the Year likewise . After the Prisoner was committed , Mr. Noel and I went to him in Prison , but he would give no Account how he came by it . He told us , he knew well enough what to say when he came on his Trial . Prisoner . I go about the Countries , and sell Silver Buttons and Hard-ware with a Licence : I bought this Thing of a Man , who seeing I had Silver-Buttons and Tea-Spoons in my Box , he offered me this Caster , and I bought it of him for 50 Shillings . Peters . I know nothing of the Prisoner 's Character myself ; but before I came up , the Provost and Fellows ordered me , before I came up to London , to enquire into his Character of those who knew him ; but I could not find any one who would give him a good one . He had left his Shop , and the Town , when I went to enquire after him . Acquitted . 119.

Dec. 2 . Mary Bockcomb . On Sunday , December 2 , about 11 o'Clock at Night , I went to Bed , and left my House safe : when I came down Stairs on Monday Morning about 8 , I found the Sash up ; the Window-Shutters open about a Nail of a Yard , and a Silver Watch , a Velvet Hood , 3 Shirts , a Cambrick Apron , and a Piece of Pork were gone . I am positive the Sash was down , and the Shutters were close when I went to Bed , but by Accident , the Pin was not put in the Shutters . When I went to Bed , I took the Piece of Pork out of the Cupboard , and put it upon a Corner Table , by Way of Security against the Mice ; and the Pork was taken away , but a Silver Spoon , which was in the Dish with the Pork , was left . This made some of my Neighbours suspect the Lad , ( the next Witness ) because he is near-fighted , and they imagined he either did not see the Spoon , or that it was Silver . When the Boy was taken , he confess 'd the Fact , and among the Things taken , he mentioned a Pair of Stockings , which I did not miss , till he told me of them . Henry Bentley . The two Prisoners went with me to this Woman 's House in Newtoner 's Lane , and the Window-Shutters towards the Street , being neither pinn 'd nor key 'd , I took a Shutter down ; then I lifted up the Sash and went in , between three and four in the Morning . They both stood close to the Window to take the Goods in their Aprons . - I have been in Trouble five Weeks about this Affair . - After I was first taken , I made my Escape , and was concealed under the Prisoners Bed for several Days , and then I was retaken . - The Watch ( which I took out of a Drawer ) and three Shirts I gave Sargeway through the Window , into her Apron . Taverner took the Velvet Hood , and Stockings , and the Piece of Pork , into her Apron . Then I got out through the Window , and went Home with them , and we all went to Bed together , and eat the Pork in Bed , without any Bread . In the Morning Taverner was called up , by one Kelley , to go to BillingsGate , and when she came back , Sargeway tied up three Shirts , two Aprons , the black Velvet Hood , and the Pair of Stockings , in a Handkerchief , and carried them out . When she returned , she said she had pawned them for 6 s. and 6 d. but she would not tell me where she had pledged them . I was left a-Bed , while they went out to pawn these Things , and they gave me 3 s. out of the 6 s. and 6 d. As to the Watch , I told the Prisoners I believed I could sell it ; and I carried it to one John Anderson , a Painter , in Church-Lane , and left it with him to sell for me ; but the Day following he told me , he believ 'd it was stole , and he said he would give it the Headborough , that it might be advertised ; but he never did , for as soon as I was found out , and and taken up , he went off the Ground with it . Prisoners . Can you say we went with you to Mrs Backcomb 's House ? Bentley . I had knowledge of the House , and that the Shutters were not pinned . I told them of it , and the 2 Prisoners and I made an Agreement to go thither , at a House which we frequented in the Coal-Yard . Prisoners . How came we to give you 3 s. when you say we had but 6 s. 6 d. among us all ? Bentley . They told me they could get but 6 s. 6 d. upon the Things , but I believe they got more ; for Taverner , when she carry 'd them out , had an old dirty blue Cloak on , and in about 2 Hours after she had pawn 'd them , she had got a good whitish Cloak , and new Stockings on . Taverner . I know nothing of the Robbery . I went to Bed that Night about 9 o'Clock , and got up about 5 in the Morning , to go to Billingsgate for Fish , as I used to do . When I came Home again , there was a Hubbub , about the Boy ( Bentley 's ) being found in the Room . We had no Lock to our Door , and any Body might get into the Room . Mrs. Bockcomb . She says there was no Lock to the Prisoner 's Room : When I went thither , I desired the Prisoners to let me go in , and search the Room . Taverner gave me 2 Keys , but neither of them would open the Door , upon which , my Servant got a Story-Ladder , and went in at the Window ; then he opened the Door , but they found nothing , except the Pork-bones , which I believe were mine , - they were like mine . Prisoners . Was you in the Room yourself ? Backcomb . No . Sargeway . Before we should have taken the 3 Shirts to have pawned , surely we should have pawned the Watch ; - He is a Boy that has robb 'd all the Neighbourhood . They gave him a little Victuals out of Charity , at Mr. Russel 's where I wash , and he said there , he would hang his Father and Mother , before he would be hanged himself . He 's a vile , cruel Creature . Thomas Russel . I took the Evidence on Suspicion of robbing me , and delivered him to the Prosecutrix ; He has a bad Character , all over the Neighbourhood . When I took him , I asked him what he had done with Mrs. Bockcomb 's Things ? He told me he knew nothing at all of the Robbery . I have known Sargeway about 2 Years , and my Wife has entrusted her to wash Linnen ; I do n't know she ever wrong 'd me of a Farthing . As to Taverner , she lives in the Neighbourhood , and goes to Billingsgate for Fish , I know no Harm of her . While I was searching for the Boy , they never offered to go out of the Way . Bentley . I know this Man , to be as vile a Fellow as ever came before your Lordship .

Mary Harold . I wash Linnen , for several Persons . On the 24th of December , I left a Bundle , ( with the several Things in it , which are mentioned in the Indictment ) at Mrs. Hibbin 's Shop in Fenchurch-street , while , I went to another Customer , for more Linnen . When I returned , the Bundle was gone . [ The Witness recounted the Things in the Bundle , and named the Proprietors . ] Mrs. Hibbin not knowing what was become of them , I advertised them , in the News-Papers ; after which the 2 Prisoners were taken , and one of the Shirts which I had lost , [ and was Mr. Cartwright 's ] was taken upon Eakins 's Back ; it was taken off , before the Justice , and Madam Cartwright own 'd it , I knew it by the Mark I put on it before I put it into the Wash . Since this , we have found several other Things , which I know were in the Bundle , when it was taken away . Here 's a Pair of Sheets , but I ca n't be so positive to them , as I am to this Table-Cloth . Mrs. Cartwright . I can swear to the Sheets . Eakins . I would ask her , if she did not say she could not swear to the Shirt , that was found upon me ? Harold . I said I could not swear to a Shirt upon a Man 's Back ; but when it was pulled off , I saw my red Mark on it , and was positive to it . Brown . I would ask her , whether she can swear to the Shirt which was taken off my Back ? Harold . No ; I ca n't swear to that . Hannah Cole . I was in Mrs. Hibbin 's Shop when the Prisoner Brown came in and asked for a Pair of Garters ; ( she keeps a Haberdasher 's Shop . ) I shewed him some Garters , and asked him 6 d. for a Pair ; He bid me 3 Pence for them , which I told him I could not take . Then , says he , give me a Penny-worth of black Worsted . I gave it him , and he threw the Penny behind the Counter , and I took the Candle and stooped down to look for the Money . When I got up , the Bundle was gone . I saw no Person in the Shop , but Brown , and he told me , while I was looking for the Money , that one of the Half-pence was this Way , and the other , was that Way ; so while I was looking for them the Bundle was taken . Brown . Can you swear I took the Linnen out of the Shop ? Cole . I ca n't do that , - but there might be some-body with you who did it . Celia Jones . I have nothing to say against the Prisoners ; but Mr. Justice Lade sent for my Sister and me , to see if we owned a Shirt , and a Table-cloth . They both proved to be my Brother and and Sister Cartwright 's . I delivered them to Mrs. Harold to be washed . Mrs. Burnet . I went upon Notice from Sir John Lade , and swore to a Pair of Sheets ; the Mark in the upper Sheet has been picked out , but I knew it again : 't is made of Yard and half-wide Holland . The other is common coarse Cloth . I swear to them . They were delivered by my Servant to Mrs. Harold . Ralph Mitchell . One Harris , and Proctor being taken up , and sent to the New Goal , Harris informed us of this Robbery , and said he believed if we took the Prisoners soon , we should find two of the Shirts upon their Backs . We took them both , and the Shirt upon Eakins was own 'd , but that upon Brown , was not sworn to . They each of them desired to be admitted an Evidence , and Brown said if the Favour was granted him , he would tell where all the rest of the Linnen was . Accordingly by his Directions , we found the Sheets , and the Table-cloth . Brown . He knew I was a misfortunate Man before , and so he asked me to turn Evidence , but I told him I knew nothing of the Matter . Pray was there any Evidence against us when we were taken ? Mitchell . Yes ; that of Proctor and Harris . The Jury found them guilty of Felony , but acquitted them of taking out of the Shop . [ Transportation .

William Curd . On the 29th of October last , it being Lord-Mayor 's Day , I went out about two o'Clock from my House at Stepney , to see the Show : and I left my Servant John Brown at Home , and bid him make an End of the Work he was about , and then he might go abroad too , but I bid him carry the Key of the Door , before he went out , to his Mistress , who was out in the Neighbourhood . A little before Six , I returned , and called upon my Wife for the Key of the Door ; and having appointed to meet a Friend , at a publick House over-against our House , I took the Key from my Wife , and went to meet my Friend . But when I came against my own Door , I saw it open , and upon that I went cross the Way , and upon going into my House , I found the Kitchen Door open , and I had not gone above two or three Steps into the Kitchen , before the Prisoner ran against me . I laid hold of him by the Collar , and asked him what he did there , but I was so surprized , that I ca n't tell what Answer he made . He struck me , and I struck him , and we were both down on the Ground together in the Kitchen . He pulled from me , to get out of Doors , and he got into the Entry ; I cried out , and threw him down again : after which he got to the Street Door , and the Neighbours heard me make a Noise . I tore his Cloaths sadly , - that I did , and I threw him down in the Street , when the People came to assist me , and secured him . After he was in hold , I went Home to see what was missing , and I soon saw a Shirt of mine was gone , and some Pieces of Camblet belonging to Isaac Hay , and upon searching the Prisoner , we found 25 Keys in his Pocket . Prisoner . Could you not see by the Light of the Day , to distinguish one Man 's Face from another ? Curd . No ; it was totally dark ; I could not distinguish him , nor know him , 'till he was taken into a House : but I am sure he never got out of my Hands , 'till he was taken . - He was sent to the Watch-house that Night , but he escaped from thence , and was not taken 'till Monday in the Christmas Week . Prisoner . He says it was about Six o'Clock in the Evening , when he took hold of me , - but it was between Five and Six * . * This Assertion of the Prisoner , and the foregoing Question , were in Order to get clear of the Burglary . John Brown . My Master left me at Home when he went out ; it was about Four o'Clock before I had done Work , and when I left the House , I locked the Door , and carried the Key to my Mistress . John Lovell . I was going that Day to Mr. Curd 's House , about Four o'Clock in the Afternoon , and I met his Servant John Brown , within three or four Doors of the House , and he told me his Master was gone to see my Lord-Mayor 's Show . About Six , I met Mr. Curd in Bishopsgate-Street , and he told me he would meet me at Mr. Boocay 's at the Two Fighting Cocks at Stepney . I went thither and heard , that Mr. Gates 's Son had broke open a House . I did not know whose House had been broke , but I saw the Prisoner sitting in the House bald pated . I asked Mr. Boocay when he saw Mr. Curd ? Why do n't you go over the Way to him , says he , for 't is his House that has been broke open , and his Wife is abroad ? I ran over to him , and found a Hat upon the Table in the Kitchen : then I went to Mr. Boocay 's again , and asked the Prisoner if he had no Accomplices with him ? If no body stood at the Door , to watch , while he went into the Back-kitchen ? He insisted upon it that no one was with him , and upon our asking him how he opened the Door , he said he opened it with one of the Keys which he had about him . I asked him , if he had any one to receive the Goods ? He told us no , he intended to have carried them to pawn . As we were carrying him to the Watch-house , he desired me to speak to Mr. Curd to be easy with him , and he promised me , he would go aboard of a Ship the next Day . Prisoner . Ask him if he ever heard any Harm of me before ? Lovell . I ca n't say I have . Grace Snagg . While two Men had hold of the Prisoner in the Street , I saw him drop this Shirt , I took it up , and set my Mark upon it . I saw him drop it at Mr. Curd 's Door . Curd . This is my Shirt . John Smith , Headborough . I was sent for , to take Charge of the Prisoner , on the 29th of October . I searched him , and found a Parcel of Keys , ( 25 in all ) upon him . He was carried to the Watch-house that Night , but when I went to look for my Prisoner , in the Morning , he was gone . Abraham Boocay . On the 29th of October , as I was in my House , I heard somebody cry out , I went to see what was the Matter , and Mr.Curd desired me to help him to secure the Prisoner . I , and another assisted Mr. Curd , and we kept him 'till the Constable took Charge of him . Hannah Greathouse . I live in Mr. Curd 's House , and have a Key to the Door . I went out after Mr Curd 's Man , and I am sure I locked the Door after me . When it was Candle-light , I came home to shut up my Windows . I found the Door locked , and I went out again and fastened it . Prisoner . I happened to be coming past Mr. Curd 's Door that Night , and he jumped off the Threshold of the Door , and pulled me into his House , and said , - You Rogue , you have broke open my House . Master , says I , what 's the Matter ! So we struggled together , and tumbled about , 'till People came and carried me to Mr. Boocay 's , where I was search 'd , and nothing was found upon me , but my own Keys , which were to sit to the Street-Door , the Kitchen-Door , and the Garret-Door , in my own House .

I was standing with Mrs. Floyd 's Coach in Great Earl-Street , the 24th of December , and saw the Prisoner behind the Coach , picking out the great Nails . I stood still , and saw him pick out five or six . And in the Space of 10 Minutes , he had got out 17 Nails , and had taken off this Brass Top , from one of the Corners of the Coach . This Nail , and this Top , I found in his Pocket , and I am sure they are Mrs. Floyd 's , and belong to her Coach ; the rest he slung away when I laid hold of him , and at the same Time , he cut me across this Hand with his Knife , in such a Manner , that I thought I should never more have had the Use of it .

Henry Williams . The Prisoner lived with me as a Servant about two Months . These are the Goods he is charged with stealing , and I swear they are mine . He confessed before Colonel De Veil , January 26 , that he had stole two Cloth Coats , and a Serge Coat ; a Drugget Waistcoat , and two Pair of Cloth Breeches ; one Pair of the Breeches were found in Pawn , but he would not confess any Thing of the rest . Prisoner . I confessed no more than two Coats . James Abram . On the 24th of December last , between five and six at Night , my Master Williams went out to drink Tea with Mrs. Sumner , and he bid me take Care of the Shop : So as I was walking in the Shop , I saw a poor-looking Woman in the Back-Shop , and I heard the Prisoner ( who was employed to mend up some of the Goods ) say , - Stand back ! here 's my Master ! Hearing those Words , I stopp 'd to one of our Shop-Doors , next Monmouth-Street , to watch what they were doing , and I observed the Prisoner to slide something off to the Woman , and she took it under her Apron , and went away . Kit Burgoine , our Porter , was then shutting up Shop ; I bid him leave the Shutters , and come along with me . He followed me out into the Street , and four Doors beyond my Master 's House , I saw the Woman ( who came out of our Back-Shop ) slip something from under her Apron , to another Woman . Upon this I bid Kit lay hold of one of them , and I seized the other . He turned his Woman 's Riding-hood on one Side and I took a Scarlet Broad-Cloth Coat from her . Says I , this is the Coat I saw Jewster ( the Prisoner ) slide to the Woman in the Back-Shop , therefore carry the Women to the Alehouse , and keep them there , while I get a Constable , and call my Master . Mr. Williams ( my Master ) thought proper to go Home , and examine the Prisoner . He asked him , in my Presence , what he had done ? He said , he had done nothing at all . I am perswaded you have , pray what Woman was that who was with you ? He insisted upon it he had done nothing , and that he had not seen any Woman that Night . Upon this I went to the Porter , and brought him and the two Women to the Shop ; and the Woman upon whom the Coat was found , proved to be one Catberine Sommers , the Prisoner 's Landlady , and the other was his Wife . Sommers told us , the Prisoner owed her half a Year 's Rent , and that his Wife had given her the Coat in Part of Payment . Upon this he was carried before Colonel De Veil , who committed him . Prisoner . It was Necessity drove me to it . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 130 , 131. Eleanor Bolton , and Elizabeth Smith were indicted for stealing 3 worsted Stockings , val . 3 s. the Goods of Mary Steel , December 12 . Mary Steel . On the 12th of December , the 2 Prisoners came into my Shop , under Pretence of buying some Stockings . - I keep a Shop , in Great-Earl-Street , by the 7 Dials . - I asked them what Price they 'd please to go to ? They said they could not tell . At last they would go to half a Crown if they liked them . I reached down a Bundle , but they did not fancy the Colour ; they must be lighter , and I must shew them some of 2 s. 3 d. While I turned my Head to look for another Bundle , they whipped 2 Stockings out of the Paper , and one off the Line in the Window . The odd Stocking I missed directly , and desired it might be found . O ( they said ) , I should find it by and bye , and bid me look behind the Counter ; but upon my making Words with them , Ellen Bolton threw the odd Stocking over Smith 's Shoulder upon the Counter . I told them I missed another Pair , and I called a Woman ( Mrs. Pritchard ) into the Shop , and ran round the Counter myself . While I was coming round , they ( some how or other ) dropped the Stockings upon the Ground , I desired them to pay for them , ( for they were trod all to Dirt , under Smith 's Feet ) but they abused me very handsomely . I had searched where they both had stood , twice , before the Stockings were found , and they were not then upon the Ground . Bolton . Did you take any Thing from me ? Mrs Steel . She threw the odd Stocking to me , upon the Counter , over Smith 's Shoulder . Bolton . I catched a Stocking as it dropped to the Ground , and gave it her directly . Elizabeth Pritchard . I happened to be washing , that Day , at Mrs Steel 's , and she called me into the Shop , to reach her down a Parcel of Stockings to shew the Prisoners . At the same Time she came round the Counter herself , and picked up the Stockings under Smith 's Feet . When they were carried before the Justice , they were search 'd , and there was but 6 Pence found in both their Pockets . Each of them had some Half-pence , which made up but 6 d. in all . Joseph Sutton . I was called to take charge of the Prisoners , and I carry 'd them before a Justice ; but I was not present when they were examined . Bolton . I went into this Gentlewoman 's Shop , to buy a Pair of Stockings ; I had 16 Pence in my Pocket , and Elizabeth Smith , had 6 Pence in her 's . I wanted a Pair of the same Colour , that Smith had upon her Legs , and we thought the Stockings upon the Line , was pretty like what we wanted ; but as one of them was missing , I said perhaps 't is tumbled off the Counter , and I stooped down and took it up and gave it the Gentlewoman . I looked about for the others which were missing as well as she , but she came round the Counter and found some under Smith 's Feet . Upon this she asked Smith to pay for them ; she refused , and then the Gentlewoman struck her , and Smith struck her again , and so the Constable was called . Smith . The Constable saw we did not offer to take any Thing out of the Shop , nor use the Gentlewoman with any Ill manners . As to their saying , we had no Money , we paid some Money when we were sent to the Gatehouse , and there 's the Beadle , ( Mr. Penny ) who found us drinking there , which we could not have done if we had had no Money . John Penny . I know of no Expence they were at , at the Gatehouse , not I . - They insisted upon it , before Colonel De Veil , that they had Money to pay for the Stockings they wanted , when they were in the Shop . Upon this Mr De Veil ordered me to search them , and I found no more than 6 Penny-worth of Half-pence between them both . They did not then say they had spent any Money ; I fetched them from the Roundhouse , and do n't know of their having been put to any Expence at all . There was nothing spent in my Sight . Both Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 132. Thomas Hurnell was indicted , for that he on the 5th of October , in the 10th Year of His Majesty 's Reign , in the Parish of St. Bride 's , took to Wife Mary Gardiner , Spinster , and to her was then and there married : and afterwards , viz . on the 4th of November in the 13th Year of His Majesty , at the Parish of St. Bartholomew , behind the Exchange , he feloniously took to Wife Elizabeth Keep , Spinster , his former Wife ( Mary Gardiner ) being still living . The Counsel for the Prosecution having open 'd the Indictment , the Nature of the Evidence , to be offered in Support thereof , was mention 'd : and it was urged , that the Defendant ( who is a Clerk to a Blackwell-Hall Factor ) in the Year 1736 , having marry 'd Mary Gardiner , they lived for some Time at the House of one Watts a Peruke-Maker , and afterwards , at one Carrol 's a Barber , at Fleet Ditch , near Holborn Bridge ; and that at these 2 Places they lived together as Man and Wife , and had several Children , and were understood by all their Acquaintance to be Man and Wife . That the first Marriage was at the Fleet , but both Shelburn , ( the Parson ) and the Clerk being dead , they were under some Difficulty in procuring Shelburn 's Register-Books . That the Defendant afterwards , getting acquainted with Mrs. Elizabeth Keep , a young Gentlewoman of between 3 and 4000 l. Fortune , ( who was an Orphan , and under the Care of the City ) he took a Lodging at the House of one Mrs. Immin 's , in Winchester-street , where this young Gentlewoman lived with her Grand-mother , Mrs. Graves . When he had lodged here some Time , he took a Lodging in Throckmorton-Street , that when he had accomplished his Ends , he might have a Place to carry her to . That the Defendant in a little Time , by the Assistance of a Servant in the House , got the Lady away , marry 'd her , and then carry 'd her to Throckmorton Street , and has had the Custody of her ever since , & c. & c. Couns . Pris . The Expression - [ a second Marriage ] is not so very proper , but we admit the Marriage with this young Lady , [ Mrs Keep ] . It was likewise insisted upon , by the Counsel , in Behalf of the Defendant , that if they should produce a Fleet-Register , [ with Relation to the first Woman ] it would not be a legal Register , and so would be no Register at all . That Cohabitation was no Proof of a Marriage , not would a Fleet-Register , ( if it should be brought ) be sufficient to convict a Man of Felony , since even in a Civil Action it would not be allow 'd without other Proof . And that , in case of a Felony , it has always been insisted upon , that positive Proof be given of the first Marriage . It was farther observed , that giving Evidence of a Cohabitation , before they had prov 'd a first Marriage , is like felling a Tree at the Top . And tho ' a Man 's cohabiting with a Woman in an odd way , is a Crime not to be encouraged , yet it wo n't prove him guilty of Felony under this Act of Parliament . It was likewise urged , that the Register of a Parish is by Law an Authentick Register , and might be produced as legal Evidence , but where a Clergyman , un-authorized by Law , shall please to set up , in the Fleet , for himself , and who for Half-a-Crown will put any one 's Name in his Register , it would be hard if such a Person or his Register , should have the Sanction of a Court of justice . Mrs Barret . I knew Anthony Shelburn the Clergyman . He has been dead some Years . Couns . Produce the Register-Book he kept . Barret . I can produce some of the Books , but not all . The Book I am called here to produce , is not in my keeping , - 't is not my Book , but another Person 's ; I never had it in my keeping . I live in Fleet-Lane , but the Book this Marriage is in , belongs to Mr Cox , at the Hand and Pen at the Ditch side . I saw this Book at his House about 2 Months ago , and never have seen it since . Couns . Do you know what 's become of this Book ? Barret . No : I was at Mr Cox 's ( he is Clerk ) at the Hand and Pen about 2 Months ago , and he told me he was going out , and expected some People to come to search that Book , so he left it upon the Table , and ordered me not to let them search , unless they paid me first . Accordingly 2 Gentlemen came to search , and after they had done , I put the Book into the Beauset , and have never seen at since . Couns . Do n't you know where the Book is ? Barret . No , I do n't , upon my Word , - upon my Oath I do not . Couns . Has no Body apply 'd to you about this Book ? Barret . No . Couns . Recollect yourself , - has no Body apply 'd to you , to have this Book from you ? Barret . No , Sir , indeed : nor can I tell where the Book is . Couns . What Books are they which you have got with you ? Barret . They are the Registers of my Husband 's Marriages : I ca n't give any Account of the other Book . Couns . Who were the Gentlemen that came to search the Book which we want ? Barret . I ca n't tell ; but there was two Gentlemen came to me to enquire about the Book , in which was the Marriage with Mary Gardiner . Couns . You mention a particular Book ; what Entry was it they came to see ? Barret . They came to search for an Entry , on such a Day , and they were scrupulous about paying ; at last one of them said he would pay ; after which they search 'd , and said they had found it . Couns . What did he say he had found ? Barret . He said he had found the Name he wanted ; but he did not mention what the Name was . Couns . Did not you tell the Gentlemen who came to search , that the Book was your 's , and that you had bought it ? Barret . No ; I did not . Couns . So , you say , you do n't know what 's become of that Book ? Barret . No : I put it where I found it , and have never seen it since that Time . It was Mr Cox 's Book at that Time ; but he is dead , and it went to his Widow : She has since sold it to other Persons , and I know not who they are . When those Gentlemen came to look at it , it was left upon the Table at the Hand and Pen , and I was desired to stay by the Book , till the Gentlemen came . They came and search 'd it , after which I put it into the Beaufet ; since which it has never been seen at all . Dr. Morley was call 'd , but did not appear . John Carrol . I am a House-keeper in St. Andrew 's Parish : I live by the Fleet-Market now , but for two Years last past , I kept a House in St. Sepulchre 's Parish . Couns . Do you know the Prisoner , Hurnell ? Carrol . Yes . - About two Months before last Christmas was twelve Months , he came and looked at a Room , and said he would send a Gentlewoman , in a Day or two , to see it , and agree for it . The Gentlewoman came , and took the Room , and gave me Earnest for it . Couns . How long did he and she remain at your House ? Carrol . 'Till about a Week before last Christmas . Couns . Did the Gentlewoman and he lie together at your House , during that Time ; and did you imagine they were Man and Wife ? Carrol . I gave Receipts for the Rent in his Name . Couns . Mind what you are ask 'd . I ask you whether you have heard him call her his Wife , or make Use of such Expressions , as made you ima gine she was his Wife . Prisoner . You are upon your Oath . Carrol . He used her in a very handsome Manner . Couns . But when he has been speaking of her to you , or in your Family , in what Manner has it been ? How has he spoke of her ? Carrol . He and I never changed five Words together , all the Time he was in the House . He went up Stairs , and came down , that 's all . Couns . Though you might not have exchanged many Words , yet I ask you , if you have not heard him declare any Thing about this Gentlewoman ? Carrol . I never heard any Body come to ask for him ; but People have ask 'd for her . Couns . We are a little unfortunate , that we have not the most ready , willing Witnesses in the World . - Prisoner . They are your own Witnesses . Couns . But I wish some others have not had Dealings with them . I ask you whether they lay at your House ? Carrol . It was backward and forward , - I ca n't be positive about it . Couns . Consider you are upon your Oath , and you must give fair Answers . Carrol . Why they pass 'd for Man and Wife , and went in one another 's Name . I know no otherwise . Couns . I ask you whether or no , during the Time they were at your House , you never heard him own her to be his Wife ? Carrol . He has ask 'd for her by the Name of Mrs Arnol . Couns . Speak distinctly . Carrol . He said Arnol , to the best of my Knowledge . I can say no more . Couns . But you can speak distinctly if you will . Carrol . He ask 'd for her by the Way of Arnol . Couns . Why what 's the Prisoner 's Name . Carrol . Arnol . Couns . Well , I see here 's a bad Pronunciation , as well as a bad Witness . - Has he ask 'd for her by the same Name he himself went by ? Carrol . I say he has not ask 'd for her above once , to the best of my Knowledge . Couns . But I ask you , whether he has not ask 'd for her by the same Name he went by ? Prisoner . Consider you 're upon your Oath . Carrol . Why I have receiv 'd Letters for Mr Arnol , I never had any Body to ask after him . Couns . You have heard him ask for her by the Name of Arnol , and you pronounce his Name in the same Manner . Was that the Name he went by ? Carrol . She went by the same Name which he went by . Couns . And you say they lived at your House , 'till within two Months before last Christmas was Twelve-Months ; now I ask you , whether she had not one or more Children at your House ? Carrol . She had one : but I do n't know whether it was a Boy or a Girl . Couns . I hope this Child was Christen 'd . Carrol . But I did not see it christen 'd , so I am not a Judge . Couns . I ask you upon your Oath , if you did not know the Child was christen 'd ? Carrol . I did not see it christened ; I do n't know any Thing of it . Couns . Did it die at your House ? Carrol . Yes ; to my Knowledge . Couns . Perhaps you might be at the I uner ' tho ' not at the Christening . Carrol . No , I was at neither . Couns . Did you see the Coffin ? Carrol . I saw the Child . Couns . But I ask you if you saw the Coffin ? Carrol . I ca n't say I did . Couns . Can you say , you did not ? Carrol . I do n't know , to the best of my Knowledge that I did . Couns . How long did it live ? Carrol . Upon my Word I ca n't tell . I was not in the Room above half a dozen Times during their living at my House . Couns . Why Man , ca n't you tell whether it lived two or three Months , or but two or three Days ? Carrol . I ca n't tell indeed . Couns . Did any Persons attend it , in its Illness , as an Apothecary , or a Physician ? Carrol . Yes ; there was an Apothecary , and a Physician came in his Chariot : but I do n't know his Name . Couns . Do you know it if you hear it ? Was the Apothecary 's Name Avery ? Carrol . I ca n't tell indeed ; I did not hear it mentioned , nor the Doctor 's Name neither . The Doctor came to Mrs Arnol , I see him come four or five Times . Couns . Do you know the Midwife 's Name ? Carrol . No , nor the Nurse 's neither . I never asked them their Names , and how should I know their Names , when I never asked them . Couns . When they went from your House , do you know whether they went ? Carrol . I ca n't tell . I know nothing at all of it , 'till the Day she paid me , and then she said , she was going to the other End of the Town , to live nearer at Hand with her Spouse : but he was not present at that Time . Couns . Had you no Conversation with him about leaving your House ? Carrol . Not till afterwards . Mr Arnol came to our House afterwards , and we had two or three Words together ; I told him Mrs Arnol had not given me proper Warning , and that I expected a Quarter 's Rent , if I should not let the Room - I am very ingenuous , - he said , he had given her Money to pay for the Quarter that was passed . - Couns . Who did he say he had given the Money to ? Carrol . ToMrs Arnol . He did not mention a Word more , but only that he had given her Money for the Quarter which was due , and which was to come . - Her Name was not then mentioned . Couns . Why who did you talk of ? Carrol . I mentioned the Name [ Mrs. Arnol ] to him , and said I had given Mrs Arnol a Receipt for 1 l. 2 s. and 6 d. due at Christmas I gave the Receipts in the Name of Thomas Arnol . Couns . Did any Friends or Acquaintance come to her at your House ? Carrol . When People came , they enquired for Mrs. Arnol . Couns . I ask you , whether during the whole Time they were at your House , she did not go by the Name of Hurnell ? Carrol . She always went by that Name , and Letters were directed to her in that Name . I took them to be Man and Wife all the Time they were at our House . They had a two Pair of Stairs Floor : there was a Closet for a Bed , and a little Parlour : there was every Thing very handsome . There was but one Bed , and she used to lie there constantly . Couns . And did not the Prisoner lie there ? Carrol . He came backward and forward ; I ca n't say he lay there constantly ; but I have seen him go out in the Morning , and come home o'Nights . Mr. Avery . I am an Apothecary , and knew the Woman that lived at this Carrol 's House , when she went by the Name of Gardiner . I have known her seven Years . While she lived at Carrol 's I visited her . She was ill , and had an Inflammation of the Bowels , and lay-in , in the Interim . Couns . Have you frequently visited her there ? Mr. Avery . Never as an Apothecary before that Time . I have visited her since , and my Wife has likewise . I was Godfather to the last Child she had at Carrol 's House , - it was a Girl . Couns . I ask you what Name the Prisoner at the Bar called her by ? And what Declarations you have heard him make ? Mr. Avery . I can say nothing to that . Mrs Hurnell requested of me to stand Godfather . Couns . Was not the Prisoner present ? Mr. Avery . No ; but he was there a little before . Couns . Was he present at the Christening ? Mr. Avery . No ; he was not ; but it was with his Privity that I stood Godfather , because the Question was put to me , and she told him , I was to stand Godfather to the Child . I knew her when she went by the Name of Gardiner , and ever since I have known her , she has born the Character of a very vertuous , good Woman . Couns . Were there any Prescriptions wrote for her in her Illness . Mr. Avery . Yes , and Dr. Morley was the Physician : his Prescriptions were for her , in the Name of Mrs. Hurnell , with this only Difference , her Name with an E , instead of an U. Couns . Was you paid for these Prescriptions ? Avery . Yes ; Mrs. Hurnell paid me , and I gave a Receipt in his Name , to her . Couns . Did you and your Wife visit her ? Avery . Yes , and she visited us ; and since this Affair he has been at out House . Couns . On what Errand did he come ? Avery . It was last Saturday was a Fortnight ; he came and put the Question to me as thus . To ask me if I knew any Thing of Mrs. Gardiner ? I told him , I did not . He said he had been at Mr. Elliot 's , who is a Relation of Mrs Hurnell 's , and had enquired after her , but could not hear any Thing of her ; so he asked me , if I could tell any Thing of her ? I said I could not . Couns . Did not the Prisoner , when you visited her , ask you how she did ? By what Name did he mention her ? Avery . He has asked me in what Manner I found her , - or how she was ill , but never by any Name : tho ' I always took it , that he meaned his Wife . I have called her by the Name of Mrs. Hurnell , to him , and he has never contradicted it . Mrs. Avery . I know the Prisoner , Thomas Hurnell , and have visited Mrs. Hurnell , his Wife ( as I took her to be ) when she lodged at Carrol 's House . Couns . Give your Reasons why you took them to be Man and Wife ? Mrs. Avery . Because they always seemed to live together as Man and Wife , and she said , he was her Husband . Couns . Have you ever heard him say any Thing like that ? Mrs. Avery . I never heard him say any Thing at all . I never saw him in his Room , but twice in my Life . Couns . Was you at the Christening of any of their Children ? Mrs. Avery . No : nor at any of her Children 's Funerals . Couns . Did they ever visit you ? Mrs. Avery . Mrs. Hurnell often did . Couns . How was their Way of Living understood in the Neighbourhood ? Mrs. Avery . I never heard that any one took them for any other , but Man and Wife : and I knew a pretty many of their Acquaintance too . Couns . Has not the Prisoner applied to you lately ? On what Occasion ? Mrs. Avery . About a Fortnight or three Weeks ago , he came to our House , and asked if Mrs. Gardiner was there ? I told him , I did not know who he meant : is she not your Wife ? He said , No , and asked me if she had paid my Husband . I told him , I believed she had . Because , said he , if she has , I desire your Husband not to trust her any more , in my Name , but on her own Account , for she is not my Wife . I was but very little acquainted with him before this , but I was acquainted with Mrs. Hurnell some Years before , and since she was married . She went by the Name of Gardiner before , and was a very modest Woman , as any one would say that was to see her . She was a sober , modest , fedate Woman , and I never heard otherwise : Couns . Do you know of any Children being born ? Mrs. Avery . Yes , two : and I took them to be Mr. Hurnell 's , they are both dead . One of them I saw , and as sine a Boy it was , as ever I saw in my Life . Couns . Did you see the Coffin ? Mrs. Avery . No , neither of them . It was the first Child which I saw ; it was brought to my House by 2 Nurses and the Mother to shew me . Couns . Did you know any Thing of her after she left Carrol 's House ? Mrs. Avery . Yes , for in her deplorable Trouble , she came to give me an Account of it . Sarah Newbury . I prosess Midwifry ; and Mrs. Hurnell being taken ill , at Carrol 's House , I was sent for , and she had the Advice of a Physician , ( Dr. Morley ) she was with Child , and had a Fever . Couns . You call her Mrs. Hurnell , how came you to call her by that Name ? Newbury . She came to me by that Name , when she was with Child , and directed me to enquire for her by that Name . Couns . Have you ever seen the Prisoner at these Lodgings ? Newbury . Yes , several Times during her Indisposition , and he always treated her , in a very handsome , tender Manner , - as Gentlemen treat their Wives . Couns . Did he call her by any particular Name ? Newbury . No , he did not call her by any Name , but he used her in a tender Manner , and desired me to take Care of her . Couns . By what Name was the Child christened ? Newbury . I was not at the Christening , nor at the Funeral . Jane Ayres . I know the Person whom they formerly called Mary Gardiner , but I did not know her by that Name . I kept her when she lay-in by the Prisoner , at Carrol 's House . I know the Prisoner ( Hurnell ) very well : he used to come sometimes three Times a Day to visit her . Couns . Did he call her by any particular Name ? Ayres . I ca n't say that : but he would come and say , - how does she do now ? He never called her by any Name , nor do I remember he ever called her his Wife ; but he gave me a great Charge to take care of her , and one Night , he gave me a particular Charge about her . I know she went by his Name . Couns . Do you remember the Funeral of the Child ? Ayres . Yes ; I ordered the Coffin myself . It was a Girl , and I went to the Undertaker 's and ordered the Name Anne Hurnell to be put upon it . This was the second Child : the first I know nothing of . Rachel Carrol . I am the Wife of John Carrol ; I know the Prisoner : he came himself to see a Room at our House : I had not Opportunity to shew him the Room he afterwards had , but my Husband shewed him a lower Room of the same fort . About three Days afterwards , Mrs Hurnell and a Relation of her 's came and took it , I think it was the 3d of November . last was 12 Months . It was one Apartment , only there was a Place for a Bed in it . Couns . Who lay in it ? Carrol . It was for two Persons , to be sure . Couns . Did you ever see the Prisoner a-bed ? Carrol . No : but he used to come in almost every Night , between 7 and 8 . Couns . Have you seen him go away again o ' Nights . Carrol . I ca n't say I ever saw him go away again o'Nights ; but I think I saw him once go away in the Morning . Couns . By what Name did he call her ? Or how did he address himself to her ? Carrol . I ca n't say he ever asked for her as he went up , or down , our Apartment lies so , that we seldom saw one another . Couns . Did he come Home , and ask for her when she was abroad ? Carrol No . The Morning she was brought to Bed , I met him coming up Stairs , and he said , - pray how does my Wife do ! I told him , she was more likely to die than to live . This was when she lay in of the last Child , which was a Girl . I never heard him call her Wife , but that Time . Visitors indeed have asked for her by the Name of Hurnell . and Letters out of the Country have been cirected to her , in that Name . Silisia Pitts . I know the Prisoner ; Mrs. Hurnell his Wife , is a Neice of mine : her Maiden Name was Mary Gardiner . Before the Prisoner and she were marry 'd she lodged with me , and Mr. Hurnell visited her , every Night , with a great deal of Respect . Soon after they were marry 'd , I was taken ill , so I sent for her to come and be with me . - Couns . Do you know that they were marry 'd ? Pitts . She declar 'd they were marry 'd , and I saw him soon after I understood they were marry 'd , and I wish 'd him Joy of his Wife ; he accepted it , and bowed and thanked me . This was about last Michaelmas was 3 Years . I was telling you , she was with me , while I was ill , and the Nights she did not stay with me , he always came and fetch 'd her Home . Couns . Well , pray what did he use to call her ? Pitts . I ca n't say I ever heard him call her any Thing , but Polly and my Dear . Couns . Did you use to visit them ? Pitts . Yes ; I visited them as Man and Wife ; they cohabited together , and I believed them to be Man and Wife . I judged so from his Behaviour , for he seemed to be very tender of her . Couns . You are related to her , pray has she any Sisters ? Pitts . Yes , 2 or 3 , but I never saw any of them in the Prisoner 's Company : She has a Mother likewise , but she lives at Birmingham . Mrs. Powel . I know the Prisoner , and likewise Mrs. Hurnell . I have known Him , ever since he was marry 'd to Mrs. Hurnell , or Mrs. Gardiner . I always thought they were marry 'd , and they always appeared as Man and Wife . Couns . Have you ever heard him call her his Wife ? Powel . I never heard him call her Wife ; he used to call her Polly , and My Dear . They always behaved well , and he always used her like a Gentleman . I visited them very often after the Marriage , and always took her to be his Wife . The Counsel for the Prosecution were about to prove , that this Mrs. Hurnell [ or Gardiner ] was now living , but the Counsel for the Prisoner admitted it . Prisoner . I am innocent of the Fact they charge me with . William Watts . I live in Greville-Street , Hatton-Garden , and am a Peruke-Maker , I know both the Prisoner , and Mary Gardiner ; she lodg 'd near two Years in my House , and during that Time , I did not take her to be any Man 's Wife . She came to live at my House about October or November , in the Year 1736 , and continued there about two Years ; in all which Time I had no Reason to believe she was marry 'd to the Prisoner , nor did he ever call her any Thing but Gardiner , nor did I ever hear any one in the House call her any Thing else . The Prisoner used to come after her , and ask for her by the Name of Gardiner , and by that Name he had Admittance to her . She never pretended to me , nor to any one in my Hearing , that she was marry 'd . Couns . Did you never see any Letters , which were directed to her at your House , by the Name of Hurnell ? Watts . I never saw any . Couns . And was she never call 'd by the Name of Hurnell at your House ? Watts . There was some few People came after her , and ask 'd for one Mrs. Hurnell , who lodged up two Pair of Stairs , and I told them I knew no such Person , - but there was one Mrs. Gardiner , I told them . I afterward told the Prisoner of this , and he seemed surpriz 'd , and charged me , if any People came to ask for her by that Name , to tell them there was no such Person liv 'd there . He was surpriz 'd when I told him People ask 'd for her by the Name of Hurnell . Couns . Did none of their Relations come to visit them , as Man and Wife ? Watts . Never as Man and Wife : they never kept a Table together as Man and Wife , nor did they ever talk of going to visit Relations . Couns . Did not the Prisoner lodge there too ? Watts . No . Couns . Did he never lodge there ? Watts . I do n't know that he did . - I believe he may have lodg 'd there all Night , but upon my Oath I never saw them together . Couns . Why did she not lie-in at your House ? Watts . I believe she did ; but I do n't know who visited her : Mr. Hurnell visited her then , as he did at other Times , and ask 'd for her by the Name of Gardiner . Couns . So tho ' you did not take her for a marry 'd Woman , yet you permitted her to stay at your House , and Hurnell to visit her . Watts . Why , indeed , I did not take her to be a marry 'd Woman , for Mr Hurnell told me he had Lodgings at an Apothecary 's behind the Change . He was my Customer , and I have sent my Man there for his Wig . 'T was at one Mr Maddox 's in Throgmorton-Street . I am far from thinking she was his Wife ; if she had been so , I believe I should have known it . John Wynne . I was Mr Watt 's Journeyman ; and remember Mary Gardiner 's lodging at our House . I liv 'd with Watts above twenty Months ; I came to him in April , - I ca n't tell the Year ; and it is about a Twelve-month ago since I left his Service , in December . She had liv 'd there before I came , and was in the House while I continued with Watts ; but she went away about a Fortnight or three Weeks before me . During this Time , she went by the Name of Gardiner , and no other , as I know of . Mr Hurnell is a Customer of my Master 's ; I never took her to be his Wife ; it was never suspected she was so , but always to the contrary . If she had been his Wife , I should have known it . - She was always enquired for by the Name of Gardiner . Mary Wynne . I do n't remember the particular Time when Mrs. Gardiner lodged at Watt 's ; but his Servant , and one Mrs Scriven 's ( who likewise lodged in the House ) being both my Acquaintance , I visited them while Mrs. Gardiner liv 'd there , and I have heard them call her Mrs. Gardiner . If she had gone by any other Name , I should have known it . Margaret Ellis . I knew Mrs. Gardiner while she lodged at Watts 's : She was there about 2 Years , and went by the Name of Gardiner ; if she had gone by any other Name , I should have known it , for I lodged 3 Years in the House . I knew her when she lived at Carrol 's , and she there went by the Name of Gardiner : I have asked for her at that House , by that Name , and a Boy has told me , she was above Stairs . I never knew she was marry 'd in my Life . Mrs. Cooper . I had a Child to nurse , from Mrs Gardiner , in the Name of Mary Gardiner . I had it 8 Months , and it has been dead a Year , and as much as since last Hay-time . It was christened by the Name of William Gardiner . Mr Cooper . I knew Mrs. Gardiner when we took the Child to nurse . My Wife received it by the Name of William Gardiner . I was at the Christening , and stood Godfather ; it was baptized by the Name of William Gardiner . Mr. Ingram . This is the Register-Book of Aldersgate Parish . I believe there is an Entry made of the Christening of a Child of Mary Gardiner , on the 4th of January 1737 . The Child was baptized at our Church , on Sunday after Afternoon Sermon . I could not tell whether the Name was Garner , or Gardiner , so I entered it into the Book by the Name of William Garner . The Entry was read. `` Register of all the Marriages , Christen. `` ings and Burials , in St Butolph Aldersgate. `` Christenings , January 1737 . Jan. 4 . William , `` Son of William and Mary Garner . Mr Cooper . The Child was brought from our House at Walthamslow , to their Lodging in Greville-street , and was christened in Aldersgate Church , by the Name of William . It 's Sirname was Gardiner . The Mother was there at the same Time , and I do n't remember any Dispute about the Name . The Prisoner 's Counsel offer 'd to call Mary Gardiner in his Behalf , but it was not permitted them . Acquitted . 133 , 134. William Snowd and Joseph Wells were indicted for assaulting Robert Hull , on the King 's Highway , in the Parish of Heston , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him 7s . in Money , December 19 . The Witnesses at the Prisoners Request were examined apart . Mr . Hull . On the 19th of December , I was coming over Hounslow-Heath , in the Hillendon Stage-Coach , between 2 and 3 in the Afternoon , and 2 Men came up to the Coach and robbed us . They asked us for our Money , and took 7 Shillings from me . The Henley Stage-Coach was robbed just before us , but what they took from thence I ca n't tell . I ca n't swear to the Prisoners , because they had Paper-Masks on their Faces ; but 2 Gentlemen 's Servants being hunting on the Heath , I sent them after the Men who had robbed us , and the 2 Prisoners were taken , and they say , they are the same Men . Snowd . What Sort of Cloaths had the Men on who robbed you ? Hull . One had a white Coat on , and the other a brown one . Snowd ( I take it ) was in the white Coat , and Wells in the brown . I kept them in Sight about 10 Minutes , and sent these Men after them ; but I did not keep them in View till they were taken ; most part of the Time I did , and saw that one of them was on a brown Horse , and the other on a grey Gelding . There were other Coaches behind us , 4 ( I believe ) in all , and I saw them go to them . The Reading and Henley Coaches were robbed at the same Time . - This is the first Time I have seen the Prisoners since the Robbery was committed , for after we were robbed , we went on , in the Coach ; therefore I ca n't swear to them ; and that 's all I have to say . Snowd . Then I presume he knows neither of us , but by Hearsay . He knows not which is Snowd , nor which is Wells . In the next Place he says , he saw us rob the first Coach . I would ask him if there were any others in the Coach with him , when he was robbed ? Hull . Yes , 2 Gentlemen , and 2 Gentlewomen . They did not rob the 2 Women , but they robbed the other 2 Men . Prisoners . Were the Men who robbed you , in Sight , when the Gentleman 's Servants came up to you ? Hull . Yes ; they were then both in Sight , and I told them I had been robbed by those two Men . Snowd . Did you see the Huntsman when you was in the Coach ? Hull . Yes . Prisoners . What Part of the Coach did you fit in ? Hull . I sat on the Left-Hand Side ; with my Back to the Horses : I was coming to Town , and there was one Coach before us , and another behind . I did not see them rob the first Coach , but I put myself out of the Coach , and saw them rob the other Coaches . Snowd . And were the 2 Persons , who robbed the other Coaches , pursued immediately ? Hull . Yes , they were pursued directly . I only speak to the Gentleman 's Servant who rode away for Arms , and then he pursued them directly : He was not gone above 10 Minutes for Arms . Wells . But in those 10 Minutes , did not you lose Sight of the Men ? Hull . Yes , a little ; but not much . Prisoners . Did you describe the 2 Men to the Gentleman 's Servants ? Hull . They were in Sight of them , and saw 'em themselves . John Harding . On Wednesday , December 19 . I was going to my Master Bulstrode 's , ( I am his Servant ) over Hounslow-Heath , - He lives at Hounslow , - and as I was going to his House , I saw 2 Men ride by me into Colibrook Road , and to a Place called Butcher 's Grove . The one was on a grey horse , the other on a brown . Snowd . What Distance were the 2 Men from you , when you saw this ? Harding . About 200 Yards from me , when I saw them first : after which they went into the Road , and stopped a Coach ; I ca n't tell whether it was the Bath , Bristol , or the Reading Coach ; but I knew the Man who drove it , his Name is William Moore . The second Coach they stopped , was the Heuley Coach . They stopped one Coach first , then they went to the second , which was the Henley Stage Coach , and stopped that . After this , they rode away from the Coaches , some Distance out of the Road , and went forwards . I went on likewise ; but the Passengers in the Coaches halloo 'd to me , and beckon 'd to me , to come to them . When I came up , Robert Hull looked out of the Henley Coach , and said he had been robb 'd of his Money , by two Men , and desired me to pursue them , and take them . I said , It signifies nothing to pursue Men , and have no Arms ; but they told me , if I would ride away , and get Arms , they would stand still , and tell me when I came back which Way the Men went . While I was talking to them , I saw the 2 Men ride up to a third Coach , and stop it . Upon this I rode to my Master 's House , ( which was then within Sight ) and a Servant being in the Yard , I desired him to bring me a Gun , which hung up loaded over the Kitchen-Chimney . The Man brought me the Gun , and took my Master 's Mare , and a Blunderbufs , and came along with me . He was the first Man who came up with the Coaches , for I did not stop ; I had so much Sight of the 2 Men when they did the Fact , that I thought I should know them and their Horses , when I saw them again . But the People in the Coach told my Fellow-Servant , they were gone round a Hedge call 'd the Bavers , and that they were about a Quarter of a Mile before . There were at this Time four Stage-Coaches , and one of Mr Paris 's together , but I went on , without asking any Questions , because I had seen the Men , and I knew the Horses so well , that I could be positive to them , ( if I should see them again ) without any Direction . So I rode round the Bavers , and a Shepherd told me , the Men were just gone before me . He thought ( I suppose ) they had done some Mischief by seeing us ride hard with Guns . When I was got out upon the Heath , beyond the Bavers , I found I was beyond the Prisoners , therefore I turn 'd back again , and met some Servants of my Lord Berkeley 's , who told me the Men were gone down a Nine-pin Alley , and over the Stile . When I came to the Stile , I could perceive the Track of their Horses over the Stile , into Harlendon Field ; so I rode along the Outside of the Field , which joins to my Lord Berkeley 's Park , and came to the Park , where there is a Pannel in the Pales , which may be listed up ; but that being lock 'd , and the Gate likewise , the Prisoners were obliged to take the Foot-path to Harlendon , and go over a Stile , by Mr Bright 's Dog-kennel . When we came to Harlendon , we enquired if any Body had seen 2 Men ride that Way , one on a grey , the other on a brown Horse ? and at Dawley Lodge a Man told us , they were just before us , and were at Dawley Park , belonging to the Lord Bolingbroke : So we pursued them down the Lane , and were told by a Man , who was driving a Farmer 's Cart , that they were just before us . We went on till we came to Hillendon ; and at a Smith 's Shop , we saw the 2 Prisoners stand at the Heads of their Horses , to have a Shoe put on , and Cloths were thrown over the Horses Backs . I got up first , and knowing the Men and Horses , I turned from the Shop into a hollow Way , 'till my Companion came up . Then we got off our Horses , and while we were dismounting , the Prisoners whipp 'd out at the Smith 's Back-door : I cry 'd out , - `` Gentlemen , if you offer to go `` away , I 'll shoot you : - You have robb 'd `` such and such Coaches . '' Upon this they turn 'd back , and came through the Smith 's Shop again , and would have got into the Smith 's House , but we went up to them with our Gun and Blunderbuss , and told them , If they did not surrender , or if they offer 'd to shoot , we would let fly at them . Wells immediately surrender 'd to my Fellow-Servant ; but Snowd ran away , and got through a little Wicket , into a Garden : But as he was getting over the Garden-Pales , into a Field , I up with my long Gun , and said I would shoot him as he ran . He turn 'd and begg 'd I would not shoot him , and so he surrender 'd . After which we had them both into the House , and carry 'd them into the Kitchen , where great Numbers of People ( near Fourscore ) came into see them ; so we had them into a private Room while their Horses were shod ; and my Horse had likewife thrown off 2 Shoes in the Pursuit . While we were in this Room , I gave them the Liberty to go before what Magistrate they pleased : They chose to go before my Master ( 'Squire Bulstrode ) at Hounslow , and Snowd said , he with 'd he had thrown away his Pistol ; for I had taken it from him . This is the Pistol , and this is the Ball that was in it ; it was charged with Powder and Ball . My Fellow-Servant took a Pistol from Wells , and discharg 'd it against a Brick-Wall , and the Impression the Ball made remains there now , if nobody has destroy 'd it . As they chose to go before my Master , we put them on their own Horses , and carry 'd them thither , and in my Master 's Yard we charged a Constable with them , and they were examin 'd by my Master ; but as to any Confession they made , I know nothing of it . While we had them in the private Room , one of them said , in the Hearing of the other , - `` He wish 'd we had shot them , for he was sure `` they should be hang 'd . '' But I do n't remember which of them it was said this , nor what Reply the other made to it . They both cry 'd very much . Prisoners . From the Observation you made , can you take on you to swear we are the Men who robbed the Henley Coach ? Harding . 'T is hard swearing to their Faces , but I can swear to the Horses , and the Cloaths the Men had on . The Persons we took had the same Cloaths on , which the Men had who robbed the Coach : and I am positive to the Horses . Prisoners . At 200 Yards distance , can you take on you to swear to Horses , and Cloaths ? Harding . Yes : for they did not ride fast , they walked their Horses , when they first went before me . And at the same Time when the third Coach was robbed , I was a great deal nearer them . Wills . Did not I live in the Neighbourhood , and did not you know it was me , when I rode by you ? Harding . I believe he did live in the Neighbourhood ; but I ca n't say , I knew it to be him , at that Time . These are the Cloaths they had on when they were taken . This is the Coat that Wells wore , and by the same Token here 's the same Handkerchief in the Pocket , which I lent him at the Smith 's House , to wipe his Eyes . This is the Coat which was upon Snowd . Hull . These are the same Cloaths the Men had on , who robbed me . Harding . I ca n't say the Men were in sight when I came up the second Time to the Coaches . I ca n't tell whether they were or not . The People said , - there go the Men , and they turned round an Elbow of a Hedge . I never stopped to ask the People in the Coach any Questions . Richard Ball . On the 19th of December , John Harding came home to Mr Bulstrode 's , and told me two Men were robbing the Coaches upon the Heath . He said , he had seen them rob two , and they were stopping another when he came away ; so he desired me to get him a Gun , for they were but badly mounted , and he believed he could take them . A Servant in the Yard ran in , and brought him a Gun , and me a Blunderbuss , and we went on directly about one fourth of a Mile on the Heath to the Coaches which had been robbed , and which stood still waiting for us . The People ( in the Coaches ) called out to us , and said , - There are the Men , and they are going round the Bavers . The Coachman upon the Box could see them , but I could not , because of the Bushes upon the Heath . We followed them round the Bavers , and before we had gone a quarter of a Mile round the Hedge , a Man who was picking Turneps told us , the Men were just gone before us . So we went on into Colebrook-Road , and some Drovers informed us , they had just then met them . Presently after this we met a Grasier , who was going after his Cattle , and he told us he met the Men , in the Water at Cranford-Bridge , and that we might overtake them before they got on the next Heath . But when we got upon the Heath we saw a Stage Coach , and the Coachman telling us he had not seen any such Persons in that Road , Harding was about to take one Way , and I another , to see if they had not taken to the Grounds , but meeting with my Lord Berkeley 's Servants , they directed us after them , over a Nine Pin Ground , to a Foot-path , which goes to my Lord Berkeley 's House . When we came to the common Field , we tracked them along the Path , but could not see them . A Woman being in the Field , we enquired of her , if she had not seen two such Men ? She told us yes , and that they had been trying to get into my Lord 's Park , but could not , so they were gone over the Field toward Harlendon . I followed them according to the Woman 's Directions down the Field , and found the Gate fastened , and that they had jumped their Horses over a Stile . I jumped my Mare over , and as soon as I came to Harlendon , a Man told me , they were just gone before me . I rode on to Cranford Lane , and thence to Lord Bolingbroke 's Lane ; and at the Sign of the Woolpack in the Lane , Harding enquired after them again . The Man of the House said , he had not seen any such Persons , but another Man , who was looking out of a Window in the House , told us , he saw them go by about a quarter of an Hour before . Upon this we rode up the Lane as fast as we could , and in the middle of the Lane , a Man who was driving a Cart , told us , he had met them at the Top of the Lane : and before we got out of the Lane , another Man informed us he met them going upon Hillendon Heath . When we got out of the Lane upon the Common , Harding took the Uxbridge Road and I the London Road , but meeting a Coach with Attendants who told me there were no such Persons in that Road , I turned and rode for Hillendon ; and by the Gravel-pits I was told the Men were just before me ; so I went on , and at Hillendon , at a Smith 's Shop , I saw the two Prisoners standing at their Horses Heads : Upon which I rode up to an open Place , and jumped off my Mare , and the two Prisoners ran away to a Gate that goes to an Orchard , but I cocked my Gun , and said , if they would not surrender , I would shoot them . Wells turned round and begged I would not shoot him , and he surrendered ; but Snowd ran thro ' the Gateway . After Wells had told me , he would surrender , while he was coming toward me , he put his Hand into his Pocket ; I thought he might be feeling for a Pistol , so I told him , if he pulled out any Arms , I would shoot him ; and he drawing nearer , with his Hand still in his Pocket , I clapped hold of his Wrist , and having pulled his Hand out , I felt in the Pocket myself , and there I found this Pistol ; upon which I turned my Hand behind me , and discharged it against the Wall . This Paper of Gunpowder , I found in his other Pocket . I ca n't tell what the Pistol was charged with , but the People of the House said , I had beat a Piece of Brick out of the Wall . When Harding had took Snowd , we carried them both into the Kitchen , but such Numbers of People came in , that they desired they might be taken into a private Room , for they said , they were known there , and were not willing all the Country should see them . I think it was Snowd said this ; he told us likewise that he went to School at Uxbridge . In the private Room , they both cried very much , and Snowd asked Wells for his Handkerchief , to wipe his Eyes , but Wells was using it himself , so Harding lent him one , and 't was in the Coat Pocket now . Snowd wept , and and said , in the hearing of Wells , that he knew he must die . Wells answered , he did not value dying , for he had rather die , than live and starve , but for the Disgrace . We told them , we hoped they would not die ; for as they were young Men , and this their first Fact , they might get off , and must not do so any more . They both said , they wished they had thrown their Pistols away . I have seen the Cloaths which have been produced in Court , and I am sure Snowd wore the white Coat , and Wells the brown . Snowd . I ask him whether he 's sure it was I , who said , I am sure we shall die ? Ball . Yes : he said so when he asked Wells to lend him his Handkerchief . I had some little Knowledge of Wells before , but not any Acquaintance with him ; I never knew any Thing ill of him , before . William Martin . I pursued them , for the Good of my King and Country , as well as Harding and Ball , and went after the Prisoners , when the 2 Witnesses went first on the Pursuit ; but I was upon a Coach-Horse , so I could not follow them over Ditch , and over Hedge , as they did ; therefore I quitted my Horse at Cranford-Bridge , and followed them to the Place where they were taken . I did not see them before they were taken , but I followed them by the People 's Directions , and heard Snowd say , 't is a very unfortunate Thing , that we are taken , and I with we had thrown away our Pistols . Yes , said Wells , so it is ; and I wish we had . This was at the Blacksmith 's Arms , a Smith 's Shop at Hillendon . Snowd . I absolutely deny I was on the Heath that Day : and that 's the first thing I have to say . In the next Place , I humbly presume none of them have sworn that we are the very Men who robbed the Coaches , and that they have spoken but circumstantially . There were no Masks found on us , and I absolutely deny the Fact . As to Harding 's swearing I went over a Stile , - I had been very ill ; and had not had a Stool for 5 Days before , and having taken something to open my Body , I went out of the Way to ease myself in a Hog-sty . Then as to the circumstance of the Pistols , I never rode without them . I had a 20 l. Bank Bill , and 3 l. in Money about me , and was then going to sup at Mr Sergeant 's , at Uxbridge : and the Pistol Wells had , was a Pistol which has belonged to his Family several Years : and very good People travel the country with Pistols . And I might say I wished I had thrown my Pistol away , because of the Scandal ; for to be sure it would put an innocent Man into an Agony , to have such a charge upon him . But then there is a great Variation in the Evidence : for Hull swears that 2 Men came up to the Coach , and that he sent 2 Men to pursue them directly . Ball was at Home ; and Hull swears they were both there . Harding went Home to Mr. Bulstrode 's for Arms , and brought Ball with him ; how then could they pursue us directly . Harding . I was in Sight of my Master 's House when the People in the coach told me they were robbed , and they stood still till Ball and I came back from thence . Snowd . As to the white Coat , there are very few People who do not wear white Dussel Coats . Peter Hardcastle . The Day before the Prisoners were apprehended , Wells hired a Horse of me to go to Rumford . He hired it on the Tuesday , and on the Wednesday Morning he had it , which was the Day he was taken . I had seen him once before that Time . Benjamin Dove . Wells hired 2 Horses to go to Rumford , but I ca n't tell the particular Day . One was a brown bay Horse , with a bald Face , which he hired of Mr Hardcastle . I heard of the Robbery , but I ca n't swear it was on that Day . He had a brown coat on at that Time , but I ca n't swear this is the same . Hardcastle . Wells was in a brown Coat when he hired my Horse , but I ca n't swear this is the same . Snowd . Wells hired the Horses to go to Rumford , and desired me to take a ride with him ; but I desired him to ride another Way . Edward Cole , William Wingfield , William Deane , William Passingham , Benjamin Bennet , John Darvson , David Bennet , Lancelot Hall , Henry Pemberton , Robert Jones , John Carr , and Richard Turner , spoke to Well 's Character . Many of them had known him from a Child , and said he had been well educated ; that he was a well behaved Man , and had served part of his Time with Mr Roberts , an Apothecary , and they did not believe he would be guilty of such a Crime . Cornelius Edwards , Thomas Thompkins , John Lloyd , James Base , Thomas Dent , Elizabeth Rayner , Peter Stanton , and Whiston Bristow , had known Snowd a different Number of Years ; they said he was brought up as a Surgeon by his Father , and they never heard of his having behaved ill . Some of the Witnesses having entrusted him , they found him honest , and said they should be under no Apprchen sion of being wrong 'd , tho ' they should trust him again . Both guilty , Death . 135 , 136. Sarah Burges and Ann Hill were indicted , ( with Ann Holloway not taken ) for assaulting George Moody , in the Dwelling-House of Sarah Burges , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Hat , val . 6 s. a Cane , val . 1 s. a Silk Handkerchief , val . 1 s. a pair of Gloves , val . 1 s. and 4 l. 6 d. in Money , December 10 . George Moody . I came out of the country , 20 Miles off , and on the 10th of Dec. about 4 or 5 o'clock , I came from my Son 's in St Giles 's . I had desired him to shew me the Way to Lincoln's-Inn , but he only directed me down this Lane , ( Drury-lane ) and when I came to the Globe Tavern -Door , there were 3 Women standing there . I asked them the Way to Lincoln's-Inn ? One of them took hold of me and said , - This is the Way ; and they carry 'd me to the farther End of the House . I told them , I thought it had been a Thorough-fair ; No , said they , but we must have a Glass of Wine before we part . I refus 'd to have any Wine , and said I would not drink any , for I had no Money to pay for Wine . Nan Hill said , she would find Money . Sarah Burges , ( the Woman who keeps the House ) Nan Hill , and Nan Holloway were then present ; and Hill fell immediately to rifle my Pockets , while Burges and Holloway held me down in a chair . This was done in a Back Room , the farthest from the Street : and they took from me the things mentioned in the Indictment . - 4 s. 6d . in Money , a Handkerchief , and a Bundle of Writings which were in my Pocket . After this I went into the Street , and enquired who kept that House , but no body would tell me , - I believe they were all of a Sort , and would not betray one another . Hill came after me into the Street , with the Writings in her Hand , and said , If I would come in again , I should have them . I follow 'd her for my Writings , and I had no sooner got into the House , but she took the Hat off my Head , and gave it a Fellow to keep for the Recitcning ; though I saw no Man in the House 'till I came back again . Prisoners . What did you drink in the House ? Moody . Burges told me 4 Pints had been drank , but I do n't know what became of them , I do n't know that I saw any one of them . I believe I might drink one Glass , and I believe that was all , - I ca n't be positive . They left me 3 penny-worth of Halfpence in my Pocket , and that was all . With this Money I went over the Way to a publick House , and called for a Pint of Beer , and asked the Names of the People at the Globe over the Way , but they would not tell me , and made me pay the Three-Pence ( the others had left me ) for the Pint of Drink . The next Morning I went to Burges , to ask her for my Writings ; but she call 'd me old Rogue , and told me there were 3 Pints of Wine to be pay 'd for . Why , says I , you serv 'd your selves ; what Money I had , you took from me ; but I could not get my Writings , so I went and got a Warrant for them ; and 2 or 3 Days afterwards I sent 3 Men to the House , and desired them to call for Wine , and Women , and I would come ( I said ) and surprise them with a Constable . The Men went thither , and had each of them a Woman , but when I came , I found they were not the Women who had robb 'd me . Burges . How long after this was it , before you took us up ? Moody . I went the next Day to enquire for my Things , and took out a Warrant for them the next Day , but I could not take them presently , for they all kept out of the Way ; and I live in the Country , and could not stay in Town . Beside , Burges desired me to stay a Week , before I put the Warrant in Execution , that she might find out my Things , and accordingly I did . Burges . Did you pay no Money that Night towards the Reckoning ? Moody . No ; I had no Money to pay any Reckoning with . Moses Moody . My Father call 'd upon me when he came up out of the Country , and after he had stay 'd about 2 Hours with me , he ask 'd me which was his nearest Way to Lincoln's-Inn ? It might be then about 4 o'Clock , or a little before . I live in Belton-Street , so I directed him to Long-Acre , and a-cross Drury-Lane to Princes-Street . The next Morning he told me , he had been robb 'd at the Globe in Drury-Lane , and desired me to go with him to the House . When I came there , Burges was in the Bar , and she abused us , and called him old Rogue , upon his asking her for the Things she had taken from him . She said he had taken his Things away himself ; but I told her I would get a Warrant for her , and for the People who had been concerned in the Fact ; and accordingly I went in order to get one , but not knowing all their Names , it was to no Purpose . So I went back again to Burges , and she sent for Hill and Holloway , and told me their Names , and then I got a Warrant : I had desired them to let me have the Writings , else they would all come into Trouble . Hill said , she had given my Father the Writings again ; but Nan Holloway told me , before Burges 's Face , that Burges kept them for a Halfcrown Reckoning : though Burges said she had them not , nor knew any Thing of them . When the Warrant was taken out , they sent for me to the Nag's-Head-Tavern , in Prince's-Street , where I found Burges , and she desired me to stop the Execution of the Warrant , and said , perhaps she might get the Writings again . Burges . When you came the next Morning , did not I tell you the other Womens Names ? Moody , jun . I had some Words with her , and told her the Justice said , if she would not tell their Names , he would send for Her . I knew her Name ; it is under the Sign of the Globe . Burges . Pray what were these Writings ? Moody , sen . There was a Bill of Sale for 60 l. and a Note for 20 l. Burges . Moody came into the House , and asked for a Pint of Wine , I was very ill at the same Time . - He went into a Room behind the Bar , and said he wanted to drink with a Woman [ Holloway ] who was with me in the Bar . She went to him , and they had a Pint of White , and a Pint of Red , and after this they had 2 Pints more , and when he went away he paid me half a Crown , and told me , if he was alive and well , he would come again , and pay me the other Eighteen-Pence . As for my Name , it has been wrote under the Sign , ever since I left off keeping a Brandy-Shop . When he came to me , he desired me to advertise the Writings , and said I should be at the Expence of it ; and accordingly his Writings were advertised three Weeks in the Papers ; and when the Justice sent for me , I went to him , and came back again to my own House . This is the Paper which his Son wrote with his own Hand . Moody , jun . When they sent for me to Graham 's , at the Nag's-Head in Prince's-Street , they desired me to advertise the Writings , and Graham desired me to write the Advertisement my self . While I was with them at this House , I sent a Letter to my Father , to know what I should do ; but he did not come to me before next Morning , and then he said , he did not care what they did , so he had but his Papers again . They told me , if I would write the Advertisement , they would be at the Charge of publishing it . My Father knew nothing of my Writing the Advertisement , for he was out of Town . William Norman . I am a Journeyman Bricklayer , and my Master 's Name is Ridge . I was at work that Evening in Colson 's Court , and my Master ordered me to wait for him when I had done Work , at the Bar of the Globe-Tavern . 'T was on Monday the 10th or 11th of December , and I remember I went thither , and looked at the Clock , and saw it was between 5 and 6 o'Clock . Mrs Burges told me , I might as well sit down by the Bar-Fire ; so I went in , and Hill and another Woman came in , and Moody followed them . Moody said , Pray do n't let me disturb you ; I said , No , you do n't disturb me , and so I went and sat down in the Bar . Burges carry 'd them in 3 Pints of Wine , and when she had carried in the third , she told me , she believed she should lose some part of her Reckoning , for the Man ( said she ) has but half a Crown in his Pockets . When he came out , he asked her her Name ; she told him , her Name was at the Bottom of the Sign ; so he went out , and said he would call again , and pay her what he had left to pay . He followed the Gentlewomen into the House voluntarily , and not as if he was enquiring his Way . He was in the House about an Hour with the Women , and seemed to be a little in Liquor , but did not say one Word , either pro or con , about being robb 'd , when he went away . I stay 'd in the House 'till within a Quarter of 12 , and supp 'd with Burges upon Sausages ; and no Man came into the House , from the Time he went out , to my going Home . Mary Broderick . I have been a Servant to Burges upward of 7 Years . I remember the Time when Moody came into our House , Hill came in with him , and no body else * . They went into the Parlour , where Norman the Bricklayer was sitting , and drank 2 or 3 Pints of Wine , which Moody called for himself . * See Norman 's ( the Bricklayer 's ) Evidence . Burges . Was any Force made Use of toward him ? Broderick . No , none at all . He came forcibly in , without asking any Questions , and Hill was with him . Our House is no Thorough-fair : but he did not pretend to want a Thorough-fair : he stay 'd about an Hour , bid us good Night , as then went away very friendly and kindly ask 'd my Mistress her Name ; telling her , call again and pay her , the next Time he Town . I did not see any Money pay 'd , be sure he pay 'd half a Crown , for my M Burges would not say it , if he had not . I am Servant there , - my Business is sometime above , and sometimes below , - well , I am Cook who and I am sure there was no other Woman made Company that Night , but my Mistress , and the Prisoner Hill . There was no one else in the House , but this Norman , and another Servant , at that Time . Margaret Nokes . I live at Burges 's , at the Globe-Tavern , and when the Countryman came in , I was sitting in the Back-Room with her and Norman . He came in with Nan Hill and Nan Holloway , and did not ask the Way to any Place , but called for Wine , and they had 4 Pints ; and when he went away , he said nothing , but only wish 'd my Mistress a Good-Night . - I ca n't tell whether he was drunk or sober , - I take it he was a little in Liquor . Burges . If there had been any hauling him , and holding him , while his Pocket was pick 'd , should not you have heard it ? Nokes . He did not complain of it then . But next Morning he came and ask 'd my Mistress , if he had not left a Bundle of Writings there ? She told him no , - but he had left Eighteen-Pence to pay . Upon which he told her , that he had no Money at all about him when he came in there over-Night , so ( he said ) he could not have paid any Thing . He came indeed the second Time the same Day , and then he said he had been robbed . Sarah Clayton . I happened to go that Night to see what a-Clock it was , by Mrs Burges 's Dial . Just as I was at the Door , the Countryman came out , and trod upon my Toe . He asked my Pardon , and said he hoped he had not hurt me ; no Sir , says I , if you have not hurt your self . Then he turned about and said , your humble Servant , I wish you a good Night . After this I went across the Way to speak to a Woman , - I do not know her , but I take it she keeps a publick House , and I saw him go into the same House , and speak to a Woman , - but I do not know her neither , and there was no complaint that Night , but he went away very civilly . This was as I take it to be , on the 10th or 11th of December . Alexander Watson . All I know of the Matter , my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury , is this . On Tuesday I saw this Moody walking about our Court , with his Hat on ; - I live in Windsor Court over against Mrs Burges 's . - Says one of my Neighbours , that Man has been walking here this Hour . What 's the Matter with you , Friend , says I ? Why says he , I have been out late , and have lost some Papers of some Consequence to me . Where was it you lost them ? I was over the Way at the Globe ( says he ) and at 2 or 3 more Places ; but I do n't know where I lost them . I asked him if he had left any Money ? No , he said he had none to lose . Can you recollect , says I , whether the Woman of the House took any Money from you ? No , said he , she did not . Well , says I , I 'll go over the Way and ask her . I did so and she said she knew nothing of his Papers . When I came back , I saw this young Fellow ( Moody , jun . ) walking with him ; and I told them the Woman of the House knew nothing of them , but she said he had left Eighteen-Pence to pay . Why , says the old Fellow all we want is to know her Name , then we shall do very well , for she has Money enough ; and he told me likewise , that I was one of them , and that we were all alike . - I was an Upholsterer by Trade , but I am an Officer now . John Lawley . I keep a publick House ; the Sign of the Greybound , over against Burges 's . This young Man came into my House , and the old one followed him . The young one asked if a Man had not left a Hat , Cane , and Papers there last Night ? I said not as I know of , but I 'll call my Wife : And the old Man told her , he believed he was a little in Drink , and left a small Matter to pay . My Wife told him no , he had left nothing there . Then , says he , I am not positive , but I am sure I left them somewhere hereabouts . I wo n't accuse you , for I do n't know where they were left . William Lorrington . I have known Burges 8 or 9 Years ; I have worked for her , and she has paid me honourably . I have been in her House abundance of Times , - I have been there late , and have been used well , and with good Manners indeed . - I do not know Hill . George Mascal . I have known Burges about 3 Years . I never knew any ill of her , as to pilsering and thieving ; and I have spent many a Pound there too . As to Hill , I know no harm of her , in that way . William Brown . I have served Burges with Bread about a Twelve-month , and she has paid me honestly . I know nothing of Hill . William Raven . I keep a Turner 's Shop within 3 Doors of Burges : I have known her about 8 or 9 Years . What Goods she had of me , she always paid me for . I ca n't say I have heard of her being a Pick-pocket . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 137 . + John Lineham was indicted , ( with Teddy Brian , Henry Smith , and John of Gaunt , not taken ) for assaulting David Patten , Esq ; on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Cane with a gold Head , val . 5 l. 5 s. November 4 . The Witnesses , at the Request of the Prisoner , were examined apart . Mr Patten . On Sunday the 4th of November , between 6 and 7 in the Evening , under the Arch at the Bottom of Earl's-Court , by Bow-street in Covent-Garden , I received a Blow , on the back-part of my Head , with something very heavy , which sunk me on my left Knee . As I endeavoured to rise , I had a second Blow , which laid me flat upon the Ground . Upon attempting to rise again , I had 2 Blows more . I was very much stunned with the first Blow , but I endeavoured to ward off the other Blows , with my Cane , before I fell down . As I got up , I had a Blow or 2 more , and my Cane was forced out of my Hand : it had a gold Head of about 5 Guineas value . Prisoner . Was it a wrought Head , or a plain one ? Mr Patten . A wrought Head . - I endeavoured to draw my Sword , but my Right-Hand was so disabled , by warding off the Blows , that I could not draw it . It was exceeding dark , and I could see but one Man , who appeared in a Sea-Man 's Jacket and Trowsers . I got up to Bow-street , and called out Thieves ! Murder ! And several Chair-Men standing at a Coffee-House Door at the Bottom of Earl's-Court , went after them ; they could find no-body , but they brought me my Hat , which they said was lying in a dark Place , and it seems was not carry 'd off . Prisoner . What Cloaths did you wear that Night ? Mr Patten . This very same brown coat , which I have on now ; this Wig , and this Hat . Prisoner . Was it not under the Roof of a House ? Mr Patten . It was under the Arch . Prisoner . Was it a dark , or a clear Night ? Mr Patten . It was a clear Night ; but the Moon was then under a Cloud , and I was in a dark Place . James Thompson . About 13 Weeks ago , or something better , I , and the Prisoner , Henry Smith , Teddy Brian , and a hump-backed Boy , who goes by the Name of John of Gaunt , went out from Mrs Lambert 's , in Parker 's Lane , to the 2 blue Posts , near Drury-Lane , - Prisoner . Speak out , I can not hear him swear my Life away . Thompson . We went from thence round Covent-Garden , and coming up Bow-street , we saw a Gentleman , near the End of Earl's-Court ; he was coming out of the Court between 7 and 8 in the Evening . Teddy Brian went after him , and gave him a Blow with a Bludgeon , which he carried under his coat : and he afterwards gave him several other Blows about the Head . I , and Henry Smith were at the same Time , on the other side of the Way , about 6 or 8 Yards off . Prisoner . Was Brian before the Gentleman or behind him ? Thompson . He was behind him when he gave him the first Blow , and then the Gentleman turned about , and defended himself with his cane , but Brian gave him several Blows after that , and at last he fell : whether it was by a Blow or a Slip , I ca n't tell . As soon as the Gentleman fell , Brian snatched his cane out of his Hand , and then he recovered himself a little , and drew his Sword ; upon which Brian ran over to us , with the cane in his Hand . The Prisoner stood by Brian while he was attacking the Gentleman , with a Bludgeon in his Hand , to assist him in case any Body should come by . It was agreed we should all be ready in case of any Resistance . After this , we all went to Mrs Lambert 's ; and in the Fore-room we agreed , that the Prisoner and Smith should offer the cane to her . Accordingly they carried it to her , in the Backroom , while I , Teddy Brian , and John of Gaunt , waited in the Fore-room . We agreed they should ask her a Guinea for it , but they came and told us she offered no more than 7 s. for she said the Head was only washed over . At first they said , they would not take the Money she bid , but at length we took it , and 4 of us had Eighteen-pence a-piece , and John of Gaunt had a Shilling . Prisoner . What Sort of a Night was it ? And what Time o'Night ? Thompson . It was a Star-light Night : and between 7 and 8 o'Clock . Prisoner . Where did John of Gaunt stand ? Thompson . He stood for a Spy , at the End of the Street . Prisoner . Ask him if he knows the Gentleman who was robbed ? Thompson . I believe that is the Gentleman ; 't is like him . ( Pointing to Mr Patten . ) Prisoner . What cloaths had I on ? Thompson . A brownish Coat and Waistcoat , and under these , a flannel Waistcoat . Prisoner . What Cloaths had Brian ? Thompson . A blue-grey coat , and a blackish Wig . James Purvis . I happened to be drinking at Moll Lambert 's in Parker's-Lane , one Sunday Night , about 2 Months ago , and about 8 o'Clock at Night , Lineham and Smith came into the Back-room , and called Moll Lambert out of the Fore-room to them there . I was in the Back-room at the same Time , and saw them offer to sell her a cane . They asked her a Guinea for it ; she stood some Time , and then she said it was only gilt , and she would give but 7 s. for it . John of Gaunt , Brian , and Thompson were at the same Time in the Fore-room ; they all came into the House together , but these 3 staid in the Fore-room , while the Prisoner and Smith went into the Back-room . After Lambert had bid them 7 s. they went into the Fore-room , to ask the other 3 , if they should take the Money . Prisoner . How came you to know what passed in the Fore-room ? Purvis . I was drinking in the Back-room ; and when Lineham and Smith returned out of the Back-room to the rest , I was willing to know something of the Matter , and I went with them into the Fore-room , where they agreed to take the Money , and it was shared among them ; it was Twenty-pence or Eighteen-pence . - I think it was Sixteen-pence a-piece . This John of Gaunt they did not use to give any thing to , except a little Victuals and Drink . After they had divided the Money among them , I went up 2 Pair of Stairs with them , and won 3 Shillings of them at All-fours . Prisoner . What coat had I on then ? Purvis . At that Time he had a red rug coat on . He used to wear one coat one Night , and another , another Night . Prisoner . I have no Witnesses , but I am innocent of the thing . How can I have Witnesses to swear I know nothing of it : it is impossible I should have any Witnesses to that . Guilty , Death . + He was a second Time indicted , ( with Henry Smith not taken ) for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of William Green , between 2 and 3 in the Night and stealing a Side of Bacon , value 15 s. November 1 . Guilty , Death . 138 . + Susannah Jones was indicted for the Murder of Edward Marsault , an Infant , about 8 Weeks old , by giving it a mortal Wound with a Razor , on the left Side of the Neck , of the Length of 2 Inches , and the Depth of one Inch , which Wound it instantly died , Dec. 17 . She was a second Time charged , by Virtue of the Coroner 's Inquest , for the said Murder . Elizabeth Frost gave an Account , that she went out and left the Prisoner to take Care of the Deceased , who lay asleep in a Cradle , and 2 other Children , who were on the Bed . That she return 'd in an Hour , and found the youngest Child murder 'd behind the Cradle , and the Prisoner told her , ( upon her enquiring after it ) that she had killed it ; because she ( Frost ) had told her , she would not take her in again when she came out of Place . Upon the Prisoner 's asking her if she had not observ 'd her to have been out of her Senses , she informed the Court , that she had appear 'd fretful and uneasy , but she did not take her to be out of her Senses . Elizabeth Legg confirm 'd part of the above Evidence , and added , that the Prisoner told her , she had cut the Child 's Throat with a Razor , which she found in the Table-drawer . Samuel Tuttle gave the same Account , and added , that the Prisoner told him , she thought somebody spoke to her , and bid her do it ; and that she acknowledg 'd , she took the Child out of the Cradle with an Intent to kill it , but having some Remorse , she laid it down again ; but in a few Minutes it crying vehemently , she took it up again , and cut it 's Throat with the Razor , which she afterwards laid in the Corner of the Window . Her Confession ( to this Purpose ) before Colonel De Veil , was read in Court , but Anthony Benn and Robert Benn , giving the Prisoner the Character of a sober , well-behav 'd Girl , not addicted to Cruelty ; and Elizabeth Sanders speaking to some Symptoms of a disorder 'd Mind in the Prisoner , the Jury acquitted her , and found her Lunatick . 139 . + Mary Chapman , alias Johnson , was indicted for stealing 7 Yards 3 Quarters of Cambrick , value 40 s. the Goods of John Higgins , in his Shop , January 13 . Mary Higgins . I live at the Lion and Lamb , a little beyond Chancery-Lane End , by Temple-Bar , and keep a Linnen-Draper's-Shop , on Account of my Husband . I had formerly lost a great many Goods , and hearing somebody in the Shop , I came up out of my Kitchen , which is under the Shop , and seeing a Woman there , with a young Infant in her Arms , I stood upon the Watch , because there was a pretty many Goods on the Counter . The Prisoner was buying some Cambrick , and a Box of Cambricks being by her , I saw her hustle toward it , and throw the child 's cloaths over the Box . Then I saw her put her Hand under the child 's cloaths , and draw up a Piece of Cambrick , which she kept for 10 Minutes , or a Quarter of an Hour , and then she made off from the counter with it , and asked my Brother Wiseham , who serves in the Shop , for some Nun 's Holland . I gave him an Item , that she had stole some Cambrick out of the Box ; he , being surpriz 'd , told her he had none that would do for her . Upon this she made off with the Piece of Cambrick towards the Door , but seeing me surpriz 'd , and that I whispered him , she came back , and dropped the Piece of Cambrick a-cross the Box , which stood 3 if not 4 Yards from the Street-Door . I saw her bring the child to the Box , and saw her drop it ; after which she went away , and I was angry with my Brother for not laying hold of her in the Shop , but he went after her , and took her . Prisoner . I bought 2 Bits of Cambrick , and paid for them . Mrs Higgins . Yes , she bought 2 half-quarters , and paid Sixteen-Pence for them ; but what she stole , was a whole Piece un-open 'd ; and she took it up under the child 's cloaths , while she was buying the other . William Wiseham . I serve in the Shop : on Friday se'ennight the Prisoner came in , and asked for some Packet-cambrick , of 5 s. a Yard , with a child in her Arms . I fetch 'd a Box , and snewed her some ; Sir , says she , be so good as to hold the child , while I look at it at the Door ; I did so , and we agreed for 4 s. and 6 d. a Yard . I asked her how much she wanted ? She told me half a quarter , and I said then she must give me Seven-pence for it . She had the child in her left Hand , and she shov 'd some Goods , which were on the counter , farther from the Door , and said , May be , Sir , my child may piss upon them , and damage them . I guess 'd what Sort of a Customer I had got , for just such a Woman as she came with a child , a little while ago , and stole 5 Yards of cambrick . I did not cut off the cambrick she had agreed for , for she said she would have finer , and would go to 6 s. a Yard . So I went to an opposite counter , and fetch 'd another Box , which I plac 'd about a Yard from the Prisoner , on her left-hand , in which were 12 Pieces , 10 within Papers , and 2 without Paper . And as I went toward the Door , to shew her the cambrick , I saw her hand toward the Box , and hearing the rustling of the cambrick under the child 's cloaths , I was terrify 'd . Then she pointed up to a strip 'd Thing , and asked me what it was ; and after this she asked for Nun 's Holland ; but I told her it would be too high for her ; and expected her to go out of the Shop with what she had stole , because I thought the Law would have run more against her , if she had carry 'd them out of the Shop * . So I waited for her going ; but she returned from the Door , and said she would look on the Nun 's Holland ; and presently she hustled up to the Box , and I heard the rattling of the cambrick upon the Box . Then she went away and said , the Nun 's Holland would not do for her . She did not take either of the 2 Pieces which lay uppermost in the Box , without Paper , but had the Art to take a Piece under them , which was paper 'd . After she was gone , my Sister bid me go after her , and a Gentleman coming into the Shop , he said he would go too . So we watch 'd her into an Alehouse , the Lion and Cat , and took her . I am sure she had the cambrick under the child 's cloaths near a Quarter of an Hour , before she dropped it into the Box again . * The Witness was mistaken ; for removing Goods , with a felonious Intention , though they should not be carried off , is Felony . Jury . When you found the cambrick , was it in the Box ? William Wiseham . I found it a-cross the Top of Box . - When she was before the Justice , he knew her , and said , - Are you come again ! He said her Name was Johnson , and that she had been transported about a Year and three Quarters ago . Thomas Wiseham . I went with the Prisoner before the Justice , where she did not deny she took the Goods , but only said , they had found nothing upon her . The Justice knew her , and told her so , and that she had been a Notorious Offender . When she was ordered to Newgate , I was forced to go and get a Party of Soldiers , before we could get her thither . I have heard of this very Woman 's robbing with a Child , from Mrs Wright in Holborn and several other Shopkeepers , and gave my Brother and Sister a particular Caution about her . Mary Bates , had known the Prisoner between 2 and 3 Years , as a good Civil Neighbour in Bloomsbury . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. 140 . + Alice Cook alias Taper , was indicted for privately stealing a Guinea , and 2 s. and a Farthing from the Person of Christopher Blinkhorn , January 13 . Blinkhorn . On Sunday Night last , about half an Hour after 10 , I was coming along Knaves-Acre , and met the Prisoner . Where are you going ( says she ) so much in a Hurry ? Home , says I , and what have you to say to that ? Will you give me any Thing , quoth she ? I have but a few Halfpence , said I , and I asked her a very impudent Question , that I believe I did ; and told her I had got Two-pence , but she must be quick , for I was in a Hurry , and had not much Occasion for her Company neither . So I gave her the Two-pence , and then she pretended that Two-pence was too little . Well , says I , I 'll see if I have any more Farthings , and so I gave her 2 Halfpence more . But while I was talking to her , she got her Hand into my Pocket , and took out a Guinea , 2 Shillings and a Farthing . After this , I told her directly she had picked my Pocket ; she denyed it , but I took her to the next Alehouse , and called a Watchman . When the Watchman came , I told her she had picked my Pocket of a Guinea , 2 Shillings and a Farthing , and if she would give me the Money again , I would release her ; if not , I would send for the Constable . Nay , I told her , if she would return me the Guinea , she should have the overplus for her self , but she would not own it ; so the Constable was sent for , and I delivered her up to him . He carry 'd her to the Watch-house , and there she was searched , but no Money was to be found . At last says the Beadle , these Creatures very often hide Things in their Stockings , and upon searching the Stocking on her right Leg , out came the Guinea , 2 Shillings and a Farthing , to be sure . Next Morning we had her before Sir Edward Hill , and there she own 'd the Money to be mine , and that she had robbed me of it , and begged my Pardon . Prisoner . This Man has offered me Money a great many Times , I serve the House in Grosvenor Square , where he lives , with Fish and Oysters . John Yarmouth . Last Sunday Night about a quarter before 11 , a Watchman came to the Watch-house to fetch the Constable to the Barley-mow , in Knaves-Acre . I went with him , and there sat Blinkhorn and the Prisoner , and 2 other Men by them : And without Doors there was a couple of their Fosticates intending to get in , but we shut the Door against them . They told us they belonged to this very self same Creature at the Bar , and the Constable ordered me to disperse them , and I did so . Then Blinkhorn told the Creature , if she would give him the Guinea , she should have the 2 Shillings and the Farthing for her self ; but it signified nothing , - she was cafe-hardened . So Mr Constable and I were both of one Opinion , and that was , that she should be taken proper care of . Accordingly I took hold of one of her Hands , and another Brother Watchman took hold of the other Hand , to guard her down to the Watch-house . But we had not gone far , before these 2 Fosticates came swearing upon us again : However we got the creature to the Watch-house , where we desired her to give the Man his Money : She said she had it not , so we examined her , and searched her modestly , but found no Money . Upon that says I , here 's a proper Place to search , meaning her Shoes and Stockings . So with all the Pleasure in the World , Madam pulled off her 2 Shoes ; and one Stocking as quick as her Shoes , and that was quick enough ; and by the same Token she had large Buckles in them . But when she came to untye her Right Garter , or a Peice of White Tape , she was not so quick . I would not be obstinate , but said , Madam , if you please I 'll help you ; and so I turned down her Stocking , and out dropped a Guinea , 2 Shillings and a Farthing . The next Morning she was carried before his Worship , and there she begged the Coachman 's Pardon , and said , she would never do so no more . Acquitted . 141.
