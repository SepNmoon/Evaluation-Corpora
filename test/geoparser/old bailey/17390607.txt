William Pattison of St. Butolph , Aldgate , was indicted for stealing three Glass Globe Lamps , value 15 s. the Goods of Persons unknown , May 16 . John Vaughan . I have seen the Prisoner bring Lamps into my Room , in Lambeth-Rents , in Petticoat-Lane . About five Weeks ago , I saw him bring a Globe Lamp in his Apron into the Room , about two o'Clock in the Morning : I ca n't remember the Day of the Month , but 't was the Day the Charity-Children walked to Christ-Church . I saw him pull it out of his Apron and set it down on the Dresser : Then He , and William Greenaway 's Brother , called up Greenaway out of his Bed , and asked him , if he would go out with them to get more , and they all went out again on that Design . The Prisoner had formerly lodged in the House , but had left his Lodging there , some Time before the Fact was committed . Zaccheus Bourn . About seven Weeks ago we lost seven Lamps out of our Ward , and upon Enquiry after them , I heard that some disorderly Persons had a Lodging in a little Alley , in Petticoat-Lane . On the 15th of May I went to this Room , having been directed to it by a Watch-man , and found five or six Fellows playing at Cards , but there was neither Chair , Table , nor Stool in it . William Greenaway told me he belonged to the Room , and upon looking about , I saw a Heap of Rags , under which , I found six Rims of Lamps . Greenaway told me they belong 'd to him , that he was a Lamp-Lighter , and lit Lamps in Thames-street . I told him we had lost several Lamps , and that I must take him into Custody . I seized him accordingly , and he was committed to Bridewell as a Disorderly Person , because the Tin Man could not swear to the Rims . The next Morning I went again to the same Room , and took Vaughan , the Evidence . As I brought him down Stairs , he told me he had a Favour to beg of me ; which was , that I would intercede for him , that he might be made an Evidence . Prisoner . I was coming along , and saw two or three Fellows upon some Lamp Posts , and they asked me to take down one or two for them ; I was in Liquor , and took one down , which I carry 'd for them to this House : Then they ask 'd Will . Greenaway to get up , and go out with them again for more ; he did so , and they all went out again , but I did not know what they were about , for I was in Liquor the same Time . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 328. William Greenaway was indicted for stealing three Glass Globe Lamps , val . 15 s. the Goods of the , in the Parish of St. Stephen , Coleman-street , May 16 . He was a second time indicted for stealing seven Glass Globe Lamps val . 35 s. the Goods of the same , in the Parish of St. Butolph , Aldgate : And He was a third time indicted for stealing nine Glass Globe Lamps , val . 45 s. the Goods of the same , in the Parish of St. Butolph , Bishopsgate , May 16 . Guilty on each Indictment . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 329. Thomas Hill was indicted for stealing an Iron Grey Mare , val . 15 l. the Property of John Warren May 24 . Mr. Warren . In August last my Mare was at Grass , in the Parish of Stapleton , about four Miles beyond Bristol : She was a genteel Mare , between a Nutmeg and an Iron Grey . The Farmer under whose Care she had been for about a Month before , sent me Word that she was missing the 2d of August , upon which I advertised her , but had no Information of her in several Months : But at last one Mr. Jakes , who lives at Leeds in Yorkshire , ( and who had formerly been the Owner of her ) wrote me Word that he had seen my Mare at Mr. Stokes 's , at the Flying-Horse without Bishopsgate ; upon which I came up to London , and went to Mr. Stokes , who told me he had bought such a Mare of an Old Man he knew but very little of , and that she was then at Grass . I then sent one Robert Davis , to see the Mare : He inform 'd me she was mine , and she was brought to Mr. Stokes 's : I knew her , and demanded her , and got a Warrant to take up Stokes ; but he produced the Prisoner , and said , he was the Man who sold him the Mare . I know nothing at all of the Prisoner Geo Stokes . I live at the Flying Horse without Bishopsgate , and keep Livery Stables there . About the Middle of September last I was at Wandsworth ; and there I saw the Prisoner , who told me he had a pretty Mare to sell . I went into a Stable , and when I had seen her , I ask 'd him what she was worth ? He ask 'd me 11 l. and I bid him 7 l. or seven Guineas , but he not being inclinable to take my Money , I came home . In about a Week 's Time he brought her to my Stables , and set her at Livery , desiring me to help him to a Customer for her if I could , and telling me she was his Property : But one Morning when he came to see her , I told him , I would buy her myself , if we could agree upon Price , and in Talking I bid him 8 l. and at last eight Guineas , which he took for her ; this was about the 29th of September last . The Mare for which I paid this Money to the Prisoner , is the same that Mr. Warren afterwards own 'd . I did not ask the Prisoner how he came by her , for when I saw him at Wandsworth , I found he was an Acquaintance of my Brother-in-Law 's there , and upon that Account I had no Suspicion of him . I had had her about a Fortnight , before Mr. Warren came to enquire after her , and had put her to Grass at Plastow , for she was very poor when I bought her . I believe I told Mr. Warren at first , who I bought her of , and about two Days after he had claim 'd her , the Prisoner come into my Yard , and I took him . Robert Davis . I was Mr. Warren 's Servant , and came to live with him last Christmas was Twelve-Months . I know my Master had this Mare one Quarter of a Year in the Time I liv 'd with him . I found her in a Field at Plastow , at Grass : Mr. Stokes came to me at Plastow , and I told him the Mare was Mr. Warren 's : Upon which we both return 'd to his Stables , and the Mare was deliver 'd to me . Prisoner . I was going along Thames Street one Day in August , and met one John Pritchard , who lives in Southwark ; I had been acquainted with the Man this seven or eight Years at Times , and he ask 'd me to buy this Mare , which he was then leading in the Street ; I told him , she was very poor , and I did not know what to do with her . He said he had work 'd her very hard , and as he was going over to Holland , and wanted Money , I should have her for eight Guineas : I told him 't was too much Money for her , for she was very poor , and a little lame ; but at last we went to the Black Bull Alehouse , and there he agreed I should have her for six Guineas . I paid him the Money in the Alehouse , and took a Receipt for it before two or three People , and spent a Shilling in the House . I drive a Cart at Queen-Hithe , and have work 'd there twenty Years . At that Time I wanted a Horse for my own Use ; for I buy and sell Corn , and serve a great many Gentlemen 's Servants with Corn . When I sold Mr. Stokes this Mare , I told him I bought her of a Man who deals to Holland , and when she was claim 'd , I surrender 'd myself to him , without any Warrant , and sent to enquire after the Man I bought her of as soon as I could , but he is not to be found . Hugh Catterel . About August last I and John Stubbs were drinking at the Black Bull , and the Prisoner came in with one whom he called Pritchard , the Mare was left at the Door , and they desired me to go out and look at her , which I did , and saw she was an Iron-grey Mare , very poor in Flesh : The Bargain was made before they came in , but I saw the Prisoner pay the other Man 6 l. 7 s. one Shilling of which was spent , and we witness 'd the Receipt which the Prisoner took for the Money . I never saw either of the Men before that Time in my Life , but I was desired to go and look at the Mare , and to witness the Receipt . This is the Receipt , and this is my Name , - Hugh Catterel . The Receipt was read . August 29 . 1738 . Received of Thomas Hill , the Sum of Six Pounds Seven Shillings , in full for a Mare , and all Demands , Witness . Hugh Catterel . per John Pritchard . John Stubbs . Catterel . I never had seen the Prisoner before , nor been in his Company ; nor have I ever seen him since , till he sent for me upon this Affair . I told him , when I witness 'd the Receipt , that I liv 'd at the Golden Lion in Russel street , Covent-Garden . John Stubbs confirm 'd Catterel 's Testimony . Hen . Froom , John Leman , William Froom , John Millet , and William Folbigg , gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest Man . Acquitted . 330. Margaret Bell was indicted for stealing a Mahogony Tea-chest , val . 18 d. three Walnut-tree Canisters , val . 6 d. and 1 Oz . of Green Tea , val . 9 d. the Goods of Magdalen Fountain , May 22 . Guilty , 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 331 , 332. James Caldclough and Joseph Morris were indicted for assaulting Josiah Swafford and George Banks on the King 's Highway , putting them in Fear , & c. and taking from the said Swafford a Hat , val . 2 s. two Guineas and 5 s. in Money ; and from the said Banks five Guineas and 13 s. in Money , Apr . 9 . Mr. Swafford . On the 9th of April , between Night and Nine in the Evening , I was going from Knightbridge to Kensington , and about 100 Yards beyond the Half-way House , three Men came up to me , dress 'd in Soldiers Cloaths ; ( two of them I am certain had Soldiers Cloaths on ) their Swords were drawn , and , without speaking a Word , they fell to cutting me , and never left cutting me , till they had brought me to the Ground ; they gave me all these Wounds [ in my Face ] and there are many more upon my Head . [ The Prosecutor shew 'd the Places where he had been wounded ] I had 24 Guineas in this Pocket , so I clapp 'd my Hand into it , while one of the Men thrust his Hand into the other Pocket , out of which he took two Half-crowns , and some Half-pence , and then said , - I have got it ! Then they went a little Way from me , and one of them came back immediately , and put his Hand into this Pocket where the Gold was , and took out two Guineas , leaving me 22 behind : I believe , when I put my bloody Hand into my Pocket , I might raise them up from the rest , and , perhaps , as I lay upon the Ground ; they might see them . When they had done this , they left me , and I saw no more of them . At that Time , when they cut me down , I was alone , and lay upon the Ground , till the Hostler at the Crown at Kensington took me up and carry 'd me to a House . How long I lay on the Ground I ca n't tell , but I believe it was not long before I was taken to the Dolphin , at the Gore in Kensington . After the Hostler had found me , several other Friends came up , and among them Mr. Banks , who was robbed the same Night . I told the People at the Gore that I had been robb 'd by three Soldiers , and what I had lost ; but I can not take upon me to say the Prisoners are the Men , for they cut me so fast , and the Blood flew about me in such a Manner , that I could not take Notice of them , so as to remember their Faces ; I saw three other Men before these Men were charged , but I could say nothing to them , nor can I swear to these . Coldlough . Had the Soldiers who robb 'd you their Accountrements on and their Spatterdashes ? Mr. Swafford . I can say nothing to that ; they gave me no Time to observe any thing , but came upon me without saying a Word , and fell upon me with their drawn Swords , till I dropt to the Ground . Geo . Banks . I live next Door to Mr. Swafford ; he is a Carpenter at Hammersmith , and he was robb 'd the 9th of April , between Knightsbridge and Kensington . I had been with him to London , and we were returning home between Eight and Nine that Night : When we came to the Half-way House , I stopp 'd to make Water , and Mr. Swafford walk 'd on , and was got some Distance before me . As I went after him , I saw three Men cutting another Man , but I did not know it was Mr. Swafford , so I endeavour 'd to pass by them , and as I was striving to get past them , the Prisoner Caldclough got hold of my Collar . I saw them actually cutting Mr. Swafford , and not knowing him , was endeavouring to get from them . There were three Men , and I think they had all Soldiers Cloaths on , but I ca n't say I saw any more than two Swords drawn , nor did I then observe that Mr. Swafford was bloody . I am positive to Caldclough , and that he had his Sword drawn , but I can say nothing to the other Prisoner . Cald lugh . Was it light , or dark ? Banks . Very Moonlight : The Evening was just closing . I had got five or six Yards from them , when Caldclough came up to me : I asked him what he wanted ? And immediately the two others who were robbing Mr. Swafford , left him , and came up to me . I endeavoured to get away from them , but Caldclough followed me , with his drawn Sword , and cut my Hat off my Head , which he himself took up directly . After Caldclough had seized me by the Collar , another of them came up , and they both thrust their Hands into my Pockets , and took out five Guineas and about 13 or 14 Shillings in Silver , and three Silver Pennies . When they had done with me , I made off towards Kensington , and they went back - towards Mr. Swafford , who was about five or six Yards distant from the Place where I was attack 'd . As I went homewards , I met a Friend , and asked him if he had seen Mr Swafford ? He told me , be came directly from Kensington , and had seen no body . I told him I had been robb 'd , and if he had not met him , I fear 'd he was murder 'd ; and upon going back to see for him , we found him wallowing in his Blood , and very much cut , and his Nose hanging into his Mouth : We got Help , and carry 'd him to the Dolphin at the Gore , and I went for a Surgeon . After we had seen proper Care taken of him , I went up to the Court , and desired Madam Keen , ( Mr. Loman 's Daughter ) to get the Roll called over , and upon calling over the Roll , three Soldiers were missing from the Guard , but the two Prisoners were then upon Duty . After the Roll had been called over , I went home ; and in the Morning I was sent to , and was informed that the three Men who were missing over Night , were then returned , and I went to see them , but could not swear to any of them ; however , they were carry 'd before Justice Hinson , and not giving a satisfactory Account where they had been , he committed them to Newgate , but they have since been bailed out . Three Weeks after this , I met one James , a Bricklayer , in the Strand , and he told me he believed the right Men were taken ; upon which I went with him to the Savoy , and saw Caldclough first : He was then in Custody , and I asked him if he knew me ? He said , - No . I told him he had seen me once too often , for he was the Man that had robbed me : He then desired me to do him no Hurt ; and I told him I would hurt him no farther than was consistent with Justice . Then I went to look at the Evidence , he lay on a Couch , but I could not swear to him ; nor could I charge the other Prisoner when I saw him . I asked the Evidence ( in the Savoy ) if he knew me ? He said , No , but I was very like the Man that he robb 'd ; and , if I was the same Person , I had then on a new Pair of Buck-skin Breeches , and that among the Money he took from me there were two Silver Pennies . There were three among the Money I was robb 'd of , but one of them we found next Morning on the Ground , in Mr. Swafford 's Blood . He told me farther , that he took two Guineas , and about nineteen Shillings in Silver from us both , beside the two Silver Pennies ; but I lost five Guineas , which another Man took out of my Pocket ; for there were two Men took Money out of my Pockets . He added , that Caldclough and Morris were the Men who were concerned with him in these Robberies ; but Morris told some Persons who were present , that he was innocent . Caldclough . Had we our Spatterdashes and Accoutrements on ? Banks . I think they all had Soldiers Cloaths on , and I believe they had Spatterdashes over their Stockings . I was 'frighted at the Time , - but I believe it was so . Caldclough Was it I or the other , that put the Hand into your Pocket ? Banks . There were two Men who put their Hands into my Pockets , I had five Guineas in my Right-Hand Pocket , and I am sure the Prisoner Caldclough 's Hand was in one of my Pockets , but who the other Man was , I ca n't tell . William Robinson . There were only Morris , Caldclough , and I , concerned in this Robbery . I am a Soldier , and we all belonged to Colonel Foliard 's Company . I remember it was the 9th of April , about half an Hour after Eight o'Clock . We had been drinking that Night at the Suttling House at St. James 's , and talked about going to the Gore , and robbing the first Person we should meet . Accordingly we went thro ' the Middle-Park , and along Kensington-Road 'till we came past the Half-way House . Then we looked back , and saw Mr. Swafford and Mr. Banks coming up . I did not know either of them then , - but the Persons we saw , prove to be these Gentlemen . When we first discovered them , they were Two or Three hundred Yards behind us ; upon which , we turn 'd back , and met them . Caldclough drew his Sword , and immediately fell to cutting Mr. Swafford . Q . Did you meet Mr. Swafford and Mr. Banks together ? Or , were they at any Distance asunder ? Robinson . We met them together , and Caldclough without saying any thing to Swafford , fell on him with his Sword . Morris 's Sword was likewise drawn , and he held it to Mr. Banks 's Breast . Mr. Swafford was about two or three Yards from Mr. Banks , when Caldclough fell upon him ( Swafford ) with his Sword , and gave him a great many Cuts . Morris held his Sword to Banks 's Breast , while I took the Money out of his Pocket . I had not a Sword with me , and was dressed in this Frock that I have on now ; but they both had their Soldiers Cloaths on . From Mr. Banks I took about 19 s. and two Silver Pennies ; I ca n't tell whether They took any more from him or not . From Mr. Swafford I took two Guineas in Gold , but not any Silver at all . Q . Did either of the other Persons take any Thing from Mr. Swafford ? Robinson . I do n't know : I ca n't say I observ 'd that . After this we went directly over the Hedges into the Fields , towards Chelsea , and when we got to Chelsea Horse-Ferry , we helped the Ferry Man to pull up the Drag . [ the Ferry-Boat ] and we crossed the Water to Lambeth , and under the Archbishop 's Wall , we divided the Money , and I had a Guinea for my Share . This was what I had for my Part of what I had taken , for they did not tell me they had taken any more . From Lambeth we came to Stangate , and there we crossed the Water again ; then we parted , and I went home . Some time after this Robbery , I was drinking in Dutchy-Lane , with one Richard Stephenson , and he disclosed that I had asked him to go with me on the Highway : This occasioned my being taken up , and then I discover 'd this Robbery ; but Caldclough was taken up before I was in Custody , though I can not tell how he came to be taken . Caldclough . Had we our Spatterdashes and Accoutrements on ? Robinson . No , they had not ; nor their Accoutrements - [ Their Leather Belts and Pouches . ] Caldclough . Then there is a Contradiction ; Mr. Banks said he lost 13 or 14 Shillings , and the Evidence says he took nineteen ; he said they all had Soldiers Cloaths and Spatterdashes . William Harris . On the 7th of April at Night , within a Quarter of Nine , I was going from London towards Kensington , and about a hundred Yards on the other Side the Half-way-House , I was stopped by three Soldiers , and saw them cut Mr. Swafford in a very barbarous Manner ; I was about a hundred Yards behind him , and to the best of my Knowledge , the three Men who attacked him , were all in Soldiers Cloaths . Two of them had Spatterdashes on , but I ca n't be positive whether the third had Spatterdashes on , or not . I saw two of them with drawn Swords cutting him down , and saw him fall with the Blows . I never saw Mr. Swafford before in my Life , and thought it had been a Quarrel , so I pushed up immediately , and saw two of them upon him , ( Swafford ) and the third Man ran directly to Banks , after which , one of them came up to me . Mr. Swafford was about ten or twelve Feet distant from Mr. Banks , at the Time when Banks was robbed . I ca n't swear to either of the Prisoners , but if either of the Prisoners were concern 'd , then I take it , That James Caldclough was the Man who stopped me with his drawn Sword , and demanded my Money , which I had in my Hand to give him , but as I had an Opportunity to push off , I got from them and lost nothing . I did not go forwards , but went back to the Half-way House , where I got a Stick , and returned to the Place , thinking to take the Men , but they were gone , and Swafford was lying upon the Ground ; I thought he had been dead . I ca n't swear to either of the Prisoners , but I believe Caldclough is the Man who stopped me . Caldclough . I ask this Witness , whether he did not charge one Ringal before Mr. Deveil , as the Man who stopped him ? Harris . He is a Soldier ; one of the three who were missing when the Roll was called over . I believed him to be the Man , and took him up on Suspicion . I can not swear Point-blank to any Man . Thomas Smith . I work at the Ferry at Chelsea . On the 9th of April , about a Quarter past Nine at Night , three Soldiers came down to the Ferry , and wanted to go over the Water . I desired them to lend a Hand , and help me to pull up the Drag ; they did so , and got in . Then they bid me pull away , pull away , - make Haste over ; this they said , all the Way they went . I landed them at Battersea-Ferry , and they asked me the Way to the King 's Arms . I do n't know the Men again , for though it was Moon-light , it was dull Moon-light , and cloudy : Two of them were in Soldiers Cloaths , and the other was not , but whether he had a Coat or a Frock on I ca n't tell ; for they hurry 'd me , and said they would give me 3 d. Farthing , which was seven Farthings more than my Fare ; and when we reach 'd Shore , they left the Money upon a Bench , and went away before I could get a-shore . Zephton Kitchen . I apprehended the Prisoners on the 10th of May , on this Occasion . A Soldier in the Company told me , the Prisoners had sold a Piece of melted Gold in Foster-Lane for 47 s. and the Person they offer 'd it too , refus 'd to let them have the Money for it , till one of the Serjeants in the Company came with them . This gave me some Suspicion of them , which was increas 'd by Richard Stevenson 's telling me , that Robinson had perswaded him to go out with him on the Highway ; and that he did go with him as far as Whitechappel , where Robinson bid him slouch his Hat , and told him they would go into the Fields and stop the first Man they should meet . Stevenson said he did go with him into the Fields , but watching an Opportunity , he ran from him , and got away . On the 10th of May , when our Company was waiting to mount Guard , Stevenson told my Brother Serjeant this Story . I thought it was proper the Affair should be enquired into , so I went to Somerset house Guard , and apprehended Caldlough that Evening ; for when Stevenson told me this concerning Robinson , he said , that Morris , Caldclough and Robinson , had all been concern 'd together . When I had seiz 'd Caldclough , and was carrying him to the Savoy , I talk 'd to him about these Robberies ; he deny 'd them all , but desired he might speak with Robinson the Evidence , which I refus 'd ; and when I had confin 'd him , I went to Robinson 's Quarters , in Dutchy-Lane , and the Surgeon of the Regiment coming in , I desired him to search Robinson 's Body , for he had not been able to perform Exercise , on Account of his Arms being bruised ; he was view 'd by the Surgeon , but the Bruises were almost worn out ; however , I seiz 'd him , in order to carry him to the Savoy , and advised him to confess and save himself . He said if I would carry him to Morris in Holborn , he would tell me all the Affair ; I consented , and before we got half Way to Holborn , he said he wish 'd he could save Morris , for he was an honest Fellow ; I bid him save himself , and tax 'd him with this Kensington Robbery , among others : He confess 'd it , and told me , Morris and Caldclough were both concern 'd with him in it . Upon this I turn 'd back , and carry 'd him directly to the Savoy : Then I went to Morris 's Lodgings in Fuller 's Rents in Holborn , and apprehended him . As I was going with him to the Savoy , I told him , Robinson had discover 'd the Persons concern 'd in the Robbery ; upon which he told me , 't was in my Power to do him some Service , and desired I would carry him before Mr. Deveil ; but I told him it would be to no Purpose , for Robinson had made the Discovery first , and was to be admitted an Evidence . Morris . Did I ask you to carry me to Mr. Deveil , or to Colonel Folliard ? Kitchen . I believe he first ask 'd me to carry him before Mr. Deveil , and afterwards said , - Let me go before my own Colonel ; I believe his Intent before either of them was to have made a Discovery . Richard Stevenson . On the Monday Night the Robbery was committed , I saw the two Prisoners , and the Evidence Robinson , drinking in St. James 's Suttling-house about Seven o'Clock ; I left them there , and had no Discourse with them about committing this , or any other Robbery . Robinson has talk 'd to me about going to rob with him , and I told Serjeant Aspinal of it : He [ Robinson ] and I were drinking three or four Pots of Two-penny one Day with a Girl , and he asked me to take a Walk with him ; I consented , and he asked me if I wanted Money , giving me at the same time two Half-crowns . As we went along , we drank another Pot of Two-penny , and he bid me either pay for it , or give him his Money again ; so I threw him down his two Half-crowns , and then we walked to Whitechappel ; where he asked me , if I was Man sufficient enough to rob , and to stand by him , if we should meet with any who might resist . I did go a little Way with him , and then gave him the Slip , and came home to my Quarters . Afterwards I told Serjeant Aspinal of it , and he was taken up . Jonathan Pye . I was the Corporal that kept ; the Roll . On the 9th of April the two Prisoners were upon Guard at St. James 's , and I saw them with the Evidence in the Suttling-house at Eight o'Clock at Night . I was upon Guard all Night , and did not see them any more , till between Eleven and Twelve , at which Time they return 'd to their Duty . The Royal Family went to the Play that Night , and the Guard turn 'd out on that Occasion : Several Men were absent , among whom were the Prisoners , and I return 'd them both at Ten o'Clock . I threaten 'd to return Caldclough at Four in the Afternoon ; for he was then playing at Cards in the Suttling house . Caldclough had no Witnesses in his Behalf . For Morris , one Ashforth appear 'd , who keeps an Alehouse at the Rising Sun in Tottenham Court Road : He gave an Account that Morris had liv 'd some Time with him , and he afterwards put him out Apprentice to Mr. Joseph Edmonston , a Sadler , in Holborn : That he serv 'd out his Time , and work 'd Journey-work for three Years since , and always behav 'd well , till he was drawn away by some of these Soldiers : That he inlisted three Years ago on Account of a Woman , and at the Time he inlisted he was sent out to receive a Bill for his Master , and after he had inlisted , he brought him every Farthing of the Money . Thomas Sherword , a Porter at Grays Inn Gate , and a Relation of Morris , said he had never heard any Harm of him , and that all the Neighbourhood gave him the best of Characters .

I was going home between One and Two in the Morning , in the Month of May , the 9th Day of the Month . - I live in a Habitation in Flying-Horse Court , - just by the Waxwork Shop , between Chancery Lane and St. Dunstun 's Church ; and I had not got up above two Thirds of the Passage , before I found my Hat go off my Head : I made a Back-blow with my Stick , but I miss 'd my Man , ( else he would have felt me ) and I turn 'd myself round at the same Time , and saw the Prisoner run over the Way ; I ran after him , and he got Ground of me , but he dropp 'd my Hat , and this honest Chairman stopp 'd him as he ran between the Poles of the Chairs . When I came up to him , he said , - I'faith I have name of your Hat No , says I , - but , I will carry you to the Place where you dropp 'd it . That 's the Man at the Bar , - for I never saw the Face of him till the Chairman took hold of his Wrist , and turn 'd him about ; then we carry 'd him to the Watch-house , and asked him where he lodged ? He told us in Rosemary-Lane . I asked him where he was going at that Time o'Night ? He said , - to see a Friend at St. James 's : I reply 'd , - He was likely to have more Halberds than Links to attend him . - All the whole Thing was done in three Minutes . Prisoner . I ask him , whether he had any Debate with any other Person , before he came out of the Alley ? Candy . I was not in the Court , - but in the Passage ; and I saw no one Soul living , till finding my Hat go off , I struck at him by Guess , and if I had hit him , he would not have been here , for I should have pay 'd him heartily , and so have dismis 'd him . Islmael Causter . I was standing at the Temple Exchange Coffeehouse with my Chair , and hearing Candy cry , - Stop Thief , and seeing the Prisoner run , I clapp 'd hold of his Wrist , and Candy said , - Let 's lead him back , for he has dropp 'd my Hat ; I carry 'd him five , six or seven Yards back , and found the Hat in the Kennel : Then I carry 'd the Prisoner and the Hat to the Watch-house , and deliver 'd the Hat to the Constable , or the Watchman , I do n't know which , I am sure the Prisoner is the Man I took ; for I had the Watchman 's Lanthorn , and my own , to see him by , - and I was with him at the Watch-house . Prisoner . Please to ask him , whether the Prosecutor was drunk or sober ? Couster . I ca n't say for that I was at Charing-Cross a little while before , and saw him ( Candy ) at the Fountain Tavern , and he was talking about having a Chair , and my Partner said , - Candy do n't want a Chair , and in about half an Hour afterwards he came homewards . He said no more that Night , than he said in the Morning , nor was he so disorder 'd , as to be incaple of knowing what he did . Prisoner . Did not the Deputy-Constable tell him he was a drunken , troublesome Fellow ? Causter . There was a Dispute in the Watch-house , and a great many People crowded about , so that I could not tell positively what the Constable said . Edward Lewis , Constable . The Prisoner was brought to the Watch-house , and Candy charg 'd him with taking his Hat . I was not there when he was first brought in , but Candy ( I found ) charged him with taking his Hat , so I sent him to Bridewell , and afterward carry 'd him before a Justice . This is the Hat ; I have had it ever since in my Custody . Candy had been drinking , but was not so fuddled as not to know a Man . He told me , he had been serving Copies of Writs ; he walk 'd as well as at other Times , but he is but a lame Walker at best . Jury . Who is your Deputy-Constable ? Lewis . We have no Deputy-Constable : One of our Watchmen is a Staff-man in the Parish ; his Name is Glover . Jury , to Candy . What is your Business ? Candy . I am a Porter at Temple-Bar , and have ply 'd there these fifty Years . Here 's a Gentleman in Court has known me a great many Years ; I have received some Thousands of Pounds at his House . The Gentleman . I have known him 25 Years : He is a Porter at Temple-Bar , and is employ 'd by Gentlemen belonging to the Temple : I never heard any Thing amiss of him , nor of his being a drunken Fellow ; with regard to that , I believe he is like other Porters . * Guilty , 10 d . * As this was laid for privately stealing from the Person , had the Jury found the Value to have been above 1 s. it had been a Capital Offence .

On the 12th of May , I ty 'd a grey Horse to a Post at the Bottom of Pudding-Lane , in Thames-street , while I went to Mr. Demiller 's , an Oyl-Shop at the Corner of St. Magnus Church , to ease myself . I was gone about eight or ten Minutes : When I came back my Horse was gone , and I was ill , and unable to run about to see for him . I thought the Carmen might have play 'd the Rogue with him , but a Woman told me , she saw a Boy get upon him and ride him away ; and I never saw the Horse again 'till I saw him in the Green-Yard , which was about six Hours after I lost him . The Green-Yard is a Pound , belonging to the City ; I am sure the Horse I found there , was the same I lost : I bought it of Mr. Thompson in White-Chappel . Michael Kitchen . I was going along Shoe-Lane with my Fish , and saw a Man lay hold of the Horse , ( the Prisoner being upon it ) and somebody said , he believed the Horse was stole . I said , I made no Doubt but it was stole ; for the Prisoner had been try 'd for stealing Horses : So I took the Prisoner and brought him through Newgate , towards the Compter . As I came along , a Man told me he knew who the Horse belonged to . I bid him fetch the Man , and he brought the Prosecutor , who own 'd it directly . When I took the Prisoner , he told me a Man gave him the Horse to carry to the Royal Exchange . Prisoner . I asked the Prosecutor to let me ride , and he gave me Leave , so I rode to TempleBar , an they took me , and put me in the Compter . John Nettlefold , Constable In Cheapside , at the Top of Wood street Kitchen gave me Charge of the Prisoner , on Suspicion of stealing the Horse : So I put the Prisoner in the Compter , and sent the Horse to the Green-Yard , to be pounded . About an Hour afterwards Mr. Row came and owned it . It was the same Horse that I took with the Boy on his Back . Ann Simons . I keep a Victualling House in the Minories . The Owner of the Horse ( William Row ) is an Acquaintance of mine , and I know his Horse . A young Lad , and an old mean-looking Man with him , brought the Horse to my Door , and having fastened him there , they came in , and called for six or eight Penn'orth of Veal . I having heard the Man ( Row ) say , he would never lend his Horse to the best Friend he had , - not even to his Wife , I asked them if Mr. Row was coming ? I told them I was sure it was his Horse , and asked them if the Farmer was dead , because I knew he had been ill of an Asthma . By God , says the Boy , I bought the Horse at a Country Fair . I have a great many People come to my House , and am tender of swearing positively to the Prisoner , but there was an old mean looking Man with him , about fifty Years old , and he said , - damn it , - it was his own , and he bought it at such a Fair , but they both seemed to be surprized , and paid me nine Pence Half-penny , and went away . I knew the Horse , and gave him a Crust of Bread at the Door , as the Farmer used to do . This was ( I think ) last Saturday was a Month . And about three Days ago the Farmer told me , he was to go to the Old Baily for Horse-stealing : I was surprized , and said , - What ! you to go there for Horse-stealing , if you are , I will bail you , as far as a hundred Pounds ; but at last I found he joked , and then I told him , I had seen his Horse with such Persons at the Door . Prisoner . I was going down the Lane , where This Man says the Horse was ty 'd to the Post , - I was going to my Father , who sells Brass Hooks at Coffee-Houses about the Exchange , and Billingsgate . , and this Man bid me ride his Horse a little Way , - not ride him too far : So I rode him to Temple Bar , and was coming back with him , the People stopped me , and Michael Kitchen charged the Constable with me , and said he knew me very well ; so I was carry 'd before my Lord-Mayor , and was sent here . I have Witnesses to call , - but they are not hereabout . Guilty , Death . 339 , 340.

I am a Book-keeper to the Peterborough Waggon , at the Horse-shoe Inn , in Goswell-street . The Box of Goods was brought to me , on the 28th of April , it was taken in by my Servant , and was directed to Mrs. Barbara Jakeman , at Peterborough . The Goods were lost out of the Yard , and I paid 50 l. for them . John Spencer . On the 28th of April , ( 't was Saturday Night ) between Nine and Ten , I took in the Box to go by the Peterborough Waggon on Monday Morning to Mrs. Barbara Jakeman , at Peterborough . Mr. Marriot 's Man brought it in , and a Carman brought up a Truss of Goods , and put it under the Shed , and the Box was set upon the Truss . The Prisoner Wint brought up the Carman 's Whip after him , and I thought he had belonged to him . In less than Half an Hour , the Box was taken away , but I ca n't say the Prisoner took it . Wint . Ask him whether he 's positive I am the Person that brought the Carman his Whip ? Spencer . Yes . Wint . Did you ever see me before ? Spencer No . Wint . Then how can you be positive ; you say it was between Nine and Ten o'Clock at Night ? Spencer . I had a Candle and Lanthorn , and saw more Men at the Door , but I can not swear the Prisoner Brown was one of them . Wint . Are you positive that I brought the Carman his Whip ? Spencer . I do n't care to swear it positively . James Akins . This John Brown , Jemmy Wint and I were in Moorfields , playing at Skittles , and from thence all went through Coleman street , and along the City , to see if any Chance offered . When we came to Aldersgate , we saw a Cart going through the Gate : Wint said , - here 's a Chance , and he jumped up , and pulled the Box towards the Tail of the Cart , but at Long-Line End , the Carman turned about and put it farther in the Cart again We followed the Cart to the Horse-shoe Inn ; then the Carman took the Box to carry up the Inn , and cry 'd , - who will hold my Whip ? Wint said , - I will . Then the Carman took a Truss and carry 'd it and the Box up the Yard , and Wint followed with the Whip . In a little Time he came down the Yard again , and said , - 't was hoddy enough ; - we shall have it presently . Then he went up the Yard again , and brought the Box as far as the Horse-Pond , but a Woman coming up the Yard he set it down , and when the Woman was gone , he went in again , and brought it clear off . Brown stood at the Watch-House at a little Distance from the Inn , and I sat upon a Bench , where I could see all he did ; we kept asunder , that the People might have no Occasion to suspect us , from seeing too many of us together . I have known Wint and Brown a great while , and here 's a Man they call the Handsome Drawer , that has often seen us together . Robert Staples , the Handsome Drawer . I am Servant at the Farthing Pye House , the Sign of the Maiden Head , a Publick House on Windmill Hill . I have seen them several Times together , but ca n't recollect the particular Days . I have often seen them together in Moorfields , and they have been several Times , since last Christmas at our House , and at other Ale-houses . I know nothing of their Characters , for I never conversed with them , nor do I know how they get their Bread . I have heard , that one of them is a Calender , and the other a Weaver . Wint . Have you ever heard any Harm of me ? Staples . Harm ! - I never saw any thing of Harm . - I have heard but an indifferent Character of them . - I can alledge nothing against them . - I have heard their Characters are but indifferent . Akins . When we had got the Box , we carry 'd it into the Fields , and there we broke it open , and took out the Goods . We carried them to my Room , and fetched Bullinbroke and Deal to buy them . We bargained for 7 l. 8 s. 6 d. She knows 't is true , and that this was not the first Time she has been at our House , and she knew how we came by our Goods . I went to her that very Night about Eleven o'Clock , and she told me , she could not come to look at the Things that Night , but she lent me a Shilling , and she was at that Time a-bed with Deal . On Sunday Morning she came to see the Goods ; we bargained , and she took the Silk away with her then , and gave us a Guinea in Part , out of a Green Purse . On Monday Morning they came and took more of them , and gave us another Guinea , and in the Afternoon they came and took all the rest away , and paid us the rest of the Money . Bullinbroke . Did I , or Jemmy Deal , buy the Goods ? Akins . She made a Bargain for the Silk , and was to give four Guineas for it . Deal and she fetched away the Gloves in a Hand-Basket . The Woman knows me very well , her Husband , William Bullinbroke was hanged * a very little while ago . And Wint was an Evidence against Grafton Kirk and Terry Gerrard+ . * He was convicted last December Sessions . See his Trial , No . 16 . + They were convicted December 1737 , for robbing Captain Gough , and Mr. Adams in the Endfield Coach . Wint . I have People to speak to my Character , ever since I was Guilty of that Fault . Jonas Meredith . I come to speak for the young Man , - I ca n't think of his Name , - but I know him ; my Brother marry 'd his Mother , - I ca n't think of his Name , - he never wronged any body in the World . John Anderson . I live in Brick-Lane ; am a Broker and a Weaver too . I come to speak for John Culverrwell , - Brown . That 's my right Name . Anderson . He is a Journey-man Weaver by Trade , and I have seen him at Work at his Father-in-Law 's , - Joseph Meredith , in Angel-Alley ; I believe I have seen him at Work , within these twelve Months . As to his general Character , I have heard but very little amiss of him . - He might be given to Drinking , or so , - I have not heard much against him . Mr. Chamberlen . On the 23d of May , Brown was bought before me , and made a voluntary Information of ten or twelve Robberies , and put Akins into his Information . I had heard of this Robbery , in Goswell-street , and asked him if he was concerned in that . He said , - upon his Word he was not . I bid him conceal nothing , and told him , if I found he did , I would have nothing to say to him . Akins had put this Robbery into his Information , and so I would not stop him . If Brown had confessed this , I should have admitted him an Evidence against Akins . Three Witnesses appeared for Brown . One always thought him to be honest and just : Another took him to be a sober Lad , but as to his Character he never enquired into that ; and the 3d never knew any Harm of him . A Woman appear 'd for Wint , and gave an Account that she had employ 'd him in carrying Fruit , Greens , & c. for her to Spittlefields Market ; that he did this Business for her about four Months , and then enter 'd himself on Board a Man of War ; that he came home about Christmas last , and since that Time had fetch 'd Scores of Pounds for her . Jury . Had Brown Part of the Money ? Akins . Yes . Out of the first Guinea we had 7 s. a-piece , and the Money was shar 'd in the Room where we liv 'd . The other Guinea was shar 'd in the Street , at Whitechappel , and the rest we shar 'd in the Afternoon . Brown had his Share of the whole . Wint , Guilty . Brown , * Acquitted .

Elizabeth Malton . On the 5th of April , about Eight o'Clock in the Evening , I came into the Shop , and found this Akins with a Piece of Ribbon in his Hand , ( 't was my Father 's Shop ) so I seiz 'd him with the Ribbon in his Hand , but he got from me , and I pursu 'd him quite cross the Street , and got him down upon the Ground ; his Hat fell off , and I took it up : This is the Hat . I do n't know the Prisoner , but I am positive the Evidence is the Man that was in the Shop . We lost the Things mentioned in the Indictment , among which were a Parcel of Linnen Handkerchiefs , - how many I ca n't exactly tell , but I am sure there were two Dozen , and we miss 'd them , and the other Things , the Minute the Evidence was got out of the Shop ; I am sure they were there when he came in . I am positive to the Evidence , for I spoke to him in the Shop , and as I pursu 'd him in the Street , a shorter Man than he took hold of my Gown-sleeve , to prevent my following him , and said , - Do n't follow him , Child , for you ca n't catch him , - he is run away . Prisoner . Was I the Man that laid hold of you ? Malton . No : 'T was much such another as Brown . James Akins . This John Brown and I , and the Prisoner , were going along Bishopsgate-street , and seeing no body in this Shop , Brown went in , and brought two Caps , - Prisoner . He 'll say any Thing , as he did in the former Trial . Akins . It was between Eight and Nine o'Clock at Night , but I ca n't say what Day it was , but 't was in April : We were going to see what we could steal , and seeing this Shop , and no body in it , at the Corner of Artillery-Lane , Brown went in , and got hold of a Piece of Ribbon , and this young Woman took hold of me as I was coming out , and asked me what I wanted . We had taken out the Goods they lost before she seiz 'd me ; there were five Velvet Caps and Hoods , and twenty six Linnen Handkerchiefs : Among the Velvet Things , there were two Mens Caps , and a Child 's , with a Button at the Top , and two Hoods , which makes five in all . After Brown had fetch 'd out two , I went in , and brought out three , - the Child 's Cap , and the two Hoods ; - Wint stood in the Middle of the Highway , and what we got , we deliver 'd to him : He knew we went into the Shop to steal the Goods . After we had got these Things , I went in again , and laid hold of a Piece of Ribbon , but this young Woman caught me ; I ran from her into the Street ; she follow 'd me , I fell down , and she fell upon me ; my Hat fell off in the Scuffle , and I got from her , ( without staying to take it up ) and ran away down Dunning's-Alley . Brown was at the Door , when I ran out of the Shop , and the Prisoner , ( who stood in the Highway ) ran away when he saw the Bustle , but when it was over , we met at Moll Bullinbroke 's , in Three-Tun Alley , the Corner of the Rope-walk , ( near Rosemary-Lane ) and we sold all we had got for a Guinea , and divided 7s . a-piece . Wint . Ask him , ( on his Oath ) whether I had not parted with him that Night , and had not bid him Good-Night ? And whether he did not run after me , and say , - Here 's a Chance : Whether I did not say , - Where ! And whether he did not tell me of this Shop , and when he brought the Caps to me , I did not say , - I would not be concern 'd ? The young Woman did cry out , Stop Thief ! but I was not concern 'd with them . Akins . 'T is no such Thing ; for we never parted from Twelve o'Clock at Noon , till after the Fact was committed . John Brown . ( who was try 'd with Wint in the preceding Trial ) Wint and Akins call 'd me out about Twelve at Noon , and we went into Moorfields , and play 'd at Cricket till 't was dark . Then we came through the Tenter-grounds , and through Sun-street , and bid Akins Good-Night , and he cross 'd the Way from us , and went into this Shop . When he had got some of the Things , he call 'd after us ; and then I went in and got some more : The Prisoner came back , and stood in the Middle of the Highway . I brought out two Mens Caps , and gave them to Akins ; - what he did with them I do n't know , - but I gave none to the Prisoner . Indeed Akins gave all he got to him , ( the Prisoner . ) I found he had , when we afterwards met together , for when we met , he had ( in his Possession ) all that was got by us . 'T was two Hours before we met together , - because there was a great Uproar in the Street about us . Q . On what Intent did you go out together ? Brown . We did not design to go out with him , ( Akins ) but only as these Things lay so , ( conveniently ) he call 'd us , and then we went with him to rob the Shop . The Prisoner and I were going away from him . Q . On your Oath , and as you must answer for the Breach of that Oath to God , did you all go out with an Intent to rob , - or not ? Brown . Not before this Akins call 'd us . The Witness was ask 'd again in a solemn Manner , ( and reminded of his Oath , and the tremenduous Consequences of calling God to help him in an Untruth ) whether they did not go out that Night with an Intent to steal ? Brown . - Yes , - and the Prisoner stood on the other Side the Kennel , over against the Shop , and took the Things from us . And we afterwards met at Bullinbroke 's Lodgings , by Rosemary-Lane and sold them to James Deal , who lives with her as her Husband , for a Guinea , and the Prisoner had 7 s. of the Money . There were but twenty-one Handkerchiefs . Wint . Brown says there were but twenty-one , and others swear there were twenty-six , - that 's five Handkerchiefs Difference . Akins . I ca n't tell whether they were all sold ; but I saw twenty-six upon the Bed in Bullinbroke 's Lodgings . Brown . There were but twenty-one , and they , with the rest of the Things , were sold for a Guinea , and the Prisoner had 7 s. of the Money . Wint . Did Akins quit the Handkerchiefs before they were sold ? Akins . We went down Stairs , and left them upon the Bed , and afterwards had the Money . Wint . But did not I come down Stairs with you ? Akins . I came down first ; the Prisoner follow 'd : We all came down , one after another . Wint . And I am afraid , you 'll soon follow me . Guilty , Death . 349.

I got up next Morning between Five and Six o'Clock , and I found my House very well , - all , but my Shop broke , and my Meat gone . The Shutter was broke , I found it broke before Day-light , - before Five o'Clock , when I get up . I found all my Things gone by Candle-light next Morning . - I never had a Bit of my Things at all , and I made no Complaint about them . Prisoner .

We broke the Shutter in half , and had it not been for his two Dogs , we should have gone into his Back-room .

William Elliot . I lodged in Lumley 's House in the Old Baily : The Prisoner was recommended to me by Lumley , as an honest Man , so I let him lie with me ; and on Friday , the 12th of January last , he stripp 'd me of all I had in the World , and did not leave me one Farthing to save my Life . I lost all the Goods and Money mention 'd in the Indictment as my Property , and I am sure the Prisoner is the Man who robb 'd me ; I do n't say I saw him take them away , but he was taken with them all upon him . I am sure I never took a Farthing from him but us 'd to give him Three-Halfpence every Morning . I wo n't tell a Lie for the whole Globe . I had all the Things in my Pocket , and was to have gone to Flanders on Monday Morning , if I had not been robb 'd I should have been gone gone before , if I had not waited for some Things a Man was making for me to carry with me . I never saw the Prisoner from the Time I was robb 'd till now . William Whiteer . ( or Whitehead ) I lodged in Shoe Lane , at a Woman 's House , who us 'd to sell a Dram . The Prisoner frequently came there for a Dram , and I have now and then drank a Dram with him . On the 12th of January , between Five and Six in the Morning , he knock 'd at the Door , and said he came to pay my Landlady 6 d. or 7 d. which he ow 'd her ; she let him in , and he asked for me ; she told him I was abed , and he bid her call me down to drink a Dram with him , and tell me he had some Shipmates at Brentford , who had appointed him to meet them there , in order to sell some India Goods : I would not go down , so he came up to my Bed-side , with half a Pint of Gin in his Hand , and my Bed-fellow and I drank two Glasses apiece , and he told me he was to meet some Shipmates at Eleven o'Clock , at Brentford , and if I would go with him he would give me a Crown : So I set out with him ; and in Piccadilly , as we pass 'd a Night-cellar , I said , a Draught of Beer will do us no Harm after our Drams ; so we went in and drank . While we were in the Night-cellar , he pull 'd out this Watch ; I asked him what 't was o'Clock ? He could not tell ; so I took it out of his Hand , and found it stood ; I wound it up , and set it a-going , then he took it , and put it in his Pocket . At Brentford he shew 'd it me again , and told me it cost him 15 l. I guess 'd it at 10 l. and imagin 'd it was only Pinchbeck 's Metal , but he took a Knife , and upon scraping the Edges of the Case , found it to be Silver . After we had eat a Rasher of Bacon , he told me he could not stay , for he was going to Bristol , and from thence to Ireland , and he desired me not to take any Notice where he was gone : So I left him , and came homewards , and being afterwards at the Bull and Garter , by the Ditch-side , I saw an Advertisement , which occasion 'd my telling the Landlord that I had been that very Day with the Prisoner at Brentford ; so we went to Lumley , and he and I hired Horses to pursue him . At Reading , Lumley could go no farther ; but I went on to Newbury and seized him , with all the Goods upon him : A Gold Ring set with Stones , a Gold Watch , the out-side of which was Silver , gilt ; a Gold Stone Ring ; the Gold Buttons , and the Gold Pendants , & c. All which I delivered to Lumley , who had advertised him . I did not search him for Money , but all the rest of the Things were found on him , except the Cloth Breeches . I then charged him with the Robbery , and he owned it , and said he took the Breeches out of the Chair , in Elliot 's Room . He had a Silk Camblet Coat , a Scarlet Lepelle Waistcoat , and two Pair of Breeches on ; one Pair was Silk Camblet , I do n't remember what the other was . The Prisoner own 'd he stole all these Things in George Lumley 's House , in the Old Baily , and they were delivered to Lumley . George Lumley . The Goods are all here but the Watch , and I borrowed Money upon that when I came from pursuing the Prisoner , for I had spent Money upon the Road , and Elliot told me , he would pay my Charges . I staid at Reading , and Mr. Whiteer brought the Prisoner to me , and he gave me the Gold Pendants and the Silver Watch-chain , because he owed me Money , 45 s. when he went away ; I asked him for Money , but he gave me no more than six or seven Shillings , I borrowed Money at the Elephant and Castle , in Fleet Lane , to go with Whiteer after the Prisoner , who had left all his Things at my House , and had taken Elliot 's . There were two Pair of the Breeches , and the Lepelle Waistcoat belong 'd to another Lodger , one John Goodwin , and that Waistcoat I have now at Home , for Goodwin is gone abroad , and would not take it with him . William Goodhall . Here are the small Things : Lumley brought them to me , and I lent him 10s . upon them . Here 's a Ring , and a Pair of Buttons , set in Gold , a Pair of Gold Pendants , and a Watch-chain . Lumley told me he pawned them by the Direction of the Prosecutor . Lumley . The Watch I pawned to a Gentleman in Charterhouse-Lane , - but I do n't know his Name . I had laid out 3 l. 9 s. on my Journey , and when I came Home , I had no Money for my Family , so I pawned the Things . Elliot . I never had a Word of Discourse with Lumley about pawning the Goods . When he came Home , he told me , he had taken Care of the Chap , ( the Prisoner ) and had taken fresh Horses at Reading , and so went to Newberry , where he seized the Prisoner , and brought him to Reading . Well , says I , what have you done with my Goods ? Your Goods , says he , are in the Justice of Peace 's Hands , at Reading . He had no Money when he went after the Prisoner ; and when he came Home , I observed he was very flush in Money , but he never said a Word of his having pawned my Goods , 'till six Weeks or two Months after he came back . Lumley . I mentioned it to him , about a Fortnight or three Weeks after I had pawned them . Prisoner . I gave Elliot six Ounces of Gold for these Goods . Elliot . I never had to the Value of a Pin , or a Pin 's Point , from him in my Life , as I am in the Presence of Almighty God . Lumley . Whiteer brought all the Things in his Pocket to me at Reading , except the Gold Buttons and Pendants ; they were in the Breeches the Prisoner had on , and he told Justice Pottinger he took them instead of his own , and found the Things in them . Whiteer said he would hang the Prisoner , - he would hang him for the Reward of 40 s. which I had promised for taking him . Whiteer . I did demand the 40 s. of Lumley , and he abused me in a scandalous Manner , and told me the Man should not be hanged on any Account , and he himself would appear a Witness against me . Roger Lewis . The Prisoner has been in my House about five Months ago , and behaved well . I have heard Whiteer say , he would do what he could to hang the Prisoner . He said it was his Due , and he would take Care he should be hang 'd , if possible . I ca n't say I heard any Thing mentioned about the Reward . The Court ordered Lumley to produce the Watch , and Restitution to be made of that and the other Goods to Elliot , and the Jury found the Prisoner Guilty of the Indictment . Death . 368.

The Council for the Prosecution having open 'd the Charge , and the Nature of the Offence , the Copy of the Record of Mr. Poplet 's Acquittal was produced , and read . Mr. William Keat . I was present at Poplet 's Trial , and remember Goodman 's being in Court . I saw him sworn in the usual Manner . The Indictment against Poplet , was for privately taking from him 13 s. 6 d. He swore , That as he was going on the 9th of February , in a Coach from Newgate to the Judges Chambers in Chancery Lane , the Person that sat against him in the Coach , stopped his Mouth , near the Market , and that Brogdon Poplet took from him 13 s. 6 d. by Force . There was a Question subsequent to this ; he was asked , - of what particular Pieces the 13 s. 6 d. consisted Goodman answered , - two Half Crown , eight Shillings , and a Six-pence . He was then asked , how lately he had seen that Money ? He answered , - about a Quarter of an Hour before . He was asked , in what Manner the Money was taken from him ? He made answer , - that Poplet put his Hands into his Breeches Pocket , and took the Money from him by Force . He said , he had been robbed and beat by Poplet . These are the Words which were sworn upon that Trial . Counc . You have given a long Evidence ; - did you put the Words down in Writing ? Mr. Keat . Not at that Instant . I did not take them down in Writing at that Time but after the Trial was over , we went to a Tavern ( The Baptist 's Head ) in the Neighbourhood , and staid there two or three Hours , and had some Refreshment . Counc . Then you took down the very Words you have repeated at the Tavern . Mr. Kents . I did ; and have the Paper now at home , among my other Papers ; I saw it within these three or four Days . Counc . How many Hours did the Trial last ? Mr. Kent . Not above half an Hour . Mr. Poplet said at the Tavern , he had been grievously injured and would indict him for Perjury : And the Pen and Ink was called for , in about a Quarter of an Hour after we went in , and I wrote down the Evidence , and reduced them into an Indictment the next Day . Counc . Did not Poplet move for a Copy of his Indictment when the Trial was over ? Mr. Keat . He was was going to speak something to that Effect , but was told , that Goodman was a Prisoner , and it would be of no Service to him . Counc . When the Order was obtained from the Attorney General that you should have a Copy , did any one attend on Goodman 's Behalf , to shew cause to the contrary . Mr. Keat . No , no body at all . Goodman has since owned to me , that he did swear he was going in a Coach from Newgate , to Chancery Lane , and lost 13 s. 6 d. in the Coach . Mr. Poplet offering to be sworn , the Councel for the Defendant objected to his giving Evidence , but the Objections were not allowed . Poplet . I am an Officer to the Sheriff of Middlesex . In February last , three Countrymen came to my House and enquired after Goodman , telling me they wanted to arrest him for five or six Horses , he had brought from Northamptonshire , and had not paid for them . I bid them get Processes according to Law , and I would endeavour to take him . Accordingly on the 5th of February I saw him go into a Tavern , and a Woman followed him ; I arrested him , and the Son was with him and another Man ; there was Edward Goodman , Thomas Goodman , and Phillip Spencer . I had five Warrants against him , and he had been sheltered in the Globe-Tavern , in Drury Lane , over-against my House for a Month , and when I endeavoured to take him , they opposed me with Sticks , and broke my Head ; but I over-powered him , and got him to my House . Then I asked him if he would go into another Officer 's House , for 24 Hours ? He said , G - d d - mn you , you Rogue , I will hang you . This is one of the Warrants I had against him , but that , by vertue of which I carry 'd him to Newgate , I have not about me . I told him he was a silly Man , and that I never had done any Thing to deserve Hanging in my Life , and asked him again , if he would go to another Officer 's House ? He said , he was protected by Baron Bothmar , and would go to Newgate , so I carry 'd him there ; and Mr. Hopkins afterward writing to me , to get the Return of a Habeas Corpus , in order to carry him to the Fleet , I bid Murphey get a Coach , and he and I took Goodman into the Coach , to carry him to the Judges Chambers . As we went along , he wanted to go to Fleet-Lane , and put his Head out of the Coach , and call 'd out , Bailiffs ! Bailiffs ! - take me away : There was only Brogdon Poplet , ( himself ) James Murphey and Goodman in the Coach . He was never insulted ; no one touch 'd his Mouth , nor a Farthing of his Money : He did receive a Blow on the Side of his Head , by a Jolt of the Coach , when he was straining to get out of the Coach-window ; he never complain 'd ; - when we came out of the Coach , there were the two Tip-staves , and we went to the Judges Chambers , and the Clerk indorsed the Habeas , yet he did not complain , as I heard . Counc . Here , - Poplet , - you swear he was never insulted , & c. on your Oath when he came to the Chambers , was not he very bloody ? Poplet . No Marks of Violence , - there was a Blow on the Side of his Head , by the Jolt of the Coach . If there was any Complaint made it was whisper 'd among themselves . James Murphey confirm 'd Poplet 's Evidence . Benjamin Boxall said , he saw Goodman and his Son knocking down Poplet at the Globe Tavern in Drury Lane , but Poplet being too strong for them , carry 'd him to his House , and ask 'd him if he would go to any other Officer 's House ? That Goodman call 'd him Names , and said he would hang him , and Goodman told him he would go to Newgate , for he had a Protection , and should then be near home , - the Hartshorn Inn , in Smithfield , where ( he said ) he lodged . Lawrence Sherwood swore , he had heard Goodman complain of having been evilly treated by Poplet , but at that Time he did not say he had been robb 'd . That about two Days afterwards he saw him again , where he had seen him before , ( at Mr. Jones 's in Fleet-Lane ) and then he complain 'd that Poplet had indicted him in the Crown , but he did not say any Thing of the Robbery , nor did he hear him say any Thing about it , till the Night before the Bill was found against Poplet . The Witness said , he had heard it whisper 'd by others , that Goodman had told Jones he had been robb 'd ; upon which he asked Goodman what he had lost , and he told him , - there were two others in the Coach with him ; and they stopp 'd a Handkerchief in his Mouth , and took from him two Half crowns , and 3 s. and 6 d. and this the Witness said , he penn 'd down , - in his Mind , and advis 'd him to indict Poplet by his Name , for robbing him with two other Persons unknown . John Chapman gave an Account that Goodman complain 'd to him , that Poplet and two others with him robb 'd him in the Coach of three Guineas . Goodman 's Council after having open 'd the Evidence in his Defence call 'd . Mr. John Phillips ; ( Tipstaff ) depos 'd , that he was call 'd out of the Coffee-house to carry Goodman to the Judges Chambers , but Goodman would not come out of the Coach , for ( he said ) they were going to rob and murder him : That he was bloody , and complain 'd in the Chambers that he was choak 'd with Blood , and wanted something to drink , but he did not hear him say any thing about Money . Francis Harling was sent for , to come to Goodman the next Day : He found he had been much abused ; his Head broke , and his Stomach black and blue . Goodman then told him , he had been abused by Bailiffs , and had been robb 'd of 13 s. and 6 d. Mr. Hopkins depos 'd he came to Jones 's to take Bond for Goodman , and he complain 'd he had been robb 'd of 13 s. and 6 d. by Poplet , and appear 'd to have been very ill used . Mr. Gumley depos 'd , that he saw Goodman that Night , and he complained he had been robb 'd of 13 s. 6 d. by Poplet and two others , and had been abused by them in the Coach . This Witness , and Mr. Yewen , John Jones , and William Selwood , gave the Prisoner a good Character . Mr. Lane saw him the Night he was committed to the Fleet , and deposed , That he complained of having been very much beaten by Poplet , and that he had been robbed by him of 13 s. 6 d. This Witness said , the Man was really in a very bad Condition . Acquitted . 378 , 379. Samuel Bird , and Susannah Clark , were indicted for assaulting Mary Edwards ; Bird , for feloniously , violently , and against her Will , ravishing and carnally knowing the said Edwards , and Clark for being present , aiding , comforting , & c. him the said Bird , the said Felony to commit , & c . Mary Edwards depos 'd , she was 14 Years old , and lived at the Bell Ale-house , in George-Alley , near Fleet-ditch . That on a Thursday or Friday , ( three or four Days before the Prisoners were taken up ) a Woman , whose Name was Nanny , bid her carry a Pot of Beer to Clark 's Room , up one Pair of Stairs , over against the Ale house in which she liv 'd . That as she went up Stairs with the Beer , Bird met her upon the Stairs , took the Drink from her , and pull 'd her into the Room . That he set the Beer down on a Table , and threw her down on the Bed , Clark and Nanny being both in the Room at the same Time . That Clark shut the Door , and then sat down by the Fire , while Bird kiss 'd her , & c. ( the Witness express 'd herself in Terms necessary to prove a Charge of this Nature ) She said , Clark swore at her for crying out ; and Nanny went down Stairs , and told another Woman what had been done , and this Woman told her Grandfather . This Usage happen 'd to her , ( she said ) between Three and Four o'Clock , and Clark open 'd the Door after the Witness had been in the Room about a Quarter of an Hour , and she went home directly , but nothing was mention 'd of the Affair , till Sunday Noon . That her Grandfather then scolded at Clark , and talk 'd to the Witness about it , but she did not tell him a Word of what had happen 'd till Night . That on Monday Night Bird and Clark came to their House to ragg ( scold ) her Grandfather for what he had talk 'd of , concerning them ; and there being a Talk about sending for a Constable , Bird said he would stay till an Officer came , and after he had sat a good while , he complain 'd that he could not stay all Night for the Constable ; but her Grandfather perswaded him to be easy , and he would get one , which at last he did , and the Constable took Charge of the Prisoners . She added , that the Prisoner was a Shoemaker by Trade , but pretended to be skilful in Surgery , and came to Clark 's House to cure her of the foul Disease . And at the Time she was ill used , there were several Lodgers in the House , but none on the same Floor . John Bradford confirm 'd some Part of the Girl 's Evidence . Sir John Stonehouse ( Surgeon ) was called . The Surgeon . I am the same Gentleman belonging to Sir George Stonehouse , Bart . by his Title , I am so , being all the Sons he had . I know nothing of the Prisoners directly nor indirectly ; but Mr. Bradford belonging to the Child , he sent for me three or four Days after the Thing was done , to search the Girl , to inspect or look into - She was a little tumified , - tumify 'd comes from the Word tumeo , and tumor , tumoris , to puff up and swell . There was some small Damage , but not a great deal . I gave her some Things accordingly , for Fear , ( as I understood the Man was a vile Fellow ) there should be some Foulness . Alice Mace gave an Account that she was in Clark 's Room all the while , and that Nanny was not there at all . That the Girl brought the Beer into the Room herself , and set it down on the Table ; that she then sat herself down on the Bed , and Bird sat down by her . The Witness mention 'd some Acts of Immodesty in the Prisoner , but nothing that amounted to a Proof of the Charge , and said , the Girl talked very impudently , and told the Prisoner he should not lie with her . She added , that there was not the least Noise , and that the Girl went away very well , and free from Passion . - Close deposed , That he lodged in the same House , and but a few Steps above the Prisoner 's Room ; that he was at home at that Time , and heard no Noise , though if any had been made , he must have heard it . Elizabeth Wolford deposed , That the Girl 's Grandmother told her there were no Signs of ill Usage upon the Girl 's Linnen . A Witness gave Bird the Character of an inoffensive Man . Another gave the Girl the Character of being very pert , and said , he had taken Notice of her being very fond of the Doctor 's ( the Prisoner 's ) Company ; but he never saw them together .
