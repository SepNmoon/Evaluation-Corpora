The Councel for the King having opened the Indictment , and the Nature of the Offence , ( which was made Felony without Benefit of the Clergy , by the IXth of his Present Majesty ) and having taken Notice of the evil , Consequences of this Practice , and the Nature of the Evidence to support the Indictment , John Hough was swornn . Hough . I am an English Man , born in Warwickshire ; by Trade I am a Taylor , but I have been a Grenadier in the first Troop of Horse-Guards these four Years . Counc . Was any Application made to you to quit the King 's Service , for any other ? Hough . I did not think proper to leave my King and Country , to serve the King of Prussia , but I have had great Encouragement to do it . Connc . From whom , and when ? Hough . About the Beginning of last August , or the latter End of the other Month , ( it was last August ) one Carrol came to my House , and asked me to take a Walk with him ; I refused him at first , because my Wife was ill a-bed : He came again in the Afternoon of the same Day , and likewise the next Day ; I then went with him , and he carry 'd me to a publick House at the Back of the Royal Exchange , I believe 't was to the Sign of the Horseshoe . After we had drank together , he told me he would fetch a Gentleman who would speak with me , and accordingly he went out , and in a few Minutes he brought in one Anderson , who shook Hands with me , drank my Health , and ask 'd me if I had any Desire to go Abroad ? I told him , no . Then he asked me it I had dined ? I told him I had not : Upon which he sent Carrol for some Beef Stakes , and in the eating them he told me , I was a likely young Man , and would do very well for the King of Prussia , and that his Service was much better than the King of England 's . After we had din 'd plentifully , he drank a Health to a particular Person on the other Side the Water , and we parted for that Time ; but Anderson and I met several Times after this , and he having promis 'd me some Work for him , as a Taylor I went to his House in Crown Court , in Crown Alley , Upper Moorfields , and spoke to him about it : He told me , he would send me some Cloth to make up for him ; but , says he , I know a Gentleman that wants to speak with you , and if you 'll go to the Royal Exchange , and sit down on the Bench , I will meet you a Quarter after Twelve . I went thither , and waited a good while ; at last the Prisoner came up to me , and asked me if I was not waiting for one Anderson , I told him yes ; he then took me to the Cross Keys Tavern , where I found Anderson , and we had a Fowl and Bacon dress 'd for Dinner , and drank several Bottles together . After we had drank plentifully , the Prisoner told me , Carrol had used me ill , in not delivering me the Cloth which Anderson desired I might make up for him , but I do assure you , ( says he ) you shall have whatever Anderson has promis 'd you ; and pulling a Sheet of Paper out of his Pocket , he gave it into my Hand , saying , - here is my Master 's broad Seal , and this is his own Hand writing : His Master ( he said ) was the King of Prussia , and that was his Power to enlist all Men who were willing to go , and none else . At the Bottom of the Paper he shew 'd me the White Horse , which is Part of the King of England 's Arms . What the Contents of the Paper were I can not tell , for I could not read it : I am but a poor Scholar , and can not read English , unless it be wrote very plain . Counc . What Day was it when he produced that Paper ? Hough . It was in the Beginning of August , but I can not tell the Day exactly . The next Day we met at Guild-hall Coffeehouse , and agreed to meet again in the Evening at the Crown , in Princes street , near the Royal Exchange : There we drank Beer , and had Oysters for Supper , and the Prisoner paid the Reckoning ; he was too honourable to let me pay any Thing ; I never paid but one Two-pence in his Company , and that was at this Place , when our Reck nig once came to 20 d. and he paid 18 d. and I laid down 2 d. At this Time he appointed me to meet him the next Morning , and he then told me , he had got a young Gentleman ( whose Father had a Place under the King ) to go Abroad with me , and who was taller than me by an Inch or two , and the Gentleman would be glad of my Company , and we might pass for Brothers . The Day following this , we met at Guildhall Coffeehouse again , and he talk 'd about the young Man that was to go with me ; I have since found it was one Charles Clay , who had lately been discharged out of Newgate , that was to pass for my Brother , and to go with me to Prussia . This Man the Prisoner brought with him the next Day to Guildhall Coffeehouse , and there he told me he would make Anderson 's Promise good , and would make up 10 l. for me here , and 10 l. more he would give me when I came on the other Side of the Water . Counc . What was you to have this Money for ? Hough . The Prisoner was to give me this Money to go over to be one of his Majesty 's Gentlemen , as they are stil 'd , - to be one of the King 's Body Guard : The King 's Gentlemen is the usual Appellation given to his Body Guards ; - we call them here the King 's Gentlemen , and to be sure 't is so Abroad . Our next Meeting was at the Crown Tavern at Cripplegate , and he would have had us have brought our Wives with us ; but I refus 'd , and said , no , no , we 'll have no Wives with us . When the Prisoner order 'd me to meet him at the Crown at Cripplegate , he wrote me this Paper of Directions . - I saw him write it with his own Hand . Counc . You say he agreed to give you 10 l. here , and 10 l. on the other Side the Water , - what was you to do for it it ? Hough . I was to serve the King of Prussia , as one of his Body Guard . I asked him how I should be sure of the Money when I got Abroad , and he swore , by the Eternal God , I should have it . He likewise told me , he would give me some Cloth to make up against I went Abroad , and he desired me not to be dilatory , for he did not know how soon the Captain would go off . According to his Order , I met him and Clay about Noon at the Crown at Cripplegate , and we had not been there long , before the Prisoner 's Wife and Child came to us . We all ded together , upon a Shoulder of Lamb roasted and a Scrag of Mutton boil 'd ; and after Dinner , the Prisoner said - I do n't know , Mr. Hough , how soon we may go ; if I should give you some Cloth , I do n't know whether you 'll have Time to make it up , therefore here is a Thirty-six Shilling Piece to buy you a handsome Coat . Your Cloaths ( says he ) will be but of little Signification to you there , for my Master allows a Summer and a Winter Suit . At the same Time he changed a Guinea , and gave Clay half a Guinea , as a Person who was to serve the King of Prussia , as well as I ; and Clay and I drank to one another , shook Hands , and agreed to pass for Brothers . Before we parted , he order 'd me to come every Night to him at the Crown in Princes-street . and I accordingly went thither the next Evening . He then asked me if I had got Cloaths to go in ? Perhaps ( says he ) you have not Money enough ; so he left a double Louis d'Or with the Man of the House , and borrow 'd 14 s. upon it , which he gave to me . He then took Measure of my Head , telling me he would buy me a Hat , and some ruffled Shirts , and would put me on board as a Merchant . Counc . On what Account did he give you these 14 s. at this Time ? Hough . This was the Day after I had the Thirty-six Shilling Piece ; and he gave me the 14 s. to buy other Things ( as I thought proper ) in order to my going over with him . I had made an Information of all this , sometime before , to Colonel Deveil , but there was no Warrant granted , because he said he would acquaint the Lord Harrington with the Affair ; but in the mean Time I discover 'd it to my Officers , and they inform 'd my Lord Albemarle , and then I had a Warrant to take them up ; but upon enquiring after the Prisoner , we found he was gone on board to provide for our Passage ; Carrol and Anderson were fled before , and the Constable and I went several Times to the Prisoner 's House , and we were told he was gone Abroad likewise . Counc . Had you any more Money of the Prisoner , than the 36 s. and the 14 s. which you have mentioned ? Hough . Yes ; I had several small Parcels before , which he gave me for my Keeping till I went with him to the Ship . Counc . What Excuse did you make to him for not going ? Hough . He press 'd me to make haste , because the Captain was going ; but my Intent was not to go , tho ' I promis 'd him I would : I told him , I would get my Things ready as soon as possible . And after I had a Warrant to take these People up , I went immediately about it ; but they were all fled . Carrol , I hear , is in Ireland , and Anderson is with the Prisoner 's Brother at Dunkirk . The Prisoner was taken at the Dolphin Inn without Bishopsgate ; he was to have gone Abroad next Day . Counc . How far was August run out before the Prisoner was taken ? Hough . We were never three Days asunder in the whole Time . The last Money I receiv 'd of him was on the 22d of August . Counc . How long was that before he was taken up ? Hough . He had left his Lodging four Nights , and was taken nine or ten Days after at the Dolphin Inn . Counc . Look on these Papers . - Are you sure the Prisoner wrote them ? Hough . Here 's three Directions : These two I saw him write with his own Hand . The Papers were read. `` 12 . At the Crown Tavern , Cripplegate. `` At the Bare , ( Bear ) Castle-street , against the `` Meuse. `` 12 . At the Crown Tavern , Cripplegate . '' Hough . The second Direction to the Crown , the Prisoner wrote , because the first was not wrote plain enough for me . Counc . Are you sure what Day in August you met the Prisoner at the Crown at Cripplegate ? Hough . I am sure it was the 21st or 22d . The last time I met him was on the 22d of August , and that was at the Crown in Princes street . Counc . When was the first time you met at the Crown at Cripplegate ? Hough . The first time was in the Beginning of August ; but when he gave me the 36 s. it was about the 20th or 21st , and I am sure it was a Thirty-six Shilling Piece , for I put it off for so much ; and I received it from him , for going to Prussia to serve in that King 's Body Guards . He said he did not know how soon the Ship would sail , and I said , - I did not care how soon I went . Prisoner . What Day of the Week was the 14 s. given you ? Hough . I ca n't tell what Day of the Week it was ; but 'is my Opinion it was on the 22d of August ; for the Begining and End of the Affair was in that Month . He had been out of the Country , and was come to England but five Days before he apply 'd to me . He had been to carry a Man Abroad , and shew 'd me a Letter intimateing the same , at the Time he shew 'd me the Commission , - the large Sheet of Paper : And I know the Man he carry 'd Abroad was offer 'd to our Company . Prisoner . You say I paid you other small Sums at different Times , what were they for ? Hough . He gave me 3 s. 6 d. and such small Sums , for my Keeping , and those little Sums were to be made up 10 l. here , and I was to have 10 l. more on the other Side the Water ; he told me so , when he gave me the second little Parcel of Money . He gave me 4 s. 6 d. at Guildhall Coffeehouse , and bid me speak if I wanted any thing , for whatever I wanted I should have , while I was here . Prisoner . Did I mention one Word to you of serving in the King of Prussia 's Army , or in the Body Guards ? Hough . He did , as God is my Judge , twenty times over . Prisoner . At what Place was you first told , that you was to serve in the King of Prussia 's Army ? Hough . At the Cross Keys , by the Exchange ; where he shew 'd me the Commission : and that was in the Beginning of August . Prisoner . Was your Name enter 'd in any List or Roll ? Hough . I believe you know that is what can not be done . The Roll , I suppose , is kept on the other Side the Water . Prisoner . Have not you apply 'd to me for Work as a Taylor ? Hough . The Prisoner promis 'd to employ me several Times during our Meetings , but he never was as good as his Word . Prisoner . And was not you angry with me for not employing you ? Hough . No . For if he did not give me Work , he gave me Money ; and that was as well . Prisoner . I have been ill and fatigu 'd , so ca n't express myself as I would . 'T is a base Prosecution , and I believe will turn out so . William Court . I keep a victualling House ; the George , in Monmouth-street . I have known Hough about three Years : His general Character is that of a Rogue . I never heard any Man give him a good Character , but have heard many give him a bad one . He lodged twenty-three Weeks in my House , in the Year 1736 , but he never paid me any thing . He was a Soldier , and bid me kiss his Arse . I had him before his Colonel and the Colonel endeavoured to get my Money , but Hough told him plainly he would not pay me . He has been once in my House since that time , and drank a Pint of Beer , but I believe he did not sit down . Counc . Who do you know , that are of his Acquaintance ? Court . I ca n't tell . He is known about Monmouth-street ; The Neighbours who use my House , know him . Counc . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Court . No ; I never saw him in my Life . Patrick Grogan . I live in Princes-street , by Drury-Lane , and have known Hough very well by Sight , for these two Years and upwards He has a very bad Character given him , by every one he deals with . I took the lower Part of his House to sell Beer in . I believe he values his Oath no more , than I would [ do to ] take the Snuff of this Candle and throw it on the Floor . Counc . And how long did you live in his House ? Grogan . About a Quarter of a Year : I did not observe any ill of him during my Continuance in his House , but the People in the House gave him a bad Character . Once I saw him buying stolen Goods in my Apartment . He bargained for a Waistcoat , and was to give fourteen Shillings for it ; then he took the Man to the Barley-Mow , and afterward I saw him bring the Waistcoat home . I did not know at that time , that it had been stole ; but afterward the Man at the Cross Keys in Monmouth-street , came to ask me if I had bought such a Thing ? I told him no , - but I knew who did . Counc . Pray where do you live ? Grogan . I keep the King's-Head , in King's-Head Court , Drury-Lane . I am a Taylor by Trade , and before I kept this House I lived in Ireland ; from thence I came to London ; and from London , I went to Paris , to edify myself in my Business and from Paris I came to London . Counc . So you went from London to Paris to edify yourself as a Taylor , Alamode de Paris , and from thence you came to London to draw Beer . Nathaniel Hawkins . I live in Exeter-street , and have known Hough about sixteen Months . His general Character is that of a Rogue . Every one that knows him gives him that Character . I lived nine Months in his House , out of the sixteen . I knew he bought the Waistcoat , but I did not make any Information of it . Counc . How long was this before you quitted his House ? Hawkins . About four Months . I gave him Warning the next Quarter Day . Counc . I suppose you paid him his Rent ? Hawkins . No : I did not . He distrained upon my Goods , a Fortnight after Quarter-Day . Counc . Was you present when Hough bought the Waistcoat ? Hawkins , I heard him say he had bought a good Bargain for 13 s. and that he would not take a Guinea and a Half for it . I do n't say he knew it was stolen . Counc . What Business do you follow ? Hawkins . I am a Stay-Maker , and work with Mr. Alsop , in Blackmoor-street . Elizabeth Langford , I have known Hough about three Quarters of a Year and a Month . His general Character is that he 's a vile odious Man , and do n't care what he does for the Lucre of Money , nor whose Life he takes , - nor what he does . He lives next the George Inn , in little Drury-Lane . Counc . You answered to the Name of Langford . Is not the last Witness ( Hawkins ) your Husband ? Was not your Evidence set aside on a Trial at the Marshalsea , because you was his Wife ? Langford . I only live with him , to look after his little Apartment , and to wash him , and mend him , and to take Care of his Children , for he has no Wife . Charles Martin . I have known Hough about a Year and a half . I live now within three or four Doors of him . The Neighbourhood gives him the Character of doing any thing for the Lucre of Gain . I am not acquainted with him any farther than giving him a civil Answer in passing and repassing . I lived once three Months in his House , and I believe he would not scruple to swear a Man 's Life away . I believe he would do it for nothing , - provided he could get any thing by it . James Gorman . I have known Hough between four and five Years . I do n't hear any thing of a good Character of him . His Neighbours give him but a very indifferent one , as that he is a very uneasy , unjust Neighbour . I do n't think he is to be believed upon his Oath . I am a Journeyman Taylor , and I live in Drury-Lane . I worked with him at one Mr. Carrington 's , at the Golden-Key , in Wych-street , two Summers , off and on . Francis Priest . I have known the Prisoner about four Years : He always bore an honest Character , and I believe he is in a good Way of Business . He buys Cloth , and goes abroad to France , and Dunkirk . I know he bought four or five Pieces at a Sale , and I bought four Yards and a half of him again . I believe he trades sometimes to Holland , and brings Goods from abroad , but I do n't know that he ever entered any at the Custom-House . Abraham Anderson . I have known the Prisoner three Years . I never heard any thing to contradict his being an honest Man . He trades to Dunkirk , and I have sold Cambricks for him . I reckon him a Merchant , but I ca n't say I know of his entering Goods at the Custom-House . Edward Hartrey . I have known the Prisoner seven or eight Years . He trades beyond Sea : I never bought any Goods of him , but I bought some Houses of him about eight Years ago , and have paid him a deal of Money . I never heard but that he had a good Character , nor ever knew that he was concerned in inlisting Soldiers . Richard Oldridge . I have known the Prisoner five Years ; he is in a good Way of Livelyhood , and has a good Character . I never heard of his enlisting Men for Soldiers , in my Life . He goes about half a Dozen times a Year to Holland and Dunkirk , and I know the Captain who was to have carry 'd him , this time , - if he had not been taken into Custody . I have made him 14 Great Coats for Exportation , and two or three of my Servants pack 'd them up , with some other Goods , among which was a Piece of coarse Cloth , about eight or nine Shillings a Yard , and some Remnants of six Shillings a Yard . Prisoner . What Sums and Bills have you seen in my Possession ? Oldridge . To the Value of 600 l. in Money and Bills . Jury . What Colour were the Cloaths you made up for the Prisoner ? Oldridge . Some of them were dark Drabs ; some of them were lin 'd , and four of them unlin 'd . John Lee . I have known the Prisoner sixteen or seventeen Years . I never heard but that he had a fair Character . I have dealt with him for some Pounds , and always found him as honest Man . I could not believe this Charge against him was true , when I heard it . The Council for the Prosecution called the following Witnesses , to support the Character of Hough . Mr. Timms . I know Hough ; his general Character is , that he is an honest-Man . I am a Taylor , and live very near him in White-hart Yard ; I am a Housekeeper there , and have known him nine Years . His Character is good , as far as I know ; I never heard any Ill of him , and believe he would not forswear himself . Prisoner . Have you had any Dealings with him ? Timms . No : But I believe him to be an honest Man , though I have not dealt with him . Samuel Bird . I live about twenty Yards from Hough 's House , and have known him about two Years . What he deals for , he pays for . I never heard , or knew , of any Dishonesty in him . I am a Housekeeper in White-hart Yard ; Hough is a Soldier , and his Wife keeps a Chandler 's Shop . I do n't believe he would swear a Man 's Life away wrongfully . Nathaniel Hopson . I have known Hough about five or six Years . I am a Housekeeper , at the Artichoke in White hart Yard , - 't is joining to Drury-lane . I never heard but that he had an honest Character ; nor do I think he would forswear himself . Joseph Crisp . I live in Russel-street , Covent-Garden - but a little Distance from Hough 's . I have known him three Years , and he bears the Character of a very honest Man . I have entrusted him with some Scores of Pounds ; he has return 'd Money for me , because I did not think myself so proper to do it ; and I have always found him honest , and he has faithfully accounted with me , for a Hundred or two of Pounds . He is entrusted by me at this present time . I never heard any Man give him an ill Character , or speak an ill Word of him in my Life . As for perjuring himself , I do not think he would be guilty of such a Fault . Prisoner . What Business do you follow ? Crisp . I am a Housekeeper ; I keep a Chandler 's Shop , and have lived about Half a Year where I do now . Prisoner . You say you are a Chandler , and you talk about his returning 200 l. for you . From where did this Sum come ? Crisp . From Norfolk . I am not Scholar capable of taking Care of my own Affairs ; so I entrusted him . Prisoner . Why Hough can not read a Letter . [ The Prisoner produced a written Paper , which was Shewn Hough . ] Hough . I ca n't read this Paper ; but what signifies that ? I can keep an Account , and I can write a little . Mr . Crisp had 200 l. left him in the Country ; I went down , and manag 'd the Affair for him , and kept a just Account . I have paid Six-score Pounds , and have Fourscore more to receive for him . Robert Rounsome . I have known Hough twelve or fourteen Months . I live in White-hart Yard , near where lives ; I never heard a bad Character of him , before I heard it here ; in the Neigbourhood where he lives he bears a good Character . Captain Hopkins . I have known Hough ever since the 23d of February 1735-6 . I enter 'd him then in the Troop , and the Man has behav 'd well . I never heard he had a bad Character , and I believe he would not forswear himself . Prisoner . Has he never been punish 'd ? Captain Hopkins . No ; never . He came and told me of this Affair , on the 24th of August ; but he had been with Mr. Deveil before . When he acquainted me with it , I informed the Major and we went to my Lord Albemarle about it . The Warrant to take the Prisoner was granted a Fortnight after Hough had made his Information before Mr. Deveil ; but he was not taken till a Week after that time . I know nothing of the Prisoner . Serjeant Lock . Hough had been in our Troop about four Years ; he always behav 'd like a Soldier , and has done his Duty . As to his private Affairs , I know nothing of them . I never heard any Ill of him . Thomas Plant . I keep a Publick House in White hart Yard ; the Sign of the Antelope . I have known Hough a Year and a Half ? he has a very good Character . I never heard any one speak ill of him till I came here ; nor do I think the Man would be guilty of an ill thing . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . 491.

James Bennet and Elizabeth Bennet , otherwise Elizabeth Cornforth , were indicted for stealing three Linnen Shirts , val . 16 s. and a Man 's Hat , val . 2 s. the Goods of James Mawle , Esq ; Sept. 10 . John Cool . My Master , Mr. Mawle , had a Lodging in the Prisoner 's House in Bond-street , and when I took my Master 's Things from their House , I miss 'd three Shirts : This was about the 12th of last Month . My Master came to this Apartment about the 24th of last June , and the Shirts were in a Portmanteau-Trunk in his Room , which was lock 'd , and I kept the Key in my Pocket . I saw the Shirts in the Trunk , and took Notice that it was lock 'd , about two Days before I miss 'd them ; but then I found the Lock burst open , the Shirts were gone , and likewise a Hat out of a Box in the Closet . Two of the Shirts were found at two different Pawnbrokers , and the Prisoner wore the Hat when he went into Confinement . - Fletcher . I believe the Prisoner at the Bar to be the Man from whom I took a Shirt in Pawn , on the 10th of September , at Night . Cool . I miss 'd the Shirts on the 12th . Prisoners to Cool . What Rent did your Master owe ? Cool . I know nothing of any Rent owing to them ; but I know they ow 'd my Master Money . There had been an Action against him , ( Bennet ) and upon that Account he ow 'd my Master 20 l. Prisoner . Ask Cool how he got into our House , when he took his Master 's Things away . Cool . My Master was out of Town , but I had a Key to the Door . Fletcher . I can only say , that I believe the Prisoner Bennet was the Man who brought me this Shirt , in the Name of Cornforth . Cool . This is my Master 's Shirt . Martha Walker . I was Mrs. Bennet 's Servant ; she gave me a Shirt to pawn , and I carry 'd it to this Woman , ( Barbara Withers ) and she lent me 4 s. upon it . I forgot the Day of the Month . Barbara Withers . On the 8th of September , in the Morning , I lent 4 s. upon this Shirt , in the Name of Martha Walker . Cool . This is my Master 's . I am sure I saw them a Week before . Mrs. Bennet . His Master ow 'd me Money for Rent , and I having some Suspicion that he was moving his Goods , I thought proper to secure the rest , and not being used to make Seizures , I did not do it in a proper Manner . People told me , I must lock them up , and give his Master a proper Account of them . After this Mr. Maule sent for my Husband , ( on a Sunday ) to the Three Tun Tavern , in order to settle the Account of what was due to us , and he desired his Things might be delivered to his Servant ; but it being insisted upon that I should be paid before the Delivery of the Goods , he got a Warrant against my Husband for an Assault , and carry 'd him before Sir Edward Hill . Mr. Bennet . After this I was arrested , and while my Wife was getting Bail , and I under Arrest , Cool got into the House , and took several Things , and the Key of the Portmanteau , which was in a Card Table-Drawer . The Shirts were not in the Portmanteau , but in a little Chest of Drawers . Mrs. Bennet . When I went out to get Bail for my Husband , this Martha Walker went with with me , and in her Haste she shut the Street-Door , and left the Key in the Inside . Martha Walker . 'T is true ; and when I came home , I saw Cool coming out of the House , with the Cloaths upon his Arm , and a Band-box , so I got a Constable , and took him before Sir Edward Hill to give an Account of himself . I do n't know whether the Things were his own or his Master 's , nor do I know how he got in , for I left the Key in the inside of the Door . Mr. Brumfield . Mr. Bennet came to Mr. Deveil with an Information against Cool for a Burglary . When he was taken , he confess 'd he got in at the Window , and took away his Master 's Things , upon which he was sent to the Gate-house ; and after several Examinations , Mr. Deveil found it was a Dispute between Landlord and Tenant , and it appearing to him a malicious Prosecution , Cool was discharged . He ( Cool ) never mention 'd any thing of a Felony having been committed by the Prisoners , at that time ; but afterwards one Hayman charged them before Mr. Deveil with a Shirt , val . 2 s 6 d. and insisted on their being sent to Newgate . All the time that Cool was in Custody , he never mention 'd this Robbery , but he own 'd he got in at the Window for his Master 's Goods ; and they swore , that some Goods of theirs were taken out of another Room , Both Acquitted .

On Sunday Morning , the 16th of September , about One o'Clock , I open 'd a Sash that looks over a Parlour , ( which is lower than the rest of the House , and was cover 'd with Lead ) to see whether it rain 'd or not : The Leads at that Time were very wet , but upon putting my Hand out of the Window , I found it did not rain . Mr. Paris . This House is mine ; and the Parlour that has been mentioned , was cover 'd with near 40 C. wt . of Lead . On Saturday Night , between Ten and Eleven o'Clock , as I was going to Bed , I look 'd out of a Window that looks over these Leads , toward Somerset Gardens , to see what Weather it was , ( according to my usual Custom ) and I then saw the Lead safe ; but at Six o'Clock on Sunday Morning , Sept. 16. as I came down Stairs , I saw two great Strips cut off to the Joinings where the Lead is doubled over . Upon this I went down Strand-Lane , and enquired of several People if they had seen any Lead carrying off ? One of them told me , that William Green of Maypole-Alley had a good Job To-night , and that a great deal of Stuff had gone into his House . Hearing this , I went to Maypole-Alley , and enquired after Green ; before I could get a Word of an Answer , the People said , - What , Sir , have you been robb 'd To-night ? I had a wretched Character of him , and therefore I apply 'd to a Magistrate for a Search Warrant , but could not get one on Sunday . However , I planted my own Servants , and five or six others , about the House : In short , I beset it all Sunday and Sunday Night , and went myself every Half Hour , or Three-quarters , to see that my Watch did Duty . About One o'Clock on Monday Morning , my Servant sent me Word , he had seiz 'd a Man with some Lead ; I went to him , and found Hesketh with a large Quantity , which I thought was mine ; so I carry 'd him before a Justice , and upon his Information I search 'd Leeson 's House , and in a little private Hole under the Stair-Case , I found another Quantity press 'd as flat as possible . I examin 'd it , and found some of it still wet ; I took as much of it as I thought was mine , and sent it to be flatted , and upon laying it to the Place , I found it tallied exactly in all the Notches and Indentures . I am very positive all the Lead I found in Leeson 's House was mine ; but when I had it laid on the Place from whence it was taken , there was not enough , there was still some wanting : So I went to search Green 's House ; there I saw some small old Iron , but a huge large Pair of Scales , and at last I found my Lead , and pick 'd it out of a great Quantity which he had in his House , and upon laying it to the Places where it had wanting , it tallied in the most exact Manner ; in one Place they were forced to cut round a Nail , and the Cut in the Lead fitted the Nail . Upon this I took Green , and carry 'd him before a Justice , where he own 'd that he himself carry 'd Part of my Lead to Leeson 's House , ( which is exactly opposite to his own in Maypole-Alley ) at Three o'Clock on Sunday Morning . The Lead that my Man stopp 'd upon Hesketh , that likewise was mine , and I left it in the Constable 's Hands ; that was cut very irregularly , and tally 'd exactly . I lost above 8 C. Wt . I think there was 9 , but I wo n't swear to a Pound or two . Edward Oak . I do n't know the Prisoners ; but on Sunday Evening , I saw two Men carry something like Lead under the Flaps of their Coats to Hesketh 's , at the Corner of Maypole Alley . One of the Men had a Set-to Coat on , with a Cape ; he was very much like the Prisoner , and the Coat like what Green has on now : I saw them carry it into Hesketh 's Cellar . I saw no more of them that Evening , but on Monday Morning , between Six and Seven o'Clock , Hesketh brought something in a Basket out of his Cellar ; and to me , it appeared , as two Bunches of Turneps . He called a Man to give him a Lift-up with the Basket ; which I saw , and was surprized that two Bunches of Turneps should be so heavy ; so I followed him from his Cellar to Clare-Market , and there he pitched the Basket upon a Bulk . Then I went up to him , and asked him if those Turneps were to be sold ? No , says he , there 's nothing to be sold . I insisted on looking into the Basket , and found a Parcel of mill 'd Lead under the Turneps ; so I sent for my Master , and we took Hesketh before Mr. Justice Frazier , who granted us Search-Warrants , by virtue of which , we found great Quantities in Leeson 's and Green 's House , all which , ( with that , which we took from Hesketh , ) fitted exactly to the Places , from whence they were taken . When Green was before the Justice , he said , he had been out that Saturday Night till Twelve o'Clock , that he then came home in Liquor and went to Bed , but his Wife called him up about Three o'Clock , and told him , some Lead was brought to the House , which his Cousin took in , and he was uneasy about it , and said , it must be removed . He told us , that his Wife informed him , the Lead was brought in by Thomas Asser , and that he himself carried Part of it to Leeson 's House , telling him , he was not afraid himself , nor need he ( Leeson ) fear coming into any Trouble about it . Thomas Hesketh . I was the Porter , and the Lead found was in my Basket . On the 16th of September , at Night , the Prisoner Leeson called to me , and asked me where Green was ? I asked him if any thing was the Matter , more than ordinary ? He said , yes ; he had a great deal of Lead in his ( Leeson 's ) House , which was brought in that Morning . Leeson wanted to move it to my Cellar , but I advised him to stay till Green came ; but he swore a great Oath , and said he would throw it down the Vault . After this I went to get a Pint of Beer , and while I was gone , I found two Pieces had been brought into my Cellar . I saw Green presently after ; he told me he was not afraid of any thing , and bid me carry the Lead from my Cellar to Waldron , the Plummer , in Holborn . Accordingly , the next Morning , between 7 and 8 I put the Lead in a Basket , and covered it with a Bunch of Turneps , because I was afraid 't was not honestly come by , and I was stopped with it in Clare-Market , as I was carrying it to Waldron . This is one of the Peices that was then taken from me : I put my Name upon it , and here it is now . Mr. Paris . This is a Piece of what I lost . Mr. Frazier . Green being brought before me , owned that such Lead as Mr. Paris had lost was in his House , but he could not give any Account how he came by it : He said it came in , while he was from home . Leeson was not brought before me . Mr. Paris . Green told Mr. Frazier , that Thomas Asser , ( his Cousin ) brought it into his ( Green 's ) House , I asked him who this Asser was , and told him I would send a Horse and Man fifty Miles to find him , but he said he did not know where to find him , tho ' ( he owned ) he was his Nephew , and and lived in the House with him . Mr. Frazier . I do remember he mentioned Asser 's Name . Prisoner Leeson . Green knocked me up on Sunday Morning , and told me he had a Parcel of Lead in his House , which his Kinsman had taken in , and as he had been in Trouble before , ( on such Accounts ) he desired me to let him put it in my House , 'till the People who brought it should come for the Money , and then he should know ( he said ) who it came from . Mary Meddall . I am a Midwife . I live in Russel-Court , by Covent-Garden . On that Saturday Night I was sent for to Green 's Wife ; she was ill , and I thought it would be her Labour , so I staid with her till between Four and Five o'Clock on Sunday Morning . Pretty near Twelve , Green came home very much in Liquor , and his Wife and I went up , and saw him safe upon a Bed up two Pair of Stairs in his Cloaths . This was about 12 o'Clock ; - I am sure it was not past One . After his Spouse and I had seen him safe , we came down Stairs and had a Dish of Tea . About Two o'Clock , somebody knocked very hard at the Door , and Mrs. Green called to a Relation to see who it was . She went down two or three Steps herself , and I ( being a little curious ) listned myself ; and I heard three or four People say , - where 's Green ? We have got some Lead to dispose of . Mrs. Green told them he was a-bed , fuddled ; and that 't was a wrong time o'Night to bring Lead to sell . Why then ( says the Men ) we 'll leave it till we can speak to your Husband ; and I heard a heavy Load fall on the Ground . I have known Green six or seven Years ; he buys and sells old and new Brass , and Lead and Iron : I never heard any thing in this Respect before . He has the Character of a sober Man in his Neighbourhood . Indeed I have heard he has been in Trouble before , but he was Acquitted by the Court . Anthony Young , ( Green 's Landlord ) Charles Day , ( a Chandler ) John Harris , ( a Picture Frame-maker , and Keeper of a Stuff Shop ) gave the Prisoner Green a good Character . Thomas Deacon , in Stanhope street , the Corner of Maypole-alley , and Richard Harris , had known Green about nine Years , and gave Green the Character of a bad Man , and said he was a reputed Buyer of stolen Goods . John Lamb , William Foster , William Henning , John Logan , John Baily , Susan Foster , Richard Smallwood , Elizabeth Matthews , and Francis Rimer , gave Leeson a good Character . John Matthews swore he knew Leeson when his Mother was with Child of him , and that he always had behaved well . Green Guilty ; Leeson Acquitted . 496.

That the Prisoner was Steed 's Servant , and used to make the Prosecutrix 's Bed ; who missing her Goods out of the Room , after the Prisoner had been there an unusual time , she was tax 'd with taking them , and confess 'd the Fact ; acknowledging , that at the Instigation of one Paul King , she had thrown all the Things to him out of the Windows in the Prosecutrix 's Room .

I . * See Kew 's Evidence in the Trial of Robert Andrews , for picking Mr. Tanner 's Pocket , in Aldermanbury , of 55 Guineas , last December Sessions , p.9 . Mary Lillo . On the 1st of October I was comeing past the Mansion-house which is now building for the Lord Mayors ; and a Plank being laid over a very dirty Place , the Prisoner offer 'd to help me ; while he kept close to me , I felt something at my Pocket , under my Petticoat , and as soon as I had got over the Plank , I put my Hand in my Pocket , and found it cut . I know I had 12 s. in it when I was at the End of Lombard-street , for I then took out my Snuff Box , and felt my Money ; and I was no sooner off the Plank , but I miss 'd two Half-Crowns and 2 s. Upon this I turn 'd , and saw the Prisoner stand at the Place where he first offer 'd to help me , so I went back , and took him by the Sleeve , and charg 'd him with picking my Pocket , and three Gentlemen came up to my Assistance ; so we took him to the Mansion Alehouse , and charged a Constable with him . He was desired to send for somebody to his Character , but he refus 'd . Then the Gentlemen asked him , if he had any Money about him ? At first he said , he did not know what Money he had ; afterward he said he had 16 or 17 s. and at last he pull 'd out 17 s. there were two Half-Crowns , and all the rest were Shillings . Joseph Walton . As I was passing by Stocks-Market , Mrs. Lillo stopp 'd the Prisoner , and told him , he had pick 'd her Pocket . We carry 'd him to the Mansion-Alehouse , and she told the same Story that she has done now . We ask 'd him who he was , and where he lived ? He would not give us any direct Answers ; but at last he said he liv 'd in Whitechappel . I asked him in what Street ? He could not tell . Then a Gentleman asked him , what Money he had about him ? He said , he could not tell ; but at last he pull 'd out 12 s. and two Half-Crowns . We told him he might justly be suspected , and desired him to send for some People of Credit , to speak to his Character : The Drawer told him , there was a Porter ready to go to any one ; no ( he said ) he was innocent , and he 'd send for nobody . Upon this we advis 'd her to charge a Constable with him , which she did , and we carry 'd him to my Lord Mayor 's , where several People knew him ; but my Lord being at Grocer 's Hall , he was sent to the Compter for that Night , and was committed to Newgate next Day . Black Sam . When I was carry 'd up Stairs at the Alehouse , I pull 'd out my Things , and no Knife was found about me . Mr. Walton . The Prisoner was not search 'd at all : He pull 'd out his Money himself , and nothing but his Money . Black Sam . I would ask her , whether she met nobody between Lombard-street End , and the Place where she lost her Money ? Mrs. Lillo . I did not stop , nor meet any one , ( to be near him ) till I came to the Prisoner . Acquitted . 506.

On the 9th of September , at Night , as I was coming past Poor Jewry-Lane , by Aldgate , the Prisoner met me , and asked me how I did ; I told her I did very well , and stood talking to her about three or four Minutes ; in the mean time I found her Hand in my Pocket , and by that means it came into my Head that she had pick 'd it . I had about 25 or 26 s. in my Right-hand Breeches Pocket , and upon feeling for my Money , I miss 'd four Half-Crowns and a Shilling . I tax 'd her with taking it ; she deny 'd it ; - but I found a Half-Crown and a Shilling upon her myself , and the Napkin and Handkerchief were taken from her at the Watch-house . I never saw the Prisoner before the Night she robb 'd me ; but upon her asking me how I did , I stood and talk 'd with her , but what Discourse happen 'd between us I really ca n't tell , - for I have forgot it . When I first charg 'd her with robbing me , she told me I had robb 'd her ; but upon searching her at the Watch-house , the other three Half-Crowns were found in her Pocket , and as they were stripping her , the Handkerchief and the Napkin dropp 'd from her . George Wardley , Constable . About One o'Clock that Morning I had been with a Prisoner to the Compter ; when I came back I found the Prosecutor and the Prisoner at the Watch-house . He charg 'd her with picking his Pocket , and told me he had lost 11 s. but he had taken Half a Crown and a Shilling from her , and the other three Half-Crowns , he was sure , she had still somewhere about her . I ( knowing her to be a Woman of the Town ) expostulated with her , and desired her , - if she had done so , - to give him his Money again , - and I reprimanded her , and told her , our Watchmen must search her . Accordingly I carry 'd her into my Kitchen , adjoining to the Watch-house , and a Woman coming in , we search 'd her . I pull 'd her Gown open , and search 'd her Pocket , in which I found this Handkerchief , ( which the Prosecutor own 'd ) and in the Bosom of her Shift I found these three Half-Crowns . The Napkin dropp 'd from her on the Ground . Prisoner . I lodge with Samuel and Elizabeth Batman : He is a Watchman in Fenchurch street . On Saturday Night , about five Weeks ago , my Landlady sent me with 3 s. and 6 d. to her Husband at the Watch-house , that he might buy some Meat for Sunday 's Dinner . As I was going along , I kick 'd against something like Linnen , which I took up and put in my Pocket . At the Pump by Aldgate I met this Man : My dear ( says he ) where are you going ? Why , I do n't know you , says I , and I am in haste ; but he gave me a Pull , and asked me to drink , telling me he intended no Harm ; so I went with him into Crouched Fryars , and stood talking with him in the Street : He wanted to be rude , and told me , - perhaps I might want Money ; I said I was not given that Way , but he put three Half-Crowns down my Bosom ; and afterward , - when he found I would not agree with him , he put his Hand into my Pocket , and took out a Half-Crown and a new King George 's Shilling , which I was carrying to my Landlord .

When the Prisoners were carry 'd before Mr. Justice Farmer , they neither deny 'd nor confess 'd the Fact . James Steward . On the 26th of September , as I was going thro ' Mill Yard into Rag-Fair , about Ten o'Clock in the Morning , I met the Prisoners . Wharton asked me to go with him and Deacon to Mr. Carrington 's House at Hoxton : I went with them , and we watch 'd till the Maid went out ; then Wharton lifted me over the Pales before the Door , and I dug up the Threshold of the Door with a Butcher 's Knife , and made a Hole under the Door , thro ' which I endeavour 'd to get into the House ; but I stuck in the Hole , and could hardly get out again . When Wharton found I could not pass thro ' the Hole , he wrench 'd the Door off the Hinges with the Threshold which we had dug up ; then we went in , and took a Silver Porringer , seven Silver Tea-Spoons , and a great Spoon out of the Kitchen ; a Hat out of the Hall ; a Wig , a Shirt and a Handkerchief , out of a Room above Stairs , and a Bottle of Brandy out of the Maid 's Room .

On the 26th of last Month , as I was going along Rag Fair , a Woman call 'd to me , and told me , that Cuddy Wharton , and two other Lads , had brought her these Things to buy , and that they were to come again presently to know if she thought proper to have them . In Half an Hour , Deacon and the Evidence came to see after the Goods they had left with the Woman , and I seiz 'd them . Steward confess 'd he had committed this Robbery with Cuddy Wharton and Deacon , and by his Directions I went to Mr. Carrington , with what Goods he had taken , and he own 'd them . I found the Threshold of the Door dug up , and every Thing in the Condition Steward had mention 'd . When I came back from Mr. Carrington , he ( Steward ) gave me some broken Spoons out of his Pocket , and told me Deacon had more in his Pocket : Accordingly we search 'd Deacon , and I saw these Tea-Spoons taken out of his Pocket . Mr. Carrington . These are mine . Nathaniel Harris . These are what I took from Deacon : There 's a Spoon , and Part of another . He own 'd the Fact , and beg 'd I would do him what Service I could . Wharton . When the Thief takers took me , they asked me to make myself an Evidence , but I told them I was innocent , and told them where I work 'd ; so they bid me go home about my Business ; but next Day , about Eleven o'Clock , Harris came and took me from my Work . Harris . Steward did not make himself an Evidence till the next Day ; so we did not know till then that Wharton was concern 'd in the Fact . I do n't remember my asking Wharton to make himself an Evidence : He did tell me he work 'd upon the Keys before he was secured , and the next Morning Sullivan took him there . Deacon . 'T is pity this Man ( Wharton ) should suffer wrongfully : I never saw him till these Men brought him to me . Steward got into the House , and toss 'd the Things out to me . Wharton Acquitted ; Deacon Guilty , 4 s. 10 d. 528. Mary Tedman was indicted for stealing fourteen Ells of Holland , val . 30 s. the Goods of Thomas Clapham , in his Shop , Octo . 12 . Guilty , 4 s. 10 d. 529. John Morgan was indicted for a Misdemeanour , for that he , on the 2d of September , in and upon John Pay , [ one of the Officers of his Majesty 's Customs , on board a Ship called the Voluntier , then within the Limits of the Port of London , and in the Execution of his Office ] did make an Assault , and him , in the Execution of of his Office aforesaid , did forcibly obstruct , & c. against the Form of the Statute , & c. And likewise , for that he , on the 2d of September , the said John Pay did beat , wound and evil intreat , & c. And farther , for that he , on the 2d of September , on John Pay , did make an Assault , and him did evil intreat , and do to him other great Damage , & c. John Howard . I and Mr. Pay were station 'd on board the Voluntier ; we came up to Ratcliffe Cross on the 1st of September , and the Ship lay facing that Place between Twelve and One in the Morning , September the 2d . At that time it was my Turn to watch ; and hearing a Noise between Decks , I went down with my Candle and Lanthorn , and found the Prisoner and the Boastwain with two twelve-Gallon Casks of Rum ; I told them I must take Care of them ; but while I was arguing with the Boatswain , the Prisoner got one of them up upon Deck : I told him that he belong 'd to a Man of War , and was only employ 'd to work the Vessel up the River , and therefore that he had no Business with the Liquor ; and I call 'd to Mr. Pay , and to Mr. Blake , ( an Excise-Officer ) to help me ; and we carry 'd the Casks into the Steerage . Then I went down , and found two more Casks in the Bulk-head ; but before I could remove them over the Cable-Teer , I heard Blake cry out , Murder ! Upon this I ran up , and found the Candles and Lanthorns beat out , and the Prisoner immediately knock 'd me down : The two first Casks which we had stopp 'd , we had carry 'd into the Steerage ; and they were left under the Care of Pay and Blake : but while I was gone down to search farther , they fell upon the Officers , beat them , and got the two Casks over the Side of the Ship . When I found the Candles beat out , I attempted to strike a Light , and then they struck me a Blow in the Face , and beat away my Tinder-box , and got two more Casks from us , damning us , and telling us , - they would have them , or they would have our Bloods . When the prisoner was taken , he told us where the Liquor was , and we found it , according to his Direction , at the Lamb and Star at Newcranes . Counc . When you came up , on the Cry of Murder , did you see the Prisoner do any thing to Mr. Pay ? Howard . No ; I was knock 'd down as soon as I got up . I am a Custom-house Officer ; this is my Deputation , and I was on Duty on board this Ship . John Pay . Between Twelve and One , that Night , I came out of my Cabin to make Water ; and was going in again ; but my Partner hearing a Rumbling , he took a Candle out of the Steerage , and call 'd me to see after this Liquor . I roll 'd out one of the Casks ; and as I was going for the other , I saw a Man carry away one of them . Counc . While the two Casks of Rum were under the Custody of you and Mr. Blake , did the Prisoner do any thing to you ? Pay . When I told them they must not take the Rum , somebody knock 'd down our Lanthorn , and I was immediately knock 'd down too . The Prisoner was present ; but whether it was he , or not , I can not tell . Mr. Blake . I was there at the same time . The Prisoner took a Cask from me , but I ca n't say I saw him do any thing to Mr. Pay . Acquitted . He was a Second Time indicted ( as above ) for assaulting and forcibly obstructing , beating , & c. John Howard a Customhouse Officer , in the Execution of his Office , on board the said Ship , Sept. 7 .

James Wood was indicted for stealing two Silver Tankards , val . 17 l. and four Silver Spoons , val . 40 s. the Goods of Edward Edwards , in his Dwelling house , Octob . 2 . Guilty 39 s. 536. John Drinkwater , of St. Sepulchre 's was indicted , for that Catherine Kaylock , otherwise Harrison , on the 10th of December , in the 12th Year of his Majesty , in the Parish of St. Bride 's , a Repeating Watch , with the Outside and Inside Cases , made of Gold , val . 20 l. the Goods of the Right Honourable Sackville Earl of Thanet , Privately from the Person of William Lorton , did steal , & c. and afterwards , on the 18th of December , in the said Parish , he , the said Drinkwater , on account of helping Nathaniel Delander to the said Watch , feloniously did receive and have from the said Delander the Sum of 8 l. 8 s. as a Reward for helping him to the said Watch ; the said Catherine Kaylock , the Felon , not being apprehended , nor did the said Drinkwater apprehend , or cause the said Catherine to be apprehended and brought to Trial , nor did he give Evidence against her ; contrary to the Statute , & c. The Council for the Prosecution set forth , That the Offence charg 'd upon the Prisoner was Felony by the Act 4 Geo . c. 7 . 1 . 4. `` To prevent Persons `` acquainted with Thieves from following the `` pernicious Practice of procuring stolen Goods `` from the principal Felons , and making them `` over to the right Owners for a Sum of Money , `` without discovering the Felon '' ; and offer 'd to prove it in the following Manner , viz . That the noble Lord above-mentioned having sent a fine Gold Repeating Watch to Mr. Delander to be mended , Delander delivered it into the Custody of a Workman of his one Lorton . As Lorton was going home with the Watch , he fell into the Company of Catherine Kaylock , and she pick 'd his Pocket of it . The Defendant hearing of Mr. Delander 's Loss , and that one Pope and Kaylock , ( the Husband of Catherine Kaylock ) were in the Computer on this account , he apply 'd to one Lydia Goodwin , ( who is acquainted with many of this Sort of People ) and told her if she would go to the Computer with him , and be instrumental in getting the Watch , it might be a good many Pieces both to her and him . Accordingly , she went , and the Defendant got the Watch into his Possession ; but he being pretty well aware of the Penalty of the Act , it made him cautions in what Manner to restore it to Mr. Delander ; for he did not do it openly , and with his own Hands , but it was to be left at a Tavern , in a Room , under an old Almanack . The Money was first to be put there , and when the Money was taken from thence , the Watch was to be left . And that the Prisoner actually had the Watch in his Custody , they offer 'd to prove in this manner , viz . That he came home one Night in a very great Passion with his Wife , and cry 'd , D - n , you , why do n't you turn out ? But she not being dispos 'd to go out that Night , he was angry , and said , - then these two innocent People in the Compter shall not suffer ; fetch me the Watch down Stairs , - I will give it to Mr. Delander again ; upon this she went up and brought it down ; and deliver 'd it into the Prisoner 's Hands , soon after which it was restor 'd to Mr. Delander . But before the Witnesses were sworn , the Defendant 's Council beg 'd a Point of Law might be spoke to , by Way of Objection to the Prosecution of this Indictment : And the Council for the Prosecution having admitted , that Catherine Kaylock ( the principal Offender ) was dead , and had not been convicted ; the Defendant 's Council urg 'd , that the Act directs the Pains , Penalties and Judgment [ that is , the same Pains , & c. ] shall be inflicted on , and given against the Person that receives Money for restoring stolen Goods , & c. as should have been given against the principal Offender for stealing them , and that he shall be guilty in the same Manner , and shall suffer as for the same Crime the principal Offender had been guilty of : That the Crime charged in the Indictment was for privately picking a Pocket , which is a capital Offence ; but upon the Trial of the Principal ( Kaylock ) it might have came out only a single Felony ; the Evidence might not have been sufficient to have convicted her of picking the Pocket , but yet it might have been sufficient to have caused the Jury to have convicted her of a single Felony : And if , upon Conviction of the Principal , it had come out a single Felony , then the Defendant must not have been indicted for a capital Felony , & c. therefore it was impossible to know what Punishment to inflict on the Defendant , unless the Principal had been convicted . That the Act expressly requires the same Judgement in this Case , as should be given against the first Offender ; but as the first Offender had not been convicted non constat , whether the Crime was single Felony , petty Larceny , or Capital . It was farther observ 'd for the Defendant , That this Case tallied with that of Principal and Accessary : That receiving stolen Goods was not a Felony at Common Law , it was only a Misdemeanor , but it was made Felony by a particular Act , and yet it was never known that an Accessary was convicted of Felony , till the Principal had been convicted , and when the Principal could not be found , the Accessary could not be indicted for a Felony , but only for a Misdemeanor , & c. The Substance of the Reply to these Objections was , That if they were to prevail , the Act would be eluded , and the Subject frustrated of all the Benefit intended by it : That if the Principal had been taken , and a Bill found against her , and she had dy 'd , or broke Goal before Trial , it would be hard that the Act should be eluded , when the Fact mentioned in it could be prov 'd by sufficient Witnesses ; and as to the Comparison of this Case to that of Principal and Accessary , it is laid down in Hale 's , that tho ' the Principal does not appear , the Accessary may be put to Answer in a Way of Defence ; and Serjeant Hawkins says , that tho ' by ancient Authorities , the Party is not to be compell 'd to answer before the Principal has answer 'd , yet the contrary Opinion ( he says ) he takes to be settled at this Time . It was farther urg 'd , that the present Case was a different Case , and the Fact charg 'd on the Prisoner was an independant Fact : That the Gentlemen had mistaken the Words of the Act , which were , That the Party ( supposing him Guilty ) shall suffer according to the Nature of the Felony committed ( which was to be prov 'd by the Circumstances of the Case ) : That the Act does not say he shall suffer as a Principal ; but , if he is guilty , he shall suffer Pains and Penalties , according to the Nature of the Felony committed , and it does not mention a Word of the Principal 's being first convicted . It was likewise observ 'd , That in the Case of Jonathan Wild , the Principal Felon was not convicted when Wild suffer 'd : And if the whole of the Charge against the Prisoner was but a Pretence , yet he was under the Cognisance of the Act , ( for the Words of every Act must be suppos 'd significant ) and this Act says , If any Person , under Pretence of restoring , & c. shall receive Money , & c. he shall suffer , & c. and if it was a meet Pretence , he must answer , tho ' he must be convicted before he can suffer . It was farther observ 'd by the Counsel for the Prosecution , That they were ready to prove , that Part of the Indictment that affected Catherine Kaylock , and tho ' it was not to be prov 'd by Record , but by Witnesses viva voce ; yet , if that was prov 'd , it was hop 'd they should be allowed to proceed to the Proof of the other Part which affected the Prisoner ; and if both Parts of the Indictment were prov 'd , then the Court would be under no Difficulty to know what Judgment the Prisoner ought to receive ; because the Act says he ought to receive the same Judgment as if he had pick 'd Lorton 's Pocket himself . It was again urged , that this Construction would be an absolute Repeal of the Act , and directly contrary to the Meaning of it , & c. To which it was answered , That it was now impossible to convict a dead Body ; That there was many a Case that might be called casus omissus ; That the Party might die , and a Man might be disabled from doing what he intended to have done for his Country ; That the other Side knew the Principal , and if they had taken her , and the Defendant had refused to give Evidence , then they would have come with a good Grace before the Court ; That the Act relating to Principal and Accessary plainly chalks out the Method of Proceeding in such Cases ; which is , that the Court should give such Judgment against him , as against the Principal Felon , and it was impossible in the present Case to know what that Judgment must be , because it would have been in the Breast of the Jury to have found it either a Transportable , or a Capital Felony ; That it was incumbent upon them to shew what kind of Judgment was to be awarded against the Principal , but as the Act of God had put it out of their Power , it was now impossible . That the Observation that had been made of a Man 's taking Money under a meer Pretence of restoring stolen Goods , being within the Act , is not sufficient , because the Act lays it down , that the Goods must be stole , though it be not expressed therein totidem verbis , yet it says , such Offender shall be punished as if he had stole such Goods , and in such a Manner , and with such Circumstances , as if the Offender had stole them ; and the particular Kind of Stealing must be proved , and the Manner of it , before Judgment can be given in such a Case as this . That as to the Citations from Hale and Hawkins , though they say the Accessary may be put to answer , yet his Tryal was never proceeded on , till the Principal was try 'd : And an Instance was mentioned , where a notorious Receiver of stolen Goods was taken , and nothing could be done against her till they had got the Principal ; who being taken , was try 'd , and burned in the Hand immediately , that he might then be a Witness against the Accessary . That as to Jonathan Wild 's Case , the Exceptions were not then made . And as to the Objections being a Repeal of the Stature , it was otherwise , for the Man that helps another to stolen Goods for Money may be laid hold of , and then for his own Security he will discover the Principal , & c. & c. Upon the whole no Evidence was given . Acquitted . The sentence passed on the Prisoners will be found in the following TABLE .
