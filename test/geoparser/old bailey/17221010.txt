The Jury found him Guilty to the value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] Abel Wild , of St. James Westminster , was indicted for privately stealing from James Barber , a Handkerchief , value 3 s. on the 17th of September last . Jame Barber deposed , that the last Execution day at night , standing in Princes Street Leicester Fields , to hear 4 Boys play on the Violin , he felt the prisoners hand in his Pocket pulling out his Handkerchief ; which taking hold of himself , he pull 'd at one end , and the prisoner ( keeping his hold ) pulled at the other , till at last the prisoner twitch 'd it through his Hand , and threw it behind him . He secur 'd the prisoner , but could not find the Handkerchief again . Guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] William Harvey , of Mary Bone , was indicted for feloniously stealing 3 Masons Chissels , value 3 s. the Goods of Stephen Nevison , and 4 Chissels value 2 s. the Goods of Alexander Rockhead . Stephen Nevison deposed , That being at work at the Lord Bingley 's they left their Tools there at Night , and in the Morning 27 were lost , and sometime after he found 3 of them at a Smiths , who us 'd to batter his tools , and who knowing his Mark , stop 'd the Prisoner when he offer 'd them to Sale ; they were mark 'd with a particular private Mark , which had belong 'd to his Family in Scotland for many Generations , and which Method of marking was very much esteem 'd in that Country . The Prisoner being a Smith , had partly wrought the Tools over again , but the Marks being pretty deep were not quite hammer 'd out . Rockhead depos 'd to the same Effect . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that he was a Smith , and bought the Tools at an old Iron Shop among other Stuff , and ( as is common when they find any thing useful ) hammer'd'em over again to make them appear better for Sale . He brought several Smiths to prove that it was usual to buy such things among Old Iron , and work them over again for sale , and that they had seen him buy Tools among other things at the Old Iron Shop . The Jury acquitted him . Thomas Glanister , of St. Giles in the Fields . was indicted for feloniously receiving a Silver Tankard , value 6 l. a Silver Mugg 3 l. a Salver 5 l. 54 l. of Bolonia Thrown Silk value 70 l. and other things , the Goods of John Folwell , on the 28th of July last , knowing them to be stolen , and for stealing of which , Mary Darbieau was Convicted of Felony at the Sessions held here on the 4th of April last . Christopher Leonard depos 'd , That himself , Richard Trantum ( not yet taken ) and Mary D'arbieau broke open the House of Mr. Folwell in the Night , and took from thence the Goods mention 'd in the indictment ; which they sold the Prisoner in Holborn ( his Son Nathaniel being then present and assisting , of which he was convicted at the Sessions in May last ) . The Prisoner was at first scrupulous of dealing with this Evidence , because he was a new Face , and ( as he told Trantum ) did not yet look like a thorow faced Rogue , and therefore would not be concern 'd with him till he was satisfied of his being a Villian , fit to be trusted . They then agreed to meet at the Ducking-Pond , by the Spaw at Islington , in order to give the Prisoner a satisfactory Account of the Qualifications of this Evidence : which Trantum did ; by telling him that he was lately return 'd from Transportation . Nay ( says the Prisoner ) if that 's the Case , I am Safe , and all is well . Then they brought the Goods to the Prisoner 's House , and he gave them 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce for the Plate , by his own Weights , which were none of the heaviest , and 12 l. 10 s. for the Silk , which was worth 70 l. and threw them a Guinea over in the whole . The Plate was mark 'd , and this Evidence ask 'd him if he could dispose of it : O ! says he , I could safely dispose of the King 's Crown if I had it . The Prisoner in his Defence said , That he never saw Leonard before , and called several of his Neighbours to his Reputation . Alexander Brown , at the Yorkshire Grey , by the Watchhouse in Holborn , depos 'd , That the Prisoner was a Taylor by Trade , and us 'd to deal in Cloaths , and he never knew any harm by him ; but being cross examin 'd , confest that he had a very bad Name , and was reputed to be a Buyer of Stolen Goods . John Martin , Cooper , John Beddow , John Rotheram , and others of his Neighbours in Holbourn near the Watch-house , with much ado , were brought to acknowledge , that he was a Man of a very ill Character , and notorious for buying of stolen Goods . All the Prisoner 's Witnesses instead of clearing his Reputation , serv 'd only to confirm what was already sworn against him . He was an old Offender , and the Jury found him Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] William Bristow , ( a Black ) of Aldgate was indicted for a Misdemeanor in breaking the Ware-house of Thomas Gayre , in the Night-time , with an Intention to steal the Goods of the said Thomas Gayre , on the 18th of August last . A Boy depos 'd , That waiting at the Door for his Uncle , Stephen Lefevre , he saw the Prisoner and another talking together , and afterward break open the Ware-house Door and go down ; he then alarm 'd the Watch , who took them in the Cellar . Caleb Williams Watchman depos 'd , That on the Boy 's Information , he and his Brother Watchman Frank Corbet , according to their Officer ( the Constable 's ) Command , went down the Cellar and shut the Door after them , and coming to the bottom of the Cellar Stairs , held up his Lanthorn , and happen 'd to cast his Eye upon the Prisoner , who was a Black . The Sight struck him Speechless , his Hair stood an End , and his Heart sunk into his Breeches , for he thought it could not possibly be any thing less than the Devil . While he was standing in this Consternation , the Prisoner 's Comrade slipt by them to another part of the Cellar . Mercy on me Frank , ( says this Evidence , for he had now recovered his Speech ) there 's something past by us . What shall we do ? The Boy coming down to their Assistance , they at length took heart and seiz 'd on the Prisoner and his Partner , who might easily have escap 'd if they had not been in as great fear as the Watchmen . They carried them to the Round-house , from whence before Morning , they broke out through the Cieling and escap 'd , but the Prisoner was soon after taken at Billingsgate . In his Defence he said , That he was got Drunk , and went down the Cellar to Sleep . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] William Davis of St. Martin in the Fields , was indicted for feloniously stealing two Holster Leather Caps , value 7 s. the Goods of our Sovereign Lord , on the 20th of September last . It appear 'd that while John Furnival was asleep upon the Quilts at the Guard at White-hall , the Prisoner came into the Stable , took the Caps off the Horse , knock 'd down a Boy who stood at the Stable Door , and run away ; the Boy cry 'd , stop Thief ; Furnival awaked , run after the Prisoner , and took one of the Caps out of his Bosom . But it appearing that the Caps were the Goods of John Furnival , and not of His Majesty , as they were charg 'd in the Indictment , the Court directed the Jury to acquit the Prisoner .
