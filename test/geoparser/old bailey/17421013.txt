I rode up to my Lord , and acquainted him with what had happened : Says he , my Retinue is very well provided , and my Fellows are all couragious , they shall pursue him : I described the Man to him ; says he , I remember such a Person as you speak of ; he had the Cape of his Coat about his Face , and he said , he looked like a sickly Sort of a Fellow ; I think he had the same Cloaths on then as the poor unhappy Man has now ; he said it was the first Fact that ever he committed . - There were three Crown Pieces ; two of them were King William 's , and one of them was Charles the Second 's . - I had them in my Pocket upon the Road for two or three Journeys together ; he confessed he took them from me : He had no Disguise , only the Cape of his Coat was buttoned round his Face . - I am positive that is the Man ; my Lord Carpenter 's Servants brought him up directly to my Lord Carpenter , and he confessed he was the Man that robbed me . - To the best of my Knowledge I can swear to this Money . Mr Lawrence . I was in Company with Mr Gates September 28 . I was in one Track , and Mr Gates in another ; the Prisoner came up to me first , and presented a Pistol to me , and without robbing me turned about to Mr Gates . Q . How came the Prisoner to turn from you to Mr Gates ? Lawrence .

Lord Carpenter 's Servant - Stockwell . As I was coming to London , the 28th of September , Mr Gates came up to my Lord , and said he had been robbed . By whom says my Lord ?

John Heaney otherwise Ceeney , was indicted for stealing a Silver Watch , val . 5 l. - and a Silver Watch Chain , val . 4 s. the Property of Henry Lane , in the Dwelling-House of John Lemmon . Henry Lane . On the 31st of August , between eight and nine in the Morning , I was going up Fleet-street , and a Gentleman like Man picked up a Shilling ; he said he had found a Shilling , and asked me to drink part of a Pint of Wine , which I accepted of . He went into Pope's-Court , in Bell-Yard ; and in this Court we met John Heaney ; says the Man , who picked up the Shilling , I have found a Shilling , and am going to treat this Man with a Glass of Wine , and desired him to go and take Part of it . We went into a House where there was a little Room in the Yard . They put me into the inner Part of the Room , and the Prisoner was next to the Door ; after they had drank some Wine , they began to talk of cutting of Cards , particularly the Prisoner , who went out under a Pretence of buying Cards ; but I believe he had them in his Pocket at the Time , because he returned so quick ; the Prisoner and the other played , I was prevailed on to bet a Shilling , and I won two Shillings ; so this Man who had picked up the Shilling , he cut good Cards , Court Cards ; says he to me , Do you cut ; I apprehend he had two Packs , for when I came to cut , I cut nothing but Aces and Duces , and the like , and I lost the two Shillings that I had got . Says he , I will venture another Shilling , says I , I have never a Shilling : What , says he , have you no Watch nor nothing to put down ? Yes , says I , I have a Watch , so I put my Watch down upon the Table , and cut two or three Times ; still the Cards were low , that I lost every Time ; I lost two or three Shillings that Way ; and please you , my Lord , he took up my Watch and went away with it directly . I went out as fast as I could , but he was gone , and I saw no more of him till about a Fortnight afterwards ; as I was coming up Newgate-street I met with him , and one more of his Companions ; as soon as ever he saw me , he began to run ; I cried out Stop Thief , and caught him before he got to the End of the Street ; but the other was a brisk Fellow , and he got off ; says the Prisoner , if you will release me you shall have your Watch again . He begged me to go into a Publick-House , and the People persuaded me to let him go in ; said they , may be you may have your Watch again ; and he said I should have my Watch . So some of the People persuaded me to make it up , and others not to make it up , for if I did he might trouble me ; so I would not make it up , but would have him before a Magistrate ; he did not care to walk on Foot , but he would have a Coach , and before we got to Guild-Hall , he was fumbling in his Pocket ; I was in Hopes I should have my Watch again , but they were two Packs of Cards that he had in his Pocket . Prisoner . Another Man put down a Ring to answer his Watch . I plaid till it came to Six Guineas , and won his Watch . Q . Did any Body put down a Ring ? Lane . Yes , one of his Companions did to bet with him . William Davis the Constable . I was at the Alehouse , while Mr Lane had the Prisoner there in the House , and he said if he would let him go , he would send for the Watch . Prisoner . My Lord , this Gentleman has sworn a Robbery upon me , when I won the Watch ; and it is very unlikely a Man should be robbed of his Watch at Noon-Day , and not make a Noise . Lane . My Lord , I was afraid of my Life , and did not care to make any Noise , for I had heard of some Murders and Robberies at that Time , that I was afraid to do it . Martha Blakesley says she has known the Prisoners two Years , gave him the Character of an honest Man , that he always kept good Hours ; that as he was a Watch-Maker , she thought he might have got his Living honestly and truly , without following this Course of Life . Frances Savage gave him much the same Character . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 125 , 126.

Michael Barron . On the first of October Russel came into my Shop , my Waistcoat and Banjan were behind the Counter ; I missed them presently after she was gone , no Body else was in the Room . Martha Jones . I charged Russel with them , she said she did not steal them , but another Person did , and gave them to her at the Door , and that she had sold them to the Prisoner , Brown , for three Pence . Brown owned she had them , but would not part with them , for she had bought them and paid for them . Anne Hodges . The Girl , Russel , told me that she carried them to Brown , who said she would give a Shilling for them , that she gave her but three Pence , and put them into the Closet ; the Girl went to her the next Morning , and she said the Things were nailed . I suppose that is a Word used among Thieves . Russel Guilty 10 d. Brown Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 127 , 128 , 129.

Mary Stayner . I was at Mr. Raven 's , next Door to Mrs. Dicks 's in Fetter-Lane , August 2. and heard a dreadful Cry of Murder . I run into the Yard and screamed out , I insisted on the House being broke open ; I saw some Blood come against the Window , and I saw a Man in a woollen Cap peep through the Window , but I can not tell who it was : When the House was broke open , we went up and found Mrs Dicks lying in a very deplorable Manner , in her gore Blood . - She lived two Hours after . - She was a Widow Gentlewoman of 74 Years of Age , no Body lived with her : When I came into the Room her Senses were gone ; I found her upon her Back upon the Floor ; we laid her upon the Bed , and the Blood run through the Ceiling ; she had several Marks , one was on the Left-side of the Head , near the Temple ; it was a dreadful Cut . - I think it was a Cut by a Bar , and not by a Knife ; she had several other Wounds on her Neck and Breast ; she lived in this Condition from a Quarter of an Hour before seven in the Morning till eleven , she was not capable of being undressed , she could only say , O Lord ! O Lord ! The Surgeon said , Madam , as you can speak you should tell who did it , but she only said , Lord ! Lord ! Prisoner . Can you say it was me ? Stayner . I do not say it was you . Robert Nannay , Surgeon . I came there about an Hour an half after the Accident , and found she had left a great deal of Blood . She had four or five Wounds in her Head ; two of them were attended with a Fracture in her Skull , and her Brain was wounded . The Wound was upon the left Side of the Head , upon the Temple ; which was the Occasion of her Death . The Prisoner had hid himself in the Cellar , and was found there , whilst I was dressing the Woman : I asked him how he came to do such a villainous Thing ; he said she assaulted him first with a Poker , or some such Thing . I asked her who did it , but she was not able to say any more than Lord ! Lord ! John Palmer . I was there about eight o'Clock in the Morning : I searched the House , and found the Prisoner at the Bar in the Cellar , under a Hamper . I asked him how he came to use the Gentlewoman in so barbarous a Manner ; he denied it a little at first , and desired to see the Gentlewoman . I taxed him with it , and he owned afterwards the committing of the Fact . Prisoner . Can you swear I was the Person that did it ? Palmer . There was no body else in the House : Near the Place where he was I found an Iron , which I suppose he did it with , covered over with some Dirt ; it was a Piece of an Iron Bar ; this is the Iron , it was bloody when I took it from under the Dirt ; the Prisoner 's Hand was very bloody . - I can not say whether his Linnen was bloody or not . Mr Cooch , the Constable . The Prisoner 's Master hearing a Cry of Murder in the House , sent for me to come directly ; when I came , he said , he believed there was somebody murdered in the House , and desired I would get the Door broke open as soon as possible : I fetched a Smith , and broke open the Door , and saw the Blood running through the Floor , upon the Cieling . I got a Surgeon , and he said , she could not live above two or three Hours . A Woman told me , she saw a Man with a Woollen Cap put the Curtain on one Side , and look through the Window ; and then I set two or three People to watch , that he did not get away . My Lad took a Stick and a Bayonet , and searched the Cellar ; he struck a Hamper , and out jumps the Prisoner ; he said he wanted to see Mrs. Dicks , to know whether she would live : Said I , Tom , how came your Hand bloody ? Why , said he , my Nose has bled . Said I , you lying Rogue , it has not bled . I turn 'd his Head up , and saw it had not . - His Hand was all over bloody , to his Fingers Ends . I got a Coach , in order to carry him before an Alderman . When he was in the Coach , I asked him , how he came to do such a Thing as this ? He said , he could not help it , he did not do it with a Design to murder her , but to rob her . He said he had a Design to do it for five or six Weeks , but his Heart always misgave him . He told the Alderman it was a Bar that he did it with , and that it lay somewhere in the Cellar . He said he had got out of his Bed several times with an Intent to do it ; but on the 1st of August he resolved to do it : He said he went in at the Cellar-Window , between four and five in the Morning , and lay concealed till between six and seven : He wrenched the Lock of the Stairs-foot Door off , in order to get to her . She came down some of the Stairs , and said , Tom , what do you want ? but she run back , frightened , into the Room , and he run after her , with the Bar in his Hand : She clapped a Chair and Table against the Door , and took up the Poker or Tongs to strike him with , and he knocked her down , and repeated the Blows till he thought he had killed her , as he confessed himself . He said , when he thought he had killed her , he was going to rob the Drawers , but her crying out Murder , and the People making a Noise without , and the Blood running down , he run down into the Cellar , and hid himself under a Hamper . - She crying out , he was afraid of being discovered , and so murdered her . Prisoner . You have said several Things , that as I am a little deaf , I could not hear : Did you see me take the Lock off the Door ? Coach . No , I did not . Thomas Jefferies . The Constable sent for me to aid and assist him to get into the House . I went and fetched a Ladder , and set it up against the Side of the House , and looked in at the Window , and saw the Gentlewoman lying in her Blood . I heard the Prisoner say , he did not design to murder her , but she struck at him with the Poker , and he struck at her again , and followed his Blows till he brought her to that Condition . His Confession was taken in Writing , but it was not signed . He said he designed to do it a Fortnight or three Weeks before , but he was very sleepy , and had slept his Time away . Mr Jefferies likewise confirmed great Part of the former Evidence . Guilty , Death . 131.

When I was taken before the Duke of Bedford , the Prosecutors were present , and made me drunk with Wine , and one thing or another , that I was quite in Liquor , and did not know what I did ; they prosessed great Friendship to me if I would discover any Thing of the Matter : They promised punctually they would no ways hurt me , if they could be made Retaliation for the Loss - they frightened me so I did not know what to do ; the next Day I had some Friends came to me , and they asked me whether I knew what I had done ; and I said I did not know what I had done . Mr. Bramston . This Examination was read over to him before the Duke of Bedford , there were neither Threats , or Promises , but he did it voluntarily . Guilty , Death . 132. Robert Bird , of St Giles 's Cripplegate , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-House of Samuel Sanders , about the Hour of one in the Night , and taking from thence 116 Ells of Linnen , called Gulix Holland , value 28 l. 623 Lawn Handkerchiefs , value 44 l. and 90 Yards of Irish Linnen , value 3 l. 10 s. the Goods of Samuel Sanders , August 21 . Samuel Sanders . The 21st of August last , about two in the Morning , the Watchman called me up , and told me the Flap of my Cellar-Window was open , I rose in a Fright and looked out and saw the Cellar-Window was broke next the Street ; said I my dear , I am afraid we shall be killed , for I believe the Rogues are in the House , for the Watchman stands at the Flap of the Cellar-Door , which was broke open ; it fastens with two Bolts , and a Dog into a Kirb ; my Goods were in a little Warehouse below Stairs , which I put things into that my Shop will not hold . Mary Paine . I fastened the Cellar Window at half an Hour after eight o'Clock on the Friday Night , August 20. William Pritchet . On the 21st of August , between twelve and one on Saturday Morning , as I was going Home in order to go to Bed , I met Joseph Kent , and Robert Bird , the Prisoner ; said I , where are you going ? I will go along with you . Damn you , said they , we do n't want your Company . This was in Cock's-head-Court , in Golden-Lane , where Kent lives ; says Kent 's Wife , will you be a Penny ? So she gave me 2 d. and I put a Penny to it , and we had a Pot of Beer : While we were drinking it , says Kent 's Wife , somebody is coming up Stairs . Kent came up with a Load upon his Back , and Bird with two long Pieces rolled up under his Arm , which seemed to me to be Cloth , and Kent put the Goods into a Closet in his Room : Seeing this , I had a Suspicion they had been a robbing : They went out again , and I followed them : They went to the Prosecutor 's House : The Prisoner at the Bar went into the Cellar , and Kent stood at the Top of the Stairs , receiving the Goods from the Prisoner , and putting them into a Bag . Says I , what do you do here ? Says Kent , Damn you , as you are come , take this up , and carry it away ; and I being in Liquor , fell down before I had got a Stones-throw . When I came to Ken t 's House , I fell down upon the Stairs , with a Load upon my Back . When I came up Stairs , the Goods were all in the Middle of the Room ; then they took the Goods up again , and went away : When we got to Grub-street , says Kent , Pritchet , you may go back again now . Said I , you may as well let me see where the Goods go now . No , by G - d , says he , you shall not . When I came back again , the Goods were all gone . Says Kent to me , Robert Bird has got an old Coat , he will give you that for your Trouble . Mary Stapleton . I live next Door to Kent 's House : About two o'Clock in the Morning , I saw Bird and Kent bring several Bundles into Kent 's House , and carry them out again afterwards . William Rugby , the Constable . I had my Lord Mayor 's Warrant to search for these Goods , and I found them in an empty House , Aug. 21 , about six o'Clock in the Evening . Sanders . I have something to say to the Court with respect to the intended Sale of these Goods : They were to have been sold to some Jews , but they were so conscientious , they would not buy any thing of a Sunday ; but this Holland , that cost me 4 s. an Ell , they were to sell them at 4 d. a Yard . Guilty , Death . Mr. Sanders . My Lord , I beg that Pritchet may be detained in the Compter , in order to give Evidence against the other ( Kent ) when he is taken . He is an incorrigible Villain ; I shall catch him very quickly . Pritchet gave his own Consent to it : He said he could work in the Compter ; and had rather be there than not , for fear of being killed . 133. Thomas Dutton was indicted for stealing one Feather-Bed and Bolster , value 40 s. a Chimney-Glass , two Sconces , and other Houshold Furniture , in his Lodging , the Goods of John Denny , Aug. 24 . Mary Denny . I lost these Goods out of the Lodging which I let to the Prisoner , ready furnished ; he was to pay 3 s. for the first Week , and 2 s. 6 d. a Week afterwards : He was not there above a Week . I broke open the Door of his Room and found these Things missing . He owned to me , that he sold the Chimney-Glass and Sconces , and the Feather-Bed . William Cadwallader , a Pawnbroker , proved , that he pawned several of these Things to him . - Fountaine . He left a Pillow , Bolster , and Sheets , at my House at Islington , while he went to look for his Wife and Sister , who were going into the Country . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 134. William Cavenagh * was indicted for stealing a Gold Ring , value 16 s. the Property of Ann Fielding , Oct. 9 . No Prosecutor appearing , he was acquitted . * He was an Accomplice with , and Evidence against Mat . Mooney , condemned last Sessions for a Robbery on the Highway . He is now detained for a Robbery in Surrey . The Court ordered the Prosecutor 's Recognizance to be estreated . 135. William Bird was indicted for that he , on the 16th of July , & c. in and upon one Phillis Wells , did feloniously , wilfully , and of his Malice aforethought , make an Assault , and her the said Phillis , then being in a certain close Room , called the Hole , then being Part of a Building called St Martin 's Round-House , did feloniously , wilfully , and of his Malice aforethought , confine and continue , against the Will of the said Phillis , for a great Space of Time , to wit , for the Space of eight Hours , during great Part of which Time , to wit , for the Space of four Hours thereof , there were twenty other Persons confined as Prisoners by the said William Bird , in the same close Room , which was not of sufficient Largeness to confine twenty Persons therein for the Space of three Hours , without manifest Danger of their Lives ; by which said confining and continuing of her the said Phillis , by the said William Bird , in Manner aforesaid , she the said Phillis , on the said 16th of July , within the said close Room , was suffocated , and of the said Suffocation died , and so the said William Bird , on the said Day , in the said Year , Parish , and County , [ as had been laid above ] the said Phillis Wells did feloniously , & c. kill and murder . [ The Case having been fully opened by the Council , and printed at length in the last Sessions-Paper , we shall now begin with the Evidence . ] Thomas Morris . I was the Person charged by the High-Constable with Phillis Wells , and went along with her to the Watch-House . I told the High-Constable that I knew her to be an honest Girl , and that I would conduct him to the Round-House , but would take no Charge of her . I believe the High-Constable sent one Clark with her . She was left in the Round-House , and I saw her no more , till I saw her dead in the Bone-House . She has a Brother-in-Law whose Name is Frazer ; he is a House keeper in my Beat ; I went and acquainted him - it was between two and three o'Clock in the Morning . When the High-Constable called out Watch , - she told him she was come from Deptford , and that she had been about her lawful Affairs . - I told Mrs. Bird I knew her . Bird . I desire he may be asked , what my general Behaviour to the Prisoners is ? Court . Do you hear of any Complaints as to his Behaviour to the Prisoners ? Morris . No ; only if they have been rude , he has sent them down into that Place . I do not know of any ill Usage to the Prisoners . - I have heard disorderly People in the Street speak against him . - Some speak good , and some speak had of him . Coun . What is his general Character ? Is he a kind Goaler , or is he otherwise ? Morris . I can not make any Answer to that : - The Girl was in good Health , only frightened , to be put into such a Place which she never was in before . Mary Saint . I know Phillis Wells ; I saw her in the Round-House about four o'Clock in the Morning , and spoke to her through the Window ; the Place was full , she stood in the Middle , - my Mistress sent me there - Mrs Frazer . She was then in seeming good Health , and spoke freely to me . Said I , Phil , In the Name of God , how came you here ? She cried to me , Mary Saint , for God 's Sake give me a little Water ? I stepped up to Mrs Bird for a little Water , and she said they should have no such Thing . Council . That is nothing at all , a Man must not be hanged for his Wife . Saint . I did not speak to William Bird . - Between two and three o'Clock in the Afternoon I found her dead upon the Bench . - She came from Deptford that Morning . - She had a lightish Callimanco Gown on . - I staid at the Window about three Quarters of an Hour , - the Window was open when I was there . I can not tell what Number of Persons there were in ; they cried out they should all be smothered . Charles Frazer . On the 16th of July , about three o'Clock , the Watchman called me as usual . - I sell Physical Herbs ; and the Watchman told me , the High-Constable had taken up my Wife 's Sister , and that he had carried her to St Martin 's Round-House . - I did not go to the Round-House then , but went about my Business ; for I did not think there was any Danger : When I came back , which was about ten o'Clock , my Maid told me she had seen her there about five o'Clock in the Morning . About ten , or a little after , I went , and found her dead in the Hole , - there were two more dead , one lying on the Right-Hand of her , and the other on the Left . - She was lying upon a Bench . - She had a Camblet Gown on , or something like it , of a lightish Brown Colour . William Frazer . Charles Frazer is my Brother : Between ten and eleven I went to the Round-House , and went down into the Hole . - I saw Phillis Wells there , and she was dead . - I think she had on a whitish brown Gown . - She was a sober modest Woman . Robert Churchman then gave Evidence as on the former Trial . Bird . As he has served Constable , I ask him whether it is customary for the Door of the Hole that lets into the Passage to be left open ? Churchman . It can not be customary to leave it open , because it is a thing that hardly ever did happen , to have so many Prisoners in it . Mary Cosier . - We cried out Fire and Murder ; that there were People in Labour , For God 's Sake have Mercy upon us , or we had better be hanged out of the Way . One Woman pulled her Shoe off , and struck the Ceiling with it to make them hear . - We could but just stand upright in the Hole . I had but three half-pence in the World , and I offered that for a little Air . - Bird did not think he had fastened the Door enough before , but he brought down a Poker to fasten it with . - I suppose it was because we made such a Noise for Water , Air , and Light . I staid the last in the Hole except three besides the dead Women . There were five or six in Fits , - that was owing to the Heat of the Place ; we cried out , There were Women in Fits , Women in Labour , and Women with Child ; Have Mercy upon the Infants , if you have none upon us ? - I do not know whether Bird heard us . If that Door had been opened that goes to the Stairs , I believe it would have saved all their Lives ; for we wanted Air most . - I went down about twelve o'Clock , and there was a continual Cry from that Time till ten o'Clock in the Morning . The Skin of my Face rose in Blisters , and all came off . In the rest , she agreed with her former Evidence . Elizabeth Amey ( having given much the same Account as on the former Trial ) . When the Door was opened , about half an Hour after ten in the Morning , some came out stark naked . I came up with a Bed-Gown on , and it was so wet you might have rung the Sweat out of it . - Mrs Bird gave me some stinking Water , - I drank that , and I believe I drank about three Quarts of clean Water . Bird said once to Mary Wood , the Window should be left open , and afterwards he shut it ; I believe it was upon Account of a Woman 's bringing some spiritual Liquor . - There was Room enough above Stairs , but we could not have it without Money . - Sarah Bland was in Fits , and carried to the Workhouse as dead , and did not come to herself for two Days . Bird . Did not you say you would be up with me upon some Account or other ? Did not you live at the House in Oxendon Street , where the Coachman was murdered ? * Amey . I was then a Waiter at Mr Eastmead 's Bagnio ; I never lay a Night in that House in my Life . * See the Trials in Mr Alderman Perry 's Mayoralty , No . 390. page 110 . And in Sir John Salter 's Mayoralty , No . 159. page 89. and No . 274. page 163. Sarah Starks . I was carried to the Round-House about half an Hour after Eleven , and put into the Hole by Mr Bird . - I believe there might be six down there then , but it was so dark , I could not well see how many . - I believe there might be twenty-six at last . - The Window was open when I first went down , and I believe might be open for the Space of a Quarter of an Hour , and then it was That ; it was opened again a Quarter before Four , and shut again a Quarter before Five . - We were crying out for Water and Air , and Mr Bird would not let us have it . - Mr Bird came down several Times - And we asked him for Water and Air , and he told us we should neither have Air nor Water . - I am positively sure of it . - I am sure he was the Man that made Answer so several times . There was one Shilling offered for a Pint of Water ; we raised among ourselves four Shillings for a Gallon ; he said we should not have any ; there was one Woman he gave a Blow on her Head . - He struck her because she wanted to get up Stairs to have a drop of Wine or something to comfort her . - He said we should all suffer for her , and might die and be damned . - I cried out Fire and Murder . - Bird shut the Window the last Time . - He said twice that we might die and be damned , and we should stay till let out by the High-Constable ; and the last Time he came down he struck a Woman , gave her a Kick , and pushed her away from him . - He did not say , die and be damned , when he shut the Window , it was when he shut the Door . Bird . Do you think my Intention in shutting the Window was to stifle them , or to keep them sober , in order to go before a Magistrate . Starks . I believe his Intention was to stifle us all if he could . Ann Norton . I was taken out of my Bed from my Husband and carried to the Watchhouse , about one o'Clock in the Morning . - I was kept above Stairs , I was not carried into the Hole . - I had a Friend with me , and spent Money there , and paid Six-pence for sitting up Stairs . - That was the Reason I did not go down into the Hole . - I heard them cry out for Air and Water ; and they cried out Fire and Murder , and that there was a Woman in Labour . I heard them cry they would give a Shilling for a Quart of Water , and five Shillings for a Gallon : Bird sat writing at the Table then , and said , Damn the Bitches they want Gin . On their crying out they should die , he said , they might die and be damned ; this was between six and seven in the Morning . - I heard him say this . - I did indeed ; there was a Woman supplying them with Water through a Tobacco-Pipe , and Bird said he caught them drinking of Gin ; there was Henry Norton in the same Room with me , and a young Man whose Name is William , he is a Coach-maker in Long-Acre . - Bird ordered Bushel to go down and put some Prisoners in , and Bushel came up and said he could put no more in ; and Bird said , let me go down , I will put them in , and he pushed them down Stairs one over another . - He went down with a Poker to fasten the Door ; there was Room for a great many more above Stairs . - Bird went to Bed about eight o'Clock . Bird . You say you were kept above Stairs , did you pay any thing for it ? Norton . Yes , I did , I paid Six-pence for a Quartern of Usquebaugh , and Six pence to your Wife for sitting up . Bird . I never heard any thing of that before ; have not you expressed yourself much in my Favour , and said , that I endeavoured to get you examined last Sessions for me ? Norton . No , Mr Bird , you are wrong there , when I was asked whether I would be examined of your Side , I said no , I would not wrong my Conscience so much . Sarah Bland was consistent with her former Evidence , and gave this Account of the Deceased ; there was a young Woman , who said her Name was Wells , and that she had been at Kensington , and was going to her Brother with some Coltsfoot when she was taken up : ( My Cousin Maurice was then on my Knee . ) Says she , I do not know what I have done ; if my Brother knew it , he would grow crazy . She was faint , and said , If I could get a Drop of Water I should be better ; but no Support came to us after the Door was shut ; nobody came near us : She died , I can not tell whether on the Bench , or on the Ground . She seemed to be very well in Health when she came in , but she took on upon Account of being carried there . - Bird himself brought her down . - We told him we wanted Water ; he said , Water , you Bitches , be damned - He did not say die , then . Elizabeth Surridge was very exact with her former Evidence , as was Mr Leathes Serjeant Burns gave the like Account as to the Cries and Condition of the Women , as in the former Trial . Mr Bushel the Beadle called . Bird . My Lord , I submit it to your Lordship , whether he is a proper Witness ; because he attended the Constable of the Night along with me ? Court . Yes , he is . He was then sworn , and gave an Account of being sent down with the three Women , as at the last Sessions . Q . Would the upper Door of the Stairs have been secure , if the Women had been let out into the Passage ? Bushel . I believe it might : There is a Lock and two Bolts to the Door , but it is not strong at all : They could not have got out of the Round-House . - Three died in the Hole , one got up upon the Stairs , and died there : About ten Minutes after she got out , Bird said to one of the Women that did not die , one Betty Eaton , when she was brought out of the Hole , and sat in a Chair in the Chimney , You Bitch of Hell , no Carrion will kill a Crow . - She made no Reply , for I believe she could not well speak : She was brought up without a Cap , and was almost stifled . Bird . Pray , upon my being informed , that some of the People were ill , did not I send you for Spirits , and for People to bleed them . Bushel . You did not send me , you sent Broadbent . You said you would send the Chair from the Workhouse , but you did not return again ; but the Chair was brought at last . Bird . Are you sure of it ? Recollect yourself . Bushel . You did not come back to the Round-House : I know you sent for a Man to bleed them . I do not know any Thing else you did . - [ John Tilton , who was called at the former Trial on Behalf of the Prisoner , was now examined on the Part of the Crown ; and gave the same Evidence as to the Time of his being at the Round-house , and of Bird 's putting down some Prisoners into the Hole , after Bushel told him he could put no more in , for there were so many they would be stifled ; and likewise what passed in relation to leaving open the Door of the Hole ] Bird Was there any Order given to leave the Shutter open ? Who gave the Order ? Tilton . There was an Order given that they might have Air : It was open at five o'Clock , when I went away , and I desired it might be kept open . Bird . Did you hear any Out-cry of Murder ? Tilton . No , I did not hear any Out-cry at all . I was in the Room with Bird and the Constable of the Night . Bird . Did you hear any Cry of Murder , Mr Bushel ? Bushel . No , I did not . Elizabeth Desborough . I was confined in St Martin 's Round-house July 16 . Bushel came down with some Prisoners , I can not say what Time it was , nor how many he brought down . He went up and left the Door of the Hole open , and desired it might be left open , and the Door on the Top of the Stairs fastened ; he spoke this to Bird , but I can not say what Answer Bird made , but he came down directly , struck Elizabeth Amey , pulled her Cap off her Head , pushed us all together , and said he would make Room ; he made use of several Expressions , but I can not tell what they were . Q . Did any of you get into the Passage when the Door was open ? Desborough . We did not go out into the Passage , I believe some might stand just on the outside of the Door . - When Bushel left the Door open , he said it was too close with it shut . There was some Refreshment came into us from the Air , when the Door was open . Mr. Perkins the Surgeon , and Mr Colclough , who were sent for to bleed these People , gave the same Account now , of their Condition , as they did at the former Trial . Q . Do you think the Place would contain twenty Persons for the Space of three Hours , without manifest Danger of their Lives ? Perkins . I do not think it would , if the Doors and Windows were shut . - I apprehend they were suffocated for want of a due Quantity of Air , for Inspiration and Respiration . Bird . Were any of the Bodies opened ? Perkins . No , Sir , - they said there was one of the Women with Child , but she was not with Child ; she had a Dropsy . Bird . As to the Cause of the Suffocation , I desire to know if a Person had been opened , whether it could not have been distinguished , whether the Suffocation was occasioned by Liquor , or for want of Air ? It was the Opinion of Sir Hans Sloane , in a Case that happened at Hertford some Years ago * , that two Spoonfuls of Liquor will suffocate a Person . * See the late Edition of State-Trials , Vol . V. pag . 217 . Q. to Colclough . Would that Place contain twenty Persons three Hours , without manifest Danger of their Lives ? Colclough . No , I think not ; I think I must have been dead , if I was in such a Heat as that for that Time . - I think it is impossible to live under those Circumstances , in such hot Weather ; indeed Winter Time makes a Difference . - Their Death was occasioned , in my Opinion , through the Number of People , which were confined there , and the want of Air and Water . Q . Was that in your Opinion the Occasion of their Death ? Colclough . I am sure of it . William Bird . I am the unhappy Person who stands charged with the Crime of Murder ; a Crime of the highest Nature ; and I hope I shall , with your Lordship 's Assistance , in Points of Law , bring myself off this Charge ; and I hope what has been clamoured abroad , will not have any Effect upon the Gentlemen here . I shall endeavour to bring Witnesses of sufficient Credit to be believed : This was occasioned by a Search-Warrant , from Justice De Veil , to bring to our House such Persons as were taken up in the Street , & c. The Warrant was to be returned at eight o'Clock in the Morning , and if the proper Officer had came at the Time , this Misfortune would not have happened . I never went to Bed , I only lay down at the Feet of the Bed at seven o'Clock , and indeed I lay till between nine and ten . I never heard any thing of an Outcry of Murder , or any thing else ; and as soon as I knew of the Misfortune , I made Application for Assistance to relieve them . As to the Number of People in the Hole , I did not know ; and I had no Occasion to try the Number it could hold , till this unhappy Occasion : I had nothing to get , no Liquor to sell , nor any Opportunity of doing any Thing to make a Property of them ; and I do declare this unhappy Affair was without my Knowledge or Inclination . [ William Malpas called for the Prisoner . ] Bird . Will your Lordship please to order him to give you a particular Account of this Affair , and to speak nothing but the Truth ? William Malpas . My Lord , I was taken up the 15th of July at Night , among the unhappy Persons that died . During the whole Night I did not see the Prisoner at the Bar use any Cruelty towards them . - I was there from about a Quarter before Eleven at Night , till about Ten the next Morning . I was above Stairs all the while . - I was not put down into the Hole , because the Prisoner was a particular Acquaintance of my Mother 's , and knew all my Friends . I went down to the Hole to carry a Candle , which was knocked out by one of the Persons confined . - The Door was open when I went down ; this was about four o'Clock in the Morning ; one of the Persons was bustling to get out , Mr Bird put her in , and then I believe shut the Door . - I did not go into the Hole , I only stood at the Bottom of the Stairs . Bird . Pray , Mr Malpas , give an Account to the Court and the Jury , what Part I acted , and who acted that Night . Malpas . He sat writing most Part of the Night . - In the Morning , Mr Akins , the Constable of the Night , ordered the House to be cleared two or three Times before he went away . Bird . Did I do this of my own Head , or by the Direction of the Constable ? Malpas . By the Direction of the Constable . Bird . Did I do any thing without the Constable 's Order ? Malpas . No . Bird . Did I make any Objection to the Discharge of Persons who were brought in by the Watchman for breaking of Windows , and were discharged by the Constable ? Malpas . No . Q . Did you know any one that was called by the Name of Wells ? Malpas . No , I did not . Bird . Did I put any of them down , or go down , till between four and five , when the Constable went down ? I did not go down before that Time . Malpas . I did not see him go down . Bird . Who knocked the Candle out of my Hand ? Malpas . One of the Prisoners , her Name was Amey . Bird . How did she behave before she was put into the Hole ? Malpas . She behaved in a very abrupt Manner , and bred Differences . I believe she was ordered down at first by the Constable of the Night . Bird . What Time was it in the Morning that I laid down ? Malpas . It was a little after Six . Bird . What Time did you call me again ? Malpas . About Nine . - He laid down with his Waistcoat on . Bird . During the Time I sat up , did you hear any Outcry of Murder , or Water , or that the Women were ready to be delivered of Children . Malpas . There was a great Noise from first to last , before they were put down into the Hole , and after . Bird . The Place is so accustomed to Noises that one does not know whether there is Danger or no . Malpas . I did not hear any Cries of Murder while you were up . Bird . Did I shut the Window to do them an Injury , or what was it for ? Malpas . Bird said to the People who brought Liquor to them , you are not their Friends , how can they defend themselves in the Morning if they are in Liquor ? And when they came out , and he found how bad they were , he sent for a Surgeon to bleed them , and took all the Care he could of them . Bird . Do you know one Ann Norton . Malpas . I know her by her being up there ; she was sitting in the Room with me ; I spoke to her once since , and she said she would do Bird all the Service she could , for he had been very civil to her . Bird . Now she tells another Tale ; it has been said that I was up and down divers Times with Prisoners , to put them into the Hole ; it was impossible I could go down with the Prisoners , when there were near forty of them , and a Constable that could neither read nor write . I was obliged to sit with him to take an Account of their Names . Malpas . Several were put down by Watchmen . Bird . Pray did I drink with Serjeant Burns the value of two or three Shillings in Liquor ? Malpas . No , I do not think he did . Bird Where did the Liquor come from . Malpas . It was sent for out of Doors . Bird . I am sure I had none to sell : Pray did I take any Money of Mrs Norton to let her stay up ? Malpas . I did not see him take any . - There was no Body forced to have any Thing . Bird . If I had known any of them had been in Distress , do you think I would not have relieved them ? Malpas , I believe he would ; for he said , if I heard any Noise or Outcry upon any Occasion to call him , or if there was any thing wanting . Bird . Did you hear any Expression 't is said I made use of , of Die and be damned ? Malpas . I did not hear any such Words . Bird . If I did , it was an inadvertent Expression of my Tongue , and did not come from my Heart . Q . Where was Bird when he called for a Candle ? Malpas . He was below , I saw him struggling with Amey ; she wanted to get out , and the Door was immediately shut up by Mr Bird . Bird . I went down to see that all was safe . Q . How many Prisoners were there in the Hole when you carried the Candle down ? Malpas . I do not know , but it seemed to be full . Q . Did you find any disagreeable Smell or Stench ? Malpas . I do not remember that I did . Q . Do you remember any thing of Bushel 's coming up , and saying , he could not put any more down ? Malpas . I heard something said of that , but I can not tell who said it . Q. I ask you upon your Oath whether it was not Bushel ? Malpas . I can not tell . Q . Was there no Reason assigned why they could not be put in , that they would be stifled , or something like that ? Malpas . I can not make any Answer to that . Q . When the Door was desired to be left open , did not you hear whether it was for fear the Prisoners should be stifled ? Malpas . I did hear it mentioned , but who spoke it I can not tell . Q . Did not the Constable , when he went away , desire the Shutter of the Hole to be lest open ? Malpas . I do not know , it was open when he went ; it was shut again between Five and Six by Bird 's Son , because they should not have Gin brought them . - I did not see Mr Bird shut it . - The Room above extends over the two Holes and the Passage , and over that Room Mr Bird and his Family lie . Elizabeth Beaumont . I was taken out of my own House , and brought into the Round-house , about half an Hour after eleven at Night , and staid in the Drinking-Room till five in the Morning , and was in another Room above Stairs till nine . I saw no Misbehaviour in Bird , and did not hear any of the Prisoners give him an ill Word ; he staid most Part of the Night by the Constable writing . - I do not know that he went down all Night . At five o'Clock in the Morning , the Constable of the Night and the Beadle insisted on the Room being cleared before they went . - I did not hear any Body cry out as if they were in Distress . Q . Did you hear any singing ? Beaumont . Yes , I heard them singing very much . - I heard them singing in the Room where the Women were . Court . Sure you are mistaken ! Beaumont . Indeed I am not . Court . - This Singing you speak of , are you sure it was in the Room where the Women were ? Beaumont . It was Women 's Voices . Court . Are you sure of it ? Beaumont . There were Men down , as well as Women ; it might be the Women , or it might be the Men . Q . What was the Reason of your being above Stairs ? Did you pay any thing for it ? Beaumont . I had no Money to pay : I went down , and he said , Damn you , come up , I have more already than I know what to do with : There were five or six more came up with me . Coun . You say you saw nothing amiss in his Behaviour , you mean to yourself , for he was very civil to you ; how came you to be used so civilly ? Beaumont . There were several Gentlemen , who were Officers of the Parish ; they saw me take on very much , and saw my Condition , that I was with Child , and they desired I might not be put into the Hole ; he behaved very well to all for what I know , - if there had been any Complaints , I must have heard them . Q . You said there were five or six went up with you : What became of them afterwards ? Beaumont . The Constable of the Night and the Beadle went down again with them , and I went up to sit on the Bed-side . - I am a single Woman . - I was not in the same Room with Mr Bird ; the Rooms are parted off . - When the Constable of the Night had put them in , he made a Speech , and said , I have put them in , and you could not . Court . What Speech did he make ? Beaumont . The Constable of the Night said , that he had put them in , when Bird could not . - That tall Man ( Bushel ) was there all the Night , but he was very drunk . Court to Bushel . Who was there ? Bushel . There was the Constable of the Night , Tilton , and I , and another Beadle who came out of Curiosity . Akins , the Constable , was called for by the Court . Q . Was that Man [ pointing to Akins ] Constable of the Night ? Beaumont . Yes . Q . Was that the Man that said , I have put them in , and you could not ? Beaumont . Yes , that is the Man . - I did not say it was Mr Bushel that made that Speech . Court to Akins . Did you go down with any Woman into the Hole ? Akins . No , I did not . Court . Did you declare , that what Bird could not do , you did ? Akins . No , my Lord ; Bird knows I did not . Court . You hear what that Woman says , did you say so , or did you not ? Akins . No , I did not . Q . Do you know who said it ? Akins . I heard no such Expression : I carried none down all the Year . Bushel . Upon my Oath Bird said , I have put them in in a Minute that you could not . Bird . This was not from Good will . Tilton . Bird said , that Akins never did stir down . Bird . Mr. Akins , you swore you were down four or five Steps : I shall catch you by and by . - What Time did you go away ? Akins . I went away at half an Hour after Four . - I never heard any Cries before I went away . - Yes , I did hear Singing - I can not tell whether it was from the Mens Hole , or the Womens Hole . - It was between two and three o'Clock . - I gave no Orders whether the Window should be shut or open . Mr. Hooper . I am a Surgeon and Apothecary ; being informed of what had happened at the Round-House , I went there between eleven and twelve , and saw Mr Colclough bleeding the Women . I thought it best , for Expedition , to cut them down the temporal Artery . I endeavoured to bleed one , but to no Purpose ; there was another that expired about an Hour afterwards ; I thought it a Duty incumbent on me , to desire Mr Colclough to bleed some of the others , and they did well . Bird and his Wife were both there , he behaved with a great deal of Humanity . There were Drops and Water ready , and we had what we wanted , as often as we called . Bird . Did you ever hear in the Neighbourhood of any Complaints of my using People ill ? Hooper . I never heard any Thing one Way or other . - It is my Opinion , that the Occasion of their Death was from the want of Air , and the Liquor that they had . - Want of Air only might occasion it : This want of Air was the more prejudicial to them , as they had had too much Liquor before . They would have breathed freer without it . William Anderson , one of the Beadles . I came to the Round-House about seven o'Clock in the Morning : I asked Mr Bird how many Prisoners he had , he said , he believed he had about thirty ; I staid about five or six Minutes , and went away , and came again about ten o'Clock . One told me there was a particular Acquaintance of his taken up and put in the Hole . I went about ten o'Clock and asked for Bird , they said he was in Bed , and went up and called him , and he came down ; I opened the Door , in order to let her out ; as soon as the Door was open , the People bounced out directly upon us ; the Place was very nauseous , and the smell so strong , that I thought it would have struck me down ; they called out for Water , for they were quite stifled : I fetched some Water from the Pump , they drank that up , and I got them some more . - At seven o'Clock there were no Outcries , but at ten there was a great Outcry . Bird . If your Lordship will please to observe this was in the Time I went to lay down in my Wastcoat : If they had come at the Return of the Warrant , this Accident might not have happened . William Cluer I never knew but what Mr Bird behaved very well , ever since I have known him , which is since the first of March last . I live next Door to the Watch-house , but was out of my House that Night . William Harris . I served the Office of Constable about half a Year , and I never saw Mr Bird behave amiss to any of the Prisoners ; sometimes when he was in Liquor he would be a little noisy . Bird . It is customary to put People out of the common Room when the Watch breaks up . Harris . I used always to put them down into the Hole when the Watch broke up . - If they behaved any ways disorderly we put them into the Hole , before the Watch goes off ; if they behave civilly we let them stay above . - I never put any down into the Hole while I was Constable , if they behaved well before I went away . Mark Coney . I served the Office of a Constable last Year , and I can not say he committed any Crime , misbehaved , or used People ill in my Time : When we go off in a Morning we put the Prisoners into the Hole for Security , against the next Day . - I always used to put them in , I do not know whether I was right or wrong . - If they behaved civilly I did not put them in before I went away : - I never had above seven or eight Prisoners at a Time ; for we had no Search-Warrants in my Year . - He always behaved well , except he was in Liquor , and then I used to bid him go to Bed , and he would go . John Chambers . I served the Office of Constable two Years ago , I never saw him behave cruel or barbarous to any Prisoner , but used to be very kind to them . - It is a Custom between four and five o'Clock , or according as the Season of the Year is , to clear the House before the Watch goes off ; some go up Stairs to Bed , and others go down into the Hole . - If they behave well we do not put them into the Hole , but let them sit in the Room by the Fire . - It is Mr Bird 's Misfortune to have a hasty way of talking , but he does not use them ill. Philip Duggin , ( some time Clerk under the Governor of Bridewell ) he has brought a great many Prisoners to us , I never heard any Complaints of him . Bird . Have not you known me according to my Circumstances to give them Rolls or Half-pence . Duggin . Yes , to the best of my Remembrance he has , and spoke to me that they might be civilly used . William Baily . I have known him sixteen Years , and have been with him when he has bestowed Charity to People in Straits : I do not think him to be that tyrannical Person which he is represented to be . Bird . I will not take up any more of your Lordship 's Time , I hope I have established my Character , and I leave my Case to your Lordship and the Jury . King 's Council . As you have led us into it , we shall call some Persons to your Character ; so if you would call any more do it now . James Calf . I have known him four or five Years , and believe him to be a very honest Man ; I know several good-natured Acts which he has done for People ; as to his Usage of his Prisoners , I know nothing of that , I believe him to be a Man of Humanity , and rather than do any thing of this Kind , he would relieve distressed Persons , if it was in his Power ; how this happened I know not . Joseph Rawson . I have known him these thirty Years , and his Father and Mother before him . I have trusted him with a great many Pounds , and with the keeping of my Books : And as I stand before this Tribunal , and must stand before a greater , I do not think he would be guilty of any ill Thing . Bird . My Lord , I rest it here . K. Coun . We should not have troubled your Lordship any further , if this last Part of the Defence , as to Character , had not been made ; but as he has led us into it , I think it proper to call 2 or 3 Witnesses . [ George Colclough called again . ] Q . What is the general Character of the Prisoner ? Colclough . When he is sober , he is very civil to the Prisoners ; but when he is in Liquor , he will swear , and curse , and rattle ; when he is out of Liquor , he is very easy . - He is reckoned unkind with respect to beating them , damning them , and the like . [ Bushel called again . ] Q . What is the Prisoner 's general Character , with Regard to Kindness or Cruelty ? Bushel . His Character is , that he is cruel to his Prisoners . - I speak as to his general Character . Bird . He says my Character is cruel ; I wish he would give the Court one Instance of it . Coun . I am not at Liberty to ask that Question ; but I will not oppose it . Bushel . I have seen you push People headlong down Stairs ; poor People in Liquor . Q . Is that his general Character when he is sober ? Bushel . When he is sober he is hasty , passionate and hot , but he is civil to them upon all Accounts ; but when he is in Liquor , he is barbarous : I would not have spoke it if he had not obliged me to do it . - I b elieve he is oftener drunk than sober . Tilton ( being asked his Character ) . When sober he is courteous , in Liquor barbarous . Thomas Morris . I have known him ever since he came to the Watchhouse . Q . What is his general Character when he is sober ? Morris . Some People say he is good-natured , and some say he is ill-natured . - I know nothing of his general Character , nor of any of his cruel Acts . The Jury withdrew for some Time , and being return 'd , the Foreman gave in their Verdict thus . According to the Law delivered to us we find him Guilty , Death . And afterwards said , The Case is unprecedented to any of us : If there be any room to recommend the Prisoner we desire it . N. B . There were eighteen Witnesses examin 'd last Sessions , on the Indictments against the Prisoner , for the Murder of Mary Maurice , which did not appear upon this Trial : And there are seventeen Witnesses on this Trial , who gave no Evidence at the former . 136 , 137. Thomas Torbett and Margaret Pierce were indicted for the Murder of Patrick Smith , in Chelsea-Fields , August 20 . Elizabeth Smith . I have nothing to say against the Prisoners . - My Husband , Patrick Smith , went out in good Health , on Friday the 20th of August , between two and three in the Afternoon , and on Saturday Morning about six o'Clock , I had Word brought me that he was murdered , and on Saturday Night he was brought Home dead . Anne Quale . On Friday , the 20th of August , Torbett came Home about five o'Clock in the Afternoon ; he was for going out , I would have had him stay at Home , but he would go out ; I said I would follow him ; he said it would be of no Service to me if I did . I supposed he was going to that Woman , the other Prisoner : I followed him in order to prevent it , and went through the Park , as far as Buckingham House ; I kept at a reasonable Distance , that he might not observe me . I did not follow him to prevent his committing Murder , for I did not think he would have done such a Thing . Just by a Stable Yard Gate by the Park I lost them ; I asked a Man whether any such Persons went that Way , and described them ; he said yes , they went by Buckingham-Gate . I saw the two Prisoners , they met a Soldier , and the Soldier turned his Coat ; they all three went together from Buckingham-Gate towards the Turnpike , going to Chelsea , ( the Clock struck nine as I went by Buckingham-Gate ) I saw the Deceased coming along Chelsea-Fields ; I pulled my Cap off , and put it in my Bosom , and put my black Petticoat over my Head , that they might not discover me . Pierce made her Way over to him as fast as she could , ( Torbett and the Soldier stopped in the Road ) and then the Deceased stopped , to the best of my thinking . I thought I saw him put his Hand into her Bosom , whether he put it in or no , I can not say ; as soon as she had stopped him , says Tom Torbett to the Soldier , now let us go . When Tom Torbett came up to her , says he , G - d damn your Eyes , you Bitch , is this your Work ? with that , this Tom Torbett struck the Deceased on the Side of the Head , to the best of my Knowledge ; when he struck him , she said , Follow your Blows , for he has got Money about him . The Man was for going along if they would have let him , but the Soldier and Torbett made him stop , and Torbett took something from the Deceased , and gave it into Peirce 's Hand ; then the Soldier struck him ; as soon as the Soldier struck him , one of the Dogs flew at him ; ( the Deceased had two Dogs with him ) says he , Gentlemen , Have you no Mercy ? Says Torbett to the Soldier , Take Care , the Dog will bite you ; says the Soldier , Damn my Eyes , never mind that . I saw the Soldier clap his Hand to the Deceased 's Breast , and he said , Gentlemen , Do not cut me any more . My Lord , as soon as the Gentleman had said Do not cut me any more , he did not walk so far as this Court is in Length before he fell down ; then I heard the Soldier say , Tom , he is done for . I then thought it my best way to come away . - I saw the Soldier cross the Road , and leave the two Prisoners . I heard Torbett say , I have got his Watch with a Trifle more , and that is all : I let them pass me , and I went Home to Bed . On Saturday Morning , between eight and nine o'Clock my Husband came Home ( as I called him , but I was not married to him , tho ' I lived with him ) I asked him where he had been all Night , says he , I have been in a great many Places . I told him I would get him his Breakfast , he said he had got Money enough to help himself now : I said I was glad of it , and he pulled out 5 s. and three Six-pences ; he threw me down three Six-pences and a Shilling . I asked him what became of the Man that he struck last Night ; he asked me what Man , I told him the Man in Chelsea-Fields . I told him he did not think I followed him , but I did . When he found that I knew of it he could not deny it ; says he , he struck me again , and went away , and I saw no more of him ; he went out and said he did not know whether he should come Home that Night . About twelve o'Clock I heard that a Man was murdered in Chelsea-Fields , and then it came fresh into my Mind , that was the Man that I saw him strike . I met some of his Friends the same Day , and they said they wondered I should suffer him to pawn my Cloaths to buy him a Watch : they said they saw him with a Silver Watch : Then I thought they had killed the Man , but I was willing to conceal it as long as I could , as I had a Love for him ; but hearing some Persons were taken up , and put into the Gatehouse for this Fact , I was under a great deal of Concern , that innocent Persons should suffer for a Crime they were not guilty of . I went to Justice De Veil , and made an Information , and took them both out of their Beds together . - It was a Moon-Light Night . - Mr Bass saw you with the Watch in your Pocket . - I am sure he had the Watch . Torbett . I am married to her , and have a Certificate . Q . Was you ever married to this Man ? Quale . I was a little fuddled one Night , and came to the Fleet . - There were some Words said , but we were not married . I have seen a great many Weddings , and there was a great many Words at them ; we had very few Words , hardly any at all . - There was a Man there , - he appeared very little like a Clergyman . - There was no Ring , - the Clergyman had little or no Money . - Q . So the Clergyman could not go on without Money ? Did the Clergyman come to these Words , Wilt thou have this Man ? Quale . I do not know , - I never was married to him in my Life , nor never went by his Name . - I never saw the Deceased , either before his Death or after . Alexander Read . I found a Wound penetrating the Thorax on the left Side , about five Inches deep , which seemed to be done by a Bayonet . Patrick Owen parted with Smith , the Deceased , the 20th of August , about half an Hour after eight , he had two Dogs with him , his Watch and some Money ; the Body lay in the Field next to where the Bloody-Bridge is , Quale . He was murdered in the Field where he was found ; I am positive of it , - it was the Field next to the bloody Bridge . Caleh Eeles . I keep a Cellar in the Strand ; Quale one Night came into our House , and seeing Torbett with another Woman , charged him with Misbehaviour to her ; angry Words passed , and she struck him with a Pot over his Head ; said , she could not correct his Manners , and was very willing to leave him . Torbett said he would go with the Prisoner , Peirce , if he was sure to go to the Devil , rather than go with her . Joseph Limbrey . The Evidence 's Name is not Quale , her Name is Ann Cokely ; but she goes by a great many Names . I have been in Company with her . - I am bashful coming into such a Place as this ; I am quite bashful . I have not the Impudence a great many have . - I have heard her say , I do not value hanging no more than a Pint of Beer , - not hanging of him ; she said she did not value hanging . She has been a vile Person , and bears a very bad Character ; she is a notorious Thief , and I believe would not value taking any Body 's Life away . Several Persons appeared for Torbett and Peirce , who gave them the Characters of honest Persons , and never knew any Ill of them . Both Acquitted . They were a second Time indicted , for assaulting Patrick Smith , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , val . 40 s. and ten Pounds in Money , August 20 . Widow Smith . I have no Evidence to give , with Respect to the Robbery . Acquitted . 138. Frances Farrel was indicted for stealing a Looking-Glass and a Linnen Sheet , the Property of James Hunt , Sept. 23 . Sarah Hunt . She said she pawned the Glass , and owned before Justice Manley that she had the Things . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 139. Mary Freeman was indicted for stealing 11 Yards of Ribbon , the Goods of John Sage . Henry Deane . Sept. 29 , the Prisoner came into my Master 's Shop , and took this Ribbon ; I saw she had it before she went out of the Shop ; I let her go out of the Shop , and fetched her back , and she gave me the Ribbon again . George Greenhill Jones . - I saw Mr Deane bring her back , and saw her throw the Ribbon down upon the Counter . Abbot , Brunskell , Forsyth and Carter gave her the Character of an honest Woman . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 140 , 141. Bartholomew Harper and Richard West , of Stanwell , were indicted for stealing four Sheep Skins , value 7 s. the Goods of Henry Bullock , Oct. 9 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 142. Jane Barber , of St Botolph 's , Bishopsgate , was indicted for assaulting John Crolee on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , value 40 s. and 2 s. in Money . John Crolee . Sept. 4 , about 7 o'Clock in the Evening , at the End of Houndsditch , the Prisoner asked me to give her a Dram ; she had two or three more Creatures with her : Thinks I , I had better give this Creature a Dram , than be troubled with her . We went into Magpye-Alley : As soon as the Dram was called for , I paid for it , came away , and left her , and went down Devonshire-street ; there she stopt me again : When I came into Sandwich-Court , she seized me round the Neck , and hugged me , and at that Time picked my Pocket of two Shillings and some Half-pence , and she demanded the Watch out of my Hand : I told her she should not have it , for it was not mine : Says I , Madam , you will not have the Watch , by G - d : But , by G - d , says she , I will . She catched hold of the Watch , snatched it from me , broke a strong Cat-gut , and I fell backwards upon my A - e. I went back to the House where I had the Dram , the Man goes by the Name of Old Dad , and told him ; he said , he knew nothing of it , it was nothing to him . I stood in the Street till twelve o'Clock , and by the Help of Mr. Stout , she was taken up . I am sure the Prisoner is the Person . William Stout . I saw the Prosecutor in the Street about twelve o'Clock : He told me he had lost his Watch , and by several Circumstances I thought it was the Prisoner that had it : We went to Old Dad Welch , and he asked him , if he could help him to a Guinea , at last he said half a Guinea , to help him to his Watch . The Prosecutor said , he could not . We took him up , carried him to the Watch-house , and afterwards to the Compter . The Prisoner has said since , she wished she had not returned the Watch . Prisoner . It is only Spight in this William Stout , for he is as likely to take it as any Body ; and that Man ( the Prosecutor ) does not know who to swear it to , any more than the Child in his Mother 's Womb . He was very much in Liquor . Han . Welch . He charged Nan Brown with it : This Man was asleep upon a Stall three Hours . - I never saw him to know his Face . Q . How then can you tell that he was the Man that was asleep upon the Balle ? Welch . Only by the Cloath he had on . Mary Stout . This Prosecution is all out of Malice . Anne Thomas gave her the Character of a very honest Girl . Han . Welch , jun . I was coming down Sandwich-Court between six and seven o'Clock on Saturday Night , about five Weeks ago , and met the Gentleman who accuses this Woman with this Robbery , and he would have used me barbarously , if it had not been for a Man that was coming along . - You are the Man ; you had a light-coloured Coat on , and a Sort of an Apron ; I will take my Oath of it . - He took hold of me , and called me very unhandsome Names , and said , I had robbed him of his Watch . He slapp 'd my Face , and gave me 2 or 3 unhandsome Kicks . Mary Glode confirmed the Evidence of the last Witness , and said he would have used her so , if she had not got away . Guilty of the Felony , acquitted of the Putting in Fear . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 143. Anne Measham was indicted for stealing a Purse , value 6 d. a Seal , value 1 s. one Piece of Gold , value 5 s. 9 d. and seventy Guineas , the Property of Bryan Mathews , - privately from his Person , Sept. 28 . Bryan Mathews . Sept. 28 , as I was coming along on this Side of Ludgate , a Woman called to me , and took me into the Prisoner 's House , in a back Alley , to drink a Dram , and they dramm 'd me till I was quite drunk ; and I was turned out about five o'Clock in the Morning . - I went in about five or six at Night . I was a little merry when I went in , but not drunk : I was pretty sensible when I came into the Street , and in about an Hour afterwards I missed my Money . I suppose I was fast asleep when they robbed me , or I should not have suffered them to do it . Measham . Let him look at my Face , and see if he ever saw me in his Life . Mathews . I am sure she is the very Woman who sold the Drams . John Gardiner , Constable . I was going my Rounds with my Watchman about one o'Clock , and going down Vandelow's-Alley , it is on Ludgate hill , one Part comes to Fleet ditch . I saw the Prisoner lie upon the Ground , so drunk that she could not stand : Being informed she had dropped some Money , I asked her if it was her 's ; she owned that she had dropped thirty Guineas , and two half Guineas , and some small Matters beside : She said it was her Money , and made a De of it . Says I , it is necessary , as you keep a orderly House , to go before a Magistrate , to know how you came by this Money . I had her Alderman Arnold , - it was Michaelmas Day She was in several Stories , so he committed to the Compter : By his Direction I advertised it and the next Day Bryan Mathews came to me , and said he had lost 71 Guineas , & c . - Thomas . About half an Hour after one o'Clock , I saw a Coach stop ; and as she was coming out of the Coach , I saw the Money drop from the Prisoner at the Bar . - Holdway , the Porter , took it up : I followed him to Wat Lane , Black-Fryars , and saw the Purse there afterwards . - Holdway . I saw this Woman and another , drunk in a Coach , and as they were taking her out , I saw this Money , Purse and Seal , drop down from the Prisoner at the Bar , and I took it up immediately : There are thirty Guineas , two half Guineas , eight Shillings , and Eight-pence Half-penny . Mathews . This is my Purse , and this is my Seal . I lost seventy-one Guineas , a quarter Carolus , and a Seal . Guilty of the Felony . [ Transportation .
