The two Indicted as Accessaries were acquitted . Elenor Adams , Indicted for Murthering her Bastard Child .

She in her Defence alledged , That she and her Father-in-law having lodged about six Months at Brandford , and it being known she was with Child , they forced her out of Doors ; that with cold , and want of conveniencies , the Child was still born ; that she was delivered in the Boat , tho concealed from the Watermen ; and that she had a Husband , but at Sea . Her Father-in-law endeavouring to give some Evidence in her favour , did it so as that just suspition was he had been the Father of the said Bastard ; which suspition was confirmed by evidence of his extraordinary kindness to his Daughter more than to his Wife ; with other circumstances .
