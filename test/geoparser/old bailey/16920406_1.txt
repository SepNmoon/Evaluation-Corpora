LONDON , Printed by Thomas Braddyll , and are to be Sold by William Battersby at Thavies-Inn-Gate , and R. Baldwin near the Oxford-Arms in Warwick-lane , MDCXCII . TO THE READER . THE Murther of Doctor Andrew Clenche ( from the manner of it ) did very much disturb the Thoughts of many Men . But the Evidence against Henry Harrison , Gent . at his Tryal for that Murther , was so full and satisfactory to all that heard it , That it was then believed there was not any doubt left of his being one of the Actors of that Murther . But there having been some Endeavours since by the Accusation of one John Cole , and others , to make the said Henry Harrison appear Innocent , and to Arraign the Justice of the Kingdom . It is therefore thought necessary to publish both the Trials of the said Henry Harrison and John Cole , for the Satisfaction of all Persons , and in hopes also , that it may be a means of as happy a Discovery of the Managers of that Accusation , as there was by great Providence of one of the Actors of that secret and cruel Murther . THE Arraignment , Tryal , Conviction and Condemnation of Henry Harrison , Gent . FOR THE MURTHER OF Dr. Andrew Clenche . Die Mercurii Sexto die Aprilis , Anno Regni Domini Gulielmi & Dominae Mariae Regis & Reginoe , Anglioe , & c. Quarto . Judges Present Lord Chief-Justice Holt , Lord Chief-Baron Atkins , Mr Justice Nevil . THE Keeper of the Prison of Newgate did , according to Order of the Court being then sate , bring up the Body of Henry Harrison , Gent . to the Sessions-House in the Old-Baily , London , who being at the Bar , was Arraigned upon an Indictment of Felony and Murther , found that Day by the Grand-Jury for the City of London , in manner following : Clerk of Arraignment . HEnry Harrison , hold up thy Hand [ Which he did ] You stand Indicted by the Name of Henry Harrison , late of London , Gent . for that you not having the fear of God before your Eyes , but being mov 'd and seduc 'd by the Instigation of the Devil , the Fourth Day of January , in the Third Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord and Lady , King William and Queen Mary , of England , & c. about Eleven of the Clock in the Night of the same Day , with Force and Arms , & c. at London , viz . in the Parish of St Peter Cornhill , in the Ward of Limestreet in Londonaforesaid , being in a certain Coach with one Andrew Clenche Doctor of Physick , and a certain Man yet unknown , in and upon the said Andrew Clenche in the Peace of God , and of our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen , then and there being Violently , Feloniously and of your Malice before-thought , did make an Assault . And that you the said Henry Harrison , with the Help and Assistance of the said Man unknown , with a Pocket Handkerchief with a Coal in the same , being put , of the value of Two Pence , about the Neck of him the said Andrew Clenche , then and there Feloniously , Voluntarily and of your Malice before-thought did put , fasten and bind ; and that you the said Henry Harrison with the said Handkerchief with the Coal aforesaid in it , by you the said Henry Harrison with the Help and Assistance of the aforesaid Man unknown about the Neck of the said Andrew Clenche then as aforesaid , put , fastened and bound him the said Andrew Clenche then and there with Force and Arms , & c. Feloniously , Voluntarily and of your Malice before-thought did choak and strangle , by Reason of which choaking and strangling of the said Andrew Clenche by you the said Henry Harrison , with the Handkerchief aforesaid , with the Coal as aforesaid put in it , he the said Andrew Clenche instantly died : So that you the said Henry Harrison with the Help and Assistance of the said Man unknown , him the said Andrew Clenche the said Fourth Day of January in the Year aforesaid at the Parish and Ward aforesaid in manner and form aforesaid , Feloniously , Voluntarily and of your Malice before-thought did Kill and Murther against the Peace of our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen now , their Crown and Dignity . How say you , Henry Harrison , are you Guilty of this Felony and Murther whereof you stand Indicted , or not Guilty ? Mr Harrison . Not Guilty in Thought , Word not Deed . Cl . of Ar . Culpriest , How will you be Tryed ? Mr Harrison . By God and my Country . Cl . of Ar . God send you a good Deliverance . Then the said Mr Harrison was taken away from the Bar by the Keeper of Newgate . And afterwards the same Day , about Eleven of the Clock in the Morning , the said Henry Harrison was brought to the Bar , and he desired the Court that he might then be Tryed , which was granted , and those Persons who were return 'd upon the Jury were called over twice , and their Appearances recorded . Cl . of Ar . You Henry Harrison , These Men that you shall hear call 'd , and personally do appear , are to pass between our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen , and you upon Tryal of your Life and Death ; if therefore you will challenge them , or any of them , your time is to challenge them as they come to the Book to be Sworn , and before they be Sworn . L. C. J. Holt . Mr Harrison , you may challenge such of the Jury as you shall think fit before they be Sworn . Then the Jury was called and sworn , and then were counted ; and the Twelve sworn were these whose Names follow : JURORS : John Roll Nathaniel Houlton Michael Pindar James Hulbere Joseph Howe Richard Chewne Sworn . John Lawford Nicholas Wildeboare Robert Williamson William Merriden Thomas Simpson Thomas Pakeman Sworn . Then Proclamation for Information and Evidence was made as is usual . Mr Harrison , My Lord , I have made no Challenges , because I do believe the Jury to be honest Men . Cl . of Arr . - Henry Hurrison , Hold up thy Hand . [ which he did . ] Gentlemen , you that are sworn , look upon the Prisoner , and hearken to his Cause . He stands indicted by the Name of Henry Harrison , late of London , Gent . & c. [ he reads the Indictment . ] Upon this Indictment he hath been Arraigned , and thereunto hath pleaded not Guilty ; and for his Tryal hath put himself upon God and his Country , which Country you are . Your Charge is to enquire whether he be Guilty of this Felony and Murther wherof he stands Indicted , or not Guilty . If you find that he is Guilty , you are to enquire what Goods or Chattels , Lands or Tenements he had at the time of the Felony and Murther committed , or at any time since . If you find him not Guilty , you are to enquire whether he fled for it . If you find that he fled for it , you are to enquire of his Goods and Chattels , as if you found him Guilty . If you find him not Guilty ; nor that he did fly for it , you are to say so , and no more ; and hear your Evidence . Mr Darnell , - My Lords , Mr Harrison 's Agents or Friends have since the last Sessions , made or conveyed away a young Man that was a Principal Evidence against him . L. C. J . That is a very ill thing , and if it be prov 'd , it will no way conduce to Mr Harrison 's Advantage . Mr Harrison , My Lord , I know nothing of it . But my Lord , one of my Witnesses that would have been material for me , is lately dead , Sir Edward Hungersord 's Son . Mr Darnell , May it please your Lordships , and you Gentlemen that are sworn , I am of Councel for the King and Queen against the Prisoner at the Barr , who stands Indicted for the Murther of Dr Andrew Clenche , which was as barbarous a Murther as any that hath been committed in this Age . And considering it was done in the Dark , I think there will be given as clear an Evidence of it against Mr Harrison the Prisoner , as can be expected . And that it was uponthis occasion one Mrs Vanwicke a Widdow ( between whom and Mr Harrison there was a great Kindness ) prevailed with Dr Clenche , to whom she was indebted twenty Pounds , to lend her so much more as would make it up one hundred and twenty Pounds , and to take a Mortgage of a House of hers in Buckingham Court near Charing-Cross for his Security ; and Mr Harrison was present with Mrs Vanwicke at the lending of the rest of the Money , and executing of the Mortgage , as he was wont to be at the Management of her Affairs ; but when the time came that it was to be repaid , the Dr could not get his Money , and Mrs Vanwicke having but an Estate for Life in the House , and having long delayed the Doctor , he brought an Ejectment for the recovering of the House , upon which the Prisoner came to Dr Clenche , and abused him with very scurrilous Language , and his Passion growing higher , he laid his hand upon his ord , and would have drawn it , and if it had not been for one Mr Johnson , 't was thought he would have kill 'd the Doctor at that time ; so that the Doctor desired Mr Johnson to take the business upon himself , and to act in his own Name , he was so much afraid of him . And it will be proved further to you , that at another time the Prisoner said , That Dr Clenche was a Rogue and a Villain , and deserved to have his Throat cut . And sometime after this Mrs Vanwicke would have borrowed some more Money of the Doctor , but he refused to lend it her , whereupon she acquainting the Prisoner with it , he said , leave him to me ( Madam ) I 'll warrant you , I 'll manage him , he is a Rogue , and deserves to have his Throat cut . And afterwards about St Thomas 's day last , the Prisoner went to Mrs West the Tennant , who dwelt in the House mortgaged to Dr Clenche , and desired of Mrs West to have some Money for Mrs Vanwicke , and said it should be discounted in part of the then next Christmas Rent . But the said Mrs West refused to pay him any , telling him that she and her Husband were forbid by Dr Clenche and the Ground Land-Lord , to pay any more to Mrs Vanwicke , and thereupon the Prisoner expressed his further Malice against the Doctor , and said he is a great Rogue , and a Villain , and deserves to have his Throat cut , and will not dye in his Bed . And , Gentlemen , soon after the Prisoner began to put his malicious Design against the Doctor in Execution , and the Method he took was first to change his Lodgings , for on the day before Christmas Eve last , he took new Lodgings at one Mr Garways in Thread-Needle-street , near the Old Exchange , attended by a Foot-boy , pretending himself to be a Parliament Man , and that he was just then come out of the Country , and lay in his Lodging there every Night , until the first day of January following , but lay out that Night , and the two next Nights following . And whilst he lodged at this Mr. Garways this matter hapned , which does conduce somewhat towards the discovery of this Murther . One Evening the Prisoner being in his Chamber there , and one Mrs Jackson , the Daughter of Mrs Garway , making a Fire for him , he did take out his Handkerchief , and held it before the Fire to dry it , which she took great notice of , because it was course and dirty , and not fit for his Quality ( as she thought ) it being made of ordinary Indian stuff , like her Mothers MaidsApron . And , Gentlemen , this very Handkerchief was the same with which the Murther was committed , and this Mrs Jackson will swear it to be the same , for it is a very remarkable one , and it will be produced to you . And we shall shew you further , that on the Third Day of January ( being the Day before this Murther was committed . ) he caused a sham Letter to be left for him at his Lodgings at this Mr Garway 's , as written from a Friend of his that was Sick in the Country , carnestly pressing him to come quickly down to him : And we shall prove that the very same Evening he being with Mrs Vanwick in Woodstreet-Counter , did again threaten Dr Clenohe , and said that he was a Rogue , and he would have his Blood . And upon the Fourth Day of January last he again changed his Lodgings , and took new ones at one Mr. Jones 's a Cane-Chair-maker in St Paul 's Church-yard , and there he pretended himself to be a Country Gentleman , just then come out of Cumberland , and brought in a Portmantoau Trunk thither . And the same Day he sent a Letter to Mrs Garway where he had lodged before , acquainting her that he was gone out of Town for a Week or ten Days . And , to give you farther Satisfaction , we shall prove that upon the same Fourth Day of January in the Night of which this unfortunate Gentleman was Murther 'd , the Prisoner was at one Mr. Robert Humston 's Lodgings at the Golden-Key in Fleet-street over against , Fetter-lane End , at near Nine of the Clock at Night , and being ask 'd by Mr Humston to stay and Sup with him , he said he could not , for he had been about carnest Business that Day , which was to be done that Night , and that a Gentleman stayed for him in the Street to go with him about it , and so he went away . And soon after , about Nine of the Clock the same Night , two Men standing in Fleetstreet at Fetterlane End , call 'd for a Coach , and ask 'd the Coachman if he knew Dr Clenche who dwelt in Brownlow-street in Holborn ; and the Coachman reply 'd , he did know the Street , but not the Doctor , whereupon they went into the Coach , and ordered him to drive to the End of Brownlowstreet , and when they came thither , one of them called to the Coachman and bad him go to Dr Clenche 's and tell him , that two Gentlemen in a Coach at the End of the Street desired him to go with them to a Patient that was very Sick , which the Coachman did . And he found the Doctor in his Night-Gown and Slippers , and just a going to Bed ; but he immediately dressed himself , and went to them into the Coach . And it fell out very happily for the further Discovery of this Murther , that while this Coach stood at the End of Brownlowstreet , a Young Gentlewoman standing at her own Door near it , and fancying that while the Coachman went on the Errand , the Gentlemen would slip out of the Coach ( I think they call it Bilking ) she watch 'd them . And a Lamp that lighted cross Holborn over against Brownlowstreet End , and another about the middle of Brownlowstreet , gave such a light into the Coach , that she plainly saw one of the Men that sate in it , and see him look out of the Coach after the Coachman , and heard him swear at the Coachman , because he made no more haste in going to the Doctor 's House , and she is very certain that the Prisoner at the Bar is the same Person that look 'd out of the Coach , and that didswear on the Coachman , and is more confident of it from the remarkableness of his Voice For she hearing of this Murther and remembring these Circumstances , she went to Newgate to see the Prisoner , and hearing his Voice in another Room , before she saw him ; she declar 'd to the Persons that were then with her that the Voice she then heard was the Persons Voice that she saw look out of the Coach , and that did swear at the Coachman ; and afterwards when she came into the Room where the Prisoner was , though with several other Men , she pointed to him as the Person , and she hearing him then speak again , declared to the Persons with her , that both by his Voice and by his Countenance she knew him to be the same Man . And , my Lord , after those Gentlemen had gotten the Doctor into the Coach , one of them called to the Coachman , and bad him make haste and drive them to Leaden-Hall Market , and when they were come within Holbourn-Bars one of them called to the Coachman and bad him drive faster whereupon the Coachman drove them very fast through Holbourn to Leaden-Hall-Market-Gate , and when he came there , one of them had him drive to the Pye without Aldgate . ( before which time , without doubt , the Murther was committed upon the Doctor , for his Har was found next morning in Holborn near Fetter-lane End , but the driving so long about after is supposed to be done least the Doctor might recover ) and when they were come without Aldgate , one of them ordered the Coachman to ask there for one Hunt a Chyrurgeon ; which he did , and being answered that no such Person was there , he ordered the Coachman to drive back again to Leaden-Hall , and when they came there , one of them called the Coachman and gave him , Three Shillings and Six Pence , and bad him go into the Market there to one Hunt 's a Poulterer , and buy them a couple of Fowls , but the Coachman could not find any Hunt a Poulterer , but however he bought a couple of Fowls for Three Shillings , and when he came with them to his Coach , the two Gentlemen were gone and the Doctor left in the Coach murther 'd with a Handkerchief tied fast about his Neck with a Coal in it ( which will be proved to be the Prisoners Handkerchief . ) Besides there was , a Boy in the Street there who took notice of the Coachman 's being sent of an Errand , and saw the two Persons come out of the Coach in great haste , and she going towards the Coach before they went out of it , one of them did swear at him to be gone , and of him the Boy took most notice , and was as possitive as any man can be to the Person of one that he never saw before , that the Prisoner now at the Bar was one of them , and was the Person that did then swear at him . But this Witness is spirited away and can not be heard of , although he hath been described in the Gazettee , and diligent search and inquiry has been made after him . But we have his Examination upon Oath before the Coroner ; and we must submit to the Court how far that shall be admitted as Evidence . Gentlemen , We will call our Witnesses , and if they prove all this matter , I believe every Man here will be satisfied that the Prisoner at the Bar is Guilty of this base murther . Mr Darnell . Pray call and swear Mr George Wigmore . [ who was sworn with others . Mr Darnell , Pray Mr. Wigmore tell my Lord and the Jury what you know of any Money that was lent by Dr Clenche , and to whom . Mr George Wigmore , May it please your Lordship , there was a draught of a Mortgage from Mrs Vanwicke to Dr Clenche , made by a Gentleman of Grays-Inn for the Sum of One hundred and twenty Pounds , and I Ingross 'd in ; and I paid by the Doctors Order above Threescore Pounds of the Money , and the rest of it was satisfied before ; and upon sealing of the Mortgage for the Money , Mr Harrison , and one Mr Rowe fell out about their Dividend of the Money , and called one another ill Names ; and Mr Rowe produced a Bill of what he had done and laid out for Coach-hire and other things for Mrs Vanwicke , and Mr Harrison and he had high words about it , and called one another Rogues ; so I told them if they could not agree , I would put the Money up again , and carry it home ; but Mrs Vanwicke and they did agree at last , and sealed the Mortgage , and I paid the Money ; and Mrs Vanwicke and Mr Harrison took out twenty Pounds of the Money , and paid it to Mr Rowe ; and after Mr Rowe was gone , they desired me to go with them to the Young Devil Tavern , and they both used hard Expressions there against Mr Rowe . L. C. J . Who was the Mortgage made to ? Mr Wigmore , My Lord , it was made to Dr Clenche for one hundred and twenty Pounds . Mr Harrison , Pray Sir will you tell the Jury how much Money the Gentlewoman had , and if Mr. Row had not stept between me and her , I had not been in Question . Mr Wigmore , Mrs Vanwicke acknowledged that the Money I paid her , made up one hundred and twenty Pounds . L. C. J . What did you hear the Prisoner say against Dr Clenche ? Mr Wigmore ; My Lord , I do say that he was very troublesome to the Doctor . L. C. J . Were there any Reproaches cast upon the Doctor at that time ? Mr Wigmore , No my Lord , only upon Rowe , because he was a Trustee . Mr Darnell , Did you hear him say any thing against the Doctor ? Mr Wigmore , Indeed I can not particularly say . L. C. J . He is upon his Oath , and he is sensible and understands the Question . Mr. Wigmore . He did say very ugly Words , and when I met him afterwards in the High-way , he was very hussy , and I thought he would have drawn his Sword upon me . L. C. J . What did he say of the Doctor ? Mr Wigmore , I can not say particularly what he said . L. C. J . Stand down . Mr Darnell , Call Mr Thomas Johnson [ who was sworn and stood up . ] Mr Darnell , Sir , Pray give the Court an Account what you know concerning this Matter . Mr Johnson , My Lord , I believe I shall say nothing that Mr Harrison will contradict , I was Attorny for Dr Clenche between him and Mrs Vanwicke , and I sued Mr Rowe that was bound with Mrs Vanwickein a Bond to perform Covenants for re-payment of the Money lent her by Dr Clenche upon Mortgage ; and I advised the Dr. and told him , do n't let us trouble the Tenant , but let us take Rowe first ; and I sued Rowe , and had him arrested , and after some time , I saw that the Mortgage must do our business , for Rowe could not pay the Money , whereupon I caused a Declaration in Ejectment to be delivered against Mrs Vanwick 's Tenant of the House Mortgaged by her to Dr Clenche , and then Mr Harrison came to me , and he expressed himself against the Dr after a strange rate , and laid his Hand upon his Sword , so my Lord I said to him , what a Fool do you make of your self ? must none go to Law , but they must ask you leave , I suppose Mr Harrison can not deny this . Then Mr Harrison preferred a Petition to the Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal for Mrs Vanwicke , and thereby suggested to their Lordships that she was wronged in the Purchase and in the Mortgage Money , and that twenty Pounds of it was a former debt of her Husbands ; and he finding she could have no Relief before them without payment of the Mortgage Money , he grew troublesome ; yet says I , Mr Harrison , What she hath done , I can not help , but if she would pay the rest , I told him I would abate her twenty Pounds , and the Interest Money also . Mr Darnell , Pray Sir , did the Dr desire you to act for him in your own Name , because he had no mind to meet with Mrs Vanwicke and the Prisoner ? Mr Johnson , The Doctor did find himself too deeply concerned with them , and he did not care to have to do with them , whether it was that he was afraid of his Life , I can not say ; but he said to me , Pray Sir , go on , I will put all into your hands , and I will trust you with all the Affair , and let them come to you , and not trouble me , own it to be your own ; and I told him , I feared none of them , and the Doctor gave out that he had made over all to me , although he had not , and upon this I fear , comes this unfortunate Business , and the Doctor 's Lady must look after it her self . L. C. J . What did he say when he had laid his Hand upon his Sword in your Study . Mr Johnson , He said the Dr. had cheated the Widdow , and he said that he would be revenged on him , as near as my Memory will serve me , I suppose he will not deny it ; whether he did this in a Passion , or to affright the Doctor or no , I can not tell . L. C. J . Was that before you offered to abate the twenty Pounds ? Mr Johnson , It was before I offered to abate it . Mr Harrison , How long was it before Dr Clenche was murthred ? Mr Johnson , I think it was about a Fortnight or three Weeks , or a little more . Mr Harrison , I never threatned the Doctor in my Life , but I said Rowe had been a Villain and a Cheat , and he and Rowe were the Men , and I shall make it appear that the Dr never wrong 'd the Widdow . L. C. J . How came Rowe to be intrusted or concerned with the Money ? Mr Johnson , My Lord , Mr Cornelius Vandinanker , a Merchant , gave a Legacy of five hundred Pounds to the Widdow Vanwicke and her Children , and Mr Rowe was a Trustee on the Purchase , and had by that the management of the Affair . Mr. Darnell . Call Mr. George Howard . ( Who being Sworn stood up . Mr. Darnell . Mr. Howard , Give the Court an Account of what you know concerning the Prisoner 's threatning Dr. Clenche . Mr. Howard . My Lord , I was at Joe 's Coffee-house near Warwick-House in Holborn , some considerable time before Dr. Clenche was Murdred , where Mr. Harrison used several very virulent Expressions against Dr. Clenche ; amongst others , one was , That he was a Rogue and a Rascal , and deserved to have his Throat Cut . Mrs. Vanwick was then in Company , and they both said , That they then came from Dr. Clenche 's . Mr. Darnell . You are sure he said that Dr. Clenche deserved to have his Throat Cut . Mr. Howard . Yes : He said , That Dr. Clenche deserved to have his Throat Cut . Mr. Harrison . Who was I talking to ? Mr. Howard You were talking to Mrs. Mary Sheriff . Mr. Darnell . Call Mrs. Mary Sheriff . ( Who was Sworn , and stood up . Mrs. Sheriff . My Lord , Mrs. Vanwick came to my House with Mr. Harrison , and desired me to go with her to Dr. Clenche his House ; and when we came there , she desired him to let her have Twenty Pounds more ; and he said , No . If his House were full of Money , he would not lend her any more , so long as she kept Mr. Harrison Company , for he would spend it ; and he advised her to be a Gentleman 's House-keeper , and he would help her to a Place ; and told her withal , That she owed him , One Hundred and Twenty Pounds , for which he would take One Hundred Pounds ; and we left Mr. Harrison behind us at my House , and did not take him with us , because we were afraid he might anger the Doctor , and fall out with him ; so when we came back , Mr. Harrison asked Mrs. Vanwick , what Dr. Clenche said ; Why , says she , he faith , That he will not lend me any more Money while I keep you Company , for you will spend it , and that I must go to Service . To Service ! said Mr. Harrison . God damne him , have a Person of your Quality go to Service ! he deserves to have his Throat Cut ; let me alone ; I 'll manage him as never any Man was managed , and so away they went together . Mr. Harrison . Did not you say , that as you hop 'd to be sav 'd , that I was Innocent of the Thing ? L. C. J . She does not Accuse you of doing the Fact , but gives an Account of some Expressions that passed from you . Mrs. Sheriff . You were always talking against Dr Clenche , and you said , God damne him , he was an Old Rogue , and that Mrs. Vanwick was almost Starved to Death . Mr. Harrison . Rowe , Rowe , I meant , my Lord . ( The Prisoner being them in a Passion . L. C. J. Mr. Harrison , do not fall into a Passion , it may be more to your Advantage , in the making your Defence , if you keep your Temper . L. C. J . Witness , What were the Words that he said against Doctor Clenche ? Mrs. Sheriff . Why , he speaking of Doctor Clenche , said to Mrs. Vanwick , God damne him , would he have a Person of your Quality go to Service ! he deserves to have his Throat Cut ; well , Madam , says he , be contented I 'll manage him as never any Man was managed . Mr. Harrison . What had you for your Swearing ? Coroner for the King and Queen . Witness , he asketh you , if you had any thing for your Swearing against him . Mrs. Sheriff . No , I had nothing , neither have I need of any thing ; I had not so much as my Coach-hire . Mr. Darnell . Call Mrs. Elizabeth West . ( Who was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Mistress , give an Account to the Court , what you know about the Prisoner 's coming to demand Rent of you , and what passed . Mrs. West . May it please your Lordship , this Gentleman , the Prisoner , came to me two or three Days before St. Thomas his Day last , and desired me to give him some Rent for Mrs. Vanwick , and I told him , I had no Power to Pay him , because I was warned by Dr. Clenche , to Pay no more ; says he to me again , Dr. Clenche , and Rowe , are great Rogues and great Villains . Sir , says I to him again , I believe that the Doctor is a very honest Man : No , says Mr. Harrison , he is a great Villain , and he will never Die in his Bed ; which of them he meant , Mr. Rowe or Dr. Clenche , I can not tell . And Mrs. Vanwick , and Mr. Harrison , a little time before that , pressed me , to letthem have some Shop Goods in part of her Rent , to grow due , and she made great Complaint , that her Children were ready to Starve , and I then told them , that Mr. Johnson had fore-warned me to pay any more Rent to Mrs. Vanwick , and if I did , I should pay it again ; and therefore I would not pay any more Rent to her , or deliver her any Goods , until she had agreed with Mr. Johnson , and then Mr. Harrison said , that Mr. Johnson was a great Villain , and a great Rogue , and that they had all Combined together to Cheat the Widow . And Mr. Johnson being at my House , Mrs. Vanwick fell upon him in a great Rage , and said , she would Tear his Throat out , and laid hold on him , and Mr. Johnson got from her , and went away in great haste . And the last time I saw Dr. Clenche , I pressed very hard upon him , to let Mrs. Vanwick have more Money ; and the Doctor said , that she would never do any good with it , for she spent it all upon Mr. Harrison ; and I wished him to let her have Twenty Pounds more , and he said , that he advised her to go to Service , and that he had wished her to a Service of Twenty Pounds a Year , and she abused him for it . L. C. J . What Cloathes had the Prisoner on ? Mrs. West . My Lord , he had an Old Thread-bare black Cloth Suit of Cloaths on , which looked very shabby . Mr. Harrison . What Religion are you of , Mistress ? Mrs. West . I was born and bred up a Protostant . Mr. Harrison : I believe you are a Papist , and will Swear any thing , you keep Roman Catholicks in your House , they have Murdred Dr. Clenche , for ought I know . L. C. J . Did Mr. Harrison ever Lodge in your House ? Mrs. West . No , my Lord , I have none but Persons of Quality Lodge in my House and they belong to the present Government . Mr. Darnell . Call Anne Watson . ( Who was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Pray , tell my Lord and the Jury , what you know of Mr. Harrison 's taking of Lodgings at Mr. Garway 's House , and when it was . Anne Watson . He came about Six a Clock at Night , the Day before Christmas Eve last , to my Master 's , Mr. Garway 's House , and told us , that he was newly come out of the Country ; and Lodged there that Night , and so he did until , and upon the last Night of December ; and on the first Day of January , he went out and staid out that Night ; and on the Sunday , the third of January last , at Night , he came again with a Person with him , and fetch 'd away his Portmanteau-Trunk and things , and paid for his Lodging ; and in his absence , there was a Letter left for him , which I gave him , and he said , it came out of the Country , and that he had a Friend sick in the Country , and did intend to go down to see him , being one from whom he expected a Legacy , and he left that Letter on the Kitchin Window , and on the Monday after , being the fourth Day of January last , he sent a Letter , signifying he was gone out of Town .

He went away the first of January last , about Nine a Clock in the Morning , and returned not that Night , but on the second of January last , he was at my Mistress 's Shop again ( as my Mistress told me ) and he came about five a Clock on the next Sunday Night ( being the third of January last ) with a Person with him , to my Master 's House , and fetch 'd away his Portmanteau-Trunk and Things , and left Three Half Crowns with me for his Lodgings , which I gave to my Mistress . Mr. Darnell . Call Mrs. Catharine Jackson . ( Who was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Pray , tell , my Lord and the Jury , what you know concerning Mr. Harrison 's coming to Lodge at Mr. Garway 's , and when he went away , and what you know of any Handkerchief he had . Mrs. Jackson . He came on the Day before Christmas-Eve , to Lodge at my Father 's , Mr. Garway 's House , and Lodged there several Nights , and went away the third of January at Night , with his Things , but was absent some Nights between his coming and going away , and whilest he Lodged there , I observed a Handkerchief in his Hand , as I was making a Fire for him in his Chamber , and the more , because he had said , he was a Parliament-Man , and I thought it more like a Sea-Man 's Handkerchief , than a Parliament-Man 's , and our Maid had an Apron of the same kind of Stuff . ( Then the Handkerchief was produced in Court , by the Coroner , and the Coal in it , wherewith Dr. Clenche was Strangled . Mr. Darnell . Mrs. Jackson , I desire that you would look upon that Handkerchief , and tell the Court what you know of it . Mrs. Jackson . This is the Handkerchief that I saw Mr. Harrison hold to the Fire , when I was making of it in his Chamber , or very like that Handkerchief , for I observed it to be very like my Mother 's Maid 's Apron .
