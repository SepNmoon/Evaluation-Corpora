THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE SESSIONS At the Old-Baily , August the 27th and 28th , 1679 . CONTAINING The Several Tryals of a great number of notorious Malefactors , AND particularly Of PETER du VAL & THO . THOMPSON , Condemned for Murder : And all other remarkable Occurrences there . With the true Number , Names , & respective Crimes of all that received Sentence of Death , were Burnt in the Hand ; together with Six and thirty to be Transported . This Sessions beginning at the Old baily on Wednesday the 27th of this instant August , the first remarkable Tryal was of Peter Duval , formerly keeping a Tobacco and Strong-water-shop neer St. Giles 's in the Fields , and Tompson a Taylor his Companion , who having left , or rather out-run their Trades , were lately turn 'd Bullies : and having , according to the fashion of such people , associated themselves with two Baggages of the other Sex , going to take a walk , as they pretended , to Marybone , about ten or eleven a Clock in the Evening happened in So-hoe-fields to come up to a parcel of honest [ Text unreadable in original . ] men , who after their labour were refreshing themselves with a pot of Drink , and innocently sitting together at the door of an Ale-house ; when they came near , Duval took upon him to examine them , asking Who was there ? To which being answered , Honest men , he persisted to inquire if they were the Watch ; and they saying they were not , he replied , then you are Rogues : Upon which one Jenkins , somewhat scurrilously , return 'd a foolish ill-bred Phrase , Mine Ar - upon you . This so heated Duval , that he began to swear he had a mind to cut them all to pieces , and that they deserved it for affronting a Gentleman , and to make good his words , drew his Sword , but by the mediation of one of the Company , a lame man , who happened to know him , he put it up again , and delivered it to the woman he led , and went away some small distance ; but swearing terribly all the while , and presently in a fury return 'd , offering to fight with any of them , and while he was a quarrelling with them , Tompson , Duval 's Comrade , drew his Sword , and made at the other men ; and the said Jenkins seeing him coming , and the lame man to be in danger , caught away his Crutch to keep off the Sword , but Tompson following his passes after Jenkins , who retreated , and by the unevenness of the ground fell down , he run him into the Belly , whereof he immediately died . So that they both being concern 'd in the Quarrel , and Duval aiding and abetting the Murder , and no Weapon drawn or blow struck by the other Party , they were both found guilty of the Murther , and their two women who came in as Witnesses to excuse them , being persons of Ill-fame , were Committed . [ Death . See summary . ] Two men , one of them an House-keeper in London hard by the Church at London-stone , were found guilty of stealing between four and five hundred weight of Lead off from the said Church ; to which his horse was so near , that by laying a Board from his window they could easily get upon the roof of the Church , where this Lead lay in sheets roll 'd up ready for use ; but the noise being heard by some of the Watch , they were taken in the manner , and some of the Lead found in his house . There was another young fellow a Shoemaker indicted with them , but he appearing to have been drawn in by the others , and that he had always heretofore behaved himself honestly , he was Acquitted . [ Branding . See summary . ] One Abigail Hains , charged but two Sessions ago for Firing an Ironmongers house that was then her Master , but for want of full Evidence , and for that the Fire was happily seen and prevented , without much damage , she then got off , but now was Indicted for another Exploit : coming to live as a Maid servant with one Blagrave , a pretender to Physick , in Clarkenwell ; she had not been there above three days , but she took an opportunity to Rob him of a Gold Chain and Medal , a Watch , divers pieces of Plate , several rich Cloaths , some Money , & c. in the whole to a very considerable value ; But upon diligent search after her , she was apprehended and had before the Justice , confess 'd the Robbery , and so was now Convicted . [ Death . See summary . ] A Man and four Women were Indicted for Stealing of Goods : being met with them in a suspicious manner in the Fields , very early one morning , by certain honest men , they seiz 'd them , and on inquiry found they had robb 'd a woman that was a Quaker , who would not prosecute her self , but got a Friend to be bound to it : but by reason of the said Quakers refusing to give evidence , there not being at present sufficient proof against the Prisoners , the Jury was discharg 'd of them , and order given to make their She-friend appear next Sessions ; which if she were not free to do , then is she to be cast into Bonds . A Cooks Girl was found guilty for robbing her Mistriss , by breaking open a Trunk , and taking away a large parcel of broad pieces of Gold , Guinnies , Rings , and other things of value , and then locking the door , and leaving the Key at a Neighbours , fled ; but was soon apprehended , and acknowledged the Fact . On Wednesday in the afternoon , a Gentleman of Quality received his Tryal , for killing another that was his Kinsman , in the Temple-lane , the circumstances appeared to be thus : That the Prisoner being with some Gentlemen at the Devil Tavern in the evening , the Captain since killed , with some others , came into their Company , where he seemed much discontented , and pulling out a few shillings , said , that was all he had left of 200l . in a few days space ; intimating , that he had been at play ; and proposed to go to play with any of the Company , but all declined it : then he demanded four pound , that he said the now Prisoner should owe him ; who declared , that he knew nothing of it ; and the other insisted , that he did owe him so much , by the same token that such another Gentleman , then in the Company at the same time , ow 'd him 15s . but that other Gentleman affirmed he knew nothing either of the one or the other , which put the Captain into a farther passion ; but the Prisoner generously told him , they would talk of this Debt on the morrow , and if he could make it appear , he would readily pay him , and so they seemed to be made good friends , and the Company broke up , the Prisoner going first , and the Captain following , was seen to take him by the hand , and embrace him with the rest of the Company , thinking to be in kindness , they did not much observe them further , till missing them in the street , within two or three minutes , about half a score yards down the Temple-lane , they found them on the ground , the Prisoner uppermost , both their Swords drawn , but the Captains out of his hand lying by him , and he mortally wounded , whereof within few days he dyed ; but first with a most Christian and commendable charity , he both to the Minister who Administered the Sacrament to him , and to the Woman of the House where he lay , and to several Gentlemen , who all testified the same , did freely acknowledge that his Death was occasioned by his own rashness ; that he inticed down the Prisoner ( whom he confessed to have been the best friend he ever had in the world ) into the Lane , and then drew upon him , without any provocation , who defending himself , this Accident hapned ; upon which proof from his own mouth , and for that there was not the least colours of any prepensed grudg , and that the Prisoner himself was also wounded , the Jury could not find it any more than Manslaughter , for which he immediately took his Clergy , and was admitted to Bail , till he might procure a Pardon , in form , as to the Burning in the hand . One Gaddin , ( formerly a Barber ) a notorious Highway-man and Thief , Captain of a Gang , who by way of Reverence usually called him Daddy , was Indicted for a Felony in London , which appeared to be a Burglary in a person of Qualitie s House in Buckinghamshire , where he and four or five more calling in the evening by a counterfeit voice and name , got the door open , rusht in , and took away a very considerable Boot , in Money , Plate , & c. The Chief Evidence was one of his own gang , who was with him there , and set forth many other Burglaries , Robberies on the Highway , & c. they had engaged in together ; some of the Plate was taken in Redcross-street ; but it not appearing that the Prisoner carried it thither , or brought any of it farther than Southwark , it could be no Felony in London ; so he was set by in order to Tryal next Assizes for Buckingham . One Mr. Abel Bethsorrel was Arraigned for taking away a great parcel of Goods out of a Woman s house in St. Martins , in the day time , and the Witnesses swore it roundly ; but when the Prisoner came to make his defence , produced a Bill of Sale under her hand and Seal , for those and all other her Goods to 20l . which she could not disown , so that the prosecution was declared to be wholly malicious , and he honourably acquitted . Jane Byworth , and old shop-lift , and not long since burnt in the hand , was tryed for stealing a piece of Ribbon ; her Gallant who was with her in the shop , and committed , but since bailed out , had confessed it , and offered Composition for her , but he not appearing , and for that possibly he might do it himself without her knowledge , the Jury was favourable , and brought her in not guilty . So they did likewise on Mary Bolds , charged with picking five pounds out of a woman spocket near the Monument , but she would not swear directly the Prisoner had it . Edward Swinney and Mr. Henry Harrison , were tryed for killing one Jones , a Baylies Follower in Lincolns-Inn fields , on the 8th of August : A Bill of Middlesex being brought to the Sheriff , and thereupon a Warrant granted against Harrison , for 60l . owning to a Tailor ; one of the Sheriffs-Baylies , and five Followers or Assistants waited to take him , who came out of his dwelling in Lincoln Inn-fields in the afternoon , accompanied with Swinney the prisoner , and another Swinney his Brother , who is not taken ; but Mr. Harrison ( as 't is thought ) perceiving the Baylies struck out of the path , and hastned down to recover Lincolns-Inn back-gate , near which he made a stand , and the Baylies did not think fit to attack him there , but one of them , named Jones , turned down towards Shire-lane , upon which Harrison call 'd to him , and with Oaths and ill-names said , they were Baylies that dogged him , and called to the other two , to draw their Swords and kill them : hereupon , the Chief Baylie ( as they all swore ) gave him the words of the Arrest , and desired him to obey the Kings Writ ; but instead thereof , they came on with their Swords , and the said Jones engaging with Swinney , the Prisoner was by him slain : This was what the five Bayliffs now swore ; and 't was observable that there were no Witnesses for the King but they ; who likewise swore they had but two Swords amongst them . But for the Prisoners , several Witnesses testified , that the said Jones first assaulted Swinney , and that they heard no words of Arrest , and that the Baylies had four Swords drawn . The case seemed to lye very hard on the Prisoners ; the Writ and Warrant were proved : Five Bayliffs swore they did give Harrison the words of Arrest , and if so , the Killing of Jones in execution thereof must needs be Murder . But whether the Jury did not think fit to credit them , so it was , they only found the Prisoners guilty of Man-slaughter , who praying their Clergy , were Burnt in the Hand . And because the Court highly resented their Crime , thought it too much extenuated , they Committed them both back again to Newgate , for Eleven Months , without Bail or Mainprize . One Tho . Laurence a Waterman , having on the 18th of March was twelvemonth , killed one Tho . Palmer at Chiswick , with a blow on the head with a flattchet in a fray , was likewise burnt in the hand . A Carpenter was Indicted for Robbing a poor Woman , keeping a Cook shop in Magpy-yard , by breaking open a Trunk , where he and another were supposed to Dine , but she having never seen him but that time , till she apprehended him on suspicion , and he proving by five Witnesses , that he was all that day at work , at Justice Riches over the water , was acquitted . Four young Gentlemen Scholars of Westminster School , charged with killing a Bailey that came to make an Arrest near that School , which they pretend priviledged from such attempts , should likewise have been tryed this Sessions ; but the Coroner declaring that the Kings Evidence was not ready , and that there were about seven more of the Scholars supposed to be concerned in the Fact , who absconded , they were put off till the next Sessions ; and in the mean time , after some mature consideration of their Youth and Quality , to prevent the inconveniences that might attend their continuing so long amongst ill company in custody , were admitted to extraordinary Bail . Besides these , there were no fewer than Six and Thirty Men and Women , that within these Six Moneths last had been Condemned to Dye , and had obtain 'd Reprieves , who now all did on their Knees plead his Majesties General Gracious Pardon , on Condition of Transportation , among whom was one John Morgan , Condemned the second of May last for being a Popish Priest , who could very hardly be brought to accept of this Pardon , or to kneel whilst it was read , alledging that he had committed no Crime , needed no Pardon , had not sued for this , & c. But as before , the Testimony of Doctor Oates and others that he was sometimes maddish , got him into the Pardon , so now the consideration thereof excused his extravagancy . There were in all Five persons that received Sentence of Death , viz . Tho . Thompson , and Peter du Val , for the Murther before-mentioned ; Richard Wheeler , guilty by his own Confession of two Indictments , one of stealing a bay Mare , and the other for a Sword , Coat , Boots , 57s . in Money , and several other Goods at Totnam ; Abigail Haines , for Robbing Doctor Blagrave her Master ; and Margaret Taylor , a Girl , for Robbing her Mistriss , and refusing to tell what she had done with the Gold and the Goods stolen . There were also Seven Burnt in the Hand , Mr. Swinney , Mr. Harrison , and Tho . Laurence , for Manslaughter , Joseph Sharp and Tho . Cornwell , for Stealing of Lead from the Church . Tho . Dodd and Edw . Hardy for several Felonies . Besides these , there were no fewer than Six and Thirty Men and Women , that within these Six Moneths last had been Condemned to Dye , and had obtain 'd Reprieves , who now all did on their Knees plead his Majesties General Gracious Pardon , on Condition of Transportation , among whom was one John Morgan , Condemned the second of May last for being a Popish Priest , who could very hardly be brought to accept of this Pardon , or to kneel whilst it was read , alledging that he had committed no Crime , needed no Pardon , had not sued for this , & c. But as before , the Testimony of Doctor Oates and others that he was sometimes maddish , got him into the Pardon , so now the consideration thereof excused his extravagancy .
