All the Prisoner had to say for himself , was , That he met the other three upon the Road , and they forced him to ingage with them , and to go along with them ; which was a very improbable Story , and not believed by the Jury : So he was found guilty of both Indictments .

[ Branding . See summary . ] Mustapha Pochowachett a Turk , was Tried for committing the most Unnatural and Horrid Sin of Buggery , which is so detestable , and not fit to be named among Christians ; which he did on the 11th of this Instant May , upon the Body of one Anthony Bassa , Dutch Boy , of the age of 14 years , and upwards . Bassa swore , that they lay together in the Room , and in the Night-time the Prisoner assaulted him , and forced his Yard into his Body ; upon which the Boy cried out , to prevent which he stopt his Mouth with the Pillow , and used him in a very unnatural manner . The Surgeon swore that he had given the said Bassa the Venereal Distemper , and that the Boy was very ill with it . The Prisoner was ask 'd , What he had to say ? which was done by an Interpreter sworn for that purpose . The Prisoner told him , that he never did any such thing , only lay in the Room with him . But then the Surgeon further deposed , That he being order 'd to search the Boy , found two great Ulcers on both sides his Fundament , and that he was in a dangerous condition . That the Turk 's Members were shanker 'd , and much bloody , and a great hole upon the fleshly part of his Yard . The Turk said by the Interpreter , that he was not able to do such a thing , and would stand the Search , but that was not done . The Jury believ 'd the Boy 's [ Text unreadable in original . ] ; and the thing appeared very very foul and detestable before the Face of Christians , being a Crime so grievous in the sight of God , the Jury having maturely consider 'd of the Fact , brought him in guilty of Buggery . [ Death . See summary . ] Peter Whittingham , S - H - and A - H - were all Tried for High-Treason , in Cutting , Clipping , Filing , and Diminishing the Currant Money of England , viz . 10 Half-Crowns , 20 Shillings , and 20 Six-pences . The Evidence for the King and Queen deposed , That they were all seen at work ; Whittingham clipping money , S - H - Filing of it , and A - H - rubbing it upon a Leather to make it smooth . They made their Escape once from the Officers at first , but were taken sometime afterwards . Peter Whittingham was taken at the Salmon and Ball in Moorfields , and H - and A - in Mugwell-street . This was very clearly proved against them , and the clipt money was produced in Court as corroborating Evidence against them , which was shewed to the Jury . The Prisoners denied the Fact , and called divers of their Neighbours to justify their Reputation , urging , That one of the Witnesses for the King had malice against them , and did not prosecute , till they had took him up with a Warrant for suspicion of robbing the Prisoners of 50l . But yet the Court directed the Jury , That People that are Clippers , are commonly of good Repute , because they get their money easier than other men , therefore acted fairly with their Neighbours ; that a man might have a fair Character , and yet be an Offender in such a Case ; yet it was left to their Consciences , whether they did believe the Evidence against them ; if they did , they must find them guilty of High-Treason , otherwise acquit them . The Jury having well weighed the Case , brought them in Not Guilty . Thomas James was Tried for the Murther of one Francis Griffin , on the 6th of April last , by giving him a Blow with a Broomstick upon the left side of his Head , which gave him such a Bruise , that he died the 8th of May following . A Quarrel hapned betwixt them about striking a Horse , and James was seen to fling the Stick at the Deceased 's Head , upon which he fell down ; and afterwards his head being search 'd by a Surgeon , it was found broke , and a great depression was made upon the Scull , of which he languished and died . The Stick was but a small Stick , and probably he might receive the wound by the Fall ; for he fell down ( his Foot slipping ) against a Stair-Case , and no one saw the Stick cut his Head . Upon the whole he was acquitted . Matthew Pryor , a Coachman , was Tried for driving his Coach-wheel over the Leg of Ann Hewetson , which he did by Chance , not wilfully ; and the Woman standing in the way , he did not see her . So the Jury found that he did it by misfortune , therefore he was acquitted . Nathanael Peck of London , Labourer , was Tried for High Treason in Counterfeiting , Forging , and making one hundred false Guineas , & c. The Witness swore that Peck came to his House , and told him he had some Guineas to dispose of ; upon which he gave him 21s . 8d . a piece for 24 of them ; which when weighed , proved too light ; but he could not say they were false ones , and there was no other Evidence against him . So he was discharged . William Sutton was Tried for a Misdemeanor , for suffering Sir James Montgomery to make his Escape out of his hands , he being delivered into his Custody ( being a Messenger ) charged upon suspicion of High-Treason before the Secretary of State ; it was swore that Sir James was put into Sutton 's House , and two Centinels being set over him to keep him safe ; they gave him leave to go away , and they went with him ; but it did not appear that Mr. Sutton was privy to the matter , nor that he knew he went away ; but the Lock of the Door was broke open , which could be done by none but the two Centinels that stood at the Door : And Sutton proved , that he was gone abroad to execute a Warrant at the same time concerning the Government ; and this Witness swore for him , that he the said Sutton was a person very well affected to the present Government , and was always very careful in his business ; So he was Acquitted . Drury Wake Gent . was Tried for the Murder of one Thomas Smith a Constable , near Bloomsbury , by shooting him with a Pistol-Bullet into the Thigh , the 3d of April last . The Prisoner being suspected to be one of the persons that Robbed the House of Sir Richard Pigget of Woodford in the County of Middlesex , was pursued by some persons into the Field behind Montague House , in order to apprehend him , crying out a Highway-man . When he was in the Field , a great Rabble was running after him , throwing Brick-Batts at him ; upon which , Mr. Smith the Constable coming along the Field , met the Prisoner , telling him that he was a Constable ; and if he would surrender himself to him , he would preserve him from the Insolencies of the Mobb : But he refused it , and drew his Sword , swearing he would kill any man that should come near him , bidding Mr. Smith keep off , or else ( he swore ) God Damn him he would shoot him , and made a Pass at [ Text unreadable in original . ] put by with his Staff . Upon which Mr. Smith , being a man . Closed in with hi , and clasped him about ; and having his Constables Staff in his Left Hand , and a Pistol in the Right , he immediately discharged his Pistol upon the ground , directing it from the Prisoner , that it might not hurt him . After which , Mr. W. shot Mr. Smith into the Thigh , who fell back and Cry 'd out , the Rogue has kill 'd me . It was proved that Mr. Smith shewed the Prisoner his Authority as a Constable , by producing his Staff , and very mildly desired him , in the King 's Name , to yield and surrender himself quietly to his power , he would protect him ; but he would not yield , swearing he would shoot him , as aforesaid . And if the Constable had not put the said W 's Pistol downwards towards the earth , he had shot him in the Belly . There were several Witnesses for the King , who all agreed in the matter of Fact , as aforesaid , & c. Mr. W. declared in his Behalf , That he was afraid of Bayliffs arresting him , and therefore made that defence for himself ; and that Mr. Smith came without a Staff or Warrant to seize him , therefore he thought him not to be a Constable , and that he never told him he was one . He called some Witnesses that were in the Field at the same time the Murder was done , who could not confirm what he asserted , but only declared in the general , That they saw the Prisoner and Mr. Smith struggling together ; that there were two Pistols shot off , that Mr. W. went off last . The first Witness against him further declared , That the Prisoner desired him not to inform the Court at the Trial , that he had any Society with Bernard , and the rest that Robbed Sir Richard Pigget 's House , for that might be a prejudice to him , & c. The Prisoner urged further , That what he did , was in his own defence : But was told that could not be for all the Evidence agreed viva voce , that he killed him maliciously and basely , being unwilling to be taken , lest he should be prosecuted for the Burglary at Sir Richard Piggets . The Evidence being full , he was found guilty of the Murther . [ Death . See summary . ] Mary Lawrence was Tried for stealing a Gold watch value 8l . and 45s . in money , from George Duch .

She swore that she saw Gayler clip money , but could say nothing against Dodd . Another Witness for the King declared , that he had seen them change narrow money for broad money oftentimes , and that he had received money that was newly clipt from Mrs. Tills several times , and that there was a great Gang of them concerned in the carrying on the Trade ; particularly one Ann Auguish and Moll Rowley not yet taken , who were wont to procure the money for the Clippers of it , and a pair of Shears , and a half Crown that was brass , were produced in Court . Mrs. Tills denied the Fact , and said , that the Shears were useful to her Husband in the way of his Trade , he being a Watchmaker . Dodd denied the Fact , so did Gayler ; and they had several of their Neighbours who gave a good Character of Mrs. Tills , and that they had known her 20 years , and never found that she clipt any money ; one of which said there was a bad sort of people did resort to Till 's House ; others said that Gayler was a Woman that works hard for her living at washing , and the Servant Sarah Jyn was an ill person , and frequented Bawdy-houses in White-Fryers ; and that Mrs. Tills and Jyn us't to fall out ; Another Evidence swore that Dodd had been whipt in Bridewell several times for picking Pockets ; and that she was heard to say that she was to help an old Gentlewoman to a Maidenhead for a Guinea , and that it was the common Report of the Women of the Town ; that she had left the Trade of Pocket-picking , and was now turned Niggler , ( that is to say ) a Clipper of money ; all this was not enough to convict them , there being but one Evidence , and she a doubtful one too ; So they were all acquitted . Thomas Blundevill was Tried for being a Common Defrauder and Cheater of Their Majesties Subjects of their monies , which he did by Forging and Counterfeiting Letters signed with the Sign of the Post-Office General ; particularly , he delivered two Letters to one Mr. Robert Tempest , supposed to come from Ireland , and Mr. Tempest paid 10d . a piece for them ; and there were several such Letters produced in Court against him ; and one Gentleman Swore that the Prisoner confest that he had been us 'd to practice such doings ; and that he had delivered several Letters to other persons besides Major Tempest , which agreed with his own hand that he was seen to write before the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor ; one Letter was read in Court , which he sent to Mr. Dodd from the Poultrey Comter , telling him that he would discover other People that were Accomplices with him , provided Mr. Dodd would be favourable to him , and make him an Evidence against such that he would impeach .

The Evidence for the Prisoner , who took the said Johnson for the Fact , did testify , That there had been by Johnson 's confession , a Correspondence between the Doctor and the said Johnson , which the Doctor did not deny ; and that he had received a Letter from the Doctor ( whose Hand he said he knew very well ) wherein the Doctor had promised a Pardon to the said Johnson in case he would swear against the Prisoner ; and that Johnson declared it was the Doctor 's whole Design to lay the matter upon the said Mr. Bradshaw , for that he was in a condition to pay the Sum he was robb 'd of ; but saith Johnson , this I can not , nor will not do , for Mr. Bradshaw is innocent and I believe he is as honest a man as any one living ; further Evidence for the Prisoner testify 'd , that the said Johnson had been seen to have 100 or more Guineas at one time , and that since the Robbery he had paid several Debts , particularly the King 's Tax , that he run away with 12l . and that the said Johnson had built a House that cost 20l . or more . Further Evidence for the Prisoner testified , That the said Johnson had committed several Robberies by several Names , one of which was on Sir William Bond of 100l . and that he fled for the same , and was never heard of till this time ; others testified , that Johnson was a common Gaol-bird , and had been burnt in the hand , which appear 'd to the Court . The Prisoner , to take off the suspicion the Doctor had of him , proved by the Doctor 's Confession in Court , that he had employed him in all , or most of his Affairs , since the time of the Fact being committed ; and by his Letters , not only with his moneys , but with his Mistress also ; which Letters were produced by the Prisoner and read in Court , the Prisoner lost 20l . of his own money . So upon the whole matter , the Court finding the said Johnson to be a notorious Rogue , for that he had sworn one thing to the Grand Jury , and another to the Court ; the Grand Jury happening to hear it , desired leave of the Court to give them information of it , which they accordingly did , looking upon it to be a malicious Prosecution : And that Dr. Littleton 's only using very reflecting Language , that was nothing to the purpose ; and the Prisoner being a person of undoubted honesty and Reputation , of which the Court was well satisfied , and look upon the matter to be rather malice than fact ; he was acquitted , and Johnson taken into custody .
