Elizabeth Wigenton of Ratcliff Parish , was Tryed for the Murther of a Girl about Thirteen years of age , which was her Apprentice , the manner of the Murder being thus : She being by Trade a Coat-maker , and having set the Girl upon a Piece of Work , she had not done it so well as she required , whereupon , she beat her grievously , the which not sufficing her cruel rage , she went and got a bundle of rods , ( and a man to hold her ) with which , after she had bound her , she whiped her so unmercifully , that the blood ran down like rain ; yet could she not be perswaded to desist , till the Girl fainted away with crying , and of her unmerciful usage in a short time dyed . Upon her Tryal she pleaded little in her own defence , onely saying , that she did not think to kill her . So that it being proved that she had been a cruel Woman by all her Neighbours , she was found guilty of wilful Murther . [ Death .

John Peetly Victualler , living in Whetstones-park was Arrained and Tryed for the Murder of one Mr. Gerard , Nephew , as 't is said , to my Lord Gerard ; the circumstances of which , were these : The Party killed , with several other young Gentlemen , being late abroad , on the tenth of this instant in Holborn , took it in their way to come through Whetstones park , where spying Lights in Peetly 's house , they knocked hard at the door , and bid him open it , the which he refusing , one or more of them , began to break the windows , and having Linkmen with them , they threw up lighted Links , the which , as Peetly said , did set fire to some Linnen in a Closet , at which he being Allarumed , got his Carbine in his hand , charged with small Bullets , and pursued them up great Queen-street , till they came to the upper end o n't , where the standing Watch had stayed them , and caused them to deliver their Swords , whenas Peetly thrusting among the croud , was pushed by a Watchman , and thereupon his piece went off , and shot the aforesaid Gentleman in the Thigh , of which Wound he shortly dyed : but the Prisoner pleading that the Gun went off without his knowledge , he was Acquitted . Anne Ditcher , received her Tryal for stealing forty yards of Serge , and a Campaigne Coat out of the Shop of one Mr. Hatton in Drury-lane ; the Discovery of the Robbery was by a little Boy , who being taken upon suspition for hankering about the Shop , confessed that he knew where the Goods were , and that he would carry him to the place where they were sold , which he did , being at a Brokers in Southwark .

[ Death . See summary . ] Thomas Boys was Indicted for stealing a Shirt , a Cravat , and a pair of worsted stockings ; the which being confessed by him to have been stollen from one Edward Steevens of Hounslow , he was found guilty to the value of ten pence . Dorothy Mathews , an old Shop-lift , was Tryed for stealing about a pound and half of Silk , and near sixty yards of Taffeta Ribbon , and Ferrit , from one Elizabeth Waite in Holborn . She coming into the Shop on the 19th of October , there being onely a little Girl in it , demanded where her Mistress was ? who told her , she was gone into London ; whereupon , she desired to see some Ribbon , which the Girl shewed her , but none would please , till she had the box of Ribbon set before her , whenas one of her Accomplices coming in , and desiring to see some likewise , held the Girl busie , till she stole the Goods aforesaid ; but ere she could make her escape , being apprehended and carried before a Magistrate , the Goods were found about her ; so that the proof being plain , she was Convicted of the Felony . [ Death . See summary . ] Eleanor Cockman was Tryed as being accessary to the Murther of one Smith , who was shot by one Orme , since flead , by reason a Watch which appertained to the Deceased , was found in her custody ; but she alleadging she found it in the pocket of the dead man , whose breeches she had to wash , delivered her by the hands of his friends , she was acquitted . Jobe Laud was Tryed for stealing a Mare , appertaining to William Gun , the which he had afterwards sold to one Church , the bargain being made at the George in Leather-lane , the said Church being taken upon her back , as he was riding into the Countrey , but upon this Tryal , the party from whom she was stole not appearing , the prisoner was acquitted of the Fellony . Frances Emington was Tryed for stealing about 600 weight of Red-wood from the Royal African Company , which was taken from on board a Lighter , lying in the River of Thames , the Hatches of the said Lighter being broken open in the absence of the Waiters . The wood being taken about a Month after , as he was conveying it by the help of Porters into Thames street , where he pretended he had sold it to a dry Salter ; and did so far impose upon his Apprentice , as to lodge some of it in his house , he being gone into the Country , so that the Fellony being plainly proved , he was found guilty . Blanch Thomas a servant-wench was Tryed and found guilty , for Robbing her Master William Palmer of St. Martins in the fields , of the Sum of Ten pounds , which his Wife had hid between the Mat and the bed ; so that as she was making the bed she found it , and converted about three pounds of it to her own use , before they missed it ; but she being apprehended for the same , delivered the other moiety . Her plea was , that she found it , and therefore imagined it was lawfully hers , but that weak excuse did not serve her turn . Thomas Underthorp was Indicted for having Two Wives , vix . Elizabeth Toogood , whom he Marryed at Dukes-place ; and Dorothy Martin , which he since Marryed in Worcestershire , with whom he had a competent Portion . Both the Marriages were proved against him by several persons , the former by the man that gave him in Marriage , and by several others , the latter by the Woman herself , who appeared in Court , the former not appearing , but upon proof she was alive , he was Convicted of the Felony . Richard Johnson , and John Cooper , two Chair-men , were Tryed for the Murder of one Mr. Washborn , whom they killed with excessive beating , on the second of December ; the cause of quarrel was their rushing him with their empty Chair , against the rails of Northumberland-house ; near Charing-cross , so that he striking them with his Cane , they fell upon him , and gave him so many bruises , that he dyed within twelve days after : wherefore they were Convicted of Man-slaughter , there being no proof that he struck them first . John Oliver , a French-man , who could speak no English , was Indicted for breaking into a Chamber , at Man 's Coffee-house at Charing-cross , and taking thence a Ring , some Lace , and other small matters : he pretended , as his Interpreters said , that he went there only to sleep , when he was taken upon the stairs , but being searched , the things were found about him ; but for want of the Constables Evidence , who searched him , he was found not guilty , by reason none gave Evidence against him in Court , or saw the things taken about him . John Bully , a Popish Priest , was brought to the Barr , and his Indictment read . To which he pleaded he had been Tried for the same Fact at Lancaster , in August last , and that he ought not to be Tryed twice for the same . But in that the Opinion of the Court over-ruled him , intimating , that this Indictment being laid for his being a Priest , in October last , he might since the former have taken Orders from the See of Rome . Whereupon he had directionto get Council , and put in his Plea , and Time allowed him for that purpose ; but when he was brought to the Bar again , he made a long Apology , alleadged as before : So that at his humble Request , the Court thought sit to continue him untried till next Sessions .
