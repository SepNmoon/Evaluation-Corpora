See Sessions Book , No . 7. p. 122 . He was try 'd the same Sessions for stealing a Hat , from William Young in his Dwelling-House , and convicted ; but received corporal Punishment . William Thorn . I was robbed of my Watch , and a Brass Seal , and my Hat , and four Shillings , or more at Holloway ; but I ca n't swear to the Prisoner , for 't was Night ; I was going from Holloway to Highgate , when they were taken from me . The Watch was found at a Pawn-Broker 's in Shoe-Lane This is the Watch I then lost . Richard Wornel . I took Mann [ the Evidence ] and Udal . Mann told me they had robbed two Men about Highgate , and told me where this Watch was pawned . I found out the Prosecutor , and went with him to the Pawnbroker 's , where he saw the Watch and claimed it . Thomas Mann . The Day after Christmas Day the Prisoner and I were going to the Castle at Holloway ; as we went along , we called at a House and had some Pork Stakes . We returned about Seven or Eight o'Clock , and robbed a Man of a Hat ; Udal took the Man 's Watch out of his Pocket , and some Money . He was the Man that robbed the Prosecutor , and He carry 'd the Things Home to his Lodgings , at Mr. Morris 's in White-Lyon-Court ; and next Morning he and I carried it to a Pawnbroker 's , in Shoe-Lane , and he pawned it for ten Shillings , while I stood at the Door . He brought out ten Shillings , and gave me five . Richard Wernel . When I took Mann and Udal , Mann was carried to one House , and Udal to another . Mann desired to be admitted an Evidence , and it was granted . He gave me Directions where the Watch was pawned for ten Shillings . I went to the Pawn-broker 's , and demanded the Watch , telling the Man it was stole . He refused to produce it , upon which I sent for Mr. Thorn , and he described it . and said it was in a Tortois-shell Case , and a Piece was broke out ; then the Pawnbroker produced it , and Thorn immediately owned it ; but we could not have it , unless we paid twelve Shillings , and twelve Shillings I was obliged to pay for it . The Prisoner desired to be admitted an Evidence , and said he could hang three or four ; but , as he had been admitted an Evidence several Times before , his Request was deny 'd . He wanted to have been made an Evidence against Mann , and said he could put three or four more into his Information . He did not deny the Fact at all . Mann . The Prisoner would have killed the Man , for fear of being discovered , had it not been for me . Thorn . Yes ; He threatened me ; - 't was upon the long Causeway . Udal . The Evidence and I were Debtors in the Marshalsea Prison ; we broke out and made our Escape . He has done this for Lucre , - for the Sake of the Reward , that he may clear himself of his Debt . Mann . Udal broke open the Goal himself , and let me out with him . The Pawnbroker , William Key , was sent for , and brought into Court . He urged that he was but a Servant to Mr. Crockat . Crockat appeared , and was told , That his Profession was a most scandalous one ; That Pawnbrokers were the Encouragers of Felons , and it would be well if they would be warned to get into honester Callings and Employments . Crockat and another Person were bound for Key 's good Behaviour and Appearance next Sessions . He was a second Time indicted for assaulting John Bradford on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c , taking from him a Hat , value 1 s. a Drugget Coat , value 5 s. and five Shillings in Money , Dec. 26 , John Bradford . I was going the 26th of December from London to Finchley , and between the Halfway House and Upper Holloway , I was met by two Men . One of them run against me and jumbled hard upon me , as if he was fudled . I pushed him away , and bid him stand up . He came upon me again , and said - you 're the Man , - you 're the Man . Then they both attacked me , and robbed me of my Hat , Coat , and about Five Pence in Money . The Prisoner is very much like one of the Men . When the Prisoners were taken , Mann [ the Evidence ] told me where I might find my Coat . Mann . As the Prisoner and I were going to Holloway , we met this Man ; he attacked him , and said , - d - mn your Eyes , if you do n't pull your Coat off , I 'll kill you . I said , - no , do n't hurt him . G - d d - mn you ( says the Prisoner ) I 'll kill him and you too , and he threw up his Hanger , and was going to chop the Man down . We pawned the Coat for three Shillings . Bradford . The Pawnbroker said he had lent four upon it . Mann , Then he cheated me of a Shilling . Bradford . I found my Watch according to the Accomplice 's Direction . The Evidence was cautioned in a pathetick Manner , against following those Courses , which would inevitably bring him to the same melancholy End the Prisoner was like to come to . He was found Guilty on both Indictments . Death . 144 , 145. John Maud and John Mitchell were indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , value 5 l. the Goods of John Starkey , Nov. 9 . And , 146. John Brady for receiving the same , knowing it to be stole , Nov. 10 . John Fife . One Saturday in the Afternoon , the 4th or 5th of November , I met Muad and Mitchel , in St. Clements Church Yard , and they asked me to go along with them ; so we went to Covent-Garden , and from thence to Leicester-Fields , Piccadily , and Broad-street , near Carnaby Market . In Broad-street we saw Mr. Starkey 's Door open . Maud went into the Entry ; turned the Brass Nob of the Parlour Door , and went in , and brought out a Tankard in his Apron . 'T was about Dusk , between four and five o'Clock . I stood at the Door , and Maud came running out with the Tankard , wrapped up in his Blew Apron ; then we all run away to Mary Lambert 's in Parker 's Lane ; she called down John Fletcher , who lodged in her House , and she asked him to sell it for us . He said he would sell it next Morning ; and accordingly , the next Morning we went with it to the Prisoner Brady ; but Brady was unwilling to buy it while We were there . However , I saw the Bargain made ; Brady bid two Guineas for it ; we would not take it , and , at last he gave us three Pounds . The Money was paid to Fletcher , and his Wife had eighteen Shillings of it . Mr. Starkey . I lost a Tankard , but what became of it , I do n't know . Fife . We stole it about the 4th or 5th of November last . Mr. Starkey . 'T was about that Time I lost it : The Value of it was about six or seven Pounds . I never have had it again , tho ' I advertised it , and how this Discovery come to be made , I know not John Taylor . I have known Maud five or six Years . His Mother brought him up carefully , and I never heard any Harm of him , but believe he was tempted to do this Thing by Fife , when they met in St. Clement 's Church-Yard . All Acquitted . 147 , 148. James Lawlor , alias Lawley , and James Leonard , were indicted for assaulting George Lines on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Hat , value 21 s. a Peruke , value 3 l. 3 s. and a Gun , value 25 s . Dec. 24 . George Lines . On Sunday the 24th of December , between ten and eleven at Night , I was coming from the Castle Tavern , in Denmark street , with a Gun upon my Shoulder , and Lawlor stopped me , and asked me , what I had to do with that Gun . I ca n't be so positive to the other Prisoner as I am to him , but I was struck at , and my Hat and Wig were taken away , and then they knocked me down . They knocked me down as dead as a Herring , and then they took my Gun . I ca n't swear Lawlor took it , but he was one of the Men . Lawlor . Did you ever see me before in your Life ? Lines . Yes ; I saw him that Night ; but I did not want to see him . Lawlor . As God is my Judge I never saw him before . Lines . There was a Lamp close to the Place , and I can swear Lawlor was one of the Men . Lot Cavenagh . This Lawlor , and Leonard , and I , have gone out a thieving together , several Times . I lived in Lawler 's Cellar , and have known both the Prisoners thirteen or fourteen Years ; I have gone a thieving with them in Ireland . When we committed this Robbery , there was another Man with us , beside the two Prisoners , and we laid hold of the Prosecutor , while Leonard watched on the other Side of the Way . We drank a Pint of Gin , between us four , before we went out ; and wanting Money , we said we must have it , so as we were coming down Drury-Lane , over against the Coal Yard , we saw this Man with his Gun Lawlor said to him , - d - mn you , What Business have you with a Gun , and struck him with the Stock of the Pistol which he had in his Hand , but he did not fall down I held one of his Hands , to prevent his laying hold of any of us ; and at the second Blow , he was knocked down . We took his Hat and Wig before he was knocked down , but I ca n't tell whether the Gun was seized before or after . The Name of the fourth Man in our Company , was Noland ; and Leonard was to stand on the other Side of the Way , and to cry Tommy ! Tommy ! when any body came by : And he calling out Tommy , as soon as we had got the Man 's Hat and Wig and Gun , we had not Time to rifle his Pockets , but were obliged to run away with what we had got . Lawlor pawned the Wig for six Shillings , and I pawned the Hat for three , to a Man , who , I believe is in Court , but they were not both pawned the same Day ; and Leonard did not go to the Pawnbroker 's with us , for we were afraid if so many of us went , the Folks would not have a good Suspicion [ Opinio ] of us . The Hat was pawned first , and in two or three Days Time , we pawned the Wig , and Leonard staid at Home in Lawlor 's Cellar , while we were gone . The Money for the Hat and Wig , was nine Shillings , which we divided , and had two Shillings and three Pence a piece . I never was before a Judge for any Dishonesty in my Life . - Thompson . I know the Hat and Wig very well . This is Mr. Lines 's Hat . I carry 'd it to have a new Loop put to it ; and this is the Wig he had on when he went out that Sunday , - but he came home without it . I have carry 'd it twenty Times to the Barber 's . He had them both on , when he went out , but he came home without either . Lines This is my Hat and Wig . A Witness . Cavenagh brought the Hat to me , and wanted three Shillings upon it . Lawlor came with the Wig , and asked six Shillings upon that , telling me , he should fetch it again in two or three Days . I thought them both very honest Men . Lawlor . Ask this Witness if he knows James Lawlor ? The Witness . I ca n't swear justly to him , - but that Man , [ pointing to Lawlor , ] is like him and the Man that brought the Wig said his Name was James Lawlor . Lawlor . 'T is not very likely I should pawn a Thing I had stole in my own Name . Q. to Lines . How came you to be out with a Gun on Saturday Night ? Lines . The Man of the Tavern wanted a Gun for the Train 'd Bands , so I sent for it , and would have sold it him , but we could not agree for the Price ; so I was carrying it home again . Lawlor . I can give an Account where I was that Night . Call Garret Cavenagh . Garret Cavenagh . I know Lawlor ; he lodged with me about a Year ago , and paid me honestly : He has no Way to get his Bread but by Work , and the Labour of his Hands . I am a Smith , and he has work 'd with me . I know nothing more . Mrs. Buckland . He work 'd with me upwards of three Years , in and out , and I never saw any thing dishonest in him . I live in Princes-street , by Bridgewater-Square . Mrs. Lambeth . Leonard came to lodge with me a Fortnight before Christmas last ; and on Christmas-Day in the Morning he and his Wife had a Quarrel , and she tore his Coat , and he could not go out all Day . Mr. Lines came to my House on St. Stephen 's Day , and said he had lost his Hat and Wig , and Gun , and said he would give a Treat to have them again . A Witness . As to Leonard , I have intrusted him with more than my own , backwards and forwards , and he always behav 'd well . The second Day after Christmas Day , Lines came into Lambeth 's House , and said he had been robb 'd of his Hat , Wig and Gun , in Drury Lane ; and that the Man who knock 'd him down was in a close Set-to Coat . Leonard was then in the House , and Lines would have drank with him , but Leonard refus 'd : Lines told us at the same time , that he was very much in Liquor . Two other Witnesses gave Leonard the Character of an honest labouring Fellow . Both Guilty , Death . 149. Henry Johnson was indicted for ripping and stealing 148 lb . of Lead , fixed to the Dwelling-house of Hugh Colley , Clerk , Jan. 18 . He was a second Time indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of Hugh Colley , Clerk , about the Hour of Ten at Night , with a felonious Intent to steal his Money and Goods , Jan. 18 . The Rev . Mr. Colley . I live at Mile-end Green , on the 18th of Jan. last , about Ten in the Evening , as my Wife and I were sitting by the Fire , in the Parlour , we heard a Cough before the Door : We imagin 'd it was somebody going past the Door ; but in a little time we heard the Cough repeated several times ; my Wife imagin 'd it was in the little fore Garden before the House . Immediately following the Coughs , there was a great Noise upon the Top of the House , - the Roof of the House shook ; upon which I got up and went into the Hall , Immediately Mr. Owen ( a Neighbour ) came and said , there was a Man upon the House . Mr. Lee ( my Writing-master ) and I went out forwards to see if we could discover any thing , and Evan Davis went out backwards ; Afterwards we return 'd to the Door to get into the House , but it was shut , and we could not get in . While I stood at the Door , I heard a Noise in the House like breaking open Doors : I was in a great Consternation , and imagin 'd that the Rogues had got in backwards , and had taken Possession of the House ; upon this I ran to the back Part of the House , and kick 'd against a Door in the Middle of the Garden , and got into a Passage , which led to the Window of the Room where my Wife and I lie ; she was there crying out , Thieves ! Murder ! Davis was with me ; and when I had got into the House , I call 'd in Mr. Lee and Mr. Owen . My Wife was in her Chamber , almost dead with Fear , - the Maid in Fits , and the young Gentlemen were running from one Room to another in their Shirts . After I had encouraged my Wife , Mr. Lee and I examin 'd the House , and when we were in the lower Part of it , Davis call 'd out , he had taken the Man ! and I went out immediately , and saw the Man in his Possession . He had deceived Davis , by running out of the House , and crying Thieves ! without his Hat , ( which we afterwards found in the House ) so Davis at first thought it was Lee , but when he found his Mistake he pursu 'd him : he ( the Prisoner ) had then Trowsers on , and in getting over the back Pales , the Tenter-hooks catched in his Trowsers ; there Davis and he were engaged , while I , and Owen , and Lee , were examining the House ; and the Prisoner said , he was sorry he had left his Hammer on the Top of the House , for if he had not , he would have dispatch 'd him . As to the breaking the House , he broke through a Window into the Garret , and when the Casement was broke open , there was nothing to prevent his Entrance . Mrs. Colley confirm 'd the former Circumstances , adding , That she went up Stairs , and heard the Garret Window break , and somebody jump in That the Man was no sooner got in , but he came down Stairs ; that upon hearing him come down , she ran into her Chamber , and shut the Door ; for she thought he was coming in after her , upon which she ran to the Window , and call 'd out Thieves ! Evan Davis deposed , That between Nine and Ten that Night , he saw a Man upon the House , and call 'd Mr. Lee , his Fellow-servant , and bid him go to the other Side of the House : That he ( Davis ) saw the Prisoner go to the Garret Window ; that he heard the Glass tumble down , upon which he went into the Back-yard , where he found his Master and Mr. Owen ; and looking towards 'Squire Heath 's Pales , he thought he saw his Coat upon the Pales , but when the Witness came up to the Pales , the Prisoner had got over them into another Garden ; that he was not hung upon the Tenter-hooks when he was taken , but was getting over a Brick-wall , when the Witness took him , and that the Prisoner was the Man who was taken by him . Mr. Lee confirm 'd the former Accounts , and every Circumstance therein ; adding , That Davis was in Pursuit of the Prisoner , and got over the Pales after him ; that he call 'd out to him ( the Witness ) and told him he had got the Man ; upon which he got over the Pales likewise , and assisted Davis in bringing the Prisoner to the House : that upon searching him , they found two crooked Nails and a Knife in his Pocket , and that he apprehended the Prisoner broke into the House with an Intent , not only to rob the House , but to murder them . Mr. Owen deposed , That while he was parting with a Friend near his own Door , a Man came from Mr. Colley 's Door , and look 'd hard at him : That he then gave a slight Cough , and pass 'd him ; upon which he ( the Witness ) went into his own House , and listen 'd : That hearing his Foot stop all on a Sudden , he partly opened the Door , and saw him at Mr. Colley 's Door , and heard him cough again : That he observed him to look up to the Top of Mr. Colley 's House ; that he look 'd up too , and seeing a Man upon the Top of the House , he call 'd out to Mr. Colley 's People , and told them there were Thieves on the Top of their House ; upon which the Man at the Door ran away : That Mr. Colley came out to the Witness , and they both went to Mr. Colley 's Door , but could not get in : That they then went backwards , and heard Davis cry out , - He had got the Man , upon which the Witness ran to assist him , and so the Prisoner was taken . Mr. Colley . I believe he would have robb 'd the House , after he had got what Lead he could , if he had not been discover 'd . Thomas Lion , the Constable , search 'd the Prisoner at the Watch-house , and found two Nails and a Clasp Knife in his Pocket . Bean ( Watchman ) . As we were carrying the Prisoner before Justice Jones , two Women met him , and gave him some Gin ; and he mumbled , and said , - D - mn his Eyes , if he had not left his Hammer behind him , he would have kill 'd Davis , when he seiz 'd him . The Prisoner 's Hat was found in Mr. Colley 's Hall , and he ( the Prisoner ) own 'd it the next Morning , and we gave it him thro ' the Rails of the Cage . Mary Randall . I found the Hat , and carry 'd it into the Parlour . Prisoner . I was accidentally coming by , and saw a Man upon the Eaves of the House , as if he would drop from thence ; so I went into the Yard , intending to take the Thief , and finding the Back-door open , ran in and cry 'd Thieves ! two Men stopp 'd me upon the Stairs , and said I was one of the Rogues ; I got from them , and they took me as I was pursuing the Men that got over the Wall . Guilty , Death . 150.

The House was broke sometime in the Night , between Eleven and Four , the 17th of January : A Quarry of Glass was broke ; through which the Casement was unhasped , and so the Person that robb 'd us came into the Hall , from whence I lost a Great Coat , a Shift of my Wife 's , a Shirt of mine , and a Piece of Calicoe Cloth , which I have not swore to . In a Day or two I saw these Things at Richard Smith 's at Ganford Green , and they prove to be mine .

A Pane of Glass was broke , by which Means the Casement was open 'd ; and I guess the Robbery was committed between Eleven and Twelve at Night .

A Witness . I bought these Boots of the Prisoner . Prisoner . I did sell the Man the Boots . Guilty , Death . 151 , 152 , 153. Edward Campbel , Elizabeth Booth , and Anne Lewis , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , were indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of William Mumford , between Twelve and One at Night , and stealing twenty-four Pair of Leather Shoes , val . 40 s . Feb. 13 . William Mumford . I went to Bed that Night about Eleven o'Clock , and fasten 'd my Door . I rose at Six the next Morning , and found the House broke , and twenty-four Pair of Shoes gone : The Lock of the Door and four Bolts were broke . We have Part of the Goods here ; this large Pair of Men 's Shoes , and these Girls Pumps , are mine , and they were mark 'd , - 2 s. each , but they have rubb 'd the Marks out . I do n't make them ; I only buy and sell . Campbel confess 'd before the Justice , that he broke open the House , between Twelve and One o'Clock , and that he took but fourteen Pairs , tho ' I miss 'd twenty-four when I came to number my Shoes . Q . What Sort of a House was this ? Mumford . 'T is a Shoemaker 's Shop , and a Cook 's Shop ; I lie in the House : There are eight Rooms in it . Martha Clark Last Valentine 's Day the three Prisoners , and Nan Lewis 's Husband , came and knock 'd at my Door about Six in the Morning : The two Women had their Aprons ty 'd up with something in them ; I asked them where they had been so early ? they told me , - to see the Birds couple , and to gather Chickweed . By and by Elizabeth Booth put some of her Shoes into my Bed , and Lewis convey 'd some of hers under the Table , and they both desired me not to take any Notice , for they would raise some Money upon them , unknown to the Men , and would share it between themselves I hid the Shoes , and Campbel and Booth stay 'd there all Day , and quarrel 'd about them . He damn 'd her for a Bitch , and said there was not all the Shoes ; she said , she knew nothing of them ; so he lick 'd her , and gave her two black Eyes . The next Day Booth and her Sister came and ask 'd for one Pair , which I deliver 'd into her Apron : And the Day after this Campbel and Booth came again , and as they both sat by the Fire , a Breeches-maker came in , and told me , ( in their Hearing ) that Mumford 's Shop had been broke open , and he had lost a great many Shoes : This was on Friday , and they both seem 'd very uneasy , and went away . The next Day , ( Saturday ) Booth came for the rest of the Shoes ; and I told her , I would stop them for Mr. Mumford . As I was speaking , - in came Campbel , and says Booth to him , - do you know any thing of Mumford 's Shoes ? he told her , no : Push off , says she , and so away he went . When he was gone , she ( Booth ) asked me if I stopp 'd the Shoes ? I told her , - yes . Then d - mn my Eyes , ( says she ) I 'll go and see if you have carry 'd them home to Mumford , or not . Upon this I sent to Mumford , and he own 'd the Goods . I ca n't say whether the Men had any of the Goods upon them when they came in ; 't was the two Women brought them in , in their Aprons . When they open 'd their Laps , and shew 'd me the Shoes , I thought 't was fine Chickweed . Prisoner Campbel . Did you see any of the Goods upon me ? Clark . He said before the Justice , - That he gave the Woman the Shoes , and if he had had a Sack , he could have carry 'd off more . A Constable . I had a Warrant against the Prisoners , and when we had found them , we carried them before Justice Mercer ; Campbel confessed that he broke open the Shop , and stole fourteen Pair of Shoes , and if there was more , the two Women cheated him . He said the two Women were there to receive the Goods , as he brought them out ; but they said they were both innocent in the Affair . Campbel . This Martha Clark owes me a Grudge , because I lodged in her House , and have not paid her ; so she and Addey the Thief-Taker have collogu 'd together , to take away my Life for the Sake of the Reward . Prisoner Booth . This Lewis and her Husband had quarrelled , and I went out with her that Night to see Him , about Twelve at Night . Between Five and Six in the Morning , we called at this Clark 's for a Dram . There we found Campbel and Lewis 's Husband , with their Aprons full of Shoes ; which they gave to us , and bid me tell Clark it was Chickweed . We had three or four Pints of Gin among us ; and about Ten o'Clock they called us out into the Entry , and took them from us . Campbel told me - his Master was going to break , and he had been helping him off with those Goods . Lewis . About Eleven at Night my Husband and I had Words ; he went out , and I asked Booth to go with me to see for him . We went to several Places , and at last we found him and Campbel at Clark 's with the Shoes . Mumford . When Booth was before the Justice she said Campbel broke open the Shop , and brought out the Shoes , and that she and Lewis took them into their Aprons . The Constable . Campbel told us , That Lewis 's Husband was with them ; that He and Lewis broke open the Shop , and the two Women were there , to assist in carrying the Goods away . Campbel . I did not get up that Morning , till about Five o'Clock , and is it probable that after I had drank Share of so many Half-pints of Gin , I should break open a House ! It takes up a good deal of Time to do such a Thing . Campbel , Guilty , Death . Booth Acquitted of Burglary , but Guilty of the Felony . Lewis Acquitted . [ Booth : Transportation . See summary . ] 154. Peregrine Audley , of St. Butolph without Aldgate , was indicted for assaulting William Mawley on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Hat value 2 s. a Peruke value 3 s : and a Shilling in Money , Feb. 11 . William Mawley . The Prisoner is the Man that robbed me of my Hat , Wig , and a Shilling , at the upper End of Rosemary-Lane , last Sunday Night was Se'en-night , between Eight and Nine o'Clock . He walked-up to me , and looked me full in the Face and , mumbling something , he gave me a Blow on the Breast , which surprized me , and then he took a Shilling out of my Pocket ? and when I found my Hat and Wig go , I caught hold of his Coat , but he was too brisk for me , and got loose . I pursued him to the Place where he was taken , getting over a Wall into Justice Riccards 's Yard . It was Moon-light , and I knew him again , and picked him out from all the People that were there . I saw the Colour of his Coat , - a White Loose Coat ; a blew Waistcoat , and a speckled Shirt . I saw him at the Justice 's , in half an Hour after I was robbed , and remember he had a Scar on one Side of his Face ; which I took Notice of , when he robbed me . I ca n't say I minded on which Side it was , when he robbed me , but I knew him again , and swore to him . John Scot . I know the Prisoner is the Man we took in Justice Riccards 's Garden , last Sunday was se'en-night , between Eight and Nine o'Clock . We carry 'd him into Mr. Riccards 's Parlour , and I was present when Mawley first saw him there . Several of our Men were standing together with the Prisoner , and he ( Mawley ) picked him out , and said , that was the Man who robbed him of a Hat , Wig , and a Shilling . The Prisoner had the same Coat on , that he has now ; a Blew Jacket , and a Cap . The Hat I found in a back Place , and the Wig in another , about six or seven Yards from the Place where I took him : I brought them into the Parlour , and Mawley owned them . ( He swore to them again in Court . ) Richard Walker . I live with Mr. Riccards ; and hearing there were Thieves in the Garden , I ran in , and seeing the Prisoner , I laid hold of him , and carry 'd him into the Parlour . The Prosecutor , when he came in , picked him out from among Twenty or Thirty People . James Bradford Last Sunday Se'en-night I heard a Cry of Thieves being the Garden , and I went out and found the Prisoner coming out of the Vault , I laid hold of him , but he was too-strong for me , and got away from me : So the last Witness came up and took him directly ; and when Maudley came in , he picked him out from among thirty or forty People . A Witness . I was the Officer that took him into Custody : I found the Prosecutor bare-headed , with only a Handkerchief about his Head , and he was positive the Prisoner was the Man that robbed him . Prisoner . I had been at the Glass House about a Quarter of an Hour , before the Maid said there were Thieves in the Glass House . I thought they had been only playing the Rogue : However , I went to the Door , and a Gentlewoman said , - 't was a long time before any body came to the House . Madam , says I , I came as soon as I could ; then Mr. Riccards bid me go and see if any Body was in the Vault : so I went and poked about there , and these People came and took me , and then the Justice deny 'd that he had sent me there . Guilty , Death . 155. James Grimson , alias Grimshaw , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of John Ridley , about Eight at Night , and stealing a Cloth Coat , a Cloth Waistcoat , a Pair of Buck skin Breeches , five Shirts , five Guineas , four Half Guineas , and twelve Pounds thirteen Shillings in Money , the Property of the said Bridley , in his Dwelling House , Feb. 8 . John Ridley . My House was broke open the 5th of February . I keep Coaches , and there is a Stable joins to my House , and a Door in the Stable , that goes up Stairs to my Chamber . This Door in the Stable must be broke first , and then the Chamber-Door . I went out in the Morning about Nine o'Clock , and left the Prisoner in the Stable , for he used to help me about my Coaches , and I did not come home 'till between Nine and Ten at Night . I am sure I locked the Chamber Door , for I called him up and gave him a Glass of Brandy , before I went out , and he saw me lock the Door when I came out . But when I came home , I found the Door broke , and this Iron was left in my Room , which Mr. Johnson in Grays-Inn Lane proved to be the Prisoner 's , and the Prisoner owned Mr. Johnson gave it him . I lost seven Shirts , a Cloth Frock , a Cloth Waistcoat , a Pair of Buck-skin Breeches , and 20 l. in Money . I am positive I had all these Things in the Chamber on Saturday Night , and no one else had been in the Room from that Time to the Time I came home , and found I was robbed . When the Prisoner was taken , one of my Shirts was upon his Back , and he owned it was mine . He deny 'd his taking any thing else , at first , but afterwards , when he found I was about to search his Lodging , he confessed his taking every thing , but the Money ; and he acknowledged that he he forced open the Door in the Stable with this Iron . Prisoner . Were all the Things you found in my Custody your 's ? Ridley . Yes : - The Shirts were all numbered and marked with I. R. They are in the Constable 's Possession , but he could not be here . Elizabeth Basiere . The Prisoner lodged in my House , a Week and two Days ; and two Days before he was taken up , he desired me to tye up four Shirts in a Napkin for him , and put them in a Chest which stood in his Chamber , which I did , without looking for any Marks , either good or bad ; and seeing a Coat , Waistcoat and Breeches upon his Bed , I put them in likewise . I ca n't tell whether he had these Things when he came to my House at first , nor did I know what Linnen he had ; but three of the Shirts , and the Breeches , were found there , which Mr. Ridley owned , when he searched his Room , and one of the Shirts was upon his ( the Prisoner 's ) Back , but the Coat and the Waistcoat were gone I was present when Ridley searched , and he carry 'd the Things he claimed before the Justice . During the Time the Prisoner lived at my House , he used to go out in the Morning , and come home at Night to Bed . I never saw him but twice in his Room , and I know nothing of his Character . A Coachman brought him to me , as an honest Man , and he behaved as such , to the best of my Knowledge . Bury . Did he break the Door in the Stable , or the Chamber Door with that Iron ? Ridley . He broke the Door in the Stable first , and then the Chamber Door . The Stable Door was a strong Door , but he bent the Staple of the Door back , and then forced open the Chamber Door , which he saw me lock ; 't was a Stock-lock , and a very good one : When he came out , ( I apprehend ) he came thro ' the Coach-house , which was fastened on the Inside with a wooden Pin ; for those Doors were left open , and the Pin was gone . Prisoner . The Shirts were , - all my own , - every one , - all my own , and the Breeches too . I bought the Breeches in Monmouth-street , and the Shirts in Rag-fair , but nobody was with me when I bought them . Acquitted of the Burglary * , Guilty of the Felony . * Burglary is breaking into an House in the Night , with a Felonious Intent . In Law , 't is Night when one Person 's Face can not be distinguished from another ; Now , although the Prisoner confessed he broke open the Door , he did not in his Confession own at what time it was ; and as the Prosecutor was out in the Morning the Offence charged as Burglary might have been committed before Night .

On the 29th of January , I had been at a Club , at The Black Hog in St. Martin's-Lane , and as I was coming home about Ten o'Clock at Night , I met the Prisoner at the Bottom of King-Street , Westminster ; she took hold of me , and said , - Master , will you treat ? I told her , I could not afford it . Well , says she , if you 'll treat this Time , I 'll treat next . Upon these Conditions , I said , I did not care if I did . Then she bid me come along with her . So she carry 'd me to the House of one Stark , in King street , and I spent three Pence , then I said I would go home . She told me she would not part with me so , and followed me out to the Door ; we stood talking together about a Quarter of an Hour , and in that Time she picked my Pocket , and then ran in Doors , and shut the Door upon me . I told her she had got my Watch , and called to have the Door opened , but it was not opened . Then I called the Watch , and they made them open the Door . There were other Women in the House , beside the Prisoner , so the Watchmen asked me , which of these Women had robbed me ? I told them I did not see her , I believed she was got off , and the Watchmen said , they could not search the House without a Warrant ; but the Man of the House telling us we might search , tho ' we had no Warrant , we did search , and found the Prisoner hid in a Closet ; so she was carry 'd to the Round house for that Night , and next Morning we had her before Mr. Frazier . Before him , she said she knew nothing of the Watch , but it was produced at the same Time , by the Prisoner 's Husband , and then she told the Justice she had found it . Prisoner . Ask him whether he felt me take it ? Cheveny . No ; I did not ; but there was no one at the Door , or in the Entry with me , but the Prisoner . George Stark . The Prosecutor came to my House , and desired me to take his Watch in Pawn 'till next Morning . I refused to take his Watch , but told him I would let him have a Shilling or two 'till the next Morning . D - mn it , says he , if you wo n't take it in Pawn , I 'll go out of the House . I believe the Prisoner and he might have a Pot of Beer together , and then they went out together , for about five Minutes : After which the Prisoner ran into the House again ; he followed her and said - G - d d - mn the Bitch , she has picked my Pocket , and he called the Watchmen , who took the Prisoner , but but they found no Watch upon her . However , in about half an Hour after she was confined , her Husband came and said , I have the Watch , - take it and carry it down to her . I would have nothing to do with it , so I bid him carry it down and deliver it himself , so he took the Watch from between the Window and the Window-shutter . When she was before the Justice the next Morning , she said she knew nothing of the Matter , but she desired me to go and speak to her Husband about it ; and I went up accordingly into her Room , and there the Watch was found between the Bed and the Sacking , and it was carried to Justice Frazier . She lodged in Cabbage-Lane , Westminster . The Constable . This is the Watch that was brought to Mr. Frazier . Stark . I ca n't swear to it , nor do I remember what she said before the Justice , when the Watch was brought . Constable . This is the same Watch which was deliver 'd to me before the Justice . Stark brought it in , and the Prosecutor swore to it . Cheveny . This is my Watch . Stark . I ca n't swear to it ; but I deliver 'd the same Watch which I found in her Lodging to Mr. Frazier . Constable . And Mr. Frazier deliver 'd it to me . Prisoner . I never saw the Watch to my Knowledge . I was going home , and this Man came up to me , and clapp 'd Two-pence Halfpenny into my Hand , to go and drink with him . I did not care to drink with a Stranger any where , so I went to this Mr. Stark 's , because I was afraid of him , but I never drank of the Beer , nor did I sit by him . Acquitted 162.

Thomas Cealey . I was coming down Fleet-street , the 26th of January between Twelve and One o'Clock in the Night , - I had been on an Errand , and was going home ; and a little on this Side Hanging-Sword Alley , in Cheapside , - Fleet-street , Fleet-street , I mean , - there Nan Price and Sarah Gresham met me , and knock 'd me down with their Fists ; - they struck me under the Eyes , and made 'em black for a Week . I got up , and they knock 'd me down again , and rifled me , and took my Money , - 18 s. and Twopence Halfpenny . After this they charged the Watch with me , and I was sent to the Compter ; so I charged the Watch with them , and they were sent away too . -The Element was thick ; 't was between Dark and Light ; - 't was middling . I am a marry 'd Man , and a House-keeper . I am positive they are the two Women . Price . Did not you swear before the Alderman , That you had been drinking a Pint of Beer with me in a House in White Lyon Court ? Cealey . No ; they would have had me gone into a House with them , but I refused it ; this was before they knock 'd me down . I charged them with the Robbery as soon as it was committed ; and they were taken into Custody as well as I , and the next Day we were all carry 'd before Sir William Billers , a little below Sadler 's Hall . - 'T was at Guildhall . ( It appear 'd by the Calendar , that they were committed by Sir John Salter ) Price . He swore before the Justice , that he was robb 'd in a House . A Woman . I saw that old Gentleman in the uppermost House in White Lyon Court ; and afterwards he said he had been robb 'd in that House , and would have had the Watchman have made them open the Doors , but the People of the House refused to do it . A Witness gave Price the Character of an honest Woman . Both Acquitted * * Cealey swore before Sir John Salter to a Private Stealing ; this Indictment was laid for a Street Robbery , on which , had the Prisoners been convicted , he would have been intitled to a Reward of 280l . 165.

John Dew . Mrs. Lynnel and I had been to see my Mother in the Strand , on the 4th of February ; we came back after Seven o'Clock , and at Fleet ditch we took Coach to carry us to St. Margaret 's Hill . On the South Side of St. Paul 's , the Prisoner came , and put something into the Coach , and another ( who was with him ) cry 'd out , - Stop ! stop ! but the Coachman drove on ; upon which the Prisoner ran from the Coach-door , and told the Coachman , - If he did not stop , he would knock his Brains out . The Coach was stopp 'd by the Prisoner ; and I open 'd the Coach-door and jump 'd out , Mrs. Lynnel jump 'd out after me , and slipp 'd down ; I had no sooner help 'd her up , but the Prisoner ran from the Horses Heads to the Coach door again , and cry 'd , - D - mn it , where 's the Man and the Woman that were in the Coach ! I cry 'd , here ; and he laid hold of me ; I took hold of him ; he had a Hammer in his Hand : But a Gentleman happening to come by , assisted me , and we took him to a publick House , 'till we could get a Constable . When the Constable came , we found a Peruke under him , but he would not own it belong 'd to him . This is the Hammer ; and a Knife was also found in his Pocket . He beg 'd hard to be let go ; but the Constable secur 'd him , and the next Morning when he was carry 'd before Sir John Thompson , he said he believed the Wig that was found under him , ( the Night before ) was his , and it was accordingly return 'd to him by the Constable . I apprehend his Design was to rob us , by his stopping the Coach . Sarah Clark . I was coming out of Red Lion Court , on the South Side of St. Paul 's , and heard a Cry of - Thieves ! - Murder ! when I had got to the End of the Court , I heard somebody say , he had a Pistol ; I look 'd and pok 'd about , and found this Hammer . I ask 'd who this belong 'd to ? and the Coachman came up , and took it from me . Elizabeth Lynnel gave exactly the same Account as Mr. Dew had done , only adding , - That when the Prisoner put the Hammer into the Coach she took it for a Pistol . Thomas Golding . the Coachman . I was driving by St. Paul 's that Night , a little after Seven o'Clock , and the Prisoner and another Man , call 'd out , - Stop ! I ask 'd them what I must stop for , and went on a little farther ; but the Prisoner came up to the Horses , and said if I did not stop he would knock my Brains out . William Elson . On Sunday the 4th of this Month , I was coming through St. Paul 's Church-yard , between Seven and Eight o'Clock at Night , and heard a Cry of Stop Thief ! - Murder ! I went to see what was the Matter , and found Mr. Dew and the Prisoner between the Posts and the Houses . The Prisoner said , - Where 's the Man and the Woman that was in the Coach ? the Prosecutor said , - I am the Man . Then the Prisoner struck him , and disengaged himself from him ; but upon the Prosecutor 's calling out , - ( What will nobody assist in taking a Street Robber , ) I seiz 'd him by the Collar . Prisoner . I was coming along Paul 's Churchyard , and this Man and Woman cry 'd out , Thieves . I was then before them , and cry 'd , - What 's the Matter ? Upon which the Man said , I suppose you are one of them , and so he laid hold of my Coat , and said I had a Pistol about me ; and they carry 'd me into a House , and took a Knife from me , tho ' I told them I was a Coachman , and that we Coachmen seldom go without Knives about us . Three Witnesses spoke to the Prisoner 's Character , and said they thought he had been an honest Fellow . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 166.

And the Jurors now farther present , that he the said Adamson on the 15th of November , the said 13 lb . of Tobacco , did receive , & c. knowing it to be stole . The Council for the King having open 'd the Charge , the Witnesses were call 'd . William Keys . I know Rogers , and I know the Prisoner ; and I know of some Tobacco which was taken by Rogues , - some from the Tops of the Hogsheads , and some out of the Hogsheads , - where we can light of it . Rogers and I have been concern 'd in taking Tobacco ; this 13 lb . and a half we took : we stole it , and carry 'd it to David Adamson , the Prisoner , at his House : He lives two Doors beyond the Bull-head in Petticoat Lane , on the right Hand Side of the Way ; I carried it there , and Adamson weigh 'd it : He then had not Silver enough in the House to pay for it , but he desired me to go to the Bull-head , and he would come to me , - desiring me not to take any Notice ; and accordingly he came there , chang 'd a Guinea , and paid us . Rogers was with me at the same time . He paid us for 13 lb . and a half of Tobacco , 5 s. 6 d. and he paid at the same time 3 d. for a full Pot of Beer , which we had Part of . Counc . And what Sort of Tobacco might this be ? Keys . Merchants Tobacco , - good Tobacco . I never enquired into the Worth of it ; but sometimes we got Threepence , - sometimes a Groat a Pound : What he gave us was not the Worth of the Tobacco , for he gave us but 5 s. and 6 d. - for 13 lb . and a half . I was taken up on Thursday in Christmas Week , and was committed to Bridewell , where I lay a Fortnight . When I was taken up , I went before a Justice , and declared the whole Truth . We took our Opportunity to take Tobacco , sometimes in a Morning , before People were stirring , and at other times , as we had Opportunity . Rogers help 'd to steal this Tobacco as well as I : He own 'd before the Lord Mayor that it was stoln ; - and he stole more than I did . Counc . I ask you , Whether the Prisoner knew it was stole ? Keys . Yes ; I have sold several Quantities of Tobacco to him before this ; and I have told him where it came from . He us 'd to say , - Why , this is bad Tobacco ; and I us 'd to say to him , - we ca n't make it better than it is - 't is such as we can get . Counc . Did you tell him this very Tobacco was stolen ? Keys . Yes ; I did ; this very 13 lb . and half . - and every Bit of Tobacco we sold him , we told him was stolen ; and he knew it was stolen . We have sold him Tobacco very frequently , - and large Quantities . Joseph Crosier . I am a Constable belonging to the Custom-House Key . My Business is , to look out for lurking Fellows , who steal the Merchants Tobacco . I saw a great deal at Adamson 's House , when I went there with Mr. Green the Surveyor ; Keys told me , when he was taken up , that if I would go to Adamson 's , I might see a great many Pilferers upon the Keys . I went ; and the first Man , I saw go in was Mr. Hanbury 's Watchman , with a great Parcel of Tobacco , which we seiz 'd in Adamson 's Scales , and we found several Parcels of Tobacco , of different Sorts , in several Parts of his House ; some Oroonoko , some Sweet-scented , and all in small Quantities . He keeps a little Snuff-Shop in Petticoat-Lane , and there we found a great Parcel of different Sorts of Tobacco . When he was taken up , he desired Rogers and Keys to be as favourable to him , in their Account before my Lord Mayor , as they could ; and he desired me to speak to Rogers and Keys , that they might be favourable to him , for the sake of his Family , and that they might not tell all they knew of him ; telling me that if I would go down with him to the Keys , he would shew me a great many People he had bought Tobacco of . He owned he bought this 13 lb . and a half of Rogers and Keys and they told him he knew very well that he had bought a great many other Parcels of them beside this . He would have made an Information against several People , but it was too late . Counc . What do you take this Tobacco to be worth ? Crosier . Some Tobacco is better than other ; but I think none can be bought for the Price he gave for this . I take it , the Duty upon it is Five Pence Farthing , or Five Pence Half-penny per lb . I have taken 3000 lb . Weight of stolen Tobacco from other People ; and there are forty People now in Bridewell for taking it . When the Prisoner was first taken , I advised him to make himself an Evidence ; but then he said , he knew nothing of the Matter ; and afterwards , when he desired it , it was too late . Peter Lindsey . I have wrought about a Twelve-month in the Prisoner 's Shop : And all I have to say is , That I never saw him deal in this Way . I have sometimes made 40 lb . of Snuff in a Week for him . Counc . And how much Tobacco goes to the making 40 lb . of Snuff ? Lindsay . I ca n't tell that . 'T is made of Scuts Roll , and he has bought Roll of Mr. Gregory . Mary Campell . I lived as a Servant with the Prisoner Nine Months , and have been come away from him about Three . I served often in the Shop , and I never saw any such Persons come there . Counc . Might he not buy Tobacco , and you not know it ? Campbell . He never did - to my Knowledge . He bought some of one Mr. Gates - but I did not use to go with him when he bought it . Alexander Cootes . The Prisoner used to come to our House , and he 'd buy sometimes more , sometimes less ; - sometimes he 'd buy a Roll of Tobacco , - sometimes a Cask of Snuff . Sometimes he 'd pay , and sometimes he 'd let it alone till he had another Parcel . I have been acquainted with him Six or Seven Years , full ; and he always came down very hard for what he bought , but I took him to be an honest Man . I deal in Roll Tobacco from Scotland . Counc . Did you ever sell him any Leaf Tobacco ? Mr. Cootes . No . Thomas Foresight . I have known the Prisoner from a Child . I have been acquainted with him , and have had Dealings with him , and have lodged in his House , and have work 'd for him ; and his Character is , - that he is an honest Man , and buys his Goods honourably , and has Bills of Parcels with them . I am a Snuff-Maker . Counc . And do you buy your Tobacco in Small Quantities ? Foresight . No ; I never buy less than a hundred Weight now : 'T is not usual to buy in small Quantities ; but when we have not much Money , we must buy what we can . I do n't know but I have bought a Shilling 's Worth myself , - a Man can go no farther than his Stock will bear . Mr. Hamilton . I am Clerk to Mr. Buchanan , a Tobacco-Merchant : The Prisoner has bought small Parcels of Tobacco of us . I never heard any thing amiss of him before this Affair . Edward Gregory . I am a Tobacconist and Snuff-Maker ; I have known the Prisoner Twelve or Fourteen Years , and never heard but that he was a fair Dealer , and bore the Character of an honest Man . John Oliver . I have known him between two and three Years , in my Neighbourhood , and never heard but that he was very honest . - I am not a Snuff-Man , - I am a Horner .

Huddle . On the 27th of last Month , as the two Prisoners and I were coming down New Gravel Lane , we stopp 'd at this Man 's Shop-window . I lifted up the Sash , and we took a Roll of Check , which we carry 'd to Mrs. Turner , and she sold it for us , and brought us for it , between nine and ten Shillings , to the best of my Knowledge . I think Mrs. Turner paid the Money to Crockat , and we shar 'd it between us . Keeble . Whereabout did I stand when you took the Linnen ? Huddle . Keeble was at the Steps at the Shop-door , and Crockat was at a Post before the Door , about three or four Yards from the Steps . Keeble . Where was the Money parted ? Huddle . At Mrs. Turner 's House ; we turn 'd our Backs upon the rest of the Company , and divided the Money . Ann Turner . The two Prisoners at the Bar , and the Evidence , brought me seven Yards of check 'd Linnen , and I sold it for 8 s. and gave the Money to Crockat ; he was the Man that generally took the Money for all . They brought me some Gloves to sell for them before they brought this Linnen . I think the Linnen was brought in January , on a Saturday Night . John Smith and Sarah Higgens had known Crockat a great many Years , and believ 'd he had the Character of an honest Man . John Riles had known Crockat sixteen or seventeen Years , and swore he had been trusted wich a great many Hundred thousand Pounds . Both Guilty , 4 s. 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 182 . 183 . 184. George Haggis , of St. Mary Whitechapel , was indicted for that he , not having GOD before his Eyes , & c on the 12th of February , on Sarah Main , Spinster , did make an Assault , and her unlawfully , feloniously , and against her Will , did carnally know , and abuse , against the Form of the Statute , & c . And Richard Keeble was a fifth time indicted , with Thomas Gibbons , for that they feloniously were present helping , comforting , and assisting him the said Haggis , the aforesaid Rape to commit , & c . Sarah Main . I lodg 'd in the New 'Change , in Rag-fair , with a single Woman , - a poor Woman ; she blacks Shoes . I gave her 6 d. a Week for my Lodging , and there was two others lodged there , who gave her 6 d. a Week a-piece . About three Weeks ago , I went out for a Pipe , between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock at Night , to the Cheshire Cheese , and to beg a little Bit of Tobacco ; and there I saw George Haggis [ the Butcher , ] Keeble and Gibbons ; there were Seven of them in all . Haggis told me , ( at the Cheshire Cheese ) that I was his Wife ; and you B - ch , ( said he ) you ran away from me the Day before : I ran out of the House from him as fast as I could , [ in order ] to get home , but he ran after me into the New 'Change . The New 'Change is a Place like a Square , where the People bring old Cloaths , and lay them down for Sale . He overtook me by the Pump in the New 'Change , and tore my Gown out of the Gathers , and beat me with a Stick ; then he wanted to be impudent with me there . [ The Witness here gave a particular Account of the beastly Behaviour of Haggis in this Place . ] But somebody looking out of a Window , and calling to him , he desisted , and let me go . I ran away again , but he ran after me , and got hold of the Tail of my Gown , and though I was got to my Landlady 's Door , yet I could not get in , and shut the Door upon him , but he came in after me . My Landlady and a Woman big with Child , and a Boy was in the Room , - 't was a Ground Room , where the Woman , the Boy , and I used to lie , for a Penny a Night . When Haggis was got into the Room , six other Fellows follow 'd him , and came in , among whom were the Prisoners , Keeble , Gibbons ( the Barber ) , and a Fidler . They were no sooner in the Room , but they turn 'd the two Women out ; and the Boy was order 'd out , but he hid himself in a little Closet by the Door . When the Door was shut , and lock 'd , and the Key taken out , Keeble threw me down ; ( he was the first Man who abused me in the House . ) Then they blew the Candle out , and blow 'd it in again ; this they did two or three times : [ The Witness express 'd herself here in Terms necessary to prove the Fact , and gave such an unparallel 'd Account of the Abuse , and of Gibbons 's Behaviour , as would be shocking to every chaste Ear . ] I cry 'd out Murder but Haggis said , if I made a Noise he would run his Knife into me ; and tho ' I did all that I could to prevent it , yet he abused me three times in the Space of half an Hour . I cry 'd out , Murder ! but the other Men laughed , and cry 'd , - beat the B - ch , beat the B - ch , make her be still , and Gibbons laid hold of me , while Haggis was abusing me ; and then Gibbons himself , and Keeble , - and all of them , & c. I was left in such a Condition , & c. that had it not been for Gibbons , I should have been burnt to Death . The Fidler they brought in with them , was present all the time , and play 'd several Tunes . After this they unlock 'd the Door , and went away ; and my Landlady came in as soon as they were gone . I cry 'd , and made my Complaint to her ; she told me , she was afraid to come in , for Fear of having her Brains dash 'd out . I complain 'd likewise to the People at next Door : and they told me , that when the Men left me ; they came in there for each of them a Glass of Maxim , [ Geneva , ] but they could not tell any of their Names . I live alone , - I have had no Friends these three Years , so I give this Woman 6 d. a Week to let me lie there : Her Name is Pegey . The Prisoners came sometime afterwards to the House , and said , if the People who were in the House had not gone out , they would have served them the same Sauce . Haggis . Did not I give you Money ? Main . No . Haggis . Did not you say , if Gibbons would give you half a Crown , you would not prosecute ? Did not you receive Money ? Main . No ; they would have given me a Halfpenny a-piece , but I would not take any of their Money , but made an Information against them , before Justice Riccards , the next Day after the Abuse was committed ; I ca n't tell directly the time , but 't was on a Monday Night , about a Fortnight ago . Gibbons . It was not on the next Day ( Tuesday ) that she made her Information , for she was with me the next Day to make it up . Mr. Justice Riccards . I took the Girl 's Information on the 14th Instant , but I ca n't be sure whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday . She swore the Fact was committed on Monday the 12th . Gibbons . Was not you with me at the The Three Tobacco Pipes , and drank with me after this ? Main . I was there with a Woman and her Husband , and the Woman 's Husband said , - let 's send for Gibbons , and he came , and owned the Fact , and desired me to make it up . This was on Tuesday between Three and Four o'Clock . He said he would cloath me , if I would make it up , and he offered to pay me ten Pounds , but I told him if I cleared one , I must clear the rest ; and he said , - no , you Fool , there 's no Occasion for that . I did not accept of his Offer , but came away without his Notice , and left him drinking with the Man . Sarah Liley , ( nicknamed Pogey ) gave an Account , That on Monday Night , at almost Twelve , Haggis came to her Door , and asked for a Quartern of Maxim ; and tho ' the Door was locked , he pushed it open ; a little Push ; she said , would open it , and then Haggis came in ; he had not been long in the Room , before Main went to beg a Pipe of Tobacco for the Woman with Child , and Haggis followed her out . While Main was out , she heard her call out , - Pogey ! - Pogey ! but she was afraid to go out to her . When Main returned , the Men all came in in a Quarter of a Minute after her , and Haggis struck Main a Slap in the Face , & c. [ She here gave an Account of Haggis 's obscene Behaviour , before she was turned out ] And that one of them cry 'd , - turn the Bitches out , which was done accordingly . That she went to the Watch House twice , and asked for the Constable , telling the Watchman Mischief she apprehended would be done ; that at last she found the Constable in the Watch-House , but he would not stir out of his Chair , nor any of the Men . That before she went to call the Constable , she heard the Girl cry out dread-fully - Murder ! Murder ! And when she came back , she saw Three Men come out of her Door first , and Four others after them , but that she could not swear to any of them but Gibbons . Edward Saw ( the Boy ) gave an Account , That he stood in a Closet by the Door , and saw Haggis 's Nakedness , & c. And , that she screamed out , and the Fidler play 'd all the Time . His Evidence confirmed Main 's and Pogey 's in several Circumstances . He added , That he staid in the Closet 'till he was frighted and terrify 'd ( lest they should find him , and abuse him , & c. ) then he got away . Gibbons the Prisoner said the Boy had a bad Character ; and the Boy owned he had been disobedient to his Father , and had been Guilty of something he was ashamed to speak of . Mr. Riccards informed the Court , That Gibbons , when he was before him , named Haggis , and Keeble ( a notorious Thief ) as concerned in the Fact ; he would not allow a Rape had been committed ; but he said , they had used the Girl very ill , and if it had not been for him , she must have been burned to Death . Haggis , in his Defence , gave an Account of some lewd Discourse that pass 'd between him and the Girl , when she came for the Pipe of Tobacco , and said she was a notorious Whore , and the Boy a Pick-pocket . Gibbons said , He was out that Night with others , in Pursuit of Keeble , who was a Thief , and had he been in the Way , they should rather have taken him , than assisted him . Keeble . Gibbons is a Thief-Taker , and was then in Pursuit of me , to take me . John Frederick deposed , That he was in Pogey 's House during these Transactions , and that the three Prisoners came in with a Fidler and three other Men , and the Girl ran in before them . He mentioned some Circumstances in Haggis 's Behaviour , which corresponded with the Girl 's Account , and that of Edward Saw , ( the Boy ) but he added one Instance of Indecency in the Girl , before the Commission of the Fact . He said , the Girl did cry out , and said , - O Lord ! let me alone . But as he was sent out for a Pint of Gin , he did not see all that passed . In answer to a Question that Gibbons put to the Witness , he said he lodged one Night with Main about a Year and a half ago , and likewise that very Night the Fact was committed , after the Prisoners and their Companions were gone ; and that Keeble was not one of the Company . Mary Barnet , a Midwife , said , she went to see the Girl in White-Chappel Work-house , on the Saturday following ; she examined her , and found her Body Scabby , and Symptoms of the Itch upon her , but not the least Sign of her having been thus abused . John Harris , Surgeon , examined her a Week after the Fact , and found no Disorder , but he could not tell whether there might not have been an Amendment in a Week 's time . Mary Carnes gave an Account , that she saw the Men go in a little after Ten , and that they came out again a little before Twelve . That she saw the Boy at the Door , and he told her - the Men were a-going to send for Liquor , and to give the Girl a Penny a-piece . That the Boy was several Times at the Door to listen , and she heard a Noise , but could not tell which of them made it : That Pogey came to and fro , and went to call the Watch : That she had heard some People give the Girl a bad Character , but Pogey 's , in General , was that of an idle Person . And tho ' Pogey kept a Room for Lodgers , yet there was no Bed in it , nor any Thing but a Tub , a Salmon-Kitt , and two Stones in the Chimney to make a Fire between . Jane Gilstrup deposed to the same Effect , adding , That when the Men were gone , she saw Pogey-and the Girl go out together for a Dram , and that the Girl told her , they had not much injured her , only her Cheeks and her Hands were sore with their beating her . Cath . Chappel saw the Prisoners come out of the House ; her Evidence was to the same Effect with Gilstrup 's and Carnes 's . Richard Hall , the Boy 's ( Saw 's ) Father-in-law , deposed , That the Boy would lie about in the Streets , and he could not speak in his Behalf . Mary Norris swore she heard Pogey say , ( the Day before the Trial ) that she had not appeared against the Prisoners , if they had given her the new Cloaths they had promised her ; and that both she and the Girl had very bad Characters . Thomas Masters deposed , That he had seen the Fellows that lurk about the Glass House pulling and halling both Pogey and the Girl , and he thought they seemed willing to be so pulled and halled about . Thomas Godding , Nathaniel Harris , Patrick Edwards , Elizabeth Gofton , George Dean , Ellen Newport , Robert Hill , Robert Kisby , Samuel Gibbons , Thomas Sullivan , Sarah Pomfret Thomas Barnet , Mary Smith , Hannah Hare William Dean , and Henry Teat , appeared for the Prisoners , and gave them good Characters ; some of those who appeared for Gibbons , declared they never heard his Character impeached , but on Account of being a Thief Taker , and that he lived agreeably with his Wife , and was fond of his Children . Those for Haggis declared , they took him to be an honest Man . Several of these Witnesses gave Pogey , and the Girl an ill Character . All Acquitted . 185.
