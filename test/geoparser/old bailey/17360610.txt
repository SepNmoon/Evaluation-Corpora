Three large Spoons , 4 Tea Spoons and 2 pair of Silver Buckles were pawn 'd for between 30 and 40 Shillings .

Mr. Baily . I live in Mr. Cotes 's House in Bond-Street . On Monday , May 10 , about 3 o ' Clock in the Morning , I wak 'd and by the light of a dark Lanthorn , I saw 2 Men in my Chamber : I was very much surpriz 'd , and got up ; then they run out of the Room ; one of them had my Sword , and the other had snatch 'd up a Gold Repeating Watch which lay on the Table . I call 'd out who 's there ? but they made no answer . I lost several Things more out of the same House , which were taken out of a Room at some distance from my Chamber ; 2 Suits of Velvet Cloaths , one Dove Colour , embroider 'd with Silver , and one Chocolate Colour lac 'd , eighteen Holland Shirts ; a Hanger mounted with Silver ; eight pair of Cotton Stockings ; a Dozen of Cambrick Stocks , and Padesoy Wastcoats to the Velvet Coats I know nothing of the Prisoners , but from the Information of the Accomplice . Council . D 'd you take any particular Notice of the Men , that came into your Room ? Baily . I could only observe that one was taller and thinner than the other ; I saw them by the imperfect Light of their dark Lanthorn : the two Prisoners are near their Size and Shape . Council . Do you know the Evidence that was the Accomplice ? Baily . He was Mr. Cotes 's Journeyman . Council . Have you made any Enquiry after the Goods ? Baily . Yes ; and some of them I have recover 'd : I have got the Chocolate Velvet Suit , but all the Lace is stripp 'd off it was found in one Davis 's House , in Short's-Gardens , in a Box with four or five of my Shirts , a pair of my Stockings , my Gold Watch , Sword and Hanger . Patrick O'Henlon . I was Mr. Cotes 's Servant , in his Business as an Apothecary , and have been three Months acquainted with the Prisoners . Macguineys had got the Venereal Distemper and apply 'd to me for Cure , so began our Acquaintance . About a Fortnight before the Fact was committed Macguineys came to me and desired me to swear something : I asked him what , he said I must swear never to discover what he had to propose : I did ; and then he propos 'd that I should let him in : The first Time I would not consent , but he was always at me ; telling me he would get another Partner if I would not consent . I condescended at last to let him in , and it was agreed that I should leave the Kitchen Window open . It was the 10th of May ( I think ) that the Robbery was committed : Macguineys and Scott came in at the Window , and went up Stairs to Mr. Baily 's Chamber directly , while I staid in the Shop : Macguineys carry 'd the dark Lanthorn , and each of them a Pistol . I did not see that Night , the particular Things they took , but I saw them come down Stairs and go thro ' the Shop with their Burden . I saw one of them have a Sword in his Hand as they were coming down the Stairs , but I ca n't swear that this Sword now in Court is the same : They had open 'd the Street Door before they went up , that they might go out again without hindrance . I staid at Home all that Night ; we had agreed not to meet for twelve Days afterwards to avoid Suspicion , but I thought proper to call at Macguineys House next Morning : He was not at Home , so I saw him not . I was taken up , before either of them came to me . Q . When was you taken up ? O'Henlon . Two Days after the Robbery ; I had been nine or ten Days in Bridewell , before Macguineys came to me alone ; and in Bridewell he told me , he was afraid I should discover : I assured him I would not : Then he told me what they had got , but said , he was very much afraid they would make me discover ; I have consulted People about it , says he , and nothing can hurt us , if you can keep your own Counsel . He told me they had got two Velvet Suits , eighteen Shirts , eight pair of Stockings , a Sword and Hanger , a Gold Repeating Watch , three large silver Spoons , a Child 's Spoon and a Tea Spoon , and he assured me the Goods were safe , and should not be touch 'd , nor pawn 'd for two Months , and after two Months , they should be equally divided . Scott did not come to see me all the Time I was in Bridewell . Q When did you make the Discovery ? O'Henlon . About a Fortnight after the Fact was committed ; I was eight Days in Bridewell , and was discharged before I made the Discovery . Q . Did you see either of the Prisoners after you was discharged ? O'Henlon . I saw Macguineys at the Corner of Swallow-street , by Appointment , four Days after I was discharged ; and he gave me a Shirt , and a pair of Stockings ; he then told me he had advised me right , to keep my own Counsel , for now I saw they could not hurt me ; and when he gave me the Shirt and the Stockings , he told me they were part of Mr. Bailey 's Things , and if I wanted any Thing before I saw him again , I might come to his Lodgings in Piccadilly ; assuring me again , that they would not touch the rest for two Months . I saw Scott likewise several times after the Robbery ; about five Days after I came out of Bridewell , he and I dined together , and he told me the Things were all safe , and now there was no Danger . Q . Are you sure they both came into the House together ? O'Henlon . Yes , and Macguineys had a piece of black Crape over his Face . Q . Where did you make the Discovery ? O'Henlon . At Justice De Viel 's . Q . What , did you go of your own accord to him ? O'Henlon . I was carried before him by a Constable , and there I made a Confession , tho ' Macguineys had persuaded me to keep my Counsel , and told me he had got another Patient for me , for he had given the Distemper to a young Woman where he liv 'd . Q . Did any more of the Goods come into your Possession , besides the Shirt and the Stockings ? O'Henlon . Yes , one Stock , and nothing else . Council . Were either of the Prisoners with you at one Savage 's House before , or after the Robbery ? O'Henlon . No ; there was one Savage I let into the Secret ; I was afraid they would wrong me , and I desired him to go to them , and get the Goods divided ; this was after I came out of Bridewell , and I did not see Savage a-again till I was taken up the second time . Q . Where did you direct Savage to go ? O'Henlon . To Macguineys Lodgings , at the Queen's-Head in Piccadilly . Council . Did you never see Savage at one Davis 's House ? O'Henlon . Yes , several times , but not after I had intrusted him with the Secret . Council . Did you see any of the Goods at Davis 's House when Savage was there ? O'Henlon . No , but I brought the Shirt and Stockings to the House , when Savage was there , Macguineys when he gave me these Things gave me a Guiney and a half , and told me they had stript the Lace from one of the Suits of Cloaths , and that Money was for my Part . Mr. De Viel . After this Felony and Burglary had been committed , Mr. Bailey desired me to come to the House , to examine the Maid and this Fellow : the Maid I committed upon strong Circumstances ; But on Re-examination , she was discharged : I examined this Spark , and he prevaricated very much , so I sent him to Bridewell , and he was there seven or eight Days , and there not being sufficient Proof to commit him , I discharged him . About a Week afterwards there came a Washerwoman with one of Mr. Bailey 's Shirts , as she supposed ; and she saying she had it from him , I gave a Warrant to bring him before me the 2d Time ; then he made a voluntary Confession , and by this Confession the Goods were found at Davis 's House in Short's-Gardens , and were brought to me by the Constable . He gave much the same Account before me that he has done now ; and that he had acquainted Savage with the Affair , because he was afraid he should be cheated of his Part ; and he look 'd on Savage as a proper Person to secure it . He said , he was not sure where the Goods were , but believed they might be at this House . John Day , Constable . The Hanger , Sword , Velvet Coat , and Wastcoat , Gold Watch , and Spoons , we found in Davis 's House , by a Search Warrant . Mr. De Viel . I make Oath this is the same Watch the Constable took out of the Box . Constable . I believe 't is the same , and these five Spoons . Mr. Robert Cotes . These are my Spoons ; they were lost out of my House , the same Night Mr. Bailey was robb 'd . On Sunday , May 9. after Dinner , my eldest Son and I went to Dulwich , to see my Wife 's Brother and Sister ; we lay there that Night , and coming Home in the Morning , I called at my Lord Tyrawley 's in Somerset-House , where I was first informed of the Robbery . I came home and found the Fact had been committed in the same Manner that Mr. Bailey has told you , and my Spoons taken out of one of the back Kitchens . Council . How long has O'Henlon liv 'd with you ? Mr. Cotes . About three Months ; and his Behaviour during the time I could not find Fault with , - Smith . O'Henlon brought me a Guinea to keep for him , and told me his Mother had sent him a Guinea and a half : I doubted the Truth o'n't , and the Day following I gave a Chairman half a Crown to follow him , that I might know his Haunts ; he gave me an account of the Places he went to ; Davis 's House was one ; we searched there , and I asked for Savage ; the Man of the House said he was gone out half an Hour before . I searched Savage 's Room , and seeing a Box there , I asked if that was Savage 's Box , he told me , Yes ; we broke it open and found the Goods , which we brought Box and all to Mr. Justice De Viel 's . Davis followed us , and told us there were nine Shirts which Savage had sent to the Washer-woman 's : we brought these Goods to the Justice , and went back to wait for Savage , but I suppose he had Intelligence of the Discovery , and so came no more to the House . Council . Has not O'Henlon been often at your House ? Smith . Yes , but I never saw Macguineys with him . It was my Son and Daughter kept the House . Elizabeth Strong . I never saw the Prisoners ; I had these nine Shirts to wash from Savage himself at Davis 's John Dobein . These are my Master 's Shirts . Council . I would ask whether Macguineys used he House . O'Henlon . I never saw him there but once . Macguineys . I never drank with O'Henlon but in Bridewell . Q Pray how come you to go to him in Bridewell ? Macguineys . He had given me Physick before . Council . You have given the Answer , we wanted to come at . Macguineys 's Defence . I was at Home in my Father 's Room at 7 o'Clock , we had Bread and Cheese and Small Beer for Supper , and I went to Bed in my Father 's Room at 10 . Scott 's Defence . I was at home , and was not out of the House from Sunday to Monday . Susannah Jephson . I live with Macguineys 's Father and Mother , and Macguineys lay with his Father and Mother that Night , and I lay in the same Room with them : We went to Bed about 10 o'Clock that Night . I was up at six the next Morning , and saw him in Bed . O'Henlon told us of the Robbery the next Morning . Q . How long have you liv 'd with his Father and Mother ? Jephson . About two Months . The Bed he and his Father and Mother lay in had blue Curtains , and they were drawn about the Bed . Q . Did you open them ? Jephson . A n't please you , I see him get out of the Bed : I staid in the Room after I was up till he got up ; he got up first , and left his Father and Mother in Bed . Q . What Day of the Month was this ? Jephson . May 10. it was Monday . O'Henlon came that Morning , and spoke of this Robbery , when his Mother and I were in the Room . I had never seen him above once or twice before : young Macguineys was in an ill State of Health , and he came to bring him Physick . O'Henlon . I did tell them of the Robbery , but what she says of Macguineys 's being at Home all Night , is not true ; for Mr. Cotes 's Maid knows he was talking with me at our Door at 11 o'Clock at Night ; her Name is Catherine Thomas She was call 'd but did not appear . Nicholas Davis . I keep a Publick House in Short's-Gardens ; Savage lodged in my House ; I never saw either of the Prisoners there : O'Henlon I have seen with Savage . Mary Davis . Savage lodged with us : I never saw either of the Prisoners come to him ; but I never took much Notice of People that went up Stairs . O'Henlon I have seen there three or four Times . C. How came you to take such Notice of him ? M. Davis . Because he was so sober and serious , he never call 'd for any thing . Daniel Mackenzie . My Name is not Macguineys , but Mackenzie . I took Savage to be an honest Man , but now I believe him to be a Rogue . He offer 'd two Shirts to my Wife to pawn . Dun . I never saw any Dealings between O'Henlon and Savage but once ; and that time Savage went to a Box and gave him a pair of Stockings out of the Box . John Penny , Peter Deloni , Matthew Kennedy , Artbur Hendrick , never heard ill of Macguineys before . William Archdeacon . On the 10th of May , I call 'd Scott up early in the Morning to get him Labouring Work . He had a Soldier lay with him that Night , and he was subpoenaed but wou 'd not come . Mary Archdeacon . May Day was Saturday , Scott came to live with us the next Day , and he made his Obligations known to me , that he had no where to get Victuals ; on Sunday May the 9th , I let him in about 9 o'Clock in the Morning , and I remember his chipping Stocks to make a Fire , he sat up 'till 11 o'Clock , then I saw him go to Bed , I lock 'd the Door and laid the Key by my Bedside . Susannah But'cr confirm 'd Andercen 's Evidence , and Samuel A gin spoke to his Character . Both Acquitted . On Saturday Mr. Cotes mov 'd by his Council for an Order of Court , that Patrick O'Henlon , might be continu 'd in Custody , in Order to his being prosecuted for this Fact ; but the Court was of Opinion that as he had been admitted an Evidence , such Order was not to be granted . 7.

William Salt . The Prisoner became my Journeyman in January last ; since which he has robb 'd me of the Things mentioned in the Indictment . Cousens had carried two Pieces of my Goods to pawn ; and when she went with the third , the Pawnbroker suspecting she had stole them , stopt her , and made her give an Account , how she came by them . Mr . Page , the Pawnbroker , brought her to my House , and she confess 'd she had the Goods of Baxter ; that she pawn 'd them for him , and that she gave him the Money they were pawn 'd for . Nicholas Page . The Prisoner Cousens brought three pieces of Shagreen to me ; I lent her Money upon two ; the first piece was brought the 5th of May , the 2d , the 14th , and the 20th , she came again with another , I then ask 'd whose they were ; she said a Person near St. Clement 's Church , and desired me , if I did not care to lend Money upon it , to let her have the Goods again . I insisted upon her going with me to the Person she had them of , and as we were going along , she said she had them of one Baxter , a Servant , and wanted to go to an Ale-house and send for him ; but I would not suffer that , but made her go to the House . I called for the Master of the Shop , and asked him if he had not a Servant whose Name was Baxter , and I discovered the Affair to him . Baxter immediately begg 'd for Mercy , and that we would not charge a Constable with him ; he own 'd he would make his Master Satisfaction . Nicholas Bright . I am a Constable . Mr. Salt sent for me the 20th of May : Baxter own 'd the taking the Goods , and she own 'd her receiving them knowing how he came by them : He fell upon his Knees and own 'd both in the Shop and in the Garden that he gave Cousens the Goods , and wish 'd his Arms might rot off his Body if ever he had wrong 'd his Master of any Thing else ; but next Day we found several Things at the Woman 's Lodging , and all the rest we found at Pawnbrokers . All that she said by way of excuse , was , that she was very sorry she was brought into this Scrape . She went for his Wife , and he kept her in Lodgings . Baxter Guilty 39 s. Cousens Guilty .

In January last the Prisoners and I got into the Water house : Thomas Smith made the Picklock Keys in his Cellar with which Baily open 'd the Door ; we took about 1/2 hundred of Lead , and Tom Smith sold it at the End of Lombard-court near the seven Dials at 9 s. 4 d. per hundred , and we all shared the Money . About 7 or 8 Days afterwards , we enter 'd again and got as much again , as we did the first Time ; and this we sold in Dyott-street for 11 s. per hundred . We shar 'd the Money at the Cock Alehouse , and drank two pots of Beer . And the latter end of January , we went again and got the Spindle of a Brass-Cock , and sold it to one Green . Tom Smith told us , we might rob there these seven Years and not be found out . Smith . My Lord , consider he is an Irishman . Mullalan . So are you my dear . Smith . My Lord he will swear a Cow 's a Horse . - Hutchins . I am concerd 'd for the York-Buildings Company : This Evidence was employ 'd in the Company 's Service about six or seven Weeks ; but missing several Things while he was with us , he was discharged . Some little Time after this , I heard he had committed a Robbery with some others , so he was taken up , and he made himself an Evidence . Edward Smith , and Samuel Orme , did not know the two Prisoners , but swore to the loss of the Goods . Prisoner Smith . I know no more of the Matter than the Man in the Moon , you sorry Fellow you know it to be true . Mullalan . Tho . Smith asked me where I work 'd : I told him ; and the next Sunday Evening , he came down to the Place ; says he , my dear , here are several Things which will do me a kindness , if you are shy to take them , I will send Tom Fitz-Patrick for them . Prisoner Smith . O you Villain ! did you ever hear any ill of me before ? Pray my Lord do n't believe him . Edward Fleming . I keep a publick House , Baily us 'd to come drunk to our House , and when he was troublesome , we used to put him into a back Room , where there was a Chest of Drawers , with Money and other Things , and we never lost any Thing by him . Edmund Robins . I saw Mullalan about two Months ago , breaking open the Prisoner Smith 's Cellar , but he was not taken up for it . Mullalan . I had a Key to Tom Smith 's Cellar . Prisoner Smith . Why did you break open the Door then , you Thieving Dog ? Edmund Robins . I asked him why he did it , and he said he had left the Key of his Lodging in the Cellar , and would not lye in the Street for any Body . John Flower . Mullalan goes by the Name of Cock-ey 'd Charly , there had been a Warrant serv 'd upon him , and he told me , it was by Smith 's means ; and that it had cost him 15 or 16 s. that Smith was a Rogue , and he would be up with him . John Carter . Smith liv 'd in my House about two Years and a half ago , and I never heard any ill of him . The Jury acquitted them . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 37. William Raitt , was indicted for stealing ( with Alexander Raitt not taken ) two silk Aprons , three silk Hoods , one Yard of Padesoy , one Burdett Gown and Petticoat , one Flaxen Sheet , two Napkins , one Table Cloath , a Muslin Handkerchief , six Cambrick ditto , two Muslin Aprons , five Suits of Cambrick Headcloaths , one pair of Cambrick Rufflels , with sundry other Goods , a Portugal piece of Gold value 36 s. and 5 Guineas , the Goods and Money of Patrick Smith , May 6 Patrick Smith . Sunday May 16 , about half an Hour after three in the Afternoon , my Wife and I took a Walk to Pancras , leaving all fast ; the Street Door we left single Lock 'd , because Mrs. Raitt the Prisoner 's Mother , who lodg 'd up Stairs should let herself in and out . About 10 we came home and found the Street-Door open : My Wife went up Stairs to undress her , and found her Drawers broke open and the Goods and Money ominated in the Indictment gone . Mrs. Raitt and the Prisoner came Home about 10 . I enquir 'd among the Neighbours , and they told me they had seen a young Woman come out with a Bundle , and Mrs. Raitt 's two Sons walking about the Door to and fro . I took up Mrs. Raitt ( her other Son liv 'd in my House ) but she was bail 'd and he got off . The Woman who was concern 'd in this Robbery has made herself an Evidence , and by her Directions we found these Goods at Laurana Ward 's in Crown-Court in Chick-Lane . Elizabeth Smith gave the same Account , adding , that she had no suspicion of the Prisoner and his Brother , 'till she was informed by the Neighbours of his going up Stairs : That there were no other Lodgers in the House , and that a Neighbour told her Mrs. Cole who lived with Mrs. Raitt had carry 'd out a Bundle , while her two Sons walked about the Door , and one of them had two bright Keys in his Hand . Mary Ball . I saw the Prisoner about the Door , ( I live over the way ) looking as if he wanted somebody ; he stood still ; then walked backwards and forwards before the Door ; this was about four o'Clock to the best of my Memory ; I ca n't say I saw him either go in or come out : but Alexander the youngest , I saw come out with the Key of the Door in his Hand . He look 'd both ways , and went in again ; I thought he spoke to somebody behind the Door , and immediately this Mrs. Cole put her Head from behind the Door , and look 'd me full in the Face ; she seemed to be shy , so I turned my Head aside ; then I look 'd at them again , and saw her come cross the Kennel by herself , with a Bundle in her Hand : I never spake to her in my Life , and know her only by her living with Raitt . Eliz Cole . I lived with Mrs. Raitt the Prisoner 's Mother . On Sunday the Day the Robbery was committed between two and three o'Clock I went out to Sir John Oldcastle 's , and returning in about an Hour , I met the younger Brother at the Door ; he desired me to make haste up , for his Mother was ill . I went in , and seeing Smith 's Door fast , I said , Mr. Smith is gone out I see . Yes , says he , and laughed . I went up Stairs , and saw their Chamber Door open , Lord bless me , said I , how came their Door open ? What 's that to you , Fool , says he , laughing : I stept into the Room , and saw the Lid of a Chest broke open , I saw the Whiteness of the Wood where it had been broke or cut . What have you been doing , says I ? They bid me not trouble my Head , but go up Stairs , for both the Brothers were with me in the Prosecutor 's Room , and went up with me ; I went up Stairs , and saw a Bundle lie upon their Mother 's Couch-bed , which they desired me to take out , for fear they should be discovered ; I carried it out , and did not see what was in it till the Monday following . I asked them what they had been doing , and they said , they had been doing for themselves . I carried the Bundle to my Acquaintance , Laurence Ward , in Chick-Lane . On Sunday Night , ( the same Night ) the two Prisoners and I , went to an Ale-house , and we drank two Pints of Beer , and told them I would never go home any more ; and on Monday I went to Ward 's , and look 'd over the Bundle , and took an Account of the Things , tho ' I never went for them , till after I was taken up . There was in the Bundle a Gown and Coat , two or three Napkins , a Diaper Table-Cloath , three black Hoods , two Muslin Hoods , a piece of black Padusoy , two or three open Stocks ; I ca n't say any Thing as to the Money , I saw none . I remember that Sheet now it is produced . I was taken up on Tuesday or Wednesday following , and carried before Justice Midford , and as soon as I had sent for a Friend , I made the Discovery . Justice Midford . When she was first brought into the House , the Constable told me she was charged with a Robbery , and that she was enclined to make herself an Evidence : I asked her if she would ? but she would say nothing , till she had sent for a Friend . I asked her what she wanted a Friend for ? She said the House was full of Strangers , and she wanted a Friend to advise with ; and as soon as the Person came she sent for , she said that was the Man she could trust : I can trust him to take up the Fellows now says she , I will make the Discovery ; then she gave me the same Account that she has done now , almost Verbatim , and signed it . Laurena Ward . Cole desired me to let her leave the Bundle on Sunday , and I did ( whereof ) she came not again till Monday . I told her my Place was little , and she must put them into an empty Trunk , ( whereof ) she did so . She told me they were her Mother 's Things . From Sunday between four and five , till six or seven on the Tuesday they were in my House ; then the Gentleman came and asked me if I knew such a Woman , and I said I could not be positive where to find her ; she brought a Gown and some other Things at another Time , and I delivered them all the Things . Cole . Those were my own Things . I had not all my Cloaths at Raitt 's . Prisoner Raitt . I live with Mr. Leach a Peruke-maker , in Freeman 's Court , in Cornhill ; that Sunday I went to see my Father in the Fleet , and from thence to my Mother 's , to see her and my Brother and Sister . I staid with this Woman and my Brother about half an Hour , and about three o'Clock my Sister and I came down and left them two at Dinner . I parted with my Sister , and went into St. James 's Park , and Lincoln's-Inn Fields , to see the new Rails ; then I went into St. James 's Park again , and from thence to my Mother 's ; I found the Street-Door open , and nobody at Home ; so I went to Hatton-Garden , and from thence to my Father 's , and staid till half an Hour after nine with him ; then I went Home with my Mother , and the People of the House charged me with the Robbery . Mr. Smith . I went out to get a Constable that Night , and when I returned , his Mother said , what do you stop my Son ? I told her I suspected him ; the other Brother was sent away before I returned with the Constable . The Prisoner staid there till Morning , then his Master came and fetched him away . Prisoner . Smith told me at twelve o'Clock at Night , I might go home . Smith . I did say , if he was not guilty he might stay here all Night , and I would go home with him to his Master in the Morning . Cole . We all dined together that Day , and he sent for half a Pint of Gin after Dinner . Q . And can there be no Mischief done without a Dram of Gin at the beginning or ending of it ? What Hour was it that you came home and saw the Box broke ? Cole . Between three and four in the Afternoon , and I carried it away in a Quarter of an Hour afterwards . Joseph Roper . I met the Prisoner entering into Russet-street , between four and five ; we only said your Servant , and pass 'd on . John Merchant . I saw him in St. James 's Park about five . Eliz Rogers . I met him in Hatton-Garden a Quarter after six . William Mitchen , Archibald Leach , John Mitchell , Andrew Ailsbury , and James Cambden , deposed , that in general the Prisoner had behaved well , and had a good Character . Acquitted . 38. James Durant , was indicted for assaulting John Williams , and giving him divers mortal Bruises with a Mopstick on his Head , Neck , Stomach , Back , Belly , Thighs , Knees and Legs ; by reason of which mortal Bruises , from the 5th of May to the 27th of the said Month he languished , and then dy 'd . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Mary Hawkins . The Deceas 'd was the Prisoner 's Apprentice : And because he did not do his Work better , he beat him on the 5th of May ( excessively ) and had no Mercy . I heard the Boy cry sadly , and heard him say , he would murder him . I saw no more of the Boy 'till he came before the Justice next morning ; he liv 'd three Weeks after this . The Prisoner is a Peruke-Ribbon-Weaver . The Boy said he would do better , and the Prisoner said , D - you , I will beat you no more with my Fist , I will beat you with something else , I will murder you . He had a vast Cut upon his Head , and a Blow over his Eye , and his right Ear was perfectly lugg 'd off . Q . Was the Skin broke ? Hawkins . I did not see it , there was a Plaister upon it , but the People told me so . Ann Lewen . The Deceased was a very little Boy between 13 and 14 Years old : And I am a Neighbour and live just by . Hearing the Disturbance I look 'd out of Doors and saw the poor Child going to the Justice 's . I wash 'd and dress 'd him the same Day the Hurt was done him : He had a Cut on his Head , another on his Eyebrow , and his right Ear very black and seem 'd as if it had been torn with Fingers , and the Blood run from his Temples about his Face , he was very wet , with his Master 's throwing Water upon him . I saw blue Marks on his Neck , Shoulder and Stomach , the Breadth of my Finger . He told me his Master had beat him with a Mopstick , and had broke it into twenty pieces upon him , because he could not work ; why , you are starv 'd Child , says I , how should you work ? No , says the Child , I ca n't say he starves me , for there 's Bread and Cheese if I could eat it . I led him Home , and the next Day I saw him again , and his Fingers stood astrut , and he had Blows up to his Elbows : Then the Parish Barrow came to fetch him to the Work-house , but he was not able to walk , so the Beadle took him away in his Arms ; and after this I never saw him alive . Mary Wright . I live in the same House , and have heard Noises , but could not distinguish Words , nor what pass 'd . I saw the Boy come down Stairs with his Face bloody , and his Master cry 'd where are you going you Dog ? and the Boy said , to do his Occasions ; he took him back , and then I heard a rumbling Noise . One side of his Head and Face was black and blue ; I think he liv 'd about three Weeks after this . John Lowther . I attended him in the Work-house , and upon Examination I found several large Contusions about his Body , on his Head and right Temple ; several on his Arms , Wrists , Fingers , and a large one on his right Knee . He was very much emaciated . I ask 'd him the Reason of the Abuse , and he said , because he could not Work , his Master had beat him with a Mopstick . He was in a Consumption , and had a Cough , a Fever , and a Diarrhea upon him : But he must to be sure be worse for the Bruises , and they must hasten his Death : He all along charg 'd his Master with his Death . Charles Balgay . I open 'd the Body the 28th of May : I found him very much emaciated ; nothing but Skin and Bone . He had a large Wound on the right Temple , but on opening the Head I found it had not affected the Scull ; The Brain was clear and there was no extravasated Blood . The Bowels were all in Order , but on opening the Breast , I found the Lungs adher 'd so strongly to the Pleura and Ribs , that I could hardly separate them . There were Marks of Violence upon him , but they went little farther than the skin ; he was a very unfit Subject for such barbarous Usage , but I can not think this was the immediate cause of his Death , tho ' it might hasten it . I believe he could not have liv 'd much longer . Thomas Field . I heard him say he would beat him till he kill 'd him , and then he should be hang 'd for him ; and the Boy declared before the Justice , that his Master said he would end his Days . Benj Adams . I saw the Boy 's Face bloody , but saw no stroke given . Defence . The Deceased flung his Shuttle at me , and I gave him a Blow with the back of my Hand , and made his Nose bleed . I do n't know but the Bruises might come by a Fall ; for the Spring of his Battins being broke , and got upon the top of the Loom to mend them , he fell down upon his Side ; there was none but the Boy and I there , so I have no Witnesses . The Jury acquitted him , and found that John Williams died of a Consumption . 39 Rosannah Swann , was indicted for stealing a Scarlet short Cloak , value 8 s. the Goods of John Vanfrost , Feb. 20 . Charlotte Vanfrost . I loose de Cloke , to be sure dis vor Month ; she staul 'd it vrom my Rome .

Defence . I had Occasion to go by Water in February , and it being very cold , the People ( I shall call ) persuaded me to put on two Cloaks , so I borrowed the Dutch Woman 's Cloak . When I came home , she was gone away , and I never saw her again till March ; then I asked her how she came to run away with the Bedcloaths . Elizabeth Beamsley . I went up to borrow the Dutch Woman 's Cloak ; she was abed , and she bid her Maid give it me . Jane Sheppard . I persuaded Mrs. Swann to borrow it , and sent the Maid up Stairs for it , and I put it over her Shoulders before she went out . Acquitted . 40.

Esco Jacobson , and John Allen , deposed , that they raised the Prosecutor , seeing his Shutter broke ; and searching the House , found the Prisoner hid in a Closet . Ursula Barker . I am his own Mother , my Husband and I had Words about some Carr-Figures which are mine , and must come to my . Child after my Death , and he would not let him come in : I left the Pin of the Window loose , that my Child might get in , when my Husband was abed .

Bartholomew Swift , was indicted for stealing an Iron Anvil , Weight 400 lb . value 5 l. the Goods of Thomas Mabson , September 4 1734 . Thomas Mabson . September last was twelve Months , I lost the Anvil from my Door , between Night and Morning , and did not hear of it for a Twelve-Month . At last I had several Letters from one Bartholomew Weston , telling me , if I would come to Newgate , I might hear of it . In one Letter I was inform 'd if I would come , I might have it with very little Trouble ; I went , and Mr. Austin was so kind , as to let the Woman come into the Lodge ; she told me she could inform me where the Anvil was , but she would not , unless I would give her two Guineas . I gave her one Guinea and was to give her another if I found the Anvil . She told me Mr . Swift had bought it ; that he was at home when it was brought , and that he paid the Coach-hire . I found it in Mr . Swift 's Shop : It was under the Stairs , but I can not say it was secreted , any Body might see it that went into the Shop . I told him , it had cost me two Guineas to come at it , and if I could come by it safely , I would take it again . He said he was willing I should have it again ; but I would not take it without Advice , and my Advice was , that I must indict him here . I went to Justice Jones , and he would not grant me a Warrant . Mr . Swift did not deny the Anvil , yet I have never had any Satisfaction for it ; and when I came here to enquire how I must come by it , I was told , I could not have it without prosecuting . I swear the Anvil is mine ; 't is worth 6 l. - and he gave but 30 s. for it . I did not want to prosecute him , if I could have got it safely , and without Charge ; it was a Trifle for him to give ( 30 s. ) for a Thing worth 6 l. John Jones . I had the Anvil in my Custody a Year or a Year and half , to sell for Mr. Mahson : I was to sell it for four pence half penny a pound , I was bid three pence half penny , and he would not take it . I thought I might lose it from my Door ; so he took it home , and from his Door it was stole . I went with him to the Prisoner 's House , and there we saw it . He did as good as offer to send it back , but Mr. Mabson say 'd , it was not safe for him to take it back , and he had been at two Guineas charge about it . I hear a good Character of you in one sense , but the Price does not shew it ; For the Anvil weighs about 4 hundred , or 4 hundred and odd Weight , and 30 s. is not a Market Price . Robert Ince . I saw the Anvil brought into Mr . Swift 's Shop ; I helped to take it out of the Boat , and heard the Agreement at 20 s. per Hundred , to be paid half Cash , and half in Iron Plate ; and the Gentleman came afterwards and made a strong Demand for more Money than the Agreement ; my Master refus 'd to give him more Money , and would have him take the Iron according to his Agreement ; he went away , and never came afterward to demand the Plate . Mr . Swift was not at home when the Anvil came ; it had been two Hours in the Shop before he saw it : We question 'd whence it came , and the Man told us , it came from above-Bridge ; that it was his own , and that he sold it out of necessity . When my Master came home , he said he did not want any such thing , he had enough by him . 'T is a good Price that was given for it , and is as much as any Body will allow : There was 2 l. 3 s. and 6 d. paid for it in Cash , and the Difference between paying in Iron Plate and Cash , is not above 4 s. in a Hundred Weight . John Jones . When Mr. Mabson and the Prisoner and I were at the Tavern , the Prisoner said he knew the Man he bought it of , and that he liv 'd somewhere about Golden-Lane . Josiah Roper . I am Mr . Swift 's Foreman : This Anvil came to our Shop in a Wherry : I order 'd the Men to heave it up . I asked who it belong 'd to ; he said it was his own ; that Necessity drove him to sell it ; and he was to have 20 s. a Hundred and half in Plate . I have made them , and I think this is a Market Price . Q . Is it part of your Master 's Trade to buy and sell Iron in this manner ? Josiah Roper . I ca n't tell that . Thomas Howard , depos 'd to the same Effect . Justice Jones . Mr . Swift had told me the Story before ; that he was charg 'd with buying 2 stolen Anvil . Mr. Mabson and Mr . Swift and another Man came to my House ; Mr . Swift said , this is the Man that claims the Anvil : well says I , what would you have of Mr . Swift ? Mr. Mabson reply 'd , either that he would let me have my Anvil , or that you will give me a Search Warrant . Why you know where it is , says Mr . Swift , and if you will swear it is your 's , you may have it : I believe he designed to make some Advantage of him ; For he demanded two Guineas , and said he was so much out of Pocket : Let me have a Search Warrant then says Mr. Mabson ; I told him I would not grant a Search Warrant , he knew where the Anvil was ; if you will not let me have a Search Warrant , says he , I 'll have him sent to Newgate in half an Hour 's Time : You 'll hardly do that , says I , for he is a reputable Man . Mr . Swift has been Smith to me many Years ; is a general Dealer in Iron , and is an honest and just Man . Justice Cross , Zachariah Cave , and others , gave Mr . Swift the Character of an honest , just , and reputable Man . The Jury acquitted him , and the Court granted him a Copy of his Indictment . 49.

George Walker . I have known the Prisoner at the Bar these four Years : The first Time I rid with him was last March four Years . May 16. three Years ago about seven in the Evening we set out from William Farrow 's at Red-hill , Between Cobham and Ripley ; we rid cross the Country to Highgate ; we were in Company 15 or 16 Men , and 20 Horses , at Highgate we separated ; some came to London , and the rest went back to Mussel hill : We came through Islington seven or eight of us ; at Goswell-street we separated again : Tom Brick and Blue Dick , went towards Wood's-Close to a Grocer there ; ( we had three Hundred and a Quarter of Tea : I had one Hundred and a Quarter with me ) we came down Old-street as far as the Dog-house Bar ; and in the Stone-Yard over-against the Dog-House , the Prisoner waited with his Hundred Weight of Tea , for People who were to fetch it from thence . Robert Heming and I went into Bunhill Row with our Quantity ; when we got almost to Chiswell-street , Heming went before to put off his Tea ; but being surprized by the Watch , he came back , and said he could not do it there . While we were coming back , a Watchman came by ; Bob , says I , give him a Shilling ; the Watchman asked who 's there ? Friends , says I , and we gave him a Shilling to drink . Coming back , ( in the middle of Feather-stone-street ) we met Tom the Shoemaker , and Bess the Carrier , who were to take Watson 's Tea : D - ye ( says Robert Heming , what makes you so late ? I ordered you at two o'Clock , and you make it three . Watson waited for them in the Stone-Yard ; and we were consulting where to go . While we were considering , Tom the Shoemaker came to us ; for God 's Sake , says he ; come back , the Watch has taken our Tea from us : Watson 's Tea was gone , and Jack Heming had unstrapp 'd his Horse , and threw his Load off : Watson rode a Grey Horse , with a long Tail ; Robert Heming a Chesnut Sorrel ; Jack Heming a Milk-white , and I rode a Coal black one . When Jack Heming went away he bid us come immediately after him ; but I did not think sit to leave my Load there , so I cross 'd the Road and laid it on a Dunghill ( or Laystall ) in Old-street , and then I rid after them , and came to a Porch , where I saw Jack Heming and his white Horse ; his Horse 's Head was within the Porch , and he had his Whip in one Hand , and a Pistol in the other , and he cry 'd , D - you you old Rogue , I will shoot you . This was in Mr. Everet 's Porch , in Brown-street by Bun-hill-Row : The Porch is four Feet and a half before the House . I came up and asked , what 's here to do ! says he , here 's the Rogue who took the Tea : No Pistol-work , for God 's sake , says I , do n't beat him any more ; and a Man look 'd out of the Window , and asked what was the Matter ; and immediately Bob Heming and the Prisoner came out of an Alley , and came up to us ; we turned from the Porch and met them ; we went to the Stone-Yard , and Watson and I rode side by side . I said , George , 't is strange you could not re-take the Tea ! No , D - 'em , says he , they are gone through the dark Alleys , but D - 'em , I have noynted one of 'em handsomely , and shewed me his Whip , which was broke at the But-end . Council Prisoner . You say it was John Heming who was beating the Man in the Porch ? Walker . Yes , Watson and Robert Heming rode before me to the Porch two or three Minutes . Robert Heming and Watson came to us up Coleman Alley about fifty Yards from the Porch , and Watson shew 'd us his Whip : it was a very heavy one , and the But-end broke ; Watson and Robert Heming rode after the Watch-men about a Minute and a half before John Heming and all of them about three Minutes before me . I had my Tea to unstrap and throw off before I could follow them . Prisoner . You have kept Company with me ever since ; why did you not take me up before ? Walker . I have rid with him many a Time since ; but I had no Inclination to do it before . I made my Information before Mr. Baron Commyns in November last ; and there was no Opportunity to take you before ; besides , I went a Smuggling with him , and was in the same way . A Smuggler is not to be taken at any Time , we are here and there and every where ; I may be shot for what I have done now , and I did not care to expose myself to the Danger then . Prisoner . Why do you discover now ? Walker . Truly , George , because you know we are always in Jeopardy , and I am weary of the Trade ; and as to the Reward , I declare as I am a living Man , I did not know there was any Reward till a Fortnight after I had made the Discovery . I do n't say I saw you strike the Man ; not one Word of mine ( George ) shall hurt you , more than is Truth . Edward Lawrence . I live over-against the Porch . May 17. about three in the Morning , I heard a great Noise , and got up and went to the Window , and I saw a Woman have hold of the Deceased , crying out , Thieves ! Murder ! then I saw some Horsemen galloping down ; and when they came up , the Woman quitted her hold , and he crept as far into the Porch , as he could : One of the Men was upon a Gray , and the other upon a Brown or a Sorrel Horse . I am positive to the Gray Horse ; the Man rode his Fore-feet into the Porch , and with the Handle of the Whip , gave the Deceased a great many Blows ; he cry 'd out , Oh ! Oh ! and at last , Oh Lord ! you have kill 'd me ! Then he drew his Horse out of the Porch , and the Man on the Brown Horse would have got his Horse in , but he had a long Stick in his Hand , and he struck him with it four or five Times . I threw up the Sash , and cry 'd out , You Villains , have you a Mind to murder the Man ; they went off , and I dress 'd myself , and went to the Window again , but the Deceased was gone , and in the Afternoon I heard he was dead . It was just Twilight , and in a narrow Street : I am not mistaken , if it was not a perfect white Horse ; I wrote down the Colour the same Day , while it was fresh in my Memory : here it is set down , a light Gray Horse . Walker . Watson 's Horse was a dark Gray , 15 Hands high , with a long Tail . Jonathan Everet . I live in the House where the Porch is . I heard a great Noise of Horses , and got up to see what was the Matter ; I heard grievous Blows given , and saw two Men on Horseback : One was on a light Gray Horse , and he got into the Porch as far as he could ; the other was on a Sorrel Horse and he was Startlish , and the Man could not get him in . I heard them say , you Old Rogue , go to rob a Woman ! I 'll knock you o th ' Head . When I came down Stairs , the Porch was sprinkled with Blood , and the Deceased was gone . He dyed the same Day . Mary Taylor . I live at the Corner of Featherstonm-Street . On the 17th of May about 3 Years ago , I heard a Noise of Thieves and Murder , and presently I heard Horses come Galloping down the Street , I look 'd out and saw one Horse with his Fore-feet in the Porch ; I was so frighted I did not observe the Colour of the Horses . John Willson . I was Brother Watchman with Alexander that Time . We were going our Rounds , and we met a Man and a Woman with Baskets ; the Constable asked what they had got , they said they were going to Market : The Constable said , it looks like Linnen , take it down : When we had taken down the Baskets , the Man ran away , and the Woman ran after him , and cry 'd they have robb 'd us Dicky . We lay 'd hold of her , and she threw herself down and clung to some Pallisades , crying Dicky , Dicky , Dicky , why do n't you come away . While we were struggling with her , two Horsemen came Galloping from the Dog House Bar , so we left the Woman and made off ; he got into the Porch , and I made down Coleman's-Alley : The Man on the Gray Horse push 'd by me ; he was going towards the Porch , and I got over a Wall and escap 'd . He dy 'd about 12 the same Day . Richard Hachlin . I watch in Lombard-Street , and was coming home to Coleman Alley about 3 o'Clock in the Morning , and saw one Man following a Horse . and another Horseman in the middle of Bunhill-Row ; they asked me , if I was the Man that was to call up their Folks ; I was afraid of them and said Yes , and they gave me something to drink . Thomas Godman . My Servant attended the Deceas 'd that Night , and he told me , he was dying . About 10 o'Clock the same Morning I found him convuls 'd . He had a large contused Wound on the left side of his Head , which was the Occasion of his Death . I open 'd him two Days afterwards , and took out two pieces of his Scull that were beat in . I believe the Wound was given with a heavy blunt Weapon . Defence . On the 17th of May , 3 Years ago , I was upon a Gray Horse , but not there . I came from Highgate to Aldersgate Street ; at the Coach and Horses I met with John Heming and George Walker , and I asked them what they had done with their Hundred of Tea , and they told me the Watch had taken it away in Bunhill-Fields ; but that they had met with one of them , and had beat him sufficiently , and they were afraid he would not recover . Robert Dimmock . I heard this Tray ( we call him so , his right Name is Walker ) talking with Towzer in the next Yard to mine on Mussel hill , and telling him they had beat a Watchman , and were afraid he wou 'd die . I ca n't say I heard him tell who did it . Walker . This is the Man that takes our Goods in . Henry Press . I was Hostler at the Cock-Inn in Aldersgate-Street , and I believe , it was the Morning the Man was kill 'd , that I took in Tray and Towzer 's Horses ; and they told me a Watchman was kill 'd in Bunhill-Fields . One rode a Gray Horse , and the other a Sorrel , and they came in about 4 in the Morning : I saw nothing of Watson . Walker . After the Murder was committed , we went to Spittle-Fields to deliver some Goods there , and I believe Watson might be half an Hour before us , for I had Goods to deliver in the back Shed of the George , near Shoreditch-Church ; I did indeed come to the Cock with another Horse , but Towzer was not with me . Q . You know them all by their Nick-names , how many Smugglers us 'd your House ? Press . I had eleven or twelve Horses at that time . Mary Pultney . I heard the Evidence Lawrence tell Watson in Newgate , that Tray came to him half an Hour after the Accident happen 'd , and asked him where he was when the Mischief was done : and Lawrence told him he was at the Burying-Ground . Lawrence deny 'd this . Walker . This Woman is one of our Dealers . Samuel Jones . I am a Weaver , and was in Company with Walker , somewhere about the Custom-House , and he told me he should do George no harm , but he must act for the Safety of his Family . Walker . This Samuel Jones is a Smuggler and an Informer . Q . How come the honest Weaver to talk so freely with a Smuggler about another notorious Smuggler . Samuel Jones . I own I was a Smuggler . Q . Then why do you come here as an honest Weaver ? - Pullen . I am a Waiter and a Searcher . I informed the Commissioners of the Customs , I had found out George Watson . I got a Capiat for 450 l. and a Writ of Assistance ; I got a Soldier , and told him he must fight for the King and at Coppet 's Farm we got another Man . Then we went to the House . I went in first , and he did not behave like a Murderer ; for he had three Pistols and a Blunderbus , which he might have made use of . Then my Assistants came up , and I said , here take this Pistol , and this , and this , and this Blunderbus ; then I told him he must go with us , and George , says I , your 's are foolish Arms to mine , and out I pull 'd my Brace of Horse Pistols . I asked him about the Murder , and he said he would not tell me the Truth . James Capstick and Sarah Capstick . We never knew but that the Prisoner was an honest Man ; he has used our House three Years . Q . Did you never hear he was a Smuggler ? Capstick . Yes . Q .

One other Book intitled , The Fable of the Bees ; Part the 2d by the Author of the first , the Goods of Francis Clay , Samuel Birt and Daniel Brown , in the Warehouse of Daniel Brown , April 23 . Mr. Brown . About the middle of April last , I saw a Catalogue of Books which were to be sold by Mr. Osborne , at Gray's-Inn , and among them , I saw The Laws of the Stannaries ; I question whether there was one single Book under this Title to be sold but what was the Property of John Trinley , James Newton and my self . I apply 'd to Mr. Osborne to know if he had a Num-ber of them to sell ; he said he had several , and that he bought them of one Whitaker . I went to Whitaker , and he told me he had them of one Savage a Book-binder in Lothbury ; and Savage told me he had them of Mr. Bannister , the Prisoner at the Bar : Mr. Whitaker inform 'd me he had sold 18 of these Books to Mr. Wer-ral in Bell-Yard . When Mr. Savage informed me about these Books , I asked him if ever he had had any more , or any other , from the Prisoner : and he gave me an account of 49 different Books , every one of which I am satisfy 'd had been in the Warehouse ; among them , there are four or five which are mention 'd in the Indictment , and to which my Servant will speak more particularly . The Laws of the Stannaries were printed for Mr. Newton , and my Father a dozen Years ago ; and they have lain in Stock ( as we call it ) ever since . The Books are the Property of Mr. Trinley , my self , and Mr. Newton ; the Warehouse belongs to Mr. Trinley and I . The Prisoner made use of a large long Room , as a Warehouse , and at the End of it there is a Room , which we make use of as our Warehouse : There is another Warehouse up three or four Steps , at some Distance from this ; and when I sent the Laws of the Stannaries , by my Servant , they were put in either of the Warehouses , as there was room ; and the Doors were secur 'd by Padlocks . I let to the Prisoner the Room which he occupy 'd , and his Room is situate between the two Rooms we make use of . I had miss 'd several Books out of the Warehouse , but the Laws of the Stannaries I did not miss , 'till I happened to see them in a Catalogue , and I knew there were none of these Books in Trade , but what were in my Custody . I traced the Matter , and found Mr. Osborne had bought 14 of Mr. Whitaker and 18 more that Mr. Whitaker had . I miss 'd Hole on the Catechism , 2 Vols . Lex Constitutionis , t ' e Gentleman 's Law . Marcus Antoninus . The Fable of the Bees , Part the Second ; and Discourses on the Doctrine of the Mahometans . In order to prove the Property of the Books , ( the Laws of the Stannaries ) the Original Agreement between Mr. Newton and Mr. Brown was produced , and being prov 'd , was read . Council . This shews the Property to be in two , and they have laid it to be in three in the Indictment . Did not you know that the Prisoner made use of waste Paper in his Business ? Mr. Newton . I do n't know whether he does or not . Council . Did you never hear that your Porter had sold him waste Paper ? Mr. Brown . No . Mr. Riley . I printed part of these Books ; they were printed for Mr. Brown and Mr. Newton , the Father of this Gentleman ; he died before they were finished ; and he as Executor to his Father , is entitled to the Pro-perty . Mr. Newton . I do n't say I was Executor to my Father ; I paid for them myself . I was Partner with my Father ; when he died , my Mother was left Executrix ; I had , as a Partner , a Share in the Stock , and the other Part I purchased of my Mother . Mr. Osborne . I bought fourteen of the Laws of the Stanneries of Mr. Whitaker , who fre-quently came to my Shop to buy Books : He asked me several times if I cared to buy any of these ; and one Day I told him if they did not come to much Money , I would take them ; he brought 14 ; I paid him and took his Receipt . I bought them this Month was Twelve Months ago , and about three Months ago there was a Catalogue of Books published , which brought Mr. Brown to enquire of me , concerning these Laws of the Stannaries , which were in the Catalogue . I told him where I bought them , and shew 'd him Mr. Whitaker 's Receipt . I ordered my Man to put my Seal upon them , and I am positive these are the very books I bought of him ; they have been in my Custody ever since , and are entered in my Quire Book . These Books were objected to , the whole Tities not being set forth . Mr. Brown . Here is the Practical Exposition of the Church Catechism , & c. This was objected to , on the same Account The next is the Emperor Marcus Antoninus , his Conversation with himself . & c supported by the Authorities of Dr. Stanhope , & c. 10 which is added , The Mythological Picture of Cabes . This was objected to likewise . Council . The next is Lex Constitutionis , & c. Council . There is no Name in the Indictment , who it was printed for ; nor to the next Book , The Fable of the Bees . The Indictment being defective , the whole Titles of the Books not being set forth , the Court directed the Jury to acquit the Prisoner ; and inform 'd the Prosecutors they might prefer a new Indictment . The TRYALS being over , the Court pro ceeded to give Judgment as follows : Received Sentence of Death 1. George Watson , otherwise Yorkshire George . Burnt in the Hand 1. David Lacock . Whipt 1. Charles Jarvis . To be Transported 36. Stephen Cramp , Sarah Greenwood , Mary Swan , Mary Buckley , John Mallabar , Fran .
