See summary . ] George Pitts of the Parish of St. Dunstans in the West , Gentleman , was Arraingned upon two Indictments for Killing John Hoyle , Gent . of the Temple in London , the first Indictment was laid for the Murther at Common Law , the second upon the Statute of Stabbing , but the Grand-Jury committing an Error , ( which was by Endorsting Billa Vera on that Bill for Stabbing , when it was really agreed by all of them , that it should have been an Ignoramus , and Billa Vera , should have been upon the Bill at Common Law ) this did occasion a great Controversie in Court ; the Jury acknowledged that it was a great Mistake , committed by one of their Brethren , who did plead perticularly for himself , telling the Court that he was the only Person , that had the Misfortune to make that Error , which he was heartily sorry for , and hoped therefore that the Gentleman who was to be Tryed , would suffer no particular Damage , withal excusing the rest of his Brethren , upon this the Judges did differ somewhat in their Opinions , fearing that if it should be altred it might make a President for the future : So at last did agree to try the Prisoner upon both the Indictments , which set forth that on the 27th day of May last , about two of the Clock in the Night of the same day in the Parish aforesaid , the Prisoner in his Rage and Malice before-thought , In and upon the said John Hoyle , did make an Assault , and with a Sword value 5 s. upon the Left side of the Body of the said John Hoyle , did Strike , Stab and Thrust in the said John Hoyle , having no Weapon drawn , giving him one Mortal Wound of the breadth of one Inch , and of the depth of five Inches , of which the said John Hoyle then and there instantly died : The matter of Fact was thus . That the said Mr. Pitts and two or three more Gentlemen , being drinking at the Young Devil-Tavern in Fleet-street , Mr. Hoyle was sent for , who came , and after some time , Mr. Hoyle , without any Provocation , began to talk very scurrilously against the present Government , and spake very unbecoming words against the Person of King William , whereupon Mr. Pitts replied , That he was very hard to be pleased if this King would not please him who was now hazarding his Life for Us , and Mr. Hoyle continuing to rail against all Government , Mr. Pitts endeavoured to perswade Mr. Hoyle to lay by such discourse , but he would not , but gave the Prisoner , Mr. Pitts , very unworthy Language and provoking Words , calling him Coward , or to that effect , thereupon Mr. Hoyle and Mr. Pitts rising up , Mr. Clarke ( one of the Gentlemen in the company ) put himself between them , and desired Mr. Pitts to be pacified , then said Mr. Pitts ( Mr. Clarke ) pray take my Sword , for you know it is not fit for a Gentleman to hear this Language with a Sword by his side , then Mr. Hoyle went away , but after a little time he came back again , and forced himself into the company , and then gave the Lye to Mr. Pitts three times , when he said nothing to him , whereupon Mr. Pitts told him this is meer Madness , and took the Glass and said here 's to you Mr. Hoyle , and drank to him ; then Mr. Pitts paid for the Wine and went away , and Mr. Hoyle and the rest followed him , after this there were some Proposals made of a Place to Fight on the Morrow , and then they two going along the street together , ( the other two Gentlemen going towards Temple-Barr ) when they came over against the Temple-Gate , they fell foul upon each other , Mr. Hoyle first taking Mr. Pitts by the Crevate , tore it , and almost strangled him , then struck him over the Head with a Stick , upon which Mr. Pitts was forced to stand upon his Guard and drew his Sword , not knowing but the Deceased had drawn his ; so at length Mr. Hoyle received the Wound aforesaid , which the Chirurgeon gave account was Mortal , then Mr. Pitts went off : It was fully proved that Mr. Hoyle first began , and was the occasion of all the Quarrel , and several Witnesses were called , who gave account that Mr. Hoyle , in his life-time , was a Person much addicted to quarrelling , & c. Whereas , on the contrary , Mr. Pitts called seven Peers , and several Persons of Quality , who satisfied the Court that Mr. Pitts had always been a Gentleman of a very obliging , peaceable , quiet and moderate Behaviour in all Company , no ways given to Passion or Revenge , and the Prisoner himself did very affectionately declare that he had no manner of Antipathy , against Mr. Hoyle , nor never but once before was in his company , and that what he did was in his own defence , for which great Misfortune he was heartily sorry , for he did not intend any such thing that happened : He produced the Gentlemen who were at the Tavern with him , and saw all that passed , who gave a fair account of the matter of Fact , as aforesaid , which was of great Satisfaction to the Court , how that Mr. Pitts was much abused , Mr. Hoyle calling Mr. Pitts , Poultroon , Rascally Coward , & c. telling him his Sword was Rusty , with such like aggravating Language , & c. The Tryal was very long , and great Care was taken on both sides ; So the Gentlemen of the Jury having withdrew for a small time , and being returned , gave in their Verdict that Mr. Pitts was only Guilty of Manslaughter . After which he petitioned the benefit of his Clergy , and desired his Prayer might be Recorded , which was done accordingly , and an Appeal for Murther was brought against him : He gave sufficient Bail to answer the same at the next Sessions , & c.
