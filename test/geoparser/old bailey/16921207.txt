[ Green : Death . See summary . ] [ Williams , Oliver : Death -respited for pregnancy . See summary . ] Thomas Austin of Christ Church in London , Taylor , was indicted and tried for poysoning his Wife Katherine Austin , on the 13th day of November last , by putting white Mercury into a pint of Ale , of which she immediately died .

The Chyrurgion , who dissectect her , gave his Opinion , and said , That the Liver was discoloured , and the Stomach expoliated , and very black in four or five places ; which discolouration must be effected by some Corrosive Matter thrown into the Stomach , and must proceed from Poyson . Other Witnesses declared , That the Prisoner was reported to have had more affection for another Woman , than he had for the Deceased Katharine , but that was not made appear . The Prisoner said his Wife was a very ill woman , and had an Evil Tongue , and sought his Ruine , and would not live with him , therefore she had out of spight brought this upon him ; to prove which , he called some Witnesses , who confirmed what he said , and that she was a very debauched woman , given much to drinking , and had been troubled with the Foul Disease , and was oftentimes sickly ; there was no one that see the Poyson put into the Ale ; so upon the whole the Gentlemen of the Jury acquitted the Prisoner .

On the same day the Prisoner was taken in Goodmans fields , being dogg 'd from place to place ; and when they came to lay hands on him , he fell a quaking and trembling , and was much surprized ; but after that he was carried before the Lord Mayor , and whilest he was waiting , and the Constable talking to another man he got away , and run for it , but since that did surrender himself .

The Trial was very long , and distinctly carried on both sides : And the Gentlemen of the Jury were so well satisfied , that they found him guilty , without going from their Seats . [ Death . See summary . ] John Stafford , Ambrose Holland , and Elkana Smewin , were all three indicted for a Robbery upon the High-way , committed upon the Body of John Smith and others , in the Parish , of South-Mims , in the County of Middlesex , on the 10th of November last . They met him upon the Road in Mims Wash , and took from him 19 l. in Money , and 100 Yards of Bone-Lace value 31 l. which Smith swore he was robbed of , but could not swear to the Prisoners ; only he said four Men robbed him ; but another Evidence swore that he found the Lace in a Box in Stafford 's Lodgings at the Black Horse in Queen-street , which Smith owned to be his , swearing positively to the Marks which was set on with his own hand : It was farther deposed that Stafford fled when he was first searcht after , and endeavoured to escape ; but was at last taken in a Garret in Queen-street , and that one George Kemble , and one Wilder were concerned with him , who are not yet taken ; and when Stafford and Wilder went out of Town , they were poor , but when they returned again they got all new Cloaths presently , and were full of Money . Another Evidence swore , that Holland was in the Robbery , and he knew him , for that his Teeth were out before , and had Pock holes in his Face ; and when he came to see him in Newgate , he knew him very well again . Another Witness swore , that seven Men came to the Sign of the White Hart in South Mims , and called for a Flagon of Beer , and the Carriers and Mr. Smith coming by , they went no further from London , but returned back with the Carriers ; and about half a Mile out of the Town they commited the Robbery , and kill 'd some of the Horses , and took 700 s. from a Carrier out of 1500 l. and Smewin was one , and Witney the Captain of them all was in the company , who kill 'd all the Horses to the number of 20 but is not as yet taken ; and that they had two Led Horses : The Evidence was very clear against Holland and Smewin ; they all called some Witnesses , Holland called a Chyrurgeon , who said , that he was wont to go to Administer Physick to him , and to dress a Swelling he had in his Breast , which he did from the second of November to the 17th ; but he might be mistaken as to the time . Stafford 's Witnesses spoke very favourably of him , saying , that he had a Horse kept in Queen-street , and that he had a Brother in Worstershire where he was wont to reside more than in London , and behaved himself in a very civil manner there , and that another man Lodged in the same Room with him , that had a Box as well as he , so the Lace might be there , Smewin had little to say , the Evidence being so positive against him , that he was one of the Seven , and rid upon a bright Bay Horse , less than the rest . Then the Court Summ 'd up the Evidence exactly to the Jury , directing them to enquire fetiously into the Matter , and to bring in a Verdict according as in their consciences they found them deserving and not to forget how pernicious such Offenders were not only to the Right and Property of any particular Person , so robb 'd by them , but to the Kingdom in general . The Trial was very long , and the Jury took , considerable time before they agreed , and at last , not being fully satisfied that it was found in Mr. Stafford 's Box they acquitted him ; but Holland and Smewin were found guilty of the Robbery ; upon which Holland replied , before he went from the Bar , that when he was dead the Robbery would be discover 'd more fully , and who were concern 'd in it ; endeavouring to insinuate into the Credit of the Court , so far as to make them have a good Opinion of him ; that although he had been an ill Man formerly yet he was innocent of this robbery .
