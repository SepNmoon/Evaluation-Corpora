He was positive the Prisoner must take his Pouch and Money , he being at that Time very sober , and there being no Person in this Company but the Prisoner , who sat by him in the Box , tho ' he had no Familiarity with her , but in the way of Talk and Drinking together , thinking it to be an Act of Charity to give her a Pot of Drink , and that he did not so much as kiss her Lips , nor feel her any where at all , while they were together , but he did suppose she took the Pouch as they were rising up to go away . The Prisoner 's Defence was , That as she was going along the Back Lane from Rag Fair , with a Basket of Oysters , the Prosecutor took her hold by her Arm , telling her , she was very like a young Woman whom he Courted seven Years ago , and would have had her gone in with him no drink at the Sign of the Ship , but she refus 'd ; that he still went along with her , and offer 'd her two Shillings to let him lie with her , but she would not consent to any such Thing , upon which the Prosecutor abus 'd her , and threw down her Basket of Oysters , calling her Names , telling her he had been with a Bitch that had robb 'd him of his Money ; and if she would not let him he with her , he would swear the Robbery to her .

That he replied , What need of that ? there were more Masters than Parish Churches . That the next Time he saw him he asked him , How he came off ? To which he answer 'd him , very well . And he reply 'd again , He was glad of it . That afterwards standing at a Cobler 's Door , the Prisoner Whiteing ask 'd him to go with him to buy some Leather to mend his Shoes ; that he went with him , and they went in to Drink , and that he told him , he could get 500 l. if he and another , meaning Mackey , would assist him in the Affair . That he then ask 'd him , how he could get to much Money ? That he told him it might be done very easily ; and that afterwards they all being drinking together in a private Room in an Alehouse , they consulted about the Matter . That Whiting told them , young Mr. Saunderson was coming out of the Country with 200 l. and there was two or 300 Pounds in Place , and the Method proposed by Whiteing for doing it , was this . Mackey being a Butcher , was to bring a Bottle of Blood on the Night appointed , and he and this Evidence being let in , they went to blind and gag Mr. Saunderson , his Lady , and the vest of the Family , except Whiteing , in whose room this Blood was to be thrown and trampled about , to make a Show as if he had been murthered and carried off , then some of the Windows were to have been broken , as if they had come in that way ; but Mackey would not be concerned in binding and gagging them . That they asked Whiteing , if they got this Booty . How they must dispose of themselves and it ; and Whiteing said , they would go to New England , he knew the way thither ; that they would go down to Portsmouth , and thence into the Isle of Wight , and would melt down the Plate , which he knew how to do .

That Whiteing the Footman opened the Door , and brought out to him the Plate bundled up in a Coat , that appear 'd in Court to be Mr. Saunderson 's . That then he gave him also a pair of pistols , bidding him take care of them , for he should have Occasion for them . That then he went away into Lincoln 's Inn Fields , and not seeing Mackey at the place , thought he had been gone , but after calling him two or three Times he came , and he told him he had got something , asking him to go along with him ; and they did go out into the Fields , and stay 'd there till Break of Day , where they opened them , and having seen whit there was , made the best of their Way to Portsmouth , where they were apprehended . Mr. Lake , a Goldsmith at Portsmouth , depos 'd That Mackey brought to him part of the Gripe of a Silver Hilted Sword , which he bought of him ; and the-next Day came again ; and talked , to him about buying Silver , asking him , What he would give an Ounce ? And , whether he would give most for it in Form , or melted down ? That he asking several impertinent Questions ; and he , this Evidence , having been that Morning at the Coffee-House , and seen the Advertisement of Mr. Saunderson 's Robbery , had some Suspicion of the Prisoner ; and endeavouring to get what he could out of him , enquired how he came by it . To which he answered , he came home in that Ship which had brought home the resolutions , and that was part of his Plunder . He told the Prisoner Mackey , That there was a Neighbour over the Way who had lost some Plate , and he must him to stay till he had sent for his Neighbour , and sent for Mr. Harman , who was a Justice of the Peace , who examining him , finding his Account was inconsistant , and that he could not tell the Name of the Captain , Lieutenant , or any of the Officers of the Ship he said , he belong 'd to , committed him to Prison .

That they always kept their Chamber Door lock 'd , and would not permit any Body to go into it , it strengthened their Suspicion ; and having apprehended him , demanded Entrance into his Room to search , whereupon he was showing them into another Room . of the same Floor ; the Landlady told them , that was not his Room , but the next they searched all about but could find nothing , till examining an old Chest of Drawers , in the bottom Drawer , which being so heavy with the Plate , that without Difficulty they could not get it out ; but having at last done it , they found the Plates . That thereupon they were committed to Winchester Goal , and Notice was sent to the Prosecutor , The Plate was produc 'd in Court , and the Pistols , and other Goods , and sworn to by the Prosecutor . Whiting the Footman had little to say in his own Defence , but that he was put upon doing the Fact , by the Solicitations of Wilkinson the Evidence ; and that he and Mackey came into the House , broke the Bar of the Window , and took the Plate . Mackey pleaded , That he was not consenting nor assisting in the Robbery , only having been drinking and walking with Wilkinson , he desir 'd him to stay in Lincoln 's Inn fields , while he stepp 'd a little Way to speak with one , and knew not that he went to commit the Robbery , nor when he came back what he had ; but along him to go along with him , he carried him out into the Fields two or three Miles off .
