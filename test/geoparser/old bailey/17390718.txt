Connor . I came to Eastmead 's House the 1st or 2d of July , about Eleven at Night , with a Gentleman , ( one Mr. Fisher ) and we staid there all Night , and breakfasted and dined there , the next Day . After Dinner we had a Coach , and Mr. Fisher and Mrs. Eastmead and I , went to my Mother 's at Hyde Park , and from thence went round to Brumpton , and Jenny 's Whim . I was then dressed in White ; and when we came into Piccadilly , I said I would go home , and change my Gown , to keep it clean . So I got out of the Coach , and Mr. Fisher called after me , and bid me come to Eastmond 's Bagnio again ; he lives in Leicester-Fields . I promised him I would , and when I had changed my Cloaths at my Washerwoman 's , I went again to the Bagnio , and asked for Mr. Fisher . Mr. Eastmead told me , he was not there - and if he was , I should not see him : I said , I was sure he was there , and called out , - Mr. Fisher ! Upon this Mr. Eastmead knocked me down in the Entry , and both he , and his Wife , dragged me into their Back-Parlour , or Bed-chamber , and they beat me in a miserable Manner : When I cry 'd out , Mrs Eastmead stopped my Mouth with her Hand , and then they stripp 'd my Cloaths off , and would have taken off my Shift , if People had not come into the House , - I had much ado to keep it on . They swore at me , and told me 't was no Sin to kill me , if they had a Knife . They took from me a Pair of Stays , a Green Silk Quilted Coat , and a Hoop-Petticoat , and I have never heard of my Cloaths since . After he had used me ill , I cry 'd out , Murder ! Upon which he took me up in his Arms , and flung me out of the House , in such a Manner , that my Face fell upon the Flag-Stones , and I bled a great deal . When I got out of the Coach in Piccadilly , in order to change my Gown , I left Mr. Fisher and Mrs. Eastmead in the Coach , and he ( Fisher ) bid me come to him again , and not stay long . - 'T is not the first unhappy Girl they have used so . Mrs. Eastmead owned before Mr. Deveil , That she had my Cloaths ; and People came to me to offer me Money not to appear against them . Prisoner 's Q . Did not you say you would go up Stairs and see for Mr. Fisher ? Connor . On my Oath I did not : I only called - Mr. Fisher ! - at the Bottom of the Stairs , because if he had been in the Parlour , I wanted to have spoken with him : He had told me he wanted to speak with me . I have known Eastmead a great while , but I have not frequented the House much . Prisoner 's Q . Whose Stays were they ? Connor . I bought them of Mrs. Eastmead , and paid her for them . I paid her a Guinea and four Shillings for them : One Mrs. Richards saw me pay her for them , about eight Months ago . I paid her a Guinea all at once , and the four Shillings afterwards . Mary Hopson . I saw her come home that Evening , in a White Gown ; she called for her Brown Gown , and put it on . 'T was about a Fortnight ago Yesterday . She came Home again in about half an Hour , very bloody ; her Gown was torn down ; her Stays , and her Hoop and Quilted Coat were gone . Her Apron , Handkerchief , and Cap , were very bloody ; and she told me , Mr. Eastmead and his Wife had almost murdered her . Margaret Morgan . She came home in the Condition Mrs. Hopson has mentioned , and told me she had been almost murdered by Eastmead ; That she asked for Mr. Fisher , and Mr. Eastmead told her , he was not there , and he was glad he had got her alone . She returned ( in half an Hour after she had changed her Gown without her Stays ; her Gown was rent or cut down with a Knife , her Quilted Coat , and her Hoop was gone ; her Dressed-Cap was all over Gore-blood , and her Apron , - you might have rung the Blood out of it . She told us Mrs Eastmead got her into the Parlour , and stopped her Mouth with her Hand , while her Husband robbed her . Mrs. Eastmead . I desire she may be asked , in what Manner she was robbed . Connor . I have told you already , - and have not told one Word of a Lie . They beat me in a violent Manner : I bled at the Nose and Mouth ; my Face and Hands were as if they had been dipped in Blood . Mr. Eastmead . She came to my House with Mr. Fisher the 2d of July ; they lay there all Night , and next Day , they breakfasted and dined together : They had a Leg of Lamb and Green Peas for Dinner , and drank plentifully of Wine and Shrub . In the Afternoon my Wife and they went out in a Coach to Brumpton . He returned to my House , without the Girl , and told me , if Moll Connor should come to enquire for him , I must not own he was there , for she had done him a great Injury . In a little Time she came , and called - Jack Fisher , - you Scrub ! and she pulled off her Cloaths herself , and would go up Stairs , whether we wou 'd or no . Frances Prince . I remember Mary Connor 's coming to Eastmead 's about a Week , - about three Weeks ago . She went out with Mr. Fisher , about a Five o'Clock in the Afternoon . Fisher came back about Eleven o'Clock , and ordered that the Gentlewoman that had been with him the Night before , should not be admitted to him , In a Quarter of an Hour after this , Connor came in , and insisted on seeing the Gentleman , whereof , she was deny 'd ; upon which she went into the Parlour and pulled off her Cloaths , - her Stays , her Quilted Coat , and her Hoop , and said she would go up Stairs to him . I was at this Time in the Entry , and stood at the Parlour Door and saw her undress herself . Fisher lay up one Pair of Stairs , and she was going up to him , but my Mistress , ( Eastmead ) pulled her down again , and she struck my Mistress in the Face , and made a great Disturbance at the Door , and said she would be revenged of them , and would send them to Newgate . I saw her pull off her Cloaths in the Parlour , to go to Bed to the Gentleman up Stairs : My Master and Mistress were in the Room at the same Time . I stood at the Parlour Door . There was another young Woman ( Elizabeth Davis ) who waited upon Mr. Fisher ; she was above Stairs with him , and gave Orders that Connor should not be admitted to him . Prisoners . Was there any Blows given to Connor ? Prince . I saw none , nor any Blood , nor any thing of her Gown being torn , but I saw her strike my Mistress in the Face . Jury . Is there a Bed in this Parlour ? Prince . Yes ; a standing Bed : A high Bed , with a Tester . Elizabeth Davis . I know Mary Connor , and remember her coming to Eastmead 's : She lay one Night there with Mr. Fisher , and went out with him next Morning in a Coach ; as near as I can remember they went out about Seven o'Clock in the Morning . I put them into the Coach together at Seven o'Clock in the Morning . + + At the Desire of the Jury the Witnesses for the Prisoners were examined apart . Q . Did any body else go with them in the Coach ? Davis . I ca n't remember whether any Body went with them , or not . Mr. Fisher returned by himself in a Chair , about Eleven at Night ; I saw no more of them , from Seven in the Morning , 'till Eleven at Night . They neither break-fasted , nor dined at our House , - neither Mr. Fisher nor Connor . When he came in at Eleven , he ordered that she ( Connor ) should not go up Stairs to him , but when she returned , she said , she would go up ; so I informed her , the Gentleman desired not to see her , and called my Mistress ( Eastmead ) to her , who told her she must not go up to Mr. Fisher . She went into the Back-Parlour , and undressed herself ; my Master was at the same time below in the Kitchen ; my Mistress was in the Parlour with Connor , and I was above Stairs - but I saw her fling her Cloaths off , - for I was coming down Stairs , and telling her , she must not go up . - There was no one but my Mistress in the Room , for my Master was below Stairs , and Frances Prince was gone to Bed when this happened . My Mistress desired her to take her Cloaths , but she said she would not , - for she would send her and my Master to Newgate , and would swear a * Robbery against them ; so she went away and left her Cloaths in the Parlour . * Though her Evidence amounted to a Robbery , the Indictment was laid only for Stealing , which being a single Felony , a Married Woman could not be found Guilty of such a Fact committed in Company of her Husband ; the Law of England presuming she is so much in his Power as to act by his Compulsion . Humphry Ingram . I do n't know Connor , but I had some Acquaintance with one of Eastmead 's Maids , and was below in the Kitchen , on the 2d of July , when this Disturbance happened above Stairs , and went half Way up , and heard Mrs. Eastmead say to Connor , you need not undress your self , for here you shall not lie To night . Connor said , she would go up Stairs , and Words arose , and some Blows passed . After this , Connor said , if you wo n't let me lie here , turn me out . Aye , says Eastmead , go out , - but take your Cloaths with you ; No , says Connor , I will not , for I will send you both to Newgate . This was between Eleven and Twelve at Night . Jury . How came you to be there that Night ? Ingram . I went to see their Maid Fanny , She and I were below in the Kitchen , and we were coming up Stairs ; for I was going away , if this Disturbance had not happen 'd . As the Dispute rose higher , I proceeded higher , and stood at the Top of the Stairs , but went no farther . Frances ( Prince ) went into the Parlour ; I saw her go in at the Door : There are two Parlours , - I ca n't tell which of them she went into , I think it was into the back Parlour , to assist her Mistress ; both the Doors were open , but I could not see far enough to have a View of the Place where the Squabble was . I saw no Blood , - not a Drop ; nor did I see Mr. Eastmead all that Night : I heard a Man 's Tongue , but I ca n't take upon me to say it was his . Robert Hinder . I have known the Eastmeads five or six Years , and know nothing but that they are honest People : They keep a handsome House - a Bagnio ; I served them with Goods , and they paid me . I do n't know that they keep a Bawdy-house . Jury . What Goods did you serve them with ? Hinder . Upholsterers Goods . John Debell . I am a Bricklayer , and have trusted them Scores of Pounds ; my Wife keeps a Cheesemonger 's Shop : I have dealt with them in both Branches , and they have paid me honestly . John Edwards . The Prisoners are very honest People , for ought I know . On Monday the 2d of July , I was making some Alterations in their Parlour , and I saw the Prosecutrix there in a Plaid Night-gown , a single Petticoat , and her Smock on ; she was shelling Peas with a Gentleman in the Kitchen : I believe she is a common Woman , for I heard her once tell Eastmead , that she was just come out of the Marshalsea , but she need not be afraid , for she would pay her very handsomely . They keep Fanny to sweat and bathe . Antonio Lucera . I know the Prisoners ; her I have known 10 Years ; she lived with the French and Spanish Ambassadors , and had a good Character : I deal with them in Wine . Isaac Itorno . I have known her seven Years , him five Years ; but I come to speak about Connor . She is a Woman of the Town : She came to me , and told me , - by G-d , she would be revenged on the Prisoners , for not letting her go up to the Gentleman . Jury . Pray what Business do you follow ? Itorno . I am a Marshal 's Court Officer ; and if a Prisoner in my Custody calls for a Pot of Beer , I let him have it . Richard Ford . Connor hath the Character of a vile notorious Woman ; she makes a Property of all the People she gets . The Day after the Quarrel , she call 'd on me , and told me she was going to Mr. Deveil for a Warrant for the Prisoners , on Account of a Robbery . A Robbery ! says I , Lord , Molly ! how can you be so vile , to swear a Robbery against the People that find you Victuals and Drink ! I will do it , says she , if I send my Soul to the Devil . Ann Pollard . Connor is a Woman of the Town : I have known her six Years . On the Day this thing was done I was at Eastmead 's , and saw Connor come into the House , about Twelve at Noon , in Mens Cloaths , and at Four in the Afternoon she went out again in the same Dress . I remember it , it was the 2d of July . Jury . This contradicts all the other Witnesses . Mary Peacock . I know Connor ; but I never knew her to be perjur 'd . All that I know of her it , that about a Twelvemonth ago , she came to my House , and lay all Night there with a Man who is my Lodger . Henry Gotobed . I know Connor , but I have never seen her since the Fact , nor do I know any thing of the Matter . Q . What did you come here for ? Gotobed . I do n't know . I know they keep a Bagnio . Richard Temple . I was at the arresting of Connor , and heard her say she would be reveng 'd of the Eastmeads . I know nothing of her Character . Frances Prince . These are the Things which the Lady ( Connor ) pull 'd off in our House ; there are no Cuts in them , nor any Blood upon them . The Jury Acquitted the Prisoners ; but desired the Court would be pleased to take into their Consideration the Necessity there was of suppressing this House . 392.

June 18 . Mr. Brown . On the 18th of June I was walking in the Field towards Hackney Downs ; Brook-House Clock had just struck Six , when the Prisoner came past me , and looking me full in the Face , he went on his Way . But when I was got into the next Field , I saw him coming after me , in a Path between some Corn ; seeing him coming towards me , I made towards the Hedge-Side ; when he came up to me , he made a full Stop , and asked me the Way to Newington ? I directed him thither , and turned my Back on him ; but I had not gone many Steps , before I heard somebody coming behind me ; I turned about , and saw a Man with a Mask upon his Face , and a Pistol in his Hand ; he called to me , and said , - Sir , I must have your Money . Money , says I ! - I do n't know whether I have any Silver or no . However , he came up to me with his Pistol in his Hand , and I put my Hand in my Pocket for my Money ; I had a pretty many Half-Pence , about 8 or 9 Penn'orth , and while I was feeling for them , he saw my Watch Chain : Sir , says he , I must have your Watch . I desired him not to take my Watch , but he said he must have it immediately , and he took hold of the Chain , and drew it out himself ; then he went away , and did not stay to search me any farther . When he was got some Distance from me , I saw him run ; then I call 'd out - Stop Thief ! Stop Highwayman ! Upon the Alarm he was follow 'd and taken . I saw him when the People started after him , but not when he ran out of the Ditch , for that was near Three quarters of an Hour afterwards . I remember the Prisoner 's Face perfectly well ; and though when he robb 'd me he had a Masque on , yet by his Voice and Cloaths , I have Reason to believe he is the Man ; and no one else could come into the Field in that Space of Time . Edward Dixon . The Prosecutor lodged at my House , and at the Time he was robb 'd I was drinking with a Friend at the Door of a Publick House in the Neighbourhood . While I was there , a Man came up and told me the Gentleman had been robb 'd ; so two or three of us went after the Thief ; - One went one Way , and others another . By the Account I had of the Robbery , I thought the Man could not be far off , and that he could not easily escape . I and two others searched for him in the Field next the Downs , and there we found a Track in the Field , which we follow 'd till we came to a Ditch , and under the Bushes I thought-I saw something , and it proved to be the Prisoner . One of the Lads that was with me said , he was sure it was either a Man , or a Sack of Peas that was hid there ; I said 't was a Man ; upon which the Prisoner raised himself upright in the Ditch , from under the Bushes , and put on his Hat and Wig , which before were off , and he had no sooner done that , but he held up a Pistol through the Bushes at me . I drew back , and cautioned those that were with me to do so too ; at the same Time bidding the Prisoner come out ; he accordingly came out , presenting a Pistol in each Hand . We had two or three Dogs with us , and we set them at him , but they would not seize him ; so he ran away , with a Pistol in each Hand , and we pursue 'd him over the Downs , and towards a Wooden Bridge at the Bottom of the Downs , which goes over a Brook . He ran over the Bridge , and we called to a Man , who was then coming over it , to stop him , but he did not . When he had got a few yards over the Bridge , I saw him shift his Pistols into one Hand , and dropp 'd the Watch with the other . I bid one of the Lads take it up , and carry it to Mr. Brown , while we pursued the Prisoner , who ran up a dirty Lane , where some Men were digging Ballast , and we alarmed them likewise . We pursued him out of this Lane , cross Kingsland Road , and through an Orchard , into a large Field of Beans and Peas ; and here the People coming thick upon him , he got into a Corner of the Field , and stood with a Pistol in each Hand , and every one being afraid to go near him for fear of his Pistols , a Man called out for a Gun ; I said , I would go and get one , upon which the Prisoner called to me , and said he would surrender himself to me ; We did not understand him at first ; and a Man asked him , whether he would surrender to him ? No , says the Prisoner - I will surrender to that Man in his own Hair , ( meaning me . ) Then I went nearer him , and desired him to drop his Pistols ; he told me I might come safely , for he would do me no Hurt ; I insisted on his throwing down his Pistols , and while we were arguing , some People got hold of his Arms , and secur 'd him . When he was taken we carry 'd him to a Publick House , ( where he behaved well ) and from thence we took him before Justice Norris , and there he said but very little ; he told the Justice , - he did not chose to say either one Thing or another . This Pair of Pistols was found upon him , and two or three Balls , and a Pair of Bullet-moulds ; one of the Pistols was loaded , but I think it was not prim 'd ; I do n't know whether the other had any Thing more than a Ball and a Bit of Paper in it . I was never above twenty or thirty Yards from him , from the Time of his being started out of the Ditch , to his being taken . Samuel Bamblin confirm 'd Mr. Dixon 's Evidence in every particular ; adding that he deliver 'd the same Watch which the Prisoner dropp 'd into the Prosecutor 's Hands , and it being produced in Court , he swore it was the Watch which was then taken from him , and which was afterwards deliver 'd to him by Bamblin . Henry Harrill , the Constable , produced the Bullet-moulds , the Pistols and the Watch , which were seal 'd up in a Bundle before Mr. Norris and Mr. Tyssen : His Evidence , with regard to the Condition the Pistols were found in , and the Prisoner 's Behaviour when taken , agreed with the former Witnesses . In Answer to a Question relating to the Temper of Mind the Prisoner was in at the Time of his being apprehended , he said , the Prisoner then appear 'd - very solitary , and a Sort of a Wildness appear 'd in his Eyes ; and when any Question was ask 'd him , he turn 'd about , and look 'd wistfully . This Witness likewise depos 'd , that the Prisoner told the Justices , - he chose to say nothing , nor to answer any Questions . Thomas Harrison was at Work in the Gravel-pits by Shacklewell , and when the Prisoner came by , he join 'd with the Rest of the Pursuers , and confirm 'd the former Accounts of the Prisoner 's being taken . Edward Hawkins depos 'd , That he was the Person who came behind the Prisoner and seiz 'd him , while he was parleying with Dixon , the 2d Witness . Job Griffin , William Evans and John Chelton were likewise present when the Prisoner was taken in the Manner already related . DEFENCE . Thomas Steed . I have known the Prisoner from a Child : I knew his Parents ; they lived next Door to me , in St. Clement 's Parish , in Ipswich . His Mother was many Times beside herself ; she made many Attempts to destroy her Life , and at last she hang 'd herself ; I was upon the Coroner 's Inquest , and she was brought in Lunatick , for she had been reputed as such . The Prisoner lived at Ipswich till he was twelve Years old , and behav 'd well ; then he was put out Apprentice at Colchester , and during his Apprenticeship , I only saw him when he came to visit his Friends . His Father was several Times out of Order : - Once I remember he came to our House , and my Wife perswading him to eat something with us , he said , he could not , for if he did he should be choak 'd , and should die at the next high Water . Eleanor Young had known the Prisoner seven Years . She depos 'd , that the Prisoner ( in her Opinion ) had been disorder 'd in her Senses ever since the Death of his Father , who was Master of a Ship , and was drown 'd : That he appear 'd as a Man disturb 'd , and to have had his Mind full of Trouble , for six or seven Weeks before he committed this Fact : That he often appear 'd melancholy , and would immediately be in a Flurry , and look wild : That seven or eight Weeks after he had heard of his Father 's being drowned , he took a House by Hicks's-Hall , and before he came to live in it , he shut himself up in it , and she going there to see him , was obliged to knock half an Hour at the Door , before he open 'd it to her ; that at that Time there were only his Shop Goods in the House , and this she said , was about three Days before the Fact ; she never heard any thing amiss of him before , and observed that he work 'd industriously at his Business of a Cabinet-maker . Francis Young depos 'd , that the Prisoner had been melancholy for six or seven Weeks before the Commission of this Fact : That when he was spoke to , he never cared to speak again : This Witness took him to be a Man disturbed in his Senses , but could not say he ever saw him so much disorder 'd , as not to be capable of distinguishing Good and Evil . He never heard any Ill of him , and took him to be very sober and very industrious . John Sawyer had known him twelve Years , and saw him two or three Days before this Fact . He said , the Prisoner then appear 'd very melancholy , and to be much disorder 'd , which he imputed to the Uneasiness created in his Mind by the Death of his Father . He added , that the Prisoner , ( before he parted with him ) appear 'd to have strange Notions of having a great deal of Business upon his Hands , - so much - that he could not stay to talk with the Witness ; that he started from one Thing to another , and appear 'd disorder 'd in his Understanding , but he could not say he knew no Difference between Good and Evil . Wilford Head had observed him to have been melancholy and dejected , since the Death of his Father , but he took him to be in his Senses , and , as far as he could apprehend , he took him to be capable of discerning Good and Evil . The three following Prisoners were brought from Newgate , to give an account of his Behaviour since his Confinement . Thomas Hunt declar 'd , that he was confin 'd with him on the Common Side , and that once he took a Knife out of his Pocket , and was going to cut his own Throat . That another Night he had put the Bell-rope round his Neck ; and had hang 'd himself , had not the Witness seen him struggling for Life , and hoisted him up till he had disengag 'd him from the Rope , otherwise ( the Witness said ) he had certainly jamm 'd himself . 'T was added farther , that the Prisoner , during his Confinement with them , could never give a regular Answer , that they durst not trust him by himself , and that this had been his Condition very near a Month . John Garment gave the same Account ; and said farther , that they were obliged to keep a Rush Candle burning every Night , for Fear he should make away with himself . William Skingler deposed to the same Effect ; and likewise , that the Prisoner disturb 'd them o'Nights , sometimes by his walking about with melancholy Thoughts , and sometimes by his raveing , and talking of Things without any Sense . Guilty , Death . 398. Archibald Murrey was indicted for stealing five Pieces of Butt-leather , cut out for Shoe-Soles , value 3 s. the Goods of William Bannister , June 16 . Acquitted . 399. Elizabeth Keeve , of St. Butolph , Bishopsgate , was indicted for stealing a Pair of Men 's Shoes , value 3 s. two Pair of Women 's Leather Shoes , value 3 s. six Pair of Damask Shoes , value 12 s. two Pair of Leather Clogs , value 2 s. and several Goods , the Property of John Ridout , Feb. 3 .

George Broderick was indicted ( with Noah Gooby , not taken ) for assaulting William Reynolds , on the King 's Highway , in the Parish of St. Leonard , Shoreditch , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , value 20 s. a Silver Chain , value 4 s. a Silver Seal , value 12 d. a Glass Seal , set in Base-Metal , value 2 d. a Gold Ring , with a Chrystal Stone set therein , value 8 s. and five Shillings and Sixpence in Money , March 20 . Mr. Reynolds . On the 20th of March , I was coming out of the Country , in a Chaise , with a Friend , and on this Side the Turnpike , by Kingsland Road , three Fellows stopped the Chaise , and commanded me out . Then they put a Pistol to my Breast , and two to my Head , swearing they would shoot my Brains out if I made any Resistance . They took from me , a Silver Watch , and after they had got that , they took my Money out of my Pocket , and bid me go about my Business . 'T was then nigh Ten o'Clock at Night . When they had got my Watch and Money , one of them bid the others see if I had no Rings ; I said I had no - Rings , for I had but - one ; and at the same time I endeavoured to shuffle it off , with my Glove , but one of them guessing what I was about , cry 'd - d - mn you , are you going to serve me so , and catching hold of my Glove , he tore it off , and took my Ring , - 't was a Mourning Ring , set with a Chrystal Stone . I advertised the Watch , and Mr. Gardiner brought it to me , but the Ring I never had again . I ca n't swear to the Prisoner , he has been fetched up a great Way out of the Country , but he agrees with the Height of one of the Persons . Samuel Watts . I and Abraham Nash , who was condemned last May * Sessions , with the Prisoner and Noah Gooby went out from Crown Court , in Chick-Lane , on Tuesday Night , in order to rob somebody or other . We went to a Place between Shoreditch and Kingsland , and staid sometime on the Causeway ; and not seeing any body come by , we went past Kingsland Town , it was about half an Hour after Nine , when we had got beyond the Town , about a Quarter of a Mile , we met this Chaise , with a grey Horse : The Horse trotted , and we followed it to Kingsland Town , then it walked , and we ran before the Chaise , till we came to a vacant Place , where we thought proper to stop it . 'T was just at the Stone Watch-house , when two of us went on one Side the Chaise , and two on the other , and stopped it . The Prisoner was on the Off-side of the Horse ; Nash and I were on the other . Nash ordered the Gentleman to come out of the Chaise , and when he had got out , Nash stepped in , and bid me rifle his Pockets : So I took his Watch , and Gooby searched for Money . The Watch was an old-fashion 'd Silver one , without a Minute Hand , but had a new outside Case , and a Silver Chain , and Seal . We took likewise , a Mourning Ring with a little Stone in it , and five Shillings and Sixpence in Money ; these Things we took from Mr. Reynolds . Nash took from the other Gentleman , a large Silver Watch and Silver Chain , and the Name on that Watch was Barrow , and a Gold Ring , with the Name Atwood in the Inside , and between eight and nine Shillings in Money , and his Hat . Then we went directly to Chick-Lane , and stay 'd there all Night . Next Morning we went to a Shop in the Minories , and Gooby went in and sold the Watch : He had at that Time this Coat upon him , which I have on now . 'T was Mr. Reynolds 's Watch we sold there , and got 12 s. for it : The Silver Seal we had taken off before . When we had sold the Watch , we went to the Sign of the Pack Horse , in Goswell-street , where the Prisoner 's Wife lived , and from thence to Chick-Lane . From Chick Lane we went to St. Giles 's , to Nash 's Sweetheart 's Lodging ; from whence we all went together to Bedlam , and spent most of the Money which we had divided between us for the Watch and the Hat ; we gave Money to the Prisoners in Bedlam , and when we came out , we had a Supper in that Neighbourhood , and then we all went together to the Pack-horse . The next Morning we sold the Ring for nine Shillings , and parted the Money equally . The Prisoner was concerned in this , and in several other Robberies : He sent up his Confession from Ipswich to London , not knowing that I had made an Information . * See his Trial , No . 239 . Watts was an Evidence against him . Prisoner . I was committed to Goal , at Ipswich , the 25th of March , and I set out from London for Ipswich , on the 18th , where I made myself an Evidence before Justice Sparrow . Watts . After we had sold these Things , we quarrelled about our Shares of the Money for the rest of them , so we parted , and the Prisoner and one Dick Cadman agreed to go down into the Country together ; and they accordingly set out the next Day but one after this Robbery was committed . The Prisoner and Cadman proposed to go down to Newmarket , and they set out between Eight and Nine in the Morning : They wanted one of our Pistols , but we would not let them have it . Thomas Gardiner . I bought the Watch on the 21st of March , which Mr. Reynolds was robbed of ; and the next Morning I saw an Advertisement at the Coffee-House , in which the Watch was described ; upon which I carry 'd it to him , and he owned it . Neither the Prisoner nor the Evidence , was the Person I bought it of . The Man who brought it to me had the same Coat on , or one very much like that which the Accomplice has on now . 'T is an old String Watch , and goes but twelve Hours : The Movement not being worth a Farthing , I gave 12 s. for it , which was 2 s. more than the Worth of the Silver . The Fellow brought it to me about Ten o'Clock in the Morning , and asked me two Guineas and a half for it : He told me he bought it at Spalding , in Lincolnshire , and had paid so much for it there . After I had paid him the Money , he said , - Sir , if my Brother wont take this Money for it , you 'll let me have it again ? Aye to be sure , says I : So he went away , and came back again to me , and said , his Brother did not chuse to take that Money : Upon this I gave him the Watch , and took my twelve Shillings again . After this , he brought it to me again , and said , - Sir , you are a very honest Man , I have been with it to a Watch-maker in Whitechappel , and he will give but half a Guinea for it : So I brought it you again . There were three other Men at the same time hanging over my Show-Glass ; if I had known them , I could have taken them all together . Nathaniel Harris . I moved the Prisoner by Habeas Corpus from Ipswich Goal : I asked him if he knew Samuel Watts . Yes , very well , says he , and he told me he had committed several Robberies with him , but he was in Hopes of being admitted an Evidence . This was , I think , on the 7th of this Instant . [ July . ] He desired me to go after Cadman and Gooby , and do my Endeavour to apprehend them ; he had made an Information before Mr. Justice Sparrow in Ipswich , in which he had mentioned them both . Prisoner . I was not guilty of this Robbery , but was gone out of Town when it was committed . If I had time I could prove where we lay , every Night , till we had got down to Ipswich . Thomas Cable . I am Keeper of Ipswich Goal ; he was committed there on Lady-Day last , about Twelve o'Clock . This is the Copy of his Commitment . Guilty , Death . 401. Catherine Miller , of St. Andrew , Holborn , was indicted for stealing a Pair of Cotton Stockings , val . 2 s. 6 d. the Goods of Richard Coombes , July 6 . Mr. Coombes . The Prisoner , and another Woman , came into my Shop the 6th of July , ( the Sign of the Lamb at Holborn-Bridge ) and the other Woman ask 'd for Children 's Hose : My Wife shew 'd her several Sorts , but she did not like any of them . The Prisoner wanted embroidered Thread Hose , which I shew 'd her : I had some Suspicion of them , and keeping my Eye on them , I saw the Prisoner take one Pair out of the Parcel which lay before her . She bid me Four Shillings for a Pair I had asked Six Shillings for , and then I told her I believed she did not want a Pair , for she had got a Pair already ; and I immediately whipp 'd over the Counter , and found a Pair upon + her . Then I had her into my Parlour , and there she dropp 'd another Pair , which she had stole from the Black Lamb over-against St. Sepulchre 's Church . She had tuck 'd my Stockings under her Stays through some Holes in her Cloaths , with her right Hand . These are the Stockings , and I swear they are mine . Here 's the Maker 's Name on them . + As there must be a Taking to make a Larceny , so there must also be a carrying away : but it is sufficient if the Thing taken be removed though never so little , from the Place where it was . Any Woman convicted of feloniously taking Money or Goods , above the Value of 12 d. and under 10 s. shall be branded in the Hand upon the Brawn of the Left Thumb with a Hot Iron , having a T upon it ; the Mark to be made by the Gaoler openly in Court . 21 Jac . I. cap . 6. Joseph Monory saw a Pair of Mr. Coombes 's Hose taken from under her Cloaths ; he observ 'd one End of them hang down among her Cloaths , before they were taken from her . The Prisoner called several People , who never had heard of her having wronged any one before . Guilty . [ Branding . See summary . ] 402. Nicholas Heney was indicted for stealing a Cloth Coat , value 5 s. the Goods of John Blackwell : Four Shirts , value 12 s. a Cloth Coat and Waistcoat , value 10 s. a Pair of Leather Breeches , value 5 s. the Goods of John Spearing : A Hat , value 3 s. the Goods of William Dormer . And a Hat edged with Silver , value 8 s. the Goods of James Fortescue , Esq ; June 20 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 403. Thomas Bridge , of St. Andrews , Holbourn , was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on the 5th of June , in and upon Elizabeth , his Wife , did make an Assault , and with a certain Knife , made of Iron and Steal , value 1 d. her the said Elizabeth , in and upon the left Part of the Breast , near the left Pap , feloniously , & c. did strike and stab , giving her a mortal Wound of the Breadth of one Inch , and the Depth of three Inches , of which Wound she instantly died . John Wilsted . The Prisoner , on the 5th of June , came to me , and told me , That his Wife was murdered , and that he had stabbed her in the Breast with a Knife , and that she was dead . I asked him if his Wife was dead ? He said yes , and lay dead on the Floor . He told me , he was eating a Piece of Bread and Cheese , and held his Knife against his Breast ; with the Point outwards , and she flew at him in a violent Passion , and stabbed the Knife into her Breast . I asked him what Knife she was killed with ? And if it was with the Clasp-Knife which he carried in his Pocket ? He said , no , it was with a Butcher 's sharp-pointed Knife with a white Handle , or an Ivory Handle , and he could not find the Knife , nor half a Crown which she had in her Pocket . He seemed to me to be very much in Liquor , and was all over bloody . There was a large Patch of Blood on his Back , and another on his right Leg . I told him , he had either been doing Murder , or had been fighting , and he told me he had not been fighting , - his Wife was murdered . I went with him to the House where he lodg 'd , and asked the Man of the House where the Prisoner 's Wife was ? He told me , she had not been at Home all Night ; why says I , her Husband tells me she is murdered , and lies dead upon the Floor . The Prisoner then told the Man , that his Wife lay dead upon the Floor , but the Chamber-door was lock 'd , and the Prisoner either would not , - or could not find the Key ; so we got a Ladder , and set it up to the Window , and a little Boy went up , and look 'd in , and said , - she was dead upon the Floor . After this I went up , and found it true . I observed the Skin was off his Nose , and off some Part of his Eye-brow . Jury . We desire he may be ask 'd , how long he imagin 'd the Woman had been dead ? Wilsted . She seem 'd to me not to have been long dead . Prisoner . Did not you desire me to go off , and I said I would not , but would go with you , and stay till a Constable came , because I knew myself innocent ? Wilsted . Yes ; I did advise him to go off , and I believe it would have been better for him if he had ; but he insisted upon taking a Trial for it . Jury . Did you ask him for the Key of the Room ? Wilsted . Yes ; and he either would not , or could not produce it ; but it was produced before the Justice . Prisoner . If the Key had been found , they could not have got into the Room ; for there 's an Iron Bar , which runs cross the Back of the Door , and when the Door is shut , and that Bar not taken off , ( which falls into a Hook ) no one can get in , but through the Window . John Thomas . On the 4th of June I was sitting at my own Door , and saw the Prisoner and the Deceased pass by me ; he was in Liquor , and she was not sober . The Prisoner was led home by another Woman , between Eight and Nine at Night . I saw nothing more of them that Night , but the next Morning , about Nine , I saw him come past my House with Mr. Wilsted , and I said , I believed he had been upon the Rake all Night , for he did not seem sober then . After this I saw a Ladder set up , and a Boy went up the Ladder , and told the People the Woman was dead upon the Floor , and lay in her Blood ; then a Woman went up , and got in at the Window , and declar 'd Mrs. Bridge was murder 'd . When the Door was open 'd , I went up , and saw the Woman lying on the Middle of the Floor , - dead , - and cold , - in her Blood . I have liv 'd next Door to them these six Years . Jury . What Character had the Deceased ? Thomas . I never heard any Ill of either of them . Lucretia Eades . On the 4th of June , between Seven and Eight in the Evening , I saw the Prisoner and his Wife come into the House where I live . He was so much in Liquor , that he had like to have fallen down in attempting to sit : A Neighbour that was then in the House told him , if he would go home , she would go with him , which he agreed to , and his Wife , and he , and the Woman went home together . Sometime after this , the Deceased came down Stairs again , and went to the White Horse in Baldwin 's Gardens for two Pots of Beer , which were carry 'd up to their Lodging . I saw no more of them till next Morning , and then , after the Boy that went up the Ladder had told us the Woman was dead , I went up , and found the Deceased on the Floor ; the left Side of her Forehead was blue , there was a little Mark on her right Temple , and a Stab above her right Breast , and her Fingers were all bloody . There were several Knives lying upon the Table , all which were carry 'd before Mr. Poulson . Jury . We ask , whether the Wound went upwards , - or downwards ? Eades . The Wound was above her left Breast , and went downwards . Prisoner . She says she saw us come by between Seven and Eight ; - the former Witness says , - between Eight and Nine ; and as for Beer , we had none that Night . Richard Slakman . Between Eight and Nine at Night , July the 4th , the Prisoner came to me with the Deceased : He was in Liquor , and in attempting to sit , he fell down . The Deceased desired my Wife to get the Prisoner home ; accordingly she led him home , and I follow 'd them in four or five Minutes . The Prisoner asked me to stay and sup with him ; I refused , and he said , - then I should drink with him , and he would have sent for two full Pots of Beer , but I oppos 'd it ; then the Prisoner storm 'd at the Deceased , stamping with his Feet in an angry Manner , and bid her fetch him Half a Pint ; the Deceased ran in great Haste , and fetched half a Pint of Gin and we drank a Dram a-piece out of a broken Tea Cup : There was a Quarter of a Pint left in the Bottle when we went away . 'T was about Half an Hour after Nine when I left them , and they then seem 'd to be in Friendship together . Sarah Mauden . On the 5th of June the Prisoner came to our Shop about Seven o'Clock in the Morning , to buy a Shirt : My Mother keepeth a Cloaths Shop : He pitched upon one , and agreed to give me 16 d. for it : Then he desired he might have the Liberty to put it on in the Entry When he had put it on , he desired me to give him a Bit of Tape to tie the Sleeves : I ty 'd them for him , and then he desired me to cut the Ends of the Tape even , and he told me , - he should be hang 'd in that Shirt . I ask 'd him why ? Not for wronging any body , said he , - for My Case is worse than a Thief 's . I observed the Shirt he pulled off was bloody at the Hands . Prisoner . I remember I went to her Shop , and bought a Shirt , because that which I had on was torn at the Wrists ; but I do n't remember my speaking such Words . Mary Shields . I am a Lodger in the House where this Thing happen 'd : I saw the Prisoner and the Deceased come Home together between Eight and Nine in the Evening : Mrs. Slackman led him Home , for he was very much in Liquor . They had not been long at Home , before I saw the Deceased go out for Half a Pint of Gin , and a Half-penny Candle , and I saw no more of them till Ten o'Clock at Night , and then I saw him , with a Stick in his Hand , carry out his Child , which was dropp 'd that Night near my Daughter 's House . Jury . How old was the Child ? Shields . About Six Years old . Jury . What do you mean by dropping a Child of Six Years old ? Shields . The Child did tell the People ( who found it ) where it lived . That Night I saw no more of him ; but about Twelve at Night I heard the Bar of his Chamber-Door fall , and the Door shut , and I heard somebody go out of the Room . The Reason I have to believe it was the Prisoner who went out , is this ; I heard his Voice when he got in at the Window by a Ladder at Eleven o'Clock , which was an Hour before I heard somebody go out of his Room , and at Twelve I heard the Bar behind the Door fall into the Latch , and somebody went out . The next Morning I met him coming up Stairs ; he was then not sober , and as I pass 'd him upon the Stairs , I saw the Calf of his Leg bloody , and the back of his Coat . The Child was dropp 'd in St. Clement 's Parish ( in the Strand ) and was brought before the Justice when the Prisoner was examined by him . This is the Shirt that was taken from him . Sarah Mauden . I believe this is the Shirt he pull 'd off in our House . A former Witness . He own 'd it was the same , - before Mr. Poulson . The Shirt was produced , but it was so much torn , and was so very foul , that it could not be thoroughly inspected . Hannah Coles . The Prisoner and the Deceased came home that Night , ( I think ) pretty much in Liquor . I lodge in the same House , and not haveing been well , I had taken a Sweat , and went pretty soon to Bed . My Room is over the Prisoner 's , and between Nine and Ten , I heard a Noise in their Room , but not a Noise with Talking , - no Noise of Murder , nor any Groaning , but a Thumping about . There were two or three great Bumpings , which made my Bed shake under me , and I thought the Things upon the Shelves in my Room would have been shook down . I supposed they were fighting , for they were given to quarrel , but I never had any Concerns with them , and I thought 't was no Business of mine . Sometimes they would quarrel , and sometimes they 'd be good Friends . When the Man was sober , he 'd be pretty well , - when he was drunk , he 'd abuse every body , and she was a very passionate Woman . I did not see the Prisoner after this , ( Noise , ) till next Morning , and then he had confess 'd , and had brought People home with him , The Woman was kill 'd , - I saw ; but I did not kill her , and I have no more to say . George Reader . The Morning after the Murder , I was standing at my Door about Eight o'Clock , and saw the Prisoner and Mr. Wilsted come by . I took him to be a Constable , and imagined there had been some Quarrel among the Lodgers . I saw Wilsted go in , and the Prisoner stood at the Door : I having some slender Knowledge of him , he beckon 'd to me ; I went to him and he took me by the Button , ( of my Coat , ) and said , - She 's dead ! Who 's dead , said I ! My Wife , said he ! God forbid , said I ! 'T is true , reply 'd he , and she lies weltring in her Blood , - You 'll come and give me a Pot when I am in Newgate . I took the Prisoner to be a quiet peaceable Man . I am sorry I have so much to say against him . Sarah Miller . The Prisoner has lodged in my House about 16 or 17 Months . I have often heard him and the Deceased quarrel - by way of Words ; but I never saw them fight . She once , indeed , had a black Eye ; but how she came by it , I ca n't tell . On the 4th of June , I saw the Prisoner go out early in the Morning , and I saw him no more that Day , till he was led home by a Woman , very much in Liquor , and his Wife walk 'd before him . A little after Nine ( the same Evening ) he came down Stairs into my Shop , with his Child , and said , Landlady , - Shall I leave my Candle upon the Counter ? I ask 'd him where he was going at that time o'Night with the Child ? He said , he was going to carry the Child to its Mother , who was at the Child 's Aunt 's , and he was then going to her . I desired him not to stay , for I should shut up Shop at Eleven , and he told me , he should return immediately . Jury . How did he appear , when he came down with the Child ? Miller . Very brisk ; - but he was in Liquor . Jury . Did not you know that his Wife was then at Home ? Miller . No ; I did not know but she might have gone out again . About Eleven he return 'd , and took his Candle ; I ask 'd him , what he had done with the Child ? He told me , he had left it with his Wife , and asked me if I had any Key that would open his Door ; - for he hadleft the Key of his Room , ( he said ) with his Wife . I told him I had no Key that would do ; so he got a Ladder , and set it up against the Window , and went in ; He was then in Liquor , and I was afraid he would have tumbled ; for he work 'd the Ladder among the Sugar-Loaves at the Top of the Window , and I was forced to hold it , left it should tilt . When he got to the Top of the Ladder , he threw up the Sash , and tumbled in at the Window , Head over Heels ; which made the Neighbours laugh , and say he had got a Fall . When I went in Doors , my Husband said , - 't was a little odd that his Wife should be gone , and his Child gone , and that he should get in at the Window ; I am afraid he has some Design to rob the Lodging ( for it was ready furnished ) ; I told him , we would go to Bed , and I would keep awake . About Twelve , or a little before , I heard his Door go , and somebody come out of his Room , and open the Street Door , and go out ; upon which I got up , and fasten 'd it , that he should come in no more that Night . I heard no more of him 'till next Morning , when he came with Wilsted ( the first Witness ) , and then a Woman got in at the Window . Prisoner 's DEFENCE . Prisoner . My Lord , I had been out with my Wife the best Part of that Day , on some Affairs of her own , and we went to several Places , where we drank pretty much : Between Eight and Nine in the Evening we came home , as the Witnesses have said . That Man 's Wife , ( Slackman 's ) came Home with me , and he followed . I ask 'd him to stay and sup with me upon some Roast-Beef , which we had had for Dinner on Sunday : He refused , and then I press 'd him to drink , but he would not : May be , says I , you do n't chuse to drink Beer ; fetch me , says I , ( to my Wife ) Half a Pint of Geneva ; she did , and had like to have tumbled down Stairs at the same time . When Slackman and his Wife were gone , I told my Wife she had drank a great deal , and she had better eat something . No , - she would not eat , but would have another Dram : Wo n't it be too much for you ? No , she said , She 'd drink t'other Dram , and would then go to Bed . Well , says I , if you wont eat , I and the Child will . The Child would have Bread and Cheese ; so I cut a Slice for it , and another for my self . She was then standing at the End of the Table ; I was standing at some Distance from it , and we were talking together , without Passion . At last she began to mention a Difference she had had with one of the Witnesses , and I was for mitigating the Matter ; upon which she grew uneasy , and I seeing that , said , Well , we 'll omit talking of this till To-morrow . I stood , my Lord , in this Posture - 't is my usual Posture , with my Knife in one Hand , resting on my Breast , and my Bread and Cheese in the other , - 't is my usual Way of standing - I saw her Countenance change , and bid her go to Bed , but she stepp 'd forward , and fell like a Lump of Lead upon me , and her Head came under my Chin . She was a short Woman , and my Knife took her just above her Stays ; had I been farther from her , she would have fallen on her Face . 'T was about 10 o'Clock when she fell on my Knife and after that , I carry 'd out my Child . Jury . Was the Child produced before the Justice ? Prisoner . Yes , it was before Mr. Poulson , but it is not seven Years old . - After my Wife had received the Wound , she fell from me ; I withdrew the Knife , and put it into the Sheath , and clapp 'd it into the Bosom of my Waistcoat . She fell from me on her Temple , and I clapp 'd my Hand to her Mouth , and found she was dead , without either a Sigh or a Groan . As she fell , her Cloaths flew up to her Head , so I laid her strait , and then the Child crying out , - O my Mammy ! - my Mammy ! I took him up in my Arms , and carry 'd him to my Brother 's Door , in Arundel street , where I knock 'd at the Door , and left him , before any body came to the Door , because I did not care any of the People there should see me . When I left the Child at the Door , I told him , I would only go and get a Pint of Beer , and then would come to him again . Then I went home , and got a Ladder , and having got in at the Window , I took what Money there was in the Room , and went out again . Then I went to the Watch-house , and told them what had happen 'd , but they would not take me into Custody , but bid me go home to Bed . I rambled about all Night very unneasy , and could not rest : Had I had any Mind to have escap 'd , I could have gone down to Gravesend , and have got Employment , but knowing myself innocent , I resolved to take a Trial . After this , I bought me a Shirt , and went to Mr. Wilsted 's , and told him what had happen 'd ; and I desired him to go home with me , and acquaint the People of it , and that an Officer might be got to apprehend me : He advis 'd me to get off , but I would not ; I went with him , and waited till I was took into Custody . I never us 'd her ill , nor gave her Blows ; - 't is my Nature to be quiet with all who will be quiet with me . I did not drink a Drop of the Geneva that was sent for , and what was left of it , was found by those who went into the Room . Beer is what I like at all Times . Jury . One would think it more natural for the Prisoner to have dropp 'd the Knife , after the Accident , than to have put it first into the Sheath , and then into his Bosom . Prisoner . It was as quickly put there as any where . The Surgeon was call 'd , but Mr. Poulson 's Clerk inform 'd the Court , that he was subpaena 'd to Westminster upon a Trial there . John Reader . I have known the Prisoner about two Months , and during that Time he had a general good Character . As for his Wife , I think I never saw so turbulent , passionate a Woman in my Life : I have heard her say to the Child , damn you , you little Hell cat Dog , - curse your Blood , - and such Expressions I have heard her use , two or three Days before the Accident . Samuel Freeman . The Prisoner has work 'd for me many Years : He is a Razor and Penknife Maker , and alwas behaved well . Since this Accident , I have heard that he had another Wife . George Lewis had known him 16 or 17 Years , and always behaved civilly . He had heard of his having another Wife . Guilty , Death . 404. David Roberts was indicted , for that he , devising and intending our Lord the King and his Subjects craftily and traiterously to deceive and defraud , on the 31st of January , in the Tenth Year of his Majesty 's Reign , four Pieces of Gold , call 'd Guineas , with a certain File , and other Instruments , for wicked Lucre and Gain-sake , feloniously and traiterously did file and diminish , contrary to the Statute , & c. The Council for the King having open 'd the Charge , and the Nature of the * Offence , the Witnesses were called . * This Offence is made High-Treason , by 5 Eliz . cap . 11 . Yet without Corruption of Blood , or Loss of Dower ; and the Judgment is the same as in petit Treason , to be drawn and hanged . John Sandall . I belong to the Mint . John Carter ( who was concern 'd with the Prisoner in filing Guineas ) having made an Information , and put the Prisoner therein , I got a Warrant to apprehend him . After much Time spent in Enquiry after him , I heard he had liv 'd lately at Islington . I enquired at Islington , and found that he lived next Door to the The Three Hats ; but when I came to the House , the Neighbours told me , he had been gone two or three Days from thence , and had mov 'd all his Goods off . John Carter . I have known the Prisoner above three Years . When I got first acquainted with him , he had a Habitation at Coventry ; that was in April three Years ago , but he was personally in London , for he had kept an Inn at Country , and came up to Town , because he could not carry on his Business in the Country any longer , and he employ 'd me to go down there , and sell off his Goods . When I got to Coventry , I found most of his Goods were detain 'd by his Creditors , the rest I and his Wife sold . I staid there 17 Days , and at my Return to London , I found him in Cold-Bath Fields ; he came down once to Coventry , while I was there , but he did not stay above Half an Hour , for fear of being arrested . Counc . Give an Account what Discourse you had with him , with Relation to this Business . Carter . I had no Discourse with him , till I came to London : He had then 130 l. due to him , and from the Time of his coming to Town , to his receiving this Money , we had frequent Conversation about diminishing the Coin . The first Time I saw him was at the Duke 's Head in St. John 's Square ; he sent for me thither about selling his Goods ; but when he received his Money , he liv 'd in the Broad Sanctuary , Westminster : He liv 'd first in Cold-Bath Fields , then upon Saffron-hill , then at Westminster , and afterwards at Hoxton . As soon as he received this 130 l. - he and I were to go Partners in diminishing the Coin ; and accordingly he went about taking a House for that Purpose in December 1736 , and did take one in the Broad Sanctuary , after he had received the Money . At that Time he owed me five Guineas , and I went to his House there , and asked for him ; he was not at home , but I saw he had provided Charcoal and three or four Crucibles , I saw them in his Lodging , up two Pair of Stairs ; one of the Crucibles had been used : They are to melt Gold and Silver in , in a Charcoal Fire ; common Coal will do , but Charcoal will do it sooner . I went from his House to the Stable yard , near the Abbey , to look for him , and there I found him at an Alehouse , where we talked about our Design of filing Guineas : I let him into the Affair , and desired him to pay me the five Guineas he owed me . Two or three Days afterwards , I went to him again , and he told me , he had found out my Method of doing it , but he could not do it as well as I ; he told me likewise , that he had try 'd the Liquor , Aqua Regis , but he could not make that do ; then he took me up Stairs , and shew 'd me how he could do them , and he fil 'd two or three Guineas and an 18 s. Piece in my Presence . This was the latter End of January 1736-7 . Counc . What Quantity did you commonly take from a Guinea ? Carter . We commonly took a Shilling a-piece from them . Counc . Had you a Vice to put them in ? Carter . To hatch them afterwards we had . I met him once afterwards , but I did not see him work . Counc . Then you do n't put it into a Vice to file them ? Carter . No : He held it in his Hand , while he fil 'd it , and placed a Sheet of Paper under it , to catch the Dust that fell . There might be about 18 Grains taken off from the three Guineas , which I saw him file , and when he had filed them , he put them into a Vice , and edg 'd them . He fil 'd them with a Bastard File , and edg 'd them with a three square File , both which he procur 'd himself . One File is enough to last three Months , and a great deal longer . Counc And in what Manner were they done ? Carter . Very badly : But after he had fil 'd them , he wrapped up the Dust , and then we went to the Fountain , in King-street , where I told him his Method would not do , and that I could not put off any of them , for his Edging did not at all imitate a regular Mill . Some have been done so well , that no one could discover them , but the Work upon these was not like Milling . The Edging was not close enough , nor at regular Distances . After this , he solicited me to come and improve him : I told him , if he would give me the five Guineas he owed me , I would come in a few Days , and improve him . But I thought he intended to be a Villain to me , so I parted from him , and saw him no more , till I li't of him in Monmouth-street : Then he told me he was going to live in the King's-Bench , and I afterwards saw him , within the Rules , in the Mulberry Garden . I have been up Stairs in his House at that Place a great many Times , and have often seen him file Guineas there . The first Time I was there , I saw him file five or six , and he had improved himself very much . Counc . Did he or you make use of these Guineas after he had filed them ? Carter . Yes : He gave me half a Crown out of the Money he had got by his Filings , and then we went to an Inn , at the End of St. George 's Fields , and had a Pint of Wine ; and from thence we went to the Three Queens and drank again , and after that , we drank at the Ship , in St. George 's Fields , and at a House by the Falcon Stairs , at which Places we put off the Guineas when we paid our Reckoning Counc . What did he do with the Dust ? Carter . I ca n't tell : I told him I sold mine at one Mr. Carpenter 's , a Refiner , in Foster Lane , and that I always put a Bit of Copper , or some other Metal into it , to disguise it , and that the Refiner should not find it Standard . Counc . When did you see him last before you surrendered ? Carter . About three or four Months before . The last Time I saw him , was at the Duke 's Head in St. John 's Square . The Advertisement in the Gazette encouraged me to surrender , and so I sent a Letter to Mr. North , and he came to me the next Day , or the Day after , and I surrendered myself , and was in Custody ten or twelve Weeks . The first Time I saw Mr. North , I impeached the Prisoner . The Advertisement was read which was published in the Gazzette , of Tuesday October the 24th , 1738 . Prisoner . Ask him who hired him to go down to Coventry . Carter . He hired me , and gave me a Note of his Hand , before I set out . One Dowth brought me first acquainted with the Prisoner , because he thought me the properest Person to sell off his Goods . Mr. North . I am the Person mentioned in the Gazette , to whom the Persons advertised were to surrender . In August last , a Person came to me , and said he could help me to Carter , and I gave him Encouragement to do so . At length I received two or three Letters from Carter , expressing his Desire to come and make a Discovery and upon this I went into an Alley , in Moorfields , and there I found him , and he told me the whole of the Affair , much in the same Manner as he has done now . He mentioned the Houses where the Prisoner had lived , and where he had filed Guineas . I sent Mr. Sandell to see if he could find out the Prisoner , but he was gone off , and I heard nothing of him , till he was taken at Bath . Anthony Byam . I know nothing of the Prisoner , before he hired a House of me , in the Stable-Yard , at Westminster ; he lived in it about a Fortnight , and did not seem to me to follow any Employment , but to have been a Man under Misfortunes , and Bailiffs , ( as I thought ) used to be after him . He begged of me to let him leave the House . I keep a publick House within three or four Doors of that which he took of me , and I have seen Carter with him several Times at my House , - two or three Times in the Fortnight . I never observed him to sit up o'Nights , and I have been in his Room above Stairs , - not in his Bed-chamber , - and I never saw any Charcoal there . Indeed , two or three Days after he left the House there was a buzzing about , of his being a Coiner , or that he followed some such Matters . The people talked likewise about Carter , for he had been with him , ( as I understood ) at several other Places . Prisoner . Ask Mr. Byam if he ever saw Carter in my House ? Byam . No ; for Carter used to come to my House , and send for the Prisoner . Prisoner . Were the Windows in my House never opened ? Byam . I never saw them open . Counc . Did Carter and the Prisoner never come to your House together ? Byam . No ; to the best of my Knowledge they never did : Carter used to come and send for him . Evan Bedward . I keep a publick House , - the Duke 's Head in St. John 's Square . I know both Carter and the Prisoner ; the Prisoner lodg 'd at my House , and Carter came to him there several Times , about his ( the Prisoner 's ) Affairs at Coventry . I have seen them together , both in Publick and Private ; sometimes they 'd be together once or twice in a Fortnight or three Weeks , sometimes oftener . The Prisoner lodged in my House several Months : He is a Carpenter by Trade , and I have seen him with a Saw in his Hand . Mark Rogers . I keep a Publick House in St. John 's Street , above Hick 's Hall , I have Occasion to remember the Prisoner ; he came to my House in December , two Years ago , and brought one Robert Brinkley with him ; they both went into the Kitchen , and sat down : Then the Prisoner ask 'd my Wife , Whether she could give him Silver for seven or eight Guineas : Yes , said she , for twenty , if they are good ; upon which he pulled out a Parcel of Guineas , and 3 l. 12 s. Pieces : I was backward behind the Skittle-Ground , so she called me to the Prisoner , who immediately cry 'd - Your humble Servant , Mr. Rogers . I do n't know you , said I ; but I know you , said the Prisoner . - Can you give me Silver for some Gold ? I told him I would , if the Money was good ; so he put down eight Guineas , and a 3 l. 12 s. Piece upon the Table ; I took up four of them , and one of them was so rough it prick 'd my Fingers : Hey ! hey ! said I , what 's the Meaning of this ! What Tricks have you been at here ! I put on my Spectacles , and view 'd them ; Why this is rascally Work , said I ; some slovenly Fellow did this , I could have done it better myself - some of them were filed into the very Letters . Is not the Gold good , said the Prisoner ? I told him I believed it was . Do you apprehend I did it , said the Prisoner ? No , said I , not in such a publick Place as this ; if you had , I would have apprehended you , - and I wish I had done it then . There was one Guinea dated 1732 , which was as fresh as if it had but just come out of the Mint , and that poor Piece was mangled deeper than any of the rest . Friend , said I , to the Prisoner , give me leave to go and weigh these four Guineas , for he had took up all the rest , while I was looking at these . He told me , I might weigh them with all his Heart ; so I went to Mr. Gregory , the Tobacconist , he had Grains and other Weights , but he had no Guinea Weight ; therefore he put his Hand into the Drawer , and took out 50 or 60 Guineas , and weighed these Guineas against several of his . Three of the Prisoner 's Guineas wanted Six or Eight Grains , and the new Guinea would not do at all ; Mr. Gregory 's went down bump against it . Upon this Mr. Gregory came with me to the Prisoner , and ask 'd him if the Guineas were his ? He told him they were ; then Mr. Gregory weigh 'd them before his Face - Well , says the Prisoner , may be they are too light , - but they are good Gold - I took them of Sir Francis Child - It looks very ugly , said , I - you have a good many of them - pray where do you live ? He told me he lived in Montague Close , by St. Mary Overy 's Church ; but he did not know any body there , for he said he had lived there but a little while . After this he told us he lived in the Minories , but he had not lived there long . While we were disputing , in came Henry Burden , and said he knew the Prisoner ; but the Prisoner would not know him . Why , says Burden , you are my next door Neighbour , and you know how to use Charcoal , - I have seen a good deal go into your House . The Prisoner then told us he had a sick Child , and the Charcoal was to air the Room ; Burden , after this , pulled out a Crucible , and asked him if he knew how to use that ? The Prisoner said , - No ; he did not know the Use of them ; and , after a good deal of Talk , he told us it would be a good natured Action to give him his Money again , and would prevent a great deal of Trouble both to him and me . Well , says the Gentleman , if you 'll produce any one Guinea out of the Parcel in your Pocket that is Weight , you shall have them again . No , no , hold there , says the Prisoner , - you have got enough already . We told him again , he should go free , if he could produce one Guinea that was Weight , But he made so many Entreaties , that at last I gave him his Money again , and let him go about his Business . Some time after this he had the Assurance to serve me with the Copy of a Writ for Defamation , and he trump 'd up Evidence against me for Perjury , and brought an Action against me for giving him his Money again . Counc . Was you ever in the Prisoner 's Room ? Rogers . I was in a Place which the Landlord told me was his Apartment , in Pear tree Street , by Brick Lane , but I saw no Instruments ( or Tools ) there . There was only a Hole burnt just by the Window . Prisoner . I serv 'd every Soul in the House with Copies of Writs , and Rogers produced a Woman with Child , before the Lord Chief Justice Lee , in his Behalf , whom I never saw in my Life . Rogers . He serv 'd every body he saw in my House with Copies , and swore there was but three Persons present when the Guineas were offer 'd , whereas there was 10 or a Dozen there at the same time . Mr. Edward Gregory , a Tobacconist , in St. John's-street , confirm 'd Mr. Rogers 's Evidence ; and declar 'd , that the four Guineas which were carry 'd back to the Prisoner were the same identical Guineas which Mr. Rogers brought to him : And Mr. Rogers added , that the Guineas he had from the Prisoner to change were the very same which he carry 'd to Mr. Gregory . Prisoner . I produced the four Guineas before the Lord Chief Justice Lee , and they were Weight , and were sworn to be the same that I offer 'd them . Counc . Yes , that 's true . They were sworn to be the same by Brinkley , who was with you , and my Lord Chief Justice committed him . Prisoner . I try 'd them for Scandal before the Lord Chief Justice Lee , and Rogers and his Evidences swore they did not say the Guineas were diminished , - that was the Case . Mr. Gregory 's Evidence agreed exactly with Mr. Rogers 's . Edward Burdet confirm 'd both the former Witnesses . He happen 'd to go with two Friends to drink at Mr. Rogers 's when the Prisoner was there with his Guineas , and his Evidence was the same with theirs . He added , that the Prisoner abused Mr . Burden for calling him his Neighbour ; but when the Thing was plain , he beg 'd he would drink with him , and told him it should not cost him a Farthing , but the Witness refus 'd , and told the Prisoner he did not like him . He farther observ 'd , that Roberts had Charcoal frequently brought in ; that he always appear 'd drest like a Gentleman , and Brinkley us 'd to go on his Errands . And tho ' the Prisoner ( upon his being tax 'd with using Charcoal ) had declar 'd he had no Grate in the House , yet the Witness depos 'd , he saw one carry 'd in , and the Person by whom it was sent was by him ( the Witness ) directed with it to the Prisoner 's House . This Witness farther inform 'd the Court , that he seldom saw the Prisoner 's Windows open ; but once ( on a Sunday ) he saw him at the Window , in an odd Motion , sweating , ( tho ' in Winter-time ) and concluded he must have been doing something at the Fire . Thomas Ubank , who lived with Messrs Allcraft and Stevens , Refiners , in Foster Lane , deposed , That the Prisoner had sold Gold to them several Times . The first Gold he sold them was Rings , and such things , which were melted for him . That he had brought three Ounces of Gold , at several other Times ; particularly , at the latter End of the Year 1737 , and the Beginning of the Year 1738 . He believed he had brought Gold to sell four or five Times , in all ; and it was always a little worse than Standard ; for if it had been Standard , it would have been suspected . He said further , That one Prestland was the Man who first brought him to their House . Mr. North informed the Court that he had been to enquire after this Prestland , but his Master had acquainted him , that Prestland had absconded , and had sent him a Letter , in which he declar 'd that he had got out of the Way , because he would not be subpoena 'd upon this Trial , as a Witness . The Letter was produced and read . July 19 . 1739 . SIR , `` I Am told , That Roberts will be try 'd To-morrow , `` and that I shall be subpoena 'd ; so I `` think to keep away till the Trial is over . I `` shall keep out of the Way till To-morrow Afternoon ; `` then I shall wait on you . I am , Your Humble Servant , GEORGE PRASTLAND . Carter informed the Court , that he saw Prestland last Monday Morning , and , That he ( Prestland ) told him he would come if Mr. North sent for him ; but if he did come , he should be of Service to Roberts , for he had been with him at the Pawn-Broker 's to buy Gold . Mr. Cooling deposed , That he had went to the Bath , last Spring , and saw the Prisoner there , whom he had known before : And having seen the Advertisement , he informed Mr. Baron Thomson ( who was then at Bath ) that he had seen the Prisoner : That he got proper Assistance , and went to the Prisoner 's Lodging ; That he being above Stairs , his Wife called out to him to take Care of himself ; That he stood at the Top of the 2d Pair of Stairs with an Axe or a Hatchet in his Hand , and said , - God damn you , Gentlemen , stand off , - I 'll chop down the first Man that comes here ; That they went for a Gun , and having loaded it , one Mr. Mullins clapped it to the Prisoner 's Breast ; upon which he surrendered . Henry Woolcot and Richard Jefferies confirmed Mr. Cooling 's Evidence , with Relation to the Apprehending the Prisoner . They both added , That he told them ( when he was in Custody ) he knew there was a Reward for taking David Roberts , and they were welcome to it . Elizabeth Bosworth , with whom the Prisoner lived in Cold bath Fields , deposed , That they liv 'd two Months in her House , and paid her honestly ; she observed they were in Necessity , and she never saw any Gold , or Crucibles in his Room , tho ' she had often been in it ; That they never made any Fire , but eat their Victuals with her . She farther said , that she nursed a Child for him , when he lived in Pear-tree-street , and that he had no Grate in that House ; That the Prisoner used to go out in the Morning to Work , and came home o'Nights , and employ 'd Men in his Business . Richard Williams had known the Prisoner three Years . He lodged in the Witnesses 's House three Years ago , but knew little of him since that Time . David Wallis , a Peruke-maker , had made a light Bob-wig , and an almost black one for the Prisoner , who paid him three Guineas for them . John Taylor , of Pear-tree-street , got acquainted with the Prisoner last Michaelmas was twelve Months . He kept a Publick House , and had changed many Guineas for the Prisoner . In particular , he had changed four Guineas at a Time for him , the Day he opened ; which Guineas he had paid away , and they had not been objected to . Francis Dawson deposed , That the Prisoner took a House of him at Islington , and left it before the Advertisement came out , because Mr. Rogers had sued him to an Execution . John Wallis had worked under the Prisoner four Years ago , as a Carpenter , but he knew little of him since . Elizabeth Bosworth added , that she had been in every Room in the Prisoner 's House , except the Garret , and she never had seen any Charcoal there . Guilty , Death . 405. Sarah Kingman was indicted for privately stealing three Shillings from the Person of Moses Wheeler , June 17 . Moses Wheeler . She picked my Pocket of three Shillings , and took it out by Violence . 'T was on the 17th of June , at the George Ale-house , in Queen Street , next Cheapside . I called there between Three and Four in the Morning , for a Pint of Beer , and the Prisoner being standing at the Bar , with the Landlord of the House , I ask 'd her to drink . She said , she did not care if she did ; so she drank Part of that Pint , and then I called for another , and she drank Part of that too . When the second Pint was out , I gave the Drawer a Shilling , and he gave me Nine-pence out of it . In the mean time a Man came in and sat down in the Box with her , - I suppose he was one of her Gang , - and he told me he would spend a Penny with me , for a Pint of Twopenny . The Prisoner was then in the Inside of the Box , with the Fellow , and I was on the outside . He threw down his Penny on the Table , and I pulled out my Money , to take a Penny to put to it . Upon which she flung her Hands about my Neck , and said , - my Dear , you shall feel me ; and at the same time she switched three Shillings out of my Pocket , and flung herself that Minute from me . I told her she wanted to pick my Pocket , and I looked to see what Money was there , and missed three Shillings . I charged her with taking my Money , and put my Hand down her Bosom to see if it was there but it was not . Then I turned her round in the Box , and said , - before you go , I will have my Money , or Satisfaction . She immediately sat herself down , and pulled out a Box , like a Tobacco-box , and opened it ; there was about fifteen or sixteen Shillings in it ; and she asked me if that was my Money ? After this she stooped , and shifted some down by her Side , and then she cry 'd , - now damn you , - you Son of a Bitch , - I will go with you to the Compter , and away she went to the Poultry Compter ( a little before 5 o'Clock ) and rapped at the Wicket ; the Door was presently opened , and she was let in , but they shut me out . There happened to be a Man at this Time sitting at the Compter Gate , and I desired him to go for my Brother : He came to me , and then we knocked at the Gate , and asked for the Woman ; they deny 'd her , but in the Morning we got her out , and took her to Wood street Compter ; and as we were going along , she took out her Box , with the Money , and said , - here you Son of a Bitch , here 's your three Shillings again , - I believe you want a Shilling more than I do , and I 'll give you another Shilling to take it , and she up with her Fist and gave me such a Stroke on the Face , that she swelled up my Eyes . Jury . We would desire to know if the Prosecutor had been out all Night ? Wheeler . I had been out with Work that Night , and had come from Dick 's Shore , at Lime-House : I parted with my Master there , about Twelve o'Clock . Jury . Upon your Oath did not you know that this George Ale-house was a disorderly house ? Wheeler . No : I never was in the House but once before in my Life . The Doors were open , and I was dry with walking so far ; so I went in for a Pint of Beer . I found the Prisoner used to keep Company with one Frank Smith , a Smuggler , in the Compter , and that the People at the Compter let her out and in . When she had done Mischief , she used to whip down thither to be screened . Richard Lawrence . The Prosecutor sent a Watchman for me , about Five o'Clock in the Morning , and I went directly to the Poultry Compter , where I found him keeping Guard , lest the Woman should be let out . He told me she had picked his Pocket of three Shillings and some Half-Pence . I asked the Turnkey what Time they let People in , to visit the Prisoners . He told me at Six o'Clock . Why , says I , this Woman came in without a Constable , and 't is not half an Hour past Five now : You let People out to go a robbing ; the Woman is in the Gaol , and and I must look for her . He said he would not look for her , and bid me get in , and look for her myself ; and be damned ; I searched , and could not find her ; then I said I would complain to the Sheriff . D - mn it , he did not care if I did , and one Fellow was going to strike me . After this , we search 'd for her again , and at last we found her in the Prison , a-bed with a Man . When we had got her out , she said , - now , damn you , what do you want with me , you foolish Dog , - you can only return me to the Place where you found me , - you can only send me home again , no , my dear , said I , you sha'n't go home again , we 'll move you to Woodstreet Compter . As we were carrying her thither , she would go cross Honey Lane Market ; O , said I , I find you know the nearest Way thither too ; and when we were got into the Market , she pull 'd out her Box , - Here , - you poor Dog , said she , I know you want Money , - here 's your three Shillings again , and a Shilling more for you to take them , and I will go about my Business . No , my Dear , said I , you shall not go . Why , said she , you do n't know , you foolish Dog , what you 're about , I let my - out to be bowl 'd at , and you are to be one of the Bowlers : And when we got her near Sir William Biller 's Office , she struck Wheeler in the Face , and gave him a black Eye . At the Compter she was well known ; the People there cry 'd , - how do you do , Moll ? but her right Name is Sarah Kingman . When we carry 'd her before Alderman Parsons , she beg 'd hard to be sent again to the Compter , but he sent her to Newgate , and when we came under Newgate , she watch 'd her Opportunity , and gave the Prosecutor another Blow in the Face , and bid him kiss her - , now he had done his worst , and she would be revenged on him . Mr. Ravis , the Constable , depos 'd , that the Prisoner was a notorious Offender ; that she had been once transported by the Name of Sarah How . He confirm 'd the Account given of her impudent Behaviour , and of her beating Wheeler , as they were carrying her to Woodstreet Compter , and to Newgate . He said , the Prosecutor was as sober as any Man could be . Guilty , Death . The Jury recommended her for Mercy . 407.
