William Brown and Moses Davis , of St. Paul Covent Garden , were indicted for stealing 30 Tame Pheasants , of the Value of 3 l. the Property of John Crew the younger , Esq ; knowing them to be tame , Nov. 19 . John Hill . Moses Davis told me , that upon the 15th of Dec. at Night , himself and his Partner William Brown , stole 15 Brace of Pheasants belonging to Mr . Crew ; and that he held the Bag while Brown put them in . He likewise informed me , that when they got a little Way from Mr . Crew 's House they killed 21 , and the rest they brought to Town alive . Q . Did they tell you from whence they took them ? Mr. Hill . They said they took them out of Mr . Crew 's Pens in the Garden . Q . Where did Mr . Crew keep these Pheasants ? Mr. Hill . I am his Servant , and we have Pens made for them in the Garden , which are about the Compass of this Court . Pris . Davis . Did he ever see me about the Place , or ever hear an ill Character of me before ? Mr. Hill . No . Holt Crowther . Mr . Crew 's Servant ( Hill ) informing me that his Master had been robb 'd of some Pheasants , we agreed together to go to Mr. Deveil and ask his Advice . He directed us to the Gatehouse to enquire for Moses Davis : We accordingly went thither , and Davis was brought down to us , and he acknowledg 'd that himself and Brown were concern 'd in this Fact . Q . Did he mention Mr . Crew 's Name ? Crowther . I mention 'd that Mr . Crew had lost 15 Brace of Pheasants from Farnham-Royal , and he then owned that himself and Brown took them out of the Pens , and that he held the Bag while Brown put them into it . He likewise said , that he went that Way some Time ago , and heard the Cock Pheasants crow , which brought him to the Pens now . That he brought 9 only out of the 30 alive to Town , and had fed them with Bread and Meat at the Cart and Horse in St. Giles 's . Thomas Green . On the 16th of Dec. the two Prisoners came to my Master , Mr. Lipscomb 's Shop in St. James 's Market , and offer 'd 6 Pheasants for Sale . I had before this seen an Advertisement of some Pheasants that had been lost , upon which I charg 'd a Constable with them , and carried them before Mr. Deveil , who committed them to the Gatehouse for farther Examination . Q . Which of the Prisoners offer 'd the Pheasants to sell ? Green . To the best of my Knowledge it was the tall Man in the Wig , that is Brown , and he told me he bred them himself . I imagined at first that these were the Earl of Essex 's Pheasants , therefore I went to his Lordship 's House , but he not being at Home , we took the Pheasant-Keeper with us , and went directly before Mr. Deveil , and before we got there , Brown contradicted what he had told me , and said he bought the Pheasants on the Road . Q When Brown was before Mr. Deveil did he confess any Thing ? Green . Not that I heard . Davis confessed that he stole them , and said they were not my Lord Essex 's , but Mr . Crew 's . Jervis Morris . I keep the Horse and Cart in St. Giles 's , and the Prisoner Brown was my Lodger . Q . Was you present when Davis was before the Justice ? Morris . I was there Part of the Time , but did not hear him confess any Thing . Mr. Hill . The Confession which I speak of was not before Mr. Deveil , but at the Gatehouse , and he repeated the same next Day before Mr. Deveil . Joshua Brogdon . When the 2 Prisoners were brought before the Colonel the second Time , my Lord Essex was present , and Davis began to tell the whole Truth , and desired to be admitted an Evidence . Brown then desir 'd that he might , and each of them seem 'd to be in a great Hurry to speak , but when Brown perceived that neither of them would be admitted to give Evidence , he said to Davis , now you have begun tell the whole Truth . Then Davis describ 'd the Walk to Farnham-Royal , and confessed that himself and Brown stole about 15 Brace of Pheasants from Mr . Crew 's Pens . Q . Did Brown confess any Thing ? Mr. Brogdon . Yes , he own 'd that he was present when Davis took the Pheasants . Q Were there any Menaces or Threats made Use of to induce them to make this Confession ? Mr. Brogdon . No , none at all , when they were first before Mr. Deveil , Davis was asked , whether he was willing to be an Evidence , and he refused . Pris . Davis . Did he not hear us called Deer-stealers ? Mr. Brogdon . There was no such Word mention 'd . Thomas Cutler confirmed Mr. Brogdon 's Deposition . Mr. Deveil . When these 2 Persons were first brought before me , Davis desir 'd to speak with me in private , and then began to tell me of this Robbery at Farnham-Royal . I told him , if he would be an Evidence concerning my Lord Essex 's Pheasants , I would on Account of his Family admit him to be one ; but he absolutely denied that he knew any Thing of that Robbery ; upon which I committed him to the Gatehouse . A Day or two afterwards there came full Evidence of both Robberies , and I then had the Prisoners again before me . Davis then confessed Mr . Crew 's Robbery , and describ 'd the Place in such a manner , that it was known to be Farnham Royal , and discover 'd the Poulterers where the Pheasants were sold . David Read . I was present when my Lord Essex was with the Prisoners before Mr. Deveil , and when Davis had gone a great Way in his Confession , Brown bid him go on , and tell the whole . The Prisoners in their Defence attempted to prove their buying the Pheasants on the Road , but it not being done to the Satisfaction of the Jury , they were both found Guilty . They were a 2d Time indicted for stealing 19 tame Pheasants , value 3 l. the Property of the Rt . Hon . William Earl of Essex , Dec. 19 . The Prisoners were convicted on this Indictment likewise , and accordingly receiv 'd Sentence of Transportation for 7 Years . 3.

Thomas Pinks , and Stephen Jenkins , were indicted for assaulting Francis Simmonds on the King 's Highway , in the Parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him 36 Fowls , val . 2 l. 10 s. a Sack , val . 1 s. - a pair of hawking Bags , val . 9 d , a Knife , val . 2 d , and 1 s. 3 d , the Goods and Money of the said Simmonds ; and a Guinea and 3 l. the Money of Persons unknown , Dec. 1st , Francis Simmonds . I am a Higler . About six Weeks ago I was coming to Town with a parcel of Fowls , and within a quarter of a Mile of Shoreditch , I was attack 'd by the two Prisoners at the Bar . Pinks knock 'd me off my Horse , and led him to a Ditch , and then search 'd my Pockets . I am certain they are the Men , for the little one ( Jenkins ) beat me several Times over the Head with his Fist and Pistol . They took from me 4 l. in Money , ( which was all in Silver except a Guinea ; ) and that I brought up to Town to pay away for a Person that deals with me . I likewise lost 15 d. of my own Money , four dozen of Fowls all but five , a Sack , a pair of Hawking-bags and a Knife which were all my Property . Pris . Pinks . He says he was robb 'd 6 Weeks ago , and it is 8 Weeks since he accused us of the Robbery . Simmonds . I ca n't tell the Time exactly : I was so much abused , that I have not been myself since . John Haine , Constable . When Pinks was first taken into Custody , I found upon him about 27 s. in Silver and some Half-pence . I asked him how he came by it , and he said he had sav 'd it out of his Labour . I told him , if it was so , he had no Reason for making me come after him so often for Money for the Watch . I look 'd upon the Money , and found a very remarkable half Crown , which I told him I would keep and shew to the Justice : I happen 'd at that Time to be busie , and sent for two of my Headboroughs , and gave the Money to Mr. Edwards , who has kept it in his Custody ever since . Richard Edwards . I being Headborough , search 'd Pinks 's House for some Fowls that were lost . When I came in , I found Pink 's at Dinner with four Fowls on the Table ready dress 'd . I took them before the Justice , but there being no body that could swear to the Fowls , the Prisoners were discharg 'd . The Justice took an Inventory of the Things , and the Tuesday following , the old Man ( Simmonds ) came to Town and swore to the Money . The Prisoners then absconded for eight Days , and when they came up to Town again I took them . This is the half Crown that Mr. Haine deliver 'd to me . Haine . This half Crown I took out of Pinks 's Pocket , and deliver 'd it to Mr. Edwards . Simmonds . I had this half Crown in my Pocket when I was robb 'd ; there is a cut on the Head that I know it by . Pinks . Ask the Prosecutor how long he had this Money in his Custody ? Simmonds . I have had it 5 or 6 Weeks off and on . Q . When did you receive this Money to bring to Town ? Simmonds . I was robb 'd on the Monday Night , and I receiv 'd the Money on the Saturday before . This half Crown I had receiv 'd several Times , and it has been refus 'd , because it was not good , and I put it into my Pocket then to make up my Money . Pris . Jenkins . I am innocent of the Matter ; and it is my Opinion that I was a bed and a sleep when the Robbery was committed . Both Guilty , Death , 6. Richard Harvey , was indicted for stealing 15 glass Salts , val . 10 s. a glass Candlestick , val . 1 s. a glass Crewit , val . 1 s. a glass Castor tipp 'd with Brass , val . 1 s. and several other Things , the Goods of John Betts , in his dwelling House , Dec. 19 , And , 7.

Thomas Friend , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing a silver Dish , val . 5 l. the Goods of the Rt . Hon . Benjamin Earl Fitzwalter , in his dwelling House , Dec. 26 . Henry Longmore . We lost a silver Dish from my Lord Fitzwalter 's in Pall-Mall , and we had some suspicion that the Prisoner had taken it away : upon which Mr. Jervis and I went down to Gravesend in pursuit of him ; and we found him on Board a Ship there , and brought the Dish away with us . This was on the Friday , and on the Monday following I went again to Gravesend , and apprehended the Prisoner . Morris Roberts . I am Cook to my Lord Fitzwalter ; on the 26th , of Dec. the Prisoner came to my Lord 's House to see a Relation of his who was employ 'd to Work there , and on the Monday following we miss 'd the Dish . We had very great Reason to suspect that he had taken it ; upon which Mr. Longmore and Mr. Jervis went to Gravesend after him , and when the Prisoner was brought to my Lord 's House , I ask 'd him how he could do such Things ? he reply 'd , he was very sorry , and wish 'd the Dish had been in the House an hundred Times after he had taken it out . He likewise own 'd that he himself scrap 'd the Coat of Arms out of the Dish , but denied that he cut it into Pieces . Pris . I did not take the Arms out of the Dish , nor cut it to Pieces ; one of my Shipmates did . John Jervis . On the first of this Month , at the Desire of my Lord Fitzwalter , I went down to Gravesend with Mr. Longmore , in Pursuit of the Prisoner . It seems he had told somebody that he belonged to the Defence , Capt . Coates , upon which we examined there , and could not find him ; but we were directed to go on board the Augustus , Capt . Townshend Accordingly I went on Board the Augustus , and told the Mate that I came to enquire for a Silver Dish that had been lost , therefore desir 'd to have the Prisoner 's Chest upon the Quarter-deck , that I might search for it ; but instead of that , the Mate brought up the Dish , cut into four Pieces as it is here . Q . Had you any Conversation with the Prisoner ? Jervis . On the Quarter-deck I asked him , how he could rob my Lord , where his Aunt lived , and he said , his Aunt at Knightsbridge gave him the Dish , and as I was going over the Gangway , I told him , if he could prove it was not my Lord 's Dish , he should have it again . I never had any Discourse with him afterwards , but left him on board the Ship , and the Butler and I brought the Dish to London . Wm Saunders . I was sent down to Gravesend with my Lord Fitzwalter 's Butler to fetch the Prisoner . He was brought ashore to us , and we put him into Gravesend Goal , and as we were putting on his Hand-cuffs , he cried , and wished the Dish was as safe in the House , as it was when he took it out Ann Morgan . One of the Silver Dishes stood upon the Dresser in my Lord 's House the same Night this was done , which was the 26th of December . The Prisoner took it by the Edge , gave it a little Turn , and said , the Pewter look 'd very well , but I did not see him take it away . Prisoner . I did not take the Dish off the Dresser ; I was coming up Stairs , and seeing it lye down , I happened to take it up . Guilty Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9.

Jan. 4 . Susannah Nichols . Last Monday was se'nnight , at a little after five in the Evening , I was coming from Newgate street towards the Poultry Compter , and just as I came to the Apothecary 's Door , the Prisoner came behind me , and held me fast down . I attempted to get from her into the Middle of the Highway , and some Fellows jostled me , and kept me close to her . Immediately I felt a Hand in my Pocket ; I ca n't say I could tell whose it was , but she stuck so close to me , that I ca n't think it was any but her 's Q . Did you lose any Thing ? Mrs. Nichols . Yes : I lost a green silk Purse , with a Steel Seal in it , and about 16 s. in Silver , and perceiving my Purse go , I cry 'd out Murder or three Times , and then the Prisoner loosed her Hold . Q . How long before that , can you take upon you to say , you had your Purse in your Pocket ? Mrs. Nichols . About a Quarter of an Hour before I came from Newgate street : I had just received ten Shillings and put it into my Purse . Pris . Q . How far did she walk that Night before this besel her ? Mrs. Nichols . From the Place that is called Blowbladder street , which is about a Quarter of a Mile I believe . Pris . Q . Might you not have had the Money taken privately from you before you met with me ? Mrs. Nichols No , I felt it go at this Time . Q . Are you sure the Prisoner is the Woman ? Mrs. Nichols . Yes , it was not quite dark , but very Moon-light , and there was not a shop shut up . Q . As the Prisoner was behind you , how could you take Notice of her Face ? Mrs. Nichols . With my struggling , I turn 'd about with my Face to her 's . William Offley . On the 4th , of January , about 6 in the Evening , I was going down the Poultry , and a little beyond the Compter I met the Prisoner and this Gentlewoman ( Mrs. Nichols ) as near together as it is possible for two Women to be , and both of them surrounded by a parcel of Men . I knowing Mrs. Nichols , and hearing her cry out Murder , I stepp 'd up to her , but before I could get up to her , the Prisoner had made her way through the other part of the Mob . I ca n't say that I saw her run , but I think she went off in the usual Manner . Q . Are you sure the Prisoner is the Woman that you saw so near Mrs. Nichols ? Offley . Yes , I am certain she is the Person . Q . Did she complain of being robbed at that Time ? Offley . Yes , about three Minutes after the Woman was gone , she stepped into the Entry at the Compter , and said she had been robb 'd . Pris . Q . You say there was a great Croud of People ; were not a great many as near to the Gentlewoman as I ? Offley . To the best of my Knowledge there was no Person so near Mrs. Nichols as the Prisoner . John Garnal . On Monday about the fourth of this Instant , about 6 o'Clock , I was coming from King Street , Cheapside , and when I came within a few Yards of the Poultry , I saw six or seven Men hauling the Gentlewoman , and pushing her to and fro ' . She cryed out , but I ca n't be certain what the Words were : I believe it was Murder , but I ca n't be certain . It being pretty near the Compter Passage ; I apprehended they were taking her into the Compter , upon which I went up to them , and just as I came even with them , they all separated and left the Gentlewoman to herself . I then observed her clap her Hand to her Side , and thought I heard her say , her Watch ! her Watch ! Then the Prisoner crossed the Way on the other Side of the Poultry . She went an exceeding Pace , sometimes walked , and sometimes ran , so that I could not keep Pace with her without sometimes running myself , and upon her coming from them , and making such Haste , I believed her to be a Person concerned . When she came to the Corner of Walbrook , she turned down , and I believe might be a dozen Yards before me . I followed her to see where she went , and when I turn 'd the Corner , I saw her take off her Cloak , and put it under her Arm , and run with full Speed . I then thought she certainly had the Watch about her , upon which I ran and grasp 'd hold of her , and told her , she had stolen a Watch . It was just by the Poulterer 's Shop that I first seized her , and a Man came out of the Shop to my Assistance , and took hold of her likewise . Immediately I heard two Blows behind me , and the Person that had got hold of the Prisoner 's Arm reel 'd a little on one Side . Soon afterwards I received a Blow myself on the Side of my Head , and turning about to see from whence it came , the Prisoner sprang out of my Arms . I pursued her , crying out Stop Thief ! up Buckler 's Bury , I overtook her again , and stopped her a second Time , and call 'd for Assistance . Upon which , I heard the Person that followed her , strike about very smartly with his Stick , and I desired the Person , at whose Door I seized her , to let me bring her in , but he held the Door against me . I then took her into the House of one Mr. Bingham , a Silk-Dyer , and told her , she had stole a Watch , upon which , she was very willing to be searched , and turned a Purse and other Things out of her Pocket . She pretended that she was entirely innocent of the Matter , and that she was going to the Bottom of Walbrook to see a Friend who was going out of Town . After we had staid some Time at Mr. Bingham 's , the Person was brought in that follow 'd us , striking those that endeavoured to take the Prisoner , and we carried them both to the Watch-house , where the Man pull 'd out a Purse and shook some Silver out of it into his Hand . They were been carried next Day before the Alderman at Guildhall , and ordered to be search 'd ; and the Woman then produc 'd a green Purse , and the Man a light blue one , which I can take my Oath was not the same that he pull 'd out at the Watch-house George Lesley . I was not present when the Fact was committed , but I was going from Walbrook towards Cheapside , and by the Poulterer 's Shop , facing the Mantron-house , I saw this Man ( Garnal ) holding that Woman at the Bar . He said , she had stole a Watch , and desired me to assist him . I was at a Loss whether I should stop or go past , and just as I came up to them , a Man rush 'd from Cheapside , and struck me over the Head . I asked him , why he struck me ? and he said , she was his Wife , and he knew she was innocent . While he was repeating these Words , he redoubled his Blows , and struck me again , and likewise the Man that had hold of the Prisoner . She then ran with the Man that struck us , up Buckler 's Bury , and so we pursued them , crying Stop Thief ! The other People ran faster than I , so that I was a little distanc 'd , and saw no more of them 'till I came to the upper End of Buckler's-Bury , and perceiving the Man using his Stick as smartly as before , I seized him ; the Woman was taken by somebody else at the same Time , and when they came together they denied that they had ever seen each other before . Q . How near was the Prisoner to that Man when they ran off together ? Lesley . They were so near that I ca n't fix any Distance . Q . Did they seem to be acquainted with each other ? Lesley . The man told me she was his Wife , and he knew her to be innocent . Q . Was the Prisoner in hearing then ? Lesley . She was near enough to hear , and did not contradict it ; but whether her struggling with this Man might not prevent her hearing it , I ca n't say . William Lambkin . On Monday the fourth of this Instant , I was standing at my Door in Buckler's-Bury , and heard a Cry of stop Thief ; and seeing the Prisoner run very fast up the Street , I took hold of her . She struggled with me very much , and in the mean Time James Robinson ran after her and struck me . In order to avoid the Blow , I let go the Prisoner , and pursued her again , and had not run above forty Yards , before she was taken by Garnal . Defence . I was going to a Master of a Ship at Wapping , and hearing them cry Stop Thief ! I ran to hear the Noise , as you know Country People generally do . I had my Clock over my Arm , and this Man stopp 'd me , and said , the Lady had lost her Watch . He got me into a House , and I was searched , and I had neither Gold nor Money , but half a Guinea and a Shilling in my Pocket . Mary Ann Smith . Last Monday was seven-night , a little before Night , the Prisoner call 'd at my House , and said , she was going down to Wapping , to enquire after some Country People , and desired me to go with her . She hurt her Foot going along , and we went Arm in Arm down the City ; and just by the Poultry-Compter , ( I think they call it ) a Croud of People came by , and shov 'd me down , and so we parted . C. Did you hear any Out-cry in the Street then ? Smith . No , but there was a whole Heap of People came along and parted us , and tumbled me down . C. When you fell down , what Distance was the Prisoner from you ? Smith . I ca n't tell ; she was shov 'd away from me as I suppose . C. Why did not you ask for your Companion when you got up ? Smith . Who should I ask among Strangers ? I turn 'd about to look for her , but could not see her . C Were you at any Time near the Poultry-Compter Door ? Smith I think this was against the Church . C. Was there nothing said of the Loss of a Watch in your hearing ? Smith . No , nothing at all . Q . Where did you go when you got up ? Smith . I was going to my Mother 's in East-Smithfield , and the Prisoner having some Business at Wapping , I was to go Part of the Way with her . I live in Shoe lane ; my Husband is a Journeyman Brasier , and I have known the Prisoner about half a Year . Ann Howard . The Prisoner was a Chair-woman to me . I have known her about seven or eight Months . She has been in my House a Week together , and I always took her to be an honest pains-taking Woman . Margaret Downs . I have known her 16 or 17 Years ; she was a Servant to one John Stevenson , upon Newcastle-Bridge . I recommended her to my Brother , and I should not have sent her there , if I had not heard that she bore a good Character . John Swinton . The Prisoner lodged at my House about 9 Months , and was recommended to me by the last Witness . I have entrusted her with every Thing in the House , and never knew her addicted to pilfering . The Night she was apprehended , she went from my House with a Design to go to Wapping to see a Relation that was going to Newcastle upon Tyne ; and I take her to be as honest a Woman as any in the Parish . Q . Where do you live ? Swinton . At the Whittington and his Cat in Bloomsbury Market . Frances Gammon . I have known the Prisoner ever since the beginning of last Summer : She used to come down to my House in Wapping to enquire after Masters of Ships in Newcastle , who very often us 'd to bring her little Presents . About a Fortnight ago , the 3d Day of this Month , was my Child 's Birth-Day , who was three Years-old , and the next Day this young Woman ( Smith ) came to my House to wait for the Prisoner . Littleton Westley . I have known her between 7 and 8 Months . I have employed her to wash for my Family , and never knew but that she bore a very good Character . Guilty Death . 13.

John Simmonds . On the 23d of Dec. in the Evening , I was spending the Evening at a public House , and my Daughter came to me , and Inform 'd me I had been robb 'd . I went Home directly and missed the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment . The next Day I went to Goldsmith's-Hall , and advertised my Goods , and the Day following one of the Gold Rings was brought to my House , but I ca n't tell by whom , because I did not see the Person that came with it . Catherine Simmonds . I am Daughter to the last Witness . On the 23d of Dec . I went to the Prisoner 's House , and while Lumley and I were at Dinner , the other Prisoner came in . When we had din 'd we went to our House , and when I had put on a clean Apron , we went out to go as far as the Fleet : there were the two Prisoners , my Sister , and I together , and when the Man ( Burgess ) came as far as St. Andrew 's Church in Holborn , he swore he would go no farther . She ( Lumley ) would have gone on with us , but he made her go back with him , and so I and my Sister parted from them . We went then as far as the Fleet , and as we came along from thence , we called at another Place , so that it was near six o'Clock when we got Home . Q . In what Condition did you find the House then ? Simmonds . We found the Street Door and the Parlour Window both open , and we directly missed all the Goods that are in the Indictment . My Father advertised them on the Thursday , and on the Friday , which was Christmas-Day , this Gold Ring was brought to our House by Mr . Manners , a Goldsmith in the Strand . After this I went to the Swan Tavern the Corner of Newport Market , where I receiv 'd Instructions from several of our Relations , how I should go to find the Prisoners . Accordingly the Goldsmith 's Maid and I went to the Prisoner 's Lodging , and took them both out of Bed , and carry 'd them to the Tavern . We then went before the Justice , and there the Woman confessed she had the Things , and where they were , but the Man denied that he knew any Thing of the Matter . She own 'd that she had the Things , and that they were at her Lodging in May-Fair , and said that he ( Burgess ) had the Key in his Pocket , and that he had baited her to do it . Burgess afterwards took the Key out of his Pocket himself , and deliver 'd it to her , and we open 'd the Room Door with it , and found all the Things that are in this Sack . She likewise told us , that the Gown and Petticoat , and the Ring with 6 Diamonds , were in pawn in Marlborough-Meuse , and she went with us to the Pawnbroker 's , and we found them accordingly . At another of the Prisoner 's Lodgings in Newport Market we found my Garnet Ear Rings , a Diamond Ring , and a Cypher Ring , and the Woman own 'd they were mine . Pris . Burgess . Did I give the Key to my Wife ( Lumley ) or to the Constable ? Simmonds . He first denied that he had the Key , but he afterwards took it out of his Pocket and gave it to his Wife . John Simmonds , jun . I went with my Uncle and Cousin to Mr . Manner 's , and they describing the Woman Prisoner , we agreed that Mr . Manners 's Girl and my Sister should go to their Room . Accordingly they did , and Manners 's Servant knowing her to be the Person that had been at their Shop , the Prisoners were both brought to the Tavern . From thence we carried them before Justice Fraser , and we went into the Entry with the Woman Prisoner , where she confessed that she pick 'd open the Locks of the Drawers with a Knife , and took the Things away in a Sheet : that she carried them into Russel-street , and ty 'd them up , and then gave a Man 3 d to carry them into Hanover Yard , where her Husband was waiting for her , and that he ( Burgess ) carry 'd them to May-Fair . When the Justice had examin 'd the Prisoners , we took Burgess to the Round-house till next Morning , and when we left him there , Lumley desired him to give her the Key of the Room : he at first denied that he had it , but afterwards gave it to her , and then she told me , if I would go with her she would shew us where the Things were . Upon this we took a couple of Coaches , and went to May-Fair , and open 'd the Room Door , and found all the Things that are in this Sack , after which she herself pull 'd a Tile out of the Hearth , and took out 2 Gold Rings , a pair of Ear Bobs , and a pair of Gold Buttons . We afterwards carried her to the Gatehouse , where she told us she had pawn 'd the Petticoat , Gown , and Diamond Rings at Marlborough-Meuse , and a pair of Sheets in West street , and we found them accordingly . Ralph Warner , Constable . On Christmas Day at Night , I was sent for to the Swan Tavern , and charg 'd with the 2 Prisoners . I took them before Justice Fraser , who examin 'd them , but they both denied the Fact . After they had been there some Time , the Woman Prisoner went into the Passage with this Gentleman , that Gentlewoman and myself , and she own 'd to us that she had taken the Things and wrapp 'd them up in a Sheet , and going along , she dropp 'd the Cup or the Mug , and kick 'd it before her , and pick 'd it up again : that when she came into Russel-street , she ty 'd the Things up tight , and gave a Man 3 d. to carry them to Hanover-Yard . Upon this I told the Justice if he discharg 'd the Man Prisoner , he would go and secure the Goods ; but the Justice refusing to detain him , I order 'd him to aid and assist me . He refused , upon which I again insisted on his being confin 'd , and then he was sent to St. Ann 's Round-house . When we came there , the Woman said to him , Burgess ! you have got the Key of the Room ! No , ( said he ) I have it not : Why ( said I ) when I search 'd you just now , you had it in your Pocket . He then deliver 'd the Key to her , and that very Key unlock 'd the Door in May Fair where these Goods were . After this , Lumley went with us to Mr. Young 's a Pawnbroker in Marlborough-Meuse , where the Gown , Petticoat , and Rings were pawn 'd ; and the Sheets we found by her Direction pawn 'd at a Neighbours . When we came to the Gatehouse , she told me she had sold some Things to Mr . Manners 's , upon which I went there , and found some Silver Tea Spoons , and Part of a large Spoon broken , and one that the Silversmith said he had melted down . It was near 11 o'Clock that Night before we got her to the Gatehouse , and this Gentleman , ( Simmonds , jun . ) and I went with her to her Room in Newport-Market , to fetch her Pockets and other Things , that she was to take with her to Prison . We asked her if there was any Things concealed there , and at first she said there was not , but afterwards she said she had often heard her Husband talk of hiding Things under the Bricks and Tiles , and she went directly to the Hearth , and took up a Tile , and found 2 Rings and these Buttons . Pris . Burgess . Did I deny the Key when she asked me for it ? Warner . He did deny that he had it . Elizabeth Robertson . I am Servant to Mrs . Manners ; and all that I have to say is , that Lumley is the Person that brought the Ring to my Mistress . Emery Needham . About 3 Weeks before this Thing happen 'd , Burgess and his Wife took a Lodging of me in May-Fair . On the 23d of Dec . I saw them both go up Stairs . Burgess had a Bundle upon his Back , and I gave his Wife a Candle to light him up , and when he came down again he had no Bundle at all , only the Candle in his Hand , and the Key of the Room upon his Finger . Elizabeth Young . On the 23d of Dec. the Woman Prisoner brought a Gown , a Petticoat , and a Ring to me and desir 'd to have Money upon them . I ask 'd her if they were her own ? she told me they were , upon which I lent her 1 l. 15 s. upon them . She did not come in her own Name , but in the Name of Mary Elderson , and I am sure she is the Person . Pris . Burgess . Did you ask me if they were my own ? Young . Yes , I did . Thomas Painter . I happen 'd to be in the Neighbourhood where my Brother Simmonds lives , and being inform 'd he had been robb 'd , I went to him , and we agreed to draw up an Advertisement , and go to Goldsmith 's Hall . On Christmas-Day this Ring was produc 'd , upon which we went to Mrs . Manners and were told by her Maid that she should know the Woman Prisoner again . Upon this we agreed , that as my Neice was pretty well acquainted with the Prisoner , she and Manners 's Maid should go together to see if she knew her . When they came there , she said she would swear to her , and then we went up Stairs , and took them out of Bed , and carry 'd them before the Justice , where the Woman Prisoner confessed the Robbery in the same manner as has been told before . We took the Man to St. Ann 's Round-house , and just as we were going away , his Wife ( Lumley ) said , Burgess ! you have got the Key ! and he said , I have it not : but the Constable telling him that he had got it in his Side Pocket , he gave the Key directly to his Wife . After we had secured him , we took a couple of Coaches and went away , and found all the Things that are in this Sack . Thomas Painter , jun . was present when the Prisoners were apprehended , and heard some Part of Lumley 's Confession before the Justice . He confirm 'd the above Depositions , so far as they related to the Goods found at the Prisoner 's Lodgings in May-Fair . Lumley 's Defence . This Man ( Burgess ) is innocent of the Matter . My two Cousins din 'd at our House that Day the Robbery was committed , and when he came Home he was drunk . We were going to the Fleet to see Mr. Jones , and he came along with us as far as St. Andrew 's Church , and then he would go no farther , but took hold of me , and said I should go back with him into Newport-Market . Accordingly I did , and he laid down on the Bed for a Quarter of an Hour , and then went out . My Cousin charg 'd me that very Night to come to their House , and when I came there , the Street Door was open , and in I went , and took these Things . I hired a Man in Plumbtree-Court to carry them to May-Fair , and was to give him 6 d. for his Trouble ; and in May Fair I found this Man ( Burgess ) and he carry 'd them Home for me , and I concealed several of the Things under my own Cloaths because he should not see them . William Smith , John Milson , William Burgess , Thomas Pringley , Jonathan Freer , and Benjamin Story , gave Burgess the Character of an honest Man . John Barber , Gerard Bowyer , Michael Capgny , George Wright , Thomas Randal , William Farrit , and William Armstrong , had known Lumley different Numbers of Years , and never heard but that she was an honest Woman . The Jury found both the Prisoners Guilty , and earnestly desired that Lumley might be recommended to his Majesty as an Object of Mercy . [ Lumley : Death .

Joseph Pig of Harmonsworth , was indicted for stealing 2 Weather Sheep , value 30 s. the Property of Isaac Singer , Jan. 9 . George Kent . I was present when the Skins of two of my Master 's Sheep were found in the Prisoner 's House . I knew they were his Skins , because they were marked with R S. and that is what he always marks his Sheep with . We secur 'd the Prisoner and one Chance , and carry 'd them before Sir Thomas Reynell , but I ca n't say that he either own 'd or denied it in my Hearing . Isaac Singer . I lost two Weather Sheep last Friday was se'nnight at Night , and my Shepherd informing me that he suspected Joseph Pig to be concerned in stealing them , I got a Warrant , and search 'd the Widow Souch 's House . The Prisoner was there when we first went in , but before we had finish 'd our Search he went off . We follow 'd him , and he just put a Bottle of Beer into his own House , and ran off as fast as he could We went into the House , and in the Closet we found some Tallow : After that we went up Stairs , and look 'd about a little in the Bed-chamber ; and in the Chimney there was something cover 'd up with Sort of a Rug , which I pull 'd away and then saw my two Sheep-skins lie there ; they were mark 'd with R. S. on the Hind Leg . Under the Skins I saw the Guts , and afterwards I found the Carcase of one of my Sheep wrapp 'd up in a Cloth , and another cut into Quarters . The next Day which was Sunday , I got 5 or 6 Men to assist me , and we went in Pursuit of the Prisoners . We had not got above 3 Miles from his House before we met him , and after we had secured him , we went to a bad House , to see for Jeremiah Chance , and took him likewise , we then deliver 'd them into the Custody of a Constable , and next Morning they were carried before Sir . Tho Reywell who committed one to Newgate , and the other to New Prison . Pris . Was I at Home when you came to my House ? Singer . You was at the Anchor at first , and I saw you run away from thence . James Tillier . I am Shepherd to Mr. Singer , and about half an Hour after Four in the Afternoon , I saw the Prisoner , Chance and another go by my Fold , and the next Morning I miss 'd two Sheep . I inform 'd my Master I suspected the Prisoner , and he told me he would have a Warrant to search , but I was not present when they went to Pig 's House . Q . How came you to suspect that Pig had any Intention to steal your Sheep ? Tillier . Because he was a Man that had but a very baddish Character . Jeremiah Chance . The Prisoner and one Carpenter ask 'd me to go out with them , and when we came a little way , they told me they were going to break open a wholesale Shop at Harlingston ; but meeting Pig 's Mother by the way , we were forc 'd to seperate , and he went Home with her . About ten the same Night we went from Pig 's House with a Sack in order to break open this Shop ; but being disappointed in that and some other Designs , we were not willing to go Home without something , and at last we agreed to have a couple of Sheep out of a Fold that we had gone past that Afternoon . Pig caught one and put it into the Sack , and I caught another and tied the Legs of it , and then we carried them both to Mr . Pig 's House . The next Morning we stead the Sheep , and then I sent him out for some Bread and Beer , and when he came back again , he told his Wife some Men were coming to search ; upon which I put the Sheep into a little Closet ; the Guts and the Skins I put into the Chimney , and cover 'd them with a Rug , after which I walk 'd out pretty leisurely , 'till I got some distance from the House , and then I began to run . I had not gone far before I met with Pig , and we agreed to cross the Thames , and make our Escape to East-Ham : Accordingly we went to one Will . Clement 's at Shugg's-Hill , and after we had been there some time the Prisoner was taken . The Prisoner having nothing to offer in his Defence , the Jury found him Guilty , Death . 20.

Thomas Colt . Last Monday was sevennight , at almost Twelve at Night , I met the Prisoner in Long-lane . He was asking Charity , and begg 'd for God 's Sake that I would relieve him . I told him it was not in my Power to relieve him , but I was going to the Red-lion in Aldersgate street , and if he would accept of Part of a Tankard of Beer , he should be welcome . We went into the Golden-horse Alehouse , and called for Beer , and when we were coming out , I told him , I was as destitute of a Lodging as he ; upon which he said , he could help me to one . He then took me up Barbican into Golden-Lane , and then into Hartshorn-Court , where he said , he had got a Sw eetheart , and he would make her get up , and I should go to Bed . I did not like the Looks of the House , therefore would not go in ; and he then shewed me another Place , where there was a Light ; but I did not care to go in there neither , and so I determined to go to my own Lodging ; and just as I came back to the House where he would have had me gone in first , he knock 'd me down ; I ca n't tell whether it was with his Fist or a Weapon , but my Face was very black . When he had got me down , he took off my Hat and Wig , and a Guinea in Gold , 4 s. in Silver , and a silk Hankerchief out of my Pocket . As soon as I recovered myself , I ran down some Alleys and call 'd Watch ! and I told the Watchman I had been robb 'd , and that I believed the Prisoner was gone down some of those Alleys , but not being able to find him , I went to the Watch-house , and shewed the Beadle the Place where I was robb 'd . I afterwards went with one of the Watchmen to the Golden Horse to see if they knew the Prisoner , but they denied that they knew any Thing of him , upon which I went back to the Watch-house , and after I had got a Handkerchief to tie about my Head , I went Home . The next Morning about ten o'Clock , the Watchmen came to my Lodging , and inform 'd me they had found a Wig , and when I saw it , I knew it to be mine . They said , they would go to a Place where they suspected the Prisoner was , and would help me to the sight of him . Accordingly they went into a House , and I follow 'd them , but the Place was so dark , that I came out again ; and one of the Watchmen told me , the Person whom they suspected was there , and he was going to a Cook 's Shop , and if I would set down on the Bench , I might have a full View of him . Presently he came out , and as soon as I saw his Face , I knew him to be the Man that robbed me . We went back to the Watch-house , and three Men were dispatch 'd to take him , and when he was brought into the Room , he immediately came up to me , fell on his Knees , and desired me not to prosecute him , for so sure as I did , he should be hang 'd ; and this he repeated several Times . Pris . Is he sure I am the Man ? Colt . Yes , I am certain of it . Pris . Where did you light on me first ? Colt . In Long-Lane . Pris . Where did you carry me to ? Colt . To the Golden-Horse . Pris . What did you give me there ? Colt . Some Drink . Pris . Who was in Company ? Colt . A great many Hackney Coachmen and some other People . C. Was it light enough for you to see the Prisoner 's Face ? Colt . Yes . C. Was you Sober ? Colt . Yes , as sober as I am now . John Austen . I am a Watchman in the Liberty of Golden-Lane . Last Tuesday Morning at Two o'Clock , I was beating my Rounds in Hartshorn-Court , and heard a Man call Watch ! Just by the Pump I saw the Prosecutor ; he had a Blow on the Right Side of his Face , and he told me he had been knock 'd down and robb 'd . I bid him come along with me and I 'd see if I could find the Prisoner . We went down some Alleys to no Purpose and then the Prosecutor went to the Watch-house , and we parted . When the Prisoner was taken and brought to the Watch-house , he fell on his Knees once or twice , and begg 'd of the Prosecutor not to send him to Goal , for if he did , he was sure to be hang 'd . He likewise did the same when he was before Justice Poulson . Charles Hunt . About 2 o'Clock last Tuesday Morning , this Thomas Colt came down to the Watch-house , and desir 'd to come in . I was standing at the Door , and seeing him without either Hat or Wig , imagin 'd he had been in a Quarrel , therefore refus 'd to let him come in . The Beadle order 'd him in , and he then describ 'd the Person that had robb 'd him , and the Place where he was carry 'd to . I told him I would shew him the Person in the Morning , and accordingly I went into a Gin-shop in Hartshorn-Court by myself , and called for a Quartern , and I immediately saw the Person whom I suspected : That was this Man , Christopher Jordan . I told Colt that the Prisoner was coming out , and as soon as he saw him , he said , that is the very Man that robb 'd me , but he has not got the same Cloaths on . We went down to the Watch-House , and told the Beadle of this , upon which he desired the Prosecutor not to take the Man up if he was not sure he was the Person , but he still insisted that he was the Man , and he should know him from ten Thousand . We then went , and apprehended him , and brought him to the Watch-House , and he directly went up to the Prosecutor , and said , for God 's Sake do n't prosecute me , for I shall be hang 'd . Henry Thompson . I went with Charles Hunt to take this Man out of the Ginshop , and when we brought him to the Watch-house , he fell on his Knees before the Prosecutor , and said if he was sent to Goal , he should certainly be hang 'd . William Whistler . I went into the Watch-house at Dinner time with a Pint of Beer according to Custom , and the Prosecutor desir 'd me to go with the Watchmen to take Christopher Jordan , and with some Persuasions I consented . Hunt went in first , and Thompson and I follow 'd , and we brought the Prisoner to the Watch-house . As soon as came in , he went up to the Prosecutor who sat facing the Door ; and the Beadle asked him whether he knew the Prisoner ? He reply 'd he did , and that he was the Man that robb 'd him : The Prisoner then said , for God 's Sake , do n't send me to Newgate ; do n't swear against me , for if you do , so sure shall I be hang 'd ; and this he repeated three or four Times . - Dyer I was charged to assist the Constable , and when the Prisoner was before Justice Poulson , he fell on his Knees and desired Colt not to prosecute him , for it he swore against him , he should be hang 'd , Defence . I have 2 or 3 Coachmen here that were in the Box drinking with the Prosecutor . George Hodges . I live next Door to the Prisoner : Last Monday was 7-night , at Night , my Mistress desired the Prisoner to let me lie with him , and as I was going to Bed the Prisoner desired me to stay and sup with him ; accordingly I did , and before twelve o'Clock , the Prisoner and all of us were a-bed . Q . How do you remember that Day ? Hodges . Because the Prisoner was taken up next Morning . Q . What Business do you follow ? Hodges . I am a Frame Maker by Trade , but now Business is dead , I run on Errands . Q . What House is this in Hartshorn-Court ? Hodges . It is a sort of a Brandy-shop kept by one Mrs. Bagley . Timothy Beversley . I have nothing to say on Account of the Prisoner , only this , that he is not the Person that came into the Golden Horse Alehouse with the Prosecutor , last Monday 7-night at Night . Q . How do you know that ? Beversley . Because I let them in , and took particular Notice of them . Q . What Time of Night was the Prosecutor there ? Beversley . He came in about Twelve , and staid a Quarter of an Hour . Q . How came you to be there at that Time of Night . Beversley . I assisted the People of the House , because it was Club Night , and the Gentleman of the House was angry , because I let Strangers in . Q . How can you take on you to say the Prisoner is not the Man , that came in with the Prosecutor . Beversley . Because when I went on Saturday to see the Prisoner I found him quite otherwise ; the other Man was a little short siz 'd Man , of a dark Complection , and pretty much pock-broken . George Harrison . I live in the lower Room under the Prisoner : There was a Sort of a Bit of a Supper that Night , and the Prisoner went up to Bed between Twelve and One , and the Door was bolted . I sat by the Fire-side when the Scuffle of the Robbery was done , and I heard some-body cry , Aye Boy ! I ca n't tell who it was ; presently one ran up the Alley , and then the Watchman came almost Two . I heard a Man call Watch ! and the Watchman cryed , Aye Boy ! What 's the matter now ? My Wife went out at Three o'Clock to visit a Woman who was dying ; and I went down and bolted the Door after her and no-body went out afterwards . Thomas Bradford . This Man at the Bar is not the Person that came into the Golden Horse with the Man that was robb 'd ; I know it very well because I was there when they came in at 12 o'Clock . Q . How came you to be there ? Bradford . I am a Coachman and live in the Neighbourhood . Q . What sort of a Man was the Person that you say came in with the Prosecutor ? Bradford . A thin , squat Man , fresh-colour 'd in his Face , with a brownish Coat on . Q . Did you drink with them ? Bradford . No , but I was in the Box fronting them , and they had a pint of Two-penny Purl . Thomas Woodcrost . I was at Dinner at the Black-Horse in Golden-Lane at the same Time that the Prisoner was taken up . The Prosecutor said the Prisoner had pick 'd him up in Long-Lane , and took him to the Golden Horse in Aldersgate street and treated him with a Pint of Two-penny Purl , after which he knock 'd him down and robb 'd him under Pretence of getting him a Lodging : I hearing this went to the House , and asked them what Sort of a Man was there last Night : They told me he was a swarthy Man , thin visag 'd , and with brown Cloaths on . I desired them to go down to New-Prison to see the Prisoner , and Mr. Bradford and some others went , and said he was not the Man . John Gearing . I have known the Prisoner about 16 Years : We work 'd together as Wheel-boys in the Gold and Silver Way , I never heard but that he was an honest Fellow . Elizabeth Morson . I have known him from a Child , and liv 'd in the House with him 10 Years . He used to go on Errands , and cry Fish about the Streets , and I never knew him guilty of an ill Thing ; but I have not seen him much these 6 Years . Elizabeth Harding .

It was observ 'd by the Councel for the Prosecution , that the Indictment set forth , that before the issuing of the Commission of Bankrupt , the Defendant was a Brasier , and got his Living by buying and selling in that Trade , and was indebted to one Jean Brifort , the Sum of one hundred Pounds and upwards , for Goods sold and delivered : That after the Defendant was so indebted , he became a Bankrupt in the true Intent and Meaning of the Statute ; and upon the Petition of the said Jean Brifort , on the 15th of Nov. in the 14th Year of his Majesty 's Reign , a Commission of Bankrupt issued out , directed to Roger Coningsby , Esq ; and others ; and that it directed that they should proceed to put that Commission in Execution . Accordingly they ( having taken the Oaths according to the Statute ) declar 'd the Defendant a Bankrupt , within the true Intent and Meaning of the Act . That on the 18th of Nov. they caused a public Notice to be published in the London Gazette , whereby the Defendant was required to surrender himself on the 24th of Nov. ( then ] Instant , and on the first and thirtieth of Dec. following : That accordingly he did surrender himself , and submitted to be examin 'd on Oath ; and that in the Course of the Proceedings in Order to make a Discovery , the Defendant took his Corporal Oath on the 17th of February , 1740 : that at this Time a Paper Writing mark 'd with the Letter D , and three Books mark 'd with the Letters A , B , and C , and 2 other Papers mark 'd with the Letters E and F , were shewn to him , and he swore as follows ; that the Paper Writing mark 'd D ; that the several Books mark 'd A , B , and C , and the Paper Writings mark 'd E and F , did contain a full Disclosure of all his Effects , and upon what Consideration he had disposed of any of his Goods , Merchandise , or other Effects , and all Books and Writings relating thereto , or in which he was any W interested ; or whereby he might have any Profit ; except only such Part of his Effects as had been before disposed of ; and such Sums of Money as had been laid out in Expences ; and that he likewise swore , that at the Time of his Examination he delivered up to the major Part of the Commissioners all Books , Papers , and Writings relating thereto as were in his Custody or Power , his necessary wearing Apparel excepted ; and that he had not removed , concealed or embezzled any Part of his Effects with Intent to defraud his Creditors : Whereas in Truth and in Fact , the Defendant had concealed one Copper with the Iron-work thereto belonging , not mention 'd in any of the Paper Writings ; and whereas in Truth and in Fact he had concealed 2 Stove Grates , no Account of which was mentioned , & c. and whereas he had concealed a Shop Book of Accompts belonging to his Shop in Moorfields , and which was not contained in any of the Books or Papers mark 'd as above ; and whereas he had conceal 'd 6 dozen Flower Boxes of the Value of 10 l. odd Money , no Account of which was mentioned in any of the Books , & c. & c. It was farther urg 'd by the Councel on the same Side , that although the Articles with which the Defendant stood charg 'd might seem to be but inconsiderable , yet that where some Things were conceal 'd , there was great Reason to apprehend that others had been conceal 'd ; and that a Man who would be guilty of Perjury in one Instance would in others : That it appeared from the Face of the Indictment that the Prisoner stood charg 'd with 4 Instances of Perjury ; and that if one of them should be prov 'd , that would be sufficient to convict the Defendant . That although he had taken a general Oath to reveal all his Effects according to Act of Parliament , yet notwithstanding that he was actually possess 'd of a Copper of which he made no mention at all in his Account deliver 'd to the Commissioners ; likewise 2 Stove Grates , and a Shop Book , which would appear to be very material ; and besides these he had conceal 'd a large quantity of Brasiery Goods : That Crimes of this Sort ought not to be aggravated , being exceeding heinous in their own Nature , for if People would take those Libertien to forswear themselves , there would be an End of Justice , and there could be no Security of Men 's Lives or Properties , & c.

Charles Corner , of St. Catherines , was indicted , for that he , after the 24th of June , 1736 , feloniously forged , & c a certain Paper Writing , partly printed , and partly written , with the counterfeit Mark of Stephen Huggins , purporting to be a Bill of Sale , which said Bill of Sale is in these Words following , viz. `` To all to whom these Presents shall come , I `` Stephen Huggins , Mariner , late belonging to `` his Majesty 's Ship Prince Frederick , send Greeting. `` Know ye , that I Stephen Huggins , for , `` and in Consideration of the Sum of 24 Pounds , `` to me in Hand paid , at , and before the ensealing `` and delivery hereof , by Anthony Underwood , `` of the Precinct of St. Catherines , Victualler , `` do hereby acknowledge myself to be therewith `` fully paid and satisfy 'd ; and do by these Presents `` alien and assign to the said Anthony Underwood , `` a Ticket for my Service done , and performed `` on board his Majesty 's Ship the Prince `` Frederick , and Number on the Books 1572 , amounting `` to the Sum of 24 Pounds , & c. & c. `` Witness my Hand and Seal , the 26th Day of `` Nov. & c. and in the 15th Year of the Reign `` of our Sovereign Lord George , of Great-Britain. `` & c. & c. `` The Mark of + `` Stephen Huggins `` With Intent to defraud our Sovereign Lord the King , & c.

On the 26th of Nov. last , the Prisoner came to me in the Name of Stephen Huggins , to dispose of a Man of War 's Ticket . I agreed to give him 17 l. for it , and a Writing was executed , and he then said his Name was Stephen Huggins , and made his Mark . I asked him if he could not write ? and he said No . I went with him to the Ship and Horseshoe , and to the Sugar Loaf and Punch Bowl , and afterwards went Home and gave him the Money . When this was done , the Prisoner seem 'd to be uneasy , and went away ; and I clapp 'd the Ticket upon the Table , and then I found I had paid him 10 l. too much . I then went to several Places in Pursuit of the Prisoner , and sometime afterwards with much Difficulty I met with him , and carry 'd him before Justice Jones , before whom he acknowledged that his Name was Charles Connor . This is the Ticket ; it is such as Commanders of Ships give Seamen , and is what we call the King 's Bond . The Prisoner offered it to me , and I saw him set his Mark to the Bill of Sale by the Name of Stephen Huggins . Pris . Q . How much did you insist upon as a Premium for this Money ? Underwood . Four Shillings and Sixpence in the Pound . Pris . Q . Did not you insist upon 6 s ? Underwood . No , I paid him 10 l. odd Money too much , and the Ship is quite new , and will not be at Home these 3 Years . John Gray . I was a subscribing Witness to this Bill of Sale , and I saw the Prisoner make this Mark in the Name of Stephen Huggins . He said the Ticket was his own , and he had earned it himself . Q to Underwood . Did you receive the Ticket at the same Time that he executed this ? Underwood . Yes . The Bill of Sale was read . John Jervis . I saw Mr. Underwood pay the Prisoner 17 l. for the Ticket , and I heard him say his Name was Stephen Huggins . Counc . Did he sign the Bill of Sale , or make his Mark ? Jervis He made his Mark , and said he could neither write or read , The Ticket was read . Prisoner . I belong to the Marlborough India Man , Capt . Smith On the last Fast Day , about 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon , as near as I can guess , I was coming from the Ship , and by Wellclose-Square , I found five Farthings , a Form of Prayer , that Ticket and a Knife with a Seal at the Handle . I asked a Carman what it was , and he told me it was a Ticket ; whereof I kept it till Thursday , and then it not being advertised , I carry 'd it to Mr. Underwood He was the Person that filled up the Bill of Sale , and bid me make my Mark ; and Doctor Gray ( as they call him ) was concern 'd in purchasing the Ticket . Thomas Bolton I have known the Prisoner 5 or 6 Years . Last First Day about half an Hour past 2 o'Clock , I met him in Gravel Lane , and he said he had found a Ticket , a clasp Knife , a Form of Prayer , and five Farthings in Money . He shewed me the Ticket , and it appear 'd to be wet and dirty , and he told me he picked it up in Wellclose-Square . Sarah Surkey . I have known him this 20 Years ; he was born of honest Parents , and it is to my very great Grief that I see him in this Place ; but I have not known any Thing of him for these 8 or 10 Months Esther Squires .

I have known the Prisoner since last March , and never heard a bad Character of him . Ann Whittingham . I am his Sister in Law , and his general Character is , that he always was an honest Man in all Cases that lay in his Power . John Pulley . I have known him from a Child : I ca n't say much to his general Character one Way or other , for he has been out of our Neighbourhood some Time , but I never knew no Ill of him . Justice Jones . This is the Ticket that was produced before me when I committed the Prisoner , and I look upon it to be as good a Ticket as ever was made , for I have seen a great many of these Things , and have receiv 'd a great deal of Money on them . There not being proper Evidence to prove the Ticket to be a real Ticket , the Prisoner was acquitted . 43. Ann Peck alias Hodges , was indicted with the above Charles Connor , for stealing a Woollen Waistcoat , a Serge Waistcoat , a Linnen Handkerchief , a Tin Box , and 10 s. in Money , the Goods and Money of Stephen Huggins , Nov. 26 Both acquitted . 44. George Lavan , was indicted for stealing 20 Guineas , the Money of James Hambleton , Esq ; Dec. 24 Mr. Hambleton . Within these 2 Months I have several Times missed Money out of my Pockets while I have been abed , and never could detect the Person that robb 'd me , and therefore I was resolv 'd to be patient till I could fix on somebody . I generally missed 2 Guineas every other Morning , therefore used to keep myself awake as long as I possibly could , not knowing at what Hour he might come in . On Thursday Morning the 24th of last Month , the Prisoner came into my Room : He came to the Bed Side to listen whether I was a sleep , and I breath 'd hard as if I had been asleep He then went from the Bed Side , upon which I raised myself up , and look 'd through the Curtain , and I saw him take my Breeches off the Window , and go off with them into an opposite Chamber . I immediately got out of Bed , and look 'd at him , and I saw my Breeches on the Chest . He had taken my Purse out of my Pocket , and I saw him take something out of the Purse and put into his own Pocket , and then he put the Purse into the Breeches in order I suppose to return them into my Chamber . I imagined that he had taken some Money , and I thought it was then a proper Time to go out and seize him , accordingly I went in upon him , and took him by the Collar . He was very much surprized , and while the Servants were in the Room , he denied that he knew any Thing of the Matter ; but when they were withdrawn , he fell on his Knees and begg 'd that I would not take away his Life . The Night before this I counted my Money when I went to Bed , and put 10 Guineas in my Purse , and when I examined it next Morning , there were but 8 remaining . When I went before Mr. Deveil , I desired to have a Search Warrant , and I sent for the Prisoner 's Box . He then fell on his Knees and said he had taken but 10 Guineas , but I think we found in the Box 18 Guineas and some Silver , and 3 Guineas he had in his Pocket , all which he said was mine , and desired it might be given to me . John Brown . I have known the Prisoner about 3 Quarters of a Year , and never heard any Thing against his Character before . Henry Trotter . I have known him upwards of 3 Years : He lived with Mr. Drummond at Charing Cross , and then I believe he behaved well . Michael Laban . I am his Brother , and have known him from his Infancy , and never heard but that he had an honest Character . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 45 , 46.

Last Christmas Eve I was going thro ' Black Boy Alley , in Chick Lane , and a Couple of Women laid hold of me , and ask 'd me to give them a Dram , I said , I had no Money to spend , and could not stay , and then they took hold of me , and said , they would give me one as it was Holyday Time . They push 'd me in at Henry Gray 's Door , - I ca n't justly say that the Prisoner was one of them that laid hold of me first , but she was in the Room when I came in . They call 'd for a Dram and drank it , but did not give me any , upon which I told them my Business call 'd me , and I must go . Then they said , if I would not have any more , I should pay for what had been call 'd in , and they began to swear and threaten me , therefore I pulled out my Money to pay for it , and they seeing my Money , that Woman at the Bar laid hold of my Hand and took it from me . There were three Guineas in Gold , a Moidore , a French Crown , some Silver , and a few Halfpence ; the whole I believe was about 5 l. 6 s or thereabouts .

Yes , and there were 2 or 3 Women , but I ca n't be certain that the Prisoner was one of them . Phillis Moore . I was in the House when the Prisoner was taken up , which was on Christmass Eve , and that Man in the white Coat and white Wig , ( Sugden ) came in with the Constable , and said he had lost so much Money , and right or wrong he would swear to the Prisoner . I was there when the Man came in first and the Prisoner was not then in the House , but came in a Quarter of an Hour afterwards . He might as well charged me as her . I did not see him pull out any Money , neither did I hear any Cry of Murder , but there was something of a Noise above-Stairs , and then I went out . Edward Lyon .
