See the Sessions Paper , Number V. Pages 131 and 151 . W. Hartly . I had been at London , and returning homeward , I went to ease myself in a Ditch in White-Horse-Field , in Radcliff , and afterwards , it being sultry hot , and my Shoes ( which were new ) drawing my Feet , I pull 'd them off , and slapping my Hat over my Face , I laid down and fell asleep . I was waked by Somebody 's twitching my Hat away , for I had put the Loop of it about my Finger . I started up upon my Breech , and , God ! says I , where 's my Shoes and Buckles ? Says a Man , who was not far from me , There goes he that has got 'em , and pointed to the Prisoner , who was running off . I saw my Hat in his Hand , and followed him barefoot . He dropp 'd my Hat , and jump 'd over a Bank into a Garden , and I after , and took him . Now are not you a Rascal , says I , to rob a Man of his Clothes ? You think to get the Devil and all of a Man , if he is but a little tight and clean . He called after the other Man , who followed at a Distance , and said , Jack ! where ' the Man 's Shoes ? but he sheer 'd off . Then , says the Prisoner , if you 'll go with me to Rag-Fair , plausible you may find him a selling them . So I collar 'd him , and took him with me , and he went from one Place to another under that Pretence , but only wanted an Opportunity to get off ; and so I got Help and secured him . Sam Clemson . The Prisoner and Prosecutor had a sort of Tustle just by our Door , so I went and took hold of the Prisoner . Damn you , says he , you 're no Officer , and I 'll tip you up , if you do n't loose my Collar ; but I held him 'till an Officer , Thomas Colvert , came . Thomas Colvert . The Prisoner offered to make it up , and pay for the Shoes and Buckles ; but I carried him before the Justice , who presently knew him , and said , How long have you been out ? Did not I commit you and two or three more , a little while ago ? Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7. John Bromley , was indicted for stealing 525 Guineas , 5 Moidores , 2 half Moidores , 1 Broad Piece , value 23 s. a quarter Broad Piece , value 5 s. 9 d. 5 quarter Guineas , 1 Portugal Piece , value 9 s 40 l. in Silver , 8 Gold Rings , value 40 s. a Canvas Bag , a Silk Purse , and a Thread Purse , the Goods of Thomas Dyer , in his House , August the 2d last . Thomas Dyer . I keep a Turner 's Shop just without Newgate ; the Prisoner is my Apprentice ; he has served me six Years ; he made an Elopement from me about this time Twelvemonth ; but upon his returning home after above four Months Absence , I forgave him what was past . On the 2d of August last I went with my Wife to Harrow , and as soon as I came home my Daughter told me that I had been robb 'd ; that the Prisoner went away between six and seven in the Evening , which was about an Hour and a half before my Return ; that upon missing him they had some Suspicion , and went up and found my Drawers broke open ; upon which , they inform 'd my Neighbours , Mr. Brown and Mr. Sheppard , of what had happen 'd . Court . Did you leave your Drawers lock 'd ? Mr. Dyer . Yes ; that very Morning I took 10 s. out of one of the Drawers , and lock 'd it , and saw all the rest were fast , but at my Return I found them all broke open . In one Drawer there was between 70 and 80 l. taken out , 500 Guineas from another , and the third was a little Drawer , in which my Wife had laid up several remarkable Pieces for my Children , Crowns , Half-crowns , Silver Groat , Three-pences , Two-Pences and Pennies , and these were all taken away . The Prisoner was taken in about five Hours after , with all the Money upon him , except 15 l. 4 s. which he had laid out in buying a great Coat , Whip , Boots , Sputs , a Trunk to put the Money on , and several other odd Things . I went in Pursu't of him towards Harwich , but he was taken in Kent by others who followed him in Dover Road . I did not see him till the Saturday following , and then he confess 'd to me that he had broke open my Drawers , and taken my Money . Thomas Hancock . Two Hours after the Robbery Mr. Brown and Mr. Sheppard sent for me , and told me the Prisoner had robbed his Master of 5 or 600 l. and desired me to go in Pursuit of him . It happen 'd that I took Post horse at the same Inn as the Prisoner did ; and at the second Stage , which was Dartford in Kent , I heard that such a Person as the Prisoner was but just gone out of the Inn , and could hardly he got 40 Yards off . I follow 'd , and in about two Miles he was stopp 'd by another Person who had got the Start of me , and brought him back , and we return 'd to the Inn at Dartford . John , says I , how do ye do ? - How do you do ? says he again . God , says I , John , I am glad to see you ; where is the Money ? 'T is in that Trank , says he I ask 'd him how much there was ? He said he had not told it yet , but had intended to tell it as soon as he came to Rochester . Upon searching I found there was 546 l. 3 s. 6 d. in the Trunk , besides other Money that he had about him . Then he gave me a Seal with which I scal 'd up the Trunk He confess 'd very readily , and was willing to come home with me , but we sat up there all Night . I ask 'd him how he could serve his Master so , and what he had propos 'd to do with the Money ? He said , his Master was a good Master , and that he intended to make his Master Returns in Goods for the Money , designing to go directly to France , and so to Legborn , and from thence to send over Bermudas Hats to his Master . It seems there was some Money in his Clothes that were in the Trunk , which I did not see . He was afterwards sent to Maidstone Goal , from whence he was removed hither by a Habe Corpus . The Prisoner had nothing to say in his Defence , and the Jury found him Guilty Death . 8. John Welch , was indicted for the Murder of John Ashwell , by throwing him on the Ground , and striking him with both his Hands and Feet on the Stomach , Breast , Belly , Sides , and Groin , and thereby giving him several mortal Wounds and Bruises , on the 24th of June last , of which he languished 'till the 29th of the same Month , and then died . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . At the Prisoner 's Prayer the Witnesses against him were examined separately . Thomas Eastmend . About two Months ago on a Sunday , between five and six in the Afternoon , as I was standing at the Nag 's Head Tavern Door in Prince's-street , by Drury-lane , where I ply as a Porter , I saw two Porters coming along Prince's-street , one was the Porter at the Swan Tavern in Cornhill , and the other was John Sudlow , the Porter to the Ship behind the Exchange Sudlow pick 'd up a Six-pence , and said to the other Porter , Look here , I have found Six-pence . Some Irishmen , of whom the Prisoner was one , coming behind them , and hearing what Sudlow said , they ask 'd if he had found Six-pence ? He said yes . Why then , says one of them , 't is mine . How do you know , says Sudlow , has it any Mark ? Damn you , says the other , 't is mine , and I 'll have it . Well then , says Sudlow , you shall have it , if you 'll give me a Pint of Beer . No , damn you , says the Irishman , I 'll have it without , or I 'll have as much out of your Bones . Sudlow , at last , gave him the Six-pence , and as soon as he had got it he knock 'd Sudlow down with a Stick , though there was no Provocation given ; and then the rest of the Irishmen fell upon him too : Some of them had Sticks , but I ca n't say the Prisoner had any ; so they all fell to fighting : Sudlow was very much abus 'd , and cut in the Head . He went into the House , and got his Head dress 'd , and then coming out again , they fell upon him afresh . The Deceased was then standing at the Tavern Door in his Waistcoat . He was a Soldier , but had no Sword nor Stick , for he had been at Work ; and seeing how they abused Sudlow , he said , What barrarous Villains these are to use a poor Man in such a Manner , without any Occasion . Upon which the Prisoner step 'd up to him , and said , Damn you , you Rascal , do you Chatter ? At this the Deceas 'd began to strip ; but , before he could get his Clothes off , and while his Arms were pinion 'd behind him , being part out and part in the Sleeves , the Prisoner fell upon him , and knock 'd him down against the Bench with his Fist , by which Blow the Deceas'd 's Lip was cut thro ' , and then , holding the Deceas 'd up against the Bench with his Knee , beat him in a violent Manner , and afterwards kick 'd him on the Belly , so that his Belly was broke . Prisoner . At first you said the Deceas 'd was only in his Waistcoat , and now you swear that he was pulling his Coat off when I struck him . Court . He did not say his Coat , but his Clothes . Prisoner . Had I any Stick ? Eastmead . I do n't say you had . Prisoner . Was I concern 'd in abusing the Porter that found the Six-pence ? Eastmead . You was in Company with the Irishmen who made the Riot , but I ca n't say that I saw you strike the Porter . Court . Did the Deceas 'd offer to strike the Prisoner , or give him any Provocation ? Eastmead No , not at all . He was only going to pull off his Waistcoat to defend himself when the Prisoner threaten 'd him . Edw Andrews . When the Porter had pick 'd up the 6 d. the Prisoner and two or three more Irishmen follow 'd him , and one of 'em demanded the Six-pence . The Porter told them it was true he had found a Six-pence , but ask 'd them , how he should be sure it was theirs , except they could tell what Marks it had ? They swore they would not stand for Marks ; but Mark , or no Mark they would have it ; and one of them held up a Stick , and offer 'd to strike the Porter , and he , rather than be beat , gave the Six-pence to one of them , who , notwithstanding this , as soon as he had got it , knock 'd the Porter down , and beat him unmercifully . The Deceas 'd being just come to the Tavern Door , bid them not murder the poor Man , and told them , it was very barbarous to abuse him in that Manner ; upon which the Prisoner came up to him , and said , Damn you , what Business have you to chatter ? and with that , the Deceas 'd open 'd his Waistcoat , and was going to pull it off ; but while his Arms were pinn 'd behind him , as he was pulling them out of his Waistcoat Sleeves , the Prisoner fell upon him , knock 'd him backwards , and gave him at least a dozen Blows , tho ' the Deceas 'd made no Defence , for he was not able to do it , because his Arms were confin 'd . Court . Are you positive the Deceas 'd did not strike ? Andrews . Yes , I am certain he did not offer to lift up his Hand to strike one Blow . Court . Did any but the Prisoner strike the Deceas 'd ? Andrews . No Body else struck him once ; and I believe he was out of his Senses in half a dozen Blows . The Prisoner punch 'd him in the Face and Stomach , and kick 'd him on the Belly . Court . Did no Body endeavour to prevent the Prisoner from abusing the Deceas 'd in such a Manner ? Andrews . No Body dar 'd to take the Prisoner off . for he and his Companions were all so desperate , that they knock 'd down all that came in their way . Prisoner . Did I hold him up with my Knee ? Andrews . I did not observe that . Thomas Sutton . The Deceas 'd and I , and Nathaniel Brooks , were going along Prince's-Street together , when a Man pick 'd up Six-pence , and said to another , who was with him , Jack , I have had good Luck , I have found Six-pence . The Prisoner and some other Irishmen over-hearing what was said , one of them claim 'd the Six-pence , and after he had got it , he fell upon the Man that gave it him , and so they all went to fighting . The Deceas 'd said to some of them , I hope you wo n't murder the Man ! And the Prisoner answer 'd , Damn you , do you Chatter ? I 'll settle you presently : Upon which the Deceas 'd began to pull off his Waistcoat , and when it was half off , the Prisoner fell upon him , threw him upon the Nag's-Head Bench , cut his Lip by dashing his Hand in his Face , and punch 'd and kick 'd him on the Breast and Belly . Court . Are you sure the Deceas 'd did not strike the Prisoner ? Sutton . Yes , I am positive he did not , for his Hands were not at Liberty ; - and the Prisoner struck at him with such Violence , that he struck his Hand thro ' the Sash window of the Nag's-Head . Nathaniel Brooks . The Deceas 'd and I , and Thomas Sutton , seeing a Quarrel as we were going thro ' Prince's-Street , halted at the Nag's-Head Door . Two Porters coming along , one of them pick 'd up Six-pence , and the other said , We 'll have a full Pot out of it . One of the Irishmen who were quarrelling came up and said , That 's my Six-pence ; and he who found it , said , There 's no swearing to Money ; but afterwards he gave it to the Irishman , who presently ( to reward him for his Civility ) knock 'd him down , and so they all went to fighting , till at last the Man , who found the Money , was laid for dead . The Deceas 'd seeing this , went over to them , and said , Gentlemen , do n't murder the Man ; upon which the Prisoner went up to him , and struck him down on a Bench betwixt two Posts . Court . In what Posture was the Deceas 'd when the Prisoner struck him ? Brooks . Posture ? He was in no Posture at all , he stood as I do now , with his Hands behind him , pulling off his Waistcoat - He was in a red Waistcoat , and the Prisoner in a green Waistcoat . Court . But did he offer to strike the Prisoner ? Brooks . He did not , but I believe he would have done it , with a proviso the Prisoner would have given him Liberty ; but the Prisoner fell upon him before he could get his Arms clear from his Waistcoat . John Sudlow . Going along Prince 's Street with another Porter , I stoop 'd down , and took up a Six-pence . Luck Thee here I says I to him , I have found Six-pence . What , says he , best Thee found Six-pence ? that 's good Luck indeed , let 's have a full Pot out of it ? Some Men follow 'd us , and one of them own 'd the Six-pence , which at last I gave him , and as soon as he had got it , he knock 'd me down with a Stick , and I saw several Sticks among them . John Dennis , Surgeon . The Deceas 'd dy 'd on Friday , the 29th of June , and on the Saturday I open 'd his Body . There was a Braise six Inches long in the Groin a little above the O Pubs , and upon opening the Abdoman , I found the Intestines were forced into the Scrotum . They were turned black , and the Stench was very offensive This Rupture was the cause of his Death ; it was impossible he should have liv 'd in that condition , for it hinder 'd all the Operations of Nature , so that he could neither make Urine nor go to Stool , but whatever he took in could have no Passage taro ' him , but must have been discharged again at his Mouth , and he must have lain in violent Torment . Elizabeth Ashwell . The Deceas 'd was my Husband . He was brought home on Sunday Evening in a sad Condition . He was cut and wounded in his Face and Head , and bruised in several Parts of his Body . On Monday his private Parts were swell 'd up bigger than my two Fists ; I sent for Mr. Godfrey , a Surgeon , belonging to the Guards , and he order 'd some Stuff to bathe him with , but it did not abate the Swelling , and my poor Husband was in such Torment , that he could not rest Night nor Day , but cry 'd out like a Woman in Labour , from the Time he was brought home , to the Time of his Death , which was on the Friday Morning following ; he had no Passage below , he never went to Stool or Urine the natural way , but all came up at his Mouth ; and before this happen 'd he was very well , and in as good a State of Health as any Man in this Court . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . I din 'd at my Aunt 's in Rosemary-Lane , and was going home to my Wife , and coming into Prince 's Street , I saw a Mob there , but no quarrelling for it was all over before I came . But I saw the Deceas 'd there with his Coat off , and his Waistcoat was all dirty if he had been in the Kennel I ask 'd , what was the Matter ? and the Deceas 'd answer 'd , I have beat two of your Country Teagues , and now I 'll beat out for a Third ; upon which he struck me , and Inllargger 'd over the Kennel , but recover 'd my self , I struck at him again , and he giving way fell backwards against the Bench , and some how or other , the Nag's-Head Window was broke , and being afraid thev 'd keep me to pay for the Damage , I went off . But it 's plain had no design to quarrel , for I did not pull off a Stitch of my Clothes . Court . As the King 's Witnesses were examin 'd a part , let those for the Prisoner be examin 'd in the same Manner . John Macdonald . I saw the Fray in Prince's-Street , on Sunday the 24th of June , at three in the Afternoon . A young Man coming by the George Alehouse , stoop 'd down , and took up six-pence . Another Man demanded it of him , and they were going into the George ; but Mr. Lynch , who keeps the House , shut the Door upon them , and so a Mob gathering , there was a general Quarrel , and one side drove t'other into Drury-Lane . Court . Into Drury-Lane ? Macdonald . Yes ; but they came back again into Prince's-Street . Then the Deceas 'd ( who was a Soldier ) came up , in a very dirty pickle indeed , as if he came out of a Hog-Sty , and as if there was no Water in the Land or the Kennel . And then the Prisoner , whom I never saw before , - Court . Then look at him , are you sure that 's he ? Macdonald . Yes , I know him very well . Court . What and never saw him before ? Macdonald . Not before that time , but I know him very well now . He came up and ask 'd what was the Matter ? and the Deceas 'd said , I came from beating two Irish Teagues , you are the Third , and upon that he struck the Prisoner . Court . Are you sure the Deceased struck him first ? Macdonald . Yes ; and then another Man came with a Stick and cut the Prisoner over the Head , and made him reel . I saw the Blood run down , and cry 'd , O fie for Shame ! Two upon one ! Then the Prisoner struck the Deceas 'd , and the Mob edged the Deceas 'd on , and cry 'd , Well done , Soldier ! In the Scuffle the Deceas 'd fell back over a Bench , and his Head fell thro ' the Nag's-Head Window . The Prisoner hearing the Window broke , went off for fear they should make him pay for it . Court . And you swear the Deceas 'd gave the first Blow ? Macdonald . Upon my Oath , Madam , he struck the Prisoner twice before the Prisoner touch 'd him . Court . Here are four or five Witnesses , who have sworn the direct contrary : I say , Sir , Who are you ? Is there any Body can prove you were there at that time ? Macdonald I 'll bring ten thousand People to my Reputation ; you may enquire my Character of the best Quality in England , in Duke-Street or Lincolns-Inn-Fields - There were a hundred People heard me cry , Fie for Shame . Court . But are any of those People here ? You the King 's Witnesses , did any of you see this Witness there ? All . No ; we never saw him before . Court . You hear he swears the Deceas 'd gave the first Blow ? All . 'T is false ; he was not able to strike at all ; his Arms were pinion 'd down , he did not strike a Blow from first to last . Court . He swears the Deceas 'd said , He had beat two Teagues , and would beat him for the Third . All . No such Words were spoke , and we were there all the while . Macdonald . And I was there from the Beginning to the End . Court . And did not you see the Deceas 'd endeavour to pull off his Waistcoat ? Macdonald . No . Court . Is there any one of your own Witnesses that can prove your being there ? Macdonald . Yes , there 's Mary Murphy . Court . Call her in . Mary Murphy . I live in Prince's-Street , and saw the Quarrel from the Beginning to the End . I was at the George with some Irishmen , who came to take their Leave of me , and three more of their Countrymen , Thomas Digneil , Daniel Affer , and another , whose Name I do n't know but by Sight . Court . Look about , do you see him here ? Murphy . No ; but he and Dignell and Affer went away before the Quarrel begun ; the other Men staid standing at the George Door , and I saw one of them handle some Money , but did not see him drop any . While they were there , two Men came by , and one of them took up a Six-pence . One of the others said , it was his Six pence , and he would have it , or else he would be it out of him ; and with that he up with a Stick and knock 'd him down , and so two Couple of them fell to fighting . Court . Did you the Deceased there ? Murphy . I saw a Man in the Crowd in a Soldier 's Coat . - I think it was a Waistcoat . Court . Did you see the Prisoner strike the Deceased ? Murphy . I ca n't say as to that , but I saw the Prisoner come into the Crowd . Court . Did you see the Deceased strike him ? Murphy . No , I saw Nobody strike the Prisoner . Court . Do you know one Macdonald ? Murphy . Yes . - This is he with the black Brows . Court . What Business does he follow ? Murphy . I do n't know , except he 's a Clergyman . Court . A Clergyman ! Murphy . Yes , but he 's in another Dress now . Court . Does he use to appear in a Clergy-man 's Dress ? Murphy . Yes , it 's the common Dress he walks the Streets in . Court . Did you see him there ? Officer . My Lord , he makes a Sign to her . - He winks upon her . Court . What do you mean by that , Sir ? - Upon your Oath , Woman , did you see him here ? Murphy . No , I did not see him . John Kent . I saw the Deceased very dirty coming from Drury-lane with a Mob behind him . He struck the Prisoner twice , and made him stgger . Court . Before he was struck by the Prisoner ? Kent . Yes , but then the Prisoner recovering struck him again , and he fell back against a Window , and broke it with his Head . Another Man struck the Prisoner on the Head with an Oak Stick , and made his Head bleed . Court . Was this before or after the Prisoner struck the Deceased ? Kent . Before . Court . And after the Deceased had struck him twice ? Kent . Yes . Court . So he fell upon the Prisoner , not because the Prisoner struck him twice ; for , auseems , he bore that patiently , but because other Man afterwards came and broke his Head . - Did any of the King 's Witnesses see any Body strike the Prisoner with a Stick ? All . No , nor with any Thing else . Mary Conner . There was a great Throng , and the Deceased was full of Dirt , and the Prisoner came and asked What was the Matter ? Matter ! you Rascal , says the Deceased , do you want to fight ? Court . Did you hear him say nothing of beating two Teagues ? Conner . No , but he struck the Prisoner three or four Blows , and beat him over the Kennel , and then went off . Court . Three or four Blows ! Conner . Yes , and then another Man knocked the Prisoner down with a Stick , and the Mob cry 'd , O fye , that 's too much ! two to one ! Then the Prisoner struck the Deceased , who fell with his Head through the Window . Court . Where do you live ? Conner . I live upon the Strand . The Deceased was drunk , and his Clothes were all dirty . King 's Witnesses . His Clothes were not dirty , nor was he at all in Drink . Thomas Jones . I was one of the Coroner 's Jury that sat upon the Deceased , and three or four Days after Mr. Macdonald came to my House , and said , he wish 'd he had known before that I was upon the Jury , because he would have told me the Deceased gave the first Blow . Court . But he might have acquainted the Jury with it , whether he knew you were one of them or not . Are you an Irishman too ? Jones . Yes . Philip Macdonald . While the Prisoner and the Deceased were fighting , another Man knocked the Prisoner down with a Stick , and the Prisoner rising again knocked the Deceased backward through the Nag's-Head Window . George Anderson . I saw the Prisoner and the Deceased talking together ; the Deceased struck him in the Face , and , I believe he tumbled down the Kennel , and when he got up the Deceased struck him again , and another Man broke his Head with a Stick , and then the Prisoner beat the Deceased . Court . Because another Man broke his Head . James Warner , for the Prosecutor . I was Drawer at the Nag's-Head . Some Irishmen were standing at the George Alehouse Door , which is kept by an Irishman . A Porter came by and found Six-pence ; the Irishmen claim 'd it . They fell to fighting . The Porter was very much abus 'd . The Deceased asked them , Why they used the Man so barbarously ; and the Prisoner asked him what he wanted , or why he chatter 'd ? Upon which the Deceased went to pull off his Waistcoat ; but while his Arms were pinion 'd the Prisoner fell upon him , and beat him unmercifully upon the Stomach and Belly . The Deceased did not strike one Blow , first or last ; nor did any Body else strike the Prisoner , nor was his Head bloody . I did not see John Macdonald there , but I think I saw Murphy . Court . If the Deceased was going to take the Part of a Man that was abused , it was so far from being a Provocation sufficient to justify the other in killing him , that it was not only a lawful , but a commendable Action ; and where there is no Provocation given the Law implies Malice , and he that maliciously kills another , is guilty of Murder . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaughter only . [ Branding . See summary . ] 9.

My Goods and Money were taken off the Bed where I lay . A little Boy ( Wm Newell ) afterwards inform 'd me who did it . I ask 'd him if he did not see me a-bed ? and he answer 'd , No ; but I felt you , and we had taken more , but we were frighted by Somebody 's calling up a Midwife next Door , and so we ran away with what we had got . Will . Newell .

Sarah Robinson , was indicted for privately stealing a gold Ring from the Person of Mary Till , Aug. 15 . Mary Till . I keep a Chandler 's Shop in Scotland-yard , and this good Woman that pick 'd my Pocket is Servant to Mr. Vanbritton , and so as I was a suckling my Child , she comes in and asks for a Dram , and Ann Edson was sitting in the Shop ; and so says I , Pray , Mrs. Robinson , be pleas 'd to serve yourself ; and so she took a Dram and came and cower 'd herself down by me . I heard something jink , and catch 'd her Hand in my Pocket , but she said it was only in Accidence , and so I never intrusted that she had taken any Thing . This was a Tuesday Morning , and next Morning I told Mrs. Olive Cross of it , and as how I had lost my Ring , and she afterwards comes to me and says , Mrs. Robinson is fuddled , and has drove the House of her Master , and I wish she do n't lay this Ring to my Charge . Whereof I sent to her Master , and he sent me Word I should have my Ring , or Satisfaction , if I insisted in the Robbery , and I do insist in it , because when I took her Hand out of my Pocket it was clench 'd . Court . But why did not you open her Hand to see whether she had the Ring or not ? M. Till . Its all one for that ; I know as many good Things as another ; I ha n't liv 'd so long in the World for nothing ; I know what belongs to the Law better than any Body can tell me , and if I put my Hand in any Body 's Pocket , whether I take any Thing out or not , I say its a Robbery . Court . That , indeed , is more than the Court knew before . Olive Cross . I went to the Prisoner 's Master 's , and she came out of his Room in her Shift , though it 's well known he has got a W ife and five Children ; and she said as how they had had some Words , and she got a Ring upon her Finger , and said it was so little that she could not get it off , and so she soap 'd it , and bath 'd her Hand in Suds . Laud , says I , this is like Mrs. Till 's Ring . Gode daum you , says she , she never bade such an a Ring in her Leef ; and afterwards she said , her Master had the Ring , and then she sent to borrow three Rings to see whether I would swear my parjur 'd Oath upon the wrong Ring , and so I went and told Mrs. Till how and about it . Ann Edson . I saw the good Woman 's Hand in Mrs. Till 's Pocket , whereof Mrs. Till said , There 's no Pears in that Pot . Court . Was not the Prisoner drunk ? A. Edson . Not so drunk as that comes to , neither . Prisoner . I wo n't swear but I touch 'd her Pocket , but my Hand was not in it ; for I went to change a Guinea and laid it in her Lap , and she said she never see it , and bid me look if I did not drop it , and so she turn 'd her Money out of her Pocket . M. Till . This was two Months before I lost the Ring . Mr. Vanbritton . The Prisoner has lived with me 14 Years ; I have trusted her with all I had ; she is a very honest Creature , and was a good Customer to the Prosecutor , for she has laid out five or six Shillings in a Week with her , and all the Fault she had was , that she would let the Prosecutor entice her to get drunk at her Shop . - Pointer . I heard the Prosecutor swear , that if she could be revenged on the Prisoner , she would be content to be rack 'd to Death next Moment . - And I heard her say , she would have her Revenge of the Beast if she swore thro ' a two Inch Board . The Jury acquitted her , and the Court granted her a Copy of her Indictment . 13.

On the 28th of July , just at Midnight , as I was crossing Lincoln's-Inn-Fields , I was set upon by five Men ; it was a very clear Star-light Night , and I could see very plainly . Grace came up first , took me by the Collar , and said , Damn you , you Dog , stand , and deliver your Money ; if you speak a Word you are a dead Man . I look 'd him very hard in the Face . Two others then rifled my Pockets , and while they were taking my Money , a short Man in a Cap and a blue Jacket , whom I take to be Richardson , came behind me , struck me on the Arm and took my Hat and Wig . - I look 'd over my Shoulder and saw him . - Him and Grace I remember , but I do n't know Smithson . - Grace held me fast , but took nothing from me . Grace . How long was it after the Robbery before you saw me ? Gordon . It was about a Fortnight . You were then before the Justice . Alexander Watson . The Prisoners and I and Tom Whithy agreed to go to Lincoln's-Inn Fields together . Richardson , indeed , did not agree to rob , but Grace swore by God he 'd attack the first Man he met , and that prov 'd to be the Prosecutor . Grace collar 'd him , and Whithy and I search 'd his Pockets . He took half a Guinea , and I took 5 d. Court . Who took his Hat and Wig ? Watson . I took them , and Grace struck him over the Hand with an Oak-Stick . Gordon . I am positive it was the Man in the Cap and blue Jacket that did both . Watson . Its true , Richardson was in a blue Jacket , but he would not have had us to have gone a Robbing that Night . Court . Did he leave you then before the Robbery ? Watson . No , he was with us . - He was behind the Gentleman . Court . How far distant ? Watson . He was within Reach of the Gentleman . Gordon . Yes , I look 'd behind , and saw him take my Hat and Wig . Watson . This was about twelve a Clock on Friday Night , and about one a Clock next Morning we attack 'd a Man ( Mr. Spencely ) in Holborn , and were taken by the Watch , and sent to Clerkenwell . Roger Leak . I am Watchman at the upper End of Bedford-Row . I heard Mr. Spencely call out , Watch ! stop'em ! - Richardson , who was in a Linen Cap and blue Jacket , came running along , and I stopp 'd him between the upper End of Featherstone-Buildings , and the upper End of Hand-Alley , and carry 'd him to Mr. Spencely , who had taken Watson himself . This was about One in the Morning . Samuel Slack . And between One and Two I found this Hat and Wig hard by the Place where Richardson was taken . Gordon . This is my Hat and Wig . Richard Shorter . Watson declar 'd to me in New-Prison , that Richardson was not in this Robbery . Watson . I said he was in the Fields with us , but was not willing to rob with us . Shorter . He , indeed , said so at last , - and I ask 'd him why he did not put Richardson in his first Information ; and he told me he was willing to save him . Smithson . I think I have drank in Watson 's Company , and he being taken up , his Wife , Peg Yately , told me , that he had inform 'd against me ; so I went to see him in New Prison , and gave him half a Pint of Gin , and he assur 'd me he had nothing against me ; I was taken that Night , but I was not in his first Information which he made before Justice Robe . Watson . I told Justice Robe 's Clerk , that we all went to a Night-House in the Strand , then another House in Shug-L ane , and so to Lincoln's-Inn-Fields , and I nam 'd all their Names to the Clerk , but he forgot Smithson , and so his Name is interlin 'd . Smithson . I have no Witnesses , for I have been under Misfortunes before . William Cross . I have known Richardson from a Child ; his Parents live in Eagle-street , Soho ; he follows no Employment , but lives with his Father , who has an Estate to support his Family ; I know no Ill of him , - but I ha n't seen him much for these last six Months . Another . He came from Sea eight or ten Months ago , and had the Misfortune to fall into this ill Company . Some others depos 'd , that they had never heard any Ill of Richardson before this Time . Watson . I have known Richardson several Years ; he and I were three Months in Clerkenwell Bridewell for a Street-Robbery , but there being no Indictment we were discharged - After I had made my first Information before Justice Robe , several Thief-Catchers , - there 's George Vaughan , alias my Lord Vaughan , for one , - came to me in New-Prison , and made me drunk , and would make me make another Information before Justice Midford , who came down to me in New-Prison . - These Thief-Catchers will do any Thing for Money . Court . Upon your Oath was Richardson in the Robbery ? Watson . Yes . Court . Was Green ? Watson . Yes . Court . And Smithson ? Watson . Yes ; they were all three present . Court . You have appear 'd very willing to screen Richardson . Has Nobody endeavour 'd to persuade you not to swear against him ? Watson . Yes , there was an Attorney came to New-Prison , and enquir 'd for me ; and when I was brought to him , he call 'd for a Bowl of Punch , and bad me sit down and drink heartily , and when that Bowl was out we had another . He told me that Richardson 's Father was a good 'Sponsible Man , and if I would clear Richardson , and leave him out in my Information , it should be better for me than I could expect . I told him , I was willing to do any Thing that I could , without hurting myself ; and , he said , I might save him without hurting myself , if I would but say he was not in the Robbery ; and that he would not offer to bribe me , but it should be better for me than I expected . - And others came to me afterwards on the same Account . Court . An Attorney do this ! What was his Name ? Watson . It was a cramp sort of a Name , I ca n't remember it just now , but I know the Man ; he 's a tall Man , I saw him in the Court a little while ago . - He stood in that Place . Officer . Was not his Name Wimpry ? Watson . Yes , that was the Name . Court . Call him into Court . Officer . Mr. Wimpry , an Attorney ! - He do n't answer . Court . Go , see if he 's in any of the Publick Houses hereabout . Then an Officer went out and brought Mr. Wimpry into Court . Court . Here , Sir , you are charg 'd with endeavouring to suborn Evidence . This Witness swears you treated him with two Bowls of Punch in New-Prison . and told him it should be better for him than he expected , if he would clear the Prisoner Richardson . John Wimpry . My Lord , I never had any such Design , nor ever told him any such Thing . - Indeed I call 'd for Punch , but it was in publick Company ; there were 40 People present . Court . Why did you treat him then ? Wimpry . It was only out of Curiosity . Court . Are you an Attorney ? Wimpry . Yes . Court . You ought to be struck off the Roll for this ; and if , before you go out of Court ; you do n't find Two to be Securities for your Appearance here at next Sessions I 'll commit you . Thereupon Mr. Richardson ( the Prisoner 's Father ) and another offer 'd to be his Securities , and were accepted . The Jury found the three Prisoners Guilty . Death . George Richardson , and Lawrence Grace , were a second Time indicted , for assaulting Francis Spencely , on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Linen Handkerchief , value 6 d. July 28 . F. Spencely . Between 12 and 1 in the Morning , as I was going by the End of Brownlow-street in Holbourn , I was attack 'd by three Persons , I am not positive that Grace was among them ; but Richardson , who was in a blue Jacket , and my Lord Watson - this little hump-back 'd Evidence - run against me , and one of them struck me with a Stick . I reel 'd against a Stationer 's Bulk , but presently recovering my self , I miss 'd my Handkerchief , and follow 'd them up Brownlow-Street , and at the Upper-end of it , next Bedford-Row . I took this little Hump-back . Watson . After the Robbery in Lincolns-Inn-Fields , we some how lost John Smithson . And seeing the Prosecutor , we run against him , and Richardson pick 'd a Handkerchief out of his Pocket , and then he was knock 'd down . We seeing that , and some People being not far off , we run for it . Grace got clear , but Richardson and I were taken ; he by the Watch , and I by the Prosecutor . Richardson afterwards told me , that he had nail 'd the Call of his Wipe , and ding 'd it down , and was afraid , God damn 'em ! that some of 'em had nail 'd it again - That is , he had taken the Man 's Handkerchief , and drop 'd it , and was afraid that some of the Watch had taken it up again . The Watchmen then depos 'd , as in the former Trial , that they found the Handkerchief , near the place were Richardson was taken . And the Prosecutor swore the Handkerchief was the same he lost , and that he knew by the Duty-stamp upon the Corner of it . The Jury acquitted them . 46 , 47. George Sutton * , and William Simonds + , were indicted for assaulting Philip Turst , in a Field near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him , a pair of silver Buckles , a Knee-Buckle , a Hat and a Wig , July 15 . * Sutton was an Evidence against C.

Turst . On Sunday Evening , between 9 and 10 , as I was going over Marybone-Fields , to my House at Paddington , I was stop 'd , by five or six Men , who knock 'd me down , and robb 'd me of my Hat and Wig , a pair of silver Buckles , and a Knee-buckle . They beat and bruis 'd me so unmercifully , that I was light-headed for a Week afterwards . It was a Moon-shiny light Evening , but I was so disorder 'd by their ill Usage , that I can not be positive to the Prisoners . Some Persons came to me the next Day , and told me , that they had seen the Prisoners in that Field the Night before , upon who , I go a Warrant , and took them up on Suspicion ; but none of my Things were found upon them . John Berry . Coming out of Marybone-Fields on Sunday Evening , I saw Sutton and Baker * and two more going in . As I knew the Characters of Sutton and Baker , I concluded they were going upon some Mischief . In three Quarters of an Hour , I was told there had been a Robbery , and I said , I thought so . I went to Mr. Turst , next Day , and his Brother came in , and brought a Pistol , and Mr. Turst 's Wig , which , he said , were found in the Field where the Robbery was done . I ask 'd Mr. Turst , If he should know any of the Persons who robb 'd him ? and he said , Yes , very well ; and he believ 'd there was one of the Suttons ( for there 's two Brothers of them ) if not both . * James Baker , otherwise Stick-in-the-Mud was try 'd with Philip Thomas , in July 1732 , for Robbing Catherine Burkett in the Street , and acquitted . See the Sessions-Paper for that Year , Numb . VI . p. 172 . Turst . I did not know them , but I had heard they frequented those Fields - i do n't deny but I might say so ; but I was so Bruised , that my Senses were almost gone , that I know not what I said . Berry . In his Affidavit , made before Justice Mercar , he swore , that he believ 'd the two Alexanders , Thomas and James , the two Prisoners , and James Baker , alias Stick-in-the-Mud , were the Men who robb 'd him . They were all taken up , and brought before the Justice , and he swore positively , that the Prisoners were two of the Men , and that he believ 'd James Baker and Thomas and James Alexander were the other three . He had describ 'd the Prisoners Clothes before they were brought in . Turst . The Bruises they gave me , made my Memory so bad , that I do n't remember any thing of it , and I do n't know if ever I shall have my Senses again . Berry . He could remember them well enough before he had been with Sutton 's Mother . Justice Mercer . On the 17th of July , when the Prosecutor came before me , he was at first very much out of order , and complained of his Head , and it was some time before he came to himself , and then I took his information . H swore , that about ten a Clock on Sunday Night , near the Burying ground , he was attack 'd by several Person , who robb 'd , and abus 'd him ; that Sutton and Simonds were two of the Men , and that he strongly suspected Baker and the two Alexanders . He describ 'd the Prisoners Clothes , that Sutton was in a dark Olive Coat , and Simonds in a black Waistcoat , and said , he remember 'd their Faces very well ; and when the Prisoners were taken , they answer 'd his Description . Turst . I was not in my Senses then . Court . And yet you could give a right Description of the Prisoners . - You could remember that one had an Olive Coat , and the other a black Waistcoat . Josiah Allen , Constable . I took up the five Persons , and carry 'd them before the Justice . The Prosecutor was there , I shew 'd him the two Alexanders and Baker . At first he said , he knew nothing of them , but afterwards , that he believ 'd they were in the Robbery . Then I brought in Sutton , who was in an Olive Coat , and as soon as the Prosecutor saw him , he said , That 's the Man who struck me and threw me down . Next I produced Simonds ( who was in a black Waistcoat ) and he declared that Simonds was another of them . I bid him have a Care , and be very cautions of what he swore , for the Mens Lives were at stake . His answer was , I am positive . Francis Waker . Before the Prisoners were taken , Mr. Turst describ 'd Simonds to be in a black Waistcoat , and Sutton in an Olive Coat , and they being taken in such Clothes , and brought before the Justice , when he was present , he said , he was certain both to Simonds and to Sutton . He was desired to be cautions , because the Mens Lives were at Stake ; but he said he was positive of it . - It was afterwards buzz 'd in our Neighbourhood , that he was about making the Matter up . I ask 'd his Wife about it , and she said , Mrs. Sutton had indeed been with her Husband , but he was a Man of more honour than to take Money to stop the Prosecution . And the Woman who keeps the Crow Alehouse , told me , that the Prosecutor and Sutton 's Mother had been at her House together . Court . What one or the other told you is no Evidence . Is either of them here ? Waker . Yes ; here 's Mrs. Turst . Court . Mrs. Turst , has Sutton 's Mother had any Conversation with your Husband ? Mrs. Turst . Yes ; she was twice at our House , after my Husband had sworn before the Justice . Court . And did she desire him not to Prosecute , or at least , to be favourable ? Mrs. Turst . Yes ; and he answer 'd , The Law should take place , and desir 'd her not to trouble him any farther , this was the first Time ; but she came again , and intreated for her Son , and protested he was innocent , and my Husband told her as before , that the Law should take place ; and I do n't know that he was with her afterwards at the Crow Alehouse or any where else . Robert Rolson . Two or three Days before the Robbery , I saw Sutton and another , buying a pair of Pistols , at a Broker 's in High-Holbourn . Rovert Draper . The Morning after the Robbery . I found the Prosecutor 's Wig and this Pistol in the Field where it was done . John Sheldon . I keep a Broker 's Shop , in High-Holbourn . About ten Weeks ago , two Men came into my Shop , and ask 'd for a Case of Pistols . I shew 'd them a pair , they look 'd on them , and ask 'd the Price , I told them 10 s. or 10 s. 6 d. I forget which , they laid them down , and went away . In a little time , they came again , and another Man with them , and said , they were dear ; I told them I would take no less , and then one of them gave me a Shilling Earnest , and said they would fetch them before Night , and at Night two of them came , and brought the rest of the Money and took them away . Court . Do you know the Prisoners ? Sheldon . No ; I do n't know that I ever saw them before . Court . At what time of the Day were those three Men at your Shop ? Sheldon . About the middle of the Day . Court . Draper , are you sure that Sutton was one of the three Men you saw looking on the Pistols in Sheldon 's Shop ? Draper . Yes . Court . At what time of the Day was it ? Draper . About one a-Clock . Court . Shew that Pistol to Sheldon . Sheldon . This is one of those Pistols I sold to those three Persons that Day . Prisoner Simonds . Enquire into the Character of Berry , Draper , and Sheldon ; they live by nothing but taking Mens Lives away . Berry . I belong to the Brick-Field , where the Prisoners and a great many other loose Fellows frequently take up their Lodging . I have seen , I believe , 40 of 'em there ; and if you come any Day between two and three a Clock , you 'll be sure of seeing some of them . Court . We do n't desire to meet 'em there , but if you 'll bring 'em hither , we shall be glad to see 'em . The Jury acquitted them . 48. Ann Soames , otherwise Soanes , was indicted for stealing four Gold-Rings , four Handkerchiefs , four Suits of Head-Clothes , four pair of Ruffles , a pair of Stays , and 34 Guineas , the Goods and Money of Mary Cope , in the House of William Marter , June 27 . Mary Cope . I live at Mr. Marter 's ( a Linen-Draper ) in Audley-street , Grosvenor-Square . On the 27th of June , I went out about 7 in the Evening with a young Lady , whom I nurse for my Lord Albemarle , and left my Goods and Money lock 'd up in a Deal-box in my Chamber , I return 'd in about half an Hour , when the Prisoner was gone ; my Box was broke open , and 4 gold Rings , 4 Handkerchiefs , 4 Suits of Head-Clothes , 4 pair of Russles , a pair of Stays , and 34 Guineas were taken away . She was taken about 4 a Clock next Morning at the World's-End , at Newington-Butts . My Rings were found upon her , and my Money in her Pocket , which she deliver 'd , and confess 'd were mine . - Philips . I was in the Square with the Nurse and the young Lady . When we return 'd , and Mrs . Cope found she had been robb 'd , I went among the Hackney-Coachmen , and enquir 'd if they knew who had carry 'd such a Fare . By eleven at Night , I found the Coachman , who told me , that he took up such a Person in Brook-street , and carry 'd her to the Vine Tavern in Holbourn , where she treated him . Thence he drove her to London-Bridge , where she bought two gold Rings , and after that to the World's-End . I went to the World's-End after her , and saw her and a Man in their Shifts at the Window , but as soon as they perceiv 'd me , they shut the Sash down , and the Man and Woman of the House came in their Places , and ask 'd What I wanted ? I told them my Business , and they said there was no Body in the House but themselves . But when I got in , I took the Prisoner and the Man in the Yard , as they were getting over the Pails . How do you do , Nanny ? says I . Fellow , says she , I know you not . And at the same Time I perceived she was fumbling with her Fingers , to get the Rings off . I call 'd a Watchman , and searching her , found 31 Guineas , a half Crown , and 3 s. 6 d. in her Pocket . I ask 'd her whose Money that was ? and she answer 'd , What 's that to you , Fellow ? But next Morning she own 'd , that the Money , the Rings , a Necklace , and other Things that were found upon her were all her Mistress 's . The Prisoner had nothing to say in her Defence , and the Jury found her Guilty . Death . 49.

My Money was in a little Box , and the little Box was in a great Box in my Room , in Daniel Mackenzy 's House in the Haymarket . I saw the Money there on Sunday the 15th of July , which was 2 Days before I lost it , and I went out about my Business , and the Prisoner had the Keys of my Room to clean it , and she lived by Grays-Inn-Lane , and she was my Acquaintance ; and I came home again , and the Door was open , and so was my Box ; and the Money , and the Seal , and the Linen were gone . And I went after her , and took her by Brooks-Market , with my Linen , and 3 Handkerchiefs and a Stock ; and this Linen was 2 Yards of blue and white Linen , and it was in my great Box ; and she was rescued from me by 2 Men , and we had a Constable , but he had no Warrant , and so he said he could not hold her ; and afterwards we found her at Mr. Calender 's in Kingsland-Road with another Woman 's Husband that kept her Company , and we got a Warrant and carried her to Clerkenwell , and she confess 'd before the Justice .

We got a Constable , and coming to Saffron-Hill , 2 Men came up , and said , she should go no farther without a Warrant , and so she fell down , and we could not get her along . The Constable desir 'd us to make it up , because he could not carry her before his Majesty - the Magistrate , without a Warrant ; so she said she 'd give my Uncle the Remainder of the Money , which was 6 Shillings and a Penny , and he took it . Richard Penny . The same Morning the Prosecutor was robb 'd I saw the Prisoner in a Brandy Shop ; she pull 'd out nine or ten Guineas , and had got a new Gown and new Shoes and Clogs . I did not know of the Robbery then , but the Prosecutor told me of it soon after . We found her in Brooks-Market , and he said to her , Sarah ! how came you to rob me ? I rob you ? says she , here , take your Linen . So we got a Constable , but two Butchers rescued her , and she beat me , and threaten 'd to cut my Throat . Prisoner . The Prosecutor and I lived together as Man and Wife , but not contented with that , he lock 'd me up for three Weeks together , and would not let me see Man , Woman , nor Child ; and so at last I got away , and because I did not come home again when he would have had me , he said he would transport me . I have got three Love Letters here that he sent to me since I was in Newgate . Court . Powell , look on those Letters , did you send them to the Prisoner ? Powell . Yes , yes , I writ them , I have no Occasion to deny them . Court . Then they may be read in Evidence . The First Letter . Clerk reads .

John Cannon , was indicted for assaulting and carnally knowing Mary Faucet , Spinster , an Infant of 9 Years of Age , July 12 . Susan Faucet . The Prisoner is a Journeyman Weaver . I took him in to work for me . On the 12th of July I perceiv 'd a Disorder in my Child 's Linen . I went up Stairs to Mrs. Bishop , and told her my Daughter was very Forward . She ask 'd me how I meant forward ? I told her , and shew 'd her the Linen . She said , that could be no natural Thing , and bad me examine the Child , and so I did . I ask 'd her what was the Matter ? and promis 'd not to beat her , if she would tell me the Truth . Upon that , says she , As I was suting a Quilting upon the Bed , John Cannon came in and threw me upon the Bed , and pull 'd up my Coats and lay upon me , and hurt me very much , and put something in me . - Court . What Age is your Daughter ? S. Faucet . She was 9 Years old the 4th of June last . Mary Mason , Midwife . In July last ( the Day the Prisoner was sent to Newgate ) I was sent for , to search the Child ; she was in a very bad Condition , and had been grosly abused by a Man . Court . Had her Body been enter 'd ? Mason . Yes , she was torn as much as a Child could be . Court . How far do you think she had been penetrated ? Mason . I ca n't say exactly , but as far as could be in Reason . Court . In what Condition was her Linen ? Was it bloody ? Mason . Yes , and I ask 'd her how long it was since it was done ? and she said , the last time was about a Week before , and that he had done it 3 times . The outer Parts were ulcerous . I said , I believ 'd the Child had got an ill Distemper , and advis 'd them to go to a Surgeon , because I had no Judgement in those Things . They went , but when the Surgeons heard how it happen 'd , they would not be concern 'd in it for fear they should have the Trouble of attending at the Trial , and so the Child was forc 'd to be sent to an Hospital , from whence we brought her now . The Doctors there , said she must be laid down , but they would not do it till the Trial was over , because if they took her in Hand first , she could not be brought hi her . Court . Can you make any Judgment by what you saw on the Linen , whether there was an Emission of Seed ? Though it might not be decent on any other Occasion , yet as a Man 's Life is at Stake , there 's a Necessity for the Question . Mason . All I can say to it is , that her Shift was in a sad stiff Condition . Mary Bishop . The Prosecutor told me her Daughter was very forward ; How so ? says I . Why , come and see her Linen , says she . It can never be That , says I , at 9 Years of Age ; it must be something else , and therefore I would have you ask others that know more than I do . Court . In what Condition was her Linen ? Bishop . It was bloody , and very nasty . Court . In what Manner ? Bishop . It was greenish and whitish . Court . Can you form any Judgment from what you observ 'd , that there was any Emission of a Man 's Seed Bishop . I believe it was in part . Mary Sutherland . I am Nurse at the Hospital ; Mr. Fern examin 'd the Child ; she has a soul Glect , and is ulcerated in the privy Parts . - There 's an Ulcer in the Inside of the Lips of her Body . Nothing has been done to her yet , becau ' e 't is the Doctor 's Opinion she ca n't be cur 'd without a Salivation , and if she - had been put into one , she could not have attended at the Trily . Mary Faucet sworn . Court . Now you must be sure , Child , to swear nothing but the Truth ; for it would be a sad Thing if you should take away a Man 's Life wrongfully . Mary Faucet . Indeed , Sir , I will say nothing but the Truth . - I was working on the Bed , when John Cannon and the other Journeymen were gone to Dinner , and John Cannon came in and threw me on the Bed , took up my Coats and unbutton 'd his Breeches , and put something into me , - I do n't know what it was . Court . Where did he put it . M. Faucet . He put it in hero . Court . Did it enter your Body ? M. Faucet . Yes , and it hurt me very much , and I told him how he hurt me , and he said he did not care . Court . How long did he lye on you ? M. Faucet . A good while , and I cry 'd out , and he stopp 'd my Mouth with his Hand . Court . Did you perceive any Thing else ? M. Faucet . I felt something , but I do n't know what it was . Court . Did you perceive any Thing wet ? M. Faucet . Yes , it was wet ; and when he had wetted me he got off , and he said , if I told my Mother he 'd say it was Lies , and make me be whipp 'd for bad Quills and Worsted ; and then the other Journey men knock 'd , and he let 'em in , and they went directly to their Looms . - And he serv 'd me so 3 Days when they went to Breakfast and Dinner . Prisoner . 'T is they that have put these Things in her Head . - 'T is their Sin . Court . Was the Prisoner search 'd to see if he had any soul Diltemper upon him ? Prof . The Surgeon did not care to do it , for fear he should be oblig 'd to attend at the Trial . Prisoner . Did not you wash my Linen ? and did you discern any Thing ? Prosecutor . His Linen was wash 'd at my House , and I once suspected something , and ask 'd him about it ; and he said , he had got the Piles , and brought another Man to assure me it was so . But this was 2 Months before what happen 'd to my Child , and I have seen no Spots on his Linen since ; but I observ 'd one Thing , that ever after , when his Linen came to be wash 'd , the Fore-part of it always look 'd as if it had been dipp 'd in Water and wash 'd out before it came to me . Court . Did you ever tell him of this ? Prosecutor . No . Court . That 's strange ! Juryman . When the Prisoner was sent to Newgate , was any of the Linen left in your House ? Prosecutor . Yes . Court . What Condition was it in ? Prosecutor . Green and yellow . Prisoner . I beg that Linen may be brought . Court . Why did not you bring it ? Prosecutor . I thought it was great Confusion , and I was asham 'd - But I can send for it . Court . Do so . It is not , indeed , a very decent Sight , but in this Case its necessary . - Let the Prisoner stand aside a while . The Messenger who was sent for the Linen , being return 'd , the Prisoner was again set to the Bar . Prosecutor . This is my Child 's Shift . Court . I thought it was the Prisoner 's Shirt that was sent for ! Prosecutor . Then I mistook ; for I have not got his Shirt . Court . However , since the Shift is come , let the Jury look on it . - Is this the Shift the Child had on when she was abused ? Prosecutor . I ca n't say whether it 's that , or one she wore since , but it is very soul . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 73. Richard Lamb , was indicted for the Murder of Christian , his Wife , by throwing her down , and striking and kicking her on the Head , Neck , Breast , and Belly , and giving her , on the hinder part of her Head , one mortal Bruise and Fracture in her Skull , on the 30th of July last , of which she languish 'd till the 3d of August following , and then dy 'd . He was a second Time indicted , on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the said Murder . Mary Wood . I live in Nicholas-Alley , in Chick Lane . The Prisoner lives in the same Alley . I came home with my Husband , on Monday Night , a little after 12 , When I open 'd the Door the Deceas 'd ran in , and said , Save me , Woody , or I shall be kill 'd to Night . Who 'll kill you ? says I . My Husband will , says she . Phoo ! says I , do n't fright yourself - Sit down - Then she said she was very dry , and wish 'd I would fetch her a Pint of Drink from Mr. Palmers , which I did , and she drank of it . And then her Husband , the Prisoner came in , and without any Provocation knock 'd her down with his Fist , and kick 'd her on the Belly . She was stunn 'd with the Blows , and did not speak a Word . I told him , he should not have her home to kill . He ask 'd me , What I had to do with his Wife ? And bid me keep her at my Peril , and with that I takes him and pushes him out , and shuts the Door upon him . He threaten 'd to Sue my Husband for keeping his Wife from him , and at last my Husband knowing him to be a quarrel ome Fellow , put her out , and we went up Stairs . I look 'd out of the Window , and saw him knock her down in the Alley . It was then rull one a Clock ; some Man coming up the Alley took her Part . I he Prisoner ask 'd him , What Business he had betwixt a Husband and his Wife ? I call 'd to the Man , and said , Master , do n't mind him ; he beats his Wife every Day , and if you stand by her I 'll stand by you . Prisoner . Was not she in Liquor ? M. Wood . No more than I am now , if I was to die upon the Sacrament . Dorcas Bates . I was looking out of the Window , when the Deceas 'd came out of Mr. Wood 's House , I saw the Prisoner knock her down under the Window . She took hold of a Man 's Hand , and beg 'd him to stand by her ; but the Prisoner drag 'd her in a Doors , 'till next [ the same ] Morning , when she was taken up for dead , and carry 'd to Bed . Prisoner . Did not you tell me , on Tuesday Morning , that you saw nothing ? D. Bates . No ; and I would not say such a Thing , in the Condition I am in , if it was not true . Eliz . Halliston . On Tuesday Morning , when the Deceas 'd was dying , I heard some Neighbours ask her , Who beat her so ? She said , The Rogue her Husband . They ask 'd , With what ? She said , with the Heel of his Shoe . They ask 'd , If he did it at home ? She said , In her own Kitchen ; and that besides , he beat her with a great ragged sharp pointed Stick . They ask 'd , For what ? She said , she did not know . They ask 'd , Where she was hurt ? And she pointed , trembling , to her Head behind her Eat , and to her Neck , her Stomach , and her Breast - She dy 'd on the Friday following . Sarah Roswell . I heard her say , he knock 'd her on the Head with the Heel of his Shoe , and with a sharp rugged Stick , and she pointed to her Head , Neck , Stomach , and Back . I have seen Skarmishes by him many times before this . Dr. Stockden . I found the Deceas 'd Speechless . I suspected by the loss of Motion on one side of her Head , that there was a Fracture on the other , and according , the Head being open 'd , we found a Fracture on the Lamdoidal Suture . The Surgeon then there was a mere Concussion of the Drain , but it was my opinion , there was a Concussion and Depression - The Fracture was such , that no trapaning could save her Life . Mr. Lee , Surgeon . I saw the Deceas 'd 3 Days before she dy 'd : Her Breast was bruis 'd , and there was an Impression of a Key , with all the Wards , stamp 'd as plain , as if it had been made in Clay . I suppose she had the Key in her Bosom , and it was done by kneeling upon her . I let her Blood , and apply 'd a Blister , but she still grew worse ; and when she dy 'd I open 'd her Head , and found a Fracture in her Skull 2 Inches long , from the hinder part of the Skull to the Ear , which was the Occasion of her Death , for it was impossible she should live . I live not far from the Prisoner , and have many times had her as a Patient , with violent Bruises and Cuts , when she has been beaten by her Husband , and I have often told her , he would certainly kill her sometime or other . Eliz . Palmer . Between 7 and 8 , on Tuesday Morning , I heard an Outery , that the Deceas 'd was murder 'd . I did not wonder at it , for I had often heard the same . However , I went to see her , and found her speechless , but I fetch 'd some Drops and gave her , and then she came a little to herself . Who has misus 'd you so ? says I . The Rogue my Husband , says she . What did he beat you with ? - The Heel of his Shoe . - And with any thing else ? - Yes , with a nasty ragged , rough pointed Stick . - Did . he give you any thing to drink ? - Yes , a little sow ' r Ale . I ask 'd where she was hurt ? She trembl 'd , and pointed to her Head , Neck , Stomach , and Breast . I saw the impression of a Key , and something like Money on her Breast . She was carry 'd upfor for dead , and when the Surgeon came to bleed her , the Prisoner came up too , and said , Damn her , is not the old Bitch dead yet ! O fie ! says I . If she is not , says he , I will kill her , for I will be hang 'd for her . Pris . Was not she drunk ? E. Palmer . No , she was sober when I saw her at 11 a Clock o ' Monday Night . Pris . Did not she go to your House for Drink ? E. Palmer . No ; Mrs. Wood came for it . Court . If she was drunk , that will not justify you in killing her . Ann Toms . The Deceas 'd came to my House between 10 and 11 , on Monday Night , and said , she was very dry , and wish 'd she had a Pint of Beer ; but the Prisoner coming into the Alley , she went away without it , and I am sure she was sober then . Lucy Bates . I live next door to the Prisoner . I heard the Deceas 'd cry , Murder , before she came home , and I heard her groaning in the Kitchen all Night . - He beat her the Friday before , and I went in and desir 'd him to let her alone ; but he took up a Cleaver , and was going to split her Skull if I had not hinder 'd him . Richard Warrell . I was at the Barley-Mow , in Chick-Lane , between 9 and 10 on Monday Night , and the Prisoner was drinking in the same House . The Deceas 'd came in , and said , Do , dear Dicky Lamb , come home . He swore he would not , and call 'd for another Pint . She took up the Mug , and drank of it , upon which , he swore he would not pay for it , and , damn his Soul , he 'd make either Surgeon 's Work , or Jack Ketch 's that Night . Will . Johnson . The Deceas 'd was my Sister . I was sent for about 8 a Clock on Tuesday Morning , and was told she was kill 'd . I found her Speechless . I sent for Mr. Lee the Apothecary . The Prisoner was very angry , I desir 'd him to be quiet ; but he swore by God , if she was not dead yet , he would kill her before he had done , if he was hang 'd for it ; and if the People did not get out of his House , he 'd do them a Mischief . - It is not long since he hang 'd the Deceas 'd , and if some Neighbours had not come in and cut her down , she had dy 'd then . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . My Wife was drunk , and fell off of Mrs. Palmer 's Steps and so she got her Death , and I have Witnesses to prove it . Martha Carter .

I saw him and his Wife going home at past ten at Night , and she fell down twice . Court . Did not he push her down ? E. Janeway . Not that I saw . She wanted the Key of him , but he assisted that he was going a little way , and would not give it her ; but at last I got them home , and she hit him a Slap o'the Face , and spit in his Face , and pull 'd him by the Breeches , and said , You Son of a Bitch , you want to go to your Whores , do you ? And at 11 a Clock I left 'em good Friends . Court . Tho ' she had spit in his Face , and given him such gross Language ! but what Night was this ? E. Janeway . It was a Tuesday Night . Court . Why the poor Woman lay a dying then . Sarah Wagstass . I was in Nicholas Court on Monday Night , from 12 till past 1 , and I saw no Blow given her in all that time , nor so much as an Offer to strike her . Court . But a great many Witnesses have given a very different Account . The Jury found him Guilty Death . 74.

He was a 2d time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . John Brown . There was a Disturbance in the Tower , occasion 'd by the Prisoner 's Wife abusing another Woman , for which I had Orders from Captain Hudson , the Officer of the Guards , to turn her out of the Garrison . I went accordingly to the Barrack where she was , about 9 at Night ; the Prisoner was then a-bed . I told her she must turn out ; upon which she said , Jo , will you see me turn 'd out ? No , says he , and starts up an-end . I have no difference with you Jo , says I . No matter for that , says he , you sha n't turn her out , and immediately he catch 'd up his Piece and presented . I went to take hold of his Piece ; but says he , Take care ! if you stir a Foot , you 're a dead Man . Robin Bugheard , who was 3 or 4 Yards behind me , said , Brown , do n't be too ventersome . So I step 'd back , and went to the Officer of the Guard , and acquainted him that the Prisoner stood with his Piece presented , and did not know what he meant by it . The Captain upon that , said to the Deceas 'd , who was a Corporal but did Sergeant 's Duty , Aaair-take three or four Men , and bring him to me Prisoner . I was at the Barrack-door , when the Deceas 'd with 4 Men behind him came in , and when he was got within 6 or 7 Yards of the Prisoner , the Prisoner said , Take care of your self Bob . He had no sooner spoke than his Piece went off , and the Deceas 'd drop 'd down , and said , Lord have Mercy upon me ! I took him up , but he was dead . Mean time , the other four secur 'd the Prisoner - No Body had a Gun there but he . I run directly up to the Officer , and told him what had happen 'd , and he order 'd me to take the Prisoner to the Black-hole , - when came to fetch him , I found his Ram-tod under his bed . Eleanor Duckworth . The Prisoner put his Ram-rod into his Piece , and he said , he would be the Death of Sergeant Brown , but this was when Sergeant Brown was gone ; and when the Deceas 'd came in , I saw the Prisoner fire his Piece , and I fell down , and ha n't felt my Child stir since . Robert Bugheard . The Prisoner presented his Piece to Brown . I advis 'd Brown to come up . I went towards the Prisoner , and he said to me , as he said before to Brown , If you come a step farther , you 're a dead Man . Why do you take such wicked thoughts in your Head , says I , against those that never hurt you ? And his answer was , I am resolv 'd to do Mischief , if I go to Hell the next Minute . Then the Deceas 'd came in , and before he spoke a Word to the Prisoner , the Prisoner cry 'd , Take care Bob ! and his Piece went off slamm ! The Deceas 'd fell , the Prisoner sat himself down on the Bed , and laid his Piece by him , and I took it up , and saw it was Discharg 'd . Charles Feasant , and Jonathan Wates . We were 2 of the 4 that seiz 'd the Prisoner . He was ask 'd , If he was not sorry ? and he said , He was sorry it fell on the Man it did ; but he wish 'd it had been Sergeant Brown . And when he heard the Man was dead , he said , Let him dye and be damn 'd . The Captain came in , and ask 'd who kill 'd the Man , and the Prisoner said , I did it . Prisoner . Brown , and my Dame , and this Woman , had some words , and when I was a sleep . Brown came and waked me , and said , Get up , and turn your Wife out of the Barracks , or I 'll kick her out . I begg 'd him not , and told him , it would be Folly and a Sin to do it ; but he went out to fetch 2 File of Musketeers , upon which I catch 'd up a Piece , and just as the Deceas 'd came in , it fell out of my Hand , and went off . Court . Tho ' you said , Have a care , Bob ! just as , it went off , and afterwards wish 'd it had been Brown . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 75.
