Mary Hendron , John Wheeler , and Margaret Pendergrass , were indicted upon a Statute of the 3d of Harry the VIIth , for aiding and abetting Richard Russel , in forcibly and unlawfully marrying and defiling Sibble Morris ; against her Will , on the 5th of March last , the said Sibble Morris being a Maiden , and having an Estate . Anne Holliday , Servant to Mrs. Morris , depos 'd , That Mrs. Hendron asked her to bring her young Mistress to see her in Feb. last , and that upon her Intercession they went , that she prevail 'd with them to go with her to Mrs. Pendergrass 's , where they saw Richard Russel , but nothing extraordinary happened at that Time ; however , Mrs. Henderon endeavour 'd to make them have a good Opinion of Russel , saying , he was a rich Merchant in the City , that dealt in Oyls , Silks , and other Goods of Value . After this , she prevail 'd with them to come a second Time , and going towards Hendron 's House , they met one Peggy Johnson , and one Kitty Pendergrass , the Daughter of Pendergrass the Prisoner , who told them that Mrs. Hendron was not at home , but wanted to see them , and desired they would come to her at a House in New Round Court , in the Strand . Mrs. Morris was against going there , but she and the Maid were both pull 'd along by Peggy Johnson and Kitty Pendergrass , to the House of one Murphew in Round Court ; that Mrs. Hendron , and Margaret Pendergrass the Prisoners , stood at the Door , and obliged them to come in , pulling Miss Morris through a long dark Entry into a Room where the Windows were shut up with Shutters , and there were Candles and a great deal of Company . Mrs. Morris being surpriz 'd at this , would have turned back , but was hindred by Hendron who lock 'd the Door upon her and the Maid , and upon their saying they would cry out , she said that would signify nothing , for no Body could hear them . Immediately Russel came up to Mrs. Morris , and asked her to tell her Christian Name , which she refused , and was in a great surprize and Fright ; that a Person in the Habit and Appearance of a Clergyman being there , came up to them , when Hendron and a Person who officiated as Clerk , forcibly held her up , she being ready to faint , and the Person began the Ceremony , but Mrs. Morris did not answer to the Questions put to her , she only said she would not be married : However , he proceeded in the Ceremony , and Hendron and Pendergrass said , she did answer , that she came there to be married , and that she was only Faint-hearted , tho ' all this Time she was in the utmost Confusion , and even lost the Power of Speech and Strength to support herself under such Usage . After this Mock-Marriage , Hendron and others dragg 'd her up Stairs to a Bed-Chamber , which was also shut up with Shutters , and Kitty Pendergrass and Peggy Johnson , pulled off her Cloaths by Force , Hendron holding her Hands ; and that one Mrs. Rigy was there present while all this was done , that they forc 'd her into Bed , and that Hendron held her down in Bed , and commanded this Deponent to go down Stairs , which she was obliged to do , tho ' she complained that it was a Shame they should use her Mistress so ; that upon the Stairs she met Russel undress 'd , and upon his going into the Room , Hendron lock 'd the Door and came down , leaving them together ; after this the Prisoners and others for about Half an Hour were very merry , till Mrs. Morris and Russell came down Stairs ; that they would have had Mrs. Morris to have eat some Supper with them , but she refused it , and would go home that Russell went Part of the Way with them . She being cross-examined as to Margaret Pendergrass , this Deponent said , She was at the Door of the House with Mrs. Hendron , when Mrs. Morris was drag 'd through the Entry , and that she was in the Room all the while where the pretended Marriage was ; that she told Mrs. Morris she must be married to Russell ; it would be to her Advantage that she consented to , and commended what was done , that she came up Stairs into the Room while her Daughter Kitty Pendergrass assisted in forcing off the Cloaths of Mrs. Morris , that the Door was unlock 'd to let her in , that she staid there a little while , and then went down into the Room where the Supper was . This Deponent , being ask 'd , if she did not take the Measure of her Mistress Finger , in Order to have a Ring made to it , which Measure she brought to Hendron 's House , she said , she did not take the Measure of her Mistress 's Finger ; but upon some Proof of her bringing some Measure to Mrs. Hendron 's House , she confess 'd she brought a Measure to Hendron 's House , as the Measure of her Mistress 's Finger , but it was without her Mistress 's Knowledge , and that having once mention 'd such a Thing to her , she would not suffer it ; that Hendron by her Insinuations having made her believe that her Mistress 's Marriage would be much to her Advantage , she was betray 'd to that Indiscretion . As to Wheeler , she said he was not in the Room at the Marriage , nor did he appear when any of the Violencies were acted , but only at Supper with the rest of the Company . Mrs. Sibble Morris confirm 'd the Particulars of her Maid 's Deposition , with regard to the forcible Marriage , and forcing her to Bed , that Hendron was the chief Actor , that she was held up in the Time of the Ceremony , did not answer to the Matrimonial Responses , was dragg 'd up to the Bed-Chamber , forced into Bed against her Will and Consent , that Richard Russell had Carnal Knowledge of her Body , and had given her the foul Distemper , making an Advantage of her Surprize and Weakness , and tho ' she resisted to the utmost of her Strength , he held her down in Bed and overcame her , and when she cried out , stopt her Mouth , that Pendergrass was present at the Marriage , was in the Room a little while where they were forcing off her Cloaths , and assisted and persuaded to the Marriage , and consented to all that was acted , but did not remember that Wheeler was in the Room or at the Marriage , or in the Bed-Chamber , or was privy to any Violence . Mr. Allen depos 'd , That he was the Person who officiated as Clerk and that he provided the Parson by the Persuasion and Importunity of Wheeler , who had been with him four or five Times before he would consent to have any Thing to do with it , but Wheeler told him it was to marry a Gentleman to a Servant Maid , with whom he had fallen in love , and to that End he appointed to meet him and the Parson ( whose Name is Evans , a Parson at the Fleet ) at the seven Stars in Cross-street , Long-Acre , where they met , and from thence went to the House of one Murphew in New . Round Court in the Strand , where this Deponent said , Russell and his Accomplices were met together ; and that when they went to perform the Ceremony Mrs. Morris trembled , and he could not perceive that she gave her Consent , but on the contrary refused it ; upon which he told the Parson he might shut up his Books , for they were not like to make a Wedding of it , but some of the Company saying , she answered to the Questions put to her , the Parson went through the Form of Matrimony , that Pendergrass , the Prisoner , affirmed she spoke , and that she came to be married , and was only Faint-hearted , tho ' this Deponent said , for his own Part , he heard her say , she would not be married , yet the Parson went on with the Ceremony , and after the Ceremony was concluded they left them . Jonathan Daniel depos 'd , That Wheeler , the Parson and Clerk , came to his House at the 7 Stars in Cross-street , Long-Acre , and went up Stairs , and by some Passages he did believe there was something going forward which was not fair , and that soon after they were gone Margaret Pendergrass the Prisoner , came to his House and enquired for such People , and upon his saying they were gone , she stamp 'd with her Foot , and said she had rather have given five Pounds than be disappointed . Mr. Morris ( the Father of the injur 'd Gentlewoman ) depos 'd , That she had an Estate , which was at present 20 Pounds per Annum clear to her ( and would be more ) in Southampton-street , Covent-Garden , which Estate was left her by a deceas 'd Uncle ; he farther said , That this pretended Marriage being on the Tuesday , on the Thursday following a Gentleman pretending to be a Friend to Russel , came and acquainted him of his Daughter 's Marriage , ( which Gentleman afrerwards appear 'd in Court , and depos 'd he was sent by Margaret Pendergrass , as Russells Friend ) that he being surpriz 'd at this , went immediately to his Daughter and ask 'd her about it ; to which she answered , she had been vilely impos 'd on and barbarously used under the Pretence of a Marriage , but for Fear and Shame she had not acquainted him with it ( she being a young Girl between 16 and 17 Years of Age . ) That Russell came to him on the Saturday , but he would not have any Conversation with him , and that since he is absconded . Mary Hendron , and Margaret Pendergrass , were found Guilty . Death . And as Wheeler was employed by Margaret Pendergrass to get a Parson , and might be imposed on by her , as it did not appear that he was privy to any Force at the Marriage or otherwise , he was acquitted .
