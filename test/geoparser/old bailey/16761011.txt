A true NARRATIVE Of the Proceedings at the Sessions-house IN THE OLD-BAYLY , At a Sessions of Peace there held ; Which began on Wednesday the 11th of this Instant October , and ended on Fryday the 13th , 1676 . Setting forth the several Facts , Tryals , and Condemnation Of Sixteen persons sentenced to Die . Amongst whom was one for killing a man neer Islington almost two years ago . With an Account how many are Burn 'd in the Hand and to be Whipt . With Allowance . LONDON : Printed for D.M . 1676 . The present Sessions was so unhappily fruitful in discoveries of variety of Villainy , that the copiousness of the matter may justly ease us of a tedious Preamble , that common lumber of a Pamphlet , and oblige us , unless we had more room than a single sheet , forthwith to fall to the Relation of particulars . A young fellow was indicted , for that he with two others , not yet known or taken , came into a shop in Cheapside and stole two silver Watches and a Watch-case to the value of Ten pound . The master of the shop was a Watchmaker , but his wife on one side of it kept the trade of a Millineress : He being abroad , and none but she in the whole shop , the Prisoner and another came in pretending to buy Gloves , and holding the Gentlewoman in discourse , and crowding up to the wall , on a sudden a Boy in the street ( supposed to be one of their Comrogues , and to be done by Confederacy ) snatches two Watches off from the Grate , and a Case , and run away : he that was with the Prisoner pretended to strike at him , and run after him so far , that he never came back ; and the Prisoner would have been going too , but was seiz 'd . However , since there was no proof of the boy that stole the Watch being of his Company , he was brought in not Guilty . One indicted for breaking open a house the 22th of September , in the day time . He got into a Tavern in Cornhil , and went into the upper Rooms , where he broke open a door and stole a Perriwig , Stockings , and several other things ; but being afraid of a discovery as he came down , endeavour 'd to escape at the top of the house ; but being seen by a Neighbour on the Leads , and examined , he first said he was surveying the house , afterwards that he had a Master below a drinking ; but in short , was apprehended , committed , and now found guilty , having , as was testified in the Court , been burn 'd in the hand before . Two old Offenders having two Indictments against them both for felonious taking the Goods of two Gentlemen , pleaded guilty to those and all others within the benefit of Clergy , a knack of Law which the Newgate-students are generally well vers 'd in , though here 't is like to do them but small kindness ; for though the respective Indictments to which they pleaded guilty , were but for Felony , as being laid in London , where the Goods ( being Plate and Linnen , to a very great value ) were taken with them , yet upon Examination of Evidence both Facts appeared to be Burglaries in other Counties , viz . one in Wiltshire , and the other in Bark-shire ; and in such a Case the advantage of Clergy is expressly excluded by the Statute : So that they are both like to suffer deservedly for their wicked practices , which was to take their progress to remote parts in the Country , and take the advantage of breaking open the houses of persons of Quality , where they might have the most considerable Booty , being well provided with all sorts of Betties , Mills , and other Hellish Engines for effecting the same . A Man was tryed on an Indictment for Murther , for killing one William Parker on the 8th day of February last was Twelvemonth , near Islington : the Case was thus ; The said Parker and another , now an Evidence , were at work a ditching ; the Prisoner and his Brother ( not yet taken ) came that way , but out of any common Path , with each of them a very great Stake in his hand , which seemed lately to be pluckt out of some Fence . Parker ( knowing them ) told them , they did not do well to spoil Peoples Pastures and Fences , & c. Whereupon they swore they would beat out his Brains , and assaulted the Ditchers , who defended themselves as well as they could a while ; and then coming to a Parley , the Prisoner and his Brother went away above threescore yards , and then on a suddain returned , swearing they would kill the old Rogue ( meaning the said Will . Parker ) and then the Prisoner , with the Club or Stake he had in his hand , gave the said Parker a mortal bruise on the right side of the Head , so that he lay at present for dead , but with Spirits was brought to life again ; but next Morning about four a Clock died . Whilst the Evidence was getting Strong waters to revive his Friend and call for help , the Criminals fled , nor could be heard of for above this year and an half upon the Hue and Cry , till lately the Prisoner was taken near Croyden in Surrey . Though on the Evidence it seemed to be a Murther , yet on consideration of the whole matter , the Jury brought it in only Manslaughter , for reasons best known to themselves ; but craving the benefit of his Clergy he was not able to read , and so received sentence of Death . Two fellows were found guilty of breaking open a house at Edmonton in the day time on the 30th of August last , and felonious taking of six pair of Sheets , a Farrindon gown , and other Linnen and Apparel , no body being in the same house , but the bar of the window being broke , and the Thieves seen with bundles coming from the house , they were pursued so closely that they dropt their Pillage into a Garden and hid themselves , one in a Ditch of water , the other in Bushes , but were soon taken , and some odde things , as a Razor , & c. taken about one of them , but they were seen to drop the rest that were left in the Garden , and therefore there was no need of further proof . The next Case of two Criminals had more of Intricacy in it : They broke open an uninhabited house at Hackney , and took thence a Copper valued at Four pound ; but not being able the same night to carry it off , hid it three or four fields distant , where it was accidentally found by honest Neighbours , and a Watch planted next night to see who would fetch it away , who appeared to be the Prisoners now at the Bar ; and after they had carried it some few rods , the Ambuscade unwilling they should weary themselves too much , came in to prevent their further toil , and lodged them safe next day in Newgate . It was agreed that the first taking the Copper , being fixed by Morter , & c. to the Freehold , was onely a Trespass , and no Felony ; but it was resolved , that the second remove after it was once separated , was Felony , the property not being altered ; and thereupon they were found guilty by the Jury . These two had long made a Trade of Stealing , and formerly received mercy , but would take no warning . There was a woman indicted for having two Husbands , and a man for as many Wives : she was prosecuted by her latter ( supposed ) Husband , he by his former Wife ; but for want of direct and sufficient proof , neither were found guilty . The man seemed very passionately desirous , that Squire Katch might sue out a Divorce between him and his Lady ; and yet it is certain ( unless he publickly belyed himself in Court ) he has got something by her since their Marriage . The next was a little confident ungrateful Slut , taken up in the streets by an honest laborious Market-woman , who first employed her , and afterwards admitted her to lie with her : she took an advantage one morning when her kinde Dame was gone out early , leaving her in bed , to rob the poor woman of almost all the clothes she had , sending them away by some Confederates , and devoutly forswearing her own knowing any thing of the matter ; but finding a Warrant like to come , fled , and was found with an Ends of Gold and Silver woman , to whom she had pawn 'd part of the things : she was Convicted only to the value of ten Pence ; and consequently instead of riding in a Cart , shall only have the honour to follow it , under the correction of a gentle Lash . Another like Example of base Ingratitude from Shadwel . A man in kindness gives a young Fellow his Lodging ; who in requital gets up early , and runs away with a small Trunk , and 9l . 15s . in Money , besides Rings and other things in it , to his almost utter undoing , having been two years searching for the Thief ; for so I may lawfully call him , standing convicted by the Verdict of Twelve men , being lately arrived from a voyage to Sea . One was indicted for stealing a dunnish Gelding , a brown Nagg , and one black Mare . The Evidence was such that he could hardly deny it , onely endeavoured to evade it by alleadging that he had no felonious intent . Being convicted , he beg 'd hard for Transportation , but received Sentence with the rest to die . A Woman that had several times troubled the Court at former Sessions , was now brought in again ; the Crime she was charged with being thus : She had for some time lodged at a house in St. Sepulchres Parish , and on the 22th February last taking an opportunity , whilst her Landlord and his Wife were gone forth to a Funeral , cut away the posts of the door where they used to lie , and with a piece of Iron put back the Spring-lock , and stole away a silver Cup to the value of 5l . a Tankard worth 9l . and several other Goods , wearing Apparel , & c. There came in Evidence against her , that they saw a light in the Chamber where the Robbery was committed at the same time , and Knock 'd at the door , but no body would answer ; and that immediately after she was seen to come out of the house with a bundle or a heap in her Apron , & c. After Conviction she pleaded her Belly , but a Jury of Matrons gave in their Verdict that she was not with Childe . Two other notorious Female Offenders received Sentence for stealing a considerable parcel of Linnen and other things : One of them , it was said , had formerly been transported , which she begg 'd for heartily now again , but notwithstanding their prayers , both were tied up . The rest of the men whose Crimes are not particularized , were condemned for Burglaries , wherein there was nothing extraordinary , save the prodigious suffered , seem 'd to live as beasts of Prey upon the destruction of their peaceable and industrious Fellow-subjects . There were in all Sixteen persons ( Thirteen men and Three women ) that received Sentence of death , Thirteen burn 'd in the hand , and Five women ordered to be Whipt at the Carts tail , or ( as themselves phrase it ) To shove the Flogging Tumbler .
