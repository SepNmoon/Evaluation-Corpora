I sent for him , and he told me , she had not liv 'd any where in Town , but if he was worth a thousand Pounds he would give that Security for her honesty ; I told him , our Service required a trusty Servant ; but as you are an honest Neighbour , I believe I may depend upon you ; so upon his Character I took her . She had not lived with me above a Week , but I miss 'd a pair of double Ruffles , which cost me 7 l. I desir 'd Mr. Daffey to part with her , for I was sure she was a Pilferer ; he said , we could not do without a Servant , and we must therefore watch her . I believe she had convey 'd away most of the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment before ; she took away ( for ought I know ) Things to the value of 200 l. Mr. Bird .

Mrs. Acton I was at Mr. Daffey 's the Night that Williams was sent for , and I told him , he had not done well to recommend a Thief : he said he thought she had been honest , and blam 'd Mary Hughes for behaving so wrong : They whisper 'd together , but he said not a Word then , of the Boxes which were at his House , nor did we know there were any things at his House , 'till the next Day . The next Morning he came and told us there were Boxes at his House , but Mary 's Sister had gutted them by 3 o'Clock in the Morning ; when Grace was taken up , she own 'd she had taken the Goods out of the Boxes ; and that a young Man in the Neighbourhood assisted her to carry them to Duke's-Place : They were brought back by Grace Hughes , Williams and his Wife , and were found to be Mr. Daffey 's Goods . Mrs. Rutter .

The Prisoner Williams recommended her to me , as an honest Body , a Country Woman of his , and newly come to Town from Chester . I believed Williams to be an honest Man , and took her on his Character . I presently found she knew the Town as well as I , and that she was a saucy impudent Woman . I lost some things while she lived with me , but as I could not swear any Fact upon her , and she threatned me with the Law if I charged her ; I was cautious , and only turn 'd her away ; she liv 'd with me about 5 Weeks . John Rutter . I was at Mr. Daffey 's that Evening the Constable was carrying Mary Hughes away ; Williams was sent for , and he said he would meet them at Sir William 's , but said not a word of any Goods at his House . The next Morning he said , he was sorry for what had happen 'd , and told us there were 2 Boxes and a Trunk at his House , which were sent for to Mr. Daffey 's , but they were stripp 'd ; Grace , he said , had carry 'd off the things in the Night ; but he would go to Rosemary-Lane where she had lodged some other Boxes and enquire after them . Nathan Smith .

Grimes led me about 100 Yards out of the way , took my Things , rifled me , and then ty 'd my Hands and my Legs together with my own Garters : They left me sitting within a Yard and a half of the Pond , by the Wilderness , and told me , they would either release me in a Quarter of an Hour , or bring me more Company . When they were gone , I got up with some Difficulty , and jumped along to the Keeper 's House , where I was unty 'd . I do n't know how the Discovery was made of the Prisoner : I suppose the Robbery being put in the Papers occasion 'd it : They sent for me when Grimes and the Prisoner were before the Justice , and I was order 'd to prosecute the Prisoner . I ca n't swear to the Prisoner ; he kept always behind me . Grimes . otherwise Graham . The Prisoner had been a Gentleman 's Servant ; my Circumstances he knew were low , and therefore he from Time to Time endeavoured to seduce me to these Courses : He perswaded me to go out with him 3 or 4 nights together , but we had no manner of Success in our Way . Thursday , Friday , Saturday , and Sunday we took nothing but on Monday Night we went round Hyde-Park Corner , and met nothing that would do : Come , says he , let us go down Constitution-Hill , perhaps we may make something there . I went with him , and there we met this young Man , and took from him the Things mentioned , ty 'd up in a Handkerchief , and ty 'd his Hands and Feet : The Seals , I believe , were lost ; the Buckles I know nothing of ; but as to the Knives , one of them is in Court , the other is at the Justice 's . It was I who took hold of the Prosecutor ; the Prisoner had a Pistol . I had only a Stick ; he kept behind in order I suppose , to conceal himself . He bid me attack the Man ; I did , and giving him a Stroke in the Mouth with my Stick , for fear he should be Rusty , I made him come out of the Road towards the Pond . George Stringer . The Accomplice Grimes told me , it was the Prisoner who was at the Door , when another Man brought the Coat and Wastcoat to me to pawn . I lent 4 s. upon them , about 9 o'Clock at Night , the 16th of February . I ca n't swear to the Prisoner ; but it was such a sort of a Man , and about his Size . Grimes The Prisoner carry 'd them to pawn the very Night we took them : Upon my Oath he was the Man , and I had 2 Shillings of the Money . Constable . Last Friday Grimes came to my House , and told me , he desired to go before a Justice , to make himself an Evidence ; but stay a little , says he , and the Man will come whom you are to take . Accordingly the Prisoner came and enquired for Grimes ; he immediately charged me with him , and before Justice Mitford , he made his Information of this Robbery . When Grimes charged me with him , he seem 'd surpriz 'd ; and cry 'd O Mr. Grimes . I did not think you would have serv 'd me so ! we search 'd the Prisoner , and found some Things upon him , which are at the Justices , and this Knife was taken out of his Pocket . Robert Fish . I was present when this Knife and some Gun Powder and some Flints were taken out of his Pockets ; he desired us to let him go , and cry 'd , O Mr. Grimes ! have you brought me to this at last ! Alexander Graham . I can only prove the Prisoner and Grimes to have been acquainted ; they lay together 3 Nights , about a Fortnight ago . I keep a Publick Shop . Q . You sell a Dram , I suppose . Graham . Yes , my Lord , I sell a Dram of Gin , and the like . Prisoner 's Defence . I would ask , whether Grimes has not been supplied with Money in New-Prison ; and whether he has not had Money given him to swear my Life away ? Constable . Grimes told me in New-Prison he was starving , and I lent him 2 s. that 's all the Matter . Mary Morgan . I am a Laundress . and live by Golden-square ; I came here on the Prisoner 's behalf On last Monday Se'nnight I got the Prisoner to write me out a Bill for Washing , he did , and I desired him to come to Supper with me : He came about 6 o'Clock that Night , and staid with me till almost 10 . Q . How came you to know it was Monday Se'nnight ? Morgan . I know it was that Day , because I wanted the Bill to be wrote out . Q . Whose Bill was that ? Morgan . One Mr Sale 's . Q . Was there a Date to that Bill ? Morgan . Yes , the Day of the Month was to it . Q . Can you produce that Bill ? Morgan . No . Q . 'T is a little unlucky ; because if Mr. Sale had been a Person of Reputation , this Circumstance would have been of Weight . - Pray where do you live ? Morgan . At Mr. Humphrey 's , a Cheesemonger , in the Garret , as high as I can go . Q . So the Prisoner was with you in the Garret from 6 to 10 . Pray does any of Mr. Humphrey 's People know any Thing of his being there ? Morgan . I do n't know that ; there is an Entry , when the Shop is shut up for the Lodgers to go in and out through : When a House is full of Lodgers , they seldom take notice who comes to and fro . Q . Is Mr. Humphreys here ? Morgan . No , if he was here , he could not but give me a very good Character . I washed the Prisoner 's Linnen , when he served the Lord Southwell ; and we went over to Holland , when his Lady went with the Princess of Orange ; but as the Place did not agree with his Constitution , he came back to England . Another Woman . I am with Child , and speak nothing but Truth : This young Man at the Bar , was in this Gentlewoman 's Room from 6 to 10 . I lived with her , and know it was that Monday Night ; I provided the Supper , and I am sure of it . I am with Child at this Instant of time . - Anderson . I lived with my Lord Southwell , when the Prisoner was my Fellow Servant . He behaved very honestly , and when he returned from Holland , my Lord gave him a Character to two Places . Luttwich . I happened to be at Goodhall 's ( the Constable ) at Dinner , when Grimes came in : He said he would go into a Back Room , and smoke a Pipe : In a very little time the Prisoner came and enquired for him , and Graimes called him out into the Entry . Grimes . I was in Mr. Goodhall 's Parlour ; when one came and told me the Prisoner enquir 'd for me : I went to him and wink 'd at the Person that call 'd me , to go back and call Mr. Good-hall , that I might charge him : Then I went into a Room , and left the Prisoner in another ; he followed me , but I took up my Pint and my Glass , and went into another , and I never went out to him afterwards . Constable . Grimes was called out of the Room , when the Prisoner came to ask for him ; then they went into another Back Room , and presently Grimes sent for me , and charged me with him . Robert Fish . Luttwich said to the Prisoner , you Rascal , have not I told you often , not to frequent such Company ; and he desired him not to mention the Powder nor Flints . You Villain , says he to the Prisoner , have not I desired you to go with me to Chapel and hear Mass , and warned you against such Company ? Luttwich . I did meet the Prisoner about a Fortnight ago , and would have had him gone with me to serve God , and not have gone to a Beer-house . I do n't know , whether he said any Thing about the Flints and the Powder . One of the Jury Men desired Mr. Morgan and the other Woman might be asked a Question or two apart ; one of them was ordered to withdraw . Q. T , Morpan .

I was not out at all ; I was at Home all Day , and all Night ; my Partner was out some part of the Day , but she came Home about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon . Q . What Time did the Prisoner come in ? Woman . About 6 , and went away at 10 . Q . How did you pass the Time ? Woman In a very good Manner ; I was at my Plain Work , and he was reading a good Book . Q . Did you drink any Thing ? Woman .

I serve Mr. Nesbit , and had laid the Cloath in the Parlour according to Custom . There were on the Table 4 Salts , four/Salt-Shovels and four Spoons . I shut the Parlour Door , and went down to dress myself then I went into the Parlour again , to mend the Fire , and seeing the Entry dirty , as if somebody had been there , I went down to the Cook , and asked her , if any body had been in the Parlour ; she said no : I went in again for something for my Mistress , and found the Salts , the Spoons , and the Salt-shovels were gone . I called the House-keeper , a we look 'd into the Buffet , but nothing was taken from thence , nothing but the Plate that was upon the Table . We sent for the Silversmith who made the Plate , and advertised it ; but before the Advertisement came to his Hands , the Spoon mentioned in the Indictment , was brought to his Shop , and he stopt it . Archibald Gilchrist . After Mr. Nesbit had lost the Things , he sent for me , and I caused Advertisements to be printed , and left at the Goldsmith 's . I offered two Guineas Reward and no Questions ask 'd : About 7 o'Clock as the Man who gave out the Bills , was putting one into my Hand , Mr. Newsome came , and told me , he had stopt one of the Spoons , and said he believed he could help us to take the Person that brought it to him . Mrs. Newsome . The Prisoner at the Bar brought this Spoon to me to be valued ; I asked him whose it was ; he said it was his own . I told him he must bring somebody to make that appear , before he should have it again , he then went away , and I saw him no more till he was taken up . Prisoner . I was drinking at Cow cross , and fell into Discourse with a Sea-faring Man : He pulled out a Pack of Cards ; I play 'd with him and won all his Money ; then he pulled off a Ring and would have me play against that : I did not think it was Gold , so I refused ; then he pulled out the Spoon , and desired me to lend him Money upon it ; I lent him 10s upon it , and won the Money of him again ; he said the Spoon was worth 14s . and wanted more Money , I would lend no more till I knew the Value : why then says he , as you live but over the way ; I will entrust you with it , go , and see what 't is worth : I carried it , to this Gentlewoman , and she stopt it . I told her , Madam , I am at present the Owner of the Spoon , but I will go and fetch the Man I had it of , in a Quarter of an Hour : I went back to the Alehouse to look for him , but he was gone . I never absconded but was taken at my own Door . Gilchrist . We were told by this Gentlewoman , that she had seen the Prisoner go by her Shop with a Woman she had some Knowledge of , and as we were talking about this Affair , a Grubber , one who sweeps the Streets , heard us , and said , if you are talking of Newgate Nan , or Pin Nan , you may find her at a Brandy-shop at Cow-Cross ; so we went to Cow-Cross , and enquired for New-gate Nan , or Pin Nan ; but the People told us , if we wanted her , it was not for any Thing that was good , and refused to let us know where she was . At last we found out the Grubber , and he said , when we described the Prisoner , he knew him well ; a little tidy Fellow , who would spend 4 or 5 Guineas at Cards : The Constable said he had some Knowledge of him , so he got a Warrant and went to look for him , and saw him standing at a Door ; I charged the Constable with him , and asked him if he did not know Newgate Nan , or Pin Nan ; he said he did not , we carried him to an Alehouse , and presently Newgate Nan came in and asked for him , and said he was her Husband . I went to get the Warrant back 'd , and they staid at an Alehouse till I came back , and till I could get a City Constable ; then I brought them word to march ; and while I was gone , they had drank half a Crown 's worth of Liquor ; I paid for it , and ordered them to march : G - d D - m your Blood , says Newgate Nan , he shall not sir , till you give me half a Crown 's worth more . I went to Newgate , and gave him a Dram to persuade him to tell us where the rest of the Plate was ; he said he would return it ; say no more says he , a Word to the Wise is enough . Benjamin Barret . I keep a Brandyshop , and sell Gin , and the Prisoner has frequented my House four or five months , I know him to be an honest , sober , civil Man ; I never saw him drunk above two or three times in my shop . Anne Chalkley . I live right against Hicks's-Hall , and am an Embroiderer . I have known the Prisoner to have followed sometimes Portering , sometimes Coal-heaving , and sometimes carrying a Basket in Newgate-market for his Living ; he came home from Sea about 7 Months ago , and I ca n't deny but that I have heard a Talk of his having been transported , but I can not say any thing to it . Prisoner . I should have been glad if the Man I won the Spoon of had been here . Q. Aye ; is it not odd , that the Person you won it of should not appear ? Mrs. Newsome . If he won the Spoon at Cards , he made quick Work of it , for the Spoon was lost about One o'Clock , and he brought it to me before Two . The Jury found him Guilty 4s . 10d . And the Prisoner told the Court they had not done him Justice . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 42.

'T is Mrs. Evans at the end of the Alley . I had a suspicion of them , but I weigh 'd it , and told them it came to 4 l. 18 s. 9 d. Evans said if it came to no more she should lose Money by it , for she had lent 7 l. on it . I advised her to acquaint the Person she had it of , that it was worth no more ; and so they went away . About an Hour afterward , Parker came and asked me if that was the most I would give for it . I told her , it was as much as it came to , at 5 s. an Ounce . Well , says she , Mrs. Evans has try 'd , and she ca n't get more , so she desires you to send the Money for it . No . I told her I did not care to meddle with it at all : Why , says she , you do n't think it stolen , do you ? you do n't hear me charge you , says I . As soon as she was gone . I search 'd my Warnings , and did not find the Pot advertis 'd But about out an Hour and a Half after , the Man brought a Notice of it : says I , the Pot was here about an Hour and half ago , a Neighbour of mine has got it to sell . I was telling another Neighbour this Master , and he say 'd he knew Silvester , and would tell him , and bring him to me . He did so , and I told him , if I had had his Warning a little sooner , I could have stop 'd the Pot . He was for having a Warrant to take them up , but I desired him to go and speak to them first . I went with him , and took Evans aside , and told her I had got a Customer , who wanted such a Thing ; she said it was too late , she had sold it to another for more , and to one too who had asked no Questions . He got a Warrant for them ; and Evans told us then that she had sold it to Mr. Green in the Minories I went thither , but he had it not : but at the next Shop , ( Mr. Boddy 's we found it .

Henry Willoughbey . The Goods mentioned in the Indictment were my Mother-in-law 's , Mrs. Gresswell . She has been confined to her Bed a great while , therefore could not attend here . The young Prisoner lodged at one Mrs. Grigson 's , who keeps a Chandler 's Shop , and she having a large Quantity of Candles , which she offered to Sale , the Officers of the Excise , suspecting them to have paid no Duty , seized them : They were found to belong to Mrs. Gresswell ; upon Enquiry , Grigson owned she had them of Yates the younger : He sted from his Lodging , out at a Back-Do or , but was taken afterwards in Farthing-Fields , Wap . ping , and before the Justice gave a very frivolous Account of the Fact . We then enquired after the Father ; he was employed as a private Watchman by Mrs Gresswell and others , beside the publick Watch , to look after their Houses . Mrs. Gresswell 's Cellar-Door had frequently been open 'd in the Night , and the Watch-man never gave them notice of it : He was asked the Reason of his giving no notice when the Cellar was open 'd , and he told us , he always shut it , and stuck it close with Clay , when it had been open 'd : There were some Candles found upon him which he would give no Account of , and therefore the Justice committed him . Elizabeth Grigson was call 'd next , but she did not appear . Allen Parsons . Now I am Apprentice to Mrs. Gresswell . We frequently found the Cellar Door open , tho ' they watch 'd for us . I saw 7 Dozen and odd Pounds which were taken by the Constable out of the House ; I know them to be my Mistress 's Candles , by the Colour , the length of the Cotton , and the drawing off . Young Yates confess 'd he sold them to Mrs. Grigson for 3 s. and a Dozen ; before Justice Martin , he said the Candles were brought to him by a Man on Tower-hill , but he could give no Account of him , but he own 'd his selling them to his Land-lady .

I have some of the Goods , taken upon the Old Gentleman ; and at the Place where the Young one lodged we found 71 Pounds conceal 'd in Paper . We found but 3 Candles on the old one . When Young Yates was carry 'd before the Justice , he said he had the Candles from one Stevens a Watchman belonging to the Custom-house , and that they were Perquisites belonging to his Place . Elizabeth Grigson was call 'd again , and appear 'd . Grigson . He lodg 'd in my House , ( the young one ) and he brought the Candles in , as Perquisites belonging to a Watchman of the Custom-house , and I received them as such . Yates , junior . I saw the Cellar Door open 'd one Night by a Coach Wheel , and I thought there was no need of disturbing them . How the Candles came into my Room , I can not tell . I found them under the Stairs , when I went to look for a bit of Wood to make a Fire . Yates , junior . I lodged in Grigson 's House , and was out of Business . She asked me one Time to go along with her a little Way ; I went with her to Tower-hill ; we met a Man , she took a Box from him , and said to me Dick carry the Box home for me . I did , and left her with the Man ; when she came home she bid me carry the Box up Stairs ; whereof I did , it was full of Candles , and I weigh 'd them . Elizabeth Holden . I was coming over Tower hill , I ca n't say for the Day of the Month , but it was about 5 in the Morning , and I met Yates the Younger : I asked him how he and his Father did ; he desired me to lend him a half-penny for a Dram : This Grigson was with him , and had a Box which she desired Yates to carry over the Hill for her , and she said she would give him 6d . He asked her whether he must carry it up , or leave it belows Stairs ; she said , carry it up . I do n't know what was in the Box , but I believe she keeps a very disorderly House . Constable . We found the major Part of the Candles done up in Dozens in Papers , some few in a Box . Justice Martin . When the Boy , and the Witness was before me , he continued in the same Story , that they had them of a Watch-man , belonging to the Custom-house , and that they were brought to him , to a Bulk upon Tower-Hill , and that he carried them to this Witness to sell for him . I asked him if he could find this Man , and he said he could not . Yates , jun . Mrs. Grigson bid me say such and such Words before the Justice ; whereof I being ignorant of any such Affair , did so . She hired me once when a Box came in , to carry a Letter and the Box to her Mother 's at St James 's ; whereof I did so , and her Mother when she had read the Letter , paid me 18s . Richard Farrow . I was with him when he carried the Box to St. James 's I was out of Work , and he asked me to go with him , and he received 18s . 6d . Yates , jun . And I paid it to her , and she paid me for my Trouble . She sold them out of her Shop at a half penny a piece . Elizabeth Holder .
