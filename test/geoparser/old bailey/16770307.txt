LONDON : Printed in the year 1676/7 . A true Narrative of the Proceedings at the Sessions in the Old Bayly , March the 7th 1676/7 . THough this Sessions was very considerable both for the numerousness of the Offenders , and heinousness of several of their Crimes , yet none rais 'd so much noise and discourse as that impudent Villany of Sadler & his Accomplices stealing the Mace , and other Ensignes of State , from the house of the Right Honourable the Lord High Chancellor of England . For which they were on Wednesday the 7th instant brought to tryal , and put upon a London-Jury ( where they were taken with most part of the things stolen ) but after a long discussion of the matter , the prudence of the Court ( which delights to do Justa Juste ) thought fit to refer them to a Tryal upon Indictments in Middlesex , which were ordered to be drawn up against them ; and whereof we shall by and by in course , give the Reader a satisfactory Account . In the mean time was one arraign 'd for stealing Four and twenty yards of black Cloath , who conscious of his Crime , and well tutor 'd in Newgate-Discipline of avoiding other Indictment , pleaded guilty to that and all others within benefit of Clergy . Another was found guilty of breaking open a Minister 's house in Black fryers on the 14th of February last , apprehended in the manner , or ( if you will have it in the Language of the Evidence ) Taken Napping whilst he was busie at his work . One for stealing a silver Tankard on the 1 of February , of the value of Six pounds ; and another for a Tankard valued at Four pound ; both found guilty : Their method being so dis-ingenious and vulgar , that 't is not worth relating . The two persons for stealing the Mace coming on again to their Tryal in London , the three principals Sadler , Johnson , and Renninger were indicted ; the two women before indicted together with them as accessaries , being now reserved to take a tryal by themselves . The debate of this Cause was very tedious ; but upon the whole matter the Evidence was thus : That a Burglary was committed in the house of the Right Honorable the Lord High Chancellor of England in great Queen-street , in the night between the sixth and seventh of February , and the Mace valued at One hundred pound , and two Purses richly embrodered and set with Pearls at Forty pound , stolen out of a Closet one pair of stairs towards the street , a pane of glass being taken out justunder the catch of the Casement , and so the Casement open 'd , which was the easier to be done by reason the Balcony reach 'd very neer to the said window . The same Wednesday morning two of the Prisoners S. and J. came to a house in Knight rider street , where they had lain three weeks by the name of Clarke and Trueman , had been gone a week or thereabouts ; and upon inquiry , finding the Room not lett , told the people they were come to lie there again : J. brought in a bundle under his coat , and that night only he lay there , but had a fire , and next day brought down a small quantity of silver Lace , as he said , to burn at the Kitchin-fire ; and borrowing a hammer to beat it in his Chamber , lock 'd his door and continued beating about three hours : Next morning his Companion came , bringing their other Crony , and that night they all three lay together : On the Friday they all went forth , but carried away the Key of the Closet : Their Landladies daughter going up to clean the Room , observes a great many Spangles of Gold , and about six small Pearls , which prompted her curiosity ( having before some suspitions ) with a Knife to open the Closet-door , where under a cloath she met with the Coronet on the top of the Mace , and part of the body of it ; the sight whereof strangely surprized her , and made her call up her Mother , telling her , they had got the King 's Crown : She is no less amazed , but desires a Neighbour to inquire what News there was abroad at the Coffee-house ; there he is told ofmy Lord Chancellor 's being robb 'd ; and then concluding this must be his Mace , honestly gives information ; whereupon several of my Lords servants , with Officers , plant themselves over the way . That night none of the three Prisoners came there , but a woman to enquire for them ( who since pretends to be Sadler 's wife ) she presently is secured , so likewise was Johnson , who came next morning ; and soon after Sadler coming also thither , spying a Croud about the door , strikes down a Lane towards the Waterside , where he is pursued , and after some small resistance , taken . The Closet is search 'd and besides most part of the Mace , some of the Purse , and several other pieces of Plate found : And upon search before Sir W. T. in Sadler 's Almanack was found a Note where Jane Bosse liv 'd in Shoe-lane , who being well known for a bad woman , his Worship sends an Officer with some of the servants thither : They found her in a Garret and Renninger with her . Carrying her away ; she was observ 'd to fling a piece of Gold , part of the Mace , into the bed , and upon stricter search in a pot of water they found two pieces more . This Renninger , though bred to the Tap , pretended to be a Working Goldsmith ; and 't was prov 'd that the Sunday before the Robbery committed , he was between four and five a clock in the morning with the other two walking to and fro in Queen-street , hawking as 't is thought for an opportunity to accomplish their designe . Sadler confess 'd the Robbery , and charg 'd Johnson ashis only Confederate therein and that he gave Renninger and the woman what they had : Johnson denied that , and would onely confess himself an accessary after the Fact ; but such was the clearness of the Evidence , that the Jury could do no less than finde them all three guilty both of the Robbery and Burglary . And further , S. and J. were also found guilty on another Indictment for Burglary , and stealing Plate and Goods out of a Gentleman s house in St. Martins in the Fields to a great value , part of which Plate was now found in the before-mentioned Closet . To give a brief Account of these Notorious Malefactors , the Reader may be informed , that Sadler was by trade a Brick maker , a fellow whose person may engage the pity of as many Ladies , as his famous Predecessor Duval , if he had but a smack of the Monsieur , without which all other Accomplishments are but slight and despicable : He has divers years followed these courses , several times found mercie on former Convictions , kept some while to impeach others of the Gang : He carried himself now very insolently , and was of so vainglorious an humour , that by their own Confession that morning they had done the mischief , he made one of his Companions bear the Mace on his shoulder , and the other one of the Purses before him bare , quite thorough Lincolns-Inne-fields , whilst he follow 'd in State , & c. Johnson was bred up a Coachharness-maker , was not so notorious , yet had been dabbling before : He seem 'd much concern'dfor his present condition , and just as the Jury proclaim 'd him guilty , fell down at the Bar in a Swoon , so terrible an apprehension it made upon his Spirit . To rob the King thus was a heinous and daring attempt ; but two other ventured higher , presumed to rob God himself , by committing a Burglary on Enfield-Church , and stealing thence a Surplice , a Tippet , a Green Carpet , some Plate , & c. One of them on his Arraignment pleaded guilty , and the other on a fair Tryal was prov 'd to . A Gentleman took a Tryal for killing one of his friends in Finch-lane on the 19th of Jan. last : Upon Evidence it appeared they had been both drinking hard , and a sudden Quarrel happen 'd without any grounds , so that both drew their Swords , whereby the man was unhappily slain upon the place ; but no malice being prov 'd or imagined between them , it was found only Manslaughter , and was burnt in the hand for the same . Another Gentleman likewise had the Clery ; for being in a Quarrel , he had unhappily killed an Irish Gentleman that interpre 'd to part them . A Fellow that had stolen a Sorrel Mare worth Five pound at Brenchly in Kent , and brought her to an Inne in Holborn , and there sold her for Thirty shillings . The Felony was plainly proved and though the Prisoner pretended he bought her at Guilford in Surrey , yet the contrary being evident , he was found guilty and received sentence of Death . Jane Bosse , an old notorious Offender , was convicted and condemned as an Accessary , after the Fact , to Sadler and his Confederates , part of the Mace being taken with her : The other arraigned with her on the same account , was acquitted . The rest were for the most part notorious Criminals , guilty of Burglary and Felony , & c. whose Facts are too tedious to relate . In short , there were in all Fifteen persons Condemned to die , viz . Nine men and Six weomen ; Fifteen Burnt in the hand , Two to be Transported , and Four to be Whipt .
