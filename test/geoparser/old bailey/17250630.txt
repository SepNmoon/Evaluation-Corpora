But on the 5th of May last , between five and six in the Morning , he ran away ; and I soon after found my Drawers broke open , and mist the Money , and his Father 's Bond .

She was a 2d time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the Murder of Rich . Bostock . Tho Ball thus deposed : I am the Watchman ; and as I was coming by the Prisoner 's Door between 11 and 12 at Night , I heard a sort of Jumbling : I answer 'd first with my Staff , and then by word of Mouth ; and so the Prisoner came to the Door , and desired me to see for her Husband at the Cock Alehouse ; tho ' I must needs say , that I never suspected that he was her Husband , for they lived an abominable Life together , and so I did not go to see for him ; but a little while after , when my Hour was fulfill 'd , I was going by the Door again , and there I saw the Deccased standing with the Door a-jar , and he desired me to light his Candle ; and while I was about it , the Prisoner came down Stars with no kind of thing upon her , but her Cap and her Smock ; for I just had a Glimpse of her , and she threw the Door against the Deceased , and the force of it beat him into the Street ; and so the Deceased went in and shut the Door , and afterwards there was a great Lumbering in the House , and I heard the Deceased cry , Lord ! Lord ! Lord ! Whereupon , I thought they were got to their old Trade of Quarrelling , and so I pass 'd on to my Stand ; and a little while after , I heard somebody call Watch ! Watch ! And upon that , I ran out and heard that the poor Man was departed ; but not being willing to go upon my own Head , I went and inform 'd the Constable about it , and desired his Instruction for keeping the Peace , and to Mr. Constable and I went to the Deceased 's House , and there was he a-lying upon the Floor , and he was stab 'd into the Body thro ' the Coat , Wastecoat , and Shirt , and the Blood lay guthing out upon the Floor under him ; but I do n't remember much Discourse about it . Nicholas Cooper thus deposed : As I came thro ' Dover Court , the Prisoner stood at her Door with a Candle in her Hand , and call 'd the Watch : But as soon as she saw me she said , Pray , Mr. Cooper , come in and help my Husband up . I stept into the Shop , and saw the Deceased lying upon the Floor , with nothing upon his Back but his Shirt . See there , says she , how he lies dead drunk . I went to lift him up , and found there was no Life in him . I do n't know whether he 's drunk or no , says I , but I am sure he 's dead . Lord ! What shall I do ? says she , I threw something at him , and I am afraid I have given him an unhappy Blow . - For God 's Sake call a Surgeon . 'T is too late now , says I , you had better call the Watch , or any of your Neighbours . And so I went and fetch 'd in some of the People thereabouts ; and then , upon removing the Deceased , we perceived a great Wound in his Left Side . Nathanael West thus deposed . I am Constable : It was just past One o'Clock in the Morning , when my Watchman told me there was a Man dead at the Pastry-Cook 's . I went and found the Prisoner sitting in a Chair in a melancholy Posture ; the Deceased sitting on the Floor at her Feet , with his Head leaning in her Lap . I quickly perveiv 'd he was stab 'd , and told her as much , but she said the knew nothing of it . About three or four Yards from him , I found his Coat , Wastecoat , Hat and Wig , and this sharp pointed Case-Knife : It was greasy , and I thought it look 'd a little tarnish 'd with Blood ; but when I rub 'd the Tarnish with my Finger , it would not come off . This is the Coat and Wastecoat , and here 's the Shirt . - You may perceive that they 're all bloody , and in the Left Side of each of 'em you may see the Holes where the Knife went thro ' . - Before this Accident , I have several times been call 'd off my Watch upon the Prisoner 's crying out Murder , when she and the Deceased have been a quarrelling . Swarton ( another Watchman ) thus deposed : I was upon Duty at my Stand , ( near the Deceased 's House ) having just been beating Eleven o'Clock ; and not long after , comes the Deceased and knocks at his own Door , and there he stood knocking for the Space of a considerable time ; but no-body open 'd the Door . Mythinks , Master Bostock , says I , they ca n't , choose but hear you . Hear me ! Yes , L - her , she hears me well enough , says he , but I 'll give it her by and by : And so at last a Gentlewoman that lodges in the House came down and let him in ; and so he went up and beat the Prisoner severely , as I suppose , for I heard her cry out Murder ! And then down he comes again . Doctor , says he , ( for so he always call 'd me ) I have given it her , to her Heart 's Content . The more Shame for you then , says I , to beat your Wife at such a rate . My Wife ! says he , D - her , a Bitch , she 's none of my Wife , and I 'll turn her a-drift to-morrow . So I left him for that time , and I was call 'd again afterwards , and found him lying in the Shop , and the Prisoner said , I am afraid my dear Creature is dead . - Dead ! Ay , says I , be 's murder 'd . Then he did it himself , says she . And this is all that I know of the Matter . Joseph Barker thus deposed : As I was a-bed with my Wife , I heard a great Jumbling below ; but it being usual betwixt the Deceased and the Prisoner , we did not mind it , and it was quickly over . Being afterwards call 'd up , I found the Deceased was stab 'd , and the Prisoner said he did it himself . Mr. Scot the Surgeon thus deposed : I open 'd the Breast and lower Belly of the Deceased . He received the Wound betwixt the 7th and 8th Ribs , counting from above downwards ; it pass 'd thro ' the Midriff and the Left Lobe of the Lungs to the Left Ventricle of the Heart , in which it terminated , and was the Cause of his Death . The Prisoner thus made her Defence . I had been at work late , and went to Bed very much tir 'd , and presently fell into a sound Sleep . The Deceased came up , and beat me in a violent and barbarous manner , pull 'd me out of Bed , tore all my Linnen off , and then went down Stairs . He had served me so several times before , and I always used to humour him , by going down after him , and giving him good Words to coax him to Bed again ; tho ' indeed I was never married to him . Now I suppose that I not coming to fetch him up so soon as he expected , he was very much vex 'd at it , and so stab 'd himself , tho ' not ( I believe ) with a Design to take away his own Life , but only to territy me , by making me think that he had done himself a greater Mischief than he really had : But I suppose , when he found himself wounded deeper than he intended , he pull 'd off his Coat , and went towards the Cock to wash himself ; but being too weak , he might fall down . I staid above a pretty while , to see if he would come up again of his own Accord ; but he not coming , I went down as naked as ever I was born , to see what was the matter ; and seeing him lie all along , I thought he was either in Fitts , or feign 'd himself to be so . - Speak to me , Dickey , ( says I ) My dear Dickey speak to me , and do n't lie so to frighten me : But he made no Answer . - As to what Mr. Cooper swore about my saying I had given the Deceased an unhappy Blow , he mistook my Words ; for I said , that the Deceased had given me many an unhappy Blow . The Jury acquitted her of the first Indictment , and found her guilty of the second . Death . John Webb , of S. Dunstan 's in the West , was indicted for stealing 20 s. the Money of Stephen Davis , on the 22d of June . Rebecca Davis thus deposed : I had 20 s. in my Compter-Drawer , ty 'd up in a Glove . The Prisoner came in for a Pint of Small-Beer ; and soon after he was gone , I must the Money . An Acquaintance of the Prisoner inform 'd me where he was .

The Prisoner waited upon 'em ; he being hired by Mr. Lloyd to assist in attending Company for that Day . The Prosecutor laid his Sword in the Window , and happen 'd to go away without it . Some other of the Servants going to clear the Room , saw the Prisoner with that Sword in his Hand ; they told him whose Sword it was , and bid him carry it to the Bar ; but he assured them that he would not ; for as he had found it , he 'd keep it , that he had got nothing by his Master that Day , and therefore was resolved to take Care of himself .

The Prisoner in his Defence said , that Brown 's Daughter rode the Mare up to London , and order 'd him to sell her ; and Lankton not appearing to prove that he bought the Mare of the Prisoner , the Jury acquitted him .

Smith by giving him with a Sword one mortal Wound near the Right Breast of the Depth of four Inches , and Breadth of half an Inch , on the 12th of June , of which he instantly died ; and John Stockton for being present , aiding and abetting the said Smith in the said Murder . They were a 2d time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for Manslaughter . Eleanor Maccauley thus deposed : The Deceased and the Prisoner Smith were Comrades , and lodg 'd together at the Bell Alehouse in Bell-Yard in King-Street , Westminster . At this Place they and Stockton ( the other Prisoner ) were drinking together upon the Saturday Evening that the Deceased was kill 'd . Some Words pass 'd betwixt them in Dutch , which I did not understand ; but afterwards the Deceased got up , and challeng 'd Smith to go into the Privy-Garden and fight him . Smith appeared very unwilling ; but the Deceased went out at the Door , drew his Sword , and swore that he would fight with one of them . Smith went with him at last . Stockton follow 'd them , and so did I and two or three more . When they came to the Privy-Garden , the Deceased stript , and drew first ; but Smith said , We had better let Fighting alone , Peter : - The Point of my Sword is broke : - We have seen old Comrades , and why should we fall out ? However , Peter would needs fight , and so they shook Hands and made several Pushes at one another . Smith wounded him . I was sent for a surgeon ; and when I came back the Deceased was dead . William Lamb thus deposed : Peter Colme ( the Deceased ) and the Prisoners were quarrelling at the Bell Alehouse , and says Peter to Stockton , You think yourself a brave Fellow , but if you fancy you 're a better Man than me , come out and I 'll fight you . Stockton declin 'd it ; upon which Peter grew very passionate , went out , drew his Sword , and challeng 'd either of 'em . I went up Stairs , and quickly after I was told , that Peter and Smith were gone to the Privy-Garden to fight . Stockton was still in the House ; I desired him not to meddle . I do not intend it , says he , for I shall get no Credit by it . He and I follow 'd the other two , and found the Deceased stript , with his naked Sword in his Hand . I had rather forbear Fighting , said Smith , for the Point of my Sword is blunted . Daniel Ogden thus deposed : As I was coming by the Privy Garden , Stockton stood at the Gate-way , thro ' which I saw two Men in a Posture of fighting . I had a mind to have gone in that Way ; but Stockton having a Stick in his Hand , and looking very sower , I was afraid to venture by him , and so I ran round another Way . When I came to them , the Deceased was wounded . The Prisoners then made their Defence . While we were drinking with Peter , ( said Smith ) I gave the Maid Half a Crown to change for some Meat ; upon which Peter bid her take all the Reckoning out of that Money . I ask 'd him what he meant by it , and he told me that I was the Man that he took me to be . What Man is that ? says I . Why , a Rascally Fellow , says he again . But if you are so bright a Man as you think yourself , come out and I will see you . I had no mind to quarrel , and so said but little more . Then Stockton and he went to Cards ; Peter won several Games , and Stockton would play no more . Peter then ask 'd me to play ; but I deny 'd him ; upon which , some other Words arising , he went out , drew his Sword , and cry 'd , Come out if you dare fight me . I went out and desired him to be quiet . He put up his Sword , and beckoned me to follow him , which I did to the Privy Garden , and there he drew again , and strips himself . Comrade , says I , What makes you so quarrelsome ? You do n't use to be so . If I have offended you , I will beg your Pardon . - You are a Coward , says he , to ask a Man 's Pardon , before you have ty 'd what he can do ; and I will post you for such as one , if you do n't fight . The Thames was just behind me and a Wall on each Side of me , so that I could not get from him . He stept up to me , and swore he would fight now . I told him the Point of my Sword was broke ; but all that I could say to prevent the Engagement , signify 'd nothing . I told him we would shake Hands first , which with much ado he did , and then we went to it . The Jury acquitted Stockton , and found Smith guilty of Manslaughter . Burnt in the Hand .

James 's Westminster , was indicted for the Murder of Job Dixon , by violently beating and throwing him down , on the 14th of May last , of which he languish 'd till the next day , and then died . He was a 2d time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for feloniously saying the said Job Dixon . John Francis thus deposed : About Three in the Afternoon , as the Deceased and the Prisoner were playing at Cards in a Brandy Shop by Stocks Market , I tipt the Wink upon the Deceased ; which the Prisoner perceiving , he challenged me to fight him in the Pest-Fields , which I accepted . We went thither , and he and I fought for six or seven Minutes , and then I gave out . Then he said , I will fight any one that takes your Part . - Will you ? ( said the Deceased , ) Then I am your Man : Whereupon the Prisoner struck him in the Face , and so they stript and fell to it ding dong . They took two or three Knocks together : The Deceased was thrown twice , and appeared not at all to be hurt ; but as soon as he got up again , the Prisoner kick 'd up his Heels , and threw him in the Grass , and there he lay stretch 'd out like a dead Man . He complain 'd of his Back and Neck . We were for fetching a Coach to carry him Home ; but the Prisoner made his Game , and said , What are you dead already ? - Ill carry you Home upon my Back ; but at last we got a Chair , and he died the next day . Samuel Burdon thus deposed : There was no foul Play , not any Stones where the Deceased fell . 'T is a Place of Trees and Grass , and a Sort of Burying Ground ; but I am not a capable Judge how the Man came by his Death . Joseph Clements the Surgeon thus deposed : I saw the Deceased after he was put to Bed : I could perceive no Fracture , no Wound , no Dislocation , nor even any Discolouring , but he had lost the Use of all his Limbs , and had no more Strength than a New-born Child . I suspected indeed that his Skull was fractured ; but I found it otherwise by putting something in his Mouth , which he held fast with his Teeth . I ca n't think what could be the Cause of his Death , except it was a Distortion of the Spinal Marrow , which , I believe , took away the Use of his Limbs . William Sanson , Apothecary , thus deposed : I have been informed that the Deceased fell backwards , with his Neck almost double ; by which Fall 't is likely , that the Ligament that holds the Vertebrae of the Neck was extended ; and by the great Concussion of the Bones , the Spinal Marrow was distorted , which might be the Occasion of his Death . Hannah Wilding thus deposed : The Deceased and the Prisoner were such great Cronies before this Boxing Bout , that if the Deceased had but a Piece of Bread , and his Wife wanted it , he would give it to the Prisoner , and let his Wife go without . - The Court demanded , if the Deceased was known to be any way distemper 'd before this Misfortune happened ? To which this Evidence thus answer 'd , I am not a confident Judge of such Matters ; but if he had any disease , I believe some that are left behind are the worse for him . - Dixon , the Deceased 's Father , deposed , that he heard the Deceased say , The Rogue that I loved so well has killed me . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaughter . Burnt in the Hand . Daniel Calighan , was indicted for stealing two Pair of Stockings , a Ring , two Moidores , and 3 l. 4 s. in Silver , the Goods and Money of William Aldred , on the 14th of May last . Guilty .

Elizabeth Lion thus deposed : The Prisoners , who are Bailiff s , came to my House , with John Richardson , about Five in the Afternoon . Richardson threw me upon my Back , and swore he 'd be my Death , if I would not let him have to do with me . Then Dowler took me a Slap o'the Face , and dash 'd one of my Teeth out ; and after that he pull 'd out his Penknife , and swore he would stick my Heart 's Blood out , if I did not let Richardson do so and so . Whereof he took away my Pocket-Apron , in which there was a Ring and 7 s. 6 d. but the Ring dropt out , and so I got it again . - I sha n't mind what they say of me , for I have as good a Character as any Woman in my Business . Hannah White thus deposed : As I was coming from Chelsea , I saw Jefferies a making Water at Mrs . Lion 's Door . How do you do , Mr. Jefferies ? said I . Will you go in and drink with me ? No , says he , for I have got a Couple of Friends in the House , and I expect a little Fun by and by . Elizabeth Shower thus deposed : I am Lodger in Mrs . Lion 's House . Richardson threw her down ; Jefferies held her Hands ; and Douler with a Penknife cut her across the Forehead , and swore he would stick her to the Heart if She would not let him * * * quietly ; and so they took hold of her -- -- What d 'ye call it ? -- -- her Pocket-Apron ; and pull 'd it quite off . The Prisoners then made their Defence . This Good-Woman ( says Dowler ) keeps a Bawdy-House in Chelsea Fields , and I going thither to arrest one of her Plyers , a whole Heap of them fell upon me , so that I narrowly escaped , as I shall prove by good Witness . Margaret Turner thus deposed : I live next door to Mother Lion 's . - Dowler and two more came thither , and ask 'd for Betty Palmer . I advised them not to go in , because the People were quarrelsome ; but they would go in : Whereupon Mother Lion took and thrust Betty Palmer into one of her Backsides ; for I dare swear she has got twenty of them ; and then she calls out to two Irish Hay-makers that belong to her House , Come out ye Sons of Bitches , for here 's a Parcel of Thieving Bailiffs . They fell upon the Prisoners , and tore their Shirts off . One of them was going to knock down Dowler with a Quart Bottle ; but he was prevented by John Jones , who took it from him ; then he got his Pitch-Fork , and Dowler ran for a Mop-Stick : One took up the Poker , and another the Tongs , and so they went at it to some Tune , and Dowler nointed the Haymaker handsomely .

Alexander Ross thus deposed : I met the Prisoner in the Street , and invited her to take a Glass . She perceiving me to be a Foreigner , spoke to me in French ; and we agreed to go to the Dog Tavern upon Ludgate-Hill . While we were drinking there , she desired me to lend her some Money ; I told her I had none to lend ; and putting my Hand in my Pocket , I took out Two Shillings . She told me that would not do ; therefore I must give her more . I then took out Half a Crown , and with it a Silk Purse that I brought from Berlin ; but I do n't remember whether it was green or blue . She took the Half Crown , and pray 'd me to let her look upon the Purse , for the very much admired it . I put it into her Hand , and she emptied it into her Lap . There were 7 Broad Pieces , 4 Guineas , and 4 Gold Rings set with Diamonds . She look 'd them all over , and then put them into my Purse again , and return 'd it to me , and I put it into my Pocket ; but it was not long before I miss 'd it ; and ( knowing that she had been a little busy about my Breeches ) I ask 'd her if she had not taken it in Jest ? She told me she never saw it , and was for going away ; but I stopt her . She call 'd the Drawer ; and when he came up , I bid him bring another Bottle ; but when he saw her so unwilling to stay , he would not bring it . I told him what I had lost ; and he bid me look well about the Room to see if I had not dropt it ; but I was unwilling to take my Eye off of the Prisoner , that she might have no Opportunity of conveying the Purse away . The Drawer then told us , if we would not agree , and go away quietly , he 'd fetch a Constable ; and so he did I charged the Constable with her , and desired him to search her , but he excused himself ; and she said she 'd let any Woman search her , but no Man ; and so she was not search 'd at all ; and the Constable carry 'd me to Prison ; but what he did with her , I can not tell . The Jury acquitted her .

I went , and found this Man in Company with the Prisoner ; and he bid the Prisoner go along with me for the Money to his Uncle Strange , at the Salutation Tavern in Lombard Street . I left my Goods at the White-Hart , and went with the Prisoner to the Salutation . He stept up to the Bar , and presently came back , and said that his Uncle was gone to the Coffee-House . Then I began to mistrust him , and was going to lay hold on him ; but he was aware of me , took to his Heels , and bid me go look my Cloth and be damn 'd . Hamlet Johnson thus deposed : A Man bought some Sacking of me at Hoxton , and bid me bring it to the Hercules Pillars near Temple Bar . When I and my Chapman came there , the Prisoner sat drinking by himself ; and my Chap told him that he had bought the Cloth for his Uncle Strange . I left the Cloth , and went with 'em both to the Horseshoo . The Prisoner lighted his Pipe ; and the other Man went out . In a little while after , I ask 'd the Prisoner were he was gone ? Why , says the Prisoner , he 's gone to a Brother of mine at the Hercules Pillars ; but I 'll go and see for him ; and so he walks out leisurely with his Pipe in his Mouth , and never came back to pay the Reckoning ; but he was afterwards taken up with a Search-Warrant .

When she saw me , she fell on her Knees and ask 'd my Pardon , and confess 'd that she had brought the Cloaths away .

He was a 2d time indicted for the Murder of Joseph West , at Guinea , by beating him with a Cane on the Head , Back , Breast and Sides , on the 12th of January , in the 10th Year of his present Majesty 's Reign , of which he languish 'd till the 28th of the same Month , and then died . Benjamin Bush thus deposed : I was Surgeon in the Christopher Galley , of which the Prisoner was Captain . On the 12th of January , 1723. we went with our Boats up the River Andona to buy Slaves and Palm Oil . Atkinson ( one of the Deceased ) happened to set a small jar of Palm Oil ( about the Value of 5 or 6 s. ) upon some Bars of Iron that lay in the Fore Sheets of the Long Boat . The Prisoner soon after ordered West ( the other Deceased ) to hand some of those Bars out of the Boat ; and West , in taking one of the Bars up , threw down the Jar , and broke it . The Prisoner flew into a violent Passion , and ask 'd who set the Jar in that Place ? And one of the Crew told him , that it was Jack Atkinson . Then he swore , G - for ever D - 'em , says he , I 'll beat them both alike . He had got a knotted Cane in his Hand , about an Inch and a half thick ; ( we call it a Bamboo Cane ) and with this Cane he knock 'd them both down , and fell a beating of them in a very furious manner . I was then in another Boat about three Fathom from the Long Boat ; so that I heard and saw all that pass 'd betwixt 'em . I haul 'd up my Boat close to him , and ask 'd him , if he intended to kill the Men ? G - D - you , says he , I 'll kill ye all before I go aboard the Ship . But then , Captain , says I , how will you get your Boats aboard ? ( for we were then Ten Leagues up the River Andona . ) He Scratch 'd his Ears , and cry 'd , Why then , D - you all , I 'll kill you when I have got ye aboard . He still kept beating the two Men till his Cane was broke all to Pieces : I believe he gave them a Hundred Blows apiece , and then , as they lay down , he stampt upon their Breasts , till the Blood gush 'd out of their Mouths , and so left them in a miserable Condition , and never ordered any Care to be taken of them . When we came on Board , I apply 'd a Seton to each of their Poles . Each of them was seized with a violent Fever : They spit Blood daily , and Atkinson grew delirous Their Heads especially were black with Bruises , very much swell 'd , and as soft as an Apple . Yet , tho ' they were so extremely ill , the Prisoner never Shew 'd the least Regard to them ; but , on the contrary , if he came by them as they lay upon the Deck , he would kick them , stamp upon them , strike them in the Face with his Fist , and make them get up to work . I remember the second day after their Beating , that West was put to the Helm ; and I coming upon the Deck , he call 'd to me , For God 's Sake , Doctor , says he , take hold of the Helm , for I am not able to stand ; and before I came to him , he fell down . They both died in Calabar River ; Atkinson in fifteen days , and West in nineteen days after the Prisoner beat them ; and I verily believe that that Beating threw them into the Fever , and was the Cause of their Death . Before they died , they desired me to write their Wills , which I did ; but the Prisoner having some Intimation of it , he called me down between Decks one day , and clapping a Pistol to my Breast , I understand , Doctor , says he , that you have got the Wills of these Fellows ; and if you do n't deliver it to me , or let me see you tear it , by G - I 'll shoot you thro ' the Body this Minute . So I fetch 'd it , and tore it before his Face . The Prisoner thus made his Defence : Atkinson and West died of a violent Flux and Fever , ( the common Distemper of the Country ) which they brought upon themselves by drinking Palm Wine , and eating Plantanes . My Gunner and Jerry Clampet , and two or three more , died of the same Distemper , much about the same time ; and whatever the Doctor swears now about Atkinson and West , he then turned them and some others over to the Boatswain , and told him they were a Parcel of lazy Sons of Bitches ; that they were able enough to work , if they were but willing ; and they afterwards did their Duty . To this the Doctor thus answered : The two deceased Men were free from the Country Distemper ; one of 'em indeed had a small Looseness , but nothing like a Flux : I believe they did drink some Palm Wine during their Illness , but not to excess , and I do n't know they eat any Plantanes As for turning them over to the Boatswain , I never did , for it was not them , but the Gunner and Jerry Clampet ; nor did they do Duty after the Prisoner beat them , for they were not able ; only , as I said before , he forced them to do something . Then the Prisoner call 'd his Witnesses . John Elms thus deposed : I was Carpenter and Second Mate , and I Staid on board while the Boats went up Andona River ; and when they came back , I heard that the two deceased Men and the Doctor had got drunk and tumbled over-board ; and that the Captain had given the two Deceased three or four Blows with a Rattan . I did not hear them complain of being beat ; they did their Duty aboard ; and I did not see that they ail 'd any thing ; - not but that they had Setons and Blisters upon 'em : But then they had such a violent Flux , that it run from 'em all over the Deck , and I could have thrust my Hand up their Fundaments , they were grown so very wide . I remember , that 14 or 15 days after they were beat , they were both very well , and the Doctor turn 'd 'em over to the Boatswain , and said they were lazy Dogs , and able enough to work ; - tho ' indeed they were then in a sort of a Fever , and had several Blisters upon them , and one of 'em died the next day , and t'other in two or three days after him ; but then there were seven more that had got a Flux at the same time . James Hunter , a Surgeon , thus deposed : I have been in that Country , and know that Plantanes are apt to give a Flux ; - and I do n't know but they may cause Spitting of Blood . The Palm Wine will seldom keep 24 Hours ; 't is like Canary in the Morning , Syder at Noon , and Vinegar at Night . It being so pleasant in a Morning , the Sailors are commonly so fond of it , that they drink to Excess , the Consequence of which is commonly a great Flux , tho ' not always attended with a Fever . Several Witnesses deposed , that they heard the Doctor say , - I never knew that the Captain did any Hurt to any Man : - He turn 'd me out of my Place . - I went on Shore , and he would not let me come on board again ; and therefore I swore against him , and had him clapt in Irons at Barbadoes . - If I do n't hang him , he 'll hang me . - I shall have Fifty Pound for hanging the Captain . - He would have swore away my Life for not taking Care of the Men , and therefore I swore shift to prevent it . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of Manslaughter . Burnt in the Hand . Henry Wade , was indicted for stealing a hind Quarter of Veal , the Goods of Thomas White , on the 11th of June . It appeared that the Prisoner took the Veal out of a Hamper in Leadenhall Market , and was stopt with it upon his Back . The Prisoner in his Defence said , he was drunk when he did it , and call 'd one or two to his Reputation . William Longstaffe thus deposed : I am a Mason by Trade , and I live upon Saffron Hill The Prisoner 's Father is a Mason 's Labourer ; I know him very well , and he 's a very honest Man , as I take it , and so is his Wife ; but as for his Son , ( the Prisoner ) I never knew any Good of him .

Elizabeth How thus deposed : The Prisoner came to my Shop in Bishopsgate-street , and told me that he came from Mr. Corbet for six Silk Handkerchiefs . I knowing Mr. Corbet very well , and taking the Prisoner to be his Man , I deliver 'd 11 Handkerchiefs to him , that his Master might take his Choice ; and he went away with them . Edward Harton thus deposed : I am a Glasier , and live on one Side of the same Shop as Mrs. How lives in . I mistrusted the Prisoner , and ask 'd her , if she knew him ? She told me , No . Whereupon I follow 'd him , to see if he went to Mr. Corbet 's , who lives upon College-Hill . Before he was gone far , he met another Man , with whom he went thro ' Sun-Yard into Broad-street , and so through Newgate . There being two of them , I call 'd a Porter to assist me , and stopt the Prisoner , and he deliver 'd the Goods to me out of his Bosom ; but the other ran away . The Prisoner thus made his Defence : I met Mr. Corbet 's Servant , and he told me that his Master had sent him for some Handkerchiefs to Mrs. How 's ; but that he did not care to go , because he ow 'd a little Money thereabouts : and therefore if I would go and fetch them and some other Things at two or three other Shops , and bring them to him at a House upon Snow-Hill , ( but I have forgot the Sign ) he would give me 18 d. So I agreed , and he gave me a Note of Directions at what Shops to call , and what Goods to ask for . Mr. Corbet thus deposed : I never saw the Prisoner before Mr. Harton brought him to me to enquire if I had sent him to Mrs. How 's , and then he gave me the Note of Directions , that he says he had from my Servant . This is the same Note , and I believe it is my Servant 's Writing ; but that Servant was gone from me before the Fact was committed of which the Prisoner is now indicted . The Jury acquitted him . Daniel Ferry , and Magneta Green , were indicted for persuading John Chambers to committ Perjury . But no Evidence appearing , they were acquitted .

Last Wednesday Night the Prisoner came to my Shop in Petty-France , and sold me this Book , The Principles and Duties of the Christian Religion , for a Shilling , - 't is worth Half a Crown . Soon after he was gone , I found my own Mark at the End of it ; by which I concluded that it was stolen from my other Stall . I told my Son of it , and he said he had lost such a Book . Tho King Jun . thus deposed : The next Day I saw the Prisoner at my Father 's Stall in Token-House-Yard ; and by the Description my Father gave me of him , I believe him to be the same Person that stole the Book ; and so I went into a Neighbour 's House and watch 'd him . He took out The History of the Pyrates look 'd about him , put it into his Bosom , and was going off ; but I being called out , he laid it down again . Guilty Val . 10 d. Transportation .
