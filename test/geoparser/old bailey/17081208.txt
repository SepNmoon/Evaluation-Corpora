See summary . ] Webb Rawlins , Gabriel Huff , and Elizabeth Rawlins , of St. Giles 's without Cripplegate , were all 3 Indicted for the Murder of Jacob Hamson , Esq ; by giving him one mortal bruise with a wooden Staff on the hinder part of his Head near the Crown , on the 25th of October , 1707. of which he instantly died . They were a 2d time Try 'd upon the Coroners Inquest , for the Murder of the said Jacob Hamson . The first Evidence for the Queen , was one Katharine Miller , who depos 'd , that on the 25th of October , 1707. she agreed with one James Callow to meet that Evening at the Farthing Pye house , and accordingly about 5 a Clock she went and enquir 'd for him there , but was told by Elizabeth Rawlins , that he was with her Son at the 3 Fighting Cocks in Bunning-Fields ; That she waited some time for him , and as she sat , a Boy came in to light a Link , and the Daughter went to Bed ; so that no Body was left in the Room but her self and Mrs. Rawlins ; that at 7 a Clock she heard a Whistling , and at that time Web Rawlins and Johnson brought in the Deceas 'd with a Hankerchief about his Mouth , and Callow and Huff were with them : They carried him into a Room adjoining that wherein she was , and they all went in and shut the Door . That she heard a scuffling Noise , and ask 'd Mrs. Rawlins the Reason ? Who answered , it was nothing but a drunken Man ; but the Noise encreasing , she with Mrs. Rawlins step 'd to the Door and look 'd in , and saw the Person that was brought in , upon the Ground all Bloody ; that the Blood gush 'd from his Nose and Mouth , and he was dead . That she saw his Peruke , a Spying-Glass , and a pair of Scales upon the Table ; that then Webb Rawlins rifled him of what he had in his Pockets , took out a silver oval Tobacco Box , a Tooth Pick-case , a Tobacco Stopper , a Watch , and 50 s. in Mony , and gave them to Callow ; that there was a bloody Handkerchief , which Callow brought her afterwards to wash for him . That Elizabeth Rawlins cry 'd out ( when she saw the Deceas 'd Murdered ) to her Son , what have you done ? My Son will ruin me , At which her Son and Huff presented two Pistols at her , and bid her hold her Tongue : That between 8 and 9 , when they found the way clear , Johnson took him upon his Back , and carry 'd him cross the Field , and threw him in a Ditch ; that she bought a 2 d Cheese Cake , and gave a piece to her Bedfellow . This Evidence was supported by abundance of concurrent Circumstances , as first , That the Deceas 'd went from Aldersgate-street between 6 and 7 , was met about 7 within 30 Yards of Rawlins 's House ; that about that time 4 Men were seen there , and 1 came up to a Person going by , look 'd him in the Face , and told the rest , It is not him ; That the Woman at the next House , heard a noise of Scuffling , and ( as she express 'd it ) one Sqwal ; that about 8 a Man saw a Person looking pale come out of Rawlins 's House to him , and in a great Consternation stamp 'd upon the Ground , and ask 'd him , whether he was going this way , or that way ? That Miller upon her Examination describ 'd the Room where the Deceas 'd was suppos 'd to be Murder 'd , and said that in such a part of it , there was Blood upon the Boards ; and upon viewing the Room as she describ 'd , there was a place in the Boards had been scrap 'd as with a Knife , and some brown spots remaining , suppos 'd to be Blood : It was proved that the Deceas 'd us 'd to carry those things about him , which Miller mention 'd were taken from him ; and particularly Millers Bedfellow depos 'd , that Miller gave her a piece of a Cheescake , and she saw the bloody Handkerchief ; and that Webb Rawlins came the next Day being Sunday , and pull 'd out a silver Tobacco Box , and beat it to pieces with a Poker , and pull 'd out a Spying-glass ; which this Witnesslooking upon , he swore she must not see it ; and Mr. Hampson had such things about him , when Murder 'd ; with many other Circumstances too large to incert in this Paper . The Prisoners in their defence deny 'd the Fact and Huff produc 'd several Witnesses , to prove that he was at Home from the Morning till he went to Bed , and was that Night at Supper with some Friends at his own House , which was at Old-street , it being St. Crispin 's Day , a remarkable time : Webb and Elizabeth Rawlins produc 'd Witnesses who depos 'd they had not been from Home that Day , neither had there been any Company at their House from the Morning till their time of going to Bed , except one Man for a Quartern of Brandy in the Morning , and a Woman in the Afternoon for a 2 d Cheescake : Upon the whole , the Jury acquitted the Prisoners . They were a 2d time Indicted with one James Callow , for feloniously stealing Goods from the Person of Jacob Hamson . But that Tryal depending upon the Success of the other , the Court did not proceed to the Examination of Witnesses . Ann Ross , of St. James 's Westminster , was Indicted for feloniously stealing a Muslen Apron , and a suit of Headcloaths , the Goods of Jane Meckinsy , on the 8th of September last .

The Evidence not being sufficient to convict the Prisoner , the Jury acquitted him . William Scot , was Indicted for Assaulting and Wounding James Alexander the Lord Chancelor 's Porter , on the 12th of October last . It appear 'd that the Prisoner came to the Lord Chancellors , and told the Porter he wanted to speak with his Lordship ; he asked his Business the Prisoner told him it was about a Pass for Holland ; the Porter directed him to the Secretaries Office for a Pass ; but the Prisoner not content with that Answer , abus 'd him , at which the Porter took him by the Arm to turn him out ; but the Prisoner broke his Head with a Cane , and pull 'd out a Pistol charg 'd and shot at him , but it flash 'd in the Pan . He call 'd a Reverend Divine to his Reputation , who declar 'd , he had read Prayers for him in Petticoat-Lane , and always behav 'd himself with abundance of Modesty and Sobriery ; but that he had reason to believe he was disturb 'd in his Head ; The Fact being plain , the Jury found him guilty of the Indictment .

See summary . ] Joseph Hatfield , John Weatherly and John Filewood , were all three Indicted for privately stealing a Show Glass with Goods in it to the value of 130 l. belonging to Samuel Pattison , on the 8th of October last .

That the next Morning , one Mrs. Girton came to the Prosecutors , and told him she saw the Robery committed , and describ 'd to him the 3 Prisoners , and how it was done .

It did not appear that there was any premeditated Malice between them , but what was done , was purely the Effect of Distraction ; the Jury acquitted him . Ann Barker , was Indicted for stealing a Loin of Veal , the Goods of William Gathorn ; the Jury acquitted her . William Lavender , was Indicted for feloniously stealing a black Mare , the Goods of Edmund Peachey , on the 5th of January , 1707. the Jury acquitted him .

The Prisoner in his Defence brought Evidence to prove , that handing Mrs. Rudge along Fleet-street , her Husband being then before , were met by the Deceas 'd and 2 Men more ; That the Deceas 'd laid hold of her Waist , and would have taken her from the Prisoner ; That being affrighted they were forc 'd to carry her into the Green Dragon Tavern , where she fell into Fits ; that the Deceas 'd follow 'd them in , and first gave the Assault .
