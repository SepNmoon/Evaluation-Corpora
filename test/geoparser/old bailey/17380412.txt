The Prisoner came into the Field where my Horses were at Work , on the 8th of March , and view 'd them : I had been sowing some Barley , and was then harrowing the Ground . After he had look 'd at the Horses , he went into my Yard ; I watched him , and saw him come out again . When we had done Work that Night , I put up the Horses and made the Stable Door fast . The next Evening , March the 9th , about 9 o'Clock , I saw them safe in the Stable again ; and went to smoke a Pipe with my Landlord 's Man , about 11 I return 'd , and found the Stable Door broke open , and the Horse was gone : He was afterwards taken in the Hands of the Prisoner , at Staines , by the Bellman , who informed me of him the next Morning . Sam Perkins . While I was upon the Watch in the Morning , the Prisoner came driving the Horse before him along the Road ; I cry 'd Hallo , and he answered me once ; I call 'd to him a 2d Time , and he made no Answer , but kept beating the Horse on . I saw he had a Hempen Halter in his Mouth , so I got to his Head and stopp 'd him ; I asked the Prisoner where he had the Horse , he told me , and by his Directions I went down to Ivall , at South Warnborough , where the Prosecutor lives , and he claim 'd it . The Prisoner confessed the Fact very plainly . Guilty . Death . 5. William Miller , was indicted for stealing 72 lb . of Beef , value 10s . in the Parish of St .

John Toon and Edward Blastock , were indicted for assaulting Edward Seabrook on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a silver Watch , value 5l and 16s . in Money , Feb. 27 . Edward Seabrook . On the 27th of Feb I was riding from Muzzel-Hill towards Highgate ; the 2 Prisoners came up one on each side of me ; and clapping Pistols to my Breast , they demanded my Money . I begg 'd of them not to use me ill , and told them they should have it ; so I put my Hand in my Pocket , and pull 'd out about 16 or 18s . Toon held his Hat for the Money , and as I threw it into his Hat , a half Crown and a Shilling stuck upon the Brims , and fell from thence to the Ground ; he stoop 'd down to look for the Money that was dropp 'd , but found only the Shilling Toon then proposed to search me for more ; and Blastock seeing the String of my Watch , he told Toon that I had got one , and Toon demanded it from me . As soon as I had delivered it , Blastock took off my Horse 's Bridle , and flung it away , then he whipp 'd my Horse out of the Road , and the Creature immediately fell to grazing . They had both dismounted to rob me , and when they had got my Money and Watch , they mounted again , and gallop 'd away . Upon this , I went to catch my Horse : but he seeing their Horses galloping , he gallop 'd after them , and they perceiving a Horse following them , were 'frighted ( I suppose ) and imagined I was pursuing them , so they quitted their Horses and made off on Foot . I went on to Highgate , and there I found all the 3 Horses . The People advised me to go before a Justice and make Oath of the Robbery ; accordingly I went before Sir John Austin ; he order 'd the Prisoner 's Horses to be Pounded , and I advertised them that Evening . I got my Horse again , ( after he had run away from me ) in 10 Minutes ; for I was not above a Quarter of a Mile from the Town , nor above half a Mile from Highgate Church when I was robb 'd . I am very positive to both the Prisoners ; tho ' before Blastock was taken , I said , I believ 'd I could not know much of him ; but when he was in Newgate I pick 'd him out from 5 or 6 People . I remember 'd his Coat again perfectly well . Toon . I know my self to be very guilty , and will not give the Court any Trouble at all Blastock Mr. Seabrook came to Newgate and demanded the Prisoners to be brought down ; six of us came down together ; and he pick 'd out one Stevens , and said he was the Man that robb 'd him . Mr Seabrook . I pick 'd Blastock out , and no one else ; tho ' he was disguised with a Napkin round his Head , yet I knew him again , and he fell down upon his Knees , and begg 'd Mercy . Blastock . Did I take your Money and Watch ? Mr. Seabrook Toon took the Money and Watch , and Blastock held my Horse . Blastock . Ask him how he comes to be so positive to me ? Mr. Seabrook . As soon as I saw his Face again I knew it ; beside , he had the same Cloaths on , as he had when he robb 'd me , his Coat had been torn , 't was mended in this Part of it , and it had brass Buttons upon it . He begg 'd Mercy upon his Knees , and I told him , I believed it was not in my Power to shew him any . Edmund Grimston . On the 24th of Feb. Blastock hir 'd two Horses of me , one he said was for himself , and the other for a Friend , to carry them to Edmonton . As he was a Stranger to me , I desir 'd to know where he liv 'd , he told me his Name was Jones , that he was a Barber , and had liv 'd with one Mr. Brown a Hatter , in the Temple-Lane , about 7 Months . I was not willing to let my Horses without some Satisfaction ; therefore I went and enquired after this Jones , and Mr. Brown told me Mr. Jones was an honest Man ; upon this I let Blastock and his Companion have the Horses . The Prisoners are the Men ; and the Horses that were Pounded at Highgate , were the same they had from me . They had them on Saturday the 25th , and I advertised them on the Monday following . Blastock . Mr. Toon desired me to hire the two Horses for him , but what he did with them I can not tell . William Manton . I was the Constable that took Toon ; I carry 'd him before Justice Poulson , where he confessed the Fact . Blastock acknowledged it likewise at the Castle Tavern in Drury-Lane ; and when he was before Justice Chamberlain , he sent for the Coat he had on when he robb 'd Mr. Seabrook , and Mr. Seabrook knew it again . - Moor . I went with the Constable to take Blastock , in Drury Lane . We found him hid in Guley , and carry 'd him to the Castle Tavern ; I went to Newgate for a Pair of Handcuffs ; I did not hear him confess at the Tavern , but as we were bringing him down Holborn , I heard him own he committed this Robbery and that Toon had drawn him into this . William Linton . I live at the Corner of the Sessions House Gate . I was sitting in the Lodge when Mr. Seabrook came in , and desir 'd to see the Prisoners . He was shewn 5 or 6 Persons , among whom was the Prisoner . At first , he said he did not see the Man ; but afterwards he said , the Coat the Prisoner had on , was like that which the Man wore when he robb 'd him . Mr. Seabrook told the Prisoner , he was sorrier for him , than he was for himself , and that he would not swear to him . Nathan Brown . I know nothing of the Matter ; I was subpaena 'd here , but I ca n't say any Thing to the Affair . Blastock was Apprentice to a Barber in the Temple , and 9 or 10 Years ago he lodged in my House , and afterward in the Neighbourhood : I know no ill of him . Daniel-Hawkins I have known Blastock 11 or 12 Years : I went ( with one Mr. Turner ) to Mr. Seabrook , and asked him who robb 'd him ? He told me he could swear to Toon , but the other was a Barber , and he could not swear to him . Mr. Seabrook . I do n't know but I might say so before I had seen him . Hawkins . I do n't remember the particular Time when Mr. Seabrook said this . Blastock has had dealings with me , and I took him to be an honest Man . John Blastock , Robert Goddard , John Young , Edward Blastock , and Elleanor Wildair , appeared to the Prisoner Blastock 's Character . The Prisoner Toon 's Wife The Day after my Husband was taken , I saw Mr. Seabrook ; he told me he was sorry Mr. Toon was taken ; and as to Blastock , he said , he should not know him again . After Blastock was taken , I told Mr. Seabrook that I had been informed he had pick 'd him out from among four or five Prisoners ; yes , says he , I did ; but 't was by the Descriptions People gave me of him ; I can not swear to him . Mr. Chamberlain . When Toon was brought before me , he inform 'd me that Blastock was concern 'd in this Robbery . Upon his , and his Wife 's Information , Blastock was taken in Drury Lane : He had not been a Moment before me , but he own 'd himself a dead Man , and said he never committed but this one Robbery in his Life . I asked him , how it was that he had Courage enough to rob on the Highway , and yet be frighted by a Horse , without a Rider ? He said , it was even so ; they did not look behind them , but quitted their Horses , and got to London on Foot . He told me farther , that they had each of them a Pistol , - but one had never a Flint , and the other had no Pan Miss Jacky Stevens . ( a Convict of last Sessions ) I come here upon Mr. Blastock 's Account ; what I heard Mr. Seabrook say , - He said , that as how , - when we was called down below , - he walked about , and said , as how he could ( not ) swear to no Man that was there . John Bugdon . I am now under Sentence of Death . - John Barker . I am a Prisoner , upon a Charge of Perjury , and heard Mr. Blastock say , he could swear to no one but Toon . The Jury found both the Prisoners Guilty . Death . 10 , 11.

Judith Murray , ( otherwise Judith the Wife of William Tinman ) ) William Tinman , and Philip Murray , of St. Leonard Shoreditch , were indicted , for that they not having God before their Eyes , & c and not being Persons employed at the Mint in the Tower , ( not any of them ) for our Sovereign Lord the King , nor weighing the Duty of their Allegiance , but contriving and intending our Lord the King , and his People , feloniously and traiterously to deceive and defraud , on the 11th of March , 22 Pieces of false , feigned and counterfeit Money , of Pewter , Tin , Lead , and other Metal , in the Likeness of Shillings , falsely , deceitfully and traiterously , did Forge and Coin , to the evil Example of Others , & c. against their Duty and Allegiance , and against the Form of the Statute . They were a 2d Time indicted , for that they not being Persons employ 'd , nor any of them , for the Mint in the Tower , or elsewhere , for our Lord the King , nor being lawfully authorized by the Lord High Treasurer , or Commissioners of the Treasury for the Time being , but not having God before their Eyes , & c. after the 15th of May 1697 , to wit , on the 11th of March , with Force and Arms , one Pair of Molds made of Chalk , on one of which Molds was impress 'd the Figure and Resemblance of one of the Sides of a Shilling , without any lawfull Authority or Excuse , knowingly and traiterously had in their Custody and Possession , in the dwelling House of William Saul , against the Duty of their Allegiance , & c. The Counsel for the King having open 'd the Charge , the following Witnesses were call 'd . Alice Donnavin I was born at Chester , but was bred up in Ireland : Judith Murray was born in Ireland . About the latter End of May last , I came from Ireland , with the two Murray 's , and we arrived at Park-Gate . At this Place she shew 'd me the bad Money , and said she was obliged to put it off for her Livelihood . She asked me if I would keep her Counsel ? I promis 'd I would ; upon which she shewed me about 8l . in these Shillings , which they dispos 'd of , upon the Road . She had a good Half Crown , which she gave her Brother Philip , and the Way was , to go to a House and call for something that came to a Groat or Six-pence : Philip threw down the Half Crown , and receiv 'd the Change in good Money ; then Judith would tell him he need not change his Half Crown , she would lend him a Shilling , so he used to take his Half Crown again , and return these Shillings for that and the Reckoning . Thus they changed the bad Money for good , and she told me , that was the Way in which she had got her Bread . I promis 'd to keep her Counsel , if she would let me into the Secret , and inform me how she made them , which she accordingly did as we were upon the Road , on this Side of Park-Gate . When we came to London , we took a Lodging in Drury-Lane , where she conceal 'd her making them from me , and I was suffered only to pass them away . Some Time after this , Judith Murray , and I , went to France , ( I do n't know the Time precisely ) and we left Philip Murray in England , while we went there to put off our bad Money . In France we got acquainted with the Prisoner Tinman : He came back with us , and we all three landed at Dover At a Place call 'd Hithe , we were detected , and though Judith Murray concealed her Molds , yet we were all taken up ; but we were discharged by a Justice of the Town of Hithe , because the Person could not swear positively to us . From this Place we came to London , and took a Lodging in Cable-street ; this was about three Months ago . Councel . Did you lodge at any Time in Holywell-Lane , in Shoreditch . Donnavin . Yes ; the Prisoners were taken there : We had lodg 'd there about three Weeks when they were taken ; but I never saw any Money made there , 'till the Day they were apprehended ; and that Morning Judith put the Chalk , ( or something White ) into the Molds , then she made an Impression , by putting a Shilling between them , and afterward fix 'd them . When the Molds were ready , she took two pewter Spoons which I had bought the Day before , and having broke them to Peices , she fill 'd a Tobacco Pipe : Phillip Murray held it in the Fire 'till the Pipe was red-hot ; then Judith pour 'd the Metal into the Molds , and Tinman clipp 'd the edges of the Shilling thus made They had made 8 of these Pieces , and had given me 3 or 4 to put off , before I left the House that Morning to detect them . Tinman clipp 'd the edges of some of the Pieces with a pair of Scissars , but not many , for Judith said , he did not do it right , and she could do them better herself . Phillip Murray colour 'd over the 4 Shillings they gave me that Morning with Quicksilver , and when I went out to pass them away , Judith desired Phillip Murray to go with me , for fear of any accident happening to me ; but I would not accept of his Company , because I intended to detect them . So I went out and got a Constable , and desired him to send for Mr. North . I told the Constable they were then at Work , and I placed him at a House over the way , where he was to stay 'till I went over to see whether they were still at Work , because she always hid her Molds out of the Room , when they had done with them . As I went up Stairs , I met Phillip coming down ; and I ask 'd him whether his Sister had done Coining . He told me No , and that he was going only for a Pint of Beer . I took the Pot out of his Hand , and said , I would fetch the Beer ; so he went up again , and I went over the way and told the Constable , and the Man he had with him , they might now go up . I went with them into the Room , and Judith when the Men came up Stairs , had got the Flasks ( or Molds ) in her Lap , and would have thrown them out of Window ; but I seiz 'd them in her Hand , and deliver 'd them to Mr. Rogers . There were about 18 s. found in the Room , besides the 4 they had finish 'd for me to put off This I believe is some of the Money . Phillip Murray . I did not Lodge at this Place ; Was not I sent for that Morning to Bleed my Sister ? Donnavin . No ; he was not sent for that Morning , but when he came he did Bleed her . He had been for some time from us , with a Friend , but he has put off this Money for us . Judith Murray . Had not you and I quarrell 'd ? Donnavin . We generally quarrell 'd , because I did not put off her Money , and frequently had Battles . Phillip Murray . Did not Mr. Haines go with the Constable , and did not he ask you , What you could charge me with ? Donnavin . Yes , and I said - with colouring the Money . I did not then recollect that he had melted the Metal , - I was in a Surprize . Phillip Murray . Did not you say you could charge me with nothing but putting off the Money ? Donnavin . I ca n't say whether I did or not . Thomas Rogers Donnavin came to me the 11th of March , about 9 in the Morning , and enquired for a Constable to take up some Coiners . She said she was a Party concern 'd , and was as bad as They . She told me farther , that there had been a Quarrel among them , and if she did not discover Them , they would impeach Her . Upon this Information , I went to the King John on Horseback , in Holywell lane , and placed my self in the House , so as to see her go in again , and had got Mr. Barlow along with me . Presently Donnavin return 'd to the Alehouse for a Pot of Purl , and bid us stay a little longer . She carry 'd up the Purl , and came down again to call us ; she went in first , we follow 'd her closely and found the 3 Prisoners in the Room . I am not positive whether Judith was sitting or standing , but they were all by the Fire , and we lock 'd the Door to keep all in , that were in . I asked Donnavin , who she charged with Coining ? She charg 'd all of them ; upon which Judith lifted up her Hands and cry 'd - What ! have you serv 'd me so ! And immediately she fell upon her Knees and beg 'd for Favour . They all seem 'd to be in a great Surprize , and lest any Mischief should happen , I order 'd them to turn out their Pockets . While this was doing , Mr. Barlow found the Molds , and opening of them , he said they were hot ; there was on one of them a visible Impression of the Head side of a King William 's Shilling , and on the other , the Impression was plain , but Blank . After this , Mr. Barlow found 18 Shillings in an old Cap , and I took 3 or 4 of them ; here they are , and I have mark 'd them . We carry 'd the Prisoners before Mr. Justice Wroth , and he committed them . Judith Murray . Donnavin brought me from Ireland , I was only her hired Servant . I ask her , Whether Phillip Murray was not to Bleed her in the Foot ? Because she said , that would make her Fairer , than Bleeding in the Arm would . Donnavin . I never spake about Bleeding at all . Councel . Did you find any Money upon any of them ? ( To Rogers . Rogers . No ; only a good Shilling upon Judith . Mr. Barlow . When we went into the Room , I think they were all sitting by the Fire ; Donnavin told us these were the Coiners , upon which Judith fell down upon her Knees ; and while Mr. Rogers was searching their Pockets for Fear of Mischief , I found the Moulds upon a Table by the Fire-side , covered with a Cloth , and they were hot . I found likewise 18 Shillings in the Crown of a Woman 's Cap , fifteen of them I mark 'd , and delivered to Mr. North . There was two or three Pipes lay upon the Table with the Moulds . Donnavin charged Judith Murray with coining them , Tinman with clipping them , and Philip Murray with silvering them , before Mr. Justice Wroth . I do n't remember that she charged Phil . with doing any thing in particular , till we came before the Justice . John Hain . I went to the Prisoner at the King John Alehouse , and asked Donnavin who she charged ? all three for coining , she said , and that the Boy was guilty of passing off bad Money , but yet she should save his Life . Mr. Barlow delivered me four of the Pieces to carry to the Tower ; I shewed them to Mr. North , and he told me he would come to us at the Alehouse very speedily ; as soon as he came , I went with him to search the Prisoner 's Room , and among the Ashes we found this Piece of Metal . Donnavin charg 'd Phil Murray with silvering the Shillings over , before the Justice . Mr. North . I act for the Solicitor of the Mint ; on Saturday the 11th of March , Mr. Hain called me to the Alehouse where the Prisoners were detain 'd , and from thence I went with him to search their Room ; we found in the Ashes some Bowls of Tobacco-pipes , discoloured with the Fire , as if Metal had been melted in them . I imagined the Holes in the Pipes would have been stopped by the running of the Metal when melted into them , but they were not . There were several Pieces of Metal in the Ashes , and in the Window I found this Bottle of Quicksilver . Mr. Barlow . When we seized the Prisoners , and brought them out of the Room , I locked the Door , and kept the Key in my Pocket till Mr. North came , then I gave it to Mr. Hain , that Mr. North and he might go and search the Room again . Mr. North . After I had searched the Room , I went to the Alehouse again and saw these Moulds , they were then perfect , and the Impression of the Head Side of the Shilling , was very plain upon one Part of the Moulds , upon the other it was plain . All the Pieces that were shewn to me exactly tally 'd with the Impression ; these are the same Moulds ( or Flasks ) which were then delivered to me , but the Chalk is now fell out and the Impression are destroyed . When they were before the Justice , Donnavin swore that Judith coin 'd them , Tinman cut off the Knobs and finish 'd the Edges , and Phil . Murray silver 'd them with Quicksilver . Phil . Murray . I was sent for to bleed my Sister ; I never had any Conversation with Donnavin , but work 'd hard for my Bread . Tinman . I chanced to be in the Room at this Time , but I never knew any thing of their making or putting off bad Money . Judith Murray . No one ever knew any thing of the Matter but Donnavin and I . She transported her own Brother , and was whipped at Dublin . Simon Cummins , Archibald Graham , - Roach , and Daniel Banfield , appeared to Tinman 's Character , and took him to be a very honest Man . - Jackson , - Craddock , - Murray , - Walker , - Harrison , Abraham Flawn , and - Archpool , appeared in Philip Murray 's Behalf , and gave him the Character of an industrious Lad . The Jury found all the Prisoners Guilty ; Death . 17.

William Burroughs . I had been to see a Woman Home who liv 'd in Spittlefields , and was returning back about eleven o'Clock ; as I came along under Bedlam Wall , I heard some Men coming up the Fields , so I put the String of my Watch into my Fob for fear of being robbed . When I got to Bedlam Gate , four Men came up to me , one of them endeavoured to strike up my Heels , but I kept him off with my Hands ; another of them clapp 'd his Hand before this Eye , and a Pistol was put close to the other ; in this Manner they held me , while they robbed me of the Things mentioned in the Indictment . They took from me my Watch , with the String and Seal , a Clasp Penknife , a Wire Tobacco-stopper , a Whistle made in the Shape of a Bugle Horn , tipp 'd with Silver , and a Flemish Pocket-Piece , which had Dantzick Skilling on the one Side , and a Crown , with a Flourish round it , on the other . I saw their Number by the Light of a Lamp at the Corner of the Place where they rifled me , but I do n't know any of them . I have been to see Swift ( the Evidence ) and Golding , since they were taken , and I do n't know any Thing of Swift , nor can I say the Prisoner was one of the Men that robbed me , nor was any of my Things found upon him . I can call Witnesses to prove that I have often said , that I knew none of them . Councel . Have you never said , that you believed Swift , the Evidence , was one of them ? Burroughs . No ; I never said any such Thing . The Evidence Swift , who was carried out of Court while Burroughs was under Examination , now was called in . Richard Swift . On the 6th of November , Golding the Prisoner , James Daws , John Markham , and I , met at Daws 's House in Barbican , and we all went out to rob somebody or other ; we agreed first of all to go to the King 's Road , where we robbed a Man and a Woman of Seven-pence Three Farthings ; then we came to Moorfields , and by Bedlam Wall we met Mr. Burroughs . The Prisoner put one of his Hands over one of the Prosecutor 's Eyes , and clapped his Pistol to the other ; Markham stood behind him , the other Man took the Goods from him , and I took his Money , which was Eleven Shillings . When we had robbed him , we bid him go about his Business ; then we went to Daws 's House , and shared the Money ; the Watch we carried to Rumford , and there we sold it for a Guinea and a Half ; Daws kept half a Guinea for his own Share , we three divided the Guinea between us , and had 7 s. apiece . Councel . How came you to be taken up ? Swift . I was not taken up for this Robbery . There were seven Aprons of Madam Beavis 's taken from Charter-House Square , and the Woman that had pawned them quarrelling with me and my Wife , she went and told Mrs. Beavis , that I stole them ; I was taken up for this Fact , but they were not able to swear any Thing against me , so I was discharged , and as I was coming Home , they desired me to make myself an Evidence , that I might get rid of my Companions , so I made my Information before Justice Poulson . The Prisoner pawned the Waistcoat and Shirt that is now upon his Back , to buy a Pair of Pistols for us to go out with I have been acquainted with him a Year , but this was the first Time we ever went out altogether . Thomas Sullivan . On the 26th of March , the Prisoner came to my House about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon , with another Man , and told me , he was informed , that Swift , being taken up for stealing some Linnen , had made an Information , in which he was included , and that if he should be taken , he should be hang 'd . Why your only Way , says I , is to make yourself an Evidence ; and I went with him to Justice Farmer 's at No . 14. in Princes-Square . We saw only his Clerk , and told him the Story , and that we desired the Prisoner 's Information might be taken . Mr. Warrener ( the Clerk ) refused to do any Thing in it , without we would give him a Guinea . I told him , that as the Prisoner came voluntarily , I would give him a Guinea the next Day , and in the mean Time I would give him my Note to pay him two Guineas , if I was not as good as my Word ; but he insisted upon having the Guinea down , so I was forced to send my Watch Home to my Spouse , as a Token for her to send me a Guinea ; when the Guinea came , Mr. Warrener had it , and took the Information , and as soon as the Prisoner had sworn to it , he and I , and another Man , went in Search of the Persons he had nam 'd in his Information , I remember this very Robbery was mentioned in it . The Court express 'd their Resentment of Mr. Warrener 's Behaviour ; and declar 'd it to be the Duty of all , who serve as Clerks under Gentleman in the Commission of the Peace , to be always ready to execute their office without Extortion . Charles Revington . On the 26th of March , I heard the Evidence Swift was taken on suspicion of stealing some Linnen . I saw him in New-Prison about 11 o'Clock , and wanting to make himself an Evidence , he went before Mr. Justice Poulson , but some People being with the Justice , he did not care to make the Discovery before them ; upon which he was remanded back till 2 o'Clock ; we then had a Warrant to take the Prisoner , and went to Old-street Square to enquire for him , but he was not at Home . He and the Evidence had been acquainted about a Year ; I have frequently seen them together . About three Weeks ago I saw Daws , Swift , the Prisoner and another , together in an Alehouse . Richard Warner . I have seen them often together , both by Day and Night . Thomas Pinkney . The Prisoner was my Apprentice , and serv 'd me honestly , 'till he got linked with this Evidence . I believe he never robb 'd me .

Thomas Loxley , a Soldier . The Prisoner work 'd with my Son a quarter of a Year and behav 'd well .

I know the Prisoner , William Lawrence ; he is a Shropshire Man . About Michaelmas last he became acquainted with me , and told me , I should be well encourag 'd and rewarded , if I could get any Men for him , that were 6 Foot high or upwards , out of his Majesty 's Forces , in Order to their being carry 'd to Prussia . To this End he has given me Money from Time to Time ; I have had 23 or 24 Shillings of him since Michaelmas last . Twice I had 2 Half-Guineas ; and at another Time , I had Half-a-Crown , which makes 23 s. 6 d Some trifling Pence I have had at other Times . Counc . Do you know Davison and White ? Snafe . Yes ; here they are . Counc . Do you remember their being in Company with the Prisoner at your House ? Snafe They were in his Company ( much about the same Time that I became acquainted with him ) in Windsor-Court in Drury-Lane ; and they have likewise been in his Company at the House to which I remov 'd , in Vinegar Yard in Guy's-Court , Drury-Lane ; both Houses are in the County of Middlesex ; Windsor-Court is on the other Side of Clare-Market , between Clare Market and Drury-Lane . Counc . When were they first in his Company ? Snafe . I ca n't tell he Month , but 't was before Christmas . We have been all of us in Company together several Times ; and I have heard him encourage them , and seen him make them merry with Eatables and Drinking . I may express the Words I suppose - it was to encourage them to go with him to the King of Prussia , for his Service . Counc . Was there any thing mentioned of the Time , in which they were to continue in the Prussian Service ? Snafe . Yes , he told them they must continue in the Service 3 Year ; and Davison and White were to have 10 l. each [ Text unreadable in original . ] at Hamburgh . They were not to have the Money here for Fear they should not go with him . He would not trust them ; that was the Reason they were to be paid there . Counc . Did you observe the Prisoner to give either of them any Money ? Snafe . Yes ; I saw him give White a Shilling , of which White told me the same Instant . Counc . What Security had they that the 10 l. should be paid them at Hamburgh ? Snafe . He gave them Notes under his Hand : I saw one of the Notes deliver 'd to Davison , by the Prisoner . I saw him write it , and then deliver it . They read it to me a little while after ; and the Purport of it was , that they were to receive 10 l. on their Arrival at Hamburgh . Counc . What was the Shilling given for ? Snafe . To enlist them , I take it . - Both Davison and White read their Notes to me , I did not see him give White his Note ; but I saw him deliver Davison 's to him , and they were both read to me . Counc . Should you know the Notes again if you was to see them ? Snafe . To the best of my Knowledge these are the Notes : I ca n't read ; but I believe they are the same . Counc . Was the Defendant present when they were read ? Snafe . No ; he was not . Counc . Does Davison go by any other Name ? Snafe . By some Title of his Brother , I have heard him call 'd Birk . Prisoner . This Witnesses 's Name is not Snafe , but Senett . Pray did you hear me seduce Birk or White , to enlist into the King of Prussia 's Service ? Snafe . I heard the Prisoner say he would give him 10 l. and the King of Prussia , and his Service , was named several Times . Counc . Do you know any thing of the Defendant 's delivering colour 'd Cloaths to Davison and White ? Snafe . Yes ; I saw him deliver a Snuff-colour 'd Coat to White , in my House . This is the Coat he deliver 'd to him ; and I saw him likewise deliver this other Coat to John Davison . These Cloaths were to disguise them , when they went on board , lest they should be discover 'd in their Regimentals . They were to go on board last Saturday was a Fortnight , at Night ; and he then gave them the Cloaths at my House , about 7 or 8 o'Clock that Evening . The Notes were given by the Prisoner the Day before . Prisoner . Have not you and I quarrell 'd of late ? Snafe . No ; he us 'd to be angry sometimes with me , and would tell me , that I neglected what he encouraged me to do , and did not get him tall Men . Prisoner . Have not you declar 'd you would be reveng 'd of me ? Snafe . No . John Davison , otherwise Brik . About the latter End of September , I became acquainted with the Prisoner ; We met him at Snafe 's House , in Windsor-Court , where he desir 'd my Comerade and I to come and drink a Bowl of Punch with him . Snafe and his Wife were present at the same Time . Counc . Did the Defendant propose any thing about your going beyond Sea ? Davison . Yes ; he desir 'd me several Times to see if I could get him any Men , 6 Feet high , or more ; and said , when they got to Hamburgh , they should be encourag 'd and rewarded . He spoke to my Comerade , White , upon the same Account , and desir 'd me to keep him in the same Mind ; for he had consented to go . Counc . Did he propose your going too ? Davison . Yes ; I was to go with them , but was to come back again ; tho ' this was only a Pretence ; for at the latter End of the Time , he gave me a Note of 10 l. as well as White , for my 3 Years Service in the King of Prussia 's Service , in his Guards . This was on the 30th of March . Counc . Produce the Note . Davison . This is the Note the Prisoner wrote , and deliver 'd to me . I set my Mark to it , after I deliver 'd it to Colonel Williamson . Counc . How came this Note to be made payable to David Birk ? Davison . I have a Brother by half Blood , of this Name , in Ireland , and most People that know him , call me by his Sur-name . His Name is Toby Birk . The David Birk , that is mentioned in the Note , is intended for my Name , and means me . They always call 'd me John Birk , except when I was at the Barracks , and then he call 'd me Davison . He gave me the Note in the Name of David Birk . Counc . What farther was done in Order to your going beyond Sea ? Davison . He contriv 'd so far , that my Comerade and I were to go away the first of April . We were to go down to Gravesend with the Evening Tide , and he gave us colour 'd Cloaths to go off in . After he had given us the Cloaths , he went down to St. Catherine 's , to learn what Time the Hamburgh Ship was to sail , in which we were to be put ; and he brought us Word , that the Ship would sail that Tide , and that we must go down to Gravesend that Afternoon . This is the Coat and Wastecoat he gave me to disguise myself in , that I might not be known to be a Soldier . I put the Cloaths on , but I discover 'd the Design in the Morning to Serjeant Philips , and desir 'd him to carry one of the Notes to Colonel Williamson , who came with some Men to Billingsgate : where the Colonel heard him say to us , - If you have either Honour or Honesty , come away directly ; because we had promis 'd to go along with him . I had one Shilling of him at first , a second he gave me to carry my Comerade White , and a third he gave me one Night , when I was a little longer than ordinary upon Guard . Counc . Was you present at any Time when any Conversation pass 'd between him and White , in Relation to his going into the Service of the King of Prussia . Davison . Yes ; White was to have so much a Week in the King of Prussia 's Guards , nine Shillings per Week , and ten Pounds as soon as he landed at Hamburgh ; this was his Promise to White , I do n't say he promised the same to me . Councel . Was you present when the Prisoner wrote the Promissory Note which he gave to White ? Davison . White had his Note given by the Prisoner before I had mine . I saw him write White 's , the whole Note was of the Prisoner 's own Hand-writing . I saw him write and deliver them both . The Notes were read . LONDON , March 30 , 1738 . `` I promise to pay to David Birk , or order , for `` Value received , the Sum of Ten Pounds , as `` soon as he is arrived in the City of Hamburgh ; `` and it is his own Will and Proposal , for three `` Years Service in the King of Prussia 's Guards . By Me , WILLIAM LAWRENCE . LONDON , March 30 , 1738. `` I promise to pay to John White , or order for `` Value received , the Sum of Ten Pounds , as `` soon as he arrives at the City of Hamburgh ; `` and according to his own Will and Proposal , `` to enter into the King of Prussia 's Service for `` three Years . WILLIAM LAWRENCE . Davison . Both these Notes were given us by the Prisoner , at the Bull-Head , in Peter-Street , Clare-Market . John White . I have known the Prisoner since Michaelmas last ; the very first Time of my being in his Company , was upon the Business of entering into the King of Prussia 's Guards ; upon this Account he daily treated me with Victuals and Drink , and was always reflecting upon his Majesty 's Service , telling me it was poor sorry Bread , and what rare Things were to be done in Prussia , but nothing under six Foot would do for him , una every Man that was so much above six Foot high , should have so much the more Pay . Councel . How many Meetings had you before you took the Notes ? White . Several ; we met twenty or thirty Times I believe , but about the latter End of March we made the Agreement , and for our Encouragement he gave us Notes on the 30th of March , for ten Pounds payable when we got to Hamburgh , and we were to go aboard the next Day . He told us he had got Provisions on board , and all Things proper , if we would proceed to the Vessel . In order to disguise me he gave me a colour 'd Coat , which I kept and have brought hither ; he gave Davison Cloaths likewise , I saw him fit them upon him , and we were to have gone aboard the 1st of April , at 8 o'Clock at Night , but I gave Information to my Serjeant in the Morning , and he went to Colonel Williamson , who sent a Guard from the Tower , and he was taken and carried before the Colonel . Councel . Who writ the Notes ? White . The Prisoner . Councel . Because 't is said in them , - that 't is your own Will and Proposal . White . We told him so to carry on the Scheme , and to find out his Roguery ; but he writ the Notes himself , and delivered them in my Presence . This is the very Note the Prisoner gave to me . Prisoner . Was you never deluded by Birk and Sennett to go abroad with them to Germany or France ? And did not they tell you they had been in Foreign Service before ? White . Davison and I intrigued all along in order to catch the Prisoner , and Birk spoke to me several Times on that Head , but between him and I he told me he had no Mind to go , nor should I go . We shew 'd a Disposition to go that we might deceive and detect him . Prisoner . Did not Sennet ( Snafe ) say he had a Disposition of Spight against me , concerning his Wife ? White , No , never in this World , nor Davison neither . John Philips . ( Serjeant . ) Davison and White are Soldiers in our Regiment . On the first of April , White came and enquired for Captain Parker , but he not being in the Way , his Servant came for me , and White told me that the Prisoner was going to carry him to Prussia , with his Comrade . He gave me the Ten Pound Note which the Prisoner had given him , and I carried it to Colonel Williamson . This is the very Note , I read it over and over , and have had it in my Pocket a Day or two . Colonel Williamson , when the Prisoner was before him , shewed him the Note , and he took hold of one End of it , but before he would let it go again , the Colonel was forced to hold a Candle to his Fingers . He was asked , what was the Reason of his giving those Notes ? at first he would not resolve him , but afterwards he said the Men obliged him to it . Colonel Williamson . The Prisoner was brought before me in the Evening the 1st of April . This Serjeant came to me with one of these Notes , and told me what Design was going forwards , that a Man had enlisted two Grenadiers for the King of Prussia 's Service . The Note I saw was full and distinct , therefore I thought it was very proper to look after this Fellow . The Serjeant told me the Men were to go away at 8 o'Clock that Evening , but they were honest and had given him this Information . He asked for a few Men that they might go and take him ; I told him , I not only would let him have Men , but I would go with them myself ; so I took a Serjeant and a File of Musquetteers , and planted them in the dark at Billingsgate , where they were to take Water . After we had waited some little Time , Davison came and told us , the Prisoner would be there presently , for his Time was come ; he had then this brown Coat on , which has been produced here . About 8 o'Clock I perceived the Guard running , I pursued and caught him , just as they overtook him near Thomas-street by Billingsgate . When he was before me , both the Notes were produced , and I asked some Questions about them , he humm 'd and haw 'd , and said they were a Parcel of Rogues . But , says I , here are Notes ( and shewing him one ) is this your Hand-Writing ? Let me see it , says he ; I would not part with it out of my Hand , but I let him take hold of one End of the Note , and asked him again , if that was his Writing ? He would make no answer , so I bid him let go the Note ; he would not let it go , therefore I was forced to put the Candle to his Hand , and when he felt the Flame he quitted his Hold . On this full Evidence I committed him to Newgate . Councel . Was it before or after this , that he said she was obliged to give the Men these Notes Serjeant Philips . It was after the Colonel had got the Note out of his Hand While we waited for the Prisoner at Billingsgate , I heard a Man say , - Now , if you have either Honour or Honesty , come along . I thought this must be the Man , so we all endeavour 'd to take him , but he took to his Heels and run up a little Lane towards Thames-Street , the Guard ran after him , and somebody running against him threw him down ; before he could get up again we took him . DEFENCE . Prisoner . I have fourteen or fifteen Witnesses to prove that Birk and Sennett have sent Men abroad these three Years , and that I did not instigate them to do this Thing . Patrick M'Cauly . I live in Sennet 's ( Snafe 's ) House , and have seen Davison and White with Lawrence eating and drinking there . Snafe kept the House , - we call him Sennett . I never knew the Prisoner encourage a Man , but Sennett employ 'd me once , - with Submission to your Lordship and the Honourable Jury , I am a Taylor , and he employ 'd me to alter an old Suit of Cloaths once , and they were to be done against 6 o'Clock in the Evening , and he said I should be paid . When they were done , I carry 'd them down to Sennett in the Kitchen , the Prisoner was there , but he did not employ me . Sennett helped the Cloaths upon Birk 's Back , and White asked for a Room up-stairs to dress himself in . Counc . Have not you seen Lawrence the Prisoner there , in Company with Davison and White , when they were eating and drinking ? M'Cauly Not together . - I have seen them together , but I do n't know whether they were in the same Company ; I do n't know whether they join 'd Company ; - there are several Seats in the Kitchen . When White ask 'd for a Room to dress himself in , Snafe cry 'd , - Bl - d and W - ds , take the Key of the Cellar , and dress yourself there . This was about a Fortnight ago , but I did not ( can not ) mention the Day . Counc . Recollect whether the Prisoner was there . M'Cauly . I believe he was . - I am not sure . - To the best of my Knowledge I saw him there . - I am not sure - I ca n't say directly he was there . Counc . Did you hear any thing of the Reason why the Cloaths were sitted on the Soldiers ? M'Cauly . I do n't know , - but I smelt something , and Snafe said I should get 5 Guineas , if I could procure a tall Man . I brought one Henry Carpenter to his House , and Snafe measur 'd him , - he measur 'd 6 Feet high in his Shoes . Carpenter told him , he could bring him another Man , taller than himself , and Snafe said , they would do very well together ; but Carpenter did not like his Face , so he came no more to him . Nathan Riley . I am a Peruke-maker , and seeing the Prisoner frequently in Snafe 's House , I got acquainted with him , and have known them to have several Quarrels , which as far as I understood , were from Jealousy of his Wife . Once I met him , and he told me , that the Prisoner and his own Wife had abus 'd him , and he was going to swear against him . I have heard Snafe often say , he would be even with him , by Night or by Day , and that he would be one upon his Taw , swearing bloody Oaths . I have heard the Prisoner warn Davison from keeping Snafe Company , and tell him , that he ( Snafe ) was a spunging , lurking Companion It was entirely out of jealousy , and there was an Uneasiness between them . Snafe and Davison deserted out of France . Patrick Riley . My Wife and Snafe 's Wife are Brother and Sister 's Children . Snafe has often complained to me about the Prisoner , that he had kept his Wife out , and that he would be even with him . The Prisoner and he have had Words together upon the same Occasion ; and he ( Snafe ) has told the Prisoner , he would be reveng 'd of him if he sold himself to the Devil . Counc . Do you know one Birmingham ? Riley . Yes ; several . Counc . But do you know that Birmingham that was in Newgate ? Riley Yes ; I knew him at Clerkenwell ; he is a Turner , a noted Man . Counc . Was that he who was in Newgate ? Riley No ; I never knew any Birmingham in Newgate . This Day Fortnight , ( the Beginning of April ) I was at Work , and the Prisoner came and told me , he was going out of Town . He ow 'd me some Money , so went to Snafe 's House to settle . This was about 7 o'Clock in the Evening , and they were going to light Candles ; the Prisoner told me he was going out of Town . Counc . And did not you wonder at his going out of Town at 7 o'Clock at Night ? Riley While I was there , he said to a Porter that was with him , - Come let us go , - we shall be too late . I do n't want any Body to come ; if they do n't come , I wo n't stay . The Porter had something in his Apron , but I do n't know what . Lawrence and I had a Pot of Beer in the Entry ; I took a Drink , and he went away down Russel-Court . William Connor . I never saw the Prisoner before in my Life ; but I know Birk , ( or Davison : ) I enter 'd with him on board the Windsor Man of War , as a Land-man . I was sick on board , and was sent to St. Thomas 's . From thence I went to Newtoner 's Lane , where Birk lodg 'd , and I lay with him 3 or 4 Nights ; this was 3 Years ago last Winter . While I lay with him , I had the soul Disease , and he advised me to go to France for a Cure ; telling me that Soldiers were punish 'd here for the least Fault , but there they are punish 'd for nothing but stealing . Birk , alias Davison . I do n't know that ever I saw this Man in all my Life . Connor . And I never saw the Prisoner in all my Life . Margaret Riley . I am Riley 's the ( Shoemaker 's ) Wife , and heard Snafe say , he had dogg 'd his Wife to an Alehouse with the Prisoner ; that he would be reveng 'd of him by Night or by Day ; and would not sleep 'till he had him in Irons . Snafe is my Relation , - I should not hurt him , - but he said he had got these Men , Davison and White , and would oblige the Prisoner to give them his Note , to get them on the other side the Water ; and as the Prisoner was an Englishman , not an Irishman , the 2 Men would trust him . 'T is all thro ' Jealousy this is done . Snafe told me farther , that he was to go along with the Prisoner , and the 2 Men ; and when they got on the other side , Snafe was to pay the Prisoner again . Mary Sennett , otherwise Snafe . I am that Man 's ( Snafe 's ) Wife ; and I was going one Day last Week , - I ca n't remember the Day , - thro ' Vinegar Yard , and meeting Davison , he and I went to the Thistle and Crown ; I ask 'd him how he could be so vile , as to do such a Thing as this against the Prisoner ? he told me , He was heartily sorry for it ; and if I could raise Snafe and him a Guinea , they would both go out of the Kingdom ; for , said he , I am loth to have a Hand in the Blood of the Innocent ; and I would not have done it , had not I been persuaded to it . The Prisoner and Davison have often been at my House . Counc . You say the Prisoner and Davison , and White , have often been in Company together at your House ? Sennett . No ; never but once . I sell Ale , and a Glass of Two-penn ; but when White was with them , they had a Bowl of Punch ; I believe that was a Month ago . Another Time , White and Davison , and Sennett , were at my House , ( but Lawrence was not there then ) and White complained of his being affronted in the Barracks , by the Corporal ; and before he would live such a Life , and be call 'd Irish Villain , he would go any where . They both said , they would rather serve the Turk than K. G - . Counc . Do you know any Thing of the Prisoner 's preparing to go abroad a Fortnight ago ? Sennett . Yes ; and I remember his being at our House that Night . Patrick Riley and he drank at the Door ; there was a Porter with him , and he was in haste to be gone . - I have one thing more about Birk . - About a Month ago he told me , that my Husband and he had been abroad , and says he to me , if you knew the Nature of foreign Countries you would go too ; and if you will pretend to be a Protestant , and will turn Roman , you will make a Purse of Money . I ask 'd Patrick M'Cauly about it , and he said he got 55 l. by this Means , before he got to Rome . Francis Gibbon . About 5 or 6 Months ago , I heard Sennett and his Wife disputing , because he had flung up his Pay , that he might get Men for the K. of Prussia . Glynn Bray . I was one Day at Sennett 's House , to drink a Glass of Gin , my Wife was with me ; and she and I falling out , Sennett cry 'd to me , G - d d - n it , come along to France , and I will provide for you . When you are got to France , I 'll provide a better Master for you than ever you had in your Life . I am a Gentleman 's Servant , and came out of Place about a Month ago ; but I was afraid he would sell me like a Cow or a Horse , so I avoided the Fellow 's Company . Patrick M'Cauly I have been in the French Service myself , Sennett was a Trooper there , and Birk was a Soldier . Eliz . Davis . I know nothing but - I 'm upon Oath , and will speak Truth . Last Saturday was se'enight I met this Man Sennett in the Street , and he told me his Wife was gone to Lawrence in Newgate , and that he would be reveng 'd on them both . I told him it was a vile thing in him to take such Exceptions , and swear so . G - d d - n it , says he , I wou 'd not wish for a Million of Money that I was concern 'd in the Action , for bringing this upon Lawrence . I had but very little Acquaintance with Sennett , and had not known him long ; but he said he was sorry he had done the Thing . Michael Luttuych . If I was to dye this Moment , it will be my Opinion , this Contrivance is owing to Sennett 's Jealousy . Sometime ago he came and demanded to talk to me about Lawrence 's having us 'd him ill ; and he said his Wife was a Bitch . I can not say I know any thing ill of Sennett ; but I believe this Affair proceeds from pure Jealousy . Counc . But do you think that Birk , ( Davison ) and White , who have no Wives to be jealous of , would work themselves up , and perjure themselves , because Sennett is jealous ? Luttwyel . As to that I ca n't say . Birk must degenerate very much from that noble Family in Ireland , to which he is related , if he does so Col. Williamson . That very Man , under his own Hand , recommended Birk as a very honest Man . Counc . - to Mary Sennett . Look upon that Coat and Wastcoat . Sennett . I bought them myself of M'Cauly The other Coat I know nothing of ; but I saw Sennett give it to White , and heard him bid White go down into the Cellar and put it on . Counc . Do n't you know your Husband had Money , upon this Account , from the Prisoner ? Sennett . I know of no more than 2 Half-Guineas , and that Money I sent my Husband to ask him for . - 'T was part of a Debt of 5 Guineas which he ow 'd me . As to the Cloaths , they had been in the House before ; my Husband dusted them , and the 2 Men put them on , while the Prisoner stood at the Door ; and they 3 went away half an Hour before the Prisoner . Counc . Did not you hear the Prisoner say - Come make haste , we shall be too late ? Sennett . No ; only - Come let us go . Thomas Hanning . Never heard of the Prisoner 's being concern 'd in Affairs of this Kind before . Capt . Carr . Gave an Account of the Behaviour of Davison and White as Soldiers , and said he believ 'd them to be very honest Men . Snafe , alias Sennett . What the Witnesses have sworn , with Relation to my saying the Prisoner was Innocent , and to my being sorry for being concerned in this Prosecution , is all false upon my Oath . I may have said I would be even with him to my Comerade , but it was because he often abus 'd me for not getting him Men . I never had a Word with him in my Life about my Wife .

I was last Tuesday to hear the Rehearsal at St. Paul 's , and when it was over , I endeavour 'd to avoid the Crowd , by going through Cannon Alley , in Pater-noster-Row . In the Alley I was stopp 'd by 2 Men , who push 'd me close against the Prisoner . Before I could get away , I felt her lift up the Side of my Hoop , and put her Hand into my Pocket . This Gentleman ( Mr. Addy ) was looking at the same out of his Window , and call 'd out to me , - Madam , your Pocket is pick 'd . I put my Hand into my Pocket , and found I had lost 8 s. 6 d. I brought 11 s. 6 d. out with me , but I had no more than a Half-Crown and a Six-pence left : Mr. Addy told me he knew the Woman , and if I would step into his House , he would go and take her ; and he went out , and took her accordingly . She was carry 'd before the Lord Mayor , but she was not search 'd ; for my Lord imagin 'd she had her Receivers about her , and that it would be to no Purpose to search her . I felt her Hand , and cry 'd at the same Time - What , are you picking Pockets here ! Mr. Addy . I was looking out of my Window to see the Crowd at the Rehearsal , and had observ 'd the Prisoner , with the Assistance of her 2 Fellows , to have pick 'd a great many Pockets that Morning : But this Lady was robb 'd under my very Window . I observ 'd the 2 Men to shove the Gentlewoman against the Prisoner , and saw her put her Hand into her Pocket , and afterwards clap something into her own . I was positive she took Money out of this Gentlewoman 's Pocket , and put it into her own ; so I told her , if she would Prosecute her , I would take her , for I knew her . She had been an Hour and Half , or 2 Hours , about the Alley that Morning , and had pick 'd a great many Pockets . Prisoner . Then why did not you call out before ? Mr. Addy . Because that was at a Distance - She was hurrying and picking Pockets as fast as she could , at a Distance ; but this was under my Window . Mary Read . I was with Mrs. Rowley at this Time . The Prisoner and her Fellows stopp 'd me first , and held me for some Time ; but I had emptied my Pockets before I came out , so they let me go , and stopp 'd her ; she was close behind me . I heard Mr. Addy call out to Mrs. Rowley , and tell her , the Prisoner had pick 'd her Pocket . Prisoner . I was in a Shop when that Man came up and accused me , and I offer 'd to be searched . I told the People I had 7 s. 6 d. and a Guinea in my Pocket , and if I had any more , 't was the Lady 's Mr. Ashly With Relation to her asserting he was in the Shop when she was seiz 'd , 't is false . At the very Time he seiz 'd her , she was going to pick Doctor Best 's Lady 's Pocket , and I call 'd out to her . I have known her for a Pick-pocket these 5 Years , and saw her pick 20 Pockets that Day . She is so well known , that I could have brought a Dozen People to have prov 'd this , if I had imagin 'd it would been necessary . Mr. Addy . Her Janizaries have been with me since she was taken up , and offer 'd me Money to keep out of the Way , that the Thing might be dropp 'd before the Grand Jury .

March 12 . David Castella . About 10 o'Clock on Sunday Night , March 12 . I was coming down the Strand with another young Man , and there being a Burying at the Corner of Catherine-street , and several Branch-lights to attend it , I went thro ' the Crowd , and my Friend went round the Coaches . When he was gone , the Prisoner laid hold of my right Arm , and I got loose from him twice , but the 3d Time he seiz 'd me , he held me so fast to his Breast , that it was with the utmost Difficulty I freed myself from him . As soon as I was disengag 'd I felt for my Watch , and it was gone . I ask 'd him the Reason of his laying hold of me , and imagin 'd he had some Evil in his Breast ; but he made no Answer at all , only held me fast . While I was struggling with him , I felt a Man behind me ; and I suppose either the Prisoner , or some of his Confederates , then got my Watch , for there were several in Company with him , tho ' the Prisoner only assaulted me . Prisoner . Why did not you call out to the People that attended the Funeral ? Castella . I was in Fear , and apprehended that most of the Mob about him consisted of his Confederates , I was afraid of being knock 'd on the Head . The Day before he went to offer Bail before a Judge , he sent me Word , I should have 3 Guineas , if I would not object to his Bail . Prisoner . Did not I tell you where I liv 'd ? Castella . When he was gone before the Justice , he said he kept a Cork cutter 's Shop , the Corner of the Old-Bailey Gate . Prisoner . Did not I go with you before the Justice without a Constable ? Castella . As soon as he was out of the Mob , I took him , and told him , I had lost my Watch while he held me . You joke , says he . I told him he should go before a Justice , and he said , he had rather go without a Constable , than be knock 'd down , and forc 'd to go Prisoner . How many People might there be about the Burying ? Castella . About 30 or 40 , besides the Mourners . They were going into the last Coach , when this happen 'd . Peter Drummond . On the 13th of March , I was with the Prisoner in the Round-House . There was a Man call 'd me out , and desir 'd he might drink with Castella and me : We went to a publick House , and he offer 'd him 2 Guineas and the Watch to make up the Matter , because the Prisoner was but just come into Business . Prisoner . When I went with him before the Justice , the Justice would have nothing to say to me , because I did not come before him in charge of a Constable ; upon which I went with Castella to the Constable of the Night .

Last Monday Night I was going up Holborn and met that Gentlewoman there , and another with her . So Countryman , said they , where are you going ? Why Home , says I , where should I go ? Go along with us , says one of them . What should I go along with you for , I ca n't Kiss you ? Will you bung your Eyes , said I ? Yes , if I pleas 'd they said ; and so they carry 'd me to one Mrs. Wests House , - I do n't know what Street 't is in , not I , - I am but a stranger here . But that woman there , and I , went in and drank ; I saw none but she and the Landlady . When we had drank together a while , I call 'd for the Landlady to give me Change for the Liquor , but I never got my Change of her ; when she came in , she said to the Prisoner , bilk him - make the best of him ; so we drank together , and she grew mighty familiar , - more familiar than I thought she should be , - stand further off says I , - I am afraid of you . Presently after this the Landlady came in , and put out the Candles , and pushing me out of Doors , I had like to have broke my Shins . When I was out of the House they run me up against the Wall of a Brew-House , and left me . I found my Money was gone , so I ran roaring and hallooing out for a Watchman , and at last a Watchman found me , and carry 'd me Home , Next Morning I was a little uneasy about my Money , and I told the Folks how I had been serv 'd , and that I had lost 9 l. 3 s. What 's her Name said they ? Her Name , says I , - why I do n't know her Name , - only they call 'd her Peg . O ! says one of them , we can help you to Peg again , and so they carry 'd me from one House to to'ther House , and at last we found Peg at a Pawnbroker 's redeeming her Cloaths out of Pawn , with my Money I suppose . I ran for a Warrant to take her up , and when I return 'd , the People told me she had confess 'd her taking my Money , and she had return 'd a Guinea and a half , a 36 Shilling-piece , and Half-a-Crown . When she was before the Justice , she own 'd the Fact again , and upon searching her , we found another Guinea in her Snuff-Box , and 13s in her Pocket , which she own 'd was Part of my Money . Some of the Gold ( she said ) she had chang 'd to redeem her Things , and three Guineas her Landlady took from her , for her Share . She said she took it out of my Fob-Pocket , - I do n't know how she did it , not I , - 't was in my Fob , in a green silk Wallet . I have no more to say , - not I. Prisoner . Do you swear I pick 'd your Pocket ? Robins . Yes ; and you know you did . I did not miss it 'till they push 'd me out of the House . There was none but she in my Company ; the Landlady only brought in the Liquor , and I felt for my Money and had it as I went into the House . Geo Thompson . The Prisoner was brought to my House , by some People , to whom she had return 'd the 36 Shilling-piece , with a Guinea and half , and Half a Crown ; the Money was paid in my Backside , - my Back-side in the Yard . While she was before the Justice we found 13 s. in her Pocket , and a Guinea in her Snuff-Box . She own 'd she took the Money she is charg 'd with out of his Pocket ; and put the rest into it again . Robins . No ; she did not take all , - for I had 14 l. in my Pocket . She took what she pleas 'd , and left me the rest in the Wallet . Prisoner . Where did you go to see what Money was lost ? Robins . To my Inn . I could not tell my Money over in the Street , - in the Dark . Prisoner . Was you asleep in the House ? Robins . Asleep , - no ; nor I was not asleep . Prisoner . Was you drunk or sober ? Robins . Sober - why I was not very sober - nor I was not very fuddled . Prisoner to the Constable . Was he drunk or sober ? Thompson . He was drunk . She own 'd she took the Money ( before the Justice ) out of his Pocket , and said nothing in her Excuse . Prisoner . Did you give me the Purse to tell the Money over ? Robins . No - no - no - I did not like you so well . I was only drinking there - that 's all : she was greater with me than I desir 'd . We had 3 Bottles of Ale , and I paid the Reckoning - 3 Shillings and 6 Pence Joseph Stollard . The Prisoner confess 'd the Fact in my hearing ; but she said the Countryman and she had 3 Bottles of Ale , and 2 half Pints of Gin . She said , her Landlady charg 'd her to bilk him , when she put them together . Prisoner . How was it possible for me to put the Purse into your Fob again ? Robins . How was it possible ? Why how was it possible for you to take it out ? We sat upon the Bed together ; but I do n't know any Business she had with my Fob . Prisoner . You ca n't swear but your Money might drop out of your Fob . Robins . Ca n't I ! - yes , but I can tho ' . Guilty , Felony only . [ Transportation .

He was a second Time charg 'd , by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest . Daniel Clay . Gave an Account , that the Prisoner , about the Time the Child began to be ill , had lain with him almost a Week . He and the Prisoner lying at the Head , and the Child and it 's Mother at the Feet of the same Bed . That he was that Week often there in the Day-time , and frequently lay down upon the Bed , when the Child was upon it . That he own 'd he was clapp 'd , and the Witness went with him to a Doctor 's , and the Medicines were taken , by the Prisoner , at his ( Clay 's ) Room . He farther said , that the Prisoner had lain down , at the same Time when both he and his Wife had gone out , and left the Child asleep , upon the Bed . That he had but one Room , and the Bed was in one Corner of it , in a Place like a Closet : And that he never heard any violent Outcries of the Child ; only when it eas 'd Nature , it complain 'd and cry 'd our , in a particular Manner . Elizabeth Clay , gave much the same Account ; adding , that the Child 's Complaints began about the latter End of the Week the Prisoner lay with them : and she spoke like wise to the Appearance of the Injury the Child had received , and the Consequences of it . Ann Harvey depos 'd , she carry 'd the Child to several Surgeons ; one of which told her , nothing would do it good but a Salivation . Mr. Wiseman depos 'd , That he saw the Child the Wednesday before it dy 'd , and perceiv 'd that there was no Help for it ; a Gangrene and Mortification being begun . He said , he did not know , but as the Child liv 'd at a Gin-shop , and had been us 'd to drink Gin , that might occasion a Scalding of Urine , and the Disorder might proceed to that Height , for want of proper Care . Mr. Lawrence depos 'd , That he view 'd the Child , Feb. 22. and found a visible Laceration , and a violent Inflammation , tending to a Mortification , and all the Symptoms of the Venereal Disease . Mr. Atkinson saw the Child after its Death ; he spoke to the Laceration and Mortification , and said , it had had a violent Gonorrhaea upon it . Mary Inwood was of Opinion , The Child had been poison 'd in its own Nastiness ; and said , Mrs Clay had told her , she had no Suspicion that the Prisoner had injur 'd her Child . William Brown , a Surgeon , depos 'd , 'T was his Belief the Disorder proceeded from a Heat of Urine , and bad Nursing . Adam Maccormet , William Nathan , and John Smedley depos 'd , That Clay and his Wife ( being Shoemakers ) sold Gin to their Brethren of the Craft ; and gave a surprizing Account of their continuing at Clay 's House , Day after Day , drinking this Liquor ; of which the Child partook , 'till it often tumbled about the Floor . That the fudling Bout held a Week , during which Time either Clay or his Wife were always at home in their Shed , or Lodging ; and that they were often taken by the Head ( or drunk with the Liquor ) themselves , as well as they - ( their Customers . ) The Surgeons depos 'd , It was impossible the Child could be injur 'd in the Manner they found her , without making loud and terrible Complaints . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 73. Lydia Clark , of St. Andrew Holbourn , was indicted for privately stealing an Indian Purse , value 2 d. and 35 Guineas , from the Person of William Pullen , Nov. 30 . Pullen . On the 30th of Nov . I met a Woman in Holborn , and went with her to Mary Arnold 's in Stichbourn-Court in Holborn : After we had drank , the Woman I brought in with me ( which I verily believe is the Prisoner ) ask 'd me to give her something , and I gave her a Shilling . Then she told me , there was a lusty Woman at the Door , ( who is the Evidence here ) and I might see how I lik 'd her . Upon this the Evidence came in , and the other ( I believe the Prisoner is the Woman ) jump 'd out of the Door at once . The Prisoner having sat with her Leg in my Lap , I suspected she had robb 'd me ; and upon searching for my Purse , I found it was so . I immediately complain 'd to Mrs. Arnold , that I was robb 'd , and went to the Door , where the People in the Court told me , that 't was Lydia Clark that I had carry 'd into the House , and they sent for a Constable . I stood a while at the Door ; then Mrs. Arnold shut us out . Upon this we went to Mr. De Veil for a Warrant , and when we came back , we found Arnold and the Evidence in the House , with a Woman crowded all on a heap , with a Pipe in her Mouth . The next Morning I was inform 'd , that the Woman thus disguised was the Person that robb 'd me Upon this Information I took up the Evidence , who discover 'd the Prisoner . I am sure I had the Money when I went into the Room ; for I took it then out of my Breeches Pocket , and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket , as the safest Place . When I carry 'd the Prisoner into the House , she was dress 'd very gay , in a velvet Hood and Manteel ; but when I came with the Warrant , she was wrapped up in Rags , and had a Pipe in her Mouth . Mary Wheatly . On the 30th of Nov. Lydia Clark and I , agreed to walk together at Night . Between Fetter-lane and Middle Row , in Holborn , I stopp 'd to speak to a Man , and while I was talking to him , she pick'd-up Mr. Pullen . I miss 'd her , and judg 'd she was gone to Mr.Arnold 's with him , So I follow 'd , and Mrs. Arnold told me , Lydia had carry 'd a Cull up stairs . I went up to the Chamber Door , and Lydia cry 'd , here 's a fine large Woman , see & c. & c. - and immediately she jump 'd up , and ran down Stairs . The Man complain 'd at that Instant that she had robb 'd him , and I bid him follow her . He went to the Door and we fastn 'd it upon him . Upon that he made an Out-cry , and Mr. Oatley and Mr. Holley came to his Assistance , and demanded the Door to be open 'd . We refus 'd ; and knew they had no authority to break it open ; they knew the same , therefore they resolv 'd to leave some body at the Door , while others went for a Warrant , because the Neighbours had declar 'd , that the Prisoner was hid in the House . While they were gone for the Warrant , one Mrs. Dunckley who was then in the House , was frighted , and insisted upon being let out , before the Warrant came ; so we open 'd the Door , but the Persons who kept Guard on the outside , would neither let her go out , nor suffer us to shut the Door again . So when they return 'd with the Warrant , they found the Door open . When the Prisoner jump 'd out of the Room from the Prosecutor , she did not go out of the House , but ran into the Cellar , and when the Street Door was shut upon him , she came up with an old sort of a stuff Purse in her Hand , and 't was spotted with black and yellow , had long Strings , with Tassels at the Bottom . The Prisoner told 35 Guineas out of it , into Arnold 's Lap , and she put it into a Bag , and hid it over the Kitchen Door . I saw the Money , and remember a crooked Guinea in particular . Then they burnt the Purse , and the Prisoner undress 'd herself , and put a double Clout about her Head , and ty 'd an old Handkerchief and a colo r 'd Apron about her , and sat down with a Pipe in her Mouth , that she might not be known . When the Prosecutor return 'd with the Warrant , the House was search 'd , but they did not find the Money , or know the Prisoner in her Disguise . When the Hurry was over , I went home to my Lodgings , and in about half an Hour , the Prisoner and one Mr. Clark ( that she lives with ) came to me , and said , they had got all the Blunt , meaning the whole 35 Guineas ; and he told it over before me and her . They wanted to lye with me , but I refus 'd it ; so they talk 'd of going to Lawyer Grimes 's . When I was taken up , I insisted upon Mr. Clark 's returning the Money , and it was return 'd to Mr. Pullen - all - except a little that was allow 'd for Favours ; but 't was upon Condition he should not Prosecute . Mr Chamberlain gave an Account , that Mr . Clerk return 'd 30 Guineas of the Money , and that the Felony had been compounded , had not he prevented it , and caus 'd the Money to be paid into the Constable 's Hands . Richard Bunce , at the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes in the Strand , swore , That the Evidence had said , she was sorry for what she had done ; and that she was influenc 'd by vile People to do it . Richard Swift , Mary Swift , - Arrowsmith , Charles Cole , William Munyard , a Hosier , Jane Waters and Henry Emps gave the Prisoner a good Character . Jane Waters , Sarah White , Mary Cummins , Catherine Hurt , and Mary Curtis , gave the Evidence the Character of an ill Woman , and that she went by the Name of Blaspheming Moll . Cummins likewise depos 'd , that Ezekiel Waters and Beck Green had been the Occasion of the Evidence 's appearing against the Prisoner , and that they had declar 'd , they would hang her , or Transport her . Cath Hurt depos 'd , that Ezekiel Waters , and Beck Green , took the Prisoner up in her House , after they had invited her thither to drink a Dish of Tea with them . Mary Curtis farther declar 'd , that the Evidence must be a bad Woman , for she had told her , she had lain in the Temple with the late Mr . Car . Acquitted .
