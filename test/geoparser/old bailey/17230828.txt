She was positive that Carty had stabb 'd the Deceased before he got the Prisoner 's Sword , and attack 'd Carty . The Information of the Deceased before he died was read in Court , which was much to the same Purpose with the former Evidence ; and other Evidences confirm 'd some of the Circumstances . But it not appearing that the Prisoner had any Design to kill the Deceased , but that it was done by Carty without being encourag 'd to it by the Prisoner , he was acquitted . Henry Kirk , and William Allen , of St. Andrew 's Holborn , were indicted for assaulting George Briton on the Highway , and taking from him a Cane , value 3 s. the 22d of July last .

The Prosecutor depos 'd , That he rented a Piece of Ground of the Prisoner Husband and Father , who was then in the Fleet : That having cut the Hay , it was carried off by the Prisoners . It appear 'd by the Evidence , That the Hay was taken off the Ground , not feloniously , but on Account of a Dispute concerning the Legality of the Title .

John White , of St. Dunstan 's in the West , was indicted for breaking open the Chambers of Mr. John Borrett , Gentleman , and feloniously stealing 100 Guineas , 5 Moidores , and other Money , to the Value of 174 l. 2 s. 6 d. the Property of John Packer , the 9th of August . Mr. Packer depos 'd , That he being Clerk to Mr. Barrett , a Master in Chancery , Mr. Borrett told him he design 'd to go out of Town , and order 'd him to make up his Accounts : That he did so , and brought the Money to the Chambers in Symond 's Iwn upon the Day mentioned in the Indictment , in order to have paid it to Mr. Borrott ; but Mr. Borrett being then busy , defer 'd the Receiving it till the next Morning . That then he lock 'd up the Money in a Scrutoure in the Study , lock 'd up the Drawers , the Study Door , and Chamber-Door , and went away about 8 a-Clock , and went to the Tavern . That a Messenger came to him about ten , and he went and found all the Doors broken open , and the Drawers set scattering about the Room , but the Money gone ; and that there was in that Next of Drawers a Bank Bill of 20 l. and a South-Sea Bond of 50 l. which were left in the Drawers where the Money was , but knew not who committed the Fact . But upon enquiring afterwards , began to have some suspicion of the Prisoner , who was a Clerk in the Office ; for that whereas he this Evidence keeping one Key of the Chambers , and the Laundress another , he had heard that after the Prisoner was gone from the Office , and himself had lock 'd up the Chambers , the Prisoner did get the Laundress 's Keys , and went into the Chambers , under Pretence of setching a Letter that he had left there ; though it was not Post-Night ; it did not appear that he had any Occasional so to do : And also hearing that he had also been seen to go from the Chambers a second Time , at about half an Hour after 9 a Clock , and on Account of a Hammer found in the Chambers . Rebeckah Golding depos 'd , That she delivered the Keys to the Prisoner at about half an Hour past 8 a-Clock that Night the Robbery was committed , that he return 'd the Keys in about a quarter of an Hour : That she went afterwards , about a Quarter before 9 , and found the Door but single lock 'd , and she shut the Windows , and double lock 'd the Door , and that about to she went again , and found the Chamber Door , and Study Door broken open , the Hinges having been taken off , and the Drawers lying scattered about . Here the Prisoner ask 'd the Evidence if these Keys did not use to lye publickly among other Keys in a Bunch , in the Affidavit Office : To which she reply 'd they did , but were not withstanding very safe , there being none but reputable Gentlemen , and that no Body used these Keys but she Prisoner and the Master . She added , that at 10 a-Clock the Windows were fast barred , only 2 Nails drawn in one of the Hinges of the Shutter , and that in the Morning she found a Hammer lying in the Window , near the Prisoner 's Desk . John Spires , the Porter depos 'd , That at 10 a-Clock he was called by the Laundress , and when he went with her into the Chamber , he see the Lock of the Door had been unskrew 'd and taken off , and the inner Door lying all on one side , and the Drawers standing in several Places , whereupon he went and acquainted Mr. Packer , and he came and missed his Money . Jams Spires depos 'd , That as he was sitting in the Entry the Prisoner came down the Steps from the Master 's Chambers , at about half an Hour after 9 a-Clock that Night , and went out the back Way towards Fetter-Lane , or Bond 's Stables . George Essex depos 'd , He saw the Prisoner in the Court after 9 a Clock , and the Prisoner own 'd he was looking into the Cellar for some of his Acquaintance , but seeing none there , he went home . There were also 2 Hammers produc 'd in Court one that was found in the Chamber the next Morning , which was supposed to have been borrowed by the Prisoner , of one Mr. Peed , who lodg 'd in Mr. White 's House , and the other one , that some Time after had been given by Mr. White 's Maid to Mr. Peed 's Servant ; when he sent for it instead of his own . Mr. Peed depos 'd . That the Hammer produced in Court , and sworn to be found in the Chambers , was very much like his Hammer , but he would not positively swear to it , but his Servant was more positive , having taken Notice of its being mark 'd with a P cut in it , and that when she went to Mr. White 's Maid for Mr. Peed 's Hammer , did take Notice to Mr. Peed , that the Hammer Mr. White 's Maid had given her , was not Mr. Peed 's Hammer , differing in the Handle , tho ' there had been a P burnt upon it . The Prisoner pleaded , that there had been tampering , as to the Hammer , and called two Evidences , who depos 'd , That a Woman came to them , and enquir 'd very pressingly , if they knew the Owner of that Hammer , and upon their saying they knew not the Owner , was told by this Woman , that they did not know the Value of that Hammer , it was worth to Guineas , and ask 'd how they would like that Hammer and 10 l. at the End of it . The Jury having considered the Evidence , acquitted him . Humphrey Anger , of the Parish of Hornsey , was indicted for assaulting Martin Lewen , Gentleman , on the High Way , and taking from him 7 Guineas , and 16 Shillings in Silver , the 23d of December , 1720 . Martin Lewen , the City Marshal depos 'd , That as he was riding to Muzzle-Hill , the 23d of December last was two Years , being about the Middle of the Lane between Highgate and Hornsey , about five a Clock in the Evening , he saw two Men on Foot before him , with their Hats slapping , in browaish colour 'd Coats , and in such Posture , that he was apprehensive they were Foot-pads , and had some Thoughts of turning back ; but at last resolving to venture , went forward , and as soon as he came up to them , they both flew at his House , and Dyer caught hold of his Bridle , and the Prisoner took hold of his Leg , and was going to throw him off from his House , but he desired him not to do it , for he would voluntarily alight , and did immediately , he having almost Slung him off , and after clapping Pistols to his Breast , which were large Pistols with Brass Caps , he desired them to take away the Pistols , and he would give them what Money he had ; he gave to Dyer 7 Guineas , that Dyer kneel 'd down on his Knees and broke off the Button of his Breeches , and finding 16 or 17 Shillings that he had forgotten in the Hurry , they damn 'd him , and threatned to shoot him for telling them a Lye , and rattled their Pistols very much about him : That having consented to let him go , Dyer was for cutting his Horse 's Bridle , but he prevail 'd upon them not to do it , the Lane being dirty and so he left them . Mr. Lewen being ask 'd whether it was light enough for him to distinguish the Person ; he reply 'd it was , and though he would not swear positively , he did verily believe Anger was one of those that robb 'd him . The Prisoner at the Beginning of his Tryal desired that Dyer might be put out of the Court , and not hear what the Prosecutor depos 'd , which was done , and being afterwards call 'd in , depos 'd as the prosecutor had done , varying in no Circumstance , except that whereas the Prosecutor thought it was Dyer that took the Silver out of his Pocket , he depos 'd it was Anger that took it , and added , that Anger would have had him took away his Horse , and would have had him shot the Prisoner for not giving them the Silver : And that having done robbing Mr. Lenen , they got over the Hedge and went off . The Prisoner deny 'd the Fact , or that he had any Acquaintance with the Prosecutor at that Time ; but being noisy , and too outrageous , so far over shot himself , as strenuously to affirm , that he not Dyer , the Evidence , could not be in that Robbery , because they were at that Time both in Custody , having been taken up on Suspicion of another Robbery : To clear up this Matter , the Court ordered the Books of the Jayl of Newgate to be produced , and search 'd in Court , and it appear 'd , that the Time of their being apprehended together , was near three quarters of a Year distant from the Time of the Commission of this Robbery . He was also indicted a second Time , for robbing John Sibley on the High-Way , and taking from him 9 s. 6 d. in Money , the 21st of September , in the Year 1711 . Edward Herring the Waggoner depos 'd , That between Knights-Bridge and Hyde-Park Corner , two Men called him by his Name , and bid him stop , and John Sibley being in the Waggon , they commanded him to come out , and took from him 9 s. 6 d. but he could not swear to the Persons , it being about two or three a-Clock in a dark Morning : Here he made a Mistake as to the Time the Waggoner depos 'd the Robbery was committed ; in answer to which , he reply 'd . That indeed he had been in a Mistake as to the Time , being so long since ; but had he had his Pocket Book he could have been very punctual , but he had the Misfortune to lose it , for in that he had entred down a particular Account of all the Robberies he had committed : Being ask 'd by the Court what was his Design for keeping a Journal , whether it was upon the Perusal of his Robberies , he might the more particularly repent of them ? he reply 'd , no , but it was for his own Safety , that he might be the more exact when he should have the Opportunity to save himself , by becoming an Evidence . As to the Manner of robbing John Sibley , he depos 'd it was done by himself and the Prisoner , at the Place . and after the Manner the Carrier had depos 'd , and the same Day they went to Southwark Fair , and from thence to Black Heath , and there having committed another Robbery they were pursued , and he shot the Pursuers Horse . The Prisoner also deny 'd this Fact , wishing he might find no Mercy in this World , or the World to come , if he was any Ways concern 'd in either of them ; but being well known to be an ill Person , it did not avail , the Jury found him Guilty of both Indictments .
