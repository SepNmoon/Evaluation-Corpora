They rode through Colbrook , and then two Men followed them at a distance ; and on this side Longford , the same two Men came up to them , with Handkerchiefs in their Months , and their Wigs and Hats pull 'd forward over their Faces . He on the Chesnut Horse held a Pistol to this Evidence , and said , you must go along with me ; and then taking hold of his Horse 's Bridle , led him down the Lane ; the other Man bringing Ludbrook in the same manner . Then making them dismount , he on the Chesnut Horse said to this Evidence , Are you the Lad that swore against Child ? No , says he , I have been Post-boy but a very little while . Was you ever rob 'd yet ? ( said the other ) No , said the Boy ; Why then you must pay Beveridge now , said he , and swore he 'd be reveng 'd upon somebody for poor Child 's sake . Then they turn 'd Ladbrook 's Horse loose , having first cut his Bridle . One of'em then went off with the black Gelding , ( on which this Evidence rode ) and the other bound their Hands behind'em , ty'd'em back to back , and fasten'd'em to a Tree in a Ditch . The Man then ask 'd Ladbrook if he had any Gold in his Pocket , he told him he had but 3 s. 6 d. He then put his Hand in Ladbrook 's Pocket , and finding no more Money , did not take any thing from him , but went away after the other . This Evidence and Ladbrook with strugling got from the Tree , and went tied back to back to an Inn in Longford ; from whence the Ostler came with them , and went down the Lane , where they found the Gelding loose , and the Bags cut open . All the Particulars of this Evidence were confirm 'd by James Ladbrook Ralph Wilson deposed , that he had known Hawkins two Years , but had not been acquainted with Simpson till last August ; they had often consulted together to rob some Mail , and particularly about a Week before the Fact was Committed , they laid their design of Robbing the Bristol Mail . Accordingly about Eleven a Clock on Sunday the 15th of April , they took Horse at the Blew Boar Inn in Southwark ; Hawkins on a tall bay or brown Gelding , Simpson on a Chesnut or Sorrel Mare , and this Evidence on a dapple Grey ; they crost the Water at Kew Ferry , din 'd at the 3 Pigeons at Brentford , staid there till 6 in the Evening , call 'd at the Post-house at Hounslow , loitered on the Road , till they came to the Post-house at Colbrook : where they supt on Horseback , and heard that the Mail would come by between 1 and 2 in the Morning ; from thence they came to Langly broom about midnight , where they agreed to dispatch Simpson alone to meet the Mail , he went , they loiter 'd till his return ; and about 1 a Clock they saw the Post Boy and a Traveller together , and Simpson following them . They then consulted again , and resolv 'd that Simpson and this Evidence should both follow the Mail , and that Hawkins should watch at a distance : because he being pretty bulky , would be the more remarkable . Hawkins and this Evidence then chang 'd Horses , and followed the Boy and Ladbrook through Colbrook ; and on this side Longford , this Evidence and Simpson rode up to them , and taking hold of their Horses Bridles , led them down Harmonsworth Lane , where they dismounted them ; this Evidence left Simpson to bind them , and took the Gelding and Mail to the end of the Lane , where they found Hawkins waiting : they all rifled the Bags , and carried several of them to Hounslow Heath , where they selected the Bath and Bristol Bags , and threw the rest away ; thence they rode through Kingston and Wansworth , and riding down a bye Road , they searched the Bags ; and putting what they thought proper into their Pockets , they threw the Bags and the rest of the Letters over a hedge ; and taking their way through Camberwell , came along Greenwich Road to the Hand Inn in Barnaby-street , between 5 and 6 on Monday Morning . There they put up their Horses , drank a pint of burnt Wine : and sometime after took Coach and drove to the Minories , where they parted , and went by different ways to Francis Green 's , at the Cock and George in the Minories , at which House they went into a Room by themselves ; and the better to take off suspicion , they call 'd for a Candle , Wax , Paper , Pen and Ink : then lockt the door and examined their Prize : and reserving only the Bank bills , they burnt all the other Notes and Letters with the Candle , which they set in the Chimney . They had Three 20 l. Bills , One of 25 l. half a 50 l. Bill , and 2 halves of 25 l. each ; which they equally divided . That the Monday following , this Evidence being Apprehended , made this same Confession , before Mr. Carteret Post Master General : and by his directions the Prisoners were taken , at a House in Green Arbour Court in the Little Old Baily . John Hammond Ostler , at the Blew Boar in Southwark deposed , that Wilson and the 2 prisoners took Horse there , about 11 on Sunday Morning ( April 15th ; ) that Hawkins had a dark brown Gelding , Wilson a Grey one , and Simpson a Chesnut Mare . John Burrows , at the George ( the Post-house ) at Hounslow deposed , that he saw the 2 prisoners and Wilson drinking there at the door on Horse back , between 7 and 8 at Night , and that they went Colbrook Road .

Thomas Parker , at the Hand Inn in Barnaby street deposed , that on Monday Morning the 16th of April between 5 and 6 the 2 prisoners and Wilson came to their Inn , with a Grey Horse , a brown Horse , and a Chesnut Mare ; and they ordered them 2 penny worth of Beans a piece which he gave them . Being askt what reason he had to take notice of the day of the Month , he answer 'd that he was a Weekly Servant , and his Master ow 'd him 7 Weeks wages ( which was 14 s. ) and paid it him altogether that very Day : and therefore he kept an Account of it ; and that he knew Simpson , and suspected him to be a Highwayman , and told several People of it at that time . Richard Room Constable , and Richard Mills , deposed , that when they came to apprehend the prisoners at a House in Green Arbour Court , about 9 at Night , the Daughter came to the Door , and askt what they wanted ; they bid her not be frighted but light a Candle , for they were come to search for stoln Goods . The prisoners who were above Stairs , overhearing them cry 'd out , we are the Men you want , and then Swore , they 'd Shoot the first Man that came up ; Hawkin 's brother Mat , came down foremost , and persuaded the others to surrender quietly . The Evidences told them they came upon Wilsons Information ; why then ( said the prisoner Hawkins ) we are dead Men , but yet had rather lose our Lives , than save them in such a base and infamous manner as that Villain Wilson has done his . Mr. Bell , Comptroller of the Post Office , deposed , that when the Mail was robb 'd , there were 10 Bags wanting , among which were the Bath and Bristol ; but that they were afterwards all brought home , ( except the Bath and Bristol , ) by a Man that found them on Hounslow , Heath . The prisoners in their Defence , objected against Wilson 's Character , as being guilty by his own Confession ; and Hawkins own 'd he had often rode out with Wilson , and particularly on Sunday the 15th of April ; when Simpson , Wilson , and himself , took Horse together , in order to visit his Mother at Staines . When they came to Hounslow they parted , and he came to London that Night , and put up his Horse at William Fuller 's , in Bedford Bury , Covent Garden . William Fuller produc 'd a Note , which was read in Court , viz . April the 10th , 1722 . Receiv 'd of John Hawkins , the Sum of 1 l. 10 s. in full of all Accounts , by me William Fuller . He then depos 'd that Hawkins paid him the Money on the Day mentioned in the Receipt . That Hawkins wrote the Body of the Note in his sight ; and that he ( Fuller ) sign 'd it at the same time , and with the same Ink . That on the next Sunday Night after this Note was given , Hawkins came to his House , put up his Horse , lay there that Night , and did not go out till next Morning . That he had likewise taken an Account of the same Money in his Book , which he had unluckily forgot to bring with him ; and reading an Advertisement in the Gazette , concerning the Mail 's being robb 'd , he compar 'd his Book and the Note together , and they exactly agreed . But the Note being examin 'd in Court , it was apparent that it was not sign 'd with the same Ink as the Body of it was wrote withal . Francis Green , at the Cock and George in the Minories , depos 'd , that the prisoners , and Wilson , had been several times at his House , but he did not remember that ever they lock 'd themselves in a private Room , and call 'd for Pen , Ink , Paper , Wax , Ec . Edward Carter depos 'd , that Wilson came to his House to enquire for Hawkins and Simpson ; he acquainting Hawkins with it , Hawkins said , If he comes again , pray deny me to him ; for I find he 's a Fellow of an ill Character , and I do n't desire to have any further Conversation with him . This Evidence soon after going to see Wilson in the Compter , Wilson said to him , I am sorry I have wronged Simpson , but I 'll hang that Rogue Hawkins if it is possible , because his Brother has impeach 'd me . Henry Hunt depos 'd , that he was a Stock Jobber , had known Hawkins seven or eight Years , and believed him to be a very honest Man , because he had dealt with him in South Sea , and other Bubbles . That in particular , he had sold Hawkins two River Douglasses for 20 l. and had lent him 10 , 20 and 30 Guineas at a time , all which Hawkins repaid him very honourably . Hawkins then call 'd several Witnesses to his manner of Living , who depos 'd , that he was born at Staines , and a few Years ago was a Livery Servant to Sir Dennis Dutry ; after which he traded to France and Holland , in Wine , Brandy , Etc . Simpson likewise call 'd several Witnesses to his manner of Living , who depos 'd , that he was born at Putney and from thence , when a Child , remov 'd with his Parents to Spalding , in Lincolnshire . That he was some time a Bailiff , and kept an Inn in Lincoln ; but failing there , about two Years and a half ago he hir 'd himself Under Butler to the Lord Castlemain , where he liv 'd a Year and a half , and bore a good Character . Mr Green depos 'd , that Simpson had serv 'd him honestly , as Footman , for four or five Months ; but believ 'd he had not been in any Service since he left his , which was nine Months ago , because no body had since applied to him for a Character . Then he call 'd some Witnesses to prove that his Sister 's Husband , Richard Eiiet , dying at Bawtry in Yorkshire , and leaving four Children behind him , he went thither to assist her in getting in her Debts . After which he went to another Sister , at Sutton , from whence he came to London about eight Weeks ago .
