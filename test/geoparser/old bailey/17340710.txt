Near 11 at Night , going by the Lock and Key , in Smithfield , the Prisoner catc 'd hold of me , and ask 'd me to give her a D am I went with her to a Brandy-shop in Duck Lane ; I stay 'd there half an Hour , and we had three Quarterns of Brandy . I was a little Suspicious , and therefore felt several times for my Watch , and still found it in my Pocket . But by and by , she suddenly call 'd the Woman of the House , and gave her the Money for the Brandy , at which I was a little Surpriz 'd , and feeling again for my Watch , I miss 'd it . I held fast hold of the Prisoner , and call 'd for a Constable , upon which two Men , who were in the Foreroom , for she and I were in a private Room backwards , came and hussled me about , and one of them pretended to be a Constable , and order 'd me to quit her , but however I would not let her go , but carry 'd her to the Watch-house in Cloth-Fair , and the Constable committed us both to the Compter - Next Day she offer 'd to return the Watch for 2 Guineas , and afterwards the Man at the Brandy-shop promis 'd to help me to it for a Guinea and a Half .

Acquitted . 19 , 20 Mary Haycock , ( Wife of John Haycock , and Ann Haycock her Daughter , were indicted for High Teason , for having in their Custody a Pair of wooden Flasks for Coining , without any lawful Cause . They were a second Time indicted for concealing the said Flasks : And a third time for Coining 3 false and counterfeit Six pences , June 1 . The first and second Indictments appearing defective , the Prisoners were then try 'd on the third . Ann Russel . The Prisoners were discharged out of Newgate the Sessions before last , and the very Night of their being set at Liberty , they came to Lodge in my Room , in Drury-Lane , almost facing Backer's-Lane . I saw them do nothing there , but in 2 or 3 Weeks my Landlord was put to a Nonplush , and so we were all forced to move - Then I took a Room up two Pair of Stairs in Mrs. Weaver 's House in Baldwin's-Gardens , and the Prisoners went with me . I had 2 Beds , the old Woman Mary Haycock lay with me ( for my Husband who is a Shoemaker , worked at Battersea ) and her Daughter Ann Haycock and another lay together in the other Bed - There was a little Closet in the Room with a Door to it , but no Lock nor Key , where we used to put odd Things out of the way . It was darkish , tho ' not so dark neither , but one could see common Things . The old Woman used often to take a Candle and go into this Closet , and shut the Door , and stay there a pretty while . The Daughter seldom went in but when she was call 'd . Council . Do you know what the old Woman did there ? Russel . I thought she was at Work . Council . What Work ? Russel Coining . Council . What reason had you to think so ? Russel . She had been try 'd at Hicks's-Hall for putting off bad Money , but was discharged , and I was in hopes she was innocent when I took her in to Lodge with me . But one Night , when I was in Bed , I heard her blowing the Fire , upon which I got up anend , an asked her what she was about ; she said , No harm - There was an Instrument full of Whiting , which was a Mould , that lay upon the Hearth ; she put some Metal into two Tobacco-pipes , and put them into the Fire , and when the Metal was melted , she took the Mold in one Hand and the Pipe in another , and Teem 'd [ pour 'd ] the Metal into the Mold , and afterwards open 'd it , and took out a Six-pence , and put it into her Pocket Apron , and so she did several times , but her Daughter was not with her all that Time . Mrs. Haycock ( says I ) I thought you were not guilty of such Things , but since I find how it is , in my Room you shall stay no longer : she said I need not be so uneasy , for no harm should come to me . This was on a Tuesday Night . M. Haycock . And why did not you inform sooner ? Russel . Because I did not know who to apply to , but upon enquiring I found out Mr. North who belongs to the Mint . Council . Did you see the Girl Ann Haycock do any thing ? Russel . I came up Stairs one Day , and knock 'd at the Door , the Mother asked who was there ? I said it was I , she did not open the Door directly , but when I got in , I saw two Pipes in the Fire , and the Mold upon the Hearth . She took the Pipes out and laid them aside , and put the Mold into her Apron , and her Daughter was then with her . I did not then see the Daughter do any thing . But once I saw the Daughter boiling something in a little Tin-pot , I look 'd into the Pot , and there was 14 or 15 Shillings and Six-pences . I ask 'd her what she was doing , but she took the Pot away and said it did not concern me - There was a sort of Red stuff in the Pot - Another time I saw the Girl with several Six-pences in her Lap , and she was rubbing them with Whiting . Mr. North . On the 27th of May , Ann Russel gave me much the same Account as she has given now - I appointed to meet her on Saturday , June 1 , and accordingly , taking two ( Mr. Morris and Mr. Atkins ) to assist me , we met . The Street Door was open : We went up softly , and Atkins being foremost he push 'd against the Door of the Room , and it gave way , and we went in . The old Woman made a great Outcry of Murder , and was so turbulent , that we were oblig 'd to tye her Hands , tho ' we had some difficulty in doing it . There was a Candle in the Closet - Atkins said that he saw something glitter in a little notch in the Floor , just by the Wall , and there he found two counterfeit Six-pences , which he gave to me : Morris found three more , and these are the five - I take them to be nothing but Pewter . There were several Rags and Pieces of Leather that seem 'd to be whited with Whiting . There was a Deal-box too : I ask 'd the Girl for the Key of it , she said it belong 'd to a young Woman who was gone out , and had taken the Key with her ; upon which I was going to break it open , but upon second thoughts I resolv 'd to search the old Woman first . I did so , and in her Pocket found this Key . It fitted the Lock , and I open 'd the Box with it . There was a pretty deal of Cambrick in the Box , and several odd Things of little value , which I suppose they had bought in putting off their bad Money . At last I met with this Pair of wooden Flasks for Coining : The way is , to fill these with fine powder 'd Chalk , and then make an impression of the Money they design to Counterfeit ; there was likewise this little Box of Red Argol : 'T is what the Silver-smiths Use , by boiling it with the Silver they have cast , to fetch the sand out of the Pores of the Silver , and cleanse it from dirt and soil . It appears to be the same that the last Evidence observed in the Tin-pot when the Girl was boiling the Counterfeit Money , for here is that Pot ( which we found in the Closet ) and some of the Argol is still sticking about the sides . M. Haycock . Was I in the Closet , or the Room when you came in ? Mr. North . I am not certain which , but I think you were near the Closet , if not in it . M. Haycock . I was just stept into the Closet with a Candle in my Hand to fetch a Dish to take up my Husband 's Dinner . Mr. North . When I first open 'd the Box the Daughter desir 'd me not to take the Linnen away , because it was all they shou 'd have to live upon in Newgate . When I came to the Flasks , I said to her , You pretend to a great deal of Innocence ; but how came you by these ? She pleaded Ignorance ; but while I was searching farther , she turn 'd aside to her Mother , and said softly , Mother we are gone ! I carried them before my Lord Mayor , and then I return 'd to the Room , to see what else I cou 'd meet with . I poked among the Ashes , where I found some dross , and little pieces of Metal , and several Tobacco-pipes , that look 'd as if they had been burnt in the Fire . M. Haycock . Any body might happen to have a burnt Pipe in their Room . Mr. North . But these Pipes had Metal in them , and it was run a good way up the holes - Here is one that is broke , but the pieces hang together by the Lead . M. Haycock . Did you find any bad Money upon me when you searched me ? Mr. North . No - I found some Money , but it was good . Henry Atkins . I assisted Mr. North . I went up first , and found the Door ty 'd with a piece of red Tape . I push 'd it open , and went directly into the Closet , where the Mother was kneeling or sitting with a Candle in her hand ; she set up a terrible Irish Hallaloo . I pull 'd her out into the Room , but she was so very troublesome that we were forced to tye her Hands . I saw something glitter in a Crevice in the Closet Floor , just by the Wall ; upon examining , I found two counterfeit Six-pences , which I gave to Mr. North . I heard him ask the Girl for the Key , and heard her say , that another young Woman had got it ; and saw him take it from the old Woman , and open the Box , and found the Flasks ; but I did not hear what the Girl said to the old Woman - And I was with Mr. North when he found the Pipes with the Metal in them . Henry Morris , Clerk to Mr. North . Mr. Atkins went in first , and got the old Woman out of the Room ; she made a great Noise and resisted ; and thereupon we ty 'd her Hands . Mr. North asked for the Key ; it was deny 'd , but he found it on the old Woman , and open 'd the Box , and as soon as he found the Flasks , she fell into a greater Agony than before , and shriek 'd out , Murder and Thieves ! Atkins found 2 Six-pences , and I found 3 more . M. Haycock . It was not my Box , but Mrs Russel 's where the Things were found . Russel . That 's true , but I lent her the Box to put her Things in , and I made no use of it while she was there . M. Haycock . I had no occasion for a Box , for I had not a ha'porth of any thing to put into one , having been 5 Weeks in Prison , where I and my Daughter got the Jail Distemper - And I have 6 Children - It 's very strange that after I had suffer 'd so much on Suspicion of putting off bad Money , I shou 'd venture to Coin in an open Room , that had no Lock to the Door : And besides , there was another Woman , Katherine Kelly , constantly in the same Room , and therefore they only swear this against me , for the sake of a Reward . Here , Mrs. Kelly - Pray Mrs. Kelly did you ever see me Coin ? or handle any bad Money ? or see any body come after me with bad Money ? or see me sit up later than ordinary ? Katherine Kelly . No . M. Haycock . And I defy all the World to say otherwise . Council . But some part of the World have sworn otherwise . Council . What Country Woman are you ? Kelly . An Irish Woman - I lay in the same Room with the Prisoners . Russel . Yes , she was in the same Room but she was a Bed and asleep when the Prisoner made the Six-pences . Kelly . I might be asleep , I do n't deny that . The Jury acquitted the Daughter , and found the Mother Guilty . Death . 21 , 22. Elizabeth Tracey , and Ann Knight , were indicted , with Judith Murray not yet taken , for high Treason : in making 30 false and counterfeit Six-pences , Feb. 20. in the 6th Year of the King . They were a second time indicted for making 20 false and counterfeit Shillings . Ann St. Laurence . My Brother-in-law , * John Brown ( who married my Sister Margaret ) brought me acquainted with this Knight , and that Tracey in November , 1733 . I saw them first at my Brother 's Room , in Mercer-Street behind Long-Acre , but the Prisoner liv 'd in White-Lion-Street , near the 7 Dials - My Brother is now Dead . * John Brown , and Margaret his Wife , alias Margaret Berry , were condemn 'd for Coining in October 1733 . Session Paper . Numb . 8. p. 222 . Council . How did he die ? St. Laurence . He suffer 'd . Council . Was he hang 'd ? St. Laurence . Yes , for Coining - God rest his Soul - and my Sister was condemn 'd too , but proving with Child she was afterwards Transported - Poor Woman ! When she first married him she did not know what Trade he follow 'd - But he came home one day Alefied , and struck her , and said she must part with Hereticks , or be damn 'd - For ye must know he was a Papish . Council . Do you know any thing of their Coining ? St. Laurence . Yes , about the 30th of Jan. was 12 month , I went to see my Brother the Prisoner , and Judith Murray was with him . They appear 'd a little surpriz 'd : But he told them , they need not be afraid , for I was his Wife 's Sister - I saw them produce Six-pences out of an Iron Mould , for they said , they had made use of wooden Moulds , but did not like them , because they warped . Tracey had a Pipe in her Mouth when I came in , and held her Apron up so . Judith Murray was cleaning a Pipkin , and Knight stood with her back against the Dresser . But as soon as my Brother had put them out of their fears , Tracey put the Pipe into the fire , and melted some Metal . Then she held her Knees so - And the Iron frame so - And took out the Pipe , and pour 'd the Metal into the Frame , and when it was cold she threw out Shillings . I did not see Knight do any thing then ; but afterwards I saw her clip the nobs off the Sixpences , and cut them smooth on the Edges , and then file them , and rub them smooth in a Flannel . At the End of August , or beginning of September , I went to Mr. Strong , [ or Stahan 's Cellar ] at the Fox in King-Street by the Seven Dials , and there was Tracey and Catherine Bougle , and Mary Haycock , and her Daughter Nanny . Mother Haycock was making half Crowns to go into the Country , for she said they cou 'd put them off better in the Country than in Town , for the Country People were not so cautious ; but Six-pences were left for London . Damn me , says Tracey , if I would ever go into the Country with half Crowns , as long as I get a Crown a Night in London with Six pences . The Prisoners both engaged me to put off Money for them . I have put off ten or twelve Shillings a Night , and had half for my Pains - We used to buy Smallcoal , Tape , Thread , or any odd triflle to get Change . Tracey . She had no Occasion to put off bad Money for me when she could have enough from her Brother - She might have taken me up when my Sister was in Prison , or when I my self was 5 Weeks in Jail - She swore falsely against Maccanelly , told me if I would give her 8 Guineas , she would not Prosecute my Sister - And why does she swear against me now ? St. Laurence . For the good of his Majesty , and the Poor Publick , that they might not be imposed on . Alice Dearing . About 3 Months before Christmas was a 12 Month , the Prisoner came to my Room , and enquired when I had seen Elizabeth Wright ( who was the Prisoner Knight 's Mother ) for they knew that I was acquainted with her . Tracey brought me 20 counterfeit Six-pences , which is 10 Shillings in the Plural Number , and said if you can make off these to Night , I 'll bring you as many more to Morrow Morning , and so in the Morning she brought me ten more , by the same token that I had got a Quartern-loaf upon the Table . And at Night Tracey and Judith Murray were sent to Clarkenwell , for putting off bad Money ; and Knight came to me with a little heavy Trunk , and asked me if I had got a spare Room ? I told her Yes ; and then she desired me to lend her a Candle , a Fire shovel , and some Small-coal ; so she went into the Room , and lit a fire . I peep 'd in , and finding what she was about , I push 'd back the Lock , and she had got a Pipe in her Hand , and a Mould in her Lap , What are you at this Work ? Says I. Aye , says she , I must do it here for fear the Metal should be found at my Lodging , tho ' I have left 12 half Crowns under my washing Tub . I saw her make 12 or 14 Six-pences ; it 's true upon the virtue of my Oath ; and then she said she must go to Strong 's Cellar to finish them . I went thither after her , and there she was boiling Money ; what I swear , is upon the Truth , and God 's Truth ; and she said , Give me the ten Shillings you had of Tracey , for the Colour is not good enough , and I must mend it , and so I gave her ten Shillings in the Plural Number . Another time when I was at Strong 's , Tracey came in and said , If you go into the Country to pass away Money , put Wheat , Meal , and Cheshire Cheese crumbled among it , and that will make it 's Colour ; and then she pull 'd out a Purse with some Money in it , and said , how bright these look ? Her Sister Catharine Bougle was there at the same time . One time I went to Tracey 's , at the French Change , and knock 'd at the Door , whose there ? says she ; 't is Alice Dearing , says I . Then she open 'd the Door , and said , O , I am not afraid of you . And there I saw her turn out 10 or 12 Shillings . Knight . It was you that swore away my Mother 's Life and my Sister 's . Dearing . I have seen Tracey in St. Laurence 's Sister 's Room , in Mercer-street , in Long-Acre , and I know Tracey had a Lodging in White-Lion-street - She led John Brown into the secret of stealing the Silver Cup , for which they were both try 'd . Tracey . Why did not you inform against me when you swore against Wright ? Dearing . Tracey came to my Room , and said , What are you going along with Nan St. Laurence , to swear against my Sister - And then taking up a Knife - Shall I speak the Words ? - G - Blood a Nouns , says she , if any Whore or Bitch should swear against my Sister , I will slinge her as I did the Bitch that stopt me for Shop lifting - I gave her 8 or 9 Stabs , tho ' I did not kill her - Or else G - d - 'em I 'll Pop 'em , or do their Business some other way . And so she laid the Knife down then , and I took it up , and said she should never kill any Body with that Knife . Tracey . But you swore away my Mother 's Life for all that . Anthony Macknelly . I know nothing of their Coining , but I have seen them often put off bad Six-pences , and particularly about February was a 12 Month . Knight - It was you that hang 'd Brow-and his Wife - Why did not you inform against us ? Macnelly . So I did : I acquainted Mr. North with it when I inform 'd against Brown and his Wife , and his Wife 's Sister St. Laurence - But I have been in Confinement 14 Months . Council . Call Winifred Swinney . Tracey . She do n't know one of us from t'other . [ Then the Prisoners changed Places . ] Winifred Swinney . I have seen the Prisoners Coin several times , by means of an unfortunate Nephew of mine , I have been with them in putting off bad Money - It 's true on the virtue of my Oath . Council . Which is Tracey ? Swinney . She in the Green-gown , and the other in the Linnen Gown is Knight ; I have been with them at their Lodgings at Mr. Frazier 's a Potter's-shop in White-Lion-Street up 2 Pair of Stairs , on the right hand from the 7 Dials , at Brown 's Lodgings in Vine street , in Broad St. Giles 's , and in - Cammel 's Room , three Days after Brown was taken - Cammel is a little Fellow in a Green-coat , he cries News ; I know that Ann St. Laurence is Brown 's Sister - Tracey stole a Silver Cup , and put it into Brown 's Pocket , and they were both try 'd for it here . The Prisoners Defence . Tracey . Hearing that Alice Dearing was concern 'd in Coining , I inform 'd against her , and Coining-Implements were found in her House . However Mr. North sent me to Jail for a conspiracy against her Life , under pretence that I had put the Implements into her House on purpose , and he excepted against my Bail , till he met with St. Laurence and Swtney . Knight . The Implements were not only found in Dearing 's House , but she had let me so far into the secret , that I could have proved her guilty of Coining - But she said that Mr. North had given her leave to Coin . James Smart , Turnkey of New-Prison . About the 15th of June last , Alice Dearing came to the Prisoner , and drank with them , and said if they 'd give her 5 Guineas she 'd not prosecute them . Shorey . Strong rented a Cellar of me - I afterwards heard that People made Money there ; and so I went and search 'd , but I found no signs of Fire . Elizabeth Strong . The Prisoners were never in my Cellar to my knowledge . Elizabeth Cammel . I never saw the Prisoers come in my Room - I know St. Laurence to be both Whore and Thief . Mary Lacy . and so do I too - she 's a vild Woman . Elizabeth Reynolds . Aye , so she is - She stole a Loin of Pork in St. James's-Market - And she said to me , Ah you fool , if you would but swear against Tracey and Knight you should have half the Reward , and then you need not carry them heavy Loads . My Husband stood behind and knock 'd me down for keeping such Company . Edward Reynolds . So I did - for Dearing said , that she ow 'd them a great spight , and would make my Wife a Gentlewoman if she 'd swear against them . Mary Minnocks . I was Alice Dearing 's Maid , she often tutor 'd me to take these Peoples Lives away . She said she had got 19 l. by convicting Wright , and I should have 20 l. if I swore against these , and if I did not she would swear against me ; and so I was persuaded to swear against them , but my Conscience flew into my Face after I had done it . Knight . I was in Ireland when the things they charge me with were done . Eleanor Hall . On the 14th of December last , Knight and I left Dublin and came to England together . Council . But are you sure she had not been in England before that time ? Hall . I know nothing of that . The Jury found the Prisoners both Guilty . Death . 23. Aaron Jarvis , was indicted for privately stealing a Handkerchief , value 1 s. 6 d. from the Person of William Early , June 5 . Mr . Early . As I was going thro ' Bishopsgate , between 8 and 9 in the Evening , the Prisoner put his Hand into my Pocket , and drew my Handkerchief half way out - I seiz 'd his hand with the Handkerchief in it , and held him till he was secur 'd . The Jury found him Guilty . 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 24. Elizabeth Bradley , was indicted for stealing 2 Brass Kettles , and other Things , the Goods of Sarah De Paz , July 1 . Acquitted . 25 , 26. Mary Taylor , and Frances Hedges , were indicted for stealing a Hat , a Wig , a Prayer Book , the Goods of James Cannon , July 8 . Guilty 10 d. each . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 27. Catharine Bougle , alias Tracey , was indicted for Hig Treason , in Coining 40 false and counterfeit Six-pences , August 8 . She was a second time indicted for Coining 12 counterfeit Shillings , August 30 . Ann St. Laurence . The Prisoner 's Name is Tracey , but she goes by the Names Steward and Bougle . Prisoner . Tracey was my Maiden Name , but my Husband 's Name is Bougle . St. Laurence . She Lodg 'd at Alice Dearing 's , against the George in little Drury-lane , by the new Church in the Strand - In the beginning of August I met by chance my Brother-in-law John Brown , and ask 'd him where his Wife ( my Sister ) was ; for since she was got in among these Coiners , I knew not where to find her . My Brother told me , I might meet with her at Alice Dearing 's . So about 11 next Morning , I went to Dearing 's , where I found only the Prisoner and my Brother , he told her that I was his Wife 's Sister , and told me , that the Prisoner was Bett Tracey 's Sister . Then he went to Work , and made some Money , which he threw into her Lap , and she cut off the knobs , and filed the Edges . In about an Hour 's time Alice Dearing came in , and after her my Sister . I staid till 3 a Clock in the afternoon . This was about the 9th or 10th of August , and about 4 days after I went to Christopher Strong 's Cellar ; his Wife was with Child , and my Sister Margaret Brown introduced me to be the Nurse : there were my Brother and Sister , Mother Haycock , and her Daughter and Sons , the Prisoner and her Sister Betty Stracy . They had got 2 Iron Molds , one for Shillings and another for Six-pences , with something white in the middle . They melted Pint and half Pint Pewter Pots in a Fire-shovel over a Charcoal-fire , and then cut the Metal into small Pieces , which they put into a Pipe , and so melted the same again , and then pour 'd it into the Molds , and threw Shillings out of one Mold , and Six-pences out of another . Council . Who did this ? St. Laurence . My Brother made Six-pences , and gave them to the Prisoner , who cut off the Lumps , and pared the Money round , and filed the Edges in Imitation of Milling , and rubbed them with Flannel . She put one into my Hand , and said , It is a pity that any Body should be hang 'd for their Ingenuity . When he was hot and tired , she took some of the Lumps she had cut off , and squeezing them together with her Teeth , put them into a Pipe , melted them , and pour 'd the Metal into the Shilling Mold , and so made Shillings . Mother Haycook and her Daughter , and John Knight her Son , and Betty Tracey , were employ 'd in making half Crowns , to carry into the Country - Tracey said , that Six-pences went off best at Publick-houses in Town ; and that Tankards were the best Pewter for making Money - Mrs. Strong brought in some Charcoal - I stay 'd there about an Hour - The Prisoner and I , and my Brother and Sister afterwards put off the Six-pences in Spittle-Fields ; but the Prisoner put off the first in Cheapside , to an old Woman that sold Nuts and Gingerbread . I said it was a Shame to cheat such a poor Woman , and so I went back and gave her a good Six-pence for the bad one . Tracey went presently into the Country to make off the half Crowns , for the Country People were not so sharp as those in London ; and I saw no more of her till October , the Night before my Brother and Sister were try 'd . Prisoner . Put her to the Virtue of her Oath , why she did not discover me sooner . St. Laurence . Because my Brother was concern 'd with her . But after he was try 'd , I heard that she was taken at Hammersmith , and committed to the Gatehouse ; and then I inform 'd Mr. North where she was . Prisoner . When my Sister was upon her Trial , did not you give Two-pence to get me into Court ? St. Laurence . Yes . Prisoner . And why did you not take me then ? St. Laurence . Because your Sister hurry 'd you away , and you got out of Court as soon as the Trial was over ; and I saw you no more , 'till Alice Dearing told me you were in the Gatehouse for putting off bad Money at Hammersmith . Prisoner . I was taken the 4th of December , and kept 'till the 27th of April , which was near 5 Months , and you did not give your Information 'till the 4th of March . St. Laurence . I inform 'd 6 Months ago , upon the Virtue of my Oath - You were sent from the Gatehouse to Hicks's-Hall , where you were try 'd and acquitted . Prisoner . That was for putting off bad Money ; but why was I not try 'd for Coining ? Alice Dearing . I was acquainted with Elizabeth Wright , who was convicted of Coining when she first came from Ireland , which was about two Years ago ; but I did not then know what Business she follow 'd . She went back again , and came over a second Time , in August last , with the Prisoner . Before I had seen Wright , the Prisoner came to my Room , and told me Wright was come again , but that they had quarrel 'd - How so ? says I . Why , says the Prisoner , I made off 6 l. and she allow 'd me but half a Guinea , tho ' I ought to have had the best Part , for the Moulds were mine , and I made most of the Money . Prisoner . Put her to the Virtue of her Oath upon that . Dearing . I am upon my Oath . And she said , she had but that half Guinea in the World , and therefore desir 'd I would let her lie with my Children , 'till she could get another Lodging . I consented , and on the third Day she desir 'd I would give her leave to work . What work ? says I . You shall see , says she ; and so she took the Moulds out of her Pocket , melted some Pewter in a Fire-Shovel , and then threw it on the Hearth , and cut it into small Pieces . Then she sent my Boy for a Pipe , put some Metal into it , and when it was hot , she held the Mould on her Knee thus - and pour 'd the Metal in , and knock 'd it thus - to settle . When it was cold she threw out a King William 's Six-pence , plainer on the Cross side than the Head . After she had done , she knock 'd the white Stuff out of the Moulds , ty 'd them in one Cloth , and the Stuff in another - I was curious to see the Moulds , before she broke them ; but she would not let me , for she said , she had sworn to let no Body see them , but those that had seen them before - She clipp 'd the Edges of the Six-pences with her Scissars , and then scraped them with a Knife , and went to a Brasier 's , the Corner of Catherine-Street , and bought a warded File , with which she filed them , and then rubb 'd them , and boil 'd them in the Soap and a yellow Stuff that Dyers use . Prisoner . St. Laurence said it was Cochineal . Dearing . You had several Colours - I went out with her that Night to a Brandy-shop , where she put off one , and then she went to look for Mrs. Strong , to go out with her . About two Weeks after this ( having left her to look after my Children while I went out to work ) I went home , and found the Prisoner and John Brown , and St. Laurence with her ; the Prisoner open 'd the Door with something in her Lap . I said , What have you been doing ? She answer 'd , You know - St. Laurence shook her Head at me ; and Brown being no great Acquaintance , went out . Then the Prisoner open 'd her Apron , and shew 'd me near 100 King William 's Six-pences , and said , that she and Brown made them . I told her she should do no more there , for if my Husband should know of it he 'd sacrifice me . She promis 'd she would not ; but she would find out Moll Haycock , who was her Scholar . But yet about Bartholomew-Tide , I caught her at it again with John Brown . I thought I had warn 'd you of this before , says I . Well , says she , the Metal is just melted , and when I have made this out , I 'll make no more in your Room ; and then she made 20 Six-pences and some Shillings . The last pour 'd was a half Six-pence , for there was not Metal enough for a whole one - As she was going down Stairs , she met her Sister Betty Tracey , who told her she had found out Moll . Haycock . After this the Prisoner bought some Necklaces , and other Pedlars Wares , and went into the Country , thro ' Oxford to Bybury , 70 Miles from London , and I went with her . She had some Money of her own making , some of her Sister 's , and some of Brown 's , and we put off 6l . in that Journey . Prisoner . Mr. North and she are both in one Injunction - What Conversation had you with Wright at her second coming over ? Dearing . She desir 'd me to go out with her , and gave me a Six pence to put off in Lombard-Street , and I was taken up for it , and try 'd at Guild-Hall , and acquitted . Court . Why did you let the Prisoner continue so long in your House , if you were so fearful your Husband should know it ? Dearing . The Truth is , I was willing to learn to Coin myself , but could not , for they would never let me into the Secret . Prisoner . I was in Jail when Elizabeth Wright was try 'd , and why did you not inform against me then ? Dearing . I did not think it was you , because you were committed by the Name of Bougle , and I never knew you by any other Name than Tracey and Stuart . Prisoner . I was committed by the Name of Tracey - But you had need talk of Names , when you go by three Names your self - Dearing , Crouder , and Bunting . Winifred Swinney . I secur 'd the Prisoner . My Acquaintance begun by means of a Nephew , who was acquainted with Brown , who left him in the Lurch in the Gate-house - In last August , I went to Strong 's Cellar , to get some Subsistence for my Nephew , and there was Brown and the Prisoner . She took some melted Metal out of an Iron ladle with a Pipe , and pour 'd it into a little round Thing like Iron , and she open 'd it , and Six-pences or Shillings came out . They would not let me have the iron Thing in my Hand , for fear of letting me into the Secret - I saw her Coin but three times , one Day she made Shillings , and two Days Six-pences . After they were cast , she clipp 'd and filed them , and put 'em into her Handkerchief , and bent them in her Mouth Then she got a Ha'porth of Hemlock and a Quarter of a Pound of Soap , and put them into a Pot with Water and the Money ; and Strong 's Wife blow 'd the Charcoal fire to make it boil - I thought it had been spoil 'd , and they were going to melt it over-again - After this I met the Prisoner in Holborn . We went into a Gin-shop , and she gave a Six-pence to change I had her Apron to wash , there were several Holes in it , and I ask 'd her how they came ? She said she had burnt them with the Metal . Mr. North . Some time about December last , the Prisoner , and Mary and Ann Haycock were sent to the Gatehouse for putting off bad Money at Hammersmith . They were try 'd at Hicks's-Hall , and acquitted . But on the 14th of February , which was before the Trial , St. Laurence inform 'd me that she had seen them and others Coin in Dearing 's Lodgings . Prisoner . And why did not you indict us then for Coining ? Mr. North . Because I was willing to keep the Information secret as long as I could , there being others in it who were not then taken . But when the Prisoner and the Haycocks were acquitted , I was oblig 'd to discover my Information in order to detain them . Prisoner . Then why did not you find a Bill in April Sessions ? Mr. North . St. Laurence was then gone out of the Way , and I knew not where to find her , and so they were discharged ; but were taken again . Prisoner . Jack North had her in his Company - Do n't deny it , Jack . Mr. North . I met with St. Laurence afterwards , and she said she had been to see her Sister Margaret Berry to Gravesend The Jury found her Guilty . Death . 28. George King , was indicted for stealing ( with Richard Dyer , not yet taken ) some old Iron , old Rope , 3 Dozen of Stockfish , and 12 Pieces of Beer , the Goods of Martin Salter , in the Ship Don Francisco , June 14 . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 29. Humphry Remmington , of Finchly , was indicted for the Murder of William Wells , by giving him , on the Right side of the Head with a Dung-fork , one mortal Wound and Bruise , June 8 , of which he dy 'd the same Day . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . The Witnesses were examin 'd a-part . Richard Roberts . The Deceas 'd , and William Kirby , and I , were going to water our Horses at a Pond before the Prisoner 's door , on Finchly-Common . The Prisoner came out , hit my Fore-horse on the Head , and took me a good Knock ; but for all that , I went to lead my Horse to the Pond , upon which the Prisoner took me by the Hair , and dragg 'd me to his Door , and beat and abused me . Kirby said , do n't abuse the Lad ; but if he has done any thing contrary to Law , take the Law of him . And the Deceas 'd ( who was then unreining his Horses ) said , If you want to fight , do n't fight with a Lad , but with a Man ; and so begun to unbutton his Coat . Upon that the Prisoner went in , and fetch 'd out a three tined Dung-fork . Sure , says Kirby , you wo n't be such a Villain as to knock the Man down ? The Deceas 'd made no offer to fight ; but the Prisoner struck him on the Head with the edge of the Dung-fork , and he dropt down immediately - We help him up , and set him against the Sign-post , and in less than a Quarter of an Hour got him upon his Horse ; the Prisoner in the mean time was damning and swearing that no Body should come to Water at his Pond . The Deceas 'd rode about a Mile , but dopt his Head like a drunken Man ; but then he could ride no farther , Lord have mercy upon me , says he , he has almost kill 'd me . So we put him into his Master 's Dung-cart , and he lean 'd his Head over the Side of it , and vomited a little Blood , and so he was carry 'd to Hadley Windmill , where his Mother-in-Law lives . We felt on the Right-side of his Head , and felt it was broke : He was put to Bed , and , as I heard , dy 'd in two Hours - Here is the Fork - the Prisoner held this , and struck the Deceas 'd on the Head with this side of the Iron Tines - I live at Hadley . We were coming from London , and went to Water our Horses at this Pond , which lies in the Highway , and is a common Watering-place . Prisoner . Is not the Pond rail 'd in ? Roberts . It is rail 'd ; but not quite round , there is a Cartway left for People to drive Carts and Waggons in . Prisoner . I did not deny your going in with your Horses ; but I told you , that you should not draw your Cart in . Roberts . No , you did not speak one Word , but struck my Fore-horse ; and when I took the Fore-horse to lead him in , you fell upon me - The Deceas 'd had unreined his Horses , in order to Water them , but had not water 'd them when you knock 'd him down ; for he came after you to speak to you for beating me . Prisoner . How far is the Pond from my House ? Roberts . 4 or 5 Pole . Prisoner . Did not 3 Men strip and follow me 30 Yards quite to my own Door ? Roberts . No , there was not a Soul stript . The Deceas 'd had only begun to strip . William Kirby . The Prisoner beat the Lad , and I said , do n't beat the Boy , but if he had done any thing against Law , take another Course with him . The Deceas 'd was then standing by the Highway 2 or 3 Pole from the House , and said to the Prisoner , do n't beat the Boy , beat a Man . Upon which the Prisoner ran in and brought out a Dung-fork . His Wife follow 'd him and said , What ! have you a mind to be hang 'd ? And says I , sure you do n't design to be such a Villain as to kill the Man ? The Deceas 'd never lifted up his Hand against the Prisoner , but was standing thus with his Coat unbutton 'd , and just turn 'd back over his Shoulder , when the Prisoner struck him on the Head with the Prong of the Fork edgeways , and down he fell . The Boy and I help 'd him up . He loll 'd his Head against the Horse block , but in a little time he something recover 'd himself , and then we put him upon his Horse , and afterwards into the Dung-cart , where he spit Blood ; and so was carried to his Father-in-law : He had a Bruise on the right side of his Head . We sent for a Surgeon , and then left him . Prisoner . Was not you stript to fight me ? Kirby . No , Nobody was stript . Prisoner . Did not you follow me to my own Door ? And why ? Kirby . No , no farther than your Sign Post that stands out in the Road , and there the Deceas 'd was knock 'd down - 'T is the sign of the Windmill , a quarter of a Mile from Whetstone . Council . How came you on the Prisoner 's Ground ? Kirby . His Ground ? I thought it had been the King 's Ground - The Pond has been a common watering Place ever since the oldest Man in the Parish can remember . Joseph Hughs . I came up with my Teem 2 Minutes before the blow was struck . The Deceas 'd was then going to strip , and the Prisoner came out with the Fork and knock 'd him down , while his Clothes were half stript over his Shoulders . He was help 'd upon his Nag , and told the Prisoner he would make an example of him for striking him with such a Weapon . Then the Deceas 'd took his Teem and rode , sometimes sitting and sometimes lying upon his Nag for about half a Mile , and then they put him upon his Load of Dung , and carried him to his Father-in-law , Thomas Perry , at Hadley . Prisoner . Were not you stript ? Hughs . No , nor Nobody else . Prisoner . Did not the Deceas 'd threaten to fight me ? Hughs . No , he only said , do n't set your wit to a Boy but to a Man - The Deceas 'd was about 35 Years old . Wright Faulkner , Surgeon . On Saturday , June 8 . I was sent for to Mr. Perry 's at Hadley , where I found the Deceas 'd extremely ill and speechless . He had received a violent Blow on the Head I let him Blood , he sigh 'd once , and dy 'd in a quarter of an Hour - On the Thursday following the Coroner sent for me . I open 'd the Head of the Deceas 'd , and found a large Contusion and a Fracture of 4 inches on the Temple-bone , a little above the Ear . A Piece of Bone as big as a Hazel-nut was broke quite round . I raised it up , and put a Spatula under it - I believe the Wound was the Cause of his Death . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . The beginning of the Story was this . The Boy came up to the Pond , and I said , You sha n't draw your Cart thro ' the Pond , but take your Horses off , water them and welcome . Upon that , he struck me on the Head with his Whip , and the Deceas 'd and 2 or 3 more stript , and said , God Damn him , let 's knock him on the Head . And then the Deceas 'd struck me with his Whip , and I knock 'd him down . Edward Bolton . I was 20 Yards from the Pond . The Prisoner was going from the Pond , and 3 Men follow 'd him ; 2 of them were stript . He look 'd back , and pacing they got Ground of him ; he run to his House , and somewhere in the Stable he took up this unfortunate Weapon , and then coming to his own Door , he said , Gentlemen stand off ! for I 'll stand in my own Defence . But they made upto him , and he struck the Deceas 'd ; and then one of them struck the Prisoner in the Face . Court . Did the Deceas 'd strike the Prisoner first ? Bolton . I did not see that , but when the Deceas 'd fell , the Prisoner flung down the Dung-fork and went to his own House , but one of them stript , follow 'd him , and several blows past between them . Coroner . How far were you from them when the blow was given ? Bolton . About threescore Yards . Court . And could you hear what was said at that Distance ? Bolton Yes . Court . Who else was near when the blow was struck ? Bolton Thomas Scot was one , and several Carters stopt their Carts . Court . Was Scot before or behind you ? Bolton . Before me . Thomas Scot . There were 4 Carters following the Prisoner as he was making towards his own Door . Court What Carters ? Scot . These 3 Gentlemen here , and the Deceas 'd , they follow 'd him to his own Door - and he turn 'd his Head - And as he was going to his own Door - He met me with this Weapon . Court . Met me with it ? Where ? Scot . Some where or other . Court . At the Door , or within the Door ? Scot . I ca n't say as to that ; but as he was coming along with this unlawful Weapon , he said , Gentlemen , take care , I stand upon my own Defence , and then the Gentlemen - Court . What Gentlemen ? Scot . The Deceas 'd made up to him , and the Prisoner struck him with the Pitch-fork , and then threw it down , and then the Boy struck the Prisoner - The Deceas 'd lay 2 or 3 Minutes , and then got upon his Horse and went to his Team . Court . Did he get up himself ? Scot . He got up , or was hold up . Court . Who was stript ? Scot . Two of the Carters that follow 'd the Prisoner . Court . Was the Deceas 'd stript ? Scot . Yes , he was - No he was not - But the Boy was . Court . How did the Deceas 'd stand when he receiv 'd the blow ? Scot . Upon his Legs - He was unbutton 'd and Rioting with the rest , but he gave no blow . Court . How came you to be there ? Scot . I had been a Haymaking for Mr. Milbourn , and was going home about 4 in the Afternoon ; for we left off Work because it rain 'd . Court . How far was you off when the blow was given ? Scot . 100 Yards . Court . Could you hear what was said at that Distance ? Scot . Yes . Court . Where was Bolton ? Scot . He was with me ; we had both been at work at the same Place , and were going together . Court . Was he behind or before you ? Scot . Behind me . Prisoner . I had no Malice against the Deceas 'd , for I never spoke to him before , and little thought of killing him when I gave him that blow . Several Witnesses gave the Prisoner the Character of a very sober , honest , civil Man , and not subject to be quarrelsome . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 30 , was indicted for Perjury , in swearing that Luke Harbol was indebted to him 3 l. 12 s. for Rent , when the said Luke owed him nothing .

Mary Chetwin , was indicted for stealing 4 silver Spoons , a silver Tankard , a silk Gown , a silk Waistcoat , and 10 Guineas , the Goods and Money of Thomas Carpenter , in his House , Jan. 29 . The Council moved the Court that the Prosecutor might be allow 'd to sit in a Chair while he gave his Evidence , he being so very antient and infirm , that he could not stand without somebody to support him ; which the Court granted . Thomas Carpenter . + I lost a silver Tankard , 5 silver Spoons , a silk Waist-coat , and a silk Gown , and a quantity of Gold , have charged but 10 Guineas , tho ' I lost a great deal more . In last January I receiv 'd about 500 l. from the Bank ; it was in a bag upon a Prayer-Book in the Chimney-corner near the Head of my Couch where I lay , when the Prisoner took a handful of Guineas out of it . + In March last , William Davis , a Boy , was Capitally convicted of stealing from this Prosecutor 20 Guineas , Feb. 8 . See Sessions Paper , Numb . 3. p. 81 . Prisoner . Was not you served with a Copy of a Writ , at the Suit of my Husband , for having Criminal Conversation with me ? Thomas Carpenter . Yes , - I went to bed , and she came to bed to me . Prisoner . And was the Writ served before you charged me with taking your Money ? Thomas Carpenter . Why she would come to Bed to me , and I could not help it . Sarah Patrick , the Prosecutor 's Servant . On the 18th of January my Master had a Sum of Money brought into the House , he told it over , and put it into a Canvas-bag , and laid it upon a Prayer-Book in the right hand Chimney-corner , near his Couch ; then he got out of his Chair , which stood next to the Bag , and went to sleep upon his Couch . The Prisoner , who was then sitting on the left Corner of the Chimney , got out of her Chair and sat in his . I was then in the Yard , and saw her take the Bag and put it into her Lap under a Cambrick Apron that she was mending ; upon which I came in , and ask 'd her where the Bag was ; she said , as it was left to her charge she had taken it into her Lap for fear she should fall asleep , and somebody should come in and steal it . So I went into the Yard again , and peep 'd through a Crevice of the Door , and saw her put her hand into the Bag , and take a handful of Gold out , and put it into her Pocket . Then she ty 'd up the Bag again , and laid it where she took it from . and then moved from my Master 's Chair into her own - My Master had a Green striped Sattin Waistcoat , it was one that his late Wife used to wear ; but she has been dead 9 or 10 Years . I ask 'd the Prisoner , what was become of this Waistcoat ? She said my Master had given it to her , and she had got it at her own House . Court . Did you acquaint your Master with what you saw the Prisoner do ? Patrick . Yes , a Week or ten Days afterwards , I desir 'd him to look into his Bag . Court . But why did you not speak of it sooner ? Patrick . I was afraid of the Prisoner , for she bore a great Sway in the House - She was a sort of a Housekeeper , and often threaten 'd to turn us away ; but when I had told my Master , he turn 'd her away in two or three Days after . Prisoner . I did not live constantly in the House , but came once or twice a Week , and sometimes was there a Week together . I had no settled Wages , but took what he pleas 'd to give me . Juryman . Was the Writ serv 'd before or after she was turn 'd away ? Patrick . It was after . Jury . Was it before she was indicted ? Patrick . Yes . Mrs. Goodcheap . The Prisoner 's Husband ow 'd me above 12 l. - above a Year ago the Prisoner promis 'd to pay me 20 s. of it at such a Time , and when that time came , she brought me 15 s. and desir 'd me to take this silk Gown , 'till she paid me the other 5 s. Prisoner . The Prosecutor gave me that Gown . Carpenter . This was my Wife 's Gown , I never gave it the Prisoner , nor to any Body else . Thomas Evans , Headborough . The Day the Prisoner was sent to Newgate , I had a Warrant to search for a silver Tankard , 5 silver Spoons , a silk Gown , and this green silk quilted Waistcoat , and this I found in her Closet . Prisoner , to the Prosecutor . Did not you give me this Waistcoat ? Carpenter . No , no , no . Prisoner . Did you ever give me any thing ? Carpenter . I had no need to give you any thing , for you could steal fast enough . Prisoner . Do you know one Mary Freeborn ? Carpenter . I think I have heard of such a Name - Aye , she 's your Mother . Prisoner , to Evans . Did you never reproach me for keeping Company with Mr. Carpenter ? Evans . I have said , that what you had must come from him ; for I knew you when you had ne'er a Gown to your Back , nor a Smock to you - and you would not work to get any . Mary Harris . About a Year ago the Prisoner pawn 'd a silver Tankard to me for 6 l. she said it was Mr. Carpenter 's Sister 's - I think it was mark 'd T , E , and a C at top . I can swear to the T , but not to the other Letters - I was very timbersome of taking it in , because it look 'd very black ; but she said , that was only because it had been laid up - She fetch 'd it away about 3 Months ago . Mary Carpenter . I know my Uncle had such a Tankard mark 'd T , C , E. Thomas Carpenter . Yes , I had , and I never dispos 'd of it to any Body . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . The old Gentleman would never let me rest 'till I left my own Family , and came to his House . I had his Orders to take Money out of the Bag , and pay it upon his Account ; as for the Gown and Waist-coat , and a great many other Things , he gave them to me freely . I have often wore them in his Company - Mrs. Carpenter , did not Mr. Carpenter bid me pay you 24 l 5 s. that Day as it was said I stole the Money . Mary Carpenter . Yes . I was fetch 'd over to take the Money - My Uncle and the Prisoner were sitting together , he was in his great Chair , next to the Chimney Corner . He bid her take the Money and pay me , and so she did - His Maid , Sarah Patrick , was in the Room at the same time . Court , to the Prosecutor . Did you give the Prisoner Orders to pay that Money ? Tho . Carpenter . No , no , no , I remember no Orders . Court , to Mary Carpenter . On what Account did you receive that Money ? Mary Carpenter . I keep a Chandler's-shop , and the Money was due to me for Goods and for Money that I lent him . For he often us 'd to send to me for a Guinea or 10s . when he wanted Money , and had none in the House . Court . Did you deliver a Bill of what he ow 'd you , or give a Receipt for what he paid ? Mary Carpenter . No , no , my Book was one side of the House - I set up what he ow 'd me with Chalk , and the Prisoner took an Account of it - The old Gentleman is much impair 'd with Age - I believe he did not rightly apprehend the last Question that was put to him - Mr. Carpenter , did not you owe me some Money ? Thomas Carpenter . Yes , yes ; I have borrow 'd Money of her a hundred times . Mary Carpenter . And did not you give the Prisoner orders to pay me ? Thomas Carpenter . Yes , I order 'd her to pay you for Chalk against the Wall . Prisoner , to Sarah Partridge . Did not you hear him order me to take ten Guineas out of the Bag and put into his Pocket ? - and to take Money to pay the Brewer and Mary Carpenter . Sarah Patrick . He order 'd you to pay the Money , but not to put it into your own Pocket . - The ten Guineas was taken first , and then the 24l . for Mary Carpenter ; but the Money then lay upon the Table , and was not put into the Bag , and this was about 12 a-clock ; but it was two Hours after when you took the handful of Gold for yourself . Prisoner . But did not he give me Directions to pay Money , when he lay upon his Couch ? Patrick . I believe he might , but not to pay it to yourself . Mary Freeborn , the Prisoner 's Mother . This silk Gown the Prosecutor gave to my Daughter on Sunday Night when I was present - And this quilted Waistcoat he gave her at another time , when she was to sit up with Mrs. Purnell , who was ill . Indeed I did not see him give her the Gown upon her Back ; but she had it on one day when we were at his House , and he said , Mother , ( for he call 'd me Mother ) see how fine I have made your Daughter ! this was my Wife 's wedding Gown ; and he took her with him to his House in the Country . Eliz . May . I have seen her up and down about is Business in his Wife 's Clothes . Margaret Powis . I never knew any harm of her ; but she had a scandalous Character by going to and fro to his House , and wearing his Wife 's Clothes ; and that made a difference betwixt her and her Husband . John Freeborn . I was often at the Prosecutor 's House ; but one time when I was there , 't is about 3 Years ago - he call 'd me Brother , and ask 'd me , if I was willing to give my Sister away in Marriage to him , and I said , Yes , and then he kiss 'd her , and - Jury . And what ? John Freeborn . Nothing - Court . You knew she was a marry 'd Woman at the same time ? John Freeborn . Yes . Sarah Chapman . The Prosecutor brought her to my Shop - I keep a Fish-shop in Redriff , and he lives at Blackwall - He gave me a Guinea to fetch a Quart of Brandy to make Punch . But she said , What need you change , when I have got Silver ? Have you Moll ? says he , then give her two Shillings , for it 's all one betwixt you and I - They din 'd and drank Punch together . He had dress 'd up Moll . in his Wife 's Clothes , and ask 'd me how I lik 'd her , and how I should like him for a new Kinsman ? And I said , That 's according as you like , Sir . Ann Webb . The Prosecutor 's Man has come Night and Day to fetch her from my House . Edward Wilmer . The Prisoner 's Husband employ 'd me to bring an Action against the Prosecutor . I made out a Writ on the 23d of May , and understanding that he was a very elderly Gentleman , Curiosity led me to serve it my self . I found him at home with Mary Carpenter , Sarah Patrick , and a Boy . Says I , It 's a very odd thing , that a Man of your Age should be sued on such an Occasion as this . I do n't know how it is , says he , but she would come to Bed to me I think . Then , says Mary Carpenter , her Husband did not demand her of my Uncle , but of me , and I secreted her ; but if I was my Uncle , I would be reveng 'd - She has gone to Bed to to him several Times . Council . Was that all the Discourse that pass 'd ? Edward Wilmer . No ; but it was all the Discourse I had with him , for he did not own any thing ; but only said that she would come to Bed to him - Patrick said they had lost silver Spoons , and they would be reveng 'd - Court . And would you serve such a Writ on such an old Man ? Edward Wilmer . I have a Right to serve a Writ on him or any other , and I do n't poubt but we shall prove it upon him when it comes to be try 'd - I ask 'd the Prisoner if the Prosecutor had hir 'd her for a Servant ? She said , No . I ask 'd her , how she could prove he was a-bed with her ? How Mr Carpenter seduc 'd her ? and how - But my Client will make all out at a proper Time . John Wells . Patrick said the Spoons were taken away , and they would be reveng 'd on Mrs. Chetwin . Several Witnesses appear 'd to the Prisoner 's Character ; they depos 'd , that they knew no harm of her , any farther than keeping Company with the Prosecutor . The Jury acquitted her . 34 , 35.

Prisoner . If this Evidence and I were so intimate , he should know the Marks of my Face . Howard . I do n't know that you have any particular Marks . Prisoner . No ! why here 's a great Scar down my Forehead - It 's plain enough to be seen - Do you know how many Eyes I have got ? Howard . Why two Eyes , how many would you have ? Prisoner . I have got but one - It 's a Sign how well you know me . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 37.

Acquitted . 39. , was indicted for assaulting , ravishing , and against her Will carnally knowing Betteridge the Wife of John May , January 19 . . On Saturday the 19th of January last , about 5 in the Evening , the Prisoner came to my House - 't is a Lone-house on Enfield-chase - And ask 'd if my Husband was come home ? I said No . He said he wonder 'd at that , for he gave him leave to come home sooner than ordinary on Saturdays - The Prisoner is a Master Carpenter , and belongs to the New-River Works and my Husband is his Man - I kept game Fowls for the Prisoner . He gave Six pence to my Boy , who was 12 Years old , and bid him take care of the Fowls ; and Six-pence more to my Child that was sucking at my Breast , and left another Six pence for my other Child who was not at home : Then , says he , your Husband told me he had got fine Pigs , and promised to make me a present of one ; but I : will pay him for it . He said they were fine ones , and I am come to look upon them . The Sow and Pigs were in the Stable , and so I took a Candle and went with him thither , we came thro ' 2 Doors , which he shut after him , and then came into the Stable . Court . How far is the Stable from the House ? Betteridge May . About as far as a cross this Court - I was afraid the Pigs would run out ; and so shut the Stable-door Council . Did not he lock the Door ? Betteridge May . I ca n't say whether it was lock 'd , or only upon the latch - He look 'd upon the Sow and Pigs , and said they were fine ones ; and then he laid hold of me , beat the Candle out , and threw me down upon a Couple of Faggots , and had to do with me - I cry 'd for help , but he put a Hankerchief into my Mouth , and used me so violently that I could make no Noise ; but the Sow and Pigs cry 'd out , and made a terrible racket . Court . Say what he did to you . Betteridge . He lay with me with great Violence . Council . How ? Betteridge May . He pull 'd up my Coats . Council . And what then ? Betteridge May . He made use of what he had , and put it into my Body . Council . What d 'ye call that ? Betteridge May . His Yard . Court . Did he do all that was necessary on his part towards getting a Child ? Betteridge . Yes . Court . Could he possibly do that if you would not comply ? Betteridge May . Yes , He did it against my Will . Court . I do n't find that he made use of any means to terrify you - Betteridge No . Court . Then would not the least motion of yours have prevented him from doing as you say ? Betteridge May . It was not in my Power . Court . The Jury will judge of that - you were but a little way from the House , and if I understood you , the Prisoner did not stop your Mouth till after he had thrown you down . You say you cry 'd out before that , but did you cry loud enough for your Boy to hear you ? Betteridge May . I believe he might have heard me , if the Pigs had not made such a Noise - When the Prisoner had got his will , he said I should not go out in such a great flurry ; and he did all he could to pacify me . I hope says he , you wo n't tell your Husband ; but if you do , I 'll turn him out of his Work , and lay him in a Jail for what he owes me . - My Husband ow 'd him 7 Guineas and a half , and therefore , tho ' my Husband came home that Night , I did not acquaint him with it . Court . But if the Prisoner had been convicted of so great an Offence , he must have been hang 'd for it ; and therefore your Husband would have been out of Danger . Betteridge May . I know nothing of the Law . Council . Did not you prefer an Indictment against the Prisoner at Hicks's-Hall in February last for a Rape ? Betteridge May . Yes ; but on account of some Objections the Bill was not found . Council . And then you indicted him for an Assault with an intent to Ravish ? Betteridge May . Yes , but he got off . Council . Tho ' it was but for an Assault , you gave the same Evidence as now ; and swore a compleat Rape - How long was it before you acquainted your Husband with this affair ? Betteridge May . Not till the Wednesday 7 Night after it was done : Tho ' I soon found myself very much out of order , and had a violent Pain in my Back - On the 30th of January I apply 'd to an Apothecary , and have been under his care ever since . Council . How came you to discover it at last ? Betteridge May . My Husband went to Work on the Monday Morning , and that Night the Prisoner came and enquired for me ; but I was a bed , and so he went away : But he came again on the Wednesday , and ask 'd me if I had told my Husband ? I answer 'd No , I have not told him yet - I am glad of that , says he , and I hope you wo n't do it ; but I was afraid you had , because he has not come up for his Wages ; there is 10s due to him for 5 days Work ; and now I 'm here I 'll pay the Money to you ; so he gave me half a Guinea . I told him I could not give him Change ; and he said it was no Matter , for I might keep the Six-pence for my self . On Thursday I receiv 'd a message to meet my Husband the next Day at Mrs. Aylet 's , the Bird in hand at Waltham-cross . I did not know the meaning of it , but was afraid my Husband had met with another mischance , for once he put his Collar-bone out - So on Friday I went , though I was very ill , and the Woman of the House led me up stairs into a Room , where there was a Fire , but no Company . She said she kept a Fire there to dry Bacon . Presently the Prisoner came up with a Whip in his Hand , and said , by God you are all taken ! I ask 'd him if my Husband was there . He answer d No , It was I that sent for you ; and God Damn it you shall stay Dinner ; and if you make any disturbance here , it will be the worse for you ; for I have got a pair of Pistols - A Fowl and Bacon was brought ; but I had no Stomach , and could not eat any thing . After Dinner , I took my Hat and was going ; but he said I should not ; and so he laid 2 Pistols on the Table , shut the Door , stuck his Penknife into it , and hung his Great-coat upon it ; and then threw me upon the Bed , and used me as he did before in the Stable . Court . What did he Ravish you a second Time ? - And this in the middle of the Day , and at a Publick-house too ? Betteridge May . Yes he did , though I call 'd out - as I did before - But nobody came to help me - The Prisoner said , You may tell your Husband of this if you will ; for now you come after me : And so I came away . Court . Why did not you apprehend the Prisoner then ? Was there ne'er a Constable in the Town ? Betteridge May . I was so ill , that I could not go to look for a Constable , but went di-directly home . Court . Did not you know it was the Prisoner that sent for you to that House . Betteridge May . No . Court . Who did you ask for when you came thither ? Betteridge May . Nobody I went by the Door , before I enquir 'd for the Bird-in-hand ; and the Woman of the House was then at the Window , and saw me , and so she came to the Door . Court . Did she know you then ? Betteridge May . No , I believe she had never seen me before , but the Prisoner had described my Riding-hood to her . Court . Upon your Oath did not you enquire for Mr. - ? Betteridge May . No , upon my Oath - My Husband came home the next Day , which was Saturday ; but I had such a Dread upon my Spirits , that I was afraid to tell him . Court . How came you to tell him at last ? Betteridge May . I grew so bad , that I knew not how to conceal it any longer . Council . Did you send a Pig to the Prisoner on the Sunday Morning ? Betteridge May . No , but my Husband did before I was up ; for I was ill a Bed : But when he told me of it , I said , I wish 'd he had not done it - There 's a Bill against the Prisoner at Hertford for this last Fact - 'T is for an Assault with an intent to Ravish . Court . Why for an Assault only , whereas you swear the Fact was compleated . Betteridge May . I did not understand the Law , but I told my Attorney how I was serv 'd . Attorney . She told me it was only an Assault . Prisoner . On the 19th of January was any Body in your House besides your Children ? Betteridge May . Not in my House , but in the Next there was a Man and a Woman , and a Girl ; and they might hear me cry out , but I believe they thought it was the Pigs . Prisoner . She let me out afterwards , and bid me good Night - Her Mouth was not stopt then ; but she made no complaint to any Body . John May . I have work 'd for the Prisoner near 9 Years , and indeed he has been a good friend to me . I owed him 7 Guineas and a half . I came home between 9 and 10 on Saturday Night , my Boy told me my Master - had been there , and given him and his Brother Six-pence a piece . My Wife said nothing of this Matter to me ; and I had no mistrust of her or the Prisoner , for I knew nothing of their Contrigues . So I went to work again on Monday , and on Thursday the Prisoner came and said , do you go home to Night , John ? - if you do , you shall never strike another stroke for me . Why , Sir ? says I ; where will be the harm as long as I keep my Time ? Prisoner . But you had neglected your time very much by going home a Nights . John May . So I did not go home till Saturday Night , and then my Wife was very ill , and complain 'd of a Pain in her Back , and said she believ 'd she had got a Fever ; and she cry 'd - I had promised a Pig to the Prisoner , and so I sent one in the Morning before she was up : and he sent me half a Crown for it - On the Wednesday Night following I was very urgent to do what married Men should do ; but she refused : And I insisted upon knowing the meaning of it ; and so she was forced to confess , or else she had given it to me . She said that the Prisoner went with her into the Stable to see the Pigs , but did not lock the Door , and then threw her upon the Faggots and lay with her by force ; but she said nothing of the second Fact , till after I had got a Warrant for him ; and then she told me , and said she did not tell me sooner for fear I should turn her quite out of Doors . John May , the Son . I heard a Noise when my Mother and the Prisoner were in the Stable , but I thought it had been the Sow and Pigs ; and when my Mother came in she had a high Colour , her Cap was tumbled , and her Hair about her Ears - Before they went into the Stable , the Prisoner sent me to get his Horse out of the Stable for fear he should hurt the Pigs - But Mr. Newman took the Horse out and put into the Wash-house . Rebecca Newman . Our House joins to Mrs May 's : I remember the Night the Prisoner was there , and saw them both go into the Stable ; they staid there about half an Hour -I heard no squeeling nor crying - But we were spinning and our Wheels made a Noise . He came out of the Stable alone , and in a little Time he mounted his Horse and went away ; but did not see her come out - The next Night she complained to me of a Pain in her Back , and a burning within - I ask 'd her if it was a Fever ? and she said No , I never was so in my Life . Joseph Newman . I fetch 'd the Horse out of the Stable , and put him into the Washhouse ; but I do n't know who fetch 'd him out of the Wash-house when the Prisoner went away , for I did not see him go - On Tuesday Night following between 8 and 9 the Prisoner came to the Door and whistled . I look 'd out , and he asked if Mrs. May was within - She is gone to Bed , says I ; shall I call her ? No , says he , it 's no matter . The Prisoner 's Defence . Elizabeth Aylet . I keep the Bird-in-hand at Waltham-cross - On Friday Morning the Prisoner was at my House . About 9 the Prosecutrix knock 'd at the Door ( tho ' the Door was open ) and said , Is one Mr. - here ? I said , Yes he 's in the Kitchen with some Men , will you please to go in ? No , said she , if there is Company I had rather you 'll call him out . Court . She swore that she did not ask for him or any body . Elizabeth Aylet . She ask 'd for him by Name ; and so I shew 'd her into the Parlour , and told him ; but he was smoaking his Pipe , and did not come presently . She complain 'd there was no Fire in the Parlour , and so I led her up stairs - The Prisoner came up and said , So ! So ! have I catch 'd you napping ? Then he saluted her , and call 'd for a Quartern of Brandy . She drank a little of it , but she chose to have a hot Pot , and so I made one , and after that another ; they seem 'd to be very friendly , and abundance of pretty Compliments past between them - He said she was an old Acquaintance that he had met on the Road , and would treat her with what the House afforded . I told them I had Bacon an Eggs , - No - Or Salt Fish and Eggs - No - Or a Pullet full of Eggs - Aye , says she , that will do ; and he bid me get it ready ; and so I did , and she eat part of a Wing - They sat at the Foot of the Bed , and I left them several times together , for I thought no harm . Council . Had he any Pistols ? Elizabeth Aylet . Yes , and he laid them on the Chest of Drawers ; for he usually laid them down when he came in . Council How came it that he did not lay them down in the Kitchen ? Elizabeth Aylet . Because he was just a-going , but it raining a little , he sat down to smoak a Pipe , and was in the Kitchen about an Hour with 2 other Men . James Jarvis . John May came several times after me , to desire me to go and make this matter up : I ask 'd him how he came to Prosecute so good a Master ? He answer 'd ; he has been a very good Master ; and if my Wife had told me the Truth at first , I would have gone another way to work . went to the Prisoner , who said , I know nothing of it ; but he owes me a little Money , and I suppose this is some Trick . So I went again to John May , and ask 'd him what he meant by beginning such a Prosecution as might take away his Master 's Life . He said , No , I do n't design that - But that will be the consequence , says I , if the Fact is proved . No , says he again , if it should come to that , I would not appear . Council . The Woman do n't pretend that the Prisoner made use of any Threats to terrify her , and therefore she had Liberty to call out for help ; and she might have cry 'd loud enough to have been heard ; but it does not appear that any Body heard her . The Jury acquitted him . 40. Richard Dubois , was indicted for the Murder of John Dubois , by giving him , with a Sword , one mortal Wound in the right Breast half an Inch long and 12 Inches deep , May 10 . of which Wound he languished till next day , and then dy 'd . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for Manslaughter . Mr Bilson . As I was riding down Primrose-hill by Tottenham-court , I saw two Men in their Shirts in a Field at a little Distance , and thought I perceiv 'd the glittering of a Sword : I turn 'd my Horse in at the Gate , and they were then got a-fighting ; says I , do you know what you are about ; do you know the consequence ? the Prisoner retreated , and the Deceas 'd push 'd him almost into the Ditch , and then stood strong on his Longe with his Sword full , thus - And said Allons ! Allons ! The Prisoner said , I 'll fight you no more , for I believe you have got it - This is your own seeking , you forced me to it . Then they spoke French . I saw some Blood run from the Deceased 's Back , under his Shoulder The Prisoner put his Sword up , and the Deceas 'd put his Clothes on , and said to the Prisoner , give me my Hat and Wig . Aye , says the Prisoner , if you 'll give me or that Gentleman your Sword first , for I wo n't trust my Life in your hands . Then the Deceas 'd took up his own Hat and Wig , and we all went into the Lane The Deceas 'd appear 'd still full of Resentment , and therefore the Prisoner would not walk before him , but said , my dear Dubois ( for they were both of the same Name , and both Masters of the Sword ) if you will go before , I will take care of you ; but I wo n't trust you behind me - You know you forced me to it . The Deceas 'd made no answer ; but to end the difference , I went between them , the Prisoner being on my right hand and the Deceas 'd on my left : He bled very much ; and so we went to the bottom of the Lane , and then I turn 'd back . Charles Dennis , Surgeon . Between 3 and 4 a Clock the Prisoner came in a Chair to my House in Panton Square - He said he had walked two Miles from Berwick-Street , before he could get a Chair , and bled all the Way . He desir 'd I would go home and dress him ; but I advis 'd him not to go home in that bloody Condition he was in , for fear of frightening his Wife . I saw the Wound was Mortal , it pass 'd above the Right-breast , and below the Collar-bone , and cut the auxillary great blood Vessel that goes to the Arm . He still seem 'd to retain some Animosity against the Person that had wounded him , tho ' he would not name him , but said he had not done , if a Man on Horseback had not come up while they were fighting - The Deceas 'd dy 'd next Day , and the loss of Blood was the cause of it . Several Gentlemen of the Blade depos 'd , That the Prisoner was a peaceable inoffensive Man , and gave a different Character of the Deceas 'd . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaugter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 41. Mary Butler , was indicted for privately stealing 14 Guineas and 20 s. from the Person of John Taylor , June 3 . John Taylor . About 11 at Night I met the Prisoner and another Woman by Temple-Bar , they ask 'd me to give them a Glass of Wine , and I indiscretely went with them to a Tavern . The Money was in a Bag in my Coat Pocket . We stay 'd a Quarter of an Hour , I paid for the Wine , and as the Women were going out , I miss 'd my Money , and call 'd out to stop them ; but none of the People of the House regarded my calling - The Women fell a running , and I follow 'd them . One of them got off , but the Prisoner was stopt at the End of Cary-Street by the Constable and Watch - But I had not the Prudence to have her search 'd . Prisoner . I never saw the Man 's Face before he stopp 'd me in the Street , and said I was like a Woman that had robb 'd him . Acquitted . 42.

The Prisoner came for some Small-beer and a Dram . Betty , says I , 't is a busy Time ( for it was Saturday Morning ) and therefore do n't trouble me . So she went to that Part of the Shop where the Money lay , and serv 'd herself , and then walk 'd backwards and forwards a good while , and then went away . I miss 'd the Money in half an Hour after she was gone , and suspected her , because no Body else was at that End of the Counter while the Money lay there . Richard Grove . I met the Prisoner in the Afternoon in Theobald 's Row . She held up a blue and white strip 'd Cap , and shook at me , and said , Hey ! you Son of of a Bitch here 's Money ! John Kilsby .

At Night I heard Mr Dixon had been robb 'd by such a Woman ; and she was taken next Morning in her Room - She swore prodigiously , and damn 'd her Eyes if she knew any thing of the Matter ; but when she was told of her being at the King's-Head , and spending and throwing the Money about there she confess 'd that is was Mr. Dixon 's Money , and that she took it out of his Shop but she had none of it left , for she had spent it and thrown it away , she could not tell how .
