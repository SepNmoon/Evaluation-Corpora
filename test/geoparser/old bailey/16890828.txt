The Business was thus : Two of these Dutch Men were drinking in Harman 's Quarters and took occasion ( being in Drink ) to begin a Quarrel with the Prosecutor Jennaway , the Father of the Child , and some Neighbors that were drinking there , calling them Papists ; and abused them in a most egre ious manner , drawing their Knives , Swords and pistols , endeavouring to murther them . And Harman was left in the Kitchen alone , ( where the Child lay in a Cradle asleep ) with his Sword drawn and upon a sudden the Child was heard to screek out , and immediately after was found dead in the Cradle .

And upon Oath it was made out , that Harman was only in the Room with his Sword drawn where the Child lay , and the Child dyed of the Wound received . The Court , and all that heard it , resented it as a most villainous Act , and base Murther that was hardly to be parallel 'd ; so upon a full Hearing on both sides , no Evidence was produced to fasten the Murther upon Pepper-maker and Degrove , so they were acquitted ; but Harman was found guilty of wilful Murther .
