AN ACCOUNT Of the most remarkable TRYALS At the Sessions house in the Old bayly . THe Tryals and Condemnations or Acquittals of the several Malefactors at Justice-Hall in the Old-bayly London , having proved very acceptable , we have thought good to continue their publications ; this Sessions being as remarkable as others : and is as followeth . There was a Victualler tried for killing a Man ; they fought very fiercely together , and the Man went home : The Evidence swore that the Victualler was the cause of his Death , who had bruised him sore in several parts , and had caused him to spit Blood ; but in regard he died a Moneth after , and was indifferently well : The Jewry acquitted the Prisoner of the Murther . There was a Young man tried for stealing of a Saw , the Prosecutor made Affidavit , That that Saw which was found in the Young mans custody was his : The Young man brought a Joyner , that swore he made him the frame of the Saw , half a year ago ; whereas the Prosecutor swore , that his was stolen a year ago : So that the Youngman was discharged of the Crime . There was a lusty young Fellow , John Smith by Name , tried for the sacriligious stealing of above Two Hundred Pounds worth of Plate , out of the Vestry of St. Giles 's Church . The Beadle of the Parish suspected this man , because he was a loose Liver , and came to his Lodging , but found him not within : He asked his Neighbour for him , and he said , That at Nine of the Clock at Night he was within , but since he had not seen him . The Beadle promised him Ten Shillings , to b ing him word , when he was within ; but the other when he saw him , told the Prisoner what the Beadle said ; then he came not to his Lodging in a Months time : But at his return , he had notice given him by others , and he took a Constable with him , and came to his Chamber-door , and rushed against it , designing to break it open , but he could not . The Prisoner hearing it , got up , and asked , Who was there ? The Beadle told him , That he was suspected for stealing away the Church-plate , and they had a Warrant to apprehend him . The Prisoner then told him , He was a Son of a Bitch , and he had nothing to say to him : And whilst they were breaking open the Door , he run up into a Garret , and got up upon the House , and ran along several houses in his Shirt only , when they found he was fled , they made it their business to catch him : And in order thereto a Youth was sent up , and at the end of the House he spied him : when he approached near , he said , You Son of a Bitch , get you gone , or I will split your Brains with a Tile ; this nothing daunted him , for he returned the same expression to him , but presently he came running by the Youngman , and then there was the Beadle , that lay in ambush for him , so that he leaped out of the Frying-pan into the Fire . He that Scylia seeks to shun , Doth often on Charibdis run . When he was thus backset and foreset , he could not hope for a release , but by the danger of breaking his Neck , so that he unwillingly became their Captive . At his Indictment he would not-plead , because a man was to give Evidence against him , that was a Party concerned ; so that when nothing would prevail to make him plead , he was sentenced to be prest to Death : But through the Sheriffs Intercession , he was perswaded to plead ; and then the Court would hardly be perswaded to revoke the Sentence but upon his Knees he entreated them very importunately : at last they condisecinded to grant him more favour than he did deserve , viz . A legal Trial ; and then it was proved , that he was one of the three that broke in . There was an Iron-betty shewed , and some small pieces of the Plate , that were found in a house where the Plate was sold by his and their orders : It was proved that he was one of the three , that hid the plate in a Ditch , and received an equal share of the Money . And the Woman that had it of them , sold it to another for Three Shil . Eight Pen . an Ounce : so that the Jury could do no less than find him guilty of the Fact . There was a Youngman and his supposed Wife that were Arraigned for stealing of Thirty pair of Cloath-coloured Stockins : He ( understanding there were many other Indictments against him ) pleaded guilty to all Felonies within the benefit of Clergy : But she refused to plead , saying , That she was his Wife , and therefore bound to keep his secrets but at last she pleaded , she was acquitted , and he found guilty . There were Three Shoe-makers arraigned for Murthering a Young Woman ; they went towards Kentish-Town , and there they spied her with Milk : One of them asked for some to drink ; But she would not give them any : They gave and received some provoking words , which stird them up to blowes ; several of her Acquaintance took her part , and routed the Shoe-makers . But before her Assistants came in , she hadgotten some bruises . This was on Friday , and she died on the Mundy following . They were acquitted both of the Murder and Manslaughter ; and they owe great thanks to a merciful Middlesex Jury . There was a Souldier tryed for stealing away a Marble-stone of the value of eighteen shillings from Scotland-yard : It was proved that he laid it on the Porters back and proffered to sell it ; so that the Jury could do no less than finde him guilty of petty Larceny , and that was a favour too , for they might have brought him in guilty of Felony , and then he would have been one step more nearer related to Tyburn . There was likewise two men more tried for the stealing of St. Giles 's Plate : one was the Smith that made the Betty , to whose house they carried the Plate , who pleaded innocency at the bar , but there was one of the Thieves that gave Evidence against all the rest , that swore he had made above twenty Betties : He then said , he never had any knowledge of any Betty but his Wife , they were both found guilty . A Woman was tried for murthering her Child : Two or three made Oath , that she said the Child was still-born , and afterwards she threw it into a Pond , in regard the Ground was so hard that she could not digg a hole to bury it in ; but in regard she did not discover her being with Childe to any , nor call any in at the birth of the Childe . She was found guilty by the Jury according to an Act of Parliament in King Edward 's time . There was a Youth , who appeared to be about seventeen years of Age , indicted for a Robbery : for that he and two more robbed a young man a little beyond Islington of about eight pounds in Money . It was about eight of the clock in the evening in March last . The Prosecutor knew this youth but durst take no notice of him for fear they should have killed him ; for the Moon did shine bright , insomuch that he could discern him as well by that as a clear light ; and therefore he was very positive and confident in his affirmation . Notwithstanding several came in to testifie that at that hour when he was accused of the Robbery , he was at the Musick in Whitechappel , but he was found guilty . There was a young man tryed for a Burglary commited at Thistlemorth , he took out of a house two Flitches of bacon several pounds of beef , a leg of pork , and some wearing clothes , but he that was accused was acquitted , because they only made Oath that he was there in the morning , and this was done in the night following ; he drank a pot of beere in the house , and looked up into the Chimney where the bacon hung , and commended it for good bacon , he had formerly suffered for such like misdemeanours ; and that was one reason why he was suspected , his commending the bacon might be another ; but the greatest was , because they found the wyth which he that owned the bacon , made near the house where the prisoner lodged , which was at least two miles from the place where the fact was committed . There were two women indicted for stealing a piece of Silk from a Mercer in the City , but they were not both arraigned , for one of them was brought a bed of a Newgate bird ; and the other refused her tryal , because her sister Shop lift could not come to take her tryal , but at last she took a tryal , and the other too : she was acquitted , the other found guilty of this , and was burn 'd in the hand last Sessions . There was an honest Country man tryed for stealing a Calf ; but it was another that stole it , and sold it to him ; who confest it at the Barr , so that the other was acquitted , and the Prosecutor blamed for indicting him that bought it ; but he excused himself , by saying that the other was not taken when he was indicted . Thus you see , the righteous oft suffer for the sinners sake There was two young men tryed for breaking open a Merchant s house , and both brought in guilty of the fact . Another young man was arraigned for Murther , he and two more were throwing stones at one another in Clerkenwell-Green , and it was his hard misfortune to be too good a marks man , for he hit one of them under the ear , and he dyed within three days , so that he was found guilty of Manslaughter . There was a young man tryed and found guilty for the felonious taking away of several goods and some mony out of some Trunks , which he broke , which were locked in his Landladie s Chamber . There was a woman found guilty of stealing away a silver Tankard from her Master . Sixteen condemn 'd , five burned in the hand ; And five Transplanted to some other Land : Seven ordered to be whipt , and one was fin 'd , The Fine was small , because the Court was kind . Each of their Crimes were great , therefore I doubt ; There will be mighty work for Ketch this bout : Good Lord deliver all as well as me , From Ketches mercy , and the Tripple Tree .
