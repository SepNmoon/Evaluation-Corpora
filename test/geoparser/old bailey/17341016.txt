Christian Clark . About 3 in the Afternoon , as I was coming from the Pyed Bull , in May-Fair , I was met in the Fields by the Prisoner and another Man . I had some Pewter Spoons in a Basket , and the Prisoner stopt me , and said , Damn your Blood , what do you sell such Spoons as these for ? They are not good Metal , and so he took 2 Dozen and 2 from me , and gave them to his Companion , who went off with them , and I ran away : but the Prisoner follow 'd me to Carnaby-Market , and abused me very much , and I cry 'd out for my Life , and a Mob got about us ; but for all that , he took another Spoon from me there Rolus Bolus , in the Presence of all the People . Court . When was this ? Clark . I have forgotten the Day of the Month effegs ; but it was about 3 Weeks ago , and upon my crying out , the Prisoner was taken and carry 'd before the Justice . John Wing . On the 25th of September , I saw the Prisoner assault the Prosecutor in Carnaby-Street , and she hung by his Arm , and cry 'd , and said he had robb 'd her in May-Fair , and she wanted a Constable ; and I saw him take one Spoon out of her Basket . He pretended her Spoons were bad Metal , and that she has no Power to sell them , because she had not got a Licence to hawk them . I took the Spoon out of his Hand , and advised him to make her Satisfaction for the Spoons he had taken from her in May-Fair , and so to go about his Business , and not oblige her to prosecute him . Edward Greenwell . I saw the Prisoner take the Spoon from her at a Tin sho Door in Carnaby Street ; Mr Wing advised him to make her Satisfaction ; but he refused , and so he was carry 'd before Justice Lambert , where he was required to discover his Companion . He said he knew where he was , but he would not tell us . Prisoner . I saw this Woman first by the Turn-Stile in Band street she sighed , and said , she had been at the Pyed Bull , an there they had broke her of two Dozen of Spoons . What Spoons ? says I . And then she shew 'd me one . I ask 'd her the Price , and she told me 18 d. a Dozen . I let her know that I belong 'd to the Trade , and if the Spoons were good Metal , and she came honestly by them , she could not afford to sell them at that Price . Whereupon she run away , and I afterwards happen 'd to call in at a Gin-shop in Carnaby-Market , and while I was there , this Woman came by , and so I goes to her , to know what Authority she had to hawk such Goods . You are one of the Rogues that sells Buttons about the Streets , says she , and then she flew upon me , and struck me in the Face , and then taking up one of her Spoons , she said , See here , you Rogue , here is my Spoon , I neither stole it nor is it bad Metal ; and what has such a Rogue as you to do with it ? I took the Spoon out of her Hand to look at it , and then John Wing said , Now by God she shall swear a Robbery against you . A great Mob gather 'd about us , and they took her part more than mine , and so I was carry 'd before Justice Lambert , and committed to the Round-house . As for what she says of the 2 Dozen of Spoons , I never touched 'em , for I meddled with none but that one Spoon as she shewed me in Carnaby-Market . Elizabeth Mac Claghan . The Prosecutor sold two Spoons to a Woman at my Cellar-door for 6 d. and two old Spoons . I said it was too dear , upon which the Prosecutor swore that I stole some Spoons out of her Basket .

I have known the Prisoner 18 or 20 Years , I am a Brasier , and I have trusted him in my Shop 8 Years , and always found him very honest . William Williams .

About 4 o'Clock on Saturday in the Afternoon , as I was smoaking my Pipe at an opposite Neighbour 's Door , when I saw the Prisoner and another Woman go into my Shop , the Indian Queen in Crispin-street ; and by and by they came out again , and the Prisoner went up an Entry , and the other Woman went another way . Susan Delahaze . I and my Daughter were in the Shop . The Prisoner and another Woman came in , and asked for some Cambletee for a Gown : We agreed for a Shilling a Yard , and then the Prisoner bid me cut off 12 Yards , which I did . Then she felt a good while in her Bosom with her left Hand for her Money , and the same time fumbled under her Apron with her right Hand . I suppose she was hiding the piece of Cambletee . Then she said she had left her Purse at home ; and so she laid down half a Crown earnest , and said she would go home for her Purse and come again presently ; but as she and her Companion were going out at the Door I mist the piece of Cambletee ; the other Woman run up the Street , and the Prisoner into an Entry ; I follow 'd her , and brought her back , she said she had got nothing , but the piece was afterwards found in that Entry . Susan Everton . As I was going to wash our Entry , I found this piece of Stuff behind our half Door ; and hearing that the Prosecutor had lost such a piece , I carried it to his House , and delivered it to the Constable who was there . Joseph Brown . I examin 'd the Prisoner , she said she did not take it out of the Shop , but that the other Woman took it ; and that if I went into the Entry perhaps I might find it . But it was brought in by Susan Everton about an Hour after it was lost . The Jury found her Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 4.

John Par . I am a Pawnbroker , the Prisoner was Nurse to my Boy , she had been with me 4 Months , and last Saturday was 3 Weeks she went away Sick . After which there was a Quarrel betwixt her and one of her Companions ; and thereupon I was inform 'd that several of my Things had been seen in her Box at her Lodgings in Wild-Court . I went to a House in that Neighbourhood , and sent for her and told her she had robb 'd me ; she said yes , and so she had . I desired to see her Box , she open 'd it , and the first Thing I saw was a Handkerchief of mine which I claim 'd . Yes , says she , that is yours , and a great many more Things which you little think of . Some of the Things were my own , and the rest had been Pledged to me . There was in particular a little Doll 's Gold-Ring . I asked her if she did not take a Moidore out of my Breeches as they hung up ; she said no , but she tookout a Guinea - I lost in all to the value of 12 l. or 14 l. She said she took the Goods at several times at the Ware-house Door . My Ware-house is up Stairs on the same Floor with the Nursery . When a Customer comes to redeem any Thing , 't is common for us to take the Bag in which are several sorts of Goods , and empty at the Ware-house Door to look for what we want , and when we have found it , we carry it down , and leave the rest of the Things there till we come up again ; and the Prisoner took these Opportunities to steal the Goods . Thomas Par . I went with my Son John to take the Prisoner up . She own 'd that the Handkerchief was his , and many more Things in the Box , and that she took the Guinea out of his Pocket . This was confirm 'd by the Mistress of the Rose-Alehouse , the Corner of Wild Passage where the Prisoner was examin 'd . She call 'd several Witnesses to her Character . They depos 'd they had known her some Years ; that she bore an honest Character , and always behav 'd her self well . The Jury found her Guilty . 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5.

Mr. Lucan . The Prisoner had been my Servant about three Weeks , but some Things being missing I suspected him , and turn 'd him away on the 8th of September . He came to me on the 24th of September for a Character ; I told him I would give him none . He went away , and threaten 'd to be revenged on me . Between eight and nine the next Evening , I being at the Castle Tavern in Lombard-street , word was brought me that my House in Red-lion Street in Clerkenwell was broke open . I took Coach directly , and when I came home I found my 'Scritore had been forced open , and the Goods taken away . I went into my Garden , and close to the Back door I saw the Mark of two Feet , which look 'd as if some Man had dropt from the Garden Wall . Near the Stable Door I found other Footsteps , and there lay a green Purse with some Gold in it , which I suppose had been dropt in the hurry . The Bar of the Stable Window was forced out , and the Glass was broke , by which I supposed the Rogue made his way out ; and one thing that made me suspect the Prisoner , was , that I found his Cane in the Stable Window . The Cane was remarkable , because it had an Iron Thimble upon it instead of a Ferril . I went back by the same Coach to my Friends at the Castle Tavern , to consult with them what Method I had best to take for discovering the Thief , and they advised me to put an Advertisement in the Daily Post . But about Two a Clock in the Morning I was knocked up , and told that the Prisoner was taken . Isabel Hornby , the Prosecutor 's Servant . About seven in the Evening I went out on an Errand , and there being Nobody else in the House , I left a Candle on the Stairs to light myself in . The Back Door was on the Latch , and I locked the Street Door and took the Key with me . I was gone about a quarter of an Hour , and then Thomas Brooks , a Foot-boy ( but he was not my Master 's Servant ) came home with me . When I opened the Door all was dark , and I could not find my Candle . Lord , says I to Brooks , Call your Nanny , for our John has been here - I suspected him , because he had done some ugly Tricks while he lived in my Master 's Service . I mist a Gold Watch out of my Master 's Chamber , and a Draught on the Bank for 137 l. besides what was lost out of the 'Scritoire . I saw Marks of Feet under the Garden Wall , the Key of the Stable Door was taken away , and the Window was propt up with the Prisoner 's Cane . Thomas Brooks . I went home with the Maid . She mist the Candle , and felt for it on the Stairs , but could not find it . We went down Stairs into the Kitchen , and found the Back-door open . I called my Fellow-Servant , and he called the Watch . Robert Shorter , Constable . On the 25th of September , between Ten and Eleven at Night , one came and told me there was a Jobb in the Watch-house , for a Man was taken up for drawing a Hanger upon a Woman in Gray's-Inn-Lane . I went , and found the Prisoner in the Watch house . I saw several Things taken from him , as 3 Cornelian Seals set in silver , some Gold Lace , a Shagreen Case , a Brass Shoe-Snuff-Box , a little pair of Steel Tweezers , and a Tin Box of Gunpowder . - Other Things had been taken from him before I came , by the Order of my Beadle Tim . Micklewright . Timothy Micklewright . The Prisoner was brought into our Watch-house at Holborn-Bars , between ten and eleven at Night . One of the Watchmen said , that the Prisoner offered to stick him , and was very troublesome ; upon which I ordered him to be Hand-cuffed and searched - He had this Hanger in his Hand ; there is a Knife and Fork in the Handle of it - And in his Pockets were found a Gold Watch and Case , a Gold Chain and Hook , four Seals and a silver Snuff-Box with a Stone in the top - the Haft of a Knife with a Nail fastened in it , and turned up crooked , which . I suppose , was to pick Locks with ; a Pistol and a Tin Box . I asked him what was in that Tin Box ; and he said it was Havanna Snuff , but it proved to be Gunpowder . Robert Ingleton . One that keeps a Snuff Shop in Gray's-Inn-Lane came to the Watch-house , and desired Assistance , for he said a Man had drawn a Dagger upon his Wife , who was big with Child . I told him he had got help at home , for one of our Watchmen lodged in his House - But however , Bob Nichols , another Watchman , went to help 'em , and so they brought the Prisoner to the Watch-house , and there we searched him , and found these What d 'ye call 'em 's - your Trinkle-me-trankles - your Thingumee 's for Ladies , [ the Hook and Chain ] and a Gold Watch and four Seals . I asked him how he came by such things , and he said he dealt in 'em . Then there was a Tin Box , he said it was full of - some sort of Snuff - I ca n't think of the Name of it - but I said , I 'll swear Devil , that 's no Snuff , but Gun-powder . - Marsh . The Man at the Snuff-shop came to the Watch-house for a Constable , telling us , that a Man had frightened his Wife . The Constable was not yet come to the Watch-house , and so I went for him ; and when we came back the Prisoner was in the Watch-house , and was so unruly that they were forced to Hand-cuff him . Those Things were found upon him as the other Witnesses have sworn ; and about two in the Morning word was sent to the Prosecutor , that the Prisoner was taken . Humphry Harper , Watchman . I lodge at Mr. Forsithe 's , the Snuff Shop in Gray's-Inn-Lane ; I was called up about Ten a Clock to go to my Watch , and my Landlord charged me with the Prisoner - As we were carrying him along to the Watch-house , he pulled out a Knife , and went to cut my Hand ; but I being aware of it , he only scratch 'd me with it , and then dropt it ; upon which I gave him a knock over the Shins , and stooping down I took up the Knife . When we got him into the Watch-house we searched him , and found the Goods upon him , and a Box of Gunpowder , which he said was Devally Snuff . William Seymore . About Nine at Night as I was going by Mr. Forsithe 's Shop , an Acquaintance of mine ( James Francis ) called me in , and said there was a Man that had got a great many Valuables , which he believed he did not come honestly by . I went in and found the Prisoner , and happened to know him ; for about five Weeks before , I saw him at a Publick House , and then he said he was out of Place , and had but Three half-pence in the World ; and by what I saw now , I thought the Times were much mended with him , for he shewed me a Hanger mounted with silver , which he flourished o'er his Head , and then put it up again , and went backwards and called for a Quartern of Gin . Then he shewed us a Gold Watch and Seals , which he said were his own , and that he dealt for such Things to France and Spain . We begun to question him a little , upon which he appeared very much ruffled , asked us what Business we had with his Way of Dealing , and if we had a mind to have a slice of his Hanger ? We told him , no . But however he offered to draw in earnest , upon which we seized him . Then he endeavoured to pull out a Pistol . Mr. Francis told me there was no danger , for he had seen the Pistol a little before , and it was not charged . Now , says I to my Gentleman , you shall give an account how you came by these Things before we part with you . The Man of the House was sent for home . As soon as he came in he struck the Prisoner , and told him he had surprized his Wife . There was one Watchman in the House , and Mr. Forsithe went for another , then we carried the Prisoner to the Watch-house . James Francis . I was smoaking a Pipe in Mr. Forsithe 's Shop ; the Prisoner came in , and said to Mrs. Forsithe , Madam , Will you please to give me a Pinch of Snuff ? She said , Yes . Now , Madam , says he , what return shall I make you for this Favour ? She told him , she desired none . Then , says he , will you give me leave to walk into your Back Room , and drink a Dram . She said he was welcome , and so he went in and had a half-penny Dram . There he pulled out this Hanger , and some of these other Things . I had some suspicion of him because he did not make an Appearance to be the Owner of such Goods . He took out a Pistol , and was going to charge it , for he said he had 500 l. value about him , and was to go to Bloomsbury , and from thence to Kensington that Night , and therefore must provide for his own safety ; but I told him he had better load his Pistol somewhere else for fear of frightening the Woman of the Shop , and so he desisted . Mr. Seymour coming to the Door , I called him aside , and told him what I suspected ; upon which he came in , and said , he had some Knowledge of the Fellow . The Prisoner shewed us all his Things , and would treat us with a Quartern . Seymour asked him who he deals with for those Goods . He answered , that he dealt Abroad with foreign Gentlemen . Why says I , those are English Goods . Upon this and some other Words he grew angry , and offered to draw his Hanger , asking us if we would have a slice of it . But we prevented him , and threw him into a Chain . Prisoner . I met a Man whom I had known beyond Sea , and he gave me these Things , and bid me go into the Snuff-shop , and stay till he came to me . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 6.

I got a Search-Warrant , and went to Mr. Johnson ( a Pawn-broker 's ) where I found 1 of my Shams , and 2 Rollers , and at Mr. Stone 's ( another Pawn broker 's ) I found 2 more of my Shams and a Stock . - Johnson . I had these of the Prisoner . - Stone . The Prisoner pledged these with me . Prisoner . We lodged in a Publick-house , and the Door of our Room was always left open , and so was his Trunk . Eleanor Whitfield . I lived then in Devereux Court . The Prosecutor left his Trunk locked fast ; and as for the Door of the Room being open , perhaps when a Friend has staid late at my House , I have got him to go up and lie with the Prisoner . I ca n't say but I had a very good Character of the Prisoner , or else I should not have taken him for a Lodger . On my leaving my House I removed the Trunk into another Room ; I thought it was very light ; but my Head was so full of my own Affairs , that I did not then enquire into the Reason of it . Three or four Witnesses appeared to the Prisoner 's Character . They deposed , that they known him several Years , that he was a Taylor by Trade , and they believed him to be honest .

The Surgeon came and dress 'd the Wound ; he said it was very bad , and that he must advise with another Surgeon in the Morning , and so he went away . And the Prisoner made some Sage-Tea for the Deceas 'd , and sat up with him all Night - He died about 5 a Clock on Sunday in the Afternoon . Mr. Marriot , the Surgeon . Between 1 and 2 on Sunday Morning , I was called to assist the Deceas 'd . The Prisoner said he had fell upon a Knife , and he did not contradict it . He had a dangerous Wound in the Abdomen , about 5 Inches from the Navel , and rather below it . The Orifice was so large , that a Portion of the Caul hung out , and the Wound was very Deep . Some of the Intestines and large blood Vessels were cut , and he had lost a vast Quantity of Blood . Between 7 and 8 the same Morning I was call 'd again by the Prisoner , I desir 'd the Assistance of another Surgeon , who came and approv 'd of what I did . I visited the Deceas 'd again at 11 , at 2 and 4 in the Afternoon , and he died about 5 . Here is the Case-knife - 'T is round at the End , but something sharp tho ' not pointed ; and the Wound exactly answers it . Prisoner . I did not tell the Surgeon that the Deceas 'd fell on the Knife . Mr. Marriot . I asked how the Wound came , and was answer 'd that he fell upon the Knife . I will not be positive that you made the answer , but there was nobody present but you and Ann Loft , besides my self and the Prisoner , and it was either you or she that said so . Marmaduke Williams . I live in the same House , I am Mr. Pellit 's Book-keeper ; I was a Bed when the accident happen 'd , and heard nothing of it till 8 o'Clock on Sunday Morning , and then I heard her say her self that she did it , and that she flung the Knife at him . I ask 'd her for what reason ? And she answer 'd , because he call 'd me Whore , and I would do it again if he was to call me so again ; and if I had not done it , I should have done it another time . Mr. Kindleside the Apothecary was then present , and ask 'd her if the Deceas 'd had offered any rudeness to her , and she said , No - They were often quarrelling , and she was commonly the aggressor , for she was very Insolent . About 3 Weeks before this happen 'd , he was in the Yard , and did something that displeased her , upon which she went out to him : He gave way ; she follow 'd him : He ran up Stairs , and she after him ; but he shutting his Door upon her , she stood Scolding and calling him names for a quarter of an Hour , and then she came down and said , she would be reveng 'd on him , and do him a Mischief one time or another . Prisoner . Did I never tell you that he was rude ? Marmaduke Williams . No - Indeed I have heard you say that he took you by the Hand and offer 'd to kiss you , but nothing farther - Another time she threw an Oystershel at him , which cut him in the Head behind the Ear , and it bled pretty much . Mr. Kindleside . Between 8 and 9 on Sunday Morning one came and told me that he was afraid the Maid had kill 'd the Porter - I went up stairs with Mr. Williams , and found the Deceas 'd in Convulsions . I said to the Prisoner , You have kill 'd the Man , and how will you like to be hang 'd for it ? O says she , I do n't fear that , for I did it in a Passion . I desired Mr. Williams to take care that she did not escape while I went for a Constable , and indeed she attempted to get away twice ; but he forced her into a Chair - I ask 'd the Deceas 'd how it happen 'd . He own 'd he call 'd her Whore , but said he offer 'd no rudeness , and that she was a violent passionate Creature , and had often threatned to do his business ; and he believ 'd she had done it now . I ask 'd the Prisoner the same question , and she answer 'd , he aggravated me and call 'd me Whore , and if he was to do so again , I would do the same . I found the Knife ( that I suppose it was done with ) among the foul Knives . It was bloody like rust , up to the Shoulder - that is , to this rising part of the blade - I could not conceive how such a Case Knife that was not pointed , but round at the End , could be thrown so , as to pierce through a strong Coat and Waistcoat , and a Dowlas Shirt , and so far into the Body : Which made me ask the Deceas 'd about that particular . He said it was done so quick , that he knew not whether she threw it or struck him with it in her Hand - The Girl Ann Loft appear 'd to be in a fright , and very much concern 'd that she had come thither without the leave of her Friends ; and that she was the only Witness present when the Mischief was done . Lord ! says she , what shall I say ? - Say ? Replied the Prisoner , What would you say , but that I was in a Passion , and threw the Knife as him . Prisoner . Did Mr. Williams here me say so ? Mr. Williams . I do n't remember it . Prisoner . What did I say ? Mr. Williams . I heard her say she did it because he call 'd her Whore . But I was so confused that I could not take notice of every word that past . Prisoner . I own that I threw the Knife . John Guy . Mr. Marriot and Mr. Kindleside came to my House between 9 and 10 in the Morning , and desired me to go into St. Martin's-lane to take up a Woman that had stabb 'd a Man . When I came there , I ask 'd the Deceas 'd how it happen 'd . He said there were very provoking words on both sides . I ask 'd him if she threw the Knife or stabb 'd him with it . He said he could not tell which . I enquired if he thought there was any premeditated Malice . He answer 'd that they had Quarrell 'd ; and she had threaten 'd to do his Business - We found the Knife , and it was 5 Inches from the point Red , and as it were rusty with the Blood . Court . Did it look as if it had gone so deep , or that the Blood had only run down so far towards the Handle John Guy . There were streaks of Blood upon it , as if it had so far been cover 'd with Blood ; and afterwards drawn through a Woollen Cloth , which might be done by pulling it back through his Waistcoat and Coat . Court . Was any part of the Blade cover 'd with Blood , or was it all streak 'd in that manner ? Guy . There was no one part intirely Bloody , but it was all streaky except within , about an Inch of the Handle , and there it was not Bloody at all . I took a wet Cloth and rubb 'd off some of the Red streaks next to the pin , and then that part appear 'd bright , by which I found that though the Red look 'd like rust , yet it was not rust but Blood - When the Prisoner heard that the Deceas 'd was Dead , she fell into violent Fits , which held her off and on for 5 or 6 Hours . Mary Walker . The Prisoner came to my House between 7 and 8 on Sunday Morning , I was then coming downStairs ; she ask 'd where she should find a Surgeon ; my Husband ask 'd her what was the matter and why she did not call her Master 's Surgeon ; she said their Man had cut himself , and would bleed to Death . I directed her to Mr. Lewis in Abchurch-lane ; she went away , and I soon after follow 'd her to her Master 's House , and finding her very much confused , I said , I hope you did not do this , she answer 'd ; I did it sure enough , but he says he wo n't tell : And I shall have the Surgeon to pay . I went up Stairs and found the Deceas 'd half in Bed . I ask 'd him how he did , he said , never worse . Somebody knock 'd at the Door . A Gentleman ( I suppose it was the Surgeon ) came up in his Cap , and ask 'd the Deceas 'd why he did not keep in Bed : By which I guest that the Gentleman had been there before . Then she went for her Master 's Surgeon , and I call 'd up Mr. Williams . I ask 'd the Deceas 'd my self how the Misfortune came , but he did not tell me . Samuel Ward . The Deceas 'd was my Relation . About 11 in the Morning , as I was going with my Master to Church , a Messenger came and told me that my Kins-man was dying . I was surpriz 'd at it , because I had seen him the day before , and he was then very well . As soon as my Master was gone into Church , I went to see my Kinsman , and found the Surgeons in the Room . How in the name of God , says I , did you come by this Misfortune ? Do n't ask me questions , says he ; some words happen 'd between us . But tell me , says I , was you doing any thing to her ? Did you offer to catch her by the Belly . No , says he . Why then how was it done ? says I . Uncle , says he again , I ca n't speak . Court , to Ann Loft . How far was the Prisoner from the Deceas 'd when he threw the Knife ? Ann Loft . About 3 Yards - The Prisoner was sitting on one side of the Table , and I on the other , and the Deceas 'd was behind me . Court . Did she rise from the Table with the Knife in her Hand ? Ann Lost . No . She did not rise up at all , for she was cutting Bread and Butter , and so was I too . Court . Did not she strike him with the Knife in her Hand ? Ann Lost . No - She threw it at him . Prisoner . I threw it out of my Hand , but did not know which way it went . I had no design to do the Deceas 'd a Mischief , for I ow 'd him no ill-will . John Braham . She was often a Quarrelling - One time as I came into the Kitchen with some Meat from my Master 's Table , she pitch 'd a Knife after me . Then the Prisoner call 'd Witnesses to her Character . Margaret Bell . I have known her from a Child , and never knew her in a Passion . Thomas Wood . She was my Servant a Year , and a good Servant she was , and I never did see her in a Passion , and my Wife will say the same . Deborah Lockley . I have known her several Years , she was always a very sober Person ; and I never heard any thing of her , tending to Passion . She lived with a Relation of mine , who has often told me , that she ( the Prisoner ) exprest a great deal of Tenderness and good Nature . Mary Bray . I have known her 23 Years , and never heard that she was inclin 'd to Passion , but was a sober quiet young Woman . Mary Kingston . A Virtuous modest Girl , and not given to drinking or ill Language . Thomas Durant . Of a very orderly Behaviour . Hester Gardner . Just , honest , and dutiful to her Parents . Deborah Johnson . She kept her Mother and 2 Sisters from starving . Sarah Willis . And impoverish 'd herself by her kindness to her Friends - I have known her 12 Years , she behav 'd well ; and was of so good a Temper , that I never saw her in a Passion . Ann Loft , again . I have been acquainted with her 2 Years . She liv 'd in the House where I liv 'd ; and she was very quiet and good Natur 'd , and not given to Passion . Court . If one Person kills another without a just provocation , it is Murder : And words alone are not a just provocation . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of the Indictment . Death . 17.

When I went out in the Morning , on the 12th of September , I left 7 Guineas in my Trunk , which stood in the Cellar Window , and my Wife had half a Guinea in her Pocket . Sarah Ansell . I sat at my Cellar Window to sell my Goods , and the Prisoner came and sat down by me as he us 'd to do . I gave him a Basket , and desir 'd him to step down , and fetch me up some Walnuts , I being busy with a Customer He staying much longer than was necessary , I call 'd him , and he said he was coming , and so he came up , with about half a hundred of Walnuts , tho ' he might have brought half a Bushell in less time . Presently after I had taken them from him , he held up his Hand , as if somebody had call 'd him , but no Body did , as far as I could hear ; and so he went away . In about ten Minutes afterwards , I had occasion to change a Guinea , and so went to my Trunk , and miss 'd all my Money ; which was kept Guineas and a Half , for I had put a half Guinea in , but a Quarter of an Hour before the Prisoner came ; and from that time , to the time I miss 'd the Money , no Body went down the Cellar but he .

The SPECIFICK INJECTION or LOTION , Which in Nineteen Years private Practice has cured 673 Gonorrheas or Claps , ( without taking any Medicine by the Mouth ) and has kept several Hundreds from Clap or Pox , which is sufficient to convince the World of its Efficacy . IT intirely destroys and carries off all Venereal Contagion , ( because it reaches the Cause immediately , which no Medicine taken by the Mouth can do , being liable as well as Food to the Alterations made upon them by the Stomach ) thereby prevents all the dismal Attendants of impure Embraces , as Inflammation , Scalding of Urine , Cordee , Phymosis , Paraphymosis , Herniaveneris , or swell 'd schirrbous Testicles , Buboes , Gleets , Shankers , dribling of Semen at Stool or Urine , in short , any kind of the Pox . Besides , it saves a Constitution which is too often tore to pieces by harsh Drugs , ill applied by ignorant Dabblers in Sin , Mercury , and Antimony , and spares the nauseous Trouble of swallowing such poisonous Slops , and the Confinement those rugged Drugs require ; and never fails acting with Safety , Secrecy and Ease , upon Man or Woman , without Confinement or Alteration of Diet . It cures old Claps , Shankers , nay if you piss thro ' a Dozen Holes , ( old Gleets , careous Ulcers in the Uraethra or Prostatiae , and all manner of Weakness from Nocturnal or Self-pollution , and Whites in Women , when every thing else is left off . ) I have been long of Dr. Cockburn 's Opinion , not to make publick any thing of this Nature ; but I see People as bold in Iniquity as ever , notwithstanding the bad Consequents of it ; and really the common Methods of Cure are none of the least Punishments attending it ; witness the vast Numbers of fine Youth , both Male and Female , daily ruin 'd , nay rotten before ripe , who seldom or never recover the Injury , which is oftner their Doctor 's Fault than the Distemper 's , which will run longer without hurting the Body , than when stopt by violent or frequent Purging Pills , Bolusses , Electuaries , Balsamick Elixirs , and lastly , Astringents , and what not . Simple Colds breed many Diseases , and simple-Claps , as they are generally managed , I affirm , lays not only a Foundation for the Pox , but Gout , Gravel , Leprosy , Rheumatism , King 's Evil and Scurvy , whatever People think to the contrary : Therefore I can no longer prevail with my self to with-hold so useful a Remedy from my fellow Creatures , who are daily imposed upon , both in publick Prints and private Practice , by People who generally know no more of a human Body , or the Operation of Medicine , than the Patient does , but uses such or such a Thing , because their Master did , or such a Man or such a Book taught them ; and how generally so unconscionable are as not to be satisfied with killing Men by a longed winded Cure , & c. but must entail Misery upon Posterity , rather than lose their unjust Gain .

People who want Help , or are tired out with the Pox and Apothecaries Slops , may do the same . N.B . I cure without Mercury , Antimony or Salivation : One Bottle of this will prevent many Claps , and generally cures a common one . It will keep many Years in any Climate . Ask for a Bottle of Wash , which is wrap 'd and seal 'd up . This never would have been made publick in this manner , could I have rendered it so extensively useful for Mankind without publishing .
