Mr. Setcole . The Prisoner at the Bar came into my Shop , in West-Smithfield , the 8th of June , between the Hours of five and six , and she pretended to buy some Holland ; her Behaviour during the Time she was in the Shop , gave me a Suspicion of her ; when she went out , one of my Servants was ordered to go after her , but Mr Walker being in the Shop , offered his Service and followed her ; while she was gone , I searched whether I had lost any thing , and missed a Piece of washed Dowlas , and in less than about 10 Minutes , Mr. Walker brought her back with the Cloth under her Arm ; she came running into the Shop with the Cloth , and threw it down where she had been sitting . She was carried before Sir Robert Godsehall , she owned the Fact privately to us before , but did not own it before Sir Robert Godschall . - She said it was the first Fact she had committed . Q . Did your Servant show her the Cloth or yourself ? Mr Setcole . My Servant . She had agreed for three Ells of it , and paid one Shilling in part . James Walker . I was in Mr Setcole 's Shop the 8th of June , and saw the Prisoner at the Bar , bargaining with Mr Setcole 's Servant for some cloth ; as soon as she went out of the Shop , Mr Setcole said he was afraid she had taken some Cloth ; he talked of sending a Servant to follow her , and I said I would follow her myself , which I did , and at the End of a Court , there was a Door , at which she went in and shut the Door ; I immediately opened the Door , and saw her Petticoats up , and the cloth then coming from under them . I took hold of her , and told her , Madam , - I called her Madam , because she was dressed in a fine damask Gown , and fine Cloaths . - Madam , said I , you must go with me to Mr Setcole 's the Draper , from whence you came ; she immediately took the Cloth and put it under her Arm , and came along with me ; coming thro ' the Cloysters , she fell down upon one Knee and dropped the Cloth , I suppose with Design of leaving it , but she took it up and brought it with her , then I saw her go into Mr Setcole 's Shop , she gave a little sort of a run , slipp 'd into the Chair , threw the Cloth down , and threw another Piece of Cloth which was upon the Counter , upon the Piece which she brought in with her , and had thrown down before ; immediately I took up that Piece of Cloth which she had under her Arm , and brought in and threw upon the Ground , and asked Mr Setcole , is that your Cloth ? for that was the Cloth which that Woman took from under her Petticoats and brought under her Arm . Q . Did you make a Mark upon it ? Walker . I did not . Setcole . This is my Cloth . Q . Have you any Mark by which you know that to be your Property . - Setcole . Yes ! the Mark is upon it now . - This is the Mark . Walker .

Q . Did you make her any Promise of Favour ? Walker . No : Q . Did you , Mr Setcole ? Mr Setcole . No . I told her I would do her Justice . James Mabbs . On the 8th of June , the Prisoner at the Bar came to Mr Setcole 's Shop , under pretence of buying some Holland . I shewed her several Pieces , whereof we agreed for one : at the Time we were agreeing , I observed that she had something under her Coat , sometimes shuffling , as if she had something she was afraid should drop , by which I immediately imagined she had robbed us of a Piece of Cloth ; after we had agreed for the Holland , she desired me to cut off three Ells , which I did , and put it into a Paper for her , and she gave me a Shilling Earnest ; as soon as she was gone , we all agreed that she had taken something , and intended to send a Servant after her , but Mr Walker being in the Shop , he offered to go , and in ten Minutes Time she came back with the Piece under her Arm ; she sat down in a Chair in the Shop , and flung the Piece of Cloth down upon the Ground , and endeavoured to pull another Piece of Cloth off the Counter to smother it , that I should not know which it was : In the Time that she was gone , I missed a Piece of Cloth , and found that Piece which I took up to be the same Piece which I before had missed . - She desired my Master to forgive her , and offered to go down upon her Knees if he would let her go , but we are so much troubled with these Customers , he thought proper to do her Justice . William Ford , Constable , Mr Setcole came to my House and told me he had lost a Piece of Cloth , and that he had detected the Woman in the Fact , and desired me to come and take Charge of her ; she begged I would endeavour to make the Affair up , and she would send for Friends and make Satisfaction , that she had 5 Children and desired me to make it easy . The Prisoner , in her Defence , said she went into the Court to make Water . Walker . I saw no Water . - I saw her pull this Piece of Cloth from under her Coats . - She very willingly came along with me ; she was dressed in a very fine Manner . - I did not lead her along , for I was not afraid of her getting away . Q . Have you not several Pieces of Cloth with the same Mark ? - Setcole . Yes , but there were none such upon the Counter . Prisoner . I have a great Number of Witnesses to my Character .

On the 30th of June I had been making merry with my Friends , it was my Birth-Day , I was then 26 years of Age . As I was coming over Tower-Hill I met the Prisoner , she lodged in a House that I was Servant at , one Richard Dyer 's , She asked me to drink , I told her I had but three Half-pence and I would spend it with her , so we drank a Pint of Beer ; we met a middle sized Man , and he said to her Molly how do you do , and they began to talk very lovingly together , and I sat down at the Door of the Hamburgh Arms and drank a Pint of Beer ; I said I could not stay , she desired me to stay a little ; she went into her Lodging which was just by , and stay 'd better than a Quarter of an Hour , I was tired with waiting , so I goes up Stairs , and calls , Molly . Q . What Room did they go into ? Holder . They went into a Room two Pair of Stairs backwards . I went up Stairs and heard a very great Debate , as if he had lain with her , for she asked him for a Shilling ; I was then at the Door where they were . I came down again , In about 10 or 12 Minutes , or a Quarter of an Hour , I saw the Prisoner holding a Hat under his Chin to his Throat , and he bleeding into it , the Man was standing thus , the Head leaning a little forward . Q . What Sort of a Hat was it ? Holder . It seemed to be an old Hat . Q . Was it a Man 's Hat , or a Woman 's Hat ? Holder . A Man 's black Hat . With that I said to her , Molly , what are you about ? Molly , said I , how can you be so barbarous ? Q . What Reason had you to believe it was her Barbarity ? Rebecca Holder . At first I asked her , how she could be so barbarous as to let me stand so long at the Door when I have no Money in my Pocket ? And when I saw the Man bleeding , then I asked her , how she could be so barbarous to murder the Man ? She said , if I knew the old Rogue so well as she did , I would not call her barbarous ; but she desir 'd I would not take any Notice of it . She has never been at home since . I call 'd upon one Ann Hyam , in Grubstreet , and told her , I was very much shock 'd to see the Thing . Q . Was the Man alive when you saw him bleeding and under his Throat ? Rebecca Holder . I can not tell , I did not go in to see ; I run down Stairs very much surprized - I saw not the Man afterwards . The Prisoner 's Right-hand was bloody , her Apron and Neck-Handkerchief were both bloody - I never saw her after that Night . - I was last Monday before the Coroner . Prisoner . Why did you not make a Declaration of this sooner ? Rebecca Holder . Because I have heard , by all Accounts , she was a wicked , vile Creature , and I was afraid of my Life . Prisoner .

Which they did ; that they met a Man , and the Prisoner and the Man went up Stairs into her ( the Prisoner 's ) Lodgings , that she desired her to stay , and she would come again presently . That she went into a House on Tower-hill to drink a Pint of Beer , till she came down : She thought she staid a good while , so went up Stairs , and heard a great many Words pass , as if they had differed ; that some time after that , she looked into the Room , and saw a Man bleeding very plentifully at the Mouth and Nose . I advised her to go before a Justice and make a Discovery , but she did not go for some Days . Q . Do not you know who this Man was ? Ann Hyam . No : I never saw the Man in my Life . Elizabeth Portington . On the 30th of June , about 10 or 11 o'Clock at Night , the Prisoner came to my House , and asked , if she could lie there ; I told her , I could not accommodate her .

[ R. Holder called again . ] Court .

It was standing upright , in this manner ; [ leaning her Head a little forward ] by the Debate there was between them , I suppose he had lain with her , and that she wanted some Money of him , because she said , he was not so good as his Promise . Q . Where was you when you saw this ? Holder . I was at the Landing-place , just by the Door . - The Door was a-Jarr , not open , - There was no Bed in the Room ; there was something of Flocks or Feathers lying in an odd manner , and an old Waistcoat . Q . When you saw this Man thus bloody , did you hear any struggle between them ? Holder . No ; but she had called him old Rogue , and Son of a B - h. Q . Did not the Man cry out ? Holder . No . Prisoner . My Lord , these People have often been concerned in forging of Seamen 's Wills and Powers ; I had given an Information against 14 Persons , which was made before Justice De Veil ; I am the unhappy Widow of that Rhodes , who was executed on Monday , for being concern 'd in these Practices ; they have lodged this Indictment against me to take away my Life , to prevent my giving Informations . I have seen so much of the Wickedness of these Things , that I went and made a voluntary Confession ; for that Reason they seek my Life ; they have threaten 'd it several Times . William Wintx , Deputy to Mr King the Coroner . On the 3d of July , I went with my Inquisition to view this Body , in a House by Tower-Ditch ; up two Pair of Stairs in a Back-room , there was a Body lying with the Head almost cut off , a Hat full of conjealed Blood , and a Razor all bloody . - There was not one Spot of Blood on the Floor , which makes me conclude the Murder was not committed there . I got a Candle to examine the Floor though it was light enough ; but I was willing to be thoroughly satisfied : The Head lay upon a Heap of Rubbish , I turned the Head aside , to see if there was any Blood under it , and moved the Rubbish with my Foot , but there was none , which must have been if he had been murder 'd there ; they likewise viewed every Room in the House , and could find no Blood in any of them . - I do not think that the Man was murdered in that House , for there must be more Blood come out of a Body than the Quantity that was in the Hat ; and the Room did not appear to have been washed lately . Coroner . The Man that was murdered sold Sticks upon Tower-hill , his Name was John Husday , - he used to lodge sometimes in one House , and sometimes in another , at 2 d. a Night . Prisoner . I had made an Information about 12 Months ago about forging of Wills , and there are many that do these Things to wrong Widows and Children ; but if it please God I live to come out , I will make a Discovery of all that I know . [ Holder call 'd again . ] Court . Consider what it is to swear against a Woman when her Life is at stake , why did not you go and give an Information of this ? Holder . I was afraid of this Mary Terry , - but I did discover it afterwards . I am a poor working , honest Woman , and can bring People to my Character . Court . It is an unreasonable Thing to suppose , that you should see a Man standing up , and bleeding into a Hat , with his Throat cut , and not cry out murder , and give an account of it directly .

I met with a Gentleman in Holbourn , whom I enquired of , and he said , he did not know any such Person , unless it was over the Way . I went up Shoe-lane , and enquired if any such Person lived there , I enquired of this Woman , she stood at a Door , and said , she lodged there up one Pair of Stairs ; so I went into the House ; as soon as I got into the House with the Bundle , she shut the Door , and took the Bundle from me , in the Entry , and carried it up Stairs ; I went up Stairs after her , to see the Bundle safe delivered to the Person who was to have it ; as soon as I got into the Room , where she told me the Gentlewoman lodged , she threw me down upon the Red , and then searched my Pockets , and took out two Silver Knee-Buckles , one Silver Stock-Buckle , and 14 d. in Money , and then she went to tearing the Paper the Linnen was wrapp 'd in ; I strove as long as I could to get the Linnen from her , which when I had done , I ran down Stairs and got away , and carried the Linnen to the Place where I had it from , Mr Peter Keysterman 's , a Hambro Merchant , in Lawrence Pountney-lane ; he was at my Mother 's the Day before , and desir 'd she would let me go with it . - He sent it by me , because he has no Servant of his own . - As soon as I got back again with the Linnen , I complained to him , and he got a Constable , and we went and took her up , in the same House where I was misused . - I believe it was a Fore-room , and no Shutters to the Windows . - I did not cry out , because I thought I could manage her . - There was no Woman in the Room but herself .

Why did he send them to the Compter ? White . Because he did not know but they might be aiding , or assisting , or have the other Buckle . Prisoner .

This is a persidious Case , when you know [ to the Constable ] what pasied between you and I in the Back-room ; the Boy came to the Door , and asked for a Dram , I thought such Boys had no occasion for Drams ; I said to him , prithee , Boy , go about your Business ; says one of the Women , let the Boy have a Dram , and so I did , and he gave me 2 d. for it , and the Boy went into the Back room with them about 11 o'Clock .

They were likewise indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest , for feloniously staying the said Thomas Cooke . After the Counsel had opened the Nature of the Cause , the Witnesses for the Prosecutor were called . Nathaniel Root . Cooke the deceased , and I , were at work together , in Mourning-Lane , in Hackney Parish : This Mr Clark , and this Mr Price , came riding along the Road by us full speed , and they had like to have rode over Cooke ; he told them they ought to be knocked off their Horses for riding so fast . Clark comes up to Cooke first , and dismounted , upon that Cooke held his Spade against Mr Clark , over his own Head , and Clark had the Butt End of his Whip over Cooke 's Head . - Cooke held his Spade up in his own Defence . Q . Which was up first , the Whip or the Space ? Root . I can not say whether the Spade was held up before Clark had his Whip up . - I can not say which was up first . Upon that this Mr Price came up , and I catched him by the Arm , and bid him go about his Business , - he made no Answer whether he would or no , but after a few Words more , they both went away . - 2 . What Time of the Day was it ? - Root . It was between two or three o'Clock in the Afternoon , I did not see them afterwards . Q . Were not you working in a Ditch ? Root . No . It is level Ground , there is no Ditch at all , we were making up the Bank . Cooke was a little frightned , and if they had not turned back again , there would have been no Harm done : He did not call after them , he spoke as they were riding by . - I think , as near as I can say , the Horses were just over-against him . - There was never a Blow struck on either Side , as I saw . Daniel Ferguson . This was by Mr Rudge 's Brew-House in Hackney-Parish . On the 15th of April , I was coming along Mourning-Lane , I had a Load of Soot upon my Back . The Prisoners came riding along very hard , - they rode a full Gallop ; my Fellow-Apprentice was before me , and bid me get out of the Way ; and if I had not I should have been rode over . So I threw myself against the Bank . Mr Clark 's Horse came pretty near the Bank , then Cooke said , you ought to be knocked off your Horses for riding so hard : Whereupon Clark , he , the tall one , lifted up his Whip against Cooke . I was about thirty Yards off , and saw Cooke lift , up his Spade , so , which was up first , the Whip or the Spade , I can not say : I saw no Blows pass , nor any thing after this , for I was in the Shed , shooting my Soot out of my Sack . Root called again . What Day of the Month was this ? Root . It was the 15th Day of April . John Flatman . I saw the Prisoners at the Bar in Mourning-Lane , the 15th of April last . I was going Home after my Boys , this and another ; these two Gentlemen were riding at a great Rate , and passed by me : I could not see quite up the Lane , for there is a winding in the Lane , and then they were out of my Sight till I came up to the turn of the Lane , then I saw Mr Clarke and Mr Cooke have hold of each other by the Collar , - it was between two and three o'Clock in the Afternoon , Clark dismounted , and held up his Whip with the butt End upwards against Cooke . - I do not know whether he held the Whip up against Cooke with a Design to strike him . - I stepped up , and said , do not be afraid of the Man that has got hold of you , for the other shall not meddle with you . Mr Price came and laid hold of me by the Collar , I asked him what he laid hold of me for : he said , because you should not hurt my Friend , I said I am not going to hurt you , nor your Friend neither ; let me go or I will give you a knock on the Face , then they soon mounted their Horses and away they went . Q . Did you see them afterwards on that Day ? Flatman . Yes . I saw them about four Hours afterwards in Mourning-Lane . I live just by the Place where this happened . People had done Work . They passed by , came back and rode into my Yard , I was smoaking a Pipe over the Pales ; they asked me for a Pot of Beer , I answered them I sold none ; is there no Publick House near , says they , let us drink together ; thinks I , if I do not go , they will think I am afraid of them , and so I went with them to the Plough Alehouse at Hammerton ; when I came to the Alehouse , Mr Clark , I think it was , called for a Pot of Beer , and there was a full Pot of Beer brought , then , while the Beer was fetching , Mr Price would have quarrelled with me , I told him I did not care for fighting . Mr Clark brought the Beer to me , and I drank out of the Pot . Mr Clark asked me which was the House Cooke lived at ; one Man pointed at the House , and said , that is the House . Mr Clark said he would go and see for him , and he did go , I did not go with Mr Clark . - Cooke lives about sixty Yards from the Plough ; he was not at Home , and Clarke said , if he had been within , and would not have come along with him , he would have whipped him before him . - A little after , - as soon as the Words were well out of his Mouth , he saw Cooke coming towards his own House . Says one , there is Cooke coming along . Clark hailed him , and Cooke made a short stand , then he beckoned him , and Cooke came up to the Plough Door . Says Clark , Now if you are a Man fight me . Cooke said , I will not fight , I am not obliged to fight every Fellow , or Words to that Effect , and he would not fight : Then both the Prisoners said , if he would not fight they would Horse-whip him . Said Cooke , you may use your Pleasure , but you had better let it alone than horse-whip me . Then Mr Price went and talked to him , what the Words were , I can not tell , but they were spoke in an angry Way . Mr Price laid hold of his Arm in order to get him into the House to fight . Cooke had pitched his Load , and sat down at the Door with a Pipe in his Mouth . Price took the butt End of his Whip , and broke the Pipe in Cooke 's Mouth , and the Piece which Cooke had in his Hand , which was the Bowl End , he took and irted at Price , but I do not know whether it hit him . Price then fell upon Cooke , and flung him over or cross the Rail , with the blows that he gave him , and fell upon him and beat him ; there were several Blows about the Face , for his Face was as bloody as a Slaughter-House . - You could not see his Face for Blood . - Clark was by , but Clark did not meddle with him . - Q . Did you see Clark lay hold of the deceased ? Flatman . I did not . Then Cooke went away and went Home . - I saw Cooke come by my Door three or four Times afterwards . - I saw him two or three Days after this Quarrel , and he was in a miserable black Condition . - Q . Did he make any Complaints ? Flatman . He said he had got some inward and never should be his own Man again , and he said he believed the Man that beat him was the occasion of it - I believe he did not know his Name then . - I never spoke to him after that Time , but every Time I saw him , I thought he grew worse and worse . He could walk as upright as any Man before , but could not do so afterwards . Q . Did you ever hear that he complained of his Lungs . Flatman . No . He was pretty healthy , but he had not a ruddy Complexion . Q . When you saw this , why did not you take him off . Flatman . I have had too much of that already , but if I had done it , this Person , Mr Clark , would have fell upon me , and then we should have been all in a bad Condition . Q . Did this Transaction appear to you as any thing more than a common Quarrel ? Flatman . It did not appear as a common Quarrel to me , for Men to come three or four Hours afterwards , and kill another Man , I do not think that can be called a common Quarrel . Joseph Rollo . I knew Cooke very well , I saw him the Thursday before Easter , I can not remember the Day of the Month , ( on looking into an Almanack , it appeared to be the 15th of April ) . I saw Mr Clarke at the Plough at Hammerton , either on Horse-back or Mare-back , I can not tell which , I saw him go from the Plough to Cooke 's House , with his Whip in his Hand , and I saw him return again , and heard him say , he was not at Home ; and I believe in a Minute , or two Minutes afterwards , as Cooke was coming by the Marsh-Gate , in his Way Home , I saw Mr Clark beckon with his Hand to call him to come up , and then Mr Clark offered him five Shillings to box him , then there were Words arose between all three of them , then I saw Mr Price take the butt End of his Whip , and as Cooke was rising , upon the half Bend , knocked the Pipe out of Cooke 's Mouth , then he laid hold of him , overpowered him , and threw him upon the top of the Rail , - then he lay upon him , and beat him over the Face with his Hand . Q . Was it with his Hand or Fist , for there is some Difference between them . Rollo . With his Fist to be sure , for Men do not go to fight like Women with their Hands open . - Clark did not do any thing . - Cooke was afterwards in a drooping , wasting Condition . I do not know that he did any Work after this ; it was a dismal Aspect to see him afterwards , for he grew worse and worse Day after Day , and Time after Time . - He was very well before , I do not know that in two Years that I have known him , he has had a Day 's Illness . Q . Do you know the Occasion of his Illness afterwards ? Rollo . No ; I can not tell the Occasion of a Man 's Disorder , for I am not a Surgeon . I have often asked him how he did ? he said , he was worse and worse , and that he was sadly used . Q . How came you not to part them , when you saw him so abused ? Rollo . It cost me once , at Hick's-Hall 10 l. for parting a Man and his Wife , and I did not care to part two Men . - Green . I knew Thomas Cooke . I saw him and the Prisoners at the Bar , the Thursday before Easter , at the Plough Door , they were enquiring ( I ca n't tell which of them it was ) where Cook lived , Mr Clark went and enquired if he was at home , and they said he was not ; then Clark said , if he had been at home , and would not have come , he would have whipp 'd him all the way up to the House . In a very little while afterwards , Cooke was going homeward , and Clark called to him , and he came ; and I believe Clark said , was you not a Rogue to serve me as you did , to threaten to knock me me off my Horse , and then to go to strike me with your Shovel ? said Cooke , My Partner said , if he had been in my Place he would have knock 'd you off the Horse . I believe Cooke sat down , and Price insisted on his going into a Room to fight him ; I believe he took him by the Collar , and said , he would either swear the Peace against him , or he should fight him ; Cooke said , he might do as he pleased , for he would not fight : The little Gentleman , Price , up with his Whip , and made an offer to hit Thomas Cooke , but he did not . Then , presently , he broke Cooke 's Pipe , which was in his Mouth , with his Whip , Cooke tossed the other Piece at him ; with that Price fell a beating him . - He was very much beat , and very bloody . The next Morning he looked very bad , and said , he was sadly hurt ; but he could not tell who it was that beat him . - I saw him about three Weeks before he died ; then he was very bad . - He was very well before that beating . Samuel Pamplin . I saw some Persons at the Plough Door , - it was the 15th of April ; I heard Mr Price , say to Cooke , Will you fight me ? says he , Gentlemen , I do not want to fight with you , if I should be hurt , how shall I maintain my Family ? Sirrah , says he , I will give you a Crown , or half a Crown , or a Crown Bowl of Punch to fight me ; but he would not : With that , this Mr Price walked up and down , and now and then took the Man by the Collar , and shook him , as he was smoaking ; that he came up to him and said , you old Rogue will you fight , and then with a sort of a slanting Stroke , he hit the Pipe out of his Mouth , with his Whip ; and Cooke tossed the Bit of the Pipe that was left in his Hand at him , with that Price closed in upon him , and after a short Scuffle , threw him down cross the Plate of the Sign-post , and there he held him , that the Man could not turn his Body one way or another ; he gave him several Blows about his Breast and Arms , and held him by the Handkerchief , which he had about his Neck . - I saw a little Blood come out of his Mouth , but that might be caused by the Pipe ; then they mounted their Horses and went away , Cooke walked away as well as he could ; but he walk 'd but sadly . He went to get an Officer to take them up . When I saw him afterwards , he always looked sadly . He said , he was very bad , and should never be his right Man again . - Before that he appear 'd to be in good Health . - He was always a Pale looking Man . - I believe he never did a Day 's Work afterwards . - I said , it is a sad Thing that so many People should be standing by , and not take him off , but let the Man be murdered . Sirrah , says Clark , if you do any thing , I will give you as much ; let them have it out . The Man at the Plough , I think , parted them . Jane Chambers . I was at the Plough Door , Mr Clark and Mr Price came up , and called for a Tankard of Beer , Cooke came up , with his Pipe in his Mouth , and Clark jangled with him , and called him Rogue , and asked him to fight . This little Man struck Cooke , and slung him cross the Sign Post ; he dropp 'd his Whip , and took hold of his Handkerchief so , and beat him till the Blood came wretchedly ; he laid with his Back cross the Sign Post . I came and laid hold of Price by the Waist-band of his Breeches , to pull him off , and Clark got up his Whip , and said , You old Bitch , I 'll knock your Brains out , if you do not begone . I said , that is more than you dare do . - My Master at the Plough came out and unclosed them ; Cooke said after this , he believed he had given him his Death , and should never be his own Man again . Mary Wells . The 15th of April I was looking out of Window , and Mr Clark stopped to water his Horse , Mr Price rode on a little faster ; then Price turned back again , and said to Mr Clark come along Johnny , for I have done his Business , or I have done it for him . Clark said , do not ride so fast , for I am not afraid of him . He was very much bruised . He appeared to be in a good State of Health before , but declined ever afterwards . I have known him 11 Years all but one Month . Sarah Cooke , the Widow of the Deceased . What I have to say , is with to respect Clark , I never saw Price till Yesterday . The 15th of April Clark comes and asks , if this was Cooke 's House ? Yes , Sir , said I , what would you please to have with him ? he said , I want to speak with him , tell him my Name is Clark , and send him to the Plough , to drink a Pot of Beer with me ; about two or three Minutes , after Clark was at my House , my Husband was coming along , all in his Blood ; when he came home , he was in a very bad Condition ; he said , the worst of all was his Back ; he said , he has hurt my Back so , I am afraid I shall never recover it ; my Face may be well again , I do not mind that ; he grew worse ever after , and by way of Complaint , has often said , This Man has been the Death of me . He said , the little Man has done my Business ; Clark never hit him . John Dunckley . He was in a good State of Health before this . He has often told me , he believed he should never get over it . Samuel Summer confirm 'd good part of the preceding Evidence . On the 15th of April I saw there was a little Man just rode by , and I think I met that tall Gentleman on Horseback ; he said , you old Rogue , you have it now , remember the Spade in the Lane . I saw Cooke the next Day , and his Face was almost as black as my Hat . I think , before this , he was in a good State of Health . About three Weeks after this Accident , I saw him drooping very much ; I asked him , where his Complaint was ? he said , in my Stomach , and the Small of my Back : Said I , do you think it came by the Quarrel ? Yes , said he , I believe it did , and nothing else . Mr Norris sworn . This Deposition was taken by me . I knew the Deceas 'd very well , it was read before him in my Presence , and I signed it ; I gave him a great Caution to take care of what he said , that he was going to appear before God Almighty , and he must be exceeding careful of what he said in his Deposition ; he said , he would say nothing but what was true , he died in eight or nine Days . [ The Deposition read to the following Effect . ] Dated the 30th of May , signed Thomas Cooke , his Mark . Midd Thomas Cooke , of the Parish of St. John Hackney , in the County of Middlesex , Labourer , maketh Oath , That on the 15th of April , as he was working with one Root , in Mourning-lane , two Persons , ( one he was was informed , keeps a Livery-Stable , near the City of London ) rode by very hard , he spoke to them , and one of them said , he would lick him , upon which he held up his Spade to keep him off , but did not touch him with it . In two or three Hours they returned again , and hearing that two Persons wanted to speak with him , at the House of Richard Herbert , he went there , and that Clark said , Damn you , you old Rogue , you shall fight me . The other Person , who to the Deponent is unknown , broke his Pipe and beat and bruised him in a very dangerous Manner ; that he is now in a low and weak Condition , and verily believes , that this beating and bruising was the Occasion of his Death . Mr Fisher , Apothecary . Cooke came to my Shop , I do not remember the Time , it was in April , or May . I saw him pretty near his Death , he opened his Waistcoat , and I could not see any Marks of Violence upon his Breast or Back . I saw him about 10 Days before he died , he spit soetid , corrupted Matter , and was in an emaciated Condition ; - I choose to leave it to the Surgeons to account for his Disorder . Mr Girle , Surgeon . Upon opening the Body there was an Adhesion of the Lungs on the Right-side , and there was corrupted Matter on the Lungs . I can not tell what was the Occasion of his Death . - A Man may live a great while under such Habit of Body ; but such an Accident may hasten his Death . They have Pains , and Coughs in the Beginning of all Adhesions . A violent Blow may affect the Lungs . I can not say how long this Adhesion may be coming in a natural way , it may come suddenly upon a violent Inflammation ; and supposing this Adhesion to be an old Disorder , this Usage might hasten his Death . Mr Nourse , Surgeon . I was desired to be at the opening of the Body , I saw no Marks of Violence on the Outside , in the Inside I found a Quantity of Matter in the Thorax , and the Lungs had contracted a Quantity of Matter , and there was a general Adhesion of the Lungs , which in diseased Bodies are very common . This Adhesion was , I believe , before this Scuffle , for if this Inflammation had been so great , as to occasion this Adhesion , his Complaint would have been much worse when the Inflammation was so violent , than afterwards ; and his Complaint was not so great at first as afterwards ; I believe that this Violence might hasten his Death . On the Right-side there was a Quantity of Matter , of a reddish Hue , I took more particular Notice of the Colour of the Matter , because I designed to make an Experiment . When I asked the Apothecary , whether he thought he had ever spit Blood ? he said , He believed he had . I asked him , Whether he was so curious , as to examine into the Matter , he called Blood ? he said , He had not made Enquiry enough to satisfy himself . I do not think he spit any Blood at all ; this Matter which is of a reddish Hue , is so much like Blood , that a Person may be deceived , and take it for Blood . I made an Inspection into all the other Bowels , and found them as they usually are , except the Liver , which had some Appearance of a Decay ; which must have been coming some Time before . - Such a Blow as would have occasioned an Inflammation , must have been visible at first . Mr Polock , Surgeon . I examined this Body , I saw him about three or four Days before his Death , he complained of a Purging , there was no Appearance of any Violence , but there was an Inflammation in his Bowels . Q . Is that a Distemper that People have naturally without any external Blow ? Polock . Yes , undoubtedly . If it was occasioned by a Blow , it must make a visible Appearance . - I was sent thither by Mr Clark ; he said he did not know that he was hit in any other Place but the Face . He complained of being thrown over a Rail . He said he was not struck on the Breast , but only complained of a Soreness in his Back . - He did not say to me , that it was the Occasion of his Death , or that he should not be his own Man again . Q . You have heard how this Man was used . Might not this occasion his Death ? Polock . I can not say that it would . Q . But might not this hasten his Death ? Polock . I can not say but it might . Joseph Sumpter . I saw Cooke riding in the Marsh in May , when they were going to gather Stones for Mr Rudge . Richard Herbert , Master of the Plough Alehouse . I saw Mr Clark and this Gentleman come into the Town , and ask where they could get a Pot of Beer , they called for a Pot of Beer , and my Servant got it for them ; they were sometimes in the House and sometimes at the Door . - The Gentlemen were talking about a Quarrel they had before ; I saw no Blows at all . Q . Who parted them ? Herbert . I parted them . This Gentleman , Mr Price , and Cooke , had hold of each other by the Collar , when I parted them . - I did not see any Motion of the Hand to strike . - He was upon the Rail , but not the Rail of the Sign-Post . Couns . You look upon this only as a common Quarrel , do n't you ? Herbert . It was only a Quarrel : They were a little drunkish . - It looked to me as if they had been quarrelling . Price was uppermost , he was bloody , and must have had a Blow . [ The Witnesses to the Prisoners Characters , called . ] James Waldon . I have known Price five or six Years .
