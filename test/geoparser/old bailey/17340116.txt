Elizabeth Bromfield . I keep a House in Bell-Yard in King's-street , Westminster , where I sell Greens and Fruit . I keep the Lower-part for my own Use , and lett all the Rest . This Woman robb 'd me of all that I had in the World , and did not leave me so much as an Apron or a Cap to put on . About 6 in the Morning , I lock 'd my Door , and took the Key in my Pocket , and went out to Covent-Garden-Market to buy some Apples , and returning , between 7 and 8 , my Door was broke open , and my Silk-gown , and Quilted-petticoat , and two Gold-rings , and 9 s. were gone , I expected ( suspected ) the Prisoner had done it , because about two Months before this , she had robb 'd me of a Flannel-petticoat , and 15 s. for which I had her sent to Bridewell for six Weeks . I could not find her again 'till about a Month ago , when she came to see Tho Tovey 's Wife , who lodges in my House , and Mr. Tovey stopt her . I tax 'd her with robbing me , and she confess 'd it , and told me , she had sold one of the Gold-rings to Mrs. Bennet , for 16 s. 10 d and the other to another Person for 18 s. Catherine Bennet . The Prisoner lay three Nights at my House , about four Months ago ; she had nothing to eat nor drink , and so she left a Serge-coat with me for Lodging , and Bread , and Small-beer ; and afterwards she told , she had left her Mother 's Wedding-ring in pawn for Half a Guinea , and Six-pence Use , and ask 'd me to buy it , and said I should have it as cheap as any Body . I told her , I would give as another , and so I carry 'd it to a Goldsmith , who weigh 'd it , and said it came to 16 s. and he would give no more ; whereof I gave her 16 s. 10 d. for it , and here it is . Prosecutrix . This is the Ring I lost . Prisoner . Did I pawn the Ring ? Bennet . You said your Husband pawn 'd it . Prisoner . Did I ever wrong you ? Bennet . No . Jane Taylor . I live in Bow-street - some call it Thieving-Lane , in Westminster . The Prisoner lay two Nights at my House , and pawn 'd this Quilted-Petticoat , with me for Victuals ; she said it was given her by her Sister on London-Bridge , and she never wrong 'd me . The Jury found her guilty to the Value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 2. Thomas Rowland , otherwise Rowlatt , of South-Mims , was indicted for stealing a Pillowbier , a Coat , 36 Yards of Check , 15 Yards of Ticking , 12 Portugal Pieces of Gold , value 45 l. 74 Guineas and a Half , 46 Spanish Pistoles , val . 37 l. 19 s. 3 Pieces of French Gold , val . 2 l. 17 s. 9 d. and 5 l. 19 s. and 6 d. in Silver , the Goods and Money of John East , Decem . 10 . Joseph Sherrard . I lodge at the White-Bear at Hadley , near Barnet ; the Prisoner came thither on Sunday , the 9th of December , about 9 in the Morning , he call 'd for a Pen and Ink , and went into a Room to tell some Money . He came out again , in a little Time , and told me and another , he could shew me such a Sight , as I never saw with my Eyes . He pull 'd out a Bag , and put twelve 3 l. 12 s. Pieces , and one Guinea into my Hand ; from another Bag he took out several other Outlandish Pieces of Gold , but did not tell the Number of them ; putting his Hand in his Pocket , he shew 'd me Parcel a of Guineas , I ca n't say how many there might be ; and then , opening a Paper , he produc 'd a Diamond-ring , and said , he believ 'd that was of more Value than all the rest ; he likewise pull 'd out a Purse of Gold , as he said it was , but he did not open it - and as for Silver I did not see any . He told me that his Master , who ( he said ) liv 'd at Nottingham , had sent him about the Country with Orders to receive this Money for Goods , but I thought it more likely that he had committed some Robbery , or Murder , and so I fetch 'd Assistance and apprehended him on suspicion , upon which he at first said he 'd make me pay for stopping him on his Journey - But afterwards he own 'd that he had robb 'd his Master East . John Dean , Constable . The Prisoner was examin 'd before Justice Smith . Court . Was his Examination taken in Writing ? Dean . I ca n't say as to that , but he made no Confession to me . John Buckle . Joseph Sherrard told my Father , and me , that he suspected the Prisoner , and wanted a Constable . I said any Man might take a Thief . My Father , Humphry Buckle , seiz 'd the Prisoner , and said he should go with us before the Justice . The Prisoner refused , and pulling out a Pocket-Book , said , Here 's my Orders from my Master in the Country . I did not see the Writing , for he made a Hand of it ; but I saw 48 Guineas , 12 Portugal Pieces of 3 l. 12 s. each , and some Doubloons , and double Doubloons , I think they call 'em . The Morning ( after he had been before the Justice ) as I lay by him on the Bed at the White-Bear , he confess 'd to me , that he had robb 'd his Master East of that Gold , and that he took it out of the Scratoir . Court . Did he say he had taken any thing else ? Buckle . Yes , I remember a Piece of White Dimity and some other Things . Court . Did he tell you where Mr. East lived ? Buckle . Yes , it was somewhere in London near the Monument ; but I forgot the Name of the Street . And he wrote this Letter to his Master , who thereupon came down that Monday Night . Court . Did you see him write the Letter ? Buckle . Yes , I sat close by him when he writ it . Court . Then it may be read in Evidence . Clerk .

Transportation . 3. Susan Brown , was indicted for stealing a Callimanco-Gown , two Tea-Spoons , a Silk-hood , and two Yards of Ticking , the Goods of John Saint , Dec. 19 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 4,5. Elizabeth Jones , and Elizabeth Clark , were indicted for privately stealing from the Person of Thomas Iverson , a Silver Watch , value 3 l. January 6 . Thomas Iverson . Last Sunday was a se'n-night , between 10 and 11 at Night , as I was going along the Strand , near the End of Exeter-street , I slipt into the Kennel , and fell down , for I had been to see a Friend , and was a little in Liquor . The two Prisoners coming by , pick 'd me up , and ask 'd me to make 'em drink ; I said with all my Heart , and so I went with them to a Distiller 's Shop , and bid them call for what they would , and I 'd pay for it . - They call 'd for something , and I paid something , I think it was Six-pence , but I ca n't very well tell , for I was hardly sensible . The Distiller not liking the Company I was in , advised me to leave my Watch with him , for fear I should lose it , but I told him I was able enough to take care of it myself ; so I went out with the Prisoners , and in a Minute my Watch was gone , and they run away . The Distiller follow 'd , and took Jones , but Clark got of . Jones told us Clark had got the Watch , and directed us to her Lodging , where we found her next Day , but she would not own she had my Watch , and so I lost it . Robert Rawlins . As I was shutting up Shop , the Prosecutor ( whom I knew ) came in with the Prisoners , and said he had fell down , and they had pick 'd him up , and therefore he would treat them as far as Six-pence would go , and I saw he was in ill Company , I desired him to leave his Watch with me , but he refused , and one of the Women taking him by the Arm , said , Come my dear let 's go , as I brought you in , I 'll take you out , and so they went away together , and I shut the Door ; but thinking they might pick his Pocket , I open 'd it again , and found them all three standing close together . I again desir 'd him to let me take Care of his Watch . No , says he , I warrant ye I can take care of that myself ; they must be cunning indeed , if they can get it from me . You shall see how safe it is ; but putting his Hand to his Fob to shew me . Hah ! says he , it 's gone already ! Upon that the Women both took to their Heels , I pursu 'd , and seiz 'd Jones but Clark escaped then , tho ' by Jones 's Direction I found her again next Day in St. Giles 's . The Jury acquitted them . 6 . 7. Elizabeth Atkinson , otherwise Ellis , and Elizabeth Wetherly , were indicted for privately stealing from the Person of William Dixon , a Silver Watch , and a Silver Knee-buckle , and 4 s. Dec. 14 . William Dixon . Between 11 and 12 at Night I was got fuddl 'd , and straddl 'd out of my Road into the Prisoner 's Room in Blue-Coat-Fields ; there was no Bed in the Room , but only a Joint-stool , and a Piece of an old Rug on the Ground ; but I was glad to lye down any where . They ask 'd me to give 'em a Dram , and I said I wou 'd if they 'd let me lye quiet till Morning , and not meddle with my Things ; and so as it was past my Time , I fell into a sort of a Slumber , but not fast asleep , and so they came and took my Things . I could not help myself , nor cry out , because I was fuddl 'd . I own it was a great Fault , but I desir 'd them as well as I could , to let my Things alone , tho ' they never regarded what I said , but blew out the Candle and run away . Court . This was not secretly stealing from his Person , and therefore the Prisoners must be acquitted . The Jury acquitted them . 8. Mary Jones , was indicted for stealing a Pewter-tankard , and a Sheet , the Goods of William Latham , Dec. 14 . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 9. William Byrom , was indicted for stealing , with Thomas Dun , not yet taken , a Silver Cup , value 45 s. and three Pair of Sheets , value 10 s. the Goods of Nathaniel Jacobs , in the House of Laurence Evers , Dec. 19 . Nathaniel Jacobs . I live in Laurence Evers 's House , by Moor-Fields ; I went out in the Evening , and when I returned , my Maid told me my Cup , and three Pair of Sheets were taken out of the Kitchen Window ( which is below Stairs ) while she was gone up to make the Beds - The Cup was found at a Brandy-shop in Moor-Fields ; but I do n't know who stole it . Robert Morpeth . I and Tom . Dun went from his House in the Minories , to the Prisoner 's House , by the Tenters , in Moor-Fields ; we asked him to go with us , to look for a Chance . He said he 'd go and see what could be done in the new Street , I think 't is Queen-street , which is hard by where he lives . At the farthest End we saw a Light in the Kitchen Window ; and looking over the Pallisades , says the Prisoner , there 's a Chance of a Silver Cup , if we cou 'd get at it . We soon contrived a Way . They two hoisted me over the Pallisades , into the Airey , and I listed up the Sash . I suppose the Maid had lately been washing , for some Sheets and other Things lay on a Table by the Window . I took out the Cup , three Pair of Sheets , a Shift , and a Handkerchief , and had taken more , but that we were afraid the Maid would come down and surprize us . I handed the Cup up first , and the Prisoner not being tall enough to reach it as he stood , he rais 'd himself up , and leaning over the Pallisades , took it in his Mouth ; then I gave them the Linnen , which they haul 'd through betwixt the Bars Dun helpt me up . The Prisoner gave him the Cup , and covering the Linnen with his Great-coat , carried it into the Vinegar-field , where he left it , and went Home , and returned with a Bag which he had forgot to bring out with him at first . He put the Linnen in the Bag , and so we went to Mr. Cotterel 's , a Brandy Shop in Moor-fields , and had two Quarterns of Brandy ; but the Prisoner , having the Linnen , would not go in with us , but waited without . Dun told Mrs. Cotterel , he wanted some Money , and so had taken his Wife 's Cup , and was going to sell it . Why , says Cotterel , as you look like well dress 'd Persons , and have drank here before , I 'll lend you a Guinea upon it . Dun told her that would not do , for he must sell it for two Guineas . Then , says she , I 'll let you have 38 s. and if you redeem it in a Month , it is yours ; if not , it is mine : So we struck a Bargain , she paid us the Money , and Dun , I , and the Prisoner , went to the Prisoner 's Lodging , where we made a Dividend , each Man taking a Pair of Sheets , and 12 s. 8 d. in Money . - I discovered the Robbery in about a Fortnight afterwards . I being taken up on suspicion of being concerned in another Affair . Prisoner . That Affair was a Robbery on the Highway . - You knew you were in two Informations . - You pass 'd upon me and my Wife for a Jeweller , and as you appear 'd pretty well dress 'd , we had no suspicion of you ; but when you found your Neck in danger , and you could not secure your old Companions , you made this use of a slight Acquaintance with me . Morpeth . I saw you first at a Baudy-house in Swan-yard , in the Minories , which was kept by Tom . Dun , who had been concerned with Ebenezer Dun , who was executed a Year ago * . * Ebenezer Dun was convicted in December , 1732 , of a Burglary , when Will . Byram was an Evidence for him . See the Sessions Paper Numb . 1 . Page 8 . Prisoner . The Pallisades are not so high that I needed to raise myself up , for I could look over them . I had no need to go a thieving , for I could maintain myself very well by my Work . I am a Cane-Chair-Carver by Trade , and my Father ( in-law ) is a Cane-Chair-Maker in Moor-fields . Indeed I marry 'd against his Consent , but before and after he trusted me with Money to pay the rest of his Men . Thomas Gladstone . I live in Prince's-street , in Moor-fields , the Prisoner lodged at my House ten or eleven Weeks ; he was very industrious , and behaved well . He might have ruined me , if he had not been honest , for I am a Taylor , and left my Shop open ( to him ) all Hours of the Night . Prisoner . Did I ever get drunk , or keep ill Hours , or beat my Wife ? Gladstone . Not that I know of . One Night indeed he staid till 12 , and then I let him in myself , but he brought nothing in with him . George Russel . He is my Brother-in-law . He served the latter three Years of his Time with my Father , and married soon after . He was a little wild indeed , but very honest , and kept good Hours . Will . Phillips . I work 'd with him half a Year at Mr. Martin 's ( whose Daughter he married , three Months after he was out of his Time ) and Mr. Martin trusted him with Money , to pay us our Wages , which he did very honestly , and work 'd very hard and was constant at it . Charles Crane . I worked with him at his first Master ( Mr. Questy ) 's where he behaved well , only he was a little idle sometimes , but I never knew him to be drunk : And I work 'd with him at William Thomson 's in Ratcliff-Highway , from whence he went again to his Father-in-law Mr. Martin . James Smart , Keeper of New-prison . When I took the Prisoner on Morpeth 's Information , I found him at Work , and he behav 'd well in New-prison . The Jury acquitted him , but there being another Charge against him , he was order 'd to be detain 'd . 10 Melchizedeck Kinder , was indicted for stealing 2 s. 6 d. the Money of John Bones , Sept. 1 . Acquitted . 11. Elizabeth Jones , ( not she who was try 'd with Elizabeth Clark ) was indicted for stealing two Muslin-hoods , a Silk damask-gown , value 3 l. a Handkerchief , and a Brass Frying-pan , the Goods of Rachel Montgomery , in her House , Dec. 17 . Acquitted . 12. Mary Tisden , was indicted for stealing a Doroy-coat , the Property of Hugh Harris , Dec 6 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 13,14. William Simmonds , and Samuel Steele , otherwise Smoaky Jack , assaulting William Payton , in an open Field near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Cloth-coat , a half Shirt , a Hat , a Wig , a Knife , a Fork , a Razor , a Silk-handkerchief , a Linen-handkerchief , and 20 d. in Money , July 15 . Simmonds pray 'd the Witnesses might be examin 'd a-part , which the Court granted . W. Peyton I have some Notion of the Prisoners , but ca n't swear to 'em positively . On Saturday Night I was going to Chelsea , in the first of the five Fields , from Buckingham-House , hard by the King's-Head , I saw an old Man lying under a Hay-rick , on that side next to the Horse-road , and as it was near the Houses , and I was benighted , I thought I might safely lie there too ; so I went to the other side of the Rick , and laid my self down , and fell asleep . About 1 in the Morning , a little Man ( like Simmonds ) came and snatch 'd my Pocket-book out of my Coat-pocket , I was then awake , for I had just had my Nap out . Aha ! says I , What 's that for ? And catching up my Stick , I follow 'd him . He turn 'd back , and cut me into the Skull with some Weapon , I thought it was a Pistol by the Brightness , but Fidzar , their Accomplice , says it was a Cafe-Knife . With that I lifted up my Stick to take him a Knock , when Fidzar appear 'd , and Smoaking Jack , I suppose it was he , came behind me , seiz 'd my Arm , and took my Stick away , and fell a beating and mauling me . The other , who was like Simmonds , kept pushing me in the Head with the Knife , and said , You Dog , do you resent it ? He wounded me so that my Skull might be seen in five Places , and I was almost blinded with the Blood that run down my Face I found my self over power 'd , and begg 'd for my Life : You Dog , says he with a Knife , speak another Word , and I 'll shoot you thro ' the Heart , and with that he stabb 'd the Knife against my Breast , but the Stroke falling upon the Button of my Coat , I received no hurt by it . They took my Hat and Wig , a C knife , a Fork , a Razor , a half Shirt , and 20 d. in Money , and then they wanted my Coat , which I was very for I had no Waist swore they would have it , or be the the Death of me , and so they went to beating and kicking me again and believe would have kill 'd me , but that Fidzar , who was the least of the three begg 'd for my Life , and took the Knife from Simmonds , and threw it over into the Horse-road : It was a Moon-light Night , for the Moon was at the Full ; but I was robb 'd in the Shade of the Hay-rick , and therefore I could not see their Faces so plain as certainly to know 'em again . They took my Coat , and left me for dead , and went off ; but Steel came back and gave me a Blow on the old Wound , and ask 'd me if I knew any of them , and then he beat me on the Eyes and Mouth , to hinder me from speaking or seeing , and so he went away again - Besides what I mentioned before , they took out of my Pocket a particular Thing that I kept secret , for no Body but myself knew that I had any such thing about me , and this Thing Fidzar describ 'd to me so exactly , that I was satisfy 'd he knew something of the Robbery - It was a turn 'd Stick for a Snuff-Mill . William Fidzar . I met with Simmonds at Buck 's Brandy-shop , against St. Giles's-Church , on the 14th of July , in the Morning , I was in and out there all Day . Towards the Evening , Steel came in , and we drank together ; says Simmonds to me , Will you go out with me and this Man to Night ? Ay , says I Who is he ? Why do n't you know him ? says Simmonds , it 's smoaky Jack - That 's a Nick-name that Steel goes by ; so we turn 'd out together about 11 at Night . They let me to Hide- Park , and so into the Field behind Buckingham-Wall : Now , says Simmond , let 's cross to that Hay-cock ; we agreed , and he led the Way , and coming to the Hay-cock , the Prosecutor was lying under it , Damn says Simmonds , Who 's here ? And prese took a Pocket-book out of the Prosecutor 's Pocket ; the Prosecutor got up to follow him , but was stopp 'd by Smoaky Jack , who took off his Hat and Wig , and beat him se- verely ; when his Wig was off I saw he was bald headed , tho ' he was but a middle Man . Simonds push 'd a Knife at him would have kill 'd him , but I begg 'd his , and got the Knife away ; I saw it was bent , and I toss 'd it over the Rail into the P ; but Smoaky Jack still kept beating , and kicking , and abusing him , and at last pull 'd off his Coat . They shew 'd me the Pocket-book , and a Sham-Shirt , and a little turn 'd Stick that we knew not what to make of . The Hat and Wig were in my my Hands for I had them from Smoaky , when he took 'em from the Prosecutor ; was any Mo- ney they sunk it , for I had no part of it . When we had got the Prosecutor 's Coat we left him , but getting under the Rail I saw one of the Company turn back - I believe it was Simmonds - and I and the other coming to a high Bank , we waited for him , because two of us could not get over without the Assistance of a third , and so we help 'd each other up , and went over Hedge and Ditch , 'till we came to a Ditch too wide for us , and then we return 'd by the same Hay- cock , and came to Buck 's at St. Giles 's by 3 a Clock on Sunday Morning . I wash 'd the Blood out of the Coat , and then Simmonds put it on , and Smoakey and he went away together . They to me at Buck 's , about 9 the same Morning . They two toss 'd up for their share in the Coat , Simmonds won Smoakey 's part and he was to pay me for my part ; he had the sham Shirt too , and I had the Hat and Wig ; the Wig I sold for 6 d. but the Hat ( which we valu 'd at 10 d ) I kept for my own wear . Simmonds did not go out with us that Night , but with Sutton and Stick-in-the-Mud * and a heap of them , that frequented Buck 's House . Next Morning when I came to Buck 's , expecting Simmonds would meet me there , and pay me for my part of the Coat , I heard that he , and Sutton , and others were taken up for robbing a Gentleman in Mary-bone-Fields . * James Baker , alias Stick-in-the-Mud , and John Anderson , were convicted of two Burglaries last Sessions . See the Sessions-Paper , Numb . 1. pag . 11 , 12 . Court . Have you any Witnesses here , that saw the Prisoners in your Company at Buck 's ? Fidzar . No , those that were with us were misfortunate People like ourselves . Simmonds . Was it a Moon light Night ? Fidzar . Yes , it was Full-Moon . Smoaky . You have been an Evidence three Times already . You deal with the Thief-catchers , and make a Trade of taking Men 's Lives away . Simmonds . I have been in Jail , for Want of Sureties , ever since this Robbery ; and why did not you inform against me before now ? Fidzar . This Robbery was not in my Head , 'till John Macdonald + told me that you intended to make yourself an Evidence ; and then I surrender 'd myself voluntarily . + John Macdonald , was an Evidence last Sessions against Henry Baxter , John Rock , and William Sickwell , See their Trials , Numb . I . Part I. p. 5.7. Edward Crafts , Constable . I keep a Cook's-shop , in St. Sepulchre 's Parish . About a Fortnight ago , Fidzar and the Beadle , and two or three others , came to dine at my House ; and after Dinner , the Beadle charged me with Fidzar , who had surrendered himself ; and I went with him before Justice Robe , where he impeached the Prisoners and Will .

Ann Hart and Eliz Distance , were indicted for privately stealing ( with Richard Stanley , not yet taken ) a Gold Watch , from the Person of Thomas Molden , Dec. 17 . Thomas Molden . Having parted with some Gentlemen , with whom I had been drinking Punch , and going along the Old-Bailey , between 12 and 1 in the Morning , I happen 'd to see the Prisoner , Ann Hart , standing at the Ship Alehouse -Door|| over the Way , I ask 'd her if they sold good Beer there ; she said , Yes , her Master did ; so I went in : Richard Stanley pretended to be Master , and Elizabeth Distance said she was his Wife : I sat down with him , we drank and had an Hour 's Discourse . Both the Prisoners endeavour 'd to sit by me several times ; I desir 'd him , as he was Master of the House , to keep them off , for I did not like their Familiarity . Then both the Prisoners , at times , endeavour 'd to get at my Pocket ; I told him it had an ill look , and let him know my Name , and where I liv 'd , that he might not think I would bear with ill Usage , for fear of being expos 'd . As I was near the Door , I went to go out , but found the Door was fast : I had reason to think I was in bad Hands , and feeling for my Gold-watch , I miss 'd it . I told him I was afraid he was a great Villain , and if he did not restore the Watch , I would raise the Neighbourhood , which might be of ill Consequence to them all . Says he , I 'll try what I can do for you ; but if I get it , what will you give ? I ask 'd him , What he requir 'd ? He said , he would not meddle with it under 5 Guineas . I reply 'd it was very unreasonable in him , to insist upon any thing for helping me to my Watch when he knew how it was lost ; but however , I shew 'd him 2 Guineas . Well , says he , I 'll consult about it ; and so he and the two Prisoners went aside into a Box , and order 'd me not to come near . In about 10 Minutes he call 'd me in , bid me lay down the two Guineas , and look in the Window : I desir 'd to see the Watch first , upon which he drew the Curtain , and I saw it . I clapp 'd the two Guineas on the Table , sprung to the Window , and got the Watch , intending to take up my Money again , but he took it up before me ; I re- proach 'd him with his Usage , and insisted on his returning the two Guineas ; upon which he and the two Women laid Hands on me , and drag 'd me to the farther End of the Room ; I thought my self in imminent Danger , and dragg 'd them towards the Door , and they dragg 'd me back again . Says Distance , He 'll be too hard for us , let us throw him into the Cellar . This added to my Surprize , and I told them , I hop 'd they had no design upon my Life , and again threaten 'd to alarm the Neighbourhood .

About 3 in the Morning , Nan Hart came over to me , and said she 'd give me 2 d. for a Candle : I told her I had but a Bit , and I would not part with it , and so she run back again . I heard a Screeking , and follow 'd her so close , that I thrust my Staff in between the Door and the Post , and forc 'd my Way in , and found Stanley with his Knuckles in the Prosecutor 's Throat , and the Prosecutor 's Face was as black as your Lordship 's Hat , and so I carry 'd them all before the Constable . Ann Hart . The Prosecutor came in violently , and would needs lie with Betty Distance before our Faces . He shook Hands with Mr. Stanley , and call 'd him Jack , and drank five Quarterns of Brandy with him : And in an Hour 's time , he said , Jack , I miss my Watch ; to which Mr. Stanley answer 'd .

The plank was split , and two Barrels of Anchovies taken away . William Fidzar . The Prisoner and I lodg 'd at Mrs. Whitehead 's * in Bit-Alley in Turnbull-street - Her Husband is a Watch-maker - We went thence about Midnight , and walked up and down to look for a Chance , 'till we came to the Prosecutor 's House . There the Prisoner took a sort of a Chissell and split the Flap of the Cellar-window in two , and raising up one of the pieces , I took out a Barrel of Anchovies that stood upon the Stairs ; I felt more , but they stood so close together , that we could not get another , without pulling up the remaining part of the plank , which at last , with a good deal of Trouble , I made a shift to manage , and then he took out another Barrel . We could then have got into the Cellar , but some of the Barrels rolling down the Stairs , made a Noise , and so we went off . He took one , and I another , and carry 'd them home , where we let them lie 'till Day-light , and then went with them to Mrs. Whitehead 's in Charter-house-Lane , for at that time she did not live at home , but kept out of the Way upon Account of receiving some-Plate that was stolen . We shewed her the Anchovies ; she said they were poor Stuff , and ask 'd how much we must have . I told her to take no less than 7s . 6d . The Woman of the House said , there had been a Noise about her having , stolen Goods in her House , and therefore it was not safe to leave the Anchovies - I forget her Name , but I think they call her Jenny - So they were wrap 'd up in an Apron , and sent to Mrs. Taylor , who keeps a Pawnbroker 's and Chandler 's Shop , against the Blue-Boar , in Barbican . Then the Prisoner and I took a Walk towards the Prosecutor 's , and heard the People talking about the Robbery . Coming back , we met Jenny in Smithfield : She gave us 4s . 6d . and said it was all that Whitehead could get - I surrender 'd my self , January 2 , to Mr. Claxton , who with two more went with me to Mr. Cross , the Constable , and he carry 'd me to Justice Ribe . * See more of Whitehead in the Trials of Stephen Partridge , Robert Tanner , and John Cecil , in Sessions-Paper , 1733 .

By Fidzar 's Direction I took the Prisoner at a Brandy-shop in Rosemary-Lane , and as I came with him in the Coach , he begg 'd me to speak in his Favour , or he knew he was a dead Man , for he said Fidzar was a Rogue , and had been an Evidence two or three times before , and he was sure he would take his Life away .

Stephen Ducket . I keep the Pewter-platter-Inn in St. John's-Street . My Windows were all fast at 11 at Night on the 16th of Nov. and about 9 next Morning I found the Plank of my Cellar Window had been taken up . There was the Mark of an Instrument betwixt the Curb and the Flap . The Bolts that went under the Curb were forced back . The Goods were taken out of my Cellar , and I never had any of 'em since . William Fidzar . Some Days before we to the Anchovies , the Prisoner and I went from Whitehead 's late at Night , and walk 'd about 'till we came to the Pewter-platter , and then it was 3 a Clock . The Prisoner put in his Chissel between the Plank and the Frame , and thrust one of the Bolts back , and pull 'd the Plank up . He took out his Tinder-box , and struck a Light in the Street , and putting the Box in his Pocket again , went down the Cellar and lighted a Candle below , for he carried Candles and Matches in his Pocket as well as a Tinder -box . I shut down the Window and staid to watch . In a little Time he knock 'd , and I open 'd it again . Lay hold , says he , here 's two charming Great-coats , one was Cloth , and had a Velvet Cape , and one was a blue Rug . I carried them over the Way , and left 'em on a Bulk . Then he handed up a pair of Cloth Breeches , two pair of Shoes , and a pair of Pumps ; a pair of worsted Splatter-casnes , a blue Apron , and a natural Wig ; I laid these with the Great-coat till he came and then we went down an Alley , and each of us pat on one of the Great-coats , under which we took the rest of the Things , and went to Whitehead 's . She was not up , but bid us bring the Great-coats to Taylor 's in Barbican , for the other Things we shar 'd betwixt us . We went thither , and she came to us . I told her the Coats were worth 18 s. but we must not have less than 16 . The Prisoner and I went over to the Ale-house , and in a little Time she brought us 14s . and said if that was too little , we might have the Coats again in a Fortnight . We took the Money and shared it equally , and so we went to a Brandy-shop in Rag-fair , where we used to be harboured . From thence we went to a Lodging house hard by , where we lay all Night , his Wife lay with him , and I lay in another Bed in the same Room 'T is a Sort of an Ale-house , the the Sun and Wheathead .

III . Page 82 Mary Chipperfield . I keep a Haberdasher 's Shop , and two Rooms in Mr. Gardner 's House , in Kingsland-Road . I made the Doors fast about 10 at Night and went to I was waked about 12 by the Watch , my Husband went down , but I did not . I was disturbed again between 3 and 4 in the same Manner . My Husband went down again , and I went down myself about 5 . The Pin of my Shop had been taken out , one of the Shutters was thrust back , and my Goods were gone . These three pieces of Lump-Sugar were found under the Bed where the Prisoners lay . I had the like Quantity of the same sort in my Drawer over Night , and I believe this to be the same . This Quality- binding was pick 'd up in the Street by my Door , and most of the other Things were found at William Docray 's , in George-street , Spittle-fields , where they were pawn 'd . by Mary Leach , the Prisoner Tilson 's Sister . William Tilbury , Constable . I keep the Tilbury Fort Alehouse in Shoreditch . I had the Prisoners before his Majesty the Justice of Peace , where they confess 'd , and their Consession was taken in Writing , tho ' they refus 'd to sign it ; but after they were sent to Newgate , Tilson said if we 'd let them go with us , he 'd shew us where the Goods were pawn 'd ; so we took them both handcuff 'd and they went directly to the Pawn-broker 's , where the Goods were found , and they both confess 'd there , that they took 'em out of the Shop . And Tilson told us before the Justice , that the Sugar was under his Bed . William Docray . Tilson 's Sister pawn 'd these Goods at my House . Thomas Linnel , Watchman . At past 3 in the Morning , Mr. Gardner 's Shutters were close , but about 4 I found 'em open , upon which I knock 'd and call 'd 'till I wak 'd the People of the House . John Chipperfield . A little after 12 , the Watch call 'd and said the Street Door was open . I call 'd up Mr. Gardner 's Servant , and we went down together and search 'd the House , but found no body hid , nor did I miss any thing : And so thinking the Door had been left open , carelesly I made it fast , and went to Bed again , without observing that the Key was taken out of the pin of the Windows . About 4 I was call 'd up again , and then I found that the Window-matter was open , and the Shop had been robb 'd a. I got a Warrant to search some Lodging Houses of ill Repute in the Neighbourhood . At one of those Houses we found these three Lumps of Sugar , under a Bed , and two Lads in Bed in the same Room ; we charged them . They said the Prisoner lay in that Bed last Night , and that they went out about 11 , but did not know what Time they came in again : However we took these two to the Constable 's , and while we there the two Prisoners passed by the Window , and one of those we had taken happened to see 'em , and said there goes Tilson and Worrel ! We went out and took 'em , they both cry 'd , and said we should have the Goods again . At first Tilson said they had hid them in a Brick-field , but soon after confess 'd he had given them to his Sister , who had pawn 'd 'em . I ask 'd him how they got in . He said he went down the Cellar Window ( which had no Shutter ) and so came up into the Shop , and open 'd the Street Door and let in Worrel , but hearing the Watch , he took out the Key of the Pin of the Window , and they went off . They returned between 3 and 4 , and drawing out the Pin , they put back one of the Shutters , and he went in and handed the Goods out to Worrel , who took them in his Apron . - Worrel confess 'd the same . John Gardner deposed to the same Effect . The Prisoners in their Defence said that they got drunk and found the Goods in the Road . The Jury found them guilty . Death . 30 , 31.

I saw the Goods there about 8 in Evening , and miss 'd 'em about 7 next Morning , when I found the Sash open . My Daughter lay that Night in the same Room . Ralph Mitchell * . Between 1 and 2 in the Morning , the Prisoners and I got a Ladder , and setting it against the Prosecutor 's House , I went up and open 'd the Sash . A Chest of Drawers stood by the Window . I reached as far as I could , and took out 2 Silk Skirts or Petticoats , and a Stay , which I handed down ; Peters went up next , and handed out 4 or 5 Ells of Linnen , some Caps , a Handkerchief , and several other odd Things . Simmonds stood all the while below to watch . We pack 'd them all up , and carry 'd the Bundle by Turns , to Sam Matthew 's , who then kept a Brandy-shop in Gravel-lane , in Petticoat-lane , but he is now retired . We sent him with the Bundle to Mrs. Havard in Petticoat-lane , because she knew him , and did not care to deal with Strangers He brought us three Guineas , we divided them equally .

I keep an Ale-house . The Prisoners had used my House together for a Month or six Weeks . I do n't know that Mitchell drank in their Company . - that is - out of the same Pot . Tho ' indeed he would commonly sit at the same Table with them , and they would talk jocosely together , and seemed to be acquainted . - I believe I have seen him five or six Times sitting with them and little Daniel . But when I heard their Characters , I forbid 'em my House . James Kirk . That little Daniel is a Thief . I heard him say to Simmonds , You black guard Dog , d'you see how tight I am ? Simmonds answer 'd , I should have been as tight as you , but that I was for to go to Bristol to keep out of the Way for fear of Mitchell . Peters . I know nothing of that Fellow Mitchell .

Euphanioe Kendall . I went to Bed about 12 with my Daughter who was not well ; my House is in Princes-square , in Ratcliff-highway . We lay up one pair of Stairs . One of the Window-shutters was left open , but the Sash was down . My Daughter wak 'd about one , and call 'd for a little Drink . My Drawers rattl 'd , and she said what is that Mother ? Presently I heard some-body at the Window , at first I thought it was my Maid . Catherine , says I , why d'you sit sleeping there ? Why do n't you go to Bed ? But immediately recollecting myself , Lord bless me ! says I , she went to Bed when I did ! So I got up and run to the Window and found the Sash open . I saw something move before me , as far off as my Hand is , but what it was I can not tell , for I could not see Head nor Face , and so I call 'd out Thieves , and I afterwards found a Ladder left standing against the Window . I lost a Silver-tankard , three silver Spoons , a Velvet manteel , a Cambrick-hood , and a pair of silk Shoes and Clogs . Ralph Mitchell . The Prisoners and I got a Ladder . Peters went up first , and handed down a silver-Tankard , and three silver Spoons . Simmonds went up then and brought out a Manteel , a Sarcenet ( a Cambrick ) Hood , and a pair of Shoes and Clogs . Somebody in the House making a Disturbance , we got him down as fast as we cou 'd , and left the Ladder behind us . We went to Sam Matthews 's , who sold the Manteel , Hood , Shoes and Clogs , to Mrs. Havard for 18s . and I sold the Tankard and Spoons to Rodenham ( who was convicted last Sessions ) for 5 l. and we shar 'd the Money equally . Peters . Why did not you prosecute last Sessions ? Mitchell . Because I did not know you was then a Prisoner . Peters . But you sent your Wife to tell me that you did not know me , and had nothing to lay to my Charge . Mitchell . No I sent her to Harry Whitesides , for I knew nothing of your being in Custody .

I cry 'd out . He knock 'd me down ( I believe it was with his Fist ) cut my Hand in three places , and tore off my Mob ( and some of my Hair with it ) , and leaving me on the Ground , ran away . I got up frighted and went to my Husband , and told him how I had been served by a lusty Man in a Dray-man 's Apron ; for I saw him plainly , by the Light in a Chandler 's almost opposite to me , and a Lamp that was hard by . My Husband and some of the Company with him , pursued the Prisoner , and brought him back to the Coach and Horses , and I saw my Mob then in his Bosom , next to his Shirt , a Neighbour took it out , and here it is . I charged him directly . Prisoner . You said before the Justice that you did not know me . Ann Baker . No I said I could not swear to your Face , but to your Bulk and your Apron , which I catch 'd hold of . Catherine Elkins . As I was standing at the Coach and Horses ( a Distiller 's ) I saw the Prisoner go by , and offer to meddle with a Woman over the Way , but she got from him , and he going forward , I heard a Woman cry , - and soon after , Mrs. Baker came up without her Head-clothes , and the blood running down her Arm . She said do n't be frighted but I am almost kill 'd by a Rogue that has pull 'd my Cap off . - I call 'd Mr. Baker , and he and others ran out and brought the Prisoner back .

No I stood behind you , and saw you take it out . Caleb Baker . My Wife came to me at the Coach and Horses . Her Cap was off , and her Arm bloody from her Elbow to her Fingers .

I got up and run after him . He knock 'd me down again under the Gate-house . I cry 'd Murder , and stop Thief . He pull 'd a Knife out of his Pocket , and swore he 'd cut my Throat if I resisted . I run into the middle Way , I follow 'd him close - Mr. Drew took him , and I said , That 's the Man that robb 'd me of my Handkerchief ; and I am positive to him , for when he first knock 'd me down , there was a Light in a Window just by us .

I waited above to look out ; the Watch coming by past 11 , I bid him lie close , and stepp 'd aside ; but they taking no notice , I return 'd to my post . The Prisoner brought up one Firkin , which I set by , and then he fetch 'd another , and each of us taking one , we carry 'd them to Whitechapel-Mount , and cover 'd them with Dung . We staid there till 4 a Clock , and then went to Church 's Shop , for we knew she would be up by that time . When it was light , I propos 'd we should fetch them ; but the Prisoner being very sleepy would not go himself , but gave another Man ( we call him French Peter ) Six-pence to bring one of them . Peter and I went together and brought them to Church 's . Where they stood all Day , for we could not find a Chap . Next Morning I met Sarah Anderson ( who buys old Clothes in the Fair ) and another Woman . They tasted one of the Firkins , we ask 'd them Two pence Half-penny a Pound , they bid us 2 d. and we agreed to it . The Firkins weigh 'd about half a Hundred and eight Pounds a-piece , but one of them not proving so good as the other , the Women would give us but 16 s. for the Whole . We knew not where to mend our Market , and so we consented to take their Money : Anderson carry 'd one away , and I carry 'd the other , to a House hard by , to which I afterwards directed the Prosecutor ; but it was gone before he came . She said she would come to Church 's and pay us . I went to eat a ha ' p'orth of boil 'd Potatoes in the Fair , and going back to Church 's I met Anderson , who told me she had paid the Money to the Prisoner . I went to him , and he gave me 8 s. for my half - No , it was but 7 s , 9 d. for we had two Pots of Cherry-beer , which he paid for out of the Whole . Prisoner . I never had any Acquaintance with Fidzar - Indeed I have spoke to the the Fellow at the Brandy-shop : but no body ever saw me in his Company , and I have heard he has been an Evidence . His Creature came to me in Newgate , and said , Aye you Rogue , he shall get the Reward for banging you , and then he 'll live honest . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . Second Indictment . John Thayer , I live at the upper End of Brick-Lane . My Cellar-window was broke open between 1 and 4 in the Morning . The Clamp , that goes into the Frame , was broke , and the Plank that flaps down was lifted up at one end , and a Box , and two Casks of Tobacco were taken out of my Cellar - The empty Casks and Box were found in a Field behind my House by some Workmen William Fidzar . The Prisoner and I took two Bags , and went from Church 's Shop about one in the Morning , to get what we could light on . We came to this Brandy-shop ( the Prosecutor 's ) in Brick-Lane , I flung back two flat Bolts with an Iron , and wrenched the Plank up . I struck a Light in my Tinder-box , and gave it the Prisoner , who went down and lighted a Candle below ; some Butchers came along with a Hurricane of Marrow-bones and Cleavers . I bid him lie snug , 'till they were all gone by , which he did , and then brought up a Cask , and a Box of Tobacco . He went down a second Time , and brought another Cask . We carry 'd them into a Field behind the House , and empty 'd them into our Bags , and so went to Church 's , leaving the empty Casks and Box behind us . We order 'd a Hot-pot , and sat by the Fire till Day-light . I sent a Boy for Tom Pattison , who had bought Goods of us before . Tom , says I , here 's some Tobacco that Trevis and I got last Night , and if you can dispose of it we 'll give you 2 s. The two Bags weigh 'd about 50 lb . He took one , for which he brought us 13 s. He said it came to 14 s. but he was oblig 'd to spend a Shilling at the House . He scrupl 'd sometime to take the other Bag , but at last he took it , staid two Hours , and then brought us 14 s. We gave him 2 s. for his pains , and the Prisoner and I shar 'd the Money equally - Pattison now keeps out of the Way . Prisoner . I never saw this Fellow with my Eyes . Fidzar . We became acquainted in October last . He told me that he broke out of New-Prison , and that he was an Evidence against Long-Will - I think it was Long-Will - And some others . Prisoner . When Harry Whitesides was taken you were afraid he would swear against you , and so you went to these Thief -catchers , who make it their Business to take away People 's Lives , and so you pretended that you came in voluntarily . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 48. James Macdowald , was indicted for assaulting Susan Cox , on the Highway , putting hera in Fear , and taking from her a silk Purse , Guinea , and a Queen Elizabeth 's sixpence , Dec. 27 . Mary Bales . On the 27th of December , between 8 and 9 in the Morning , I was going with Mrs. Cox , in Dr. Mead 's Coach from Kensington , to St. Albans - Near Kensington-Gravel-Pits , the Prisoner rode up to the Coachman , and bid him stand , which the Coachman not minding , the Prisoner call 'd out again , Stand ! and then the Coachman stopt , and the Prisoner came to the Coach-door with a Pistol in his Hand , and demanded our Money and Watches ; we were in a great Fright . Mrs. Cox said , Pray Sir be easy , you shall have what we have , and pulling out a red Silk-purse , she gave it him ; but I do n't know what was in it . I know she had a Queen Elizabeth 's Six-pence , which she us 'd to carry in that Purse , but as the Purse was not open 'd , I did not see it then - The Coach glass was half up when he came to the Door , but he bid us put it down , and I did , and then , as I said , he demanded our Watches ; Mrs. Cox told him she had none ; and I said I had none neither , for I was but a Servant . He answer 'd , God damn you , I saw your Watches in the Morning - When he had got the Purse , he look 'd both Ways and went off . I cry 'd , Stop Highwayman : Mrs. Cox 's Servant rid after him - A Ploughman threw his Staff at him , and he was taken soon after - I am sure this is Mrs. Cox 's Purse , and this is her Queen Elizabeth 's Six-pence , for I have often seen them both , and am positive the Prisoner is the Man . John Keen . I was on Horseback before the Coach - The Prisoner rid up to the Coach door , before you come to Bay's-Water by the Gravel-Pitts , I heard him demand their Watches , and I am certain he 's the Man that robb 'd my Lady , Mrs. Cox - When he left the Coach , they cry 'd , Highwayman , and I pursu 'd him to Brompton , where he quitted the Horse , and was taken by a Farmer and another Man in a Garden - Indeed my Horse tumbled , and I lost fight of him for a little while , but I saw him again just after he had dismounted . James Hutchins . Coming from Little-Chelsea , on Thursday in Christmas Week , I saw Thomas Ruberry riding hard over the Field ; What 's the Matter , says I , A Highwayman ! says he . Then I saw the Prisoner run to the Pallisades of a Garden and get over , and when I came to the Pallisades , he he was creeping under some Elm tree Boughs to hide himself . I got over , and he came to me , and said he was my Prisoner , and a dead Men . I collar 'd him , and led him four Rod by myself , and then Perrin and Tarrant came to me . We search 'd him , and found this red Silk-purse in his right Pocket . There was a Guinea , a Queen Elizabeth 's Sixpence - I believe this is the same - and some other Silver in it - Going to the Justice 's he begg 'd me not to let the Justice see the Purse . Prisoner . You took more Money from me Twenty Shillings out of my Coat Pocket . Hutchins . The Money was all put together before the Justice . John Perrin . As I was going home , in Ayre 's Court , in Kensington Parish , I heard a Noise of Highwayman ! and mounting my Horse , I pursu 'd and got Sight of him in the Garden . I quitted my Horse , and leap 'd over the Pales - Hutchins was with me , and the Prisoner said he was our Prisoner , and desir 'd us not to abuse him . Joseph Griffin . The Lady 's Servant follow 'd the Prisoner up Earl's-Court-Lane , by Holland-Walk , but his Horse falling , he lost sight of the Prisoner , and I made the best of my way to the Turnpike to give Notice . Joseph Biggs . I was at Plough at Bay's-Water-Hill . A Lad ( Robin Spencer ) stopt his Cart , and said , There 's a Highwayman ! I turn 'd about , and saw the Prisoner 's Head in the Coach , and coming from it he put his Hand in his right Pocket . I catch 'd up my Plough-staff and made up to him , and coming pretty near I threw my Staff at him ; he bob 'd his Head , and off dropp 'd his Hat and Wig . I am not sure hit them off , but if he had not bob 'd I should have knock 'd him down - There 's the Hat with the Dirt upon it , but I did not take up the Wig . I ask 'd the Lady , If she was robb 'd ? She said , Yes , of a Purse and some Money . Why then , says I to the Servant , for God 's Sake , why do n't you follow him , for he ca n't go far ? And so he set Spurs to his Horse - The Prisoner had a Pistol in his Hand when he pass 'd me , but he dropped it 20 or 30 Yards beyond me by the white Gates , and a Waggoner took it up - After the Prisoner was taken he own 'd this to be his Hat . William Atwood . The Case is this - I live at Brompton . And as my Man Sanders and I were at work in my Yard , we heard Words . Two Women were with the Prisoner , and he was discoursing them to take his Mare . So I goes up to him , and he was very dirty and his Mare too , and says he , I beg of you , Sir , to take my Mare , and my Whip , and my Great-Coat , and I beg you , Sir , not to say which way I am gone , for I am a dead Man . So I took care of the Whip and the Great-Coat , and gave the Mare to my Man to put into my Stable , and then I pursu 'd the Prisoner , and found he was taken in the Garden by Perrin , and Hutchins , and Tarrat - He had no Hat nor Wig on , but only a red Cap . There was a Guinea , a Crown , a half Crown , a Queen Elizabeth 's Six-pence , and some other Silver - Here 's the Coat and Whip . Prisoner . Did not I fling a Watch , some Silver , and a half Guinea upon the Great-Coat ? Thomas Tarrat . The Lady 's Man stopp 'd at our Door , and enquir 'd if we did not see a Highwayman upon a grey Mare . Says my Wife , There he goes . Perrin jump 'd over the Pales , and seiz 'd him first , and Hutchins took hold of him soon after * . A silk Purse was taken from the Prisoner with a Guinea , a Crown , a half Crown , Six pence and three Farthings . * Hutchins swears that he himself was the first who seiz 'd the Prisoner . Edward Banks . Riding from Kensington Gravel-pits , I saw the Lady 's Servant pursuing the Prisoner , and he call 'd out for God 's sake stop him . And the Prisoner cry 'd , for God 's sake let me pass , which I did , as fearing he had Fire-arms , tho ' when he had got about 100 Yards , I follow 'd , and thought I should have overtaken him , but he turn 'd up Earl's-Court-Lane , and made towards Brompton a Village about a Quarter or a Mile from thence , and I lost Sight of him . Robert Chester , Constable . I follow 'd the Prisoner to Brompton , and took him into Custody ; he pray 'd me to keep him from the Mob , and lend him a Bible . I told him I had none about me , but he should have one , and other good Books at my House . I carry 'd him before Justice Vincent , who made his Mittimus to Newgate . I thought it was then too late , and unsafe to carry him thither that Evening , and so I kept him all Night in my own House , and next Morning carry 'd him in a Coach to Newgate . By the Way he own 'd to me that he had robb 'd Mrs. Cox - There was a Report that one Downs a Baker who had done it , but that was a Mistake . The Jury found him guilty . Death . 49 , 50.

Sessions-Paper , Numb , 4 . Pag . 114. Elizabeth Rumney . I had a Room and part of a Shop in Mary Everet 's House in Rosemary-lane . - It 's four Years ago come next June since I was robb 'd . My Landlady lay in the Shop . I shut it up , and made the Windows fast as soon as it was dark . About 2 in the Morning my Landlady call 'd me up , and said the Shop was robb 'd . I found one Shutter half crawn off , and the Sash lifted up . I lost three Shirts of William Preston 's which I had to make , two Dozen of Handkerchiefs , a strip 'd Shirt and 3 Quarters of a Pound of Tea , which were my own Goods , for I sold Coffee , Tea , Sugar and Tape , and such kind of Things . - Last Friday John Oak sent Fame to Wood-street-compter , and told me that he and the Prisoners were the Persons that robb 'd me . John Oak . On Saturday Night ( 4 Years ago next June ) I went to Mr. Collins 's against the Glass-house at Salt-Peter-Bank in Rosemary-lane , where I met the Prisoners , whom I had seen there divers Times before . They ask 'd me to go out with them that Night . I agreed to it , and coming down Rosemary-lane , about 9 at Night , we saw the Prosecutor 's Door open . I slipt in , took the Key out of the Pin of the Window , and then we went away together , to see if we could find another Chance , but not meeting with any , we returned about 2 in the Morning . I took out the Pin of the Window , threw it in the Kennel , pull 'd the Shutter half off , and Whitesides went in while Ford and I stood watching without , and Whitesides handed out three Shirts , a silk Handkerchief , and eighteen Cotton Handkerchiefs , which I took in my Apron . There was a Woman in Bed in the Shop , and she cry 'd out Thieves . I went down a Turning by the Side of the House and hid the Goods , and when I return 'd the Prisoners were gone , but I found them two Hours after at Collins 's . - One that buys stolen Goods , but keeps a private House . - Whitesides was an Evidence against his Wife three Years ago . - I told the Prisoners where I had left the Goods , and at 9 in the Morning we went to fetch 'em . I took 'em away , and carry 'd them to the Brill near Pancras , and sold 'em all but one Shirt to Ann Taylor , - her right Name is Prichard . Court . Could you venture to fetch 'em at that time of Day , from a Place so near the House that was broke open ? Oak . I left 'em on a Dunghill , and covered them with Bean-shells . The Prisoners stood at the End of the Turning to watch , and the Turning goes thro ' from Rosemary-Lane , so that I did not come back by the House , but went out at to'ther End , and the Prisoners follow 'd me . - Nax Taylor gave us 12 s. for two of the Shirts , half a Crown for the silk Handkerchief , and a great Piece for the Cotton ones . I kept the other Shirt , and allow 'd 6 s. for it . We dined there and spent 13 s. in Punch . - The Goods we sold ( with the 6 s. for the Shirt ) came to 26 s. and 6 d. and the Reckoning being paid , there remain 'd 13 s. and 6 d. which we shar 'd equally , and had 4 s. 6 d. a piece . We staid there 'till 8 in the Evening , and then came to Town together , and parted in Cheapside . I have had no Correspondence with them since , any farther than drinking with them . Court . How came you to conceal this so long and discover it at last ? Oak . I had done a great many wicked Things , and thinking it Time to reform , I surrender 'd myself , and so was sent to the Compter . Court . Was there no Warrant out against you ? Oak . Not that I know of . Ford . Did not John Wells ( who has been an Evidence , and is now turn 'd Thief-catcher ) send you to Shrewsbury to keep you clear of the Information of Will . Morris , who is in Custody at Norwich ? Oak . No . Whitesides . Can you prove I was ever in your Company ? Oak . Philip Lacey in Petticoat-lane , where they lodged , and others , at whose Houses I have often drank with them , can prove it , but I could not get them to come thither . - Ford has been try 'd several Times . The Jury acquitted them . 51.

The Beginning of January , two Years ago , five Tea-spoons , a pair of Tea-tongs , and two silk Handkerchiefs , were stollen off my Tea-Table in the Parlour . We miss 'd them about 11 at Night , when we were going to Bed . Whether the outer Window Shutters were open or not I can not tell , but there was nothing broke . John Oak sent for me to Woodstreet-Compter , and said he had robb 'd me three Times within these two Years . That he stole the Goods in the Indictment in January .

Alderman BARBER gave me a free Discharge on the Saturday , and on the Monday I went to work , and have work 'd ever since 'till I was taken . - Is there any Body that knows I kept you Company ? Oak .

I was only for having two Wives . - I was try 'd for nothing else . - This Noaks ( Oak ) was sent for out of the Country by Wells the Thief -catcher , to be an Evidence , as Wells himself told me . - And this Wells has been try 'd for two or three Felonies .

The first Time I saw Oaks was but 13 Months ago . - It being wet Weather I went into an Ale-house in White-fryars , and hung my Hat to dry by the Fire , and a Man there took off my Wig at the same time , under Pretence of looking on it , and I turning my Back , he slipt away with it . The Woman of the House told me his Name was John Barber . - I took a Warrant against him from Justice Brain 's , on which Account he kept out of the Way , but his Wife said if I 'd be content , I should have my Wig again , and the Charge of the Warrant . I told her I desired no more ; then she said her Husband had sold the Wig for half a Crown , to one John Oak in Newtoner's-lane , and so she gave a Man a Crown to redeem the Wig , and sent him with me ; where I found Oak . I told him he had bought a Wig that was taken off my Head ; and he said he would not deliver it without the Money it cost him , and half a Crown to be spent , - and this was the first of my Acquaintance with Oak . Oak . I bought the Wig of Barber for half a Crown , not knowing it was stolen , and it cost me 6 d. to have it mended , and therefore I insisted upon 3s . and for all what he says , I knew him five Years ago ; but as we frequented disorderly Houses , the People that kept them do n't care to appear . Prisoner . About two Months ago ; I saw Oaks 's Wife at the Ale-house in White-fryars , she had got a Warrant against four Men for snatching her Pocket , and I said to her , Why should you be so severe , if I had been so severe to your Husband , it might have been worse for you , and Oak has ow 'd me a Grudge ever since . - But if I am guilty , God Almighty-grant the Jury may find me so , and that I may suffer .

I suppose some Body there had got a Buckle from her , for I heard her say , Now I can bang you for taking that Buckle . She was ask 'd how she could be so barbarous to serve the Man so ?
