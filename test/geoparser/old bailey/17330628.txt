The Prisoner came to my Shop on London-Bridge , and desired to see some weighty Gold-Rings . I shew 'd him two that were very heavy . He seem 'd to be well pleas 'd with them , and call 'd for Pen and Ink to set down the Weight and Value . I began to suspect that he wanted to make off , and I happen 'd to think right , for he took up the two Rings and ran out ; I follow 'd , as well as the Gout would let me , and cry 'd , Stop Thief ! He was soon seiz 'd , and when I came up to him he had the two Rings in his Hand , and I took them out my self . Prisoner . I had bought a Rings of the Prosecutor some time before , and I afterwards found that he had charged me 5 s. more than they were worth , and so because I would not be cheated again , I took these two Rings to shew to a Friend before I paid for them .

Mary Brian and Ann Atkinson , were indicted for privately stealing 17 yards of Printed Linen , in the Shop of William Roper , May 28 . Hannah Slight , the Prosecutor 's Servant . The Prisoners came into my Master 's Shop in Chiswel street , the Corner of White Cross street , and said they wanted some Printed Linen ; my Mistress took down 3 Peices . They looked over the third Piece particularly , but at last did not like it . My Mistress shew 'd 'em several more Pieces , and at last took down all the Printed Linens on the Shelf . They said they wanted 14 Yards , but when they had pitch 'd upon one Piece they would have but 6 Yards ; they agreed upon the Price , and it came to 16 s. and Brian gave my Mistress 2 half Guineas , which , my Mistress , having some Suspicion of them , gave me to change . I observed Brian drawing something under her Peticoats with a Hitch and a Hitch thus - but did not then imagine she had stole any thing , for I thought her Peticoat was got loose and that she was tying it up , and I did not care to speak of it because there were some Men in the Shop . As soon as the Prisoner were gone out , my Mistress look 'd over her Goods and mist the third Piece , which was printed with a small Sprig . My Master and some others ran after them down Chiswel street , and I follow 'd them into the Black Raven Alehouse . The Linen , it seems , was not found upon them , but they were carried before Justice Robe ; and while they were gone thither Mr. Brian , the Landlord of the Raven , came to me with the Piece of Linen , and said his Maid found it dropt behind a Door in an Entry , thro ' which the Prisoners went to be searched ; I knew the Piece , by the Shop-mark , to be the same that was lost . Atkinson . It was not Mrs. Brian , but I , that bought and paid for the 6 yards of Linen . Jonathan Graves . I was in the Prosecutor 's Shop when the Prisoners were there , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Roper mist a piece of small sprig Linen , and said , Run Husband , Run Father . They ran and I with them , and we found the Prisoners at Mr. Brian 's . Prisoner Brian . Were there not a great many People in the House when we were searched ? Graves . Yes , 50 or more . P. Brian . The Men searched us in the Kitchen , as far as Modesty would permit , and then the Women carried us thro ' a Passage into a back Room and searched us to our Shifts , but found nothing . Benjamin Eaves . I only felt on the out-side of their Cloathes thus - and no body searched them any farther in the Kitchen . But the Linen might be folded up so as not easily to be felt by such a slight Search . Mr. Brian 's Maid is gone out of the way , I suppose she is bought off , for I was offer 'd 12 Guineas , and my Son 20 Guineas to make it up , by some of the Prisoners Friends . Court . But was it by the Prisoners Orders ? Eaves . I ca n't say that . Mr. Brian . The Prisoners came to my House and called for a Pint of Three-threads . Presently Mr. Eaves and his Son follow 'd and charged them with stealing a Piece of Printed Linen ; upon which they were searched in the Kitchen , by feeling about the out-side of their Cloaths ; but nothing being found they were taken thro ' a dark Passage into the back Room to be searched privately by the Women , and nothing was found on them there neither . However , they were carried before the Justice . Presently after they were gone my Maid , Sarah Stone , going to fetch a Table-Cloth out of a little Cupboard , in the Passage the Prisoners had past thro ' , and opening the Door she trod on something behind the Door , and taking it up she call 'd to me and said , Here is the Printed Linen . I took it and carried it to Mrs. Roper 's , and her Maid said that was the very Piece that had been lost , and afterwards it was carried to the Justice , and here it is . Court . Were not several People in that Passage besides the Prisoners ? Mr. Brian . Nobody at that time , besides my own Family . Prisoners . There were numbers of People . Mr. Brian . Yes , about my Bar there was so many that I could hardly stand for them , but not in the Passage . Court . Did you see your Maid take the Linen up ? Mr. Brian . No ; but she came out and gave it me directly . Court . But her saying she found it there is no Evidence , except she was here to swear it . Where is she ? Mr. Brian . She 's gone out of the Way , under Pretence of going to see her Mother . Court . Then here 's nobody to prove that this Linen is the very Piece that she found . Henry Morris . I keep an Ale-house in the Burrough , I have known the Prisoner Atkinson 5 Years , she goes a Nursing , I never heard she was concern 'd in any Crime before , and was surpriz 'd to hear this . Henry Leach . I have known her about 5 Years too ; she was my Nurse and behaved exceeding well . The other Prisoner , Brian , lodged 2 Years in my House and made Mantua 's . Hannah Slight , again . Brian told me she lived in the Country , but when she was before the Justice she said she lived at the Bear in Wild-street . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 8.

I saw him pull out his Watch , and put it into his Fob again . Then he bid me call him up at 6 in the Morning , and so I left them together . Prisoner . Hark you , Landlady , do n't you remember that you and your Husband were whipt for keeping a Bawdy-House ? Humph . What 's that to you ? - Next Morning I found my Door broke open I ran up in a Fright , and waked the Prosecutor . He said he had lost his Watch and 2 Rings , and a Guinea and half . I told him she had a Loadging in the Neighbourhood , and I 'd find her if possible , but when I went thither she was gone from thence . Prisoner . Hussy , you lie ; you are a vile Toad , a vile old Baud ; you lie , you lie , you lie . Humph . Then the Prosecutor took me up the same Morning ( it was Wednesday ) and the Prisoner was taken at Night . I bid her help the Man to his Watch again , but she said it was too far gone ; but if I would say that I had never seen the Watch , we should both be discharged . Eleanor Kelly . The Prisoner and I lodged in the same House . She came home about 2 a Clock that Wednesday Morning , and calling to her Husband , Jack ! Jack ! He let her in , and then she told him she had got a Trisle , and must go off again : At the same Time she shew 'd me 2 Rings . Then she went out , and came home again about Noon very drunk . She had a Silver Watch in her Hand . She threw it down upon the Health , and then tumbled upon the Bed and fell asleep . I took the Watch up again and put it in her Hand . Prisoner .

I have lately had her 4 or 5 times in my Custody for the like Facts . Prisoner . Well , if you have , that 's no reason I must be guilty of this too . So many against one is a little hard . It 's well known I am no bold Woman . He pick 'd me up , and said he would lye with me , if I could carry him to an honest House , and I went with him to Mother Humphries 's , tho ' much against my Will , but he would take no Denial . He gave her a Shilling for a Loadging . She sent for a Pint of Anniseed , and the reckoning came to a Crown , which be paid , and then we went up to Bed .

We were both disorder 'd with drinking , but especially my Friend . Mr. Creamer refused us Admittance , and a Chair coming to the Door , my Friend was getting into it , but Mr. Creamer bid the Chairman not let him ; upon which the Chairman took my Friend by the Collar , and turn 'd him out . This provok 'd me so far , that I was going to strike the Chairman , when presently the Prisoner came up and struck me in the Face , and so he and I went to fighting . He fell down and pulled me over him , at which time I felt my Watch drawn from me .

The Prisoner and Prosecutor were both down . I saw the Prisoner grapple in the Kennel . The Prosecutor said his Watch was drawn from him . The Prisoner ran and hid himself under a Gate till the Pursuers past him , but I turning back found him there wiping his Hands . Prisoner . Did not you say I put my Hand 3 times in the Kennel , and pulled out a Gold Watch ? Howard . I said I saw your Hand in the Kennel . Prisoner . Coming along I saw a great Mob , and some a-fighting . One of the Men that fought said he had lost 8 Guineas . Mr. Creamer lost 2 Handkerchiefs , and some lost their Hats . As for the Watch , I know nothing of it , only that Harry Dod , who is a Prisoner here , told me to Day that he Knew who had it . But when I was taken there was nothing found upon me . I have some Witnesses to my Character . Warner Parry . I have known him 7 or 8 Years . He work 'd for the Fishmongers , and had a pretty good Character formerly , but of late he has kept Company with common Pick-pockets , and I have seen him make a pass at several Gentlemens Pockets . Mr. Crotchet , Fishmonger at Temple-Bar He lived about a Year with me ( 3 Years ago ) and before that he lived 5 Years with Mr. Weston the King 's Fishmonger at the Corner of Bell-Yard , and I was Journeyman there at the same Time .

The Money was lock 'd up in a Cupboard , and she got the Keys out of my Coat Pocket when I was a-bed ; and when she had taken the Money , she came and put the Key in again . Court . How do you know ? J. D. My Eye-sight is not very good ; but she came to my Bed side early in the Morning , and I saw her Hand in my Coat Pocket , and then she slipt away ; and besides , nobody but she could do it , because nobody else was there . She ran away next Day * , and I mist my Money 2 or 3 Hours afterwards ; for , having a Suspicion upon her going away , I went to my Cupboard , which I found Lock 'd , and in which I had left 50 Guineas ; I found that 24 of them and 33 s. 6 d. had been taken away . * Probably he meant the same Day : The Fact ( as appears by her Confession ) being done about One in the Morning .

I found upon her 12 Guineas , 2 half Guinea 3s . 6d . and a Groat , which she own 'd she had robb 'd her Master of .

Mary Oaks . The Prisoner lived 3 Months in my Sister 's Service , and was discharged the 3d of May . I was present when she made the Confession my Sister has sworn to . Elizabeth Hulm .

Elizabeth Woodnot . I live in Angel-Court , by Story 's in Westminster , and being not very well , I went out for a Dram to a neighbouring Distiller 's , between 10 and 11 at Night , and there I saw the Prisoner , and a Soldier , and a Woman ; I return 'd home , and the Prisoner follow 'd to my own Door . There are Steps to the Door , and going up , I put the Key into the Lock to open it , at which Time I felt somebody behind me , and fearing it was some Rogue who intended to get into the House , I turn 'd about suddenly and cry 'd out . He made an Offer to strike me , and I believe would have knock 'd me down , but being aware of it , I partly shunn 'd the Force of the Blow . so that he did not hurt me . Upon which he catch 'd hold of my Cloak and tore the String ( and if the String had not been torn , he pull 'd 10 hard that I might have been choak 'd ) . However , I got hold of one part of the Cloak , and he still pull 'd to get it from me . My crying out had alarm 'd some of the Neighbours , and John Williams came out , and saw the Prisoner pulling the Cloak , which he got from me , and ran away before Williams could stop him , but he was stopt presently after , and dropt the Cloak . Court . Are you sure the Prisoner is the Man ? E.W . Yes . It was Moon-light , and besides , he is a Westminster Man , and I had seen him several times before - John Williams catch 'd him in his Arms ; not the John Williams who came out first , and who is a Carpenter , but another John Williams a Chairman ; and after he was taken , he fir 'd a Pistol at Mr. Hilliard . Prisoner . Which side of your Cloak did I take hold of ? Did I Discharge a Pistol at you ? I know I was elevated . E.W . I did not say you did . Mr. Hilliard . As I stood at my own Door , in Angel-Court , I heard a cry of stop Thief , and going to the End of the Court , I saw two Chairmen who had stopt a Man . They said he had robb 'd Mrs. Woodnot ; they had not hold of the Prisoner , but they [ and others ] surrounded him . I ask 'd them why they did not secure him ? They said , they could not stay , because they were obliged to wait upon their Matter ( Mistress ) but they hop 'd I would take care of him , and so he was deliver 'd to me . I collar 'd him , and brought him back up the Court , attended by several others . After he had struggled hard to get away , but without Success , the People pressing about him , Sir , says he , you have me now in your power , but I hope you wo n't let me be stifled , give me liberty to breathe a little . By all means , says I , and so the Crowd making way , he set his Back against the Wall , but I still held him by the Collar ; he put his Hand down , but whether to his Pocket or Bosom I can not be certain , and presently the People cry 'd , Have a Care ! there 's a Pistol ! I saw the Pistol presented at my Head , but my surprise was so great that I can not take upon me to say , whether 't was he or any other who held it . The Pistol was immediately fir 'd but as it happen 'd no Mischief was done . Upon this I carry 'd him , and threw him down , and others assisting we tyed him , and carry 'd him to the Watch-house . Prisoner . See here ! I am Lame in my Hand ! how can a lame Man fire a Pistol ? John Williams , Carpenter . My House is next but one to the Prosecutor 's , I heard her cry , Murder ! Stop Thief ! upon which I ran out , and saw the Prisoner then disengaging himself from her . He ran away , I cry 'd out , Stop Thief , and so did he too ; but however , he was stopt by a Chairman . I had left my Door open , and as soon as I saw he was taken , I went back to lock it , which when I 'd done , I went down the Court again , and met Mr. Hilliard , and others bringing the Prisoner up . The Prisoner said he was an innocent lame Man , and never did an ill Thing in his Life . After some struggle , he said , he hop 'd we 'd give him leave to fetch his Breath ; and so setting his Back against the Wall , I saw him put his Hand downward to his Pocket or Bosom , I ca n't say which , and pull out a Pistol and fire it . Upon which Mr. Hilliard knock 'd him down , and I wrenched the Pistol out of his Hand , and then we bound him and search 'd him . We found loose Gun-powder in every Pocket , and in one there were 2 or 3 Cartridges , and some small pimple Stones ( Pebbles ) which I suppose were to serve for Bullets . We were forced to carry him by main Strength to the Watch-house , for he would not walk one step that way ; it was then too late to go before the Justice , and so for better Security we carry 'd him the same Night from the Watch-house to the Gate-house . Next Day I went in the Coach with him to Newgate , and going along , he damn 'd me for a Son of a Bitch , and swore if he had a Knife , he 'd stick me in the Guts . Prisoner . Where are those Pebble-Stones ? J. W .. I do n't know , I believe they were thrown away , but here 's the Pistol , the Cartridges , and the loose Powder . Morris Williams , Chairman . Our Chair stands at Angel-Court End , by Story 's Steps . We heard a cry of Stop Thief , and the Prisoner came running and crying stop Thief too ; my Partner stopt him , and he drop 'd the Cloak , and I took it up ; we deliver 'd him to Mr. Hilliard , because we were going to carry a Lady . This is the Cloak , and here the String is broke . Prisoner . Did you see me take the Cloak off ? M.W . No , not I. Prisoner . I would ask the Gentlewoman if it was in the King 's Highway or in the House , that I took her Cloak off ? Mrs. Woodnot . It was at my Door , before I had open 'd it . John Williams , Chairman . Upon the crying stop Thief , the Prisoner came running down like mad , and crying Stop Thief as fast as any Body . I stood thus , - and he ran into my Arms , and my partner took up the Cloak . Prisoner . How could a Man that is lame in his Hands , run and cry Stop Thief ? J. W. ha ! Prisoner . Can you swear that I took the Cloak of o ' your Back ? J.W . My Back ? That 's another wise Question . Prisoner . How far from me was the Cloak f ? J.W . About a Yard . R Blunt , Constable Upon searching we seen Powder in every ready made little Pebble stones , which I threw you Mr. Constable , I 'll swear you pick 'd my Pocket of Then he threw himself into and put his Body in such odd would pise one ; I have known these 20 Years ; he was transported about 14 Years ago , for cutting the back of a Coach , and stealing a Gentleman 's Wig * . * William Sadwell , was indicted for stealing a Perriwig , value 6 l. from Francis Negoes , Esq , Sept. 29 . 1719 , between 9 and at Night . The Prosecutor being in a Coach in Pall-Mall , the Prisoner cut the Back of the Coach , and snatch 'd off the Wig , the Jury found him guilty Capitally , but he was afterwards Repriev 'd , and order 'd for Transportation . See his Tryal in the SESSIONS-PAPER for October 1719 . Prisoner . As for the Pistol and Powder , I can give a good Account how I came by them . I was Cook of a Ship , that was just come from New-England , in Company with another Ship , and our Captain invited the other Captain on board our Ship , and that Captain brought his Cook with him ; and this Cook was more expert than I , in taking , and telling Stories and singing a Song , and besides , he could dance , and tumble , and play twenty Tricks to make Diversion ; and your Captains , you know loe to have their Frolicks when they are at Sea . So that this Captain set great Store by this Cook , and this Cook took a great liking to me , and say he , Let 's take some Cartridges of Powder , and make Wildfire to run about the Streets , for the Glory of God , that we are come safe to old England ; and so I came by this Powder , sweet Jesus Almighty knows it to be true . And as for the Pistol , this Cook was an , Flannovernia and a loyal Soul he was to his Majesty , and so he gave me this Pistol , and we drunk our Sovereign Lord King George 's Health , and at every Glass we fir 'd off a Pistol in honour of the Royal Family ; and the Lord above knows , that this is the whole truth of the Matter , and that I had this Pistol on no other Account than to shew my Loyalty . Court . What time was this ? Prisoner . The same Day that I was taken too . Court . Where was the Ship ? Prisoner . At Limehouse . Court . And how came you to Angel-Court . Prisoner . God knows that , for I was elevated , and ca n't give a particular Account ; only I remember we came from on board about 4 in the Afternoon , and this Cook row 'd us a-shore with the wrong Ends of the Oars ; and I believe he had some relations that liv 'd about Angel-Court , and so I might bear him Company ; and tho ' I had a Pistol and Powder , I had no Ball . Court . But it seems you had small Pebbles . How came you by them ? Prisoner . Pebbles ? Why I remember we were heaving Ballast the Day before , and the Cook and I threw many a Shovelful of Ballast at one another for Sport , and so I suppose some of it got into my Pocket . I have a great many Captains to speak to my Character , tho ' it happens that none of them are here ; but I am an innocent lame Man , and I further , it is wilful Murder . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 20. Henry Dod , was indicted for stealing a Handkerchief , value 6 d. the Property of John Hughs June 27 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 21.

On Tuesday night the 25th of June , I was with the Society of London Scholars ( Bell-Ringers ) at the Cock and Lion , in St. Michael's-Alley , Cornhill , where I stay 'd till one in the Morning ; and then I and a Weaver , went away together , we parted at Bishopsgate , and I turn 'd down Hounditch . My Business requiring me to be up at 3 in the Morning , and I seeing a Light at the George Alehouse , I thought it would be better to fit up there , than to go to bed for an Hour or two , and so I went in , and call 'd for a Mug of Ale , and afterwards for a Quartern of Brandy , and sung a Song or two . The Prisoner and her Husband and another Man and Woman were sitting together , and when I had paid my reckoning and was going , the Prisoner 's Husband ask 'd me , if I would not drink with them ? Yes , I said , I am not Charish . I staid till 2 Tankards were brought in , and then I paid 6 d. which was more than my sha e came to ; they saw which Pocket I put my Money into , and if they had seen my Watch too , I might have lost that . I went out and stood to make water , when in a minute , I felt the Prisoner 's Hand in my Pocket , I catch 'd hold of her wrist , and heard the Money chink in her Hand , but before I could get it from her , she had shifted it to the other Woman who stood close to her . The Prisoner was not out of my Hands , till I gave her to the Watch , but the other Woman went off directly . I had half a Guinea , 6s . 6d . and some Copper in my Pocket , all which was then taken from me . + The Poulterer , who 3 or 4 Years ago , walk 'd 100 Miles in Moorfields in 27 Hours . Prisoner .

Upon my Oath I went in with no Woman but alone . Prisoner . He went with her to one end of the Table , and sing 'd a very fine Song to please Ladies , and then he brought her to us and sing 'd another Song , and then he paid 6 d. and went out with her ; and. , like a Jack-Aks as I was , went out to do what no Body could do for me , and the other Woman stumbled against me , and went away ; and so he took me for her , and said , I had pick 'd his Pocket . The Jury acquitted her . 22. Stephen Partridge , was indicted for privately stealing 27 Yards of superfine Cloth , the Goods of William Rawlins , in his Shop , May 23 . William Rawlins . The Cloth was lost out of my Shop Window , ( the Three-Kings on Ludgate-Hill ) between 4 and 7 in the Afternoon . I advertis 'd it , and thereby heard that 5 Yards and a Quarter was at Samuel Laurenson 's ( a Scourer ) Laurenson said he had it from Michael Elston , and Elston from the Prisoner and Tom Kempson . Thomas Kempson . I and the Prisoner met in the Old-Bailey , and went to drink a Dram at Dson 's , and there he told me , he knew of a Piece of Cloth , at the Corner of the Old-Bailey , he stood at Ludgate to watch , and as we had agreed , he cry 'd , Tommy , when the Coast was clear ; upon hearing the Watch-word , I took the Cloth on my Shoulder , and went with it to Mrs. Wincox 's in the Old-Bailey ; but she would not let me leave it there , and so I carry 'd it to the Sheeppens in Smithfield , and watch 'd it till he brought a Bag , and then we carry 'd it to Mrs. Elston 's , and she bid us leave it till Morning , which we did , and when we came again , it was cut in several Pieces . Her Husband said , it was worth 15 or 16 s. a Yard , and he would give us 8 s. a Yard for it , and we agreed , and he gave us 2 Guineas cown , which the Prisoner and I divided equally betwixt us . And the Prisoner went several time , afterwards and brought me 3 or 4 s. at a time , till I had receiv 'd 15 or 16s for the Remainder of my Share . Sam Lawrenson . Michael Elston brought me 5 Yards , and a Quarter of this Cloth to be press 'd and shrunk ; he said it was to make a Suit for a Customer ( for he 's a Taylor by Trade ) I had with him before then .

I had it from Mrs. Whitehead to make a Suit for her Husband , who is a Watchmaker . I did not buy it . Prosecutor . We preferr 'd a Bill in the Morning against Mrs. Whitehead , but it was not found .

She said she had brought some Cloth to make Husband a Suit , and so she deliver 'd it to me . She left another Remnant to be laid by her , and on the Tuesday following the Prisoner fetched it away again . I gave her no Money for any of the Cloth , only my Husband lent her 2 is .

Mr. Manfield . On the 7th of June , about 11 at Night , I came from the Spaw by Islington , and crossing the Fields came into the Road to St. John's-street , near the Barley-Mow . I here I was attack 'd by 3 Men ; one collar 'd me , and another struck me on the Head with something that cut me into ' my Hat and Wig . They demanded my Money ; I put my Hand in one Pocket and gave them what I had there , but how much I can not be certain . They took my Hat and Cane ; but upon my a king for my Cane again , they return 'd it to me . I believe they left me sooner than they wou 'd have done for fear of the Drovers , who come that Road on Thursday Nights . It was dark , and I can not swear to either of the Prisoners . I heard of them afterwards by means of an Advertisement in a News-Paper . Thomas Kempson . I went to see the Races at Hampstead , and there I met the Prisoners ; from thence we went to the Shop on Sn-Hill , where we had 2 or 3 Pints of Beer , and staid till between 9 and 10 . Then says Tanner , I must have Money to fetch me . out of Pawn . God damn your , let 's go out all together ; for he had stole a Haymaker 's Coat in the Fields , and I had pawn 'd it for him ; so we agreed , and went to the Barley-Mow and sit upon the Bench . When we had waited about half an Hour , a Man ( about the Size of the Prosecutor ) came by . I collar 'd him with one Hand , and held a Pistol in the other . Tanner stood by with a Knife ; and Cecil , with another Knife , struck the Gentleman on the Head . Tanner took his Hat , Cane , and Money ; I think there was 10 s. The Gentleman said we had used him ill , and cut his Nose , and desired us to return his Cane , which we did . Then we went to the Haycocks near Hoxton , and lay till Morning , when Tanner looking on the Hat said , God damn you , how came this Cut ? Why , says Cecil , I did it . God damn you , says Tanner again , how could you be so barbarous ? We not thinking it proper to pawn the Hat , because of the Cut , I gave them a Shilling a-piece and took the Hat to myself ; and so Tanner went to fetch his grey Coat out of Pawn ( he has it on now ) and I went home ; but we had agreed to meet again at the White Bear in Old-street Square to play at Skittles . When I came to them , Tanner had won all Cecil 's Money , and then he [ Tanner ] said he must go home to his Wife , for she had no Money , and he would come to us again . But not meeting us according to his Promise , I fear 'd he was going to make himself an Evidence ; and so , to be before-hand with him , I surrender 'd myself directly to Mr. Cathery , the Constable , and he advertised the Robbery in the News . I became acquainted with the Prisoners at Whitehead 's , and here is a Witness that saw us together the Day the Robbery was done . John Overy . I and Kempson took a Walk on Thursday to see the Hampstead Horse-races . I parted with him on the Heath , and taking a Turn I met him again , and two Men with him , who , by the Glimpse I had of them , I believe were the Prisoners , and especially for next Morning I went to see my S Law Mrs. Whitehead , who at Mr. Jackson 's in Brick-lane , in and there I found Kempson , and I saw lurking about the Door , and says I to Kempson , There 's a young Man wants you , I suppose . Why do you think so ? says he . Because ( I said ) I think I saw him with you at the Races . Well , says Kempson , let him walk . But at last Kempson went down to him , and my Sister 's Husband coming to the Door , we all agreed to go to the Races again , so we went together about 2 a Clock , and by the Way they began some Discourse about a Robbery and a Hat , and Skickle and I walking a little before , he opened the Secret to me . We robb 'd a Gentleman , says he , last Night , of a Hat and 10 s. and I struck him on the Head with a Knife . Court . 'T is very odd that a Man should give such an Account of himself to one that was a Stranger to him . - But you made no Discovery of this Secret . Overy . No . But Kempson did , and I and Whitehead assisted to take the Prisoners . John Cathery , Constable . Kempson told me , that he and the Prisoners had robb 'd a Man by the Barley-Mow , of a Hat , a Came a Watch-Key , and 10s . and he told me where to find the Prisoners . We took them both on Sunday Night , Tanner in Cow-lane , and Cecil in Fleet-lane , in a House that Whitehead kept to harbour Thieves . Whitehead had other Lodgings in Brick-lane for the same Use . This Hat and Watch Key were given by Whitehead in Newgate . Prosecutor . This is the Hat I lost , and this is my Watch-Key ; it being broke had put it in my Pocket , and gave it the Street-Robbers with my Money . Cecil . Kempson met me on Sunday , and persuaded me to go and drink with him , and then he carried me to Whitehead 's , and gave Notice to the Constable , who came and took me . The Prisoners called a considerable Number of Witnesses ( who made a good Appearance ) in their Behalf ; they gave the Prisoners the Characters of honest , industrious , young Men , and the Jury acquitted them . 27. Dubartus Stiff , was indicted for the Murder of John Scot , by maticiously giving him , with a Knife , one mortal Wound on the left Side of the Belly , between the short Ribs , of the Length of 6 Inches , and Depth of 5 Inches , on the 14th of May , of which he languished till the next Day , and then died . He was a 2d time indicted on the Statute of Stabbing , for killing John Scot in the Fury of his Mind , the said John not having any Weapon drawn , nor having first struck the said Dubartus . He was a 3d time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the Murder of the said John Scot . Sarah Stockdon . On Whitsun Monday at Night , between 9 and 10 , the Deceased and I were going along Piccadilly , by the Earl of Sunderland 's Wall ; three Men of our Acquaintance , Samuel Dupny , James Porter , and Edward Austin , were walking just before us . As we past by the Prisoner and another , who were leaning against a Post , the Prisoner said to the Deceased , Make haste home , young Man , or your Master will be angry , and wo n't give you another Holiday to Morrow . The Deceased answered , Suppose I have no Master , and what then ? I was afraid of a Quarrel , and desired the Deceased to go along and not mind them . But he said , As I affront nobody , I wo n't take an Affront from anybody , and I 'll revenge my own Cause . This occasioned more Words on both Sides , and I still urged the Deceased to go , but he bid me not be afraid , for he would do no Hurt . By this Time our three Friends were gone a pretty Way forward , but to prevent Mischief I called to them . Mr. Austin cry 'd Hoy ! and the Deceased cry 'd Hoy to him again , and said to the Prisoner , Honesty , I was not alone ; I have got Company . Our Company came back , and Mr. Porter asked what was the Matter ? I told him the Prisoner had affronted the Deceased , and he resented it . Upon this some angry Words past between them , and the Prisoner struck Porter in the Face , and the other Man struck the Deceased , and so they fell to fighting . In the Scuffle , the Deceased and the other Man were got on the other Side of the Way . The Prisoner and Porter fell together , and when they got up the Prisoner went off , and Porter staid to look for his Hat and Wig , but I had taken them up . Then the Deceased called to Porter , and said , Jemmy , Jemmy , I am stabb 'd . I went over and took hold of him , and he said , That Man has stabb 'd me . He did not name what Man , but the Prisoner was nearest him , for the other Man was gone . I called to our Acquaintance ; the Prisoner ran ; I cry 'd Stop him , and they pursued him down Duke-street . I carried the Deceased to an Apothecary 's Shop just by ; the Apothecary 's young Man advised me to go to Mr. Stevens the Surgeon , and coming out , I met a Croud with the Prisoner . - He lived but 21 Hours afterwards . He was Cook ( and some Relation ) to Mr. Powell at the Gloucester-Head Tavern in Pall-Mall . Prisoner . Did you see me strike the Deceased ? S. S. No . Prisoner . Or strike Mr. Porter ? S. S. Yes . There was no Blow given till Mr. Porter came up , and then you struck him first , and so it began . Prisoner . On which side of the Way did the Quarrel begin ? S. The same side as my Lord Sunderland 's is . Pris . Was it dark ? S. No , not quite dark ; I could see well enough , it was about the middle of May , between 9 and 10 in the Evening . Samuel Dupny . We were 100 Yards before the Deceas 'd when he cry 'd , Hoy ! to us , and a little Boy told us that two Men were a quarrelling with one of our Company . We went back ; Mr. Porter said to the Prisoner and the other , ( whose Name as I have heard is William Brown ) I hope you wo n't both be a one Man . Yes , but we will , said the Prisoner , and you too , you Dog . And with that he struck Porter on the Nose and made it bleed ; they closed ; Porter flung him and fell with him ; the Prisoner and Brown at that time were at it over the Way , but they parted , and Brown went about his Business . When Porter and the Prisoner got up , Porter looked about for his Hat and Wig , and the Prisoner went from him , and had been gone but a very little while before the Deceased cried out , Jemmy , I 'm stab 'd ! I 'm stuck ! I 'm dead Man ! We cross 'd the Way , and I saw the Prisoner standing within five Yards of the Deceased , and fronting ; the Deceased pointed to the Prisoner and said , That Man has Stab 'd me . Upon hearing that , the Prisoner began to run , and Sarah Stockton cry 'd out Stop him . Court . Are you sure that Brown was not there when the Deceased said he was Stab 'd ? S.D . Yes ; for before he said so , I saw Brown a hundred Yards off - We pursued the Prisoner , and he was stopt by a Chairman and a Gentleman ; and as we were carrying him to the Roundhouse I said , You Rogue , you have kill 'd the Lad ; and he answer 'd , I should not care if I had served you the same . When he came into the Roundhouse I said , There 's your Lodging ; and his Answer was , I did it , and dropt the Knife - Lock me up . J. Porter . The Deceased was at Sunderland-Gate , and we were as far before him as the Plumber 's against St. James 's Church when he cry 'd , Hoy ! A Boy told us two Men were going to beat him ; we stept back , and I said Sure you two wo n't beat one ? The Prisoner answer 'd , Yes , and you too , ye Dog ; and so he fell upon me , and set my Nose a bleeding . We fought ; I threw him , and fell myself : I got up , and while I was looking for my Hat and Wig the Prisoner was gone , but I did not see which Way he went - The Deceased call 'd out , Jemmy , I am Stab 'd . I went over , the Prisoner stood facing the Deceased as far from him as I am now from the Prisoner , and the Deceased said , That Rogue has kill 'd me . Upon that the Prisoner began to run , and I followed him and came so near him that he made a Push at me and brush 'd my Coat : I was afraid of his Knife , or I could ha ve closed him then ; but I kept on pursuing and crying Stop Thief till he was taken . Edward Austin having confirmed the former part of the Depositions of Dupuy and Porter , proceeded thus : I saw the Prisoner push twice at Porter with a Knife , once in Piccadilly , and once in Duke-Street . Court . Did you see the Knife in his Hand ? E. A Yes ; for it was Moon-light . Prisoner . What sort of a Knife ? E. A A Penknife with a pretty broad Handle [ blade ] broader than I have usually seen a Penknife . Court . How far was the Prisoner from the Deceased when the Deceased cry 'd out , He was Stab 'd ? E. A . He might be about 20 or 30 Yards when I saw him ; for when the Deceased call 'd out , I was looking for Mr. Porter 's Hat on the other side of the Way . Court . Did the Deceased point to any Body when he said that Man ? E. A . Not that I saw ; but I thought he meant the Prisoner , because the Prisoner begun to run , and Brown was then standing near the Centry-box by the dead Wall on t'other side of the Way . Edward Coker . I stopt the Prisoner in Duke-Street as he was running towards German-Street : He said , Pray let me go , 't is only a Quarrel . No , says I , not till the Company comes up ; for they were then about 20 Yards off . When they came , they said he had killed a Man , to which he made no Answer . When we brought him to the Roundhouse some Body said to him , You have Stuck the Man , where 's the Knife ? he said , I do n't know , I have thrown it away . William Stead . I heard the same : And another said , Why was you such a Villain to Sab him ? and he answered , I would have got off if I could , but go which Way I would they were after me : I had no Malice to the Man , for I never saw him with my Eyes before ; but if I have killed him I am sorry for it , and must suffer for it : There must be Blood for Blood . Mr. Steven 's , Surgeon . The Deceased had two Wounds , one was a Stab about two Inches long , but the other was cut up five or six Inches in drawing the Knife out . The Grissel between the Ribs was divided in two Places , the Caul hung out of one , and part of the Guts , as big as my Fist , out of the other : I reduced them . Next Morning , I found he had the Hick-up , from whence I concluded that his Stomach was wounded , and that he would certainly die . I then ask 'd him who struck first ; and he answer 'd , I can not be certain , the Quarrel was very sudden , and I might strike first . He died that Day , and upon opening him I found the lower side of his Liver was wounded , and that the Knife had past into the Cavity of the Stomach . Edward Fox . My Master is an Apothecary , and lives in Piccadilly , against my Lord Sunderland 's . I heard a great Noise and opened the Door , and saw two Men running a-cross the Way towards me ; the foremost , ( who I suppose was the Prisoner ) was in a light Coat , and the other , ( who was the Deceased ) was in a dark Coat . I saw the foremost turn short and strike the Deceased in the Side , but I saw no Knife : The Deceased presently cry 'd , Jemmy , Jemmy , I am Stuck . Sarah Stockton came over the Way , and brought the Deceased into our Shop ; a Puddle of Blood ran from his Side , and I advised her to take him to Mr. Stevens the Surgeon , and so she led him him out ; my Master followed them , and brought home this broad Clasp-penknife ; but where it was found , or who gave it him , I can not tell , nor would the Deceased own it ; but it was a little bloody . Mr.Powell . The Deceased was my Servant and Nephew , I went to see him abou an Hour before his Death , and ask 'd himf he knew me ; he said , Yes . You are my Uncle . I ask 'd him if he thought he should die ; he answered Yes . Then I ask 'd him who was the Aggressor ; and he said , I never saw the Man in my Life before that Night he Stab 'd me , and then I was not engaged with him but with the other : I neither struck him , nor he me , till I received these two Wounds . - Here is his Coat , here is his Waistcoat , and here is his Shirt . These long Cuts on the left Side were made when he received those Wounds . Prisoner . As I was standing with William Brown , the Deceased and a young Woman came by , and it being Holiday Time , I said , So , young Man , make haste home , or your Master wo n't let you have another Holiday . Sirrah , says he , I 'll let you know that I have no Master ; and with that he hip 'd to his Company before , and they came back , and all fell upon me and knock 'd me down . I got up again and ran away , but they followed me ; and if I did this thing it is more than I know ; for by the Blows and Bruise I received I was so disordered , that I was not then sensible of what I did , and am not able to give any Account of it now . Court . Fox swears that one like you ran cross the Way , and being pursued by the Deceased , turn 'd short and gave him a Blow . Pris . He perhaps may tell whereabout it was that I turn 'd and made a Blow ( if I did do so ) but I can not . Fox . It was on this hither Side of my Master 's House , just by the Kennel . Thomas Dobney . I have known the Prisoner 13 Years ; he is a Joyner and Carpenter by Trade , and a civil , honest , good-natured , careful young Man . I live in Piccadilly overagainst his Father 's ; the Night the Misfortune happened , he went from my House with William Brown ( who is now at Sea . ) Brown returned to my House the same Night very much beaten , and with his Clothes torn ; but the Prisoner was taken up and sent next Day to Newgate . I went thither to see him , and there was James Porter , one of the Witnesses against him . Mr. Johnson in Newgate , ( who is a Friend to the Prisoner 's Father ) called me down to hear what Porter would say ; and Porter said thus : When the Deceased hip 'd we went back , and ask 'd what was the Matter , and the Deceased said , These Fellows are a going to lick me ; and I said , No sure , not two to one ; and then I do n't know which struck first , but I kick 'd up the Prisoner 's Heels , and he fell upon his Head . I am sure it must he broke ; for you might have heard the Sound of the Fall 20 Yards off . Now I query , whether a Person after such a Fall could have the proper Use of his Senses . Susan Green . I heard a Noise , and going to the Door , I saw a Man in a whitish Coat , but without Hat or Wig , run down Duke-Street ; and I heard him say , Four to one ! and three Men followed him , and cry 'd , Stop Thief . Court . His running down Duke-Street was after the Deceased was wounded . Solomon Price . The Prisoner is a very sober , industrious young Man , I never saw him in Liquor , nor heard him swear an Oath , nor never knew him to be in any Riot or Quarrel . Seven or eight more Witnesses gave him a good Character . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 28.

The Prisoners and I , and Harry Cole stole these Pipes and Cocks about 2 o'Clock on Whitsunday Morning . Fish put us upon it ; for he said he had been out all Night , and could tell us of a rare Chance . We did one Parcel till 9 at Night , and then carried it to Will .

Then we went about Eleven the same Night , and got as much more , and hid it in a Dunghill by the Ditch-side ; but it was found by a Boy who went there to ease himself , and so the Prosecutor came to hear of it , and we were taken the next Friday Morning by a Watchman , as we came out of Brown-low-Street with some Lead we had stole ; and so I was made an Evidence .

Thomas Chambers was indicted for privately stealing a stained Cambrick Handkerchief , value 1 s. 6 d. from the Person of Barwell Smith , Esq ; May 13 Mr. Smith . On Sunday in the Afternoon , as I was walking in Grays-Inn-Walks , there was an Outcry of several that had their Pockets pick 'd , and going from thence to the Coffee-house , I there missed my Handkerchief . I presently step 'd back , and bid the Door-keeper of the Walks let me know if he saw any suspicious Persons loitering about there : A Boy came and told me , that he saw two Men pick a Gentleman 's Pocket in the dark Passage by the Bookseller 's Shop . I went to the Passage , took hold of the Prisoner , and saw him throw down a silk Handkerchief . Sir , says I , you must go with me . Sir , says he , I am a Gentleman ; what d 'ye mean ? I could find no Constable , and so I took him to my own House ; he fell on his Knees , and made many Protestations of his Innocence , but upon searching him , I found my Handkerchief in his Bosom . Then he said , he was no Pick-pocket himself , but was only retain 'd by them , and had 1 s. 6 d. a Day to attend on them , and take what they stole . Rich . Smith . When my Father had brought the Prisoner home , the Prisoner kneel 'd down and call 'd Christ to witness that he never pick 'd a Pocket in all his Life , tho ' at the same time I saw him pull a Handkerchief out of his Pocket and put it into his Bosom ; but when he found that my Father was resolved to search him thoroughly , he took it out of his Bosom again , and gave it to my Father , who own 'd it ; and then the Prisoner said , If it 's your 's , I can expect no Mercy . Holt Crow ; Constable . I heard the Prisoner say that he took the Handkerchief from another Person , who allow 'd him 9 s. a Week for receiving Handkerchiefs . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 32. Alexander Watson was indicted for privately stealing ( with James Maddox , not yet taken ) a silver Dish , value 14 l. the Property of Charles Churchill , Esq ; in the Shop of Paul Crispin , Jan. 5 . And , 33. William Howard for receiving the same , knowing it to be stolen . Paul Crispin . What I have to tha ith thith , I lotht a thilver Dith belonging to Brigadier Churchill , out of my Grate in Compton-Thtreet , the Corner of Greek-Thtreet , but I ca n't tell when , becauth it ish impothible , and I never mitht it till the 3d of January , when it wath called for . I am a Thilver-Thmith by Trade , and the Dith wath left me to make a Cover to it . When Baker wath taken Prithoner , he akth me if I wath not rob 'd of thuch a Dith , and I thaid , Yeth ; but I never found it again . James Baker . Aleck Watson and Jemmy Maddox , and I , stole the silver Dish out of the Prosecutor 's Window , about 6 at Night . We raised up the Grate , and put a Stick under it to keep it from pinching our Fingers ; and so we drew the Dish out , and I carried it to Mrs. Walker 's , a Brandy-shop in Cross-Lane , near Long-Acre , and she kept it for us all Night . Next Day , I and Watson , and Mattox , went with the Dish to James [ William ] Howard 's , and he and Mattox went to sell it at an Ale-house ( I think it was the Ship ) in the Old-Bailey . I saw them go in with it , and I stood at the Door to watch , for fear they should run away with the Money . They brought me out one Guinea , and then they went in again and fetch 'd six Guineas more , and so went to Mr. Rodes 's , at the Goat and Leak in White-horse-Alley . Howard Where did we go first ? Baker . To The King 's Head , the Backside of the Old-Bailey , and there we ran up a Score Then we went to the Ship Alehouse . I stay 'd at the Old-Bailey - [ Sessions house ] Gate , leaning against a Post for half an Hour , and then you came out and brought a Guinea . Then we went and bought half a Goos , and carried it to Rodes 's , where we stay 'd two or three Hours , and drank Cherry-Beer and Brandy ; and then went again to the King's-Head , and you and Mattox went to the Ship again , and brought six Guineas more . Then we took Coach and went to Mrs. Walker 's in Cross-Lane , who had trusted us with Liquor till the Dish was sold , and she bought two Fowls and Bacon for us : There we divided the Money ; we three had two Guineas a-piece , you had about 6 s. out of the odd Guinea , and the rest of it we spent in eating the Goose , and one thing or another . I had eight or nine and twenty Shillings left after I had paid Mrs. Walker . Watson and I lay together in St. Giles 's , and we bought some new Clothes , and made a Noise about the Seven Dials , and Tom Kelly sent a Letter and said he would hang me ; and so to be before-hand with him , I surrender 'd myself , and gave my Information against him and the Prisoners . Watson . Where did you meet me in the Morning ? Baker . At Buck 's Brandy shop in St. Giles 's , and from thence we went to Walker 's in Cross-Lane , and about six at Night we went out a thieing . Watson . Who took the Dish ? Baker . I did ; but we all three help 'd up the Grate . Watson . Who carried the Dish to Walker 's ? Baker . I did ; but I gave it first to Mattox ; and then I took it from him again , and carried it under my Arm . Watson . When was this ? Baker . I ca n't write nor read , but as near as I can guess , it was about the 5th of January . When we came to Howard with the Dish , Mrs. Walker lent him her Apron to hide it , but he thought that would not do , and so he went up into hisfs own Room , and brought down a Bag and put it in that , and so he carried it to the Ship . Howard Was you in my Room ? Baker No , we came in a C to Clerkenwell Gen , and sent for you to the Horn Alehouse , and you came over to us , and then you went and fetch 'd the Bag , and you and Mattox went out to sell the Dish , and I and Watson , and Walker , stay 'd there till you came back and brought us a Guinea . Court . Stay 'd where ? Baker . At the Alehouse at Clerkenwell-Green . Court . Why you swore just now , that you stood leaning against a Post at the Old-Bailey-Gate , Gate , while they went in and brought out a Guinea ; that you went thence to Rode 's and eat part of a Goose : that you went back again to the Old-Bailey , where you waited till they brought out the six Guineas , and that then you went to the King 's Head . Baker . No ; we stay 'd at Clerkenwell because we had not Money to discharge the Reckoning till they brought the Guinea , and then we went to Rodes 's , and from Rodes 's they went for the six Guineas , and so to the King's-Head Court . You swore you went first to the King's-Head , then to the Old-Bailey , where you stood watching till they brought the Guinea ; and you gave this Reason for your watching , that you were afraid they would run away with the Money . And now you swear that you did not watch at the Old-Bailey , but stay 'd at Clerkenwell-Green till they brought the Guinea ; and you give a Reason for that too , you had no Money to pay the Reckoning . Catherine Walker . Mattox , Watson and Baker came into my House together towards the Evening , about half a Year ago , and called for Liquor . Mattox had a deep silver Dish under his Arm . Court . Baker swore that he carry 'd the Dish . Walker . When they had run up 8 or 9 s. I asked them for the Money ; they said if I would go with them they would pay me , I asked them if they thought I had nothing to do but to tag after their Tails when I was with Child and not well ; they said , I should have a Coach , and so a Coach was called , and we drove to the Horn at Clerkenwell-Green . They had no Money to discharge the Coach , and so I paid 1 s. 6 d. for them . Mattox went from the Alehouse and fetch 'd a young Man ( I think his Name is Howard ) who drank once , and then he and Mattox went out together , and when they return 'd Mattox chang 'd a Guinea , and paid for four Pints of Ale that we had had . They insisted upon my Eating something , and so we went to another House , and had a Quarter of a Goose . Court . How long was it after they brought the Dish , before you went with them ? C. Walker . Some Hours . Court . Are you sure it was that Night ? C. Walker . Yes . Court . Baker swears it was the next Day . Howard . At what time was it that you eat part of the Goose ? C. Walker . I ca n't tell the Hour , but it was at Supper late at Night , and then from thence we all , but Howard , went home in a Coach ; they sat me down at my Door , and then they discharged the Coach . Howard . Baker swore that we went to the Kings's-Head after we had eat the Goose ; did you see me bring the Money , or have the Dish ? C. Walker . No ; Mattox brought the Money , and it was he that brought the Dish to my House . Howard . Baker charged Walker with the Dish . Baker . That was only for keeping it all Night . Court . She swears you took the Dish with you the same Night . Baker . No it was next Morning . Howard . Was not she taken up about the Dish ? Baker . Yes . Howard . How came she to be discharged ? Baker . Because she own 'd the Dish and deliver 'd it . Howard . Watson was discharged of this Dish last Sessions . Baker . Yes ; but he was not indicted because the Prosecutor was not here . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 34 , 35. Thomas Kelly , and Laurence Grace , were indicted for assaulting ( with Sam Goodwin * , not yet taken ) Edward Owen , on the Highway putting him in Fear , and taking from him , a Gold Ring , value 5 s. a Pair of Bathmetal Studs , and two Guineas , Feb. 21 . * Sam Goodwin and Charles Mascall were Evidences against John Achers , John Welton , and William Booth , for robbing Richard Harvey in December last . See the Trial in the Sessions Paper , Numb . 11. p. 44 . Mr. Owen . On the 21st of February , about 12 at Night , in Bedford-Street , Covent Garden , four Men jostled me up against a Door , and swore if I made the least Noise or Resistance , they would shoot me thro ' the Head . I made no Resistance , nor indeed could I make any , for two of them held my Arms , one Collar 'd me , and held something to me , which I suppose was a Pistol . The fourth riffled my Pockets of a Gold Ring , a pair of Bath-metal Studs , and two Guineas It was so dark I could not see their Faces so as to know them , and therefore can not swear to the Prisoners . I heard one or both of the Guineas they took from me fall , and one of the Men stoop 'd , but I do n't know whether they found 'em or not . Kelly . What did you lose two Guineas ? Mr. Owen . Yes ; I had two Guineas when I was in Golden-Square , which was but a little before . Kelly . May be you fell down by the way , and so lost 'em . James Baker . The Prisoner and I lodged together with Sam Quan + , who was hang 'd in the Country for a Robbery about three Months ago . Sm Goodman was with us at Quan 's , and about 11 at Night we went to see him home . We met the Prosecutor in one of the Streets in Covent Garden , where the Mercers live ; Goodman hit him on the Shoulder , and bid him stand , and Kelly took two Guineas out of his Pocket , and drop 'd them both on the Stones , I stoop 'd and found one , but we lost t'other , for another Gentleman was coming by , and some Chairmen stood over the way , and saw us rob , so that we were forced to make off - Sam Goodman took a Gold Wire Ring off the Prosecutor 's Finger . * Quan and Conway were try 'd in London , for Robbing Job Nutton , in January 1731-2 , but were acquitted . See the SESSIONS-PAPER for last Year , Numb . II . Part II . pag . 58 . Court . Off his Finger , are you sure ? Baker . We all reckon 'd so , because it was a Ring , but we did not see where he took it from . He took a pair of Brass Studs to ; as we were going away Kelly cut the Gentleman over the Eye , with the butt End of a Whip . Kelly . What time o ' Night did we come into your Company ? Baker . We all three lay at Quan 's , and eat and drank together , and about 7 or 8 at Night , we went to Catharine Walker 's in Cross-Lane by Long-Acre , where we met with Goodman , and we drank 3 half Pints of Gin , but we had no Money , and so I pawn 'd my Buckles for 6 d then we all four went back to Quan 's , and stay 'd till between 10 and 11 , and then we went to see Goodman home , and so committed the Robbery . Kelly . You swore before Alderman Brocas , that the Gentleman was robb 'd of 2 Guineas and a Watch , but now you know nothing of the Watch . Baker . No , I said I believ 'd Goodman took his Watch , and we three said so that Night at Quan 's House , and you your self spoke of it first , but next Day we heard it was no such thing . We thought so because Goodman pick 'd the Gentleman 's Pocket . Kelly . You said just now , that it was I that pick 'd his Pocket . Baker Yes , you was fumbling about it , but Goodman push 'd you away , and did it himself , and as he went to Sea the next Day , we thought he had snk the Watch . Kelly . But you swore that he took a Watch ? Court . Did you swear it positively ? Baker . No , I said as I say now , that I believ 'd he took a Watch . Kelly . Can you tell your Story over again ? Baker . Yes , Goodman took the Gentleman by the Shoulder , and bid him stand , then Kelly put his Hand in his Pocket , and riffled him , and drop 'd the Gold , and I pick 'd up one Guinea . Kelly . Just now you said Goodman pick 'd his Pocket . Baker . You and Goodman both riffl 'd him , after we all four had push 'd him up against a Door , and kept him fast , and when he was robb 'd , Kelly struck him with a Whip , and made the Blood run down his Cheek . Mr. Owen When they had riffled me they drew me from the Door , toward the Kennel , and one of them gave me a stroke over the the right Eye , I thought it was done with a Stick . I was laid up for 6 Weeks , and had two Surgeons to attend me here 's the Scar to be seen . Kelly . How long was it after the Robbery before you saw the Gentleman again ? Baker . He was out of Town last Sessions , and I did not see him till this Sessions . Kelly . It 's strange when you saw him but once by Night that you should know him again , half a Year afterwards ? Baker . It was a Moon shiny Night Mr. Owen . It was dark where I stood ; but the Moon was up . Kelly . What Clothes had the Gentleman on ? Baker . I think they were dark Colour , but I ca n't tell justly , because we were all in a Surprize ; for we were pursu 'd in a Minute by the Chairmen and Watchmen , and I ran across Covent Garden , and so directly to Quan 's ; and Kelly and I had 2 or 3 Words , and he said , You Dog I have a good mind to hang you , and so I went and surrender 'd myself , and inform 'd against him . Mr. Owen . I called the Watch , but whether it was before or after the Blow , I can not tell , and immediately the Street was full of People - My Cloaths were a Chocolate Colour . - I saw Baker one Day this Week at Hicks's-Hall , and he said he knew me . Cath . Walker . The Prisoners and Baker have used my Shop , but it was but seldom ; I remember they were there in February last , and had two half Pints of Gin , and Baker said , I must take his Buckles or go without my Money . Court . Was Goodman with them then ? Cath . Walker . He might be there , but I do n't know him by Name . L. Grace . Baker swore positively to the Watch before Alderman Brocas , and we were taken up last Sessions , but nothing appearing against us , we were acquitted and turn 'd out of Court , and Baker and one of the Thief-Catchers stood by at the same Time ; but the Thief-Catchers had been 6 l. out of Pocket , and so they got us taken up again the next Day . T. Kelly . I am a Shoemaker by Trade , but Business being dead , I set up a Cobler 's Stall in St. Alban's-Street , Picadilly . Baker would sometimes come and sit upon my Stall , and so we grew acquainted . - He has been in Bridewell , and cast for Transportation - Grace and I met him in St. Giles 's a few Days before we were taken up . He had a Woman with him , but what she is for her Body I do n't know . He asked us to drink a Quartern of Gin ; and two Days afterwards this Woman came to a House in St. John's-street , where Grace and I were together , and she called him out , and he went with her . I would have fetch 'd him away , but he said he would stay with her all Night , and so he did ; and I staid in the same House , and the next Morning I made the best of my Offence home to my 'Biding ; and the Day after I met him again in St. Giles 's , and going into Drury-Lane , we were both taken by Baker , and the Thief-catchers Atkins , and Adley . Atkins has made it his whole Business for 4 or 5 Years to take Mens Lives away . Jacob Moliere . Kelly has lodged in my House a whole Twelvemonth , till the Time he was taken up ; he kept good Hours , and had an honest Character - I am fourscore and sixteen Years of Age . Susan Brasby . I spin Cotton for the Tallow-Chandlers ; Kelly was my Neighbour ; I have known him four or five Years , and have heard no Ill of him . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 36 , 37. Joseph Barter and Sarah Barter , were indicted for stealing two Spoons , value 2 d. and a Blue woollen Apron , value 2 d. the Goods of Thomas Marshal , May 2 . Thomas Marshall . I have several Lodgers , the Prisoners lodged with me three Quarters of a Year .

Acquitted . 38 , 39 , Edward Scot , and Joshua Hall , were indicted for stealing 200 weight of Rope , value 20 s. the Goods of Richard Baker the Elder the Elder , and Richard Baker the Younger the Younger , May 19 . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 40. Thomas Richards , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of John Jacobs , and stealing 50 s. June 27 , in the Night . John Jacobs . I keep a little Brandy-shop in Chick-lane ; between 1 and 2 a Clock last Tuesday Morning I heard somebody call Jacobs ! Jacobs ! your House is broke open ! I got up and found the Till of my Shop broke ; the Lock and Brass Tobacco-Box that my Money was in lay upon the Counter , but the Money ( 50 s. ) was gone . I went backward and found my Casement , which neither opens nor shuts , was taken off , mash 'd 10 pieces , and thrown under the Window ; there was a Shutter belonging to it , which I had fastened myself over Night with a wooden Bar and Pin and Key ; but I found the Bar had been wrench 'd till the Spring of the Key was broke , and so it was forc 'd open . I found the Prisoner 's Shoes in the Room , and going to the Stable in the Yard , I found him lying there without Shoes , 2 s. hid in the Hay lost . Henry Lane , Watchman . Being at my Stand I heard a Noise of a Window breaking ; I planted my Brother Watch at the Street-door and went backwards , and finding the Window broke open , I called the Prosecutor up : I went in ; the till was open , and the Lock and a Brass Box lying on the Counter . A pair of Shoes lay by the Window , and one said , I know those Shoes and the Owner of them , and he ca n't be far off . We found the Prisoner in the Stable with his Head under the Manger , and without Shoes . He own 'd the Shoes to be his . - The Stable is about 20 Yards from the Window . John Palmer . I live at the upper End of Chick-lane , but being a little in for't , I happened to take up my Lodging at my Neighbour 's Door . I was waked by the Noise of breaking the Window , and going backwards with others , I saw the Shoes under the Window , and swore those were Tom Richards 's Shoes . - These are the Shoes , I know them by this Rent in the Side , and this Sole being cut off , and the Dirt upon the hind Quarters . Court . How came you to take such particular Notice of his Shoes ? Palmer . He lived in the Lane ; I saw him at Jacob 's but the Day before , and he shew 'd me his Shoes because they were so bad , and he would have given me 3 d. for mine , and he used to wear them shod , as you may see plainly by the hind Quarters . The Stable-door had been nail 'd up for some Time , so that there is no way into it but by getting up into the Hay-loft ; so we got up and came down into the Stable , and there he lay in a muck Sweat , without his Shoes ; I burst the Stable-door open with my Backside to get him out , and he own 'd the Shoes . John Keen , Constable . The Prisoner was brought before me without Shoes . I asked where his Shoes were ? and one said , Here . Are these your Shoes ? says I to the Prisoner , and he answer 'd , Yes . James Goodman and William Woodward deposed to the same Effect . Prisoner . I had been drinking at the Prosecutor 's till between 11 and 12 at Night , and then I was so overtaken that I could not find my way out , and so I fell asleep ; two or three pushed me and waked me , and then they carried me into the Stable , and said I had better lye there out of the way ; and I was surprized when they came in the Morning and charged me with breaking the House .

Josiah Reader , Eleanor Maybank , Widow , John Trundle , Miriam Prestidge , Spinster , James Duffield and Mary Pearson , Spinster , were indicted , for that in the 1st of Feb . they came before the Lord Chief Justice Eyre , in the Parish of St. Dunstan 's in the West ; and that then and there the said Josiah Read , in the Name of Jeremiah Scruby ; Eleanor Maybank , in the Name of Mary , the Wife of Jeremiah Scruby ; John Trundle , in the Name of John Bridgeman ; Miriam Prestidge , in the Name of Margaret , the Wife of John Bridgeman ; James Duffield , in the Name of Thomas Robinson ; and Mary Pearson , in the Name of Hannah , the Wife of Thomas Robinson ; together with Christopher Smith , did deceitfully , corruptly , and feloniously make and acknowledge a Fine of one Messuage , one Garden , one Orchard , twelve Acres of Land , and twelve Acres of Pasture , to Thomas Parker and Samuel Lynn , whereby the said Jeremiah Scruby , & c. were supposed to have acknowledged the said Fine , in the Right of the said Parker and Lynn ; whereas the said Scruby , & c. were not privy or consenting to the Acknowledgement of the said Fine . Mr. Hayworth . About the End of last January I received a Letter from Mr. William Brereton , an Attorney in Norfolk , for whom I transact Business here , informing me , that Mr. Christopher Smith of Norfolk had sold an Estate to Thomas Parker , and another to Samuel Lynn ; That to Parker in his own Right , and the other in Right of his Sisters , to which he was Heir at Law , and was to have the Reversion ; and that Mr. Smith was to come to Town to levy the Fine . Two Days afterwards , Christopher Smith and Thomas Griffith came to me , and asked if I had received a Letter from Mr. Brereton about those Estates ; I told them my Instructions were only about the Estate to Parker , and advised Griffith ( who appeared as Smith 's Attorney , and by whom Smith seemed to be influenced ) to draw up the Case of the other Estate , to have the Opinion of Council ; for I thought Lynn 's Purchase not secure except the Sisters joined in it . I wrote to Mr. Brereton , and received his Answer the 16th of February , after which , Smith and Griffith came to me again ; I told them we had agreed that the Sisters and their Husbands should all be conusant of the Fine ; and as the two Estates were in the same Parish , to save the Charge of two Fines they were to join them in one . Griffith agreed to this Fine , and undertook to go next Morning into Essex ( where he said Smith 's Brothers and Sisters lived ) and procure them to come up next Monday : And on Monday in the Afternoon he came and told me , that the Brothers and Sisters were come up , and desired me to get all ready against next Day . It happened my Lord Chief Justice was not then at Leisure , and so we agreed on Wednesday . I went on Wednesday to his Lordship 's Chambers , and in the Evening Griffith came to me there , and said that Mr. Smith and his Brothers and Sisters were all below ; I went down with him , and he shewed me the Prisoners sitting on a Bench under the Arch of Serjeants-Inn : Are these they ? says I ; Yes , says he . I proposed that they should go to the Coffee-house , and be made acquainted with what they came about . It was agreed to , and we all went together into an Inner-Room . Court . Look on the Prisoners and name them . Mr. H. She that stands at this hither Corner of the Bar is Mary Pearson ; the next is Miriam Prestidge , and the other Woman is Ellen Maybank ; Josiah Reader stands by Pearson , and I think he next him is John Trundle . Prisoner 's Council . No , that is not he . Mr. H .. Then I believe Trundle is the Hindermost . P. Coun . But you are not positive which is which Mr. H. The Prisoners were altogether in the Room , and I said to Mr. Smith , Are these your Brothers and Sisters who are to join in the Fine ? he answer 'd , Yes . Have you told them , says I , what they are to do ? he said , Yes ; and that he had paid them the Consideration Money . I ask 'd the three Women if their Brother had paid them that Money , and if they were content to pass the Fine ? they in general answer 'd , Yes . P. Coun . But can you take upon you to say , that they all , or any one in particular , answer 'd , Yes ? Mr. H. I ca n't say that every one in particular answer 'd , that they had received a Consideration ; but Mr. Smith said , he had paid them the Consideration Money ; and the Women said , in general , Yes . I think Prestidge said , that they were all contented . P. Coun . If they only said they were contented to pass the Fine , they might not be apprised of the Iniquiry of the thing . Can you be positive that every one in particular said before she sign 'd , that she had received the Consideration Money ? Mr. H. I ca n't be so particular . I produc 'd a Paper , and wrote the Concord - The Precipe was in Latin , and I read it to them in English - I produc 'd the Instrument at the same time that I ask 'd the Questions , and desired Mr. Smith to write his Name first , which he did , and the others sign 'd after him . P. Coun . It 's laid that one personated one , and another another : Now what particular Person did Josias Reader personate ? Mr. H. I think the Name of Scruby was sign 'd by Reader . Court . Which is Reader ? Mr. H. He that stands behind there . P. Coun . How can you take upon you to swear that Reader , rather than any other Person , subscribed the Name of Scruby ? Mr. H. I believe it was he Court . Do you remember his Act of subscribing ? Mr. H. I asked who was the elder Brother , and as I remember , Reader answer 'd , and wrote first : I believe it was he , but I can not be positive to a Man that I never saw in my Life before . The next Name is Mary Scruby , and I think that was sign 'd by Ellen Maybank , as the Wife of John Scruby ; the third is the Name John Bridegeman , and I think he was personated by John Trundle . P. C. Do you know Trundle ? Mr. H. Yes . P. Coun . But you mistook him at the Bar just now . Mr. H. Then the Name of Margaret Bridgeman was sign 'd by Miriam Prestidge - I believe it was she . P. C. Can you take upon you to swear that it was not Pearson who sign 'd the Name of Margaret Bridgeman ? Mr. H. I believe it was not ; I think Pearson sign 'd last , for as I remember the Name of Thomas Robinson , was sign 'd by James Duffield , and then Mary Pearson sign 'd the Name of Hunnah Robinson . P. C. Then you can not be positive to any of them , you only believe ; but how can you recollect ( even so far as to believe ) which of them particularly sign 'd this or that Name so long ago , when there were six of them together , and you saw them but that once . Mr. H. I had a second View of them before my Ld . C. J. Eyre ; for after they had subscribed , and drank to one another as Brothers and Sisters , I told them they must go up to his Lordship , and be examin 'd again , and I am sure they all six went up . Mr. Brown . This is the Precipe Mr. Hayworth brought on me , sign 'd as it is , and the Caption fill 'd up . P. C. Was any thing done on the Paper at his Lordship 's Chambers ? Mr. Brown . I introduc 'd them and read over in English this individual Paper ( the Precipe ) then I call 'd Christopher Smith , and one answer 'd to the Name , next I call 'd Jeremiah Scruby , and another answer 'd to that Name . P. C. Can you take upon you to say which of the Prisoners at the Bar , answer 'd to the Name of Scruby ? Mr. B. I believe it was Reader , but I can not be positive . Court . Can you recollect the Act of each , and apply it to each ? Mr. B . No ; nor do I remember the Identity of the Persons ; except it be Pretidge , and , I think , I remember her , one of other of them answered to all the Names . I asked them if they were content to levy the Fine of the Premises within mentioned , and they consented . P. Coun . Are you sure they all answered ? Mr. B. I can not say whether they answered or bowed . Then the pretended Husbands withdrew , and the Women staid to be examined apart . His Lordship asked one of them , if she was willing to pass the Fine without Compulsion ? - She hesitated . - Upon which he asked her where she was born , and what her Maiden Name was ? She appeared confused . Another of the Women who was behind , fell in a Swoon ; and the third , which , I think was Prestidge , came behind the first , and told her it would be best to discover the Truth ; upon which ( before the Men came in ) they confest the Whole , and said that Thomas Griffith had drawn them in . P. Coun . Was the sole Examination over ? Had they perfected the Fine before the Discovery was made ? Mr. B . The first Woman hesitated at the beginning of the sole Examination . P. C. Then the other two Women had not been examined at all ? Mr. B. I think they had not . P. C. Do n't his Lordship sign the Caption , when the Examination is perfected , and the Fines are acknowledged ? Mr. B . Yes . P. C. And had he sign 'd this ? Mr. B . No . P. C. Then it was not perfected - Are not your Questions to them , only Preparatory ? Mr. B . Yes ; for after those Questions , his Lordship examines the Femme Coverts apart , and when that is over he signs the Caption . P. C. If a Woman refuses , would his Lordship sign it ? Mr. B . No ; it would be return 'd . P. C. Then I submit it , that here is no Fine acknowledged . King 's Council . Call Jeremiah Scruby - Did you acknowledge any Fine before my Lord Chief Justice Eyre , in February last ? J. Scruby . No . K. C. Did you consent that any other should do it in your Name ? J. S. No ; but I had consented to sell some Land to my Brother-in Law , Mr. Smith , I and my Wife were willing he should have it , if it was his Right , and we had given it under our Hands to sell it . It was my Wife 's Right , and I claim 'd it by her . P. C. Do you know what a Fine is ? J. S. No . P. C. As you and your Wife had sign 'd to sell this Land , you were willing to make a Title , and to sign any thing that was necessary ? J. S. Yes , if it was his Right . K. C. John Bridgeman , did you levy any Fine in February last , or consent that any should be levy 'd in your Name ? J. Bridgeman . No . P. C. But you agreed to let your Brother Smith have the Land ? J . B . He had purchased his part 20 Years ago , and I was content he should sell it , for I had set my Hand to a Paper . K. C. Margaret Bridgeman , had you acknowledged any Fine , or consented that it should be done in your Name ? M. B . No ; but I had sign 'd to sell the Land . P. C. And was not you willing to consent to any thing necessary to make a Title ? M. B . Yes . Thomas Robinson I and my Wife had sold the Land to my Brother , and I had received my Dividend for it , and gave him Power to do any thing necessary to make a fair Conveyance . P. Coun . So that this does not appear to be a Design to injure any Body , but only a Contrivance to save the Trouble and Expence of fetching so many Witnesses out of the Country . But let us now compare the Indictment with the Precipe . The Clark read the Precipe while the Council looks over the Indictment . P. C. In the Indictment it is said , that they did corruptly make an Acknowledgement of a Fine to Thomas Parker , and Samuel Lynn only ; but in the Precipe it is , to Thomas Parker and Samuel Lynn jointly , for their Lives , and the Remainder to the Heirs of Parker . A very material Difference ! Court . The Indictment and Precipe are indeed variant , and the Prisoners must be acquitted . And they were acquitted by the Jury . The Trials being ended , the Court proceeded to give Judgment as follows : Received Sentence of Death 2. Rose Moreton , and William Sidwell , otherwise Robinson . Rose Moreton pleaded her Belly ; but a Jury of Matrons being impannel 'd , they found her not quick with Child . Burnt in the Hand 3. John Bangham , convicted last Sessions . Dubartus Stiff , and Elizabeth Harrison . Transportation 21.
