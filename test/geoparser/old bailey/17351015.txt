They were a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Sarah Edwards . I live in Denmark Court . Three Weeks and three Days before the death of the Deceas 'd , I lett a Room up two pair of Stairs backwards to Margaret Hambleton , Widow . Her two Daughters ( the other two Prisoners ) lived with her , and she said she had another Daughter ( the Deceased ) who lived in a Merchant 's Service , and that she seldom had an Opportunity of seeing her above once a Year . And I never saw this Daughter alive . There was one Betty Camay , that used to come to see the Prisoners almost every Day . On the seventeenth of September about noon , a Boy came to my House with a Coffin . I told him he mistook the House . He said , No , for Margaret Hambleton , my Lodger , had ordered it to be brought for a Maid who was out of Place and died suddenly . So I went up with the Boy to her Door with a piece of Packthread and a Stick put into the Staple , for there was no Lock ; I bounced against it , and forced it open , and behind it the Deceased lay dead on the Floor , covered all but her Face with a piece of an old Flock Bed . There was no living Person there , nor any Furniture , not so much as a Stool or a Chair . I was frighted , and went down with the Boy . He waited for his Money , and by-and-by Margaret the Mother , and Rebecca her eldest Daughter came home . The Mother said to the Boy , I see you are got here before me . I asked her if she had any body dead in her Room . She answered , What 's that to you . I told her if it was so , she ought to have acquainted me with it , Truly , says her Daughter , you have a great deal of Impudence to ask if any body 's dead in our Room . You do n't know nor never shall , for it is none of your business . And so they and the Boy went up I went and told my Neighbours , who sent for the Searchers , and I sent for my Husband , who was upon the Guard at St. James 's - I do not know that the Prisoners ever had any Furniture in the Room , for I never saw them bring any in . The Searchers came about Candle-light , and we went up . The Door was then fastened as before . I got it open and we found the Body in the Coffin , and a Pan whelmed on the Lid . The Mother and Daughter were then gone out again , but in a little while they returned , and the other Daughter Peggy , and Betty Caway came with them . Hy ! Hy ! says the Mother , How came you to have the Impudence to come into my Room ? Do you want to rob me of my Goods ? The Searchers asked her why she did not tell the Neighbours of the young Woman 's being dead . She said it was her own dear Child , her own dear Kitty , and she died of Convulsion Fits . There was a bloody Rag pinned about her Neck . There were black Marks about her Throat , a Bruise on her Temple , another on her Cheek , one on her Shoulder , and one on her Breast , but the rest of her Body was very fair ; and the Searchers said , she could not die of Convulsions , because her Nails were white and clear . There was a place on the Floor where the Deceased first lay , that was mopt up and seemed to be bloody . David Edwards . I was sent for home , and the Prisoners coming in afterwards , I asked the Mother , Why she did not acquaint us of the young Woman 's being dead in the House . She said she died in the Morning , and she did not care to disturb us . I look 'd round the Room , and seeing only a Flock Bed no bigger than a Sack , I asked them if there was all their Goods , and what I must have for my Rent . The eldest Daughter said , they never designed to pay me any . Then she wiped the Purging at the Deceas'd 's Nose and Mouth , and thereupon she bled fresh Blood , as if a Vein had been opened . I lay on the Ground Floor , and heard no Noise in the Night . Jane Twentyman , Searcher . We went first by Candle-light , but the Deceased bled so much at her Mouth and Nose that we could not observe the Marks about her Neck ; but next Morning we went again , and found she was bruised much under the right Ear , where the Skin was raised and several Bruises about the Neck and Shoulders , but the rest of her Body was clear , and her Hands and Fingers were white and open . Her Mother said she died of Convulsion Fits , but I think she must have been strangled . For in Convulsion Fits , the Nails and Fingers will be black thus far , and the Bowels will presently turn green - I advised them to send for a Surgeon who had more Skill than I. Elizabeth Caway . The Prisoners worked at my Mothers at stiching of Stays . About a Fortnight before the Deceased 's death , her Mother told me that she was sick with Fits , and was to come home from her Service . I went to see her two or three Days after she came home ; she had a violent black Eye , and looked as if she had been beat . I asked her if she had Fits , and she said no . The Saturday before the Deceased died , her Sister Peggy ( the Girl there ) came to our House crying , and said , her Mother had been beating her Sister Kitty ( the Deceased . ) I went down to a Chandler 's Shop , and there I saw the other Prisoner Beck at the Door . She was crying too , and said to me , You never saw such a barbarous Creature as my Mother , I lifted Kitty off the Bed and set her to lean against the Window , and my Mother knocked her down on the Floor with her Fist , and said , D - ye , it 's all along of you ! and Kitty looked up , and asked what that was for ? On Sunday Morning I went to see her . She was sitting on the old Flock Bed which my Mother gave them out of Charity , for they had no other Furniture . I asked her if she knew me , and she put her Hand up to her Forehead , and said , O Lord , what must I do ? She said no more , and they afterwards told me , that was the last Word she spoke . I went again on Monday ( the Day before she died ) and then she was dozing , but did not seem to be troubled with any Distemper - They said they had given her two of Ward 's Pills , and next Day in the Afternoon I found her lying dead on the Floor . Her Mother said she died in Fits , and wiped her Nose , but the more she wiped , the more clear Blood came . They put her in the Coffin , and mop 'd up some blood behind the Door , and then came to my Mothers and drank Tea . I came back with them at Candle-light , and several People were then in their Room . The Mother said , I think here is a hundred People , if I had any Goods I might be robbed . Beck wiped the Deceased 's Mouth , and Blood came out of her Mouth and Nose . Mary Simmons . I lodge at Mrs. Edward 's up one pair of Stairs backward in the Room under where the Prisoners lay . On Saturday the thirteenth of September between eleven and twelve at Night , I heard a sort of a thump as if some body had been knocked down , and then I heard one Shriek , and after that , a shuffling of Feet as if two or three had been shuffling one from another . Philip Cadogan . When the Girl Peggy was examined in Covent Garden Roundhouse , she would make no Confession , but just as we were going to shut the Door , she said , O good God ! what would become of my poor Mother if I was to tell the truth ? Mr. Wilkie , Surgeon . On Saturday after the Deceased 's death , at the desire of the Coroner , I viewed the Body in St. Martin 's Work house . On each side of her Neck there was a Mark of Fingers ; the Skin was quite rubbed off across the Throat , and from one Mark to the other there was part of a black Circle , all which appeared to be made by a violent Pressure on the Gullet , and from thence I judge that she had been strangled . There was a Bruise on her Shoulder , but I did not think that material . As she had been dead so long , I could form no Judgment as to her having had Fits . Q . Could she have been strangled without leaving a Mark quite round her Neck ? Mr. Wilkie . Yes ; for by pressing the Gullet the Vessels would be obstructed , and she would be strangled of course . George Beckington . I lodge in the same House , and the Sunday Se'nnight before her death she was brought to our House by her eldest Sister , who led her up Stairs . Her Face was half muffled up , and I saw she had a very black Eye . Then the Prisoners made their Defence . The Mother . My Daughter lived at John Caldecot 's in Gray 's Inn Lane . She , having two Fits there , would leave her Service and come home . When she came she had a black Eye , and said she was very sick . She had one Fit that Night , and three every Night after . But on Sunday she had Ten , and on Monday Thirteen . I carried her to Dr. Metcalf in Drury Lane , who blooded her , and after that she was blooded by an Apothecary in Princes Street . Rebecca . She came home vastly bad , and lay down , and I cover 'd her up , and burnt some Gin and gave her , and she had but one Fit that Night . Next Day she sent me to pawn her Stays for two Shillings , which I did , and bought a bit of Mutton , and made her some Broth , but she afterwards grew worse , and at last died in a Fit . The Jury acquitted them . 8. Mary Hansel , was indicted for marrying Thomas Sears , August 2 . her former Husband Thomas Petty being then living . Acquitted . 9. Ann Richardson , was indicted for stealing two Porringers , three Shirts , & c. the Goods of Enoch Wilton , September 9 . Acquitted . 10 , 11 , 12. George Sutton * , and Samuel Goodman + , were indicted with William Beesly ++ ( not yet taken ) for stealing 2 s. from a Person unknown , June 1 . * In December last George Sutton was indicted ( but not then taken ) with his Brother John for robbing Abigail Bingo in Cornhill . He was an Evidence against four Street-Robbers in Sept. 1732 , and was tryed ( with William Simmons ) in Sept. 1733 , for robbing Philip Turft in Marybone fields ; but acquitted . + Beesly was try 'd in December last for robbing John Atkinson in White.chapel.fields . Acquitted . ++ In January 1732-3 , S - Goodman was an Evidence against John Ackers , John Wetton , and William Booth . And in June 1733 he was indicted ( but not taken ) with Thomas Kelly and Laurence Grace for a Street-Robbery . Thomas Winn . Some Time in June last the Prisoners and I , and Will . Beesly , and another , went into Chelsea Fields , and there , between Ten and Eleven at Night , Sutton and Beesly knocked down a Gentleman , and took his Money , I can not tell how much , but Sutton afterwards gave me Two Shillings for my Share of it - I lay in the Ditch ready to assist them . Q . Where was Goodman ? Winn . He lay in the Ditch too ; but I do n't know that he was acquainted with their Design ( for I never saw him before that Night ) nor that he had any Part of the Money . Sutton . What Places do you say we were at before and after the Robbery ? Winn . I came directly from my Mistress ( Mrs. How 's ) House in St. Martin 's Church-yard , and after the Robbery I went home again - We afterwards agreed to rob my Mistress 's House . Ann Wilson . I lived a Servant to Mrs. Sutton ( the Prisoner George Sutton 's Mother ) from May to July , and in that Time I never knew him to be out after Ten at Night . I always let him in , and he could not go out afterwards without my Knowledge , for I lay in the next Room to him , and there was only a Wainscot Partition between us . Mary Sutton . My Son George never was from home after 10 at Night all the Months of June and July , but having an unhappy Character , he has often been taken up - I have too much Cause to remember the Time I speak of , for his poor unfortunate Brother was executed on the 4th of June . James Badham . I live in Joiner's-street in Southwark , and deal in Cyder and Dorchester-Beer . The Prisoner Goodman is my Brother-in Law , and lives with my Mother in Westminster . He fell sick that Day as John Sutton was hanged , and continued ill for two or three Weeks after . Ann Goodman . My Son was ill for three Weeks after Sutton was hanged . He has been at home six Months , and I do n't know that he was out after Candle-lighting in all that Time . The Jury acquitted Goodman and found Sutton Guilty . Transportation . 13.

Oxenham . Tho . Oxenham . I am a Taylor . The Prisoner had been my Servant four or five Days . The Goods I lost were in a little Box in a Chest of Drawers in the Kitchen .

Cath.Rochford . I lodge at Mr. Oxenham 's . The Prisoner owned she took my Goods . Sarah Dehane . The Prosecutor came to me that Morning , and desired me to stop such Goods if they were offered to me ; and soon after , Mary Bradley , who is now in Newgate , brought me this broken Ring , and this pair of Ear-rings . Eliz Dowler . She brought a Diamond Ring to my House , and desired me to lay it up for her . Joseph Farley . As I was sweeping my Master 's Door , she came by and asked me to drink . I saw she had got a fine Ring , and so Molly , says I , the Times are well mended . Aye , says she , last Night I met the French - and he took me to the Bagnio , and offered me a Guinea to lye with me ; and so I took my Opportunity , and stript the Rascal naked . Guilty 39 s. 14.

The Deceased was brought to our Hospital on Tuesday Morning Sept. 2 . He was all over Blood , and had a great Wound on the Right Side of his Head . He told me on Friday , that he met four Men and a Woman , who wounded him so with a Stick and his own Handsaw , but that he did not know them , and that he gave them no Affront , and neither touched them nor spoke to them . He died on Sunday Morning following . John Palmer . I and the Deceased were coming from our Work at Chelsea between Seven and Eight at Night , and were over-taken by the Prisoners and three others near Bloody-bridge . I do n't know that a Word was spoken , but Webb knock 'd me down into a Ditch . When I got up , I saw my Master , the Deceased , lying on his Back in the Field . I said , You have killed my Master . And they said , Let him dye and be damned : You shall go with us . And so they sent me to the Gatehouse , and swore we had assaulted them . Webb . You gave the first Affront . Palmer . We said not a Word to them , nor they to us , before I was knocked down . John Gray . My Father the Deceased said he was used in a barbarous Manner , but he was not sensible to say by whom . - When Rose Jackson was carried to the Gatehouse she owned that she and Richard Freeman ( who was tried and acquitted last Sessions ) were in Company when my Father was killed , but said they did not do it . Tho Mollineux . Webb 's Father keeps an Alehouse in Vine-street , St. James 's . He shew 'd me this Hand-saw , and said his Son brought it home , and told him he pick 'd it up in Chelsea Fields . I know it was the Deceased 's Saw , for I bought it for him . Dr. Middleton . There was a large Fracture on the Right Side of the Head ; the Skull was broke to pieces , and the pieces forced quite down upon the Brain by the Violence of the Blow , which without doubt was the Cause of his Death . Webb . I was coming with some Company from Chelsea , the Deceased and Palmer affronted us , and Palmer was the first Man that struck , and the Deceased was the next . - I found the Saw in the Field ; the Justice bid me give it to the Constable , but he would not take it , and so I carried it to my Father 's . Abr . Webb the Elder . My Son came home at Ten at Night , and brought the Saw which was bloody . John Flaningan , Rich . Freeman , Rose Jackson , and several more came with him . Flaningan was cut down the Head and cross the Arm , and bled very much . Rich Gough .

Several deposed that the Prisoners bore the Characters of sober peaceable Persons : And the Jury acquitted them . 18. Thomas Love , was indicted for stealing 75 Yards of Woollen Cloth , Value 40 l. the Goods of John Simmonds , Sept. 5 . Robert Bond , Potter . On Friday Night between 6 and 7 , going up Fish-street-hill with the Cloth , I pitched it upon a Bulk at the Olive Tree , an Oil-shop . The Prisoner came up and asked me if I had seen a Boy come out of that Shop . I answered , No . The Rascal , says he , has got the Key of the Door . - Do so much as step to the Cross-Keys-Inn , and ask for a Hamper directed for Mr. Jackson , that is my Name , and I keep this House . I 'll take Care of your Bundle the while , and give ye Three-pence now , and Three-pence when you come back . So he gave me Three-pence , and I left the Cloth on the Bulk , but when I returned he was gone . After a long Enquiry , and describing him to several People , I heard that such a Person who used to follow such Practices , lodged at a Barber 's Shop in Rose-and-Crown Court in Moorfields , and there I found him , and am positive that he is the Man , for I saw him plainly by the Light of the Evening , and a Light in an Apothecary 's Shop . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 19. John Burton , was indicted for marrying Elizabeth Simmer , Dec. 3 . 1733 , his former Wife , Ann Clark being then living .

John Martin , About Ten o'Clock on Sunday Night , as I was going by the Magpye Tavern at Aldgate , the Prisoner stood at the Door , and asked me to give her a Glass of Wine . We had five or six half Pints of Wine . She put one Hand under my Chin , and said , Come , my Dear , fill my Glass for me ; and so I did , but putting my Hand in my Pocket soon after , I mist my Money , among which was a French Half Crown . I charged her with picking my Pocket , but she denied it . The Landlord came in ; I told him I had been robb 'd , but he only laugh 'd at me . Then she offer 'd me the French Half Crown to be easy , but I would not take it , and so she threw it upon the Table . At last , upon my making a Noise , a Constable came , and I desired him to search her , but the Landlord pushed her aside and would not let him . The Constable then said he must carry us both to the Counter . - I thought it was very hard to lose my Money and go to the Counter too . Prisoner . He laid the Half Crown under the Candlestick , and said I should have it if I would humour him in his Way so and so , which is very unheathenly to mention ; whereof when I refused , he charged me with picking his Pocket .

Col. Des Romaine . On the twenty fifth of October , 1733. about eight at Night , I heard some body knock at the Door . My Maid who was below , not coming up , I took a Candle and went to the Door my self . As soon as I had unbolted it , a Man thrust his Foot between the Door and the Threshold , and seizing me by the Shoulder , swore he must have my Money , and if I made a Noise , he would shoot me dead . However , I pushed the Door as hard as I could with my Hand , and cryed out Murder , and called to my Maid , and bid her call my Men to bring the Pistols . I was in hopes by this to make the Rogues think I had Men in the House , though I had none . But presently I was struck across the Head with a Cutlace . I still kept the Door to , upon which another of them said , D - him , beat his Brains out : and then I received such a Blow with the Butt end of a Pistol , that I lost two of my Teeth , and was afraid my Eye was put out . I fell down , and four Men rushed in . One of them went towards the Maid , and the other three rifled me of a Gold Watch , two Rings , about fifteen or sixteen Shillings in Silver . While they were searching my right Pockets , I slipt a Purse with six Guineas and a half out of my left Fob and thrust it under the Matt on the Floor . They tyed my Hands , and dragged me up Stairs , and threatned , and struck me again with a Pistol to make me discover where my Money was , but I told them I had none . They opened my Trunk , and took out a Box of Plate . The Trunk had a double Cover , in which I had forty five Guineas and a half . They did not then open the upper Cover , which gave me some hopes that they would not find the Money . They took two Pistols and a Silver-hilted Sword out of a Closet . One of them was for breaking the Blade , but the others opposed it . After this they all three took me down Stairs again , and at the Parlor Door I saw my Maid lying with her Petticoats turned up , and the fourth Man putting up his Breeches . He was very tall , and like the Prisoner , but I can not be positive to his Face , for the Blood run over my Eyes , so that I could hardly see . Then they tyed my Hands behind me so hard , that the Cord was hid under the Flesh of my Wrists , which put me to such violent Pain that I thought the Torture of putting the Question could not be worse , and the Marks made by the Cords remained in my Wrists for a Year after . They put a Napkin over my Face and the Maids Petticoat and Gown over my Head , and in this Condition I remained from eight at Night till three the next Morning . They bound the Maid close by me in the Parlor . I heard her say , For God 's sake let me alone . I could feel her move , and hear them go backwards and forwards . They came to me several times and beat me over the Head with a Pistol , but her Petticoat broke the Blow . One of them said , O ye old Rogue ! You told us you had no Money . By which I concluded that they had found the Guineas in my Trunk . I desired them not to abuse me in that manner , but rather kill me , and so put me out of my Misery . Presently I felt something like a Hanger put under the Petticoat to my Neck . Upon which my Maid cried , For God 's sake do not kill my Master , rather kill me . Between two and three o'Clock , hearing no Noise , I told my Maid that I believed they were gone . She said she feared they were not , and begged me for God 's sake not to hazard my Life . However , I ventured to move about till at last I got my Back towards her , and she with much Difficulty untyed my Hands , and being thus got loose , I went into the Passage . I perceived a Light in the Fore Parlor , which at first gave me some Apprehensions that they were not yet gone . But hearing nothing stit , I ventured forward and found no body , and the Door was left ajar . Ralph Mitchel . Brown and Whitlock * ( who were since executed for this Fact ) and I being Prisoners in the New Jail , agreed to rob Mr. Sherrack the King 's Jeweller at Paddington , Brown and I were acquitted at Croydon Assizes , and Whitlock was acquitted in the Country . We committed several Robberies on the Highway . And Brown and I meeting afterwards at Paddington , we happened to quarrel , and so we parted without doing any business at that time . But I going into Southwark met with Whitlock , and went to drink at Pepper Alley . He asked me where Brown lived . I told him that Brown and I both lodged at one White 's an Alehouse at the Hand-and-Flower in the Grainge near Barnaby Street . On the twenty fifth of October we all three met at White 's and agreed to rob the King 's Jeweller that Day , but we wanted another Hand . So we went to Rag Fair to see for Long Will , not the Prisoner , but another Long Will , one William Simon who is hanged . We could not meet with him , and so we went to an old Friend of ours one John Gasley ( Garscee ) who kept a Brandy-shop in Tyburn Road , and asked him to go with us , but he said he had left off dealling that way , and that he did not care to venture again . Brown asked him if he knew where Long Will ( the Prisoner ) was . Yes , says Gassy , I believe he is at his Mothers , and I will step and fetch him ; but while we we were talking , the Prisoner came in . We drank a Bowl of Punch together above Stairs , and told him what Lay we were upon . He made no Objection , but that he had no Arms , upon which I lent him one of my Pistols , and so about seven o'Clock we went to the King 's Jeweller 's House , but seeing an Iron Grate in the Door to look through , they said it would never take . However , says I , let us do Business if we can . Ring the Bell , and see whether they will open the Door or not . So we rung , and a Servant coming to the Door , we asked her if Madam de Batt was there . She answered , No , she is just gone . So we went away and consulted what do ; we agreed to go to Col. Romaine 's , which we did . Brown and I went foremost , and having put back the Bolt of the Yard Door , we came to the Door of the House and knocked . The Colonel himself opened it , and I thrust my Foot in between the Door and the Threshold , and struck him on the Head with a Cutlace . He cryed out Murder , and called to his Maid to bid his Men bring the Pistols . But we forced in , and as we were tying his Hands , Whitlock and the Prisoner came in , and I asked them why they did not come up sooner . We risled him and bound his Hands behind him , and carried him into the back Parlor . The Prisoner seiz 'd the Maid , who came up with a Candle , and we tyed her Hands in the same Room . Then I and Brown and Whitlock took the Colonel up Stairs to make him shew us where the Money was , and left the Prisoner with the Maid . We began to break open a Chest , but he desired us to untie his Hands , and he would give us the Keys . We took out a parcel of Plate , and some Pearl Necklaces , but I saw no Money there , and if they found any they sunk it . We went up another Pair of Stairs , and turned the Beds up to examine them . We took a rough Draught of what was there - * See their Trial in December 1733 . + See the Trial of John Gassey in the Sessions Paper for July 1722 . - What do you mean by a rough Draught ? Mitchel . We gave a look round the Room , and then went into his Daughter 's Chamber and broke open a Chest of Drawers and took out some Head Clothes and other Women 's Apparel . We went again to the Colonel , bound his Hands again behind him , and carried him down Stairs with us . Coming into the Entry , we saw the Maid lying with her Coats up , and the Prisoner on his Knees putting up his Breeches . D - ye you Rogue , says I , You ought to think of other things at such a time as this . And turning to the Maid , I said , my Dear , has he hurt ye ? She made no answer , but cryed . Whitlock often went to the Colonel , and threatned him to make him discover his Money , and once he took a Knife and was going to cut his Throat . After this we brought the Things all into one Room and packed them up , and went away about three in the Morning . The Prisoner had the Plate in a Box , and I put what Goods I had in a Basket . We staid in the Fields till the Watch was gone off , and then took Water to Pepper Alley , and went from thence to White 's in the Grange , where Brown and I and our Wives lodged . Brown 's Wife let us in , and we went into her Room , where we opened the Goods and shared the Linnen . Brown and I and Whitelock went with the Gold Watch and Plate to Edward Bodenham * at the Ship Alehouse in the Old Bailey , and sold it all to him for twenty five Pound . We went back and gave the Prisoner his Share of this Money , and two Guineas more for his Snack in the Brocades . It being then near Night , he said he must go over the Water , and would return in a little while . But I saw him no more till he was apprehended - I have known him four or five Years , but never was concerned with him in any Fact besides this . * See the Trial of Bodenham in the Sessions Paper for December 1733 . Prisoner , Prove that I ever was in your Company . Mitchel . My Wife can do that . Mitchel 's Wife . I have known the Prisoner from a Child . He came between three and four that Morning with my Husband and Whitlock and Brown to our House ; they brought brocaded Silk Clothes , Holland Shirts , Laced Head Clothes , a Gold Watch , Silver Forks , Silver-handled Knives , Silver Salts , a Silver-hilted Sword , and two Pistols , and other things . It not being quite light , I said to the Prisoner , I should know you by your Tongue . Is not your Name Blackwell , was not you a Soldier , and did not you live in St. Giles 's , and sell Geese and Rabbitt ? Yes , says he , and I have known you from a Child . Where did you get these Goods ? says I ; my Husband answered , they had been a Smuggling . But when he and Brown and Whitlock were gone to sell the Plate , the Prisoner told me they got the Goods at Colonel Romaines . William Kirk . I have known the Prisoner eighteen or nineteen Years . On the twenty ninth of September last , between nine and ten o'Clock at Night , as I was going home , I saw the Prisoner on Horseback and very drunk , at the end of Earl 's Court in Drury Lane . One Sarah Burgess was persuading him to go home , but he swore he would not . Why do n't you go , says she , There 's Will . Kirk . I had taken but little notice of him before , but upon hearing this , I looked at him , and he swore he would shoot me . I went round Red Lyon Court , and came again into Drury Lane , and found him at Sarah Burgess 's Door at the Corner of Colstair 's Court . I went to Brocks ( Brogdon Poplet 's ) and told him that Long Will . was hard by and we might take him . But Brock said it was not worth his while , for there was but forty Pound for taking him . Upon this I went to George Redgate , and got him to assist me . We went after the Prisoner , and found him in Broad St. Giles 's , and another Man with him . We thought it not proper to seize him till that Man was gone , and so we followed at a distance , till coming towards the Vine Tavern in Holborn , the Man wished him a good Night , and bid him hold by the Horse 's Main . Never fear , Cockey , says the Prisoner , for , D - my Eyes I shall do well enough . The Man being gone , we pulled the Prisoner off his Horse , upon which he cried I am a dead Man ! my Glass is run , D - my Eyes ! We found a Pistol and Powder and Ball in his Pocket ; and as we were carrying him to the Round house , he desired to be made an Evidence . Prisoner . You know nothing of me but down-right Work . Kirk . I have known him eighteen or nineteen Years . He sometimes went with an Orange-Barrow with Twenty-one at three Throws . And sometimes he followed the Thimble and Button .

May 13 . William Stamper . On the 13th of May last , about Nine in the Evening , as I was going home to Shacklewel , four Men stopt me on the Causeway between Shoreditch Church and Kingsland . One of them seized me by the Breast . - What are ye going to do ? says I . Here 's no-body to oppose you ; I have a Watch , a Ring , and Money ; take all , but do n't abuse me Damn your Blood , says he , speak another Word and I 'll blow your Brains out - Come along , They led me down the Lane where Jack Catch was hanged . They took from me my Hat and Wig , a Gold Ring , a Silver Watch , the Silver Buckles out of my Shoes , two Guineas and a Half Crown , and then bound me , and telling me they would send some body to relieve me in five Minutes , they fired a Pistol over my Head and went off ; but no body came . I lay there an Hour by St. Paul 's Clock , which I heard strike ; and if they had not taken my Buckles I had lain longer ; for having got my Shoes off , I at last got my Legs loose . Two of them , Morpeth and Kiff , were convicted of this Robbery in July last , and were both executed . I can not swear positively to the Prisoner . John Cotterel . Morpeth , Kiff and the Prisoner and I went to drink at the Fox Alehouse in Kingsland-Road . We staid till the Dusk of the Evening , and then went out and met the Prosecutor by the Watch-house at Stone-bridge . Morpeth stopt him , and demanded his Money . The Prosecutor started back , and the Prisoner gave him a Punch in the Face : We took him down a Lane and rifled him . They took his Hat , Wig , Watch , Ring and Money , and I took his Buckles . We tied his Legs and Arms behind him , and told him he should be released in a little Time . He asked us how he should know that ? And Morpeth fired a Pistol , and said that was a Sign for one to come to his Relies ; but this was only said to make him easy . We went thence to the Magpye Tavern at Bishopsgate , where they produced Half a Crown and two Half-pence . I said that the Gentleman told me that he had lost two Guineas . They swore then the Gentleman was a Rogue , and that People often pretend to have lost more than they really have . The Prisoner had the Watch and Ring to dispose of , and next Day he told us that he had pawned the Watch for a Guinea and a Half , and sold the Ring ( having knock 'd the Stone out because it had a Coat of Arms in it ) for 4 s. 6 d. 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. 6 d. I forget which - The Buckles were sold for 9 s. to a Goldsmith at the Corner of Moses and Aaron Alley in Whitechapel . The Wig was valued by Philip Lacy a Barber in Whitechapel , at 16 s. We flung Dice for it at his House , and Morpeth won it . John Claxton . I was at the taking the Prisoner in a Back Lane by Whetstone . He told me if they hanged him it would be for his Good , for then , d - his Eyes , he should do no more Mischief . John Bury . When he was carried before the Justice , he said , D - my Eyes , I know I shall be cast , but I sha'n't be jamm 'd ; for I have good Friends who can save me , but if they wo n't they may be damn 'd .

I was married to the Prisoner on Shrove Tuesday at St. Anne 's Lime-house , and I saw his first Wife this Day in the Work-house in St. George 's Middlesex .

William King . About Nine at Night my Apprentice sent for me from the Tavern , and told me the Prisoner , who was then in my Shop , had stole my Goods . I took the Prisoner backwards , and calling in two of my Workmen , I charged him with taking such Goods . After a long Hesitation , and often desiring me to go up Stairs , he gave me 16 Verges out of his Mouth ( all of them were of no greater Bulk than a Chew of Tobacco ) 17 Studs of Brass , 23 Ballances , 10 Setts of Steel Works , belonging to Watch - Movements , three Pounds and three Quarters of Brass , and a File , out of his Pockets . He said he was ashamed of and sorry for what he had done , and begged for Mercy , and that I would not send him to Jail . Prisoner . Did not I deliver them to you the Minute you came in , and tell you that I intended to buy them , and not to defraud you ? King . No . It was a long Time before I could bring him to confess . John Cushion . The Prisoner came into the Shop for some Brass , and bought a little . Then he wanted some Ballances . I shewed him a Parcel , but soon missing some of them , I watched him . Next he asked for Verges ; I told out 32 , and saw him put several into his Mouth , and I had but 27 back ; and besides , I miss 'd a Dozen out of the Box ; and after that I miss 'd ten Steel Works ; upon which I made an Excuse to send for my Master , and when he came I spoke to him aside , and told him what the Prisoner had done - All that the Prisoner bought came but to Nine-pence Half-penny . Robert Harper and Samuel Milburn confirmed Mr.King 's Evidence . Prisoner . I had dealt two or three Years at the Shop , and went as usual to buy Goods , but being in Drink , I took what I intended to buy and put them in my Pocket . Mrs. Edwards .

I asked what was the Matter ? and she told me that her Mother had sent her for two Herrings ; that the Prisoner bid her come again and he would give her one for herself ; that she went ; that he took her into a Back Room , and gave her a Dram , and sat her in his Lap , and put his Hands up her Coats , and told her - I do n't know how to speak it - but he told her he must - And that then he laid her on the Floor , and did as he said . That she cried out very loud , but no body heard her . Upon this I sent for her Mother , and upon examining we found that some Man had abused her . Mrs. Marshall . My Girl told me that the Prisoner had used her in a violent Manner . I found her in a very bad Way , and was frighted to see that a Man had been medling with her . Prisoner . Did not I send a Surshon ? Mrs. Marshall . Yes , a Fortnight after , but I would not let him see the Child . Q . When did you complain ? Mrs. Marshall . This was done on the 11th of April . On the 18th I sent for a Surgeon , and the next Day I went to Hicks 's Hall , and preferred a Bill for an Attempt . Q . How came a Bill afterwards to be found for a Rape ? Mrs. Marshall . I left it to my Attorney . Elizabeth Palmer , Midwife . I searched the Girl on the 17th of April . She was very much torn , and had a foul Distemper . On the 19th I went to a Surgeon , and told him I fancy 'd she was clapt , by what I found upon her Linnen . He said he believed the same . And I 'll swear that a Man had enter 'd her in a barbarous Manner . Mr. Hawkins , Surgeon . The Girl complained of a Smart . I saw her Linnen turn 'd up , and it was discolour 'd with a Running . I was in some doubt as to her Disorder , but I gave her Medicines as for the French Disease , and the Distemper submitted to them . Mr. Matthews , Apothecary . I thought by her Linnen , that her Disorder was Venereal . Prisoner . I brought an Action against deem in de King 's Bench for Scandal , and den dey indict me for dis Rape . Elizabeth Frazier . I lodge in the Prisoner 's House . On the eleventh of April , I was in his little Room behind the Shop from eight in the Morning till eleven at Night , and was not out of it except twice or thrice in the Day-time , when I just stept into my own Room and down again . But from nine at Night to eleven I was not once out . The Girl came between nine and ten for two Herrings , and carried them away , but she came no more that Night , nor was she at all in the little Room . And Mrs. Tomson , who then lodged in the same House , but is since dead , was with me in that Room from eight till past ten : Next Day , as the Prisoner and I and the Spanish Embastinder 's Silver Smith ( who is now gone over Sea ) were sitting in that Room , this Girl and another came in for a Quartern of Gin ; they laughed and talked how they had served two Boys , and this Girl said , I paid his Shins with the Fire-shovel , I love to play at Man and Wife , but I do not like him . She came two or three times that Day for Gin , upon which the Prisoner said to his Wife , why do you let them Girls drink Gin ? I would have you deny them . As to the Prisoner 's Character , he is a very honest Man as far as I know . Elizabeth Hammond . So he is , and I lodge in his Cellar under that little Room , and I heard no Noise that Night - I saw the Girl on the fifteenth of April . She said the Prisoner had had to do with her to be sure . I asked her why she did not cry out . Because , says she , he gave me a Dram of Anniseed , and I shall have a pretty Baby of my own to nurse , and that will be better than crying out . John West , Surgeon . I was desired on the third of May to search the Girl , but her Parents refused to let me see her .

Roger Ferris , Ann Fullerton , Thomas Clark and Elizabeth Clark , deposed that the Prisoner had the general Character of an honest Man . Margaret Sampson , deposed , that Suky Marshall was well known to every body for all manner of Impudence . In reply to which , Ann Cooper and Hannah Edge deposed , that they knew Suky Marshall very well , and never saw any thing in her like Impudence or Forwardness , but that she was a very sober , modest , virtuous Girl , and that the Prisoner was a very litigious Man .

They were a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Martha Harper . I went into Mr. Humphries 's Brandy shop , in Winford Street , to spend a Half-penny . The Deceased was there , and who should come in but this Mary Price . Now the Deceased was a mighty joaking Man , and he told her she curried a clean Heel , G - D - ye , says she , what is that like ? Why , says he , It is like an Irish Leg , as thick at bottom as it is at top . With that she up with her Leg and kicked him on the Parts , and he hit her a Box on the Ear . She reel 'd against the Door , and said , Call my Cosin , call my Cousin ; she is at a Gin shop next Door . So came her Cousin ( the other Prisoner Armstrong ) with an Oyster Knife in her Hand , and swore she 'd cut his Nose off . He laughed , and said , sure you wo n't serve me so ? She swore yes but she would , and called him Irish Thief . She went out , he followed , she gave him a Push , and I do n't know whether he pushed her again , but she turned short and stabbed him in the Breast . When he saw his Blood , he knocked her in the Kennel ; and while he was beating her there , she cut him in the Leg . And her Aunt Price called out , Kill him Betty , kill him . Price . I was not in the Street till all was over . Martha Harper . Yes , she was in the Street before the Stab . Harry Wallis . I live opposite to the Brandy-shop , and about ten Minutes past two in the Afternoon Armstrong came out with a Knife and struck at the Deceased several times .

Christopher Sallet . Between three and four the same Afternoon , I was at a Brandy-shop in Baker 's Arms Alley , Rag Fair , when Armstrong came in very dirty , and I asked her who had been tumbling her in the Mud . She answered , A little Irish Man , but I struck my Knife in his Breast thus far , and I wish it had been in his Heart 's Blood . I went to Winford Street to see the Deceased ( for I knew him ) and he died in my Arms between six and seven the same Day . James Farwell , a Soldier . I was drinking with the Deceased , who sat on a Bench . Price coming in , he told her she had cleaver Legs , as thick at the bottom as top , and then he touched the String of her Shoe . She kicked his Privities . He gave her a Box on the Ear . She called for her Cousin Armstrong , who came and threatned to cut his Nose off . Arm-Strong went out , he followed , and was stabbed while I was in the Shop , but when I went out they were all three down , and I saw his Shoe full of Blood . I carried him to a Surgeon in four Minutes , which which was about half an Hour after he went out of the Shop . James Atkinson , Surgeon . The Deceased was brought to me between two and three . He had a Wound near the Armpit which past obliquely towards the Sternum , but there was no penetration in the Cavity of the Thorax . He had another an Inch and a half deep in the Calf of his Leg . I drest his Wounds , and they were both trivial , but for want of due care , the Hemorrhage of Blood from the Calf of his Leg contributed to his Death , for he was harrasded about for two or three Hours , and no body would take him in . And his Animal Spirits being exhausted , he might be be suffocated for want of having his Head laid in a proper position . Besides , I heard that after he was wounded he fought with a Sailor , which might hasten his Death . - Wallis . After the Wound was given he went towards the Brandy-shop , and a Sailor coming by they had two or three Blows . But the People saying , Are not you ashamed to fight with a Man that is stabbed , and then the Sailor went away . Jane Tomkins . I looked out at Window and saw Armstrong push at the Deceased , he got hold of her Wrists , but she got loose and stabbed him thus down the Breast ; I cryed out , Beat her , beat her , and then he pulled her Head in the Kennel . A Sailor coming by , said to him , D - ye ! what Son of a B - are you , to beat a Woman ? Upon which , the Deceased quitted the Woman , and two or three Blows past between him and the Sailor , but it was over in a Minute , for I called out and said , For God 's sake do not let him beat a wounded Man . Price . The Deceased came behind me , and put his Hand up my Coats , I said , what is that for ye Blockhead ? is there not Wench enough for ye ? What , says he , do ye stomach it ? My Cousin having been opening Oysters next Door , came in with a Knife in her Hand , and then I went out about my Business , but coming back , I saw my Cousin in the Kennel , and the Deceased a beating her , and so I went and took him off . Armstrong . Hearing my Aunt cry out , I went and said to the Deceased . Are not you a foolish Irish Dog to meddle with an old Woman , and then he knocked me down into the Kennel , where he twice put his Hands up my Coats . Two Surgeons deposed , that the Wound did not appear to be mortal . but that the Deceased might have been living if he had taken due care of himself .

My other Bed-fellow and I belonging to a Brewhouse three Doors from my Lodging , and being to get up early , I desired the Prisoner to lie on the farther Side , but he would needs lie next to me . In half an Hour my other Bed-fellow got up to go to Work , and after he was gone I am sure my Money was in the Tail of my Shirt , for I had it in my Hand . I went to sleep , and lay above two Hours , and having over-slept myself , I was called up in a Hurry to go to the Brewhouse ; upon which I dress 'd myself in such haste , that I did not mind whether my Money was safe or not ; but in a Quarter of an Hour after I was come to the Brewhouse , I miss 'd it . I could not immediately leave the Work I was then about , but in about half an Hour more , I went back and met the Prisoner coming out at the Street-Door . I asked him how he could serve me so as to take my Money , when I had been so civil to him . He answered ; What a Noise you make , hold your Tongue , and you 'll get your Money again . So we both went up into my Room , and he pulled off his Shoes , and bid me search him . I called to my Landlady , and bid her keep the Door till I fetched a Constable . But I never found my Money . I did not then know the Prisoner 's right Name , for he went by the Name of Beau Nash . Prisoner . He was in Liquor , and so was I , and I know no more of the Money than the Child unborn . The Jury acquitted him . 50 Thomas Devenish , of St. Luke in Middlesex , Backmaker , was indicted for a Misdemeanour in that on the Back of a Promissory Note ( dated May 25 , 1735 . Signed with the Name of Thomas Devenish , and purporting that the said Devenish promised to pay to William Morris or Order , One Hundred Pounds ) he did forge an Indorsement in these Words and Figures , May 29 , 1735 . Pay the Contents to Thomas Green or Order , William Morris . And that he did utter and publish the said Forged Writing , knowing it to be forged , with an Intent to defraud the said Green and Morris , June 29 . James Graham . This Note was brought to me first by James Northall a Scrivener , ( who was tried last Sessions on the same Account . ) He desired me to get Money for it . I told him I would try . It was then indors 'd , William Morris . I enquir 'd who Morris was , and Northall answer 'd , that Morris was a Smith at the lower End of Broad-Street . Northall came several Times about it , and at last he said he was employ 'd by Devenish ( the Prisoner ) to whom the Note belonged , and to whom I must pay the Money . After this , the Prisoner came himself , and said it was his Note , and that the Name at Bottom was his own Hand . I had directed the Note , that Morris was a Smith in Broad Street , and asked the Prisoner if that Direction was right , and he said it was . I then asked him if he dealt with Morris , and how he came to owe Morris such a considerable Sum . His answer was , that he himself was a Back-maker ; that the Money was owing for Nails and other Things in the Back-making Trade , and that the Sum was not considerable for a Man of his Dealing . This Account I thought was natural enough ; thereupon I told him I hoped to get it discounted in two or three Days . For this Purpose I applied to Mr. Conran , and he to Mr. Green a Jeweller , who offered to give Rose Diamonds at a Market Price for the Note , which I agreed to , because I deal in them my self - It 's Part of my Business , as a Broker , to get Notes discounted . The Brokers do n't usually enquire after the Indorsers ; though it 's what we ought to do , but we leave that to the Person who discounts the Notes - The Prisoner came five or six Times to see if I had done it - As to the Indorsement , there is not a Letter in Morris 's Name that is like his Writing . Thomas Green . Mr. Conran brought this Note to me to see if I would take it for Jewels . - My Glasier living near Morris 's , I asked him if he knew Morris , and if he was a Man of Worth . He said he did not think he was worth Twenty Pounds ; upon which I returned the Note . Mr. Conran came the next Day to know the Reason of it ; I told him it was but a coined Note at best . We went to Morris and shew 'd him the Note . He said the Name was none of his Writing , and he wrote his Name before us , and it was not at all like the Indorsement . Prisoner 's Council . When you saw the Note first were these Words , Pay the Contents to Thomas Green or Order , then indors 'd over the Name of William Morris ? Thomas Green . No . It was a Blank Indorsement , with only the Name of William Morris , and my Attorney bid me tell the Grand Jury that these Words , Pay the Contents to Thomas Green or Order , were writ by Order of the Clerk in the Court . - I do n't take those Words to be writ by the same Hand as writ the Name William Morris . It not appearing that those Words and Figures , May 29 , 1735 . Pay the Contents to Thomas Green or Order , were written by the Prisoner , the Jury acquitted him .
