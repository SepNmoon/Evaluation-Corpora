William Duce and James Butler , of St. Martins in the Fields , were indicted for assaulting John Holms on the High-way , and taking from him a Handkerchief , a Steel Seal , a Hat value 10 s. and 21 s. in Money , the 27th of April last . To this Indictment James Butler Pleaded Guilty : But William Duce refus 'd to plead to the Indictment , but requir 'd first to be examin 'd privately : He would have been made an Evidence for making Discoveries , but the Court not admitting him , he was at last oblig 'd to plead , and pleaded not Guilty . The Prosecutor depos 'd , as he was going over the 5th Field between London and Chelsea , about 10 a Clock at Night , he met four Men ; the first came up to him , behaving himself as if he had been in Liquor , and passed him , the second did the like ; and the third , which was John Dier , came up and put a Pistol to his Breast , and the others came back and rifled him , and took his Hat , but he could swear to neither of the Prisoners ; that having taken from him the things mention 'd in the Indictment , they went away all but John Dier , who stood over him a little while with his Pistol , till the others were gone some Distance ; and while he stood over him with his Pistol , excused the Fact , telling him , they did it from Necessity . John Dier depos 'd , That on the 27th of April , himself , James Butler , William Duce , and Joseph Rice ( who was since shot by the Patrole Guard , in attempting to rob Colonel Chudleigh 's Lady in her Coach in the King 's Road ) met the Prosecutor in Chelsea-fields , that Butler and Duce went after him and stop 'd him , and that then he came up to the Prosecutor , and clapt a Pistol to his Breast ; that Butler rifled his Pockets , and Duce took his Hat , but Rice was hardly come up to them at that time ; that they being gone off , he search 'd his Fob , and took out the Guinea , and two Papers , which he produc 'd in Court , and were own 'd by the Prosecutor . That Duce and Butler sold the Hat in Holbourn for 4 s. 6 d. and that Butler had the Seal a Week after : That Duce had half of the Guinea that he took from the Prosecutor , but Butler had none of it . Mr. Jones depos 'd , that he having heard of the Attempt made upon Colonel Chudleigh 's Lady , and the Persons describ 'd , he having before apprehended some of them , he thought he knew them ; so going to the House of one Auger , who was Sister to William Duce , he there found William Duce and John Dier , and that one of them had a Pistol , which he thinks was Dier . That thereupon he apprehended them , and carried them before Justice Blackabee . Jonathan Wild depos 'd , that he being with them at Justice Blackabee 's , found one of the Prisoners and John Dier to be Acquaintance , in that they had both Pumps on their Feet of the Same Make . Whereupon he ask 'd them , if they did not make them at such a House ; that he had known Williams Duce of a Boy , and that Duce 's Mother came to him , and desir 'd her Son might be made an Evidence , saying , he could make the greatest Discovery . That when he was with Duce in Newgate , he desir 'd to be made an Evidence , and was going to confess to him Facts that had been committed , but John Dier having been before made an Evidence , he would not let him discover any thing to him , least he should be obliged to be an Evidence against him in Court . William Duce deny 'd the Fact , and that ever he had committed any Robbery in his Life , or ever had any Concerns with the Evidence John Dier , or Acquaintance , any more than that he lodg 'd at his Sister 's House . William Duce and James Butler , of the Parish of St. Pancrass , were indicted for assaulting John Monk on the High Way , and taking from him 12 s. in Mony , the 3d of May last . To this Indictment : James Butler pleaded guilty . John Monk depos 'd , That he being a Coachman , was driving his Coach , having been at Hampstead , about half an Hour past Nine a Clock in the Evening ; at a little Bridge between Tottenham-Court and the Turn-Pike , he saw three Men coming towards him . The first ask 'd him if he was hir 'd , and if he was going to London . He having answer 'd them , one of them look 'd into the Coach , and finding no Body there , another of them took hold of his Horses Bridle , and bid him stand and deliver his Money . To which he replied , that was enough to hang a Man ; that the Person that held the Horse Bridle was John Dier the Evidence ; that then he gave them half a Crown , but that not satisfying them , 2 others jump 'd up to him into the Coach Box , and took his Money out of his Pocket , which was 9 s. and 6 d. more ; upon which he told them , it was very hard to take away his Money from him that was a poor Man , who had been working for it all Day . That while they were taking away his Money , they order 'd him not to look at them , so that he could only swear positively to John Dier . That they told him it should be Money in his Way , and took the Number of his Coach , which was 324 . That having done , they bid him drive on , and they made toward Hampstead Road . This was all confirm 'd by the Evidence of John Dier , who added , that the half Crown was receiv 'd of the Coachman by William Duce , and that Duce 's Sister pawn 'd a Bed to raise the Money that bought Pistols for them , to go a robbing with . The Prisoner Duce in his Defence , deny 'd the Fact , was very noisy , and rav 'd against Jonathan Wild , and John Dier , Saying , that he had been an Evidence before ; and that no Man was by the Law of England to be admitted to be an Evidence twice . To prove the first Assertion , he had got a Sessions Paper in his Hand , to which Jonathan Wild reply 'd , in that Case he was a voluntary Evidence , and was not charg 'd with any Crime ; and as to the second Affection , the Court requir 'd him to produce the Statute for it , telling him , they knew not any such Statute ; he reflected on the Justice of the Court , urging that Mr. Holmes 's Evidence , and John Taylor 's Evidence did not agree , as to the Person who first stopp 'd him , but this did not avail him , the Court not finding any Inconsistency in their Evidence . He in his own Justification requir 'd the Court to ask his Accomplice James Butler , whether he , this Prisoner , William Duce , was in either of the Roberies for which they were indicted ; who reply 'd , that tho ' he own 'd he himself was guilty of both the Facts , and threw himself upon the Mercy of the Court , yet William Duce was not concern 'd in either ; altho ' he had in his Confession before the Justice ( which Confession was read in Court ) confess 'd that Duce was an Actor in them . By which he show 'd more Friendship for Duce , that Prudence for himself . Nor was this Denial of any Service to Duce . Whether Duce was drunk , or it was his natural Temper , or both together , I shall not determine , but in his violent raving the proceeded so far as to demand a Question to be ask 'd of John Dier , and Mr. Holmes , which conduc 'd not a little to prove his being a Party concern 'd in the robbing Mr. Holmes . The Question was , who it was that kiss 'd Mr. Holmess Hand ? To which they both reply 'd , that it was John Dier the Evidence , who at parting with Mr. Holmes after he had been robb 'd , did either do it , or made an offer so to do . This being a private Circumstance of the Robbery , that had been omitted , and not mentioned by either Holmes or Dier in Court , it carried in it a very strong Presumption , that he that was privy to that , was also privy to the Robbery . The Jury found them both guilty of both Indictments . Death . Thomas Allen , of the Parish of Eling , was indicted for feloniously stealing a Cloth Coat , value 12 s. and a Shirt , value 2 s. the Goods of Thomas Hopcroft , the 1st of January last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That the Prisoner lodg 'd with him , and went away , and carried off his Coat and Shirt . Other Evidences depos 'd , They saw the Coat on the Prisoner 's Back , and asking him several Times , why he did not carry the Prosecutor his Coat again , he promised he would , but never did ; not ever deny 'd the taking of it . It appear 'd by the Evidence , That the Prisoner was a soft pated Fellow , but supporting him to have Wit enough to distinguish between his own , and what was other Peoples , the Jury found him guilty to the value of 10 d.
