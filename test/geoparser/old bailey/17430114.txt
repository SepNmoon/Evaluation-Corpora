Mary Hardwick . On the 8th of December , a little after nine in the Morning , I missed these Things ; the Door of the House was open : I saw a Woman go out of the Passage , with her Lap full of Things ; but thought , she had mistook the Door , not mistrusting she had stole any Thing , but I missed them soon after ; she was much about the same Stature of this Woman , but was not in the same Dress as she is now ; I only saw her Back , so I can not swear to the Prisoner . Prisoner . That Gentlewoman 's Mother cleared me , she said I was not the Woman , for she could know her from a thousand .

Jane Carter . That good Woman brought these Things to my Shop to sell , she asked me 25 s. for them , and I bargained with her for 20 s. Prisoner . I bought them of one who said her Name was Mary Clark , and that she lived in Short's-Gardens ; I went to this Gentlewoman 's with some other Things . ( for I am a Trader ) says she , the Goods you sold me last were stopped , and it is very hard for me to lose my Money * ; so it is for me said I , and I went with that Gentleman to enquire for Mary Clark , but could not find her ; there was one of that name had lived there , but she had been gone a Twelve-month . * No Sale , Exchange , Pawn , or Mortgage , of any kind of stolen Goods , which shall be sold , & c. in the City of London , or within two Miles thereof , to any Broker or Pawntaker , shall make any Change or Alteration of the Property . 1 James i. c. 21.

On the 22d of December , in the Evening , as I was going by the Corner of Somerset-House , I felt the Shoulder of my Coat bear a little tight upon me , so I immediately turned about , and seized the Prisoner , who was quite close to me , and told him he had picked my Pocket , and should go into the next Shop with me , he told me he would not , and desired I would let him go ; - there was another Person at a little Distance , who seemed to me to be of the same Complexion with this Gentleman , and knowing that they go in Gangs , I was afraid of being attacked by them , so I got him by Force into the Shop : Mr Blakey , who was passing by that Time , told me the Handkerchief was between his Feet , I stopped down and took it up ; there was no Person near me who could possibly pick my Pocket , but the Prisoner : I am sure he is the Person , I know him perfectly well , I did not see him take it out of my Pocket . Mr Blakey . On the 22d of December , about seven in the Evening , I was going by Somerset-House , and heard a Gentleman say , the Fellow has pick 'd my Pocket .

There was a Handkerchief lying upon the Ground just by the Prisoner 's Feet , said I , Sir , is that your Handkerchief , he said it was , and I think Mr Mills took it up himself , he carried the Prisoner into a Hosier's-Shop , by Somerset House ; and he was afraid of being insulted by others of the Gang , so sent for a Guard from Somerset-House , who carried the Prisoner before Justice Frasier . - The Handkerchief lay very near him , and there was nobody else near , who could possibly take it . - There was another Fellow about two or three Yards from him , who I suspected to belong to the Gang .

Seven Years old , can not be guilty of Felony , whatever Circumstances , proving Discretion , may appear . If he be above Seven Years old , and under Twelve Years , and commit a Felony , in this Case , prima facie , he is to be adjudged not guilty , because he is supposed not of Discretion to judge between Good and Evil ; yet if it appear by strong and pregnant Evidence and Circumstances , that he had Discretion to judge between Good and Evil , Judgement of Death may be given against him . - At Abingdon Assizes , 1629 , John Dean , an Infant , between E ight and Nine Years , was indicted , arraigned , and found guilty of burning two Barns in the Town of Windsor ; and it appearing upon Examination , that he had Malice , Revenge , Craft , and Cunning , he had Judgment to be hang 'd , and was bang 'd accordingly .

Samuel Hayley . On the 24th of December , George Spurham came to my House , with this Hat on , and offer 'd it to sell , and said he found it in the Fields , but would not tell me where ; Hudson stood behind him , and I heard him say , he wish 'd he had never seen Spurham ; that he had brought him into a premunire , for he had robbed somebody in Hoxton-Square . They both ran away together , and left the Things behind them : They were both taken , and Mr Saltwell owned them before the Justice . Spurham . Hudson is clear , he knew nothing of it . Ann Saltwell .

December the 25th . William Blackwell . On Christmas-Day in the Morning , between the Hours of Twelve and One , I was going Home to Bruton-Street ; I had been at Smithfield to buy a Horse , and just by the New-Church in the Strand , there was a Woman standing ; I asked her what she stood there for at that Time o'Night ; with that a Soldier came up to me , and asked me for something to drink ; I put my Hand in my Pocket , and gave him a Penny : The Woman went down into a Night-Cellar , and fetched a Dram , and asked me to drink , but I refus 'd it : Two other Soldiers came up , and all three follow 'd me into Catherine-street ; two of them laid hold of me , one by one Arm , and the other by the other Arm ; one of them asked me , if I would not give them a Pot ; I said , yes , if they would go my Way . Then they all three wanted to lead me down the Street again , ( this was a little Way down Catherine-street . ) I told them I would not go that Way , so I turned away from them ; they whisper 'd , and turned to me again ; almost against Bridges-street , Bland laid hold of me round the Shoulder , and another took my Hat off my Head , but I can not be sure who did it ; then two Gentlemen came up , upon which I laid fast hold of Bland , called out Watch , and carried him to the Watch-House , and next Day before Justice Deveil . I am sure Bland is the Man that laid hold of me , because I did not let him go out of my Hand , till he was secured by the Watch . I think the Prisoner Brand is the Man who took my Hat off . John Bland . On Christmas Eve , about twelve o'Clock , I met the Prosecutor and the Prisoner , William Brand , together , by the Royal-Oak Alehouse in the Strand ; and at the End of a Street over against Somerset-House , I heard Brand ask the Gentleman to go and be a Penny towards a Pot of Beer ; he said he did not care if he did , or Three Half-pence , provided they would go his Way . When we got against Exeter-street End , I laid my Hand upon his Shoulder , ( I did not hold him fast ) and William Brand came behind him , and took his Hat off his Head , and run away with it , and then the Gentleman laid hold of me . I believe Fennell was forty Yards off at that Time . Q . Had you concerted any Scheme that Night to go about any such Thing ? John Bland . No , I never thought of any such Thing ; and I believe neither of the Prisoners . - I believe Fennell did not know any Thing of my Design of laying hold of the Gentleman . Brand owned he took the Hat off the Gentleman 's Head before the Justice . - There was no Whispering when the Gentleman parted from us the first Time . Samuel Huggins , Constable . On Christmas-Day in the Morning , between Twelve and One , I was sent for , and charged with Bland , for robbing Mr Blackwell of his Hat , and next Morning took him before the Justice , who committed him , and ordered me to go to the Colonel of the Guard , and demand the two-Prisoners whom Bland had discovered as being in company with him : And Brand owned before the Justice , that he took the Gentleman 's Hat off his Head , and that it was in the Savoy Barracks . Serj . Temple was sent for , and the Hat was found there . This is the Hat ( it was owned by Mr Blackwell ) As I was carrying them in a Coach to Newgate , Fennell said , that Bland did propose to them both , to take his Hat off , as he said , to get them a Drink . - As near as I can remember , these were the Words ; Let us go and take the Gentleman 's Hat off , to give us a Drink . John Forbes , the Beadle . On Christmas-Day in the Morning , Bland was charged by Mr Blackwell for robbing him of his Hat ; and said , that he laid hold of his Shoulder , while another took his Hat . Bland begged Pardon , and said . he would make a Discovery of his Accomplices , which he did before Col. Deveil , and confirmed the Evidence of the Constable . Edmund Murrel . I am a Watchman in Bridges-Street , and hearing Mr. Blackwell call out , Watch , I came running up as fast as I could . When I came up , I found Mr. Blackwell have fast hold of Bland ; upon which we carried him to the Round-house . He made a Discovery of the other two . I was present when they were brought before Col. Deveil : And Brand owned he took the Hat off the Gentleman 's Head . Fennell did not own any thing . Prisoner 's Defence . Col. Duroy . Brand has been about nine Months entered in my Company , in the First Regiment of Foot Guards : From that time to this , he has done his Duty , as a Soldier , well . I never had any reason to suspect his Honesty . He is a young Lad about 19 Years of Age ; and I hope , if he is favoured that he will take warning by this . Ever since he has been in my Company , he has been in the Barracks in the Savoy ; and by that I have a better Opportunity of knowing a Man 's Behaviour than out of them . They are not confined all Night there . He was present when the Roll was called over , but he might go out afterwards . Fennell has behaved well ever since he listed , which was in April ; and I believe him to be as honest a Man as lives : Extremely so ; a quite sober honest Fellow . Serj . W. Temple . Both the Prisoners always behaved very well , ever since they listed , which I think was in March last ; and I never had any suspicion of Rognery or Villainy in either of them . I carried them before Col. Deveil . Fennell cried , and declared he was as innocent as the Child unborn . - I believe they are as honest Men as live . Edw Raymond , Corporal . I have known Brand ever since May last . The Man always behaved extremely well ; and I never heard any thing amiss of him : And Fennell the same . They both belong to the Company that I do . Elisha Turner , Serjeant . I have known Brand about nine Months , and the other about eight Months . Brand has been in my Apartment , where he has been entrusted with Things of great Value . I never mistrusted him , nor ever missed any thing . Col. Duroy . I really think both their Characters are very good . This happened just on Christmas-Eve . I believe they were in drink . John Davis . I was with Fennell , Brand and Bland , Russel and Bryan , on Christmas-Eve , till between ten and eleven o'Clock . Russel , Bryan , and I , set out first to go home . Fennell came home soon after us . Fennell 's Name was called after I came to the Savoy . Brand lay with me . I went to Bed at 11 o'Clock , and he went to Bed with me . I can not say whether he went out afterwards . - He was in Bed with me when I waked the next Morning . - Prisoner . I lay with him 'till such time I got ready for Guard . Col. Duroy . I believe the Prisoners were returned as Defaulters the next Morning , tho ' they answered to their Names upon the calling over the Roll . Mr Cramphorne . Brand came of very honest Parents . He lived as a Servant with me three Quarters of a Year , last March was twelvemonth , and behaved always very honestly . I never heard any other of him . He was a drunken silly Fellow to be led into this Scrape . Mr Blackwell being asked , whether he was afraid [ a Circumstance requisite to make it a Robbery ] when one laid hold of one Arm , and the other of the other Arm : he could not say he was much afraid then , but was more so when one of them laid his Arm over his Shoulder . Brand guilty , Death . Fennell acquitted . 77 . + Ann Duck was indicted , with another Person to the Jurors unknown , for assaulting William Cooper on the Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Money-bag , Value 1 d. and 35 s. in Money , his Property , Dec. 28 . William Cooper . Dec. 28th . As I was going into Shoe-Lane , to look after my Waggon , I met the Prisoner in Eagle and Child Alley , between Shoe-Lane and the New-Market . She laid hold of me , and cried out for Nan , Nan came in a Minute . - Not this Nan Duck . There were two Nans . Then they both laid hold of me , the Prisoner with her Right-Hand , and the other with her Left . The Prisoner had one Arm round me , and dived with the other into the left Pocket of my Breeches ; and she pulled my Shirt out before she got to my Pocket . Then they both cried out for George , but George did not come . I cried out Murder , but no Soul came . - When she found my Shirt was not a Bag , she put her Hand into my Breeches Pocket , and took hold of the Bag . There was in the Bag 35 s. She got the Bag out . I got hold of the Bag as well as she : But she had got hold of the Money part . She gave it a Jerk out of my Hand , and gave it to the other Woman , and she run away with it . Then I takes fast hold of her . God gave me more Strength then , I think , than I have had for some Years . She cried out for George ; but , thank God , George did not come . I cried out , Murder , and dragged her quite down the Alley . And just at the end of the Alley stood three Men . I said to them , Gentlemen , I am robbed by this Creature , and beg your Assistance to help me to the White-Swan-Inn at Holbourn-Bridge , where my Horses were . Two of them would not . They asked , what I would give them . I told them , I would give them what Drink they would ; but as to Money , I had none . One of them said , he would take the Country Man 's Part , and he went along with me ; I never let go my hold of the Prisoner , 'till I came to the Tap-house at the Swan ; and there I gave him part of two Pints of Beer . I thanked him , and craved his Name . But he said , he dared not tell it me , for he should be knocked on the Head by her Bullies if he should . She was that Night carried to the Counter : And next Morning , when she came before my Lord Mayor , she said I was suddled , and that my Shirt hung out of my Breeches ; and that I took her up without any Reason . - My Pocket was then buttoned up , as it is now , that one would have thought it impossible for her to have got her Hand into it . - I looked in the Bag two or three Days before , and the Money was in then . I have had no Occasion to open it since , and I am sure the Money was in it . - I always lay my Breeches under my Pillow , so that no body could get to it . - I am sure the Bag was in my Pocket when she came up to me . - The Man that assisted me said , he lived in White Fryars . I enquired at 20 Houses , and could not find him . Prisoner . The Man came running down the Alley with his Shirt out , and said he was robb 'd ; says he to me , you are the Woman that robb 'd me , for I can find no Body else . I did not touch the Man . Sarah Basset . I went down into the New Market on Tuesday after Christmas-Day , to buy my Husband something for Supper , and I saw that old Gentleman come and pull the Prisoner up Eagle and Child Alley , in a very indecent ; Manner ; his Breeches were down , and his Shirt hung out , and he said , I am robb 'd , and you are the Woman that robb 'd me . He had hold of her by the Arm , and cried out Murder ; says she , you hurt my Arm , what would you have with me ; he said , she had robb 'd him , and he would give any Body a Dozen of Beer to go to some Inn with her . - He was hawling her into that Part of the Alley that comes into the Market ; there was abundance of Mob in two or three Minutes , and there was a Gentlewoman that came down the Alley , and said , Master , do not murder your Wife . - I saw their Faces very plain ; I took Notice of her , because she is a black Woman , and so the more remarkable ; and I thought it a little strange , that an old Man should want a Woman . - It was about a Quarter after eight at Night . - I did not see the Man till he cried out Murder ; I was among the other Mob ; there was a Lamp which he hawl 'd her up to , which was as nigh as the Candle is to you . Ann Phillips . That old Gentleman was in Eagle and Child Alley the Tuesday in Christmas Week , with two other Women . - Both fair Women ; one in a Cloak , and the other without : ( I keep a House , or my Husband does , in Eagle and Child Alley , next Door to Mr Pauley 's , an Alehouse-keeper , at the Sign of the Three Compasses . ) They were first under the Lamp ; and as the People came down , the Women mov 'd backward and forward , and the old Gentleman stood with his Back to the Corner : I only speak this to show that there were two Women with him , and his Shirt hung a little indecently out of his Breeches ; I had no Business to see what they were doing of , because it was immodest : I had a Candle in my Hand at my own Gate , and I had a thorough Sight of the Women , and I heard somebody say , Do not murder your Wife . Said he , G - d d - n her , I do not murder her . - You , honest Man ! can you deny these Words ? Cooper . Yes , I can ; I am sure I never said so . Phillips . Did not you ask me to help you ? Cooper . Why did not you help me then ? Phillips . Then the Mob cried , What 's the Matter , honest Man ? And he said , I am robb 'd ! I am robb 'd ! I will give you a Gallon of Beer to take her away to some Place ; where he said , I can not tell . - The Woman he was pulling up the Alley was a black Woman . - There were abundance of People , black-guard Boys and Girls : Her Arm looked very big , as if it was swell 'd . Q. to Cooper . Did you see this Woman in Eagle and Child Alley that Night ? Cooper . No , I wish this Hand may rot off if ! did . Mary Forrester .

Cooper . I am sure I never hurt her Arm . Townsend . I do not believe you did . - It was bound up from the Elbow to the Wrist ; she said to the Prosecutor , how could I clasp you with both Arms , when I am a Cripple with one . - She did offer to have her Arm unbound , but I did not do it . - She did not give any Account what was the Reason of its being bound up . - The People at the Watch-House thought it was bound on Purpose to deceive them . I do not believe there was any great Matter of a Wound . Prisoner . Doctor Lee gives me Stuff for it now : and when I was before the Lord-Mayor , I could not stir Hand nor Finger . Charles Pickfat . I live upon Holbourn-Hill , I have lived there all my Life Time ; and our Neighbourhood is become now so notorious , that we have more Thieves between our Parts and Deputy Nash 's , than in any Part of the Town : The Prisoner at the Bar I know to be a common Street-Walker , and has been so a great many Years . - Plying between my House and Fetter-Lane , decoying and seducing Mankind . Joshua Smith . I kept a Publick-House a little while ago , and Mrs Phillips , the Witness , who lives next Door to the Three Compasses in Eagle and Child Alley , and her Husband , frequented my House , and I never saw any Ill by them ; but I have heard a bad Character since : As to the Prisoner at the Bar , her Character is very vile , as bad as can be at all ; she is very notorious , I believe .

I believe she was in real Want , for she said , she came out of the Workhouse but a very little before . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 79.

Mrs Reeve 's sent for me , and I went before Justice Deveil , and I said the same there as I do now : I do not know the Prisoner , but I know I lost these three Books . She owned before the Justice that she took three Books , two of them were found upon her ; she owned she sold one of them for eight Pence , and another she sold for a Shilling : And when she came to sell the other , the Woman stopped her .

I went before Justice Deveil in the Morning ; and the Prisoner owned she took three Books out * of the Church , and that this was one of them : This is my Book . * Stealing any Thing out of a Church , is a capital Offence ; but the Prosecutors in this , and the former Trial , had so much Compassion on the Prisoners , as not to make that Part of the Charge ; which if they had , these poor Wretches must have received Sentence of Death .

Tobias Isaacs and William Waters were indicted for stealing Two Shillings and Three Farthings , the Money of Edward Hurst , December 29 . Mary Hurst . On the 29th of December Tobias Isaacs and William Waters broke open the Door of a little Room my Husband has in Newgate , and brought Jack Friday along with them ; they said they would null him if he did not come ; says my Husband , For God Almighty 's Sake , Gentlemen , what do you want ? Says Isaac , I will tell you what I want ; so he gave him a Push against the Wall , and took his Breeches from under his Head , and gave them to Waters ; there were two Six pences , and Twelve-pence Three-farthings in Brass , which was all the Substance we had then in the World . I went to get the Breeches away from him , and Waters stabb 'd me in the thick Part of my Thumb , with a Knife , or something he had in his Hand , and took a Cobweb down to stop the Blood ; and Waters threw the Breeches down on the Floor , and said , There , you Dog , there 's your Breeches ; but there was not a Farthing in them . Says my Husband , Lord bless me ! these Men will always rob me , so that I can not keep a Farthing of Money to myself . Waters . Was nobody else in the Room ? Mary Hurst . Yes , Peggy Girdler was there , and John Friday , whom you forc 'd in : You have broke open the Door , and robbed me before this . Isaacs . I hope , as it is a Prison-Affair , the Court will give Leave to bring down some of the Prisoners of our Ward ; for we can not defend ourselves , but by Prisoners . This is only a prompt-up Prosecution upon the Account of a Quarrel . We are inform 'd , Hurst is to have a Guinea for this Prosecution . Hurst . I am not promis 'd any Money , or so much as a Glass of Wine , or a Drink of Beer . Edward Hurst . On the 29th of December , when I went to Bed , I had two Six-pences in Silver , and Twelve-pence Three-farthings in Brass , but Copper is the proper Name , I believe . I clapp 'd a Pad . lock upon the Door when I went to Bed , because the Prisoners have told me , if I had but a Shilling in the World , they would have it from me ; but I happened to be worth two Shillings then : They said they would have Ned Hurst 's Prime , that is the Expression they made use of : When I was asleep , I believe I had slept about half an Hour , some People came to the Door ; my Wife waked me , and before they got in I was quite awake : The two Prisoners at the Bar came in ; said I , What do you want ? Says Isaacs , You Dog , I will tell you what I want ; so he push 'd me against the Wall , and took my Breeches from under my Head , and gave them to Waters , and he took the Money out , for I saw Water 's Hand in my Pocket , and he took out a Handful of Copper ; and my Wife laid hold of the Breeches , and he said , D - n you , you Bitch , let go , or I will make you ; and he stuck her in the Hand , either with a Penknife or the Point of a Sword , I can not tell which : Gentlemen , said I , you will repent this I doubt . G - d d - n you , you black-guard Dog , says he , if you speak another Word , I will stick you to the Heart ; or if you ever speak of it , and I hear of it again . He then threw the Breeches into the Room , but there was not any Thing in them . Isaacs . Did you make mention of any thing of this till there was a Quarrel between me and one of the Partners ? Edward Hurst . Yes I did , I spoke of it to the Keeper ; and a Day or two afterwards I wrote to Mr Akerman about it . - Jack Friday came in , but he did not meddle or make with any Thing : He came in because they threatned to null him , that is , beat him , if he did not come in . - There was Margaret Girdler in the Room , she lay upon another Bed in the same Room , because they did not agree in the Women 's Ward . Isaacs . Is there a Hasp to the Door ? Edward Hurst . Yes , you know there is , and you broke one all to Pieces . There is a Place to fix a Padlock on . There is a Hasp and Staples . Richard Akerman sworn . Q . Had you any Complaint made to you relating to the Prisoners ? Akerman . I do remember something of Mrs Hurst 's complaining to me of her Husband 's being ill us 'd ; I think I had a Letter about it . - I believe it is about three Weeks ago ; Mr Bold and I had them down about it , and put them into the Cells upon this Complaint , and that of other Prisoners whom they had used ill , as a Punishment for their Offences . Isaacs . Was I not confined in the Cells where the Criminals are consined ? And was I not there ten Days ? Akerman . Yes , I believe it was about ten Days . Isaacs . I was there eight Days before I had a Hearing . Q . Has the Room , that Hurst lies in , a Lock ? Akerman . I do not know whether it has now or not ; I know it used to have a Hasp , Staples , and Padlock . It is what we call a Duce-Room , for Persons who are brought from one Goal to another . Isaacs . There has not been a Staple to the Door this Year and half . Edward Hurst . I have a Hasp now on the Inside to put a Padlock to . John Friday . On the 29th of December , Isaacs , Waters , and I , went into Ned Hurst 's Room together ; as soon as they got in , Isaacs took the Breeches from under Hurst 's Head , and Waters took the Money out of them . When I came into my own Ward , Waters told the Money , and there was 11 d. in Half-pence , and for that we had two Pots of Gin and Small-Beer . - I thought the Door stood upon the jar - I did not see any Hurt done to Mrs Hurst , but she complained that her Hand was cut . - I am sure it was Hurst 's Money , because I saw Waters take it out of his Pocket , and did not put his Hand into his own Pocket 'till he told the Money . Margaret Girdler . On the 29th of December I lay in Hurst 's Room . I was undressed , and she was almost undressed . The Prisoners came to the Door , and were half an Hour , or three quarters , striving to open it with a Poker . The Door had a Hasp , and was fastened with a Pad-lock . The first Man that came in was Isaacs , and the next Waters . Friday came no farther than the Door . Says Isaacs , Let us see what Prime Hurst has got : And he took from under his Head a Pair of Leather Breeches , and gave them to Waters , and he blew out the Candle , and took the Money out . - I did not see the Money in his Hand , but I saw his Hand in his Pocket ; he stabbed Mrs Hurst in the Hand with a Knife . - Isaacs . How could you see what was doing there , when you must go the length of the Hall to get a Candle ? Girdler . I did not go any farther than to Jack Ketch 's Kitchin , as they call it . - It was Charity-Money that was given us : We are robbed daily and hourly . Mary Delabrown . I heard Isaacs desire Friday to go with him into Ned Hurst 's Room , and see what Prime he had got . Friday was very drunk , and did not care to go . And the Prisoners said , he should go with them . They would null him if he did not . I know no more of it . Isaacs . Was there any thing to fix a Pad lock to ? Mary Delabrown . I believe not : For I lay there one Night ; and Hurst told me , there was no such Thing : It was sastened with a Bit of Wire . Robert Watson . Isaacs always behaved well to me . I know nothing of the Fact . Jonathan Hatton . I know nothing of this Affair . - I never knew that Isaacs ever robbed any body . - I have heard say that he did . - Isaacs . I would sooner give than take from any body . Butterworth . Isaacs has behaved very well , for what I know . - He always used me with good Manners . I know nothing of this Affair . John Delabrown . I know nothing of this . - Isaacs has used my Wife very ill , in striking of her several times . Waters never used me ill in any Shape . - Both Guilty . [ Transportation .

But after some Time said , If I must tell you , I left the Street-Door open last Night , and found it unlocked this Morning . I told her , That must be a Story ; for I heard her bar it at Night , and unbar it in the Morning . I told her , I would send for a Constable : And then she said , If I must tell you the Truth , I am married . - My Husband lay with me that Night ; and he had a Friend who sat up in the Kitchin all Night by the Fire , and she was afraid he had taken it . She told me , she knew nothing of the opening it : But , if I pleased , she would go with the Constable to the Place where these Fellows were , and would get them apprehended .

And the Indictment farther sets forth , that they did utter and publish the same , knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited . Samuel Clark , Esq ; Secondary of the Court of King 's Bench . This ( the general Release ) was produced in the Court of King 's Bench , the Court had a Suspicion of it , and gave it into my Hand . - I marked it myself , and have kept it ever since . I think Herbert and Tigh both attended there . Herbert . I ask you , Mr Clark , Whether , upon taxing the Costs , Mr Stokes did not appear ? And whether I did not act as Assistant to him ? Mr Clark .

He did not come into Court ; he was upon the Steps just by the Door . - I never saw Phillips before now . - Mr Herbert has said , that since the taxing of the Costs , he was the Attorney , and the only Attorney . This is a Copy of the Record . I examined it in the Treasury . Mr Clark . This is the Judgment against John Tigh , and Eleanor his Wife . The whole , at the Taxation , amounts to 26 l. The Costs were taxed May 14 , 1742. John Burnford . I was present with Tigh , and his Attorney , and G. Frogget and his Attorney , at the Taxing of the Bill at the King's-Bench-Office and that Night we drank a Glass of Wine together : Herbert then appeared as Tigh 's Attorney , there was a Talk about a General Release , and there was a Motion made in the Court of King's-Bench , to know why this Judgment should not be set aside , on Account of this General Release ; after this was found out to be a Forgery , Mr Frogget and I went into Wapping to enquire for Phillips , and after a long Enquiry , we found him on a Sunday in the Afternoon , I think it was on the 30th of May , shaving at a Barber 's in Cable-Street , in Rag-Fair ; I knew him before , so I asked him whether he would not go and drink a Mug of Beer , and we went to the Hay field ; while we were there , Mr Frogget asked him this Question : Pray where was you on the 13th of May at Night , Phillips said he did not know ; says Frogget , was you not at such an Alehouse , naming the Sign , at Fleet-Ditch , Phillips asked why : Says Frogget , you can tell whether you was there or no , and he said he did not know but he might be there ; Frogget asked him if he had any Company there , and he said he believed he had ; Frogget said , did you see me there , and Phillips replied he did not ; then Frogget asked him if he knew him , or had ever seen him , and he said not as he knew of ; Look at me again , says Frogget , and see whether you know me or not ; ( this was in a publick Room , where there was a good Number of People ) then says Frogget , how can you be so great a Villain , to swear you saw me receive such a Sum of Money , when you never saw me : Says Phillips , I saw none paid , says Frogget , you have made an Affidavit of it in the Court of King 's Bench , it is a surprizing Thing , you should not know me when I have the same Cloths on , and every Thing just the same as I had then ; and Phillips said , I will say no more about it , I have sai d too much already . If you want to know more , go to Mr Adams , the Pawnbroken , in Faulcon-Court , in the Borough , and be will inform you of all the Transactions . - There was a Talk of a Paper that he signed , and the People of the House said it was a strange Thing , he should be guilty of such a Thing as to sign such a Paper , when he did not know the Man . On the 13th of May , when we came from the Master 's Office , it was so dark that he could not see to do it that Night , so he bid the Attorneys cast it up . Shearsmith was not there , Tigh and Herbert , and Frogget , and Goulder , and one Bladen , and I , went to King 's Coffee-House , by White-Fryers-Gateway , and there Herbert cast the Bill up once , and then Goulder , and they gave the Bill to Mr Bladen to cast up , while he was casting up the Bill , Tigh said he had no Money , pulled his Pocket-Book out , and said he had a Draught upon the Bank , but the Person that drew it was dead , and the Bank would not pay it ; Herbert says to Goulder , ( Frogget 's Attorney , ) What do you design to do in this Case , you ought not to be over hasty in making out your Judgment against my Client , and he said he could say nothing to it , he must take the Course of the Law , and said he did not know whether he should make out an Execution , or bring an Action upon it ; when we came from King 's Coffee-House , Frogget . Goulder , and I , went to the Sun-Tavern , in Fleet-street ; we drank two half Pints of Wine , and parted at ten o'Clock , Frogget and I came down Fleet-street ; the Bill was taxed on the 14th , Tigh said at the Master 's Chambers , that he had paid the Debt and Costs , tho ' he suffered the Bill to be taxed ; Pob , poh , says he , I do not value what you are doing , I have got a Release - I do believe Frogget 's Name to the Release is not his hand Writting , I have seen him write several Times . Herbert . Was Mr Stokes , upon the Taxation , before the Master . Burnford . He came in , but staid a very little while , and left you to go through the whole Taxation . Herbert , Tigh was there on the 13th , but he was not on the 14th . Court . You should be very cautious what you say , when People are trying for their Lives ; you said it was on the 14th , and that Tigh said he had got a Release , & c. Burnford , I thought it was Tigh ; I took it to be his Voice . - I heard such Discourse pass , but I will not be positive who said it . - I took it for granted to be him , as they were all standing together . Coun . Are you sure to the Day you went to look for Phillips . Burnford . It was on the 30th of May . Q . Where do you live ? Burnford . In Half Moon-Court , on Ludgate Hill . Q . What do you do for a Livelihood ? - Burnford . I officiate as Clerk to the Persons in the Fleet , and my Character never was impeached on any Thing . Tigh . He swears I was at the Master 's Office on the 14th , and my Attorney says , there was no body there but Mr Goulder , and Herbert ; ask him whether he does not find Money to carry on this Prosecution . Burnford . Upon the Oath that I have taken , I never was one Shilling towards the carrying on the Prosecution . Tigh . You have acknowledged that you have lent Mr Goulder Money . Burnford . Yes , I did so in the Office , but I had the Money again . Mr Goulder . - On the 13th of May I attended the Master for Mr Frogget , at the King 's Bench Office , on the Taxation of the Bill ; there was Mr Frogget , and one Mr Burnford , and Mr Tigh , Mr Stokes , and Mr Herbert attended : We staid at the Master 's Office till it was quite dark , and then Tigh , Herbert , Frogget , Burnford , and my self , and one Bladen , went to King 's Coffee-House in White Fryers , to cast up the Deductions made by the Master off the Bill . I cast the Bill up first ; one of them said to Mr Bladen , You are a Man of Figures , do you cast it up , and I believe Mr Bladen did ; and as the Costs stood on this Deduction , it came to 24l . 15s . I attended that Evening to have the Alligation signed , and we agreed to meet the next Night between 4 and 5 - Stokes staid but a little while at the Office ; he did not go to King 's Coffee-House - Stokes said to Herbert , I will leave the Taxation to you ; I will have no more Concern in it . Q What passed at King 's Coffee-House ? Goulder . After the Costs were cast up , Mr Tigh put his Hand in his Pocket and pulled out a Piece of Paper , which he said was a Draught on the Bank . That the Gentleman who drew that Draught was dead , and the Bank refused to pay it . - I think he said it was about 20l . - He said he was disappointed of Money , and had not Money to pay the Costs , and I think Mr Herbert asked me what Time I would give him ? and I asked Mr Frogget , and he said he would give him no more than the Law would allow him . Herbert said , It will be for your Client 's Interest to give him four or five Days . In the Walks I said to Herbert , I did not know whether I should sue out an Execution , or bring an Action of Debt upon the Judgment , and then we parted : Tigh , Herbert and Bladen went towards the Temple Hall ; Frogget , Burnford , and my self , went directly up the King 's Bench Walks , through Mitre-Court , to the Sun-Tavern in Fleet street , where we drank two Half-pints of Wine ; it was past nine o'Clock when we came from King 's Coffee-House ; and when we came out of the Tavern Mr Frogget looked on his Watch , and it was then about ten o'Clock . - There was no Talk of a Release then , and it was almost impossible that he should pull out a Release , when so many People were in Company , without somebody 's seeing of it . Q . What was done on the 14th ? Goulder . On the 14th of May , as I was going down Chancery-Lane , I met Mr Stokes , who wished me Joy of my Client 's having received his Money . Said I , I am very much surprised at it . I wonder he did not tell me . Says he , why he has given a General Release . Herbert , Frogget , Burnford , and myself , met at the Master 's Office by Appointment ; I am not certain whether Tigh was there or not . I told Herbert , that Stokes said Mr Tigh had got a General Release , and Herbert declared he knew nothing of it ; and yet this Release is all filled up by him ; the very Day of the Month is filled up by him - I had no Discourse with Tigh after that ; I always avoided their Company as much as I could ; I did not care to go into a Room with them . Q . Was you in the Court of King's-Bench when the Release was first produced ? Goulder . Yes , I was - Mr Tigh produced it : My Lord Chief Justice asked him where the Release was , and he took it out of his Pocket-Book , and said , Here it is , and it was handed to my Lord . And when the Court said it must be left there , Tigh said , If I leave the Release I have nothing to shew for my Money . Herbert in Court confessed his drawing the Release . Herbert . When the Bill was cast up at King 's Coffe-House , and handed to Mr Bladen to examine , did not he take 20 Shillings off that was miscast ? Goulder . No ; to the best of my Knowledge Mr Bladen 's casting up agreed with ours . Edward Owen called again . I know Mr Herbert 's Hand writing ; I have looked the General Release all over , and I verily believe all the Filling up to be of his Hand-writing : I take the Word Thirteenth to be his Hand-writing , I know it by the Turn of the T. [ Thomas Newton was then called to come forth and give Evidence ; he had been served with a Subpoena , but did not appear . ] Richard Sanders . Mr Tigh sent for me ( I believe it was about Oct. 20th ) to one Abel Cooks in St George 's Fields , and told me of his being cast in a Law Suit and that his Goods were likely to be taken in Execution , though he had paid the Money to one Shearsmith , who was dead at Norwich , and he wanted somebody to make an Affidavit that he was dead , and come into Court to justify it ; and would have persuaded me to have done it . I told him I took it very much amiss that he should ask me to do such a Thing , and advised him to pay the Costs . This , says I , is a bad Way of proceeding ; 't is Felony without Benefit of Clergy . - I met him afterwards in Westminster-Hall , and asked him what he had done ; he said he had taken my Advice . Mr Goulder . I have received abundance of Letters from Frogget , I do not believe this ( his Name to the General Release ) to be his Hand-writing . Prisoner 's Defence . John Tigh . My Lord , I am innocent of the Forgery , for I paid the Money to one Shearsmith , to satisfy the Judgment ; and if there is a Forgery , it must be done by him . There was a Suit in the Crown against me and my Wife , on Frogget 's Account . - I have Witnesses in Court to prove , that they saw Mr Frogget sign this General Release . Samuel Herbert . My Lord , as to this General Release , I did not publish it , and am no ways concerned in the Forgery : It appears to your Lordship that it was published by Mr Tigh . What I did was in conjunction with Mr Stokes . And if this can be alledged against me as a criminal Fact , I am sure no Gentlemen of the Law can be safe in what they do , if the filling up a Deed should subject them to a criminal Prosecution . I recommend this to your Lordship 's Consideration , and submit myself to the Court . Eliz . Davenport . I never saw Mr Tigh 'till I went in his Coach from Gravesend to Chatham . I had been to see one Mrs Green in Golden-Square . ( I live at Christ 's Church , on the other side of the Water , and go a Nurse-keeping and ironing ) And as I was returning home , I went to White-Fryers to see for a Boat ; and there being ne'er a Boat ready , I went into a Coffee-house for a Glass of Wine . I can not be positive as to the Day , but it was the middle of May : I saw the Prisoner at the Bar ( Tigh ) paying down some Money upon the Table , and there was a Man whom they called Shearsmith : I heard him say , For God 's sake follow Frogmill , and pay him this Money , for this Law will ruin me . - And I saw that Man go out while I was drinking my Wine . Q . What was the Man 's Name he was to pay the Money to ? Davenport . I can not tell justly ; it was something of - Frog : I saw the Man take up 23 Guineas and some Silver . - I am sure the Man 's Name that took the Money was something of Smith ; but I think it was Shearsmith . - I did not speak to either of them . - I thought I knew one of them by Sight , and that made me take the more Notice of what they were doing ; - and when I had drank my Gill , I went away : I think it was about 10 o'Clock . - Q . How long is it since you were acquainted that you were to come and give Evidence ? Davenport . I believe it is six or seven Days . Q . How came you to hear of it ? Davenport . I had been to see Mrs Green , and she asked me , Whether I heard any thing of a Forgery ? And hearing Mr Tigh 's Name , and that he was in Newgate , says I , I do remember a Coachman I went from Gravesend to Chatham with , whose Name was Tigh . - it was in the News ; she takes in the News - then I remembered I saw Mr Tigh at such a Time , and that I saw him pay a Sum of Money . - I had a Subpoena to come . Q . When was it you heard of this in the News , Was it Summer or Winter ? Davenport . It was since May last . - It was more than a Fortnight . - I believe it is three Weeks . - It may be a Month - or Six Weeks . - About three Weeks ago , I was at Mrs Green 's , and told her I saw Mr Tigh pay some Money , and she desired me to go to him in Newgate . When I came to him , he said , Did not I carry you to Chatham ? Yes , said I , you did : I was with Mrs Green , and she was telling me of your being here , and desired I would come and do you what Service I could ; and he begged , that I would come and speak what I knew of the Affair when he came upon his Trial . Q . When you were in the Coffee-house , did you say any thing to him , or he to you ? Davenport . Our Acquaintance was so slender , I did not care to speak to him . Thomas Hulbert . I was down at the Ditch-side on the 13th of May at the Shepherd and Goat ; I went in between 10 and 11 at Night , and called for a Pint of Beer : There was that Man Phillips , and one Jacobs sitting at a Table ; and Jacobs asked me , whether I would drink with them : I told them , I had called for a Pint of Beer , that it was late , and I should soon go home . I sat down over-against the Fire-place , by the end of the Boxes ; and I saw two Gentlemen come in : Said one of them , Mr Frogget . why want you take the Money Mr Tigh has ordered me to pay you ? Said Frogget , I will take the Money now , if you will pay it . And the other said , I will pay it now . And he put his Hand in his Pocket , and pulled out a Parcel of Gold and some Silver , and a Piece of stamped Paper : Then he called for that Man ( Phillips ) and one Jacobs , to come and witness it : Then Frogget wrote his Name ; then Phillips he wrote his Name : And then the Gentleman asked Jacobs to write his Name ; and Jacobs said , he could not write , so he made his Mark : After he had made his Mark , the Gentleman put a couple of Dots , and wrote his Name . - Jacob 's Name : and then Mr Frogget took off the Seal , and delivered this Paper to the Gentleman as his Act and Deed . Court . Call for Frogget ; look at him ; Is that the Man ? Hulbert . That is the Man : I am sure that is the Man . - I have known Phillips and Jacobs a great many Years . Q . What sort of a Man was this Gentleman you speak of ? Hulbert . A tall , pale Man , pitted with the Small-pox . Q . Had he his own Hair , or a Peruke ? Hulbert . He had a Peruke . - I do not know what Clothes he had on . Coun . You were in a Hurry to go home ; so being in a Hurry , you staid and saw all this . Hulbert . They did not stay above a Quarter of an Hour . Coun . You are very particular ; you remember the very Dots . Hulbert . Yes , I do . Coun . What sort of a Mark did Jacobs make ? Hulbert . It was a Cross , and I think there are two Dots on one Side , and two on the other . - Phillips wrote his own Name . Coun . Who signed first ? Hulbert . Frogget signed first , after him Phillips , and then Jacobs made his Mark . Coun . Was the Seal Wax or Wafer ? Hulbert . It was Wax . - I do not know who put it on . - I keep House in Bell-Alley in Golden-Lane . - I am a Leather-Seller by Trade . - I work for myself . - I never saw Tigh in my Life . Coun . Where have you been ever since this Paper was executed ? Hulbert . At home . Coun . Did not you make an Affidavit of this in the Court of King's-Bench , when it was so much controverted there ? Hulbert . I never was in the Court of King's-Bench in my Life . - They came to me about a Fortnight ago ; never before that . Coun Who wrote the Name of the Person that was to execute it ? Hulbert . What Name ? Frogget 's Name ? Coun . Yes . Hulbert . Frogget himself . Coun . How is it spell 'd ? Hulbert . I can not spell . - I can not read any Person 's Name but my own , if you would give me a thousand Pound . Coun . Then how can you say the Name of Jacob 's was wrote there , if you can not read Writing at all ? Hulbert . Well , if I can not read Writing , I saw it wrote . Coun . Then how can you be sure it was Jacob 's Name ? Hulbert . By seeing him write it . Coun . Look on that : See whether it is his Writing . Hulbert . If I was to be hanged , I can not make out any body 's Name but my own . Coun . You know Jacobs , When did you see him ? Hulbert . I saw Jacobs about a Fortnight ago at my own House . Coun . How came you to be so particular as to the Day you met the People ? Hulbert . I remember the Day very well , because the 13th of May was my Wife 's Birth-day . Coun . How came you to attend so closely to what was done ? Hulbert . Why , if a Man is sitting at a Table where any thing is doing , he must see what is done , unless he was blind . Coun . Did you look over it as they were writing , so as to know what it was . Hulbert . I look 'd upon it , as I do upon that now , [ a Paper in the Hand of a Person near him , ] but I can not read that if you would give me a million of Money . Count . How much Money was there paid ? Hulbert . I think there was about 16 or 18 Guineas , and about 30 Shillings in Silver . Frogget . I desire he may be asked whether I wrote my Name at Length , or in Short . Hulbert . I can not tell . John Bladen . On the 13th or 14th of March after the Bill was taxed at the Master 's , Mr Goulder offered the Bill to me , to look it over , at King's-Coffee-House , and there was a Mistake of 20s . and I set it to rights . - I never saw such a Person as Shearsmith . [ The General Release shewed him ] Coun . Is that Mr Frogget 's Hand-writing . Bladen . I have not seen Mr Frogget 's writing often ; it has a Simile of his Writing . - I can not say it is not his Hand-writing . Coun . Can not you say , whether you believe it to be his Hand-writing , or not ? Bladen . I shall say no otherwise than I have said . Mr Curtis . I am a Brewer at Rochester , Mr Tigh rents a Publick-House of me , I serve him with Beer , and have taken considerable Sums of Money of him . - I always found him to be a very honest fair dealing Man . [ Mr Curtis being asked as to his general Character , said he has heard a great many People say good Things of him , and a great many People indifferent Things . ] John Dickenson , I live at Rochester , he has carried many a score Pounds for me , and never wronged me of a Farthing ; I never heard but that he had the Character of an honest Man . Wm Haines . I live at Deptford , I never heard his Character called in Question in my Life . Thomas Hatton . I keep the George at Rochester ; I serve him with Wine , he always was just and honest to me . - he is not without Failings as other Men have . Samuel Bates , William Moss , Robert West , Henry Beeke , and John Wright , had all known Tigh several Years , say he has been always just to them ; and as to his general Character , say , some speak well , and some ill of him . Mr Bragg . Mr. Herbert has done Business for me 9 or 10 Years ; he always had a good Character , he lodged in my House 12 Months ; I am a Hatter , and keep a Pawnbroker's-Shop , in Smithfield . John Bladen . I have employed Mr Herbert as an Attorney , he has acted fairly and honestly by me , I never heard any body speak ill of him . Joseph Snell . I keep the Butcher's-Arms , at Cow-Cross ; I have known Herbert two Years , I never heard any other Character , than that of a down right honest Gentleman . James Skeen . I am an Attorney , and have known Herbert 11 or 12 Years , I have employed him , and he was always faithful to me . Herbert . Speak as to my general Character . Skeen . Really I never heard any body give him a bad Character . Mungo Martin . I have known Herbert 9 or 10 Years ; I have trusted him in some Affairs for me , and he always behaved honestly , I never heard any Body give him a bad Character . It having been said by the Witness Hulbert , that the Man that paid Mr. Frogget the Money was a tall Pockfretten Man , Mr. Bridock was produced to give a Description of him . Elihu Bridock . I knew Richard Shearsmith , in 1738. when he was Clerk to Mr Stokes ; he is a short thin Man , shorter than I am by near three Inches , and I am not 5 Foot 9 Inches , he is a smoothfac 'd Man , about 28 Years of Age ; I do not know that ever I observed a Pock-hole in his Face , o r any Thing like it , he is of a sort of a brown or fallow Complexion . Counc . Do you know that this is the Shearsmith they are speaking of ? Bridock . It is the very same Man , he is living - I saw him the 10th Day of November last , I am very well satisfied that he is alive now : I believe there is a Person in Court , who has seen him within these 14 Days . Tigh . Mr West , did not Mr Frogget declare that Mr Shearsmith is alive , and that he has kept him up these 30 Days , and borrowed Money to pay for his Keeping ? Robert West . ( call 'd again ) I lay at the Cock , in Love-Lane , last Night ; and Mr Frogget there said , he had had Mr Shearsmith in Keeping , 30 Days for a Witness , that he was in his Custody , and could bring him into Court ; and that he borrowed Money to pay for the keeping of him . Tigh . I believe he keeps him out of the way on purpose , to make a sacrifice of me . Frogget . I did say , that I believed my Friends knew where he was , that they had acquainted me he was living , and had been with them ; and that he would come into Court , if your Lordship would be pleased to admit him an Evidence against the Prisoners at the Bar . Q . Did he say that he , or that his Friends , had him in Custody ? West . He said he had him in his Custody . Frogget . I never saw him , I said my Friends told me so . Christopher Searle . Mr Frogget , to the best of my Remembrance , said , that he never saw him in his Life , and did not know him , but believed he was pretty sure of finding him , and that he should be obliged to be at some Expence if he was produced . Pris . Council . Mr Goulder , Do not you know that Shearsmith is in your Custody ? Mr Goulder . No , I do not know such a Person ; - I neither know it , nor have I heard it . Samuel Baker . Mr Frogget said he had Shearsmith in his Custody , and was to pay 30s . for the keeping of him . Frogget . I did not say any such Thing , I said my Friends had him . Baker . I understood it - he had him ; but he or his Friends that is the same Thing . Tigh guilty of Publishing . Death . Herbert , Phillips , and Adams , Acquitted . 89 . + Elizabeth Freeman was indicted for feloniously and traiterously murdering her Husband , Jacob Freeman , by giving him one mortal Wound on the Right Breast , near the Pap , with a Shoemaker 's Knife , of the Breadth of half an Inch , and the Depth of 3 quarters of an Inch , of which Wound he instantly died , Dec. 28th . She was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest , for Manslaughter . Wm Sanders . I am a Shoemaker ; I live in Seacoal-Lane ; Jacob Freeman 's Goods had been seized , and I gave him Leave to lie in my Room . On Tuesday in Christmas Week he had been out to carry home a Coat which he had to mend , and when he returned he was very much in Liquor ; as soon as he came up Stairs , said she , What have you done with the Money that was to fetch Mr Gent 's Coat home ? with that he damn 'd her for a Pitch ; then she called him vile Villain ; with that he slew at her , and pulled her by her Topping , ( the Fore-part of her Head ) and they had a Struggle ; he cried out immediately , Oh Will ! Will ! I am a dead Man , for I am stabbed . She had one of my Knives in her Hand , cutting a Piece of Bread . I jumped out of Bed and caught him in my Arms , and he died immediately ; but whether he run against the Knife , or whether she thrust it to him , I can not tell - there was a great deal of Blood : The Wound was just above the Pap of the Right Breast . She had the Knife in her Hand when he entered the Room ; this was the Knife . [ It was produced in Court ; the Blade was about 3 Inches long , and very narrow and sharp at the Point . ] Q . Did she shove her Arm , or make use of any Violence towards him ? Sanders . Not at all ; there were no Curtains to the Bed , and the Candle was burning , so that I could see very well what passed . Simon Snowd , Surgeon . At the Coroner 's Inquest , Mr King ( the Coroner ) did insist on the Body 's being opened , and the Churchwarden sent for me . I found a Wound penetrating into the Breast ; I examined the Thorax , and found the Cavities all filled with Blood ; there was a Wound , as big as that Knife is capable of going into , in one of the Ventricles of the Heart - It was impossible he should survive above 2 or 3 Minutes after the receiving of the Wound . Q . Do you think the Wound might be given by a Man 's running against the Knife , without any Violence from her ? Snowd . Really I can not tell what to say to that ; it must be left to the Jury ; a little Matter would push that Knife in , it is so very sharp : The Wound penetrated the Breast-Bone . Henry Francis . On the 28th of December , a little before Six in the Evening , I was sent for to take Charge of the Prisoner : she said she had done Murder in a Quarrel with her Husband , but did not know how she did it . James Townsend , Churchwarden . On Tuesday the 28th of Dec . I was sent for from Home , on an Outery of Murder . Francis , the Constable , delivered me that Knife ; the Prisoner said she had done Murder , and deserved to be hanged for it . William Sanders said then , that the Prisoner had killed her Husband ; that she went round the Bed to his Seat ( he is a Shoemaker ) and took up that Knife and stabbed him with it ; I never heard that Circumstance of cutting Bread , or falling on the Knife , till I came before my Lord-Mayor - I would have had three other Witnesses examined by the Coroner , but I could not get it done . I was abused in a very opprobrious manner , and so was the Coroner ; there were some noisy Fellows there , who minded drinking and smoaking , more than the Business they had to do - I did not contradict their Evidence , either before my Lord-Mayor , or the Coroner - he gave much the same Evidence then as he does now . Q . How came you not to contradict him , when he gave his Evidence so different from what he declared the 28th Dec ? Townsend . I did not know I had any Business to offer to give Evidence . Margaret Hart . I live in the same House ; the Prisoner owned that Night she had stabbed her Husband , and said that she must go to Newgate . Anne Higgs . The Prisoner said she had killed her Husband . What ! said I , you vile Woman , have you killed your Husband ? Said she , If he is stabb 'd , I stabb 'd him . You must take and send me to Newgate . There was nothing named of cutting Bread that Night the Mischief was done ; but Sanders said then , that she got off her Seat , went round the Bed , took up the Knife and stabbed him . I live in the same House ; when I was called up Stairs , she had stripped him naked , and laid him on the Bedstead . A little before this , Sanders said , that she had a sore Hand , by taking up a Knife to do him a Mischief . Jane Miller . I came home that Evening about 6 o'Clock ; Mrs Freeman owned she had killed her Husband ; she had washed him and laid him out ; she would have got away , but I would not let her . Court to Sanders . You have said now , that the Woman had a Knife in her Hand , and was cutting Bread when this Quarrel happened , some of the Witnesses say , that you said that Night , that she came round your Bed and took up the Knife ; was it so in Fact ? Sanders . They tell me I said so that Night , but I do not remember I said any such thing - She had the Knife in her Hand when he came into the Room , cutting a Ha'pworth of Bread which she had bought just before . As to the other Affair now mentioned , the Case was thus ; he had pawned a Pair of Breeches , and came Home vastly in Liquor ; she called him Rogue , and he gave her a Slap of the Face with the Back of his Hand , and made her Nose bleed ; she took up a Case-Knife , held the Blade in her Hand , and hit him on the Shoulder , and so cut her own Fingers . John Hill . The Prisoner is my own Sister ; she is a very industrious Creature , and really lov 'd him ; she is a mild , meek Creature . Sarah Prinn . I have known the Prisoner 7 or 8 Years , I was Servant in the House where she lived ; she was an industrious , quiet , and peaceable Woman ; he has spent 12 or 14 s. in a Night , and when he wanted Money , he would bid her go and pawn such and such Things , and she would only say , How can you desire me to pawn the Things , to support you in your Gaming and Drinking . Mary Norman . I have known the Prisoner upwards of 30 Years ; her Character is that of a modest , civil Woman ; she used to carry it very civil to her Husband . Eliz . Hill . She is a modest , quiet , well-behav 'd Woman ; I never knew her guilty of any outragious Behaviour . The Jury found her Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding .

After drinking a Tankard or two with them , I said I was out of Order , and had a Mind to go to Bed for an Hour , and accordingly I did go to Bed , and laid my Breeches upon a Table by the Window ; I had not lain above a Quarter of an Hour before I heard a great Noise in the House , cursing and swearing , upon which I was very uneasy ; so this Anne Bentley came to Bed to me ; the Key was on the Outside of the Door , so I desired her to call somebody to put the Key under the Door ; Anne Bentley calls the Prisoner , by the Name of Mary , so this Mary Wood came up Stairs ; there was a Candle burning on the Chimney-piece , and she whips the Candle out , and took my Breeches , which I saw her do very plain , and went down Stairs ; when I saw that , I jumped out of Bed , and got a Candle to look for my Breeches , and I found them lying on the Outside of the Door ; I put my Hand into my Breeches Pocket , where I had 30 Guineas and 18s . in Silver , and all was gone . I went down Stairs and told the Prisoner , Johnson , of it , and he sell a cursing and swearing at these damn 'd Whores and Bitches , as he called them , and desired me to be easy and set down till he went to see for this Mary Wood - but he could not find her .

Richard Slanton .

On the 18th of December I was in the Strand , and saw the Prisoner running along with a Scarlet-Cloak in his Hand ; he turned into Southampton-street : I made a Blow at him with my Stick , but missed him : I run after him and cried out , Stop Thief ; and a Watchman asked , Where is he ? And I said , On the Bedford Head-Side . A Chairman had stopped him before the Watchman took him : He had no Cloak upon him when he was taken , so he must certainly have dropped it ; he never was out of my Sight till he was taken . The Watchman said , he was a Thief ; and the Prisoner told him , he would learn him to take his Character away . Says I to the Watchman , Hold him ; I will see whether his Character is good or no . When he was carried to Mrs Bailey , she said she saw him come out of the Alehouse ; and he said , You lye , you Bitch , I have not been in the House To night . [ His having been in the Ale-house just before was confirmed by the other Witnesses . ] Joseph Smith , a Chairman . I stopped him , and the Watchman came over , and said he was a Thief , so I delivered him up to the Watchman . Prisoner . Was I walking or running ; or had I any thing about me ? Smith . He was walking with his Hands before him , he had nothing about him then . John Gager , Watchman at the Corner of Southampton-Street . The Chairman delivered him to us , I went into the Strand to find the Gentleman , who cried out stop Thief , and the two Gentlewomen challenged the Prisoner directly , and said he was the Thief ; he abused them very much for pretending to take away his Character , and would have charged the Constable with them , for he said he was going about his Master 's Business . T. Manning . I am a Watchman , and stand next Door to the Bedford-Head ; hearing a Cry of Stop Thief , I took to the middle of the Way , and dogged the Prisoner ; I found him two Doors from my Stand , walking , and he was fumbling about his Pocket , and I thought I saw him fumble something out of it , and I believe it was the Cloak , and that he dropped it down one of the Areas . Mary Sheffield . At 8 o'Clock on Sabbath-Day Morning ; a Chairman knocked at our Door , and said , Neighbour here is a Cloak in your Area : that is the Cloak I found in our Area , two Doors from the Bedford-Head , in Southampton-Street , Elizabeth Bailey . That is my Cloak . Prisoner . I have nothing to say , but that I get my Bread honestly by riding Postilion ; I rode Postilion to my Lord Fairfax , I went to see my Sister the Saturday before I was taken , and she kept me all Night . I was to have gone with a set of Horses to the Bath , but staying too long , the Horses went away without me . My Lord Cardigan would give me a Character for my H , if I was going into any Place . Guilty , Death . 100 , 101 , 102 , + Richard Stroud . Henry Stroud , and Edward Taylor , were indicted for assaulting Richard Caswell on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a cambrick Stock , Value 6 d. two Silver Clasps , Value 5 s. and 8 Shillings in Money , Dec. 28 . Richard Caswell . On the 28th of December , about a quarter of an Hour after 8 at Night , Richard Stroud knocked me down in the broad Place , by Castle-Street , and took 8 s. out of my Pocket . Rich . Mitchel helped me up , and then Henry Stroud knock 'd me down . - Richard Stroud knock 'd me down with his Fist , and Henry Stroud knock 'd me down with his Fist , and Henry Stroud took my Stock and Silver Clasps , then Richard Strode , Henry Strode , and Edward Taylor , went off together . Taylor was dressed in Women 's Cloath ; I did not know the Strouds , but Taylor I knew before . - As soon as I got up , I followed them to a Gin-shop . Mitchel went with me , and then Taylor came out in a Waistcoat , and said , if I repeated what had been done , he would knock my Teeth down my Throat ; there was a Man bid me go home , said I , they have got my Stock and Clasp , and have abused me ; then Henry Stroud came out , and presently after I went home . - I was afraid , because they had threaten 'd me . - I am positive to Henry Stroud , I took particular Notice of him , it was Moonlight . Richard Stroud I have seen since , I know he was one of them . Q . Did not you take out a Warrant , for a common Assault ? Caswell . Yes , I had a Warrant from Justice Chandler , and the Constable would not take it in Hand . Q . Do you know one Dyer and Doyte ? Caswell . I did not know them before the taking out of the Warrant ; I heard they were Friends . - I did not hear they were Thief-Takers . Q . What do you mean by Friends ? Caswell . I did not know that they were Friends , till I was told they knew such Things . Q . What do you mean by such Things ? Caswell . Serving of Warrants and such Things , as belong to the Law . Q . What Advice did Dyer and Doyte give you ? Caswell . They said if I was robbed , the Robbery ought to be put into the Warrant . Edward Mitchel . On the 28th of December , I saw Richard Stroud knock Richard Caswell down ; and I said to him , what is that for , he said if I did not hold my Tongue , he would give me ten Times as much ; and he fell a licking me cross the Back , and upon my Knuckles . - I did not see any Thing taken from Caswell ; but he said they had taken 8 s. out of his Pocket , and his Stock and Clasp off his Neck ; that Henry Stroud knock 'd him down the second Time , and that Edward Taylor was about four Yards off , in Womens Apparel , ( several of the Particulars mentioned by Caswell , were confirmed by this Evidence . ) Richard Dyer . I was before Justice Wroth with the Prisoners , Taylor , and Henry Stroud ; the Prosecutor said , they knock 'd him down , and they said they had been upon upon a sort of a Frolick ; and I believe there was nothing else in it : I do not think there was any Robbery committed . Sarah Sheppard said , she had dined at her Mother 's Dec. 28th . and they had a Mind to have a Frolick , and went to see a Show ; that Taylor being her Brother , they exchanged Clothes , she put on his , and he hers ; that the Barber 's Boy ( Mitchel ) riotted her , and called her Bitch ; that her Brother went with her from the Show to Mrs Mathew 's ( who is her Aunt ) to protect her from the Mob . Sarah Shepherd 's Evidence was confirmed by Mrs Matthews . Thomas Ivory gave an Account , that he was at his Door , and saw a Croud of People coming along from the Show ; that a lame Boy was knocked down by somebody ; but he does not apprehend there was any Robbery ; for if they were grand Thieves ( and he does not take them to be Thieves ) it was very unlikely a Robbery should be committed at that Time ; and that he never heard any Ill of the Prisoners . Sarah Buckle . Tuesday in Christmas Week , about Eight in the Evening , I was coming over this broad Place , and saw a Man come up to this lame Man , and knock him down - It was the Day after Boxing Day - It was a black , well-set Man , in his own Hair , [ This Description did not suit either of the Prisoners ] that knocked him down , and then he took him by the Collar ; with that he cried out , You will throttle me . I saw him take a Stock off his Neck , and put it into his Pocket , and then I heard him say , He has took my Stock , my Clasp , and my Money . - I saw five Persons in all , no more . Counc . How came you to come here to give Evidence ? Buckle . Because I heard the Lad had received Damage by being robbed . Q . When did you hear that the Lad had been robbed ? Buckle . I heard it one Day last Week . Richard Love , Thomas Kemp , Dorothy Champion , Mrs Prince , & c. gave the Prisoners an extraordinary good Character . All Acquitted . The Prisoners desired a Copy of their Indictment , and a Gentleman in Court giving an ill Character of some concerned in the Prosecution , the Court granted it . 103 . + Thomas Cummins was indicted for assaulting Samuel Bond on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Shirt , Value 20 s . a long Muslin Neckcloth , Value 2 s. a Cambrick Handkerchief , Value 3 s. and a Pair of Shoes , Value 5 s. the Property of Samuel Bond , Dec. 17th . Samuel Bond . On the 17th of Dec. last , I was coming down Snow Hill , from the Hand-in-Hand Fire Office , and near the Rainbow Coffee-House , I was stopped by a Man not yet taken ; there was a Man stood in the Foot-way , I said , Sir , let me pass you ; he made me no Answer , but in a Minute or two I was in the Middle of 10 or 12 Men : I had a Whip in my Hand , a Great Coat and Boots on . Said I , You Villain are you going to rob me ? The Man who made the Stop first , had a Stick in his Hand , which came up to his Chin , and he said , If you say a Word more , I will knock out your Brains . I said no more , but took particular Notice of the Man that fronted me , whose Breast was close to mine , and likewise the Prisoner , who was at my Left Hand , and another Person , who was at my Right : They were some Time before they could get the Things out of my Pockets , they were so fast in , and when they had , they walked gently up the Hill ; said I , You Villains you have robbed me of such and such Things . Then one of them said , Do you hear the Country Cull ? he says he has lost a Shirt . I went into the Rainbow Coffee-house , staid about two Minutes , and then went to the Brush-maker 's opposite to it , and told them I had been robbed , and said I would stay there a little , for I was apt to think they would come that way presently . I had not staid long , before the Prisoner and the Person who first stopped me , and another , who took the Things out of my Pocket , came by ; I followed them by the Door of the Three Tuns , they were robbing a Gentleman : I took hold of two of them , and said , Sir , if you will draw your Sword , and keep the third Man from me , I will secure these two ; but the Gentleman went away . The Man who stood in the Front , gave me a violent Blow on the Head , which obliged me to quit one of the Men ; I did not tumble , but it was with a great deal of Difficulty that I kept my Legs , and was again in the Middle of 10 or 12 Villains . I said , Gentlemen , I know nothing of you , I desire I may pass ; for I was afraid of my Life ; the Prisoner , and two others , stood in the Front of me a second Time : A Man came up , and said , Sir , what have you lost ? upon that the Prisoner and another Person run towards Field-Lane , and as they began to run , I run , and cried out , and Mr Clarke , who asked me what I had lost , got up with one of them , and was stabbed an Inch and an half in the Head . I went Home , and did not come out for three Days , I was so much out of Order from the Blow I received . The Wednesday following , just as I came out of Mr. Harris 's , on London-Bridge , I saw the Prisoner , the Man who was in the Front , and the other , who was on my Right when I was robbed ; I went back-to Mr Harris 's , desired him to go with me , we pursued them , and at the Bottom of Fish-street Hill I got up with them , one of them goes by the Name of Black Sam : I struck at his Legs , but could not reach them , but I came up with the Prisoner , and got him into a Fishmonger 's Shop . - I am a Carpenter and Surveyor to the Hand-in-Hand Fire Office , Q . This was very late in December , how could you discover a Person 's Face , and remember it five Days afterwards ? Bond . I saw him by the Light of a Lamp ; I think I am so sure of it , that it is not possible for a Man to be mistaken . John Clark . On the 17th of December , between 6 and 7 o'Clock in the Evening , I saw four Men a robbing this Gentleman ; they had got something from him ; the Prisoner is one of the Men , to the best of my Knowledge - I can not positively swear to him , but he is very like one of the Four : I went up to the Gentleman on purpose to assist him , and said , Why do you let him go , I am sure he is a Pick-pocket . Then he run away , and the Gentleman and I after him ; when he came near Field Lane , he said , Damn you I am at Home now . He went into an Alley , and I would not follow him any farther : I went about two Doors down Field-Lane , and was stuck with a Knife in my Head ; I believe I bled a Quart of Blood ; it was God 's Mercy , I did not lose my Life . Mr Cook and Mr Harris gave an Account of the taking the Prisoner , agreeable to what had been given in Evidence by Mr . Bond . Prisoner . I know nothing at all of what I am charged with , and hope to make it appear that I am innocent . Thomas How . I live in New Bedford Court , in the Strand ; I do not know either the Prisoner , or the Prosecutor : I was coming down Snow-Hill that Night , between 6 and 7 o'Clock , and that Gentleman said , three or four Men had hussled him , and picked his Pocket , and a Butcher , as I thought , said aloud , There is a Number of People passing ; if you had cried out , they must certainly have been taken ; and the Gentleman said , It was done in such a Hurry , that he could not have Time to call out . Bond . What Coat had I on ? How . The Gentleman had a white Surtout Coat on that Night . Bond . I am sure you do not know me ; I had a Coat almost as dark as this on . How . I get my Bread by my Pen ; I was bred to the Law : I am not a sworn Attorney : I do Business for one who is Agent to Colonel Paulet , and Mr Eades of Lion's-Inn . - I do not want for Money : I thank God I live as handsomely as any Body need to live . Thomas Burton . I have known the Prisoner 22 Years : I went to School with him . - I was with the Prisoner on Friday before Christmas-Eve : I remember it for a very particular Reason , I am sure : I called at Mr Wish 's , the Corner of Hanover-Yard , over-against Great-Russel-Street , in Bloomsbury , facing Tottenham-Court-Road : The Prisoner at the Bar , and another , brought in some Pork-Stakes ; and Mr Cummins ( the Prisoner ) asked me if I would eat a Bit : I sat down and ate a Stake ; I had not seen him for four Months ; and we drank , I think , to the Tune of six full Pots , and paid Sixpence-Half penny a-piece . We staid there till between eight and nine ; and just as I parted from them , by a Barber 's Shop in Monmouth-street , I made a little sort of a Slip , and hurt myself , so that I did not go out of my Room till the Holiday-Week : He was not five Minutes out of my Company all the While , except going into the Yard . - I keep a Chandler 's Shop in Peter's-street , the Backside of St. Ann 's . The Prisoner is a Vintner by Trade , and follows that Business I believe now ; he does not keep a House as a Vintner , but goes to Tunbridge , Bath , and other Places , as a Drawer or Waiter : I 've heard he was Apprentice in Fleet-street . Nicholas Hussey . I have known the Prisoner six Years : I was in company with him the Friday before Christmas-Eve : I went into St James's-Park to see the Gentlemen scate , and there I met the Prisoner , whom I had not seen for half a Year : We bought some Pork-Stakes , and went in to Mr Wish 's and had them dressed . I never saw the other Witness before that Time : We spent Nineteen-pence-Halfpenny , an d staid till almost nine o'Clock , and in Monmouth-street I took my Leave of the Prisoner . - I live with my Brother in Earl 's Court . I am a Printer , I have worked with several Gentlemen in London : I printed the Bishop of St Asaph 's Works in the Country ; I worked with Mr Hughes in Whetstone-Park , and with Mr Bettenham , and Mr Bowyer . William Selby . I lodge at Mr Goodison 's in Cross-Lane , Long-Acre , and keep a Hatter 's Shop . I have known the Prisoner six Years ; he used to buy his Hats of me : I believe him to be an honest Man . - I never had the Curiosity to ask where he lived . Elizabeth Kingston . I went to see Mrs Wish the Friday before Christmas-Eve ; she was going out to buy some Things which were necessary for her Lying-in , and desired I would stay and assist her Husband till she came home . About four o'Clock in the Afternoon , the Prisoner and another Person came in , and I dressed them some Pork-Stakes : I believe they continued there till between 8 and 9. Isaac Craven . I keep the Harrow in Salisbury-Court , in Fleet-street , - the Tap-house to Mr Bell 's Brew-house . - I have known the Prisoner upwards of six Years , and he always bore a good Character - He gets his Living by going up and down the Country as a Drawer or Tapster to Vintners at Horse-Races , or other publick Meetings ; when he is in Town , he lodges in Queen's-head-Alley in Shoe-Lane : I take him to be an honest , industrious young Fellow . Mary Rowe . His Wife , and he , have lodged in my House eight Years . I live in Shoe-Lane : They paid 2 s. and 6 d. a Week : His Wife is sick in St Bartholomew 's Hospital ; she used to take in Washing or Ironing , he goes into the Country as a Tapster , sometimes stays a Month or two in Town ; he has no Estate . All the Neighbourhood , I believe , would give him a good Character . Guilty , Death . 104 , 105. John Deacon and Thomas Blair were indicted , John Deacon for unlawfully and wickedly laying Hands on Thomas Blair , with an Intent to commit the detestable Crime of Sodomy ; and Thomas Blair , for unlawfully , voluntarily , and wickedly permitting and suffering the said John Deacon to lay Hands on him the said Thomas , with an Intent to commit the said detestable Crime of Sodomy , Oct. 18th . Robert Pert . I am one of the Constables of the Ward of Farringdon within ; there is a Court behind the Chapter-House in St Paul 's Church Yard , which is suspected as a Place which People of this Sort frequent . On the 18th of October , between twelve and one in the Morning , I was going my Rounds with my Partner ; when I came to this Court , I heard a Whispering : I went softly into the Court , imagining something of this Kind was transacting ; to Appearance , at first , I only saw the youngest , whose Name is Deacon , for he was full against the other , and seemed to hug round him ; his Breeches were down , and his Shirt appeared : I then thought it was a Man and a Woman , for the youngest was in the same Motion as a Man is when he is embracing a Woman ; they were so close , that if I had had the Presence of Mind to put my Hand between them , I could not have done it . I called out , and said , In the Name of God , what are you doing ? Who , or what are you ? They seemed to jostle before they could get from one another ; and , seeing they were two Men , I called out for Assistance : They were both of them with their Breeches down . When my Partner came , I told him they were a Couple of Sodomites , and he laid hold of them : Then I went and called the Watchman , and carried them to the Watch-house . I asked them , what they did there ? Blair said , he went to ease Nature . I think , said I , it is in a very odd Way . D - n you , Sir , said he , if I must tell you , I was at S - te . [ The Witness went up to the Prisoner to look at him ] . I am sure he is the Person , he has a long Beard on now ; I suppose that is to disguise himself ; he was well dressed and genteel then . As he said he went to ease Nature , I order 'd a Watchman to take a Lanthorn to see , and I went myself , and there was no such Thing . I asked him what he had to say for himself ? he said , he was a Gentleman , and Master of Languages , and I used him ill : He sent for some People to come to his Character , but no body came ; and the other had but an indifferent Character : So I committed one to one Compter , and the other to the other . I carried them before Alderman Calvert , and he examined them separate : I was present at their Examination , and they did not agree in their Accounts ; Deacon said he went to piss , and Blair said he went to sh - te . Blair said he never saw Deacon , but Deacon said he saw Blair , and that he went to piss , and said he would piss there ; and that Blair said to Deacon , he might , if he would . Blair begged of me , as he was going before the Alderman , that he might speak to me in private : Says he , It is in your Power to ruin me for ever , or to save me : Says I , I will say nothing but what I saw , and that I will upon Oath . Blair . What Posture was I in ? Was I not easing Nature ? Pert . He did make a Motion of squatting two or three Times when I first saw him . - He was not sitting down , he was standing up , shuffling to put up his Breeches . - I could see them perfectly by the Lamp , though they got to the darkest Corner of the Court . Blair . I will speak as modestly as I can . Ask him whether he saw the Flesh standing to this Abomination . Pert . I can not say any thing to that - I had no Light of my own , there was a sufficient Light of the Lamp - I was within a Quarter of a Yard of them when I called out , and then I drew back . Blair . I did not move from the Place where I squatted down , till he took me by the Collar . Pert . I did not touch him by the Collar . Blair . This one Question will be found material : I do not know whether that honourable Gentleman is upon the Bench that I was before ; I told him the same Story , that I was easing Nature , and this Gentleman made the same Objection then as he does now , that he could not see it : I said , Mr Alderman , what I am going to propose is not cleanly or decent , but if you will please to order any Servant to go along with me into some back Place , I will convince them that I put that into my Breeches , by his pulling me away in a Hurry , that I should have left behind me : Ask him whether I did not say so ? Pert . He did propose that ; but he might easily have done that in the Night-time , I should have smelt him in the Watch-House , if any such Thing as that had been then , for he sat close to me a great while . As he was going from the Compter to Guild-Hall , he said he hoped the young Man had not confessed any thing ; I told him I should not trouble myself with what he had said , he would hear that when he came there . Peter Line . The 17th of Oct. last was my Watch-Night ; Mr Pert and I watch together , and we usually go two or three Times round the Ward of a Night ; as we were going our Rounds , Mr Pert went into the Court behind the Chapter-House ; after he had been there some Time , he called out , Hip , Partner ; What 's the Matter , said I ; he said he had caught these two Chaps , so and so ; that this young Fellow , Deacon , was next to him , and his Shirt was out of his Breeches , they were so close together that he could not draw his Stick between them ; that he stood over them the best Part of a Minute , and then he called out , and asked them what they were about , and they said they came there to ease themselves . I took Blair hold by the Collar , and Deacon by the Arm ; Deacon was buttoning his Breeches at that Time ; Blair 's Breeches were down , and he said , D - n your Soul Mon , let me put up my Breeches ; but I would not let him , and brought him half way to the Toy-Shop with his Breeches down ; Blair would fain have got away , and if the young Man had endeavoured as much to get away as he did , I believe we could not have held them ; he sent to several Persons to his Character , one in particular was his Landlord , a Baker , in St Martin 's le Grand , but none came . Blair . Did not I say what I was doing of , and that you hindered me from doing a particular Thing ? Line . You did not then say so , you did afterwards in the Watch-House , and I went with six or seven Watchmen , and we looked all the Way we came , and you said , It is not there , it is on the other Side ; but there was nothing - we were all going to the Compter then - He did tell the Alderman , the next Day , that I had occasioned him to soil his Breeches - When he came to the Watch-House , he said he had been doing so and so , but he did not say any thing of that when we took him . Richard Wright , Watchman . On the 17th of October , as I was going my Rounds , about Ten o'Clock , I saw the Prisoner , Blair , in the Place where he was taken ; at half an Hour after 10 he was there , at 11 he was there , and at half an Hour after 11 , alone all the Times , and just after the Clock struck 12 , as I was calling the Hour , the Constables called out , and I run to their Assistance , and found this Blair with his Breeches about his Heels ; Oh , said I , you are the Man I have seen so often to Night ; he had a Handkerchief about his Head to tie his Hat and Wig on ; says I , I know you by your Handkerchief . Blair . It is impossible for me to disprove this now ; but as sure as God is in Heaven , I was not on this Side of St Clement 's Church at half an Hour after Ten . My Lord , that Sunday in the Afternoon , I went to the other End of the Town , to wait on some Gentlemen , and was in Company with several of them from between Three and Four till nigh Eight at Night , and after that had been in two or three Companies between Eight and Nine ; I was thinking of coming Home , and it was a pretty heavy Rain then , which obliged me to stay longer than I did design , and I went into a House in the Strand , called the Moor-Cock , to drink a Tankard of Beer in that Time ; with drinking Beer after other Liquors , Wine and Punch , it gave me a Looseness , which has occasioned all this Trouble and Ignominy , and I was obliged to go into a Lane in the Strand to ease myself ; as for the Watchman 's saying I was there at Ten , he is mistaken above an Hour ; when I came by St Bride 's Church it rained again ; I went into the Sugar-Loaf , and it was past Eleven before I got out of that House ; I had a Friend with me , who would have kept me longer ; said I , It is Sunday Night , and my Landlord is an honest , sober Man , and I keep him from Prayers ; and if there is a God Above , I speak sincerely ; and it is in the Presence of my great God , who sees me , I declare I had no more Thought of committing that accursed Abomination , than I have of blowing up this House ; and as to that Man , I did not speak to him , and I do not know , as I hope for Mercy from God , whether he is a Man or not : I was obliged to squat down in that Place , and had done it two Times by the Way before . Besides , I solemnly declare , that if I was one of the greatest Villains , or most profligate Wretches upon Earth , and had any Inclination that Way , I could not have committed that Abomination , I was so much in Liquor ; Do not you think I was too much in Liquor to have committed that Ahomination ? Mr. Pert . He was in high Spirits , not any ways drunk ; he talked very well . Blair . This Imprisonment has almost cost me my Life ; I have almost lost my Limbs , my Legs are swelled , and my Feet almost numbed and dead ; so that if I was to lie as much longer I should be dead ; as to being disguised , I have lost my Clothes and Linnen , or I would not have presumed to have waited on your Lordshipin this Pickle . Deacon . I went that Night as far as the Cross-Keys on Snow-Hill ; the Gates were shut up , so I made the best of my way Home again ; and coming through this Place , I stopped to make Water , and a Person came close to me , and said , By my Leave he must sh - t by me , and while he was there , I heard somebody coming very softly ; somebody cried out , What are you doing here ? I said , No Ill : Said he presently , What , you are two Buggerers here , I suppose . Said I , There is no such Thing ; and presently there came another Person ; I was so surprized , that I could not tell who laid hold of me - but they laid hold of me , and said I should go to the Watch-house , and I went very willingly . Mary Appleby . The Prisoner lived Fellow-Servant with me 22 Years ago , at Mr Rev e 's , at the Bank-side , Southwark ; he ever was accounted a very honest young Fellow : He lived lately , five or six Months , as a Porter to a Druggist at the Swan , in Bishopsgate-street .

John Cowden . On the 1st of January , about 11 o'Clock in the Forenoon , I went to shift myself , and found the Parlour Door wide open , and found my Velvet Cap lying in the Middle of the Floor ; I called to my Wife and told her ; she said we were certainly robbed ; I went into the Bed-Room ( a little Place behind the Parlour , just big enough for a Bed ) and I saw the Prisoner laying these Things down upon the Bed . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 108 . + Bryan Cooley was indicted for assaulting Joseph Emmerton on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Cane with an Ivory Head , Value 5 s. January 2 . Joseph Emmerton . On Sunday was se'nnight , in the Evening , between 10 and 11 o'Clock , at the End of Sheer-Lane , in Fleet-street , I went to make Water , and a Man slung me down ( he must have tripp 'd up my Heels to do it ) and immediately there was a Man on one Side of me and a Woman on the other , I had a Watch in my Pocket but they could not get their Hands into my Pocket , so they moved off with my Hat and Wig ; I did not see the Man or Woman move off with my Hat and Wig ; then Somebody , I can not say it is the Prisoner , it was a Man , got hold of my Cane and dragged me along upon my Back , about 5 or 6 Foot ; says he , What will not you let me have it ? My Friend happened to be coming by , and asked me , how it was that this Man fell out with me ; I told him , I supposed he wanted to rob me : - That very Man that dragged me forced my Cane from me ; there was no Hat nor Wig by me when I got up . Mr York . On Sunday , January 2. between 10 and 11 in the Evening , I was coming from Temple-Bar , and I saw the Prosecutor upon his Back , and the Prisoner , whom I very well remember , had hold of this Cane by one End , and Mr. Emmerton had hold of the other as he lay upon the Ground , and the Prisoner was pulling it from him with great Violence , but Mr Emmerton held it as fast as he could , the Prisoner dragged him some Way upon his Back , in order to get it from him , and before I got near enough to lay hold of him he had jerked it out of his Hand , and was turning about to make off with it , but before he could get into a Run I was close enough to collar him , which I did , and charged him with robbing the Gentleman : Says I , You Villain you have robbed the Man : What I ? says he , and clapp 'd the Cane behind him , as I believe , with an Intention to drop it ; but I took hold of the Cane , and then he held it pretty fast , and it was with some Difficulty that I wrenched it from him ; then I took him by the Collar and insisted on securing him ; presently a Woman came up and asked , What I did with him ? and an ill looking Fellow or two came up , and behaved in such a Manner that I thought I was in danger of of having him rescued ; and having an Oak Stick in my Hand , I was forced to make use of it in a resolute Manner , or he would have been rescued from me ; when I got him to the Sign of the Cock I shewed him into the Entry and secured him . - I am sure the Prisoner is the Man , he was never out of my Hand till I got him into the Alehouse . - This is the Cane I took from the Prisoner , and what I believe he took from Mr Emmerton ; I have had it in my Custody ever since . Emmerton . This is my Cane , which was taken from me . Mr York . I asked him at the Cock , What made him do it ? he said , He did not do it . - he said in general , I did not do it ; I did not do it ; but I am sure he is the Man ; I was afraid of the Gang that was there , I am sure they were very bad People by their Expressions .

I live at the Golden-Ball in Bell-Yard , by Temple-Bar ; the Prisoner has been my Servant about 3 Years , in carrying Bottles for me , and I believe him to be an honest just Man , I have trusted him to receive Money for me and he has brought it honestly and truly . John Mooney . The Prisoner is a poor honest Man who endeavours well for his Bread ; I have known him 9 Years , and I never knew any Thing of him but what was true and honest .

On Thursday Morning last , I went to see an Acquaintance at the other End of the Town ; I had drank a little more than ordinary ; and coming home at Night , I met the Prisoner somewhere about Holbourn-Bridge ; she picked me up , and carried me into a Bawdy-house in Goldsmith Alley in Holbourn ; she was to get a Bed for me , which accordingly she did , and I gave Sixpence for it , and the Prisoner went to Bed with me . I undressed myself all but my Stockings , and laid my Breeches under my Head on the Off-side : I had not been in Bed long before she put her Arm a-cross me . - She made a long Arm : I asked what she meant by that ; and she did not seem to give me any Answer . I had Occasion , soon after , to go to my Pocket to pay for some Liquor which we had , as we sat in Bed ; and I found that my Breeches were removed , and there was not a Farthing left in my Pocket . - I had four Guineas and some Silver , but I can not tell how much . - I saw the four Guineas after I was in Bed . - I was not asleep , I might be in a little Dose . - I got up immediately , and called to the Landlord , and told him I had lost all my Money . - The Landlord and a Watchman came up ; and there was a Guinea found in one of her Stockings . - Her Stockings were never off any more than mine . I thought she had a Guinea in her Mouth , but I ca n't be sure of that ; one Guinea and nine Shillings were found upon the Bed . - The other two Guineas I can give no Account of . James Deering . On Thursday last I was calling the Hour at four o'Clock , and a Man came out and called , Watch ! He desired me to come in , and said there was a Robbery committed - He said , there was a Man and a Woman in Bed : that they had not been long there before the Man missed his Money : I saw eight Shillings in Silver , and a Guinea , upon the Bed , and one Shilling upon the Floor , and one Guinea was found in her Stocking ; she had her Finger in her Mouth , but whether she swallowed the other two I can not tell . Prisoner . I was sitting down at Holbourn-Bridge , and that young Man coming by , I asked him for a Penny ; he said , if I would shew him where to get a Dram he would give me a Penny ; we went to this House , drank three Quarterns of Gin by the Fire-side , and two more after we were in Bed ; he fell asleep , and the Landlord came up , took his Breeches from under his Head , and gave me a Guinea ; he pulled all my Clothes off my Back . Parker . You had hardly any Clothes ; you had never a Smock on that I saw . Guilty of the Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 113 . + Mary Williams was indicted for assaulting Thomas Osbourne on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Hat , Peruke , a Pair of Buckles , a Muslin Neckcloth , three Guineas , and 26 Shillings in Silver , December 16th . Thomas Osbourne . On the 16th of December I was going along the Strand , and went into a Cellar to call for a Pint of Twopenny-Purl ; the Prisoner and another Woman were there : I staid no longer than the drinking my Purl , about twelve Doors from Drury-Lane ; the other Woman followed me , in order to pick me up , and the Prisoner laid fast hold of me in order to rifle me ; they both held me , and endeavoured to pull me down . - I called out , Watch : Instead of the Watch , one Richard Lucas ( who I have a Warrant against ) came up ; one of the three hit me a Knock on the Face , that stunned me , and laid me on my Back ; they robbed me of three Guineas , and 26 s. my Hat and Wig , Buckles out of my Shoes , and Neckcloth off my Neck ; two Soldiers stood at a little Distance while I was robbed : They took hold of the Prisoner , and carried her up Drury-Lane . About a Minute after the Women were gone , Lucas says to me , Friend , you are rifled . I know I am , said I . He ran up the Lane , and said he would get me my Hat and Wig : I went to the Cellar where I had the Purl , and he brought me my Hat and Wig . I described the Women to the Watchmen , and they said it was Mary Williams , ( or Welch Moll , as they called her ) and about a Week afterwards she was taken . I was sent for to the Watch-house in Lincoln's-Inn Fields , about five in the Morning , and the Prisoner confessed she was present , but the other Woman robbed me , and put the Money into her Lap . I went before Justice Deveil , she confessed the Thing , and desired to be admitted an Evidence . Edward Satchel , Constable . When the Prisoner was in the Round-house she fell a-crying , and told me she was taken up for a Robbery , and said , that as she was standing in Little Drury Lane , one Sarah Berry threw two Guineas and some Silver into her Apron , and told her , there lies a Fellow drunk , and she would go and see if she could get any more from him , but she did not bring any more ; that they went to the White-Bear , Covent-Garden , and distributed that Money between them , and there was 9 s. 6 d. a piece ; and they changed a Halfpenny into two Farthings , that every one might have alike ; and the Prisoner desired I would speak early in the Morning to Col. Deveil , that she might be admitted an Evidence against the others ; but I was obliged to wait on 'Squire Cook , in Lincoln's-Inn Fields , with two Pieces of Cloth , and so neglected to do it , which I am very sorry for : She said she was drawn in , and was very sorry for what she had done . When I spoke to the Colonel about it , he said it was too late , she had gone too far : I told the Colonel , I had given her some Hopes of it , but he did not take any Notice of it . William Rogie , the Beadle , confirmed the Evidence of the Constable , with respect to the Confession that she made , and said , There was one Richard Lucas and another Soldier ( I think his Name was Waters ) there . - She gave this Account herself , I believe , in Hopes of being made an Evidence ; she had some Hopes given her of it : The Constable , and I , and another , went into Parker's-Lane to see after this Lucas and Berry , whom she had impeached , and we could not find them ; she said that Lucas had two Shillings of the Money . John Acton , a Watchman , said , he saw the Prosecutor come out of the Cellar very drunk , and would have seen him Home , but he said he could see himself Home ; that he took the Prisoner about six Days afterwards , and agrees with the other Witnesses as to the Prisoner 's Confession . Upon the whole , considering there was no other Evidence against her but her own voluntary Confession , ( and that amounted only to the receiving Goods knowing them to be stole ) on the Hopes she had of being made an Evidence , the Jury Acquitted her . 114. Gilbert Barber , of St. Margaret , Westminster , was indicted for stealing 24 Bottles of Madeira Wine , the Property of John Williams , Esq ; December 16 . Acquitted . 115. John Russel , of St. Botolph Aldgate , was indicted for stealing nine Pound of Sugar Value 2 s the Goods of Persons unknown , December 11 . Acquitted . 116 , 117 , 118 , 119 . + Patrick Kelly , and Katherine his Wife , and Katherine his Wife , Garret Cavenagh , and Honor his Wife , and Honor his Wife , were indicted for that they not having the Fear of God , & c. nor weighing the Duty of their Allegiance , but being moved and seduced , & c. after the 29th of September , 1742. to wit , on the 1st Day of December , in the 16th Year of his Majesty 's Reign , craftily , falsely , unlawfully , subtilly , deceitfully , feloniously , and traiterously , did file , and with certain Materials , producing the Colour of Silver , did wash and colour two Pieces of Brass Money of this Kingdom , called Farthings , with Intent to make each of them resemble , and pass for a Piece of lawful Coin of this Kingdom , called a Sixpence : And the Indictment further charged them with altering the Impression on each Side of two Farthings , with the like Intent : And the Indictment did likewise set forth , that they , on the said 1st Day of December , did file , wash , and colour , two Farthings , with Intent as before . And this was laid to be against the Duty of their Allegiance , the Peace of the King , and the Form of the Statute . * * This being grounded upon an Act of Parliament ( of the last Sessions ) the Indictment must by express World being the Offence within the substantial Description made in the Act . At the Desire of the Prisoners , the Witnesses were examin 'd apart . John Graham . I have known Cavenagh and his Wife about 7 Years , and Kelly and his Wife about 2 Years ; I lived with Cavenagh on and off about 6 Years , he is a Smith , and in order to make himself be thought an industrious , hard-working Man , he often got up at 3 or 4 o'Clock in the Morning to go to work , and about 8 o'Clock he came to Breakfast , and then he made Shillings out of Halfpence , and Sixpences out of Farthings ; he files them and she rubs them upon a Leather , with Brickdust , to take out the Scratches of the File , and then he bends them , and rubs them over with a Paste , made of Burnt-Silver , Cream of Tartar and Aqua Fortis ; the Aqua Fortis dissolves the Silver , and then with the Cream of Tartar they make it into a Paste , that changes the Colour at once , and makes them look white [ the Experiment was shewn in Court ] we make use of common Salt to clean before we colour them . - Kelly is sometimes a Labourer , sometimes a Haymaker , and sometimes a Coiner . - I did not coin , but I have been concerned in defacing the King 's Coin - I was sent to Clerkenwell Bridewell the 16th of December , and on the 8th and 9th of December I saw Kelly and his Wife , and Cavenagh and his Wife , make Halfpence into Shillings , and Farthings into Sixpences , I can swear to twenty that they were at Work upon in those two Days ; they worked at his Brother Kelly 's House , I lodged there at that Time - When they were made , the two Women used to go and put them off among the Country Folk of a Morning . King 's Council . Do you know any of the Coin when you see it ? Graham . I believe I do [ there were two of the Farthings produced ] there is a great deal of Difference between the two ; I believe this is Kelly 's - it is not so clean made as Cavenagh 's Cavenagh has practised it a great deal longer than Kelly - Cavenagh used to call him a dunderhead Fellow , because he did not make so good Work ; I take the worst to be Kelly 's for that Reason - I believe this is Cavenagh 's [ the Box of Paste , and the Tools , ( two Files , and a Pair of Pinchers ) were produced ] I have known this Box these two Years , it was Cavenagh 's - these are the same Tools they all worked with , they were Cavenagh 's - Kelly lived in Church-Lane , in St Giles 's , and Cavenagh lived next Door to the Horse and Groom , in Cross-Lane - I can swear to this Leather , because I cut a Piece off the Corner , to put between the Vice and the Halfpence and Farthings - Sometimes one coloured , and sometimes another ; the Men generally filed , and the Women smoothed them , because they had not Strength to file them - Cavenagh has done it these 5 Years , and Kelly about 2 Years - I can swear to these two Sixpences - Graham and Laycock were concern 'd with them . Pris . Counc . What is the Reason that Cavenagh chose to make these at Eight o'Clock in the Morning , when it was Day-light , whereas he might have done it at Three in the Morning , when he would have been more private ? Graham . I shall come to your Question presently , if you please to let me ; for you are enough to drown 20 People : I told you he did it to make People believe he was a hard working Man . - I do not know that I ever saw him work at making these at eight o'Clock in the Morning . - I did not impeach first , Cavenagh 's Wife impeached before me , - I was sent to Bridewell for a common Assault upon a Quarrel . - I was in Prison 12 Months in the Year 1738 , for uttering false Coin . - I heard that Cavenagh 's Wife was to give in an Information against me ; and finding she had not done it , I took Care to do it before her : So I sent to Mr North , and made my Information . Cavenagh . How can all four be at Work at one Time , with two Files and one Pair of Pinchers ? Graham . I will tell you ; one filing , another smoothing , another pulling down , ( that is , filing down the Edges of them to the Letters ) another polishing of them , and a fifth may be employed in bending of them . Honor Cavenagh . How came you by those Files ? Graham . Why , they are yours , my Child . - I know them , because I have worked very often with them . Honor Cavenagh . He charged me before Colonel Deveil with filing Threepence off a Shilling . Graham . I have known her file three Halfpence or Twopence off a Shilling , when she has been scarce of Money , and mix it with Aqua-fortis , in order to colour the Money . [ Mary Laycock called in . ] Honor Cavenagh . Here is a good Witness a-coming ; she has been transported four or five times . Mary Laycock . All the Prisoners used these Tools , sometimes one , and sometimes another , as they wanted them . - I had these Tools from under Patrick Kelly 's Stairs ; and when Honor Cavenagh threatned to give in an Information against me , said I , What , are you like Jonathan Wild , first to buy me a Horse , and learn me to go a thieving , and then take my Life away for the Sake of the Reward . Says I to Sarah Graham , What do you think ? Honor Cavenagh says , she has put me in the Information , and does not think much to tell me so . King 's Council . Now shew us what they used to do with these Tools . Laycock . Suppose this to be Leather , as this is Paper , they used to do so , [ shewed how they filed them ] - I have seen every one of them do so , but the Women were most excused , because they had not so much Strength in their Arms ; the Women used generally to rub them upon a Leather to smooth them , and then rub them over with a little common Salt after they had bent them . - I a'n't cute enough to do it ; I wish I was . I never was Mistress of this Trade in my Life ; I never worked at it above a Month ; they used to rub them between their Finger and Thumb , thus - I saw all the Prisoners working at it in the same Room , within three Weeks before Christmas , at Garret Cavenagh 's Lodging , in Cross-Lane - I used to put the Sixpences off at Chandlers Shops , and Brandy Shops , and had a Groat in the Shilling for it ; I never would undertake any of the Shillings - Honor Cavenagh used to go along with me , for I never used to carry any more than one , for fear of being taken up ; when I had parted with one , I used to say to her , Here it is , it is flung ; she used to have a false Sixpence ready wrapped up in a Piece of Paper , and used to do so ( spit upon it ) and say , Here , take it , and God send you good Luck with it : The most that ever I put off in one Day were eight - I was not taken , I went to Mr North , and gave my Information voluntarily ; I do this for the Good of my Nation , the Safety of my Country , and the Preservation of my own Life , Sir . - This is Patrick Kelly 's Coin - I know it because it is a rougher Coin than Cavenagh 's , he is not so good a Workman ; this is one of Garret Cavenagh 's , I can almost positively swear to it - Cavenagh would work in the Day-time , to blind the World ; when he came home from his Work , and had got his Supper , then he went to work at this , that we might have them to dispose of the next Morning ; he began to work about 10 , may be 9 , 10 or 11 o'Clock at Night , when I lay with him - that is , lay in his House , not with him , Sir - These are made from King George II 's Farthings , the others will not do so well - They file them down to the Letters , and file the Britannia quite off - They file the Laurel and the Neck off , and leave a little part of the Head , and some of the Letters . Pris . Counc . . Can you take upon you to say these are King George 's Farthings ? Laycock . Yes , I can ; that is George the IId , and the Face turns to the Sun - I can not read , but I can make shift to write ; let me see it , and I will see whether I can read or no ; I am bad of my Sight ; I can write tho ' I can not read . Pris . Counc . . If you can not write , how can you read the Letters ? Laycock . You will be with your Cross-Questions upon me ; I can do both to my great Joy - Tho ' I can not read , I can tell the Letters ; the G is almost wore out , here is the E ; I can make shift to read and write , but I have a Mind to be upon Cross-Questions . Q . Do you expect part of the + Reward ? + A Reward of 40 l. is given by this Act for the Conviction of every Offender . And the Accomplies are pardoned . Laycock . No , Sir , God bless the Reward , let who will have it , I do not care - I took the Box off a Chest of Drawers in Patrick Kelly 's Room - I bought this Box for a Penny , and gave it them since Harvest - I came acquainted with them about April , to the best of my Knowledge . Garret Cavenagh . Ask her how long it is since she was an Evidence against Moll Cassalis , a common Pick Pocket at Rochester . Laycock . Ever since you were tried for the Murder of your Wife at Kilmanagh - I was at Rochester , but I never was an Evidence there in my Life . Garret Cavenagh . Was not you an Evidence for one Jane Wood , now under Sentence of Death ? Laycock . Yes , I did give Evidence for her as far as to what I saw , that they did threaten her - I answer to the Name of Lane , * which was my Father-in-law 's Name . * Mary Laycock , otherwise Lane , was tried in September Sessions , 1739 , for robbing her Lodgings . Vid . No 436 - When she gave Evidence in Jane Wood 's Trial she went by some other Name . Graham , Wife of John Graham . I have been acquainted with Cavenagh and his Wife about three Years , and with Kelly , since last Lord-Mayor's-Day . - I was sent to get 12 Farthings for 3d . there were six good and six bad ; those were reckoned bad that would not bear the File ; the good ones Mrs. Cavenagh took in her Hand to file , they were too strong for her ; so he took them , and filed all off one Side ; they filed the Head Side , down to the Letter ( V ) which brings them to the Bigness of a Six-pence ; I should not want an Estate if I had but a Quarter of what they have cheated poor People of ; I believe I can swear to 5l . a Week : Kelly 's does not go off so well as Cavenagh 's , so he puts off his Brother 's : Mrs Kelly had a strong Hand at Clearing , Mrs Cavenagh was the best Hand at Colouring ; I have seen Mrs Cavenagh colour , and Mrs Kelly colour ; I saw Mr Kelly colour but twice ; it was sometime before Christmas . - They are every ones Files , they all us 'd them ; but when the Act of Parliament took Place , my Husband was resolved to do no more , so I sold his Vice for old Iron ; these are Mr Cavenagh 's Files , I was with him when he bought them , - Mary Laycock seized these Tools , she gave them to me the Day before I went to Mr North ; she cried and said , Mrs Kelly said , She would hang the best Neck she had ; said I , You know best what you have done , but you may be even with them ; if you can lay hold of their Tools do , and bring them to me ; which she did ; she said , She would throw them down the House-of-Office : No , said I , do not do that , as they threatened to inform against you , do you go and make your Information : I carried the same Tools I had of her to Col. Deveil , and he gave them to Mr North , the Sollicitor of the Mint . Garret Cavenagh . How long have you known that Box ? Graham . As long as I have known you ; I can swear to their having this Box two Years and not wrong my Conscience . Mr. Hind produced one of the Counterfeit Six pences which he said , he had of Mr. Alford , a Distiller , by Clare-Market . Mr. Alford deposed , that he could not be certain that was the Piece he had of Laycock . Mr North deposed , that was the Piece he had from Mr Hind , and that the Tools which were produced , were the Tools Col. Deveil delivered into his Hand . Patrick Kelly said , He was quite innocent of the Charge , that he knew nothing of altering the Coin . Katherine Kelly declared , that she was entirely innocent , and that this was done out of Revenge for her sending Graham to Prison for an Assault . [ She shew 'd her Arm in which was a very deep and large Wound , whic h she said he gave her ] . Honor Cavenagh said , She had seen Graham and the others at this Work , but they never saw her ; that her Boy , who is about seven Years of Age , told her , He saw Mr Graham making of Shillings , and , that she peep 'd through the Door and saw Mr Graham at work , but could not see what he was doing of , that she thundered at the Door , and he hussled the Things away ; said she , Mr. Graham , so , you are at your Tricks : Said he , I can not help it , I have not a Farthing in the World , I hope you will not hurt me ; and that he pull 'd out his Tools and went to work again ; she said , that her Husband was more innocent than she , that he never saw them at work , that when she told Mrs Graham of it , she said , Her Husband was a Wig-maker , maker , and got his Living by that ; she replied , Ah , on my Shoul , he has got a better Trade than that , for he can make Six-pences out of Farthings ; that when she told her Husband of it he was very angry with her , and had beat and abused her , and went away from her , and said , he would never come to her again , unless she made a Discovery of them ; she told him , she would not do that , but she would never have any Thing to say to them again ; that she went to Mr North , that he desired to see her Brother-in-law the next Morning , and that he did go , that she was to go to him on the Saturday , but she miscarried after she had been with Mr. North , and was ill till the Friday following , and that they took that Opportunity and made themselves Evidences for the King . Mr North ( Sollicitor to the Mint ) . On the 16th of December , the Prisoner at the Bar , Honor Cavenagh , brought this Letter to me from Mr. Poulson , ( it is his Hand-writing , he told me he sent it ) I enquired into her Business , and she told me , she came to give me Information against several Persons , who filed Farthings , and made them into Six-pences ; I sent to Justice Poulson and had a Warrant made out against John Graham and his Wife , and Mary Laycock , I think he called her Lane : Kelly came to me and I asked him , where the Persons inform 'd against , were to be found ; he told me where to find Mary Laycock , and I told him , I desir 'd Honor Cavenagh to come to me in the Morning , and let me know where they were to be found : On Sunday Night a Messenger came to me , from Clerkenwell-Bridewell , to inform me , that John Graham was in there for an Assault , and desired to see me about an Information ; I apprehended that some Quarrel was the Occasion of their sending to me ; the Person that came from Graham , asked me , If any Person had made an Information against Graham ? I did not satisfy him as to that Question ; I told the Messenger , I would consider whether I should come or no ; I staid till the Friday following , and hearing no more from Honor Cavenagh , I thought it was Time to go to Clerkenwell-Bridewell ; accordingly I went to Graham , and he told me , he could make a large Discovery of Persons concerned in filing of Farthings , and making them into Six-pences ; I told him I would consider of it , and hearing nothing from Honor Cavenagh , I went to Col. Deveil , and he sent for Graham and took his Information , and Graham 's Wife and Laycock came to my House , and said , they could confirm Graham 's Information ; and their Information was taken , and upon this , the Prisoners were taken up - it was the Day that Graham was taken that Honor Cavenagh came to me and said , her Husband had beat and abus 'd her very much , and would not be satisfied unless she made a Discovery - She told me so that Day she made the Information . - I asked her afterwards , why she did not come to me again : She made some Excuse , but she did not talk any thing of a Miscarriage then . I asked Garret Cavenagh the Reason why his Wife did not come again , and told him she said he had beat her , and abused her , because she would not come and make her Information ; and he said , he knew nothing at all of the Matter . - They were not all taken at the same Time ; Garret was the last Person that was taken . - Kelly did not come to me to make an Information as to the Coining , but upon Honor Cavenagh 's Account , to tell me where those Persons were to be found . Mary Wiseman . Garret Cavenagh did not keep out of the Way ; he went about his Business as usual , and sent Word to Colonel Deveil that he would surrender himself . Garret Cavenagh . I would ask Mr Thomson the Constable , Whether , when the others were taken up , I was not in the Body of the Watch , and said , that I was one of the Persons in the Warrant ; and he would not take me ? Thomson . He did come into the Watch-house , and offered to surrender himself , and I said I knew nothing of him , and I would not take Charge of him . James Gough . Garret Cavenagh lodged in my House , and never kept out of the Way ; he used to come home two or three times a Day , to bring Subsistence to his Children . Samuel Lee . I am a Smith , Cavenagh has work 'd with me about five Months ; we have but one Fire between us : I work till 12 at Night , and he comes at 3 or 4 in the Morning , to be from the Fire against I come , and sometimes he works till 11 or 12 at Night : He has work 'd as hard as any Man in England , and kept his Family as well as any Body - He sent me to Col. Deveil , to know if there was any Information against him , and he said there was ; and said , if he came before him , he should be oblig 'd to commit him . Jane Gough . On Saturday before Christmas , Mrs Cavenagh miscarried ; she told me , it was upon the Account of her Husband 's ill Usage , and abusing her for entertaining these People . - I saw him strike her ; that is ill Usage . Enoch Wilton . I know this Garret Cavenagh to be a hard working , labouring Man . On the 10th of October this Laycock came to my House ; my Wife said , What do you do here ? there is the same Stairs you came up ; and my Wife took up a Candlestick , and said , If that Woman was to say this Candlestick is Gold , she would swear it . And Laycock said , G - d d - n my Eyes if I would not . The Council for the Prisoner objected , That the Act of Parliament is made against the filing and colouring of Brass Money called Halfpence and Farthings , and that these Halfpence and Farthings are not made of Brass , but Copper . The Council for the King answered , They apprehended the Legislature well knew what they did when this Act was made , that it is against filing or altering of Brass-Money , & c. and taking the Word Brass away , the Word Money remains ; and that they might venture to say , there is a higher Authority than the Legislature for using of that Word , and that is the Bible , and that the Language is not altered from that Time to this : It says , Cain was an Artificer in Brass and Iron ; and that at that Time there was no such Mettal as Brass in the World ; for Brass is not an Original Metal , but a Compound . It was the Opinion of the Court , that every Act of Parliament ought to be taken according to the Intent of it ; and that the Act mentions Halfpence and Farthings ; and that there is no other Brass-Money within the Intention of the Act of Parliament . The Jury withdrew for a considerable Time , and then found them all Guilty , Death . + + As the principal Witnesses in this Case were Persons of ill Characters , and this the first Prosecution late Act , the Jury recommended them as fit Objects of his Majesty 's Mercy . - The Jury did likewise commend Tigh ( whose Trial is in the former Part ) for that they believed he had been ill advised . 120 . + Daniel Wicket was indicted for assaulting Sarah Smith on the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her four Shifts , three Aprons , four Caps , three Handkerchiefs , and one Pair of Stays , December 28th . Sarah Smith . On the 28th of December I was going from London to Hammersmith , and about three o'Clock in the Afternoon the Prisoner overtook me by Tyburn-Turnpike , and said , Well overtaken Lady : said I , I thank you , Sir : Said he , Are you not Mr Smith 's Daughter ? I said , Yes : Said he , I know you very well : So we went together . There was a great Style in Tyburn-Field , and he asked me to hand my Bundle over for me : I said , No , I thank you , I can get over with it very well : Please to go along ; so he did ; and at the Style at the other End of the Field , he offered the same , which I refused . When I came to the Black-Lion at Bay 's Water . I met with a young Man , who was going with a young Woman , whom he was going to delude away , but another young Man came and took her from him , and carried her home to her Friends ; and the Prisoner said , that Man deserved the worst of Punishments , to delude such a Child away . When we came to the Bridge where the Black and the Soldier hang in Chains , there was a great Style , the Prisoner was foremost , and he wanted me to go over the Style first ; and there being a great Ditch of Water on the other Side , and the Wind pretty high , I was afraid to get over first ; I said , Pray get over first ; he would not : Said he , Do you get over first , and damn 'd me for a Bitch . When he found I would not get over , he hit me on the Side of the Head with a knobbed Stick which he had , and took me in his Arms and holl 'd ( threw ) me into the Bush-Hedge , which was very prickly : He said , he wanted to ravish me , and swore he would . I begg 'd him , for God 's Sake not to do it , and asked him why he should do such a Thing to a poor honest Girl , as I was , who never did him any Harm , or wished any . I struggled with him a great While , and then was forced to kneel in the Dirt in order to get up ; and I pray 'd to God to turn his Heart : Then he damn 'd my Blood , and said , if I made any Noise he would kill me . I got off my Knees , and then he holl 'd me on the Bush on the other Side ; then he came to me again , but he had not so much Power over me as he had on the other Side . Then he took me in his Arms again , and holl 'd me on the Bush-Hedge on the Side I had been before ; then he threw me on my Back , and damn 'd my Soul , and bid me lie there till he had done what he pleased with me . I prayed to God Almighty to be my Assistance , to get me out of such a Rogue 's Hand . I gave him all the good Words that ever I could , and yet he all the While damn 'd my Blood and Soul , and swore that he would kill me : Then he put his Hand up my Coats , and holl 'd my Clothes over my Head , and pull 'd out what he had : I wrung my Hands and was frightened , and prayed to God for Assistance , that such a Rogue should not have his Will of me : He swore he would ravish me , or have my Life . I fought with him a good While upon my Back , and was almost too strong for him ; then he kneeled upon my Stomach , and pulled a Knife out of his Pocket , and put it to my Throat , and swore if I spoke , or stirred , or made any Noise , till he had done what he pleased with me , he would cut my Throat . And I , Do you think I will lie in this Manner , and in Danger of my Life , and not make a Noise ? Yes , I will for somebody to be my Assistant . He put his Hand upon my Mouth , and said , G - d d - n your Blood , you Bitch , will you speak ? I will have your Life , or ravish you . I said , I will make a Noise and hollow as long as I have a Bit of Breath in me . So he put his Knife up again , and said , G - d d - n your Blood , you Bitch , as you serable with me so , and pray to God , I will take your Bundle away from you . With that he took my Bundle away from me , and run away with it to the Bottom of the great Grass Field , and damned me , and bid me come after him to fetch my Clothes ; No , said I , do you think I will follow you into that bye Field to fetch my Bundle , I am very glad I can get off so ; said I , I know you very well . So I made the best of my way Home , I do not know which way I got over the Stile , and when I came to my Friends , my Hair was all torn off my Head , and my Face bloody and dirty . When I went in , I had my Petticoat under my Arm , it was torn off in scrabbling with him in the Bushes ; here is the Apron I had on , it was made bloody with my Arm 's being torn in the Bushes ; when I got to my Unkle 's , they were quite galletted to see me , and when I sat down I swooned away : John Miles , a Neighbour 's Man , went with me to my Brother 's , and they went to the Prisoner 's House , at East-Acton , and brought him to the Constable 's House , and there I said he was the Man - It was a Clasp-Knife which the Prisoner had - It was about 5 o'Clock , and Moon-light , when the Prisoner attacked me , - I know Mr Bristow very well , but I did not meet him upon the Road ; I met another young Man upon the Road , whom I saw at the Constable 's House . Q . Did the Prisoner take the Bundle away from you with an Intent to rob you , or to make you come after him into that bye Field , in order to have his Will of you ? Sarah Smith . I can not tell that . John Smith . When my Sister came to my House , about 6 or 7 o'Clock , she said she was ruined for ever , for she was robbed of her Clothes by Jack Ragg ( that is a Nick name he goes by ) I saw her Apron and her Arms were bloody , and she had a Petticoat upon her Arm , but being surprized , I did not take much Notice : I went along with Miles and Cloudsly to see for this Man ; when I came to his House , I knocked at the Door , and asked if Daniel was come home ? they said , No , and asked me what I wanted with him ; I said I heard he was out of Work , and I could help him to a Jobb ; his Wife said he went to London in the Morning , and would not be at Home that Night ; we went out of the House , says John Miles , I will be hanged if he is not at Home ; we went in again , looked in the Room and under the Bed , and could not see him - we went into a little Orchard behind the House , and I saw him standing upright ; I laid hold of him and asked him , how he could rob my Sister ? he swore by G - d he did not know my Sister ; I told him it did not signify any thing denying it , for he had got her Bundle , and must go along with us ; he said , If I would let him go , he would give us the Bundle , he said he had left it by the Way ; I said that would not do , he must go with us ; then he said he would fetch us the Bundle ; he unlocked the Door of an Out-house , and delivered the Bundle to John Miles ; then he said , For God 's Sake let me go now you have got your Bundle : I told him that would not do , he must go with us ; so we carried him to the Constable 's House , sent for my Sister , and she was positive that he was the Man that had taken the Bundle ; then he said he would down on his Knees and ask her Pardon , if she would forgive him , and she said No ; how did he think she could forgive him , who , when she was down upon her Knees in the Dirt and Water , would not shew her any Mercy : Then he said , For God 's Sake , young Woman , consider I have a Wife and four Children ; she said , No , you shall have nothing but what the Law affords you ; and she gave the same Account the next Morning , before the Justice ; the Prisoner told the Justice , he called to her to take the Bundle , and said he run all the way after her , but could not overtake her . Sarah Smith being asked where the Bundle was during the Time of the Struggle , she said at first it was in her upper Coat , but that she was afterwards in such a Fright , that she could not tell whether he took it from her , or took it off the Ground . John Miles confirmed the Evidence of John Smith , with this Addition , that the Prisoner being asked how he could rob a Person who worked hard for what she got as well as himself , said , God forgive him , he had forsaken all Labour this Fortnight past , and they all said they were sorry for it ; that he farther said , he had not done it if he had not been put on to do it ; to which it was reply 'd , no body but the Devil put him upon it - that he owned he gave her a Push , and her Foot slipped , and she fell down into the Briers . Prisoner 's Defence . The young Woman and I came almost from London together ; when we came to Mr. Green 's House , there is a Stile , and she asked me to carry her Bundle , I put my Stick cross the Bundle , and laid it over my Shoulder , when I came to the last Stile , I asked her to get over , she was almost over , and I laid my Hand upon her , but I did not touch her Flesh , and she slipped on one side into the Briers , and got up again directly , and swore she would make me pay for this , and then went away : I had the Bundle cross my Shoulder all the Time ; I went to go directly homeward , and could not see her ; I did not know where she lived ; so I carried the Bundle home and locked it up in a back House , with a Design to carry or send it to her the next Morning . They say I went out at the Back-Door , I was obliged to do it ; for there was a Warrant out against me , and I could not stay within Doors , it was not upon the Account of the Bundle ; I said to Miles , Do you think I would offer to take her Bundle from her , as she knew me , and I know her ? and he cursed and swore , and said , Yes , I would ; and they said they would hang me . William Bristow . On the 28th of December , I was coming from Acton , about a Quarter after 5 o'Clock in the Evening , as I was coming along the Field , a little below Mr Green 's House , I met the Prisoner and a Woman along with him , but I can not tell whether I should know her again if I saw her ; the Man was foremost , her Hat blew off and she went back to fetch it ; when I past him , he said , Good Night Master , and I said , Good Night John ; he had then a Bundle or Hand-Basket , upon a Stick on his Shoulder - it was Moon-light , and light enough for me to see , I passed by them , looked after them , and stood still some time , and after she had pick 'd her Hat up she run after the Prisoner - when I met them I believe I was about 100 Yards off the Stile she speaks of - I could not be 200 from them , at the Time this happened - if she had cried out I think I must have heard it , because the Wind blew the Way that I was going , and if I had heard any Noise I should have gone back again - I did not perceive she had any Bundle , I think if she had I must have seen it , if it had been in her Cloaths - I think I can take my Oath she had none at all . John Smith . Did not you say , when you came back from carrying the Prisoner to Newgate , that he had no Bundle ? Bristow . I do not know what I said in Company , but what I have sworn to is true , Smith said , that the Prisoner declared , a Man he met persuaded him to rob her : said I , That is calling me Thief by Craft , because I was the Person that met him . - I did say , that if he had not said these Words I should not have troubled myself about it ; but as he called me Thief by Craft , I said , I would come in Favour of the Prisoner ; and I believe this Prosecution is carried on for the Sake of the Reward . John Smith . Did not you tell me you went along the Road ? Bristow . No , I can safely say , I did not say that , because I met a Man by the Field Side and staid and talked with him . Banks . Seakings , Arnoid , Reynolds , Whittle , Peggs , Freeman Prince , and Bristow , have known the Prisoner several Years ; some of them twenty all agree that his general Character is that of an honest Man , and always behaved well ; and some say , if he was clear of this they would employ him as soon as any Man in England . Sarah Smith was asked by the Jury , Whether the Prisoner had any Bundle ? she said , He had no Bundle , nor Basket , only his Stick in his Hand . The Jury then withdrew , and after staying out for an Hour , brought in a Verdict Guilty , Death . 121 , 122 . Matth.ew Conwon and William Bragg , of St Bottolph , Aldgate , were indicted for stealing one Copper-Boiler , Value 5 l. the Goods of Persons unknown , December 13 . Robert Cumming . There was a Copper-Boiler stole out of the Ship , called The Ann , which I was Mate of at Deptford , the 1st of October ; it was an uncommon Copper , it is near an Inch thick , it was a Copper Teach which they boil their last Sugar in , in the West-Indies ; we brought it over upon Freight ; the Prisoners worked on board the Ship three Days , but they did not work on board when the Copper was stole . John Davis . I live in East-Smithfield . On the 13th of December , I saw Conwon coming along with a large Piece of Copper upon his Back , Friend , said I , did you come honestly by it ? he made use of a great many aggravating Words , and said , He was going with it to Mr Whitlock 's , in Houndsditch ; then I thought he might be that Person 's Servant , and let him go ; I thought it was but a little Way to Houndsditch and intended to go and watch them , there was another Man had another Piece ; I watched them , and the Prisoners pitch 'd upon Justice Dennet 's Bulk and call 'd Coach , and agreed , for two Shillings and a full Pot of Beer , to go to the Seven Dials , then I thought I was right in my Suspicion , and acquainted Justice Dennet with it ; he sent for a Constable , we carried them both into his House and he examined , them seperately ; Bragg said , It was handed over a Ship 's Side to them , and Conwon said , He found it in a Street near Shadwell-Market ; the two Pieces of Copper appeared to be lately cut - they are now in the Possession of Justice Dennet - Conwon told me first , that he bought them , and afterwards , that he found them . Several appeared to the Character of the Prisoners . Both Acquitted . 123 . + James Price , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of Ann Peeling , about the Hour of Six in the Night , with an Intent to steal , Dec. 12 . But it appearing , by all the Witnesses , that they could , without the Help of a Lamp , distinguish one Person 's Face from another 's , it could not be Burglary . Acquitted . 124 Martin Stevens was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-House of Samuel Bishop , about the Hour of 4 in the Night , and stealing 4 Brass Cocks , Value 3 l. 1 Copper Hand , Value 2 s. and 200 lb . wt . of Lead , Value 24s . the Goods of Samuel Bishop , Dec. 10 . Samuel Bishop . About the 10th of Dec . I missed 4 Brass Cocks , about 70 lb . wt . and several hundred wt . of Lead , tho ' I laid but 200 lb . in the Indictment ; I advertised them , with a Reward , Mr. John Newton , a Founder , had bought these Cocks , and came and told me of it ; I saw them in his Custody ; two he bought of John Fasson , and two of Mary Wilson . John Fasson owned he bought them , but Mary Wilson is fled : There is one Causbee , who I believe is entirely innocent of the Fact , was prevail 'd upon to go and sell them . The Prisoner owned the selling of them , but said he did not steal them . William Newton . The Prisoner and I worked for Mr. Bishop ; I went to work there about the latter End of June , and on the 8th of Dec. last , about 4 o'Clock in the Morning , the Prisoner came to me and desired I would go with him to take these Cocks which we had agreed to steal ; I got upon his Shoulder , and went in at a Two-light Window over the Door , into the Still-house , which was never glazed ( Mr Bishop was then building a new Warehouse ) when I got in , I unbolted the Door , and let the Prisoner in , three Times , on the 8th , 9th , and 10th of Dec. and took away about 200 wt . of Lead ; we sold the Lead and two of the Cocks to Mrs Wilson , in White-cross-Street , I was present at the selling of them : The Prisoner told me that he and Causbee sold the other two Cocks . John Fasson . On the 8th of Dec. about 11 o'Clock in the Day , the Prisoner and one Caushet came to my House , and told me they had two Pieces of Brass to sell , and if I would buy them , they would fetch them . Stevens staid in the Shop , and Causbee went to fetch them . While he was gone , I enquir 'd where he lived ; he said , in Wood's-Close , and Causbee in Clerkenwell-Green : They asked me 6 d. a Pound . I told them it was coarse Brass , and I bought them at a Groat a Pound : There were 52 Pounds ; it came to 17 s. 4 d. and I paid the Money to Causbee , and that Afternoon I sent the smallest to Mr Newton , to know what he would give a Pound , and he sent me Sixpence per Pound . I sent the other , and Mr Newton said , that such Things were lost ; that he supposed they belonged to Mr Bishop , for he had advertised them . Mr Newton acquainted Mr Bishop with it . I went to Mr Bishop 's House , and he desired me to produce the Persons that brought them . I told him I would use my Endeavours ; and without much Difficulty I found the Prisoner ; he told me the right Place where he lived , I informed Mr Bishop of it , and he got a Warrant backed , and took him on the 28th of January , and on New-year's-day I saw Causbee go by my Door , and apprehended him . Samuel Causbee . About the Middle of December the Prisoner desired me to go along with him to sell two Brass-Cocks : We went to Mr Fasson 's in St John 's Street : I was the Agent ; I sold them for a Groat a Pound ; they came to 17 s. 4 d. I took the Money off the Compter , and gave it to the Prisoner , and Stevens treated Fasson with half a Pint of Gin . I never troubled myself in any such Case before in my Life . Mr Bishop . William Newton came voluntarily and made himself an Evidence . Several Persons who had known the Prisoner many Years testified , that he always bore a good Character . Guilty , Felony . [ Branding . See summary . ] 125.

Acquitted . * * There were two other Indictments against the Prisoner for Burglary and Felony in the same House : The Evidence against him was William Newton , who was the Evidence in the former Trial . The Prisoner produce a several Persons to his Reputation , and Mr Bishop himself gave him a good Character . The Jury acquitted him of all the Indictments ; and recommended Stevens , whom they had before found guilty , to the Favour of the Court . 126. John Ellis of St James , Westminster , was indicted , that he , after the 24th of June 1731 , to wit , on the 27th of December 1742 , did steal five Yards of Leaden Pipe , fixed to the Dwelling-house of James Scudder , against the Form of the Statute . James Scudder . On the 27th of December I lost five Yards of Leaden Pipe , which carries the Water out of the Fore-kitchen into the Back-kitchen , and found the Lock of my Door pushed back . John Robinson . I went into the Back-kitchen , found the Leaden Pipe was cut off and carried into the Fore-kitchen : I went down with two Neighbours , and catched the Prisoner behind the Back-Kitchen-Door , at the Foot of the Stairs . Says I , What business have you here ; it looks as if you had been cutting the Pipe down . He said , he was going by accidentally , and going to the Vault in the Yard , he heard somebody go down Stairs , and followed them to see what was the Matter : I looked upon his Hands , and they seemed to be all over Lead . Martha Abram , Sarah Dun , John Knight , and Martha Gwyn , gave him the Character of an honest Fellow . Acquitted . 127. Hannah White was indicted for stealing a Chimney-Glass , a Hand-Bell , a Pistol , a Fishing-Rod , a Brass Candlestick , a Piece of Green Cloth , 2 Pokers , & c. and a Book entituled , Dr Anderson 's Royal Genealogies ; with sundry other Books , Dec. 27 , the Goods of Thomas Thompson . Mr. Thompson . I have a little House at Weybridge ; my Study was broke open and I lost the Things mentioned in the Indictment , with several other Books . - There was a second Robbery ; this Book , Dr Anderson 's Royal Genealogies , was found among the Books taken in the second Robbery , which was the 14th of Dec. they cut through the Wall of my Summer-house , and threw out one hundred Books more than they took away ; I found them upon the Ground in my Neighbour 's Orchard ; they took away seventy Octavo 's , Quarto 's and Folio 's ; twelve Volumes of Rapin 's History , in Octavo , & c. after making the best Enquiry I could in that Town , I came to my Bookseller , and desired him to print Notes to give among the Booksellers ; a little while after , Mr. Taylor , the Bookseller , came to me and desired I would come and see some Books which he had ; there were Anderson 's Genealogies , and all the Books in the Indictment , except the first Volume of Rapin 's History , which was in another Place ; these are the Books I lost , and which I had of Mr Taylor . I believe this is my Pistol . Thomas Taylor , The Prisoner has been with me twice with Books ; the first Time she brought me Dr Anderson 's Royal Genealogies , which she wanted to exchange for a Family-Bible ; I shewed her one very hansomely bound , and she sold me Anderson 's Genealogy , for this Bible and 3 s. in Money , and she said , she had other Books to sell ; and on the 15th or 16th of Dec. she brought eleven Volumes of Rapin 's History ; all the first 12 Octavo Volumes , except the first , 3 Volumes of Shaw 's Bacon , the first Volume was not among them ; Pemberton 's View of Sir Isaac Newton 's Philosophy , and the sixth Volume of Bundy 's Roman History ; and I said , She could not expect to have the same Money for them as if they were compleat , and I would have had her have made them compleat , but she said , she wanted Money , and was willing to dispose of them ; I said , I would give her 2 Guineas and an half for them , and would buy the rest when she thought fit to bring them : She said , she lived at Mr. Wilkins 's , in Pye-Street ; I said , I would bring her the Money there ; she said , No , she could not do it ; I said , I must know whether you live there or no ; she said , I might satisfy myself when I would ; I told her , I would go along with her , and that she need not be afraid of her Money : She did not care for that , she said , she had no Occasion to trust me , and wondered what I meant by it , and said to the Man that was along with her , Put them into the Basket and carry them away . No , said I , Madam , I have bought them , and so I gave her the Money , and she gave it to the Man who brought the Basket ; and when I came to Tutik-Street , the Man went away , so that I saw no more of him ; said she , I will carry you to Mr How 's in Pye-Street , whom I lived with , and he will satisfy you as to my Character : Mr How was not at home , but Mrs How came and gave her a good Character ; and when Mr How came in , he said , he believed she was a very honest Woman ; but still she did not care to let me know where she lived ; she said , that she owed her Landlord some Money , and must not let him know she had received any ; I told her , I would be satisfied ; then she spoke to Mrs How , and they went into a Room together , and while I was talking with one Mrs . Waters about it , ( that I would secure her if she did not make it out , that they were her Property ) she was gone ; said I , Where is Mrs White ? they said , She was gone to the Little-house ; and so she made her Escape though those People heard me threaten her with a Constable : In 2 or 3 Days there were some Hand-Bills delivered among the Booksellers , to acquaint them , that such Books were stole : These are the Books I bought of her , they are very remarkable ; when Mr Thompson came to me , I went to Col. Deveil , and said the same I do now : I went to Mr How 's and asked a young Woman , who lodges in the House , where White lived , and she said , she lived at the upper End of the Willow-Walk , facing the Monster at Chelsea ; we got a Search Warrant and went there , and had Dirt flung in our Faces that we could hardly get in there , but hearing her Voice , I was sure it was the same Woman that I bought the Books of ; I found a Pistol there and the first Volume of Rapin , which matches with what was brought to me ; she said , I might search the House if I would , she owned she sold me the Books . Thomas Harris . I found there the Green Cloth that covered the Table , and a Chimney-Glass ; this was after White was in Custody - that is the Pistol that was taken out of the House ; I know it because it has been in my Custody ever since ; there was a Crack in it , just at the Butt , and it is filled up with Wax . Prisoner . I lived as a Servant with William Lefford , who lived at that House which Mr Thompson searched for his Goods , and they were my Master 's Property , as far as I knew ; and it is very unlikely that a Woman with a young Child should go to Weybridge , in Surry , to steal such a Parcel of Goods as Mr Thompson says he has lost . Katherine Hayes . I was in the House , and saw those Books delivered to Mr Lefford 's Kinsman , John , and the Prisoner and he went out together , and I saw the Money that John brought back , there were 2 Guineas , and 10 s. 6 d. in Silver , and he delivered it to Mr Lefford , for the Books . I saw Mr Lefford pay her a Guinea for Wages , the Day after last Christmas Day . Thomas Whiting . The Prisoner 's Husband kept a Publick-House at Egham , and had a very good Character ; I have been come from thence about two Years ; about a quarter of a Year ago I met her , and she said she kept a Man 's House somewhere by Chelsea . John Beauchamp was sworn , but appeared to be the Prisoner 's Husband , and therefore could give no Evidence . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 128 . + William Smith was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of James Jeffs , about the Hour of 12 in the Night , and stealing from thence 7 Pewter Dishes , 3 Soop-Plates , 28 Pewter Plates , & c. the Goods of James Jeffs , December 10 . 1741 . James Jeffs . I have a Country-House at Hampstead ; I left it the Beginning of Dec. last , I locked the Kitchen-Door when I came from it , and put a Padlock upon it , and when I went there , on the 16th or 17th , I found the Padlock off , the Brick-work was broke into a Foot and an half , and the Post of the Door , where the Staples go in , was cut like an Half-Moon , and the Door was cut in the same Manner , that they might come easy to push the Lock back ; I found all the Pewter and Goods gone out of the Kitchen , except a large Copper : I advertised these Goods , in order to come to the Knowledge of them , and I did not expect to hear any thing of them , till somebody came to be tried for a Robbery ; but last Tuesday two Men , one whose Name is Hambleton , came to my House in Town , and said if I would come to Justice Wroth 's , I might see a Basket of Brass and Pewter , and the Justice desired I would see if any of them were mine , and I found my Cullender , one of my Soop Plates , and the Winder of the Jack . John Smith . About a Fortnight before last Christmas was 12 Months , the Prisoner said to me , That House looks as if there was something in it , and we agreed to rob it , and at 12 at Night cut the Door and Door-post with a Knife , and we brought a great many Things out of the House , put them into a Bag , and carried them as far as the Long Field , and put them into a Pond , and fetched them the next Morning , before it was light ; he took away his Part , and I took away mine . - I never carried any thing to the Prisoner 's House ; I have seen the Cullender in Smith 's House , in Old street . William Hambleton . I am a Recruiting-Serjeant ; the last Witness enlisted with me in Col. Wolf 's Regiment of Marines last Thursday , and continued with me to the 10th of Jan. and then he brought another young Man , in order to enlist him : There was a Fire made for them up Stairs at our House ( I keep a Publick House , the George Alehouse , at Windmill-Hill ) they broke open a Cupboard there , and I found 4 Guineas and some Silver upon the Witness , so I carried him before Justice Wroth , in order to bring him to Justice , and he desired to speak to the Justice , and acknowledged that he and the Prisoner had broke open a Gentleman 's House at Hampstead , and made himself an Evidence , I went with a Search-Warrant to search the Prisoner 's House , and found the Cullender which is produced in Court , the Jack-Winder , and a Padlock Key in the Chest where we found the Soop-Plate , the Cullender was in a Cupboard upon an high Shelf . John Smith . This is the Key of the Prisoner 's Stable where he keeps his Horse ; these are all Picklock Keys ( there were 5 in the Bunch ) I do not know whether these were made use of at Mr Jeffs 's ; they never were in my Custody . Anne Lawrence . On the 1st of Nov . the Witness , Smith , came to the Prisoner 's House and brought a green Bag on his Shoulder , and desired him to let him leave it till he called for it ; there was in the Bag a Pewter Cullender , the Handle of a Jack , 2 little Dishes or Plates - it was a Cullender much of the Size of this , I can not swear to it - I was Servant to Mr Geare , the Corner of Dover-Street , I have been come from thence four Months ; I lived with one Watkinson , a Stocking-Shop in the Strand . - I am the Prisoner 's Wife 's Sister . Martha Boot . In November last I was at the Prisoner 's House a washing , Mr Smith was not at home ; John Smith comes in with a green Bag upon his Shoulder , and desired Mrs Smith to let him leave it . She asked him what was in it ; he said , something that his Mother had left him . Mrs Smith opened the Bag , and there was a Pewter Cullender , a Handle of a Jack , two small Dishes , or Plates , I can not tell which , some Knives and Forks , I can not tell how many . - I live at Richard Green 's in Swan-Alley , in Old-Street ; I am a Buckle-Maker , and work for Richard Green ; I can swear to that Cullender , but I do not know the Mark : I lived with Mr Young in Old-Str eet .
