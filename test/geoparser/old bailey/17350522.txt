John Becket , of St. Matthew Friday Street , Book-keeper , was indicted for stealing 500 Guineas , the Money of John Gibson , December 27 . John Gibson ( the Hereford Carrier . ) On Sunday the twenty first or twenty second of December , I receiv 'd 500 Guineas of - Clayton , Esq ; Receiver General of the County of Hereford , to carry in my Waggon to London . The Money was sealed up in a Bag , and so delivered to my Wife who locked it up . At night , when we were packing the Goods in the Waggon , Tom , says I , to my Brother , Fetch the Bag of Money . My Wife came out and gave it him and the Seal was not broke . He and she roll 'd some Straw round it and put it into an old Pair of Leather Saddle Bags . They roll 'd more Straw round the Saddle Bags , and then they were put into a small Pack of Goods and corded up , and this Pack was put into the Waggon , towards the Fore-end . The Waggon was loaded about eleven at Night , and about twelve it set out for London , My Brother Thomas went with it , but I did not go my self - On the Monday sennight , my Son In-law , William Mountain ( the Monmouth Carrier ) came and told me that the Money was lost . My Waggon inns at the Saracen 's Head in Friday Street , where the Prisoner has been for some Years my Book-keeper . Prisoner . Did you not charge others ? J. Gibson . I charged John Holden and Charles Airs , two of the Porters who unloaded the Waggon at the Inn . Prisoner . Was there any Passengers in the Waggon ? J. Gibson . Yes ; But I connot say how many . P. Council . Did not you send a Bill of Parcels to the Prisoner ? J. Gibson . Yes ; for it is a usual thing . P. Council . Among the other Particulars in that Bill , Did you mention this Money ? J. Gibson . No ; for I do n't think it proper . Prisoner . Did you not in November last send me a Bill of Parcels , with advice of a parcel of Money that was coming ? J. Gibson . I might do so , for I have done it sometimes , but have oftner omitted it . Thomas Gibson . I packed up the Money in the Waggon , and set out with it for London about twelve on Sunday Night , and am sure the Money was never stir 'd till we came to Town , which was on the Friday following . For though there might be Passengers in the Waggon , yet they could not come at the Pack where the Money was , because there was a Quantity of Boxes and other things loaded upon , and on each side of it . And where we lay on the Road a Man had so much a Night for watching . And when we came into the Inn-Yard ( in Friday Street ) I am sure nothing had been removed . I did not stay to see the Waggon unloaded , but being tired , I left that to the care of the Prisoner and his Porters ; and not thinking of the Money , I went into the Tap-house where I staid two or three Hours . Then the Prisoner came to me , and asked me about a little Parcel which I had taken up by the way . I have searched the Bags , says he , and it is not there , for there is nothing but Straw in 'em . - Nothing but Straw in 'em. ? says I , in great Surprise , for then I thought of the Money - Sure you must be mistaken . I went into the Ware-house and found the Bags lying under his Desk , I searched them but there was none of the Money . The Porters were all gone . But when they came again next Morning , they denyed that they knew any thing of the Money . Charles Aires ( one of them ) said that he found the Saddle Bags at the bottom of the Pack , and thought they had been an old pair of Boots and so he delivered them to the next Man . For their Method is , to unload the Goods by the Waggon side , and deliver every Parcel single , to the Book-keeper , who sits in the Ware-house to take an account of them . Prisoner . Were none of the Goods taken out in the Journey ? T. Gibson . We always have Way-Goods , as we call them , but these we put at the Tail of the Waggon . William Mountain . Being acquainted with the Prisoner , on Sunday the twenty second of March , I fell into talk about this Money , and I said it was hard he could not find out who was concern 'd in taking it . He said he had done all that he could , and more than any body was aware of : And that he had heard there was two Men and a Woman concern 'd . I asked who they were . He said he could describe them , but did not think it proper ; and that in a little time a Man would bring a Woman to Confession ; and I should see some Person in Goal before the matter all came out . Prisoner . Did not I tell you at the same time how I came by this Intelligence ? that I had it from the cunning Man at Wickham in Buckinghamshire ; and did not John Gibson himself cunjure for the Thief , with the Book and Key ? W. Mountain . John Gibson and the Prisoner proposed to go to Wickham to enquire after the cunning Man , and I went with them . James Fry . At the latter end of March , Gibson charged a Constable with the Prisoner . The Prisoner desired him to have patience and not send him to Goal , for before the end of next Month , he would have all his Money again . Council . Aye , if the cunning Man spoke Truth . Fry . I believe he might say that the cunning Man told him so . Edward Rustel . On Friday Night about a Fortnight before the Money was found in the Prisoner 's House - Council . What Money ? The 500 Guineas that Gibson had lost ? Rustel . I can not say as to that , but being in the Saracen 's Head Inn Yard , I heard Gibson say to the Prisoner , Do n't ruin me quite , let me have but half , or if that is too much , send me but 100 Guineas in a Box by any Messenger , and I 'll take it without asking any Questions . The Prisoner answered , If you expect to have your Money again , you ought not to speak of it in a publick Yard but in a private Room . Then Gibson went away ; the Prisoner said to me , I had rather quarrel with a Man of 100 a Year , than with my Master , because I have served him so long . Mary Jones . The Prisoner 's Wife lodges up one Pair of Stairs , and I lodge up two Pair in the same House . Between Christmas Day and New Year 's Day , as I was going down for a Pail of Water , she call 'd me into her Room , and said she 'd shew me something to grease my Eyes with . So she went into a Closer , and took out a great Bag of Money and pour 'd it into her Lap . She said there was about 300 Pound . It was all Gold , and she gave some of it to her Child to play with . I asked her whose it was ? She said it was a Merchants , and her Husband was to pay it all away for him in a little time . I am glad of that , says I , for I have got a Pad-lock on my Door , and therefore if any Rogues should hear of so much Money in the House , they 'll think its in my Room , and so I may be knock 'd on the Head . My Husband coming home to Dinner , Edad she calls him in and shews him this Gold ; but he loves to have me keep at home , and so says he , What a-pox do ye do out of your own Room ? I went out a Nursing , and when I came home again the Prisoner 's Wife said to me Ah , pox o ' your Pad-lock ! the Money 's all gone . Osborn Jones . I came home to Tinner ant wass coing into my own Room , put the Prissoner 's Wife callt to me and sait Here iss your coot Oman . So I hust her a pit , and ask her why a Tiffel she coud n't keep in her own Hapitation when I wanted my Tinner . So the Prissoners Wife prought out a pag with a crate teal of coolt in it . There was a crate many Pieces , a crate teal pigger as Guineas . Council . This could not be the Money that Gibson lost , for that was all in Guineas . Osborn Jones . Ant she pickt out fourteen or fifteen of them crate Pieces , and kafe 'em to the Chilt to truntle apout the Room . Where a Cots Name , says I , did you ket all this Money ? O says she , It is none of ours , put my Uspant is to pay it away for a Merchant . The Prisoner 's Defence . Charles Airs . I help 'd to unload the Waggon . Stephen Leach , and I open 'd the Pack . I took out the Leather Bags which lay at the bottom , and said , I thought they were Boots ; No says Leach , They are Saddle Bags . I gave them to Goddard , who gave them to the Prisoner , who search 'd them , but found nothing in them but a Wad of Straw . They were not fastned at top , and at each end of each Bag there was a Hole big enough to thrust ones Fist in . This was confirm 'd by Stephen Leach . The Prisoner had a very good Character given him and the Jury acquitted him . 2. Mary Manwaring , was indicted for stealing a Silver Spoon the Goods of Henry Pennyman , March 3 . Guilty .

On Easter Tuesday , going down by the side of a thick set Hedge , I saw two Gentlemen looking thro ' the Hedge , Pray what 's the Matter says I . They answer 'd , there 's a Man beating a Woman unmercifully . I did not see him beat her , but going farther I heard her say , Ye Villain ! you would not beat a Man so . I went up to her , and he and she were a little apart , and he was a Hoing . She said he had knock 'd her down with a Hoe and stamp 'd upon her Groin , and threatned to cut her Cloaths to pieces and stamp her Guts out at her Mouth for going upon his Crop . Ye Villain , says I , how can you serve a Woman so ? Hold your Tongue , says he , or I 'll give you as much more . I ca n't say the Prisoner is the Man . The Woman came every Day after , to my House , except the Day she dyed which was on the Sunday following .

Patrick Lambert , was indicted for that whereas at the Sessions held here in February last , Thomas Jenkins was convicted of stealing a Pestle and Mortar , the Goods of Michael Merchant , January 16 , and a fourteen Pound Weight , the Goods of Charles Anterack , January 18 . He the said Patrick Lambert did afterwards receive the same Goods knowing them to be stolen . The Record of the Conviction of Thomas Jenkins was read . Mr . Merchant . I lost a Pestle and Mortar , and it was brought home again , but I neither know who stole it , or who brought it back . Morgan Jenkins . I was at the Prisoner 's House in Compton Street , when his Kinswoman Mary brought down the Pestle and Mortar , and delivered them to a Man to carry to Mr . Merchant 's House , which was about two hundred Yards off ; and in about three Minutes I saw the same Pestle and Mortar at Mr . Merchant 's - And I saw a fourteen Pound Leaden Weight carried from the Prisoner 's Shop to Mr. Anterack 's - The Prisoner 's was not present when either of these Goods were delivered back ; for there being a Warrant against him he absconded . Mr. Anterack . I lost a fourteen Pound Leaden Weight ; and Edward Saxon who was an Evidence against Thomas Jenkins in February last , swore that they stole the Weight and sold it to the Prisoner . In two or three Days after this , a Leaden Weight was brought to my House , but it was not mine . Mr J. Deveil . Jenkins was convicted on Saxon 's Evidence . The Prisoner absconded , and was not to be found in four Months . Saxon being very sick in Prison , I discharged him . But he afterwards came voluntarily to me , and I bound a Person in forty Pounds for Saxon 's Appearance - There lies the Recognizance . William Barly , Constable . The Bail for Saxon told me yesterday , that the Prisoner had sent a Man from Newgate to bribe Saxon to keep out of the way - I took up the Prisoner with Justice Deveil 's Warrant , and carried him to the Justice 's House . The Justice not being at home , I went to fetch Saxon , and when I returned I found Major Barnwell there . He took me into the Justice 's Parlor , and putting his Hand into mine , he said , Be easy , be favourable , let the Man go , and I 'll give ye what ye will , and be a Friend to you as long as you live - I charg 'd him with this before Mr. Justice Deveil 's Face . Court to M. Barnwell . What do you say to this , Sir ? You ought to know 't is a great Offence to endeavour to screen any Person from Justice . Major Barnwell . I never intended it , but thought the Man was innocent . Court . Sir , You have been too busy-You ought to be indicted . William Barly . As I was carrying the Prisoner in a Coach to Newgate , he said to me , If I did receive a Pestle and Mortar knowing it to be stolen , it 's hard to be transported for one and twenty Pence . I went the same Day to the Prisoner 's House , and found a Thief selling Lead there - The Prisoner was convicted about five Years ago for receiving a Leaden Pump that was stolen , and was to have been transported . Dideric Hindson . A dud leef two , tree Year in his Neighbourhood , and I know no wrong of him .

But being charged with several other Robberies in Surry , & c. he was carried down to Kingston to be tryed at the Assizes held there in March last ; when no Bill being found against him , he was discharged . William Power . On Tuesday the thirteenth of this Month , between five and six in the Evening , as I was walking in the Fields not far from Lamb 's Conduit with a Neighbour 's Lad ( William Howson ) a little behind me I was met by the Prisoners and other Fellows . One of them ( in a Jockey 's Black Cap ) struck me on the Breast and collar 'd me ; and just as I was falling , the Prisoner Sutton came up and took out my Watch . I mist it immediately , and said , he has got my Watch . Thereupon Hoxson went to the end of Red-Lyon-Street and call 'd for help . When I was down , Sutton beat me violently , and the Prisoner Godson step 'd up , and said , Sir , you have dropt your Watch in the Scuffle , and so he gave it me again . Company coming up , a Brick-layer said , Ye Dogs , do you rob at this time o ' Day ? I 'll run my Trowel in your Guts . One Man collar 'd Sutton , and then I ran to call a Constable . William Howson . My Master , ( James Brook , a Poulterer in Holborn ) sent into Red Lyon Street to see for this Gentleman ( the Prosecutor . ) I found him there , and he said , if I 'd go to the Three Tuns , he 'd make me drink : I went with him , and coming to a Pond , we met four Fellows , who said to one another , He 's drunk . Damn 'em , says the Prosecutor , What would they be at ? Damn ye , says he in the Black Cap , Will ye fight ? and so stripping back his Coat , he struck the Prosecutor on the Breast . Then Sutton took the Prosecutor 's Watch , and put it into his own Pocket . I desired them not to hurt the Gentleman , because he was in drink , though he was not quite drunk , for he could walk very well . Thomas Plunket . Going with Mr. Elkins towards Pancras , we heard a Gentleman had lost his Watch . We ran up to the place . The Prosecutor , said , Sutton had robbed him . Sutton damn 'd the Prosecutor , and struck him for saying so . Godson stood by , and endeavoured to part them . I asked Sutton what he meant by abusing the Man ? He answered he would serve me the same , and so he and I had two or three Struggles . I was sorry Sutton fell in my way , because I had some knowledge of his Family . Sutton . The Prosecutor had insulted me , and I pulled off my Coat to fight him . Plunket . I did not see that the Prosecutor made any resistance . Mr. Elkins . Going into Lamb 's Conduit-Fields , I stood up a little for a Shower of Rains when the Prosecutor went by me . I followed and saw four Men about him ; a Man and a Woman came by and said , There 's a Man has been robb 'd , and will be murdered . I ran towards them with my Trowel in my Hand , and called to Plunket to come along with the Pistols . When we came up , two of them got away , but the two Prisoners staid , and Sutton collar 'd the Prosecutor , and threw him on the Grass . Thomas Holloway . Coming by the New Burying Ground , a little on this side the Bowling Green , I saw five People in contest . Two had hold of each others Collar . The Prosecutor said , For God 's sake help me , for I am barbarously used , and robb 'd - The Prosecutor went for a Constable - A Man came up with a Trowel - Sutton ran away , but fell into a Ditch , where he was taken . Alexander Christopher . I was at my Master 's Stables next the Fields , and hearing a Noise of a Robbery , I ran out with other Servants , and saw five or six Men together , and one sneaking along by a Hedge , and when he came over the Ditch he looked pale and frighted , and we stopt him . Another Witness deposed to the same purpose . Then Sutton 's Confession taken May 14. before John Poulson , Esq ; was proved and read in Court to the following effect . I and Godson , Stockton and Benyan , met about two in the Afternoon at Lloyd 's , the Sun and Horshoe in Dyer 's Street , and there agreed to go into the Fie'ds and rob . From Lloyd 's we went to an opposite Brandy Shop , and thence to an infamous House the Two Fighting Cocks at the Brill , kept by Taylor alias Pritchard . Going thence we met with the Prosecutor : One of us ( who was in a Black Cap ) fell upon him : I took his Watch and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket ; but People coming up , and the Watch String hanging out , I threw the Watch on the Ground . Godson took it up , and gave it to the Prosecutor , that the Prosecutor might not think he belonged to our Company . Sutton . I was drunk when I made that Confession , and the Thief Takers persuaded me to say any thing . Mr.Justice Polson . He was sober - I bid him not be deceived , for it was an Examination , and not an Information - He read it over himself before he sign 'd it . Godson . I am a Shoemaker and lived at Rochester , I came to London on the Sunday Night , and on the Tuesday following I went to see a Brother-Craft in Phoenix Street , but did not meet with him . As I was coming back I met Sutton , and he asked me to drink , for I had some knowledge of him , having formerly done Work for some of his Family . We went to the Sun and Horshoe , where I found two more of his Acquaintance : We drank together there , and when we came out I was going towards Hound 's Ditch , but by their persuasions I went with them to a House a-cross the Fields , I do n't know the House for I was never there before . But I was in haste to go home , and so we came away , and had not gone far before we met the Prosecutor , with whom one of Sutton 's Acquaintance ( in a Black Cap ; had some Words , upon which , Sutton stept up and said , Damn ye , will you fight . Presently the Prosecutor said he had lost his Watch , at hearing which , I was frighted and trembled ; but seeing a Watch upon the Ground , I took it up and give it to the Prosecutor . Henry Beck . Godson work 'd for me as a Journey-man at Rochester , he went from my House on Sunday , and was to be back again on Tuesday ; I entrusted him to cut out Work , and take care of my Business , and always found him very honest and just . The Jury acquitted Godson , and found Sutton , Guilty . Death . 24.

On the fourth of February last , about nine at Night , my House at Edgware was broke open . Somebody came to the Door and call 'd me by my Name . My Servant , John Peats , unbolted the Door , and presently five Men rush 'd in with ten Pistols , each of the Men having one in each Hand , I can not say positively that the Prisoner was one of them , but there was a Man among them pretty much like him . They swore they 'd kill me , if I did not give 'em my Money . They took out of my Pocket a Guinea , a six-and-thirty . Shilling Piece , and between ten and twenty Shillings in Silver . They broke the two Buttons off my Breeches and let them down . They took me up Stairs , and said they wanted more Money . They broke open a Door there , and took out two Guineas , ten Shillings , a Silver Cup with two Handles , four Gold Rings , and three Silver Spoons - they had taken another Silver Spoon below Stairs - still they wanted more , and swore they would kill me if I did not tell them where the rest of my Money was . My Breeches being down , they set my bare backside on the Fire . I was not burnt indeed , but sorely scalded . They took a Case Knife , and threatned to rip me up , and brought a Bill to chop my Legs off to make me confess . They carried me into a Back Room where the Maid was beating up Butter , they took the Kettle off the Fire with two Pails of Water in it , and throwing me down , they threw the Water all over me , but it happened not to be quite scalding hot . My Son had in the House between twenty and thirty Pounds which was all lost - They took my Sheets , Table Cloths , Napkins , and all the best Linnen I had - They broke my Head with their Pistols , so that the blood run down and matted my Hair , and swore that I should not live till Morning if I did not discover where my Money was - One of them had a Linnen Cloth over his Face , and they had pull 'd up the Capes of their Coats - At their first coming in , they broke a Fowling Piece which they found in my Room , and before they went , they said they 'd go and serve my son Joseph just as they had served me , and bid my Boy shew them the way to his House ; but I having another Son who was not come home , they were afraid to venture after they had staid three Quarters of an Hour for his coming . They then tyed my Hands and Legs , and the Hands and Legs of my Man and Maid and Boy , and so leaving us lying upon our Backs , they lock 'd the Door and went away - They took from my House in Money and Goods to the value of about sixty Pounds . John Wheeler . The Prisoner and I , and Joseph Rose and John Fielder , and Richard Turpin went on the fourth of February to John Rowlets at the Black Horse Inn in the Broad Way , Westminster , where my Horse and Gregory 's stood . The Prisoner told us he had worked at Edgware , and had shod this Farmer ( the Prosecutor 's ) Horses , and that he was worth a good deal of Money , and it was by his Advice that we went thither . The Prisoner and I , and Rose went out first ; Turpin and Fielder follow 'd , and overtook us on the Road ; we drank two or three Pots at the Bowl and Skettle on the Hill on this side Edgware . Thence we went to the Queen 's Head at Stanmore , where we drank Beer , and eat Bacon and Eggs for Supper . We set out again between six and seven . I believe it wanted but a small matter of seven , and so rode into the Farmer ( Lawrence 's ) Grounds , as I suppose they were , and tyed up our Horses within a Quarter of a Mile of his House . Hearing the Boy calling up the Sheep , we staid a little and then went forward , and Fielder jumpt over a sort of a half Door and seiz 'd the Sheep-boy , and tyed his Hands , and bid him go to his Master 's Door and knock , and answer to any Body that asked who was there . He knock 'd , a servant Man open 'd the Door ; I and Rose and the Prisoner had two Pistols each , but I think that Turpin and Fielder had but one a-piece . We all rush 'd in ; we bound the Boy again ( for we had unbound him ) and then we bonnd the Man and the Maid . I stood over them , while the others carried up the Old Man to make him shew them the House . All the Money that I saw was three Guineas , two Half Crowns and eighteen Pence . The Prisoner came down to the Maid , and said , Damn Ye , shew me where your Master 's Money is . She made him a Curtesy , and said , she did not know . But he made her go up Stairs with him : And when she came down , she cryed ; I asked her if any body had beat her ; she answered , No , But one of your Men has lain with me . Court . Did she say by force ? Wheeler . I did not hear her say so . We put the Linnen in Sacks - the Plate I believe they put in their Pockets - and carried all to our Horses . We came home about eleven , and next Day we divided our Booty . Rose gave us fifteen Shillings for all the Linnen , and he likewise bought of us the two handled Silver Cup , three Gold Rings , three Silver Spoons . but I ca n't say now for how much ; and Mrs. Rose made them off for him . The Prisoner , as we were going home , told us , I believe twenty times , that he had lain with the Maid in the Garret . Court . Did he say by force ? Wheeler . He said , he bolted the Garret Door , and laid a Pistol on the Bed while he lay with her . Prisoner . I do n't deny that I was with them at the Prosecutor 's House , but I had nothing that came from thence , for they were taken that Day sennight . Wheeler . He was with us when we divided the Money , and had his part , and perhaps more than I , for they cheated me in every respect ; so that out of sixty Pounds , I had but four . Prisoner . I ought to have had my share of whatever was taken - though I can not say that any thing was taken , for I went no farther than just within the Door where I stood to watch . Court . But when they went away , Did you see no Sacks carried out ? Prisoner . Not to my knowledge . Dorothy Street . I was in the Back House . when the Rogues came in ; there was five in all , and I am sure the Prisoner was one of them . They Rankshatteld ( Ransacked ) the House . I did not see them take the Goods , for I and the Man and the Boy were tyed in the Parlor . But then the Prisoner came and said , I should go up Stairs with them . Wheeler went formost , and the Prisoner took me up after him into my Master 's Room , and they said , they 'd Rankshattle in that Room . Wheeler went to the Foot of the Garret Stairs and would go no farther ; but the Prisoner swore that he would go up , and he forced me up with him into the Garret , and there he swore he would lie with me . I told him I was a young Girl , and knew nothing of the matter ; but he bolted the Garret Door , and swore if I would not yield , he would kill me ; and so he threw me on the Bed , and laid one Pistol upon the Bed , and another on a Chest just by , and forced me . Court . How did he force you ? Were you drest or undrest ? D. Street . I was drest . He pull 'd up my Coats and took out what he - and - into me . And he push 'd as hard as ever he could for the Life and Soul of him . Court . Did you perceive - ? D. Street . Yes ; And then he asked me if ever I was lain with before ? and I said , No . And then he let me go down ; and I cry 'd , and one of them said , What 's the Matter ? and I said , one of your Men has lain with me . Richard Wood . I keep the Nine Pin and Bowl on this side Edgware . On the fourth of February last , the Prisoner and Wheeler and three more came to my House and drank together . They staid about three Quarters of an Hour , and went away a Quarter before five ; but did not say whither they were going . Joseph Ironmonger . I keep the Queen 's Head at Stanmore . On the fourth of February five Men came to my House ; Wheeler was one of them , and I believe the Prisoner was another . They staid a little above an Hour , and went away at four or five Minutes past seven . They turned towards London , which is the way to Farmer Lawrence 's House . Thomas Lawrence . I was not at home when my Father 's House was robbed . But about three or four Years ago , the Prisoner work 'd for Richard Taylor , a Smith at Edgware and shod my Father 's Horses - I went to see him in Newgate on the fourteenth of this Month , and he own 'd to me , That he shew 'd the others the way to our House , for he thought we had got a great deal of Money . Why did you think so , says I . Because you paid every body very well , says he , and therefore I thought you must be very rich . He told me too that he lay with the Maid , and that he had twenty five Shillings of the Money that was taken . Richard Taylor . He lived with me six Months at Edgware , and he shod Farmer Lawrence 's Horses at both Houses . Archelaus Pullen . The Day after the Prisoner came to Town , I went to see him in Newgate . He told me he lay with the Girl ; but that she was either as willing as he , or else she was afraid ; for he said he had two Pistols and laid them down by her . He confest likewise that he was concern 'd in the Robbery . Prisoner . I have no Witnesses , nor one Friend in the World , and so I must leave it to the Court . Then the Witnesses against the Prisoner for breaking and entring the House of William Francis , and stealing the Goods and Money , and for assaulting and robbing the said William Francis , were called and appeared . + + See the Trial of Fielder , Rose , Walker , and Bush , for the same Burglary and Robbery , in March last . Sessions Paper Number 3 . Page 56 . Prisoner . I ' l give the Court and the Jury no farther trouble . I own I was at that House , and took the Money and Goods , and had two Guineas for my Share . Court . What do you say as to stealing the Horse ? Prisoner . I am guilty of that too - My Lord , there are two Gold Watches in the Custody of Sir Simeon Stewart , a Justice of the Peace in Ham Shire , ought they not to be brought into Court ? Court . Are they part of the Goods for which you are indicted ? Prisoner . No ; One was Sir John Osbaston 's Watch ; it had a Gold Case . The other was a little Watch with a Shagreen Case . Court . Then they are not before this Court , and we can make no Order about them . Prisoner . Besides , they took my Silver Buckles ( which cost me 18 s. ) out of my Shoes , and took away all my Linnen , in Winchester Goal . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of all the six Indictments . Death . 25. Thomas Lattimore , of Enfield , was indicted for stealing a White Gelding , value 25 s. the Property of William Beckley . He was a second time indicted for stealing a Black Gelding , value 30 s. the Property of William Beckley , March 5 . William Beckley . I lost my Horses , and heard from a Relation at Cheshunt , that they were sold . I went and found that Abraham Wells had bought the White Horse , and Edward Stanley the Black Horse . Prisoner . Did not you deliver the Horses to me to carry them to Cheshunt Marsh ? Beckley . Yes ; The Prisoner was my next Door Neighbour in Carbuncle Street in Chesunt . Edward Stanley . I bought the Black Horse of the Prisoner . I had often seen him before , but never had heard any ill of him . I gave a Guinea for him . About a Fortnight afterwards , Beckley claimed the Horse , and I told him if it was his he should have it . Abraham Wells . I took the Prisoner for a very honest Man , he offered to sell me a little Gray Horse twelve Hands high for 10 s. He said he bought it at Enfield for 15 s. before Christmas . I bid him 7 s. and he took the Money . Prisoner . The Prosecutor gave me leave to put the Horses in the Marsh . Court . But who gave you leave to take them out ? Prisoner . Really I ca n't tell that . Mr. Taverner . The Prisoner was my Tenant at forty five Shillings a Year , I thought him a very honest Man . John Howard / . I saw him make his Confession of Justice Brown Enfield , on the twenty sixth April . The Confession was read to this Effect : ' That about two Months ago he stole a Grey Horse , and sold him the same Day to Abraham Wells for six Shillings and six Pence , and spent it all , except one Shilling which he gave to Elizabeth Smith to lie with her ; and ten Days afterwards stole a Black Horse from the same place , and sold him for twenty one Shillings to Mr. Stanly at Newington Butts .

On May Day , at a Quarter past five in the Evening , as I was going from London to Chelsea , in the third of the five Fields , the Prisoner came over a Hedge , with a Knife and a great stick in his Hand , and said , You , Mr. Mackenzy , You have got some Money , and I want to borrow it of ye . No , Robert , says I , but I have none . I know you have Money , says he , and I ll have it before I go . There were three People with him in Women 's Clothes , but one was a Man as I knew by his Beard , and a Mole that he had . The Women held me while the Prisoner took my Money and beat me - When I took the Prisoner , I likewise took Macdonal , his pretended Wife , but she raised a hundred Mob and got away . Prisoner .

The Prisoner makes Cabbage Nets , and is a very honest harmless old Man . Thomas Bensy .

Matth.ew Bedford , of White Chapple , for receiving fifty Hundred Weight of the same knowing it to be stol'n , March 17 . It appear 'd that a large Quantity of Logwood belonging to Mess . Sidebotham and Wright , was lost out of the Ware House of Mr. Farmer . That the Prisoner Joyner , who was a Ballast-man , lodged at the Prisoner Stedman 's House , the Hand in Hand at Bow Creek . That a remarkable Boat ( both ends being alike ) loaded with Logwood was seen at Stedman 's Back Door on the sixteenth of March . That Joyner own 'd he put the Logwood into the Boat : And that Joyner 's Mate ( Richard Bogue ) had carried the Boat into Bow Creek . That three Cart Loads of Logwood were carried from Stedman 's ( by order of Joyner and Bogue ) to the Prisoner Bedford 's House , at the Grey-hound against White Chappel Church on the seventeenth of March , besides one Load from the bottom of Old Gravel Lane , and one Load from the Hermitage . And that two Hundred Weight of Logwood was afterwards found , part in Stedman 's Brew-house , and Part in his Stable . But there not being sufficient Proof that this Logwood was the same that was lost , or that Joyner stole it , the Jury acquitted the Prisoners . John Joyner , was a second time indicted . And . 35. Thomas Easton , for breaking and entring the House of John Farmer , and stealing fifteen Hundred and twenty five Pound of Logwood , the Property of Samuel Sidebotham , and Thomas Wright , April 27 . about the Hour of one in the Night . John Farmer I live at Lime Kiln Dock . My Warehouse and Dwelling House are Contigous ; they are not both under one Roof , but the Roofs join , and there is a Door goes out of my Dwelling House into the Warehouse , in which I had a considerable Parcel of Logwood belonging to Samuel Sidebotham , and Thomas Wright . Between one and two on Sunday Morning , the twenty seventh of April , the Watch called me up , and said , my House was broke open . I went into my Yard , and saw a Man standing there , but as soon as he perceiv 'd the Light of the Lanthorn , he stept into a Ballast Lighter that was moor 'd under the Crane . I found fifty two Sticks of Logwood lying in the Yard close to the Water Side . The two Prisoners were both found in the Lighter , and pretended they were driven thither by Stress of Weather , tho ' there was no Wind stiring . They had left their Key in the Warehouse Door . Before the Justice they denied that they were in the Yard ; yet Joyner own 'd that Key , and they both confest that they moor 'd the Lighter there . Daniel Lewis . About one in the Morning , it being just High Water , my Boat got a Shore by this Gentleman 's Yard , and had like to have been over set . I saw this Ballast Lighter coming up with two Men in her , and suspected they had no good Design , and so I lay down in my Boat to watch them . Presently they moor 'd the Lighter under the Crane and both came ashore , and whispered . Then they went towards the Warehouse , and I heard the Door open . I saw them bring out Logwood , and lay it by the Water Side . I believe they went seven or eight times in the same manner . It was a Moon-light Night , and tho ' I could not then distinguish their Faces because I was on the other Side of the Dock , yet I can swear that the Men that came out of the Lighter , were the same Men that opened the Warehouse Door , and brought out the Woods , for I could see very plainly that there was no other Person in the Yard ; and they and no others were taken in the Lighter . I went and call 'd the Watch , and then the Prisoners jump 'd off the Wharf into the Lighter , where they were both taken . Easton . Was there no other Lighter ? Lewis . Yes ; there was a Chalk Lighter . John Jones . I was just come from Eriff , and went to the Watch House , when Lewis came and told us the Ware House was broke open . We went in my Boat , and I heard the Logwood rattle ; but as soon as the Light came , I saw the Prisoners jump off the Wharf into the Lighter . Joyner crept under the Foresail , and Easton laid down on the Windless , both pretending to be asleep . I pulled the Foresail off Joyner , and he asked hastily what 's the matter ? what 's the matter ? - When they were before the Justice , Joyner own 'd that the Key which was found in the Ware House Door , was the Key as locked his Oars . Joyner . We had no Oars at that time . Jones . May be so - But you said so for all that . J. Swainson . There were fifty two Pieces of Logwood , and one piece of Redwood , taken out of the Ware House , and left at the Edge of the Wharf . The Logwood weigh 'd fifteen Hundred , one Quarter , and twenty one Pound , and was worth ten Shillings a Hundred . Thomas Williams , a Lighter Man ( Easton 's Godfather , ) John Mires of Lime House ( with whom Easton lodged , ) William Martin , Thomas Pardo , William Atkinson , Richard Caves and Thomas Young , deposed , that Easton was a hard working Man , and they knew no ill of him : But they added , they could say nothing in favour of Joyner . The Jury found them both Guilty of Felony only . John Joyner , was a third time indicted for stealing thirty Barrels of Tar , the Goods of Josiah Jetsom , April 17 . But he being convicted on the former Indictments , the Court thought it unnecessary to try him on this . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 36 , 37. Mary Pinchbeck , the Wife of John Pinchbeck , and Joice Hunt , was indicted for assaulting Susan Wright , in the House of the said John Pinchbeck , putting her in fear , and taking from her thirteen Shillings , March 8 . Susan Wright . I ow 'd the Prisoner Mrs. Pinchbeck some Money , and went to her House in Field Lane to pay her eight Shillings in Part . But she did not approve it , and threw the Money about the Floor . Her Maid Joice Hunt , ( the other Prisoner ) pick 'd it up and gave it me again , and I put it to five Shillings more which I had in my Pocket . Then Pinchbeck bid her Maid shut the Door , and said , she 'd see what the Old Bitch had got in her Pocket . With that she took me by the Throat , put her Hand in my Pocket , and took out thirteen Shillings and two Thimbles . Then she said , I 'll see what the Old bitch has got in her Bosom . And not content with hunting in my Bosom as low as my Wake , she punch 'd me , and Bruised me , and beat with in an Inch of my Life - I was shut up in the Parlor above an Hour . Rebecca Bristol . My Mother was missing above an Hour . When she came home , I said , Mother , where have you been ? She burst out a crying , and said , she had been at Mrs. Pinchbecks , who had picked her Pocket of all her Money - I thought she would have died that Night ; and for my part , I was six Months gone , and miscarried upon it . Pinchbeck . I have subsisted this Woman these fourteen Years , because she was a poor Widow , and I was willing to relieve the Widow and the Fatherless ; I have lent at times twenty or thirty Pounds and never took a Farthing Interest . S. Wright . But you sold Wine and - Pinchbeck . I lent her thirty Shillings when she put her Boy 'Prentice to a Weaver in Bridewell , and when he came out of his Time , I lent her seven Pound to buy him a Loom . She was seven Years in paying me four Pound nine Shillings - I lent her thirty Shillings but last Christmas , and she beg 'd me to make it up four Pound . And when she should have paid me , she was arrested by a Tally Man : Upon which her Son came and intruded on my Goodness for twenty Shillings more to help her out . After this , she offer 'd me twenty seven Shillings towards the five Pound , and promis 'd to pay me the rest Weekly , and accordingly , she was to have brought me nineteen Shillings on the Day she says I robb 'd her . But she brought no more than thirteen Shillings which she put into my Hand ; and as I was telling it , she said , Hold ! I have given you too much , and so she catch 'd it all out of my Hand again , and desired me to let her have a Crown of it . How can you say there 's too much ? Says I , when I ought to have eighteen Shillings . God D - ye , for a Bitch , says she , and catches up a Quart Pot , I 'll split your Scull . But my Maid stepping between . I got no Mischief . This was on the eighth of March , and on the sixteenth , I arrested her , upon which , Lawyer Theobald put it into her Head to prosecute me , and so on the nineteenth she got a Warrant against me . S. Wright . When she lent me Money , she made me spend good part of it at her House in Brandy and Wine . Daniel Smith . She keeps a Linnen Draper 's Shop . S. Wright . She 's a Tally Woman . Mr. Just . Robe . On the twenty first of March , she was brought before me , by vertue of a Warrant from Ald . Brocas for violently assaulting and beating Susan Wright and taking thirteen Shillings out of her Pocket ; I kept her above an Hour , but neither Wright nor any body else appearing against her , I took good Bail , and returned the Recognizance to Hick 's Hall - Theobald afterwards came to me and threatned me for taking Bail in such a Case William Dakin . I have known her thirteen Years , her Circumstances are such , that she has no occasion to act in such a manner ; and her Principles are such , that , I believe she would not . Dr. - She lives just by me in Field Lane , and has as honest a Character as any Woman in England - She has been my Patient these twenty Years . Mr. Roundtree .

I am Servant to Mr. Shovel in New Broad Street . About ten at Night , as I went into the Parlor to fetch a Candlestick , I heard a little Noise , and looking , I saw the Prisoner lying on his Face on the Parlor Stairs , his Feet were four Steps from the bottom . He turned his face towards me , but as I had only a Candle and Candlestick in my Hand , and knowing the Street Door was fast , I seemed to take no notice of him , but went down into the Kitchen to fetch a Poker , and to call my Fellow Servants ; but when we came up , the Man was gone . The Door being still locked and chain 'd , we went into the Dining Room up one pair of Stairs fronting the Street : The Sashes of this Room were then all three drawn up . But there was but one up , and the other two were shut down two or three Hours before I saw the Prisoner . We concluded he was got out that way , and so we called Thieves ! and some body said , Here 's a Man at the Door , come and see if this is he . I went down , and found it was the same Person . Elizabeth Cresswell . I was standing at my Master 's Door ( next to the Prosecutors ) and saw the Prisoner jump from the Lamp to the Ground - The Lamp was half a Yard or three Quarters from the Dining Room Window .

I assured him I should take the liberty of striking again , for all his Authority , and so I did . But what harm did I do him ? Let him shew his Marks , if he has any .

I live at Barkham Wood beyond Stanmore . I had been to Hampstead , where I sold my Eggs : and riding homewards , about four in the Afternoon , I met three Men a Horse-back upon Golder 's Green . One rid by me , and when the others came up , they parted , one on each file of me . The Prisoner said Dame , what do you sell ? Butter , Sir , says I , and I have but two Pound left , and you shall have it for sixteen Pence - I 'll have it says he , and carry it to my Sister ; but can you change half a Guinea . I said , Yes . I took out 9 s. 6 d. Then he said to his Friend , Do you pay for it , and then I need not change ; the other Man came and took five Shillings and six Pence out of my Lap - Then the Prisoner gave me this Shilling for the Butter . I had received just such a Shilling at Hampstead for Eggs , and had taken particular notice of it . for I doubted the Goodness of it , and I thought this Shilling to be the same ; and I was confirmed in it by missing the five and six Pence . Thomas Quinny . The Prisoner owned that , he gave the Woman the Shilling for the Butter and that Yorkshire Tom was with him . William Booker . I heard the Prisoner say that Thomas Hargrove , alias Yorkshire Tom , took four Shillings six Pence out of the Woman 's Lap , and that he was in company with him . James Lawrence . The Prisoner and his two Comrades , about half an Hour before they bought the Butter , came to my House for half a Quartern of Brandy . They gave my Wife a Guinea to change . She went up for Change . They desired me to give their Horses a Mouthful of Hay , which I did . The Prisoner said to Yorkshire Tom , You have no need to change . I 'll pay for the Brandy , give him his Gold again . Aye , says my Wife , When he gives me the Silver . So he put down the Silver , but my Wife telling it , she said there wanted five Shillings , and upon examining , there was five Shillings , found in his Hand . Three or four Witnesses deposed that they knew no ill of the Prisoner , that he was a Butcher by Trade , and behaved well in his 'Prenticeship , which expired between three and four Years ago .

I live at Mr. John Skipworth , a Brandy Merchant in Goswell Street , near Old Street . On Easter Thursday my Master sent me on an Errand into Bishop's-Gate Street . I met the Prisoner there and asked him for the Sign of the Helmet . He took me round the Wastes , and tickled me , and said , he was going that way , and would shew me . But he asked me if I would not drink first . I was very dry , and went with him to an Ale House , the backside of Bishops Gate Street . We sat in a Publick Room , he on one side of a Narrow Drinking Table , and I on the other . He put his Hand under the Table into my Breeches - The Maid happen 'd to see what he was doing , and so he threw down his three Half Pence for a Pint of Beer , and bid me come along Then he said , he 'd go into a Bye Alley : so I went with him thro ' the Jew 's Synagogue , into a Bye Alley , where he did as before , but a Man coming by discovered us , and then we run away again , and he wanted me to go to another place , but I told him I could not stay . As we were going along in my way home , he offer 'd to give me a Pint of Wine , if I would not tell what he had done . I said I should have Anger for staying . In Bishop 's Gate Church Yard , he bought me a Nosegay , and a Penny Custard . Coming to Bedlam he perfectly pull 'd and haul 'd me into see the Mad-folks . There he took me into the House of Office , and pull 'd down his own Breeches and mine , and - in his Mouth : Then he carried me into the Booth , to see the Wild Beasts . When we came out , he said , he hop 'd he should see me often . I told him I lived at the end of Old Street . He came by my Master 's Door several times afterwards and spoke to me . The last time was last Sunday , when he asked me where we should meet . I said at the New Church in Old Street . So he went , and I took three Lads with me , and went after him I soon found him , and he asked me to go into the Fields . We left the three Boys just by Sam Allen 's , the Shepherd and Shepherdess , by the Pest-house Fields and went two or three Stones throw higher to some Hay Cocks by a Cow House ; where he let down his own Breeches and mine , and put his Breech in my Lap ; but a Boy came up and disturbed us , and then these three Lads came up . The Prisoner asked them if they had been catching Birds : They answered , No He bid me come along ; they follow 'd us into the Ivy House ( an Ale House grown over with lvy ) there we sat in an Arbour , and he call 'd for a Pint of Ale and a Bun , and the three Lads call 'd for a Pint . They went into the Yard to see the Birds , and he I suppose had some mistrust of 'em , for he paid and went out directly , and then run as hard as he could . I ran after him , and the three Lads after me . Coming to Hoxton a young Man asked what was the matter , we said there was a Sodomite . So the young Man catch 'd him , and I went for a Constable , who carried him before Justice Chandler . Court . Did you inform these three Boys of what the Prisoner had done to ? Holloway . Yes ; and I carried them with me on purpose to take him . Court . Are any of them here ? Holloway . No . Court . Is the Maid at the Ale House here ? or the Man at the lvy House ? Holloway No . Prisoner . He told the Justice that he acquainted those Boys , with it , but when the Justice asked the Boys , they said they knew nothing of it . Holloway . I told the Boys that I took out with me ; but not the Boys that run with me . Prisoner . You spoke of none but the three Boys that came out with you , for you said , they follow 'd us to the Ivy House . Charles Williams . I was one that took the Prisoner at the White Hart at Hoxton . Court . Did he run ? Williams . No ; he walk 'd pretty fast , but Holloway . himself , could not say before the Justice that he run . Holloway was not always in the same Story about the three Boys , and they contradicted one another . Several Witnesses deposed they had known the Prisoner twenty or thirty Years that he bore the Character of a very honest sober Man , and they never heard that he was guilty of any such Indecencies . The Jury acquitted him . 51. George Wood , was indicted for wilful and corrupt Perjury , in an Affidavit made before the Hon . Mr. Justice Probyn .
