Elizabeth Owen was Tryed upon two several Indictments , the first of which was , for setting fire to the House of James Cooper , in the Parish of St. Dunstans in the West , on the 8th day of November last , she being then a Servant in the said House . The circumstances of the Fact were these , That in the evening of the day before-mentioned , between eleven and twelve of the clock , she came to the Tapster , and informed him that she smelt a grievous smoak , and thereupon demanded of him what he was burning ? who answered , nothing but Coals ; with this , she not being satisfied , went to her Master , and informed him how that she believed the House was on fire , for there was a smoak that made her coff extreamly , yet at that time there could be no smoak perceived , but the Tapster going into the yard , soon discovered that the upper part of the House was on a light fire , at which , in a great consternation , he and the rest , ran up stairs ; and with the assistance of several Neighbours , had the good luck to extinguish the flame , which had consumed several Trunks , and burnt quite through the floor : during which space the now Prisoner went directly to another Garret , and opening a box , found that on fire likewise , upon these , and her denying to carry water , she was suspected , and upon farther search , they found that she had broken open the Trunk , and tying up the wearing Apparel of Erasmus Armstrong in one of her Aprons , had thrown them into a Neighbours yard . As likewise she had taken away three Rings , and a Jacobus . These circumstances being proved against her , she was found guilty of both the Indictments , that is , for seting fire to the House , and stealing the Tapsters Cloaths , Rings , and Gold , & c. [ Death . See summary . ] Margaret Adams , of the Parish of St . Brides , took her Tryal for Murthering her Male Bastard Child ; the Evidence against her was , that she being lately come to London , had got her a Service , her Mistress not perceiving that she was with Child , but lodged a little Girl with her , when she on the 28th of November last , was delivered without the knowledge of any , and rising early next morning went about her occasions , leaving the Child dead in the bed with her Mistresses Daughter , it being conjectured that she had smothered it with the Bed-cloaths , the which the Girl waking found , and called out , saying , there was a Child in the bed , whereuponseveral Neighbours coming in , found it to be so . Upon her Tryal she pleaded that the Child was still born , and that one John Ashmore , upon promise of Marriage so far prevailed as to deflour her , but upon the reading of the Statute in that case made and provided , she was found guilty of the Murther . [ Death . See summary . ] Charles Sancey a Frenchman , was Tryed for feloniously entring the house of a French Marquess , in the Parish of St. Martins in the fields . The Evidence against him , and his own Confession before Justice Floyd , was this , first the Evidence swore , that about one or two of the clock in the morning , he heard Murther and Thieves , cryed out in the Marquesses Lodging , whereupon rising and running thither , he found the lower doors open , and going up stairs , found the Marquesses Steward weltring in his Blood , and a great Knife lying by him , so that finding no man there beside , he searched about , ( there being then several come to his assistance ) and to the Celler found the Prisoner , all besmeared with the Stewards Blood , who being carried before the Justice , did confess , that he and four more had a design to rob the Marquess , they having not long since robbed him of 400 Guini 's . Upon his Tryal he pleaded that he was drunk , and that he got into the House by chance , not knowing any thing of the business , yet that served not his turn , for although he carried away nothing , as being timely prevented , he was found guilty of breaking the house in the night time with an intent to steal . [ Death . See summary . ] Thomas Stone was Tryed for Robbing of , and barbarously wounding Henry Atley of the Parish of Latham in the County of Middlesex , the substance of the Tryal thus ; the Prisoner setting upon the aforesaid Alley , bid him deliver his Money , which he refusing , he drew out Pistol and shot him through the wrift , of which wound he languished that time , it being the 27th of February , to the second of March , and then dyed . There was very strong presumption against the prisoner , but there being no positive proof that he was the Man , he was acquitted . Susanna Haselwood received her Tryal for entring the House of Jeremiah Lupton , on the 26th of October , in the day and taking thence out Holland-sheet , a Table Cloath , a pinner , and several other things , being by some of the Neighbours taken as soon as ever she came out of the house , she pretended she lodged there , and going in again , she threw down the things , and dropped several Picklock keys in the Chimney corner . Upon her Tryal she denyed that she ever was in the House ; but the proof being plain , she was found guilty to the value of four shillings and six pence . Benjamine Wilcason was indicted for stealing a Shift , several Napkins , Table-cloaths , and other Linnen , out of a house neer Paul 's Wharf , and pleaded guilty to all Felonies within the benefit of his Clergy ; and thereupon was burnt in the hand . Samuel Doughty and John Cows , were tryed for stealing a silver Tankard from Walter Briscoe in the Parish of St. Andrew Holborn , valued at five pounds . The Prisoners pleaded that the said Briscow 's Wife had given the Tankard to one of them , viz . Doughty , who ; as he said , had been a Servant to the Marquiss of Winchester , for some Kindnesses that he had obliged her in ; and that she had often opportun 'd Cows , who was a Hat-maker by Trade , to deliver the same to Doughty , telling him , He should come to no damage by the same , saying , That it was in part to makehim amends for the service he had lost by keeping of her company ; and that she would farther gratifie him , or words to that effect . Upon which he delivered it , and it was sold to a Goldsmith , in whose hands Briscowe found it ; but there being no Proof to contradict the womans delivering of it , they were both acquitted . Jane Lant was tryed for stealing of Silks to the value of twelve pounds , from a Mercer . Her Plea was , That another had stollen the same and delivered it to her ; but she being present at the same time when it was stole , and part of the Goods afterwards found in her custody , she having been a notorious Shoplift , and several times pardoned , was found guilty of the Felony . [ Death . See summary . ] Edward Townsend was indicted for the murdering of Isaac Smith a Watchman , in Ivy-lane in the Parish of Saint Faiths , London . The Evidence against him was this , That he , in the company of Whitticar and Watson , condemned for the same the last Sessions , was coming down Pater Noster Row in May last about three of the clock in the morning , and in their way made such a noise as made the deceased , who was then upon his Stand , question them , and endeavour to stop them ; whereupon they resisted , and endeavoured to make their Escapes , Whitticar striking up Smith 's heels , and Watson beating down the Lanthorn of another Watchman there assisting ; which made Smith the deceased coller one of them , after which Watson snatching away his Staff , with the same knocked him down , and thereupon they all made their Escape . The blow was so violent , that it broke Smith 's Scull , and of the said Wound , according to the Oath of the Chirurgeon , he died within the space of four months after : When as they having notice that the Parties that had done the Fact lived in the Parish of St. James Clerkenwel ; they were apprehended , Watson and Whitticar , as aforesaid , being condemned for the same the last Sessions : But against the now Prisoner there being no positive Proof that he was of their company , or that he meddled in the Affair , he was acquitted . Anne Maurlin and Jane Fowler were severally Tryed , for Stealing the Goods of Richard Huetson , of the Parish of St. Botolfs without Algate ; the former for stealing of a Quart-pot , valued at 1 shil . 6 d. the which , as they swore , she conveyed away in a bundle of Linnen , which she had to wash : Her Plea was , that the Maid of the House delivered it to her ; and that she had since told her , that it was a Lodger that put it in for the Jeasts sake . The Evidence being heard on both hands , it proved , that the people that prosecuted kept an ill house ; So that the Jury brought the Prisoner in , Not Guilty . The latter was Indicted for stealing of Sheets , Tablecloaths , Napkins , and other Goods , to the value of 20 s. and several pieces of Plate and Moneys , she being a Nurse in the house . The most remarkable passage sn this Trial was , that a Fellow coming to testifie in the behalf of the Prisoner , that the Prosecutor had no such Goods as were pretended to be lost , himself knowing what was in her possession , having taken an Inventory of all during the time of her Husbands absence , and that he was fain to lend the woman of the House his Shirts to wear . But in his earnest discourse Swearing an Oath , the Court obliged him to pay 12 d. for the same , and the Prisoner was acquitted . One John Bullion was brought to the Bar , to be Tryed as a Popish Priest ; But Pleading he had formerly been tryed for the same before a Judge of an Assize and there Acquitted , his Trial was put off till the next Sessions . My Lord Lumley being Indicted for Recusancy , brought sufficient Evidence , that he had been at Divine Service , and taken the Sacrament according to the Church of England ; and thereupon Order was given for the withdrawing the said Indictment . There were Five Condemned ; viz . Elizabeth Owen , Margaret Adams , Frances Small , Jane Lant , and Charles Sancey . Four Burnt in the Hand . Three to be Transported . Two to be Whipt .
