She said , she had pawned these two rings to Mr. Tucker , and there was a dispute between him and her , as if she had not pawned them at all : there was Mrs . Pound 's silk purse with about twenty guineas in it ; and Mrs . Pound said , she had two three pound twelve shilling pieces in it : said I to Mr. Tucker , Did you ever see this purse ? Yes , he said ; said , I , Did you ever see this leathern purse ? Yes , he said , and he believed there were about 17 guineas in it . Mrs Pound said , she had two three pound twelve shilling pieces in the purse ; said I to the pawnbroker , How could you take these two gold rings in to pawn , when you saw this purse , and so much money in it ? Q . ( to Wright ) Where did you get this purse ? Wright . I found it at a house in Gibson 's Court , in Shug lane St. James 's under the stairs . Q . You talked about the Rings , and said there was some doubt whether they were pawned or not ? Wright . Yes . When I asked him about the Rings , he said he had none , till he saw the Prisoner , and she said she had given him a three pound twelve shilling piece to take twenty six shillings and four pence out of , which was owing for things the Prisoner had in pawn . She said he weighed the piece against another piece , and said it was a thirty six shilling piece , and that he said it was very pretty money , and said , have you got any more of them ; and she said she had another . She said before Sir Thomas De Veil that he gave her for that a guinea and a half , and 4 s. 6 d. in silver ; that when she pawned the rings , she had 3 in crown pieces , and that she gave him four of them and a shilling , and he gave her a guinea , for she wanted to change the money as fast as she could .

Sarah Cross . The Prisoner was in my house that day from two o'Clock in the afternoon till eight in the evening , in the common publick room . There was George Fell , who servant to the brewhouse , and some of his fellow servants had been drinking there all the afternoon . I but just delivered the tankard into George Fell 's hand , and went up stairs , and when I can known it was gone Q . Was the Prisoner drinking with them ? Sarah Cross . They had been drinking from two o'clock till that time , and they asked her to drink with them . Q . How long had you given the tankard to him before it was missing ? Sarah Cross . About five minutes ; for all the rest of his company was gone . Q . How came you to deliver the tankard into his hand just at that time ? Sarah Cross . I had been drinking with them , I went up stairs for something , and when I came down I missed the tankard ; I desired George Fell to seek after her . He went to search after her , and found the tankard at a pawnbroker 's in Hounsditch , he sent for me to come there , and I went and found her and the tankard there ; and then she fell down upon her knees and asked my pardon . George Fell . I am cooper to Mrs. Edwards 's brewhouse . About 5 or 6 of us were at the Angel Tap -house , belonging to the brewhouse , all the afternoon ; the Prisoner came in about two o'clock . Between three and four , says I , Mary , you are a fine servant to stay here all this afternoon ( for she said she was a servant , and lived next door to Dr. Bamber . ) She said she waited for the Bow coach . Some time after that I told her so again , and then she said all the family were in the country . I drank the last of our beer , and handed the tankard to Mary , the maid of the house ; this was about 8 o'clock , and at that time the Prisoner said to Mary , the maid draw me a tankard of beer , and the maid of the house went to draw it in a pewter tankard , the Prisoner made reply , Why do you draw it in a pewter tankard ? I and my fellow servants can drink out of a silver tankard as well as those men : the maid of the house said , a pewter tankard was as good as a silver one ; the Prisoner said , she would have a silver tankard , and I saw the maid bring the silver tankard up full , and set it down upon a little table in the room , and the Prisoner took the tankard off the table , and said , she would go into the little room by the bar ; and the maid of the house followed her the room , and came back to us . I said , Mary , there is a tankard of beer that she has had , which shall have to pay for , if you do not take care of it ; she went into the room the Prisoner went into , and said , Lord , Mr. Fell , there is no body there , and the candle is blown out ; said I , what is the tankard ? she said , I can not tell ; said I the candle and see ; she took the candle and looked , and the tankard was gone , and no body there : presently Mrs. Cross came down , and she said to me , for God 's sake go and look after the tankard ; said I , what can I do ? I can not do any thing in it , but she desired I would . I knew the Prisoner used to go sometimes to a place where she had an acquaintance , and I intended to go there ; but I thought as I went along , I would call at two or three pawnbrokers to try if I could hear any thing of it : I happened to go into a pawnbroker 's in Houndsditch , and said , there was a silver tankard lost from the Angel in Whitechapel , and asked if they had seen such a tankard , marked R.C.S . the man seemed in a surprise ; said I , you need not be in a surprise , for I have got the Prisoner , though I had not , but I said so , because I saw him in a surprise : said I , let me see the tankard , there 's nothing at all in that ; so he took the tankard out of a drawer from under the counter , and shewed it me : I said it was Mr. Cross 's tankard : he said , the person that brought it to him was an honest girl , for he had known her a great while , and told me that I must look after the Prisoner : I said , as I had seen the tankard , I would not trouble myself about it , for they should find out the Prisoner ; and in about an hour they found the Prisoner and brought her to the pawnbroker 's shop . John Smith . On the 2d of September about 8 o ' clock , the Prisoner brought this tankard to my house ; I had known her about seven or eight months , and she used to be a customer to us , and had a good character . She said she brought it from her sister , who keeps a public house in Skinner 's Street , and wanted to borrow 8 l. upon it , to pay the brewer the next morning . Q . Did she tell you whose tankard it was ? Smith . She said it was her sister 's tankard ; I said , I could not lend her so much upon it : she said , she had received 40 s. for her sister , and if I would lend her six guineas upon it , it would do , which I did , and in about ten minutes time a person came from Mr. Cross to inquire after it ; I went to inquire after her , and found her ; I sent to Mr. Cross 's directly , and they came and owned the tankard . Mr. Cross 's servant maid deposed , that she brought the tankard to the Prisoner , and the Prisoner said she had some company to come , and went into the little room by the bar ; that she went up stairs upon some occasion , and when she came down again , the Prisoner and the tankard were gone .

He brought out a pair of sheets , and a pair of ribbed stockings . Q . How far was Martin off at that time ? Bye . He might be half the length of the Court off . We went to Mrs. Lucas 's to sell them and she did not buy them ; then we went to the Prisoner Macklaughlin , otherwise Mason , otherwise Thomas , otherwise Little Moll , and asked her five shillings for them , she bid us eighteen pence , and at last gave us half a crown for them .

John Watland . I am a Sawyer , my house was broke open the 28th of July between 11 and 12 at night , the window shutters were cut away , and the bolts knocked off . Q . How do you know this ? Watland . I was at Gray 's in Essex when it was done , but my wife dreamed an ugly dream , that somebody had her gown on , and she came up to town ; and when I came to town two or three days afterwards , I found that my house had been broke open , and my windows nailed up again . I left every thing fast when I went out of town . Francis Crockett . This Jones and Mary Moore lived over my head . On Monday night the 28th of July , they came home about eleven o'Clock at night ; I did not see them bring any thing in then , but they went out again , and returned in about a quarter of an hour , and she came in with a bundle , and he had a kettle and something in it that rattled . They left these things in his apartment , and went out again , and the third time they came in with some sheets and other things , and then the clock struck twelve . Q . Did they bring a candle in with them then ? Crockett . No , she left a candle in the window the second time they were there . About five o'Clock they went out . Q . Did they carry these things with them ? Crockett . No , but they were carried out of the house . I got up about seven o'Clock , and saw that the window shutters had been cut open , so that I could put my hand in between the two window shutters , ( I made a complaint to the neighbours of it ; for Watland always desired us or some of the neighbours to give an eye to his windows whenever we went by , when he was out of town ) one pane of glass was broke , and the window shutter bedaubed with mud . The neighbours would have had me have taken out a warrant , but I did not care to do it till the Prosecutor came home . Jones went to Rag Fair to buy a bit of Salmon , and somebody who knew that I was going after him , bid him not come up the Lane ; so when he saw me , he threw the Salmon away , and put the dish under his arm , and run away . I found under the head of the Prisoner 's bed a large spike nail , a chissel , and this bunch of keys , [ some of them were pick lock keys ] I sent to Watland , but could not find out where he was . In about three weeks his wife came to town , and Jones confessed at Mr. Unwin 's house that he broke Watland 's house open about 12 o'Clock at night , but that he never should have done it if he had not been in liquor , and he owned the taking all these things . Prisoner Jones . As to that man ( Crockett ) he was in an information a little while ago , when Richard Studder was hanged . Mr. Unwin took him . Prisoner Moore . I have nothing to say to him , he is so roguish , I do not know what to say to him . Samuel Unwin . On the 29th of July Crockett came to me , and said , there was a poor man 's house broke open , and desired me to go with him to Jones 's house , for he did not care to go without me , for fear of coming into trouble . I went with him , and in the Prisoner 's room we found these things [ a bunch of keys , a large spike nail , and a chissel ] and a great part of the goods which the Prosecutor lost : I carried these things to my house , and in about three weeks time the Prosecutor and his wife came to town , and they came to my house ; I fetched the things down , and Watland said , they were his . I had intelligence that Jones used to make it his constant practice to go to St. Paul 's to pick pockets ; so I went into the middle isle of the church , and saw the Prisoner pass by me : I did not rightly know him , but he saw the Prosecutor , and so turned back again into the Isle ; I took hold of him and pulled him back , said I , is your name Samuel Jones ? he said , no ; said I , What is your name ? He said , my name is Elmore ; said I , you must come along with me . So I let him go , for I thought he would come along with me , and I was not willing to make a disturbance in the church ; he run away , I cried out stop thief , and he was taken presently , and was carried to my house ; he denied the fact for a considerable time , but afterwards he owned that he and Moore broke open the Prosecutor 's house between twelve and one , and took the things that were missing , and said , he was sorry that he should hurt a man he knew , and one he knew to be poor . Jones acquitted of the burglary , Guilty of the Felony . Moore Acquitted . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 311. James Leppard , of London , was indicted for stealing one pound and an half of tobacco , value 12 d. the goods of Persons unknown , Aug. 12th . Ebenezer Hartley . I am a Constable upon the Keys , about 11 or 12 at noon , I saw the Prisoner lurking about a hogshead of tobacco , at Butolph 's wharf ; I watched him , and saw him take some tobacco out of the hogshead : I followed him , and took him ; he said it was a very small matter , and hoped I would forgive him ; I said I would not , if it was never so little . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Hartley . He is a foreigner that works upon the Keys ; he is not a ticket porter . He has been a porter about a year . Joseph Atkins . The Prisoner works upon the Keys , I have employed him a great many times , my Lord , his character is very good , and I never knew him do any ill thing in my life . George Buckeridge . I have known the Prisoner thirteen years . I have intrusted him with fruit and other things in the warehouses . I have intrusted him with money , and he never wronged me of any thing in his life . Samuel Tatem . I am a gangsman . We are for the merchants , and the landwaiters are for the King . We put the goods into the warehouses , and lock them up , and if they do n't turn out right we make up the deficiency , and make every thing answerable , as they were when they came in . I have employed the Prisoner daily and hourly , and have intrusted him frequently , I have intrusted him with money , and I never found him to deceive me in any thing , but he was always just and true . Q . Is that his general character ? Samuel Tatem . I believe so . William Tinkler . I have known the Prisoner 3 years , and have intrusted him as my own servant . I have intrusted him to change gold , and never knew him to do any thing amiss ; and I would intrust him again , if he was clear . Hartley . My Lord , it is no wonder that these gangsmen speak for these persons , to encourage thieving , for they put them upon it . William Clack . ( A constable upon the keys ) I have known the Prisoner about a year and an half , and know him to be a reputed pilferer . He is one employed by these gangsmen to do what they call sweep for the soot ; that is , to work for what they can thieve or steal . Prisoner . I was informed by some lemon porters that there was some tobacco lay under some planks , and so I took it . Jury . I desire to know whether Hartley saw him take it out of the hogshead . Hartley . I saw him take it out of a hogshead , but I ca n't tell whose property it is , because there were more merchants than one concerned in that ship . Guilty 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 312. Richard Westfield , was indicted for stealing ten pound weight of sugar , val . 12 d. the goods of persons unknown , August 3 . William Clack . The Prisoner is a ticket porter , and was employed to hook the tackle to the hogsheads . I saw him bring this out of a lighter , at Wiggins 's key : one of the hogsheads was broke , but I ca n't say who broke it . I asked him how he came by it , he said one of the coopers gave it him . I enquired of the coopers whether it was so , but they would not own it to be truth . Q . Did they deny it ? Clack . They would not own it to be true . The Prisoner begged for God 's sake that I would forgive him , and said that he never did any such thing before . And before the Alderman he said he found it . Prisoner . I found it under the sheet of the lighter . Guilty 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 313. John Swinton , of London , was indicted for stealing fifteen yards of Scotch cloth . val . 12 s. the goods of James Cartwright , and Edward Tyson , July 29 . James Cartwright . The Prisoner was my porter , he lived with me about four months ; but the latter part of his time he was apt to stay out , and not come so early home as my hours required , which made me think he came by money dishonestly , and I was determined to part with him . I desired to look into his trunk , he refused it at first , but I told him if he would not open it , I would have it opened ; then he , with reluctancy , opened it , and this piece of Scotch cloth was in it ; he asked pardon , and said it was mine . I said , how can it be mine when it is in your trunk ? I looked on it and saw it was mine ; it was marked with characters . Prisoner . This piece of cloth lay some time in the cellar , and as I was brushing my clothes I was called up , and when I went down again I found this piece of cloth in my trunk , it might fall down into it by accident . And I did not know what to do with it , but had a design to keep it there , to give it to my master the first opportunity . Q. Excepting this , what is his general character ? Cartwright . I had a good character of him . They said he was a little given to drinking ; but if I had a strict hand over him , he might do very well . Q . Did he make the defence he does now , when you first found it out ? Cartwright . No , it is quite new . Guilty 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 314 . + John Moore , of Pancras , was indicted for assaulting , Sarah , the wife of John Price , on the King 's highway , putting her in fear and danger of her life , and taking from her one gold ring , val . 10 s. and 2 s. 8 d. in money , July 19 . Mary Price . On the 19th of July last coming by Bayswater , near Kensington in a chaise with Mrs. Sarah Taylor , about six or seven o'clock in the evening ( it rained prodigious hard . ) A person came up to the chaise with a crape over his face . Q . Is the Prisoner the person ? Sarah Price . Yes . Q . How did you see his face if he had a crape over it ? Price . He pulled his crape aside , as I suppose , to see who came each way . Then he demanded our money , and the gentlewoman who was with me , said , we have none . He damned us , and bid us give him what we had got . I said , I had 2 s. 8 d. and I gave it to him . Then he demanded Mrs. Taylor 's money , she gave it to me , and I gave it to the Prisoner . Q . How much was there ? Price . There was 7 d. Q . Did he take any thing else from you ? Price . He took two gold rings , and rode off as hard as he could ; we drove after him as hard as we could drive , till we saw two gentlemen ; I then stood upright in the chaise , and cried out , a highwayman , a highwayman , he has robbed me , and they rode after him and took him . Q . In how long time did they take him ? Price . I believe it could not be a quarter of an hour . Q . Was he never out of your sight ? Price . He was never out of my sight . I saw them pull him off his horse , then we stopped , and they brought the Prisoner up to us , and asked us if we knew him : I said , yes , he was the person that robbed us , and he owned the fact . Q . What did he say ? Price . He was asked whether he was the person that robbed us , and he said , yes , he was , but he hoped we would not prosecute him . Prisoner . I would ask the lady whether she knows me to be the man ? Price . Yes ; I saw your face , the crape was aside . This is the crape he had over his face . Sarah Taylor . The Prisoner is the man that robbed us , and he was brought back to us , and the gentlemen that took him asked him whether he was the man that robbed us , and he said , yes , he was the man , and hoped that we would not prosecute him . Mrs. Taylor being asked whether every part of Mrs. Price 's evidence was true , she said it was , so she was informed it was needless to relate the account of the robbery . Ralph Marsh . On Friday the 19th of July , myself in company with Henry Stevenson , were going to our respective homes . When we came to Tyburn turnpike , there was a cry of highwayman , ( it rained violently hard ) and the first person I saw was the Prisoner John Moore , on a black horse . I got into the same track , and rode after him , and did design to ride over him , but he turned out of the way , ( I suppose he was surprised to hear somebody so near him ) and my horse rode before him : I could not immediately stop my horse ; so soon as I would I turned my horse , and rode after him again , and he turned his horse against Mr. Stevenson 's . I caught hold of his right hand , and we both came down together . Upon this Mr. Stevenson and I secured him ; he asked what we wanted with him ; I said there was a hue and cry after him , and if he had done any thing amiss he must answer for it , and he should . He struggled a little , and desired us to let him go ; I told him I could not ; he said , then I am a dead man . I said , how do you know that ? He said it was the first robbery that ever he committed . I said it was too soon now , so Mr. Stevenson and I led him , he went between us , I laid hold of his left arm , and Mr. Stevenson of his right . In leading him along the road , he begged for mercy , and said he had robbed two women of a small trifle ; I think he said of about 18 d. or 2 s. and some half-pence , and two gold rings , and desired us to let him go . We carried him up to them , and Mrs. Taylor said , I thank you , Sir , that is the man that robbed us . We went to the White-hart , and had a pot of beer , and desired the women to let me know where I might call upon them . The Prisoner had a pistol in his pocket loaded with shot . I think he had about three shillings in silver and some brass . I asked where the rings were , he said he had put them into his pocket . I desired him to sit down , and told him if he would not sit down , I would tie him . So I searched his breeches for the rings , but could not find them . He said there were holes in his pockets , and they might get into the lining , so I unbuttoned the knees of his breeches and they dropped out . Q. to Henry Stevenson . Have you heard the evidence that has been given by Mr. Marsh ? Stevenson . Yes . Q . Is it true ? Stevenson . Yes . Q . Had he a pistol ? Stevenson . Yes ; it was in his right hand pocket , and I took it out . Prisoner . My Lord , I am a poor unfortunate unhappy fellow , it was the first fact that ever I committed . I never did any such thing in my life before , I never was a person that was extravagant in my life ; nor I never did any wrong to any person in my life . My wife and family were ill and in distress , and I was drove to necessity , and that brought me to this . Walter Collins . The Prisoner is a fan maker , he is a very honest man , and has paid me pounds for work that I have done for him . He followed the trade till it grew so bad , that he could not live by it , and then he took to other business . Q . What other business did he take to ? Collins . He kept a vine vault . I have done work for him within these two years , in putting up a sign in Bridges street ; he left that house and took another house in the Strand , but I did not do any thing for him there . Sarah Bigs . I have known the Prisoner about five years , he lodged with me about a year and a quarter : he was a journey-man then , in the business of fanstick making . Q . How long is that ago ? Bigs . It is about three years ago . Henry Deshorough . I have known the Prisoner about thirteen years , and have been pretty conversant with him till within these twelve months , and he had the character of a very honest man . Thomas Deshorough . I have had dealings with him , and he was always accounted a very honest man . Thomas Gurney . I am a perriwig maker .

I have known him about 7 years , and he always bore a good character , and the character of an honest man for whatever I heard . Thomas Simpson . I am a taylor . I have worked for him fifteen years . - I have not worked for him for four or five years last past . He always bore a good character , and I never heard a person speak ill of him in my life .

I found these two razors at Davis 's , and this razor I know to be my father 's , by reason of there being a bit broke off the end of the blade in trying to get it out of the handle . Prisoner . Gentlemen , I am quite unacquainted with the proceedings of this court , and therefore I hope you will excuse me if I say any thing that is contrary to the rules of this court . Mr. Davis did come to borrow a razor of me , and while I was with Mr. Blunt I borrowed some razors of him ( I think it was some time in October ) I would ask Mr. Blunt whether I did not desire to borrow some razors of him ? said he , there is a box of old razors , take what you will , and I took three ; I was going to get some oil to set them with , and he said he had got something in his house that would do as well , and he lent me that . Richard Blunt . Upon my oath I never lent him a razor in my life , or gave him one , and he never asked me for one . I did lend him a thing that we whet knives upon , but that is not fit for razors . Mary Ford . My daughter carried those things of Mr. Blunt 's over to his house , that were found at Mr. Mansell 's . Q . What things were they ? Ford . There were seven books , three razors , a hammer and a flower tub Mr. Burgess . I was informed that Mr. Blunt had a warrant against Mr. Mansell .

I have known him ever since he has been there , and he always behaved himself with a great deal of reputation and justice . Q . Do you know Richard Blunt ? Burgess . Yes , very well , and I know him to be a very malicious man , and loves to be litigious . Mr. Gilbert . ( the Headborough ) Blunt was 3 times at my house to bring me the warrant , but I was not at home . Mr. Mansell sent me a letter , and said he heard there was a warrant out against him from Mr. Blunt , and he said he would come to me , and he did come to me , and desired I would execute the warrant .

His character from all the gentlemen that ever I was in company with is that of an honest young man . Q . Do you think he would steal old razors and old books ? Gilbert . I believe he is as innocent of it as I am myself . Q . Do you know Mr. Blunt ? Gilbert . I have lived two years over against him , and his character is such , that if he could take any advantage he would , and I believe he would serve me the same . if he had an opportunity . Mr . Cope . I never knew a man of a better character in my life than Mr. Mansell , and that was the reason of my being his bail . Blunt said it might have been made up , if it had not been Mr. Mansell 's fault .

On the 19th of July , about 6 o'clock in the morning , the Prisoner brought four silver tea spoons to me , and she asked 8 s. upon them ; I said , if she would make them out to be her property I would lend her six shillings upon them . She said they were her sister 's . Seeing her in a little confusion I suspected her , and bid my boy go with her to her sister 's , but she did not carry him to her sister 's : and the boy brought her back to me , and then she owned whose they were ; and she gave me two more spoons , and told me whose they were ; she said they were Mr. Randall 's , in Bartholomew Cross .

Francis Blayer . These goods were in a warehouse belonging to Mr. Carne , I had not room to put them in my warehouse , so he gave me leave to put them into his , till I could get a chap to buy them ; and when I came to look for them , there were only thirteen bundles out of 47 . I discovered it first by this ; my wife sent a pair of muffatees to Mr. Avery to be died , and they were sent home in some of my paper . I enquired how he came by that paper , and he said he bought it of one Mr. Roberts . William Roberts . In November last , the Prisoner 's wife brought a parcel of this paper in loose sheets in her apron , and I gave her two pence farthing a pound , which is the common price for waste paper ; I had about three hundred weight of her , and I made use of it from November till the 17th of July , before I knew it was stole , and then Mr. Carne and Mr. Blayer came to me to know if I had got that paper : so I took the Prisoner and his wife up , and the remainder of the paper I had left , was returned to Mr. Carne 's house . I carried them before Sir Thomas Deveil , and he committed him , and discharged his wife : he was committed upon his own confession , he owned he sold great part of the paper himself . Q . Did he say he took it ? Roberts . He said he was ruined and undone forever . Q . What business is the Prisoner ? Roberts . He is a carver by trade . Charles Carne . The Prisoner worked with me two years , and when Mr Blayer brought this cargo , which was a very large one , I told him , I had a large warehouse to put it into , and I did not think any of my men would take it ; the front of the pile always remained whole , and they had taken it away behind , and had as it were scooped it . Mr. Blayer said , Mr. Carne here is but very little paper left , here are but thirteen bundles ; I said to the Prisoner , you had better confess the fact ; and he said , he had sold between four and five hundred weight to one ; I have three hundred , three quarters , eleven pound and a half , which he had sold to Mr. Ninn . When the Prisoner worked for me , he always behaved very well . I paid him a guinea a week , and when he worked piece work , I have paid him 25 or 30 l. a week . I would employ him again if he was at liberty , to make any work at home . John Ninn . My servant bought two parcels of paper of the Prisoner of about half an hundred weight each , and I paid him for a third of about half an hundred , and there were several other parcels that he brought afterwards . Francis Blayer . I sold the thirteen bundles to Mr. William Rayner , for 32 l. 16 s. which makes my whole loss , according to that computation , amount to 85 l. Charles Carne . The Prisoner said , he cut the sheets so , as to put them into his pocket or into his breast , for if he had carried never so little a thing openly , I must have seen it , as he came out . Prisoner . I never stole any of the paper , but it was brought me , and I sold it . Godwin Prime . I asked him , ( I think it was in New Prison ) how he came to do so , and he said the devil possessed him : he said , he took the paper by piece-meal , and desired to speak with Mr. Crane and Mr. Blayer . I have entrusted him with a great deal , and he always had a good character ; and I would employ him again , that is , if he made any goods at home , I would buy them of him . The indictment being laid for stealing them in the warehouse of Francis Blayer , and it appearing they were stole in the warehouse of Charles Carne , He was acquitted of privately stealing in the warehouse , which is a capital offence , and found guilty of the felony only .

Nicholas Grayley . I am a bricklayer and plaistrer . Some time in January last , I had been at Mr. Sparks 's house in Phoenix Street , Spittle Fields , with a neighbourly club ; I pulled out my watch to see what it was o'clock , and it was past eleven , and I went away , and at the corner of Buttermilk Alley , cross Phoenix Street I wanted to make water , and this woman [ the Prisoner ] wanted to have a buss of me , and she put one of her hands round my neck , and the other to my fob , and pulled my watch out , I felt it going , and missed it immediately , I put my hand upon her gown , and took hold of it ( she had a printed linen gown on at that time ) she turned round , and gave me a blow upon my hand , and made me leave my prize ; the place was a little slippery , and with that and the blow she gave me , I fell down upon my two hands ; upon which she run away , and I do not know which way she took . The next morning I went to the Justice 's clerk to get a warrant for her , but I could not find her , she kept out of the way and I have not seen her since till about three weeks ago , when I was watching some goods for the landlord , I saw her go by , and took her up . Q . Was the Prisoner at the house that you was in ? Grayley . Yes , I found out who she was , and I went to her mother 's , and her mother told me she had not been at home all night , and said , she was a sad creature . Prisoner . When did you miss your watch ? Grayley . I missed it immediately , and took hold of your gown directly . Q . How can you be sure she is the person ? Grayley . I saw her face very plain in Buttermilk Alley . Q . Was it light or dark ? Grayley . It was between dark and light . Q . Did you return back to the house afterwards ? Grayley . Yes . Q . And did you complain that you had lost your watch ? Grayley . When I went into the house , the woman of the house said , Mr. Grayley , I suppose you have lost your watch , and I said , yes madam , I have . William Sparks . I keep that house ; the Prosecutor and the Prisoner were in my house that evening . Q . Were they in company together ? Sparks . Only in publick company , in the publick room . The Prosecutor went out first , and in eight or ten minutes , as near as I can guess , the Prisoner soner went out after him : I wondered that he was gone , so went to look for him in the yard , but he was not there : as I was going to shut up the windows , he came and gave me a blow cross the back with his cane ; said I , what is that for , Mr. Grayley ! and then I heard a noise about the watch , and that he had lost it . Q . Did he declare when he came back that he had lost his watch ? Sparks . When he struck me cross the back he did not say any thing about the watch , but pushed into the house directly , and then the company were all gone except his wife and another . Grayley . Did not I ask you what the woman 's name was ? Sparks . Yes , and I told you her name . Q . Were they in liquor or not ? Sparks . Indeed , to my belief , neither the Prosecutor nor the Prisoner were sober . Prisoner . His wife was drunk and lay cross two or three chairs . Ann Owen . I have known the Prisoner a great while , she takes in dubbling , and goes out frequently with heavy loads , and if she was a bad creature she would hardly work so hard . Ann Rot . I have known the Prisoner three quarters of a year , and I never knew any harm of her . Mary Cooper . She lived with me two years and an half , and I had things of great value , and she never wronged me of any thing ; and when work was slack , I know she and her child have lived a day upon a pennyworth of Leg of Beef . Mary Lynch . I have known her these eight years , I have sent her many a time with my husband 's watch , and she was always very honest ; but I have heard there is money for taking her . John Marioge . I am one of the Headborough 's of the parish of Christ Church , where this fact was committed ; and very often we are disturbed by people in that passage , and I do say it is impossible to swear to the face of a person in that place , for there is never a lamp in it . I would do the fair thing by every body , and that is the reason of my speaking in this affair . Sparks . It is a dark ugly place , and it is difficult to distinguish a person 's face there ; and if there is a lamp in the day , it is knocked down in the night . Acquitted . 321 . + Richard Locker , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Thompson on the King 's highway , putting her in fear , & c. and taking from her two cambrick caps laced , val . 2 s. a cambrick handkerchief , val . 2 s. and a linen handkerchief , val . 3 d. the goods of Alexander Buchannan , Aug. 31 .

Just below Charing Cross , he came up from those fellows , and gave Mrs. Thompson a slap on the face . Q . Was it pretty hard ? Blackwell .

The young lad finding they were gone , run after them again , and overtook them , and laid hold of them again , and called for my assistance to lay hold of them again , and I carried them back to the watch * . They never talked of losing these things at first , but when they were retaken , then they talked of this robbery and losing these things ; then we carried them to the Round-house . * It is very strange that the constable nor any other of the Watchmen would appear ; and it is to be hoped the character of this Watchman will be enquired into by the Gentlemen of the parish . Q . Who ordered you to carry them to the Round house ? Prior . They had liberty to go home to their beds , and the boy was confined . Q . How came they to be set at liberty , and the boy confined ?

Mrs. Thompson made answer ; Gentlemen , I was frightened with the slap that was given me on my face , and the woman that was with me said , I had better lose the thing than go to the Round-house , for I never was in trouble in my life ; and when I came to the Watch-house , the mob said , knock the Scotch bitch down ; I was frightened , as I was with child ; and Mrs. Blackwell said , you had better come back than lose your own life and the child 's , if you lose your things . Q . How came you to go out of the Round-house ? Thompson . I never was in the Round-house . Q . Where did the women make their escapes from the watch ? Prior . Going to the Watch-house .

These two witnesses were committed by Sir Samuel Gower on suspicion , but I could not swear against them , because I was not sure that they were the persons that robbed me , but as to the Prisoner I am positive . Daniel Kalisall [ He was called for by the Prosecutor . ] I have known Ford Bolley eight or nine years , he is a jeweller by trade , and I look upon him to be a very honest man . I have trusted him with forty or fifty pounds worth of goods together . There were other persons of credit ready to give the Prosecutor a character .

William Thornton . On the 18th of June last , about 3 o'clock in the afternoon , I was robbed of 14 guineas and an half , which was in a purse in my pocket . Q . When was it done ? Thornton . I went into a house called the Hayfield , in the back lane by Rag Fair , and called for a pint of beer and a pipe , and smoaked my pipe of tobacco . This Winifred Ward was standing at the bar , and I took her to be the landlady of the house , I drank to her , and she pledged me . After that she sat down opposite against me in a little box ; then Jane Johnson came in and sat by her , and they persuaded me to have a quartern of - I ca n't think of the name , rosa solis , no ; it is not rosa solis , it is some Irish name I think ; - usqucbaugh , ay , that is the name of it . Afterwards they persuaded me to go to a little room where this Winifred Ward lay . We all three went and sat down upon the bed side together , and then we had another quartern of the same liquor . I found it worked in my head a little , then this Jane Johnson sat by me a quarter of an hour , and she persuaded me to go to her chamber 3 or 4 doors higher up in the lane : a chamber where I suppose she has carried many an one . Winifred Ward led me the way , and carried me there , into the chamber ; so I called for a bottle of beer , and a woman brought it up and sat it down , but I never tasted it ; then Winifred Ward hugged me and kissed me ; and I lay down upon the bed with her , and had a roll there , Then she pretended to go for a pair of sheets , and as soon as she got off the bed , I felt for my money , and it was gone . Q . How long after she was gone , was it before you missed it ? Thornton . It was immediately after . So I run after her , but I could not find her . Q . Did you miss your money in the other house ? Thornton . No , I did not miss it till I came there . I went to the house I was in first , and made my complaint there , and they said they knew nothing of it , but they were sorry for it . Winifred Ward was taken up the 29th of July ; and as to Jane Johnson I do n't know what to say , whether she took it as she sat along side of me , or whether the other took it , I ca n't tell . Q . Have you had your money again ? Thornton . No , I have had none of it again . Both acquitted . 325 . + Mary York , of St. Andrew , Holborn , was indicted for stealing three silver spoons , val . 6 s. and two gold rings , val . 3 l. the goods of Sarah Taylor , in her dwelling house , July 26 .

My employ is making bandboxes for the milliners . I had been out , and when I came home I looked in my chest , and missed my things . Q . How did she get in ? Taylor . She had a key to get in to work . Q . Have you got your things again ? Taylor . Yes , I found her the next day at her mother 's . She denied it at first , but afterwards she owned she took them . I believe she never wronged me before . Guilty 10d . [ Whipping . See summary . ] 326.

I lost these things . The Prisoner came in for half a pint of beer , and I drawed it for her ; she said I will not pay you for it now , I will pay you for it by and by , and what I owe you besides . She came in again in a little time , and my servant drawed her half a pint more , and she paid for that , and came for another half pint afterwards . My servant said to me , do you know any thing of the porridge pot ? I said , no . She said the things were there just now , and there has been no body here but Mary Herring , and she must have them . I went to her and the said my servant lent them to her , and that they were at Mr. Birch 's . I went to Mr. Birch 's , and there I found them . James Birch .

I had taken two guineas from them the 19th , and on the 21st I lost the other two . The Prisoner confessed at Mr. Bird 's ( Sir William Billers 's clerk ) that he took them . Q . How do you know that those two guineas did not want something of weight ? There are a great many guineas that are not worth twenty shillings . Hutchins . The Prisoner is a painter , and worked in the house . Q . Have you had your money again ? Hutchins . Yes ; one guinea and 4s . 6d . which he owned was part of the money he took out of the window . Thomas Wheatley , The Prisoner was my servant , I sent him to Mrs. Hewitt 's to paint a garret window . My wife informed me there were two guineas lost there out of the room .

Richard Wilson . Last night as I was going down the Minories , Mary Green took me hold by the coat , and asked me if I wanted a pretty girl , I said , no , I have a wife of my own ; she said , by G - d you shall have a girl , for I have got a very pretty girl in my house . I gave her a pretty handsom slap upon the hoop or the gown , or whatever she had on , and then out came another girl . Q . Where was this ? Wilson . It was just by her own house . Q . What time was it ? Wilson . It was a little before 12 at night . The other girl took me by the left skirt of the coat , which we call the lar-board skirt ( I ask pardon for the expression , as I am a tar , I hope you will excuse me ) she took me by the collar , and forced me up an alley , and then forced me into a house . Q . Who forced you into the house ? Wilson . I was forced into the house by Mary Green , and another woman , who is not taken [ Moll Boston ] When they had got me into the house , they sat me down gently into a chair , they did not hurt me at all . Then Mary Green took hold of this left arm , and as she had hold of my arm , there was a door on the left hand which two chaps jumped out of . Q . What sort of chaps were they ? Wilson . Why men ; one of them was a d - m lusty fellow , the other was but a little man , one of them took hold of my right leg , and hove it up , and one of the women who is gone [ Moll Boston ] took hold of me , and a man in a striped waistcoat got hold of my collar and tore my shirt all to pieces . I did not care to give out very soon , so they tore me all to pieces . Q . What did you see Mary Green do ? Wilson . She was so good as to hold my arm , and one of the men took hold of my collar , and the other of my right leg ; and that pale sickly woman [ Ann Girle ] who pretends to be sick , but she is just as sick as I am , much the same ; I believe she is mistress of the house . She took hold of me , and said she would put me to bed , and then the tall girl with the black hair [ Walker ] she is a pretty girl enough ; she said she would shew me the way up stairs . Then Ann Girle , as soon as she had got hold of me , put the candle out , and my pocket was picked . This gentlewoman here [ Green ] had hold of my arm . Q . How much money did you lose ? Wilson . I lost fifteen guineas , a half crown piece , two shillings in silver , and some half-pence . Then this lady , who stands in the middle , Ann Walker , said , you shall not stay to lose all , take care of yourself . Q . Did they light the candle again ? Wilson . Yes ; the mistress of the house , Ann Girle , lighted it . Indeed she was very civil , she lighted it presently : I believe the candle was not out above ten minutes . Q . When the candle was lighted again , was Ann Walker so near you as to put her hand round your neck ? Wilson . She had her hand about my neck after the candle was out , and she said , my dear , take care of yourself , and you shall not be hurt . Then I called out , and the two women took and hove me out of doors . Q . Who assisted in putting you out of the house ? Wilson . Why the two men , a little one and a tall one , Mary Green and Ann Walker . When I got out of the house , I set my back against a bulk and called to the watch , and I told the watch that minute , that I had lost 15 guineas , but I do n't believe that I mentioned any silver at all . The watch took Mary Green and Ann Walker at the pump in the street . I desired the watch to break the house open , and they told me they could not . They went for the constable , and he said he could not ; but when Green and Walker were brought back to the house , then the door was opened . Q . Where had you been ? Wilson . I had been at the Saracen 's head within Aldgate , where I lodge . Q . Was you quite sober ? Wilson . I was as sober as I am now . Q . How long was it before that time , that you had your money ? Wilson . About an hour . I brought the money from Sherness . Q . When did you come from Sheerness ? Wilson . I came from Sheerness on Tuesday , and I believe it was twelve o'clock yesterday morning when I came here , and I went to Mr. Busby 's in Doctor 's Commons with a ticket of 33 l. which was my brother 's . Prisoner Green . I desire to know whether you did not leave your watch in pledge at the watchhouse for a shilling , for some liquor ? Wilson . Yes , I did , my Lord , and I saved my watch by chance , it was by mere accident , for the string was got into the inside of my breeches . John Lee . I am a watchman of Portsoken ward , Mr. Wilson had called out for the watch . Q . Where was it that you saw Mr. Wilson first ? Lee . It was in Well Alley in the Minories with another watchman . Mr. Wilson desired us to break open the door , I told him we could not break the door open . Then he said he would have a watchman stand all night at the door , and insisted upon it , and said he had lost fifteen guineas , and shewed me the house . Then Warner , a watchman , came and said , he believed the two women were passed by . I saw them , but they were then in the liberty of the little Minories , and I could not take them . But they came to the pump to drink , which is in our ward , and then Warner and I took them and carried them to the watch-house . When they came there , and finding no body that knew them , they began to be saucy . Then I fetched Mr. Wilson , and he came to the watch-house , and said , those were the women that robbed him . Ann Green said that Nan Girle was to have five shillings in the pound of Tom Boston * , out of what they plundered Mr. Wilson of . * He is the tall fellow that Mr. Wilson speaks of who took him by the collar and tore his shirt . He belongs to the Foot Guards now in the Tower . He was taken by Mr. Wilson on Monday the 16th instant , at the corner of Houndsditch . Arthur Parker . ( a watchman ) As I was beating the hour past twelve , Mr. Wilson called to me and said he was robbed of 15 guineas . I went into Well Alley with him , he found the door , and said , here is the place where I was robbed . Said he , watchman , break the door open , I said I could not ; but if it was upon a cry of murder , I do n't know what I might do . He staid there , and I went and fetched the watch and the constable directly . That is all I have to say in the full course of the matter . Q . Did you see them at the watch-house ? Parker . I saw Walker and Green in the watchhouse first , and afterwards I saw all three there . Q . Was you present when they got the door open ? Parker . No , I was not . William Matthews . ( constable ) About 12 o'clock our watchmen came to me , to go to a house in Well Alley , about a gentleman who was robbed . I saw the gentleman [ Mr. Wilson ] and spoke to him . He said he was robbed of fifteen guineas , and desired I would break the door open . I told him I could not without a warrant . I knocked at the door with my staff , but could not get the door opened ; he said if I would let two men stand at the door all night , he would pay them for it ; so I let two watchmen stand there , and they stood I believe about an hour , and then Walker and Green came by and were taken . Q . Who lives there ? Matthews . That woman , Ann Girle . Q . How long has she lived there ? Matthews . She has lived there but since Monday . It is a very bad house ; people come in and stay about a fortnight or three weeks , then they are gone and others come in . Prisoner Walker . Was not I walking down the Minories when I was taken ? Matthews . I did not see you in the Minories . The first time I saw you , was when you were brought to the watch-house . Q . Were they searched ? Matthews . No , they were not searched , and I believe the person who had the money is got off . Ebenezer Cartwright , ( a watchman . ) Parker called me and told me a gentleman was robbed of fifteen guineas . We went to Ann Girle 's house , and Walker and Green went with us to the door , and they knocked at the door , and Nan Girle said , who is there ? they said , they were ; she said , is there no body else ? and they said , no . Then she opened the door , and we went in and took her . Girle said that Tom Boston and his lady had robbed the gentleman . Then said Mary Green to her , must we go to Newgate for you , when you are to have a crown in the pound , out of the money they robbed the gentleman of ? Q . Where was this discourse ? Cartwright . It was in the watch-house . Prisoner Green . Did you ever know me to be a prostitute or a street walker ? Cartwright . I do n't know you . Green to Matthews the constable . Do you know me to be such a person ? Matthews . I have seen you twenty times about the streets . Prisoner Green , to Wilson . Where was it that I picked you up ? Wilson . I ca n't justly say where , for I am unacquainted with that way ; it was about the Minories . That lady was so kind as to take hold of the skirt of my coat . Green . Is the woman here that picked you up ? Wilson . Yes , to be sure she is , if you are here . Green . Was it I that picked you up , or the other woman who is not here ? Wilson . It was yourself , you was in a black gown then , but you have changed your colours now ; I know the scar in your face very well Green . He said , Polly , I have been ill used , my shirt is torn ; said I , I am sure you shall not be ill used . Prisoner Walker . Green and I were at supper that night upon a couple of rabbets at a neighbours . Elizabeth Warren . Walker and Green were at supper at my house last night ; and you supped there too , [ speaking to one Sarah White . ] Sarah White replied , Not I indeed , I did not sup with you . Q . Who else supped with you ? Warren . Rosamond Blackwell . Q . Was Mary Boston there ? Warren . No , she was not . Q . [ to White . ] What are you ? White . I get my living by selling things in the streets ; my husband has belonged to the Customhouse there twenty five years . Last night we went to bed about 8 o'clock , and about 12 there was an uproar which waked us , and a gentleman came to the door ; he had a pair of white stockings , a red waistcoat , and I think a blue grey coat ; he said he was robbed of fifteen guineas . There were three watchmen , and the gentleman would not let the watchmen go : there were some people came to call one Sarah Dobbs ; and they said , you must come to Mary Gordon to the Watch-house ; but I find now she is prosecuted by the name of Green . Q . Was the candle put out before , or after the robbery ? Wilson . It was put out just at the time , for the men and the women had hold of me then . The candle was put out just at the same instant that I was robbed . Ann Girle and Ann Walker Acquitted . Mary Green , Guilty , Death . 331 . + Christopher Hall , of London , was indicted for the murder of John Furness an infant , about the age of four years , by feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , driving and forcing a cart with one horse against the said John Furness , by which forcing and driving , the off wheel went over the head of the said John , and broke his skull , of which he soon afterwards died , July 17th . Mr. Furness . I am the father of the child . On the 17th of July I found my child dead about six in the evening , and was informed that it died about five o ' clock ; he had a bruise upon his head by the wheel , from which the brains came out up on his waistcoat . George Reith . I am a barber . On the 17th of July the Prisoner was driving his cart along Shoe Lane , and there was a child about three years old going along , the child endeavoured to get out of the way , but could not , and the wheel run over his head . Q . What was the consequence of that ? Reith . It killed the child . Q . In what manner did the Prisoner drive his cart ? Reith . Very slow . Q . Was the Prisoner by his horse 's head ? Reith . I believe he was upon the shafts of his cart . Q . Did the child cry out ? Reith . No . Q . Do you think the Prisoner saw it ? Reith . I believe he did not see it . Furness , ( the child 's father ) I really do think the Prisoner did not see the child , for if he had , I believe he would not have done it ; I will speak so much in favour of the Prisoner . Prisoner . I was driving an empty cart with one horse , I had the misfortune to be lame at that time , and was riding upon the shafts of the cart . I am very sorry for what has happened . The Jury acquitted him of the murder , and of manslaughter on the Coroner 's inquest , and brought in their verdict accidental Death . The Court reprimanded him for riding upon the shafts of his cart , and hoped it would be a warning to him for the future . 332.

I was in Mr. Leake 's kitchen , and saw the Prisoner come down stairs , and go out with one of my mistress 's gowns under her cloak ( I did not see her come in or take them ) I went after her , and she dropped the two gowns from under her cloak ; she went to strike me in order to get away , but a man came up with a wooden leg , and stopped her . Robert Leake . I was sent for , and when I came home , I asked the Prisoner how she came to do it , she said she was weary of her life , and wanted to be transported ; and thought she could live better abroad than here , and gave me a slap on the face .

John Smith . I live at the hat and feather in Long Lane , on the 9th of this month , about three quarters of an hour after four in the morning , I found my shop had been broke open ; the iron bar of the window was broke . Q . Can you say what day you saw it safe over night ? Smith . I can not say that : I lost twenty one hats out of my shop ; I missed them about a quarter of an hour after I got up . I went to some pawnbrokers to desire them to stop them if any were brought to them , and in about half an hour 's time a messenger came from Mr. Edwards a pawnbroker , to let me know he had stopped a hat , and desired to know if it was mine . I went to Mr. Edwards 's , and there was the Prisoner James ; I said to him , young man , did you bring this hat to the pawnbroker 's ? he said , yes ; I asked him , how he came by it ? he said , he made a purchase of it ; I asked him , where ? he said , in Smithfield ; I asked him , who he bought it of ? he said , of a drover ; that he held it upon a stick , and asked , who would buy a hat ? and he bought it ; I asked him if he wanted a hat this morning ? he said , yes ; then said I , how came you to pawn it ? I told him , I did not like that way of proceeding , and that I would charge him , if he did not give a better account how he came by it . I went with him into Mr. Edwards 's room , and he said , he would tell me the truth ; he said he went to sleep in a hay loft , and a man came and pulled him by the arm , and desired he would pawn it for two shillings . John Edwards . Last Monday morning James and Edwards two of the Prisoners at the bar , came and offered this hat to pawn for two shillings ; I had heard that Mr. Smith had been robbed of some hats , so I sent the hat to him , and he owned it .

This dozen of soles I found at William King 's at Newington ; this sack of leather was left with an old gentleman , who told me , the Prisoner left it with him , and when I came to open it , I found every individual to be my property . The Prisoner according to his own information had taken one , two , three , or four pair of shoes a week , and he owned , that a great many of his master 's goods were at one William King 's at Newington , and several of them were found there ; this King has absconded ever since .

And that he , the said Thomas Morgan , her the said Elizabeth his wife , her the said Elizabeth his wife , feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , did kill and murder , against his Majesty 's peace , his crown and dignity . He was a second time charged by virtue of the coroner 's inquisition , for the wilful murder of the said Elizabeth his wife . Thomas Morgan . On Monday the 19th of August , the Prisoner desired me to come and burn a kiln of pipes for him . Q . Are you any relation to the Prisoner ? Morgan . None at all . I was burning some pipes for him at his house in Bedford Bury , by Covent Garden . ( I know they have had quarrels concerning jealousy . ) She washed in the morning , and he went out with some pipes . He came home about 4 or 5 o'clock , and says to her , Bet , this is the best half guinea I ever laid out in my life , for I have been to ask counsel ( for she had bound him over for assaulting her ) and I am not afraid that you can hurt me or my bail ; for he was bailed out of the Gatehouse , and that bred a sort of a quarrel between them , and he took all the wet linen that was in the washing tub , and bundled them up in a bundle , and would not let her have them ; so they quarrelled for a considerable time . There were three women of our trade came to the Prisoner 's house in the evening , and the Prisoner and his wife were pretty sociable , and he sent for me to drink with them . About 11 o ' clock after the company was gone , I was in the stoke hole , and they were standing looking at me ; As they were standing looking at me , he said , Bet , let me have a buss , and make all up , for said he , it is a sad thing we should be always quarrelling and differing ; and , as he said , he went to buss her , and she put his hand away from her , but he took a buss from her partly by force , and he had a buss . She said , Tommy , I can hardly buss you , for I can not love you . He stood in a pause : well , Bet , said he , if it is so that you can never value me nor respect me , it is the best way for us to separate : there is a 30 l. bond you carried to your father , I have received 15 l. and there is 15 l. coming to me , only let me have that 15 l. and I will resign the trade up to you , and go and travel the country as a journeyman , and take my chance ; and I will give you a bond never to trouble you , and you shall give me a bond never to trouble me . Then said she , I will agree to it , and I will take the business into my own hand . Then said he , I will tie you up from one thing , that you shall not employ John Hartley ; ( that is the man he was jealous of ) Then she made answer , I will not be confined from that , for he is the only person I choose to work for me , and if I can not be allowed that I will not agree to it . Then he fell a dancing and capering , and said , then it is all off if you will employ him , and fell a singing directly . After that they had some punch , he went out and ordered it . They said there was 18 d. worth , and he drank to me in the stoke hole , and they had no words after that . Said he , Morgan , I have got some pipes that were burnt slack before , and I would have these burnt harder ; and he brought me 4 pieces of a coach wheel to burn them harder . Then he came and said , come up and drink your punch , and he stoked down for me , for he said , you are quite hot . I said , I am quite wearied out , I will go to bed . He said , I will stay a little longer , for I love my fire to be out before I go to bed ; but I being quite tired went to bed . Q. Pray did you hear when it was that the woman was murdered ? Morgan . No , I lay in the garret , I went and left him singing ; for I was a little in liquor . Q . What time did you go to bed ? Morgan . About twelve o'clock , and lay till between eight and nine the next morning . When I got up I came down stairs , and he complained for want of pipes to serve his customers . I went to open this kiln of pipes to let them cool , and in the mean time the woman at the Cock and Bottle came over and said our bing is full of foul pipes and will not hold any more . I said I will go and take them away ; and there being some company , I staid about an hour , and I said it is a strange thing they should not get up . Q . Did you see your master in the morning ? Morgan . No , I never saw him after I left off burning . Q . You say your master told you he wanted pipes for his customers , when was that , over night , or in the morning ? Morgan . It was over night . Q . What time did you go out in the morning ? Morgan . I believe it was about nine o'clock , and I staid there till between two and three o ' clock expecting their coming down . Then I bored a hole in the wall of their chamber and looked through , and saw no sheet upon the bed . I bored another hole , which directed me to the middle of the room , and then I saw a puddle of blood in the middle of the room . Seeing that , I pushed the door a little to look farther in , and I saw two naked legs lying on the floor on the farther side of the bed . I run down stairs to this gentlewoman [ Mrs. Moody ] and said , for God 's sake come up , there is murder in the house , for Morgan has killed himself ; she went up and looked upon her as she lay , and thought that he was murdered . Q . Was the body naked ? Morgan . Yes ; the body was naked . Q . Did she lay at the side of the bed , or under the bed ? Morgan . At the side of the bed . Q . What reason had you to think it was him that was murdered ? Morgan . I judged it to be him because there was no cap on ; and I thought he had made away with himself . Then several women came up stairs . What do you talk , said they , of his being murdered ? it is she that is murdered . And they said to somebody , do you go down and take care of the doors , and call some of the neighbours , and when some of the substantial neighbours came , I was secured , and sent to the Gatehouse . Q . What room did you find the deceased in ? Morgan . In a room up two pair of stairs . Q . Where is the shop ? Morgan . It is up one pair of stairs . Q . You say you was a little in liquor , and you went to bed ? Morgan . Yes , I was a little in liquor , and that was the reason I went to bed so soon . Q. Pray did you see in what condition the body was ? Morgan . I saw the body , but I did not see any wound upon it , for I run down stairs to call the neighbours ; and I never saw her afterwards . [ The Coroner said there was a matter of 20 wounds on the body , and 3 of them were mortal . ] Q . Did you hear any noise or any strugling during the whole night ? Morgan . I did not hear any . Mary Ann Moody . On Tuesday about 3 o ' clock in the afternoon , this man [ the evidence ] came to me , and said , that he was frightened . I said , what have you seen ? He said , he had looked through the key hole , and had seen some blood in the room . So I went to call some of the neighbours . Q . What time was this ? Moody . It was about three o'clock in the afternoon on the Tuesday . Q . Where did she lay then ? Moody . She lay on the floor on her right side , with her face towards the bed . Q . Was she naked ? Moody . Her shift was pulled up to her neck , and she was bare headed . Q . Had she any wounds upon her body that you observed ? Moody . Yes , I observed several . Q . Can you give any account where the wounds were ? Moody . I believe she had three on the side of her belly , six along her throat , and she had a great many behind her ear . Q . Had she any other wounds ? Moody . Yes ; but I did not take any particular notice of them . Q . Did you hear any noise in the night ? Moody . Yes ; I am sure I heard her cry out murder . Q . Did she do it more than once ? Moody . Yes . Q . What time was that ? Moody . The watch called two o'clock , and a quarter before that she was crying something about justice . Q . Could you hear every thing that was said or done in the house ? Moody . Pretty well . Q . What did you hear further ? Moody . I heard a sort of a groaning . Q . Was you pretty conversant with them ? Moody . I was very often with them . Q . Did they agree well , or how did they live ? Moody . They were always falling out , and she crying murder . Prisoner . That woman knows no more of me than the farthest woman in this court . Did you ever know any neighbour that could give me an ill word about abusing my wife ? Moody . All the people in the Bury will say the same as I say . Prisoner . If I could handle my pen , I could take minutes of this , and be able to consute her . William Ellis , Surgeon . On Wednesday the 21st of August about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I saw the body of the deceased lie prostrate on her back upon the bed . Q . As you are a surgeon , I desire you would give an account of the wounds ? Ellis . I will give you the best account I can , and I do n't doubt but I shall give your Lordship and the Jury satisfaction . I viewed the body and found there had been an attempt to cut her throat , the common teguments and the skin appearing about one inch over the windpipe . There was one wound upon each hand , by which I imagined she had attempted to save herself . Those wounds were on the back of her hands to the bone , as deep as they could be , but about two inches long each . There was a wound under the left ear , and I observed by her defending her throat so well , that the wound by the ear must be given underhanded by a sort of a job , and by my probe I found it to be four inches and an half in depth ; and I judged that wound to be given obliquely , and to have divided the jugular artery , and must have been the cause of her death ; for it is a very large vessel ( her shift was as bloody , as if it had been dipped in blood . Q . What were those wounds given by ? Ellis . I suppose by some sharp instrument ; upon examining the body I found three punctured wounds , one on the left breast , which must have reached the heart , and a portion of the lungs about two inches deep and half an inch broad ; I believe it penetrated into the heart , and touched a portion of the lungs ; as near as I could judge by my probe it was about two inches deep : there was another wound much in the same angle below that , of the same breadth ; which , upon examining with my probe , I judged to be of the same depth , and I believe touched the lower part of the heart , and penetrated into the heart itself : on the side of the belly I saw another wound much of the same breadth , into which I introduced my probe , which is about five inches and an half long , up to the head of it , but that lower wound I do not take to be mortal , though it was so deep , for it went superficially and sideways , but I do not think the intestines were wounded , but the other three wounds I apprehend to be mortal ; I am sure they are . Q . Did you observe any other wounds ? Ellis . There were several slighter wounds , but I did not examine them : upon observing the wound at the bottom of the breast , I proposed opening the body several times to the Jury , but they thought it needless , they were so well satisfied . There was a stream of blood that run from the body , which was coagulated : a stream , as if a person had been killing an ox , and must have come from the heart , and was the occasion of her death . William Walker . ( the father of the deceased ) On the 17th of July my daughter came to me to make her complaints , tho ' I had not seen her for two years before . She told me her grievance with relation to her husband 's usage . Q . Give an account Sir , of what you know of your own knowledge . Walker . The Prisoner called upon her , and said , Bett , come home , I can not go on with my business without you ; she said , Tom , if I do you will use me as you used to do . On the 30th of July we met at the Cock and Bottle in Bedford Bury , and had some discount about the affairs that used to happen , and he promised he would be better than he had been . This passed till the 9th of August , and then I had a letter from her , wrote by one John Adams , a journeyman , who worked there , begging me to come up , and rectify matters ; acquainting me , that he had struck her upon the breasts in such a manner , that it appeared to be mortal : I came up at her request , and he promised amendment . When I saw her breasts they were as black as any woman 's breasts could be ; I advised her to go to Sir Thomas Deveil , which she did , and he granted her a warrant , and upon her oath , Sir Thomas sent him to the Gate-house . Prisoner . Did not she carry 20 l. away , and did not she take a bond of 30 l. that you gave me ? She robbed me , and carried my effects away . Walker . She never brought tho bond , or any effects to me . John Adams . I worked with the Prisoner till within a week of the time that the woman was murdered . Q . How long did you work with him ? Adams . I worked with him about 5 weeks , and during that time they were often quarrelling , scarcely a week passed , but they were quarrelling , two or three times in a week . Q . Did you ever observe any blows between them ? Adams . Yes , I saw him give her two , one Saturday night , and I persuaded him not to be so rash . Q . Upon what part of the body ? Adams . About the head . She persuaded me to write a letter to Mr. Walker , to let him know of the blows upon her breasts . I said , Mr. Morgan , I wonder you should abuse your wife so ; he said , he was too good for he : I believe the blackness on her breasts was occasioned by a blow ; I believe the blackness was as broad as my hand ; after this he promised to be easy . I was tired of staying they had so many quarrels ; if she could not eat ( for she was not well ) he was angry with her for that , and followed her with a hammer in his right hand , to the fore part of the shop . Q . What sort of a hammer was it ? Adams . An iron hammer , I believe the head weighed two pounds ; and he had a knife in his left hand , but I can not tell what sort of a knife it was : I do not know but it might be the knife he was eating his dinner with . He said , he had a good mind to hit her with the hammer . I went away from the house , because there were such continual debates . Daniel Franklin . I am a waterman ; on the Wednesday after the murder was committed , the Prisoner came to King 's Arms Stairs at Lambeth , and I carried him from thence to Hungerford ; he ordered me to come on shore , and said he would give me , a pint of beer , and pay me : when I came on shore , I said to the landlord at the Swan , where is the gentleman that called for a pint of beer ? and he said , the Prisoner was gone away ; and somebody said , that is the man that murdered his wife . I knew him very well . Christopher Fisher . On the Tuesday morning the Prisoner came to my shop in Rosemary Lane , and wanted to swap and get a better coat than his own ; we could not agree about the price , so he went away , but he came back again , and bought a coat of me . Alexander Cowan . About 9 o ' clock on the Monday night , my wife and the deceased were together ; I was standing in my bar , next door but one to the Prisoner 's house in Bedford Bury , said I , Mrs. Morgan , how do you do ? she said , but very indifferent : she told me , the Prisoner had taken all her linen out of the wash ; but that , he asked her first whether she would clear his bail , and she said , I will tell you another time ; that he sell a dancing and capering , and she was afraid he would kill her , I never saw her any more after that . Q . Do you know any thing of the Prisoner 's being from or at his habitation , after that time ? Cowan . I never saw him from that time , till I saw him in Oxford Castle . I have a letter from Esquire Lenthal , to let me know , that such a person was secured in the Castle . Margaret Griffith . I worked journey-work with the Prisoner five or six months . I was out of the house ten days before the murder . Q . How did they live together ? Griffith . They would oftentimes disagree in falling out . Q . Did they ever proceed to violence and blows ? Griffith . I have seen him beat her in a very unmerciful way . Q . Did he beat her with any unmerciful weapon ? Griffith . He has struck her with his fist , and said , he would stamp her guts out , and break her back , and the deceased said , she was where she should be killed ; and the deceased said twice to me , Mrs. Griffith , if my husband kills me , he will kill you . Prisoner . As to the last witness , I said , I would not have that woman at my house to live in a scandalous manner ; she used to send her child to fellows that kept my wife company . I went one day to Chelsea , and my wife said , bring me a bun ; and I said , I will my dear : and when I came home , my wife and she were drunk together . Did not my wife say , Mr. Morgan , that she would go to Hartley , and would go through the world with him , whether he would or no ? Thomas Morgan . That was several hours before what I have been speaking of ; you were talking about him , but she did not say she would keep him company then . Prisoner . I had a quarrel with my wife , but I lay all night with her ; I went out that morning about six o ' clock , and left her well , and she got up to put my stock on : I did buy a coat of that gentleman , I did not buy it of him , I bought it of another man in his shop ; then I went to King 's Arms Stairs and took water ; I used to employ that man , did not I use to employ you , Franklin ? Franklin . Yes . Prisoner . I said to this man Franklin , go and get a pot of beer , and I will pay you ; then I met one Griffin , and we went to the White Ship at Kensington , and then I went to Oxfordshire . Q . Was not you taken up there ? Prisoner . Yes , I was taken up there , and carried before a Justice , and he asked me if I was guilty , and I said I was not guilty . I said I would willingly surrender myself , and the Justice said , that if I would pay two men for a guard to look after me , he would not commit me . There was an advertisement in one of the papers after John Morgan ; and there was another advertisement after Thomas Morgan , and then I was taken up . Guilty Death . 338.

I carried him before a Justice , and he returned me the straps and a bridle with two winkers upon it , which were mine . The bridle was not mine . Q . What did Harper say when he was charged with it ? Winne . He said they were not mine , and he brought them to me , as he said , to convince me that they were not mine ; but they were mine . Q . How long had the Prisoner lived with you ? Winne . About eight months , and he never wronged me of any thing . Q . What time did you accuse Harper of taking the winkers ? Winne . When he was before the Justice . Q. I desire to know whether in all trades people have not particular fashions , and whether it is not usual for other people to imitate them ? Winne . No doubt of it . Q . Then how do you know these are yours ? [ Mr. Winne said to the Prisoner 's council ( pointing to the brass work upon the winkers ) I could answer that , but it will do you more harm than good . ] John Bishop . On the Thursday when my master went out of town , I saw Harper cut out four straps , and afterwards I saw him few the four straps together . Q . Did you say any thing to him when he was cutting out the straps , or when he was sewing them together ? Bishop . I did not say any thing to him about it . Here is a crupper and a strap which he brought to my master , ( at my master 's desire , ) to see whether they were his or not . Q . What , after he was taken up ? Bishop . No , it was before he was taken up ; and he told my master this was the breechin he sewed in that day my master was out of town , and he would pay my master for the time he was doing it . Q . When your master charged him with these , upon your information that they were his , did not he offer to bring them to him ? Bishop . Yes , but not till my master desired him . Q . Did not he say he would bring them for his master to see whether they were his ? Bishop . Yes , but not till my master desired him . Q . Did not he say he would bring them for his master to see whether they were his ? Bishop . Yes , he did . Q . Do you think he would take them with a felonious intent ? Bishop .

I asked my mistress about it , and she said she knew nothing of her going . The 5th of this month she was brought to me , and said , if I would be kind , she would help me to my watch again if she could , and owned she stole it ( but at first she denied it , and said , she knew nothing of it . ) She carried me to one Ann Atkinson , a quilter , and she confessed that she sold the watch , but did not know that it was stole . Ann Atkinson . I never saw the Prosecutor in my life . John Rock . When the Prisoner was before the Justice , she owned the taking the watch out of the Prosecutor 's room . And Ann Atkinson said that she did sell the watch for a guinea , but did not know it to be stole . Thomas Trotman . Rebecca Demain said she would help the Prosecutor to his watch again ; and Atkinson said to Demain , You vile woman , how can you charge me with a thing that I know nothing of ? A woman came in , and said , There is the watch come to light that had the glass broke . Said she , how could you say you had not the watch when you sold it for a guinea , and had four shillings for selling it ? then she fell a crying , and said , She had nailed it . Then I said , how can you deny it , when the woman says you sold it ? Then Atkinson owned she sold the watch for a guinea , and that Rebecca Demain said , when she gave it to her , that it was her father 's . Ann Atkinson . If I did say , that I sold the watch , I did not know what I said , for I never had a watch from her ; and I hope the gentlemen will forgive me for that , and take it into consideration .

[ Whipping . See summary . ] 346 , 347 . + . Edward Lloyd , and Deborah Lloyd his wife , were indicted , for that they not having the fear of God before their eyes , nor weighing the duty of their allegiance , but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil , and devising and intending our Lord the King and his people , craftily , falsely , deceitfully , feloniously and traiterously to deceive and defraud , on the 15th day of July , in the 19th year of his Majesty 's reign , at the Parish of St. Andrew 's Holborn in the county of Middlesex , twenty four pieces of false , feigned , and counterfeit money and coin , made of copper , pewter , tin , lead , and other base metals , each of the said pieces to the likeness and similitude of a good , lawful and current piece of silver money and coin of this realm , called a shilling , then and there , craftily , falsely , deceitfully , feloniously , and traiterously did make , forge , coin , and counterfeit , against the duty of their allegiance , against his Majesty 's peace , his crown , and dignity , and against the form of the statute in such case made and provided . The Counsel for the King * having opened the nature of the offence , and set forth the many ill consequences that attend this pernicious practice , they proceeded to the proof of the fact , and for that purpose called Joanna Wood : who was an accomplice with the Prisoners . * The Council for the Crown were Serjeant Hayward and Mr. Benne . Q . How long have you known the Prisoners ? Wood . About 25 or 26 years . Q . What have they followed during that time ? Wood . Nothing but what they do now ? Q . What is that ? Wood . Making money , and putting it off when they have done , and sometimes I have done the same . Deborah Lloyd and I have gone out a great many times together . Q . Have you gone out lately with her ? Wood . The last time was at that gentlewoman 's house [ Mrs. Lemmon at the Lord Cobham 's head in Cold-Bath-Fields . ] Q . What time was that ? Wood . Really I can not say rightly the day of the month ; it was eight weeks ago last Monday , that was the 15th day of July ; I have been in New Prison ever since . Q . When you went to Mrs. Lemmon 's house , who went with you ? Wood . Deborah Lloyd . Q . What did you carry with you ? Wood . I think there were seven of them . Q . Seven what ? Wood . Seven shillings . Q . Were they good or bad shillings ? Wood . They were bad shillings ? Q . Did you ever offer any of these bad shillings to Mrs. Lemmon ? Wood . I offered one of them to Mrs. Lemmon at the time I was taken ; we had been there that day once before , and Deborah Lloyd put off one ; and I did not think it proper for her to offer money twice in one day . Q . What time of the day was the first time ? Wood . I think it was about six in the evening . Q . What had you there ? Wood . A pint of ale , for she drinks nothing but ale . Q . Who did you give the shilling to ? Wood . To a young woman in the bar . Q . What change had you ? Wood . We had ten pence halfpenny . Q . So for that bad shilling , you had ten pence halfpenny , and a pint of ale . Q . How long was it after that , that you offered the other shilling ? Wood . We had only been up at Islington and returned again . And when we came to my Lord Cobham 's head , nothing would serve her , but she would go in there again . Q . What did you call for then ? Wood . A dram of rum , and that came to three half-pence , for she drinks nothing but rum and ale . Q . What did she do then ? Wood . She laid down the shilling , and the gentlewoman discovered it ; ( she was in the bar herself then ) and would not give us the change . Says Deborah Lloyd , do n't go off without the change ; if she had not said so , I believe I should have gone off ; so I was taken and carried by an officer to New Prison that night . Q . Do you know where these Shillings were made , and by whom ? Wood . Yes , to be sure I do , they were made by him [ Edward Lloyd . ] Q . How are they made ? Wood . They are made in what they call a stask . Q . What did they do with the stask ? Wood . The stask is filled with whiting . Q . Is the whiting wet or dry ? Wood . It is partly wet and partly dry . It is made into a paste , and then put into the flask . This flask opens as a book may do , and has a spout to it . Then they make a sort of an impression upon the paste with a good shilling . Q . After they have got an impression upon the paste , what do they do with the good shillings ? Wood . They shake them out : they give the flask a knock , and out drop all the good shillings . Then they make a sort of a gutter to let the liquor in ; and then they pour the metal into the flask , and when the metal is cold , they turn the bad shillings out . Q . What do they do then ? Wood . They file them to take the metal off that hangs upon the edges , to make them smooth . Q . Have you seen this done more than once ? Wood . I can not tell how often I have seen them do it ; but I have seen them do it several times . Q . Do you remember any particular day when you saw them do this ? Wood . I saw him do it upon last Whitson Monday . And about a fortnight or three weeks before I saw her do it , that was the last time I saw her do it . Q . How many were made on Whitson Monday ? Wood . There were twenty four of them made then . Q . You say you took out seven of these shillings , one of which you put off to the bar keeper , and the other Mrs. Lemmon stopped herself ; were these some of the same ? Wood . These were some of the same . Q . What did she do to them ? Wood . She scowered them . Q . So his business was to cast them , and her business was to make them fit for sale ? Wood . That was just as they agreed . Q . Were they boiled in any thing ? Wood . Yes . Q . What were they boiled in ? Wood . They were boiled in allom water . Q. I suppose you used to make some of them ? Wood . I never did any thing , but only assisted in putting them off . Q . What did you do afterwards ? Wood . When I was in New-Prison I desired them to make every thing safe , and they came and told me every thing was safe . Q . What did they do with the materials ? Wood . They used to put them into a close stool , or any other private place . Q . Did they use to put them into a chair ? Wood . Yes , this is the chair they used to put them into . [ There was a two armed chair produced with a false bottom , that let down like a flap . ] On Wednesday night when I saw Mr. North , I thought it better than to lie in goal , to make a confession . Q . Did you say any thing to Mr. North where the things were ? Wood . I told him they were in a chair with a false bottom ; and that there were some drawers with oil and other things . Q. Pray what other account did you give to Mr. North ? Wood . Sir , I could give no other account . Q . Was that money that you put off made by the man and the woman [ the two Prisoners ? ] Wood . Yes , the same . Prisoner , Edward Lloyd . I have not heard a word she says , and I am very deaf . Did you ever see me make any of this money ? Oh , you strumpet ! Did not your brother use to make them ? Court . She says , That on Whitson Monday she saw you coin 24 shillings . Prisoner , Deb . Lloyd . She says , she saw me coin some too . These poor hands are not fit for coining . You know how to make them . Counsel . She does so . Deb . Lloyd . Did not you lie with my husband all night ? Speaking to her husband , she said , Did not you take her home , and was not she seen in bed with you ? Prisoner , Edward Lloyd . I would ask you whether when you came from South Carolina , you did not make an information to one Mr. Pinkney , and was an evidence against Morgan ? Wood . No , I did not . Edw Lloyd . What , do you deny it ? Oh you strumpet ! Brooks . ( constable ) About seven weeks ago Mrs. Lemmon sent for me to take charge of a person for putting off bad money . Q . Who did she charge you with ? Brooks . With Joanna Wood . This is the shilling that Mrs. Lemmon gave me . Prisoner , Deb . Lloyd . Pray , Madam , did I ever give you a shilling ? Jury . She does not say you did . Q. to Mrs. Lemmon . Do you remember one or both of these women coming to your house ? Mrs. Lemmon . Yes , very well , I remember both of them ; Deb . Lloyd , and the evidence Wood , came to my house , and had a three half-penny glass of rum . Q . Who drank the rum ? Lemmon . Deb . Lloyd . Q . Who offered you the shilling ? Lemmon . Joanna Wood offered me the shilling . Q . Did you take this shilling of her ? Lemmon . I threw the shilling down upon the bar , but I did not like the sound of it . So I kept it and stopped her . Q . Are you sure this is the shill ing she gave you ? Lemmon . I verily believe it is ; I can not swear positively to it ; for I gave it several gentlemen there that looked at it , and then I gave it to the constable . It is the shilling I gave the constable ; and that very night I found three bad shillings that the young woman at the bar had taken that day . Prisoner , Deb . Lloyd . I never saw the gentlewoman in my life before , so I do n't know how I can ask her any questions . Lemmon . When I complained that it was a bad shilling , the Prisoner Deb . Lloyd run away . Mr. John North , Sollicitor to the mint . Upon Joanna Wood 's being taken up , Justice Poulson sent me a letter , upon which I waited on him : When I came there , I saw Mrs. Wood , who I have known a great while , on account of her putting off counterfeit money . As I have known the Prisoners at the bar several years on the same account , I have often desired them to make a discovery of their accomplices , but they never would . Joanna Wood desired to go into another room to talk with me , and she said she was tired of that way of life , that she had been frequently in trouble about it , and was resolved to make a discovery of the affair . Then she said that Mr. Lloyd and Mrs. Lloyd , the Prisoners at the bar , for she [ Mrs. Lloyd ] went many years by the name of Moody , both of them coined ; and that if I went to their lodging at a barber 's shop in Purpool Lane , I should certainly meet with them , and I went there accordingly . Deb . Lloyd . And what did you find there ? North . I went there the next day , but Mrs. Wood said she believed I should not find any thing , for she had given them a caution to put them out of the way . But she said if I found any thing it would be in a chair with a false bottom . I went there with two men , one of which was a constable : It was some time before I found out the chair with the false bottom ; but at last I found that this false bottom let down with a sort of a hinge ; but there was nothing to be found there . I searched the other parts of the room , and found nothing ; but in some private drawers there were several little parcels of tape , sealing wax , and divers other sorts of goods ; but I did not see any thing relating to what they were charged with . And Deborah Lloyd said you may look as long as you will , there are no forty pounds to be found here . Then I went to Justice Poulson 's , and Deborah fell in a passion , and said to the evidence Wood , What ! have you served me so ? you have got the start of me now . And Deborah asked me whether Wood had informed against her son and daughter for making of money ; I said , no ; then , she said , I will . She said to me , Mr. North , you have often desired me to make a discovery of the persons-concerned with me in coining , which I have always refused to do . When she said the evidence had got the start of her , why , said I , has she got the start of you , did you ever see Mrs. Wood make money ? Yes , said she , I have . Court . Did you ever see Wood make money ? Deb . Lloyd . Yes , I have . Q . Did you ask her any questions with respect to the metal they made this money of ? North . Yes , she said that Edward Lloyd told her where he used to buy it . I went to the shop to make an enquiry into the affair ; but the person who used to serve him is here himself , and can give your Lordship an account of what he knows of the matter . Deborah Lloyd . All the questions I would ask Mr. North is , ( for he said I slew in a passion , and asked whether Joanna Wood had put her son and daughter into the information , for they have coined money , and she learned them to do it ) whether I did not bid him go to the evidence 's son in law 's , and make a search ? I told you if you searched there , you would find something , did not I ? North . Yes , you did so . Thomas Foot , constable . I was desired by Mr. North to go to the Prisoner 's house to take them up . I saw this chair there , and there was a great quantity of little parcels of things . And here is a file , two marking irons , and a spoon . Lloyd . These marking irons are to mark the spoons with . [ The gentleman 's servant of whom the metal was bought proved that the Prisoner Edward Lloyd used to buy more or less once a months for eleven years together . ] Edward Lloyd ( to the last witness . ) Do you know me ? The witness . Yes , very well . Lloyd . What are you , master or servant ? Witness . I am a servant . Lloyd . What have you known me eleven years , and say I have bought metal of you for that time ? I never bought any such thing in my life . Prisoner Edward Lloyd . Here is but one single witness against us , ( and the laws of England require two ) and that is Joanna Wood , and she is no witness at all , for the laws of England say , that no single person shall be an evidence against another , unless their character be as clear as the sun ; and she is as dark as ever she can be ; she is as spotted as ever she can be ; a rainy night can not be darker . No person , especially one so dark as she , ought to be admitted to take another person 's life away . There was nothing found in my room relating to coining . And as for the chair I gave 14 d. for it in Moorfields , as it is , Gentlemen , I hope that as there is but one single evidence against us , and one so black as she is , that you will have no regard to her . When you went to your son and daughter 's , how could you get money to support yourself without putting off the money ? do n't saint now , but speak the truth ; what day was it you ever saw me do such a thing , as you have been now speaking of , though I can hardly hear you ? Wood . It was on Whitson Monday . Deborah Lloyd . I am not fit for a coiner , one that has no fingers . For six weeks together she lay almost every night , all night long with my husband ; and she wanted him to marry her . Edward Lloyd . She did frequently ask me to marry her , but I said I could not do that , for I had a wife already . She said , what signifies that , it is only burning in the hand . Lloyd , ( to Winifred Ward , one of the Prisoners . ) Did not you hear Wood say , she would swear hard against me ? Ward . I never heard her say any thing , but that she was sorry for the old people , and was afraid it would go hard with them . Guilty Death . 348.

Mrs. Dingey 's shift was found upon the Prisoner , wrapped round her body ; I nursed Mrs. Dingey in her lying-in , and this is her shift . The Constable deposed , That when the blind man brought the Prisoner to his house , he charged her with stealing the shift ; she said , she had not had one on for a week , and pulled her gown on one side , to shew that she had never a one on ; that he said , what do you design to do with her ? the blind man said , he would charge her with robbing him ; and when she was before the Justice , he turned her apron aside , and there was the shift .

There came one Fennel into the house , whose wife keeps a broker 's shop , and hearing we had lost a tea-kettle , he said , such a tea-kettle was offered to his wife the night before to be sold , with about a pint and a half of boiling water in it . The Prisoner came into the house some time afterwards , and I asked her , if she wanted to steal another tea-kettel ; she said , she never was in my house before , and used me with ill words , though I used her with very good words ; I said , I would send to the woman that she offered it to ; and if she did not say , she brought the kettle to her , she should go about her business : I sent for Mrs. Fennell , and she said , she was the person ; then she begged and cried and desired to be excused ; and said , she had sold it for 2 s. 3 d. at a Brazier 's shop , but could not tell where , for she had not been in town above three weeks .

On the 30th of May the Prisoner delivered that bill into my hand . When he delivered the bill to me , I said , Mr. Scruton , this bill is not due . He said it is a customary thing among us to oblige one another to pay a bill before it is due , if we want cash . He said he received it from a friend , and that his friend was going out of town . I knew it was a customary thing , and then I looked to see if it was regularly endorsed . I found it was not endorsed by his friend , so I desired he would order his friend to endorse it ; he said his friend was gone to the tavern to drink a glass of wine , and he would endorse it for him ; so I said he might witness the bill for him .

Do you know who you paid it to ? Burchall . No , I do not . Q . Then you do n't know who you paid it to ? Burchall . I do n't know who I paid it to . Q .

Collyer . I did so . Q . What time was that ? Collyer . I ca n't tell exactly , but I believe it was between the 15th and 20th of June last ; I was informed by one of my brother officers that there was a suspicion of indirect practices in the Prisoner , and I found 20 l. missing in a person 's account . I told him of it , and said it was his business to place it to account , or he would suffer by it ; he said he had a friend who was out of town , but he would be in town in two or three days , and then he would replace it , but that person never came . Q . What did he say in excuse of himself ? Collyer . He said he had made a mistake in that bill . Q . Did not he say that his friend was out of town , and would be in town in two or three days , and when he came to town he would bring the money and place it to the proper account ? Collyer . He did so . Q . He might have gone off , could not he ? Collyer . He might have gone off indeed . Q . Could not he have gone off with two thousand pounds of the Bank 's , if he would ? Collyer . No . Q . Could not he have gone off with a thousand pounds ? Collyer . I believe not . Q . Could he have gone off with five hundred ? Collyer . I believe he might have gone off with five hundred pounds . Q . Do you think , if he had had a mind he might have wronged the Bank of more ? Collyer . Yes , to be sure , in that time he might have had an opportunity of doing more mischief . Q . Did he ever tender the money to you ? Collyer . No . Q . Should you have received the money of him before this transaction ? Collyer . Yes , to be sure I should , not knowing of any fraud . Q . What security did he give ? Collyer . He gave a thousand pounds security . Q . As you are an officer of the Bank , would you have compounded this fraud ? Collyer . No , indeed I would not . Q . Then you did not take it to be a fraud ? Collyer . No indeed , I did not . Q . Did not you think he was an honest man ? Collyer . I always look upon a man to be honest , till he proves a rogue . Q. I would ask you , whether a person may not take out a bill , and make use of it upon occasion ? Collyer . No , Sir , I have not known it done these 36 years . Q . If a man of substance was to make use of a note of 20 l. should you take him to be a felon ? Collyer . That I must leave to the Directors of the Bank . Q . Before this thing , did you think he would have committed a felony ? Collyer . I can not tell what to say to that , for it is impossible to find a man guilty of a thing , 'till the fact is proved upon him . Q . Should you reckon that a person who makes a mistake ought to be deemed a felon ? Collyer . I can not see how that can well be . Q. to Sawbridge . Will you tell us how you came to find out , that you had not credit given you for it by the Bank . Sawbridge . I had credit given me for it by the Bank . Q. to Collyer . How long was it before you found it out that the note was missing ? Collyer . It was full a fortnight after he had received the money . Q . Did the Prisoner deny that he had the twenty pounds ? Collyer . No , he said he had it , and that he would make it good . [ Mr. Collyer said , the Prisoner had a good character before this . ] The Council on each side having gone through the examination of the witnesses , the Council for the Prisoner insisted on a point of law , relating to the meaning and construction of the word imbezzle , and that the Prisoner did not come within the intent and meaning of the act of parliament ; which being fully argued on each side , it was the opinion of the Court that the Prisoner was within the intent and meaning of the said act .
