Charles Shippey . I work next door to the place where this robbery was committed , I am a cooper , at the Hoop and Adze , I happened to go out to the door between eight and nine in the evening , and the Prisoners were at Mrs. Johnson 's window and about the door . Q . What did you see them do ? Shippey . I will tell you if you please to give me leave . I had no suspicion when I first saw them at all , and I suppose they thought that I should tout them , or hinder them in their design ; says he in the blue coat , [ Burroughs ] Jack , shall we have a pint of beer , or can we have a dream of gin ; I made a particular remark of all three of them for then I thought what they were ; they went into an alehouse , the Hoop and Adze , and called for a quartern of gin - I looked at the clock , and it was then between eight and nine . Burroughs had his hat flapping over his eyes , that I should not see his face , for I looked very hard at them , and after they had drank their gin , Burroughs gave the accomplice ( Thorne ) three half-pence to pay for it ; when Appleby had got the gin in his mouth he held down his head to spit it out , and the other stooped , and was complaining of his shoes being worn out ; and standing pretty near the fire , somebody asked him what made him so cold ? He said , If you went as near the ground as I , you would be cold too . After they were gone out of the house , I said , these three fellows look as if they would break their necks in going to Paddington . Mrs. Spriggs , the woman of the house , said she believed they had a mind to rob somebody ; said I , I believed they are going to rob Mrs. Johnson . Mrs. Spriggs went out to look , and came in again , and said my heart is ready to burst , there is one of them against Mrs. Johnson 's window now , and another on the other side of the way ; and presently Mrs. Johnson cried out , I am robbed . I run out in a hurry and saw the accomplice , I seized him directly , and said , d - n you I know you , and I 'll keep you . Q . How did you know him ? Shippey . I knew him by the sear in his face - I did not see any of them run away , but I was very quick in catching of him ; I carried him , back to the Hoop and Adze , and asked him if he was not ashamed to rob people who work hard for their living ? He said he did not come to rob any body ; he said that he was going to Smithfield , and came in to drink with the Prisoners , but never saw them before in his life . We secured him , and the next morning had him before a Justice , and hearing of Long Charles , as they call him , his name is Charles Reddington , and as he is a thief-taker , and conversant with such sort of people , we acquainted him with the affair , and asked him if he did not know any thing of them , and so they were apprehended .

Prisoner . When Clay was before the Justice , he said I was not with him when the robbery was committed . Clay . I did not say any such thing . Prisoner . You do this to save your own life and take away mine , pray my Lord enquire into his character . Clay .

Simon Bailey . [ He was tried with Mary Wilson . ] The next day after this robbery was committed , Dick Clay told me that he and Jack Paine committed this robbery , and that there was no body else with them .

Not long - I have known him by seeing him in England about three years ago - in Duke 's Place . Q . What is the Prisoner 's business . Lyon .

Q . Did not you visit him when he was sick ? Lyon . I never visited him there , Mr. Simpson told me he paid him . Q . Was not you in town on Lord Mayor 's day ? Lyon . I was not in town then . Q .

Q . Who was this sick person ? Isaac Joseph . Joseph McCoy , the Prisoner . Q . You are certain to the time , are not you ? Isaac Joseph . Yes , to the best of my knowledge it was the time .

Did you see the Prisoner there ? Jacob Moses . No , I do not speak as to the Prisoner ; I came from thence to Holland to stock myself with a little rum , because we keep a coffee-house at Brussels . Q . What do you know of the Prisoner ? Jacob Moses . I was with Abraham Lyon the 9th or 10th of October , in Holland ; I said who is here else ? he told me this Prisoner at the Bar ; I desired to know whether he went to England , for my desire was to send a letter to my wife ; and I gave a letter to him in their quarters . Jury . Do you know when your wife received the letter . Jacob Moses . I know nothing of that , I know no more ; I went directly to Brussels - I gave him my letter the 10th or 11th of Oct. - I can not tell whether it was on a Tuesday or Wednesday - we went by the stile of the English . Isaac Navarro . I was a Prisoner at the Poultry Compter for debt , and Richard Clay came in a Prisoner there , along with Abraham Pass , who was hanged about two sessions ago - Clay was brought in for robbing .

When did you find it ? Clavey . I found it the 29th of December . Q . How do you know it to be your 's ? Clavey . I know it by my mark , 't is marked in three places that I can swear to . Q . How came you to find it out ? Clavey . I had an information from a person that the Prisoner at the bar was an accomplice with a servant of mine , who is indicted for the like offence , and suspected that he had pawned some of my goods : upon this information I desired my apprentice to go to Mr. Price 's and enquire whether there was any such thing pawned to him ; this Gentleman came to me very handsomly the next morning , and told me that he had such a thing , and the Prisoner was taken up directly ; as to his character it is very notorious . Prisoner . Please to give him his oath whether I ever pawned any thing to that gentleman . Liscomb Price . On or about the 29th of last month , Mr. Clavey sent his servant to me to enquire if I knew one Thomas Parker , and whether he had at any time pawned any linen at our house . I had some company at my house then , it being in the Christmas week , so I sent my servant to acquaint him that I would let him know in the morning . I examined , and found that there was a parcel entered in my book in the name of Parker ; a coat and a remnant of linen , which the Prisoner pledged in the month of September last ; I went to him the next morning and told him there was a little remnant of a coarse piece of Irish linen , and that I apprehended it to be the fag end , and thought by that he might satisfy himself whether it was his , and desired him to come to our house to see it ; he came to our house , looked upon , and saw some marks by which he knew it . Q . Who pledged that to you ? Price . This was pledged at our house by the Prisoner , he delivered it to me himself . Q . Did you know him before ? Price . I have known the man some time , he bought a watch of me within these twelve months and paid for it . Prisoner . I own I pawned the things about five months ago : Mr. Clavey 's servant came to me with a coat and a piece of cloth , and he said Mr. Clavey gave him the coat ; he said he was going out of town and wanted a little money , and if I could get him half a guinea upon them it would be of some service to him . I told him I would try , and I carried them to Mr. Price 's , as I had pawned some things of my own there before , and I pawned them for him to this gentleman , and gave him the half guinea . Clavey . There 's another material witness , but we think he is sent out of the way . Q. to Mr. Clavey . Have you seen the Prisoner frequently about your shop ? Clavey , Yes , he has been in the shop frequently , and I believe oftner than I knew of . Prisoner . I have no other witness but Mr. Clavey 's man William Randall , he can clear me of this . [ The Prisoner was informed , that he might choose whether he would be sworn or not , because he was not obliged to answer any questions that might tend to accuse himself ; he paused some time , and then consented to be sworn . ] William Randall . I took up nine pounds worth of goods of my master , I have a bill of parcels of them here ; this is part of them . Clavey . He had some goods of me , but this is no part of them . I can prove when this piece of goods came into the house . Randall . I bought it of my master , and desired the Prisoner to pawn it for me . [ The bill of parcels was produced . ] This is the piece , it is charged to me the 21st of June . Q . How long is it ago since you bought that of Mr. Clavey ? Randall . I believe it was about seven months ago . Q . Who did you buy it of ? Randall . I bought it of Mr. Hodgkins the youngest apprentice but one , and my master said he could afford to sell this at 1 s. 9 d. a yard , and he charged me two shillings for it . Acquitted . 120. William Randall , was indicted for stealing 8 yards of Irish linen , value 20 s. the goods of Charles Clavey , December 21st . Charles Clavey . About the 20th of December last , I had occasion to look out ten yards of Irish linen for a customer , and I first went to the cut pile as we call it , to see if there was any thing there that would do . I looked out this remnant , and thought it was about 10 yards , and that it would do ; when I came to measure it was but eight yards three quarters , and finding the quantity not sufficient , I put it again into the pile : the next morning I looked out a whole piece of cloth , and had a mind to compare it with the remnant I had looked upon the day before , and when I came to look for it it was gone ; ( I had rebuked my man for carelessness in not puting it into a paper the day before ) this being pretty early in the morning , I thought no shoplifter could have got it by any stratagem , and then my suspicion rested upon somebody in the house . I made an enquiry among the Gentlemen in the shop whether any of them had mislaid it , and they said no ; then said I , this piece of cloth is absolutely stole , and I will be satisfied what is become of it ; the middle apprentice said , Sir , do n't be impatient about it , I may find it by and by : we went into the cellar to see if it was there , for my suspicion rested upon the Prisoner , and upon a thorough search we found it under some coolers , or brewing vessels . I took no notice that I had found it , but enquired after it in the family ( for I was not fully satisfied that he was the thief though it was there ) and in order to find it out I planted my apprentice at night in the dark to have an eye upon him , for if he came with a candle he could see what he did , and I desired a friend of mine to stay with me : the piece was rolled up when he took it , and when it was found it was tied up in a square form . The Prisoner went down into the cellar and moved it from the place where it was ; my apprentice was coming up to tell me , and I believe his shoes might crack ; says he , he has moved it , and I believe he has seen me ; I said I must not let him go out of the shop with it , for if he does he will run away . Said I , do you go and get a Constable , and in the mean time Mr. Jupe and I will try if we can get him to confess ; we went into the cellar and he had his soul linen about him : said I , what do you do with all this linen , I have a great suspicion that you are a rogue , do n't you know that I have been making an enquiry after a piece of linen that is lost out of the shop to day ? Do you know nothing of it ? He said no , he knew nothing of it . Said I , did not you hide it in this part of the cellar , and take it out from the place where you hid it ? He said , no ; said I , I think you are a fellow of the most consummate impudence to deny this , for Ralph has seen you do it . My friend interposed and said , friend , I am very sorry for you , I wish you would confess the thing and see if your master will forgive you : I said , Will , if you do not now produce it I will make a thorough search ; and if I find it I will send you to Newgate . By that time the Constable came , and then he began to whimper , and he put his hand into a prickle of straw , pulled it out and gave it to me in this flat form it is now . - It was not near the coolers then , it was in another part of the cellar . - I suspected him the more , because he had been a little tardy before : when I told him he must go to Newgate , he begged very hard that he might not be sent there , and said it was the first time he had ever wronged me or injured me in his life . I told him he must go there , and then I bid him pull off his clothes and put on his old frock . Q . What were the words he said to you when he delivered the bundle to you ? Clavey . He said it was the first time that ever he had injured me or robbed me in his life . Q . Are you sure he made use of the word rob ? Clavey . Yes , I can safely say he made use of the word rob . - Jupe . On the 21st of December about six in the evening , I went to Mr. Clavey 's ( I had some business with him ) and he desired me to go into the compting-house ; he said he was about making a discovery of a robbery and desired me to stay ; I heard him give directions to his servant to conceal himself and watch the Prisoner ; some time afterwards the apprentice came and said , I saw him take it out from under the tubs or coolers , and I saw him take some clothes from under them ; says he , I believe he is gone to some other part of the cellar , and has conveyed it away , and the reason he gave his master was , because he brought the candle to the lettice to see if he could see any body . Then Mr. Clavey sent his servant for a constable , and desired me to go down into the cellar with him ; the Prisoner was in the cellar , and stood as if he was rolling up some soul linen . Mr. Clavey asked him what he was doing of ; he said he was looking up his shirts or linen . Said he , I believe you are a rogue , what is become of the linen that was under the tubs or coolers , I ca n't tell whether he said tubs or coolers ; the Prisoner said he knew nothing of it ; said Mr. Clavey , we know you have removed it within these five minutes ; a little while afterwards somebody knocked at the door , and Mr. Clavey said I will send you to Newgate as sure as you are alive if you do n't give it me ; upon that he went to a prickle or a basket of straw , and took it out in such a shape as it is now , and gave it to him ; then he charged the Constable with him and ordered him to pull off his livery , and when he had done that , he cried and said he hoped his master would forgive him , for he had never wronged him before in his life . Q . This time that you speak of , was this the time that Mr. Clavey mentions . - Jupe . The very same time . Ralph Hodgkins . I am an apprentice to Mr. Clavey , on the 21st of December in the morning , he looked into the Irish pile , and said there was a remnant of Irish gone , and asked me if I knew any thing of it ; I told him no , but I would look in the shop and endeavour to find it , but I could not ; by my master 's orders I watched the Prisoner , and about 12 o'clock , or between 12 and one , I saw him put it between two coolers or under the coolers in the cellar ; about five o'clock in the afternoon , I went down to look if it was there , and I found it had been removed , in the evening I went by Mr. Clavey 's order to watch in the cellar , and in a little time the Prisoner came down with a box of knives to clean ; after he had cleaned 3 or 4 of them he went to the coolers and lifted one of them up , and took out a piece of linen ( it was half in the paper and half out ) and carried it to another part of the cellar . - It was then in a long form , I think he tied it up in this square form ; then he went up stairs and came down in about 3 or 4 minutes . I went afterwards and stood upon another pair of stairs that went into the shop , and he put the candle through the lettice of the stairs where I was , and I believe he saw me , but he did not say any thing to me nor I to him . I went to Mr. Clavey to let him know what I had seen , and he ordered me to go for a Constable , and when I came back he fell down on his knees and begged Mr. Clavey to forgive him , and said , it was the first thing that ever he did in his life . Q . What were the words he spoke then ? Hodgkins . I can not remember the words , but he desired Mr. Clavey to forgive him . Prisoner . I would ask the Prosecutor whether I have not lived with him two or three years , and have been entrusted with money from one part of the town to another ? Clavey . It is true he has lived with me about two years , but I never entrusted him with money unless it was to go to market , and when the porter has been out of the way , I have sent him with a little parcel . Prisoner . I would ask him whether he has not trusted me with his portmanteau and his money ? Clavey . That was when I was travelling the country and he went as my servant . Perhaps there might be 4 or 500 l. in the portmanteau , but then I was with him , and I do n't apprehend that to be trusting him with the money . John Greenly . I am a sadler , and the Prisoner is a sadler by trade , I have known him three years last July , he was my servant about 7 months , he behaved himself honestly and justly to me , I never suspected him of any wrong , and he had opportunities of wronging me if he would .

The Commission of Bankruptcy against William Bedell , and the depositions under the said commission , were duly proved , and the said Moravia 's deposition was read , but William Bedell not having obtained his certificate , a general release from the said Bedell to the commissioners , and the assignees was produced and proved ; then Bedell having no interest in the estate under the commission , was admitted to give evidence . Council for the Prosecutor . Mr. Bedell , did you ever buy any hemp of Mr. Salem Owen ? William Bedell . About the 6th of December , 1742 , I bought about 12 tons of hemp of him - to the best of my knowledge it might be to the value of about 330 l. - there was an attachment in the Mayor 's Court , about the 10th or 11th of Dec. Q . Did any body offer themselves to be bail ? Bedell . One Moses Moravia was recommended to me by Mr. Satchel , about the 11th of Dec. - I do n't know that I ever saw Moravia 's face before that time in my life . Q . Was he willing and ready to be bail ? Bedell . He was very willing ; at the instigation of Mr. Satchel , Mr. Moravia went to be bail - about the 17th or 18th of Dec. and was rejected . Q . Could you get any other bail ? Bedell . I could not . Q . When did Mr. Moravia apply to you to buy this parcel of hemp ? Bedell . I think it was the afternoon before Christmas-day , he said he would give me 200 l. for the hemp , and laid down a moidore , but we did not make any agreement then ; we met again the 3 d of January at Peele 's Coffee-house in Fleet-street , I did not go to meet Mr. Moravia , I went to meet Mr. Robinson , but Mr. Moravia and I finished the agreement then . Q . Is not Mr. Robinson Mr . Moravia 's sollicitor ? Bedell . I believe he is . Q . What did you sell the hemp for ? Bedell . I sold it to the best of my knowledge for a note of 105 l. - payable in 8 days , and a note for 100 lb . weight of India rhubarb , to be delivered upon demand - the major part of the hemp lay at Warner 's warehouses in Mincing-lane , they are kept by one Clark , the rest lay at the White-horse in Purpool-lane ; that part I sold him lay at Warner 's warehouses . Q . What bill of parcels did you produce at that time ? Bedell . To the best of my knowledge I delivered a bill of parcels given me by Mr. Owen with his receipt at the bottom of it , we had been drinking of rack punch pretty plentifully , that I can not very well tell . Q . Did you deliver Mr. Moravia any bill of parcels ? Bedell . Yes , I delivered a bill of parcels of Mr. Owen 's . Q . Was it possible for you to make a bill of parcels then ? Bedell . It was not possible for me to make a bill of parcels then , because I could not tell the weight of the hemp . - We went away about 11 o'clock . Q . Where did you go then ? Bedell . I went directly home to Grays-Inn-Lane . - I staid there the whole night . Q . Did you go to Houndsditch that night ? Bedell . To the best of my knowledge I have not been in Hounsditch these three years . Q . Did you see Mr. Moravia that night after you parted at Peele 's Coffee-house ? Bedell . I saw him no more that night . Q . How long was it before you saw him again ? Bedell . The note was made payable in 8 Days , I saw him before the 8 days were out in order to remind him of it , as I wanted money . - I never had a farthing of him , for he said he could not well pay me till he got the hemp . Q . Did you ever borrow any notes of him ? Bedell . I never borrowed one note of him . Q . When was you arrested ? Bedell . I was arrested the 18th of January . Q . What day was you carried to the Fleet ? Bedell . I believe it was about the 22d . Q . What was the first time Mr. Moravia came to you ? Bedell . The 22d was on a Saturday , and then I went to the Fleet , and he came to me the Sunday following - I think it was the 22d of January , I can not be positive to a day . Q . When had you notice of the commission being taken out ? Bedell . I think the commission was sealed the 24th , and I had notice of it the 27th . Q . When was Mr. Moravia so kind as to come to see you again ? Bedell . I believe it was on Friday the 28th , he might come after my goods , and the notes and every thing I had was seized on . Q . Where were the two notes then , the note of 105 l. and the note to deliver the 100 lb . weight of rhubarb ? Bedell . I think they were at my lodging in Gray's-Inn-Lane . Q . What was the occasion of Moravia 's waiting on you then ? Bedell . He said he understood there was a commission out against me , and that all my effects were seized ; he said , be of good heart , and I will take your part , for I believe the commission will not stand , and if you will take my advice , I will allow you 2 guineas a week , and put a 1000 guineas in your pocket - he said , he thought it was not a good commission . Q . How much money did he say he would put in your pocket ? Bedell . I can not tell justly , it was a large sum , I am sure it was 500 l. and he laid down a great deal of gold upon the table ; Mr. Ravenscroft , Mr. Robinson 's clerk came , and we went into Mr. Helbutt 's room , and he took some instructions for an answer in Chancery , but very short ; he went away , and came again about four o'clock ; Moravia said , he had a summons left him to attend the Commissioners at the Crown-Tavern on Ludgate-Hill , but he could not tell what they wanted with him ; there was one Mrs. Burrell a relation of Mr. Helbutt 's there , and he desired her to go out of the room ; and he wanted me to enter into an agreement with him , and desired me to write down ( I think it was ) January 3 , 1742 . Borrowed and received of Mr. Moses Moravia , a note of hand for 105 l. - payable 8 ( or it might be 12 ) days after date , which I promise to return in 8 ( or 12 ) days from the date hereof , and as a collateral security , I promise to leave 100 lb . weight of rhubarb in his hands , till the note is delivered up again . Witness my hand , William Bedell ; but I can not justly say the words : I took a sheet of paper and wrote to this effect , and delivered it to Mr. Moravia . Q . What did he say when he desired you to do this ? Did he give you any reason for it ? Bedell . He said as he was to serve me he expected me to serve him . Q . What did he mean by that ? Bedell . I can not tell what he meant by it . Q . How came you to do that ? Bedell . I was like a bird in a cage , and wanted to get my liberty - he would not suffer any body to be by then , he said he was going to the Commissioners ; on Sunday morning he came again and said , he had been 7 or 8 hours before the Commissioners , that they had harassed him very much , and that he was obliged to sign the deposition . Q . Did he tell you what the contents of that deposition were ? Bedell . He said , if I did not keep up to the contents of that deposition , he and his family would be ruined ; and if I did it would be a great deal in my way . Q . Did he tell you what that deposition was ? Bedell . Yes he did ; and I put it into writing , for fear I should forget it . Q . Whose room were you in then ? Bedell . In Sir John Witteronge 's room ; he desired Mr. Ravenscroft to withdraw then , and Sir John Witteronge withdrew as he was a gentleman . Then he repeated it again , that if I did not keep up to his deposition he was undone . [ The paper produced . ] This is my own hand-writing , I wrote it the 30th of January , 1742 , in order to remind me of what Mr. Moravia had sworn ; and he made me give him a note of hand for 100 l. payable 8 days after date . [ Bedell reads . ] Monday the 3d of January , 1742 , the contract was made at Peele 's Coffee-house about seven o'clock , and about ten or eleven I was at Moses Moravia 's house in Gravel-lane , over-against the workhouse , Houndsditch ; and I desired him to lend me 50 or 60 l. on the rhubarb . Mr. Moravia answered me , he could not spare the cash , because he wanted to pay away himself ; but he offered to lend me his note on the rhubarb ; accordingly he did for 100 l. for which I gave him my counter note , and left the rhubarb in his hands for security till I returned the note . And that the rhubarb was in the back yard . Q . Did he produce any note then ? Bedell . He produced I think a note of his hand of 100 l. payable from him to me , I believe it was dated the 3d of January last - it was to pay to me 100 l. or 105 l. - and he made me give him a receipt for 50 l. in cash , and 50 lb . weight of rhubarb , dated the 6th of January , to balance that note , and I did not receive a farthing , he gave me then a note to deliver 50 lb . weight of rhubarb on demand , dated the 6th of January , though it was the 30th. `` I promise to deliver to Mr. William Bedell on `` demand , 50 lb . weight of India rhubarb . Jan. 6 . 1742. `` Moses Moravia . '' Q . How was this to be managed between you ? Bedell . I did every thing he desired me to do , because he was to give me two guineas a week Q . What did he say to induce you to do this ? Bedell . He said he would sacrifice his wife and family for me , if I would keep up to the text , and if I did not we should both be ruined . Council for the Prisoner on the cross examination . You omitted something , you said you gave Moravia no other bill of parcels than what you had of Mr. Owen . Bedell . I think so . Q . Do you know Abraham Judah . Bedell . Yes - I believe he was several times with Mr. Moravia and me - I ca n't tell what he said . The Prisoner 's Council produced some papers which they said were a bill of parcels , and orders to the warehouse-keepers to deliver the hemp . Q . Were you in liquor then ? Bedell . I was to be sure intoxicated then . Q . How long had you been in company ? Bedell . I came into company about 7 o'clock , and parted about 11 . Q . Were these things signed the 1st part of the evening or the latter ? Bedell I believe they were signed about the middle of the time that we were in company - after we had been there about two hours . Q . What was Mr. Robinson then , was not he your attorney ? Bedell . He had been my attorney : I believe he was every body 's attorney . Q . You have taken upon you to say that you never was at Mr. Moravia 's , is that true ? Bedell . I was not there during my whole life . There being no evidence offered on the behalf of the prosecution but Bedell 's the bankrupt ; Sir John Witterange and Isaac Helbutt , who had made depositions before the Commissioners in the commission against Bedell , were proved dead since the commencement of the prosecution ; and the copies of their depositions enrolled in Chancery , and examined , were offered as evidence , but were not ( after long debate ) admitted by the Court to be read as evidence ; so that there was only Bedell 's oath against Moravia 's , which by the opinion of the Court was not sufficient in law to convict him of perjury , and he was thereupon acquitted . 139. Giles Brown , was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury , upon an affidavit made in the Court of King's-Bench , but the Prosecutor not producing a copy of the writ which was founded on the said affidavit , the Jury were directed to acquit the Prisoner . Elizabeth Nicholls , was arraigned upon an indictment for subornation of perjury , and ordered to prepare for her trial next session , without farther notice . The Trials being ended , the Court proceeded to give Judgment as follows . Received Sentence of Death , 3. John Burton 109 Henry Burroughs 110 Joseph Isaacs 116 Transportation for 14 Years , 1.
