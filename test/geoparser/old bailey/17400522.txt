On the 6th of this Month , this Spoon was found upon the Prisoner ; 't is my Property , and- 't was missing about 6 o'Clock in the Evening . I am a Drawer at Sadler's-Wells , and have belong 'd to that Place these 7 Years . My Wife sent for me from thence , to my Lodging , that Evening , and I found the Prisoner in my Room ; she was charged by my Wife , with having taken the Spoon , and I called the next Witness ( Harry Hales ) into the Room , and he found is upon her , because I had so much Modestly , I could not put my Hands where he did ; I was in the Room at the same Time , and am sure the Spoon which he took from the Prisoner was my Property : For it was my first Child 's Spoon , and there 's my Name , and my Father 's and Mother 's Name upon it . Hen . Hales . Josias Brain called me up Stairs at that time , and told me his Wife suspected the Prisoner had taken a Spoon . I put one Hand down her Bosom , and the other Hand up her Petticoats , and took the Spoon from under her Petticoat- Strings , between her Skin and her Smock , and the Tightness of her Petticoat-Strings had bent it . This is the same Spoon I took from her , and which Brian own 'd to be his . She deny 'd the Fact , till I found it upon her ; then she said she was sorry for it , and when she was before the Justice , she begg 'd for Mercy . Rose Brian . I am the Wife of the first Witness . The Prisoner on the 6th of May sent to desire me to come to her , and she would inform me that I might have a Child to nurse , of one Mr Foster in the Temple . But I had some Milk then boiling on the Fire , so I desired her to come to me for an Answer . She accordingly came , and while she was in the Room , I missed the Spoon from a little Stand at the End of the Chimney : I was sure I laid it there while the Milk was boiling , and therefore I taxed her with taking it . She denied it , and said she would make me suffer for challenging her upon such an Account , and told me I had only mislaid it : But I sent for my Husband , and the Prisoner was taken by him and Hales , into another Room , where ( they told me ) they searched her , and this is the Spoon which I missed , and which ( they said ) they found upon her . When I first charged her with taking it , she threatened me , and said , - whoever took it away would certainly have taken the rest , for there were two other little Spoons lay by it . Prisoner . I did take it up , and I thought to have laid it down again before I went out of the Room , - but I did not . Jos . Brian . She told me she lived with one Mr Foster , in the Temple ; and I went thither to enquire after her , but they knew nothing of her . Guilty . [ Transportation .

Mr Tarrant . I was not present when the Goods were taken : I was invited out on the 22d of April to spend the Evening ; and apprehending the Business of the Day was over , I went out about 8 o'Clock , and bid my Servant shut up the Shop : but I was immediately sent for , with a Message , . that my Servants had got two Shop-lifters ; upon which I returned immediately , and they told me they had taken this Piece of Linnen from the Prisoners ; it is my Property , and here is my Mark , and Number upon it : I am sure it was in the Shop when I went out , and I value it at 17s . James Hind . I am Servant to Mr Tarrant , and know this Piece of Sleezy to belong to him , there 's his Mark and mine upon it , and it is numbered . The two Prisoners came into the Shop on the 22d of April , under Pretence of buying some Printed Linnen ; I shewed them several Pieces ; they did not like any of them , but desired to see more . Accordingly I brought more forward , and at last Towers pitched upon one Piece , and gave me Six-pence earnest ; telling me , she must go and fetch her Mother , and if her Mother liked it she would have it , but if she did not she must have her Money again in a Quarter of an Hour . Then they were both going off , but from their Actions I mistrusted they had got something which did not belong to them , so I called them back again and searched them ; and this Piece of Cloth I took from under Bannister 's Cloak , and I am sure it was in the Shop when they came in . I asked Bannister when I called her back , what she had got under her Cloak ? Towers replied , - whatever she has got , it is none of yours . I desired to see it , and found it was ours , with our Marks on it . I shewed my Master ( when he came home ) the same Piece , which I had taken from under Bannister 's Cloak . Bannister . I had been out that Day in the Morning , with a Hundred and Half of Herrings , and in the Afternoon I was out with Raddishes : After which , Towers came and asked me to go with her to buy a Bit of Linnen . I told her I was too dirty to go to a Shop ; so she borrowed a Cloak for me , and while we were in this Shop , she gave me this Piece of Linnen to hold for her , and I thought she had paid for it . I had Opportunity enough to have gone off with it , if I had known she had not paid for it . Hind . The Piece of Linnen which I took from Bannister , was not the same she gave me earnest for . It was printed Linnen she pretended to buy . Both Guilty 4 s. 10d . [ Branding . See summary . ] 250.

When we asked her for them , she first said she knew nothing of them ; afterwards she said the Things were full of Milk at her Nurse 's . But when I bid her Husband get my Goods , he told me his Wife had pawned them . Upon this I called her down into my Parlour , and charged her with having pawned them , and she down 'd on her Knees , and confessed she had pawn 'd some of them at the Anchor , in White Cross-Street , and some in Barbican . This Confession she made last Sunday was a Fortnight , but , as she had Children , I was tender of prosecuting her ; and she took hold of my Coat , and said she would die by my side , if I was resolved to prosecute her . Afterwards , when she found I did not prosecute her , she told me she would prosecute me , and came several times to my Door , and called out - Dicky Price , why do n't you prosecute me ? I was forced to come from the Tavern one Night , to get her away from my Door . The Goods are in Court , and here are the Pawnbrokers , to whom she had pawned them .

On Saturday the 26th of April , I was obliged to go from my Shop in Westminster-Hall , to St James 's , and I got Mrs Gill at the next Shop to cast an Eye while I was gone . When I returned , I missed four Books , mentioned in the Indictment . In the Afternoon I enquired after them , and heard that such Books had been offered to be pawned at Mr Stone 's , in Long-Acre . I went thither , and found four Books of the same Title ; I believe they are mine , but I have no private Mark in them , so I can not be positive to them . I am sure I had four such Books in my Shop when I went out ; and when I returned , they were gone . Prisoner .

Prisoner . The Day before I pawn 'd these Books , I met a Man , who hawks Books about the Streets , and bought the odd Book of him : Then I asked him about these 4 Books , and he brought them to me the next Day , at an Alehouse , and I bought them ; but afterwards wanting Money , I pledg 'd them . As to bringing my Friends to my Character , - the Prosecutor lull 'd me up , in Hopes that I should not be prosecuted , and I did not care to disgrace my Family , by letting them know of this Misfortune . When I was sent to Newgate , the Prosecutor maintain 'd me , and I was remov 'd from the Common , to the Master-Side , and should have had nothing but the Prison-Allowance , if the Prosecutor had not given me Money .

I was about half an Hour from my Stall , and when I return 'd I miss 'd the French Dictionary , and got a Porter to look after my Stall , while I went about among the Trade , to desire them to stop it , if it should be offered to Sale . On Monday Morning Mr Wright , a Bookseller in Exeter-Exchange , inform 'd me , that he believed my Book was at Mr Stone 's , the Pawnbroker 's . I went thither , and saw it , and told him it was my Book . The Book which I lost , I found at Mr Stone 's . This is the Book , I believe 't is mine ; there were two Marks in it , when I lost it , which were made with a Black-lead Pencil , on the 2 Covers , at the Beginning and End of the Book ; but they are now rubb 'd out , and so they were , when I saw it at the Pawn-broker 's .

Mr. Warr found it at my House , the Monday after I took it in .

May 6 . Richard Mason . On the 6th of May , between two and three in the Afternoon , I was going to my Business at Colney-Hatch , and at the Bottom of the Long-Fields , by the Side of the Pond , I saw a Man well dress 'd , poking into it with a Stick ; He call 'd to me , and said , - there was a great Rat run into a Hole in the Bank ! It may be so , - said I , and upon that he came up from the Pond- side , and walk 'd on one side of me ; and in about five Minutes Time he pick 'd up a Catcher and Ball , and said he had found something . The Prisoner immediately came up , on my other Side , ( unseen by me , 'till he was at my Side ) and he wanted to buy the Catcher and Ball , of the Man who found it . I had no Knowledge of the Man who came up to me first , but I am sure the Prisoner is the Person who came up next , and wanted to buy the Catcher and Ball . They soon agreed for six-pence , and the Money being to be spent , they desired me to go with them , and drink a share of the Beer . Accordingly , I went with them to Spencer 's House , the Sign of the Adam and Eve , at the Side of Pancras-Church Yard , and we sat down on a Bench before the Door ; they call 'd for a Pint of Home-brew 'd , and the Boy that belongs to the House , came to the Door , and said to the Prisoner , - How do you do ? How does your Master do ? says the Prisoner , - I am just come from him at the Queen's-Head . After this , they desired me to walk in with them ; and we went into the Back-side of Spencer 's House , and sat down under the Back-shed . Then the Prisoner laid down his Hat , and desired Leave to go to the Little-house : When he returned , he brought in another Man , and this Man would lay a Wager of a Shilling , ( to make the Company drink ) that he caught the Ball in the Catcher , oftenest in 5 Times ; and one of them asked me to give him 2 Sixpences for a Shilling : I pull 'd out a Guinea , and four Shillings , and gave him 2 Sixpences , and immediately one of them snatch 'd the Guinea out of my Hand , and then they push 'd me out at the Back-Gate . I went away , and thought it was best to get from them ; but they all 3 followed me , and when I had got about 500 Yards from Spencer 's House , and about a Hundred Yards past the Corner of Fig-Lane , they made a full Stop upon me , and demanded my Watch . - They saw I had one , when I pull 'd out my Money at Spencer 's . One of them drew it out of my Pocket , and gave it to the Prisoner , who ran away with it over the Fields . They did not threaten me , but only laid hold of the Skirt of my Coat , and bid me give them my Watch : and one of them at the same Time drew it out of my Pocket , with the Cornelian Seal , set in Gold . - They first asked me , Where my Watch was ? One of them stopped me , by getting before me , and the others came up , one on each Side of me ; I was in such a Surprize , when they asked me for my Watch , that I could make no Answer . - ' I was the Man who caught hold of the Skirt of my Coat , that took my Watch out of my Pocket , and gave it to the Prisoner ; I have not been able to find him yet ; but I know his Face well . - To be sure I was afraid , when they follow 'd me , and demanded my Watch : And upon my Oath , the Prisoner was the Man , who got before me , and stopped me , when my Watch was demanded . After they had got my Watch , I went back to Spencers and asked for the Boy of the House , in order to be informed , if he knew any of these Persons ; but the Boy was not to be found , and there was nobody in the House would give me any Answer at all . Spencer ( the Landlord ) was not then in the House ( they said ) but I saw his Wife , tho ' I could not have a Sight of Him . I went a second Time to Spencer 's , and saw his Wife : She desired me not to make a Noise in the House , but to step into the back Yard with her , and there she told me , - If I would come again the next Day , and bring an Officer with me , I might take the Men , for they were then to come again to her House . Accordingly , I went thither the next Day , with an Officer , but no Person was to be seen , except Mrs Spencer , and she told me , I might have my Things again , if I would be easy . I let her know , that I did not want to have them again , upon which she said . - Lord ! Why my Husband has made up several of these Things , and the People have had their Goods again . When we found it was to no purpose to expect to take any of the Men at that House , we came away , and saw nothing of them , 'till the Day the last Prisoners were hang 'd ; and then I saw the Prisoner at the End of Parker's-Lane , as I was going up Holborn , I knew him again , and said to a Man , who was with me , - That 's the Man who ran away with my Watch . My Friend did not think proper to take him then , left we should be knock 'd on the Head ; but in the Evening of the same Day , we took him at a House , by Covent-Garden Playhouse . - I never got my Watch again from that Time to this . Jury 's Q . Did you play with any of the Men for the Watch ? Mason . No ; I did not play at all ; neither for the Watch , nor Money . Prisoner . Did not you lay me a Shilling , and did not you win it ? Mason . No , I laid no Wagers at all . Prisoner . Did you not lay down a Guinea , upon a Wager ? Mason . No , I did not ; when I pull 'd out my Money , to look for 2 Sixpences , they snatch 'd it from me . Prisoner . Did you not offer to sell us your Watch ? Mason . No ; I never did . Robert Rhodes . I am a Headborough , and went with the Prosecutor to Spencer 's at Pancras , to see for the Men who had robb 'd him , but not finding any of them , we went to several other Places , without any Success . But on last Execution-day at Night , we concluded to go to Covent-Garden Play-house to look for the Prisoner ; and there we met with one Purvis , who told us he had seen him about 5 Minutes before we came ; so we went to a Publick-house in James-Street , Covent-Garden , and there we found him ; I knew , and seized him , and told him he was my Prisoner . I think it was at the Sign of the One Boot . He asked me on what account I seized him ? I told him , it would be time enough to inform him when he came before Colonel De Veil. `` Why ( says he ) I know `` I must go to Newgate , and I am as well acquainted `` there , as I am here . I know what it `` is for : it was not me , who took the Man 's `` Watch , - it was another Man took it , and `` that other Man gave it to me , and I ran cross `` the Fields with it . '' I had not mentioned one Word about the Watch , when the Prisoner said this to me ; but we had been at Spencer 's about it , and Spencer offered Mason his Watch and his Money again , and I believe the Prisoner might have been informed by Spencer , that we were looking after him on Account of this Robbery . I do not know what he had about him , when he was taken , for we detained him at a Publick-house , till the Prosecutor came to us , and did not search him . When the Prosecutor came to us , he denied the Fact , and shammed drunk , and mad ; but I am sure he was sober when I laid hold of him , and he drank nothing at all afterwards . He behaved in a very insolent Manner before Colonel De Veil , and we were obliged to hand-cuff him : and as we were carrying him down Holborn , to Newgate , he told us , - if he had a Pistol , he would blow our Brains out . Prisoner . When this Man took me , there was one Mould with him ; and Mould pulled out a Pistol , and held it to my Breast , and said he would shoot me , if I did not come along . The Prosecutor said he sent me the Guinea , and lost his Watch at Play ; but they bid him swear it , - swear it ; and knock 'd me and my Wife down . Andrew Harter . When we took the Prisoner at the Publick House , I told him I had Colonel De Veil 's Warrant against him for a Robbery . Says the Prisoner , - `` I did not do it , - I `` was not the Person that took the Watch : there `` were three of us together ; and it was another `` who was in the Company took it , and they ran `` across the Fields with it . '' I can not swear that he said another Man delivered it to him , but the former Witness had been with the Prisoner two or three Minutes before I came in . - The Prosecutor was not present when the Prisoner said this . Jury . Was he charged with having taken the Watch from the Prosecutor , when he said this ? Harter . I told him I had a Warrant against him for a Robbery on the Highway ; but I can not say , whether I told him it was for taking a Watch , or not . I heard him say , he would blow our Brains out if he had a Pistol ; it was as we were carrying him in a Coach to Newgate . Mr Rhodes persisted in it that the Account he had given of the Prisoner 's Expressions , when he took him , was exactly true , and he repeated them again , agreeable to his former Evidence . Prisoner . He perswaded the Prosecutor to swear against me for the Sake of the Reward . Mr Rhodes . Upon my Oath , I did not speak to any one ; about swearing against him for the Sake of the Reward , nor do I want any of it . Thomas Simpson , Spencer 's Boy . I live at Spencer 's at Pancras , and have seen the Prisoner at the House two or three Times , but I can not tell when it was . Prisoner . Did not you see me at Spencer 's with the Prosecutor and another Man ; and did not you see me playing with the Catcher and Ball ? Simpson . Yes , I think it was the Prosecutor ; and another Man was with them : I carry 'd a Pint of Beer , and some Bread and Cheese , and saw the Prisoner with the Catcher in his Hand . I think this was in April last . Josiah Beltram . I keep a Barber 's Shop , and used to shave the Prisoner ; I have known him 2 or 3 Years : He always paid me honestly . - I can not tell what he does for a Living , - he does what People will employ him about . Guilty . Death . 253 , 254 . + Elizabeth West , and Anne Armstrong , of St Giles 's Cripple-Gate , were indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , val . 7l . the Goods of William Coster , in his Dwelling-house , May 16 . William Coster . I lost a Silver Tankard last Friday . The 2 Prisoners came into my House , ( the Sign of the Bell and Grenadier in Grub-Street ) about 9 in the Morning , and called for a Tankard of Beer . They were served with the Beer , in a Tankard without a Lid ; and after this , they sent for some Salmon , and then called for another Quart of Beer , which was carried to them in the Tankard which I lost . While they were drinking in the House , I had a Friend came to see me , and he said with me till 12 o'Clock ; I then asked him to step into the Kitchen and dine with me . While we were at Dinner , we heard the Door open , and my Wife asked me , if the Women had paid their Reckoning ? I told her yes . But have you taken care of the Tankard said she ? upon this I stepp 'd cut to look after it , and both Tankard and Women were gone . I saw it brought to them . They had it , and no one else ; for my Friend and I were drinking at the same Table , and they shoved themselves into our Company , and said they would drink with us . Their Reckoning came to 8 d. which they paid before my Friend and I went into the Kitchen to Dinner ; and while we were at Dinner I heard the Door open ; upon which I stepped into the Room to look for the Tankard , and missing it , I went out of Doors after the Prisoner . West I took in a Minute , upon the Spot , but she had nothing upon her . However , I carried her before Sir John Thompson , at Guildhall , who committed her to Newgate ; and just as I was carrying her thither , Mr Bennet a Goldsmith , came to Guildhall with the Tankard , and the other Prisoner , ( Armstrong , ) but Sir John Thompson being gone from the Hall , she was carried before my Lord Mayor , who committed her likewise . I saw the Tankard which Mr Bennet brought with him ; 't is mine , and 't is mark 'd W. C M. This is the same which the Prisoners had before them , and which I owned at Guildhall : about three Months ago , it cost me 8 l. 16 s. as near as I can remember ; but it was upwards of 8 l. I am sure . I have never seen the Prisoners since they were committed 'till now . Joseph Reader . On Friday the 16th of this Month , I went to Mr. Coster 's to drink a Pint of Beer . The two Prisoners were drinking in the same Room , and sent for some Salmon , and asked us to eat some . About 12 o'Clock Mr Coster invited me to dine with him ; and I went backwards with him into his Kitchen . While we were at Dinner , we heard the Door open , and the Prisoners being left with a Silver Tankard before them , Mrs Coster asked her Husband if he had taken Care of the Tankard , and told him the Creatures were gone . He went immediately from Table , and missing the Tankard , he ran out into the Street and took West . She was carried before Sir John Thompson , who committed her : and before we got away from Guildhall , the Gold-Smith brought Armstrong , and the Tankard , which was directly own 'd by Mr Coster . Mr Bennet . The Prisoner , Armstrong , came last friday Morning to my Shop , and offered this Tankard to Sale . I asked her whether she sold it for herself , or for another Person ? She told me it was her own . How long have you had it , said I ? She said her Husband bought it about 4 years ago ; but now she was necessitated to sell it . I desired to know what I must give her for it ? She told me , she supposed , I could not give less than 5 s. an Ounce . Why you undervalue it , says I , - 't is worth more : If I buy it , I will give more ; but what is your Husband 's Name ? She said his Name was Armstrong . I had got the Handle of the Tankard in my Hand , and having look 'd at it , I told her , there were no such Letters upon it . My Husband ( said she ) bought it at Second-hand , and there are not the Letters of his Name upon it . I bid her tell me what the Letters were , upon the Handle : She turn 'd herself round , but could not recollect what they were . Then I asked if she knew any body hereabout ? No . Can you send for People of Credit , who will satisfy me 't is your own ? If you can , you shall have it again . Why , says she , will you stop my Tankard ? I told her I would . Then she began to make a Noise , upon which I told her , I would stop her and the Tankard too ; and I sent my Servant for a Constable , and carried her and the Tankard to Guildhall , where I met with the Man who had lost it : He own 'd it , and the sitting Alderman being gone , she was carried before the Lord-Mayor who committed her . West . I had been drinking with this Armstrong at the Prosecutor 's House , and went home . The Prosecutor came after me , and took me in my own Yard . Coster . I pursu 'd her , and took her in her own House , and there are but two Doors between the House where she lives and mine . West . I own I was drinking with her , but I know nothing of the Tankard . Armstrong . Yes ; we had both been drinking plentifully ; but I know nothing of the Tankard . Jury . How long was it after you miss 'd the Tankard , before you took West ? Coster . I took her in 2 Minutes after I had miss 'd it ; but I saw nothing of Armstrong , 'till she was brought to Guildhall . Thomas Molding confirm 'd Part of Mr Bennet 's Evidence . West acquitted . Armstrong Guilty , Death . 255 , 256 . + Martha Harding , and Rachel Bowling , were indicted for privately stealing 4s . 6 d. from the Person of John Pepper , May 14 . John Pepper . Those two Prisoners robbed me of 4 s. 6 d. and some Half pence , last Tuesday was se'nnight in the Morning , - Wednesday Morning I think it was , between 2 and 3 , or 3 and 4 o ' Clock in the Morning . I was with them in Half-Moon-Alley , in Bishopgate-Street , and they there picked my Pocket , and tore my Pocket out , and afterwards hurl 'd it at me again . I was sensible of what they were doing ; I felt them , and strove to save my Pocket , as much as I could , for it was done with Force . When they had got my Money , and had tore off my Pocket , they flung that to me again , - here it is to shew . - Then they ran away , and I ran after them , and call 'd the Watch , - here 's my Pocket . I had been out with my Cart to do some Business , in Gravel Lane , in Petticoat Lane , and when I had unloaded the Cart , I sent it home by another Man , and staid drinking in Gravel Lane , 'till towards Morning ; then I set out in Order to go home , and as I came through Hand Alley into Bishopsgate-Street , I saw a Man before me , and two Women a little before the Man . The Man asked me , Where I was going ? I told him , I was going home to the Three Cranes : But he desiring me to go with him and drink a Pint of Beer , I went with him ; and while we were drinking the Beer , in came the 2 Prisoners , and called my Companion their Brother . When the Reckoning came to be paid , he had got no Money , but yet he called for another Pint of Beer , and I paid for all . Then they carried me into Half-moon-alley , and robbed me . I had no Familiarity with them at all . Prisoners . Ask him if either of us were near him , for I never saw him before ? Pepper . They were the Women , and none else , I know them very well ; but I never saw them before that Morning , and I never desire to see them any more . Francis Hunt . Last Wednesday Morning was se'nnight , between 3 and 4 in the Morning , the Prosecutor came running out of Half-moon-alley , as hard as he could , and complained that two Women came up to him , one on each Side , and had pulled out his Money , Pocket and all , and had flung his Pocket at him again . The two Prisoners came out of White Hind Court , ( while the Man went back to see for them , ) and they went round some Ruins into Three Tunn Alley , and so into White Hind Court again . I saw them as soon as I came out of the Court , and Thomas Whaley , ( a Brother Watchman ) and I , stopped them , between Sweet-Apple Court , and Dunning 's Alley . The Prosecutor charged us with them , for robbing him of 4s . 6d . and some Half-pence . They fell to swearing and damning , and said they had none of his Money , not they ; - they had no more than a Penny or Three half pence about them , which they would lay out for a Dram to make us drink . But the Prosecutor being positive to that , we carried them to the Watch-house , and by the Constable 's Order , I searched that Creature ( Harding ) as far as Modesty would let me ( for I am a little modest ) and then I searched Bowling ; she gave me a Tap with her Toe , upon the Small of my Leg , ( which I did not understand the Meaning of ) and not finding any Money upon them , Whaley went to see , if we could find any had been dropp 'd among the Tubs in White Hind Court , or in a Vault there , into which such Creatures as these often retire . Not finding any we returned to the Watch-house , and the Constable bid us search the Prisoners again , and accordingly I pulled off Bowling 's Shoes , and felt from her Knees , all over her Stockings . Then I would have searched Harding , but she resisted , and we were forced to get three Watchmen to hold her ; then I got one Leg over my Knee , as the Farriers shoe Horses , and just by the left Side of her Ancle-Bone , I found Half a Crown , a Shilling , and Three-half-pence . Here is the Money , and one of the Half-pence is whited on one Side , as the Blind-man in Moorfields whitens Buckles . I found there was Money in her Stocking , and there being a Hole in it , another Watchman picked it out , through the Hole with his Finger . Harding . But it was my own Money . Pepper . The Money I lost , was one Half-Crown , two Shillings , and some Half-pence . Thomas Whaley confirmed the former Evidence . Joseph Key 's Evidence was agreeable to Hunt 's and Whaley 's . He likewise deposed , that Half a Crown , a Shilling , and Some Half-pence were found in Harding 's Stocking , after they had both swore they had no Money about them . They were both acquitted of the privately Stealing ; but were found Guilty of single Felony . [ Transportation .

Mrs Peck . I live in Jermyn-Street , and missed the Goods mentioned in the Indictment , out of an Escrutore in my Dining-room , on Sunday the 27th of April last . I heard nothing of them till the Thursday following ; and then Crates , ( the next Witness ) came ; between 3 and 4 o'Clock , and desired to know if I had not lost any Cloaths ? I told him I had . He described the Things I had lost , and I shewed him a Piece of Silk , which he said was of the same Sort with some of them . Then a Man , who came with the Evidence , told me , I must go to Colonel De Veil 's , where I might see the Goods and swear to them : but when I got there , I was informed they had been sold to one John Johnson in Holborn , on the same Day they were stole . The Colonel sent for him and the Cloaths , and he refused to come . He sent for him a second Time , and threatened to fetch him with a Warrant ; upon which he promised to come that Night , or next Morning . The Messenger went for him again , and then both Johnson and his Wife were abroad ; but upon the Colonel 's sending for him next Morning , he came ; and I saw my Things and swore to them . Prisoner . Ask her if she lost no more Things ? Mrs Peck . There was another quilted Coat stole , but that was not mine . Prisoner . She said , before Colonel De Veil , she had lost a Handkerchief and a Pair of Stockings . Mrs. Peck . No ; it was Coates said so . I did not know that I had lost the quilted Coats , till I came home ; and I could not swear to them , till after I had been at home : then I found the white Coat was mine . George Coates . About five Weeks ago , the Prisoner and I , and Alexander Flack + , were going along Jermyn-street , about one o'Clock in the Afternoon , and the Street-door of this Lady 's House being open , the Prisoner went up Stairs , and brought down 3 Petticoats , 2 Gowns , a Pair of Stays , and old Handkerchief , and an old Pair of Stockings . They were brought out , in the Middle of the Day , and we carried them to Arthur Bethell * , who said , he could dispose of them , if they were worth 50 l. The Handkerchief and the Stockings we gave away : the rest of the Things Arthur Bethell carried into Holborn . We bid him ask 5 Guineas for them , but he brought us no more than three . He told us he could get no more , so we had a Guinea a-piece , and gave him 2s . for his Trouble . + See last Oct . Sessions . No . 512 . * See the following Trial . Mrs. Peck . These are the Things , and they are the same which I lost . A Witness . I went for them , by the Prisoner 's Direction , and found them . Coates . Arthur Bethell , who disposed of them for us , is in Custody for robbing a Man of his Watch and Money , in the Street . These are the very same Things which the Prisoner brought out of Mrs Peck 's House . We tied them up in two Bundles at Flack 's Room , and then carried them to Bethell to dispose of them for us . Arthur Bethell . I know nothing of the Lady 's Cloaths , - I know nothing of Coates , ( the Evidence ; but I know his Wife . 'T is she that has sworn against me about a Watch . Prisoner . Mr Perry , and Mr Miller , got this Robbery Sworn against me , for the Sake of the 2 Guineas Reward , which the Lady was to give to have her Cloaths again . Perry . When I took the Prisoner , he fell down on his Knees , and desired to be made an Evidence . Miller . He did endeavour to be made an Evidence against Coates , and did not deny the Fact , when he was before Colonel De Veil . Acquitted . 258 , 259 . + Arthur Bethell , alias Bethwell , alias Barwin , and Martha White were indicted for assaulting Edward Edwards on the King 's Highway , putting him in fear , & c. and taking from him , a Silver Watch , val . 3 l. and 3 s. in Money , April 26 . Edward Edwards . Last Saturday was 3 Weeks between 10 and 11 at Night , as I was coming into Drury-Lane , I was knocked down , and robbed of my Watch ; and after this , I was follow 'd , and was robb 'd of my Money , - 3 s. and three-half-pence . I ca n't tell the Name of the Street . - I think 't was in Baldwin 's ( Short 's ) Gardens . After I had been knock 'd down , and lost my Watch , I got up , and being frighted , I went away ; but they followed me , and knocked me down again , and took my Money away . After this , I got up , and made the best of my Way home . There was 2 or 3 of them , but who they were , who were concern 'd in these Facts , I can not tell . Bethell . Ask him if he had not been in any Woman 's Company that Night ? Edwards . Yes : I had been with a School-fellow of mine , one Mary Groves , and only drank a Pot of Beer with her ; and when I came out of the House where we had been drinking , this Woman ( the Evidence ) followed me . I had been drinking with my School-fellow , somewhere in Covent Garden . Bethell . Was not you above Stairs with that Woman ? Edwards . No , Bethel . Ask him if he did not want to go up Stairs at that House , with the Evidence ? Edwards . I did ask to go up Stairs with her ; but the People of the House would not let me ; for , as the People of the House told me , I was a little in Liquor . Bethell . Did not you go out of the House with the Evidence , and walk a Quarter of a Mile with her ? Edwards . When I came out of the House , I left my Country-Woman there behind me ; she wanted to go home with me , but I would not let her ; and after I had got into the Street , Margaret Casey , ( the Evidence ) followed me , and went Part of the Way with me ; 'till she lit of the 2 Prisoners , and then I was robbed . I was twice knock 'd down , but I did not cry out , for I did not see any body in the Street , and I endeavoured to get out of their Hands . They had my Watch among them , and pawn 'd it by 11 o'Clock the same Night . Prisoner . Did not you drink with Casey , in another House , after you had left your Country-woman ? Edwards . Yes ; she carried me to the Prisoner Bethell 's House , where we had a Quartern of Liquor ; but this was before I was robb 'd . And when I went out of the Prisoner 's House , they followed me , and knocked me down . Margaret Casey . I was in a House at Covent-Garden , last Saturday Night was 3 Weeks , between 10 and 11 at Night , and the Prosecutor came in with Mary Groves , and drank a Pot of Beer with her . While he was drinking , he took it into his Head not to like Mary Groves , so I asked him to go up Stairs with me , but the Woman of the House would not permit us to go up together ; because he was very much in Liquor : So I asked him to come along with me , and give me a Dram ; he consented , and I carried him to the Prisoner Bethell 's House , where we had a Quartern of Gin , which cost 6 d. Bethell said , He ( the Prosecutor ) has got a Watch , and Money I want , and Money I will have ; and when he went out of the House , He , and Martha White , and I , followed him , - we all three followed him out of the House . He was not above 2 Minutes in the House , before he went out , alone , and we went after him directly , and in Short's-Gardens , Bethell knock 'd him down , took his Watch , and gave it into White 's Hand , and she put it into her Pocket Apron . After this he told us , He had as good be hang 'd for an old Sheep , as a young Lamb , and he would follow him again . He did so , and in Drury Lane , at the Corner of Short 's Gardens , he knock 'd him down again , and took 3 s. and some Halfpence from him , which he likewise gave to White ; and we had each of us a Shilling a-piece , but the Halfpence were not divided . Then we all came back to Bethell 's House , and we looked at the Watch ; Martha White took off the Seal , and the Green Ribbon , which was in the Watch , and pull 'd off the Ribbon which was-upon her Head , and put into it . We then all went into Oxendon Street , to a Pawnbroker 's , and Bethell went in with the Watch , while we stood at the Corner of the other Street , and pawn 'd it for 22 s. ( as the Pawnbroker tells us ) tho ' he brought us but a Guinea . As soon as the Watch was pawn 'd , we went to a House at the Corner of Oxendon Street , and had 2 Pints of mull 'd Wine together : Bethell changed a Guinea there , and gave me a Crown out of the Money , besides the Expence ; the rest of it He and White kept to themselves . When the Man was knock 'd down , he did not cry out , for he was so much in Liquor , that really he did not mind it , nor who did it , but seem 'd glad to get away as he could . We all 3 went after the Prosecutor upon this Design , and were to have assisted him , had there been any Occasion . White heard Bethell say , he wanted , and would have Money , before we went out , and she was nearer to him , when the Man was robbed , than I was . She was not with me , when I first pick 'd the Man up ; but when I brought him to the Prisoner 's House , she served us with the Gin . This is the same Watch , and this is the String White pull 'd off her Head , and put into it . Bethell . Had you no more than one Quartern in our House ? Casey . No , not a Drop , 'till we came home from pawning the Watch ; we then had more Liquor together at Bethell 's House , and I went in Liquor to bed with him and his Wife , ( White . ) I had been acquainted at the Prisoner 's House before this Time , and have drank Drams in it before . I ca n't tell whether the 2 Prisoners are Man and Wife , or not : Col. De Veil committed them when they kept a disorderly Night-Cellar , for not being Man and Wife ; I know they live together . Nathaniel Brown . Bethell brought a Silver Watch to me , on Saturday Night , the 26th of April , and borrowed 22 s. upon it . They have said it was about 11 o'clock , - I ca n't be positive to the Hour ; I thought it had been sooner . This is the Watch , and I then took it in from him , but he had it again from me on the Monday following . I know it again , and describ 'd it when Col. De Veil sent for me : And I told him I could swear to it , if I could see it . When Bethell brought it to me he was in Mourning , and had been with me , ( 2 or 3 Days before he pawn 'd this Watch ) to cheapen one for himself ; and told me that an Aunt of his , in Jermyn-Street , had left him 20 l. When he came to pawn this Watch on Saturday Night , he told me , he had bought it of one Johnson in Holbourn ; but it seems this Johnson is the Man to whom he sold it , after he had redeem 'd it from me . I had seen him once or twice , before he came to cheapen the Watch ; and when he came to pawn this , I thought it was his own , and believed he had bought one . Edwards . This is my Watch : I bought it of Mr Haddon , in the Strand . Prisoner White . My Husband ( Bethell ) and Casey , can both clear me , for I know nothing of the Matter . Prisoner Bethell . Casey came into my House with the Prosecutor , and my Wife carried them a Dram . - White . Did I carry it ? Bethell . Yes , you carried it in , and the Man paid 6 d. for it , and went out of the House . He wanted to go to Bed , but we could not let him , upon which he went out of the House , and Casey staid behind him 3 Quarters of an Hour ; and after that she went out , and returned with a Watch , which she said was her Husband 's who was in Gaol , and I , being in Liquor , pawned it for a Guinea , 22 s. and she had every Penny of the Money . On the Monday following I heard she had picked this Man 's Pocket , so I went and redeemed it . Ann Eager . I am Servant to Mr Richards , who keeps the House in Covent-Garden , where the Prosecutor came to call for a Pot of Beer ; the Evidence ( Casey ) brought him into the House , but I do not know what Day it was ; I know her to be a Pick-pocket , and my Master bid me turn her out of the House . Then I asked the Man if he had lost any Thing ? He said no ; and turning the Flap of his Wastcoat aside , I saw his Watch was safe . After this , He and Casey went out together , and no one else was with them . I saw no Woman with the Prosecutor , but Casey ; she brought him in , and she went out with him . I remember his coming in , and going out ; and I know the Prosecutor again . - That is the Man , and I saw no Woman with him , but the Evidence . Jury . Did they drink together at your House ? Eager . No ; not as I know of ; they did not stay half a Quarter of an Hour in our House , because my Master saw him in Liquor ; and so he bid him go home . When I first saw him , he was going up Stairs with Casey , but I pulled him down by the Coat , and then they both went out of doors together . Next Morning he came , and told us he had lost his Watch . I never saw either of the Prisoners before . Edward Allen deposed , that himself was a Man of very good Character , and that Bethell had lodged with him about 3 Months , and worked at one Jasper 's , a Baker , next Door to his House , in Great Earl Street . That he received 20 l. from the King 's Apothecary , about 3 Weeks before this Trouble came upon him . That he always behaved well , and bore a good Character , and that he set himself up with the 20 l. he had received , in this House , in Short 's Gardens ( where the Prosecutor drank the Gin ) and kept a Chandler 's Shop . Elizabeth Bethwin gave an Account that Bethell , alias Bethwin , was a Journey-man Baker at Highgate , last Summer was a Twelvemonth ; and since that in St. John Street ; and that afterwards , he lived with his Uncle , a Cutler . That she had married the Prisoner 's Uncle , and she never heard any thing ill of him before . Sam Fisher had been acquainted with Bethell , ever since he was a Child , he never heard any thing amiss of him , but took him to be a little soft , ( or foolish ) and did not believe he could have the Heart to do such a Thing . Mrs Bethwin spoke to the same Effect . James Desca had known White about 4 Years ; he let a Cellar to her Mother , and the Prisoner ( White ) had been in his Kitchen to fetch Water , and he had not missed any thing . He took her to be a lewd Woman , but never heard she was a Thief . William Raven knew her , but had heard neither Good , nor Harm of her . William Meakin swore he saw Bethell and White married at the Fleet * . * The Law supposing every Wife to be under the Coercion of her Husband , White called this Witness to prove her Marriage , that she might receive the Benefit arising from thence . Bethell Guilty , Death . White Acquitted . 260. John Hall was indicted for stealing a Half-peck Loaf , val , 16 d. and 2 Quartern Loaves , val . 16 d. the Goods of Edward Trenance , May 22 . It appeared upon the Evidence , that the Prisoner was Trenance 's Journey-man , and being left at work in his Master 's Cellar , he carried out the 3 Loaves in a Bag , between 12 and 1 o'clock in the Night ; but being seen by an opposite Neighbour , who stopped him , he acknowledged he had done , what was not right . Trenance deposed , That he had not sent him out with the 3 Loaves , and that he never sent him out with any thing but Halfpenny Rolls , at that Time of Night . He swore , the Bread found on the Prisoner was his Property . Solomon Goldsmith , a Baker in the Little-Old-Bailey , gave the Prisoner a good Character . Guilty + 10 d. + The felonious and fradulent taking and carrying away the mere Personal Goods of another , not laid to be from his Person , nor out of his House , is Simple Larceny ; if the Goods be above the value of 12 d. it is Grand Larceny ; if of that value , or under , Petit Larceny . The Punishment for Grand Larceny is to be branded in the Hand , for Petit Larceny to be whipt ; or the Court may order the Offenders , in both Cases , to be Transported for 7 Years . [ Whipping . See summary . ] 261. Rochford Fitzgerald , of St Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted , for that he , on the First of February , 1738 feloniously made and forged , and caused to be made and forged , a certain false and counterfeit Order for the Payment of Money , in the Words and Figures following , viz . London 27 December 1738 . Messieurs Knight and Shuttleworth . Pay Mr Rochford Fitzgerald , or Bearer , Fourteen Days after Date , Twelve Pounds Ten Shilings . L. 12 10 o For Richd . Lutterell and Comp ' . Change Alley . With Intent to defraud Robinson Knight , and Edward Shuttleworth , Bankers , in Exchange Alley , against the Form of the Statute , & c. The Indictment further charged him with uttering and publishing the said counterfeit Order ( as above ) he well knowing it to be false and counterfeit , with Intent to defraud Mess . Knight and Shuttleworth , & c. He was farther charged , as in the first Count in the Indictment , with Intent to defraud Patrick Cannon , of St Martin 's in the Fields , Vintner , against the Form of the Statute , & c. He was likewise charged with uttering and publishing the same , with Intent to defraud Patrick Cannon , & c. The Councel for the Prosecution having opened the Indictment , and the Nature of the Offence , the Witnesses were call 'd . Patrick Cannon . I know this Paper , 't is a Draught on Knight and Shuttleworth . I had it for a Security , and I was taken up last New-Year 's Day was Twelvemonths , on Account of this Note , at Messieurs Knight and Shuttleworth 's , in Change-Alley . I went thither to get the Note accepted , and tendered it to Mr Shuttleworth himself : He desired me to stay a little , and told me he thought Mr Lutterel was not then ( a Trader ) in Company , but he said he would send for him , and accordingly he did , and asked him if the Name Richard Lutterel and Company was his Hand ? He told him it was not ; upon which I was taken up , and carried before the Lord Mayor ; but was discharged , because I only came with it for Acceptance . I had it from the Prisoner ; he came to my House , the Sign of the Cannon in Suffolk-Street , with two Bailiffs , and desired me to Bail him in a Action for 6 Guineas . I told him I did not care to be bail for him , because I had suffered before , by being bail , and had paid the Money . He said , - because you shall not be under any Apprehensions of losing by me , here 's a Note , ( but the Money is not yet due , ) take it for your Security , and I shall be obliged to you . So I took it as a Security , and had it 6 or 8 Days , in my Pocket . 'T is now in the same Condition as it was when I received it from the Prisoner , and when I tendered it for Acceptance , excepting that my Name Pa. Cannon , is wrote upon the back . I have known the Prisoner 2 or 3 Years ; and I know his Hand-writing : I have seen him write several Times . I take the Words Lutterel and Company , to be the Prisoner 's Hand : All the Note I think is the Prisoner 's Hand-writing , and I have seen him write several Times . Prisoner 's Q . You speak of something on the Back of the Note ; - What was wrote on the Back ? Cannon . When I tendered the Note for Acceptance , Mr Lutterel was sent for , and he asked me my Name , and where I lived ? I told him , and he wrote it on the Back of the Note . I did not examine the Note when I took it , but thought it a very good one , seeing it drawn on checqu 'd Paper , and I read it , at the same Time ; and thinking it was a good Note , I did not take much Notice of it . Prisoner 's Q . Did you take it to be my Handwriting , when you received it from me ? Cannon . No ; I did not . I did not know but it might be Mr Lutterel 's Hand-writing . Prisoner 's Q . Was not you acquainted with my Hand-writing before ? Cannon . Yes ; but I could not then tell whether 't was his , or no : If I had taken it to have been the Prisoner 's Hand-writing , to be sure I should not have carried it to the Bankers for Acceptance . Prisoner 's Q . Was not I arrested that Morning ; and had not I some Discourse with you ( before this Note was given you ) about your being Bail for me ? Cannon . Yes : He was arrested that Morning , and I did not chuse to be Bail for him . He had sent for me before this , to be Bail for him for 32 l. which I refus 'd ; but this he said was a Trifle , 't was but for 6 Guineas . Prisoner 's Q . Did not you say , you did not care to be Bail , because you should disoblige your Wife ? Cannon . I ca n't tell whether there was any Discourse at all , about my Wife . I never consult her about these Things . Prisoner 's Q . How long was it , after I came in , that you bail 'd me ? Cannon . In about 8 or 10 Minutes . Prisoner 's Q . Was the Note given , before you bail 'd me , or after ? Cannon . I ca n't resolve that Question : I think it was given me , for a Security , if I would bail him . I told him , I did not care to be Bail for him , and he gave me this Note , as a Security , and said it would be the same as Money . He told me , it was not yet due , and therefore , he could not then command the Money . Prisoner 's Q . Did not you say , you must have something to shew your Wife , before you could give Bail . Cannon . I never mentioned a Word about my Wife , when he talked about my being his Bail , as I know of . I think the Note was given me , after I had bail 'd him . I was not willing to be bail for him , but when he offered me the Note for a Security , I agreed to be his Bail . The Note was read , as inserted in the Indictment , and on the Back thereof was wrote , - Pa. Cannon , in Suffolk-Street . Prisoner 's Q . You say , you was taken up , on New-Year 's Day was a Twelvemonth ; When did you see me after that ? Cannon . The next Day ; and several Times afterwards , but he was not taken up on this Account . The Prisoner came to me the next Day after I was taken up ; and asked me , if I had not been in the City , with Mr Lutterel ? I said , No , I have not . He reply 'd , I thought I had seen you with him . And at that very Time , I sent for Mr Mark Lawn , and told him I would not let the Prisoner go , 'till I was satisfied for the Money I had bail 'd him for . The Prisoner then said , he was sorry for what he had done , but Mr Lutterel ( he said ) had given him Liberty , to draw upon his Checques . He farther told me , he had been with Mr Lutterel , and had desired him not to give the Note out of his Hands . Prisoner 's Q . Had not I surrendered myself , in Discharge of my Bail , at that Time ? Cannon . No , for on Saturday after this , he came to my House , in the Afternoon , and said , he had paid the Debt , or made it easy ; but on the Monday following I had Notice , that if I did not come and pay the Money , I should be sued ; so I went and gave in Bail above ; which cost me 8 s. After this he gave me his Sword , and two Guineas for my Security . Prisoner 's Q . Have not I been often at your House for these 8 Months last past ; and have not I been visible , and publick , in other Places ? Cannon . Yes ; I believe he hath . Prisoner 's Q . Have you not declared , that at the Time the Note was given you , you knew it was my Hand Writing , and that it was deposited with you , only to make your Wife easy . Cannon . No ; I swear I never did . Mr Lutterel was called , but the Prisoner 's Counsel observing that the Indictment charged the Prisoner , with intending to defraud the said Mr Lutterel , the Court were of Opinion he could not be permitted to give Evidence , because he was concerned in Point of Interest . The Prisoner admitted the Note in Question , to be his own Hand-writing . Edward Masters . I can not positively say I heard the Prisoner say he forged this Note , but I advised him to go abroad on Account of forging it . Prisoner 's Q . After this Note was given , was not I visible , and to be seen ? Mr Masters . Yes ; I have seen him at Can non 's House , after the Note was given , and after Cannon had been carried before the Lord Mayor : I can not tell how often I have seen there ; I have met him in the Streets , within these three or four Months , but have not seen him at Cannon 's House , within these 8 Months last past . Formerly I have seen him in Mr. Lutterel 's Company , but not since the Date of this Note . Couns . But when you advised him to go abroad did he not take your Advice ? Mr Masters . He went abroad some time afterward , - 't was some Time in the latter End of January ; how long he staid abroad , I ca n't tell . Mr Shuttleworth was called , and as it appeared that he refused to accept the Note , he could not be concerned in Point of Interest , therefore he was admitted to give Evidence . Mr Shuttleworth . Tho ' the Note was brought to me , I was not liable to pay it , unless I had accepted it . I had Money of Mr Lutterel 's in my Hands , and had the Note come from him , I should have paid it . This Note was brought to me , by Cannon , on the 1st of Feb. 1738 , for Acceptance . I knew it was not Mr Lutterel 's Hand , but if I had not happened to have seen it , I do not know but our Servants might have accepted it . Couns . When you saw it was not Mr Lutterel 's Hand , did not you give him Notice ? Mr Shuttleworth . Yes , I sent for him . Couns . Did you ever pay any Draught to the Prisoner , in Mr Lutterel 's Name ? Mr Shuttleworth . No , never in my Life , as I know of . We had had several Draughts forged upon us ; one in particular for 154 l. which made me the more careful at that Time . Couns . Did not Mr Lutterel 's Draughts used to be in the Name of Lutterel and Company ? Mr Shuttleworth . Yes , formerly they did , but not lately : not when this Note was made . Couns . Was not the Note shewn to Mr Lutterel , at the Time it came to be accepted ? Mr Shuttleworth . Yes , it was , in order to be carried to my Lord Mayor 's ; and it has been either in his Hands , or mine , or the Attorney 's , ever since . We gave it to the Attorney , that he might take out a Warrant for the Prisoner ; but he was not taken up , for he fled ; as I was told by Mr Barnard the Attorney . Couns . [ to Cannon ] Was you acquainted with Mr Lutterel 's Hand-writing , as well as the Prisoner 's ? Cannon . I can not say I am ; I never saw him write in my Life . Defence . Cannon says I came to him with two Officers , - I had been with him to tell him that I had had the Officers with me , on Account of a Debt which was not my own ; and not being willing to pay it , I desired him ( Cannon ) to pay it , and I appointed the Officers to come to his House , and I would meet them there . Accordingly I went thither and drank Frontiniac above Stairs , and told him I had been arrested , and by whom ; and I desired him to be Bail for me , telling him I should have Money in a few Days . He made no Objection to it ; but said , he had no kind of Doubt that he should suffer by me , I having often owed him more Money and paid him . Afterwards he told me , he apprehended it might occasion some Family Disturbance , and begged to be excused from bailing me , unless I could contrive to silence the Family Disturbance : upon which I took this Piece of chequed Paper out of my Pocket , which I had from Mr Fitzgerald , who is Mr Lutterel 's Clerk , to make some Draughts upon Mr Lutterel , by Order of a Gentlewoman who had Cash in his Hands , and upon a Piece of this chequed Paper I wrote this Draught , desiring him not to use it ; and telling him , I gave it him to silence the Disturbance in his Family , till I brought him the Money , or the Plaintiff 's Discharge . And in this Confidence in him , that it should not be made Use of , I gave him this Draught , and made it payable not till 14 Days after Date . But the Day after , he being pressed for Money , goes into the City and offers the Note , telling me I was a good-natured Man , and he believed , that as I was intimate with Mr Lutterel , the Sanction of my Name would have influenced Mr Lutterel to pay it . What I have farther to offer , is , that I had at that time several accepted Notes of Mr Lutterel 's in my Possession , and therefore it is not to be supposed that I should do this with an Intent to defraud him , and I put the Word Company to his Name , left it should be made an ill use of . Mr Lutterel told me , ( being married to one of his Family , and being often at his House , and seeing his Letters , and being conversant in his Counting-house , and in his Business ) that he was assured I did neither intend , or mean , to injure him or Mr Shuttleworth f , but that I had done an imprudent Thing ; therefore ( says he ) go and discharge Cannon from any Demand he has upon you . Accordingly , though I never intended to have paid this Debt of 6 l. yet as I had done so imprudent a Thing . I went and paid it ; and yet after all this , Cannon ( being spirited up by some People who are pleased to have some little Jealousy of me , ) goes before Colonel De Veil , and makes an Affidavit of all this , upon which there was a Warrant taken out against me , and I was advised to step out of the way : I refused to go , at first ; because that would look like Guilt ; but afterwards having 157 l. due to me at Dunkirk , I applied to Mr George Fitzgerald , in the City , and he gave me a Letter of Recommendation , that I might be assisted in the Recovery of the Debt ; and having a Gentlewoman that lived with me , at that time there , I promised to come and see her at Dunkirk , for which End , I sent over some Money and Cloaths , and went to her , because some of her Friends and mine were disobliged at our living together ; so I took that Opportunity to go thither ; and an Affair about a Bankruptcy detain 'd me there , longer than I intended to stay . But since my coming back , I have been several times at Mr Lutterel 's , and fifty times at Cannon 's House ; and I have dined there often , I imputed this Transaction to his Ignorance rather than to any Design ; but being there one Sunday Evening playing a Game at Cards , Cannon , who served the Wine , was pleased to make some Observations on the Game , which since has subjected me to another * Indictment : He alledging that I subjected the Gentleman ( my Partner ) to the Loss of the Game , that I might come in , for a Share of his Money which he was to lose . I intended to have prosecuted Cannon for this Aspersion , and so he brought this Prosecution against me . * See the Conclusion of last Sessions Paper . Mr Shuttleworth was asked if he gave this chequed Paper to People , that were to draw upon him ? He answered yes , and that he believed the Cheque upon which this forged Note was drawn , was one of his . Robert Gill . I , and Matthias Powel arrested Fitzgerald , in St Martin 's Street , near Liecester-Fields , some Time in December last was a Twelve month ; he was carry 'd to the Py 'd Bull , in Grays Inn Lane , and afterwards to Cannon 's House . There was nobody with us at Cannon 's , but Powel and I , the Prisoner , and Powel 's Man . We went up Stairs , and I was one of his Bail , with Cannon . I do n't remember any Talk about the Note , nor did I see any Note given . Cannon had been applied to before , to bail the Prisoner , in an Action in the Sheriff 's Court for 30 l ; but his Bail was not thought sufficient at that Time . In this Action for 6 Guineas , Robert Fitzgerald was Plaintiff , and the Suit was in the Marshalsea Court ; and when the Prisoner proposed Cannon to be his Bail , he said , he did not want any Security at all ; he said nothing about this Note ; I did not see any thing of it ; nor was there any thing said about Cannon 's Wife . Couns . Where did you first see Cannon ? Gill . At the Py 'd Bull in Gray 's Inn Lane . Fitzgerald and Cannon were together there , and I went with them from thence to Cannon 's House . Couns . Might not the Prisoner and Cannon be together , when you was not present ? Gill . I was not with them all the Time , for we staid at Fitzgerald 's Lodgings , while he went to see for Bail . Couns . How soon was the Bail given , after you came to Cannon 's House ? Gill . It was given directly , as soon as possibly it could be done . Prisoner 's Q . What did Cannon say , when I asked him to be Bail for me , for the Six Guineas ? Gill . Fitzgerald put his Hand in his Pocket , and pulled out some Money ; Cannon said , he did not want Money at all ; his Honour was sufficient . This was just before he gave Bail . Mark Lawn . I went to Cannon 's House when the Prisoner was arrested : Cannon told me Fitzgerald was arrested for 6 Guineas , and was above Stairs with two Officers . Before I went away , Cannon went up Stairs , and when he came down again , he told me , he had bail 'd him , and he had a Note in his Hand . I looked at it , and said 't was a Draught on Messieurs Knight and Shuttleworth . No , says Cannon , 't is his own Hand-writing . Why says I , do you think the Man would be such a Fool to do such a Thing ? Cannon immediately put his Hand in his Pocket , and pulled out a Letter , which he said was his Hand-writing too . I laugh 'd at him , and said it was a Joke . I told him , 't was a good Note on Messrs. Knight and Shuttleworth : No , said he , 't is his own Handwriting : I know it as well as I do my own . I insisted upon it , that no Man in his Senses would do such a Thing ; upon which he put his Hand in his Pocket , and pulled out the Letter ; I compared the Note and the Letter , and never saw two Things so much alike in my Life ; and then I believed it . This was 5 or 10 Minutes , or a Quarter of an Hour before the Officers went out of the House . When he shew 'd me the Note , he said to me , I would have bailed the Prisoner , had he given me nothing ; but he gave me this , and I know 't is his Hand-writing . Prisoner . Did he give you no Reason why he took the Note , when he said he would have bailed me for nothing ? Lawn . No ; he did not . I might think what I pleased , but he said nothing to me about his Wife . I never saw the Prisoner above once or twice , before he came to Cannon 's to be bailed . I thought it was done to satisfy his Wife , as such Things are often done to make a Family easy ; but he did not say any thing about his Wife . Couns . And would you see a false Note produced under a Gentleman 's Hand , and not complain of the Fraud . Lawn . Am I to be busy , and complain , when the Man ( Cannon ) told me himself , that he knew it was Fitzgerald 's own Writing ? I think I should have done very ill , if I had told of it , in any Company . I was glad to see Fitzgerald out of Custody . Couns . Where did you learn such Principles ? Of Wreatbock ? Lawn . I knew Mr Wreatbock , but what 's that to me ! Since the Prisoner came from France , I have been in his Company ; and have seen Cannon with him ; and so I have after Cannon had been taken up about this Note . I was with , him when he left his Sword and 2 Guineas with him as a Security for the 6 Guineas , after the Note was discovered . 'T was easy for him to have taken him up before he did ; for after he came from France , he appeared as publickly as any Man in the World . I have seen him at Randall 's Coffee-House , and at the Royal Exchange , Fleet-Street , and all Parts of the Town . Prisoner . Ask him whether Mrs Cannon did not come into the Room , at the Time he was shewing him this Draught ? and telling him it was my Hand-writing . Lawn . I think that was the Thing that stopped our Discourse . I ca n't remember particularly , whether she came into the Room ; but when the Door was open , she might hear every Word we spoke . I think I saw her , and that that hush 'd our Discourse . I am a Marshalsea-Court Officer , and have been so these thirteen or fourteen Years . Constantine Matthews . I was with Mark Lawn at Cannon 's House , the Day the Prisoner was bailed ; when Cannon came down Stairs , he said , he had bailed the Prisoner , and he brought down the Note , and said it was his Hand-writing ; and he took a Letter out of his Pocket , and compared it with the Note . I did not know the Prisoner 's Hand-writing , nor did Cannon say on what Account the Note was given him . Mrs Cannon was passing to and fro , at the same Time ; and she came into the Room , when he was comparing the Note with the Letter , upon which he put it aside , and when she was gone she compared them again . Mr Lawn compared them together likewise , and said he knew it was his Hand-writing , upon comparing the Names together . Couns . Did he say the Names , or the Body of the Note was the Prisoner 's Writing ? Matthews . I do not know what a Note is ; but he compared the Hand-writings together , and said they were the same . I am Lawn 's Assistant , and have been at Cannon 's many Times . John Cogland . I used to go to Cannon 's House to drink a Glass of Wine , and about 18 Months ago , I heard him say there was a Draught of 12 l. 10 s. and he was sorry he had presented it , for fear it should hurt the Prisoner . There was an Intimacy between the Prisoner and Cannon after he had presented ; and he said he believed it was not the Prisoner 's Intention to defraud any body by it ; but I am not positive to that . Robert Fitzgerald . I know the Prisoner ; and have seen Cannon once or twice : This Note was given him about 18 Months ago , but I have seen him and the Prisoner in Company together after that . Fitzgerald the Prisoner owing me 6 Guineas upon a Note , I got him arrested , and my Attorney told me , he had put in Bail . A fortnight afterwards the Attorney told me , that unless the Prisoner surrender 'd , the Bail would be fix 'd for the Money . About a fortnight after this , the Prisoner call 'd at my House , and proposed to pay me 5 Guineas : I went with him to a Tavern , and there I saw Mr Masters , a Wine Merchant , and Mr Cannon , and I received 5 Guineas , 4 of which , Cannon gave to the Prisoner , and he ( the Prisoner ) adding one to it , gave it me , and he was to pay the Attorney ; at the same Time , Cannon returned a Silver-hilted Sword to the Prisoner , and the Bail was discharged , upon the Prisoner 's giving me a Note for the remaining Guinea . Mr Masters told me , the Prisoner had made a fine Jobb of it ; for in order to get Bail to my Action , he had forg 'd Mr Lutterel 's Name to a Draught upon the Bankers . Why , says I , what was the four Guineas and the Sword for ? The Prisoner said , he gave him them to induce him to be Bail for him ; and Cannon was by , and seem 'd to own it : But he made some Difficulty in giving back the 4 Guineas , because the Prisoner owed him 35 s. for Wine , and Reckonings unpaid . I asked the Prisoner , how he could do so imprudent an Act , as to sign a Man 's Name to a Note ? He told me he did it , to let Cannon see he did not want Money ; for he intended to make up the 4 Guineas , which he had given Cannon , 6 , and to have paid me . But Cannon 's calling at the Bankers with the Note , had discovered it to be bad . I never saw the Prisoner from that Time to this , 'till the Affair at the late Masquerade , and then I happened to dine with Mr Lutterel , and heard he was about prosecuting him for this Draught . Couns . Did Cannon hear the Prisoner say he had deposited 4 Guineas with him , to induce him to be Bail ? Mr Fitzgerald . Yes , and Cannon own 'd it ; and with Relation to the 30 s. which Cannon would have stopp 'd , the Prisoner told him , he need not talk so much about 30 s , for his Reckonings , for he had made his Wife a Present of Something , of much greater Value . I thought it was an odd Way of reproaching Cannon with his own Gallantries , but I was very glad to get my 5 Guineas . I have heard the Prisoner 's Defence , and that he says he gave Cannon this Note to pacify his Wife ; but I heard nothing of such a Pretence then . I asked the Prisoner what need he had to give him a Note , when he had left 4 Guineas and his Sword with him ? He told me , he did it because I would not have him think he was under any Obligation to him . I understood that the Prisoner drew this Note before Cannon 's Face , and I told Cannon , he was a Fool to take a Note wrote before his Face . Mr Masters said something , that Cannon was a Blockhead , but I do not know whether Cannon was in the Room when this was said . I was there about 10 Minutes , or much about that Space of Time ; and the Prisoner then insinuated as if Cannon had seen him draw the Note . I have seen Cannon once , since that Time , at Mr Lutterel 's , and it was the Day after the Masquerade . He insisted upon it that the Prisoner took it out of his Pocket ready drawn , and if he has sworn so now , I do not doubt but it is true . Mr James Barret deposed , that he knew the Prisoner ; and that at Mr George Fitzgerald 's Request , he gave him , in October , a Letter of Recommendation to a Friend of his at Dunkirk , that he might be assisted in the Recovery of a Debt ; that a Month or two afterwards , he saw the Prisoner upon Change , and had frequently seen him since he returned from France , but the Witness had no Acquaintance with him . The Witness was asked if the Debts he went over to recover were not one Nelson a Jeweller 's ? He answered , - he could not tell . J - H - deposed , he had known the Prisoner 6 or 7 , or 5 Years to be sure ; that he lived a Servant with a Neighbour of his , and his Master when he came away gave him a good Character . Since which , he had bought Goods of him ; he had given him Credit , and the Prisoner had paid him . He was asked if he had not suspected his having taken some of his Goods , and he answered , there was a Person said something to him about a Piece of Cambrick , but the witness was convinced there was nothing in it . James Leony had known him about 4 or 5 Months , and had been in his Company several times , but knew nothing of his General Character . G - B - had known him 7 or 8 Years ; he had had Transactions with him , and never met with any Fraud . The Witness had seen him at his House , but never had any Conversation with him at Taverns , or Publick Houses . He believed he had been a visible Man for 7 or 8 Months last past . He added , that he knew the Prisoner before he went to France ; he knew not what Business called him there ; but while he was there he transacted some Affairs for him relating to one Nelson , and the Witness sent him a Bill of 20 l. for his Trouble . He could not remember whether the Prisoner appeared publickly before he went to France . Hen . Bostock had know him some Years , and he was surprized the Prisoner should subpoena him in his Behalf , when he could speak nothing in his Praise . He deposed , that the Prisoner 's General Character for 5 or 6 Years past , was such , that he should be ashamed to claim him for an Acquaintance . He understood him in general , to have an idle contemptible Character ; he knew nothing wicked of him himself . James Cogland had known the Prisoner about 6 years , and never till now heard of his being dishonest . Joseph Simmonds had known him 8 Years , he never heard any thing ill of him , except that he was addicted to Gaming . Alex Montgomery had know him since 1728 . He used the Witness 's House , and they had had Dealings together . He never knew any thing amiss of him , but heard he was under Misfortunes , about the Year 1738 , and that he then went abroad ; after which he returned and was frequently at the Witness 's House , and was visible within 8 or 10 Months last past . - Burges had known him about a Year , in which time he never heard any great Harm of him , till this time . His first Acquaintance with him was in France . Edward Fitzgerald , Mr Lutterel 's Book-keeper , deposed , that the Prisoner and his Master were acquainted , but had no Dealings together , as he knew of ; except that sometimes Mr Lutterel used to give him a Draught on Messrs. Knight and Shuttleworth , for Money due to Mrs Rookes , who received an Annuity of 50 l. per Annum from Mr Lutterel . He added , that sometimes the Prisoner came for the Money ; sometimes Mrs Rookes ; and that Mrs Rookes and the Prisoner kept Company together , but he did not take them to be Man and Wife . He farther said , that he delivered 2 or 3 of Mr Lutterel 's Checques to the Prisoner , because he told the Witness he wanted to go to the Play , and he gave him these , that he might write upon them , to the Box-keeper , in order to get Admission for himself , or his Friends . Rob Fitzgerald deposed that upon the Prisoner 's Application to him to give him a Character , he sent him Word , that he could not do it . He swore his Character was very indifferent , and that ever since he had quitted Business for a Pleasureable Life , he had been a Gamester . He added , that he had heard of twenty bad Actions of the Prisoner 's ; such as he should have been ashamed of . Another Gentleman deposed that he never had had any Acquaintance with the Prisoner ; but he had heard him called a Gamester and Sharper . The Jury Acquitted him . 262 . + Rose Smith was indicted for stealing Lace , val . 5 l. the Goods of Dame Elizabeth Clark , Widow , in her Shop , April 15 . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation .

Piece , May 9 . Percival . On the 9th of May , I brought a Mare to Town , which I carried to Smithfield , and sold to one Mr Whitesides , at the Bear and Ragged Staff , for 7 l. 7 s. and a Horse to boot . He gave me 2 36 s. Pieces , a Moidore , and a Guinea and Half , and 16 s. and 6 d. in Silver . The Gold I put in one Pocket , and the Silver in another . Then I went to see a Friend in St John Street , and as I was going from thence , to the White Horse Inn , in Fleet-Street , I met a Man , about 6 in the Evening , in a narrow Passage , ( White Horse Alley , I think 't is called ) and he seem 'd to be drunk , and endeavoured to stop me . At the same Time a Woman came up in a black Hat , like a Country-woman , and clapp 'd me on the Shoulder , and said she must speak with me . I told her I did not know her , and just as I was speaking these Words , the Prisoner came up , and without speaking a Word , thrust her Hand in my Pocket : I clapped my Hand upon my Pocket , but yet I saw her draw out 2 Pieces of Gold with her 2 Fingers , a Moidore , and a 36 s. Piece , I immediately felt in my Pocket , and missed 2 Pieces out of the 5 . The Prisoner upon my Oath is the Person . After she had robbed me , she made the best of her Way into a House , about 30 Yards off , and the Door was fastened after her . I knock 'd , but nobody would hear ; at last some People opened a Window above Stairs , and called Harry , Jack , Tom , and raised a hundred People about me ; and some of them bid me get away , for they were all Thieves , and if I had any more Money left , they would have it all . After this a Woman came by , who said she would help me to secure them , and I went with her to St Luke 's Head , and sent for the Watch : A Watchman went in Pursuit of them ; and about 10 o'Clock we were sent for to the Watch-house , where I saw the Prisoner , and gave the Constable Charge of her . He secur 'd her that Night , and next Morning she was carried before Justice Poulson , where she was searched , and a 36 s. Piece dropping out of one of her Stockings , she owned it was my Money , but said the other Woman robbed me , and gave her this Piece . Mr Whitesides confirmed Mr Percival , in his Account of the Money he received , and said he believed , and could almost swear to the Piece , which was found on the Prisoner , while he was with her before the Justice ; because there was a black Spot upon it , which he had before observed . He gave the same Account of the Prisoner 's Confession . Philip Price the Watchman , and Samuel Davis , the Constable 's Evidence were agreeable to the foregoing ; the Constable added , that the Prisoner told him , She must , and would be made an Evidence . Guilty Felony only . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 274 , 275 . + Ann Smith , and Mary Burn of St Martin 's in the Fields , were indicted ( with Margaret Eastmead , John Eastmead , George Elliot , and Alice his Wife , not taken ) Ann Smith for assaulting George Hawkins , and giving him , with both her Hands on his Head , Neck , Breast , Back , Belly , and Sides , several mortal Bruises , of which he instantly died . And the Indictment charged Burn , and the others , with aiding and assisting the said Smith , in the Commission of the said Murder , March 28 . Elizabeth Manning , a Waiter at Eastmead 's * Bagnio in Leicester Fields , deposed , that she never saw the Prisoner Burn , in her Life , and all that she had to say , with Regard to Smith , was , that 6 or 7 Weeks ago , about 10 in the Morning , she heard her say at Eastmead 's , that she was the unfortunate , or unhappy , Woman , who brought the Man into Eastmead 's House . * See the Sessions Book for July , No . 390 . And that for March , No . 159. Frances Fowler deposed that Nan Smith , came into Eastmead 's House the Evening after the Man was kill 'd , and said , O that I should be the unfortunate Means of bringing the Man into the House , to be the Death of him ! James Chamberlen swore he heard Nan Smith say she carried the Coachman ( the Deceased ) into the House , and staid a considerable time with him , then left him fast asleep , and very much in Liquor . There appeared no Evidence of any kind against Burn , and this being all that was given against Smith , they were both Acquitted . 276.

April 26 . F - . On Friday April 25 , I had been in the Country , and came to Town about 9 o'clock , but I staid in Leicester Fields till after 12 . I live in the Strand , and as I was coming along the Strand , those Ladies met me , and I being a little warm in Liquor , they both took hold of me , and said , I should give them a Pint of Wine : I being a little merry , went with them , to a private House in Benner 's Court , over against the Fountain Tavern in the Strand , and gave them a Pint ; but seeing what they were , and what House I had got into , I threw down a Shilling , and was going away : But the Prisoners , and another Woman , came up to me , and I was in danger of my Life in the House . They told me , that I had Six Shillings more to pay , so I threw down 6 s. upon the Table , and they took it up among them ; for if they had demanded a Guinea , I should have given it them , because of the Danger I was in . Then I went to the Door , and the Man of the House came up , and looking at me , he cry 'd , - Why you have 4 s. more to pay ! Pray let me go out , says I , and I 'll give it you , and pray go home with me ; for I was not far from my own House . Upon this he let me out , and followed me ; presently I heard the Women say , - d - mn him there he is . Seeing no Watchman near , I thought my self in Danger , and went to the Watch-house in Strand-Lane , but missing the Door , the two Prisoners came up and caught me ( on each side ) by the Collar , and the Man fell to beating me on the Stomach at the same time . I called out Murder as long as I could speak , and the Man hearing somebody coming up , gave me a Slap on the Face , and said , d - mn you , take that , and one of the Women cry 'd , - take what you can get ; so some of them took my Hat and Whip , which were given to the Man , and he ran away with them . I am positive to the Prisoners ; for Pooley I held till the Watch came to my Assistance , and the other I described so well , that she was taken next Morning , when she came to bring Pooley a clean Gown . I could distinguish their Faces very well by the Moonlight , and positively swear to them both . Thomas Edlin a Constable , swore he found Pooley , and the Prosecutor , between 12 and 1 , struggling together in Strand Lane , they charged him with each other , and he kept them both , tho ' he knew the Prosecutor to be a sufficient House-keeper . He charged her with robbing him of a Hat and Whip , and found her in 20 different Stories . The Witness said , that the Prosecutor gave the same Account of the Robbery , that he had now done ; and that he had promised to pay the Man the last Demand which was made on him , in the House the Prisoners carried him to , if he would go home with him : But afterwards , not thinking it proper to carry the Man home , he intended to have gone with him to the Watch-house , but missed the Door : He added , that Pooley 's Apron was bloody , when she was taken , and that Miller was apprehended next Morning , when she came to bring the other a Gown . John Higgins deposed , that about 3 Weeks ago , between 12 and 1 o'clock in the Morning , he was wak 'd by a Cry of Murder ; that the Noise growing fainter and fainter , he got up , and looked out of the Window , and heard somebody a cursing and swearing , and a Woman , ( as he judg 'd by the Voice ) say , d - n it , push off , or go off ; and at the same Time he heard the Words . - Hat , - and he thought - Wigg ; and saw a Man running up the Lane after a Woman ; and the Man took something out of her Hand . He likewise heard a Woman swear , she would go back , and rescue , or relieve her ; after which , he saw a Woman coming down the Lane , who ran away upon the Appearance of the Watch . James Britles , a private Watchman , heard the Cry of Murder , and coming up saw a Man and two Women , ( one of which was Pooley ) with the Prosecutor , who charged him with Pooley , and she charged the Watchman with the Prosecutor . Upon this , he went to call the Watch , ; but when he returned , the Man and the other Woman was gone . He added , that he took Notice the Prosecutor had his Hat on , and his Whip in his Hand , when he left him ; but when he returned , and found him alone with Pooley , they were gone . He swore to Pooley , but not to Miller . James Williams , and John Gerrard ( for the Prisoners ) deposed , that they had been drinking in the City , and coming home between 12 and 1 o'Clock , they heard a Noise , and going to see what was the Matter , they saw Pooley without her Cap ; she had hold of the Prosecutor , and he had hold of her : that a Man coming from the Water-side , asked the Prosecutor how he could use the Prisoner in that Manner ? upon which he replied , - You Rascal , are you one of her Bullies ? That the Prosecutor and the Man , went to fighting , and the Witnesses then left them . Catherine Wheeler , Judith Cross , Elizabeth Wilks , and Mary Plummer , gave Pooley a good Character . Both acquitted . 283. Robert Briggs Gent . was indicted for feloniously marrying Martha Prick , Spinster ; his former Wife , Mary Hollage , being alive . It appeared from the Evidence , that the Prisoner married his first Wife at Wishich , in the Isle of Ely , about 9 Years ago . That he had debauched her , and she being pregnant , the Prisoner was took into Custody , by the Parish Officers , on that Account ; and that he afterward consented to marry her . It farther appear 'd that he had deluded the Person who was his second Wife , and had married her at the Fleet , on the 14th of February last . Both Marriages being proved to the Satisfaction of the Jury , and the former Wife being alive , the Prisoner was found Guilty . [ Branding .
