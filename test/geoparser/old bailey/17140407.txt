He said upon his Trial , That Turner had given him the Boots to make up , and that he pawn 'd 'em to buy Wax and Thread ; and that he was to give 2 s. for the Breeches ; and as to the Tools , 't was customary for 'em to use one another 's .

See summary . ] John Clap , of the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was Indicted for breaking into the Chamber of James Steward on the 3d instant , and taking thence 3 Perukes . The Prosecutor swore ; That being at Work in his Chamber , the Prisoner broke in upon him under pretence of arresting him for 6 s. 8 d. and at the same time his Wigs were taken away . The Prisoner produc 'd a Writ in Court to arrest the Prosecutor , and brought Witness that he open 'd the Door himself , and then he thrust in his Arm , and and arrested him . Another Witness who went along with him , swore there was no Wig in the Room . The matter appearing plain in the Prisoner 's behalf he was acquitted . Mary Gill , of the Parish of St. Andrew Holborn , was Indicted for stealing a Feather Bolster and Pillow , a pair of Sheets , a pair of Blankets , and a Holland Pillowber , the Goods of John Willington , on the 30th of November last . The Prosecutor 's Wife swore she let the Prisoner and her Husband a Room furnish 'd , and they lay there 3 Weeks , and then took the Goods , which the Prisoner own 'd when she was taken , and told where they were . But her Husband taking the Room , and lodging there with her , she was acquitted . Sophia Cook , was Indicted for Counterfeiting the current Coyn of this Kingdom . But no Prosecution appearing against her , she was acquitted . Christopher Plunket , Esq ; of the Parish of St. Dunstan in the West , was Indicted for the Murder of Robert Moor , Gent on the 23d of February last , by giving him a Mortal Wound on the left side of the Body near the Groin , of the breath of half an inch , and the depth of two inches , of which he languished till the first day of March , and then dy 'd . It appear 'd by the Evidence , That Mr. Moor came to the Bar at the Horn and Horse shoe Tavern in Chancery-Lane , and enquir 'd for one Mr. O Hara , who being there in Company with Mr. Plunket and several other Gentlemen , Mr. Moor went in , and Saluted the Company all round after a very friendly manner , but refus 'd to sit down , or to drink , having drank very plentifully before . After mutual Salutations , he took Mr. Plunket aside , where they talk 'd together a while , and then went out , and were gone sometime before the Company miss 'd them , and concluded they were gone to Bed , it being past One of the Clock in the Morning ; but some time after the Prisoner came in , and brought the Deceas 'd Sword and Cane along with him , telling them he was afraid Mr. Moor was hurt . Bass , the Beadle of that part of the Parish , swore , That the Deceas 'd call 'd to him as he went along , and when he came to him , he found him bleeding very much , and led him home ; and asking him how he came in that Condition , he told him 't was an old Grudge , but would not say who did it . When he came to his Lodging , the Maid asking him where his Sword was , he said in Bream 's Buildings , and told her likewise that one who ow 'd him an old Grudge had paid him , but did not say who . Another Evidence depos 'd , That the Deceas 'd said he was barbarously us 'd , the Prisoners Sword being in his Body before he was upon his Guard , his Cane hanging upon his Wrist at the same time . [ Here the Beadle was call 'd up again , and being ask 'd whether it was light enough for one Man to see what another did at some distance , could not say it was . ] Mr. Adrian Moor depos 'd , That the day before he dy 'd , the Deceas 'd told him Mr. Plunket had done it ; and Mr. Humphreys swore , That being at a Coffee house in the City , he saw the Prisoner ; and asking him if he had heard of Mr. Moor 's Misfortune of being wounded , he said Yes , and I am the Unfortunate Man that did it . By which Evidence it plainly appear 'd the Prisoner did kill the Deceas 'd . To prove it to be a premeditated Quarrel , some Witnesses appear 'd , who swore that they fell out and fought together about 20 Months ago at the Swan Ale-house in the Butcher-row , and the Prisoner 's Sword being broke , they parted ; and others declar 'd that Mr. Moor had divers times us 'd very hard words against the Prisoner . Mr. Plunket , in his Defence , own 'd that he had such a Skirmish with the Deceas 'd , but that all was over , and reconcil 'd long ago ; to prove which , he brought several Witnesses , who declar 'd that since that , and even a day or two before their last unhappy meeting , they had been extraordinary friendly , and us 'd the most endearing expressions that could be to each other , and that the Prisoner had help 'd the Deceas 'd into several Causes , and once particularly favour 'd him in the Court of Chancery , when by mistake he had made himself liable to a Penalty . As to the Crime for which he was indicted , he said . That the Deceas 'd calling him out of the Tavern , they walk 'd up Chancery-Lane together ( he being in his way home ) and the Deceas 'd began to talk of a Bill of Costs to be paid by Sir John Talbot in a Cause wherein he ( the Prisoner ) was concern 'd , by which he fell into such a Passion , that he first struck him on the Head with his Cane , and afterwards drew his Sword ; whereupon he drew his , and in parrying the Deceas 'd got , his Wound ; which was strengthen 'd by a Witness who swore the Deceas 'd , a little before he dy 'd told him it was his own fault . He further prov 'd , That as soon as he heard Mr. Moor was dead , he surrender 'd himself to Mr. Justice Le Neve , and that he had never absconded from his Lodging during the whole time of his Illness . He also had a great many Persons of Distinction , who gave him the Character of a peaceable Man , and one readier to appease , than create Quarrels ; and the Court summing up the Evidence in a very impartial and judicious Manner , the Jury brought him in Guilty of Manslaughter .
