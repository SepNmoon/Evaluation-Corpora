See summary . ] Elizabeth Symbole , of the Parish of St. Anns Westminster , together with her Two Sisters , were all Indicted , First , For that they , together with Jacob Reginer , not taken , did kill and murder one Isaac Symbole , late Husband of the said Elizabeth Symbole . Secondly , For being present , aiding and abetting the said Jacob Reginer , in the stabbing of the said Symbole , he having no Weapon drawn , nor having first struck him . The Indictment set forth , That they , together with the said Jacob Reginer , not having the Fear of God before their Eyes , but being Instigated by the Devil , the 30th of January last past , In and upon the said Isaac Symbole they did make an Assault , and the said Jacob Reginer , with a Rapier which he had in his Right Hand drawn , did give to the said Isaac Symbole One Mortal Wound near to the Right Pap of the Breadth of one Inch , and of the Depth of Six Inches , of which he Instantly died , & c. The Councel for the King , first opened the Nature of both the Indictments to the Gentlemen of the Jury , shewing how malicious a Fact , and what a Barbarous Murder the Prisoners at the Bar stood charged with ; it being the more aggravated , because the Relation and Affinity was so Conjugal as the Wife to the Husband , therefore it was no less than Petty-Treason in her , as well as Felony and Murder : Therefore it was a Crime of a very High Nature in them all , if so be that they should be found guilty of it ; and it required their serious and mature Consideration . Then the Witnesses for the King were called and sworn ; the first was one Jane Williams , Mr. Symbole 's Servant , who deposed , That on the 30th day of January last , Mr. Reginer , and Mrs. Symbole 's two Sisters , viz . the other two Prisoners , came to Mr. Symbole 's House in the Afternoon , and found Mrs. Symbole in the Kitchen ; so she ordered her to make a Fire in the Parlor , which she did , and then they went to Cards . Mr. Reginer had brought some Wine with him , which they drank , and were merry . Then Mrs. Symbole sent the said Williams for her master to one Mr. Lamberts , but he did not come home till [ Text unreadable in original . ] of the clock at night ; when he came in , a Supper was ordered , which they eat together , seeming to be good Friends ; and after Supper they went to Cards again , playing at a Game called Bone Ace , at a Farthing Bone , and a Farthing Ace . Then she went down Stairs , and there fell asleep ; afterwards awakening , hearing the Watchman knockt at the door , she went up stairs , where she found Mr. Reginer standing in the Room with a Naked Sword in his hand , all bloody , which he wiped his Coat ; and her master she found sunk down in his Chair behind the table , with one Leg upon the Chair . She going towards him , he put his hand out to her , and made as if he would speak , but could not , and immediately died . In the mean time the said Reginer got away , as also the two Sisters , her mistress Symbole being only left , who seemed to be in a great Agony ; then she run down stairs , and called one Stoneman , and one Springback , that were Neighbours , who came immediately , and lifted up Mr. Symbole from the ground , and perceiving his Lips to move , they got Strong-waters , and poured into his mouth , but to no effect ; for he instantly died . Stoneman and Springback deposed the same . A Watchman being sworn , declared that he was at the Door but about a quarter of an hour before the murder was done , and knockt at it , but some Woman answer 'd him out at the Window , saying , All was well . There was other confirming Proofs how , and in what manner Mr. Symbole was found , and that Mrs. Symbole was much troubled , crying out , She was undone . Being asked , Who it was that murder 'd her Husband ? She would give no account at first , only said it was a Lawyer belonging to the Temple ; at length when more people came in , she told them his Name was Reginer . It was further deposed , that Mrs. Symbole nor the other two did not offer to stop the said Reginer , but suffer 'd him to go away . The Surgeon gave in Evidence , that upon search of the Body of the deceased , he found no less than 18 Wounds about him , five of which were mortal ; that they were all made with one and the same Sword as he believed ; and that there was a Bruise under his ear , which was perhaps done by his Fall off his Chair , for one of the Searchers ( an old Woman ) swore that she thought that was done by a fall , for it could not be blacker , except he had died at the Tree , as she call 'd it ; she knew it very well , she said , by experience , for that she had been an old Stripper . This was the sum of the Evidence for the King against the Prisoners , & c. Then they were all call 'd upon to make their Defence ; and Mrs. Symbole first began , who said , That she was wholly Innocent of the Murder , and declared the whole matter , how that Mr. Reginer , and her Sisters came to her House whilst Mr. Symbole was abroad , and brought some Wine , and that she sent to look for Mr. Symbole to come home and bear them Company , so they went to Cards ; and about Nine or Ten a Clock at night Mr. Symbole came home , and was in a very good Humour , very kindly embracing Mr. Reginer , telling him that he had highly honoured him with his Company , and complemented him very civilly ; after which , a Supper was provided ( by Mr. Symbole 's Order ) which they eat very amicably together ; after which they played at Cards again , at Bone Ace , and Mr. Symbole and Mr. Reginer , happening to turn up two Sevens each of them ; Mr. Symbole said , That the Cards should be dealt again , which Mr. Reginer denied , upon which high Words arose : Mr. Symbole telling Reginer , That he had been in the Crown-Office . Reginer replying , That he never was in the Pillory ; so to boxing they went , and Mr. Reginer drew his Sword and stabbed Mr. Symbole . She further declared , That she was so much affrighted , that she knew not what she did , and that she screamed out as loud as she was able ; but the Old Woman being asleep in the Kitchen , could not make her hear , besides , she called a whole Cloud of Witnesses to prove that her Husband and she had always lived very lovingly together , and that Mr. Symbole had been often times heard to speak very respectively of his Wife , and loved her very well ; besides , she had divers very credible Persons , who appeared in Court , and gave an Excellent Testimony of Mrs. Symbole 's Reputation ; and that she had been always bred very Religiously , and had a very modest Carriage and Behaviour , not guilty of any manner of [ Text unreadable in original . ] or Disregard in the Comporting of herself towards Mr. Symbole , never since she was his Wife , and being much surprised she knew not how Mr. Reginer got out of the House , it being supposed that her Sisters had gone out before him , and [ Text unreadable in original . ] ; so he got away before any Assistance came . One Sister in her defence , alledged , That she was there the same night the Murder was Committed , and that Mr. Symbole and Mr. Reginer were good friends , till they fell out about turning up two Sevens ; and that she being so much affrighted when she saw them fight , she ran down Stairs and went home crying out and making a noise , but did not know what she did , only she remembered that in the Quarrel , Mr. Symbole called Mr. Reginer Cowardly Rogue , and told him , That he had been in the Crown Office . Then Mr. Reginer replied , that he never was so great a Rogue as to stand in the Pillory . The other Sister declared to the same effect , as did the former , That she was also much affrighted , and her Sister going away in the time of the Quarrel , she went also ; but as to the designing any Murder , she knew not . They had both the same Evidence as to their Reputation , as had Mrs. Symbole . So , then all the Witnesses having been examined fairly on both sides , with a great deal of patience and Indulgence from the Court , for their Trial lasted very long ; the Court gave the Charge to the Gentlemen of the Jury , distinguishing the Law in the Case of Murder ; and because , where any Person shall stab another , other People being by , and not interrupting him yet he only is guilty of the Stabbing and Death of the man , because he gave the thrust ; so this Evidence did not affect the Prisoners upon the Statute of Stabbing , so they were all acquitted of the Penalty of that Statute ; and there being no positive Proof that they did Abet , Aid , or Assist the said Reginer in the Perpetration of so Barbarous and Bloody a Murder , or had any hand in the same , the Jury brought a Verdict that they were all not guilty of it . Sarah Becket , was Tryed for Robbing the House of her Mistress , one Lydia Campion of St. Andrews Holborn ; on the 4th of January last , and carrying away a silver Cann value 50s . a Salt 10s . two Silver Porringers 4l . 20 Ounces of silver 5l . with other Plate of great value ; Mistress Campion swore that she was brought to her , to be her Servant , the 4th of January last , and the same night , she went away with the Plate , which was found upon her in the street by some Boys , and a Mobb that gathered about her , who brought her back to Mistress Campions , with the Plate also ; she had been an old Offender before , she had no defence that was material , she was found guilty of the Felony .

Mr. Bates Sister swore , That the Prisoner and Tuttle came to her Brother ; and he told the Court , that Tuttle would have perswaded him to lay the Buggery upon Mr. Hall , and if he would do it , then he should be provided for as long as he lived , & c. But Bates refused it ; and could not say , That Mr. Lane spake any thing to him . The Prisoner called some Witnesses to prove his Reputation , who all said , That he been bred well , and served an Apprenticeship to a Wier-drawer , and that he never was given to do any evil thing ; and that if he had done amiss now , it was the first Fact , or words to the same effect in favour of him ; yet for all this , his Innocency was not cleared . For says the Court , What business had Mr. Lane with Mr. Hall , along with Tuttle ; Was it to advise him about the Charge and Conspiracy , how to defend himself ? Surely no , for he was altogether a Stranger to him ; therefore it must be conjectured that he went along with Tuttle out of a sheer design to get money out of Mr. Hall . And the Gentlemen of the Jury were to consider of the business of the Fact , that men should be so impudent to impose upon a Citizen , and so worthy a Merchant , as Mr. Hall was . So that in the end the Prisoner was found guilty of a Misdemeanor in conspiring against the said Mr. Hall , and for charging him with so great a Falshood . [ Fine . See summary . ] [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour . See summary . ] William Cannock , Gent . was tried for the Murther of Thomas China , Gent . by giving him a mortal wound with a Rapier , val . 2 s. 6 d. upon the left Thigh , near to his Groin , of the breadth of one Inch , and of the depth of three Inches , of which he instantly dyed ; the Evidence was , first , two Watchmen who said , that they found the Prisoner and the deceased standing in Arundel street with their Swords drawn about three a clock in the Morning , and when they came up to them , they put up their Swords , and walking together a little way , Mr. China fell down dead ; the next Witness was the Gentleman that kept the Rummer Tavern near Arundel street , who said that they , with another Gentleman , were drinking Wine at his house till Two a Clock in the Morning the same Night , and were very merry and civil ; another Witness a Coffee-Woman , who lived in Milford lane , declared , that they were both in her house the same night , and there they quarrelled about Fighting in Flanders ; and China called Cannock a Villain and Rascal , and spit in his face and told him , That if he would not come out and fight he would kick him . Mr. Cor [ Text unreadable in original . ] gave account , That the wound was above Three Inches deep , which was near his Groin , and was Mortal . The Prisoner in his defence called one Mr. Isaacson to be a Witness for him , who declared the whole matter from [ Text unreadable in original . ] to what before has been sworn . He further [ Text unreadable in original . ] did own that Mr. China did dye by his by his hand , for which he was very sorry , but what he did he was forced to do in his own defence , because Mr. China prest so hard upon him . [ Text unreadable in original . ] was found Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] Jane [ Text unreadable in original . ] was tried for High-Treason in Clipping of Currant Coin of this Kingdom . She was taken in the Liberty of St. Katherines , on the 11th of February last . The Evidence swore , That they went to search her house for stolen goods [ Text unreadable in original . ] there was found about her a small parcel of Clippings , and her Bed were found some shears and files . She declared in her defence , That she did not know how the Clippings came there , and called several of her Neighbours , who justified her Reputation , and that her Husband was a very loose idle Person . So in the conclusion she was acquitted . Ann Banks , alias Wilson , was tried for robbing William Martyn of St. Andrews Parish ( on the First instant ) of 8 pair of Sleeves , val 5l . 9 pair of Flaxen Pillowbers 18s . some Hoods , and divers other Goods . But the Evidence was not sufficient to find her Guilty , so she was acquitted . Mary Sudcole , a Maiden , was tried for stealing two Muslin Nightroyls , val 2s . the Goods of Phyamete Cotes . The Evidence could not charge her fully , and she had good Evidence that she was an honest maid . So she was acquitted . Matthew Coppinger was tried for entring the house of Mary Mottershed in the day-time , and putting her in Fear , taking away a Watch value 7l . and 7l . in money . Mrs. Mottershed swore , that the Prisoner came to her House with another man , one B - and told her that she was a Clipper , and would swear it , giving her threatening language , that she should burn as Fire burned . But before this , the Prisoner asked her to lend him some money , for that he was in Law ; but she refusing it , he caused her to open her Trunks , wherein was the Watch and the money . He pretended to search for Clippings and clipt money , but found none ; the Watch and the money lying upon the Bed , whilst Mrs. Mottershed went into another Room to dress herself ( to go to Newgate as she thought ) being in great terror , did not mind the Prisoners motions , upon a sudden the Prisoner , and the other man B - ( not yet taken ) went down stairs , and away they went with the Watch and money . The Prisoner alledged that he was maliciously prosecuted , and that Mrs. Mottershed went by several Names , viz . Tomson , Sturgess , and Mottershed , and that all her Neighbours knew her to be a Clipper ; but that was no such thing , for she was a person of known integrity . Then he offer d a warrant for his doing , signed by Hugh Chamberlain Esq ; Justice of the Peace of Middlesex ; but he had no Witness to prove that the Warrant was a true one granted by Mr. Justice Chamberlain . There was no proof that he broke anything , and Mrs. Mottershed having her Watch sent her from B - by a Porter , she paying four Guinea 's to fetch it out of pawn , the Prisoner was found guilty but of Felony . Matthew Coppinger was a 2d time tried for Felony and robbery . The Indictment set forth , that the Prisoner , together with one John Brandon , and Thomas Smith , did go to the house of one Humphrey Davis near Lincolns-Inn Fields , where was one Mrs. Elizabeth Powell , Wife of George Powell , and there did rob her of 30 Guinea 's ; the said Brandon having a Sword drawn in his right hand , did put Mrs. Powell in fear , and afterwards the Prisoner tells Mr. Powell that he had a kindness for him , therefore came to acquaint him that there was a Warrant of High-Treason against him and his Wife for Clipping , which would be sworn against him by own Rogues that he knew , & c. He was a third time arraigned for a misdemeanour , in conspiring against the said Mr. Powell and his Wife , for falsly charging them with the Crime of High-Treason , thereby to bring them to final death . The Evidence for the King first swore , that the Prisoner said he had been with the Parliament to get a Warrant or Order for to take up the Clippers , and Mr. Powell declared that the Prisoner came to him to his house , and told him that there were two men at a Coffee-house hard by , had a Warrant of High-Treason against him , and he knowing him to be his Friend , and a worthy Person , he came to let him know of it to secure himself ; so he and Coppinger went out to a Tavern , and just as they were entring in at the Door , comes Brandon and Smith up to him , and in a rude manner accosted him , telling him that they had a Warrant against him and his Wife for High-Treason ; and immediately seized him , and took him into the Tavern , and threatened him in a strange manner , with horrid Oaths and Execrations , that he and his wife were Clippers , and that he should be hang 'd , and his Wife burnt ; at which Mr. Powel was much surprised ; and they went and fetch 'd Mrs. Powel , and then removed from the Tavern to an Alehouse , where they said that they would swear it downright against them ; upon which Mrs. Powell was very much affrighted , and fell into a Swoon ; so Coppinger came to her , and bid her not to be troubled , pretending to be a Friend , and that it was nothing but a Trick , and that the two men were Rogues , and only wanted money ; so they at last compounded the matter , and took 30 Guineas , which Mrs. Powell had fetch 'd from home , unknown to her Husband ; so away they went . They came with a Warrant , but without any Constable ; and it appeared upon the whole matter , that the Prisoner Coppinger was privy to the whole Design , and joined with the said Brandon and Smyth in carrying on the Villany , and that he was at the Horse-Shoe Tavern in Drury-Lane just after they had received the money . Mr. Powel did not know the said Brandon nor Smith , nor had any great Acquaintance with Coppinger . Other Evidence proved that he had part of the Guineas to his Share : And that he made his humble Application to Mr. Powel ( by Letters ) , That if he would pardon him , and be so merciful to him as to make him an Evidence against the said Brandon and Smith , he would upon Oath discover the Design , for that the said Brandon nor Smith did ever know the said Mr. Powel . He could not urge any thing material in his Defence ; and the Court being very well satisfied of the Heinousness of the Fact , and of the Innocence of Mr. Powel and Madam Powel , being Persons of an unblemish 'd Reputation ; this therefore was duly considered by both Court and Jury ; So he was found Guilty of Felony and Robbery ; and the Misdemeanor died in course . [ Death . See summary . ] The Trials being over , the Court proceeded to give Sentence as followeth , viz . Burnt in the Hand , 17 . Thomas Nichols , Mary Goffe , Elinor Griffeth , Priscilla Hamar , Thomas Hitch , James Fleming , James Mersham , Errick Cornelius , Richard Jones , Mark Fenton , William Cannock , Elizabeth Jefforson , Elizabeth Barnes , Sarah Becket , Jane Browne , Elizabeth Belwood , Jane Newel . Received Sentence of Death , 3 . Robert Geerish , John Davis , Matthew Coppinger . James Pattison , formerly Convicted for Clipping , was called to his former Judgments . To be Whipt , 3 . Martha Free , Mary Foster , William Skale Thomas Lane was fined 40 Mark , and ordered to stand Three times in the Pillory , once near the Mitre Tavern in Fenchurchstreet- a second Time at the Royal Exchange , and a Third Time in Cheapside , on the usual days ; and to find good Sureties for his Quiet Behaviour for a Twelvemonth . Thomas Hitch , James Fleming , Errick Cornelius , and Richard Jones , took a Lifting Shilling in Court , and were entertain 'd into His Majesty 's Service An Indictment was brought against Owen Sullivan , Daniel Kane , alias Kalligan , for that they together with Thomas Dunning , Charles Macartey , Timothy Brenot , and others , did break the Savoy Prison , whereby several persons who were committed there for High Treason , made their Escape ; they were ordered to be Tried for the Offence next Sessions . The Humble Presentment of the Grand Jury of London , to the Lord Mayor , Judges , and Justices of this Honourable Court , on the 20th of February , 1694/5 . Whereas by sad Experience , the currant Coyn of this Kingdom is diminished , defaced , imbased , and counterfeited to less than one half of the due Intrinsick Value , to the Ruin of Trade , and great Dishonour of the Nation , which we find by Exchange abroad , and to our great Detriment at home , if not speedily prevented by some new Law , which shall punish Confederate Dispersers of Clipt money , and mercenary Exchangers of Broad money , as well as the Criminals taken in the Fact of Clipping , will have a great tendency to the inevitable Ruin of Trade , and Disturbance in the Kingdom , than can be retrieved . That we conceive there is a necessity of further Power to be given to Justices of the Peace , and other Magistrates for frequent Examination of Loose and Unsettled persons that have no Habitation nor Business , but live on Pilfering and Begging ; and upon Examination of such Persons so found and detected , that they be imployed in the Service of the Kingdom , as Soldiers , would prevent the unreasonable Imposition by Press-masters ; and the loose vicious Women , and Black-guard Boys be sent to the Plantations . That Salisbury-Court , White-Friers , and other pretended Priviledge places , are notorious for entertaining Lewd People , Clippers , and Highway-men , and sheltering such as Defraud their Creditors . That all Lotteries , except what be established by the Government , be supprest as publick Nusances to the Debauchery and Ruin of Youth and Servants . All which we humbly present fit to be recommended by this Honourable Court , to the Wisdom of this Parliament , that such Laws may be enacted to redress these Grievances .
