With the Tryal of one Stevens for Breaking open a House at Branford . LONDON , Printed in the Year , 1674 . News from the Sessions-House . AT the General Sessions of Oyer and Terminer , and Goal delivery , held for the County of Middlesex and Citty of London , upon Friday and Saturday , the 19. and 20. of February Instant . Were arraigned several Malefactors for Crimes of sundry Natures , inconsiderable , other the more remarkable were these that follow . The first was one Harker an Ostler at the Bell-Inn on Fish-street Hill who was arraigned upon two several Indictments , the one for the Felonious stealing of a Horse , the other for the taking away of Monyes to the value of fourscore Pounds and upwards , from one Mr. Sterling , a Gentleman that lay in the same Inn , it seemes upon the evidence , that this Gentleman overnight spoke to the said Hostler to get his Horse ready the next Morning for his journy ; which accordingly was done , and that Morning the Gentleman finding his Horse made ready , took his Portmante wherein was fourscore Pounds and upwards , and laid it on himself upon the Horse and fastned it , and then going back again upon some occasion into the House , at his return within a very little time , finds his horse and mony gone and the Ostler to boot , who had taken this opportunity of his absence to leap into the the Saddle and ride away with the booty ; the Gentleman being thus left in the Lurch , finds it to little purpose to pursue after him , but rests for a while as patient as the reflections of so great a loss and disappointment would suffer him , It happened the same day towards Evening that a friend of this Gentlemans being in Russel-street neare Drury-Lane , towards the Evening saw the aforesaid Hostler passing by , He was then diguised with a Periwig so that he was not easy to be known , however the Gentleman apprehended him and it proved the same person , and he Confessed before the justice upon his examination that it was he that rode away with the Gentlemans Horse , and mony , and being demanded what he had done with them , he acquainted them that he had hid the mony ( all but a little ) that he took out for present occasions in Cane-wood near Highgate , and there according to his directions going over to the place they found it the horse he had left at Holloway tying him to a Bush , in the High-way and upon inquiry in the Neighbourhood there they chanced to heare of him , and the Gentleman had him returned again allso Upon his tryal he confest that he had rod away with the Horse and mony , but desired the favour of the Court in respect that the Gentleman had his Horse and mony returned again , which matter being left to the Jury , they brough him upon the first indictment for stealing the horse not guilty , upon the second they found him that as for taking the mony ; notwithstanding the Court not being satisfied with their first Verdict , sent them out again to consider of it but they brought in the same again that he was not Guilty of Stealing the Horse , for that as they said they understood the Gentlemans Horse was delivered to him to hold while the Gentleman went in , which made a Lawful possession , and therefore could be no Felonius taking him away , but the Court seemed to be of another opinion . The fact was not more knavish then the next was Tragical , which was the tryal of that bloudy and inhumane Villaine , the Butcher that kild his Wife at Islington , the fact was apparently proved against him by divers witnesses to whom he confest it , and by examination taken before a Justice upon his apprehension neither indeed did he go about to deny it at his Tryal but rather seemed to justified it both by his words and carriage , for when the Court asked him if he did not find a remors and trouble in his spirit for what he had done , he repyled that it did not , and that his Wife might thank her self for what she suffered for that she urged him to it , upon the whole circumstance of the Evidence it appeared that this fellow had lived with this aforesaid wife for the space of near too Years , leaving her that time in the Country , and keeping himself in London , where he drove the Trade of a Butcher , of which profession he proved to be from first to last , about the Bowling-ally in Turnbal-street ; the Tuesday before the fact was done , the woman his wife , having been with him some days in town , and did by his order go back to the Town where she lived to fetch up some things that he wanted , and was to return again the Tuesday following , which she did and as soon as she came to Town , poor Soul , goes directly to her bloody minded Husband , who seeming all this while to be taking care for a settlement for her , was in the mean while rather studying to destroy her , for upon her arrival he acquaints her that he had taken a new Lodging at Islington where they were to lye that night , and thither she must go with him , which she did , following him along Hatton-Garding , to Clarkenwell and so to Islington , where taking his opportunity near the Gravel-pits , a place fit for his hellish purpose , he fell upon her , and in a Barbarous manner gave her several deadly wounds in her head and Breast with her own Pattin , of which wounds she was found dead the next Morning being Saturday , and the same day the Murtherer was also by the providence of the Divine justice found out and discoverd , as hath been formerly related to you in another account of this Targedy . There was also indicted a young man and a maid that had been lately Servants to a Gentleman whose house being not far out of Town , was lately broke open and Robed , whence they lost several pieces of plate , and other things of greater value , and these two persons being suspected to be the acters or at least accessaries to the robery , were now tryed upon it , the fact upon the tryal appeared to be thus , the Gentleman of the House was that night abroad , his Wife and maid lay in a roome up one pair of stairs with a little Child of the gentlemans , towards Morning early comes in three men into the roome in Vizards and a light with them , with Weapons , the one having an Hanger , another an Holbert , and the third a Pistol , in this formidable posture they came to her Bedside . There was also Tryed one Stevens for breaking open a House at Brandford which was the house where he usually Lodged ; his Landlady having laid up 30. pounds for to pay her Brewer he having some sight thereof longed for an oportunity ; whereby he might furnish himself with that Treasure , To accomplish which design , he on the next morning went forth and staid out all the day , and the best part of the Night ; then coming to the house and finding all things secure , he broke into the house , and took away the money , besides plate and the Rings : to the value of 60. pounds for which he was Tried , and Condemned to be hanged . The Confession of George Allin before several Ministers in Newgate . After the Ministers had prayed with him , they urged to know the reason why he killed his Wife , and the cause of his first leaving of her ; he replyed , that she had kept others Company ; and could not therefore live Contented , and therefore left her . Then afterwards , fell in Love with a Servant Maid that lived next door to his Masters , and that it was through her means that he killed her , for she had moved him several times to marry her , and he replyed , that he could not well do it ; by reason he had a Wife already ; desired to know whether she would have him knock her in the head ; she Answered , do what you will George . Furthermore he was asked whether he had made use of this Persons Body ; to this after long consideration ; Confessed that he had , and that it was through her means that he killed his Wife , and farther did confess in the hearing of several ; that he had but then parted with the Maid in one Field , and killed his Wife in the next . Then he and she coming face to face these things being laid to her charge she utterly denied , to which he replyed , that he had bought her a Ring , that cost him twenty eight shillings , which was all the Money that he could make shift for ; and that he did always give her all the money that he could shift for , and that he had not Money for to Marry her , to which she replied that she would find Money . He is become very penitent , and is seldome or never without his book in his hand Reading , and Praying to God to forgive him for all his former sins and Wickedness ; and more especially for this Crying sin of Murdering his own dear flesh and Blood , which hainous sinne Cryes to God for vengeance against him : He defaes all people to pray for him , ( especially Young people , ) desiring them to take example by him ; and his shameful death ; and to have a special care what Company they keep , and to beware of the Company of Evil Women which had been the Chief cause of this his shameful End .
