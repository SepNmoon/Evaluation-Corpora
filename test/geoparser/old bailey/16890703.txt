It was further declared , That the Prisoner lent the Libel to the Priest and the other Person : And that they were to return it back to the Master of the House where they were drinking , which they did in 2 or 3 days after ; whereby the Master of the House had an opportunity to read it over at large , and to get Pendergrass Apprehended . And further , The Libel was produced in Court , and proved to be the same that was read by the Prisoner to his Companions , as above said . The Prisoner said , That he did not know who writ the Paper , neither did he Publish it . The Cou- told him that must be left to the Jury . He said , he did not know that it was [ any Misdemeanor , nor could he remember that ever he read any such Paper to any Gentlemen whatsoever , and that if he had had any other Papers , he would not have prefe 'd so hard to have that again . There were several other Controversies past between the Court and the Prisoner , who behaved himself like a person Inspired with the true Spirit of Popery , all the time of the Tryal ; for which he received most seasonable Reprimands from the Court : And having nothing material to offer , Mr . Recorder proceeded to direct the Jury , which he did very Exquisitely , telling them , That the only thing they were to consider of was , whether the Prisoner did Publish the Libel , yes or no , which was proved to them by 2 Witnesses that he did it maliciously to do mischief , which they might be induced to believe , by the high Estimation he set on it , telling them withal , That the Crime was of a very deep die , and desired them to take notice how many such kind of pernicious Libels had been ( of late ) thrown up and down the streets . Putting them in mind of what dangerous Consequence the promoting of such Principles might prove to the Liberties and Properties of all True Englishmen , which if they did not endeavour to suppress , he would lay at their doors , & c. Then the Jury withdrew a little space , and returning , brought him in Guilty . [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour . See summary . ] [ Fine .
