Mr. Barker . On the 4th of Nov . I saw three Pieces of Goods which I believe to be mine , at Mr. Hook 's a Mercer in St. Martins le-Grand ; I desired to know how he came by them , and he inform 'd me he had them from Elliot , who had been his Neighbour . The next Morning I was sent for to the Baptist's-Head in Milk-street , where Elliot own 'd that he bought the Goods of the Prisoner . The Prisoner had serv 'd us as a Porter , and when he was taken , he confessed that he had robb 'd us of all the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment , and directed us to go to his House for the 20 Yards of Garlix , which we found accordingly . Mr. Ravenhill . I saw three Pieces , a black Callimancoe , a brown Stuff , and a wash 'd Garlix , at Mr. Hook 's , which I knew to be mine . The Prisoner acknowledg 'd the Fact , and told us where the Garlix might be found . Henry Hook . Elliot brought a Piece of blue Mantua to my House , and as he was a Neighbour I bought it of him ; he afterwards brought some Silver Ducape , and ask 'd me 4 s. a Yard for it , I then had a Suspicion of it , for I knew that most of the Trade gave more , but I bought that likewise , and then sent for the Person who makes these Goods , and by his Means I found out the Prosecutors : I desir 'd Elliot , that I might better fix the Thing , to bring me more Goods , he did so , and among them this Callimancoe , and the brown Stuff , which Mr. Barker believed to be his . When Elliot was asked about these Goods , he owned that he bought them of the Prisoner . Francis Elliot . I bought Goods of the Prisoner , paid him for them in my Ware-house , and afterwards sold them to Mr. Hook . I ca n't swear that these are the same , for they are not in the same Condition as when I saw them , but they are like what I bought of the Prisoner . Joseph Clarke . I bought some Goods of Elliot , and gave him a Market Price for them . He was a Neighbour , and bore a good Character , otherwise I should not have bought them . I ca n't tell what Business he follows , he keeps a sort of a Warehouse for Linnen I believe . Mr. Sawbridge . I was at the Baptist's-Head with the Prosecutors , Hook and Elliot ; the Prisoner was sent for , and acknowledg 'd that he had sold these Goods to Elliot , and that he had robb 'd his Master ever since 1739 .

William Collier . On the 19th of November about Eight at Night , as I was returning from Kingston Market , I was met between Brentford and Turnham-Green , by three Footpads ; I am positive the Prisoner is one of them . They took me off my Horse into a-Field , pick 'd my Pocket of my Money , and put a Groat into my Bag again . I ca n't say which in particular took my Money , for they were all together . When they had robb 'd me , I went a little Way on the Road to Richard Hall 's , to get Assistance to take them , and when we came back , they were in the Field , and fir 'd at me directly . The Prisoner attempted to get over a Hedge , and was taken with a cock 'd Pistol in his Hand ; he said he would yield , and that it was the first Fact , and that he should be hang 'd for turning his Coat . Prisoner . There were several Men in the Field , and I did not know but they might be Rogues ; so I cock 'd the Pistol in my own Defence . Richard Hall . The Prosecutor told me he had been robb 'd , so I charg 'd a couple of Guns , and I and my Man went to the Field where this Robbery had been committed . I saw three Men in the Field , and the Prosecutor was immediately wounded in the Neck by one of them . The Prisoner was taken as he was getting over a Hedge with a Pistol cock 'd in his Hand , his Coat turn 'd , and his Wig in his Pocket . We found a Bayonet , and two Hats in the Place , one of which the Prisoner own 'd to be his . John Wood . I was desir 'd by the Prosecutor to assist in taking the Prisoner . I took another Man with me , and we went one Way into the Field , and Collier and Hall another ; as soon as they got past the Gate , the Prisoner fired at Collier and wounded him : I saw the Fire fly , and immediately heard a crackling in the Hedge ; I jump 'd thro ' , and took the Prisoner with a Pistol leven 'd at my Head . Prisoner . I took him for a Thief , and did it in my own Defence . George Bridges . I assisted the last Witness , and when Hall and Collier came through the Gate , a Pistol was fir 'd , and presently we heard the Hedge crack ; we immediately got through the Hedge , and Wood presented his Gun at the Prisoner , and swore if he did not surrender , he would blow his Brains out , he then yielded to us and we took this Pistol out of his Hand . Prisoner . My Intention was to go to Thistleworth , to see a Friend , and I was weary , so I enter 'd this Field to rest myself , and just at that Moment this unhappy Affair happened . I was alone , and carried the Pistol for my own Defence . Guilty , Death . 3.

Thomas Cain . The Prisoner came to my Master 's Shop , on the 18th of October , about nine at Night , and ask 'd for two Pounds of Tea for Mr. Jones , of Stepney ; we refused to send it by him without the Money ; so I was to go with him for it ; and as we were going along a Field , he on a sudden tripp 'd up my Heels , fell on me with his Knees , and put a Knife to my Throat , and bid me deliver . He took from me 16 d. a pair of silver Shoe Buckles , a pair of white Metal Knee Buckles , my Stock , and a silver Clasp . The two Pounds of Tea he took from under my Arm when I fell ; I had it under my Arm , and in the Force of the Fall it flew from me . About a Fortnight after this , I saw the Prisoner in St. Giles 's Round-House , and knew him to be the Man who had robb 'd me , and he said , D - n it , it does not signify denying it , for I did do it . John Barfoot . I saw the Prisoner at the Round-House , and my Man said , This is the Man that robb 'd me ; he own 'd that he was the Man , and said that it signify 'd nothing denying it . He likewise confess 'd the same , when before the Justice . Randal Edwards .

He was a second Time charged by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Michael Moore . I took the Prisoner and the Deceased into my Coach at Piccadilly , and sat them down at the upper End of St. Giles 's . The Prisoner pull 'd a Pistol out of a green Bag , and flash 'd it ; the Deceased screamed out ; and he said , my Dear I know what I am doing of . He then was enquiring for a Gunsmith ( as he said ) to sell the Pistols , and just as we were got to the Door , I heard a Pistol go off ; I immediately turn 'd about and saw the Deceased lying dead on the Ground , the Pistols at the Prisoner 's Feet , and his Hand bloody . I asked him what he had done ? he said , it was his poor dear Sister , the youngest of three , and if he had killed her , he must be hang 'd . I did not know that he had Pistols , 'till I saw him draw one from under his Arm ; and I was going to knock at the Gunsmith 's Door when I heard the Report of the second Pistol . Jury . Did he present the first Pistol at the Woman ? Moore . I ca n't say it was more to her than to me , for we were all three a-breast , and nobody was by , for it was a dark Night , and it rain 'd very hard . Margaret Lee . I saw the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd married , in the middle of November , 1738 , and since that Time , he has used her very ill. On the 10th of October last , he struck her on the left Side , and broke her Lip ; the Tuesday after , he gave her a black Eye , and about a Week before she was kill 'd , she told me , she was afraid Mr. Jackson would murder her . I charged him twice with using her ill , and he own 'd it , and said , he would do so no more . I desired her to come from him , and she did so , but went to him again . Mr. Macdonnal . I was with the Deceased about a Month , and then the Prisoner used to beat her , and knock her down with his Fist . One Time after he had beat her , he beat me out of the Room , because I told him he would murder her . He had a Hanger , and she us 'd to hide it ( she said ) for fear he should kill her . On the Friday was sevennight , before the Murder , she was going to Mrs. Lee 's , and he met her in the Entry , and asked her where she was going ? he then struck her across the Nose , and made her bleed sadly . Thomas Martin . The Deceased came to my House , the Friday Night before she was kill 'd , and desired to lie there . She said she had been grosly abused by her Husband a long while , and she could not bear it ; she then had two black Eyes , which she said were given her by the Prisoner . Mr. Lewis , Surgeon . I inspected the Body of the Deceased , and found two Wounds , one on the Forehead , and the other on the upper Part of the Back , which was Mortal , and the Cause of her Death . It had penetrated through the Vertebre , and broke the Ribs . These Shot I took out of the Body , but there are a great many left behind ; and I apprehend the Pistol must be held quite close to the Body , to make such a Wound as this ; for which I have two Reasons ; the first is , if the Pistol had been at some Distance from the Body , the Shot would have seperated , whereas they all went in at one Orifice : My other Reason is , because the Lips of the Wound were actually burnt with the Powder . I believe the Pistol must likewise be held upwards , for the Wound penetrated obliquely downwards , and I think it could not be under his Arm , but even with this Posture . Mr. Colebroke , Surgeon , confirm 'd the above Deposition . A Witness . This is the Pistol which flash 'd in the Pan ; it is ten Inches in the Barrel , and loaded 8 Inches deep . Thomas Levett . I am a Constable , the Prisoner was brought to my House by two Coachmen on the 28th of Nov. he said he believ 'd he had killed his Sister , and was afraid she was dead . I asked him how he came to do it , and he said we might hang him , or do what we would with him , for he was afraid the poor Girl was dead . Ann Day . I fetch 'd the Deceased to Mrs. Lee 's , but she would not stay for fear he should kill her when she went Home . Defence . The Morning before this happen 'd , I was going out thinking to receive 30 l. and she went with me , but being disappointed of the Money , I took these Pistols out to Sell , and we went to my Mother 's in Clarges-Street to Dinner . I went from thence when I had din 'd , and left the Pistols with her , I came again , and as we were going along Piccadilly in our Way Home , it Rained , so I took her to a Tavern , and we dry 'd ourselves by the Fire ; she then wanted a Coach , and she said , as I had no Money she knew where to sell the Pistols , so I got a Coach , and she directed the Coachman where to stop ; and as I was pulling one out of the Bag , it snapp 'd , I took the other out by the Head , and that went off ; I was quite stupid , and do n't remember any Thing afterwards . Thomas Poole . I h ave known the Prisoner from his Infancy , and never saw any Thing but what was handsome by him . Ann Poole . The Prisoner and the Deceased dined at our House that Day , and were very loving together ; I have been at their House , and never saw her bruised or beat , nor ever heard her complain . John Dolley . I knew the Deceased before she was married , but I have not seen her above three or four Times since . William Hare . I work 'd with the Prisoner , and he always behav 'd very well , I never saw him beat her , and I do n't know that I ever heard her complain . Hester Jackson , the Prisoner 's Mother . They lived very lovingly for any Thing I know ; I have been at their House , and never observ 'd her to be bruised : I did once see a little yellow Speck about her Eyes , but I never asked the Occasion of it . Thomas Dump . They lived by me about three Quarters of a Year , but I have not seen them these twelve Months . Arthur White . I have known them about a Year and a half , I never saw her bruised at all that I can remember . Benjamin Lockyer was called , but could not say any Thing on either Side . Prisoner . My Wife has often desired a 'Prentice of mine to shew her how to load a Pistol , she has seen him do it , and I believe she loaded these herself . Guilty , Death . 7.

The Plank which goes a-cross the Cellar Doors where I let down my Beer , was taken up , and another Door which comes into the House was broke open ; I am sure all the Doors were safe when I went to Bed , and when I got up in the Morning I found them open , and my Goods were gone . John Lilliston . On Monday about the 10th Day of last Month , Coates , Nash , and I , went into Black-Fryars , I knock 'd at Mr. Dixey 's Door , ( it was between 8 and 9 at Night ) and asked for one Mr. King in White-Fryars ; I saw the Pewter lying on the Shelf , and went to tell the Prisoners , who were on the other Side of the Way , what I had seen , and then we went Home to Sarah Laxton 's in George-Alley , by the Ditch-side ; we got a Tinder-Box , and staid there till about one o'Clock , Laxton , Matthews , and Walker , were all there , we were contriving how to get into the House ; about one o'Clock we went to the House , and lifted up the Plank of the Window , Coates and Nash took up the Plank , and put me down the Cellar with my Tinder-Box , and they stood at the Top to watch . When I was down I burnt all the Tinder out , and could not get a Light , so I came up Stairs in a Hurry , because I was not willing to stay by myself in the Dark ; when Coates found that I had not got a Candle , he gave me a Knock , so I got a Light of a Watchman at the End of the Street , and he and I went down into the Cellar , and Nash stood on the outside ; we went up a pair of Stairs which goes into the House , and wrenched a Door open with Coates 's Chissel ; after that we open 'd the Street Door , and let the Prisoner Nash in , I went to pull the Lock Spring back , but I made a Noise with it , so Coates opened it himself ; when Nash came in we went into the Bar , and broke a Locker open , but found nothing in it ; we then took down all the Pewter , a large Brass Pottage Pot , and another Copper Pot , a Warming Pot , a Tea Kettle , a Box of Knives and Forks , a Pewter Gallon Pot , a Box Iron and Heater , and a Box of Tobacco . After we had taken them , I wrap 'd up the Pewter in my Apron , and Nash put them on his Head , the least Pottage Pot we put into a Bag , which we took out of the Cellar , and carried them and the rest of the Things to Laxton 's Lodgings . When we came there , Laxton was a Bed , and the Landlord would not let us in ; so Bess Matthews came down and open 'd the Door with a Poker , we went up Stairs into Laxton 's Room , and found Laxton asleep on the Bed ; Walker was there at the same Time , the Prisoner Coates and I lay there all Night , and we desir 'd Matthews to put the Goods up safe , so she took the Keys out of Laxton 's Pocket , and lock 'd the Pewter up in the Drawers , the Dishes we put between the Sacking and the Bed , while Laxton was asleep , and the other Things we put under the Drawers . The next Morning Nash came to us , the three Women Prisoners deliver 'd the Goods to us , and we mov 'd them by Degrees into Fleet-Lane , to one Wilson 's , and Coates was to sell them , he got 4 s. earnest for the Pewter , and then he took the Tea Kettle and the Copper Pot , up higher in the Lane , where we used to sell , but they were stopp 'd ; the largest Brass Pot , and the Warming Pot , Laxton and Walker sold for us , and they knew very well how we came by them ; they brought us 6 s. for the large Pot , and 1 s. for the Warming Pot , and Coates brought us 2 s. for the Tobacco , all which we three equally divided . Prisoner Coates . Ask him how much was divided ? Lilliston I think it was 4 s. a Piece , they gave me no more , Prisoner Walker . Ask him whether we had any of the Money ? Lilliston . They sold the Pot as I understand , for 7 s. 6 d and the Warming Pot for 1 s 6 d. and they brought us but 6 s. for the Pot , and 1 s. for the other . William Boomer . I am Constable of the Fleet Market , and hearing that a * Shop in the Market had been robb 'd a I went to the Prisoner Laxton 's Lodgings , to search for suspected Persons , I found a great many Goods in the Room , belonging to the Shop in the Market , and these Plates , Knives and Forks ; the Evidence , Coates , Laxton , and Matthews were then there . I took Coates away , and he said he knew nothing of the Matter ; I went back and took the Evidence , who was then a-bed , he told me of this House of Mr. Dixey 's , and his Account of the Fact to me exactly agrees with what he has said now . I found a Pottage Pot , according to his Directions , in Water Lane , and the Prisoner Walker told me , where she had pawn 'd the Funnel , the Box Iron and Heater , and said , they were brought in by the Prisoners . When Coates found that Lilliston was admitted an Evidence , he sent for me , and told me that he could make the most Discoveries , and would do it if he could be made an Evidence . This Chissel was brought to me by the Prisoner Laxton , before I carry 'd Coates to the Lord-Mayor , and she said it was the same Chissel with which Coates broke the House . * See the following Trial . John Paget . Laxton and Matthews brought a large Pot to my House , they asked 12 s. for it , and I gave them seven . Elizabeth Cluff . I live at Wilson 's in Fleet-Lane , some Pewter was brought to our House about three Weeks ago , and I saw it behind the Counter , cover 'd with a Sack , but who brought it I ca n't tell . The Prisoner Coates had 4 s. at our House , but I do n't know what it was upon . Boomer again .

They laid their Bundles down on the Ground , and said one to another : Come , let us go back for some more . I asked where they had them from ? and the Prisoner said , from a House in Rag-Fair ; they then went down the Alley , and I call 'd up Mr. Studder , and shut him into a Closet , because they should not see him . In a little Time they knock 'd at the Door , with each another Arm full of Cloaths , which they threw down on the Floor to the rest ; the Prisoner was for going for more , but Clack ( who was executed ) said , No , let us have some Victuals and Drink first . Aye , said the Prisoner , let us have three or four Shillings worth of Bread and Cheese . I catch 'd hold of these Words , and said , I would fetch some .

When I was call 'd out of Bed , I went to the House where that Gentlewoman who stands at the Bar lives , and we demanded Entrance ; she kept us some time at the Door before she would let us in , and when we did get in , I saw a great many of my Cloaths on the Cellar-stairs . Harman . Mrs. Carlow , was at that Time gone to France , and the Prisoner Frame , was left to take Care of the House . Prisoner Frame . I desire the Prosecutor may be ask 'd , whether he found any of his Cloaths in my Room ? Clack . I do n't remember that I was in her Room . Harman . I am positive it was the Prisoner Frame that kept us out , for I saw her thro ' the Key-Hole , and the Yard-Door was open , but I ca n't say that she knew of the other Prisoner 's going out . Frame . I waited in the Room with his Witnesses all the last Sessions , and he said my Name was never mentioned ; I drank Part of two full Pots of Beer with him . Clack . I did mention her Name here several Times ; and as to drinking with her , I do n't know but I might drink a drop of Gin with her . The Constable . I had Legrose 's Commitment from Justice Fowke to bring him to Newgate , and in the Way thither I told him he had better have gone abroad ; but he said , D - n it , it is too late now , but I wish I had the old Rogue ( the Prosecutor ) in my Place . He desired that I would speak for him , that he might be put in the same Place with his Accomplice Madder . Legrose . I know nothing of what is alledged against me . Frame . I was to have 2 s. a Week for looking after this Woman 's House ; I never saw this Man till I saw him in Prison . The Revd Mr. Guthrie . The Prisoner Frame liv 'd with me as a Servant two or three Years , and I never heard but that she was an honest Woman . Richard Yeomans . I have known her between five and six Years ; I never heard any Ill of her , but she always behav 'd herself well . Margaret Cray . She has been an honest Woman ever since I have known her ; I was her Bail , and do not think that she would receive Goods knowing them to be stolen . Legrose Guilty , Death . Frame Acquitted . 25 , 26 Samuel Stark , and John Ozell , of St. George , Hanover-Square , were indicted with ( John Champion , and Laurence Price not taken ) for that they not having God before their Eyes , & c. on Hugh Montgomery , in the Peace , & c. feloniously , & c. did make an Assault , and that Samuel Stark with a certain drawn Bayonet , made of Iron and Steel , value 1 s. which he had and held in his right Hand , on the left Side of the Breast , near the short Ribs of the said Montgomery , & c. did strike and stab , giving him then and there , & c. one mortal Wound of the Breadth of half an Inch , and Depth of five Inches , of which he instantly died ; and that John Ozell , John Champion , and Laurence Price were present , assisting , comforting , and maintaining him the said Stark , the Murder , & c. to commit and do , Dec. 10 . Stark was a 2d Time indicted on the Statute of Stabbing . He was a 3d Time indicted by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for feloniously slaying the said Montgomery . Capt . Carrel . We had Orders about last June , to raise 200 Men for the Service of the Government , we were recruiting very fast , the Savoy was full , and likewise Tilbury-Fort , so the Deceased took a House in Bond-Street , to put my Men in , and being confin 'd to my Bed , I left the Care of the House to him , and always thought him a very active , careful Man . Thomas Cliff . On the 3d of Dec. between 11 and 12 , I was at this House where the Recruits are kept , in Ducking-Pond Alley , in Bond-Street . The two Prisoners , and two other Soldier s knock 'd at the Door , Ozell for one Sturges ; I let him in , and going to but the Door , the other three forced in . They sent for a full Pot of Beer , and called Sturges down ; Stark immediately took him by the Collar , and said , G - d D - n you Sir , you are my Prisoner , and pull 'd out his Bayonet , and stuck it into the Door Post . I then called Mrs. Crosley , and she said , there were 38 Men in the House , and if they were let out they could not make them good ; but Stark said , that Sturges was a Deserter , and they would take a Deserter any where . I desired the Woman to go for the Deceased , or some Officer , they staid a good while , and the Deceased came ; I told him that they wanted Sturges away ; he then drew his Hanger and went in , and said , Gentlemen , what do you do here ? He put his Hanger up before he came into the Prisoner 's Sight , and bid me put them out of Doors . They all went away except Ozell , and the Deceased kept striking them with his Cane all the Way down the Steps , and as he was turning about to come in again , with his Cane under his Arm , Stark drew his Bayonet , and stabb 'd him under the left Pap . The Deceased immediately said he was killed ; he was carry 'd in Doors , and died in about 10 Hours . I pursued the Prisoner Stark , and took him about 200 Yards from the House , and when I came back with him , Ozell was standing by the Fire Side , and did not offer to do or say any Thing . When the Deceased came first into the Room , they were all standing with their Backs to the Fire , and he bid them go along , they mutter 'd something , and he then can 'd them out . Stark . On Wednesday last I met with Champion , Ozell , and Price ; they asked me to go and assist them to take a Deserter , I went with them , and thought it had been an Ale-House ; Sturges came down and they seized him ; I own I drew my Bayonet , but it was to keep the Deserter in the Room ; we all sat down , and were very easy till the Deceased came in , and then he drew his Hanger , and struck me several Times ; he came out of Doors and beat me , and I ca n't say but that I did take my Bayonet when his Blows came so fast , for I was afraid he would cleave me down . Stark Guilty Manslaughter . Ozell Acquitted . [ Branding . See summary . ] 27 . 28.

While I was shewing them these Goods , I saw the Woman stoop down twice below the Counter ; I suspected that they had stole some thing , so I counted over my Parcels , and miss 'd a pair of Stockings ; I call 'd out to a Person in the next Room , and the Prisoners were going out of the Shop , but hearing me cry out , they returned , and dropp 'd the Pair of Stockings which I miss 'd , on the Ground ; after they were gone , I missed another Pair , and this Gentleman ran after them and took them .

He was a 2d Time indicted for stealing 320 lb . of Pepper , the Goods of the same , Sept. 30 The Counsel for the Prosecution having open 'd the Indictment , and the Nature of the Evidence , the Witnesses were called . Joseph Burges . In September last was Twelve-months , the Prisoner and I , and another , were on board the Thomas and Mary Hoy , of which the Prisoner was Master . We went down the River to an Indiaman , to take our Loading , and when we came up to Botolph Wharf , the next Witness , and one Greenwood , were put on Board us , as Watchmen . There were a great many Bags of Pepper in the Hold , and we came to an Agreement to take a little , so I opened the Hold Doors , and Greenwood and I went down ; we took at that Time about 200 lb . Weight out of the Company 's Bags ; the Prisoner was at that Time keeping a Look-out on Deck , and he knew what we were about . We put the Pepper into two Bags , and got it into the Cabbin ; and the Prisoner and Clowes haul 'd it out on Deck . The next Night we took 130 lb . and put it into two Bags which we had of Mr. Ridout ; and after we had got it on Deck , the Prisoner and Clowes handed it into the Boat to us . We carried it to Ridout 's , and I saw one Bag started into his Cellar ; it was carried in at his Back-Door between 9 and 10 at Night , and he paid us for it . The Prisoner did not go with us in the Boat , but came to us by Land ; he was present at the paying of the Money , and receiv 'd his share of it . Prisoner 's Q . Who had the Keys of the Cabbin ? Burges . They hung up always on Deck . Prisoner 's Q . If any of these Goods which are taken in should be lost , who is to stand to the Damage ? Burges . I ca n't tell , - the Master I suppose . Samuel Clowes . I know the Prisoner very well . About the latter End of September , in the Year 39 , I was boarded on the Prisoner Oliver 's Hoy ; and about 8 or 9 in the Evening , Burges opened the Hold Doors , and fill 'd 2 Bags of Pepper ; the Prisoner and I haul 'd them on Deck , and help 'd to put them into the Boat . I did not go with them , for I and the Prisoner went by Land . When we came to Ridout 's , they had weighed the Pepper , and were casting up what it came to ; I think it was 32 l . I took 5 l. for mine , and my Partners Shoes , and I saw the Prisoner and Burges take theirs . I staid there to drink part of some Punch , and then went away . The Pepper was lock 'd up in the Hold , and the Keys were given to the Company ; but I believe these were private Keys with which Burges opened the Doors . Mr. Day . On the 12th of Sept. the Company 's Ship Scarborough , came to her Moorings , and was reported at the Custom-House ; on the 22d the Thomas and Mary Hoy came up from her , loaden with Pepper and other Goods . I do n't know exactly how many Bags there were . Councel . What Method is taken in locking up these Goods on Board the Hoy ? Mr. Day . The Commander locks up the Hatches , and the Keys are sealed up and given generally to the Husband of the Ship . This is done to prevent any one from getting at the Cargo ; and the Captain of the Ship sends up an Impression of the Seal which he intends to use . Councel . Have the Company ever suffer 'd by losing their Goods before ? Mr. Day . Yes , they have been very great Sufferers . Mr. Foster . At the Arrival of the Ships , they lighten at Long-Reach or Erith ; the Captain reports at the Custom House , and an Entry is made , that the whole Cargo may go out at once . It appears by the Register , that Greenwood and Clowes were at this Time on Board the Thomas and Mary Hoy , but Greenwood has absconded from his Duty , although he has given Security for the Performance of it . Councel to Burges . How many Bags were open 'd to take out this Pepper ? Burges . I believe 16 or 18 ; they were ty 'd at the Corners with Twine . Charles Cheney . I am Owner of the Hoy of which Oliver is Master . There are several Doors , all lock 'd with the Company 's Locks , and I believe they have a particular Key to each : but my People have no Right to go into the Hold ; they only unlock the Hatches , and the Company 's Porters sling the Goods out . Guilty . The Evidence to support the 2d Indictment was the same in Effect as the former , and the Jury found the Prisoner Guilty of that likewise . [ Branding . See summary . ] 36 , 37. Charles Little , and John Kilby , were indicted for stealing 40 lb . of Pepper , value 2 l. 10 s. the Goods of the united Company of Merchants trading to the East-Indies , July 15 . They were a 2d Time indicted for stealing 18 lb . of Tea , value 6 l. the Goods of the same , July 13 . Both acquitted of the first Indictment , Guilty of the 2d 4 s. 10 d. [ Branding . See summary . ] 38. Thomas Ridout , of St. John Wapping , Grocer , was indicted for that at a Sessions of Goal-Delivery , & c. at Justice-Hall , in the Old-Bailey , on Thursday the 4th of Dec. before the Rt . Hon . Humphry Parsons , Esq ; Mayor of the City of London , & c. & c. William Oliver was by due Course of Law convicted for that on the 30th of Sept. 320 lb . wt . of Pepper , the Goods of the united Company of Merchants trading to the East Indies , did steal , & c. and that afterwards on the 30th of Sept . he the said Ridout , the said Pepper did receive and have , & c. knowing it to have been stolen . He was a 2d Time indicted for receiving 160 lb . of Pepper , knowing it to be stolen . The Councel for the Prosecution set forth , that the Crime with which the Prisoner stood charg 'd , was of the most heinous Nature ; that it is owing to such Persons that so many Enormities are daily committed ; and unless there were People to receive Goods from Offenders , there would consequently be fewer , & c. & c. The Record of Oliver 's Conviction being read , the Witnesses were called . Joseph Burges . I know the Prisoner very well . Councel . Was you concern 'd in this Hoy ? Burges . Yes , I was Mate of her ; we had a Loading of Pepper from an East-India Man , in Sept. last was twelve Months . Councel . Give an Account where you saw the Prisoner , and what passed between him and you ? Burges . He came to us at Botolph Wharf , and beckon 'd me on Shore ; when I came to him , he asked me what Craft we ? I told him Pepper , he then asked me if he could Trade with me ? I said I did not know till I saw what Officers would be put on Board us . He asked me how we got into the Hold ? I told him we had Keys , but I had no Bags to put any Thing in ; he said if I would go Home with him , he would give me Bags ; I accordingly did , and he gave me two Bags , which we filled with the Company 's Pepper . After we had filled them , we put them into the Boat , and carried them in at the Prisoner 's Back Door , at Wapping New-Stairs , and he paid us for them . Councel . What Time of Night was it that you carry 'd the Pepper to his House ? Burges . It was between 9 and 10 at Night , and quite dark . Councel . Can you tell the Quantity ? Burges . Each Bag contained 112 lb . but the Prisoner struck off some for Dirt and Tare . Councel . Who took the Pepper from you out of the Boat ? Burges . Mr. Ridout himself was at the Door , he receiv 'd it from us , and paid us 10 l. for it . After he had weigh 'd it , he put the Pepper into a Tub , and gave me one of the Bags again to get some more ; and the next Night we got 130 lb . Wt . Councel . Who was this 10 l. paid to ? Burges . Clowes took his own and his Partner Greenwood 's Shares ; I took mine , and Oliver his , we had 50 s. piece . Councel . Was there any Bill of Parcels made ? Burges . No , I never saw any . Councel . Did Ridout pay you the Money himself ? Burges . Yes , and he was in the Room when we divided it . Prisoner Q . You say you told me , that you had the Keys of the Hold ; where was it ? Burges . It was ashore on the Key ; and there was no body but us two present ; it was the same Night as we came up , and we took the Pepper directly . Prisoner 's Q . Who put the Pepper into the Bags ? Burges . Greenwood and I ; the Master of the Vessel , and the other Officer haul 'd it into the Cabbin . Councel How much was allowed for Dirt and Tare ? Burges . Twelve Pounds . Councel . Where was the Pepper weigh 'd ? Burges . It was weigh 'd in his Warehouse , where his great Scales hang . Councel . Did any of his Servants assist him in weighing it ? Burges . No , there was none of the Family present but himself . Prisoner 's Q You speak of a Back-Door ; is it not a common passage to carry in all Goods that come by Water ? Burges . I ca n't tell ; I know they do carry in Goods there , and they call it a Back-Door . Prisoner 's Q Is it not a common place ? Burges . I never carry 'd Goods in at any other Door . Prisoner 's Q . On your Oath , did you never declare to any body that this Pepper was run ? Burges . No , I never said so in my Life . Councel . Was you in the Service of the Company then ? Burges . Yes , we had our Loading from one of their Ships , and this Pepper was taken out of our Hold at Botolph Wharf , where we lay sometimes 2 or 3 Days before any body come to touch our Goods . Samuel Clowes . About the latter End of Sept. in the Year 39 , I was boarded on the Thomas and Mary Hoy , which was loaden with Bags of Pepper . About 10 at Night , Burges open 'd the Hold Doors , and fill 'd 2 Bags ; they were carried to Ridout 's House . I did not see him fill the Bags ; but there was no body but him and Greenwood below ; they were put into the Boat , and I and Oliver walked down by Land to Ridout 's , where I saw him pay 10 l. and I suppose on Account of the Pepper . The Money was equally divided amongst us , and the Prisoner said he should be very proud of such another Freight . Councel . Who was present at that Time ? Clowes . There were Burges , Oliver , and myself . Councel . Did you hear any Discourse about the Price ? Clowes . No ; the Pepper had been weigh 'd , and carry 'd away before I got there ; but I saw the Prisoner pay the Money , and I believe he was present at the Division of it . Councel . Were any of his Apprentices or Servants present ? Clowes . No , I saw none , - in my Opinion it seem 'd to be a private Transaction . Councel . Was there any Receipt given for this Money ? Clowes . No , not that I saw . Councel . Did you drink any Thing at the Prisoner 's House ? Clowes . Yes , we had some Punch , but we paid for it ourselves . Prisoner 's Q . Did not you pretend that this Pepper was a Perquisite ? Clowes . No , I never said so . Prisoner 's Q . You say that Burges put the Pepper into the Boat ; who went with him ? Clowes . There was no body but Burges and Robinson in the Boat . Prisoner 's Q . Who paid for the Punch ? Clowes . Mr. Ridout sells Liquors ; we treated him with the Punch , and paid for it among our selves . Councel . How many Bags were open 'd , to take out this Pepper ? Clowes . I ca n't tell ; - I was walking on Deck with Oliver at that Time . Burges . About 18 or 20 were opened ; we took about 8 or 10 lb . out of each Bag , and sew 'd them up again . Matthew Robinson . I went in the Boat with the Pepper . Councel . Where did you carry it ? Robinson . To the Prisoner 's House , at Wapping-new Stairs . Councel . What Time of Night was it ? Robinson . I ca n't exactly tell the Hour ; but it was dark . Councel . When you came to the Prisoner 's House , who took the Pepper out of the Boat ? Robinson . Burges took it out of the Boat , and carried it in at the Back-door . Councel . Did you go into the House with Burges ? Robinson . Yes ; I went in , and the Prisoner gave me a Dram , and sent me about my Business , to take Care of the Boat . Councel . I would ask you whether there were any People at Work on the Keys ? Robinson . No , when we carried the Pepper away , the Porters had done Work on the Keys . Prisoner 's Q . Who paid you for your Boat ? Robinson . It was not my Boat ; - that belong 'd to the Hoy . Councel . We shall now shew , that Greenwood is not to be found , although the Strictest Enquiry has been made after him . Mr. Foster . I am one of the Inspectors of the River ; and it is my Business to see that the Tidesmen do their Duty . I find by the Register , that these 2 Men Clowes and Greenwood were at this Time boarded as Watchmen , on the Thomas and Mary Hoy . Councel . Please to give an Account what Enquiry has been made after Greenwood ? Mr. Foster . Since the Discovery of the Hoy 's being robb 'd , the strictest Search has been made after Greenwood , but to no purpose ; and he has absconded from his Duty ever since , although he has given Security for the Performance of it . This Warrant in my Hand is against him - I received it from Sir William Billers The Warrant was read . Mr. Gambier Sworn . Councel . What was the Price of Pepper in Sept. Sale , 1739 . Mr. Gambier . In that Sale , the Company 's Pepper sold from 10 d 78ths , to 11 d. farthing the Average was above 11 . They allow the Buyer 6 l. 10 s. Discount , and likewise the home Consumption Duty , which is about 4 d. per lb . so that in the whole Bag it might come to a Groat less than 12 d. per lb . Councel . What was it worth at that Time , every Duty paid ? Mr. Gambier . The nearest Computation that can be made , is 14 d. farthing , it was worth so much at that Time , Duty paid . Councel . Suppose a Man had come to you , and offer 'd you Pepper at 12 d. per lb . what should you have thought of it ? Mr. Gambier . If Pepper had been offer 'd me at 13 d. per lb . I should not have thought it honestly come by . Councel . Is there a large profit on this Pepper ? Mr. Gambier . In the Wholesale Way , there is not a half-penny per lb I believe all the Year round . Councel . How much is generally allowed for the Tare of each Bag ? Mr. Gambier . The Company allow 15 lb . for the Tare of a Bag of 112 lb . for a Bag of 100 lb . 12 lb . Tare is too much . Prisoner 's Q . Suppose the Pepper had been damaged , or put into foul Bags , what then ? Mr. Gambier . Damaged Pepper will not bear the price of good to be sure ; but putting it out of one Bag into another will not hurt it , provided it does not come to any Wet , and the Pepper be found at first . Prisoner 's Q . Is there not a great deal of Waste and Dirt in this Pepper ? Mr. Gambier . In the last Sale , 5400 Bags of Pepper were sold , and out of those , there were 116 Bags of Dust ; but these Bags of Dust do not weigh so much as Bags of Pepper , although they are of the same Size Mr. Robert Day . The Scarborough Pepper in 39 , after it had been sitted sold for about 11 d. Farthing to 3 8ths per lb . and I believe it might amount to about 14 d , Farthing Duty paid . Mark Hudson . Mr. Torin sold Pepper after the Company 's Sale in Sept. was 12 Months , for 11 d. per lb . and the Buyer paid the Duty , but we never buy any but for Exportation . It was here urg 'd on the Part of the Defendant , that Oliver in Point of Law could not be deem 'd a Principal ; but that in Order to have brought the Defendant to Trial , Burges and Robinson , who were principally concern 'd in stealing these Goods , should first have been convicted , & c. & c. Defence . Prisoner . I had known Burges some Years , and believ 'd him to be a very honest Man ; I have bought China Bowls and Handkerchiefs of him , and when I bought this Pepper , I thought it might be run , but could not think it was stolen ; if I had , I never should have given 1 s. per lb . for it . My Servants will make it appear , that I bought it full of Dust ; they brought it to the fore part of the Shop to clean , and I sold it again for 13 d. Half-penny per lb . - The Prisoner 's Sister . I remember there was some Pepper brought in at the Back Door , about 8 or 9 at Night ; the next Day it was carry 'd into the publick Shop , and clean 'd ; - there were a vast many Stones and Dirt in it . Prisoner 's Q . Did it look like a private Transaction ? The Witness . No ; I saw one Bag weigh 'd , and it was emptied into some Casks in the Shop , which stood next the Street ; - the Shop was not shut up , neither fore Door , nor back Door . Prisoner 's Q . Is not this Door a common Passage for Goods ? The Witness . Yes ; all the Goods we ship off , or receive by Water come to this Door . Councel . Did you see Burges bring these Bags ? The Witness . No : I ca n't say who brought them . Councel . Does your Brother use to receive Goods in at this Door , at 9 o'Clock at Night ? The Witness . Yes ; according to the Time of the Tide . Councel . Do you know whose Bags those were which were brought to your House , - are they your Brother 's ? The Witness . I ca n't say they are ; I saw no Mark on them ? Alice Obermore . I was Servant to the Prisoner at the Time when this Pepper was brought . I ca n't say what Time it was ; but it was brought in at the back Door , - as publickly as other Goods , and the next Day it was carry 'd into the Shop and clean 'd for Sale . Councel . Did you see it weigh 'd ? Obermore . Yes , but I ca n't tell the Weight of it - I did not take much Notice of it . Councel . Where was it weigh 'd ? Obermore . In the same Place with all the large Goods . Councel . There was some Punch carry 'd in , where was that ? Obermore . It was in a Room joining to the publick Shop , and after the Money was paid . Councel . How much Money was there paid ? Obermore . I ca n't tell how much , but I saw it paid down . Prisoner 's Q . Was this done in a private Manner ? Obermore . No , it seem 'd to be as publick as all the rest of his Dealings . Councel . Did you see Burges and Oliver there ? Obermore . Yes , but I ca n't remember that I saw Clowes . Councel . Who divided the Money ? Obermore . I ca n't tell , - I was in and out , and did not take much Notice . Councel . How many Persons partook of the Punch ? Obermore . I ca n't say , - I remember only Burges and Oliver . Councel . Do you remember your Master 's giving a Dram to any Body ? Obermore . The Lad came in , and I believe my Master did ask him to drink a Dram , and Oliver sent him about his Business . Councel . Do you know how much your Master was to give for the Pepper ? Obermore . A Shilling a Pound , I believe . Councel . I would ask you , whether there is not a fore Shop , a back Shop , and a Room between ? Obermore . Yes , there is a Door to keep the Air out , but it was wide open . Councel . Where do the Casks stand which this Pepper was emptied into , in the fore Shop or the back Shop ? Obermore . In the fore Shop , just by the Door . Councel . Where was it weigh 'd ? Obermore . In the back Shop ? Prisoner 's Q . Are there any other great Scales beside those in the back Shop ? Obermore . No , none that will weigh 100 wt . of Goods . Councel . Were any of your Master 's Servants present at the weighing of the Goods ? Obermore . No , he had no Apprentice , nor Journeyman at that Time ; he used to serve in the Shop himself . The Prisoner 's Sister again . I used to serve when my Brother was out , and used to sell this Pepper for 14 or 15 d. per lb . and by the Ounce for five Farthings , after it was clean 'd . Mr. Marlow . I bought Pepper of the Company in September was Twelve-months , from 10 d 78ths , to 11 d. 1 8th per lb . 6 and a half per Cent . Discount ; which reduces the price to 10 d. Farthing ; the Duty is near a Groat . Prisoner 's Q , Suppose you should buy Pepper unclean 'd , would you give 1 s. per lb . for it ? Mr. Marlow . I never buy any unclean 'd . Councel . What would you say , it a Person brought you Pepper for 12 d per lb . Mr. Marlow . It might not be worth the Money . Councel . I speak Sir , of that Pepper in Sept. Sale , 39 , what should you think if it was offer 'd you for 1 s per lb . Mr. Marlow . I would not have bought it at all , for I should have thought it had been run , or - Councel . Or what ? Mr. Marlow . Or otherwise come by . Councel . This Pepper was weigh 'd ; could the Prisoner be a Judge whether it was worth 15 d. or 12 d. per lb . Mr. Marlow . Yes , I think so . I have known the Prisoner a great many Years ; he always bore the Character of a fair Dealer , therefore I do n't think he would buy Goods knowing them to be stolen . Mr. Shippey . I have known the Prisoner 5 or 6 Years ; and he always bore the Character of an honest fair Dealer . Mr. SHERIFF Marshall . I have known him a great many Years ; he always behav 'd as an honest Man , and I never heard his Character call 'd in Question . Mr Roberts , Mr. Camden , Mr. White , Mr. Neaves , Mr. Burnet , Mr . Pool , Mrs. Ridout , Mr. Earle , Mr. Clarke , Mr. Windsor , Mr. Priestly , the Rev . Mr. Wilson , and Mr. Hudson , gave the Prisoner the Character of a very honest Man , and did not believe that he would buy Goods , knowing them to be stolen The Jury withdrew , and after a short Stay , return 'd and brought the Prisoner in Not Guilty .
