Samuel Spencer depos 'd , That on the Monday before the Accident , in the Morning , the Deceas 'd came into his House to heat a Glew Pot , that the next Day not seeing the Deceas'd 's Door open as usual , and seeing the Key was not in the Lock , he told a Neighbour he believ 'd he was dead , that finding the Door not open next Morning , which was Wednesday , he sent for the Deceas'd 's Son , that his Grandson came , and they together listed up the Window , which was loose and then he went in and let in the Deceas'd 's Grandson , and they found a great deal of Blood on the Floor near the Bed , and that something lay on the Bed in a Lump , but he could not say it was the Deceas 'd , this was about 10 o'Clock . Alexander Nisbitt , Grandson of the Deceas 'd , depos 'd , That when he went into the Deceas'd 's Room on Wednesday Morning about 10 o'Clock , he found him lying upon the Bed , his Head covered , and his Breast naked , that he perceived he was dead , and saw the Blood by the Bedside , as if it had ran off the Bed , and he went and told his Father without making any further Discovery .

Agnes Daniel depos 'd , That she keeps a Cook 's Shop near the Place where the Deceas 'd lived , and that about a Quarter after 9 that Morning the Prisoner was found murdered ( tho ' a considerable Time before it was known to any but the Prisoner ) the Prisoner came to her , and said , I am ruin 'd and undone for ever , Mr. Nisbit is dead , and he fear 'd he was murder 'd , that she bid him go and learn how it was , and in half a Quarter of an Hour he return 'd , and said , Mr. Nisbitt was murdered and robb 'd of all he had , that they had taken his Watch and Money , his best Hat and Wig , and opened his Trunk , which had two Iron Bolts to it , and taken all the Money away and every Thing else but a Stock and Turnover , and a Razor , with which it was said he used to shave the Deceas 'd , and he fear 'd they would take him up upon Suspicion , that this was told her by the Prisoner before Ten o'Clock on the Wednesday Morning , that she had known the Prisoner for some Time to be an idle Fellow , going about to Alehouses with two Jows Harps , which he used to play upon ; that the Deceas 'd was a grave , sober , good Man , and had the Character of a true Servant of God , and that at Christmas last he came to Dine at her House , and the Prisoner coming there and seeing Mr. Nisbitt , ran out again as fast as he could , and Mr. Nisbitt seeing him , said , he might well run , for he had lent him Money to buy the Cloaths on his back , and been kind to him , and he had not made a grateful Return ; these Things , she said , came fresh into her Memory , and she told the Prisoner of it , and had some Fear he was guilty . William Thompson depos 'd , That he was with William Barnes , on the Wednesday Morning about two o'Clock , when they saw the Prisoner at a Publick House , but he did not hear the Prisoner mention Mr. Nisbitt 's Death , and that he was with Mr. Shalley the Constable at the Deceas'd 's Room , and that he found the Razor with which the Deceas 'd was murder 'd . Mr. Shelley depos 'd , That about 12 , or betwixt that and one of the Clock on the Wednesday , hearing of the Murder he went to the Place and found the Sheath of the Razor upon the Bolster , and about a Quarter of an Hour after , he , with William Thompson , the Watchman , look 'd for the Instrument , and Thompson found the Razor behind the Deceas 'd all bloody , which he shew 'd to the Court , and farther said , that this Morning , i.e . the Morning the Trial was heard , one Isaac Dale had informed him in the Presence of Agnes Daniel , that the Prisoner offered two Razors to pawn or sell at a Gin Shop , on the Sunday Night before the Murder was committed , and described one of the Razors , which exactly answer 'd the Description of this Razor . Mr. Shelley produc 'd it in Court , it being tied at the End towards the Blade , with a Piece of Thread , the Handle of it crooked , and one side of the Rivet broke off , and this Description he gave without seeing it , or having it describ 'd . Isaac Dale depos 'd , That on Sunday the 26th of January , the Prisoner came into a Gin Shop where he was drinking about eight at Night , and begg 'd they would lend him 6 d. and a Quartern of Gin on 2 Razors , that he had a Mind to buy one , and look 'd at it , and remember 'd very well the Handle was tied at the End next the Blade with a piece of Thread , that the Handle was crack 'd , and that at one End the River , or piece of Pewter which covers the Rivet , was broke off on one side , the Razor being shew 'd him which was found upon the Bed behind the Deceas 'd , he was positive it was the very same the Prisoner offer 'd at the Gin Shop as aforementioned . Mrs. Edwards depos 'd , That she was present when the Key of the Deceas'd 's Door was found on the Wednesday after the Murder was discover 'd , and it lay about half a Yard from the Door , as if it had been thrust under , this was likewise observed by others , and the Key with which Mr. Spencer opened the Door , belong 'd to another though it opened that . He said in his Defence , That he knew nothing of the Matter , but confess 'd that the Deceas 'd had been a very good Friend to him , and lent him Money to buy Cloaths and 3 Ells of Holland , which he pawn 'd , and the Deceas 'd lent him Money to fetch them out of pawn , but he could give no satisfactory Account as to the Razor , nor could he deny being with the Watchmen on the Wednesday Morning , tho ' he would not confess he said Mr. Nisbitt was dead . William Graham depos 'd , That the Prisoner was his Journeyman , and had been so a Year , that he was at Work on the Monday , Tuesday , and Wednesday aforemention 'd , that he would sometimes work , he sometimes very idle , that he had an excellent Hand at playing upon 2 Jews Harps at once , which involv 'd him in bad Company and exposed him to keep ill Hours , that the Day before this Murder was discovered , he had a Wedding at his House , and the Prisoner was there , and said till 12 at Night , and further , told a long Tale , or compound of Mirth and Madness , as their throwing the Stocking , drinking , dancing , and playing upon the Jews Harps , which he said , the Prisoner had pawn 'd for 3 d. and he lent him Money to fetch them , and that the Prisoner got drunk and carried the Bridegroom 's Wig home , and next Morning he had lost it , that on the Wednesday Morning about 9 or 10 o ' Clock he came with a Concern , and said , he had lost his best Friend Mr. Nisbitt , for his Throat was cut . He call 'd other Witnesses , but none of them could say any Thing material , one indeed , with some heat pretended to invalidate the Evidence of William Barnes , the Watchman , on his saying the Prisoner told h im of Mr. Nisbitt 's Death at Two o'Clock on the Morning before the Murder or his Death was found out or discovered . I heard William Barnes say , said this Deponent , That he had spoke a silly Word , which would bring him into Trouble at the Old Bailey , for he heard Peter the Irishman say , ( that was a Nick-name the Prisoner went by ) that Mr. Nisbitt was dead at Two o'Clock in the Morning , and he had told it to others : But this was so far from taking off the Evidence of Barnes , that it rather confirm 'd it , every Circumstance being considered , and the several Incidents compar 'd , the Jury found him guilty .

Robert Hudson , the Servant of this Deponent depos 'd , That he was present when the Prisoner made this Confession .

Mr. Gough depos 'd to the like Effect , confirming every Circumstance with the former Deponents , adding , That when William Marple was before Justice Slaughter , he seem 'd inclined to make a Confession if he could-be admitted as an Evidence ; but finding that not to be obtain 'd , he said , he should not take two Lives away and be of no Service to himself : However , he own 'd that Rowden was the first Man who assaulted Mr. Stout , and he himself ran up a dirty Lane , thinking if he was pursued , they would not follow him in such a Place .

Mr. Sharpless , the Constable , depos 'd , That he went by Steward 's Information to his Room , with others , and found Henry Geahogan there sitting by the Fire side , and 16 counterfeit Sixpences upon the Table , which were produced in Court unfinished ; that they found a Tub by the side of the Bed , in which was Moulds , Files , Crucibles , a Ladle , several Sorts of Metal , and other Materials for their Purpose , and that then Geahogan seem 'd in great Surprize , insomuch that the Sweat ran down his Face , that he then went to Blake 's Room , and found him by a Charcoal Fire made in a Chavendish , on which he had put a Pan of Water , and a piece of Bacon in a Pan , but neither of them were warm , which made him believe they were put on upon the Surprize he might be put in upon his coming up Stairs , however , nothing was found in his Room but a Bottle of Vitorel . Mr. Jacock confirm 'd every Part of this Evidence , adding , that when they went into the Room to Geahogan , he said to Steward , I little thought you would have took my Life away . Mr. Jones depos 'd , That he assisted in taking Blake and said as was mentioned before on that Occasion by Mr. Sharpless , who likewise went with him to the Lodgings of Katherine Geahogan , and found there a Paper of mix 'd Metal and a piece of a File , on the Edges of which was the appearance of the Metal . Most of the Circumstances were likewise confirm 'd by Mr. King , who assisted in taking them . Mrs . Cope depos 'd , That she kept the Temple Muse Alehouse in White Fryers , when the bad 6 d. was brought by Steward , and her Servant Maid depos 'd , That she carried it back , and Geahogan gave her another for it . Mrs. Bignel the Pawnbroker produced the bad Shilling she had of Blake , and said , he swore by G - d he took it of her , and made some Imprecations because she scrupled it ; but when he was gone out she heard some of them say , we have put the Bite upon the Mort . Mary Ferry depos 'd , That Blake paid her Money , and she did not like a Shilling and a Sixpence and returned them . Mr. Little depos 'd , He had taken a bad Sixpence of Henry Geahogan , or at least he offered it to him , and at another Time he offered him a bad Shilling , which he broke and flung away . Mr. Pinkney , Deputy Warden of the Mint , examined the Moulds and other Tools , and gave his Opinion that they were for counterfeiting Money . Blake made a long Defence , and endeavoured to prove he was innocent , and that the Whole was a Contrivance of Steward 's , out of Malice , and call 'd several to his Character . Henry Geahogan said in his Defence , That Steward had contrived all this , and he had no Hand in it . Katherine Geahogan , in her Defence , proved her Son Henry a most accomplish 'd Villain , by the Deposition of Rachael Abbot , who swore , that he beat his Mother in a most barbarous Manner , for which he was sent to the Gatehouse , but the End was , to prove that Steward did not know Katherine Geahogan at the Time he said she assisted in making Money , for said they , he came to intercede with the Mother for the Son 's enlargement , and in Discourse , told me , he did not know the Mother , or had ever seen her , and this was on the 30th of Jan. but Steward said , she assisted in making Money on the 12th of February : Several gave her an extraordinary Character , for an industrious sober Person ; the Jury acquitted her and found the other two guilty .

Charles Waring depos 'd , That when his Master was gone out and left the Money in the Till , the Prisoner told him he must go down to Breakfast , for it was ready , that he first went into the back House , and when he return 'd the Prisoner was gone , and after his Master return 'd the Robbery was discovered . Robert Matthews , the Keeper of Oxford Goal , depos 'd , That he was present when the Prisoner confessed the Fact , that he opened the Till with a Knife , and took out the Bag of Money ; the Jury found him guilty .

Thomas Foreman being admitted an Evidence , depos 'd , That he was disappointed in receiving some Money , and told his Complaint to Galey , who said , he had Money owing a little way out of Town , and if he would go with him to receive it he would lend it him ; that he consented to go , and accordingly a Day or two after went , and Galey brought Sparrow to go with them , that they all mounted and rode towards Edger , and on Bushey Heath Galey discover 'd himself , and said , if he would be true , they would drive the Road before them , and gave him a Pistol ; that he was surpriz 'd , not suspecting their Purpose before , knowing Galey lived by selling Brandy about the Country , yet seeing him resolute , and fearing they would use him ill , if he should refuse , he took the Pistol , tho ' with the atmost reluctance , that presently they met 3 Men on Horseback whom they resolved to attack , but he prevailed with them to decline it , saying , they were equal in Number and it was hazardous ; that afterwards they met a single Person , and Galey clapp 'd a Pistol to his Breast and took his Money , and then led him out of the Road , Sparrow guarding him with a Pistol ; that it was about 4 in the Afternoon , and being Dusky he got a little before them , and put Spurs to his Horse , endeavouring to get away , but they pursued and overtook him , Galey clapp 'd a Pistol to his Breast , and swore he was a Rogue , and he had a good Mind to leave him dead on the Spot ; that to save his Life he protested he had no Design to leave them , but he had lost Sight of them by Accident , it being hazy ; that Galey then said , he 'd forgive him , and they 'd rob the first Man they met , and accordingly they met the two Prosecutors , and robb 'd them of the Goods and Money mentioned in the two Indictments ; that after they robb 'd two more , and a Boy , suppos 'd to be a Servant to his Grace the Duke of Chandois , was going to ride off , which Galey perceiving , hid him follow him , which he did , and the Boy gave him 18 Pence , but Galey made him search the Boy for more , which he did , and found in his Pocket a half Guinea ; that after this Day 's Exploits Galey and Sparrow insisted upon his going again , but the Practice being contrary to his Inclinations , he gave Information against them , and had them apprehended , and assisting in apprehending them , he found in Galey 's Lodgings two Brace of Pistols , loaded with Powder and Ball . Jonathan Groom swore positively to their Persons , and of his being robb 'd of the Money mentioned in the Indictment , by them and the several Persons concerned in taking them confirmed the Deposition of Foreman , in that Part of their being apprehended by his Information , and the Pistols being found loaded at Galey 's Lodgings . It appeared by the Depositions of the Prosecutors , that the Robberies were committed about 3 Miles and a half from London , half a Mile on the other side Killbourn , and a Mile or more on this side the five Mile Stone ; the Fact being plainly proved , the Jury found them both guilty . Death . John Essington , late of Wandsworth , Esq ; and Merchant , was indicted and brought to Trial , pursuant to his own Prayer , for concealing 2 Books of Accompts from the Commissioners , he being declared a Bankrupt . David Avery , of Broadstreet , London , was call 'd to prove him a Trader , as also James Duke Crisp , of Wandsworth . David Avery depos 'd , That he bought and sold Goods for Mr. Essington , but could produce no Evidence of his having any such Orders from Mr. Essington , and calling upon Nathaniel Rolsey , Esq ; whither he had not bought some Brandy , he declar 'd , that the Bill of Parcels and Receipt were both in Mr. Avery 's own Name , and that he knew nothing of Mr. Essington 's being any way concern 'd . Crisp spoke to his Trading in general , but supported by no other Evidence but his own . The Commission itself was produced , after which Mr . Crisp depos 'd , That he , on the 2d of January , 1727 , denied the said Mr. Essington , by his own Order , to one Devon at the Copper Office in Bush-Lane , but Devon , on his Examination could not be certain to the Day , so that the Trading and Act of Bankruptcy rest 'd wholly on the Evidence of David Avery , and Crisp . Mr. Essington resting it there , desired they would proceed to the Concealments . Mr . Crisp depos 'd , That he had seen a Book of 13 Inches long and 4 wide , in which Mr. Essington made Entries of all his Promissary and Negotiable Notes to him and Avery and that he saw it in his Custody on the 25th of Jan. 1727 , and that that Book was not amongst his Books and Papers delivered up to the Commissioners , but being Cross-examined , could not name one single Item in the pretended Book . David Avery depos 'd , That he had seen a Marble colour 'd Quarto writing Book , in which he believed Mr. Essington had made Entries of their Accompts , for that he check 'd his , the said Avery 's Accompts thereby at the King 's Arms in St. Paul 's Church-Yard , but he , upon a Cross-examination could not name one single Article therein . William Russel , formely a Coachman to Mr. Essington , depos 'd , He had seen Mr. Essington make several Entries in a Book or Books , but did not know the Contents . Several other Witnesses were call 'd to the same Effect , but theirs was all hearsay , and nothing of their own Knowledge . Mr. Essington , in order to his Defence , had obtained an Order of the Court for Liberty to inspect his Books and Papers , which the Prosecutors detain 'd to the last Extremity , on Pretence they were too numerous to be brought , but before the Trial came on they brought them in a Sack . Mr. Essington , in his Defence , denied ever having a Book 13 Inches long and 4 wide , but admitted he had such a Marble colour 'd Book as describ 'd by David Avery , and very plainly proved the Delivery thereof by the Person who assisted in making out his Accompts , and by the Depositions before the Commissioners , and of several Letters to support the Charges in his Accompts against Crisp and Avery and call 'd upon the Prosecutors to produce the Papers deliver 'd up to them , which they not doing , he proved by Mr. Goostree , Mr. Thornley , and Mr. Horan , that they had given Notice to Mr. Hurdman Attorney to the Commission , to produce the same , and that they themselves had examined all the Papers he produced , and that the Marble colour 'd Book Mark 'd K Numb . 7. in the Examination before the Commissioners , and 28 material Letters under Crisp 's own Hand , to support the said Accompts , were not to be found amongst them , though Letter K , Numb 8 , and 9 , were produced , and the acting Commissioners being present , gave the Court a full Account of what passed before them , and several Witnesses being examined to the threatning Expressions Crisp had made use of , if Mr. Essington would not screen him ; and the very great Character given him by a great Number of Persons of Honour and Distinction , the Jury in a very short Time , after a Trial of 7 Hours , brought him in Not guilty , which gave a general Satisfaction , it appearing a scandalous and malicious Prosecution , carried on by the Debtors to his Estate . Robert Blake , Hanah Blake , alias Hozel , Henry Geabogan , alias Gorgan , and James Ferris , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , were indicted for High Treason , in counterfeiting the current Coin of this Kingdom , in particular 7 Pieces of Money , bearing the Similitude of Half Crowns , and Six Pieces of Money call 'd Sixpences , and for putting off the said Money for good Coin , knowing the same to be false and counterfeit . John Steward , was an Evidence against Robert Blake , Henry Geahogan , and Katherine Geahogan , ( who before was an Evidence in this Prosecution ) the former Part of his Evidence was the same as in the former Trial , of his becoming acquainted with Blake , Geahogan , and Ferris , and coming to the Fact for which they stood indicted , he said , that on the 3d of February last , about Two o'Clock , Blake , Ferris , Geahogan , and himself , jointly agreed to make some Money , that they all assisted in it , that Geahogan made the Moulds , and Ferris struck in the Nails after he had straitned them , and Blake 's Wife held the Tobacco-pipe in which the mix 'd , base Metal was melted , that Blake and himself by Turns blow 'd the Fire , that Ferris pull 'd out a good Half Crown , which they put into the Moulds , which were fill 'd with Whiting , and so they made the Impression , and that then they cast 6 or 7 Half Crowns of mix 'd Metal , when Ferris took one of them in his Hand , and said , it was a very good one , and look 'd well , and advised them to carry only one bad piece of Money about them at a Time , and a good Piece , and if any Trouble should come upon them he would bring them off , for he was an Attorney and understood the Law ; and that after this they made 6 or 7 Sixpences he likewise swore , that Blake put off some counterfeit Shillings , and Ferris put off two . And to confirm the Particulars , he produced the same Witnesses as were call 'd in the former Trial . Ferris brought two Witnesses , who severally depos 'd , That on the 3d of February he was with them at Westminster from Two till Four , and produced a Note which he wrote that Day , and it was so dated , but this was not believed by the Jury , who brought him , Geahogan , and Robert Blake , in guilty .
