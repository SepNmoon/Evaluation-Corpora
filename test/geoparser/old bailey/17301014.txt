The Prosecutor depos 'd , That those were the Rings of which she had been Robb 'd . The Prisoners deny 'd the Fact , and their being in Company with Fink and Warrington ; and Obrien call 'd several Evidences , who depos 'd , That Obrien was at Home at his Father 's House , at the time the Fact was committed . Richard Hasper depos 'd , That the Prisoner Obrien invited him to Supper that Friday Night , it being his Birth-day , that he was there from 10 to 3 in the Morning . Thomas Clements depos 'd be same the other had done . Ferrers Obrien , the Prisoner 's Father , depos 'd the same ; but being ask 'd by the Court , how he knew it was the time when the Robbery was committed , said it was the Friday Night , the 17th Day of the Month , but could not tell what Month it was . Bridget Obrien depos 'd , That she saw him go to Bed the 17th of July , having been at Supper , and a Merry-making , till between 9 and 3 o'Clock the next Morning .

Mary Jones depos 'd , That as to the Ring that Bryan had , she lent it him , that it had been given her by Warrington that Saturday Morning about 8 o'Clock , and half an Hour after she lent it to Bryan for 2 or 3 Days , he being going to Windsor ; but the Jury not giving credit to these Evidences , the Jury found them all three Guilty of the Indictment . Death . These Prisoners were also indicted a second time for taking a Pocket , and 4 s. in Money , & c. from Margaret Lecroy at the same time . This Prosecutor being in the Coach with the former , the Evidences to this Fact were the same as to the former ; the Fact being plainly proved , the Jury found them all Guilty of this Indictment likewise . They were all three indicted a third time for Assaulting and Robbing Abraham Reynardson , Esq ; and taking from him a Silver-hilted Sword , a Gold Watch , a Gold-headed Cane , and 6 s. in Money , the 16th of July last . The Evidences to this Fact were the same as to the others . Mr. Reynardson depos 'd , That as he was walking Home near the Turnstile in Holbourn , two pass 'd by him , and the third turn 'd up on him , and collaring him , the rest came back again , and Robbed him of the Things mentioned in the Indictment . Warrington depos 'd , That the Prisoners and Fink , with himself , committed the Robbery ; that himself and Johnson pass 'd the Prosecutor , and Bryan collar 'd him , and put a Pistol to his Head , and Morris was a little way behind ; that Bryan took the Watch , and Fink took the Money out of his Pocket , and Johnson his Silver-hilted Sword and Cane . Mary Warrington depos 'd , That Huky Morris came to her House the Morning ( before they were taken up on the Sunday ) at Four o'Clock , and all the three Prisoners were there , and also Fink and her Husband ; and her Husband gave her a Gold Watch , and a Gold-headed Cane , and that about 7 or 8 o'Clock they came again , and shew 'd her 4 Diamond Rings , and Bryan had 2 of them ; they told her they were going to Windsor to fetch a Wife of Bryan 's , and she saw them get on Horseback . The Fact likewise being plainly proved , the Jury found them Guilty of this Indictment also .

John Williams , of St. Andrew 's Holbourn , was indicted for the Murther of Joseph Hastings , by giving him several mortal Bruises with an Unicorn 's Horn , the 17th of August last , of which Bruises and Wounds he languished till the 28th of the same Month , and then Died . He was likewise indicted a second time , on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the feloniously staying she said Joseph Hastings . John Drew depos 'd , That the Prisoner came into the Skettle-ground , with the Unicorn 's Horn in his Hand , and said to him , Drew , this would knock a Man down of an Hundred a Year ; and the Deceas 'd ( who was the Owner of the Horn ) said to the Prisoner , I desire you would carry my Property where you had it ; and added , that he had been bid more Money for that Horn , than any Man at the Ground had in his Pocket ; that upon this the Prisoner call 'd him fancy Son of a B - h , and told him , he deserved to have his Head broke with it ; to which he reply 'd , if he did , he should pay dear for it ; and then he struck the Deceas 'd with the Horn upon the Stomach , and push 'd him on the Jaw with the End of it , and the Deceas 'd fell down ( as he supposes ) against a stump that was in the Skettle-ground , and afterwards struck up his Heels ; that then the Deceas 'd said , you Son of a B - h what do you do this for , I will make you pay dear for it ; that then he hit him again , and while he was on the Ground , he hit him with the Horn , that then the Horn being taken out of his Hand , he fell a jumping upon him , and kicking him as he lay upon the Ground , upon his Breast , Belly , and Members , giving him a great many Kicks , he knew not how many ; that the Deceas 'd lay with his Eyes shut for about the space of two Minutes . Charles Wentworth depos 'd to the same Purpose as the former Evidence had done , adding , That he had never seen so vile and barbarous a Thing done in his Life ; that afterwards they got the Deceas 'd out of the Ground , and he went away in a very bloody Condition , and shut the Prisoner in , to keep him from following the Deceas 'd ; that he went several times to see the Deceas 'd after , and he always complain 'd that he was very Ill , that he was not able to lift himself up ; that he had been bruis 'd very much , and that he saw him after he was Dead , and found his Head had been broke , and his Head and Face bruis 'd in five places , and that his private Parts were bruis 'd , and look 'd like a piece of Neck-Beef . John Hamilton depos 'd , That he saw the Prisoner bring the Horn into the Skettle-ground , and he ask 'd the Deceas 'd , if he would sell it , and he answer 'd , he would not , and desir 'd him to give him his Horn again , that the Prisoner said , he would not , upon which the Deceas 'd said , he would make him give him his Horn ; whereupon the Prisoner said , he was a fancy Son of a B - h , and if he spoke two Words more he would knock him down with it , and drove the Horn to his Neck , and struck up his Heels , and he fell against a Brick-Wall , that he lay about two Minutes , or two Minutes and a half as if dead , and then open 'd his Eyes , and said , am I to be beat thus by such a Son of a B - h as you ; that then the Prisoner flew to him , and then the People of the House came out of the House , and took the Horn from him , and then he kick 'd the Deceas 'd on the Belly and Stomach . The Deceas'd 's Wife depos 'd , That when her Husband went out that Day , he was in perfect Health , as ever he was in his Life to her Knowledge ; that he came Home in a sad Condition , violently bruis 'd and bloody ; that he always complain 'd of his Head , and his Stomach , and always imputed his Illness to the Injury he had receiv 'd from the Prisoner , and to nothing else ; that his Head was broke , the Mark of a Foot on his Face , and a Bruise the side of his Neck and Throat . Mrs. Waller depos 'd , That she look 'd after the Deceas 'd in his Illness , and he was much Bruis 'd , and continually cry 'd out of his Head and his Stomach , and said , the Prisoner had kill 'd him . James Waller depos 'd , That he being a Neighbour , visited the Deceas 'd , and he said to him , that if he did Die , he should Die of the Wounds the Prisoner had given him . Mr. Smith , a Surgeon , depos 'd , That he being order 'd by the Parish to attend the Canoner , he view 'd the Body , and he really believ 'd the Contusions the Deceas 'd had received on the Head , Back , Stomach , and Scrotum , were the Cause of his Death , and that he was present when his Body was open 'd , and one of the Surgeons putting his Hand under the Bowels , took out a handful of Blood . - Hastings , the Deceased 's Brother , depos 'd , That he going to see the Deceas 'd , he said , he was not able to draw his Breath , nor could not lie in his Bed for a violent Pain in his Breast , and desired him to take up the Prisoner , saying , if he Died , he laid his Death to him , for that he had still 'd him by the Kicks and what he had given him on the Stomach , and other Places . The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded , That the Beginning of August he had an Ague , that going to drink a Pint of Beer , he met with a Friend , and he advis 'd him to drink a Pint of Geneva , and seeing the Horn , he took it into his Hand , and went into the Skettle-Ground , and ask 'd the Deceas 'd , what he would have for it ? That he answer 'd him , It was worth more Money than he had in his Pocket . That he bid him three Pence for it , that thereupon the Deceas 'd damn 'd him several times , and call 'd him Son of a Bitch , and lifted up his Hand with the Bowl in order to throw it at him , and he pushing him off , he fell down against the stump , and broke his Head ; to prove which he call 'd the following Evidences . Robert Linsey depos 'd , That the Deceas 'd came into the Ground with the Horn in his Hand , and some old Clothes , and he gave it the Landlord to carry in ; and the Prisoner coming in , took up the Horn , and went into the Ground , and the Deceased said he had been bid for that Horn by Sir Hans Sloane , more Money than any Body in the Ground had in their Pockets ; that the Prisoner thereupon told him he was a fancy old Fellow , and deserv 'd to have his Head broke with it , and if he spoke any more he would break it ; that the Deceas 'd reply 'd , that if he did he should pay dear for it , and he gave him a push , and he fell backwards ; and Mr. Morris came in , and the Prisoner striking at the Deceas 'd , Mr. Morris warded off the Blow ; that the Prisoner did kick at Mr. Morris , that he did strike up the Deceased 's Heels , and that the cut on his Head was by the Fall . Thomas Morris depos 'd , That he being in the Kitchen , and hearing a Scuffle , went into the Skettle-ground , and the Deceas 'd was sitting with his Back against a Wall , and said , D - n you , you scoundrel Son of a Bitch , I will make you pay for this , and that Williams went to him with the Horn , and made an offer to strike ; but he caught hold of the Horn , and the Prisoner push 'd him against his Father , and he fell down on the Deceas 'd , and tho ' he did kick , he did not see him kick the Deceas 'd . Richard Buckley , the Apothecary , depos 'd , that he was sent for to the Deceas 'd on the 27th of August , and made him up a Cephalick Medicine , and a purging Draught . This Evidence being ask 'd , what he thought might be the Cause of his Death ? he reply 'd , It was probable it might be an Apoplexy . He being ask 'd , How he found the Scrotum ? reply 'd , It was something discolour 'd . Noah Sherwood depos 'd , That he inspected the Body , and found a Wound an Inch in length on the Hinder-part of the Head , but there was no Fracture on the Skull ; that he saw 'd it off , and found it in a good Condition : That as to the Scrotum , the Deceas 'd had a Rapture , and by the Gut being so long , it must have come down some time , and he did not perceive any Contusion there ; that as to the Contusions on his Jaw and elsewhere , they were all so slight , he did not think they were the Cause of his Death . Henry Hildip depos 'd , That as to the Contusions on his lower Jaw , and on the Collar Bone , and Scrotum , and as to the Wound on his Head , it had not affected the Membrane that inclos 'd the Skull , and there was no Fracture , they were all slight , and he did not apprehend that any of them were the Cause of his Death , that the reason of the Pain in his Stomach , might proceed from his Lungs , adhering to the Pleura , which it did , and as to the Blood which Mr. Sherwood took out towards his Back , under his Bowels , it proceeded from the Spleen , which broke in the Operation , rather than from any Contusion in the Back , which was but slight . The Prisoner call 'd some Evidences who depos 'd , That they had seen the Deceas 'd abroad after the Injury had been receiv 'd ; and after a full hearing of the Matter , the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . William Read , of St. Dunstan 's Stepney , was indicted for assaulting James Tew , putting him in fear of his Life , and taking from him 12 s. in Money , the 6th of July last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That he having been at Ratcliff to receive 40l . as he was coming to London over Stepney-Fields , he happened upon the Prisoner and two others , and one of them pretended he had lost 4l . and another that he had won half a Crown , of which another laid claim to 15 d. and they agreed to toss up which should have the whole half Crown , and would have him to hold it the mean time ; that he reply 'd , he was going towards London , and they walk 'd with him , and the Prisoner pulled out a Pack of Cards , and was for cutting for Wagers ; that one of them said his Chance should be under 4 , and another said he would not play under 2 Guineas ; that they importun 'd him to cut , that he refus 'd , saying , he had no Money ; that then they said he should lay down his Ring , that he not consenting , the Prisoner said he had Money , and Money he would have ; whereupon he gave him 4 s. that this did not content him , but he reply 'd , he had more Money , and if he did not give it him , they would take it by Violence , and no Body being near him to assist him , he did give him 8 or 9 s. more ; that he afterwards met him in Pater-Noster-Row , and charg 'd the Prisoner , but he ran away , but being pursued , was apprehended in St. Martin's-le-Grand , and would have given him the 12 s. to let him go . The Prisoner pleaded in his Defence , That he had won the 12 s. of the Prosecutor , and and that the Prosecutor when he apprehended him , threatened , that if he did not give him the Money he had won of him at Gaming , he would swear a Robbery against him . Miles Rivet depos 'd , That when the Prisoner was apprehended , the Prosecutor said , give me the Money you have cheated me of at Gaming , and I have no more to say to you ; and if you do not , I will prosecute you , and swear a Robbery against you ; and after a full hearing of the Matter , the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . John Dawson was indicted for feloniously Forging a Promissory Note of 30 l. the 10 the of August last was Twelve-months ; which Note was given to John Walgrave , by Benjamin Clements , payable five Months after Date . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That he having lent one Benjamin Clements 100l . he not having Money to pay him , gave him a Promissory Note to get discounted , telling him , he would pay him the Discount ; that he selling into the Company of the Prisoner , and he pretending to be a Man in good Circumstances , he did speak to him about getting a Note discounted for him ; that the Prisoner coming afterwards to his ( the Prosecutor 's ) Lodging , at Mrs. Poplet 's , they having Din 'd together , and the Note lying upon his Buroe , the Prisoner went away on a sudden , took the Note without his Consent , Knowledge , or Privity , and did discount it , converting the Money to his own use , and ever since absconded . That the Prisoner had the Note , and did Discount it , and convert the Money to his own use , was fully proved by several Evidences ; not did the Prisoner himself deny it , but pleaded , that the Prosecutor did give him the Note to get it Discounted for him , and did Indorse it to him , and call 'd one Mary-Wild to prove it . Mary Wild depos 'd , That she lodg 'd at one Mr. West 's , and she had often seen the Prisoner and Prosecutor together , that they din 'd together , and had a Bowl of Punch , and she carrying it up , was desired to sit down with them , and there the Prosecutor told the Prisoner , that he had a Note of one Clement 's a Parson , and ask 'd him to get it discounted for him , and that the Prisoner said he would get it discounted for him in a Week 's time , and desir 'd that Mr. West might Indorse it as well as the Prosecutor , and he could get it discounted the sooner ; that both the Prosecutor and Mr. West did Indorse it , and the Prosecutor did deliver it to the Prisoner with his own Hand . In answer to this , the Prosecutor depos 'd , That he did not deliver it to the Prisoner , but the Note was stolen from off his Buroe , in the House of Anne Poplet . And as for this Evidence , Mary Wild , who depos 'd , that she had seen him and the Prisoner together several times , and that he gave the Prisoner the Note at one Mr. West 's , it was all false , nor had he ever seen her in his Life ; but upon the whole the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . Margaret Eaton , alias Irish Peg , of St. Botolph 's Aldgate , was indicted for assaulting John Cooper on the Highway , putting him in fear of his Life , and privately taking a Silver Watch , value 5 l. from the Person of the said John Cooper , the 12th of this Instant October . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That as he was going along the Minories , a Woman ask 'd him to give her something to pay for her Lodging , that he went along , and stopp 'd to make Water , and the Woman came to him , and two Men , and threaten 'd , if he did not deliver his Money , & c. he was a dead Man ; and that they run him up into an Alley , and while they stood threatening him , the Woman rifled him of his Money and his Watch ; but he could not Swear the Prisoner was the Woman , but he did believe she was the Woman . Thomas Clark , the Watchman , depos 'd , That the Prosecutor came to the Watch-House at Tower-Hill , and said , he was Robbed of his Watch ; and they stopping several Persons that came by the Watch-House , the Prosecutor staid in the Watch-House all Night , and a Person coming by , and saying , he had seen Irish Peg have a Watch to dispose of , and that she had sold it for 20 s. at one Plummer 's in Rosemary-Lane ; that thereupon they went thither , and found the Watch , which Plummer depos 'd the Prisoner had left with him for 19 s. and 6 d.
