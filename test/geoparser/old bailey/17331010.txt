George Cave , and John Turner , were indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , value 5l . the Goods of Thomas Sawkins , in his House , October 4 . Thomas Sawkins . I keep the Horse-Shoe and Magpye Alehouse , the Corner of Fetter-Lane , in Fleet-Street , I did not see the Prisoners till my Servant cry 'd out , A Thief ! John Thomas had got hold of the Prisoner Cave , whom he charg 'd with taking my Tankard , and desir 'd me to take care of him , while he went after the other Prisoner , Turner , who was run backwards . John Thomas . About 9 at Night , the Prisoners came to my Master 's House , and going into the back Yard ; they call 'd for a Tankard of Beer . It being , as I thought , too cold to sit in the Yard , I ask 'd them , If they would not go into a Room ? But they said , No ; and so I carry 'd a Silver Tankard to them in the Yard , and was going to fill a Pint for another Customer ; but was not got down more than three or four of the Cellar Stairs , when I heard a Noise in the Passage , upon which I step 'd up again , and found the Prisoner Cave there ; he was going out , but had stumbled in the Dark against some Tobacco-Boxes which were in the Passage . I stopp 'd him for the Reckoning , as thinking he was going off without paying . He said , he had not paid , but his Friend was behind . My fellow Servant , Will Cleaver , call 'd to me , and said , May be he has got the Tankard ! Upon which , I ask 'd Cave , What he had got under his Coat ? He said , Nothing ; but feeling about him , I found the Tankard , and call 'd my Master to take care of him , while I went to secure the other Prisoner , Turner , who was endeavouring to get away backwards , for we have a back Door into Fetter-Lane , but it happen 'd to be fast ; and so I seiz 'd him , and brought him to my Master , who ask 'd him , why he went to run away ? And he said , he was afraid of Trouble ; but that he had no Acquaintance with Cave , any farther than that he had seen him once before , at Reading-Fair , and met him again accidentally , and so came to drink with him . Cave . I went to the Cellar-Head , to deliver the Tankard safe to the Man that brought it to us ; and desir 'd him to give me Change for the Reckoning . J. Thomas . He was got two Yards beyond the Cellar-Head , and instead of offering to deliver the Tankard , he deny 'd that he had it when I charged him with it . Turner . I had seen Cave once at Reading-Fair , and meeting him again by Temple-Bar , we went to drink together , and the Tankard being empty , he said he 'd take care and deliver it to the Man we had it from . I knew nothing but that he was an honest Man , and therefore thought he intended to do as he said . The Jury acquitted Turner , and found Cave Guilty to the value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 3.

Abraham Rayner , was indicted for stealing 20 the Money of Abraham Munford , Sept. 14 Ann Munford * . The Prisoner and I were three Years Prisoners in Newgate together for Debt , and so we became acquainted . I had indicted Ann Ashby , for assaulting me , and her Father and another met me , and the Prisoner , at the Cross-Keys by Hicks's-Hall , in order to make it up . The Matter was to be referr 'd to the Prisoner , who pretended to be my Friend , and that he would take nothing of me for his Trouble . Mr. Ashby , or his Friend , paid me down 20s . on the Table I laid my Hand upon it , and while I was signing the Release , the Prisoner swept the Money all into his Hand , and ran away with it immediately . I found him a little while after in Hicks's-Hall , and ask 'd him for my Money , and he said , I should have it by and by ; but afterwards he said , he had got it , and would keep it . * See the Trial of Ann Munford , below . Court . Did not he Solicit for you ? Ann Munford . No ; he only acted as my Friend , and did not demand any thing . Prisoner . As Ann Ashby lived in Surry , she could not be taken without a Judge 's Warrant , or a Certificate , and did not I take out a Certificate for you at my own Charge ? Ann Munford . No ; you went with me to beg it of the Clerk of the Peace , who gave it me gracious , because I was poor , and had been so long in Newgate for 130 l. Prisoner . But did not I tell the Clerk to set it down to me ? Munford . No , you neither paid for it nor undertook to pay for it . Elizabeth Cracker confirm 'd the Evidence of Ann Munford Prisoner . My Bill , for what I did for Ann Munford , came to 4 s. 10 d. in part of which Bill , the 20 s. was paid to me , and not to her . Thomas Patter . I went with Mr. Ashby to the Cross Keys , to end the Difference by twixt Mr Ashby 's Daughter , and Ann Munford . After some time it was agreed to pay 20 s. which I laid down for Mr. Ashby . The Prisoner was her Attorney , and I paid the Money to him towards his Charges in the Prosecution , but I did not let him have it till she had sign 'd the Release , and then I laid it on the Table , and he took it up . She told me his Bill was 2 l. 8 s. 10 d. and that the 20 s. would not pay half his Cost . I told her 't was no Matter for that , for it was a vile Prosecution . She made no Objection against the Prisoner 's receiving the Money , and he stay 'd about a Quarter of an Hour after he had taken it , and then he was call 'd out by a Man from Hicks's-Hall . This was confirm 'd by the Deposition of Mr. Ashby . Mr. Gibon 's , an Attorney , and John Ellnor , depos 'd , that they had known the Prisoner several Years , and that he bore an honest Character . The Jury acquitted him . 7. Frances Deacon , was indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the Murder of her Female Bastard Infant , by throwing it into a Pond , where it was drowned , Sept. 14 . Mary Jones . Between 9 and 10 in the Morning , I was sent for to Mrs. Frazier 's , in Barnet , to search the Prisoner . I found she had had a Child , and she own 'd it and that she had drop 'd it in a Pond , by the Green-Man at Barnet . She said , she was an Irish-woman , and was going to her own Country , and being taken ill by the Pond-side , she could go no farther ; but leaning against the Rails , the Child came from her , and fell into the Pond , and that she was so weak with an Ague and Fever that she could not call for Help . I saw the Child , it was a Female , very fair and clear , and without any Marks of Violence , and , I believe , with proper Help it might have been born alive . Ann Stiles . Coming by the Pond I saw the Child lying in the Water , and the Prisoner was at the Pond-side at the same Time , but I was so surprised that I asked her no Questions . William Pickersgill . I came by the Pond about 7 in the Morning , just when the Thing was done ; the Prisoner told me and others , that she had dropt her Child in . I got a Rake and drew it out , and there was a small Piece of Hay clenched in its Hand . Justinian Moss , Surgeon . About 8 in the Morning I saw the Child at Mrs. Frazier 's , it had no Marks of Violence . The Prisoner said , that when she first came to the Pond she was taken with Labour-Pains , and was taken with such a Fit that she lost her Senses , and if she had not held by the Rail , she must have fallen into the Pond herself ; at which Time , she said , the Child dropt from her . It fell down a Slope two Foot deep , and might be killed by the Fall . She told me , her Husband died in Kent 6 Weeks ago . Prisoner . Coming by the Pond , very sick and weak , I was taken with a Fit , and took hold of the Post , and the Child dropt from me . I was going to my Friends in Ireland , and did not expect to be brought to Bed till a Fortnight after Michaelmas . My Husband died in Harvest-time at Kings-Down in Kent , where he was buried .

VI . p. 164. John Gearing . The Prisoner is the same Man who was convicted here in July was a Twelvemonth , of stealing Goods and Money in my House , to the value of 39 s. Then the Record of his Conviction , and the Order for his Transportation , were read in Court . Court . Here is Evidence of his Conviction , and the Order for his being Transported , but do you know that he was carried on board , or delivered to the Care of the Merchant who was to Transport him ? Gearing . I heard he was delivered to Mr . Forward , but I ca n't swear it on my own Knowledge . Court . Can any of those swear it who had the Care of seeing him put on board ? Mr. Nichols . In October last we delivered 152 Prisoners on board Mr . Forward 's Ship ; Mr . Forward gave us a Receipt for them , and I remember the Prisoner 's Name was one of them ; but among so many , I ca n't take upon me to swear positively to this Man 's Face in particular . Mr. Alstone deposed to the same Effect , and the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 10.

I followed her close , and asked her for my Box ; she said , if I 'd let her tye up her Petticoats she 'd give it me ; but when she had done , she said she had not got it . Tho Norman . I saw him run after her ; she dodged him round a Coach , and hid herself in a little Passage . She at first said , he wanted her to return the half Crown he had given her ; but afterwards she said she 'd give him his Box when she had ty 'd up her Coats . Prisoner . He met me in Holborn , and offered me a Shilling to go into a House of Office with him , but I refused . Then he asked me to drink a Dram , and took me into a dark Turning against the King's-Head in Chancery-lane , where he let down his Breeches , and bid me take up my Coats and fit in his Lap , and because I would not humour him , he charged me with the Robbery , and run after me and tore my Clothes to Pieces ; but there was another Woman with us in the dark Alley .

Going over Tower-Wharf in order to take Water , about 7 at Night , I saw the Prisoner sitting upon a great Stone ; she got up and said , How do you do , my Dear ? - I do n't know you , says I . No ? says she , but I know you ; wo n't you make me drink ? No , I ca n't stay now , says I , for I am going over the Water , and besides , I have no Half-pence . But I know better , says she , for you have got two Pence in your Hand to pay the Boat-man ; and with that she took hold of my Coat , and I gave her the 2 Pence to get rid of her , not thinking of my Lace , which was in my Coat-pocket , and so we parted ; but when I came to the Water-side I miss 'd the Lace , and enquired of the Watermen if they had not seen such a Woman about the Wharf ? I happened to find a Woman something like her the same Night , and took her up ; but when I came to see her next Morning , I found she was the wrong Person , and so I discharged her . Upon farther Enquiry , I heard of one of the Prisoner 's Comrades , Sarah Whittle + , who had pawned the Lace . I took her up , and she was committed to New Prison , and next Day I took the Prisoner and carried her before the Justices in the Tower , where she said , that I had lain with her , and owned that she took the Lace out of my Pocket , because , as she said , she was not well paid for her Trouble , and therefore would pay herself . + Sarah Whittle , alias Wheatly , was indicted in Feb 1731-2 , for receiving a Silk-Scarf , the Goods of Edward Prior , Clerk , who was robb 'd that and other Things , by Thomas Edwards , James Tripland and Thomas Passe , she knowing it to have been stollen , but was acquitted . See Sessions Paper for that Year , Numb . 1.1 page 89 .

VII . Part 2. page 215 . Margaret Jefferson . One Night there comes Sarah Whittle and the Prisoner to Our House , next to the King 's Head in Rag-Fair , and says the prisoner , Will you buy some Lace ? I got it of a Chap who promised me 3 Pence to lye with me ; but afterwards , having no Money , he gave me this Lace : But nobody buy_ing it , she said to Sarah Whittle , If you 'll pawn it for me , I 'll satisfy you ; so Whittle pawn 'd it to Ann Garner for 16s . and fetch 'd it out next Day , and then I went with Whittle to Mr. Smith 's at the Cheese and Pump in Rag-Fair ; and says I , Will you lend Sarah Whittle a Guinea upon this Lace ? No , says he , I 'll lend her nothing upon her own Ac_count , if she was going to Tyburn ; but I 'll lend 20s.upon your account ; and so he did . But the Day after this , the Lace was blown about and the Prosecutor came to me , and I told him all that I knew of the Matter . Ann Garner . Sarah Beach [ alias Whittle ] who is now in New Prison , pledged this Lace with me for 16 s. James Conyers . I was on the Guard at the Tower that Night the Lace was lost , and next Morning the Prisoner came to me , and enquired for her Husband , Mr. Bull , and said , she 'd go and fill his Stomach : Soldier , says she , I have made a good Hand of it , for I met with a Cull last Night , who - for 3 Pence , and while he was at Work I put my Hand down , and nail 'd a Prize , and pawn 'd it for 16 s. But she did not say what Prize it was . Tho . Inkle , Constable . I found the Prisoner in the Tower , and told her I had got a Warrant against her . Damn you , and your Warrant too , says she , The Ground is the King 's , and - is my own . The Cull would - for 2 Pence , and so I hit him . Mary Gilling . When the Prisoner was brought before the Justices at the Tower , she said that the Cull pulled off his Coat , and laid it under her , and bargained to lye with her for 3 Pence , but afterwards he would not pay her , and so she thought fit to pay herself . Mary Breese . The Prosecutor told me that the Creature took hold of him , and said , Do , my Dear , give me 2 Pence for a Night 's Lodging . That he told her he had but 8 d. and then she took him by the Shirt , and would not let him go till he gave her 2 d. and that when he parted from her he miss 'd his Lace . - She owned at the Tower Court , that he agreed to give her 3 d. to lye with her ; but when he had done , he would give her but 2 d. and therefore she thought proper to pay herself . John Smith . I lent Jefferson 20 s. on the Lace , and she told me , she came by it honestly . Prisoner . The Prosecutor asked me where I was going ? I told him , where I could fare best , and stay longest . Will you go with me then ? says he . I do n't care if I do , says I . But , says he , as I have but 2 Pennyworth of Half-pence , I 'll leave this Lace in your Hands till I go and get Change . So he gave me the Lace , and not returning according to his Promise , I went home , and next Day got Sarah Whittle to pawn it . I wish you 'd enquire how he came by this Lace ; for he 's one that deals in Run-Goods , and I do n't believe it ever paid Custom . The Jury found her Guilty . Death . 22. Francis Crotchet , was indicted for assaulting Sarah Banks , Widow , on the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her an Agate Box with Gold Rims , value 8 l. a Silk Purse , half a Guinea , and 2 d.

October 1 . Mrs. Banks . On the first of October , about a quarter past 4 in the Afternoon , as I and my Daughter were going from Bond-street towards Chelsea , we were met on the Road by Buckingham-wall , a little beyond Hyde-park , by a Highwayman in a Half-mask : He stopt the Horses , and rode up to the Chariot-side with a Pistol in his Hand , and bid us deliver our Watches , Rings , Snuff-boxes and Purses , and swore by his Maker he would shoot us dead that Moment if we did not deliver immediately . I told him I had no Watch , but I gave him my Agate Snuff-box set in Gold , and my Purse , in which were a half Guinea and a Silver Two-pence . I do n't know that the Prisoner is the Man , for I did not see his Face . Mrs. Clifton . I was in the Coach with my Mother , when , between Hyde-park Corner and the Turn-pike at Buckingham-wall , we were stopt by a Man in a Mask ; he bid us deliver , and took from me a Gold Watch with a Gold Chain , an Agate Seal set in Gold , and a red Silk Purse , with some Silver in it , but I ca n't say how much . Jeffery Orson . I was behind the Chariot , and on Monday in the Afternoon , between Hyde-park Corner and Pimlico Turn-pike ; on a sudden I heard somebody call out to the Coachman to stop , and looking behind me , I saw a Man mask 'd , with a Pistol in his Hand ; he rode up to the Chariot Door and said , Ladies , your Money in a Minute , or I 'll shoot you dead , for it 's a Case of Necessity , and no Time is to be lost - Your Watches , Rings , and Snuff-boxes . Mrs. Banks told him she had no Watch , and soon after I saw him take a Gold Watch out of the Coach , and then turning his Horse , he said , your Servant Ladies ; and shaking his Head and Pistol at me , as he went off , he swore if I turn 'd back he 'd shoot me dead . Court . Do you know who he was ? Orson . The very Prisoner . Court . How do you know that ? Orson . I am certain he 's the Man , for when he was gone about 100 Yards , I got down and pursu 'd him a-Foot . I ran faster than he rode , and when I came within 20 Yards of him , his Hat and Mask fell off . He turn 'd back his Horse , and I had a full View of his Face . He turn 'd again towards Piccadilly ; I follow 'd him thro ' May-Fair , by the Course of the People , but before I came to Charing-Cross , I lost him , and the People were at a Stand , and did not know which way he was gone . I enquired of several , if they had seen a Man without a Hat , on a Bay Horse , and in the Hay-Market , I heard , he had left his Horse , and taken Coach , and one Solomon Clark told me , that one John Bunch , who belong 'd to the Reading Coach , knew the Man . Clark and I went to the Bolt and Tun-Inn , in Fleet-Street , where the Reading Coach put up , and there we found Bunch . Says Clark to Bunch , The Man you saw riding without a Hat , has robb 'd a Coach , and you said , you knew where he liv 'd ? Yes , very well , says Bunch , I have known him several Years - And do you think you can take him ? - Yes . So we went together to Temple-Bar , and then , they said , they 'd proceed no farther , except I was absent , for they were afraid he would know me , and they told me , they 'd give me notice when to come again . So I went home ; they sent me word , the same Night , that they had seen him , and desired me to come down to Temple -Bar . I acquainted my Master with it , and he , and a Friend of his went with me to an Alehouse in the Butcher-Row . We sent to Clark and Bunch , and Clark came , and said , they had decoy 'd him into a Brandy-Shop . I went back with Clark , and we brought the Prisoner to my Master . The Prisoner fell on his Knees , and begg 'd my Master to have Mercy on him , and said , he was the Man who robb 'd the Coach . My Master ask 'd him , where the Things were ? He said , At home , and he 'd fetch 'em . My Master sent us with him : Clark and Bunch went in with him , and I waited at the Door . In a little Time they came down , and we all went to my Master . The Prisoner pull 'd out the Gold Watch , the Snuff Box , and 5 s. 6 d. in Money , and laid them on the Table . He fell on his Knees again , and begg 'd Pardon , and Bunch and Clark desir 'd Pardon for him too . My Master said , he could not do that , for if he did , he should be liable to be prosecuted himself . Then we went in a Coach , to a Tavern by Golden-Square , where my Master left us , and return 'd with Justice Lambert , who order 'd the Prisoner to be Hand-cuffed . The Prisoner fell in a great Agony , like one distracted , and stampt , and swore , that if he had a Pistol he 'd shoot himself , and that he was sorry he had not brought one . Solomon Clark . Coming to Town , from Hounslow , in the Reading Coach , at the End of Balton-Street , I saw a Man , riding up the Street , without a Hat . The People follow 'd , and cry 'd , Stop Highwayman ! I jumpt out of the Coach , but he past me and rode up Arlington-Street , and at the End of St. James's-street I lost him . Says John Bunch ( who was with me in the Coach ) I know him , he 's a Fishmonger at Temple-bar , and if you bear any more of the Robbery you may find me at the Bolt and Tun . I goes along Piccadilly , and stopt at the End of the Hay-market to drink , when John Orson came and enquir 'd after the Man without a Hat , who , he said , had robb 'd his Ladies . I told him I knew one who knew that Man , and so we went to Bunch , who came with us , and shew 'd us the House . I bid Orson go home , and told him , I 'd send him Word as soon as we wanted him : He went away . Bunch and I waited about the Prisoner 's Door for his coming home . It was near two Hours before he came , and then he went in , stay 'd about a Quarter of an Hour , and came out again , and went towards the Temple . We follow 'd at a little Distance , and he return 'd in 5 or 6 Minutes . Then I went into the Shop , and cheapen 'd some Herrings ; and after some Talk about 'em , I ask 'd him how he came to lose his Hat ? For God 's Sake , says he , hold your Tongue , or I am a dead Man I told him , he must go with me , and so we and Bunch went to a Brandy-Shop , where we had nine penn'orth of Punch . I ask 'd the Prisoner , what was become of the Gold watch , Snuff-box , and 2 Purses , that he took from the two Ladies ? He said , he took but one Purse , which was a Red one , with 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. he could not tell which , and he had that and the Watch and Snuff-Box at home , and would go and fetch them . While we were there , the Porter , whom I had sent to Orson , came back , and told us , the Gentleman was come to an Alehouse in the Butcher-Row ; we all went thither . The Prisoner fell on his Knees , and ask 'd the Gentleman 's Pardon . Bunch , and I , and Orson went thence , with the Prisoner , to his House . He went up two pair of Stairs , brought down the Watch , Box , and Purse , carry 'd them to the Alehouse , and laid them , and 5 s. 6 d. on the Table - I know him to be the Man I had seen riding without his Hat . J Bunch . Coming towards the Town , in the Reading Coach ( which sometimes I drive ) I saw the Prisoner come riding by , betwixt Kensington and Knightsbridge , I pop 'd my Head out of the Coach , and said , How do you do , Master ? For I knew him when he was 'Prentice . How do you do ? How do you do ? says he , and rid along . At Porter-Street End , in Piccadilly , I saw him come shooting out without a Hat , and twenty People after him , crying , Highwayman ! I stopt at the White-Bear , in Piccadilly , and then went to the Bolt and Tun , in Fleet-Street , where , as soon as I had taken my Horses off , Orson and Clark came to me , and ask 'd me to shew them the House . I went with them , we took the Prisoner , and carry 'd him to the Gentleman . He confess 'd the Fact , return 'd the Watch , Snuff-box , Purse , and 5 s. 6 d. and fell on his Knees and begg 'd Pardon . Prisoner . This was my first Fact , and the greatest Necessity drove me to it . I owed to much Money , that I was almost distracted . I had not the right Use of my Senses , and was about to shoot myself ; but , at last , I thought it was better to take this unfortunate Way , which I find , too late , instead of relieving me from my former Misfortunes , has plunged me into greater . I have a great many Neighbours here to give an Account of my Character before I committed this one desperate Action . Court . The Court would by no Means prevent you from offering any Thing that might be of Advantage to you ; but as the Fact has been so plainly proved , and you , yourself , have confess 'd it , your former Character can not avail you in this Place , where the Law must take its Course , tho ' it may have its Influence elsewhere . The King is the Fountain of Mercy , and he will extend it to proper Objects , and therefore I know not any Way so likely for your Friends to do you Service , as to represent your Case in a Petition to his Majesty . The Jury found him Guilty . Death 23. Edmond Bourk , of the Parish of Christ-Church , in Spittle-Fields , Weaver , was indicted ( on the Statute made in the 2d Year of His present Majesty ) for that he , being a Person of ill Fame , and dishonest Conversation , and wickedly contriving to Defraud Ann Shelly , Widow , and divers others of His Majesty 's Subjects , on the 19th of June , 1733 . of his own Head and Imagination , wickedly , fraudulently , and feloniously Forged , and caused to be Forged , a certain Writing , or promissory Note , in these Words , We jointly and separately promise to pay Mr. Edmond Bourk , or Order , the Sum of Four Thousand Pounds , ten Months after Date , for Value receiv 'd ; as Witness our Hands , Ann Shelly , Ann Shelly , Decemb . 27 . 1731 .

It may be proper to inform the Jury , that an Action was brought by the Prisoner , ( who was their Plaintiff ) for this Note . The Trial was at Guild-Hall . A Defence was made , Council were heard , and Witnesses examin 'd ; but on the Prisoner 's giving it up , there was no Verdict , but only a Nonsuit . And there being Cause to suspect that the Note was forged , the Court order 'd the Prisoner to be committed to Newgate , bound the Defendants to prosecute , and Mr. Billingsly , to whose Care the Note was deliver 'd , to produce it here . If the Facts appear in this Court , as they did in that , I believe the Jury will have no Difficulty to find the Prisoner guilty ; but as the Statute has made the Offence he stands charged with , Capital , I shall not attempt to aggravate it . If my Instructions are right , the Prisoner carry 'd on the Trade of a Weaver , in Spittle-Fields , tho ' it seems he did not so much follow that , as the Business of a Fortune-Hunter . He did not affect to be over-nice in his Choice , Young or Old was much at one with him , if the Lady had but Money . He kept a Gentlewoman in his House , who was sometimes taken for his Wife , sometimes pass 'd for his Niece , and sometimes for his House-keeper only ; and accordingly , she wet by several Names , Mrs. Bourk , Mrs. Dugdale , or Mrs. Puget . This Wife , or Niece , or Maid , or what you please to call her , was one who was very well qualify 'd to start Game for him , for she was a Woman of Address and Art : And hearing that Mrs. Shelly , a Widow Gentlewoman , and her Daughter , who lived at Lawton in Essex , were considerable Fortunes , she went down thither , took a House in the Neighbourhood , and in a little time became not only acquainted , but very intimate , with them both . Having thus far succeeded , the next thing was to bring her Cousin ( as she called the Prisoner ) acquainted with them too . A Scheme was soon laid , pursuant to which he goes down to inform her , that a great Estate was fallen to her , and that she ought to empower some Person to get it in . He carry 'd a Power with him , but this must be Witness 'd by two Persons of Credit , and who so proper as her new Acquaintance Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter ? and they accordingly are sent for , to sign their Names as Witnesses . At this Interview , the Prisoner fell passionately in Love with the - Mother - or Daughter - he hardly knew which , for some time , though at last , I think , he made Choice of the young Lady . Frequent Visits were paid , and received , till Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter discover 'd , his Intention , and then they forbid him and his Cousin to come there any more . The Prisoner , however , comforted himself with this , that if he could not have the Daughter , he would have her Fortune . When he had got their Names sign 'd to the Paper I just now mentioned , it was no difficult Matter to add a promissory Note for 4000 l. You know the Names of Witnesses to a Writing , are sign 'd on the left Side , near the Margin , under the Words Seal 'd and Deliver 'd . Now it is but opening the Sheet thus - and you have the whole Breadth of one half Sheet , and the Margin of the other , to write what you please to the Names : That the Prisoner took this Method , appears to me very plain ; we have his Note in Court . In all Modern Paper there is some Mark in the Middle of the half Sheet , by which , the Maker , and the Time when made , is known ; you will see by the Note itself , that this Mark is not in the Middle of it , but much farther from that End , where the Names are signed , than from the other ; whence it 's evident , that the Length of the Note is considerably more than the Breadth ; of the half Sheet , which I need not tell you , is very unusual ; you will see , that the upper Part of this Note , near the End where the Names are sign 'd , is not cut strait , but indented , and you will judge whether this was not done to prevent any part of the Writing above , from appearing on the Face of the Note . Our Indictment is laid two Ways , for forging this Note , and for publishing it , knowing it to be Forged , False , and Counterfeit . If Names are sign 'd for any Purpose , and a Man shall cut the Names from the first Purpose , and then write a promissory Note to those Names , with an Intention to defraud any Person , this I take to be Forgery within the Statute , as much , as if he had Counterfeited the Names . However , as 't is a Moot Point , I shall rather insist upon his publishing the Note , knowing it to be forged . I believe it will be admitted , that the Note was all of his Writing , except the Names of Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter . 2d King 's Council . And if 't is admitted that the Names were sign 'd by Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter , yet if this was done on another Occasion , and the Names were afterwards cut off , and a promissory Note writ over them , I believe , his Lordship will tell you , that this is Forgery - You may observe one thing more on the Face of the Note : By its being indented and rounded off , on this Side , there was a Difficulty to bring in the Words , As Witness our Hands , for they were forced to put , As Witness , lower than our Hands ; so that you would naturally read it , Our Hands as Witness . Then there is something so peculiar to the Prisoner , in the Writing and Spelling , that it would not be easy to find any Body else to Write and Spell like it . Court . Before you proceed to Evidence let the Act be read . Clerk reads . If any Person , after the 29th of June 1729 , shall falsly make , forge , counterfeit , or cause or procure to be falsly made , forged , or counterfeited , or willingly act or assist in the false making , forging , or counterfeiting any Deed , Will , Testament , Bond , Writing-Obligatory , Bill of Exchange , promissory Note for Payment of Money , Indorsement or Assignment of any Bill of Exchange , or promissory Note for Payment of Money , or any Acquittance or Receipt , either for Money or Goods , with Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever ; or shall utter or publish as true , any false , forged , or counterfeited Deed , Will , Testament , Bond , Writing-Obligatory , Bill of Exchange , promissory Note for Payment of Money , Indorsement or Assignment of any Bill of Exchange , or promissory Note for Payment of Money , or any Acquittance or Receipt , either for Money or Goods , with Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever , knowing the same to be false , forged , or counterfeited , then every such Person , being thereof lawfully convicted , shall be deemed guilty of Felony , and suffer Death as a Felon , without Benefit of Clergy . Mr. Billingsly . I was Associate to my Lord Raymond . On the 19th of June last there was a Tryal at Guildhall , in which the Prisoner was Plaintiff , and Ann Shelly Defendant . On the Issue , this Note was produced by the Prisoner , and read in Evidence ; he stood at the Elbow of his Attorney and instructed him . Prisoner 's Council . We admit the Body of the Note to be the Prisoner 's writing . King 's Council . But we should have it from the Prisoner himself - or we 'll prove it ; shew him the Note . Prisoner . The Body of this Note is my Hand , and signing is theirs . King 's Council . We admit the Names Ann Shelly , and Ann Shelly , to be writ by Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter . Court . Then read the Note . Clerk reads . We jointly and separately - Prisoner 's Council . If you please , Sir , to read it as it is spelt , that I may compare it . Clerkreads . Wce ( with 2 e 's ) J , o , h , n , t , l , y , and s , u , p , p , e , r , r , e , a , l , l , y promise to pay Mr. Edmond Bourk , or order , the sum of four thousand pounds ; ten ( with 2 n 's ) Months after date for value rece , a , ved , Desember ( with an s ) 27 1731 ( in Figures ) as Wittness ( with two t 's ) our bands , Ann Shelly , Ann Shelly . King 's Council . Call Ann Shelly and Ann Gowen - Mrs. Gowen , whose Maiden Name was Ann Shelly , is the young Lady whose Name is to that Note . Prisoner . I except against them as Witnesses , as the Note is in Chancery , and they are to swear it off - I beg my Council may speak to the Point . Then the Prisoner 's Council producing several Cases , in which interested Persons were not allowed to be Witnesses ( which we have not Room to insert ) and the King 's Council not insisting on this Point , Ann Shelly and Ann Gowen were not admitted to be sworn . King 's Council . Much of our Evidence will arise on the Face of the Note . Tho Ridge , Stationer . I was desired to inspect the Note . I presently saw it was longer than a half Sheet . We call this Kind of Paper a Fool's-Cap , because it was formerly marked with a Fool 's -Cap in the Middle of the half Sheet , but now it has different Marks , according to the Province it 's made in . This the Note is writ on has the Arms of Amsterdam . It never has more than 9 Wires on a Side , but this Note has II Wires , and the Arms is not in the Middle ; whence I am certain that this is 2 luches longer than the Breadth of a half Sheet , and , I believe , it was cut from some Writing which these Persons were Witnesses to ; and the rather because it is indented , which looks as if it was done to keep clear of some Writing that was over it - and here 's a piece of Paper pasted on to make it appear even . Besides , I never saw , in the Course of my Trade , a Note of so extravagant a Length . Prisoner . Did you ever see a Letter of Attorney with Witness our Hands , at Bottom , instead of Signed , sealed , and delivered ? Mr. Ridge . I did not say it was a Letter of Attorney , or any thing else in particular , but that the indenting looked as if it was done to avoid some Writing that might have been over it . Prisoner . Could it not have been cut from the back of a Letter ? King 's Council . The Question is not from what Paper the Names were cut , but if they were not cut from sme Paper , to which they had been affixed ; and if you cut can from a Letter , 't is all one to us . Prisoner 's Council . We have so many Witnesses to give an Account how we came by the Note , that all you can bring against us will do you but little Service . King 's Council . Then they were imported since the Trial at Guildhall - 'T is pity you did not bring all your Forces in an Action for 4000 l. - Call Martha Todd - Do you remember any thing of Mrs. Shelly 's paying the Prisoner any Money ? Martha Todd the Younger . Yes ; 't was last May was Twelvemonth . I do n't know how much it was ; but she asked him if she owed him any thing else , and he said , No . Prisoner 's Council . That might be , for the Note was not given 'till December following . Robert Jenning . I have known the Prisoner between 5 and 6 Years ; I lived with him as Book-keeper at the Time of the Date of this Note ; and about that Time I saw several Notes of his Writing , from 100 l. to 5000 l. payable to him from Ann Shelly . King 's Council . Did he give them you to enter in his Ledger ? R. Jenning . No ; they lay about the Counter and Warehouse as Waste-paper . King 's Council . What , Notes of such Value ? Are you sure he wrote them ? R. Jenning . Yes ; for I have seen him write often ; I was with him 17 Months constantly - I think there was one Note for 6000 l. - They run thus ; I promise to pay to Mr. Edmond Bourk , or Order , so much Money for Value received , as witness my Hand , Ann Shelly . King 's Council . Was Ann Shelly writ in his Hand too ? R. Jenning . Yes . King 's Council . And did you never ask for what Purpose he wrote these Notes ? R. Jenning . I asked him no Questions about them ; he might do it for his Diversion , or to practise his Hand . Indeed I have heard him say , that he would have all the Widow ( Shelly 's ) . Money from her - That he had courted the Daughter , but would have the Mother now , because she had most Money . King 's Council . Pray what was his general Character ? R. Jenning . His Character in general was indifferent , but I never heard any thing of this Kind before . Prisoner 's Council . Did you never see any Warrants of Attorney to receive Money for Mrs. Shelly ? R. Jenning . No . Prisoner 's Council . Did not he receive Money for them , and do their Business ? R. Jenning . I ca n't say . Prisoner 's Council . Was not he acquainted with the Family several Years ? R. Jenning . He was for some Time ; but I ca n't say how long . Prisoner 's Council . Did not he turn you away ? R. Jenning . I left him when his Business failed . Prisoner 's Council . Was it not because he would keep you no longer ? Did not he discharge you ? R. Jenning . Yes ; but not in any Disgust . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . I had some Acquaintance in the Town where Mrs. Shelly lived , and with her among the rest . I was about to be married to a young Lady at Highgate , which Mrs. Shelly hearing of , came to my House , and after some Discourse she told me , her Daughter was not every One 's Money , and if I made Suit to her , I should be very well received . I went that Night , and was kindly entertained , from which Time we grew very intimate ; and Mrs. Shelly , the Mother , had so good an Opinion of me , that she told me I should take my Choice , either to be her Son or her Husband . I constantly visited them , at least three times a Week , and they came as often to my House ; and if any Time I happened to neglect going at the usual Time , the Mother would come and tell me her Daughter was Sick . When I continued this Course for about a Year and a half , the Neighbours told me that Mrs. Shelly was a cunning old Woman , and bid me take Care of what I did , and so I press 'd her to bring Things to a Conclusion . Atlast it was agreed that I should marry her Daughter , and thereupon she gave me this Note for 4000 l. as a Security for her Daughter 's Fortune . I was so far from imposing upon her , that I told her when I first came to London I had but 4 s. 6 d. in the World , and what I had got since was all by my own Industry ; and so far from making a Secret of this Note , which I should have done if I had forged it , that I shewed it to Mrs. Todd as soon as I had it , and told all the Neighbours that I had got Miss Shelly 's Fortune , and I have said the same before Company in Mrs. Shelly 's hearing , and she has never contradicted it . This was in December , 1731 , and in February following Mrs. Shelly told me , as I was a Tradesman , if I should meet with any Misfortunes her Daughter would have nothing to trust to , therefore she would agree to pay me 1000 l. in part of the 4000 l. before it became due , in order to purchase a Security of 50 l. a Year for her Daughter 's Jointure ; and accordingly , an Agreement was put into Writing , and signed by her and two Witnesses for that Purpose . The Marriage was to be on Easter Sunday following , and I was to have the 1000 l. next Day . Against the Time appointed the Wedding Cloaths were bought , and I went down with a Ring and a Licence ; when Mrs. Shelly told me her Daughter was not to be seen ; I was surprized at this , and desired to know the Meaning of it . Mrs. Shelly said it was much against her Will ; she was sorry for it , but could not help it , for she fear 'd there was a Snake in the Grass , and that her Daughter was either married , or very near being married to her Carter , Philip Gowen . I asked her what was to be done , and she bid me , and William Yates , who was with me , go to Philip Gowen , and tell him he would be mistaken by marrying her Daughter to get her Fortune , for that she made it all over to me , and that I would lay him in Goal . We went accordingly , but it was to no Purpose - and afterwards Mrs. Shelly offer 'd me 1000 l. to deliver up the Note , and quit my Pretensions . Prisoner 's Council . We have here the Agreement sign 'd by Mrs. Shelly , but Isaac Dakins , one of the Witnesses , is dead , and Michael Dolphin , the other , is not to be found . We apprehend he has been sent out of the way , for after the strictest Search , we can not find him ; but however , we shall call Witnesses to prove that this Paper was witnessed by them . Martha Dakins . My Father , Isaac Dakins , dyed last Shrove-Tuesday . Prisoner 's Council . Look on that Paper ? Do you believe that Name to be your Father 's Writing ? Martha Dakins . Yes , I believe this to be his Hand - and he told me , on Valentine's-Day , that he had set his Hand to a Paper between Mrs. Shelly and the Prisoner . William Ray . I had a Subpoena Ticket to subpaena Michael Dolphin , and I carried it to Booth-street , and enquired for him ; I heard he had been there , but was gone . Mr. Cole . I made strict Enquiry after Dolphin in Spittle-fields , and Duke-street , by Lincoln's-Inn-fields , which I was told were likely Places to hear of him , but I could not find him , and was informed he was gone to Bristol ; upon which I published an Advertisement in the Daily Advertiser of June 28 , 1733 , which I have hear to produce . Jane Davock . This Name is Michael Dolphin 's Hand-writing . Court . Let the Paper be read . Clerk reads . February 14 , 1731 . Whereas a Marriage-Contract has been between my Daughter Ann Shelly and Edmond Bourk , in December last , whereupon the Portion is secured to him by Note , bearing Date December 27 , 1731 , for 4000 l. and whereas no Settlement being made on my Daughter , it is farther agreed between the said Edmond Bourk and me , that he is to settle 50 l. a Year on my Daughter and her Ears ( Heirs - I suppose it should be ) - for ever ; and I do farther agree to pay , on Easter Monday next , 1000 l. to the said Edmond Bourk for that Use , out of the above-mentioned Fortune , tho ' not yet due 'till October next ; and - if 't is wanted in Trade , to let him have such Sums as he shall want 'till the said Note becomes due . Signed in the Presence of Ann Shelly , Isaac Dakins , Michael Dolphin . King 's Council . By the Learning of the Note , this Agreement seems to have been drawn up by the same Hand , but they ha n't proved that Mrs. Shelly signed it . Prisoner 's Council . No ; we have only proved the Hands of the Witnesses - but that is sufficient . Jonathan Parker . I live at Lowton-Hall , and rent between 3 and 400 l. a Year ; Mrs. Shelly is my Neighbour ; the Prisoner frequently came to visit her and her Daughter , for about a Year and a half - I know nothing of the Marriage-Contract , nor ever saw him and the Daughter together , but the Mother and he were so intimate that nobody could be more , except Man and Wife , and they were the common Talk of the Neighbourhood . He used to call her Mother , and I heard him tell her , that he began the World very hard , and brought but 4s . 6d . to Town with him , and that what he got since was by his own Industry . Prisoner . Did not she seem pleased when I called her Mother ? Parker . Yes , mightily . Prisoner . Did not I publish all over the Town that I had her Daughter 's Fortune ? Parker . Yes ; and you shewed me the Note - but I am no Schollard . King 's Council . Did you ever see Mrs. - what d 'ye call her , Mrs. Dugdale , or Mrs. Paget , there ? Parker . Yes , once . William Yates . There was great Intimacy and Familiarity betwixt the Prisoner and Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter , for 9 Months together . King 's Council . What ! did he court them both ? Yates . I ca n't say as to that ; I never saw nothing but modest and honourable Virtue between them . Prisoner 's Council . Look upon these two Letters - Do you know Mrs. Shelly 's Hand-writing ? Yates . Yes ; I have seen her write twice , and I believe these to be all the old Gentlewoman 's writing . Clerk reads . Numb . 1 . For Mr. Bourk in Booth-Street , near Spittle-fields , Brick-lane . Sir , I beg the Favour of you to step up to the - Inn , for I ca n't come to you to Day , because I am obliged to go out of Town , Ann Shelly , March 4 , 1732 . Reads , Numb . 2 . Jan. 10 . 1731 . Sir , I have been to enquire after the Tenant 's Name , and his Wife says , her Husband 's Name is James Hows , and he holds but Part , and Martin holds the other Part - so I desire you to put in but 4 Acres . - King 's Council . You need not produce these Letters to prove an Intimacy betwixt them - We admit it , and that he was to have had her . Daughter , 'till she heard his Character . Prisoner 's Council . Yes ; and they prove farther , that she empowered him to transact Business for her . Prisoner . Did not she desire you to go with me to Philip Gowen , who married her Daughter , and to tell him , that her Daughter 's Fortune was in my Hands ? Yates . The Prisoner wanted to see Miss , and the old Gentlewoman said , she was not at home , and was afraid there was a Snake in the Grass ; and that she was married , or going to be married , to her Man Philip Gowen , and desired me to go with him and see for Gowen at the Church , and to tell him that her Daughter 's Fortune was all in the Prisoner 's Hands ; and that if he did not desist , the Prisoner would lay him in Goal . We went and found Gowen at Farmer Nichols 's House , about half a Mile off . What do you want ? says the Farmer . Why , says the Prisoner , I understand that Gowen is about to marry Miss Shelly , and if he do n't desist I 'll throw him in Chelmsford Goal , and there he shall lye and rot . You put him in Goal ! says the Farmer , by what Authority ? Why , says the Prisoner , I have a Note for all her Fortune and more , under her and her Mother 's Hands . Ay ! says the Farmer , for how much must that be ? For 4000 l. says the Prisoner . This was in March or April , 1732 . Prisoner . And I offered Gowen to produce the Note to their own Attorney . Yates . And when we returned to Mrs. Shelly , we told her what we had done , and she seemed very well pleased . King 's Council . Did you tell her , that the Prisoner told Gowen he had a Note of 4000 l. Yates . No ; we only said in general Terms , that we had obey 'd her Commands . King 's Council . Mrs. Shelly might send such a Message to frighten Gowen from marrying her Daughter , tho ' she had never given any such Note to the Prisoner - But did you give this Account at Guildhall ? Yates . Partly I did . King 's Council . How far did you go - Have a Care - for we remember it - we have it in writing . Yates . I gave an Account as far as our going to Church to find Gowen , and then the Court said , there was no Occasion for my going any farther , and I might stand down . King 's Council . How so ? Were not the Plaintiff 's Council admitted to ask Questions ? Yates . I do n't know ; the Court silenc 'd me . King 's Council . Who do you mean by the Court ? Yates . It must be the Judge or the Council . King 's Council . So the Council against you bid you go down , and his own Council agreed to it - Where do you live ? - What Countryman are you ? Yates . I live in Spittle-fields - I am a Brewer - and an Irishman , but I can give a good Account of myself . King 's Council . We shall do it for you by and by . Nicholas French . I am a Merchant in Addle-street , Aldermanbury . In March , 1731-2 , I went down with Mr. Risden to his House in Essex . The Prisoner hearing of our intended Journey , desired us to dine with him , at Mrs. Shelly 's . We accordingly called , and were received in the Yard by the Prisoner and Yates . They put up our Horses , and then the Prisoner went with us to the Door , where we met Mrs. Shelly . The Prisoner introduced us to her as his Mother . Going into the House , the Daughter appear 'd and he told us , she was his Wife . King 's Council . But that was more than Fact . Mr. French . By the Freedom I saw between them , I thought they were marry 'd ; but at Dinner , some Body ask 'd When the Wedding was to be ? And it was answer 'd , On Easter-Sunday next . Indeed by the Prisoner 's Behaviour , I could not tell which he had most Desire to , the Mother or the Daughter . King 's Council . Was you at the Trial at Guild-Hall ? French . I was not called . King 's Council . What Countryman are you ? French . An Irishman . King 's Council . I know not why they call these Witnesses to prove an Intimacy , when we admitted all this an Hour ago . This is the way to make a Cause eternal . Mr. Risden . I am a Mercer in St. Martin 's . I din 'd at Mrs. Shelly 's - I have a Country-house about seven Miles farther - King 's Council . Was you examin 'd at Guild-Hall ? Risden . No . King 's Council . I suppose you can say nothing more than the last Witness ? Risden . No . - Todd . I am a Farmer at Lowton . As for hearing any Discourse about Matrimony , on the 3d of May was a 12 Month , there was a common Talk about the Parish , and my Wife was uneasy when she heard that Mrs. Shelly had sign 'd Writings , and so I went to Mrs. Shelly in the Cow-house , and said , i had heard she had sign 'd Writings , and she desir 'd me to take no Notice , for she knew what she had sign 'd , because she had read it before she set her Hand to it ; but for my part , I never saw Scrip nor Scrawl . King 's Council . Did she say any express Words of a Note of 4000 l. or that her Daughter had sign 'd any Writings ? Todd . No . Mr. Dicks . Last Easter was a 12 Month , I went down with the Prisoner to claim his Wife , Mrs. Shelly gave us a Dram ; the Prisoner ask 'd her if Mrs. Ann was within ? She said there had been some Difference betwixt her and her Daughter , who kept out of the Way , which she herself was not the Occasion of ; but was very sorry that the Prisoner had been at the Trouble and Charge of coming down so often , and would make him any Satisfaction , if he 'd deliver up the Writings . Then he produced a Note of some Agreement of 50 l. a Year , to be settled on Mrs. Ann , and another Note of 4000 l. and the Wedding-ring , and the Licence ; she desir 'd him to be easy , and said , she did not care if she gave him 4 or 500 l. if he 'd deliver up her Note . No , says he , I wo n't take 1000 l. but I 'll put the Note in Force . King 's Council . Did you read those Papers ? Dicks . I did not take much Notice of them - he laid three on the Table . King 's Council . What shape was the Note ? Dicks . A long slip of Paper ; I think it was sign 'd by both Ann Shelly 's - I do n't remember the Substance of the third Paper . King 's Council . Where were you at the last Trial ? Dicks . In Leicestershire - At Wickston-Two-Steeples , two Miles from Leicester - I have a small Estate there , of about 30 l. a Year . Christopher Bews . At the End of April , 1732 , I went to the Prisoner 's House , in Booth-Street , Spittle-Fields , and found Mrs. Shelly , the Mother , with him . He was walking about very much dissatisfied , and said he had been ill us 'd , and she talked very low , and assur 'd him it was none of her Contrivance . There was a Gentleman , one Mr. O Brian , and he read a Paper of 50 l. to be settled on Ann Shelly ; and something of a Note of 4000 l. to be paid sometime afterwards by Mrs. Shelly , and Mrs. Shelly said , she had rather give him 1000 l. than have any farther Dispute with him about the Note . King 's Council . Did you read the Note yourself ? Bews . No ; I ca n't read . Court . It appears plain , that Mrs. Shelly never deny 'd the Note , that she was highly concern 'd her Daughter had behav 'd in such a Manner , and that she was willing to make Satisfaction . The Evidence against the Prisoner , is only Circumstantial . There 's some Suspicion on the Face of the Note ; but that is for from being sufficient to convict a Man of Forgery - I do n't say the Note is Recoverable for there being no Value receiv 'd , perhaps a Court of Equity , may not allow it . The Council open 'd that Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter witnessed a Letter of Attorney ; but not one Person has been called to prove it - King 's Council . I do n't know what they have done with the Witnesses , I have a great many more in my Brief - where is Martha Todd , the Elder ? - What pass 'd betwixt you and Yates ? Martha Todd . Last May , was twelve Months , I told him , I had heard , he was to be one of the Prisoner 's Witnesses ; and he said , No ; he knew nothing of their Affairs , and never saw Scrip nor Scrawl - I saw him again , when the Prisoner was committed to Newgate , and ask 'd him , If he remember 'd what he had said ? And he answer 'd as before . Court . He might say so , perhaps he was not willing to disclose their Affairs to her . Martha Todd . I was at Mrs. Shelly 's , when Yates said to the Prisoner , If I was courting a Lady , I 'd bring down a Licence , and say , Madam , I must and will have you ; and Mrs. Shelly said , I deny that with both my Hands . Elizabeth Gowers . I liv 'd at Mrs. Shelly 's , before the Prisoner first came - He lit of them at Midsummer-Fair , and so came to see them , on the Foot of Courtship to Mrs. Ann ; but she made a Rejectment , and said she would never have any thing to say to him that way ; and to my Knowledge , she continu 'd in the same Mind all along , from his first coming to his last . Court . Had she any Lover ? Gowers . Yes ; Mr. Sexton ; the Prisoner reduced him to her , as he told me next Day , and said , he should have got me to a ' spoke a good Word for him - and sometime afterwards , he said , I see Miss wo n't accept of Mr. Sexton , no more than of me . King 's Council . They have call 'd Witnesses we were not aware of - We were prepar 'd for the Witnesses he brought to Guild-Hall ; but now he has got quite a new Set , except Yates - and the Agreement is a Piece of Evidence that they did not produce before . Court . That might be their Ignorance . King 's Council . As we are depriv 'd of the Evidence of Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter , 't is impossible to prove the Forgery if Circumstances are not allow 'd as Evidence , and I think the Circumstances appear very strong on the Face of the Note - Yates is the only Person we are prepar 'd for , and therefore we can only attack his Character . The rest , as we know nothing of them , we must leave to the Jury . Mr. Powel , What do you know of Yates ? - Nay , do n't shake your Head , but speak . Benjamin Powell . Yates is my Neighbour - I have known him four or five Years - I have heard of ill Tricks - but - [ Shakes his Head . ] King 's Council . Out with it , Man . Powell . I do n't love to meddle with my Neighbours . King 's Council . Do you think he would take a false Oath ? Powell . I ca n't say what a Man would do . King 's Council . If you were upon a Jury , would you give Credit to his Evidence ? Powell . Do n't ask me to instruct the Jury . Thomas Farvis . I have known Yates three Years - He is an Irishman , and has the Character of most of his Countrymen - a very bad Character in general - He is supposed to to have a Club of them , that will do and say any thing . John Franks . Yates keeps a Brew-house and Tap-house , he has a very indifferent Character . Prisoner . I have a great many Witnesses to my Character . Court . If you call Witnesses on one Hand , they may call on the other . King 's Council . Ay we shall Counter-ballance them . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 24 , 25 , 26. John Weedon , Joseph Cox , and John Buttler , of Hendon , were indicted for assaulting John Partridge , on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a red Coat , a Hat , a crape Hatband Handkerchief , half a Guinea , 45 s. and 3 d . October 8 . John Partridge . In my Way from London to Watford , as I was riding up Red-Hill ( which is a little on this Side Edgworth ) I saw the Prisoners coming down ; it was a clear Moon light Night , between 7 and 8 a Clock . They spread themselves a-cross the Way , and Weedon ( the Soldier ) took old of my Horse 's Bridle , and led me down , and the other two went one on each Side . When we came to the Gate , at the Bottom of the Hill , by the Meadow Side , they nhors 'd me . Butler put his Hand in my Pocket , and took out my Purse with my Money in it , and then unbuttoning my Breeches , shook the Wristband , and ask 'd me , if I had any more ? I said , No ; but searching farther , he found 2 or 3 penn'orth of Ha'pence , upon which he gave me a great Slap o ' the Face , for saying I had no more . Weedon then led me about 60 Poles , sheer a-cross the Meadow , to the farther Side , behind a Hedge . There Weedon and Butler , who , I think , had Pistols , took off my Great-Coat , and laid it for me to sit on . I thank 'd them , and then they ty 'd my Hands and left me , but soon turn 'd back , and Cox felt of my Hat , and saying it would fit him took it from me , and ty 'd my Legs too . Then one of them took away my great Coat , and telling me it I shirr 'd before they brought me more Company , they 'd shoot me thro ' the Head ; they went away again . However , I made shift to slip my Hands loose , and went to the Crane at Edgworth , where I told Mr. Russel my Case ; some Justices were sitting at that House , and they sent in search of the Prisoners , who were found at the White-Lion , in Edgworth . They were brought to me in about an Hour and a Half . I knew Cox at the first Sight , but was not so positive to the other two immediately , tho ' upon Recollection , I was positive to them likewise , the same Night . Weedon was not then in his Regimental Clothes , and Cox , I remember , in particular , when they had ty 'd my Hands , wanted to cut the String to take my Clothes off , and leave me naked . Weedon . What Clothes had I on ? Partridge . Brown . Weedon . It 's well known I have won nothing but red to s several M Butler . He clear 'd me before the Justice that Night . Partridge . I said at first Sight , I did not know him , but I recollected him in less than an Hour , tho ' indeed I did not say so at that time , for I did not think it proper , because no Body ask 'd me the Question . James Brown . About 7 a Clock , the same Night the Prosecutor was robb 'd , I saw the three Prisoners go by the Hill as I was going down . I had known Cox and Butler many Years , but I did not know Weedon . - Pope . I am Servant at the Crane at Edgworth . The Prosecutor came in about 8 at Night , and complain 'd he had been robb 'd by three Men . I was sent to the Constable 's House ( the White-Lion ) where Butler and Weedon were drinking . The Constable came , and went back and fetch 'd them all there to the Crane . The Prisoners Defence . Hannah Neal . I live at the White-Lion . The 3 Prisoners came there to drink , about 4 in the Afternoon . Cox went to Bed between 4 and 5 , and between 6 and 7 , Mr . Marshal , a Butcher , came and pulled him out of Bed . He sat by the Fire a Quarter of an Hour , and then went to Bed again . At half an Hour past 7 , as I was going up Stairs , I saw a Light in his Room , upon which I went in to fetch away the Candle , and saw him asleep , and half an Hour afterwards the Officers came and took him out of Bed . The other two were drinking at the same time ; they had been out , and came in again , between 6 and 7 , as I guess , for we have no Clock - but it was about half an Hour before they were taken . John Freshwater . I came home ( to the White-Lion ) from London , between 5 and 6 . Cox was then by the Fire , and in Half or three Quarters of an Hour , he too a Candle and said , he 'd go to Bed . My Maid going up about half an Hour after , came down with his Candle , and said he had left it burning in the Room , and so she brought it away . At about a Quarter past 7 the other two Prisoners came in , and in about Half an Hour more , the Drawer came from the Crane , to tell me , the Justices wanted me . I guess at the Time , because Robert Marshall , who lives in the Town , came in a little before Butler and Weedon , and said his Clock struck 7 , just as he came out of his own House - my House is half a Mile from where the Robbery was committed . Robert Burton . I was drinking with the Prisoners at the Lion , by the Kitchen Fireside , till 7 a Clock that Night ; I guess it was thereabouts - Court . Are you sure they were all three there ? Burton . To the best of my Remembrance ; but I am sure as to Butler and Weedon . Court . Did not they go out at all ? Burton . Yes ; but I am almost sure they returned by half an Hour past 6 , and did not go out again . Court . Was you there your self all the Time ? Burton . I was to-and-again , in-and-out , for I am the Ostler ; but I was most an- end in the Kitchen - The Prisoners bear an honest Character . John Millin . I have known Weedon 15 or 16 Years ; he is a Shoe-maker , works hard , and has made 20 pair of Shoes a Week . Edward Dean . I have known him as long . He has work 'd for me half a Year , and follow 'd his Business as well as any of the Craft in the Country . John Carpenter . He was given to nothing but only to drinking , as another Man may be . The Jury found them all Guilty . Death . 27 , 28. John Brown , otherwise Conway * , otherwise Johnson , and Elizabeth Tracey , were indicted for stealing a Silver Cup , value 25 s . the Property of Margaret La Mothe , Oct 7 . * He was convicted in December , 1731 , by the Name of Terence ConWay , for stealing a Pair of Shoes . See the Sessions -Paper , 1731 , Numb . 1 , p 22 . Brown , Tracey , and another Woman , were seen talking together , in Great St. Andrew's-Street . They parted ; Tracey went into the Prosecutrix 's Shop , and cheapen 'd some Tea , Brown follow 'd ask 'd for a Quarter of an Ounce of Tea , and threw three half Pence on the Counter , and while the Prosecutrix turn 'd about to take down her Scales , he snatch 'd the Cup off the Chimney Piece , and run over the Way into Neal 's Court . The Prosecutrix went to the Door after him , when Tracey took her by the Arm , and told her , he was run the contrary way . A Neighbour , who from an opposite Window saw what pass 'd , call 'd to the Prosecutrix to secure Tracey , which she did ; Brown made his Escape , but being presently after taken up for Coining , and carry 'd before the Justice and searched , the Cup was found upon him . Tracey being carry 'd before the same Justice , and the Prosecutrix describing her Cup , the Justice produc 'd that which was taken from Brown , which prov 'd to be the same she had lost . Tracey was acquitted , and Brown found Guilty . 29. John Brown , otherwise Johnson , otherwise Terence Conway , was a second Time indicted , with Margaret Berry , for High-Treason , in Coining 20 Pieces of false and counterfeit Money , in the Likeness of Six-pences , May 10 . Anthony Macnelly . About nine Months ago , I came from Paris , with a Servant of my Lord Peters - I had been a Month in London , when happening to meet a Friend in the Street , I went to drink with him , at the Muffled-Bear , in Wild-street . The Prisoner , who goes by the Name of Brown , was sitting in the next Box , and call 'd to me by my Name ; I told him , I did not know him : No ! says he , my Name 's Terence Conway . Then I recollected that I had been acquainted with him in Ireland . Having parted with my Friend , the Prisoner carry 'd me to the Bull-Head , in Prince's-street . There we found the other Prisoner , who was his Acquaintance , and goes by the Name of Berry , but she told me , that her right Name was Mac Evers . Berry . So it was , by my first Husband ; his Name was Patrick Mac Evers . Macnelly . Conway and I play 'd at Shovelboard there , and in the Dusk of the Evening we all three came away together . As we turn 'd into Drury-lane he gave me a Six-pence , whether good or bad I ca n't say , and bid me go to a little Shop there and fetch him a Halfpenny worth of Snuff ; I went and brought him the Snuff and Five-pence Half-penny in Change , at which he laugh 'd ; I asked him what he laugh 'd at ? he would not tell me , but said , Come along . A little farther he gave me another Six-pence to fetch a Penny Brick . I thought it odd he should give me Silver to change , when I knew he had Copper . I gave the Baker 's Maid the Six-pence to change ; she scrupled it , and carry 'd it in to her Master , who came forward and ask 'd me if I gave that to the Maid ? I said , Yes . And have you got any more such about you ? says he . No , says I . And upon that he seiz 'd me , and sent the Maid for a Constable ; but Conway coming in , call 'd for a Penny Brick , laid a Penny down , and push 'd me out , and I ran away ; he follow 'd , and call 'd after me , and so we met again . I was so daunted that he could not persuade me to change any more that Night , but he past off several himself in our Way to his Lodging , which was in Grub-street . When we came thither , he bid me call upon him next Morning , and ask for him by the Name of Brown ; so we parted , and I went to my own Lodging , which was at my Aunt 's in Gardener's-lane , Westminster . Next Morning I call 'd at Mr. Brown 's Lodging ; his Landlady directed me to go up one Pair of Stairs ; I did so , and knock 'd two or three times , but having no Answer , I went down again ; then his Landlady call 'd Mr. Brown , upon which he answer 'd , and came down with the other Prisoner , who goes for his Wife . We drank two or three Quarters of Gin together , and then he bid me take a Walk in Moorfields , and come again in an Hour ; which I did . We went together towards- Piccadilly , and past off several Six- pences that Night ; so I used to go to him every Morning , and we used to go out in the Dusk of the Evening . But as I often staid very late , my Aunt as often checked me for keeping such ill Hours . I told the Prisoners of this , and so it was agreed , that I should lye in the same Bed with him and her , which I did for some Time , and I believe their Landlady knew nothing of it , but thought I still came in the Morning . At last I began to be ashamed of lying with a Man and a Woman at the same Time , and then they got me a Blanket , and I laid by their Bedside , and they were very kind to me . Now I 'll give an Account of what I have seen them do every Morning that I was with them , except Sundays ; he sat down on one side of the Fire , and she on the other ; they put a Fire-shovel on the Fire , with some Metal in it like Pewter , and melted it ; then he took the Shovel and poured the Metal into something , but I ca n't say what , for they would not let me see it . Then they put the Shovel on the Fire again ; he took out a Six-pence , and threw it into an old Hat behind him , and so they did till they had used all the Metal in the Shovel , and made 20 Sixpences , or more , and I have taken them warm out of the Hat . Then both he and she took a Knife and scraped the Edges round , and nicked the Edges of some of them with a File , and afterwards bent them . Court . Did he take out but one Six-pence at a time ? Macnelly . But one ; I asked him to let me see the Thing they made them in , but he would never let me , tho ' he promised me that in time he 'd let me into the Secret , and learn me how to make them . There was a Table in the Room with Chalk or Whiting , and a flannel Waistcoat , and they set me to rub them upon the Table with the Whiting and Flannel , as hard as I could , which I did . We staid 2 Months in Grub-street , and then removed to Morris's-court in Peter's-street , Soho , where we followed the same Trade ; and we always took Care to lock the Door within Side when we were at work . Berry . Did you ever know me to put off any bad Money ? Macnelly . Yes ; many a Time . She had a false Pocket with a private Fob ; I have seen her put 15 or 16 bad Six-pences at a time in one Part , and when I brought her Change she has put that in the other Part . Brown . You make this Information only to get your Discharge from your two Years Imprisonment . Why did not you make your Discovery before you were ordered to be imprisoned ? Macnelly . Brown and I were sent to the Gatehouse for passing this bad Money , and he told me several times there was no Danger , for it was bailable , and we should soon get our Liberty . At Night he was carried before Sir John Gonson , and bailed out . Then I thought to make my Information at Hicks's-Hall , but seeing several of his Friends there , I was afraid they 'd tell him , and so he 'd make his Escape ; so I rather chose to stand my Trial ; and afterwards I sent to Mr. John North , who belongs to the Mint , and made my information . Brown . Did not Mr. North send for you , and promise your Liberty and a Reward ? Macnelly . Mr. North never sent to me , nor had I any Reward , or any Promise from any Body . Mr. North . Brown was bail 'd , but did not appear on his Recognizance . Macnelly was try 'd on the Saturday , and on the Monday following he sent to me , and gave the same Account in Substance as he has done now . I made him no promise of his Liberty , or any Reward , but on the contrary told him , he must not expect any such Things . Brown . Macnelly d has been in the French King 's Service ; he said , when he was in the Compter , that he would swear our Lives away , and hang us , if he lost his soul to Hell . Robert Sexton . I keep a Smith 's Shop at the Top of Grub street ; the Prisoners lodg 'd with me 2 Months , and 't is about 5 Months since they went away . He said he was a Hair-merchant , and had an Estate of 50 l. a Year . They kept their Chamber very close , and sometimes went out . Macnelly came to them almost every Day . After they were gone I found about 2 Ounces of mix 'd Metal ; with which a Man in my Shop made me this Pair of Buckles . Mr. North . As I have been concern 'd in prosecuting several on the like Account , I have seen a great deal of their bad Money , and this Buckle is very much like what they commonly make Use of ; 't is a kind of Block-tin . Mary Story . I clean 'd the Prisoner 's Lodgings at Mrs. Morris 's in Old Soho . - I believe she is President here , and I found a matter of a Pound of this Metal in Consequence , but I gave it away to the Children ; and this Pocket , which I found there too , had a Bit in it . Court . Look on that Pocket , Macnelly ; is that the double Pocket you said the Prisoner wore ? Macnelly . 'T is very like it , but I ca n't positively swear 't is the same . John Wadnell . took this Six-pence out of Brown 's Pocket before the Justice . Mr. North . I believe this is made of the same Metal as the Buckles . Brown . I receiv 'd it for a good one - Berry . And as for Macnelly 's coming to us , my Landlady knows that both I and my Husband desir 'd her to deny us to him . Court . What Husband ? Berry . This is my Husband . Brown . And this is my Wife . Mrs. Sexton . When the Prisoners lodged at my House in Grub-street , this one-ey 'd Man , Macnelly , came to them almost every Morning - There was another Man , indeed , came after them , to whom they desired me to deny them - After they were gone , I found a Piece of Metal , and some Whiting , in the Drawer . Mr. North . When the Prisoners were before the Justice , Brown said she was not his Wife , and she said , he was not her Husband , for she was never married to him in her Life . She said the same in New-Prison , and that she could prove he had coin 'd , but I told her it was then too late . She said Margaret Berry was her maiden Name , and that her Husband , Patrick Mac Evers , was then alive . Court . If she could prove her Marriage to Brown , it would do her no Service ; for in High Treason 't is no Excuse for a Woman , that she acts under the Direction of her Husband . John Stolon , Constable . I took Brown on a Bench Warrant , for uttering bad Money , and I found in his Pocket a Razor , a Pair of Scissors , and this fine File . Macnelly . I believe this is the File that I have seen him use often in nicking the Edges . Brown . I found the File in the Street . Ann Berry . I live at Mrs. Morris 's in St. Anne's-court , ( some call it Morris 's court ) in Peter's-street , Soho ; I was going one Sunday Night , about 4 Months ago , to see for the Prisoners , and by Chance I met this blind Man , Macnelly , near the New Church in the Strand , and asked him if he had seen them ? No , says he , not to Night , but I saw them in the Morning ; and , God damn me , but I 'll be revenged of them both , for I 'll have a better Coat to my Back by this Day s'nnighs . Court . Did he ment on any thing the Prisoners had done to him , for which he would be revenged ? Ann Berry . No , nothing of that , but only damn him he would be revenged on them ; and damn him he would have a better Suit of Clothes . Macnelly . She says this was 4 Months ago , and I have been 5 Months in Consinement . The Jury found the Prisoners both Guilty . Death . 30. John Sherman was indicted for the Murder of John Wiggans , by striking him on the left side of the Head with a Cane , by which he fell to the Ground , and by that Fall received one mortal Wound and Bruise on the Fore part of his Head , Sept. 20 of which Wound he linguished till the 26th of the same Month , and then died . He was a 2d time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for Manslaughter . The Prisoner and the Deceased were at the Tewksbury-Church Alehouse in White-chappel ; they sat in different Boxes ; the Prisoner and his Company were spelling Words , and at last a Tankard of Beer was laid about spelling Plumb ; upon which the Deceased started up , and said , God damn you all for a Parcel of Blockheads , P , l , u , m , b , spells Plumbn Some of the Prisoner 's Company said , what silly Fellow is that , to trouble his Head with us ? The Deceased came to them , and swore he was as good a Man as any of them , and he 'd fight e'er a Man there with a Sick , either for Love or a Tankard of Beer , and at last he would needs sight the Prisoner . The Prisoner declined it , but the Deceased went home , and returned with his Cane , and challenged the Prisoner to go into the Yard . They fought , and broke one another 's Heads . - The Prisoner 's Cane was split . They parted . The Deceased would have t'other Bout . The Prisoner knocked him down , and he fell with his Head upon the Pavement ; he was help 'd up ; they went in ; their Heads were dress 'd ; they drank to one another ; shook Hands ; parted Friends , and the Deceased went home , and not imagining the Wound to be dangerous , neglected to send for a Surgeon till it was too late ; his Skull was fractured , and it proved the Cause of his Death .

Richardson , Smithson , Grace and I , and the Prisoner , met this Gentleman in Lincoln's-Inn-Field , about Midnight ; Grace collar 'd him ; Richardson and Smithson stood , one before , and one behind , to look out ; the Prisoner on one side , and I on the other , searched the Gentleman 's Pockets ; the Prisoner took half a Guinea and 15 d. and Richardson took his Hat , and struck him over the Head , and I had his Wig - And after the Gentleman was gone , one of us said , God damn him , I wish I had stabb 'd him , because he look 'd back .

Court . Where was he the 28th of July at Midnight ? J. Morgan . I ca n't say where he was that particular Night , but I never knew him out so late as 12 a Clock ; I lock my Doors every Night at 10 , and the Key in the Door ; but then my Bed is so near the Door that he could hardly go out without my hearing . John Simmonds . I live in Lombard-Court at the Seven Dials ; from the 1st to the 21st of July , I lodged and worked with the Prisoner at Morgan 's , and in that Time he was hardly ever half an Hour out of my Company ; he kept good Hours ; I saw no Harm by him , and he had a pretty good Character .

Here 's William Jackson , a Prisoner , knows that Watson told him , that I was not concern 'd in this Robbery . William Jackson * . I lay with Watson in New-Prison , and at Night , when we were lock 'd up , he begun , in his usual way , to tell about his Villanies . I ask 'd him , if he ever got any considerable Booty ? and he said , once he could have got 300 l. worth of Plate , if it had not been for Stick-in-the-Mud + , so that he got but 14 l. - Watson was sent to the Jerusalem , to view the Prisoner , and when he came back , I ask 'd him , if he knew the Prisoner ?
