A true NARRATIVE OF THE POCEEDINGS At the Sessiions Holden for London and Middlesex , At Justice-hall in the Old-bayly , The 10th and 11th days of May , 1676 . THe Malefactors Arraigned every month at the Sessions in the Old-bayly , being commonly so numerous , and their Crimes so various , as well as their methods of putting them in practice , so new-invented and unheard-of ; It has been thought convenient from time to time to continue the publication of the Transactions there to the world , that the honest securely innocent may for the future be forearm 'd by requisite caution and the ill disposed , warned to leave off and avoid such subtile and mischievous practices . The Sessions began on Wednesday the 10th of this Instant May , and though it determined the following evening , yet to relate exactly all the Minute circumstances of the Villanies there unravel 'd , would bee too tedious ; we shall therefore give onely a brief , yet most true , and plain account of the most material Passages . Amongst which we must reckon the trial of that much talkt of person charged by common Fame with having Seventeen Wives , though to do him Right it must be acknowledged that he was Indicted only for four , and being Arraigned upon the first , knowing what punctual proof there was prepared both of the Ministers that performed the Ceremony and others , and that if he were found Guilty on that , he should be excluded from the benefit of his Clergy upon the rest that he should be Convicted of , therefore being well tutor 'd in that Skill , which not a fresh man in that University is ignorant of , He very frankly at once pleaded Guilty to that and all other Indictments within the benefit of Clergy , and so prevented all farther disquisition of the circumstances , and we are sorry were are forced to fail the Readers expectations in a Relation which would certainly have been very rare and divertiseing ; But not wholly to disappoint their curiosity we hope we may insert what could gather from the most credible Reports concerning him , which is , that for about five years last past or more he has made it his business to ramble up and down most parts of England pretending himself a person of quality , and assuming the names of good families , and that he had a considerable Estate per Annum , though in Truth he was old sutor ultra Crepidam , a Knight of the Order of the famous Crispin , being originally by profession a Shomaker , and not many years since a Journyman ; but on the pretensions aforesaid , where ever he came if he heard of any rich Maid , or wealthy widow at their own disposal , he would very formally make Love to them , wherein being of handsome taking presence , and Master of a voluble insinuating tongue , he commonly succeeded to engage their easie affections . And having inveigled them to marry him , and for some small time injoy 'd their persons , and got possession of their more beloved Estates , he would march off in Triumph with what ready mony and other portable things of value he could get , to another strange place , and there lay a new plot for a second Adventure , but was at last discovered in the West , and apprehended , and at the great charge of the Prosecutor brought up by Habeas Corpus hither , but however subtilly he behaved himself heretofore , I conceive he fail 'd in his politicks , when being brought to the Bar and demanded what he could say for himself why judgment should not pass upon him , whereas 't is believed he might have had the benefit of the Clergy , he obstinately waived that , and insisted for Transportation , which being not thought convenient to be granted , because he stood charged in the Sheriffs custody with an Action of a thousand pounds , he thereupon received sentence with the rest to be hang 'd . To match him there was another ( though not so famous ) instance of the contrary sex , a woman being indicted for having two husbands at once alive , which being fully proved she was found Guilty , and her sex not being capable of the benefit of the Clergy , was likewise condemned to dye . Another woman was arraigned as accessary to the sacrilegious Robbery of St. Giles 's Church Plate , for which some were executed last Sessions . The witness against her was the same upon whose Testimony ( chiefly ) they were condemned ; who gave evidence that they sold the plate to her , at three shillings eight pence per ounce , and that she paid them for it all in Clipt-mony , for which they forced her to make some further allowance . But it seems she was so cunning , as not to drive the bargain in person , but kept one Chamber , discoursing them in another ; so that they never perfectly saw her , upon which , and some other flaws in the evidence , the Jury were favourable as to acquit her . A Goldsmith was also Arraigned for buying the same Plate , and some Prisoners swore they saw him such a day , pay her part of the mony with an acknowledgment of more satisfied before ; but he making it to appear that he was at that time out of Town , & c. was likewise found not Guilty . There were three very gentile fellows Indicted for Felony and Burglary , stealing plate and monies to a great value , from a Gentleman of good quality in Westminster . They all confessing the Fact , pleaded Guilty , and beg 'd the mercy of the Court , so that there was no farther need of reproof or examination of Circumstances , 't is said they received intimation of the prize , by applying themselves to this Gentleman ( being meer strangers ) on the account of getting a reprieve ( on many faigned Arguments and Allegations ) for some of their Confederates Condemned last Sessions , and then with a most barbarous Ingratitude Robbb 'd him for his Civility . However , they now pretended this was the first Felonious Fact that ever they committed , yet it being confessedly a Burglary , they were justly condemned to dye according to Law . Three women of Stepney were indicted ( one as principal the other two as accessaries ) for stealing Hemp enough to make Halters for all the Rogues in Christendome , that is to say , no less than four thousand weight in one Indictment , and three thousand in another . It beingsuggested that they had got a Key to a Rope-maker s Warehouse , whence at several times they purloyned those vast quantities . But no direct proof appearing , they were all acquitted . A Schoolmaster was arraigned for a Rape or Carnal knowledge of a female Child of about seven or eight years of Age , but upon a Judicious Inquisition into the matter he came off being only found guilty of an Assault commited on her . Two Men and two Women Convicted of several Burglaries and Felonies , being all old and notorious Malefactors , received sentence of Condemnation . A Broker and a Woman that kept an Inn , took their respective Tryals , as accessaries for receiving stoln Goods , but the Witnesses being Prisoners , and thought to charge them out of malice , both were discharged . There were in all nine condemned to dye , five were allowed their Clergy , and burnt in the hand , and six ordered for Transportation . There was a Man some time before the Sessions brought Prisoner to Newgate , on suspition of murthering his Wife , but on examination of the matter , it appearing that he was Innocent , and the Woman a Felo de se , or self-murtheress , the Grand Jury returned the Bill Ignoramus .
