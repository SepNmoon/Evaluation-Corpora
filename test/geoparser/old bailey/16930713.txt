Mr. Hambleton by his Counsel called some Gentlemen , who gave a very regular Account of his former Behaviour , and that he had always the Character of a very firm Protestant about four years ago ; which might be so , yet he might change his mind since ; as the Court directed the Jury .

He was acquitted . John Ludlam was indicted for a Misdemeanor , in publishing a Scandalous Libel , entitled , The Anatomy of a Jacobite , or a Jacobite 's heart laid open .

Recorder at first : he could give no account where he had the Book , therefore in Law he was the Author of it ; he was heard to say , That he intended to set up a Press , which he said he did not intend to use to any ill end , nor to affront the Government .

The first Evidence was one Mrs. Peters , Sister to the said Thomas Peters , who said that the House was broke open in the night-time , and the Goods were taken away ; but they who were there were not satisfied with that , but thirsting after blood too , they murthered the said Thomas Peters , putting Tobacco-pipes and a Stone into his Mouth , and crammed Rags after them , and then they put him under a Feather-bed , and choakt him to death ; the Rags were produced in Court all bloody , & c.

Some of the Goods were brought by Davis to the House of Hamsted in Long-Acre ; and there she said , That the Old Cull was very strong , and he cried out , and that she and one Jacob did it , and that they could have brought as much more if they could have carried it ; and that they had left the Old Cull fast asleep upon a Feather-bed . It was sworn that Hamsted entertained Davis that night after the Robbery and Murther was done , which was very horrid in its nature and circumstances , although she was not indicted for it , that a Woman should be so cruel ; The Prisoner Davis cried and lamented her Case , and denied al the matter of Fact , as did Hamstead ; at the latter end of the Trial Henry Hamsted , Husband to Avis Hamstead , was brought into the Court by his Bail , and the Jury were charged with him , as being accessary to the said Elizabeth Davis ; but none could accuse him , he being in the Countrey at the same time ; so in the end , Davis was found guilty of Felony , and Mrs. Hamsted was found guilty of harbouring and entertaining of her after the Felony committed .
