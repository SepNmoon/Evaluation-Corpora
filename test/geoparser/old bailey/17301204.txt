The Prisoner call 'd some Evidences , who depos 'd , That the Prosecutor said the Person who robbed her was in a light-coloured Coat , and a light Wig ; but this was contradicted both by the Constable , the Justice of the Peace , and others , who affirm 'd , and said it was a Man whose Hair was as Black as the Constable 's , which was pretty Black . After a full hearing of the Matter , the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . Death .

John Neal depos 'd , That upon the 18th of November about Nine o'Clock at Night , he found a Letter in the Passage , which seem 'd to be thrust under the Door , directed to Mr. Marriot ; that this Letter he gave to his Master . The Substance of the Letter was as follows . I am an unfortunate Gentleman , driven to great straits , I desire you to send me three Guineas ; upon your sending I shall not trouble you again , but upon your not sending , I will assure you , I will send to you in another manner . I charge you upon your Peril not to send any Body with the Porter , nor to ask any Questions , but leave it till call 'd for . Direct it to be left at the Magpye Alehouse in Essex-street , for Mr. Ralph Blunt , to be left till call 'd for . Mr. Marriot depos 'd , That he considering what was best to be done , and this being to be sent that same Evening by Six o'Clock , he made up a Pacquet , with 2 or 3 Sheets of Paper , sealed it with three Seals , and sent it by a Porter , and also sent a couple of Porters to sit and drink in the House , and narrowly observe if any Body should come to ask for it , but not hearing any thing till about Nine or Ten o'Clock at Night , he sent his Clerk to fetch it away , and order 'd him to say his Name was Charles Blunt , and that upon his asking for the Pacquet , the People readily delivered it to him ; upon this being satisfied that the People of the House were not privy to the Design , he went there and communicated the Matter to them , and left a Packet there as before , desiring them to secure the Person that should call for it ; the Matter rested Friday , Saturday , and Sunday , and on Monday they brought a Woman to him , who had come to demand this Pacquet , that this was the Prisoner 's Wife , who being ask 'd , If she knew this Ralph Blunt ? answer 'd , she did not , but pretended she came to demand the Pacquet by Virtue of a Letter which came to her Husband ; and being ask 'd , If her Husband had seen or knew of the Letter ? After several Prevarications , she at length own 'd that he had seen it , and that she , her Husband , and her Sister Mrs. Poynter had a Consultation upon the Letter , and that her Husband had come with her to show her the House , and as it afterwards appear 'd , waited for her in St. Clement 's Church-Yard , whilst she went to the Magpye Alehouse to demand the Packet ; but she not coming for a considerable time , he suspecting something had happened , went away , that afterwards Mr. Coward came to the Justice 's , and finding they were for committing the Prisoner 's Wife , he said , he could produce the Prisoner , and went away , and soon brought him to them . Elizabeth Davis depos 'd , That the Letter came to her the 19th of November , that it was brought by a Porter , that she refus 'd to take it , saying , she did not know any such Person as Ralph Blunt , but a Gentleman that sat there , said , take it in Mrs. Davis , it may be it is for some Gentlemen that used the House before you came to it , they having liv 'd there but a little while ; that this was about 6 o'Clock in the Evening , and that about 9 or 10 a Gentleman came for it , saying , his Name was Ralph Blunt ; that afterwards a Pacquet was left again , with Instructions to apprehend the Person who should come to demand it ; that on Monday following a Gentlewoman ( the Prisoner 's Wife ) came to demand it , that she desir 'd her to sit down , her Husband being gone to Market , and having gotten the Key of the Cupboard ( as she pretended ) in the mean time she found an Opportunity to send for a Constable , and giving her a Letter that Mr. Marriot had left , she insisted upon a Parcel , and the Constable coming in , apprehended her ; and she added , that she looking out of her Door , as if she look 'd for her Husband , saw the Prisoner leaning against a Stone-Pillar in St. Clement 's Church-Yard ; and that after she was apprehended , she shew 'd a Letter , by means of which , she said , she call 'd for it ; and John Davis confirm 'd the Evidence of Elizabeth Davis his Wife . The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded , That he liv 'd at the Old Barge-House , and being a Lighterman , his Master , Mr. Rich ; having ordered him to get some Sails mended , he came from Home about Six o'Clock in the Morning , and knew nothing of the Letter , but about Ten o'Clock was inform 'd that there was a Letter sent to him , that upon hearing this he went to Mrs. Poynter 's , his Wife 's Sister , and there met with his Wife , who shew 'd him the Letter , the Contents of which was to go to Mr. Davis 's House to receive a Parcel , and to go to the Rose and Crown at Ratcliffe-Cross , which Letter was sign 'd J . King . That he not knowing from whom it came , nor what to make of it , sometimes thought it might be a present from some Relation in the Country , he said he would go himself , and call for the Parcel , but his Sister Poynter advised him not to appear , left it should be some Trap laid for him , he having been in some Trouble , and having a Law-suit now depending ; so at length he went with her , and staid hard by for some time , but she not coming , he was going away about his Business , but then meeting his Sister Poynter , was inform 'd , that his Wife was in Custody on Account of the Letter ; that upon this he went to Mr. Coward , who was his Attorney , and inform 'd him what had happened to his Wife , and advis 'd with him what to do , and desir 'd him to go to her , and inform himself how the Matter was ; that Mr. Coward advis 'd him to stay at an Alehouse whilst he came to him again , and when Mr. Coward came again , he went very readily to the Justice 's . Mrs. Poynter depos 'd , That the Prisoner 's Wife ( her Sister ) came on the 23d of November to her to the Compting-House in Black-Fryars , and they Breakfasting together , she told her she had received the oddest Letter that she ever saw , and shew 'd it her ; that she said to Mrs. Green , I fancy your Sister or Mother has sent you a Present out of the Country , and has done it by an unknown Hand , that her Husband may n't know of it ; that she sent a Porter to enquire for the Prisoner , and he came , and his Wife shew 'd him the Letter , and he said he would go and fetch the Parcel ; that she ask 'd him , If he knew Ralph Blunt ? He answer 'd , No . That his Wife being in a surprize , he jocosely said , it may be some Body has laid a Bastard Child to me ; that he saying he would go to fetch the Parcel , she advis 'd him not , left it should be a Trap laid for him , he being at Law ; that he went away , and she advis 'd her Sister to go , but they meeting together afterwards , did go both , she to the Magpye in Essex-street , and he to St. Clement 's . Elizabeth Charles depos 'd , Mrs. Green came to her in Water-street about Twelve o'Clock that Day , and told her she had an Estate sell to her , and she knew not from whom , or how , and shew 'd her the Letter , which directed her to go to the Magpye to receive a Parcel and Money . Mr. Coward depos 'd , That the Prisoner came to his House , he being his Attorney concern 'd for him in a Law-Suit about some Lighters , he being then at Mr. Lightbound 's , a Master in Chancery , his Servant came with him thither , then he inform 'd him of what had happen 'd to his Wife , and desired him to go and see what the Matter was , that he did go , bidding the Prisoner stay at an Alehouse till he brought him Word ; that he went to the Justice 's , while she was under Examination , and finding they were for committing the Woman , he went and fetch 'd some of the Prisoner 's Hand-writing , and he went very readily with him to the Justice 's . The Prisoner call 'd a great many Persons to his Reputation ; and after a full hearing of the Matter , the Jury acquitted him .
