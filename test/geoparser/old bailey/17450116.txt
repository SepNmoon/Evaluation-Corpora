Mary Barber . On the 12th of November about four o'clock in the afternoon , I was going by the White Lion Tavern in the Strand , the Prisoner was standing at the door with a blue apron on , and another fellow with him , who had a handkerchief about his neck ; the Prisoner said , Drag that bitch in , I will make her pay for all the bitches that have bilked me ; with that the other man , who is not taken , ( his name is Thomas Long , as a chair-man told me ) laid hold of me ; I said , pray , Sir , let me alone , for I am going about my business ; he took hold of me , and dragged me into the house ( I thought the man of the house [ the Prisoner would take my part , but he did not ) pushed me into the parlour , and locked the door upon me , and said , D - n you , you hitch , if you do not let me do so and so , I 'll murder you ; I said I would not ; for I was in a Christian country , and did not fear getting assistance ; then I rung the bell , and the Prisoner came in , the other fellow said , bring some wine , with that the Prisoner brought a pint of wine , and said , I will make her pay for them if there were a hundred pints ; with that he stripped the pillareen off my neck , and said , D - n you , you bitch , why do n't you let the man do so and so to you ? He had a knobbed stick , and struck me with it ; I cried out murder several times ; he said if I cried out murder any more , he would murder me , for he had got company in the house . - I defended my pillareen as well as I could , till I was so weak , that I had no strength in the world , and have a great many black spots on my body now to shew for it : then he kicked me into the street , and said , D - n you you bitch , I do n't desire to see you any more . Q . Did you cry out murder in the house ? Barber . Yes ; and he kicked me into the street , and I was told he said , I should pay handsomly for it , and I lay sprawling in the street , but no body knew me there , nor nobody came to my assistance . Prisoner 's Council . Was you ever in the house before ? Barber . Never but once , and that was to drink a glass of wine with a gentleman and his wife . Q . What Part of the House was you in when the Prisoner used you so ? Barber . I was in the Parlour next the Street . Q . Do the Windows look into the Street ? Barber . Yes . Q . Was it dusk ? Barber . It was not dark : It was between four and five o'Clock . Q . Why did not you apply to somebody in the Street , to go with you into the House again , and get some Redress ? Barber . Because nobody knew me : I went home afterwards , and then I did go there . Q . Did you ever say you would not have prosecuted this Man , if he would have come down to you ? Barber . I never said so . If there are twenty false Witnesses against me , I ca n't help it . Q . Where did you go after you were out of the House ? Barber . I took a Chair and went home directly , and got a Constable , but the Constable would not go into the House with twelve Constables , and a File of Musqueteers . Q . What Business are you ? Barber . I live in Bell-yard , by Temple-bar . Q. I ask you what Business you are of ? Barber . I kept a Gentleman 's House . Q . What are you now ? Barber . I keep a Gentleman 's House now . - Mr. Mayne 's , in St. Martin's-lane . Q . Do you live there now ? Barber . He is fell under misfortunes , and has left off house-keeping - I work plain-work now . Joshua Brogden . When Barber applied first to Sir Thomas De Veil for a warrant to take up the prisoner , he granted the warrant for assaulting and abusing her , and taking her pillareen , and bound him over for the assault ; but she afterwards indicted him for a felony . Q . What did he say at that time concerning the fact ? Brogden . He said he had the pillareen , but that he took it for the reckoning . Prisoner . I was in the entry , the prosecutrix stopped a man in the street , and I heard her say , come will you give me a glass of wine ; he said , he had no money ; she said , you had as good come in , for it shall cost you nothing : they called for a pint of wine , about half an hour afterwards I went into the town , and the man said , this gentlewoman will pay you the reckoning ; and she saying nothing , I thought she would . When I asked her for it , she said , d - n you , what business have I to pay the reckoning ? and said she would not pay me . I said , madam , you use me very ill , you used me so before , but you shall not use me so now for I will be paid for the wines ; she said she had no money , then she pulled of her pillareen , and said , d - n you take that , I 'll a robbery against you , and have your life for it . Another time a gentleman came with her into the house and paid a shilling for a pint of wine , she took the shilling up and went about her business , and I lost that . Capt . Hopkins . I was at the White Lion Tavern in the Strand the 12th of November with M Wife from three o'clock till about a quarter six , waiting for Capt . Winslow to go to a play - I did not hear any crying out , nor any all ; and if there had been any I believe I should have heard it , for I was in the bar room , pretty near to the room they were in . I have dined there ever since the 12th of April , and never heard any disorder there . Major Wise . I was in company with Capt . Hopkins and Capt . Winslow , and there was no sign of noise at all nor any thing like it : I have used the house these twelve months , and never heard anything disorderly , there are gentlemen of reputation come there frequently . Prosecutor 's Council , to Barnes the constable . Did not you take a couple of gamblers out of the house ? Barnes . There were gamblers frequented the house , but that was three years ago , before the prisoner kept it . Thomas Lee . I have known the prisoner ever since he came to the house . I live next door to him . He is a man of a very good character . And if she had cried out , my men must have heard her , and would have gone to her assistance . William Frasier . I live opposite the prisoner . I have known him ever since he came there , which is about two years . He is a man of a very good character . Jeffery Anwell . I am a next door neighbour to him . He is a man of a very good character ; I do not believe there is an honester man in the world . I have the honour of lodging some gentlemen belonging to the Parliament . And I could not suffer a disorderly house next me . Indeed it was a bad house , and I got the people removed - I have seen the prosecutrix frequently about the streets picking up people . Q . What is her general character ? Anwell . A whore . John Arnold . I have known the prisoner ever since he kept the house , and never heard but that he was a very civil , honest man .

The prisoner is a very worthy man , and bears a very good character - I have seen the prosecutrix walking the streets frequently . Mr. Sharp . The prisoner is a person of a very good character - the prosecutrix has been so impudent as at my own door to offer to pick me up . Thomas Flower . I have known Mary Barber from her infancy . Q . Do you take her to be an honest woman ? Flower . I ca n't tell you her original extraction . I know she was brought up very well , and put to the boarding-school . Q . Do you think she would take a false oath ? Flower . I believe she would not have done so . Q . Do you think she would take a false oath now ? Flower . Really I ca n't say . Mr. Blower . I take Barber to be a very honest girl - I hope she would not take a man 's life away falsely - she kept a house of lodgers about 2 years ago . The last place I knew her at , she kept Mr. Mayne 's house in St. Martin 's Lane - I ca n't brag much of her general character . I have known her 12 years : she has a loose character . Acquitted .

Edward Bagley , ( the constable . ) When I took Brickspear up , she said Colledge owed her 9 d. for washing and making his bed , and that he gave her leave to pawn them , but he said he never did .

It was 20 inches by 14 , which is big enough for almost any person to go through - The greenhouse may be about 40 yards from the dwelling house . The prisoner had a knife about her , with which I believe she cut these things . The gardener said it had the gum of the trees upon it .

On the 12th of this inst . the prisoner came to me with these pails . The man had them in a bag upon his back , and the woman offered them to sell as old copper ; I said , I suspected them to be stolen , and that they were made for the government . She said , she had them from her brother in New-England . I stopped them , and said , if they brought any body to shew they came honestly by them - they should have them again . Q . Why did not you stop the prisoners ? Scotting . I was going on board a ship about some business , and left the prisoners with my man - Dobbings told my man he would go and fetch his landlady to the character of his wife - that she came honestly by them . But before the Justice he denied she was his wife . My man , while I was gone , found out the marks . I went down to Greenwich , and heard that Dobbings had been a pensioner there . And the gentlemen of the hospital sent some people to look at the pails ; and they found they belonged to the hospital . Charles Sparkes . I am servant to Mr. Scotting . Holmes offered them for 10 d. per pound , and said she had two of them every year from New-England , and had sold that sort ten years . Dobbings said they had no marks upon them . But after they were gone , I found the marks ; and by my master 's order , when they came again , I stopped them . Sarah Green , and Ann Jewers , ( two of the nurses ) Proved the pails were in the Hospital on Friday night , and missing on Saturday morning , that they were marked G R Greenwich . Stephen Stonystreet , ( the Steward 's clerk ) Produced the King 's stamp , and it fitted with the mark on the pails . Dobbings . I went with Holmes to sell them ; she told me she had them from her brother in New-England . I knew no better . I did not know there was any mark upon them . Q . Are you any relation to this woman ? Dobbings . She is not my wife . Holmes . On the Saturday morning between one and two he went out with a bag , and said he was going to move some goods . He came home between 5 and 6 with these pails . I asked him how he came by them ; he sa id he had them by chance . He made me go with him to sell them , and bid me say I had them from my brother , or he would knock my brains out - I was married to him at the fleet . Dobbings . Indeed I am not married to her , this is my wife . [ Dobbings 's wife fell down on her knees , and begged for her husband , and said , I am his lawful wife , she is a common whore and has been the ruin of our family . ] Holmes .

About 20 minutes after 12 o ' clock , between the 22d and 23d of December as I was going along the Strand , by Northumberland house , the prisoner met me , and said , where are you going , my dear ; I said , what is that to you , you bitch . Then a man came either behind me or on one side of me , and laid hold of my collar ; as soon as I found that , I struck at him , then another man came up and they pulled me down backward upon a step , held me by the throat , and asked me what business I had to call the woman bitch . Then the prisoner unbuttoned my breeches , and turned every pocket the wrong side out , and took a guinea out of my right fob . But there was one six-pence left , which happened to stick in the corner of one of my pockets . As she was unbuttoning my breeches , I took hold of her by the coat with my right hand . Q . Did the men offer to hold your hands ? Humphreys . No , they left my hands at liberty . Q . What did you do after you got hold of her coat ? Humphreys . Then I rose up . Q . How long was she doing this ? Humphreys . I believe she was about a minute , she was very dextrous . Then the men went off , and one of them struck at me with a stick about two foot and a half long . When I got up , I took her by the hand and she called for assistance . Then one of the men came and struck at me . I struck at him , and brought him down - I had hold of the prisoner all the time . While I was down upon my back , she said , d - n him , kill him , he squeaks . Then Thomas Ind and Benjamin Meadows came to my assistance , and the men got off . Q . Was it a dark night ? Humphreys . Yes . Q . Are you sure that the Prisoner 's hand was in your pocket ? Humphreys . Yes ; because no body was by but the Prisoner and the two men , and I am sure neither of their hands were in my pocket , and I kept hold of her all the time till we got her to the watch-house ; she would not speak one word before the Justice . Q . Where did you receive that guinea ? Humphreys . Mr. Mildmay in Strutton Street paid it me about four hours before for carrying him . Prisoner . I was by myself : was there any men along with me ? Humphreys . I did not see any man till after you had laid hold of me . Prisoner . He asked me to drink , and said , he would give me a shilling to have some conversation with me : I said , I did not come out upon that account , but he persuaded me , and gave me the guinea instead of a shilling , or else I should hardly have kept it in my pocket till next morning . Humphreys . I did not say any thing to her but what I mentioned before - I did not give her the guinea , I never offered her any money , or promised her any . Prisoner . Was not you in liquor ? Humphreys . I was as sober then as ever I was in my life . Prisoner . He pulled me into an alley , and wanted to be concerned with me . Humphreys . I did not pull her into any alley . William Dunn . I was constable of the night , about one o'clock in the morning the Prosecutor brought the Prisoner into St. Martin 's watch-house , and told me as he has said now , that she had robbed him by the assistance of two men of a guinea ; that he had never let her go from him , and was sure she must have it about her . I searched her , took 2 s. and some half pence out of her pocket ; I said to Ind search her behind and before ( I ask pardon , my Lord ) he has got a pretty good hand at searching ; he searched her , and took the guinea out of her mouth ; I was the more ready to have her searched , because the man was very positive and very sober . I took her aside , and desired her to give an account of her two accomplices , by which the might probably save her own life ; instead of giving any direct answer to that , I think , to the best of my knowledge , she said , whether I had any assistance or not , I will make no confession : then she pulled me back , whispered me in the ear , ( I thought she had changed her mind , and would have discovered her accomplices ) and said , Mr. Constable , I know it is in your power to leave the watch-house door open , and let me go out , if you will , you shall have a - whenever you please . Thomas Ind . I belong to the house of correction at Tothill Fields Bridewell . On the 22d of December about nine o'clock at night I went to the goal with some prisoners , and said till near twelve . I was going home into Covent Garden , and just by the Bagnio at Charing Cross I heard an outcry , I thought there had been some quarrel ; I saw Humphreys with the Prisoner in his right hand ; he told me he was robbed by the Prisoner and two men , and desired me to go with him to the watch-house ; when I came there , Mr. Dunn thought I was a proper person , and desired me to search her . I pulled off her stockings , searched all her clothes , and found 2 s. 4 d. and a bag of tobacco ; then I searched her arm pits , and every where that I could , but could not find the guinea ; then I said , D - n you open your mouth ; she opened it , and turned out her tongue double ; I put my finger into her mouth , and brought the guinea out : she said something afterwards in a vulgar manner , but I could not tell what it was . Prisoner . He is a runner at goals , and gets his living that way ; he said he would hang me . Ind . I never said any such thing , nor was I ever concerned in any goal till a little before Michaelmas . Paul Broadbent ( the Beadle ) I held the candle while Ind searched her , and at last he brought the guinea out of her mouth . I said she had better confess who were her accomplices ; she said , if she was hanged herself , she would not bring in any other person to be hanged . Benj Meadows . I was going home between tweleve and one , and when I was against the Mewsgate , I heard watch cried out ; I did not mind it at first , and walked softly on ; when I came against my own door , I saw Humphreys have hold of the Prisoner by the hand ; when I came up he was surrounded by several people ; some said let her go , others said do not let her go ; I heard Humphreys speak , and knew his voice : said I , Humphreys , is it you ? he said , yes ; and told me he was robbed of a guinea : said I , if you are robbed , do not let her go . We carried her to the watch-house , Mr. Ind searched her all over , and could not find it , but at last he pulled the guinea out of her mouth - I have known the Prisoner some years . Jury to Dunn . Do you believe the Prosecutor was down upon his back , for it was very dirty weather then , and his clothes must be dirty ? Dunn . I did not enquire into that , but I believe by the terror and fright he seemed to be in that the thing was true , and that made me get the best hand in the watch-house to search her . Guilty , Death . 132 . + John * Smith , of St. Paul 's Covent Garden , was indicted for stealing five silver spoons , value 40 s. and ten yards of linen cloth , value 10 s. the goods of Charles Ogle , in his shop , December 8 . * He goes among the fraternity by the name of James the Minister .

Mrs. Ogle brought me a search warrant ; there was a poor woman took Mrs. Ogle and myself to a house in Church Lane , shewed us the Prisoner , and said , that was the man that robbed her , and the Prisoner being strictly charged with it , he said , if you will forgive me , I will tell you the truth . Mrs. Ogle said , if he would discover his accomplices , it would be the better for him , for she believed somebody must have been concerned with him , because the shutters were a great weight . He denied it at first , but afterwards owned that one John Heatley was concerned with him in pawning them ; that the two tea-spoons were sold , one by Singing Moll , and the other by Grace Palmer . This spoon was sold to one Michael Compigney for 2s . 3 d. and the other to one Barber for 15 d.

She kept the keys of the room , and the bureau , and I kept the key of the chest where these things were . Jury . Did she deliver them back to you again every time she wore them ? Margerum . Yes , very frequently , because I always kept the key of the chest , and it was very proper I should . Jury . Was the chest broke open ? Margerum . The staple was drawn . I did not design to mention it if I could have helped it . Prisoner . Did not she wear the rings and watch and snuff-box that Sunday on which you charge the robbery to be committed ? Margerum . The thing was done in the morning . It might be so , I ca n't tell , for I was out all the day . Prisoner . Does not the house go in the name of Fifield , for fear of your being indicted for keeping a bawdy house ? Margerum . The house does go in the name of Fifield , because I have two houses . Prisoner . Have not you a house behind St. Clement 's , that goes by the name of Margerum ? Margerum . I have a House there . * The sign of the Castle in Wychstreet . Prisoner . How many houses have you to let to lewd women of the town ? Margerum . Never an one . Prisoner . Have you any in White Chapel ? Margerum . No . Prisoner . Did not you let a house to Sam Mecum ? Margerum . No , I did not . Prisoner . This is entirely through jealousy , and I hope the court will consider it . Rebecca Seymour . I was a servant to Mr. Margerum , but had left his service about a fortnight before this happened . I was there on twelfth day about 5 or 6 at night : Mrs Margerum was above , I met the prisoner upon the second stair as he was going up the second pair of stairs ; he asked for Mrs. Margerum and went into the room where she was , and where Mr. Margerum and she lay , and shut the door . In about a quarter of an hour they came down . Mrs. Margerum had a bundle in her hand , and they both went out together . Q . Did she or he carry the bundle out ? Seymour . He helped her out with it . There was a linen gown and several other things in a large apron . The prisoner gave me a shove , and I was afraid he was going to cut me . Q . Why was you afraid he should cut you ? Seymour . Because he often carried hangers with him . He had one in his coat then . Q . What did he shove you for ? Seymour . I suppose to get by me . Prisoner . Had Mrs. Margerum her apron tied round her , or was it loose ? Seymour . I can not be certain whether it was tied on or no . Prisoner . Did not Mrs. Margerum deliver the keys to John Jones a nd Mary Sleep , when she went out ? Seymour . She threw the keys down . Prisoner . Did not Mrs. Margerum say when she went out , tell Mr. Margerum I have got nothing but my own ? Seymour . I did not hear any such thing . Q . Was the prisoner there much that day ? Seymour . He was in and out every minute almost all day . Mr. Margerum was out of town all day . Mrs. Margerum said he was afraid before of being bit ; but she said to the prisoner , ladies do n't mind it . Prisoner . This is one of the ladies . John Jones . On Sunday was sev'night hearing a noise in the room up two pair of stairs , I went up , and Mrs. Margerum and the prisoner were there . He went down stairs and she followed him with a bundle in her apron . She was going to take away some more things ; and the last witness interposed and went to hinder her from going out . The prisoner pushed her away and began to d - n his eyes , and swear in a violent manner . I was afraid to interpose , because he always wore a hanger under his arm . Then the prisoner laid hold of the bundle she had , and carried it cross the Strand . Prisoner . Was her apron tied on ? Jones . I ca n't tell whether it was tied on or no . Q . How did he carry the bundle ? Jones . He put his hand under the bundle and carried it out . Q . Did he take the bundle from her and carry it out ? Jones . He was so eager that he laid hold of the bundle - he did not take it from her , he took hold of it and carried it out of the house . Q . Did the woman quit the bundle or no ? Jones . I ca n't say whether she loosed it or no . Q . Did the prisoner or the woman carry the bundle out of the house ? Jones . They both helped ; he laid hold of it , and said , Come along ; and they both went out together . Q . How did he carry his hanger ? Jones . Under his arm ( I ca n't say which arm ) with a belt over his breast under his coat . As we were carrying him along in the coach , he threatened to push me through with a penknife . I saw this pocket book and hook taken out of his pocket , I know it to be Mr. Margerum 's . I have seen him have it - there was a gold repeating watch , & c. found upon Mrs. Margerum . Q . Did the prisoner say how he came by the pocket book and hook ? Jones . He owned they were Mr. Margerum 's , and that he had them from his wife . Jury . Are you a servant to Margerum ? Jones . I am a porter to an apothecary . I rent a lodging of him . Prisoner . Was not Mrs. Margerum 's apron tied on ? Jones . It was tied about her middle when she came down stair . But when she went out it was untied ; I did not see her untie it , but she put some more things into it . Q . After she came down stairs did she untie the bundle and put things into it ? Jones . Yes . Q . What things did she put into it ? Jones . A gown and some other linen . Q . The gown was in the bundle before , was there any other put in ? Jones . There was another put in below stairs . Q . Did she tie the apron on afterwards ? Jones . No , it was untied when she went out of the house . Prisoner . Did not I stand by the fire side when she came down stairs ? Jones . You was in the house , but you was higher the door than the fire , when you came down stairs , she followed you directly . Prisoner . Did not Mrs. Margerum offer you or the maid the keys , and say , tell Mr. Margerum I have got nothing but my own ? Jones . I do n't remember that . The Prisoner 's defence . Prisoner . I have got Sarah Sleep , Mr. Margerum 's maid , who has lived with him six or seven years , I desire she may be called . Sarah Sleep . I was at Mr. Margerum 's on Twelfth Day , and about six o'clock in the evening as John Jones and I were sitting by the fire , Mrs. Margerum called for a candle , and went up two pair of stairs ; while she was above the Prisoner came in , she ordered me to bring her an apron , and I carried it to her : she took some things off the bed , and tied them up in it , and I tied the apron upon her . The Prisoner was sitting by the coffee room fire all the time , and she gave me the keys to give to my master when he came home . Q . Did she use to wear that gold watch ? Sleep . Yes ; she always wore it by her side to know what time the girls went out or in - The girls who were pliers to the house , a couple of young girls that they had . Q . What did they keep those girls for ? Sleep . To bring gentlemen out and in . Q . What use was the watch of to her ? Sleep . To see what time they went out , for fear they should go to another tavern , and not come to her house . Q . Who went out of the house first , the Prisoner or Mrs. Margerum . Sleep . She went out first , and the Prisoner followed her - about a minute after ; I was in the entry then . Q . Did not they go out together ? Sleep . No ; I am sure they did not , she carried out the bundle in her apron . Q . Did the Prisoner assist her in carrying it out ? Sleep . He was not by her , and I am sure he did not assist her . Prisoner . Ask her whether she did not see Mrs. Margerum give me the pocket book in the passage . Sleep . She gave it out of her hand into his in the passage . Q . Was not the Prisoner in Margerum 's bed-chamber ? Sleep . No , not at all ; he was all the time by the coffee room fire . Q . Where or when was the pocket book delivered to him ? do you know how the Prisoner came by that pocket book : [ the pocket book was produced to her , and she stood at a pause a considerable time . ] Sleep . I do not know any thing of it . Q . Do you live there now ? Sleep . I left the service because the girls and I could not agree . I live in my own lodging ; [ she was asked where that was , but made no answer . ] Margerum . The Prisoner has taken up one of my witnesses , and threatened to transport Sleep , if she gave her Evidence for me . Ann Moore . I live at the three Tuns in Aylosse Street Goodman 's Fields , the Prisoner lodged with me two years and two months - I sell wine - The Prisoner is a breeches maker , he mends breeches . Q . Does he follow the business now ? Moore . He works at the business . Q . Did he follow his business so as to get his bread by it ? Consider you are upon your oath . Moore . I know the contents of an oath , I am not a girl : he has followed it till within this fortnight , till Mrs. Margerum drew him away ( this Sarah Sleep was her intimate servant , and always at her elbow . ) Mrs. Margerum told me one day she was going to see a play ; what play , says I ? a play that is nothing but love . Now I will tell you what Mr. Margerum said : on Monday morning I was in bed , he came and knocked me out of bed : ( the Prisoner and I had some words because he did not come home : ) says he , I am going to my wife and the Prisoner ; says I , what do you design to do with them , hang them both ? Said he , I have had Sims before a Justice , and he has got irons on ; and said I , what have you done with your wife ; well , said he , I begged her off : this is true , and what I will say before God and all the Judges . Q . What was the Prisoner 's behaviour while he lived with you ? Moore . He behaved modest and well , and never did any thing amiss . Q . Have you any other way of living ? Moore . No ; but I have a husband who has a gift of two voices , a gift which God Almighty has given him ; and he goes to gentlemens houses and other places to divert gentlemen and ladies . Hannah Terry . I am servant to that Lady [ Mrs. Moore ] I have known the Prisoner two years and two Months , I never knew him behave any otherwise than civilly . He is a breeches maker ; he worked for my master 's brother - two years and two months - he worked all the while with him . Q . What dress did he go in , did he use to wear a laced hat ? Terry . Not till within these two months . Q . How came he to wear a laced hat ? Terry . He is a soldier . Moore . I forgot that ; he is a soldier , my Lord , and it behoves a soldier to wear a hanger - he has been a soldier about six weeks ; his Sergeant 's name is Temples ; he belongs to Colonel Stuart 's regiment . Q . Does not your Mistress bring men home along with her ? [ The witness was silent . ] Q . Does not your Mistress walk about o'nights ? Terry . Only about her houshold business , to fetch in errands . Q . Does she keep any women in her house ? Moore . I do not keep any women in my house ; I do not love women , I can hardly bear a maid servant to wait upon me . Q . Do not you go to visit Mrs. Margerum ? Moore . She came once to my house , and called for half a pint of wine , but by what I can find since , she came to court the Prisoner . Q. to Terry . Do n't you know that your Mistress walks abroad o'nights ? Terry . Not by the way of men . Charles Flortiau . Mrs. Moore lived about seven or eight years ago in York buildings , and lodged in a common Bawdy-house . She went by the name of Chamberlain . John Ball . I have known Mrs. Moore 's house to be a base house for some years , and she a base woman : 't is a reputed Bawdy-house ; I have seen her abundance of time , go out to pick up men on Tower hill , waiting to pick up gentlemen . I have seen her abroad with other men , besides the man that goes for her husband . Moore . I suppose you are an enemy to Harry , [ the Prisoner ] Mr. Rondeau . I knew Mrs. Moore twenty years ago , she used to go by the name of Chamberlain . She walked in Spring Gardens at Vaux Hall , and picked up men there . Moore . Pray did you pick me up , or did I pick you up ? Rondeau . She asked almost every one to give her a glass of wine . Moore . You know VauxHall is a very pleasant place ; I know you very well , for I remember you picked me up there once . Rondeau . Every man that goes by her door now , she asks them , whether they will walk in . I have business that way sometimes , she has asked me many a time . Moore . It is a sign I have obliged you , or you would never have given me this character . Acquitted .

The goods and chattels of Elizabeth Taylor widow , feloniously did steal take and carry away , against his Majesty 's peace , & c. Elizabeth Taylor . I live at Bath , and have a residence at Bristol ; I have a shop in the long room near the Hot-wells ; and continue there during the season of the Hot-wells , which is , from the 15th of June , to the 7th of Sept. On Saturday the 21st of July last , my shop was shut up after 11 o'clock at night ; I staid and saw my journeyman and apprentice shut it up . All the goods in the indictment were locked up in the shop that night , there are two pretty large solding doors , which fasten with a staple and a padlock . The gold chased watch was produced and proved by Mrs. Taylor to be her property , and locked up in her shop , the 21st of July at night . John Lewis Demareen . I sold this watch to Mrs. Taylor about six months ago , but there has been a new dial plate put to it since . Then the rings and seals were produced , but there was only one of the five gold rings set with diamonds , and one of the four gold rings set with a saphire and diamonds found . These with about eighteen other rings and some of the seals Mrs. Taylor proved to be her property , and locked up in her shop that night . Q . Was your shop broke open at any time ? Taylor . My shop was shut up the 21st of July at night , and the next morning being Sunday , about seven o'clock my apprentice came to me while I was in bed , and said he must speak to me ; he told me my shop was broke open ; I was very much surprized , but after I had composed myself a little , I went there , and found that the staple was wrenched out , and the padlock unlocked , and then I missed these goods . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Taylor . I know him very well ; I have seen him at Bristol a great many times , and I can say , that on the Friday morning before my shop was broke open , the Prisoner came up to my glasses , and locked at them - I think , ( but I can not be positive ) I saw him in the Long Room that Saturday - I saw him again the Wednesday after in the Long Room ; that was the last time . Q . When did you advertise these goods ? Taylor . I sent to some of my dealers to advertise them , and I received a letter from Sir Thomas De Veil , I think it was dated December 14 , wherein he acquainted me , that he had committed to New Prison one Elias Castaing , and had found upon him a gold chased watch and several rings . James Berrisford . I am apprentice to Mrs. Taylor , these rings and the watch in particular were in her shop the 21st of July at night ; I locked it up myself , our maid called me the next morning between six and seven , and told me the shop was broke open . I went and found one of the doors about a quarter open , and some rings and other goods loose upon the counter , and upon making an examination , I missed these things - to the best of my remembrance , the night that this happened when I was shutting up the shop I saw the prisoner at the roley poley table . Mr. Mercy . I live at Bristol , the Prisoner lodged with me about six months . I live about a musquet shot , or about three times the length of this room from the Hot-wells . - I do not remember the day of the month Mrs. Taylor 's shop was broke open ; I know it was on a Saturday . Q . Was the Prisoner indebted to you ? Mercy . He always was , and always very scantys of money - The Prisoner staid till the Thursday morning following , and then he said he was going to London , he came back again the Tuesday following at night : he would have paid me the 15 l. he owed me as soon as he came home , but he was in such a trembling that he did not pay me that night , but he paid me the next day . - Mr. Percival paid him 12 l. the Wednesday or Thursday before he went from Bristol , of which he paid me 8l . when he had paid me the 15 l. he took away his clothes , and took a lodging one night or two at a little alehouse , and then left Bristol - He might easily get out of my house at any time without any body 's knowing it . Prisoner 's Council to Mrs. Taylor . Did not the Prisoner say that he was sorry you was robbed ? Mrs. Taylor . I believe somebody was shewing him that my shop was broke open , and I believe he said in broken English , he was sorry for my loss . Mr. Rawlins . The 28th of July the Prisoner , ( who went by the name of Lambert ) and Mr. Clement a shoemaker , came to me with a gold watch and two rings ( it was a gold dial plate then , but it is an enamelled one now ) and pledged them to me for seventeen guineas , and they remained with me two months , and then were redeemed . I think they were brought the 28th of July : he appeared very genteel . Paul Bouillard . The Prisoner was recommended to me by Mr. Vanciliers , a merchant in the city . The first time I bought any thing of the Prisoner was about five months ago , I believe it was about a month before Michaelmas , they were some small roses unset : he came to me very genteel ; he was in the same dress he is now , and I had no mistrust of him . I took this watch out of pawn about three weeks after I bought them ; it was in pawn for seventeen guineas , and he desired I would make the most of it , because he was short of money . Q . How much money has he had of you in all ? Bouillard . As near as I can call to mind about 45 l. I paid him 5 l. 10 s. for the unset roses ; for four rings and a seal 4 l. 4 s. another time 13 l. and a fourth time 22 l. 5 s. 6 d. Q . How much were they worth ? Bouillard . As much as one can make of them - I think I gave the full price for them . Q . Did you set down the times when you bought them , and the money you paid ? Bouillard . As I paid ready money for them , I did not set them down . Q . Did he say how he came by these things ? Bouillard . He said he had bought goods at Bath and at Bristol , and that he had sent goods abroad several times - he said he bought these at Bristol of a man who had a box before him . John Lewis Demareen . When the Prisoner was first taken up , Mr. Bouillard , the Constable , and I , went to his lodgings , I told him I heard he had got some goods that were given out to be stole ; I said he must give an account how he came by the goods he sold to Mr. Bouillard . I acquainted him with the robbery committed at Bristol ; he said he bought them at Bristol about eight or ten days after the robbery was committed . I told him it was very imprudent to buy such things so soon after a robbery : then he said his memory was very bad , it might be three weeks or a month after . I told him I must know the truth , and how he came by them ; and as I was a soreigner , and did not understand the laws of this country , I was willing to go to a person who understood the laws , and went before Sir Thomas De Veil . In the conversation I had with him , he said he bought these things of a shopkeeper in Bristol : I said , I am very glad of it , for then you will easily clear yourself of this affair . Said I , do you know where the man lives ? then he was a little confounded , and said , he bought them of a Jew , who carried a shop before him . I asked him , whether the Jew spoke French ; he said , he did not , but he made him understand that he would give him so many guineas , and that he laid out his money to get something by them . I asked him in what place he bought them ; he said , he bought them at his own lodging , and since that he has told me he bought them in the street . When he came before Sir Thomas , he said he bought them of a man at Bristol , who had a little shop before him . When the watch was produced , I knew it perfectly well , because I had sold it to Mrs Taylor : he said he bought the watch three weeks after the robbery was committed . Mr. Bouillard said he believed Mr. Demareen had given a faithful account of what passed relating to this affair . The Prisoner made his defence in the French tongue , which was interpreted to the Court and the Jury : That he went out of the Long Room that night at half an hour after ten , in company with Mr. Mercy and some other persons who he does not know , went home with Mr. Mercy to his own lodging , supped with him , Miss Bartlet , and another , and went to bed about eleven o'clock as he used to do ; the next morning about seven o'clock Mr. Mercy knocked at his door for breakfast , and directly after that he went to drink the Waters at the Hot-wells , then went to hear a sermon in the town , and dined with Mr. Percivall : he does not know how they can accuse him when he knows he was in his own room . That on the 25th or 26th of that month , he received some money of Mr. Percivall , and that with what he received before was about 41 l. And as he was coming home - the Wednesday night after the robbery , he met a man , who pulled him by the arm , as if he wanted to speak with him , and shewed him his merchandize in his box which he had before him ; that the man took him into a passage , he looked at them , and bid him as much as he thought they were worth ; laid out about eighteen guineas , and gave him something to drink : that there was a dispute between him and Mr. Mercy , who had asked him for money , and used him ill , so he took a resolution to go to London . That he was several days in Bristol after the robbery was committed , and if he had been guilty , he would not have staid there so long . When he came to London , he went to Mr. Clement 's the shoemaker to get him to help him to some money on these things ; he did not care to let people know he wanted money so much as to pawn these things , and that was the reason he did not put them in his own name , for he thought to take them out again very soon . When he had raised some money , he went down to Bristol again to satisfy Mr. Mercy ; and that he shewed these things publickly to Mr. Cumberford and several other people , which he would not have done if he had stole them . Mr. Cumberford . The Prisoner lodged in my house about six or seven weeks , ten or eleven months ago ; and about eight days after he came to my house , he had a bill of 63 l. some shillings sent him , I got it accepted , and it was paid by a 50 l. bank note , and the rest in cash . About four months ago he shewed me three or four small rings - I am a jeweller . Q . What was the occasion of his shewing you those rings , was it to borrow money on them , or to sell them ? Cumberford . He shewed them me to ask the value of them - as to his character , I never heard any thing amiss of him . He always kept very good company , and paid me very well . Mr. Peccarereau . I have known Mr. Castaing about six or seven years . During the time I have known him , I always took him to be a very honest man . I knew him at Bourdeaux , he always was reputed to be an honest man . He would not keep company with those who were not so . I have had dealings with him , and he has paid me very honestly . He has some friends who are very rich . I know they have supplied him , and will supply him again - the prisoner shewed me some rings at Mr. Cumberford 's . Issac Cuttercau , ( a merchant at Bourdeaux ) I know his uncle has remitted him several sums of money . Whether he has done it within these six or eight months I do n't know - he shewed me some rings at Mr. Cumberford 's about 5 months ago . Sir Charles Le Blond . I knew Mr. Castaing at Tunbridge Wells last summer was twelve months . I had very little acquaintance with him ; he was acquainted with the nobility and gentry . He once desired to borrow 20 guineas of me , which I lent him , and in two day 's time he wrote me a complaisant letter and returned the money again . Mr. Griffan . I have known the prisoner about fifteen years , almost from a child , he was always reckoned an honest man , and every one was pleased with his behaviour . His uncle sent to me to endeavour to get some place for him . Mr. Luneau . I went to pay a visit to the attorney general of Jersey . Mr. Castaing was there ; and at the attorney 's recommendation , I took him into my house and he behaved very well . Mr. De Maltus . About three months ago he breakfasted with me , and he has done so almost every morning these 9 or 10 weeks , and always behaved well . I left my purse once with 30 or 40 guineas in it upon a table in the room where he was , and I did not lose any thing out of it . He has been three or four hours together in my apartment . I found he was very much of a gentleman . Mr. Lynch . The first acquaintance I had with him was at Bath last winter was 12 months . I was frequently in his company , and he always behaved well . Q . What opinion have you of his honestly ? Lynch . A very good one ; because I have heard of his family , and they are people of very great reputation at Bourdeaux . I very little expected such an action from him . Mr. Blake . I saw Mr. Castaing last season at Tunbridge Wells , and in very good company . He always behaved like a gentleman . Mr. Lockman . I have known Mr. Castaing about three months . I came acquainted with him at Slaughter 's Coffee house , he behaved much like a gentleman ; he was respected by every body there . And if he had not been reckoned a gentleman they would not have kept him company . I should not have thought he would have been guilty of such a thing as this . James Julian . I have known him about twenty months , and have lent him four or five pieces at a time and he always paid me very honestly . If he had had a mind to have wronged me , he might have done it . Mr. Chapman . I have known him about two months . His appearance and behaviour during that time have been so much like a gentleman , that I could not have thought he would have been guilty of any such thing . Mr. Griffan Jun . I have known him between 3 and 4 years , he is a very honest gentleman . Pros . Coun . Did you ever know him deal in jewels ? Griffan . No , Sir . Mr. Shaw . I have had no knowledge of him till about sixteen months ago . I saw him several times at Bath ; and there was no such suspicion of him there . Q. to Mercy . Pray can you recollect where you was that night ? Mercy . I was at the Long Room - I came home between 10 and 11 o'clock . Q . Was the prisoner at home before you ? Mercy . Yes , he was at home before me . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 142. Richard Manning , was indicted for a misdemeanour , in unlawfully , and wickedly laying hands on John Davis , with an intent to commit the detestable sin of sodomy ; And , 143. John Davis , for unlawfully , and wickedly permitting , and suffering the said Richard Manning to lay hands on him , with an intent to commit the said sin of sodomy , December 31 . Sarah Holland . My husband keeps the Mermaid Inn in Great Carter Lane . On the 31st of December , between 9 and 10 at night the prisoners came in together and asked for a pot of beer . I did not know but they might be country gentlemen , so I run into the room and asked them if they would have a fire , they said no , they should not stay . I went into the next room where my husband was in bed . There is a wainscot partition between the 2 rooms , about 5 feet high , and the rest is glass , and a curtain to part of it . I looked through the glass , and saw them sitting facing one another with their knees jammed in together . I said to my husband , I believed they were sodomites . Then I looked through a thin curtain and saw them kissing one another . A little after I looked in again , and saw Manning 's hand in Davis 's breeches . I looked in again , and then Davis had his hand in Manning 's breeches . After that Manning put his tongue into Davis 's mouth : they seeing a candle in my room , got up and came to the window to look if they could see the shade of any body ; then they set down again , and Davis shewed what he had to Manning ; they kissed one another for some time , and then Davis opened his breeches : I had not patience any longer , and called Robert Wright , and said , I have heard talk of sodomites , and I believe these are some ; Wright said he had not patience ; I looked again , and saw them acting as man and woman : - I saw them act as such . Then I lifted up my sash , thinking they would go away . What do you mean , said I , by 2 men acting as man and woman . Q . Was Manning 's back or his face to Davis ? Holland . I believe his face . Q . When you saw the first fact , why did not you discover it ? Holland . I do n't know . When they found I had discovered them , Davis run into the yard with his breeches down , thinking he was going into the street , and some gentlemen stopped them both . Manning . Did you see my breeches down , or any such thing ; or did I run into the yard ? Holland . No . Manning . The prisoner Davis pulled what he had out of his breeches , and asked me whether I ver clapped , and I said , no , nor poxed neither ; he said he was clapped , and desired I would look at - Q . Did you hear any such conversation ? Holland . I did not hear them talk any thing . Davis . I was very much in liquor . I do n't know how I came to go to that house . Holland . They were both very sober . Edward Morey . I happened to be at Mr. Holland 's and saw the prisoners in a back parlour that looks into the yard . Mrs. Holland called me into the little room , which she lies in , where Mr. Holland was then in bed , and desired me to stay . There is a partition wainscot 4 or 5 foot high , the rest is glass . She took hold of the corner of one of the curtains and desired me to look . According to her desire I did look , and saw the prisoners knees close to one another , and their faces as close together as ever mine and my wife 's were - they were sitting face to face . Mr. Manning got out of his chair and looked to the glass to see if any body was looking . I went into the back yard with a design to look through the window , and presently Mrs. Holland cried out , nasty rogues , vile fellows . I met Davis at the entry door going into the yard with the lower part of his breeches unbuttoned , and his shirt out . He said , for God 's sake let me go , or I am ruined to all intents and purposes . He said , it was the first crime that ever he committed of that kind before - Manning denied it to all intents and purposes , was in a great rage , and asked me whether I would accuse him of being guilty of any such thing - they were sober to my thoughts . Robert Wright . I lodge at Mr. Holland 's . On the 31st of December , a little after 9 , I was going to bed ; Mrs. Holland met me at the foot of the stairs , and said , Wright , come here . I went into the little room , the candle was out . Said she , I have heard talk of sodomites , I believe there are some here . Says I , I do n't like the thoughts of them . I looked through the glass and saw them close together : says she , look now , they are bussing . At last Davis got up , he had got his shirt hanging out of his breeches : he went between Manning 's legs , and here he went - Mrs. Holland had not patience any longer , but threw up the sash , and said , you d - d dogs , what are you doing of ? Q . Were they face to face when you saw this ? Wright . Yes ; Davis was between Manning 's knees ; and when Mrs. Holland said , what are you doing of , they quitted one another . Q . What position was Manning in ? Wright . He was sitting in his chair - Davis got up and went to Manning 's chair , and got between his legs . Q . Did you see Manning do any act ? Wright . He put his hand to the entrance of Davis 's breeches . Q . Do you think it was to assist him in this sodomitical act , or to prevent him . Wright . I believe to assist him . Q . You say Davis 's face was towards Manning ? Wright . They came face to face : I advised Davis to put his breeches up , but he could not in two or three times trying , he was so much frightened : he said Manning had been the ruin of him - Davis said Manning had drawn him away several times , and Manning said that Davis pulled his - out to him . Jonathan Green . The last day of the old year I saw the Prisoners at Mr. Holland 's , which was the first time I ever saw them in my life ; on a sudden there was a great noise ; presently came in Mrs. Holland ; says she , Mr. Green , here are a couple of sodomites ; I said , God forbid ; I got from my chair , came into the passage , and there was Davis with his shirt out of his breeches : he sled into the backside to get off , for the fore door was fastened , but the hostler brought him in again : his shirt was out still ; then he came and begged of me to intercede with the landlady to let him go : said I , Friend , if you had brought a girl into the house , I would have interceded for you both to go ; but as it is , let the law take its place , for I will have nothing to do with you . He entreated to be let go , and said , he was undone ; I said , it was a pity the thing had fell out so , that it was a wicked thing , and I would not screen him in it - As to Manning , he looked like an old rat in an iron cage , he did not make any attempt to go away . Q . Why did you take him to be like an old rat ? Green . Because he looked very cunning . Manning . I was buying a penny seed cake at a pastry cook 's in Cheapside , and Davis was buying a wig ; we were going to part ; said he , shall we drink once ; I said , I do not care if I do , so we went to the Mermaid ; then he asked me concerning a clap , and pulled out his - to shew me , and I put my hand out to examine him . Q . Are you a Doctor ? Manning . Yes ; I practise that way . Davis . I bought a half penny bunn in Cheapside , and was going to the Goose and Gridiron , and when I met Manning , he asked me to go with him to this house . Q . Did you ever see him before ? Davis . Very seldom . Manning . I never saw him but once , and that was one morning to drink half a pint of purl . Joseph White . I keep the Leghorn warehouse in Leadenhall Street , Davis was my servant to clean knives and run of errands : he lived with me sixteen months , and behaved very well . I never saw him drunk but once , and then he was mad . John Fort . I am partner with Mr. White , I can only confirm the evidence given by him of the Prisoner living with us , that he behaved well : he was the best servant we ever had in that station - as an errand boy . I never heard he was guilty of any debauchery . William Franklin . I have lain with Davis upwards of sixteen months , and never saw any unhandsom action by him . Guilty . [ Pillory .

I believe he did about two years ago . Prisoner . There is one Stephen Moore , a man who has two voices , was diverting some gentlemen in the house , and I thought at a proper time to shew them a fancy , for I always carry a live pidgeon , and I took this tankard to make use of upon that occasion .
