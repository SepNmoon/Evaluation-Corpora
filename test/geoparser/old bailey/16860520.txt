WHereas in the Account of the Proceedings of the last Sessions , published the 15th day of April last , it was among other things Incerted , That the Right Honourable the Earl of Stamford was likewise discharged by His Majesties Gracious Pardon . Now these are to certifie the Reader , That the same was a mistake for that his Lordship came to the said Sessions upon no other account than to hear the Tryal of one Jacob Joyner , son of that Joyner that keeps the Bull-head Tavern at Chairing-Cross , and commonly called and known by the Name of Cobb Joyner , which said Joyner was by the Grand Jury of Westminster found Guilty of Robbing his Lordship of a Jewel worth about 7 or 800 l. and the Witnesses bound over to prosecute , which Witnesses attended for that purpose ; but the Court ( taking notice that the Felony being committed before the 20th of March last past , was Pardoned by His Majesties late Gracious and General Pardon ) did thereupon discharge Joyner of that Felony by Vertue of the said Pardon , and dismiss 'd the Witnesses from further Attendance on that Court ; but Joyner is continued in Custody upon an Action of Trover brought for recovering the said Jewel , and another for Scandalum Magnatum , wherein the Damages are laid 10000 l .
