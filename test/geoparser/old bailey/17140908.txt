Another depos 'd , that hearing of the Matter , he went in while the Deceas 'd lay to , and that he gave him some Keys and Money out of his Pocket , but could not speak ; and that a Surgeon being sent for , came and dress 'd him , and laid him on a Bed , where the Surgeon by farther Application , brought him to his Speech , and then he describ 'd the Prisoner , but knew not his Name ; only said 't was he that came over from Ostend with Mr. Reignard ( which it , was prov 'd the Prisoner did ) and that he came behind him , pull 'd back his Head , and cut him twice on the Throat . The Prisoner 's Sword and Gloves were found on the Bed in the Room where the Deceas 'd was murder 'd , and he was taken the next Day . He had nothing to say in his Defence , but that he had bespoke a Wig of the Deceas 'd , who ask 'd him 7 l. for it , and afterwards came to 6 l. and that he bidding him 4 l. for it , he , in a Passion , took up a Razor that lay by him , and said he would cut his Throat first , which he did accordingly , and that he ran away , because it is the Custom in France ( in which Country he said he was born , and from which he fled for killing a Man ) that whoever is in the Place where a Man is kill 'd , shall answer for his Blood : But this being look 'd on as a very weak Defence , he was found guilty of wilful Murther .

Fisher , by giving him a mortal Wound with a Knife on the right Side of his Body , near the Pap , on the 21st of July last , of which he languish 'd till the 8th of August , and then dy 'd . By the Evidence it appear 'd , that the Prisoner coming down Stairs , said to a Person who had heard a Noise , and came to see what was the Matter , that she had kill 'd her Husband , and he going up , found him wounded , and he told him he had given his Wife very great Provocation , and had got a Mischief by it . A Woman who nurs 'd the Deceas 'd in his Illness , swore , that he told her he had misus 'd and beat his Wife to a great Degree ; and that thereupon she catch 'd up a Knife , and was going to cut a Pair of Boots that were in the Room ; which he endeavouring to prevent , in the Scuffle the Knife struck him in the Breast . The Prisoner in her Defence said to the same Purpose , that he had beat her with a Horse-whip as long as the small End would last , and then that she in her Rage did attempt to cut his Boots ; but knew not how he came by his Hurt . There were two Surgeons who open 'd his Body , and depos 'd he did not die of the Wound , for that it had not penetrated the Trunk of the Body , and that he had been an infirm Man for a great while before ; whereupon the Prisoner was acquitted . Robert Cook , of the Parish of St. Giles in the Fields , was indicted for breaking the House of Elizabeth Cook on the 16th of August last , in the Night-time , and taking thence two Brass Kettles , and other Goods : But the Evidence not being sufficient to convict him , he was acquitted .

The Evidence depos 'd , That being at Young Man 's Coffee-House about 9 of the Clock in the Evening , with several of his Acquaintance , a Discourse arose concerning the Lords Address in Ireland in Favour of Sir Constantine Phipps , then Lord Chancellor , and one of the Lords Justices of that Kingdom , Whether the Address was made upon the Examination of Witnesses ? And Mr. Moor then coming into the House , and being ask 'd his Opinion of the Address , said , It was without Examination into the Fact ; and added , That Sir Constantine Phipps was a Rascal and a Villain ; upon which the Prisoner said he was much surpriz 'd to hear any Gentleman so forward to condemn a Person in so high a Station ; and that it was taking the Power out of the Legislature , and fixing it in himself ; to which the Deceas 'd reply 'd , he would tell him as much to his Face when he saw him ; and seem 'd much to be displeased with the Prisoner for what he had said , telling him he was under the Protection of the Coffee-House , and if he had him in another Place he would use him scurrily ; The Prisoner answer 'd he would endeavour to return his Usage ; whereupon the Deceas 'd bid the Prisoner hold his prating , and call 'd him Puppy ; upon which Words there was a Silence in the Coffee-Hose for a while , and then some of the Deceased 's Friends talk 'd of a Supper , and he said he would go to the Kitchen and order it , which he repeated twice , and then went out ; and the Prisoner going out a little after , clashing of Swords was heard , and some of the Company ran out , and found the Deceas 'd wounded ; and he being ask 'd how it came , said , Fair , fair , very fair . Margaret Bateman swore , That she saw the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd pass at one another , but could not tell who drew first ; but that Mr. Moor being carry 'd into the Kitchen , said Mr. G P. had done very fairly by him . The Prisoner in his Defence said , The Deceas 'd had given him ill Language , which was acknowledg 'd by the Witnesses on both Sides ; and that , when he pretended to go to order Supper , the Deceas 'd look 'd him full in the Face , as if he expected he should follow him ; which he did , and found him in the Passage , with his Face towards the Coffee-House Door ; and when he saw the Prisoner , he advanc 'd with his Sword drawn ; whereupon the Prisoner drew , and they had several Passes ; and that he receiv 'd two slight Wounds before the Deceas 'd got his . A Minster depos 'd , That being sent for by the Deceas 'd , after he was wounded , to administer the Sacrament to him , he told him he was sorry he had given the Prisoner such provoking Language ; and that when he went to bespeak Supper he had some thoughts he would follow him ; and that what the Prisoner had done was very fair , and if the Law might be dispens 'd with , he wou 'd not have him Prosecuted ; but if he recover 'd , he shou 'd have as great a Value and Esteem for him as for any Man in the Nation . And the Witness asking the Deceas 'd if he might declare this , he reply 'd , It is my desire you should if there be Occasion . The Prisoner had a great many Gentlemen to his Character , who upon their Oaths declar 'd him to be a modest , courteous , inoffensive Man , and had so behav 'd himself in several Stations , Civil and Military ; and it appearing to the Court that the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd were Strangers to each other , the Jury found him Guilty of Manslaughter .
