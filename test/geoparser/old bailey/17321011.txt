Richard Norton , of the Parish of St. Dunstans in the East , was indicted for feloniously stealing a Stick of Logwood , Value 5 s. the Goods of Persons unknown , on the 23d September last . Thomas Cox . I was employ 'd to watch some Logwood on Porters-Key . On the 23d of September , between 7 and 8 at Night , I took the Prisoner with this Stick of Logwood in his Hand . I call 'd for Help , and some of the Porters belonging to the Keys came to my Assistance . A Constable was call 'd , and the Prisoner was carried to the Roundhouse . Prisoner . Was I carrying the Logwood off , or only standing by the Pile ? Cox . He was standing by the Pile , and his Knot was lying on his Foot . I had miss 'd Logwood twice before , and therefore I had rectified the Pile , and taken Notice how the Sticks Lay , so that I can be sure that the Stick the Prisoner had in his Hand was taken off the top of the Pile . I had been with a Load from Stocks-Market to Tower-Wharf , and coming back over the Keys , I stopt at the Pile of Logwood to make Water . One of the Sticks fell against me , upon which I took it up to put it in its Place again , and while I had it in my Hand , Cox came and charged me with stealing it . The Jury acquitted him . 2. Rachel Watson of Cornhill , was indicted for stealing 2 pair of Worsted Stockings , Value 4 s. the Goods of George Bond , Sept. 20 . George Bond . Between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon the prisoner came to my Shop , and ask 'd for a pair of blue grey Stockings , I shew 'd her a Paper in which there were just a dozen pair . She then wanted a different Colour . I turned about and took down another Paper . We did not agree about the Price . She went out , but came in again before I had put up the Stockings , and desir 'd to see another pair . I observed her to double up one pair that lay on the Counter . I turn 'd about again to reach another Parcel . She look 'd over several , but not liking the Price she went away a second time . I miss 'd 2 pair ; I went after her , brought her back , found one pair in her Bosom , and another pair in the Lining of her Gown . She own 'd that one of the Pairs was mine , but said that she bought the other pair at another Hosiers . Prisoner . I cheapen 'd 2 pair of Stockings , the Prosecutor ask 'd me 5 s. 6 d. I bid him 5 s. and took out the Money and laid it on the Counter , but am not sure whether he took it up or no . The Jury found her guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 3. William Sherrington , of St. Botolph without Bishopsgate , was indicted for privately stealing a Wig , Value 4 l. the Goods of Samuel Holland , in the Shop of George Bond , September 11 . Ephraim Ellock . The Prisoner came into Mr. Major ( a Barber ) 's Shop in Bishopsgate-street , between 3 and 4 a Clock ; he complain 'd of the Strangury , and went backwards into the Yard . I suppose at that time he put the Wig into his Breeches . He soon came back and stood talking in the Shop about a Quarter of an Hour , and then went away . I mist the Wig in a few Minutes after it was gone , and went directly to Middle-Row in Holbour , and at the 3d Wig-shop I came to I found it . Mr. Horn who keeps that Shop had it in his Hand when I came in , and he said it was not 5 Minutes since he bought it . - Horn . I bought the Wig of the Prisoner on the 11th of September , towards the Evening ; he said , he had it to sell for a Gentleman 's Servant . He ask 'd a Guinea and a half , I bid him 25 s. and a Shilling for himself ; he said he would have half a Pint of Winethen , and so we agreed . I did not mistrust him , because I had known him a pretty while . He gets his Bread by making up Wigs , and I have bought a great many of him , and took him to be a very honest Man . So that when Mr. Major 's Man came in and said the Wig was stolen , you must needs think I was very much surpriz 'd , and wonder 'd how the Devil came to put it into the Prisoner 's Head . Prisoner . I found the Wig . The Jury found him guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 4. Jonathan Neal , of Bishopsgate , was indicted for stealing a Wire-Grate , Value 4 s. the Goods of Philip Strutton , September 17 . P. Strutton . I lost my Stall-Grate about 5 Weeks ago , and found it exposed to Sale at Mr. Edmund Newsham 's . E. Newsham . About a Month ago , betwixt 6 and 7 at Night , I bought the Grate of the Prisoner for 2 s. he told me 't was his own , and I did not doubt it , for he was my Neighbour , and had the Character of an honest Man . Prisoner . Coming late from Work I found this Grate near the Dust-hole , going into Postern-Row on Tower-hill . John Ayres . The Prisoner is a Ticket-Porter , he has work 'd for me at the Waterside near 5 Years ; he has been intrusted in landing and housing Merchants Goods both by Day and Night , and I never heard any Complaints of him . John Lane . I have known him 12 or 14 Years , I was bound for his Honesty ; I do n't believe he would be guilty of so mean an Action . Other Witnesses gave him a very good Character , and the Jury acquitted him . 5. Martha Wright , of Queenhith , was indicted for stealing a suit of Cambrick Head-cloaths lac 'd , Value 3 l. the Goods of Mary Hobbs , in the House of Charles Blandy , Sept. 16 . Mary Hobbs . The Prisoner was my Fellow-Servant at Mr. Blandy 's , a Tobacconist , on Breadstreet-hill ; I had leave to go out on Friday Afternoon , and when I return 'd in the Evening my Mistress was gone to Epsom . Next Morning I miss 'd my Headcloaths out of my Box ; I suspected the Prisoner , and I took her before Alderman Brocas ; she deny 'd it at first , but as she was going to the Compter , she pull 'd the Headcloaths out of her Pocket , and put them into my Hand . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 6. Elizabeth Page , of St. Margaret Westminster , was indicted for privately stealing 18 Yards of Check , Value 30 s. in the Shop of Joanna Lewis , September 6 . Joanna Lewis . I keep a Shop in the Great Ambry [ Almonry ] Westminster ; I desir 'd a Woman to watch my Door while I went Upstairs , I had not been gone up long , when it seems the Prisoner came to this Woman , and ask 'd her if she had any Check ; upon which the Woman call 'd me down , but before I came the Prisoner was gone , and had taken this Piece of Check with her . She was pursued , and brought back in less than a Quarter of an Hour , with the Goods upon her . Jane Gregoire . As I was standing at my own Shop Door , I saw the Prisoner go up to a Woman at the Prosecutor 's Door , and ask her if she had any Checks ? The Woman said she did not know , but would call the Mistress of the Shop , and so she went in , and the Prisoner after her , and in a Moment the Prisoner came out again , and run away with the Check I sent 2 Boys after her , and follow 'd my self , and kept my Eye on her till she was taken . The Jury found her guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7. John Bowen , of St. Mary le Strand , was indicted for stealing 2 Pewter Quart-Pots , Value 3 s. the Goods of James Beard , September 25 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 8. Elizabeth Rayner , of St. Sepulchres , was indicted for privately stealing a Watch studded with Silver , Value 30 s. from the Person of Robert Alexander , Sept. 27 . I lost my Watch between 9 and 10 at Night at a Cook's-shop in Chare and it was found upon the Prisoner in less than a Quarter of an Hour afterwards . Court . Was the Prisoner in your Company ? Alexander . I think it was the that brought me Victuals and Drink . Court . Did you sit in a publick Room ? Alexander . I think so . It was such a Place as People sit in to eat their Victuals . Court . Was no Body else near you ? Alexander . None but she and her Landlady . Court . Did not you and the Prisoner go into that House together ? Alexander . No ; I was there before she came in . Court . How long ? Alexander . Two or three Minutes . I stay 'd there above an Hour , and then she went away , and as soon as she was gone I miss 'd my Watch . It was a Silver Watch in a sort of a Fish-skin Case , studded with Silver . Mary Peirce . The Prisoner was carried to the Watch-house , and I being at the Watch-house Door was called in , and she gave me this Watch , and told me that the Prosecutor had left it with her in pledge for a Crown . Daniel Peirce . As I was sitting with my Barrow of Oysters in Smithfield , the Prisoner came to me , and said , my Wife wanted me , and I must go . I told her , no Body should make me go to my Wife . Why , say she , I 'll tell you what it 's about ; I have nail 'd a Watch , and I shall make my self for ever , if I can find any Body that I can trust to dispose of it for me . Court . What did you think she meant by nailing ? Peirce . I do n't understand those Newgate Words . Court . Keeper ! Can you inform the Court ? Keeper . Not I , my Lord , but I believe some of our People can . I 'll ask . Here 's one says it signifies stealing . * * Nailing , is likewise used metaphorically to signify , securing , taking-hold-of , or apprehending . e.g . Tom Beck says of John Davison , He told me himself that Peter Buck was nail 'd out of his Company . Vide , Sessions Paper , Numb . 4. pag . 104 . Peirce . I told her I would have nothing to do with it , and so she went away , and presently after , her Landlady came and told me , that Betty ( the Prisoner ) had wrong 'd a Man of a Watch . Elizabeth Burker , the Landlady . The Prosecutor came into my House , and the Prisoner follow 'd him in 2 or 3 Minutes ; he said , he wanted something to eat . I told him I had cold Flank Beet , or hot Leg of Beef . He chose Leg of Beef ; he stay 'd about an Hour , or something better , and then she went out . As soon as she was gone , he said he had lost his Watch , and so he went to the Door , and call 'd out Watch ! Watch ! John Masters , Watchman . I was call 'd to take the Prisoner out of a House where she was gone to . The Prosecutor charged me with her , and I carried her down before the Constable , and there I left her safe . Prisoner . As I was going along Smithfield with a ha'perth of Plumb-pudding in my Hand , the Prosecutor came up , and ask 'd me to give him a bit ? With all my Heart , says I , and so I did . Well , says he , since you are so civil , I 'll make you drink ; and so he took me to a Gin-shop , and gave me a Quartern of Brandy ; then , says he , I do n't much like this Liquor , but if you 'll go somewhere else , I 'll treat you with a Mug of Ale . And so I carried him to my Landlady 's ; there she stands . And there he gave me a Shilling to lye with me . I told him , I would not do it for a Shilling . Well , says he , I 'll give you a Crown then ; but as I have not so much about me , I 'll leave you my Watch in Pledge till I bring you the Money , and so he did . Then I went to Mary Peirce , and told her of it , and she proffer 'd to sell it for me , if I would let her have half the Money ; but I told her no , I would keep it longer to see if the Gentleman wou 'd come to redeem it . As for Mary Peirce and her Husband too , they both return 'd from Transportation but last Christmas . Daniel Peirce . 'T is no such thing ; I had sold my self indeed to go over Sea as a Servant , and my Time being out , I came home again . Prosecutor . When I was with the Prisoner in the Watch-house , she swore bitterly that she never saw my Watch . John Astley . Yes ; she swore she knew nothing of it , tho ' she had then given it to Mary Peirce , and Mary Peirce had deliver 'd it to me . Court to the Prosecutor . Did you give the Prisoner a Shilling ? Prosecutor . Yes , I did . Court . For what ? Prosecutor . Upon Condition as she said it was customly to give a Woman a Shilling upon such an Account . Court . And did not she insist upon a Crown ? Prosecutor . No . The Jury found her guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9.

Catherine Dean , alias Dear , of St. Georges 's Hanover-square , was indicted for stealing 3 Hens , Value 3 s. the Goods of Wilfred Oldridge , Sept. 15 . Acquitted . 11. William Davison , of St. Margarets Westminster , was indicted for stealing 17 Books , Value 50 s. the Goods of Duncan Macqueen , in his House , Sept. 26 . Duncan Macqueen . I am an Attorney ; the Prisoner had been my Servant for about 6 Weeks , I mist 17 Books , I suspected the Prisoner , and examin 'd him . He deny 'd that he knew any thing of 'em . I was resolv 'd to search some Booksellers-shops , and the first I went to was Mr. Charles Marsh 's , at the End of the Street where I live ; I enquir 'd for some Law Books , and among others he shew 'd me these five , which are part of those I lost . Here 's Brown on Fines ; Brown 's Practice of th e Exchequer ; Retorna Brevium ; The Compleat Sheriff ; and Nelson 's Lex Maneviorum . I told Mr. Marsh that those Books were stolen from me , and ask 'd him whom he had them from ? He describ 'd the Prisoner , I took him home to my House , and as soon as he saw the Prisoner , he said , that 's the Man . The Prisoner then confess 'd he had taken 'em , but said he was driven to Necessity , and intended as soon as possible to raise Money and fetch them again . Prisoner . I told Mr. Marsh that I sold 'em for your use , and the Money I got for them was laid out in Necessaries for your House ; you know that you sent me to pawn a Silver Seal at the Chandler's-Shop , for no Body would trust you for a Penny ; and you have since moved off your Goods by Night . Macqueen . As for pawning the Seal and moving off by Night , you say true , for I was got into but indifferent Circumstances . Prisoner , And when I was before Justice De Veil , you trod upon my Toes , and whisper 'd me , that if I would say no more , you would be easy . Macqueen . I was tender of you , as you had been a House-keeper , and lived in good repute . Charles Marsh . When Mr. Macqueen brought me to his House , the Prisoner told me , that he had sold other Books to Mr. Millan at Charing-Cross ; we went to Mr. Millan 's , and found one Book which the Prisoner said he had sold to him . From thence we went to the Anchor and Vine at Charing-Cross ; Macqueen then said , that the Prisoner might go about his Business , for he would not prosecute him , and so the Prisoner was discharged . When he was gone , Macqueen threatened to prosecute me for receiving stolen Goods . He sent a Girl on some Message to his Wife , and when the Girl return 'd , he ask 'd her , who let her in , and she describ 'd the Prisoner . I told him I thought it was very strange , that he should still harbour a Man whom he pretended had robb 'd him . He said , if I would get his Books from Mr. Millan 's , I should come to no harm ; I told him I would not trust to that , and so I got a Constable , went to his House , and apprehended the Prisoner . The Jury acquitted him . 12 , 13. John Turner and Thomas Evershet , of St. James 's Westminster , were indicted for stealing 4 Brass Locks , value 4 l. 4 Keys , value 2 s. 16 Brass Screws , value 2 s. and 4 Brass Box Staples , value 2 s. the Goods of Borlace Webb , Esq ; in his House , Sept. 19 . John Young . I keep a Coffee-House in Malborough-Street , in St. James 's . Mr. Webb had a House to be Lett , in Great-Marlborough-Street , and lost the Care of it to me . The Prisoner Turner came and told me , that he wanted to see the House , for a Gentleman of his Acquaintance having a mind to take one thereabouts . I told him the Painters were at work there , and they would let him see it . William Londall . I and my Son-in-law were doing the Painter 's work in Mr. Webb 's Back-house . There 's a Garden betwixt the Back-house and the Fore-house . The 2 Prisoners came and desired to see the Fore-house , I told 'em they might go in , and they went ; but soon after they were gone , says I to my Son , I have something comes upon my Mind , that these are not honest Men , is there any thing loose about the House that they can take away ? There 's nothing , says he , but the Brass Locks that lie in the Window . So I went after them , but they were gone ; I saw the Chain was taken off the Street-Door . I presently open 'd the Door , and looking out , I saw them both running down the Street . I call 'd to my Son , he jump 'd down from a Scaffold 12 Foot high , and came running to me . He look 'd in the Window , and by God , says he , they have got the Locks ! we pursu 'd them to Tyburn-Road , crying out , stop Theif ! stop Red-Coat and Blue-Coat . They run hard , and at the turning a Corner , they dropt a Bag with the Locks in it , and were soon after taken . Joseph Holdsworth . I and my Father-in-law , pursu 'd them down Poland-Street , in Tyburn-Road . They run into Chappel-Street , and just as they had turn 'd the Corner , I heard the Locks fall . I cry 'd stop Thief , and Turner was stopp 'd by Mr. Stanton , who was drinking at the George Alehouse Door , in Chappel-Street . Eversbet run down a Coach-Yard , and hid himself . We found 2 Brass-Locks on the Dunghill , and his Red-Coat was lying upon the Little-House . After some search we found him in a Hay-Loft . George Stanton . I was sitting on Horse-back at the George Door , when Turner came running along in a Blue Rug-Coat , I saw him drop the Bag from under his Coat . I quitted my Horse and took him . William Beaumont . I was with Mr. Stanton , I took up the Bag , and I swear that this is one of the Locks that was in it . John Young . And these are all Mr. Webb 's Locks . The Defence of the Prisoners . Prisoners . We are Painters by Trade , and went to see the House , and while we were in it , some People coming by , and reading the Bill at the Door , they desir 'd to see it too . We told them they might and welcome , for it would not do for us , and so we let 'em in , and left them there . John Coventry , Painter . The Prisoners have both work 'd for me : they have been trusted in Gentlemen 's Houses , and I never heard any Complaints of them . The Jury found them Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. each . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 14 , 15 , 16. Elizabeth Yates , Henry Richardson , and Isaac Coxen , of Islington , were indicted , Yates for stealing with Abigal Freeman , not yet taken , a Linen Wallet , value 6 s. and 21 pair of Stockings , value 40 s. the Goods of John Harris , June 10 , and Richardson and Coxon for receiving ( with Joseph Matthews not yet taken ) the said Goods , knowing them to be stolen . John Harris , I sell Stockings about the Country . I had been at Barnet-Market , and coming towards London , along with a Cloth-man , we call 'd in at a Brandy-Shop in Islington , and drank a Quartern of Brandy together . Betty Yates , and her Sister Abigal Freeman liv 'd next Door to this Shop . They owed me 7 s. and being so near I thought I might as well call for my Money . And so I parted with the Cloth-man , and taking my Wallet of Stockings with me , I went in . They pretended to be over-joy 'd to see me , and Abigal bid her Sister Betty go for a full Pot of Beer ; may , says I , if you send for one Pot , I will send for another , and so we had 2 Pots . It was then between 10 and 11 at Night , and being so late I drank once , and but once , and would go to London ; so I went down Stairs , and out of Doors , and the 2 Women follow 'd . When I was got about 10 Yards from the House , they laid hold of me , and said , that I should go no farther , for fear I should be robb 'd , or come to some Mischief . I told them I would go , and they said again , that I should not , and so they took away my Wallet , and carry 'd it in a Doors ; I follow 'd them , they bolted the Door as soon as I came in , and then they went up Stairs with my Goods , and I after them . Court . Did they use any Violence , or threaten you when they took your Wallet ? Harris . No ; I was not afraid of the Women ; but when I came up and ask 'd for my Goods , great Harry said , If I made a Noise there he would do me a Mischief . He ha . Court . Who is great Harry ? Harris . The biggest of the Prisoners - Harry - let me see - Richardson . Court . Who else was there ? Court . There was Joseph Matthews , who is out upon Bail ; Samuel Sneesby , who is not yet indicted , because he was taken up since the rest ; Abigal Freeman , but she 's gone off , the Prisoner Betty Yates , and the Baker . Court . What Baker ? Harris . That other Prisoner there ; I forget his Name - stay - 't is Cock - Cock - Coxon - Isaac Coxon . Coxon . Was I in the Room then ? Harris . I do n't know whether you was there then or no ; but I found you there afterwards when I came up again with the Constable . Court . Was there any light in the Room ? Harris . There was no Candle , but there was a little Glimpse of Day-Light . Court . What was in your Wallet when the Women took it away ? Harris . I had a large Parcel of Stockings , I ca n't remember how many Pair ; but I can be positive to 7 Pair of fine Hose in particular , which stood me in 4 s. 6 d. a Pair prime cost . Court . Were your Goods in the Room when you first went up ? Harris . Yes ; but they were soon thrown out of the Window ; and I never set Eyes on any of them afterwards , except these a Pair and an odd one , which were pick 'd up near the House by the Watchman , and this Fellow to the odd One , which Sneeshy had sold . I call 'd to the Woman below , and said , I was robb 'd , and wanted some Body to fetch a Constable ; but she could not go out , because her Husband was sick a-Bed , and had no Body but her to look after him ; so I went down my self , and before I got out , I heard 2 Men jump out of the Window . The Woman open 'd the Street Door , and I went out and stood there with my Knife in my Hand , and swore I would stick the next Man that came out of the Door or the Window ; and there I staid till the Watch came up , which was at 2 in the Morning . Benjamin Foxley , Watchman . As I was beating 2 a-Clock , I heard the Prosecutor call , Watch ! Watch ! I went to him and he said , he had been robb 'd by 2 Women , and some Men above Stairs , and wanted a Constable , I told him the Constable was gone home , and he must take care of them himself , so I left him ; but as I was going along beating the Hour , I found 2 pair of Stockings and an odd one in the Road , about 50 Yards from the House . Then I thought the Man had been robb 'd in good earnest ; so I went and call 'd the Constable , and when we came up we found them , the Prisoner Betty Yates , her Sister Nab Freeman , Joseph Matthews , who was in Bed , and the Baker , he at the Bar there , the least of the 2 Men ; I do n't know his Name . These are the Stockings that I found . Harris . These are some of the Stockings that I lost ; and here 's the Fellow to the odd one that Sneeshy sold for a pennyworth of Bread and Cheese , and a ha'porth of Small Beer , as he was going to Deptford . William Nicholson , Beadle . The Watchman call 'd me at 11 , but he not having a proper Officer , I refused to obey ; and about 2 he came again with the Constable , and then I got up . We took the 2 Women , and 2 of the Men , the Hemp-dresser and the Baker ; but Sneeshy and the Prisoner Richardson had got off ; however we took Richardson in less than 2 Hours afterwards . For he coming again to the House , to enquire what was become of his Companions , a Woman told us of it , and we went and took him . He swore , damn him , he would not go to Jail , for he never was in a Jail in his life ; and indeed he had like to have been too hard for us , but my Dog kept him under . Mr. Sorrow , the Constable , would have been here , but poor Man , he 's gone aside , he 's under a Colour , and ca n't appear . The Prisoners Defence . Elizabeth Yates . I hope he has nothing to lay to my Charge , for what I did was only out of kindness to take care of his Goods . Isaac Coxon . I was going home to my Lodging , and hearing a Disturbance , I went in with the Constable and Watch to see what was the Matter , and as soon as I was got up , the Prosecutor charged me . Henry Richardson . I had been drinking at the King's-Head , in Islington , and from thence I went to Betty Yates 's , and there I found the Prosecutor drinking with the 2 Women and 2 Men , so suddled , that he could neither go no stand , and if he did lose any Goods , they might be lost before I came ; I left 'em drinking together between 10 and 11 , and went down Stairs , and therefore if any Body jump 'd out of Window , it must have been the other 2 Men ; and he offer 'd to make it up with me for 30 s. I was a Servant to a Distiler , and got my living honestly . Prosecutor . It was you and Sneesby that jumpt out at Window . Richardson . Did you see us ? Prosecutor . No ; but I left you both above , and you got out while I went down Stairs , I watch 'd at the Door till I came up again with the Constable , and then you were both gone ; as for being drunk , I had drank but one Pot of Beer , and part of a Quartern of Gin before I came there . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 17. Samuel Sneesby was [ next Day ] indicted for stealing a Wallet , value 6 s. and 21 pair of Worsted Stockings , value 40 s. the Goods of John Harris , June 10 . John Harris . The two Women took away my Wallet , and carry 'd it up Stairs . P follow 'd , and there I found the Prisoner , and Richardson and Matthews . The Prisoner , and Richardson escaped out at Window , and I could never find who the Prisoner was till last Sessions ; we took up Matthews , and he told us where to find him . The Prisoner confess 'd that he had sold 2 pair of Stockings , and an odd one , as he was going to Deptford . I ask 'd him how he came by them ? He said , when he got out of Window , he jump 'd upon them , and some others , which he took up and carry 'd off ; but he dropt some of them in the Road . William Nicholson , Beadle . When the Prisoner was in St. Giles 's Round House , he confess 'd that he was concern 'd in taking the Stockings , and that he drop 'd some of them in the Road . Foxly , Watchman . As the Prisoner was going to the Round House , he confess 'd to me , that Betty-Yates turn 'd him out of the Window , and shew 'd him the way over the Wall , where she had thrown the Stockings ; and told him , if he did not go that way , the Constable and Watch would meet him ; that he got over the Wall , and stept on several pair of Stockings , which he took up , but drop 'd some of them in going along , and the Remainder which was 2 pair and an odd one he sold to a Woman at Deptford . I shew 'd him these other 2 pair of Stockings and an odd one , which I found in Islington Road , and he said , that he believ 'd these were the same that he drop 'd . This odd one that I found , and this odd one which he sold at Deptford are Fellows . Prisoner . I was drinking at the King's-Head in Islington with Long Harry , and he went and fetch 'd Betty Yates , and after we had staid some time together , she asked us to go up to her Room , and so we went ; and when we came there , the Prosecutor and Abby Freeman were lying upon the Bed together . Long Harry ask 'd me to spend a Penny , which I agreed to , and then I and Harry went to Bed together . Then Abigal Freeman got off the Bed where she was lying with the Prosecutor , and went down Stairs . He got up soon after , and came to me , and swore he had been robb 'd , and would secure us all , and so he went down Stairs . Betty Yates then came up , and I said to her , sure you ha n't robb 'd him . She told me , if I would be safe , I must get out of Window , and so I did ; but I was afterwards taken from my work , at Mr. Francis 's Shop , a Hatter in Newtoner's-Lane . Harris . I neither was on the Bed nor in a Chair , for I did not stay a Quarter of an Hour in the Room , but went down Stairs , they had secur 'd the Door , but the Woman below open 'd it for me , and told me , that 2 of the Men were getting out of the Window ; and I stood with my Penknise in my Hand , to keep the rest from going the same way . Edward Lobb and William Lobb . We heard the Prosecutor say , that he never saw the Prisoner till he was taken up , and that was 10 Weeks after the Fact . Several Witnesses gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest , civil , sober Man . Acquitted . 18 , 19. Abigal Freeman , and Joseph Matthews , were indicted , she for stealing a Wallet and 21 pair of Stockings , the Goods of John Harris , and he for receiving the same , knowing them to be stolen , June 10 . John Harris . About 11 at Night I called upon Abigal Freeman and Betty Yates for 7 s. which my Wife had lent them when they lived hard by us in Southwark . What Mr. Harris , says Abigal , I am heartily glad to see you , I will send for a Pot to make you drink , and so she did , and I sent for another , and I drank once and went down . The 2 Women followed me , and took away my Wallet of Stockings under pretence that they were afraid I should be robbed . Says I , robb 'd or robb 'd not I will go to London this blessed Night . They said I should not , and so they carried my Wallet in again , and Upstairs I followed them , and there I found Harry Richardson , Sam Sneeshy , and the Prisoner , but I knew none of them ; but I saw my Goods no more , for they were thrown out at Window , as Sam Sneeshy told me afterwards . I desir 'd the Woman to let me have my Goods again , and they and the Men said , so I should if I would stay till Morning . Court . Did not you behave your self in a friendly Way with the Woman , without making any Complaints of being robb 'd ? Harris . No farther than to ask for my Goods , for I am sure I never buss 'd her Lips , nor took her by the Hand , nor touch 'd her Flesh any where else . I did not stay there a Quarter of an Hour , but went down and staid watching without the Door 3 Hours , from a 11 till 2 . Nicholson , the Beadle . We found the Prisoners and Betty Yates in the Room together , and soon after we saw Coxon there too . We ask 'd the Prosecutor which of'em he charged ? and he said , All . So we carry 'd them to the Cage , and about 4 a-Clock the same Morning we met Richardson . He begun to rifle at me , and swore damn him , he would not go with us to the Cage ; but however we made him , and as soon as Abigal saw him , she cry 'd , and said , this is all along of you , if you had not jump 'd out of Window , we had never been brought hither . The Prisoners Defence . Abigal Freeman . The Prosecutor came about Dusk . I was undressing my self in order to go to Bed . He sent for one Pot , and I sent for another . We sat drinking about an Hour and a Half , it was then near 10 a Clock ; we went to the Chandler's-Shop for a Dram ; he was very much suddled , and my Husband not being at home , I desir 'd him to stay all Night and lie in my Bed , and I would lie with my Sister . So I got him Upstairs . Coxon and Richardson lodg 'd at my House , Richardson and the Prosecutor join 'd together for a full Pot of Two-penny ; I left 'em drinking , and went to see a Neighbour who was not well . I return 'd about 11 and went to Bed , and knew no more of the matter till about 3 in the Morning , when I was waked by the Prosecutor . Joseph Matthews . Going along Islington a Saturday Night I met Betty Yates ; 't is very dark young Man , says she , pray be so kind as to see me home . I went with her , and when we came to the Door she invited me in , but I told her it was late , and I could not stay . I am sorry for that , says she , but when shall I see you again to make you amends for your Civility in taking care of me ? To-Morrow 's Sunday , sure you 'll have some time to spare then . I told her I was engag 'd . The n come on Monday , says she . I promiss 'd her I would , and so on Monday Evening I went to the King 's Head Alehouse in Islington , and sent for her . She came , and after we had staid there sometime , I told her I wanted a Lodging ; she said I might lye at her Sister 's ; I agreed , and when we came thither , the Prosecutor was lying upon the Bed with Abigal . Abigal . He never was a-bed with me that I know of , for I was fast asleep . Court . Was not you at all upon the Bed with Abigal ? [ to the Prosecutor . ] Harris . No ; I did not so much as sit with her , but just while we were drinking . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 20.

I went to the Watch-house , and found my Man 's Wife ( the other Prisoner ) there .

Mr. Harding . I employ 'd the Prisoner as a Chairwoman at my Chambers in the Middle Temple ; I miss 'd several odd Things , but did not immediately suspect her . It happen 'd one Day that I had not a Shirt to put on , tho ' I had bought 7 new ones which cost me about 30 s. a-piece but 3 Weeks before . I examin 'd her about it , and she told me , some were soul , and others were at Washing . This put me upon a farther Search , not one of these 7 Shirts was to be found . A large Silver Spoon and 2 Tea-spoons , several Neck-cloths , Handkerchiefs , and other Things were missing . Next Morning when she came up to light my Fire , I tax 'd her closely ; she fell on her Knees , and said , for God Sake do n't ruin me ! I ask 'd her what she had done with my Shirts , my Neckcloths , my Handkerchiefs and Spoons ? She said , they were at pawn , and that her Husband had tempted her to carry them , and if I would forgive her , she would confess more Things than I knew of . Prisoner . Did not you deliver me the Shirts to wash ? Mr. Harding . No ; I never order 'd you either to wash , or to get wash 'd any Shirts since those 7 were made . Mr. Nelthorp , Constable . By Mr. Harding 's Order I went with her to Jarvis 's the Pawn-brokers on Newstreet-hill to fetch out 4 Shirts . I carried 2 Guineas for that Purpose , but understanding when I came thither , that there was a Silver Spoon likewise in pawn , and the 2 Guineas not being sufficient to fetch that out too , the Prisoner pawn 'd her own Gold Ring to redeem it . These are the 4 Shirts , they were deliver 'd to me by Jarvis in the Prisoner 's Presence , and by her Direction . Mr. Harding . And these 4 Shirts are para of those I lost . Nelthorp . She own 'd too , that she had pawn 'd four of Mr. Harding 's Neckcloths and 2 of his Shaving Cloths in Black-Fryars ; but she said , she could not remember at what House it was . This white Callico Waistcoat was deliver 'd me Yesterday Morning ( without paying for ) by Jarvis . The Prisoner said ; she did not remember where she had pawn 'd it , but he happen 'd to find it enter 'd in his Books to her Name . Edmund Weller , the Prosecutor 's Servant . The Prisoner own 'd to me that she took the Shirts , and 2 or 3 Shaving Cloths , and some Towels , and pawn 'd them ; and she said , that , her Husband came and beat her , and took a Shirt and a black Suit of my Master 's Cloaths , and put them on , and went away with them . Prisoner . Did not Mr. Harding deliver me the Shirts to wash ? Weller . No . Prisoner . Did he not give me 1 Shirt to get the Ink out of it ? Weller . No ; there was 1 Shirt indeed that had been ink 'd , and my Master gave it me to get the Ink out , and I spoke to you about it , but did not deliver it to you : Besides , you said you knew of several other Things that had not yet been miss 'd , but that you would not name them till they were miss 'd , and when they were , you said , you would not disown them . Prisoner . He pretends I took a couple of Tea-spoons too , because when I was cleaning the Plate , I said I could not find them . Weller . When I ask 'd her for the Tea-spoons , she said , she had put them in her Pocket , and carry 'd them home . Prisoner . The Day before the Spoons were missing we had had Peas for Dinner , and the Spoons were then in Use ; and some of his Companions came to see him at Night ( as they often did when my Master was out of the way ) and he treated them with a Bottle of my Master 's Wine , and they were as likely to take the Spoons as any Body else . Mr. Harding . When I ask 'd her what was become of the Spoons , I did not name any Spoon in particular , but spoke in general Terms , and she told me they were in pawn . Prisoner . Did I own that I stole them ? Mr. Harding . You confess 'd that you had taken them away and pawn 'd them . Mr. Burker . When Mr. Harding examin 'd the Prisoner about his Shirts , Towels , and other Things that he had lost , she said , if you 'll have Patience I 'll tell you . where they are . I have pawn 'd 'em , I am sorry for it , and ask your Pardon , but it was a Rogue of a Husband that persuaded me to it . Prisoner . While I was in the Compter , I was swell 'd up with the Poison that my Husband gave me , so that I miscarry 'd and was like to dye ; and being in this Condition I sent to the Prosecutor , desiring him to let me have my Wages , but he sent me Word back , that he would stop it on Account of the Shirts . Mr. Harding . She indeed sent to me for her Wages , which was not then due , and she having wrong 'd me so much , I thought I had no Reason to send it . Prisoner . I had some Witnesses here Yesterday , but now they are gone . Court . You was call 'd up to take your Tryal Yesterday , but then you desir 'd it might be put off till to Day , because your Witnesses were not come . Prisoner . No ; my Husband and I were called up together , and it was he that desired his Tryal might be put off , because he had not got all the Witnesses that he had hired to swear for him . The Jury found her guilty of the Indictment . Death . 29.

A Bermudas Hat lin 'd with red Silk , a narrow Brim , and Hat-band curiously wrought with Bugles and Silk . A small Pestle and Mortar . A Copper-pot , & c. Court . You may refresh your Memory by looking on it , but it is not to be read in Evidence . Mr. Carrey .

One of these Advertisements being left at Mr. Askew ( a Goldsmith ) 's he came to me on the Friday Morning following . with this Silver Spoon of mine , which he said the Prisoner , Amy Mason , offer 'd to sell him . Mason , alias Davis , alias Griffith , being taken , and ca rried before Justice Robe , she impeach 'd Marshall and his Wife , the 2 other Prisoners . Marshall 's Wife said she had the Goods of John Griffin , alias King John , who goes for Mason 's Husband . I immediately published fresh Advertisements + for Apprehending him , with a Reward of 2 Guineas on his being secured , and 3 more on his Conviction . He was taken by Mr. Parker , to whom I paid the 2 Guineas as promised . King John immediately confess 'd this Fact , and that he and Marshal had robbed Justice Robe too , about 2 Year ago + London , September 30 , 1732 . Whereas John Griffin , alias King John , a Blacksmith by Trade , has been concern 'd with Others ( now in Custody ) in breaking open the House of Henry Carey , and robbing him of Houshold Goods , & c. which said Griffin is a short , square , well-set Man , about Thirty-five Years of Age , much pitted with the Small-pox , round Vizage , his Hair short , thick , and curling , of a very dark Brown , his common Apparel a striped Flanel Waistcoat , and a Leather-Apron ; if he wears a Coat , which is seldom , 't is generally a Snuff-colour 'd Camblet , and for the most Part open and unbutton 'd , but he has several Disguises ; sometimes he appears like a Countryman , a Sailor , a Butcher , & c.

H. CAREY . N.B . He was seen Yesterday , neatly Drest , in a new Suit of Light-colour 'd Cloth , or Drugget . If taken in the Country , reasonable Charges shall be allow 'd . Richard Marshall . I was not at Home when the Goods were brought to my House ; but when I came in , my Wife told me , that Griffin had left a Box of Goods , and that his Wife had left a Sword and a Hat . Mr. Carey . He at first deny 'd , that he knew any thing of the Matter ; and then he said , that he had the spoon of Amy Davis ; and she said , she had it of him . We found several of the Goods at his House , and some of them were brought in after the first Search was made ; for upon the second Search , I found my two Swords in a Cupboard , which I had examin 'd very strictly the first Time . We found this Iron Hand-crow too , with which Griffin confess 'd , that he and Marshall wrench 'd open the Grate of my Cellar-window . Richard Askew . Amy Mason brought this Silver Spoon to my Shop to sell , and the Crest answering the Advertisement , I examin 'd her where she had it ? She said , it was her Mother 's , and she had it 3 Years . I asked her Name , and where she liv 'd . She said , her Name was Amy Mason , and she lived at Cow-cross , and that my Neighbour , Mr. Swain , knew her . I went with her to Mr. Swain 's , and he said , he knew her Name was Mason , that she lived at Cow-cross , and that her Husband was a Barber . Upon hearing this , I did not secure her ; but I went however to Mr. Carey , who owned the Spoon . R. Marshall . Was not Griffin with her when she brought the Spoon ? Askew . There was a Man who stood at the Door , but I do n't know who he was . King John . Dick Marshall and I went out between 11 and 12 , on Tuesday Night , and just as the Watch had gone 12 , we came to Mr. Carey 's House ; we wrenched the Wooden Bat of the Cellar-window , and forced open the 2 Bolts , and risted the Kitchen . Marshall took this Silver Spoon out of the Cupboard . Court . How do ye know it is the same Spoon ? John . By this Mark . Court . Did you look on it , when he first took it ? John . No , not till we came home . We went away with as many Things as we could carry , and then came again ; and going up one Pair of Stairs , I turned the Brass Thing of the Door about , and a Woman called out , Who 's there ? And so we made off , and left 2 Brass Candlesticks , and a Piece of Hung Beef ; and I went to Bed , but Dick Marshall went again , and fetch 'd the Candlesticks , and the Hung Beef , and a Leg of Pork , and we boiled the Pork next Day . Court . How do you know that he went for these Things ? John . He told me so . Court . What else did you take ? John . A Box of Linen , a Copper Coffee-pot , a Tea-pot , 4 Brass Candlesticks , 2 Pewter Dishes , 11 Plates , and 2 other Pewter Plates , one was a Water-plate , and the other had Writing round it , but I do n't know what , for I ca n't read . We put the Pewter and Brass in a Bag , and I took the Box , and carried it to Dick 's House . In the Morning he comes to my Wife as she was a-bed , and said , Here Amy , here 's a Silver Spoon for you . But she was afraid to meddle with it . Well , says he , then my Wife shall have it . But both of them neglecting to dispose of it , I got up on Friday Morning , and swore if my Wife would not go and sell it , I would break her Neck , and so I pull 'd her out of bed , and made her carry it to the Goldsmith 's , and there she was stopt . A Juryman . After you were disturbed by the Woman 's crying , Who 's there ? how came Marshall to venture a third Time ? John . We had put the Things without Side the House before I went up Stairs , so that he had no occasion to go in a doors the last Time . His Wife knew how we came by the Goods , and that made her afraid to sell the Spoon ; and therefore , as I said , I was forced to make my Wife go out with it . Court . Who do you call Wife ? John . Amy , the Prisoner ; she 's my Wife , I married her at Cripplegate Church . R. Marshall . He was another Wife , and 4 or 5 Children by her . James Murdock . Mr. Swain having told Mr. Askew the Goldsmith , that he knew Amy Mason , I went with Mr. Carey to Swain 's House , to enquire after her . He was not at Home , and his Wife said , that he knew but little of her , But when he was before Justice Robe , the Justice asked him , if he knew Mason ? and he said , he had seen her about 20 Times . Then , says the Justice , you must know where she lives , and if you do n't find her , I 'll commit you . While his Mittimus was making , a Woman came to speak with him , and he directed us to where Mason was . We took her , and then we secured Dick Marshall , and searched his House . Up one pair of Stairs backwards , we found a little Trunk . Mary Marshall told us , these was nothing in it , but we open 'd it , and found the Boy 's Hat , this Bermadas Hat , and this Table-cloth . We could find nothing more at that Time , but R. Marshall being carried before Justice Robe , and committed , we went again , and then we found this Pestle and Mortar . Michael Guy . I went ( by Direction of Mr. Wood , who was Marshall 's Landlord ) to make a Distress upon Marshall 's Goods for Rent . and there I found this Shift , mark 'd M. C. And remembring by Mr. Carey 's Advertisement , that such Shifts had been lost out of his House suspected that this was one of them , and that made me search more narrowly . In a Wig-box in the Shop , I found these two Candlesticks and this Pewter Cover , and a loaded Pistol . I met with this other Pair of Candlesticks in a Bundle under the Dresser , and above Stairs I found a Ham in a Bag : Here it is . Mrs. Harrison . This Bermudas Hat is mine It was lost out of Mr. Carey 's House . Court . It is laid in the Indictment to be the Goods of Henry Harrison . Mr. Carey . Her Husband 's Name is Henry Harrison . And the Boy 's Hat belongs to Thomas Halliwell my Lodger . Mary Chapman . This is my Shift , I lost this , and 3 more and 4 Aprons out of my Master Mr. Carey 's House . Mr. Carey . The rest of the Goods are mine .

And Mary Marshall , for receiving two China Cups , and one Brass Candlestick ; and Amy Griffin for receiving 1 Table-cloth , part of the said Goods , they knowing them to be stolen . Mr. Robe . In the Morning of the 31st of August was a Twelve-Month , News was brought me , that my House at Islington was broke open , and my Goods taken away . I had just furnish 'd it , with an Intention of sending my Children thither . I went to see what Condition the House was in . I found the Doors all forced open , and that the Furniture was carried off . Mr. Carey 's House being robb 'd , I granted him a Warrant to search for his Goods , and in that Search some of my Goods were found . Michael Guy . When I went to make Distress in the Prisoner Richard Marshall 's House , for Rent due to Mr. Wood the Landlord , I found these China Cups , and this Brass Candlestick , which Mr. Robe swears to be his . Martha Harrison . This is my Master 's Candlestick , and these Knives and Forks I believe to be his , and the same that were in his House at Islington . John Prizmore . And these Knives and Forks I bought of the Prisoner Richard Marshall . John Newnham . This Table-cloth was pawn 'd to me in the Name of Amy Griffin ; but I am not certain whether it was she or her Sister that brought it . Martha Harrison . This is my Master 's Table cloth . John Griffin . One Night , between 11 and 12 , about the latter-end of August was a 12 Month , Dick Marshal and I went to the Prosecutor 's House at Islington . We got over the Wall into the next Garden , and there we found a Gun . Then we went to the Garden-house Door , and broke it open with an Iron Crow , and there we found a China Decanister , and a Pewter Cover . Then we broke open all the other Doors that stood in our Way , and rumaged the House from Top to Bottom . We took the Bedding and Pewter , and Brass , and what else we could come at , and carried them all to Dick 's House , and most of them were sold from thence . The Bed and Bolster , and one of the Blankets were sold to Mr. Worth . Eliz . Thornton . I bought a Dish and 5 Plates of Elizabeth Green , thinking they had been her own , and now Justice Robe claims them . Martha Harrison . These are Mr. Robe 's Dishes and Plates ; they were taken from his House at Islington . Eliz . Green . I was employ 'd to sell Plates in the Name of John Griffin . He said he and his Wife was fell out . He sold a Featherbed and a Bolster , and a Blanket , to Mr. Worth upon Saffron-Hill . Mr. Worth . I am a Broker . Eliz . Green came and told me , that a Man and his Wife at Mr. Marshall 's , were sell out , and that the Man was resolved to sell the Bed . I had known Mr. Marshall 10 or 12 Years . He kept a House at Cow-cross , and paid Scot and Lot , and lived in Credit , and no Body would have disputed to have bought any thing of him . So I went and bought the Bed for 35 s. and I could not afford to give more ; for I had a Sale at Islington not long after , and I sent this Bed thither , and allow 'd it at 40 s. but no body would give so much , and so I was forced to bring it home again . R. Marshall . This Griffin has been reckon 'd a Thief for these 5 and 20 Years , and he has brought so many People into Trouble only to save himself . Eliz . Green told me , that he and his Wife had sell out , and upon that Pretence he brought these Goods to my House , and told me that he had them from Holloway , and was resolved to sell them , and so I sent Eliz . Green to Mr. Worth 's and he came and bought the Bed . The Jury acquitted the 2 Women , and found Rich . Marshall guilty of the Indictment . Death . 46. John Booker of St. Mary Matselon , alias White-Chapel , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Snuff-box , value 12 s. the Goods of Samuel Collet , from the Person of his Wife Elizabeth Collet , Octob . 4 . Eliz . Collet . About 4 in the Afternoon , I was standing near the Nag's-Head-Inn-Gate , in White-Chapel , to see a Funeral pass by , when the Prisoner , and another Man came and stood close before me , so that . I look 'd betwixt their Heads . Says the Prisoner to me , 'T is a very hand on Burying . I wonder whether 't is a Maid or a Batchelor . Those are fine Srutcheous ; do but look , Madam ! I look 'd as long as I car 'd for , and then turning about to go away , I perceived that the Prisoner , with his Hands behind him , had got hold of my Pocket . He had a Penknife in his Hand , and my Pocket was cut ; and with his Fingers in the Slit , he was pulling out my Snuff-box . I actually saw him take it . You Rogue , says I , you have got my Box ! Damn your Eyes , you Bitch , says he , speak such another Word , and I 'll sacrifice you ? I took hold of his Arm ; he struck me several Times on the Stomach . I still held him . He threw something over my Head , and said , Damn you , you Bitch , there 's your Box , Some of the People cry 'd , that 's none of it . I look 'd , and saw it still in his Hand . It was the Penknife that he threw away , for it self in a Puddle , and a little Girl pick 'd it up . Then he let the Box fall , and twisting himself about , he got from me , and ran cross the Way into a Court ; telling the People he was pursu 'd by the Bailiff 's , and begging them to hide him . He was taken and carry 'd into Mr. Cave 's , the Constable 's House ; I follow 'd , and sitting down at a Table opposite to him , he begun to use better Language . It was not Bitch now , but Madam ; Madam , says he , I beg you would not take my Life away . Court . Did any Body else hear him say these Words ? Mrs. Collet . I question whether they did or no , for when he said so , he leaned over the Table , and whisper 'd to me . Prisoner . When you first took hold of me , and looked in my Face , did you not say , that you was mistaken , and I was the wrong Person ? Mrs. Collet . No , I said no such thing . I charged you with it , and you damned my Eyes for a Bitch . Mary Knight . As I was standing at the Nag's-Head Gate , to see a Funeral that was coming from Bromley ; the Prisoner pass 'd by me , and said , it 's a very fine Burying , if you do but view it well . Mrs. Collet was standing against an Oyl-Shop , and he went and stood close before her . I saw him put his Left-hand into his Pocket , and take out this Clasp-pen-knife , and look on it thus ; and then he put his Hands behind him . Mrs. Collet presently took hold of his Arm , and said , he had got her Snuff-Box . Damn your Eyes , you Bitch , says he , speak such a Word again , and I 'll make a Sacrifice of you . Then he threw away the Knife ; it fell in a Puddle of Water , and a Girl took it up . The People said , that 's not the Box , and with that he threw the Box down , and as Mrs. Collet was stooping to take it up , he got from her , and went a-cross the Way , into a Court that had no Thorow-fare , and there he was stopt . I follow 'd and heard him say to Mrs. Collet , You do it to take my Life away ; but pray , Madam , do n't say that I am the Man , for I live in repute . John Cater . As the Prisoner stood before Mrs. Collet , I saw her fly at him , and catch hold of his Collar ; he threw the Knife over her into a Puddle of Water 2 or 3 Yards off , and a Girl took it up . Mrs. Collet stoop 'd to take up her Box , and he sprung away from her , and got into Elephant and Castle-Alley , which being no thorow-fare , he was taken and carry 'd into Mr. Cave 's House . Court . Did you hear any thing that he said to the Prosecutrix in Cave 's House ' Cater . No ; but I know she sat over-against him . Prisoner . If you saw me throw the Knife away , why did you not take me directly ? Cater . I had a Child in my Arms , but I gave it to my Wife , and then follow 'd you . Prisoner . Did I run ? Cater . Yes , when you first got from her , but you walk 'd slower afterwards . Prisoner . I had been at New-Fair , at Mile-End , and coming back thro ' White-Chapel , I bought a ha'porth of Walnuts , and eating them as I went along , the Prosecutor , all on a sudden , seiz 'd me by my Coat ; I ask 'd her , what was the Matter ? She look 'd in my Face , and said , I beg your Pardon ; you are the wrong Person . Being seiz 'd in such a manner , it put me into such a fright , that I occasion to ease my self , upon which I went over the Way into a Yard , and ask 'd a Woman , who was standing there with a Child in her Arms , if she knew of any necessary House thereabouts ? Before she had answer 'd me , the Prosecutor , and a Mob with her , came up and seiz 'd me ; and they said , I belong 'd to the Bailiffs , and they would make me kiss the Shitten Brick-bat in Harrow-Alley . Miles Rivet . Near Catherine-Wheel-Alley , in White-Chapel , a Woman seiz 'd the Prisoner , and charged him with something about a Snuff-Box , and she said , as how she mought be mistaken , and so he walk 'd away , and I thought , he dud not go off much like a Thief nother ; I knew his Father and he too , and I never knew no Harm of 'em . And there was two Men stood before the Woman , and I believe she dud not know to which on 'em had the Box , and that one of 'em is no more to me than the t'other . Thomas Williams . I saw the Woman catch his Arm . and say , Ye Rogue , I am robb 'd . Hussy , says he , what do you mean ? And with that she look 'd in his Face , and said , I beg your Pardon , I believe you are not the Man . So he went away . and some butcherly Fellows follow 'd , and brought him into an Alehouse . And a Man in a Livery called her out , and said , Why do you let this Man go ? If you prosecute him , you 'll have the Reward . Court . That Man was mistaken ; there 's no Reward for taking Pickpockets . Mary Matthe ws . I and Margaret Creed were a going to Rag-Fair , for you must know we buy and sell Things , and go Partners together ; and so there was a Mob at the Justice 's Door , and this John Cater was among 'em : And so seeing this Mob , we stood to argue , as others may do , for we was willing to know how and about it . And so as I was a saying , says this John Cater , I believe it was he that took the Box , or others that belong 'd to him ; but I do n't know him certainly ; but it 's all one for that ; there 's 140 l. to be got by the Bargain . John Cater . I never said any such thing , nor ever saw this Woman before , to my Knowledge . Margaret Creed . I see a Croud of People about the Justice 's Door , and so says I to Cater , What 's the Matter ? Why , says he , here 's a Woman has had her Pocket cut , and this Man ( the Prisoner ) and another were standing close by her when it was done . We are not sure that this Man did it , but the other is got away . And the Woman said she could not swear it was the Prisoner , because there was another with him . And Cater said , they should have 140 l. if they hang 'd him . And ar'n't you a parjur 'd Rogue , says I , to go to swear away a Man 's Life for the Reward ? Go along , Hussy , says he , or I 'll kick your Arse for ye . Sarah Webster . I was at the Swan Alehouse by Hicks 's Hall , with the Prisoner 's Mother , and the Prosecutor . We said , Are you sure he 's the Man ? And the Prosecutor answer 'd , I am as sure as can be , but I would not have sworn it , if my Evidences had not prest me to it , and told me it would be my Ruin if I did not . Robert Gilman . The Constable not being in the Way , Mrs. Collet charged me with the Prisoner , and the Prisoner 's Wife and Mother wanted me to go out of the Way , because I had the Knife , and the Pocket , and the Snuff-box . Here they are . Pris . One Mr. Kenter heard Gilman say , if they would give 5 or 6 Guineas , the Prosecutor would go into the Country , and not appear . Gilman . 'T is no such Thing ; but on the contrary , they offer 'd me Money . William Hewit . The Prisoner is a Weaver : I have known him several Years , and never knew any Harm of him before . The Jury found him guilty of the Indictment . Death . 41 , 42. Thomas Headly [ Edly ] and Henry Chapman , of Mary le bon , were indicted for assaulting George Young in an open Place near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Hat , Value 8 s. a Wig , Value 30 s. a Cane , Value 5 s. and 15 d. July 30 . George Young . On Thursday July 20. about a Quarter past 9 in the Evening , in the first Field coming out of Marybon Walks , I saw the a Prisoners and another Man lying upon the Grass at some Distance , and 2 Women near them ; when they saw me , the Men got up , and the Women went off . When the Men met me , one of them ask 'd me , what was a Clock ? I said , I could not tell . You lye , damn you , says he . Do n't damn me , says I . God damn it , says Headly , the Dog mutters , let 's thump him . With that I took to my Heels , and they after me , and when I came near the Bason , Headly struck me with a Stick and fell 'd me ; then Chapman clapt one Hand to my Mouth ; and the other to my Coat Pocket , while Headly took my Tye Wig , my Hat and my Cane , and the other Man rumaged my other Pockets . I lost a Shilling out of one of my Breeches Pockets , and 3 d. out of the other ; but being on the Ground I could not see which of them took the Money . After that , they threw me into the Bason , and said , Now lye there and he damned , and so they made off ; but a poor Man a Carpenter coming by , Aha ! says he , what are you going to drown your self ? and so he help 'd me out ; but for Blood and Dirt never was poor Creature so abused . I ask 'd the Carpenter where he liv 'd , that I might send for him upon Occasion to be an Evidence . He told me in Wardour-street , or Water-lane , I forget which , but I could not find him again . Court . Could you see the Prisoners plain enough to know 'em again ? Young . Yes ; it was as light as it is now . Court . What betwixt 9 and 10 at Night ? Young . It was light enough to diseern any Man living , and I am very certain to both the Prisoners . Court . Was it Moonlight ? Young . No . Court . Did it Rain ? Young . No . Court . It was full Moon but 3 Nights after . Was there no Company in the Fields when it was so fair and light ? Young . No ; it was a very windy Evening . A Juryman . Whither did you go after you got out of the Bason ? Young . I went with the Carpenter to Scavenger [ Cavendish ] Squar , and there I left him , and went directly to Mr . Pain 's the Distiller in Highstreet , St. Giles 's , but he was gone out , and I saw only his Boy at home . Court . Is the Boy here ? Young . No ; I was in such a dirty Condition when I went in there , that I look 'd more like a Blackguard than a Gentleman ; and there are so many Blackguards go to that Shop , that when I went there afterwards the Boy did not remember me from the rest of his Master 's Customers . No poor Creature was ever in such a Pickle . In short , I was asham 'd to go along the Streets , but however , I made Shift to get home at last . Sarah Lavender . Mr. Young came home near 10 at Night , without either Hat or Wig , or Cane ; he was very wet , and his Turnover and Stock very bloody . Thomas Lavender . I saw him when he came home ; his Stock and Turnover were all over bloody , and his Cloaths all wet . Court . Was his Coat dirty ? Lavender . Not very dirty . Court . Was it dirty at all ? Lavender . I ca n't say whether it was or no ; I did not take particular Notice . Elizabeth Trot . I lodge at Mr. Young 's House in Broad St. Giles 's ; I saw him come in , and his Wife was there then ; Lord , says she , what 's the matter ? where have you been ? Been , says he , why I have been robb 'd . Coming out of our Garden into Marybon-fields , I saw 3 Fellows lying upon the Grass , and 2 Women at a little Distance from them , the Women went off , and the Men came up and ask 'd what was a Clock ? I told them I did not know ; they swore I ly 'd , and threaten 'd to thump me ; I run from them , they follow 'd me to the rising Ground by the Bason , and there they knock 'd me down , took my Hat and Wig , and Cane and Money , and threw me into the Bason . Hugh Jones . I have known Mr. Young , the Prosecutor , he keeps an Apothecary 's Shop , and has the Character of as worthy , sober , and honest a Neighbour as any in the Parish . William Row , Watchman . Last Sunday Night , between 11 and 12 , as I was upon my Watch , the Prosecutor came to me , and said , he had seen two Men hard by , who had robb 'd him some time ago in Marybon-fields . I went with him , and he took one , and I took the other , near the New-Exchange . Court . Why did you not take them up before ? G. Young . Because I did not love Trouble , and had not done it now , but that I met them accidentally , for I never hunted after them ; tho ' several of my Friends offer 'd to go with me to Newgate , to enquire if no Body there knew such Persons , who committed such a Robbery ; and they said , they did not doubt , but I might hear of them . However I never went ; but it happen 'd last Sunday Night , as I was going home from the King's-Head Tavern , the Corner of - I saw one of the Prisoners leaning against a Post , in the Strand , opposite to the New-Exchange , and the other standing by him , knocking his Link against the Heel of his Shoe . As I past by , I heard one of them Mutter to the other , Damn you , there 's the Man we took the Hat and Wig from in Marybon-fields ! Court . 'T is very strange he should say so in your hearing . G. Young . So I seem 'd to take no notice , but went on and call 'd a Watchman directly ; he was then , I think , crying past a 11 , and going up a Court about a 100 Yards from where I met the Prisoners ; I told him they were both standing together ; but when we came back , one was on one side of the Way , and the other on t'other ; Mr. Mand 's House is opposite to the New-Exchange . Court . Were the Prisoners running when you came to take them ? Watchman . No , nor they did not offer to run . Edward Wilson . I have known the Prosecutor ever since he was 9 Years old , he bears the Character of an honest , just Man ; tho ' I have heard that he has been represented to the Court as a Lunatic . Court . The Court has heard nothing of it . Edward Wilson . We had a Cause depending in our Society , and we chose him , as an Apothecary to decide betwixt a Widow and the Club ; and if he had not bore a good Character , we should not have chosen him for such a Definition . A Juryman . You say , you have known him from 9 Years old , How old do you take him to be now ? I have a particular Reason for asking . Wilson . I take him to be about 30 or 31 , he 's hardly more if so much ; for when I first knew him , I and his Father belong 'd to a Club , at Mr. Doby 's , who kept the Fountain , and that 's about 22 Years ago . Juryman . I ask , because it is not above a Year and a Half ago when he voluntarily came to me to be Security for a Man , and gave his Note accordingly , but when the Note become due he pleaded Non-age . G. Young . I own it , and I am now but 22 Years old ; my Brother indeed is about 30 , and it must be him that Mr. Wilson means . John Luckil , Constable . The Prosecutor brought the Prisoners to the Watch-house , and charged me with them ; and then he wanted to go home , but I told him ; he must stay and make his Charge good before the Justice ; says he , rather than stay all Night , I 'll discharge 'em . I told him , that could not be done , but if he 'd send for some Body to satisfy me that he was a House-keeper , I would not detain him . He accordingly sent for a Neighbour , and I let him go home . Prisoner Headly . We insisted that he should be kept all Night to make good him Charge . Constable . Yes , they did , and therefore I insisted that he should send for some Body that knew him . William Hains . I am Coachman to the Princess Royal . I have known Headly 7 Years ; he has work 'd in the Stables 3 Years , and behaved himself very well . Jonathan Hurly , I am Coachman to the Young Princesses . I have known Headly 7 or 8 Years ; he was 3 Years in the Stables . When we attended Princess Amelia to the Bath , he went with us , and was trusted in the Scullery . Then he went with us to Tunbridge , and after the Journeys were over he was discharged ; he always behaved himself well , and I take him to be as honest a Lad as any upon Earth . He has been gone from us about 4 Years ; he has lived in another Place since he left us , but for this 2 or 3 Years , he has been out of Service , and got his living by running of Errands , and cleaning of Shoes . Owen Thomas . I have known both the Prisoners 7 Years , Chapman has cleaned my Shoes 3 Years , and Headly went with us to Bath and Tunbridge , and I never heard any harm of either of them . John North . I have known 'em both 3 Years ; I have trusted Chapman with things of value , and never had any Suspicion of them . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 43. John Griffin , of Clerkenwell , was indicted for the Murder of Sarah Stevens , an Infant aged 20 Months , by driving 3 Horses drawing a Cart , the Off-Wheel of which run over the Child 's Head , and broke the Skull , of which Fracture she instantly dy 'd , August 10 . Acquitted . 44. Thomas Rice , of St. Magnes the Martyr , was indicted for the Murder of Eliz .

He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for Manslaughter . Acquitted . 45.

See summary . ] 48 Richard Sanders , of St. Dunstan 's in the West , was indicted for stealing a pair of Shoes , value 1 s. a pair of Stockings , value 1 s. and a Wig , value 10s . the Goods of Nicholas Harding , Esq ; Sept. 15 . Mr. Harding . Before I had taken up the Prisoner 's Wife ( who was try 'd just now ) I was told that he and she lay together in my Chambers during my Absence . I challenged her then with some Things that were missing , she said , that he had taken them away . She gave me the Key of his Room , in Black-Friars , I went thither with my Servant and a Constable . The Prisoner was in Bed ; I found a pair of Shoes , a pair of black worsted Stockings , and a Wig there , which were mine . He got up and put them on , and said , his Wife brought them . I told him , I had lost several other Things , and that his Wife had sent me to him . Says he , what Things are they , set them down upon a piece of Paper , and I 'll go with you to all the Pawnbrokers that she deals with in Shoe-Lane , and if we ca n't find them , I 'll pay you for them , or make you any other Satisfaction . I told him , that I understood he lay at my Chambers in my Absence , and he owned that he had . Prisoner . Yes , in the Footman 's Bed , my Wife told me you desir 'd her to lie there , and she desir 'd me to lie with her . She told me too , that you would take it well if I sorted some Votes and Pamphlets which lay in your Chambers , and I did so . I believe the Shoes and Stockings she gave me were yours ; but she said , you had given her leave to take them . As for the Wig , she said , it was given her by her Master Thickness , who lived with you . And upon her owning before Sir William Billers that she gave me these Things , I was discharged ; but you took me up a 2d Time about sorting your Papers . Mr. Harding . I was informed by a Porter , that he had seen the Prisoner come out of my Chambers with a Bundle of Papers , ty 'd with a Red Tape . I found such Papers in the Prisoner 's Room , and says he , These are the Papers that the Porter saw me with , I had them from my Brother . I look 'd over them , and found some Gilt-paper , that I had had by me for 2 or 3 Years . Edmund Weller . I know the Wig to be my Master 's , and not Mr. Thickness 's , for Mr. Thickness did not live with my Master after I came . Prisoner . Did not you swear before Sir William , that you had heard your Master say , that Mr. Thickness had wore that Wig ? Weller . I do n't remember that I did , but your Wife said , that you took the Wig out of the Box your self my Master tax 'd you with taking a black Coat , and you own 'd that you had pawn 'd it to redeem another Coat that you had pawn 'd before . Prisoner . I have been committed to Prison a great many Times , for assaulting my Wife ; She swore the Peace against me , so after that I was seldom out of Jail long together . And the last Time I could not be discharged without coming to some Agreement with her . So she said , that she had got a good Place at Mr. Harding 's , that she had 30 l. a Year stacking Wager , and 30 l. a Year vails , besides all his old Cloaths , and if I would come and live with her again ( for we had not liv 'd together as Man and Wife for above 5 Years ) she would give the Cloaths to me , and so she did , as I shall prove . Hannah Foreman . The Prisoner was committed for beating his Wife , and after he was discharged , she said , if he 'd live with her , she had Cloaths enough to give him , and that she had 2l . a Year Salary from Mr. Harding . Elizabeth Martin . I was with the Prisoner 's Wife , when she brought him drest from Bridewell to her Lodgings . Court . What Stockings had he on ? Martin . Black Silk Stockings ; and See , says she , what a fine Figure I have made of him . If he 'll come and live with me , I 'll find him in Cloaths ; but if he wo n't , I 'll throw him in Jail , and there he shall lie to Eternity . Sampson Puller . I heard his Wife say , that the Cloaths were hers , and that they were given to her by Mr. Thickness . Agnes Foster . I heard her say , that she gave him the Cloaths , and that by God , she would sell her Soul to the Devil , but she 'd have her revenge of him . Jane Inwood . And I heard her swear , God damn her Soul and Body , if she was not reveng 'd on him . I went with her to setch him out of Bridewell , and she gave him a pair of Shoes and Stockings , and he put them on there , and she told him , if he would go home with her , she had other Things to give him . Court . Of what Colour were the Stockings ? Foster . They were Grey Worsted . Court . Elizabeth Martin swore they were Black Silk . Elizabeth Croshaw . The Prisoner lodg 'd in my House 5 Months ; and he was carry 'd from thence to New-Prison 2 or 3 times for beating his Wife ; he 's a very honest Man . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 49. Peter Tremain , was indicted for unlawfully offering and paying to Mary Neal , a counterfeit Piece of Money , in likeness of a Shilling , as a good Shilling , he knowing it to be Counterfeit . Mary Neal . The Prisoner and his Wife came to my Stall in Bartholomew-Fair , about Dusk , and asked me , if I could change half a Crown if they bought something ? Yes , says I , What will you have ? A Penny Trumpet , says he . They were mighty difficult in chusing , but at last they fixt upon one , and then she bid me give her change for half a Crown . I ask 'd for the half Crown ; N o , says she , I never part with my Money in a Fair , till I have my Change . My Husband was just gone for a Penny-worth of Cheese , and I not having Silver enough about me , I gave her a Shilling in part , and told her my Husband would be back in 2 or 3 Minutes , and give her the rest . Come , says the Prisoner to his Wife , we ca n't stay , give the Woman her Shilling again , I believe I have got Halfpence ; says she , I gave the Shilling to you ; No , says he , you did not ; but I did , says she , look in your Pocket , and you 'll find it . So he took out some Silver in his Hand , and about 3 Pennyworth of Half pence , and gave this Shilling and a Penny to her , and she gave the same to me , and they went away ; I put the Penny in my Pocket , and keeping the Shilling in my Hand , I felt it crack as I held it . I subscrib 'd the Prisoner and his Wife to some People , who follow 'd and took them presently . The Prisoner offer 'd me a Guinea and a Crown bowl of Punch to smother it up , and not appear against them . And his Wife confess 'd before the Justice , that she knew it was a bad Shilling . Prisoner . My Wife took the Shilling for a good one . Court . That will not excuse your putting it off if you knew it was bad . Whether you took it for a good one or not , the Law is the same . If you found it bad , you ought to have destroy 'd it immediately . The Jury found him Guilty . 50. Mary Tremain , was indicted for the same Offence , and the Evidence against her being the same , the Jury found her Guilty . [ Peter Tremain , Mary Tremain : Imprisonment .
