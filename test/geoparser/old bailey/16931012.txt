They produced the Secretary 's Warrant in Court , which was read on their behalf ; but were told by the Court that their Warrant was to impower them to seize the persons , not the goods ; and the Warrant was directed to a Messenger , and not to them ; and what had they to do to meddle with the Goods ?

The Prisoners alledged that they charged the said Atkinson with Treason , for Clipping money ; but then comes Mrs. Arnold , and declares , That they used her in a very uncivil manner , and gave abundance of ill names , and searcht her House , but found nothing ; and being with her in the Street , pretending to go before a Justice , the Prisoners and one Ireland gave them the slip ; and afterwards they had a Treat , and drank the two Fish-womens health , saying they had had a good Booty on the over-night ; afterwards Mr. Cook was found out in Fetter-Lane , and part of the money was about him , which he did not deny to be Arnold 's money ; Mr. Cook called several Witnesses who were with him when he searcht the House , who declared that he fairly searcht her House , but found nothing suspicious there ; he pleaded his Deputation , ( and what he did was by virtue of the power derived from it ) which he had from the Warden of the Mint ; that was true , but then he must take heed how he executes that power , it must be upon persons of those suspected , and not upon their Goods ; for this was of such bad Example , that all honest persons might be seized in the Street .
