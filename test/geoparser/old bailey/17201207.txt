That the next Day the 26th in the Morning he heard several abusive Words pass between them upon the Quarter Deck , and the Deceased ordered the Prisoner to go off , which he did , and in about a Quarter of an Hour after came up again , pull 'd off his Hat , and told the Deceased that he had leave from Capt . Boyle ( the Commander of the said Ship ) to walk the Quarter Deck when he pleased , to which the Deceased reply 'd be might walk and be damn 'd . That the same Day before Noon the Deceased told him ( this Evidence ) that the Captain had given him leave for the Boat to go on Shore when he would , to do himself Justice ; that he ( this Evidence ) told him it were best let alone ; but if he must do it , he had better defer it till he come to England , for it might be of very ill conse quence to him there ; that he made light of his Advice , , and went out of his Cabbin . That in the Evening the Prisoner came upon the Deck , and told one of his ( this Evidence 's ) Mates , that he had got the Captain 's leave for a Boat to carry him a Shore the next Morning . That the next Morning ( being Sunday the 27th ) the Prisoner came into his Cabbin before he was up , and ask 'd him for a Dram ; that when he ( this Evidence ) arose , he heard that the Prisoner and the Deceased were gon-a-Shore ; and in a Quarter of an Hour the Boat came aboard with the Corps of the Deceased with several Wounds some clear through . Then this Evidence being ask 'd some Questions by the Prisoner , farther deposed that the Deceased and the Prisoner till this time were very great Friends , and that the Prisoner had lent the Deceased both Money and Necessaties several times ; that the Deceased was apt to give Foul Words , and be Quarrelsome , and that this Evidence had parted with him on Account of the ill Language be had received from him That the Prisoner behaved himself all along very Civilly , and was not at all given to Quarrel . William Cannon , ( Surgeon of the said Ship the Worcester ) deposed that the Prisoner was his first Mate , and that he being in the Master 's Cabbin the 25th of September 1719 heard the prisoner ask the Deceased to sign the Papers who told him he would not sign it then ; there were Times and Seasons ; upon which the Prisoner told him be would not be made a Property ; that he should sign it , and pay him what he owed him before he went out of the Ship ; upon which the Deseased said , he would pay him the Money as soon as he had it , but would not sign the Paper at all , being not to be huss 'd into it . That a little while after , as he was walking on the Quarter Deck ( where the Deceased also came and walked ) he saw the Deceased 's Servant and the Prisoner getting the Prisoner 's things out of the Deceased 's Cabbin ; after they had taken four or five turns , the Prisoner came up , and he and the Deceased began to reproach each other with normal Obligations , and amongst others , the Deceased told the Prisoner , that he had been greatly favour 'd in being admitted to walk the Quarter Deck . To which the Prisoner reply 'd that he had been admitted to the Society of Lieutenants aboard other Ships as well as this and received as many Favours from them , and said to him , you are my officer here , and insist upon Privileges but what are we when we are ashore ? to which the Deceased answered , I am Charles Bignell and you are Edward Ely . Upon which the Prisoner said be believed him to be like an Old Woman , and could do nothing but Scold . That he ( this Evidence ) went after wards to the Deceased to endeavour to mitigate the Matter , advising him to sign the Paper , telling him that he believed that the Prisoner was in Drink , or else he would not have used him so . To which the Deceased reply 'd Drink is no Excuse for Rudeness ; he sha n't lye in my Cabbin any longer nor will I forgive him ; for he has as good as challenged me ; nor will I sign the Paper ; for I am not to be huss 'd into Compliance . That the next Morning about 10 or 11 a Clock he found the Deceased walking on one side of the Quarter Deck , and the Prisoner on the other side ; that he asked the Prisoner where he had lain the last Night , who answered , that he had lain with Mr Weston ( the Second Lieutenant ) in his Bed , who gave him a Can of Elip before they went to Bed ; and then told him that the Deceased had ordered him off the Quarter Deck , but Capt.Boyle had ordered him on again ; and told him , that if he had a mind to do himself Justice , he should do it ; thereby making an Uriah of him . That presently after the Deceased came to him and told him that the Prisoner had Challenged him before the whole Quarter Deck , and had told him that if he did not do him Justice he would post him for a Coward ; that he ( this Evidence ) told the Deceased he was sorry for it , and again begg 'd of him to sign the Paper to put an end to the Difference . That about 2 or 3 a Clock the Prisoner came to him on the Quarter Deck and made a Protection that he would do himself Justice let the Consequence be what it would . That he told him to Morrow was Sunday , and he hoped he would not do it then ; upon which the Prisoner asked him if he thought he was Child ? and said , to morrow is my Birth-Day , on which I am 30 years of Age ; and perhaps it may be the Day of my Death ; I have but one Life so left . Upon which he told him , that if he could prevail with the Deceased to sign the Paper he hoped that would put an end to the matter ; to which the Prisoners reply 'd perhaps it may , and perhaps it may not ; as he will . That afterwards , he ( this Evidence ) went into the Master 's Cabbin to consult with him how to prevent the Mischief that might arise from the aforementioned Dispute , and then went again to the Deceased to persuade him to sign the Paper and prevent the mischief which might otherwise ensue ; but the Deceased told him that he spent his Breach in vain , for it was not consistent with his Honour to sign it , because it would be to sign himself a Coward ; and he was not to be huss 'd and bully 'd into a Compliance ; that the Deceased said his Principles were as honest as any man 's , and that he did not intend to Wrong the Prisoner nor any Man ; but to pay him as soon as he was able ; and that he meant to have sign 'd the Paper if the Prisoner had not used him in such a manner ; but now he would never forgive him nor Drink with him , nor sit where he was . That the next Morning he was call 'd up about 6 o , Clock and found the Deceased dead on the Quarter Deck . That he had 8 Wounds , one whereof was over the Left Pap , through the Left Lobe of the Lungs , coming out under the Armpit , which he judged to be the Cause of his Death .

Clarke . And that the Prisoner was Well-behaved , and never given to Quarrel . Daniel Clarke ( Midshipman ) deposed , that he heard the Deceased ask the Prisoner what was the matter that he was so hasty for his signing the Paper , and told him that he did not deny signing it , but another time might do as well ; to which the Prisoner reply 'd he would not be made a Property of : And then one of them Challenged the other ; but he could not tell which , and the Deceased said the Boat is now boisting out , and he would go ashore with him directly ; to which the Prisoner reply 'd , No you are my Officer now , but if you do n't see me , I 'll post you , for you will talk and Chatter , and that 's all you can do . That soon after the Deceased bid the Prisoner go look after the Sick Men ; to which he reply 'd you are not my Captain now , for Capt . Boyle 's come aboard again . That the Prisoner in the Evening ask 'd Mr. Young ( the Master 's first Mate ) whether he had the Morning Watch , who told him No ; then the Prisoner said if he had , the Captain had given him leave for the Boat in the Morning .
