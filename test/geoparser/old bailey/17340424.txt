John Wingfield . The Prisoner came to my Shop , with a Pattern of printed Linnen , and said , If I could match it , he should buy a Parcel of me , I happened to have none of the same Sort in my Shop , and so he left it with me , and came again in 2 or 3 days . I told him , I had been at several Places to match it , but could not do it exactly . Well , , says he , It do n't signifie much , and as I have given you some trouble , I intend to take a Parcel of you , for I have got a Sister at Twickenham , who keeps a Worsted Shop next to the Kings Arms there ; and as she has a large Acquaintance , she is willing to sell Linnen . I desired him to look out what he thought proper . But , he said , he would come another time , and do that , because his Sister 's Waterman , who had brought up Money to pay for a Parcel of Linnen , was gone back to Twickenham , but would be here again in a Day or two . The Prisoner came accordingly , and said the Waterman had brought the Money . So he look 'd out a Parcel of Goods , and made me cut a Piece of Muslin , because , he said , the whole would come to more Money than his Sister had sent . When he had chosen the Goods , and we had agreed upon the Price , I made out a Bill of Parcels for Goods sold Mrs Wilson , ( for that he said was his Sister 's Name ) and sent them by my Servant , with Orders not to deliver them without the Money . My Servant returned , and told me that the Prisoner had run away with the Goods . This was on the 21st of March ; and on Saturday the 30th of the same Month , as I was going along White-chappel with Mr. Dun , I accidentally saw the Prisoner . Says I to Mr. Dun , I believe that 's the Man that took me in . Mr. Dun mending his Pace , the Prisoner took to his Heels , and happen 'd to run down a Stable-yard that was no Thorow-Fare . We follow 'd , and at last found him hid under a Manger . We carried him before a Justice ; but he was so sullen , that he wou 'd not tell his Name , where he lived , or who he was acquainted with . I had seen a Description of such a Chap , ( in the Daily Advertiser of the 4 or 5 of March ) who had cheated other Persons of a large Quantity of Linnen ; and thereupon I sent to those Persons , who came and found the Prisoner to be the Man . We found a pocket-Book upon him , in which there was an Account of many dark Things he had been concern 'd in . Mansel Alcock , the Prosecutor 's Servant . By my Master 's Order I took the Goods , and went with the Prisoner to the Blue-Anchor Alehouse in Swan-Lane . He asked if his Waterman was there , and somebody said , No . Then he called for a Pint of Beer , and when it was empty 'd he said , Come , we 'll go see for him at another House , and you may leave the Goods here . Prisoner . Did not you deliver the Goods to me ? Alcock . No ; I left them in the open Room , and then we went to an Alehouse . And the Prisoner pretending to speak for some Beer , stept out at the back Door . As soon as I found he was gone , I ran back to the Blue-Anchor to see for the Goods . But Mrs Spinks , the Woman of the House , told me , that the Prisoner had fetch 'd them away . Mrs Spinks . I keep the Blue-Anchor . Court . Have you a Husband ? Mrs Spinks . Yes . Court . What is his Name ? Mrs Spinks . Joseph Spinks - This Lad bid the Prisoner come to my House . The Lad brought a Bundle , and the Prisoner asked me , if the Twickenham Waterman was there ? I said , No . Then he asked the Lad if he 'd drink a Dram or a pint of Beer - They had a pint of Beer ; and then the Lad left the Bundle , and they went away together . But the Prisoner soon returned alone , and said , he had found the Waterman ; and so he took the Bundle and went away , towards the Monument . Edward Dun . On Saturday the 21 of March , as the Prosecutor and I were going along White-chappel , we saw the Prisoner crossing the way . Says the Prosecutor , I believe that 's the Man as took me in . Why do n't you follow him then ? Says I ; and upon that the Fellow began to run , and we ran after him . I suppose he intended to make the best of his way to Goodman's-Fields : But turning down an Alley that was no Thorow-Fare , he hid himself in a Stable , where we found him . Prisoner . They cry 'd , Stop Thief ! And that made me run . Court . But was that a Reason for your Running , if you had not been a Thief ? Mr. Dun . We did not cry , Stop Thief ! Prisoner . I bought the Goods of the Prosecutor . He sent them by his Man to the Place appointed , and the Man deliver 'd them into my Hands . Court . The young Man denies that upon his Oath . Prosecutor . He said they were not for himself , but his Sister Wilson at Twickenham ; but upon Enquiry we could find no such Person . Court . His taking the Goods out of the House , fixes the Fact upon him . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . He was a second time indicted for a Misdemeanor , in defrauding Peter Webb , and Edward Ayre , of a parcel of Linnen , value 21 l. under pretence of being a Shop-keeper at Brentford ; and that if they sent the Goods by a Servant , he wou 'd pay the Money upon the Delivery . But the Prisoner being Capitally convicted on the former indictment , he was not try 'd on this . 7. Elizabeth Matkins , was indicted for stealing a Gold Medal , value 16 s. the Property of William King , March 3 . William King . I drank 2 or 3 Bottles of Wine with the Prisoner , at the Key and Garter in Drury-lane . When the Reckoning came to be paid , I pulled out some Money and this Medal among it . She asked me to let her look on it , and so She took it out of my Hand ; and put it into her Mouth ; and then told me she had swallow 'd it . Mrs Jones the Landlady , let her out at the back Door . I desir 'd Mrs Jones to call the Watch ; but She bid me do it my self . I ran out and catch 'd the Prisoner ; and getting Assistance , carried her to St. Martin 's Round-house , Mrs Jones came , and said , if I 'd take her Word , the Prisoner should be forthcoming on the Morrow , and I shou 'd have the Medal in 3 Days , if I would give the Prisoner the Value of it in Silver . Prisoner . Was not you with other Whores in Windsor-Court , where you drank 5 or 6 Quarterns of Brandy with them , and then they beat you ? Prosecutor . Yes , I had been up the Court with another Woman , but she wrong 'd me of nothing . Prisoner . But was not you a fighting with them ? and did not I come and take your part , when they were a beating of you ? Prosecutor . There was a little of a Debate - but no Fighting as I remember . Prisoner . You was drunk , and do n't know what there was - I am sure you begg 'd of me to see you safe out of the Court , for you was afraid they 'd quite demolish you ; and when we came into the Lane , you invited me to drink a Glass of Wine for my Civility . Stephen Ewen . The Constable being busy , desired me to go with the Prisoner to the Round-house , And as I was going with her in a Coach , she pull 'd out some Silver , and a Piece of Gold a little bigger than a Half-Guinea , and said she had it of the Gentleman , but he should never have it again . Prisoner . Did I say , I robb 'd him of it ? Ewen . I do n't say you did . Prisoner . Did not I say he gave it me ? Ewen . I believe you might William Scot , Constable . In the Round-house the Prisoner said , She had swallow 'd the Medal ; but if the Man would give her the Value of it , he should have it again ; and she said he gave it her . Prisoner . And so he did about 2 in the Morning . And the Woman of the House knows it ; for she was in the Room all the while - but she is not here , because they want to prosecute her for keeping a Baudy-house . Prosecutor . Why did you run away , if I gave it you ? Prisoner . I did not run . Prosecutor . You are a saucy lying B - The Jury found her Guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 8. Ann Day , was indicted for stealing a brocaded silk Gown and Peticoat , value 5 l. a Dimity-Gown , a quilted Peticoat , 3 under Peticoats , 5 Smocks , 4 Tea Spoons , a Pair of Tea Tongs , a Silver handed Knife and Fork , a Girdle-Buckle , a Silver Snuff-box , 5 pair of silk Stockings , and a Mob , the Goods of Mary Morris , in her House , Decemb . 30 . Mary Fortune . My name was Morris when I was robb 'd , but I have since been married . The Prisoner was my Servant , and had lived with me three Quarters of a Year - She asked me to go out to see her Child , and she staid out several Nights , which made me mistrust her ; and when she came again , I examin 'd my Trunk , and mist the Goods . She confest she had pawn 'd them at Joe Euthard 's , in Villars-street . He refused to let me have them , without laying down the Money they were pawn 'd for , which was 6 Guineas ; and so my Husband got a Search Warrant . Humphry Fortune . Missing the Goods , I tax 'd the Prisoner . She fell on her Knees and begg 'd Pardon , and said , she 'd make me amends , for she had some Goods of her own , and would sell them and redeem mine , which she said she had pawn 'd at Jo . Euthard 's , at the 3 Bowls in Villars-street . He would not produce them till I got a Search-Warrant and he was very unwilling then ; for he brought them before the Justice at 4 or 5 times . Joseph Uthard . The Prisoner pawn 'd the Goods with me at several times , in October , November , and December . She came in her Mistresses Name , and I knew her Mistress used to send to her , and a former Maid , to pledge things at my House ; and sometimes she came her self , and she own 'd that she sent the plate by the Prisoner - I shew 'd them the Goods when they demanded it . Prisoner . My Mistress sent me to pawn some of the Things , and the rest I pawn 'd for my own Use - They put me in here last Sessions , but fetch 'd me out themselves , because the Goods were laid in a wrong Name . Mrs Fortune . I did send her with 5 Spoons , and that was all , and I sent her again with Money to redeem them . Court . When were you married ? Fortune . The 3 of January last Uthard . They did not come for the Goods till the 15 of January . The Jury found her Guilty to the value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9. Edward Lampern , was indicted for stealing 2 Cocks and 4 Hens , the Property of Robert Cary Esq ; Feb. 25 . He was a second time indicted for stealing a Coat and a pair of Boots , the Goods of Robert Cary Esq ; and a Waistcoat , the Property of Benjamin Pritchard , in the Stables of Robert Cary Esq ; He was a third time indicted for stealing a Waistcoat and a Wig , the Goods of , March 3 . Guilty of the first and second , to the value of 10 d. each , and Acquitted of the third . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 10. Sarah Delany , was indicted for stealing a silver Mug , value 50 s. the Property of James Martland , in his Shop , March 4 . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 11. Percival Lowther , was indicted for privately stealing a Gold Watch chaced , value 20 l. from the Person of Jane Hunter , March 30 . Jane Hunter . On the 30 of March , in the Afternoon , I met Captain Mitchell in Long-Acre . How 'ye do , Madam ? Says he . Very well , thank you , Captain , says I . And how does Mr. such-a-one do ? says he ; Very well , Sir , says I again , and then I look 'd upon my Watch , and it was just upon the Stroke of two , and so the Captain and I parted . The Minute he left me , I met the Prisoner ; he got betwixt me and the Wall , put his Arms round my Waist , asked me a rude Question and thrust me up against the Post . I was very much frighted ; but as soon as I recovered myself , I said , O my Watch is gone - Then , Madam , says he , you ca n't tell what 's a Clock . So he walked along towards Drury-lane , and stopt to speak with an Ordinary Creachure that stood at the End of Princes Court . Court . Were you acquainted with him ? Hunter . No , I never saw the Fellow before . Court . It 's very strange , that a Man should be guilty of such an Action in a publick Street , and in the middle of the Day , and yet not endeavour to escape . Hunter . But it 's very true ; and last Friday Morning , a Watch-maker came to wind up a Clock in the House where I live , and he told me that he had seen such a Watch as mine , and had it in his Hand , and that one Lowther ( not the Prisoner , but another of the same Name ) brought it to him - it was a Gold chaced Watch . I value it at 14 l. Ann Cole I saw Mrs Hunter in Long-Acre , and a Man had his Arms round Waist She flung from him , and call 'd him Fellow and said , she had lost her Watch . Then she went to Princes Court , and he to Red-Lion-Court End , on the other side of the Way . She turned back in a great flurry and went in at a Door . I thought it a very odd Matter , and so I look 'd after him and he crost the Way , and stood talking , with a fat Woman in a striped Gown , at the End of Princes-Court Ann Murphey . There was a Mob about my Door , and this Gentlewoman and that Man were among them She held her Watch-chain in her Hand , and said , she had lost her Watch ; and he said in a Bantering-way , Why do n't you search me ? You see I do n't run away . Captain Mitchell . I know nothing of the Prisoner or the Fact , but I met this Gentlewoman in Long Acre , and as I had a small Acquaintance with her , in good manners I asked her how she did , and how a certain Gentlewoman of her Acquaintance did . I remember she look 'd upon her Watch , and I saw the Pointer was toward two . Whether it was a Gold Watch or no , I ca n't swear ; but it was like one , in Shape and Colour . James Birdsell . Last Thursday Morning , a Gold Watch was brought to me to be set faster . Mrs. Hunter had describ 'd her Watch to me , and this answer 'd the Description ; but as it was not advertised , I would not venture to stop it . So going to her Lodgings to wind up a Clock , I told her of it . It was brought to me by one Lowther a Seal Graver in Fountain-Court in the Strand . I had but a short Acquaintance with him . I asked him how long he had had it ? He said , sometime I asked what he would have for it ? He said 14 Guineas , and he would spend half a Guinea of the Money . I bid him leave it , and may be I might help him to a Chap , tho ' I intended to shew it to Madam ; but he would not I went with her to his House , but he was not at home . Court . Why was not Lowther brought hither ? Birdsell . I know nothing of that . Prisoner . As I was standing by the End of Long-Acre , this Woman went by on the other side of the Way , and said she had lost her Watch : She had a Train of People after her . Hunter . There was not a Creachure near me , when he stopt me . Prisoner . The People said , they did not believe her , for she was a Town-Madam of a very indifferent Character . And so when she came down again , I had the misfortune to ask her if she had pawn 'd her Watch ? Damn you , says she , I do n't know but you have got it - she went after some Captain , as she call 'd him , unto Long-Acre ; but when she had gone a little way , she came back once more , and I offer 'd to be searched ; but she got a Constable who carried me before the Justice . Joseph Andrews . The Prisoner came to live with my Lord Harbrough as his Porter , in March , 1731 . His Lordship dyed on the 16th of October following ; but the Prisoner staid in the House till the next January . He bore a good Character . The Jury acquitted him . 12. Ann Bushel , was indicted for stealing 8 yards of Shagreen , a yard of Musling , and other things , the Goods of Ann Smith , Jan. 7 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 13 Sarah Smith , was indicted for stealing a Gown and Petticoat the Goods of Ann Rudyard , and a Petticoat , 3 Smocks , 3 Frocks , the Goods of Wheeler Hardesty , April . 13 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 14. Daniel Cook , was indicted for stealing 2 Gold Plates , and a Gold Rim of a Snuffbox , val . 10 l. the Goods of the Rt . Honourable the Lord Harvey ; and a Gold Tweezer Case val . 4 l. the Goods of Peter Dutems , in the House of Elisha Manisire , Jan. 25 . The Prisoner was tryed last Sessions , for stealing these Goods ; but they being ( by mistake ) laid in the Indictment to be the Goods of Elisha Manisire , he was acquitted ; but this other Bill being found against him , he was detain 'd in Custody till this Sessions . Elisha Manisire . I am an Engraver . Two Gold Plates , and a Gold Rim of a Snuff-box belonging to my L Harvey , and a Gold Tweezer Case of Mr Dutems were delivered to me to do some work to them . They were lost out of my Drawers on the 25th of January , and not hearing of them in three Days , I advertised them the Monday following , with a Reward of 10 Guineas , to the Person who brought them to Mr. Dutems , at the Golden Cup in Leicester-Square . And the same Night the Prisoner , ( who is my Apprentice ) and Peter Hales , Mr. Dutems 's Apprentice , came to me at a House where I was , and told me with a great deal of Joy , that they had heard news of the Box , and then they shew 'd me a Letter . Prisoner . was it I , or Peter Hales , who gave you the Letter . R. M. I ca n't be certain which , - But here is the Letter . Mr. Dutems . I receiv 'd this Letter by the Penny Post , and sent it by my Apprentice to Mr. Manisire . Court . Let the Letter be read . Clerk reads . ` To Mr. Dutems at the Golden Cup , in ` Leicester-Square . Send the Boy or Girl , of ` the Person from whom the Things were took , ` with the Money this Night ' . [ the Letter is torn in this place , and here 's something wanting ] ` Shoulder of Mutton fields , let them ` be there by Eleven . Send nobody with them . ` Let them be in a Red Coat or Gown . ` P. S. None but them will have it , and ` they must bring this Letter , I shall drop it ` first and so let them the Money . At 11 a Clock I and the Prisoner , with some of my Friends , went to the Shoulder of Mutton-fields : but not caring to venture the 10 Guineas , before I saw some probability of getting the Goods , we waited at some distance , and sent the Prisoner without the Money , to see if the Man was there , and brought the Goods . He went , and return 'd in a little time , and said to us ; I have met the Man , and he ask 'd me if I had brought the Money . I told him no , for my Master was afraid he had not got the Things . He told me that he had , and put the Top of the Tweezer Case in my Hand , and jingled the other things in his Pocket ; and then he bid me come to morrow Night at the same Hour , and bring the Money , but let nobody come with me . So we returned home , and went again the next Night : but having some suspicion of the Prisoner , I sent two of my Friends , a little before , ( without the Prisoner 's knowledge ) to watch if any body came to him . But neither of them are here . For one of them ca n't speak English , and the other ( Mr. Costeau ) is now a Prisoner in the Fleet . We took Arms with us ; but when we came to the Field , the Prisoner pretended to be afraid , and desir 'd to have a Brace of Pistols . I let him have one , and bid him fire it off if the Man went to take the Money from him without delivering the Goods . So giving him the 10 Guineas , he went towards the appointed part of the Field , and we lay perdue . In a quarter of an Hour we heard the Pistol fir 'd ; upon which we ran towards the Place , and saw the Prisoner struggling with a Man . I took that Man to be the Thief , and was going to shoot him , but was afraid of killing the Prisoner . But when I came quite up to them , I found that Man was my Friend Costeau . We searched the Prisoner , and found a Guinea in his Pocket , he said the Man gave it him in goodwill . I ask 'd him why he fir 'd then ? and he answer 'd , because he saw 2 Men coming along . I ask 'd him what he had done with the other 9 ? He said he had given them to the Man for the Goods . Mr. Costeau said , that no Man came to the Prisoner . Court . You should have brought Mr Costeau hither by a Habea Crpus . E. M. I have been at a considerable Charge already about this Affair - we went to the Salmon and Ball , and I told the Prisoner I suspected he had hid the Money in the Bank . He said , Do you think I would serve you so ? But three of the Company took Links , and went back to see if they could find it . While they were gone the Prisoner call 'd me aside , and said it was Necessity that drove him to do what he had done , and beg 'd that I would not prosecute him ; for if I did , he was ruined . I told him , his best way would be , to make a plain Confession ; and then he own 'd he had hid 9 Guineas in the Bank . Upon this we went out , and met the three Men coming back with their Links . The Prisoner desir 'd the Links might be put out , or keep at a distance , and so he went to the Place in the Dark , and went into the Ditch , and brought out the Money . Prisoner . Did not I describe the Man to be in a Lac 'd hat and a Great-coat . E. M. Yes ; the first Night . P. And the second Night , I told you which way he went , and that he was not gone 20 Yards off when you came up to me . Mr. Dutems . I am a Jeweller , and Goldsmith . My Lord Harvey gave me a Family-Box to fit up . Mr. Manisire had it from me , and after sometime , he told me , it was lost . We advertised it ; and the same Evening I received the Letter that was produced in Court . I sent my Servant with it to Mr. Manisire : But his Servant ( the Prisoner ) came , and told me his Master was not at home . I sent them both back to look for him , and at last they found him . We thought it was not safe to send the Prisoner alone with 10 Guineas , for fear Somebody , who might have seen the Advertisement , might wait at the Place , and Rob him - I never mistrusted the Prisoner , because he always behaved well . Isaac Dubois . I went with the Rest to the Field . When we came near the Place , we sent the Boy ( the Prisoner ) before , and then we laid down on the Grass - It was about the middle of the Field . He went about half a Field 's length , and returned in 6 or 7 Minutes . When he came to where we lay , he started , and said , O is it you ? I have met my Chap ; he was very civil , and said , young Man be civil to me , and I 'll be civil to you It was not a foggy Night ; for as we lay down , we could see the Hedges at a reasonable Distance : But we saw Nobody but the Prisoner . - The next Night , Mr Costeau and another Frenchman went beforehand to hide themselves in a Ditch , and we follow 'd - We came to an Alehouse , and mark 'd some of the Guineas unknown to the Prisoner , and then wrapt them in a Paper , and put them into his Stock , and so set forward . He told us we might go 2 or 3 Fields farther , till we came to the Bridge . I had one pair of Pistols , and his Master had another . I lent the Prisoner one of mine , and he went towards the Place , which was about 60 Yards off . He fired his Pistol , and we ran up . At first we scarce knew Friends from Foes . Mr. Costeau had got hold of the Prisoner , and said , Aye , you are the Thief . Says the Prisoner , I have got the Things , and the Man is gone over the Bar-gate that way . I follow 'd , but it was Knee deep , and I could go no farther ; and so we return 'd to the Salmon and Ball . I was one of the 3 who first went back from thence , to look for the Money . And as we returned , the second Time towards the Alehouse , we met the Prisoner and the rest of our Company . Somebody said , the Prisoner had confest , and was going to fetch the Money ; but he would have the Links put out , and so they were . Then he would do nothing before me and Mr. Costeau ; upon which we staid at a little Distance , and the Prisoner went into the Ditch , where he hid himself . His Master call 'd to us , Hist ! Hist , we came forward , and he said , he believ 'd he was gone . We call 'd the Prisoner , but he would not answer ; but at last his Master tumbled over him . Then the Prisoner said , he must have a Link , and I went back to the Ale-house and brought one . At my Return , Mr. Manisire shew 'd me the Money , and I knew it to be the same by the Marks . Peter Hiles . At 9 at Night , my Master told me he had received a Letter , and sent me with it to the Prisoner 's Master ; but he was not at home . I told the Prisoner , the Thief was found , and he must meet him in the Shoulder of Mutton-Fields . He said , he would not venture his Life for his Master , nor never a Man in the World - At last he found his Master - I went with them that Night to the Salmon and Ball , and thence over 3 or 4 Fields ; the Prisoner went before , and we lay down in the middle of the Field . He soon returned , and said it was no Bite , for he had met his Chap , who had shewn him the Top of the Tweezer-case , and chinked the rest of the Things in his Pocket . When I first came to the Place , says he , I walk 'd about , and the Man came out of the Ditch , and walked about too ; and then he said , young Man do me no Harm , and I 'll do you none . Next Night we went again , and the Prisoner went a Field or 2 before us ; and then he returned , and said , He was afraid , and desired us to come nearer , which we did ; and he went forward again . In a little time he whistled , and fired a Pistol ; upon which we all ran up , and a Man met me , and clapt a Pistol to my Breast . He did not know me in the dark , nor I him , till he spoke , and then I found he was one of the Frenchmen who went before hand to watch the Prisoner . Coming all into the Shoulder of Mutton-Path , Mr. Manisire searched the Prisoner , and found a Guinea in his Pocket ; and when we came to the Salmon and Ball , we agreed to be searched all round , that no Exceptions might be taken , by searching some , and not others . After the Search , 3 of the Company would go back with Links , to see if the Prisoner had hid no Money in the Bank ; and while they were gone , the Prisoner call 'd his Master aside into another Room . I do n't know what Discourse they had together ; but when they came out , we 3 likewise went to the Shoulder-of-Mutton-Fields to look for the Money . We met the other 3 with Links , and the Prisoner desired they might be put out , which was done ; and coming near the Place , there was a Farmer with a Lanthorn looking for the Money too ; for I suppose he had heard something of the Matter . Mr. Manisire beckon 'd for the Farmer to go away ; and then beckon 'd me to go away too , which I did , and left them in the dark . Prisoner . The Things were lost on Friday Morning . I advis 'd my Master to get some Bills printed for the stopping them . He did not approve of this , but advertised them on the Monday following , and the same Evening Mr. Dutems receiv 'd a Letter , to send me or the Girl to meet the Man in the Field . I went with my Master and several others ; but they stopt on this side the Place appointed , and sent me forward . When I had walk 'd about for 2 or 3 Minutes , a tall thin Man in a laced Hat call 'd to me , and said , I believe you are the young Man - have you brought the Money ? No , says I . Why so ? says he . Because , says I , my Master is afraid you have not got the Goods . Yes , but I have , says he , for here they be ; and with that he put a Part of them in my Hand , and bid me come next Night and bring the Money , and be sure to come alone . So I went back to my Master , and we all went home , and came again next Night . My Master proposed , that I should give the Thief 10 Counters instead of Guineas ; but I was afraid the Thief would discover the Cheat , and so my Life would be in Danger , and therefore I would not undertake it . Then my Master gave me ten Guineas : But as I went along , I began to consider , that my Master would be very glad to save his ten Guineas , and so I hid 9 Guineas in the Bank , and gave the Thief 10 Counters , and he return 'd me one for my Civility . Court . Was any Counters found upon the Prisoner when he was search 'd . Mr. Dubois . I found no Counters about him . Mr. Manisire . Nor I , and yet we searched him every where ; all his Pockets , his Coat , Shoes and Stockings , after we had found one Guinea , in hopes of finding the Rest . Court . The Prisoner gives a good Reason for refusing to impose the Counters upon the Thief , for he says , he was afraid of a Discovery ; and this appears natural ; but it 's by no means natural to suppose , that this Terror should vanish , and his Mind should change so suddenly . And it 's very unaccountable , that he should hide only 9 Guineas in the Bank : If he did it for Security , why did he not hide all the 10 ? And if he intended to return the Money to his Master , why did he so long conceal where it was , and pretend he had given it to the Thief ? Prisoner . When I had concluded to impose upon the Thief , by giving him Counters instead of Guineas for the Goods , I confess , that , having such an Opportunity , I did design afterwards to defraud my Master of the Money , and therefore I put one Guinea in my Pocket , to make believe , that I had really given the Thief the Money , ( tho ' I gave him only the Counters ) and that he had return 'd me that Guinea for my Trouble . Mr. Bowen . The Prisoner was my Scholar , I have known him 4 Years . I taught him Writing and Arithmetick , and he always behaved very well and deservingly . Juryman . Pray my Lord let the School-master see the Letter . Mr. Bowen . I do n't take this to be his Writing . 'T is nothing like what he wrote when he was with me . Court . No doubt but a Person would disguise his Hand on such an Occasion ; but sure you can distinguish betwixt a natural and a feign 'd Hand - Do you think this is natural ? Mr. Bowen . I ca n't say as to that . A great many Witnesses appear 'd to the Prisoner 's Reputation , and gave him a very good Character . Court . To Mr. Manisire . Did you ever propose to deliver the Counters to the Prisoner . Mr. Manisire . No ; I did not , but some such Thing was mentioned . Mr. Dubois . It was I who propos 'd it , upon which the Prisoner said , he would not go for the World . Then said his Master ; well , give him 10 Guineas . Pray do n't go to deceive me now , says the Prisoner , for it may be of very ill Consequence . The Jury found him Guilty to the value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 15. William Jellard , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of GERARD Bothomly , and stealing a Flannel Curtain , and 13 Brass-rings , value 1 s. April 17 . in the Night . Charles Westridge . Last Tuesday Night , I made fast the Window-shutters of Mr. Bothomly 's House - 't is a Corner House in King-street in St. Ann 's Westminster ; and at a little past 1 on Wednesday Morning , I heard something rattle as I lay a Bed . I call 'd out , Who 's there ? But Nobody answer 'd - At 3 o ' Clock the Watchman came by . I call 'd to him , and bid him see if the Window-shutters next King-street were shut - He said , Yes , but the Bar was down , and the Pin was in the Window . Then lighting a Candle , I found the Shutters close , but the Sash within was thrown up . We searched in the Wash-house below Stairs , and looking up the Chimney , there stood the Prisoner upon a Wooden-perch . Here 's the Thief , says I , stay Watchman and I 'll call more help . So I got 2 more Watchmen , and carried the Prisoner to the Watch-house , where this Window-Curtain was found upon him - He had liv 'd a Servant in the House , about 17 Days before . He had seven Shillings a Week and his Diet , as I have now . He said he got in , to get some Victuals , and took the Curtain to wrap it in . I told him , he knew my Master kept no Victuals in the House , but order 'd all to be given away - I had key 'd the Pin of the Window my self , when I went to Bed ; but the Spring of the Key was broke , so that in turning the Pin round , the Key dropt out . - Denton , Watchman . Mr. Westridge call 'd me , to see if the Window was fast ; I told him the Bar was down . He let me in . I saw the Sash was quite up . In the Wash-house Chimney , we found the Prisoner with his Shoes down at the Heels . He said , he was a Fool for coming there . Ralph Reneau . I was call 'd at 3 , and found the Prisoner standing on a Bar 5 or 6 Foot up the Chimney . He cry 'd out , and desired we 'd let him come down ; and then he said he 'd tell us how he came there . So when he was got down he told us , he was a Fool and only came to get some Victuals . Another Watchman deposed to the same Effect . Mathew Prime , Beadle . At past 3 the Prisoner was brought to the Watch-house all over Soot . I search 'd him , and found upon him this Curtain , a Cabbage-net . 4 Redherring 's , a Huswife and a Thimble . Prisoner . I own I was in the House , but the Sash was lifted up before . Juryman . Does the Pin go thro ' the Shutter ? Westridge . No ; the Shutters are fastned with a Bar , and the Pin goes thro ' the Bar and Jamb of the Window . So that he could put the Pin in the hole , and then go in , and pull the Shutters close after him . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 16 Joseph Bingham , was indicted for stealing 15 Ounces of Hair , 9 Bottles of Brandy , and 5 Pints of Rum , the Goods of Thomas and Richard Jeffries , and James Dixon , April 22 . Guilty .

Receiv 'd of Thomas Page , Esq ; the Sum of 10 l. 8 s. in full of all Demands by me George Copeland ; with an Intent to defraud George Copeland , and did forge and counterfeit , and cause to be forged and counterfeited , the said Receipt , with an Intent to defraud Thomas Page , Esq ; and that he did publish the said forg 'd and counterfeit Receipt , knowing it to be forg 'd and counterfeit , with an Intent to defraud George Copeland ; and did publish the said forged and counterfeit Receipt , knowing it to be such , with an Intent to defraud Thomas Page , Esq ; He was a 2d time indicted for forging and counterfeiting , and causing to be forg 'd and counterfeited , a Receipt for 17 l. 8 s. in these Words , July 20 . 1732 .

Second Indictment . Council . Thomas Wells , Look on that Receipt - do you know who writ it ? Wells . Yes ; I wrote it by the Prisoner 's Directions , and sign 'd the Name of William Brown . Council . Was Brown present when you did it ? Wells . No . Court . When was it done ? Wells . It 's so long ago that I have forgot the time ; but it was the same Day as it is dated . Court . Where was it done ? Wells . In Bond-street . Court . How came you to do it ? Wells . The Prisoner was Cook to Thomas Page Esq ; and used to buy Provisions for the Family . He came to me one Day , and said , he had been to pay Mr. Brown the Butcher 27 l. 8 s. But Mr. Brown not being at home , he had paid his Wife , but had taken no Receipt , because she could not write . And he said , his Lady was going out of Town , and he was oblig 'd to settle his Accounts before she went , and therefore he desired me to write a Receipt in Mr. Brown 's Name ; which I did , not doubting but he had paid the Money , because he was a Man that bore a very good Character . Then the Receipt was read in Court . Mrs . Page . The Prisoner , deliver 'd this Receipt to me , as the true Receipt of William Brown , about a year ago . First Indictment . Mrs . Page . The Prisoner gave this Receipt for 10 l. 8 s. As the Receipt of George Copeland . Charles Copeland . George Copeland , was my Father . He was a Poulterer , he is now Dead . I know his Hand very well , and I believe neither the Body of this Receipt , nor his Name were his Writing . Court . Is there any Similitude ? Copeland . Yes a great deal ; for it is not all like his Writing . Sarah Copeland . George Copeland was , my Husband . I am well acquainted with his hand Writting , and this is not his Writing , neither the Name , nor the Body of the Receipt . Thomas Bird . I knew Mr. Copeland 's Hand , and this is not his Writing . Then the Receipt was read . Mr. Farly . The Prisoner was brought before John Lawton Esq ; on the 18th of this Month , and acknowledg 'd this Confession to be his own hand Writing , and that the Contents of it were true . Then the Confession was read . In this Confession , dated March 29 . 1734- besides the 2 Receipts in the Indictment , He acknowledged he procur 'd a Receipt sign 'd with the Name of Tho Harris , for 9 l. 6 s. Another for 10 l. 9 s. and 8 d. sign 'd Sarah Copeland , and another for 28 l. 4 s. and 3 d. sign 'd William Brown , to be forg 'd , that he deliver 'd to Mrs . Page as true Receipts ; that the Money was never paid to , nor the Receipts sign 'd by the Persons whose Names are subscrib 'd thereto . That Thomas Wells , wrote 2 of these 5 , and that John Hanford , wrote one ; but that he had forgot who wrote the other two . Court , to Wells . Have a Care for the future how you write Receipts in other Persons Names . Prisoner . I am very sorry for what I have done . When I first began , I had no Intent of wronging my Master - It was done foolishly , and for want of Thought . I had been extravagant , and could not settle my Accounts ; but I was in hopes of making it up before I was discover 'd - But I can not excuse my self - I might have done well if I would - My Master and Lady were like a Father and Mother to me , and the more is my Guilt , in making such ungrateful Returns for their Goodness - I hope my Misfortunes may be a Warning to all others - I know not what to say - I beg for Mercy - And if I live , I hope God will assist me to live better , and to make some Amends for my past Offences . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 22. Mercy Hornby , of Stoke-Newington , was indicted for the Murther of her Female bastard Infant , by casting it alive into a Privy , by which Casting it receiv 'd one mortal Bruise on the left side of the Head , of which mortal Bruise it instantly dy 'd , March 15 . She was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murther . Elizabeth Husk . Friday Morning was 5 Weeks , about 9 o ' Clock , I met Mrs Pain , who said she was going to see the Prisoner at Stoke-Newington . An Hour afterwards , I saw Mrs Pain again , and she said the Prisoner was very bad ; so I went to see the Prisoner . She was sitting up in her Bed , and I asked her how she did ? She said , very bad at her Head and Stomach . When I came down , I asked Mrs Pain if she had seen nothing ? For the Kitchen was in Disorder , and had been wash 'd and sanded , and there was a Bloody-apron . She said she had seen something , and that the Prisoner had thrown something down the Vault . I stept over the Way , ( for I live opposite to where the Prisoner lives ) and told my Mistress . She bid me light a Candle , and look in the Vault . I did , and saw a Child there ; but I was so frighted , that I could not take much notice . I sent for help to take it out , and then I saw only a little Blood on the Head of it . It was a Female , and seem 'd to be new born . Court . Did you observe the Navel , or any thing about it , belonging to a new born Child ? E. H. No . It was filthy with the Soil of the Privy . Prisoner . Was it a Stone Kitchen ? E. H. No . A boarded Floor ? Prisoner . Was I alone , or was any of the Family in the House ? E. H. I do n't know - I saw none but you when I first came . Prisoner . Was the Child cover 'd in the Vault ? E. H. No . It lay clear . Prisoner . How deep was the Vault ? E. H. I do n't know . Prisoner . Was it a slight Bruise on the side of the Head , or a large one ? E. H. I did not search - A Midwife was sent for after the Child was found ; but she did not come till next Day . Margaret Pain . The Prisoner sent for me by a Neighbour 's Girl between 9 and 10 in the Morning . She let me into the Kitchen her self . I ask 'd what ail 'd her ? She said , she was not very well , nor had not been well since Whitsuntide : That she had been very bad that Morning , and had been at the Vault ; but was now something better , and could eat a little Water gruel . I made her some , and then she went to Bed , and bid me lock the outer Door , and take the Key . There was Nobody else in the House - The Kitchen was a little out of Order ; I saw it had been mopp 'd up , but I saw no foul Clothes . We did not let her know that the Child was found , till her Master and Mistress came down , and that was between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon . And then I asked her how she came to do so ? And she said , the Devil prompted her . Prisoner . What did you understand I meant by saying so ? - That I carried it to the Place , or that I murder 'd it ? M. P. I do n't know what you meant . Mary Fauks , Midwife . On Saturday the 16th of March , I was sent for by the Prisoner , to free her of the After-birth , and I made her a free Woman and left her safe . I was sent for on the Friday , but could not go , - I saw the Child , it was as fine a Female as ever I set my Eyes on , and I do n't question but it was full grown ; for I believe it was 3 quarters ( of a Yard long ) and I believe it was born alive , for I ca n't think so large a dead Child could make it 's own way . There was a great Bruise on this side of the Head ? Prisoner . Might not that come by a Fall at it 's Birth ? M. F. I ca n't say that . Prisoner . Did not you take some Child-Bed-Linnen out of my Trunk . M. F. Yes ; a Shirt , a Blanket , and a Night-Cap , a Biggin , and a long Stay ; but these I did not see till Monday , and it 's much to be fear 'd , that you did not put them there ; for indeed I was inform 'd they were borrow 'd of a Neighbour . Court . That 's no Evidence - You must not swear what you heard , but only what you know . Mr. Coulson , Surgeon . I found a large Contusion on the side of the Child's-head , which I believe was the Cause of it 's Death . The Bruise might happen by the Child 's falling from her , for a Child falls with a prodigious force . Thomas Pain . I built the Vault not long ago , and was sent for , to take the Child out ; but it was taken out by Mr. Jordan . The Vault is but 6 Foot deep , and the Depth of the Soil was not above 3 Inches , or 3 and a half . The Breadth of the Seat is 22 Inches ; there is no Cross-bars within . The Back of it lies open , and the Bottom is not paved , but is a soft Sand . Prisoner . Could the Child receive such a Bruise as to kill it , by falling down that way . Surgeon . - I think not . John Jourdan . The Child lay upon its back , and did not seem to be daub 'd at all . I got a Ladder , and went down 4 or 5 Rounds , and try 'd to take it with a Rake ; but when I had raised it 2 or 3 foot , it fell down again , and that daub 'd it pretty much . There was a Bruise and some Blood about it 's Head , but the Skin was not broke . Prisoner . I was taken very bad in Bed , between 5 and 6 in the Morning . I came down Stairs , and call 'd for help as well as I could , but there was Nobody else in the House . The next Door was an Ale-house , and a Noise being there , I believe they could not hear me . And being violent ill , and in great Extremity of Pain , I was deliver 'd in the Kitchen . I never saw the Child move , nor never laid Hands on it ; but it got that Bruise on the Head by falling from me , and then in a fright I took it up and carried it to the Vault . Court . Read the Statute the 21st of K. James the I. Chap . 27. Clerk Reads . Whereas many lewd Women , that have been deliver 'd of bastard Children , to avoid their Shame , and to escape Punishment , do secretly bury or conceal the Death of their Children , and after , if the Child be found Dead , the said Women do alledge , that the said Child was born Dead ; whereas it falleth out sometimes ( although hardly it is to be proved ) that the said Child or Children were murther 'd by the said Women , their lewd Mothers , or by their Assent or Procurement : For the preventing therefore of this great Mischief , be it enacted by the Authority of this present Parliament , That if any Woman , after one Month next ensuing the End of this Session of Parliament , be deliver 'd of any issue of her Body , Male or Female , which being born alive should , by the Laws of this Realm , be a Bastard , and that she endeavour privately , either by drowning or secret burying thereof , or any other way , either by herself or the procuring of others , so to conceal the Death thereof , as that it may not come to Light , whether it were born alive or not , but be conceal 'd . In every such case , the said Mother so offending shall suffer Death as in Cases of Murder , except such Mother can make proof , by one Witness at least , that the Child ( whose Death was by her so intended to be conceal 'd ) was born dead ? The Jury found her Guilty . Death . 23 , 24. Thomas Guy , was indicted with Thomas Tiller , not yet taken , for the Murder of William Harbor , by casting him to the Ground , striking , and kicking him there by giving him several mortal Bruises , April 16 , of which he languish 'd till April 18th , and then dyed He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for Manslaughter . Thomas Tiller , got drunk , and meeting with the Deceas 'd as he came from Windsor , they quarrel 'd and went to fighting ; the Prisoner riding by accidentally , got off his Horse , to part them . He told the Deceas 'd that he used foul play , and than gave him 2 or 3 knocks . The Deceased dyed in 2 days . Two Surgeons swore , that upon inspecting his Body they believ 'd he dyed of the Cholick , and his Widow , depos 'd that he never had the Cholick in his Life .

William Bennet . The Prisoner was my Servant . He ran away on Monday Night , and next Morning I found my Drawers broke , and mist my Goods and Money . Mr Smith a Poulterer sent his Prentice with me to look for him , and we found him at a Brandy House the corner of Coulstan 's Court in Drury-Lane . I found a Silver Spoon upon him , and the Box the Rings were in , but the Rings were gone . This Ring I had from Ann Young , the Woman at the Baudy-house , where we took him . She said , he had made her a Present of it , but as it was a Robbery , I was welcome to it again . I subpaena 'd her Sister , but She has not thought fit to come . He said he had pawn 'd one Ring in Hemings 's Row , and had given 2 more to another Whore at a Bawdy-house in Princes-street ; but we could not find her out . He had got 6 s. and 2 pence halfpenny left of all the Money that he robb 'd me of , and I bid him keep that , for it might be of Service to him - He confessed that he broke one Lock , and took out my Goods and Money . Mary Bennet , depos 'd to the same effect . Derrick Scarsborough , gave the same Account of taking the Priso . and his Confession adding , That the Prisoner said , that after he , had robb 'd his Master he took Coach , and threw the Money about to the Mob in the Streets . Benjamin Dennison . I saw the Spoon and Box taken out of the Prisoner 's Pocket . Elizabeth Hall . My Name is Swain , but they mistook my Name in the Subpoena , my Master is a Poulterer in Clare-Market . The Prisoner came to our House in a Coach , I think it was about 7 on Monday Night the 11th of April [ March . ] He had then 4 Guineas and a half , and 9 s. in Silver , and I saw the Rings and put them on my Finger . He was very much fuddled , and my Mistress desir 'd he might be taken away , she did not care to have drunken Fellows in the House . The Prisoner had liv 'd with Esq ; Lutty , and Esq ; Varney , and Esq ; Hoare , and had always behav 'd very well . Thomas French . I live with Mr. Smith , the Poulterer . The Prisoner came to our House in a Coach , and Mr. Gambier 's Man of Lincolns-Inn desir 'd my Mistress to let him be there . So they drove to Mr. Gambier 's Stables in Portugal Row which is over-against our Shop , and then the Prisoner got out , and came into our Kitchen . Prisoner . I hope you ' l consider me .

Jane Jones , alias Marsh , was indicted for assaulting Jane Cardwell , in the House of Ann Jones , and robbing her of a pair of Gold Ear-Rings , Feb. 29 . Jane Cardwell . 2 Months ago I call 'd at Mrs. Finchliff 's . She keeps a Brandy-Shop behind Pouls , and Sarah Hoare was with me , and there was the Prisoner . She threw a Glass of Gin in my Face , and fell upon me , and beat me , and tore all my Things to Pieces , and threw me down , and took me by the Ears , and beat my Head against the Ground , and I cry 'd out Murder 40 times , and nobody came to help me , and I lost my Senses and my Ear-Rings ; but I do n't say that she took 'em designedly , nor when she took 'em , nor whether she took 'em or no ; but I had 'em when she laid , me down , and I mist 'em when my Friend took me up ; and here 's my Ears , and you may see the Marks where it was split down when she tore my Ear-rings away ; and she had no Occasion to serve me so , for I ne'er set Eyes on her before that Night . But howsomever I believe the Gentlewoman might be in Liquor , and out of her right Senses - and after that she kept out of the Way , and Sarah Hoare took her at the Dog Tavern in Ludgate-street , where She had got a Fellow with her . Sarah Hoare . It was true the Priso . fell upon her , and threw a Glass of Gin , in her Face , and cut her Face and her Neck with the Glass , and said , Damn the Bitch , let her take that , till more comes , and tore her Hat with her Teeth , thus - you may see plain enough what a Condition it 's in . I thought in my Conscience she had kill 'd the Girl , but I lent her a Hand up , and her left Ear was tore down , and it was all bloody ; and I saw it that Night as soon as we came to our Senses again ; and , says I , Jenny , your Ear is all bloody , and she said she had lost her Ear rings , and so she had ; but I ca n't think neither that the Gentlewoman did it with a design to rob her . Prisoner . Had she any Surgeon to cure her Wounds ? Hoare . No . - But there 's a Scar still to be seen in her left Ear - Do but look Sir - Turn your Head about Jenny - See here now , is not this a Scar ? Juryman . Here is a little Scar indeed Prisoner . That 's because her Ear rings were Brass , and they fester 'd her Ears . Cardwell . Brass , Madam ? Brass ? I 'd have you to know they were right good Silver , tho ' I say it . Prisoner . You swore they were Gold before Sir Richard Brocas . Cardwell . They were wash 'd over with Gold , and they cost 7 s. 6 d. Court . They are laid to be Gold in the Indictment , and therefore the Prisoner must be acquitted . And the Jury acquitted her . 40.

And 2 Watchmen came , and carried me to the Watch house , where I was search 'd all over . David Jones . I am Watchman of Cheap-side , and all as I know is , that I know nothing of the Man , for I never saw him till after he was brought to the Watch-house ; and I did not see the Woman at all , for she was sent to the Compter , before I came to the Watch-house . But I am possible she was never search 'd at the Watch-house . Court . How can you be sure of that , when you did not see her ? Jones . I am very sure of it , for my Brother Watchman told me so . The Jury Acquitted her . 41. Mary Brace , was indicted for privately stealing a pair of silver Candlesticks , val . 8 l. the Property of Robert Kendrick , in his House , Feb. 28 . Mr. Kendrick . On the 28th of February , I lost a Pair of silver Candlesticks out of my House in George-Yard Lombard-street . I enquired who had been there that Day , and was told , that the Prisoner had been to visit one of my Servants . I sent for her next Morning , and took her and my Servant with some others before Sir Edward Bellamy to be sworn , and the Prisoner was as ready to swear as any of them . But Sir Edward said he suspected her , and advised us to search her Lodgings , and my Servant went , and found the Candlesticks there ; but the Crest was taken out as nicely as if it had been done by a Silversmith . I went to see her in the New Jail in Southwark , and she confest the Fact , and said that she took the Crest out her self with the Scissars . Jeremy Amat . The Prisoner came to my Fellow-Servant .

Sir Edward advised us to search her Lodgings , and I and 2 more went . Mrs. Lee her Landlady produced them in 5 Minutes ; and then we went before Justice Nichols . The Prisoner was committed to the New-Jail , where she confest to me and my Fellow-Servant , that she put the Candlesticks in her Gown , one in each side , and pin 'd them up ; and that she took out the Crest the same Night with her Scissars . Mary Sawyer . These are the Candlesticks - The Prisoner came to see me between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon . She staid but a little while , and about 7 they were miss 'd . I went to her Lodgings next Morning ; and she came readily , and 6 of us went before Sir Edward , and took our Oaths - Then we went again to the Prisoner 's Lodging , and Jane Howland ( who lodg 'd with the Prisoner ) beckon 'd me down , and asked if any thing was lost ? I said , Yes ; a pair of Silver Candlesticks - Then follow me , says she , and going with her , we met Mrs. Lee , with the Candlesticks under her Apron - and she told me the Name was scratch 'd out . I said to the Prisoner , Mary , how could you do so ? She made no Answer , but when she came before the Justice , she own 'd that she took them , and eras 'd the Crest . Jane Lee . The Prisoner lodg 'd five Weeks at my House , and behav 'd well . On the 1st of March about Noon , I went to make my Bed , and found the Candlesticks under . I was surpriz 'd , and ask 'd my Husband and Jane Howland if they knew how they came ? They said , No .

Catherine Murphey . About 10 at Night , as I and this Woman ( Elizabeth Dugard ) were going down Holbourn towards Shoe-Lane , the Prisoner came behind me , and without speaking a Word , took hold of me , and cut my Cloak all to Pieces . I look 'd back , and he gave me a Blow on my Nose , and set it a Spinning with Blood . His Wife came next Day and told me , that he did it with a Case-Knife . Court . Were you acquainted with the Prisoner ? Murphey . Yes ; we were well acquainted for 2 or 3 Years . I knew him , and he knew me in a very particular manner - He took up a Knife at my Lodgings , and swore he would be my Death , if I would not maintain him - And another time , he cut this Gown a-cross , intending to cut my Flesh . I ca n't disown but I have been an unfortunate Woman . And when I had got Money to give him , he 'd be pleasant enough ; but if I had none , then he would call me all the Bitches in Life , and bid me , turn out , and knock down Men in the Streets , and whatever I could get from other Persons , bring to him , and then I should be welcome ; for he did not care what he drove me to - But I design to reform before it 's long - Here 's the Cloak - You may see how he has hammock 'd it - I am sure I was forced to pay for it , for I had borrow 'd it to disguise my self , for fear he should know me , and do me some Mischief if he met me . Elizabeth Dugard . I saw the Prisoner cut the Cloak in this manner , and she gave him no Provocation . I was frighted , and ran towards Fetter-Lane , and she ran another way . Prisoner . As I was going home I saw these 2 Women , who are both Women of the Town ; and this Mrs. Murphey call 'd me Thief and Blackguard-Dog , and said if I did not come to see her as I used to do , she would hang me ; and now she has taken me at a Non-plush about this Cloak that was cut , because I wo n't make it good , and because I wo n't live with her . When I first fell into her Company , she robb 'd me of a Moidore that my Wife work 'd hard for . But I was drunk , and she put me to Bed in Magpye-Alley , and I did not know where I was when I waked . And so I got out of Bed , and got a Warrant against her - I am a Butcher by Trade , and I live in Middle-Row in Holbourn ; but now I deal in Horses , and I have got a good honest virtuous Wife as lives by Bread , and now she 's ready to lye in .

I must be burnt in the Flames of Hell fire - I live with Mr. Pilkington at the Dover-Castle Ale-house in Quakers-street in Spittlefields . A Gentleman came to change a Guinea ; my Master said he had not Silver enough , and sent me to change it in the Neighbourhood . I went to 3 Places , and could not get it changed ; and so I came back again . But my Master bid me go to another Place , and there I changed it for half a Guinea and 10 s. 6 d. in Silver ; and as I was going home with it , the Prisoner took me in his Arms just by my Master 's Door , and swore , Damn his Blood , he 'd cut my Throat , if I did not deliver all my Money . He rumbled in his Pocket to find a Knife . The Money was in my Hand , and he put my Hand into his Mouth and bit it , and some of the Money fell into his Mouth . I cry 'd Murder , and Stop Thief , and he was taken by 2 or 3 Men about 100 Yards from my Master 's Door . I went up to them , and he said he was innocent . But the Men said , they heard the Money fall , and I pick 'd up 6 Pence , and others found more in the Kennel just by him . It was about 11 at Night , and he stopt me ; I saw him plainly by the Light of a Lamp . John Pilkington . My Neighbour came to change a Guinea ; but not having Silver enough , sent my Boy to get it changed . He came back without Change , and I sent him again : He had not been gone above 3 or 4 Minutes , when I heard at next Door crying Murder , and Stop Thief . Court . Whose Guinea was it ? John Pilkington . I had known the Man by sight a pretty while ; but did not know his Name right and so I desir 'd him on this Occasion to write it , which he did , and here it is - John Foresee . Court . That 's not sufficient Evidence . The Case is capable of better ; you should have brought him here . John Pilkington . I can fetch him presently . Court . Go then . Let the Prisoner stand by a little . Foresee comes in . John Foresee . I went to Mr. Pilkington 's to change a Guinea . He sent his Lad out , but the Lad return 'd without Change , and so he was sent again . In a short space , we heard a Cry of Murder - Says Mr. Pilkington , that 's my Boy 's Voice ; and so in half a Minute we ran out . We soon came up to the Prisoner , but he said he was innocent . The Boy shew 'd me his Hand . I saw the Print of Teeth in it , and it was a little bloody , but not so much as for the Blood to run down . There was some Money found just where the Prisoner stood . One Man found about 7 s. 6 d. and another about 2 s. 6 d. - It was my Guinea that the Boy had to change . Matthew Baker . Going home with John Quail from my Mother 's in Wheeler-street , we past by Pilkington 's Door , and being got about 100 yards beyond it , the Boy cry 'd Murder and Thieves . We suspected a Robbery and stood up . We heard a Man run , and we saw him when he came within 3 or 4 yards of us , by the light of a Chandler 's Shop . So we stopp 'd him ; he struggled to get loose , and he said he was innocent . But we held him till the Boy came , and then I heard some Money fall . The Boy said , Hold him fast , he has robb 'd me of a Guinea We got a Candle from the Chandler 's Shop to look for the Money . The Boy picked up 6 pence , and others found in the Kennel about 10 s. in all . Prisoner . There 's a great many Alleys thereabouts , and I told you that it was not I but a Man in Black , who was run down such an Alley ; I was following him . Baker . Yes he said so ; but we saw none but he , nor heard any , for the Streets were quite still . John Quail depos 'd to the same Effect . Prisoner . They said they 'd stop me whether I was the right Man or no . Quail . We said no such thing . Prisoner . I was coming home . It was a rainy dark Night , and I could not see 2 yards before me ; And then how could I know the Boy had the Money . My Wife and Friends knowing me to be innocent . went to Mr. Pilkington , and he told them , she 'd hang me if it was in his Power ; but if she had 40 or 50 l. to give , may be he might be easy . Ann Stodden . I was at Pilkington 's House , and the Prisoner 's Wife begg 'd him to make things easy ; and he ask 'd her , if she could make him recompence for the Damage he had receiv 'd ? he said , Yes , as much as lies in my Power-Can you make up 40 or 50 l. ? says he . And she said , No . The Prisoner is my Brother in-Law . Pilkington . I never said any such thing . Watchman . The Prisoner was sober , civil , and sedate . When he was carried before the Justice , Pilkington push 'd the Boy up , and bid him be brisk . Francis Crouzee . I always heard the Prisoner was a very honest Man He was recommended to me as a deserving Object of Charity , and I have sometimes reliev 'd him . Mrs. Lucas . He was my Lodger 6 Months , my House was open to him , and I never found nor heard that he was any ways dishonest - This was 4 Months ago , and I have known but little of him since then .

William Cornthwaite . I am a Taylor by Trade , and the Prisoner is my Book-keeper , - I allow him 50 l. a year , On Friday-evening March 22. James Trutor , a Button-maker whom I deal with , came to me and said , he believ 'd I had a Servant who is a great Rogue . Why so , says I , Because , says , he an old Man offer 'd to sell me some Buttons for 3 s. and 6 d. a Dozen , which are worth 7 s. and 6 d. and I believe they were yours , because your Man D - came to me in August last , and shew 'd me a Pattern of Buttons , and said , that such an old Man had got a Parcel to sell , and they would come cheap ; and the old Man came accordingly , and I bought them . And the old Man coming to Day with more , I began to be suspicious , and so appointed him to come again to Morrow , at 2 a-Clock . This old Man is Thomas Carver , the Prisoner 's Father-in-law ; he came at the time appointed , and was carry 'd before Justice Deveil . I know the Buttons and Bags - Carver said , at first , that he had them from a Shop keeper in Brentford ; but he deny 'd that again and would not own where he had them , 'till the Prisoner came , and then said , he never saw the Buttons before . Court . What Carver said of the Prisoner is no Evidence . Prisoner . Did you ever miss any Buttons ? And when ? Mr. Cornthwaite . On this Information I examin 'd narrowly , and mist these and other Parcels - Indeed I had suspected the Prisoner some time before . For I had a Box in which I keep nothing but Gold and Silver-lace , and I trusted no body with the Key but the Prisoner . I look 'd into this Box one day , and found a Gross of Gold Thread Buttons which I never put there . This made me suspect , that he had a design to carry them off . I ask 'd him how they came there . He seem 'd confus 'd and made me no satisfactory Answer . Prisoner . Did you ever enquire after what you mist ? Mr. Cornthwaite . Yes ; I have often enquir 'd of you , but not of my Workmen . Prisoner . But did you ever tax me with wronging you ? Mr. Cornthwait . No ; for tho ' I had long been jealous of you , I had no business to let you know it , because I wanted to make a Discovery . Prisoner . Did you miss that Gross before you found them in the Lace-box ? Mr. Cornthwaite . I ca n't say that I did , but when I found them , I knew they were taken out of my Drawers . Prisoner . Is not that a Publick Drawer your Shop , where 30 Men are at Work . Mr. Cornthwaite . Yes ; I keep a Quantity there in readiness , if my Men should want any when I am out of the way . Prisoner . Did not you order me to clear that open Drawer , and put the Buttons in the Lace-box to keep them from Tarnishing . Mr. Cornthwaite . I have order 'd you to that Drawer , but not to put the Buttons the Box Prisoner . Did not you take a Parcel of French Buttons out , and bid me put them by , and give me some odd Buttons to put into the Drawer ? Mr. Cornthwite . I do n't remember any such Circumstance , Mr. D - James Trutor . I know dis Man de Preeonar , dat he come to me last August , and ay , dat his Friend take some Buttong for a Debt , and he shew me de Pattern , and if I vill buy dem , his Friend dat vas an old Man vill come to Morrow . I ask a him , for vat he no sell dem to him Master . He say as he no care for dat . So dis Old Man came vid 12 Dozen of de Silver Coat Buttong , and 12 Dozen of de Silver Breast , and I give him 30 s. for dem . And he came again vid more de 22 of March ; but I bid him come to Morrow , vish he did , and bring 10 Dozen of de Silver Coat , and 10 Dozen of de Silver Breast , and 5 Dozen de Gold Coat , and 5 Dozen de Gold Breast ; and den I take him up vid de Coonstauble , and carry him before de Shustice , and dare he say dat he have dem from Brentford - And von Time in October . I bring mine Bill dat came to 24 l. to Mr. Cornthwaite , and de Presonar vas dare alone , and he avize me to put down 8 l. more into de Bill - Court . You must not proceed thus - 'T is going into another Fact . Prisoner . I desire he may be heard as to that , because it will shew the Falsehood of - Prosecutor . The Prisoner recommended this Man to me , and now he would impeach his Character . Prisoner . Did I tell you that the Old Man was my Friend ? Trutor . Yes . Prisoner . What are you ? Trutor . A Gold and Silver Buttong Maker . You know dat vary vell - vy you ask me den ? Prisoner to the Prosecutor . Have not you trusted me with 2 or 300 l. at a Time , and particularly when you have been out of Town ? Prosecutor . I may have trusted so much in your Hands , but not when I went out of Town . Prisoner . Was not I always very sober and industrious . Prosecutor . Sober you were ; but I ca n't commend your Industry ; for you were very heedless , Mr. D - George Verney . I believe I sold these Buttons to Mr. Cornthwaite ; I know they are of my Making , and I can swear to the Bags . Prisoner . Might not another Man make such Work . Varney . I know my own Work in particular . Prisoner . But have you sold none of the same Sort to other Persons ? Varney . Yes . Prisoner . Has not my Master told you , that I was a very honest Man ? Varney . I do n't remember - but if he did it , it is a good while ago . James Mailbet . The Old Man equivocated a good while before the Justice , and at last declared that he had the Goods of the Prisoner . Court . That 's not Evidence . Prosecutor . I found some of my Lace on the Prisoner 's Wife 's Shoes . Court . That 's not in the Indictment - Where is this Old Man Carver ? Prosecutor . I call 'd at his Lodging , and was told he was gone in the Country . Just . Deveil . I took his Inf rmation on Oath , and he sign 'd it , and I bound him in 40 l. to appear here and give Evidence . Prosecutor . I would fain have had him secur 'd , and offer 'd Mr. De Veil 20,000 l. Security to indemnify him ; but I found he could not do it . Court . Call Thomas Carver . Officer . Thomas Carver ! Come forth , and give Evidence against Jacob D - or you forfeit your Recognizance . - Nobody Answers . Court . Record his Default - It seems to cast a Reflection on the Prisoner , that his Father-in-Law chuses to forfeit 40 l. rather than appear . Prisoner . I have put my Master in a Method of marking each Piece , and deducting what was cut off , to prevent his Servants from wronging him - He never pretended he had lost any Thing , till I was taken up - I submitted to the low Drudgery of cleaning out his Drawers , with no other Design , than to get an Insight into his Business , which I intended to set up for my Self ; and when he heard of it , he shew 'd his ill Will in aspersing and bespattering my Character . Prosecutor . Did you intend to turn Taylor ? - My Lord he is not capable of it . He was brought up a Mercer ; and I never heard a Word of his having such a Design before he was sent to Newgate-He has endeavour 'd to throw an Imputation of Malice upon me ; but - Court . You need not give your self any trouble about that , for he has made no such thing appear . The Reverend Mr. Morgan . I am desired to appear , and do that Justice to the Prisoner 's Character as I believe he deserves . I have known him several Years . All his Acquaintance have represented his Character in a favourable Light . So far as my Station and Function can be supposed to have an Insight into a Man 's Character , whom I have had a long Intimacy with , I believe him to be an honest Man , and I believe all his Acquaintance have the same Opinion of him . Mr. Truby . I served him with Wine when he kept a Coffee-house , and he paid me very honestly . Mr. Newel . I lived with him at Mr. Langley 's on Ludgate-Hill , and he behav 'd well there . Mr. Herbert . He was my Apprentice , and served me 7 Years faithfully . He has been gone from me 7 or 8 Years , and I have heard nothing amiss of him since .

When my Wife return 'd from Market , the Prisoner ( whom she left to take care of the House ) was gone away . This was on a Saturday ; and an Alms-man afterwards told me , that he saw such a Creature at a House in Shoreditch . We went to the Place , and heard that she had taken a Coach or a Chaise to Kent on Wednesday ; and we pursued , and took her on Thursday , at Badgers-hill in Kent - 'T is on the other side of Green-hive - I found my 2 Rings upon her , and half a Guinea and 6 d. but the Rings are in the Justice 's Hand .

We went thither , and heard she was gone in a Chaise to Badgers-Mount - The Chaise-man told me where he had laid her down . The People of the House at Badgers-Mount deny 'd her ; but we happen 'd to see her as she was making her Escape out of a Window .

John Lindot . I am Drawer at the Fountain in Bartholomew-Lane , This Letter directed to John Reby , was deliver 'd to me by a Man whom I do n't know , and I deliver 'd it to Mr. Reby . Mr. Tidmarsh . I keep the Fountain . Mr. Waldo , with whom John Reby lives , shew 'd me this Letter , and appear 'd very much provok 'd at it ; for he said , he had a very good Opinion of his Servant John Reby , and was resolv 'd to prosecute the Fellow who sent the Letter , if he could meet with him , and therefore desir 'd me to secure any Person that came about it - The Prisoner came next Day , and enquired for Mr. Reby . I ask 'd him if he came about the Letter that was sent the Day before ; he said , Yes ? I came from the Person who sent it . Do you know him ? says I . Yes , says he , very well . Then pray sit down , says I , and I 'll send for Reby and his Master . The Prisoner upon that appear 'd uneasy , and wanted to withdraw . No , says I , you must stay now . Sure you wo n't seize me , says he . Indeed but I will , says I . Then he began to turn his Tale , and said , that he did not come directly from the Person who sent the Letter . That he knew him to be a very wicked Fellow , and knew several others of the Gang who had threatned to swear Sodomy against Reby , and therefore he came purely to save the Young Man 's Reputation . I told him , if that was the Case , he would do a very commendable thing to discover them . Then Mr. Waldo and Reby came in with my Lord-Mayor 's Warrant , and I quitted the Room . Prisoner . I had receiv 'd an Injury from the Person who sent the Letter , and therefore was resolv 'd to render Reby all the Service I could . And Mr. Tidmarsh told me , that I should be well rewarded . Mr. Tidmarsh Yes if you discover 'd the Person who sent the Letter ; and you said you were well acquainted with him . Prisoner . But some of you prevented me , by putting it in the News ; and then the Fellow ran away - when you ask 'd me to sit down , I only said I was going to Leaden hall Market . Court . Is there any Body can prove , that the Prisoner wrote or sent this Letter ? Mr. Tidmarsh . No , we were a little too hasty in seizing him , before we had made a full Discovery . Court . 'T is undoubtedly a very heinous Offence , and deserves a severe Punishment . But the greater the Crime is , the clearer the Proof ought to be - If the Letter is not prov 'd , it can not be read in Court . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 63 Jane Bullock , was indicted for stealing a Gown , the Property of John Lgue , and an Apron , the Property of Sarah Griffin , April 5 . Acquitted .
