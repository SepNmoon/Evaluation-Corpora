Yes , they were ; I was a little in liquor , and I suppose we were all middlingly in drink . Q . If you were in drink , how can you remember this ? Mynet .

I am the officer who was charged with them : this ring I took from Catharine Dixon , it was tied up in the tail of her smock , and she untied her smock , and gave it me . Mynet . That is the ring they took from me . Q. to Townley . Did you take any money upon her ? Townley . No ; I did not search her , she gave me this ring , and wanted me to let her go - the first person I was charged with was Elizabeth Sullivan , and she said the countryman gave her the ring , and she took a slight brass ring off her finger and pretended that was the ring that Mynet gave her . The countryman [ Mynet ] swore before the Justice that Sullivan took it , and gave it to the other , and she ran down stairs with it ; he described the woman very plain , that I should have known her . We could find no body in the house , but Mynet found Catharine Dixon between the cieling of the vault and the tiling Q . Is Dixon the person that took it ? Townley . He swore to both of them - Catharine Dixon was hid in the lost of the house of office . Prisoner Sullivan . I went up with a pot of beer , and I found Dixon and he in the action ; he told her he had no money , but he would give her the ring . Dixon . He lay with me , he said he was short of money , and he gave me the ring : there was a woman in the house who saw him give it me ; he said in the morning he must have the ring , for it was his mother 's ring , and I told him if he would give me the money for it , he should have it . Both guilty * . * The ring , & c. being taken from the prosecutor by force , he might have laid this indictment for a robbery , which would have been a capital offence . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 300 . + Jane Ansley , of St. John Wapping , was indicted for stealing three shirts , value 30 s. and five pair of stockings , value 5 s. the goods of John Watson ; five pillow cases , value 2 s. two shifts , value 3 s. a muslin neckcloth , value 2 d. a handkerchief , value 6 d. an apron , value 12 d. and six guineas , the property of Christopher Scot , in his dwelling-house , May 9 . John Watson . About the 11th of April I lost three shirts and five pair of stockings : the Prisoner confessed at Mr. Scot 's house that she took two shirts , a shift , an apron , and a handkerchief , and that her aunt Hannah Maddison put her upon it . She proved before me , that her aunt was in the street at the time of her stealing them : she confessed likewise , that she had sent them to one Mrs. Skevington 's in Ratcliff Highway to be pawned . I went to Mrs. Skevington 's , and found one shirt that was my own , two shifts , one handkerchief , one neckcloth , and an apron . I spoke to the Prisoner 's aunt , and the Prisoner did own it , and offered to make a debt of it if I would excuse it . Q . How much money was found upon the Prisoner ? Watson . There were three guineas , and 13 s. and 6 d. in silver , she said the remaining part of the six guineas she had laid out in clothes : the money was found in her box . Q . Did she acknowledge she took it out of Mr. Scot 's drawers ? Watson . She said it was Mr. Scot 's , I can not be positive she said she took it out of his drawers . Christiana Scot . The Prisoner was my servant , she took from me six guineas , two shifts , & c. which were my property - they were in my drawers . Q . Did the Prisoner say from what place she took them ? Scot . Her aunt was at our house , and I believe she took most part of the things herself . Q . How did she behave before this ? Scot . Very well , she was a very good natured creature , I believe it was occasioned by her aunt , for she told her she was going into a house where there was money and good linen , and ordered her to bring them to her . The Prisoner had no part of the money the goods were pawned for , and I have the goods that she bought with the money , so that the loss is but trifling . It not being proved that she stole the goods and money in the dwelling-house , the Jury found her guilty of the Felony only . [ Branding . See summary . ] 301.

Mary Powis . I went to bed the third of June between one and two , and about five o'clock in the morning that same Abraham Trotter took down both my shutters , and shoved up the sash window - I know him very well , I have seen him a great many times ; he took some of the things , went out at the window , came back again , and took all the brasses off the shelf . The second time he came , one Richard Downs , a neighbour , seeing the shutters were open , came and looked , and the Prisoner said to him , What do you want with us ? I saw the Prisoner in the house , and he said , do not be frightened , he said he would send for my things , and he wanted to go away . I told him he was as safe there then as he had been all along ; then Richard Downs and I went for my things to the house where we were directed by the Prisoner , and left him in my house with some men . We met his wife , and she pretended to be dunny ; then I brought the things back to my house ; now , says he , you will let me go , Mrs. Powis : yes , said I , to be sure , you have been favourable to me , and so I will be to you . Richard Downs . I was coming along by Mrs. Powis 's house about five of the clock , and saw the shutters open , and a man in the house ; I asked him what he was doing , he said , he was doing no harm . I called Mrs. Powis down , she said her gown and some other things that were in a basket were gone . We asked him what he had done with them , he told us he had carried them home : we went and brought them back , and he acknowledged before the Justice that he took them . Elizabeth Cook . I live in the house with Mrs. Powis , between five and six o'clock in the morning I heard a man say , make haste down , here 's a man in the house , here 's a thief in the house . When I came down the Prisoner was standing by the hatch , and the brasses were standing in the window : says Mrs. Powis , oh you rogue , you have stripped my house of almost every thing , and the Prisoner said do not be angry , Mrs. Powis , I have not hurt you much ; and afterwards he said do not be frightened , if you will let me go , I will send them to you , but she would not let him go , so he directed Downs and her where to go for the things , and they went and brought them back . Prisoner . I happened to be out of work two years , Mrs. Powis 's husband used to employ me ; when I went out of my house I thought no harm , I went to the window and called to Mrs. Powis to beg a few greens , and nobody answering , and being almost starved , I did not know what to do for some assistance , and that was the occasion of my doing it . I buried a child the Sunday before of the small pox . I had earned but eighteen pence for five months . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 302. Charles Billingsly , of St. Sepulchres , was indicted for stealing two silver spoons , value 15 s. the goods of Peter Holliday , June 15 . Peter Holliday . The 15th of this month I lost two silver spoons out of a back room joining to a yard ; the Prisoner carried one to Mr. Howston a silversmith in Fleet-Street , and the other to Mr. Mordaunt , a pawnbroker . The Prisoner was an errand boy to a young man who lodges in our own house , and took this opportunity ( as he confessed at Guild-Hall ) to go in at a sash window , and took them out of a corner cupboard . Mr. Howston . The Prisoner brought this piece of a spoon to me to sell , I asked him how he came by it , he said his master sent him to sell it . I told him I would send for his master to know the truth of it , and when I told him that he ran away , and had the impudence to send another boy with the other part of the spoon . Richard Mordaunt . The Prisoner brought this spoon to me , and said , he wanted 2 s. upon it . I asked him who sent him with it ; he said he brought it from one Green a cobler in the Old Bailey : said I , it is not usual for a cobler to have such a spoon as this , I will go to the person who owns it ; he said there was no occasion for that , he would go and fetch him ; he w ent away , but did not return to me : he has a mother who I believe is a chairwoman . Q . What age are you ? Billingsly . I am eight years old - My father is in the hospital . Guilty . [ Transportation .

Isaac Tolke . On the 18th of June coming through the Monument Yard , I saw a company of women , and asked what those people were there for ; they said they are the wives of those persons who are gone to Flanders ; while I was standing there I felt , as I thought , a hand at my breeches pocket * , I put my hand in this pocket and my handkerchief was gone ; the Prisoner was just by me , his right hand was under his apron , and his left hand in his bosom . I had a suspicion of him , took his apron up , and he dropped the handkerchief down upon his feet ; I took it up , took him by the arm , and carried him ( I think ) to the White Hart by Bishopsgate . I said if I could get a good character of him I would not prosecute him . I sent for his mother , and she said he was a vile boy , and behaved very undutifully , and had followed this practice these two years . * The Prosecutor found in the Prisoner 's left hand near three pounds that he had taken out of his breeches pocket , but out of tenderness to him he would not lay that in the indictment . Prisoner . My father and mother-in-law were always vile people to me , or I should not have been drove to this way of living . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 304.

These pewter plates were put out in Moorfields for sale by Mr. Hellier , and were taken away the 14th instant by the Prisoner . I thought she was a very honest woman till she went away , and then mistrusting something , I went after her , turned up her cloak , and she had them in her hand . Prisoner . He took them off the ground . Holder . I took them from under the cloak she has on now . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 305. Sarah Webster , of St. James Clerkenwell , was indicted for stealing a linen gown , value 6 s. the goods of Sarah Whitfield , June 5 . Sarah Whitfield . I hung my gown out to dry , and Sarah Trust told me the Prisoner had stole it . - I did not see her steal it , nor do I know that she stole it - I found it upon her . At first she refused to deliver it , but afterwards she did deliver it - I do n't know how she came by it - I know she had it because I saw it in her hand . Prisoner . The gown was blown down in the path , you did not take it from me , do n't forswear yourself ; I am a great way from home , I came from Shropshire . Mary Trust . I saw the Prisoner go by my door just by the White Lion at Islington . Seeing her whisk by , I thought she might have stole something ; I went to see if any of the things that hung upon the line were taken away , and I missed Sarah Whitfield 's gown . I went after her , brought her back , and found it in her apron . I did not take it from the Prisoner , Sarah Whitfield and her mistress both together took it from her . Prisoner . This woman has taken a false oath , for I did not take the gown indeed ; I had been making hay at the Angel for Mr. Winchester . The gown was lying in the path , and I took it up and sat a good while , and asked several people whether any body owned it . Acquitted . 306.

Ann Davis . On the Tuesday morning , May 22d , I found the cellar door open , and a little window , both the cloaks hung up in the kitchen , and the other things lay upon the dresser . To the best of my remembrance they were there on Monday night , between 8 and 9 o'clock ; we go to bed pretty early , because at this time of the year we get up at 3 or 4 o'clock to go a milking . I believe they heard somebody and that disturbed them , and so they went away . I opened the door , and there was a man coming by , I desired the man to let me light a candle . I said , God Almighty bless you , be so good as to go down with me , for I fastened the cellar door when I went to bed , and this little window , and they are broke open ; we searched , but there was no body . Elizabeth Causton my Carrier brought the Prisoner to me with my hat , apron , and handkerchief upon her ; and she said , I might take them . I said no , I will not take them , I will send for an Officer : she said she pawned one cloak to Mr. Stringer for 3 s. and the other to Mr . Chambers for 2 s. and the stockings for 15 d. Elizabeth Causton . I met the Prisoner by Clare-Market , and I saw my mistress 's hat , apron , and handkerchief upon her . I said Kate , How came you by those things , they are my mistress 's ? She said she bought them at the end of Monmouth-street , and gave 2 s. for them and a quartern of gin . I said , You must go along with me , and if you will not go with me by fair means , you shall by foul ; she wanted to get away from me , and untied her apron three times to get away , but I brought her to my mistress . George Stringer . The Prisoner brought this cloak to me to pawn , and I lent her 3 s. upon it ; she said she had been to see a man hang 'd in Hyde-Park . Prisoner . No ; shot in Hyde-Park .

My master asked the Prisoner after the things , and desired her if she had pawned them or sold them , to tell him where they were , that he might get them again , because the books were what my master valued , and she said she had pawned the two books to a person on Saffron-Hill . Elizabeth Pearson . The Prisoner had a cap and a pair of stockings of mine , which I found upon the cradle in my kitchen . Q . How do you know she took them out of the house ? Pearson . Because she told me so herself . Prisoner . Mistress , you are very well sensible I did not steal the things out of your house . Pearson . She did say so . Prisoner . The two books I own , as to the other things I know nothing of them . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 308 , 309. Edward Moody * , and Edward Wandon , otherwise Bannister , were indicted for stealing a silver tankard , value 5 l. the goods of John Bates , June 1 . * He was indicted by the name of Edward Moody , but said his name was Andrew Moody . John Bates . On Friday the first of June last I lost a silver tankard from the Red Cow in Smithfield , I advertised it in Saturday 's paper , and on Wednesday Bannister was stopped with part of it ; Bannister was in my house three times that day , and the last time called for half a pint of beer , and went away without paying for it , and the tankard was missing . Q . How long was it after they were gone before you missed the tankard ? Bates . I believe about three or four minutes . [ There were several pieces of silver produced , which appeared to belong to a tankard , but Mr. Bates would not swear that they were part of his tankard . ] Sarah Vane . I lived servant with Mr. Bates at the time the tankard was lost ; Bannister came on the Friday between seven and eight at night after the horse market was over . My master being up early was sat down in the kitchen to take a nap , my mistress was in the yard , and , I was at the door . There were three gentlemen who had three tankards of beer ; when they were going away there was some beer left in the tankard , and one of the gentlemen turned about to drink it . Bannister came in and asked if Robert Hall the drover was there ; said I , why do you ask for drovers at this time o'night ? you should have come at one or two o'clock . I fetched half a pint of beer for him , and he lighted his pipe . There was a woman came for a pint of beer in a hurry , I went down for it , and when I came up again Bannister was gone , and the tankard was gone . Q . How far did the woman come into the house ? Vane . There was no body in the tap room but Bannister , the woman did not come into the tap room , she sat on the bench at the outside of the door . I said to my mistress , Madam , have you taken the tankard off the table ? She said , No . The pipe which Bannister had just lighted lay upon the table , and he was gone without paying for his beer . On Tuesday this tankard was advertised , on Wednesday when my master was out there came in the constables with the two Prisoners : as to Moody I never saw him till he was apprehended , but as to Bannister , I am upon oath . When the constables came in they called for a tankard of beer , and I was dubious of drawing any beer in a silver tankard , because I had lost one on the Friday : when I saw Bannister I cried for joy to see him , and I said , You rogue , I believe you stole our tankard ; he said , You are a wicked creature to say so , for this silver I bought of a gentleman 's butler . I said , You are a rogue for stealing the tankard ; I have no other way of getting my living , and you would ruin me , for my master and mistress might think that I had stole it . Moody , when he was in custody , said , if we would go to some place , I forget where it was , we might find out the lid of the tankard . I would have gone after it , and if my master had gone with a search warrant I believe we should have found the bottom and the handle of the tankard . Q . ( to Bates . ) You say you saw Bannister in your house ? Bates . I ask pardon , I did not see him , I was only informed so by my servant . Prisoner Bannister . You hear her say there were three men in the house ; then how can she be sure I took the tankard ? Vane . I did say so , there were three gentlemen in the house ; I am upon my oath , but they went away , and left the tankard behind them . Prisoner . A n't please your honour before the Justice she said two men and a woman went out of the house together . Vane . I come here to do justice to God and man ; there was no body else in the tap room when I went to draw the beer for the gentlewoman but Bannister . I took too much remarks of him about his calling for half a pint of beer to be mistaken , for it is not usual for people on a market day to call for half a pint of beer , and smoke a pipe ; and as it has sell out I am very glad I did take so much notice of him . Elizabeth Sturt . I keep a house next door to the old Seven Stars in Rosemary Lane , and sell old clothes . On Monday the fourth of June both the two Prisoners came to my house . Moody came up to me , and asked if I had any such thing as a pair of damask shoes . He got on the left side of me , and asked if I did not buy silver ; he said he had got some bits to sell , and shewed them to me ; said I , young man , this is either the handle of a cup or a tankard . I asked him how he came by it , he said he found it in Rosemary Lane . I asked him how he came to think that I bought silver , when I sell old clothes : he said he was recommended to me ; I asked him who recommended me , he said a man in the Old Change . I said I did not care to buy it , for I was apt to think it was stole ; he said he did not know but it might be so , but he found it . When my husband came down , I told him such a person had been here , he said he was angry I did not call him , for I ought to have stopped him . The Wednesday following Bannister came and asked , whether I bought silver , and said he had some little bits to sell . I think he pulled out this paper . When I found it to be plate cut to pieces it surprised me . I believed there were some pieces that seemed to be stole . I went up to my husband and acquainted him with it ; he came down and examined the plate bit by bit , and asked him what he was ; he said he was an old clothes man , and bought it of a gentleman 's butler . My husband said he would stop it , Bannister said he could not blame any person for being careful , and that he was not afraid of any thing . My husband said , young man , stay and see the weight of your plate . We had not weights enough to weigh it at once , so we weighed an ounce and an half at a time , and when there were three ounces weighed , the Prisoner asked whether that was an ounce , I told him there were three ounces ; there were five ounces in all . The neighbours told us we should stop the thief as well as the silver . I sent my boy after him , the boy came back and told me he had watched him , and he was with the Prisoner Moody at one Buckmaster 's at the sign of the George by Prescot Street : they were brought to our shop , and we got a constable ; I said to Bannister I charge you with stealing the plate , and the other with being a confederate ; and before the Justice Bannister said he was an old clothes man , and bought it in the street for fifteen shillings . We looked at the advertisement , and found that Mr. Bates had lost a tankard . Samuel Handcock ( Headborough . ) Mr. Sturt came to me and desired me to go with him to stop two thieves . We went to Mr. Buckmaster 's , and there Sturt charged me with the two Prisoners . I carried them to Mr. Bates 's , and when the maid ( Sarah Vane ) saw them , she jumped , and was very joyful , she cried for joy ; and said to Bannister , You are the rogue that was in the house when the tankard was lost . Q . Did she fix upon him as the person as soon as he came into the room , or was it after she had talked with the constable ? Handcock . She jumped for joy , and said upon the first appearance of him that he was the person . Jonathan Sturt . I know nothing of any thing but only the stopping of the silver , I had it from Bannister , and he said he bought it of a gentleman 's butler . I said it was broke to pieces , so that I did not care to buy it till I knew how he came by it , and stopped it ; and when he came before the Justice , he said he bought it by chance in the street . Mr. Bates and Mr. Sturt who are both silversmiths by trade , said they took the pieces of silver to be part of a tankard . Prisoner Bannister . I went out early that morning with my bag , and I did buy it of a gentleman 's servant , but do not know who he was . Prisoner Moody . Bannister gave me the silver to sell for him , I carried it to Mrs. Sturt , and she would not buy it , so I carried it back to Bannister . The Wednesday following he desired I would take a walk with him , for he was going to sell something to fetch a little money . I knew him to be a hawker and dealer in goods , so I went along with him , and we were taken up . Moody acquitted , Edward Wandon otherwise Bannister Guilty . [ Transportation .

Richard Stratford . I live at the Baker and Basket in Hog Lane , on the 11th of April the sash window belonging to my chamber up one pair of stairs was thrown up - I found it open when I went to bed , and missed the things mentioned in the indictment . This put me into a great flustration . I heard no more of this affair till the 10th of May , and then I understood the Prisoner was taken up . When I saw him at the watch house at Norton Folgate , he acknowledged he had entered my house , and robbed me ; he said we should find all the goods at his house , and pulled out a key - I did not see him pull out the key and deliver it . Q . Did you go to his house and see any of your goods there ? Stratford . I went to his house in Tenter Alley , and saw my white quilt upon his own bed , took it off myself , and put the other things into it , and brought them away . Elizabeth Atkinson . The window was fast down at past eleven o'clock , I ask pardon , it was past ten o'clock , I mistook . Q . How came you to take notice of the window ? Atkinson . I went close by it , and looked at it , and saw it was fast down . Q . How is the window fastened ? Atkinson . There is an iron in the middle , and I fastened that myself - it is an iron that turns round . Q. to Stratford . What sort of a fastening is there to the window ? Stratford . There is a nut in the middle , it will turn , but it takes so little hold that it is of little or no use . Jury . Is it a screw to go in , or a hook to catch hold of the other sash ? Stratford . It is a hook . Q . Was there any thing that could latch it ? Stratford . No ; I believe not so as to secure the window . Q . How low was the sash down ? Atkinson . It was quite down . Q . You say it was about ten o'clock ? Atkinson . It might be half an hour after ten . Q . How do you know it was after ten o'clock ? Atkinson . My aunt said so . Q . Do you know it of your own knowledge ? Atkinson . No , Sir . Thomas Greenhill . On Thursday the 10th of May I heard an outcry of thieves , and went to Mr. Elkins the constable 's house , and there I saw the Prisoner ; I said it would be proper to search him there ; the constable desired me to search him , and searching him I found a key and some other things in his pocket belonging to another man . Quarendon , said I , here are some of the things , where are all the rest ? With that , Sir , taking the key out of his pocket ( he was loth to part with it ) I said , this is the key of a chest of drawers . Yes , said he , so it is . Then Mr. Stratford and the officer went to his house , and some time after I saw them come back with a great many things ; there was a white quilt , two gowns , and some caps ; the white quilt Mr. Stratford brought back himself , and I heard him say he took it off the Prisoner 's bed . Afterwards in searching the house , I took a shirt marked R. S. N. out of the washing tub wet ; his wife was there , I asked her how she came by that shirt ; she said she could not tell how her husband came by it , ( there were some caps and other things of Mr . Stratford 's . ) I asked the Prisoner how he committed the robbery ; he told me voluntarily he came over the back wall by the tenter ground into the yard , and seeing a window without a window shutter he got to the top of the shed , then went up to the window , pushed his finger against it , found it lifted up , and so pushed it up far enough to get in , and then got into the room , went to the chest of drawers , and pulled one of the drawers out , took the quilt off the bed , and put these things into it , which he took out of the drawers ; and out of the second or third drawers , I can not tell which ; he said he took about half the things , as much as he could carry away , and put them into a dyer 's bag , got out of the window again , dropped the bag down , and came to the shed ; he held the bag by the mouth , dropped it down , then jumped down himself , and made the best of his way through the next dyer 's yard , and so home . William Elkins ( constable . ) The Prisoner was at my house , and I thought proper to search him before he went away ; he hussled a watch out of his pocket , and was going to throw it out of the window , so I took care to secure him in the cage till morning . Thomas Page . About eleven o'clock at night I heard of the Prisoner 's being taken , Mr. Elkins the constable said I have not searched him yet ; when he talked of searching him , the Prisoner put his hand out and put a watch upon the shelf . He confessed he had broke into Mr. Stratford 's house , and had got the goods at his house ; when I came there I opened a drawer with a key which he had in his pocket , and took out some things which I have here sealed up . Q . Did you take the quilt away ? Page . No . Q . Did you see it there ? Page . I think this is the same . Q . ( to Stratford . ) Is that your quilt ? Stratford . Yes ; I lost it the 11th of April when my house was broke open . I took this yellow burdet gown out of the drawers at the Prisoner 's house ; I can not be positive to the linen ; these two gowns are my wife 's , which I found there . Thomas Greenhill . This cap I took out of the drawers , and this shirt out of the washing tub . Atkinson . This is Mrs. Stratford 's cap . Prisoner . I desire to call some witnesses to my character . Thomas Page . I have known the Prisoner a great many years ; he is a dyer , and served his time just by me . I know several masters of the trade that I keep company with , and they always gave him a good character . Another witness had known him from his infancy , that he always bore a good character whereever he lived and where-ever he worked , for whatever he heard of him , and his father and mother , always bore the best of characters . Edward Bonnet . He has worked with my master a great many years , and has come in at three o'clock in the morning , and never wronged man , woman , or child , in our house , I speak the truth . John Preston . I keep a publick house , he has used my house about three or four months , and I believe if his master could have been here , he would have appeared to his character ; he has entrusted him with more goods than he has wronged these people of . - Prior . I have known the young man about eight or nine years , his parents are very honest sober people ; he has worked with me several years , and I never knew any thing amiss of him - his general character was extraordinary good . Prisoner . I beg the favour of the honourable court ; I have got two small children , and a poor mother . Elizabeth Atkinson was called again , and asked , whether she was positive to it 's being half an hour after ten when she saw the window fast , but she said she could not tell any more as to the time of the night than her aunt told her ; but when her aunt came home she carried the cloak up , and hung it upon the back of the chair , and the sash was shut then . Richard Stratford . My wife did not come home that night till half an hour after ten .

Thomas Greenhill . The tenth of May hearing this person was taken up , I went to the watch-house , when I came there they talked of searching him , the Prisoner put his hand to his fob , and offered to lay something upon the edge of the window ; I caught hold of his hand as he was laying the watch down , and took the watch out of his hand : said I , Mr. Goodwin , I believe this is your watch , and Mr. Goodwin claimed it . In searching him I found this key , a pair of scarlet breeches were found upon him , this pair of silver knee-buckles I took from under the seat where he sat , and I fetched one pair of breeches from his house . He said he got in at the window , and went into the room where Mr. Goodwin lay , and took his clothes out ; he was up stairs when the gentleman who owns the other watch came into the room , and he sat upon the stairs till they were in bed , and till he heard them both snore , and when he thought they were asleep : he went into the room , and took the things away ; he said he tore the shalloon down off the horse in the dye-house , and that it was about one o'clock in the morning when he came out of the house .

On the thirty first of May I was in bed , and heard a great knocking at my door , I thought it had been some people from on board my vessel . My wife got up and saw James Martin go out at the door , and I heard somebody say I was robbed . I came down stairs , and they had got that young gentleman Mr. Martin [ the Prisoner , a boy about thirteen years of age . ] He immediately confessed the fact , and said , he would carry us where his confederates were , those that were along with him when he did it . He carried us to a house in the parish , which is called the blind woman 's house , where I went in , but found nobody ; I found nothing but two dead fowls , which they had stolen that night . I went up towards Rag Fair , and by the watch-house we took these three girls , and they carried us to Mr. Johnson 's house , where I found the things . Q . What did you find there ? Meriton . I found five waistcoats , & c. John Johnson [ the Prisoner . ] Take that man away , he is putting into his head what to say .

How do you know he stole them ? Lambert . It is by his own confession , I know no more than that , he said it in my master 's own parlour . I went along with them into Rag Fair , and stood at Johnson 's door , and received the things from the constable - These are my master 's goods , and what I received out of Johnson 's house . Mary Fell . I heard a cry of thieves , and saw the boy James Martin run along with a quilted petticoat , a waistcoat , and one green stocking : he ran down a turning , and threw the goods into the porch of the door , and the people crying out Stop Thief , I stopped him , and run him up against a door , and he threw me down into the channel , but Benjamin Amstead took him , then he begged Mr. Meriton to be favourable to him : he said he had been about half a year in that gang , and they sent him a thieving . John Badham . Captain Meriton sent to me in the morning , the boy was taken then ; he said he would tell us where the things were : we went into Swan Alley , but there were none of the things there . I told him he had deceived us , then he said he would go and show us where the things were , and he went with us to this Mr. Johnson 's . I knocked at the door , and they would not let us in - there was nobody appeared to open the door . I sent somebody round to see if there was not a back door . I looked in and saw a man and a woman go out of the room where they lay , one in his shirt , and the other in her shift , and they went towards the yard ; then some of my assistants got in at the back door , and let us in at the fore door , and gave the things to me , and I delivered them to the Captain 's maid , and she said here is something more than our due , that was a shirt unmade , and three plates . I went into the fore parlour , and Johnson was sitting with his coat on in the bed with a child by him . I asked him whether he was the master of the house , and he said he was not . John Johnson . Did I say so ? Badham . You would not own you was master of the house , and your wife run into the cellar . Q. Recollect what answer he gave you when you asked him whether he was the master of the house ? Badham . He said he was not : I asked him where the woman of the house was , and he said he could not tell . I was informed by a little boy that a woman was run out at the cellar window , and run down the street , and was gone into a house . I asked him what house she was gone into , and he said into the Hay-field house . I desired the man of the house that he would assist me , and told him I should be obliged to him if he would , and he went up with me into the garret , and we secured her . Q . When did you secure John Johnson ? Badham . We secured him at the same time . John Johnson . I desire he would ask the Prisoner Martin , whether he will not contradict him . Q . Is that the man that denied himself ? Badham . That is the very man . John Johnson . Did not I ask you what you wanted ? Badham . Yes , and I told you I wanted the master of the house .

He will say any thing , what signifies my asking questions when he denies every thing . Johnson ( to Badham ) You said you would hang me for the reward . Q . Did you ever declare that you would hang the Prisoner for the reward ? Badham . I never said any such thing . Johnson . You did in Ratcliff Highway , you did , indeed you did , indeed you did . William Carter . I went with the rest of the witnesses to the back door , and found these goods by the vault door , ( I do believe if I had not come as I did , they would have put them into the vault ) and I delivered every thing that is here to the Constable . After I had got these things , Mrs. Johnson came out of the cellar , I think with only one petticoat on , and she desired liberty to go down to put on her things , which I gave her , and somebody said she had made her escape out at the cellar door , and was gone into the hay field ; and I found her in that house , either in the room up 2 pair of stairs or in the garret , she struck at me , ( she can fight a battle , ) she struck at me like an ox , upon my foul , Sir . Q . Did you break open the door to get at her ? Carter . I shoved against the door and it opened . I do n't believe it was locked ; there were 4 or 5 stout fellows and a woman in bed together . They did not make any resistance , she was very rustical in the house , but when I got her out of the house she came along very quietly . Benjamin Amstead . I went with the Con stable to Johnson 's house , the Constable looked through the key hole , and bid us run round , the things were in the yard the outside of the house close to the vault door , and some of them had like to have been down in the vault . I run to the fore door and let them all in , I went into the fore room of the house , and Mr. Johnson was in bed with a young child . I was told that Mrs. Johnson was run out of the cellar window , and into the hay field house . I and the last witness went to the house , and told Mr. Bell the master of the house , that there was a woman run up who had received stolen goods . Then Mr. Bell said he would go up with us , we went up 3 pair of stairs and found her ; she was going to shove us out of the room , but when Mr. Bell came up she came quietly out of the room . Jane Johnson . I would ask him whether the goods were at the back door of my house , or the thoroughfare that goes into the alley ? Amstead . They were in the yard belonging to Johnson 's house close by the vault door . Jane Johnson . Was the door fast ? Amstead . No , it was wide open . John Johnson . There is a passage with about 50 houses in it , any person might put them in there , the Gentlemen of the Jury will consider this . Q . ( to Badham . ) When was it you first saw the Prisoner in his coat ? Badham . The minute I came in I saw him in bed with his coat on . John Johnson . Now Gentlemen of the Jury . I hope you will take notice of this , he said it was a man in his shirt that he saw first . Q . ( to Amstead . ) You say you let Badham in , had Johnson a coat on then or had he not ? Amstead . I can not say whether he had a coat on or no , but he was in bed . Carter . He sat in the bed with his coat on , and a child with him . John Johnson . There was a great mob , and I asked whether they had a right to come there , for I thought it was a press gang , and when I found what they were , I said if there 's any goods that belong to you take them . I said , ask the boy [ Martin ] whether I received the goods of him . Ask Martin whether I did not say I knew nothing of them ? James Martin . I am guilty of the fact , these girls know nothing at all of the matter . Bernard Bourne . Martin confessed that he robbed me that night of the goods that Mr. Meriton had brought to his house more than his own , and all the girls confessed that they received these goods from Martin , and had delivered them to Mr. Johnson , and had sold them to Johnson for 20 s. - Copeland and Monroe owned it , I remember particularly well , but I ca n't be positive to Esther Buck ; Martin confessed that he got over Capt . Meriton 's wall or pales , took the goods , and threw them over to these girls , and they carried them away . Prisoner Martin . I did give the goods to somebody , but who I can not tell , these are not the persons to be sure . Capt . Meriton being called again , said , that Copeland , Monroe and Buck , confessed that they carried some of these things to Johnson 's house . - The boy confessed it mighty publickly . Elizabeth Davis . I lodge in Johnson 's house , on the 30th of May there was a sailor , a relation of mine and a ship mate of his lay there that night , they had got a ticket for the Winchester , and their time was out . I got up at 4 o'clock in the morning to call them up to go away , for they were afraid of being pressed . We went out and left the back door open , and I went with them as far as Execution Dock ; there 's no lock at all upon it , and the lodgers all go through that way . John Johnson . Was I sick in bed or not ? Davis . He had been ailing some time , and had taken a sweat over night . Ann Plumberee . I lived in that house and let it to Johnson , he is a Smith by trade , and has done several jobbs for me , he made something for me between 2 and 3 months ago ; he did keep a Smith 's shop but does not now : he pays his rent very honestly ; when I lived in this house the cellar window was not secure , and now I believe that it is so closed up that a woman can not get out , there is no window or window shutter , there is only a great strong board , - it is impossible to get out at the window , there is no way to get out . Johnson . I make rasps for the Bakers , and I make them better than ordinary . I do n't sell them to the Ironmongers , because if I sell to them I must sell at a low price , but I only sell them to the Bakers , and then I have my price . Abraham Lockeridge . Johnson works at rasp making and file cutting , sometimes he works for me and sometimes for himself , and has within these two months . James Martin , Margaret Monroe , Esther Buck , Mary Copeland , guilty of the felony : John Johnson guilty of receiving the goods knowing them to be stolen . Jane Johnson acquitted .

May 2 . Christopher Plummer . The Prisoner is my brother-in-law , he came to see my wife , and took this Bible . I missed it the twentieth of May ; I made an enquiry after it , and found he had offered to pledge it to a pawnbroker in Old Street Road for 5 s. He s aid he would not take it in , because he thought it was stolen , and told me he believed he was gone to the Three Balls in Golden Lane . I went there , and asked him if he had taken in such a thing as that ; he said he believed he had , and gave me a description of the person that brought it . I got the Prisoner to go with me to the pawnbroker 's , and he said he could swear that was the person that brought it . Prisoner . Did I ever deny before the pawnbroker that I carried the book there ? Plummer . No ; the Prisoner said when he came opposite to the house he knew what I was going about , and said I should have the book in a fortnight 's time . Q . Do you think he took it with a design to steal it ? Plummer . I believe he would have returned it , and that he never did such a thing before , but was put to straits for a little money . Anthony Barnes . I live at the Three Blue Balls in Golden Lane , the Prisoner brought this book to me to pawn ( I believe it was earlier in May than the Prosecutor speaks of ) and asked 12 s. upon it , ( he did not offer to sell it ) he said it was a book he had a great value for , that he had a child lay dead , and had not money to bury it , and that was the reason of his bringing it . I offered him 5 s. upon it , he said that would not do , for he was very hard put to it , so out of compassion I lent him more than another would have done , I lent him seven shillings ; he did not pledge it in the name he was indicted by , but in the name of William Smith . Mr. Plummer came with him another time , and while they were in the shop , he asked the Prisoner for money , and the Prisoner said brother have patience with me , and I will pay you every farthing ; he said this when the Prosecutor was pulling him out of my shop by the collar - I did not think it was stole the Prisoner gave so good an accounts of himself , and told me where he lived . Prisoner . After my brother had been with me at Mr. Barnes 's , I went home , and stuck at my work till night , and was at work when my brother came and took me . Q . How came you to pawn this in the name of Smith ? Prisoner . I had borrowed this book of my sister several times to pawn , and did not care my brother should know it . I had a child lay dead then , and I did not care to beg the ground . I believe my sister would have been here if my brother would have let her come . Plummer . I did not hinder my wife from coming . William Ogden . I keep a publick house , I have known the Prisoner about a year ; when he came to live in the neighbourhood he was recommended by a friend , who said if he should want to borrow a shilling or two you may let him have it , which I have done , and he has paid me very honestly . He is a very industrious fellow ; I have heard that the Prosecutor should say that he would spare nothing to separate the Prisoner and his wife . John Buckland .

Was there any confession taken before the Justice ? Cater . There was something wrote , and they put their marks to it . Sarah Thomas . I happened to be coming along just by the Black Horse in Barbican , a few minutes before or a few minutes after eleven at night , I can not tell which ; I saw the woman [ Sarah Cox ] come up to him [ the Prosecutor ] and put the apron before his mouth . Q . When was this ? Thomas . The 27th of May . Q . What did she do then ? Thomas . She untied his handkerchief , and William Cox who stood behind , took the handkerchief of his shoulder , and run away with it . Q . By what light did you discern this ? Sarah Thomas . I discerned it by the light of the lamps . Q . Was there a lamp thereabouts ? Thomas . Yes there was . - I happened to be out that night a little longer than ordinary , and it being a clear night I stopped a little to see what they were doing , for I did not know but they might know the man . Prisoner William Cox . Ask the Prosecutor whether he ever saw me before ? Cater . I have seen him before , but I never saw him do any harm before . Q . Have you known the woman before ? Carter . Yes , and I know her to be a very vile jade . Thomas Dobbinson . I work for Mr. Willoughby a Press maker in Fore-street , the 11th of June Mr. Cater came to ask for Mr. Willoughby , and he said he had got an account of the persons who robbed him , and he said he heard they lived in Swan-alley , by the three Jolly Butchers . I told him I would go along with him and endeavour to take them , for they were generally out in the skittle ground . I knew it was a dangerous attempt , but I said I would be brought home myself if I did not take hold of them . I heard that William Cox had lately worked for a Hog Butcher . I went to the house of one Tidsell ( who I sent for to come hither ) I asked him whether Cox 's credit was good enough to borrow 20 s. and pay it at a shilling a week . I did this that they might not suspect what I came about . I did tell him there was an old woman that lent out money at a shilling a week that desired me to enquire , and the landlord went and fetched him ; he came and sat down , I said how do you do Cox ? I think there is too little for you , I had the pot in my hand and drank to him , ( some people said he looked a little white ) and desired the landlord to bring another . I catched him by the collar , and I had a little Joiner 's hatchet by my side , and I said if he stirred a step I would lay his head upon his shoulder ; Tidsell said , If I had known this , I would not have called him ; then Tidsell said to him , I told you what these whores would bring you to , but I did not think you had been so great a rogue as this ; Cox said he did not do it ; but he believed he knew who did , he said it was our Tom 's wife and some other persons . Then said Tidsell send and have them taken up , but he wanted to go and fetch them himself : I said , it is the custom in our country always to keep an egg in the nest till the hen has laid again , so Sarah Cox was sent for and brought in , when she came in shed - d his eyes and limbs if she would not hang him and all the gang of them ; after that she sell a swearing at me , she said she was present at the time of committing the robbery , and saw it done , but that it was William Cox and his wife , and one they call Country Moll who robbed Mr. Cater . She wanted to make herself an evidence , I went with them to Justice Hole by Clerkenwell church , and he said there was no occassion for her evidence , when there was evidence enough without it : I had William Cox 's wife brought before the Court , and she was acquitted before the Justice , because Mr. Cater said he did not see her to his knowledge . Prisoner Sarah Cox . Please to enquire into the character of that man , he has hung one person already , and he says he will hang us . Thomas Foot . I am a Headborough , the last Witness charged me with the Prisoners at an alehouse in Swan-alley for a robbery . I sent for the Prosecutor , and when the Prosecutor came he fixed upon them directly . Sarah Cox desired to go with the Prosecutor into another room ; I went into the back room with them , and Sarah Cox desired to be made an evidence as to this fact . Q . Did she mention how she-was concerned in it ? Foot . She mentioned a little of it then , but not so much as she did before the Justice ; the Prosecutor seems to give an account of their signing an examination , but I do n't know of any such thing . I heard her confess it before the Justice , and the man denied it all the time . Prisoner William Cox . I know nothing at all of the matter . Prisoner Sarah Cox . As to the Prosecutor I did meet him with a candle and candlestick , and he wanted to do some rude thing with me ; he is a very loose person , and makes it his business to pick up women in the night time . There 's a person in Court he took home with him who picked his pocket . Q . ( to Cater . ) Why did not you cry out , or go in search after them immediately ? Cater . I did cry out , I cried out stop thief , and they run up an alley . This woman [ Sarah Thomas ] being by , I asked her whether she knew them , and I went into Swan alley and enquired after them , and at last I found them out . Edward Berry . I have known William Cox a little boy , his character was always when he was little to be honest , and when he was a man to be honest . I am a Hog Butcher by trade , the Prisoner has worked some years with me , and when he worked with me I could trust him all over my house or with 500 l. - He worked with me last winter season . - I have something more to say to his character , he once brought a moidore to my wife which she had slipped off the table in telling some money , says he , Mistress , I have found a moidore , but if some people had found it , I should never have had it again . James Jackson . I am a Wheeler by trade , the Prisoner was born in the neighbourhood , I have known him from a little boy : he always had a good character ; the evidences against him are persons ( though I know none of them ) of very indifferent character ; I would trust the Prisoner at the bar with 100 l. sooner than I would the Prosecutor with 5 s. I am told the Prosecutor is a man very much given to drink , he had a wife and she left him because he was a nasty fellow , and took women home to bed with him . Berry . I have heard he is a lewd man , and goes out to pick up women in the night ; the evidence that wants to hang this woman , is one they call Bubby Sall . John Turner . I have known the Prisoner from a child , and know his father and mother , he worked for Mr. Berry many years , and I never heard him speak ill of him . I have heard of his picking up a moidore and bringing it to them . Mary Sanders . I am not come to speak to the character of either of the Prisoners ; I am come to speak to prove that the Prosecutor is a man , that makes it his practice to pick up common women . Q . What do you say of the woman , witness ? Sanders . I know her to be a common street walker ; and I know he was so drunk that night that he had a candle and candlestick in his hand , and did not know what he did with them . Joh n Berry . I have known the young man these ten or a dozen years , ever since he has been a child on and off , he has the character of a very honest young man ; he has worked with me this winter , and I have entrusted him with 2 or 300 l. value in my affairs , he has been where there has been silver cups and other plate , and he never took any of them . Richard Romaine . I have known William Cox 14 or 15 years , he has the character of a poor honest working fellow ; I have known Sarah Cox ever since she was first born , and I never knew any harm of her . - I know nothing of her character of late days . Hannah Barfield . I never heard he had the character of being given to thieving , he has been given to loose company . Makepeace Sheriff . Sarah Cox came of honest parents , I never knew any harm by her in my life . John Sheriff . I have known her parents these 20 years , and as for her I never knew any harm by her nor never heard any . Sarah Lake . I have known her a great many years , and was schoolfellow with her , she always was an honest girl from her bands ; she never wronged man , woman or child . Rebecca Canter . I knew her when she was a servant and lived at Mr. Poole 's a gunmaker in Shoe-Lane - about six years ago . I can not say I have heard any thing of her lately . Both Guilty Death . 324. Thomas Parker , was indicted for stealing two gowns , value 32 s. a velvet hood and pilgrim , value 10 s. three ells of silk , value 12 s. two tablecloths , value 6 s. a handkerchief , value 3 s. two ells of silk , value 18 d. one yard of holland , value 3 l. 6 d. a yard of cambrick , value 4 l. thirteen ells of linen , value 10 s. four ells of dowlas , five pair of sheets , & c . the goods of Mary Nicholls . Mary Nicholls . In April last I was sent to the Counter , and was there two days and two nights out of the spite of the clerk and the footman in the family where I was servant ; there was a woman in the Counter which the Prisoner kept , and she asked me if I wanted a man to go of my errands . I asked him if he would go round among my friends for me , and he said he would ( he said he was an attorney at law : ) I was sent from the Counter to Bridewell ; he went along with me , and asked me 5 s. for going to my friends , and he did not go to any of them but two ; then he said he was acquainted with the Sheriffs and Aldermen , and Mr. Lord Mayor , and under pretence of doing me great services he wanted money to treat them : he desired I would let him have the keys of my room ( I have a room in Houndsditch ) to get some money . I had but 14 s. 6 d. in my box , and I let him have the key , and bid him bring the money , a cap , a handkerchief , and an apron , and he brought me but 2 s. a cap , a handkerchief , and an apron ; he said he could find but 4 s. and he kept 2 s. for himself , for he said he wanted money . The matron of Bridewell asked me how I came to employ such a man , for he had not a good look , and bid me ask him ( when he came again ) for the keys . I asked him for the keys , and what he had done with a half guinea I had there ; he said he had not found the half guinea , but would bring me the keys . When I came to enquire after him , I found he was a runner at the Counter ; when I was discharged I went to my lodging , and missing my things , I was surprized . I went to the Counter to enquire after him , and they said they did not know any thing of him , but one of the debtors said he was a rogue and a villain . He absconded about six weeks , and I could not hear any thing of him but by the help of the matron and my friends coming to me I was discharged ; and one day as Mrs. Moyett and I were together , I saw Parker going up the Fleet Market , I took him by the shoulder , and said , Parker , how could you rob me ( there was one Mrs. Stevens who lives with him ) he trembled very much , and said , I know I have robbed you - he said he had robbed me ; we went into a publick house , and I got a constable , and had him before my Lord Mayor , and he owned then that he had wronged me , that he had pawned the things , and would make me easy in three or four days , but he had a fortnight 's time given him , and did not do it then . He sent Mr. Goodall to me , and he gave me a note on the behalf of Parker , that he would get my things in a week 's time , or he would produce two guineas ; but I was informed the note was good for nothing . I got a search warrant , and found all the goods mentioned in the indictment at four pawnbrokers , one in Clare Market , one in Shoe Lane , one in Barbican , and the other in Houndsditch . Frances Moyett . I was along with Mrs. Nicholls at the Ditch Side when she met with Parker ( he gave himself the title of a Solicitor , but I found he was only a runner at the Counter ) I took hold of him myself : and she took hold of him , and saw him sence in this manner - he wanted to hold her hands down , he trembled very much , and said , I have wronged her it is true , but I will make her any satisfaction whatsoever for her things . I kept hold of his arm , and would not let him go till I got into a house . We went into a house the corner of Fleet Lane , and he sat very quietly ; Mrs. Nicholls said she would have me go and fetch a constable , I told her she had better go herself : while she was gone , I said to him , I wonder how you could use this woman so barbarously when she was in prison I told him there were five pair of sheets , and a great many other things ; he said , I am sorry for it , I will make her any satisfaction ; where is she gone ? I believe she is gone to fetch a constable : I said at first I did not know , and afterwards I said , I did not know but she might . I asked him how much he thought they might be worth ; he said he believed he had pawned them for about 40 s. Prisoner . I said if I had injured her I would make her satisfaction . Moyett . He said he had wronged her , and that he would make her satisfaction for her things . Lawrence Ambrose . Mrs. Nicholls was under my care at Bridewell , I saw her deliver the keys to the Prisoner , and she desired him to fetch her a cap , a handkerchief , and some money - I can not tell how much money she ordered him to bring , but afterwards she told me it was fifteen shillings . Q . Did you deliver these keys to the Prisoner for any other purpose than to fetch these things and the money ? Nicholls . For no other use . John Baxter . I live at Mrs. Harvey 's in Houndsditch , the Prisoner came to our shop about the 19th of April , and brought a gown , a napkin , and a tablecloth ; he said he came from Mrs. Hickman over the way , and wanted 20 s. upon them : he said , I believe you may know the things , for Mrs. Hickman has brought them before , as she had done . I told him I would not lend so much upon them , I would lend him but 16 s. he went and brought another gown , and then I lent him 20 s. Q . Did you give him any orders or leave to pawn them ? Nicholls . I never did indeed , he pretended he had a note from me to do it , but it was not my note . Francis Gore . I live in Barbican , the Prisoner pledged three ells of silk , a napkin , and a piece of new cloth at my house . Abraham Bibby . I live in Stanhope Street , Clare Market , I took in these from the Prisoner , the mob and velvet hood were pawned by the Prisoner and another , the pilgrim and cap were pawned by the Prisoner himself the next day . Judith Fletcher . The Prisoner said before my Lord Mayor that he had wronged Mrs. Nicholls , and would make her all the satisfaction he could . Prisoner . In April last I went accidentally , or rather unfortunately into the Poultry Counter , the Prisoner was committed there on suspicion of robbing her master . I had some business with relation to the clearing some insolvent debtors , which was the reason of my going there . I was recommended to her to assist her , and went about her business ( she acknowledged she had been guilty of a great many errors . ) When she was removed from the Poultry Counter , I went and attended her in Bridewell : she desired I would take her keys , but I sent another man for them ; she delivered the keys to him , and he delivered them to me . She ordered me to pawn some things for her , and bid me say I came from Mrs. Hickman : and I do say , I do allow , I said I came from Mrs. Hickman , for I had her order so to do . John Baxter . You did say so . Prisoner . She said do this for me , but do not tell Mrs. Hickman , for she is this , and that , and t'other . She asked me for money several times , and I gave it her : I asked her for money several times , and she had none ; whatever she asked me for she had . Jury . What sum did you give her ? Prisoner . Whenever she asked me I gave her ; I have two witnesses in the Poultry Counter , one of them can come , and has been here ; the other is in upon a writ de Capias Excommunicando . Thomas Edwards . I have known the Prisoner upwards of ten years , he has been concerned for some eminent brewers as a clerk , about four or five years ago , one in Holborn , another at Knightsbridge , & c. and in all those places I never heard any thing of this kind laid to his charge - he has since that done business for attornies as a writer . William Goodall . I have known the Prisoner these five or six years , for I am concerned as an agent for his brother , who is a reputable attorney in the country ; and since the Prisoner has been out of business , I have employed him as a scribe , he writes a good hand , though he was not bred an attorney . I heard he was sent to the Counter on suspicion of a robbery ; I enquired into it , and went to the Prosecutrix , and said , if he has robbed you , I will not be concerned in it , but I do expect his brother in town and then he will make you satisfaction . She said she was in upon suspicion of a robbery herself , and while she was there nobody would come to her ; she said she had entrusted him with her keys to go to her lodging and take some things out : says I , you must have a very good opinion of a man to suffer him to do that ; she said he owned he had taken her things , and pawned them to the value of 40 s. or upwards . I asked whether it was without her privity ( because he said she had given him power to go and take such things in order to raise money ) and she said she had given him the keys to take some things to pledge to raise money , but I can not say what particular things she mentioned . Q . Did she say she gave him directions to take particular things , or was it a general order ? Goodall . I understood it was a general order to take what he thought proper , but I can not say positively it was . The Prosecutrix came to me a second time at King 's coffee-house in Fleet Street , and said , I do not want to hurt the man , but unless you will give me two guineas I am advised to prosecute him for Felony : there was a Jew along with her at that time . Edwards . I was with her before my Lord Mayor , and she never pretended it was a Felony . Q. I ask you upon your oath whether you ever said to Mr. Goodall , that you gave the Prisoner your keys to take such things as he thought proper to pawn ? Is that true , or not ? Nicholls . I never had any such thought , nor never said any thing like it . Q . He says you owned you gave the Prisoner your keys to pawn either some particular goods , or else in general to pawn goods for your use ? Nicholls . I never said any such word , or any thing like it , as I am in the presence of God . Q . Did you say it was all one to you , if he would give you two guineas or your goods , or else you would prosecute the man ? Nicholls . I said I was very much imposed upon , and I would go by my Lord Mayor 's directions . Q . Did he offer any note to you ? Nicholls . He did offer me a note , and I was told that the person who offered me the note wanted to impose upon me . Thomas Lamley . I having some knowledge of Parker , went with him to Grocer 's Hall , he had three or four hearings before he was committed , because the Prosecutrix did only desire security for her goods , or to have her goods again . She offered to take that gentleman 's note [ Mr. Goodall 's ] and said she did not desire to prosecute him . Q . Did not she say he had robbed her ? Lamley . No , she did not say any such thing . Q . Did not she say something to this effect ? Lamley . She said , if I can get security for my money or goods , I will not prosecute him . Q . Did she acknowledge she gave him the key to take the goods to raise money ? Lamley . She said she gave him the key to take the goods to raise money as he thought proper , - She said this as we were walking backwards and forwards in the hall . Nicholls . I never spoke to the man in my life . Lamley . She talked with me an hour together . Sarah Hickman . I live in Houndsditch , Nicholls had a room in my house . Q . What have you to say about Nicholls goods ? Hickman . What would you please to have me say ? I do n't know what I came for . Prisoner . Speak the truth . Hickman . I am to speak the truth between . Parker and Nicholls ; she had a lodger one John Brown who was a fellow servant with her in Bishopsgate-street , and when he left his master he came there , and came with all her keys . Q . Did Parker ever come alone ? Hickman . The first time he came with her keys he came alone , and John Brown saw him , he was in the room when he brought them . - I ca n't say how many times he came , I believe it was 4 times , it might be 5 times . Prisoner . Did not you say to me , Take care what you do , or you will bring yourself into a secret ? Hickman . I bid you be very careful what you did . You brought the keys , and came for things , and said you had her order for it . Q . Did he carry them out publickly before your face ? Hickman . He carried out 2 gowns , a napkin and a table cloth publickly at noon day . Judith Fletcher . I was present with Mr. Goodall , and Mrs. Nicholls at the Feathers-Tavern in Cheapside , and at King 's coffee-house in Fleet-street , I was there all the time , and heard every word that passed between them . Q. I ask you whether she said she gave him the keys to raise money by any particular goods , or by the things in general ? Fletcher . She gave him no such orders , she said she gave him the keys to fetch a cap , an apron , and a handkerchief . Q . Did she mention any money that he was to bring ? Fletcher . She said there were four shillings and half a guinea in her box ; I do n't know that she bid him bring any money . Q . Did she say she was indifferent about prosecuting the man , or if he did not make it up , she would make a felony of it ? Fletcher . No indeed she did not , indeed she is very much wronged I must own . Guilty . [ Branding . See summary . ] 325. Sarah Probert , otherwise Mason , of St . Paul 's Covent-Garden , was indicted for stealing 7 silver tea spoons , value 3 s. 6 d. five towels , value 1 s. two table cloths , value 1 s. a cotton gown , value 2 s. a counterpane , value 1 s. a pair of shoes , value 6 d. and 2 muslin handkerchiefs , value 6 d. the goods of William Vaughan , April 1 . William Vaughan . On the 30th of March I went down to Deptford to enter on board a ship in the service of the East-India company , and I was informed at Deptford the 2d of April that my house was broke open . When I came home - I live in Hart-street by Covent-Garden Playhouse , I found there had been some strain to take out a bar of the kitchen window . I missed a quantity of coloured shirts , I ca n't tell how many , seven tea spoons and other things , some are mine and some my mother 's . I had a suspicion of one Richard Probert , who I heard had entered into the army , and lived with a woman at one Lewis White 's in Thieving-lane , ( whether it was his wife or no I could not tell ) I enquired for him by the name of Probert and described him , and they said there was one Mason lodged there that belonged to the army . I heard he had entered into the Duke 's regiment , went to the Corporal of the guard at St. James 's , and found he was sick in the Infirmary . I had liberty to go up and found him lying in a miserable state of health . I heard there was a woman came to him who called herself his sister , and she was to be there the next day . I waited to see her , and found she was the Prisoner ; I enquired at Lewis White 's whether they had seen any calico shirts , and in particular , the counterpane : they informed me where the washerwoman lived , I went to her , and she said she had washed such a thing ; 't is an India Pallampore . Upon this information I got a warrant to search Mr. Smith 's a Chandler 's shop in opposition [ opposite ] to the Blue Boar's-head in Denmark-court . I searched the house and found 5 towels and a table cloth . I got a warrant to apprehend the Prisoner ; the Wednesday following I saw her at Mr. Townsend 's she said there her husband ( Mr. Probert ) as she called him had sold 2 table cloths , some towels and the counterpane to this Mrs. Smith for 13 s. or 13 s. 6 d and she said she had sold the silver spoons herself . Prisoner . Pray Sir , did I sell the things ? Vaughan . There is evidence that you sold them . Smith . I bought these things of her and her husband as she calls him , and she said she was offered 11 s. for them at the Star Tavern in the Strand ; that her mother bought that counterpane of an upholsterer and gave a guinea for it . I gave them 13 s. for them , and I heard no more of them till Mr. Vaughan came with a warrant . Elizabeth Bathew . The Prisoner kept a house in Vine Court , I know she had a great many good things ; she offered these things to Mrs. Wood at the Star Tavern , and she would give but 11 s. for them , and Mrs. Smith gave her 13 s. - her husband was with her at that time . I have known Mrs. Mason two years , I lodged in her house , and take her to be a very honest person ; they then went as man and wife . Prisoner . Did not you give the money into my husband 's own hand ? Smith . I laid the money down upon the table , but can not tell whether he or she took it . Mary Margerum . I have known the Prisoner three years and an half , she was a lodger in my house before she was married . I have trusted her fifty times in my house ; I have a 100 l. worth of plate in the house - my husband is a poulterer in Leadenhall Market . Mary Hone . I have known her ever since she was born , and - Butler from eight years of age , and gave her the character of a sober modest young woman . Acquitted . 326 . + Lydia ADLER * , late wife of John Adler , was indicted for that she not having the fear of God before her eyes , & c. on the 11th day of May , in the 17th year of his Majesty 's reign , with force and arms in the Parish of St. Sepulchres , in the Ward of Farringdon within , in and upon John Adler her husband , in the peace of God , & c. feloniously , traiterously , wilfully , and of her malice aforethought did make an assault , and him the said John upon the ground , feloniously , traiterously , wilfully , and of her malice aforethought , did cast and throw , and he the said John then and there lying , in and upon the groin of him the said John Adler her husband , divers times feloniously , traiterously , wilfully and of her malice aforethought did kick and stamp , giving to the said John Adler upon the groin of him the said John , one mortal bruise , of which said mortal bruise the said John Adler from the said 11th day of May to the 23d day of the same month did languish , on which said 23d day of May , & c. in the Parish of St. Bartholomew , the Great , & c. the said John Adler of the said mortal bruise did die , and therefore the Jurors say that she the said Lydia Adler , him the said John Adler , in manner and form aforesaid , feloniously , traiterously , wilfully , and of her malice aforethought did kill and murder . * She was indicted last September Sessions by the name of Lydia Millin , otherwise Adler , for breaking and entering the dwelling house of John Adler the younger , and stealing some wearing apparel , the property of Priscilla Adler , and a silver watch , & c. the property of John Adler , the elder , [ the Deceased ] and acquitted . See Page 260 , Trial 485 . She was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's inquest for manslaughter . Hannah Adler . The deceased was my husband 's father , on the 13th of May he came to see us , and I went home with him - He lived in Bartholomew-close ; he told me this wicked woman the Prisoner at the bar was the woman that murdered him . Q . When did he tell you so ? Hannah Adler . This was done the 11th of May , and he told me so the 13th . Q . Upon what occasion did he tell you this ? Adler . He said she had thrown him cross the bed and bedstead , and kneeled upon him and he was forced to go away from her . Q . Was he naked then ? Adler . Yes , he was just going into his bed . Q . How long after that did he die ? Adler . He lived 12 days afterwards . Q . Had he been out after this ? Adler . Yes , he had been out . Benjamin Barton . He came to my house on Friday May 11 , he had a handkerchief about his head that was bloody ; and he says to me , Barton , have you ever a spare bed in your house ? I told him no . I knew the Prisoner to be a very turbulent woman , and I refused him a lodging : says he , This eternal fiend will be the death of me , for she has stamped upon my private parts . I never saw him any more till the Tuesday following ( this was on the Friday ) at his own home in 3 Fox-court in Bartholomew-close . On Monday he sent a note to me by Mr. Godman 's [ the Surgeon ] servant to pay him a guinea , ( and Mr. Godman 's receipt should be my discharge , ) before Mr. Godman would meddle with him . On Tuesday I saw him again , for I visited him every her day during the time of his languishing , and very often he said , I wish Mr. Barton you would be a good as to get a warrant to secure this woman , for she will be the death of me : And two hours before he died he asked me if I had got a warrant so the Prisoner . Q . When was this ? Barton . It was the 23d of May . Q . What did he desire then ? Barton . He said if I had not got a warrant then , he desired I would see her brought to justice , and I said I would if it lay in my power ; then I went home , and in about two hours his daughter came and told me her father was dead . I was with him much about 12 o'clock , and he was dead before two . Q . ( to Adler . ) What time did your father die ? Adler . I think to the best of my knowledge between 12 and one in the afternoon : about 10 o'clock he said , I am a dead man , and this lady [ the Prisoner ] has killed me . I made answer again and purged him and said , father , who was it gave you this wound that turned to the mortification ? He said , 'My dear child , she is the person that did it , and I hope you will bring her to justice . I was very ill in sitting up so many nights and days , and he said , Dear child , I hope you will live to see her brought to justice , for she is the person that murdered me ; he died about ten minutes after he said these words . Thomas Godman . I attended the deceased on the 14th of May , and the first word that the deceased said to me when I came into the room was , This wicked woman has murdered me . I desired to search him with regard to his complaint ; he told me she had hurt him in his private parts , when I came to examine him , I found he had a rupture of the gut in the scrotum - the gut had fallen down into the scrotum - our term for it is Hernia Intestinalis . I found upon examining that this was not recent . Q . What do you mean by examining ? Godman . Both feeling and looking . Q . What do you mean by recent ? Godman . Fresh contracted ; for his rupture had been some years , but he had received a contusion upon the groin , which had occasioned a stagnation of the contents of the gut in the scrotum , of which notwithstanding all I applied to relieve him he died - I believe about the 23d of May : I opened him after the Coroner had taken his inquest , and found the gut to be mortified , which was the occasion of his death . Q . By what occasion was that mortified ? Godman . I take it to be by the bruise upon that part of the gut which comes down into the scrotum . Q . Was the contusion recent ? Godman . That was recent , but the rupture had been of a long continuance . Q . Suppose this had happened to a found man , what damage do you think this would have done him ? Godman . It would not have hurt him , for some labour 20 years under this complaint ? Q . Was it a great bruise ? Godman . It was sufficient to occassion a stagnation of the contents , which occasioned the complaint ; - his general cry was , the wicked woman had killed him , but who he meant I ca n't tell , for he never mentioned any name to me . Prisoner . Mr. Godman may be a very good Surgeon , he is Surgeon of St. Luke 's Parish , but I never knew a Surgeon open a man without 3 or 4 Surgeons with him , for he had this ailment a great many years ; if he lays any thing against me I will suffer the law . My husband was two months and was not able to put his shoes or stockings on . Godman . I have mentioned it to the Court good woman that this was an old complaint . Prisoner . My husband loved women , he had got 2 wives besides me ; he had a crew he lived with in St. Giles 's , and one of them gave me a slap of the face ; I asked her what she did here ? and she said he was her husband and struck me , and said she could cut me in three pieces , and she tore my cap off my head ; he went to pull this creature off me , and fell against something , and this creature fell upon him , he fell backwards , and she is a very great weight ; and he got such a disorder by this that he could not put on his shoes or stockings ; he has not had an hour 's health since I have had him , which is 4 years and an half . He was very bad to be sure , but I never lifted up hand or foot against him . I was advised to carry him to the hospital , but that creature [ Hannah Adler ] knocked me down with a hair broom , and took him to her house . Joseph Steele . I have known the Prisoner about nine or ten years . Mr. Adler was acquainted with another woman in Golden-lane that he had two children by ; he was always a loving man to his wives at first , and when they came to be a little expensive to him , they used to fight like dog and cat : he had another wife between her and that gentlewoman [ the Prisoner . ] I ask pardon it flurries me , I am not used to these things ; I am not used to come into a Court : he had a housekeeper who was pretty lusty , and she used to beat him , and when he put her off , he took to this ; she was as pretty a modest behaved creature as could be , and continued so for a long time ; he was as fond of this at first as he was of the others , but then money growing thin he wanted her to work , and allowed her but little for it , and would buy stale things for 2 d. which if they were good would be worth 8 d. I believe they trumped up stories against her , for I carried her twice to New Prison , ( I am an officer of the Parish and kept a publick house in the neighbourhood ) the last warrant I had , the Justice did not believe she was guilty , and discharged her . Q . You seem to say , that this woman did really beat him ? Steele . I believe she was like other women , that when he struck her , she struck him again . Q . Did you ever see her strike ? Steele Yes , I have ; upon my oath I have ; I have seen them fight up and down . Prisoner Do n't you know he took me up for a robbery ? Steele . I can not say anything to that ; I know he tried his first wife , this is the 4th wife , and they were all served in the same kind . Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 327. Mary Gibson , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing 2 silver spoons , value 8 s. one pair of silver sugar tongs , value 5 s. a silver tea strainer , value 2 s. the goods of Thomas Hurnell , May 2 .

I was called out to serve a customer , in the mean time she took the tea spoons , & c. and went out at a back yard , and I never heard any more of her till she was brought to me ; she had sold some at a Silversmith 's , and owned she took one of the spoons . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 328.

The Prosecutor not appearing she was acquitted . 329 , 330. John Strech , Eleanor Strech , of St. Mary Whitechapel , were indicted for stealing two sheets , value 3 s. the goods of Elizabeth Fosset , June 10 . Elizabeth Fosset . I lost a pair of sheets , but I ca n't say they took them . I met them in the street one day , and charged them with taking them and took them up ; my passion overcame my reason , or I should not have done it . Acquitted . 331 . + Francis Perry , of St. Mary le Bon , was indicted for the murder of Thomas Perry , by assaulting him , and casting and throwing him upon the ground , and upon the ground divers times , feloniously , voluntarily , and of his malice aforethought , with both his hands and feet , striking and kicking him on the belly , breast , stomach , sides and groin , and thereby giving him several mortal wounds and bruises , on the 22d day of May , in the 17th year of his Majesty 's reign , of which he languished , and languishing did Live from the said 22d day of May , to the 29th of the same month , and that he on the said 29th of May , in the Parish of St. George Hanover-square , did die . He was a second time indicted on the Corner 's inquest , for feloniously slaying the said Thomas Perry . Elizabeth Perry . I do n't know the Prisoner , - my son who is dead wanted 7 days of 14 years of age , his father is a Taylor , but he has left me , the boy was brought up to the Taylor 's business , and was very useful to me in it : This was done the 22d of May last . I had given him leave to go out to play , when he came home he sat down at the bottom of the stairs . I went to him and said , Tommy , why do n't you come up and eat some supper ? He was very dull . I had some bacon and greens but he did not eat any of them , only a bit of bread : he did not say any thing of his being hurt that night ; the next morning between 7 and 8 o'clock I thought I saw some disorder in my child , and asked him what was the matter with him ; I said there was some disorder more than ordinary . Says he , Frank Perry has given me a kick on the belly and hurt me very much ; he showed it me , and there was the print of the toe of a shoe upon his flesh . Q . Was there any great bruise ? Elizabeth Perry . Yes . Q . Was it much swelled ? Elizabeth Perry . Not much . I said let us go to an apothecary and surgeon , may be you have hurt some of your guts ; he said , do n't go to day , mother , for to morrow I may be better , but he grew worse and worse . In the mean time I did what I could , I sent for an apothecary , and he ordered him some things . On Monday I sent for Dr. Middleton the Surgeon . Q . Was the bruise inward or outward ? Elizabeth Perry . There was not much to be seen outwardly . On Monday Dr. Middleton 's man came to bleed him , and on Tuesday he came again . Pray mother , says my boy , order me a sleeping draught ; the doctor 's man said there is some disorder in your child more than I care to mention , and afterwards he said I will not deceive you , he is exceeding bad , I would advise you to send him to the Infirmary , he went into the Infirmary , and every thing he took before you would imagine it was got into the stomach , came up again as green as grass . Q . How long was he at the Infirmary ? Elizabeth Perry . I believe about two hours , and then he died . Q . Was he opened ? Elizabeth Perry . Yes . Q . Was you by when he was opened ? Elizabeth Perry . They would not let me . Q . You say when the boy came home he said he had a kick from this Francis Perry . Did he talk of it afterwards ? Elizabeth Perry . I said to my child I will get a warrant to take this boy up , for you will certainly die ; and I asked him how it happened ; he said young Bailey and he had been in the fields a birds nesting , and when they came back they came into the brick field , and there was Francis Perry [ the Prisoner ] in that field : said young Bailey I know of a robin 's nest , and Frank Perry said that Bailey had shewed my child the robin 's nest before , and my child said he had not . My child said , Francis Perry took up a three shilling ball ( it was a tennis ball , I do not know what it cost ) and bit me on the elbow , and that made me saint ; then he bit me on the side and on the back , and hurt me very much ; but I am tired now , says he , and can not tell you any more : that was the last he said about it . Mr. Riddle , Surgeon . I opened the body of the deceased on the Thursday after he had been dead two days . Q . What condition did you find him in ? Riddle . I did not find the least sign of any external violence , neither was there any upon the muscles ; in the inside I found a very great inflammation of the intestines , but sometimes this is occasioned by a fever . Q . Can you take upon you to say that this was occasioned by any external bruises ? Riddle . I can not say that , it may be occasioned by other things , such as playing at cricket , jumping , or drinking water when they are warm . Q . Was there any mortification ? Riddle . There was something of it , the intestines looked a little livid ; knowing what had happened made me more careful to examine the outward part . Q . Can you say that his death was occasioned by the blow or kicks that the deceased received ? Riddle . I can not say so . Q . Have you any reason to think so ? Riddle . I can not say I have . Acquitted of both indictments . The Jury found that the deceased died a natural death . 332 . + Elizabeth Turner , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a silver watch , value 3 l. the goods of Samuel Tuck , privately from his person , May 15 . Samuel Tuck . On the 15th of May I was walking in Covent Garden Piazzas , and was enticed by a couple of young women to go to a house in St. Giles 's about ten o'clock at night . As soon as I got into the room the two women and I had a glass of gin ; when we had drank that the two women fell upon me , and took my silver buckles out of my shoes . Q . Was the Prisoner one of the two women ? Tuck . I saw her in the house , but she was not one of the two women . When they had taken my buckles they left me in the room by myself , then I went out of the house with a design to go home about my business ; as soon as I came out the Prisoner at the bar followed me , came unawares behind me , and tore my watch out by main force through the waistband of my breeches . Q . Why did not you prevent her doing it ? Tuck . Because I was by myself , and she came unawares upon me . I turned round , and saw the watch in her hand , and she went into the house she came out of . Q . Did you feel the watch taken out of your pocket ? Tuck . I felt the watch going . I turned round and saw it in her hand . Q . So you did not secure her ? Tuck . No ; I did not . Q . Was you at that time perfectly sober ? Tuck . I was sober when I came into their company , I had been drinking a dram or two with them - I was not so much out of my senses , but I could remember very well what I did . Q . Did you drink any thing before you went there ? Tuck . I drank one dram before . Prisoner . He had a warrant against the other two women . Tuck . I had a warrant to take the two women ; I at first learned the name of one of them , but the name of the other I could not learn . Q . What did you charge the other women with ? Did you charge them with taking your watch as well as your buckles ? Tuck . No ; only with taking the buckles ; the Prisoner 's name was in the warrant , but it was only for taking the watch . Q . Why did you secure the Prisoner then ? Tuck . I secured her the next day . Jury . Why did not you secure her then , you might have run after her and taken her ? Tuck . I was afraid of having my brains knocked out . Jury . You do n't say there were any men in the house ; did you see any men there ? Tuck . No ; I did not see any . Jury . It is not probable that these people should take his buckles out of his shoes , and leave a watch in his pocket . Prisoner . The Prosecutor came th e next day to search for a watch ; I stood with my back to the window , he said he saw nobody that he knew ; the Constable asked him whether he could swear to any body , at last he laid his hand upon my shoulder , and said , you are the woman that robbed me of my watch ; and Mr . Waters made answer , and said , I must take charge of you , and I went down to the watch-house with them . I never set eyes on him before , and I did not know him again when I saw him . Mary Durham . I have known the Prisoner five or six years , and know her to be a hard working person . I live in the same house where she did , the Prisoner was fast asleep by the fire side when the Prosecutor came in with the two women . I heard him cry he was robbed , and I saw one of those creatures run through the coach yard about eight or nine doors lower , one ran after her , and cried , Bess Smith , why do n't you come back , ( they are both of them by New-Goal now . ) I will take my oath to both of them by their faces , and to one of them by her shape , she is crooked . Q . You say you were in the house after these women run out ; did you continue in the house yourself ? Durham . No ; I went out and sat upon the steps . Q . Did the Prisoner go out ? Durham . No ; she was sitting by the fire side . Q . Should you have seen her go out , if she had gone out ? Durham . Yes . Q . How long did you stay there ? Durham . I went up to bed three or four minutes after . Q . If you went up to bed so soon , how do you know she did not go out ? Durham . I did not hear her stir afterwards , if she did go out it was unknown to me . Mary Smith . I was servant to Mrs. Bradley in St. Giles 's in the Fields . I saw two creatures with the Prosecutor , one of them held him fast against a wall , and Elizabeth Smith run away with his watch - Mary Mascall and Elizabeth Smith were the two persons ; Mary Mascall said , by G - d I have got his buckles , and the other is run away with his watch ; Smith took the watch , I saw the chain of it in her hand . Q . Was it a silver or a gold watch ? Mary Smith . It was a silver watch , a middle sized watch . Ann Spratt . I keep a publick house in Church Lane , I sat up that night for a man and his wife who lodged in my house : I heard some tongues talking , and went to the door , and there was one Elizabeth Smith on the left hand of this young man [ the Prosecutor . ] Q . Can you remember him ? Spratt . Yes ; I can - he stood with his back to me . Q . What discourse was there ? Spratt . The discourse was this ; he said let me feel ; says Betty Smith , I thought you would lie here all night , and Smith said let me feel ; she spoke in a vulgar way , and she said he should feel . He unbuttoned his breeches , and she took hold of his fob , and gave something a twitch , and whipped it away , but I can not tell what it was . Mascall came in again , the watchman then went past eleven , and the Prosecutor said , are you the watchman ? and he said , yes . Says he , I am robbed , and he mentioned a watch for one thing , and either buttons or buckles , I can not tell which ; and I heard no more of it till Wednesday morning when the house was searched . Hannah Battle . I happened to be standing at the door , and the last witness said that a young man and one of the women were gone up stairs ; when the Constable came next day , he said to the Prosecutor , do you know any thing of that young woman [ the Prisoner ? ] and he said , no . Said one of the gentlemen , you ought to be well horsewhipped . There are two women in the New Goal who he swore took his watch . Tuck . I swore to the other two women who are in custody for taking my buckles . Henry Townley . I had no warrant to take the Prisoner , I had a warrant to take two other women . Q . Was Samuel Tuck with you ? Townley . Yes . Q . Do you remember what Tuck said ? Did he charge you with the Prisoner ? Townley . When he first saw her , he said she was not the woman - I am upon my oath , Sir . Q . Was you afterwards present when he said she was the woman ? Townley . Yes - I was in the watch-house , the Prosecutor came in about one o'clock in the morning in liquor , and said he had been robbed . Mr . Waters was the constable of the night , and I am his headborough ; three or four of us went that night into that street , and he did not know which was the house . He came at three or four o'clock that afternoon , and brought this warrant , and swore to three persons robbing him of his watch and buckles . I went to search for these women , ( they lodged there then ) and there was the Prisoner and three more women in the house ; when I came into the ground room , I said to the Prosecutor , is ever an one of these women one of the persons that robbed you ? Look and take notice of them ; and he said never an one of those women robbed him . The Prisoner showed us into every room of the house , and when the Prosecutor was coming out of the house , he turned about , and said , this is the woman , and I will swear it . John Waters . The night after Mr. Townley had the warrant , was my watch night ; I saw Mr. Townley in the afternoon , says he , it is your watch night , there is a young fellow has lost his watch , and I can not find the people ; said he , will you take the warrant from me , and I said I would ; but the young man came to the watch house and I gave Mr. Townley the warrant again , but he desired me to take a walk with him there ; when I came there I saw the Prisoner , I had known her six or seven years ; said I , Betty Turner , I have a suspicion of two people in your house having committed a robbery , and I am come to search ( there were some other women there ) the Prisoner took a candle and lighted us , and the Prosecutor said none of those persons were the women that robbed him ; and as he was coming out of the house , he turned back again , and said , that is the woman , and I will swear to her .

Upon that this Buck and I forget a will , he bought a will that was half printed , and I filled it up . Buck went as the chief creditor . Council . Come to this particular fact . Sherlock . This brings it down . After I had filled it up I put a mark and a seal to it , and I put a mark for Thomas Callaway , but that will was not proved ; for I went to the ticket office , and they told me there was no such man in the ship . I dropped it for that time , in about two months time , the Prisoner at the bar came to my house at Tower-ditch , and told me the Hector was arrived at Deptford , and said , if I would go down with him we should find out the right name : the next day being Sunday about 9 o'clock in the morning we went to Deptford , and found out where some of the Hector 's ship 's company were ; the Prisoner asked the Carpenter 's mate whether there was not one Thomas Callaway on board ? He answered there was no such man , he said there was one Bob Callaway , who was killed by the strap of the viol * block giving way ; the Carpenter 's mate enquired why he asked ? He said he had a letter from one of Callaway 's friends in the Isle of Man ; then the Prisoner told me Robert is the right name . I went on shore to dine , and said to one of the ship 's company , Brother , had not you one Bob Callaway on board , who died by the viol block giving way ? He said yes , poor young fellow , I am sorry for him . I asked him if he had made a will ? He said he made none to his knowledge , for he was killed suddenly . Then we came to the Prisoner 's house in Ratcliff Highway and consulted about forging the will of Robert Callaway ; the next morning , the Prisoner at the bar , and I , met in Bridges-street , Covent Garden , at one Tease 's + , and one Mary Ogden was there , who I thought was a proper person to do the business . I asked her whether she would personate the sister of a young fellow that was dead ; I would not put her for the wife , because he was not above 21 years of age when he died ; and he had been out a great while : she said she would if she was well paid for it ; I asked her what she would have ? She said she would have penny for penny . * Viol , when a three stroud rope is bound fast with nippers to the cable , and brought to the jeer capstan for the better weighing of the anchor . + Sherlock was evidence against Jane Tease , who was tried last sessions for uttering and publishing a forged will . Page 133 , Trial 276 . Q . Did the Prisoner hear this ? Sherlock . He might if he would , for he was just by ; then I went to the Prisoner , and told him she would do it , and what she would have . He said , I do n't know how that is , it is too much ; then the Prisoner said to her , young woman , you shall be very well paid for your trouble if you do it . - He said it was only telling a lie , and she would be very well paid for it , it was only a form . Then I asked Tease for a pen and ink , and he went and got it ; I had a couple of blank wills in my pocket , I asked for a private place , and he bid me go up stairs . - I went up , and left Buck and the Prisoner at the bar . I filled up the will of Robert Callaway to his sister Mary Callaway ; Buck signed the name of one of the witnesses , and I the other , and the Prisoner at the bar made the mark for Callaway 's name . - I think he made 5 or 6 scratches for his mark , and I wrote these words , the mark of Robert Callaway . The Prisoner writes a very bad hand - we never let any body see any thing done , but those who are concerned in the forgery . Q . Do you know the names of the witnesses ? Sherlock . I ca n't say positively , 't is 2 years ago . Q . Are they fictitious names ? Sherlock . They are fictitious names I 'm sure ; I always put fictitious names . [ The will was produced and shewn to him . ] Sherlock . These are the names , Henry Dashwood is my writing , and George Mauldin is Buck 's writing , then we dried it by the fun , and sent for a pot of beer , the Prisoner at the bar drank some of the beer and spurted it upon the will to make it look old , and put it upon the window to dry ; he said it would be dry in half an hour , and he would have sent the woman to prove it . I said I was sure it would not do that night , so we agreed to let it alone till next day - the Prisoner did not write any of the letters , he did nothing but make the mark . I kept the will till the next day - to the best of my knowledge I kept the will , I am almost sure I did ; the next day the Prisoner and I went to the house again to meet Mary Ogden as we had appointed : I read the will to her , and then we came with the Prisoner to St. Paul 's Church-yard . Q . Was the Prisoner by when the will was read to her ? Sherlock . He was standing close by me , the Prisoner was to shew her the way to Mr. Lee the Proctor 's , and I was to go to the Sangree house in St. Paul 's Church-yard to wait ; he did shew her the way to Mr. Lee 's , and came back to me ; in about an hour or three quarters of an hour , Mary Ogden returned to us , and told us the probate of that will would be ready about 11 o'clock the next morning ; we all three appointed to meet at the Horseshoe in Blowbladder-street the next day , and we went there about that time , and Mary Ogden went to the Commons ( as they told me ) and brought the probate to me ; she said she had paid for the probate , and that it cost a matter of 31 s. because it was for 2 sister . Then we all three went to the Navy-Office , the Prisoner and Mary Ogden went in , and I staid without , and in a very little time they brought out the ticket ; then we went to Mr. Henshaw 's office on Tower-Hill , and they wanted to sell it , but there being some deflection [ defect ] in the will , it would not pass there - for the will bore date several months before he went on board the Hector . Council . It appears by the books of the Navy that he went on board the Hector in 1739 , and the will is dated in 1738 . Q . Was you told that it was wrong , or did you know it yourself ? Sherlock . The Prisoner shewed it me , and asked me how I could make such blunders , and I saw plainly afterwards that it was wrong when I compared it with the ticket . Mr. Henshaw sent for the Purser of the ship , and asked if he knew Callaway 's sister ? He said he did not know his sister , but knew nothing to the contrary but that it was his will . Mr. Henshaw said if she would go to the Pay-Office in Broad-street , where the ship was paying , and get the first payment , he would discount the remainder ; ( that was what the Prisoner and Ogden said to me when they came out ) then the Prisoner cursed and swore at me , and Ogden said if she did not get the money for her trouble , she would go to the office where she got the ticket and deliver it up again . The Prisoner took the probate and I took the ticket , because I remember we did not care to trust one another ; we appointed to meet next day at Tower-ditch , this Mary Ogden came and a young man with her . I went to the Prisoner 's house , and said , what have you a mind to do with this ticket ? He said , never fear , we will get it sold ; the Prisoner and I went directly and had a bill of sale made , I think it was to one Mr. Tarver by Ratcliff-cross , we went to Mr. Tarver 's house and shewed him the ticket , and got a note on Alderman Hankey , we got the money mostly in Portugal gold . Council . How much money did you receive ? Sherlock . I know there was above 20 l. it might be 25 or 26 l. for I know we divided above 20 l. and he took 4 s. or 4 s. 6 d. in the pound . - Mr. Tarver gave Gulleland a draught for 20 l. and upwards . Q . Did Tarver give you a draught on Alderman Hankey ? Sherlock . Yes , Mr. Tarver would do such a thing for the Prisoner at any time , he would have trusted him with 50 l. Q . Where was the bill of sale made ? Sherlock . It was made at the office in Brichin-lane ; the Prisoner and I went directly to Towerditch where we had left Mary Ogden and the young man waiting for us , and went to the seven Stars or fourteen stars in Rosemary-lane , I ca n't tell which ( for there are both those signs there ) then the Prisoner gave her the ticket for her to put her name to it , and she said if you do n't pay me for it , you shall not have it any more ; then he held the money in one hand and the probate in the other , and he said ( holding out two moidores and a guinea to her ) here is the money for you . Q . Did she sign it before she made this demand or after ? Sherlock . It was after ; she made her mark and then the Prisoner gave her two moidores and a guinea , and the Prisoner took the paper to himself and she made a great noise because she had not more ; that Money was to be between her and a young fellow that used to wait on her . Then the Prisoner and I went to Goodman's-fields to settle our affairs , and there we had 2 chickens and asparagus , and two bottles of wine . I asked the Prisoner how it was to be ordered ? He said he had had a great deal of trouble about it , and advanced the money ; so I had 4 or 5 moidores for my share , and we paid 8 s. for the reckoning ; after that he said , there is an Attorney at law by Moorfields who has got a bond of mine and he threatens to run me to an execution , if you will go along with me , I will go and pay him the money ; I went with him into Moorfields , and he paid the Attorney four or five moidores before my face , and the Attorney delivered up the bond . - It was somewhere by Moorfields , I ca n't tell the name of the place . Prisoner 's Council . What account was the bond upon ? Sherlock . I do n't know what account , he said he was threatened with an execution about it - this was all in May 1742 - there were two or three people came to me to New Prison to ask me to make a deflection in my evidence - one Hart who is a publican in St. Catharine 's came to me and said , if I would make a deflection in my evidence , he would give me 12 guineas , and would get it out of Gulleland , and he said if I did not find the bill , I should have the money directly . Prisoner 's Council . You say you had two chickens and asparagus , and two bottles of wine , and all for 8 s - if the rest of your account is as true as this , 't is a very good one . Sherlock . I think it was the Green Man that we went to , to the best of my knowledge the reckoning came to 8 or 9 s. Council . I suppose you had some strong beer too ? Sherlock . I do n't know but we might . [ Then the will was read as it is set forth in the indictment . ] Mary Ogden sworn . Ogden . I have known him about two years . Between Easter and Whitsontide I think , about two years ago , the Prisoner and this rogue [ pointing to Sherlock ] told me I was to do something for them , and it was only to tell a lie ; they gave me a letter , and I was to go with a will . Council - Who gave you the letter ? Ogden . Gulleland did . Council . What was the letter given you for ? Ogden . I was to give the letter to somebody in Doctor 's Commons . Gulleland went with me and shewed me the door , and I had a will , which I gave to the gentleman . Council . Should you know it again if you were to see it ? Ogden . I do n't know that I should know it , I never saw one before , and I hope I never shall again : after they had done it , they spurted beer upon it . Council . Who did ? Ogden . Gulleland did . Council . Did you go to Mr. Lee 's ? Ogden . Not the same day it was filled up . Gulleland wanted to go the same day , but this fellow Sherlock would not let him ; and they said if I was asked whether I was the sister of Robert Callaway , I was to say , yes ; and if they asked whether my name was Mary Callaway , to say , yes . Council . Where is Mr. Lee 's house ? Ogden . It is by a tavern , the sign of a head in the Commons , and then he gave me the will . Council . Who gave you the will ? Ogden . The Prisoner , he knows it , he will not deny it , I know he will not tell a lie . Council . What sort of a man is Mr. Lee ? Ogden . I believe he was a man , a little round shoulder 'd . Council . Where did you go then ? Ogden . He took me to a handsom man , he had a gown upon him like you , a very fresh handsom man , and he handed me a book , I do n't know what he said , and he gave that gentleman a shilling . I left Mr. Lee after I had delivered him the will ; he gave his service to Mr. Gulleland , and bid me come the next morning about eleven of the clock ; then I went to these honest gentlemen [ pointing to Sherlock and Gulleland ] where they ordered me to come to them , and I met them the next day in Blowbladder Street , and afterwards I went with this Sherlock to a coffee-house in St. Paul 's Church Yard , and Gulleland and I went to Mr. Lee 's and got the Administration , and paid for it : Mr. Gulleland , did not you pay for it ? he will not deny it . Council . To whom was the probate of the will given ? Ogden . It was given to Mr. Gulleland , he knows it was ; then we went to the Ticket Office , and he sent a little boy in to see if Mr. Purvis the ticket clerk was in the way . [ It was not you , Sir , it was another little man , speaking to Mr . Bentham . ] I went into the ticket office , and they staid till I got the ticket , then I went out and gave it Gulleland , for they would not trust me with it , and you never saw such work , fighting and quarrelling , and Sherlock said to the Prisoner , You shall have the sheep skin , and the Prisoner said , You shall have the other . Did not you say so ? [ speaking to Sherlock ] the parchment he called the sheep skin . Council . Did not you ask Gulleland for some money ? Ogden . Not that night , it was late before we parted , I believe it was six o'clock before we got the ticket ; they were didling and dadling backward and forward till it was too late to go to Mr. Henshaw 's . Gulleland said in the Ticket Office , Mrs. Callaway , the Hector will be paid to morrow ; I thought he was going to call me by my own name . The next morning we went to Mr. Henshaw 's , and he sent for the purser of the ship , and asked him if he knew Robert Callaway ; says he , here 's a ticket , it mentions him as belonging to the Hector : the purser said he knew the man right well . Mr. Henshaw asked him if he had made any other will , he said he did not know that he had . Mr. Henshaw said , well Mrs. Callaway , go to the Pay Office in Broad Street , and get what money is due to you , and then come to me . I said to Gulleland , how can I go there to face so many men as the whole ship 's crew ? I said I would not do it , I would carry it to the gentleman that gave it me , and really I did not think there had been any harm in it till I handled the book , and they know I would not do such a wicked thing if I had known it : they were afraid I should go to Mr. Henshaw and discover it ; one was worth money , and did not care to be exposed ; and as to the other , he did not care to go to a goal , but he is not afraid of scandal , for I believe he is pretty good proof against that : as I had done it , I thought I might as well have something as nothing , and I said , I would not sign it till I had the money . Q . Did you sign it before you had the money ? Ogden . I do n't know whether I signed it before I had the money or not . Q . How much money had you ? Ogden . I had two moidores and a guinea . Q . Who proposed this to you ? Ogden . Both of them , but Sherlock spirited me most to it . Q . Who proposed it first to you ? Ogden . Really I ca n't tell ; Gulleland said that Callaway belonged to the Isle of Man . Q . Did you say nothing about what money you was to have ? Ogden . I said I would have as much as they , and I thought it reasonable I should , I thought I ought to have as much for my lie , as they had for their 's , as we were all liars alike . Q . Did not you know that you took an oath ? Ogden . The Court was sitting and there was a great noise , I could not tell what I did . Q . Can you read ? Ogden . Yes , I can read print . Q . Do you know one Mcdonald a Taylor ? Ogden . I do n't know such a man in the world . Q . Nor you never was at Gulleland 's house ? Ogden . I never was in his house in my life time . Mr. Lee sworn . Council . Do you know the Prisoner at the bar ? Lee . Yes . Q . Had you any letter from him in 1742 ? Lee . I received a letter from him in 1742 , signed James Gulleland - I never saw him write . Mr. Parr sworn . [ The letter was shewn to him . ] Q . Do you believe that to be Gulleland 's hand writing ? Parr . I do believe it is ; this is some of his writing [ Mr. Parr compared it with another letter of Gulleland 's ] I have seen him write - Nothing is more like . Q . Do you know that woman ? Lee . I ca n't pretend to say I know her face . - I do n't know who took out the probate - I do n't know who paid for it . Mr. Gulleland 's letter to Mr. Lee was produced and read , wherein he desires him to make a strict search in both offices , whether there is any probate taken out , or any caveat entered against the will of Robert Callaway , and if there 's nothing done in it to let the bearer prove the will , and he would pay him when it is done . George Purvis sworn . Council . Do you know any thing of delivering a ticket to the executrix of Robert Callaway ? Purvis . If I see the ticket I shall know if I delivered it - this is of my delivering , it is for 22 l. 12 s. 9 d. Council . Is it not possible for you to recollect the person you gave it to ? Purvis . I do n't say 't is never possible to remember a person 's face , but 't is v ery improbable . William Tarver sworn . Council . Do you know the Prisoner ? Tarver . Yes . Q . Is he any relation of yours ? Tarver . No , he is something related to my wife . Q . The witness said that you would trust the Prisoner with a large sum of money ? Tarver . I have trusted him with money . Q . Do you know any thing of selling a ticket for the payment of the wages owing to Robert Callaway on board the Hector ? Tarver . Yes , I remember it very well . Q . Do you know how much the ticket was for ? Tarver . Yes , I received 22 l. 12 s. 6 d. upon it . Q . Did you give the Prisoner a draught for this money on Alderman Hankey ? Tarver . No , I gave him the money , I gave him no draught : I did upon another ticket give him a draught , but I did not give him a draught for this ; that which I gave him the draught for , was upon a ticket relating to a trial last Sessions . I gave him then 25 l. 10 s. Q . Who did you pay the money to ? Tarver . To Gulleland , I saw nobody else . - I paid Gulleland 20 l. 11 s. for it , the ticket was made out for 22 l. 12 s. 9 d. Sherlock . Ask him , my Lord , whether I ca n't tell any remarkable place in his house , and what pictures are there . Prisoner 's Council . You will hardly see your own picture hanged . Prisoner 's Council . When you paid the money for the ticket , was the bill of sale filled up ? Tarver . The bill of sale and every thing was ready . Q . Had you any thing besides the ticket delivered to you when you paid the money ? Tarver . I had all the papers , and the parchment too ? Council . What ticket was that you gave him the 25 l. 10 s. upon ? Tarver . It was the assignment of Donald Mcdonald 's ticket , June 2d , from Margaret Mcdonald . Q . How long have you known Gulleland ? Tarver . I have known him ten or eleven years ; I used to buy checks and other things of him for transportation . Q . What is his character ? Tarver . I never heard any harm of him in my life . Prisoner 's Council . Do you think he would forge a will ? Tarver . I should think he was the most unlikely person in the world to do it . Q . Have you had any other will from Gulleland ? Tarver . Yes . Q . Was that a forged will ? Tarver . It is not right ; I was half concerned in that , he had one half and I had the other . Q . Have not you had another that was bad ? Tarver . I ca n't say I had not . Prisoner 's Council . Do you think he would be such a fool as to trust himself in the hands of an Irish woman , and Sherlock the witness ? Tarver . He came up from Portsmouth last sessions , I told him how things were ; and I said , sure you are not such a villain as to put these things upon me , because I have faith in you ? He said he knew no more of it than I did . Prisoner 's Council . I shall make no observations , we have contradicted Sherlock by what the last witness says , and the woman has positively swore she never was at Gulleland 's house , and we can prove that she has . Ogden . I never was there in my life . Prisoner 's Defence . Samuel Little sworn . Prisoner 's Council . Did you ever see that woman at Gulleland 's house ? Little . I ca n't be positive , I think I have . Ogden . Look in my face and see whether you know me , and see your own conscience . Q . Are you sure you have seen her there ? Little . Yes , she is the woman - I never did see her but once - The beginning of May was two years , Mr. Gulleland and I , and one Farrel were drinking a pot of beer , and this woman came in , says she , is Mr. Gulleland at home ? Mr. Gulleland said yes , my name is James Gulleland ; says she Mr. Mcdonald the Taylor recommended me to you about his brother 's will and powers , and desires you would let him have some money upon it . Says Gulleland , I do n't know you , I will give you no money unless Mr. Mcdonald my Taylor comes ; she went away and said , she would bring Mr. Mcdonald , and she brought him in a little time . Ogden . He says he never saw me but once . Little . Mr. Mcdonald desired he would let him have money upon it ; Mr. Gulleland said he would write to his Proctor , and that was all one as if he had money upon it , and he sent Odgen with the letter . I was playing at skittles at Gulleland 's , and she came back again and said , I have been at your Proctor 's and left the letter , and he and she talked together in the ground . Q . When was this conversation ? Little . Last May was twelve months * . * Here he contradicts what he said before , and she said May was two years . Q . How often have you seen her at Mr. Gulleland 's ? Little . Never but once . Council . Did she go for the probate and bring it back the same day ? Little . Yes . Council . That is enough . John Gulleland sworn . Council . Are you any relation to the Prisoner ? John Gulleland . I may be some far relation , I am of the name - I ca n't tell what relation I am to him , if I am any . Q . Did you ever see that woman that gave evidence at Gulleland 's house ? [ The witness paused a considerable time . ] Q. Recollect and be sure of what you say . John Gulleland . About two years ago , I can not say I can be positive to this woman . Q . Do you remember any woman 's coming with one Mr. Mcdonald ? John Gulleland . Yes . Q . Was Samuel Little there at that time ? John Gulleland . He was ; there was a great society at Mr. Gulleland 's door looking at something , this woman [ Ogden ] came and said , which of you gentlemen is Mr. Gulleland ? I being of the name , said , Madam , my name is Gulleland : says she , Sir , I am recommended to you by Mr. Mcdonald the taylor to have your assistance to get my brother 's wages . Madam , said I , I deal in no such thing , you must apply to the landlord of the house , he is the person you want , and she went in to the Prisoner , but I did not hear what she said first , for I did not go in directly ; when I went in he was reading a paper . Council . Was he reading a parchment ? Gulleland . He was reading a parchment , it was a will - I was not certain whether it was a will , or not . Council . You say it was a parchment ? Gulleland . I do n't know whether it was or not . Mr. Gulleland wrote a letter , and sent her , as I suppose , to the Commons ; she was gone about three hours or longer , and came back , and said , she had done the business she went about , and that the other might be done to morrow or next day - I live in London - I work at the King 's Brewhouse - I am a miller - I have known Gulleland a great many years - I have known Little half a year , or thereabouts . Council . You say you never saw Little till about half a year ago ? John Gulleland . No , Sir , Little is a ballast heaver - I ca n't tell what countryman he is - I am a north of Ireland man . Mr. Ogan . I have known Gulleland six or seven years , he is a check weaver by trade ; there was a warrant granted against him in March by Sir Thomas de Veil . I saw him about three weeks or a month ago , he was then carried before him by one Dovey a constable - he surrendered himself voluntarily to the Commissioners of the Navy , and they ordered him to be taken into custody . Q . Did not he abscond ? Mr. Ogan . I do n't know for what reason he should abscond - he was always reckoned a man of a fair character . Prisoner 's Council . You have given Gulleland a good character ; what do you know of the character of Sherlock ? but I will not ask you his character , for he has characterised himself already . - What occasion have you for a character against Sherlock , who would be guilty of murder , facrilege , or any thing ? Mr. Ryan ( Solicitor to the Commissioners of the Navy . ) There was a warrant granted by Sir Thomas de Veil , but they could not take him . About a month after , Gulleland came to my chambers , and said , his character was aspersed by Sherlock , and he had a mind to clear his character to the Commissioners of the Navy : the Commissioners said I should speak to Sherlock , and draw up any deposition he had against him . On Monday he came again , ( Sherlock had sent me some accounts relating to Mcdonnah 's will ) The Commissioners were not willing to take him up upon the evidence of Sherlock alone . They examined the books , and found they agreed with the ticket , which he could not know without he had been concerned : they took time to consider of it , and then resolved to prosecute Gulleland . Justice Richards . I have known the Prisoner about ten years , I never knew him charged with any crime or vice . His character is as good both in publick and private life as any ones ; he is a sober , honest , modest man ; I was surprized when I heard of this ; I never was more deceived in the character of a man in my life if he is guilty of what is laid to his charge - he was a check weaver when first I knew him , but since he kept an alehouse , sold slops , and bought tickets - he has been a very good husband and a father , and kind to his wife 's friends that wanted . Mr. Shepphard . I have known the Prisoner ever since the year 1738 . I always knew him to be just in his dealings ; I should not have thought such a thing as this by any thing that I ever saw of him . Mr. Baker likewise appeared to his character . Robert Price said he always bore the character of an honest man . Thomas Allen said he was a man of a very good character , and had brought him some money from Portsmouth lately . Austin Allen . I have known him eight or nine years , his character is that of a just , honest , and upright man . I have lived in Whitechappel parish fifteen years - 't is his character in the parish , and all the parishes about it . Cook . He bears a very good character , I have dealt with him , he is an honest worthy man as far as ever I saw . William Snook . I have known him seven or eight years , I would have trusted him with an hundred pounds worth of goods ; he is the last person I should think of to be guilty of any such thing . William Cholmley . He kept ten or twelve looms at work for me several years , and was a pains taking man - I do n't think he would be guilty of any thing that is bad . James Masters and Tobias Corneck gave him the character of an honest man . Thomas Little . I have known the Prisoner sixteen or seventeen years , I knew him before he came here - in the country of Downe in the kingdom of Ireland . Guilty , Death . He was a second time indicted for forging and counterfeiting the aforesaid will of Robert Callaway . He was a third time indicted for forging and counterfeiting the will of James Mcdonnah , late a mariner on board his Majesty 's ship the Strafford , June 1st , in the 16th year of his Majesty 's reign , in the parish of St. James 's Clerkenwell . There was another count in this indictment for uttering and publishing the will of James Mcdonnah knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited ; but as he was convicted upon the first indictment , he was not tried upon these . 336 . + Ann Brogdon , wife of Samuel Brogdon , late of London , labourer , was indicted for that she after the 24th day of June , 1736 , to wit , on the 15th day of November , in the 17th year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord George the Second , & c. at London , that is to say , in the Parish of St. Bennet 's Paul 's Wharf , & c. falsely and feloniously did utter and publish as true , a certain false , forged , and counterfeited paper writing , or instrument , partly printed and partly written , sealed , purporting to be the last will and testament of John Frail , deceased , and to have been signed , sealed , published , and declared , by the said John Frail , as and for his last will and testament : in which said paper writing , or instrument , partly printed , and partly written , are contained the words and abbreviations of words following ; that is to say , ' In the name of God , Amen . I John Frail , mariner , ' now belonging to the good Ship Sarah , being ' of sound and disposing mind and memory , ' do make and ordain this my last will and testament . ' First and principally I commend my soul ' into the hand of Almighty God , & c. and my ' body to the earth or sea as it shall please God , and ' as for such worldly estate and effects which I shall ' be possessed of or entitled unto at the time of my ' decease , I give and bequeath the same as followeth , ' That is to say , unto my dear beloved Sarah ' Frail , my just and lawful wife all such wages as ' shall become dew to me on board of the Sarah or ' other any ship in which I shall be employed ; and ' I do hereby nominate , constitute , and appoint , the ' said Sarah Frail , executrix of this my last will ' and testament , and I do give and bequeath to ' my said executrix , all the rest , and residue of ' my estate whatsoever , both real and personal , ' hereby revoking and making void all other and ' former wills by me heretofore made , and do declare ' this to be my last will and testament . In witness ' whereof I have hereunto set my hand and ' seal , this 10th day of May , in the year of our ' Lord one thousand seven hundred and therty ' eight , and in the 11th year of the reign , & c. ' Signed , sealed , published , and ' declared by the said John ' Frail , in the presence of us ' who have hereunto subscribed ' our names as witnesses , in ' the presence of the said ' Testator , ' John Frail . ' John Proctor , ' Thomas Mitchell . ' With intent to defraud our said Lord the King , she the said Ann Brogdon , at the time of uttering and publishing the same , knowing it to be false , forged and counterfeited , against the form of the statute in such case made and provided , and against the peace of the King , his crown and dignity . James Aickin . - I belong to the first regiment of guards , on the 15th of November last the Prisoner was at Sarah Lowther 's room in King 's Head Court in Shoe-Lane . I saw Robert Rochead forge the will , he filled up the blanks , and put the name of John Frail at the bottom ; he wrote the name of Thomas Mitchell , and I wrote the name of John Proctor ; it was done in the presence of the Prisoner , and Rochead gave it her to dry by the fire : she agreed to go and administer to it in the name of Sarah Frail . Rochead desired her to say , her husband belonged to a merchantman called the Sarah , and died on board the Garland man of war ( she was to go to Mr. Major the Proctor ) and he said , Ann will be a new face to him ; I went with her to Mr. Major 's and staid till she came out . On the 17th in the evening I went with her to get the probate , she brought it and a receipt for the money , signed Henry Major ; to the best of my remembrance it was 6 s. I went with her to the ticket office to get the ticket , the Gentleman desired her to shew him the administration , and asked her name , she said Sarah Frail , then said he , young woman your case is very frail , for a mess-mate of your husband 's has received the wages some time ago . She pretended to be under a great concern and came home , so he said never mind it , for I have got another mark ( that is a cant word we have for a forged will ) and Sall ( meaning Sarah Lowther ) shall go and do it to morrow ; Sarah Lowther perfected that , and was convicted of it last Sessions * . * See Page 135 . Trial 277. Lewis Morgan produced the will , which he proved to be taken out of the Bishop of London 's office , which was read , and is as in the indictment . Q . Is this the first time you have been concerned in any thing of this kind ? Aickin . No - I have been concerned 2 or 3 times - I believe 4 or 5 is the most - I am sure I have not six times . Q . Ca n't you get up to six ? Aickin . That is not a fair question - I never was evidence but once , and that was against Sarah Lowther , who was convicted last Sessions . Henry Major . This will was proved at my office , but I ca n't remember the person that came with it . The jurat is my clerk 's writing , he got her sworn before Dr. Jenner . Daniel King . I am Clerk to Mr. Major , on the 15th of November a person came with this will , and said she was the widow and sole executrix named in it . I wrote the jurat and had the person sworn - I think I have seen the Prisoner , but I ca n't take upon me to say that she is the person that proved this will . Margaret Dillingham , Mary Munton , Winifred Prentice , and William Moore , knew her some years ( she was born in the County of Tipperary ) and gave her a good character . She was a 2d time indicted for uttering and publishing a forged and counterfeited will of James Gleeson , otherwise Glasson , but there being no other evidence against her but Sherlock , the Council for the prosecution would not examine him . Acquitted . 337 . + Frances Stanton , was indicted for that she on the 13th of October 1741 , did utter and publish as true , a forged and counterfeited will of Michael Ryan , otherwise Ryant , wherein he gives and bequeaths to his sister Eleanor Walleis , all his estate both real and personal , and appoints her executrix of this his last will and testament , dated the 26th of March 1736 , with a counterfeit mark of Michael Ryan thereunto subscribed , and said to be signed , sealed , published and declared , as and for his last will and testament , in the presence of Henry Farmer , Joseph Stones and John Davis . With intent to defraud our Sovereign Lord the King , she the said Francis Stanton at the same time of uttering and publishing the same knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited . Edward Bentham . These are the books of the Torrington ; there 's one Michael Ryant entered as an able seaman on board the Torrington , March 14 , 1738 9 , and died October 13 , 1740. there appears to be due to him 22 l . 17 s. 11 d. Francis Sherlock . Robert Rochead came to me and told me the Torrington was come up , and there would be something worth picking up . We went on board , and one of the sailors said he had got a will of Michael Ryan 's , and it was hard he could not go to prove it . He shewed me the will , as soon as I had got the right name , Rochead said push away to the Navy Office , we will have the first blow . I went to the Prisoner 's lodging ( she had proved the will of one Adam Elviston belonging to the Windsor , and run away with the ticket , but I had a better look out now . ) Q . How often have you done this ? Sherlock . It is so often , that really I ca n't remember . Q . Is it twenty times ? Sherlock . Yes . Q . Is it forty times ? Sherlock . Yes ; I believe more than that . Q . Then you are v ery rich sure ? Sherlock . No , I am not , we had other people that run away with the profit ; persons of rich and high hands run away with the profit . I asked the Prisoner whether she should personate the sister of Michael Ryan ; and she agreed to it . I took a will out of my pocket , and filled it up before her face , and read it over to her ; I wrote the name of Farmer , and Rochead wrote the name of Stones ; I wrote the name of Ryan , and he made the mark : the name of Davis was wrote after , it is a different sort of ink . Mr. Huntridge produced the will , and proved he had it out of the Prerogative Office : [ then the will was read . ] Sherlock . The Prisoner , Rochead , and I , went to the Commons , and she went to Mr. Alexander 's , a proctor ; she returned and said , she had proved the will , and the probate would be ready next morning . The next day I went , but we had no money to pay for the probate , and I desired Mr. Alexander to let his clerk go to the Navy Office to get the ticket : when we came there the name was Ryant upon the books , and the clerk would not deliver the ticket , because the probate was in the name of Ryan , but Mr. Alexander 's clerk said he would get it done properly , and he got the words ( otherwise Ryant ) interlined . The next day we went again , the Prisoner , Rochead , and Mr. Alexander 's clerk , went all in together , and brought out the ticket - I believe Mr. Alexander 's clerk had a crown for his trouble . The Prisoner , Rochead , and the clerk , went to Mr. Parr 's at the Blue Anchor in Crouched Friers , and the Prisoner could not remember the time of his entering on board , or the time of his death , or any thing . Mr. Parr said she was an impudent creature , and would have nothing to do with her ; we were forced as we had no money to leave the probate and ticket with Mr. Alexander 's clerk . We went to one Nicholas Hussey , who paid a guinea for it , and took it out of the clerk 's hand . After the demur at Mr. Parr 's we gave her fresh instructions , and she went through it very well , and it was sold to Mr. Coward Mr. Hexshaw 's clerk , who discounted it for 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. in the pound , and we had a draught upon Casewell and Mount . The Prisoner received the money , and kept back four guineas , I threw the rest down upon the table ; I believe we did get another guinea from her ; then we paid Hussey the guinea we borrowed , and a guinea for interest . Mr. Alexander . The jurat is of my writing , but I ca n't remember the person of the Prisoner . Mr. Purvis . I made out the ticket for the pay of Michael Ryan in the Torrington , but can not remember the face of the Prisoner upon any particular occasion .

Robert Barrow . The Prisoner told me she was a poor woman , had a brother killed at La Guerra , and that she had not money to get a letter of administration . My wife advised me to pay for the administration , and said , if I did not do good in the world , I was not fit to live , so I sent her a guinea to do it . She went to the Navy Office in order to get a ticket for the wages , and was taken up by Mr. Walraven . Cazia Newing . Stephen Newing was my own brother , he has a mother living at Margate in Kent - He has three sisters and a brother now living - The Prisoner is no kin at all . John Walraven . On the 5th of January , Mrs. Cazia Newing came to me , she went to the Commons in order to administer , and upon examining the office she found there were letters of administration granted to the Prisoner , so I got her taken up .
