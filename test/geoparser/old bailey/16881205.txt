See summary . ] Peter Thomas , was Tryed for stealing a Watch from the person of Nathaniel Glover , on the 22d of October last : But upon Tryal it only appearing they were late drinking together , and that the Watch , of which no Demand was made in some days , might be elsewhere dropt , Glover having likewise inferred it in the Gazette as lost , and not stole , with the promise of a Reward to those that found and returned it and moreover , the Prisoner 's Reputation appearing to be candid , he was acquitted . Elizabeth Cropley , alias Perry , was Tryed for stealing three Guinea 's , and 13 s. and 3 d. the Monies of Isaac Lane of St. Martins Ludgate . When upon Tryal it appeared that Mrs. Lane going along the Street had her Pocket pickt , and applying herself for the Recovery of her Money to some persons about Newgate , the Prisoner , by coming to change a Guinea , was discover 'd ; and then upon stricter Examination , but weakly , denied the Fact , the other Guinea 's being found upon her ; so that being known to be a Notorious Pickpocket , she was found Guilty of the Felony .

See summary . ] Peter Maxfield , was Tryed for Robbing the House of Thomas Maxfield of White-chappel , on the 17th of November last , and taking thence 104 l. in Monies , with some Writings , Rings , Plate , and Houshold Goods of a considerable value , part of which were found about him : But there being no Proof of his committing the Burglary , he was found guilty of the Felony only . [ Branding . See summary . ] Benjamin Hall was Tried for Entering the house of John Oliver in Aldgate Ward about 11 of the clock in the Evening , and taking thence 6 pewter Dishes , value 30 s.

However upon his Trial he endeavoured to extenuate the Crime , by urging , That he was going with it to Shoe lane , there to deposit it , till the true Owner might be inquired out . But this Discourse being look 'd upon as frivolous , he was found guilty of the Felony to the value of 10 d. but acquitted of the Burglary , in consideration no proof appear 'd that he was the party that took the Goods out of the house , & c. [ Whipping . See summary . ] William Mosely was Tryed for taking or purloining 10 l. of the Monies of Richard Southby , with whom he had lived six Years in the nature of an Apprentice . The Evidence against him was , That being suspected and taxed , upon the finding 10 s. about him , he acknowledg 'd that at sundry times within the last Year he had defrauded his Master of 10 l. In Objection to which , being Confession so alledged against him in Court , he said , That what he had confessed was through Fear and Constraint , by reason his Master had struck him , and dealt roughly with him , to extort an Acknowledgment . But his Confession , by other Witnesses , appearing to be rather frankly , than by compulsion ; and that he had further acknowledged to have gotten his Master 's Key , the better to enable him to take the said Monies , and facilitate the Enterprize without Suspition , he was found guilty of Felony . [ Branding . See summary . ] Edmund Mathews of the Parish of St. Martins in the Fields , was Tryed for killing Charles D'Laune of the said Parish on the 4th of November last . The proof against him was , That coming at somewhat an unseasonable time to ask for a Woman in a house or Cellar Apartment in Long-Acre , and being told there was none of that Name there , growing incredulous , he demanded to be further satisfied . And thereupon being told , There were only Two Women in Bed , and asked , If he knew her when he saw her ? And thereupon some other words arising , he fell to quarrel with the Deceased , challeng-him at first to Box ; but whil'st he was laying down a small Stick he had in his hand , to answer , as was conjectured , the Expectation of the Prisoner , he , viz . Mathews , gave him so forcible a blow over the head with a Stick or Cane , that stunning him , he was obliged to fall on the Bed , and from that Time languished sensless till the 4th of November , and then died . In excuse of which the Prisoner pleaded , That he was altogether a stranger to the Deceased , and that he never had any Malice towards him ; but that when the unfortunate Blow was given , he endeavoured , what in him lay , to support , succor , and contribute to his Recovery , not attempting to make his Escape ; But it plainly appearing that the Provocation begun and continued on the part of the Prisoner , he was found guilty of wilful Murder . [ No punishment . See summary . ] William Hussy of the Parish of St. Martins in the Fields , was Tryed as Accessory to the Murder of William Henric , as being aiding and abetting one Mr. Hacket , in compassing the death of the said Henric , on the 6th of July last . The Evidence for the King was , That the Prisoner and two others came into the house of the deceased , being a private house , and demanded Ale ; which being denied , one of them proceeded to ask for Whores , and Swords being drawn , fell to breaking the Windows , which occasioned the Skirmish , in which the Woman of the house was pricked in the back , and Henric received a mortal Wound of which he languished till the 14th of November , and then died . And much about the same time , or somewhat before , died Hacket of the Wound he had received of Henric . In Extenuation of this Charge , the Prisoner pleaded , That Henric 's Wife had broke his Sword before any Wounds were given , and render 'd him altogether incapable of contributing to the death of her Husband : But the Evidence being sum 'd up , and the Law in that Case approved to extend to Aiders and Abetters , as well as to the Party immediately committing the Fact , the Jury , upon a second going out , brought Mr. Hussy in Guilty of Murder . [ Death . See summary . ] Morgan Donow , was Tryed for killing one William Taff of Stepney , on the 24th of August , against whom upon Tryal it appeared , That the Deceased being at work with divers of his Companions , to the number of Seven or Eight in a Rope-yard , the Prisoner with a like number , being Soldier s , passing by , quarrelled with the Deceased , and others , which occasioning a considerable Disorder , by the gathering a concourse of People , one of the Soldiers gave the Deceased his Death by a mortal Wound of a Sword under the Left-arm , of which he languished till the 18th of August , and then died . To this the Prisoner pleaded Ignorance , alledging , That in the concourse of People the Commotion occasioned , it was hard for the Witnesses to distinguish who gave the Wound , utterly protesting himself innocent of the Fact : But it appearing at least that he was very active in promoting the Disorder , and that the Assault was given without any provocation , the Jury , upon a second going out , upon directions as to the Law in that Case received from the Court , brought him in Guilty of Murder .

To this he pleaded , That being in Drink , he had blundered away inconsiderately , leaving his Two-pence , and the Tankard behind him , there being Company at the same Time in the Room . And although it was proved by the Prosecutor , That he had made an Overture of payment for 10 s. a week till the value of the Plate was computed ; yet he making out by several Witnesses , his Credit , Trust , and Reputation , as being very industrious in Painting , in which , by the way of Journey-work , it appeared he earned 18 s. per week , the Jury acquitted him of the Felony laid to his charge . Thomas Sherwood , was Tryed for stealing a Gelding , value 8 l. out of the Grounds of one Thomas Rogers in July last . The Proof against him was , That upon missing the Gelding , and inquiry made after him , the Prisoner was taken upon his back at a place called Southern , in the County of Middlesex , where they were seized together . To this he pleaded Justification , insisting , That he bought that Horse in Smithfield , though without Tolling ; saying , He had lived a considerable Time with a person in Southwark who keeps Livery Stables : And so far insinnated into the good Opinion of the Jury , though no Evidence appeared on his behalf ; That it created in them so great a belief of his Innocence as to Acquit him . John Baker an Irish-man , was Tryed for speaking dangerous and seditious Words , tending to the Terror and Disturbance of the King 's Liege Subjects , and a Threatning the Subversion of the Protestant Religion , on the 30th of October last . Against whom , upon Tryal , it appeared , That being at the Six-Bells , an Ale house in Lombard-street , there , upon some Discourse that arose touching Religion , and the present Juncture of Affairs , the Prisoner seeming inraged that the Pope and his Priests were disparaged by some of the Company , said , with an Audible Voice , That they who were not in Communion with the Church of Rome , were Hereticks ; and deserved to have their Bellies ripped up ; And that he shortly hoped to see their Bellies ripped up . And being reproved for these uncharitable Expressions , he went away in a Rage , and being found some time after upon the Exchange , he obstinately persevered in what he had said , urging , as before he had done , That he had been bred up in the Roman Catholick Religion , and that We , meaning the Protestants , were Heretick Dogs , & c. or words to the same effect . Whereupon being seized , he was committed : To his he pleaded Ignorance , utterly denying to have spoken the words ; but confessing he was warmed to hear the Pope , & c. vilified , and on that score he might speak unadvisedly , but that he meant no harm to the Protestants , as being obliged to them in doing Business for several Eminent of that Persuasion in London . However , the Court highly resenting the Expression , and representing the anger of such Liberty of Speech against an Established Religion , the Jury found him Guilty of the misdisdemeanor . [ Fine . See summary . ] Thomazine Strong , was Tryed for stealing Two pair of Shoes , value 6 s. from Henry Long , on the 8th of November last .

But that not being granted , the Jury , upon return of their Verdict , Acquitted him of the Fact laid in the Indictment . Ann Smith , and Ann Simmons , were Indicted together , for that they , together with one Turner , Robbed John Cross of the Parish of St. Sepulchres , of Gold and Silver to a very considerable value ; and pleading Not Guilty upon their Arraignment , it appear 'd upon Tryal , That whil'st the Prosecutor was busie about his Occasions , his Till , with the Money , and other Things , were taken away : And that having Notice one of the Parties were hankering about his Shop the Night the Robbery was committed , he soon after found opportunity to seize her , who not being confident enough altogether , to deny the Fact at that time , though in Court , she , as well as her Companion , disowned it ; and there being only a Boy that had been their confederate , give in Evidence against them as to what one of them had told him .
