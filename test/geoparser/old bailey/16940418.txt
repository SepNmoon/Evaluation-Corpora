But that did not appear ; for on the contrary , she liv 'd in good Repute , her Husband being an Anchor-Smith , and maintained her by his honest Labour . The Prisoner utterly deni 'd that ever he was in the house , or touch 'd the deceased , and called some Witnesses , who declared , that the Woman was well in health after the Hurt was done , and a great deal of malice appeared to be betwixt them , and no positive proof was against him as to the matter of Fact ; besides , he had Witnesses to prove for him , that the Woman owned before she died , that Mr. Easden did her no harm : So upon the whole , he was Acquitted . John Lawe , of St. Giles 's in the Fields Gent , was Arraigned upon an Indictment of Murther , for killing one Edward Wilson Gent . commonly called Beaux Wilson , a Person which by common Report of Fame , kept a Coach and six Horses , maintained his Family in great Splendor and Grandeur , being full of money , no one complaining of his being their Debtor ; yet from whence , or by what hand he had the Effects which caused him to appear in so great an Equipage , is hard to be determined . The manner of Fact was thus : There was some difference hapned to arise between Mr. Lawe and the Deceased , concerning a Woman , one Mrs. Lawrence , who was acquainted with Mr. Lawe ; upon which , on the 9th of April Instant , they met in Bloomsbury Square , and there fought a Duel , in which Mr. Wilson was killed . It was made appear also , that they had met several times before , but had not opportunity to fight . Besides , that there were several Letters sent by Mr. Lawe , or given to Mr. Wilson by him ; which Letters were very full of Invectives , and Cautions to Mr. Wilson to beware , for there was a design of Evil against him ; and there was two Letters sent by Mr. Wilson , one to Mr. Lawe , and the other to Mrs. Lawrence . Mr. Wilson 's man , one Mr. Smith , swore that Mr. Lawe came to his Master 's house a little before the Fact was done , and drank a Pint of Sack in the Parlor ; after which , he heard his Master say , That he was much surprised with somewhat that Mr. Lawe had told him . One Captain Wightman ; a person of good Reputation , gave account of the whole matter , and said , That he was a familiar Friend of Mr. Wilsons , and was with him and Mr. Lawe at the Fountain Tavern in the Strand , and after they had staid a little while there , Mr. Lawe went away after which Mr. Wilson and Captain Wightman took Coach , and were drove towards Bloomsbury ; whereupon Mr. Wilson stept out of the Coach into the Square , where Mr. Lawe met him ; and before they came near together , Mr. Wilson drew his Sword , and stood upon his Guard . Upon which , Mr. Lawe immediately drew his Sword , and they both pass 'd together , making but one pass , by which Mr. Wilson received a mortal Wound upon the lower part of the Stomach , of the depth of two Inches , of which he instantly died . This was the Sum of the Evidence for the King . The Letters were read in Court , which were full of Aggravations on both parts , without any Name subscribed to them . There were other Witnesses that saw the Dual fought , who all agreed in their Depositions , that they drew their Swords and pass 'd at each other , and presently Mr. Wilson was killed Mr. Lawe in his defence , declared , That Mr. Wilson and he had been together several times before the Duel was fought and never no Quarrel was betwixt them , till they met at the Fountain Tavern , which was occasioned about the Letters ; and that his meeting with Mr. Wilson in Bloomsbury was merely an accidental thing , Mr. Wilson drawing his Sword upon him first , upon which he was forced to stand in his own defence . That the misfortune did arise only from a sudden heat of Passion , and not from any Propense Malice . The Court acquainted the Jury , That if they found that Mr. Lawe and Mr. Wilson did make an Agreement to fight , though Wilson drew first , and Mr. Lawe killed him , he was ( by the construction of the law ) guilty of murder : For if two men suddenly quarrel , and one kill the other , this would be but Manslaughter ; but this case seemed to be otherwise , for this was a continual Quarrel , carried on betwixt them for some time before , therefore must be accounted a malicious Quarrel , and a design of murder in the person that killed the other ; likewise that it was so in all Cases . The Tryal lasted long and the Prisoner had persons of good Quality , who gave a fair account of his Life in general , and that he was not given to Quarreling , not a person of an ill Behaviour . The Jury having considered of a Verdict very seriously , they found that Mr. Lawe was guilty of Murder . [ Death .
