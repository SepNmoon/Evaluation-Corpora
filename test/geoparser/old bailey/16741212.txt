Being a more perfect Narrative published for general satisfaction . Printed in the Year , 1674 . NEWS From the Sessions At the Old-Bayly , the 12th . of December , 1674 . AT this Sessions of Oier and Terminer for the City of London , and County of Middlesex , holden at Justice-Hall in the Old-Bayly , begun the Ninth , and continued till the 12th . of this Instant December , 1674 . Several Bills being found by the Grand Jury , or Inquest . Amongst many others , two Indictments were exhibited against one William Burnet , by birth ( as is said a Scotchman but educated at St. Omers , Dorway , or some other forraign Seminary ) by the first he was charged to be a Romish Priest , having received orders beyond the Seas , and that contrary to the statute ( in that case made and provided ) he had presumed to come into England , and so incurred the Penalties of High Treason . By the second , he was indicted for perverting and seducing several of his Majesties good subjects , and reconciling them to the Church and See of Rome . The prosecution being grounded upon several statutes , as those of the 23 . Eliz Cap.I . 3 . Jac . Cap . 4 . & c. whereby it is enacted. `` That to absolve , persuade , or withdraw any subject `` from their obedience to the King , or to reconcile `` them to the Pope ; or to draw them to the `` Popish Religion , or move them to promise obedience `` to any other state , or procure , Counsel , or aid them `` that do it , shall be connted and punished as High `` Treason . Vide . Lamb.220.226.4I2 . and Dalt.232 . Upon the first of these Indictments no sufficient Evidence being produced , the Jury could not thereupon bring him in Guilty ; as the second there was full proof that he had often endeavoured to reconcile divers of his Majesties Protestant subjects to the Romish Church , and had actually perverted several to embrace the Roman Catholique Religion , and assert and maintain the Popes supremacy in matters Ecclesiastical , & c. To all which he had very little to object , only alleadged , that if it were a Crime so Capital him to persuade People to the Roman Catholique Religion , ( which he was verily persuaded was the onely true one ) then it must be the same offence in Quakers and other different persuasions , since they as well as he made it their endeavour to draw people from the Church of England to their particular party . But to this was easily answered , that the very Words of the Law had expressed the Roman Catholique religion or Popery , but no such thing of any other Faction , and that Recriminations were no excuse , much less Justification ; Whereupon after a full hearing , Debating , and weighing of the matter , the Jury brought him in guilty of High Treason upon the last Indictment , and accordingly on Saturday he received sentence , To be Hang 'd , Drawn , and Quartered ; which he received with a modest Generosity , saying these words , Gloria in Excelsisdeo . & c. The next Criminal we ought to mention for the likeness of their offence in its nature and punishment , though of Different sex and manner , was Mistris Ann Petty , Widdow , a person of above sixty years of age ; she lived lately near Holbourn Conduit , but formerly in the Green-yard in Leaden-Hall , her Husband some Years since , in a very melancholy Discontented humour upon I know not what provocations went and hang 'd himself , since whose decease this woman hath followed several indirect courses , but more especially for Clipping of money , for which purpose she held a Correspoddence with some wild Apprentices , Servants , or Casheirs to eminent Citizens , who it is said ) brought her summs of large lawful money which she clipt and returned , allowing them five pound in the Hundred more or less , and yet got considerably her self for her own pains , as she then apprehended , though now she is like to pay dear enough for it : for she was here indicted , and Evidence came in that saw her at the Clipping trade , and others that had bought divers quantities of silver melted down of her , besides the violent suspition for that some of her tools were taken in the house , together with Fileings and Clippings to a good considerable value ; upon which she was brought in guilty of high Treason , and sentenced to be Drawn on an Hurdle or Sled to Smithfield ( the usual place for such Executions ) and there to be burned to Death : A Youth her Son was also Indicted , but not being proved to be any way concerned in his Mothers ill practises was acquitted . Edward Lancet , Elijah Arnold , and Bartholomew Jennings were arraigned for Fellony and Burglary ; For that they on the Lords Day had broken into a Merchant s house in Crutchet Fryers , when nobody was at home but a poor honest Maid-servani , whom they immediately took and bound and gagg 'd her sothat she was not able to utter a word : they took away there in Plate and Money to the value of two hundred pounds or thereabouts ; but diligent information being given out and Enquiries made upon the sale or disposal of some of the things they were seized , and now Indicted , Convicted , and Condemned , ( being old Malefactors ) to be Hang 'd for the same . Robert Harrison was arraigned , found guilty and condemned for killing a person in White-Cross-street , which he endeavoured to shew was done by misadventure or in his own defence , but the proof was Evident , and he for it condemned to be hang 'd , as in such cases of Fellony and murder is accustomed . Joseph Foster was convicted for Burglary and Fellony , though he did not steal above the value of thirty shillings , yet being a notorioos offender that had often commenc 'd in Newgate University , and but a Sessions or two ago got off by pleading a pardon , he now received sentence of Death . John Clark was likewise condemned for Burglary or House-breaking ; three more were concerned with him , but he only was as yet taken , though 't is not doubted but we shall very shortly have an account of the rest . Henry Robertson a person often free of this Corporation was condemned for Jilting or stealing several peices of Plate , he had both been burnt in the hand , and transported ( as it is said ) before , but now it is thought must receive a Passport into another world , being with the rest condemned to dye . Besides these nine ordered to receive Capital punishment , there were nine others that got off by the benefit of the Clergy , and carryed away the Law in their own hands . Twelve that prayed and obtained the favour of Transportation , and four sentenced to Shove the Fumbler , or receive the correction of the gentle Lash for several crimes respectively no less tedious , than impertinent here to be recited . There were likewise divers Romish Recusants Indicted for not repairing to their respective Parish Churches , and the Bills found against them according to the statutes in that case made and provided .
