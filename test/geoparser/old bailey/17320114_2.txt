 I heard Charles Bird say , that he was asleep when the Quarrel began betwixt his Master and Mistress ; but I am subpoened by the Prosecutor as well as by the Prisoner , and therefore I will speak the Truth on both Sides . The Prisoner told me and Frank Me riday , that if he could raise 10 Guineas , there was one who would raise Evidences to confront the King 's Evidence , and prove his Wife was Lunatick , and confirm any thing that his own Witnesses would swear to . I asked him how this Accident came about ? he said , I wo n't wrong my Conscience , I believe the Blows I gave her , and my threatening to fetch my Cane , made her throw herself out of the Window . He said , her Hand was cut with the Glass in throwing herself out , and bid me go to the Window and see if the Glass was not bloody . I look 'd , but found no Blood on the Glass nor was it broke , but only crack 'd ; so that it could not cut her Hand . In looking over the Goods , we found in his Waistcoat-pocket a dirty Cap of his Wife 's , which was a little bloody [ Mr. Furnell , in his Deposition above , says , the Deceas 'd had no Cap on , when she fell from the Window . ] Prisoner . I 'll tell your Lordship how that Cap came in my Pocket . My Wife complained of a Pain in her Belly , and desired me to fetch the Midwife , but before you go , says she , pray lend me the Pot , for I want to make Water : So I reached her the Pot , and she try 'd to make Water , but could not . Then she cry 'd , O my Pains ! - Make haste . Jenny , says I , your Cap is very foul , Is it , says she , then take it , and give me a clean Mob out of the Drawer . But as I was pulling out the Drawer , she cry 'd again , O my Belly ! O Robin , make haste - Run for the Midwife ; and so in the hurry I run down Stairs with the Cap in my Hand , and thrust it into my Pocket as I went along . Thomas Doughty , again . The Prisoner told me that the Deceas 'd cut her Hand with the Hook of the Window , but I looked on it , and it was not bloody . James Turner . I was to have taken Charles Bird 'Prentice . I saw him two Days after his Mistress 's Death : He said , that the Day before she dy 'd , when he came to Dinner , she called him Names , he asked her why she did so ? and she said , She did not care what she said , for she must die that Night . William Perkins . On Wednesday , about 10 o ' Clock , I went to the Prisoner 's House , and ask 'd him to go with me to Cock-Hill , which he did , but missing the Person I wanted , I invited him to dine at my House : We had a Mutton-Pye and a Goose for Dinner , and a Half-crown Bowl of Punch betwixt 8 or 9 of us , and each Man had a Pint of Drink besides , which was all the Liquor that was then drank . Some Men were quarreling at my House , and he parted them - I never knew him quarrelsome - He stayed till past Eleven at Night , and then went away , neither drunk nor sober . Thomas Chetwin , Charles Waters , and several other Evidences , appeared in the Prisoner 's Behalf , who all gave him the Character of an honest Man . Prisoner . I can call 20 or 30 more to my Character , but I will give the Court no farther Trouble : I had ten Hours Time to make my Escape , which I should have done , If I had been guilty ; but I rather chose to stay and take Care of my Children ; and I am as innocent of her going out of the Window , as the Child in the Womb . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of both Indictments , and the Court past Sentence of Death upon him accordingly . 11. John Platt , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing 3 pair of Shoes , the Goods of Samuel Worsly ; 1 pair of Boots , the Goods of William Cary ; and 1 pair of Boots , the Goods of Barnaby Humby , the 5th of this Instant January . The Jury found him guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 12. Elizabeth Turner , was indicted for privately stealing 5 Yards of Cambrick , the Goods of Andrew Biggs , in his Shop , the 16th of December last . The Jury found him guilty to the Value of 4s . 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 13. Corbet Vezey , of Stepney , was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , but being moved by a devilish Instigation , and wholly deprived of Humanity and Christian Charity , on the 10th of December , in the 4th Year of his present Majesty , with Malice afore-thought , on Mary his Wife , then being in Peace in the House of Thomas Finlow , in the said Parish , did make an Assault , and against her Will did put , lock up , and detain her in a Garret in the said House , and did not allow her sufficient Meat , Drink , and other Necessaries to sustain Life , and thus continued to keep her till the 16th day of December , in the 5th Year of his said Majesty , by which Means she languished , and languishing lived from the said 10th Day of December , in the 4th Year of the King , till the 30th Day of December , in the 5th Year of the King , and then miserably perished and died : and that so of his Malice afore-thought , he kill 'd and murder 'd the said Mary his Wife . Christopher Best , Beadle . On the 16th of December last , as I was coming by Mr. Finlow 's House ( the Four Swans in Mile-end Town , near the Turnpike ) a Man run a-cross the Road , and said , there 's a Girl upon the House : I looked up and saw two Legs , and presently she fell down upon an old Shed , and so to the Ground : She was stunned with the Fall , and seemed to be lifeless . I took her up , and enquired who she was ; for presently a great many People were got about me , but no Body could answer my Question : Her Body was all black , and her Legs were perfectly covered with a white Mold . She had on a thin old Crape-Gown , and a Bit of a red Petticoat , but no Shift nor Stockings - By-and-by a Woman came out of the Four Swans , took her under her Arm ( for she was light enough ) and carried her in ; I followed , and still enquired who she was , and at last the Prisoner came , and said it was his Wife . And are you not asham 'd to keep your Wife so ? says I , she looks as if she was starved , she 's nothing but Skin and Bone ! No , no , says he , she 's not starved . Some of the Company gave the poor Woman a Dram , and she began to come to herself . I desired she might be put to Bed , and taken care of : She was carry 'd up Stairs , I would have followed directly , but they refused to let me , for they said they must put her on a clean Shift . Sometime after this , some Women went up , and I followed them into the Garret ; and then she had got a Shift on . There was a half-peck Loaf wrap 'd in a Cloth , and hanging up by a String : It was very hard and mouldy . I asked , why it was hung there ? and somebody answered , to keep it from the Mice . The Deceas 'd being pretty well come to herself , said to me , For God 's Sake stay by me ! I have been used barbarously ! I am starved to Death ! I stay 'd with her about half an Hour , and came again next Day . The Lock and Key of her Door were without side : I asked the Reason of it , and was told by the Woman of the House , that it was to lock the Deceas 'd up . I found several Bits of hard Cheese lying about the Garret . The Deceas 'd said , Those Bits of Cheese are laid for me , and I would eat them if I could , but in the weak Condition I am in , I might as well try to eat a Piece of Board . When they brought me up any Victuals , they used to leave it just within the Door , and if I could not get out of Bed to fetch it , I might lie and starve : And once I made shift to crawl to the Door , but was not able to get back again ; so that I was forced to lie there in the Cold all Night ; and they let me have none but cold hard Victuals , such I can seldom eat , and cold Small Beer . I have begg 'd many a time for a little Water-gruel , but all in vain . They would not so much as let me have a little Fire , or a bit of Candle , or Sheets to my Bed , tho ' they knew I was ready to perish with Cold , so that for want of these and other Necessaries my very Skin has peel 'd off . And so saying , she shew 'd me a Paper in which she had put some of the bits of her Skin as they peel 'd off . They were all white and mouldy , and look 'd just like her Legs which were cover 'd over with a white Mold . Her Flesh was all over wasted , and black where it was not mouldy . - Her Flesh did I say ? No ; I mean her Skin , for I saw no sign of any Flesh that she had . I asked her why she did not cry out for help ? and she said she had done so , and that thereupon the Prisoner came up and Horse-whipp 'd her , and threatened that he would murder her if it was not for the Law . She lived 10 or 11 Days after this . I went to see her every Day . She spit Blood the first Day , and was all along very feeble , and complain 'd of a Weakness inwardly . She said she was 55 or 56 Years of Age . Coroner . Did she tell you why she got upon the House ? Best . Yes : She said she did it thro ' Necessity , as thinking it better to make an end of her Life in that manner , than to starve to Death . Court . You say her Body was black , might not that Blackness come by the Fall ? Best . I believe not , for her Body was all over black , she was stunn 'd with the fall , but recover 'd in about a Quarter of an Hour , and I did not perceive that she had received any further Hurt , for she was so wasted away , that she fell very light , and then her fall was broke by an old Shed . Court . Do you think she could not eat the Cheese ! was it so hard as not to be eatable ? Best . Perhaps hail Man might eat it ; but I believe that a Woman in her weak Condition could not . Court . Did she say why he us 'd her thus ? Best . She said , It was because she refus 'd to sell a small Estate . Court . How long had she been confin 'd thus ? Best . She said a Year and a half . Court . Did she give you this Account more than once ? Best . Yes , several times . Court . And did she never vary in her account ? Best . No , not in the least Circumstance . She repeated the very same Things from the first time to the last . Court . Do you think she was in her right . Senses ? Best . Yes , without doubt , she was examin 'd before Justice Leake . Court . Is her Examination here ? Clerk of the Arraigns . Yes , my Lord ; here it is . Court . Who proves it ? Richard Dun . I , my Lord ; I was present when the Deceas 'd was examin 'd before Mr. Justice Leake . It was on the 17th of Dec. last . Court . Look on it ; Is that her Hand ? Did you see her sign it ? Dun . I did , my Lord . Court . Was it read over to her before she sign 'd it ? Dun . It was , my Lord . Court . Was she in her full Senses when this Examination was taken , and did she seem to consider herself as a dying Woman ? Dun . I thought so , my Lord . Court . Let the Examination be read . Clerk , Reads . Middlesex , ss . The Examination of Mary Vezey , Wife of Corbet Vezey , now of Mile-End old Town , Weaver , taken on her Oath before me Stephen Martin Leake Esq ; One of his Majesty 's Justices of the Peace for the said Country , the 17th Day of December 1731. Who faith , That she came from Christ-Church Hospital about the Month of April 1730 . ( when she was almost recover 'd of a Fever and Learnness she had ) to her said Husband Corbet Vezey , at his Lodgings at the Sign of the Four Swans in Mile-End Old Town aforesaid : At which time he put her in a Garret in the said House , and put a Lock on the outside of the Door thereof , and confin 'd her till November following , about which time she obtained leave of her said Husband to go out and beg a Shift , and about a Week 's time she return 'd , and her said Husband then put her in the said Garret , and confin 'd her to the 16th Instant , and kept her during that time chiefly with cold Meat , and sometimes with dry and mouldy Bread , and cold Small Beer , which she by reason of her Indisposition could not eat , putting it sometimes just within side the Door , which she was obliged to croep on her Hands and Knees to fetch , and bad neither Candle nor Fire all the time , which she often complaining of , and desiring him often to send her hot Victuals , good Bread , warm Beer , or some Water-Gruel , which he always refused ; and desired him to let her have a Minister , which he likewise refused ; and has several times threatened her , that he would kill her , if it was not for the Laws of the Land . And that he used her as above partly upon Account of her refusing to sell a small Estate she had , and his keeping another Woman Company . And that she lately offer 'd to call out at the Window to the Neighbours for Relief , and her said Husband then whipped her with a Horse-whip . And the 16th of this Instant December , in the Evening , after her said Husband brought her up some Bread , and she desiring him to bring her some Water-gruel , which he refused , and she being almost starved and tired of her Life with the above Treatment , got out of a Window of the Said Garret , and tumbled down into the Highway , to make an end thereof . Jur . cor . me 17 die Decembri Anno Domini 1731 . Steph . Martin Leake . The Mark of + Mary Vezey . Philip Betty , High-Constable . On the 17th of December , by Justice Leake 's Order , I went to enquire about this Affair . I found the Prisoner in his Loom , and I ask 'd him , Why he us 'd his Wife in such a Manner ? He took me up shortly , and said , He 'd never use her better . Upon this I secur 'd him , and went to his Wife , who gave me the self same Account , as she did to the Justice upon her Examination . I was present when she sign 'd that Examination , and she then seem 'd to have some Thoughts of Death ; but so perfectly in her Senses , that if the Clerk mistook but a Word in his rough Draught , she always observ 'd it , and desir 'd it might be corrected ; and she repeated it 2 or 3 times , that her Husband refus 'd her Water-gruel that Day , and therefore she thought to end her Life by getting out of Window . Sarah Brees . I went to see the Deceas 'd the Morning after she got out of the Window . I found her a Bed , very weak and sore , full of Pain , and in a sad Condition . She was a mere Skeleton to look at , her Body was as black as Wainscot , and there was nothing but Skin over her Bones . She told me she was starv 'd for want of Necessaries , and had neither Fire nor Candle , and that he often swore he 'd murder her if it was not for the Law . I ask 'd her , why she got out of the Window ? She said , she thought to make an end of a miserable Life , for she had undergone so much , that she was not able to bear it any longer ; that she first attempted to cut her Throat , but the Knife she had was so dull , that she thought it would rather add to her Pain than release her from it . Afterwards she thought to Hang herself , and at another time to strangle herself in the Bed , but at last resolv 'd to throw herself from the Garret Window . She told me the same Story several times ; the last time I saw her was 3 or 4 Days before her Death . I had no Acquaintance with her before this , when the Prisoner asked me to go up and see her ; I said I did not know her , why then , says he , if you do n't know her , nor she know you , she 'll owe you the less Discourse . He was carried to Prison that Night . I believe she did not die by the fall , but was starved to Death . James Badily . Justice Leake sent me Word of what had happened to the Deceas 'd , she being a Relation of mine . I went to see her next Day , and found her a Bed in the Garret . She was very weak and low , and almost wasted away to nothing but Skin and Bones , I enquir 'd why she got out of the Window ; she answer 'd 't was to release herself from her Misery and Consinement , and added , that she had been kept there about 18 Months , except a little time ( Once ) when she was out ; that she had neither Fire nor Candle , nor the common Necessaries of Life to subsist ; that she was kept with mouldy Bread , hard Crust of Cheese , and Small Beer , and sometimes Meat , but all Cold ; that they always set it for her on the Ground , just within her Door , and if she could scramble out of Bed for it she might ; and that sometimes she was so Cold that she could not get the Victuals to her Month , but has been forced to let it drop out of her Fingers again ; and that she did not dare to call for help , because he threatened to beat her : Her Skin was quite discolour 'd , and she look 'd like an Anatomy . I visited her 3 or 4 times before her Death , she was in her Senses all along , and never varied in the Accounts she gave me of the ill Usage she receiv 'd from her Husband . About 2 Months before this happen 'd , I met the Prisoner 's Father in White-Chapel , and asked him , where my Kinswoman ( the Deceas 'd ) was ? He answer 'd , with her Husband . And do they agree any better , says I ? Why , says he , I believe she wants for nothing . I told him I was glad of it , for I had heard otherwise before , and that when she went into the Hospital he would allow her nothing , for though he was but a Journeyman Weaver , yet he must have had some Money , because he took in Pawns . Court . Did she want for Victuals ? J. Badily . She had no such Victuals as was fit for a Person in her Case to eat , and then the Room was in such a Condition with her own Nastiness ( for she had not Necessaries to case herself , and to keep herself clean , ) that the scent of it was very noisome to her . Court . Did she receive any Hurt by the fall ? J. Badily . She told me she thought she had not , and I did not find that she was bruised . Prisoner . What did you say to me when I was in New-Prison ? J. Badily . The Prisoner talk 'd of coming to an Agreement with me . She had a small Estate of about 7 or 8 l. a Year , and he offer 'd that that should be made over to me if she would consent , and that he would allow me 3s . a Week more to maintain her ; but this was after he was taken up . Anne Badily . I went to the Deceased after her Fall , and found her in a very weak and lamentable Condition . She shew 'd me her Legs and Breast ; she was nothing but Skin and Bones ; her Skin was all black , and she look 'd just like an Anatomy that I have seen at a Surgeon 's . She told me she got out of Window to rid her self of a miserable Life . I asked why she did not send word to me , or some of her Neighbours , to come and help her ? She said she had no Body to send , and if she knock 'd or call 'd for Help , the Prisoner would come up and horse-whip her . There was a Half-Peck Loaf hung up in her Room , but it was dry and mouldy ; and several odd bits of Cheese lay about on the Ground , but she said her Stomach was so bad that she could not eat any of it . O Conson , said she , no Tongue can express , nor Heart conceive , the deplorable Miseries that I have felt ! I have been lock 'd up in this Room for a Year and a half , perishing with Hunger and Cold , and in want of the common Necessaries of Life . In the Extremity of Winter , without Candle ! without Fire ! without Conveniences to ease my self ! without Water to keep me clean , or Covering that would keep me Warm ! continually languishing , unable to help my self , and yet without a Friend to help me ! to comfort me ! to pity me ! In this Condition , tho ' I have hardly had Strength to get out of my Bed , my Victuals , cold ! and hard ! and mouldy ! has been brought but just within my Door , and there left upon the Ground , by the Creature that keeps Company with my Husband . I have been forced to crawl thither on my Hands and Knees , and when I have got to it , my Fingers have been so benunim 'd with Cold , that I have not been able to lift it to my Head , but have been necessitated to take it up from the Ground with my Mouth , and then it was seldom that I could eat it ! And sometimes I have been unable to creep back to my Bed again , so that I have been obliged to lie at the Door all Night , in the midst of Winter ! Many a time I have begg 'd for God 's sake for a little warm Beer ; and once , and but once , it was brought me . I had no better Place to case my self in that the Chimney , and there it used to be piled up together , so that not being able to bear the Smell , I have often been forced to lie with my Nose under the Pillow . Once I threw a little Water ( which I had in a broken Pan ) out of Window ; for which he came up and horse me . O ! Mr. Vezey , said I , you can ease your self where you please ! you do n't know what it is to want such Conveniences , sure if you did you would never use me thus ! He damn 'd me for an old stinking Bitch , and swore if it was not for the Law he would murder me ; and so went away again . You see , Consin , how my Hair is matted together ; he will not allow me so much as a Comb . I am almost devour 'd with Vermin , they have eat Holes in my Head . My Hair was so troublesome to me that I have taken a great deal of Pains to cut some of it off with an old rusty Knife . My own Filthiness has been intolerable to me . This , and much more , more than I can speak , I have suffer 'd ; because I was not willing to part with that little Estate of mine . After the Deceased had given me this Account , I desired her to consider with her self that she was a dying Woman , and therefore ought to be very careful that she spoke nothing but the Truth . Consin , said she again I have told you the Truth , and nothing but Truth ; I have suffer 'd more than I can tell you and yet I never called him any thing worse than Mr. Vezey . When I wanted any thing with him , I always said , Mr. Vezy , pray let me speak with you ; and his common Answer was , Damn you , for a Bitch ; if it was not for the Law I would murder you . Court . Was not the Fall the Cause of her Death ? A. Badily . I ask 'd her that Question , and she answer 'd , No ; I felt no Hurt whatever by the Fall , but I feel an inward Sinking and Decay , for want of the common Necessaries of Life ; and I assure you , Consin , on the Word of a dying Person , that I am starved to Death ; for tho ' I had some Victuals , it was such that in my weak Condition I could not sufficiently eat of to support Nature . And she begg 'd of me to get a Minister ; and I have since been very sorry that I did not do it at that time , but I did not then think she was so near her End . When I went into her Room ( tho ' it had been clean 'd out but a little before ) the Scent of it was so offensive that I could hardly bear it . She offer 'd to kiss me , but she was in such a sad Condition , and smelt so strong , that I was obliged to decline it . The Creature that belong 'd to the House was almost constantly with her , to hear what she said , and to keep her from speaking , as much as she could . As for the Prisoner , I know little of him , and never had any Conversation with him . Whenever I talk 'd with the Deceased on this Occasion , she constantly gave me the same Account , and never varied in the Circumstances of any one thing that she repeated . Thomas Panter . I am a Watchman in Mile-End Old Town , and was with Mr. Betty the High Constable when he went to take the Prisoner : and I then heard the Prisoner say that he had been out the Sunday before , and staid beyond Dinner-time , and that when he came home , the People of his House told him that his Wife had been meaning for her Dinner . Upon which he went up and horse-whip 'd her ; and , says he , that has put her in such a Fit of the Sullens , that she wo n't eat these 10 Days . Prisoner . I have not horse-whip 'd her these four Years . Matthew Davis . While the Prisoner was in Custody , he said , that he had been to take a Walk the Sunday before , and staid longer than ordinary , so that the Dinner was later than usual ; and when he came home , the People of the House told him , that the Deceased had call 'd for Victuals ; and he own 'd , that upon that he went up and horse-whip 'd her ; and he said , that ever since she had got a Fit of the Sullens , and would not eat her Victuals . Mary Renshaw . I was near the Deceased when she fell from the House ; I asked who she was , but no Body answer 'd . A Woman came out of the Four Swans , and carried her in . I went to see her the Sunday following , she told me they gave her nothing but dry Bread and hard Cheese , and sometimes cold Meat , and cold Small-Beer . That she had often begg 'd for Christ 's sake for a little warm Small Beer , but could never get it but Once . That they set the Victuals on the Ground just within the Door , and that sometimes she was so weak that she could not get to it . She was very sensible . She told me she was born the Year after the Fire of London . She took me by the Hand , and thank 'd me for coming to see her . Richard Harrison , Brother to the Deceased . Last November was a Twelvemonth , I found my Sister ( the Deceased ) in Forestreet , begging a Dish of Broth . I took her home with me , and kept her about a Fortnight ; but being a poor labouring Man , I could not afford to maintain her any longer , and she being willing to go home again , I went with her to her Husband , and as soon as ever she came in he turn 'd her up Stairs , and said , Get up , you damn 'd Bitch , to your Room , and there you shall starve , and never come out till you are brought out on four Mens Shoulders . I went to see her sometimes on a Sunday ; for as I was a working Man I could not spare time to go any other Day . She had no Shoes on her Bed , and was full of Vermin . When the Prisoner was at home he used to go up with me , but when he was abroad I could not get in , for he commonly took the Key with him . I offer 'd to take her home , if he would allow me for her Maintenance , and take my Bond that she should not be sent home to him again ; but he would not take my single Bond , and I could get no Body to be bound with me . Court . 'T is very strange that you should know your Sister was treated in this manner , and not complain to a Magistrate . Harrison . Why , I did speak of it to some People , and they told me that no Body could hinder him from locking his Wife up if he had a mind to it , for she was his Goods , and he might do what he would with her ; and I was a poor Man , and could not afford to go to Law . Court . What Reason did he give for using her thus ? Harrison . Because she would not part with a small Matter in the Country ; and he told me , if she would but do that he would make her a happy Woman . Court . Did you never sollicite him to let her have her Liberty ? Harrison . Yes ; I talk 'd with him about it the latter End of the Summer , and he told me , if I 'd take her home he 'd allow me 18 Pence a Week ; but I said she was then so weak that I cou 'd not get her home . Prisoner . At the Man-in-the-Moon Tavern in White-Chapel , I offered to settle the Estate upon him and his Brother , and allow him 2 s. a Week to keep her . Mr. Martin the Attorney was there at the same time . Harrison . Yes , he did so ; but that was the Year the King was crown 'd , and the Attorney said I must give Security to maintain her ; and I said I could give none : And as for the Estate he talks of , that was seiz 'd by my Brother , and I had no Money to go to Law about it . Prisoner . One Day when Richard Harrison went up with me to see my Wife , he said he would rather live in a Jail than live as she did . Says I , You talk as if you did not know what a Jail is . Why , says he , here 's Victuals and Drink indeed , but in a Jail I should have Company . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . When I first married this Wife I was a Journeyman Weaver , and I took the Man-in-the-Moon Ale-house in Skinners Street ; and no Couple could live more lovingly , for she was as good a temper 'd Woman as ever trod Shoe of Leather . But she begun to wrong me in my Alehouse , so that I have miss 'd a Guinea at a time ; and she would take my Linen away and carry it out of Doors ; and tho ' I was a good Husband , and very careful and sparing , yet I found I was run out above 60 Pounds , for I was a 100 and odd Pounds in debt , and had but 30 Pounds to pay it with , and I was hard press 'd for Money , and wept bitterly ; and yet I could not believe my own Eyes , for she had got such a fair deluding Tongue , that I loved her as I loved my Life . And she took this Linen - Mrs. Badily . It was none of your Linen . Prisoner . She took this Linen , and a matter of 19 Pounds in Money and Rings , and a Counterpain and other Things , and put them all in a Trunk , and sent them to the Three Goats-Heads in White-Chapel ; but as God would have it , I got Intelligence , and fetch 'd them all back again . Then I open 'd the Trunk , and look 'd over the Goods , and told the Money , and said , Mary , I desire that you would not carry my Things out at this rate , but let my own House hold my own , and if we can get Money let us keep it , there they are all again ! do so no more ; She cry 'd sadly , and said , She did it for fear they should be seiz 'd , and desir 'd me to give her the 3 Rings , which I did to make her easy , and when she got them she said , This is for such a One , and this for such a One , and this for such a One ; Zounds ! Says I , yes , my Lord , I did say Zounds , that I did , Zounds ! Says I , and which is for me ? Then she cry 'd again sadly for a Broad-Piece , which was my former Wife 's , and I told her , If she cry 'd her Heart out she should never have it ; but if she had a mind to look at it now and then she should and welcome . At another time I look 'd under the Bed , and pull 'd out a Handkerchief , and there was 25 s. in Half-pence , all but 2 naughty Farthings , and under the Drawers I found another with 17 l. in Silver in it ; this was 13 Months after we were married . Then she lent 30. in my Name to one Mackey , and she has I believe a great many Things out that I shall never hear of , and that 's the Reason that I confin 'd her . She had me Arrested by Mr. Badily ; she left my House , and I put her in the Postman to invite her Home , and once I gave half a Guinea only for the Sight of her , and then I could not have her away . After this she came again , and said , she was come to live with me ; and I said , Mary , come and welcome , if so be you will live honestly , and not rob me ; she made many fair Promises , and I believ 'd her again . I would have set her up in a little Brandy-Shop , in Bell-Yard , but she did not like the House : Then she pilfer 'd from me again ; if I had but a Farthing's-worth of Oatmeal , she would steal some of it , and hide it . I verily believe , that at times , she has robb 'd me of above a Quart of Oatmeal in this manner , and then she would steal my Butter , and Pudding , and Soap , and the Lord knows how many Things . and hide them upon the Bed's-Teaster , as if that was a Place to put Victuals in . But she would be doing , God knows , tho ' it was but a little . Joseph Avery . I never knew but that the Prisoner behav 'd himself well to his former Wife , and to this too , when they first went to live in Skinner's-Street . He told me of a Trunk , which , as he said , this Wife had carry 'd out , and desir 'd me , as I was Constable , to assist him in getting it again ; we went to the Three Goats-Heads in White-Chapel , and it was readily delivered to us upon demand , and it was sent home again ; I do n't know who carried it out , but this Wife of his had a very bad Name .

Mrs. Badily . The Deceas 'd told me before this Creature 's Face , that she never had a Sheet or a Blanket , nor any Chamber-Pot , but only a piece of an old broken Pan , and that she often desir 'd her to bring a little warm Beer , but was always deny 'd it , except only one time . This Creature would not go out of the Room all the while I was there , on purpose to hear what the Deceas 'd said to me . E. F. It is no such thing . Thomas Finlow , Father to the last Witness . Every Day we din 'd I saw them take a Plate of such Victuals as we had for Dinner , Meat , Pudding , or Dumplin ( hot or cold as it happened ) and carry it up Stairs ; and I saw them bring down the empty plate ; I am sure there was every time 3 times as much as I can eat , and enough for any reasonable Man : And every Day they carried up 2 Bottles of Beer . Court . Are you sure the Deceas 'd had all this ? Thomas Finlow . I know nothing of that , I am a feeble old Man , I never was up in her Room in my Life , and I never saw the Deceas 'd but that once when her Brother brought her Home , and then she was very thin and poor . Ann Crew [ Drew ] a Washerwoman . When I have been washing at Finlow 's House , I have seen them carry up Plates of Victuals , such as they had themselves for Dinner , and as much as I could eat , and seen them bring the empty Plates down again . I have been up in her Room 4 Times . The first Time I went up , she complained for Beer , and said , she was almost parched up with Drought . I told the Prisoner of it , and he took no Notice of it at first , but I speaking to him again , he made me go up , and then Mrs. Finlow was there , and shewed me 4 or 5 Bottles of Beer . I asked the Deceas 'd why she complained for Drink when she had so much ? she said , She let it stand there because she lov 'd to have it stale , and to drink it one under another . Court . Did you see those Bottles when you first went up ? Crew . No ; I was not in the Room then , for he was gone out , and had the Key with him : She spoke to me through the Door . The next Time I went up , I swept the Room , and made the Bed . Court . What kind of Bedding had she ? Crew . There was 1 Sheet , 3 Blankets , and a Counterpain ; they were good tidy Blankets , fit for a poor Body 's Bed . I washed her Shifts . Court . How often ? Crew . As often as she soul 'd them . Court . That 's not the Question . How often have you washed them ? Crew . Why , my Lord , she would not always soul them : She said , she would not wear them out , because she was willing to keep them to go into the Hospital ; and so she cut the Sheets , and pinned the Pieces about her instead of a Shift . Court . You will not answer the Question . Crew . I have washed 2 Shirts . Court . Did you wash any Sheets for her ? every Month , or two Months . Crew . I can not say how often ; but I have washed Sheets . She had 9 Caps . Court . And how often have you washed Caps for her ? Crew . As often as she soul 'd them ; but she would not soul them . Court . When you went up , how did you get in ? Crew . With other Company ; my Mistress let me in : But the last Time the Key was in the Door , and I got in myself , and carried her up a Couple of Eggs and a Rosher of Bacon ; and she said , Very well . This was about 9 or 10 Weeks before she died . Court . What Conveniencies had she ? Crew . A Chamber-pot , and a Pan to spit in . I swept the Room after she fell down ; I never saw any Ordure about the Room , nor any Nastiness in it but Dust . This is one of her Aprons - and this one of her Handkerchiefs - The Deceas 'd gave them me for laying her out . She had 18 Handkerchiefs , 2 colour 'd Aprons , and 1 Muslin Apron ; they were in a Trunk in her Garret , and I did not see that the Trunk was lock 'd . I never saw her out of Bed but once , and then I peeped through the Key-hole , and she was standing on the Floor . Benjamin Vezey , the Prisoner 's Brother . I frequented the House where my Brother lived , and dined there 2 or 3 Times a Week . Elizabeth Finlow is my Wife 's Sister . As soon as the Victuals was taken off of the Spit , or out of the Pot , whether it was Fish , Flesh , or Fowl , a Plate of the same was carried up for the Deceas 'd , and it was more than I could eat . Court . Did you see the Meat given to her ? Vezey . I never was up but once , and that was 5 Months ago . Court . And what had you for Dinner then ? Vezey . A Goose roasted , a Giblet-Pye , and 2 Rabbits . Court . That was very well indeed , considering your Sister boarded both a Man and his Wife for 7 s. a Week . Vezey . And my Sister carried a Plate full , heaped . Court . Are you sure it was given to the Deceas 'd ? Vezey . I do n't know that ; but after Dinner I carried up a Dram of Brandy , and she drank it , and made no complaints to me . Court . Do you know why she was confin 'd ? Vezey . To tell you the Truth , my Brother said , that if she came down , nothing would be too hot nor too heavy for her , she was so given to pilFering . Court . What condition was the Room in ? Vezey . Very clean , handsome and decent . She ask 'd me why I did not come and see her oftener ? I had lodg 'd in the same Room my self before she came . Prisoner . What did she say to you after she fell off of the House ? Vezey . Sister , says I , how do you do ? I do n't know ye , says she . What ! says I , do n't you know your Brother Ben ? O ! says she , is it you ? What a Mercy it was , Brother , that I did not hurt myself with the Fall ? Ay , Sister , said I , so it was ; but you have hurt your Husband , for he is got into Prison about it . Ay , says she , and seemed very much surprized . Elizabeth Hawtrey . I have been divers Times in the Room , and always - almost - found the Key in the Door . I eat and drank with her sometimes . I have clean 'd her Room , made her Bed , washed her and shifted her ; she had tolerable good Shifts ; and a Month afterwards , which was the Morning she got out of the Window , I found her without a Shift ; says I , why do you go so ? Because , says she , I ca n't bear a Shift . I have eat and drank with her many and many a Time , and have carried her up , Fish , Flesh , and Fowl , hot , and sat by her Bed-side while she eat it . She had a very good Stomach , and eat heartily , till latterly . I went up with Dr. Scurry , when he came to see her : He asked her how she did ? and said , it is a Mercy that you got no more Hurt when you fell out of the Window ; and she answer 'd , I know nothing of it . About 3 Months before her Fall , I would have taken her to keep at my House , and her Husband offered to give me 3 s. a Week , but she would not consent , and said , she would stay where she was . About a Year before her Fall , she went out , and said , she would go to her Kinsman , who owed her 100l . she staid a Fortnight , and then her Brother brought her home , and a Porter came with them with a Bundle . Her Brother desired the Prisoner to pay the Porter for bringing the Bundle , but he refus 'd till he saw what it was , and when it was opened , it was nothing but a Bundle of Rags . Corbet Vezey , the Prisoner 's Father . I have seen the Prisoner carry up hot Victuals from Dinner several times , both roast and boil 'd ; I have desired her to let me know if she wanted any thing , but she made no Complaint , and her Husband was not then with me . I have carry 'd her up Victuals myself , since she fell off the House . She was lock 'd up for robbing him , and carrying away his Trunk ; and other Things . William Parker . I often din 'd at the House , and always the Prisoner , or Elizabeth Finlow , carry 'd up a Place of Victuals , the same as we eat , and came down again without the Plate . I called one Sunday , and Elizabeth Finlow said to the Prisoner , Mr. Vezey , your Wife desires to see Mr. Parker . Did she ? says the Prisoner , then he shall go up . I went up and found a Plate of Victuals ; it was part of a Fillet of Veal , and boiled Bag Plumb-pudding . Says she , I think what I eat turns to Phlegm . Says I , can you eat any of this ? What is it , says she ? I ha n't look 'd on it yet . 'T is Veal and Pudding , says I ; then give it me , says she ; and so she eat the Pudding , but says she , I do n't care for the Meat now , set it down . Do you want any thing , says I ? No , says she , only I forgot to ask Mr. Finlow to spit in . I told Mrs. Finlow of it , and she she 'd go to Town on the Morrow , and buy some thing fit for that Use . This was about 5 Months , ago . I afterwards called on a Worky-day the Prisoner was gone to Bromley , and Mrs. Finlow was frying a couple of Mutton-chops ; is that your Father 's Dinner , says I ? No , Father 's gone out , 't is for Mr. Vezey ; for Dinner fell short to Day ; and then I saw her carry it up Stairs . Ann Vezey , the Prisoner 's Sister-in-law . I have din 'd at my Brother-in-law 's 2 or 3 Times Week and saw both him and my Sister Finlow carry up such Victuals as they eat themselves : I have been in her Room , and seen her eat till she left off , and have seen 3 or 4 Bottles of Beer there at a time Three Days after she fell off the House , I asked her , what Reason she had for doing so ? she said , she could not tell , but she was sorry that she had done it . Says I , did you want any thing ? No . never , says she , I always had both roast and boil 'd And when I told her of her Husband , she said , she did not know that she had said any thing against him . And indeed I never knew her make any Complaint . Sarah Skelton . I often dined at the House , and saw hot Victuals and warm Ale carried up several Times , and particularly one Time Mrs. Finlow carried up Veal and Bacon , and Greens , and I went up with her , and saw the Deceas 'd eat it ; and she had on a clean Shift and Mob , and very clean Sheets , and a good Bed . This was a Month before she got out of the Window . I have been up several Times , and seen a Bottle of Beer stand in the Chair by her Bed-side . Edward Hawtrey . I was there on the 21st of December , when Dr. Scurry went up ; I lighted him up Stairs ; the Room was not noisome ; she had on a black and white Crape-Gown , a Shift and a Cap . He said , How do you do ? she answered Indifferent , but should be better if I could see my Husband ; for I know not what I have done , that Justice Leake should send him to Prison . And the Doctor said , No-body can release him but you ; for it is the common Vogue that he has starved you . No , says she , I would not have you believe any such Thing , for I had hot Meat , both roast and boil 'd , every Day , or every other Day , as good as any Body could desire to eat . Mr. Dawson ask 'd her , if her Husband hung up the half-peck Loaf by a String ? and she said , No ; I did it myself to keep the Mice from eating it . I have often seen hot Meat , both roast and boil 'd , Fowls , and other Victuals sent up . Henry Dawson , Collector of the Tax at Mile-end . I went up with Dr. Scurry , only he and I , I told her , there was a Report that her Husband had tied a Loaf up out of her Reach ; she said , No , she hung it there herself to keep it from the Mice . She said , she should be glad if her Husband was out of Prison ; but I heard her say nothing about her Information before the Justice . Solomon Turkey . About 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon , on Sunday the 19th of December , I went up , and asked how she did ? she said , very well , considering her late Misfortune . Says I , why did you get upon the House ? and she answered , Sir , I desire you to ask no Questions ; for if I was to relate to you all the Actions of my Life , it would fill a Book that the World could not contain ; but all my Trouble is , that my Husband is in Trouble , and if I could but see him out , I did not care if the Lord would take me out of the World the next Moment . You seem to be much concerned at his Trouble , says I , but he would have had some , if you had made yourself away . No , says she , it would only have been the Char ge of paying the Coroner and Jury . But she said nothing that she had informed against him . Robert Osborn [ Osmond ] . I asked her if it was true that her Husband had starv 'd her ? she said , No , she had Bread and Cheese enough , and more than she could eat , and Meat 3 Times a Week . I asked her why her Husband confined her ? she said , there were Faults on both Sides : She heartily forgave him , and hoped God would forgive her . James Thurgill . I was the Prisoner 's Apprentice , and during my Time he kept a good House , with Fish , Flesh , and Fowl , and that was very well , you 'll say , for a working Man . His first Wife died 3 Days after my Time was out ; when he married the Deceas 'd he moved into Skinner-street , and they lived very happily at first , till he found Embezzlements , and then they begun to differ , and have Words . He had Information of a Trunk being carried away , which he got again . They were very much unsettled , he found more Embezzlements , and at last lock 'd her up , to hinder her from taking his Money . After she got out of the Window , I heard he was apprehended for starving her , and went to her on the 18th of December : I asked her how she did , and if she had wanted ? she answer 'd , No . I told her , I had heard him say that he had cut for her before he cut himself , and she said so he had . On the 26th of December I went again , and ask 'd her if the Bread was tied up by her or him ? she said , She tied it up herself to keep it from the Mice , and that she was sorry he was in Jail . But I heard her say nothing about her Information . Mary Hawtrey . I went up after her Fall , and asked her how she did ? she said , I thank God , indifferently , considering my Misfortune . How do you sleep ? says I , Very well , says she , but only I sometimes wake in a Fright with the Trouble about my Husband , since he has been in Prison ; but I do n't know what I have said to the Justice , that he has taken him out of the House , any more than the Child unborn . While I was there , Mr. Badily came up , and asked her how she did ? and she said , She did not know him . No ! says he , why , I am your Cousin Badily ; they say you have been starved . No , says she , it is no such thing , and I beg that you would not believe their Lies ; for I had the best of Butchers Meat , both roast and boil 'd , and Bread and Cheese , and small Beer ; but only within this Fortnight my Stomach would not bear it . Mr. Badily . I do n't remember that this Mary Hawtrey was there when I was , but I am certain the Deceas 'd said no such thing , but quite the reverse in every Respect ; for she told me , she had no such Victuals as she could eat , or that was fit for any Person in her Condition ; and that she wanted the common Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life . Mary Hawtrey , and Mrs. Dunbar took hold of the Deceas'd 's Hand , and said , You look better than when you came out of the Hospital . Yes , said she , I am better except my Fall . Mr. Badily . There was no such thing spoke in my hearing . A Juryman . Pray , my Lord , ask Elizabeth Finlow , if she was present when the Deceas 'd was examin 'd before the Justice . Elizabeth Finlow . No . Ann Clark . When Dr. Scurry was there , he ask 'd her why she throw 'd herself off of the House ? and she said , She knew not why : And he said , it was a barbarous Action , and Self-Murder . And somebody ask 'd if she was in her Senses ? and she said , Sometimes she was , and sometimes not . Then the Doctor ask 'd her about the Loaf , and she told him , she hung it there herself to keep the Mice from it . Mr. Scurry . Surgeon . I never ask 'd her why she throw 'd herself off of the House ; Mr. Dawson and I indeed enquir 'd about the Loaf , and she said she ty 'd it up her self , to keep the Mice from it . I went to see her the Day after her Fall , and found no Contusion or Fracture , or any thing like it . She had a Difficulty of breathing , and a Cough , attended with a great Spitting , an ill Habit of Body , was very weak and asthmatic , and prodigiously emaciated . I order 'd her Panada , and such kind of thin Diet . When I open 'd her , I perceiv 'd no inward Contusion , nor extravasated Blood . Upon opening the Thorax I found her Lungs much decay 'd , and an Adhesion on the Left Side . 'T is frequent to find an Adhesion , a Decay of the Lungs , and a general Waste , in Consumptions , for these are the common Symptoms . Court . Do you think you should have found such Symptoms in a consumptive Person who had lived well , and wanted no Necessaries ? Mr. Scurry . Yes . Mr. Coldkam ; Surgeon . I saw the Body of the Deceas 'd open 'd ; her Lungs were wasted and decay 'd , and adher 'd to the Left Side . I believe she dy 'd of an Asthma and Consumption . Court . If she had not been consumptive , but by being kept from the Air , and wanting proper Aliment had only been starved , would that have had the same Effect upon her Lungs ? Mr. Coldham . No , I believe not ; tho ' I never examin 'd the Body of a Person that dy 'd for Want . The Lungs might be entire , for tho ' the Body is emaciated , it does not follow that the Intestines must be corrupted . Mr. Mackenny , Surgeon . I examin 'd the Body with Mr. Scurry , and his Opinion agreed with mine , that she dy 'd of an Asthama . Mr. Scurry . I had heard the Report of her being starved , and asked her if it was true , she said she had Victuals , but complain 'd of her Consinement . Richard Chamberlain . I have known the Prisoner 7 or 8 Years , he was my Journeyman 5 Months , and he always discharged the Trust I reposed in him with Honour and Honestly , and I do n't know that he was inclined to Cruelty . Mary Chamberlain . I have known him 15 or 16 Years ; he was my Journeyman , and behav 'd himself with as much Honesty and Integrity as any I know . I saw nothing disagreeable in his Temper . I intended to put my Son Apprentice to him ; he lived well with his first Wife . Joseph Lemon . I have known him 16 or 17 Years , he was a mighty pretty , frank , free Man , without Fraction . There was a Report indeed that he had had several Bastards by the Woman of the House where he lodged , but I can say nothing to that , for I know nothing of it . Prisoner . I can call 50 more to my Character , but I will give the Court no farther Trouble . The Jury , after a few Minutes consideration , brought in their Verdict , Not Guilty ; and found , on the Coroner 's Inquisition , that Mary Vezey dy 'd ( by the Visitation of God ) of an Asthma . 14. George Scroggs , of Tottenham , was indicted for assaulting Charles Bellinger , Clerk , in an open Place , near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Gold-Ring with a Cornelian-Seal , value 10 s. 1 Silk Purse , value 1 d. and 3 s. and 6 d. in Money , on the 14th of February last . Charles Bellinger . I am Curate of Tottenham-Church . On Sunday the 14th of February last , about 10 in the Morning , as I was going from my House to the Church , in a publick Way , about a Quarter of a Mile from the Church , and a 100 Yards from the Houses , I was stopp 'd by the Prisoner , who came out of a Lane Parallel with the Road .
