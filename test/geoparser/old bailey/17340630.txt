William Dun . I keep a Barber's-Shop on London-Bridge . The Wig was Edw Bright 's , I sold it him for 5 l. sometime ago . Thomas Seymour . About 12 on Saturday Night , having just let a Customer out , I was going to sweep the Shop , and my Back being turn 'd , I thought I heard some Body behind me , upon which I look 'd , but seeing no Body in the Shop , I ran to the Door , and took the Prisoner , with the Wig-box in his Hand , but the Wig was taken out . I know the Wig was in it a few Minutes before , for I put it in myself , and set it on the Shelf ; and I knew the Box , because I myself had writ Mr . Bright 's Name on it . The Prisoner said , he found the Box at the Door . Richard Casely , alias Cock-my-Chin . The Prisoners and I , had been a stealing Oil that Night , at the Old-Swan . We got two Kettles full , and sold it to John Gill , a Hempdresser , in Bridewell-Alley , and then going over London-Bridge , we saw Mr. Dun 's Shop open . Stay , says Jack Jones , I 'll go and get something . So we staid at the Door , and he went in , and brought out a Wig in a Box ; I took the Wig , and put it into my Bosom , and the Man came out , and seiz 'd Jack . His Mother seeing this , bid me follow her to Plumb-pudding-Square on London-Bridge . So she ran away , and I ran after her to Plumb-pudding-Square , and gave her the Wig . She ask 'd me to go home with her , but I refus 'd , and went and took up my Lodging on the Pipes , that belong to the Water-house at the Bridge . The Watch found me there , and carry 'd me to the Constable , he threaten 'd to send me to Bridewell for a Black-guard ; but I promis 'd never to lie there any more , and so he let me go . On Sunday Morning I heard , that Jack was in the Poultry-Compter , I borrow 'd 6 d. of the Hempman , and went to Jack , and gave him , 2 d. - On Tuesday I went to Lingard 's Gin-shop in the Mint , where the Wig was pawn 'd for 17 s. I ask 'd for some Money , but Mrs. Lingard kick 'd me out of Doors . Then I met Jack Baldwin , and another Black-Shoe-Boy , eating a Marrow-bone , I ask 'd them to give me a bit , for I was very hungry ; but they said , there was 2 Guineas bid for taking me up , and so they got a Constable and took me . Elizabeth Jones . I was not with them that Saturday Night , for having been hard at Work all Day , I went home to Bed . And next Morning , as I was cleaning Shoes , I saw the Evidence , and ask 'd him where my Son was ? He damn 'd me for a Bitch , and said , my Son had stole his Blacking-pot - A Porter afterwards told me , my Son was in the Compter . John Jones . I own I was with the Evidence at the Old-Swan , but left him there , and went with the Kettle of Stuff to the Hempman 's , and when I came back , I found the Wig-box at the Barber 's Door - Yesterday a Woman brought me 2 d. for some Victuals , and said , she saw the Evidence , and that he had told her , he swore against my Mother only because she abus 'd him on Sunday - Cock-my-Chin . It was you that draw 'd me away when I liv 'd at Mrs. Bradley 's , in Pudding-Lane , where I had a Shilling a Week for cleaning Shoes - I know all the Butchers in East-cheap , and they can give me a Character . The Jury acquitted Elizabeth Jones , and found John Jones Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 3. John Ford , was indicted for stealing a Gown and Petticoat , val . 3 l. the Goods of Elizabeth Sheppard , in the House of John Gullender , April 24 . Acquitted . 4. Joseph Greenfield , was indicted for the Murder of John Jones , by beating and kicking him on the Breast , Stomach , and privy Members , and thereby giving him , on the 22d of May , several mortal Bruises , of which he languish 'd 'till the 25th of the same Month , and then dyed . He was a second Time indicted , on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for Manslaughter . Two Men quarrel 'd about a Bett of 2 d. laid in a Nine-pin-Ground , in Hampstead . The Deceas 'd took the part of him who lost the Bett , a fourth Man began to quarrel with the Deceas 'd , but was call 'd away . Then the Deceas 'd said , he 'd fight any Man for a Crown . The Prisoner , who was a Stranger to him , began to strip ; but said he had not a Crown to venture , and so the Deceas 'd and he agreed to fight for Love , as they call 'd it . They boxt fairly ; the Deceas 'd had the better , and the Prisoner said he would fight no more , in the Nine-pin-Ground among Black-guards ; but would fight it out in a Room . The Deceas 'd was for having it out in the Ground . Then the Prisoner clapp 'd him on the Back , and call 'd him a good Lad . They shook Hand three times very lovingly , and went to boxing again . The Prisoner struck the Deceas 'd upon the Temples , which made him stagger , and as he was falling the Prisoner kick 'd him on the Breast and the Groin , and he fell down , and lay for dead ; but he was brought a little to himself in about half an Hour . This was on a Wednesday , and he dyed on the Saturday following . Prisoner . I never saw the Deceas 'd before that time , and I had no quarrel with him then , but he challeng 'd me , and we fought for Love . I gave him a knock on the Head which made him reel , and then I went to kick up his Heels , but with no Design to kick him on the Breast or the Groin . The Prisoner had the Character of a quiet peaceable Man , whether drunk or sober . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 5. Thomas Taverner , alias Cotton , was indicted for assaulting Mary , the Wife of Samuel Russel , on the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Silk-purse , 2 Gold-rings , and 2 s. Jan. 2 . Mrs. Russel . About 4 in the Afternoon , going from Islington , to Newington , Green , my Chariot was stopt near the Turnpike , by two Men on Horseback , One of them came up , on a whitish Horse but very dirty , to the Chariot Door , with a Pistol , and said , Damn you , deliver ! - be quick - Your Purse , your Money , your Rings ! I was much surpriz 'd , and said , Do n't frighten me , and I 'll give you all . I gave him my Purse , he pull 'd off my Glove , and took 2 Rings , one , which was a Mourning-ring , he pull 'd off , and I think , I gave him the other . I desir 'd him to return me a Key , that was in the Purse , but he damn 'd me , and rode off . My Coachman drove to the Turnpike , and then desir 'd me to let him take one of the Horses , and pursue the Highwayman . I gave him leave , and he follow 'd them , and they were both taken that Night . But some , who took the Prisoner , let him go again . I verily believe the Man who robb 'd me was the Prisoner . He was as like him as possible and such Clothes as the Prisoner has now , but I can not swear positively . Prisoner . What 's become of the other Person who was taken ? Mrs. Russel . I hear that he is gone to Sea . Prisoner . How could he be discharged , when he confest the Fact , and I was taken at Bristol ? Mrs. Russel . The Man the Prisoner speaks of , was Robert Morpeth who was taken for this Robbery , and made an Evidence * . The Prisoner being taken at Bristol I went to Morpeth 's Father , and asked him where his Son was , for I wanted him to be an Evidence ? He said his Son was discharged and gone to Sea . * In January last , against William Byrom for stealing a Silver-Cup , but Byrom was Acquitted . Session Paper . Numb . 2. p. 53 . Prisoner . That was because his Father was rich , for he convicted Nobody . Mr. Justice Booth . The Prisoner being taken at Holloway , some of his Friends let him slip away . Next Morning I went with Joseph Collins to Morpeth , in New-Prison , to enquire for a Family-Ring , which was taken from Mrs. Russel , and Morpeth deliver 'd it to Collin 's ( who had been Servant to Mr. Russel ) and confest that he and the Prisoner - Court . His Confession is no Evidence against the Prisoner - How came Morpeth to be discharged ? Mr. Booth . After he had been an Evidence he was referr 'd to me and Justice Harvey to be discharged , if there was no farther Prosecution . We waited till the next Sessions and a Month after , and no Prosecution then appearing he was according discharged . William Ward ( the Prosecutor 's Coachman . ) A little on this side the Turnpike that goes to Newington-Green , I saw the Prisoner and another coming through the Turnpike , they past the Chariot and turn 'd short and said , Damn you stop ! But not stoping immediately , the Prisoner cry 'd , Damn your Body and Soul , stop or I 'll shoot you this Minute He had a Pistol in his Hand . I stop 'd , and he went to the Chariot-door to my Mistress , and another Lady who was with her , and Damn 'd their Bloods for a Couple of Bitches , bid them deliver their Watches . They said they had none . Then he demanded their Money and Rings , and I saw him take a Ring off my Mistresses 's Finger . The other Rogue was then on the Off-side of the Chariot . They rid away together towards Islington , and I drove to the Turnpike , took one of the Horses , and rais 'd an Hue and Cry , and pursued them to Holloway , where they parted . One of them went towards Highgate , and was follow 'd by some of the Company . The Prisoner quitted his Horse , ran down a Lane , and got into a Field . I dismounted too , and pursued him - One of the Company leap 'd the Hedge with his Horse , and rode up to the Prisoner who offer 'd a a Pistol at him , but another came behind the Prisoner , and pull 'd him backwards . My Horse being left in the Lane with another Horse , they fell a Kicking one another ; and the Prisoner being seiz 'd , I went to take care of my Horse , and in the mean time those who had got the Prisoner let him slip away , for it seems they were acquainted with him - I am positive that he is the Man , and I pick 'd him out among several in Newgate - He had brown Clothes , and his Horse was a White Grey , but very dirty . Thomas Ogle . As I and 3 or 4 more were binding Hay at Holloway , we heard the Hue and Cry , and saw the Prisoner ride down the Lane between Mother Red-Cap 's and the Castle , and Ward follow 'd him . The Prisoner quitted his Horse , ran through a great Slough , and got over the Hedge into the Field . We ran to assist , and the Gentleman being unwilling to ride through the Slough , put me upon his Horse and I leap 'd the Hedge and came up with the Prisoner . He drew a Pistol and offer 'd to fire at me , but another Gentleman came behind him and pull 'd him backwards , and the Pistol fell out of his Hand . Then I laid hold of his Pistol , and Ward was the next Man who came up . Ward 's Horse quarrelling with another , in the Lane , he ran to part them , and I follow 'd to assist him , and as I return 'd I met 20 or 30 of them in a Body , and they said the Prisoner was gone . Court . And why did not you pursue him again ? Ogle . I was then a Field off , and when I found the Pistol loaded , I was frighted , considering how I had hazarded my Life . Court . But the Danger was over when you had got the Pistol ? Ogle . But they did not care to follow him , for some of them knew him ? Court . Did you know him . Ogle . I had seen him often . Prisoner . What Clothes had I. Ogle . Brown . Prisoner . By what Particular do ye know me to be the Person ? Ogle . As he lay on his Back , I saw some Scars in his Throat . Court . See if you can find such Marks now . Ogle . ( Going to the Prisoner . ) Yes - Here is the same . Thomas Hodgkin . On the 11 of February , I met the Prisoner , and 5 others in Bristol ; and as I knew him , and had seen an Advertisement that he was concern 'd in the Robbery by Newington , I got assistance , and dogg 'd them to a Place call 'd the Castle , where we took the Prisoner , and carried him before the Mayor , who sent him to Newgate . Prisoner . I was sick a Bed when the Robbery was committed . Frances Lee . The Prisoner kept an Alehouse in Swan-Alley , but failing there , he came to lodge at my House in Pear-Tree-street , in Brick-lane , and kept up close , for Fear of being arrested . He came a Month before the Robbery , and staid with me 5 Months ; and then he went to Bristol in order to go to Dublin . Court . But did he never go out ? Lee . Yes , now and then , privately - And he was a Week at Mrs. Pinnock 's , at Islington , but I went to him every Day with Victuals . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 6.

Mrs. Fleet . The Prisoner was my Servant . He had lived with me 2 Months . On Tuesday Morning , the 19th of March , my Bureau ( which stands in Mr. Thornbury 's Dressing-room , on the first Floor ) was broke , the Back-doors of my House left open , and the Prisoner was not to be found . Court . What did you lose Madam ? Mrs. Fleet . A Table-cloth out of the Kitchen , but I know not what Money was taken out of my Bureau . For Mr. Thornbury who is my Relation , receives my Rents for me , and he had put some of my Money there , and I had not settled with him since he receiv 'd it . Mr. Thornbury . About 12 at Night , the Prisoner as usual undrest me in my Dressing-room where the Bureau stood , and he put my silver Buckles in his Pocket to clean them next Morning as I thought , but about 7 in the Morning I heard he was gone . As I did not think he had taken any thing with him but his Livery and my Buckles , I only said Let him go - he 's a sorry Fellow . But going into my Dressing room , I found the Bureau was broke open and mist 27 l. 14 s. 6 d. of Mrs. Fleet 's Money , and 23 l. the Money of John Bateman the Coachman , who had desir 'd me to lay it up for him . I was afraid some Bank-Notes were gone too . But opening a Book I had put them in , I found them all safe . We went to the Cheshire-Cheese in Arundel-street where the Prisoner had lodg 'd ; we heard he had hired a Horse of Mr. Child behind St-Clement's-Church , and had changed his Livery . I got a 1000 Advertisements printed , describ 'd the Prisoner and his Horse , and put them in the Post-Office to be sent all over England . On Friday the Horse was return 'd to Mr. Child , and he told me he had heard the Prisoner was at Huntington . I sent Mr. Child Post after him , and he return 'd on Saturday Night , and said the Prisoner was taken with 41l . and my Buckles upon him , and committed to Huntington Goal . Here 's the Money and Buckles seal 'd up in this Bag . John Child . I had been out of Town , and when I return 'd , my Partner told me , he had let a Horse to the Prisoner . In the Evening Madam Fleet 's Servant came to enquire if the Prisoner had hired a Horse . I said Yes . They told me he had committed a Robbery . 3 Days after this the York Coachman brought back my Horse . I told him what had happen 'd , and he said he had left the Prisoner at Stevenage ; and if I took Post I might get to Huntington before the Coach went out . I accordingly took Post Horses at Mid night , and came to Huntington by 7 in the Morning ; but the York Coach was gone . I and the Landlord follow , and at the End of 6 Miles overtook it , and seiz 'd the Prisoner . I ask 'd him how he came to rob his Mistress . He said he had done it , and could not help it . I found 2 Guineas , half a Moidore , and some Silver , in his Pocket , and he said it was his Mistresses 's Money and that the rest was in his Cloak-bag . I search 'd the Cloak-bag , and found 7 pair of Stockings , some Linnen , a pair of silver Buckles , 12 Moidores , 11 Guineas , and 3 Portugal Pieces of 3 l. 12 s. each . I carried him before Justice Forkington , at Huntington , where he made a Confession , and afterwards he wrote this Letter , ( I saw him write part of it ) to his Mistress , and I carried it to her , at her House in Great-James-street in Bedford-Row . Then the Letter was read . He therein says , he has confest all before the Justice , and begs Pardon of his Mistress , acknowledges that he had receiv 'd her Pardon once before ; but his fellow Servants twitting him with it ; that put him upon Robbing her and running away . His Confession being prov 'd , was likewise read in Court .

When Mr. Child took me , he said if I 'd own the Fact , my Mrs. would take me into her Service again , and I being in Confusion and Light-headed , by means of a late Feaver , I did not know what I said or sign 'd , but I remember that Mr. Child Pick 'd my Pocket .

As I was changing a Guinea , for a Customer , the Prisoner came in , and desir 'd me to change her Guinea too , for she said , she wanted Sugar and Plumbs I saw she had Silver and Halfpence in one Hand , and told her , she had more Silver than would pay for what she wanted ; but she said , she had occasion for more Silver . I had some Silver and Gold in a Paper . I told her I had never a half Guinea , and with that , she thrust her Hand among the Money , and said , Here 's a half Guinea ; and here 's another . I ask 'd her , What she meant by that ? And catching hold of her Hand , I took two Guineas out of it , and then bid her go about her Business , for I would change no Money for her . Well , says she , give me my Guinea again . I told her , I had no Guinea of hers . Yes , says she , but you have , for one of these you took out of my Hand was mine . I told her , I knew what was in the Paper , for it was set down , and if I found a Guinea too much , she should have it . I cast up the Money , and miss 'd some , but being a little in a Fluster , I could not exactly tell how much . It 's hard , says she , that I should lose my Guinea , and so she went away very quietly . A Friend of mine , who was in the Shop , said he believ 'd she had got something , or she would not have gone away so easy , and so he went and brought her back . I was now a little more cool , and cast up the Money more carefully , and found I wanted 20 s. or a Guinea , tho ' I reckon 'd the two Guineas I had taken out of her Hand , and so I call 'd a Constable . Zacheus Bourn , Constable . The Prisoner offer 'd to make up the Guinea , if he would not prosecute her . The Prisoner said nothing in her Defence , but that her Husband was a Soldier at Ware , in Col. Paget 's Regiment . The Jury acquitted her . 16.

Mr. Hague . The Prisoner was my Servant , in January and February last . I went into Lancashire , and as soon as I return 'd , I heard he had robb 'd me of a thousand Pounds in Cash and Notes , * and that the next Day one Cox , a Portugueze Priest , had brought back some Money and Notes , to the value of above 800 l. I got Advertisements printed , and sent them to the Post-Office - A Gentleman at Bath , wrote me word that he had accidentally met with the Prisoner there , and apprehended him , but advis 'd me to send down some Body to swear to him , for he had made so many Friends , by his gay Appearance and extravagant Expences , that otherwise it would be difficult to hold him . * Then the whole of the sum is not charged in the Indictment Council . Were not all your Notes brought back ? Mr. Hague . I had them all again , except one for 60 l. which was an old and , and not much worth , but besides that , I am 67 l. 6 s. out of Pocket . Council . Did you never apply to the Prisoner 's Mother to make you Satisfaction ? Mr. Hague . She offer 'd to make the Matter easy ; but I told her , she had deceived the Gentleman who recommended her son to me , for he had robb 'd his former Master , and had been 4 Years in Town , tho ' he pretended he had been come but a few weeks from Portugal . Samuel Touchet . On Sunday , March 3 , I left the Prisoner a Bed , and went out . I return 'd before Sermon time , designing to dress myself , and go to Church ; but I missing two Shirts , and my Hat , and Wig , and looking about , I found two of the Cash-drawers under the Sink : Upon which I called the Maid , and then went and fetch 'd home our Man , who unlock 'd the Desk , and found that all the Drawers had been taken out and plunder 'd . Richard Ford , who took the Prisoner at Bath , brought me my Wig , and one of my Shirts . Holden Bouker . On Sunday Morning I went out to dine , but was called home by Sam Touchet , who said , that he had found two of the Cash-drawers under the Shew-board . The Desk is double and there are three Drawers on each side . I found the Flaps lock 'd fast , but upon opening them , there was neither Bill nor Money . I ask 'd the Maid where the Prisoner was . She said he went out about 9 a Clock in a hurry , and said , he must be at 9 a Clock Prayers , and would come home at half an Hour past 12 . I thought to go and see for him , at the Portugueze Chappel , but considering it was almost his time to return , I waited 'till 1 a Clock , and hearing nothing of him then , I sent Touchet to enquire of the Gentleman who recommended the Prisoner , and went myself to the Water-side , where I heard that some such Person was gone off in the Gravesend-Boat . I immediately got a Post-horse , and arriv 'd at Gravesend before the Boat ; but when it came in , he was not among the Passengers . So I left a Description of him , and return 'd , concluding he was still in Town . I desir 'd one to lie at the Water-side , and I myself lay at the Post-house ; but the Prisoner came to neither Place . Next Morning , being Monday , I went to all the Persons who were concern 'd in the Notes , to let them know the Notes were stoln I return 'd at Noon , and found our People at home look 'd much pleasanter . They told me , the Portugueze Ambassador 's Priest had brought cash and Notes , to the value of 854 l. 14 s. They said , they did not think it safe to stop him - He was one who had recommended the Prisoner . On Thursday , I heard that the Prisoner had been at Brentford , and hir 'd a Horse for Windsor . I went to Brentford , and found the Man who left him the Horse ; he was under no concern about losing his Horse , for he said , the Prisoner had left 7 l. for Security , and was gone to Windsor , to meet the Prince of Orange . I return 'd home , and got 500 Advertisements printed , and left them at the Post-Office , to be spread in England and Ireland . Next Wednesday a Letter came from Mr. Ford , at Bath , advising , that on seeing the Advertisement he had stopt the Prisoner . Mr. Hague . The Prisoner likewise sent me a Letter from Bath , and another from Ilchester - I have them both here - This is that from Bath - I know it to be the Prisoner 's Writing . Then the Letter was read . It was directed , To Joseph Hague , at the Star , in Castle-Court , near Lawrence-Lane , and dated March 23 , 1733 . The Prisoner therein declares , that his Remorse pursues him so , that he can not enjoy any part of Pleasure , he had promised himself - Confesses the Robbery - Begs Forgiveness , and says , that in great Confusion he left the Bills , and some Money , with Anthony Campion , desiring him to return them . Mr. Hague . My People told me , that the Priest , who brought the Money and Notes , said , that he had them from Campion . H. Boucker . On the Receit of these Letters , I went to Bath , where I found the Prisoner . He said , he had premeditated the Robbery for several Weeks ; that he open 'd the Desk , and took out the Notes , and about 80 l. in Cash , and then went to the Portugueze Chappel , where he met Campion , went with him into the Park , and told him what he had done ; they walk 'd thro ' Kensington towards Chiswick . He gave Campion the Notes , and 25 l. in Cash , and Campion advis 'd him to go to Brentford , and write to him by the Name of William Falkner ; then they parted . He went to Brentford , where he hir 'd a Horse , and rode thro ' Windsor to Reading , where he bought a Whip , silk Stockings , and a Lace for his Hat . Thence he went to Oxford , and so to Bath , where he was taken . Here is his Confession , before the Mayor and Justices at Bath . [ The Confession being prov 'd was read in Court . ] He herein confesses , that he took the Money and Notes out of the Desk , that he gave the Notes , and 25 l. to Campion , desiring him to return them to Mr. Hague . that he took Horse at Brentford , and rode to Oxford , and from tence to Bath , where he was taken with 21 l. upon him , which was all he had left of his Master 's Money , having bought new Clothes , a Wig , Boots , and some other Things , besides having his Pocket pick 'd by a Whore at Oxford . Boker . After this Confession , he was committed to Ilchester Goal . Council . Do you know of no Reward , that your Master has receiv 'd from the Prisoner 's Mother , for making this Matter up ? Bouker . No ; they offer 'd me a Bond , but I would have nothing to do with it . Council . Do you know of any Money , Note or Bond given to William Havers ? Bouker . No . Council . Was Havers never employ 'd by your Master ? Bouker . Not that I know of . Mr. Ford . I found the Prisoner at a Coffee-house , in Bath , in Company with a Person . I got a Constable , and charged the Prisoner with the Fact . He at first deny 'd it stiffly ; but when I shew 'd him the Advertisement , he said , sighing , It signifies nothing to equivocate ; I am the Man . Anthony Campion . On Sunday Morning , between 9 and 10 , the Prisoner came to the Portugueze Chappel , and beckon 'd me out . We went to Hyde-Park Corner , where he told me , he had robb 'd his Master of Money and Notes , and bid me take the Notes , and scatter them at t'other End of the Town , and then he said , some Body that found 'em might be taken up , and so he should escape the better - We walked towards Chiswick , and then he gave me 25 l. and so we parted , and I deliver 'd the Notes and Money , to Mr. Cox , to return to Mr. Hague . Mrs. Barker , the Prisoner 's Mother . Mr. Ross , who is Mr. Hague 's Friend , came to me , and said , if I 'd give 30 l. the Affair should be accommodated . My Husband went to give Security for the Money ; but Mr. Hague told me , if I placed 20 l. in a Friend 's Hands , something might be done - I lodg 'd the Money in Mr. Havers 's Hands , and afterwards put 5 l. more to it by Mr. Ross 's Orders , and Mr. Hague told me he 'd stand by what Mr. Ross did . Mr. Hague . I never told her so . Mrs. Barker . You did ; and you said if I did not comply , you should have a Benefit Ticket . Mr. Hague . I said no such thing . Mrs. Barker . My Son is about 19 Years old . He told me that Campion was the first that drew him aside , for Campion kept a School , and having marry 'd against his Friends Consent , he was in great Distress - Campion and Cox , the Priest , were examin 'd before Justice Lambert , who committed Campion to the Gatehouse , for this very Fact , and Mr. Hague was present then ; and bound over to prosecute him . Mr. Hague . I know nothing of his Commitment . Mrs. Barker . No ? - Here 's the Copy of his Commitment ! Mr. Hague . Then that must have been at his second Appearance , for I am sure there was no Commitment at the first . Mrs. Barker . Campion confess 'd the Fact before the Justice . Court . Did you hear that ? Mrs. Barker . No ; for when the Justice took his Confession , they turn 'd me out . Court . And will you swear to what was done in your Absence ? Mrs. Barker . Campion lay in the Gatehouse 'till last Sessions , and then he was discharged . Louisa Giles . The Wednesday after the Prisoner was taken , I went , with Mrs. Barker , to Mr. Ross 's , and Mr. Hague was there . Mr. Barker , the Prisoner 's Father-in-Law , was to give a Bond of 30 l. and Mr. Hague agreed to it ; for Mr. Ross , said , Must I make it for thirty Pound ? And Mr. Hague said , Yes . And he bid me agree with Mr. Ross , for , says he , If you make it easy with him , I shall be easy . Mrs. Barker . And Ross said , Down with your ready Rhino . Mr. Hague . I know Ross was very eager to make it up , but I gave him no Instructions , for I always said , I would have nothing to do with it . Judith Walker . I went to Mr. Hague 's , and he said , Do n't talk to me , but go to Mr. Ross , and what he does , I will stand to . And Ross came to Mrs. Barker 's , and said , If you 'll place 30 l. there shall be no more of this Affair . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . 17. John Campbell , was indicted for stealing a Shirt , the Goods of Michael Pattey , May 1 . Elizabeth Pattey . I was washing my Husband 's Shirt at the Sun Alehouse , and when I had given it a Lather , I left it in the Tub ; and the Prisoner , and one Anderson , came in to drink , and when they were gone , I miss 'd the Shirt . So I went to look for the Prisoner , and found him standing at the Angel Door , in Maid-Lane , in Wood-Street . His Breeches stood wide open , and there was a great Bulk strutted out , as big as my Fist . I clapp 'd fast hold on it with my Hand , and said , This is mine , you Rogue ! Court . But how did you know it was yours ? Pattey . By the Condition it was in , for I felt it all wet , and I had lather 'd it but a little before . Then he bid me let go , and step over to his Lodging , and he would endeavour to satisfy me . So I went with him into a Passage , on t'other side of the Way , and there he dropt the Shirt - I did not see him drop it , but a Boy came and took it up . Thomas Hester . I went with Mrs. Pattey to look for the Prisoner , we found him standing at the Angel Alehouse Door , and a Shirt stuck 5 or 6 Inches out of his Breeches . She catch 'd hold of it , and said , You Villain , here it is - This is mine . I saw it was in a wet Condition , and she said , she had just given it a Lather . He pull 'd it out of her Hand , and bid her go over the Way , and he 'd make her easy . So we went into the Passage , and as we were standing together ( no Body being there but she , and I , and the Prisoner ) a Boy came by , and pick 'd up the Shirt . Prisoner . I went to drink with a Friend , at the Sun , and two Men there quarrell 'd with my Friend , and therefore I desir 'd him to come away . I went myself to the Door , and stay 'd for him 4 or 5 Minutes ; but he not coming , I went without him . Two or three Hours after , this Woman met me , and ran her Hand into my Breeches , and said , I had got her Shirt there . I told her , I had nothing there but what was my own , and if she would go to my Lodging , I would convince her of it , and so as we were going a Boy found a Shirt . Several appearing to the Prisoner 's Character , the Jury acquitted him . 18. Mary Hanson , was indicted for stealing a Sheet and a Curtain , the Goods of Henry Brown . No Evidence . Acquitted . 19. Edward Ballance , was indicted for stealing a Watch-Case , val . 9s . the Property of John Parks , May 17 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 20. William Ray , was indicted for the Murder of Mary , his Wife , was indicted for the Murder of Mary , his Wife , by giving her several mortal Wounds and Bruises , on her Head , Face , Eyes , Breast , and Stomach , April 29 ; of which Wounds , and Bruises , she languish 'd 'till the 4th of May , and then dyed . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the said Murder . Eliz Adger . On Tuesday I went to the Prisoner 's Shop , the Corner of Lincolns-Inn-Fields , for a Dram , and his Wife ( the Deceas 'd ) was lying upon some Straw behind the Counter . How do you do , Mrs. Ray ? Says I . She made me no Answer ; but the Prisoner 's Mother said , she was very ill. Aye , says the Prisoner , She has got a Black Eye . How came she by it ? says I . Why , says he , I gave it her accidentally . I think you are always giving her black Eyes , says I . But this was her own Fault , says he ; for Yesterday , while I was gone out with two Gallons of Brandy , Sam Badham and another+ came in to drink , and that other Man struck my Wife on the Breast . I coming home before he was gone , my Wife said will you see me murder 'd ? And upon that I knock 'd him down , but she going to take his Part , I happen 'd to give her a black Eye - I went next Day , When the Prisoner said , his Mother ( Mrs. Ray ) had fetch 'd his Wife away in a Chair to her House in Eagle-street ; so I went to see her there . She was lying upon the Bed in a loose Gown . She had a terrible black Eye , and as I kneel 'd by the Bed-side , she said , as plain as she could speak - I am kill 'd - I am murder 'd ! This was all I could understand , for she had got a great faultring in her Speech by the Hurt she had receiv 'd . The Prisoner coming into the Room I held her up and begg 'd her to kiss him ; she kiss 'd me , but she slid her Head away from him - Three Weeks before this I saw her at the Shop , and the Prisoner was there too . I ask 'd her how she did . Do ? says she , bad enough - See how this Rogue kills me and cuts me to Pieces - See how he has cut my Gown - and see what a Condition my Arms are in . And indeed her Arms were black and blue . So I spent 6 Pence to make them Friends again , by the same Token that I scor 'd it up , and have not paid it yet - * Stephen Farmer . These two Men were committed to Newgate , on the Oath of the Prisoner , for murdering his Wife . They were both discharg 'd at the Goal-Delivery . Ann Jones . On Monday , April 29. as I was standing at Mr. Banks 's Door , which faces the Prisoner 's Shop , I heard a great Noise , and looking , I saw the Prisoner beating his Wife ; there was no Soul but they two in the Shop ; with his Fist clenched thus - he gave her a violent Blow on the Breast . She cry 'd , Murder ! And then he gave her another Blow on the Chest , which knock 'd her down . The Mob gathering , I went over to my own Door , which is next to the Prisoner 's . He came out and asked them what they wanted ? Then he went in , and shut the Door . By and by he came out again , and went over to the Alehouse ( Mr. Cary 's ) and call 'd for a Pint of Beer - On Tuesday she was very ill. On Wednesday she was carried to his Mother 's , at a Farrier 's Shop in Eagle-street , and on Saturday she dy 'd - I have often seen him beat her before this , and seen her Arms as black as this Coat , and she has frequently said he was a Murdering Thieving Dog , and that she dy 'd by Inches . In particular , six Weeks before the last Quarrel , I got up between 3 and 4 in the Morning , to burn Cork ( for I keep a Cork-Shop ; ) I went to light a Candle , and found the Deceas 'd drest vastly clean , and leaning on the Counter . I was surpriz 'd to see her drest so soon . She wink 'd upon me , and said she had been at a Labour . I laught , and told her , when I went to a Labour , I never return 'd so soon . She wink 'd again , and ask 'd me to give her Hansel . So I laid out a Penny with her , and went to burn my Cork ; which I did by the dead Wall . She came to me there , and said , What do ye think ? My Rogue has laid a Pen-knife behind the Counter where we lye , and swore he would cut my Throat , if I did not get up directly . He beats and pinches me so , that I dye by Inches . Sarah Fosbrook . I live at Mr. Griffin 's , opposite to the Prisoner 's . On Monday April 29 , in the Afternoon , I heard a Quarrel in the Prisoner 's Shop , but that being a usual Thing , I did not much mind it . The Prisoner came out , and went over to the Alehouse , and in a little time , his Wife follow 'd , and said , You Dog ! You Villain ! You private murdering Rogue ! I 'll skreen you no longer , for the World shall know what a Rogue you are . This was confirm 'd by Elizabeth Martin , who added , That about 8 or 9 on a Saturday Night , 6 Weeks before the last Quarrel , she heard the Deceas 'd cry Murder ! and a Soldier coming by push 'd open the Door , upon which the Prisoner said to him , Damn your Blood , you Son of a Bitch , are you come to rob me ? An Beldam . One Morning I call 'd for a Dram , and said , How d 'ye do , Mrs. Ray ? I ca n't do well , says she , when I have got such a Rogue of a Husband . Her Arm was as black as a Hat , and so was her Thigh , for she took up her Clothes and shew 'd me - such an Arm , and such a Thigh , I never saw in my Days ! Lauk a dazy ! says I , what have you married ? A Rogue ! says she , a private Rogue ! I dye by Inches - But I see him coming over the Field ; for God 's sake , take no Notice , for I shall be kill 'd , if you do . John Smallman , Watchman . About 3 Weeks before her Death , as I was calling the Hour of 11 , I heard Murder cry 'd , and went in ; she charged me to carry her Husband before the Constable ; and said , If I did not , she should be murder 'd ; and while I was there , he threw a Candlestick at her . I endeavour 'd to pacify them ; but he call 'd me , Old Son of a Bitch , and swore he 'd knock my Head off - Five Nights after , I found him beating at his own Door between 1 and 2 in the Morning to get in , and I heard her ask him , if she must let him in to murder her ? Says I , Why do you disturb the Neighbours ? Damn the Neighbours , says he , and you too . And so I left him - His Brother threatens to murder me , if he should be hang 'd . William Fitzgerald , Surgeon . I assisted Mr. Broomfield , in opening the Body of the Deceas 'd ; there was a large livid Spek on the Eye-lid ; under the Eye , I made an incision , and found no extravasated Blood , but only an aqueous Humour , more than usual issued from the Eye . I perceiv 'd no Contusion in the Head , but there was a large briuse on her Arm , and another on her Breast , 4 Inches broad , and it was as black as my Hat . We open 'd the Thorax ; the Breast-bone , and Pectoral Muscles on each Side were much bruised , but nothing was amiss in the Heart . Then we open 'd the Abdomen , and found a large Adhesion of the Lungs to the Pleura . The Liver was much swell 'd , and the Largeness of it had thrust up the Disphragma , so that the Lungs had not room to play . Court . Do you think those Bruises were Mortal ? Mr. Fitzhenry . Such violent bruises often produce Feavers , which prove Fatal . Mr. Bromfield . The other Surgeon spoke to the same effect . The Prisoner 's Defence . Sarah Ward . I went for a Dram the Day after she was beat . She lay under the Counter , I ask 'd her how she did ? She said , Very ill . The Prisoner her Husband said a Man came into the Shop and beat her , and gave her a black-Eye . I hope , says I , you did not do it . No , says he , God forbid ! I would not do such a thing for the World . Aye , says she , that 's true , for the Man call 'd for Liquor , and would not pay me ; but if my Husband had been here then , it had been prevented - I never saw him quarrel with her in my Life . Mary Wright . I was at her Mother 's House , when she was brought in . I never heard her say a Word . The Prisoner came three times there to see her , but not a Word past between 'em . She had violent Convulsion Fits , and died in one . Mr. Fitzhenry , Apothecary . On Thursday Night , the 2d of May , the Prisoner sent for me , and said his Wife was very ill at his Mother 's , beg 'd me to do what I could , and he 'd honestly pay me - I went - She had strong Convulsions , attended with a Fever ; her Eye was very black ; she endeavour 'd to speak , but could not . I propos 'd Blisters between her Shoulders and on her Ams ; but a Woman ( who seemed to belong to the House ) objected to the Blisters on her Arms , tho ' I know not why , and so there was only one Blister put on between her Shoulders . Next Morning she was better , and somebody said she had spoke ; but in the Afternoon she grew worse , and on Saturday I heard she was dead - I ca n't pretend to say what was the Cause of her Convulsions . Court . Are Bruises apt to produce Convulsions , or Fevers ? Mr. Fitzhenry . The least Inflammation of the Blood may sometimes have such Effects . Ann Ray , ( the Prisoner 's Sister . ) The Deceas 'd was brought to my Mother 's , in a Chair , she walk 'd up Stairs with Help ; but growing worse , I went for her Husband ( the Prisoner , ) and he laid his Hand on her , but she never spoke , except Oh ! to him , nor any Body else , all the Time she was at our House , tho ' one of the Witnesses swore otherwise ; I forgot her Name , but when she came into the Room I was on my Knees , reading the Visitation of the sick , and the Deceas 'd did not speake one Word to her . Between 2 and 3 on Friday , the Deceas 'd fell into Convulsions , and they held her till about the same Time next Day , and then she dy 'd . Susan Ray ( the Prisoner 's Mother . ) The Deceas 'd being very bad , my Son said to me , Dear Mother have Compassion on poor Molly , for now she 's ill I have no Convenience fit for her in my Shop . So I took her in a Chair , to my House . She could not speak , but she pointed to her Arm to be let blood , and so I went to Mr. Ward , the Surgeon , and he bled her . And the Apothecary came , and Subscribed three Blisters ; but I said , Let her have but one . Court . Why were you unwilling to have Blisters put on her Arms ? - Were you afraid the Apothecary should see her Arms ? Susan Ray . It was only for Fear of terrifying of her too much : For I have had Blisters my self , and I thought they were terrible Things ; and if God has ordain 'd us to dye , all that the Physicians can say or Subscribe signifies nothing . Court . But God has not ordain 'd that we should shorten our Lives by a wilfull Neglect - Had the Deceas 'd no Bruises ? Susan Ray . She had a Bruise on her Stomach , but that was given her by a Fellow that came in the Shop , for a Dram - Jenny Stuart saw him strike her , but they have bribed Jenny , to get out of the way . Court . Nothing of that has been proved . Eleanor Cradock . The Deceas 'd had Convulsions 3 or 4 Years , before she was married to the Prisoner , and she waisted to a 'Notomize . The Prisoner always used her well , and never mislested her , whatever she could eat or drink he would always get it for her . Isaac Thomas . The Prisoner has liv 'd in the same House with me , and I never knew him give her a Blow ; but Poverty was upon them both , and he could not do as he would . Sarah Elms . I was in his Shop every Day , and I never heard any blows , but she was very sickly . Sarah Ward , again . The 2 Men are now in Custody , who gave her the blow - The Prisoner charged them with coming into his Shop , and beating his Wife . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 20. Roger Bow , Waterman , was indicted for the Murder of Thomas Field , by giving him , with a Knife , one mortal Wound in the left side of the Belly , near the Navel , of the Length of one Inch , and Depth of 8 Inches , May 16 . of which he languished till the next Day , and then dy 'd . He was a second time indicted on the Statute of Stabbing , and a third time on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the said Murder . Thomas Crumpton . The Deceas 'd was standing at Mr. Evans 's Door , in Hungerford street , and I at Mr. Loddington the Butcher 's , which is next Door . The Prisoner came from the Water-side in his Shirt , and Slip-shod . He ask 'd the Deceas 'd for a Pin , the Deceas 'd look 'd on his Sleeve , but made no Answer . Damn it , I will do it , says the Prisoner , and reaching over the Butcher 's Shop-board , he took up a Carving-knife , and said , Damn my Blood , I 'll cut my own Throat ; and then directly stab 'd the Deceas 'd in the left side of the Belly , dropt the Knife , and ran away . The Deceas 'd stept into the Shop , fell on his right side , and cry 'd , O Lord ! I am Stab 'd . I took up his Waistcoat , and saw a little Blood ; but when I turn 'd up his Shirt , I saw part of his Cawl hang out . The Wound was about an Inch broad . I help 'd him up , and Mr. Wilky , the Surgeon , was sent for . This was about 10 at Night , and he dy 'd the next Night - The Prisoner being carried before the Justice next Morning , somebody said he stab 'd the Deceas 'd with his left Hand . No , says the Prisoner , but I stab 'd him with my right Hand , and I never saw him before - The Deceas 'd was a Stranger , he had been but 5 Weeks in Town . Prisoner . I was not in my Senses . Thomas Crumpton . He was very much in Liquor , and I believe that was all that ail 'd him - Indeed he afterwards said he had been a Bed , but that the Devil had work 'd in his Head all the Morning , so that he was oblig 'd to get up , and do some Mischief . James Roughhead . I saw the Prisoner take a Carver off the Shop-board , and push at the Deceas 'd , throw down the Knife , and endeavour to run away , but I took him , for I was but 5 or 6 Yards off . Jury . How could he run , when he was so drunk . James Roughhead He ran but 2 or 3 Doors . and then threw himself down , and I took him up , and then he ran across the Way to a Fishmonger 's shop , and beat the Fish about . Council . Did you see him do any thing in the Market ? James Roughhead . I was at Supper , and hearing a Noise , I ran out , and the People said , there was a drunken Man in the Street . Council . Was he drunk , or otherwise disorder 'd in his Senses ? James Roughhead . He was certainly disorder 'd with Drinking , for he was very much fuddled , but I did not apprehend he was under any other Disorder . James Wilky , Surgeon . On Thursday Night I was sent for to Mr. Evans , the Deceas'd 's Master , but when I came , the Deceas 'd was gone to my House . I went home , and drest him . He was wounded in the left side of the lower Belly . A Piece of his Cawl hung out : It was cut , and I cut it off . I did not probe the Wound , for it went quite through ; I drest him again , next Morning , but he dy 'd between 9 and 10 at Night . I open 'd him on Saturday , the Knife had divided the Epigastrick Artery , and the great Gut , and the Wound was the Cause of his Death . William Kemp , Constable . The Mob carried the Prisoner to St. Martin 's Watch-house , and put him in the Hole below . When I came there , I heard him a swearing at a prodigious rate ; he curst the House where he had been drinking , and sometimes lamented , and cry 'd O Lord ! O Lord ! I went down to him ( for I was above before . ) He said he had kill 'd a Man , and was sorry for it ; but Damn it , he was drunk , and the Liquor had done it , and he would dye with all the pleasure in Life . He shew 'd me a Wound in his Head , and said it was done when he was knock 'd down , and he wish 'd he had been kill 'd quite . Prisoner . I know nothing of it , for I had been light-headed several Weeks . Nicholas Carter . 8 Years ago , I was with the Prisoner on board the Cornwal , in the Baltuck , and one Day the Lieutenant put him under Confinement , for being troublesome and out of-the-way . William Costelow . 6 Years ago I was on board the Cornwal with the Prisoner at Spithead , and one Morning we went on shore at Portsmouth . We parted , and in a Quarter of an Hour I met him running with his Breeches down , and swearing , Damn his Blood , he was going to Putney . But a Man whipt him with a Horse-whip , and then he fell on his Knees . Court . Was he drunk then ? William Costelow . I do n't know ; but when we went on board , the Captain enquir 'd the meaning of it , and the Parson said , Let him be blooded . He continued on board 3 Months after , but plaid no more such Tricks - The Day of the Murder , I met him about 5 in the Evening , at the Steelyard , without his Hat . He said he had been to get an Enterprize of uncustom 'd Goods ( for he belongs to the Custom-house ) and that he had hir 'd a File of Soldiers , for a Shilling a Piece , to assist him - Then he spit in my Face , and went away , but he did not seem to be drunk . John Cunningham . I was one that went a shore with the Prisoner , at Portsmouth - he was sociable at first , but soon after , we saw him running without Coat or Cap , with his Knife in his Hand ; we took it from him , and then he pull 'd his Breeches down , and threw his Shirt over his Head , and so ran from us , but the Cockswain met him and beat him . Court . For being mad ? Or for being drunk ? John Cunningham . I suppose he thought the Prisoner had shamm 'd Madness . Daniel Clay . About 9 a Clock the Night before the Murder , the Prisoner came to my House , and said he could help me to a Prentice , and if I 'd go to Tower-hill I should see him . I told him it was too late , and we had better go to morrow ; but he would needs have me go that Night , and so at last I went . When we came to Tower-hill , he could not find the House . Then he said it was in Bishop's-gate-street . We went to Aldgate , and he said it was somewhere there-abouts . He look 'd at several Houses , but could not find the right . Thence he carried me into Fenchurch-street , where he said he was sure the House was not far off ; but still was at a Loss ; and so , to humour him , I went from one Place to another , 'till I was out of Patience , and so I brought him back to Tower-Hill , where I left him . Hannah Wade . The Prisoner , when he was upon Custom-house Duty , lodg 'd 2 or 3 Nights a Week at my House , the Cock at Iron-Gate . About 10 at Night he came home , and said , he had been with Mr. Clay . He seem 'd much disturb 'd ; he drank 2 Pints of Beer , and I bid him go to Bed and sleep . He said the Devil would not let him ; but at last I got him up Stairs . Then he cry 'd , Fire ! Murder ! and swore and tore at a strange Rate . By degrees he grew quiet , and I heard no more of him , 'till 3 in the Morning , when he came down , and my Maid let him out . He return 'd about 9 the same Thursday Morning , put up his Oars , and seem 'd very sober , 'till he call 'd a poor Man in to give him some drink , but threw it all in his Face . He ask 'd me to lend him a Guinea ; I refus 'd it . Then he said he was going to buy three Great-coats , and a Dozen of Fowls , which he would send home , and desir 'd me to pay for them . To humour him I said , Yes . He went out and came in again . I was then mincing some Meat . He catch 'd up the Knife , held me by the Head , and swore , Damn you for a Bitch , you would not lend me a Guinea , and now I 'll cut your Throat . My Daughter , and Maid crying out , he turn 'd round and threw the Meat and Pans in the Ashes ; then he push 'd the Knife against my Belly , but it being blunt , and my Coats thick , it did not hurt me . Then he went up Stairs , and made a great Uproar . I ask 'd him what he was doing ? He damn 'd me for a Bitch , and said he was breaking the House . He threw Bricks out of the Window , came down with his Cloaths unbraced , ask 'd me where his Knife was , spirted some Beer in my Face , and so ran out . E. Smith , Wade 's Maid . He call 'd all Night upon the Devil , and , in the Morning , threw some Flowers , that stood in a Pot , about the House , went out and threw . Mud in Peoples Faces . He met a Soldier , ask 'd him if he was a Man , anp then threw Dirt in his Face . The Soldier drawing his Sword , he ran away , and said , Will you kill a Madman ? He threw a Girl 's Walnuts , and a Woman 's Greens about the Street . Then he ask 'd me for some Soap , to wash himself . He rubb 'd his Hands and Face with it , and then smear 'd them all over with Soot , and so ran out , and blacked an old Man 's Face . We went up into his Room , and there he had broke all the Windows to get out , I suppose , and break his Neck , tho ' he could not because of the iron Bars ; but he had thrown his Shoes into the next Yard - The last time he went from our House , was between 5 and 6 on Thursday Evening , and the Deceas 'd was kill 'd that Night . Sam . Davis . I was his Partner in the Boat ; we went out about 4 in the Morning , and he was pretty quiet 'till about 8 , and then he swore he 'd go to a Justice , and swear Treason against his Wife , for damn her , a Bitch , she lov 'd the Pretender . He drank nothing while he was with me . William Holbrook . I lodge with Daniel Clay , a Shoemaker ; on Thursday Noon , the Prisoner came , and went up into the Garret , where the Men work ; but none of them being there ; he threw all their Tools about , and then came down , and said , he had made them a Holliday , and asked us to treat him . We gave him 3 d. Now , says he , I 'll go , and buy as much Bread , and Cheese , and Gin , as you all can eat and drink . He came back with 3 penny Loaves , threw one at a Man 's Head ; and another thro ' the Window , and the Woman calling to him to pay for the Glass , he ran away . Robert Foster . On Thursday Afternoon , he came to my Office , in the Custom-house , and said , he had seiz 'd a Cart-load of Co-chineal in Stock's-Market ; but the Basket-woman had rescu 'd it , and taken his Commission from him , and therefore he had got ten Men out of the Tower , to recover the Seizure , and wanted me to give him more Assistance - Some say , I talk like a Madman , says he , but what do you say ? Will you lend me Assistance ? I answer 'd , No . Why then God damn you , says he , I 'll serve the Crown no longer . He did not appear to be drunk , for he walk 'd very well without staggering . Juryman . Keeper , have you observ 'd him to be under any Disorder , while he was in Newgate ? Keeper . No . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 21. Elizabeth Turner , of Clerkenwell , was indicted for the Murder of her Male Bastard Infant , by strangling it with both her Hands , April 12 . Eleanor Turnly . The Prisoner was Servant to Mrs. Windsor , a Pastry-Cook , in St. John's-Lane : I and Margaret Goldsmith , came to lodge there but a little before Lady-Day , and then we observ 'd the Prisoner look 'd big , and at Easter , she look 'd very lank . We suspected she had been deliver 'd , tho ' she appear 'd publickly every Day , and we had never heard her cry out ; but then we could not think what was become of the Child . In short , we thought the Family was all alike , or things could not be kept so private . We watch 'd and harke 'd all as ever we could . One while we fancy 'd the Child might be at Nurse in the Garret , because they were often whipping up and down Stairs ; but when we could find nothing , we concluded it was baked in the Oven . At last Mrs. Goldsmith , going in o the Cellar , came up , and told me and her Husband , she had seen a Wig-box below , and smelt something . He went down , and came up again , like a dead Man , and said , he put his Hand in the Box , and felt a Child , but was so surpriz 'd , that he did not take it out . We consulted what to do , and , says I , as they have kept this Thing in hugger-mugger , we wont let 'em know the Child is found , before we send for a Constable ; so Mr. Goldsmith fetch 'd a Constable and Watch , and they brought the Child up , and it was all mouldy . The Prisoner , at first , deny 'd she had had a Child ; but in a little time own 'd it was her 's . Juryman . You seem 'd very deligent in watching the Prisoner , did you ever tax her with being with Child , before the Child was found . Turnly . No , I never spoke a Word to her about it ; for I could not bear the sight of the Creature . Margaret and Thomas Goldsmith , depos 'd to the same Effect . Elizabeth Windsor . The Prisoner never told me she was with Child ; but she said , she had been ill , and had had a great deal of Water come from her , and that then she was much better . When the Child was first found , she deny 'd it , but own 'd it afterwards . Dinah Beaven . The Child was crouded in the Box and patrify 'd . It was at the full time . I could discern no Mark of Violence .
