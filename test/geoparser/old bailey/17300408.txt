The Prosecutor added , That the Pistol which the Prisoner had when he robb 'd him , was a short , thick , knobbed Pistol , without a Guard to the Trigger , and a Pistol that answered this Descripion was produced in Court by the next Evidence . Edmund Howard produc 'd the Pistol , and depos 'd , It was the same that was dropp 'd by the Prisoner when he attack 'd Dr. Mead 's Coach , as he thinks , about the 1st of December , near Leather-Lane in Holbourn , which Pistol the Prosecutor swore to be the Pistol he presented to him when he robb 'd him . The Prisoner ask 'd Waller , whether it was Light or Dark ? He reply 'd , It was Dark , but the Link was lighted when he offered the Pistol to him , but he afterwards put it out .

It appear 'd to be after the time that the Prosecutor had found the Bill of Indictment against the Prisoner ; it was therefore thought scarce probable he should then say so . John Mitchel was also called by the Prisoner , but he having been proved to have stood in the Pillory for falsely charging a Man with Sodomy , the Court did not think fit to admit him as an Evidence .

The Prisoner 's Confession before the Justice was produced in Court , and read , wherein he confess 'd , that on Wednesday the 4th of March , he went to Mr. Ecklin 's , opened the Pantry Window , took out the Bar , put the Plate into a Bag , that he carried for that purpose , carried it to his his own Lodging , and did design to have gone beyond Sea . The Plate was produc 'd in Court , tho ' most of it broken to Pieces ; but it was plainly prov 'd to be the Prosecutor 's , by his Coat of Arms , or Crest , being Engraven on it . He call 'd two Gentlemen to his Reputation , with whom he had liv 'd as a Servant , who gave him the Character of a very honest Servant while he had liv 'd with them , and that he was a Swiss by Nation ; but the Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found him guilty .

Reward for the whole , and proportionable for any part ; that on the 9th of February , Mr. Barker told him , that one Jasper Robins had been with him , and said , that if he would give him the Reward , he believ 'd he could direct him to recover his Goods ; that some time pass 'd , and the Goods not being produc 'd , and receiving an Account that the Prisoner had them , he took him up the second time ; that thereupon William Downing came to him , and ask 'd him , why he took his Brother up again ? That he answering him , he had receiv 'd Information that his Brother had taken them , and had Reason to believe they were in his ( William Downing 's ) Custody ; he desir 'd him to deliver them up , but he deny 'd that he knew any thing of them , and pretended to go and speaks to his Brother George about them ; that afterwards George being charg 'd positively with having taken them , fell down on his Knees , and acknowledg 'd the Fact , and desir 'd a Pen , Ink , and Paper , and wrote six or seven Lines , but what it was he did not know ; and when his Brother William came , he gave it to him , who reading it , immediately tore it in Pieces , upon which , he , the Prosecutor telling him , that his tearing the Note , confirm 'd the Suspicion upon him , after taxing him more some , he at last confess 'd that he had had the Things , but could not help him to them , for he had dropped them in Hemming 's Row , which he said he did to avoid the Shame , he having never been guilty of any such thing before ; that thereupon he ( this Evidence ) sent to inquire in Hemming 's Row , and had Intelligence , that such a Tin Box had been taken up by a Servant Maid , which was brought the next Day by the said Maid , who had five Guineas for her Reward , there not being all the Things lost , in it . Jasper Robins depos 'd , That he had had several Meetings with the Prisoner , George Downing , and had several times discourse with him about a Partnership in Trade ; that the Prisoner offer 'd to advance 50 l. in order to a Partnership with him , in dealing in Cutlery Ware ; that he told him ( this Evidence ) that indeed he had it not in Money , but it was in Gold , and that was as good ; that they met sometimes in Gracechurch-Street , and sometimes in Suffolk-Street , that he going to meet him about the beginning of February , at a Publick House in Suffolk-Street , and there being some Persons there , he heard them talk of the Prisoner 's having been taken up upon Suspicion of his taking Mr. Wilson 's Goods ; that upon this , he went to Mr. Langton 's , a Goldsmith , in Lombard-Street , and desired him to let him see his File of Advertisements , which he permitted him to take ; and he carried it to George Downing , who acknowledg 'd that he had those Goods , telling him , that it was all Gold , and so was as good as Money ; but that he never saw any of the Things till after he had been taken up the second time . That then he went to Mr. Barker 's , a Goldsmith , to whom the Advertisement directed , and gave him an Account of what Intimation he had receiv 'd , that going to the Prisoner from time to time , with design to get some of them of him , in order to carry on the Partnership propos 'd , he put him off from time to time , sometimes promising to let him have a Diamond Ring , and sometimes Gold , saying , his Brother had them in keeping , who was at Up-Park , he being a Servant to the Earl of Tankerville ; the Matter rested for about a Fortnight , but seeing that he could make nothing of the Design of getting any of the Things into his Hands , he acquainted Mr. Barker , and he was taken up a second time ; that then George sent for his Brother William , who protested he was an utter Stranger to the Matter , knew nothing at all of it , said , that he was sorry his Brother should do such a scandalous Action , but that he would go and consult his Brother ; and when he came back , he said , he had had the Things , but had flung them in Hemming 's Row , and the Reason he gave for doing so , was , because his Brother having committed it , he was willing to conceal it ; that the Things were advertised , and the next Morning the Tin Box and Things were brought by a Servant Maid . Mr. Barker depos 'd , That the Prosecutor having desired him to get an Advertisement printed , according to the Custom of the Trade , he did , and thereupon received the Information from Jasper Robins , as before depos 'd , and by that Discovery , the Prisoners were apprehended , and part of the Goods recover 'd , as has before been related , and that he paid Susan Baker , who brought the Goods , the next Morning , five Guineas . Susan Baker depos 'd , That she took up the Tin Box , and Rings , and other of the Things mentioned in the Indictment , in Hemming 's Row , and carry 'd them to Mr. Barker , and he gave her the five Guineas according to the Advertisement . James Ward , the Constable , confirm 'd the Confession of both the Prisoners , as before depos 'd , at the time of their being apprehended . The Prisoners call 'd some Persons to their Reputation , which gave them an honest Character till the time of the Commission of this Fact ; but the Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found George Downing guilty of the Indictment .
