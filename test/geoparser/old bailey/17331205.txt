Johnson , Nov. 26 . Ben . Johnson . About 7 at Night , I met this Gentlewoman , in Broad St. Giles 's , she ask 'd me , to give her a Dram I refus 'd , but she follow 'd me , and begg 'd for a Pint of Beer . At last I went with her to the Three Compasses against St. Giles 's Church , where we had three Pints . We went into a private Room by ourselves , and I hid my Watch then ; but before we had empty 'd the last Pint , I miss 'd it . Upon which I call 'd the Landlord , and sent for the Constable , who carry 'd her to the W house , and from thence to the Round-House , where my Watch was found upon her . Jonathan Hazledine . I keep the Round-house . The Prisoner was brought thither to be searched for the Watch , but as we could find nothing of it in any Part of her Clothes , we concluded she had put it in a certain private Place ; I found it there , and pull 'd it out by the String . John King , Watchman . When we could not find the Watch in her Cloaths , I said , I believed she had hid it in a particular Place , which is easy to guess at without naming , for I knew such things had been done by other Gentlewomen on the like Occasion . So we propos 'd to search her , but she refusing to let us , Mr. Hazledine , the Governor of the Round house , desir 'd his Wife to do it ; but she bid him do it himself and he would , for she would not be concern 'd in any such sobb . Whereupon he undertook it , and I and the Constable of the Night , assisted in holding the Prisoner , while he examin 'd her , and in a little time he took the Watch out of the Close-Clipboard . Joseph Anderson . When we had search 'd her in the common Way , and could not find it , King told us , he believ 'd he knew where it was , and that a superficial Examination would signify nothing , for if we expected to get it , we must search to the Bottom . So I held her Hands , and turn 'd my Backside to her Feet while they made the Search , for I did not much care to see how they proceeded . I heard one of them say , that he felt it , and soon after , that he had got it out , and then I venture to look back , and saw the Watch in his hand . He wip 'd it , and gave it to me , and it is . Prisoner . I and my Husband had quarrel 'd , and I was crying as I went along the Street , when the Prosecutor met me , and ask 'd me , what I cry 'd ? I told him , I had got a wicked Husband that had abused me , My Dear , says he , will you leave him , and go along with me ? o , says I , tho ' he has been a barbarous Man te , I 'll never do that , for I bare two Children by him , and am now big with another . Will. , says he , you may go and drink with me , Forever . And so at last , he overpersuaded me and when we came to the Alehouse , he wanted to have to do with me , but having no Money he gave me the Watch to pawn for a Guinea , and then , because I refus 'd to let him have his Will , he charged me with picking his Pocket , and sent for a Constable , who carried me to the Round-house , where they stumbled and strumbled , and trowd me about till the Watch was found . Constable . She told me she knew nothing of the Watch , and never so much as saw it , but when we had found it upon her , she desired me to make the Matter as early as I could . The Jury found her guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9. William Cammell , was indicted for privately stealing a silver Watch , value 4 l. 4 s. from the Person of Walter Robotham , October 26 . Mr. Robotham . On Friday the 26th of October , between 12 and 1 at Noon , I lost my Watch in a Crowd at the Corner of Exchange Alley , where I stood to see a Man in the Pi lory , but I ca n't say who took it . William Irish As I stood to see the Man in the Pillory , I heard a Noise of a Pick-pocket , and somebody said the Prisoner had put a Water into his Pocket ; I observed him , and saw him take a Watch out of his Pocket and drop it . The Prosecutor came and owned it to be his . It had a black leather String . William Gardner . Somebody said the Prisoner had pick 'd a Watch out of a Man 's Pocket . I pick a Pocket ! says the Prisoner , what do you mean by that ? and presently he pull 'd out a Watch stily and bove it down , and I took it up . It was a silver Watch with a black String . I held it up , and Jack Catch came and said , Let 's see hold of the Watch ; and so he took it out of my Hand , and the Prosecutor came and own 'd it . John Hooper , Executioner . Faulkner was standing in the Pillory for uttering bad Money ; and while I attended there , the Prisoner came by me , and some followed him and said he had pick 'd a Man 's Pocket of a Watch ; I look 'd and saw the Watch upon the Ground ; Gardner and I stoop 'd for it at the same Time , but I took it up . Gardner . No , I , and he took it out of my Hand . Harper . I believe his Hand might be upon it , and I said , what do you do with it ? But he never held it up in any manner whatsomever . I deliver 'd it to Mr. Makepeace the Constable , at the Cross-Keys Tavern , and the Prosecutor own 'd it there . Prosecutor . Gardner took the Watch from the Ground , but did not hold it up , for Jack Catch presently snatch 'd it out of his Hand . John Jones . I saw the Prisoner have a Watch with a black String in his Hand at the Corner of 'Change-Alley , and he went into a Haberdasher 's Shop ( behind a carv 'd blue coat Boy that stands at the Door ) and put it into his Pocket . Makepeace There was an Outcry of a Pick-pocket ; Harper follow 'd him , and presently held up a Watch in his Hand , and said , Who has lost a Watch ? And as soon as he saw me , he said , Here 's a Constable ! So we went to the Cross-Keys , and there the Prosecutor saw it . Prosecutor . This is my Watch , the same that Hooper had in his Hand . The Jury found him guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 10 , 11. Anthony Lancake and James Pline , were indicted for that whereas at the Sessions held here in September last , Abraham Gibson * was indicted for stealing two Wigs , value 8 l. 8 s. and four Hats , value 2 l. 7 s. in the House of Jacob Kendall , June 17. and found guilty to the value of 39 s. he the said Limcake did receive the said four Hats , and the said Pline did receive the said two Wigs , knowing them to have been stolen , June 8 . * See the Trial of Abraham Gibson , in the Sessions Paper , Numb . VII . p. 184. Susan Jones . On the 18th of June last , between 8 and 9 in the Morning . I went to the Prisoner Lankey [ Lancake 's ] Shop in Chick-lane . He clapp 'd his Hand upon my Head , and said , Molly , what do you want ? For he used to call me Molly , tho ' my Name is Sue . I shewed him a Hat , for I had but one with me then , and that was the best of the four . He ask 'd me , How much ? I said 7 s. He laugh 'd , and ask 'd me what I meant by it ? Then he felt of it , and measur 'd the Crown , and said it was a large Crown , and bid me 3 s. 6 d. At last he gave me 4 s. and ask 'd me if I had any more ? I told him yes , I had three more at the George Alehouse in Chick lane ; he bid me fetch 'em directly because he was going out ; I went and put them one in another , and brought them on my Head ; he blam 'd me for bringing them in such a gaping open manner ; he examin 'd them as he did the other , and said , they were broad Brims and old-fashion 'd , tho ' the first was as good as new , and two of these were little the worse for wearing , but the other one was an old one . I told him the Price of the three was 14 s. he laugh 'd , as before , and ask 'd me what I meant by it ? and then bid me 7 s. 6 d. and at last came to 8 s. and said he would give no more I went back to Will Newell ( from whom I had them ) and ask 'd him if I should take the Money ? He said I must if I could get no more , and so I went again to Lankey , who paid me 8 s for them , and then put them behind his Counter . Lancake . I know no more of it than the Man in the Moon ; I never saw this Girl before , and she 's hir 'd by the Constable to swear this against me . George Dean . I have frequently seen Sue Jones at Lancake 's Shop a selling Hats to him . I knew she kept ill Company , and have warn 'd several of my Neighbours not to buy any Thing of her . Jacob Kendall . Three of the four Hats which were lost out of my House were mine ; one of them cost me 25 s. and the other two 16 s. a-piece ; I bought them at Easter , and lost them the 17th of June following . Abraham Gibson was convicted here in last September , for stealing them and two Wigs , on the Evidence of Sue Jones and Will . Newell . Court . Is Newell here ? Prosecutor . No , I believe he is in New-Prison . Court . You ought to have had him here , for without his Evidence I do n't see how you will prove that the Hats bought by the Prisoner Lancake are the same that Abraham Gibson was convicted of stealing . William Matthews . When I took the Prisoner , Lancake , he said he did not know but he might buy the Hats , for his Shop was his Market . He pull 'd off the Hat he wore , which I thought was a very good one , and he said he bought it for 2 s. - It was 7 Hours before he could get Bail . Some of Lancake 's Neighbours , who were Dealers in the same Way , appear 'd to his Character , and swore he was a very honest Man , and so cautious in buying Goods , that they had frequently seen him strict examine People that brought any Thing to his Shop to sell . There was no Evidence given against the other Prisoner , Pline , and the Jury acquitted them both . 12. John Cox , was indicted for privately stealing 48 iron Hoops , value 3 l. the Goods of Thomas Tomes , in his Warehouse , October 19 . Thomas Tomes . I have a Warehouse near Cavendish-Square , in which I had several large Iron-bound Casks , new painted , for a Distiller . I went out of Town the 1st of October , and return 'd the 28th , when I found my Casks stripp 'd of most of the Hoops . Thomas Smithers . On Saturday Morning , Oct. 13. the Watchman knock 'd my Mistress Tomes up , and told her the Warehouse was broke open ; I went and found the Door broke , the Lock off , the Staple drawn , and the Casks lying at Rack and Manger , with the Hoops knock 'd off . Three or four Days after I saw five or six of these Hoops at the Door of Benj Gilbert , a Smith ; I told my Mistress , got a Warrant from Justice Lamb , and upon Search found a Dozen at Gilbert 's , and two more at John Harvey 's ; I know the Hoops to be the same we lost , because they are painted Green , have no Rivets , and when we try 'd 'em they jump 'd exactly into the Places they were taken from , and we could try them well enough , because some of the Casks had two or three Hoops left on them , which held them together . Gilbert and Harvey depos 'd that they bought the Hoops for a Penny a Pound of the Prisoner , who told them they were old Hoops that came off some Casks where he had been doing a Jobb , and were given him to sell . The Prisoner pretended he had those Hoops of a Carpenter to sell for him , but said he did not know who the Carpenter was , where to find him . The Jury found him guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 13 . 14. Mary Royley and Mary Judge , alias Death , were indicted for privately stealing 34 Yards of Check , value 30 s. in the Shop of Eleanor Griffin , November 17. Mary Atkinson . I was looking after my Daughter Eleanor Griffin 's Shop in Red-lion-square , and the two Prisoners were standing at the Door ; I had Occasion to go backwards , and returning presently , I saw Royley in the Shop with something under her Ridinghood . Good Woman , says I , you have got something there . No I ha n't , says she , and stepp 'd out ; I follow 'd her , and call 'd out to a Man who stopp 'd her . John Lowing . As I went by the Prosecutor 's Door I saw Judge on the Steps , and Royley in the Shop , by the Counter-side , and nobody else being in the Shop , I suspected them , and passing by the Door , stood to watch . Presently Royley came out , and Mrs. Atkinson follow 'd , and cry 'd , Spher ; which I did , and saw this Piece of Check under her Riding-hoop , but she dropp 'd it in the Dirt before I could take it from her . Judge , by this Time , was got to Theobald's-Row , which is about 100 Yards from the Shop , but I ran after her , and brought her back . The Jury found Royley guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. and acquitted Judge . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 15 , 16 Henry Baxter and John Rook , alias Jack-the-Hatter + , was indicted for assaulting Samuel Maxwell in an open Field near the Highway , in the Parish of Stepney , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 19 s. 6d . November 22 . + This is not that Jack-the-Hatter who was convicted of several Felonies in September last . The Prisoners pray 'd the Witnesses might be examin 'd a-part , which the Court granted . Samuel Maxwell . On Thursday , November 22 , about five in the Evening I went with my Master , Mr. Wilmot , to the Globe at Mile-End ; I expected to meet a Man with whom I had some Business to do , but he not coming , I told my Master , I thought there would be no Occasion for me to stay . My Master telling me I might do as I would , I concluded to go , but having received some Money at Stepney , I thought it would not be safe for me to venture over the Fields with it alone , and so I left 26 l. with him , and came away about six a Clock ; but recollecting that I still had 7 l. 10 s. in Moidores and Silver , I put it into my Side-pocket for the better Security . Coming into White-horse-lane I was met by three Men , one of them , which I think was Baxter , pass 'd me , and bid me good Night , but presently turn 'd back again , when one of the others , in a red Coat , with a thick short Stick in his left Hand and a Pistol in his right , bid me deliver , and swore he had seen me put Money in my left Side-pocket ; I gave him the Silver , but not the Moidores ; then he demanded my Watch , I told him it was a Family-Watch , and I hop 'd he would not take it from me . Why then , says he , you may keep it ; go forward , and say you are well us 'd . So we parted , and I return 'd another Way to my Master at the Globe , and told him and Mr. Collingwood , who was with him , what had happen 'd . I staid with them there about three or four Hours , and then we all three came away together . We took Links with us , and coming to the same Place where I had been robb 'd , we saw two Men running towards us ; For God 's sake , says one of them , have a Care , Gentlemen , we are frighted out of our Wits ; we met a wild Bull , and thought the Devil was coming for us . As they look 'd like loose Fellows , Mr. Collingwood ask 'd them if there had not been a Robbery there that Night ? They said , they had not heard of any . I thought I knew them again , and taking hold of one of them , whose Name is Macdonald , I told him he was the Man that robb 'd me . The other was Baxter , and him my Master and Mr. Collingwood took Care of . We carry 'd them to the Sun Tavern at Stepney , where we search 'd them , and found a large Fowl upon one , and two Chickens upon t'other . We provided them with separate Lodgings for that Night , - the Watch-house and the Round-house . I saw Macdonald next Morning , and then he confess 'd that he was the Man who took my Money , and said , as he us 'd me well in giving me my Watch again , he hop 'd I would let him be an Evidence . Thomas Wilmot . My Clerk left me and Mr. Collingwood at the Globe between five and six , in order to go home , but in a little Time he return 'd again , and told us he had been robb 'd ; he stay 'd with us till about ten , and then we went away together . In the Field we met Baxter and Macdonald running as if they were frighted out of their Wits . They said they had met a mad Bull ; we charg 'd them with the Robbery , and carry 'd them to the Sun at Stepney - Baxter confess 'd . George Collingwood . Going over the Fields with Mr. Wilmot and his Clerk , two Fellows came running along , and crying out , Lord have Mercy upon us ! - O Lord ! - a mad Bull ! - the Devil ! - has frighted us out of our Wits . I thought they look 'd like a Couple of Rogues , and the Prosecutor said , he believ 'd they were the Men that robb 'd him , and so we made bold to secure them both . John Macdonald . I and the two Prisoners went out together upon the Account . We call 'd at the Globe , at Mile-End , where we saw the Prosecutor taking some Money out of his Pockets , and so we went out , and watch 'd him , and as he came over the Bank , I stopp 'd him , and demanded of him his Money . He made no Ressistance , but gave me 19 s. and 6 d. out of his Pocket . Then I bid him deliver his Watch ; he said , it was a Family-Watch , and hop 'd we would not take it from him . Well , says I , take it again then , and say you was well used . So we left him , and went round by Bow , and in 3 Hours after , came to the same Field again , where we were frighted by a mad Bull . Rook , ran away with the Money , and Baxter and I ran athurt [ athwart ] the Path where we were taken . Baxter . Had you none of the Money ? Macdonald . No ; Rook run away with it all . * * It appears that Macdonald took the Money from the Prosecutor , but he might afterwards give it to Rook . Baxter . What Cloaths do you say we had on ? Macdonald . I had a red Coat , a short Stick , and a Pistol , Baxter had a great Coat , and Rook had a new Coat with Buttons on it . Baxter . Where did we meet ? Macdonald . Baxter and I went from Mary Aldus 's House and going along by the Gardens near the Hog-house , we met Rook . Baxter . We were all at Low-Layton , from 3 in the Afternoon , 'till 10 at Night . Macdonald . We were at a Place , 4 Miles from Stra'ford , I do n't know the Name of it , it might be Low-Layton ; but we went from Aldus 's between 10 and 11 in the Morning , and return 'd between 2 and 3 . Baxter . You know what a vile Fellow you have been . You was an Evidence against Stockings , and Will . White . + + See the Trial of Tho . Wadsworth , Will . White , and John Powell , alias Fisherman , in the Session-Paper , for April last , Numb . IV . p. 124. Mary Aldus . I live in Church-Lane . About a Fortnight ago , Baxter and Macdonald lay at my House , I think it was a Wednesday Night , and next Morning they went out together , between 10 and 11 a Clock ; my Husband was then sick a-Bed . But they came not near us 'till next Day , for then they were carry 'd before the Justice , and my Husband was taken out of his Bed at the same time , and carry 'd before the Justice too . John Tindall . I took Rook last Sunday Night , in Blue-Coat-Fields , by the Direction of Macdonald , who told me , he went by the Names of John Rook , and Jack-the-Hatter , I found him , sitting by the Fire with two Women . Is not your Name Rook ? says I . No ; says he . Nor Jack-the-Hatter ? says I . No ; says he again , Pray who are you ? I told him I was a Constable , and came to carry him to the Watch-house .

Oct. 20 . Alice Greenfield . Going home from Leaden-Hall , about 12 at Night , the Prisoner met me in Goodman's-Fields , forced me into an Alley , and threw me down ; I cry 'd out , Murder ! Thieves ! and Help , for the Lord 's sake ! Mr. Matthews came to my Assistance , and took him . I said , Thank you kindly , Sir , you have saved my Life , and my Money too . I did not know then , that my Money was lost , for I had wrapt it in a Paper , and put it in my Bosom to another Paper that had Tea-dust in it , and while the Prisoner struggl 'd with me , I took one of the Paper ; out of my Bosom , and thought , in the Fright I was in , that it had been my Money ; but when I was a little recover 'd , I found my Mistake , for it was the Paper of Tea-dust . Mr. Matthews . I keep a Coffee-house , in Goodman's-Fields . About twelve at Night , as I was shutting my Door , I heard a sad cry of Murder , and Thieves . I run down an Alley near at Hand , but found no Body there , and all was silent for two or three Minutes ; but turning the Corner of that Alley , I heard the Shrieking again . The Sound led me to another Alley , where I found the Woman lying upon the Ground , with her Arms extended , and the Prisoner endeavouring to get her Hands open . They were not in any unseemly Posture , I secur 'd the Man , and call 'd the Watch . The Woman said , God bless you , Sir , you have sav 'd my Life , and my Money too .

Man but the Prisoner Prisoner . I heard her cry out in a bar barous Manner , and meeting a Man in the Alley , I ask 'd , what was the Matter ? He said , No harm ; and so he went away , and I went to her , and she gave me her Hand to help her up , for she was very drunk , and then Mr. Matthews came and took him . Matthews . The Woman a in a great Surprize , but I did not perceive she was drunk . The Jury found him guilty to the We of 10 d. The Court ( before the Verdict was Recorded ) inform 'd them , that in a Robbery , the Value was not material , and therefore they had nothing to consider , but whether the Prisoner robb 'd the Woman or not . The Jury said , they believed he robb 'd her of some Money ; but were doubtful of how much . The Court again , told them , they were not to regard the Sum , but if upon the Evidence given , it appear 'd to them , that he robb 'd her , they ought to find him Guilty , or otherwise to Acquit him . Then the Jury acquitted him . 19. Elizabeth Baker , was indicted for stealing a Seat of a Chair , and two Curtains , the Goods of Joseph Plat and Giles Hancock , November 30 . Guilty .

John Cullington , otherwise Mendall , was indicted for assaulting William Murray , on the Highway , in the Parish of Stepney , putting him in Fear , and taking from him two Pistols , value 5 l. the Goods of John Chapman , Esq ; Sept. 17 . He was a second Time indicted for assaulting Sir William Chapman , Knight and Baronet , on the Highway , in the Parish of Stepney , putting him in Fear , and taking from him four half Guineas , Sept. 17. William Murray . On the 17th of September , about eight at Night , between Bow and Mile-End , I was robb 'd by a Man on Horse-back , of a Brace of Pistols , capp 'd with Silver , the Property of John Chapman , Esq ; my Master , Sir William Chapman , was then in his Coach , about a hundred Yards from me . As soon as the Man had robb 'd me , he rode towards the Coach , and fir 'd a Pistol . I ca n't swear that the Prisoner is the Man , for it was dark , and he who took the Pistols from me , had a Great-coat on , with the Cape button 'd up - But these are the Pistols , I know them by the Mounting and one of the Rammers being broke . They were found upon the Prisoner , by one of Sir Cordel Firebrass 's Servants . John Felt . These Pistols , and these other three , I took from the Prisoner in the Road , between Sudbury and Melford . It happen 'd that he fell from his Horse , and dislocated his Neck ; and as I was near him , at the same time , I dismounted , and put his Neck in its place again . Some Bullets fell out of his Pocket , which made me suspect him for a Highwayman , and therefore I secur 'd him ; and my Master gave Sir William Chapman notice of it . Sir William Chapman . I heard some Disturbance in the Road , and a Gentleman , who was with me in the Coach , said , he believ 'd the Quarrel was with my Servant . I look 'd out , a Pistol was fir 'd , and a Man rode up to the Coach-door , and said , Gentlemen , deliver your Money immediately . My Son and the other Gentleman , gave him something , and I gave him four half Guineas . I observ 'd his Horse curvetted , as if the Noise of the Pistol had frighted him . Prisoner . As I was going to Bury , I found those five Pistols on the Road , and thought I might as well take them up , as leave them there for any Body else . The Jury found him guilty of both Indictments . Death . 24. Mary Doe , was indicted for the Murder of her Male Bastard Infant , by strangling and choaking it with both her Hands , on the 29th of October last . Frances Crook , Midwife . On the 30th of October , I was sent for to the Prisoner , and found she had been delivered of a Child . She said , something ( she knew not what ) was come from her , but it was no Child . I ask 'd her , what she did with that which came from her ? She said she did not know where it was . I told her it signify 'd nothing to deny it , for I was sure she had had a Child , and therefore a Child I would find . Then she confess 'd that it was a Man Child ; but said it was born dead , and that her Father took it from her , but she could not tell what he had done with it . Her Father coming in I told him his Daughter had been Deliver 'd - Deliver 'd ! says he , Ay , so she has - of a Sir-Reverence . Those were his Words , begging your Worship 's Pardon . I saw so much by his Behaviour towards the Prisoner , and some other Passages , that in short , I told him , I believ 'd he was Father to the Child , as well as Grandfather ; and that he had done my Business , and deliver 'd her himself before I was sent for . So he went out , and I examin 'd the Prisoner , and she declar 'd to me , that her Father had lain with her , and that she never had to do with any other Man but him . On the 2d of November following , the Prisoner 's Mother gave me a Note , I suppose it was sent from her Husband , who was then run away , and in this Note , it was said , that the Child was wrapt up in an old Curtain , and laid in among some Horse-litter in Tom Turd's-Hole ( a Place where the Nightmen lay their Soil ) and there it was found . I saw no Marks of Violence upon it ; but I believe it bled to death for want of proper Help . Joseph Sandford , Surgeon , in Goodman's-Fields . On the 2d of November last a Male Infant ( suppos 'd to be born of the Prisoner , Mary Doe ) was brought to me to have my Opinion , whether it had been Still-born , or not . I view 'd the Body , and found no external Marks of Violence ; upon which I proceeded to open the Cavities of the Thorax and Abdomen . The Lungs appear 'd inflated ; I cut off one of the Lobes , and putting it into a Vessel of Water , it floated ; I am therefore of Opinion that the Infant had breathed ; I likewise found that the Blood-vessels in general were empty , and the Navel-string lacerated , and not ty 'd ; for which Reason , I believe , proper Help was wanting , and the Child might bleed to Death . Mary White . The Prisoner and her Father and Mother liv 'd in a Room in my House for many Years ; her Father is a Journeyman Carpenter , and her Mother went out a Washing . The Prisoner , as far as ever I saw , always behaved herself prettily and modestly , tho ' at last , poor Creature , she happen 'd to be with Child , and she was deliver 'd in my House . Court . Did she call for Help ? M White . I can not say that I heard her . Court . Do you think she was so weak that she could not , or that she was under any Surprize , and her Labour came so suddenly that she had not Time to call for Assistance ? M. White . I know nothing as to those Things , but here is a Waistcoat proper for a young Child , which found in a Waistcot Box in her Room , and she said she had provided it for that Purpose ; and she told me her Father took the Child from her - poor young Creature - she 's hardly Sixteen - her wicked Father has ruin 'd her . John Tindall , Constable . The Midwife brought me a Note with Directions to search for the Child among some Sraw , by the Hog-house in Tom T - d's-fields , and there we found it wrapp 'd up in a Linsey-Woolsey Curtain - Her Father is in Reading Goal . Susan Glover . I have known the Prisoner two or three Years ; I always took her for a good-natur 'd , inoffensive , modest Girl , and I was extreamly startled at the News of her having had a Child ; I talk 'd with her about it - she complain 'd of her Father for deluding her , and said she had indeed had a Child , but that her Father took it from her , and she did not see it more . There were no Marks of Violence on the Child , and I believe it might bleed to death thro ' her Ignorance and want of proper Help . Eleanor Whitchurch . I always took her for an honest sober Girl before this Misfortune , and I believe the Child might die for want of Help . The Jury acquitted her . 25 , 26. John Anderson and James Baker , alias Stick-in-the-Mud , were indicted for breaking and entring the House of Robert Rayner , and stealing three pair of Shoes , value 15 s. three Shoes , value 7 s. and one Boot , value 7 s. October 16. about the Hour of 8 in the Night . Robert Rayner . I keep a Shoemaker 's Shop in the Haymarket ; about 8 at Night the Sash of my Shop was lifted up , and the Shoes and Boot taken away - I afterwards receiv 'd a Letter from Abraham Wild , informing me , that he and the Prisoners committed the Fact . Baker . Were the Shoes you lost squaretoed or round-toed ? Rayner . The two odd Shoes and the Boot were square-toed , and the rest were round . Abraham Wild . The Prisoners and I set out from a Brandy- shop , the Corner of St. Martin's-lane in the Strand , between seven and eight at Night ; we went up Pall-M , thro ' St. James's-Square , and so to the Hay-market , and coming to the Prosecutor 's Shop , Baker shov 'd the Sash a little way up ; we walk 'd by , and coming back again , Anderson shov 'd it a little higher ; we pass 'd by a second time , and making a quick Return , I shov 'd it a little more , and so we took it by Turns till we had got it quite up , and then the Prisoners took out three pair of roundtoed Shoes , a square-toed Boot , and three odd Shoes , two of which were square Toes and one round , and brought 'em to me , for I stood two or three Doors off to watch ; we shar 'd them in the Street , one pair a piece , and I kept the odd ones and the Boot . Then we went to a Shop in Tyburn-Road , where we drank half a Pint of Cherry Brandy and parted . Not long after this I grew wary of keeping ill Company , and wanted to get clear of them , and so I went voluntarily before my Lord Mayor and made my information , upon which I was admitted an Evidence . Baker . This was not the first time of your being an Evidence ; and besides , you have been transported . Wild . I never was an Evidence before , but I own I was transported * about twelve Years ago , and I serv 'd my Time out , and went to Sea afterwards , and liv 'd honestly till lately I fell again into ill Company . * Abraham Wild , in April 1721 , was indicted with John Gascoyn , for robbing Ann Shaw on the Highway , of a Pocket , a Handkerchief , and half a Crown . John Unwin , an Accomplice , was an Evidence against them , but they were both acquitted . The Fact Wild was transported for was committed some Time after this . Anderson . Where did you first come acquainted with me ? Wild . At the Corner of Cornhill , about two or three Months ago ; you were talking in the Street with Will . Isaacson , whom I had known a pretty while , for he was transported in a Maryland Ship that I belong 'd to , after I had serv 'd my Time beyond Sea ; the next Time I met you was in Smithfield , where we drank together , and I met you again with Frank Ogliby the Beginning of October , about Midnight , when we went and broke open this Gentleman [ Thomas Ryner 's ] House , and that was the first Fact I did in your Company . Mr. Harding . I have known Anderson fourteen or fifteen Years ; he work 'd with me , off and on , about two Years - the last Time was about a Year ago , and he behav 'd himself then very well . Mr. Wakins . I have known him ten or twelve Years ; he work 'd half a Year for me , about a Year and a half ago ; he was a sober honest Lad , and behav 'd well . Daniel Street . I have known him from a Child ; I work 'd with him at Mr. Harding 's above a Year ago , and he bore a good Character . The Jury found them both Guilty . Death . 27. John Anderson and James Baker , alias Stick-in-the-Mud , were a second time indicted , with Francis Ogleby , for breaking and entering the House of Thomas Rayner , and stealing a silver Mug , value 3 l. two silver Salvers , value 3 l. a pair of silver Snuffers and Stand , value 3 l. a silver Pepper-box , value 20 s. and a Hat , value 10 s. the Goods of Thomas Rayner , October 4 . between the Hours of two and three in the Night . The Prisoners pray 'd the Witnesses might be examin 'd a-part , which the Court granted . Thomas Rayner . My House in Church-street , in St. Ann 's , Soho , was broke open the 4th or 5th of October last ; I do n't know at what Hour it was done , for the first News I heard of it was about eight in the Morning , when I came down Stairs ; the Goods were lost out of my Fore-parlour ; there were double Shutters to the Windows , but they were both broke thro ' ; the Iron-bar was bent thus - and I saw in the outer Shutter the Mark of a Chissel , with which , I suppose , they were wrenched open . Court . What Goods did you miss ? Mr. Rayner . A silver pint Mug , a pair of silver Salvers , a pair of silver Snuffers and Stand , a silver Pepper-box and a Hat . Eliz . Chejoy . I left the Shutters fast between six and seven at Night , and found 'em broke open between seven and eight in the Morning ; the Sashes of that Window that was open stood double . Court . How do you mean ? E. Chejoy . The under Sash was thrown half way up , and the upper one drawn as far down ; the Plate was taken out of the Boufet . Abraham Wild . The Watch was calling past twelve when Baker and I met Anderson and Ogleby by Charing-cross ; they ask 'd us whither we were going ? we said we could not very well tell , and so , after a little Talk , we went all together to the Night-cellar by Privy-garden . Court . Privy-garden ! Wild . I do n't know whether they call it Privy-garden or Spring-garden , but its over-against the Meuse . Court . What Discourse had you there ? Wild . Nothing but Here 's to you ; we drank but one Pot there , and then we came up and went into the Hay-market , and coming to the Corner of St. James's-street , as you go towards the Tennis-court , says Ogleby , Here 's two Stalls where the People leave their Goods all Night , let 's mill 'em , that is , break 'em open ; we soon agreed upon it , and Anderson wrench 'd one of the Doors open with a Chissel , but we found nothing there that was worth stealing , and so we look 'd out for a better Chance . We came at last into Church-street , where , pushing against a Shutter , he said it was loose , and bid us stay a little ; we stopp 'd , and he put a Chissel betwixt the two Shutters , and , with a hard Wrench , forc 'd it open ; it made such a Noise that we were afraid it would alarm the Family , or the Watch , who stood at the Corner of the Street , and therefore we retreated for two or three Minutes , and stood at a little Distance to see the Event ; but finding all safe , we went again , and blew out the Lamp that was at the Door . Then Anderson stood upon my Shoulders , pull 'd down the upper Sash , and reaching over , undid the inner Shutters . Getting down again , he endeavour 'd to push up the under Sash , but not being able to do it , Ogleby try 'd at it , rais 'd it a little with his Hands , and clapping his Shoulders under , forc 'd it up high enough for us to enter . Anderson stepp 'd over the Way , and getting up to a Lamp , lighted a Candle , put it into his Dark-lanthorn , and went into the House by himself , while we stood without to watch ; he brought out a silver Mug , one silver Salver , a silver Stand for Snuffers , a silver Pepper-box , and a Man 's Hat ; if he took any Thing else he sunk it , for that was all we saw . By this Time it was between two and three in the Morning ; we went thence to Stocks-market , and then it was near four . None of us having any Money left , I gave my Hat to Ogleby , and putting the Prosecutor 's Hat upon my Head , went into the Brandy-shop on the left Hand facing the Market , and desir 'd the Man to let us have half a Pint of Gin and 6 d. upon it till the Morning , tho ' indeed it was Morning then . He refus 'd to lend us 6 d. but said we might have the Gin , we agreed to it ; the Gin was drawn , but while we were drinking , I thought he seem 'd to be suspicious of us , for he look 'd upon the Hat , and said it was a very good one , and then going to the Door call 'd Lightfoot ; we concluded Light-foot was a Watchman , so bidding the Man take Care of the Hat , we made haste away . Anderson pawn 'd a Handkerchief for 6 d. and with that Money we went the same Morning and redeem 'd the Hat . Thence we walk 'd to Elizabeth Whitehead 's , in some Court or Alley in Turnmill-Street , to sell the Plate ; we knock 'd her up , and Baker went out with her to see the Plate weigh 'd ; we waited about an Hour at her House , and they not returning , we stepp 'd over the Way to an Alehouse ; Baker came thither to us in a little Time , and told us the Plate weigh 'd twenty one Ounces , but it was two or three Hours before Whitehead follow 'd ; she brought four Guineas , which was what the Plate came to at 4 s. an Ounce ; she gave the Money to Anderson , we shar 'd it equally , and had a Guinea a-piece . Ogleby . Where did you see me first ? Wild . That was the first time when I met you at Charing-cross , but I have often drank with you since , at the Corner of St. Martin's-lane . Ogleby . I 'll prove that I never drank with you in my Life . Wild . Do if you can . Anderson . And where was it you saw me first ? Wild . I told you before , at the Corner of Cornhill , and that I saw you afterwards in Smithfield , and that this Fact was the first we committed together . Ogleby . Did you ever see me from the Time you came to England to the Time we committed this Transgression ? Wild . No , I told you just now , that this was the first time I saw you . Ogleby . And how do you know what Day it was ? Wild . The last Execution at Tyburn was on a Saturday , and this was the Day before . Ogleby . Did you ever know any Robberies that I committed ? Wild . Yes . Ogleby . Name as many as you please . Wild . Since I came in you wanted to make your self an Evidence . Ogleby . I might hang you by Report , for you made your Brags to me that you have snatch 'd twenty Pockets in a Night , besides a gold Watch once ; and you said , that when you and John Gascee wanted Money you went a snatching Pockets together . Wild . And just now you said you had never been in my Company . Baker . How came you acquainted with me ? Wild . I first fell in your Company at Buck 's Brandy-shop by St. Giles 's Church , on a Thursday , between two and three in the Afternoon , which was the Day before this Gentleman 's House was broke ; there we drank together , and I desir 'd you to sell a Handkerchief for me , for 6 d. which you did , and I spent all the Money there . When it was Dark we went out together , and pick 'd Pockets till past twelve , and then meeting with Anderson and Ogleby , by Charing cross , as I said before , we went and broke open the House . The Jury found them guilty . Death . 28. John Anderson was a third time indicted with Samuel Flax , for breaking and entring the House of Richard Carlton , and stealing half a Firkin of Butter , value 12 s. and a Cheese , value 4 s. November 7 . about eleven at Night . Richard Carlton . The Goods were brought out of my Shop between ten and eleven at Night ; the Door was shut . Anderson . Was it a whole Door , or a half Door ? Carlton . A half Door . Anderson . And could nobody get over it without breaking it open ? Carlton . Not easily , for it was pretty high from the Street . Abraham Wild . Between ten and eleven at Night the Prisoners and I went to the Shop ; I reach 'd over the half Door , and unbolted it ; but there being a Bell at the Bottom , we waited till a Coach came by , and then Anderson took hold of the Door , and some how giving a Thrust with his Knee , forc 'd the Lock open , and so went in and took the Goods . Court . As the upper Door was open , this was not a Burglary . The Jury found them guilty of Felony . [ Flax : Transportation . See summary . ] 29. William Bray , was indicted for stealing two Tons of old Cast-iron , value 10 l. the Property of John Williams , Aug. 27 . Council . The Prosecutor lives in Monmouth-street , and deals in old Clothes ; he sent some Goods to Dunkirk , and had Returns in old Cast-iron , which was brought in Captain Hammond 's Ship to Iron-gate , and there put into the Prisoner 's Boat , in order to be carry 'd to a Person at St. Saviour's-dock , who had bought it ; but , if my Instructions are right , the Prisoner sent the Prosecutor on a sleeveless Errand , and then , with the Assistance of one Darling , put part of this Iron into another Boat , and carry 'd it to the Faulcon and sold it . John Williams . I have had a World of Wrong done me , my Lord , a World of Wrong , indeed ! I bought four Tons of old Iron , my Lord , and eight hundred Weight , my Lord , and a Quantity of old Rags , my Lord , and it was brought to London , my Lord , in Captain Hammond 's Ship , my Lord , and , my Lord , it was brought to Iron-gate in the said Ship , my Lord ; and so , my Lord , I went to the Custom-house to pay the Juty , my Lord , for , my Lord , I did not know there was any Juty to be paid upon old Iron , my Lord ; and , my Lord , the Iron was put into Bray 's Boat , my Lord ; yes , my Lord , it was put into Bray , s Boat , my Lord , to be carry 'd to Mr. Spencer 's , my Lord , at Savorie's-dock , my Lord , from Iron-gate , my Lord ; for I had agreed with Mr. Spencer for 4 l. 15 s. a Ton , my Lord ; and I sold it him three Days before I sent it , my Lord , and Mr. Spencer paid me very honestly for it , my Lord ; and it was Mr. Spencer , my Lord , that sent the Prisoner to fetch the Iron . Court . If you had sold it to Spencer , it was his Property . But the Prisoner is charged with stealing Goods that were your Property . Williams . Yes , my Lord , he is so , my Lord , and it was my Property , and my Goods , my Lord , and none of Mr. Spencer 's , my Lord ; it 's true indeed , my Lord , and I 'll tell my honourable Lordship how it was , my Lord , for when Bray , my Lord , had carry 'd the Iron to Mr. Spencer , my Lord , Mr. Spencer would take but 18 hundred Weight , because he said , my Lord , that it was not fit for his Purpose , my Lord , and so I came and call 'd a Sculler , my Lord , yes , my Lord , I call 'd a Sculler , and Mr. Spencer told me , that when I had paid the King 's Juty , my Lord , he would send a Lighter , and fetch the Iron , my Lord . Court . But you said Spencer would have no more of it . Williams . O Lord ! my Lord , this was before he had the 18 hundred Weight , my Lord , and so when I came to the Water-side , it was 11 a Clock , my Lord , yes , my Lord , it was 11 a Clock , and meeting with Bray , unknown , my Lord , I say , my Lord , Bray , unknown , for I did not know him , my Lord , and I wanting a Waterman to Savorie's-Dock , my Lord , he ask 'd me , if I wanted a Waterman to Savorie's-Dock , my Lord , and says Bray to me , my Lord , for Bray was in a small Boat , my Lord , says Bray , Mister Williams , says he , I know you , Mister Williams , says he , and I have fetch 'd old Rags for you , says he ; and says she , why ca n't you let me carry the Iron , says he ; and so says I , to Mr. Spencer , Mr. Spencer , says I , the Captain makes a sad Noise at me , for letting the Iron lie so long in the Ship , and therefore , pray Mr. Spencer , says I , why do n't you take it away ? Council . Was Spencer with you at the Water-side ? Williams . No , my Lord , Spencer was not with me , and please my honourable Lordship . But this was after I was at the Water-side , my Lord , and I went over to Spencer , my Lord , and Bray , my Lord , was with me ; yes , my Lord , this was afterwards , and Bray was with me , my Lord , and says Bray , my Lord , Pray Mister Spencer , says he , ca n't I carry it ? says he . And says Mr Spencer , Have you got a Lighter ? says he . And Bray said , Yes . And then Mr. Spencer bid him be ready by the Ship 's side by two a Clock in the Afternoon , my Lord , and I went back with Bray , my Lord , to Capt . Hammond 's Ship , my Lord , and Bray went with me , my Lord , and so he went to fetch his Lighter , my Lord , and I stay 'd in the Ship , in Capt . Hammond 's Ship , my Lord , till four a Clock , my Lord , and then Bray came with the Lighter , my Lord , and I went to Mr. Spencer between three and four a Clock . Court . You said you staid in the Ship till four ? Williams . God save your Lordship , my Lord ! no my honourable Lordship , it was four a Clock when I came back , my Lord , for I went to Mr. Spencer , my Lord , and told him , my Lord , that I wonder 'd Bray was not come for the Iron , my Lord , and Mr. Spencer bless 'd himself , my Lord , to think , my Lord , that he could not have it sent that Night , my Lord , and so he sent another Lighter man with me , my Lord , but when we came to the Ship , my Lord , there was Bray , my Lord , with his Lighter , my Lord , by the Ship 's side , my Lord , and so , my Lord , the Iron was put into Bray 's Lighter , and he carry 'd it to Mr. Spencer , my Lord , at Savorie's-Dock , my Lord , and I went with him , my Lord , and Mr. Spencer took 18 hundred Weight , my Lord . Council . As I apprehend it , here was a Contract for the Iron , and a Delivery of it to Spencer 's Man . Spencer refus 'd part , and the rest that was sent back , was that which Bray went away with : Is that your meaning ? Williams . No , my Lord , I beg your Lordship 's Pardon , I sold but 18 hundred to Spencer ; but Bray took my Iron the Day before I went to Spencer . Court . The Day before ? Williams . Ess , my Lord , for I found 5 hundred Weight at Mr. Wood 's , at the Faulcon ; ess , my Lord , it was the 5th of September at Night , and I found several . Tubs taken from the Iron , as Bray and I came from Spencer 's , and says I to Bray , Where 's the Tubs , Mr. Bray ? says I , my Lord , and Bray , my Lord , was to carry the Iron to a Gentleman in Thames-Street , and upon the 7th of September , I was to carry some to Mr. Harrison , my Lord , and Bray run away from me , my Lord , for he was gone from me , and I could not get a Constable to take him , my Lord . And as Spencer took no more than 18 hundred , upon the 6th of September , at 7 in the Morning , my Lord , by Mr. Spencer 's Recommendation , he desired me to go to a Founder , one Mr. Fowler , my Lord . Court . Let us understand you , if possible . Did you Deliver any of your own Iron to the Prisoner ? Williams . Ess , my Lord , ess , I deliver 'd three Tons and a Quarter to Bray , to bring to Mr. Fowler , thro ' Bridge , my Lord , thro ' Bridge , and it was put into his Lighter , my Lord , and he said , he could never get thro ' Bridge this Tide , and I got two Men to aid him , to push him thro ' ; but we could not get thro ' for-the Tide was so strong , that it push 'd us back again , and then he made his Boat fast on the other Side of the Bridge . Court . Then he did get thro ' ? Williams . Ess , ess , my Lord , he got thro ' ; but that was at two a Clock . Council . Did not he make some Excuse , and send you away ? Williams . O ! yes , a great many Excuses , and a Man came to him , and he quitted the Boat , and I staid there most of the time with it when he was gone , and I told him I must go away , and I left the Boat with the Man at the White-Bear , and the Man at the Bear said , the Iron would be safe . Council . Who did you leave in Possession of the Iron ? Williams . No Body , my Lord , I left no Body in Possession , my Lord , but the Man at the Bear , my Lord , said it would be as safe as so much Gold , my Lord , but Bray , my Lord , Bray , took it out of the Ship . Council . Now we have got to the Ship again . But who took it out of the Boat at the Bridge ? Williams . I do n't know that Bray took it out of the Boat , my Lord , but Bray took it out of the Ship , yes , it was Bray , Bray , my Lord , Bray took it out of the Ship ; and I found 5 hundred and a half at Mr. Wood 's , my Lord , and I gave Mr. Wood a Subpoena to be here , my Lord , but he pray 'd to be excus 'd , yes , my Lord , he pray 'd to be excus 'd . I have had a World of Wrong , of Wrong , my Lord , a World of Wrong , yes , my Lord , a World of Wrong have I had , and John West is kept back by this Wood , the Founder , my Lord , and Hutchins is indicted and got to Rochester ; and I am in a dangerous Condition , my Lord , a very dangerous Condition indeed , my Lord , with a Constable ; and here is Ann Darling , my Lord , can give a good Account of this Matter , and I am threaten 'd with my Life , my Lord , by a great many Witnesses , my Lord , and here is a Constable , my Lord , that kept this Man from Justice , and from Judgement , my Lord , from Justice and from Judgement . Pray consider , my Lord , what a sad Condition I am in , a sad Condition indeed , my Lord , a very sad Condition . Mary Shorter . I was at a House , in Monmouth-Street , on the Saturday before Bray was taken , which was on the Wednesday . And Will . Darling came in and said to Bray , Now you can be here at your Liberty , but if I go down to the Water-side I may be taken , for you have brought me into a Praemunire , in stealing this Iron . And what of that ? says Bray , you may keep up two or three Weeks . And says Darling , You sent me to sell the Iron , because you was afraid to go your self ; and all the Answer that Bray made was , What of that ? and what then ? and keep out of the Way . Ann Darling . The Prisoner and my Husband brought five iron Balls to my Room that Night ; and after Supper , the Prisoner told me , my Husband was going out with him all Night , Lord bless me ! says I , what are you going to do ? He said they were going to carry a Captain down to Eriff , and so they went together , and I saw them no more till nine a Clock next Morning . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 30. Elizabeth Gainer , was indicted for stealing a Pewter Quart-pot , the Property of Richard Cook , Nov. 13 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 31. William Moore , was indicted for stealing 15 lb . of Sugar , the Property of William Gerish . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 32. Elizabeth Ran , ( a little Girl ) was indicted for stealing a silver Spoon , two Aprons , four Mobs , twenty Guineas , and twenty-one Shillings , the Goods and Money of Stephen Freeman , in his House , Nov. 24 . Stephen Freeman . The prisoner was my Apprentice , her Work was to make Shoemaker 's-Pegs . She had run away from me several times , and therefore , as I was to go over the Water , I set her to work in the Kitchen , lock 'd the Door , and went out . I return 'd about 6 at Night , and the Prisoner was not to be found , my Drawers were broke open , and my Money and Goods gone . On the Friday following , a Neighbour met her in Cannon-Street , and brought her home to me . I ask 'd her , what it was she broke open the Drawers with ?

Between 10 and 11 at Night , the 31st of October , as I was going home , I met the Prisoner in Wapping , and enquir 'd of him , the Way to my Lodging , for I was a Stranger in Town . He said it I 'd give him any thing , he 'd shew me the Way , I agreed to give him 6 d. He led me a back Way , till we came to a Brandy-Shop ; I found I was wrong , and told him so . He said he brought me thither for a Dram ; I gave him a Dram or two , and went out . He follow 'd , knock 'd me down , and took 4s . a Bill for 5l . 9s . ( dated at Portsmouth , Oct. 6 . 1733. drawn by Christopher Hooper on Anthony Hooper , Payable in London , at 5 Days sight ) and a pair of silk Garters , and the Key of my Chest , out of my Pockets . My Handkerchief was ty 'd about my Neck in a double Knot , and in getting it off , he had like to have strangled me . I cry 'd out , Murder ! and said , Fye upon it , what a sad thing it is , for a Man to be robb 'd in his native Land ! A Woman came out of a Chandler's-Shop with a Candle , and yet , for all that , the Prisoner kept pulling my Handkerchief , 'till he had got it off , and then he run away . The good Woman , I do n't know her Name , took me into a House , and gave me a Farthen 's worth of Small-beer . I was afraid to go home , left I should meet the Prisoner again , and so I stay 'd in that House all Night - I had never seen the Prisoner before , but I had a full View of him in the Brandy-Shop , and am sure he is the same Man . He was taken that Night , I know not how ; but next Morning Tho Ovington , ( the Officer , who took him ) came to enquire for me , and told me , the Prisoner was in Shadwell-Cage . I went thither ; I knew him at first sight , and said , he was the Man who robb 'd me . Prisoner . Wath I the Man ath produthed the Handkerchief before the Juthtith . Curfoy . It was produced by a Woman who went for the Prisoner 's Wife , I think her Name was Jane . Prisoner . But did not a Fellow that wath before the Juthtith own it , and thay , that he gave it to her ?

No ; I met you first in the Street , and we went into the Shop together . Prisoner . Wath nobody elth in the Thop but you and I ? Curfoy . Nobody but the Woman of the Shop . Prisoner . Wath you drunk or thober ? Curfoy . I was not drunk , but I had got a small Cup of Liquor . Grace Thornton . I had been winding Silk all Day , and went down to a Chandler 's Shop in Blue -coat-fields , between 10 and 11 at Night to drink ; I had been there but a few Minutes before I heard a Man cry out Murder ! Its a sad Thing for a Man to be robb 'd in a Christian Land by his own Fellow-natives . I ran out with a Candle , and saw the Prosecutor sitting on the Stones at Brown 's Door , and a Man ( which I believe was the Prisoner ) pulling a Handkerchief off his Neck , and then he ran away . The Prosetor 's Nose was cut , and he was very bloody . He ask 'd me for a little Water ; I told him I 'd give him a Farthing 's worth of Small-beer , and so I lifted him up , but he sell down again , whether it was owing to Drink , or to the Damage he had suffer 'd , I ca n't say ; at last I got him into the Chandler 's Shop , and gave him some Small-beer , and ask 'd him why he did not get a Dram ? He felt in his Pocket , and said he had lost 4s . but hop 'd his Note was safe ; but searching farther , he said that was gone too ; so I left him , and went to bed . The Houses in our Neighbourhood are left out in Tenements to Lodgers ; between one and two , Mr. Ovington , the Beadle , and the Watch , came and knock 'd at our Street-door ; my Husband went down and let 'em in ; they said they came to search for some Fellows that had made a Disturbance ; they went backwards , and saw the Prisoner getting over the Wall in the Yard into an Alley , and there he was taken .

Thomas Ovington , Beadle . Between one and two in the Morning a Woman came to the Watch-house , and said there was a Disturbance in Blue-coat-fields ; I went with the Watch thither , and knock 'd at the Door , and Thornton let us in , and said , the People were got out backwards ; we follow 'd ; the Prisoner was getting over the Wall ; I went into the Alley and found him sitting on a Bench thus - with his Hands on his Knees , as if he had been asleep . John , says I , you must go with me to the Watch-house . Go with you , you Black-guard Dog ? says he . Do you know who you talk to ? I 'd have you to know , Sirrah , that I have got Money , and a 5 l. Note in my Pocket . I made no more Words , but took him away . When he was in the Watch-house he pull 'd a Paper out of his Fob , and said , See here , you Rascal ! you Black-guard Rogue ! here 's a 5 l. Note ! I ask 'd him to let me see it in my Hand , but he refus 'd , and put it up again . Prisoner . Did you find any Note upon me , when you search 'd me in the Morning ? Ovington . No ; I search 'd him only for Arms , for I did not then think the Paper he had shewn me was really such a Note as he said it was . In the Morning the Prosecutor came to see him in the Cage , and said directly , That 's the Man ! He robb 'd me of 4 s. a pair of Garters , a Key , a Handkerchief , and a Note of 5 l. 9 s. Prisoner . One of the Watchmen search 'd me , and found but a Groat in my Pocket , and that he took away . Ovington . I did not see any Watchman search him . Prisoner . I wath going to thee for my Wife , and call 'd in at thith Brandy-thop to drink , and there I thaw the Prothecutor and another Man , like a Thea-saring Man , and they akth 'd me to drink with them , and we had two Half-pinth of Brandy together , and then I went about my Bithineth , and going home there wath a Quarrel , and I went to take a Manth part , and so I wath thent to the Cage .

Deliver your Rings then , says he . I told him I had no Rings neither . Why then give me your Watch , says he ; I toggled at that . Be quick , says he , or you are a dead Man . I gave it him ; they bid me good Night , and rode off . It was so dark that I could not see their Faces so plain as to know them again , so that I can not swear to the Prisoner . I since found my Watch ( but without the Seal ) at Mr . Knot 's a Pawn-broker in New-street . Alice Davis . I was just come out of Place , and wanting a Lodging I was recommended to Kit Henley 's , at the Ship in Peter-street , in St. James 's . The Prisoner and Will .

They came in to drink , and Henley told them he wanted Money to pay his Landlord ; the Prisoner said he had no Money , but he had Money 's worth , and gave him something , but I did not see what it was . The Landlord went out in the Morning and came in again , and brought them some Money , and they paid him 24 s. and I gave an Account of this before Justice Lambert . Charles Knot .

Court . Did they not keep Horses at your Stables ? Henley . Ryland brought a Horse on Thursday Afternoon to my Stable , rode out the same Evening , and return 'd between eleven and twelve at Night . Court . The Girl , Alice Davis , says , there were two Horses , and that you tore the Blanket , and laid a piece upon each . Henley . A Gentleman in East-street kept a Mare at my Stables , and at last he sold her to me ; and that Thursday I lent this Mare to Mr. Grundee , a Mason , and when he brought her home at Night she sweated very much , and I took the Blanket off the Girl 's Bed and threw it over the Mare . Court . What Time did the Mare come home ? Henley . Between seven and nine at Night . Court . Did not you tear the Blanket , and lay part on the Mare , and part on the Horse ? Henley .

Sunday Night being my Watch Night , upon Alice Thompson ( Davis 's ) Information , I went to Henley 's , and seiz 'd him , and Ryland , and the Prisoner , but Ryland made his Escape . I ask 'd Henley where the Mare was , that was there about half an Hour ago ? He said , he did not know , for a Gentleman had taken her out . Henley was sent to Bridewell , and the Prisoner to the Gatehouse . I advised the Prisoner to discover what he knew , for I told him , if he would not , Henley would . He refus 'd for a pretty while , but at last confess 'd he had robb 'd a Gentleman on a Hackney Coach-box , going to Kensington , of a Watch , and about half a Crown in Money . I found out the Coachman , by enquiring what Coach had been robb 'd , and he told me Mr. Lee was his Fare : I went to Mr. Lee , and he describ 'd the Watch to me , and particularly , that in the inside Case , there was the Picture of a Friar killing a Nun . Prisoner . The Constable made me drunk with Punch , and I said any thing . Court . But could you discover Facts which you knew nothing of . James Hawks . Mr. Lee was my Fare .

I came home , and saw him a-Bed between one and two in the Afternoon , and he was violent bad indeed , and he got up between two and three , and between three and four he went out with me . Court . Tho ' he was so violent bad ? Tomson . Yes ; we went to Apothecaries-Hall , to get a Medicine Mr. Henley had given me a Receipt of . They would not sell so small a Quantity there , but directed me to a Chimist 's in the Hay-Market , and the Prisoner was so bad then , that he could not go back for he said , his Ague was very strong upon him . So we took a Boat and went to Mr. Godfrey the Chimist 's , and in the Way home , we met Ryland . Ryland did not go with us then , but came some time after . The Prisoner 's Wife had got some Water-gruel , and Turnips , and Sage-tea ready . Ryland Supp 'd with us , and stay 'd all Night , for he had had some words with his Wife , and would have kill 'd her , but I got between , and parted them , and so he swore he would not go home with her . Prisoner . You saw me find the Watch . Tomson . Next Morning , being Friday , he lay a-Bed 'till nine a Clock , and about ten he got up , and went with me to Tottenham-Court about some Business .

Tomson . No . Court . Nor you ask him ? Tomson . No ; he said nothing to me , nor I to him . Court . That was strange indeed ! Tomson .

She said , No , she was gone out ; and so finding our Design not bearable there , we went away again . Damn it , says Brown , now I think o n't , here 's an old French Gentleman lives hard by , and we can tune him easily ; and upon that we went to Colonel Romane 's , Brown put back the Bolt of the outer Gate , we went to the Door , and knock 'd , the Colonel himself came and open 'd it , I clapp 'd my Foot between the Door and the Threshold , and we all forc 'd in ; Brown with a Cutlace , and Whitlock with a Pistol , struck the Colonel on the Head , and knock 'd him down ; we took a gold Watch out of his Pocket , and a Ring from his Finger . The Maid came up from below with a Candle in her Hand , I suppose the Noise had alarm 'd her ; Will . Black-well went to her , and ask 'd her , where the Plate and Money was ? She told him , she had not liv 'd there long , but believ 'd they might be above . I and Whitlock , took the Colonel with us , and went up into his Room , and rifled it ; we went to break a Trunk open , but he said , Do n't break it , I have the Key in my Pocket . We search 'd but not finding it , he felt in his Pocket himself , and gave it us ; We took out twelve silver Forks , seven Knives with silver Handles , one of them was a small Knife , thirteen silver Spoons , one great silver soop Spoon , eight or nine silver Pennies , a quarter Guinea , some Necklaces , and other Things ; then we tumbled the Beds upside down , a pair of Shoes with silver Buckles stood in the Window , and we took the Buckles out ; we open 'd the Chest of Drawers - the Drawers open 'd , one to the Right-hand and the other to the Left , and took out a Parcel of Linen , and Woman 's Apparel . Court . Where was /Brown ? Mitchell . He was sometimes above and sometimes below . He came up to see how we went on . And row and then gave the Colonel a knock and a Damn , and said , You old Rogue , where 's your Money ? We left the Colonel , and went into his Daughter 's Room ( as I suppose it was ) broke open the Drawers , and took out a Parcel of Head-clothes , and two pair of Scissars , with a Silver-case . Thence we went into the Maid 's Room ; but finding nothing there , we went into another Bye-room , where was a Trunk and a Box ; we broke them open , and took out of the Box , two Gowns and Petticoats . We thought to find some Money in the Trunk , but there was only a soul Shift and 2 or 3 Napkins , which we left there 'till we had searched the other Rooms . We went down to the Colonel , and threaten 'd him hard , to make him discover where his Money was ; we bound his Hands to his Backside , and going down to the Entry , at the Foot of the Stairs , I saw Blackwell buttoning up his Breeches , and the Maid lying with her Coats up . God damn you for a Rogue , says I , you ought to think of something else , at such a time as this . Brown told me , he had found nothing below but seven Tea-spoons . He hit the Colonel on the Head , and putting a Case-knife to his Throat , said , Let 's kill him ! I swore he should not , for it was enough to rob him , and I would never be concern 'd in Murder . And the Maid said to him , Do n't kill my Master , rather kill me . In a Back-room we found some Wine ; and Brown said , there were some Ribs of Lamb below . We sat down , and eat and drank what we thought fit , and then going to get our Goods together , we happen 'd to see a little Closet ; says Brown , I 'll be damn 'd if his Money is not there . But upon search , we found only a pair of Pistols , and a Silver-hilted Sword with a Green-belt - I think it was Green ; says Brown , these will be of Service to us , and so we took them . We pack 'd up what we had got , in several Bundles , and went to see how the Colonel and his Maid did . By the Way we spy 'd a Cupboard . with some Tea and Coffee in it . Says Brown , My Wife drinks Tea , and I 'll take this for her . Then each Man taking his Bundle , I went out first , and left them to lock the Door . And Brown , when he came to me told me , that he had lock 'd it , but whether he did or no , I can not tell . We went into the Fields , and thinking it was too soon to venture into London , we sat down upon our Bundles , and staid till we thought the Watch were gone off . Then we parted , Blackwell and I went to the Water-side , and took a Boat to Pepper-Alley , and walked from thence to White 's , at the Grainge , by six in the Morning . I knock 'd at the Door , Brown 's Wife look 'd out ; I told her , her Husband was coming , and while I was speaking , he and Whitlock came to the Door . White got up , and draw 'd us two Pots of Beer ; I shew 'd him the Tea , and said , Is not this good Tea ? We have had good luck to Night ; for he thought we dealt in Run Tea and Brandy . His Wife , my Wife , Brown 's Wife , and we all Breakfasted together with this Tea ; they said it was very good , and they had never drank better . After Breakfast , we shar 'd the Goods , Blackwell had six Shirts , and two Shirts , for his Share of the Linen , and he sold his Share of the Silks to me , and Whitlock , and Brown , for 14 s. a-piece . I and the two Prisoners left him , and went to sell the Plate to Edward Bodenham , at the Ship Alehouse , in the Old-baily ; Whitlock staid at the Cock , in the Old-Baily , and only I and Brown went to Bodenham 's , for I knew Bodenham would be scrupulous of buying the Plate , if we all three went together ; Well , says Bodenham , have you got any thing for me ? Yes , says I , Here 's a gold Watch . He look 'd on it , 'T is very old , and worn , says he , What 's the Price ? I told him sixteen Guineas . It is not worth near that Money , said he , for I must get something by it , and you know how things are as well as I . At last we agreed for eight Guineas . He ask 'd us , what we had got else ? Then he took us into a little Room , where he Tutors his Watches ; he weigh 'd it , said there was eighty Ounces , and ask 'd us , what we must have ? Says I , 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce , you know what you use to give . Court . How came you to say so ? Mitchell . Because I had sold him Plate before . At last he agreed to give us 24 l. for the Watch and Plate all together , and we took it , because we knew not where else to dispose of it . He did not pay us directly , but said , we must stay an Hour ; he call 'd a Coach , took the Plate with him , and in about an Hour return 'd , and paid us the Money : But , says he , I have had a hard Bargain , and when you come again , you must use me better . So to make him amends , I gave him a silver Buckle , set with Bristol Stones ; we drank a 3 s. Bowl of Punch , when that was empty , we call 'd upon Whitlock at the Cock , and went back together to White 's , where we found Blackwell . We shar 'd the Money , 6 l. a-piece , and I call 'd for some Beer , Damn you , says Blackwell , let 's have some Punch ; White brought a 3 s. Bowl ; it was then about four a Clock . When we had drank it out , Damn you , says Blackwell , I must go over the Water , but I 'll come again ; but we never saw him more . About two Weeks after , I and my Wife went to Bodenbam 's , with this Mourning Ring ; he said it was very light , and he could not afford to give us above 5 s. for it , and we took the Money . Court . What became of the Pistols ? Mitchell . We kept them for our own Use . Court . Had you those Pistols when you were taken ? Mitchell . Yes . Court . How were you apprehended ? Mitchell . I and the two Prisoners took Horse at the White-Horse-Inn , in Westminster , about seven in the Morning ( I forgot the Day of the Month , but it 's within these three Weeks ) we rode directly to Fulham , over the new Bridge to Putney , so to Kingston-Bridge , and thro ' Hampton-Court , to Stains , where we din 'd . There a Man , who knew Whitlock , happening to come in , Damn me , says Whitlock , we shall be blown if we stay here abouts , for this Fellow knew me when I was try 'd in the Country . Upon this , we alter 'd our Design , which was to rob Whitlock 's Uncle . We rid to Black-River - or Black-Water , I do n't know which you call it - We met a Man on Banstead-Heath , says Brown , Let 's tune him . No , says I , our Horses are tir 'd , and we shall lose our Night 's Rest . We put in at the Swan , in a little Town , where we lay ; in the Morning we went to the next Market-Town , drank there , rid thro ' , and return 'd in the Evening to meet the Farmers as they came from Market ; but we got only a pair of silver Buckles : We proceeded to Farnham , lay there , and next Day went for Guilford ; we intended to take the Farmers as they return 'd from thence in the Evening , but while we were in Town , Brown said , he was afraid some Body would know his Mare , and so we should be blown . So we went to Godlirnan ( Godalrnin ) where we baited , and coming out of our Inn in the Evening we met a Man , who ask 'd us which way we were going ? We said , for London , and he pass 'd us . I 'll be damn 'd , says Brown , if this Man has not got Money ; we look 'd after him , and saw him upon his Knees , we thought ( as it prov 'd ) he was tying his Money in the Tail of his Shirt , Brown follow 'd with this other Pistol , and stopp 'd him , the Man , who was a stout Fellow , seiz 'd the Pistol , struggled with Brown , and run off ; but we came up with him again , took two Bags , in which was about 6 l. from him , and then ty 'd him , and rode towards Guilford , but fearing to be pursu 'd , we turn 'd up a Bye-road , and passing by the Green-Man , we saw two Men drinking at the Door . We rode a quarter of a Mile , and waited for them ; when they came up , we stopp 'd them , bound their Hands behind them , took 21 Guineas from one , and 1 Guinea , a Knife , and a Tobacco-box from the other . A little farther we met a Butcher 's Boy , from whom Whitlock took a few Half-pence , and a silver Buckle , which he had in a Bag , and then we rode on for London . But before we got to Kingston our Horses tir 'd ; mine , indeed , was in a much better Condition , for I had chang 'd Horses with one of the Countrymen we had robb 'd . However , before we enter 'd Kingston Town , we turn 'd our Horses all loose in a Turnip-field , and went to the Bell , and enquir 'd for a Waterman ; the People said , they believ 'd we should hardly find a Waterman that would go so late ; but at last a Woman brought one to us , who offer 'd to go for 6 s. we agreed for 5 s. and to find him Beer and Brandy . We went into his Boat , lay upon the Straw , and cover 'd ourselves with the Tilt ; we soon fell asleep , and slept 'till we came to Putney , when two Boats clapp 'd along-side of us , and some Men jump 'd directly into our Boat , and took us napping . I ask 'd for the Constable , surrender 'd myself , was carry 'd before my Lord Palmerston , examin 'd , and made an Evidence . Col. des Romaine . On the 25th of October , about eight at Night , I heard somebody knock ; my Maid , who was below , not going to the Door , I took a Candle and went myself ; as soon as I had open 'd it , a Man rush 'd in upon me , seiz 'd me by the Shoulder , and swore , if I made a Noise he 'd shoot me dead ; he was follow 'd by three more , one of whom struck me on the Head with a Cutlace , I cry 'd Murder ! Help ! and call 'd to my Maid , Veron Curtis - Veron call my Men ! bid 'em bring my Pistols , in hopes to have made the Russians believe I had Men in the House , but they did not regard it . Damn him , says one , beat his Brains out ; and presently I receiv 'd a Blow on my Head with the Butt-end of a Pistol ; the Blood follow 'd a-pace , and I fell to the Ground . They rissed me ; took a gold Watch out of my Pocket ; I lost a Ring from my Finger , but , being in a Surprize , I do n't know how it went . I had in my left Fob fix Guineas and a half , in a Purse , which I thrust under the Matt by the Door . They brought my Breeches down to my Knees , to search me , and took away some Silver , I ca n't say how much , but I believe there might be 15 or 16 s. They ty 'd my Hands behind me , and two of them dragg 'd me up Stairs , another holding me by the Shoulder , with a Pistol in his Hand , to make me shew them where my Money was - They bid me be hush , or they 'd shoot me . Court . Did they all three stay in your Room above ? Colonel . I think so - I think one held me , and two search 'd the Room . They first open 'd a Trunk with a double Cover ; there was a Box in it with Plate ; they took the Box out , but did not open the upper Cover , within which I had 45 Guineas and a half . I still deny 'd telling them where my Money was , in hopes they would not find it ; upon which they again struck me on the Head with a Pistol - They open 'd a Press , and threw some Things out ; they took two Pistols out of the Closet - these are the same - and a silver hilted Sword with a green Belt . One of them said he 'd break the Hilt off , but another said , No , there was no need . They carry 'd me into another Room , where they broke open another Press , but I did not see what they took out of it . Then they made me go down with them , and at the Foot of the Stairs I saw my Maid sitting on the Ground , with part of her Coats up , and a Man rising from her , and putting up his Breeches . They ty 'd my Hands so hard to my Back as put me to great Pain . They plac 'd me by the Maid ; put a Napkin and the Maid 's Petticoat over my Head , so that I was almost stifled - Some of them went into the Parlour , and up Stairs - One , coming down again , gave me several Strokes , and said , O you old Rogue , you said you had no Money ! Another laid his Hand on my Head , and put something under the Petticoat , which I thought was a Hanger , but Mitchell says it was this Knife . Mitchell . Yes , this is the Knife , and it was Whitlock that put it under the Petticoat . Colonel . I begg 'd them to loosen my Wrists , and thought one of them was going to do so , but he only took the Buttons out of my Sleeves . As my Head was cover 'd , I could indeed hear them walk about , and speak to the Maid , but could not distinguish what they said . I remain 'd thus in the greatest Misery 'till three in the Morning , when hearing no Noise , I told the Maid I believ 'd they were gone . She said , Hush ! do n't make a Noise ! they are not gone yet . They certainly are , says I , have not you the Use of your Fingers ? She said , she believ 'd she had . I bid her see if she could not untie my Hands . She said , her own Hands were not quite at Liberty , but she would try what she could do ; and so she did , but it was near a quarter of an Hour before she could loosen the Cord . But , Sir , says she , for God 's sake do n't stir yet , for I am afraid they are not gone ; God has preserv 'd your Life hitherto , and why will you run the Hazard of losing it at last ? However , as I believ 'd they were gone , I went into the Passage , and saw a Light in the Fore-Room , but nobody was there . I found the Door drawn to , but not lock 'd , and the Key was left on the Rail without Side . I bolted the Door , and desir 'd her to call for Help , but she said , she did not dare go yet , for fear they should kill her . I went myself to a Closet-Window , call 'd to a Gardener , and told him what had happen 'd ; he promis 'd to come , but did not , tho ' I call 'd him again . The Maid was fearful of being left alone , and follow 'd me about the House , wherever I went . Court . Look on the Prisoners , Sir , - Do you know either of 'em ? Colonel . I did not then know either of them , but , on Recollection , I believe Brown was the Man who held me - I ca n't say that I remember any thing of the other . I saw but four in all , and for the other three , I mostly saw their Backs - two of them went before me with a Candle . Brown . You say I was up Stairs - Pray ask Mitchell whether I went up or not ? Mitchell . You were sometimes up , and sometimes down - Sometimes you held the Colonel by the Shoulder , and sometimes you gave him a Knock with a Pistol . Veron Curtis . Between eight and nine somebody knock 'd , as my Master said , tho ' I did not hear it , but I heard the Dog bark , and listening , heard the Door open , and presently my Master cry 'd out Murder ! come up , Veron , and call the Men . I went up , and found him lying in the Entry all over in a goar Blood , with four Men about him . I know Whitlock - he in the grey Waistcoat , was one of them . Another of them , who was a tall Man , stept up to me , took me by the Hand , and swore , if I spoke a Word he 'd shoot me thro ' the Head ; Whitlock had a naked Hanger in his Hand , and he ( I think it was he ) ask 'd me where the Plate was ? I told him I was a new Servant , and knew of no more than six Spoons and Forks that were in the Kitchen . They rifled my Master , and ty 'd my Hands behind me , and three of them took him up Stairs . The tall Man staid below , and ask 'd me where the Candles were ? I told him , in the Kitchen ; and if he would let me have my Hands loose , I would fetch some . No , he would not do that , but carry 'd me down , and made me shew him where they were . He took some , and lighted one at the Fire , and taking me up again , carry 'd me into the Parlour , where he set me in a Chair , with my Hands ty 'd behind me , and abus 'd me in a gross Manner . Whitlock afterwards came down , and us 'd me as ill as the other had done - I saw but four Men in all . - Court . What do you know of their Eating and drinking ? Curtis . I had dress 'd a Neck of Mutton , part of it was left . There were three Bricks in the House , and a Pound of Butter ; they eat the Mutton , and best part of the Butter , and two Quartern-Bricks ; and one of them said , he 'd go and carry a Bottle to the Man that held their Horses . Whitlock . Did I go up ? Curtis . I think they all went up , but the tall Man , who took hold of me first ; and when Whitlock came down , he and the tall Man kept me Prisoner in the Room by Turns . Whitlock . You said I seiz 'd you first . Curtis . No ; the tall Man seiz 'd me , and Whitlock came up with a naked Hanger , and swore if I would not discover where the Plate was , I should be shot . A quilted Petticoat that I had been working , was put-over my Master 's Head , and I had a white Handkerchief round my Head . Whitlock said , the best Way would be to kill the Master , and gag the Maid , and he took a Knife to cut my Master 's Throat . For God 's sake , says I , do n't kill my Master , but rather kill me ; and the others preventing him , Why then , God damn them , says he , gag them both down close . Brown . Did not you deny me when I was brought to Newgate ? Curtis . It was duskish then , and I could not see very well , but as soon as I had a Candle , I said to the best of my Knowledge you was one of the Men I saw in the Entry when I first came up . Brown . What did you say to Mr. Fisher , at Paddington , when he bid you have a Care , or you 'd hang yourself ? Curtis . I said , if I knew any Thing of you before , it was the Day before Michaelmas , when you came to our Door with a Couple of Geese , and I shew 'd them to my Master . Court . Do you believe him to be the Man who brought the Geese ? Curtis . Yes . Court . Now it lies harder upon you . [ To Brown . ] Jane Cheny , Pawnbroker . I had this Petticoat and Table-cloth from Brown ; he pledg 'd them in the Name of William Moore , on the 23d of November ; and this Brocade I had of his Wife . Colonel . This Petticoat belongs to my Daughter ; it was taken away with the rest of the Things when my House was broke open . John Garscee . The same Night the Robbery was committed , Mitchell and the two Prisoners were at my House , and call 'd for a quartern of Cherry Brandy . Brown ask 'd me to go out with them , and said , we should never want Money afterwards . I told him , No ; for tho ' I had seen a great deal of the World , I was now got into another Way . Then he said , it was no Matter , and ask 'd me if I knew Long Will . What Will . Blackwell ? says I , Yes , I believe he 's at his Mother 's , hard by . He desir 'd me to send for him , and while we were talking about it , Long Will . Came in ; they shook Hands with him , went up Stairs together , had a 3 s. Bowl of Punch , and went away about seven or later . Next Morning one Mr. Berry came and told me of the Robbery . Henry Maschal . The Prisoner and Mitchell were taken asleep in a Boat on the Water by Putney . * This Pistol was taken from Brown - this from Whitlock - and this other from Mitchell . * They were pursued to Kingston , but being gone from thence by Water , the Pursuers rode on to Putney . Colonel . And these two Pistols which were found upon them are mine , and the same I lost . - White . Brown and Mitchell lodg 'd at my House . Court . Do you know of any Tea that Brown brought to your House ? - White . No . Court . No ? White . Yes ; I remember Brown brought some Tea one Morning , but I ca n't be certain as to the time . Court . Do you remember you drank Tea at any time when the Prisoners , and Mitchell , and another were in Company with you at your House ? White . Yes ; and there was my Husband , and Brown 's Wife , and Mitchell 's Wife . Brown 's Defence . Brown . While I liv 'd at Paddington , Mitchell came to me , and said , he was in an Information , and begg 'd me to let him stay with me , and he staid three or four Days ; but there was a good 'Squire that liv 'd next Door , and his Servants seeing Mitchell , they told me , the 'Squire was angry that I let such a loose Fellow lodge with me ; I acquainted Mitchell with it , and he said , if I 'd lend him a Great coat , he 'd go off , and so he did . In two or three Weeks after , I went and lodged at White 's , and Mitchell lodg 'd there at the same time ; He was in a great deal of Trouble , and said , he wished I would go to such and such Places . I told him , I had stain 'd my Character already , and did not care to bring my self into a Scrape again . He told me , he had been in a great many Concerns himself , and if he was taken , he was sure to be a dead Man , and therefore he would swear any Man 's Life away to save his own , for he did not care who he was an Evidence against . John Harvey . I have known Brown five or six Years , he lodged in a House where I had liv 'd fifteen Years ; I never heard an Oath come out of his Mouth , nor any Body speak ill of him . Court . He says himself , that his Character was stain 'd . Harvey . It 's three Years since I was acquainted with him . John Toser . I have known him above three Years , he bought Fowls and Rabbets at Leaden-Hall Market , and sold them about the Streets , and behaved himself very modestly and handsomely . Thomas Crosby . He lived in our Neighbourhood a Year and a Half ago , and then I believ 'd him to be very honest . George Pardon . I have known him four Years , and never heard any ill of him . Whitlock 's Defence . Whitlock . Pray ask the Constable , if he took the Colonel 's Pistols from me ? Constable . I saw it taken out of Whitlock 's Pocket at Putney , and is Pocket was pull 'd off in getting it out . Court . Now you have it with a Circumstance . Whitlock . Here 's George Sutton can give an Account of me . George Sutton . I know him only by his being in Goal . Henry Sutton . ( George Sutton 's Father ) The Colonel swore to my Son as one that was in the Robbery . Justice Deveil . George Sutton having been in a great many Robberies , was brought before me on Suspicion of being concern 'd in this , the Colonel observ 'd him very narrowly , and swore that to the best of his Knowledge , he believ 'd him to be one of the 4 that broke into his House - Those were his very Words , To the best of his Knowledge . Sutton pretended that he lay at a House in St. Giles 's that Night , but a Constable who the same Night had search 'd every Room of that House , declared that Sutton was not there . Mary Sutton . The Colonel charged my Son . Court . There 's no doubt of it ; but upon Recollection he found his mistake . Whitlock . Justice Deveil offer 'd Sutton a Purse of Guineas to be an Evidence . G. Sutton . He said it would be Money in my Way if I would turn Evidence . Justice Deveil . I only told him of the King 's Reward . George Sutton . It was sworn that I was a disorderly Person , and so you sent me to Tothill-Bridewell , and you told me , it I knew any thing of this Affair , and would make a Discovery , there was a Reward in the Proclamation . Court . And any other might have said the same . Jane Wood . Whitlock has work 'd 4 times for my Husband . The first was 12 Years ago , and the last 2 Months ago , and he was very Faithful to his Trust . Daniel Atkins . I have known him 5 or 6 Years , and never knew any thing amiss of him - I saw him 7 or 8 Weeks ago - He 's a Farrier , and I am a Sawyer . William Gent . Two Years ago he lodg 'd in the same House with me , and went out to Work every Morning . John Hunt . I have known him four or five Years , at the Bull and Bell in Finsbury , and at his Brother 's in Rag-Fair , and never heard any hurt of him . Henry Fleet . Nor I , and I have known him from a Child . Thomas Gardner . He work 'd with me sometime ago . Court . How long ago ? Thomas Gardner . Ten Years - but he came and drank a Bowl of Punch with me , within these 6 Weeks . Whitlock . I see a Gentleman here in Court . that knows me . Mr. Whigly . He used to shoe my Horses - I know nothing more of him , but that about 18 Months ago , he broke out of the New-Goal . The Jury found them Guilty . Death . 60. Edward Bodenham , was indicted , for that , whereas , at this Sessions , William Brown , and Joseph Whitlock , of Paddington , were try 'd for breaking and entring the House of James des Romaine , Esq ; and stealing a Gold-watch , a silver Snuff-box , 3 Gold-rings set with Stones , 1 gold Mourning-ring , 13 silver Spoons , 12 Silver Forks , 7 Knives , with silver Hasts , 1 silver Soop Ladle , 4 silver Salts , 8 silver Tea spoons , 2 Pistols mounted with silver and Steel , 1 silver hilted Sword , 1 silk damask Night-gown , 20 Holland Shirts , 6 Holland Sheets , and 52 Guineas , and 17 s. the Goods and Money of James des Romaine , Esq ; and 4 silk damask Gowns , 3 silk Petticoats , 10 Holland Smocks , 4 Suits of lac 'd Head-Clothes , 1 Cloth-cloak , and 1 silver Buckle set with Bristol Stones , the Goods of Ann des Romaine Spinster , on the 25th of October , about 8 at Night , and were duly convicted .

Ralph Mitchell . On Thursday Night the 25th of October , Will . Brown , Jo . Whitlock , Will . Blackwell , and I broke Colonel Romaine 's House at Paddington , and stole a gold Watch , a large Parcel of Plate , and other Things , of which Brown and Whitlock were convicted here last Wednesday . On Friday October 26 ( the Day after the Fact ) Brown and Whitlock , and I went from Mr. White 's in Grainge-road , near Newington-butts , with the gold Watch and the Plate , to the Cock in the Old-Baily , where we left Whitlock , and then Brown and I went with the Goods to the Prisoner 's House , the ship in the Old-Baily . We left Whitlock , because I knew the Prisoner would be scrupulous of dealing with so many at a time . Court . Then you were acquainted with the Prisoner ? Mitchell . Yes , I had dealt with him several times before , and especially in Watches that I had stole out of Ships in the River ; and he used to say , those were the safest Goods to deal in , because the Owners were going to Sea , and could seldom stay long enough to prosecute ; so that he was in no Danger on that Account ; and he always desir 'd me to be true to him , and not bring him into any Trouble - And so , as I was saying , Brown and I went to his House at the Ship , and turn 'd into a little Box on the left Hand , where he presently came to us , and ask 'd if we had got any Thing for him ? Yes , says I , We have a gold Watch - shew it him , Brown . So the Watch was produc 'd , and I told him the Price was 16 Guineas . 16 Guineas ? says he , I ca n't afford near that Money ; 't is very old ; the Gold is but thin , and the Watch is worth but little more than the Gold weights . We agreed to take eight Guineas . He ask 'd me what else we had got ? I told him some Plate ; we shew 'd it him ; he took us into a little private Room , where he Doctors his Watches , and weigh 'd it - There was 3 silver Salts - We stole 4 , but we sold but 3 to him - 12 silver Forks , 6 Knives with silver Handles , and 1 little Knife with a silver Handle , 13 silver Spoons , 1 large silver soop Spoon , and a silver Hilt of a Sword . These are all I remember we carry 'd at that Time ; and as for the tea Spoons , the Women shar 'd them among themselves . He weigh 'd the Plate , and said there was 80 Ounces . We trusted to him for that , for we did not understand the Weights . Then the Clerk of the Arraigns read the Record of the Conviction of Brown and Whitlock , by which it appear 'd that all these Goods ( among others ) were stolen by them out of Colonel des Romaine 's House . Mitchell . The Prisoner was a little suspicious of Brown , because he was a new Face . I know , says he to me , I can trust you well enough , but I do n't know whether I can trust that other Man . O ! says I , Brown is a very honest Fellow - he has been transported . Has he , Faith ? says the Prisoner , nay then there 's no Danger - we are all right ! - well , what must I give you for this Plate ? You know the Price , says I , what you always give - 4 s. 6 d. and Ounce . Then , says he , the Plate and the Watch together comes to just 24 l. Court . Did you cast it up ? Mitchell . No , we trusted to his Reckoning , as well as to his Weights . He bid us go in and take a 3 s. Bowl of Punch , and he 'd bring us the Money before it was out . He call 'd a Coach , and took the Plate with him , and in about an Hour came back , drank Punch with us , and paid us 24 l. Now , says he , I hope you 'll be true , and bring me into no Trouble - I have had a Bargain of this ! - I question whether I shall make my Money o n't again - You must use me better next time . He complain 'd so much of hard Dealing , that I took out of my Pocket a silver Buckle set with Bristol Stones , and made him a Present of it . Court . Look on that Buckle . Mitchell . Aye , this is the same . Court . Where did you get it ? Mitchell . We took it among the other Things we found in Col. Romaine 's House - The Prisoner having paid us the Money , we call 'd upon Whitlock at the Cock , and all three went back to Whtie 's , where we shar 'd the Money with Long Will . who was concern 'd with us in the Fact . About a Fortnight after this , I and my Wife went to the Prisoner 's , and sold him a gold Mourning-ring , it had the Name of Ann des Romaine engrav 'd on the Out-side of it , he gave us a Crown for it ; and this too we took from Colonel Romaine 's - The Prisoner told me he had been try 'd ( or taken up ) once or twice , but he knew how to get such things off . Prisoner . Were all the Knives sold to me , on the Friday , with the rest of the Plate ? Mitchell . Yes . Prisoner . Were the Knives out of the Handles ? Mitchell . Yes . Prisoner . Did I go into the little Place with you , Mitchell . Yes . Prisoner . Was 24 l. all the Money that was given ? Mitchell . Yes - I sold it for 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce , and you said it weigh 'd 80 Ounces . Court . Eighty Ounces at 4s . 6 d. and 8 l. for the Watch , comes to more than 24l . Mitchell . I do n't know as to that , but I am sure we had not a Farthing more of him . Prisoner . Was not you at my House , from the time you sold the Plate , to the time you brought the Mourning-ring ? Mitchell . Yes , I was with Whitlock when he came to you to get his Watch mended . Prisoner . But did not you come on the Saturday ( the very Day after you sold me the Plate ) and receive 3 l. more ? Mitchell . No , I receiv 'd but 24 l. on Friday , and not a Farthing afterwards . Prisoner . The Plate I bought on Friday , weigh 'd but 75 Ounces , for the Knife-handles were not weigh 'd then , because I had no Fire , and could not take the Knives out . The Watch was worth no more than the Gold weigh 'd , and I allow 'd but 7 l. for it , and so the Watch and Plate came to 24 l. 12 s. but they insisted upon 25 l. because it was even Money , and 25 l. I paid them that Day , and 3 l. the next Day for the Handles . Court . But 24 l. 12 s. was more than the Watch and 75 Ounces of Plate , came to , at your Price . John Boice . On the 21st of November , by my Lord Mayor 's Order , I went with Justice Deveil , and Col. des Romaine , to search the Prisoner 's House . The Justice read a Paper to the Prisoner , in which all the Goods the Colonel had lost , were distinctly mentioned , and the Prisoner positively deny 'd that he had had any such Goods in his House - I found this Buckle in a Drawer , and took it out , and laid it upon a Table . Going back to my Lord Mayor 's , I ask 'd Mitchell , if he knew any thing of such a Buckle ? he said , Yes . I return 'd to the Prisoner 's House , to fetch it , but it was remov 'd , I ask 'd his Wife where it was , she said , she believ 'd we had taken it with us ; but I pretending if she would help me to it , I could procure her Husband to be admitted to Bail , she took it out of a Drawer , and gave it me . Lucy Montreasure . This is my Buckle . It was lost from Col. des Romaine 's . Prisoner . By what particular Mark do you know it ? Mrs. Montreasure . The Hook had been broke in this Place , and was afterwards mended . Phillis Mitchell . I went with my Husband , when he sold this Mourning-ring to the Prisoner , I ask 'd the Prisoner if he could help me to a Ring for my own wearing , he said he could have done it , if I had come but an Hoursooner , for he had just parted with a little Diamond-ring , that would have come cheap , and he would have sold it me for 3 or 4 Shillings profit , because he got by my Husband . I told him I did not care to wear that Mourning Ring , because I knew how it was come by . Court . Was that in his hearing ? Phillis . Yes , and my Husband told him , it was got with the rest of the Things at Paddington ; we drank 18 Penny worth of Punch , and had some roast Veal from the Cook 's for dinner . Mitchell . I might say so to the Prisoner , but I ca n't remember positively whether I did or no - I know they were talking about the Ring when I went to fetch the 6 Pennyworth of roast Veal . Prisoner . Did not I ask if the Ring was stole ? Phillis . I do n't remember such a Question . Prisoner . Pray , my Lord , let her be examin 'd a-part . [ Then Ralph Mitchell withdrew . ] Prisoner . Where was the Ring weigh 'd ? Phillis . It was not weigh 'd at all that I saw ; you gave 5 s. for it , and I gave you 2 Guineas worth of Silver for 2 Guineas . Prisoner . Pray ask her how long she has been marry 'd ? Court . I can not ask her that . [ Then her Husband was call 'd in again . ] Prisoner . Did your Wife see the Ring weigh 'd ? R. Mitchell . I do n't know that it was weigh 'd at all . Court . He agrees with his Wife . Mr. Boise again . When we ask 'd the Prisoner for several Things in the Catalogue , he shuffled , and said , he was a Dealer , and might have bought such Things , but did not know that he had . Prisoner to Mitchell . Did not Brown sell me some Buttons and a Watch that Day you were marry 'd , which was 3 Days before you were taken ? Mitchell . I do n't know ; I was gone for the Veal . Prisoner . I ask 'd if the Watch was honestly come by , and if no House was broke open ? for otherwise I would not buy it for the World ; and you said that Brown brought the Watch from Dover . Mitchell , I said the Watch came off the Water ; and you said you was not afraid to buy such Watches , because there was seldom any Prosecutions on those Accounts - You and I have often had Dealings together . Prisoner . And you frequently came to my House , did you ? Mitchell . Frequently ! I came as ofton as I had Occasion - I sold you a silver Tankard not long ago , for 5l . - My first Acquaintance with you was by means of Ned Wilcox , who then kept a Brandy-Shop in Nightingal-lane , and afterwards went to live in Charterhouse-lane , but I believe he is dead now , for I have not seen him this Twelvemonth . Court . Colonel , when your House was broke open did you lose a gold Watch ? Colonel . Yes . Court . And a mourning Ring ? Colonel . Yes . Court . Was any Name engrav 'd on it ? Colonel . Yes , Ann des Romaine . Court . Any Plate ? Colonel . 13 silver Spoons , a silver soop Ladle , 12 silver Forks , 7 silver hasted Knives , 4 silver Salts , and 1 silver hilted Sword - These were my Goods . Court . Any Buckles ? Colonel . A silver Buckle set with Bristol Stones . Court . Whose Property was that ? Colonel . This Lady ( Lucy Montreasure 's ) I bought it for her . Prisoner . I have no private Room . The Place I carry 'd them into was the Shop where I keep my Watches . Mitchell . But there were Curtains to the Window , and he said , Draw the Curtains and then nobody can see us . Prisoner . I weigh 'd the Gold of the Watch , and told them it weigh 'd but 7l . 10s . as for the Inside ( as it was a large old Watch ) it was not worth above 15 or 16 s. When they shew 'd me the Box of Plate , I said , I hoped no House had been broke open , and if there had , I would not meddle with it for the World , for I had often been in Trouble . There was no Arms nor Cypher on the Plate . There was not above 1 third of it Sterling . It weigh 'd 75 Ounces , and , with the Watch , came to 24 l. 12 s. They insisted on 25 l. which I paid them . When Mitchell went out , Brown told me he brought it from Dover , to sell for a Person there . Next Day in the Evening , they came to see the Handles weigh 'd ( for I could not take the Knives out of them before ; ) they weigh 'd 13 Ounces , and I paid them 3l . 1s . 6d . 3 or 4 Days before they were apprehended Mitchell and his Wife brought me a mourning Ring - they were marry 'd that Day - and Brown brought me some silver Buttons and a Watch . Court . And could not you read the Name on the Ring ? Prisoner . Its possible I might read Ann des Romaine upon it , and yet might think nothing of the Robbery . Court . But was not the Story of Col. Romaine 's Loss very strong then ? Prisoner . Yes , it was so ; and I had heard much Talk about it , but really I did not think of it when I bought the Goods . Juryman . Had not you one of the Warnings that were given out on this Occasion ? - for its common to send them to Watchmakers , as well as to Goldsmiths . Prisoner . I ca n't tell but I might have had seen an Advertisement in the House , but I ca n't remember that I had seen it , or if I had seen it I had forgot the Particulars - O here is my Girl ! she has brought the Book I sent for - This is the Book where I set down what I buy - Court . This Book is no Evidence , but you may refresh your Memory with it . Prisoner . Here is - 'Oct . 26 . Bought 75 ' Ounces of old Silver , and an old gold ' Watch , large Size ; the Watch for 7l . ' and the Silver for 18l . 12s . ' Court . Of whom . Prisoner . 'Of Mr. Mitchell - the 27th ' Bought 13 Ounces of old Silver , of Mr. ' Mitchell for 3l . 1s . 6d . Then here 's the ' Day they were marry 'd , bought an old ' silver Watch of Mr. Brown , Mr. Mitchell 's ' Friend , for 2l . 2s . and some old silver ' Buttons . ' William Plant . I have known the Prisoner ever since he was Apprentice to Mr. Watts , in Fleetstreet , which is 14 or 15 Years ago ; I liv 'd over-against him , he had the Character of an honest fair dealing Man , 'till two Years ago ; but since - I have heard he has been taken up for receiving stolen Goods . Samuel Thorn . I have known him 12 Years ; my Master lodg 'd 2 Years in his House when he liv 'd in Nevill's-Alley . He had the Character of a fair Dealer - no ways amiss - in the way of his Calling . Court . Did you never hear of his receiving stolen Goods ? Thorn . I have indeed heard some such thing , but do not know it . William Edlin . I have done Business for him , and found him a fair Dealer . Tho ' I ca n't I say but things have been whisper 'd about - and so forth - of his buying Goods of ill People . - Grace . I have known him 25 Years , his Character was good - when I first knew him - I have dealt with him at a Market Price . And have trusted him with Rings , and once with a gold Watch - I never heard any ill of him , more than from his own Mouth ; he told me himself he had been taken up upon an Affair . Prisoner . Yes , I was taken up twice this Summer , but acquitted - I was put in an Information about a gold Watch , but I gave 400 l. Bail , and nobody appear 'd against me - and when any of these Rogues are apprehended , they make a common Practice of informing against me - I hope the Court will observe the Price I gave - Mitchell has been burnt in the Hand here , and his Wife has had 2 Husbands hang 'd . The Jury found him guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 61. William Johnson , of Edmonton , was indicted for unlawfully hunting , stealing , and carrying away ( with Robert Hill , not yet taken ) a sallow Deer , value 8l . and a fallow Fawn , value 20 s. in a Park enclos 'd with a Fence , where Deer are usually kept , the Property of Sir Jeremiah Sambrook , Baronet , after the 1st of June , 1723. that is to say , on the 12th of June last . George Brice . I am Keeper of Sir Jeremiah Sambrooke 's Park , where Deer have been kept for 4 Years past . On the 13th of June in the Morning , as I was walking in the Park , I found a Brace of Deer kill 'd , and miss 'd a Leash , 2 white fallow Deer , and 1 red tame Deer ; I went to the Park-pales , and found 2 of them broken down ; I took Joseph Burgess on Suspicion . Joseph Burgess . I fell into the Prisoner 's Company the first Day that I went into the Country - It was at the Two Brewers at Winchmore-hill , where I call 'd for half a Pint of Two-penny , and having drank it , was going away , when the Prisoner and one Hill came to the Door with a Brace of Greyhounds , and a Bob-tail Dog . Says I , These Dogs look as if they would run well ; and upon saying so , the Prisoner drank to me - We had 3 Pots together , they paid for 2 , and I for 1 . Then the Prisoner , who had 3 Horse in the Yard , mounted , and rid off ; and Hill told me , if I had a Mind to see the Dogs run , I might , in a little Time , and not far off . I said , if I could see it in half an Hour , I should be very willing ; I went with him ; we came up with the Prisoner , and passing by an Alehouse , says I , Let 's have a Pot here . No , says the Prisoner , that 's a House the Keepers use . This gave me the first Suspicion of their being upon an ill Design . We pass 'd a great white Gate that look 'd like a Coach-way , and 10 or 12 Yards beyond , I saw the Park-pales . I hope , says I , you are not going in here , for I never was in any such Affair in my Life , and would not be concern 'd for 100l . But I could not tell what to do , for it was dark , and I was a Stranger , and did not know my Way back . The Prisoner took 2 Slips [ made 2 Nooses ] to fasten the 2 Greyhounds , and bidding me hold 'em , he jump 'd over the Pales , and he within and Hill without , broke 2 of 'em down , and they both went into the Park , and the Dogs run after , for I was not able to hold 'em . They came back in 2 Hours , and brought out 2 Deer ; I was a white fallow Deer , and the other a red . Hill went in again , and the Prisoner desir 'd me to help load 'em ; he cut their Heads off , and we put the Bodies into Sacks , and so ty 'd them upon the Horse ; but my Heart ached all the while . I thought they were very tedious about every thing they did , and wonder 'd they made no more haste - The Prisoner said , he knew by the Bite which Dog it was that kill 'd the Deer - At last Hill came out again with a live Pawn in his Arms , and we went away together - I ask 'd them the Way to Edmonton ; they directed me , and so we parted , and I never got the Value of a Farthing from them . I went to Work next Day at Winchmore-hill , but I was so uneasy , that I could hardly eat or drink , or sleep for a Fortnight afterward - I have been threaten 'd to be shot if I appear 'd as an Evidence . Prisoner . Were the Dogs mine ? Burgess . I thought so - you call 'd them by their Names ; and on the 6th of Feb. the Friday before I was taken , I saw you with the same Dogs , and 2 Deer before you , going to London . Prisoner . What Colour were the Dogs ? Burgess . Liver-colour and White , and the Bob-tail Dog was red . William Burley . I seiz 'd the Prisoner in Buckler's-bury , and told him I had a Warrant to apprehend him for Deer-stealing . I took him from his House , and held him by the Wrist while another took 2 Pistols out of his Pocket . But - Turner , one of the Prisoner 's Accomplices , came and rescu 'd him from us , and he got as far as Dowgate , where he shot a Man ; but as soon as the Prisoner got from us , we secur 'd Turner * , and he is now in Newgate . * Turner is order 'd to remain till next Sessions , to be try 'd for the Rescue , which is a capital Offence . Prisoner . What Clothes had I on , when I went into the Park ? Burgess . Brown Clothes , and the same you had on when I afterwards met you in Shoreditch , and you said you was going over the Water with Deer . Prisoner . Had I any Arms ? Burgess . You had a Gun , and Hill said he had Pistols , but I did not see them . Then , by Order of the Court , the Act was read , by which it is enacted , `` That after the first Day of June , 1723. whatever Persons , arm 'd with offensive Weapons , and having their Faces black 'd , or otherwise disguis 'd , shall appear in any Forest , Park , or Grounds inclos 'd with any Wall or Fence wherein Deer are usually kept , or any Warren where Hares or Conies are kept , or in any Highway , Heath or Down , or unlawfully hunt , kill , or steal any red or fallow Deer , or rob any Warren , or steal Fish out of any Pond , or maliciously break down the Head of any Fish-pond , or kill or wound Cattle , or set Fire to any House or Out-house , or Stack of Hay or Corn , or cut down , or otherwise destroy Trees planted for Shelter or Profit , or shall maliciously shoot at any Person , or send a Letter demanding Money , or other valueable Things , or shall rescue any Person in Custody of an Officer ; for such an Offence , or by Gift or Promise procure any one to join with them , shall be deem 'd guilty of Felony , without Benefit of Clergy , and shall sister Death as Felons so convicted . '' The Jury found the Prisoner guilty . Death . He was a second time indicted for the Murder of James Taaman , by maliciously discharging a Pistol loaded with Powder and Bullets , and thereby giving him one mortal Wound in the left Side of his Neck , of the Length of half an Inch , and Depth of 4 Inches , on the 26th of October last , of which he languish 'd till the next Day , and then dy 'd . He was a third time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . John Chalkley . The People cry 'd out A Highwayman ! The Deceas 'd laid hold of the Prisoner , and the Prisoner turn 'd about and shot him . We follow 'd the Prisoner into Hand-court , over-against the Steel-yard , and there took him - I think the Prisoner is the Man , but I ca n't swear it positively . Robert Simmonds . The Mob cry 'd , Stop Thief ! Stop Highwayman ! The Deceas 'd follow 'd the Prisoner , and catch 'd at him 2 or 3 times , to take him , and the Prisoner turn 'd about and shot him . Prisoner . Did not he strike me ? Simmonds . Not as I saw - The Prisoner ran up Hand-Court , I catch 'd up a Hammer in a Farrier 's Shop , and threw after him , but missing my Aim , I follow 'd , overtook him , and turning about , met him full ; he snapp 'd a Pistol at me , but it would not go off , and I knock 'd him down with a Whip . Nicholas Crossby , Farrier . I had a Shoe in the Fire when I heard the Noise ; the Prisoner came by with 2 Pistols , and somebody said , Have a Care ! Some threw Stones at the Prisoner , and I said to him , Friend , you had better surrender . By God , says he , I 'll shoot the first Man that touches me . As he spoke , the Deceas 'd catch 'd hold of his Coat , and the Prisoner turn 'd about and shot him under the Ear . Prisoner . Did not you throw a red-hot Shoe at me ? Crossby . No ; but when he was taken in Hand-court , he was very obstropolus , and I told him , if he would not be quiet , I 'd run the Shoe thro ' his Head . Mr. Woodham , Surgeon . I was sent for by the Coroner , to view the Deceas 'd - the Ball enter 'd on the left Side of the Neck , and broke the Vertebrae . I took out these 3 Pieces of the Bone , but could not find the Ball . I heard he liv 'd from 4 in the Afternoon till 9 next Morning , and , I believe , that Wound was the Cause of his Death . The Prisoner 's Defence . John Shuttleworth . I saw Mr. Burley knock the Prisoner off his Horse , in Buckler's-bury , and another took hold of his Arms thus - and took 2 Pistols out of his Pocket - but he , some how , got loose again , and pull 'd out a long Knife at Burley , and Burley struck at his Legs , but he made off , and ran down by the Tower-royal to Dowgate ; the Mob follow 'd , and call 'd , Stop Highwayman ! Stop Thief ! and then he shot the Deceas 'd . Court . Why ? Shuttleworth . Because the Deceas 'd went to take him ; but , in my Opinion , he did not die of that Wound - for his Skull was cut by his falling with his Head upon the Stones . Court . How came he to fall ? Shuttleworth . By being shot . Court . Sir , do you banter the Court ? John Corderoy . The Prisoner was taken in Buckler's-bury , but getting off again , he turn 'd down Size-lane to the Tower-royal , so to College-hill , and thro ' Joiner's-alley to the Water-side ; the Mob follow 'd , and cry 'd , Highwayman ! the Prisoner turn 'd about , and said , he was no Highwayman . He was knock 'd down with Stones , a Smith threw a hot Iron after him ; the Deceas 'd came off a Dung-hill , at the Corner of Dowgate , at the same time , and the Prisoner turn 'd about , and so off went the Pistol f , but whether it was fir 'd willingly or not I ca n't say . Court . Did the Prisoner say nothing before the Pistol went off . John Corderoy . He turn 'd about and said , he was no Highwayman , and bid them stand clear or he would Shoot . Court . And do you believe then that the Pistol went off by chance ? Prisoner . I fir 'd the Pistol , but did it in my own Defence . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 62. John Bennet , was indicted for stealing a living China Cock-Pheasant , value 13 s. 6 d. the Goods of Edward Gibbons , Esq ; Nov. 22 . Acquitted . 63. William Slate , was indicted for stealing 24lb . of Bees- wax , value 20 s. the Goods of Persons unknown , Nov. 27 . Acquitted . 64. Catherine Pember , otherwise Buck , was indicted for stealing a silver Watch and Chain , value 5 l. 5 s. two Shirts , three Stocks , and a Handkerchief , the Goods of George-Gallimore , Oct. 20 . George Gallimore . Coming from beyond Temple-Bar , at Night , I enquir 'd my Way to White-Friars-Stairs , a Man who had two Women with him , told me , I was past the Stairs , and must turn down such an Alley . I went as he directed , and he and the Women follow 'd , and ask 'd me to drink a Dram . I told them , I had no dram Money . He said I was welcome whether I had or no , for it should cost me nothing . He went into a House , he call 'd for two Quaterns , paid a Shilling , and left us . The Prisoner then came up to me , and said , What do you call for ? I told her I had no Money to spend . Sure , says she , you wo n't trouble the House for nothing ? With much Importunity I gave her 6 d. she laid her Hand on my Thigh , and pull 'd my Watch out . Prisoner . Did not you charge the other Woman for this ? Gallimore . The other Woman held me while the Prisoner got off , and therefore I charged the other Woman . I was beat and abus 'd there , 'till my Face run down with Blood , and at the same time I lost my other Goods , which were in a Bundle . The Constable came , and I and the other Woman ( Ann Castle ) were sent to Woodstreet-Compter . The Prisoner came to me there in another Dress , and desir 'd me to be easy ; I told her , perhaps I might , if I had my Goods again ; and in a little time they were all sent to me . Prisoner . He told me , in Woodstreet-Compter , he did not know the Woman that robb 'd him . Gallimore . Here 's the Porter that brought me my Goods again . Robert Murry , Porter . A Man call 'd to me , as I came out of my Master 's House , in Milk Street , and , says he , Go over to Mr. Gallimore , at the Bull-Head , and give him this Parcel . And who must pay me ? says I . Why , says he , the Gentleman will . I found Mr. Gallimore and the Constable there , and the Constable said , I 'll be hang 'd if here are not the Things ; they open 'd the Bundle , and there was a Watch and some Linen in it . I went from thence and saw the Man who sent me , going into the Compter - It seems , he 's one of the Runners there - I ask 'd him for my Money , but he deny 'd that he sent me , and he is run away since . Mr. Cathery , Constable . The Prisoner came to me next Morning ( after the Prosecutor lost his Goods ) and ask 'd me , what she had best to do ? I told her , the best way would be to send the Man his Goods again ; and in half an Hour they were sent accordingly . Prisoner . I never saw the Prosecutor , till I saw him pulling the other Woman about in Hanging-Sword-Alley . Thomas Smith . Anne Castle , and George Gallimore , were brought Prisoners to me in Wood-Street-Compter , and next Morning I saw the Prisoner in a green Gown and flower 'd Robings , talking with Gallimore , and he did not charge her . Richard Bromhall . I receiv 'd Castle and Gallimore into the Compter . The Prisoner 's Husband is confin 'd in our House , and the Prisoner coming to see him , ell into Company with Gallimore , and tho ' she talk 'd with he did not know her , but said , he was certain Castle was the Woman that robb 'd him . William Welch . I was in the Compter-lodge that Night , and some Body said to the Prosecutor , Do you know the Woman that robb 'd you ? I charge no Body here , says he , and I would not see the Woman that robb 'd me , for never so much ; tho ' , at the same time , she was in his Company , and drinking with him - He afterwards went into her Husband 's Room ; her Husband ask 'd him , if he knew the Woman ? and he answer 'd , Yes , I am sure I know her ; and then she stood with him while he spoke , and she was in the common Dress that she comes in every Day to the Compter to see her Husband - He and she were together all the Morning ; he said , he had met a naughty Woman that carry 'd him to a Brandy-house , where one held him , while another Woman pick 'd his Pocket , and that he should know her from a hundred . What sort of a Woman was she ? says the Prisoner . Why , says he , she was lustier than you , and pitted with the Small-pox , and was in a black Gown . Sarah Davis . The Prosecutor met me , and said , How do you do , Kate Buck ? I told him , I was not Kate Buck . If you are not , says he , I wish you would show me where she is , and I 'll give you half a Crown ; and so Kate Buck came out and I shew 'd her to him - This was the Night before the Prince came - and a Fortnight after the Robbery . Court . Is her Name Buck ? Prisoner . That was my Maiden-Name . Another . The Prisoner and Prosecutor were drinking together in the Compter , and he said to her , I wish I could see Kate Buck , but I would not have her to see me . It 's my Belief , says she , you do n't know her . Not know her ? says he . Yes , I know her from five hundred . Court . He might be afraid to own he knew her when he was in the Compter among so many of her Acquaintance . Prisoner . He did not challenge me 'till a Fortnight after the other Woman was committed upon his Charge , as she can prove . Court . Shall that Woman be call 'd ? She must answer your Questions if you desire it - But then she must answer mine too . Prisoner . I do n't want to call her . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . [ Transportation .

About a Year ago , Alice Dearing was indicted here , for uttering bad Money , and acquitted . On the 4th of this Month , she came , and told me , she knew two of the Prisoners , Mary Wright , and her Daughter , Elizabeth Wright , to be Coiners , and that she suspected the other Prisoner John Knight ( Mary Wright 's Son ) but could not be positive that he was concern 'd with them , and that as soon as she could find out their Lodgings , she would give me Notice . Accordingly last Tuesday , by her Directions , I took Mr. Burly and Mr. Froud with me , and went to an Alehouse in Little St. Martin's-Street , by Leicester-Fields ; we sent the Girl at the Alehouse to the Prisoner 's Lodgings , under pretence of enquiring for a Pot , to see if they were at home . The Girl brought us Word they were . I sent Burly and Froud up Stairs , placed another to watch at the Door , and went my self into the Yard , to see if any Moulds should be thrown out at Window . But believing they were taken by the Noise I heard above , I ran up . We ty 'd them , and then begun to search ; the first thing I took Notice of , was a bad Six-pence , some Chalk , and Brush lying in the Window , for we found no bad Money upon their Persons ; Looking towards the Fire-side , I saw a little Trunk . I ask 'd the Prisoner , Knight , What was in it ? He said , he could not tell . I drew the Nails and open 'd it , and found these pair of Chalk-Molds , which have the Impression of a Six-pence , the Head on one side , and the Reverse on the other : This Paper , in which were these Six-pences nfinish 'd , not so much as the Tops being cut off : This little Box with these 18 bad Shilings in : it This Bag , with about 40 bad Shillings , and Six-pences , 3 bad half Crowns , and some Pieces of Metal ; all these , and this Crucible , which is to melt Metal in , were found in this Trunk - Upon searching Knight farther , there was found in his Pocket this Key , which upon Trial open 'd this Trunk . Knight . That is the Key of the Trunk where my Linen is . Mr. North . After they were sent to Newgate , Richard Wright ( their Landlord ) told me he had found more bad Money under the Bed . I went again , and found this other Trunk , which the same Key opens . There were several bad Shillings in it , and some Nutmegs , and other odd Things , which I suppose they had bought when they changed their bad Money . Among the Cinders lay some mix 'd Metal and this Flask . William Burly confirm 'd Mr. North 's Evidence , excepting , as he said , he did not see the Key produc 'd , nor the Crucifix ( Crucible . ) Elizabeth Wright , the Landlady . I let my my Room a Month ago , to Elizabeth and Mary Wright , as for John Knight , he came backwards and forwards , but did not lodge there , except one Night , when his Mother had fell down and hurt her Face , and he came home with her - On Tuesday hearing a Noise , I went up , and found Mr. North , and others there ; he told me , they were Coiners - Christ forbid ! says I , and went out frightened . When they were gone , I found this Flask in the Cinders , and the Fellow to it , under the Bed , where was this Trunk too , with 4 l. bad Shillings and Six-pences in it . Mr. North . Here is another Box of bad Money , that I likewise found in the same Room . Elizabeth Wright . ( The Prisoner ) my Children are Innocent - I gave the Key of the Trunk to my Son . Court . He says 't is his own Key . The Jury found Elizabeth Wright Guilty of both Indictments , and acquitted Mary Wright and John Knight . Elizabeth Wright , and Mary Wright , were a third Time indicted for High-Treason , in Coining 20 Pieces of counterfeit Money , in the likeness of Shillings . Alice Dearing . I have known the Prisoners eight Years , but never was concern 'd with them till July last was 12 Month , when one Sunday , Elizabeth came to my Lodging , and ask 'd me to go out with her next Day , but said nothing upon what Account . I agreed , she came on Monday , between 2 and 3 in the Afternoon . We went out together . Crossing Lincoln's- inn -fields , she gave me 6 d. ( I thought it was a good one ) to buy some Gingerbread ; the Man said it was not . I told her of it ; she curs 'd me for a Fool ; gave me another to fetch a Pennyworth of Silk ; I pass 'd it , and brought her the Change . You Fool you , says she , you may do this as well as my Daughter Molly , if you 'll give your Mind to it , and you shall have half what you get . After this I put off several in the same Manner , and we always shar 'd whatever Goods I bought , and the Change out of the bad Money . They then lodg 'd at Mrs. Mason 's , a Chandler , against the Chequer Alehouse in King's-street , and there I saw Elizabeth cast Money in these Frames ; but how she fill 'd them , or what Metal she us 'd , I ca n't tell ; but she put a Tobacco-pipe with some Metal in it in the Grate , and when it was melted , pour 'd it in here , and opening the Frame , threw out a Shilling ; she turn 'd the Frame another Way , and made a Six-pence ; she put the Six-pence in my Hand , and it burnt me , and so I saw her make about 20 Shillings , and as many Six-pences . Her Daughter , Mary , at the same Time cut off the Tails with a Pair of Scissars , scrap 'd the Edges round with a Knife , and then fil 'd them . After this , the Mother went to Ireland , and left me and her Daughter Mary , and Ann Knight ( her Daughter by another Husband ; ) I was taken up for passing a bad Six-pence in Lombard-street , and this Day 12 Month I was brought to have a Detainer till next Sessions , Mr. North being ill , I was sent from hence to the Compter , and at next Sessions was try 'd and acquitted ; but I was ruin 'd by being 7 Weeks in Confinement : I was big with Child , and forc 'd to sell my Bed , and they all kept from me under this Misfortune , and would not so much as send me any Thing for my Relief . I said to my self , If ever I find 'em in the Kingdom , I 'll give the King an Account ; and 3 or 4 Months ago I was inform 'd they were come to London . The Mother sent for me , in the Name of a Gentleman , to come to Mr. Garvey 's , at the Bull-head in Prince's-street ; when I came to her , she said she was sorry to hear of my Trouble . About 5 Weeks ago I inform 'd Mr. Ashton of this , and about a Month ago I told Mr. North , and Mr. North assur 'd me there was no Reward to be given in such Cases . I made it my Business to enquire out their Lodging , and having found it , I sent Word to Mr. North last Tuesday , and he came and took them . Mr. North . On Alice Dearing 's Information I took the Prisoners ; and besides the Things I mentioned in the last Trial , I found this Pair of Scissors and these two Files in their Room . Eliz . Wright . I do n't know what to say for myself , but my Child is innocent ; spare her , and do as you please with me . The Jury found them both guilty . Death . The Trials being ended , the Court proceeded to give Judgment as follows : Received Sentence of Death 14. Henry Baxter Page 5. John Rook ibid . William Brown p. 26. Joseph Whitlock ibid .
