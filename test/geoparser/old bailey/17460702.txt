Q . ( to James Crey . ) Where was you robb 'd , and when ? Crey . The 22 d of May last ; my Father-in-Law desir 'd me to go to Bow Fair to seek after his Children about Eleven o'Clock at Night ; so we went to the Fair and saw nothing of them there ; but heard they were stray 'd upon the Common ; in coming from thence we went into a Booth upon the Common and ask 'd for the Children : On the Fields Side of the said Common , near Stepney , a Man pass 'd me and bid me good Night ; presently after another , and he bid me good Night also ; I bid him good Night , and he wish 'd me well home : It was Moonlight and I walk 'd 'till I got under the Shade of the Trees , when a Man came behind me and snatch 'd my Stick out of my Hand ; he put a Pistol to my Breast and bid me stand and deliver ; immediately another jump 'd from behind the Stile and clapp 'd his Pistol to my Breast also : They demanded my Money , threatning to blow my Brains one in Case of Refusal ; I told them I had none , and begg 'd they would not use me ill and I would give them what I had ; with that one of them put his Hand into my Fob and took out my Watch . Q . Do you remember which it was ? Crey . I ca n't tell , my Lord , but he had a Frock and a Regimental Waistcoat on . Q . What Watch was it ? Crey . A Pinchheck Metal Watch with a Gold Dial-Plate and a Cornelian Seal set in Gold to it ; they search 'd my Pockets and took out a Couple of Handkerchiefs , one Silk and the other Linnen ; they also took my Pocket-Book : One took out my Watch and another of them my Pocket-Book . Court . So they both of them were rifling of you ? Crey . Yes , my Lord . Q . Do you know them ? Crey . I ca n't say , my Lord , that I know them . I told them my Pocket-Book would be of no Service to them , and desir 'd they would return it : They took the Silver Buckles out of my Shoes and Knead , and then bid me go over the Stile ; they sent me towards Limehouse , which was a Mile out of the Way . There were three of them , but only two came up ; I saw the other robbing my Father-in-Law . Q . What is your Father-in-Law 's Name ? Crey . His Name is Bitch . Q . What Business is your Father-in-Law . Crey . A Perukemaker , Sir . Q . Did you go the Way they would have sent you ? Crey . No , my Father desir 'd I might go with him . Court . You say one bad on a Footman 's Frock and a Regimental Waistcoat ? Crey . Yes . Q . How were the other apparel 'd ? Crey . I could not see any thing of either of them for the Shade of the Trees ; only the Man that pass 'd me in the Moon-shine , he that stopp 'd me first , who had on a Footman 's Frock , & c. Q . Did you observe what kind of Pistols they were ? Crey . I took them to be Holster Pistols ; I could not distinctly see them as they had them in their Hands . I took the Men to be Troopers . Q . ( to Moses Birch . ) What do you know of this Matter ? Birch . My Son and I were coming from Bow ; in the first Field from the Common I heard the steps of a Man , but could not see him for the high Ridge of Trees that shaded the Moon : I call 'd out to the Man to know if he had seen any Children that had lost their Way ; I bid him good Night , he said the same to my Son : The Man that bid good Night turn 'd about and bid me deliver my Money ; he said , give me your Money just now or I will shoot you ; I said I had none nor none would I give them ; for I was in Confusion and Hurry about my Children . I saw two Men stop my Son and head all that was said ; my Son said to them , Gentlemen , do n't use me ill , I have nothing valuable about me but my Watch , Shoe-Buckles and Knee-Buckles . Q . How far was you from him ? Birch . About as far as the Leads . While two were robbing my Son the other was with me , thinking he could cope with me , being a little Man ; but I would not be robb 'd by him . Q. I forgot to ask your Son if he met with his Watch again . Birch . No , my Lord . Q . ( to William Barns . ) What do you know in relation to this Matter ? Barns . My Lord , I keep a Goldsmith 's Shop upon Ludgate-Hill ; there came a young Woman to me to weigh some Buckles . Q . When was that ? Barns . The 23d of May . Q . What were those Buckles ? Barns . They were two Pair of Shoe-Buckles and Knee-Buckles ; they were brought by a Servant , who said said she came from her Mistress in Fleet-Lane to know the Value of them ; I look 'd upon them and weigh 'd them , and as I had a Warning from the Goldsmiths Company to stop two Pair of Shoe-Buckles and a Pair of Knee-Buckles , and these Things answering the Description in the warning , I told the Maid I would go along with her ; I took the Warning in my Pocket , and call 'd upon one Mr. Johnson , a Constable , to go with me ; and desir 'd him not to go directly into the House , but stay a little ; so I went in and there were two or three Women and a Man there . Q . Where was this ? Barns . In Fleet-Lane . When I came into the House I enquir 'd who the Buckles belong 'd to ; the Woman of the House said they were a Man 's who had left them there ; I ask 'd when he would return , and she said she was not certain as to the Time of his Return : I desir 'd to know whether it would be a Week or a Fortnight , and enquir 'd who the Gentleman was that sat by her ; she said it was her Brother ; so with that I pull 'd this Warning out of my Pocket and read it ; as soon as ever I had done she got up and went into a Place backward and I follow 'd her ; a Soldier was sitting in a Chair there and I ask 'd him if they were his Buckles ; he said yes , and that he bought them in Covent-Garden . Q . Was the Man either of these ? Barns . Yes , Humphrys one of the Prisoners at the Bar . Court . Then those were the two Pair of Buckles , and the Knee-Buckles . Barns . Yes , my Lord , and he said he had bought them at Covent-Garden , and gave Half a Guinea for them . Q . What did he mean Half a Guinea for all the Buckles ? Barns . Yes , for all of them . Then I told the Constable he must carry him before my Lord Mayor , and we went there , but my Lord was not within ; then I ask 'd for the Beadle of Goldsmith's-Hall , to give Information to the Gentleman that gave this Warning out , & c. Q . ( to Crey ) Are these your Buckles , the Buckles that you were robb 'd of ? Crey . Yes , my Lord . Q . Have you any Mark upon these Buckles ? Crey . They are foreign Make ; there is no Mark upon them ; I had them made in Barbadoes . Q . ( to Johnson , the Constable ) What do you know of this Affair ? Johnson . Mr. Barns call 'd upon me on Friday the 23d of May ; I went with him to the House in Fleet-Lane ; I stood at the Door at first , that no Body might go out of the House ; after Mr. Barns had some Talk with the Woman , I went in ; the Woman , she seem 'd to be in some Confusion : I said good Woman , these Buckles have been stolen and if you do n't bring the Person that owns them we must charge you . With that she went backward , and beckon 'd with her Hand for Mr. Barns and I to follow her ; when we came backward , there sat Humphry 's , one of the Prisoners . Q . What Cloaths had he on ? Johnson . It seem 'd to be the Cloaths he has on now , tho ' I wo n't be sure , but I know his Face . Court . You say you follow 'd the Woman and there you found this Man . Johnson . Yes my Lord . I said there had been a Robbery committed and these Buckles answer 'd the Description of the Advertisement , and I said I was fearful he was the Thief . He said he had the Foul Disease upon him , that his Sister gave him Half a Guinea yesterday and he bought these Buckles with it ; I said if he could give me no better Account of it I should take him Prisoner before my Lord Mayor ; so I took him to the Compter as my Lord Mayor was not within ; the next Morning I went to him again and I ask 'd him about the Buckles , then he said he bought them on Friday , and before he said he bought them on Thursday . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Will you ask this Witness any Questions ? Prisoner . Do you know me Sir ? Johnson . Yes , very well . Q .

I passed this Gentleman ( Mr. Crey ) and I met this Gentleman , his Father ( Mr. Birch ) and I demanded his Money . Q . Where was your Company then ? Bray . Then two ( the Prisoners ) were with this Gentleman ( Mr. Crey ) When I demanded Mr. Birch 's Money he tristed a little with me ; with that I gave him a knock into the Ditch and took from him 18 d. and by that Time they had robb 'd this Gentleman ( Mr . Crey . ) John Jennings and John Humphrys took from him a Pinchbeck Watch and Buckles . Q . How do you know they took this Watch and Buckles ? Bray . One of the Tongs of the Buckles was broke which they took from Mr. Crey . Then , when they had robb 'd the Gentleman , they came to me , and ask 'd me whether I had look 'd upon his Shoe-buckles and Knee-Buckles , which I had not ; for after I had knock 'd this Gentleman down into the Ditch , he took out an Instrument , and said , I might have that if it would be of any Service ; I told him it would be of no Use of me , he might keep it and be d - d. Q . What Instrument was it ? Bray . I do n't know but it was an Instrument to draw Teeth with . Then John Humphrys went into the Ditch , and took his Shoe-Buckles , which were mark 'd G. B. and a Pair of Knee-buckles . Q . What then ? Bray . Then one of them went to go one Way , and the other another ; I said , I desire you may go together , which they did , towards Bow . Q . What became of this Watch and Buckles ? Bray . Please you , my Lord . I carried the Watch and the Buckles to one Mr. - in the Old-Baily . After I had carried them there , that Man , John Humphrys ( the Prisoner ) said , I believe you have cheated me , and I desire you may go and fetch the Buckles again ; and I told him , if he went to make away with them it should be the worse for him : So I fetch 'd them back again . Q . Did you give them to Humphrys ? Bray . Yes , my Lord . Q . Do you know what became of them afterterwards ? Bray . Please you , my Lord , he went some where to have them valued , and had them stopp 'd . Q . Do you know what became of him afterwards , where he frequented , or where he lodg 'd ? Bray . He lodg 'd at the same House that I lodg 'd in at that Time . Q . Where was that ? Bray . In Ice-Alley in Westminster . Q . Was you ever in Fleet-Lane ? Bray . Yes , my Lord : The first of my going there was with John Jennings and John Stephens , and some more unknown to me ; they had got some Streak Iron ; so they desir 'd of me to tell them where they could sell it . I goes into Black-Boy-Alley in Fleet-Lane , at the Black-Boy , and she bought it , and they shar 'd it among them . Q . Was this the House that Humphrys and you frequented in Fleet-Lane ? Bray . I have gone to the Black-Boy and drank there . Q . ( to Mr. Barns ) Mr. Barns , Was it the Black-Boy ? Barns . I ca n't tell the Sign ; they sell old Cloaths . Q .

He charges me with being present and assisting in this Robbery ; I never was in Company with him , but as I have met him in Fleet-Street , and drank a Mug of Beer with him , or the like . Q . ( to Mr. Birch ) Was you knock 'd down ? Birch . He hit me a Blow which made me draw back and support myself with the Bank . Q . Had you any Instruments about you ? Birch . That he might not think that I had a great deal of Money , I said , What can you have of a poor Barber ? Will you have this Instrument ? and he said , D - n you , no . * * Bray , the Accomplice , was kept out of the Court during the Time the other Witnesses were examin 'd ; and the Reason of this last Question being put to Birch now was , that he had not mention 'd the Circumstance in his former Evidence of his being knock 'd down , which Bray had aken Notice of . Q . ( to Mary Randal ) Who do you appear for ? Randal . For John Humphrys . Q . Are you his Sister ? Randal . Yes , please you , my Lord ; and I let him have Half a Guinea . Q . Where do you live ?

John Dodson was indicted for stealing a Bag of Cotton , the Property of John Grey , the 13th of June . Q . ( to Mr. John Grey ) What do you know in Relation to this Cotton ? Grey . I think it was the 13th of June . On the Friday I happen 'd to be out about some Business , and came home about Ten o'Clock . My Man , John Dodson , ( the Prisoner ) had packed up a Bag of Cotton , 30 or 40 Pounds Weight . I came home the Friday Evening ; I had been receiving some Money , and I sent him for Acceptance of a Note ; he brought me a Draught upon Alderman Hankey . The next Morning my Sister said , What Cotton was that John carried out to Iron Gate ? I said I sold no Cotton : I look 'd at him , and said , John , What is the Matter of this ? he said , Sir , Do n't be frighten 'd and uneasy , for you shall know the Truth of it . My Brother said , John , I am afraid you are a Rogue : Indeed , we were extremely frighten 'd at the Thing . He went out as if he was going to make Water , and took to his Heels , and away he went , and I heard no more of him ; both my Brother and I saw him go , but our Surprize was so great , we had not Power to seize him , or call after him ; he was a Man we had a very good Opinion of . With this I went to Iron Gate , to the Sign of the City of Bristol : I ask 'd the Gentlewoman of the House , who is a Woman of good Character and Fortune , about him ; she said he had Lodged in her House frequently . I ask 'd her if she knew of any Cotton ; she said he had brought something or another , and that he should say that Cotton was exceeding dear , and that little Parcel of Cotton was worth three or four Pounds . The next Thing I did , I sent to a Relation 's of his in Burr-Street , in St. Katherine 's , and while we were at this House together , talking of this Affair , the Prisoner came in : As soon as he came in , the Woman of the House shew 'd him up Stairs , and said , John , I hear a sad Character of you . When he came up , I said John , how is this Thing ? You have committed a Robbery here . At first , my Lord , he deny 'd it ; his Relation prevail 'd upon him , and I together , to confess the Fact : I said the Thing will be better for you , do n't be desperate , but confess the Truth . He told me , if I would have Mercy upon him , or something to that Purpose , he would tell me the whole Affair : He told me that he did bag up the Cotton in the Afternoon , and he had brought it to that very House , and that he would get me my Cotton again . He went out with his Relation and a Friend of mine , in order to bring it again . I said to his Relation , what must I do in a Thing of this Nature ? I do n't know how to act in it : Will you be Security that this Man will appear on Monday or Tuesday , in order to go before the Justice , or what is necessary ? and let me see him the Beginning of the Week : Indeed , the Relation said , 't is so tender a Thing , if you had ask 'd me to have been Security for a Thousand Pound , I should have gave it for him , but as these Things appear , I will have nothing to do with it . My Lord , I have known the Man many Years ; he has been a Man in Trade for himself , and worth a Thousand Pounds . In my Surprize I could not tell what to do with him : I took him over Tower-Hill , with a Design to carry him to my House , and desir 'd he would be very candid with me , and tell me the whole Thing ; he then said , I sold 24 lb . of your Cotton to Mr. Scarsbrook . Q . ( to Peter Scarsbrook . Did you buy any Cotton of the Prisoner at the Bar ? Scarsbrook . The Prisoner came to my House between Eight and Nine o'Clock on Friday Night ; he ask 'd me my Name , and said , do n't you buy Cotton ? I said , I did . I ask 'd him , who recommended him to me ? He said , my Sister , that lives near the May-Pole . I ask 'd , whether it was spun or unspun ? He said he would fetch it in five Minutes Time ; but he staid fifteen . He brought up the Cotton ; I said , what do you ask a Pound for it . I do n't know whether he ask 'd 18 or 20 Pence for it . I ask 'd him his Name ; he said John Dodson ; I live , said he , at the Seven Stars in Bishopgate-Street , at a Tobacco-Cutter 's . I ask 'd him where he had the Cotton from ; he told me he had it out of Gloucestershire from a Sister of his ; I told him I would give no more than 18 d. per Pound . It weigh 'd 23 Pound , and I gave him 34 s. 6 d. for it . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) Will you ask him any Question ? Prisoner . I was in Liquor when I did it . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation .

John Mills , not having the Fear of God before his Eyes , nor regarding the Laws and Statues of this Realm , nor the Pains and Penalties there in contain 'd , was indicted for shooting at Thomas Lewis , on the 22d of October , in the Year 1743 , with a certain Gun loaded with Gunpowder , with an Intent to kill and murder . Council . May it please your Lordship , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , I am Council against the unfortunate Prisoner at the Bar ; the Indictment is grounded on an Act of Parliament wherein there are several Clauses ; for Instance , if any Person shall unlawfully cut down or destroy Trees , set fire to any Barn , House , & c. or shall willfully shoot at any Person , in any dwelling House or other Place , he shall be guilty of Felony : The clause we go upon is for willfully shooting at a Person . It may be necessary to shew for what Reason the Prisoner went to the House of Mr. Lewis , the Prosecutor , who is a Wheelwright , and lives in East-Smithfield : The Defendant , Mills , has been deem 'd a notorious Cheat ; he made it his Business to go to Mr. Lewis under artful Pretences , and is now confin 'd for such an Offence , upon a like Account he lately stood in the Pillory . Mills knowing a Friend of Mr. Lewis 's , with whom he had some Dealings , went to his House , and seeing a large Parcel of Wood , says , some of this wood grew in my Ground , I have a great Quantity coming to Town . Mills ask 'd Lewis whether he was acquainted with Mr. Higgs , he said yes , and that he had had some Dealings with him ; says he , I have more Timber coming up , and talk 'd likewise of Sheep and Lambs coming up to Smithfield Market , though none were brought . This was to give him a Colour for Credit , and upon this he desir 'd Mr. Lewis to go with him to one Mr . Jewel , and told him he should be much oblig 'd to him to give a Note of Hand for 12 l. 12 s. 3 d. he expected to have receiv 'd this Money the Friday following ; but there were no such Persons as Mills or Nichols to be found : so , Gentlemen , upon this they made Enquiry , and after some time thought fit to go to this Place , Bassildon in Berkshire ; they went first to Mr. Higgs , where they got a particular Information of Mills ; however he had Intelligence that Lewis was coming to his House . This is mention 'd to shew that he willfully shot , and that he knew the Person , by Expressions or Words to this Effect : By G - d , Lewis , I 'll shoot you ; and he had no sooner spoke those words than he fir 'd a Musket at him ; but the Prosecutor hearing him say he would shoot him , fell down , so I suppose he miss 'd his Aim : On finding the Man get up again , and endeavouring to run away , to shew him Malice , he said , G - d d - n him he is not dead , bring the Blunderbuss that I may blow his Brain , out ; but it happily fell out that he escap 'd . It may seem extraordinary that this Thing should end dormant so long ; but Mills was backward and forward , and could not be apprehended sooner , so that the Prosecution could not be brought on before . Q . ( to Thomas Lewis . ) When was this ? Lewis . The 9th of October , in 1743 , the Prisoner came into our Yard , and said these are brave Felleys , I have a great Quantity of them . Mr. Nicholls was very handsomly dress 'd , had a Silver Pair of Spurs , & c. Says Mills , Master Lewis , do you know Mr. Higgs , I was recommended by him to you ? They also wanted Lodgings , and I should have been glad to have lain out of my own Bed for them ( with a View of buying a good Bargain ; ) but my wife was not willing ; so I got them a Lodging elsewhere . Please you , my Lord , Mills and Nichollas had some Money of me ; after this I went down to see if the Barges were come up ; and when I came to speak to Mr. Higgs , I ask 'd him how he could defraud me in the Manner he had done , and began to tell him the Story ? He swore about Mills , and said , what has he been dealing in London again ? When we went down to Bassildon he went with us to this Mill 's House , which is near a Common ; when I got to the Door Mills saw me , and said d - n you I 'll shoot you , and levell 'd a Piece at me . Q . What Distance was you from him when he said he would shoot you ? Lewis . It might be about twenty Yards . Q . What did he say after that ? Lewis . He call 'd for the Blunderbuss , and said he would blow my Brains out . Q . Do you think it was loaded with any thing ? Lewis . I ca n't say whether it was loaded with Ball or Shot , it whistled by me . Q . Did you apply to any Justice of Peace against this Man ? Lewis . Yes . Q . What Justice did you apply to ? Lewis . I ca n't tell the Justice 's Name . Q . Where does he live ? Lewis . At Straitly . I shew 'd him the forged Note . Q . Did he take your Information ? Did you complain of his Shooting ? Did you desire the Justice to grant you a Warrant against the Prisoner ? Lewis . The Justice did not care to do any Thing with him , he is such a bad Man . Q . Did you make Complaints to the Justice of this Matter , and desire a Warrant ? Lewis . I shew 'd him how he trick 'd me . He he said they were very vile Fellows , and that they were not safe in lying in their Beds . Q . Did you request a Warrant from the Justice , and desire him to take your Information ? Lewis . I went to the Justice at Straitly for Advice . Court . That was for the Cheat , and not for shooting at you ; did you tell him in what Manner you had been shot at ? Lewis . Yes , my Lord . Q . How came you to exhibit this Indictment against him now ? Lewis . My Lord , for shooting at me , when I went down to endeavour to get my Money . Q . Did you ever endeavour to find him out ? Lewis . Yes . But I never could find him before . Q . Did you endeavour to take him up for the Cheat , or shooting ? Lewis . For the Shooting , please you my Lord . And when we came away he said , Ah ye London Fools , & c .. Q . ( to Thomas Brigs ) Did you go down to Bassildon with Mr. Lewis ? Briggs . Yes . Q . What Time in the Evening was it that you went to the Defendant 's House ? Briggs . We were at Bassildon about Four o'Clock in the Afternoon ; we sent for William Higgs , the Timber-Merchant , who was at work with his Men , and came from them between Five and Six o'Clock . We went up Bassildon-Heath to Mill 's house . Q . When you went there , tell us what you saw Mills do to Mr. Lewis ? Briggs . When we went to his House he stripp 'd himself into his Shirt , and took a Piece , a Gun , or Musket , and he swore by G - d , Mr. Lewis , if you do n't go away I 'll shoot you ; he levell 'd at Mr. Lewis ; as soon as I saw it I run behind the Barn , or Straw-Cock , or something . Q . What did he say ? Briggs . He swore he would shoot , and fir 'd off the Piece immediately . Q . How near was you to Mr. Lewis ? Briggs . As near as I am now . As soon as I saw the Piece I ran behind the Hovel , or stable . On Monday Morning when we came to set out , they said we were in Danger in going Home ; and we got a Per or two to go with us for fear of meeting with him upon the Road . Q . What Time do you take it to be that you was at Mill 's House ? Briggs . It was about Seven o'Clock . As fine a Moon-shine Evening as ever I saw . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) Will you ask this Witness any Questions ? Prisoner . Mr. Lewis stood with a Penknife drawn , and swore he would stabb me . Q . ( to Lewis ) Had you at that Time a Penknife in your Hand ; did you threaten to do any Thing ? Lewis . No , my Lord . Q . If you could have got your Money would you have prosecuted the Prisoner ? Lewis . Yes , my Lord . Q . ( to George Rishton ) Pray how long is it since you had any Dealings with the Prisoner at the Bar ? Rishton . Nichols and Mills came to me three Years ago . Q . Have you endeavour 'd to find him ? Rishton . I went down to Reading-Jail and found Nicholls . Q . Did you send to enquire after Mills ? Rishton . Yes , I sent one out of Berkshire to enquire after him . [ William Nicholls , who is now a Prisoner in Newgate , was call 'd upon as a Witness for his Acquaintance , Mills . ] Q . ( to Nicholls ) What have you to say in the Behalf of John Mills ; was you with Mills when Lewis came there ? Nicholls . I know Mr. Lewis very well . I was not in the House when Lewis came there . Q . Then you know nothing of the shooting off the Gun . Nicholls . Nothing , but what I heard Mr. Mills 's Man say ; one William Higgs , the Carpenter , came up with them , and my little Boy was there . [ As the Prosecution was so long after the Fact was committed , the Prisoner was acquitted of the Indictment . ] 218.

John Smith , of the Parish of St. Anne 's , was indicted , for that he , on the 14th of June last , did feloniously take and carry away one Promissory Note , No . 384 , subscrib 'd with the Name of Ralph Morrison , Value 20 l. the Property of William Twiss . Council . Please your Lordship , and Gentlemen of the Jury , I am Council on the Side of the Prosecutor ; the Prisoner stands indicted for feloniously taking and carrying away a Promissory Note , No . 384 , payable to Mr. Thomas Floyd , the Property of William Twiss . My Lord , the Case is , in short , this : Upon the 14th of June last , one Mr. Griffith sent a Bank Note to Mr. Twiss , to be exchang 'd for Silver ; Mr. Smith , the Defendant , receiv 'd it ; I believe every Body knows there has been a considerable Loss of Bank Notes ; Mrs. Twiss being afraid she should be impos 'd upon , compar 'd it with the Notes in the Advertisement , and therefore was willing to change it . The Prisoner was sitting in a little Room of the Publick House , and desir 'd Mrs. Twiss to let him have a Look at it , which she did , and he return 'd it again . As she was going away with it , he ( the Prisoner ) desir 'd she would favour him with another Sight of it ; being in a Hurry Mrs. Twiss leaves the Note in the Prisoner 's Hands . The Prisoner had with him a little Girl , about eight or nine Years of Age ; and while Mrs. Twiss was counting up the Change , he took the Opportunity to go away with the Note , Mrs. Twiss 's Back being towards him ; but missing the Prisoner , she told her Husband of it , upon which this Man was immediately pursu 'd ; they follow 'd him to his Lodgings , at one Mrs. Jones 's ; when they came there he was at the Vault ; for some Time he offer 'd to go before a Justice of Peace , or deposit the Value in Mrs Twiss 's Hand : There was one there passes for his Wife ; she desir 'd there might be no Noise about the Note , for it should be produced : She said , Nay , it may be among the Child 's Playthings , for she is exceeding fond of Paper . There was one Mr. Clark and Laurence call 'd to their Assistance , as a sort of Guard ; yet he run out of the House , and went into Hare-Street , Piccadilly ; there he stay 'd for some Time : From thence he made his Escape , got out at the Back-Door , into a Gentleman 's Airy , where he was taken and carry 'd to the Watch-house . The Bank Note was not found upon him , nor had he any Money about him at that Time . The next Night Mrs. Jones , his Landlady gave the Note to Mr. Twiss . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury , I have open 'd the Case , and will call my Witnesses in order to prove it . I shall not attempt to do any thing by way of Exaggeration against the Prisoner ; but if we prove him guilty we hope you will find him so . Council for the Prisoner . May it please your Lordship , and Gentlemen of the Jury , I submit it whether , according to his own Opening , 't is not a Breach of Trust . Q . ( to Mrs. Twiss ) Where do you live ? Twiss . At the Horse and Dolphin by St. Anne 's , Soho . Q . Have you ever seen the Prisoner at the Bar before ? Twiss . I never did , 'till the Time he took the Bank Note . Q . When was it ? Twiss . Upon a Saturday , the 14th Day of June ; I had an Acquaintance along with me in my Bar-Room . This Prisoner came into the House , introduced himself into the Bar-Room , and was very free with my Acquaintance , Mrs. Catherine Wood . I was backward when the Prisoner came into the House . There was a little Girl he brought along with him ; Mrs. Wood said , Do you know this Man ? I said I knew the Girl ; she came three or four Times a Day to the House ; she lodg 'd at a Neighbour 's . And as he sat there , by and by , Mr. Griffith , a Master Taylor in Gerrard Street , sent a Bank Note ( by Giles Webb , his Apprentice ) and desir 'd I would give him Change for it to pay his Men . The Advertiser lay upon the Table in the little Room ; I stepp 'd into the little Room , and said , I will look if this Note is not one of those advertis 'd . When I had look 'd at it , the Prisoner said , Pray let me compare the Note and the Paper together ; which I did , my Lord , and stood by to receive it back again : He return 'd it to me again , and in a Moment after he had done it , he said , Pray indulge me a second Time , and let me compare the the Names . The Boy stood by me , my Lord , that wanted the Change , and said , My Master is in Haste for Change ; so I went to the Box , directly facing the Room ; the Boy sat facing the Door , and I had my Back to it : The Gentlewoman that was in the Room came out , and , as she past , clapp 'd me on the Shoulder , and said , Take Care of your Note . My Husband was then come into the Room , and was backwards and forwards , and ask 'd me how much Change Mr. Griffith wanted ; I said , Twenty Pounds ; he said , I know that , but did he want Gold or Silver ; but the Boy that I gave the Change to saw the Man go out . When I had done I went to the Bar , and said to my Husband , Have you got the Note ? he said , No ; then said I , Run after the Man that lodges at Jones 's , for he has got it . Q . And how long was this after you gave him the Note the second Time ? Twiss . When I had given him the Change , which was only nine Pounds in Silver , and the rest in Gold , and when I went to the Bar it was gone ; it might be three or four Minutes . Q . Do you know any Thing further ? Twiss . No more than that I went to his Lodgings , to Mrs. Jones ; when we came , they said he was at the Vault ; he went through the Passage into the Vault ; so I said to my Husband , Pray fetch him out , he will make away with the Note : When he came out he said , What is it you want ? I said , I come for the Note ; he said he had return 'd it ; I said , that he did the first Time , but not the second . The Woman said she would examine the Girl , for she was exceeding fond of Papers ; she said , may be she had it among her Playthings . Q . Who was this Woman ? Twiss . The Woman he lives with , one Mrs. Chaff , sometimes goes for his Wife ; they began to quarrel before us ; he said , this is what you have brought me to , & c. for she said , if it was not found she would answer for it . He said we had no proper Officers , and could not detain him ; then . Thomas Laurence desir 'd us to send for somebody else , which we did , we sent for Mr. Clark ; when he came he call 'd for a Light , but we could have none , and the Prisoner made his Escape into Jones 's Shop , and hid himself there ; but Laurence and Clark serch 'd him out : Then , Sir , immediately after that he burst open the Door , and got out into the Street . Q . ( to Catherine Wood ) Do you remember being at Mr. Twiss 's ? Wood . Yes , it was the 14th of June , being Saturday . Q . Did you see the Prisoner come into the House ? Wood . I was in the Room when the Prisoner came in and sat down , and I thought I had as much Right to sit there as he , and I kept my Place . I was there when this Note came to be exchang 'd . Mrs. Twiss took up the Paper and brought the Note in her Hand ; the Prisoner desir 'd to see the Note , and she gave it him into his Hand , and he gave it her again : As she turn 'd her Back he desir 'd he might be indulg 'd with the Sight of it once more ; which she did , and gave it him again . Q . Did he return it again ? Wood . He did not . I got up and went away ; as I went into the publick Room I desir 'd Mrs. Twiss to take care of her Note . Q. Pray , how came you to bid her take care of her Note ? Wood . I ca n't say I lik 'd the Person . Q . So he was perusing the Note when you went away ? Wood . Yes , My Lo rd . Q . Did you know the Prisoner at the Bar before ? Wood . No . Council . Then you had no Reason to have a Suspicion of him ? Wood . When he receiv 'd it the second Time he held it up to the Window , and said it was possible to cancel it ; that he thought it possible to put out Thomas Floyd , and put in Edward , which was advertis 'd . Richard Hall . On Saturday the 14th of June I call 'd to see Mrs. Twiss , being old Acquaintance . I went into the Publick Room ; she said there was an Acquaintance of mine , Mrs. Wood ; she shew 'd me into the little Room behind the Bar . While I was there , there came a Bank Note to be exchang 'd . There lay the News Paper on the Table before the Prisoner . Q . Did any of you know him ? Hall . I never saw him in my Life before . When the Note came , said Mrs. Twiss , I will look and see if 't is one of those that are advertis 'd . The Prisoner being very officious , he was desirous to see it : The Person for the Change being in Ha , she desir 'd it of him again ; he return 'd it , but he desir 'd just to be indulged with another Look again . He held the News Paper in one Hand , and the Note in the other ; I ca n't say how long at that Time . Mrs. Wood went away , but I remain 'd in the Room . I was the last , I did not see him deliver the Note again to Mrs. Twiss . Q . Where was Mrs. Twiss ? Hall . Mrs. Twiss was in the Publick Room giving the Change . Q . Then there was No-body in the Bar-Room but you and the Prisoner ? Hall . No ; there was a little Child came in and out . Q . What happen 'd after that Time ? Was he perusing it ? Hall . The Prisoner soon went away : I was the last in the Room , and he must take it away , for there was nothing left in the Room . Q . How long might be the Time that you was in the Room after he went off . Hall . I went away directly after him . Q . Where was Mrs. Twiss ? Hall . Mrs. Twiss was in the publick Drinking Room , and had not finish 'd giving the Change . Q . Did you follow him ? Hall . I stay 'd in the Room ; it might be two Minutes after him . Q . Do you know whether the Child was in the Room when he was comparing this Note ? Was she there the second Time ? Do you know , in the first Place , whether the Child was , or was not , in the Room ? Hall . I ca n't be positive of that . Court . But the last Time you saw the Note it was in his Hand ? Hall . In his Hand , my Lord , and it might be two or three Minutes , or thereabouts , before he went away . Q . ( to Giles Webb ) Do you remember carrying any Bank Note to Mrs. Twiss ? Webb . On Saturday Night , the 14th of June , I carried a Bank Note to Mrs. Twiss , to give me Change : She was in the Bar Room , and the Prisoner at the same Time ; she took the News Paper , and look 'd at it . I turn 'd into the common Room , and left her and the Prisoner there : A little after I came to her again , and told her I was in Haste , and she left the Prisoner in the Room and Bank Note , and came to a little Box in the Bar-Room to give me Change ; the mean while I saw the Prisoner go out . Q . Had he the Child with him when he came out ? Webb . I did not see the Child go out with him : The Child did come to Mrs. Twiss while she was telling the Money , so we desir 'd her to go away because we could not tell the Money ; she was fingering of it . Q . ( to John Clark ) Will you give my Lord and the Jury an Account of what you know of it ? Clark . On Saturday the 14th of June I was sent for by Mr. Twiss in a great Hurry , for what , I did not know 'till I came into the House ; said he , I beg you will go to Mrs. Jones 's , and assist my Wife in taking a Man that has robb 'd me of a Bank Note . When I went to Jones 's , they were all in Darkness ; I asked for a Light , but it was refus 'd me by the Landlady Mrs. Jones ; she refus 'd me several Times . There was a Woman that has gone for the Prisoner 's Wife ; she came , and , in a soothing Way , said , Mr. Clark , I beg to speak to you : I said , Madam , I doubt there is no Good if you are concern 'd in it ; she desir 'd me to be quiet ; she said , if the Note was lost , she would lay down an equal Sum 'till it was found . Q . Was that in the Presence of the Prisoner ? Clark . The Prisoner was in the Room , but I had not seen him ; by and by he made his Escape backward . I had some Suspicion when I heard she was concern 'd in it , that it was him ; so he made his Escape into the Work Shop , which was very dark . I went into the Work Shop , and grovel 'd about for him ; I believe I was in the Shop the best Part of ten Minutes : At last I found something stir 'd , for he had Opportunity of seeing me ; he rises up , and I pinion 'd him after this Manner , and carried him so into the House ; he said I had no Authority to detain him , and used me with a great deal of Insolence . I was conscious I was got into very bad Hands ; I sent for Mr. Twiss , but he did not come so readily as I could wish . Then he made a Push into the Street , and swore he would do us a Mischief , me in particular , if I dar 'd to presume to follow him . When we came to the first Corner , he made a Push to get away ; we followed him into Hare-Street , Piccadilly , there he went into the House of one Miller ; I left Laurence to watch him ; there he was a considerable while . Mr. Twiss went to St. Anne 's Watch-house , and I went to St. James 's Watch-house ; these are the People here that took him . Thomas Laurence . On Saturday the 14th of June last , when I came to Mr. Twiss 's Door , he told me he had lost a Bank Note ; I went to the House , the Gentlewoman that past for the Prisoner 's Wife , she pretended the little Girl had got the Note , that she was very forward for Paper , Pictures , & c. and in speaking of it , she pretended the Child knew that she had lost the Note . Q . Did you take him ? Laurence . Yes , my Lord ; he got over two Walls from Mr. Miller 's House ; he got into one Mr. Dowdel 's Airy , and we took him there , and had him to the Round-house . John Fenton . When we came to Mr. Miller 's Door in Hare-Street , the Woman of the House said he was gone backward ; so we took him in Mr. Dowdel 's Airy . Dowdel . I was in Bed , my Lord , about Twelve o'Clock , and my Servant up two Pairs of Stairs heard a Man in my Garden , that there was a strange Man had made his Escape to the back Part of my House . I got up as soon as I could put on my Night-Gown , and that Gentleman ( Mr. Fenton ) and Mr. Laurence had got Hold of him in my Area . I went to the Watch-house with him , and I appear 'd before Sir Thomas to support the Charge . Mrs. Twiss made Use of my Name coming to her Husband , in Relation to this Bank Note . This Woman they call Mrs. Chass , came to my House the next Day , to let me know that she believed the Note was found ; upon which I said I am glad of it , that they might not lose their Money . Upon her assuring me this , I went to Mrs. Twiss , and enquired for her Husband ; she told me her Husband was at Westminster ; I told her I desired that he would not advertise the Bank Note , but come to me the next Day . The next Day Mrs. Jones came to me , and said she had the Note , and said also she was frightened out of her Wits about it , and she wanted to part with it ; well , said I , you must carry it to the Person that owns it . Q . ( to Mrs. Twiss ) Who advertised the Note ? Twiss . My Husband advertised it , and I am sure , my Lord , this is the Note . Q . Well , Madam , will you give an Account how you came by the Note again ? Twiss . Mr. Dowdell inform 'd me that Mrs. Jones had the Note , and I might have it ; so I went to Col. De Veil to know whether I should take the Note again ; he was for my taking of it , but to take somebody with me to attest it ; so I had the Note of Mrs. Jones . Q . What did she say to you ? Twiss . She did not say hardly any Thing to me when she gave it . Q . ( to Ralph Morrison ) Look at the Bank Note , and tell us who 't is sign 'd by . Morrison . I am a Cashire of the Bank , and it is of my signing , Sir . Council for the Prisoner . I must beg Leave to offer , whether this Thing do n't appear plainly to be a Breach of Trust ? Q . ( to the Prisoner ) What have you to say by Way of Defence ? Prisoner . My Lord , I must beg I have of the Court to Lodgings a few Questions . Court . You must tell us how you came by the Note . Prisoner . I went in with a Child , my Lord , into this House ; she says in the Room she was in , she has only select Company : I was never in the House before ; the Door was open , it seem 'd to me to be an open Publick Room . My Lord Scarborough 's Servant was there , and talking something of the late Lord Scarborough , and indifferent Matters , this Mrs. Twiss comes out of the Bar ; there was a Step or two to come down to this Place : She brings a Bank Note in her Hand , and said I am going to change it ; she wanted to know if it was Loyd , or Floyd , in the Advertisement , but it was not the same Christian Name . Then said she 't is a good Note ; I thought my Lord she meant whether it was a real Bank Note . Pray indulge me with it , I said ; then I told her she was very safe in changing of it : I return 'd it again , my Lord , and I knew no more of it afterwards ; she says she took up the Advertiser . When I had the Advertisement in my Hand , and a little Child playing at my Knee , she comes to me to know whether that Note was advertis 'd ; she mentions that it was but two Minutes that I staid after she left me and went to change the Notes ; pray ask her how many Minutes she was upon her Examination ; that 's nearer than 14 Days ago ; she does not know what a Minute is : I was there three Quarters of an Hour after . Did I not speak to my Lord Scarborough 's Servant , if he came there again of an Evening , I would drink with him ? I treated him , did not let him pay any Thing , and that pretty Lady too I treated . Now , my Lord , if I was not last in the Room , which I take to be the Publick Tap , if I was not the last in the Room , he must be the last ; then I could not have spoke to him upon the Bench going out . Give me Leave to trouble you with the next . The first Evidence , Mrs. Twiss , speaks of the Gentlewoman where I lodge , whereas she knows no more where I lodge than your Lordship ; where she says I lodge , I have the Woman here present to know , whether I ever lay in the House where this unhappy Accident happen 'd . Now , my Lord , she swears so absolutely that I took it away , but it was before Sir Thomas , who has a very beautiful Way of Empire in his own Territories . Did she not send to the Taylor , the Owner and Proprietor of this Note , to know whether the Boy had taken this Note along with him and the Money ; that I hope your Lordship will ask . Now as to this wooden this Mrs. W my Lord . I made an As with that she to with the following Week : See whether she will deny that ; I hope she is not up to de this honourable Court ; I have they are own Cloaths . My Lord , she had an ill Opinion of me ; how can so fine a Lady have an ill Opinion of that charming fine Fellow , told me I was at that Time . This Bar , my Lord , is like the Pulpir of a Church adjoining to the Wall ; how then could I go behind the Room ? 'T is a publick Room , my Lord . Mrs. Wood likewise says , my Lord , that Mrs. Twiss came in and took up the Advertiser , when I had it in my Hand all the Time . Now , my Lord , here is a Boy that says he saw me : I was remote from his immediate seeing of me , because there was a Partition to prevent it , and I sat with my Elbow on the Table , with the Advertiser in my Hand : That Boy pretends he saw me ; I believe he never saw me , for he had been gone Three Quarters of an Hour before I left the Place . Here is another Man , one Clark ; he says , when he came to this Mrs. Jones 's House , it was very dark ; when it was not ; but it was too dark for me , my Lord . Q . ( to Mrs . Twiss . ) Is this the Room that you let particular Company into ? Twiss . Yes , particular Acquaintance ; the Girl being with him was the Reason of his being admitted . Q . ( to Margaret Jones . ) Does the Prisoner lodge with you ? Jones . No , nor never did . Q . Does he not lodge in your House ? Does he not frequent your House ? Jones . Yes , but his general Return is about Ten o'Clock at Night . Q . Are you the Person that the Bank Note was deliver 'd to ? Jones . I was the Person that help 'd to search their Appartment for it ; I took the Box where the Note was , from the Prisoner 's Child . Q . You made a Search for it ; where did you find it ? Jones . I took it out of the Prisoner 's Daughter 's Hand . Q . When was it the Child gave you the Note ? Q . Was this Note in a Box ? Jones . I saw it stamp 'd with the Bank Mark . Q . Where was this Box ? Jones . I had the Box out of the Child 's Hand : Before this , we had threaten 'd to take her before Justice De Veil . Q . Who us 'd this Back Parlour ? Jones . On Mrs. Chaff ; I left it to her . Court . And in that Appartment the Box was : What Size Box was it ? Jones . A little Snuff-Box . [ The Box was produced in Court . ] Q . Did she tell you when this was ? When was this ? Jones . The Monday following . Q . Did you ever see the Child with this Box before ? Jones . Not before the Note was lost . Court . You say you saw the Box that the Child had , with the Note in it . Jones . Yes . Q . How could you discern it was a Bank Note in this little Box ? Jones . I knew it by the Fineness of the Paper . Q . Did the Child sold it up , and lay it in the Box so smooth ? Jones . I ca n't tell . Q . Who did you deliver the Note to ? Jones . Sir , I went to ask Advice , then deliver 'd it to Mr. Twiss . Q . Who was in the Room with the Child when you took the Bank Note ? Jones . There was Mrs. Chaff , another Gentlewoman , and the Child . Council for the Prosecutor . Mrs. Jones , pray explain an Expression you had of Searching their Appartments : Did you examine the Child before the Prisoner was accused of the Note ? Jones . When the Child was with some other Children she was crying for a Note that she had lost . Council . Then all the Time the Confusion was , the Child was looking for a Bank Note of 20 l. Did you not hear the Prisoner charg 'd with it ? Did he think the Child had got it ? Did you hear the Child was suspected ? Was the Child examin 'd then ? I think the Box this Note was in , was smaller than what is produced . Pray how did the Note lay in the Box ? Jones . It was folded up in the Box . Council . As soon as you saw it folded up , you knew it was a Bank Note : Pray how came you to take Notice of a Bit of Paper in a Box first ? Jones . There was good Reason when the Note was search 'd for . Q . ( to Anne Pagget . ) Was you present when this Note was found ? Pagget . The Child said she threw it behind the Red , in a little black Box ; the last Witness went and search 'd behind the Red , with Mrs. Smith , and they found it behind the Red , that is all that I know of it . Q . ( to Mary Philpot . ) What is the Prisoner 's general Character ? Philpot . He has lodg 'd with me ; he never was out of his Lodging after Ten o'Clock ; his Character is very good , I never heard any ill of him . Q . How does he get his Livelyhood ? Philpot . He told me he was come to Town for his Preferment . Prisoner . I have no less than the Promise of Mr. Jefferys , one of the Secretaries of the Treasury , for a Place in the Stamp-Office . Q . ( to Philpot . ) Has he now any Business ? Philpot . My Lord , he is waiting for a Place . Q . ( to Joseph Spendelow . ) How long have you known the Prisoner , and what is his general Character ? Spendelow . I never enquir 'd that , my Lord ; he employ 'd me , and always paid me honestly . Q . ( to George Wrench . ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Wrench . I have known him these three Years , and I never heard any thing bad of him . Q . ( to - Powell . ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Powell . Three or four Years ; I was once employ 'd by him as an Attorney , and he paid me , & c. Prisoner . My Lord , as to finding the Note , I hope you will indulge me : This Child , and another , were in the Coach-Yard . At the Time of my Accusation , my little Child was searching about the Dunghill , and looking for the Bank Note she had lost with a Picture upon it . Council for the Prisoner . My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury ; I would submit it , whether a Person without any Colour of Frand or Pretence , but with the Will of the Party , can be said to have stolen the Note , or have taken it by Robbery ; wherever a Person has once a legal Possession , it could not be consider 'd as a Felony , as in the Case of Watte . It was answer 'd , the Waite 's Case was different from this ; that was the Case of East-India Bonds , and he was entrusted by the Company ; he had the Custody of the Bonds , and upon the Evidence it did appear , that he embezzled these Bonds in his Custody ; and the Opinion of the Court in that Case was , that it was a Felony ; and there is a Law made since that to make it a Felony . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 271. John Crips was indicted for stealing 20 Lambs , the Property of Mary Dell , Widow , William Dell and John Dell , from their Grounds at Welpley-Hill , in the County of Bucks , the 12th of June . Q . ( to William Dell . ) What is it you know of this Matter ? Dell . I lost 20 Lambs , Sir , the 12th Day of June last . Q . Where were they ? Dell . They were at Welpley-Hill , in the Parish of Chesham , in Bucks . Q . What , you live there , do you ? Dell . Yes , Sir . Q . Whose Lambs were they ? Dell . Mine and my Brothers . Q . Which of those Lambs belong to you ; how many belong 'd to you ? Dell . About five of them belong 'd to me , more or less . Court . All 20 belong 'd to your Brother and you ; pray which of them were the Widow 's ? Dell . She is my Mother , and we go on together . Court . Now give an Account in relation to these Lambs . Dell . We lost them out of the Grounds the 12th of June last ; I came up to Smithfield at Ten the next Morning , thinking they might be brought there ; but I found them on the Road in Henden Parish , about the Five-Mile Stone . Q . Was the Prisoner with them ? Dell . No , Sir . Q . How do you know the Prisoner was concern 'd in taking them ? Dell . I do n't know any otherwise than I have been told . Q . ( to John Bowden . ) What is it you say to this Affair ? Bowden . My Lord , as my Man was on the Road with a Drove of my Lambs , I overtook him and the Prisoner at the Bar . Q . Had the Prisoner any Lambs ? Bowden . No , my Lord , none that I saw ; he had a Scythe upon his Shoulder and a Bundle in his Hand . Q . Where was it that you overtook this Man and the Prisoner ? Bowden . Just beyond the Seventeen-Mile Stone at Watford . Q . What Day was this ? Bowden . On a Wednesday , the 11th of June . Q . What more ha ve you to say ? Bowden . When I came up , my Man said , now you may talk with my Master about your Lambs yourself ; so Crips , pull 'd off his Hat to me , and said , How do you do Master Bowden ? I said , I do not know you ; said he , I understand you sell Lambs at London ; I wish I had known it , I would have brought a Lot of Lambs for you to have sold for me . He told me he liv 'd at Aston-Cliston ; I said that was a pretty Way ; but he said my Lambs are not kept at Aston-Clifton , they are at Chosberg ; that Keeping was short and the Butcher could take but few at a Time , and he wanted to sell them all together . He said , I have a good Mind to leave my Scythe and Bundle at your House ; I am a pretty good Walker , and if I can get away at Two or Three o'Clock I can bring them ; and away he went , so I never saw any more of him . I went to Hempstead Market on Thursday . I ask 'd my Wife whether she had seen the Man with the Lambs ; I said , I wish it is not a bad Thing . On Friday Morning I was at Smithfield ; about Ten o'Clock Mr. Dell came to me ; he said to me , do n't your Man Peter drive for you now ? I said yes ; he ask 'd if any Body else drove Lambs for me ; I said , there is a Man come through Edgworth Turnpike , and had no Money ; but said he was bringing twenty Lambs to sell at Smithfield Market for me . I said to Mr. Dell , be so good as to go into the Alehouse and I 'll take Care of him ; but he never brought the Lambs at all : I said , we will go back to see if we ca n't find these Lambs . We came to - Bridge ; the Man said he saw a Fellow pelting them along with Stones , about Six o'Clock , very dirty and much tir 'd . I told Mr. Dell we would ride up towards Hendon , where we heard nothing of them ; but found them at last in the Road in Hendon Parish : When me met with them no Body was with them ; but discovering they were his Lambs we drove them home . Q . ( to Richard Sparks . ) What is it that you know of this Affair ? Sparks . I was Collector at Edgworth Turnpike Gate ; the 13th Day of the Month a Man came with a Score of Lambs to the Gate , and I demanded the Toll ; but he said he had no Money ; I told him that was no Excuse , and ask 'd him who the Lambs belong 'd to ; he said Mr. Bowden , and he would pay me ; I said it was very well . Q . What were the Marks of those Lambs ? Sparks . They were so dirty I could not see : I charg 'd Mr. Bowden a Groat for them . Q . Are you sure the Prisoner drove them ? Sparks . Yes , I can swear the Prisoner drove them through the Gate . Q . Did you see the Lambs at Mr. Dell 's ? Sparks . I saw them the next Day , and believe they were the very same ; they were the same that Mr. Dell drove through the next Day . Q . ( to William Durrant . ) What do you know of this Affair ? Durrant . Please you , my Lord , I was the Man that took him . Q . When did you take him ? Durrant . Last Monday se'nnight , the 23d of June . Q . Where did you take him ? Durrant . At Stanmore , Sir . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) What have you to say for yourself ? Prisoner . Please you , my Lord , I overtook Dell and Bowden upon the Road ; they desir 'd me to drive the Lambs along and never overtook me . Q . Have you any Witnesses to call ; Prisoner . No , my Lord . Guilty Death . 272 , 273. Martin M'Lone and William Bruce were indicted for assaulting Thomas Smith on the Highway , and taking from him a Peruke , a Silk Handkerchief and 8 s. 10 d. in Money . Q . ( to Thomas Smith . ) What are you ? Smith . I am a Post-Boy at the Green-Man at Barnet . On the 23th of May , in Whitson Week , as I was coming from St. Albans to Barnet , between the 12 and 13 Mile Stone , in my Way down the Hill , several Men were walking in the Road before , I took them for Travellers ; when I overtook them one came on one Side of the Chaise , two on the other , and two before the Horses Heads . The Prisoner at the Bar was in a blue Coat with white Buttons and Button-Holes , and had Freckles in his Face . Bruce came to me and said , d - n you do n't look at me , let me have your Money ; I said , Gentlemen I will , do n't use me ill , I am but a poor Post-Boy . They haul 'd me out of the Chaise , and seeing the Irish Mail , said they would not meddle with that ; but they took my Wig and Handkerchief . Q . What else ? Smith . They rifled my Pockets , and said , let us take his Breeches . Q . What did they do then ? Smith . They took 8 s. 10 d. from me . I saw a Gentleman coming towards Barnet , and immediately three or four of them went off to meet him , and several Blows pass 'd . They all ran off from me but one of them . Q . How far was the Gentleman from you ? Smith . About twenty Yards . Q . Did you know the Gentleman ? Smith . Yes , he keeps the Cock Inn at Oney , his Name is Knight . While they had him down one of them came to me and said , G - d d - n you go along ; another damn 'd me and said I should not go : So I said , Gentlemen , you need not be afraid of me , I wo n't betray you ; with that they said , go along , my Lad , as fast as you can ; so I drove up the Hill as hard as ever I could . Q . Where was the Gentleman all this while ? Smith . Upon his Back , they knock 'd him down . When I came to the Top of the Hill I met a Waggon , or Cart , and said , Master , for God 's sake do n't go down , there are Thieves at the Bottom of the Hill , you will certainly be robb 'd . When I came to the Crown I saw a Light ; I jump 'd out of my Chaise and went into the House . They ask 'd who was there . I said , Gentlemen , pray go down , I believe there is a Gentleman murder 'd at the Bottom of the Hill . Q . Where was this ? Smith . At the Crown at Kicks-End ; one John Nickerson and two Soldiers were there ; I believe they all went ; I did not stay to go with them , but made the best of my way home . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) Will you ask this Boy any Questions ? Prisoner . Please you , my Lord , I have no Questions to ask him ? Q . ( to John Toby Reynolds . ) What do you know of this Affair ? Reynolds . My Lord , I know nothing of the Felony , only some Circumstances while the Men were in Custody . I live at Barnet . Q . Where did you find them ? Reynolds . My Lord , they were in the Cage , these two and four more . They seem 'd to be Irishmen . My Lord , we examin 'd their Pockets , and found several Letters directed to Persons in London , recommending them to Business , and a Horn which had a small Quantity of Powder ; after we had done that , the Post-Boy came into the Cage . I said to the Boy , be careful what you do , look among them and see if any of these Men have robb 'd you ; then the Boy went directly into the Middle of them as they were in the Cage , and said to Bruce , the Prisoner , you are the Man : Says Bruce , I did not rob you . The Boy said , you did not rob me , but you are the Man that presented the Pistol , and you are the Man that bid me not look in your Face . Q . What did he say to that ? Reynolds . I do n't remember , my Lord , what Answer he made . Q . ( to Thomas Nichols ) Was you one of those that pursu 'd the Prisoner ? Nichols . Please you my Lord , I was at the Crown at Kicks-End when the Boy came in , and said he was robb 'd by seven Irishmen , and that they were murdering a Gentleman ; and these Men we took upon Suspicion . Court . After this you pursu 'd , Did you ? Nichols . Yes , my Lord , we went thither and pursu 'd them ; I was after four by myself ; and when they saw me , they d - d me , saying , There is but one , shoot him : But when another Person came up they ran away , and we pursu 'd and took them all . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Nichols . They were both together when we took them . Q . Where were they when you took them ? Nichols . In the Bottom by Kicks-End . Q . What became of the other four ? Nichols . We brought them all before the Justice , but because no one appear 'd against them , he releas 'd them . Q . When you took them , then what did they say ? Nichols . Some said they were come from Ireland , and wanted Work . Q . Where did you carry them ? Nichols . We carried them to the Crown that Night , and they were carried afterwards before Justice Hassel . Q . Do you know any Thing farther ? Nichols . No , my Lord . Q . ( to Asbury ) Was you one of the Pursuers ; do you know any Thing more than Mr. Nichols says ; do you remember the two Prisoners ? Asbury . I kick 'd up Martin M Lone 's Heels in the Field ; when we went down there were five of us together : I said to my Partner , let us go overagainst the Waggon , left they should see us . Q . Are you sure that Mc Lone was the Man you trip 'd up ? Asbury . Yes , my Lord . Q . What do you say of the other Man ? Asbury . These two were taken with the six . Q . ( to Bruce ) Now is the Time to make your Defence ; the Post-Boy charges you with the Robbery . Prisoner . Please your Honour I came out of Ireland to look for Work , I was fearce of Money , and was returning Home ; I lay at the Upper End of Barnet ; I would have paid for Lodging , but they said I was an Irishman and they would not let me have any . We were very cold when the Day-light came ; as we were cold we said to one another , we had better be going to Coventry , to get what would carry us Home . MartincLone Acquitted . Bruce Guilty Death . 274. Johannah Wood was indicted for coining 30 Pieces call 'd stallings , and one Piece call 'd a Half Cown , & c . Council . I am Council in this Cause for the Crown ; the Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted of High Treason , for counterfeiting the current Coin of these Realms ; it is unnecessary for me to tell you , Gentleman , that it becomes the Prerogative of the Crown to take Care of the Coin of the Kingdom ; it will be needless to mention to you the Inconveniency and Injury that must accrue by these counterfeit Pieces , as Shillings and Half Crowns , which generally fall hard among the poorer Sort of People : The single Question will be , whether the Prisoner at the Bar has been guilty of the present Offence or not ; and , Gentleman , as she stands indicted for actual coining , I shall candidly admit we have no Evidence present at the Time of Coining ; I do n't apprehend it is necessary ; because Persons going to commit an Offence of so high a Nature , will hardly call Witnesses at the Time when they commit the Offence ; I shall only relate the Circumstances , Gentleman , and when I have open 'd the Nature of our Evidence there will appear Reason to believe that the Prisoner at the Bar has been guilty of the Offence for which she is indicted : The cause of our Suspicion was upon this Occasion ; she went to a Person that sold Straw and Leghorn Hats , I think the Agreement was for 18d . after that Agreement had been made she gave Half a Crown for the Payment of this Hat ; that Half Crown was a counterfeit one ; on finding this out she was immediately carried before a Magistrate , I believe our present Lord Mayor , and for that was committed ; that giving Occasion a little to enquire into her Life and Conversation ; she has acknowledg 'd , as I am told , and I have to prove , that she has been guilty of these Sorts of Offences for 25 Years past ; but that is not the Case for which she is indicted , but for actual coining , Gentlemen ; as for that Half Crown which she has utter 'd she may possibly be to answer for on another Occasion , tho ' that may be a material Circumstance to convict her of the Offence she is now charg 'd with . The Solicitor for the Crown , who is concern 'd for the Mint , and whose Duty it is to bring all Persons who have committed Offences of this Kind to Justice , being inform 'd that if he went to the Prisoner 's Lodgings he would not only find a great Quantity of counterfeit Money , but the Tools by which the said Money was counterfeited , and was likewise directed to turn up a board at the Foot of her Bed , where the said Tools were conceal 'd ; accordingly he went to the Place as directed in the Information that had been given him , and taking up the Board found there a good Number , above thirty Shillings actually coin 'd and counterfeited , and this Half Crown ; the Reason I mention the Half Crown is , that it exactly tallied and was certainly struck in the same Mold with that which was put off by the Prisoner at the Bar , therefore that will be some Circumstance to induce you to believe that the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person that coin 'd them . We will call our Witnesses to shew that this Woman was first committed for vending this Half Crown ; and her Confession shews that she has long been concern 'd in Practices of this Nature . Q . ( to - Hudson ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Did she lodge at your House ? Hudson . Yes , at my House the next Door to Gray-Inn-Lane Workhouse . Q . In what Room did she lodge there ? Hudson . In two Rooms up one Pair of Stairs . Q . When did she lodge at your House ? Did she lodge there before the 1st of May ? Hudson . She came the 6th of March . Q . Did she lodge there the 1st , 2d , 3d or 4th of May ? Hudson . She was not there ; I think she lay out the last Day of April . Q . Were the Lodgings her 's after that ? Hudson . I ca n't tell how it was between her and the other Woman ; they took them together as I took it . Q . Do you remember the Time that this Woman was taken up for uttering a bad Half Crown ? Hudson . I never knew it 'till Mr. North came to our House the 6th of May . Q . What did Mr. North come there upon ? Hudson . Mr. North and another Gentleman and the Constable came there the 6th of May . Q . How long had she lodg 'd there ? Hudson About seven Weeks ; and the back Room was the Room where she lay . Q . Did the other Woman continue to be three after the 1st of May ? Hudson . Sir , she was acquitted by my Lord Mayor , she lodg 'd there one Night and no more . Q . What Night was that ? Hudson . The Day that she was acquitted by my Lord Mayor . Q . Which was the Night the Prisoner at the Bar left your Lodgings , and did not come home ? Hudson . Neither of them came home that Night . Q . Did Mr. North come to your House ? Hudson . Yes , my Lord ; I saw several Things ; there were some Pieces of bad Money . Q. Pray what else ? Hudson . There were two large white Papers . Q . What was in them ? Hudson . I can not say , there were some Materials took out , Instruments of Coining . Q . What ? Hudson . I ca n't tell . There were other Instruments taken out that Mr. North saw ; there were Shillings and a Half Crown which the Gentlemen let me see . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Have you any Thing to say to this Witness ? Prisoner . The Woman took the Room ; I had no Concern in taking it . - North . My Lord , as to the Prisoner at the Bar , I have known her some Years , and she has been under frequent Prosecutions for uttering of counterfeit Money . Court . Pray Mr. North keep to Fact . North . I will . On the 5th or 6th Day of May I receiv 'd a Letter by the Penny-Post without any Name , that inform 'd me that if I went to Mrs. Wood 's Lodgings , at Mr. Hudson House , and took up a Board at the Feet of her Bed , I should there find several of her Materials ; accordingly I took a Person along with me , who is now in Court , to be an Assistant , and we went to the Lodgings and took up the Board mention 'd in the Letter ; he said here are the Things : I saw him take out of the Place this Pair of Flasks , in which the Earth is contain 'd , and these two Pieces of Metal . Q . What Metal do you call it ? North . Grain Tin , the better Sort : These Shillings were wrapt up in a separate Paper , in the Condition they are now , which we take to be finish 'd . Q . How many were there of these Shillings ? North . I believe about 35 or 36 . Among the rest of the Things , were these other counterfeit Shillings , quite finish 'd , and this Half Crown , my Lord . Q . ( to Philip Shearer ) Are you the Constable ? Shearer , Yes . Q . Did you go to search the Lodgings of Mrs. Wood ? What did you find there ? Shearer . At the Foot of the Bed , there was a Board about 18 Inches long and nine broad , it was cut so artfully that the Nails came up with the Board ; I said , Here 's the Nest . I took out , I think , thirty-six Shillings , a Half-Crown , and a Mould , that Mr. North said they cast their Money in . Q . ( to Mr. North ) Is this the same ? North . Yes , I have had it in my Custody ever since . Q . ( to Diana White ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? White . I know her to be the Woman that gave me the bad Half-Crown . She came into my House in Newgate-Street , to buy a Hat , about six Weeks ago , and paid me with the bad Half-Crown : With that I took hold of her , and said , You are a Coiner ; then I saw her begin to convey something to another . I said , I 'll search you . Q . What did you do with the Half-Crown ? White . The Constable has it . Q . ( to Mr. Welsh ) Had you the Counterfeit Half-Crown deliver 'd to you by that Woman ? Welsh . Yes , my Lord , and a Shilling likewise . Q . ( to Mr. North ) Is that a Counterfeit Half-Crown ? Q . Yes , and exactly the same Die , & c.
