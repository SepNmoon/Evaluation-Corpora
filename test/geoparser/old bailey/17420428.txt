They were a second Time indicted for assaulting . Robert Rumley , in a certain Field , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , value 5 l. the Goods of Thomas Bartrup , and 15 s. the Money of the said Rumley . Edmund Smith . On Sunday the 18th of October last between 7 and 8 at Night , I was met just on this Side the Back of the Bowling Green , in Stepney-Fields , by two Footpads , who stopp 'd me , and demanded my Money . They took from me my Watch , and 4 or 5 s. in Silver , or something more , and then made off towards Ratcliff . It was a very dark Night , and I was very much frighted , so that I ca n't say that I know any Thing of the Persons . My Watch was afterwards offer 'd to pawn to Mr. Warner , in King-Street , near Tower-Hill , and after making some Enquiry , I found it there , and had it again . - Cresswell . I live with Mr. Warner . On the 20th of October , the Prisoner Wood brought this Watch to our House to pledge . He ask 'd a Guinea upon it , and accordingly had it . About three Days afterwards he came for the Watch , and had it out again . On the 27th of October he brought it again , and had a Guinea and half upon it , and he never came to enquire for it afterwards . Pris . Wood . I bought this Watch at a public House : I humbly recommend it to your Consideration , that if I had stolen the Watch , I should not have pawn 'd it in my own Name , and in my own Neighbourhood . Jury to the Prosecution . Are the Prisoners like the two Persons who robb 'd you ? Mr. Smith I ca n't pretend to say that I made any Remarks of them . Robert Rumley . On the 23d of October last , between eight and nine in the Evening , I was stopped by two Men arm 'd with Horse-Pistols , in the large Field adjoining to Whitechappel-Mount . They made Use of a great many Oaths and Imprecations , and demanded my Money . I gave them about 15 s. and a Silver Watch , which was the Property of Thomas Bartrup , the Maker Graham , No . 101 . These Men in Stature exactly answer 'd the Prisoners ; the short Man was in blue grey , he had on a Pair of red Breeches , and I think he was mask 'd , for I could not see his Countenance . The other Man had a light coloured loose great Coat , and a light colour 'd Wig , and was not mask 'd , but I could not distinguish his Face . I advertis 'd the Watch , and about three Days afterwards it was brought to me by Mr. Jacobson . - Jacobson . On the 24th of October , Samuel Wood brought a Watch to my House , and desir 'd to have a Guinea and a half upon it . I asked him where he liv 'd ? he said , he was a Midshipman belonging to the Greenwich Man of War , and appearing handsomely dress 'd , I lent him the Money upon it . I happen 'd to be at the Coffee-House the Tuesday following , and saw this very Watch advertis 'd , and next Morning I carried it to Mr. Finch 's in Lambard-Street , according to the Direction in the Advertisement . Pris . Wood . According to the best of my Remembrance , this Gentleman said before Mr. Deveil , that he took my Name down , and where I liv 'd , and when he found the Watch was stolen , why did he not send and secure me ? Jacobson . I took no Account where he liv 'd : he told me he came up to Town with the Lieutenant to see after some Men who had run away from the Ship . Alice Richard . The Prisoners being arrested , they sent me with another Woman to fetch the Watches out of Pawn . Craycraft desired Mrs. Carter to give a Letter to this Gentleman . I saw him deliver the Letter to her ; it was seal 'd up , and the Purport of it was , to desire the Gentleman to let us have the Watches , by the same Token , that one of the Prisoners had fetch 'd a Hinger out of Pawn about a Week before . Craycraft said one of the Watches was his , and the other Mr. Wood 's , and he hop 'd the Pawnbrokers would let them be sold for more Money , or else buy them themselves . We went according to their Direction to these Pawnbrokers ; but one of them had carried the Watch home that was pawn 'd with him : and the other Pawnbroker refused to deliver his to any Person but the right Owner . Jacobson . I did receive a Letter sign 'd Samuel Wood , but it was two Months after I had delivered the Watch . Richard . We carried two Letters , one to each Pawnbroker . James Barnes . I am an Officer and arrested the two Prisoners for a Debt which they had contracted . I kept them at my own House the twenty-four Hours , which I had a Right to do , and then I was for carrying them to Prison . They told me , they had some Watches and lac 'd Waistcoats in Pawn , and desired me to keep them a Day longer at my House , that they might sell them , and make it up with the Plaintiff . They had no Money , so I ask 'd them what they would leave me for what they had eat and drank at my House ? they said , they had a Brace of Pistols which were lock 'd up in a 'Scrutore in their Lodging , but the Landlord would not let me have them . I then carry 'd them to Goal , where they remain 'd about six Weeks , and then were discharged . After this , Mrs. Richards fell out with them , and inform 'd me of a Letter which she had carry 'd concerning some Watches , and Jacobson telling me where he had deliver 'd one of them , I found out the Prosecutor , who gave me an Account of his being robb 'd . Upon this , I got a Warrant against the Prisoners , and they immediately flew from the Place which they frequented in Wild street , to Deptford , where I took them . I call 'd Wood into a Corner , and ask 'd him whether he had not better save his own Life and make a Discovery ? He told me , he could not hang two , for what Robberies he had committed , were with Craycroft alone . - Rose . On the 7th of March , Mr. Barnes and I went to Deptford in Pursuit of the Prisoners , and on Monday Morning between 9 and 10 o'Clock , we were waiting in a Yard , and saw them go by the Door . We went after them and took them into a Public-house . Barnes took Wood into a Corner of the Room , and ask 'd him if any Body else was concern 'd with him , and he said , he never was concern 'd with any body but Craycraft . Wood . Did you find any Thing upon us when we were taken into Custody ? Rose . No . John Thwaites . I have known Wood twelve Years , and all the Time I have known him , I never heard any Thing amiss of him . I never heard of his being at Sea . Joseph Wingree . I have known Wood between 4 and 5 Years , I brew 'd at his Master 's on Peter's-Hill . A very pretty Scholar he is to be sure , and behav 'd himself very handsomely . Robert Downing . I have known him some Years , and never heard any harm , or knew any by him . As for his Parents , they are very honest People , and brought him up in good Learning . James Thwaites . I know Samuel Wood , and I am sorry such a Misfortune should happen to him now : I really believe he will reform ; I hope so , and never be guilty of the like any more . Edmund Cadle . I knew all his Friends vastly well , and he was a civil young Man , and always behav 'd well . John Clark . I have known that Gentleman at the Bar , Sam Wood , ever since he was 10 Years old , and never knew any Harm of him . Wm Gardner . I have known him ten Years , and never knew no other but that he was a civil , honest , sober young Man . John Flavil . I have known Sam Wood a great while , and never heard any Harm of him . Thomas Cleeve . I have very little Knowledge of either of the Prisoners , but I went with Wood 's Father to Mr. Rumley , and he said , he was very sorry he was put on to prosecute , for he would rather have lost all the Things . Mr. Rumley . Wood 's Father and this Gentleman desired me to be as favourable as I could . I told them I could not , but must speak the Truth according to the best of my Judgment . Wm Fowler . I have been a Lodger in Wood 's Father 's House for 20 Months I never saw the Prisoner disguis 'd in Liquor , but he always behaved himself with Duty and Respect . For Craycroft no one appeared . Wood guilty Death . Craycroft acquitted . 3 . + John Carpenter , of Harmonsworth , was indicted for stealing 2 Weather Sheep , val . 30 s. the Property of Isaac Singer , Jan 9 . Isaac Singer . I lost two Weather Sheep on the 9th of January last , out of my Fold in the Parish of Harmonsworth . My Shepherd came to me in the Morning in a great Hurry , and told me he miss 'd two Sheep ; they were mark 'd R S on the near hind Hip . I ask 'd him if he was sure that he had them in the Fold ? He said he was , because as he was driving them along , a piece of a Bush stuck in one of them , and this very Sheep was one that was lost . He likewise told me that he saw 3 Men go by the Fold over Night , upon which I went to Sir Thomas Reynolds , and got a Warrant to search the House of * Joseph Pigg : Just as we got to Pigg 's Door , and Chance came out of the House and ran away . We went up Stairs , and in the Chimney corner I saw something cover 'd with a sort of a Rug ; I pull 'd the Rug away and found my two Sheep-skins , and on putting the Skins away I saw a couple of Butter Firkins , in which were the Blood and the Guts . After that , I search 'd a little Closet , and found a whole Carcase wrapp 'd up in a Cloth , and another cut into Quarters . The next Day I sent 5 or 6 Men and Horses after the Men that ran away ; they took Pigg and Chance , but the Prisoner has escap 'd 'till now . * Pigg was tried for this Fact last Sessions and convicted . James Tillier . My Master lost two Weather Sheep , and we found them in Joseph Pigg 's House ; I am sure the Skins were his . I saw Pigg , Chance and the Prisoner go by the Fold about 4 in the Afternoon ; they look 'd very hard at me and I at them , and took particular Notice of them . The next Morning I went into the Fold among the Sheep , and miss 'd two , one of them had a Bush upon him , and which I pull 'd off over Night . Jeremiah Chance . John Carpenter , Pigg and I took two Sheep out of a Fold ; I ca n't say whose Fold it was , but we saw a young Man sitting by it over Night , to the best of my Knowledge it was this Man ( Tillier ) I ca n't tell when this was , but I remember it was the Night before they came to search Pigg 's House . I gave Pigg a Shilling to fetch some Bread and Beer , and he went to an Alehouse , but came back again without it , and told his Wife they were coming to search . I was then cutting out one of the Sheep in a little Closet , and his Wife desired me to stay and not leave her alone . She gave me some Carpenter 's Tools to carry out , and I dropp 'd them at the Door , and met a great many People coming to search for the Sheep . I walk 'd pretty leisurely 'till I got past the People ; and when I got out of Sight I ran , and made the best of my way for Staines , and as I was going across the Moor , I met with Pigg , and we went together to one Clements 's , at Grubb 's Hill in Surrey , and Carpenter the Prisoner came there to us . I ca n't say that I remember any particular Discourse between us , but Pigg went on the Sunday following to see his Wife and was apprehended for this Fact . A Witness . The Prisoner 's Friends liv 'd at Staines : I put him Apprentice myself , and never heard but that he was an honest industrious Fellow . His Friends are as honest People as ever were born . Guilty , Death . He was a second Time indicted for stealing two Weather Sheep , val . 40 s. the Property of John Dalton , Dec. 25 . John Dalton . I lost four Sheep , two on Christmas-Eve , and two the Night before . I afterwards found the Skin of one of them hung upon a Cherry-tree , but the Fat and Carcase were gone . I likewise found the Skin of another in another Ground , and the Head with it . Jeremiah Chance . I ca n't say from whom we stole these Sheep , but on Michaelmas Eve , Nat . Millis , Carpenter and I went and met Pigg , and going along , Carpenter and Millis went into a Barn , and took two Sacks , after which we went to Staines , and took two Sheep . This was on Michaelmas Eve and I never had been there before , but I remember we went over a sort of a Stile , and into a Ground by a Hay-rick . Dalton . I believe they drove the Sheep in there , for the Blood was run into the Ground , and one of the Skins was buried in the Hay . Q to Chance . Are you sure the Prisoner was with you on this Errand ? Chance . Yes , we fetch 'd three Sheep up , and to the best of my Knowledge there was one Bell Sheep among them . We catch 'd a couple , and that which Carpenter had was not a very good one , so we let it go , and took another . I think likewise there was a Black Sheep among them . Dalton . I had one Bell Sheep and a Black one among mine . Guilty , Death . 4. Edmund Larrat , of Stepney , was indicted for stealing a weather Sheep , val . 40 s. the Property of Thomas Wigans , April 11 . Thomas Wigans . I lost a Weather Sheep out of Poplar Marsh , and Mr. Grainger a Carpenter , informing me that he had found some Wooll in John Poor 's Lodgings , I had him taken up , and carried before a Justice , who admitted him an Evidence against the Prisoner . As to the Prisoner , I ca n't say any thing against him , only that we found two Skins in his Vault , but I ca n't swear them to be mine . Arthur Grainger . The Prisoner is a Tenant to me at Limehouse . I sent a Man to clean out a House of my Brother 's which was empty , and he informed me that the Boards were pull 'd down between that House and the next , so that a Man could go out of one House into the other . He told me there was some Wooll , and part of a Hide , but he could neither make one thing or t'other of it . I ask 'd him how long he thought it might have been taken off the Sheep ? He said he could not tell . Upon this I acquainted the the Butchers in the Butcher row of this , and we appointed to meet hard by Limehouse Church . The Prisoner generally was out in the Day Time , so Mr. Wigans and I went into the empty House to view the Skin , but we could not make any thing of it by the Marks . We then got a Candle and look 'd down the Vault of the empty House , and saw a Sheep-skin at the Bottom of it . After this we got a Warrant from Justice Jones , and went to the Prisoner 's Lodgings , designing to search there , and accordingly I endeavour 'd to go into one Room , but a Woman who was there refus 'd to let me come in . I then went up Stairs , but finding nothing , I came down again , and pull 'd back the Spring Lock of the Room Door , into which I had been refus 'd Admittance , and went in : there I saw three Parts of five Sheep cut out ; this was in the Room on the Ground Floor . I likewise search 'd a Cup-board on the Stairs , and found a parcel of Fat , which I suppose belong 'd to the Sheep that were cut out as I have mentioned . John Poor . On the 17th of April , the Prisoner desired me to go down with him into the Marsh at Poplar . It was between 9 and 10 at Night , as near as I can guess . He laid a Plank over the Ditches , and we by that means got into the Field . He then caught a Sheep and kill 'd it , after which he took out the Guts and ridded the Fat and put it into a Bag . After that he cut the Sheep in halves , and put one half in one Bag , and the other half in another . Then we went over the Plank again and brought it Home . Q . What did he do with the Skin ? Poor . I ca n't tell , I did not see him skin it . He carry 'd the Sheep Home and put it down on the Floor in the lower Room . He then try 'd the Fat in an iron Pot , and went out with Ann Macdonnald to sell it . Q . How came he to take you with him to steal this Sheep ? Poor . I help 'd him to carry it Home : I was a little in Liquor , and he persuaded me to go down into the Marsh with him to take a Sheep . Q . How do you know that the Prisoner went to sell the Fat ? Poor . He told me he would . I know this was Mr. Wigan 's Sheep because he miss 'd it out of an enclosed Place where he puts his Sheep . Jury . I think he says he went over the Ditch into the Marsh , where was he when the Sheep was skin 'd that he did not see it ? Poor . It was not skin 'd there , but carried home in the Skin ; he cut it in two without skinning . Pris . Ask him if he had any Part of the Money ? Poor . I had no part of any Money except what the Fat sold for Pris . I never ask 'd him to go with me ; it was his own Proposal . William Rogers . I am Marsh-man , and I look after the Marshes for a great many Butchers . I saw the Meat in the Prisoner 's House , but the Skin was so bad , that we could not make any Thing of it . There was a good Shoulder , and there was a Leg and a Loin that lay in the Hole and stunk ; this was about 3 Weeks ago , and the Day after we miss 'd the Sheep . Pris . This Thing that he charges me with , I did not steal it , I found it by the Shipwright 's Yard , just by Limehouse Causeway . Guilty , Death . 5 + Elizabeth Powel , of St. Martin in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a lac 'd Mob , val . 1 l. 2 Linnen Aprons , val . 4 s. a silk Handkerchief , val . 2 s. a Case of Instruments , val . 4 s 28 Portugal Pieces , val . 43 l. 4 s. a 2 Guinea Piece , 9 Guineas and 15 s. the Goods and Money of Martha Hammers , in her Dwelling house , March 29. Martha Hammers . On the 29th Day of March last , the Prisoner robb 'd my House in Hungerford-Market , of a Mob , 2 Aprons , and several other Things mention 'd in the Indictment , and about 50 l. in Money . They were taken out of the Drawers in my Bed-chamber . The Prisoner had been my Servant about nine Months before , and I did not mistrust her 'till I was informed by one Mary Hutchinson that such a Person had such and such Things which I knew to be mine . Upon that I went to seek after them . I took the Prisoner up and carry 'd her before Justice Copeland in Surrey , where she own 'd the Fact and sign 'd her Confession ? Q . Have you any other Knowledge of her taking these Things but by her Confession ? Hammers No ; the Prisoner was search 'd in the Watch-house by the Constable 's Orders before she went to the Justice 's , and there were found upon her a 3 l. 12 s. piece , two 36 s. pieces , a Guinea and 2 s. the rest of the Money was taken from another Person whom she gave it to , and who is a Prisoner in the King 's Bench , his Name is Loveit . Q . How came you to know it was in his Hand ? Hammers . Ann Robinson told me she had deliver 'd the Money to him . When this Money was taken from the Prisoner , she told me I might say what I pleas 'd , but she never wrong 'd me in her Life , but she had my Cap upon her Head at that very Time . Ann Robinson . The Prisoner and I lodg 'd together in East Smithfield . On Monday about 6 o'Clock , - I ca n't tell how long ago it was , but I got up and let in the Prisoner . She had been out all Night , and she told me she had got her Money from her Mother in Law . She shew 'd me a great many pieces of Gold in a little Trunk ; they were very large pieces , and there were a great many of them . She went out and bought herself some Things , and then bought me a Gown , a pair of Stays , and a pair of Shoes , and made me a Present of them . Mary Hutchinson . The Prisoner went out between 7 or 8 on the Sunday Night , and said she was going to her Mother 's to receive 20 l. that was left to her : I believe it was about a Month ago . She came Home between 5 and 6 next Morning , and this Woman ( Robinson ) let her in . She said her Mother refus 'd to let her have the Money , but her Father had taken the Pocket Apron out of a Drawer and had given it to her . She likewise said she had got four Guineas , but I saw none , only some Silver and Half-pence , and a Case of Instruments ; I am no Judge of Instruments , but it was a pretty large Bath-metal Case , and she shew 'd me besides , a clasp Knife and a Bath-metal Thimble . Joseph King , Constable . I saw the Things in this Bag taken from the Prisoner in the Watch-house . I had one 3 l. 12 s. piece , and two 36 s. pieces , a Guinea , 2 s. a lac 'd Mob and this Instrument-case from the Prisoner herself ; the rest of the Things I had from Beaumont Loveit . Andrew Anderson . This lac 'd Mob , I saw on the Prisoner 's Head . King . These are all the Things that I have . This Mob was deliver 'd to me in the Watch-House , but there was such a Hurley Burley , that I ca n't tell from whence it was taken , but the Prisoner gave it to me , and she was bare headed . She gave all the rest of the Things to me , and said there was all she had left of her Mistress 's Mone , and that Beaumont Loveit had taken the rest from her . Upon that I took my Staff , and went directly to Loveit 's ; - he is a Bencher by the Marshalsea . I knock 'd at the Door and ask 'd him for the Money : he told us , his Girl had burnt the Trunk which it was in ; but he pulled down a little Box like a Chest of Drawers , and produc 'd this Money . I told him he had better return it ; but he refus 'd to deliver it to me , so he went with us to the Watch-House , and laid down 19 l. 13 s. in the Prisoner 's presence , and said , that was all he had ; the Prisoner answer 'd , No , Mr. Loveit , you have more . Prosecutrix . This Mob and Instrument Case are mine , and were lost out of my House with the Money . The Prisoner confess 'd when she was at the Watch-House that she had conceal 'd herself in my House all Night , and that the Money which was taken from her was mine . Q . When did you see your Money last before you miss 'd it ? Prosecutrix I saw it that very Day in the Child 's Trunk in my Drawer . Hutchinson . This is the same Instrument Case that the Prisoner shew 'd to me . Mr. Anderson . I went with Mrs. Hammers in quest of the Prisoner to her Lodging , but she was gone out . We were very industrious in enquiring after her at several Places , and at last we took her in Kent street , and carry 'd her before the Constable in the Watch-house , and upon searching her , these Things were found upon her . When this Money was taken out of her Pocket , she said that was all the Money she had : I ask 'd her what she had done with the rest ? for it was but two Days after the Robbery , and there was 60 l. 9 Shillings lost in all . Robinson inform 'd me , that the Prisoner had given the rest of the Money to Beaumont Loveit . I then applied to Mr. King for Assistance , to go to Loveit , and we accordingly went to him . I desired him to deliver the Money to the Constable , but he refus 'd for some Time ; at last he agreed to go with us to the Watch-House , and did deliver the Money in the Prisoner 's Presence . John Hodder , Watchman . On the 31st of March , between 10 and 11 o'Clock , Mrs. Hammers and Mr. Anderson came in a Coach to the Watch House , and ask 'd for the Constable . I told them my Master King was gone into the Borough and so my Fellow Servant and I went with Anderson , and took the Prisoner in the Boot Alehouse . She made her Escape from us , and got into Boot Alley , and there we took her again , and brought her to the Watch-House . We found in her Pocket a 3 l 12 s. piece , a 36 s. piece , a Guinea , and some Silver , and the Mob was upon her Head when we put her into the Cage , but she afterwards took it off , and gave it to Mr. Anderson . We then went to Loveit 's , and he brought the rest of the Money to the Watch-House . Pris . Loveit and this young Woman got me in Liquor , and they both held together to take the Money from me as soon as I had got it . Guilty Death . 6 Elizabeth Pinner , was indicted for stealing 2 Cloth Coats , Value 30 s. the Goods of James Stringer , March 27 , And , 7. Richard Wilkinson , for receiving them knowing them to be stolen . Pinner guilty ; Wilkinson acquitted . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 8. , of St. Martin in the Fields , was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on the 15th of April , on John Gilchrist , in the dwelling House of John Naydon , did make an Assault , and with both his Hands , to and against a certain Chair and a boarded Floor , the said Gilchrist did throw , and with both his Hands , divers Times on the Belly of the said Gilchrist did strike , giving him several mortal Bruises , of which he languish 'd to the 16th of the same Month , and then died . He was a second Time charg 'd by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest for Manslaughter . Hugh Heap I was in the Room when the Thing happen 'd ; it was on the 15th of April , the Deceased came into the Room where the Prisoner was drinking , with a Pretence for some Salt , and he accordingly went to the Salt Box to take some out , which I believe was with a full Intention to quarrel with the Prisoner . There were some Words between them , and the Prisoner got up and gave Gilchrist a Push towards the Door , and bid him get out of his Company . Gilchrist then came back again , and the Prisoner a second Time desired him to quit his Company ; upon that , Gilchrist hit the Prisoner a slap on the Face ; they immediately clos 'd , and fell on the Floor together . They had three Falls in the whole , one of them was over a Chair , and in the last Fall , some how or other , Gilchrist got the Prisoner 's Finger in his Mouth , and bit it , and the Prisoner endeavouring to disengage his Finger , had his Thumb bit too . After this , they both got up ; the Prisoner went home with his Mother , and the Deceased sat down in a Chair in the same Room 'till he return 'd . The Prisoner ( when he came back ) offer 'd to call for a Tankard of Beer to drink Friends with Gilchrist , but they did not drink together that I saw . Mr. Gilchrist about 9 or 10 . Minutes afterwards , complain 'd that he was sick , and went home with a Neighbour . C. How long did he live after this ? Heap . As I was inform 'd , about five and twenty Hours : I never saw him afterwards . C. Did you see any Bruise upon him ? Heap . I did not see any thing that could hurt either of them . C. You say when Gilchrist came into the Room for Salt , the Prisoner gave him a Push ? Heap . I believe he came with a full Design to quarrel , for by enquiring afterwards , I found he had nothing to eat with his Salt ; besides they had Words before , and the Prisoner had left his Company the same Day . Neither of the Pushes could hurt him , and he was not hurt by him to the best of my Knowledge . Pris . Q . Was there not a Sash Door going into the Kitchen , through which Gilchrist could see whether I was there or not ? Heap . Yes . Pris . Q . Did I desire him to go out of the Room . Heap . Yes ; he gave him those Pushes , and desired him to walk out of the Room , for he did not care to keep him Company . I heard the Prisoner declare ( the Day before this happen 'd ) to Gilchrist himself , that he never would come into his Company again if he could help it . I have known the Prisoner some Years , and never knew him quarrel with any Body before . As to Gilchrist , here are People that knew him better than I. I never saw him but 3 or 4 Times in my Life , and never drank with him . Thomas Hayes . It happened on the 15th of April last , I went to this Heathcock Alehouse in the Evening as I usually do , and in the Kitchen there are few but Neighbours come in . There is a Sash-Door which parts it from the public Room . When I had been there about a Quarter of an Hour , the Deceased opened the Door , and came in : he push 'd between the Company , and went directly to the Salt Box . As he was going back again , the Prisoner told him he was a Scoundrel , and gave him a Push on the Elbow , such as would not knock down a Child of a Year and half old if it could stand : he bid him get out of hit Company , and repeated his Push , and presently after that , they said Gilchrist struck the Prisoner , but I being behind , did not see the Blow ; however , they presently clos 'd , and threw me , Chair and all down to the Ground . They got up again , and the Deceas 'd fell against the Table , and from thence a-cross a Chair . Q . Did you see the Prisoner do any Thing to him when he was down ? Hayes . No , the Prisoner bid him get up , and said he scorn 'd to take any Advantage of him ; accordingly the Deceased did get up , and they clos 'd and fell a second Time upon the Floor , the Prisoner uppermost : there were no Blows that I perceiv 'd , and I was as near as any body could be . They were not down a quarter of a Minute , but they got up and clos 'd again , and fell a third Time , the Prisoner uppermost again . Then Gilchrist got the Prisoner by the Finger , and in loosing that , he bit his Thumb , and then they both got up again . Counc . Did you not see any violent fighting and Blows ? Hayes . No , only hugging one another and falling . Counc . Did not the Deceased come with Violence against the Table ? Hayes . Yes ; they both came against the Table . Pris Q . Had the Deceas 'd any Occasion to come into that Room at all ? Hayes . No ; for I ask 'd all the People of the House whether he had any Thing to eat , and he had not . I ca n't say what his Pretence was for coming in , but I really believe it was to quarrel , because he peep 'd over the Curtain to see if the Prisoner was there . I have known the Prisoner from his Cradle , living in the same Neighbourhood : I never saw him quarrel in my Life , but he behav 'd always civilly . As to Gilchrist , when he was in Liquor , there was not an iller Temper living , and they tell me , he had not been sober 2 or 3 Days , and he seem 'd to me to be a little in Liquor then . Pris . Q . Do you apprehend any Hurt could proceed from those Falls ? Hayes . No , I do n't apprehend there was the least Damage in the World . Isaac Smith . I believe Mr. Gilchrist was the first Occasion of this Quarrel , because he open 'd the Door , and came into the Kitchen . He went directly to the Salt Box , took some Salt , and in his Return back , stood facing me and 2 or 3 more who sat on the same Bench . The Prisoner said , get out of my Company , what do you follow me for ? you Scoundrel ! He was then sitting on his Seat , and told Gilchrist if he would not go out , he would shove him out , and he then gave the Deceased a Push and he fell into a Chair . The Prisoner again bid him go out ; he said he would not , upon which he gave him another Push , and he fell down again . The Deceased got up , and gave the Prisoner a slap on the Face , upon which they immediately clos 'd , and some how or other the Deceased was shov 'd into a Chair . The Prisoner said , get up you Scoundrel , for I will not take any Advantage of you ; he then got up , and they both clos 'd and fell more . again , and I parted them , after which I saw no Counc . Did the Prisoner seem to have any Prejudice against the Deceas 'd ? Smith . None at all , but the Prisoner , as I was told , absconded his Company that Day in the other Part of the House , and went into the Kitchen to shun him . I saw no more than one Blow , because I had hold of the Prisoner 's Mother , and I did hear one or two more , but I did not see them . Counc . Did you hear the Deceased make any Complaint ? Smith . He made no Complaint at the House , only cryed out , he has hurt me . I went home with him , and carried him up Stairs , and sat him in a Chair by the Bedside . He told me his Belly was hurt , and he liv 'd after this between 25 and 26 Hours . Pris . Q What do you apprehend he went to get Suit for ? Smith . I do n't apprehend he had any Occasion for it , but that he came in on purpose to quarrel . I have known the Prisoner about a dozen Years , he always behav 'd well , but he was not sober at this Time . As to Gilchrist , he was when sober , a peaceable , good-natur 'd Man , but when he was fuddled , as bad as bad could be , and he was then very drunk . Wm Bridges . I was one of the Company , and was drinking in the Room when the Deceased opened the Door and came in . He went directly to the Salt-Box , and turn 'd back and look 'd at us all ; upon which the Prisoner said , get out , you know I will not be in your Company , and gave him a slight shove , and push 'd him against the Door . - not in such a Manner as to hurt him Gilchrist ask 'd him , what he meant ? and then the Prisoner gave him another shove ; with that , Gilchrist struck him in the Face , and they clos 'd together , and fell against the Table , the Table , they fell a-cross a Chair . prisoner bid him get up . for he would take age of him . Gilchrist accordingly got they had another Tustle , and fell on together : they got up again , and and I was not apprehensive that would ensue . They fell a third Time , and then the Deceased got the Prisoner 's Finger in his Mouth , and made him cry out , and in endeavouring to disengage it , the Deceased bit his Thumb . Counc . Was there no Violence us 'd ? Bridges . No more than is generally us 'd in fighting . Counc . When the Deceas 'd was down , did not the Prisoner knee him or beat him ? Bridges No , after it was over , he sat in a Chair , and hung down his Head ; and then went to a Bench , and lay all along and groan 'd . Several People there desir 'd him to go Home , and at last Mr. Smith , and one of the Drawers carried him home . Counc . Before he was carried home , did he not complain of having receiv 'd hurt ? Bridges . He complain 'd that he was not well , - to the nearest of my Thought . I ca n't say how long he liv 'd after this , but I heard next Night that he was dead . Pris . Q . Do you think the Deceased 's real Design was to get some Salt ? Bridges . I believe it was to quarrel , for we enquir 'd whether he had any Thing to eat with that Salt , and we found he had not . I heard that there had been Words between them , and that the Prisoner would not be in his Company if he could help it . Pris . Q . Could Mr. Gilchrist see over the Sash-Door whether I was in the Kitchen ? Bridges . Yes , he was tall enough . The Prisoner bears a very good Character , and is a peaceable , inoftensive Man : As to the other , I apprehended he was in Liquor at that Time . - Jones . I was Journeyman to the Deceased , and was at Home when he was brought in . He was set down in a Chair in the Shop , and he said , he had received his Death that Night , and cry 'd out that he was murder 'd , but did not say by whom . He seem 'd very much disguis 'd in Liquor when he was brought in . Counc . Was he not sober before he died ? Jones . I ca n't tell that . He was brought in about a quarter past ten at Night , and died about twenty-four Hours afterwards . Mary Bineham I was a Lodger in the Deceased 's House , and saw him when he was brought home The first Word he said when he came in was , that he had got his Death 's Wound . He was very much in Liquor , and said sometime afterwards , that he receiv 'd it from the Prisoner . I was frequently with him 'till he died , and he said it was a sad Thing for a Man to be murder 'd so . He died within four and twenty Hours afterwards . C. Was he sober when he died ? Bineham I really ca n't say whether he was sober or not , for he never had any Rest from the Time that he came into the House . Counc . What Character had the Deceas 'd ? was he very Quarrellonic ? Bineham . Not that I know of ; - he was a good-natur 'd , honest Man . - Allen . I was not in the Deceased 's House when he came Home , but I saw him after the Quarrel . He sent for me 3 times before I went to him , but at last I did go to him ; it was then a little after 11 o'Clock , and he was in his Bed . I found him very ill , crying out , my Belly ! my Belly ! I ask 'd him what was the Matter , and he said he was kill 'd by H - J - I ask 'd him how it happen 'd ? he told me , `` He went in to `` fetch some Salt for Billy Nind , and as he came `` back , the Prisoner got up , call 'd him Scoundrel , `` and ask 'd him what Business he had `` there , and gave him a Shove '' . He said , `` They went to fighting , and when he fell `` down , the Prisoner knee 'd him . '' I staid there 'till the Surgeon came , and saw him let Blood , and was with him most part of the next Day . C. Was he sober ? Allen . He was in Liquor when I first saw him , but was very sober the following Day : He gave me this Account at Night , and repeated it again to me the next Day when he was sober . Pris . Q . Was Mrs. Bineham there at the same Time with you ? Allen . I ca n't say ; she was there several Times afterwards . Pris Q Will you take upon you to say that at eight , the Morning the Man was sober ? Allen . Yes , I dare say he was . Mr. Small . Surgeon . I was call 'd to attend the Deceased the 15th of February . He complained of extreme Pain in his Bowels , and seem 'd then to be pretty much in Liquor . I did not know the Man , so that I could not be a Judge whether it was the Liquor , or the Agony of the Pain ; for the Agony was so great , that when I went to open a Vein in his Arm , he could not bear to be stirr 'd without complaining . I visited him next Morning , and he then appear 'd to be in a dangerous Way . I informed another Surgeon of my Name , of the Condition I found him in : and desired him to go and see him ; he accordingly did , and we declared him to be in imminent Danger . I saw him again in the Evening , after which I saw him no more 'till he was dead . C Was he sober when you saw him the next Day ? Mr. Small . He gave distinct Answers both Morning and Evening to what Questions I put to him , and such as I think a sober Man would give ; but I did not ask much about the Thing of him , because the By-standers are much sitter Persons to tell that . C. Did he give you no Account ? Mr. Small . Yes , he said a Man with his Knee ( I think he express 'd it ) stamp 'd upon his Belly . I open 'd his Body in the Presence of two or three Surgeons We found no external Bruises , but the Guts were broke in two different Places , which I apprehend proceeded from a violent Cause , either from a strong Pressure on his Belly , or a violent Blow . As the Man had been drinking , as I heard , for some Days before , the Gut might have been pretty much distended with Liquor , and any Thing of a Pressure or violent Push , might so far drive that Liquor from one Side to another , that where any Hindrance happened it might break the Guts through . C. Is it a usual Thing when the Intestines are not diseas 'd , that they should burst without leaving an outward Mark ? Mr. Small . It is a very unusual Thing , and the Surgeons that were present , were of Opinion that such a Thing might not happen again in an Age There was no Sign of an Inflamation where they were broke , much less or Mortification , for they seem 'd to be as good Order there , as in any other Part . DEFENCE . John Maynard . I live at the Heath Cock . On the 15th of April , the Prisoner and Mr. William Nind came in and sat down in one of the bo ; this was between 3 and 4 o'Clock , and Mr. Gilchrist was then in the Kitchen . He went but in a short Time with Mr. Smith , and sat in the same Box where the Prisoner and Nind were drinking . They call 'd for a Tankard of Beer , and I drew it ; Smith paid for it , and went away ; then Gilchrist began to quarrel with the Prisoner , and said , D - n you , you Dog , I will fight you now , or at any time ; I will kill you . The Prisoner told him he would not have any Thing to say to him , and would not keep him Company . Gilchrist then took the Prisoner by the Nose , and struck him in the Face , and Nind standing up , Gilchrist struck him two Smacks in the Face . The Prisoner then paid his Reckoning , and went away to Mr. Smith 's , and about 6 o'Clock came in again , and sat down in the Kitchen . The Deceased was then asleep in a Box in the other Room , and was very much in Liquor . I did not see him go into the Kitchen , neither did I see any thing of the Quarrel , but I am certain he had no Occasion for Salt , for no Body in that Room had any thing to eat with it . As to Gilchrist 's Character , he was when sober , very good-natur 'd , but when he was in Liquor he would make a great Disturbance in the House . John Lambert I draw Beer at the Heath-cock , and remember the Afternoon that the Quarrel happen 'd . The Prisoner and Mr. Nind were at out House together between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon . The Prisoner made an Officer to go into the Kitchen , but seeing the Deceased there , he drew back , and said , Gentlemen , I beg Pardon . They then went into the other Room , and call 'd for Beer and Tobacco . When they had been there about half an Hour , the Deceased went out , but soon return 'd with Mr. Smith ; and went into the Box where the Prisoner and Nind were drinking . Smith said the Reckoning and went away , leaving Gilchrist behind . Then the Deceased began to quarrel , and call 'd the Prisoner Scoundrel and Villain . The Prisoner desired him to be quiet , and got up to go on , upon which Nind desired , him to stay , and then the Deceased took him by the Nose , and gave him a slap in the Face . The Prisoner never offer 'd to strike him or lift up his Hand ; but immediately paid his Reckoning and went out . C. Before the Prisoner went away , did the Deceas 'd use any particular Expressions ? Lambert . Yes , he said he would fight him , the Prisoner in a merry way reply 'd , What will you fight meant ? Why D - you ( said the Deceased ) at Sword and Pistol , and I will not leave you alive . Gilchrist was very drunk at that Time . Between 6 and 7 in the Evening , the Prisoner and Smith came in again together , and sat in the Kitchen . The Deceased was then asleep in one of the Boxes , and did not wake 'till between 9 and 10 . Then he got up and rubb 'd his Eyes , and look 'd over the Sash-door of the Kitchen . Observing the Prisoner there , he went in towards the Chimney for some Salt , - Mr. Nind , nor any of the Company had nothing in the World to eat . I then went down for Beer , and when I came up again , I heard a rumbling and Noise in the Kitchen . I open 'd the Door and saw the Deceased strike the Prisoner in the Face . Then they collar 'd each other , and fell a-cross the Back of a Chair . The Prisoner got up , and told the Deceased he would not use him ill , and I believe no Hurt could happen , for the Prisoner got up that Minute from him . C. Did Mr. Gilchrist seem to be sober . Lambert He was pretty much fuddled , but had recover 'd something : - I had known him half a Year and never saw him right sober in my Life . C. Was he apt to be quarrelsome in Liquor ? Lambert . He would curse and swear and quarrel with any Body that spoke to him . The Prisoner always behav 'd well , and I never saw him quarrel . C. How many Falls did you see between them ? Lambert Two in all ; the first was a-cross a Chair , and the Gilchrist made up to the Prisoner again , but missing his Blow , run his Head against the Chimney-piece . Then they tumbled against the Side of a Table bound round with Iron . I did not see the Prisoner strike him or knee him , for as soon as they were down , one or two of the Company took them up directly . Guilty , Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 9.

Robert Test depos 'd , that when the Prisoner came the second Night to Mrs. Bakewell 's , the Key of the Room was demanded that they might see whether all the Goods were safe .

Elizabeth Bennet . When I was brought to Newgate , the Prisoner demanded a Shilling for Wd dues : I told her I had no Money , but if she would please to stay 'till my Friends came , I would give it to her . She said that would not do , for she must have something in Pledge . I told her I had nothing to give her but my Gown , and I was not willing to part with that ; upon that she and two more fell a swearing at me , and she said she would take it off by Violence if I would not give it her . I ask 'd her whether she could answer stripping People ? She said , - yes , who could hinder her , and then she took my Gown off my Back by Force , and I have never seen it since . I demanded it again once since that Time ; and she said she could not give it me without I gave her the Shilling . She has often desired me to take it out before I had my Tryal , or else I could not have it all . Pris . I was made a Ward-woman by the Partners , and when I got a Shilling I always gave them 9 d. out of it , and they told me if People had no Money , I must make it , or else I must pay it myself ; and as for this Gown , the Prosecutor was starving with Cold and Hunger , and pull 'd it off and I lent her 7 d. half penny upon it . Bennet . I never receiv 'd a Farthing of her in my Life . Mary Smith . I am a Prisoner , and saw the Prosecutor when she was going to pay her Dues .

Margaret Wheatley , I heard the Ward woman ask the Prosecutor to pull off her Gown for her Ward dues ; she said she would not , but the Prisoner bid her strip , for she must have her Dues , and she accordingly had the Gown , but I could not see whether she took it off herself , for I was a-bed Margaret Clark . I know nothing at all but that the Prisoner behav 'd in a civil Manner , as ing any Person , I saw nothing of it .

Some time in August , I was coming from Hackney , and in Well-street , just by the Sugar-Baker 's , the Prisoner push 'd me into a House ; - I ca n't tell the Day , for I never design 'd to trouble my Head with her , if she had not made her Binggs that she had robb 'd me . One end of th is Well-street , comes into Rosemary-Lane , the other into Rag-fair , and there the Prisoner and another Woman pick 'd me up , and would have had me into a House with them , but I being unwilling , they push 'd me in .

I believe it was Mrs. Murray 's House , but nobody lives in it now , for it is knock 'd all to Pieces . When I came in Doors , there were three Men in the Room and two Women , they had got a Stinkabus of Gin , and I would have given them a Gold Ring to let me go , but that would not satisfie them , for they stripp 'd me stark naked . The first Things they took were my Hat and Wig , which were better than those I have on now , and my Shoes I have now at Home , - I wish I had brought them with me . After they had taken my Cloaths , they all ran away , and I was forc 'd to send for more , for I could not go home naked . They put me into a sad Fright , for they threaten 'd my Life , and if I offer 'd to stir or speak a Word , they would , & c I was in so much Fear , that I cry 'd and look 'd out of the Window like a Madman ; they stupified me , and burnt Liquor under my Nose ; but I ca n't imagine how they got my Shirt off .

She ask 'd me some Questions , and then we agreed to go in and drink . She call 'd for a Quartern of Gin , and after that , for a Pint of Hot , and then we went into another Room , where we stood pretty close together , and so she got the Money from me , and whipp 'd out of the House . I immediately felt for my Purse , but it was gone , and I then cry 'd Stop her ! Stop her ! but nobody did . I being a Countryman , did not know what to do , but this Gentleman , the Constable , went with me to the Justice , and got a Warrant , and came back to the House where I lost my Money . The Landlady pretended she did not know the Prisoner , and so we made further Enquiry after her , and found her about an Hour afterwards in the Vinegar Fields , and 25 s. 6 d. upon her . I am certain I had my Purse when I went into the Prisoner 's Company , and as soon as she went out , I miss 'd it . - Bunch . I was Officer in this Affair .

The Prisoner told me his Name was Henry Miller , and that he kept the Paul's-Head in Spittle-Fields , and was ready to be bound for them . Upon that , I told him , if he would lend them the Money , I would give him my Note . He did not care for that he said , but if they wanted any thing in his Way , he would be very ready to let them have it . At last , after some Disputes , I lent them first three Pounds , and then 20 Shillings , and he wrote this Note , and sign 'd it in my Presence .

No , I was not acquainted with him , but trusted the Prisoner , thinking him to be the Man that kept the Paul's-Head , else I should not have lent him the Money . Mary Rodey .

When we had paid some of our Reckoning , we came out , and got on the Top of the Vestry-Room belonging to the Church , and cut the Lead : When we had got enough , we carried it Home to our own Lodging in Three-Fox-Court , in Long-lane by Smithfield . On Sunday in the Afternoon , we went to Mr. Wilks 's to drink , and while we were there , Mr. Boomer , and another Gentleman came to search the House . The next Morning we carried 109 Pounds of Lead to Wilks , - he keeps the George in Fleet-Lane , and I had been very well acquainted with the House before . When we came there with the Lead , we saw Wilks 's Wife and Daughter , and after we had been down in the Cellar to weigh it , we drank a Pint of hot Ale and Gin , and I then desir 'd Wilks to let us have the Money . He ask 'd me what Money I meant ? I told him I had brought in some Stuff , upon which he call 'd his Daughter Bitch , for not letting him know what we had brought . I call 'd him aside , and told him , we had five or six hundred Weight more , and desir 'd him no have it , except he could sell it , for it might be of dangerous Consequence . He ask 'd me , if we had cut it to Pieces ? I told him we had not , upon which he bid us go home and do it , and he would send his Daughter with a Porter to fetch it away , and he accordingly did . Q . How much did you receive from Wilks for the first Parcel ? Atkins . We received 1 s or 18 d. a piece then , and he us 'd to give us 9 s. 4 d. a hundred : it was agreed between us some Months before , that that should be a common Price for our Lead . C. What Place did you tell Wilks to send for it ? Atkins . We directed him to Three-Fox Court , and by his Order , his Daughter went home with us that she might find out the House again . Soon afterwards Wilks 's Daughter came with a Porter , and carried the Lead away to Mr. Ball 's a Plumber 's ; I know they went there with it , because the Prisoner Stedman took a turn or two with them , and he told me , they had lodg 'd it there , besides I myself had carried Lead there for Mr. Wilks , which we have stolen before this . I believe I could know the Lead again if I was to see it , but one Piece of Lead is like another ; we know it to be so by our Experience in cutting it . I work as a Plaisterer myself , and have known Wilks ten Months ; he keeps a Shop and buys Old Iron and Lead . Wilks 's Q . Suppose you had gone to a Plumber , how much should you have got for the Lead ? Atkins . Eleven Shillings a hundred or thereabouts : but any Thing of an honest Man would have examin 'd us about it : I never sold any to any Signification but to Wilks , and I ca n't say he knew this to be stolen . Q . When you told him you had got more Lead at Home , what did he say to you ? Atkins . He bid us go Home and cut it to pieces ; I suppose for Fear it should be match 'd ; but he gave us no Reason for his chusing to have it cut . Pris . Stedman . Ask him whose House the Lead was carry 'd to from the Vestry Room ? Atkins . To my Father 's in 3 Fox-court . Samuel Banister . I was employ 'd by Wilks to be his Porter to carry Goods out . I never carried any Lead to Ball 's before this misfortunate Time . He gave his Daughter Orders to go with me , and I went into 3 Fox-court and carry 'd some Lead from thence up Mr. Ball 's , the other Side of Leadenhall-market . I went 5 Times in all , two on the Monday , and three on Shrove Tuesday , and his Daughter went with me and saw the Lead weigh 'd . I ca n't justly say what the weight of it was , whether it was 5 or 600 weight , but I remember there were 6 lb . allow 'd for Dirt . C. When you were in 3 Fox-court , who gave you Directions to take the Lead away ? Banister . Old Atkins and a young Fellow with sore Eyes : My Master 's Daughter directed me where to carry it . He keeps a public House and buys and sells old Iron , and I never heard him accus 'd before . Wilks Q . Did you carry this Lead in a private manner as if it was stolen ? Banister . No , I carry 'd it in a Sack , and they help 'd me up with it . William Boomer , Constable ; gave an Account of his searching Wilks 's House , and that the Prisoners were there at the same Time ; that finding no Lead there , he gave over searching 'till Tuesday Night , when he receiv 'd Information that some of the Lead had been carry 'd to Mr. Ball 's : That he went thither and saw some pieces of Lead , and the Draught of them set down which amounted to 600 and odd weight , but he could not say that this was the Lead that came from the Vestry Room , and that afterwards he found the Prisoner Wilks 's Daughter there , who he apprehended came to receive the Money for what had been sold . Mrs. Ball . I bought some Lead of Wilks 's Daughter , and paid her 11 s. 6 d. a Hundred for it . William Duck . I have known Wilks upwards of 20 or 25 Years ; he has dealt in Tar and Grease , and has serv 'd People who kept Coaches and Carts . His usual Character has been that of a Bustling Man , striving to get his Bread . Thomas Pitch . I have known Wilks these 30 Years ; he was first a Bricklayer and then a Chairman ; since that , I have been at his Shop and seen Iron and Brass and such Things ; - I ca n't say I ever saw any Lead there . He has born the Character of an honest , laborious Man ever since I have known him . - Norcott . I have known Wilks the best part of these four Years ; he has dealt in Brokery ever since I have known him . He keeps a Shop , and his Scales us 'd to hang out at the Door : I have seen him buy and sell Iron and Lead as a fair Trader . I am a Wheeler and live in Thames-street ; I lay out a great many Pounds a Year in Grease with him . George Field Wheeler in Tyburn-road . Mr. Wilks liv 'd next Door to me for some Years : I have known him about 14 or 15 Years , but I have been little acquainted with him since he liv 'd this way , though I have dealt with him for Tar and Grease . I always thought him an honest Man , and from the Knowledge I have of him , I do n't belive he would buy stolen Goods . George Ludlow , Thomas Davis , George Fullick , Timothy Mitchel , John Tharm , and Richard Lewis , likewise appeared for Wilks , and never heard but that he bore a good Character . Thomas Jones . I keep a Shop in White-cross-street , and deal in old Iron , I have known Wilks , about 3 Years , and have dealt with him for a great many Pounds . His Character I know nothing of but that it is very fair . A Penny a Pound is a common Price for a Bit of Lead , and I have bought a great deal myself for 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred . - Beck . I ca n't say any thing as to his Character ; I have no Dealings with him . John Cole . I have known him 14 or 15 Years ; he liv 'd in my Neighbourhood in Tyburn road , but I know nothing of his particular Dealings . Ann Parfitt . I live in Fleet-lane , and did lodge at the Prisoner 's House : He buys old Iron and makes Grease , and I have known these Fellows use his House . He is not look 'd upon to be an honest Man in the Neighbourhood , for they say he bus stolen Goods ; that is his general Character . He kept his Scales below Stairs , and weigh 'd Lead there ; these Men have come all Hours of the Night to bring it . William Boomer . I have heard of Wilks 's buying stolen Goods continually , and have search 'd his House and all the rest of the Lane , but I never found any thing upon him . Wilks went with me and assisted me to take the Evidence Atkins . - Ford . I know Wilks very well , and he has the Character of buying stolen Goods . Stedman and Fidlin Guilty 4 s. 10 d Wilks Guilty .

Nicholas Falcon . I live in Black-Swan-Alley , near London Wall . On the 30th of March I went to Bed about Ten o'Clock , and next Morning I found my House broke open , and the Goods gone . Q . What Part of your House was broken ? Falcon . One of the Prisoners got over the Door-way , and unbolted the Yard Door , and let in the others ; after which they took a Pane of Glass out of the Kitchen Window , and so got in , and took my Goods . Q . Does your Kitchen Window open to the Street ? Falcon . No , it is backwards , but there are some Pales over the outer Door , about eight Feet high ; they got over these , and so came into the Yard . I left the Kitchen Window safe when I went to Bed , ( it was fasten 'd with a Hasp such as usually are in Casements ) but next Morning at 6 o'Clock , when I came down Stairs , I found it open . I had over Night providentially double lock 'd my Kitchen Door , so that they could not get any farther ; but the Shelves were clear 'd of the Pewter , and upon examining a little Closet in the Kitchen , I miss 'd the rest of the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment . On the Sunday following , I received Information that the Evidence Veisey was taken , and by his Directions I found some of my Goods at the Places where he and his Companions had pawn 'd them . John Veisey . The Night this Robbery was committed ; the two Prisoners and I met together at Mr. Bagley 's in Hartsborn-court ; he sells Gin , and we always used to meet there . Newton propos 'd going to this Man 's ( Falcon 's ) House , to take the Pewter , we staid at the Gin-shop 'till toward Eleven or Twelve o'Clock , and then went to this House . There is a Door in the Alley with some Pales over it like a Fence : I help 'd Newton over , and then he unbolted the Door and let us into the Yard . Then Newton broke some of the Panes of Glass with his Hand ; they were large Panes of Glass set in Lead . Cooley thought Newton did not do it fast enough , so he push 'd him away , and broke some of the Glass himself , and turn 'd the Bolt of the Window back . Newton went in first , and Cooley follow 'd him , and handed out the Goods to me : there were a small Copper Pot , and Cover , a large brass Pot , 2 Dishes , a Sauce-pan , a Stew-pan , and some Plates : Cooley and I did not know the House 'till Newton shew 'd it to us , we brought the Things from thence , and put them into an empty House 'till Morning , and then I pawn 'd a Copper Pot and one Dish at Mr. Trofeir 's somewhere by Clerkenwell , in Peter-street ; and the Stew-pan I pawn 'd at one Mrs. Davis 's up an Alley in Golden-lane . Cooley and I afterwards went to steal some Rabbits , and I being taken for that made this Information . Newton . Ask him over again . Veisey . We met together at Bagley 's in Harisborn-court , where Newton ask 'd us to go along with him , telling us he knew a House where we might get some Pewter . We went thither and I help 'd Newton over the Fence , and he unbolted the Door and let us in . Then he broke some Panes in the Casement , but Cooley thinking he did not break them fast enough , did the rest himself and so open 'd the Window . Newton went in first , Cooley follow 'd him , and handed out the Things to me . John Veisey , sen . The Evidence is my unfortunate Son . I was present when Newton was examin 'd by the Justice , and the Evidence 's Information was read over to him . When it was read that he got over the Prosecutor 's Pales , open 'd the Back door , and let in the other two , the Justice ask 'd him whether it was not so ? He said it was . Then it was read , - that Newton and Cooley broke the Window and open 'd the Casement ; and he said it was so . It was farther read that Newton and Cooley got in at the Window , and deliver 'd out the Prosecutor 's Goods to the Evidence , and being ask 'd whether that was right ? He said it was . He likewise confess 'd that there was a great Brass Pot that held 3 or 4 Pails of Water , which he sold to one Cartet , for four Shillings , and he told us where Catrer liv 'd , but I do n't remember that . Cooley was not before the Justice at that Time so I did not hear his Confession . Newton . Ask him over again . [ The Witness repeated his Evidence as above . ] William Garnet , Constable . I was before Justice Poulson when Newton was there , and Veisey 's Information was read over to him . I took them both , and they acknowledged every Thing according to the Information of the Accomplice . Q . When the Information was read over , were both the Prisoners present ? Garnet . No , one of them was taken on Sunday Morning , and the other afterwards . Veisey 's Father was before the Justice , when the Information was read to Newton , but I do n't remember seeing him when Cooley was there . Q . What Distance of Time was there between Newton and Cooley 's being before the Justice ? Garnet . I think I took Newton out of Bridewell on Sunday Morning , and on the Thursday or Friday following Cooley was taken . [ Part of the Goods were here produc 'd , and sworn to by the Prosecutor . ] Newton . I have got a poor Mother and 2 or 3 Neighbours to appear for my honesty . Cooley . I was coming along and a Man laid hold of me and carried me to Bridewell , and said Veisey ) had sworn House-breaking against me and Newton , but I am innocent . Elizabeth Newton . The Prisoner is my Son . I always was a very poor Woman , and took an honest Care to get Bread ; my Child did the same , when it was in his Power . I applied to Coleman-street Parish to put him Apprentice , or fit him for the Sea , but they would do nothing for him . Elizabeth Thomas . I have known Newton 5 or 6 Years . He us 'd the Markets , and has carried Fruit for me . I have trusted him with Money and Goods to the Value of 30 s at a Time , and do n't know that I ever lost a Pin by him . James Rose . I have known him 4 or 5 Years . I have trusted him to fetch and carry Goods for me , and never heard any Harm of him in the least . Mary Ward . I have known him 7 Years : I am a Neighbour to him : He always was very willing to work in any Sort of Business , and I never knew nothing but that he was honest . John Holder . I have known Cooley 8 or 9 Years : I take him to be about 14 or 15 Years old . His own Father is dead , but he lives with his Mother , who has marry 'd a second Husband . He is a Copper Smith , and works at Home . As to the Boy , I never heard any Harm of him , nor ever knew that he wrong 'd any Body . Elizabeth Delacourt I knew Cooley before he could run alone : I live next Door to his Mother , and do n't know that he ever was from her . She us 'd to send him to School , but since she married a second Husband , he has been upon liking with his Father . Mary Chum . I liv 'd next Door to the Prisoner , and I know nothing but that he took a very good Course . He us 'd to clean the Brasses for his Father-in-law Elizabeth Johnson . Cooley is my Son : He has had a good Education in reading and writing , and what I could afford to give him . He always staid within Doors , but sometimes he has been drawn away , and once I found him at a Place where the Evidence Veisey brought him to . Elizabeth Pye , Eleazar Gibbons , and Matthew Moore , likewise appear 'd to Cooley 's Character . Both guilty Death . 32. James Page , was indicted for assaulting Daniel Bean ( with another Person unknown ) in a certain Street , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 13 d. in Money , March 14 Daniel Bean On the 14th of March last I had been into Spittle Fields , and between One and Two in the Morning as I was returning Home through Cheapside , near the Half-moon Tavern , I stood up to make Water , and then the Prisoner and another Man in his Company , stopp 'd me as I turn 'd about to go Home . The Prisoner hit me a Blow with his double Fist , right against my Heart , and knock 'd out my Breath for sometime . Then the other Man knock 'd me down with a short Staff , or Truncheon , and the Prisoner put his Hand into my Pocket , and took out what little Money I had , which amounted to 13 or 14 d. or something more . After this , they beat me most terribly as I lay down , - they did not tell me what was their Reason for it . When they had us 'd me in this Manner , they made off , upon which I call 'd Watch ! and then they turned back , and knock 'd me down again , and left me bleeding . They beat this Eye out , so that I shall never see out of it , and I spit Blood for two Days . I know very well that the Prisoner was one of them , because he stoop 'd down towards me ; besides it was a Moon-light Morning , and there are 4 or 5 large Lamps just by ; there was nobody with me but my Boy . Pris . Please to enquire into his Character . Bean . I am a Silk Weaver , and live in Baldwin 's Gardens , by Leather lane , at the Sign of the Cradle My Wife is a Midwife , and I have work 'd for Mr. Jackson , at the Golden-Head in Moorfields , these 17 Years . William Attley . I have nothing to say against the Prisoner , no farther then that I took him just by St. Andrew 's Church in Holborn ; there were 4 or 5 Thieves with him . I ca n't say what Time it was exactly ; but I believe it was about a Fortnight or three Weeks ago ; Bean was with me , and as soon as he saw the Prisoner , he said that was the very Man . Timothy Bean , 13 Years old last Michaelmas , being examin 'd as to his Knowledge of the Nature of an Oath , was admonished to speak the Truth , and gave the following Evidence . That is the Man who came up to my Father first , and the other Man who was along with him , knock 'd my Father down : I remember it was the 14th of March , because my Father set it down , but I ca n't tell the Day of the Week . My Father and I went to see for some Money , and coming Home , the Prisoner made up to him just by the Half moon Tavern in Cheapside , and struck him on the Stomach , and the other knock 'd him down with a short Staff . Then they stood over him , and threaten 'd his Life , if he made a Noise , and he said they had taken 13 or 14 d. from him , I ca n't tell which . Q . Did they do any Thing to him while he was down ? Bean . No , they did not strike him ; they only stood swearing over him . My Father made shift to get up , and when he call 'd the Watch , they came back , and knock 'd him down again , and then made off . Q . How do you know that the Prisoner was one of the Men that robb 'd your Father ? Bean . Because I have seen him three Times ; twice when he knock 'd my Father down , and once since that , by Honey lane Market . Pris . I was standing at St. Andrew 's Church , and Attley the Thief-catcher gave a young Man a Half-penny to get some Tobacco , and I ask 'd him for a Bit of it . Then I went to Field lane , to get a Sheep's-Head for my Supper , and he came there after me , and took me . Wm Doleman . I heard a Man ask the Prosecutor 's Son whether his Father had sworn to the Prisoner ; and he said , no , - he could not be sure . I am a Salesman at the Red cross in Chick-lane . John Raymond . All that I have to say is , that about three Weeks or a Month ago last Friday , I happen 'd to hear that a Man was taken up for this Robbery , and seeing the Prosecutor 's little Boy go by , I ask 'd him if his Father knew the Man ? He said , no , his Father could not be sure . Attley This Man shaves all the Thieves in Thatch'd-Alley , and his Mother keeps a Brandy-Shop . Raymond . I live in Chick-lane , and am a Barber and Peruke-maker , I know the Prosecutor very well ; he always pass 'd for a very honest Man , and I have shav 'd him a great many Times . Edward Craft . I have known the Prisoner 5 or 6 Years ; I never knew no harm of him in my Life : He runs on Errands , cleans Shoes , or does any Thing in an honest Way . He has no settled Lodging , but lives at any Place he can pay for . I never heard but that he bore a good Character , and I bless God my Character is unstain 'd if you please to examine into it . Out of good Will to the Prisoner ( who I believe is as innocent as I am , and I desie the World to say otherwise of me ) I took an Opportunity to examine the Prosecutor 's Character through his Neighbourhood , and every House-Keeper gave him a very bad Character . Maary Craft . I am related to the former Witness , and live in Beach-lane . I have known the Prisoner ever since he was a little Boy , and never heard any Harm of him ; but was always willing to do any Thing in an honest Way for a Bit of Victuals . Jane Scot . I have known him and his Family a great many Years . His Father was a Porter , and carried a Basket in the Market . I have reliev 'd him with a hard Crust , and he was very thankful for it . I never heard that he was a Thief , but always believ 'd him to be very honest . Rebecca Bristol . I have known all his Family a great many Years , and always took him for a harmless young Man . I liv 'd 24 Years in one House , and I am almost forty Years of Age . Joseph Green . I have known him between 3 and 4 Years , and for the general Part , or altogether , he always was an honest , endeavouring Man , willing to get a Penny in an honest , tho ' a mean Way . But I have one Thing more to say , - the Prosecutor , since the Company have been here , said to this Man , you Rogue you have said what you ca n't answer , and I will do for you when I get out of Court . Q. to Timothy Bean . Did you tell Raymond that your Father could not swear to the Prisoner ? Bean . No , he never ask 'd me that . Acquitted . 33.

I John Thompson , of the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , in the County of Middlesex , Mariner , being in bodily Health , and of sound and disposing Mind and Memory , considering the Perils and Danger of the Seas , and Uncertainties of this transitory Life , do , for avoiding Controversies after my Decease , publish and declare this my last Will and Testament . in Manner and Form following .

In the 15th Year of His MAJESTY 'S Reign . NUMBER IV . Part II . for the YEAR 1742 . BEING THE Fourth SESSIONS in the MAYORALTY OF THE Right Honble Sir Robert Godschall , Knt . LORD-MAYOR of the CITY of LONDON . LONDON : Printed and Sold by T. PAYNE , in Bishopsgate-Street , near the South-Sea-House . M , DCC.XLII . Where may be had any of the former Numbers in this Mayoralty . ( Price SIX-PENCE . ) THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE Sessions of the Peace , Oyer and Terminer , For the CITY of LONDON , & c. THE Councel for the King having opened the Indictment , proceeded to take Notice that this Prosecution was founded on a late Act of Parliament , which was made to punish those who were guilty of a Crime of the first Magnitude , destructive to Trade , and all that Security which every one ought to have for their Estate and Property : That the Pers on mention 'd in the Indictment by the Name of John Thompson , was originally a Taylor , but that in March 1737 , he enter 'd on board his Majesty 's Ship the Flamborough : that being indebted to one Carter in the Sum of 14 l. and being going on board the Ship , he gave a Letter of Attorney to this Carter , to receive his Wages : that he likewise made a Will , wherein he appointed Carter his general Legatee , and that he afterwards died on board this Vessel in August thirty-nine . Carter hearing of Thompson 's Decease , applyed to Doctor 's Commons to prove the Will that was left with him : that upon his coming there , he found that another Will had been proved , which was the Will in Question , and wherein Thompson was said to have appointed the Prisoner his Legatee , who must ( in order to have been entitled to receive a Probate ) have taken an Oath that that was the true Will of John Thompson . That , as soon as Carter found this Fraud had been committed , he made what search he could to find out this Rhodes , and at last received Information of him at Mitchell 's Coffee-House near the Navy-Office , and he was afterwards taken up for this Fact . It was farther observed , that it was a great Misfortune attending this Sort of Men , that they are not only subject to greater Casualties than other People , but also leave their Effects under great Uncertainty ; that upon the Probate of a Will 's being produc 'd , the proper Officer of the Navy is bound to deliver a Ticket for the Wages of the Sailor to that Person who appears to be entitled to it , and that it has been too much a Practice lately for Persons to set up Wills which never were real , to get into their Custody , that Pay which these honest Men have earn 'd with the Sacrifice of their Lives , & c. Counc . We shall call Mr. Roseindale to prove the Death of John Thompson . Mr. Roseindale . I am chief Clerk of the Ticket Office in the Navy-Office ; this in my Hand is the Muster Book of the Ship Flamborough . The Captains of the Men of War are enjoin 'd as convenient Opportunity offers , to send their Muster-Books and Tickets as frequently as possible to the Navy-Office , and we endorse and enter them into such a Book as this , and they are assign 'd once or twice in a Month to the Executors . Counc . Have you not there the Names of all the Persons on board the Fleet ? Mr. Roseindale . Yes , all that are living , dead and run away . Counc . If any body dies on board , does not that Book take Notice of it ? Mr. Roseindale . Yes , and it appears by this , that John Thompson , an able Seaman , died the 22d of August , 1739 , at Turtle Bay , on board the Flamborough , and the Ticket was made out for his Wages , and sent to the Navy-Office . Jury . When was the Ticket made out ? Mr. Roseindale . I presume , presently after the Man died . It was here urg 'd by the Council for the Prisoner , that this was improper Evidence to be laid before the Jury , and not sufficient to prove Thompson 's Death ; that a Fact of this Kind should be prov 'd by Persons who were on board the Ship , for that the Captain or other Officers of the Ship might through Mistake or Design , return the Man dead when he was really alive . In answer to which , the Councel for the Prosecution said they were surpriz 'd to hear this Objection made ; for that according to the known Course of the Navy , the Names of all the Sailors that die , are regularly enter 'd in a Book for that Purpose ; that this Book was given in Evidence in December last in the Case of Fitzgerald and Lee ; the Evidence of Perry 's Death being only a Book of this Kind . That the Person who dies is always enter 'd in this Book , and when it comes over here , the Consequence of that is , there is a Ticket made out for the Wages , and according to the known Course of the Navy , deliver 'd to the Person who brings the Probate : That as the Prisoner stood indicted for publishing a Will , it was an Acknowledgment by himself that the Party was dead , unless he could go and swear he was dead , and prove his Will , when he is alive : That the Prisoner had actually receiv 'd the Pay of that Man , and therefore he thought him dead or certainly he would not have gone to Doctor's-Commons to prove the Will ; that if this was not Evidence to prove his Death , no Seaman could be secure of one Shilling which he was venturing his Life for every Hour he lives , & c. By the Prisoner 's Councel in Reply it was offer 'd that there were a great many People on board the Ship who best knew whether the Man was alive or no , and that the Proof ought to be fuller in this than in other Cases ; that notwithstanding the Prisoner might have prov 'd this Will , that was not sufficient ; for that a great many People had prov 'd Wills , when it has appear 'd that the Person was alive . It was farther observed by the Councel on the same side that there was no such Thing as a Will while a Man was alive , for that he might controul it every Moment : That no Person appear 'd here , upon the true Survey of the Ship to prove this Man dead , and therefore 't was hop 'd that what had been offer 'd against the Prisoner , was not sufficient Evidence of the Death of a Man in a Case of Felony . Upon the Whole , the Court were of Opinion that the Councel for the Prosecution should go on with their Evidence . Counc . Did you make out any Ticket for Wages due to John Thompson ? Roseindale . No Sir , it was made out by the Captain of the Ship . I deliver 'd it out of the Office to Robert Rhodes , Executor , a Cheese-monger , at the Corner of King-street , St. Giles 's I ca n't say I know his Face , by reason I see so many People coming backwards and forwards . Pris . Q . When did you deliver out the Ticket ? Roseindale . This is the Ticket ; I deliver 'd it to Mr. Rhodes , Sept. 3 , 1741. John Goodwin . This in my Hand is an original Will . Counc . Who deliver 'd it to you ? Goodwin . I had it in my own Custody , as being Clerk to the Register in the Prerogative Office . Joseph Hughes . This Will was brought to me by the Prisoner , in order to his proving it . Counc . Did you go with him to prove it ? Hughes . I wrote the Oath on the back of it , and went with him before Doctor Chapman to get him Sworn to it , and he did Swear to it . Here is a Copy of the Oath on the back of it ; I dated it the 3d , of September 1741 . I have seen the Prisoner before this , and since , for he has been to me , with People upon other Occasions . Dr. Robert Chapman . This is my Name on the back of the Will . Counc . What was the Oath that was administer 'd to the Prisoner ? Dr. Robert Chapman . The Oath he swore was , that he believ 'd this to be the last Will and Testament of John Thompson , deceas 'd ; that he was nam 'd Executor , and that he would give a just Account of his Executorship when call 'd to it by Law . This is only a short Jurat on the Back of the Will . He swore that this was the Will of John Thompson , deceased , and the rest was a Promissary Oath that he would duly pay the Debts and Legacies ; and here is likewise wrote on the Back , that the Effects do n't amount to 20 l. Mr. Hughes . They bring the Will first , and the Jurat is wrote on the Back ; then we carry them to a Doctor to be sworn , and this Will was prov 'd according to the Prisoner 's Directions . Q . Did you go with the Prisoner ? Hughes . Yes , I went with him myself . [ The Will was read . ] Counc . We shall now call Samuel Boyden to prove that this is not the Will of John Thompson , and that he was not a Mariner , nor of this Parish at the Time the Will bears Date ; - Are you acquainted with the Hand-writing of John Thompson ? Boyden . I was so far acquainted with it , that I took particular Notice of his signing the Will to Mr. Carter , and to the best of my Knowledge this is not his Hand . Pris . Q . Did you never see him write but that Time that he sign 'd the other Will which you witness 'd ? Boyden . I have seen his Writing , but never was by when he wrote : except when he made that Will which I witness 'd . - I ca n't remember when that was . Counc . I ask you whether in September 1736 , he was a Mariner ? Boyden . No , he was not , he was a Taylor , and liv 'd in the Parish of St. Mary le Strand . Counc . I ask you whether he did , or did not live in St. Giles 's Parish . Boyden . Not to my Knowledge ; I never heard that he liv 'd there . Q . Where did he live when you saw him make the Will ? Boyden . In White hart yard , in the Parish of St. Mary le Strand . Q . Where did he live when that Will was made in 1736 . Boyden I do n't know ; he came out of Yorkshire as near as I can judge , about two Years before he went to Sea , and I sign 'd that Will for Mr. Carter the Night before Thompson went on board . Pris . Q . What Day did you sign the Will for Carter ? Boyden . It is impossible for me to remember that ; I know the Time ; but I ca n't remember the Day or the Year . John Gibson I was acquainted with John Thompson in his Life Time . I ca n't say I ever saw his Writing before he sign 'd a Will to which I was a Witness ; - the Will that he made to Carter . Counc . What Time was that ? Gibson . I believe in 37 or thereabouts ; it was a little after the Queen 's Mourning ; - he was a Servant to me then as a Taylor . Counc . Was he a Seaman at that Time ? Gibson . No , nor never had been a Seaman before . Counc . Look at that Hand-writing there . Gibson . It is nothing like his Hand . I saw both the Wills before Mr. Deveil , and that which I witness 'd I can swear was his Hand-writing , but this is not . Pris . Q Did you ever see him write since that ? Gibson . Yes , once at my own House ; it was his Name to a Note of Hand : This Will is dated March 7 , 1737. this is my Hand , and I saw Thompson write that at the Time it bears Date . Pris . How long after that Will was made did you see him write his Name to the Note . Gibson . The same Day . Boyden . This Will is Mr. Thompson 's Hand ; I sat by him when he wrote it , and look 'd particularly at it ; I am a subscribing Witness to it , and it is not like the pretended Will at all . Mr. Carter being call 'd by the Councel for the Prosecution , it was urg 'd on Behalf of the Prisoner that he was a Person interested , and therefore could not be admitted to give Evidence ; that this was the same as a Case of a Note of Hand , where the Party who is bound by that Note comes to prove it forg 'd , to secure his own Interest . In answer to which , it was said , that the Consequence of this Suit could in no shape affect Carter , the other Will being already prov 'd in the proper Court , and supposing the Will which the Prisoner stood indicted for should really prove a good one , yet Carter 's Will being subsequent would destroy it . The Prisoner 's Will bearing Date in the Year 36 , and Carter 's 37 , making it indisputable : That this was not a private Prosecution , but a Prosecution in the Name of the Crown for the Benefit of the Public , that the Prisoner might be punish 'd according to Law , therefore exactly agreeable to a common Case of Felony . It was observed by the Prisoner 's Councel in Reply that this was no Answer to the Objection ; that Carter ( who had a Will ) was called to prove which was the real one , the 1st , or the last ; that he was call 'd to prove the Prisoner 's Will false , and certainly he must have Benefit by that , for that then his own would stand without doubt . The Court being of Opinion that Carter was not a competent Witness , the Councel proceeded to call Sarah Russel . Counc . Do you know the Prisoner ? Mrs. Russel . Yes Sir ; I purchas 'd this Ticket of him , I think it was the fourth of September last : it was the very Day after the Ticket was delivered out of the Office . Counc . Had you any Meeting with the Prisoner in relation to this Affair Russel . He us 'd to call very often at my House and drink a Glass of Wine . Counc . What did he say upon this Occasion ? Russel . He shew 'd me the Ticket , and ask 'd me to buy it : I said I would if it was a good one : I sent over to the Office and had it cast with the Books , and paid him the Money for it . Counc Did you ever see him with Carter ? Russel . Yes , I believe I have : I heard him say to Carter , if he could prove his Will to be good , he would make any just Agreement with him , for they both said that Thompson ow 'd them Money . Pris . Q . How long have you known me ? Russel . I ca n't remember ; I do n't take such Notice of Strangers , but I believe I may say a Year . Pris Q . What do you take me to be ? Russel . A Man ; I suppose . Pris Q . Do you suppose me to be a good Man . Russel . I do n't suppose any Thing at all ar . Pris Ask her whether she never heard of Sailors making three or four Wills to defraud different People of Sums of Money ? Russel I have heard People talk so to be sure , but I never had any Proof of it . Mr. Goodwin . Sometimes I have 2 or 3 Wills from different Persons , and when we meet with any , we stop them . Pris Q . Did you never hear of a third Will of Thompson coming to your Office ? Mr. Goodwin . No , I never heard of it . Barnabas Honeychurch . I knew John Thompson , I was very well acquainted with him . Counc . Did you ever see him write ? Honeychurch . No Sir , I was acquainted with him within a few Days after he came to London , which I take to be about 7 or 8 Years ago : He was a Taylor , and liv 'd at the Swan and Apple-Tree in White-Hart-Yard , in the Parish of St. Mary le Strand . Counc . Did you ever know him live in St. Giles 's ? Honeychurch . No , never . I remember when he first went to Sea ; it was about four Years ago last January , in the Year thirty-seven . He never was a Seaman before that , by what I have heard him say , and he work 'd with me within a Day or two before he went to Sea . He has apply 'd to several People who had been at Sea to inform him about the Business , for he was going Taylor to Captain Pierce of the Flamborough . He din 'd with me almost every Day in the Week , and frequently supp 'd with me except his Business call 'd him another Way . Pris . Q . Do not these Parishes join ? Honeychurch . No , St. Martin 's Parish crosses them . St. Giles 's is above Long-Acre . Here the Ticket was read , - `` John Thompson , `` able Seaman , aged ( Blank ) Years , died on `` board the Flamborough Man of War , Aug. 22 , `` 1739 , at which Time he was discharged by `` Reason of Death . '' 19 l. 18 s. 1 d. DEFENCE . If your Lordship pleases , I can call one Man who was in the House when the Will was made to me . Call Robert Nash Jones . Pris . Q . Did you know Mr. Thompson that is dead ? Jones . Yes , his Name was John Thompson , I knew him no farther than just happening into the Alehouse where the Will was making , and that was in Church-Court , by St. Martin's-Church , and I think it was at the Chequer Alehouse . I went in to drink a Pint of Beer , and there was Mr. Rhodes . I knew him when he liv 'd at the Seven-Dials some Years ago , and for that Reason he spoke to me . At that Time the Will was making , it was fill 'd up by one John Williams , but I did not see it witness 'd . Pris . Q . Was there any Thing desired by Thompson or Rhodes at that Time ? Jones . Nine Pounds Mr. Rhodes disbursted at that Time to Thompson , as I understood , it was to sit him out , or something in that Way , and Thompson was to make a Will to him , and he was to receive his Pay ; according to my Understanding it was so . Pris Q . How long ago was this ? Jones . I take it to be about Michaelmas Time in 36 or 37 ; I was there present , and paid my Reckoning , and went away and left them together Counc . Where do you live ? Jones . At the Back of St. Clement 's ; sometimes I work in Coals , and sometimes in the Plumbers Way as a Porter ; I have work 'd at Mr. Thomas 's Wharf at Dowgate , and for Mr. Wardell and Colwell the Bottom of Dowgate hill , and sometimes I have been in a Branch of Leather-dressing . Counc . Who did you live with last in the Plumber 's Way ? Jones . Mr. Deval in Piccadilly ; he has one Shop in Holborn , and another in Piccadilly : I have not been at Work that Way since three Months before Christmas . Counc . Have you never work 'd in the Plumber 's Way since then ? Jones . I ca n't be particular to a Day : I have not work 'd with any body since , as a Plumber , but I have been employ 'd by Mr. Jones in Clement's-lane , who is what we call a Leather-dresser . I have work 'd for him 2 Months since Christmas . Counc . How long did you work for him ? Jones . Ten Weeks or two Months perhaps , as near as I can remember : the last time I work 'd for him was about 2 Months ago : I came from Mr. Deval 's , and went to Mr. Jones 's , and work 'd for him 3 Months before Christmas : I ca n't tell when I work 'd last for Mr. Jones , for I had no Occasion to take Notice of the Day . Counc . Did you work with him all the Time , from the Time that you first began with him ? Jones . Yes , till just now . Counc . How long had you been acquainted with John Thompson ? Jones . Only the Time of the Will 's making : I do n't know that I have seen him before or since . Counc . How do you know it was John Thompson ? Jones . Because the Man that fill 'd up the Will call 'd him so . Counc . Was this in the Year 38 . Jones . No , I take it to be about 36 or 37 : I ca n't justly say to an Hour , a Day , or a Month , because I only chanc 'd ( to go ) in for a Pint of Beer , and I sat down in the Company . Counc . Did you read the Will ? Jones No , I am not Scholar enough I believe to read a Will . Counc Who told you it was a Will ? Jones . I understood according to my Understanding , that the Will was made to Mr. Rhodes on disbursting so much Money . Counc . Who told you this was Thompson 's Will ? Jones . Mr. Thompson and John Williams were together , and I saw him writing on the Paper : - I staid there half an Hour or better . I saw nobody else there but Thompson , Williams and Mr. Rhodes Counc . Did you see the Will sign 'd ? Jones . No , I only saw John Williams ( as Mr. Thompson call 'd him ) writing on the Paper : I saw nothing at all sign 'd . I can read a little , but I did not read the Will , for I had no Concerns to ask any Questions . Counc . Do you know Mary Sempson ? Jones . No , nor I did not know John Williams , only hearing Thompson call him by his Name . Counc . What sort of a Man was this Thompson ? Jones . He was a long visag 'd Man , not so thick as I am : I take him to be a blackish swarthy Man : I ca n't say whether he wore his own Hair or a Wig , because I had no Occasion to take Notice . Counc . How do you know this was John Thompson ? Jones . Williams call 'd him by his Name . Counc . About what Age did Thompson seem to be ? Jones . About thirty : I ca n't guess at a Man 's Age so long ago . Counc . Did he wear a Wig or his own Hair ? Jones I ca n't tell . A Witness . This Will was brought to me by Rhodes . He likewise brought another Will of Thompson 's which I have in my Pocket ; I think it is made to Mary Vaughan . Thompson 's Will being prov 'd , a Citation was taken out against Rhodes to bring it in , and shew Cause why a Will of a later Date should not be prov 'd . Sometime after that , the Prisoner said he had found out a Will of a later Date than the other . I look 'd upon it , and told him , he must bring his Witnesses if he intended to support it . He said , he knew but little of that Affair ; but that one Mrs. Glass could inform me farther of it . He left me the Will and the Letter in which it was inclos 'd , and I went to Mrs. Glass , who told me , she had received that Will enclos 'd in the Letter from Mrs. Vaughan at Portsmouth , and desir 'd every Thing might be done that was necessary to support it ; but Rhodes 's Wil l never was prov 'd by Testes , therefore it was revok 'd , and the other granted . James Cockran I have known Rhodes between 7 and 8 Months coming and going ; I never saw any thing by the Gentleman but Honesty . He has gone in my Parish under the Character of an honest Man , and it is more than I know if he would do such a Thing as this . I use the Holland Trade , and have sold him Stockings and Linnen , and have trusted him for a Month together . He is a Cheesemonger , and lives at t'other End of the Town . I have liv 'd in St. Katherine 's Parish these 9 Years , and he us 'd to call upon me at my Chandler 's Shop , and paid for what he wanted . Peter Glass . I have known him 8 or 9 Months : I keep a Barber 's Shop on Tower-hill : He always paid me 6 d. a Time , and I never saw nothing but what was honest and just by him . - Harper . I have known him these 2 or 3 Years : He has been gone out of the Neighbourhood 4 or 5 Months , and then he bore a good Character : He used me handsome , and paid me for what he had : I liv 'd over-against him . Pris Q . Have you any Suspicion that I would do so soul a Crime as I am accused of ? Harper . The Man behav 'd very well . Counc . What Character did other People give him ? Harper . I have heard People whispering about that he was concern 'd in these Wills 5 or 6 Months ago ; the first Occasion of it was some Papers from the Commons being hung up at his Door before Christmas . Counc . Was that on Account of this Will or another ? Harper . I never heard of any Will but this : He was a Cheesemonger in King-street , by the Seven Dials . John Hastings . I have known the Prisoner about ten or a dozen Years . He liv 'd in Little St. Andrew-street , near the Seven-Dials , and from thence he mov 'd to the Corner of Earl-Street , in King-street . When he liv 'd in St. Andrew-Street , he behav 'd very well , and was respected by the Neighbourhood , and was a very industrious Man ; but when he mov 'd into Earl-street , he became a Headborough , which a great many People believe was of no Service to him , for he has been accus 'd of a great many foolish Things not to his Credit , with regard to Thief-taking , which is not a creditable Thing for a House-keeper . By following these Practices , his Business was reduc 'd to such a low Ebb , that at last I believe he was driven to his Shifts ; and there was something stuck up against one of his Window-Shutters , but what it was I ca n't tell . His Character is really a very bad one . Pris . Did you ever hear that I wrong 'd any one in the Neighbourhood of a Farthing ? Hastings . I know nothing no farther than there was something stuck upon his Window-Shutter about a Will , something above 3 Months ago . Henry Brows . I have known the Prisoner 2 or 3 Years ; I liv 'd directly over-against him when he liv 'd in King street . When he came into the Neighbourhood , we took him to be a very honest Man which was about two Years ago ; but since that , he was a Headborough , and hang 'd two Men , which got him a bad Character . His general Character at first was very Honest ; but by being guilty of these Facts , we could not think any other Thing but what was bad . Wm Nichols . The Prisoner liv 'd over against me , and his Character at first was very good , but lately very indifferent ; for there was something stuck up against his House , and there was a Talk of his forging a Will . Thomas Trout . I have known him about 2 or 3 Months , and his general Character is very bad , in forging Notes and Wills : it came once to my turn to arrest him , about 3 or 4 Months ago : I never heard a bad Character of him before that Time for I never knew him . Pris . Ask him how I behav 'd when he arrested me ? Trout . I took his Word , and one Mr. Young paid me the Debt and Costs in 2 Days . Walter Burton . I have known the Prisoner above three Months , and by an intimate Acquaintance of his , one John Jones a Leather-dresser , I have heard a very bad Character of him . Pris . I arrested this Man for a Note of Hand for 26 l. and he has mov 'd the Cause out of the Marshalsea into the Court of King's-Bench or Common Pleas . Burton . It was a forg 'd Note , and therefore I would not pay it : I never gave a Note of Hand in my Life . - Spradley . I never saw the Prisoner till the 30th of Sept. last , but since I have had the Occasion to know him , he has borne a very bad Character . Francis Jordan . I have known him a pretty while , and dealt with him , and he then bore a good Character , but since I have heard an indifferent one : he bore a good Character in the Neighbourhood , and when I was Overseer he paid me my Taxes last Year . Counc . What Character has he borne since ? Jordan . I wo n't go by Hearsay ; I will swear nothing but what I can prove . Guilty . Death . 39.

He was likewise charged by Virtue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . The Witnesses were examined a-part . John Jones . I saw the black Man standing in Shorter-street , by Well-close-square : His Name was Henry Oliver . There came a Press-Gang to take a Woman that had pick 'd a Man 's Pocket , and they found her , and took her to the Watch-House . The Prisoner came by with a great Stick in his Hand like a Broom-stick , and a Knife or Dagger in the other . The Press-Gang pushed him down in the Middle of the Highway , and left him : Then he got up again , and stood talking to the black Man : I heard the Black say something to him that the Woman ought to be hang 'd for picking the Gentleman 's Pocket , and the Prisoner immediately gave him a Punch with something that he had in his Hand ; I ca n't tell whether it was a Knife or a Dagger , but I am sure the Black did nothing at all to him . The Prisoner struck him in the Face , and then gave him another Knock with the same Instrument , and the Black fell down in the Highway directly , and never spoke afterwards . Then the Prisoner ran away into the Ship Alehouse , and was lost for half an Hour before we could hear any Thing of him ; but we went into a Gentleman 's Yard , and saw him getting over the Pales : He hid himself under a Bench in an Arbour , and we pulled him out from thence , and told him he had killed the Black : He said , he hop 'd he had not , and then we took him to the Watch-House . Pris . Ask him whether the black Man was not bleeding over the Eye before I came to the Place ? Jones . I believe the black Woman gave him a little Scratch : They were scolding together , and the Woman gave him a little Push , and scratched him over the Eye ; but it did not bleed . Stephen Jones . I was coming Home with my Brother on Sunday Night , and in Shorter-Street there was a black Man and a black Woman fighting ; presently a Press-Gang came by , and went into a House by the Hay Field , and took a Woman out who had picked the Captain 's Pocket . Coming through Shorter-Street again , I saw the Black go through the Square with the Press-Gang , and he stood by while they put the Woman into the Watch-House : The Prisoner was there at the same Time , and the Black said something that the Woman deserved to be hang 'd , or some such Thing : Upon which the Prisoner gave him a Push with something that look 'd like one of your snick or snee Knives : He gave him another Push , and he fell on his Back , and never spoke afterwards : The first Blow was on the right Eye , and the second on the right Shoulder . As soon as this was done , we cry 'd out , The Fellow has kill 'd the Black ! Upon which the Prisoner run away , and got into an Arbour in a Garden , from whence he was taken . Q . Where did you see him do this ? Jones . In the Highway , just by the Watch-House : He ran down with the Knife ready drawn , and a Club in his Hand , but the Press-Gang took the Club from him . William Hopkins . I was smoaking my Pipe , and just going to Bed , when these People came by the Door : I went to the Door , and hearing that a Woman was taken by a Press-Gang , I followed them 8 or 9 Rods : The Prisoner and the Black came up ; the Black stood a little Distance off , and I stood in the Middle of the Road : The Prisoner had a Stick at his Side , and one of the Sailors took it from him ; upon which he seem 'd to grumble , and then the Sailor knocked him down , and went off . After this three or four People being talking about this Affair , the Black said , the Woman was a Whore , and ought to be hang 'd : The Prisoner went to him directly , and gave him a Push in the Face , which made him reel , and as he was falling , gave him another Stab on the Shoulder : I believe the Prisoner did it with a Knife , for his Stick was taken away . When this was done , the Prisoner jump 'd upon him , or over him , I ca n't tell which , and run away ; but he was afterwards taken from under a Bench in a Summer-House belonging to a Garden : We told him he had killed the Black , and he said he knew nothing of it ; but there was some fresh Blood upon his Shirt . Pris . Ask him , whether one of the Press-Gang did not make my Nose bloody ? Hopkins . No : He was only knock 'd down , but that was a good while before . Q . Did you see what the Prisoner gave the Push with ? Hopkins . Yes ; it was a Weapon with a very long Blade . Francis Mitchel . I had been at my Mother 's , and coming back , I saw a Parcel of People : There was a black Man and a black Woman came by , and they fell to fighting , and the Woman cut his Eye or his Face : After that the Press Gang came by to look for the Woman , and the Black went with them : They got the Woman , and presently afterwards the Black came by again ; and , to the best of my Knowledge , the Prisoner struck him on the Shoulder , and made him reel : Then he struck him on the Eye , and he fell at his Length , and cry 'd Murder . The Prisoner run into an Alehouse ; - I believe it was a Knife that he struck him with , and I did not see the Black do any Thing to him . Jury . Did the Woman strike the Black on the same Eye as the Prisoner did ? Mitchel . The Woman cut him some where about the Face . Thomas Thompson . I was at the taking of the Prisoner , and did not find any Thing at all upon him . I did not see what was done in the Highway . Gould Cole , Surgeon . I searched this Negroe 's Wounds two Days after he died ; one was a small incis 'd Wound on the Top of the deltui 'd Muscle , about half an Inch long , and an Inch deep ; there was another small Wound on the Frontis , which is the Forehead ; and another , which was a perquilated Wound , above the right Eye , ( into the Socket which contains the Eye ) about four Inches and an half deep , and an Inch long : The Wound in his Eye was certainly the Cause of his Death , for that in his Shoulder was of no Signification . Q . Were there any Parts of his Face scratched ? Cole . I did not observe any : This Wound in the Eye I take it , was given by some sharp Instrument , like a Sword or Dagger ; and that on the Forehead , was a little small Wound like a Scratch . DEFENCE . Jane Wall . Another Woman and I went into Mr. Allen 's to call for a Pint of Two penny : The Black came in after us , and said , he had been there some Time of the Day , and spent three half Crowns in Punch , and had lost some Money in the House by some of the Women : He made a Noise in the House , and said he would not go till he had got his Money . There was a Lad along with him , who said he had lost a Shilling ; and the Gentleman of the House turned them , and some of the Women out of Doors . In a little Time the Black came back again , all over Blood : - This was about 7 o'Clock at Night . Hopkins . The Fact was done about half an Hour after 9 , or thereabouts . Wall . He came in , and stood against the Partition ; and the Blood run down to his Temple . Jury . Did you look in his Face then ? Wall . Yes , and the Blood run down all over his Shirt . Jury to the Surgeon . Did the Wound in the Eye disfigure the Negro 's Face ? Cole . It went quite through the Eye-Lash ; but that in the Forehead might bleed a little . Wall . The Blood that I saw , proceeded from this Place . [ Pointing to her Forehead . ] I desired him to go Home , for fear of being used ill ; and he said he would lose more Blood , before he would go Home without his Money . Hester Cole . This Woman and I were in the Alehouse when the Black came in : He said he had been ill used , and robbed in the House , and he would have his Money . There were two Women , one black and the other white : And the People of the House bid him get out , but he refused ; and so they shut him and the Women out in the Entry : They all came in again in a few Minutes , and then I saw the Blood run down his Shirt on the right Side : This was about Seven o'Clock at Night , and next Morning I heard he was murdered .

John Portman . The Prisoner I do believe to be the Person that shot and wounded Isaac Crawley on the 4th of April in the Morning , at the Bottom of Clerkenwell-Green . He was afterwards taken to St. Bartholmew 's Hospital , and died there . C. Now tell us all the Circumstances of the Case in the Manner they happened . Portman . I am Constable , and was coming from the Watch-House to go my Rounds into Turnbull-street , and I told Crawley who was with me , that I would first step again to the Watch House : There came four Horses and passed me ; the fifth was about ten or a dozen Yards behind the other , and I had not above two Steps to go , before I could have got quite 'cross the Way . The fifth Horse met me , and rode up against me , and I held up my Staff just so , which made him start , and the Man on his Back struck at me : Upon that I struck the Horse on the Head , thinking I had as much Authority in the Night as he ; and then he fired a Pistol . A second Man then came up , and I hit the Horse a good Knock , which made him turn round with his Tail to me . The second Man ( whom I apprehend to be one of the four that passed by me ) fired a Pistol directly at me . I plaid about with my Constable 's Staff , which is about 8 Feet long , hitting first one Horse , and then the other : They fired seven more at me , and I had no other Chance to save my Life , but by keeping the Horses in an unsettled Motion . An eighth Pistol was fired , and I never heard Crawley say any Thing till the Men were gone off , and then he said , Master , I am wounded ! I am shot ! There were five Horses in all , four passed me , and the other had not , and there were two Men that fir 'd at me . Q . Did the People belonging to the other four Horses go off ? Portman . I saw none but the two Men that came up to me afterwards ; the rest of the Company were gone before . I apprehend that the last Pistol shot Crawley , for I did not hear him say any Thing 'till they were gone off , though he was within 7 or 8 Yards of me . Q . How long had the Men been gone off , before Crawley said he was shot ? Portman . They had not got two Yards before he spoke : Master , ( said he ) I am a dead Man ! I am shot in the Arm ! and if he ever saw the Face again he could know him . - I hope I never can err , but what I say is Truth , therefore I do tell you , we got Crawley to the Watch-House , by the Assistance of a Man who rose in his Shirt , and a Watchman : One took hold of his Arm , and the other his Legs , and I carried the two Lanthorns . Then I went to call Mr. Woodburne , a Surgeon , who does the Parish Business : He would not get up , but however at last he sent his Man , and upon pulling off Crawley 's Cloaths , he said there were five Ballets or Slugs in the Man 's Arm ; it was in this Part of the Arm , a little below the Elbow . Q . What Distance might these Wounds be from each other ? Portman . About an Inch Distance ; there were three on a Row , and two length Ways ; but in my Surprize , I ca n't give the Particulars of that ; but if I may speak my Heart , I believe it could be by one Discharge only . Mr. Woodburne 's Man telling me he could do nothing for him , I called a Chair , and carried him to the Hospital , where he died that Day Week , as they told me , much about the Time that he was shot . Now I come to the Prisoner : After I had given my Information before Justice Poulson , Mr. Foster came to the Justice 's for the Tea , and I told him the same as I have said now ; this was on the Monday Morning . When we had been there some Time , Mr. Foster said he was dry , and so after we had been to a Butcher 's , and weigh 'd the Tea , we went to the Hole in the Wa ll , I think it was , where we sat down in the back Room , and had a Tankard of Beer . When we had drank best Part of a 2d Pot , Mr. Foster said to one Mr. Quaife , who was in our Company , I am very uneasy about your Friend John ! Why do n't you fetch your Friend John ? Mr. Quaife then went out , and I told Mr. Foster , these Men were cowardly Fellows , for five of them need not have trifled with me with Fire-Arms : However presently in comes Mr. Bolton , or Bolter , the Prisoner ; - he had Boots on then , and he had not come within a Yard of me , before I said to Mr. Foster , I have made the Face ! That is the Man ! I sat between Mr. Foster and another Man ; one bobb 'd me on one Knee , and the other on the other : - The Truth will never err : - All the Council in England ca n't baffle me : - Here are two Lives lost . Then the Prisoner got behind me , and laid up against the Dresser , and I challenged him again : Gentlemen , ( said I ) I will assure you this is the very Man ! That is the very Mark ! Mr. Foster bobb 'd me on one Side , and the other Man on the other , a second Time ; and on my repeating my Assurances a third Time , they bobb 'd me again in the same Manner . Observing no Body take Notice of what I said , I told them I must go Home , for I was not safe in their Company : Mr. Foster said I was very safe , for Bolton was a Custom-House Officer : With that , my Spirits were quite flagg 'd and daunted ; and so I took up my Pipe , and would stay t'other Tankard . I jostled my Chair about , and fac 'd the Prisoner : Heark ye , my Friend , ( said I ) what Countryman are you ? Where dost live ? The Prisoner spoke not a Word , good , bad , or indifferent ; with that Mr. Foster said , you Blockhead , why do n't you come into Company ? Then the Prisoner sat down , and he made the sixth Man in the Company ; and I told them again , I was sure he was the Man . Then the Argument ceased , and Mr. Poulson 's Clerk came in : It seems he was to do something for Mr. Foster about a Cart Load of Tea that had been seized , and he desir 'd it might be let alone till Morning , for he could not do it that Night C. I thought it was Morning when you was at the Hole in the Wall ? Portman . No ; it was between ten and eleven at Night ; I never said it was Morning : However we staid till the Paper was done , and Mr. Scavendish ( Mr. Poulson 's Clerk ) being going to his Father 's , I was glad of the Opportunity , and said I would go with him . Before I got out of the House , I told him that I believed the Prisoner to be one of the Men that shot at me and Isaac Crawley . I went Home to Bed , but could not sleep , so I got up next Morning , and went to Mr. Poulson 's ; this was Tuesday Morning : I told him the same as I have said now ; and Mr. Poulson wrote to Mr. Foster to bring the Man , and I waited all Day , but he did not come . The next Day , which was Wednesday , Mr. Foster was ordered by the Commissioners to bring Bolton to me ; and they accordingly came on the Friday following , and four or five more with them . Mr. Foster desired I might look over these Men , for perhaps I might know some of them , and the right Man he said was just by , and he would send for him . I looked at them , and thought it not usual to be trifled with , and I looked on the Ground for some Time : Then I got up , and spoke to the Prisoner . Says Mr. Foster hastily , Which is the Man among all these ? So I went up to Bolton , put my Hat between his Legs , and said , That is the Man . He was then committed upon my believing him to be the Man , as I do still . Q . You say it was between Two and Three of the Clock : What Sort of a Morning was it ? Portman . It was Moon-light , and there were two Pistols discharged ; one behind , and another before me ; besides the Watchmen had their Lanthorns . Q . Do you take the Prisoner to be the first or the second Man that attacked you ? Portman . That is the biggest Thing that has puzzled me ; for the Horses turned about so , that I ca n't say as to that ; but he had on a light Duffill Coat , and a Great Coat over it . Q . Do you recollect the Man by his Habit , his Stature , or his Face ? Portman . By the Face , and nothing else : I never saw him with my Eyes before that Night . One of the Men had a hoarse , coarse Voice ; and the other a smooth Voice . Q . Did the Prisoner speak when he came into the Hole in the Wall ? Portman . No , not a Word : I have heard him speak since , but I ca n't recollect him by his Voice . Q . Had the Person who attacked you a Hat on ? Portman . Yes , they had both Hats on ; but to be sure I must be in a good deal of Confusion , for one of the Pistols took a Button-hole off here , and another shot through my Great Coat . The Terror of the Prisoner 's Face being then upon me , occasioned me to speak when he came into the Company . I have one Thing more to say : - They brought one Luke Harding to speak in the Prisoner 's Behalf , and his Voice is hoarse and coarse , and I was as positive to his Voice , as I am now to the Prisoner 's Face . Pris . Ask him , Whether when we were at Mr. Poulson 's on Friday Night , he did not declare to Thomas Davage and Thomas Quaife , in the lower Room , if Mr. Foster had told him I was an Officer , he would not have carried the Thing so far , but as he had begun , he would go through with it ? Portman . I never did in my Life . Pris . Q . Did you give any particular Description that Night of the Persons supposed to commit this Fact , whereby there was an Advertisement put into the Papers ? Portman . You must first and foremost set me out in the Light that I am , for I can neither write or read : I did give a Description to Mr. Poulson . Pris . Q . Do you know your own Mark if you see it ? Portman . Yes , it is a Figure of Two : - I ca n't say whether this is my Mark , because I seldom turn the Tail so high ; but I did set my Mark to a Writing at Mr. Poulson 's , but I do n't know that Writing if I were to see it . Pris . Q . Do you believe that to be your Mark or not ? Portman . I ca n't say whether it is or not , I seldom turn the Tail so high . Pris . Q . Do you think that Paper was sign 'd by you or not ? Portman . If I was to speak as I think , I did not ; if I did , it must be my Trembling or Surprize . Pris . Q . Was the Paper which you signed read over to you ? Portman . Yes ; I believe that was the first that was made , and was thrown away , and I never sign 'd any afterwards . Pris . Q . Did the Paper which you signed contain a Description of the Person supposed to shoot Crawley ? Portman . Yes ; the first that Mr. Poulson wrote did , and I signed it . Pris . Q . Did not you give that Description on Monday Night ? Portman . Yes ; and the Prisoner was taken up the Friday following . I have no more Witnesses but myself , for there were only Crawley and I there . Prisoner . On Saturday Night I was with Thomas Quaife and Thomas Davage : We were ordered by Mr. Foster to go to the End of Long-Lane , for there were five Horses with Tea come in that Morning , and we were to see if they moved them . We went there first , and were suspicious of two Houses in Three-Fox-Court , upon which we got a Constable and rummaged those Houses , but we did not find the Goods . After we had parted with the Constable , we went to the Place to wait , and between nine and ten o'Clock a Boy came by with an half hundred Bag : We followed him , and in St. John's-street we asked him if he had got a Permit : He would not tell us , so we follow 'd him as far as Chancery-Lane , and then he shewed us the Permit . We then went back to Long-Lane , and waited till eleven o'Clock : And in the Road , going Home , just before we came to Moorfields , there were some People up in a House , and we went in to drink . Davage went away before one o'Clock ; Quaife and I staid and drank till near three o'Clock , and then we went Home together into Tower-Street . Portman . The Thing was done between Two and Three . Mr. Poulson . This Paper was read over to Portman , and he made his Mark . - This is my Hand-writing : - It is Portman 's Information , taken the 5th of April . It was read . John Portman , Constable , of St. James 's , Clerkenwell , maketh Oath , That on Sunday the 4th of April , 1742 , about Two o'Clock in the Morning , in the Road near Clerkenwell-Green , he , this Deponent , saw five Men mounted on Horseback , with Loads on their Horses ; one of which Horses ran against this Deponent , and had like to have thrown him down ; upon which this Deponent held up his Constable 's Staff to defend himself , and immediately the Man mounted on the said Horse discharged divers Pistols or Blunderbusses at this Deponent and his Watchman , Isaac Crawley , and wounded the said Crawley in his Arm , and lodged 5 Slugs therein : And this Deponent farther faith , That the Man that rode on the said Horse , and discharged several Blunderbusses or Pistols as aforesaid , was a lusty Man , about 40 Years of Age , of a swarthy Complection , pitted with the Small-Pox , and had on a Wig of a darkish Colour , a light-coloured Duffell Coat , and a Great Coat over it , and the Horse or Mare he rode on was of a large Size , a dark Bay with cropp 'd Ears ; the Saddle he rode on ( which was dropt from the Horse ) is a brown Leather Saddle , with four Staples and two Leather Straps , such as are usually used by Smugglers , with a Woollen Saddle-Cloth , chequ 'd with blue and white , with one Girt and a Circingle : And this Deponent further faith , That one of the other four Men , who were in Company with this sad ( said ) Man , rode on a large black Horse , and was a lusty Man , in a light-coloured Great Coat , and he turned back and fired four Pistols , or Blunderbusses , at this Deponent and his Watchman : And this Deponent further faith , That one of the other three Horses was a spotted Horse , with a bald Face . The March 2 of JOHN PORTMAN Mr. Foster . I have known the Prisoner Ten Years : He has been an Officer in our Commission about six Years , and is an established Weigher upon the Keys . He has behaved exceeding well , and discharged his Trust faithfully . About the 3d of April I received Information , that five Horses of run Tea had been unloaded at One in the Morning , at the End of Long-Lane , next Smithfield ; but the Person that saw them unload , did not know into what House the Goods were put . About 6 in the Evening I sent for the Prisoner and Thomas Quaife , who is likewise an Officer of the Customs , and directed them to go into Long-Lane , and to search a House or two ; but if they did not find the Goods there , I ordered them to wait , as privately as they could , 'till Ten or Eleven o'Clock ; for my Information was , that before the Watch came about , the Goods would be moved . As to what Portman has been pleased to say , - I was before Mr. Poulson when this Examination was taken , and I saw him sign it . Mr. Poulson directed me to come for the Tea , and there were twenty-five Pounds delivered to me , and I was willing to hear what Account Portman gave of these Smugglers , believing we might find something of Service to the Revenue . Accordingly when he had given this Information , we went to the Hole in the Wall , that we might talk more freely . I took Quaife and Davage with me . Bolton happened not to be at this House so soon as I expected , so I sent Quaife for him , that he might hear what the Constable said . Quaife brought him in , and he sat down in a Chair near a quarter of an Hour The Prosecutor ( Portman ) did say something that he had made the Face , upon which I bid Bolton come round that Portman might have a fair Light Accordingly he came towards the Dresser , where he staid all the Time that the Constable was there . On the Friday following , by the Conmissioner 's Directions I went with the Prisoner before Mr. Poulson , and I thought it would be Justice to take one or two Men with me , who went with Bolton upon the Information , and who would know it he was absent from them ; but Portman did not pitch upon any of them but the Prisoner . As to Bolton , I have sent him upon different Occasions , where his Life has been in great Danger , and he always behav 'd as a faithful Servant ought to do . I heard Portman give the Description of the Man that did this Fact , and it does not answer the Prisoner , neither in the Features , Age , nor having the Small Pox . I never saw Bolton wear a black Wig , but when he is about his common Business , he has such a Wig as Countrymen usually wear . Portman has likewise said , that Mr. Poulson wrote to me on the Tuesday to bring the Prisoner : the Reason why I did not , was because I had sent him with a Summons to a Man in the Country , to shew Cause why his Cart should not be forfeited , for having in it about eleven hundred Weight of Tea . And at the Hole in the Wall , I do n't know but I might touch him with my Knee , and I desir 'd him not to talk in that Manner in a public Ale-House , for the Man was a Custom-House Officer . Thomas Quaife . I remember this Night very well : I was going down Tower-street between 5 and 6 in the Evening ; I believe it was the 3 of April , Mr. Foster was standing at the Dolphin Tavern Door , and call 'd to Bolton and me , and gave us Directions to go into Long-Lane by Smith-field . He ordered us to go and search some Houses in Three-Fox-Court , and if we did not find the Tea , we were to stay in Smithfield 'till eleven o'Clock or thereabouts . We took Davage with us , and applied to one Timothy Powel a Constable , in Charterhouse-Lane , and by Vertue of a Writ of Assistance , and my Deputation , we took him with us , and search 'd two Houses in Three Fox-Court , and when we had done it was dark , pretty near 8 o'Clock . We all agreed after this to go and drink , and we accordingly went to a Public House in Charter-house-lane , and had some Beer , and I believe it was near 9 o'Clock before we parted with the Constable . Then Bolton , Davage and myself went into Smithfield , and about ten , or hardly so much , there came a Boy , his Name is John Colcart , and who is a Servant to a Grocer . He had on his Head a Sack with an Oil Skin Bag in it , which I took to be Tea . I ask 'd him , if he had any Permit ; he said , if I wanted to know , I should go with him into Long-Acre . I was not willing to give the Boy any Suspicion , so I said to Bolton , John , you know that is our Way home , we will go with him : He led us into Chancery lane , and when we came near the Golden Iyon , he said he would not make us go any farther , and so he shewed us the Permit . We then returned to Smithfield , as fast as we could ; it might then be better than a Quarter after ten . We had given Davage Directions to wait there till we came back , and there we found him . We staid there till near half an Hour after eleven to no Purpose , and then we agreed to return home : Davage liv 'd in Spittle Fields , and so we agreed to go over Moorfields . When we came into Chiswel-street , we agreed to drink at the first House that should be open . Davage and the Prisoner ask 'd me where I would go ? I told them , if Luke Harding was up , I would go there , for I wanted a Pair of Gloves . Accordingly we went in , and call 'd for a Pot of Beer , and staid there all three in Company 'till better than half an Hour after 12 o'Clock . A Person then came in , who said she had been 'frighted by Thieves in the Fields , and we were detain 'd in Talk 'till very near three o'Clock ; - Davage left us before one . About two o'Clock a poor Woman came in , who carried a Basket in the Market , and I began to talk with her . Bolton pretended to her , that he was my Servant , and I made her believe that I was in Love with her . Bolton and I staid there till near three o'Clock , and going over Moorfields , the Watch went three , and we made all the Haste we could Home , thinking our Wives would be 'frighted . We went together to the End of Beer-Lane , in Tower street , near the Custom-house , and Bolton parted from me there . He lives in Crown-court , Seething-lane , and I had but just got up Stairs , when he came back and knock 'd at my Door , and ask 'd for his Wife . I told him she had been gone ever since Evening , and then he went home again : this was about half an Hour after three o'Clock . Pris . Q . Do you remember any Conversation that you ever had with Portman relating to this Prosecution ? Quaife . I was at Mr. Poulson 's when Bolton was examin 'd : Portman , Davage and I , were in Mr. Poulson 's Room , where he examines the Witnesses . I ask 'd Portman how he ever could make this poor Man Satisfaction ? Why , ( said he ) what you mean by that ? You are endeavouring ( answer 'd I ) to swear his Life away when he is an innocent Man : His Answer to that was , if Mr. Foster had told him Bolton was an Officer , and had not jok 'd with him at the Hole in the Wall , he would not have carried it on so far ; but since he had begun , he was resolv 'd to go through with it , let the End be what it would . Hearing him say this , I inform 'd Mr. Poulson of it directly . Mr. Poulson . This Man told me of it , and Portman denied that he ever said so , both to me and Mr. Paul . Thomas Davage . Bolton and Quaife came to my House to desire me to go with them to Mr. Poulson 's , and I accordingly did Mr. Portman took his Hat off , and threw it to Bolton 's Feet , and said , that is the Man ! When the Thing came so hard , it shock 'd me , and Mr. Quaife very much , and we went into the Office : Portman follow 'd us , and I ask 'd him how he could be guilty of such a villainous Thing as to charge Bolton ? I do n't know , ( said he , and walk 'd about ) It is Mr. Foster 's Fault . for if he had been so good to have told me that the Man was an Officer , and had given me civil Language , I had not carried the Thing so far , but as it is , I must go through with it . Quaife and I upon hearing this , went directly and told it to Mr. Poulson , and Mr. Paul , and Mr. Poulson sent for Portman in , and asked him the Question , and he denied that he ever said any such Thing . When Bolton was order 'd from New-Prison to Newgate , I went to Hicks's-Hall , where I happen 'd to see Portman . He seemed to be shy of speaking to me , but I shook Hands with him , and ask 'd him what he design 'd to do . He complain 'd of his Attendance on Mr. Foster and the Commissioners , and he said , he pitted the poor Fellow in Prison , for now instead of one Indictment , he might now have four or five against him . Luke Harding . I have known the Prisoner a great many Years . On the 3d of April , between 11 and 12 o'Clock , he and Quaife , and Davage , came to my House in Chiswell-street , and call 'd for Beer . They said with me from between 11 and 12 'till I open 'd the Door to let the Watchman in at 3 o'Clock to let him have something to drink . They did not all go away together , for Davage went out about One ; he saw they were for drinking , and therefore he would go , but Quaife and Bolton did not go 'till near three o'Clock . Mary Harding . I have known the Prisoner these 8 Years . On Saturday Night , the 3d of April , between 11 and 12 , nearer 12 I believe it was , he came into my House with Mr. Quaife : There was a third Person whom I take to be Davage , but I did not know him so well as the others . He ( Davage ) went away at one , but Bolton and Quaife staid 'till 3 , and then went away together . I know it was 3 o'Clock , because the Watchman came about , and he is pretty particular . Ann Burgess . On Saturday Night the 3d of April , between 11 and 12 , the Prisoner came into my Mistress ( Harding 's ) House , and when the Watchman came three o'Clock , he went away . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and the Court granted him a Copy of his Indictment . 52. William Briers , was indicted for stealing 2 brown Perukes , the Goods of Arden Bonnell , March 23 .

The Counsel for the Prosecution having open 'd the Indictment , proceeded to call the following Witnesses to support the Charge . John Cardel . I know the Defendant very well . He was a Brasier by Trade ; I have known him follow that Business 8 or 10 Years . Counc . Def . Did you know him follow it at the Time of the Commission of Bankrupt ? Cardel . Yes . Counc . Did you know Jean Brifant ? Cardel . Yes , he was what we call a French-Plate-Worker , and I know of above an hundred Pounds worth of his Goods , which I myself have taken in , and enter 'd into Mr. Green 's Book . Counc . Def . Was there no Payment made by Green ? Cardel . Not one single Payment of 20 s. to my Knowledge . Here is the Book where I set it down . I was Green 's Servant , and he often sent me to Brifant 's House to look out Goods for Sale . Here the Commission of Bankrupt was read . Counc . Def . Why you talk of a little Brass ting 'd over with a Silver Colour ! an hundred Pounds is a great deal of Money ! Cardel . I understand the Business a little better than you : there were Goods to that Value according to the Market Price . Counc . Def . Will you venture to say there were 5 l. worth of Silver on all that you took in ? Cardel . That is not material , if it was the Market Price . I took Care not to pay more than the common Price , because I understood them better than Mr. Green . Counc . Def . I do n't impeach your Understanding : was there the whole Value of fourscore Pounds brought into your Shop ? Cardel . I dare say there were upwards of 100 l in Brass , Silver and Workmanship . Counc . Def . How long did you leave Green before he fail 'd ? Cardel . I believe 3 or 4 Months . Counc . Def . So then you ca n't say there were 100 l. due when Green fail 'd ? Cardel . No , but when I left him there was so much due . Q . How long before you left the Defendant , were the last Goods sent in on Brifant 's Account ? Cardel . That I ca n't say , for we had Trifles often coming in : we receiv 'd a great Quantity that were pack 'd up as if they were going abroad . I receiv 'd with my own Hands to the Value of 113 l. and to my Knowledge none of them were paid for . Counc . Def . Did you never hear Brifant say he had received Money ? Cardel . No , I never did . Counc . Did you ever deny Green to any Body ? Cardel . Yes , to Mr. Rudge 's Clerk : He desired me not to let him be troubled with such People , in April 1740 . Counc . Did you know that these People were Creditors ? Cardel . Yes , Rudges Clerk asked me for Money : we took our Beer of Mr. Rudge . I have likewise denied him to Mr. Hopkins a Glazier . Q . Where was Green when you denied him to Mr. Rudge 's Clerk ? Cardel . Sometimes he has been out , but I have denied him when he has been above Stairs in the House . Counc . Def . Had not your Master a Lodging at Hackney ? Cardel . Yes , but Mr. Rudge served us with Beer in Town : I ca n't tell whether he did the same in the Country . Counc . Def . Then you do n't know but that Mr. Rudge and your Master might have settled Accounts ? Cardel . I do n't know that they did . Q . Did Hopkins the Glazier do any Business for your Master ? Cardel . I ca n't say that ; I have heard that he glaz 'd the House . Mr. Coningsby . I was one of the Commissioners named in this Commission , and it was on the 15th of Nov. 1740 . Mr. Malmot , Mr. Salkeld , and my self took the Oath as the Act directs . The Purport of it was , `` I Roger Coningsby do swear , I `` will faithfully and impartially execute the Trust `` reposed in me ; so help me God . '' We that Day declared the Defendant a Bankrupt . Mr. Malmot , Mr. Salkeld , Mr. Whitorne , and myself were Commissioners , and this is the original Declaration made by us as Commissioners . Here the Declaration was read , together with the Notice in the Gazette , for Prior Green to surrender himself for Examination , the 24th of Nov. and the 1st and 30th of Dec. Mr. Coningsby . The Defendant did surrender himself on the 24th of Nov. but for the Particulars of the Examination , I must refer myself to the Proceedings which I have sign 'd . They were read , and it appear 'd by them that the Defendant did surrender himself to Mr. Coninsby , Mr. Melmot , Mr. Conway , and Mr. Whitorne , and that being on Oath , he said he was not prepar 'd to make a Discovery of his Effects , therefore desired farther Time , which accordingly was granted . Counc . Did Mr. Whitorne qualifie himself when he fate ? Mr. Coningsby . I must beg Leave to refresh my Memory ; if you will cast your Eye upon that Place , you will find he was sworn . Counc . Now as to the Defendants signing his Surrender ; - is that his Hand-writing ? Mr. Coningsby . I believe it to be so by my signing it , and I am very sure it was read to him , for I never allow these Things to be sign 'd till they are read carefully over . Counc . Def . Is it not common to take these Things away from the Table , and not sign them before you ? Mr. Coningsby . No , they are always sign 'd before me . The next meeting we had was on the 15th of December , at the Crown-Tavern , but I beg to be guided by the Proceedings all along , though I very well remember I was there . Thomas Malcher , Green 's Apprentice was there , but he had received great Threats from his Master , and it was sometime before we could give him Spirits , but at last he was examin 'd , and I believe this might be his Examination . Mr. Green bid us Defiance very much , and behav 'd quite unbecoming his Condition . Counc . Was he sworn then ? Mr. Coningsby . I verily believe he was , but I ca n't tell who swore him , for sometimes one does it , and sometimes another . I am sure one of the Commissioners gave him the Oath . I ca n't remember the particular Questions and Answers at that Time , but it appear 'd to us , that he had paid Wm Warden his Book-keeper , at his Shop in Moorfields , 20 l. which he represented to us a fair Debt , whereas no such Money was due . Mr. Goulder . I was Clerk to this Commission . and when the Defendant appear 'd on the 15th of December , 1740 , I was present all the Time : Three was an Enquiry made with regard to 20 l. that he had paid to one Warden , and which Warden returned him again : He said it was all due to Warden for Wages and Board : He was contradicted in that by a Receipt in full but the Midsummer before , for Wages and Board He was then asked , if Warden did not return him that 20 l again , and he said he did not . This was at the Crown Tavern , and I believe he was an Hour on his Examination . There is another Examination of the 17th of February , and for Particulars , I must refer to that . Counc . Def . Did not you fetch the Defendant from an Alehouse the 15th of December , for Examination ? Mr. Goulder . No , I never was at an Alehouse with him in my Life : He might be fetched from thence for ought I know . Counc . Def . Was he not disguised in Liquor ? Mr. Goulder . He might for ought I know , for he behaved very badly , and I believe he had been drinking pretty freely ; but he was pretty sober when he attended the Commissioners afterwards , and then he accounted for the 20 lbs . Counc . Def . Was he ever offered his Certificate ? Mr. Goulder . I ca n't tell . Council to Mr. Coningsby . Do you think that the Defendant was on the 15th of December so disguised as not to be examined ? Mr. Coningsby . To be sure if I had thought him so , I would not have examin 'd him ; but what with Passion or Liquor , he seemed always to be outragious : I never saw him otherwise . Mr. Goulder . I believe he generally was in Liquor , except the last Day , which was the Time that he explained himself ; then he was tolerably sober . The Lord Chancellor 's Order , for enlarging the Time for the Defendant , was read , being first proved by Mr. Goulder . Mr. Coningsby . This Examination was taken in February , 1740 , and I saw the Defendant sign it . It was read , and the Purport of it was , That Prior Green surrendered himself the 17th of February , 1740 , to the major Part of the Commissioners , and upon Oath said , That the Writing mark 'd D , the several Books mark 'd A B C , and the Writings mark 'd E and F , did contain a full Disclosure of all his Effects . Then several Interrogatories , which were sent to the Defendant , were read to the following Effect . Did you , or did you not go from your late Dwelling-house in Cheapside , to the Crown Tavern in or near Bloomsbury ? The Answer was , - That the Defendant did some Time before the Commission , go to the Crown Tavern in Bloomsbury . Did you , or did you not carry with you , an Iron Chest ? The Defendant said , - He did get a Porter to carry an Iron Chest to the Crown Tavern . What was contained in it ? What Money , & c. ? - There were a Silver Tankard , six large Spoons , six small Tea-spoons , and a small Sum of Money , not exceeding 20 l. and no other Effects whatsoever , & c. The last Question , contained in the Writing mark 'd F , was , Did you not , on or about the 13th of November , 1740 , pay William Warden Twenty Pounds , and whether he did not return it again ? The Answer was , - That he did pay 20 l. and that Warden did return it again . Thomas Malcher , the Defendant 's Apprentice , deposed , That Warden was first his Master 's Journeyman in Cheapside , and afterwards at his Shop at Moorfields , and that Cardel lived with him at the same Time : That on the 13th of November , before the Commission came out the Defendant told Warden , he had received a Sum of Money from Mr . Waters , a Baker , and desired him ( Warden ) to give him a Receipt for 20 l. for fear he should he called to an Account for the Money , at the same Time telling Warden , he might receive the Money , and give it him again : That a great many Persuasions were made use of , and at last Warden did give him a Receipt , and paid the Money back again to the Defendant , in the Space of five Minutes : That he ( this Witness ) was in the Room at the same Time , and that one Edmund Eyles , who is dead , was a Witness to the Receipt : That after the issuing of the Commission , he moved two Stove Grates to his Mother 's House ; that one of them was by the Defendant 's Orders taken away by a Porter , and the other was put into a Coach in Cheapside and carried off . This Witness added , That he was sent by Warden to fetch a Shop-Book which was concealed in an Alley in Moorfields , Being asked , Whether there were not some Iron Bars put up at the Defendant 's House , to prevent his throwing himself out of the Window , he answered , He believed there were some put up , but he believed they were to prevent him from doing himself any Mischief when in Liquor . We can only say in general , that several Witnesses was called by the Prisoner 's Council , to prove , that the Property of the Goods in Dispute , was not the Prisoner 's , but other Peoples ; and others , to prove , that he had for some time past committed Acts tending to Lunney ; and it being allowed by the Attorney for the Prosecutor 's that the Debts proved , amounted to 1300 l. and that they had received in Money and Effects 1100 l. upon the whole the Jury acquitted him .
