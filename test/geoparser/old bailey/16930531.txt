The Counsel for the King opened the Indictment to the Gentlemen of the Jury , and told them that the said Cave was Barbarously Murdered . The Evidence was first Mr. White the Coroner , who declared that he sate upon the dead Body , and that one Mr. Stanley who is now dead was the chief Witness of the matter of Fact , and his Examination was read in Court , which set forth that Mr. Cave that was Kill 'd , and he , and Mr. D - were all at the Chocolate-house in Bridges-street in Covent-Garden on the day abovesaid , and Mr. D - presently charged Mr. Cave with taking off his Hat and Perriwig on the Night before .

There were several other Evidences that gave the same Account , how that the Prisoners both pursued the said Quoyne , and Carter was seen to run him into the Belly , upon which he dropt down dead , and the blood gushed out at his Mouth by the force of Carter 's trampling upon him ; this was the Evidence for the King . The Prisoners were demanded what they could say in their defence ; Carter said , That he being coming out of the Necessary House , he saw several of the Soldiers about Nichols with their Swords drawn , and he coming to his assistance , the Deceased struck at him with a Sword , to save which blow , he held up his Arm , and received a wound from him upon the same ( which he shewed in Court ) ; then he retreated to some adjacent Pales , and set his back against them , and then the Deceased coming after him , he drew his Sword to defend himself , which he called some Witnesses to arrest ; Nichols alledged to the same purpose , how that the Soldier Casey challenged him to fight ; and told him , that he deserved to be knocked off his Horse , for that his Horse stood cross the Gate-way , which hindered the Soldiers passage , which he had Witness to attest ; and that there were almost 20 Swords drawn upon them at the latter end of the Fray ; and if they had not made opposition , they might have been killed , & c. So the Court directed the Jury , in point of the Evidence on both sides ; telling them , That there was no doubt to be made , but that Quoyne was kill 'd by the hands of the Prisoners ; but the Evidence was not full enough to make it Murther ; So they were both found guilty of Manslaughter , and were acquitted upon the Statute of Stabbing .

The second Entitled , A French Conquest neither desirable , nor practicable . After the Indictment was read , The Prisoner pleaded Not guilty ; And the Court upon his Request ordered him a Copy of the Pannel , and gave him time till Saturday to prepare for his Trial . Accordingly , on Saturday morning about Nine a Clock he was again brought to the Bar ; and the Gentlemen that were summoned to appear to try the Issue were called over , and their Appearances recorded ; and the Prisoner had liberty to make his Exceptions , according to the Prescription of Law , which he did to the number of 35 , being the full number , & c. The Jurors sworn were these Gentlemen whose names follow , viz . Crisp Grainge . Joseph Blissett . Joseph Bowler . John Hynde . Robert Hinde . Simon Smith . Thomas Rumidge . Robert Longland . Ralph Hutchinson . John Outing . Samuel Freebody . Moses Colwell . Then the King 's Council opened the nature of the matter of Fact contained in the Indictment , telling them , That the Offence that was contained in it , was High-Treason in the highest degree , ( viz . ) The compassing and designing the death of the King and Queen ; and that there must be some Overt Act to discover the Intention of the man ; and that which made the Overt Act in this Case , was in Composing , Printing , Publishing and dispersing of two Treasonable Libels , as they had heard read to them ; in which there was contained , the Rankest , Vilest , and most malicious Treasons that ever could be imagined by any man to be put into Paper ; for he had no other name for the King , but the Prince of Orange ; and the design of it was merely to incite all the King 's Subjects to stir up , and raise War and Rebellion against him , and to restore the Late King James . After which the Evidence for the King were called and sworn , the first of which was Mr. Robert Stephens , Messenger of the Press , who declared , That he had known the Prisoner for above these two years to be an Offender against the Government in printing Seditious Libels , but never could tell where he worked till on the 2d day of May last spying two Journey-men Printers , who he had missed from the publick Printing-houses this half year , he followed them , and saw them go exactly into the House of one Skudamore ( where the Prisoner was found ) and where he suspected they worked privately : So having got the Beadle , and another person or two with him , to assist him , he went to the Door , leaving the other a little way off , to avoid any suspicion , & c. When he came to the Door , he first asked what Lodgers they had , then turning his head aside , he saw the Prisoner 's Mother in the Yard , and she well knowing Mr. Stephens , she immediately cry d out Thieves , and came up to him , ( her Daughter , the Prisoner 's Wife , being with her ) fell upon him , and tore his hair off his Head , crying out Murther ; at which time the Prisoner came out of the House , and fell upon him , and abused him in a very uncivil manner , telling him he scorned to be a Subject to Hook-Nose ; then the Beadle and the other person came to his assistance , and took the Prisoner , but not without a great deal of trouble : Mr. Stephens , and , the other who were with him made a particular search , and in a Chamber , which the Landlady said was the Prisoner 's Lodgings , and that he went by the name of Williams , and a Lapidary by Trade , and where he owned he had been asleep . There they saw him shoving a Bed , which run upon Wheels , close up against a Wall , which gave suspicion to Mr. Stephens to remove it , which having done , there he found a Door which opened with a Latch , and entring a Room , where he found a Printing press , Letters , and all other Materials fit for the Trade ; and searching farther , he found in an old Trunk a great quantity of Libels , and Libellous Pamphlets ; one Entitled , A Caution to the Navy ; another , Historical Remarks upon the Wars ; another , A Second Letter to the Bishop of Salisbury ; and there was an Errata , and an & c. found set in the Press , the very same that were in the Book called , Remarks upon the Confederacy : And in the Chamber where he lay , there was a Desk ( which Mr. Stephens knew well to be the Prisoners , because he had seized it before ) ; in which Desk there was found the two Libels ( as in the beginning of the Trial ) and divers others of the same sort , which Desk the Prisoner owned to be his ; these they seized and secured , having first put their private Marks upon the Libels , that they might know them to be the same , and conveyed them with the Prisoner , to the Lord Chief Justice Hole 's Chamber in a Coach ; and being alighted at the Door , whilst Mr. Stephens was looking for Money to pay the Coachman , the Prisoner made his escape through Serjeant 's Inn , but was soon overtaken by the Porter : He was examined by my Lord , and committed to Newgate , for High-Treason ; This was fully and clearly proved against him on the King 's side , and the Libels were some part of them read in Court , in which were found abundance of Base , Vile , Scandalous and Traiterous Expressions , enough to make any honest Englishman to hate and abominate all such Traiterous and disaffected Principles . That Libel called , A Caution to the Navy , which was taken in the Printing-room , was proved to be corrected by the hand of the Prisoner ; and those Letters that were in the Form , upon which the Caution to the Navy was printed , was also proved to be printed with one and the same Letter , and Character , & c. as the Libels he was Indicted for . Then the Prisoner made his Defence ; telling the Court , That the matter that was given in Evidence against him was not sufficient to make it an Overt-Act , therefore could not be adjudged High-Treason , praying that he might have Counsel allowed him to plead it , being a matter of Law . To which he was answered by the Court , that the question was Whether he printed those Treasonable Books , which plainly answered that he did , for they were all found ( with the Press also ) upon him , and his so printing of them was an Overt-Act in the Judgment of the Law ; therefore the Person so offending must be guilty of High Treason , desiring him , if he had any Witnesses , to call them ; to which he replied , That he had none , but desired that he might have leave to put the Jury in mind of two or three things , which in the general was , the Opinion of my Lord Cook , as to Matter of Law in his Case ; who says , That it must be done with the Intention of the mind , and that it must be some injury done to the King 's person , by buying a Gun or Gunpowder , or Poyson , or the like , before it can be accounted an Overt-Act , and there was no such thing proved against him : To which the Court replied , That in Primitive Times , before Printing was Invented , writing was found to be an Overt-Act , and made High-Treason ; therefore Printing was more manifestly an Overt-Act : And there was no room for any Counsel to be assigned to him , for there was no matter of Law for them to plead to ; and therefore desired him not to give the Court any unnecessary trouble ; adding , That it was the Opinion of the whole Court , that he had no grounds for such a Plea ; but if he had any thing to offer that might be any way advantageous to him ; they would very patiently hear it . Then the Lord Chief Justice Treby summ 'd up the Evidence to the Gentlemen of the Jury , Telling them what dangerous Consequences such Treasonable Libels were of ; and that it was as great , and as malicious a Treason as ever could be imagined ; but especially when considered to be done against so good a Prince , who had done so much for this Nation , with so great a mind , and so good an intent : This was done only to exasperate , and to stir up Sedition and Rebellion amongst us ; therefore if they did believe what the Witness for the King had sworn , to be sufficient Evidence that he printed the Libels , then they must find him guilty , otherwise acquit him . Then the Jury having withdrawn for about three hours time , they brought a Verdict , That the Prisoner , Mr. William Anderton , was guilty of High-Treason . The last day of the Sessions he was brought to the Bar , and asked what he had to say why Sentence should not pass upon him according to Law : He read a Petition , wherein he desired the Court would please to allow him Counsel , to plead to a point of Law ; the Court told him there was no matter of Law did arise . Then he desired that he might have a longer time than the rest ; to which he was answered , That it was in the power of the Queen to do that and not the Court . [ Death . See summary . ] Angell Rolph Wife of John Rolph , and Edward Boyce appeared in Court , and an Indictment of Felony was Read against them , for that whereas one [ Text unreadable in original . ] was Convicted the last Sessions of Felony and Burglary , for that they the fifth day of April last , did break the House of William [ Text unreadable in original . ] and stole 2 Yards of Bone-lace for a Cravat value 5l . and and other Goods , & c. and that the said Angell Rolph knowing the said Felony and Burglary to be done , the said Grace Dempsey , & c. did receive from her the said Dempsey and Edward Boyce , knowing the said Felony and Burglary to be done , did receive , harbour , comfort and maintain her against the Peace of the King and Queen , & c.
