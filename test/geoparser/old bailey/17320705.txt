Ann Parrot , of St . Brides , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 4 l. and 5 s. in Money , from the Person of John Barter , June 26 . John Barter . I am a Journeyman Coach-maker , I live by Cavendish-Square . Last Monday was Sev'n-night I pick 'd up the Prisoner in Fleet-street ; but thought it might not be a-miss to take care of my Watch ; and as I went up Stairs I took it out of my Fob , and put it into my Side-pocket . We had 2 Quarterns of Brandy , which were brought up by another Creature that belong 'd to the House ; I paid 6 d. a Piece for 'em as they came in ; the Prisoner call 'd for a Third , but when I went to pay for it , I found but a Penny in my Pocket , and I had a Crown but 2 Minutes before Missing my Watch too , I desired to have it again , but she said , she had none of it . Then I call 'd for a Watchman , who was a long time a coming ; and then she told me , if I would go up again and lye with her , she would help me to my Watch ; so I agreed to do as she desired me , and sent the Watchman away , in hopes of getting my Watch again , but she would not give it me for all that . Then I call 'd for the Watchman again , and we made shift to get her to the Watch-house . Court . Was not you fuddled ? Barter . No ; I was as sober as a Judge . Court . Did you ever find the Watch again ? Barter . No ; I was in a great Surprize , and did not search the Prisoner . Court . Was the Watchman in a Surprize too ? Why did not he search her ? Barter . Lord bless you ! she kick 'd and beat the Watchman and Constable like any thing . But I was told afterwards , that the Watch was in Pawn . Court . And did not you go to the Pawn-brokers to inquire for it ? Barter . No , I was advis 'd to the contrary , for they said , she would play the Devil with me if I did . She was Wife to Frasier who was hang 'd in Chains ; she has been twice cast for Transportation . Prisoner . When I met this Man in Fleet-street , he was drunk . He took hold of me , and said , he was going home to Grosvenor-Square , and if I would go with him , he would give me half a Crown . No , says I , if you will go to my Lodging , do and welcome ; Well , says he , and so I will then . When he came into my Room , he gave me a Shilling to be familiar with me , and then he pull 'd me and haul 'd me to Pieces , and nothing would serve his turn , truly , but he would needs lie with me all Night , and because I would not let him he has sworn this against me . As for his Watch I saw none that he had , I had but a Shilling about me when the Watchman search 'd me . I could have had a great many good House-keepers to my Character ; but not thinking he would be so Vile and Wicked as to swear this against me , I never sent for them . There 's Jenny Berry , a vile Slut ! that has kept Company with my Husband , since her own Husband was hang 'd in Chains , and she has given this Fellow Money to pick me up in order to have me Transported out of their way ; O Conscience ! Conscience ! do but look in his Face and see how he blushes . The Jury acquitted her . 2. John Green , of St. Giles 's without Cripplegate , was indicted for stealing a Silver-Watch , value 6 l. the Goods of Benjamin Peak , the 20th of May last . The Prosecutor lost his Watch in a Quarrel with William Morris , Thomas Kingland , and - Willet at a Skettle-Ground in Moor-lane , * Morris and Kingland were try 'd last Sessions and acquitted , and the Jury now acquitted Green . * Session's-Paper , Numb .

William Hudson . I got up about 2 a-Clock on Friday Morning , to make an end of my Master 's Work , and between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , I was sent for by a Friend to take Dimensions for making a Hat , I staid drinking new Rum and other Liquors with him till 9 at Night , and then went to drink with others till past a 11 . In my way home to Shadwell , I lay down in Denmark-street in Ratcliffe High-way , I fell fast asleep , and did not wake till 2 in the Morning . At first I wonder 'd where about I was , and what was become of my Shoes and Stockings , my Blue Apron , and my Hat . But at last I bethought my self , that some Body had found me a-sleep in the Street , and had undress 'd me , so I went barefooted as I was towards the Watch-house , to enquire if any idle Person had been taken up ; but I could hear nothing of my Cloaths , till about 9 that Saturday Morning , when a Friend told me that Mr. Ludlow , a Goldsmith , in Upper-Shadwell , had stopp 'd the Prisoner upon her offering to sell him a pair of Silver Buckles which proved to be mine . She was carried before the Justice , and committed to Bridewell , before I saw her , and when John Tucker the Watchman heard of her being taken up , he owned that she had left my Hat , and Shoes , and Stockings , at his House , though he said nothing of it when he saw me go along barefooted . From Bridewell she was carried again before Justice Jones , and she then had my Apron on : He sent her to Newgate . Court . What did she say before the Justice ? Prosecutor . She nothing but Swore and Curs 'd , and talk 'd Bandy . John Tucker . Watchman in Upper-Shadwell . As I was beating my Rounds at one a Clock , I saw the Prisoner sitting at a Door in West-Garden , with a vine Hat in her Lap . What dost thee do here ? says I . Why I want a Dram , says she , will you give me one ? Where didst thee get such a vine Hat ? says I . Why it is my Husband 's Hat , says she again . So I goes home , and she comes to my House , and calls vor a Dram . Well , says I , however thee didst come by this Hat , or where thee didst get'n , the Devil do n't know ; but sure thy Husband never had such a one to his Back . Why , zays she , I have got his Zhoes and Ztockings too in my Apron , and I will leave 'em all with you till by and by . Zo she pull'd'n out , and I took'n and throwd'n by , but I thought they hardly did belong to she . Zo , when she came again vor 'em about 2 a-Clock , zays I , thee must tell me how thee didst come by'n bevore I let thee have'n again . After this I zee a Man coming along bare-vooted , and bare-leg 'd , and without a Hat . Hoy ! hoy ! says I , what a Plague beest thee , that thee runs naked a that'n ; but I did not think that the Things that Prisoner lest at my House did belong to he . John Ludlow . About 8 o'Clock o ' Saturday Morning . The Prisoner offer 'd to sell me these Buckles ; I ask 'd her how she came by 'em , and she said , a Man gave 'em her to lie with her . I suspected she had stol'n 'em , and sent for a Headborough , who carried her before a Justice , by whom she was committed to Bridewell . The Prosecutor came about an Hour after , and claimed the Buckles . He said he lost them as he lay a-sleep in the Street ; they were mark 'd with his Name . Prisoner . After I had sold my Nosegays I met the Prisoner between 9 and 10 at Night , in Ratcliff-Highway . He took me into a dark Entry in an Alley , and after he had had his Will upon me , he said he had no Money , but if I would pawn his Buckles for 7s . 6d . he would give me half a Crown for obliging her . So he took 'em out of his Shoes , and gave 'em me , but I could not get so much upon 'em , and so I went to sell 'em . The Jury found her Guilty to the value of 10d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5. John Adams was indicted for the Murder of Lawrence Howard , by striking him and throwing him on the Ground , by which Blows and Fall , he receiv 'd several mortal Bruises on the Head and Sides , of which he dy 'd next Day . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for Manslaughter . The Prisoner and Deceas 'd were Boy s , who liv 'd in the same Neighbourhood . They and others were playing together at Buff-at-the-Bear . The Deceas 'd being caught , would not lie down and be the Bear ; upon which the others buffeted him . This occasion 'd a Quarrel , he challeng 'd the Prisoner to Box him next Day , in the Long field by the Burying Ground , near Pancras . They met , fought fair ; but the Prisoner striking the Deceas 'd an unlucky Blow on the Head , it broke some of the Blood Vessels , and he dy 'd the next Day . Manslaughter . [ Branding .

He was a second Time indicted for stealing a Drugget Coat , a Pair of Breeches , a Pair of Shoes , a Shirt , a Hat , a Wig , a Gown , a Petticoat , an Apron , and 2 Silver Tea-spoons , and other Things , to the Value of 50 s. the Goods of Robert Dallison , in his House , in the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , June 10 . First Indictment . Ann Coniers . I live in New-Gravel-Lane , and wash Linen for my Livelihood . On the 17th of April I went out about 9 at Night , to get a small Morsel of Money ; but before I went out , I shut my Window-shutter which was within Side , and barr 'd it with this little wooden Bar [ about an Inch square ] and I desired Mrs. Cox , whom I left at Home to lock the Door after me , which I understand she did ; and that then she and my other Lodger went to Bed . I came Home at about Half an Hour past 10 , and found my Door was lock 'd , but my Kitchen-Casement was open , a Pane of Glass was taken out , and my little Bar was cut . When I came in , I mist my Riding-Hood , a Looking-glass , a Shift , and other Linen of my own , and a Box of Linen that belonged to James Rule , and Eliz . Cox . Mr. Parker , the Constable , found one of my Shifts , and my Looking-glass in Rag-Fair . Will . Fleming was taken up on the Friday , and sent me Word on Saturday , that he and the Prisoner were concerned in the Fact . Eliz . Cox . Mrs. Coniers left me in the House , and I locked the Door after her , and went to Bed , and when she came Home , she waked me and said , the House had been broke . I lost a Box of Linen . William Fleming . I and Jack Osborn and Jack Longmore and Prisoner were drinking together at the Black-Boy in Well-street ; but Osborn and Longmore quarrell 'd , and so the Prisoner and I left 'em . Afterwards we went down a Yard to the Prosecutor 's House , where we took a Pane of Glass out of the Window , and cut the little Deal Bar , and open 'd it . The Prisoner went in , and brought out a Looking-Glass and a Riding-Hood . He went in again , and brought out some Towels . Then I went in myself , and got a Box of Linen , and a Pocket which had two Keys in it . It was just Ten a Clock when we had done . When we got into the Street , I open 'd the Box , and saw there was Linen in it , which I carried to the Prisoner 's Maux 's , lodging in Church-Lane , in Rag-Fair . We kept a Shirt a Piece , and gave her two Aprons for herself . She sold some of the Things next Day , in Rag-Fair , and the rest in Chick-Lane , for which she brought us 18 s. but I believe she sunk some of the Cole . I was afterwards taken up for a Street-Robbery with Osborn , Tripland , and Longmore , and sent for Mrs. Coniers , and returned her the Keys . Edward Laurence , Constable , and Joseph Williams . We seiz 'd the Prisoner on Tower-Hill , and carried him to an Ale house in Thames-street . At first he said that he was not Country Bob ( a Name that he used to go by ) but when we told him , we 'd carry him to New-Prison , and shew him to Fleming , he own 'd the Fact , and said , I know I am a dead Man , but I 'll bang that Rogue Fleming if I can for betraying me . If you 'll carry me before Justice Philips , I hope he 'll admit me for an Evidence . Fleming has not put this Burglary into his Information , and I 'll inform against him and others for this , and for stealing a Parcel of Hats on the Thames , and several other Facts . Indeed , I ought to be hanged for a Fool , for coming to Town so soon ; for I had run away to Brentford , where I went to sleep under a Brick-kiln , and burnt my Thigh , so that I have been since . I know Fleming ca n't hurt me for any Thing but this one Fact of breaking the House in New-Gravel-Lane . Prisoner . I have not a Friend in the World , but if you take away my Life , I shall dye as innocent as any Man living . Guilty , Death . Second Indictment . Robert Dallison . The Prisoner lay in a Corner of the same Room that I and my Wife lay in . But there was something placed betwixt the two Beds , to hide one from the other . About 2 in the Morning the Neighbours finding all the Doors open , came in and waked us . Our Goods were lost , and the Prisoner gone ; but I fo und him in Clerkenwell Bridewell on the Friday following , and he had on my Hat , Coat , Breeches , Shoes , and Stockings . He confest before Justice Giffard , that he took them all from me . Court . How came he to lodge in your Room ? Dallison . Very odly . About 3 Weeks before , he was lying asleep upon a Bulk in Bloomsbury-market , with his Shirt hanging out of his Breeches . Some Boys pinn 'd a Paper to his Shirt , and setting Fire to it , burnt his Back-side , upon which he went to a Constable to have them taken up ; and it being said , that my Son was one of them , the Constable told me that I must take Care of him till he was well . Tho ' I have since been informed , that he received but little Hurt by what the Boys did to him , and that he had got the chief Damage before , by lying in a Brick-kiln . Elizabeth Dallison corroborated her Husband 's Evidence . Prisoner . It was Dallison 's Son that pulled out my Shirt , and burnt me shamefully . If you please I can shew you the Marks . And when I first came up to lodge in Mr. Dallison 's Room , he swore he would murder me , and he has owed me a Grudge ever since . Guilty , Death . 7 , 8 , 9.

Brides , were indicted for stealing 150 Brass Patterns , val . 30 l. and a Bell-metal Mortar , value 3 s. 6 d. the Goods of Francis Skelthorn , in his House , June 30 . Francis Skelthorn . I am a Founder . On the 30th of June , in the Night , I lost about 150 Brass Patterns out of my Melting-House in King's-Head-Court , in Shoe-Lane . I knew it could not be done without the Assistance of somebody within the House . William Norman . The Prisoners and I , and Joseph Charley , had agreed to rob Mr. Skelthorn 's House , and John Robins promised to let us in . Between 11 and 12 at Night he let us in , and directed his Brother Valentine where to find the Things , and then went to Bed again ; and Val . went into the Melting-house , and brought out the Patterns , and a Bell-Metal Mortar . We packed 'em up , some in our Pockets , some in our Laps , and some under our Coats , and went to Holbourn , where I left them . Harry Barret told me , that they sold the greatest Part to Winterton , an Ironmonger at the Corner of Gray's-Inn-Lane , for 16 s. and a small Parcel to a Brasier by Smithfield-Bars for 18 d. and the Mortar to one Simon , who lives somewhere about Barbican , for 15 d. Halfpenny . I and Val . Robins went into Beach-Lane , and sold as much as came to 3 s. to a Nail-maker , and 5 s. worth to a Spoon-maker there ; and this was ( 26 s. and 9 d. Halfpenny ) all we made of that Night 's Work . Mr. Skelthorp . When they were carried before Alderman Brocas , they all fell on their Knees , begg 'd for Mercy , and said , that they were persuaded to it by Winterton , and that he bid them bring whatever he could get , and he would buy it of them . Samuel Hobert . All the three Prisoners own 'd to me in Newgate , that they and two others were concerned in the Scrape . The Jury found 'em Guilty to the Value of 39 s. each . John Robins , Val .

Samuel Atkins . Last Sunday Night , coming from Hampstead I was attack 'd by 5 or 6 Men , in the middle of the first Field from the Turnpike going to Pancras . The first clap 'd a Pistol to my Breast , and the other surrounded me . They took 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d. out of my Pocket , and my Hat . and left me . It was very dark , and I can not swear to any of them . William Norman . On Sunday Night last , the five Prisoners and I were drinking at Mr. Rhodes 's , at the Goat in Black-Boy Alley , Chick lane . We all went out together between 8 and 9 towards Gray 's Inn-lane Turnpike , and went up in the middle of the Path ; between the Turnpike and Pancras we met the Prosecutor , John Robins clapt a Pistol to his Breast . Charley and Dangerfield stood by with Sticks in their Hands : Val . Robins took half a Crown and 6 d. from the Prosecutor , and Sarret took his Hat , and then Barret and I went over the next Field , on the right Hand , and the other went a contrary Way . We lay under a Hedge till break of Day , and then went to an Ale-house in Shore ditch ; I forget the Sign . where we drank 3 or 4 Pots of Beer , and eat some Bread and Cheese . From thence between 6 and 7 in the Morning , we went to Arthur and eat some Beans and Bacon , and at 9 , to Mr. Rhodes 's in Black-Boy-Alley . While I was at Skittles there , the Hat was sent to Pawn ; I think John Robins and Charley carried it , and I heard they got 5 s. upon it ; Charley bought a Pistol on the Saturday before at the end of Bartlett 's Buildings ; and then it was that we agreed to go out to Rob the next Day . We had been acquainted some Time before ; but this was the first time of out going out on such an Account . The Prisoner not hearing distinctly , desir 'd that Norman might repeat his Evidence , which he did without varying in any Circumstance . Francis Waker . Last Monday , about 2 in the Afternoon , Mrs. Atley told me , a young Man had been at her House , asked for her Husband , and said he wanted to make himself an Evidence , and that he got from his Companions , but could not stay , for fear they should mistrust , but that he would come again in 3 Hours . I found out Mr. Atley ; we took Dangerfield in Field-Lane , and carried him to an Ale-house in Turn-again-Lane ; he said he hoped we would help to make him an Evidence , and he gave us the Names of all the rest . We carried him to Wood-Street Compter , and then went to look for the others at Mr. Rhodes 's in Chick-Lane . We mist of 'em there , but one Partridge ( an Evidence against Barns and Fink ) who came from Norman between 10 and 11 at Night , told us , that they were taking a Lodging at the 3 Compasses in Tottenham Court-Road . We were going thither , but met them by the Way , near the End of Hatton-Garden , and took John Robins , his Brother Valentine and Barret and Norman , but Country Jo got off . We carried the former three to Dangerfield in Wood-Street Compter ; but Norman being an Evidence , it was thought proper to put him in the Poultry Compter ; and in our Way thither , Country Jo past by us . Jo , says Norman what , wo n't ye speak to us ? and so we took him too . When they were carried before Alderman Brocas , and charged with this Robbery , they all fell a crying , and accused Norman . Court . Be as particular as you can about what they said before Sir Richard . Waker . Barret desired to be an Evidence , and said , he was drawn in by Norman , and never was in any such Fact before , Val . Robins said the same , and insisted upon it , that he had offer 'd himself to be an Evidence before Barret . Country Jo said , that he was but just come out of the Country , and was never concerned in any Robbery before he was acquainted with Norman . John Robins said , he was not guilty of any Robbery before he knew Norman ; as for Dangerfield , he desired ( as I said before ) to be made an Evidence as soon as we took him . Barret . I never said so . Dangerfield . Nor I . But what they said , was in relation to stealing the Brass Patterns , of which they were convicted yesterday . Most of Waker 's Evidence was confirm 'd by the Constable . John Claxon . In Paul 's Church-Yard , Barret desir 'd me to call a Constable , and he desired to be made an Evidence as soon as the Constable came . Barret . You told me , that I should be hang 'd if I did not turn Evidence . Claxton . No . When the Constable came , I said , If you know any thing , you may as well speak it as not . The Prisoners in their Defence alledg 'd , that the Witnesses swore against them for the sake of the Reward , and call 'd some to their Reputation . The Jury found them all guilty . Death . 12. Katherine Smith was indicted for privately stealing 9 Yards of Muslin , Value 20 s. the Goods of William Butler in his Shop . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 13 , 14. Eleanor Walker and Martha Bishop were indicted for stealing 3 l. the Money of John Willoughby , June 17 . John Willoughby . I pick 'd up Walker in Fleet-street about 10 a Clock o ' Sunday Night , and went with her to her Room in Hanging Sword-Alley . The other brought up a Flask and a Glass ; I stay 'd 1/4 of an Hour , and then was for going ; but Walker said , I should lie with her first . I said , I would not . Then said Bishop , If you wo n't lie with her . you shall with me ; and so she flung her Arms round my Neck , and fell a buffing on me like any thing . Then Nill Walker unbutton 'd my Breeches , and took hold of what I had , and held it hard with one Hand . While she pick 'd my Pocket with t'other . I cried out , and then she let go her Hold below , and clapt that Hand to my Mouth , and the other Hand she reach 'd out to Bishop who presently went away . Then says Nell , what does he make a Noise for , I have got but 2 Pence , and that 's for the Maid . I went toward the Door , and presently the Landlady came to me , and swore at me , and bid me go about my Business . There were 2 men going by the Door , who help 'd me to a Constable , and we found one of the Prisoners about 2 a Clock o ' Sunday Morning , and the other about 3 ; and on Monday they were carried before the Justice , and then they said they had but 8 Pence from me , but I lost 3 Pounds . Nell Walker . This Fellow came by my Door , and forced me in to drink a Dram ; he said he had but 14 d. about him , but if I would trust to his Honour , and oblige him , he would call again , and give me half a Crown . I told him , I never did such things upon Trust , for it was my way to deal with none but Gentlemen that could make me a-handsome Present . Then he would have had Bishop to have Pawn 'd his Waistcoat ; but she told him it was worth nothing . And as I 'm a Christian , we got no more out of him than 2 Groats , tho ' he swears he lost 3 l. But he 's an Irishman , God bless him ; I consider his Country , and know he will swear any thing . I was forc 'd to go to the Ale-house to borrow 6 d. to give him , before he would trust me with his Shilling . He told us he liv 'd in Play-House-Yard in Drury-Lane . The Jury acquitted them . 15 , 16. James Emerton , and Frances his Wife , and Frances his Wife of St. Sepulchers were indicted for assaulting ( with Mary Sadler not yet taken ) Robert Dawcett in the said James Emerton 's House , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , a pair of Silver Buckles , a Hat , and other Goods , and 20 s. in Money , May 30 . Robert Dawcett . I met the Prisoner and another Woman in Long Lane and asked them for a Lodging . Frances Emerton . Do n't you damn your Soul too much you Dog ! is it fit that any Rogue should knock my Teeth out ? and now you want to swear my Life away and my Husband 's too . Dowatt . And so they picked me up , and carry 'd me to the Prisoner 's Lodging . I must needs say I was a little in for't F. E. I wo n't be tried , I wo n't speak one Word till my Husband is clear 'd , I wo n't , I wo n't , [ she stamps about till her Cap falls off ] No , I wo n't put my Cap on . He 's a Rogue . D. and so I say they took me to the White Horse in Chick Lane . and there , as soon as I laid my self upon the Bed , they stript me by main Force , and took away my Money and my Watch . F. E. Ah you Dog ! I wish I was a Man for your Sake . D. And then one said to t'other . Let 's murder him . F. E. You lie , Sirrah , you lie , you Hang-in-Chains Rogue . D. So I got up to run away , but the other Prisoner ( her Husband ) stopt me at the Door , and took hold of my Collar . I heard the Watch go by past 12 a Clock , and I cry 'd out Murder , for God 's sake help . And so with much a do I forc 'd my Way out , and run naked into the Street . F. E. O you damnation Rogue . D. Next Morning he offer 'd to make it up with me , and said , I should have my Watch and every thing again , if I would but be easy . Robert Price Watchman . As I was beating the Hour of 12 , I saw the Prosecutor as naked as ever he was born , except his Shirt , and he told me he was Robb 'd . Frances Emerton . Here 's another Hang-in-Chains Son of a B - ; ar n't you asham 'd of yourself you Rogue ? Price . And he run up the Alley as far as Church-lane . F. Emerton . You lie you Dog . Price . I went into the Room that the Prosecutor came out of , and the Prisoner James Emerton was standing leaning upon a Table , and the Prosecutor 's Clothes lay in the Room by him , and we found every thing but his Watch and his Buckles . James Emerton . I never saw the Prosecutor in my Life before . Frances Emerton . I and another Woman met this Man in g lane and I saw his Eye was cut and I asked him how it came , and he said by quarrelling with a Man in Morefields . So we went into a Shop for a Quartern of Gin to wash his Eye ; and when I had wash 'd it with the Gin , I made Water and wash 'd it with that too . And so says he to th'other Woman , shall I go home with you ? and she said yes ; and so I went with 'em . They 2 went to bed together ; and by and by my Husband comes home dead drunk , at which this Fellow was frighted , and so got out of Bed , and call 'd the Watch , because I wou 'd not lie with him as well as t'other Woman . And he has sent a Man to New Prison for cutting his Eye , and now he swears it to my Husband , and he 's a vile Rogue for his Pains ; and Will . Balt a Runner of Newgate knock 'd this Tooth out of my Head , for which I have got Alderman Brocas 's Warrant against him . Dear Gentlemen , take it into Consideration ; do what you will with me , let all Punishment be due to me , but clear my Husband ; do n't hang him whatever you do .

Eaton asked me to lye there , but I refusing , she and I and the Prisoner took the same Coach , and drove to the Greyhound-Inn in Drury-Lane . We went up Stairs , and had two Pints of Wine , and then Eaton and I went to Bed , and the Prisoner went down . I knock 'd so a Bottle of Water , the Prisoner brought it up , and said she would come to Bed too , and lye with me all Night . I suspecting she had some Design , got up , and put on my Breeches , took the Money out of my Pocket , and counting it , parted the Gold from the Silver , and put the Gold , which was two Guineas and a half , a Broad-piece and a Moidore , into my Right-side Pocket , and thrust my Handkerchief down upon it . Then I laid down ( not in , but ) on the Bed , and the Prisoner with her Cloaths on lay by me . I fell asleep , and between 4 and 5 in the Morning I felt her Hand . I catch 'd hold of her Hand , and ask 'd her what Business she had with it in my Pocket ? But she got her Hand away , and told me that it was not there . I did not search her then , for feeling on the out-side of my Pocket , I felt some Money within , so that I thought my Gold was safe ; but in a Quarter of an Hour Eaton got up , and they were both going away in a Hurry . This gave me a Suspicion , and so searching my Pocket within-side , I found only 2 Shillings , and 2 Sixpences , instead of my Gold : I tax 'd 'em with it , and they both owned they had got my Money ( but not how much ) and said , they would keep it , except I would give 'em two Guineas of it , and then they would return the rest . Court . Did they say how they got it ? G. A . No . I sent for a Constable . Eaton was very outrageous , and broke the Door to get away before the Constable came , but the Landlord prevented her . We all went to the Constable 's House , and there Moll Harvey came and made a Riot , and so Bell Eaton escaped . The Prisoner produced all my Money to the Constable , and said she had it of me , but that I gave it her to lye with her . Prisoner . Had you no more Gold about you , than what you charge me with ? G. A . No , Sral Gra . I live at the Greyhound-Inn . The Prisoner and Bll Eaton , and this little Gentleman , came in a Coach , and asked for a Bed . Says my Mistress , Do n't ye want two Beds ? No , Madam , says the Prisoner , but I hope it will be no Offence to go up , and take Part of a Pint with my Friend , and this Gentleman . The Gentleman pull 'd out some Gold and Silver , and paid for his Bed , and a Pint of Wine , and so they all went up together . When that Pint was out , says the Prisoner ; We will have my Pint now . And so it was brought up . Says Eaton to the Prisoner , I am sure the Gentleman is more generous than to let you pay for it . So the Gentleman paid . I left 'em , and the Prisoner came down soon after . Madam , says she to my Mistress , ca n't I drink a Pint of Wine with you ? Yes , and welcome , says my Mistress . Then the Prisoner sent a Porter for her Husband ( as she call 'd him ) who came directly . They sat down together in the Kitchen , and call 'd for another Pint . By-and-by I heard the Gentleman knocking above Stairs . I ran up and asked him what he knock 'd for ? He said , for a Bottle of Water . I came down and filled a Bottle , but the Prisoner snatch 'd it from me , and carried it up herself , and lock 'd the Door . Go up , saysmy Mistress to me , and see why she stays ; and tell her that I will never suffer such Doings , as for two Women to lye with one Man , for it is not the Practice of my House . I went up to the Door , and told the Prisoner my Mistress wonder 'd she staid so long . Damn ye , says she , I 'm a-bed . Says I , Your Husband wants ye . Let him go Home about his Business , says she , for I tell ye , I am a-bed , and wo n't come . With that the Gentleman open 'd the Door , and said , Young Woman , what d 'ye want . I told him , my Mistress would not suffer such Things , as two Women to one Man . Then he took some Gold in his Hand , and look 'd at it by the Candle , and put it into his Side-pocket ; and I went down and told my Mistress , that I thought they design 'd to rob him . Says my Mistress , I never was served in this Manner by two Women before . I 'll sit up all Night , but I 'll see whether or no a Gentleman shall be robb 'd in my House . The Prisoner 's Husband said nothing to this , but got up and went away . About 5 in the Morning my Master was coming down Stairs , the Prisoner and Eaton had open 'd the Chamber-door softly , and were coming out . Hey ! says he , here 's two Woman a creeping away . The Gentleman hearing this , got from the Bed , and they were forced in again . Eaton made a great Disturbance , and would have got out o ' Window , but being prevented , she gave the Gentleman several Slaps o ' the Face . He said , Very well , Madam ! I sha n't strike you . Then she went to break the Lock of the Door with a Candlestick , and at last she split the Door , but they kept her from getting out . The Gentleman said he had been robb 'd , and desired a Constable might be sent for , and a Constable came and carried them all three to his own House . Prisoner . When you came to call me down , and the Gentleman look 'd at his Money by your Candle , did you see any Guineas , or a Moidore , or a Broad-piece in his Hand ? Grant . I saw Gold in his Hand , but I do n't know what Sort . He seem 'd to hold it as if he was counting it , and I bid him take Care of it . Sarah Lamb . I heard a Voice in the Chamber say , We own we have got your Money , but you shall never have it again , except you 'll give us two Guineas . Charles Hays , Constable . John Eland , who keeps the Greyhound-Inn at the Corner of Russel-street in Drury-Lane , came to my House last Saturday Morning about six a Clock , and desired me to come and take the Prisoner , and Eaton , who , he said , were making a Riot , and disturbing his Lodgers . I went thither , the Prosecutor charg 'd them with robbing him of 2 Guineas and a half , a Moidore , and a Broad-piece . The Prisoner shewed me the same Pieces , and said he had given 'em to her to lye with her . I put 'em to their Choice , to go to my House or the Watch-house , till the Justice was up . They all chose my House , and so I took 'em with me . Eaton offer 'd me half a Guinea dry , and half a Guinea to be spent , if I would not carry her before Justice Du Veil ; but when I would not agree to her Terms , she catch 'd up a Case-Knife , and offer 'd to stick me , but I avoided the Blow ; and by-and-by Moll Harvey , with a Mob of I believe an Hundred Pick-pockets , came and made a Riot about my House , and so Eaton escaped . Prisoner . But I never offer 'd to stir ; for I said I had done no Crime , but had got the Money of the Gentleman faitly . He and I have been old Acquaintance . G. A. I never saw her Face before that Night . She said before Justice Dn Veil , that I gave her all my Money in Red-Lion-street . Prisoner . I say so still , and I 'll prove it . The Prisoner 's Defence . Mary Welsh . I live in Short 's Gardens , About a Week ago the Prisoner came to my House to enquire for a Lodging . I told her I wou 'd Lett none under Half a Crown a Week . She said she would call again , and bring her Husband with her , and directed me to enquire her Character at Mr. Soams 's , a Brandy-shop in Red-Lion-street . So o ' Friday Night one came to know if I would let the Prisoner and her Husband lye at my House . I went down to Soams 's , and there was she and this Gentleman . I asked Soams if that Gentleman was her Husband . He said , he did not know that he was . With that I refused to receive 'em , and thereupon the Gentleman pulled some Gold and Silver out of his Pocket , and said to me ; Perhaps you are afraid we have got no Money . Whereof the Prisoner says to him , Now , my Dear , if you 'll give me enough to fetch my Things out of Pawn , I 'll go with you to an Inn . So he gave her some Money , but I do n't know how much . I am sure I came here very much against my Desire , but she sent a Paper to me , and threatened to ruin my Husband ( who is a Cabinet-maker ) if I did not appear for her . Robert Whitney . I was drinking at Soams 's o ' Friday Night , and after 9 , this Gentleman and the Prisoner , and another Woman came in . He called for a Tiff of Punch , and seem 'd very free with the Prisoner , more than with the other Woman . Court . The Prosecutor swears he did not go in at all , but only drank a Dram at the Door . Whitney . No , he came in and drank Punch . And he kiss 'd and embraced the Prisoner very soudly . And then came in a Woman about a Lodging , and as soon as this Woman was gone , says the Prisoner to him ; If you will give me Money to fetch my Cloaths out of Pawn , I 'll go with you to an Inn . The Gentleman gave her some Gold , and she told it out in her Hand : There was a Moidore , a Broad-piece , and 2 Guineas , and a half . She told it out in her Hand , and said , that was not enough . Court . And what did she do with the Money , when she said it was not enough ? Whitney . As she could get no more , she took up with that . Court . How came you to observe the Pieces so particularly ? W. I stood pretty near to her . Court . Did you know her before ? W. No . C. How came she to find you out then ? W. She heard of me at Mr. Soams 's . C. Are you one of his constant Customers ? W. No : But I am one of the same Business ; I have kept a Brandy-shop in Gray's-Inn-Lane above half a Year . We often go to see one another . I drink at his House , and he drinks at mine . I carry Customers to him , and he brings Customers to me ; and so we live very sociably . John Soams . I keep a Brandy-shop in Red-Lion-street . About 10 a Clock o ' Friday Night , the Prisoner and this Gentleman came into my Shop , and drank a Dram a-piece , and then they went and sate behind the Counter , and call 'd for a Tiff of Punch . Says he , We wo n't sit here , let 's go to an Inn . Says she , You have often promised to fetch my Cloaths out of Pawn , And , says he , you sha n't want Money for that . And so he gave her a Moidore and a Guinea . Is this all ? says she . And then he gave her a Broad-piece , and half a Guinea , or a Guinea , I do n't know which . She told him that was not enough ; and then he said , he 'd give her more when they came to the Inn , and so they went away in a Coach . Sarah Grant . This is the very Man that the Prisoner sent for to our House , and he pass 'd for her Husband . And he 's one of Moll Harvey 's Bail . Prisoner . I have no Husband , nor never had . Court . Did you never pass for her Husband ? Was you never reputed to be her Husband ? Soams . No . S. Grant . When he came in , my Mistress said , Is this your Wife ? And he answer 'd , Yes . Court . You seem to be pretty much at her Beck , however . Ann Gines . I went to Soam 's 'so ' Friday Night , between 9 and 10 , and saw the Prisoner and this Gentleman there . She ask 'd him for Money , and he gave her some Gold , and said , My Dear , you shall go to an Inn with me to Night . Jane Boyd . I lodged in the same House as the Prisoner , but one Pair of Stairs above her . About a Fortnight ago , as I was coming down Stairs , she called me in to drink Tea , and this Gentleman was with her , and I heard him promise her some Money . And about a Month ago I saw her go out with him in a Coach . Prisoner . He has promised me Money many a Time ; and this Prosecution is only out of Spite , because I would not go to Bed with him along with Bill Eaton . The Jury found her Guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 19. Mary Loveday , was indicted for stealing a Hat , value 5s . the Goods of James Bladwell , June 10 . Guilty 10d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 20. Sarah Reynolds , was indicted for stealing a Coat and Waistcoat , val . 50s . the Goods of James Galliot , in the House of Peter Gasper Grace , June 9 . Guilty 39s . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 21. John Gladman , of Ickenham , was indicted for stealing a Black Gelding , val . 10 l. the Goods of William Osmond , May 13 . William Osmond . I live in Ickenham Parish , near Uxbridge , the Prisoner was brought up in my Neighbourhood , but he went away from thence 2 or 3 Days before I miss 'd my Horse , which was on the 13th of May . The Horse was taken out of my Field ; in 3 Days after , the Prisoner ( as I heard ) offering to sell the Horse to Mr. Paul of Dartford , was taken up on Suspicion , and committed to Deptsord Bride . II . From thence he sent a Letter to his Father in Ickenham Parish , but there being another Man of the same Name , in the same Parish , the Letter by Mistake came to him , and he acquainted me with the Contents , by which I found out the Prisoner . Mr. Paul . A Farrier in Dartford asking me if I would buy a Horse , I went with him to a little Alehouse where I found the Prisoner and the Horse . Says the Prisoner , I value this Horse at 12 Guineas , but as I am going a Journey , I must have some Horse or other , and therefore , if you have any that will serve my Turn I 'll rap with you . I shew 'd him 2 or 3 , and at last he pitch 'd upon a little serub Horse . We agreed that he should have this little Horse , and 7 Guineas in exchange for the Horse he had to dispose of . I gave him a Shilling Earnest , and then told him , it was the Custom of our Neighbourhood to require Vouchers , when they bought a Horse of a Stranger . He said , He could bring no Vouchers , because he knew no Body thereabouts . I ask 'd him where he liv 'd , and how he came by the Horse ? He said , He liv 'd at Harrow on the Hill , and bought the Horse there ; and that he would not now have sold him , but that he was robb 'd on Bexley-Heath of 3 Guineas and a half , and had not a Shilling left to bear his Charges . On farther Talk , I found he Shuffled , and was in several Stories ; upon which I sent for a Constable . The Prisoner then said , That he knew Mr. Buck in our Neighbourhood , to whom he sold a Horse a Year ago . I remember 'd that Mr. Buck about that time , did buy a Horse of a Stranger , who said , He had been robb 'd on Bristol-Causeway ; and it afterwards appear 'd , that that Horse was stol'n . We carried the Prisoner before the Justice , who having examin 'd him , committed him to Deptford-Bridewell . William Rundal . As soon as the Prosecutor saw the Horse at Mr. Paul 's , he own 'd him , and took him away . James Taibot . I know that Horse to be the Prosecutor 's . He 's a black Cart Gelding , I have drove him 3 Quarters of a Year . Prisoner . One John Brocks a Farmer , at Maidenhead , met me on the Road between Kensington and London , and gave me half a Guinea to sell the Horse for him at Rochester-Fair , and I was to meet him the Friday following , at the Cock in the Hay-Market . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 22. John Gillet , alias Mouth , was indicted for assaulting John Maxey , on the Highway , in the Parish of St. Dionis Back-Church , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Hat , val . 8s . and a Wig , val . 2s . 6d . April 9 . John Maxey . On the 9th of April , between 9 and 10 at Night , as I was going along Lime Street , I saw the Prisoner , and John Crouch * , ( who was convicted last Sessions ) standing at Pewterer 's Hall-Gate . I looked at them , and did not like them , they follow 'd me , I turn 'd about at the Rummer Tavern-Door , and saw both their Faces plainly by the Lamp . When I came into Cullum-street , the Prisoner bid me stand , and Crouch bid me deliver . The Prisoner put a Handkerchief to my Mouth , and Crouch shook my Breeches , and finding nothing in them , he took my Hat and Wig , and went off ; but perceiving that Crouch did not follow him , he turn 'd back and said to him , Danm you , why do n't you come along . Says Crouch , He holds me ; with that the Prisoner came up and stabb 'd me in the Hand to make me let go , by which means they both got off . The Prisoner was taken in Rosemary-Lane last Monday by Mr. Harris , to whom I had described him the Day before . * See the Tryal of Crouch , alias Yarmouth , in the last Sessions-Paper , p. 139. Nathaniel Harris . As soon as I had open 'd my Door o ' Monday Morning , I saw the Prisoner go by , and finding he answer 'd the Prosecutor 's Description , I call 'd to him ; he turn 'd back , and damn 'd me , and made off , but I follow 'd and took him . He was taken some time ago , on an Information for robbing a Man in Bishopsgate-Street . Prisoner . I never saw the Prosecutor in my Life , nor never was in Crouch 's Company but 2 or 3 times , and Crouch will say the same if you send for him from Newgate . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 23. Daniel Tipping , was indicted for assaulting ( with * James Plumridge , not yet taken ) Joshua Lumm in a Field , near the Highway , in the Parish of Stepney , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Cloth-Coat , value 3 l. a Hat , val . 10 s. a Wig , val . 40. a Silk Handkerchief , and 19 s. in Money . * Plumridge was an Evidence against Cole and Pain who were capitally Convicted in Doceer last , see his Tryal in the Session-Paper , Numb . I. Pag . 13 . At the Prisoner 's Desire the Witnesses against him were examin 'd a-part . Joshua Lumm . I live with Alderman Parsons : On Sunday , June 18th near 11 at Night , I was attack 'd by 3 Men in Stepney-Fields , one of them collar 'd me , and tore my Shirt out of the Gathers ; I ask 'd him what he wanted , and gave him a push from me ; he cut me across the Throat with a Knife , and said , Damn ye , I 'll tell you what I want ; the other two then came behind me , and struck me on the Head with Broomsticks , Damn ye , says the first , come out of the Pathway , and with that they dragg 'd me 30 or 40 Yards aside ; stabb 'd me twice in the Back , took off my Hat and Wig , and leaning me against a Bank , took 19 s. and a little piece of Span sh Silver , worth about 4 d. halfpenny out of my Breeches-Pocket , but they left 6 d. behind ; then they pull 'd my Coat off , my Handkerchief and Gloves were in the Coat-Pocket ; they gave me several Knocks with Broomsticks to knock me down , and at last they did ; I held up my Hand as long as I could to defend my self ; my Arm was very much swell 'd next Day with the Blows : After they had got me down , they cut my Wrist , my Nose , and my Ears , and gave me several other Cuts in the Head and Face , and then they threatened to tie me Neck and Heels , but did not do it ; and as they were going , one of them listed me up , and bid me run if I could , and then they made off , and I went to Dr. Harrison 's to get my Wounds drest , they are not well yet . The Prisoner was taken on the Information of Peter Buck ; it was dark , and I ca n't swear that he was one of those that robb 'd me . Peter Buck . The Prisoner and I , and Plumridge committed this Robbery : The Prisoner and I din 'd at Mr. Winniat 's in Fleet-Lane , on Sunday was a Fortnight ; we had a Leg of Mutton and Turnips for Dinner , and 3 Bowls of Punch after , in Company with Winniat and his Man , and a Countryman ; but Winniat is since absconded . Between 9 and o at Night Plumridge came in , and ask 'd us to drink a Dram ; we had half a Pint of Caraway , and then went all together to Whitechappel-Fields ; there we overtook the Prosecutor : Plumridge seiz 'd him , and cut him across the Throat , and gave him 2 Stabs in the Back with a great Case-knife , which he brought from Winniat 's : I did not see him give the Stabs , but he told me afterwards that he did it . Then the Prisoner struck him on the Head with a Broomstick , and the Prosecutor being 10 th to come along , we dragg 'd him to a Bankside ; Plumridge got upon the Bank to pull him over , but did not ; I search 'd his Pocket , and took out 19 s. and the Prisoner examin 'd farther , and found the Pocket-Piece , 't was a little bit of Silver like a Sixpence : I took his Hat , and gave him mine . Lumm . I know of no Hat that was given me . Buck . He was senseless with the Blows and Wounds : This is the Hat , and Plumridge took his Wig to the best of my Remembrance , tho ' the Prisoner since told me , that he took it himself . We stript his Coat off , and the Prisoner bid me put it on and wear it , which I did ; but first they knock 'd him down , and would have murder 'd him if I had not begg 'd his Life . How can ye serve a Man so villainously ? says I , sure you will not be such vile Men as to kill him ! For God 's Sake spare his Life . And so as they were going I listed him up , and bid him run for his Life ; upon which Plumridge and the Prisoner turn 'd back to kill me , but I made 'em easy . This is the Coat , and here are the 2 Cuts in the Back . Then we came on foot to Newgate-street , and there we took Coach between 12 and 1 in the Morning , and drove to Mr. Pember 's , at the Pindar of Wake-field , where we all three went to bed together . Pember married one of my Sisters . Next Day we went to the Two Brewers by the Church in Old Bedlam , where we spent most of the Money , and at Night I and Plumridge went to Cow-Cross , where we pawn 'd the Coat for 7 s. and from thence to Ralph Dohson 's in the Old Bailey , where we met the Prisoner , and spent the Night together . I voluntarily surrender 'd myself to Justice Rohe the same Week ( but I forget the Day ) and gave Information against the Prisoner , who was taken immediately ; then I went , and 3 Men with me , to see for Plumridge in Old Bedlam , but he was gone before we came ; and after that I went by myself to New Prison . Court . Was there not a Warrant out against you before you surrender 'd ? Buck . The Prisoner told me there was a Judge 's Warrant against me , but I knew nothing of it ; I surrender 'd upon no other Account than the Pricks of Conscience . Court . How happened it then that you did not surrender sooner ? Buck . I went about it as soon as ever I could get out of the Prisoner 's Company without his suspecting me ; I left him under Pretence of going to have my Wig powder 'd , and I told Mr . Pointing and some other Men of this Robbery , and desired them to go with me to a Justice to surrender myself . Court . How long have you known the Prisoner and Plumridge ? Buck . I have known the Prisoner 5 Weeks , and Plumridge 10 Months ; the Prisoner and I became acquainted at Mr. Rhodes 's Alehouse in Black-Boy-Alley ; he told me that he was a Poulterer , and he and Plumridge invited me to go out with 'em . Prisoner . Pray , my Lord , enquire into his Character . Buck . My Character ! I am well enough known , I have liv 'd at the Man and Moon Tavern in Whitechappel , at Madam Lawley 's at Aldgate , at Mr. Hare 's at the Horns , and at several other Places : And then I used to go out with Mules and Asses of my own to sell Earthen-ware , till within these 3 Quarters of a Year , not being very well , I have been with my Sister in Black-Boy-Alley . Prisoner . One of his Sisters is now in Newgate for picking a Gentleman 's Pocket * . * The Bill was found Ignoramus . Buck . One of my Sisters kept a Brandy shop , and t'other kept an Alehouse at the Pindar of Wakefield , but they have both met with Losses , and so have left off Trade . Ralph Dobson . I live in the Old Baily , I am a Cooper by Trade , and sell Liquors and Earthen-ware , Buck , and Plumridge , and the Prisoner were drinking together at my House last Monday was a Fortnight , between 11 and 12 at Night ; they had a Bottle of Dorcheste Beer , and a Bottle of Perry . William Pomber . I lately kept the B Tree Alehouse at the Pindar of Wakefield , but have since left it . On Monday the 19th of April , about one in the Morning , Buck , and Plumridge , and the Prisoner came in a Coach to my Door , and knock 'd me up ; I told 'em I had no Fire , nor Candle in the House ; they said they were very dry ; says I to Buck , You know the way into the Cellar , fetch up some bottle Ale ; so he went down , and brought up 3 Bottles . I groped about for a Mug , but not finding it readily , they drank out of the Bottle ; then they all 3 went to the Pump to wash themselves ; I went up to Bed , and they follow 'd me ; my Wife was not with me , and so we lay all together , for it was a very large Bed . I got up at 5 , and opening the Window-shutter , saw their Cloaths which lay on the Bed , and their Linen were very bloody : Plumridge call 'd for some Water , and a Towel , which I fetch 'd , and he began to wash one of the Coats , which was more bloody than the rest ; says I you 'll spoil your Coat , you had better do it with a dry Brush ; he desir 'd me to help him to one , which I did , and then he began to rub the Blood off his own Coat , for he said the other was Buck 's , and when he had done , the Prisoner took the Brush , and clean 'd his Coat . Says the Prisoner to Buck , You ca n't go to London in that Coat , in such a pickle : No , says he , I 'll go in my Waistcoat , and leave the Coat here till dry . I ask 'd 'em how they came in that bloody Condition , and how the Coat came to be cut Why , says the Prisoner , I was playing Rogue with a Penknife , and cut it myself last Night , and afterwards we all got drunk , and fell to fighting . They went to London , Buck being in his Waistcoat , and about 9 at Night they return 'd , and ask 'd for the Coat ; I gave it 'em , and went out my self , and left them there , so that I do n't know how long they staid . On Tuesday the Prisoner and Buck came to my House again , and ask 'd me if I knew that Fellow Plumridge : I told them no , I had never seen him before . Why , said they , he 's taken up , and put into the Compter , and we have been fighting with the Watch to rescue him , but we could not manage it ; for at last we were glad to get away overselves . Now we are afraid that he should take himself an Evidence , and wish you would go to London , and enquire whether it is so , or not . Court . Did they name any particular Fact , concerning which they were afraid he should turn Evidence ? Pember . No . I went to London and heard that a Man had been robb 'd in Stepney Fields of a Coat , and Hat and Wig , and had been very much abused . This made me suspicious of these three Men ; and so that Night I went to look for Buck and the Prisoner at a House in Drury-Lane , which I knew they frequented . They both came in drunk between 12 and 1 in the Morning . They stay 'd some Time , and then I went away with them towards my House . When we came into the Fields , they quarrel 'd about the Coat that Buck and Plumridge had pawn 'd at Cow-Cross ; they swore and curs 'd , and called Names ; you 're as great a Rogne as I , says one , and you have no Heart , says th'other ; and at last they drew their Knives , but the Prisoner wrested Buck 's Knife out of his Hand , and threw it away ; Buck sell into a dry Ditch , and there we left him without a Coat . As the Prisoner and I went home together , he told me . that himself and Buck and Plumridge had robb 'd a Man , and stabb 'd him in the Back , because he was resolute , and wou 'd not agree to their Compliance . When we came to my House , I turned my Wife and another out of Bed , and I and the Prisoner went in . Buck came Home soon after , tho ' he would not come to Bed because of the Quarrel , but he sat up with his Sister . Court . Was she your Wife ? Pember . Yes , and a good one too she wou 'd be , if she was but hang 'd . I got up in the Morning , and Buck then went to Bed . I went to London , and consulted with Mr. Brock , Mr. James and Mr . Pointing , and they spoke to Mr. Taylor about apprehending the Prisoner and Buck . We all came for that Purpose to my House ; but my Wife suspecting my Design , had given her Brother and the Prisoner timely Notice , so that they got off . Then I appointed to meet Mr. Taylor and Mr. James in London at 6 that Afternoon , and to go to Sir Richard Brocas to detain Plumridge , who was then in the Compter . I and Pointing waited at several House in the Fields , in hopes of catching Buck and the Prisoner , if they came that Way ; but we mist of them , tho ' we stay 'd till 8 a Clock ; and so when we came to London . Mr. Taylor was gone , and Plumridge was discharged . Then we went to Drury lane , to enquire after the other two , and hearing that two Street Robbers had been taken up , and sent to the Round-house ; we went thither , but found two other Men there , who had endeavour 'd to take the Prisoner and Buck ; but a Mob being rais 'd by that Attempt , those 2 were committed for breeding a Riot . Next Day being Thursday . I went that Way again , and happening to see Buck 's eldest Sister , who lodg 'd in Drury-lane , I dog 'd her to the White-Hart in * Baldwin 's Gardens in Drury-lane , and there I found the Prisoner drinking ; I sat down and talk 'd , and play 'd at Cards with him . He express 'd some uneasiness that Buck stay 'd so long ; for Buck was gone out under Pretence to get his Wig powder 'd . At last the Prisoner got up to go away . But one Mr. How stopp 'd him . The Prisoner asked the Reason . Why , says Mr. How , I have got a Writ against you for 9 l. which you owe your Father-in-Law Thorowton Bocklingson for Board . O , says the Prisoner , if that 's all , I do n't mind that , and so he sat down again , and sung us a Song or two ; after which a Coach was call 'd , under Pretence of driving him to his Father-in-Law 's in Rose-street ; but by the Way we was met by Richard Pointing and a Constable , who charg 'd the Prisoner with a Street Robbery on the Information of Buck . The Prisoner turn 'd as Pale as Death , and only said , Sure Peter Buck would never serve me so . The Prisoner was then carried before Mr. Justice Robe at the Red Cross in Holborn , but he made no Confession . * Short 's Gardens . Richard Pointing . I saw the Prisoner with Pember and How in a Coach in Drury-lane . I followed the Coach , and seeing them go into the 2 Sugar-Loaves Ale-house I went after them and charged the Prisoner with a Warrant on Buck 's Information . Thomas How . Pointing told me , that Buck had informed against the Prisoner , and that the Prisoner would be at the White-Horse in Short 's Gardens ( not Ba'dwin 's Gardens ) in Drury lane : I went thither , and found him and Buck and Pember with Buck 's Sister . I went and sat in another Box at first , and took no Notice of them . Buck made an Excuse to go out and get his Wig powder 'd , and his Sister said . she was a hungry , and would go out and get a Pigeon Pye , or some such Thing ; and so Pember and the Prisoner were left together , and they play 'd a Game or 2 at Cards . After which the Prisoner got up and went to the Door , and wondred that Buck stay 'd so long ; he sat down again , but seem 'd very uneasy . and got up a second time ; upon which I took hold of him ; he appeared much concern 'd at it , and asked me what was the Matter ? I told him , I had a Warrant against him for 9 l. due to his Father-in-Law for Board . He desired me to stay till Buck came back . I stay 'd some Time ; for I did not then know where Buck was gone to ; but not coming I call 'd a Coach , under Pretence of carrying the Prisoner to his Father 's , for we were afraid of raising a Mob if it had been known that he was taken for a Street Robber . We had gone but a little Way before I saw Pointing following the Coach , and came to us in 3 or 4 Minutes . Richard Hutson . I am Servant to Mr. Winniat in Fleet-lane ; the Prisoner was there on the Day after the Robbery . Court . How do you know it was the Day after ? Hudson . Because then I heard Buck say , We robb 'd Man yesterday of his Hat and Coat , and this Wig . C. Why , was Buck mad to speak of such a Thing publickly ? H. He spoke it in a vapoueing way . C. Did the Prisoner hear him ? H. I believe the Prisoner was not there then . Did not the Prisoner and Buck dine there on the Sunday ? H. Yes , I think they came in about 2 a Clock , but I can not be very positive , for I had lived at Mr. Winniat 's but 3 or 4 Days at that Time . C. Did you carry in any Punch after Dinner ? H. Yes , 2 Bowls . C. Did they eat together ? H. Yes , c. And drink together ? H. They were in the same Room . C. That 's not the Question . H. I do n't know that the Prisoner drank , I was to and again in the Shop . C. You shuffle ! did they belong to one Company ? H. To my thinking they did . C. Was any other Person in their Company ? H. Another came in after Dinner , and I believe drank with them . C. How long did they stay ? H. Till between 10 and 11 at Night . c. Did they go away both together ? H. I think so . c. Do you know Plumridge ? Did the third Man drink Punch with them ? H. They two went away about 9 and came again between 10 and 11 , and another Man was with them ; our Shop was then shut up , and they desired me to let them have half a Pint of Carraway , and said they would stay no longer than just to drink it ; for they were going to take a Walk out . C. And could not you have said this at first , without shuffling ? Where is your Master ? H. Gone into the Country . C. When did he go ? H. Last Sunday Night . C. And when do you expect him again ? H. His Sister told me she had a Letter from him , and expected him next Monday Night . Council . My Lord , here are 3 other Witnesses , who apprehended Buck and the Prisoner , the Night before Buck surender 'd himself . Anthony Fathwall . The last Witness Richard Hudson informed us , that Buck and the Prisoner had committed a Robbery , upon which we went on Wednesday Night to an Alehouse in Drury-Lane , and took 'em both . But Buck 's Sister , who was there present , went out and fetched one Brock , who came with others and beat us , and threw the Pots at us ; so that Buck and the Prisoner got off , and the next Day Buck turned Evidence . Will . Pember again . Buck 's Sister told me , that he went on Wednesday Night to Captain Giffard 's , to be made an Evidence , but it was so late ( being about 12 a Clock ) that it could not be done that Night . Harry Pierce . On Wednesday Night we took Buck and the Prisoner at the Scotch Arms in Drury-Lane . I had Buck in my Hands , when his Sister and Brock the Bailist , and some others rushed in and rescued them before we could get a Constable . They raised a Mob , and sell to sighting , and then charged us with breeding a Riot , and so we were sent to the Roundhouse . Benjamin Bennet . We were informed by John Davis , that 2 Street-Robbers were at the Scotch Arms . We went in and seized them , and Brock and his Gang came and rescued 'em about 12 at Night . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . I own I have been so unfortunate as to drink in Buck 's Company , but I was not with him that Night the Robbery was committed . Buck and Pember both are Persons of the vilest Character . Mr. Jones , the City-Marshal . I have frequently found Buck in ill House , such as Debson 's in the Old-Bailey , and I have often warn 'd him to keep away , if he did not intend to come to the Gallows . Pember 's Wife is as bad as can be ; she 's now in Newgate , and at present Pember himself has no visible Way of Livelihood . Brock and James make it their Business to take Rogues . John Prickmore . I have known Pember from a Child , and I never heard no I 'll of him in my Life of my own Knowledge , any further than that he lives with his Wife . Buck . The Prisoner was in Barnet Finks and Yates 's Information . Then the Prisoner called Witnesses to his Character . John Lester . I knew the Prisoner when he was ' Prentice , and since . He 's a Poulterer by Trade . And since he has been out of his Time , he has fed Ducks at his Father-in-Law 's , and sold 'em again to the Trade . I have heard no ill Character of him ; and his Father-in-Law keeps an Alehouse in Rose-street in Newgate-market , and lives in good Repute . William Lawman . The Prisoner was my Apprentice . I have trusted him with Hundreds of Pounds , and never found that he wrong 'd me of a Farthing . He always had a very honest Character . I have bought Ducks of him within these three Weeks ; and if he were at Liberty again , I would trust : him to carry 100 l. for me , as soon as any Man I know . Richard Hutton . My Wife being ill in February and March last , I took the Prisoner to assist me during her Illness , and have often trusted him to receive and pay 30 , 40 , or 50 l. at a Time , and to keep my Books , and found him always very honest . Thorowton Pocklington . I have known the Prisoner these 18 Years . I am his Father-in-Law . I let him have Money to buy Ducks , which he fatted up and sold again . I never denied him Money when he wanted it , so that I am sure he had no Occasion to rob for it . I have trusted him with Money , and left him in Charge with my House , and I never knew that he wrong 'd me . A great many more of the Prisoner 's Neighbours appeared in his behalf , and gave him a very good Character . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 24.

Margaret Fache of St. Sepulchers , was indicted for Privately stealing an Elephant 's Tooth , Value 12 s. 6 d. the Goods of John Smith , in his Shop , June 6 . Oliver Smith . My Father having lost 4 Elephants Teeth , and the Prisoner using our Shop , I suspected her , and laid a Bait to catch her . I chalked the uppermost Row of Teeth with 1 , 2 , 3 , to 8 . Between 9 and 10 at Night , she came with Mary and Ann Alexander to buy a Length of Cocos Wood . I saw the Prisoner take one of the Teeth and put under her Petticoats . I let her go out , and then followed and brought her back , and she took the Tooth from under her Coats , and threw it down in the Shop , and Richard Can took it up ; and then she said she was but in Just . Prisoner . Did not I strike you with the Tooth ? Smith . No . Prisoner . Did not you pull your Breeches down ? Smith . No . Prisoner . Did not you lock the Door upon me , when the two young Women went out ? Smith . No . Court . Did you serve the Prisoner in the Shop ? Smith . Yes , the 2 young Women went backward to chuse a Piece of Wood , and I saw 'd it off for them in the Shop . and then I let them out , and the Prisoner followed them as far as next Door . Court . What Size was the Tooth ? Smith . Here it is , it weighs 10 l. and an half . Court . How did she walk ? Smith . She walked well enough , but I suppose she had some private Place to put it in , for I saw it come from her . Court . And you said you saw her put it under her Coats ? S. No . I mist it from the Heap , and see her take it , but I did not see her put it under her Coats , but I knew she had it , but I did not see it . C. How did you know it then ? S. Because she stole 4 more some Time ago . c. And how do ye know that ? S. Know it ? I ca n't say I know it , I only fancy so : But I lost them , and it must be she that took them ; for how shou 'd they be gone else ? c. Why did not you charge the other two Women ? S. I did charge them , but Alderman Brocas discharged them , because I fix 'd it upon none but the Prisoner . Richard Cane . I was drinking at the next Door , and Smith followed the Prisoner and the other 2 Women , and felt about their Petticoats ; he said he did not know which of them had got it ; and when the Prisoner went into the Shop again , she dropt it on the Ground , and own 'd that she took it , but said it was only in left . Says I , this is a pretty Thing for a Woman to carry bet wixt her Legs . Prisoner . My Father is a Fan-Stick Maker , and dealt with Mr. Smith , who was always very impudent when I went to the Shop : I was sent thither for a Piece of Cocos Wood ; and being afraid to go alone , I desired Mary and Ann Alexander to go with me . As soon as we came in he shut the Door ; he took us backwards to chuse the Wood , and then he brought it into the Shop to saw it . He was very rude . and offer 'd to put his Hands under my Coats while they were there , and talk 'd a deal of impudent stuff . The 2 young Women open 'd the Door and got out and I was going with them , but he pull 'd me back . and tore my Gown , and push 'd the Door too . Then he threw me on the Ground . I cry 'd out , and he clapt his Hand to my Mouth , but I got up again , and took one of the Teeth up and struck him with it , and then I got the Door open , and run out ; he followed me , and said I had robb 'd him . Mary Alexander . The Prisoner call 'd at our House , and desired my Mother to let me and my Sister go with her , for she said , that Smith was always impudent when she went alone , but might not be so if we were there . so we went with her : and found Smith sitting at the Door , and the Door open ; but as soon as we came in he shut it . We went backwards with her to look out the Wood ; he soon began his impudent Tricks , and went to put his Hands under her Coats for all we were there . Then he brought the Wood into the Shop and saw 'd it , and she paid him 8 d. for it ; and all the while he kept talking his impudent lewd Discourse about lying with her , and where would be the harm of it if he did , and such kind of Stuff , but all in such gross Language , that I can not repeat it . I and my Sister got out first , and were gone but a little Way from the Door , when we heard her scream out , and call Molly , Molly . We turn 'd back , and he said she had taken the Tooth , and he would swear it , and we shall all stay till the Watch was set ; tho ' says he , if she had not made such a Noise and Shrieking , I never would have charged her with it . The Evidence of Ann Alexander was the same in Effect as her Sister 's . Charles Kemp . I have known the Prisoner above 16 Years , and I believe her to be as sober , as modest , and as honest a Girl as lives upon Earth ; I bail 'd her upon this Affair , as believing the Prosecution to be base and malicious ; and I would now engage 500 l. for her Honesty . I believe her Father has dealt with these very People for 1000 l. Several other Witnesses appear 'd to her Character . The Jury acquitted her , and the Court order 'd her a Copy of her Indictment . 34 , 35 John Wilson , and Sarah his Wife , and Sarah his Wife , were indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , the Goods of William Kingsley , in his House , June 26 . Acquitted . 36. Mary Nugent , of Stepney , was indicted for robbing Susan Tims on the Highway of 6 Guineas , the Money of Henry Hargrave , May 27 . Acquitted . 37.

John Cooper . On Whit-Monday , May 29 . I dress 'd myself and went abroad , and returning between 1 and 2 next Morning to my Lodging at Numb . 11 in Eagle-Court , in the Strand , I knock 'd once , but finding no Body answer 'd , I went to a Night-Cellar hard by , I call 'd for a Pint of Beer , and sitting down on a Bench , the Prisoner came and sat by me ; he ask 'd me if I did not know Mr. Price , and some other Persons , and so we sell into Discourse ; we drank 3 hot Pints together , I paid the Reckoning 9 1/3 d. and went up ; I was got about 15 or 20 Yards off when the Prisoner came up to me , said it was a fine Morning , and ask 'd me to take a Walk ; I agreed , and we went into Chelsea Fields , and turning up to a private Place among some Trees , he clap 'd his left Hand to the right Side of my Coat , and trip 'd up my Heels , and holding a Knife to me , God damn ye says he , if ye offer to speak or stir I 'll kill ye ; give me your Ring . I gave it him , and he put it on his own Finger ; then he made me pull of my Coat and Waistcoat , and Breeches ; I begg 'd that he would not kill me , nor leave me naked ; No , says he , I 'll only change wi'ye ; came pull off your Shirt , and put on mine ; so he stript , and drest himself in my Cloaths , and I put on his ; there was 4 1/2 d. in my Breeches , and I found 3 ha ' pence in his . He ask 'd me where I liv 'd , and I told him . I suppose , says he , you intend to charge me with a Robbery by and by , but if you do , I 'll swear you 're a Sodomite , and gave me the Cloaths to let you B - r me . While we were dressing , a Man pass 'd by at a little Distance , if there had been 2 Men I should have ventur 'd to have call 'd to them for Help , but as there was but one I was afraid . Then the Prisoner bid me come along , and I follow 'd him to Piccadilly , and so to Little Windmill-street , and there I call 'd to 2 Men , who took him into an Alehouse ; I told them he had robb 'd me , and he said that I had given him the Cloaths to let me B - him . The Men said they expected to be paid for their Day 's Work , if they lost their Time about my Business ; I promis 'd them they should be satisfied . When we came to Justice Mercer 's , he was not up , so we went to the Coach and Horses by St. Giles 's Church , and waited an Hour and an half ; while we were there the Prisoner wrote a Letter ; to his Mother ( as he said ) and directed it to Numb . 20. in Colston's-Court in Drury-Lane . We went before the Justice , who ask 'd me if I had charg 'd a Constable with the Prisoner , I told him no ; Go and do it then , says the Justice , and swear to the Things , and I 'll commit him . So we went toward Tyburn-Road , into Marybone-Fields , and there the Men let the Prisoner go ; What do ye do ? says I . Why what would you have us do , said they , he charges you with Sodomy , and says you gave him the Cloaths on that Account . Another Man coming by at the same time , I desir 'd his Assistance ; but they telling him that I was a Molly , he said I ought to be hang 'd , and he 'd have nothing to do with me ; then the Prisoner began to run , and I after him ; but one of the two Men , who expected to be paid for their Day 's Work , kick 'd up my Heels , and as I was rising , he struck me down again ; I was very much hurt , and spit Blood , so that I could not follow them , and so they all got over a Ditch and escaped ; I went to my Lodgings in Eagle-Court . They were surprised to see me come home in such a shabby Dress ; I told 'em what had happen 'd , and describ 'd the Man , and said that he sent a Letter to his Mother in Calston's-Court ; O , Says one , I know him , his Name is Tom Gordon , and his Mother 's Name is Abbot . So I got Justice Giffard 's Warrant the same Day , and finding the Prisoner at a Brandy-shop Door in Drury-Lane , we seized him , and carried him to Brogdon Poplet 's , and I sent for Mr. Levit , and Mr. Sydney , who lodg 'd in the same House as I lodg 'd in ; so the Prisoner was sent to the Round-house , and carry 'd before the Justice next Day . He told the Justice that I put my Yard into his Hand twice ; and says the Justice , You had a long Knife , it seems , why did you not cut it off ? I would have done so . The Prisoner said that he was not willing to expose me so much . Here are certain Ladies that belong to Brogdon Poplet , who , I suppose , have abundance to say for the Prisoner . Court . What Business do you follow ? Cooper . I am a Gentleman 's Servant , but am out of Place at present ; the last Place I liv 'd in was Capt . Brabolt 's at Greenwich . Prisoner . Did we go out of the Night Cellar together ? Cooper . No , you follow 'd me . Christopher Sandsord , Taylor . On the 29th of May , in the Evening , I was drinking with Mr. Mead at the King's-Arms by Leicester-Fields when the Prosecutor came in , dress 'd in a black Coat , a white Waistcoat , and black Breeches ; he sat down and drank , and then paid his Reckoning , and went away . Next Morning I saw Mr. Mead again , he said he had met the Prosecutor in a dirty ragged Suit of Cloaths , and a speckled Shirt , and never set his Eyes on a Man so metamorphos 'd . But how came he in that Condition ? says I , Why it seems he has been robb 'd this Morning , says he , by one Gordon , a Leather-breahes Maker . I pared with Mr. Mead as I was going by Turnstile in Holbourn , the Prisoner pull 'd me by the Coat , and said , How d 'ye do ? what do n't ye know me ? and indeed I hardly did know him in that Dress . What is it you , Mr. Gordon ? says I , why I heard you was dead . Dead ! says he , who told you so ? Why Cooper , says I , he drank with me last Night . Cooper is a great Rouge , says he ; What has be done ? says I ; He gave me these Cloaths this Morning , says he ; And is he a Rouge for that ? says I ; No , says he , but he pretends to get 'em again by Force . Hark ye , Tom , says I , as you have a Soul to be sov 'd , I fancy you 'll come to be hang 'd ; for he has sworn a Robbery against you . Has he really done it ? says he ; for God 's Sake help me to make it up , I 'll go and get 3 Guineas of my Uncle in the Temple , and meet you at the Bell and Horse-shoe in Holborn . I told the Prosecutor of this , and he went with me , but we could find no such Sign as the Bell and Horse-shoe . John Sanders . Between 9 and 10 on Tuesday Night I was sent for to the Two Sugar-Loaves in Drury-Lane ; the Prosecutor gave me a Warrant against the Prisoner ; we went before Justice Newton ; the Justice having heard the Prosecutor 's Charge , ask 'd the Prisoner what he had to say for himself ? Why , says the Prisoner , he laid his privy Rarts in my Hand , and offer 'd to B - me . Then says Mr. Newton , You had better take him before Justice Giffard toMorrow , he knows more of the Matter , for I see it is his Warrant . So the Prisoner was sent to the Round-house . The Prisoner 's Defence . I was lock 'd out , and went to Mrs. Holder 's Night-Cellar ; the Prosecutor came and sat by me , and ask 'd me to drink , I thought I had seen him before ; we fell into Discourse , and had 3 hot Pints of Gin and Ale between us ; about 4 in the Morning he ask 'd me to take a Walk ; we went into Chelsea Fields , and coming among some Trees and Hedges , he kiss 'd me , and put his privy Parts into my Hand ; I ask 'd him what he meant by that , and told him I would expose him ; he begg 'd me not to do it , and said he would make me amends . I ask 'd him what amends ? He said he would give me all his Cloaths , if I would accept of them , and so we agreed , and chang 'd Cloaths . After this , I ask 'd him to go into the White-Horse by Hyde-Park , but he said he would not , for he had Relations there , and did not care to expose himself in that Dress . We went farther , and I would have gone into another House , but he made the same Excuse : Then we came to Little Windmill-street , where we found a Man knocking at an Alehouse Door ; we thought to have gone in there , but it being early the People would not get up , and so we went to the White-Hart in Knaves-Acre ; there he charg 'd me with a Robbery , and I charg 'd him with an Attempt to commit Sodomy . We went before Justice Mercer , who order 'd us to get a Constable , and in going along , the Prosecutor raised a Mob , and squall 'd as I had been murdering him , so that I was glad to get away . He afterwards met me again as I was talking with my Master in Drury-Lane , and carry 'd me to Mr. Paplet 's . Margaret Holder . I keep the Night-Cellar , the Prisoner came in about 10 at Night , and staid till 2 in the Morning , and then the Prosecutor came in , and sat down by him , and said , Your Servant , Sir ; have you any Company belonging to you , for I do n't love much Company ? Then they had 3 Pints of Huckle and Buss , as we call it , that 's Gin and Ale made hot ; and so about 4 o'Clock the Prisoner said he would go home , for his Mother would be up , and he might get in without his Father 's Knowledge ; and the Prosecutor said , If you go , I 'll go to ; so the Prisoner went up first , and the Prosecutor staid to change a Shilling , and went out after him . I believe the Prisoner is an honest Man ; but the Prosecutor and Kitt Sandford too , use to come to my Cellar with such sort of People . Court . What sort of People ? Helder . Why , to tell you the Truth , he 's one of the Runners that carries Messages between Gentlemen in that way . C In what way ? H. Why he 's one of them as you call Milly Culls , he gets his Bread that way ; to my certain Knowledge he has got many a Crown under some Gentlemen , for going of sodomiting Errands . Robert Shaw . The Prisoner and Prosecutor , and four more came to my House , the White-Hart in Knaves-Acre , about 6 o'Clock on Tuesday Morning ; says the Prisoner , this Fellow charges me with a Robbery . How so ? says I ; Why , says he , we have been in Chelsea Fields , and he gave me his Cloaths to let him commit Sodomy with me , and now he wants them again . After the second Pot , they disputed who should pay ; says the Prosecutor , You know I have but 3 ba ' pence , for when I gave you my Breeches there was 4 1/2 d. in 'em , and when I took yours , I found but 3 ha ' pence in the Pocket . Then the Prosecutor desir 'd to go to his Cousin Smith , a Distiller hard by , to borrow a Shilling ; a Man went with him , he brought back a Shilling , and paid his Reckoning . Court . Did the Prosecutor contradict what the Prisoner said about changing Cloaths ? Show . No , not in my hearing . Edward Pacock . About 5 a Clock o ' Tuesday Morning , as I was coming along Chelsea-Fields , I saw a Men a stripping among some Trees ; I thought they were going to sight , but I soon found there was no Quarrel ; for when they had put their Cloaths on , they went away lovingly , and the Prisoner smil 'd ; they look 'd as if they had not been a-bed all Night , no more than I had ; for you must know , being Holiday time , I got drunk , and fell asleep with my Cloaths on . Court . How far off was you when you saw them ? Pcock . Within 20 or 30 Yards . Court . How came the Prisoner to find you out ? Poock . I happen 'd to go to Holder 's Cellar , and there I heard talk of this Robbery ; and says I 'll be hang 'd if these were not the 2 Men that thought were going to sight ; so I went to Newgate to see the Prisoner , and knew him to be one of 'em ; and he afterwards sent me a Subna . John Thorp . It being Holiday time , I and another Stocking-maker , and 2 Shoe-makers , had been out a merry making , and in the Morning we came to the Two Brewers in Little Windmill-street ; the People were not up , and while I stood knocking at the Door , the Prisoner and the Prosecutor came along close together ; says the Prosecutor , this Man has got my Cloaths on his Back ; and say the Prisoner , He gave them me to commit Sodomy . We told them it was a candalous Business , and advised them to make it up between themselves , and change Cloaths again . The Prosecutor said he desir 'd nothing more than to have his Cloaths again ; but the Prisoner would not consent , For nothing is srcer than Gift , says he , and I 'll see you out . We could not get in at the Two Brewers , and so went to Mr. Shaw 's in Knaves-Acre , and not agreeing there , we went to the Coach and Horses by St. Giles 's Church ; and there the Prisoner wrote a Letter to his Mother , it was directed to his Father , a Taylor , at Numb . 4. in Colston's-Court , I found the House according to the Direction , and deliver 'd the Letter , but his Father was not up , and when I return 'd to the Coach and Horses they were all gone . Prisoner . Did not you go to the Prosecutor 's Cousin , the Distiller , in Warder-street ? Thorp . Yes ; he told his Cousin he was pawn 'd for a Shilling ; says his Cousin , As you are in the Neighbourhood , I do n't care to be scandaliz 'd by you , there 's a Shilling , but go about your Business , and let me bear no more of you , for you are a vile Fellow , and I 'm afraid you 'll come to an ill end . The Character of the Prisoners Seraphim . Jane Jones . I am a Washer-woman in Drury-Lane , I went into Mr. Poplet 's , my next Door Neighbour , for a Pint of Beer , and said , There 's the Princess Seraphina ! So I look 'd at her , and the Prisoner was in the same Box ; and says he to the Princess , What a vile Villain was you to - Court . What Princess ? Jones . The Prosecutor ; he goes by that Name . What a Villain was you , says the Prisoner , to offer so vile a thing ? Did not you do so and so ? Court . So and so ; explain your self . Jones . Why in the way of Sodomity , whatever that is ; so says the Princess , If you do n't give me my Cloaths again , I 'll swear a Robbery against you ; but if you 'll let me have them , I 'll be easy . No , you Villain , you sha n't , says the Prisoner . Next Day I went to Mr. Stringer the Pawn-broker 's , facing Vinegar-yard in Drury-Lane ; I wash for him , and there I saw the Princess a pawning her Shirt ; O Princess ! says I , are you there ? You will be very fine by and by ; you will have no Occasion to pawn your Linen , when you get the Rewa rd for hanging Tom Gordon . But how can you be so cruel to swear his Life away , when you have own 'd that you chang 'd with him ? What if I did , says he , I do n't value that , I shall do nothing but what I have been advised to . Mary Poplet . I keep the Two Sugar-Loaves in Drury-Lane , the Prisoner and the Princess came into my House , and the Princess charg 'd the Prisoner with taking her Cloaths , and the Prisoner call 'd her Villain , and said she gave 'em to him . I have known her Highness a pretty while , she us 'd to come to my House from Mr. Tull , to enquire after some Gentlemen of no very good Character ; I have seen her several times in Women 's Cloaths , she commonly us 'd to wear a white Gown , and a scarlet Cloak , with her Hair frizzled and curl 'd all round her Forehead ; and then she would so flutter her Fan , and make such fine Curt ies , that you would not have known her from a Woman : She takes great Delight in Balls and Masquerades , and always chuses to appear at them in a Female Dress , that she may have the Satisfaction of dancing with fine Gentlemen . Her Highness lives with Mr. Tull in Eagle-Court in the Strand , and calls him her Master , because she was Nurse to him and his Wife when they were both in a Salivation ; but the Princess is rather Mr. Tull 's Friend , than his domestick Servant . I never heard that she had any other Name than the Princess Sraphina . Mary Ryley . I was standing at the End of our Court in Drury-Lane , and seeing the Prisoner coming along with a Crowd , Tom ! says I , what 's the Matter ? Why , says he , pointing to the Princess , this Man gave me his Cloaths to let him B - r me , and now he charges me with a Robbery . I know the Princess very well , she goes a Nursing sometimes : She nurs 'd his Master Tull and his Wife in their Salivation , and several others ; and I was told that he was dress 'd in Woman 's Cloaths at the last Masquerade ( Ridotto al Fresco at Vaux Hall . ) Sometimes we call her Princess , and sometimes Miss . Mary Robinson . I was trying on a Suit of Red Damask at my Mantua-maker 's in the Strand , when the Princess Seraphina came up , and told me the Suit look 'd mighty pretty . I wish , says he , you would lend 'em me for a Night , to go to Mrs. Green 's in Nottingham-Court , by the Seven Dials , for I am to meet some fine Gentlemen there . Why , says I , ca n't Mrs. Green furnish you ? Yes , says he , she lends me a Velvet Scarf and a Gold Watch sometimes . He used to be but meanly dress 'd , as to Men 's Cloaths , but he came lately to my Mantua-maker 's , in a handsome Black Suit , to invite a Gentlewoman to drink Tea with Mrs. Tull . I ask 'd him how he came to be so well Rigg 'd ? And he told me his Mother had lately sold the Reversion of a House ; And now , says he , I 'll go and take a Walk in the Park , and shew my self . Soon after this , my Maid told me that her Highness was robb 'd by a Man in a Sailor 's Habit , who had changed Cloaths with him . And so next Morning I sent for him . Lord , Princess ! says I , you are vastly alter 'd . Ay , Madam , says he , I have been robb 'd , but I shall get the Reward for hanging the Rogue . Another Time he comes to me , and says , Lord , Madam , I must ask your Pardon , I was at your Mantua-maker 's Yesterday , and dress 'd my Head in your Lac 'd Pinners , and I would sain have borrow 'd them to have gone to the Ridotto at Vauxhall last Night , but I cou 'd not persuade her to lend 'em me ; but however she sent me your Callimanco Gown and Madam Nuttal 's Mob , and one of her Smocks , and so I went thither to pick up some Gentlemen to Dance . And did you make a good Hand of it , Princess ? says I . No , Madam , says be , I pick 'd up two Men , who had no Money , but however they proved to be my old Acquaintance , and very good Gentlewomen they were , One of them has been transported for counterfeiting Masquerade Tickets ; and t'other went to the Masquerade in a Velvet Domine , and pick 'd up an old Gentleman , and went to Bed with him , but as soon as the old Fellow found that he had got a Man by his Side , he cry 'd out , Murder . Eliz . Jones . I saw the Princess Seraphina standing at Mr. Pople 's Door . What , have you been robb 'd , Princess ? says I , Has Tom Gordon stripp 'd your Highness stark naked ? An impudent Rogue ! And yet , Ma 'm , I think your Highness had better make it up with him , than expose yourself , for some say it was only an Exchange . Why , sysle , at first I would have made it up , and taken my Cloaths again , but now it 's too late , and I must prosecute , for those that were concerned in taking him up , expect their Share in the Reward , and wo n't let me drop the Prosecution . Andrew Monford . I heard the Prosecutor say to the Prisoner ( at Mr. Poplet 's ) Tom ! give me my Cloaths . And the other answer 'd , No , you Rogue , I wo n't : Did not you put your Hand in my Breeches , to pull out what I had ?

You must know that I am a Plaisterer , and I was coming Home from St. James 's to East-Smithfield , and I thought by the Way to call upon my Master , a Bricklayer , who lives in an Alley in Drury-lane ; but being full of Liquor , I mistook , and went down Holford 's Alley , and there the Prisoner and another lewd Woman stood at a Door , and pull 'd and push 'd me into a low Room , and I being full of Liquor , and heavy for Sleep , to Sleep I went ; but by-and-by I felt something tickling about my Neck , and so I waked , and found the Prisoner taking off my Stock , wherein was a Silver Buckle . What , says I , are ye going to rob me ? Rob ye ? says she , what signifies such a foolish Thing as this ? It well never fetch above the Consequence of a Slling .

You say you was drunk , are you sure you dropp 'd none of it in the Street ? Ford . Yes , I was drunk , that 's true ; but not so drunk as that comes to neither . Court . Did you go into no Company before you met with the Prisoner ? Ford . Yes , I went to drink with 2 Men , upon the Acknowledgment of my coming out of the Country , and then I was more fuddled than before ; when we came to pay the Reckoning , I had 33 s. 6d . Court . You said you had but 31 s. 6 d. before you went into the Alehouse . Ford . I said so because I made no Acknowledgement of the Consequence of the 2 s. which I spent afterwards at the Alehouse . Court . And whither did you go next ? Ford . I went to another House , and drank the Consequence of 2 or 3 full Pots of Beer , but I spent no Money there , because I was treated . I remember it well enough , for I was sober when I came out of the House . Court . Do you drink yourself sober ? How came you drunk then before you came to the Bandy-house ? Ford . Why , I do n't know ; with talking of one Thing or another , I think : But I was full of Liquor , that I was . Court . When you was so full of Liquor , could you know one Woman from another ? Ford . Yes , I acknowledged the Woman next Day . Court . Did you feel her pick your Pocket ? Ford . No , I felt nothing about my Pocket , being heavy to Sleep ; but when I began to wag my Head , she proceeded to the Feet of the Bed , and having a strong Suspicion that she took my Stock , I charged her with picking my Pocket . Court . You said , you felt her take your Stock . Ford . Yes , she took it by main Force . Court .

Thomas Sylvester was indicted for a Misdemeanour , in attempting to commit the unnatural Sin of Sodomy . P. Kirk . The Prisoner had been my Chum in the Fleet-Prison for 6 or 7 Weeks . On Tuesday the 4th of April last , he went to Bed before me , and as soon as I came to Bed to him , he caught me in his Arms and kiss 'd me . I desired him to desist , for I did not like such Behaviour . I turn 'd about , and went to sleep , and by-and-by he thrust his Y - d so hard against my Fun - t , that it waked me . I told him I would bear such Usage no longer , his Inclinations were not for my liking , nor never would ; and if he made any farther Offers that Way , I would immediately complain , and expose him to the whole House . He swore , if I spoke of it , he would do me a private Mischief . He had made some such Offers before , and talk 'd to me in the most vile Way ; and therefore I had desired the Chamberlain to let me be removed , but the House was then so full that I could not be chum 'd elsewhere . At last I resolved to discover his Behaviour , notwithstanding his threatning to do me a Mischief , and so I sent to ask an Attorney 's Advice how I should proceed , and then on the Sunday following I disclosed it .

Because , says he , this would have B - d me . I told Sylvester of it . He said , that the other was a lying Rascal , and would have served him so . A Day or two after they both met in the Publick Room , and charged one another , and gave one another the Lye , so that the House had a Suspicion of them both , and the Prosecutor , as well as the other , got the Name of a lying , sodomytical Fellow , and it was thought scandalous to keep Company with either of 'em .

July 1 . Cath . Burkett . Between 10 and 11 last Wednesday Night , as I was going along Brownlow-street in Drury-Lane , I heard somebody come tripping after me , and presently Philip Thomas took hold of my left Arm , and turn 'd me round against the Rails by Justice Mercer 's House ; then he felt about my Coats , and about my Hands for Rings ; then Baker came up , and bid the other cut my Throat ; I was very much frighted , and did not speak a Word for Fear , but held up my Arms to save my Throat , when Thomas with a white handled Penknife gave me a Cut along my Arm , and then snatch 'd my Pocket from under my Apron and run away . The Watchman found the Pocket the same Night as he was going 11 o'Clock , but there was nothing in it as he told me . Court . Could you see their Faces plain enough to know 'em again ? Burkett . Yes ; there was a Glass-Lamp at the Bagnio , and when I came home to St. Giles 's , I described them so exactly that they were taken the next Morning , and I went to see them in St. Giles 's Roundhouse about 9 , and knew them both as soon as ever I saw them . Court . Where is the Cut in your Arm ? Burk . Here it is . Court . It looks more like a slight Scratch with a Pin , than a Cut with a Penknife . P. Thomas . I 'll prove that we were in a House at the Seven Dials when you say this Robbery was done . P. J. Baker . She sent a Man to Newgate about half a Year ago for robbing her of a Pocket * . * It was in January last . See the Trial of Berry and Loveday in Sessions-Paper , Numb . II Part I . Page 53. George Redgate . Mr. Burkell call 'd me up about 5 last Thursday Morning , and told me that his Wife had been robb 'd , and that he had some suspicion of 2 Men , who he believ 'd were sauntring about the Seven Dials . We went to a Brandy-shop and took the Prisoners , who he said answer 'd his Wife 's Description ; she came to see them in the Round-house , and as soon as the Governor of the Round-house shew 'd them , she said she could swear to P. Thomas , because he turn 'd her round , but she could not swear to Baker , because she did not see his Face . The Prisoners brought a Soldier and a Woman to prove that they were in St. Andrew's-street by the Seven Dials , at a Brandy-shop , at the same time the Robbery was said to be committed ; and so the Jury acquitted them . 67.
