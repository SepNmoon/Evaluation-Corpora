See summary . ] William Finch , of St. Jame 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing a Hat , value 6 s. from the person of William Keen , a Child , the 4th of June last .

Alice Thomas , of St. Giles Cripplegate , was indicted for stealing from the Person of Zachary Levy ( a Jew ) 1 Gold Ring , Value 10 s. and 2 Guineas the 30th of May last . The Prosecutor deposed , that being in Moorfields , he went into a house to drink a dram of Brandy , having 3 Guineas in his pocket ; and that he gave the man of the house one of them to change and he changed it ; that the Prisoner coming in , asked him to go up stairs with her , and he went , and being there she was very familiar with him and before about him ; whereupon he bid her keep her hands out of his pocket ; she replyed she would not pick his pocket , but for all that he missed his Ring and Money , and that he had but 13 s.6 d. left in his pocket . The Prisoner in her defence pleaded , that the Prosecutor came in and called for a dram of Brandy , as he had said , and offered her Master a Guinea to Change ; that her Master not having Silver enough , thought much of the trouble to get it changed for a Penny ; upon which the Prosecutor pulled out a Penny , but told her Master neverthess if he would change the Guinea , he would spend a Shilling of it , whereupon he stept out and got it changed , and the Prosecutor in the mean time asked for a room ; she told him , he might be at the end of the shop ; he answered , that was not private enough , for his Master was but a few doors off , at one Mr. Beger 's , buying a Horse , and his Fellow-Servant in the Field , and he would not have them see him there ; whereupon he went up stairs , called for a quartern of Brandy , which she carried ; that he pulled her upon his knee , but she got away , and went about her business , being then in walking the house ; and that immediately he knocked again , and she going up , he called for another quarters , having as she thought , thrown down the sick ( for the room was wet ; ) that he fell to her upon his knee again , but she would not fit ; them he asked if they sold no better liquor , and if they sold no Solder , and called for a pine , which she carried and that she was force got down when he knocked again , and called for another pint , which she going to carry up , found him not in the room where she left him ; and calling to her Master to know if he were not gone away without paying the Reckoning , the Prosecutor , from another pair of stairs , cry 'd out , l am bere ; she goes up , ask 'd him what he did in that room ; he , calling her his Dear , said , he liked to fit there better , being it was more airy ; that she being in the room , he shut the door , attempted to throw her upon the Bed , and would have forced her to have let him lain with her ; upon which she struggled with him , he got her down on the Ground , and pulling out a Penknife , swore he would stick her if she did not consent ; that she crying out , her Master came up and rescued her . The Master , Joseph Adams , deposed the same the Prisoner had done , adding , that she being gone up to carry him a pine of Sider , he heard a mighty struggling , and the Prisoner cry out ; he ran up stairs , and heard the Prosecutor say , You Bitch , if you wo n't , i 'll cut your Throat ; whereupon he forc 'd open the door , found the Prisoner on the ground , and the Prosecutor kneeling upon her with his Penknife in his hand ; whereupon fearing he would hurt her the Girl , he did not stand disputing with him , but immediately kicked him from off her ; whereupon he fell to calling him names and swearing , wounded him on the Hand with the Penknife , but he struck it out of his hand , and that he might not recover it again , kick 'd it under the bed ; then the Prosecutor took up a Coffee-pot , flung at him , and broke the window ; but having master 'd him , asked him what business he had there , and how he came there ; he told him , perhaps he flew in at the Window , or the Devil brought him there ; he answered him , if the Devil had brought him up the Devi should carry him down again , and so push 'd him out of the door and down stairs ; whereupon he called him a great many names in his language and a great many English Dogs in the English tongue saying , he had pick 'd his Pocket of 15 s. and went for a Constable , which when he came , he thought it had been for himself , he having charged him with the robbing him and not the Girl , but when the Constable came , he charged him with the Prisoner . Several persons apeared in the Prisoner 's behalf , who gave this character of her , That she being a Relation to her Master , who was a single man , her Parents upon his request let her live with him to look after his House ; that she was a very civil , honest Girl and no such Person as the Prosecutor pretended therefore appearing a'prosecution malicious and vilainous , the Jury acquitted her . William Liecester , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for the Murder of John Corbet , by driving a Cart over him the 7th of May last and giving him a mortal Bruise of which he died .

James Evans deposed , that himself the Prisoner , and one Rhodes , did the Fact ; that the Prisoner look 'd in at the Window , and seeing no body there , said it was a Bob ken ( i.e . that it was a House easy to be robbed ) so he broke the Sash , stole the Stockings , and sold them to Deborah Stens . Another Evidence depos 'd that when they apprehended him he told them he was not afraid of being Hang 'd , for he should never be Hang 'd by the Testimony of one that made himself in Evidence , for he had been try 'd several times before and always came off for all their Evidences ; however the Jury now found him Guilty of the Indictment .

He likewise called a great many Persons of Credit who gave him an extraordinary Character , for Honesty and Fidelity ; whereupon the Jury acquitted him . John Long and Mary and Mary his Wife , of St. Katharine 's near the Tower , were indicted for feloniously stealing a Silver Tankard , value 7 l. a Silver Spoon , value 8 s.73 l. in Money , a Moidore , and 2 Twenty-shilling Pieces of Gold , out of the Dwelling-house of Edward Chase , the 8th of April last . Mrs. Chase deposed , That the Prisoner being a Barber rented a shop in her house , and that one John Hawks and Matthew Bethel , Seafaring Men , likewise lodged in her house ; that they were all acquainted with her having the Money by her , knowing she had lately received it ; that John Hawks and Matthew Bethel did not come home that night ; but the Prisoner , who always used to lie at East Ham at his Wife 's Father 's , on the Sunday night , lay that night she was robb 'd in her house . That hearing that Hawks and Bethel were seen about the Door that night , she suspected they were the Persons that robbed her , and accordingly got them apprehended , the Prisoner assisting her in their apprehension , and pretending he was robb 'd of some Wigs also ( she at that time not suspecting the Prisoner ) but hearing some things relating to him , and seeing him live at a more expensive rate than before , and finding Money more plenty , and he about buying Goods to a Considerable value , she began to suspect him to have been concerned in robbing her , and talked pretty home to him about the matter ; he answered her , she would certainly hear of her Money and Plate again in 8 days time ; and to satisfie for how he came by so much Money he told her he had lately received 70 l. upon a Attorney , and to confirm it , Shew 'd her a Attorney , which she took notice was without Seal and this made her the more suspicious of and she being very uneasy , he told her she would certainly have her Plate and Money return 'd in 8 days time . And that on the 13th of May a brought her a Letter ( which was produced in Court ) signifying that there was a Box directed to her at the Crown near the Ditch-side , upon which she stopped the Porter , and he went with her there , found the Box and Plate in it , and the Bag in which the Money had been , but no Money ; and that there was likewise in the Box a scrap of Callicoe , the same with the Lining of Sara Long 's Gown ; and enquiring of the Porter , Who gave him the Letter , he described the Prisoner John Long , and that she keeping the Porter in the House , the Prisoner came in , and the Porter said positively that was the Man that gave him the Letter ; and likewise she added , that the Prisoner seeing the Porter there , in great confusion lift up his hands , saying he was undone ; and pretending to go to fetch a Book to reckon with her about some accounts , went out of doors , and came no more for two days , when he was apprehended . Several Persons depos 'd in confirmation of several of these circumstances . And John Morrice the Porter swore positively in Court , that the Prisoner was the man that called him at the Hoop and Griffin Tavern-door in Leaderball street , and sent him with the Letter , telling him if he did not make hasre , there would be a person at the place before him . The Prisoner in his defence deny 'd his being the Person that sent the Letter , and brought some Persons who deposed , that having talked with John Morrice the Portor , he told them , he was in great trouble in Mind in swearing the Prisoner was the Man that sent him with the Letter , either knowing or suspecting he had sworn falsely , wishing he had been sick in his bed when he had done it , and saying he was compell 'd to it by some other persons . To which John Morrice reply 'd that he did say he was sorry he should be concerned in so troublesome an Affair , but was not sorry he had detected a Rogue ; he brought also several who gave him the Character of an honest , tender-spirited Man , and one that would not be guilty of so great Villany . The Prisoner likewise produced Persons that had paid him Money much about that time , and brought some Persons to speak to his Reputation . Upon the whole the Jury acquitted him . Thomas Smith , of St. Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for contriving , counselling , aiding , and abetting , Francis Williams , Matthew Chessey , and William Holliday , in robbing William Honour ( the Post-boy ) on the King 's Highway , and taking from him 1 Strawberry Gelding , value 6 l. and 1 Black Gelding , value 10 l. the property of John Boucher ; 4 Mails val.8 l. and 50 Leather Bags , val 5 l. the 23d of Jan . last . The Prisoner objected against the Legality of Holiday 's Evidence , alledging that he had been convicted of Felony , and had not performed the Conditions of his Pardon . The former part of his Allegation was allow 'd ; but that he had not fulfilled the Conditions of his Pardon was not prov 'd and therefore the Court accepted him as a Legal Evidence , Whereupon William Holiday deposed , That the Prisoner brought him first acquainted with Williams and Chessey , which was upon the 18th of January , and that he recommended them to him as stout Fellows , fit to undertake any bold Enterprize and that at that time they projected the robbing of the Bost-boy , he going with them to procure horses to put the Design in execution , telling him likewise he would borrow Pistols for him , but did not , but brought them Bags to put the Letters in , and that he was to have 6 Guineas a man of them for his Share , and that he came to Chessey 's house the morning after he had robbed the Post , and that who ' he did not come up , he saw him out at the Window . Mary Holiday deposed , that the night before , when her Husband was going away , he told her , that he did not know that he should come home that night , but if he did not , he should go out of Town , bidding her , if he did not , to go to Smith 's Lodgings , and he would direct her to find him ; and that accordingly she went to Smith about 7 or 8 of the clock the next morning , when he was in bed , but coming down to her underst , she lent him her lanthorn and candle , and he went up and dressed himself , came down to her , and went with her to Chessey 's Lodging , in Fetter-lane , and seeing the Portes at the door , was angry they were not sent home , bidding her to tell them to seed the Horses home , left by them they should be betray 'd , and that he would no go up to them , because he said it was scandalous house , and the noise of the fact would soon be all over the Town , and there they would be in danger of being apprehended ; that she went up stairs , found her Husband , Williams , and Chessey , all over dirt , an like frighted men , busie in opening Letters ; that when she came in her Husband was very angry at her coming , ask 'd how she came , she told them Smith had brought her ; that then Williams reply 'd Why did he not come up ? she said , he would not , Williams reply 'd , G - A - him ! What , has he put us upon it and now will not be seen in it ? That then she went down to Smith , but he would not go up ; she asked him what they had done ; he answered her , taken the Mail ; she asked him , what might be the Consequence ( meaning the Advantage ; ) he reply 'd 5 or 6000 l. and she being uneasy he said to her , What need you be uneasy ? You will soon be made a Gentlewoman . She depos 'd likewise , That he preposed they should carry the Letters into some empty House to open and telling her that he could not attend that Day because he most attend a Law Suit he had . She deposed likewise , that she afterwards saw him look upon a Note which she describ 'd and was produc 'd in Court , telling him it was a Chequer-Note of 100 l. and also another Paper which he said was as well , and saying he would likewise know the meaning of that too , The Prisoner objected against the Evidence of Holliday 's Wife , saying that she was not his Wife , but that he had several in several places , and that Holiday had said , that he must have one in every place to swear for him in case he stood in need of an Evidence . This was return 'd upon him that he himself had said , that as to what related to Evidence he could do as much as any body ; that he had such Evidences that he could prove himself to be at while he was here . The Prisoner deny 'd the Fact entirely , and pleaded in his Defence , That he was not with Holliday 's Wife , as she depos 'd and had Evidence at hand that depos 'd he came to him between 6 and 7 that morning to draw an Affidavit and another that said she saw him in Westminister-Hall at 8 a clock . He made an Improvement likewise , that the Persons were not produced of whom the Horses were hired . He insisted on the Improbability that he should engage in such a Design and have no share of the Booty . He insisted likewise that the Prosecution was set on fact by some Adversaries whom he was suing as Creditor on account of a statute of Bankruptcy taken out against one George Little ; not was he destitude of Evidences who deposed several Circumstances , making that appear planfible . Upon the whole , the Case being thus intricated , the Jury acquitted him . He was likewise a second time indicted for forging a Letter of Attorney , in order to defraud the Creditors of George Little of their Mony ; but the Court not having time to try it in this Sessions , it was deferr 'd till the next .
