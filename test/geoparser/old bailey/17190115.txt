In proof of which he called the following Evidences . S - W - deposed that the being at the place aforesaid , the Prisoner about Two of the Clock in the Morning knock 'd and wou 'd have a Bath , but the Waiter made . Answer , that there was a great Gentleman in the Bath and he could not till 5 in the Morning , and then he would call him , that he saying he would have one presently , the Waiter reply 'd G - d D - m him for a Rascal he neither could nor should have any , to which the Prisoner reply 'd that Gentlemen were not to be so abused , that upon this he arose and pushed the Waiter out of Doors , who lock 'd the Door after him and lock 'd them in that them knock 'd again , and they came up and threat'ned to turn them out of Doors and that the Man at the Bedsfeet struck the Prisoner and she heard an out cry of Murder , and was afraid they should both be Murdered , and that she saw the Prisoner rise up in his Bed and Men holding him , that when the deceased lay dead on the Ground he had a dark colour 'd Cane hanging on his Wrist by a black String , but she knew of no Sword in the Bed . nor saw any Wound given . E - R - deposed , that she lodging that Night at the Bagnio , and hearing the disturbance , went to the Prisoners Room and saw the deceased lying on the Floor , and a Cane lying by him in the Room , and a Faggor-stick upon the Stairs hard by the Door of the Room , which last Circumstance as to the Faggor-stick was also confirm 'd by another Evidence . The Walker who succeeded the deceased as Waiter at the Bagnio deposed , that a Gentleman that came to the Bagnio and enquired into the circumstances of the Fact , being Shew 'd the Room in which it was done , examined the Door and Wainscot , and could not perceive any Marks of the 8 or 10 Passes made against it by the Prisoner , as had been deposed by . The Barberton alias Vernassel , and that he discoursing with Baberton about the breaking of his Ribbs , seeing him stript , saw no mark or appearance of any such thing and that Baberton when he asked him why he did not apply something to them , said they were not broke but bruis 'd . And as to the deceased , besides an ill Character , and that he used to be abusive to Gentlemen , had been wounded not long before , at the Prosecutors could not deny . The Prisoner called several Evidences to prove that his Shirt was very much torn , this was confirmed by the Constable and Watchman that apprehended him , and also was produced in Court : He also called the Constable and Watchman and Several other Evidences who deposed , they did see a bruise on his Arm and also a hurt upon his Knuckles , and that they were bloody . He likewise called several Persons of Credit and Worth to his Reputation and peaceable demeanour , who gave him a very good Character . He also observed that little credit was to be given to the Evidence of Baberton alias Vernassel , who had swore that 3 or 4 of his Ribs were broke , when it was sworn By another Evidence that he himself owned his Ribs were not broken , but only that he was bruised , and that he owned in Court that he never had made use of any Surgeon , & c . on that account . Upon the hearing of the whole Matter , the Jury found him guilty of all the Indictment , and he receiv 'd Sentence of Death accordingly . Before the receiving of which , being asked what he had to say , why Judgement should not pass upon him according to Law he spoke to the Court as followeth . I submit my self to your Lordship and this Honourable Bench ; and I beg only your honourable Favour and Regard that as she Witness 's for me swore positively to my being assaulted and that the Jury ( to my , great Misfortune ) were not pleased to give Credit to the family your Lordship will make the most favourable Interpretation of it . But above all I desire your Lordship 's notice , that there were many manifest Contradiction , in Vernassell 's Evidence , and I may say Impossibilities in other of their Witnesses . Besides her denying on my Tryal that he did double lock the Door , which he swore he did before the Coroner , makes me with reason believe my Life has been maliciously sought ; for I call God to Witness , I did not offer the least Violence to the Deceased till after I was struck and ill used by him . I submit my self to your Lordship , and hope your will make such favorable Report to his Majesty as may not obstruct , but leave room to apply to his Wisdom for Mercy . The Tryals being over , the Court proceeded to give Judgement Received Sentence of Death 15.
