Sessions-Paper , Numb , IV . pag . 114 . And last Sessions he was try 'd with James Ford for a Burglary , but they were both acquitted . Robert Alcock . I live with Mrs. Wall , who keeps a Shop the Corner of Mark-lane in Tower-street . In the Evening I shut the Sash-door next the Street , but did not bolt it , and went backward to light Candles . In about 5 Minutes I return 'd with the Candles , and found the Door open . I look 'd in the Pigeon-holes behind the Counter , and miss 'd a Parcel of Men 's Gloves , upon which I enquir 'd in the Neighbourhood , if any suspicious Persons had been about the Door ; and Richard Pitt inform 'd me , that he had seen such a one as Whitesides loitering up and down , and sometimes standing by a Ballad-singer ; and he said , if we went directly to Rag-Fair , we might chance to find him with the Goods in some Gin-shop . So Pitt , and John Hawkins , and Edward Ford , and I went all together . And as we were passing by the backside of the first House , from Tower-hill , going into Rag-fair , we look 'd in at a Window , where there was a Candle , and saw Whitesides trying on a pair of the Gloves ; upon which we went to the Fore-door , and found Marshall shutting up the Stall ( it was an Apple-stall ; ) we search 'd him , and took one pair of Gloves out of his Pocket , and then we went in ; but having made some Disturbance in seizing Marshall , I suppose Whitesides took the Alarm and hid the Gloves ; for at our first going into the Back-room we could find nothing but the Paper they had been wrapp 'd in , and one pair lying loose on the Dresser : However , upon farther search we found the rest under a Cherry-Sieve . Whitesides ran up Stairs , and Marshall got into the Cellar ; but we got a Constable and secur 'd them both . Richard Pitts . As I stood at my Door , a Girl was singing Ballads , and Whitesides came and saunter 'd about her for some time , and all on a sudden he was gone . I was hardly three Minutes after , when Robert Alcock came out , and said , he had lost a Parcel of Gloves . I told him what a loose Chap I had seen , and that if we went immediately to Rag-fair , it was a Chance if we did not find him a selling the Gloves in some of the Gin-ships . So we and 2 more went , and at a Back-window , I saw Whitesides standing by a Candle , and trying a Pair on . We took Marshall at the Door , and found a pair of Gloves in his Pocket , and going backwards , Whitesides ran up , and Marshall down Stairs . One pair of Gloves lay on the Dresser , and the rest we found under a Cherry-sieve , which a Girl was sitting on . Marshall bid Whitesides go and fetch the Man they bought the Gloves of , and Whitesides would fain have gone , but we would not trust him . Whitesides . I was try 'd here last Sessions , and resolving to get clear of ill Company I enter 'd my self on board a Ship ; but going to take Leave of my Brother , I met Marshall , who ask 'd me to buy a pair of Gloves , and so I stepp 'd into the House to try them on . Marshall . That 's very true , for Whitesides is an innocent Man . I found the Gloves in a Dust-hole by the Postern on Tower-hill , and meeting one Mrs Pattison , she desir 'd me to call at the Corner-house going to Rag-fair , and help the Girl ( Sarah Gibbs ) to shut up Shop , which I did , and Whitesides coming by , I said to him , See here , what I have found ! and , says he , What will you have for a Pair ? I told him , a Groat . So he went backwards to try them on , and in the mean time these People came and broke in upon us . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5.

Clerk . Are you guilty or not guilty ? - Why ca n't you Plead ? Prisoner . I do n't know what you say . Court . Let some Body near him tell him his Charge . Whitesides ( bauling in his Ear ) So ho ! you are indicted for stealing Stockings ! are you guilty or not guilty ? Prisoner . What do you say ? Court . Show him the Charge in writing , [ Then a Paper was shewn him . ] Prisoner . I ca n't read . Court . Prosecutor , could you make him hear when he was apprehended . Prosecutor . He pretended to be deaf then . Court . Is there no Body belonging to Newgate , that knows whether he can hear or not ? Whitesides . He could hear sometimes when they baul 'd to him in Newgate . Court . Then we must make him hear now . Whitesides , bauling , the Court will make you hear . Prisoner . Indeed I am quite deaf . Court . If he remains obslinate he must be press 'd . Whitesides , bauling . The Court says , you must be press 'd to Death if you wo n't hear ! Prisoner . Ha ! Court . Read the Law - Batlet the Executioner first tye his Thumbs . [ Then the Executioner ty 'd his Thumbs together with Whipcord , and with the Assistance of an Officer drew the Knot very hard . ] Prisoner . My dear Lord , I am deaf as the Ground . Executioner . Guilty or not guilty ? Prisoner . My sweet , sugar , precious Lord , I am deaf indeed , and have been so these ten Years . Executioner . Guilty or not guilty ? Court . Hold him there a little - Now loosen the Cord , and give him a little Time to consider of it ; but let him know what he must expect if he continues obstinate , for the Court will not be trifled with . Then the Prisoner was taken , away but in five Minutes was brought back again and pleaded not Guilty . John Hutchins . I live with Mr. Bromfield , at the Woolpack , on the Bridge . The Prisoner and another came into my Master's-Shop , between 8 and 9 in the Morning , and cheapen 'd some Stockings ; I shew 'd them 2 or 3 pair ; they bid me Money , but I could not take it , and so they both went out again . I presently heard some Body in the Street say , Friend , you have dropt your Stockings ; upon which I went out and seiz 'd the Prisoner , and saw the Stockings drop from under his Great-coat ; but his Companion got away . Ralph Ford . I saw some Stockings drop from the Prisoner . A Man took them up , and gave them to him , when Mr. Hutchins coming outseiz 'd the Prisoner , and I saw the Stockings under his Great-coat before he let them fall . Prisoner . The Man that ran away , gave me the Stockings , and told me , he had bought them . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 8.

John Rowland , of St Catherine Creed-Church , was ( indicted for stealing with Jonathan Wood , not yet taken ) half a Pound of Nutmegs , value 4 s. 6 d. the Property of John Shaw , Jan. 21 . About 7 at Night the Prisoner and Wood ( who pretended to be a Captain ) came to the Prosecutor 's Shop for 2 Ounces of Nutmegs . Mrs. Shaw had then 5 or 6 other Customers in her Shop , and tho ' she offer 'd to serve the Prisoner and the Captain , they very civilly refused , and waited till those who came first were served and gone . Then She took out a Drawer of Nutmegs , they tumbled them over , telling her they would have the largest they could pick out . Captain , says the Prisoner , these are very fine ones , you had as good take a quarter of a Pound , and that will serve us all the Voyage . She put some in the Scale ; the Prisoner turned them over there too , and the Captain again got his Hand among those in the Drawer . She saw the Captain put his Hand twice to his Pocket , which giving her a Suspicion , she watched him more narrowly , and the third Time , perceiving that he took some Nutmegs in his Hand , pray , says She , buy ; but do n't Steal . What do ye mean ? says the Prisoner , you mistake the Captain , he 's no such Person . Upon that , she catch 'd hold of the Captain 's Coat , and felt the Nutmegs , and while she held him , and was taking them out , Mr. Osborn her Neighbour came over : She told him how they had served her , but the Captain giving a Spring got loose and ran away . The Prisoner said , he was surprized the Captain should do such a Thing , and offer 'd to pay for what was missing . She told him , she believ 'd he had done the same , by his being so busy with his hand in the Scale . Mr. Osborn offer 'd to search him , but the Prisoner swore he should not , and endeavour 'd to get out ; but Mr. Osborn stopt him at the Door , and in struggling the Prisoner fell in the Street . Mr. Barclay coming to Mr. Osborn 's Assistance , they brought the Prisoner into the Shop again , when the Prisoner making a Motion with his Hand to his Pocket , 27 Nutmegs , 17 d. and a Handkerchief fell on the Ground . The Prisoner own 'd the Handkerchief ; but said he knew nothing of the Money or the Nutmegs . He was carried before Sir Richard Hopkins , where he own 'd that his Companion was not a Captain , but a Fishmonger at t'other end of the Town . His Defence was , that meeting the Captain whom he had never seen , but twice before , they got drunk together , and went to buy Spices for the Captain 's Voyage ; but knew nothing of stealing the Nutmegs . He call 'd a great many to his Character , who deposed that they had known him several Years . That he was a Licensed Pedlar , kept Fairs , and dealt in Hard-ware , Plate , China , Handkerchiefs , and worked Linnen ; that they had often traded with him , and believ 'd him to be an honest Man . The Jury acquitted him . 12. Magdalen Jones , was indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the Murder of Elizabeth Byon , by dragging her out of Bed , and forcing her into the street , between 10 and 11 at Night , when she was weak , and sick , and groaning , and leaving her there , almost naked , and not able to stand , so that with Cold , and Want of due Care , requisite to a Person in such a weak and sick Condition , she Instantly dy 'd , Feb. 7 . John Byon . The Prisoner keeps a Lodging-house overagainst St. Giles's-Round-house , and letts Lodgings for Two-pence a Night . I am a Fan Painter , and the Deceas 'd was my Wife , we took a Lodging there in the Evening , and paid a Groat for that Night ; my Wife was very ill , and could not help groaning when she was a Bed ; upon which the Prisoner came up , and asked what was the Matter . I was afraid she would turn us out , and so I told her my Wife had only got a Cold ; but the Prisoner bid us get out , for we should not lie there ; my Wife said she was not able to get up , and beg 'd her for God 's sake , to let her stay till Morning , tho ' all she could say signified nothing , for the Prisoner would not be pacify 'd till we were gone . So , with much ado , I and the Maid help 'd my Wife up , and put on her Shoes and Stockings and some otherof her Clothes ; and while we were doing it , the Prisoner 's Husband call 'd up , and said , What are you not coming yet ? I 'll fetch you with a Devil to you . Upon which the Prisoner hurried us , and would not give us Time to put on my Wife 's Things ; So the Maid and I help 'd my Wife out to a Bench in the Street , and there I drest her , and before we could get to Church-lane , she drop 'd down dead . We had lain Two-Nights before at the Church Warden of St. Ann 's Door , who could not receive us without a pass from St. Giles 's . Elizabeth Carr . I heard dismal Groans , and the Prisoner took a Candle and found the Prosecutor and his Wife in the Entry , and the Prisoner said to him , You told me , your Wife was only drunk , but she is rotten with the Pox , she shall not lye here , and so take your Groat again , and take your Time to dress her , and carry her out . Then he drest her and led her out , and I helped him , and the Prisoner did not meddle with her , - he is rotten with the Pox as well as his Wife was . Coroner . The Body of the Deceased was full of Blotches . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 13. Henry Crane , was indicted for assaulting Alice Gregory , in an open Field near the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her , a Key , and 5 s. 9 d. Jan 29 . Alice Gregory . Between 3 and 4 , in the Afternoon , as I and Mrs. William 's were walking from Hampstead towards London , the Prisoner with a thick Stick in his Hand came up to us , between Pancras Church and the Turnpike , and stopt Mrs. Williams first , and demanded her Money ; she said she was a poor Woman , and had but three Farthings . Then he turned to me , and said Damn you , your Money , or you are a dead Woman . I gave him half a Crown ; he took it , and said , this is not all ; Damn you , give me the rest , and with that he took from me 3 s. more , and a Key , and then ran away over a Field . I kept my Eye upon him all the while , till he dropt in a Ditch . Some Men coming along , we told them we had been robb 'd , and they pursu 'd the Prisoner and took him . Mrs. Williams . My Cousin Gregory and I came from Hampstead together , and I being foremost was crossing a Bridge , when the Prisoner stept out , and as soon as I got over the Bridge , he damn 'd my Blood , and demanded my Money . I told him I was a poor Woman , and had but three Farthings . He pray 'd the Lord to damn the three Farthings and so went to my Cousin , who was then upon the Bridge , and damn 'd her , and demanded her Money . I bid him have a care what he did , for we had Company behind , and so I called John ! and Dick ! The Prisoner pray 'd God to Damn John and Dick , and swore he would have my Cousin 's Money , or she was a dead Woman . And while he was robbing her , he dropt his Stick in the Water . I stoop 'd and took it up , and was going to give him a Knock ; but seeing 2 Men at a distance , I call 'd to them , and dropt the Stick : The Prisoner took it up , and ran down the Turnpike Path . You Dog , says I , I 'll have you still . The Men coming up , pursu 'd him , and we follow 'd them , and so they took him in the Ditch . Stephen Dowle . Mr. Row and I took the Prisoner in the Ditch . As we came up to him , he said , bear Witness ! These Men are going to rob me ! I found this Key , and this Piece of a Note in the Place where he lay . Mrs. Gregory . These are both mine , the Prisoner took them from me . Mr. Row . I and Mr. Dowle and Mr. Berry being on Horseback , were just got thro ' the Turnpike , when we heard a Cry of Stop Thief . We turn 'd back , and the Woman said she had been rob 'd , and describ 'd the Person . We went up the Lane where we met a Man , who told us such a Person was run across the Field : We follow 'd , and found the Prisoner in a Ditch . John Berry . The Woman said , if I got over the Ditch I might catch him ; but getting sight of another Person , whom I mistook for the Prisoner , I rid after him towards Islington , and before I returned the Prisoner was taken . Lewin Peacock . I saw the Prisoner run over the Field , and go into a Hedge , and I directed Dowle and Row to the Place . Edward Withers . I saw a Man go from these two Women , and observing he mended his Pace , I thought he had robb 'd them . I follow 'd , and was in the middle of the Field when he was taken . John Deeploe . I was going to Copenhagen-house , and Mr. Berry rid after me instead of the Prisoner . Mr. Berry . And I had much ado to get him back . Court , to Deeploe . Who are you ? and why did you run away . Deeploe . I am a Brasier , I work with Mr. Atkinson in Bull and Mouth-street , and I ran after the Prisoner when I heard a cry of Stop Thief - Court . Do you know the Prisoner ? Deeploe . He was my School-fellow , but I have no great Acquaintance with him . Guilty . Death . 14. Timothy Goyley , was indicted for the Murder of Elizabeth Palmer , by throwing her out of a Window two Stories high , into a Yard , in the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields ; whereby both her Thighs were broke , and she Instantly dy 'd , Dec. 24 . Unity Ledger . The Prisoner keeps a Brandy-shop , I lodge in a Garret in his House ; between 11 and 12 on Sunday , he came up two pair of Stairs , and went into a back Room , where the Deceased and another Woman were lying upon a Bed . Court . Drunk ? Ledger . I believe they might be in Liquor . He asked them how they came there , bid them go down , or he said he would kick them down ; but however he did not , but left them there and came into my Room , and taking away some Company there , he went down with them , and I heard him let them out , and then I suppose he went to Bed , for I did not hear him come up again . Richard Mothers . Going to Market , on Christmas-Eve , about 6 in the Morning , I call 'd at the Prisoner 's for a Dram , He said Lord I am very ill - pray call John Brown . I went and brought Brown and John Barns with me . Then the Prisoner said , Lord I am sadly frighten 'd ! I am afraid I am ruin 'd ! Bess Morris ( her right Name is Palmer ) has fell out of Window and kill 'd herself . We open 'd the Yard-door , and there she lay under the Window , with her Face bruised and stone Dead and Stiff . And so we carried her into Parkers-lane . John Barns . My Brother came from the Prisoner for Jack Brown ; I went with them . The Prisoner said he was ruin 'd , Lord , says I , what 's the Matter ? I wish , says he , this Bess Morris has not dropt out of Window and kill 'd her self . We found her dead under the Window with her Legs across ; and I having a Drop of Gin in my Head , he gave me Six-pence to help to lift her into her own Yard ; but afterwards they threaten 'd to throw me behind the Fire for speaking of it . Eleanor Posey . I lodge next Door to the Prisoner , my Window looks into his Yard . I heard a Noise there about 3 in the Morning , and got up and look 'd out , tho ' it was so dark that I could see nothing : But I heard the Prisoner , at his own Window , call to the Woman who was groaning in the Yard , and ask her how She came there . She said she had been to buy a Pennyworth of Muscles , and had got the Cramp , and he bid her lie still till it was Light and not disturb the Neighbours . John Andrews , Surgeon , I view 'd the Body of the Deceas 'd ; she had a large contused Wound in her Forehead , but no Fracture there . Both her Thighs were broke , the left was Fractur 'd near the Middle , and the right near her Knee , which was much contused , and there was a Wound on her Ancle ; and I have reason to believe that these were the Cause of her Death . Another Surgeon gave the same Account of the Wounds and Fractures ; but added , that he could not say they were , tho ' they might be , the Cause of her Death . Prisoner . I heard her cry out in the Yard , and ask 'd her how she came there ? She said she had been for a penn'orth of Muscles , and had got the Cramp in her Knee ; I bid her be quiet , and so she was . And then I went to Bed , and lay 'till six in the Morning . Court . 'T is very strange , that a Woman in such a miserable Condition , wounded , and bruised , and both her Thighs broke , should talk of buying Muscles , and complain of nothing but the Cramp . Prisoner . I suppose she was drunk . Court . It 's intolerable , that such poor Wretches should be suffer 'd to drink till they have lost their Senses . The Houses that allow of such scandalous Practices ought to be suppress 'd . Prisoner . I was but a Servant to one who put me in the House , and I have not been in it above five Weeks . John Brown , whom I sent for , was a Porter belonging to the Shop ; and when he and Barns came , they told me , if I did not move the Body , there would be 5 l. to the Coroner , 5 l. to bury her , and a Fine of 30 l. laid upon the House .

Wages , ' and continu 'd in the said Service till the ' latter end of May last ; about which time , ' by the Threatenings and Instigations of ' Ann Brown , a fellow Servant of this Examinant 's , ' and one James Davies ( formerly ' a Servant with the said Mr. Carpenter , and ' who frequently came to the said Mr. Carpenter 's ' House , tho ' unknown to him , ' and used to have familiar and vitious Conversation , ' with the said Ann Brown , during ' the time this Examinant continu 'd in the ' said Service ) this Examinant was prevail 'd ' upon to go to his said Master 's Bed-chamber , ' to search his said Master 's Pockets and ' take such Money as he should find there , ' and bring to the said Ann Brown and James ' Davies , and that this Examinant should ' have part of such Money .

Judith Defour , was indicted for the Murder of Mary Defour , otherwise Cullinder , by choaking and strangling her with a Piece of Linen , Jan. 29 . She was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . John Wolveridge . I live in the Fields leading to Bethnal-green . About a Month ago , I heard an Outcry that a Child was murder 'd in the Field . I went to the Place , and found a Child dead ; it appear 'd to be upwards of two Years old . I found a black Circle about the Neck , and a Mark like the Print of a Thumb , under the right Ear . Some Gentlemen told me , they had seen three Women coming from the Place where the Child lay ; and I afterwards found , that one of these three were the Prisoner , who was the Mother of the Child . I ask 'd her , how she could be so barbarous as to murder her own Infant ? She said she had only stripp 'd it about 7 at Night , and laid it naked in the Ditch ; and this was all that I could get out of her for a pretty while ; but at last , in a violent Agony of Grief , she said , Then , Sir , I will tell you how I did it ; but there was a Vagabond Creature , one Sukey , that persuaded me to it ; and was equally concern 'd with me . On Sunday Night we took the Child into the Fields , and stripp 'd it , and ty 'd a Linen Handkerchief hard about its Neck to keep it from crying , and then laid it in a Ditch . And after that , we went together , and sold the Coat and Stay for a Shilling , and the Petticoat and Stockings for a Groat . We parted the Money , and join 'd for a Quartern of Gin . The Prisoner made the like Confession before Justice Chamberlain , insisting upon it , that the other Creature Sukey was equally guilty . Elizabeth Scot . The Prisoner worked with me ( at a Throwster 's ) she came to work at half an Hour past Seven , the Night the Murder was done , and work 'd 'till Morning - She said , she had done something that deserved New gate , and at last , told us , she had left her Child in the Field all Night - We went to the Place , found the Child dead , and then went to the Church-wardens . Susan Jones . When she came to work , over Night , we ask 'd her if she had carry 'd her Child back to the Work house ( for the Child was kept in the Parish Work-house , and she had got Leave to take it out for 2 or 3 Hours ) she told me , she had not , but her Mother had . She worked 'till One in the Morning , and then had a Dram , and would have had another , but I would not let her . Thn she desir 'd a Penny to buy a Roll and Cheese . I gave her a Penny ; but instead of fetching a Roll and Cheese , she brought in a Roll and a h ' p'orth of Gin - Then she said , she had done something that deserved Newgate . I told her I hoped she had not wrong ' my Mistress , but if she had , her best way would be to make a plain Confession , and then I believe my Mistress , would be the more favourable to her . She said it was no such thing as that ; but she had left her Child all Night in the Field . What ? says I , in such a dismal cold Night ! How can you be so cruel ? She said she had not done it , but one Sukey persuaded her to it . So I bid Elizabeth Scot take a piece of Bread and Butter , and go with me and the Prisoner to fetch the Child , for the Prisoner had not told me the Child was dead , and I thought it would be a hungry as well as Cold . But when we came to the Place , we found the Child stript and lying dead in a Ditch , with a Linnen-rag tied hard about its poor Neck . Jane Prig . The Prisoner came on Sunday to take the Child out , but I would not let her , without an Order from the Church-Wardens ; so she went away , and came again in half an Hour , and brought a Note , as from the Church-Warden , and upon that I let her have the Child out ; but I afterwards found that the Church-Warden had given no such Note - The Child had been New-clothed but the Thursday before . Job London , Surgeon . About the Fore-part of the Child 's Neck , I observed part of a black Circle , like that in executed Persons , and I believe the Violence it was done with , was the Cause of her Death . Then the Prisoner 's Confession , before the Justice , being proved , was read in Court . Middlesex } , to wit . The Examination and Confession of Judith Defour , taken this 30th Day of January 1733 , before me one of his Majesty 's Justices of the Peace for the said County . ' THIS Examinant confesseth , that about ' two Years and three Months since , she ' was deliver 'd of a female bastard Child , be- ' got on her Body , by one John Cullender , ' who lives in Spittle-Fields Market , by ' Trade a Weaver ; and that the said ' Child was haptized by the Name of Mary , ' and that her said Child , Mary hath been ' for some Weeks past in the Work house , ' belonging to the Hamlet of Bethnal-green , in ' the said Country of Middlesex ; and that she ' went on Sunday last , about 9 or 10 in the ' Morning to the Work-house , to see her ' said Child , and found the Child had been ' within a few Days new clothed . And that ' she took away her Child , and kept it with ' her , till about 6 or 7 a Clock in the ' Evening , when being in Company with ' one Susannah - her Surname to her ' unknown ; but that she has a Sister now ' in Shoreditch Work-house , who ( that is , ' Susannah , not her Sister ) pursaded her , ' this Examinant , to sell the Child 's Clothes , ' and carry it into the Fields and leave it ' there . That they went both of them together ' into a Field near Joan Harding 's , where ' they stripp 'd the said Child , and ty 'd a linen ' Rag very hard about the Child 's Neck , ' to prevent its crying out , which strangled ' her , and that afterwards , they went together , ' leaving the Child behind in a Ditch , ' near dead , to one Mary Witts , who lives ' in Swan-Yard , in the Parish of St. Leonard ' Shoreditch , and sold the Clothes , that is to ' say , a Coat , Stays , Petticoat , and Stockings ' to the said Witts , and received for them ' Sixteen-pence , and that they parted the Money ' equally between them .

We had not gone far together , when the Prisoner took hold of my Arm , and ask 'd me the same Question , I answer 'd as before , and he made the same Reply , as the other . They led me to the Field , in the Parish of St. George in the East , and then the Prisoner damn 'd me , and bid me deliver my Money ; I told him I had none . And then he bid me strip ; But I not pulling off my Clothes so soon as he expected , he cut me twice across this Hand with a Knife , - here are the Marks plain enough to be seen - then he took my Cap , Handkerchief , Coat , Waist-coat , Shoes , and Buckles , and order 'd me to lie in the Ditch , which I did . Now , you Son of a Bitch , says he , If I was in your Hands , as you are in mine , you 'd murder me - No ; says I , my dear , I would not hurt a hair of your Head . He took me several times by the Throat , and I believe would have kill 'd me , if Abbot had not prevented him . Then he order 'd Abbot to bind me Hand and Foot , and so they left me , between 12 and 1 in the Morning . But my Shoes being off I got loose and call 'd upon the Beadle , and so went home , for I was but about half a Mile from my own House when they robb 'd me . Margaret Read .

On Saturday Morning , my Wife told me , as she came by Mr. Hackshaw 's empty House , which is but 3 Doors from mine , she saw the Bar of the Cellar-door loose . Then , says I , some Rogues have been stealing the Leaden-sink in the Kitchen . That would be worse , says she , than when they stole the Pipes a Year ago . As I had the Key of the House , I went to examine how it was ; I found the Lead of the Sink was taken out , and laid upon the Floor ready to be carried away . O , thinks I , the Gentlemen will come to fetch it at Night , and I ca n't do less than to give them a Welcome . So I spoke to Robin Ballance to bring his Gun and to sit up with me that Night , which he did . I went out about 12 but found nothing stirring . I went again in less than an Hour and heard a ticking in the Cellar , and by and by a light was struck . I goes home to my Wife - Her Name is Nanny , says I , now my Chaps are in the House , but call the Watch - I warrant you the Rogues have got Pistols , if they have , says I , we 'll send the Dog in first and he wo n't value their Pistols , for he do n't know a Pistol from a Broom-stick . Then Bob shall go with his Gun , and Fire upon them , and I 'll hide myself behind the Door , till the Danger is over . But all this wou 'd not make her easy . And so being willing to obey my Wife 's orders , I ran to the Watch as fast as if I was running for an Estate , and brought them with me : But when we came to the Door they were so full of their good breeding , that they stood disputing who should enter first : I was vext at it , for I thought their Noise would alarm the Rogues within , and so it proved , for presently I heard a Window slap to . Now , thinks I , they have made their Escape Backwards , and I have watch 'd all Night for nothing . So I push 'd in foremost , and ran into the Kitchen ; I saw no Body at first , but looking into the Closet , there stood the Prisoner , squeez 'd in a Corner bolt upright , with a Plaisterer 's Lathing-hammer in his Hand . I Knock 'd him down , and catch 'd him by the Collar as he fell . His Head run with Blood , and I was sorry to see it ; but I thought it was better so , than he should serve me worse with his Hammer . I took the Hammer from him - Here it is - And this Knife , but it is not worth a Fill of a Farthing . When I had pull 'd him out and secur 'd him , the Watch came in to my Assistance . Guilty .

Laid it upon the Table and fell down Whitehouse said it was pity she should lye there ; but Arnot told him it was her way to lye and Water herself . Whitehouse going to help her up , Arnot gave him a Push , and down fell he and the old Woman together . The Prisoner coming in , she struck at him with a Stick , and thereupon he took it from her , broke it across his Knee , and threw it upon the Fire . Says I , That 's my Stick Then I 'll give you another for it , says he , but I took it for the old Woman 's Keffel - We call 'd it her Keffel because she was a Welsh-woman . Then he got her Stick and burnt that too ; and while it was burning , Alcroft came in for a Candle . Says I , Let 's go , for we ca n't be at quiet here . No do n't , says the Prisoner , and I 'll turn her out . So he took her out into the Entry , and left her there , and fasten 'd the Door . She kick 'd against the Door , and cry 'd , Murder , and afterwards I heard her fall down , as I thought , and I said , I wish 'd the old Woman has not kill 'd herself . Court . Did he lead her out , or drag her out ? Box . He led her . Ann Johnson . No ; she was upon her Knees and he dragg 'd her out . Court , to Box . Did you see Ann Johnson there ? Box . No . Prisoner to A. Johnson . Was you in the Kitchen ? Ann Johnson . No ; but I was in the Entry . Box . There 's a Curtain to the Kitchen-door and she could not see over it . Court . Did you see any Water thrown at the Deceas 'd ? Box . No . Court . Did you see any Blows given her by the Prisoner ? Box . No . Court . Nor see him beat her Head against the Partition ? Box . No . Ann Johnson . But I saw him beat her with a Stick , and drag her out , and knock her Head against the Partition , and throw Water upon her . Alcroft . And I saw him give her three or four Blows with Box 's Stick . Box . The Stick was upon the Fire when Alcroft came in . Alcroft . No , it was not ; for after he had beat her with it , I saw him break it , and throw it on the Fire . Court . Did you see the Deceas 'd strike the Prisoner ? Alcroft . No . Box . But I did . Court . Do you think the Woman beat herself ? Box . No ; but it 's my Opinion she fell down two or three Stairs , for ( the Stairs are in the Entry ) I heard something tumble . Court . But you did not see it ? Box . No . John Masters , having depos 'd to the same Effect as Francis Box , added , Hearing something fall , I said , I was afraid the old Woman had hurt herself , upon which the Prisoner and a Watchmaker went out with a Candle , and when they came in again , they said she was dead drunk . George Arnot threw some Water upon her , and the Prisoner was going to do the same , but did not . For my part I thought she was dead , for her Head hung thus - John Mapelow . The Deceas 'd lay on her Right-side , with her Face towards the Stairs , pretty close to them , it not upon them . Thomas Walker . She us 'd to be drunk , and cry Murder when no Body touch 'd her , and so she did that Night . Mary Walker . She cry 'd Murder , as she frequently did when she was drunk - I went into the Kitchen in the Afternoon , when she took up a Poker , and cry 'd , God damn you all , I 'll do some of you : Mischief - I came at Night and found her in the Entry , she was neither up nor down , but tapping against the Door , and cry 'd , You Dogs , you Sons of Bitches ; open the Door , God damn you , and let me come in . Mr . Box answer 'd , God damn you , for a noisy Bitch , you sha n't come in here . I went to Market , and when I return 'd , she was still crying Murder , and my Husband told me , she had been crying Murder ever since - I saw one Gethings helping her up a Stair or two , and afterwards I saw her rowling about the Entry , and crying , Curse you , curse you all . She had not a Drop of Blood on her then , tho ' she was bloody when I saw her dead in the Kitchen . Box . The Prisoner was not out of our Company , but when he carry 'd her into the Entry . Court . Why did you not appear and give Evidence before the Lord Mayor and the Coroner ? Box . No Body gave me Orders to appear . Prisoner . He said he heard there was a Warrant against him , and he was afraid to appear . John Trotman . I saw the Deceas 'd drunk at 2 a Clock , I went to the Prisoner 's several times from 8 till 9 , and she was still crying Murder , tho ' no Body was with her . At half an Hour past 8 , she went up 2 Stairs and fell down with the Right side of her Head against the Post of the Stairs . She was mortal drunk , and could not get up again , and she was dead in a Quarter of an Hour after . Richard Taylor . Ann Johnson told me , she was not in the Kitchen , but saw what past thro ' the Window and Key-hole of the Door . Ann Johnson . I never spoke to this Man , and besides , I could not tell him any such thing , for there is no Key-hole thro ' the Door , and the Window is always shut at 7 a Clock . Indeed I was not in the Kitchen , and I never said I was ; but that I stood in the Entry . I had no business in the House , but hearing Murder cry 'd , I went out of Curiosity to see what was the Matter . Juryman . Did the Prisoner strike her with Violence . Alcroft . I ca n't say I thought it so violent as to murder her - He call 'd her an old troublesome Bitch . Ann Johnson . He took her by the Cap and struck her Head , as hard as ever he could , against the Wainscot , but ca n't say that he struck her so hard with the Stick . Several other Witnesses swore that the Deceas 'd was very often drunk , and very noisy and troublesome , and several others gave the Prisoner the Character of a civil quiet Man . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaugher . [ Branding . See summary . ] 56 , 57. Lydia Goodwin , alias Clerk , alias Smith , and Hester Bonner , alias Bedenham , alias Merchant , were indicted for assaulting Catherine Hyam , in Blackhorse-Alley , near the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Dimity-pocket , two Keys , and 6s . 6d . Feb. 2 . Katherine Hyam , ( a Jewess . ) Going thro ' Fleet-street with Betty Hays , between 8 and 9 at Night , the Prisoners were standing at the End of Black-horse-Alley , and Lydia said to Hester , Here comes Jew Kate , and t'other Bitch . So they both fell upon me and beat me , and took my Pocket with two Keys in it , and three half Crowns , and then they ran up the Alley . I have known Lydia a good while , for she frequented the same House as I did ; and besides I was fellow Servant with her two Months , at Mr. Soloman 's in Cruchet-friars , and I knew Hester too very well . I did not cry out , for the Blows they gave were so violent , that they took away my Speech for several Minutes , and I have had a sore Breast ever since - But I crost the way and told Betty Hays I had been robb 'd of my Pocket . She ask 'd me , If I had not dropp 'd it ? And I said , No , for I saw it in Lydia 's Hand . She had a Warrant against them a pretty while by her , and being they us 'd me so ill , she serv 'd it upon them that Night . Elizabeth Hays . Says Lydia , Here comes Jew Kate , and t'other Bitch ; and Hester made answer , Let them come and they will , I 'll do for the Bitches . And so she hit me a Slap o'the Face , and she had often threatened to use me ill , whereof I cross 'd the Way ; then they fell aboard o ' Kate Hyam ; and I heard her say , Do n't take it ; but she spoke so faint . I could hardly tell what she said . And then she came over to me , and said , Dear Heart , I have lost my Pocket . Hester . Jew Kate 's Husband got drunk , and stood talking with a Man in Middle-Row , and the Man said , Let me have the Watch , that your Wife pick 'd my Pocket of . And I standing to hear what they talk 'd of , Bess Hays comes up to me , and says , You eternal Bitch , what do you stand here for ? Whereof I fell upon her , and beat her to her Heart 's content , and so she got a Warrant for me . Lydia . Jew Kate was got with Child by some Body or other , and her Husband beat her , to make her swear the Child to three several Booksellers in Fleetstreet , and that way she got the sore Breast . - Smith . The Prisoner lodg 'd at my House a 12 Month , and behav 'd very Civil . Elisha Horn . The Prisoners were both in my Company that Evening , at the Sword and Buckler , on Ludgate-hill from Six till past Nine , and you 'll find that goes beyond the Time of the Robbery if you please to over haul it . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 58. Isabel Matchett , was indicted for stealing a Waistcoat , 3 Shirts , and a pair of Stockings , the Goods of several Persons , Dec. 15 . Pleaded Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 59. Henry Huggins , was indicted for stealing 7 Guineas and 10 Shillings , the Property of John Phipp , Dec. 8 . John Phipp . I came from Baldock in Hertfordshire , and being at my Inn , in St. John-street , I was told that the Prisoner wanted to speak with me , and that he was a vast rich Man , and kept a matter of three hundred Horses . I spoke to him , and he appointed to meet me next Morning , about nine a Clock , at the Leg-Tavern in Fleet-street : But he did no great matters there , for he had a Mind to go somewhere else . So coming along Fleetstreet , he called to a Man , You , you , I want to speak with ye : I must have a hundred Pound of you on Monday Morning . Sir , said the Man , you shall have it . So we came to the Crown Tavern in Smithfield , by 11 a Clock . There was three other Men with him , though I do n't know whether they went in with him , or came to him soon after . But before he went in , he sent a Man with a Letter to his House in Fleet-Lane . And these three Men pretended to be the Prisoner 's Servants . And one of them said to him ; Sir , I must have six score Pounds to pay your Workmen . And said the Prisoner , I ha n't so much about me , but here 's a bill of fourscore Pounds . Then another of the Men laid down nine or ten Guineas . But the first Man said that would not do . And upon that the Prisoner desired me to lend him some Money to make it up , and he said I should have it again by six a Clock that Night . So I lent him ten Guineas ; but his head Man said that was not enough . I had seven Guineas and ten Shilings more in my hand ; and the Prisoner sitting next to me he claw 'd the Money from me . Court . Now you are come to the Point . Tell us in what Manner he took it ? You say he claw 'd the Money from you . Explain what you mean by that . Phipp . I held the Money in my Hand , thus , and he pulled it out . Court . You saw him take it ? Phipp . Yes . Court . Did he take it by violence , whether you would or no , or did you consent to it ? Phipp . I ca n't say there was Violence neither ; nor I ca n't say that I rightly consented : But he took it out of my hand , that he did . Court . Did you complain to any Body that he had robb 'd you ? Phipp . No , I ca n't say that . Court . Did you think you were robbed ? Phipp . I ca n't say rightly that I did ; for I thought he would have paid me again ; because I had heard he was such a vast rich Man . Court . How long did he stay after he had got your Money ? Phipp . They all slipt away presently , in three or four Minutes . Prisoner . What did you about this when you came to your Inn ? Phipp . Nothing . Prisoner . Had you any Note for the Money , or for any part of it ? Phipp . No . Prisoner . Did you go again to the same Tavern , that Night . Phipp . Indeed I ca n't tell if I were to die . Prisoner . Was you drunk ? Phipp . No , I was not drunk . - When the Prisoner was at the Leg , he sent a Porter for his Comrades . Edward Jones . I am Porter at the Leg-Tavern . A Man who was drinking there with the Prosecutor sent me with a Note to a Brandy-Shop in Fleet-Lane ; and the Woman at the Brandy-Shop sent me to an Inn in St. John Street . The Landlady there said the Gentleman was not there , but if he came , she would send him to the Leg . In my way back , I called again at the Brandy-shop , where I heard that the Person had been there , and was gone to our House . I went directly home , and presently a Man came in and went to the Room where the Prosecutor was . There was then four in Company ; I think the Prisoner was one of them , and they all went away together . Phipp . You would know him better , if he pulled off his Gown and his Wig , and put on the dress he was in at your House . Prisoner . I never saw Phipp in my life , 'till I was carried before Alderman Brocas ; and there a Man said to him , Do as I bid you , or you 'll never get your Money . William Whitlock . I served a Warrant upon the Prisoner , and he metramops 'd himself to go before Alderman Brocas , and was in the same metramops dress then , as he is in now . But he changed his Dress , I suppose , that the old Man might not know him . Prisoner . I put on the Gown because I had got a cold . Hugh Reason . I am a Sheriff 's Officer . I attended at Hicks's-Hall in December Sessions ; and going into the Inn where the Prosecuter was , he said to me , Honest Friend you had some of my Money last Night . The Landlady ask 'd him how he could say so ? And he answered , I am sure he was one of them . - But if I have lent it , I have got good Security for it . Robert Milward , Corn-Chandler , in St. John-Street . On the 8th of December I bought some Peas of the Prosecutor , and went in the Evening to fetch them away . He came in a great hurry to the young Woman , and said , Where 's your Mother ? I want some Money . - What to do ? - To lend . - To whom ? You know who , says he , the Man that was here to Day . Prisoner . This was at Night , and he swears it was 11 or 12 a Clock when I had the Money of him . Zach Clark . On Saturday Dec. 8. between three and four in the afternoon , the Prosecutor came in liquor to the Mistress of the Inn , and wanted more Money . Lord , says she , he has had ten Guineas already , and says he has lent it to a Friend , and now he wants seven Guineas more . Tho Mapson . The Prisoner sent for me Yesterday , - and there was the Prosecutor , and he said , I am pretty safe now , for the Money is lodged in a Friend 's Hands . I did lend it the Man , but if I had arrested him , I had lost it ; tho ' I had never taken this way , but I was persuaded to it . William Webb , Drawer at the Crown in Smithfield . The Prosecutor and three or four others came in between 11 and 12 , and staid till one . They had three or four Pints , and called for Pen , Ink and Paper , and to pay . - When I went in , two or three of them went out ; but I heard no complaint of a Robbery . The Jury acquitted him . 60. William Collins , was indicted for stealing a silver Watch , value 50 s. the Property of John Beaumont , Jan. 25 . Mary Beaumont . I lodge in a Room on Windmill-hill . The Prisoner and other Carpenters were at work in fitting up other Rooms in the same House . I went and got some Shavings of them , and the Prisoner soon after came into my Room . I was sitting upon a Stool making a Shift , and the Watch hung up by the Chimney . He look 'd on the Watch , and said it was between 3 and 4 a Clock , I said , Yes . Now , says he , in case you was afraid of being robb 'd of this Watch , where would be the properest Place to hide it ? And then he spoke smutty Words . I said , I hop 'd I never should be robb 'd of it , for if I or my Husband should be taken ill , we had nothing else that we could make a little Money of . He stood a while , and then pointing to the other End of the Room , he cry 'd , God damn the Cat . I turn 'd my Head to see what the Cat was doing , but there was no Cat there . Then the Prisoner went to work in the next Room , and in eight or nine Minutes , ( before any body else had been in the Room ) I mist the Watch . I ran to him , and said , Lord , how could you frighten me so , what have you done with the Watch ? He swore he knew nothing of the Watch And Hugh Meer ( another Carpenter , was at work there ) pushed me back ; and the Prisoner called me nasty Bitch , and talked baudy , and said I had given the Watch to an old Man to lye with me , which I never did . Prisoner . Did you see me take the Watch ? Mary . No I would not say such a Thing for all the World ! But I saw his Hand upon it . Court . Did the Prisoner abscond upon your charging him with taking the Watch ? Mary . Not directly . But they all left the Work before Candle-light , while my Husband was gone for a Constable . About seven they came by the Door again , and said , Ye Bitch , where 's the Watch ? And , ye Bitch , if it was not for your Neighbours we 'd set your House on fire . Next Day the Prisoner came again to work , and then we took him up , and he cry 'd and begg 'd we would not prosecute him ; but we had him before the Justice , and there he told the same Story about the old Man . John Beaumont . I left the Watch with my Wife , at three in the Morning , when I went to work . Prisoner . Are you married to her ? John . Yes . Prisoner . On Thursday in the afternoon , I and three more Carpenters , Hugh Meer , Samuel Gandy and Thomas Nix , were at work in the House where the Woman lives . About three an elderly Gentleman came up and went into her Room . Presently the Door was shut and a Cloth hung over the Key-hole . But some of us looking thro ' a Crevice in the Partition , observed some odd Passages between the old Man and her . He staid near an Hour , and when he went away , she came into our Room and went to plane a Board . I told her that was a Forfeit , and so I followed her into her Room , and asked her for a Dram : But I went back immediately , and she soon followed me . An Alehouse-Keeper 's Man came up for some Shavings , she rioted him out of the House ; and as he was going down Stairs , she said she must go back and shut her Door , for fear she should be robbed . So she went , and I went down to work in the Room below . She came down soon after , staid a little while , and went up again . In a few Minutes I heard a noise above , and ran up , she was then charging Hugh Meer and my Master 's Apprentice with taking the Watch ; and she said it was in her Room when she went to shut her Door , which was near an Hour after I was in her Room . And they were bantering her about the old Man . Then she said she was sure we had it among us ; and at last she charged me with it . Hugh Meers . While she was in our Room her little Dog bark 'd , and up came an old Gentleman , who look 'd to be about sixty . Says she , My Dog knows my Customers . So she and the old Man went in and shut the Door . I thought some Game was going forward , and so I looked at the Key-Hole , but something was hung before it within Side . Then we found out a Crevice , and through that we could see 'em plainly . She was sitting in a Chair , and he stood before her . He thrust his Hand down her Bosom , and then up her Coats ; she took out what she could find , and play 'd with it , while the old Boy bill 'd her , as if he would have eaten her up . After he was gone , she came into our Room , and we began to run the rig upon her , about what we had seen , and I called her - and - , which made her so angry , that she swore I and Gandy had stole the Watch . But when the Prisoner came up she charged it upon him . It was the first time that ever I had heard any of him . As to his being in her Room , she came to plane a Board , and he told her she must pay her Footing , and so he followed her and asked her for a Dram . I saw him in the middle of her Room , but he was not near the Chimney where the Watch hung , and he did not stay two Minutes . Sam Gandy . - After the old Man was gone , and the Prisoner had been in her Room , she came again into ours . Mr. Gill 's Man came for some Shavings , she began to riot him , and bid him tell his Mistress to take the Half Crown under the Candle-stick . - As he was going down , she said she must shut her Door , or she should lose something . She shut it , went down and came up again , and soon after came into our Room , and said , Lord , I have lost my Watch ! and one of you must have it . Tho Nix . The Prisoner and I were at work below , when Meers and Gandy call 'd us up to see the old Man 's Actions - And when he was gone , and she come into our Room , Meers began to game her . He ask 'd her how she liked - , and told her of an old Parson that used to lie cross a Bed , and give a Woman Half a Crown a time for whipping him . - The Prosecutrix first charged Meers and Gandy with the Watch , and afterwards swore it upon the Prisoner . The Prosecution appearing scandalous and malicious , the Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and the Court granted him a Copy of his Indictment . 61. Daniel Cook was indicted for stealing a Gold Snuff-Box , value 10 l. and a Gold Tweezer-Cafe value 4 l. the Property of Elisha Manisier , in the House of William Clew , Jan. 25 . Elisha Manisier . On the 25th of January , in the Morning , I bid my Girl call the Prisoner down to fetch up the Work , as usual . In three Quarters of an Hour I went up myself , and not finding the Work on the Board , I asked him why he did not fetch it up . He went down , and returning , said , he had search 'd the Drawer where he had seen the Maid put it , but he could not find it . - I advertised the Goods , and on the Monday following he told me , with a great deal of seeming Joy , that he had heard - .bl Court . Were the Goods your Property . Elisha Manisier . No ; the Snuff-Box was my Lord Harvey 's , and the Tweezer-cafe Mr. Duton 's . Court . Then the Prisoner must be acquitted , for he 's indicted for stealing your Goods - However , I would not immediately discharge him out of Custody for a Mistake , you may still indict him for stealing the Goods of my Lord Harvey and Mr. Duton .
