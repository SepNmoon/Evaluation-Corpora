The Prisoner being arraign 'd stood mute ; the reason of which being demanded by the court , he reply 'd , that a considerable sum of money had been taken from by the constable who apprehended him , and unless that was restor 'd to him , he was determin 'd not to plead . The court then order 'd a clause in an act of parliament to be read to him , wherein it is ordain 'd , that monies or other effects found upon persons charg 'd with highway robberies , shall on the parties conviction , be divided among the persons concern 'd in apprehending them ; and in case of an acquittal , those effects shall be again restor 'd to the parties .

After this the necessary orders were given , and the executioner sent for to perform the usual office of tying the Prisoner 's thumbs before the execution of the sentence ; but before that was proceeded upon , the Prisoner pleaded not guilty , and the following evidence was given . Mr. Zachary . On friday the 17th of July last , about 6 o'clock in the evening , I was returning on horseback from Edmonton to London , and to avoid the dust , I took to the lanes , and did not come the great road . At Palmer 's Green I first observ 'd the Prisoner behind me on a little horse . He was meanly drest , and I took very little notice of him . I was by my self , and he kept following me for near three miles , 'till he came to the new sluice at Newington , and at the bottom of the hill , he ask 'd me whether that road went to Islington ? I told him , yes ; that Newington church was before , and that Islington was a quarter of a mile farther . Upon that immediately his horse 's head was close to mine , and with oaths and imprecations he threaten 'd my life ; at the same time producing a pistol in his right hand , which he held directly to me , and swore he would shoot me dead . I ask 'd him what he wanted , and he still threaten 'd my life , and took hold of my horse 's bridle , and put the pistol to my breast . I ask 'd him a second time what he wanted , and he then said he knew I had a charge of money about me , and was determin 'd to have it . I was very much surpriz 'd to see his pistol in so dangerous a position , for his hand trembled so much , that unless he dropp 'd his pistol , he could not avoid drawing the trigger . Upon this I told him I would deliver if he would drop his pistol and behave well : He then did drop his pistol , and said he would behave as a gentleman . I then deliver 'd him two guineas and a gold watch , and ask 'd him if he wanted any thing farther with me ; and he said , I must alight , for he knew I had more money about me . I was unwilling to do that till he gave me his promise that he would not use me ill ; and then I did alight , and each of us had our horses bridles in our hands . He then search 'd me for more money , but found none , for I had a little silver that he did not take notice of . After all this had pass 'd , I ask 'd him whether he had done with me : He reply 'd he had not , for he must have my horse and whip , and accordingly he did take them , and left me his own horse and a little switch whip in the stead . Q . What was your horse worth ? Mr. Zachary . I gave 15 guineas for it but a little before , and my whip I paid 17 s. for . He likewise took from me a pair of gloves , which were found upon him when he was taken . Q . Which way did he go then ? Mr. Zachary . He took my horse which was saddled and bridled , about 20 yards from me , and then mounted and rode off towards Palmer 's Green . I advertis 'd my horse the next day , and in about ten days after that , the Prisoner was taken , and I had it again by his directions . Q . What did the Prisoner say to you ? Mr. Zachary . When he was taken I saw him at Justice Chandler 's , and I went to him in Newgate two days afterwards , and then he told me my horse was at Mimms Wash. Pursuant to this direction I went out that night at 9 o'clock , and found my horse , saddle , bridle and whip in a stable there , and they were deliver 'd to me . Q . Have you got your watch again ? Mr. Zachary . I heard that the Prisoner was at Justice Chandler 's and I went to him . This watch was then produced , and I knew it to be mine . Q . Are you sure the Prisoner is the man ? Mr. Zachary . Yes , I am positive he is the person . Pris . Did I ever say any thing to you where your horse was ? Mr. Zachary . He confess 'd it to persons that came directly to me . Pris . You ought to have had those persons here then . Martha Underwood . I know the Prisoner very well . On tuesday morning the 28th of July , I saw him a little beyond Bow-Church in Cheapside , and followed him to Mr. Taylor 's at Norton-Falgate , where he was taken . Q . How came you to follow him ? Underwood . I had not heard of this robbery ; but the people said he was the person that murder 'd Mr. Cruiashanks . He was taken at Mr. Taylor 's at Norton-Falgate , and from thence was carried before Justice Chandler . I was present , and saw 5 watches , 9 guineas and an half in gold , and 46 s. 6 d. in silver found upon him . Q . Did he say where he had those watches ? Underwood . No , Sir . - I can say nothing as to this gentleman 's watch , but I saw 5 taken out of his pocket in a snuff colour 'd handkerchief . John Haines Constable . On tuesday morning the 28th of July , I took the Prisoner on that woman 's ( Underwood 's ) information , and when he was before the justice , I found this and 4 other watches upon him . Mr. Zachary . This is my watch ; I know it by the mark and number , M. Storr 3321 . Haines . I took the money from him myself , and likewise these gloves . Mr. Zachary . These gloves fit me , and as much as any body can swear to a pair of gloves , I swear to these . Haines . Here are some pieces of silver which I took out of one of his pockets . Mr. Zachary . This silver is the button to my whip , and it exactly answers to what I advertised . Tho Rogers . I am beadle of Shoreditch parish , and the constable sent for me to bring hand-cuffs for the Prisoner , and I went to Justice Chandler 's but did not see him search 'd . When the Prisoner was before the Justice , he denied that his name was Cooke , and said that he came from Bromley , and never saw Stratford : upon which the Justice order 'd me to go down to Stratford to enquire , and I brought up some of the inhabitants to prove him to be the man ; and one of them shook hands with him , but the Prisoner swore he would not shake hands with them , nor would not own them . Mr. Haines sent for me to assist him , and the Prisoner told us he was a gentleman born , and desired to be used as such , upon which we indulg 'd him with a coach , and carried him to Justice Chandler 's , and then I saw Haines produce the watches . Pris . I have no body here to speak for me , but must rely on the favour of the court . Mr. Zachary advertis 'd the man who robb 'd him to be 5 feet 3 inches high , and pock holes in his face , and I am not like the person , for I am 5 feet 7 inches and an half . As to the watches I bought them , and if I had time I would produce the persons whom I bought them of . I came from Birmingham in Warwickshire , and buy and sell watches , and if I had had time I would have made a better defence , but now I must leave it to the mercy of the court . Guilty Death . 4 , 5. Jane Stevely was indicted for stealing 5 pair of linen sheets , a blanket , and a linen bedcase ; the goods of our sovereign lord the King ; October the 16th .

All that I have to say is , that I lost 8 live geese and 9 fowls , on the first of August from Avery farm , near Chelsea-water-works . I know nothing of the Prisoner . Edward Barnet . I took the Prisoner in the Broadway , Westminster , on the first of August between 3 and 4 in the morning . He had a bag with 8 geese in it , on his shoulders , which he threw down when he saw me . There was another person with him , but he made his escape , and in pursuing him we found a bag of fowls thrown over into a yard , which together with the geese were carried to the Beadle 's house , where they were own 'd by the Prosecutor . Keeling . I saw the geese at the Beadle 's house and know them to be mine by a particular mark in the webs of their feet . - Bates . Between 3 and 4 in the morning , I saw the last witness lay hold of the Prisoner ; and he dropp 'd the geese , and said he would swear a robbery against him for taking them from him . They were carried to the Beadle 's house , where the Prosecutor own 'd them . - They were all hot when we took them . Prisoner . I was going to see for harvest work , and pick 'd this bag of geese up ; but as to the fowls I know nothing of them . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 8.

I lost a black gelding with a stripe down his face out of my stable near the Fox and Goose , at the Dog-house bar ; but I was out of town , so that I know nothing of the fact but what my servants told me . Richard George Gregory . One day in April last , about 7 o'clock in the morning , the Prisoner and I went to this man 's stable in Oldstreet , and about 11 o'clock the Prisoner broke the door open . Q . Was the door lock 'd ? Gregory . I ca n't tell whether it was or no , but he took away the horse , and bid me stand stag for fear any body should come by . Q . What did you do with the horse ? Gregory . We sold him to a collar maker to be knock 'd o'the head , for he was but a poor horse . Thompson . The horse was blind indeed , but I would not have taken 10 l. for him , for all they sold him to a collar maker . Gregory . We did sell him to a collar maker for 7 s. 6 d. and I had part of the odd 6 d. and the Prisoner had the rest . Jonathan Emley . I saw the horse in the stable at 7 o'clock that morning , and at 11 when I came home with a load of hay he was gone . Thomas Gilton . My father is the collar maker , and is lame , or else he would have been here himself . The Prisoner sold us a horse between 12 and 1 in the day time , about the middle of April . He ask 'd 12 s. for it , and my father bid him 5 s. for we never give more for any horse . The Prisoner sell his price to 9 s. and at last took 7 s. 6 d. for him , and I took the horse to the Duke of Cumberland 's killing and kill 'd him . He was beat with broomsticks from shoulder to flank , and did not look worth 10 s. to us . Prisoner . I never saw the horse , nor never ( ever ) was near the place . The jury found him guilty to the value of 7 s. 6 d. Death . 9 , 10. William Gray and John White were indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling house of William Ashley , about 12 at night , and stealing 68 pounds weight of iron , call 'd bolt staves , val . 24 s. the goods of the said William Ashley . July the 7th . William Ashley . The Prisoner White was my apprentice . On the 7th of July my house , which is close to my shop at Limehouse bridge , was broke open . The neighbours call 'd out to me , that there were thieves in my house , upon which I got up , and call 'd Rose ! Keeper ! and t'other dog 's name - a young puppy that I have , and they all fell a roaring like mad . I then thought there could not be thieves in the house , but however I ran up stairs , and White was gone , I perceived ; so I struck a light and went to the street door , and saw him ( White ) coming in . I ask 'd him where he had been ? He said he could not sleep , and had been to take a walk : What , says I , do you walk without shoes ? He said he was very hot , so I took him in , and told him , he or somebody else had robb 'd me , and I took a stick and 'nointed him heartily . After this I set him to work , and got a pipe of tobacco , and watch 'd him a little while , and then I call 'd up my foreman and went to bed . When I got up again , I order 'd 1200 of bolt staves , which I knew the weight of , to be weigh 'd over again ; and then White desired my foreman to save him , and say there was an hundred weight more than there was . The foreman informing me of this , I told the boy , if my cane was a sword I would run him through , and ask 'd him what he had done with the Iron , and he told me , Gray had got them in his house . Upon this I went to Justice Jones and got a search warrant ; and when I came to Gray 's house there he was sitting with his back against a closet , but I took him from thence , and found 96 lb . of my iron standing upright in the closet before me . When I had found my iron , Gray fell on his knees , and both he and his wife offer 'd me a bond of 50 l. to let him go ; but I told him he must expect nothing from me but what the law directed . Thomas Smalwood confirm 'd the above deposition . Pris . White . This man is innocent of it ; I carried it to his house . Gray . He brought it to my house , and desir 'd me to let him leave it there , and said he would fetch it again next morning . The court was of opinion that Gray could not be affected by this indictment , therefore directed the jury to acquit him , and recommended it to the Prosecutor to prefer a bill against him , as an accessary after the fact . Gray acquitted , White guilty Felony only . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 11.

Mary White , alias Chaise , alias Ryan , of Fulham was indicted for stealing 3 five guinea pieces , the money of Robert Maynard Esq ; in his dwelling house , July 11th . Mr. Maynard . On the 11th of last month , between 9 and ten at night , I was at supper with some friends at my house , and one of my servants told me a dumb fortune teller was below , who must speak with me . Having a mind for a little diversion I order 'd her to be brought up , and accordingly the Prisoner appear 'd . When she saw me , she made signs with her fingers that an old servant of mine had robb 'd me of 2 pieces of gold ; I was very much surpriz 'd at an accusation of this sort against a person who had liv 'd with me 20 years , and therefore in the Prisoner 's presence I went to my closet where I had 11 five guinea pieces . I took out the drawer , and she came behind me , put her hand into the drawer , and before I could stop her , took out a handful . After this she toss 'd them into a lady 's lap , then upon the table , and afterwards into a little girl 's pocket . She then began to speak , and accused my servant again , and I was going to send to a Justice of the peace that moment , but the Prisoner told me my servant had got a false key and robb 'd me while I was asleep , and if I would be patient , she would come next morning at 9 clock , and bring the man who made the false key with her , and he would discover all . With some impatience I waited the Prisoner 's coming next morning , and my servant was in great trouble at being accus 'd in this manner , but the Prisoner not coming according to her promise I suspected her , and on looking over my money I miss 'd the 3 five guinea pieces mentioned in the indictment . Upon this I sent a servant of mine with other people in search after the Prisoner , and offer 'd a guinea reward to any person that should bring her to justice . On the monday following I heard that the Prisoner had bought a pair of shoes and changed a Queen Ann 's 5 guinea piece at Kensington , and after that , by some other intelligence that my servants got , the Prisoner was taken in Drury Lane . This is the 5 guinea piece which the Prisoner changed , and I am positive it is mine . Prisoner . He gave me a supper , wine , punch and money , and why did he not search me before I left his house ? Mr. Maynard . I had no suspicion of her then . Prisoner . It is very hard that I could take the money before his daughter 's and his house keeper 's face . Robert Lincham . On sunday morning the 12th of July the Prisoner and another woman came to my shop at Kensington to buy a pair of shoes . I sold the Prisoner a pair , and she told me she could not pay me unless I could change her a five guinea piece . This piece she gave me , and I went to Mr . Lock 's with it , and he changed it for me . Tho Tucker . I fetch 'd this piece from Mr . Lock 's the distiller 's on the monday morning . Lincham . I gave the Prisoner the change , and then she said she had saved it at work at a farmer 's at Ealing , and that it was her summer 's work . Isaac Lock . I know nothing of the matter , only that Lincham brought a 5 guinea piece to me and desir 'd me to change it for him , and I believe this to be the same . Margaret Rigley . I live at the Grey-Hound at Hammersmith . The Prisoner came to our house and made signs for a lodging , I ca n't tell what day of the month it was , but it was on a sunday . We gave her a lodging out of charity , and about a fortnight afterward she came again , and then she spoke , and said she wanted to buy a pair of shoes : she desir 'd me to lend her my hat to cover her face for fear she should be seen ; I did so , and went with her to Mr. Lincham 's , where I saw her buy a pair of shoes , and change this 5 guinea piece . Prisoner . Did not I change a guinea the thursday before the gentleman was robb 'd ; and did I not tell you I had five more ? Rigley . She did change a guinea at my landlady 's , and said she had 5 more in her petticoats beside that which she had changed . Prisoner . I brought this piece from Ireland . William Connor . I have known the Prisoner about 6 months . I keep a public house , and she has come and spent 3 d. with me , and I never saw any thing by her but what was very good . She always us 'd to speak when she came to my house . Catharine Connor . I have known her 6 months . She has drank a pot of beer in my house , and always paid for it . Guilty Death . 14.

The Prisoner work 'd for me for 2 years last past , in harvest-time , but finding him loose , on the 27th of June last I turn 'd him away , and on the thursday following , in the night time , my house in the parish of Hampstead was broke open . The next morning I found a very remarkable fork which the Prisoner us 'd to work with in my house , and that gave me a suspicion of him , and the saturday morning following I went in pursuit of him . I rode up and down the country a great while to no purpose , and as I was returning home at sunset , I spy 'd the Prisoner about a gunshot from me . I immediately rode up to him , and laid hold of him : He ask 'd me what was the matter ; and I told him he knew what he had done , and I would hang him . After this I took him down to my house , where he was search 'd by two of my servants , and my spurs , watch , and 43 s. in money were found upon him . He then confess 'd that about 12 o'clock at night he cut the bar of my brewhouse window with this knife , then took out a pane of glass , and got in at the window , and after that open 'd the brewhouse door , and went into the kitchen which is adjoining . When he got into the kitchen , he took out a small bureau , which he carried a field or two , and then broke to pieces , and rifled of 44 s. which I had put into it but a few hours before . He told me , when he had done this , he broke open a closet in the kitchen , and took out a pair of silver spurs , and a pair of black mourning buckles ; after which he broke open a corner cupboard , from whence he took my watch . When I miss 'd my bureau , I order 'd two of my servants to look up and down the grounds for it , and we found it in the second field from my house , broke all to pieces , and the papers that were in it flying about . Richard Haly , junior . After the Prisoner was in custody , I heard him say , that when he entered the house he heard our clock strike twelve , and the first thing he took out was the small bureau , which he carried a field or two and then rifled . That he came in again and broke open the closet and the corner cupboard ; but I did not hear him mention what he took from thence . Richard Porter . I was servant to Mr. Haly at this time . We had been brewing , and I had been fetching some grains , and saw the brewhouse quite safe over night , and the next morning the window was cut through , and a pane of glass taken out . I saw the silver watch and spurs taken from him , and heard him own the fact , and he said it was about 12 o'clock when he got into the house . Prisoner . I have nothing to say for myself , but must refer myself to the mercy of the court . Guilty Death . 21.

The counsel for the king having opened the indictment , and the nature of the evidence , the witnesses were called . Robert Stimpson . I was boatswain of the ship Samuel and Rebecca , and the Prisoner was chief mate . Counsel . How long have you known the prisoner ? Stimpson . I had known him about a year and half before this happen 'd ; I was on board with him , and the ship was just come from Norway to this port of London , laden with deals . Counsel . Do you remember Edward Stone ? Stimpson . Yes , he was a custom-house officer , and was put on board us at Gravesend , and came up with the ship to Hanover Hole , where we cast anchor . Counsel . How long had the ship been here before he went on shore ? Stimpson . It might be about 5 or 6 days , and I heard that he was very sick with drinking some flip when he went on shore . Counsel . Do you know any thing of the making this slip ? Stimpson . Yes , Sir , I made it my self by the Prisoner 's directions . Counsel . Can you remember what you put into it ? Stimpson . There was beer , sugar , and brandy , and he told me what I must put into it was the same as limons . Counsel . Why did you put any thing else into it ? Stimpson .

Were any of the persons that you saw drink of it quite well afterwards ? Stimpson . There was the maid on board the ship ask 'd me to let her drink of it , and I never heard her complain . Q . How long had the liquor in the phial been put into it when she drank ? Stimpson . About a minute or two , and I had not stirr 'd it . Counsel . How came you to know that the stuff in this phial was laudanum ? Stimpson . I never heard that it was ; but to be sure it was something of detriment . I told the Prisoner when I was in Yarmouth goal , that it was something more than ordinary ; and he said that Alexander , one of the foremast men , went on shore for it and gave it him , and he told me I need not give my information so strong . He said it was a sleeping dose , since I have been in Newgate . Counsel . Do you think if this flip had been made in the usual manner it would have had this effect ? Stimpson . No , Sir . Counsel . How came you to get to Yarmouth immediately after the death of Stone ? Stimpson . Mr. Foster the surveyor came on board and examined me in the cabbin about this ; and when I came out of the cabbin , the Prisoner bid me go on shore , or else I should come into trouble ; and when I came on shore I saw Stone on the half deck by the main shrouds vomiting , but I ca n't tell whether he drank of the flip or not . Counsel . How long after the people had been drinking this liquor , did you see Stone ? Stimpson . About 3 hours and a quarter : He was then awake , and was walking sore and ast on the deck . Counsel . Had you any discourse with the Prisoner after Stone died ? Stimpson . He told me an officer was dead , and that it was reported that capt . Cox 's people had been the occasion of his death ; and so by his persuasion I went down to Yarmouth . Thomas Davy . I and the deceased were officers of the customs on board this ship . On saturday between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon , Banks alias Vanderbank , a one-eyed man , brought the cann of flip down and recommended it to John Ross one of the King 's watermen , and he drank of it . Counsel . Did Banks drink of it himself ? Davy . I saw him put the cann to his mouth , and he said , Mr. Ross my service to you ; but he did not seem to have his lips wet . Counsel . Was there any complaint of an ill taste that it had ? Davy . Yes , it had an ill taste and an ill smell too . Counsel . What sort of a taste had it ? Davy . A sort of a spicey taste . I drank about a coffee cup full , and it work 'd upon me as if my dinner did not fit well , and I call 'd for some small beer ; that made me vomit , and I continued drinking and vomiting 'till 10 o'clock at night . Counsel . If this liquor had been honestly made do you think it would have troubled you ? Davy . No , if it had not been intoxicated with any thing . Counsel . How long did you st ay on board ? Davy . ' Till Mr . Foster came , and then we found the brandy which was conceal 'd in half anchors . Q . Can you say that Stone drank any ? Davy . No ; but after the people in the hold had drank of it , it was sent up to him on deck . Martha Chandler . I drank of this flip before the brandy was put in , and it did me no hurt at all . Q . Did you know this Stone ? Chandler . Yes , very well , and I saw him drink of it , but I ca n't tell what quantity . Q . Who brought it to him ? Chandler . I ca n't tell . The officers and all the ships crew were together in the hold . Q . Who drank besides Stone ? Chandler . Stimpson and Banks . One Gardiner who was cook of the ship told me he drank a pint and half of it , and he was very sick after it , for ( he said ) he drank the bottom of it , and stirr 'd it up with his knife . No other evidence being offer 'd to support the charge , the Prisoner was acquitted . 22.

Catharine Horrobin was indicted for stealing a silver pint tankard , val . 3 l. 12 s. the goods of Hugh Jones in his dwelling house ; July 20 . It appearing that the Prosecutor was robb 'd of a silver mug , and not of a tankard , as mentioned in the indictment , the Prisoner was acquitted . 24 . 25. Mary Harris alias Murphey and Arthur Murphey of St. George the martyr , were indicted for assaulting Hester Parker in a certain field and open place near the King 's highway , putting her in fear , and taking from her a linen frock , val . 2 s. a linen cap , val . 4 d. and two topknots , val . 1 d. the goods of the said Hester Parker ; July the 25th . At the Prisoner 's desire the witnesses were examin 'd apart . Hester Parker was call 'd , and being examin 'd as to her knowledge of the nature of an oath , and giving satisfactory answers , was sworn and gave the following evidence . One day , about 5 o'clock in the afternoon , three weeks ago , I saw the Prisoner Harris in Lamb 's Conduit-fields . She was going to take me up , and I said she did not know my mamma : I told her she did not know my mamma , and then she took me up in her arms , and said she would rip me up with a penknife if I offer 'd to cry . Q . What was done to you when she took you up in her arms ? Parker . She put the knife pretty near my stomach , and said she would rip me up if I offer 'd to cry , and then she set me down again . After she had done she put me by a ditch side and ask 'd me if I would have a plumb bunn or a plain bunn , and I told her I would have a plain bunn , and while she was gone to fetch it , a gentleman came and lifted me off the ditch , and two little girls went home with me . Q . Do you remember any thing of the man ? Parker . I should not know the man so well as the woman . Q . Did you lose any thing ? Parker . Yes , sir , a frock , a cap and a knot . The woman pull 'd off my frock , and the man took out the pins . Q . When was this done to you ? Parker . It was done in the field , before they set me on the bank . Q . Was the man present when the woman first took you up ? Parker . Yes , sir . Q . Was your frock taken from you before the woman threaten 'd to rip you up ? Parker . Yes ; I cried after my frock was pull 'd off , and she threaten 'd to rip me up . Q . Look at the Prisoner ; are you sure she is the woman ? Parker . Yes , I am very sure of it . Pris . Murphey . Does she know that I was present when the woman first took her up in the street ? Parker . No , not at first . Pris . Harris . Do you know me , my dear ? Parker . Yes , I know you very well . Arthur Parker . When I came home at 8 o'clock in the evening , the child told me she had been robb 'd , and describ 'd the persons . She was very positive to the woman , and could swear to her dress , but as to the man she did not know him so well . The girl said the woman was very much disfigur 'd with the small-pox ; and had on old black shoes , and a blue worsted gown , which very gown she wore when she was taken . As to the man , she described him to be the person that was lying behind the ditch with a handkerchief about his head , while she was sitting among the women in the fields , but she could not recollect his face . The next day , being tuesday , I went to several twopenny lodgings to enquire for the Prisoner , and spent that day to no purpose ; upon which I ask 'd the child if she cou 'd recollect any of the streets the Prisoner had carried her through , for the Prisoner pick 'd her up in Bond 's stables , crying for the missing of us ; and the Prisoner telling her she knew us , and would carry her to Pancras where we were , the child very gladly embrac 'd that opportunity to come to us . When I ask 'd the child if she could tell which way she went , she recollected Gray 's Inn Lane ; upon which I carried her up Chancery Lane , and she remember 'd the green trees there . I then carried her through Gray 's Inn , she did not know that , but as soon as we came into Gray 's Inn Lane , she remember 'd being led through it by the Prisoner . At the upper end of Gray 's Inn Lane , there is a turning goes to Sadler 's Wells ; I took her that way and she did not know it , but she said , Daddy ! there is the sign of the Bottle , glass and bunn , and if she could see that she should know the way . She soon discover 'd the bottle , glass and bunn ; and said there was a gateway somewhere thereabout through which the Prisoner carried her . When she came to the end of the road she was at a stand , and at last shew 'd me the gate and a dunghill , and she told me she remember 'd them very well . After the child had shew 'd me the place where she was robb 'd , I went in pursuit of the Prisoners to the Castle alehouse in Bloomsbury , and enquir 'd of the drawer , who gave me the same description of the woman 's clothes , as the child had done . I was unsuccessful that day , and could not hear of the Prisoners , but I afterwards got a warrant , and gave it to the landlord of the Castle to execute , and I had not sate above an hour in the house before the Prisoner Harris came in , and the child scream 'd out as soon as she saw her . We made her pull off her hat , and the child 's cap and topknot were found upon her . Upon this she was carried before Mr. De Veil , and being ask 'd how she came by the cap and topknot , at first she stammer 'd a little and said she bought them in Monmouth-street , but could not tell of whom , so she was committed for further examination . This was on the thursday , and on the tuesday following , I took the Prisoner Murphey on his master 's shopboard , and I expected he would put on the same cloaths he usually wore , but instead of that he took a coat from a bundle of cloaths that were pil 'd up for sale . I then took him to the Justices , and at first he strenuously denied being in the fields that day ; but at last he own 'd that he was drunk , and that having lost his hat and wig , he slept in the ditch with a handkerchief about his head . Pris . Murphey . Does he not take us up for the sake of the reward ? Mr. Parker . No , by no means , for I did not know there was any reward 'till some time afterwards . Ann Hart . On the 22d of July , I saw a child of this size come up to the side of the bank where the Prisoner was sitting . I believe it might be about 4 o'clock in the afternoon . The child enquir 'd the way to some place - I ca n't tell what place it was , but I found it was where her father and mother were . The Prisoner Harris ask 'd her several questions , and seem 'd very willing to conduct her , and accordingly led her away . Pris . Harris . Are you sure I am the woman ? Hart . Yes , I am sure of it . The Prisoner Murphey was lying asleep on a bank at the side of the ditch at the same time . I am sure it was he , for he desir 'd me to take care of his hat and wig , and I tied the handkerchief about his head . He was pretty much in liquor , and when the Prisoner and the child went away he slept on for a little while , and then he got into the ditch and went away , but which way he went I ca n't tell . Elizabeth Baily . I sell gingerbread by Powis 's wells . The Prisoner desired me to go to the Castle in Bloomsbury to desire her husband , the other Prisoner , to come to her in the fields . I went into Holborn , and in my way I met him , and when I came back again Mrs Hart told me that the Prisoner Harris was gone away with a child . The Prisoner Murphey presently came up , and laid himself down on the bank with a dirty handkerchief about his head , and after he had slept some time , he got up and went away down the field , and afterwards that same night I saw both the Prisoners together in Southampton Row . Pris . Murphey . Did you not meet me in Holborn about the hour that the child was robb 'd ? Hart . I did meet him in Holborn , but I ca n't tell as to the hour . I was at the Justices when he was examin 'd , and he said he was very much fuddled , and own 'd he was in the fields ; but he afterwards contradicted himself and said he was not . Catharine Parker . I took my child 's cap off the Prisoner 's head at the Castle alehouse in Bloomsbury . I am very sure it is mine , for there was a hole in the corner which the child tore by turning her head aside while I was putting it on . There was a wash 'd topknot on it , and it is common for people to cut the ends of ribbon to prevent fraying , I never do cut them , and this which I took upon the Prisoner was not cut , and therefore I take it to be mine . John Birt . Mr. De Veil 's warrant was brought to me to take the Prisoner Harris , and in about half an hour she came by my door . I took her into the house , and the mother of the child took this cap and knot from her , and said it was her 's . I ask 'd the Prisoner about it , and she acknowledged to me that they were the child 's , and that she took them off in the fields . Pris . Harris . I was sitting with this woman that sells gingerbread , and the child asking for her father and mother , I led her to the bottom of Red Lion Street , and there a woman said she knew the child and took her away . Pris . Murphey . As for their taking me up , I never went out of the way , I was every day at my work . John Harris . I keep a public house . The Prisoner Murphey has us 'd my house off and on 6 or 7 years , and I never heard that he wrong 'd any body . Eston Pattison . I have known him ever since I can remember , and when my mother kept a public house , he used it , and has been trusted in it drunk and sober , and I do not think he would be guilty of a base action . Edmund Draytonbury . He work 'd for me when he was taken up , and he would get fuddled now and then , but I never knew him in a Prison in my life . Ann Lanson . I have known him 18 years , and I believe he would live 3 days on a chew of tobacco before he would rob any body . He went by the name of mad Murphey , but I believe he never was so mad as to commit a robbery . Tho Stilgo . I have known him about 20 years , and never heard any harm of him . Robert Turner . He is a very honest man as far as I know . Murphey acquitted , Harris guilty . Death . 26.

Edward Wainwright . I live at Paddington . On the 12th of July I lock 'd up my door and went to a neighbour 's house about a quarter of a mile off , where I staid an hour or something better , and when I return 'd I did not find my house in the same condition as I left it , for a quarri of glass in the ground room was taken out , and the casement was open . I miss 'd 4 s. 4 d. in farthings , and a silver spoon , a paper of pin , 2 s. 6 d. in silver , half a 6 d. broke in two , 2 cap - I ca n't tell whether they were linen or holland , and a pair of stockings . The Prisoner took them away when she got into the house . Q . What reason have you to believe so ? Wainwright . She must have some liberty to take them , or how could it be ? This man took her as she was coming out of the window , and she own 'd it all to him Isabella Wainwright . I keep a chandler 's shop . I and my husband went out , and I fasten 'd and barr 'd up the house my self , and the window was hasp 'd very strong , and was very hard to be got open . There was no glass broke about the place when we went out , and when we came home , the window was broke and the casement was open . The Prisoner was then at my next door neighbour 's , and I ask 'd her why she did so , and she said she did break open the place to take my goods away . Robert Jones . I saw the Prisoner at Mr. Price 's , and heard her say she should have gone further if she had not been interrupted by the man of the house . John Aldridge . On sunday the 12th of July , between 4 and 5 in the afternoon , William Harris Clark call 'd out at the Prosecutor 's garret window , to one Saunders and I , that his landlord and landlady were gone out , had lock 'd the door , and that somebody was robbing the house . We went to the fore window and look 'd in and saw no body : then we went to the back window which look 'd into the shop , and saw the shutter which encloses the shop , broken , and the drawer a little way out ; and we perceived the Prisoner 's legs half way out of the window , getting out . We immediately seiz 'd her , and her pocket being over fill 'd , I saw a pair of purple stockings and a cap in it .

Do you mean that man in the red waistcoat ? Gumley . I really ca n't say whether I do or no . A man may be very much alter 'd ; but I ca n't say I see him here . Prisoner . What did you hear Lowther say ? Gumley . Lowther us 'd to visit Peg Casey in the Marshalsea , and among other things I heard him say , he was concern 'd but for one thing , and that was for swearing against Flack , for he was not guilty of the robbery , but I did not hear him name any particular robbery . Mary Dawson . I never saw the Prisoner before yesterday , but I happen 'd last thursday to go to Clerkenwell Bridewell to see a friend that was there , and I heard Lowther say , that Flack was not the man that was any way concern 'd with him , but he would hang him for the sake of the reward .

John Lowther . On the 29th of March between 8 and 9 at night , Lupton , Flack , and I went out to see what we could get . Flack carried us to Mr. Wheeler 's house in Denmark-Court , and said it was a brave chance if we could but nail it . The Prisoner pull 'd open the winder-shutters , and somebody coming by , we were obliged to keep at a distance for a little while till they were gone , and then I push 'd up the sash window , and endeavour 'd to take down the blinds , but I not being able to do it , Flack said he would get in , or the Devil should have it , and accordingly he unbolted the blind and put it on 2 bureau , and he brought out a silver pint pot , a silver quart cup , a pepper box and a punch ladle , and put them into my lap .

How came you to take the Prisoner ? Davenport . I heard by divers people that he was a robber , and I desir 'd Johnson to assist me ; besides one Thomas Allen told me there was a reward of 40 l. for taking him . Mr. Poulson . The Prisoner was brought before me . I told him I had several information against him for felonies and burglaries , and that Lowther was the evidence against him , and that I would send for him that he might see him face to face . Upon this the Prisoner said he had been concern 'd with Lowther in several felonies ; but if he transported him he could not hang him . Johnson .

They inform 'd me that they sold nothing but China ale ; however I went up stairs , and had 2 or 3 quarterns of liquor . There were some women follow 'd me up stairs ; Davis the Prisoner was one of them , and after we had drank our liquor , I agreed to go to bed with her , and one Martin Heath who was with me made a bargain with another creature , and we paid 6 d. a piece for our beds . I fasten 'd the door of my room and we had not been in bed 6 minutes before the Prisoner Ross came up , and a man like a Chimney-sweeper or coal-heaver with him . He beat against the door in a strange manner , and swore he would kill me if I did not get up . I thought it very hard as I had paid for a bed not to be suffer 'd to sleep in it , so I put the bed stead against the door to keep them out . I had a sword by me and I drew it , thinking to kill two or three of them , but then considering with myself that I was in a strange place , I thought it best to let them alone ; so I put my sword up , and they broke in upon me . Then the Prisoner Davis took my breeches from under the bolster , and carried them out of the room , but whether she carried them down stairs or not , I ca n't tell . I then was in care for my breeches , not knowing how to get home , and presently Davis came in and said the creature that was in bed with me had taken my breeches and rifled them ; and if I would search about the bed-clothes I should find them . Then she pretended to tumble the clothes about , and I saw her put them down on the bed , and when I search 'd my pockets I found only 2 d. in them , for my gold and silver was gone . Q . Did the Prisoner Ross do any thing to you ? Alcock . Yes , he stood over me with a stick as thick as my wrist while she took the breeches . Davis . Did not you bring in Frances Provert with you , and did you not say you had been married to her 4 years and an half ? Alcock . I do n't know but I might say so . Ross . When I came up stairs to bed , did I offer to strike you in any shape ? Alcock . They came up swearing , and said they would kill me . Frances Provert . I met the Prosecutor by chance , and went with him to this house , and when we were a-bed , Ross came up , and a woman took the breeches from the bolster , but I ca n't say that it was the Prisoner Davis . Q . Where was Ross when the woman took the breeches away ? Provert . He was standing over the Prosecutor with a stick . The Prosecutor had his breeches again , for they were laid at the feet of the bed by the same woman that took them away . Winifred Rawlins . I was with Martin Heath at this house , and heard the Prosecutor cry out he should be murder 'd . His breeches were brought down stairs , and I took the money out of them , and it was disbursted , for Ross had it all . There was a guinea , a half crown , and two shillings , and Ross had it all but one crown which he gave me . I ca n't tell who brought the breeches down stairs , for when I and Heath were with Alcock in the room up stairs , Davis was not there . Both acquitted . 52.

I had that day received 28 l. and a crown for my master , and I am positive I had it safe , for before I went to bed I lock 'd it up in a closet in my room , and put the key into my pocket . The Prisoner did not go to bed with me , and I being over-charg 'd with liquor fell asleep presently , and when I 'wak 'd my money was gone and she too .

On the saturday following we took Haines , and she confess 'd that she knew Tailor very well , that he had been with her before , and that she robb 'd him of 21 guineas and a 36 s. piece .

I was in search of the Prisoners , and came into the house just as Gibbs was paying the ten guineas . I took charge of her and the woman who kept the house , and she ( Gibbs ) said she knew nothing of the robbery , but that she had the money from the Prisoner Haines . I afterwards took Haines at Clerkenwell , and she confess 'd to me that she pick 'd Tailor 's pocket of his money while he was asleep at a house in Thatch 'd Alley , Chick-lane .
