I keep an old clothes shop in Monmouth street ; the prisoner and another young woman came to my house to buy a pair of stays , and bought a pair , and gave me eleven shillings for them ; she came again , and said , they did not sit , and asked me if I would change them ; I said , yes , with all my heart : she had a bundle , which she said was the lining of a gown , and desired leave to tie it up upon the counter ; I saw a little bit of a pair of stays ; and said , young woman , you seem as if you had got a pair of stays there ; she said , so she had ; I desired to look at them , she let me see them , and then I knew them to be mine , and I took them from her .

Thomas Creed . I keep a publick house at the Bell and Magpye without Bishopsgate . I came home the evening the mug was lost , about ten minutes before ten o'clock : when I came to the door , I saw one free of my house shut up , the door was bolted , and my maid was charging the prisoners with conveying the mug away , and they denied they knew any thing of it .

The prisoners came into my master 's house , and called for a pint of beer ; I filled it for them , and put it upon the table . Q . What time was that ? Kyte . It was between seven and eight . I went round the house to count the tankards and mugs ; when I came to the table where the prisoners sat , I missed the man in the blue coat [ Collyer ] and the mug ( my master has seven silver tankards , and six mugs . ) Q . Had the prisoners the silver mug to drink out of ? Kyte . They had a pewter pot first , but Collyer gave me the silver mug afterwards to draw the beer in . Collyer went out , and came in again presently , and then I charged him with taking the mug , and charged a constable with him directly . Prisoner Farmer . The young woman told me she set the mug down before me , and it was other people that had the mug . Kyte . I set the mug down before you . Farmer . Did I ever go out of the house or offer to go out of the house ? Kyte . I do n't know that you did ; the pewter pot stood down by you , and the beer was poured out of the silver mug into the pewter pot . Joseph Kennell . I went it into the house just before the prisoner came in , and had a pint of ale in a silver mug ; they had a pint of beer in a pewter pot . Collyer came in with something in a dirty cloth ; and they said , what have you got there ? he said , a fillet of veal , what , said they , in that dirty bag ? Upon that he threw it out , and there was two or three trowels of mortar in it , which he threw behind the chimney , and said , he would make a cross bunn of it . I went away soon after , and the maid said , the minute I was gone they gave her the mug to fill . I went from Mr. Creed 's to the Founders arms in Founders court , and was sent for back again directly . I was not twenty minutes out of the house before I came back again . Charles Pollard . I live down the One Swan yard . I found the mug the 13th of this month , in the yard , close up by the side of a wheel spur covered with mud . Q . Had it a name upon it ? Pollard . I did not know it had , till the people said , they would be hanged if it was not Mr. Creed 's mug , and they looked , and there was his name round the bottom of it . Prisoner Collyer . I bid the maid not to frighten herself about the mug , for I would not go out of the house till she was satisfied , and I staid till the constable came , which was eleven o'clock ; it was about ten o'clock when the watchmen came down , and I said , Mr. Creed , I will not make any resistance , for I am innocents and we went with the watchmen to the watch-house , and from the watch-house to the Counter without any constable . Q . Did you see the mug after Kennell was gone ? Kyte . Yes , and Collyer presently afterwards gave me the mug to fill . Ann Lucas .

I have known him twelve years , and he always was reckoned a hard working , honest man . Creed . This witness , Mr. Lucas , came to my house last Saturday , and because I would not take bail , he said , I should not keep the Bell and Magpye next week . Acquitted . 264.

She persuaded me to go from my mother , and go along with them ; and because I would not go with them to smother the old gentlewoman - Q . What do you mean by smother ? Bibby .

I found this Bibby there , and beat her , and broke my horse-whip to pieces upon her , though I had no concern with her . Sarah Moore . This Bibby came several times to the goal , swore and cursed , and said she would put her into the information ; and the Prisoner said if you do , you will put me in wrongfully ; and Bibby said , I cast five last sessions , and I will cast you for your life this sessions , and put some clothes on my back .

On the 15th instant I was informed that Thomas Spike the Prisoner , who was then my servant , was taken up for a robbery , and I found that he had taken this watch from me . It is not my watch , it is the property of Mr . Friend , though it was in my possession . I very little suspected him , because he always behaved himself handsomly and well . Nathaniel Brown . On the 15th of May my servant called me , and I was told the Prisoner had brought a gold watch to pawn . I asked him whether it was his own ; he said it was . I asked him whose servant he was ; he said he was my Lord Bollingbroke 's servant ; I said , I believed my Lord was not in town . I asked him how he came by it ; he said , his brother gave it him . I asked him where his brother lived ; he said , he lived with a gentleman whose name I have forgot . I said , you say your brother is a servant to a gentleman , it is very odd that he should give you a gold watch : he shall said that his brother gave it him . I said , if he did not give a better account of it , I must stop him . He said , what ! do you think I stole it ? I told him , to be plain with him , I did believe he had stolen it . I had him before a Magistrate , and there he said he was not my Lord Bollingbroke 's servant , but Mr. Master 's servant . Q . Where was the watch ? Masters . It was in an open drawer , but I had not seen it for some months . The Prisoner is a downright country boy , and I believe it is the first fact that ever he was guilty of . Guilty .

She lives in the neighbourhood overagainst me , and I never knew any harm of her . This is the gown I lent money on . Carpenter . This is my child 's gown . Q. to the Prisoners . How came you by the gown ? Prisoner Metcalf . The little girl desired us to go and play with her , and this other Prisoner and I stripped the child of her gown , and went to the pawnbroker 's with it . Prisoner Brown [ a girl about fourteen years old . ] We were going along together , and Metcalf pulled the gown off the child . Q. to Dockery . How came you to let such a child as that have money upon goods ? Dockery . Because her mother used to send her with things . John Marrioge ( Constable . ) The child lost the gown on Friday in the afternoon ; I went to Mr. Dockery 's house , and searched his books , and the gown was entered as on Saturday .

Bickley . It was in the night ; they confessed it before the Justice , and that they pawned my handkerchief for six pence , and they told me where the buckles were , but the silversmith would not give any account of them : he said he believed he had bought such a pair , but could give no account of them , and unless the man who brought them came he could do nothing in it . Q . What are you ? Bickley . I am a brewer 's servant . Q . Did you find your handkerchief ? Bickley . Yes ; I found it at a chandler 's shop in King Street . Q . How came you to charge the Prisoners ? Bickley .

What did she say in excuse ? Platt . She said she designed to fetch them back , and she told us where they were pawned : I had two shirts from Mr. Harrison 's . George Crofton . The Prisoner brought these shifts and a handkerchief , & c. to Mr. Harrison 's , and pawned them . Q . Did she say they were her own ? Crofton . I did not ask her any questions , for my master has known her a great while , and he never knew her do such a thing before . Edward Herbert produced several things the Prisoner had pawned to him , the property of the Prosecutor 's . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 271.

Sarah Brown . Between six and seven o'clock the Prisoner came in and wanted some anniseed , I told him we did not sell any ; then he said he would have some gin , and he had a half peny worth , and I gave him a bit of bread .

When I came into the house I was very much fuddled indeed ; there was a man came in , and I heard something chink : there were two or three doors ; and I saw four or five persons running . I saw these things lie upon the ground , and I inadvertently being fuddled took them up , for I verily believe that man laid them down . Guilty .

Signed Thomas Multhoe , Clerk of Assise for the County of Berks . April 21 , 1745. Joseph Barker sworn . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Barker . I knew him in Reading goal , and he was carried to Abingdon the summer assizes in July 1742 , it will be three years next July . I was one of the sheriffs officers , and assisted the keeper of Reading goal to carry the Prisoners to Abingdon . Q . What was he tried for ? Barker . He was tried for robbing Henry Lannoy Hunter , Esq ; of some cocks and hens . Q . How do you know him to be the person ? Barker . I am sure he is the man : I was carrying him and thirteen more who were to be transported , and he got away from me about two miles and an half from Reading , as I was told . Q . Was he confined then ? Barker . He was in irons and handcuffed , but he had cut them off : he carried one of the bazzils along with him . Q . Did any more of them get away ? Barker . No ; I carried thirteen safe . Q . Was it day-light ? Barker . It was not quite day-light . Q . Where was you then ? Barker . I was on horseback on the right hand side of the waggon , there was another person on the other side of the waggon , and three or four persons with them in the waggon . Q . When did you miss him ? Barker . I did not miss him till day-light , and found his irons in the waggon . Q . Where did you find him again ? Barker . I found him in the Poultry Counter , and he threatened our lives then . Q . Who told you of his being there ? Barker . The goal keeper was informed of it . Q . Have you seen him at large since his conviction ? Barker . I never saw him at large since . Prisoner . Did not you go to school along with me ? Barker . It is so long since that I can not very well remember it , I know nothing more of the gentleman . Francis Haslet . I know the Prisoner is the person who stole the hens from 'Squire Hunter : I gave evidence against him at Abingdon . Q . Are you sure he is the person ? Haslet . I am certain and sure he is the man . Edward Holloway . I am Mr. Wiseman 's turnkey at Reading goal ; I was at the bringing the Prisoner up to London with a design to have him on board merchant Forward 's ship . He cut off his irons as the other Prisoners told me , and they said he jumped out of the waggon in Maidenhead Thicket between one and two in the morning . Prisoner . I think it is a very hard thing for a man to swear to another person 's voice , as he says he will swear to mine . Holloway . Yes ; I could swear to it your voice is so remarkable , for I have known you fifteen or sixteen years : you have threatened my life a great many times , John . Lancelot Howlet . I am a watchman of Portsoken Ward . On the 18th of March the Prisoner abused our watchman ; there was a warrant served on him the same day for assaulting and abusing them , and I was at the taking him . He wounded some of the watchmen in Gravel Lane , and they got a warrant for him that day as soon as they had an opportunity . Q . Was there a riot in the night , and an abuse of the watch ? Howlet . Yes ; and we went to assist the Constable . Q . Did you know the Prisoner before ? Howlet . The Prisoner lived in Patrick 's Court in Hounsditch with a common sort of a creature . Q . What creature ? Howlet . Why , a whore or a harlot , or whatever you please to call it . There was a quarrel at an alehouse in Gravel Lane , and I heard that the Prisoner had got away , but the people said there was a watchman very much hurt , and that the Warder had been knocked down and very much abused ; so as soon as possible Mr. Day the Beadle got a warrant and went to his lodging , and my partner and I went with him , and we went in with a design to knock him down for fear of his doing us a mischief : I catched the Prisoner by the collar , and he offered , as I thought , to put his hand in his pocket , and presently he gave a chop , and I was cut , but I do not know what he did it with . Q . Was it the Prisoner that cut you ? Howlet . I saw nobody but the Prisoner and my partner , and I hope your Lordship do n't think the watchmen would cut one another . The Prisoner got away from us , but going up the steps by Devonshire Squire we took him again . Q . What is your partner 's name ? Howlet . Jack Lee , or John Lee . Q . Would you ask Howlet any questions ? Simmons . As to asking that man any questions , I believe he will say any thing , and I will not give the Court any trouble . I hope the honourable Court will take notice of what that man says without my exposing him ; he says I cut him , and I had nothing to cut him with . Howlet . I had hold of his left fist , and with his right hand he made a chop at me , and I received a cut at that time . Q . Where was you cut ? Howlet . I was cut upon my wrist , and through the wristband of my shirt ; I could shew you , but I have not the same shirt on now . Simmons . What did I cut you with ? Howlet . I said before I could not tell what you cut me with . Q . Had he any instrument about him ? Howlet . He got from us , and run away ; and he might throw that away as he run along . There was none found upon him . John Lee [ a watchman . ] I took the Prisoner in Patrick 's court in Houndsditch the same day , [ for this mischief was done between twelve and one in the morning ] Mr. Day the beadle got a warrant to take the prisoner up . My partner and I went at night along with Mr. Day , in order to take him in his lodging ; and with a design to knock him down if he made any resistance ; and accordingly we told him , if he offered to put his hand into his pocket , we would knock him down : he put his hand in his pocket , and struck at me with a knife ; I struck at him , but missed him ; I struck at him again , and he fell a reeling [ this was in the alley by the Prisoner 's house ] My Partner Howlet got hold of him , and they were both upon the ground : my partner said , do n't strike , for am I uppermost ; and there was another watchman [ Robert Robinson ] who was cut in the hat . I felt about his clothes , but he had nothing about him when he was taken . * The Beadle , Constable , and Watchman , all went in the dark to take him upon a surprize ; for they know he was such a desperate fellow , it would be very difficult to take him . Prisoner . Pray ask this gentleman what they first charged me with ? Lee . Why , for cutting and abusing the watchmen ; and cutting that watchman 's [ Bentley ] hand almost off . John Bentley . I was called out of the watch-house about twelve o'clock or between twelve and one . Q . What day of the month was that ? Bentley . It was the 18th of March between twelve and one in the morning ; I was informed there was a quarrel in the alehouse ; I went there , and they charged me with the Prisoner at the bar . He gave me good words , and said , he would stay till the constable came ; but all on a sudden he got from me , and cut me cross the head with a knife ; then he gave me a cut cross my wrist , and cut the leaders of my arm , and I am afraid I shall never have the use of it again . Q . Was he in any body 's custody before ? Bentley . No , he was quite at liberty . Prisoner . I do n't know the man . Bentley . I ought to know you ; and I believe I shall as long as I live ; you have made me remember you . Richard Baddington . I am warder of the watch-house in Gravel-lane , for Covent-garden precint . There was a woman came to the watch-house , and she said Mr. Simmons had abused her husband at a public house . Q . Did you know Simmons before ? Boddington . Only by his living some time in the neighbourhood . I went along with her , and going along I said to him , how could you be so unkind as to make such a disturbance and a noise at this time o'night ? When I came to the publick house , he wanted to run away , but I took hold of his collar , and he knocked me down ; this was at the alehouse . My watchmen hearing that I was in a fray came to my assistance ; but the prisoner being a stout , lusty fellow ( and , as I suppose , fearing something of danger if he was taken ) knocked me down again , and run away . Prisoner . I have nothing more to say . I submit my self to the honourable court . I know nothing of the matter . Guilty Death . 273 . + Ann Davis , late of the parish of St. Andrew Holborn , London , Spinster , otherwise Ann , the wife of Anderears Boswell , was indicted for stealing , three silk gowns , val . 3 l. one silk petticoat , val . 5 s. one cotton gown , val . 10 s. one pair of jumps , val . 10 s. two cotton caps , val . 2 s. three shirts , val . 12 s. two long lawn aprons , val . 4 s. one pair of silk stockings , val . 2 s. 6 d. one quilted stuff petticoat , val . 5 s. the goods and chattels of Matth.ew Morton , in his dwelling house , May 1st .

I advertised them several times , and on the 13th of this month , Mr. Sherrar , a pawnbroker , came to me , and said , he believed by an advertisement he had seen , he had got some of my things in his custody ; that he knew the woman who brought them , for she had been several times at his shop , and may be she might come again ; and if she came again , he would stop her : and he stopped her with a gown and a pair of stays . The Prisoner said before Sir Thomas De Veil , that her husband 's name was Evans , and that he was a journeyman carver , and lived in Dirty Lane in Holborn ; but I found her habitation to be in Parker 's Lane in Drury Lane : and I found the chints gown , and the black silk gown and petticoat in her lodging , picked to pieces . John Sherrar . The Prisoner at different times brought to me , one gown , three shifts , one apron , an under petticoat , and a pair of jumps . On the 13th of May , I saw these things advertised , and they are very remarkable ; so I went to Mr. Morton 's , and acquainted him with it .

I met an acquaintance of mine , one Mrs. Jones , who lived in Essex , one day as I was going to Clare Market , and she told me , her aunt was dead , and had left her her clothes , and desired to know , if I could recommend her to an honest pawnbroker : I told her I knew a very honest man ; then she desired me to pawn them for her ; I said , I was not willing to do it , she had better pawn them herself ; but as she desired me to do it , I pawned them to Mr. Sherrar , where I used to go , and I would have taken her up to have cleared my self , if I could have found her . She said , she would pull the black gown and petticoat to pieces , to make herself mourning for her aunt . Mr. Blower . Your landlady said , you had picked that black gown to pieces . Prisoner . I told Mr. Sherrar I was very sorry they were stolen , and that the woman I had them from was at the end of the street . Sherrar . She did say the woman she had them of [ Mrs. Jones ] was waiting at the end of the street ; I sent to see , and there was no such person there . Elizabeth Rollison . The Prisoner lodged in my house six or seven months , and she always behaved very well . Q . What business is her husband ? Rollison . Her husband is a carver . Q . What does she do for her living ?

How long ago is it ? Brown . I ca n't tell whether this May is out * . * The Prisoner was tried the last day of May . Q . What May was it ? Brown . It was last May , I think . Q . What day of the month was it ? Brown . It was one day in May , I can not tell what day ; I remember particularly it was on a Wednesday . Q . How do you know it was on a Wednesday ? Brown . I know by my work ; because it was a leisure day , and I generally wash on Thursday . Q . When was you called upon to say this ? Brown . This was about a week ago : When I heard the news I was surprised at it . Q . Are you sure it was on a Wednesday ? Brown . Upon my oath it was on a Wednesday . Prisoner . If I had stole these things , I should hardly carry them to pawn , when they were all marked . Morton . I understand this man [ Boswell ] is not your husband ; for he has another wife . Prisoner . He is my husband , Davis is my maiden name . Thomas Evans . I am a barber and perriwig-maker . Q . Where do you live ? Evans . The last place I lived in , was in Bow-street Covent Garden . Q .

Because they were found upon him . Q . How did you get them again ? Brooks . The Prisoner was apprehended and brought back to my gate , and he took them out of his pockets himself . Sarah Brooks ( daughter of Martha Brooks . ) I looked out of the window , and saw that the gate was shut ; and afterwards I saw it was open : I stole down stairs , missed the china off the tea table , and saw the Prisoner go out of the house , and out of the court yard : I run after him two or three hundred yards , and called out , stop thief ! He was taken and brought back to the house ; I saw him pull some of the china out of his pockets . Prisoner . What clothes had I on ? Sarah Brooks . You had a whitish great coat . Prisoner .

He refused to plead to the name Lucas , and said his name was Ninn . 278 . And Eleanor Young for receiving the same knowing them to be stolen , April 15 . [ At Lucas 's desire the witnesses were examined apart . ] Thomas Chitty . I am a watchmaker , I live in Hand Court in High Holborn . On Good Friday the 12th of April my house was robbed by persons unknown , who entered the house , and took the goods mentioned in the indictment . Q . What time was it ? Chitty . I was in the room out of which the goods were taken at considerably past nine o'clock at night , and I saw that every thing was fast . Q . How do you know what time it was ? Chitty . I have a great deal of regard to time ; I have a clock in the same room . Q . How was the door fastened ? Chitty . I can not tell . Q . What time did you find the door open ? Chitty . It was about three quarters after nine . Q . How did you discover it at first ? Chitty . My wife , and I , and the maid , were in the back parlour , behind the room where the goods were ; the maid looked round her , and said , God bless me , there is something white : my wife and I went into the room , and they proved to be two shirts of mine . Q . How long was that after you saw that every thing was fast ? Chitty . About half an hour . My wife is a mantua maker , and she remembered she had laid five gowns down in the room , she looked for them , and found they were gone , and that we were robbed of a great deal of linen besides : the gowns lay in a parcel behind the door . Q . What did you lose ? Chitty . I lost five gowns ; there were two gowns of one gentlewoman 's , Mrs. Mary Herbert 's , that we are charged five guineas for ; there is a gown which is called six pieces of silk , which I think my wife paid a guinea for ; a tabby gown of her own she valued at two guineas , 18 shirts which I charge at 4 l. 10 s. though they cost 17 s. a shirt : ( there are a great many more things than my wife or I could think of ; ) and at the lowest I could set them at they amounted to 19 l. 10s . or 11s . which is much less than the value of them . Q . What did you see upon your coming into the room ? Chitty . I saw the shirts lying upon the ground ; I found the parlour door open , and the street door open , but the windows were all fast . Q . If you were in the next room while the things were took away , how came you not to hear them ? Chitty . It was a surprizing thing that we should not hear , but whether we were talking louder than ordinary , I can not tell . Q . What partition was there between the room you were in and the other ? Chitty . But a very thin wainscot , and the door was not shut , it was partly open , and I was the more surprized at the robbery upon that account . Q . What sort of a night was it ? Chitty . It was a dark misty night . Q . Do you know any thing of the Prisoners ? Chitty . I do not know any thing of them ; as to Mrs. Young I never saw her till last Saturday was sev'night , when I took her in Long Lane by Smithfield . I had a warrant from Sir Thomas De Veil , and another from Sir Joseph Hankey , and by Bye 's Direction [ the accomplice ] I found part of my things at a house which was said to be Mrs. Lucas 's house , the wife of Lucas the Prisoner at the bar . [ Part of the goods were produced and showed to Mr . Chitty . ] Chitty . Here is a skirt of a coat which has been upon the backs of ten or eleven children , I can swear to it by that , my Lord ; here is a waistcoat of mine , here is one of my stocks , I should know it if I was not to see it for seven years ; there are several other things I know to be mine ; these were taken in Mrs. Lucas 's house . There was a heap of things there of other people 's . Q . What information had you from James Bye ? Chitty . I advertised my goods twice , I think on the Easter Monday and the Thursday following . I offered three guineas reward and no questions asked , which I think ought not to be done , and if it was to do again , I believe I should not do it . About three weeks after that a young man came to my house , and asked if I had not been robbed ; I said , I had ; said he , I believe we have taken some of the persons that did it ; and one James Bye is in Woodstreet Counter , and by this Bye I came by some of my goods . Q . What is the person 's name ? Chitty . I do not know his name [ another person in Court said his name is Tawney . ] Prisoner Lucas . He is a common thieftaker , my Lord . Thomas Tawney . I never took any body in my life . Prisoner Lucas . Were there any marks of violence offered to the door ? Chitty . We found the parlour door and the street door both open . Lucas . Was the lock or the hinges , or any thing broke ? Chitty . There was nothing at all broke . Q . Was the family up or in bed ? Chitty . They were all up , there were none of them in bed . Lucas . What particular things were the goods put in , or where did they lie ? Chitty . Some of the things lay in the room , and the other things were in the bureau ; there are four drawers in the bureau . Q . Where did the bureau stand ? Chitty . It stood just within the parlour door . Jury . Which parlour door do you mean ? Chitty . I mean the door which goes into the passage ; it stands between that door and the window that looks into the street . James Bye . I have known Jeffs about five months . Q . What is he ? Bye . He is a butcher by trade , but he does not follow the business now . Q . What does he follow now ? Bye . I believe he has followed thieving these twelve months . Q . What has he followed since you knew him ? Bye . He has followed nothing but thieving . Q . Do you know Richard Horton ? Bye . Yes - he goes by the name of Toss off Dick . Q . What Business is he ? Bye . He used to follow driving of carts , but for two months he has followed nothing but thieving , though I never was concerned with him but in two robberies in my life , no other than picking of pockets . Q . What is the other Prisoner 's name ? Bye . His name is Lucas , though he came in here by the name of Ninn , because he was tried last assizes at Chelmsford , and he put himself down in that name , because the record should not be brought up against him . Q . Do you know Eleanor Young . Bye . Yes . Q . How long have you known her ? Bye . Ever since Easter Monday . Q . Where does she live ? Bye . She lived then in Moor Lane , but they say she lives now in Long Lane by Smithfield : they said she was Black Smith 's wife [ commonly called Black Sam . ] Q . Who were concerned in this affair of Chitty 's ? Bye . I was concerned , John Jeffs , Richard Horton , otherwise Toss off Dick , and Lucas ; we went from Lucas 's house . Q . What time did you go ? Bye . We went out about eight o'clock , when it was just dusk , and went to Gray 's Inn , then we went into Hand Alley . Q . What did you do there ? Bye . We all four went down to the watchmaker 's . Q . To what watchmaker 's ? Bye . To Mr. Chitty 's ; I did not know he was a watchmaker then ; when we came there Lucas opened the latch of the street door , and went into the entry , and then opened the parlour door . Q . How did that stand ? was it on the right hand or on the left hand ? Bye . As you go in it was on the right hand ; when he had opened the parlour door I went into the house after him , and Toss off Dick and Jeffs stood at the street door waiting for what things we brought out ; Lucas stood at the parlour door and bid me bring in a dark lanthorn , which we had for that purpose . Q . Where was you then ? Bye . I was in the entry , Lucas ordered me to go and light the dark lanthorn . Q . Was it dark ? Bye . It was dark , it was a misty night , and rained a little . Q . What did you do ? Bye . I went to a chandler 's shop and lighted a candle , and brought it out between my fingers , and when I came out I put it into the lanthorn , put the blind before it , and put it under my coat , then I came into the entry and left Jeffs and Toss off Dick at the door ; I gave the lanthorn to Lucas , and he went into the parlour with it , and presently returned with some womens clothes . I went to Horton for the bag , and Lucas took it out of my hand and put it into Jeffs 's hand through a mistake : when he gave these things to Jeffs he ordered him to go and stand at Gray 's Inn Gate ; Lucas went in again and brought out as many things as I could carry away in the slaps of my coat and under my arms , and Toss off Dick took as many as he could carry away in his arms , and Lucas came out and brought as many as he could carry in his coat and breast ; then we went out to speak to Jeffs . I pulled off this coat [ the coat he had on ] and laid it upon the dunghill , and put as many of the goods into it as I could , and Lucas ordered Jeffs to pull off his coat and put the rest of the things into it ; then Lucas ordered Toss off Dick and I to stay at the dunghill till he and Jeffs went to the house again , and they returned with as many things as they could well bring away ; then we took the handkerchiefs off our necks to tie them up in . Q . What sort of goods were they ? Bye . There were a great many shirts and stocks , and I remember this damask cap with a gold button to it in particular . We went a third time to the house , and brought a great many more things away ; then we carried all the goods to Lucas 's house , and we persuaded Toss off Dick to go home , and told him we should not look at the things that night . Q . What did you do with them ? Bye . They were sold to Eleanor Young . Q . Who sold them to Young ? Bye . Lucas did , but they kept some of them for their own use . Q . When was this ? Bye . This was on Easter Monday ; we went for one Ann Collier * to come and look at them , and she would give us no more than 40s . so we would not let her have them : Toss off Dick came next day , and said , that Eleanor Young would give no more than two guineas for them . * She was tried last December Sessions for Assaulting Alexander Forfar , a Headborough of St. James 's Clerkenwell , on the highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a silk handkerchief , a powder born , and a pistol .

We went down the court to see what we could get , and tried at several latches in the court , but none of them would open but that . Q . How do you know this was Chitty 's house ? Bye . It was over against the tavern ; for the next day we went down the court to hear what rumours there were about the robbery , and we found it was over against the Vine Tavern . Chitty . It is within one door of being over against the Vine Tavern ; they might easily know that , for my name is wrote in capital letters . Prisoner Jeffs . Had I any of the goods or money ? Bye .

There was nobody but my master , and mistress , and If we were at supper . Q . Now give an account of what happened ? Rose .

Q . What time was that ? Rose . I believe it was about twenty minutes after nine . Q . Was the door between the sore parlour and the back parlour close ? Rose . It was not quite close . Q .

I am a headborough of St. Luke 's parish ; these goods were found in a house in Blue Anchor Alley .

Q . Were they found in Lucas 's house ? Lowe . The people said that Lucas lived there . Q . Was there any body in the house then ? Lowe . Nobody at all ; they had all left the house .

He is telling the story upon what account we were taken up at first . Q . What happened after that ? Tawney . John Jeffs , one Martin , and this Bye , cut and mangled me in the street in a desperate manner . I took Jeffs up upon the account of mangling me , and that brought all this to light . Q . Why did they cut you ? Tawney . There were two or three words passed between us , and Jeffs cut me upon the shoulder , and then stabbed me into the shoulder ; so I took Jeffs up , Jack Martin , and John Bye . Q . Where is Martin ? Tawney . He is in the Counter ; he is an evidence , but not upon this robbery . When Bye was taken up he desired to go before a Magistrate , for he said he could do something that would be for the good of his country , and desired to be admitted an evidence ; and he said I can take two as I go along . I was with the Prisoners at Lucas 's house in a Court in Blue Anchor Alley . Q . How did you know that this was Lucas 's house ? Tawney . Bye gave me information of it , and I was there with Mr. Chitty : Mr. Chitty found several things there that were his ; and all the things were packed up and carried to the Constable 's house .

Lucas had the whole house , and I lodged in one of the rooms . Ann Sparrow . I was going along with Mr. Tawney , and saw this Jeffs and one Martin together , ( for I never saw Lucas or Horton before ) and Jeffs said to Mr. Tawney , D - n your eyes , what do you flag at ? and then Jeffs said to Martin , D - n your eyes , kiddy slash away . Mr. Tawney was cut , and I borrowed a hanger to lend a person who went to take them , for they were afraid to go unguarded . Q. to Bye . Do you know any thing of Tawney 's bing cut ? Bye . Yes ; he was cut . Q . Did Jeffs cut him ? Bye . I can not say that Jeffs cut him , but Martin did . Q . Who were in company with you ? Bye . Jeffs , Martin , and I were in company .

Has she a good character in the neighbourhood ? Smith . Yes , she has , for I can not say she is a thief . Bye . This woman desired me to be as favourable as I could to Eleanor Young . Smith . I said to him , young man , how came you to put her into your information ; did you ever see her before ? and he said he never did ; and I told him then he was a forsworn villain . Prisoner Lucas . I desire your Lordship will give me leave to speak in my own defence . The evidence does not do this for the good of his country , only for the sake of the reward . Prisoner Horton . Bye said he would put me into his information only for the sake of the reward , because I have nobody to appear for me . Jeffs , Horton , and Lucas , guilty , Death . Eleanor Young acquitted .

George Thorne . On the 25th of April last , about a quarter before ten at night , I was going by the New Market , and enquired for Shoe Lane : I asked those two gentlewomen the way , and they said , they would shew me the way : they took me down a passage , which , as I have been informed since , was George Alley ; when they came about the middle of the place , one of them said , that is the way to Shoe Lane , and said , Sir , wo n't you give us something to buy a dram ; I put my hand into my pocket , and I had but a penny , which I gave her ; she said , D - n your blood , that is not enough to buy a dram ; I said , I had no more half-pence ; she said , D - n you , you have got money enough , and we will have it before you go . I laid hold of them , with a design to take them to the watch ; I did not think they would rob me . Then a fellow in a white frock very dirty came up with a stick , knocked me up against the wall , and gave me several blows with the stick , I was very ill used by him , and in a very bloody condition . Then Rush came up with a penknife , and said , D - n your blood , if you do n't deliver your money , I 'll cut the ball of your eye out ; then a fellow came up in a blue waistcoat , with a long knife in his hand . Q . Had Greenaway any thing in her hand ? Thorne . No , I did not see any thing ; then they robbed me of 8 s. Q . Who took the money from you ? Thorne . Greenaway took the money , for her hand was in my pocket . Q . Did you lose any thing else ? Thorne . Yes , they took my hat off my head , then Mr. Keys came up , and the man in blue followed him . Q . When was it that the man in blue came up ? Thorne . I was robbed before he came up , but he came up immediately . Q . What did he do ? Thorne . He only held up a knife , and said , D - n you , what are you doing here ? and Greenaway said , it is but seven or eight shillings , and the man in blue said , D - n you , I wish it had been as many pounds . Q . Was you robbed when Mr. Keys came up ? Thorne . Yes , and I told him , one of those women had robbed me ; I had hardly spoke the words before the man in blue came up . I had hold of both the women , and should have kept them , if those fellows had not come up . Q . Had you hold of both the women ? Thorne . Yes , I had hold of them both . Q . You say you was not robbed till the man in the dirty frock came up ? Thorne . No , I was not ; and when he came up , he said , D - n you , what are you doing of ? And Rush said , D - n this country cull , I 'll cut the ball of his eye out , if he do n't deliver his money . Q . How long time was there between the fellow in the dirty frock coming up , and Mr. Keys coming ? Thorne . Mr. Keys came up presently . Q . Was the man in blue come up , when Mr. Keys came ? Thorne . He was not ; but there was not a moment 's difference between their coming . When I told Mr. Keys I was robbed , he said , he was very sorry for it : he went away , and said , he would run to the watch , and acquaint them with it . Q . Did Mr. Keys run away ? Thorne . I believe he was frightened , for there was a desperate fellow that came up to him ? Q . What happened after that ? Thorne . After the Prisoners had robbed me , they went away . I met Mr. Keys coming from the watch-house , and he said , the watchmen told him , they were vile wicked creatures , and I had better come and look after them in another manner . Mr. Keys told me where he lived , and advised me to come , when I was in a better condition , for I was very bloody . Q . When did you take the Prisoners ? Thorne . I took them the 7th or 8th of May . Q . How did you take them ? Thorne . I went into Black Boy Alley , and heard of them ; I went to Mr. Berry , who lives in Chick Lane , and told him , I was robbed by two women , and described them , and he ordered me to go to the Pump ale-house in Chick Lane , and Mr. Berry came to me : he went and shewed me several women ; I fixed upon the two Prisoners , and told him , those were the two women that robbed me : he said , do n't say a word now , for there are a parcel of sad cattle live here , and if you do , there will be murder committed ; but about two o'clock in the morning , the constable and the watch secured them , and Mr. Berry sent to me about eight , to let me know they were taken . Q . How do you know the Prisoners are the women ? Thorne . I took particular notice of them by the lamps , I saw them very distinctly for a considerable time , and I know their voices , and I know them by their gowns . Q . Did you know the Prisoners before that time ? Thorne . I never saw them before the 25th of April . Matthias Keys . On the 25th of April , between nine and ten at night , I was going up the Fleet Market , and in George Alley I saw two women and a man , the man was very bloody , and told me , he had been robbed by those two women ; one of the women had a penknife in her hand ; they were telling some money over , and they took his hat off his head . Q . Did you see them take it off ? Keys . Yes , they took it off his head just before I came up to them . Q . How were they telling the money ? Keys . One of them was telling it out of her hand into the other 's hand . Q . How much money was there ? Keys . There were about seven or eight shillings . I went to lay hold of one of the women , and up came a fellow behind me in a blue waistcoat , and a tall fellow in a greasy frock , like a butcher . Q . Was the fellow in the greasy frock there when you came up ? Keys . No , he was not there then ; one of them ( he in the blue waistcoat ) had a knife in his hand , like a butcher 's knife ; he swore a great oath , that he would be the death of me , if I assisted the Prosecutor in taking the women . I went into Shoe lane , and called out watch , and said , there was a man robbed . I met the Prosecutor in Shoe Lane ; and he told me the women were run away ; he would have pursued them then , but I said , I will not go after them now , for they have knives , and we shall be in danger of our lives : he asked me my name , I told him I lived at the Cross Keys Tavern in the Strand ; and when the Prisoners were taken up , he sent me word of it . Q . Do you know the women ? Keys . Yes . Q . Look at the Prisoners , are you sure those are the women ? Thorn . I know the Prisoners , are the women . That woman in the checked gown [ Ann Rush ] had a knife in her hand . Q . Did you know them before that time ? Keys . I did not know them before that night . Q . Did you hear the men that came up say any thing to the women ? Keys . The women said to the men , they had got but seven or eight shillings ; and one of the men said , D - n you , I wish it had been as many pounds ; and the women said so too ; and one of the women threatened to stick me with a knife . Q . Who took the hat off ? Keys . Ann Rush took it off . John Berry . I live in Chick Lane . Q . What are you ? Berry . I deal in horses . [ Henry Sims , who was in the bail dock , called out aloud , he is a thief-taker , my Lord . ] Berry . I have detected some of them in Black Boy Alley , because they were a pest to Gentlemen who go that way ; but I am a great dealer in horses . Q . Do you know who that is that says you are a thief-taker ? Berry . I believe that is Gentleman Harry , he is as great a rogue as any in the world . I have known him these twenty years ; I knew him when he was postilion to Mr . Hide . [ Sims cried out again , he is a very great thief-taker , my Lord . ] Berry . He is a very great rogue , 't is a pity he had not his deserts as some others have had . The Prosecutor came to me , and informed me , he was robbed such a time by two women ; gave me a description of them , and told me they used Black Boy Alley and Chick Lane . There is a hill near that place , where twenty or thirty will fit together , may sometimes forty or fifty of them will fit together in the day time , smoaking their pipes and drinking . I took him to a place , where there were I believe four or five of them together ; he fixed upon the Prisoners , and said , they were the two women that robbed him : I said , if we were to attempt to take them then it would be dangerous , and we might run the risque of our lives ( for they are a pesterous sort of people , there is a great resort of them there , and they grow very troublesom ; indeed there are more women than men now , because the men have been pestered very much lately ) so I did not think it safe to take them then , and we took them about two o'clock in the morning in Chick Lane . Philip Price . I am a watchman in Shoe Lane . On the 9th of May , between one and two in the morning , one Lloyd laid hold of the Prisoners in Chick Lane . I know these are the women that were taken then . Greenaway . I know none of these persons but Mr. Price the watchman . I know nothing of it ; I never do concern myself with any of the men kind whatsoever . Rush . I was going that night into Field Lane , two men met me , and would have dragged me about ; I called Mr. Price to come to my assistance , but he did not come ; I am innocent of the robbery they charge me with .

Acquitted . 287 . + Jeremiah Burton , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing a silver watch with a steel seal , value 50 s. the property of Richard Brown , privately from his person , May 2 . Richard Brown . I am Valet de Chambre to my Lord Essingham Howard . On the second of this month when his Majesty went to the house of Lords , I went with my master 's robes , and as I was coming from the house with his Lordship 's robes under my arm ( there being a great croud ) the Prisoner at the Bar pushed very hard upon me , and I found my watch was drawing away , and immediately it was gone : the Prisoner looked me full in the face , and being close to me , I suspected him : I laid hold of him , and said , I take you on suspicion of stealing my watch . I saw one Mr. North a Marshal 's man , and charged him with the Prisoner . I went to carry my Lord 's robes home , and came back again , got a coach , and Mr. North and another person assisted me to carry him before Sir Thomas De Veil , but before we carried him there I took him to an alehouse , the Robin Hood and Little John , and the people told him he had better confess the fact , return the watch , and go about his business ; he said he knew nothing of it , but he said there was a man in a blue grey coat that was near me , who was suspected of doing these things . I said , if he would get me my watch again , I should be glad , for I wanted to go about my business ; and I proposed his depositing five guineas as a security for the watch ; and the people advised him to send for a friend to bring some money : the Prisoner sent a man with a note to the Goat at Charing Cross for the man to come to him , and sent another to carry a note to a friend of his in Paul 's Alley Aldersgate Street , for five guineas as a security for the watch , and it was to be deposited in Mr. North 's hand , for I only wanted a security for my watch to be lodged in his hand : when we went from the alehouse he was carried to Mr. North 's house , and about nine or ten o'clock a porter came to ask for Mr. North , and said he had a parcel for him : Mr. North said to me , I 'll lay you 20 l. there 's your watch again : the porter was admitted into the room , and I had my watch again : this is the watch I lost that day . Q . How did you get the watch again ? Brown . It was brought me in a little bit of rag by the porter to Mr. North 's house . Q . You charge the Prisoner with taking your watch from you , how do you know he took it ? Brown . I do n't know that he took the watch from me . Q . Did you let the Prisoner go ? Brown . Not till I had my watch again ; when I had my watch again , Mr. North said , you must go before a Magistrate before the Prisoner can be discharged . We went before Justice Fraser , and we were to tell him we had some words and a quarrel in the Park , and I came to have him discharged : ( not knowing so well as a great many people do , ) and the Justice said it was a felony , and he could not discharge him . Prisoner . He said if I would give him five guineas he would make it up with me . Brown . I did not want any thing more than my watch again . Prisoner . You ca n't say I took the watch from you ? Brown . I ca n't swear that you took the watch from me , but I verily believe if I had not secured you , I should never have had my watch again . Prisoner . I did not take it , I know nothing at all of the taking it from you . Jury . Why did not you search him ? Prisoner . They did search me . Brown . They always have their accomplices ready to take any thing from them . Charles Cleave . I live in Plumb Tree Court by the New Market . I have known the Prisoner about five years , he is a poulterer by trade , and married a cap maker : I have bought several caps of him . Q . Where was his settlement ? Cleave . It was in Aldersgate Street at one Philip Emms 's . - I believe he lodged there about two months ago - he lived about four years ago in Three Tun Court in Redcross Street . Q . What is his character as to his honesty ? Cleave . I think he had a good character , I never knew that he was ever charged with any such thing before . Matthew Bates . I have known the Prisoner ten years , he was a poulterer , he kept a house in Three Tun Court , and followed cap making . Q . How long is it since you saw him ? Cleave . I have not seen him for about three months . Q . Where do you live ? Cleave . I keep the White Bear Inn in Old Street . He used to come often to my house , and frequently brought parcels of caps to sell . William Tinling . I have known the Prisoner about seven years , and never knew any thing amiss of him . Q . What was his business ? Tinling . He used to go about with rabbets and fowls , but he has left that off about a year . Q . What Business are you ? Tinling . I belong to the Crown Office . I have bought fowls and rabbets of him , and I believe him to be an honest man . Another witness said she had bought black velvet caps of him for hostlers for about four years , and believed him to be a very honest man . Guilty , Death . 288 . + Sarah Moore , otherwise Phillis Cox , otherwise Phillis Booker of St. Mary Le Bow , was indicted for stealing a silk handkerchief , value 12 d. the goods of Henry Barnes , privately from his person , May 17 . Henry Barnes . On the 16th of this month , about twelve o'clock at night , I was going from Black Friars to St. Catherine 's , and passing along Cheapside , the Prisoner and another young woman followed me ; my coat was open , and my handkerchief was in my coat pocket , for I had it but just before : I said to the Prisoner you have got my handkerchief , and the Prisoner gave it me , and said , there 's your handkerchief . Q . Which of the women took it out of your pocket ? Barnes . I can not tell . Q . Is the Prisoner the woman ? Barnes . I believe she is the woman . Q . Do you think she is the woman ? Barnes . I think it was her . Q . Was she taken up directly ? Barnes . She was taken up presently . Q . Is the Prisoner the woman who was presently taken up upon that occasion ? Barnes . She is the person . Q . What become of the other woman ? Barnes . She was committed to the workhouse . Q . Did you put your hand into your pocket to feel whether your handkerchief was there ? or did you only put your hand into your pocket occasionally ? Barnes . I put it in to feel for my handkerchief to wipe my face . Q . Was not you in liquor ? Barnes . I had been drinking pretty plentifully of Yorkshire ale . Q . Do you think you had your senses so as to know what you did ? Barnes . Yes ; I knew very well what I did Prisoner . He was very much in liquor . Q . Was you sober ? Barnes . I was pretty merryish , I went home very well that night . Prisoner . You did not charge me in the watch-house with taking it . Barnes . I did charge you with it in the watch-house . Prisoner . Ask him whether he was not so much in liquor that he fell down in the watch-house . Barnes . I did not fall down at all . Prisoner . The Constable desired me to give him the handkerchief , and said he must prosecute me ; and one talked of a reward of 10 l. and another talked of 10 l. it is only for the sake of the reward . Barnes . When I took her up , the Constable said there was a reward of 10 l. for every one that was taken in the city . Prisoner . He said in the watch-house he would not charge either of the women with the handkerchief . Barnes . I did not say any such thing . Thomas Rybright . The 16th of this month at midnight the watchmen came to the watch-house about twelve o'clock at night with the Prosecutor , the Prisoner and another woman ; the Prosecutor appeared to me to be as sober as he is now , and talked as reasonably as he does now , but the women appeared to be almost fuddled . The Prosecutor said , Mr. Constable , I have had my handkerchief picked out of my pocket , and I desire you would take charge of these women . I asked the Prisoner how she came by the handkerchief ; she said the Prosecutor desired her to take it out of his pocket , and he said , he did not say any such thing . When we came before the sitting Alderman , she said she took it out of the right side waistcoat pocket ; but when it came to be examined , it was so bad it would not hold a handkerchief ; then she said she took it out of the left side pocket , and that was as bad . Q . Did they talk any thing of the reward ? Barnes . The watchmen I believe did talk of the reward , but I did not much mind what they said ; I believe nobody here does it for the sake of the reward . Prisoner . The Constable persuaded him to call upon him again in the morning , and told him , if he let me go he would not have the 10 l. it is only for the sake of the 10 l. that they do this . Q . Did you order him to prosecute her for the sake of the reward ? Rybright . I told him I understood the Prisoner was a common nusance , and that prosecuting her would be doing his country justice . Prisoner . The Prosecutor said he did this for the sake of the 10 l. Barnes . I never said such a thing ; I can call a great many people to my reputation , for I always behaved well . Prisoner . They drank two shillings in beer , which I gave to the watchmen , and they wanted me to give them a crown , but I would not ; I said I have no business to give you a crown when I never did any body any harm . Q . What money did the Prisoner give the watchmen ? Rybright . I did see one of the women put something into a watchman 's hand , but what it was I ca n't tell . Barnes . There was no beer while I was there . Rybright . There was a man before the sitting Alderman , who I believe is one of the thieftakers , and he said the Prisoner was one of the Black Boy Alley crew . Q . Where do you live ? Prisoner . I live in Goswell Street . Elizabeth Wilks . I have known the Prisoner several years , I never heard any thing of misbehaviour of her in my life . Q . What business does she follow ? Wilks . She buys and sells old clothes . Q . What business are you ? Wilks . I keep a shop at Aldersgate , I have lived there 17 or 18 years . Ann Martin . I know nothing of the Prisoner , she is an entire stranger to me . I happened to be coming that way by accident , and they were pulling and hawling the poor woman about . I asked what was the matter ; I said it was a shame they should do so , and she said they had charged her wrongfully ; and she desired to know where I lived : and a man said , I do n't know what they pull the woman for , for I do n't know that I have lost any thing . Q . Who was it that said so ? was it the Prosecutor ? Martin . I do n't know who it was , it was a man 's voice . Q . How long is this ago ? Martin . It is about a fortnight ago as near as I can remember the time . Q . How many men were there ? Martin . I believe there were two or three men . Barnes . There was not above a minute 's distance between my losing my handkerchief and her being in custody . There were no more than two women there ; I am sure you was not there . Martin . I did not stay long . Acquitted . 289 . + Benjamin Stevens , was indicted for that he on the 26th day of April , in the 18th year of his Majesty 's reign , upon Sarah his wife , in the peace of God . & c. feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , did make an assault , and with a certain knife , of the value of one penny , which he then had and held in his right hand , in and upon the left side of the breast , between the fourth and fifth ribs , feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , did strike and stab , and thereby gave her one mortal wound of the breadth of one inch , and of the depth of three inches , of which she instantly died ; and therefore the J urors say , that he she said Benjamin Stevens , the said Sarah his wife , feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice asorethought , did kill and murder against his Majesty 's peace , & c . He was a second time charged by virtue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said murder . Sarah Connell . The Prisoner and his wife lodged in my house . Q . Look at the Prisoner , do you know him ? Connell . Yes ; it is Benjamin Stevens ; I came here to speak the truth . Q . How long did they lodge in your house ? Connell . They had been about a month there : it is a ready furnished lodging , and they have a lock and key to themselves . The action was done three doors off my house : they lodge in a separate apartment from my house . Q . When was this done ? Connell . It was done the Friday before May Day : the deceased was alive and well , and came to me with a pair of upper leathers between three and four in the afternoon . Q . What is your husband ? Connell . My husband is a cordwainer , and the Prisoner is the same , and his wife closed upper leathers for the trade . About three quarters of an hour after six the Prisoner came to my house , and desired I would go into the chamber to his wife ; he was in a good deal of confusion and disorder . I asked him what was the matter ; he said he was afraid she was dead : I said I hoped there had been no quarrel , or that she had not fell into a fit . Q . Did she use to fall into fits ? Connell . I can not tell : he said he wished I would make haste up , for there was a great effusion of blood : I said , I hoped they had not been quarrelling ; he said with a great deal of concern , it was a very bad quarrel , for he was afraid she was dead . Said I , I hope you have not killed your wife ; he said , he had given a helping hand to it , for she was stabbed ; I told him I was sadly surprized at it . Q . How came he to tell you this ? Connell . I can not tell ; he came himself . Q . Was he drunk or sober ? Connell . I thought he was very sober ; he always behaved himself in a very handsom manner . Q . Did he behave well to her ? Connell . He always behaved in a very pretty handsom manner to her , and as I think in a very loving manner . Q . Did the Prisoner offer to run away ? Connell . I 'll tell you by and by . My husband said , why do n't you go ? I said , I did not care to go among blood by myself , so Rose Dockery and Ann Nugent went with me : we found her in naked bed , in her shift , and dead , but to all appearance , and my belief , when I first saw her , I thought she was fast asleep . I turned down the bed clothes , and there was a wound through her shift into her left breast . Q . How came she to be in bed in the afternoon ? Connell . He said he had been in bed too , and by the bed it appeared as if he had been in bed too ; for when they had got a drop of liquor , they used to go to bed . Q . How came the Prisoner to come and tell you such a story , and not run away ? Connell . I can not tell . I desired Ann Nugent to go for a Constable , and not to make any noise about it , for if he should know of a Constable being sent for , he may go off ; and I will go and keep him in discourse till the Constable comes ; so she went to Mr. Oake a Constable in the Coal Yard . I thought to find the Prisoner in my husband 's room , but when I came he was gone . I was very angry at it , and said , there was a very barbarous murder committed , and we should be undone . Q . Had they quarrelled that day ? Connell . I never heard of any quarrel before . Q . How came you to conceive he had done such a barbarous murder ? Connell . I had not known it if he had not come and told me . Q . Do you think he was sober when he told it you ? Connell . I think he was as sober then as he is now . Q . Did you search the wound ? Connell . No ; I only laid my hand upon her head and forehead ; as she lay quite still , I spoke to her , and desired if she had any breath in her to move or lift up her eyes , but she did not do either . I went there afterwards , and the Prisoner with us , and there was this knife upon the seat that he worked upon [ a shoemaker 's knife . ] I asked him how the knife came there ; he said he put it upon the seat himself . The knife was bloody , and there were no sparkles of blood upon her fingers , hands , or face , and hardly any upon the sheet . Q . Was there any great quantity of blood ? Connell . The blood run through the bed upon the ground , but there was no blood upon the upper sheet . There was no appearance as if she had made any struggling or opposition , and it is my opinion she was killed in her sleep . Prisoner . Did you ever hear me give my wife an ill word , but only good words , and good usage ? Connell . I never did indeed , Mr. Stevens ; I never heard any words between you . Edmund Killick . On the 27th of April I was sent for to open the body of the deceased ; upon viewing the body I found a wound on the left side of the breast , I examined the wound , and found it two inches transversed near the sternon into the pericardium , and into the left ventricle of the heart , and this must be attended with sudden death . I put this knife into the wound , and it fitted exactly . Q . Are you of opinion that she was asleep when the wound was given ? Killick . It is most probable that she was asleep , because there was no spring of blood : there can be no circulation of the blood without its going into the left ventricle of the heart . Richard Oake . On the 26th of April Mrs. Connell sent a person to acquaint me that she was afraid there was murder committed ; I immediately went and found the deceased bloody in bed , with the bed clothes turned a little way down : I took her by the hand , and found she was dead . Q . Did you see any knife there ? Oake . Yes . Q . Was the knife bloody ? Oake . The knife was bloody , and there was a great deal of blood in the bed , and upon the bed . I went to his master Purdue 's where he worked and enquired for him , and desired them , if he came to lay hold of him , and send for me , for I believe he had murdered his wife . I went to several houses in Clare Market where the shoemakers use , and could not find him . I went to the house where he lodged before , and he was not there , but they gave him a very good character ; then I went back to my house , and found him there drinking a pot of beer with two men . I told him I must take him into custody ; he said he was very willing to surrender himself to me . I said , are you the husband of that unfortune woman who is murdered ? Yes , said he ; I am the unfortunate man who gave her that mortal wound . He seemed to be vastly concerned , and said , he could freely take the knife and cut his throat for what he had done . He said he believed he should be hanged , and desired nothing but to submit to justice ; and desired I would not let him be ill used by the mob . Then he prevaricated , and said , she had got the knife at her breast , and that she said , Now you rogue thrust it in ; and that he thrust the knife into her breast . Prisoner . Did not I surrender myself voluntarily ? Oake . You made no resistance . Q . Why did not you surrender yourself in the same house where you committed the fact ? Stevens . I was in such a distraction that I did not know what I did . Ann Nugent . I went with Mrs. Connell , and saw the deceased lye dead in her bed with only her shift on . Rose Dockery . I went up stairs with Mary Connell between five and six o'clock , and saw the dead body all in her gore , and I saw some blood under the bed upon the ground ; and there was a knife which was bloody , and lay upon the seat ; I think this is the knife . Sir Thomas De Veil . The Prisoner was brought before me , and desired to make a voluntary confession . I read the confession twice to him , and he signed it voluntarily and freely , and was very sober . I told him I believed it would be the finishing stroke for him : he seemed to be very penitent , and said , he made this confession of his own accord . The voluntary confession of Benjamin Stevens , taken before Sir Thomas De Veil , April 27 , 1745 . He says , ' That on the 27th of April in ' the evening , he had a quarrel with his wife ' Sarah Stevens , that she put a shoemaker 's ' knife to her breast , and bid him kill her , ' and that he thrust the knife into her breast : ' and that they had lived many years in discord . ' And he says that he is sorry for his ' crime , and readily submits himself to justice . ' Sworn Apr . 26 , 1745 . Signed voluntarily , Benjamin Stevens . Prisoner . I had sent her out to buy some victuals , and she came home twice without any : she went out the third time , and I followed her : we went and drank two or three pints of beer , and she drank a dram , for she has been very much addicted to drinking . I persuaded her to go home and go to bed , and I did design to go to bed , in order to get up betimes in the morning . She took the knife off the seat , which is just by the bed , and desired I would kill her , and I dissuaded her from it , and we both struggled , and both fell down upon the bed , and I fell upon her , and run the knife into her . Connell . It is my opinion she was asleep when she was killed , for I am sure she could not put the knife from her . John Purdue . This unfortunate man has worked for me and my father twenty two or twenty four years , and in all that time I never saw him strike or abuse his wife , but has used her with abundance of good manners . No body knows what he has undergone with her . Q . Did you never see him strike or abuse her ? Purdue . I never saw him abuse her ; whenever she wanted money of me she had it , and he paid me again . She had a shilling of me that day this unhappy accident happened . I was surprized when the Constable and his landlady came to my house , and said , he had killed his wife . Q . You said something of his suffering very much by her , how did he suffer ? Purdue . He did suffer very much , for the poor man could not keep a coat to his back , for she was very much addicted to drinking . He came to my shop about half an hour after the Constable had been there : said I , Stevens , what have you done ? They say you have murdered your wife ; then he said , if I have , I will go and surrender myself to Justice De Veil , and he said he would go to the Constable who lives in the Coal Yard . Q . What time was that ? Purdue . It might be half an hour after six , or near seven . Connell . There was a woman in the room even with the Prisoner 's ; I asked her , if she did not hear any noise , and she made answer , no , and said there was not a word spoke , and she had not been out of the room ; that made me think the deceased was asleep . Oake . The woman said there was no noise or disturbance at all . Mary Wyman . On the 26th or 27th of April , on a Friday night , I heard of this unhappy accident ; I was the more surprized at it , because Mr. Stevens and his wife had always behaved very civilly and endearing to one another : to be sure the woman was very much addicted to drinking ; and he has said , Mrs. Wyman , what must I do with this unhappy woman ? And he said , he was afraid she would make him do what he would not do ; either to make away with her , or to make away with himself . I said , Mr. Stevens , you have had a great deal of patience , and you must have patience . I never heard him abuse her or say that she was a drunkard ; and she was not abusive neither ; for if she got a little liquor , she would go to bed . James Robinson . I belong to a benefit club with Stevens , where they allow some money for burying wives ; and hearing of this accident , I went to look at the woman , and the Prisoner desired me to go up to help his wife , or she would die for want of help : when I saw her , I said to him , you have killed your wife ; God forbid , said he , but we have had a scuffle , and in this scuffle she has got an unlucky cut . She lay close to the side of the bed-stead , and it was easy for her to reach the knife . He is a very temperate man , and I hardly ever heard him swear an oath . Q . Do you think there was a sign of any struggling ? Robinson . I can not tell , her eyes were open . He is a very honest man , I have known him some years ; she was very much given to drinking , and he always gave her the best of words , I never heard him give her a miss word . Mary Robinson . I am wife to the last witness ; he keeps a publick house in Drury Lane ; I have heard the deceased say , the Prisoner had attempted to make away with himself . Henry Bell . I lodged in the house with Stevens , and I never heard but he used his wife well , but she was very much addicted to drinking ; and he would take her and lead her up stairs , and put her to bed . I never heard him give her an unhandsom word in my life . Q . How long time do you speak to ? Bill . For about a year , when he lived at Mrs. Wyman 's : he has said , when I went into the fields along with him , that he never would come back to Drury Lane , for he would make away with himself , and I believe sometimes he was not in his senses . Mary Connell . The Prisoner and his wife did live in my house about three quarters of a year , and I never saw any thing amiss of him . Elizabeth Williams . I have known the Prisoner about five years ; I have seen the deceased in liquor , and she has attempted to make away with herself , and he has taken the knife out of her hand , in his own room . Joseph Owen [ at Clements inn ] I am an attorney . I have known the Prisoner eight or nine years ; he worked for me , and was a man of a sober conservation and good morals . I have often had occasion to go to his apartment ( for I have done business for him sometimes , and he has recommended me to others to draw bonds , & c. ) and I have heard him talk of parting with his wife , but he would not for fear she should want bread . Guilty Death . 290. Ann Berry , of Christ Church Spittle-fields , was indicted for stealing a silver spoon , val . 7s . the goods of John Preston , Feb. 14th . John Preston . I keep a publick house in Spittle Fields . I lost a silver spoon , I ca n't say she stole the spoon ; but I found it at a pawnbroker 's in Rag Fair [ the Prosecutor had two spoons in his hand ] I lost one of these spoons . Q . Where does the Prisoner live ? Preston . She has lived about two years in my house , as one of our own family , and I never knew any thing amiss of her . Mary Burton . The Prisoner came to my house , to desire me to do an errand for her , and that was to pawn a spoon for the gentlewoman at the Paul 's Head [ Mrs . Preston . ] She said , Mrs. Preston had some words with her husband , and gave her this spoon out of her pocket apron to pawn , because she had no money to give her ; and I knew she was as intimate in the house , as if she had lived there , and she pawned it for 7 s. to one Mrs. Ireland . Q. to Preston . Do you believe your wife lent the spoon to the Prisoner , in order to raise money to pay her ? Preston . No , I am sure not in any shape . Q . She says , your wife and you had some words ; how do you know but she might ? Preston . And please you my Lord , if I must speak I must . The maid was ill , and my wife desired the Prisoner to carry some broth to the maid , and gave her a silver spoon to carry to her ; and in the evening after she was gone , when I came to look for the spoon , the spoon and the saucepan were both gone . I lent her 10 s. 7 d. to serve her , and she wanted to borrow a crown more . I hope , gentlemen , you 'll be as favourable to her as you can . Prisoner . The gentleman has been pleased to say to this hour , that he would not take 20 pounds for what he has got by me . I did not think it worth while to send for any witnesses , I left myself to the gentleman 's and your honour 's goodness . Acquitted . 291 . + Henry Simms * , was indicted for stealing two perriwigs , val . 30 s. the goods of Joseph Spence , three perriwigs , val . 7 s. the goods of Talbot Waterhouse , one perriwig , val . 2 s. the goods of John Demaine , one perriwig , val . 20 s. the goods of Robert Scott , one perriwig , val . 2 s. the goods of John Seaaton , a cloth coat , val . 2 s. the goods of William Anthone , a cloth coat , val . 2 s. and a cloth waistcoat , val . 6 d. the goods of Gabriel Stewart , in the dwelling house of William Anthone , Aug. 20th . in the 16th year of his Majesty 's reign . * Henry Simms [ who we have hitherto called Sims , ] otherwise Young Gentleman Harry , made an information before Sir Thomas De Veil , against William Gibbs , Richard Swift , and William Cavenagh , that he , together with the aforesaid persons , Samuel Baker , and Samuel Smith , otherwise Black Sam , broke , and entered the dwelling house of Nathan Smith in Southwark ; and stole money and goods to a great value ; for which the three first mentioned persons were tried , at the last assizes held at Croydon , for the County of Surry ; on which trial the Prisoner swore that he was perjured in his information before Sir Thomas De Veil , and that every thing he had swore therein , with relation to that burglary , was false . See the proceedings at last Croydon assizes , in which are contained the information of Henry Sims relating thereto , and the aforementioned trial & c. Published by M. Cooper , in Pater-noster Row .

I am a barber and perriwig maker , I keep a shop at the corner of the Bell Inn , in the Hay Market ; and a boy lies in the shop : but my house is in Panton Street . About two or three years ago , upon a Sunday evening my apprentice came home fuddled ; the shop was broke open and robbed , and he was found lying upon the bed drunk , and his buckles taken out of his shoes , and the hat off his head , and the goods mentioned in the indictment were lost . One opera night , a chairman came to me , and asked me for something for bringing home my boy ; said I , I suppose you are the man that robbed the shop ; if you want any thing , here is a broomstick for you , that is the best way of paying you , I have paid enough already . About a fortnight or three weeks before last sessions , some gentlemen came , and asked me what I was robbed of , I told them , and went to Sir Thomas De Veil , and gave him an account what I was robbed of . Q . What gentlemen were they , that came to enquire of you ? Anthone . I ca n't tell . Simms . They are thief takers , my Lord : pray did you ever see me ? Anthone . I never saw you . You sent to me to desire me to make it a single felony . Gabriel Stewart . About three years ago , I was pretty much in liquor , and two men , as they told me , brought me home in a chair . The next morning about four o'clock , I awaked , and I found my self upon the bed in my clothes , and the boxes all about the shop , the shop was broke open and my master was robbed of nine wigs and a coat ; and I lost a coat and waistcoat , a pair of breeches and a hat . Mr. Joshua Brogden , clerk to Sir Thomas De Veil , deposed , That on the 20th day of Feb. last , Henry Simms , otherwise young gentleman Harry , the Prisoner at the bar , was brought before Sir Thomas De Veil by a Constable of Covent Garden parish , for an assault which he had committed the night before , in the house of one Mrs. Coggin : That upon examination it appeared , he had broke out of New Prison Clerkenwell the same night ; and it being fully proved upon him , he then desired to speak to Sir Thomas and his clerk in private , for he could make large discoveries : upon which Sir Thomas told him , he would hear what he had to say , and therefore desired all the people to withdraw , which they accordingly did . That Sir Thomas advised him to be very cautious what he was doing , for if he declared any false thing it would turn upon himself . That he took his information , which was made voluntarily , and without any promise of pardon or reward , and then Sir Thomas swore him to it : t hat after he had taken his information , which he signed voluntarily , he took his confession , which was also signed freely and voluntarily .

On the 26th April I was ill in bed , and about eleven o'clock in the forenoon I heard my servant , Sarah Taylor , cry out in a violent manner , Ha Master ! and afterwards Thief ; first I thought I heard her in the entry , and afterwards in the street . I dressed myself and came down ; my shop was full of people , and the thief was brought back to my house : these are my goods . Sarah Taylor . I was at the door between ten and eleven in the morning , I came in , and shut the door after me . Q . What door ? Taylor . An entry door that comes into the shop , not the street door . I went through the shop into a little room , and heard a noise in the shop . I went into the shop , and saw the Prisoner in the entry with these goods under his arm , and he went out into the street with them . I went out at the door , and cried , Ha Master ! and then cried out , Stop Thief . He was taken with the goods under his arm before he was out of sight . James Grimault . I saw the Prisoner peeping in at the corner of the sash of the shop where there were some silk handkerchiefs . I saw him go in at the door without any thing under his arm , and he was not a minute before he came out with these checques under his arm : they were all loose , and I judged he could not be long enough to chaffer for them ; and presently the maid came out , and cried , master , stop ; so I took him by the collar , and carried him back to the shop .
