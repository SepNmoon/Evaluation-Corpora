Thomas Rickets , was indicted for privately stealing a silver hilted Sword , value 20s . from the Person of Edmund Baugh , July 9 . Edmund Baugh . On Friday Night , July 9 , about 10 o'Clock , I was going from the Tavern to my Chambers in the Temple ; at the middle Temple Gate the Duchess of Marlborough and Mr. Green were sitting in her Chariot . I stop 'd to look at her , and in a very few Minutes , I found my Sword was taken from my side . I do n't know the Prisoner , nor can I swear he took it ; but missing my Sword , I cry 'd out - Sword lost - stop Thief ; the Mob set out and run beyond Temple-Bar , I run after them , and the Prisoner was taken at the Ship Tavern . I asked him if he had got my Sword , he said no . Sir , says I , have you given it any Body ? No , says he . What made you run away then ? He said he did not run away . It was pretty late and we could not find a Magistrate ; so I charged a Constable with him , and carried him to the Compter . The next Day I carried him before the Lord Mayor . John Smith will give you farther Evidence . John Smith . I know the Prisoner . I did keep a House at the Ditch-side , and have often been afraid of being robb 'd by him . The Night the Fact was committed , the Dutchess of Marlborough was in her Coach at the middle Temple Gate : I stood by the Prosecutor to see her , and observed the Prisoner draw the Sword from his side , and could have detected him before he had quite drawn it out ; but a Man ( one of his Gang I suppose ) clapp 'd me on the Shoulder , and asked me whose Coach that was ; I told him whose it was , and before I could turn again , the Prisoner was gone , and the Mob was running after him . He ran thro ' the Bar , and was taken at a Chymist 's Door , one of the Houses that was burnt down . This was on Friday , July 9. about 10 o'Clock at Night . Mr. Baugh . I should have told your Lordship , that the Sunday following , I was informed a Person came , while I was at Church , to offer me my Sword again . Prisoner . Ask Smith , Why he did not tell the Gentleman all this , the Night I was taken ? Mr. Baugh . I did ask , when the Prisoner was taken , if any Body could tell who took my Sword , and Smith only said , he saw the Prisoner run without the Bar ; he did not inform me that he saw him take it , 'till next Morning . Smith . I live by St. George 's Church in Southwark , and having so far to go home that Night , I was afraid , if I discovered the whole Matter that Night , that I should be mis-used in my way Home by some of his Gang ; this was the Reason I did not tell the Gentleman till next Morning : He laid hold of me at Sir William Billers 's Office that Night . Mr. Baugh . The Prisoner at the Coffee-House under the Office , call 'd for a Pint of Beer , said he could pay for it as well as any of us , and spurted good Part of it into Smith 's Face and down his Bosom . The Prisoner had nothing material to offer in his Defence , nor any Witnesses , either to the Fact or his Character . Guilty of the Indictment . Death . 2. Ann Weakley of St. Botolph Aldgate , was indicted for stealing twelve yards of green Ribbon , value 6 s. 6 d. the Goods of Richard Neve . June 24 John Oldsworth . My Master is a Haber-dasher , and the Prisoner used the Shop . We suspected her , and counted the Ribbons over , and set the Number on the Box . On the 24th of June , she came for half a yard of 8 penny Ribbon . I served her , and the Minute she was gone , I missed the Ribbon . My fellow Servant ran after her , and brought her back , we searched her ; but found nothing upon her . John Pottinger . My fellow Servant and I had counted the Ribbons over a little before she came into the Shop ; the former Witness served her , and the Minute she was gone , he told me , he missed a piece of Ribbon , green Saxe Gotha ; and I am positive it was in the Drawer just before . I pursued her , and took her in the Little Minories Gate way , and brought her back ; then we got a Constable and carry 'd her before a Justice , and at the Bull Head in Bread street , she said , if my Master would be favourable , she would tell us where the Ribbon was , and according to her Directions , we found it hid behind some Shutters , which stand under that Gate-way . I pushed the Shutters , and the Ribbon fell down . Richard Hedges confirmed the former Evidence . Guilty . 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 3. Avis Nutton , was indicted for stealing twelve yards of printed Callicoe Borders for Petticoats , value 10 s. and seven yards of Cambrick , value 3 l. 10 s. the Goods of Thomas Wiseham , out of his Shop , April 5 . Thomas Wiseham . The Prisoner came to my Shop , on Monday , April 5 , between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon . I was full of Customers , so she told me she would stay till I had served the Ladies . After they were gone , she came up to the Compter , and said she wanted some printed Borders and printed Linnen ; she bid me a Trifle for what I shewed her , and asked me for a little Beer . As she appeared well dress , I took a glass Mug , and went down my self to draw her some Beer ; she met me at the Top of the Cellar stairs , drank the Beer and I asked her if she would have any more she curt'sied and said , if I pleased she would . I went down again , and gave her Beer the second time , which she drank , and then went out of the Shop as fast as she could , without buying any thing , but before she went , she told me if I thought she had robbed me I might search her . I told her she appeared to me to be another sort of a Woman . As soon as she was gone I missed the Borders . They are particular Things which none in England have besides myself D - her says I to my Brother , the Bitch has stollen them ; I looked out after her , but she was gone . On Wednesday she came again , I was not at Home , but my Brother came to fetch me Home . Madam , says I , your humble Servant . You are mistaken Sir says she , I have not been at your Shop before , it was my Sister , we are very much alike . She said she wanted half a yard of Linnen , but she had left the Pattern at Home , and would fetch it . Three of us followed her that we might see where she lived , but we lost her . On the Friday the Week following , she came again for some Borders , and two Women were with her , she bid me a Price , which she said she had given me for the same things before . Then she asked me , what was become of the Borders that hung up when she was there before ; Madam , says I , I will make you know you have robbed me of them , and sent for a Constable ; she fell on her Knees , and begged me for God 's Sake not to prosecute her , if I did , I should ruin an honest Man , who had been her Husband sixteen years . Some of my Borders she had sold to Mrs. Drake of Bow , who shew 'd me them , and told me , she bought them of Mrs. Nutton . The Roll I lost came from the Printer 's but the Saturday before ; the Cambrick was worth 4 l. 10s . - and this I never found . William Wiseman 's Evidence was to the same Effect . Mary Toller . I can only say , the Prisoner called to see me once with two Parcels of printed Linnen ; that she said , she did not know what she had got , nor the Price ; but that she had got those Things for a Debt ; and as she did not know what to do with them herself , she would sell them . I took them to be Robeings of Gowns . Isabella Kaywood confirmed Toller 's Evidence , but could not swear these Goods to be the same that Mr. Wiseman produced . Ann Drake . I bought these Borders of the Prisoner , and they are the same that the Constable took out of my House . I had six yards in all , at one shilling a yard , which was the Price she said she gave for them . Thomas Wiseham . These are the same I lost . Constable . These are the very Things we found at Mrs. Drake 's . Rice Price . I was charged with her when she was taken , she did fall on her Knees , begged he would not prosecute her , and offered to pay what the Things came to . Sarah Clayton and Sarah Harwood , gave an Account of the Prosecutor 's harsh and passionate Behaviour , when the Prisoner was seized , and spoke to her Character . Several others gave her the Character of an honest reputable Woman . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Branding . See summary . ] 4 , 5.

On the 22d of June 1 found her in the Hands of Francis Wright , a Brewer in Ealing ; I swear 't is the Mare I lost . Mr. Wright bought her of Thomas Haines , and Haines bought her of the Prisoner . Thomas Haines . I bought this Mare of the Prisoner , about Alhallontide last , and gave him my Note for the Money 8 l. in Grosvenor-street , near Grosvenor square , and I sold her again to Mr. Wright , a Brewer at Ealing , and there the Prosecutor found her .

Thomas Boniface . I took the Prisoner Mahon , about 3 o ' Clock in the Morning , on Sunday , July 4. in Windmill-street . I carry 'd her to the Round house , and thence to Justice De Veil . Henry Gould . On the 28th of June about 10 at Night , I was coming through Coventry-Court , near the Hay market , and saw Rose Mahon at a Door , and she asked me to walk up Stairs with her . Mahon . Do n't say so my Dear , - do n't tell that Lye . Gould . I was pretty merry , and though I never saw her before , I went up one pair of Stairs , at one Mrs. Maxwell 's , and says I , I have got no Money to satisfy you ; well , well , says she , no matter for that I was not so much in Liquor as she thought me to be ; she thought I suppose , I could not miss my Watch . We went into a Room where there was a Bed , and she fell immediately to opening the Waistband of my Breeches . I asked her what she meant by that ? O says she my Dear , nothing , - I will please you , I 'll please you ; and she picked the Watch out of my Fob , and run down Stairs as fast as she could . I cried out to the Woman below , who was with her Daughters in the Passage to stop her , for I had lost my Watch , but she got off ; and I waited in the House from that Time 'till Eight the next Morning . Some Time after she was gone , in came Joseph Shepperd , and he pretended to be Mahon 's Husband . - Q . Had you ever been at this House before ? Gould . Yes , my Lord , I had been there once before . Q . What , is it a Publick House ? Gould . No , 't is not a Publick House ; 't is a House where they keep such Women . Q . Is it a Bawdy House ? Gould . Yes , my Lord . Q . And yet you say you have been there before , do n't you ? Gould . Yes , once before . Q . You knew what the House was , yet you must go there . Gould . I did . So when Shepperd came in , the Woman of the House told him his Wife had done a fine Thing ; she has pick 'd this Gentleman 's Pocket of a Gold Watch ; and , says Shepperd , what Business had he with my Wife , I did not meddle with your Wife , says I , only she has been so good as to run away with my Watch ; if you 'll let me have it again I 'll give you half a Guinea . He said , he would go and see if he could find her , and in a little Time he return 'd with a Butcher of St. James 's Market , and said , she was not to be found ; then they went out again , and returned no more that Night . Mahon . I beg my Lord he may turn his Face to me . I would ask you on the Vertue of your Oath , whether you did not insist upon going up into my Chamber ? Whether , as I was standing at the Door you did not ask me what it was a Clock ? Whether I did not tell you , it was Time for you to be at Home , and whether you did not say , my Dear I 'll not go Home 'till I 've seen your Apartment ? I told you , I did not live there ; you said I did ; why , said you , is not this Rosy ? I stepp 'd up , and he follow 'd me . Gould . My Lord , she ask 'd me to go up Stairs . Council . I would ask you , Sir , whether you never declared to any one , that you gave her the Watch ? Gould . No . I never gave it her , nor did she ever ask for it , she was not so good as to ask me , she took it without asking I thank God I never was in such a Scrape as this before . Mahon . I desire he may be asked , if he did not tell me he had no more than 9d in his Pocket , and whether he did not give that to my Maid ? Gould . She took the 9 d. herself . Mahon . But I gave my Maid your 9 d. Mary Mitchel . I was in the Kitchen at the Red-Lyon Alehouse , in Coventry Court , and in comes Joseph Sheppard ; this was the Night the Watch was lost , and he told us , his Rosy had made a Gold Watch ; I ask 'd him from who ; he said from the King 's Messenger , and described him : He said , he had blue Grey Cloaths on , white Spatterdashes , and a Whip in his Hand . The Watch he said was very heavy , and would pawn for 14 Spankers . Mary Maxwell . That Jo . Sheppard took the Lodging in my House in Coventry Court for him and his Wife , and he never lay out of the House 'till this 28th of June ; then Sheppard came in while the Gentleman was in my House , and he said , if his Wife had done such a Thing he would cut her Nose off , and that he would go and see for her ; but he went up to his Room , and carried off all the Goods . Council . Had you any Discourse with Mr Gould that Night ? Maxwell . He sat all Night in my Room , we must say something to be sure . As to the Watch , I have nothing to do with it : he told me , she had run away with it . He came to my House about 9 a Clock . - Council He says it was 10 . Maxwell . God bless me ; - then the Bells do n't go right about ; it must be but 9 , because when he cry 'd out upon the Stairs , Watch , Watch , I answer 'd , what , Watch call 'd at 9 a Clock ! I know no more o n't . - There 's the Man , I never saw him before , I told him , it was pity if he wanted a Woman , he did not go to his Wife . Sarah Maxwell . The Gentleman came running down Stairs with his Breeches in his Hand , and said his Watch was gone ; I went to the Nagg's-Head and fetch 'd Sheppard home ; when he came in , he set his Elbow thus , and said to Mr. Gould , G - D - you Sir , what Concerns have you with my Wife , - pray what did you give her Sir ? He said 15 d at first , but afterwards he owned it was but 9 d. Sheppard threatned to sue him , for having something to do with his Wife , and went out , but returned no more . Thomas Bonniface . While Mahon was examining before Col. De Viel , some Body brought the Watch ; but who it was I can not tell , this is the Watch . Gould . This is my Watch I declare . Mahon . My Lord , be so good as to hear what I said to the Gentleman . I was standing at my own Door and this Man came by , what 's a Clock my Dear says he ? I told him I could not tell . What 's this Rosy says he ? Yes says I , and smiled , my Lord . My Dear says he , I am just come to Town and have but 9 d. else I would have gone up and drunk with you . Well , says I , come up , and make a Present of that to my Maid , so up he came , and the Maid had the 9d . I sent her out , and then - he said my Dear , trust to my Honour , my Generosity . In the Morning , I 'll pay you . I said I did not chuse that , I owe my Landlady 10 s. give me something in lieu , and accordingly he gave me the Watch in my Bed-chamber , to pawn for four Guineas : My Lord , when a Gentleman is in Privacy with any of us Ladies of the Town , and has no Money , he do n't care it should be known ; I was not willing to let my Servant into the Gentleman 's Case . As I hope to be saved , I was to have two Guineas for myself ; would you be willing , Sir , a Lady should be guilty in that Way , and to make your Case known to a Servant .

I returned Home , and my Wife told me my Man was come to work again . I went up Stairs into my Work Room , and my other Man told me that English had carried out the Cloaths he was about . On Saturday Morning he sent me Word where the Goods were pawn 'd : I got a Search-Warrant , and found all the Things at Mr. Yarp 's in Hounsditch ; and took the Prisoner at Globe-Stairs by Ratcliffe-Cross , and carried him before Justice Priestly , where he owned he took the Things .

We went over the Water and took them ; and before the Justice he owned he took the Goods for Money that the Prosecutor owed him , and the Justice committed him . Prisoner . My Master owed me 20 s. for Wages , and I could not get the Money ; I thought it hard as I was going to Boston , to leave so much Money behind me , so I pawn 'd these Things and sent him Word next Day where they were . I have not any Witnesses , for I gave all my Money to one Mac - something , a Newgate Solicitor , to manage my Cause , and he is run away with the Money and has done nothing . Edward Costecan , had employed and entrusted the Prisoner , and took him to be an honest Man . Acquitted . Second Indictment . Robert Wilson . The 24th of June I had been out , and when I returned I found Seymour standing at my Door ; he told me he was robb 'd by these Irish Villains , and bid me see if I had not been robb 'd too . I went up Stairs and found my Door fast , but he perswaded me to break it open , ( for my Wife had carried away the Key ) and we did so , and found the Things all gone , and my Wife too The Things mentioned in the Indictment , were in a Chest , and were brought some Time before , as a Pledge for four Guineas which my Wife had made me lend the Prisoner . We had heard of their Design of running away together to New England , so we went to the New England Coffee-House and got Intelligence where to take them there we found the Chest , but they were gone over the Water : We got a Waterman who said he 'd give us leave to crop him if he did not take them ; we followed his Advice , and took them , but the Justice let two of them go . He own 'd the Chest was in his Custody , but he said he did not take it out of my Room . Prisoner . That very Day , he had sold his Wife at the George on Tower Hill , for a Pot of Beer , to the Man she ran away with , and I was present . He half starved her , and turned her out of Doors , so we agreed to go to New England , and she took her Cloaths with her , and this Chest of mine that was at their House ; for the Man she ran away with , was a Friend of mine . He swore the Robbery against his Wife . Wilson . I did not . The Lord above knows where my Wife is : I 'm sure I do n't ; she is run away with t'other Irishman . Acquitted . 14.

After this , they talked of taking us out of the Coach , I said they had got all we had , and away they went . I told the Watch and the Neighbourhood we had been robbed , and they pursued them , and that Man at the Bar was taken . Next Morning he was carried before the Lord Carpenter and Justice Ray , at Hanover-Square , and they bound him over . I ca n't take on me to say he was one of the three , for it was past 11 o'Clock at Night . He was taken by the Description we gave of the Robbers , that they were little Fellows , young , and unused to that Way . They were very civil , no Oaths nor Swearing , but , Gentlemen if you do n't deliver , we must take you out of the Coach . Mr. Hussey . I can give but the same Account that Mr. Winston has given . We were attack 'd by three Foot pads , one held a Pistol to my Breast and demanded my Money ; I gave him a Guinea and some Silver , I can not be positive how much , nor can I swear to the Prisoner . He who took the Money from us , went a little Distance and made a Speech , telling us , as they had not done us an Injury , and a Necessity obliged them to do what they did , he hoped we would not pursue them : but his Companions call 'd him away , and bid the Coachman drive on .

I ordered the other Watchman to put out his Light , thinking if they saw our Lights , they would not come near us . In about a quarter of an Hour they came down the Road , I stooped down , that they might not see me ; so , says I , they are coming , to my Companion , and as soon as the Prisoner came up to us , I seized him fast by the Breast ; but while we were attacking him , the other two got off . We went up to the Turn-pike to see what Coach it was that had been robbed , and we found it was the Sissiter ( Cirencester ) Coach , so we went to the Bell-Savage Inn , and found out Mr. Hussey . I did not see the Coach attack 'd , for it was not near the Houses , but so much as it was described upon him ( according to the Description ) he must be the Man . He had these Surgeon 's Instruments about him , and this Stock . William Chambers . I am a Watchman . We had an Account of this Coach being robbed by three Foot Pads ; two of them were described very plainly , by a Man who jumped down from behind it , when the Fact was committed ; so we stopped the Prisoner at the Bar , and the others ran away . He was searched at the Lodge at the Park Gate ; we found some Money upon him , but not much , and two or three Shagreen Cases to hold Lancers , and this Stock , but I did not see any Gold about him . The Robbery was committed about half a Mile beyond my Stand . John Stokes . I was constable that Night the Prisoner was brought to the Watch house ; the next Morning I carried him before the Lord Carpenter , and Mr. Justice Ray , and he confessed the Fact in my hearing , and the Confession was taken in writing , and was signed by the Prisoner .

Adderson . I had the Misfortune to be confined in the Fleet 22 Weeks , and was discharged 3 Weeks ago this very Night . I entrusted this Woman to lye with my Daughter , thinking her to be an honest Woman ; but when I came home , I found all my Things gone : I knew she was absconded before I came out of the Fleet , and have never seen her 'till she was taken up . Several of my Things I found at John Dorman 's , and John Glover 's , two Pawn-brokers , who are here in Court , and can swear they were in my House , when she came there . John Dorman . The Prisoner used to bring things to pawn , and fetched them out again ; I thought she had been entrusted by Adderson with the things , and that it could not be a Felony . She pawned them with me in her own Name ; here 's a List of them . April 12 , an Apron for 1 s. April 22 , a Cap for 1 s. May 24 , an Apron for 1 s. March 4 , a Cloak for 4 s.

May 20 , a Petticoat 7 s. 6 d. May 24 , a Quilt 14 s. 9 d. and with this 14 s. 9 d. she redeemed two Spoons of Mrs. Adderson 's ; so by that I took it she was entrusted with them . Q . Did you entrust the Prisoner to pawn Goods for you ? Adderson . No . Q . Did you commit these Goods to her Custody ? Adderson . No . Q . Then the Pawn-broker is mistaken in his Law . You ought not to have received these Goods , without knowing what Authority she had to pawn them , and you are very faulty in taking them in . Dorman . Here are other Things in the List of Mrs. Addersons , which the Prisoner brought to our House . She always pawn 'd them in her own Name ; and when I asked her any Questions , she always said she was sent . Q . If you thought she was sent , why did you take them in her Name ? John Glover , I took from the Prisoner a check 'd Apron for 18 d. a short silk Apron for 9 d. and a Remnant of new Stuff for 1 s. a Breadth and a half of Muslin for 1 s. She said she brought them from one Elizabeth Cox , but she laid them in her own name . Q . You that receive Goods in pawn ought to be very cautious : You are Nurseries of Thieves , and they would have no vent for stollen Goods , if you did not receive them in pawn . Half the Felonies committed in Town , are owing to this Encouragement . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 32.

I unlocked the Stable Door , and turn 'd her in . He told me he had rid 60 Miles since 10 o'Clock last Night : I felt under the Saddle , and the Mare was but just warm ; she was not heated at all , so I thought it impossible he should have come so far . He asked me to let him go to bed , and I let him lie in my Bed with my two little Children . In the Morning , when the Children got up , he sent them down Stairs to order another Feed of Corn ; and while they were gone , he opened my Box , which was in the Chamber , robbed me of my Money and Watch , and then he went away with the Mare .

She saith , that while she was in the Room , his Wife enquired how he made his Escape ; he told her that pulling out a Knife , he loosened a Stone , and raised it with a Link of his Fetters ; that he then went through into the Funnel , and let the Stone fall ; that he stuck fast in the Funnel , and with Difficulty fell into the Common Shore ; that when he got out of the Shore , he hid himself in an Engine , while the People that pursued passed by . Prisoner . I desire he may be asked , if ever I came to see Malden while he was in Newgate ? Alston . I can not say I ever saw her with him . William Cooper . On Whitsun-Monday at Night , my Servant had been out of an Errand , and he came home , and said , he had seen Malden . You Blockhead , says I , you have heard an old Woman 's Story : No Master , say , he , I have really seen him , and another said he had seen him . Lord bless me , says I , if so many People have seen him , I will go see him my self . I went to Malden 's Wife 's Room and there I saw a Man sitting , with three or four Women round about him : and while I was there he put up his Legs , and pulled up , ( as I thought ) his Trowsers ; but it seems they were the sleeves of his striped Jacket . This was in White 's Yard , in Rosemary Lane : I can not say whose House it was ; I believe it was the Lodging of one of his Wive 's : The Woman they call Malden 's Wife , lives in that Room where I saw him . I did not know him , nor should I know him again if I was to see him ; but I believe it was he , because I saw the Fetters upon his Legs , and the Rivets of a prodigious Bigness , and the great Links of the Chain , and the great Rivets . I can not say I saw Shelton the Prisoner there . Mr. Alston . You told me this very Day , that she was there . Cooper . Well , I believe she was there . I knew the Woman before ; I knew her vastly well ; I live just by her in White 's Yard . Q . How many Women were in the Room when you went in ? Cooper . I can not be positive how many . Q . Did you know any of them ? Cooper . Yes , this Woman ( the Prisoner ) was in the Room ; she was there . Q . Then why do you say , you do not know that she was there ? Cooper . My Lord , I am cautious of hurting any Body . Q . But wo n't you take care not to hurt your self ? now you say she was there . Cooper . Yes ; My Lord , she was there indeed . Q . What occasion 'd his taking up his Trowsers ? Cooper . He took them up in a Bravado , and laugh 'd . I am sure I should know him again , because I saw two of his Teeth in the upper Part of his Mouth broke out . Q . How came you to be admitted into the House ? Cooper . Several People told me they had seen him , and thinks I , this is an idle Fellow , I will go see him too . And they omitted ( admitted ) me into the House , and into the very Room where he was Mrs. Humphries , who lives there sometimes , said , I might go in , and see him , she knocked at the Door , and said - here is Mr. Cooper , so they let me in , and he shewed the Irons on his Legs in a Bravado , and laugh 'd and said , he had more about him here , ( putting his Hands on his Wast ) a great many more . Mr. Nichols . Please to ask Mr. Cooper , if he has not seen Malden in the Prisoner 's Apartment ; he has told the same thing to me . Cooper . It was the Wife 's Room , that I saw him in . Q . Where does the Prisoner live ? Cooper . In the same House , I believe ; but I wo n't be positive . Q . Was you ever in any Room with the Prisoner Shelton ? Cooper . Once or twice , I have been in a Room of hers . Q . Was her Room in the same House ? Cooper . Yes , my Lord . Mr. Alston . My Lord , he owned to me , that he had seen Malden , in the Prisoner 's Room . Cooper . Yes , my Lord , I have been informed , it was Shelton 's Room . Q . Where does Shelton live ? Cooper . Next Door to where I saw Malden , the Houses communicate , only there is a little Row of Pales between . Germane . On Whitsun-Monday , I was drinking at the Corner of White 's Yard , at 12 o'Clock at Night ; the prisoner Shelton came and called me out privately . She asked me , if she might put her Life into my Hands ? I was shocked , and asked her what she meant ? Can I trust you , says she ? I do not know , says I ; why then , says she , Malden has made his Escape out of Jayl , will you come and take his Fetters off ? No , says I , not for an hundred Pounds ; I wo n't wrong my Conscience , my King , nor my Country . She found I would not answer her Ends ; and she desired , if I would not do it , I would not betray him . I told her , I would not be concerned with any of them ; and away I went home to bed , and came not out again , till next Morning . Temperance Germane , confirm 'd the above Evidence Defence . The 14th of June , at Night , I was a Bed , and a Woman who uses Newgate-Market came up and said there was a sad Up roar ; for Malden was got out again . Pshaw says I , 't is impossible , but a Woman that I give 12 d. a Week to , to look after my Children while I am out , comes and says to me , there 's Malden gone up Stairs : with that , says I , if God gives me Leave , I 'll go and see him ; when I came up , he was eating Pig , and he asked me to eat with him , - No , no , says I , eat it yourself . His Wife said , Oh ! Daniel , how did you get out ? and he put his Hand to his Pocket , and pulled out a Knife , by means of which he loosened a Stone , and put his Fetters in , to take it up ; then he went down the Funnel , and there he said he stuck ; but God brought him through it . How will you get your Irons off , says his Wife ? I will go , says I , to Germane 's and get him to take them off ; but he refused , and I went back and told them he would not do it : G - d d - n you all says he , you want me to stay and be taken ; with that he went down Stairs , with his Irons on , and I have never seen him since Acquitted . 40.

Gainbam . I never did in my Life . I page my Book so , that it can not be altered , and all Marriages are put down Alphabetically , that I can very readily find them . Council . Pray who directed you , to shew that Paper to the Fore-man of the Jury ? Gainham . My own common Judgment , Sir : because I thought I could not be here to Day . Mary Stallwood . I know the Prisoner , he has been very often at my House , and owned Sarah Hussey for his Wife : I have been at her Lyings to , she appeared publickly as his Wife , and he owned her as such . I am Sarah Hussey 's Aunt , and an honest Girl she is . They have lived three Years together : he is a Frame-Guilder , and has been at my House many and many a Time , and supped there , and always owned her for his Wife . Ann Humphries . I know the Prisoner , and the Prisoner knows me , as well as I know him . He and his Wife lived next Door to me . I visited her as a Neighbour , and Mrs. Hussey visited me : They passed for Man and Wife , all over the Street . They lived at Mrs. Whittle 's , in Brownlow-street ; they lived there more than a Year or two , and all the Time no one made any Objections to their being Man and Wife ; I have often been in Company with them ; once I was abroad with them , and they behaved as other Men and their Wives do . Council . Have you never been abroad with a Gentleman that has had a Mistress ? Humphries . I know nothing of them ; but as Man and Wife . Council . Why , you may have seen a Man use his Mistress very kindly . James Whittle . The Prisoner was my Journeyman , and Sarah Hussey lived with him in my House two Years and a half . I was satisfied they were married , else they should not have lived in my House . Q . Did you ever question them about it ? Had you ever any Doubt of it ? Whittle . He was about to leave her , and I perswaded him to stay ; and told him , it was the Part of every honest Man to stay with his Wife and Children ; then he said he was not married . I told him then he should not live in my House ; I would go and see whether he was or not . I went , and this Gentleman ( Dr. Gainham ) remembered the Marriage , and I saw the Register fair and clear ; I came home and told him I had seen the Register , and he said he knew that before I went . I was God-father to his Children , and with his own Mouth , he ordered one of them to be registered . Council . Such Evidence as this , such presumptive Evidence has always been rejected , 'till the Fact be established . Prisoner . I own this last Marriage . Q . Can not a Man come and confess a Felony , and is not his own Confession to bind him ? If a Man confesses himself guilty of Bigamy , shall not that be Evidence ? Council . This is only presumptive Evidence , and the Consequence of admitting it may be dangerous . A Parish Clerk . I was called to two Christenings , at Mr. Whittles ; I do n't know the Man , but I registered two Children in such Names . Mr. Whittle I heard him give Directions , and saw the Clerk take those Directions . John Cook . I went with Mr. Martin , when he took up the Prisoner ; and I asked him how he could be so wicked as to deceive the young Girl ? How he could marry her , having a Wife alive , and this other Woman says she is your Wife ? As to the Wickedness of it , says he , 't is not so wicked as you imagine : I do n't deny but I am married to this Woman , ( Sarah Hussey ) ; but as to the Wickedness of it , you 'll forgive me ; I have had a learned Council 's Opinion of it , a Seajeant at Law , and he says , the Marriage with this Woman , is a very bad one , because I had another at the same Time ; another Wife before this ; I have had Council 's Opinion , says he , and I shall hold the Woman I have married now . We had this Discourse at Sir William Billers 's . Mr. Martin . I know the Prisoner owned the second Marriage . Council . It must be granted me , that here is only circumstantial Proof ; as to the Registring of Children , there is nothing at all in that . But we say , he could not have a Marriage at this Time for at the Time he was married to this Seaton , he had a Wife , and she did not dye , till 6 Months after this pretended Marriage . Court . Our Business is not to annul the Marriage , but to punish . Council . If the first Wife was living , the second Woman could not be a Wife , neither de Jure , nor de Facto . Mary Brothers . I was the Mother of the first Wife ; her Name was Elenor Brothers ; she was married to the Prisoner at St. Martin 's Tabernacle : I saw them married , and her Father gave her away ; she died , March was two Years ago . I do not remember who married them , for I have been out of my Senses since that Time . The 16th Day of September , she was in the 10th Year of her Marriage , and she has been dead above two Years . I think she died in March . Council . And their Marriage was in September 1733 , then she must have been alive at the same Time . Q . Did she live with this Man ? Mrs. Brothers . Yes , 8 Years , but at last they did not agree , and so they parted . I went and carried my Daughter to her , and told her , ( Seaton ) that this was Mr. Hussey 's Wife . This second Marriage broke my poor Daughter 's Heart , and made me run out of my Senses . Council . Did you hear the Prisoner at the Bar was married to this Girl , ( Seaton ) before your Daughter 's Death ? Mrs. Brothers . Yes , yes , this Girl told me she was married to him ; and my Daughter liv 'd 2 Years after that . My Daughter and I went twice to her ; the first Time she did not tell me she was married ; but the second she did , and that she was married at St . Brides . Council . We have prov 'd he was married to these 2 Women , in Court ; now the Proof they would set up , is , that he was married before , and antecedent to each of these Marriages ; that he had a Wife when he married the Woman first mentioned in the indictment , and therefore that this Marriage was void . Council . I did object that here was no positive Evidence of the first Marriage mentioned in the Indictment ; and I do say , I do n't remember any Case , where on this Act of Parliament , circumstantial Proof was ever given in Evidence , without there was some positive Evidence likewise . Q . If the Prisoner confess 'd his Marriage , is that circumstantial Evidence ? Council . I objected it was not sufficient for this Reason : It has been too licentious a Custom for People to live together , who have never been married ; and they call one another my Dear and my Wife , and if you ask whether they are married , yes to be sure , they 'll tell you ; they would not expose , and bring a scandal upon themselves . But on this Act , it being a Felony , what I submit to the Court is , whether there ought not to be some solid Proof in this Case . This was not a Marriage Facie Eclesia , but a Fleet Marriage , and should be prov 'd either by some Body who gave her away , or who saw the Book opened and read , 't is not sufficient I think without some solid Proof of this Kind ; but your Lordship thinks it sufficient Evidence to be left to the Jury . Council . The first Marriage ( in the Indictment ) if it is to be made void , must be annulled by an Ecclesiastical Censure ; this has not been done , it has not been voided by an Ecclesiastical Censure , therefore the Marriage is good . John Johnson . I saw the Prisoner married to Elener Brothers in St. Martin 's Tabernacle , 12 or 13 Years ago . Peter Abel . I know the Prisoner : His Wife Elenor died in the Street in York Buildings , over against the Sun-Tavern . upon a Bench in the Street , I saw her draw her last Breath ; it was in 1734 or 1733-4 . Council . I have one Thing I would just mention ; Gainham said he shew 'd the Certificate of this Marriage to the Fore-man of the Jury beforehand ; I must leave it to the Court whether that should not take off his Testimony .

Thomes Morris , and John Pritchard were indicted for breaking and entering the House of Samuel Allen , about 12 at Night , and stealing thence 3 Porridge Pots , 6 Copper Sauce-pans , 3 Pewter Dishes , a Velvet Cap , and a Peruke , the Goods of Samuel Allen , January 27 . And Mary Eades , for receiving the same , knowing them to be stollen , January 28 . Samuel Allen . I know nothing of the Prisoners . In January my House was robbed ; I was up my self 'till 11 o'Clock , and left my House safe when I went to bed ; in the Morning , a Shutter was taken off , and the Sash which was nailed down , was forced up . I lost 3 Pots , 6 Copper Sauce-pans , 3 Pewter Dishes , a Velvet Cap , and a Peruke . Daniel Shaw . I made my self a voluntary Evidence against the Prisoners , intending to go to Sea , and get away from them . A pretty while after Christmas , Pritchard asked me to take a walk with him , and he and I , and Morris went to Hoxton , about 12 o'Clock at noon ; we viewed Allen 's House , and Pritchard said , this is a proper House , we can get in here . Then we went to the Farthing Pye-house , and drank two Full Pots ; about 11 o'Clock at night we went to Allen 's again , and staid about the House 'till 12 . We found the Doors lock 'd and fast , but with a ripping Chissel and a Knife , I made way to open the Pin of the Window ; then we wrenched the Shutter down , and finding the Sashes nailed , I forced one of them up my self . Then says Pritchard , D - n me , who will go in ; one was afraid , and t'other was afraid ; keep a good look out , says I , and I will go in : They said , if any body came by , they would cry , Hyp . I got in , and unbolted the Door , then I handed out three Porridge Pots , one of them had three Feet on the bottom ; six Sauce-pans , they were Copper , I believe , and as soon as we had got them , we carried them to the Prisoner Eades , three Pewter Dishes , a Velvet Cap , and a Natural Wig ; we put them into a Flower-bag , and thinking we heard a Noise , we got out , and went off . I put the Cap and Wig in my Pocket ; Pritchard and Morris put the rest of the Things into the Bag , as I handed them out . Then we made the best of our way , and took spell and spell , turn and turn to carry them to Rag-Fair , and we got there between two and three ; from thence we went to Salt-Peter Bank , to a Glass-house , which is tumbled down , and we hid the Things under the Rubbish , and stow 'd Bricks upon them . Happening to see Mary Eades there , ( for 't is a common Place for such People ) she told us , she knew a Place where they bought such Things . I asked her , if she would sell them for us , and told her , we had stole them ; she said , she knew a Case , where she could dispose of such Things ; so I gave her the three Porridge-pots , and the six Sauce-pans , to another Woman who was with her . They went away together , and came back for the Dishes ; we gave them the Dishes directly , and then they went away , and brought us 25 s. G - d d - m your Blood , you B - ch , says , Pritchard to Eades , have you brought us no more ? she said , no , she could not get any more . About two o'Clock that Afternoon , I sold the Wig , and the Cap for half a Crown each , which made just 30 s. together , and Eades had 4 s. for her Trouble ; 2 s. we spent upon her , and divided 8 s. a piece . The 2 s. we spent at an Irish Man 's at Salt-Peter Bank , at the Sign of the Hoop : After this , I did not see them for a matter of four Months . Eades . Daniel Shaw , Can you say I received the 4 s. from you ? Shaw . She kept 4 s. out of the Money . She said , she had sold the Pots to one in Bishop 's Gate street ; I sent Word to the Prosecutor , but there was no such Person to be found . Eades . Who was the other Woman that was with me ? Shaw . Phoenix , was with you . Robert Clark . I was at Justice Farmer 's to have a Warrant discharged ; and while I was there , Shaw came voluntarily , and made this Information : I staid while he made it , and by his Direction we took the three Prisoners . Morris . I can prove where I was when the Robbery was done . Pritchard . I am as innocent as the Child in its Mother 's Womb . Eades . Shaw quarrelled with me about fetching a Hat out of pawn , and because I would not , he has made himself a Puff . I was drinking a Dram , and he came with these Gentlemen , and said , these are your Prisoners ; I said , Daniel , you know Phaenix has got the Hat : I shewed her where to pawn it ; and he gave me a Quartern of Gin , and told me he stole it from a Man , in the first Field in Stepney . John Turner . Morris came to work with me ( a Sawyer ) March 27 , and staid 7 or 8 Days ; during which Time he behaved well . Thomas Wisdom , gave the same Evidence . Several others appeared to Morris 's Character , who had not heard ill of him before . Guilty , Morris and Pritchard . Death .
