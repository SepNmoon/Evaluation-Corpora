Collumb Connel , of St Stephen Coleman-Street , was indicted for stealing a King Charles 's Medal , value 4 s. a Silk Purse , work 'd with Silver , val.6 d. a Silk Handkerchief , val.18 d. the Goods of Thoresby Cotton , May 31 . Mr. Cotton . The Prisoner robbed me of several Things , at the late Fire in Swan Alley in Coleman-Street . He is a Watchman , and came to assist me , I ordered him to carry nothing away , 'till I saw immediate Danger , and gave Directions for so doing . When the Fire was over , I miss 'd a Silk Purse , a Silk Handkerchief , and a Silver Medal , - a King Charles 's Medal I take it to be . The Night after the Fire , it was my Watch night , ( I being a Constable ) and about 12 at Night , the Purse and the Handkerchief were found on the Floor , in our Watch-house . I knew them to be mine , and suspecting the Prisoner to have dropped them , I took a Watchman with me , and went to the Prisoner 's Stand ; where I told him he must go with me to his own House , When we came there , I asked him if he knew any thing of the Purse and the Handkerchief ? At first he told me No ; but afterwards he confessed he took the Things out of my House , in the Extremity I was under , during the Fire , and own 'd he had pawned the Medal for 4 s. at a Pawnbroker 's in Grub-street . He went with me thither , and I had it again , upon paying Four Shillings and Three-half-pence . I had many other Things lost and destroy 'd at that Time , which are not in the Indictment , and which I have heard nothing of . William Gwynn . Mr. Cotton came to my Stand in a great Passion , and told me he suspected that Villain ( the Prisoner ) to have robbed him , for he had come to the Knowledge of a Purse , which had some Things in it , and no one had been at his House but the Prisoner . I advised him to carry him home from his Stand , to his ( the Prisoner 's ) House . He did so ; and upon his being asked about the Goods , he deny 'd his knowing any thing of them , with Oaths and Imprecations ; but Mr Cotton shewed him the Purse which was found in the Watch-house , and told him , if he would confess where all the Things were , he would only turn him out of the Watch-house for his Punishment . He then own 'd he had dropped the Purse and the Handkerchief in the Watch-house . The next Morning Mr Cotton came to me , and told me , he missed other Things , and that the Prisoner had undone him , by destroying some Writings . Upon this we went to him again , and he own 'd he had pawn 'd the Medal , and carried us to the Pawnbroker 's , where it was found , and Mr Cotton shewed it to the Prisoner , who own 'd it to be the same he had pawn 'd . It was a Medal of the same Stamp with this now produced , and I believe it to be the same . Prisoner . I have nothing to say for myself but this . There was a Fire happened near Mr Cotton 's , and I went to his House to assist him . Some of his Goods were pack 'd up , and some were not . He and his Wife were in a great Flurry , and she desired me to help her ; So I pack 'd up 4 or 5 Beds , and put them into the Kitchen ; but the Purse , the Medal , and the Handkerchief I put into my Pocket : and after the Fire was over Mrs Cotton gave me a Dram - I believe I drank 3 or 4 , because I was in a great Sweat . Afterwards I pawn 'd this Medal , for want of Money ; but how much I had upon it I ca n't tell - I thought I had had but a Shilling , if I had more , I do n't know what became of the rest of the Money . No body can say any thing else against me , and for this , I lie at the Mercy of the Court . Mr Cotton . My Goods were brought down into the Kitchen : and as I am a Constable , and Sir Harcourt Masters 's Beadle , I did Duty at the Fire , and ordered the Prisoner , not to carry any thing away from my House , 'till I gave him Directions . I bid him pack up the Goods , but not remove them 'till I saw there was Occasion ; and he being one of our Watchmen , I thought I could confide in him . William Negus deposed , That the Prisoner confessed he had the Purse and the Handkerchief in his Possession ; that there was some Writings in the Purse , and that he put them into his Pocket when he was packing up Mr Cotton 's Goods . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 285.+ Samuel Badham , of St Giles in the Fields , was indicted for that he not having the Fear of God before his Eyes , & c . May.20 , in and upon Susannah , the Wife of Simon Hart , feloniously , & c . did make an Assault , and both his Hands in and upon the Throat of the said Susannah , did fix , and fasten ; and with both his Hands , so fix 'd and fasten 'd , the Throat of the said Susannah did squeeze , and press , by reason of which squeezing and pressing , the said Susannah was choaked and strangled ; of which choaking and strangling she instantly died . He was a second Time indicted by Virtue of the Coroner 's Inquest for the wilful Murder of the said Susannah . Arabella Clark . I saw the deceas 'd on Tuesday Morning , between 10 and 11 o'Clock , ( I ca n't tell the Day of the Month ) but she was alive and well , to my thinking . She spoke to me , and I thought her not to be at all in Liquor . In the Afternoon ( of the same Day ) between 2 and 3 o'Clock , I heard she was dead , and laid out . I saw her on the Thursday following ; she had a black place on her Throat , and another on her left Temple , like a very bad Bruise . William Cock . I know nothing of the Murder , I only helped to carry the Corps of the deceas 'd about a dozen or 14 Yards . Paul Lewis . I was employed by the Church-Wardens of St Giles 's , as a Surgeon , to open the Body of the deceas 'd . I found the Woman bruised all over . Her Head , Face , Hands , Back , - she was all over bruised . There was one very remarkable Bruise on her Throat . The Mark on the right Side , resembled a Man 's Hand , - or Fingers ; that on the left side was not so large , and was like the Print of a Thumb , and this seemed to be the Death of the Woman . I looked at these Marks , and take them to have been made by a Thumb on one side , and Fingers on the other , and that they were the Cause of her Death . One Symptom which corroborates my Opinion , is , that the Vessels seemed to have been full , and turgid ; tho ' that is not an absolute Symptom , for in Apoplexies they will be the same : but this , with the Bruises on the Throat , strengthens my Opinion ( I think ) very much . Ann Collins . The Prisoner liv 'd in the House of one Richard Booker , up 2 pair of Stairs , and I lodged up one Pair in the same House . Between 10 and 11 o'Clock in the Forenoon , one Tuesday in May , ( but I ca n't tell the Day of the Month ) I was in my own Room , and the deceas 'd came into the House . I desired ( Booker ) the Landlord , to tell her I wanted to speak with her . She sent me Word , she was afraid to come up Stairs , for Fear of the Prisoner ; but she sent me up a bit of Veal and Pork , for my Child . In about a quarter of an Hour , I heard her go up Stairs with the Landlord ; he came down again directly , and in two Minutes after she had got up Stairs , I heard her cry out , Murder ! and presently she cried out again , - Murder ! Murder ! - the Rogue will murder me ! I called out to the Prisoner , and he called me Bitch , and bid me mind my own pocky , itchy Child . The deceased called out for Booker , and cried , Murder ! Booker ! Booker ! the Rogue will murder me ! And I heard three or four Blows which sounded loud into my Room ; I ca n't tell whether they were given with his Hand , or what else , - they sounded like Blows with a Stick . After she had cried out three or four Times , I went out with my Child ; not thinking she was murdered , because they often quarreled ; and when I came home between 5 and 6 o'Clock , the Prisoner said to me , The Woman is dead , - sure enough ! - What Woman , said I ? my Wife , said he : - Then , you Rogue , you have murdered her.- You had best take care what you say , for ( says he ) I will lay you in Prison . The deceas 'd was not the Prisoner 's Wife , but she went for such , - at that Time . I saw her Body after she was dead ; there were several Marks upon her ; and one round her Throat . I saw them the day after she died . Eliz Macdonald . I ca n't say I saw any beating ; but she shew 'd me some Blacks and some Blues about a Month before she died , and she told me they were given her by the Prisoner . Anne Allen . I saw her black Marks about her Throat , after she was dead , - that 's all . Richard Booker . I ca n't tell the Day of the Month ; but I saw the Deceased when she came in on the Tuesday . 'T was about 10 o'Clock , and she was as well then as any Woman , - what happen 'd afterwards , - I ca n't tell . She was deadly fuddl 'd , and I help 'd her up Stairs because she was fuddl 'd , but I did not see her into her Room : I help 'd her up within 4 or 5 steps of her Chamber , and then she went up the rest herself.- I ca n't tell whether the Prisoner was in her Company afterwards.- She was alive some Hours after this , - before he kill 'd her , - but I know nothing about it , - no I know nothing of it , I heard no Outcry , for I went out directly ; to get half a Gill of Wine for my Wife who was very ill. Kimbrow Murphey . I live in the next House to Booker 's , and as they tell me , the Deceased 's Room was next to the Side of mine . I heard a Woman 's Voice cry out Murder , more than once or twice . This was about the Hour of 11 , to the best of my Knowledge . I ca n't swear whether it was He or She ; but it was on the Day she died.- I ca n't justly tell the Day of the Month , for I did not keep it in my Memory . Margaret Wood . I heard the Woman cry Murder several Times , very low , and it was the Deceased 's Voice . I went twice or thrice into the House that Afternoon , but I saw no Disaster , nor heard of any , till about 5 o'Clock ; then a Woman told me she ( the Deceas 'd ) was dead . I said , - if she was dead , I was sure she had been murdered , and I went immediately to the House , and met the Prisoner upon the Stairs ; I asked the People why they did not stop him ? and they replied , - why did not you stop him ? When I came up into the Room , I saw her lie in her Bed : she was dead , and had a Blemish on her left Temple . To be sure she was murdered by some body ; for I heard her cry out Murder , and for certain he must be in the Room , because I met him upon the Stairs about Five . Martha Hough . On the Day the Deceased died , I saw her go by , about 11 o'Clock , very sober , and very well . Between one and two I heard she was dead . Mary Bates . About 11 o'Clock I heard the Cry of Murder , and knew her Voice : My Mother 's House joins to theirs , and I was in the Entry at the same Time . While she was crying Murder , I heard the Prisoner call her ugly Names , Whore , and Bitch , a great many Times , but I did not see him that Afternoon . I was acquainted with the Prisoner , no farther than by his lodging in the Neighbourhood , but I am sure it was his Voice , and am positive to both their Voices , and that she cried out Murder 5 or 6 Times , but I heard no Blows given . This was on Tuesday about 11 o'Clock . In the Afternoon I saw the deceased , and observed a Bruise on her left Temple . DEFENCE . Booker told me , that this Susan Hart fell down a Step in the long Entry ; that he took her up , and she afterwards went into the Room where he and his Wife lay , and there they drank Liquors together an Hour and half . After this , Booker brought her up Stairs : I was a-bed and asleep , and Booker took me by the Shoulder , and wak 'd me . Then I saw her so much in Liquor that she could not undress herself , so I got up and pull 'd off her Cloaths , and got her in bed . After which I call 'd to Booker for some Liquors ; he brought some up ; we drank them , and then I spy 'd she was dead . Booker . The Woman did not fall down the Step , nor did I go into his Room and wake him . I saw him awake , and he took her into the Room , when I carried her up , but I did not then go into the Room , but went out for the Wine , and staid about a Quarter of an Hour . When I came back , I heard no Noise . Prisoner . Ask Booker if he was not in my Room ? Booker . About a Quarter of an Hour after I had helped her up Stairs , I went into their Room , and saw her with the Prisoner , very well ; then I went out again , and was out about a Quarter of an Hour . Prisoner . Did not you bring up Liquor after she was in the Room ? Booker . No , I carried up nothing . Prisoner . He brought up Liquor , and because I had no Money , he had a Pair of Grey Stockings for it . Ann Collins . This Booker did carry up Liquor : I saw him go by my Door with a Half-pint Pot , but I do n't know what was in it . Booker . Yes , I did carry up 3 Half-quarterns of Gin , after I had carried her up Stairs , but I drank none of it . Prisoner . Collins made oath before Mr De Veil , that she ( the Deceased ) had been drinking an hour , or an hour and half , before Booker brought her up to me . Collins . She was not in Liquor to my thinking , when she went up Stairs : nor did I declare before Colonel De Veil , that she had been drinking an Hour and half before . I did not see her drink any thing , and I believe she was not in Liquor . Guilty . Death . 286+ Christian Watkins was indicted for stealing a plain Gold Ring , val.10 s , the Goods of William Soame , in his Shop , in the Parish of St Peter 's Cheap , May 26 . Robert Peers . I live with Mr Soame , a Goldsmith , in Cheapside . The Prisoner , with another Woman , came into my Master 's Shop , the 26th of May , about 9 o'clock in the Morning , to buy a Gold Ring . I put about 3 or 4 upon the Counter , that she might fit herself . None of them would do , so I took them up , and put them into the Glass , to take out more ; but before I shut the Glass , the Prisoner put her Hand in , and took out one of those Rings which I had before shewn her , and put it on her middle Finger . Then she put her Finger into her Mouth , and pulled the Ring off in her Mouth , and gave me this brass Ring instead of it . As soon as she gave it me , I told her it was not the same Ring she had put on her Finger . She said it was . I said it was larger than what she had taken , for the Gold Ring was very tight on her Finger , and the Brass one went on and off very easy . She insisted upon it , that 't was the same , and I could not get the Gold Ring again ; so I called my Master , and he tryed the Brass Ring on her Finger , and told her , she had no need to wet her Finger in her Mouth to get that Ring off . She said , her Hand was hot when she came in , but now it was cold , which was the Reason it went on easier than before . Then my Master sent me for a Constable , and while I was gone , either she or her Companion dropp 'd 3 or 4 brass Rings in the Shop , and when we searched her , ( at a Publick House in Milk-Street ) there was no more than 6 d. found upon the Prisoner , nor could we find the Ring upon either of them , as I was informed by the People , who searched them . Defence . I was seatched at the Gentleman 's House , and the young Woman who was with me , was searched there too . They found nothing up on us , but because some brass Rings had been dropped in the Shop , they charged us with this Thing , when perhaps it might be some other Person who dropped them . Mr Peers . I know nothing of their being searched at our House . Guilty * 4 s.6 d. * The Ring not being produced , nor the Value proved , the Jury might fix what Value they thought proper . The following Case differs in both those Circumstances . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 287+ Elizabeth Davis , of Allhallows the Great , was indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , val.6 l.2 Silver Salvers , val.8 l. a Silver Mug , val.30 s.4 Silver Spoons , val.30 s.3 Silver Tea Spoons , val.3 s. a Silver Pepper Box , val.8 s . a Pair of Woman 's Shoes laced , val.2 s.6 d. a Holland Shirt , val.5 s. Half a Yard of Damask , val.2 s.6 d and a Cambrick Apron , val.5 s. the Goods of Paul Brown , in his Dwelling House , June 14 . Mr Brown . The Prisoner was my Servant , and on the 14th of last Month , between 2 and 3 in the Morning she went away , and took the Plate , and Wearing Apparel out of my Dwelling-House . ( The Prisoner mentioned the Particulars in the Indictment . ) I keep a Tavern ; the Prisoner lived with me as a Cook , and I missed the Goods out of my Bar . I had had Company in my House till 2 that Morning , and at 12 I bid her go to Bed . At 2 l went to Bed myself , after I had fastened the Door and Bars , and had seen all the Candles out . About 6 in the Morning , my Boy came up for the Key of the Vault , and asked if his Mistress had given the Maid leave to go out ? She came down Stairs and found the Goods gone : Upon which I got up , and immediately took proper Methods to detect the Prisoner . I went to the Goldsmiths Company , and got Advertisements delivered to the Trade : and after I had taken all the Care that was necessary , Business calling , I went to Greenwich , and was fetch 'd from thence by one of my Neighbours , who informed me the Prisoner was taken . As soon as I came to her , she made a Confession , and gave me the Half-pint Mug out of her Pocket , telling me where the rest of my Goods were , and the different Pawnbrokers where they were pledged . The large Salver was stopped , Mr Chambers has it now in Court , and it is mine . This 2 Quart Tankard she delivered to me herself out of her Box , and this Wearing Apparel , which I did not miss , 'till I saw it in her Box . This Salver she pawn 'd for a Guinea and a Half and there 's the Pawnbroker 's Mark upon it , which he will swear to . The second Time I went to her , I told her she had not given me all the Things I had lost , and then she gave me another of the small Spoons . William Chambers . This Salver was offered to me , by the Prisoner ; but I not liking the Account she gave me of herself , I stopped it : upon which she told me she would fetch her Mother , and so went away . The next Day I saw the Advertisement , and gave Mr Brown Notice of the Salver : He came , and I produced this Salver before Colonel De Veil , and he owned it . Mr Brown . This Salver is mine . Chambers . She wanted to borrow 6l . upon it ; it was worth something more . I am positive the Prisoner was the Person who brought it to me , on the 14th of June . Walter Creedon , ( a Drummer . ) On Saturday the 14th of June , I was at Work till late at Night , and then went to an Alehouse in Drury-Lane , to get 6 Pence of a Man who owed it me . When I came there he told me , he could have paid me , if I had come in the Morning , for he could have got something from a Woman , who had been there , and had committed a Robbery in Thames-Street . I thought proper to enquire after this Woman , and got Intelligence where she lodged . I went into the House and enquired for the Woman who had brought in a Box ; but I was informed she was gone out . I told the People , that she was a Serjeant 's Wife in our Company , and that I was sent by her Husband to bring her Home , for she had taken away her Husband 's Things . I bid a Man who was with me sit down , while I went into Thames-Street , to give Mr Brown notice . Mr Brown was out of Town ; but a Neighbour of his came up with me , to swear to the Prisoner , and we all sat together till 12 o'Clock ; and then she came in with a Watchman , who lit her Home . As soon as she got in , I laid my Hand upon her Shoulder , and charged her with a Robbery committed in Thames-Street . I asked her if the Goods in her Box were her own ? She said yes : but I desired this Gentleman , ( Mr Tarp , ) who came from Thames-Street with me , to assist the Watchman , while I fetched another : and then we carried her to the Round-House . She said the Box was her 's ; the Silver laced Shoes , some Linnen , and the silver Tankard were in it , which she said were her own . There was 5 Guineas Reward offered in the Advertisement , for taking the Prisoner ; I was the first Man that laid hold of her , and I asked my Colonel leave to come from the Camp , about the five Guineas . John Tarp . This Man , Creedon , ( the Drummer ) came to see for Mr Brown , but he being gone to Greenwich , I was desired to go with the Witness . He carried me to a House , in Thomas-street , where I found his Comrade waiting , and looking after the Box till we came . The Prisoner came in between twelve and one , in a hurry , and said she had like to have been knocked down in the Street . I said to her , Cousin ! How do you do ? Cousin , says she , I do n't know you ! That 's very likely , says I , but do you know this Box ? Yes , says she , why then you and I must be better acquainted ; and so I bid the Watchman fetch a Constable . He refus 'd , and asked me why I charged the Woman ? I told him , I charged her for robbing her Master ; then ( says he ) I charge you to assist . Upon this I bid the Drummer go and fetch a Constable , and I held his Sword while he was gone . When he came back , he told us the Constable ordered her to be brought to him . Then ( says I ) take one of you the Box on your Head ; and do you take hold of the Woman ; and I 'll take the Lanthorn and follow , to see that she drops nothing ; so we carried her and the Box to the Watch-house , where she refused to open it ; but upon the Constable 's telling her he would break it open , she gave him the Keys , and the first thing I saw was this Tankard . I knew it , for I have drank out of it several Times and upon a farther search into it , we found Mrs Brown 's Shoes , Stockings , Aprons , and several Things . I know the Tankard to be Mr Brown 's . Mr Allen . On Saturday Morning , the 14th of June , the Prisoner came to my Shop with a Salver . I looked at it , and asked her whose it was ? She told me it was her Mother 's and that she knew of her bringing it . What is your Mother 's Name ? Mary Davis . What is your Name ? the same . Where does your Mother live ? In Gracechurch Street . Then I asked her what she wanted upon the Salver ? She told me , - a Guinea and a half , which I lent her upon it , and she went away . But as soon as I saw the Advertisement , I carried the Salver to Mr Brown 's House , and gave it his Wife . This is the Salver I took in from the Prisoner . Mr Brown . This is one that I miss 'd . The Prisoner in her Defence , pleaded that her Master was very fond of her , and bid her not mind her Mistress , who was jealous of the Intimacy between them . And after she had told a long Story to this Purpose , ( no Part of which , she could prove by any Witness , she insisted upon it , that her Master ordered her to pack up the Plate and go over with it to France ; that accordingly she carried off the Goods , but her Mind altering , and she not being willing to go to France , pawned the Goods , that he might have the Trouble of redeeming them for his Pains ; and that she intended to have sent her Mistress Word where the Goods were pledged . Mr Tarp in Contradiction to this Story deposed , that Mr Brown complained to him the same Morning the Robbery was committed , about 7 o'Clock , that the Prisoner was run away , and had robbed him of his Plate . Mr Brown farther deposed , that he had heard of this Story the Prisoner had raised ; upon which he took Mr Tarp with him to Newgate , and taxed her with being the Author of this Report : and she then declared , that whatever she might have said of this kind , was false and groundless . Mr Tarp confirmed Mr Brown 's Evidence , in this Respect . The Prisoner denied she had seen either Mr Tarp or Mr Brown while she was in Newgate , but they both proved to the contrary ; and both deposed , that when they saw her there , she had pawned an Apron for Garnish-Money , which Apron proved to be her Mistress 's , and Mr Brown paid three Shillings for it . The Prisoner owned she had pawned the Apron , and said her Master paid but a Shilling to redeem it . Mr Brown added , that after the Prisoner was in Custody , she wrote him a Letter , informing him where she had pawned a laced Cap and a Hood , which were not missed , till that Information was received , but were then found according to her Directions . My Plate was worth 30 l. I could not replace it for 35 l. Guilty 39s . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 288,289,290.+ James Haughton , Eleanor Haughton his Wife , alias Eleanor Haughton , Spinster , and Elizabeth Jemmet , of St Paul Shadwell , were indicted for privately stealing a silver Watch , val.3 l.4 Guineas , and 2 Half-guineas from the Person of , March 5 . The Counsel having opened the Charge , the Witnesses were called . Prosecutor . On Saturday Morning the 23d of February , I came from London , - I lay at a Friend 's House on Friday Night , and next Morning walked as far as Haughton 's House . I believe it was about 10 o'Clock in the Morning when I went in . I drank 2 or 3 Pints of Two-penny , and smoaked a Pipe or 2 of Tobacco , and not having eaten any thing , the Beer began to 'toxicate my Head . Upon that they asked me to go up Stairs , and when I was got up Stairs , they asked me what I would drink ? I said , I did not care what . So they brought up Liquor called Bembow , and they supplied me with that , pretty much , whereof I staid there all Saturday , and all Saturday Night . I can not say I was thoroughly disguised , but I was the worse for drinking , so I sat up all Saturday Night a drinking with them . I was drinking with them , from Saturday Morning to Sunday Morning , and the Prisoner Haughton , his Wife , and Elizabeth Jemmet were in my Company ; Haughton 's Wife supplied us with Liquor , - that great Woman in the middle there , - and there was another Woman with us , - one Susan Archer , but she is not here . I drank plentifully , and after I had drank plentifully , I began to be drousy , and being drousy on Sunday Evening I staid all that Night , - I staid till Monday . I began to be drousy on Sunday Night , and fell asleep in the Chamber , in my Chair , - I did not go to Bed , and so I saw Mrs Haughton give something to her Husband when I awaked , - but what it was , I can not say . A little after that , I put my Hand in my Pocket and examined my Purse , whereof I found nothing at all in it . I had seen my Purse in Eleanor Haughton 's Hand , and asked what Business she had with my Purse ? She said nothing , but delivered it to me again , and I put it into my Pocket , without looking to see whether it was gutted or no . Couns . Between the Time you put the Purse in your Pocket , after you had received it from Haughton , and your examining it , could any one else have taken it out of your Pocket ? Prosecutor . No . No body came between us , from the Time she delivered it to me , and my finding nothing in it , - but Jemmet . Couns . How much Money was in your Purse ? Prosecutor . Four Guineas,2 Half Guineas , and a Shilling ; but when I took out my Purse , the Money was - all gone . I asked Ellen Haughton about it ; she said , she took nothing out , - they all denied taking the Money out . I told them I had so much Money in it , and would have it again : upon which they every one of them bid me not make a Noise , and I should have my Money again . Then Jemmet came up to me , and said , come , if you will go along with me , you shall go up with me into my Chamber . Accordingly I went with her , and with that she brought up a Quartern of Brandy , which we drank ; and with that I began to be drousy again . Couns . When was this ? Prosecutor . This was on the Saturday Night . Couns . And after you had drunk the Brandy what then ? Prosecutor . Then I was drousy again , and then I missed my Watch . There was no body with me , when I drank the Brandy , but Jemmet ; and when I wak 'd , I missed my Watch , there was no body in the Room with me but Jemmet . Couns . And what did you do upon this ? Prosecutor . I asked her where my Watch was : She said she had carried it down to James Haughton , without giving me any Reason for it . I am sure I had it in my Pocket , when I went to sleep in Jemmet 's , Room . I asked her what Business she had to meddle with my Watch ? She told me , it was to let Mr Haughton see what it was o'clock . I bid her fetch it me again ; and she went down Stairs , but instead of That , she brought up another Quartern of Brandy , and then the Watch went out of my Head . After this , I sat a drinking , and asked after my Watch ; and I asked Mrs Haughton , what was to pay ? I had paid 2 or 3 Reckonings before , - I believe I had paid to the Value of 23s.6d . Couns . When was it you asked Mrs Haughton what was to pay ? And what Answer did she make you ? Prosecutor . I asked her what was to pay for the new Reckoning on Monday Morning , and she told me , - nothing at all . Indeed I had nothing to pay , for they had got all my Money . When I felt in my Pocket , and found all my Money gone , I told them 't was very hard to be served in this kind . Couns . Did you tell them what Money was in the Purse ? Prosecutor . Yes . I told Mrs Haughton , but she said nothing at all to it . Couns . You say you told her how much Money was in the Purse ? Prosecutor . Yes ; She told me she took it for the Reckoning . She did not deny that she took it , but said she took it for the Reckoning . I told her it was impossible that I could drink so much Liquor as came to all this Money , - for there was 4 Guineas , and 2 Half-Guineas in the Purse , but they told me I had had it all in Liquor . Couns . What 5 Pounds 6 Shillings-worth of Liquor ? Prosecutor . Yes ; they told me I had had so much.- and more . Couns . Pray had you any Eatables ? Prosecutor . No , - none at all ; - nothing at all , - nothing but Brandy and Bembow ; and there was only I , and the 3 Prisoners , and one more . James Haughton . Please to ask him how long I was in Company with him , and when I parted with him . Prosecutor . He was there on Saturday till 6 o'clock ; and then he was in Company on Sunday , and on Sunday Evening . On Saturday he was in Company from 10 to 6 , and all Sunday - I ca n't say directly all Sunday , but he was there a pretty while on Sunday Evening . J. Haughton . Where was I in Company with you ? Prosecutor . At the Kitchen Fire , and likewise up Stairs on Sunday Afternoon , and in the Evening . E. Haughton . Was you in our House , or Jemmet 's all this Time ? Prosecutor . At your House - She 's a wicked Hussey , -'tis a wicked House . E. Haughton . Then how came you to come into it ? Where did you lie on Sunday Night ? Prosecutor . At Jemmet 's House . Jemmet lives at next Door , and is one of their Plyers . E. Haughton . Did you see my Husband , when you went from my House on Sunday Morning , at 11 o'clock ? Prosecutor . I did not go from your House then . I went from your House on Monday Morning . E. Haughton . Did not you lie at my House on Monday Night ? Prosecutor . No ; I went away on Monday Morning . E. Haughton . Where did you go when you left my House ? Prosecutor . I went to Stepney , to the Sign of the Rose , ( a Publick House , ) on Monday , - no , - that was not the first House , - the first House I went to was the Green Dragon , at Stepney , that was in the Morning ; the last House I was at was the Rose at Stepney ; I went thither about 10 o ' clock at Night . J. Haughton . Did you make any Complaint at Stepney , of your having been robbed ? Prosecutor . No ; What Occasion had I to tell them of it ? Two or 3 Days after I had got home , I said I had been robbed . J. Haughton . When did you get out a Warrant to take us ? Prosecutor . I ca n't tell the Day , - I believe it was about 3 Weeks afterwards : and then they were not taken up , for Justice Jones took Bail for them . J. Haughton . After you went from our House , did not you lie at the Rose at Stepney , and was not you asked when you went to Bed there , whether you had a Watch , or any Money ? Prosecutor . Nobody asked me the Question ; for I drank a Pint or 2 of Beer , and paid my Reckoning there , so they had no Occasion to ask me what Money I had in my Pocket . E. Haughton . Ask him if he did not borrow 3 Shillings of me when he went away , because he had a dirty Shirt on , and did not care to go home 'till it was dark ? Prosecutor . I did borrow 2 or 3 Shillings of them . E. Haughton . Did you not go out on Sunday Morning , before Mr Haughton was got up ? Prosecutor . I did not go out at all . I staid there all the Evening , and was not a-bed all the Time I was there.- I believe it might be about 10 o'clock at Night , when I went to Jemmet's.- I did go there , and I lay there that Night , and returned to Haughton 's House next Morning ( Monday ) . Jemmet . Did not you tell Haughton that you had pawn 'd your Watch for 2 Guineas ? Prosecutor . No : Jemmet took it out of my Pocket , at her House , about 10 o'Clock at Night , as nigh as I can guess . Haughtons . Did not we tell you we would lend you Money to give her , that you might have it again , and did we not lend you Money for a Coach to go home ? Prosecutor . No , - no such Thing : -'tis a notorious House . Haughtons . How long did you stay out upon the Ramble , before you went home ? Prosecutor . I staid out a Week , - I am sure I lost the Money in Haughton 's House . I saw it in my Purse about 12 o'Clock on Sunday Noon , and missed it about 9 at Night . I had some Silver in my Pocket , besides the Gold , when I first went into their House , but that I paid them for Reckonings . I lay at Jemmet 's on Sunday Night , but I missed my Money before I went there . W - F - . There or 4 Days after the Prosecutor had been at Haughton 's House , he complained to me , that he had been robbed , and had lost his Money there ; 4 Guineas , and 2 Half-Guineas . He told me , that Haughton and his Wife took the Money , and another Woman afterwards took his Watch from him . At his Desire , I went to Haughton 's House , and found them both sitting by the Fire . How came you to be so wicked says I ) to serve my Friend so ? - To let him spend all his Money , and then take 4 Guineas , and 2 Half-Guineas from him ? Says Ellen Haughton , I took his Purse and Money . What did you take it for ? Why , ( says she ) to pay what he ow 'd , and his Reckonings . Then presently she said , - No , I gave a Guinea to one Woman , and a Guinea to another . Yes , says James Haughton , my Wife had the Money , and she gave it me to pay Reckoning : She gave ( said he ) one Guinea to one Woman ; another to another Woman , and the rest she kept for the Reckoning . She did not say from whence she took the Money , but she own 'd she had it ; that she took it from him , and gave him the Purse again . She likewise owned that she had given Jemmet one Guinea , and Susan Archer another ; and she said farther , - D - mn him , if he had had 20l . in his Pocket , she would have taken it all , for he would be ashamed to prosecute . Couns . Did she declare in what Condition the Prosecutor was , when she took the Money ? F - . She said he was between sleeping and waking , when she took the Money out of the Purse , for he had been drinking a great deal of Bembow , and was drowsy ; and that he happen 'd to see the Purse in her Hand , and asked her what Business she had with it , upon which she said nothing , but gave him his Purse again , and he put it up into his Pocket , after she had taken the Money out of it ; and when he called for the Reckoning , she said , she told him he had nothing to pay . Why then , says I , if you had got his Money , and he had nothing to pay , what did you take his Watch for ? It was not I , ( said she ) who took his Watch from him , - it was Jemmet , for he was up with her in her Chamber . I never spoke to Jemmet about it , but the Haughtons told me , she came down to them with the Watch in her Hand , and shewed them what it was o'Clock : that she fetched 2 or 3 Quarterns of Brandy , and then went away with the Watch . Jemmet . Ask the Prosecutor if he did not leave the Watch with me for the Reckoning ; for he was at my House 2 Days and a Night , - from Sunday Morning eleven o'Clock , till Monday Night about six . Prosecutor . I was there from Sunday between 10 and 11 at Night , till Monday Morning about 8 , and then I went away to the Green Dragon at Stepney . I did not leave the Watch with her for the Reckoning , she took it . Jemmet . Did you pay me any thing ? Prosecutor . She belongs to Haughton ; she was a Tender there , and brought up most of the Liquors in Haughton 's House . She is a 'Tender there , and a wicked Gang it is.- No , I paid her nothing . Jemmet . Did not I come with another Person,3 Weeks after , to your House , and ask you whether you would redeem the Watch ; and did not you say , you had ordered Mr F - to bring me the Money , and redeem it ? Prosecutor . She did come , I believe , about the Time she speaks of ; but I told her , I owed her no Money , nor any Money would I pay her ; nor did she say any thing about redeeming the Watch . There was a Man with her , - one of their Gang , who would swear a Cow is a Horse , for 't is a notorions Gang - I did not say , I had ordered Mr F - to pay her any Money for the Watch , - I said no such Thing . Jemmet . He ask me , ( when I went to him about it ) how much the Watch lay for ? I told him -3 l. odd Money . I 'll give you two Guineas , ( says he ) and if you will not let me have it , I 'll swear a Robbery ; against you . Prosecutor 'T is all false . Mr F - . Mrs Haughton told me the Watch was pawned for 50 s. That 's false says I , for no Pawnbroker will lend above 2 Guineas upon it She told me , I had Money enough , and if I would let her have 2 Guineas I should have it again : but I told her I would not be concerned in compounding a Felony . They made their Brags , that the Great Miller had been with them , and that they had got his Money and Watch . Ann Draper . I happened to be at Haughton 's House , and she desired me to go to Mr F - 's , and tell him , if he would send 2 Guineas , his Friend 's Watch should be redeemed . I went to him with this Message , and the same Day , and he told me he would not redeem it , - he would not do any such thing . E. Haughton . Please to ask her , what brought her to my House that Day ? Draper . Indeed I ca n't justly tell.- I go out a Washing and Scowring , and Mrs Haughton knew I used Mr F - 's House . James Haughton in his Defence said , the Prosecutor came into his House on Saturday Morning , and called for a Pint of Two-penny ; that he drank part of 6 or 7 Pints with him , and about 2 o'Clock went out to Limehouse , and did not come home till 12 ; that he then went to Bed , and saw no more of the Prosecutor till Monday Evening,6 o'Clock ; and then he told him he had left his Watch as a Pawn , for 3l . odd Money , at Mrs Jemmet 's , and desired him to lend him Money to redeem it because he thought it was not safe with her . That he refused to lend him so much Money , but offered to lend him Money to pay for a Coach , if he would go home . That when he went away he borrowed 2 or 3 Shillings to go to Stepney with , because he was too dirty to go home by Day-light . That he continued at Stepney 7 or 8 Days , and made no Complaint of this Robbery , & c . Elizabeth Jettee . The Prosecutor came into Haughton 's House about 9 o'Clock in the Morning , on Saturday the 23d of February , and called for a Pint of Two-penny . My Master came down Stairs and the Prosecutor asked him to drink with him ; and they drank together till 12 o'Clock , at Noon , and then my Master went out , and did not come home till between 12 and one o'Clock , and then went directly to Bed . The Prosecutor went to Bed , up one pair of Stairs , about 9 o'Clock in the Evening ; - I am sure he went into the naked Bed . Couns . Who kept the Prosecutor Company ? Jettee . He was in his own Company a considerable Time ; - with no Body but himself . From 9 o'Clock in the Morning till about 2 in the Afternoon , he sat below Stairs , with no body but himself , and had a considerable Parcel of Liquor . Between 4 and 5 he went up Stairs into the Bedchamber ; I went up with him , and lit a Fire in the Room , and there he sat . Couns . And who sat with him above Stairs . Jettee . There was a young Woman with him , that lodges in our House ; one Sue Archer . Couns . Was not your Mistress , and Jemmet with him above Stairs too ? Jettee . No . About 8 o'Clock the next Morning ( Sunday ) he got up , and came down Stairs , and drank very considerably till about 11 o'Clock , then he went out , I do n't know where , and it was before my Master was up . On Monday Evening , about Candle-light , he returned , and not before . Couns . So you are positive he went out of the House before your Master was up ? Jettee . Yes ; and he did not come back before Monday Afternoon ; - no , 't was Monday Night , and then my Master was at Home , and the Prosecutor asked him to drink with him , but he refused it , because he was ill . He was very much in Liquor at this Time , and seemed very good natured ; and said he had left his Watch at next Door , but did not tell us why he left it there , nor where he lay on Sunday Night . That Monday Night he lay at our House , and the next Day , ( Tuesday ) he went away between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , and asked my Mistress to lend him 2 or 3 Shillings . Couns . Was you there when he first came into the House ? Jettee . Yes ; and he sat and drank , and smoaked several Pipes , and was very sober , ( to my thinking , ) when he came in ; and no body came to him , but the young Gentlewoman who lodges in our House , and is a Sailor 's Wife , - but I never saw her Husband in my Life . She has lodged in our House , between 4 and 5 Months , and was no Stranger to the Prosecutor , for he asked her , when she first came in ( between 12 and one ) to sit down and drink with him . She did not sit down with him at first , but went up Stairs , and staid in her own Room for about an Hour and a Quarter , then she came down , and he asked her again to drink with him . She accordingly sat down and drank with him for two or three Hours in the publick Room . Then the Gentleman ordered a Fire to be made in another Room , [ the Kitchen . ] The Sailor 's Wife went and sat some Time with him , and then she went out of the House , and he sat a good part of the Time by himself . Between 5 and 6 he went up Stairs into the Chamber , and no one but myself went up with him , and he staid there till 9 o'Clock , then he went to Bed . Couns . Did not Archer go up Stairs with him ? Jettee . Not till I went to shew him his Bed . From 5 to 9 he sat alone , and drank and smoaked above Stairs all alone.- I can not say positively , whether he was , or was not alone , all the Time ; - most part of the Time he was alone . I was in the Room when he went to bed , and took away his Candle . Couns . And what Quantity of Liquor did he drink before he went to bed ? Jettee . About 30 or 40 s. in Punch . Couns . Why he could not drink all this alone ; Who drank with him ? Jettee . Mrs Archer . Couns . You said just now she was not with him . Jettee . He drank a great deal himself . My Master drank none , and my Mistress never sat down in his Company . As soon as he got up in the Morning , ( Sunday ) he had a 3 s. Tiff , and more Liquor after that . He went out that Day about 11 in the Forenoon , and between 8 and 11 he made up a Reckoning of 11 or 12 Shillings , which my Mistress brought on Sunday Morning : But then there was somebody or other drinking with him ; for he asked every body that came in to drink . All this while , there was no Dispute at all ; I neither saw , nor heard of a Purse ; and as to the Watch , he told my Master where he had left it ; and told him if he would take it into his Custody , he would call in 8 or 9 Days , and fetch it again . I was in the House when Mr F - came about the Watch , and my Mistress told him , she had none of it ; and that it was not left there , nor did she offer him the Watch again for 2 Guineas . Thomas Glanville . [ The Landlord at Stepney . ] The last Tuesday in February , Tuesday or Wednesday , the 26th or 27th Day of the Month , - I am sure it was one of those Days , the Prosecutor came into my House about Half an Hour after 10 or 11 o'Clock at Night , and setting himself down by the Fire-side , he called for a Pint of Beer . I scrupled drawing it , because it was late ; but he desiring one Pint , I drew it him , and he drank it up at a Draught , and held out the Pot for another . I told him I would draw no more : then he begged I would let him have a Pint of Small Beer . I fetch 'd him that , and he drank half of it , and desired me to mend it . I mended it , and we drank 10 or 11 Pints together ; - In short , we both got drunk , and then the Prosecutor wanted a Fire to be lighted . I told him he should have one if he would pay for it ; and a Fire being made , we both sat drinking till 7 or 8 in the Morning . After which I happened to see a Miller going by , whom I knew , and I asked him if he knew the Chap I had been drinking with ? Yes , says he , -'tis 'Squire F - , let him have what he will : if he runs up 10 L. your Money is safe . About 10 o'Clock he pull 'd off his Newmarket Coat , and laid down upon the Bed.- He staid at my House from that Night , to the Wednesday se'nnight following . When he had been at my House a day or two , I went and told his Miller where his Master was , and in the Evening a Man came , and would have taken him home , but he could not get him away : So the next Evening I went down to Madam F - , and told her , where he was . 'T is his Humour , said she , - I am glad he 's in an honest House ; let him have what he will . What he will ! says I , Why then he 'll kill himself ! 'T is his Humour , let him have what he pleases , he 'll pay you . While he was in my House , a Gentleman came to him , and they had some Discourse together ; and when he went away , he told me the Prosecutor had been robbed ; I asked him about it ; He was in Liquor , and did not care to speak , but at last he told me his Watch was safe . Thomas Littlewood . I saw the Prosecutor at Haughton 's on Saturday the 23d of February , and spent 6d . with him there . Haughton is a Marshal's-Court Officer , and I am a Brewer , and serve him with Beer . I look upon him to be a very honest Man , and would trust him with 40 or 50 L. to-morrow . I have not heard a general ill Character of the House . 'T is not a bad House , as I know of , - any more than any other , that is a Publick House . Frances Saunders , Mr Glanville 's Wife 's Nurse at Stepney , deposed , she heard the Prosecutor tell her Master , his Watch was safe . Sarah Ainsworth . This Gentleman ( the Prosecutor ) came on the Sunday Morning to Jemmet 's House , and asked if she sold any thing to drink . Yes , she said , he might have any thing to drink that he pleased . He called for Punch , and had a Bowl or two . I can not tell how much he paid for a Bowl , - I believe it was 3s . a piece . Then he went up Stairs , and desired the Company of me , and another young Woman who was with me . We went up and drank with him ; and he called for more Liquor , and drank plentifully - I believe to the Amount of 16 or 18 Shillings . He staid from Sunday , to Monday about 5 o'Clock in the Evening , and made a Present of Half a Guinea between the young Woman and me for keeping him Company . The Reckoning was high , before he went away , and Jemmet beginning to be uneasy about it , she asked him for Money . He told he had none , but desired her to take a Note of Hand . She did not care to do that ; so he put his Hand in his Pocket , and bid her carry his Watch to pawn : She took it in her hand , and told him it was Sunday , she could not pawn it then , and gave it him again : But he gave it her back again , and bid her keep it in her Custody , and he would come in a Week or 10 Days to redeem it . He would have had more Liquor , but Jemmet refused him , and desired him to go about his Business , else he had no Desire to go away . Jemmet . Did not you score the Reckoning upon the Table before him . Ainsworth . Yes ; and it was not rubbed out a Week after . Jemmet . What did the Reckoning come to ? Ainsworth.3l.7s . and 1d . Jemmet . And the odd Penny was for a Penny-worth of Tobacco . Did not you sit up all Night a drinking with him ? Ainsworth . He lay down upon the Bed , and drank as he lay down : he was a Beast of a Man , & c . Couns . Pray does the Prisoner Jemmet keep a Publick House ? Ainsworth . No , - only a House to lodge in . She is poor , and sells Liquors , tho ' she never keeps any in the House . 'T was Punch we drank ; - I do n't know what it was made of , but there were no Jellies in it , nor can I tell what House it came from . I know she never keeps any Ingredients by her to make Punch with , - except Sugar . Henry Blundell . Jemmet told me she had a Watch left with her for 3 l.7s.1 d. and I went with her to the Prosecutor 's House about it . He was not at Home , but she told his Wife that her Husband had left his Watch with her for 3l.7s . and 1d . and she must have her Money , or must part with the Watch . The Gentlewoman desired her not to part with it , and sent us to a Place to enquire for him , We went thither and we saw the Prosecutor , who told us , - he thought Mr F - had been with her and had paid the Money . She said no , he had not , and she would not part with the Watch to any one but himself . The Prosecutor then told her , he would give her 2 Guineas if she would return the Watch . No , said she , I ca n't take that for 3l.7s.1d . Why then says he , I 'll serve you as I did Moll Thomas , a little while ago ; I 'll swear a Robbery against you . Couns . Pray where do you live ? Blundell . I live in Dirty Lane , by Blackman street , - I am a Dyer . Prosecutor . There was a Man with me about the Watch , but it was not this Man ; - I take him to be a very vile Fellow . The Jury acquitted all the Prisoners . 291. James Milroy was indicted for stealing 30 lb . of Tobacco , val.10s . the Goods of a Person unknown , June 25 . Thomas Watson I am a Watchman belonging to Aldgate : as I was on Duty the 25th of June , between 11 and 12 at Night , I saw the Prisoner coming along with a Parcel on his Back , and I asked him what he had got there ? He refused to tell me ; upon which I insisted upon knowing . Then said he , I will go back to the Place , and tell you where I had it . I went a little Way with him , and he threw down the Bundle , and ran away . He got a little Way from me , but we took him in a few Minutes . Prisoner . Ask him where he detected me first ? Watson . I stopped him in Poor Jewry Lane , near Aldgate , at the Backside of the Three Tunn Tavern . He ran to Towerhill before he was taken ; I am positive the Prisoner is the Man . A Witness . I happened to be going home to my Lodging , when the Watchman first detected the Prisoner , and asked him what he had got upon his Head . He desired him to go to the Watch-house , and shew him what it was . The Prisoner told him , he would go and shew him the Place from whence he had it , and it being in my way home , I went with them . But when he had got 10 or 12 Yards from the Place where he was first stopped , he threw down the Goods and ran away ; and the Watchman followed him crying stop Thief . He was first stopped in Poor Jewry Lane , near Aldgate . Prisoner . I was come from on Board o'Ship at Deptford , and was going home to my Lodging in Wheatsheaf Alley ; and as I was going over Tower-hill in my Way home , a Man stopped me , and they said I was the Person . I asked them what I had done , but they took me to the Watch-house , and said I was the same Man , because I had white Cloaths on , trimmed with the same . - Weaver . I am a Watchman belonging to Aldgate , and was at my Stand , when the Prisoner escaped from Watson . He cried stop Thief ; I followed , and the Prisoner ran thro ' Savage Gardens , where I lost Sight of him for 4 or 5 Minutes , by his turning the Corner , but I recovered Sight of him again , in that Time , and never lost it again till he was taken . Prisoner . How far was you from me when I was taken ? - Weaver . About 7 or 8 Yards . Another Witness .

I said I believed they were in a Bundle I had from the Prisoner . I carried the Bundle to the Colonel 's , and would not let it be opened till I came there . I asked him if he had lost any Forks on such a Day ? Upon his saying yes , I told him I had a Bundle left with me by Sargery , which I shewed him . He opened it , and there were two Forks in it which proved to be his : he got another Fork of the same sort , and compared them together . The Bundle was never opened all the Time it was in my Custody ; nor till it was carried before Colonel De Veil . This is the Paper they were wrapped up in . Prisoner .

I told her yes , and she desired me to go with her to get a Warrant for her . This was on the 23d of May ; and on the 24th I took her at Bow , and brought her before Justice Fowkes , where she owned she took the Watch off the Nail by the Side of the Chimney , and had intended to take it , a good while before she actually did it , if she could have known how to have disposed of it . But one Mrs Jons telling her she could vend such a thing for her , she then took it .

John Dukes came to me about this Affair , and we got a Warrant to apprehend the Prisoner , and carried her before a Justice : she owned to me before we carried herthither , that she had taken the Watch , and had pawned it , but would not tell us where it was pawned ; because the Woman to whom she had given it to pawn for her , had lent her Money upon it herself . This is the Watch , and she owned she took it . Thomas Dukes . This is my Watch . Prisoner . Whatever they say , - I used to wash at Mrs Dukes 's House , and she owing a Quantity of Money to a certain Person , told me , if her Husband should come to the Knowledge of it , she should have a good deal of Anger : So she gave me the Watch out of her own Hand to pawn for her , and when her Husband missed it , she came and swore to me downright .

Elizabeth Grazeff Widow , and Elizabeth Grazeff Spinster , of St James 's Westminster , were indicted for stealing a Silk Scarf , val.19 s. a Linnen Shirt , val.18 s . and a Linnen Gown , val.25 s. the Goods of the Reverend George Lumley , Clerk , in the Dwelling-House of Edward Darling , Dec.2 . The Rev . Mr Lumley . What I have to say in the Affair is this . That the Goods contained in the Indictment were my Property . That those Goods were actually locked up in a Box . That in that Box were a Scarf , a Gown , and a Shirt . That they broke open - A - Box belonging to me . That the Box was in the House of Edward Darling . I ca n't positively say his Name is Edward Darling , - but his Name is Darling , and I take it to be Edward Darling . I have more Reason to apprehend his Name is Edward , than the contrary . That this Box was broke open , and it was in the House of Edward Darling , in the House where the Prisoners lodg 'd . That this house is in Queen-street , Westminster , by the Haymarket , - by Piccadilly . The Things were in that House on the 2d of December ; that is , the Box in which the Things were contain 'd . Besides , - several other Things were then , - and there , - deposited in the Custody of the 2 Prisoners . I my self consented to have them put into their Custody : and in their Possession they were , - and they were so by my Consent . Now what I have to observe farther is , - I have already observed that these Goods were mine , and I do declare , as I am upon my Oath , that the 2 Prisoners at the Bar did say , They broke open this Box , and took the Goods out of the Box , in order to pledge them , - in order to raise a certain Sum of Money upon them . I did not lodge in the same House , - I came from Portsmouth , - I am Chaplain of the Centurion Man of War ; and when I came to Town , I put the Box into their Possession . My Spouse was acquainted with them , - I never was acquainted with them above a Month , or 6 Weeks , tho ' my Spouse had known them some time before . This particular Box was sent to them , by my Direction.- It was not only directed to them , but was left in their Custody . This Box did not come from Portsmouth , for the Box , - this Box , my Lord , was a Box that my Wife had to put her Linnen in , and several other necessary things ; and when I took it to Town , I put in my Scarf , and the Shirt , and the Linnen Gown ; and this Box ( my Lord ) was broke open . Now this Box I did not send it from Portsmouth , - My Wife took it from Lambeth : and this Box had afterwards a Lock put to it , after it came from Lambeth . That this Box was lock 'd , - is out of the Question , - it was sent immediately from Lambeth to Darling 's House , and my Wife sent it . I have already told you , - that this Box did not come from Portsmouth ; that these Things were not contained in the Box , when it came from Lambeth ; but I put these Things into it , in the House of Darling , and locked it with my own Hands.- I put them in with my own Hands , after the Box came there . If I might be so bold as to trouble the Court with a long Detail , as Sir Edward Hill is not here , - but if Sir Edward Hill was here , he could inform you , that if I did not prosecute them , they would prosecute me ; for they had a Warrant out against me : I went before Sir Edward , and he discharged a Warrant they had against me . I have no Malice in the Thing , but if I would not prosecute them , they would prosecute me . My Lord , this Box was in their Custody , and it was locked both then , and before , and , my Lord , I lock 'd it with my own Hands , after I had put the Things into it ; and the Key I have now , - I took it away with me . Sir , With regard to the Shirt that I put into the Box , my Servant was present , when I put it in , but he is at Portsmouth . The 2 Prisoners were then present , and this was on the 2d of December , as I was telling you before , - if I was to go into a Detail of the thing . I missed them on the 3d of December , - the Day following ; for I lodged in the same Street , and on coming there for my Shirt , as I came from Portsmouth with but 2 Shirts , I went for this , and on my coming there , the Box was broke open , - I found it broke open ; and on finding the Box broke open , I told my Spouse , I was surprized at a thing of that Nature ; and my Spouse was gone to Breakfast with the 2 Prisoners at the same Time . What I observe farther on the Affair , is this , - finding myself deprived of my Effects , I probably made a Noise , and so a Warrant was granted against me by Sir Edward Hill , on Account of that Noise I made , about these things . But ( with Submission ) I made so much Noise , that Sir Edward discharg 'd me , he did not think proper to commit me . Afterwards I sent to the Prisoners at the Bar.- I told them , - provided they would let me have my Effects again , I was willing not to prosecute them.- This I did say ; and upon this , in order that I should not prosecute them , they arrested me , in an Action for 50 s. on Account of my Brother and my Wife ; which Action I have their full Discharge for . All I have to say , is this , - they did actually declare they pawned these things at one Mr Grubb 's , and this I know by their own Confession , when I went before Sir Edward Hill ; and to the best of my Remembrance it might be about the 14th of Dec. then or thereabouts . But , as I observed before , - they confessed the thing at first , - they confessed it the 3d of December . I have already observed what they said the 3d of December . They both said , they had actually taken a Scarf , a Gown , a Shirt , and had pawn 'd them actually , in the Hands of Grubb ; and they had nothing to say in Excuse , more than this , - That my Wife was consenting to it . That I suppose they will say now , and That is all the Case I suppose . Jury . How long is it since you was arrested for 50 Shillings ? And when did you pay it ? Mr Lumley . It was paid to the best of my Remembrance , last Good Friday . My Agent 's Clerk - Mr Jasper 's Clerk paid it . They actually arrested me , and put me into the Marshalsea , to prevent the Prosecution . Defence . Grazeff jun . Mr Lumley being at Portsmouth , I used to visit Mrs Lumley ; and while I was there one Day , her Landlady seized her Goods ; upon which she begged , I would let her come home and lie with me . I took her home , with her Brother-in-Law , and her Servant . Mrs Lumley lay with me for a fortnight ; and I helped the Brother to a Lodging in the Neighbourhood , where he continued 3 Weeks , Mr Lumley promising to pay for it . He had Stockings , Handkerchiefs , Gloves , and other Things of us before he went to Portsmouth ; and signed the Bill , that we might receive it at Mr Jasper 's ; but Mr Jasper refused to pay it unless the Prosecutor was present : Yet Mr Lumley wanted a Receipt from us in full ; and one Sunday Night he made such a Riot in the House about this Bill , cursing and brawling , that the Landlord of the House came , and begged he would not make such a Noise ; but he persisted in making the Riot , and threatened to break a Glass , which cost us Four Pounds . He never demanded any Goods , for the Box was delivered to him . And , on Account of this Riot , Mr Darling got a Warrant for him , but Sir Edward Hill would not commit him , because he was a Clergyman . As to the Goods , Mrs Lumley would never trust us with any , for fear we should stop them ; and all the Things that were pawned , she pawned herself ; and those which he charges us with , were never at our House at all . Mr Lumley . By those whom they presume to call to their Characters , it will be found on their Examination , that they were in the House . Prisoners . We never pawned any of the things . We are near Neighbours to Mr Grubb , and he might have had him here to have proved it , if we had done it . William Bird . I know nothing of the Prisoners , but happened to be casually going by this Place , and heard , that Mr Lumley was carrying on a Prosecution , I came in ; and all I have to say , is this , That I know him , his Wife , and his Mother , and know them to be a very base , vile People . I take him to be a very vile Fellow , and do believe that he would not speak Truth upon Oath . Mary Crossman . Mr Lumley and his Wife lodged at our House between 5 and 6 Months . Elizabeth Grazeff the younger used to come to see them ; she was a particular Acquaintance of theirs , and , as I thought , a Friend . To my Knowledge , she has lent them Things to pledge , to serve them in their Necessity . ( The Box was produced . ) This small Box was all they brought to my House , with all the Materials they had ; and it was in the same Condition as it is now , without a Lock , and but one Hinge to it . He went away in December , and his Wife went in the same Month . Mr Lumley . I desire she may be asked , if I had not a Scarf in that Box , which cost me 19 s. and 9 d. half-penny . Crossman . He had a Scarf , but that was gone : and he had another which he brought from Portsmouth , and that was not worth Half a Crown . Mr Lumley . Why , which way did the Scarf go ? Crossman . Why , I believe the Way that all the rest of his Things went ; - they had pawned them all , and had nothing to put on their Backs . I seized what was left , for my Rent , and here is an Inventory of all the Goods that I seized . Tho Cross . Grazeff the Younger was acquainted ( I know ) with Mrs Lumley ; she used to come to see the Lumleys , and I believe was a Friend to them . He gave an Account of Mr. Lumley 's trifling with him on Account of a Debt , but this had no relation to the Matter in Question . Elizabeth Hoskins . Some Time ago , I was going along the Strand , and saw Mr Lumley and his Mother . The Mother said , this is one of Mrs Grazeff 's Kinswomen . Mr. Lumley damned and cursed both Mrs Grazeff , and her Daughter ; and said , he would do their Business for them . He said he had got one of them in Newgate , and that he would have them both transported . Mr Lumley . I desire she may be asked , whether she did not come to me once or twice , in order to make up this Affair . Hoskins . I came to your House to speak to your Mother about it , but it was at your own Request . Nathaniel Brown . I have known the two Prisoners at the Bar , for some Time . They know nothing of my being here ; nor did I know any thing of this Affair , till now but as I happened to be here , I can say , they live not 100 Yards from me , and bear as honest Characters as any People in the World . They keep a Milliner 's Shop , and sell Gloves ; I never heard the least ill Thing of them in the World . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners , and the Court granted them a Copy of the Indictment . 296. William Bird of Pancras was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c . in and upon Mary Bird his Wife , felonoiusly , & c . did make an Assault , and with both his Hands , in and upon the top of the Head of the said Mary , divers Times , feloniously did strike and beat , giving her a mortal Bruise of which she instantly died . June 22 . He was a second Time charged by Virtue of the Coroner 's Inquest , for feloniously slaying the said Mary . Mary Slate . I lodged in William Bird 's House almost two Years . On Sunday Morning , the 21st or 22d of June , when the Accident happened , the Prisoner 's Prentice Girl came up and called me between 3 and 4 in the Morning . When I came down Stairs , I found her lying dead upon the Floor , and he lay by her . Then I called the Prisoner 's Sister Barker , who lodged a little higher up the Road , at the Dog and Duck . When we came down to the House again , he staggered himself up , and went up Stairs , in a staggering Manner . I found her dead in the Shop , upon the Floor , and he lying by her . After he had staggered up Stairs , he laid himself on the Bed . About 12 o'Clock , a Woman ( whom I never saw before or since as I know of ) came up and asked him how the Accident happened ? His Answer was , - it was unlucky . I , and another Woman , stripped the deceas 'd , and all the Marks I saw upon her , were 2 Blows , - black Marks , one on one Shoulder , and one on another ; and a little Pinch on her upper Lip . The black Marks were just on the Top of her Shoulders . They lived together pretty well , except some Times , when he had a little Liquor in his Head : then he would swear at her , but I never saw him strike her in my Life . He has a Child by her which is now between 23 and 24 Years of Age . Paul Lewis . I was employed as a Surgeon , to open the deceased 's Head ; and I found a small Wound upon the very top of the Head , which I suspected was the Occasion of her Death I took off the hairy Scalp , and underneath the Scalp , upon the Skull , I found 2 small Fractures , about the Length of half an Inch each , which did not pene trate farther than the first Table . Then I opened the Skull , and under those Fractures , between the Dura Mate and the Pia Mater , I found a large quantity of extravasated Blood , which I imagine was the cause of her Death . The Prisoner had stabbed himself , as soon as he found his Wife was dead , and the Sword had penetrated 6 or 7 Inches into his Body , his Sword was bloody above 5 Inches . Upon finding the Wound to be a Puncture , I opened it above 6 or 7 Inches ; and during the Time I attended to dress him , Mr Wilson asked him how the Accident happened ? He said he gave the deceas 'd an unhappy blow , with his Right-Hand , for being a Left-handed Man , he was afraid if he struck her with his Left-Hand , he should have done her a Mischief . With that Blow he said the deceas 'd reeled from one side of the Room to the other , and fell against a Sand-Binn ; for they kept a Chandler 's Shop , and had a Birm in the Shop to put Sand in . He said she reeled and fell with her Head against the Sand-Binn . She had one Bruise upon her Shoulder , but I do n't remember she had any other Marks about her . The Prisoner always seemed in a distracted condition , every Time I went to dress him ; which I took to proceed from his Concern for the loss of his Wife : for he always said when I went to him , that she was the best Wife that ever lived with any Man , and that he would give all that ever he had had in the World , if she could be restored to him again . Nor would he suffer her to be taken out of the Room , tho ' she smelt strong , till the Coroner had sat upon the Body . I saw him about 8 o'Clock in the Morning after the Accident , and we could not imagine how he gave himself the Wound : upon which he desired us to let him see his Sword , and he would shew us ( he said ) how he did it ; but we kept it from him , and were obliged to keep People about him , for fear he should do himself a Mischief . I ca n't believe that the Wound on the Head of the Deceased was given by a Blow with the Fist , 't is more likely it was done by the Fall : The Wound corresponded with the Mark on the Shoulder , and I apprehend it must have been done with the Fall , and could not possibly be done by his striking her . John Barker . The Deceased was my Wife 's Sister . I can say nothing about the Accident . I have known the Prisoner 13 Years , and by all that I have seen , I know they lived very happy together . Now and then they might have a few Words , but I never saw any Blows given in my Life . Jane Barker . I am the Deceased 's Sister . About 4 o'Clock in the Morning I was called to her House ; and when I came , she lay dead upon the Floor : My Brother had stabb 'd hi mself , and lay upon the Ground by her , side by side . I know they liv 'd as lovingly together as any two People could do . They were married the same Month that King George the First was crown 'd in , and have had a matter of 10 or 12 Children born and christen 'd , besides Miscarriages . They always lived very lovingly together , except sometimes . He was passionate , and she was as passionate as he . The best in the World may have Words sometimes . I live within 4 Doors of them , and never saw him strike her in my Life . I have heard him threaten her , but if she went out of Doors , he never offered to follow her . I was always with them from the time I got up , ( if it was 5 in the Morning ) 'till Night when I went to Bed.- I was always there , but never see him strike her . I can say , he is as honest a Man as ever the Ground carried , and is far from being quarrelsome . Jury . The Surgeon says there were 2 small Fractures , half an inch long ; we desire he may be asked again , Whether he believes they came by the Fall against the Binn ? Mr Lewis . Yes , I believe they did ; for they were within a quarter of an inch of one another . They were so near , and so small , that they did not make an Inch in all , with the Distance between them . There were 2 Fractures in the Skull , and but one Wound on the hairy Scalp . Brigadier Foliard . I have known the Prisoner 20 Years , I served in the same Regiment with him . He is a very sober , quiet , peaceable Man ; I never knew him quarrel in my Life . Major Hunt . I have known him 20 Years . He is a very humane , good-natur 'd , quiet Man , and not given to quarrel . I have had him several times upon Guard with me , where he has had frequent Opportunities to shew his Temper , and I always found him a quiet , peaceable Man . Capt . Carey . I have the Honour to be in the Regiment with this Gentleman . I have known the Prisoner 15 Years , and have had some Opportunity to observe his Temper . For a Friend of mine being ill , he had a Mind to have this Man to attend him , and he was with me ( on that Account ) Nine Months , Day and Night : every other Day , he begg 'd leave to go home and see his old Woman , as he called her , and he constantly went every other Day to see her , and came back in an Hour and an half ; during which Time he gave her his Pay , and liv 'd himself , on what I allowed him . He is a quiet , peaceable Man , and a good Man , else I would not have entrusted him with a sick Man , and one who was a Person of Quality . The Jury found him Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding .

As I was coming along Leather-Lane , the 28th of June , I saw that honest Man at the Bar there , taking a Firkin of Beer off 'Squire Green 's Dray . 'T was Small Beer , - I do n't justly know the Value of it , for I did not belong to the Dray . I thought the Prisoner had no Business with the Beer , so I said to him , '' Friend you do n't `` belong to the Dray , you had better let the Beer alone . '' '' I am only going to carry it a little Way , says he , and so he took it away . Upon this I called in at Mr Green 's Yard , and told his Men ; they went after the Prisoner , and took him . Thomas Lovelage . Hill called to me in the Yard , and told me , a Man was taking a Barrel of Beer off the Dray : I went after the Prisoner , and just as I came to Hatton Wall , I saw he had pitch 'd the Firkin of Mr Green 's Beer , upon a Bench . When I took him , he said a Man was to give him a Pint of Beer , to carry it to the Place where he had pitch 'd it . Prisoner . There was a Man at the Dray , who promised me a Pint of Beer to carry it to the Farrier 's Shop . and there leave it . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 305.

I heard this , and asked her what she would have for them ? We bargain 'd for 12 Shillings , and I afterwards sold the Waistcoat . But the Breeches hanging out of the Window , tho ' the Gold Buttons which were on them were cut off , and others put on , yet Mr Riddle coming by the Shop , knew them , challeng 'd them , and said he had lost a Waistcoat with them ; and upon this I discover 'd the Prisoner . Prisoner . My Husband * brought them to me and told me he had bought them : but they not fitting him , I first carry 'd them to pawn , and afterwards sold them to Jackson . * Her Husband John Cane was convicted last April Sessions , for robbing Mr Wren , in New-street , Covent Garden , of Sundry Wearing Apparil .

And Mary Thomas was indicted for receiving 2 Bed-quilts , knowing them to be stole . Mr Watson . The Prisoner Miles was my Servant . On the 21st of June , one Mr Cripple came to me , and told me he believed my Servant had robb 'd me , and if I would take up Grace Morgan , and Mary Thomas , I might hear of my Goods again . I took up Grace Morgan , and she told me she had sold a Quilt to one Lee , at Admiral Carter 's Head , in Bartholomew Close , and 2 others to one Brown who keeps the Blue Anchor in Little Britain . I went to them , and they said they would return them to me again . Soon after this , the Man at the Stationers Arms , in Little Britain , came to me , and said he believed my Servant had robb 'd me of a Tick , and if I would send my Servant to him , he should have it . I cast up my Stock of Ticks , and miss 'd one , but I ca n't be positive that this was mine William Cripple the Constable went after the Prisoner Thomas , and she was tax 'd with receiving the Quilts , knowing them to be stole . Then I came Home to Miles , who was detain 'd in my House , and says I to him , - You 're a pretty Fellow , to wrong me in this Manner , - I have found 3 Quilts ; have you robb 'd me of any more ? He told me , he believed he had taken 5 . The Prisoner Thomas , when she was going before my Lord Mayor , own 'd she had receiv 'd 2 Quilts , and if I would be quiet , and easy with her , I should have them again , for they were at the Pawnbroker 's . I carry 'd Miles and Thomas before my Lord Mayor ; and he would have committed them to Newgate , but I desired they might be sent to the Counter ; and as we were carrying them thither I desired the Constable to take Thomas to the Alehouse , to see if he could get out of her , where the Quilts were ; he carry 'd her into a House , and in about 2 Hours Tim , the Quilts were brought to me , by a Man , she ( Thomas ) told me she had sent for them to the Pawnbroker 's , and that they were the same Quilts my Servant Miles had brought to her House . This Quilt I ca n't swear to ; the other 4 I can . My Son is in Partnership with me , and the Goods are mine and his . William Cripple . I had Information by Grace Margan , that a Fellow had brought several Quilts to her Mistress , and Mrs Thomas , and that the Gentleman who owned them liv 'd in Guildhall Yard . I went to the Prosecutor , and he got a Warrant against the 3 Persons . We charged Miles first : then we took Morgan , and she confessed 3 Quilts , and I went with her to the Places where they had been disposed of . Then he went to Mrs Thomas 's ; and she own 'd she had had 2 Quilts from Miles , and Miles confessed he had carried 2 to her . These are the 2 Quilts : They are sealed , that we might know them again . When my Lord-Mayor committed them , Thomas made a great Outcry , upon which Mr Watson desired they might only be committed to the Counter , because it would be easier for him to have Access to them there , than in Newgate . While we were going from my Lord-Mayor 's , Thomas desired Mr Watson would be easy , and she would send for the 2 Quilts . Accordingly , we went into the Golden Fleece , and she sent a Man for them , and I saw them delivered to Mr Watson Mr Watson . Thomas keeps a Gin shop , and sells Greens . Mary Cripple . I have seen Miles come to Grace Morgan , and deliver Quilts to her several Times , but on what Account , I ca n't tell . Samuel Smith confirmed Mr Cripple 's Evidence ; adding , that Miles declared when he and Thomas were carried before my Lord-Mayor , that he had but 9 s . in Money from Thomas for the 2 Quilts , the rest he had in Liquors ; but this was not said in Thomas 's hearing . Prisoner Miles . As far as I know , - this Woman here , and the other ( Morgan ) did induce me to do it . They both keep a Dram-Shop , and I was drinking there , and happened to do this . Prisoner Thomas . Grace Morgan brought this young Man , ( Miles ) to my House , with 2 Quilts in her Lap , and desired my Servant to pawn them for her . She took them and pawned them , and gave him the Money : what it was , I can not tell . Ann Carnaby . Grace Morgan brought Miles to Mary Thomas and desired her to let me pawn 2 Quilts ; she gave me the Quilts out of her Apron : I pawned them , and gave Miles the Money , and then they went away together . Mrs Thomas sells Gin , but Miles spent none of that Money there then . Ann Eglington , Hannah Rowden , Ann Husband , Roger Barret , Joseph Belch , John Rowden , Thomas Brickhill , William Bowles , and Samuel Brook , gave Thomas a good Character . Miles guilty 39 s.

See summary . ] 310.+ Ann Harris , of St. Sepulchre 's , was indicted for stealing 7 Yards and a half of Cambrick , val.34 s. the Goods of George Savage , in his Shop , June 3 . George Savage . The Prisoner came to my Shop for a Piece of Cambrick , telling me it was for Mrs Webb ; she desired to have a Piece at 3 s.6 d. a Yard , - the same sort with which I had served the Prisoner , for Mrs Webb , once before . I shewed her one Piece , but she did not like it ; then I took 2 other Pieces out of a Box , and she said she liked the first Piece best . So I bid my Servant take the Book , and enter the Piece ( which the Prisoner had chose ) to Mrs Webb , and I went to the Compting-House , to make a Bill of Parcels . In the mean Time , my Servant put up the two Pieces which we had shewn the Prisoner , and one Piece was missing . I bid my Servant look carefull , over the Pieces , lest we should make a Mistake . He told them over , and still one Piece was missing . The Prisoner being gone out of the Shop , I bid my Man go to Mrs. Webb 's and enquire after her , but Mrs. Webb said she had not sent her . Upon this I went to Mrs. Webb , and asked her where the Prisoner lived ? She told me she did not know , and made some Words . Then I went to another Friend , and having got Directions , I found the Prisoner , and charged her with a Fraud for one Piece , and with stealing another . I told her Mrs. Webb denied her being sent for Cambrick by her , and the Prisoner immediately said , - then I am ruined and undone ' I then asked her where the Piece of Cambrick was , which she said was for Mrs. Webb ? She told me it was at the Pawnbroker 's ; I went according to her Direction and found it ; and on Account of this Piece , I indicted her for a Fraud . But I am sure I missed one Piece beside ; and I have had several People with me , who have offered me Money not to prosecute ; but we are so pestered with these Shoplifters , that we are not able to stand in our Shops . Prisoner . I bargained with him for one Piece at 27 Shillings . Mr. Savage . Yes , for Mrs. Webb at the Crown-Tavern in Smithfield as she said . I accordingly delivered it to her , and she desired me if I went to Mrs. Webb 's , to take no notice to any Body , - not even to her Daughter , for Mrs. Webb , she said , would be a Customer to me , but there were so many Drapers in the Field , that she could not . Miles Wennington confirmed the Evidence of Mr Savage . Mary Webb . I sent the Prisoner once to Mr Savage 's for Cambrick , but not on the 3d of June . When I sent her , she paid for what she had . I have known her a pretty many Years ; and believe she has been guilty of pawning things , but I imagine what she has pawned was returned again . I do n't know of her ever having wronged me . Mary Selby , Mary Gibson , and Jane Collier , never knew her guilty of Theft in their Lives . Acquitted . 311. Richard Cheshire was indicted for stealing a silver Spoon , val.11 s. the Goods of William Hunter . July 1 . William Hunter . I keep the Crown-Inn in Holborn , and lost a silver Spoon last Wednesday was sevennight ; and it being Term-time , we were very busy , so we did not miss it , 'till 3 Days afterwards . The Prisoner used to clean Boots and Shoes , and I used to give him our broken Victuals : I did not suspect he had taken the Spoon , till he absconded , and left his Shop ( that is , his Brushes and Blacking ) in our Stable . Upon this I enquired after him , and a Poulterer in the Neighbourhood gave me Intelligence where to find him . As soon as I found him , I asked him why he did not come to our Inn , as usual ? Why Master ( says he ) they say you have lost something , and that you 'll put me in Goal . No , no , said I ; I want to send you with a Horse to Rumford , so I took him with me , and shewed him the Fellow to the Spoon ? I had lost , asking him if he knew that Spoon ? Indeed Master say 's he , I have not the Spoon . I asked him where it was ? He told me he had sold it for 10 s. at the Silversmith 's Shop at Holborn-Bridge . To the best of my Knowledge I gave 13 s.6 d. for it , as second Hand . He went with me , and shewed me the Shop ; and told the Silversmith , he had given him 2 Half-crowns and five Shillings for it : but the Silversmith denied it , and would not let me see it , telling me he would sue me for making a Rout , and charging him for buying it . Prisoner . Yes , Sir , I did own it . Mr Hunter . The Prisoner is foolish ; for I could not get a Constable the Day I took him , but he kept along with me , and I could not get rid of him all Day . I set a little Child of 6 Years old to look after him . 'till I got an Officer , and he look 'd more after the Child , than the Child after him . He own 'd the Fact . Prisoner . No , Sir , - no , Sir . Mr Hunter . I have entrusted him several Times , with Half a Dozen Pair of Silver Spurs , and have bid him clean them cleverly , and he has brought them me again honestly . The Silversmith is to blame to buy such a Thing , of a poor Fellow without either Hat or Shoes . I believe 't is his first Fact . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping .

Thomas Warner . On the 13th of June an old Woman brought this Watch to my House , - I forget her Name ; but she was bound over to appear here , - I asked the Old Woman some Questions about it , which she not answering to my Satisfaction , I told her I must stop it , till I found the Owner .

On the Day mentioned in the Indictment , I sent the Prisoner to fetch some Cloaths out of my Chest , that I might shift myself , and then I sent her to put up the foul ones . I did not then imagine she had took any thing out of the Chest , so I went to Cbelsea , and did not come home till 11 o'Clock at Night . Then my Wife told me , she missed the Money , and in order to fright the Prisoner , she charged me with taking it . Well , says I , we 'd go up to the Chest and look for it ; - but I did not take it . Accordingly , we search 'd in the Chest , but could not find it . Then we look 'd for it in the Prisoner 's Room and could see nothing of it . Why the Girl must have it , says I , and I will send for a Constable , and she shall go to the Round-House . Upon this the Prisoner confessed she took the Money , and had hid it in the Cellar ; and she went down into the Cellar , and fetch 'd it . I had all the Money again but 26 s. which she had paid , to fetch her Gold Necklace out of Pawn . This is the Necklace . I have it , and 4 Guineas and a half , and 3 s.6 d. of my Money again .

[ Mr Willis being one of the Middlesex Jury , Mr John Preston was sworn ( upon this Trial ) in his stead . ] Mr Willis . Those Pistols , and Shoes , I swear to be mine : I lost them the 21st of June , and hearing afterwards that a Thief was taken , I ask 'd , if any Shoes were found upon him ? I heard there was ; and when I went to see the Shoes , I saw the Pistols in the Constable 's Hands , and knew them to be mine . John Pitham . Some time ago the Prisoner hired a Horse of me , and there being a Dispute between us , about 10 s. for Horse-hire , I sent a dunning Lawyer to him , to make a Demand for the same , and after this he absconded from his Lodging . But on the 21st of June , he came to my House , and asked my Wife where I was ? I happened to be in the Stable ; and the Prisoner came to me , with these Pistols in the inside of his Coat , one on each Side ( in his Bosom , concealed under his Coat . ) Well Friend , says I , what do you want with me ? I tell you , ( said he ) your Lawyer and you , may wipe your A - s with the Writs , - D - mn you , I 'll do for you . What will you do ! - G - d d - mn you , I 'll blow your Brains out - and out he pulled a cock 'd Pistol , and presented it to my Breast . I told him , if I could not secure him by a Writ , I would send him to Goal for this , and I attempted to lay hold of him ; but he fell back , and swore he would blow my Brains out , if I drew near him . But I seized him by the Collar , and got his Pistol . He denied his having any more about him , yet upon searching him , we found the other Pistol , and the Shoes , a Child 's Frock , a Woman 's Smock , and 3 Handkerchiefs . All which were taken out of his Pockets . Thomas Mear confirmed the former Witness . Prisoner . I bought the Pistols , and the 2 Pair of Shoes ; and being in Liquor , I came to Mr Pilham 's House . If I had stole them , to be sure , I should not have come so near Mr Willis 's House ; for Mr Pitham and he live just by one another . And neither of the Pistols were charged when they took them . Mr Pitham . But here are 4 Bullets , and several Parcels of Powder which were found in the Prisoner 's Lodging . A Witness . The Prisoner was a very honest Man , as far as I know , - I have nothing more to say . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 320.

He was a second time charged by Virtue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Ann Vawdrey . The Prisoner lived in Golden-Lane , in Coxhead-Court , in a House there up two Pair of Stairs . The Prisoner and his Wife , and the Woman who lodged there , had been drinking in the Lodger 's Room , and being all very much in Drink , they all 3 fell fast asleep on the Floor . The deceas 'd used to borrow Money of the Woman that owned the Room , to go to Market with , and having borrowed 10 d. of her , she came last Wednesday was a seven-night to pay her : and she brought in some Onions and Cucumbers , and such Things as she used to sell , in her Basket with her . She asked me to help her to make two Bunches into three ; and while I was doing it , the Prisoner who had been fast asleep upon the Floor , got up upon his Knees , and said to me , - Pray Vawdrey lend me the Chamber-Pot , to make Water . I gave him the Pot , and the deceas 'd said to me , - How can you lend such a black-guard Fellow the Chamber-Pot , when you have had better to wipe your Shoes . But I had lent it him , and thought he was setting it down under the Bed , - for there was a Bed in the Room , tho ' they all lay on the Ground : and when he had put the Pot under the Bed , he took up the Broom and struck the deceased ( with the but-end ) upon the Head . Lord , Foster , said she , - I believe you have murdered me . He set the Pot down first ; and I thought he was going to lay himself down again , but as soon as he had set down the Pot . he took up the Broom , and hit her over the Head , - on the right side of the top of the Head ; and she immediately cried out , Lord have Mercy , I believe you have been my Butcher ! And then he up with the other end of the Broom ( the Handle ) and hit her again on one of her Shoulders , I am not positive , whether the Blow was on her right Shoulder or her left . He struck first with the but-end of the Broom on the Head , and afterwards on the shoulder with the other end . The Blow on the Head was a violent one ; it proved so ; and I saw the Blood run . She lived 5 Days after it , but the 2d Day she had such Fits that no body could hold her . She had 6 Fits one after another , and 't is my Opinion she died of the Wound . She went to one Surgeon , and to another , but they would not meddle with it , - They said it would be her Death 's Wound : at last she was got in St Bartholomew 's Hospital . Prisoner . I ask her who was in the Room , and whether she did not hit me 2 Slaps in the Face , and take up the Broom , and say she would dash my Brains out ? Vawdrey . There were in the Room with the Prisoner , the Deceased , his Wife , the Woman of the House , myself , and the Prisoner 's Child about 5 Years old . The deceas 'd never touched him ; I am sure of it . Prisoner . Had not the deceas 'd a Broom in her Hand ? Vawdrey . No ; I am sure she had not . Prisoner . Ask her if she did not say before Sir John Thompson , that the deceas 'd had the Broom in her Hand , and hit me two Slaps on the Face ? Vawdrey . No ; I declared before the Alderman , as I have done now : I made no such declaration as the Prisoner says I did . Ann Foster . I did not see the Fact committed , but the deceas 'd was my Sister ; and she knocked at my Door at 6 o'Clock in the Morning , and I asked her , what was the Matter ? She asked me if my Husband was at home ? - I told her no , he was gone out to work . As soon as I had opened the Door , she told me she had got her Death's-Wound . I said , I hoped not , and asked her , by whom she got it . She told me , by a Chimney-Sweeper in Golden-Lane , and that he had done it with a Broom . I went with her thither , and she shewed me the Room it was done in , and the Broom , and Prisoner 's Wife . I desired her to apply to the Church-Wardens , and they got her into the Hospital . The Thing was done on the Wednesday , and on the Saturday following she was got into the Hospital ; but the Wound had been dressed before she went thither . I never was in the Prisoner 's Room , till she carried me thither , and shewed me the Woman ( Vawdrey ) who saw it done . Samuel Lee . The deceas 'd came to me , about an Hour after the mortal Wound was given by the Prisoner ; 't was about 6 o'Clock , and I was abed . For Christ 's sake , said she , get up , and go with me to a Surgeon , for Foster has given me my Death 's wound ! I hope not , says I ; she said , yes he had , and the Blood ran all about her Head . The deceas 'd lived in the same House where I live , - here are 3 of her Caps ; [ they were all very bloody ] and she told me John Foster , had done it with the Hair-Broom . Vawdry . The Woman 's Name that lodged in the Room , is Storey ; but she has moved away from thence , on this Account , for fear she should come into Trouble . The Coroner , I enquired after her , and could hear nothing of her . Mr Manaton ( Surgeon ) I saw the deceas 'd on Saturday , between 11 and 12 . On the right side of the Head , was a large Wound , quite to the Scull , an Inch in Length . Upon examination , I found the Scull fractured , about the Breadth of half a Crown ; and depressed about half an Inch upon the Brain : and on trepanning her , and moving the fractured Parts of the Scull , I found the Membranes of the Brain wounded , and some small Portion of the Brain oozed from thence , about the Bigness of a Pea . She was at that Time , to admiration , sensible . The Accident happened on Wednesday , and this was on the Saturday following ; and there had been nothing more than a small piece of Lint applied to it . She lived to the Tuesday following ; then she died ; and without doubt , the Wound was the Occasion of her Death . I did not observe any Bruise on her Shoulder , nor was it represented to me , that she had any . She told me she had had Vomitings , and Fits , but she had none of them , during the Time I attended her . I asked her how the Accident happened ? and she said she was wounded by a Chimney-Sweeper , with a Hair-Broom , and represented the Thing to me , so strongly , that I had a perfect Idea of the Instrument , with which the Wound was given : and she farther said , it was done without Provocation . Vawdrey . I am positive she cried out , Lord have Mercy , you have been my Butcher , before the Prisoner hit her the second Blow , but that was not violent , I believe . Foster , the deceased 's sister . The deceased 's Maiden-Name was Shovel : She afterwards married Capt . Garret 's Son , but he was taken up , for having two Wives . Guilty , Death . 323.+ Margaret Chandler was indicted for privately stealing 11 s. from the Person of Richard Booth . Rich . Booth . My young Master sent me to Highgate , to see how my old Master did , who was not well there , and it was late before I returned to Town . It was 12 o'Clock at Night as I came along Cheapside ; and there this Woman ( the Prisoner ) stood with another Woman , between the Posts and the Houses , and they laid hold of me , and asked me , Whether I would have a Dram . I said no , I never drank any . But they held me very close , and asked me for some Half-pence ; for they said they could drink if I could not . And while they held me so fast , they picked my Pocket of 11 s. They held my Arms down while they did it , and I could not get loose from them , I am sure I had my Money in my Pocket not half an Hour before ; for I called at a House as I came along , and had a Pint of Beer , and changed some Money for my Beer , and my Money was then right in my Pocket ; but I missed it in a Minute after they had been with me . It was in this Breeches Pocket , and while they held down my Arms , I perceived the Prisoner drawing it from me , and I caught hold of her Arm , while she had it in her Hand . I know she had it right well.- I knew her before this Day . She had it all in her Right-hand , - eleven Shillings , and I had hold of her Arm all the Time ; and I saw her deliver it to the other Woman who was with her , and then I called the Watch ; and as soon as the Watch came nigh us , then the Prisoner let the other Woman go away with my Money , down Honey Lane Market , and I never saw her since ; but I kept fast hold of the Prisoner , and took her before the Constable , and he sent us both to the Compter , - the Constable at Ludgate sent us thither , and we were there from 3 o'Clock on Sunday Morning , to Monday Noon , and then we went to Guildhall , where I charged her with the Fact , and took my Oath o n't too . She had nothing to say for herself , - she could not ; but she denied it , and could not say any thing for crying . When they took my Money , they held me so close , that I was afraid of my Cloaths , as well as my Money ; for I thought they would have tore them off my Back , - one pulled one Way , and the other pulled t'other Way so . Prisoner . What Time was it you met me ? and what did I say to you ? Booth . Lord , forgive you , - you asked me to drink a Dram , and I said , I did not drink 3 Drams in a 12 Month . Defence . I had been at Billingsgate to buy Mackarel , and having sold them all but 5 , I carried those 5 to my Grandmother ; and as I was coming from thence up Cheapside , the Man met me , and asked me to drink a Dram ; he tore me about , and at last I drank a Dram , and then I went away ; but he followed me , and swore this against me , because I would not do as he would have me . Booth . What she says is false , for I did not drink a Dram all that Day ; I do n't drink 3 in a twelvemonth , - I ca n't drink Gin . The Constable who took Charge of her , lives in Butcher-Hall Lane , he knows me and my Master , but I did not think of bringing him here . Elizabeth Kingson , Elizabeth Underwood , Mary Horn , James Lake , and Elizabeth Stephenson gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest Body . Acquitted . 324.325.+ Tobias Isaacs , and Rachael Isaacs alias Rachael Jacobs , of St Catherine Creechurch , were indicted for stealing 8 Yards of Silver Netting for a Gown and Petticoat , val.20 l. a Gold Tissue Waistcoat , val.40 s. a Gold Repeating Watch , val.20 l. a Gold Equipage , val.30 l. a Gold Ring , a Pair of Silver Snuffers , a Silver Tea Kettle and Lamp,2 Pair of Silver Candlesticks , a Silver Pint Mug,5 Silver Spoons , a 12 Silver Handle Forks,6 Silver Tea Spoons , a Silver Tea-strainer , a Diamond Necklace and Ear-Rings and several other Things of great value , the Goods of Moses Demattos , in his Dwelling-house , June 16 . Mr Demattos . On the 16th of June , upon looking over my Trunk , I found my Silver , Gold , Jewels , Linnen , Laces , & c . lost . I charged the Prisoner Rachael ( who had been my Servant 4 Years ) with the Fact : She deny 'd it , but after a long Examination , she delivered me my Jewels back again , and upon my asking her for the rest of the Things , she told me , they were all very safe , and I should have them again , in an Hour , provided I would let her go for them , and send no body with her . I was willing to have my Goods again , and desirous to know who was concerned with her , therefore I let her go ; but I sent a Man to follow her , and to watch where she went . The Man return 'd in Half an Hour , and told me she was gone to an Inn , in Leaden-hall-street ; I went thither , but Rachael was gone from thence , and I heard no more of her till the 19th , and then I heard she was taken , and carried before Col. De Veil with the Goods ; that he had committed her to Newgate , and desired me to wait upon him the next Morning , that I might see the Goods . Accordingly I went thither between 10 and 11 o'Clock , and found the other Prisoner Tobias Isaacs . He had carried a Ring of mine to a Goldsmith , to be stretch 'd for him , to fit his Finger , and the Goldsmith gave me notice of it ; and he , not being able to give any Account how he came by it , was committed to New Prison . The Monday following he was examined again , and would give no Account where he had it . These are the Goods . These Jewels , these 3 Gold Rings , this Diamond Necklace , this Gold Necklace , and Gold Medal , were deliver 'd me by the Prisoner Rachael , and are Part of that I lost . They were in a Trunk , in my best Room , up one Pair of Stairs ; and there was 2 Locks upon the Trunk , neither of which were broke . I suppose I left the Key of my Compting-House in the Door , ( my Bunch of Keys being kept there ) and I imagine , she took them out , and opened the Trunk with my own Keys . I saw the Goods in the Trunk between 2 and 3 Months before I missed them ; and when I taxed her with taking them , she deny 'd it with Earnestness for 2 Hours , but upon my promising to be a Friend to her , and that I would not hurt it , she confessed - * * The Prosecutor was not allowed to proceed ; and another Witness afterwards offering to give an Account of what she had confessed to him , was likewise stopped ; because a Confession obtained on a Promise of Friendship , or by false Insinuations ( which was the latter Case ) ought not to be given in Evidence against a Prisoner . Robert Rhodes . This Ring I found amongst the rest of the Goods . Mr Demattos . 'T is mine , and has my Name in it . This Waistcoat is mine ; this Silver Lamp , and all these Things are mine . Mr Rhodes . I found these Goods by a Search Warrant , granted by my Lord Mayor , and backed by Colonel De Veil , at a Lodging taken for the Prisoner Rachael , at Mr Latham 's , by a few Woman , who sells Anchovies about the Streets . This Woman told me she believed the Goods were at this Lodging , and she shew 'd me the House ; but the Prisoner Rachael being gone out , we asked the Woman of the House , if any Goods had been brought there ? She told us , that a Trunk had been brought there , the Night before ; we seized it , and found all these Things in it . After this , we went with the Anchovy Woman in search of the Prisoner Rachael ; she carried us to Tower street , and there she called her out of a House to us , and I took her , and told her she was my Prisoner . She would not go with me till I shew 'd her my Staff , and then she came along quietly , and we took her before the Justice , who examined her ; and that Night she said , she knew nothing of the Robbery , but alledg 'd , that the other Prisoner ( Tobias Isaacs ) brought the Goods to her : He was not with us at that Time ? Prisoner Rachael , Ask my Master if he can swear I took them ? Mr Demattos . I do n't swear she took them : I swear she delivered me the Diamonds . The Prisoner ( Tobias ) is married to Rachael , and he used to come to her , till about 6 Months ago ; but he frequently beat her so miserably , that I forbid him my House , and I have not seen him for 6 Months ; tho ' I have heard he has been there within that Time . Richard Latham . I know both the Prisoners . On Tuesday the 17th of last Month , a Jew Woman , who serves me with Anchovies and Pickles , brought the Prisoner Rachael to my House , and told me she was distressed for a Lodging , and desired my Wife to let her lie a Night or two at our House . She told us , the Prisoner had been lock 'd up in a Room by her Husband , and that she had got through a Window , for fear of being murder 'd by him . My Wife was sorry for her , and gave her leave to lie with my Mother ; and the next Day , the Prisoner Tobias , and another Man , brought the Trunk to our House , - who that other Man was , I can not tell . When the Constable came to my House ; I happened to be at home : He said a Robbery had been committed , and I know there were several Parcels of Plate found in the Trunk , but I ca n't be particular to any one Thing , because I keep a Shop , and was out and in several Times . I believe I saw this Waistcoat taken out of it . I knew nothing of the Prisoner Rachael , before the Anchovy Woman brought her to our House , and after this , she fetch 'd Tobias to her , and told me he was her Brother ; she said , perhaps he could not come with her just then , therefore she desired me to give her a Direction in Writing how to find my House . William Winne . The Prisoner Tobias brought this Ring to my Shop , to be stretched for him , and I knew it to be Mr Demattos 's . I know nothing of the Woman Prisoner . Jacob Isaacs . I was Constable , and found the Goods at Latham 's House ; I know nothing else . Prisoner Tobias . Mr Demattos knows I was divorced from my Wife , and he sent to our Minister to know if it was a right Divorcement . Prisoner Rachael . The Goods were taken out of my Master 's House , by the Woman that sells Anchovies , and she carried them to Jacob Isaac 's House ; and when my Master gave me leave to go and see for them , I went thither , and he told me they were carried to Mr Latham 's . Mr Demattos . The Goods which Rachael herself delivered me back again , are worth about one hundred Pounds . - Lopez . I was the Person that Mr Demattos sent after Rachael , when she went to look after the Goods . I dodged her , to see if I could discover where she went , or find any of her Gang ; and I saw the Anchovy Woman come to her first , and afterwards Jacob Isaacs : upon which I went back and gave Mr Demattos notice , but when we returned the Women were both gone . Mr Demattos . I have heard that the Anchovy Woman used to come to my House ; and if I was to see her , I believe I should know her . One Witness for Rachael deposed that he had known her 20 or 22 Years ; he never had had any Dealings with her , but took her to be an honest Woman . Two others deposed much to the same purpose . Phineas Elias knew her when she lived in Mr Salvadore 's Family : he deposed , that she had lived there 3 Years very honestly . Two Jew Women deposed they had known her some Time , and never heard any Harm of her . Mr Salvadore deposed she had lived with him , at twice , near 6 Years , and that nothing was missing , during that Time . Mr Demattos . The Jewels were concealed in a Hair-Cap in the Trunk ; she took them out , and gave them to me . Tobias acquitted . Rachael , Guilty , Death . The Prosecutor recommended her to the Court for Mercy . 326. Solomon Isaacs was indicted for stealing 3 Dozen of horn spring clasp Knives , val.4 s. the Goods of Benjamin Horrocks , Samuel Hughes , and John Saint . May 30 . John Saint . On Friday the 30th of May last , the Prisoner came to our Shop in Birchen-Lane , and asked to see several sorts of Goods . I shewed him some , but by his Method of looking at them , I imagined he did not want to buy any , therefore I kept an Eye on him . And after he had looked out several sorts of Goods , he slipped a Paper of Pen-knives under his Coat , and told me he would just step cross the Street , and fetch some body to pay for what he had looked out . I asked him what he had got ? he told me , - nothing belonging to me , and immediately run out of the Shop . I was not able to take him myself ; but I called out to the next Witness to stop him ; he took him , and these are the Goods I saw him slip under his Coat . Giles Winkworth . On Friday the 30th of May , the Prisoner ran by me , and Mr Saint called out to me to stop him ; I stopped him , and he got away from me ; but perceiving a Parcel to drop from him , I ran after him again , and took him , and brought him to Mr Saint . I do n't remember what he said , in particular , when he was taken . Mr Saint . These are the Goods he stole out of my Shop . Thomas Church . I was Constable , and heard the Prisoner confess he took the Goods , before my Lord-Mayor . Prisoner . I went to the Shop and looked out 20 Shillings-worth of Goods for a Man that goes over Sea , which I laid by . Then I looked out these for myself , and asked the Gentleman if he had any Body to send home with me for the Money , for it was almost 7 o'Clock , and we Jews do n't touch Money after our Sabbath is begun : but the Gentleman told me , he would let me carry them home , and I might bring him the Money . So I went away , and a Man followed me and bid me come back . What must I come back for says I ? I am going to fetch a Man to pay for the Goods I have looked out : and as I was going to fetch him , the Parcel I had bought for myself dropped through a Hole I had in my Pocket , and they said I had stole them . Jacob Isaacs . I have known him 4 or 5 Years : I keep a Shop and he fetches his Necessaries from thence . and paid me very honestly . Moses Solomon . I have known him 5 or 6 Years , and have had Dealings with him for several Pounds . He always dealt honestly by me , and I never heard any harm of him . Samuel Levy . I keep a Chandler 's Shop , the Prisoner has been often in it , and I never missed any thing . Joseph Isaacs . I travel with him in the Country , and have gone with a Licence these 12 Years . I trusted him with my Goods , and never lost any Thing . Sarah Elias . I travel the Countries 28 Years ; I meet him very often : I lie in the best Inns , where things lie about , and he lies with me , and I never lose any thing . He lies in the same Inn with me , where the Silver and the Gold are about , and they lose nothing . - Isaacs , a Jew Woman . I went to the Gentleman 's House , because the Prisoner was Acquaintance with me , many Years ; and nothing but the Truth I speak . The Gentleman told me , he entrusted him with the Goods , and he was to give him 4 s. for them , but it being our Sabbath , he was to bring him the Money . Afterward he said , the Jews were all Rogues and Thieves , for he had entrusted Aaron Davis a great many Pounds , and he could hang an hundred Jews if it lay in his Power , because Aaron did not pay him . Mr Saint . I did not say any such thing to her , nor did she say any thing to me . 'T is improbable I should sell him the Goods for 4 s. for I charged them in the Indictment at 4 s. which is what they cost us . Besides , the Prisoner never saw these Goods , nor did he know what was in the Parcel , when he took it . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 327. Martha Grimes was indicted for stealing 5 Yards of printed Cotton , val.7 s. the Goods of Elizabeth Street . Jan.30 . Acquitted .

A hempen Sack , val.2 s.6 d. the Goods of John Kimber ; 1 ditto , the Goods of John Heffeild , and 1 ditto , the Goods of Joseph Strutt , June 27 . Arthur Findon . On the 26th of June I had Occasion to go out , in the Afternoon , and I came home about 8 o'Clock at Night . My Wife then told me the Uneasiness she had on her Mind concerning the Prisoner , for she said she had reason to believe the Prisoner carried out Flower and Bread in his Breeches ; she being uneasy , I resolved to get a Constable to attack him , as he went out with his Bread ; and the Constable was ordered to attend next Morning ; but he slept too long and did not come at the appointed Time . The Morning after this , my Wife was very uneasy , because ( she said ) the Prisoner could hardly walk about the Shop , he had got such a Bundle between his Legs ; so she called me down Stairs , and as he was going out with his Basket of Bread , as usual , she desired him to come back and set his Basket down . Accordingly he came back into the Shop , and seeing me there , he endeavoured to go backwards into the Bakehouse ; I followed him , and perceived he wanted to get something out of his Breeches ; but I took hold of him and brought him forwards , and he cried out for Mercy , and begged that I would not expose him . Not expose you ! Yes , says I , 't is high Time , - your Deeds have been in the dark long enough ; so a Neighbour coming in , we found a Quartern Loaf , of a pretty big Circumference , in his Breeches . I asked him , how he could be such a Rogue ? Why the Devil ( he said ) put him on to do it . We told him , we believed he had wronged us of an hundred Loaves that Way . He said , no , not above 7. and at last he brought it down to 4 . Then we sent for the Constable , who was to have come before , and told him we would get a Warrant to search his Lodgings for Flower : Upon which the Prisoner begged we would send him directly to the Counter ; that he might ( I suppose ) have Opportunity to send to his Wife . No ; we insisted upon carrying him before a Justice ; and then to moderate the thing , he thought proper to confess : but being pretty artful , and knowing he had to deal with one , who never was in any such an Affair before , he desired the Constable would go out of the Room , and that I would go with him , into a secret Place . I went with him into the Bakehouse , and he confessed the Flower , and said it was at his Lodgings . Indeed he did not say , what Flower , but he said the Flower was all at his Lodgings , except a little with which his Wife had made a Pudding . Well , but how much is there at your Lodgings ? - Indeed , ( says he ) 't is all there , and you shall have it all , except what my Wife has made a Pudding of . Upon this I took him before the Justice at Guildhall , and laid the Thing before him , about the Quartern Loaf in his Breeches , and for that , he was committed to Bridewell ; and when that was done , I desired I might have a Search Warrant that I might take the Goods he had confessed , but he told the Justice he would let me have them , and I might go and take my Goods : so after he was carried to Bridewell , the Constable , my 'Prentice and I , went to his Lodgings , and found a Sack and a half of Flower , which was upwards of 7 Bushels . One of the Sacks , in which was the Flower , I ca n't say positively that it was any Person 's with whom I deal ; but there was one , which belongs to Joseph Strutt , and I know it by the Mark . For Bakers are not accountable to the Meal-men for their Sacks , and 't is very common for them to lose a great many by the Roguishness of the Journey-men Bakers , and I know 't is Strutt 's Sack , for I deal with him for Flower . There was another Sack of John Heffeild 's , I deal with him for Oatmeal , and know it to be his by by the Mark . I am persuaded he took it out of my House . Edmund Cunningham . On the 27th of June , I was called to take the Prisoner in Custody , and while I was with him , he confessed he had wronged his Master of 6 Quartern Loaves . I saw the Loaf , which Mr Findon said he had taken out of his Breeches and he own 'd he had taken it from his Master . I heard nothing of the Flower , 'till he came to Guildhall , and then he confessed that he had Flower of his Master 's , but did not mention the Quantity . He was vastly desirons of having Pen and Ink , that he might send a Letter to his Wife , before he went to Guildhall . Anthony Tubby . The Prisoner confessed at Guildhall , that he had Flower of his Master 's , at his Lodgings in Rag Fair , I went with the Prosecutor thither , and there I saw 2 Sacks with Flower , and 2 without . Three of the Sacks I knew ; one was John Strutt 's ; one John Kimber 's , and one John Heffeild 's the Oatmeal Man 's . I ca n't say , that I know these Men had lost any Sacks , but I know they were their Sacks by the Marks . Henry Spurdle . When Mr Findon detected the Prisoner , he called me over to his House , and I saw the Quartern Loaf taken out of his Breeches , and then I was call 'd home . William Dunn depos 'd for the Prisoner , that 10 Months , ( or upwards ) ago , the Prisoner bought 2 Load of Flower of Roger Noland , and that he ( the Witness ) gave a Bond of 30 l. for the Payment of the Money for them ; and that afterwards he saw 20 Sacks of Flower in his House . He added , that he had been a Master Baker , but he could not say the Flower found in his Room , was Part of the Flower he had formerly bought . Eliz . Whatley , who lived with the Prisoner , when he was a Master Baker , depos 'd to the same Effect . Ann Lemon had known the Prisoner about 5 Years , and gave him a good Character . Mr. William deposed , that Flower will not keep 10 Months , especially if the Weather be hot , unless 't is sifted over after 't is lumped . If it was Kiln-dried it would keep some time longer , but no such Flower comes to Queen-Hithe . He farther deposed , that the Prisoner had a very bad Character . Guilty 8 d. half-penny . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 331. was indicted for stealing a Looking-Glass , val.10 s. a Callico Bed-quilt , val.2 s. and other Things the Goods of Sarah Burges .

She was a second time indicted for stealing a Pair of Linnen Sheets , val.4 s. and other things , the Goods of John Temple , in a Lodging let to her by the said Temple . Nov.14 . On both these Indictments it was proved , that the Goods mentioned in each were carried out of her Lodgings , by the Prisoner , and her Maid Ann Ellory , and pawn 'd at different Times and Places ; but Ellory , ( who was called by the Prosecutor on the first Indictment ) deposing , that they had been often pawn 'd and redeemed ; and that she verily believed the Prisoner intended to have replac 'd them again when she got Money , The Jury acquitted her on both Indictments . 332. Johanna Baker , alias Frowen , of Allhallows the Great , was indicted for stealing a Bed-quilt , val.10 s. and several other Things the Property of Thomas Low , April 24 . Mary Low . Thomas Low is my Husband ; but he being abroad , the Prisoner lived with me in a Room in Allhallows Lane , from whence I lost all the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment , the 24th of last April . I suspected the Prisoner , because there was no one else in the House ; and on her being taken up , she had my little Girl 's Knot upon her Head , - the same she has on now . I asked her , how she could be so wicked as to strip my Room ? She said I had entrusted her with them ; and would fain have made it but a Breach of Trust ; but I never entrusted her with my Goods.- I am a Pensioner of a Parish at the Three Cranes , and the Prisoner carried off my Goods , while I was at Market getting Bread for my Children . She was brought to me as a Lodger , on Sunday Night , and she stripped me of all I had on Thursday following , and left the Key of my Room under the Door . From that Time , I could not get Intelligence of her , till last Sunday was a fortnight , and then I heard where she was gone to lodge . Prisoner . She has sworn as much as she can , and now see whether the next can swear better.- A Curse light on her when I am gone - like an old Bitch as she is . Ann Wilkinson . The Prisoner having robbed me on the 13th of March , I went with Mrs Low to take her ; and we found her in Chick-Lane . She confessed she stole the poor Woman 's Goods , and that she had pawn 'd them at the upper End of Fee-Lane , by Saffron-Hill . Low . She carried us to Higginson 's , the Pawnbroker 's , at Saffron-Hill , and told us the Petticoat was there ; but the Quilt ( she said ) was sold outright to a Friend of her 's in Hand-Alley , Bishopsgate-street , for 10 s. and the Brass Lamp was at the same Place . Patience Bouchier . The latter End of April the Prisoner came to my House , and said she had had a Fit of Illness , and must dispose of some Goods , which her Grandmother had sent her out of the Country : She asked me if I wanted a Quilt . I told her I wanted one for the Children 's Bed , and she said she would fetch it out of pawn , and would shew it me . When I saw it , I told her it was too good for me , but she said , I should have it a Pennyworth ; for if I would not buy it , she would sell it to the Brokers in the Fields . My Maid then said , I might as well buy it as the Brokers , so I asked her what she must have for it . She said -12 s. I bid her 10 , and she took my Money ; and put her Hand into her Pocket , and pull 'd out a little Brass Lamp , telling me she would give me that into the Bargain . About 3 Weeks ago the Prosecutor came to enquire if I had not bought the Quilt ? I did not deny it , but delivered it to the Church-Wardens , who were the Prosecutors . Low . The Quilt she delivered them was mine . Jonathan Raven . I was charged with the Prisoner , and she owned she had stole the Goods , and some Pewter along with them , but the Pewter she said was sold , and we could not have it again . Prisoner . I ca n't say but something of what they have said is true , some Lies , and there 's an End o n't . Guilty . [ Transportation .

See summary . ] 334. Sarah Batchelor , of Christ Church , was indicted for stealing a Green Silk Purse , val.1 d. and 4 Half Guineas , and 10 s.6 d. in Silver , the Property of Mary Dalby , June 7 . Mrs Dalby . On Saturday the 7th of June , about 6 in the Evening , I went to Mrs Cole 's in Newgate Market for Butter , and from thence to Mr. Trueman 's , to buy some Bacon . I asked Miss Trueman if she could change me a 36 s. Piece ? She telling me she could , I pulled the Piece out of my Purse , and then laid my Purse down upon the Board , where they lay their Bacon , and from whence it could not fall . You never go into those Shops in the Market , so I stood on the outside , while she was changing my Money ; and in the mean time the Prisoner ran away with the Purse , in which was 4 Half-Guineas , a Diamond Ring , and some Silver . The Prisoner owns it was 8 s. and a Half-Crown ; I did not know she had it ; nor what Silver there was in it , 'till she mention 'd the particular Pieces ; for Mr Trueman 's Shop , and one of his Maids were searched , and I made a great deal of Enquiry after it , the Moment I missed it , but to no purpose . The Prisoner was taken up about a Week afterwards , and was carried to an Alehouse in Purple-Lane , where I saw her , and did not charge her with the Fact ; but when I had told the Gentlewoman of the House how I lost my Purse , she said , - Madam , you do not tell your Story right , - that wo n't do , - for I found it couragiously , and if there had been an hundred Guineas in it , I would have gone away with it . You do n't tell your Story right , ( says she ) for there was 4 Half-Guineas , and 8 s. and 2 Half-Crowns in it ; She found it couragiously , and I might do my worst . Thomas Rushworth . I received the Purse in which the Gentlewoman 's Money was contained , from James Ellis . James Ellis . After we had taken up the Party 's ( the Prisoner 's ) Mother , she told us , as how we ought to take up Mrs Piper . I went to Mrs Piper , and asked her if she had received a Purse from Sarah Batchelor ? She gave it me , and said the Prisoner would leave it with her ; and she was advised to keep it , in Hopes an Advertisement would come out about it . I received the Purse from Piper , and gave it to Rushworth . Sarah Piper . The Prisoner came one Night into my Shop in Church-Lane , St Giles 's , to light her Pipe ; and pulling out the Purse , she said , - the Money is all gone , will you have the Purse ? And down she flung it , at the same Time . The next Morning the Prisoner 's Mother came and asked me for it again . I keep a Barber 's Shop , and was then shaving two Men : - I gave her the Purse , and she presently said , -- Here , as my Daughter gave it you , take it and welcome ; but should you know it if you see it again . This is the Purse , I 'll take my Oath on it . Mrs Dalby This is the Purse which was taken from me at Mr Trueman 's . Prisoner to Piper . Tell the Gentlemen , you do n't know no hurt of me . Piper . No ; but she brought the Purse to me , and said , the Money that was in it , was left her by her Mother 's Uncle ; but afterwards she said she found it . Mary Jones . I know the Prisoner , - I can say nothing against her , nor for her . I keep a Chandler 's Shop in St Giles 's , and last Saturday was a Month , she and her Mother ( who lodges within three Doors of me ) came and had some Bread and Beer of me , and said she was afraid of losing what she had at home , so she bid the Prisoner give me the Purse , and then it would be safe . Accordingly the Prisoner gave me a green silk Purse with 3 Half-guineas and a Ring in it , and 3 Shillings in Silver . The Mother said , she had got a new Gown , new Shoes and Stockings now , - thank God for it ; telling me she had a Brother died and left her some Money . But some People being angry with me for taking it , and telling me they supposed the Girl had lain with some body and had robbed him , I delivered it to her again . This was the Purse , I know it again , - here is a Darn in it with green Silk . Mary Anniball . I keep a Butter-Shop , just by Mr. Trueman 's Bacon-shop : and I saw the Prisoner go by my Shop a Minute before the Purse was lost . On Sunday the 15th of June , I went with Mrs Dalby to the Prisoner . She told us she knew what we came about , - You come about the Purse that was lost in Newgate Market , - I wish ( say she ) I had found it , and I would have new cloathed myself . I knew her no otherways , than by singing Ballads about the Market . Mrs Jones . I have known the Prisoner six Months : She has been in the Neighbourhood longer . She has been several Nights in my Shop , early and late , and I received no Damage by her . The Prisoner in her Defence said she found it , and thought it belonged to her . Acquitted . 335.

He was farther charged with uttering and publishing the same , with intent to defraud Ann Beaver , & c . He was likewise charged as in the first and second Counts in the above Indictment , with intent to defraud William Wilks and Joseph Bush . Ann Beaver was called ; and the Counsel for the Defendant objected against her being sworn ; but it being the Opinion of the Court , that if she proved the Note to be false or forged , she was liable to pay , and therefore must be allowed to be a good Witness to prove the Note a forg 'd Note , tho ' she could not be a legal Witness to prove it a good one . Ann Beaver . Mr Wilks and Mr Bush are Malt Distillers , and are Partners in Trade , I believe . I was indebted to them 24 l.18 s. and more , for Spirits I had had of them ; and on the 8th of May , the Prisoner , who was their Clerk , came to me and desired to know if I wanted any Spirits . I told him yes , but I desired Mr Wilks to come and take the Money for that Tun I had had . He told me Mr Wilks was not well , and Mr Bush was out of Town . I said , if either of them would come , I would pay the Money ; but I refused to pay him , without an Order from Mr Wilks . On Saturday he came again , and said Mr Wilks was gone out to take an airing in a Coach , and could not come so far as my House . On Wednesday the 14th of May he came again , and said he had brought an Order from Mr. Wilks ; he delivered me this Order ; I paid him the Money , and he gave me a Receipt in my Pocket-Book . The Order was read , and it being in such general Terms , as to require the Aid of Parol Evidence to explain it and being without Direction to any particular Person ; and no mention made therein of what was to be paid , it was too uncertain , and general , to come within the Penal Statute of the VIIth of his present Majesty , The Jury therefore acquitted the Prisoner . 337.+ Joseph Baxter , of St Butolph Aldgate , was indicted for stealing 73 Thirty-six-Shilling-Pieces,13 Guineas,3 Moidores,2 Three Pound Twelve Shilling Pieces , and 4 l.19 s. the Money of Joseph Stephens , in his Dwelling House , June 21 . The Counsel for the Prosecution having opened the Charge , the Witnesses were called . Mr Stevens . The Prisoner ( Joseph Baxter ) is my Apprentice , and had lived with me about 4 Years . On the 21st of June ( Saturday ) about 8 o'Clock in the Morning , my Wife and I being in the Chamber , where the Bureau was in which I kept my Money , I counted over my Cash , and settled it ; it amounted to 176 l.- After I had so done , I locked my Bureau and came down into my Shop . About 12 at Noon , a Woman having bought a Gold Ring , asked me to give her Gold for 6 Guineas-worth of Silver . I told it over , and finding it all good , I swept it into my Apron ; carried it up , and put it into my Bureau , and took out 6 Guineas for it . My Cash was all safe then , and I locked up the Bureau and came down Stairs . About 5 in the Evening a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood sent me a Moidore to change ; I went up Stairs and changed it and found my Money still safe : and having locked it up in the Bureau , and put the Key in my Pocket , I came down again into my Shop . About 8 that same Evening , I carried home a Clock to Mile-end ; had my Wife been at home , I should have gone sooner . My Son Philip went with me , and carried the Clock , and we returned from thence at a quarter after 9 : it was a little before 10 when I got home , and I found my Wife was come home . I went to Supper with my Family , and went out no more that Night . I went to Bed at 11 o'Clock , and the Prisoner was not then come home . My Wife sat up for him till 12 , then every Body went to Bed . The Prisoner came home a little while afterwards , and I called up my Son Joseph to let him in . As he went up Stairs , I called to him ; and asked him , if he was not ashamed to keep such Hours ? He made no Answer , but went up Stairs to Bed . In the Morning my Wife got up between 7 and 8 , and about 8 I got up , and went to my Bureau , to empty my Pockets of the Cash I had taken the Day before . But coming to my Bureau , I found it slack and open ; and taking hold of the Lid , I found the Lock had been drawn back . I I remember I lock 'd it at 5 o'Clock over Night , and finding it thus , I was surpriz 'd ; and immediately clapp 'd my Hand to the Drawer where I had put my Cash , and found myself stripp 'd of all , and not one Farthing of my 176 l. left . Upon this I ran to my Wife , - What shall I do ! My dear , what shall I do ! I have lost 176 L . Since 5 o'Clock last Night . She went up Stairs with me , and I shew 'd her my empty Drawers , at which she was in as great a Surprize as myself . This was on Sunday Morning , and the Prisoner was then in the Shop , cleaning his Buckles , and I being in so great a Surprize , to be sure did not speak softly ; yet he took no manner of notice , but while I went up to shew my Wife the Bureau , he went out of Doors . I sent after him , and found him at the Barber 's ; and carried him to Gillispy 's Lodgings , who is a Person that worked in my House . We found Gillispy in Bed with his Wife ; for he works with me , and lodges in my House all the Week , and I give him Leave to go home to his Wife on Saturday Nights . I made Gillispy get up . and I carried them both home to my House ; told them of my Loss , and begged of them , if they had any Regard for me or themselves , to make a Discovery of the Money , for I was positive 't was all safe at 5 o'Clock over Night . I argu 'd with them two Hours , and told them the Danger of exposing themselves to the Publick ; but I could get nothing out of them . About 12 o'Clock , I charged a Constable with them both , and searched Gillispy 's Lodgings , but found nothing . The next Morning they were carried before the sitting Alderman at Guildhall , who after he had examined them both , discharged Gillispy , and committed Baxter the Prisoner . My Family consists of my Wife and 3 Children , one of which went out with me , the other 2 I left at home with the Prisoner : We have no Maid Servant , nor any other Men Servants but the Prisoner and Gillispy : and he ( Gillispy ) when I went out , followed me at my Heels , for when I was got to Whitechappel Mount , there 's a little Field goes round by the Gun , and there we met one another ; so he must have come out of my House but a Minute or 2 after me . I live but a little on this side Whitechappel Bars , and it can not be half a Mile to the Place where I met him . I asked him where he was going ? He told me he was going to one Mr Wade 's , to see if he could get a Crown which he ow 'd him . I told him he might come next Day and take a Dinner with me , and so we parted . [ Mr Stevens mentioned the particular Pieces of Money , and the Quantity he had lost , as charged in the Indictment ] . The Prisoner is about 19 Years old . He was about 15 or 16 when I took him , and he had served me about 4 Years . I had but 2 Servants , the Prisoner and Gillispy ; and Gillispy has less Time to serve than the Prisoner . For he married a Wife , and left my Service , intending to get into other Business ; but that failing , and he being sick , his Wife came to me , and begged I would have some Compassion upon him . Accordingly , I reliev 'd him , and ordered an Apothecary to asist him ; upon which he promised to serve me out the rest of his Time . Once a Week he begs Leave to lie at his Wife 's Lodgings , - on Saturday Night ; and he generally comes home on Sunday Night , or Monday Morning . The Witness was asked if he had found the Prisoner honest.- As to that I ca n't say , - I ca n't positively prove any thing ; but this Question obliges me to say , I have had a strong Suspicion to the contrary ; for about 2 Years ago , I missed 20 Guineas out of my Cash out of my Bureau , and my wife and I were very uneasy about it , and the Prisoner at that Time absconded for a Month . Prisoner . Did you charge me with it ? Mr Stevens . I did not directly charge him with the Fact ; but I said I had lost Cash , and a little before that I lost a Watch ; I did not know what my Loss was ; and I told him it looked Suspicious , and I thought it was an imprudent Thing for him to leave his Service after I had had that Loss . When he came again , he made me a great many Promises , that he would be a good Boy , and mind his Business , and that induced me to take him again ; as I could not prove any thing upon him . Indeed while he absconded he sent me a Threatning Letter , intimating , that if I did not hold my Tongue , he 'd make me . Mrs Stevens . I came home about half an Hour after 8 , after my Husband was gone out , and I asked my Son Joseph ( one of the Children who were left at Home ) where his Father was gone ? - He said , - to Stepney Green , to put up a Clock , and that he had been gone out about half an Hour . Joe , says I , where are the Keys of the Chamber ? for I had lock 'd the Chamber Door where the Bureau was , before I went out , and had laid the Keys upon Mr Stevens 's Work-board in the Shop . Upon my asking my Son for the Keys , Joe Baxter the Prisoner said , - They are o'top of the Board , give them your Mother ; and accordingly the child gave them me . I did not ask any one in particular for the Keys , but in general said - Where are the Keys of the chamber ? I am sure the Door was fast locked when I went out . After my Son had given me the Keys , I went up Stairs , and bid the Prisoner bring up the Shew-Glass from the Door ; and as I put the Key in the Door , the Door went open without unlocking . This surprized me at first , but I thought , - perhaps Mr Stephens might have been up , since I went out , so after he had brought up the Shew-Glass , I locked the Door and put the Keys in my Pocket , and they were never cut of my Pocket , 'till I went to bed . When the Prisoner had set down the Shew Glass , I followed him down Stairs , and he desired he might shut up the Shop , because he wanted to go out to buy a new Hat . He went out about 9 o'Clock , and from that Time , to my Husband 's coming home , no one had been in the House . He came home about 12 o'Clock , and one of the Children let him in . Couns . Did he use to keep such Hours ? Mrs Stevens . Yes ; Eleven was a very good Hour , - many Nights he has not come home at all . My Husband and I lay in the Room where the Bureau stood , and no Soul could come into it , - No Creature came into the House the next Morning , for I unchained the Street-Door myself , to take in some Milk . Couns . You laid the Keys upon the Board yourself , - before you went out . Mrs Stevens . Yes ; and there were 3 or 4 Keys together : for my Husband having lost Money before , and People having said , - when a Man and his Wife has Access to it , nothing ( with certainty ) can be made out , and that I might take it , as well as another , I resolved never to go to the Bureau again . Couns . Upon the Oath you have taken , had you been at the Bureau , from the Time your Husband locked it , to the Time he missed the Money ? Mrs Stevens . No , as God knows my Heart . Couns . You left the Keys , ( you say ) upon the Boards ; is that the Place you usually leave them in ? Mrs Stevens . Yes ; when I am going out , my Husband desires me to leave them , else he ca n't get at his Cash , if he should want it . I went out about 6 , and threw them down upon his Board . I returned home about half an Hour after 8 , and found my 2 little Boys at home . My Son Philip was gone with his Father . Joseph Stevens . I am almost 15 years and a half old . Couns . Do you know the Nature of an Oath ? Stevens . It is in my Catechism that I must not bear false Witness against my Neighbour , - I was at home that Saturday Night , when my Father went out ; Gillispy went out about 3 Minutes after my Father , and only the Prisoner , I and my Brother Samuel , were left at Home . Mr Stevens . Samuel is about 11 Years old . Stevens . My Mother came home about half an Hour after my Father was gone . Couns . Between the Time of your Father 's going out , and your Mother 's coming home , who came into the House ? Stevens . Only a Workwoman who brought a Dozen of Spoons , which my Father had bespoke . She gave her Goods into the Shop , and did not stay 3 Minutes . She never went up Stairs ; but the Prisoner did : For after my Father was gone out , he cleared away his Work board , and told me he was going up Stairs to black the Shoes . He was above Stairs half an Hour , and I staid in the Shop to look after it . He was above Stairs half an Hour before my Mother came home . Couns . When your Father went out , where were the Keys left ? Stevens . Upon my Father 's Work board . The Prisoner was come down Stairs before my Mother came in ; as soon as she came in , she asked for the Keys of the Chamber , and the Prisoner said , - they are upon the Board.- Joe , Give them your Mother . I am sure no body went up Stairs while my Father and Mother were out , but he . Couns . What Time of the Night did the Prisoner come in ? Stevens . The Clock had struck 12 ; my Father called me up , to let him in , and I heard him speak to the Prisoner as he went up Stairs . Couns . During the Time that your Father and Mother were out , had you or your Brother been up Stairs ? Stevens . No ; nor near the Stairs . Couns . Did you take Notice of the Keys lying on the Board when your Mother went out ? Stevens . I did not take Notice of that : but my Mother whenever she went out laid the Keys there . Charles Gillispy . I am Mr Steven 's Apprentice . I remember the Saturday Night when he went to put up the Clock ; but I did not see him go out ; for I work above Stairs in the Garret , and was there when he went out , but I overtook him at Whitechappel Mount . He was gone out before I came down from Work , which was about 8 o'Clock . Couns . Was you in your Master 's Room that Saturday ? Gillispy . No ; I was not . My Master came to me on Sunday Morning , and I went home with him : He did not tell me what his Business was , 'till I came to his House . Couns . Do you know what Time your Master went out ? Gillispy . No : I had been at work in the Garret , and nobody had been with me all Day , but the children backwards and forwards , and the Prisoner . I was from 6 in the Morning to 8 at Night in the Garret ; then I came down and went out ? Couns . What Place does the Prisoner clean his Shoes in ? Gillispy . In one of the Garrets , just by the Place where I work : I ca n't tell whether he came up to clean his Shoes before I went out , - I believe I should have seen him if he had . His usual Time of cleaning them is after 8 o'clock . Couns . As you come down from the Garret , do you pass by your Master 's chamber ? Gillispy . Yes ; and if it had been open , I should have seen it ; but I did not take any particular Notice of it . Couns . to Mr Stevens . When you went up the last Time , about 5 o'clock , did you lock your chamber door ? Mr Stevens . When I went up at that Time , I found my Wife , and a Gentlewoman reading the Exposition of a chapter in the Romans , out of Barkit . Gillispy was then in the Garret , and the Prisoner and my 2 children were below . Acquitted . 338.

Frances Watson . The Prisoner came yesterday Morning , into Mrs Ward 's Shop , ( in Princes-Street , Leicester Fields , ) about 8 o'clock ; 't is a Linnen Draper 's Shop : She asked for Cottons ; I shewed her several , but they did not please her , she wanted Purples ; when the Purples were shewn her , they would not do for her ; and then I pull 'd down some Linnens , and shew 'd her one , which I said was a very pretty Thing . She neither said she lik 'd it , or disliked it ; but only that she must have larger Patterns , and she would come again by and by , and bring her Cousin with her , who had been at our Shop ( she said ) and had bought a Gown ; and so she went out . I turn 'd up the Goods I had shewn her , and missed this Piece ; upon which which I came quickly round the Counter , and overtook her at the next Door , and told her she had got something . No , she had not , she said ; but I turned back her Cloak , and saw this Linnen upon her . I told her 't was ours : she said it was not ; I knew it , and took it from her ; then she would have got away , but I held her , and got her back to the Shop ; after which she was carried before a Justice , where she confessed the Fact , and said she did it through Poverty .

She was a 2d Time indicted for stealing a suit of Cambrick laced Headcloaths , val.40 s. a Necklace , val.6 d. and other Things of Value , the Goods of Lydia Seymour , in her Dwelling-House , June.25 . Mr Pennington . On Saturday the 21st of June , I lost half a Dozen of Shirts : On the 25th , several Pieces , and a Sleeve were found in the Cellar under a Stove . This made me imagine , the Prisoner had taken the rest : so I got a Candle , and searched the Cellar , and odd Places below , and twice she blew the Candle out . And there being a Trunk in the House , which as the Prisoner pretended , belonged to another Woman , we wanted to see it opened , and asked the Prisoner for her Keys . She took them out of her Pocket , but none of them would open it ; upon which we borrowed a Key , and got it open ; and in the Trunk we found a Shirt sleeve , and several Pieces ; and afterwards a Suit of Headcloaths of Mrs Seymour 's , and several other odd things of mine , as a Shirt , and a Handkerchief . The Goods which we found of Mrs Seymour 's , in the Trunk , were the Headcloaths , several Pillowbiers , Aprons , and Handkerchiefs ; and I am sure they were found in the Prisoner 's Trunk , and she was present when we opened it . Mrs Seymour . About 3 or 4 Days after the Prisoner came to live with me , I fell sick , and kept my Bed for some Time . The first Day I came down into the Kitchen , after my Illness , I was asked for a Pattern of a pretty Mob ; so I sent her with my Keys up Stairs , for a Bundle of rough Linnen ; and I missed out of it , a suit of Head-cloaths . This gave me a Suspicion of the Prisoner ; and some body telling me , there was foul Towels under the Stoves , in the Cellar , I searched there , and found a Sleeve and some Pieces of Mr Pennington 's Shirts . Then , says I , - here is a Trunk which she brought in , with other Folk 's Things , I 'll see what is in it ; so I opened the top part , and the bottom she opened herself , and there we saw a great many things of Mr Pennington 's and mine . There was a Dimitty Petticoat , a pair of Cambrick Ruffles , Pillowbiers , and a great many Things more . I taxed her with the Headcloaths , the Moment I missed them , and she said , - Madam , do n't fret yourself , - you 'll find them again . I value the Headcloaths at 40 s. and have a Ruffle of the same in my Pocket . I ca n't really say what they are worth , for I bought them abroad , - in Flanders , cheaper than I could have done here . I ca n't say I lost the rest of the things at the same Time I lost the Headcloaths , nor that she took them all at a Time . There is a Napkin of mine which her Mantua-Maker brought me , and said the Prisoner gave it her to line the Body of a Gown . This is the Lace belonging to the Head , it was completely made , but she hath ripped it up . I take on me to say it was worth 40 s. - Lasieur . Mrs Seymour and Mr Pennington sent for me , and I found they had charged the Prisoner with taking the things , and they made a Noise to her about it . She fell down crying and roaring ; and owned she had taken them . While Pennington and Seymour were gone up Stairs , I said , - Mary , what makes you guilty of such Things as these ? Master Lasieur , said she , the Devil tempted me to it . And why says I , should the Devil tempt you to steal what is not your own . The Prisoner called a Witness who had been Mrs Seymour 's Servant , and she deposed , that all the Neighbours gave the Prisoner the Character of a very honest Person , before she went to live at Seymour 's House ; and she gave her the Character of a bad Woman . Another deposed to the same Effect . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 351.

The Prisoner came into 'Squire Merrick 's Barn at Southall , last Midsummer Day at Night . and took away a Pair of Sheets , and two Shirts . He took all the Things I had from me . One of my Shirts I found upon his Back ; the other he said he had pawn 'd , and the Constable and I went and found it according to his Directions . When he was before the Justice he had nothing to say , - only he told the Justice he bought the 2 shirts of a Woman , but he did not know her Name , nor where to find her . Prisoner . And do you swear to 2 Shirts again ? Warren . Yes . William Rouse . I saw the Prisoner come over the Gate with a Bundle on his Back , but I do n't know what was in it . I was with Warren before the Justice , and there he swore to his things . Thomas Gibbs , the Constable . The Prisoner owned when he was taken , he had a Shirt of Warren 's , which was taken off his Back before the Justice . Another he said he had left at Mrs Weedon 's , an Alehouse-Keeper , and there we found it . Warren . And they were both mine . Prisoner . 'T is a d - n 'd Lye , - I ca n't talk . Guilty .

I bought a Bed of the Prisoner , which Mrs Butt has had again : I gave her 16 s. for it . Butt . Sir Edward Hill ordered her to let me have it again . The Quilt,2 Blankets , this Sheet , and the Curtains , I had from John Tawn , in Peter's-Street . Another Witness . The Prisoner desired me to fetch the Quilt out of Pawn , and told me , if she and I could agree for Price , I should have it . If we could not agree , she was to pay me the Money I laid down at the Pawnbroker 's , the next Day . I fetched it out for 3 s. and Butt own 'd it . Prisoner .
