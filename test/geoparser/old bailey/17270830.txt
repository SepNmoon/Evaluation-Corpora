The Prosecutor being asked why he did not lay these Things to the Prisoner 's Charge sooner , the Fact being committed in March last , and he not making it known till August , said , That he being unacquainted with the Ways of the Town , and being a Stranger to the Law on Such Occasions , he said nothing of it till he heard the Prisoner was taken up for an Offence of the like Nature : When he told the Landlord of the Guy Earl of Warwick , of the Indecencies the Prisoner had offered to him ; who acquainted some of the Gentlemen with it that belong to the Reformation of Manners .

I had another Friend of mine there , a Man , who went into another Room with a Friend of her 's , a Woman , & c. before my Friend went out of the Room I shew 'd him my Watch , and when he came in again I had lost it ; I can not swear that the Prisoner took it , but we had been very close together , and she had an Opportunity and more than that , that old Bawd Sarah Mullenux came just in at the Door , and my young Whore Sarah Martin , put something into her Hand , which I do believe was my Watch , for I immediately mist it , and calling my Friend we search 'd Martin , but did not search Mullenux , for she 's an old Woman . Sarah Martin thus made her Defence , After the Prosecutor had pickt me up , he went with me to my Mother Mullenux , and promised he would give me something to please me , I asked him how , he said , on my Back ; so I took him at his Word , and we were very loving & c. when he pretented he had lost his Watch , he bid me strip naked , and I said with all my Soul , and I did so , but he could not find it , tho ' he search 'd - Ann Coleman depos 'd , That she knew the Prosecutor to be a common Whoremonger , and had that Night pawn 'd his Watch at a Bawdy House that is noted ( or ought to be so ) by the Name of honest Tom Powel 's in Wine-Office-Court in Fleet-street ; to which the Prosecutor said , it was true , he had been at the Bawdy-house and had a Woman before he went to the other , but he had only pawned the Case of the Watch , and not the Watch itself : Upon the Whole it appeared to the Court , that the Prisoner and the Prosecutor were all Persons of a very bad Charactor , acting without a Regard to Truth or Honesty ; but the Fact not appearing plain the Jury acquitted them .

This gave the Court an Insight into the Truth , and occasioned such a strict Enquiry to be made in the Affair , as made it evident that there was no Robbery either designed or committed ; but Martha Cambell in Consideration of her former Familiarity with the Prosecutor , and his using her with Contempt lately , was grown outrageous ; and Anthony Lutford being her present Friend , ( if there is such a Things as Friendship in a vicious Course of Life ) had assisted her in insulting the Prosecutor : It appear 'd that the Prosecutor and Anthony Lutford , had not only been familiar Acquaintance , but the Prosecutor had employ 'd him as a Solicitor , and had reposed a great deal of Confidence in him , instrusting him to get in his Debts , and other Affairs of Consequence , but had of late uttered some spightful Words against the Prisoner , on occasion of his being employed in a Suit of Law against him ; which Circumstances being compar 'd , the Court lookt upon it only as a Quarrel , and the Jury brought them in Not guilty .
