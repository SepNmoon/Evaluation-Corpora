Katharine Hascoat depos 'd , That she being a Servant to the Lady Thorold , saw the Plate mentioned in the Indictment , put up in a Trunk , and sent to Mr. Sentement 's there to be kept whilst her Lady remain 'd in the Country . That she saw the Trunk lock 'd , seal 'd , and corded , and deliver 'd the Key to her Lady . Thomas Dawlin , depos 'd , That he being an Apprentice to M. Sentement , to long whom the Prisoner was a Coachman , the Prisoner had for a long Time endeavour 'd to perswade him to be Confederate in robbing his Master ; that at length , with frequent Importunities , he was prevail 'd with to a Complyance . That on the Day mentioned in the Indictment , he the Prisoner , took the Opportunity of Mr. Charlwood 's , and the Maid 's being Abroad , and with false Keys opened several Doors , and took out the Plate from the Lady Thorold 's Trunk , and the Money from his Master 's Desk , and brought down his Hands full of Guineas . That he went up Stairs a second Time , and brought down more Plate , and then broke open his Master 's Till , out of which he took a broad Piece , a Guinea , a half Guinea , and some Silver ; that they shar 'd the Money , and the Prisoner hid the Plate in the Still-Room . That in the Morning betimes , after this , he got up , and pull 'd out the Frame of the Cellar Window , and then ry 'd this Deponent down in his Bed to put a Colour on the Knavery , as if it was done by common Housebreakers ; after which , he went up Stairs , and fir 'd off a Pistol , to amuse the Neighbourhood , and Alarum the Family , with the Apprehension of Thieves and Robbers . That some Time after , none of them being in the least suspected , and the Prisoner 's Money exhausted , he consulted with this Deponent about melting down the Silver , and accordingly they bought a melting Pot , and after melting it , ran it upon the Hearth , and the Prisoner dropping it afterwards in the Dirt , perswaded this Deponent to go with him to a Silversmith , to vouch for him , That he see him find it in the Dirt ; but the Silversmith being cautious , stopp 'd the Plate , and very honestly , and industriously discover 'd the Scene of Iniquity ; and upon the first Appearance of a Discovery , this Deponent made a full Confession , and was admitted an Evidence . Mr. Weaks the Silversmith corroborated the latter Part of this Deposition , in relating every Circumstance of their coming to him with the Plate , his Suspicion , and their being apprehended . Several Gentlemen of Worth appear 'd for his Character , who gave him an extraordinary good Word , he having serv 'd some of them as a Coachman , others as a Footman , and all to the best of their Knowledge , as a faithful Servant ; but notwithstanding his former Character , the Fact appear 'd plain , upon which the Jury found him Guilty . Death . William Hales , Goldsmith , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for a Misdemeanor , in forging and counterfeiting an Indorsment on a forg 'd and counterfeit Note , on which were the following Words and Figures , 800 l. pay to the Order of - Value receiv 'd , Samuel Edwards . The Council for the King open 'd to the Court the Nature of the Offence , and the Heinousness of the Crime , for which the Prisoner stood indicted , for first , forging a counterfeit Note of 800 l. made payable to Samuel Edwards , Esq ; and sign 'd Robert Hales , and indorsing it with the Name of Samuel Edwards , which Note he drew upon a Paper he had obtain 'd of Mr. Edwards , under the Pretence of a frank 'd Cover , in which he said , he should send News into the Country , and thus he abused the Courtesy and good Nature of Mr. Edwards , by cutting off the upper Part of the Paper , which contain 'd the Directions and drawing a Note , so as the Name Samuel Edwards , and the Word Free , should serve his Purpose in the Indorsment , and then borrowing , and receiving 450 l. of Mr. Robert Harl , on the Gredit of the said indors 'd Note . Thomas Maddox depos 'd , That he being Servant to Mr. Edwards , had observ 'd that for some Years past Mr. Hales had several frank 'd Covers of his Master Mr. Edwards , and that in July last , Mr. Hales 's Servant came to his Master 's , with six blank Covers , and desir 'd in the Name of his Master , that those Covers might be frank 'd without a Superscription , which his Master refus 'd , he always writing the Superscription , as well as the Word Free and his Name ; he further said , That he never knew his Master give any promissary Notes on any Occasion whatsoever . The six frank Covers being shew 'd to this Deponent , he said , He did believe those were the very same Covers that Robert Hudson , Mr. Hales 's Man , brought to his Master , to be frank 'd in July last . Ann Clark depos 'd , That in July last , Mr. Hales 's Servant , brought a Letter for her Master , who was than in the Country , and deliver 'd it to her , which Later being produc 'd in Court , it appear 'd , That Mr. Hales finding Mr. Edwards had refus 'd to frank his Letters without writing the Directions himself , had sent three several Directions in this Letter , for the six Franks ; and that when her Master came Home , she deliver 'd this Letter , or Note of Directions to him , and he then said , he would not frank Mr. Hales 's Letters any more ; for he had both a Brother and Nephew , who were Members of the House of Commons , and could do it for him . Mr. Philip Booth depos 'd , That he was very well acquainted with Mr. Hales 's Hand Writing , and did verily believe he wrote this Note of Directions . The Contents were as follows . To John Prat , Esq ; Bristol . To Mr. Levett . Huntington . To Stephen Mitford , Esq ; Exeter . It was likewise observ 'd , That the crouded o , and the Addition , were different Ink from the F , and the Name Samuel Edwards ; and that at the Top of the Note , there were the Bottom of some Letters , which were suppos 'd to be the Part of the Direction of a Letter . A Remark was likewise made , That it is not the common Custom to write for Val . received , but Val . receiv 'd ; but as the Word Free could not be well ras 'd out to serve the Purpose , it was made For , though done so bunglingly , as it might easily be discover 'd . Mr. Spicer depos 'd , That he has been a Clerk , and wrote for Mr. Edwards , above twenty Years ; that he was acquaintted very well with Mr. Edwards 's Affairs in general , and never knew , or heard of any Dealings he had with Mr. Hales , and the Note being shew 'd to him , he said , The Name Samuel Edwards , and the F , he did believe to be Mr. Edwards 's Writing , and he made the same Observations on the other Part of the Indorsment as was made before . Mr. Braithwait depos 'd , That Mr. Hales brought a Note to him ( as mentioned before , being an Order from Mr. Harl , to pay Mr. Hales 450 l. which Note or Order was read in Court ) and desir 'd he would give him two Notes , one for 250 l. payable to Mr. Hales , and one for 220 l. payable to Charlton Thurp , and this being above the Sum mentioned in Mr. Harl 's Order , Mr. Hales gave him a Note of 20 l. to make up the Sum . Mr. Harl depos 'd , That on the 13th of June last , Mr. Hales brought a Note to him , of 800 l. ( which being produc 'd in Court , appear 'd to be the same for which he stood indicted ) and desir 'd he would lend him 450 l. and upon the Credit of this Note , he drew upon his Goldsmith , to pay Mr. Hales 450 l. which Mr. Hales promis 'd to pay in a few Days , and left the Note in Pledge , till it should be paid , which Note had been in his Hands ever since , and had not been alter 'd but was directly as he receiv 'd it of Mr. Hales . That when Mr. Hales was taken up in September last , for counterfeiting a Note of 6400 l. he went to his Goldsmith , and found that Mr. Hales had paid to him and Comp . 460 l. on the very Day he was taken up , an Account of which being found in a Memorandum , when Mr. Hales was secur 'd at the Bank , the Money was attach 'd , and he suspecting Mr. Hales to have counterfeited this Note , went and found out Mr. Edwards , who was surpriz 'd at the Sight of it , acknowledging he did believe the Name Samuel Edwards on the Indorsment was his own Hand Writing ; but for the other Part , it appear 'd to him a Forgery ; the Note being produc 'd it was read by Order of Court , viz . I promise to pay to Samuel Edwards , Esq ; or Order , the Sum of eight hundred Pounds , three Months after Date , for Value receiv 'd . May the 13th 1728. Robert Hales And on the Backside indors 'd thus : 800 l. pray pay to the Order of - For the Value receiv 'd . Samuel Edwards . And here it was observ 'd , That the Word For , was made out of the Word Free , as wrote on a Cover by Mr. Edwards for Mr. Hales , the o being crouded between the F and r , and one of the ee 's at the End of Free , made to serve for the contracted the , and the other e taken into the Beginning of the y . The Council for Mr. Hales observ 'd , That Mr. Harl had his 450 l. paid him again , and therefore concluded , That Mr. Hales could not be brought under the Imputation of defrauding him ; but this was answer 'd , That the 450 l. which Mr. Hales paid to Mr. Harls Goldsmith , was not paid as a Discharge of that Debt , but placed to accompt , Mr. Hales being at that Time indebted in other Sums to Mr. Harl , and an Instance given . That if it had been otherwise , his Crime would have been the same , that is , If a Thief steals Goods out of a House , and does not keep , but bring them back , it is still a Felony , the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . Mr. Hales was a second Time indicted , on a Statute of the 33 Harry the 8th , for obtaining Money by false Tokens from Robert Harl . This being the 450 l. mentioned on the foregoing Indictment , which Mr. Hales defranded Mr. Harl of , under false Colours and Pretences , with the counterfeit Note of 800 l. drawn upon Robert Hales , and indors 'd Samuel Edwards , the same Witnesses were call 'd over again , and the Fact appearing plain , the Jury found him Guilty . [ Pillory . See summary . ] William Hales and Thomas Kinnersley ( a Clergyman ) were indicted for forging and counterfeiting a Note , bearing Date the 16th of August 1727 , for 1260 l. payable to Samuel Edwards , Esq ; or Order , sing 'd Thomas Kinnersley , and indors 'd Samuel Edwards . The Council for the King opened to the Court , that the Prisoners being Persons of ill Fame , and having in their Custody a false forged and counterfeit Note , did publish the same Fraudulently for a true Note , knowing it to be false and counterfeit , and thereby intending to cheat and defraud Samuel Edwards , Esq ; and other his Majesty 's Subjects , with the said forg 'd and counterfeit Writing . That it was a melancholy Scene to see a Clergyman in that Habit Mr. Kinnersley appearing at the Bar in a Clergyman 's Habit , arraign 'd for such unjust Proceedings , in being concern 'd with Mr. Hales , in contriving counterfeiting and forging this Note , for which they stood indicted . That the good Nature of Mr. Edwards , in giving frank Covers to Mr. Hales , had given them this Opportunity to counterfeit a Note , and contrive Mr. Edward 's Name to the Indorsment . That the Hand Writing in the Body of the Note was Mr. Kinnersley 's . That the Paper on which the Note was drawn , appear 'd to have been cut , or torn from some Writing , the Bottom of several Letters being visible at the Top of the Note , and the Note cut , and as it were indented to give the more Room for the Note to he wrote on , that the Word Free , as in all Probability , and even Appearance , was upon the Note , was chang 'd to the Word For , to serve the Purpose of the Prisoners . That the Ink and in the o , which as in the other Note was crouded between the F and the r , and the additional Writing were much blacker than the Name Samuel Edwards . That Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kinnersley , if they knew one another , never had any Dealings together , nor could there be any Foundation , for a Note of such Consequence , as that of 1260 l. That Mr. Kinnersley had confess 'd his Writing all the Body of the Note . That they had so managed the Affair , as to get the Sum of 750 l out of one Mr. Bird , upon the Credit of this counterfeit Note , which they deposited in his Hands . That when Mr. Bird demanded the Money of Mr. Kinnersley , he said , he was a poor undone Man , and Mr. Bird must apply to Mr. Edwards , who indors 'd it , and was a wealthy Man . That when Mr. Kinnersley was carry 'd before Sir Richard Hopkins , under Confusion , he seem 'd minded to make a Confusion , but was hinder 'd by an Attorney , when he so far retracted , as even to deny his own Hand Writing . Thomas Maddox depos 'd , as in the first Indictment , That Mr. Hales , who liv 'd opposite his Master Mr. Edwards , in Dukestreet Westminster , had for some Years past frequently got frank 'd Covers for Letters of his Master , & c. Ann Clark likewise repeated her former Evidence , That the Servant of Mr. Hales deliver 'd her a Note , in which was contain 'd three Directions to John Prat , Esq : of Bristol , Mr. Levet of Huntington , and Stephen Mitford , Esq ; at Exeter , her Master having before refus 'd to Frank Letters without he wrote all the Directions . Mr. Spicer likewise confirm 'd his former Evidence . Mr. Bird depos 'd , holding the Note , for which Mr. Hales and Mr. Kinnersley were indicted , in his Hand , That on the 20th of March last , Mr. Hales brought the Note to him , and on the Credit of that Note , and a promissary Note of his own , he lent him 750 l. in Bank Notes . That on the 3d of April following , Mr. Hales brought him 400 l. and indors 'd it on his own promissary Note ; but he never paying him any more , he sent his Attorney , Mr. Tompkins , to Mr. Kinnersley , to demand the Money . That Mr. Kinnersley came to him , and own 'd the Note , saying , it was his own Hand Writing ; but how it came to be indors 'd by Mr. Edwards , he could not tell . That he was a ruin 'd and undone Man , and must make himself over to the Fleet , if the Money was demanded of him , and that Mr. Edwards who indors 'd the Note , was a Man of Substance ; that the Note had been all the while since the 20th of March in his Custody , without any Alterations : The Contents were as follows , August the 16th 1727 . I promise to pay to Samuel Edwards , Esq ; or Order , the Sum of one thousand two hundred and sixty Pounds , for Value receiv 'd . 1260 l. Thomas Kinnersley . And indros 'd , 1260 l. pray pay to the Order of - For the Value receiv 'd . Samuel Edwards . The Indorsment being examin 'd , it appear 'd to the Court and Jury , That the Bottom of several Letters were visible , and the paper cut and indented , as if to take out the Ends of all the Letters , though this was not done effectually ; and the Words to make as if indors 'd by Mr. Edwards , were of a different Ink from F , and the Note Samuel Edwards . Mr. William Wright depos 'd , That he was before Sir Richard Hopkins , when Mr. Kinnersley was brought before him , and he then confess 'd , That he wrote the Note all with his own hand , but did not write the Indorsment : Mr. Samuel Edwards being likewise there ask 'd , What Business he had to draw up a Note payable to him , when they never had any Dealings together , not had he so much as seen him before that Time ? To which Mr. Kinnersley answer 'd , he was indebted to Mr. Hales for more than the Sum mentioned in that Note , and Mr. Hales asking him for a Note , he desir 'd to know who he should make it payable too , and Mr. Hales directed him to draw it payable to Mr. Edwards ; and going further , as to the Note being indors 'd , pretendedly by Mr. Edwards , which he know of , and acknowledg 'd to Mr. Bird , before he had seen the Note ; he was stopp 'd by one Mr. Mitford . Sir Richard Hopkins depos 'd , That he committed Mr. Kinnersley upon the Affidavit of Mr. Bird , who swore , That Mr. Kinnersley acknowledg 'd the Note to be indors 'd by Samuel Edwards , before he shew 'd it him ; that he examin 'd Mr. Edwards , and he said , He never had any Dealings with Mr. Kinnersley ; and that Mr. Kinnersley than said , He drew up the Note so , at the Request of Mr. Hales ; and as he thought Mr. Kinnersley seem 'd before him as if he was minded to made an ingenious Confession , but was hinder 'd by the Interposition of a Gentleman belonging to the Law , whose Name he understood was Mitford . Richard Davis the Constable depos 'd , That a Warrant was brought to him , to execute on Mr. Kinnersley , and told his Inventions to take him , ( too many of them to repeat ) but as Mr. Kinnersley 's Council made use of the most material Part of this Evidence , to Mr. Kinnersley 's Advantage , it would seem partial to escape it . He told of his running and sending after him to little Effect , but at length got Admittance into his House and Person , though he had been before deny 'd . Mr. Kinnersley asking his Business , he said , A young Couple wanted to be marry 'd with a License , and he heard he had Licenses by him ; that they waited at the Magpye Tavern near Aldgate , and desir 'd he would perform the Ceremony . That Mr. Kinnersley ask 'd him the Man 's Name , which he said , was Bird of Fleet-street ; and farther asking if she the young Gentlewoman was of Age , he said he could not tell ; and asking if she had the Consent of her Father , he said no , to which Mr. Kinnersley answered , He would not marry them for a hundred Pounds , the Penalty for doing such an Action was 50 l. by Law . That he then ask 'd Mr. Kinnersley to drink a Glass of Wine with him , at the Magpye at Aldgate , and satisfy the young Gentlewoman , and her Brother , who was with her , that he did not care to undertake it ; but Mr. Kinnersley would not go with him . This he said , was to decoy him into the Freedom , for his Warrant did not extend to the Suburbs , where Mr. Kinnersley lived ; but this Sham not taking , he waited , and had his Ends soon after . The Council for Mr. Kinnersley observ 'd on this Conduct of his , That he acted like a Man of Conscience , in not performing an Act so unlawful , tho ' so frequently practis 'd . The Council for the King then said , they would endeavour to prove , That Mr. Hales , and Mr. Kinnersley , had for the last seven Months , before this Prosecution , frequently had private Meetings together , in such Manner , as it might be reasonably be believed they mutually agreed together to form these Designs , and doubtless Mr. Kinnersley was Guilty of this Forgery . Thomas Babb ( who keeps Peel 's Coffee-House in Fleet-street ) depos 'd , That for the greatest Part of last Summer , Mr. Kinnersley , and Mr. Hales , came to his House two or 3 Times a Week , that the one would stay in the publick Coffee-Room , till the other came , and then they would retire , one after the other , into a private Room ; that 4 or 5 Days before Mr. Hales was taken up , he was at his House , and seeing Mr. Kinnersley go by the Window , he got up and followed him . Mr. Brooks ( who keeps Brook 's Coffee-House in Downing-Street Westminster ) depos 'd , That Mr. Hales , and Mr. Kinnersley , frequently met at his House ; that Mr. Kinnersley would come first , and send a Porter , or his Servant to Mr. Hales , who would come , and then they went up Stairs , and that they have refus 'd a Candle , when he sent it up by the Boy , in the Dusk of the Evening . Mr. Janeway ( who keeps Janeway 's Coffee-House near the Royal-Exchange ) likewise depos 'd , That they came sometimes to his House , and went up Stairs , but being always in a Hurry of Business , he could not remember Particulars . Two Witnesses were call 'd , to prove , That Mr. Kinnersley was indebted to Mr. Hales a considerable Sum of Money , and Robert Burkett being one , said , He did not know of any Account between Mr. Hales and Mr. Kinnersley , but he had heard Mr. Hales say , Mr. Kinnersley ow 'd him Money ; the Weakness of this Evidence , and the other not appearing , made Mr. Kinnersley 's Council confess , That one Witness was quite lost , and the other had better never been found . However , some Witnesses appear 'd , who prov 'd ; That Hales and Kinnersley had Dealings together , and transacted Affairs for each other ; but this did not clearly prove , That Mr. Kinnersley was really indebted to Mr. Hales . Others were call 'd in Behalf of Mr. Kinnersley , who would have taken off the Strength of the Evidence of Sir Richard Hopkins , and others , in mentioning the Interposition of Mr. Mitford when Mr. Kinnersley seem 'd inclin 'd to make Confession , and Mr. Kinnersley call 'd the Living and True God to witness for his Innocence ; yet this , without positive Evidence , was of little Effect , though he had the Indulgence to be heard . The jury found them both Guilty . William Hales was again indicted , for procuring 750 l. by false Tokens , of Thomas Bird , and some of the same Witnesses being examin 'd , the Fact appear 'd plain against him , and the Jury found him Guilty . William Hales and Thomas Kinnersley were once more together indicted , for counterfeiting and forging a false Note , or Writing purporting , That a Note of 1650 l. was drawn by Samuel Edwards , and sign 'd by him , made payable to Thomas Kinnersley , dated March the 30th 1728 , and indors 'd Thomas Kinnersley . The Council for the King , made the same Observations as before , on the other counterfeit Note , that they were wrote on the Covers , frank 'd by Mr. Edwards , and by crouding one Letter , and obliterating another , it had been so order 'd , as to pass for a true Note ; and it being in the Hands of Mr. Hales , on the 22d of May last , he carry 'd it to one Mr. Thrup , and upon the Credit of this false counterfeit Note , Mr. Thrup lent him in Notes to the Value of 400 l. Mr. Maddox , Mrs. Clark , Mr. Booth , and Mr. Spicer , depos 'd as before , to prove the Methods made use of by Mr. Hales , to procure frank Covers of Mr. Edwards , & c. And then , Mr. Thrup depos 'd , That on the 22d of September last , Mr. Hales brought this Note to him ( holding it in his Hands ) and desir 'd him to lend 400 l. in Notes on it , which he did at that Time , reposing so much Confidence in Mr. Hales as to think he could not be Guilty of so vile an Action ; that the Money was not yet paid , nor had the Note been alter 'd . Mr. Thomas Williams depos 'd , That he being Churchwarden to Mr. Kinnersley , had seen him write , and looking on the Note , said , he did believe it to be Mr. Kinnersley own Hand Writing , and produc 'd the Parish-Book , to compare it with what Mr. Kinnersley had there written , and being compar 'd by the Court , the Jury believ 'd to be the very same Hand Writing . Mr. Lenton depos 'd , That he had likewise seen him write , and he did believe this Note to be his Writing . Then by Order of Court the Note was read , viz . March the 30th 1728 . I promise to pay to Mr. Thomas Kinnersley , or Order , six Months after Date , the Sum of one thousand six hundred and fifty Pounds , for Value receiv 'd . Per me Samuel Edwards . It was observ 'd by the Council for the King , That the Body of this Note , was all wrote in Secretary Hand , except the Name Samuel Edwards ; and the visible remains of the Word Free , which was round Hand , and this alone , would be a sufficient Evidence of the Forgery , but it was further prov 'd , by substantial Circumstances , and the Jury found them both Guilty . William Hales was then indicted singly , for forging and counterfeiting a Note of 4700 l. payable to Samuel Lee , or Order sing 'd Samuel Edwards , and fraudulently publishing the same , for a true Note , knowing it to be false and counterfeit . This Note , with the Name of Samuel Edwards , appear 'd to be likewise counterfeited , on the same Foundation with the others , and the same Alterations ; which was likewise confirm 'd by clear and positive Evidence , with several aggravating Circumstances ; in Particular this . Mr. Hales being under an Arrest this Time twelve Months , sent Mr. Kinnerslay to Sir Bibey Lake , and desir 'd he would be his Bail , which friendly Office Sir Bibey Lake perform 'd , and last July , Mr. Hales sent to Sir Bibey Lake again , and desir 'd he would be Bail for him again , to a Writ of Error , which made Sir Bibey Lake hesitate , and say , if he was Bail to a Writ of Error , he should be oblig 'd to pay the Money ; however , at Mr. Hales 's Desire , he went to Peel 's Coffee-House , in Fleetstreet , and there met him and Mr. Kinnersley , and Sir Bibey Lake insisting on Security , Mr. Hales gave him this Note of 4700 l. for his Security , and then Sir Bibey Lake went with him , and gave Bail before the Right Honourable Sir Robert Raymond . This Note was read by Order of Court , viz . March the 30th 1727 . I promise to pay to Mr. Samuel Lee , or Order , the Sum of four thousand and six hundred Pounds , six Months after Date , for Value receiv 'd . Per me Samuel Edwards : And at the Back indors 'd : Samuel Lee : Witnesses being call 'd , who knew this Samuel Lee , it appear 'd , That he was a poor indigent Fellow , and had never any Dealings with Mr. Edwards , not could his Dealings with Mr. Hales be extraordinary , though his Wife was Nurse to one of Mr. Hales 's Children ; the Jury likewise found him Guilty of this Indictment : Next Sessions he will be indicted again for a Crime of the like Nature .
