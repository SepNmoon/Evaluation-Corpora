The Indictment further set forth , That on the 22d of the said Month of February , 90 l. was paid by the Bank in part of the said Note ; and thereupon an Indorsement was made thereon , purporting , that Ninety Pounds were paid 22d Feb.1714 . The Indictment further set forth , That the said John Bigg feloniously ERASED the said Indorsement , contrary to the Form of the Stature made in this behalf Another Indictment was preferr 'd against the said John Bigg . and the same was for ALTERING the Indorsement on the Bank-Bill abovemention 'd . To these Indictments the Prisoner pleaded Not Guilty : And after a long and full Evidence on the Part of the Prosecutors , the Jury found specially these Facts , viz . That Joshua Odams made such Bank-Note for Payment of such Sum of 100 l. as abovemention 'd . That on the 22d of February 1714 . 90 l. was paid in part of the said Note ; and that upon such Payment , cross the writing thereof , were written these words and Figures , viz . 22 Feb.1714 . Paid Ninety Pounds . Which Words and Figures the Prisoner did totally Expunge and take out . Upon the Whole , the Jury doubted whether in Point of Law the Prisoner , by expunging the Words and Figures written upon the Face of the said Note , was guilty of Felony , or , in other Words , was guilty of Altering or Erasing an Indorsement of a Bank-Note , within the Meaning of the Statute . The Judges , upon this Occasion , being assembled at Serjeants-Inn-Hall in Fleetstreet , were attended by Council on both Sides ; where the Point of Law was solemnly argued : And after consideration thereof , the judges were of Opinion , that the Prisoner was guilty of Felony within the Meaning of the statute ; and at this sessions Judgement of Death was pronounced against him accordingly .
