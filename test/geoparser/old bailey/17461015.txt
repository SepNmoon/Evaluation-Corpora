As I was going into the Rope-Walk , I saw a Stranger bring the Gun in ; Mr. Wallis takes the Gun to look at it ; it was a Gun that unskrew 'd . The Man pulled the Rammer out of his Pocket , for there was no Place in the Gun to put the Rammer in ; so he folds it together again , and puts it into his Pocket .

Q . How long was it after she left your Service that Mr. Goodwin told you that she had stole any thing from him ? Bradshaw . I believe it was two Years afterwards . When Mr. Godwin came to me , I told him I had lost some remarkable Silk , which my W had in her Gown . Mr. Godwin told me , upon searching at Chelsea , where she had a Bastard Child at Nurse , that her Child had the Skirt of a Coat of a remarkable fine Silk ; upon which I desir 'd him to bring it to my House at London ; by comparing it , we found it to be the very same Silk which had lain by as useless , 'till we should make it up for Child of our own .

The Man being acquainted with the other Waterman , ask 'd him where he was bound for ? he answer 'd , Blackfryers ; so I said to my Waterman , You land where the other lands . When she got out of the Boat , I dogg 'd her up Blackfryers , and from thence to the Saracen's-Head on Snow-hill . I sent to my Master , and told him I had set Mrs. Jones ; there I waited some Time , and they went from thence into Newgate-Street , and from thence to the Harrow in Greyfryers ; she saw me , and went to run down that Place ; I said , Mrs. Susan , you shall go no further , you shall not slip my Hands . Q . ( to Bradshaw ) Have you any Reason to suspect that this Silk was stole from you ? Bradshaw . This Silk was in a Gown for my Wife , 't is very remarkable ; I bought it in France .

Katherine Jolly was indicted for stealing two large Silver Spoons and a Tea Spoon , the Goods of Anne Eddison , of Chiswell-Street . Q . ( to Anne Eddison ) Did you lose any Thing ? Eddison . Yes . A large Spoon and a Tea Spoon , the 27th of September . Q . Where were these Things ? Eddison . In a little Buffet . Q . Where do you live ? Eddison . In Chiswell-Street . Q . When did you first miss them ? Eddison . The Maid miss 'd them presently after the Prisoner was gone out of the House . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Eddison . Yes , my Lord , she was with me 14 Years ago , she nurs 'd me ; so she came to see me . Q . What Time was it ? Eddison . About Two or Three o'Clock in the Afternoon . Q . How long did she stay ? Eddison . About an Hour and Half . Q . Did you make any Pursuit after her ? Eddison . She said she lived down at Tower-Hill ; I went down that Way , and going about the Street I enquired of Black-shoe Folks , and the like , and I heard of her ; at last I came up Wellclose-Square and I saw her standing in Rosemary-Lane the next Day ; I ask 'd her whether she was not at my House yesterday Afternoon , she said yes ; I desir 'd her to go home with me ; which she accordingly did ; then I ask 'd the Maid if that was not the Person , and the Maid said yes ; so I charg 'd her with the Robbery , and she told me she had not got them ; I pleaded with her hard to tell me where the Spoons were ; she would not tell me any Thing about them , so I charg 'd the Constable with her . After we got her before the Justice she confess 'd it , she said she was turn 'd out of her Lodgings , that she had not a Farthing in the World to help herself ; that she had sold the great Spoon , and the little one she threw into the Vault . Q . What was it worth ? Eddison . They were both valued at 5 s. She told me she had pawn 'd it in Ratcliffe Highway , so on the Friday I went to every Silversmith and Pawnbroker I could find , and I happen 'd to go to this Gentlewoman 's House , Mrs. Wiles ; I ask 'd if there was not a Spoon there that Katherine Jolly had brought for a Crown , and she told me there was such a one brought ; I ask 'd her to tell me the Marks , she believ 'd it was the same Spoon that Katherine Jolly had shewn her : She would have sold it or pawn 'd it , but the Pawnbroker would not receive it . Q . ( to Mary Snow ) What are you ? Snow . I am a Servant Maid . Q . Did the Prisoner come to your Mistress 's House at any Time ? Snow . Yes my Lord ; the 25th of September . Q . How long did she stay ? Snow . An Hour and Half . Q . Did you remember when your Mistress brought her the next Day ? Snow . Yes my Lord . Q . Do you remember what she said ? Snow . I heard her confess it before the Justice ; she said she had pawn 'd one for a Crown , to pay her Lodging , and the other she hurl 'd away . Q . ( to Anne Wiles ) Did the Prisoner bring any Spoon to pawn ? Wiles . Yes , she did ; she desir 'd me to buy it , or she would pawn it , she said she brought it for a Friend , I said I would not trouble myself about it ; but as near as I can guess it was much the same as Mrs. Eddison shew 'd me . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 349. Mary Adams was indicted for stealing a Silver Spoon , Value 7 s. the Goods of John Manning , of Charing-Cross . Q . ( to John Manning ) What have you to aledge against the Prisoner ? Manning . She came into the Kitchen and took the Spoon . Q . Was you in the Kitchen yourself ? Manning . No , my Lord . Q . How do you know she took the Spoon ? Did you see her come out of the Kitchen ? Manning . When Dinner is over the Pewter is wash 'd up and brought into the Bar , and a Spoon being lost , all the Servants were examin 'd about it ; but as it could not be found I was thinking of advertising of it ; in the mean Time , one Mr. Clew , Constable of Westminster , came to me and ask 'd me if I had lost any Thing ; I told him I had just miss 'd a Silver Spoon , and he said he had got one . She went to pawn it to him , and he had the Spoon in his Custody ; I told him if it was mine I would shew him the Fellow to it , which I did ; when I went down to the Round-House with the Constable , she begg 'd I would be favourable to her , and she would never do any such Thing again . Q . Are you sure this is the Woman that came to your House ? Manning . I am sure of the Woman . When I went down to the Round-House she begg 'd I would be favourable to her ; I told her it was out of my Power , it must be as the Law directs ; with that I went to Justice Manly . She said it was given her among some broken Victuals , some stew 'd Beef , which we had none of for two Days before . First she said it was given her with broken Victuals , and afterwards own 'd that she took it . - Clew . I am the Constable of St. Margaret 's , Westminster . Q . What have you to say against the Prisoner ? Clew . Mr. Pearson sent for me , when I came , there was this Woman , the Prisoner at the Bar , with this Spoon . Q . What did he charge her with ? Clew . He stopp 'd this Spoon , as stolen . Q . Was you with her before the Justice . Clew . Yes , my Lord . Q . What did she say at Justice Manly 's ? Clew . She deny 'd the taking of it . - Pearson . On Saturday the 4th of October came in a short Woman , ( not the Prisoner at the Bar ) with this Spoon ; she desir 'd to know if it was Silver , and what she might have for it , and said she found it upon a Dunghill in Tyburn-Road . Whilst I was speaking with the Woman the Prisoner at the Bar immediately said , 't is my Spoon ; and that it was given her : I said , given you , by whom ? she said , at the House where I had some broken Victuals : I ask 'd her what House , and bid her tell me particularly and I would send my Servant ; she said she could not tell ; I then said I would charge a Constable with her ; she said it was her Property , and she gave it the other Woman to pawn ; upon that I sent for the Constable , and went before Justice Manly ; there she said it was given her with broken Victuals ; he ask 'd her how much , she said about as much as you could hold in your Hand ; he said it was strange such a Spoon should be buried in it . She said it was stew 'd Beef . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 350.

George Taylor and Mary Robinson , Widow , otherwise the Wife of the said George Taylor , were indicted for conspiring together , that the said George Taylor should personate Mr. Richard Holland , in order to her being married to the said Richard Holland , that she might entitle herself to his Estate , & c. and accordingly they were married the 18th of July , at the Parish Church of St. Andrew , Holbourn . Council for the Prosecution . This Indictment further sets forth , that Mary Robinson , upon the 18th Day of July , at the Parish of St. Andrew , Holbourn , did unlawfully contract Marriage with the the said George Taylor , in the Name of the said Richard Holland , & c. Council . I am likewise Council in this Cause for the Prosecution ; though this Indictment is laid several Ways , as is usual in such Cases , in order to prevent notorious Offenders escaping Justice , yet the Sum of the Indictment is only the fraudulent and wicked Contrivance of a Marriage between the two Defendants , in which the Defendant Taylor , was to personate , and did personate , Mr. Richard Holland . This is laid to be with a Design to distress and injure Mr. Holland , to entitle Mary Robinson , after his Death , to his Estate and Effects , as supposing this had been a real and true Marriage between Mr. Holland and her ; but in this Case the Intent of the Person can be made no otherwise than by the Nature and Circumstances of the Fact ; therefore , Gentlemen , I would beg Leave to state the Nature of the Thing ; this Person , Mary Robinson , liv 'd with Mr. Holland . The first Step we could trace out , was the Meeting of the two Defendants at the Sun-Tavern in St. Paul 's Church-Yard in July last . You ca n't expect we should call Witnesses to this Meeting , the Nature of the Thing will not admit of it ; the Intent of that Meeting will appear best by those Actions that follow it ; therefore , Gentlemen , I shall go to the next Step , taken the 18th of July : As this Defendant , George Taylor , was to personate Mr. Holland , who is a Gentleman of Fortune , it was necessary he should be provided with proper and decent Cloaths to personate a Gentleman ; for that Reason the Defendant , Mrs. Robinson , on the 17th of July , sent a Box from her Master 's House at Hornsey , in which there were a Coat of Mr. Holland 's , a ruffled Shirt , Neckcloth and Wig , these were directed to be left at Mr. Casker 's , who keeps an Inn in Little Britain , the 18th of July . The Defendant came to Town from Hornsey herself , goes to Mrs. Casker , finding it there she gave Directions to deliver this Box to the Person she should send for it ; when she had done this , she went directly to Mr. Holland 's House in Newgate-Street , there she pull 'd off a sort of Riding Habit , and dress 'd herself in white Sattin , which is in general looked upon to be the proper Habit for a Bride . As soon as she was dress 'd , she went to the Sun Tavern in St. Paul 's Church Yard , where they had their former Meeting ; it was now about Eight o'Clock in the Morning . There she dispatched another Messenger for George Taylor , at the East-India House , where he was sure to be in the Way : He came directly to Mrs. Robinson , at the Sun Tavern in St. Paul 's Church Yard . As soon as he came , she sent him to Doctors-Commons to procure a Licence for Marriage , in the Name of Richard Holland of Hornsey , Batchelor , and Mary Robinson , of the same Place , Widow . The Defendant , Taylor , goes to Doctors-Commons , and enquires for Mr. Rushworth , Proctor ; this Mr. Rushworth ask 'd him whether he was the Person to be marry 'd ; he answer 'd he was not : Perhaps you will wonder , he that was to personate Mr. Holland , should say he was not Mr. Holland ; the Reason of that was , that he had not as yet got on the Cloaths of Mr. Holland that were design 'd for him . Upon this Mr. Rushworth told him that he must have one of the Parties themselves come to him , and that Party must enter into a Bond , or make an Affidavit , or he could not grant a Licence . He returned to the Sun Tavern , where the Defendant Robinson was waiting for him , and told her what Mr. Rushworth said ; she goes immediately to Mr. Rushworth , and enters into Bond according to the Practice of that Court and Place , and the Place that was fix 'd upon for this Marriage , was at St. Andrew 's Holbourn ; it was not at the Fleet , or any such scandalous Place , therefore the Place fix 'd upon was St. Andrew 's . When Matters were so far prepar 'd , the next Step was , she dress 'd up the Defendant , Taylor , in order to personate Mr. Holland ; therefore , Gentlemen , he is sent to Mr. Casker for this Box ; the Box is delivered to him according to the Direction of the Defendant Robinson ; he carries it to Mr. Stangate 's in Holbourn , opens the Box , takes out the Coat , Neckloth , and Wig , and puts his own Cloaths in the Box : He then goes immediately to the King 's Head Tavern , Holbourn , where the Defendant , Robinson , was waiting for him , to go to be married . When he came there , it was necessary the Wig should be comb 'd out ; the Wig was comb 'd out ; from thence they went immediately to the Church , where the Defendant , Taylor , answer 'd to the Name of Richard Holland , and was married in that Name : So they return 'd to the King 's Head Tavern to take a short Dinner . It was then thought the Business was done . They had then done with the Cloaths of Mr. Holland , therefore the next Thing was to send them out of the Way ; so the Defendant , Taylor , goes back to Mr. Stangate 's , changes his Cloaths , puts Mr. Holland 's Cloaths into the Box , and takes a Person to carry the Box to Mr. Caskers . About an Hour after , the Defendant , Robinson , goes to enquire after this Box ; she gets somebody to carry it to Mr. Holland 's , and at Mr. Holland 's there was a Key of the Box left with the Defendant , Taylor , but it happen 'd that the Wig in this Box was missing , and it happen 'd likewise there were some Papers in the Coat Pocket , which he put up in a particular Manner , which when he came to see again , he found they were put out of Order : These two Things together , with something Mr. Holland was told , gave him some Suspicion , that he set about searching into this Affair ; upon that he took up both the Defendants , and carried them before Sir Thomas De Veil . The Defendant , Taylor , made a Confession ; we have Evidence of both their Confessions , but we believe we shall hardly have Occasion to make Use of either of them , but there is one Circumstance that may be mentioned , which happen 'd upon this Information . The Defendant , Taylor , was ask 'd , whether the Marriage was consummated ; upon that the Defendant , Robinson , said , you do n't understand the Meaning of that Word ; upon that he spoke plainly , that he had not lain with her . I mention this to shew that there was no real Marriage intended by these two Persons , but a fraudulent Marriage to another Person . 'T is not to be suppos 'd , that Persons that had so much Art and Wickedness to conduct a Scheme of this Kind , should have so much Honesty to declare their wicked Intentions , therefore the Fact must be gather 'd from Circumstances . Let us consider what would be the natural Consequence of this Marriage , suppose it could have been brought to take Effect , between Mr. Holland , and the Defendant , Robinson ; if it took Effect in his Life-time , it would have been the greatest Injury imaginable , not only in Point of Fortune , in marrying 2 Gentleman of Fortune to a Servant , a Person worth nothing , and probably less than nothing , and binding him to a Woman ; whereas the very Manner of his being bound to her , he must derest and abhor . If it was to take an Effect after his Death , then it would be a great Loss to the Heirs of Mr. Holland , who would lose so much of their own just Rights . 'T is not only a Misdemeanour , but of such a heinous Nature , that there is no Punishment that the Law can inflict for a Misdemeanour , is severe enough . Please your Lordship , I am likewise Council for the Prosecution . - Gentlemen , this is an Offence of the most uncommon Kind , as well as of a most wicked and dangerous Tendency . 'T is a Robbery not only against a single Person , but his Heirs and Executors ; it would leave an Imputation of Charge upon him after his Death : All this was to be effected after his Death , the Consequence of this would have been , to set up Claims for the Distribution of his Estate against his Heirs and nearest of Kin : Nay , it might have been attended with another Consequence ; he might have married a Lady , and have had Children , that this fictitious Marriage might have been set up against his real one , and might prove his lawful Children to be illegitimate , and his Estate go amongst Counterfeits and Impostors . The Common Law of England , as 't is a Law of Mercy , anticipates the Devices of wicked People ; therefore , Gentlemen , if we prove this Fact of Confederacy , if that Man did personate Mr. Holland in that Marriage , you will inflict such a Punishment as the Crime deserves , & c. Court . I am not for going a round-about Way when a shorter is sufficient ; you might go through all the other Evidence for the Entertainment of the Audience , but if you prove the Fact 't is sufficient . James Wright . By Vertue of a Licence from the Commons , the 18th of July , immediately after Morning Prayers , I married a Couple by the Names of Mary Robinson , of the Parish of Hornsey , Widow , and Richard Holland , Batchelor , of the same Place . [ The Licence produced in Court . ] Q . ( By the Council for the Defendants ) By what Names did they go ? Wright . By the Names of Robinson , Widow , and Richard Holland , Batchelor , as mention 'd in the Licence . Q . Are you sure he ( Taylor ) was one of them ? Wright . Yes , my Lord . Q . Was it Registered ? Wright . Yes , Sir : As to the Woman I ca n't pretend to say ; she had a large Bonnet covered all over her Eyes . Council for the Defendants . Mr. Wright , since you speak to the Identity of the Man , do you know that you ever saw him before ? I suppose you marry a great many Persons . Do n't you remember how you came to be so particular as to take upon you to say that these are the Cloaths that the Man wore at that Time ? Wright . The Man was in so great Confusion that the Sweat run down his Face . He seem 'd in the greatest Agony and Confusion whatever . Q . Sir , had you a Suspicion that the Man was doing any Thing wrong ? Wright . No , Sir ; but I saw the Man in such a Confusion , that I took particular Notice of him . The Man had a whitish Coat , and the Wig as Mr. Holland has now . Council . So the only Reason you judge them to be the same Cloaths , is because he had a white Coat and Wig ? Wright . I saw them upon Mr. Holland 's Back four or five Days after . Mr. Holland call 'd to ask me if I could take it upon me to say that he was the Man that I married ? Council . Sir , was you before Sir Thomas De Veil ? Did you not declare before the Justice that you did not remember the Man nor Woman ? Did you at that Time say that you knew the Man at all ? Wright . I gave a Description of the Man as well as I could ? Stephen Hall . I am Deputy Clerk of St. Andrew 's Holbourn . The Man is the same . Q . Is the Woman the same ? Hall . I ca n't positively swear to her ; I verily believe it to be the Woman , but she had a large Bonnet on ; I think that is the Woman that I gave away the 15th of July ; but I have brought the Register-Book . Q . Did you see any Thing of a Licence produced ? Hall . The Man brought a Licence , the Minister has it , which is now in Court . Q . Was you present all the Time of the Ceremony ? Were they actually married together , those two Persons ? Hall . That Man ( Taylor ) was , and I verily believe it to be the Woman . They were married by the Names of Mary Robinson and George Taylor , which I thought something odd , the Woman 's Name to be before the Man : The Entry is , July 18 , 1746. Mary Robinson , Widow , and Richard Holland , Batchelor , of Hornsey . Q . Who made that Entry ? Hall . Sir , I make these Entries myself .

( Price Six-Pence ) THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE King 's Commission of the Peace , Oyer and Terminer , and Gaol Delivery held for the City of London , & c. Q . As to this Woman at the Bar , did you not say something more positive of her before Sir Thomas De Veil ? Hall . No , I said I believ 'd her verily to be the Person . Q . How was she dress 'd ? Hall . In a white Sattin Gown , with a large Bonnet over her Face . Q . ( to John Lamb ) What do you know of this Matter ? Lamb . On the 18th of July , between the Hours of Eleven and Twelve , I went into the Church , and went down just as they were going to the Altar ; and I staid all the Time there while they were married . And as to the Prisoner at the Bar , I can safely take an Affidavit to the Man ; as to the Woman , I belive her to be the Woman ; but she had an extraordinary large black Bonnet on , that I could not see Part of her Face : As to the Man , he had such a large white Coat , that you might almost put a little Boy in it ; you might button it Half a Yard over . Q . By what Name did he go ? Hall . He went then by the Name of Richard Holland , of Hornsey . Q . Did he say , at the Performance of the Ceremony , I Richard Holland , & c. Hall . Sir , I ca n't say I was so near as to hear it . Q . ( to Mary Price ) Do you belong to St. Andrew 's Church in Holbourn ? Price . Yes , Sir . Q . Was you at the Church upon the 18th of July , when there was a Marriage there ? Price . Yes , Sir . Court . Look at the two People at the Bar , and tell us whether those two were the People that were married . Price . Mr. Taylor was the Man , and I believe Mrs. Robinson was the Woman : The Woman was dress 'd in a white Sattin Gown , and she had a black Bonnet over her Face . Q . What Name was he married by ? Price . He was married by the Name of Richard Holland . Q . ( to Philip Moor ) What are you ? Moor . I am Clerk to Mr. Rushworth , of Doctors-Commons . On the 18th of July , between the Hours of Nine and Twelve ; George Taylor , the Prisoner at the Bar , came to Mr. Rushworth 's Office , and ask 'd if he might have a Licence there ; I ask 'd him if it was for himself ; he said , No ; I said , One of the Parties must come ; upon that he return 'd . Accordingly Mrs. Robinson came ; she was shewn into the Office , and George Taylor went away , and left her there . Mr. Rushworth came down Stairs , and took her up into his Office . Q . What did you see this Woman do ? Moor . Sir , I saw her do no particular Act , but only came for a Licence . Q . What did she say ? Moor . I did not hear her say any thing particular . Q . Do you believe that to be the Licence ? Moor . I believe so ; but I did not see the Inside of it . Q . Did she subscribe an Affidavit ? Moor . Not in my Presence . Council . How came you to be so positive to this Gentlewoman ; did you ever see her before ? Moor . No , Sir . Council . I suppose you do n't remember all the Persons that come to your House for Licences . If her Face was cover 'd with this Bonnet , my Lad , how came you to be so particular as to her Face . Moor . It 's a Thing that seldom happens , for a Woman to a apply for a Licence . Council . So then , when a Woman applies for a Licence , you more particularly remark her . Had you met this Woman afterwards in the Street , should you have known her ? Moor . Yes ; because , I believe I have seen her before , considerable Time before she liv 'd in that Neighbourhood . Council . Just now , if I understood you , you said you had not seen her before : If you had been accidentally in her Company , should you have remark 'd that she was the same Woman , if you had had no particular Cause to have taken Notice of her ? Moor . I do n't know whether I should or no . Council . My Lad , I would ask you , How long was it before any body came to ask you any thing with relation to that Woman ? Moor . About nine or ten Days . Council . Who was the Person that apply 'd to you ? Moor . One Mr. Gosling , a Proctor in the Commons . Council . Did you then presently recollect the Circumstances of that Woman . Moor . When they told me of the Licence , I recollected then . Council . When you was first apply 'd to , did you , or did you not recollect the Person of the Woman ? Moor . The Question that was put to me was , Whether I did not remember there was such a Licence ? but I could not , at that Instant , recollect that she was the Woman , 'till they told me Circumstances more particular . Q . Now , before you recollected that she was the Person of the Woman , did any body remind you of any particular Circumstance to put it into your Memory ? The first Time you saw her , did you recollect her ? Moor . Yes . Council . This Mrs. Robinson is a pretty tall Woman ; therefore , though she had a Bonnet upon her Head , you might see her Face much easier than another Person , as you are such a short Man . Moor . Yes . Council . Then you were very curious , my Lad , and peep 'd very earnestly at it ; then it pleas 'd you very much . Q . ( to Henry Simons ) What are you ? Simons . A Porter ; I ply at the Sun Tavern in St. Paul 's Church-Yard . Q . Do you remember this Woman , Mrs. Robinson , being at the Sun Tavern the 18th of July ? Simons . I have no Knowledge of the Woman at all . Q . Did any body send you to fetch Mr. Taylor ? Simons . There was a Woman sent me for the Man that is at the Bar , to the East-India Warehouse in Fenchurch-Street ; it was in July , but what Day of the Month I ca n't tell . Q . Did you bring that Man ? Simon . He did not come with me , but he came about a Quarter of an Hour afterwards , and ask 'd me where the Woman was . He was in a darkcolour 'd Coat . Q . ( to John Loe ) What are you ? Loe . I am a Drawer . Q . Do you remember Robinson , the Prisoner at the Bar ? Loe . Yes , Sir , she liv 'd in the Neighbourhood before ; I do n't know any thing but of her sending the Porter for John Taylor . Q . Did you know the Woman before ? Loe . Yes , Sir ; I knew Mrs. Robinson a long Time before she liv 'd in the Neighbourhood . Q . When Taylor came , do you remember Mrs. Robinson 's and his going out together ? Loe . No , Sir , I do n't remember that . Q . ( to Thomas Howard ) Did any body , upon the 17th of July , order you to carry a Box from Mr. Holland 's House in Hornsey , to Town ? Howard . Yes , Sir ; Mrs. Robinson , at the Bar , she order 'd me to bring the Box to Town , and to leave it at the Stable where her Master puts up his Horses . Q . What 's the Name of the People ? Howard . Casker . Q . ( to - Casker ) Do you remember a Box brought to your Inn the 18th of July last ? Do you know George Taylor ? Casker . That Man , the Prisoner , came for the Box : Mrs. Robinson came early in the Morning and told me the Man would call for it ; the Prisoner came in the Morning to take it away ; and in the Afternoon he brought it again . Mrs. Robinson came in the Afternoon to know if the Box was brought ; I said , Yes ; then she said , Send it to Mr. Holland 's in Newgate-Street . Q . Do you know what was in the Box ? Casker . No , Sir , I can not tell . Q . ( to Robert Montgomery ) Do you know the Prisoner ? Have you seen her write ? Montgomery . Yes , my Lord , several Times . Q . Is that her Writing ? Montgomery . Yes , my Lord , I believe it is her Writing . Q . ( to Miles Parker ) Do you know these two Persons at the Bar ? Parker . I know the Gentlewoman , not by Name , but by Sight , for many Years ago . Q . Do you remember her being at the King's-Head Tavern the 18th of July ? Parker . I remember she was there , ( but I ca n't remember the Time ) and I think that Man , the Prisoner , was with her about Ten o'Clock . Q . How were they dress 'd ? Parker . She was dress 'd in white Sattin and a Bonnet ; she staid there and drink 'd a Pint of Wine herself , before that Gentleman came . He went out , and came in again ; when he came in again he came in a light-colour 'd Coat and a light Wig , and he wanted the Wig comb 'd ; he said , You need not carry it to the Barber 's ; Ca n't you comb it yourself ; so I comb 'd it . Q . What did they do there ? Parker . They din 'd there . Q . What had they for Dinner ? Parker . To the best of my Remembrance , they had an Artichoke and a cold Lobster . Council . Please your Lordship , and Gentleman of the Jury , I am Council in this Cause , for Mrs. Robinson ; against whom there is an Indictment for Conspiracy , & c . And the Gentlemen are extremely sensible , I find , on the other Side , if they had laid this Fact without coupling it with a Conspiracy , that it would not have been at all criminal . Our Common Law do n't hinder any People from marrying together by any Name they please ; therefore , this Conspiracy only must appear to you to be some Injury to some Person or another , and particularly this Gentleman , who says he is so injur 'd . I shall heartily agree with the Doctrine that has been advanced by the Gentlemen on the other Side , with regard to this Conspiracy ; but that Intent ought to be made plain ; which must naturally arise from the Fact itself , and not by way of Supposition ; for 't is Conspiracy only , as I apprehend , will make it criminal . I should be sorry to advance Doctrines not establish 'd by the Law Common , or by Statutes . I never heard , that particular Persons may not marry by whatsoever Name they please . Supposing People were got in Debt , and it was improper to go by their own Names , and they thought proper to marry by a fictitious Name , and this Name happens to with the Name of some Man or Woman ; they may imagine they are injur 'd : By what Law is any Man injur 'd by it ? If they could make out that there has been a Combination on purpose to affect the Estate of a third Person , or on purpose to claim that Estate in their Lifetime ; then it would have amounted to a Combination together ; it would have amounted to a Conspiracy , to injure a third Person : But , is there any thing like it ? Was there any Discourse upon it ? What they might have in their Heads , God knows ! I never knew any human Judicature could reach the Thoughts or Intentions , 'till Facts were made plain and clear . As in the Case of the Lottery Ticket , that was argued in this Place some time ago : Any Person living might take it and cut it to Pieces , and make what Alterations he pleas 'd , provided he did it without any Intention to defraud any Person . My Lord , this is a Precedent of the most dangerous Consequence ; and 't is stretching the Law upon the suppos 'd Fancy of an Indictment-Drawer , beyond whatever was known : If this was to prevail , I could mention an hundred Illconveniencies Persons might be brought into . Suppose a Person comes into a Room , and there should happen to be a Parcel of Ladies , and he blows out the Candle ; Oh ! this is a Rogue , and he intends some Attack upon their Virtue : If a covetous Man ; Oh , this is a Rogue ; he could blow the Candle out with no other Intention but to pick these Ladies Pockets ; and all upon a Supposition ; whether the Man ever touch 'd one of the Women , or ever attempted to pick a Pocket . So the Drawer of the Indictment is to fancy that this is a criminal Thing , tho ' no Fact was ever done . I should agree with you , if she had come and said she was actually married , and had declared her Intention , or had she claim 'd any Benefit ; but to say , 'till that is done , what I had in my Head , you must take upon yourself that Judgment which the Almighty only can , who knows Thoughts ; though this might be a Frolick better let alone : But should not a Woman get her a Husband if she can , and the Man get him a Wife ; Marriage is honourable in all ; and I could wish People would marry one with another and live such Lives as they should do ; the contrary is Batchelor 's Doctrine . I never heard Marriage should be call 'd Conspiracy , because I have a Mind to marry a Woman by a Name not her own ; perhaps it might be some private End of their own , which the World might not know ; perhaps there was an Estate depending upon it . I 'll imagine there was as well as they : Suppose she should have married a Person by another Name ; it might be because she would not be despised by her Relations , or in Order to pass well in the World . We are bound never to believe Iniquity unless it appears . My Lord there is a great Stress laid upon this Habit , this Dress of the Lady 's ; she was dressed in Sattin , says the Gentleman , a pure white innocent Sattin ; a very proper Dress for a Bride . He would conclude from thence , that she was the Person actually married at this Time : There is no positive Evidence she was married , 't is only grounded on Supposition . She was dressed in a black Bonnet . That is not conclusive Evidence ; a Hundred Ladies may wear white Sattin and have black Bonnets , and the same Day one of these Ladies might be married ; and yet a young Gentleman , says he , looked at her very narrowly and could see her Face . It was a wonderful Thing ; I think it a great Difficulty to distinguish one Woman from another when muffled up ; therefore it was no Wonder if this young Spark might be deceiv 'd , as his Curiosity was only led by the Size of this Bonnet . Why , Gentlemen , is so great a Stress to be laid on this Habit because it was white Sattin ? That might be emblematical of Innocence ; there is something of a particular Softness in the Colour , more agreeable to the Touch than rougher wrought Silk , therefore very proper for a Bride ; and I believe 't is their common Dress : Therefore because it was white Sattin , and a Woman had it on , they conclude this must be the Woman . My Lord they have gone through a Train of Evidences ; but let us see whether this will amount to Evidence . They give you a Narrative of their meeting at the Stable , there was a Box brought , & c. Here 's a Gentleman that fills up Mr. Holland 's Coat compleatly , but this Man could not fill it up ; which Way was that personating him ? for my Part , I am at a Loss to know ; I should rather think that their Intention was entirely otherwise ; or he would have had a Coat that should have fitted him better . What say they then , that there came a Box to Casker 's , and then sent to Mr. Holland 's : Gentlemen , how can you tell but these Clothes might be lent to the Gentlewoman to get her a Husband . I am told she was not actually a Servant , but came there with the Esteem and Approbation of Miss Andrews , she having had the Tuition of her . If Mr. Holland had a Mind for a Person that was agreeable to him , the Clothes might be taken by his Approbation ; I have known frequent Instances of Clothes being given , and sometimes lent by Masters . Why therefore this such a mighty Matter , that a Suit of Clothes should go out of the House ? How does this manifest an Intention to do him any Wrong ? If I have another Man 's Suit of Clothes and am married in them , must it be inferr 'd from thence that I intended to get his Estate ? They might also have said I intended to rob him , or cut his Throat . I can not , my Lord , for my Heart , conceive why this Person is to claim this Gentleman in his Life-time ; it could not be prov 'd , she never did it , or said she was the Wife of Mr. Holland ; and why should they say it was to affect him after his Death ? This is saying a Thing that I might never have had in my Head ; this Intention ought to have been manifested by some overt open Acts done ; as if a Man shoots off a Gun into a Place where there are an hundred People walking ; there he is doing an unlawful Thing , where the People are in the utmost Danger ; but is marrying in itself , by another Name , an unlawful Thing ? Is marrying in another Man 's Clothes unlawful ; I never heard of it ; nor I hope there never will be any such Law . I shall say but one Word more in Favour of my Client , which I hope will be sufficient to conclude this Matter : Supposing , for Instance , that she had private Reasons of her own for obtaining a Husband in some Shape or another . I will suppose now , if we are to go upon Suppositions , that she had done something or another that was improper , that she wanted a Husband , and she had a Mind to conceal his Name ; suppose she had a Husband to screen her from Debt , and so married him by another Name ; every Creditor of her 's might say , that she conspired to marry that Man in order to cheat them of their Debts . Council . I am Council of the same Side , Please your Lordship , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , to favour me with a few Words : I beg Leave humbly , in the first Place , to say , if they were married , as the other Side insist upon , then an Indictment for Conspiracy must lie against Husband and Wife ; in the next Place I shall shew , that there is no sufficient Proof of the Fact : Then again I would observe , that an Indictment for Conspiracy against Husband and Wife can not stand ; and if your Lordship should be of Opinion with that Part of the Indictment ; yet , as 't is laid , I apprehend the Gentlemen have fail 'd in Point of Proof ; they have proved no Conspiracy at all ; as to injuring the Person of Mr. Holland , I apprehend nothing of that Kind has been proved ; and as to an Injury of his Estate , Goods or Chattels , I apprehend nothing has been prov 'd , nor against himself , his Administrators , Heirs , Executors , & c. A Conspiracy , in its Nature , must be to do an Injury to a Third , in regard to his Person or Estate . Gentlemen , as to the Fact , where a Person is to be convicted as a Criminal ; where a Person is subjected to a Fine or Imprisonment , there ought to be the clearest Proof in the World . As to the Marriage , I do n't apprehend any one Person has been capable to prove the Fact , as to the Identity of the Woman ; that is the Fact that you are to try : If there is no Evidence of it , in all Cases of criminal Prosecutions , we are to incline to the favourable Side , which is Mercy . As there has been no Injury done to the Person of Mr. Holland , so I apprehend any two Persons may marry , in any Name whatever , without a Crime ; or , if it is a Crime , not punishable by an Indictment . If there had been any Claims on Mr. Holland 's Goods or Effects , that might have been Evidence of Intention and Conspiracy ; but as nothing of that has been prov 'd , so it ca n't be proved any Injury to him : Persons may have particular Ends to themselves in marrying in what Name they think fit ; 't is not that which constitutes the Offence ; but it must be done with a Design to prejudice Mr. Holland ; and as he has shew 'd nothing of that Sort , no Injury can be done to him or his Successors ; therefore they have fail 'd in this Point . Mary Robinson . My Lord , I humbly beg this Favour , though they prove my Dress , that you would ask Mr. Holland whether it was not my every Day 's Dress ; and I do n't know , at this Time , whether I had it on or not : Mr. Holland invited me as a Companion to himself ; and I have it under his Hand that I was not his Servant . Mary Robinson and George Taylor Guilty of Conspiracy . [ Mr. Holland recommended Taylor to the Favour of the Court , as believing him to be drawn in by the Woman . ] The Judgment of the Court upon Mary Robinson was as follows , That you be imprison 'd for the Space of two Years in the Gaol of Newgate ; and after the Expiration of that Time to give Security of 500 l. and pay a Fine of five Marks . As to you , George Taylor , the Sentence that the Court thinks proper to pronounce upon you is , that you be imprison 'd for six Months in the Poultry-Compter ; that you give Security yourself in the Sum of 40 l. and two Securities in 40 l. each , and pay a Fine of five Marks . After Judgment was passed Mary Robinson produced a Paper to prove that she was not with Mr. Holland as a Servant ; but it was not read ; she also petition 'd the Court for Leave to be remov 'd from Newgate , either to the Poultry-Compter or the Fleet-Prison , alledging , that she had been ill , and Newgate was too close for her ; but it was denied . 355. Robert Fitzgerald was indicted for counterfeiting a Pall of Exchange for the Sum of 21 l. 15 s. drawn upon Mr. Albert Nesbit and Company , of Coleman-Street , payable to Capt . John Hancock , or uttering the same , knowing it to be forg 'd , with an Intent to defraud the above said Nesbit and Company . Council . This Indictment sets forth , that Robert Fitzgerald , wickedly , unlawfully and feloniously , did forge and counterfeit a Bill of Exchange for 21 l. 15 s. payable to Capt . John Hancock : This is laid to deceive Albert Nesbit and Company . Council . I am Council of the same Side in support of this Prosecution ; you will observe , Gentleman , It is a Prosecution founded on an Act of Parliament made in the second Year of his present Majesty 's Reign ; 't is laid upon this Act of Parliament , which has been found a most necessary Law , a Law calculated for the Benefit of Trade ; and 't is a little surprizing that our Ancestors , who were very wise , should not have thought of such a Law , which is calculated for the Conviction and Punishment of so great a Crime as Forgery . On the 6th of September last , about Seven o'Clock in the Evening , the Prisoner came to this Part of the Town , towards the Old Baily , and call 'd for a Porter ; a Porter answer 'd immediately . I am a Stranger here in Town , says he ; Which is the nearest Way to Coleman-Street ? I must get you to shew it me : But just as they were about Bow Church , says he , I want to go to Blossoms Inn ; is that far out of the Way ? No , says the Porter ; then shew me there . Then , said he to the Porter , I want you to carry a Bill to one Mr. Nesbit 's in Coleman-Street , and come back to me at the Inn ; if you should not find me there , then you will find me here at Nine o'Clock in the Morning . When the Porter gave the Bill to Mr. Nesbit , he told him it was a good Bill , and he should call To-morrow Morning . As he was coming back to find the Prisoner , he heard some body call Porter ; there the Prisoner lay conceal 'd in Lawrence-Lane , he did not care to be at the Inn ; for if the Bill had appear 'd to be bad , he thought a Constable might come . Well , says he , what have you done about the Bill ? why they say 't is a good Bill , so I left it : The Prisoner said , very well . Mr. Nesbit looking narrowly into it concluded it was a Forgery ; he said , this is not Mr. Barton 's Hand , nor is it after the Manner they draw their Bills ; for they are on Copper-Plate and in French . When another Porter came the next Day they got a Constable and laid hold of him , and ask 'd him where he had the Bill ; he said he had it from a Gentleman in Whitechapel , who was then waiting for him : Mr. Neshit 's Porter and the Constable went to the Place and met with him : They carry 'd him before the Lord Mayor where he gave but a very slender Account of ask 'd him where he had the Bill ; he of one Johnson , and that he gave him Money ; but could not tell any thing about Johnson where he liv 'd . Gentlemen , I am well brought very home ; we shall call our Witnesses , and we do n't doubt but you will act the P of honest Men . Council . I am Council on the same Side . You will observe this Indictment charges the Prisoner at the Bar with a Crime of a very heinous Nature , no less than Forgery , and of a Species of Forgery that is very pernicious . Gentlemen , there is one Difficulty which is a Misfortune to the Publick ; that it is extreamly difficult to convict Offenders by positive Proof ; Crimes of this Nature are generally transacted in the Dark : What we are to lay before you , and the only Evidence that can be brought , are the Circumstances and Manner of transacting this Bill of Exchange . Gentlemen , the Prisoner at the Bar is no Stranger ; he is a Person that has liv 'd in the Compring-House of a great Merchant in this City , Mr. Dillon ; but when he enter 'd upon this Scene of Action , and discover 'd himself in this Part of the Town , he told the Porter that he was an entire Stranger , desir 'd to know which was Coleman-Street ; and not satisfied with his telling him the Way , desir 'd he would go with him : When he came into Cheapside he ask 'd if it was much out of the Way to go to Blossom 's Inn ; there he pull 'd out the Bill and desir 'd him to go to Mr. Nesbit 's . The Porter shew 'd it to one of the Mr. Nesbit 's , who just cast his Eyes upon it and told him it was a good Bill . It seems the Prisoner at the Bar had directed him to come to him to the Blossom 's Inn ; the Porter returned thither and did not see him ; but a Person at some Distance call 'd out Porter , and he found the Prisoner at the Bar was behind ; upon that he ask 'd what he had done , what Mr. Nesbit said to the Bill ; he answer 'd , Mr. Nesbit said it was a good Bill . I would observe to you , as I go along , that this seems to be an extraordinary Method of negociating a Bill of Exchange ; it is uncommon for a Person to call a Porter in the Street , to send a mere Stranger with a Bill of Exchange to a Merchant . Would it not have been natural to have gone himself to Mr. Nesbit 's to have had this Bill of Exchange accepted , instead of loitering about Blossom 's Inn ? The next Day he thought proper to proceed in a different Manner ; then the Scene of Action was open 'd in Whitechapel ; there he calls a Porter and sends him for the Money , as supporting the Bill accepted : But I should have told you , that Night , or the next Morning , Mr. Nesbit having an Opportunity to examine the Bill , found it was not one of those he used to receive from Barton and Comp . it was different in the Hand writing ; and another Circumstance , that Mess . Barton have for many Years had their Bills printed upon Copper-Plate , and fill 'd up their Names and Sums in Writing ; Mr. Nesbit observing all this to be written , concluded it was a false Bill , and order 'd that the Person who should call for it the next Morning might be secured . A Porter coming from Whitechapel for the Hill , Mr. Nesbit 's Servant immediately sent for a Constable and secur 'd him : Enquiry was then made who he was and from whence he came ; he said he was directed to come by a Person who was waiting for him at the Fountain Alehouse ; they went thither in search of him , but he had left that House and was found loitering in the Street : Seeing the Porter he went up to him and ask 'd him what he had done with the Bill ; the Fellow call 'd him Rogue , and told him that he had like to have drawn him into a Scape , for it was a forged Bill . The Constable being near at hand seiz 'd him and carry 'd him before the Lord Mayor ; when before his Lordship he said he gave a valuable Consideration for it to one Johnson ; but I think at last he confess 'd that he knew nothing of Johnson ; whereupon he was committed to the Compter , from whence he attempted to escape in Women 's Clothes , but was prevented by the Vigilance of the Keeper . Here is another Circumstance : He wanted to su one of the Porters to swear falsly ; he desir 'd him to say , if he was ask 'd where he had the Bill of Exchange , that he had it in St. Paul 's Church-Yard ; which is a Circumstance directly contrary to Truth , and if Wells had swore that , he would have been guilty of Perjury . These are the Circumstances ; if we prove them to your Satisfaction , it will be impossible for you to think any otherwise than that this was a false Bill of Exchange . We shall call our Witnesses . Q . ( to Christopher Wells . ) Do you know that Person , the Prisoner ? Wells . I ca n't swear I do know him ; I have seen him twice . Council . Tell us upon what Occasion ; when did you see the Prisoner ? Wells . I never saw him before that Night . Q . What are you ? Wells . I am a Ticket Porter . Council . Give an Account when you first saw him . Wells . It was when he came to me and call 'd one Porter ; it was the Corner of the Old Baily . Q . What Month was it ? Wells . I ca n't tell Q . What did he say to you ? Wells . He said , Sir , he ask 'd me whether I knew Coleman-Street ; then he said , will you be so good as to shew me the Way ; step along Porter . Q . Which Way did you go ? Wells . Under Newgate and down Cheapside . Q . What did he say to you as you were going down Cheapside ? Wells . He ask 'd me if I knew Moorgate Coffee-House , and he ask 'd if I know Blossom 's Inn . Q . What did he say to you then ? Wells . He said he had Friend there . I must tell the Whole ; I went to Blossom 's Inn in Lawrence-Lane , then I went to ease myself . Council . What is that to the Purpose . Did he go with you to Blossom 's Inn . Wells . When we were together in the Gate he gave me a , and ask 'd me it I knew such a Gentleman ; but I have forgot it . Council . Who gave you the Note ? and what did he did you do with it ? Wells . He said , you may leave the Note if you will . Council . Do n't you remember the Gentleman 's Name . Wells . Sir , I do not . Q . Whereabouts in Coleman-Street did that Gentleman live ? Wells . Sir , to the best of my Knowledge 't is the second Gateway beyond the Church . Q . When you carry 'd the Note there who did you see ? Wells . I saw three Gentlemen . Q . Do you know any of them ? Look upon those Gentlemen . Wells . Sir , I ca n't say ; but I think that is one of them . [ But that Gentleman was a Stranger . ] When I went he bid me return to him at Blossom 's Inn ; and if he was not there then , I should find him there at Nine o'Clock the next Morning . Before I got to Blossom 's Inn the Gentleman was behind me , and called after me , Porter , Porter , what have you done with the Bill ? I told him it was a good one . Q . Did you see the Prisoner at any Time after this ? Wells . He sent for me to the Compter ; to the best of my Memory be order 'd me to say that the Bill was given me in Paul 's Church-Yard ; that I must not say I was at Blossom 's Inn with him . Council . I would ask you if any Money was offer 'd you ? Wells . He said if I came To-morrow Morning he would give me a Crown to put in my Pocket ; he thought that a Crown would be of Service to me . Council . for the Defendant , Wells , you could not recollect the People at Mr. Nesbit 's , how came you to remember him more than them ? Did you not say when you first went to the Compter , that it was another Man ? Wells . No , Sir ; I said I can not swear that he is the Person . Council . I ask you before the Court , whether he was the Man that gave you the Note , or the Man that gave you the Six-pence ? Wells . I will not swear to him ; for I was in the Dark with him in the Compter . Q . ( to Arnold Nesbit ) Do you remember at any Time , and when Bill was brought to you ? Nesbit . Sir , this Bill was brought me on Tuesday Night , the 16th of last Month . Q . Is Mr. Barton your Correspondent ? Nesbit . Yes , Sir ; the Porter came for Acceptance , and I told him I believ 'd it was a good Bell ; that he should call To-morrow , as is usual in those Cases . Q. Pray , Sir , What Port er brought you the Bill ? Nesbit . Sir , I ca n't swear to the Porter that came that Night ; but this Man came to me about a Week after , and said that he came from the Man in Prison , and he offer 'd him 6 d . Q . Had you any Conversation with any Porter about bringing this Bill to you ? You told this Porter that he brought the Bill . Did he tell you that he brought the Bill to you at first ? Nesbit . Yes , he said he did bring the Bill : I told him it was a good Bill , and if they came the next Morning they should have it accepted . When Bills are brought we never accept them the same Day , they always lie for us to examine by our Books . Q. Pray how came your Brother so well acquainted with Mr. Barton ? Nesbit . My Brother lived several Years with Mr. Barton , who never draws a Bill without Advice ; and it not being a Copper-Plate Bill , which is usual , increased our Suspicion ; so I spoke to all the People of the Compting-House , that whoever came for the Bill the next Morning should be stopp 'd ; accordingly a Porter came for it , who said he was sent from Whitechapel for that Bill which was left upon the Desk ; he told us that the Man he receiv 'd it from was in Whitechapel ; so we sent for a Constable , John Wild . Q . What Orders did you give the Constable ? Nesbit . I order 'd the Constable to go with the Porter , and sent my own Porter with them . Council . I would ask you whether you afterwards saw him ? Nesbit . Yes , Sir ; the Prisoner at the Bar sent for me to a Publick-House in Coleman-Street . Q . What pass 'd upon that Occasion ? Nesbit . He told me had liv 'd with Mr. Dillon ; that he had the Bill from another Person , and desir 'd the Favour I would not take any Notice of it . Q . At what Place was this ? Nesbit . At the Swan in Coleman-Street . Q . Who did he say that he had the Bill from ? Nesbit . I ca n't say . Q . Did he then say he liv 'd with Mr. Dillon ? Nesbit . That he then liv 'd with Mr. Dillon he said ; that he had the Bill from a Person , but he did not say from whom ; he was carried before my Lord Mayor . Q . What pass 'd before my Lord Mayor ; What Account did he give of himself ? Nesbit . I think he said he was at an Alehouse at Temple-Bar , with one Johnson , and that he had the Bill of him ; that he was a Seafaring Man , and that he had not seen him but twice before . Q . Did he afterwards alter his Account of it ? Netbit . No , Sir , he said he had paid Part of the Bill . Council for the Defendant . Mr. Nesbit , Did you ever see Mr. Barton write ? Nesbit . I ca n't say I ever saw him write . Council . He has a Son and a Partner , I suppose they sometimes sign ; have you ever wrote over since ? Nesbit . I wrote the Post after , but we have not receiv 'd an Answer ; I believe we could not in Point of Time . Q . ( to Mr. Albers Nesbit ) Did you see that Bill brought to your Compting-House ? Nesbit . I took it up after it was left , and said it was not Mr. Barton 's Hand . Q . Did you take Notice of the Person that brought that Bill ? Nesbit . No , Sir , I did not . Q . When you took up the Bill , did you say any Thing upon that Occasion ? Nesbit . I said it was a forged Bill , because I liv 'd so long with Mr. Barton , that I saw him write several Times , and I believ 'd it was not signed by William Barton , or Thomas Barton ; they generally draw their Bills in French , especially since the War , and they are generally on Copper Plate Paper . Q . When you was in Bourdeaux with them , did they generally draw upon Stamp Paper ? Did you ever receive any drawn in a different Manner ? Nesbit . I do n't remember . Q . Have you any Bills upon-other Paper at your House ? Nesbit . Not since I came to London . Q . How long have you been in London ? Nesbit . About a Year . Q . ( to James Whiteing ) Do you recollect whether at any Time you was sent to Coleman-Street with a Bill ? Whiteing . Yes , I know it as well as any can know it . Council . Now give an Account at what Time you saw him . Whiteing . Last Wednesday was three Weeks , he ( the Prisoner ) came to me to the Stand where I ply . The Prisoner came to me about Three o'Clock ; he said Porter , follow me ; he carried me into Somerset-Street , Whitechapel ; he said will you go on an Errand for me into Coleman-Street ; I said , yes ; so then , said he , do you know Mr. Nesbit 's in Coleman Street , I said no , but I can find him out if 't is any Body of Note ; he said you must go to Mr. Nesbit 's for a Bill that lies upon the Desk . Q . Did you go to Mr. Nesbit 's ? Whiteing . Yes , as soon as I came to Mr. Nesbit 's , I gave him the Note I had ; when I gave it to him , a short Man , Mr. Nesbit 's Clerk , was holding a Carpenter 's Board ; while he was putting it up , he said Friend sit down ; I was very uneasy at staying ; however , I sat down about a Quarter of an Hour , then in comes Mr. Arnold Nesbit ; he said , where 's this Man ? I expecting my Bill , Mr. Nesbit said to the Officer , Friend , there 's your Prisoner ; I said Prisoner , what do you mean ? I said Sir , I ca n't think what you mean ? he said I had forged a Bill ; I said you might as well say I built St. Paul 's ; you must go to Newgate ; I said I could not make a Letter ; I said , first let me go and find the Man , and when I come almost to the Place the Officer and the Porter shall leave me ; as I find 't is a Cheat , the Man will never come after me . Q . Where did the Prisoner appoint you to come to him ? Whiteing . To Somerset-Street at the Fountain . When we came to Aldgate , then the Constable stay 'd behind ; the Officer went down by the Butchers , and the Porter was near the Bars ; I ran hard with my Hands in my Pocket to the Fountain , and asked for a Man that I described as well as I could , but he was not there : Then I turned out of the House , Lord what shall I do ? I clapped my Hands together , I am ruin 'd , I am ruin 'd , Horse and Foot . When I was running up to the Officer , the Prisoner came out of the Alehouse , and met me in the same Street , opposite Somerset-Street ; when I saw him I was as much rejoiced to see him as he was to see me ; I suppose he thought I had got the Prize . When I saw him , I laid Hold of him , and said you Son of a B - h , I have caught you ; he said , what 's the Matter ? I said , G - d R - t you , you had like to have sent me to Newgate for nothing ; says the Prisoner , Newgate , for what ? You Son of a B - h , you have forg 'd a Note . Q . What said he upon that ? Whiteiag . He said hush , I would not have my Character stain 'd for ever so much ; I said , R - t you and your Character too . Q . What then ? Whiteing . Then I call 'd out Officer , Officer , and the Officer run , and the Porter run , and we brought him away . Q . Now to what Place did you bring him ? Whiteing . He wanted a Coach , but the Officer would not let him have a Coach . Q . To what Place did you carry him ? Whiteing . He desir 'd to go the back Way , and we did . When we came into Coleman-Street , he said he would not go into Mr. Nesbit 's , where he was known , for ever so much . We had him to the Swan I think in Coleman-Street , and Mr. Arnold Nesbit was sent for , and he came there ; what pass 'd then I ca n't tell , I came out . Q . Who was the Man that took the Prisoner by the Breast ? Whiteing . Myself , I took the Prisoner ; I have Occasion to know him , for he has been in my Thoughts Night and Day . Q . ( to John Wild , Constable ) Was you sent with that Porter that was last examin 'd , by Arnold Nesbit ? Wild . Mr. Nesbit 's Footman came and ask 'd for me ; I was at home ; he told me I must come up to Mr. Nesbit , and bring my Staff ; I begged he would step to a Neighbour that was a Constable , but he was not at home ; so I went , and when I came he charg 'd me with this Man ; said he must go to Newgate ; the Porter was surpriz 'd at first : Soon after he laughed , and said , I forged a Note , I can hardly write a Letter ! but he said he would endeavour to find the Man . Mr. Nesbit gave me an Order , if I did not find the Prisoner , I must secure him . I thought it was reasonable , what he ( the Porter ) said to us of going two and two ; accordingly , the Fellow went into the House , and came out again surpriz 'd ; says he , he is not there , & c. The Word was hardly out of his Mouth , but the Prisoner came up to him ; he laid hold of him , and said D - n you , I have got you . The Prisoner seem 'd surpriz 'd ; so we took him just by the Bars : He begged for Jesus 's Sake he might not be exposed , for he was of a very good Family . Q. I would ask you , was there any Discourse about forging a Bill ? Wild . I told him he was charg 'd with forging a Bill . Q . Did he pretend to say that he had not sent the Porter for the Bill ? Wild . He said he could soon clear that up , for he had it of one Johnson , so he pray 'd of me that I would not expose him , but take him in a Coach ; I did not know whether he would pay for it : I told him I would take him as private a Way as I could . When I came into Moorfields , he begg 'd I would go into some House , and said that he would rather go to Hell , than to go to Mr. Nesbit 's Compting-House , for there was not a Man there but knew him . I did not care to go into a Tavern , so I went into a little Alehouse , and sent to Mr. Nesbit to know if he would come there , or else I would bring him to his House . When I sent to Mr. Nesbit , he was at Dinner , and said he would come after he had din 'd . When Mr. Nesbit came , he behav 'd exceedingly submissive ; he begg 'd for Jesus 's Sake , for the Lord 's Sake , he walk 'd upon his Knees , he would not get up , and pray 'd for Jesus 's Sake that he would be favourable to him . Mr. Nesbit said , very likely he should ; he would consult his Attorney , and if it was necessary , it should be so . Q . ( to Nathaniel Crompton ) Do you remember at any Time the Prisoner 's endeavouring to make his Escape out of the Compter ? Crompton . Yes , Sir , on Monday the 6th of October , in the Evening , between Six and Seven ; he came to the Gate , and I observ 'd I had let in no Body in such Cloaths ; he came to the Gate in Women 's Cloaths . When I had let him out , I observ 'd it was a Man 's Face , with that I stopped him ; he was disguis 'd with Paint . When I had let him out , I lay 'd fast Hold of him by the Wrist : He offered me Money , I told him no Money should satisfy me , but he should go in again . I sent to my Mistress to have him taken Care of , and told him he should not go away to be undress 'd 'till Mr. Levi came home . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) You have heard what has been sworn against you to support the Prosecution , what have you to say for yourself ? Prisoner . This Bill , my Lord , I got from a Man call 'd Johnson ; he told me he had it from Bristol . He said he was quite unacquainted with what could be done with the Bill , and as it was my Business , he desir 'd that I would get it accepted for him ; he had it from Bristol : He said he had two other Bills ; he said he had it from one Mr. Leroch , of Bristol , and desired I would do what was necessary about the Bill ; this was on Tuesday Evening . I told him I thought it proper to send to Mr. Nesbit 's , to know if it was good ; then he took the Bill in his Hand , and said it was very well . [ The Substance of the Prisoner 's Defence was this ; that his Friend , Johnson , and him , were walking down Cheapside , and then turned into Lawrence Lane ; and Johnson sent the first Porter to Mr. Nesbit 's , but that he sent the other Porter from Whitechapel , by the Advice and Direction of Johnson . ] Guilty of uttering the Note , knowing it to be forged , but not Guilty of the Forgery . Death . Philip Jewel was indicted for stealing one Quart Silver Tankard , Value 5 l. 5 s. and one Silver Cup , Value 4 l. 10 s. the Goods of Robert Hill , of Swithins Lane . Q . ( to Robert Hill ) Have you lost any Thing lately ? Hill . Yes , my Lord , I lost a Silver Tankard , and a Silver Cup , that holds almost a Quart . Q . What was the Value of the Tankard ? Hill . I reckon 'd it about 5 l. 10 s. and the Cup 4 l. 10 s. Q . Where did you lose them from ? Hill . I lost them out of the End of the Grate ; they unwired about five of the Wires that binds the Grate round by the other main Wires to keep them together . Q . How do you know that they did this ? Hill . I ca n't say that I saw them ; I had good Customers in the Shop at the same Time , that I ca n't say that I saw them . Q . What Time of the Day was this ? Hill . A little before Twelve at Noon ; the two Fellows that stole them were taken , Jewel , and the Evidence , James Norril . Q . What then ? Hill . Then we , with the Constable , took them to the Compter . Q . After they were taken , was you sent for ? Hill . After they were taken , they were brought up to my Shop , and I sent for the Constable , and took them to the Compter . Q . What pass 'd when they came to your Shop ? Hill . They said nothing all that Time . About Seven or Eight o'Clock the Constable and another Neighbour went to them to the Compter , to whom they confess 'd several Things . About Eight o'Clock Jewel said if they sent for me , he would tell me what they had done with my Cup and Tankard . Q . And what did he tell you ? Hill . He told me he had sold the Cup and Tankard to a Jew in Houndsditch ( opposite the Gullyhole ) for four Guineas and a half . Prisoner . My Lord , please to ask him whether he minds the Jew 's Name . Hill . He nam 'd the Jew to me , and his Name was Cordozo . Q . ( to James Norril . ) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar ? Norril . Please you , my Lord , I work 'd at a House in Barnaby-Street , where the Prisoner lived before he was taken up . When Philip Jewel came home from Transportation , his Creature that he lived with lodg 'd there ; so he enquired her out , and came there ; he ask 'd me to go out with him , which I did . I was acquainted with him about a Week . Q . Where did you become acquainted with him ? Norril . At this Lodging-House in Kent-Street . Q . Did you do any thing together ? Norril . We went up Kent-Street Road . We came afterwards into Swithin's-Lane ; I had a Jews-Harp in my Hand , and he saw these Things in the Grate ; he ask 'd me to lend him the Jews-Harp , and he took it and broke about five of the Wires of the Grate with this Jews-Harp . Q . What did you see ? Norril . My Lord , I was coming up Swithin's-Lane , so he stopt ; I did not know what he was about 'till he took the Silver Cup and Tankard , and he put them under his Coat . Q . What did you do in the mean time ? Norril . I stood over the Way ; I did not know he was breaking the Grate . Q . What was the Intent of you two walking together ? Norril . My Lord , I have no Friends at all ; and I lodging at this House , he ask 'd me to go out to take a Walk , and drink Part of a Pint of Beer , and we happened to go to Swithin's-Lane , where he saw this Grate with the Plate in it . Q . Was any body in the Shop ? Norril . Yes , my Lord , that Gentleman , Mr. Hill . Q . Was any body in the Shop besides . Norril . My Lord , I ca n't tell . Q . How long was he about this ? Norril . About Half a Quarter of an Hour . Q . What did he do then ? Norril . He ty 'd it up in the Flap of his Coat , and carried it into Houndsditch to one Aaron Cordozo , and sold both for about 4 l. 14 s. Q . What did he do with the Money ; had you Part of it ? Norril . About a Guinea , my Lord . Q . Where did you go after that ? Norril . He would come past the same Door , Mr. Hill 's Door in Swithin's-Lane ; and when we got almost to the End of the Street there were two or three crying after us , Stop Thief ! and they laid hold of us . Q . Did they take you ? Norril . Yes , my Lord , they took us both . Q . What then ? Norril . Then they carried us to this Gentleman 's Shop , and then to the Compter , and the next Morning before the Alderman . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) Would you ask him any Question ? Prisoner . Ask him whether he stood on the other Side of the Way when I did this Fact . Court . He has sworn he did . Q . ( to Edward Gregory , Constable . ) What do you know of this Affair ? Gregory . On the 15th of September , on Monday , I think , about Four o'Clock in the Afternoon , I was sent for to Mr. Hill 's Shop , to take Charge of the Prisoner at the Bar and this James Norril ; I took them to the Compter , and I observed that they were obstinate , and I desired they might be kept apart , not to converse together . I went in the Evening with a Neighbour to the Compter ; I thought it was proper to go and see them ; and I went to this young one that is turn 'd Evidence . Q . What Time of the Night did you go to them ? Gregory . I believe it was about Seven or Eight . I ask 'd several Questions about this Fact , but he knew nothing of it he said . In about Half an Hour there came a Woman crying to see him ( the Prisoner at the Bar ; ) she told me her Name was Alice Beckstone ; she said , he should save his Neck by turning Evidence . Jewel , the Prisoner at the Bar , said , he and this James Norril went to Mr. Hill 's Shop , they broke open the Grate , and took out the Tankard and the Cup . Q . And what else did they say ? Gregory . That they sold it for four Guineas and a Half to a Jew ; I do n't remember that he knew his Name , but the young one said his Name was Cordozo , who lived over-against the Gully-Hole in Houndsditch . Q . Did he say any thing else ? Gregory . When he had made this Confession , I said I must search him ; he said , if I did , I should find nothing but a Jews-Harp . He said , in breaking the Wires of the Grate , he broke a Piece of the Jews-Harp , and he said , I believe if you go to look for it , you will find it there : He broke a Piece off , and he believed it fell down in the Street , at the Corner of the Shop Window ; he believed that we might find it there , if we went to look for it ; he said the Jews-Harp belong 'd to his Companion , James Norril . The next Morning a Neighbour of Mr. Hill 's and mine went to look for the Piece of the Jews-Harp , and found it . Q . ( to William Walter . ) What have you to say with respect to this Fact against the Prisoner ? Walter . My Lord , I went along with the Constable , about Seven o'Clock , to the Compter , to hear if we could find my Neighbour 's Plate . About Seven o'Clock the Prisoner at the Bar began to confess several Robberies ; at length he confess 'd about the Tankard and Cup ; he said he would not say any thing 'till the right Owner of the Goods was there ; and I immediately sent for Mr. Hill . Q . Well , did Mr. Hill come ? Walter . Yes , my Lord , he came presently . As soon as Mr. Hill came into the Room , the Prisoner said , that 's the Gentleman that we took the Cup and Tankard from ; he was sitting behind the Compter with his Spectacles on , selling some Rings to a Gentlewoman . Q . What then ? Walter . I ask 'd him , my Lord , what he broke the Wires of the Grate with ; he told me with a Jews-Harp , and said , if you look under the Grate where I broke the Wires off , there you will find a Piece of the Jews-Harp . Q . Did you at any Time go to look for it ? Walter . On the 16th in the Morning , about Six o'Clock , I got up and look 'd under the Grate , and here 's the Piece of the Jews-Harp which I found . [ The Jews-Harp and Piece were produced in Court , and they exactly tallied . ] Q . Who did he give the Jews-Harp to when he took it out of his Pocket ? Walter . The Constable had it , I saw him take it out of his Pocket . I went to Sir Edward Bellamy , and shew 'd him this Jews-Harp , and he said it was a very material Thing , I should be careful of it . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) What have you to say with respect to this Fact ? Prisoner . My Lord , I will throw myself up to the Mercy of the Court . Q . Have you any Witness ? Prisoner . No . Guilty , Death . 357. Mary Hope of Milk-Street , the 5th of October , being big with a certain Male Bastard Child , the said Male Child from her Body was brought forth alive , and the said Mary Hope not having the Fear of God before her Eyes , but being moved by the Instigation of the Devil , the aforesaid Bastard so alive , feloniously , willfully , and aforethought , did make an Assault upon , and with a certain Linnen Apron , into a certain Wooden Box , feloniously and willfully , by wrapping and solding the said Linnen Apron , the said Bastard Child did put , by which it was so suffocated that it died . Q . ( to William Aget . ) Sir , what do you know of this Matter ? Aget . The Prisoner at the Bar was my Servant . Q . Where do you live ? Aget . In Milk-Street . The Prisoner at the Bar was my Servant ; she had lived with me about four or five Months ; and on Sunday the 5th of this Instant October she came down Stairs with her Fellow Servant in the Morning , but finding herself indisposed , went up again . Q . Was you by when she came down ? Aget . No , my Lord , I was not up . When I came down , this was the Relation her Fellow Servant gave me . Court . What her Fellow Servant told you is nothing ; did you see her ? Aget . I did not see her 'till the Afternoon ; but about Nine o'Clock in the Morning ; I heard her cry out ; so I sent her Fellow Servant up to see what ail 'd her ; she brought me Word she was not well , and desir 'd to be indulged to lie abed . She would not sufler her Fellow Servant to stay in the Room as little Time as possible ; she bid her go about her Business , that she was better . This was what her Fellow Servant told me . My Duty call 'd me to Church ; when I came from that , I enquired how she did . Q . Had you no Suspicion ? Aget . Yes , Sir , that Cry gave me a Suspicion . My Servant told me she was much better , and intended to come down in the Afternoon . In the Afternoon she did come down , about Five o'Clock ; I saw her do her Business , light a Fire , & c. I then desired my Wife and the Witness , the other Servant , to go up into her Room ; there they saw what they thought was sufficient to convince them that there had been a Labour or something like it . Court . You did not go up into her Room ? Agit . I did not then . When they came to me , they said they were very sure there was a Labour , or something like it had been in that Room . She strongly denied it . When nothing could be found in the Room they look 'd in every Place where any Thing might be conceal 'd : My Wife insisted upon opening her Box ; she made some Difficulty and could not find the Key ; upon which I told her , her Mistress should have Satisfaction , and if the Key was not be found I would break the Box open ; accordingly I took her fellow Servant up with me and did break it open , and there , to my great Surprize , was a dead Child . Court . You saw it ? Aget . I saw it . Q . Did you look upon the Child , was there any Marks of Violence ? Aget . I saw none . I sent for the Constable and charg 'd him with her . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Would you ask Mr. Aget any Questions ? Prisoner . No . Q . ( to Dorothy Robinson ) Was you fellow Servant with the Prisoner ? Do you live at Mr. Aget 's ? Robinson . Yes Sir . Court . Give an Account of what you know of the Matter . Do you remember when she cry 'd out ? Robinson . It was about Nine o'Clock ; and I went up . Q . What Condition was she in ? Robinson . She complain 'd of being very ill , but did not tell me her Distemper . Q . Had you any Suspicion of her being in Labour ? Robinson . Yes , we thought so by her Screeking out , but she deny 'd it , and it went over . Q . Did she desire you to go down ? Robinson . Yes Sir , she desired me to go down , and I told my Mistress , and my Mistress went up and examin 'd her . Q . Was you with your Mistress then ? Robinson . No Sir , I was below . Q . Was you up any more ? Robinson . Yes , I went up several Times in the Day , and I ask 'd her how she did ; and she said she was better . Q . Did she always tell you that she was better ? Robinson . Yes , 'till she came down ; she said she would come down in the Afternoon . Q . What did she say when she came down ? Robinson . She said she was much better . Q . Did you go up Stairs with your Master and Mistress when the Child was found in the Box ? Robinson . Yes . My Mistress told her she was sure she had a Child , and she would examine ; so they broke open the Box and found the Child . Q . What was the Child , Male or Female ? Robinson . Male . Q . Did the Child seem to have any Marks of Violence ? Robinson . No Sir , we could not perceive any Marks of Violence about the Child . Q . Had she any Childbed Linnen ready ? Robinson . We examin 'd her Clothes and there was none to be found . Q . Are you skilful enough to know whether she went her full Time ? Robinson . My Lord here is the Midwife . Q . ( to Mary Jeyne ) Are you a Midwife ? Jeyne . Yes , my Lord . Q . What do you know of this Matter ? Jeyne . I was sent for on Monday was se'nnight . She was deliver 'd the Sunday before ; I was sent for to know if she was safely deliver 'd . I did not examine her , I examin 'd other Matters , and found she was safely deliver 'd . Q . Did you see the Child ? Jeyne . Yes my Lord . Q . Did you see any Marks of Violence on the Child ? Was it of its full Time . Jeyne . I believe it was , or very nigh , my Lord . Court . You that are a skilful Woman , do you think the Child was born dead , or came to any violent Death afterwards ? Jeyne . I saw no Marks of Violence : 'T is impossible for any Body to say it was born alive ; for want of Help in Time it might be suffocated , or another Way , thro ' the Naval String , or otherwise , & c. I turn 'd it before them all , and there were no Marks of Violence found . Q . Did you observe any Thing else . Jeyne . The Child look 'd just like another Child that should die a natural Death . Richard Wheatland . About Eight o'Clock on Sunday Evening , the 5th Instant , Mr. Aget came to me , seemingly in a very great Fright , he said I must go along with him . Q . What are you , a Constable ? Wheatland . Yes . As we were going down the Street together , he said his Maid was deliver 'd of a Child , and he believ 'd it was murder 'd . Q . What then ? Wheatland . I went up with Mr. Aget and his Wife into the Garret , where I saw the Woman sitting on the Bed , crying prodigiously ; I said to her , good Woman are you married ? she said yes she was . I says , what Provision have you made for the Birth of this Child ? none at all said she ; upon which I said to her , it was surprising to me that a married Woman should suffer herself to bring a Child into the World and have nothing to put it in ; tell me the Truth I says , are you married or not ? she crying still , said at last she was not ; I then ask 'd her again , have you nothing at all made for this Child , no Linnen whatsoever ? none at all she said : I ask 'd her who was the Father of the Child ; she said a Sailor . I ask 'd her what was become of him , she said he was gone to Sea : I afterwards saw the Child , my Lord , in this check 'd Linnen Apron . Mr. Aget gave me charge to take her in a Coach to the Compter , which I did , and went with her myself , my Lord , in the Coach , which Mr. Aget paid for ; I told the Deputy Keeper of the Compter to put her up warm , for she was deliver 'd that Morning : She declared that the Child was born dead , that is all that I know , Acquitted . 358.
