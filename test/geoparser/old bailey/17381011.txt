John Machell and Richard Wilkinson , were indicted for stealing two black Mares , value 20 l. the Goods of John Lucas , September the 16th . John Lucas . On the 14th of September , in the Night , I lost two heavy black Mares , out of my Grounds at Thollowson , in the Parish of Dunchurch , in Warwickshire ; and my Servants having Inform 'd me that two sorry Fellows had been lurking about the Ground the Evening before , I enquired of every one I met , if they had not seen two such Persons with two Mares , and was told they were gone towards London ; I followed them to St. Alban 's , where a Man told me he had seen them at Redbourn Wash , coming for London ; at the New-River-Head I heard of them again , and was informed they would certainly be push 'd into the Market for Sale ; upon this I went directly to Mr. Cleaver , in Smithfield , and searched the Toll-Book , and got a Friend to search the Inns about Smithfield and St. John's-Street , while my Landlord and I went to cross the Water , in order to look for them in the Borough , and just as we were going to take Boat , the Hostler came to us , and told us the Mares were found at the Pewter-Platter in St. John's-Street ; we returned with the Hostler , and saw them ; I am positive they are the same Mares that I lost from Thollowson ; as to the Prisoners , I can only say , they answer the Description my Men had given me of them ; I ca n't say I ever saw them before . Thomas Salter . Mr. Lucas and Mr. Cooper , ( a Neighbour of his ) came to me at the Rose and Crown , and desired me to enquire for two Fellows with a Couple of large black Mares . Accordingly , while Lucas went for the other Side of the Water , we enquired at the Golden Lyon , where we heard that the Mares had been there , but were carried to the Pewter-Platter , higher up the Street . We went thither , and found a Neighbour of mine , ( one Mr . Twist ) bargaining with the Prisoner Machell , for one of the Mares . I asked him whether the Mare was his own ? he said , yes ; and , says Mr . Twist , he asks Eight Guineas for her , and I will give but 5 l. Well , says I , let 's go in and drink do n't let 's have a dry Bargain ; so we went into the House , and I ask 'd him ( Machell ) if he had not another Mare , and if another Man was not concerned in the Property of the Mares ? he said , yes , - but his Partner was above Stairs , - a-bed . Then I went up to the other Prisoner ( Wilkinson ) and told him his Partner wanted him , and could not sell the Mares unless you come down . Are they yours , says I , yes , reply 'd Wilkinson , we bought them at Woburn Fair last Thursday , and gave Twenty Guineas for them . When Wilkinson came down to Machell , I asked them again about the Price they had paid for them , and they said Twenty Pounds or Guineas , I ca n't tell which . The two Prisoners answering the Description that Lucas had given of them , as exactly as if he had drawn their Pictures , we got a Constable who took them into Custody . We were confirmed in our Proceedings by the Keeper of New-Prison , who happening to be there , knew Machell , and told us he had been tried for such an Offence , but the very last Sessions . Machell told us before the other ( Wilkinson ) came down , that he bought them at Woburn Fair for 20 Guineas or 20 l. Lucas . The Prisoners were carried to the Justice , - before I got back to the Inn , where the Mares were found . James Gill . The Morning we found the Mares at the Pewter-Platter , Machell was talking to a Man about one of the Mares ; the other ( Wilkinson ) was a-bed , but was fetch 'd down Stairs . I thought it might be proper to part them , so I took Wilkinson into the Kitchen , and asked him some Questions , in answer to which , he said , he knew nothing of the Matter , nor from whence the Mares came ; then he said he bought them at Woburn Fair for Twenty Pounds , and they were his own ; and then Machell said he bought them himself . John Maxwell . On the 15th of September about 7 at Night , the two Prisoners brought the Mares into our Yard ; one rode one of them , and the other Man led in the other . On the one were two Saddles , the other had no Saddle but four Bridles . They bid me take Care of them , litter them and make them clean ; which of them in particular gave me this Charge , I can not take upon me to say , - they both came together , and gave me charge of them ; then they went into the House , and sent for me to drink with them , and Machell again bid me take Care of his Mares . My Master Jones coming in , I told him those two Men had two good Coach Mares ; - and I 'll be hang 'd then , says he , if they have not stole them . When the Prisoners were gone to Bed , he and I went to look at them , one was about four Years old , and the other about six . In the Morning my Master got Mr. Markham to come and look at the Mares , and I call 'd Machell to shew him one of them . He warranted the Mare to be sound ; and while Mr. Markham and he were talking together , this Gentleman ( Mr. Salter ) came in and sent for a Constable , and Mr. Cleaver sent after Mr. Lucas , and fetched him back . I went before Mr. Poulson to swear I received the Mares from the Prisoners . They told me I needed not give them any Corn , for they had given them as much as they would eat at Whetstone . This was on Friday Night , and the next Morning Mr. Lucas came and owned the same Mares , which the Prisoners over Night had given me Charge of . Machell . I was going down to Northampton , and met with this Wilkinson , and the two Mares . He told me he had bought them , and offer 'd to satisfy me if I would come with him to Smithfield Market to sell them . Wilkinson . He had none of the Mares from me . I met him at Newcastle under Line with them and a Sorrel Mare , which he swopp 'd away at Daventry , and afterwards it was claim 'd by another Man I had got 4 or 5 l. and thought to have got a Place , but I spent it with him , and he promised to pay me again when these two Mares were sold . Machell Guilty . Death . Wilkinson , Acquitted . 3. James Pain , alias Page , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling House of Henry George , in the Parish of St. Margaret , Lothbury , between the Hours of 12 and 4 in the Night , and stealing a Beaver Hat and crape Band , value 13 s. the Goods of the said George ; and a Velvet Manteel , value 15 s. a Velvet Hood , value 5 s. a cambrick Apron , val . 5 s. a cambrick Handkerchief , value 2 s. a muslin Tucker , val 6 d. a Tortoise-shell Snuff-box , val . 10 s. an Ivory Nutmeg-grater , val . 6 d. the Goods of Christiana Stedman . A Woman 's Scarlet Cloak , value 5 s. a black silk Hood lac 'd , val . 5 s. the Goods of Ann Williams , in the Dwelling-house of the said George . Henry George . On the 10th of September my Family and I had been abroad ; we came home about Seven at Night , and I being the last Person that went in , I took the Key from the outside of the Door , and put it into the Lock , on the inside , and latch 'd the Door , though I did not lock it . The House is in Catherine-Court , in Princes street , Lothbury . We sat 'till about 11 , and before we went to Bed , the Watchman beat past 9 , 10 , and 11 o'Clock very hard , and the Door did not open . When we went to Bed I bid the Maid make fast the Door , and I suppose the Watchman having beat at it , and she seeing the Key in the Lock , imagin 'd it was fast ; but a little after 4 in the Morning the Prisoner ( who is a Watchman , and was upon Duty that Night ) came up Stairs , with a Neighbour , to my Chamber , and told me , the Door of my House was wide open , and he thought proper to let me know it . I thanked him for his Care , and gave him 6 d. then I went down , and seeing the Brass and the Pewter standing as they did when I went to Bed , I fasten 'd the Door , and was going to my Chamber again ; but missing my Hat , ( worth about 12 or 14 s. ) I call 'd up my Family , and then we found one had lost one thing , and another , another Thing . I miss 'd nothing but my Hat ; and the next Morning a young Man came and told me the Prisoner had sold a Hat ; and that the Man who bought it , had pawn 'd it in Grub-street . I went to see it , and it prov 'd to be mine . When he was before the Lord Mayor , he said he found the Door open , and going in , he saw two Hats hang up , so being a poor Man he took one of them . The Hat was produced before the Lord-Mayor , and he confess 'd it was the Hat he took . Christiana Stedman . I liv 'd in the House with Mr. George , and lost on the 10th of September at Night , a Velvet Mantelet , worth 15 s. a Hood lac 'd , worth 5 s. a Cambrick Apron , worth 5 s. a Cambrick Handkerchief , 2 s. 6 d. a Tortoise-shell Snuff-box inlaid with Silver , 10 s. a Nutmeg Grater 6d . a Muslin Tucker , half made , 1s . By the Beadle 's Information I found the Mantelet , the Hood , Apron , and Handkerchief , at Mrs. Abdy 's in Grub street ; she keeps a Publick-House , and there the Prisoner had pawn 'd them , or sold them for 19 s. and I paid the Money for them . Ann Williams . I lost a scarlet Cloth Cloak that Night , worth a Crown , and a black silk Hood lac 'd , worth 5 s. I was present when the Cloak was found at Abdy 's , But the Hood I never had again . Margaret Follet On Monday Morning , Sept. 10 , about 4 o'Clock , the Prisoner call 'd out , and said , - here 's a Door open ; I bid him stay at the Door 'till I came down . He told me 't was not my Door , however I desir 'd him not to go from it 'till I came down . He did so ; and I found Mr. George 's Door wide open ; but as the Brass and Pewter was standing , I was in good hopes nothing was gone . The Prisoner and I went up Stairs to call Mr. George to shut his Door ; and he gave the Watchman 6 d. and thanked him for his Care ; but in an Hour or two afterwards I heard of these Losses . Forsby Cotton On the 11th of Sept . I heard that Mr. George had been robb 'd , and the Prisoner being suspected , I took him up before my Lord Mayor , who committed him to the Compter . Some Days after , I went to see him in Prison , and he told me , that several of the Things were at Mrs. Abdy 's , and own 'd he had taken them out of Mr. George 's House , himself . I inform 'd these Gentlewomen what I had heard , and went with them to Abdy 's , where we found the Things that have been mention 'd . As to the Things that are not found , he told us he knew nothing about them . Ellen Abdy . The Prisoner brought me a Velvet Manteel , a Hood , Handkerchief and Apron , and a scarlet Cloak , on the 11th of September , and pawn 'd them with me for 19s . He said they were his Wife 's , and that he bought them for her of a Man that ow 'd him Money , but as they wanted Money , to prevent her lying in the Street with a young Child he must dispose of them . So I let him have the Money , and afterwards these Gentlefolks came and claim 'd them . Thomas Gwyn . I am a Watchman in the same Ward with the Prisoner . The Morning after the Robbery was committed , I heard the Prisoner had sold a Hat , and found out the Person he had sold it to , who told me he was to give 6 Shillings and half a dozen of Beer for it . The Tortoise-shell Snuff-box and the Nutmeg-grater , I found the next Morning in a Closet in the Prisoner 's own Room , Mr. George and the Constable were present at the same Time . Mr. George confirm 'd these Circumstances . Richard Roberts . Last Monday was a Month , I bought a Hat of the Prisoner for 6 s. and 6 Penn'worth of Beer . As I had no ready Money to give him , I pawned it for 2 s. which I gave him in part of Payment . He told me 't was his own , and I was to have paid him the rest of the Money on Saturday Night . Prisoner . He did not give me the 2 s. I had but 18 d. I never was at that Stand before that Night , and was told that the Door was open by another Watchman , so I came with him to the Door , and pull 'd it close , telling him 't was only an empty House . Then I went away , and when I came again to beat my Rounds , I struck at the Door and it flew open . Mr. Cotton came to me in the Counter , and promised to give my Wife half a Guinea if I would tell him where the Things were , and when he had got what he could out of me , he gave her nothing at all . Acquitted of the Burglary , and Guilty of the Felony , 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 4. Lawrence Wyvell , was indicted for stealing 5 pair of small yarn Hose , value 3 s. the Goods of William Farrow , Sept. 23 . Susanna London . I live with Mr. Farrow in Hounsditch I do n't remember the Day of the Month , but 't was in the Morning about a Fortnight ago ; I was in the Room behind the Shop and heard a Noise in the Shop . When I came out , I found Mr. Jarvis ( the next Witness ) and the Prisoner in the Shop , and saw him take one or two Parcels , ( I ca n't tell which ) out of the Prisoner 's Hands ; but Mr. Jarvis charged him with taking 2 Parcels , which were both opened ; in one of them were 3 pair , and in the other 2 pair of Boys yarn Hose , which I know were Mr. Farrow 's Property , and were worth about 3 s. 3 d. He fell down upon his Knees , and begged he might be let go , and said it was the first Fact . Tho Jarvis . I saw the Prisoner go into Mr. Farrow 's Shop , and take 2 Papers of Stockings off the Shelf , and was going away with them , but I ran in and stopp 'd him , and took the two Parcels from him ; in both Papers were 5 pair of Stockings . He fell upon his Knees , and promised if I would let him go , he would never do so any more . Defence . I went into this Shop to enquire for one Mrs. Gill a Mantua-maker , and this Mr. Jarvis followed me , and said he saw me take the Parcels . The Jury acquitted him . 5 , 6. John Fosset alias Powell , and William Sylvester , of St. George 's Middlesex , was indicted for assaulting Jane Hussey in the King 's Highway , putting her in Fear , & c. and taking from her a silver Thimble , value 1 s. and 8 d in Money , Sept. 5 They were a 2d Time indicted for assaulting Henry Southall on the King 's Highway , & c. and taking from him 6 s. in Money , Sept. 5 . They were a 3d Time indicted for assaulting Mary Arkin on the King 's Highway , and taking from her a linnen Handkerchief , value 6 d Sept 5 . Mrs. Hussey . On the 5th of Sept . I took Coach at Night with Mr. Southall , and Mrs. Arkin at Pye-Corner , to go into Princes-Square in Ratcliff-Highway : 't was 11 o'Clock by that Time we turn 'd into the Square . Before we got to our Door , 2 Men came with Pistols , - one on each Side of the Coach , and having stopp 'd it , they demanded our Money , Watches and Rings in a Minute , or else they would kill us . To the best of my Knowledge , Sylvester is the Man who was on the Side of the Coach where I sat , I take him to be the Man by his Apparel , Stature and Voice . By his Size I believe Powell to be the Person that was at the other Door . Sylvester was the Man to whom I deliver 'd a silver Thimble , worth 1 s. and 6 d. in Silver , and about 2 Penn'orth of Half-pence , for Fear of my Life . I can say more to Sylvester than I can to Powell , for it was dark , and there was no Lamps , nor any Moon ; but there was a Light from a Window in a House No . 9 and a Maid came to light 2 Gentlemen out of Doors at No . 6 , by which Means I was able to distinguish Sylvester 's Face . I never saw him after he had robbed me , 'till I saw him at Justice Farmer 's , and there I said he was the Man , to the best of my Knowledge ; for when the Light was come to the Door at No . 6 , they stood some Minutes , and the Gentlemen who were at that Door were coming to our Assistance , but they bid the Coachman drive on , and they ran away . Powel . Were they Englishmen or Irishmen that robbed you ? Mrs. Hussey . I think they were Englishmen , they spoke like such . Joseph Hatton , Coachman . On the 5th of Sept. at Night , I was called to carry these two Gentlewomen and Mr. Southall from Pye Corner to Princes-Square . As I turned out of Ratcliff-Highway , I observed two Men following the Coach , and I had not gone far into the Square before they took hold of the Horses , and each of them presenting a Pistol , they said if I stirred an Inch they would shoot my Brains out . Then they went up , ( one on each Side ) to the Coach Doors , and demanded the Gentlefolks Money , & c. or their Lives were gone in a Minute ; while they , were robbing the Coach , a Maid opened a Door , with a Candle to light two Gentlemen out . Then I jumped off my Box , and Mr. Southall got out of the Coach , but the Prisoners ran away and got off . It was dark , and there was no Moon , but it was very Starlight , and the Candle coming out close to the Coach , I took a great deal of Notice of them . Sylvester stood at the off Door , and Powell at the near Door ; I am positive and sure that the Prisoners are the Men . After this , Mr. Brown 's Chariot was stopped in the Street , and he having got the Prisoners into New Prison , he found me out , and desired me to go and see if I knew them . I went thither , and found 40 or 50 Men and Women in the Yard , whether they were all Prisoners or not I ca n't tell , but the Minute I went in , I saw Sylvester sitting upon a Bench , smoaking a Pipe ; Powell was at Pitch-farthing , and I immediately said they were the Men . They were both of them in Irons indeed , but there were more in Irons beside them . Jury . We would ask whether he knew them by their Voices , or directly upon the Sight of them ? Hatton . The People belonging to the Prison did not know what Business I came upon , nor had any one said a Word to me before I pitched upon the Prisoners . I knew them by Sight ; - and by their Cloaths . Powell . He came into the Prison not like a Man that would do Justice . He came and took no Notice at all of his Business there , till he was going out . Please to ask him if he did not ask a Creature in the Yard , who were the Men that were there , on Suspicion of robbing a Coach ? Haiton . There was a Woman there who asked me to give her a Pot of Beer , and I did so , but it was after I had pointed to the two Prisoners . Henry Southall . I was in the Coach when 't was robbed in Princes-Square . It stopping suddenly at No . 8 . I put my Head out to bid the Coachman drive to the next Light , and immediately a Man came up to me , with his Hat in one Hand , and a Pistol in the other , and cry 'd d - mn your Bloods you are all dead , if you do n't deliver your Watches and Money this Minute . Powell ( I think ) is the Man that was on my Side of the Coach , and I sat on the left Hand Side . I do n't swear possitively , I only say I believe in my Conscience he was the Man ; for he was by me a good while , and gave me 2 or 3 Jobbs on the Belly with his Pistol . As to Sylvester , I can say nothing to him , I am more positive to Powell , for when he had got what he could , he want off a little Way , and then came back again , and told us we had not given him all we had about us . When I heard that Mr. Brown 's Coachman had taken two Men for robbing his Coach , I went to New Prison , and the Keepers Wife had about 8 or 10 call 'd up ; - most of them were in Irons , but I did not much mind that , I looked only at their Faces ; and as soon as ever they came up , I said , - Madam I need not give you any farther Trouble , I believe I see the Man that robbed me ; and when they were examined before Justice Farmer , I pick 'd Powell out again , and said , - he was the Man . Powell . Please to ask him if he did not say before the Justice , that the Men who robb 'd the Coach were Irishmen , and were taller and bigger Men than we are ? Mr. Southall . No , I said no such Thing ; for they damn 'd and cursed so fast , that I could not distinguish what Countrymen they were . Mary Arkin . I was in the Coach at the same Time the 2 Men came up to it . Sylvester I take to be the Man who was on my Side of the Coach . I really believe him to be the Person , from the View I had of him by a Light which I saw at a Distance ; I took Notice of his Face , and of his Cloaths ; he had then on the same brown Coat that he wears now . I take Powell to be the Man who was on the other side the Coach by his Stature , he had on a brown Wig , and a lightish coloured Coat , - not the same he has on now . As soon as they came up to us , they cryed d - mn you , your Money , Watches and Rings in a Minute . I charged Sylvester with being the Man that was on our Side , when I saw him before the Justice . Defence . John Miller I am Turnkey of New-Prison ; when Hatton the Coachman came to the Goal , he called for a Tankard of Beer , and spoke to a Prisoner ; what he said to her I ca n't tell . I asked him who he wanted , and he told me he came to see the 2 Men that were here , on Suspicion of robbing the Coach in Ratcliff-Highway . Let them have fair Play , says I , and called the Prisoners , I believe 7 or 8 of them were ironed , and these 2 Men in particular were double iron 'd . I bid him be sure , for their Lives were depending ; upon which he looked round , and pointing to Sylvester , he said , I believe that Man is one . I bid him again be sure , and he asked me whether I would have him say wrong . Then turning himself round , he pitched upon Powell and said , he was the other . I again bid him be sure ; upon which he said . - let who will have done the Robbery , these Men shall suffer for it ; - I have been accused of it , as if some of my Consorts had done it , and to clear my self , they shall suffer for it . There was another Coachman with him , and he peep 'd thro ' the Checquers in the Gate , and said he wanted to see the two Men that had robbed his Coach . Tho Lander . I keep the Suttling House in New-Prison , and saw Hatton when he came to the Prison . He has but one Eye , and I know him again . He came directly into my House , and call 'd for Beer , and for one or two of the Women Prisoners ; and I heard him ask them in the Yard , ( not in the House ) which were the Men that came in on Suspicion of robbing the Coach ? The Women told him they were the Men which were double-iron 'd . Q . Was this Discourse between Hatton and the Women , before , or after he had pitch 'd upon the Men ? Lander . I did not apprehend he had pitch 'd on them before . I saw him when he came first into the Prison , and the two Prisoners were then walking about the Yard . I saw neither of them sitting ; Sylvester was smoaking , and both he and Powell were walking about . He pitch 'd upon them , when the Prisoners were call 'd together , but they were both double iron 'd . Jury . We desire to know , if he saw the Coachman as soon as he came in at the Gate ? Lander . I did not see him come in at the outer Gate ; but I saw him and another Man come in at the inner Gate , - the checquer 'd Gate . Here 's one of the Women he spoke to , before the Prisoners were call 'd up . Cordelia Taylor . 'T is common for People in Jail to stand at the checquer 'd Gate , to see if any of their Acquaintance comes ; and seeing Hatton , I knew him , and asked him to give me something . He asked me which were the Men that robbed the Coach ? I told him they were double iron 'd . Aye , says he , here they are , and right or wrong I will swear against them , or else I shall come into bad Bread . He said nothing else , - only that he did not know them ; and this Discourse was before he saw them . Jury . How long might Hatton be in the Yard before he went into the Tap-house ? Taylor Half a quarter of an Hour . Jury . Because Lander swore he came directly from the Gate into the Tap-house , and call 'd in the Women . Taylor . This Discourse was before he went into the Tap-house ; and after this I went with him into the Tap-house , but I did not change a Word with him there . Lander was by , ( in the Yard ) when this Discourse pass 'd and he might hear it . He was present when Hatton said he would swear against them , right or wrong , and I believe heard us all the Time . There was a Man came in at the Gate with him , but he walked towards the Tap , while we talked together . Eliz Fosset , ( the Mother of Powell alias Fosset ) I live in Whitechapple , and that 's about a Mile cross the Fields from Ratcliff Highway - Jury . 'T is not above half a Mile . Fosset . From the last Day of August to the 7th of September , my Son was at home every Night from Night-fall to next Morning . I have but one Room , and my Bed and my Daughter 's is in the same Room . 'T is a Cellar , into which we go down 3 or 4 Steps . He had an Ailment upon him , which made it improper for him to continue on Board his Ship , so he came home , and I 'ointed him every Night ; he lay in my Daughter 's Bed ; she lay with me , and if he went to sleep , he could not go out of the Room without my Knowledge , I am sure of it , - from the Bottom of my Heart . Ellen Fosset . The Prisoner , Fosset , is my Brother ; he lay in my Bed , on Sunday Night , Monday , Tuesday , and Wednesday Nights ; my Mother was curing him of a Distemper , and he was at home on Thursday Night too , and was 'nointed for his Rash . I do n't know what Month this was , nor the Days of the Month , nor how long it was after this , that he was taken up . - I have no Learning , but I know he was a-bed every Night before I came from Work , and I always left him a-bed in the Morning when I went out . Joshua Snowden . I went with Hatton to New-Prison ; he went thro ' both Gates , and shew 'd me Sylvester smoaking a Pipe , and Powell , at the farther End of the Yard , pitching Half-pence , and told me they were the Persons that stopp 'd his Coach . I did not see him speak to any Woman , before he fix 'd upon the Prisoners ; but afterwards we went into the Tap-house and had a Pot of Beer , and then he spoke to a Woman and made her drink . I was with him all the Time , and did not hear him say any thing like what Lander and Taylor has sworn . He only said , - they were the Men . Richard Anthony was likewise with Hatton and Snowden at New-Prison ; he confirm 'd exactly their Evidence , and said , that Hatton shew 'd them the two Prisoners before he spoke to any Body . He denied that Hatton expressed any Resolution to hang them right or wrong . Then they were tried on the Second Indictment . Henry Southall gave the same Account as in the former Trial , adding , that he was on the left Hand Side of the Coach , with his Face towards the Horses ; that upon the Prisoners demanding their Money , he gave 6 , 8 , or 10 s into the Person 's Hat , who was at the Door , next to which he sat ; and though there was a Light standing in a Window , yet he rely 'd not on that , but rather distinguish 'd the Man 's Face by the Light of the Night , because it was very near his own for some Time ; and as the Attack was on the East Side of the Square , he had more Light into the Coach over the Gardens , by which he discern 'd Powell 's Face , and thought him to be the Man who attacked that Side on which he sat . He deposed , that Powell curs 'd and swore so incessantly , that he took Notice of none but him . And that when he was before Mr. Farmer , Powell declar 'd he was on Board the Chester Man of War , on the 5th of September , when the Robbery was committed ; but afterwards he seemed to be in Doubt , whether the Prisoner mentioned the 5th of Sept. or no . Hatton the Coachman , gave his Evidence as before . He added , that Sylvester was on the right Hand Side of the Coach , next the Light which the Maid brought to the Door , and that Powell was the first that laid hold of the Horses . He was asked again , ( and was reminded that he was on Oath ) whether he spoke to any one in New-Prison , before he pitched upon the Prisoner ? His Answer was , that he spoke to no one , 'till he fix 'd on them ; and as for Cordelia Taylor , he never spoke to her at all . The Prisoner asked Hatton , if he had no Discourse with the Captain 's Wife , between the Gates of the Prison ? and he said he only desired to be let in , and that was all . Mrs. Hussey and Mrs. Arkin spoke as on the former Indictment . William Bolt , William Purey , and Tho . Moore , gave Sylvester the Character of an honest , poor , working Fellow . Moore said , he had been faulty on some Occasions , but he did not know that he had been guilty of Thieving . Powell 's Mother was sworn again , and begun with her Son 's extraordinary good Character , and gave much the same Account as before . She was asked , if she could remember the Day of the Month on which he was taken up ? She answered , she could not recollect that , - only she remembered , - it was the Monday after the 7th of September . She was farther asked , whether he lay in her Room from the 7th of September , to the 11th ( which was the Day he was taken . ) And she could not say he did . Ellen Fossett , ( the Sister ) spake as before , and could not ascertain the Time of her Brother 's coming for Cure from the Ship , nor of his Continuance in her Mother 's Room . - He might lye there ( she said ) about a Week , - then ( she said ) about a Fortnight , but he could not go out , because she lay at the Foot of her Father and Mother 's Bed , and he could not go out ( after he was in Bed ) without going over their Bed , and though he had gone softly , she must have heard him . She remembered particularly his being anointed by her Mother with Brimstone and Hog's-Lard , every Night . Mr. Southall . Mrs. Fossett came to speak to me about her Son , and to beg that I would be favourable . She told me if I would transport him , she would fall down on her Knees , and pray for me every Time she came by my Door . I told her I did not like to be robb 'd with a Pistol ; no , my dear Honey , said she , you are mistaken , - he never robb 'd with a Pistol in his Life . Why , how did he use then to rob , says I ? He seldom robbs on Land , said she ; most of the Robberies that he has committed were upon the Water . On Sunday I met the Beadle of the Parish ( Mr. Blowfield ) and I found by him he had a bad Character , - that of a Robber . Fossett ( the Mother . ) I did go to Mr. Southall , and asked him if he could charge my Son with any Thing ( dissaffected ? ) he told me he had robbed him , and mentioned Pistols . - I do n't believe he knows how to handle a Pistol ; - however , I said , - if you ca n't be off from it , but must swear against him , - rather than let him die a shameful Death , endeavour to transport him . Upon each Indictment both Guilty . Death . The Prisoners were not tried upon Mrs. Arkin 's Indictment , which was the Third . 7. Joseph Ward , was indicted for stealing 5 Oxen , val . 35 l. the Property of Ambrose Waugham , October 5 . Jasper Garret . I brought twelve Beasts ( Oxen ) to Coney , last Wednesday was se'nnight , and put them into a Field belonging to Richard Holt , at the Sign of the Cock , between three and four o'Clock in the Afternoon ; another Man drove in 14 , at the same Time . The next Morning the Man and I got up between 2 and 3 o'Clock to drive them out . But when we came into the Field , - out of the 26 we could find but 3 . Upon this we rid round the Field , to a Gate where we could perceive by the Track , they had been driven out ; so we follow 'd the Track as well as we could , 'till we came to Barnet ; from Barnet we rode to Whetstone , and were informed by the Man at the Turnpike , that the Beasts went thro ' there that Morning , and that among them was a white Bullock , which belong 'd to me . Hearing this , we rode to Finchley Common , and met the Field-Keeper at the Pied Bull at Islington , he had seen the Cattle upon the Road , and directed us after them . We follow 'd , and met this Man ( John Whitaker ) who had likewise seen them , and told us he would ride after them ; he did so , and took the Prisoner with the Oxen , just on the other Side the Half-Way House to Holloway . I was within Sight of them , when they were taken , and knew them to be Mr. Waugham 's , by the Mark , which was 2 Clips on each of their Thighs . The Prisoner told me ( and he said the same Thing before the Justice ) that he was hired to drive them to Mile-End . John Whitaker . I met the Prisoner with the Beasts between 5 and 6 o'Clock on Thursday Se'nnight in the Morning : He told me he was driving them to the other Side of London . As I was coming home I met Garret , and he enquired after his Cattle . I told him I had met a Man driving 5 Beasts , with his Master 's Mark on them , towards London . God bless your Soul , says he , ride after him , says he . I did so , and took him a little o ' this Side the half Way-House to Holloway . While I was talking to him , Garret came up , and I gave him Charge of the Prisoner . Tho Maltby . I met the Prisoner with the five Beasts on the other Side Highgate , and to the best of my Remembrance he told me they were his own ; that he lay with them the Night before , at Kick 's End , and was going with them beyond London . James Barnes latch 'd and pinn 'd the Gate ( in the Field ) thro ' which they were driven . Prisoner . A Gentleman at Whetstone hired me to drive them to Highgate , and told me if I did not see him there , I must drive them to the Globe at Mile-End . Mr. - Finch , Richard Byhold , Moses Netherwood , and Richard Waters , gave the Prisoner a good Character . Acquitted . 8. Thomas Jones , alias Brown , was indicted for privately stealing a Gold Watch , val . 23 l. a Cornelian Seal , set in Gold , value 20 s and a Steel Chain , val . 6 d. from the Person of Joseph Jackson , Sept. 9 . Mr. Jackson . On the 9th of Sept. about 7 at Night , or about 7 or 8 Minutes after , I was coming over the Bridge : The first House upon the Bridge from Southwark , on the Right Hand , is a Paper-Shop , kept by the Widow Stone , - ( a very honest good Woman ) and the next is an empty House , here there was a little Stop , and the Prisoner gave 3 great , hearty Jumps at me , and jump 'd upon me : I could not tell what he jump 'd at , - but he jump 'd my Watch out of my right Fob , with his left Hand . I miss 'd it that Minute ; he sprang on the other Side of the Way , and I cry 'd out stop Thief . I felt it go out of my Pocket , and saw him run away to a Lamp on the other Side of the Way , 3 or 4 Doors from 'Squire Brooks 's . Two other Men were with him , but who they were I ca n't tell . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man : it was not then dark ; so I had the Benefit of the Day-light and the Moon too , and I saw his Face , as much as I desire to see the Face of any Man in my Life . He was exactly in the same Cloaths ( upon my Oath ) that he is in now . The Watch he robb 'd me of , was worth 23 l. the Seal a Guinea , and the steel Chain , ( Diamond-cut ) was worth a Shilling , - but it cost more . When I saw him run away , I cry 'd heartily out after him , but he got through the Gate , into the Burrough , and I heard nothing of him 'till he was taken as a Gambler , ( or Money Dropper ) the Tuesday following . For being in Trouble and Distress for my Watch , and for my being so unjustly serv 'd , I went to Mr. Bird , and told him my Trouble . Says Bird , as you 're an old Friend , we 'll leave Notes of Description at Bridewell , New-Prison , the Marshalsea & c. of this good Man ; and he being taken on Tuesday for Gambling , he sent Mr. Bushel , an Apothecary in St. Paul 's Church-yard , to the Compter with me , and I told the Man that tends the Prison , I did not want to hurt any body , but the Man that I meant , was a little taller than I , about 26 Years old , in a light brown Coat , with a slit Sleeve , and a chitterling Shirt . When I saw him , I knew him to be the Man , and here are 2 Witnesses , that I then declared him upon my Sacred Oath to be the Person that robb 'd me . On Tuesday , I waited upon my Lord-Mayor , and he was so worthy and so good , as to give me a Warrant of Detainer against him . After that , I brought 3 or 4 Gentlemen of Credit to see him , and then I said again he was the Man ; and now I will swear the same to the Day of my Death . Prisoner . What Stockings had I on ? - if you saw me , and took such Notice of me , why did not you stop me ? Jackson . When you say this you say but little ; because I did cry stop Thief , and you sprang away before I could lay hold of you . Prisoner . You say you knew all my Cloaths , - what Stockings had I on ? Jackson . I am sure you had a good - Stock of Impudence . John Hudson . The 9th of last Month , between 7 and 8 at Night , I was going over the Bridge , and at the farther End I saw 3 or 4 People bustling together , and wondered what they were doing . But presently out ran a middle sized Man , and Mr. Jackson cry 'd out stop Thief , that Fellow has got my Watch . The Man ran off , and Mr. Jackson took me into Mrs. Stone 's Shop , and I told him where I liv 'd . He carry 'd me afterwards to the Compter to see the Prisoner , but as I did not see his Face when the Thing was done , I could not swear to him . I can only say 't was such a Siz 'd Man . John Nicholson . When Mr. Jackson came to the Compter , he described the Prisoner before he had seen him , and when he ( the Prisoner ) was brought to him , he down 'd on his Knees , and said , - by the living God that is the Man . Prisoner . Ask him if he knows that I have been in any Compter before ? Nicholson I have seen him before , I have known him 2 or 3 Years by Sight . - If I must speak , - I know he has a very bad Character . William Whitaker . I went with Dr. Jackson to the Compter , where he described the Man , and when he saw him , he said - as God should save him , that was the Man . I asked the Prisoner what Business he followed ? He told me he was a Servant to Mr. Leeson at the George in Belton-Street , Long-Acre . Prisoner . I was at Home all that Evening from 6 o'Clock . John Hall . I was at Mr. Leeson 's House on Saturday the 9th of Sept. ( I believe ) and saw the Prisoner come in between 6 and 7 in the Evening ; he sat till between 8 or 9 o'Clock , then he took a Candle off the Bar , and went up to Bed . I have known him 5 or 6 Years , and as to his Character - Prisoner . There is no need of his speaking about that . Hannah Tooley . I am a Servant of Leeson 's ; on Saturday the 9th of Sept. he came Home to our House , between 6 and 7 at Night , and sat down till between 8 and 9 , then he took a Candle off the Kitchen Dresser , and went up Stairs to Bed . We keep a Publick House , and tho ' we have a good many People coming in and out , yet I remember the Prisoner 's coming in that Night , because he was taken up on the Tuesday following . I never observed any Thing but Civility by him since I have been in the House , and I have lived with Leeson about 10 Weeks in all , - and about 3 or 4 Weeks , before this Fact was committed . John Leeson swore to the same Effect . Mr. Whitaker . On the Prisoner 's telling me in the Compter that he was a Servant to this Leeson , I went and enquired at the House concerning him . This Tooley told me she knew nothing at all of him ; and I said 't was a little odd , the Fellow should send me to People that did not know him ; he is in the Compter ( says I ) for Gambling , and on Suspicion of stealing a Watch ; they then asked me what Time the Robbery was committed ? I told them I could not tell exactly the Time ; but then this Tooley recollected him , and said she would make Oath he came in about half an Hour after 8 o'Clock , and seeming to be uneasy , he took a Candle and went up to Bed . Leeson was asked what Name the Prisoner went by ? He answered , sometimes by the Name of Tho . Brown , and sometimes Tho . Jones . Guilty , Death . 9. Edward Frith , of St. Dunstan , Stepney , Mariner , and Merchant , was indicted , for that he being indebted to George Halfhide , in the Sum of 100 l. on the 9th of Nov. in the 8th Year of his Majesty 's Reign , became a Bankrupt , and a Commission of Bankruptcy being duly awarded against him on the 16th of May , he , the said Frith , on the 23d of the said Month , was by the Commissioners declared a Bankrupt ; and on the 27th of May , Notice in Writing was left at the Prisoner 's Dwelling-house at Stepney Causeway , that he had been declared a Bankrupt , and that he was required to surrender himself to the Commissioners on the 3d and 13th of June , and on the 18th of July following , at 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon at Guild-hall , and submit to be examined , and to conform to the Directions of the said Act . And afterwards on the 27th of May , Notice was published in the Gazette ( as aforesaid ) for the said Frith to surrender himself to the Commissioners at Guild-hall , and make a Disclosure of his Effects , & c. And afterwards on the 30th of June , Charles Lord Talbot , then Ld . High Chancellor , did enlarge the Time for the said Frith 's surrendering and disclosing his Effects for 50 Days , to be computed from the 8th of July . And afterwards , on the 12th of July , 1737 , Notice was given in the Gazette , that the Lord High-Chancellor had enlarged the Time for the said Frith to surrender , & c. and he the said Frith was therein required to surrender himself , & c. But he the said Frith lightly regarding the Laws , & c. feloniously made Default , and neglected to surrender himself to be examin 'd , & c. against the Form of the Statute , & c. The Councel for the Prosecution having open 'd the Indictment , it was objected on the other Side , that the Act required , Notice should be given , that the Statute was awarded and issued ; every one knowing there is a material Difference between - awarded and issued ; the one signifying , the Thing order 'd to be done , the other , the Thing done : Whereas in the Indictment , they had only made use of the Word , awarded . It was objected further , that the Act says , the Bankrupt shall surrender to the Commissioners , or the major Part of them ; instead of which , in one of their Notices , they spun out their Directions for the Prisoner to surrender to all the five Commissioners , leaving out the Words , - or the major Part of them . And in the other Notice they say he must surrender to 3 of them , without mentioning any of the rest . It was objected likewise , that there should have been an Averment in the Indictment , that the Commissioners did sit , and that those Commissioners should have been nam 'd . whereas they were not nam 'd in their Notice , and they had only set forth that he was required to surrender to the Commissioners at Guildhall ; which might as well be understood of the Commissioners of Sewers , or of the Lieutenancy for they sit at the same Place . Acquitted . 10. Lambert Hammond , was indicted for stealing a Pair of Brass moulding Flasks , value 6 s. a copper Boiling-pan , val . 24 s. a mourning Sword , val . 12 d. a 10 lb . Brass Weight , value 10 s. and a brass straining Weight , val . 10 s. the Goods of Francis Knelms . Sept. 8 . Mr. Knelms . The Prisoner was my Servant , and went on Errands , and open 'd and shut Shop . I lost a copper Boiling-pan , in August last , and the Beginning of September I tax 'd him with it ; he own 'd he took it , and made no Excuse . Prisoner . My Master has entrusted me several Times with considerable Sums of Money . Mr. Knelms . I had a good Character of him , when I took him , - only I heard he was a little light-finger 'd , in such Things as a little Tea , & c. But he confess 'd all the Things in the Indictment , and by his Direction we found them at the Pawnbrokers . Edward Ryland , Constable , depos 'd , the Prisoner , when he took Charge of him , own 'd he took all the Things mention 'd in the Indictment , and told where he had pawn 'd them . Prisoner . My Master told me , if I would confess , I should go about my Business . Mr. Knelms . I promis 'd I would be favourable ; but my Meaning was , that I would save him from being hang 'd . Tho Harrison swore the Prisoner brought one of the Weights , the Boiler , and the Flasks , to him to pawn , and was positive he was the Man . The Court reprehended the Pawnbroker for taking in such Things from the Prisoner , and he , in Excuse of himself said , the Prisoner had used the Shop before , and he thought the Goods were his own . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 11. Lucy Brooks , was indicted for stealing a large Silver Cup , val . 5 l two silver Spoons , value 8 s. a silver Tea Spoon , val . 2 s a Gold Necklace and silver Locket gilded , val . 3 l. the Goods of John Williams , in his Dwelling-house , September 29 . Mary Williams . Last Quarter-Day , I happen 'd to be at Mr. Ball 's a Cane Chair Maker 's in the Minories , and this Gentlewoman at the Bar came in , and enquired for a Woman , with whom she wanted to board ; and she told me she had something coming in yearly , and would board with me if I pleased I told her , I would ask my Husband , when I went home , if he car 'd to take a Boarder . In the Afternoon she came , and I shew 'd her a Room above Stairs , where there was a corner Cupboard , in which we kept our Plate ; I open 'd it , to shew her the Cupboard , and lock 'd it again , ( all the Plate was then in it ) and having some Business to do in Seething-Lane , I went out , and left her in the Room below Stairs . When I came back the Prisoner was gone , but I did not miss the Plate 'till 11 o'Clock ; we were then going to Bed ; then I observ 'd a Policy of Insurance , which was in the Cup , to lie in the Window ; upon this I look 'd in the Cupboard , and miss 'd all the Things mention 'd in the Indictment . Ann Griffiths . When my Mistress ( Williams ) was gone out , the Prisoner went up Stairs with me into the Garret , to help me tie up some Lines , while we were there , she ask 'd me for a Chamber-pot ; I told her there was one in my Room , and she went down again by herself ; after this she wanted Snuff : I said , if she would go down and sit by the Kitchen-Fire 'till I had done , I would fetch her some , but when I came down she was gone , I stepp 'd to the Chandlers Shop at next Door , and there I found her ; she told me she was only going to see her Mother at the Tower , and would come again , but she never did . She did not stay long in the Garret with me , but went down a Quarter of an Hour before me . Philip Wilson . The Prisoner was taken in Bishopsgate street , on the 2d of Oct. and was carry 'd to the Tower Goal . Next Morning I went to her there , and she told me she had sold the Necklace to Mr. Barnes on the other Side Ludgate for 25 s. and the Cup and the Spoons for 4 l. to Mr. Spring on this Side Charing Cross . I went to them both , and they readily told me , they had bought such Things , and there we found them . She offered to go with us herself to the Places if we would give her a Coach . Mr. Barnes . The latter End of Sept. this Neck-lace was brought to me by a Woman in a Coach , she gave it me to weigh ; I told her what it came to , and sent the Money to her ( in a Coach ) by my Boy . I ca n't swear to the Prisoner . Smedley Moore confirmed Mr. Barnes 's Evidence , and swore positively the Prisoner was the Person who was then in the Coach , and to whom he carry 'd the Money . Mr. Spring swore , that his Servant fetched him from a Neighbour 's House the latter End of Sept . When he came Home he found a Coach at his Door , and the Cup and Spoons upon the Counter ; that he weigh 'd them , and carry 'd the Money for them to the Woman in the Coach , but as it was Candle-light , he could not swear to her . Henry Davis spoke to the same Effect , with Philip Wilson . Mr. Williams swore the Goods were his , and gave the same Account of the Prisoner 's Confession in the Goal , with Davis and Wilson . Prisoner . My Witnesses are all out of Town , and all I have to say is , that I know nothing about these Things . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 12. William Robinson , of Stoke Newington , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of Richard Rose , between 11 and 12 at Night , and stealing a linnen Sheet , value 2 s. 2 linnen pillowbiers , value 1 s. 2 pair of leather Boots , value 1 s. a pair of Shoes , value 1 s. 6 d. and other Things , the Property of Joseph Buxton , and a pair of Shoes , the Goods of a Person unknown , Sept. 12 . It appeared from the Evidence , that the Prisoner had been employed as a Journeyman to Buxton , ( the Prosecutor ) in mending Shoes , about 11 or 12 Weeks . That the 12th of Sept. Buxton went out between 10 or 11 at Night to the Alehouse , having locked the Door , and fastened the Window Shutters of his Shop , ( or Room ) which was in Mr. Rose 's House . That he returned between 11 and 12 , and saw the Window-shutter down , and the Prisoner ( whom he knew immediately ) with a Bag of Goods and a Bandbox . That he called to him by Name , and ran 12 score and 17 Lengths of his Oaken walking Stick after him , crying out , - Murder , - Thieves ; but the Prisoner got off .

Prior 's , where they were found accordingly . Guilty Felony only . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 13. John Wells , alias King , was indicted for stealing 45 lb . of Lead , value 3 s. fixed to the Dwelling-house of Richard Bridgman , Sept. 21 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 14. Elizabeth Ward , alias Butler , was indicted for stealing a Silk Damask Night Gown , value 3 l. 3 s. the Goods of Richard Hayward , in his Dwelling-house , Aug. 29 . Barbara Mason . Mr. Hayward keeps a Bagnio in Covent-Garden . The Gown was lost 5 Weeks ago , off the Back of a Chair in the back Parlour . The Doors of the House were open , and we imagine she watch 'd her Opportunity to slip in and take it . But it being advertised , Mr. Smitherman the Pawnbroker brought the Prisoner to our House , and she fell down on her Knees , and swore she never took the Gown away . My Mistress then took her into our back Parlour , and there she confessed before Catherine Griffiths , my Mistress and me , that she took it off the Chair in the back Parlour . Catherine Griffiths gave the same Account . Richard Smitherman . This is the Gown which the Prisoner brought me to pledge on the 28th of Aug. She asked 4 Guineas upon it , and said it was a Gentlewoman 's in the Neighbourhood , who knew me very well . I did not care to lend so much upon it , so she took it away ; but in 5 Minutes Time she brought it again , and said the Gentlewoman would take 3 Guineas , I told her I would lend but 2 Guineas upon it , which she took , and I sent my Boy after her to see where she went . The Boy watch 'd her into a House , and I was satisfied ; but the Gown being advertised 2 Days afterwards , I went to Mr. Hayward 's , told them I had the Gown , and they have it again . Then I set People to watch for the Prisoner , they sent me Word that she was at an Alehouse ; I went and took her from thence and carry 'd her to Mr. Hayward 's . I am positive she is the Person that brought me the Gown . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 15. John Phillipson , was indicted for stealing a pair of linnen Sheets , value 5 s. the Goods of Cornelius Gaughegan , in his Lodging , Oct. 5 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 16. Mary Ellis , was indicted for stealing a Silver Spoon , value 10 s. the Goods of Thomas Gilbert , Oct. 7 . Tho . Gilbert . About 6 Weeks ago I lost a Spoon , and my Maid informed me no one had been in the Kitchen but her Couzen , the Prisoner ; I sent after her , and she would own nothing ; but last Saturday was se'ennight , Justice Chamberlain sent to let me know he had got my Spoon , and I must prosecute the Prisoner . Richard Smitherman . About 10 Days ago the Prisoner and Mr. Gilbert 's Maid came and ask 'd for a Spoon , which the Prisoner had pledged to me on the 6th of Sept. last . I brought it down , and the Maid asked her Couzen ( the Prisoner ) how she could serve her so ; they made Words together and went away . I would have sent for Mr. Gilbert , but they did not care I should . In about a Week 's Time the Maid came again , and I delivered the Spoon to the Constable . The Prisoner brought it to me herself . Q Is it your Custom to take such Things in Pawn from People you are unacquainted with ? Smitherman I serve a great many People in a Day , and am not positive whether I took it in or not . I am as careful as I can be . Jury . Just now he said the Prisoner brought it to him herself ; now he says , he does not know whether he took it in or no . Smitherman . I found it in her Name in my Book , and she told me she brought it herself . Ermin Armstrong . I lost a Spoon of Mr. Gilbert 's on the 6th of last Month , and not only lost my Place about it , but paid 10 s. for it besides . I taxed the Prisoner with the Spoon , and she deny 'd it ; but afterwards she carry 'd me to the Pawnbroker 's Shop , and I saw it with T. G. M. ( my Master 's Mark ) upon it , but he would not let me have it without Money . About a Week afterwards I sent to my Master Gilbert , but because I had paid for the Spoon , he would not come to the Pawnbroker 's . Afterwards I found out the Prisoner , and charged a Constable with her , upon which she carry 'd me to Smitherman 's , and the Spoon he shewed me was the same that was lost . William Hemsley deposed , that the Prisoner confessed she stole the Spoon when she went to see the Maid ( her Couzen ) and told where 't was pawn 'd . John Daniel , Butcher at Hampstead , had known the Prisoner 6 Years , and had heard no Ill of her before . Acquitted . 17. Margery Stanton , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 5 s a Guinea and a Shilling , from the Person of Thomas Pierce , June 12 . Pierce . About 12 o'Clock at Night , on the 12th of June , I was going Home to my own House in Bond-street , in the Parish of St. George Hannover-Square , and the Prisoner pick 'd me up ; she came a-cross the Way to me , and took me to a Door , where she and I stood talking together about the Space of Time that I have been speaking here ; then she went into the House , and carry 'd away my Watch and Money with her . I had not got 5 Doors from the Place before I missed it . - But with Respect to the Thing , - here 's a Woman can give a much better Account of it than I can . Jury . Was the Door open where you talk 'd with the Prisoner ? Peirce . Yes , but I did not go in , I do n't suppose that both my Feet were over the Threshold ; and I am sure I was not with her above 3 Minutes , but while I stood there , she went in and fetch 'd me a Glass of Liquor , I refused to drink it , and she vow 'd , if I would not drink it she would pour it into my Bosom ; then she went in , and shut the Door . When I missed my Watch and Money , I went back and knock 'd at the Door , no Body would open it , but they told me , if I would come in the Morning I should have my Things again . Jury . Could she take your Watch and Money in 3 Minutes , and you not miss it ? Peirce . I had both Watch and Money in my Hand but 2 Minutes before she pick 'd me up ; and as soon as she went in I missed a Guinea , a Shilling , and my Watch too . Jury . Are you a marryed Man or a Batchelor Friend ? Peirce . A married Man . Juryman . Then you had no need to go abroad . Peirce . I went the next Day to the House , to enquire after my Watch and my Money , and the Minute the Prisoner saw me , she ran into another House , and so I lost her . 'T was a dark Night , but when she came out with the Glass of Liquor , she brought a Candle with her , so I saw her Face . She mov 'd her Lodging upon this very Account , else I should have taken her up before . About 3 Months afterward , I happen 'd to see her , so I took her up , and carry 'd her before a Magistrate ; and she told him she did not know me - she had never seen my Face before in her Life . 'T is true , I had been drinking , - but I was - sensible . Prisoner . Did not you take up another Woman for this Fact ? Peirce . After I took this Gentlewoman up , she got a Man to appear for her before the Justice , who told me I had taken up one or two Women before , tho ' I never charg 'd any other Woman with this Robbery . Prisoner . He swore before the Justice that he lost his Watch in the House , and the Woman that he had taken up before came and made an Affidavit , that she who robb 'd him made her Escape . Peirce . There was another Woman before the Justice , but I charged only the Prisoner . Martha Cassedy . I never saw the Prisoner in my Life , - I hope you 'll excuse me , - I never was here before , - I mean , I never saw her 'till I saw her here ; but I have seen the Prosecutor , and the Prisoner is not the Woman he brought into my House in Wardour street ; she was a lusty clever Woman , and brought the Prosecutor in , about 10 or 11 at Night , and call 'd for a Pint of Two-penny , - about 6 Months ago . Peirce . I am sure I never carry 'd but one Woman to her House . Cassedy . And that Woman was not the Prisoner . He drank Part of a Pint of Two-penny in the Tap-Room with the Woman he brought in , and then they both went out together . Mary Driskell . This Peirce met with me , about 2 or 3 Months ago , between 9 and 10 at Night , in Coventry-Court , in the Hay-market ; and he laid hold of me , and swore I was the Woman that had robb 'd him of his Watch . Another Man that was with him acted the Constable , and they dragg 'd me to Bond-street , and us 'd me very ill for 3 Hours ; but when I threaten 'd to send for my Husband , and People that knew me , they let me go . Peirce . I never saw this Creature in my Life , 'till I saw her before the Justice . Driskell . Yes ; I went before the Justice , and there he knew me perfectly well , and said , - why you are the Woman I took up before , - I have nothing to say to you . He had taken me up for stealing his Watch , and us 'd me ill , telling me for 3 Hours together , I was the Woman ; so when the Prisoner was carry 'd before the Justice , I went with her . Peirce . I beg she may be ask 'd what House I carry 'd her to in Bond street ? Driskell . I do n't know ; - but I believe I could find my Way to it . Hannah Dwyer I live in Belton street , St. Giles 's . The Prisoner came to live with me in the Beginning of June , and staid with me 'till Peirce came and took her out of my House . She never lay a Night all that Time , out of my House , but kept close , and work 'd very endeavouring , for her Bread , at Plain-work and Washing . As for her Character , I never heard nothing of her , but what was very extraordinary . She never went out at all , - never but about Business . Mary Jones . She liv 'd with me about 2 Years , in Ale's-Yard , and left me last April . I never saw any thing but what was just and honest in her , so I preferr 'd her to Mrs. Smith , and she preferr 'd her to Mrs. Dwyer . Dorothy Smith . She liv 'd between four and five Months with me , and went from me last April to Mrs. Dwyer ; I never hear 'd but she behav 'd her self well . Eliz Thompson . I have known her from a Baby ; she clears Headcloths , and uses her Needle . She made some Shirts for my Husband , and was going with me to buy Trimmings for them , when the Prosecutor came with a Butcher and a Constable , and said , I believe this was the Woman that took my Watch , for I remember she had the Sign of the Small Pox in her Face , so he carry 'd her before a Justice , and she was committed to Jail . Upon this I got a Lawyer to appear for her , ( an Acquaintance of mine ) and Peirce went to the Lawyer 's House in Compton-street , and told him he was a Party concern 'd , and so the Lawyer has got him to be try 'd for Scandal in the King's-Bench , The Lawyer 's Name is Luttwiche , - he practises the Law , - but whether he is a Lawyer or not , I can not tell . I have ask 'd the Prosecutor how he could charge a Woman who had liv 'd so well ? Why ( says he ) if you 're her Friend , give me a Silver Watch , or disburse 5 l. and I 'll acquit her , else I will swear down-right that she had it . Prosecutor to Cassedy . Have not you often told me in your own House , that the Prisoner 's Name was Margery Madge , and could tell me where she might be found ; and that you and she had had many Quarrels about my Watch Cassedy . No , never in my Life . Prosecutor . God forgive them all ! they 'd swear a Man 's Head off for a Farthing . Acquitted . 18. Mary Pocock , the Wife of ( Blank ) Pocock , was indicted for wilful and corrupt Perjury , in swearing that Thomas Pepper had sold her Spirituous Liquors , in a less Quantity than two Gallons . Mr. Wincup . On the 30th of May , the Prisoner , with one Edward Parker , an Excise Officer , came before my Lord Mayor with this Information . I do n't know whether he gave it me out of his Hand , but he said he had an Information . ( The Information was read . ) '' London . Be it remembered , that on the 30th `` of May , 1738 , Edward Parker , an Officer of `` his Majesty 's Revenue of Excise , came before `` me Sir John Barnard , Knt . Lord Mayor of this `` City , at Grocer's-Hall , and now here exhibiteth `` an Information , and informeth , that Thomas `` Pepper , of St. Butolph , without Aldersgate , `` on the 27th of May Instant , sold to Mary Pocock , `` Geneva , in less Quantity than two Gallons , `` and in a Room not entered at the Excise Office. `` And he , the said Informant , prayeth , that the `` said Thomas Pepper may be conven 'd before me , `` and shew Cause , why he should not be convicted `` of the said Offence ; and , that he , `` the said Informant , may receive ( if the said `` Pepper be convicted ) one Moiety of Ten `` Pounds '' Mr. Wincup . I know the Prisoner ; and when she and Parker brought the Information to my Lord Mayor , I asked her if she knew the Contents of the Paper ? She said , Yes ; and acknowledged the Name ( Mary Pocock ) to be her own Hand-writing . Then she laid her Right Hand upon the Testament , and I said , you shall swear that the Contents of your Deposition , are in all Parts , just and true ; and then she kiss 'd the Book in the Presence of my Lord Mayor . ( The Deposition was read . ) '' Mary Pocock , of Whitechapel , maketh Oath , `` That Thomas Pepper , on the 27th of May , in a `` Room in a House , situate in the Parish of St. `` Butolph , without Aldersgate , did sell unto this `` Deponent , a Quarter of a Pint of Geneva , for `` which she paid him 3 Half-pence . Mary Pocock . Thomas Pepper . I never saw the Prisoner at the Bar in my Life ( to my Knowledge ) 'till I saw her before my Lord Mayor , she then said , she had been a Customer to me a great while , and that I knew her , but would not know her . I keep a Chandler 's Shop , and she might perhaps come into the Shop , and take Notice enough of it to make her Story feasible . She swore that she came into the Shop , and bought a Half-penny Brick , and a Ha ' p'orth of Cheese , and a Quarter of a Pint of Geneva ; but if the dearest Friend in the World had come to me , and would have given me a Thousand Pounds , for a Quarter of a Pint of Spirituous Liquors , I had it not in my House of any Sort . On my Oath , I sold her no Spirituous Liquors at all , on the 27th of May , nor any one else . I wo n't pretend to swear , she might not have a Role and Cheese on that Day , for I keep a Public Shop , and it is impossible to remember every one 's Face that may come in . I sell no Liquors at all , but Small-Beer , nor have I sold any since the 1st of April . 'T is probable she might have Small-Beer with her Bread and Cheese , but I am sure I sold nothing but Small-Beer on that Day , nor on many Days before . Elizabeth Newland . I am a Nurse , and nurs 'd Mrs. Pepper of several Children ; she happened to be out of Town at this Time , and I was in the House from the 11th of May , to the 25th of June . I lay in the House , and eat in the House ; I took Care of the Children , and of the Shop in Mr. Pepper 's Absence . The 27th of May was Saturday , and I remember I was in the Shop from Six o'Clock at Night till Twelve . Mr. Pepper was there , but it was enough for two People to serve in the Shop on Saturday Night , so I was there to attend in the Shop , if I should have have been wanted ; for there was a great many People came , but not a great many together , or at a Time ; One or Two came in at a Time and went out , and then others came in . Q . Could you particularly take Notice of all that came to Mr. Pepper 's Shop that Night ? Newland . There are two Counters , but they are both on the same side of the Shop . I can say , I never saw that Woman in the Shop in my Life . Q . Did you take Notice of every one 's Face that came into the Shop from 6 o'Clock to 12 ? And can you say that Woman was not there in that Time ? Newland . She was not , as I saw ; and if she was , she could not be served with Geneva , for we had none in the House : From the 11th of May to the 25th of June , I never saw a Drop there , even for our own Drinking . During all the Time I was there , I saw nothing but Small-Beer and Strong ; I never saw any Wine , either sold or fetch 'd , to be drunk in the House ; I never ( during that Time ) heard any one come in to ask for Spirituous Liquors , for every body knew he did not sell any . Prisoner . You was not in the Shop that Night . I was there about Nine . Newland . I was in the Shop that Night from 6 to 12. John Ward . I lodge in Mr. Pepper 's House , and have done so five Years and better . I am a Watchman at Temple-Bar , and go out upon Duty between 10 and 11 every Night . I can not recollect this very Day , but I know , that from the Beginning of April , to this present Day , there were no Spirituous Liquors in the House . I eat , drink , and lye in the House ; my Wife and Family live there ; and I never saw any thing retail 'd ( of Liquor ) but Small-Beer ; no Ale nor Wine , but what was fetch 'd in ; may be now and then a Full-Pot of Ale or Beer ; as for Wine , I never-saw any fetch 'd . I have had Spirituous Liquors fetch 'd in sometimes for my own drinking , but it was always from another House , for none were sold by Mr. Pepper . I never serv 'd in the Shop , so can not say who might come there , or who did not . Samuel Wood . I am a Carpenter , and work 'd in Mr. Pepper 's House all the Month of April , and , I think , two or three Days in the Beginning of May . Being an Acquaintance , I breakfasted and dined with him ; and , as he was a Friend , I us 'd to come to Work every Morning at Six , and continue at it till Nine at Night . If in all that Time we had any Liquor better than Small-Beer , it was a Pot of Drink , sent for from the Alehouse . I never saw either Brandy , Geneva , or any Sort of Spirituous Liquors used in the House . I believe if he had any in the House , he would as soon have let me have had a little , as any one in England . I never heard any Body ask for Spirituous Liquors in the Shop , nor did I ask for any myself , because I have heard him profess he never would keep any in the House , not even for his own drinking , for fear he should be brought into a Scrape . John Pepper . I am the Prosecutor 's Father ; I have lived in his House above a Twelvemonth , and sometimes I eat with him . On the 27th of May last I was in the Shop about 5 at Night , and continued there till 10 , without going out at all . I sat there till I went to Bed , and I never saw this Woman come into the Shop . To my Knowledge he had not a Drop of Spirituous Liquors in the House , from the 1st of April last . He had not a Drop for ME , if I wanted it I was forced to go out and get it where I could . No Liquor was kept in the House , but Small Beer ; what Strong Drink we had at any Time , we fetch 'd from an Alehouse . Joseph Holmes . I serve Mr. Pepper with Bread , and carry it to his Shop twice every Day , often three or four Times a Day . Since the first of April I never saw any Liquor in his House but Small-Beer . I never had a Cogue from that Time to this , not one Drop . On the 27th of May I was there with Bread about Eight in the Evening , and staid there about a Quarter of an Hour ; then a Customer came in for a stale Half-Peck Loaf , and I went out to get a new one chang 'd , and came back again , and staid till three Quarters past Eight , and saw no Geneva , nor any Spirituous Liquors at all , from about a Fortnight before the 3d of May ; for Mr. Pepper was about that Time convicted in a Hundred Pound Penalty , though ( as he said ) he was innocent , and I endeavoured to get the Fine mitigated , and from that Time he never would have any in his House , to prevent his Trouble for the future . Jury . Please to ask him , who serv 'd in the Shop that Evening ? Holmes . Mr. Pepper himself ; Mrs. Newland was backward from the Shop in the Kitchen , as she commonly was . She was not in the Shop during the Time I was there . Newland . I was not out of the Shop a Quarter of an Hour all the Time . Holmes . I do n't remember that I saw any Body in the Shop that Night , but Mr. Pepper , and his Brother the Footman , and old Mr. Pepper . Defence . On the 27th of May , about 9 o'Clock , I went to Mr. Pepper 's Shop , as I usually did , and a young Man was with me . I call 'd for a Half-penny Brick , and a Ha ' p'orth of new Cheese . Mr. Pepper serv 'd me ; no body was in the Shop but he , then I call 'd for a Quartern of Gin ; he serv 'd me , and I paid him 3 Half-pence for it . The young Man ( Edward Hassel ) was with me at the same Time . There was a Candle in the Shop ; and on one Side of the Shop lies Coals , and Salt on the other . He brought the Bottle from behind the Counter , and went into a narrow Passage , between the Kitchen and the Parlour , and there he serv 'd me with his own Hands , and I made Oath of it , before the Commissioners , and before my Lord Mayor . The Surveyors then gave me a Character , and said they had never found me in an Error . Mr. Pepper came to the Tap-house in Newgate , and asked me , why I could not pass by his Door ? Why should I , says I ? Well , says he , I 'll put you into the Half-Moon , ( the Pillory ) and if I ca n't do your Business , I 'll get others that shall . 'T is a Liquor belov 'd by Vagrants and common People ; - I lost my Husband and Children by it . When I was before the Lord Mayor , with my Information , the young Man ( Hassel ) was with me , and swore he drank Part of the Liquor . Mr. Wincup . There was an Excise-Officer with her , but he did not speak to the Fact . I do n't remember that any one else was with her : No one but she was sworn . Guilty . [ Imprisonment .

Sept. 26 . Tho . Davis . I live in the Tower of London . On Monday the 25th of September I went to my Burean , in my Chamber , and open 'd it ( as usual ) to take a Guinea out of a Purse , which contain 'd 7 Guineas , and a mourning Ring , but it was gone ; somebody had taken it away . The next Day I miss 'd 9 Shirts , a dimitty Waistcoat , 3 Scarves , - 3 or 4 . Three Handkerchiefs , and ( I think ) a pair of Stockings . Mrs. Bennet having been robbed likewise , and the Prisoner having her Goods , it was suspected that he had got mine ; and Endeavours were used to bring him to Confession . At last this Corporal , ( John Alexander ) brought me 7 of my Shirts , the dimitty Waistcoat , and the Scarves . After these Things were deliver 'd to me , I went to the Prisoner , in the Black Hole , and desired to know where my Money was ? His Answer was , that he had given his Wife Orders to deliver all , and it she would come to him , he would endeavour to find the rest of my Goods . John Alexander . I went to the Prisoner after he was taken up , to ask him , if he knew any thing of Mr. Davis 's Things ? At first he said he did not : but at last he sent me to fetch his Wife to him . She came , and I went back with her to her Lodging , and she deliver 'd me all the Things mention 'd in Mr. Davis 's Indictment , by the Prisoner 's Order . He order 'd her in my Presence to let me go with her , and to deliver me the Things . These are what she deliver 'd to me . Mr. Davis . These are all mine . Hannah Bennet . I was robb 'd on the 26th of September of some small Linnen , ( mention 'd in the Indictment ) which hung upon the Lines in a Summer-house , upon the Ramparts of the Tower . A Window-shutter was taken off , and all my Things were gone . Robert White . I mounted Guard at the Tower on the 26th of September . The Prisoner came on Duty about One o'Clock , and went off without Leave about 3 in the Afternoon . Upon which I return 'd him to the Officer . About 11 at Night , the Robbery of Mrs. Bennet was found out ; and about that Time he came on Duty , and being suspected , I disarm 'd him and took him Prisoner , and found a great many Things that Mrs. Bennet swore to , in his Pockets . Then I took him before the Officers , and he own 'd that he clapp 'd one Foot against the Wall , and the other against the House , so got up , and wrench 'd open the Window with his Bayonet ; but he begg 'd the Officers would not bring him to Trial for the Fact . I can swear I deliver 'd Mrs. Bennet the same Things , I took out of his Pockets . Mrs. Bennet . And I swear they are all mine . Prisoner . I lay down to sleep on the Guard-Bed , and do n't know how the Things came into my Pocket . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 21.

Elizabeth Reynolds and John Fletcher , were indicted for assaulting Ann Blackwell on the King 's Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Guinea , Sept. 21 . Ann Blackwell . About 6 o'Clock at Night on the 21st of Sept . I went to Market to buy Meat for my Family , I carry 'd out 25 s. and bought 16 lb . of Beef for half a Crown , and a Cabbage , but that I did not pay for ; then I went to a House and had some strong Beer , for which I paid 3 d. and paying a Shilling I ow 'd , I got the Woman of the House to give me a Guinea for 21 Shillings which Guinea I ty 'd up in the Corner of the Handkerchief which was about my Neck , and thrust it between my Stays and my Gown , and then I had 6 d. left in Silver . As I was going Home thro ' Drury Lane about 3 or 4 Doors from Broad St. Giles 's , Fletcher knock 'd me down with his Hand , & ran away ; and Reynolds came up and asked me if I had hurt myself , and whether I had any Money about me , I told her I had but a Guinea , and that was in the Corner of my Handkerchief . I was not 3 Minutes talking to her before Fletcher returned up , and held both my Arms , while Reynolds tore a Hole in the Corner of my Handkerchief , and got out the Guinea Then I cry 'd out , - O my Guinea , my Guinea , she has robb 'd me ! Will no Body help me ! Fletcher ran away , and she try 'd to run away too , but I caught Hold of her , and cry 'd out again , O , my Guinea , my Guinea ! Upon this Fletcher return 'd and said , D - mn you what do you want ? - and knock 'd me down again with his Hand . Reynolds then ran away about the length of this Court , but a Man ran after her and took her immediately , and brought her back to me . She was no sooner came up to me , but she fell upon me , and under Pretence of searching me to see if I had not got the Guinea , she tore off my Cloths in such a Manner , that the Women were forc 'd to hold my Petticoats up about me , telling me , if I had 20 Guineas about me , she would have them all . At last a Constable was charged with Reynolds , and she said before the Justice , that she had not the Guinea . Fletcher was taken the Sunday following , and carry 'd before Justice Margets , where he confessed he had got it . James Milbourn . I am a Watchmaker , and live at Mr. Jackson 's a Cheesemonger in Drury-Lane , a little above Long-Acre . Long-Acre is almost half the Length of Drury Lane from Broad St. Giles 's . The Thing was done over-against my Lodgings . On the 20th of last Month , between 7 and 8 at Night , I heard some Body cry out , - O my Guinea , - my Guinea ! I look 'd out of my Window up two Pair of Stairs , and saw a Woman with a Candle and Lanthorn , by the Light of which I could see Reynolds , with her Arms about Blackwell 's Bosom , and a Man about Fletcher 's Size , had hold of her Arms . As soon as Blackwell cry 'd out , - Now she has got my Guinea , Reynolds made off , and the Man came up again and run Blackwell up against a Door , and asked her where she was going . But a Shoemaker happening to come by , took Reynolds and brought her back to Blackwell . Then I ran down Stairs , and found Reynolds very impudent , and a Constable carried her to Mr. Moulsey 's in Drury-lane , and there she called Mrs. Blackwell , a dirty Bitch ; and said , if I had Twenty Guineas , you should not have one of them . I search 'd her , and found nothing upon her , - but we carried her before Justice Margets , and there she was audacious again , and said she knew nothing of it . I saw her do the Thing by the Light of the Candle and Lanthorn , and am positive to her . Q . Did you know her before ? Milbourn . No . Q . How can you then swear to the Knowledge of her Face , when you say you saw her but by the Light of a Candle ( in a Lanthorn ) 2 Stories from the Ground ? Milbourn . I came down Stairs as soon as she was stopp 'd . Fletcher 's Examination and Confession before Mr. Justice Margets , was produced . The Justice 's Clerk . I saw Fletcher sign this ; and Justice Margets signed it likewise . It was read over to him before he signed it , and - I believe - he signed it voluntarily ; I wo n't say he had no Thoughts of being admitted an Evidence . I believe he was encouraged with a Probability of his being made an Evidence . The Confession was not read . Alice Orford . On Wednesday , Sept. 20 , I went to a Chandler 's Shop , facing Parker 's Lane , in Drury-Lane , and as I was coming out of the Shop with my Beer , I heard the Prosecutor , ( who was then two Doors off ) cry out , O my Guinea , - my Guinea ! I sat down my Drink , and went to see what the Matter was . I looked at the Prosecutrix , and thought she could not have a Guinea about her by her Appearance , but some Body brought Reynolds back to her , and she said , - that was the Woman who had taken her Guinea Then Reynolds said , - you Bitch , where should you have a Guinea , let me see if I can find this Guinea about you , and she put her Hands down the Prosecutrix 's Bosom and unty 'd her Petticoats , but could not find the Money . After this the Woman Prisoner ( Reynolds ) went up Meeting-House-Court , facing Parkers-Lane , and came back again directly to the Prosecutrix , - there was no Thorough-fare in that Court , and the Mob was sufficient to prevent her getting away , and so she came back again of her own Accord to the Place where I first saw her . Fletcher stood by the Corner of the Court , but I ca n't say whether he was concerned or not . Q . How far is Parkers-Lane from Long-Acre ? Orford . About the length of this Court , not a great Way . William Green , Constable . I took Fletcher and carry 'd him before Justice Margets , the Woman swore to him , and he said he could make a Confession . I ca n't say how it was obtained . Parkers-Lane is about 200 Yards from Broad St. Giles 's . Benjamin Worts shewed the Handkerchief out of which the Guinea was taken . Defence . Mary Shrub . I live at Mr. Pickerings the Brazier in Drury-Lane , on Wednesday was 3 Weeks , the Woman ( Blackwell ) was at my Landlord 's Door , facing Parker's-Lane , and cry 'd out , - she was robb 'd . I asked her what was the Matter ? She told me she was robb 'd of a Guinea , and desired me to hold the Candle ; I did so , and asked her if she knew the Person that robb 'd her ? yes , she said , perfectly well , then says I , was it such a one , or such a one ? ( holding the Candle to several People in the Croud ) Among the rest , I asked her if the Prisoner Reynolds was the Person ? No , she was not , 't was a Man she said , that knock 'd her down , and took her Money . On the Vertue of my Oath , she said so once or twice , and was so much in Liquor , that she had been dragg 'd thro ' the Kennel before I came . At last I asked her , - if I was the Person ? - I believe she was so much in Liquor , she was not able to say who it was . Elizabeth Waldron gave the Woman ( Reynolds ) the Character of an honest Woman . Susan Butler confirm 'd Mary Shrub 's Evidence , and added , that the Prisoner ( Reynolds ) when Shrub asked her who robb 'd her , came up her self and ask 'd her , if she had robb 'd her ? And the Prosecutrix said no ; she could not see the Person in the Croud , who had done it . She could not say whether Blackwell was drunk or sober . William Waldron gave Reynolds a good Character . Christian Davis . I saw the Prosecutrix that Night in Bloomsbury , all over Dirt , - and as ragged as I am now . 'T was pretty near the Fox Ale-house ; and the Butcher that she bought her Beef of , was going with her , into the Ale-house . He ask 'd her if she knew the Woman that had robb 'd her . She told him it was a Man , - a little , short , thick Man , in a checquer 'd Shirt ; and a Woman ( she said ) was with him , but she shou 'd not know her if she saw her . Fletcher . I had a checquer 'd Shirt on , and so they took me : I have no Witnesses here but my self . Both acquitted . 32.

I did not see the Prisoner take them , but I saw him go out with them , and I pursu 'd him , and took him with them under his Arm ; but when I laid hold of him , he dropp 'd them . He seem 'd to be surpriz 'd when I took him , and did not say any thing at all . When the Constable came , he was carry 'd before Mr. Justice Martyn , and there he did not directly own the Fact , but he said , he had liv 'd honestly ever since the last Time he was acquitted . Prisoner . When you took the Stockings under my Feet , were not other People about the Place ? Mr. Backhouse , I believe there was none but the People who might then happen to be going by ; when I first laid hold of the Prisoner , he had them under his Arm . Agnes Backhouse . I was in the Shop , and saw a Man take the Stockings out of the Window , but I do n't care to swear to the Prisoner , upon the little Sight I had of him ; but when I saw him take them , I called to my Husband , and he pursued him and took him , and brought him back with 9 pair of Stockings .
