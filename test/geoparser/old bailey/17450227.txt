James Currey . About a year ago the Prisoner came to my house in order to have a lodging as she used to do now and then : my wife and I had some words , and she went out ; I shut the door against her , and kept her out . My wife was afraid I should take the money , and she hid it behind the bed - as she told me : the Prisoner went to make the bed , when she had done she went away , and has not been seen for a year and a quarter till the other day - I saw her take the money from under the bed 's head . Catharine Currey . The Prisoner came to my house for a lodging that night , and several other nights - That night was about five weeks before last Christmas was twelvemonth . My husband wanted to go out , and I was not willing he should , and he being angry , for fear he should take the money which I had in my pocket , I put it behind the bed between the wall and the bed 's head - There were fifty four shillings in silver . Q . What did you go out for ? Currey . For a minute or two , in order to pacify my husband ; and he said , if I went out , I should stay till I was cold : the Prisoner came out in two or three minutes after , and says to me , do not go in till I come back again ; she then had her hand under her apron ; said I , where are you going ? she said she was going for water , which was about eight or nine yards off , but she did not come back : when I went in I looked for my money , and it was gone . I told my husband of it , and asked him who had been there ; he said nobody but Mrs. McCardell ( for the Prisoner went by that name then ) - When she was before the Justice she denied she took it , but about two days afterwards in New Prison she owned she saw me put it behind the bed , and that she took it away . Thomas Bruden . I was that night at James Curgreys 's house , and staid supper ; the Prisoner was there , and they said they had lost some money that night : Currey heard something of the Prisoner , and desired I would look out for her . I went several times , and could not find her , but at last I met with her in White Cross Street , by Old Street Church , with a pewter standish under her arm , and she had upon her a gold ring belonging to my wife . I asked her concerning Mr. Currey 's money , and she said she did not know any thing of the matter . I said you had better own it , for I will not part with you . She was carried before a Justice , and there she owned that her husband ( Arthur McCardel ) ordered her to go into Currey 's house to take the money ; and that she took the money , gave it to him , and he gave her six-pence , and that was all she had of it . Martha Bruden . The Prisoner said she took the money ; I asked her how she came to take it ; she said , she saw her landlady tell the money into the purse , and saw where she put it , and so was induced to take it . Guilty 39 s . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 162 . + Sarah Wells , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing one moidore and three guineas , the property of John Puckett , privately from his person , January 28 . John Puckett . On the 28th of January between the hours of nine and ten , the Prisoner picked me up at the corner of Crown Court Soho , and asked me for something to drink : she kept a long side of me , and entreated me to go to her lodging in Peter 's Street , and I was foolish enough to go with her : we went into the house ( which she called her lodging ) into a room up one pair of stairs . I called for a quartern of shrub , and paid for it : she asked me to lie with her , which I was weak enough to consent to . I asked her what she must have ; she told me a shilling ; I gave her the shilling ; I had three guineas and a moidore in my pocket before I lay with her ; after she got off the bed , she went out of the room under pretence of calling the maid of the house to bring a chamber-pot ; I immediately missing my money , went after her , and told her she should not go out of the house , for I had lost so much money . Q . Was she gone out of the room before you missed your money ? Puckett . Yes ; without the door ; she came back into the room , and said I might search her clothes . I searched her ; she pulled off her clothes , and I could find no money about her . I told her , if she knew any thing of the money , and would let me have it again , I would not trouble her any further ; but she still denied it , and I charged the watch with her . Prisoner . Pray , Sir , was I out of the room ? Puckett . Yes ; you was out of the room . Prisoner . I was not out of the room . Puckett . You was out of the room-door as far as the top of the stairs . Prisoner . You searched me , and I pulled all my clothes off : the landlady was present at the same time : I took off my shoes and stockings too . Puckett . That is a story , you pulled your shoes off , and you would have pulled your stockings off , but I said it did not signify any thing . Q . Had you been drinking ? Puckett . No ; nothing at all . Q . Can you swear that this money might not seatter out of your pocket while you was upon the bed ? Puckett . I took the clothes off the bed , and searched , and there was no money upon the bed - after I had searched her . Acquitted . 163 . + Elizabeth Brown , of St. Dunstan 's Stepney , was indicted for stealing six plain gold rings , value 30 s. an enamelled ring , value 6 s. one 36 s. piece of gold , one moidore , and twenty three guineas , the property of Andrew Barber , in his dwelling-house , January 25 . Andrew Barber . The Prisoner was my servant , and absconded from my house the 25th of January last ; I wondered she did not return , but I had then no suspicion of being robbed . I went the 26th at night to a press to change a guinea , and missed the rings and the money which I saw the morning she absconded her service : the press did lock , but I found it open . Q . Was it locked on the twenty fifth ? Barber . I know nothing to the contrary - I believe I locked it - I can not swear I did . Q . What was found upon her ? Barber . There were 6 l. 4 s. in gold and silver , and two plain gold rings found upon her at Westram in Kent . Q . Were the two gold rings yours ? Barber . Yes . Ann Wise . The Prisoner came to my mother 's house on a Friday night , and said she had got some money , and was to go to Westram in Kent , and desired to lay there all night : my mother let her lie there , she said she was to go out in the morning at four o'clock . The next morning my father and I went with her to the inn , for she said she was to go down in the coach . When we came to the Borough , she said it was too late for the coach , and was afraid she must walk it : when we came to the turnpike we went into an alehouse , had a pot of beer , and two peny worth of bread and cheese ; there was a coach going by the door , and she desired me to ask the coachman where he was going ; he said to Croydon ; she agreed to go with him : when we came to the coach door , she desired I would go with her ; I went with her : when she came there , she desired the coachman to enquire for somebody , but there was no such person to be found : we went to the Cross Keys and had tea for breakfast , and some beef-stakes for dinner ; then she went to a shop keeper in the town , and bought several things , a gown , a petticoat , and some handkerchiefs ; then we went to the Cross Keys again , and she told me there was no carriage to Westram till Monday , so I staid with her Sunday and part of Monday , then she paid for my coach hire , and sent me up to London . Q . Did you know the Prisoner before ? Wise . No otherwise than as she used to come to our house for pots . - Barber . I keep a publick house . Philip Horsefield . We were informed by Ann Wise where the Prisoner was gone , and about one o'clock on Tuesday morning , January 29 , Mr. Roberts , Mr. Barber , and I set out after her from Mr. Barber 's , and found her at the George Inn at Westram standing in the drinking-room ; I called her on one side , went into another room , and said , how could you use your master and mistress so as to rob them ? with that she laid down these two gold rings before us , then she went out and told me she had not made any use of her master 's money , but had left the money and rings at the Bell at Westram : Mr. Roberts and she went out together , and she made her escape from him . Q . How do you know that ? Horsefield . Because I took her again in another house at Westram , and brought her back to the Bell , and she said the woman at the Bell had the money and rings , but I do not believe the woman knew any thing of them : said Mr. Roberts , did not you take a note or any thing of the woman ? no , says she , I did not , for I knew the woman very well . Q . What did the woman of the house say ? Horsefield . She said she never saw a farthing of the money , and that the Prisoner spent but three pence in the house . Q . Do you know whether these are Mr. Barber 's rings ? Horsefield . I believe this is Mr. Barbers wife 's wedding ring ; Mr. Roberts could read writing , but I can not . Barber . These are my rings , Guilty 4 s. 10 d . Mr. Roberts not appearing to give evidence , the Court ordered his recognizance to be estreated . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 164. Jane Linsley , was indicted for stealing a duffle coat , value 6 s. the goods of Going Drayton , February 18 . Diana Drayton . On Monday the 18th of February I went over the way to a neighbour 's , and she desired me to stay with her a little ; I told her I had left my door open . I went over again , and saw the Prisoner in my room with my husband 's coat in her hand ; she had taken it off a nail , but had not time to put it cross her arm . Seeing a strang person there , I was frightened , and asked her what she did there ; she said , that either Mr. Williams or Mrs. Williams had sent her for the coat ; I said the coat was mine , and she should not have it ; she said it was hers , and she would have it ; I told her I would take it away ; then she took hold of me by the handkerchief which was about my neck , and shook me . I called to a woman who was in the house , and she said she would have me send for an officer ; I said I was but a stranger in the place , and did not know where to get one : I said the Prisoner was an impudent jade , and I would get an officer for her ; she said , if I did not get an officer for her , she would get one for me , so I staid and kept the Prisoner , and Mrs. Treddell went for an officer . Q . What did the Prisoner do with the coat ? Drayton . She laid the coat down , and said , D - n you , there is the coat , I have not robbed you of any thing , Treddell . Mrs. Drayton called me down stairs , when I came down , the Prisoner had the coat in her hand , she laid the coat down upon the dresser , and said , D - n you , I have not robbed you of nothing ; D - n you , you are a saucy jade to stop me without a constable , I will have one for you : I said she should have one in a little time , and that I believed it was not the first time she had deserved one , so I got a constable , and she was taken up . Prisoner . I had received some money of my mistress , and went to buy a gown , and the gown was too strait for me , and I went in there to enquire for one Mrs. Williams , a mantua maker , and a woman shoved by me ( I do not know whether that gentlewoman [ Mrs. Drayton ] is the person ) and said , What do you do here , how came that coat there ? Drayton . I did not say how came the coat there . Prisoner . Had not I a new gown on ? Drayton . You had a newish gown on . Prisoner . The gentlewoman insisted upon my company , kept me three quarters of an hour , and then charged a constable with me . Guilty 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 165 . + James How , was indicted for stealing a perriwig , value 20 s. the property of John Fitzar , in the shop of Elizabeth Grant , January 17 . Thomas Smith . I was servant to Mrs. Grant ; the Prisoner James How came into her shop at Hoxton to be shaved ; when he came in , the wig was hanging upon a peg ; I went for some warm water , and shaved him ; in about a quarter of an hour after he was gone I missed the wig , and called to my mistress to know whether she had delivered it to any body , and she said she had not . I went to seek after him , and found him behind Old Street Church wheeling of bricks : I charged him with stealing the wig , went with him to a publick house , and he delivered me the wig out of his pocket . I had some knowledge of him , he had been shaved there at different times . Prisoner . I went into the shop to be shaved , I did not take the wig out of the shop with a design to cheat him of it , but out of a joke ; and when he came to me , I delivered it to him again directly . Smith went to my wife , and agreed to take a guinea of her not to appear against me , and offered to let me go . I have a note [ receipt ] here to prove it . The following paper was produced and read . ' February 25 , 1744 . Received of James How ' two shillings and six-pence , in part of one pound ' one shilling . Received by me , ' THOMAS SMITH . ' Q . Do you know any thing of th is ? Whose writing is it ? Smith . This is one Brown 's writing , a gardner at Hoxton . Mr. Brown wanted me to make it up , and gave me half a crown , and I told him no such thing could be done - I have seen this paper before . Prisoner . Mr. Smith said he would make it up . Smith . I said if I could do the Prisoner any service , I would ; but afterwards , when I had informed myself , I went to his wife , and told her I could not do it : I would have served him if I could , because he had a wife and two or three children . Guilty 4 s. 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 166. John Farrow , was indicted for stealing eleven pound weight of sugar , value 2 s. the goods of persons unknown , February 1 . David Day . I saw the Prisoner come out of a warehouse at Wiggins 's Key with something in his pocket ; I asked him what he had got there ; said he , D - n you , what is that to you : his pocket hit against my leg , and that made me suspect him , so I searched him , and found eleven pound of sugar in his pockets and the lining of his coat . I went up into the warehouse , and there was the head of a hogshead open , and it seemed to be the same sugar of that hogshead . I take it to be the property of Mr. Eliakim Palmer . I would have drubbed him with a hoop stick , and have sent him about his business ; but he threatened us if we meddled with him , for he said the sugar was given him at Smart 's Key . Thomas Hewlett . The Prisoner was brought to me by Mr. Day , and the sugar was taken from him . I know very little of his character ; he has worked for me now and then . Guilty 10 d .

William Ratcliff . The Prisoner came one day to my house , and asked me , if I was not a fan-stick maker , and knew one John Henley ; I said , yes : then he poured some oil out of a large tin pot into a bottle , and left the pot and the rest of the oil with me : I believed it to be stole . I went to Mr. Moore 's by Cripplegate , and asked him if it was his ; he said it was not his pot - Mr. Moore sent his man for it , and I delivered it to him . I verily believe this to be the pot that the Prisoner brought to me , but I can not swear it . James Moore . Mr. Ratcliff came to my house , and said , he had an oil pot left at his house , which he believed was stole . I sent my man for it , but it was not mine . I sent to Mr. Harrison to acquaint him that I had such a thing ; he said it was his , and lost such a day . Nicholas Aris . This is the pot I fetched from Mr. Ratcliff 's house .

In the night between the 6th and 7th of October , my house was broke open - I was called up about seven in the morning , and the goods and money , mentioned in the indictment , were taken away . Q . Did you perceive there had been any marks of violence on any part of the house ? White . There was a hole cut in the window-shutter of the kitchen , and it was unbarred on the inside . Here is the handle of an instrument which the coopers use in boring , which was found on the outside of the kitchen window . They had let themselves out at the street-door , and taken the key with them ; so that we could not get into the street without taking off the lock of the door . We found the key in our own area , and a boy found the drawer , which the money was in , in a neighbour 's area . Jane White . In the morning , about 7 o'clock , I was informed the house was broke open , and that we were robbed of every thing they could come at , which was worth taking away . Prisoner . I desire they may be examined separately . Mrs. White . I know what I have to say . Prisoner . Mr. White ought not to be there . Jane White . The bureau was broke open : there was a glass case upon the bureau , and in this glass case there was a drawer with money in it , which they took away . I believe there were between five and six pounds . There was in that drawer a small buckle and some pieces of silver . I lost a great deal of linen , but have not heard of any of it since . - I was sure the house was fast when I went to bed , for I always look to it . - I was not the last person up . - There was a hole cut in the kitchen window shutter , through which they put a hand in , turned a screw , and the bar fell down upon some pewter , and that , it seems , made a noise . I did not hear it . Jane Young . I am servant to Mr. White . The kitchen window was fast when I went to bed , which was about two minutes after my master and mistress went up . I was the last person below stairs . I got up about seven o'clock in the morning , and when I came down into the kitchen , I saw the casement open , and a hole cut in the window shutter , and the bar was down . It was an iron bar , which screwed in the middle : it was unscrewed ; half of it was up and half down , and several things were pulled about the kitchen . - I did not hear any noise in the night . The shop was stripped , and the tea taken away . There were about ten canisters with tea taken out of the shop . - The canisters were found in a gardener 's ground near Aylosse-street . - The shop is in Little Aylosse-street , Goodmans-fields . Samuel Mecum . This James Stansbury , Abraham Saunshus , Daniel Boyers , and I , broke open this Shop . One of the Jews told me , about three days before , there was a great deal of tea in it ( Saunshus and Boyers are both Jews . ) We went there about twelve o'clock at night , and there was a light above stairs ; so we went to an ale-house just over against the house , till it was a proper time , and had four or five full pots of beer and some bread and cheese , and staid there till about one . Q . Did you know the house ? Mecum . I never was in the house before . I saw this young woman in the house then [ Mrs. Spring 's daughter . ] After we had committed the robbery , we went to Stansbury 's house : I lodged there at that time . Q . Where was Stansbury 's house ? Mecum . I kept a house in Whitechapel , and he lodged with me there . This tool was broke in breaking into the house [ the cooper 's tool , mentioned before . ] Q . Who broke the house open ? Mecum . Stansbury did it , for none of us could do it so well as he could . We got down into the area : Stansbury took a pane of glass our , and then fell a boring some holes in the shutter with the iron that belonged to this instrument ; then he put his hand in , and the bar fell down upon some pewter . The pewter fell down and made a vast great noise : we stood two or three minutes , to hear if any body came down , but we could not hear any body . Stansbury used to take snuff , and in his snuff-box he had some tinder ; we had a flint and a steel , and so struck a light , and then put a bit of candle into a dark lanthorn . Q . Where had you the candle ? Mecum . We never were without it when we went to do such things , we always carried it in our pockets . Then Stansbury and I accordingly got in , and let the other two in at the street door . There was a great latch and a screw over the latch . of the door , which we unscreweed ; the key was in the street door . Then we went directly to the tea canisters , took about six or seven of them off the shelves , and put them on the counter . Then we saw a thing like a scrutore ( there was an ink bottle in it , and that we threw down . ) We took out a drawer , and there was a little white canvas bag with some gold and silver in it ; afterwards we went to the till , and took about seven or eight shillings out of it , chiefly in half-pence : there were some drawers underneath the scrutore , which we broke open , and there were ruffled shirts , handkerchiefs , aprons , and several other things of wearing apparel - I believe there might be eight or nine shirts ( we sold them in a hurry for fear of having the house searched : ) then we took to the best of my knowledge six canisters of tea , and two bundles of linen ( there were two pair of bran new pumps ) which we carried home : when we carried them home we locked the street door , and took the key away with us ; we came back again , and then we took away about four canisters of tea . There was some silver which was not brought to light ; I know nothing of that ; and they broke something , I believe it was a pair of tea tongs : then we locked the street door , and somebody threw the key down the area , and said , D - n them , let them find the key . Q . Where did you carry these things ? Mecum . To my house in White Chapel ; Boyers , ( for he used to buy stolen goods as well as go a thieving ) gave us 3 l. for the clothes - what silver there was he had with the clothes for that money - we moved the tea to Boyer 's house in Houndsditch , and he moved it to an empty room that he had in Houndsditch : we emptied the tea before we moved it , and put it into different parcels , because we would not mix it , and threw the canisters into a garden near a dunghill as you go from London to Stepney . Prisoner . I desire the witnesses who have given their evidence may be put out of Court , because I have some questions to ask him about some pieces of coin . [ At the Prisoner 's desire the witnesses were ordered to withdraw . ] Prisoner . He was pleased to say there was gold in the bag . I desire to know what coin it was ? Mecum . To the best of my knowledge there were two guineas , half a guinea , half a moidore , and the rest was in silver . I had a guinea , and nine pence in half pence for my share of the money . I had not done these things if you had not persuaded me to it . When your wife was under sentence of transportation , you came to my house to get money this way in order to save her - He lay there upon the account of going out with me . Prisoner . I desire to know whether he has any body to prove this , for he will say any thing to save himself , as this sort of people do . Have not you been tried for theft in this Court before ? Mecum .

Isaac Lane . On a Saturday morning the eighth of December last , between seven and eight o'clock , pretty near Bow Church on the Essex road , a little on this side of Bow , Samuel Poulton the Prisoner at the bar rode up on the right hand side of me . Court . Look on the Prisoner , are you sure he is the man ? Lane . I know him very well , my Lord ; he rode up to me on the right hand side , offered a pistol to me , and demanded my money , or I was a dead man ; and that I might be certain what he did say , I asked him , and said , What did you say ; he repeated the same words again , and said , Deliver your money , or you are a dead man , or words to the same purpose : I do not justly know , whether he said he would blow my brains out , for I was a little surprised : then I rode from him down the town , and called out a highwayman . Q . Did he meet you or overtake you ? Lane . He overtook me . As I was telling my story to some journeymen carpenters on this side of Bow Bridge , and describing the horse , I saw a man come riding down the town ; he walked his horse , and was whistling : I imagined it to be him , and it was him . He came up ; I let him go a few yards past me , and then challenged him , and said , You are the villain that just now offered to rob me by the church : he made answer , I am just come from the Bell in Warwick Lane ; I said , Come from where you will , I am sure you are the man ; he said , that can not be , for you were describing him to be upon a black horse , and I am upon a bay horse , ( but it was a dark chesnut horse , I thought it had been a black horse . ) I was describing the horse to the men , and he overheard me ; this was not above five minutes after his first attacking me . I said , I am very positive you are the man ; he said , will you swear that ; I said , yes , I will ; with that he set spurs to his horse and rode very hard down towards Essex ; I rode after him , and pursued him , and he got into the marshes , then some other people rode after him , and took him . Prisoner . Are you sure it was a chesnut horse ? Lane . I believe it was , but I am very sure you are the man . Francis Titham . I live by Bow Bridge in the Parish of Westham : on the 8th of December between seven and eight in the morning , Mr. Isaac Lane came riding up to my door , and asked me , if I saw a highwayman ; I said , I did not see any : says Mr. Lane , then he is turned down some of these ways . I looked down , but could not see any body : as I was going into the marshes , I was told there was a man rode into the marshes : there is on osier ground , and I saw a place where a horse had leaped over . I tracked the prints of a horse 's feet about 20 yards into the osier-ground , and suspected that the highwayman was there . I called more people to my assistance , and we went up all on a-breast and took him in the osier ground ; another person laid hold of him first , but before he was laid hold of he opened his great coat , and said , he had no fire arms : we searched him , but could not find any about him . Philip Waylep . I saw the Prisoner Samuel Poulton stop the gentleman upon the road : I have known Poulton five or six years . Q . What day of the month was it ? Waylep . It was the 8th day of December - on a Saturday morning , Q . What was you doing of ? Waylep . I was driving a stage waggon just by . Q . Was you near enough to hear what he said ? Waylep .

See summary . ] 177 . + John Reese , of St. Mary Lestrand , was indicted for the murder of Andrew Smith , by giving him a mortal wound with a certain piece of wood called a cooler oar , upon the hinder part of the head , near the left ear , of the length of one inch and a quarter , and the breadth of half an inch , January 22 . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for manslaughter . Henry Elers . The deceased was a servant of mine , and so is the Prisoner . About six weeks ago in the morning I was in the boiling-house ( I am a sugar refiner , I live in the Savoy ) I was with them two hours , from eight to ten , and did not hear of any dispute between them : when I came home between two and three o'clock , I heard of this misfortune that had happened . The deceased was a pan-man , a superior workman , and had double the wages of the Prisoner . I heard that this happened about twelve or one o'clock , when nobody was there but themselves . I went up to the deceased and spoke to him as he lay upon the bed , but he was not able to give me any answer with relation to what had happened . Q . What was the deceased in his behaviour ? Elers . He was always addicted to quarrelling , but as to the Prisoner , during the time he lived with me , he always behaved civilly , and was not given to quarrel . Daniel Deickman ( surgeon . ) On the 22d of January I was called between two and three in the afternoon to visit a patient who was very much hurt , and they believed the man was dying . I made haste , and found the patient in a dangerous condition ; the blood ran out at his left ear , and out at his mouth too : upon the left side of his head behind the ear there was a contusion wound , of an inch and a quarter in length , and half an inch in breadth . I asked the deceased how he came by this misfortune , but he would give me no answer . Q . Was he in a condition to speak ? Deickman . It will come by and by . I asked the people of the house how he came by that wound ; they said he was fighting with the Prisoner at the bar . I asked the Prisoner if he had not given him this dangerous blow , and told him , I was afraid the man would die : the Prisoner answered me , he was very sorry for it if he should die , but he could not help it , for the deceased struck him twice before he struck him again . I asked the deceased , whether it was true what the Prisoner said ; the deceased would not answer me the question , but doubled his fist , and said , Hounsfoot , ( that is a word of resentment ) and I believe if he had had strength he would still have sought with him ; so the Prisoner himself said , Did not you strike me twice before I struck you ? he would not answer that question neither , but repeated Hounsfoot . When he was in bed he vomited a vast quantity of blood ; the convulsions seized him so strong , that three or four men could not hold him . I told Mr. Elers how it was , and desired he would send for another surgeon ; so Mr. Pye was called , but he only assisted me ; so we consulted , and I scalped his head in order to have trepanned him the next day , but he died that night . The same as if he had called him dog in English . The deceased was a Swede . Q . Do you think by the manner in which he pronounced the word Hounsfoot twice , that he could have spoke more if he had pleased ? Deickman . Yes ; I believe he could ; for he asked afterwards , whether his master was come home . Q . Do you apprehend the contusion was occasioned by a blow or by a fall ? Deickman . I believe it was by a blow , for he vomited so much blood , that I believe the internal sinus was broke . Q . Do you think the blow was given by a fist or by an instrument ? Deickman . I believe it was given by an instrument : the Prisoner had a hurt upon his hand , - it was done by an instrument to be sure . Elers . There were two wooden oars broke - they are things that we stir the sugars with . Acquitted of the murder , and acquitted on the Coroner 's Inquisition . The Jury found that the deceased died a natural death by the visitation of God . 178 . + William Joyce , of London , was indicted for stealing a bay gelding , value 15 l. the property of John Thompson , Esq ; Feb. 1 . John Thompson . I have a field joining to Great Marlow Bridge , in the parish of Bisham and county of Bucks . I lost a brown bay gelding with a bald face fourteen hands three inches high ; it was in the field on the 18th of January , and on the 19th it was gone : the gelding was stopped at the King 's Head in Smithfield . I sent my servant into the market to the person I bought him of , to ask him if he should know him ; and in about half an hour he was brought to the toll book to be tolled - I was directed by an advertisement of Mr. Perry 's in a news-paper , to go to the King 's Head in Smithfield , and there I saw my gelding . William Hrare . I am servant to Mr. Thompson ; I was in town with my master when the horse was lost ; he had an account sent him of it , and the next Friday but one I went to Smithfield to see if I could hear any thing of him . The first man I saw was Mr. Perry , the person my master bought him of . I asked him if he remembered such a horse he sold to a gentleman in May last , and described it : he said he remembered the horse very well : then I told him the horse was lost out of a field belonging to my master , and desired if he should see any thing of him to detect the person , or stop the horse ; he told me he would , and I heard nothing further till the horse was advertised . My master and I went the next day to the King 's Head in Smithfield , and saw the horse . Collins Perry . The first of this instant February Mr. Thompson 's servant came to me in Smithfield , and asked if I remembered such a horse that I sold his master in May last ; I said very well ; he said the horse was lost , and desired I would endeavour to find him out . About half an hour afterwards just by Long Lane in Smithfield the horse crossed me ; what Mr. Thompson 's man had said came fresh into my mind , and I took hold of the bridle ; I said , friend , where are you a going ? he said he was going home - his name is Thomas Dunn . I said I believe this horse is stole , you must go to the toll book . He said he would . I went to the toll book , and there were the names of the seller and the voucher entered . Presently after , Mr. Dunn met the seller of the horse ( the Prisoner at the bar . ) Mr. Dunn had paid him part of the money , but would not pay the whole till he had him tolled . There was a voucher brought , and the voucher said they gave him a shilling to vouch for the horse , and pulled the shilling out of his pocket , but he said he did not know any thing of the horse , so we secured the Prisoner , but the voucher run away . I had forgot Mr. Thompson 's name , and did not know where to find him without sending down to great Marlow , so I published an advertisement the next morning , and Mr. Thompson came and claimed the horse . [ Mr. Dunn was called , and Mr. Perry said he was in Court yesterday , but had the misfortune to fall down and break his arm ] Q . When the Prisoner was charged with the horse , did he say , he had sold it to Dunn , or did he not ? Perry . Dunn wanted the money again that he had paid the Prisoner for the horse , and the Prisoner said , I ca n't give it you now , but , upon my soul , you shall have it . Prisoner . Where did you see me ? Perry . About fifty yards off the toll-book , you and the voucher together . Q . Did the Prisoner , after you had been at the toll-book , endeavour to make his escape ? Perry . There were twenty of my acquaintance round us , that he could not get away , if he would . The person I left in charge with him at the King 's head , while I went for a constable , said he would have got out at the window . Richard Wright ( constable ) took charge of the Prisoner , and carried him before a magistrate , who committed him . Francis Clarke . I live at Grays in Essex . I have kept a farm there some years . The Prisoner lived with me three or four years . Q . How long is that ago ? Clarke . About two years . He was the best servant I ever had in my life ; and I wish I had such another now . I had him from a gentleman who lives near me , and had a very good character of him . I heard that gentleman say lately , he was a very good servant . - I am far from thinking that he would be guilty of the fact he is charged with . Guilty Death . 179 . + William Bailey , of St. George , Hanover-square , was indicted ( with Roger Allen and Robert Scott , not yet taken ) for stealing two pair of worsted stockings , value 6 s. and a linen waistcoat , value 4 s. the property of Abraham Dirknell , in the stable of the most noble Charles Duke of Bolton , July 20 . 1742 . William Dirknel . About two years ago last June , I left a box in the Duke of Bolton 's stables , with the stockings and waistcoat in it , and they were lost . I do n't know any thing of the Prisoner 's taking them . Henry Sims * . [ * Henry Sims was tried last sessions for robbing William Margerum of a gold watch , & c. See that remarkable trial , Sessions paper p. 58. trial 140 . ] About three years ago , or better , I lived as a servant with my Lord Duke . When I came away from my Lord Duke 's , I got into a gang of people , misfortunate as such people are . Roger Allen , Robert Scott , William Bailey , and I agreed to go a robbing together . We went out two or three nights , and got nothing . Says this William Bailey , You lived a servant with the Duke of Bolton , you may get something out of my Lord Duke 's . Said I , I do n't know but I may . Between ten and eleven at night , we went there with an intent to rob the house , not the stable . We all put our hands to the bottom of the stable door , and broke the bar , so as to get in , and got into a room where a helper or postilion lay , and took two pair of stockings and a work 'd linen waistcoat . We intended to break open the house , but there was a servant in the laundry . We went into the stable , got a pitch-fork , and endeavoured to break open the door where the coachman lay , but did not . Says I , Let us go about our business , with what we have got . Said the Prisoner at the bar , Do n't let us go . D - n my eyes , we will tie the people in the house , before we will do that . Said I , Do n't do that , because I shall be known ; and I shall be taken one time or other . Accordingly we came about our business : the bar not being quite broke through , we brought it together , as a red hot poker would come , and shut the door after us . Then we came to the Prisoner 's lodging , and agreed how to dispose of what we had . We sold the waistcoat for half a crown to an old clothes man ( I think ) in Thrift-street , Soho , and spent the money ; and the stockings we tossed up for , under an arch in Peter 's street , where the Prisoner lived , and I won them . Q . Have you any witness to prove that the Prisoner and you were together ? Sims . We were brought up together : I have no witness to prove that we were together there . It is about two years and an half since this was done . Charles Conner . Henry Sims and I were in New Prison , and lay in the same bed . He was committed for an assault . He said he could put twenty people into his information , if it would save him , and if he could get off from being a soldier : and said , he would put twenty people into his information before the woman should be imprisoned who had ruined herself upon his account . And he asked Joseph Uptebake , whether putting twenty people in his information would not save the woman from ruin , who was in prison for debt , and had ruined herself upon his account . Sims .

I know what people have said , but I am not to condemn him myself . - It is about two years and an half since he came from Portsmouth and then he came with a stab in his side - He lodged in Oxford Road . I believe , in about a a week or a fortnight after he came to town , he fell ill of an ague and fever ; and was ill , I believe , five or six months . Q . Was he consined and uncapable of working ? Raven . He was not able to go to work . He was as people in that distemper are . Q . Was he so all the six months ? Raven . I ca n't say I saw him all the six months . I saw him in May and June . Acquitted . 180 . + Henry Cutler , of London , labourer , was indicted for stealing a piece of Portugal gold coin , value 18 s. and 19 guineas in money , two yards of sattin , value 3 s. and thirty pound weight of indigo , value 6 l. the property of Miles Dalton , in his dwelling-house , Nov. 13 . Miles Dalton . On the 30th of October last I put 5 guineas and an 18 s. piece to some other money ( about fifteen or sixteen guineas ) in my bureau . I live in Little Bell-alley in Coleman-street , in a large garden , where there are two tenements . Henry Cutler lived with me at that time as a servant : he came to me about a month before : he lay in the kitchen just by the parlour where the money and goods were . I had no servant in the house but himself . When I came down in the morning about seven o'clock , I opened the parlour door , and the first thing that presented itself to me was the parlour window broke open and entirely taken away , and the bar was cut at the bottom . I was vastly surprized , turned to the bureau , saw that broke open , and all my papers ransacked and turned reply turvy . My man was then in the kitchen putting up his bed . I called out to him , Harry , I am robbed and ruined . Is it possible you can lie here , and know nothing of the affair ? He made his excuse , quivered and shook . He said , he heard a little noise in the night , and got up , and a cat came and purred about him , and he went to bed again , and did not hear any thing of it . This pistol was loaded and primed , and lay upon the outside of the bureau . The thing was very artfully managed : there were marks of clay upon the bench , and the mark of a man 's foot upon the lock . Q . Not the mark of a man 's foot upon the lock ? Dalton . There was some clay , not the mark of a man 's foot entirely ( as if he might put his toe there ) the same mark upon a chair : there was a bundle of linen tied up in order to be taken away ; there was a great deal of linen in the kitchen , which was untouched ; this silver medal and this copper medil lay in the drawer where my money was untouched . In short , my Lord , there was no individual thing that I missed at that time , but the guineas and the Portugal piece . On the inside of the garden wall there is a support of brick work ; those bricks were loose , which I suppose was done to favour the notion of somebody 's coming over the wall : this was in the height of the street robbing , and I concluded it must be some of those creatures , and did believe somebody had broke into the house , and should have believed so till this day , if it had not been found out in a very odd manner . I went to the City Marshal , and did my endeavour to find out who the people were . I sent this very man ( the Prisoner ) he brought me several messages , and seemed most industrious to find out the rouges ; and one favourable message that he brought me from the City Marshal was , that there was a scent of the rogues , and that twelve men were gone after them , and that they had set them in a wood , but they got from them . I spoke to Mr. Jones about this formal story , and he said he did not tell him so . Q . Tell how this was discovered . Dalton . The Prisoner continued with me very near five weeks after this , and asked to go into the country to see his friends . I gave him leave to go for three weeks , he did not return to his time , nor in nine weeks : in this interval one Mary Harris came to enquire for him at my house ; I told her he was gone into the country , that he promised to return in such a time , but had not . She said he had told her a very great lie , for he had got her to buy three pound of tea for him , which he said he would pay her for the next day , and had sent her word he had his leg broke the day before . Her telling me that he had wronged her of three pound of tea , opened my eyes , and made me believe he was the person that did this , and then I made my enquiries . He said he was going to Sheffield in Yorkshire . I got a recommendation to a gentleman , and found he had been there : upon examination I missed half a chest of Florence wine , thirty pound weight of indigo , which stood in a cask in the parlour open . He stole as much sattin as made him a waistcoat , - two yards of sattin ; mine was a yellow sattin , but he has got it died green ( he had nothing but a frock when he came to me ) he bought a new suit of clothes , a black coat , a pair of buckles , which cost 28 s. some china , which he sent into the country . Here is his box , it was by this box he was found out : the box is directed . To Henry Cutler , to be left at the Bell Inn in Wood street till called for . I saw it opened , and the waistcoat , which I believe to be my sattin , was in it - Mr. Jones stopped it , and ordered whoever came for it should be secured . On Tuesday sev'night at night one William Cord , a waterman at Greenwich , came for it . The Prisoner wrote me a letter about a fortnight before , and said he was coming to town , and would make me sufficient amends for staying so long . When he came to town , he was hankering about the house three days , and then sent a person to me . I secured the person , and he directed me where to go to the Prisoner . I sent a couple of men down to Greenwich , and had him taken there . Henry Clapcot . This green sattin that this waistcoat is made of is of my dying , but I can not swear the Prisoner brought it to me ; it was yellow before : it is the same breadth and same selvidge as this bit of yellow , that Mr. Dalton has here . The latter end of November there was some indigo brought to me to be sold , and he has confessed since , that he was the person who sold me some indigo , but I can not swear the Prisoner is the person , for I was sick in bed then . I gave 3. or 3 s 6 d. a pound for it - it was French indigo . Prisoner . I have received several sums of money for my master , and never wronged him of any . Dalton . He never received but one sum , that was 35 l. He brought it to me honestly . It was before this happened . I never suspected him before I found this out . Jacob Stokes . Last Wednesday was sev'nnight Mr. Dalton 's servant and I went down to Greenwich , ( the Prisoner was in custody ) and the Prisoner said , master , forgive me , and I will confess all . Mr. Dalton said I will have nothing to do with you , I will have you to London : we went to a house in Clement 's Lane , and there he confessed he took a chest of Plorence wine out of his master 's warehouse , and carried it to the Castle in Wood-street , and that it was directed , A. Cutler Sheffield . I asked him about the indigo ; he said he sold seven pound of it to a dyer at the Angel in Holborn : he said there was a bit of sattin , that he stole . I asked him about the money , but that he absolutely denied : when he asked his master to forgive him , and he would confess all , Mr. Dalton said he could not do that , but he would use him with mercy and lenity . Theophilus Boswell . I was sent for to the Red Lion in Clement 's Lane by Mr. Dalton , Mr. Stokes told me the Prisoner had made a confession , and shewed me a paper with some particulars wrote down . I asked the Prisoner if he was guilty of taking all those things he had confessed . He said , Mr. Boswell , really I am , and then I set my name to it . Mary Harris . The Prisoner once came to me , and asked me , if I could sell a little blue for him ; I made him answer , go to the chandler 's shops ; he said it was for the dyer 's use , and was between his young mistress and him . He came one night and pulled out some money to pay for something , and he said he had received twenty or thirty pounds from a relation abroad . Mrs. Dalton said she would not condemn him for the money , for he had received money for his master , and brought it home honestly . Q . When did he receive the 25 l. for you ? Dalton . I can not tell it I was to be taken and hanged . Q . How long did he keep the money ? Dalton . Not an hour , for he was not gone above an hour . Prisoner . I received other sums of money beside , that . Dalton . I do not believe he ever received day other sum . Prisoner . Did not I received fifteen or sixteen guineas of one Mr. Wetherall in Smithfield , a little before Lord Mayor 's Day ? I paid it you at the Bull Porters in Thames Street under the gateway . Dalton . I can not recollect any thing of it . Prisoner . Here is a person can prove that I had this suit of clothes they charge me with before Lord Mayor 's Day . Thomas Cooper . I saw the Prisoner with these clothes on Lord Mayor 's Day , or thereabouts . Q . Do you mean before or after ? Cooper . I believe it was there or thereabouts ; I do not know whether Lord Mayor 's Day was on a Saturday or Monday , but to the best of my knowledge he was at my house with this suit of clothes on the Sunday , and told me he had them out of the country from his friends : they were much about this colour . Guilty 39 s . + He was also indicted for stealing twenty flasks of Florence wine , value 8 s. and a chest , value 4 d. the property of Miles Dalton , in his warehouse , October 26 . Miles Dalton . The Prisoner has confessed that he sent this wine down in the country , and directed it , A. Cutler Sheffield - it was pricked wine ; I had sold some chests at that price , so I charged no more . Guilty 4 s. 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 181 . + Robert Catherall * , was indicted for forging and counterfeiting a certain acceptance on a bill of exchange ; which said bill of exchange is in the words , abbreviations of words , and figures following . * He was tried in the mayoralty of Sir Robert Willimott , upon a capital indictment , and acquitted . See Sessions paper , numb . VI . part 2. fol : 218. trial 231 . He was an evidence on the trial of Lydia Collet ( who was transported in the mayoralty of Sir Robert Westley ) to prove that she was in another place at the time the fact which she was charged with was committed . See Sessions paper numb . III . pag . 78. trial 164 . ' October 8th , 1744 . ' Pay to Mr. Robert Catherall , or order , l. 21 ' thirty days after sight , and place it to the account ' of your most humble servant , THOMAS PIERCE . ' To Mr. Thomas Simpson , at the corner of ' Crutched friers bar , Tower-hill , London . ' And that he did willingly assist in forging and counterfeiting a certain paper writing , under the hand of Thomas Simpson ; which said last mentioned paper writing is as follows : ' Accepted , Oct. 13. THOMAS SIMPSON . ' With an intent to defraud Thomas Simpson , of London , merchant ; against the form of the statute , & c. He was also charged with uttering and publishing the same , knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited , with an intent to defraud the said Thomas Simpson . He was likewise charged with uttering and publishing the same , with an intent to defraud Sarah Giles , widow . The indictment was also laid for forging the said bill of exchange , and for uttering and publishing the same , knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited , with an intent to defraud the said Sarah Giles . This was laid to be done at the parish of St. Mary the Virgin in Aldermanbury , and after the 24 h of June , 1734 , to wit , on the 16th of October , in the 18th year of his present Majesty 's reign . The Counsel for the Prosecutor having opened the indictment , proceeded to call their witnesses . - Mulliner . I am servant to Mrs. Giles in Addle-street . I think it was on the 15th of October , the Prisoner came into the shop , and asked Mr. Giles [ my mistress 's son ] if he sold nails . Mr. Giles told him , he did . He said , he wanted a parcel of nails , and if he would sell him as cheap as another , he would buy them of him . Mr. Giles asked him , what sort of nails he would have ? I think he said , ten-peny nails . Mr. Giles asked him , whether they must be rose-headed nails , or clasp headed nails . He said , he could not tell ; but they were to go into the country . Then I concluded they were to be rose-headed nails . He said there was a vessel lying ready for them . He pulled out a paper , whereon was wrote down what he wanted . He desired they might be looked out , and said , he would call for them in the morning . I told him , they would come to about 13 or 14 l. I went into the counting-house to Mr. Giles , and told him what the Prisoner said . Mr. Giles said to him , You are a stranger to me , and I shall expect the money . He said , he should have the money before the goods went away . Here is a note , said he , on one Mr. Simpson on Tower-hill . I looked on the bill , and there was not the name of any town upon it . Says I , Where had you this bill ? He said , he had it from Yarmouth in Dorsetshire ; and that he had done work , as a carpenter , for this Mr. Pierce , near Yarmouth Mr. Giles said , he would take the bill , and send it to Mr. Simpson 's . The Prisoner said , he would go with him himself . Mr. Giles said , he was busy then , and could not go . There were some brads in the order : I asked him , what sort . He could not tell , but I should know in the morning . I went to Mr. Simpson 's , and shewed the bill to one of his clerks , and asked , if it was a good bill . He looked upon it two or three minutes , and said , it was not a good bill : Mr. Simpson looked upon it , and said the same . I told him how I came by it . He said , he should be glad to have the person who brought it apprehended . I told him , he was to come in the morning . I went home , and acquainted Mr. Giles with it , and went afterwards to Mr. Simpson 's , to desire he would send his clerk to be there , for we did not care to apprehend him ourselves . Mr. Simpson accordingly sent his man to our house , and when the Prisoner came , we sent for a constable , and secured him . [ The bill was produced and read . ] Prisoner . There happened to be two Thomas Simpsons , which I did not know of ; the bill was a very good bill to me . Counsel . Do you know two Thomas Simpsons . Mulliner . I know only one Thomas Simpson , and he lives at Crutched Friers Bar . Prisoner . He lives opposite to the other Thomas Simpson . Mr. Thomas Simpson , merchant . I live at the corner of Crutched Friers Bar on Tower Hill . Counsel . Is this your hand-writing ? Thomas Simpson . It is not ; Mr. Giles 's young man brought it to me , and said he took it in payment ; I said he should stopt it till I could have a better account of it ; he said he believed he should see the person in the morning , and I desired they would secure him . The Prisoner the next morning before the Justice said he had it from Yarmouth in Dorsetshire , of one Thomas Pierce . I asked , whether he was a farmer , or what . He said he was a farmer or a hop-merchant . I asked him , which way he came ; he said , by sea . I asked him , how long he had been in town ; he said , a fortnight . The bill being dated the 8th of October , I thought this very inconsistent . This is the bill . It is drawn by Thomas Pierce on Thomas Simpson ; I did not accept this bill . The Prisoner was not committed by Sir John Thompson that day , but was continued in custody . I went to one Mr. Dobson , the landlord of that house , and asked him who had taken it ; Mr. Dobson said one Thomas Pierce had taken it , and Mr. Dobson shewed me the schedule of the things in the name of Thomas Pierce , but before quarter day every person was gone out of the house . This Simpson , who lived opposite to me , said he was a cyder merchant , but I question whether there was any Thomas Simpson lived there , for I believe the person 's name was Pierce . Prisoner . I can not be guilty of this , for I can not write . Mulliner . Though he says he can not write , he offered to indorse the bill . Prisoner . Thomas Pierce paid me the note for money lent him : he was a pastry cook in Newgate Street . John Amler . I know there were two Thomas Simpsons , one Thomas Simpson lived at the corner of Crouched Priers , and I know his handwriting , because he was an excise officer with me . I know Pierce 's hand-writing too , but I do not know any thing of his affairs , either of the drawing the bill , or anything . The body of the note is neither Pierce 's nor Simpson 's hand writing : the acceptance is Simpson 's hand-writing . This Thomas Simpson lived in the corner house on the right hand , and the other gentleman lives on the left hand . Acquitted . The Counsel for the Prosecutor moved the Court , that the Prisoner might be continued in custody , that he might be indicted for perjury , in a cause which was lately tried in the Court of Admiralty ; and he was ordered to be continned . 182 . + Edward Bryant , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing a silver tankard , value 7 l. the property of Hugh Griffith , in his dwelling-house , October 29 . Hugh Griffith . I live at the Bear by the New Bridge at Westminster . Last Lord Mayor 's Day was twelve months I lost a silver tankard , one Mr. Ambleford was drinking in my house up one pair of stairs , and had a silver tankard carried up to him . The Prisoner at the bar had spread a report about the parish , that he had received the tankard into his panniers [ he goes about with an ass and panniers , and sells things . ] Mr. Ambleford the other witness , who was a very honest gentleman , was put into despair about this , and about two or three weeks ago cut his throat . Edward Bagley . I had a warrant to take up the Prisoner . On the 31st of January last he was going with his ass and panniers ; sad I , Mr. Bryant , you must go along with me upon the account of the silver tankard ; he said he would go with me . Q . What did he say about the tankard ? Bagley . He said he had the tankard , but that he did not steal it ; and before Sir Thomas De Veil he said he did not know who put it into his panniers . Sir Thomas asked him , whether he did not say that he knew who put it into the panniers ; then he said he was with his ass and panniers , and that he did receive the tankard out of Mr. Griffith 's house from a person he knew very well , whom he had known three years . Said I , if you have known the person three years , can not you tell who it was ? then he said it was one Crisp a turner in the Broad Way ( who is a man of as good a character as any in that parish . ) Mr . Crisp went voluntarily to Sir Thomas De Veil 's , and then the Prisoner asked Mr . Crisp 's pardon , and said he was not the man he had the tankard from . - Tubb . I heard the Prisoner say he received the tankard : that a person brought the tankard out of the house , and he received it into his panniers at a proper place , and in Channel Row he let the man take the tankard out again , but he would not tell who the man was : Now , says he , what will you do ? He said it was above a twelve-month ago , and he thought we could not do any thing to him , or he would not have spoke any thing of it . Acquitted . 183.

Ann Plampin , was indicted for stealing fourteen pound weight of tobacco , value 4 s. the goods of persons unknown , February 14 . John Sturgeon . I met the Prisoner in Water Lane by the Custom-house ; she had something in her apron ; I asked her what she had got there ; she said , go look , with that I rummaged her , and found it to be tobacco , which I carried to his Majesty 's warehouse . The next day she came to me again , and desired me to give her her apron ; I told her I could not do that , it was not in my power . I acquainted Mr. Clack the Keys Constable with it , and she was taken up . Prisoner . I was going along when he spoke to me , and thought he was upon his game : he cut my apron off my sides . Sturgeon . I pulled it off with my hand . William Clack . Mr. Sturgeon brought the Prisoner to me , and asked me if I knew her . I said I knew something of her face , but did not know that she ever stole any thing . I took her to be a dealer , one that buys from them that steal . She told the sitting Alderman she would be hanged before she would confess . I believe she deals in uncustomed tobacco . Acquitted . 185.
