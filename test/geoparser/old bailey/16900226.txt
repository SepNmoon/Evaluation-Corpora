The Tryal lasted very long , and abundance of Witnesses were called for the King , amongst which were two Apprentices , viz . Edward Newhall , and Thomas Albrook , & c. The former of which declared , that , on Monday the 20th of January last , his Mistris found the Maid to have a Shilling about her , and demanded how she came by it ? The Maid confest at first , that she had one 6d . of one Mrs. Baker , and the other of one Susannah Middleton ; which her Mistriss being doubtful of , she ty 'd her to the Beds-post , and whipt her very sorely , and on Wednesday following she deny 'd it . Upon which , her Mistriss grew extreamly enraged at her , and struck her two or three Blows with a Whip , and proceeded further in her passion , even in causing him to tye her to the Beds-post , where she whipt her in a most violent manner , until the cry 'd out Murther . To prevent which , her Mistriss stopt her Mouth with her Hand , but then on the Saturday following , she tyed her Neck and Heels , and afterwards tyed her to the Beds post , burning her with the Fire-Poker upon the Neck , Shoulders , and Back , after a most inhuman manner , and then gave her a Blow on the Head with a Hammer , until she made her confess to have been confederate with some Thieves who intended to Rob her Master 's House while he was at Bristol Fair . Then she had the Maid before a Justice on the next Monday , being the day before she dyed , where she confessed the like , & c. After which , her Mistriss grew careless of her ; For when she fell sick upon it , she would not let her have those Accommodations that were fit for a person in that deplorable Condition , but was heard to say , Hang her , Hang her ; And that if she had not confest , she would have kill 'd her . She could no ways be prevail 'd upon to take any pity upon her Servant , nor give her any sustenance : But , on the contrary , cry 'd out , Who can do any thing for such a Wretch ? Telling them , that she had the Pox , & c. The Surgeon said , that the Stripes and Wounds did contribute towards her Death , together with a Surfeit she had taken before . The prisoner strived to Extenuate her Crime , saying , That her Maid had wronged her several times , by making away her Goods , and Money , and had Conversation with a parcel of Thieves , and was a Girl of a very sullen , obstinate , temper ; and the reason why she Whipt her , was , for opening her Dressing-Box . She called some Witnesses , who gave a favourable account of her former Education , but none that could contradict or invalidate the King 's Evidence ; only one of them said , that the Maid complained of a stoppage at her stomach , and a great pain in her head , before she was so used ; and that she surfeited her self by eating Ice Cakes , and Apples , & c. all which did not avail her any thing ; but the Jury looking upon the Heinousness of the Fact , brought in her guilty of wilful Murther .
