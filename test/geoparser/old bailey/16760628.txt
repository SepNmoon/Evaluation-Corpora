London : Printed for D.M . 1676 . A true Narrative of the Sessions . This Sessions began at Justice Hall in the Old Bailey , on Wednesday , the 28th of June ; on which day a great number of Malefactors were Arraigned and Tryed for several Crimes ; particularly , A Sexton was Indicted for killing a man ; the business hapned thus , The Boys being abroad in Procession , the Prisoner led one party , and meeting with those of another Parish , who had a Parish Clarke going before them , these two Leaders fell out about the Bounds and Limits of their respective Parishes , and several words of heat and passion having past between them , the Prisoner suddenly snatcht a Cudgel from one of his Boys , and laid the other Man over the Head with it , so unlucky a blow , that he fractured his Skull , whereof he shortly after died : there were a multitude of Witnesses examined , which made the Trial very tedious ; but after a full hearing , the Jury brought it in Manslaughter . Another person was tried about the Death of a Man , who upon a quarrel went by consent to a Fencing School , to play two or three Hits at Backsword ; but it was the Prisoners ill luck to hit his Adversary a little too severely , so that it was alleadged that the Blows occasioned his Death , which in some time after happened ; but it not being sufficiently proved that this was the real cause , the Prisoner was acquitted . A boy was Cast for his Life for Felony , he came privately into a Gentleman 's house in St. Gile 's , and hiding himself had stoln a Silver Tankard , and two Silver Spoons ; but the Maid discovering him , he slily set the Tankard down again , and flinging down the Maid , got out of the house and fled ; but she making pursuit after him , found he was got into an Ale-house by Red Lion Fields , where he was at first denied , but upon search discovered , yet had time enough to dispose of the Spoons , which were found in the next Room ; and because they were not taken about him , he had the impudence to plead Innocency : But though he were but young in years ( not above Fourteen ) yet it appeared he had been an old Thief , having been burnt in the Hand in February last ; so that he was found Guilty . The next was an object of Pitty , a little Boy about Twelve Years of Age , newly come to be an Apprentice at a Shop in Fleet street , about the seventeenth instant June , being about the time when the Trained Bands of London went out to Muster , finding in his Masters Dining Room , up one pair of Stairs , a Musquet which had been in use upon that occasion , had a Childish desire to be doing something like a Soldier ; and to try whether the Piece were charged or not , put the Gunstick into the Barrel ; and perceiving there was a Charge in it , scrap 'd together some loose corns of Powder scattered on the Table , and put them into the Pan ; but being suddenly called down by his Mistriss , to serve some Customers in the Shop , assoon as that business was dispatcht got up again , and having forgot that he had left the Rammer in the Barrel , goes towards the Balcony , and fires the Musquet at random into the Street , in the middle of the day : and so unfortunately it happened , that an ancient Citizen passing by over the way at that instant , the aforesaid Gunstick driven by the force of the Powder gave him a mortal Wound in the Back , a little below the left Shoulder ; so that immediately falling , before or almost assoon as he could be taken up and got into the next Shop , he died , being only heard to pronounce these words , Ah Lord ! I am killed -- -- I am a dead man . In the mean time the Boy little thought what mischief he had done , and was only troubled at the loss of the Gunstick , which he missed assoon as he had discharged the Piece . But many people hearing the report of the Gun , and seeing from whence it proceeded , presently ran thither to enquire ; going up stairs they finde the Boy with the Gun , who confessed he had shot it off ; but when they told him , he had killed a Man , he struck his hand on his Breast , crying out , Ah ! What shall I do , I am undone : testifying that he did not intend or imagine any hurt to any Creature , and expressing much sorrow for the same , as he did now likewise upon his Tryal . Some pieces of the Gunstick were produced in Court by the Chyrurgeon , which were taken out of the Gentleman 's Heart . The Jury could do no less than bring it in Manslaughter ; the Court having declared their opinion before , that under these Circumstances it must be more than Chance-medley since he shot off the Gun premeditately and voluntarily , though the killing the man was accidental . There was a long Tryal upon a Writ of Restitution against a Quaker , who it seems out of pure Conscience to gratifie himself and friends by under-selling his Neighbours , had been moved to trade in stolen goods , there being no less than one hundred and fifty dozen of Kids-leather Gloves ( as was testified ) bought by him of a Thief and his wife at twelve shillings a dozen , within these three years last past ; for which the Jury brought in Eighty pounds against him : upon which 't is odds if he do not amongst his party make a sad complaint of grievous Persecution . A Country-fellow was tried for having two Wives ; the first he married neer Tame in Oxfordshire , and liv 'd with her several years , and had two pretty children ( a Boy and a Girl ) which were brought into Court to see the wickedness of the Father : After that he left that Wife , and at Harrow on the Hill married another , whom only he was pleased to own in Court ; so that there needed no proof on her behalf : and as for the first woman she proved her marriage by the Clerk that was present , and by her Mother and several others , who testified a long Cohabitation , & c. so that he was found guilty , but seemed not much to lay that to heart , flattering himself with coming off by his Clergy , but in vain ; for when afterwards he came to the Book , the Ordinary returned a Non legit , and he received sentence of death with the rest . Another Fellow , living about White chapel , was Indicted for having two Wives ; but only the last , whom he owned , appeared , who having told her Story , and being commanded out of the Court , briskly beckned her hand to her Husband , as he stood at the Bar , and cryed out aloud , Come John , come away with me ; and indeed he might , if he had but paid his Fees , and a mind to it , soon after follow her ; for he was necessarily brought in not guilty , when no body was to accuse him . Two women Convicts detained in Newgate in order for transportation , for their several Crimes , had laid a plot according to the usual Policy of that place , to get a little money before they went ( for we have scarce charity enough to think twas out of pure Conscience ) which was , to send to several persons whom they had formerly robbed , acquainting them that they could inform them where the things lost were disposed of ; and accordingly upon a treaty and a small spill in the hand , and somewhat more promised , they did , naming two others to whom , as they said , they had sold the things ( 't was most Plate ) at very underrates , as Silver Tankards at Three Shillings the Ounce , and the like ; and freely confessed several Circumstances of themselves being concerned in the Felony , imagining that after his Majesties Pardon , or rather Remission or change of the Sentence of Death into Transportation , they could not here have been called to any account for past Crimes ; but the Court made them sensible of their mistake , by assuring them , that only extended to the Facts for which they were then convicted , and now they were arraigned for these Felonies of their own Confession and so unluckily it happened , that both the persons they brought into trouble as Accessaries were now acquitted , and themselves cast as Principals . A Woman received Sentence to be pressed to Death for refusing to plead , not only the last Sessions , but continuing now in the same obstinacy , though several times importuned by the Court not to cast away her Life , being only charged with stealing of Plate upon which if found Guilty , she might at worst have had the favour of Transportation ; but in kindness to some Cronies in Goal , whom she would first have released , she continued still resolute not to take any Tryal , unless they might be discharged ; whereupon the Court proceeded to pronounce Judgment against her as aforesaid . Several other Felons , & c. were tryed , which would be too tedious to relate : upon the whole matter there were five that received Judgement of death Three men and Two Women ; Seven burnt in the Hand ; Four begg 'd Transportation ; and Three to be whipt for Petty Lacerny ; And so the Sessions ended with the Moneth .
