The next morning he came to make his complaints to me , told me what he had lost , and wanted me to go with him to endeavour to get them again . I told him I could not go then . On the Tuesday morning he came and told me he had found out the place where he was robbed , and showed me one of the buckles . We got a warrant and had it executed ; and when the Prisoner was before the Justice , she owned every article except either the hat or wig , I can not tell which . Q . What did she say , did she own she took them from him ? Hughes . She said she knew of them , and if the Justice would indulge her to let the Constable go home with her , she would show him where the buckles were , and she said they were under a brick in her cellar . The Constable and I went with her , she found the brick but did not find the buckles , then she said that one Sullivan , who she said was run away , or something to that purpose , told her she had left them under a brick in the cellar for her , but she did not know , what Sullivan had done with them .

I got one of my buckles again , and I paid 5 s. 1 d. for the other two , [ a large pair of shoe buckles . ] There was one of the buckles he did not take away , which I suppose stuck in my pocket , for I put the buckles under this pair of stockings in my pocket that nobody should find them . He said before the Justice ( as I understood him ) that he found them . Prisoner . There was another man in the bed along with us . Holloway . I went to bed so still that the other man did not know of it , and I did not know that any body was in the bed ; I hear the other is as honest a man as any in the world . John Bundock .

She said , she wondered I should say so , for her honesty was never questioned ; and she declared she did not do it . She went out of my house , and was dogged into a pawnbroker 's shop , at the Hand and Lock of Hair in Shoe-lane . She came back again afterwards , and still said , she had nothing of mine . Then I said I must charge a Constable with her . One Mr. Wilson said , it does not signify any thing talking , for I saw you go into a pawnbroker 's , and I know some of the goods . Then she fell a crying , and bid me put my hand into her pocket , and take out the key of her room , and I should find a great many of the things .

She said the things were under her bed ; and accordingly I found part of the goods there , and part at Mr. Sheldon 's , the pawnbroker . I found my daughter 's mantelet , and several other things , at Mr. Weyburne 's , the Five Roses in Shoe-lane . And before my Lord Mayor she cried , and owned the fact .

About 8 or 9 , or it may be 10 weeks ago , I can not tell which , as I was coming over Flemish church yard , near Tower-hill ( I lived there then ) with a butter tub , about five o'clock in the evening , Dick Carberry knocked me down ; then he tore my apron off my sides , and took my pocket with five or six shillings in it - I knew him when he came up to me - I have seen him several times - He had a room in the next house to my mother 's , that came over her shop - It was pretty light , it was neither light nor dark - It was not so dark as to want the light of the lamps - I knew him after I got up again . I did not know him at first . After I got up I said , Pray Mr. Carberry do n't meddle with me . And he beat me , and said , you B - h , I will knock your brains out . Q . Did you make any resistance ? Milward . No , Sir - I complained of it about three or four days afterwards . Q . What was the reason you did not take him sooner ? Milward . Because I could not take him - I had known him in that neighbourhood about three or four months - After he had robbed me he run away directly - He did return to his habitation again , but when I can not tell . Q . Was it two days , or did he return the next day ? Milward . I ca n't tell whether it was the next day , or the fourth day - I believe he was taken up upon the account of Justice Willoughby 's being knocked down on Tower-hill ; and there was a report that he did it - He went on board of ship after that - I complained to Justice Dennet three or four days after the robbery ; and he sent a warrant for him , and he broke out backwards , and got away - He had been seen before that , but it was only in the night . Jury . Why did not you cry out stop thief ? Milward . If I had , no body would have taken him . Prisoner . I did not do any thing to you . You run away as soon as I said to you , You B - h , you are one of them that robbed me last night . Milward . He did rob me - I knew him by the light of the day - There are several shops there . Jury . Did not you cry out ? Milward . I made a great noise ; but when the people saw who it was , they shut their doors , they were afraid of him , he is so desperate a fellow . Prisoner . The night before this happened , another midshipman and I went into the bawdy-house which is kept by her or her mother , and we drank pretty freely . She took a laced hat and 2 guinea from this gentleman , and three shillings and six-pence from me . Said I , my girl , you have got a guinea from this gentleman , and a laced hat . She said she knew nothing of it . They had stripped us so , that we had not money to pay our reckoning . And then they and their bullies sell upon us so , that we had like to have been murdered . There were a matter of sixteen whores of them together . So the next day , about three o'clock , I met this girl , and said , You B - h , you are one of the whores that robbed me last night . And so she charges me with robbing her . Sarah Cooper . I live in the neighbourhood , Catharine Milward , the Prosecutrix 's mother-in-law , kept a vile house . The Prisoner goes to sea , I never saw any harm of him , I saw him run after the daughter and throw her down . - About two o'clock in the afternoon . Q . What character has the Prisoner , has he the character of a thief ? Cooper . I never heard any such character of him , he is reckoned a civil man . Q . Did she complain then that he had robbed her ? Cooper . She did not complain of any thing , she sat down upon the bench a little , and then walked home . Sarah Willis . The Prisoner has lodged with me several times when he came from sea , he lodged with me about three weeks ago . - I never heard that he had the character of a thief . Elizabeth Studly . As to his robbing her , I believe he robbed her of nothing , for I believe she had not a farthing in the world . - I never heard any harm of Elizabeth Milward - the mother has the character of keeping a disorderly house . Acquitted . 217. Richard Carberry , was a second time indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling house of Catharine Milward in the night time , and stealing one silk gown , value 5 s. four cambrick aprons , value 10 s. six handkerchiefs , value 5 s. five suits of cambrick headclothes , value 10 s. fourteen guineas and seventeen shillings in money , the property of Catharine Milward , January 26 . Catharine Milward . The Prisoner has lodged in a room over my head since last Michaelmas , he came into my house in the middle of the day , with a woman he calls his wife , and he and my daughter had some words ; he came bodily into the house . Q . What do you mean by bodily ? Milward . He came with a great stick , and he gave me a blow upon my arm , that I had like to have lost the use of it - it was the day the warrant was taken out . Q . What upon your daughter 's affair ? Milward . No , that was the last thing he did , it was upon the account of a quarrel , it was all within a day or two of one another ; he came again about six or seven at night . I asked who was there , I believe he changed his voice , said my daughter , that 's Carberry 's voice . God forbid , said I , but I opened the door , in he came with two pistols in his hands , and a cuttean cross his month . My daughter hid herself behind the back door , and I got out of his fight , but I stood so that I could see what he did . He was in a great passion , and broke the chairs , shelves and things to pieces : there was a lad going by with a link , he got the link from the lad , laid about with one of the pistols , and broke the windows till he was tired with that . Then he took his stick and laid about with one and the other , and broke all the glasses and several bottles of small beer . And at the same time there was a mob of 100 people about the door . - There was a great mob , he threw the goods out into the street , and I went and picked up what I could , for I thought I had better have them than not , and he came out several times before all the people , and no body dared to meddle with him . Then he searched for my daughter and found her , he put a pistol to her breast and said , D - n you you B - h , if you speak a word you are a dead woman . Then he took a box with all these goods and money in it , and put it out at the window , his wife and the landlady he lives with were at the outside of the window , and took the box entirely away , and they carried it up stairs into his own house . And he not only took away all my things , but cut my clothes off my back in the street . The next day I got a warrant from Justice Jones , and I told the Constable what a dangerous man he was , but he could not take him . Q . Have not you got the Constable here ? Milward . No ; Justice Dennet said there was no occasion for him . The Governor of the Tower ( I think it was the Governor ) sent the whole grand guard , and as they came into the house he got over Esquire Willoughby 's garden . - One that he was supposed to be a highwayman about , and so got off . - How he came to be taken I can not tell , but I think he was taken upon suspicion of robbing Capt . Pidgeon . Elizabeth Milward , confirmed the evidence of her mother in many particulars . She adds , that after he had done a great deal of mischief , in beating and abusing them and breaking the windows , he asked if they had any thing to drink , that not having any thing he went up into his own room , came down again , and then broke the shelves and every thing all to pieces . She says , that the people were afraid of him , that she sent to the Constable and Watchmen too and they would not come , and that the watch was not set ; that she could have brought a great many people to have proved this , but the Justice said there was no occasion for any body but her mother and herself . Prisoner . Ask her how she gets her living ? Elizabeth Milward . I deal in Rag-Fair . Jonas Ogden . I have lived in the parish these twenty years , and the Prisoner about three years , when he or I went out , he used to pull his hat off to me in a very reverend manner . He is a very civil man , but Milward kept a very disorderly house . They swore another time before this , that I broke the windows , and I paid 3 s. 6 d. for what I never did . Sarah Cooper . - I do n't believe the Prisoner took the value of this bit of paper away , for all the neighbourhood believes they were not robbed of a pin . Q . Do you think they would perjure themselves upon oath ? Cooper . I can not tell that ; the daughter was tried here a little before Christmas , for robbing a * man of his watch . * Elizabeth Milward was tried last December Sessions for privately stealing a watch from the person of George Coombs , and acquitted , page 6. trial 13. Sarah Mills . I am landlady to the Prisoner . Q . Do you know any thing of a box or trunk that was delivered to you by the Prisoner out of Milward 's house ? Mills . I was in bed , I do n't know what they did . Q . Do you think they would forswear themselves ? Mills . Yes , I believe they would , I believe they do n't care whose life they swear away . Eliz . Studly . I lodge in the house with the Prisoner , he owned that night that he had been fighting with them and beating them , he was drunk and quarrelsome . - I did not see he had any pistols or a cutteau . Q . Do you remember any soldiers coming from the Tower to take the Prisoner ? Studly . Mrs. Milward did bring them down , but they did not take him ; he was there when they first came down , but they would not meddle with him . Q . Did not he make his escape then ? Studly . He went away then , but he came again two or three days afterwards , and appeared publickly every day . - Elizabeth Milward complained to Justice Jones and wanted a warrant , but that was only for beating her . Q . Do you think that they would swear falsely ? Elizabeth Studly . I believe they would not stick at it in order to obtain their ends .

When I went , I left the Prisoner in charge of the house , and a cook , and a man servant , with her - I was in the house but two months before I was married , and I have been married about two months - My husband is a lieutenant in a regiment at Jamaica : he is gone into the country to take leave of his friends , before he goes to his regiment . I demanded an account of my things of the prisoner , and she put me off from one day to another for three weeks ; and then she said , she could not find them . I owed her a little money , and she said she would give me a little account , if I would pay her . Prisoner . The washerwoman has all the linnen entirely . She owes her four pound fourteen shillings and odd pence ; and she owes me eight pound seven shillings and ten-pence . Acquitted . 219 . + James Cooper , of St. George the Martyr , was indicted for stealing four cloth coats , value 3 l. a cloth waistcoat , value 10 s. a pair of cloth breeches , value 5 s. the goods of George Caswell , Esq ; March 5 . Richard Matthews . The Prisoner brought this coat to me . I had seen an advertisement of Mr. Caswell 's the day before , and took it to be one of his coats . I asked the Prisoner how he came by it . He said he bought it of an acquaintance of his who 's out of place , in order to make a surtout coat . I advised him to go with me to Mr. Caswell 's , and he went very readily . Thomas Croon . Monday , the 5th of March , I lost this coat out of the stable . I went to supper about nine o'clock , and left the lad in the stable ; and I went back into the stable about ten o'clock , and my coat , waistcoat , and great coat were gone . Q . Have you not a large dog in the yard ? Croon . Yes - he always does bark at strangers - I do n't know the Prisoner - I know no body can get into the stable , without 't is somebody the dog knows . Mr. Gillman . I lodge at Mr. Matthews 's , and was in the shop when the Prisoner brought in the coat . The advertisement was read , and nothing could be painted more exact than this . I advised Mr. Matthews to stop the Prisoner , and go to Mr. Caswell 's . The Prisoner would have gone away . I said , Friend , you must not go ; you must go to Mr. Caswell 's . He said he bought it for eight shillings , that he was then very much in liquor , and did not know the man he bought it of . - To tell you the truth , Sir , said he , I was dead drunk , and do n't know the house where I bought it ; but afterwards he said , he had it of one Newman , who was servant to Mr. Caswell . I asked him , if he knew of any of the rest of the things . He said , he did not know any thing of them , I spoke to the Justice to have the house searched where he lived , and he ordered the door to be broke open . And then the Prisoner , rather than have the door broke open , pulled a key out of his pocket ; and then he said they were in his room , and they were sent for ; and these clothes were brought , which I judge to be the same . Prisoner . Did not I discover that I had the clothes , before the butler ? Gillman . I ca n't tell what you said to the butler , but before me you said you knew of no more than that numerical coat which is there produced . George Caswell , Esq ; deposed , that after the Prisoner was committed , he went to see him , though he knew nothing of him ; but the Prisoner knew him immediately , and declared , that he had been often all over the house and stables with Newman , during the time the house was repairing , which was about a year and an half ago . Edward Bownan . I have known the Prisoner three years , he always was esteemed a very honest man , and I would entrust him with my property , notwithstanding this affair . I was informed that Mr. Newman was suspected of taking the clothes ; and I did endeavour , on the behalf of the Prisoner , to get Newman taken up . I went to Mr. Caswell , and told him , it was hard an innocent man should suffer , when the principal might be taken ; and desired Mr. Caswell to let somebody belonging to him make an information of this fact before the Justice , in order to get a warrant to take up the principal : but I could not get his assistance , and I could not get a warrant to take him up . To this Mr. Caswell replied , That he did apply to the Justice to grant a warrant to take up Newman ; but that the Justice did not think proper to grant it for the reason , that if goods are found upon a person , and a warrant was to be granted upon their information , every one would say the goods were brought to them , and by that means every person might be acquitted . George Dowdell . I have known the Prisoner eleven years , he has done a great deal of business for me in the upholders way . I have left him and his wife solely in my house when I have been in the country for four months together , and always found every thing as I left it . John Smith had known him eight or nine years ; that he lodged with him five years , and always behaved well ; and that he never saw him drunk in his life . Acquitted . 220 , 221.

John Price . I am about ten years of age . [ After he was sworn , he was asked , whether he knew what he had sworn . He said , he was to speak the truth , and nothing but the truth . ] I and Henry Dumbleton , Jack Harris , and Jack Simmonds , and another butcher 's boy , who I do n't know , took some decanters from the Fountain tavern , that stood on a board in the yard - I believe it is about a fortnight ago , and carried them to one Harry White , in George Alley , and sold them . Harris 's father sent him on board o'ship , as soon as he heard we were taken - Dumbleton is about fourteen , and Wild about fifteen - Wild was with us when the decanters were sold . Wheeler . Price said at first that Wild was concerned in taking them . Dumbleton said the decanters were at one White 's in George Alley , by the Fleet Market . I went and left word at White 's that some boys had stole some of our decanters , and sold them to them ; and if they did not send them I should come after them ; and in a little time a woman brought some of the decanters .

Thomas Hughes . I took the Prisoner into my house some time ago , as an object of distress ( he had been abroad some years for such unhappy doings as this ) out of regard to his family , hoping he would not do so again , and trusted him with the key of my chamber . But thought he was very poor , all on a sudden he had money , silver buckles , and other things . Said I , Jacob , you have committed a robbery , not thinking of myself ; but my wife missed a cambrick apron , and upon that I looked farther , and missed thirteen pound . Then I told him he had robbed me . He was very much surprised at first , but some time afterwards he said , If I am hanged there 's an end of me , for I can die but once ; and if I am transported , I shall go from whence I came , and you may do your worst .
