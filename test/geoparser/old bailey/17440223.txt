The next time the Prisoner came to my house , I challenged him with taking those nutmegs , and bid him bring them again ; he protested he had not seen a nutmeg these twelve months ; then said I , go out of my house ( he is a chocolate-maker , and works for me ) for you shall not work for me any more ; he said , it was very hard that he must lose his work for a man 's saying , that he carried him some nutmegs , and would not go ; so I took him by the collar , and told him I would charge a constable with him ; then he begged my pardon , and said he had never done so before . Q . Did he confess that he took them ? Oram . He confessed that he took them out of the cellar in my house , and carried them to a shop in Holborn , somewhere by the Turnstile , and sold them for three shillings , but would not tell me to whom .

Have you any body to your character ? Prisoner . My master will give me a character . Oram . Before this thing I took him to be as honest a fellow as any in England , he made a thousand weight of chocolate for me last year , and was to have made a thousand more ; he has worked for me five years : he offered to sell the person , to whom he offered the nutmegs , as much chocolate for half a crown a pound , as he would have .

Samuel Burroughs . My wife sent for me home , and described the Prisoner 's person and clothes to me : I got a constable , and he informed me , if I would go into Black Boy Alley , we might probably find him ; we went there , and found five or six of them scolding and fighting together : when they saw the constable , three of them run away , and we took the Prisoner and another ; when my wife saw him , she said , that is the man .

Abraham Constable . On the 3d day of Jan. being Tuesday , about ten o'clock at night , as I was coming from the Ship-Tavern at the Hermitage to my house in Burr-street ( I had a person with me with a candle and lanthorn ) passing through Brewhouse-Yard , I was overtaken , or rather run after , by four lusty young fellows , who bid the person that carried the lanthorn put out the light ( they run after me so great a pace , that I thought at first it had been a press-gang , and stood up to let them pass by ) the man not being so ready to put the light out as they would have had him , or not readily finding the door of the lanthorn , one of them knocked the man down , and the lanthorn fell and broke all to pieces ; one stood before me , and the other two stood one on each side of me ; and I think they had pistols ; but as it was dark , the light being out then , I could not see whether they had pistols or not ; they rifled my breeches , and took from me ten shillings , a pen-knife , and a tobacco-stopper and cork-skrew ; they detained me near two minutes , - and I thought they would have used me with more roughness ; for they demanded a watch of me , and searched me very narrowly for a watch , but I had none ; they then bid me go the way I came , and said , if I offered to follow them , they would blow my brains out ; upon that , I returned to the tavern from whence I came , and was very much frightened ; the next day I heard there was a person taken on Tower-Hill the same night that I was robbed ; and was sent for by Justice Dennet , who then had Francis Sherlock before him under examination , to look at the person , to see to see if I knew him to be one of the persons that robbed me . Q . How came you to be sent for ? Constable . A man was brought before Justice Dennet , for knocking down a Gentleman on Tower-Hill , and the Justice , hearing that I had been robbed , sent for me to know whether he was one of the persons that robbed me ; when I came there , I had great reason to believe , that he was one of them ; but as it was so dark when I was robbed , I could not be sure . Q . What was the name of that person ? Constable . His name is Sherlock ; when I was with him , I thought there was more in his voice to know him by than there was in the sight of him ; for the candle in the lanthorn was so soon put out , that I had not time to get a full view of them ; but Sherlock confessed the fact before the Justice , and impeached the other three , of whom the Prisoner at the bar was one . Q . Did not you take them up upon this ? Constable . Sherlock was sent to New Prison , and great search was made after the other three ; but we have heard they were sent out of town , went from place to place , and have got on board the privateers , so that they are not to be found . The Prisoner was taken three or four days ago in St. John 's Street ; I observed so much of them , that they were all well dressed , genteel , young fellows ; the Prisoner was in much the same dress as he is now . Q . What makes you think the Prisoner was one of the persons ? Constable . He seems to be about the same size ; they were young , and active ; but he has no particular mark that I can swear to him by . Francis Sherlock sworn . Q . Do you know any thing of the former witness , Mr. Constable ? Sherlock . Yes . Q . Had the Prisoner at the bar any concern in attacking , and robbing him ? Sherlock . On Monday night , the second or third of January , I can not tell which . Constable . It was Tuesday in the evening . Sherlock . I may be mistaken as to the day . Q . Who were with you when you committed that robbery ? Sherlock . There were Robert Rocket , Walter Neagle , and Charles Cleaver . Q . Where was Mr. Constable , when you pursued him ? Sherlock . He was coming along Brewhouse-yard , at the upper end of new Hermitage Street . Q . Who went up to him first ? Sherlock . Rocket was the first that overtook him . Q . Who was it that knocked the man down that had the lanthorn ? Sherlock . It was myself , I did not knock him down , I shoved him down . Q . Was the Prisoner at the bar with you at that time ? Sherlock . Yes , Neagle was before him , Rocket at his right-hand , and Cleaver at his left ; and I had hold of the man at the same time . Q . Who rifled him ? Sherlock . Cleaver and Rocket . Q . What did they take from him ? Sherlock . There were twelve shillings divided between us , the money all in six-pences , but two shillings ; a little pen-knife , and a tobacco-stopper and cork-screw in one ; Neagle had them . Q . What time o'night was this ? Sherlock . About nine or ten o'clock . Q . Where did you go afterwards ? Sherlock . I was stopped by a gentleman on Tower-Hill ; but we went into the Minories first , and divided the money , and we gave Cleaver a shilling to take the hanger out of pledge . Q . How came you to be stopped on Tower-Hill ? Sherlock . As we were going over Tower-Hill , Neagle stepped out of the road , and knocked a gentleman down . Q . Did you all four go there ? Sherlock . We all four went together , and coming over Tower-Hill , Neagle and Rocket quarrelled , because Neagle said , they ( Rocket and Cleaver ) had got some gold from Mr. Constable , and he was going to fight them with a pistol ; going up the hill , a gentleman ++ was coming along with a cloak on , muffled up , ( for it was a cold night ) Neagle struck him ; I said , You rascal , what do you strike the gentleman for ? he did not meddle with you : and I believe he was a little stunned ; then they three run away ; and I did not think he knew any thing of our being concerned in the other affair , or else I could have made my escape too , but I took his part , because no harm should come to him , and I was taken and carried to the watch-house . ++ Mr. Willoughby was knocked down on Tower-Hill , so 't is probable it was him ; but the witness did not mention any name . Q . How long had the Prisoner and you been acquainted ? Sherlock . About two years ; but I never went with him or them upon such an account before that night + . + He was concerned with them in robbing Mr. Pidgeon , 30th of December , by his own evidence , as appears by the next Trial . Prisoner . What place did we set out from that night ? Sherlock . We set out from Michael Gore 's , in Charles Street , Covent Garden , where we had been drinking of beer . Prisoner . Was this the first robbery you committed ? Sherlock . No , the first robbery was that of Mr. Pidgeon in St. Catherine 's . Cleaver . Could you go down to St. Catharine 's without danger of being pressed ? Sherlock . We did go to St. Catharine 's , and were waiting to rob one Esquire Wynn ; but missing of him , we met with Mr. Constable in the mean time . Prisoner . It is true indeed I did go out that night with that gentleman the evidence , and he said he was going to a public house to Mr. Wynn , to borrow a little money of him ; and he said he was sure of getting some liquor , if he did not get some money ; and we met at this Rocket 's house , and set out about six o'clock that night . He asked me to go down with him to St. Catharine 's , for he did not care to go without company , for fear of being pressed . At last he prevailed upon me to go with him , and I did go . I went to see an acquaintance of mine in St. Catharine 's , and staid with her till ten o'clock , and happened to meet these three persons : I asked them how they did , and where they had been , but they did not care to tell in particular where . We went into the Minories to drink , and when we came into the house , Rocket pulled out some money , and so did Neagle ; I think it was about three shillings apiece . Q . Had you no part of it ? Prisoner . I had not a farthing , only a shilling to get the hanger out of pawn ; and Neagle said to me , if I would go to his lodging , at the Fountain and Shovel in Thames Street , he would make me drink ; and he said , I can tell you what passed at Tower-Hill , for I was present with them : I did not think I should have been tried , till the person who they say is taken , is brought to London ; or I should have been able to have made a better defence . Guilty Death . 155 . + Charles Cleaver , was a second time indicted for assaulting Richard Pidgeon on the highway , in the Parish of St. Botolph Aldgate , putting him in fear , and taking from him one guinea , and one shilling , and three pence , Dec. 30 . Richard Pidgeon . On Friday the 30th of December , I was going home from St. Catharine 's into Burr Street , where I live ; and going cross the way from the King 's brewhouse , I saw four men standing and laughing ; as I passed them , one of them took hold of me , and asked me what ship I belonged to : I answered them , what was that to them . Then another came up to me , and told me , I must go before their officer : I walked about four or five steps , and their officer , as they called him , came up to me , and put a pistol to me , and told me , if I opened my mouth , he would blow my brains out , and demanded my money : I told him , I had very little : They rifled my pockets , and took a guinea , a shilling , and some half-pence . Q . Did you see any of them so as to know them again ? Pidgeon . I thought I should know the first per son that came up to me again ; which was Sherlock . The Wednesday following , Mr. Willoughby sent to acquaint me , that he was stopped the night before , and the person was taken , and desired me to go to the Tower prison , and see if I knew him . I went to the Tower prison , Sherlock was sitting by the fire-side , and I pitched upon him immediately , though I believe there were twenty people in the room . Q . Was there any light when you were robbed ? Pidgeon . There was some light ; and a little girl took me for her father ; and she stamped , and cried , Oh lah , Oh lah , what do you do to my father ? Then he that had his hand in my pocket , put his hand into his pocket ; and I was afraid it was to take out a pistol to shoot the girl . Francis Sherlock . On Friday night , the 30th of December , about seven o'clock at night , Neagle , Cleaver and Rocket were at my house in Jerusalem Court , and we went to a public house in St. John 's Square , they asked me , if I would go out upon such an affair : I said , I did not care to do it ; and they told me , I was a coward ; I said I would go with all my heart , rather than they should charge me with that . Accordingly we went into Bishopsgate Street , drank some slip , and then went into Stepney Fields , and met a boy with a link ; I saw some other peopl e , we followed them , and came up with them ; and when we came up with them , we found they were not worth any thing , so we did not speak to them ; we did not meet with any thing . Then we went to St. Catharine 's , and met captain Pidgeon ; I knew him a captain of a ship in Holland , when I was mate of a merchant-man . Q . Could you see him so as to know him ? Sherlock . I had some knowledge of him , though I did not know him certainly ; but I knew him when I saw him afterwards . Q . Who went up to him first ? Sherlock . Neagle and Rocket run after him , and asked him , What ship ? Cleaver and I were together , at a distance . - No body attacked him but them two , and they robbed him of a shilling , and some half-pence . Q . Was not there a guinea ? Sherlock . I did not see any thing of the guinea . Q . How far was you from him ? Sherlock . I was about seven or eight yards . Q . Did Cleaver go up to him ? Sherlock . Cleaver did not go near him , nor I neither . - Neagle and Rocket run after him . Q . When Neagle and Rocket run after him , you stopped , did not you ? Sherlock . When we first saw him , we were all four standing together ; and then they two run after him , and stopped him . Q . What became of the money ? Sherlock . We spent the money at a night-house in Newgate Market . Q . How much money had you ? Sherlock . There was but seventeen-pence half-penny . - Rocket might keep the guinea for what I know . Prisoner . Please to ask him , whether I had any part of the money ? Sherlock . Cleaver was not at the spending of the money ; there were only three of us . Q . Where was Cleaver then ? Sherlock . He was not well , and he said , he would go and buy some barley-sugar , or something for his cold ; he said he would come to us , but he did not come . Prisoner . I know nothing of this robbery ; indeed I did go out with them , and I saw them speak to a gentleman , and they had something in their hands , but I was gone to knock at a gentleman 's door a stone's-throw off : they asked me to go with them to Newgate Market , but I found they were for striking and abusing people as they went along , and I would not go with them ; so I went to a pastry-cook 's shop to buy some barleysugar , and then home .

Humphrey Nightingale . On the 19th of Dec. last , about six o'clock at night , I was stopped and robbed by the two persons at the bar , at the end of Wych-Street , of twenty three bottles of Hungary water , tied up in a silk handkerchief . Petty seized me by the collar with one hand , and the parcel with the other , and said , D - n you , give me your parcel . I said , I would not ; he said , D - n me , he would have it ; and I do n't know but I might say , d - n him again ; then Smith came and said , D - n you , we will have it ; he held a stick of an uncommon size over my head , and repeated many oaths , which put me in fear , and I did deliver it . Petty had hold of the parcel all the while ; as they were going off , I cried out help ! I recovered myself a little , and got Smith by the collar ; and finding myself a little stronger than him , I got him into a Butcher 's shop , that was pretty near , and desired somebody to get a Constable ; Petty got from me , but I secured Smith , and carried him before a Justice , and I said , he was one of the two men that robbed me , and he denied the taking the goods . Q . Did they make any excuse in the butcher 's shop , when you charged them with it ? Nightingale . They did not say any thing , they made no excuse . Council . Had you your goods again .

No , nor did they give me the least reason to think they were Officers of the Excise . Q . Did not they produce their deputations before the Justice ? Nightingale . Not that I remember . Q . Where had you been then ? Nightingale . I had been at Mr. Pelleret 's in Lime-street , and had bought some Hungary water ; and going home , I called upon Mr. Sandys , a dealer in tea , on Ludgate-hill . Q . Are not you a dealer in tea ? Nightingale . Yes , I am . Q . Then did not you know the Prisoners ? Nightingale . I never saw them before that time in my life to my knowledge . Q . You say , you were in a Butcher 's shop with the Prisoners ; do n't you know the Butcher 's name ? Nightingale . I do not know it . Q . Then I will put you in mind of it ; his name is Thomas Wilson . Did not they ask you to see what was in your handkerchief ? Nightingale . No , they did not . Q . Did they ask you for your money , or any thing else besides your handkerchief ? Nightingale . No , nothing else . Miles Nightingale . This bundle was taken from the Prisoners before the Justice . Q . Who carried it into the Butcher 's shop ? Nightingale . Petty did . Samuel Lee . On the 19th of Dec . I was coming down Wych-street ; there was a crowd at a Butcher 's shop , I enquired what was the matter , and they told me , a gentleman was robbed . I went in and said to Mr. Nightingale , Are you the gentleman that was robbed ? and he said , Yes . I went for a Constable , and he charged the Constable with Smith . Q . What became of Petty ? Lee . He pretended to go for a Constable , but did not return again . Another Excise-Officer ( as I was informed ) said before the Justice , that he believed he could light of this Petty , and said , he would step out and see for him ; he went out and returned again in about a quarter of an hour , and brought Petty along with him . Q . Had they any deputations ? Lee . They pretended to snew some deputation before the Justice . The Justice 's Clerk . Smith said he was an Excise-Officer , and that he seized the parcel as run goods - Petty denied the taking of the goods - They offered to produce deputations ; I can not say they did produce any . Lee . The Justice said , that the Prisoners swore directly contrary to one another . Q . What did they say ? Lee . I ca n't tell justly . Q . Then how can you say they differed in their accounts ? Tell us the sum of what they said ? Lee . I can not very well remember what was said . Q . Did Petty deny the fact before the Justice ? Lee . No , to the best of my remembrance he never did deny it . [ The Justice was of opinion , when they were before him , that it was not a robbery ; and directed the Prosecutor to prefer a bill at Hicks's-Hall for an assault . ] The PRISONERS DEFENCE . Thomas Unwin . I am Clerk to my brother , who is an Attorney . On the 19th of December , as I was going along the back-side of St. Clement 's , Mr Nightingale came by , with a bundle under his arm ; the two Prisoners came up to him , and said , they suspected that he had got some run-goods , and desired to see what he had in his bundle . Q . What did Nightingale say ? Unwin .

Mr. Smith said , they were Excise-Officers , and had been at Ludgate-Hill to see after some run tea ; Nightingale was for sending for a Constable ; and Smith bid Petty go and fetch a Constable ; and Petty went for a Constable , but did not bring any . Q . Was Nightingale close to him when he said they were Excise-Officers ? Wilson . Nightingale was as near as I ; he might have heard , for my wife and I heard . The Justice declared , that when the Prisoners were before him , they prosessed themselves to be Officers of the Excise , and showed their deputations . A worthy Alderman of this City said , he has known Petty about ten years , and always took him to be a very honest young man ; and from the knowledge he has had of him , believes him to be incapable of committing a dishonest or an unjust act . Justice Engier said , he has known Petty eight or ten years , believes him to be as honest a man as any in England , and that he would not do such a thing for the world . There was one person called to the character of Smith , who has known him from three or four years of age , and says he has a very honest , just , fair character . Acquitted .

Q . When you saw the watch , did you say any thing to the Prisoner ? Stringer .

The Prisoner when he was before me did acknowledge he was the person who broke open the shop , and let all the persons in who were concerned with him in this robbery : Those two watches and the key were produced before me . Prisoner . I know the key and the metal watch were found upon me ; I can tell how I came by that watch ; I did go to Mr. Bowers , and asked him to lend me eight pound upon the watch ; I can prove how I came by all the things : The silver watch is my own , I broke the minute hand of it myself .

The case , as laid in the indictment , was , that Winifred Jackson , having four East-India bonds in her custody , viz . N 11453 , dated Sep. 30 , 1708. which is set forth to be the property of the English Company , trading to the East-Indies . A . No 12179 , dated June 22 , 1711 . A . No 15106 , dated July 22 , 1712 . A . No 16388 , dated Nov. 16 , 1713. which are set forth to be the property of the united Company of Merchants of England trading to the East-Indies : And the East-India Company having given due and publick notice in the London Gazette , on the 21st of June , 1729. for the payment and discharge of the first of the said bonds , that bond ceased to carry any further interest from and after the 31st of December , then next ensuing ; and the said Company having given the like notice on the 16th of May , 1730. for the payment and discharge of the other three bonds , those also ceased to carry any further interest from and after the 31st of December then next ensuing ; and that on the 1st of Jan. 1730. and from thence continually to the 4th day of March aforesaid , there remained due and payable from the said Company , over and above the principal sums of 100 l. on each of the said bonds , no more than the sum of 96 l. for interest , on account of all the said four bonds ; and they the said Winifred Jackson , & c. did falsely , freudulently , unlawfully , and deceitfully declare , affirm , and assert to the said Thomas Sharp , that the Company , notwithstanding such publick notices , had , upon the petition of her the said Winifred Jackson , at a General Court by them holden , ordered , that the said four bonds should carry interest to the said 4th day of March ; and did likewise assert , that there was then due from the said Company , on account of the said four bonds , the full sum of 665 l. 2 s. and they did falsely and deceitfully entice the said Thomas Sharp to pay her , the said Winifred Jackson , the said sum of 665 l. 2 s. which sum he , giving credit and belief to the aforesaid declarations , & c. did then and there actually pay into the proper hands of the said Winifred , as so much money due from the said Company , on and for the purchase of the said bonds , by reason and means whereof the said Thomas Sharp did then and there pay to the said Winifred 169 l. 2 s. more than was really due ; and thereby the said Winifred Jackson , & c. did unlawfully and fraudulently obtain from , cheat and defraud the said Thomas Sharp of the sum of 169 l. 2 s. to the great deceit , fraud and demage of the said Thomas Sharp , in contempt of our said Sovereign Lord the King , and his laws , to the evil example of all others , & c. The Council for the Prosecutor having opened the case , the bonds were produced , and Mr. Webb proved them to be the East-India Company 's bonds . Mr. Christopher Mould , the Secretary to the East-India Company , produced the minutes of the proceedings of the Company , and a minute made at a General Court holden the 22d of March 1736 , was read , showing , that Winifred Jackson had petitioned , that her four bonds ( of the numbers and dates set forth in the indictment ) might be renewed , and the interest thereof to that time paid , notwithstanding the notices given by the Court of Directors in 1729 and 1730 , that the said bonds should be paid off ; and the Court 's resolution thereupon , viz . '' Resolved , that the said bonds `` be paid off , with the interest thereupon , according `` to the notices given . '' Q. Mr. Mould , Do you remember Mrs. Jackson 's applying at that time upon this account ? Mr. Mould . I remember the Lady 's applying at that time ; and it was taken notice of by every Director , she used to attend them and tease them so , from day to day , and time to time . Then the Council for the Prosecutor begged leave to call Mr. Sharp to prove what method this Lady ( Mrs. Jackson ) took to accomplish her ends in this case . Prosecutor 's Council . Mr. Sharp , you are acquainted with Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Mayers ; pray give the court an account of this affair . Mr. Sharp . I never saw Mrs. Jackson or Mrs. Mayers , till I received a letter from Mrs. Mayers , which was wrote in this manner ( I have not the letter here ) `` I desire you will call upon `` me some afternoon , I have something to propose , `` which will be for your advantage . Your `` humble Servant , J . Mayers . '' Accordingly I went to Mrs. Mayers 's , for as there was something to my advantage , I was glad to hear of it ; when I went she said , I have something to propose very much to your advantage , but when I tell you , you would think I joke : She said , she knew a lady who had no relation in the world , who came to her house every night in the week , and if you will come here to morrow night you shall see her ; she is worth forty thousand pound , and lives at one Mrs. Witham 's in Chancery-Lane ; she said she was a frugal lady , and would not spend it . I thought forty thousand pound was a great deal to lay hold of , and a good wife too , and I was to go the next night to meet her at Mrs. Mayers 's - I had several letters , but not one of them has a date ( I think this was in January or February 1741 . ) I went by appointment at five o'clock , she said she had been with Mrs. Jackson , that she was ill of a cold , and she was angry with herself she had spoke to me about it , for fear I should think she deceived me , and bid me not be uneasy , for she saw her every day , and would soon bring it to pass . Prisoners Council . Mr. Sharp , I understand there are some letters . Who wrote these letters ? Mr. Sharp . Mrs. Mayers said sometimes they were wrote by her son , and sometimes by her daughter : After these letters Mrs. Mayers would sometimes come and drink a pint of wine with me , says she , I will try , whether I can not get her leave for you to go to her house ; she has a great many East-India and South Sea bonds , and I will try whether I can not get her to part with some of the bonds she had at her brother 's death : She has petitioned the general court of the East-India Company , and they have ordered the interest to be paid to the year 1736 , they have allowed her forty eight pound : Says she , you know those gentlemen , you trade with them , you must try to get this high interest for Mrs. Jackson , and she will reckon you 2 clever fellow , and then the match will be made at once ; I said , I never bought or sold a bond in my life , and I did not care to meddle with them . Some time after she came and told me , that Mrs. Jackson said , if you will bring him , and he will talk of nothing but the bonds , he may come ; so I met Mrs. Mayers at a tavern in Chancery-Lane ( I believe this was in February ) and there was Mrs. Judith Mayers , her son and daughter ; we went to Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Mayers 's son Solomon pulled out this petition ( the petition to the East-India Company ) he said he wrote it , that he was along with Mrs. Jackson , and delivered it , and that the Company had ordered that the bonds should be paid according to the information they had given me in a paper - They all said it , the mother , the son , and the daughter , and swore to it - The petition was produced by Solomon Mayers , and so was the paper with the amount of the bonds drawn out , but not at the same time : I said these bonds have been out-standing a long time , I can not see what interest is due upon them . Q . You say he told you the bonds were to be paid according to the writing he produced . Mr. Sharp . When we were all together Mrs. Mayers appointed that Mr. Mayers should settle it with Mrs. Jackson before I was to give her the money for the bonds . Q . How could she deceive you in this when you had been apprized before of the order for paying the bonds off ? Mr. Sharp . I was not informed any otherwise than Mrs. Mayers informed me . Q . Did you come to any agreement that they came to any particular interest ? Mr. Sharp . When I desired the account in writing , he said the general court had ordered payment to be made upon the bonds according to what was in that paper - he told me they had petitioned the general court , and they all said the court had agreed that the interest should be settled to the time mentioned in that paper - they said there was forty eight pound due upon each bond down to the year 1736 , as appears by the Company 's books down to the year 1736 , and that they had allowed all the interest to that time , and there the interest is cast up . Q . Did they all agree that it should be put into writing ? Mr. Sharp . They all agreed to it , then Mrs. Jackson said , she would appoint a time for me to come and pay the money for them . Prisoners Council . Where did you go when you went from that house ? Mr. Sharp . We went back again to the tavern , Mrs. Mayers staid a little behind , and when she came she gave me a great deal of joy ; she sat down by me , and gave me a prodigious slap upon the thigh , and said , God , you are a lucky devil , for she likes you prodigiously . Q . What was the next thing ? Mr. Sharp . Mrs. Judith Mayers the next day brought this paper to my house , and said , my son has been with Mrs. Jackson all day settling the account , and this account he has brought you ; says she , Mrs. Jackson will meet you on Thursday night at the Bank coffee-house , and then you are to buy these bonds ; I said , buying of these bonds is no more than taking a bank note , for I can go to the India-house the next day and get the money again : I met her at the Bank coffee-house the 4th of March , 1741 . Q . Who were there at that time ? Mr. Sharp . All the four persons I have indicted ; I carried the paper with me - it was produced there , and Mrs. Mayers said this is the true interest due upon these bonds . Prisoners Council . Speak up boldly , Mr. Sharp , I can not hear you . Mr. Sharp . May be you do not desire to hear me . Mrs. Mayers said that was the right account : I said to Mrs. Jackson , Madam , I will give you the money for these bonds ; but look here , Mrs. Mayers and Mr. Mayers , take notice of one thing ; as for my part I can not see how Mr. Mayers can cast up the interest ; suppose the interest should happen to be more or less , if there is any mistake we must rectify it , and give or take the difference ; and they all agreed to this . Prisoners Council . How is this a fraud then ? Another Council . Out of your own mouth comes the truth . Sharp . I shall not deny this I say so still , and they all said , Aye , to be sure , the difference was to be settled : Mrs. Mayers came to my house , and said , Do n't part with the bonds ; I would have you keep them , for Mrs Jackson is as cunning a woman as any in the world ; for she will come and look upon the bonds , to see if you can spare the money out of trade ; and I believe I should not have gone about the money for the bonds , if Mrs. Mayers had not said that ; I went on the Tuesday to Mr. Webb , at the India-House , and told him , I had got some East-India bonds ; he looked at them , says he , Who had you these bonds of ? Said I , What signifies who I had them of ; he looked at them again , God bless me ! says he , you had these bonds of Mrs. Jackson ; I told him , I had , and shewed him the paper , with the account of the interest ; he looked upon it , said he , Go back again to her , as fast as you can , for she has cheated you ; I went several times , and could not see her ; I went one day , and desired to see Mrs. Witham , and told her the affair , and she owned Mrs. Jackson had ordered herself to be denied ; I brought an action and recovered the money ; and what I do now is for the good of the publick ; I have been 40 l. out of pocket already . Q. to Mr. Webb . Suppose Mr. Sharp had come to you and told you of such a petition , could not you have informed him whether it had beenplied with ? Mr. Webb . Yes , to be sure , if he had shewed me the bonds . Q . Could not you have told by the numbers ? Mr. Webb . No . I could not , but if I had any acquaintance with the person , I would have endeavoured to have informed him , as well as I could . Prisoners Council to Mr. Sharp . Had not yo the petition a month before you paid the money for the bonds ? Mr. Sharp . I had not the petition till I paid for the bonds ; the petition was only read to me at Mrs. Jackson 's , and it was only read to me when they brought the account of the interest . The petition to the honourable the Directors of the East-India Company was produced and read , and likewise the paper wherein they had cast up the principal and interest , with the particulars of the interest ( said there to be as it stands on the Company 's books ) the total amounting to 665 l. 2 s. Emanuel Mayers . I believe it was this February was two years , that Mr. Sharp was with Mrs. Jackson at our house , and Madam Jackson asked him , whether he had enquired about those bonds ; he said , he had not enquired , for he had not proper instructions - He said , he would give her the money for the bonds , if she would give it him in writing , that if he could not get all the money of the Company , that she would return it ; which she agreed to , and then she said , she would give him a copy of the petition to enquire by - They did not tell him whether the petition was presented , or no - My brother wrote out the petition , and I and my sister carried it about a month before March the 4th . My brother told him , Sir , if you think you ca n't get the money , do n't take the bonds at all - I did not hear Mr. Sharp say any thing to it ; and my brother wrote out the account ; he took me with him to Mrs. Jackson 's , and she told him how to write it , and my sister and I carried the account to Mr. Sharp , and said I had brought the account by Madam Jackson 's order ; and he said , tell Mrs. Jackson I will meet her at the Bank coffee-house , and I will pay her the money for the bonds ; I know how to get the money of the Company , I know how to make the Company pay me - I heard him say these words ; the money was paid the fourth of March . Prisoners Council . Do you remember at any time that he made any proposal of stifling the prosecution ? Mayers . He desired my mother and sister would go out of town , and not appear at the trial , and he would pay the charges ; and she said , she would not ; he said , then it should be the worse for her . Council . This was when he sued Mrs. Jackson ; but do you remember , that Mr. Sharp said at any time , he would have some money of Mrs. Jackson , or he would bring her to the bar ? Mayers . Last December , or thereabouts , he said he was going to find a bill of indictment against Mrs. Jackson , and wanted my mother , brother , and sister , to go to the Old-Bailey , and he said , he would make them handsom presents , but they would not ; then he said , he would indict them all out of spite ; he said , he would carry my brother off swearing , he would spoil all their swearing ; my mother said , it was a vile thing to prefer an indictment , and so he went away in a passion . Mr. Sharp . That boy never was at any of the meetings . Mrs. Witham . Mr. Sharp came to speak to Mrs. Jackson ; I heard some high words , there was a mighty hurley burley , and Mr. Sharp said , I will send you all to Newgate . What , said I , I that know nothing at all of the matter ? he said , Not you . I said , how came you to buy these bonds , when you bought them with your eyes open ? he said , if it had been a thousand pound he would have done it for her - I believe all the county of Essex will give Mrs. Jackson a good character ; her father was a man of good reputation , and so were all the family - I believe she is worth a good thousand a year , and a coach and four horses , near Brentwood . Mary King . When Mrs. Jackson was in custody of Mr. Carter the Tipstaff , Mr. Sharp was there , and he said to her , he would send Mrs. Mayers to keep her company ; he said , he would have sent them , but they were worth nothing ; but , Madam , you shall fine . Mr. Sharp . I never said any such thing in my life . King . You did say so , and Mrs. Jackson made answer , and said , You would hang me if you could ; and you said , Aye that I would , for I have already agreed with a surgeon for your body to be made a skeleton of ; and when I have so done , you shall be put in a closet in my room , that when I have a mind to see Mrs. Jackson , I may go up and look at her . Mr. William Carter . I am the tipstaff that took Mrs. Jackson up , and in conversation between Mr. Sharp and her , he was angry with her , and said , she had cheated him of a great deal of money , and he would send Mrs. Mayers to her . - He said , if he discharged her now , intimating . he had it in his power to discharge her or not , and that , if she would marry him , he would release her ; those were not the very words , but to that purport . Mrs. Alcorn . I am a tenant to Mrs. Jackson , by the Exchange ; I do not think she would defraud any person of a farthing . Mr. Solomon Riatti . I have heard Mr. Sharp say , that Mrs. Jackson had made application to the East-India Company about her bonds . Q . Did he at any time before he paid her the money for the bonds , tell you , the petition was rejected ? Riatti . No , he never did . Mr. Sisson and Mr. Gibson have known Mrs. Jackson a great many years , and gave her the character of a very honest woman . Mr. Sandford was called by the Prosecutor , and being asked Mrs. Jackson 's character , he said , he never heard any harm of her . It being proved , that , before the payment of the money for the bonds , there was an agreement made between the parties , that if it should happen , there was any mistake in the casting up of the interest , it was to be rectified ; if it did not come to so much as the computation . Mrs. Jackson was to return the surplus ; if it came to more , Mr. Sharp was to pay her . Whereupon , Winifred Jackson , and Judith Mayers , were acquitted . Solomon Mayers , and Mary Mayers , the two others in the indictment , did not surrender themselves . 169. Charles Gray , late of St. James 's Westminster , Grocer , was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury , in his oath before the Justices at the Sessions of the Peace , holden at Guild-Hall , for the City of London , on Wednesday the 5th of December last , in order to entitle himself to his discharge , by the late Act of Parliament , for the relief of insolvent debtors , viz . That he , Charles Gray , was at Calais in France , beyond the seas , on the first day of January , 1742 , and did not return from thence to England till between the 15th and 20th days of the said month of January . Whereas , in truth , and in fact , the said Charles Gray was not at Calois in France , or elsewhere beyond the seas , on the said first day of January , 1742 . But the Prosecutor not producing the Gazette , in which he advertised himself , that he intended to take the benefit of the act , he was acquitted . 170.
