See summary . ] Jane Holmes , alias Barret , alias Frazier , was indicted for privately stealing 20 Yards of Straw Ground Brocaded Silk , value 10 l. the Goods of John Moone , and Richard Stone , in their Shop , June 1 . The Fact appear 'd thus . The Silk was lost from the Shop of Messieurs Moore and Stone , the Queens Head and Anchor on Ludgate-hill , on the 4 or 5 of November last . Not long after which the Prisoner , and another Woman or two , went into a Mercers Shop , the backside of St. Clements , to cheapen some Goods , and soon after they were gone , a Piece of Silk was missing . These Women , and others of their Profession , had been often at Several Shops in that Neighbourhood , so that they were pretty well known . He acquainted several Shopkeepers thereabouts with his loss , and it was not long before one of them saw the Prisoner , and one of the Woman aforesaid , as they were making another Tour ; He gave the Mercer notice , who traced them to the House of - Johnson a Victualler , at the Thistle and Crown , in Denmark Court . Where he searched for his Goods to no purpose , but he found the Brocaded Silk in the Indictment , which was made into a Gown , and Lin 'd with a Pink colour 'd Mantua . The Prisoner own 'd the Gown to be hers , and said that she bought it of the Maker , at the George Ale-house by Stocks Market , ( a House frequented by Weavers , ) but her Husband being a Journey-man Shooe-maker , he thought such a Gown was too fine for her , and therefore threatned to burn it , to prevent which , she had persuaded Johnson to let it lye at his House . Several Mercers were sent for , to see if they knew the Silk , Mr. Moone was one of that number , and found the Brocade to be his . The Prisoner thus made her Defence . I have been a Holland Trader for Several Years , and having a large Acquaintance , Moll Burton , ( who was Jonathan Wilds Maid , ) brought me this Brocade to sell for her . - I shew 'd it to some , who did not like the Figure of it , and by accident a Mug of Drink was Spilt upon it , by which it was very much damaged , so that it was thrown upon my Hands , and I was forced to pawn my Goods to pay for it . Mary Burton , alias Ravenscroft , alias Fenton , alias Holloway , alias Hafield , thus depos 'd . I never saw that Brocade , till it was shewn me by Mr. Moone , at an Ale-house in Covent Garden , after he had taken it from Mr. Johnson 's House , and the Prisoner told me , that she her self spoke with it , ( i.e . Stole it . ) Guilty Death . Jane Holmes , was a 2d time indicted for privately stealing 40 Yards of Pink Colour 'd Mantua , value 10 l. in the Shop of Matth.ew Herbert , May 1 . Thomas Coleman thus depos 'd . I live with Mr. Herbert , I remember the missing of a Piece of Pink Mantua , and believe , that this Lining to the Brocade is a part of it , for was we make our own Goods ; We make them , as this is , a little broader than usual . Mary Barton thus depos 'd . The Prisoner came to my Lodging in Black Fryers , between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , told me that she had seen something very good , and desir 'd me to go out with her . We went to Mr.Herbert 's Shop , I cheapen 'd some Straw colour 'd Mantua for an Apron , for which they asked 3 s. and 2 d. a Yard , and I offer 'd them 2 s. and 10 d. In the mean time the Prisoner took a Piece of Pink Mantua , and we went away undiscover 'd . We measur 'd it at her Lodging , and found there was 42 Yards , which we equally divided . She bade me 3 s. for my half , but I told her I could have more for it , she said she 'd line her Gown with part of her own half , and I believe this Lining to be the same . - I afterwards sold my half to Ann Green , who is not yet taken . Guilty , Katherine Fitzpatrick , alias Green , alias Boswell , was indicted for privately stealing 19 Yards of Green Damask , value 9 l. the Goods of Joseph Gifford , and John Ravenell , in their Shop , July 29 . 1724 .

Mary Burton thus depos 'd . - The Prisoner call 'd me out . - We went to Mr. Giffords Shop , and ask 'd for red Damask . While one of the Men were shewing us Goods , the other went backwards to fetch more Pieces , and left open a Drawer , that was drawn from under the Counter . The Prisoner took a Piece of Green Damask from thence , and put it into her Petticoat , which was pinn 'd up . - When we came home , she gave it to Theodosia Kirk to pawn . Theodosia Kirk thus depos 'd . The Prisoner sent for me , desir 'd me to pawn a Piece of Green Damask , and said that she had it of her Cousin Madam Cately , who was the Widow of a Mercer that broke . I pawn 'd it to Mr. Martin in Black Fryers , who lent me 6 Guineas on it , at 3 d. in the Pound for a Month . The Prisoner said nothing in her Defence , but that she had the Silk of Moll . Burton . Guilty Death . Katherine Fitzpatrick , was a 2d . time indicted for privately stealing 10 Yards of Green Sat tin , value 3 l. the Goods of John Moone , and Richard Stone , in their Shop , February 10 . 1724-5 . Mr. Stone thus depos 'd . Two Women came to the Shop , and ask 'd for Black and White Three Quarter Mantua . They said they came from Reading , and I knowing several in that Town , it occasion 'd a pretty deal of Discourse , and while we were talking , my Prentice came in with a Piece of Green Sattin in a Wrapper , which I had sent him for , to my Lady Withringtons , where I had left it the Day before . - When the Women were gone , I ask 'd him where he had put the Sattin , he said he laid it on the Counter ; - We search 'd for it , but could find nothing but the Wrapper . Mary Burton thus depos 'd . The Prisoner and I went to the Prosecutors Shop and desir 'd to see some Ash colour 'd Silk ; We had some talk about Reading . The Boy brought in a Piece of Green Sattin in a Wrapper , and laid it on the Counter . The Prisoner took it out of the Wrapper , and carry 'd it off . I then lived in Fleet-lane , where I often saw the Prosecutors Boy , come to fetch a Horse , and I told the Prisoner , I was afraid the Boy would know me again , and did intend to change my Lodging . - She carried the Silk to Kirk , who pawn 'd it to Martins Wife for 40 s. The Apprentice depos 'd . That he brought home the Green Sattin in a Wrapper ; and laid it on the Counter , while 2 Women were in the Shop . - That it was mist when they were gone , and that he used to go to a Horse in Fleet-Lane .

Mrs. Hutt thus depos 'd . I keep an Upholster 's Shop in St. Pauls Church-Yard . Two Women in Riding Hoods came in , and ask 'd for Blankets . - Mary Burton follow 'd them , and she being very like a Neighbours Neice , I mistook her for the same , and to had no Suspicion . - I ask 'd if the Blankets were for her Aunt , and she said yes . A Piece of Green Mantua had been brought home that Day , and being in haste to use about 10 Yards of it for a Bed , before the Weaver came to see it measured , I cut off what I wanted , but left a narrow Edge on one side , with the Ticket to it , - and then put it in the Window , and mist it soon after they were gone . Mary Burton thus depos 'd , The 2 Prisoners came to my Room , and ask 'd me to go out , which in our way of Speaking signifies to go a Shoplifting . I was not drest , and so they told me where they intended to go , and that they would wait for me , at a Brandy Shop in St. Pauls Church-Yard . They went , I drest my self and follow 'd them , but before I came to the Brandy Shop . I saw them in the Prosecutors Shop , and went into them ; The Gentlewoman of the Shop , said something to me about my Aunt . Fitzpatrick took the Silk out of the Window , and put it under her Hood , but there was a long Edging to it , cut in little Escallops , that had like to have betray 'd us . She sold it for 3 s. 6 d. a Yard , but Sarah Turner was angry with her , and said , she could have got 4 s. for it . Mr. Moone thus depos 'd . When Turner was first taken up , I advis 'd her to make herself an Evidence , but she would not then be persuaded . She afterwards escaped from the Officer ; I saw her again in the Gate-house after she was re-taken , and then she cry 'd and confest that she was guilty of this Fact , and beg 'd that I would get her to be transported , and wish 'd that she had taken my Advice , but then it was too late , for upon his Majesties Promise of Pardon , and a Reward of 50 l. publish 'd in the Gazette , Mary Burton had voluntarily surrendred herself to be an Evidence .

Several of the Shoplifters were brought before me to be examin 'd . Holms would fain have been an Evidence , and named I believe near 40 Robberies , that she had been concern 'd in , but she having been transported , I could not admit her . Then Turner offer 'd to become an Evidence , and confest that she had committed several Felonies in Company with Fitzpatrick . I asked her if she had ever been in Newgate . No , says she , but I was one Night indeed a walking in Fleet-street with a Girl ( Molly Grainge ) and a Gentleman pick 'd us up , and carried us to the Tavern , and she pick 'd his Pocket , and was hang 'd for it . At last Mary Burton came in a voluntary Evidence , and the Information that she then gave me , agrees in every particular with what she now swears in Court .

Upon which I open 'd the Money Drawer in the Shop , and taking out a Bag in which was two Bank Notes for 50 l. and above 10 l. in Money . I paid him and put the Bag up again . The Prisoner who was a Ticket Porter , and plying thereabouts , was then standing at the Window , and saw the Mony .

Why ar'n't you an Impudent Boldface now , says I , pray what Business have you to meddle with the Drawer , Why ye old Bitch , says he , what 's that to you , I 'll meddle with what I please , and then he began to pull and haul , and touzle me about at such a Rate , that you 'd ' a blest your self , and he would fain ' a ' had me ' a ' gone into the Cellar to lye with me ; and in short he grew so rude and obstropolus , that I was forc 'd to run out of the Shop , or else I had certainly been ravisht , and that would have been a sad thing in my old Age , for alackaday I have liv 'd these Threescore and Fourteen Years in the World , and was never ravish 'd in my Life , so that what became of the Money when I was gone , I can not tell . Margaret Laurance thus depos 'd . About 4 in the Afternoon , I saw the Prisoner teizing the old Beggar Woman , and she call 'd him Thieving Dog , and told him he had no Business there . The Prisoner thus made his Defence . I know nothing of the Money , but as for the old Beggar Woman , I was minded to have a little Fun with her , because I have heard say , That if you take an old Woman and bite her by the Ear , she 'll serve as well as a young Girl . Some Witnesses gave the Prisoner a good Character , and farther depos 'd that Mademan and his Wife were first charged with this Felony , and that she had lately been sent to Bridewel for stealing a Candlestick .

Alexander Watts thus depos 'd . I was got drunk , and was going home to Cats Hole in St. Catherines . In my Wastecoat Pocket I had got a pound of Hair in a Bladder , and a Pocket Book , a Pair of Gloves , and a Handkerchief in the other Pocket ; and so coming under Aldgate , I saw the Prisoner Isabel Lucky before me , and I gave her a Tap upon the Shoulder , and ask 'd her where she was going , and she said a little farther , and so she walked sometimes before me , and sometimes behind , till she came to Goodman's-Yard , and there she turned down , and went into a Porch , and I after her . Well , says she , what will you give me now . Why indeed my Dear , says I again , I have got no Money at present , but if you 'll oblige me so and so , I 'll make ye Amends the next Time I see ye , for I live but a little Way off . Truly , says she , I can do nothing without ready Money , for I ca n't afford to trust . - Indeed my Dear you must for this once . - Will you be as good as your Word then ? - Yes indeed I will Child . - Well then if I must , I must , and so , Sir , I laid her upon the Ground , for she was not afraid of daubing her Cloths , because she was then in as dirty a Pickle as she is in now . But however as foul as she was , I ca n't deny but that I did commit that filthy Sin upon her , and just in the Heat of Action , she cry 'd out , The Watch , the Watch is a coming , get away and shift for your self . So I got off , and turn 'd my Back upon her , and put up my Breeches , but the Watch not coming , I went to the Porch and felt for her there , but she was gone ; then I felt in my Pockets , and found that all was lost . Well , says I , to my self , The Bitch had robb 'd me , she has taken away every Thing that I had about me ; my very Hair and Bladder and all , and I am an undone Man !

She was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroners Inquisition for the said Murder . Mr. Disney thus depos 'd . On Saturday the 13th of August , I was sent for to visit the Deceas 'd . He was lying upon his Bed , and complaining of a Cold that he got by crossing the Water , in his Return from Dr. Lloyd 's Feast , that he had had a Pain in his Head , Back , and Limbs , and had since been taken with a Purging two or three Times a Day , which had partly remov 'd his Pains . I advis 'd him to Rhubarh to take off the Purging ; and on Monday following I saw him again , and he was them pretty easy , and she Purging gone . - He sent for me again about 10 the same Night , and ask 'd me if he might venture to go to Knights-Bridge next Morning , I advis 'd him to stay a little longer , for I found him in a breathing Sweat , and a declining Feaver , which I thought would prove intermiring . I administred a proper Draught , and he was easier next Day , being Tuesday ; but about 4 in the Afternoon his Feaver return 'd , which left him in a breathing Sweat as before . About 10 at Night his Servant came to me , with a Vial of Liquid , which he said was sent to his Master by Mr. Godfrey , the Chymist , with Orders to take about half a Pint at Night , and as much in the Morning . I took it to be an Emulsion made with Orange-Flower Water , & c. and told the Servant that if Mr. Godfrey sent it , his Master might take it safely . - I went to visit the Deceas 'd next Morning , and understood that he had taken thrice of that Emulsion , about a quarter of a Pint each Time . I found him very faint , and he told me that he had above 40Sou the preceeding Night , and was extreamly grip 'd and crampt . I went to Mr. Ambrose Godfrey to know what it was that he had sent to the Deceas 'd , Mr. Godfrey appear 'd very much surpriz 'd , and assur 'd me that he had not sent any Thing . - I gave the Deceas 'd Rhubarb , Diascordium , and a Cordial I Draught , he sometimes grew worse , and sometimes mended a little , till the Sunday following , and then he voided Blood , and dyed on the succeeding Wednesday Morning . I saw him when he was open 'd . I could discover no Symptom of Poison in his Stomach , it was indeed a little enflamed , but no more than what commonly happens from a violent Dysentery or Diarrhaea . The Guts were lined with Blood , I did not observe an Excoriation , for I did not see the Blood taken out ; But However that Emulsion , might possibly be the cause of his Death , for though I am satisfied that there was nothing Poisonous put into it , yet there might be something which might throw him into that violent Laxity . Mr. Belcher the Apothecary thus depos 'd . I open 'd the Stomach of the Deceas 'd , and found no Inflamation till I came to the Duodenum , which was a little enflam 'd . The great Guts were fill 'd with Blood and Excrement , and bylous Juices , as is usual in Dysentries which ensue Diarrheas . I saw not the least Sympton of Poison , and verily believe that he dy 'd a natural Death ; I tasted some of the Emulsion that was left , it was grown a little Acid with keeping . I could not discover , that there was any thing Poisonous , or Hurtful , but I took it to be a Cooling Innocent Draught , made of Almonds , Barly-water , Orange Flower-water , Sugar , and some other harmless Ingredients . - I advis 'd them to make some tryal of its Effect , upon a Puppy , or a Kitling , but they said , there was not enough left , to make the Experiment . - I can not think that it was the Cause of the Deceaseds Death . Mr. Godfrey the Chymist depos 'd . That he knew nothing of sending that Emulsion to the Deceas 'd , but he had try 'd several Chymical Experiments upon what was left of it , and could not find , that it was in the least Poisonous , Purgative , or any way Hurtfull . Dr. Hollings depos 'd . That he believ 'd the Potion was not Poisonous , and it might be a natural violent Looseness , that put an End to the Life of the Deceas 'd . Mrs. Smith thus depos 'd . I live at the Bedford Coffee-House , on Monday Evening , the Prisoner with an elderly Gentlewoman and a Girl , came thither . and had a Pint of Attack made into Punch , after which , they desir 'd something Cool , I brought her a Drink , which we call Oziat , which they drank , and the Prisoner liked it so well , that she took a Pint away with her , for which she paid a Shilling . Mary Jarret the Prisoners Cook maid thus depos 'd . On Tuesday Night , as I was sitting by the Fire , my Mistress call 'd me to her , and said , Mary , I 'll trust no body but you , I was last Night at the Bedford Coffee house , where I drank some pleasant Cool Liquor , and I brought this Pint home with me . Mr. Shovat at next Door . is ill of a Feaver , and I believe it will do him good , and therefore I 'd have you carry it to him , - hold the Bottle by the Neck , that your Hands may heat it , as little as possible . - I was going with it , when bethinking my self , Pray Madam says I , if they should ask who sent it , what shall I say - Why tell them says my Mistress , that you brought it from Mr. Godfrey , and that Mr. Shovat must drink half a Pint to Night , and the rest in the Morning . So I carried it , and the next Day Mr. Godfrey came to our House very angry , and asked who it was , that carried any thing in his Name , to Mr. Shovat 's , I told him that I had , and ( as my Mistress had Instructed me ; ) that I had it from a Gentleman in Black , who came to our House , and whom I have seen several times is Mr. Shovats Company , Mr. Godfrey was in a great Pasion ; and said that such a thing was enough to ruin his Credit , for Mr. Shovat was dangerously ill after it . He threatn 'd me hard , and had me before a Justice , to make me discover who the Gentleman in black was , my Master Bail 'd me . The Deceas 'd grew worse , I was sadly frighten 'd , and my Mistress appear 'd very much concern 'd , who would have thought , says she , that that Innocent Emulsion , should have done the poor Gentleman any hurt . But do n't you be afraid , you can come to no harm , and I beg of you , not to tell who you had it of , for if it should be known , I shall be ruin 'd , and that 's what my Neighbours want . Now I knew as how that some of the Neighbours had been saying , as if my Master had been Jealous of Mr. Shovat , and therefore thought , if I told that my Mistress had sent him any thing , it might make them talk but the more , and bring her into a great deal of trouble , and so when I was carried before the Justice again , I still stood it out , that a Gentleman in black gave the Bottle ; I was sent to the Round-house . Mr. Shovat dy 'd , and at last it all came out . - I never knew that there had ever been a Quarrel , or Malice between the Deceas 'd , and my mistress , he frequented our House , till the Day that he was taken ill. Thomas Hanford the Deceas 'd Servant thus depos 'd . The Prisoner 's maid brought the Emulsion , told me that it came from Mr. Godfrey , and that he order 'd her , to see it carry 'd up to my Master , but she being in haste , she went away before my Mistress came down . Mrs. Shovat thus depos 'd - I had been Married to the Deceas 'd , about 10 Months . - I was call 'd down to receive this Emulsion , which my Man told me , was left by Mr. Sherman 's Cook . I sent for her , she told me it was given her , by a tall Man in black , who order 'd her to say , it came from Mr. Godfrey ; I ask 'd her if Mr. Godfrey knew Mr. Shovat had a Feavor , she said yes , I ask 'd if there was no strong Waters in it , she said it was an innocent Cool thing , and I might taste if I pleas 'd . - I told her I had . She went away ; I came in to my Husband , who being willing to have Mr. Disneys Opinion of it , he sent it to him . - Mr. Disney sent word , that he believ 'd it was innocent , and if it came from Mr. Godfrey , he might venture to take it . So I set it by the Bed-side , and at three several times , I gave my Spouse a Quarter of a Pint of it - He was taken very ill about ; in the Morning , he had a violent purging , the Gripes , Cramps , and Fainting Fits , and so he continued till Saturday , and then he voided several Ounces of Blood , and dy 'd the Wednesday Morning following . The Prisoner thus made her Defence . I acknowledge that I sent that Liquor to the Deceas 'd , but as I had drank of it my self , and found it very harmeless , Cooling , and Pleasant , I thought it might do good , or at least no hurt to the Deceas 'd in his illness , to whom I bore a respect as he was a Neighbour , a Customer , and a very Civil Gentleman . His free and familiar Carriage , had indeed created some uneasiness in my Husband , and from thence a few spitefull Neighbours , had taken occasion to be very liberal of their Censures , and therefore I was Cautious , in sending him that small present . Mr. Shaw the Surgeon thus depos 'd . I open 'd the Deceas 'd Body , the Day after his Death , and found not the least Symptom of Poison , nor any thing but what is common , and the natural Effect of Diarrhea and Dysentries . I have seen many in the like Case . - I drank half a mouthfull of the Emulsion that was left , and it did me no hurt , and I would have drank it all if desir 'd , for I have frequently drank the same sort at the Coffee-house , and can depend upon my taste , that there was nothing mixt with it ; Half a Pint of small Beer , or any other cool Liquid , would have had the same Effect , in the like distemper . The Jury Acquitted her . Samuel Vevers was indicted for Assaulting Benjamin Wyersdell on the Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him 19 s. August 24 . Benjamen Wyersdale thus depos 'd . I , my Wife , and a Kinswoman , having been at my Lord Castlemains Gardens , we were returning home in a Hackney Coach . It was a bright Moon light Night , and about Nine o'Clock when we came upon Cambridge-Heath , ( between Bethnal Green and Hackney Road . ) and there a Man upon a black Horse ( or Mare ) rode up to the Coachman , and holding out a Pistol , cry 'd Stand ! G - D - ye Stand ! or I 'll Shoot ye through the Head . My Wife sat facing the Horses , and I on the other side . The Man came up to me , and Claping a Pistol to my Breast , he said , D - ye deliver . I desir 'd him to be Civil , and he should have my Money . Come , Come , G - D - ye says he deliver immediately . I gave him about a 11 s. and some Halfpence . G - D - ye says he , wheres your Gold , and your Watch , I told him I had none , Why then by G - I 'll kill ye says he . I assure ye Sir says I , that I have given you all , and therefore I beg you would not use me ill. - My Wife then gave me 6 or 8 s. more , I gave it to him , he still cry 'd , D - ye whereas your Gold ! your Gold ! I must have it . I again told him that I had none upon which he turn 'd about Cock 'd his Pistol , clapt it to my Breast , Swore he 'd Shoot me , and then pull 'd the Triger . The Flint struck Fire , but I believe the priming was blown away , so that it did not go off . Then he let the Coach pass , and we thought he was gone , but he quickly came up again and searched my Fob , he was going round to the other side of the Coach , and had like to have fallen in a Ditch , but recovering himself , he rode off towards Bednall Green , and we drove homeward , Shoreditch way . I believe the Prisoner to be the Man , I can not Swear positively , though I did think then , that I had seen such a Face before , but could not remember where - When I came home , I was talking of my loss , and described the Man : and Horse as exactly as I could , and several people said , that it must be the Prisoner who was a Bricklayer , and liv 'd not far from the Black Day , in Shoreditch , and keeps his Mare in a Stable near my House . I have since seen that Mare , and believe her to be the same . Mary Wyersdale thus depos 'd . I am positive that the Prisoner is the Man , that rob 'd my Husband . I had some knowledge of him before , and I told my Husband so that next day , - and when he was carried before the Justice , I knew him again , both by his voice and Face ; I am so certain that he is the very Man , that I was never more fully satisfied of any thing in my Life . - I remember when my Husband told him that he had no Watch not Ring 's he answer 'd , as if he know him , What ! Such a Man as you , go abroad without Watch or Rings ? William Stout the Coachman . Confirm 'd Mr. Wyersdells Evidence , and thus added . The Man was tall and thin , in a dark brown Coat , and a light Wig . He rode upon a black Beast with a white Bridle ; I could not exactly observe his Face , because his Back was mostly towards me - On the Friday following , I went to see the Mare and the Prisoner , and do really believe that the Mare is the same , but I am not quite so certain as to the Man . However I had some talk with him , and he told me at first , that his Mare had not been out of the Stable , that Evening the Robbery was Committed , but afterwards he said , that his boy had taken her out to Water . Mr. Wyersdale again depos 'd . That when the Prisoners boy was Examin 'd about the Mare , he said that he rode her to Bartholomew Fair , and return 'd about 7 at Night . Most of this Deposition was corroberuted by George English , who sat upon the Coach-box with this Witness . The Prisoner in his Defence , call 'd several Witnesses to prove , that he was at another Place , when the Robbery was committed , who thus depos 'd . Mr. Pitman din 'd with the Prisoner , after which they went together through Swan Fields , where the Prisoner had some work to do . There he found his Boy , and ( it being Bartholomew Day ) gave him half a Holiday , and order 'd him to ride his Mare out to water in the Evening . - From thence they two went to Mrs. Barnets at Jeremy 's Ferry , she owing the Prisoner some Money for work , and paid him 5 Guineas , he gave her a Receipt which was produced in Court . They staid drinking there till after 7 in the Evening . and then came away together . They were overtaken near the Shoulder of Mutton , by Mr Herbert a Bricklayer , who went with them to the Salmon and Ball , and call 'd for a Pint of Wine , it was then about half an hour past 8 . They had not sat long before a Hackney Coach came by , and the Coachman told somebody at the Door , that the Coach had been rob 'd , by a Highwayman upon Cambridge heath , ( which was but a little way from thence , ) about 9 a Clock , they all three went to the Prisoner 's Door , where Mr. Herbert left them , but Pitman kept him Company till a 11 a Clock , and he was sure , that the Prisoner was not upon any Horse or Mare that Night . The Coachman depos 'd , that he call 'd at the Salmon and Ball Door , and told somebody that the Coach had been rob 'd upon Cambridge-heath . And the Prisoners Boy depos 'd . That between 6 and 7 a Clock in the Evening , he rode the Mare out to water upon Cambridge heath and return 'd at 7 or a little after , and lockt the Mare up in the Stable , and he was sure she was out no more that Night .

It thus appear 'd , Leuneve had Arrested the Deceas 'd , who making some resistance , the other beat him violently , and call 'd the Prisoners ( who were likewise Bailiff s ) to his aid . They at last carry 'd him in a dismal bloody condition , to Mr. Cross 's House in Southwark , at whose Suit he was Arrested , for a Debt which originally was no more then two Pence half-penny , but now with the Charges , amounted to 24 Shillings , which was discharged by a Friend of his . When the Deceas 'd came home , he complain 'd to his Wife , that Leneve had bruis 'd and lick 'd him on the privy Parts , so that he should never be his own Man again . A Feaver succeeded , and he dy 'd in about a Fortnight . The searchers that view 'd his Body the next Day , depos 'd , that he was very much bruised , that the Blood worked out at his Nose and Mouth in an unusual Manner , and that his Privities were swell 'd as big as their 3 Fists , and turn 'd as black as a Hat . Mr Thomson the Surgeon thus depos 'd . I opened the Deceas'ds Body 4 Days after his Death , he was then bloated and all over black and blue , and the Grissel of his Nose broke , but I could not perceive any violent means of his Death .

They were a 2d , time indicted for a Misdemeanor , in Assaulting with an intent to Ravish the said Mary Haddon . Mary Haddon thus depos 'd About 4 or 5 in the Afternoon , I went from my Lodgings at the End of Swallow-Street to Totenham Court Fair , with my Mistress and her Children ; and while I was standing to hear a blind Fidler play , I lost my Company , and in the Evening up comes the two Prisoners , who were both Coachmen , and asked me if I 'd have a Coach , which I at last agreed to . Then Jessup got upon the Coach-Box , and Yates put me into the Coach , and came in after me , and pull 'd up the Windows . Jessup drove on , and I was sadly frighted , but knew not how to help my self , for Yates turn 'd up my Peticoats , and lean 'd his Breast so hard against my Mouth that I could not cry out ; then he took hold of my Legs , and put them about his Middle , and by main Force lay with me , and had the carnal Knowledge of my Body , without my Consent . And so when he had done he went out , but I was in such a Condition , that what with the Fright , and what with having my Mouth stopt , and what with striving and strugling , I was quite spent , and out of my Senses , and ready to die away ; and before I could recover my self , I found the other Prisoner , Jessup , was got into the Coach with me ; how he came in , I do n't know , but he ravish 'd me as the other had done before , but at last , when all was over , I got Breath enough to cry out Murder , and then he turn 'd me out of the Coach into the middle of the Road . They had used me so barbarously , that I was forc 'd to call at a House by the Way , and could not get home till near 11 a Clock . My Husband saw that I was very much out of Order , he asked me where I had been , and what Company I had kept till that time of Night . I not telling him at first , he began to rave and curse like a Madman , and swore that he 'd never lie with me again , if I did not satisfy him , and so at last I told him all , and besides I was afraid that they had given me the Clap . Ann Delavot , a Midwife ; thus depos 'd . I searched Mary Hadden the next Day , and found that there had been force used with her , but whether it was done by her Husband or any other Person , is more than I can tell . Other Witnesses depos 'd , that Mary Hadden had told them how she had been serv 'd , and that she had been very ill ever since . The Prisoner Yates thus made his Defence . The Prosecutors Wife was my old Acquaintance , I have Lain with her many and many a good Time . - About 7 in the Evening , as I and Jessup were talking , we saw her in the Fair standing with another Man . How do ye Molly , says I , and how d 'ye do Jerry says she . Now I was then out of Business , the Coach belonged to Jessup , and he had made several Turns from St. Giles 's Pound , and so he asked me to go and drink , which I agreed to , and Molly left the other Man and went along with us . When we came from the Alehouse she would not go into the Coach , except I went in with her which I did . And she was well enough pleas 'd with what past , for if any thing had troubled her she might have made Noise enough , and there were People enow in the Road agoing from the Fair - I have lain with her a whole Week together , at the King's-Arms in St. Martin 's lane , for I was got upon the Loose then , and it cost me 7 half Crowns in Expences . - We have bedded together twenty and twenty Times in a Hayloft . John Longfield thus depos 'd . About a Year and an half ago , I was in Company with Yates and Mary Haddon , at the Kings Head in New Bond street , and from thence we went to his Mothers , but she told him , he should bring none of his Whores there , and so she would not let him in . It was a bitter cold Night , and at last I bethought my self , and carried them into our Hayloft . He and she lay at one end , and I at the other . - I heard her bid him lye close and keep her warm , and desir 'd him not to let me have any thing to say to her , but for all that , when he had pleas 'd his Fancy , he fell asleep , and then I crept softly to her , and found she was willing that I should keep her warm too , for in short I did the same as he had done with her before . - I met him and her about a Year afterwards , and then she told him she could not do with him as before , for now she was married . Peter Nichols depos 'd , that half a Year ago , Yates and she lay together in his Hayloft . Richard Teeling thus depos 'd . The Monday after the Prisoners were apprehended , Mary Hadden was sitting upon a Bench in Piccadlly , and asked me to drink . - She told me that Yates did what he pleas 'd with her , and she should never have concern 'd herself about it , if he had not sent another Man . James Nugent depos 'd that he saw Yates put Mary Hadden into the Coach , and then go in himself , and she seem 'd very well pleas 'd with it .

For I had put'em in the Crown-Office , and sworn the Peace against them for threatening my Death and they had sworn Treason against me for cursing the King ; and therefore being afraid they would do me a Mischief , I went into the Bell-Inn , and told the People there was , 2 Rogues laid in wait for me . I staid about an Hour , and then the Ostler went with me as far as Old Street . I told him he might go back then for I believ 'd I was pretty safe , but I had not gone far before they set upon me , took away my Hat , and Wig , and 40 s.
