He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the same ; to both which Indictments he pleaded Not guilty : Richard Elms , Son of the Deceased depos 'd , That on Monday the 16th of May , between 11 and 12 at Night , he , with his Father was going home , when over against Suffolk-street they met with Mr. Clifton ; who gave them very ill Language , which his Father could not take ; upon which they immediately fell to Blows , his Father saying , he could use a Cane as well as Mr. Clifton could use a Sword : But this Deponent being kept back by the coming of other People , he was not an Eye-witness to the unhappy Accident , and though he heard his Father say he was wounded , he did not see any Pass that was made with Mr. Clifton 's Sword . This Deponent being asked , if he was certain his Father did not Strike Mr. Clifton when he endeavoured to pass by him ? Said , he could not tell ; being asked , Whether his Father did not thrust Mr. Clifton out of the way before a Blow was given ? Said , he believed he did . Peter Gilliere depos 'd , That he coming by and seeing several People together , he went to see what was the Matter , when he saw the Deceased strike Mrs Clifton in a Violent Manner , and that the Noise of the Blow sounded like the Noise of a Whip , but that he did not then see Mr. Clifton strike the Deceased ; neither was there any Obstruction in the Way , but that the Deceased might have passed about his Business , and that the Son of the Deceased would have perswaded him to come along , but he obstinately refused it , and continued to insult Mr. Clifton with the utmost Violence , not only before he drew his Sword , but afterwards ; all which Time Mr. Clifton 's Back was towards the Pastrycook 's Shop in a leaning Posture , using his Sword only as a Guard , not offering to make a Pass , but that the Deceased beat down the Sword , and being in Drink , fell forwards , and ran the Sword in his own Body , without the least Motion from Mr. Clifton . John Cammeron depos 'd , That he saw Mr. Clifton with a Cane in his Hand and a Pinch of Snuff between his Fingers of the same Hand , and the Deceased at the same Time flourishing a Stick or Cane , saying , D - n you for a Scoundrel , draw your Sword Rascal , I do n't value your Sword of a Farthing ; I can use a Cane as well as you can a Sword , giving Mr. Clifton a hard Blow on the Shoulder , till at length the Prisoner drew his Sword , but did not make a Pass , and striking with more than ordinary Violence , he hit Mr. Clifton on the Shoulder , which beat down his Sword , and the Deceased being in Drink staggered forwards and fell upon the Point of Mr. Cliston 's Sword , running at him like a mad Man . This Deponent further depos 'd , That after the Deceased had received the fatal Wound he struck a desperate Blow at Mr. Clifton , but missing him hit this Deponent 's Arm , which was not well for a Month after . Thomas Lambert depos 'd , That he coming by at the Hour , mentioned in the Indictment ; against Suffolk-street End , saw Mr. Clifton learning against a Pastry-cook 's Grate , when the Deceased coming along , Mr. Clifton said , take Care ; upon which the Deceased said , What must I take care of D - n you , do you think I am afraid of a Sword , and flourishing his Cane struck Mr. Cliston on the Shoulder , and that then Mr. Clifton Struck at the Deceased , but reeling miss 'd him , upon which the Deceas 'd struck Mr. Clifton again , and that then Mr. Cliston drew , but did not make a Pass at the Deceased , only striking , at him , as was mentioned by the other Evidences . This Deponent endeavouring to part them by running between them , was push 'd away by the Deceas 'd . After the Hearing of these Evidences Mr. Clifton made a moving Defence , in which he express 'd himself under the utmost Concern for the unhappy Accident that brought him before the Court , saying , he should think his Life too short to lament the fatal Necessity he was brought into of preserving it at the Expence of that of his Fellow-Creature . My Grief , said he , on this Occasion , would have been far less supportable had it been attended with the Consciousness of Guilty ; but this I can affirm with Truth , that though my Hand was Guilty , yet my Heart was entirely free : He observed , that through the whole Course of the Evidence already given , nothing had been laid to his Charge , that carried with it the least Colour of malice against the unfortunate Man ; That the very Blows he gave him with his Sword were a plain Indication how little he had Mischief at Heart . He then observ 'd , it was unanimously agreed , notwithstanding the several Blows he receiv 'd , that he never made the least Attempt upon his Life : On the contrary , that Mr. Gilliere , Cameron , and Lambert were in this Point all agreed , that the Time at which the Decased receiv 'd his Wound , he forced himself upon the Point of his Sword ; this , he said , was a Circumstance that offered him no small Comfort under this Misfortune , and he doubted not but it would have its just Weight with the Gentlemen of the Jury . Mr. Clifton then giving the Court a short Account of his spending the aforesaid Day , and the Particulars of the Tragical Scene , desired Leave of the Court that he might have the Liberty to call two or three more who had seen the Beginning of the Affair , and as he said , might lay it still in a clearer Light than had been done by the other Witnesses , at the same Time he took Notice , that hitherto there had not appeared one positive Evidence to prove him the Aggressor ; even Mr. Ehnes himself , ( the Son of the Deceas 'd ) Mr. Clifton observ 'd to the Court , was so far from being clear in this Particular , that he own 'd he could not pretend to say , but for what he knew , his father might have struck him first . That such Language from the Son of the Deceas 'd , seemed , in his humble Opinion , to be so far from weakening the Evidence given in his Favour , that confirm 'd it beyond Contradiction . And then Mr. Clifton call 'd the following Witnesses . Tho Dalton depos 'd , That the Night on which this unlucky Accident happen 'd , he had been at Cavendish Market-place , and that standing to make Water , the Deceased came by , and rushing against the Prisoner , almost flung him down , and upon the Deponents 's only saying , Who is there , the Deceased turning about , said D - n ye , what do you stand there for , and gave him the most opprobrious Language on this trivial Occasion : After which , this Deponent followed the Deceas 'd , and saw him overtake the Prisoner , and seemed as if he would have taken the Wall ; upon which some Words pass 'd , and the Deceas 'd behav 'd himself according to the Deposition of the forementioned Witnesses . Mr. Fitzgerald depos 'd , That he was with the Surgeon who dress 'd the Deceased 's Wounds a Quarter of an Hour after it happen 'd and that then the Deceased confess 'd he was drunk when it was done , of which this Gentleman desired the Company to take Notice . After this Mr. Clifton intimated to the Court that there were several Persons present , who had done him the Honour to come on this Occasion , and might convince their Lordships of his Character , and accordingly several Persons of the first Rank and Quality appeared in his Behalf ; who severally depos 'd , That they had known the Prisoner , some 5 or 6 Years , others more , and that he had ever behaved himself with the utmost Civility and good Manners , being of a very peaceable Behaviour , and not given to commit Disorders ; even when he was in Drink , his Mirth was attended with Modesty , and not then inclin 'd to Quarrelling or Extravagance . After this Mr. Clifton begg 'd Leave to mention to the Court , what appeared to him upon this Evidence to be the Result of the whole : To this End he observ 'd , That as the Deceas 'd was proved the Aggressor by the Depositions of several unexceptionable Witnesses , as well those who appear 'd in Behalf of his Majesty , as those other Gentlemen which were more immediately concerned in Behalf of himself . It is not insinuated , says Mr. Clifton , even by the Son of the Deceas 'd , as if he believ 'd I ever made a Pass at his Father ; and that by the Depositions of Mr. Gilliere , Mr. Cameron , and Mr. Lambert it was positively affirmed , That the Deceased was the immediate Occasion of his own Destruction . If the Case stands thus , as I humbly conceive it does , I question not but your Lordships , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , will be more inclin 'd to compassionate my Misfortune , than condemn the Action . Upon the Whole , the Court judiciously weigh-every minute Circumstance , gave their Opinion , That the greatest Stress which could be laid on the Action could make it no other than simple Manslaughter , of which the Jury found him guilty . [ Branding . See summary . ] John Wells , was indicted for stealing two Ounces of humane Hair , which he had made up into a Wig , Value 2 s . on the 22d of June last , the Goods of Richard Brown : To prove the Fact upon the Prisoner , the Prosecutor produced a Lock of Hair , and comparing it with the Wig , it was of the same Colour , from whence he would have inferr 'd , that the Wig was made of his Hair , as the Prisoner had some time been his Servant : But as it is difficult to swear to the Identity of Hair , and the Prosecutor having no clear Argument to confirm the Fact upon the Prisoner , he was acquitted . Ann Senior of St. Mary-le-bone was indicted for feloniously stealing three Guineas , in the Dwelling House of Samuel Thresher . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That he had taken the Prisoner in as his Servant , and that missing his Money out of a Chest of Drawers , he had Suspicion on her , and sent one to enquire after her character , and that in the Interim the Prisoner ran away , but pursuing , he took her before a Magistrate , where she confess 'd the Fact , and returned two Guineas . Anne Cornish confirmed the Evidence of the Prosecutor , by making Oath that the Prisoner confess 'd , the Fact to her , and that she was present when the Prisoner returned Part of the Money , confessing at the same Time , that she had dropp 'd the other Part in a Value . These plain Evidences , and the Prisoner having nothing to say in her Defence , she was found Guilty . Death . Richard Martin of St. Magnus by the Bridge , was indicted for privately and feloniously stealing a Purse , Value 3d . and some Money , the Property of Margaret Marlow . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That as she was walking home on the 13th of May , about 7 in the Evening , she not being disturbed by any Person before the Prisoner came up to her and jostled against her , and cut off her pocket , and being taken he then confess 'd the Fact ; And having nothing to say in his Defence , the Jury found him guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] Mary Jones and Mary Freeman were indicted for Forgery , in contriving and procuring Letters Testamentary , in order to cheat and defraud the Heirs of Thomas Moulso of Wages due to him for service on board one of his Majesty 's Ships . Honest Dame Wetheridge depos 'd , That she with the Prisoner went to a Brandy-shop , where it was agreed , that Mary Freeman was to go by the Name of Martha Howard , which she did , and appear 'd at Doctors Commons , where the Will was proved , they afterwards sold the Powers to one Elliard : But notwithstanding the Evidence was full against them , some Disputes arising in Law with regard to Mistakes in the Indictment , they were acquitted . Edward Anchors , of St. Dunstan 's Stepney , was indicted for a Misdemeanor , in forging a Will in the Name of Volantine Cloyson , for Wages due to him for Service on Board his Majesty 's Ship the Leopard : The Counsel for the King moved to the Court , that the Prisoner having been a Clerk to several Captains of Ships , had made himself acquainted with the Names and Circumstances of private Mariners , and had therefore the better Opportunity to prosecute his wicked Intentions ; that for some Years he had followed the Practice of Counterfeiting Wills , and getting some evil disposed Persons to prove them . If a single Man died on Board any Ship , and it came within the Compass of his knowledge he immediately fell to work in making his Will , which he would assign over in some fictitious Name , to one of his Gang , in the Name of a well beloved Friend , and take the Wages due to the Person deceased , to the great Detriment of his Majesty 's Subjects , and the Discouragement of those who hazard their Lives in his Majesty 's Service . If a married Man died , he would form a Will assign 'd to the Deceased 's Wife , and employ a Sister of Wapping to personate the said Widow of the Deceas 'd ; but as Justice at one Time or other overtakes the most secure Offenders , so the Prisoner was taken and found guilty of the Charge laid to him in the Indictment , and for which he is to suffer such Shame and Disgrace as the Law directs for such Offenders , for the Jury found him guilty . [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] Catharine Banfield , of St. Sepulchre 's , was indicted for the inhumane Murther of John Cornish , a Child of a Year and a Half old , by willfully burning it in a Fire on the 16th of June last , of which it instantly died . The Mother of the Deceas 'd with the utmost Concern depos 'd , That the Child was burnt from the Waist so the Toes in a surprising Manner , and that the Prisoner , who was its Nurse , did not acquaint them with it till the Saturday after its Death , which happened on Wednesday . William Cornish , Father of the Deceas 'd depos 'd , That the Nurse would have buried the Child from her own House , without letting them into the secret Cause of its Death , telling him it died of an After-clap Fit ( a difficult Term to Construe . ) The Prisoner in her Defence said , That the Fire happened by Accident to take hold of the Child 's Cloaths , and that she being out of the Room , it was unfortunately burnt before any one could come to its Assistance . The Court was induced to believe this Account from the following Circumstances : First , Because the Prosecutor could not prove that the Prisoner was conscious or fore apprized of the Accident . And 2dly , It seem 'd a Contradiction , That a Woman should in such a Manner contribute , or be any Ways assistant towards the Death of the Child , when at the same Time she took it but for weekly Wages , and by Consequence proposed some Advantage to herself from the Child 's Life , but could propose none from its Death ; upon which Consideration the Jury acquitted her . John Perkins , of St. Clement Danes , was indicted for privately stealing 8 Yard and a Half of Shalloon , value 8 s. on the 6th of this Instant July , the Goods of John Billbary . Mary Sage depos 'd , That she saw the Prisoner take the Goods mentioned in the Indictment , and being pursued , she saw him drop them : Which Evidence being plain against him , the Jury found him guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] Rose Roberts , was indicted for assaulting Sarah Router on the Highway , on the 24th of April last , putting her in fear , and endeavouring to take from her a Gold Necklace ; but upon Examination it appeared only to be a gilt one , and the Assault no other than a Geneva Jostle . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That she , with her Mother and Grandmother had been at a Christening , and coming home , near Windmill-Hill the Prisoner came up to her and broke her Necklace from her Neck , which fell down into her Bosom ; upon this the Prisoner was apprehended , and the Prosecutor 's Friends made Overtures to her of making it up without a Prosecution , but she not agreeing to their Proposition , was arraign 'd for an Assault , which appearing to the Court to be a malicious Prosecution she was acquitted , and a Copy of her Indictment granted her . Thus they who would have made a Court of Justice a Handle to commit unjust Actions , are brought under the Cognizance of the Law for such unlawful Proceedings . Elizabeth Lucas , of St. Leonards Shoreditch , was indicted for stealing a Linnen Gown , a Cotton Petticoat , and other wearing Apparel , the Goods of Elizabeth Huoyes , which Goods she confest she had stolen and pawn 'd with one Mitchel , a Pawnbroker in George Yard in Whitechapel , who refused to let the Prosecutor see the Goods or produce then at the Trial , though she made him sensible of the Affair ; but 't is hoped the just Measures the Court took with him on that Occasion may be a Lesson to the Gentlemen of that honest Prosession . Guilty to the Val . of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] Sylvia Sherlock , of Noron Falgate , was indicted for privately stealing 7 l. in the House of Charles Headman , on the 28th of June last , of which she having made Confession , and the Fact proving undeniably plain , the Jury found her guilty of the Indictment . Death . Philip Philips , of St. Gregory 's , was indicted for stealing a Silver Spoon , and 12 Shillings in Money , from the Person of Elizabeth Booth , on the 28th of Feb . last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That the Prisoner and another Person came to her House on the Day aforesaid , and drank a considerable Quantity of Gin and Wormwood , which raising the Prisoner to a more than ordinary Elevation , he offered Rudeness to her , and perswading her over the Way to his own House , would there have been more familiar than her Modesty would admit of ; after this he came home to her House . again , and continued his Rudeness , insomuch that the Prosecutor lost her Pocket and the Money mentioned in the Indictment : But it appearing to the Court that his Design was only on her Charity , and not on her Property , the Jury acquitted him P. S. Agnes Bird depos 'd , That the Sunday after this happened , she heard the Prosecutor say she could not prove the Robbery on him , she would swear a Rape against him ; but she did not appear to be so Ill-natur 'd a Person , that Mr. Jacob Galen , ( who was one of her Evidences , and declared he had made her his Wife before now , if this Accident had not happened ) need not fear his meeting with a true Inhabitant of Creed-Lane , and a Friend to Liberty and Property . Henry Piercy , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing five Silk Handkerchiefs , value 4 s. the Goods of Persons unknown : It appeared that the Prisoner had pickt the Pocket of my Lord Camickle , and being taken in the Fact , his Lordship ordered his Servants to give him due Correction , but they finding several Handkerchiefs upon him , thought convenient to bring him to publick Justice . The Jury found him guilty to the Value of 10 d [ Transportation . See summary . ] William Cross , of St. Leonard 's Shoreditch , was indicted for stealing the Box of a Sapping Loom , value 5 s. on the 15th of May last , the Goods of Henry Barns ; but the Prisoner making it appear that he lent the Goods to a Person who lost them , he was acquitted and discharged .
