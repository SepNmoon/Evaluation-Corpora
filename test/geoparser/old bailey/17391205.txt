This Mark [ + ] is prefixed to such Indictments on which the Prisoners would receive Sentence of Death , should the Jury find them Guilty , generally ; which will in this Case , and many others , account for the Jury 's finding specially the Value of the Goods to be less than is laid in the Indictment . The following are Capital Offences , viz . Privately taking above the Value of 1 s. from the Person . Stealing the Value of 5 s. out of a Shop , Warehouse , Coach-house or Stable . Stealing the Value of 40 s. out of a Dwelling-house . Mrs. Fountain . I am a Widow , and live in St. Martin 's Lane . On the 14th of November I lost this Piece of Cloth ; 't is about twenty-two Yards , and the Value of it is 20 s. I sell Linnen Cloth ; and the Prisoner came into my Shop ( with another Woman ) between Three and Four o'Clock that Afternoon , and I thought they had been acquainted with each other . The Prisoner asked for nothing , but the other Woman asked for Cloth , and bought some of my Daughter . After she had paid for it , she went away , and the Prisoner with her , but she ( who had been the Customer ) returned presently , and said , - I believe you have lost something , look after that Woman that was in the Shop : I said , - O Lord ! I thought she had belonged to you ! and immediately I ran out of the Shop , and saw the Prisoner at the Corner of Long-Acre , I pursu 'd her , and she ran away very hard , upon which I call 'd out , - Stop that Woman ! and accordingly she was stopp 'd in Angel-Alley by Thomas Holder . As soon as he took hold of her , she squatred down on the Ground , but he lifted up her Cloak , and found this Piece of Cloth , which is mine , and was lost off my Counter . When the Cloth was found , she beg 'd Pardon , and desir 'd she might be let go for God 's Sake , for she was a poor-Widow , and had two Children . I was mov 'd , and sorry for her ; but the People about us bid me carry her back to my Shop , and there she fell down on her Knees , and again ask 'd Forgiveness : I told her , she had not offended me , and bid her ask Pardon of God ; then the Beadle came up , and took her before Mr. De Veil , and so she was brought here . Thomas Holder . I took the Cloth from under the Prisoner 's Cloak , in Angel-Alley , in the Presence of Mrs. Fountain , and by her Order . The Prisoner own 'd she took it , and beg 'd Pardon . Guilty , 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 2 . + Susannah Broom , of St. Paul Shadwell , was indicted , for that she , not having GOD before her Eyes , & c. on the 11th of September , in and upon John Broom , her Husband , feloniously and traiterously did make an Assault , and with a certain Knife made of Iron and Steel , val . 1 d. which she the said Susannah had and held in her Right Hand , him the said John , in and upon the Inside of the Calf of the Right Leg , did strike , stab and thrust , giving him a mortal Wound of the Length of four Iuches , and the Depth of two Inches , of which mortal Wound he instantly died . She was a second Time indicted , by virtue of the Coroner 's Inquest , for the said Felony and Murder . William Allen . I knew the Prisoner and her Husband : He was an old Man , about Sixty . I live in a Room adjoining to that in which they liv 'd . About three Months ago , - I ca n't tell the Day of the Month , but it was the Night the great Thunder and Lightning happen 'd , about One or Two o'Clock , I heard the old Man cry , - For God 's Sake do n't murder me ! for Christ 's Sake do n't murder me ! Several Times he ( thus ) cry 'd out , but I did not go out of my Room , for she was an obstinate Woman , and used to quarrel with him . I have saved him from her a great many Times . I believe that she was at this time in the Room with him , but I did not hear her Voice , - I did not hear her say one Word to him ; and after he had cry 'd out ( as above ) for the Space of a Quarter of an Hour , I heard no more of him , nor did I see him till the Coroner 's Jury sat upon him , which was the Night following . Prisoner . I never saw this Witness at that Time . Allen . I was sent for by the Coroner , to give an Account of the Words which I heard the Man speak ; and then he was dead , - I am sure he ought to be so , for I never saw a Man so cut in my Life : He had a great Cut quite cross the Calf of his Right Leg , and two Cuts in his Thighs . Prisoner . Did you ever see me take up a Knife to my Husband in your Life ? But because he was a naughty , bloody Man , have not I hid the Knife in your House ? Allen . She did bring her Goods to my House , and I bid her carry them back again to her Husband . There was not a more quiet Man on Earth than he was . Prisoner . Did not you let me a Garret , that I might live from him ? Allen . She asked me what I would have a Week for a Garret ; I told her Six pence ; and she brought some Goods into it , and she lay in it a little while herself : but the Room in which I heard the Cry was that in which they lived together . She was the wickedest Woman on Earth Susanna Anderson . About Ten o'Clock in the Morning , after the Man was killed , Mr. Mangham , who lodged in the same House with the Prisoner and the Deceased , told me , he believed Mr. Broom was murder 'd , and that his Wife had kill 'd him ; and he desired the Neighbours to open the Door : They did so ; and I went up Stairs with them , and found the Deceased lying on his Back , upon the Bed , but his Legs hung down , and his Feet were on the Ground . He was cold and stiff ; but his Eyes were open , and he was cut in a very vile Manner . There was a great Cut cross the Calf of his Right Leg , ( I think ) 't was almost to the Bone , two great Wounds in his Thigh , several upon his Shoulders , and a Cut across his Belly as if he had had a great Scratch with a large Pin . All his Cloaths were upon him , except his Shirt , and there was no Blood upon him , for he seem 'd to have had his Wounds wash 'd . The Prisoner was not in the House when we view 'd the Body ; I saw her go out in the Morning , about Seven , all over bloody , and Mangham was with her , Cheek by Jole . Tho ' there was no Blood upon the Deceased , yet there was so much upon the Floor ; that as soon as I had stepp 'd into the Room ; the Blood was over the Sole of my Shoe : The Bolster , the Sheets and the Blankets were likewise all over Blood . This Cap and this Handkerchief I found on the father Side of the Bed , [ they both appear 'd as if they had been dipped in Blood ] I know them to be the Prisoner 's , and have seen her wear them . Mangham lodg 'd in their House , and at this time there was nobody therein , but Mangham , the Deceased and the Prisoner . The first Witness ( Allen ) does not live in the same House with them , but at the next Door , and the Head of his Bed stands against their Room . Prisoner . I have some Cuts in my Hand which he gave me before I went to Bed ; and as to this Witness , - I would not take her Word for a Farthing . She 'd swear any one 's Life away . Simon Manghant . I sell old Whalebone in Rag-fair , and had lodged in the House where the Prisoner and Deceased lived about a Month before this happen 'd . I lay in the Garret over the Room in which they lay ; and that Night he was murder 'd , about Three o'Clock , he came up into my Garret , to case himself in my Pot ; after which he asked me to let him lie down with me , I told him he might , but in half an Hour the Prisoner came up , and fetch 'd him down again , after which I heard no Noise at all . At Six in the Morning I got up and drest me , to go out about my Business , and as I pass 'd her Chamber Door , I saw the Prisoner at the Bed 's Feet ; she had pack 'd up her Things to carry them out , and said , she would not stay with her Husband . I went into the Room , and it being Day-light , I saw him cover 'd with a Blanket or Rug , but I did not know he was dead . There was a great deal of Blood in the Room , but she told me , she had lost much Blood herself , in a Quarrel ( I suppose she meant ) with her Husband , and I did not suspect he was dead then , for she said she would not stay to be murder 'd , and having packt up her Things in a Bundle , she put them in her Lap , and we both came down Stairs , and I went out with her . She lock 'd the Door , and took the Key with her , and when we had got about half an hundred Yards from the House , she gave the Key to me in the Field in the Back-lane . - What Harm is there in that ? I was going at that Time about my Business to Rag-fair , and she went that Way with me , but she walked faster than I could , and left me at the Corner of White's-Yard ; where I went in for a Pint of Beer , and did not mind which Way the Prisoner went : Then I return 'd home , and went up Stairs , and found the Man warmish ; he was laid upon the Bed , and cover 'd with a Blanket or Rug : He had a black Waistcoat on , and his Eyes and Mouth were open ; he was warm , but quite dead . This was about a Quarter of an Hour after the Prisoner and I went out together . I saw no Wounds , for I did not open the Bed , but I came down Stairs again , lock 'd the Door , and carry 'd the Landlord the Key of the House . As I went down the Alley I met this Woman [ Anderson ] - no , I do n't know whether I met her at this Time , or whether I met her before I came back to the House . Mrs. Anderson . I saw him go out with the Prisoner , and he then did not speak to me : But when he returned I saw him and spoke to him . Mangham . I do n't remember what I said to the Neighbours , nor whether I speak to any of them , but a great many of them went up Stairs with me , When I first went up . There were several People saw the Deceas 'd , - a great Number , - five or six , besides me and the Landlord . I do n't know any of their Names , for I never had any Society with them ; but they went upStairs - I said noHarm , - I do n't know what I should be afraid for . As to the Deceased , I never saw any Harm by him in my Life . Jury . Had you no Discourse with the Prisoner as you went along ? Mangham . I did not ask her any Questions , nor did she say any thing to me . Prisoner . Ask him if he knows that I ever took up a Knife , or any thing to do my Husband any Harm . Mangham . No , never in my Life . Mary Matthias : I live at the Head of the Alley , and the Prisoner lived next Door to me , down the Alley . I heard nothing of the Murder , till Mangham came back and brought the Key ; but I saw him and the Prisoner go out together about Seven o'Clock in the Morning . Her Left Hand and her Face were bloody , and she had a Bundle in her Lap . I was looking out of my Window , and seeing a Neighbour , I cry 'd , Lord how bloody Mother Broom is ! I suppose they have been fighting To-night , says she , but if they have , they have been very quiet : For she has beat him out of Doors divers and divers ( of ) Times , and she has sent him divers Times to a Two-penny Lodging . Mangham did not bring the Key , till about Ten o'Clock ; and I was afraid to go up with the People at that time ; but I went about an Hour after , with several others , and he then lay strait upon the Bed . He was cut in one Part of his Leg , and had a Cut upon the Calf of the other , and across the Thighs , and three more across his Navel , and was likewise stabbed in the Breast . He was cold , but his Eyes were opens and there was a great deal of Blood in the Room . Mangham was charged in Custody of an Officer , and I went before Justice Jones with him . The Justice asked me , believed he had been concerned ? I told him , I believed he was innocent , for he one Speck of Blood upon him . Prisoner . Have seen me do my Husband any Harm ? Matthias . I have her beat him out of Doors a great man , and have often called out to her , - or God 's sake let your Husband in ! Mary Coombes . I live underneath the Room that Allen lives in , and my Door when opened , staps against the Prisoner 's , in the same Passage ; but in September last , ( I do n't know the particular Day ) between Twelve and One o'Clock at Night heard the Deceased in the Yard , cry , - Susan ! Susan ! Pray let me in , for I am very cold ! The Prisoner looked out of the Window and said , - get away you Rogue , for you have brought no Money ; you have been with your Whores . I heard no more 'till about Three ; therefore I suppose she let him in ; and about Three o'Clock , the Deceased cry 'd out Murder ! Murder ! Murder ! For Christ 's sake ! - What , are you going to kill me ! I was in Bed , and my Door fastened against theirs ; and by the Cry , I knew it must be the Deceased 's Voice , in the Chamber . The last Words which I heard him speak were , - Broom ! Broom ! for Christ 's Sake ! for God 's Sake ! Do n't kill me , - do n't murder me in this Manner ! I am positively sure I heard these Words , Broom ! Broom ! & c. About Seven o'Clock in the Morning after this , I met the Prisoner and Mangham going out together : She had the same Cloak on then , that she has now , and a Bundle in her Apron , but I saw no Blood upon her , for our Passage is dark . I did not speak to her , nor she to me , - neither good , bad , nor indifferent . Mangham afterwards came back and called out , - Mr. Broom ! Mr. Broom ! come down and open the Door . But no Answer being made , he desired me to open the Door for him : I said . - Mrs. Broom is a very turbulent Woman , I will not meddle with her Door ; and so I went to hang up a Gown to dry in the Yard . When I came back , the Door had been opened , and he ( Mangham ) cry 'd - Lord ! Lord ! Mrs. Broom has killed her Husband , and he lies dead upon the Bed ! I ran up Stairs , and found the Room like a Slaughter-house with Blood . The Deceased 's Stockings were down : He had his Breeches on , and a dark-coloured Waistcoat , but no Shirt . He was cold as a Stone : His Right-hand was cut ; his Eyes wide open ; the Calt of his Right-leg was cut , but there was not a Speck of Blood upon him , for he had been washed clean , and there stood a half Tub of Water above Stairs . When I came down Stairs , in the lower Room , by the Side of the Dresser , there lag a Pillow , with a white Pillow-case , sprinkled all over with Blood . This was in the lower Room . The Bolster of the Bed on which the Deceased lay , and the Sheet , were all over with Blood , and were doubled up and thrust a little Way from him ; but there was no Blood upon him , nor on his Cloaths , nor were any Cuts in them . There was likewise two Cuts on his Left-hand , two on his Thigh ; one a-cross the Belly , like the Scratch of a Pin , and a little Stab under the left Pap , which I believe was an old one . On the Left side there were Marks as if he had been pricket , all black and blue , she was a mighty Woman for carrying a Pen-knife with two Blades , which she valued very much , and said , she had a great Respect for that Knife , and it would do her good Service . When she and her Husband quarrell 'd , she used to beat him with the Poker , and say , she would win the Horse , or loose the Saddle . I have often taken her Husband 's Part , and then she would call me his Whore . Prisoner . Did you ever see me take up any Edge-Tool , any Scissars , or Knife , to abuse him with ? Coombes . I have seen her beat him several times with the Poker , and have heard him cry out Murder ! She came to Mrs. Birch , about a Month before this Fact was committed , in a desperate Passion and said , This Man wo n't pay my Rent , - I shall be murdered for him . I have seen her go down the Street with him , and as she has gone along with him , she has beat his Head against a Sash-Window , and broke it . Prisoner . Fye upon you ! He went to get a Stick to beat me with ; - did he not ? Martha Eaton . I live in West 's Gardons , at the End of the Street , in which the Deceased lived . The Prisoner came that Morning to my Shop . about Three o'Clock , for a Farthing Candle : Her Arms and Face were all over Blood , and likewise the Round of her Head . I asked her if her Husband had been beating her ? She said , yes , - he had been beating her in the Garden . I said it was a cruel Thing to beat a Woman so . Aye , says she , - I have been married above forty Years , and have had seventeen Children . I saw no Wounds upon her ; only a little Punch in her Arm , which had never bled . William Brown , Surgeon . I saw the Deceased about Twelve o'Clock the same Day . He lay with his Back upon the Bed , and his Feet upon the Ground . He had several Cuts upon his Belly , and about his Thighs ; but that which was mortal , was under the Right-calf , for the crural Artery was divided , and the Essusion of Blood must have been so great , that he could not live a Quarter of an Hour . The Blood upon the Floor ran from under that Leg . I believe the Wound was given with a Knife , but it must have been made by more than one or two Essays , because it was much hacked . William Anderson . I took the Prisoner at Burford , in Oxfordshire , about twelve or thirteen Weeks ago . She was going thro ' the Town , and I knew her and seized her . I had been in London about a Week after the Murder , and had heard that she was charged with it ; and seeing her in Burford , about three Weeks after , I took her before 'Squire London , and there she said , she heard that her Husband was murdered , and there was nothing left for her , tho ' she should have gone to see after him . She told me , - he was always quarrelling with her , and she found a Pen-knife in the Bed with him , when she went that Night to Bed . I took her from her Sister 's , at The Royal Oak , at Burford . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . 3 . + William Barkwith was indicted for assaulting Geldsborough Griffin , Esq ; on the King 's Highway , in the Parish of Heston , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him 12 s. in Money , Nov. 13 . Mr. Griffin . I do n't know the Prisoner . I was robb 'd about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon , on Tuesday the 13th of November , on Hounslow Heath , in the Parish of Heston , of twelve Shillings . I was coming over the Heath in a Chariot ; and the Person that robb 'd me , came up with a Pistol , and order 'd the Chariot to Stop : It was stopp 'd accordingly , and the Man demanded my Money and my Gold , and threaten 'd to shoot me . The Glass was drawn up , but he swore he would fire through it , if I did not let it down . Upon this I let it down , and he demanded my Money and Gold , - those were the Words . I told him , I did not travel with Gold about me , because I had no Occasion for it , but I had some Silver , and he was welcome to that ; so I put four Half-Crowns and two Shillings into his Hand . I could not discover any thing of his Face , because he had either a Mask or a Crape over it . When he had got my Money he went away , and my Servant told some People who came by , that I had been robb 'd by one who was just gone before . They pursu 'd him , and took a Man ; but I am not certain whether he was the Person that robb 'd me . I was coming to London , and so the Man was brought to Town likewise , and was carry 'd before Colonel De Veil , and I was present when he was examin 'd , but he neither deny 'd not confess 'd the Fact . Prisoner . I desire he may be asked , whether he is pretty positive to the Hour ? Mr. Griffin . I reckon it was about Three o'Clock , or between Three and Four ; it was light . Prisoner . I would ask him , if he had a Watch in his Pocket . Mr. Griffin . I had ; but I did not look at it . There was a Gentleman in the Chariot with me at the same time . Prisoner . I ask him , whether he put the Glass down himself , or the Gentleman that was with him ? Mr. Griffin . The Gentleman who was with me let the Glass down . Prisoner . Just now he said he let the Glass down himself . Mr. Griffin . He did it by my Order ; - there 's nothing in that . As to the Horse the Man was upon , I saw nothing but his Head , the rest of his Body was behind the Chariot Wheel . Henry Mascal . On Tuesday the 13th of November , I was driving my Master over Hounslow-Heath . About Three o'Clock a Man on Horseback stopp 'd me ; then he went up to the Side of the Chariot , and swore he would shoot through the Glass , if it was not let down . As soon as the Glass was down , he bid my Master deliver his Silver and Gold : He told the Highwayman , he never travel 'd with Gold about him , but always with a little Silver to bear his Charges . When he had got what he could , he rode off , and one Mr. Stone coming along on Horseback I told him , my Master had been robb 'd , and he got Assistance , and pursu 'd and took the Prisoner , but I ca n't swear to him ; I thought he had rode on a bayish Horse . Prisoner . I would ask the Witness , whether he did not tell Colonel De Veil , when we were all before him , that he believed I was not the Man . Mascal . I did say , I thought he was not the Man . - I did not see his Face when the Fact was committed . Prisoner . I ask him , whether he did not assign two Reasons before Colonel De Veil , why he thought I was not the Man ? Whether one was not , - that the Man who robb 'd the Chariot had a lighter colour 'd Coat ; and the other , - that the Man was something taller than I am . Mascal . I was so frighted , that I could not tell what colour 'd Coat he had on ; I said nothing like that , but I took him to be a taller Man than the Prisoner . The Prisoner was carry 'd before Colonel De Veil the next Morning . John Stone . I was coming from London the 13th of November , and about Three o'Clock , between Hounslow and Butcher 's Grove , I saw a Chariot stopp 'd , and a Man at the Side of it . I kept riding on , and saw the Man ( who had been at the Chariot ) move off When I came to the Chariot , the Servant said , Sir , we have been robb 'd by that Person who is just gone along . I rode gently along , and saw a Man turn down towards a Place called Cranford ; I follow 'd him , but lost Sight of him at a Turning in the Road : However , I rode to my Lord Berkley 's Steward at Cranford , and borrowed a loaded Gun , then I went in Pursuit of him again till I came to Uxbridge , and in a Lane near Lord Bolingbroke 's Park , I saw a Man off his Horse , making Water , and I believ 'd him to be the same Man I had pursu 'd on Horseback ; but as I was alone , I did not chuse to attack him myself , so I stopp 'd my Horse , and turn 'd him round , and saw a Man coming to my Assistance with a Blunderbuss . Then we went forward , and the Man fled ; we rode very hard after him , but my Assistant 's Horse 's Bridle happening to break , we were obliged to stop a little , and so the Person we pursu 'd got out of our Sight . For some little time we kept on in the straight Road , but not seeing him , we turn 'd towards Arlington-Fields , and went down a Lane into an open Field , and there my Companion caught Sight of him again . He ( finding himself pursu 'd ) rode into a Lane that leads to Lord Bolingbroke 's Park , but there being a Gentleman 's House at the End of the Lane , he turn 'd his Horse short , and came up again by the Canal , where he met us full-but , and we were within forty or fifty Yards of him , only there were some Pales and a Ditch with Water between . When he saw us so very near him , he seem 'd to be very much surprized , and put his Hand into his Pocket , or Bosom , as if he felt for his Pistol ; upon which the Man who was with me bid him stop , or he was a dead Man . I cry 'd , - for God 's Sake do n't shoot him , and then the Prisoner turn 'd short again , his Hat sell off , and he rode away without it , through a Place where there were near twenty People grubbing up Wood . We follow 'd him , and cry 'd , Highwayman ! Highwayman ! but lost Sight of him again . We hunted after him an Hour ; and Night coming on , we gave him over for lost ; but as I was making the best of my Way home towards Drayton , in a common Field I stood still a little , to consider which was my nearest Way . While I stood still , a Man halloo 'd to me and I saw three Men had got hold of the Prisoner . I am positive the Prisoner is the Man they had seiz 'd . When I got up to them , I bid them carry him to a Publick-House , and I think I gave the Constable Charge of him myself . Prisoner . I would humbly request he may be ask 'd , if he is sure I am the Person he had been in Pursuit of ? Mr. Stone . I ca n't take upon me to say he is the same Man I pursu 'd ; for I never was so near him as to see his Face plainly , and his Cape was done up about it . The Horse he rode on was a brown bay Mare or Gelding . Robert England . I was Servant to my Lord Berkley at Cransord . Mr. Stone came to my Lord 's Steward to borrow a Gun , and to ask for Assistance to take a Highwayman . The Steward desired me to follow his Friend Mr. Stone , and assist him . I took a Horse out of the Stable , and a Blunderbuss in my Hand , and overtook Mr. Stone in Lord Bolingbroke 's Lane . There we had the Prisoner in Sight , and rode hard after him , but my Horse 's Bridle happening to break , I was obliged to clap my Hands round his Neck to stop him a little while , and in the mean time we lost the Prisoner . As soon as we could , we followed him again , and upon Enquiry , we were told he had rode hard down the Lane ; so we made after him , and saw him ; which he perceiving , made a short Turn , round a Hedge by a Canal , into a Place where there were high Pales , and a Ditch between us , and here we met him . When he saw us coming up to him , he pulled a Pistol out of his Pocket ; upon which I presented my Blunderbus at him , and told him , if he did not stand , I would shoot him . He seeing this , turned his Horse short ; his Hat sell off , and he made the best of his Way to get off . This was about Three o'Clock . We rode hard after him ; he whipp 'd , and I whipp 'd ; but I lost Sight of him near Lord Bolingbroke 's . After this we enquired of some People who were grabbing up Roots , if a Man had not rode by , without a Hat ? They told us he was just gone past , but I never got fight of him more : For Mr. Stone and I parted soon after : he turned toward Cranford , and I went to Hounslow . Prisoner . Is he sure I am the Man he Pursued ? England . Yes ; I am sure he is the Man . I was not very near him , but I was near enough to see some of his Face , when I came up with him against the Pales , but not enough to know it again . Prisoner . Why then do you think I am the same Man you pursued ? England . By his Dress : He had a Surrout Coat and a Hood on it , to pull over his Head , and it was pulled over his Head at that same time ; he was a thin young Gentleman , and such he seems to be now . His Horse I took to be a bay Gelding , but it proves to be a bay Mare . Samuel Simon . I saw the Prisoner come riding very hard down a wide common Field ( in the Parish of Drayton ) without a Hat . His Horse was very much sweared , and in leaping over a Brook , the Horse and Rider had like to have been down . He turn 'd the Corner of the Hedge , and in a Minute 's Time I saw him on Foot ; then I and two others pursu 'd him down a little Lane , over a Hedge , into a Field , where we found him with a Pistol in his Hand , attempting to shoot himself through the Head : I begg 'd of him not to shoot himself , and then he turn 'd the Point of the Pistol toward me , and snapp 'd it ; I saw Fire , but it did not go off . I was fearful because of the Pistol , and fell back ; but finding he could not make the Pistol go off , I went up to him , and took him with it in his Hand . He told us he would hurt none of us , and said , he was ruin 'd and undone , for he had robb 'd a Gentleman 's Coach . We ask 'd him how much he got from the Coach ; he told us 12 s. but he had abused nobody , and therefore he begg 'd upon his Knees we would let him go . We told him we dar 'd not , and took him down the Field with us , and call 'd to Mr. Stone . As we were carrying him along , he told us , there was a Man in Pursuit of him , upon a grey Horse . Mr. Stone . I rode after him upon a grey Horse . Prisoner . Ask him , if he is positive I mention 'd a grey Horse , and if I did not say 't was a white Horse . Simon . He said it was a Man on a grey Horse . Prisoner . Ask him , whether I surrender 'd myself , or whether they took me by Force ? Simon . At the very Instant that I took hold of him , he said , he would not hurt any of us . This is the Pistol he then had ; 't is in the same Condition as it was at that Time . [ The Pistol was unscrew 'd , and was loaded with one Ball . ] John Taylor . As my Brother and I were coming along Dragon-Feild , at the Corner of the Hedge , we met the Prisoner riding , without a Hat . He rode a great Pace , and came up just against us , frequently looking behind him as he rode . He got over the Brook , and rode round the Corner of a Hedge , and was then out of our Sight . In a small Time he came up a Lane into our View again , and after he had stopp 'd a little while , he turn 'd round , and went back again . Then we follow 'd him , and found his Coat and his Whip in the Lane , but I did not see him quitting his Horse ; it was in a Place call 'd Holloway-Lane . I saw him run out of the Lane , into the open Field , and I follow 'd him thither , with a Stake I had got out of a Hedge : In this Field I saw him stand with a Pistol against his Head ; then he put it into his Pocket , and pull 'd out another : He made two Attempts to shoot himself . When I came up to him , he said , If you 'll use me like a Man , I will surrender to you . We told him , we would not hurt him , and desir 'd him to put down his Pistols ; one of them he put into his Pocket , and the other he kept in his Hand , which the former Witness took from him . This is the Pistol he had in his Pocket : I took it from thence , and 't is loaded with one Ball , but there 's not above a Corn or two of Powder in the Pan . He fell down on his Knees , and begg 'd we would let him go , telling us he was ruin 'd , for he had robb 'd a Gentleman 's Coach upon Hounslow-Heath , of 12 s. and had been pursu 'd by a Man upon a grey Horse . As we carry 'd him to Drayton , we met Mr. Stone , who search 'd him , but found nothing more upon him . William Marsh , Brother in Law to the last Witness , confirm 'd the former Witnesses . DEFENCE . Prisoner . There are several Gentlemen in Court , who well know , I have had the Honour to serve Mr. John Lewis of Lincolns Inn many Years , in the Quality of a Clerk . He is now retir 'd into the Country , and having no Occasion for a Clerk , he disiniss 'd me . Before my Dismission from his Service , I had Orders to go to Mr . Leak of Denham , to settle an Account between his present Wife and a Gentleman deceased , and I was now going to put the finishing Stroke to them . As to my carrying Pistols , I humbly hope I had some Reason so to do , the Roads being so much infested with Highwaymen , and as I was not of so much Quality as to ride with Holsters , I thought it more decent to carry them in my Pocket . I did not ride from these Gentlemen , till they in a most furious Manner rode after me , nor did I ride fast , till they threaten 'd to shoot me ; and I rode over common Fields , till I thought I was out of their Hands , but perceiving somebody at a Distance , like the Man who Pursu 'd me . I got off my Horse to screen myself from him . The Truth is , I did not confess any thing to these Men , but they have swore thus for Lucre and for the Reward ; and as to my offering to shoot myself , that is of a Piece with the rest . John Howel , Esq ; Mr. Lewis of Lincolns-Inn was my Clerk some Years ago : He afterward took Chambers himself , and the Prisoner was his Clerk for six or seven Years . He intrusted him , and he serv 'd him faithfully till about July or August last , when , having no great Occasion for a Clerk , he discharged him . The Prisoner has likewise done Business for me ; I have observ 'd him to be industrious for many Years , and this is the first Fault I have heard of him . John Hopkins , Esq ; I have had Chambers in Lincolns-Inn many Years ; and Mr. Lewis being a particular Friend of mine the Prisoner has frequently been at my Chambers ; I never observ 'd him to have behav 'd ill , and I believe if his Master had , he would have told me . As to this Fact , I have nothing to say . Mr. John Jenkins . I have Chambers on the next Stair-Case to Mr. Lewis . The Prisoner was several Years a hired Clerk to him . I had an Intimacy with Mr. Lewis ; and the Prisoner , in his Matter 's Absence , has often come to my Chambers for Instructions . When he has not been employ 'd in his Master 's Business , I have employ 'd him myself , and have observ 'd him to be a very industrious young Fellow . He has engross 'd Writings for me , ( when he has been at Leisure ) and has earn 'd considerable Sums of Money : He has receiv 'd several Sums for me , and likewise upon his Master 's Account ; the last Money I paid him was I think in July last . He was a Person I should not have suspected to have been guilty of such a Fact . Mr. David Lewis . Mr. Lewis , who was the Prisoner 's Master , is a distant Relation of mine , I have known this young Man as his Clerk for many Years . I look 'd upon him as a careful industrious young Man , one who had a very fair Character , and I never heard any thing otherwise of him till now . Thomas Lewis . The Prisoner was my Brother 's hired Clerk , about five or six Years . My Brother has been out of Town about two Years and a Half , during which Time he has been intrusted with Affairs of great Consequence , and continu 'd to act for him as his Clerk till very lately . My Brother has wrote me Word , that he has Effects in his Chambers to the Value of several Hundred Pounds , and if the Prisoner had been in such Distress as tempted him to illegal Courses , he believes he would sooner have disposed of some of those , than have run this Risque . In Confirmation of his Master 's good Opinion of him , he de sired me to supply him with what he wanted in Goal . I have heard his Master often give him a good Character , and have heard him say , he intended to be the making of him . He intended to have been here himself , but some Affairs of Consequence prevented him , and he is at the Distance of 150 Miles from hence . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty , Death . But recommended him to his Majesty 's Clemency . 4 + Thomas Watson was indicted for privately stealing a Silk Handkerchief , val . 18 d. from the Person of Thomas Broughton , Clerk , Nov. 17 .

Mr. Arnold . I am a Painter , and live in Covent-Garden . On the 29th of last Month , between Six and Seven o'Clock at Night , I was coming out of the City , and two Doors above Milford-Lane , near Arundel-street in the Strand , the Prisoner forced between me and the Houses . I turn 'd , and ask 'd him what he wanted , and would have given him the Way . My Watch was then in my Fob ; but a second Man came immediately up on the other Side of me , and the Prisoner and the second Man held me , while a Third took my Watch out of my Fob * . Then they all three ran away , and I cry 'd out , Stop Thief ! The Prisoner turn 'd down Arundel-street , and I pursu 'd him till I was out of Breath , and could run no longer , but * The Prisoner was indicted only for a Single Felony ; as it appears upon this Evidence , he might bavcharg 'd with a Street Robbery . he was follow 'd by others who overtook him and seiz 'd him , and he was search 'd directly , yet we found nothing upon him , except an old Razor . The other two got quite away . I am positive the Prisoner was the Man who held me by my left Arm , and I charged him with being an Accomplice as soon as he was taken . Indeed I think he is in some Measure accessary to the Loss of it ; and 't is very hard a Man ca n't walk the Streets of London , - 't is a very hard Case . We carry 'd the Prisoner before Colonel De Veil , and there he would confess nothing , only he said he had a Being in Rag fair ; but when he was at the Roundhouse , he said his Being was in Broad St Giles 's . I have advertis 'd the Watch , and offer 'd twelve Guineas for it again , but have not had it , and as for the Seal , I could not have such a one for two Guineas . In short , he 's the Man that laid Hands on me first , and held me till the two others came up ; and what could I do ? They might have knock 'd down three such little Fellows as I am . Robert Simmonds . I am Apprentice to Mr. Darves , a Bricklayer , in Holborn , and happen 'd ( at the Time the Gentleman lost his Watch ) to be coming through Arundel-street . There was a Cry of Stop Thief , and the Prisoner running very fast , I clapp 'd my Hands round his Waist , and stopp 'd him : He made no Resistance , though he had a Stick , but said the Fellow is gone this Way , and I was going after him , The Gentleman came presently up to us , and charg 'd him with being an Accomplice of those who stole his Watch . DEFENCE . Elizabeth Wade . I have liv 'd with the Prisoner ever since last Christmas . He keeps a Lodging-house next Door but two to the Hay field , the upper End of Rag-fair , and he has a Child that I look after in his House . I went to see a Friend , and staid out with the Child all Night at one Mr. James 's in Belton street , St. Giles 's . The Prisoner came there next Day , to see for us , and between Six and Seven next Evening we were coming home down the Strand , and there being a Crowd of People , he endeavour 'd to push along , to make Way for me , and the Child who was asleep in my Arms . I had hold of his Arm at the same time , but I let it go in the Crowd , that he might push through . At the same time I heard a Cry of Stop Thief , and stood still a little while , but having lost the Prisoner in the Crowd , I went home , and next Morning I heard - he was in Trouble . George Carlow . I know the Prisoner to be a Neighbour of mine . - I have known him between six and seven Years ; he keeps a Houses and I never heard but that he had a good Character , and is beloved by his Neighbours , - He 's a very civil Man . Mary Travis . I have known him between six and seven Years ; he has been a House-keeper in one Parish for some time , and now he keeps a Lodging-house , and as far as I have heard , he bears a good Character . He kept the Ship in Bowl-Yard , and The Plough and Harrow in St. Thomas 's street , and now he lives at the other End of the Town . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9.

The Prisoner , with a Man who belongs to a marching Regiment , came to my House , to take a Lodging , and the Prisoner went up Stairs with me to look at a Room ; my Watch happening to hang at the Bed 's Head , she desired me to put my Head out of the Window , and call the Man ( who came with her ) that he might likewise see the Lodging . What 's your Husband 's Name said I ? O says she , you need only call - Corporal . I did so , and while I was going to the Window , I saw her go to the Bed 's Head . After I had called - Corporal , he came up to the Top of the Stairs , but she pushed him back , and told him , the Room would not do . I followed them down Stairs , and they had not been gone long , before a Thought came into my Head , that perhaps I had lost my Watch . I went up Stairs , and saw 't was gone . Upon which I searched after the Corporal , and found him , and by his Means we took the Prisoner ; and she owned , she had sold the Watch to a Man at the Star-Inn , in the Strand I never got it again ; it was sold for nineteen Shillings , to one George Steward , who belongs to the Train of Artillery .

Martha Hopkins . On the 5th of November , at Night , I happened to be out late ; and about half an Hour after Twelve I went into Gaffney 's House , seeing the Door open . - He lives in Goldsmith 's Alley , in the Coal-Yard , the Back-side of Holborn , and sells Liquor . I never was there in my Life before , but I staid there till Five o'Clock in the Morning : And between Four and Five the Prisoners robbed me of two Guineas , three Half-guineas , and nine Shillings in Silver ; The Woman ( Johnson ) held me , while Mackartney took the Money out of my Bosom . I resisted as much as I could , but Mackartney spirted a Mouthful of Gin in my Face , and abused me very grosly . Gaffney stood by me all the time , but he did not touch me , and I was afraid to speak for Fear of my Life . As soon as they had got all my Money , they all three went to an Ale-house , and left me alone in the House . Jury . How came you to be out so late that Night ? Hopkins . One Mary Smith came to see me at my Lodging at Mrs. Furlong 's , in Longditch , Westminster , and I had been to see her Home ; she is Servant in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields . I did not know the right Way back again , so I enquired of a Watchman , and he bid me keep strait along . It was then very cold , and I had had an Ague and Fever upon me , and began to grow very ill , so I asked the Watchman , where I might have a Glass of Liquor , so he directed me to this House , and the Door being open , I went in - into the lower Room , - a publick Room , and drank a little . Gin there . I intended to have gone home that Night , but I was seized with a violent cold shaking , soon after I got into the House . When I first went in , there were a great many People drinking Gin , but they all went away ; they said they were going to Billingsgate . I did not know I was got into such a Den of Thieves . The other People sat with me round the Fire , and drank with me : But they were gone when the Prisoners robbed me . Mackartney told me ( when he took my Money ) that I had best be easy , else he would knock my Brains out . I heard a Watchman coming by , at the same Time , and I made all the Noise I could , but they made a greater , to drown mine , and so he did not come in . I staid two Hours alone in the House , after I was robbed ; then I went ( crying ) out of the House , and saw two Soldiers ( about Six in the Morning ) I told them I had been robbed , but they went on . I enquired where I might find a Constable , and a Stranger coming by , directed me to Mr . Hull , and I told him the Truth . I am a marry 'd Woman : My Husband is on Board the Graston Man of War , at Spithead . The Reason of my having so much Money about me , was because I had no Place else to put it in , and I thought 't was safest in my Bosom . The Maid with whom I went home that Night , is gone to Bath . I went no further with her , than the Corner of the Alley , where they sell Shoes , ( Turnstile ) Henry Gaffney . This Woman came into my House , in Goldsmiths-Alley , about Twelve O'Clock at Night , tho 5th of November , and asked what we sold ? Mackartney told her , she might have a Glass of good Gin ; and so she sat down by the Fire , and called for a Dram . Then she put her Hand in her Pocket , and drew out her Purse , and gave me half a Guinea to change . I sent Mackartney out to get Change ; he came in again , and gave her nine Shillings , the rest she had spent . Between Four and Five , Mackartney fill 'd his Mouth with Gin , and spirted it in her Eyes ; then Johnson held her , while Mackartney took the Purse out of her Bosom - 't was a yellow and white Purse . He empty 'd it into his Pocket-Apron , and threw the Purse in her Face , after he had put a few Half-pence into it , instead of what he took out . She complained immediately of being robbed ; but he asked her where she should get so much Money to be robbed of , and turned her out of Doors . She got in again , and we all went to Harry Green 's Beer-house , in Cross-Lane , St. Giles 's , where he shewed me two Guineas , three Half- Guineas , and nine Shillings . One Guinea he changed , and gave Johnson fifteen Shillings , and I had fifteen Shillings myself . He gave me a Guinea , and I gave him a Crown out of it , to make up the Change for Johnson . She had half a Guinea , and the rest in Silver . When he was before Colonel Deveil , the Constable searched him , and found the Change in his Pocket-Apron , in my Presence . Before we had divided the Money equally at Green 's , Mr. Hall came in and took us , so I got no more than fifteen Shillings . Johnson . Ask Gaffney , Whether the Woman did not come in without Stockings , and whether he did not lend her a Pair , to keep her Legs warm ? And whether she did not give him half a Guinea to serch a Gallon of strong Beer , and if he did not come in again and say , 't was a bad Half-Guinea ? Gaffney would have put it off , at another Alehouse , but the Woman , to prevent Disputes , gave him another to fetch the Beer . Gaffney I never saw the Woman before that Night , with my Eyes : Nor do I know whether she had Stockings on , or not . She gave me half a Guinea , but it was a good one ; I gave it to Mackartney , and he having a bad one before , swore 't was the same the Woman gave me . Hopkins . I had Stockings on when I went in ; and borrowed none . John Hull , Constable . The Woman ( Hopkins ) came to my House , in Bow-street , Bloomsbury , on the 6th of November , between Six and Seven in the Morning , crying : She said , she had been robb 'd , and believ 'd she could find the People who had her Money . I went with her to the Coal-Yard , and from thence to Harry Green 's , where I found Gaffney and the two Prisoners very much in Liquor . I told them , a Robbery had been committed among them , but-O they knew nothing of it , - not they , - and they all swore to it . Hopkins charg 'd me with Mackartney and Nan Johnson , so I took them before Mr.De Veil , and left Gaffney behind , but Mr. De Veil ordered him likewise to be brought , so I went back and took him . Mackartney told me , he had borrow 'd two Guineas of Green , and I asked Green before his Face if it was true ? Green said , no , he had not loat him a Parthing . We searched him , and found 17 s. and some Halfpence , in his Pocket Apron , this is the Money . Upon Nan Johnson we only found some few Half-pence , but as we were carrying the Prisoners to Newgate , Green 's Son brought her five or six Shillings . Gaffney was made an Evidence , but what he said to Colonel De Veil I know not , for he was taken backward when he made his Confession . Mackartney , This Money was my Creditors , 't was none of mine . Mr . Hull . He told us , he owed one Mr. Collier , a Distiller , for Liquor ; and Mr. Collier said it was true ; but he did not say this was his Money . He gave him a bad Character , and said he should be glad to have what he owed him . Johnson . When I went to Gaffney 's , this Woman was secting by the Fire , smoaking her Pipe , without Stockings ; she called for half a Pint of Gin ; then for another , and made six or seven People drink who were in the House . It snow 'd , and was very cold , so Gaffney said , - my dear , you 'll catch cold ; how come you out without Stockings ? Why my Landlady and I have quarrelled , said she , and I never can lie a-bed when I am in a Fret . Then Gaffney bid her pay the Reckoning , ( it came to 10 d. ) and he told her he would not trust . Do you think , said she , that I have no Money ! I 'll have a Gallon of Beer , and out she pulled half a Guinea from her Purse , and Gaffney gave it to Jemmy Mackartney , to fetch the Beer . Jemmy came back , and said it was bad Money , and the Woman gave him another . Then Gaffney lent her a Pair of Stockings , which affronted her , and she said she 'd sit without . Gaffney swore before the Justice , that I picked Seven-pence Half-penny out of her Pocket , and she laid no more than this to my Charge . Hopkins . I charged her before the Justice , with taking Four-pence Half-penny from me . I would be within Compass . She picked my Pocket of Four-pence Half-penny , just before Mackartney took my Purse . Mackartney . There was one Carolins , and Nan Beaver , and several others in the House beside us ; and the Woman was asleep by the Fire-side , when I went out for the Beer . When I came back again , she had lost her Money . As to Gaffney , - He 'll swear a Cat 's a Cucumber ; he wants Bread , and would steal a Morsel from a Cat . Gaffney . I took this Mackartney in , as a Partner with me in selling Liquors . The House is mine : I took it about three Months ago of Mr. Hilliard , and am to answer to him for the Rent ; but on his coming in Partner with me , he was to pay half the Charges . Hopkins . I am sure 't was all the Money I had in the World . I came up about a Fortnight before , from Bath , and had worked hard for it , at Chairing and Ironing . My Husband left me , and went a-board a Man of Wat , because he and I had a few Words . Both Acquitted . 28,29,30 . + James Shields , Charles Spinnel and Thomas Dent . of Paddington , were indicted for assaulting . Joseph Read , and Elizabeth his Wife , and Elizabeth his Wife , on the King 's Highway , putting them in Fear , & c. and taking from Joseph a fore Quarter of Mutton , val.18 d. and twenty Shillings in Money , and four Shillings in Money from Elizabeth , the Goods and Money of the said Joseph , Nov. 18 . They were a second Time indicted for affaulting James Marlow , and Mary Marlow , Widow , putting them in Fear , and taking from the Person of James 18 d. and 18 d from the Person of Mary Nov 18 . First Indictment . Joseph Read . I am a Higler . On the 18th of November , between Three and Four o'Clock on Sunday Morning , as I was riding in my Cart from Clare-market , and going home to Wemly-Green , in the Parish of Harrow , two Men came up to me first , and another Man immediately after them . Shields had a Pistol in his Hand , and Spinnel ( the old Man ) had a great Stick : I did not see any thing the third Man had . Shields bid me deliver my Money , or he would kill me ; he and Dent said they would turn our Cart Bottom upwards , and would smother us in the Ditch . The third Man was present at the same Time , and my Wife was in the Cart at the farther End . I gave them to the Value of 20 s. and they took likewise a fore Quarter of Mutton . They took some Money from my Wife , but I did not see what it was . Shields was the Person that had my Money ; upon his threatening me , I toss 'd it into his Hat ; but at that Time Dent was gone to Marlow 's Waggon , which was a little Way from us . Jury . Was it dark or light ? Read . It was not very dark , for I could see them very plainly . When they had got my Money , they went to my Wife , and took what they could form her : Then they bid me go on , and they went to ( assist ) the other Man who was at Marlow 's Waggon . Jury . Which of the Prisoners took the Mutton ? Read , Charles Spinnel , the old Man . Marlow 's Waggon was about the Breadth of this Court before us , till they turn 'd us out of the Road . I can positively swear , that first and last , all the three Prisoners were with us . The two young ones I never saw before that Time , but the elderly Man ( Spinnel ) I had some knowledge of , - I had seen him before . We made an Outcry , and somebody heard us , for they were taken the same Morning ; a Gentleman happen 'd to come by , he heard us , and got Assistance , so the Prisoners were taken directly . Some of the People who had taken them , came after me , - I was got about two Miles from the Place where I was robb 'd , - and they told me , the Men were taken ; upon which I came back to Paddington , where I found Spinnel and Shields ; they were taken together , but Dent was not taken till Sunday Evening . Money was found upon the two first , but how much , - I ca n't say . The Pistol , the Stick and two Knives , were likewise taken from them . Elizabeth Read . I am Wife of Joseph Read : As my Husband and I were travelling home in our Cart , one of the Prisoners [ Dent ] stopp 'd us , another of them stood at the Copses of the Cart , and the third Man stood behind the Cart . Shields damn 'd me for a Bitch , and bid me give him my Money , so I took it out of my Pocket , and flung it into his Hat ; 't was about four Shillings he had from me . After this they swore they would over-turn the Cart , and I said , - Pray , Sir , do n't over-turn the Cart ! pray do n't do us any Hurt , - you have got our Money ! then the elderly Man ( Spinnel ) who was at the Tail of the Cart , told me , they would not do us any Hurt . This was between Three and Four o'Clock on Sunday Morning , and there was Marlow 's Waggon just before us at the same time . I can take a safe Oath , that the three Prisoners are the Men , for 't was light enough for me to see them . I did not go back to see the Prisoners when they were taken ; the first Time I saw them was a Fortnight after , but I am positive they are the Men . James Marlow . I was coming from Clare-Market ( at the same time ) with my Waggon : I was asleep in it , and a Boy was driving it along before Read 's Cart . We were stopp 'd first , and the Noise they made at the Boy wak 'd me . I saw the Prisoners , Shields and Spinnel , at Read 's Cart , the other kept at my Fore-wheel . I saw them at his Cart , and hend them threaten Read , but I was so fritt ( assighted ) that I do n't remember what they said , nor can I say whether Read gave them any thing , or whether they took any thing from him . Shields and Spinnel were taken about Five or Six o'Clock at Paddington , which is half a Mile nearer London han the Place where we were robb 'd , and I saw them after they were apprehended . Spinnel own 'd the Fact , and said , the Man in the Cart told 'em , he hoped they would be merciful , because he had just lost a Horse ; he mention 'd the Money taken from me , but I did not hear him say what he had taken from Read . Dent stood at the Wheel of my Waggon , and damn 'd me , and told me , he had a good Mind to cleave my Brains out with his Stick , and I thought he would have dash 'd my Brains out , so I shut my Eyes , and am not so positive to him as I am to the other two . He ( Dent ) is like the Man , and I believe him to be one of the Three : He kept swearing at the Fore-wheel , and said , he would break all my Baskets and Hampers to Pieces . It was so light when they met us , and I saw the other two so plain , that I knew them the Minute I saw them again ; but I could not be so positive to the other . Mary Marlow . I was then traveling home in the Waggon with my Son , and saw Shields and Spinnel go to Read 's Cart . I do n't know what they took from thence , but I heard them say , they would overturn his Cart , and would kill them , if they could ; and after they had stopp 'd him , they drove it out of the Way , in order to throw them over into a Ditch . I heard them tell Read and his Wife , - if they did not give them more Money , they would throw his Cart over ; and Read told them , he had given them all he had . Shields and Spinnel were two of them , but I am not so positive to Dent . William Newman . As I was going home the 18th of November , about Four o'Clock in the Morning , I heard Marlow ( the Woman ) cry out in the Road , - do n't kill me , I have given you all the Money I have in the World . Upon this I went up towards the Cart from whence the Cry came , and saw a Man stand with a Pistol in his Hand , and heard him say , - Damn you for a Bitch , if you say a Word I 'll blow your Brains out . This was on Westbourn Green , about half a Mile beyond Paddington . I knew the Woman before , and then knew her Voice , so I intended to have rode up to her Assistance , and to have knock 'd the Man down , but seeing the Pistol I retreated , and rode to Mr. Godfrey 's ; but I could not get in there , so I went from thence to Mr. Russel 's at Paddington , and call 'd them up : A Watchman happening to come by at the same time , I likewise spoke to him , and bid him get another Man , for a Robbery was committing on Marlow 's Waggon . As soon as Mr. Russel was got up , he and I , Joseph Greenfield and George Harrison , took the Horse way , and we agreed to take different Ways when we came to the Ponds ; but we had not gone on above a Pole , before we met three Men all together by the Ponds on Paddington-Green . It was pretty dark , so I call 'd out , -Who 's there ! No Answer being given , I turn 'd my Mare , and kept close to the two hindmost , and call 'd out , - Knock 'em down ! shoot 'em dead , if they offer to resist ! Spinnel and Shields were immediately taken ; and I told Mr. Russel , I saw three of them , and ask 'd him , what was become of the third Man ; he told me the third Man was under his Gun , and , says he , if he offers to get away , I 'll shoot him . I got off my Horse , and laid hold of Spinnel , telling him , if he offer 'd to wag , I 'd knock him down : He had been knock 'd down before , and he desir 'd me to let him get up ; but I assur 'd him , if he offer 'd to wag one Jot , I would down with him again , because Russel was at a Distance from us , keeping Dent under his Gun . At the time we took Shields and Spinnel , a Quarter of Mutton dropp 'd on the Ground , but I can not tell which of them dropp 'd it . He who was under Mr. Russel 's Gun got away , but Shields and Spinnel we secured , and brought them to Mr. Russel 's House , where Shields own 'd the Robberies , and told us , the third Man 's Name was Dent ; Spinnel likewise confess 'd the same . Dent was afterward taken ( the same Day ) and I saw him , and heard him desire to be made an Evidence before Colonel De Veil . Both Spinnel and Shields ( when they own 'd the Facts ) mention 'd particularly the robbing the Cart and the Waggon ; and Shields said , the Man in the Cart desired him to be merciful , for he had lost a Horse but just before . The Pistol was taken from Shields , and this Club from Spinnel . Robert Russel . Mr. Newman rode into my Yard at Paddington , and call 'd me up , and told me , he had seen some People robbing Mr. Marlow 's and Read 's Carts . He knew both Parties , so he desired my Assistance to take the Men . He said , he heard one of them swear he would blow Mrs. Marlow 's Brains out , which gave him Reason to believe they had Fire-arms , else he would have assisted them then . Upon this I call 'd my Man Harrison , and one Greenfield to assist us ; and we agreed that Newman and I should take the Horse way , and the other two the Foot-way , if we did not meet them by that time we came to the Ponds . Before we came to this Place , we met them at the Turn-stile , coming on the Green . Mr. Newman was before us , and it was dark ; but I perceiv 'd his Horse stop , therefore I imagin 'd he saw somebody ; whereupon I levell 'd my Piece , and ask 'd , Who 's there ! Newman cry 'd , these are the Men , attack 'em ! knock 'em down ! shoot 'em ! Greenfield and Harrison immediately push 'd by me , and caught Spinnel and Shields ; and Greenfield call 'd out , and told us , one of them was slipp 'd away . I said I saw him , in order to 'fright him , tho ' I did not see him , and that I would shoot him if he attempted to get off . Mr. Newman then got off his Horse , and knock 'd down Spinnel , telling him , he would knock him down again , if he would not be quiet ; and I pull 'd my Garters off , and ty 'd his Hands . I am sure Spinnel and Shields are the Men we then took , for before we went off the Spot , we had a Candle and Lanthorn , by which we look 'd at them . I told them then , that we took them on Suspicion of a Robbery , and they then made little or no Defence ; but when we had got them to my House , they confess 'd they had committed a Robbery , and said it was the first Fact they ever had committed . I ask 'd Shields the Name of the third Man who had escaped ; he told me , - Dent , and gave me Directions to go after him to the Coal-yard , to his ( Shields 's ) Lodgings . Accordingly Greenfield and I went thicher , and enquir 'd of Shields 's Wife , ( who is Dent 's Sister ) where Dent was ; she told us , he had been there about two Hours ago , but was gone . Shields having directed us to Dent 's Lodgings , ( if we should not find him in the Coal yard ) we went according to his Notice , first to Golden-Lane , and then to an Alley in Whitecross Street , and to several other Places , but could not find him . At last we came back to Shield 's Wife , and told her , if she would tell where Dent was , it might save her Husband : Upon this she told us , he would be in Newtoner 's Lane in the Evening , and when he did come there , she got one Smith , a Constable , to apprehend him . John Smith , Constable . I took Dent in a Cock-loft , under the Roof of a House , where he had conceal 'd himself , flat upon his Face , with his Arms extended , in Newtoner 's Lane . A Man in the House discover 'd where he was conceal 'd , by pointing to the Place with his Finger , upon which I got hold of him , in the Cock-lost , and jump 'd down with him ten Feet , into the next Room . Having heard of this Robbery at Paddington , I sent to let Colonel De Veil know that I had got the third Man : He orderd me to bring him before him , add there he desired to be admitted an Evidence . Mr. Harrison was present , and having Spinnel 's s great Club in his Hand , he ask 'd him , if he knew any thing of that Stick ; yes , says he , 't is the old Man 's Spinnel 's . Marlow ask 'd him , if he was not on the Top of his Waggon last Night , and if he did not tye his Horses together with a Piece of Cord ; he said , no , he was on the Side of the Cart , and only ty 'd the Horses on one Side of the Cart . Shields . What these Men accuse us of , is wrongfully , I will give you my Word . We had been out to see for Work that Night , and having met with two or three of our Trade , they gave us some Beer , and we being be-lated were making the best of our Way home , when we met these Men , and it being dark , we did not see them till they were just upon us , and one of them catch 'd fast hold of me . Dent . Mr. Russel clapp 'd the End of his Piece directly against my Breast , and told me , if I stirr 'd he would shoot me , but I ran away , and was afterwards taken by Mr. Smith the Constable . Spinnel . We had been out to see for Work , and having Maid drinking till it was late , we were making the best of our Way home when these Men met us . They seiz 'd Shields , and knock 'd me down twice with an Iron Bar . You may see how they us 'd me . William Hanning and Mary Squire never heard of Shields 's Dishonesty before . George Robinson said , the Prisoner Dent us 'd to buy Bread and Cheese at his Shop in Long-Lane , while he was employ 'd in building Booths in Smithfield , and he took him to be a very honest Man . Mr. Russel . I took the Pistol from Shields that Night to the Dark . This is the Pistol ; 't is loaded with Shot and Powder . When we had him in the Publick House , we searched him , and found 4 s. and Sixpenn'orth of Halfpence , in one Pocket , and sixteen Pence three Farthings in another . The Jury found all the Prisoners Guilty , Death , Second Indictment . James Merlow . I know two of them verywell , Shields and Spinnel . They wak 'd me with swearing at the Lad that drove my Waggon . Shields came first up to me with a Pistol , and swore if I did not deliver my Money , he would blow my Brains out . I said , indeed , Sir , we have no Money ; but he swore he would kill me , so I put my Hand in my Pocket , and gave him 17 or 18 Pence , in Halfpence . Then the other Man ( Spinnel ) came to me , and said I had more Money , and if I did not deliver it , he would beat my Brains out with a great Club , which he had in his Hand . This is the Stick ( as near as I can guess . ) Upon Spinnel 's threatening me , I gave him two or three Halfpence more . Then they went to Read 's Cart ; and one of them told me , as they were going away , if I did not bring more Money the next time I came , they would kill me on the Spot . The other Prisoner ( Dent ) is like the third Man , but he never was so near me as the other two . He came by me with a Stick in his Hand , and threatened to dash my Brains out , so I shut my Eyes , and did not see so much of him . He asked me if I had a Watch about me , or any Geese in my Baskets or Hampers ? I told him no , I had nothing but the Cloths . The Man that kept at the Fore-wheel of the Waggon , search 'd my Boy , and took away a Tinder-box from him . I asked Dent when he was before Col. De Viel , what he had done with it ? and he told me it was good for nothing , and therefore he had thrown it away . Shields and Spinnel were taken about an Hour after the Fact , and Mr. Newman came after us , to let us know they were in Custody . I went Home and took a Horse , and came back directly ; and as soon as I saw them , I said they were the Men who had robbed me . I said so then , and so I say now . Shields took the first Money from me ; then Spinnel came with Oaths to me , and I gave him the rest . I do n't know what they took from my Mother ; but when I saw Spinnel , he confess 'd , and told me what Money he took from me . Mary Marlow . I know Spinnel and Shields very well ; I am sure they are the Men : I knew them the Minute I saw them again . I was at this Time in the Waggon with my Son , but I put my Head out to talk to them . They demanded my Money with great Oaths , and I gave them what I had - two Sixpences , and the Value of Six-pennforth of Halfpence . They damn 'd me , and asked me if I had no more ? I told them I had no more . They said they would have more , or they would blow my Brains out . I assur 'd them I had given them all I had about me ; and then they went their way , and said , D-mn their Eyes , if we did not bring more Money with us the next Time we came that way , they would blow our Brains out . Joseph Road . When my Cart was robbed , Marlow 's Waggon was just before . The Prisoners first went to him ; then they came to my Cart , and afterwards went to his Waggon again . I do n't know whether any Money was given them out of the Waggon , but I heard them swear they would kill them , - they would blow their Brains out . The three Prisoners were then all together . I am sure they are all the same Men . Joseph Greenfield , George Harrison , and Mr. Smith , the Constable , gave the same Account ( as in the former Trial ) of the manner in which all the Prisoners were taken , and of their Confessions . The Jury found them Guilty , Death . 31. Sarah Liddiard was indicted for stealing seven Pair of Worsted Stockings , val . 2 s. 6 d. three Linnen Aprons , val . 1 s. and five Towels , val . 10 d. the Goods of Ebenezer Nevil , Nov. 2 .

John Butcher was indicted , with Thomas Horrabin and Richard Stevens , not taken ) for stealing forty-seven Pieces of Elm Timber , val . 50 l. the Goods of Robert Edridge , Nov. 19 . Mr. Edridge . I sold a Parcel of Elm Timber some time in September last to one Richard Walter for 150 l. he gave me 30 l. down , and gave me several promissory Notes for the rest , which became due at different Times . When two of the Notes became due , I found I could get no Money . At last Walter and the Prisoner told me , if I would go to a Coffee-house , and say that Walter had bought so much Timber of me , and had paid me honestly for it , I should be paid my Debt in four Days : Butcher solicited me to do this , and Walter was with him , and said , he could have Credit for 300 l 's Worth of Timber , if I would say so . I refused to do it , unless they would pay me ; and finding they had bad Characters , I took out an Attachment against the Timber , had it appraised , gave Security to the Sheriffs , and then I carry 'd the Timber to Nine-Elms . in a Barge : I saw it in the Barge myself . After this it was taken away , and carry 'd to Westminster Horse-ferry . Counc . We own the Timber was taken away . Eldridge . Being informed that the Prisoner was concerned in carrying it away , I went to him , and he told me he had bought it . Henry Attersley gave an Account , that the Prisoner and Mr. Horrabin employ 'd him to serch the Timber from Nine Elms , by virtue of a Search Warrant . That one Richard Stevens was with them , who call 'd himself an Attorney , and the Witness ( being encouraged by Promises of being well paid ) assisted in bringing the Timber from Nine Elms : He said , this was done openly , Men being at Work on the Wharf , and 9 s. was paid for Wharfage . It appearing to be rather a Trespass than a Felony , the Prisoner was Acquitted . 35. Thomas Horrabin was indicted ( as above ) and Acquitted : And the Court granted him a Copy of his Indictment . 36.

Roger Life . Last Saturday Night I lost nine Sheep , out of a Field in the Parish of Acton , five Ews and four Wethers : They were all mark 'd with R. L. the Letters standing cross each other , and a Dot on the near Shoulder . They were found on Monday , in the Possession of one Simmonds , a Butcher , in Smithfield : Five of them were kill 'd , and four I saw alive , with my Pitchmark on them : I know they are mine . Simmonds told us he bought them of the Prisoner , and when we took him up , he offer 'd to make us any manner of Satisfaction . I ask 'd him if he had nobody with him , to help him to get the Sheep out of the Ground ? He told us , no ; he had no body but himself . Prisoner . Ask Mr. Life if he and his Son did not at first say the Sheep were lost on Sunday Night ? Life . My Son will give an Account that he saw them , and told them on Sunday . Prisoner . You have said they were lost on Saturday Night . Life . No - we follow 'd them on Monday Morning to Smithfield , and there we found them . The Prisoner lives about half a Mile from the Ground where these Sheep were kept : He looks after Sheep there . John Stevenson . I live with Mr. Life . On Sunday Morning I told 53 Sheep in the Field : On Monday Morning Nine were missing : I follow 'd the Marks of their Feet Half a Mile into the the Road , and concluding they were gone to Smithfiels , I went thither , and found Mr. Simmonds killing one of them : I knew it , and asked him , if he had any of them alive ? He said yes , and shew 'd me four mark 'd R.L . the Letters across , and a Dot on the near Shoulder : I found likewise five of the Skins there ; all of them had the same Marks : I could discover by the Skins , that there were five Ews and four Wedthers . Simmonds told me he bought them all of the Prisoner ; upon which I went to his House , and charg 'd him with having sold our Sheep , and he offer 'd to make any Satisfaction that my Father-in-Law desired . He did not say he took the Sheep , but when I ask 'd him if he had any one with him when they were taken , he said no , there was no body but himself , and he said he had sold them to Simmonds . Prisoner . He said he measur 'd the Mark of the Man 's Foot in the Field . Stevenson . I did so : And as I brought the Prisoner along , I measur 'd his Foot : The Prisoner 's Foot was a little longer than the Mark in the Ground ; but the Ground being slippery , his Foot might draw back . Samuel Simmonds . I bought five Ews and four Wethers of the Prisoner : They were all mark 'd R. L. the Letters cross each other , and a Dot on the near Shoulder : He sold them to me as his own ; and he has often come to Market with Sheep : He had eight more , with these which I bought ; but they were mark 'd with his own Mark . Richard Rutt , Richard Hughs , Hubert Frampton , and Joseph Lawence , spoke to the Prisoner 's Character . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 43 : + James Meredith , was indicted for stealing a Silver Pint-mug , value 35 s. and a Silver Spoon , value 7 s. the Goods of William Deane , in his Dwelling-house , Oct. 17 , Mr. Deane . I keep The Cross-keys Tavern , in Cornhill . I lost a Silver Cup , which I value at 35 s. and a Spoon , worth 7 s. I missed them on the 17th of October in the Evening ; and I have a Servant here , who saw them that Evening , in the Room where the Prisoner sat . This is the Cup , and this the Spoon , and they are mine The Spoon is broke in two , but I swear 't is mine . Prisoner . I would ask this Witness , if he has any Personal Knowledge of me ? Mr. Deane . No : I have none . Gabriel Sleath . I am a Goldsmith : On the 18th of October , about Nine in the Morning , I bought the Spoon of the Prisoner : It was broke in two , just as it is now . I gave him five Shillings and Five-pence an Ounce for it ; it came to 10 s. 7d . and I gave him half a Guinea and a Penny . I asked him no Questions , for 't was broke , and not fit for any Thing , but to melt . I never saw the Prisoner before that time . Samuel Wood . I am a Goldsmith : I bought the Cup of the Prisoner , the same Day Mr. Sleath bought the Spoon , - 't was the the 18th of October . I gave him 5 s. 6 d. an Ounce , and I think it came to 36 s. 9 d. I did not ask him how he came by it . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man I bought it of . John Lord . I am a Servant to Mr. Deane . The Prisoner came to our House , on Wednesday the 17th of October towards Evening , and called for a Drawer . I shewed him into a Room we call the Nag 's Head . He bid me bring him half a Pint of Mountain . I drew him the Wine : He drank a a Glass , and then asked me what he had got in the Larder ? I told him several different Things , at last he chose a Whiting . It was dressed , but it did not please his Palate , - it was not over and above good , he said ; - so he ordered a poached Egg or two , after he had eat about half the Whiting . I was about the House , and was not at the clearing away of the Things , but I can swear the Cup was brought to him with small Beer , and the Spoon , I believe , was carry 'd in with the Whiting . When he called to pay , I told him 15 d. He gave me a Guinea , which I changed , and he gave me 3 d. out of 18 d. for myself . When I went in to him , about the Reckoning , I observed him to be writing upon a Piece of blotted Paper , and he seemed to lean his Head from me . I wo n't be too positive to him , but I think : have seen him several Times before . I can swear he had on the same Wig , and as near as I can guess , the same Coat . He was at our House between Five and Ten , and I missed the Things about an Hour and a half after he was gone . Prisoner . I would ask him whether he is certain he ever saw me before ? Lord I think I have seen him at the Mitre Tavern , where I served my Time . I told him last Sunday in Newgate , I had seen him there ; and he said , to be sure , Sir , you have . Prisoner . I would ask him if he was the Person that took the Things away ? Lord . No : When I took the Reckoning of him the Things were all taken away , and the Table brushed clean . There was nothing then upon it , but a Half-pint Decanter , a Decanter of Water , and a large Water Glass . Prisoner . I am not the Person that conveyed the Things away from Mr. Deane 's House ; and that is the Substance of what I have to say . The Indictment is laid for a Silver Mug , and they swear to a Cup . There , my Lord , is a manifest Distinction . Mr. Fruchard . Last August was twelve Months , I was in Want of a Book-keeper , and the Prisoner apply 'd to me , and told me he came from a Place called Kimlade in Worcestershire , and shew 'd me a Recommendatory Letter from a Gentleman of the Law , - one Mr. Massey , of Shessinghurst . I told him , I should be glad to have a Line from that Gentleman , and he accordingly wrote me a Letter , and gave the Prisoner a good Character : So I took him upon Trial , and he behaved with me , in a very decent Manner , and I thought him religious . He continued with me , but a little while , - about six or seven Weeks , for he had wrote an Essay on the Divine Attributes , ( which in some Peoples Judgement , was a very good Piece ) and other Poetical Pieces ; and I found when he should have been about my Books , his Imagination was in the Clouds . This was the only Reason I parted with him . He has received Money for me , and brought it justly to Account . It is a Par-dox to me , that the Author of such Pieces , as he has wrote , should be an Hypocrite . I would have served him since he he went from me , had I not been obliged to tell him ; that his Inclination to Poetry would disqualify him from Merchandizing . Daniel Chapman , William Price , Daniel Stacey , Mary Halley , and Richard Cecil , gave the Prisoner a good Character . Guilty , 39 s.

The Prisoner was my Servant ; and Quantities of my Brass have been taken out of my Shop at several Times ; 7 lb . I found at one Mr. Jeddory 's and Ironmonger , in St. Giles 's . This is the Brass , and I swear to it . Jeddory . I bought 7 lb . of the Prisoner , and gave him 8 d. a Pound . We sell it again for 9 d. to the Founders . Rawson . I gave 15 d. a Pound for it myself . Another . I am Servant to Rawson , and was accidentally drinking with Jeddory , and he told me , and he told me , he had bought some new-cast Brass , which he believ 'd was not honestly came by . I desired to see it , and I went to his Shop , and saw it , and knew it to be my Masters . I saw 54 lb . and he told me , he had several Hundreds of it , which he had bought in small Parcels . This Brass is my Master 's , and he must give 15 d. a Pound for it , if he was to buy it himself . Jeddory . I bought it with an Intent to catch the Thief : The Prisoner 's Wife used to come with a little Bit now and then . I did not pay for the last Parcel , but went to look for the Thief , and thought I should find him out , by going among the Trade , and describing the Patterns . My Son bought the last Parcel , and told Mr. Rawson 's Servant of it . Guilty . [ Transportation .

Last Thursday , as I was going to London , with another Farmer , between Whetstone and Barnet , I was attack 'd by two Men . The first that came up I knew : What , Master Thompson , said he , wo n't you give me the Way ! then the Prisoner came up , with a Pistol in his Hand , and said , - What Money you have I will have ; so I gave him my Money : You have more , said he ; I told him I had no more , and turn 'd my Pockets out : Well , you have got a Whip , I 'll have that . When they had done with me , I went to the Mitre at Barnet , and sat there an Hour and half ; then I was told , that the Prisoner was taken with the Whip upon him . This is the Whip , and 't is mine . Thomas Miller . One Mr. Palmer was riding Post , and was attack 'd near Mimms-Wash , by two Men . The Post-boy , as he came by , told us Mr. Palmer had been robb 'd , and there the two Men went that had robb 'd him . I and my Fellow-servant assisted in pursuing them ; and on Finchley-Common we saw them , overtook them , and seiz 'd them . When I came up to them , the Prisoner pull 'd out a Pistol , and said he would shoot me through the Head : I had a long Gun , and told him , If I dy 'd , he should die . Upon this he put his Pistol up , and I threw down my Gun , and run in upon the Prisoner , and seiz 'd him , and held him till my Assistants come . This Whip he had in his Hand at the same Time . Herbert Palmer . I was present when the Whip was taken upon the Prisoner : I think it the same . We took a Pistol from him at the same Time . Rotheram . The Prisoner took my Money first , and then my Whip . I am sure he is the same Man . It was between Eight and Nine in the Evening : the Moon shone very bright , and I took particular Notice both of him and his Horse . Prisoner . I never robb 'd any body of a Farthing in my Life , and the Whip I found near Barnet . A Witness . The Prisoner lived with me ( at Times ) several Years . I have intrust 'd him with Money , and never sound him dishonest . Another . He has work 'd for me several Times , and I have intrusted him to receive and take Pounds for me ; he always used me and my Customers very handsomely . Another . I know him from a Child ; his Father and Mother were very honest People , and I never heard any thing amiss of him . Another . I have known him a Dozen Years , and never heard of any Dishonesty by him . Another . I have known him seven or eight Years : He was my particular Acquaintance . He serv 'd the Bricklayers as a Labourer ; I never heard of his being dishonest . Another . I have known him from his Infancy , and never heard that he ever behaved dishonestly till now . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty , Death * . * A Man tried for Felony , and found Guilty , in one Country , if it appears from the Evidence to be a Burglary , or a Robbery , committed in another County , the Felon is deprived of the Benefit of his Clergy . + He was a second Time indicted for stealing a Gelding of a Roan Colour , val 5 l. the Goods of Thomas Atkinson , Nov. 26 .

And the Indictment farther charged , that he the said Loglin Rennells , afterwards , viz . on the 22d of October , with Force and Arms , unlawfully and feloniously hired and retained Arthur Jackson , to enlist and enter himself to serve the King of France , ( he being a foreign Prince ) as a Soldier , without Leave and Licence first had and obtained under his Majesty 's Sign Manual . In contempt of our Lord the King , & c. & c. He was a Second Time indicted ( as above ) for procuring Richard Moore to enlist and enter himself as a Soldier , to serve the King of France , & c. And the Indictment farther charged him , with hiring and retaining the said Moore , with Intent to cause him to be enlisted as a Soldier , to serve the King of France , & c. First Indictment . The Council for the King having opened the Indictment , and the Nature of the Offence , the Witnesses were called ; and at the Prisoner 's Request , were examined a-part . Arthur Jackson . I am a Centinel in the Second Regiment of Foot-guards , and was born at New-castle upon Time . The Day before War with Spain was proclaimed , I was in Bowl-Yard , - you had better let me begin From the First of it . Counc . Do so , Jackson . I happened to be drinking at The Hog in Armour , in Field-Lane , and there was a Man forced his Discourse to me very much , seeing me a Soldier . He did not then tell me who he was , or what he was , but he asked me many Questions about military Affairs , and I resolved him to the best of my Knowledge . He told me he was an Irishman , and had travelled thro ' Ireland and France , and asked me where I lived ? I told him , at the Sheep's-Head-Shop , facing the Gulley-hole . He took it down , and shewed me his French Pass ; but he might as well have shewn it to a Horse , for it was in another Language , and I did not understand it . I asked him his Name ? He told me Ryan ; I told him I could read that in his Pass , and that was all . He put his Pint of Beer into mine , and we drank together . He was mighty complaisant , and gave a good Account of the military Affairs in France . We had five Pints of Beer together , and he would pay the Reckoning ; he would not let me club towards it . After this , in a very complaisant Manner , he made Motions for me to go with him to another Place , and I went with him to Bowl-Yard , in St. Giles 's . There he called for Two-penny , and looked upon me very pleasantly ; but upon his going out of Doors and whispering other Fellows , I suspected him to be a French Officer . We drank four Pints of Two penny , and he seem 'd pleased with me , and told me he would call upon me To-morrow . Accordingly he came the next Day and wrapped at my Door . He was then full of Complaisance : he took off his Hat , and shewed his French Behaviours , and Mr. Jackson ( says he ) will you please to go drink with me at The Hog in Armour I told him , no : I had Work to do , and should disoblige my Master if I went . Then go and speak for two Pots of Beer , and we 'll have them here . No , I told him , I did not chuse to drink ; it would get into my Head , and I should neglect my Work : If you have any thing to say to me , sit down and say it . So he sat down , and talked again very much in Behalf of the Character of France ; and I told him , I believed he was a French Officer , and was come over here to get Men . Yes , says he ; will you go ? I did not intend to go , but I told him I would , and that I had an Acquaintance would go with me . He said , if I had , he should be glad to drink with him , and I promis 'd to bring him , as soon as I saw him . After this , I went to Lunard Armstrong , and told him , a French Officer had been with me , who wanted Men for the French Service , - for a Company of Fusiliers , which lay at Calais . I said , I did not understand it ; therefore I desired him to speak to somebody upon this Affair , and in the mean time I would give the Fellow Encouragement to come to my Room . The next time I saw Armstrong , I asked him if he had enquired about this Business ? The Fellow comes , says I , and pays me Visits , - I want to bring him to Justice , and if I bring him to The Old Baily on my own Evidence , he might bring twenty People against me , - yet I do n't care to smother such a Thing : Ryan was then out of Town : He went to carry off some Men , and was gone four Days . When he returned , I told Armstrong ; so he , and Richard Moore came to my Room , to hear farther into the Affair , and I desired Moore to go with me to strengthen my Evidence . Accordingly we all set out for Bowl-Yard ; my Wife was unwilling I should go , and she followed us up Holborn , and there I troubled Armstrong to keep her in a Public House , while Moore and I went to Ryan 's in Bowl-Yard . When we came to the House , I asked the Maid for Mr. Ryan , she said at first , she knew no such Person ; but when I told her , I was the Person that had been drinking with him , she knew me , and said she would go and fetch him . When she came back , she said , she had not seen him , but she gave me a Tap on the Shoulder , and bid me come to the Door . I did so ; and she there asked me , if the young Man that came with me ( Moore ) was to go to France too ? Yes , says I , he came with me for that Intent and Purpose , if we can see Mr. Ryan . She told us , she would bring a Man to us , who was going off To-morrow : I approved of it , and so she fetched the Prisoner at the Bar into the Passage , and told me that was the Man . The Prisoner shook Hands with me , and said , - Mr. Jackson , I know your Business . I am sure he is the Man that enlisted me ; I know him by his Phisiognomy , and the deep Scar in his Forehead . He called me by my Name , and said the Maid had told him my Business , and ask 'd me if I was willing to go ? I told him , yes ; but I came to speak with Ryan . Why , says he , I 'll give you as much Encouragement as Ryan , or any body else ; and I have as much Power to enlist Men as he has , or any belonging to the King of France 's Service . Upon this , I called Moore , and the Prisoner shook Hands with him , and ask 'd him , if he was willing to go ? Moore said yes , if he liked his Proposals , then he asked us to go up Stairs , and we went up one Pair of Stairs , and sat down at a Table ; we drank a Quartern of Gin , and a Pint of Two-penny , and there being three Beds in the Room , and a Man lying in one of them behind us , I pointed behind me with my Thumb , to let the Prisoner understand , I feared the Man abed would hear us : But he told us , he was one of our Sort , and we might talk what we pleased . While we were talking , another Man came into the Room , and undross 'd himself , and went to Bed . The Prisoner knew him too , and told us , he was one of the same . We then told him , we were willing to have gone with Ryan ; and the Prisoner said , we might as well go with him , for he would give us as much Encouragement . He talked much in the Character ( in Praise ) of France , and took Moore to the Back of the Door , and the Maid told us , - that was the Place where the Men were measured . The Prisoner took a Knife out of his Pocket , and having set himself against the Door , he put the Knife ( over his Head against it , and he was not so high as the lowest Mark of the Small-coal him-himself . He held the Knife still , and called Moore to stand under it , and Moore was not so high as the Prisoner , by I know not how much , - two Inches I believe . After this , there was another Man came up into the Room , that neither the Prisoner nor we knew , and then he said - I do n't care that any body should know my Business , so we went to the Stair-head , from behind the Door . There Moore asked him , what Bounty-Money he gave ? Says I , I suppose he 'll give us twenty Crowns , for Ryan proposed to give so much . The Prisoner told Moore , he could not give him so much , but he would to me , because I was a sized Man ; however he would give him fifteen , tho ' he was fit for nothing but a Drummer . Then says Moore , what Pay are we to have , when we come there ? - I do n't know but the Pay might be talked of , both at the Table in the Room , and at the Scair-head . - The Prisoner told us , our Pay would be Five-pence Half-penny a Day ; which , with other Advantages , would be as good as a Serjeant 's in a marching Regiment . Why that 's a good Place , says I ; and Money will go twice as far there , as it will here . I told him , I expected another Soldier every Minute , who was willing to go with us , and asked him ; what I must do for Cloaths , for I had no other than what I had on to go in . You 'll go , says he , in a Ship , and will not be seen ; 't is as dangerous for me as for you : You may take your Gun and Accoutrements with you , - you 'll never be seen . Counc . Did he propose to go with you himself ? Jackson . Yes , he proposed to go off with us the next Day , and was to give us a Note of his Hand for the Money on board of the Ship , which ( Note ) was to be paid us by the Cornet , when we came to the Regiment . The Money was not to be paid in England , and Moore question 'd the Payment of it in France ; upon which the Prisoner took two Shillings out of his Pocket , one he gave me , and the other to Moore , and said , - You 'll as surely have it as you have this , - by G-d . This is to inlist you to serve the King of France . After this we went in , and sat down , and drank the rest of our Liquor , and he drank the King of France 's Health , but I drank no Health at all , nor would I , had he insisted on it , though I gave him his Way as much as I could that Night . Counc . How long did you continue together ? Jackson . We went in a little before Eight at Night , and we continued together till past Eleven . When we came away , we went to Colonel De Veil 's to acquaint him with the Affair , but he was gone to Bed . I had inform 'd Armstrong of it the second Day I was in Company with Ryan , - ( I ca n't tell : he Day of the Month ) - in order to have him apprehended . Counc . Did you go to Col. De Veil the next Morning ? Jackson . I went home to Bed that Night , and toward Morning Armstrong and Moore , with Newbury and Brough , called me out of Bed : I came down to them in a Minute or two , and went with them up Holborn , as far as Hatton-Garden , with my Stockings in my Hand , and there I put them on , and asked Moore if he had got a Warrant for the Prisoner : He said , no , we may take him without . I told them , there was no Occasion for all this Haste , and that if we went before Day-light , 'twould be but beating the Bush , for the Birds would all fly aways so we went to a House in St. Giles 's and staid till 't was Day . Then we got Sticks , for as we had no Arms , and there was so many Beds in the Room , I thought we should stand a Fagg . Moore went first , to see if the Prisoner was in the House ; I follow 'd in a Minute or two , and he informing me the Prisoner was a bed , I went back to give our Friends Notice , and then I return 'd to Moore . He seeing them pass by the Door , went out after them , to se , where they would wait till we wanted their Assistance . But I went up Stairs , and desired the Prisoner to get up and drink with me : He raised himself up , and took his Breeches from under his Head ; but the Maid having seen the Soldiers go by the Door , she came to me , and asked me if I knew them ; I told her , no , I did not ; however she went to the Bed-side , and spoke something to the Prisoner , in another Language , upon which he immediately look 'd angry and sulky . Moore was now return 'd , and came up Stairs , and the Prisoner lay down again , and said he was sick . Then Moore said he should be glad to get a Rowl and Butter ; I told him I would go and get him one , and having given him a Tap on the Shoul der to get him to the Room-door , I bid him not quit the Room till I came back ; so away I went to Newbury and Brough , who follow 'd me to the House , and when I got up Stairs again , the Maid was in the Room , and shut the Door ; but when I saw the Red-coats coming up Stairs , I turn 'd the Lock back ( being stronger than she ) and let them in ( Newbury , Brough and Armstrong ) and told them , that was the Man who had inned us into French Service , and the Maid having told me , that one of the Men in Bed was to have gone with us , we took him and the Maid too , and carried them all to the Bear Ale-house , till Col. DeVeil was stirring ; but she made her Escape , and the Man was discharged . While we were waiting there , a Thought came into my Head , and I bid them take Care the Prisoner dropp 'd nothing . We had ty 'd his Hands , and he desired they might be loosen 'd ; after which his Pocket-Book was taken from under the Table . I forgot to tell you , that while the Prisoner was talking with Moore and me at the Stair-head in his Lodging , he told us , we should have new Cloaths , and two Shirts , not so fine indeed as what he had on , but two good strong Shirts . Counc . Did not you go with the Prisoner before Col. De Viel ? Jackson . Yes , we all went , and the Man was committed . Prisoner . Ask him if I went by the Name of Macguire . Jackson . After we got out of the Coach , when we carry 'd him to the Gate-house , there was a Woman who abused us , and called him Macguire . Others call 'd him Macguire too . Prisoner . Did I name any Regiment in France ? Jackson . He told us , we were inlisted into the Duke of Berwick 's Regiment . I am positive of that . Prisoner . Did I give you the Shilling above Stairs , or below ? Jackson . As the Stair-head . Moore had the first Shilling , and I the next , and he told us we should have the rest as sure as we had that , - by God . Lord , I wonder to hear him talk so . Prisoner . Was I in this Dress at that Time ? Jackson . I ca n't be positive to Dress . I am positive he 's the Man that inlisted me . He had while Buttons , - metal Buttons , on both Sides of his Waistcoat [ The Prisoner had a Waistcoat on him at the Bar , with such Buttons as the Witness described . ] Richard Moore I am a Scotsman , - a Shoemaker . I know the Prisoner . I saw him on the 22d and 23d of October last , at a House in Bowlyard , about Eight o'Clock at Night . 'T is not a publick House , - they sell Gin and Twopenny in a cland stine Manner . Jackson and I went there the first Night , about Eight o'Clock , and Jackson asked for Ryan ; a Woman told us she knew no such Person , but when he told her he had drunk Twopen y and Gin with him there , then she said she knew him , and would go for him . She went out for a little while , then she return 'd , and gave Jackson a Tap on the Shoulder to follow her . He went to the Door with her , and came back to me She went out of Doors , and in a short time the Prisoner and she came in together . Then she gave Jackson the second Motion to come to the Door , and he call 'd me to him there , where the Prisoner shook Hands with me , and asked me if I was willing to go to France ? I know the Prisoner is the Man though I saw him but twice , 't is impossible I should not remember him , for he has a great Scar in his Face . - I told him I did not know but I might be willing to go Then let 's go up Stairs ( says he ) and drink together . There was a Pint of Twopenny and a Quartern of Gin brought up , and he commended France , telling us how much it exceeded England , and what Encouragement there was to serve the French King . He did not dispute Jackson 's Size , but he did mine , and took a Penknife out of his Pocket , and stuck it over his own Head in the Door ; then he desired me to come under it ; he scrupled my Height , but said I was a likely young Man , and would grow . - I have forgot some Part of my Story . - There was one Man a-bed in the Room , and another came in and undress 'd himself , and went to Bed ; the Prisoner told us , he was one of the same , and would be no Detriment to us . After I was measured , in came a third Man , and then the Prisoner beckoned us out to the Stair-head , and asked us again , if we were willing to go to France . Says Jackson , Ryan promised to give twenty Crowns , - you 'll give no less , to be sure . No , says he , I ca n't give you so much , ( meaning me ) - you 're not so tall as Jackson ; I 'll give him twenty , but I can give you but fifteen . and you shall have two new Shirts a-piece , and shall be new cloathed from Top to Toe ; you 'll have 5 d. Halfpenny a Day , which , with other Advantages , will be as good almost as a Serjeant in a marching Regiment in England . Jackson then told him , he had no other Cloaths to go in , but the Cloaths he had on ( Soldiers Cloaths ) ; the Prisoner said , he had a Ship provided to his Mind in the River , and he would not be examin 'd , so he might bring his Gun with him , as well as the rest of his Regimentals , because they 'd be of Service to him on the other Side of the Water . Jackson told him , he expected another Soldier every Minute , who would inlist likewise , to which the Prisoner reply 'd , - So much the better - the more the merrier . I asked him , how we should be sure of the Advance ; he said he would give us a Note for it , when we were got on board , and we should receive the Money when we were come to the Regiment . I was scrupulous , and desired the Money before ; he told us , he could not do that , but ( putting his Hand in his Pocket ) he pull 'd out two Shillings , one of which he gave first to me , and then the other , - to Jackson . I asked him what the Shilling was for ; to inlist you ( says he ) to serve the King of France , and you are as sure of the rest of the Money when you come there as you are of this . - by God . I think he told us , we were to serve in the Duke of Berwick 's Regiment then , - I am sure he told us so before . After this he shook Hands with us , and call 'd us Brother-Soldiers . This was on the Stair-head . Then we went into the Room again , and he drank the King of France 's Health : I did not drink it , nor do I remember that Jackson did . We drank a little more Gin and Twopenny together , and about Eleven o'Clock we left the Prisoner , and went to inform Col. DeVeil of the Affair , but he being gone to bed , we went and drank a Pet together in Drury Lane ; then Jackson and I parted , and I went and lay at a Friend 's House . About Five or Six in the Morning , Armstrong ( who knew where I was to lie ) came with Newbury and Brough , and knock 'd me up : He told me , he had acquainted the Captain of the Tilt-yard-Guard with this Matter , and I must get up , and go with them . We went and knock 'd up Jackson , who came out to us with his Stockings in his Hand , and did not put them on till we came upon Holbourn-Hill . I had desired the Prisoner not to lock his Door when I left him over Night , for ( I told him ) I would only go and fetch my working Tools , and would return to him ; but thinking that if the Door should be lock 'd , our knocking at it so early would make a Discovery , I propos 'd going to drink a Pot of Beer at a House where I was acquainted ; but they not being up , we went to another , and asked for Arms , but they could provide us with none but a Mopstick saw 'd in two . Then I went to see if the Prisoner 's House was open . The Maid ( who first brought the Prisoner to us ) told me he was above Stairs I had not talked to her above two Minutes , before Jackson came in , and I believe we had a Dram together ; and the Persons who were to assist us following Jackson , he made a Motion with his Hand to prevent their coming in , so they pass 'd the Door , and I follow 'd them , to see where they went in . Before I went after them , the Maid asked me , if I knew those Soldiers ? No , really ( says I ) I do n't . But under Pretence of going for a hot Rowl and Butter , I follow 'd them , and bid them be easy till I came , or sent for them . When I came back to the House , Jackson was gone up Stairs , and I went up to him . The Prisoner was in Bed , and he seem 'd before to be willing to embrace us ; but the Maid coming up , and speaking something to him in an unknown Language , ( Irish , I suppose ) tho ' he had his Breeches in his Hand , he put them under his Head , and laid himself down again , seeming much out of Humour , and to be very much startled . After this , I said , I believe the hot Rowls are come from the Bakehouse by this Time , be so good ( speaking to Jackson ) as to fetch me one . He tapp 'd me on the Shoulder ( to get me aside ) and bid me not quit the Room till he came back . Jackson , under this Pretence , went and told our Men . He return 'd in a Minute or two , and the Maid followed him up Stairs , very much surprized ; then he peep 'd through a Crevice in the Door , and seeing the Soldiers coming up Stairs , she and he struggled together at the Door ; but he got it open , and let them all in . They immediately asked us , who gave us the Money to serve the King of France ? I told them , - the Man that lay next the Wall : Upon which they bid him get up , for he must go along with them . The Appearance of Soldiers affrighted him , and he got up trembling ; and both he and the Man abed with him , were bound with a Cord , - their Hands behind them . After they were pinion 'd , I proposed carrying them before Colonel De Viel , and the Maid likewise . Prisoners and Assistants were now Nine in Number , and we all went together to a publick House , to wait for Colonel De Viel 's rising : And remembering I had seen Papers in the Prisoner 's Window wrote in French , ( I am sure they were not in Latin , for I understand something of that ) I said - Gentlemen , search him , - may be he has Papers about him , which may strengthen our Evidence . They did not think proper to search him till he came before a Magistrate , so I bid them take Care that he dropp 'd nothing ; but after Colonel De Viel had sent word he was ready for us , the Prisoner , by some means or other , got his Hands into his Pocket , and dropp 'd something like a Book or a Letter-Case . I desired to see what he had dropp 'd , and it was pick 'd up by Newbury , ( I think . ) He shew 'd it to Brough , and I look 'd ever him while he was reading it . 'T was French ; and Brough told us 't was a French Conge There was a Seal to it , and to the best of my Knowledge , this is the very Paper . I took Notice of the Spelling the Name - Loglin Rennells . I must be very much mistaken , if this is not the ver same . It was produced before Colonel De Viel ( I think ) by Newbury , and the Colonel asked the Prisoner if his Name was Loglin Rennells ? and he told him , Yes . Is this your Pas Yes . What had it you for ? To come to England , to see my Friends . Why did you drop in ? He said any body might drop a Paper accidentally Prisoner . Did you ever see me before that Night ? Moore . Never in the whole Course of my Life , - o my Knowledge . Prisoner . Did I go by any other Name ? Moore . I do n't know . The Woman was asked as we went along with them , what his Name was ? and she said , Macguire . Prisoner . Do you know any thing of Ryan ? Moore . No . From Jackson 's Words I expected to have seen Ryan there that Night ; but this Prisoner appeared in his stead , and was very fond of the Job : He said he could do as much , or more , for us , than Ryan ; that he belonged to a better Regiment , and had better Quarters . Prisoner . Did not you strip yourself , to shew you had been whipp 'd on board a Man of War ? Moore . Yes , I did . I wo n't deny a Word . When I was on board a Tender to a Man of War , I got under the Denomination of having been an Informer , and was whipp 'd for having the Name of an Informer . Leonard Armstrong . Jackson having inform 'd me , a Man wanted to enlist him into foreign Service , I took an Opportunity to go down with Moore to Jackson 's Lodging . Jackson was willing to go with us to the Man , but his Wife made words with him about it , telling him he would bring himself into Trouble . When we went out together , she followed us into Holborn , and then Jackson desired me to go to a publick House with her , and if I could , to leave her there , and come to them in Bowl-Yard . I did so , and between Ten and Eleven at Night I got to the House , and asked the Maid , if there was not a Soldier and a young Man there ? She said yes , and I was let in , and saw the Prisoner and the two Witnesses there . I know his Face , and remember that great Scar . His Coat I ca n't swear to , but he had then on a Waistcoat with whitish Buttons on both Sides . The Prisoner was surprized when I came in ; but Jackson told him , he need not be surprized , - this ( says he ) is the Soldier I spoke of , who is willing to go as well as we : Upon which he seemed content . I ca n't say there was any Health drank , while I was there . I had not been long in the House , before Jackson 's Wife came to the Door ; Moore and he went to her , and while they were at the Door with her , the Prisoner said to me - I understand you are willing to go ; I have enlisted them , and if you 'll go with them you may : I do n't know but I may go off Tomorrow . I asked him what Encouragement he 'd give ? You 'll have , ( says he ) Five-pence Half penny a Day , to serve in the Dake of Berwick 's Regiment , and other Encouragments . I asked him if he gave the Money down ? No ; he said , he had been bit before . I could not have any more Talk with him , because Jackson 's Wife kept making a Noise at the Door , and I was afraid , the Thing would , by that Means , be blown . So I bid him good Night , and we went to Colonel De Veil 's ; but he was abed , so we parted , and I went and acquainted Newbury and Brough with what had passed . They insisted on my acquainting the Captain of the Guard ; and I went to him , but he did not think proper to send Men from Guard , without an Order from Kensington , so we went ourselves , as soon as it was light , and took him ourselves . He was abed , on the farther Side next the Wall . He behaved civilly , and pretended Innocence . Counc . Did not you carry him to a Publick-house , before you went to Colonel De Veil ? Armstrong . Yes : and there somebody propos 'd to search him : One more knowing than we , said , may be he has a Conge about him . The Prisoner complaining he was pinioned too hard , I eased him , and presently Moore ( I think it was ) cry 'd - he has dropped something , and Newbury took up the Letter-case , which was produced before Colonel De Veil . Prisoner . Was Jackson with you , when you first came to me , in the Morning ? Armstrong . Yes ; we called on Jackson , and not he on us . When we were all together , we went to St. Giles 's to get Arms , but we could not be supplied . Then we sent Moore and Jackson to the House , who were to give us a Signal , when to come in . When we came there , the Woman seemed to have locked the Door , but Jackson opened it , and we went in . Benjamin Newbury . After the Prisoner was taken , we carry 'd him to a Publick House , where he was observed by Moore to drop something , after the Proposal was made to search him . We looked under the Table , and I picked up this Letter-case , and gave it to Mr. Brough , who opened it , and took out this Conge ; then he put it in again , and gave the Letter-case to me ; and I produced it before Colonel DeVeil . Moore never had it in his Possession at all . Hagher Brough . I was at the taking of the Prisone , and knew him by the Cut in his Forehead . We carry 'd him to a Publick-house , and there Moore observing him to drop something , Newbury took up the Pocket-book , and gave it to me unopened . I having once been trapannca in to France in the same Manner , I opened it , to see for his Conge , which I found , and it was left in the Hands of Colonel DeVeil . Colonel DeVeil . After these Men had made their Depositions before me , in the Manner they have now done , this Paper was produced to me . I read it , Word for Word to the Prisoner , in French , and he acknowledged it was his Pass . 'T was produced to me , as a Paper which he had dropped . I asked him , why he dropped it ? He said , a Man might drop a Paper by Chance . I asked him , if Loglin Rennells was his Name ? and he said it was . The Paper was read , in English , as follows . BERWICK 's Irish Regiment of Foot . Leave of Absence . We who have signed , certify to all whom it may concern , that we have given Leave of Absence , to one named Loglin Rennells , Voluntier in the Company of Hadden , in the Regiment of Berwick , born at Kilshore , in the Province of U ster , aged 23 . Five Feet three Inches and a half high : Chesnut Hair ; blue Eyes ; his Mouth of a midling Bigness : large Face , a little marked with the Small Pox , and a large Cut on the left Side of his Forehead . Signed , Dated 18 N.S . C. 1739 . 7 O. S. BARRY , Lieut . Col. STAPLETON , Major . Colonel DeVeil . I can take my Oath , this is the same Paper which was produced to me . DEFENCE . William Barret . I am the Man who came in and undressed myself , and went to Bed . I lodge in this House , in Bowl Yard : I came home from Work about Seven o'Clock , and this Soldier , ( Jackson ) and the Shoe-maker ( Moore ) there . The Shoe-maker enquired for a Man , but neither of them could tell his Name . The Woman knew who they wanted , by the Description they gave of him , and she told them his Name was Ryan . When the Prisoner came in , the Shoe-maker told a Story about his being whipped on board a Man of War , and said he wanted to be enlisted . Says I , they wo n't take you , - you are not tall enough . Well , says the Prisoner , what have I to do with it ? If you will go , you may ; I know nothing of the Matter , - I 'll have nothing to do with it ; but the Shoemaker was urgent to go , and said if the Prisoner knew any Body that would take him , he should be glad . After they had been some time in the House , they and the Prisoner went up Stairs ; and I went up some time after to Bed . The Shoemaker was urgent , above Stairs , to get into the King of France 's Service , and the Prisoner said , - If you 'll go you may , but I 'll not advise you to it . Counc . Did not you see the Prisoner measure him ? Barret . No ; nor I do n't remember his carrying them out of the Room to the Top of the Stairs . They staid in the Room till they all went down together . They had a Dram , I believe , in the Room , but when the Reckoning came to be paid , the Prisoner had no Money , but went o'score for his Dram . They staid in the Room about an Hour , and I was awake all the Time . I had no Curtains to my Bed , nor did I lie with the Prisoner . I am a Carpenter , a labouring Man , and was to rise early the next Morning , but their Talking in the Room kept me awake ; - indeed I did not endeavour to compose myself to Sleep , but I was willing to sleep if I could . I lay with my Eyes open all the Time , for I hearkened to their Talk , and could hear them as plain as if I had been nearer them . Counc . Did you hear any Healths drank ? Barret . No , none at all , as I heard , - really I did not hear the King of France 's health drank . I have lodged six Weeks in the House ; there are three Beds in the Room , and I lay in a little one by myself . Counc . How long had they been above Stairs , before you went up . Barret . Not above ten or twelve-Minutes . I went to Bed between Eight and Nine , and they staid in the Room three Quarters of an Hour afterward . Timothy Reynolds . I am not akin to the Prisoner , but I was at this House , in Bowl-Yard , the 22d . of October , at Night . When Jackson and Moore came in , I was sitting by the Fire : They asked the Landlady for one Ryan ; she told them , he was not there then , but if they 'd call in the Morning she 'd let him know , they had been there . The Witnesses drank a Pint or two , before the Prisoner came in ; And then somebody spoke of a Soldier who had been in a Foreign Country , and the Shoemaker ( Moore ) said he wanted to go abroad ; he shewed us his Back , and told us he had been whipped on Board a Man of War ; swearing he would go any where to get his Bread , rather than ever go on board again . Then they asked the Prisoner about going to France ; but he said he would not encourage them to any such Thing , - they might go if they would . After this , they went up Stairs for half an Hour , or better ; what passed there I ca n't tell , for I was not in their Company above Stairs . Counc . Did you lie in the same Room with the Prisoner ? Reynolds . No ; I lay up two Pair of Stairs , and he lay up one Pair . Counc . When Jackson and Moore came first and enquired for Ryan , did she offer to go and fetch any one else to them ? Reynolds . No ; not as I know of . Counc . Did she go out of Doors after they came in ? Reynolds . I can not say whether she did or no . Counc . How long were they in the House , before the Prisoner came into their Company ? Reynolds . About a Quarter of an Hour : They had drunk two or three Pints of Two-penny , and some Gin , or Anniseed , or Wormwood-Cordial . Counc . Did the Maid and the Prisoner come in together ? Reynolds . I can not say , - but during the Time they were waiting for Ryan , she was in the Room , - she remained in the Room till the Prisoner came in , except the Time she was drawing their Liquor . - I ca n't say whether either of the Witnesses went out with the Prisoner , when he came in , - or not . Counc . Did the Prisoner know either of the Witnesses ? Reynolds . No : But the Shoe-maker was drunk and made a Noise , which I suppose was the Reason the Prisoner took them up Stairs , and the Woman of the House was then sick . James Sommers . I have made Hay with the Prisoner in July last , ( for Want of better Employment ) at Mr. Lewis 's , in Tyburn-Road . In October he lodged at a Chairman 's , - an Acquaintance of mine - in Bowl-Yard , who sold Liquors in his House . We did not make Hay together above a Week , - none in October ; but I believe I have drank with him once at this House , - I believe it was in October , - I can not be positive - I ca n't tell whether he paid his Reckoning , but he had Credit in the House , if he had no Money . The chief thing that I came here for , was ( as he told me ) to swear that his Name was Rennells , and not Ryan . Counc . Can you tell upon your Oath , where the Prisoner was , between the Time of Hay-making and October ? Sommers . I ca n't indeed . He told me in Hay-making-time , that he had been in France to see an Uncle , and that he intended to go there again that Summer . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty , Death . The Evidence upon the Second Indictment , was the same , as in the preceeding Trial . And the Jury found the Prisoner Guilty , Death . 57. Elizabeth Bradshaw , of St. Sepulchre 's , was indicted , for that she not having God before her Eyes , & c. on the 10th of November , in and upon Richard Challenger , feloniously , & c. did make an Assault , and with both her Hands , in and upon the Breast of the said Challenger , violently and feloniously did push and thrust ; by Means of which Pushing and Thrusting , He the said Challenger was with great Force thrown to the Ground , and by the said Fall , received on the Back-part of his Head , a mortal Bruise , of which he languished from the said 10th of October to the 11th , and then died . She was a second time charged by the Coroner 's Inquest , for feloniously slaying the said Challanger . Elizabeth Tranter . I lived three Weeks with the Prisoner ; the Deceased had lodged in the Prisoner 's Cellar about five Years . He used to sell Greens about the Streets o'Mornings , and Fish o'Nights . On Saturday Night , November the 10th , he came Home between Ten and Eleven , - I believe 't was between Eleven and Twelve , and the Prisoner said to him , - So Dick , - Where 's the Ten-pence Halfpenny you owe me ? Says the Prisoner , - Mrs.Bradshaw , I ca n't give it you To-night , but if you 'll stay till Morning , when I have sold my Greens , by G-d you shall have it . She told him she 'd stay no longer , and if he did not pay her that Night , he should not come in ; - he should come in there no more , till he brought the Money . There are four Steps at the Door , and he was upon the Top of the Steps ; when he told her he could not pay her that Night . I saw the Prisoner ( as I was standing in her Shop , near the Door ) give him a push down all the four Steps . He stood with his Face toward her 's ; she push 'd him down backwards , and he fell down all the Steps . Then she went to Bed , and the Deceased was shut out for Half an Hour : In which Time I heard him call out , - Mr. Constable ! Mr. Constable ! ( the Landlord of the House ) is a poor Man to be murder 'd because he has got no Money ? He spoke this very faintly , and I hearing him , let him in in the dark , so I ca n't tell what Condition he was then in , but he complain 'd of his Head , and went down to his Cellar . I did not see him again till Seven o'Clock next Morning : He was then sitting upright in the Bed , with his Cloaths on ; and he had bled a vast deal ; his Shirt and Pillow were very bloody , and his Hair was matted with the Blood that came from his Head . The deceased in the Morning halloo 'd out , Thieves ! Thieves were come to rob him ! That was the Occasion of my going down : I asked him how he did ? He said he was very ill , - very cold . There was no Surgeon or Apothecary call 'd to help him , but somebody got him an Hot-pot , which he could not drink , he was so weak . There was a Woman washing in the Cellar , and she saw all this as well as I. Mr.Constable cut off his Hair , and threw it down the Vault . The Accident happen 'd on Saturday Night , and on Sunday Night , about Six , he died . I was present when he was wash 'd : A Woman who liv 'd at Constable 's wash 'd him , but she is not here . I saw his Head was bloody , and the Blood came from the back part of his Head ; but the Hair was not cut off so near as that I could see any Wound . There was no Coroner call 'd , and but one Searcher ; and when she came , Mr. Constable call 'd me up Stairs , and bid me take no Notice of the Cut in his Head . The deceased was drunk when he fell down , but not so much as to be insensible of what he said , or did ; and I do n't believe the Prisoner push 'd him down wilfully ; she did not do it with any great Force . James Powel . I have only to say , that on Saturday , the 10th of November , between Ten and Eleven in the Morning , I was at one Casey 's in the Old Bailey , and the deceased came in to fell Greens . He was then as hearty as any one in this Court ; and if I had had a Hundred Pounds to have laid out in the Insurance of any Man 's Life , I would have insur 'd the Deceased 's , in the Forenoon of Saturday , the 10th of November . I heard of the Accident at Casey 's , but I never saw him after it happen 'd . Coroner . Constable had the Management of this whole Affair : The Man died on Sunday Night , and on Monday Morning they got him into the Ground , without giving any Notice to the Coroner . But afterwards , by Direction from Sir William Billers , Mr. Robinson sent a Letter to the Coroner , who order 'd the Body to be taken up , and a proper Inquiry to be made . Prisoner . The deceased came Home between Eleven and Twelve on Saturday Night . I asked him for my Money , and swore he should not come in , till he paid me ; and I argued some time with him for it . Then I put my Hand to his Shoulder , and he turn 'd down the Steps , and tumbled . After this I let him in myself , and he went into the Kitchen , and sat two Hours by the Fire , without making any Complaint , and paid me Five Farthings of my Money . Tranter . She went to Bed , and I let the Deceased in myself . On Monday Afternoon , when the Man was buried , People persuaded me to tell what I knew of the Matter ; so I left the Prisoner 's Service that Day , and did so . Mary Belville . I know nothing of the Fact ; but on Saturday Afternoon , between Twelve and One o'Clock , I drank with the Deceased , at the Lion and Ball , the Corner of Fleet-Lane . He told me , he was not exceeding well , - not so well as he should be . I am so cold , says he , that I am like a Post . I told him , we would have a Pint of Beer , and it should be warm 'd . After which I asked the Woman of the House , if she wanted any Greens , if she did , the deceased would bring her some ? She said , he might if he pleased ; and he went out and brought her his Greens , and she bought four Savoys and six Colliflowers . On Sunday I sent to the Deceased 's Cellar for a Head of Sallory , and heard that Dick ( the Deceased ) was fuddled , and was not up . And on Monday Morning about Ten o'Clock , Mr. Constable came to my Husband , and told him , Challenger was dead . I wash 'd him , and saw a Thousand Blotches and Scabs about him , but no Marks of Blood . Tranter . She was the Woman who threw his Shirt down the Vault . Belville . No ; 't was only a Collar , which he wore round his Neck . Tranter warm 'd two Pots of Water and brought me down to wash him . She helped me to throw the Collar down the Vault . I saw no Blood on him ; but I did not examine the back part of his Head . Beata Adcock . I was present when the Deceased came Home on Saturday Night ; he was vastly fuddled . The Prisoner ask 'd him , if he had brought her the Money she lent him to buy Greens ? He said , No , - he had spent it . Then , says she , you sha'nt lie in this House to Night , till you pay me the Six-pence I lent you , and the Four-pence Halfpenny you owe in the Shop . He told her he could not , and at that Instant I turn 'd into the Back-Room , and he was push 'd down the Steps . I afterwards saw him sitting upon his Breech , on the middle Step ; I pass 'd by him to go out , and saw no Harm come to him , - but vastly fuddled he was , to be sure . Marget Atkins . I came Home ( to Constable 's House ) on Saturday Night , between Ten and Eleven , and found the Deceased sitting in the Chimney-Corner : He called for hot Drink , Tranter warm 'd it for him , and he seem 'd brisk . I sat up in his Company till between One and Two . At One , I told him 't was time to go to Bed ; but he desired to stay longer . At last he took a Candle and went down to Bed ; I follow 'd him down , to see he did no Mischief with his Candle : He stood Sea sawing upon the Stairs , and told me , he was so drunk that he could not get into his Bed . I desir 'd him to take Care of his Candle ; for , says I , if we should all be burn 'd in our Beds , - what shall we do . So I came up , and desir 'd Tranter to look after him . In the Morning , the Prisoner went down , and gave him a Dram of Anniseed . He complain 'd of no Wound given him by the Prisoner , nor did I see any Blood . Tranter . This was the Night before the Prisoner was push 'd down . Atkins . No ; 't was the very same Night . Joseph Taylor . The Deceased and I were great Acquaintance : We were Partners , and sold Fish and Greens together ; he was the first that let me into the Business . On Sunday Morning I went to his Cellar , and serv 'd Belville a Ha ' p'orth of Greens . I called , Dick ! Dick ! but nobody answering , I push 'd open the Cellar door , and went down , and found him lying stark-naked on the Ground , with his Knees up to his Mouth . I lifted him up , and put him in Bed , and call 'd Mr. Constable . He came down with another Friend , and gave him Part of a Pint of hor Liquor , with Gin or Brandy , or something , put into it . I saw no Blood on him , - there was a Scar upon his Head , just upon his Crown , - you may call it a Scratch , and I believe the Pebble stones behind him might do that , for I found him lying upon them . When the hot Pint came down , he look 'd very hard at me , but could only say , - Joe ! very cold ! - very cold , Joe ! I staid with him till Four o'Clock ; then I left him . Catherine Constable . I went down into the Cellar on Sunday Morning , and saw the Deceased leaning on his Elbow : I ask 'd him , what ail 'd him ? Mrs. Constable , says he , I am so cold , I am like a Post , - feel me ! I took hold of him , and found him very cold and chill 'd , all one Side of him . Upon which I bid Tranter give him a Glass of Anniseed , and I supported his Head while he drank it . God bless you , Mrs. Constable , said he , I am cold as a Post . He made no Complaints , and as for Blood , - I saw none . I have known the Prisoner about seven or eight Months , and never heard but that she was and honest virtuous Body . When Tranter came from the Elephant and Castle , where the Body was brought , after it had been taken up , the People asked her how she could swear the poor Woman 's Life away wrongfully ? and she said , she would not have done it if she had not been prompted to it , and if she had not done it , others would . Hester Barber . The Prisoner is an entire Stranger to me ; but I live opposite to this House : And this Tranter coming to my Shop for a Quartern of Tea , told me that Dick who sold Greens was dead . Then God rest his Soul , says I . He came in late , she said , on Saturday Night , and was so drunk he could not stand ; that he complain 'd of being cold , and drank some warm Ale : but still complaining of Cold , he went to Bed , and died suddenly ; and now my Mistress is laying him out ; and washing him : I am surprized , says she , how they can touch him , he 's all over Seabs s and Sores . She said nothing of his having been push 'd down , nor of his being bloody , but that he was a frightful Corps . John Row . I am a Surgeon . I was sent for to inspect the Body of the Deceased the Night the Jury sat on it , which was the Thursday after the Accident . Mr. Snowd sealped him , and I examined the Head and Brain . There was no Consesion through the Flesh , - only through the Skin , or in the Way of rubbing , as by a Brick ; and there were Blotches all over his Body , through the Instigation of the Venereal Disease . Acquitted . 58 . + Thomas Ward was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of Benjamin Foster , and stealing three large Tin Cannisters , val . 5s . 1 lb . and half of Green Tea , val . 5s . 1 lb . and half of Bohea Tea , val . 6 s. and 1 lb . of Coffee , val . 2 s. 6 d. two Brass Candlesticks , val . 5 s. a Brass Drudging-box , val.I s. a Brass Pepper-box , val . 6 d. a light grey-Peruke , val.1 l. and an Iron Poker , val.1 s. Sept. 15 . Benjamin Foster On the 15th of September , between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock at Night , I was robb 'd of all the Things mentioned in the Indictment . They were taken out of my Shop in Water Lane , in Fleet-street . The Shop-door was open at that Time , but the Hatch was lock 'd . Tis always lock 'd o'Nights . I was gone to Bed , but my Wife was in the Shop , at the same time ; though she did not miss the Things till between Seven and Eight the next Morning . On the 24th of October last the Prisoner came into the Shop , ( I was present at the same time ) and he asked my Wife , if she had not lost some Tea , and two Tea-cannisters ? yes . Did not you lose a Coffee-cannister , and some Coffee ? Yes . Did not you lose two Brass Candlesticks and a Drudging-box , and Pepper-box ? Yes . Did you not lose a light Peruke , and a Poker ? Yes . Was not your Money-drawer like to have been broke open ? Yes . Why then , Mrs.Foster , I am the Thief . I am not drunk ; I come to tell you that I am the Thief , and here I am , and will stay till you get a Constable . My Wife asked him , where she sat when he took the Things ; you sat , ( said he ) asleep by the Fire-side . She told him , she had rather sit down with the Loss , than have any Trouble , and so she bid him take himself away ; but he damn 'd his Eyes , and said , If you do n't prosecute me , I 'll prosecute you , and will make it cost you 40 l. he was then very sober , and wrote down an Account of the Things we had lost . Upon this I sent to see for an Officer , but we could not get one , nor find a Magistrate at home , so we let him go about his Business . On the Saturday after I took him again , and carried him before Mr. Alderman Lambert , where he deny 'd all . Prisoner . Do you know that I ever wronged any body of a Farthing ? Mr. Foster . I have known the Prisoner several Years : He is a Fellow that follows the Coal-Carts , he 's what they call a Scuffle-hunter , and lives in Hanging-sword-Alley ; that 's no very good Place . Tviphena Foster gave the same Account , with only this Variation , That she believed the Prisoner had been drinking , but he was ( she said ) compos mentis . Castle Scasebrook . I know nothing of the Robbery , but I was in the Prosecutor 's House when the Prisoner came in and made the Confession ( as above . ) He told them , They endeavoured to break open the Till with the Poker , but he would not tell who he meant by - They I asked him , if he knew what he was about ? yes . Why , ( says I ) this is a Thing of bad Consequence . I know it , ( says he ) - I shall go to New Prison . I told him , no , he would go to the Compter : But he said , he knew better , for Evidences went to New Prison , I thought it look 'd as if he intended to have made himself an Evidence . He told them , he knew he must go to Prison somewhere , and insisted on their charging a Constable with him , and would not stir out of the House till an Officer came . Upon this I went for a Constable , but the Constable told me , he was busy , and as the Prisoner came voluntarily , we might go with him ourselves before a Magistrate ; and we went accordingly to my Lord Mayor 's , and to Sir William Biller 's , but they not being at home , the Prosecutor let him go about his Business , and next Day they took him up with a Warrant . I ca n't say I ever heard he had wrong 'd any body , - only he lives in Hanging Sword-Alley with an ill Woman . Lucy Scasebrook . I was present when the Prisoner told Mrs.Foster he was the Thief ; I took hold of his Hand , and told him , I was sorry for it . He mention 'd all the Things , and said the Poker was taken with an Intent to break open the Till . I told him , - surely he was suddled ; no , he damn 'd his Eyes , - he was not : He knew , ( he said ) what he was about , and said , if they would not take him up , he would prosecute them , and make it cost them 40 l. Prisoner . I made no Confession at all , and I have Witness to prove , I was not from home that Night they were robb 'd . Her Name is Betty Ward , - but she 's not here .

Peter Thompson was indicted for assaulting Richard Cheshire , on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Silver Watch , val.4 l. a Guinea and Sixpence in Money , Nov , 14 . Richard Cheshire . On the 14th of November , between Six and Seven at Night , I was attacked on Hounslow-Heath , by a Man on a grey Horse : He cry 'd Hallo ! - Hallo ! I said again . Where are you going ? said he : What 's that to you , said I. D-mn you , said he , I know you are going to Staines ; I know you by your great Coat . I told him , if he had a Mind to have my Company , he must ride faster , and I laid my Head down , clapp 'd Spurs to my Horse , and endeavour 'd to get off , but he cry 'd , - d - mn you , if you do n't stop , I 'll shoot you dead . I made no Reply , but kept digging my Horse , and got Ground of him : He still hallo 'd out , if I did not stand he would shoot me ; and upon looking back , I saw him in the Road following me , and holding out a Pistol . He d-mn 'd me , and I d-mn 'd him , and bid him come along ; for as I was well mounted , I did not fear him . But on the Top of the Heath , my Horse cut his Legs , and could gallop no farther . I thought if I surrender 'd they would use me ill , so I clapp 'd my Gloves under my Thigh , and prepar 'd to refill . When the Man ( who pursued me ) got up to me , he turn 'd his Horse round , and said , - D-mn you , why did you ride away ? and clapp 'd a Pistol to my Mouth , which I threw out of his Hand , and then struck him off his Horse , by a back-handed Blow , with the But-end of my Whip ; then I endeavour 'd to jump on him with my Horse , and to tread his Guts out , but my Horse jump 'd over him , and another Man immediately came up , and said , - d - mn you , if you do n't surrender I 'll shoot you dead , I caught hold of his Collar , and then a third Man attack 'd me on a white-fac 'd Horse , and swore he 'd shoot me , and fir 'd off his Pistol . I d-mn 'd 'em , and said , - if I must be robb 'd , I must . They took from me a Silver Watch , a Guinea , and a Sixpence ; and the last Man who came up to me , shot me . It was dark , and if the three Men were here present , I could not swear to their Faces . While they were robbing me , a poor Man came out of the Powder-Mills to assist me , and the Man on the white-fac 'd Horse d-mn 'd him , and gallop 'd to him , and let fly , and wounded him in the Arm . After this they all got off , and the poor Man got back to the House to have his Wound dress 'd . My Bridle was cut all to Pieces ; my Coat shot thro ' , and a piece of my Shirt was shot off ; but my Bridle having a Weymouth Bit , with two Headstalls and four Reins , I took them all up in my Hand together , and as I went on , I saw a grey Horse in the Road with a Saddle and Bridle on him . He would not let me catch him , but I drove him in the Road before me to Beont , and then cried , - Stop a Highwayman 's Horse . The Horse was stopp 'd , and carried to the Black-Dog ; I examin 'd him in the Stable , and told the People I had been robb 'd , but I had given one of the Rogues a damnable Knock on the Left Side of his Head . The People of the House tell me I fainted away in the Stable ; - I do n't remember that , - but the Thoughts of my narrow Escape with Life , made me faint away twice in the House . I had not been long at the Black-Dog , before a Man came from the Prince William 's Head , and demanded the grey Horse . I said no one should have him , but the Owner : Upon which the Man went back , and the Prisoner came for the Horse , with a Knock on his Head , which appear 'd to be fresh done , and 't was on the Top of his Forehead . I thought the Horse I drove to the Black-Dog , was the same the Man who attack 'd me rode on , because it was a grey Horse , but I can not swear to it . When the Prisoner came to demand it , he behav 'd very civilly : He said , he had been robb 'd himself , and that he belong 'd to Mr.Barham of Staines . He and I drank together , and I think we spent 4 s. 6 d. or 5 s. a-piece in the House . I asked him , how he came by that Money , if he had been robb 'd ? He told me , he had lost one Guinea of his Money in London , but had found 6 s. or 12 s. ( I do n't remember which ) in his Plad Waistcoat Pocket . After we had drank together , he offer 'd to go Home with me ; but I took two Men with me , ( who rode on one Horse ) and bid them ride before the Prisoner . In sont-Lane he got past them ; I caught him again , at the Turning on this Side the Turnpike . He was to have gone with me to my House at Staines ; but when we came to the Town , he said he had borrowed a Whip at the Anchor , and must stop there to return it . I went in at the Anchor with him , and there charged an Officer with him , and had him before Sir Thomas Reynolds , where he said , the Horse and Saddle was Mr. Barham 's , and that he went from Mr. Barham 's that Morning with a Letter to London , and was to call at Brentford about some Trees which his Master had bespoke . I never went to Mr. Barham , to enquire if the Prisoner was his Servant , for several People said they knew him to be his Gardner , but I never saw him before in my Life . Prisoner . What Distance was you from this Town ( Belfont ) when you was robb 'd ? Chester . About three Quarters of a Mile , and I discover 'd the Horse without a Rider about 40 or 60 Yards from the Spot on which I was robb 'd . He was about thirteen Hands and a half , or fourteen Hands high . Prisoner . Was not the Landlord of the Black Dog , where we drank together , a Constable ? Chester . Yes ; but I did not know it then , else I should have charged him with the Prisoner then . Prisoner . Did not I tell you I had been robb 'd , and knock 'd off my Horse ? Chester . Yes , after which we spent 4 s. and 6 d. a-piece . Prisoner . Where did you first charge me with having attack 'd you ? Chester . At Staines ; I did not charge him at Belfont ; I was too much 'frighted . Prisoner . You say you went forward to Staines , and that I attempted to ride away : Had you charged me with attempting to rob you , before that ? Chester . No ; but we were to go solely , and he rode hard , and I caught him twice , and charged him with attempting to ride away : He said , he would go my Pace , to my own House , and I should charge an Officer with him . As we went along , I asked him , why he went away ; I ca n't tell what Answer he made , but the Men rode before him again , and he rode away again , - I rode after him , and then we went altogether to Staines . Prisoner . Was not my Stock torn ? Chester . He said they had taken his Stock-buckle . - I thought I saw something ragged about his Neck , - about his Stock . Prisoner . Had I any Arms about me ? Chester . I did not search the Prisoner . If he had had any Arms , he would have been a Fool to have brought them with him . Prisoner . How many Times were you before Sir Thomas Reynolds ? Chester . Three Times ; and the Prisoner attended every Time . The first Time Sir Thomas ( on Account of his being Mr. Barham 's Servant ) took Fourscore Pounds Bail , and the second Time there was 200 l. Bail given for him . Prisoner . How came you to see the Pistol in the Man 's Hand , when you say it was so dark ? Chester . The Pistol shone bright , and I saw it . I told -the People at Belfont , that I had knock 'd a Pistol out of a Man 's Hand , and that my Glove fell near the Place . A Man went out , and found the Glove , but not the Pistol . Prisoner . He said , - he had given the Man a Knock on the left Side of the Head , - the Blow I had was on the right Side of my Head . Chester . I struck the Man back-handed , and as his Face was toward mine , the Blow must be given on the right-Side . Prisoner . If I was the Man who first attack 'd him near the Powder-Mills , he says his Horse rode fastest at that time ; then how can it be supposed that my Horse could outride his afterward ? My Horse was very heavily shod , and that was the Reason of his growing resty ; but when he got before me , my Horse went better , - so will any resty Horse . Francis Sherman . It was very frosty that Night , - hard Weather , and I heard Horses galloping hard : By and by there was a Cry of Highwaymen ! Thieves ! Rougues ! Murder ! I went out , and saw a Horse shoot out of the Road ; hey , says I , you 'll break your Neck ! Stop that Horse there , says Chester , I have been robb 'd , and have knock 'd a Man off that Horse , and I believe if I have Help to go upon the Heath he ca n't get off . I stopp 'd the Horse , and before I could get him into the Stable , one Blake came up and said , - the Man who own 'd that Horse was at his House Chester said , - then let the Man come to me for-it ; so we put the Horse into the Stable , and Chester fainted away ; we got him in Doors , and he fainted away again : Then he wanted me to go home with him , and told me , he would pay me for it . But the Prisoner coming in , and asking for the Man that wanted him , I told him that was the Man , ( Chester . ) The Prisoner asked him , if he wanted him : Says Chester , I have been robb 'd ; I want somebody . So have I , says the Prisoner ; and after this they lat down , and drank together , for three Quarters of an Hour , and at last Chester told me , I should go home with him . The Prisoner said , there was no Occasion for that ; for as they were both going the same Way , and had been Fellow-sufferers , he would lose his Blood before he should be wrong 'd any more . Chester would not accept of his Proposal , but desired me to go with him , and another young Fellow who was present offering to go likewise , he got up behind me , and we all went out together . When we got to Staines , Chester took him into Custody , and the Prisoner asked him what he meant ? I assisted in seizing him , and should have done so by Chester if the Prisoner had charged him . He said he belong 'd to 'Squire Barham , but I knew not 'Squire Barham , nor either of the Persons . Prisoner . Did I attempt to get away ? Sherman . He rode away foremost very hard ; - he rode away twice , but once he made a very hard Push , - but I do n't say he rode hard with a Design to get off . His Horse could not out-ride Chester 's at fair Play ; nor did he shew any Sign of Fear at Belfont . He was all over Blood about the Head , and the Button-holes of his Stock were broke . William Roseblade . I know the Prisoner came and own 'd the Horse at the Black Dog , and seem 'd unwilling we should go home with Chester . Thomas Cheshire . I have work 'd at the Powder-Mills twenty Years , and happened to be coming out at the Gate when this Disturbance happened . I thought somebody had fell down in the Road ; and cry 'd , - I 'll come to your Assistance this Minute . I ran up to the Place , and in a Moment a Man turn 'd his Horse upon me , and said , - D - mn you , keep off , and at that Instant shot me into my Arm . I heard them cry , - d - mn you , where 's your Watch , - and d - m you , I 'll search you . I ca n't tell who they were ; I wish I could , for I have suffer 'd much by them . I saw three Men on Horseback ; two of them had got Chester between them , but I saw no grey Horse . As soon as I was shot , I went to the Mills , to get my Wound dress 'd , and the Slug came out of my Arm with a Piece of my Shirt . Prisoner . On Wednesday the 14th of November , I came from Staines to London . As I came along , I call 'd at Mr. Green 's at Brentford , about 25 Pear-trees and 25 Cherry-trees , which my Master ( Mr. Barham ) had bespoke for our Orchard . I put up my Horse ( a little grey Pad ) at the Nag's-Head in Hedge-Lane , till Four o'Clock ; then I set out on my Return home , and the Man of the Inn persuaded me to leave a Guinea ( which I had about me ) with him . I rode alone till I came to the Turnpike , and 't was terrible dark , very frosty , and no Stars . The Men at the Turnpike told me , 't was Five o'Clock , and thought I should get home by Seven . On Hannslow-Heath I heard two Men coming towards me on Horseback , but I could not perceive the Colour of their Horses : As soon as they came up to me , one of them got off his Horse , and caught hold of my Bridlo , and fil 'd their Pistols at me . I cry 'd out Murder , and wheel 'd my Horse away with all my Might ; but before I came to the Powder-Mill Bridge , they came again on my right Side , and knock 'd me off my Horse , and robb 'd me : One of them d - mn 'd me , and asked me why I rode away , and whether I imagined they rode with Broomsticks . They robbed me of fifteen Shillings , a Stock-buckle , and my Gloves : Which was all I had about me except a few Half-pence and five or six Shillings , which were in my Waistcoat-pocket , and which I saved by putting my Hand thro ' the Folds of my Coat and pulling it aside . After I was robbed , I thought to have catched my Horse , but could not ; 't was so dark , I could not see him , tho ' he never was out of my hearing . When I came to Belfont , I got a Man to help me catch my Horse , and told Mr. Blake at The Duke 's Head , that I had been robbed , and that I thought the Men who had robbed me were following me . Upon Enquiry , it was found to be only Mr. Chester , who had drove my Horse into the Town . I went to him , and we drank a Bottle of Mountain , and two Bottles of Port , as Fellow sufferers together . Then I desired to have my Horse , and said , if Mr. Chester would go home , I would go with him : He did not say whether he would or not , but asked another Man to go with him . So we all set out together , and in Belfont-lane , my Horse happened to go before theirs ; but before I got to the Turnpike , they halloo 'd me , and I stopped and answered . From the Turnpike we rode together , till we came to the Road that leads to my Master 's House ; then Chester asked me to go to the Swan ; I declined going , and upon that they seized me . They had not charg 'd me at all , before they laid hold of me . Nicholas Blake . I keep the Duke 's Head at Belfont . On the 14th of November , the Prisoner came to my House in the Evening , with his Head broke , and his Face all over Blood . I hope , says he , you are Christians , and that you 'll use me like a Christian . - I have been robbed on this Side the Powder Mills , and have been used very barbarously : My Horse is gone , pray send after it . I did so , and found the Horse was stopped at the Black Dog ; and Word was sent , that the Owner of it must come there : The Prisoner said he would go immediately . His Head was swelled ; which seemed to have been occasioned by a Blow with a Stick or a Whip ; and there was a Cut in it like a Prick with a Sword or a Bayoner . He proposed to go by himself , to Chester , but I went with him , and as soon as he got into the House , he asked who wanted him ? Chester said he wanted somebody ; and , says the Prisoner , so do I. I have been robbed , says Chester ; and so have I , said the Prisoner . After this they sat down , and drank two Bottles of Wine : I staid half an Hour with them , and then left them together . This was at a Constable 's House , and where I have seen Chester stop and drink before this Time . Sir Thomas Reynolds . Chester did not charge the Prisoner with robbing him : He only said he was robbed by a Man on a Grey Horse . He could el her swear to the Man , nor to the Horse . Mr. Barham , Mr. Musle , Mr. Sedgewick , Mr. Morrison , and Mr. Read , gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest , industrious , sober Man . Acquitted . 62 . + Anne Groom was indicted for stealing five 36 Shilling Pieces , two Moidores , and fifteen Guineas , the Money of Thomas Sparrow , in his Dwelling-house , Aug. 5 . Thomas Sparrow . The Prisoner was a Person who used to do the Business of a Chair-woman in my House . I keep my Money in a Chest of Drawers in my Bed-chamber ; and on the 3d of June last , I lost out of the Drawer six Guineas and a Moidore . The Lock of the Drawer was pick 'd , but not broke . On Sunday the 5th of August , my Wife lay dying at Brumpton , and the Prisoner being employed in my House , I went to see my Wife at Two o'Clock , and returned home at Seven . When I got home , I found two folding Doors between the Dining-Room and my Bed-chamber , ( which I had nailed up after the first Robbery ) broke open . The next Morning I examined my Drawers in the Bed-chamber , and missed nine Guineas , five 36 Shilling Pieces and a Moidore , which was all the Money I had there , except a Moidore : On the Thursday following , I took her to Task , but she 'd confess nothing . No , said she , - confess and be hanged . Upon this I turned her out of Doors , and bid her be gone about her Business . On the Sunday following I was sent for to her Lodging , and she confessed she took my Money , and to clear her Husband of being concerned with her , she owned she put the Money in his Pocket . I had lost twenty Pounds all but four Shillings . She owned taking the Money , but said it was not quite so much , and she hoped I would be favourable . Her Husband asked her , - No , do I know any thing of the Money 's being taken ? No ( she said ) I took it , and put it into your Pocket . Matthew Tead confirmed the Account of the Prisoner 's Confession . Jane Harrison . I was present when the Money was found by her Husband in the Pockets of a Pair of Breeches of his , which lay in a Chest in their Lodging . Mr. Groom found it himself , and was vastly surprised : 'T was in two Papers in the Breeches Pockets ; there was nine Guineas , a Thirty-six Shilling Piece , a Moidore , and eighteen Shillings in Silver . He sent for Mr. Sparrow , and delivered it to him , while the Prisoner lay upon the Bed , and to all Appearance was dying : For after Mr. Sparrow had turn 'd her off , on account of this Robbery , she came home , and got blooded , and having opened the Bandage , she let herself bleed almost to Death . When her Husband found this out , he sent for me , and wondering what could induce her to do such a Thing , I told him she was charged with this Robbery : He searched , and found the Money . I never heard her speak till after she was taken up . Elenor Hill . I was present when the Money was found : The Prisoner at that time had lost so much Blood , that we all thought she had been dead . I sat up with her all Night , and the next Morning she spoke : Her Husband , she said , knew nothing of the Money , but she had put it into his Breeches Pocket , unknown to him . On the Sunday following Mr. Sparrow asked her , if it was his Money ? She told him it was ; and Mr. Sparrow said , if she had owned it when he first earned her with it at his own House , he would not have taken her up . Jane Avis . I heard her own it was Mr. Sparrow 's Money . I have known her almost thirty Years . She lived at Mr. Keene 's , and at the Dutch Emony 's and with my Lord Claredon . I never heard any Harm of her before . Guilty , 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 63.

About Five in the Morning , on the 22d of October , I lost a Firkin of Butter from Dice-Key near Billingsgate : It was my Father 's ( John Denafield 's ) for whom I transact Business . After we had miss 'd the Goods , one Mr. Andrews , a Carman , came upon the Keys with his Cart , and brought with him the Firkin and the Prisoner . We always land our Butter from on board the Hoys before Day-light ; and as soon as I had landed them , I told thirty-one Firkins . In half and Hour afterward , I miss 'd one , mark 'd D.D . No.4 . My Father marks his Goods with D.D . because he has a Brother named Joseph , and if our Goods were mark 'd I.D . we should not know them from his . James Andrews . On the 22d of October , about Five in the Morning , I met the Prisoner with a Firkin of Butter on his Back , by the Postern on Tower-Hill . Hey , says I , where are you going with that Firkin so soon this Morning ? He told , me , he was going to Iron-Gate with it , in order to carry it by Water to one Jones 's at Deptford . I ask 'd him from whence he brought it ; he said he had it from Butolph-Wharf , from a Waterman . Aye , says I , but I am afraid you stole it yourself , and I bid my Man ( who was with my Cart ) get me a Candle , and when I saw the Marks , I knew it to be Mr. Delafield 's ; so I threw it up in my Cart , and took hold of the Prisoner 's Shoulder to bring him back . As we came along , he endeavour 'd to stip from me . Nay , now , says I , I find you are a Rogue , and I gave him a Polt with my Whip . When I came to Dice-Key , I found them searching for the Butter . Here , here , says I , here 's your Butter , and here 's the Thief . When he was carry 'd before Sir Edward Bellamy , he said a Waterman had given it him , to carry to a Boat at Iron-Gate , and that it was going to one Mr. Jones as Deptford . Jury . Is your Father 's Name Denafield or Delafield ? Delafield . Denafield ; I will write it down ; he spells his Name thus , D , E , L , A , F , I , E , L , D .

John Gulliford . I live at Mr. Bradbury 's , in Bishops-Court in the Old Baily . On the 27th of October , the Prisoner ( who used to go on Errands in the House ) came up into my Room with a Gold Ring enamel 'd , upon her Finger . I asked her , whose it was ? She said , it was Mrs. Renward 's . I bid her carry it down Stairs again , and put it into Mrs. Renward 's Room . She went down , and said she would do so . After this Renward gave her a Guinea to fetch her a Gill of Wine , and she not returning again , I was employ 'd to search after her . The third Time I was at her Lodging , I found her , and she had deck 'd herself up very handsomely . I ask 'd her , where the Rings were ? She told me , she knew nothing of them . As I had seen one of them before upon her Finger , I got Mr. Jones at the Elephant and Castle in Fleet Lane , to take Charge of her ; and then she acknowledged , she had taken one of them . I took her at her Lodging over against the Three Daggers upon Saffron-Hill . Mary Renward . I happen 'd to be taken ill that Day , and sent the Prisoner , with a Guinea , to fetch me a Gill of Wine . She not returning , I suspected she had done me some other Mischief , and upon looking in my Drawers , I miss 'd a Mourning Ring , and another with a Ruby and two Diamonds . Upon this I sent Gulliford to look after her : He found her , and brought her to me , and she own 'd she took my Mourning Ring , ( inscrib 'd - Thomas Frost , 1734. aged 66 . ) but did not say in what Manner , nor from whence she took it . Elizabeth Bradbury . I left the Prisoner in Mrs. Renward 's Room the 27th of October . The two Rings were then in the Drawer , but the Drawer was not lock 'd . I went out , and saw no more of her till she was taken , and then she confess 'd she had taken the Mourning Ring . Walter Edward confirmed the former Witnesses . Guilty , 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation .

Mrs. Robins . I live in Knight-Rider-Street . My House was not broke open , but the Window that goes down into the Cellar was wrench 'd , October the 8th . It was fast as we could make it , but it had receiv 'd such Damage by a Cart , that any one might get into it , provided the Bars and the Iron-work should be wrench 'd . The Bars I found wrench 'd , and I suppose the Prisoner got into my House that Way . I lost between Three and Four Pounds out of a Cupboard in the Back Counting-house . I had bolted the Door at the Top of the Stairs ( that lead into the House ) myself , when I went to Bed , but I found it open . The Counting-house Door was latch 'd , but not lock 'd . In the Morning I found the Lock upon the Cupboard wrench 'd , and it hung only by one Nail . The Prisoner was my Servant , and I suspect him , because I sent him out on an Errand that Night ' and he took the best of his Cloaths away with him . My Son , another Servant and I , sat up for him , but he did not ( as we know of ) come home that Night , and next Morning I found the Money gone , and the Door at the Top of the Cellar Stairs , and the Cupboard Door broke open , and my Money gone . My Husband at this Time was out of Town . Walter Pearce . On the 8th of October , at Night , Mrs. Robins desired me to shut up her Shop , because the Prisoner ( she said ) was gone out with Candles . About Eleven o'Clock I saw him at her Door , and told him his Mistress sat up for him : He did not care to knock at the Door , so I told him , I would . No , says he , you shall not , - I 'll get down the Cellar Window . The Iron Bars were fell so much , that any body might get down , and he said he would sit in the Cellar till his Master Franky ( his Mistress 's Son ) got up ; and so down he got directly , but I know nothing of his getting out again . He was taken about seventeen Days afterwards , and was carried before Mr. Adderman Parsons . Prisoner . Was the Family a bed when I got in ? Pearce . No ; the Clock had not gone Eleven . Madam was sitting up for him then . William How . I was one of the Persons that took him . I know nothing of the Robbery , but one Mr. Major , an Acquaintance of Mr. Robin 's , happen 'd to see the Prisoner at Hoxton ; he ran after him till he was tired , then he cry 'd Stop Thief , and I took him . Mr. Major told me he had robb 'd his Master ; to which the Prisoner made ( at that Time ) no Answer : But when we got him into Mr. Weaver 's House at Hoxton , he own 'd he had taken Three Pound in Silver , but did not mention from what Place he took it . We asked him , What he had done with it ? He said , he had spent it . We sent for his Master , as soon as we had taken him , and he asked him , how he could serve him so ? The Prisoner cry 'd , and said , he was sorry for it . John Chitham 's Evidence was to the same Effect . Acquitted of the Burglary , Guilty of the Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 72 , 73.

Pursuant to which Sentence the said Buchanan was carried to a certain Place , between the Flux and Reflux of the Thames , call 'd Execution-Dock , in order that Execution might be done upon him , Dec. 20 . At which Time they , the said Robinson and Parsons , with Force and Arms , him the said Buchanan feloniously took away , and resca 'd , before he was hang 'd by the Neck till he was dead ; against the Peace , & c. There being some Deficiency in the Proceedings to support the Charge , the Prisoners were Acquitted . 74. John Cooke was indicted for stealing ten Pair of Leather Shoes , value 12 s. the Goods of John Hicks , Dec. 3 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 87.

Lewis Currant . I pack 'd up the Plate ( in the Box , from whence they were stole ) in my Lady Charlemont 's House , some time in July last . There was a Shagreen Cafe , with twelve Silver Handle Knives and Forks , - I do n't very well know what they are worth , - about 40 s. I believe ; there was twelve Silver Spoons , worth about 40 s. more , - I do n't know the Value ; a Soop Spoon , - worth about 30 s. six Silver Candlesticks , worth 12 l. three Silver Salvers , worth 6 l. a large Cup and Cover , 10 l. a Sauce-boat , 3 l. two Salts , 30 s. a Pair of Snuffers and Dish , worth 20 s. three Casters and Stand , worth ( I believe ) 30 s. - I ca n't tell the Value exactly . These Things were carried to Mr. Benjamin Haslop 's House in Fleet-street , after I had nailed them up in Lady Charlemont 's Presence . I saw the Box afterward in Mr. Haslop 's House , but the Plate was gone . John Price , I saw the Plate packed up in a Box ; then I took it and put it into a Coach with Lady Charlemont ; it was delivered at Mr. Haslop 's and I ( myself ) carried it up Stairs into the Garret . Mr. Arthur Barnard ( Brother to Mr. Francis Barnard ) lock 'd up the Box in the Garret , and took the Key of the Door with him . About three Weeks ago Mr. Arthur Barnard unlocked the Door , and bid me bring the Box out of the Garret ; he went into the Room with me : I found the Box in the Place where I left it , but it being very light , I said , - Sir , where 's the Plate ? 'T is not in the Box . We opened it , and saw 't was all gone . Mr. Haslop . I did not know that such a Thing was lodged in my House . I knew I had several Things of Value in the House , and I heard of this Box being brought in , but I did not know what was in it . When the Goods were missed , I immediately thought who had taken them : I had great Reason to suspect the Prisoner , for he was my Apprentice , and I forced him to sue out his Indentures , ( on Account of his dishonest Practices ) when he had almost served out his Seven Years with me , and he went from my Service the 17th of September last . Last Monday was se'enight Mr. Barnard and Lady Charlemont came to my House to fetch away this Box , and the Plate was then missing : Upon which I suspected the Prisoner , and he was taken up the Saturday following , and was carried before Sir William Billers . He confessed nothing to me , but when he was before Sir William , he confessed the Fact , and his Confession was taken in Writing , but he refused to sign it . He confess 'd Abundance of these Things ; I ca n't name all the Particulars . He work 'd in a Garret next the Room in which the Plate was kept ; and he owned he begun with the Cover of the Cup , and that he hammer 'd it down upon his Lap-stone , and then knocked off the Handles of the Cup : The Candlesticks ( he said ) were the next Things he took . I ca n't say I heard him mention how he got the Door open , but he confess 'd he took the Plate out of this Garret into his Room , - the Knives and Forks , the Cup , Salvers , and Candlesticks , and had sold them to one Abraham Pope , who kept a little Silversmiths Shop , at the Queen 's Head in Newgate-street , near Grey-Fryars . He said , he had tried several Silversmiths , but not one of them would buy the Plate of him , except this Pope , and he ( Pope ) gave him 3 s. and 6 d. an Ounce for it . John Lock . On Saturday Night , the 24th of November , about Eight at Night , I was sent for to a Room up two Pair of Stairs , in a House in Hanging-Sword-Alley , in Fleet-street . Mr. Haslop had told me of the Affair some time before , and had laid wait to catch the Prisoner . When I came there , I found two Men , a Woman , the Prisoner , and Mr. Haslop , who was surpriz 'd with Joy , at having taken him . He at first would confess nothing to us : But I took him down Stairs into another Room , and in a little Time Mr. Barnard coming to us , I left him and the Prisoner together . Soon after this , Mr. Barnard came and told me , he had confess 'd . Then I took him into Custody , and in my hearing he own 'd how he open 'd the Door . He said , there was a Padlock upon it , which he open 'd with a Nail , and the common Lock , he strain 'd open with his Breech . He confess 'd he carry 'd a small Piece of Plate out first , and offer 'd it ten or twenty Goldsmiths at least , but none would buy it . At last he offer 'd it to Pope , and he bought it of him for 3 s. 6 d. an Ounce . He told us , That he afterwards carry 'd the Cover of the Cup to the same Place , and sold it him for 3 s. 6 d. or 4 s. an Ounce , - I ca n't tell which . He mention 'd the Cup , the Cover , and the Candlesticks , and said he had bruised them , and carry 'd them all at different Times to Mr. Pope . Upon this Confession , I had him to my Lord-Mayor 's , but he was not at home : From thence I carry 'd him to Sir William Billers , and he was so good as to give us a Hearing : Before him the Prisoner confess 'd all the Things , and describ 'd the Man he had sold them to , - Mr. Pope , at the Queen 's Head in Newgate street . He confess 'd all the Things in general before Pope 's Face , - Six Candlesticks , a Cup and Cover , and the Knives and Forks ; and told Pope , that when he took one of the Knives out of the Handle , to weigh the rest by , the Cement flew all over him . I carry 'd him to the Compter that Night , and on Monday I had him before Mr. Alderman Westly , where he confess 'd the whole Affair again ; but Alderman Westly referr 'd him to Sir William ; and on Tuesday I carry 'd him to Guild-hall , and Sir William being obliged to go out upon Business , we were heard by Sir John Eyles , and the Prisoner 's Confession was taken in Writing , but he refus 'd to sign it . George Kent . On Saturday Night , about Nine o'Clock , Mr. Haslop sent his Apprentice , to desire me to come to the Crown in Hanging-Sword-Court . I went thither , and found Mr. Arthur Barnard in the House . The Prisoner confessed to him , in my Hearing , that he undid the Padlock with a Nail , and forced open the Lock upon the Door with his Breech : That he then took out some Pieces of Plate , and carry 'd them to several Goldsmiths , who refused to buy them . He said he first broke off the Handles of the Cup , and offered them to all the Goldsmiths in Foster-Lane , but none of them would buy them . At last he offered them to Pope , and he bought them , without making any Scruple . After this he said , he bruised the rest of the Plate upon his Lapstone , and carry 'd it to Pope , who gave him 3 s. 6 d. an Ounce for some , and 4 s. for other Pieces : The Salvers , the Candle sticks , and the Top of the Cup , he mentioned in particular , and that he had bruied the Plate to get it out of the House undiscovered . The Dozen of Knives and Forks he said he sold to Pope all at one Time . John Morris , John Hill , Thomas Lyon , John Thorp , Richard Vaux , John Hamilton , Robert Dickenson , James Porter , Thomas Smith , Margaret Vaux , and William Willson , gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest Man , as far as they had heard of him , or known him .
