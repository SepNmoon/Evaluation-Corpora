Brides , December 20 . John Draper . On the 20th of December the Prisoner came into my Mother 's House ; ( her Name is Susannah Draper , she keeps the Globe-Tavern in Fleet-Street ) He bid me fetch him half a Pint of Wine , and order 'd the Cook to dress him a Beef Stake . I left him in the Kitchen ; but in a little Time , the Cook came to me , and told me , the Man was going out of the House with the Mug in his Pocket . I ran after him , and found him in the Entry , and one of our Boys standing before him ; I took him by the Collar , and held him while the Boy took the Mug out of his Pocket ; it was mark 'd IDS . and is my Mother 's : The Fellow to it , was stole about five Years ago . To excuse himself , he said he was in Liquor , and he did seem as if he had been drinking ; but he was very capable of committing this Fact , for he would have gone off with the Mug , if I had not stopp 'd him . He begg 'd of me not to prosecute him , but I carry 'd him before Sir Richard Brocas , and there he could not deny the Matter . Prisoner . I remember my going into the House , but I know nothing how I got out again . Upon my Word , I was very much in Liquor . They carry 'd me to the Counter , there I lay all Night , and the next Morning I wonder 'd where I was . John Draper . He made no resistance when we took him : He was going away , and had neither paid for his Wine , nor his Beef-Stake . Isaac Tilman . The Cook told me , the Man had got the Mug , in his Pocket , and that he was going off ; so I stopp 'd him in the Passage , and my Master coming to us , he held him , while I took it out of his Pocket . The Cook . I dress 'd the Prisoner a Beef-Stake , and he call 'd for some Beer , which was brought him in the Mug ; he drank up the Beer , and when I went out of the Kitchen to the Larder , I saw him ( through the Window ) put the Mug into his Pocket . I told the Boy , and bid him stop the Prisoner , while I ran to my young Master ; he went after him , and held him in the Passage , while the Boy took it out of his Pocket . I did not see it taken out of his Pocket , for when I had told my Master , I went back to the Kitchen . Prisoner . Was not I very much in Liquor ? Cook . No , you did seem to be much in Liquor . Defence . Ann Neveil The Prisoner liv 'd with my Mother as a Servant : I have known him ten Years , he is a Vintner by Trade , and I never knew or heard that he had ever robb 'd any one of a Pin . My Mother keeps Burton 's Coffee-House , St. James 's . Bridget Carrol . I have known him ten Years . His Father was a very honest Man , and I never heard any ill of him , till now . Alexander Gillender . I have known him from a Child ; he was born over-against me ; I always reckon 'd him a very honest Boy , and I have enquired of several People , with whom he has liv 'd and have heard nothing , but that he was a very honest Fellow . Guilty . Death . The Jury very earnestly recommended the Prisoner to his Majesty 's Favour , and desired the Intercession of the Court , that he might be transported for seven Years . 2.

See summary . ] 6 , 7 , Elizabeth Insome and Esther Redding , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , were indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 5 l. from the Person of James Powel , Dec. 14 . James Powel . On Tuesday Dec. 14 , about one in the Morning , I happen 'd to light on this Creature , ( Clare Dickenson ) and she asked me to give her a Dram ? so we went to the Prisoner Insome 's House ; I do n't know whether 't is Insome 's House or Robert Redding 's , but I had my Watch there , and there I lost it : I am sure I had it when I went in , but when I put my Hand into my Pocket to pay for the Drams , I had neither Money nor Watch . Clare Dickenson I was the Person that went into Redding 's with the Prosecutor to drink a Dram , and there he lost his Watch : I saw Insome take it , and deliver it to Redding . They said , truly they wonder 'd how he could pick up such a nasty black-guard Creature as I am : But we had three Quarterns of Gin , and Insome I am same took the Watch and gave it to Redding . I told the Prosecutor so in the House , but yet they stripp 'd me there , and used me so improperly , that I should have had a Midwife . Then they search 'd me again , in Holborn Watch-house , and used me ill there . The Prosecutor would not mind what I said , 'till he got me to the Watch-house , and the Prisoners were glad to get us out of the House , for if we were but gone , they said they should be safe enough . They call 'd me a Black-guard , and wonder 'd how he could have any Thing to do with such a dirty Wretch as I am . Q Where does Redding live ? Dickenson . Over-against St. Giles 's Church ; I do n't know the Sign . Insome . My Lord I did bring them their Liquor ; but ask her if I sat down with them . Dickenson . Yes ; you sat down by him ; you took the Watch out of his Pocket ; then you took the Candle and went down Stairs , and said , you wonder 'd how any body could pick up such a Black-guard , dirty Bitch as I was . Insome . The Man brought the Creature into the House , and asked for a Lodging : I shew 'd them up Stairs and carried them Liquour : When I call 'd for the Reckoning , he said he had lost his Money and his Watch . I told him , he had not lost it in our House ; why then says he , I have lost it in Drury-Lane ; with that he fell upon his Creature and beat her sadly ; Redding call 'd the Watch , to take them out of the House ; the Watchmen asked him who he could charge with the Robbery , and he said , he could charge no one , but Dickenson . John Barringer . I am a Watchman , and was call 'd to take this Man and Dickenson out of Redding 's House . He said he had lost a Watch , and a Guinea in Gold , and Silver ; but , says he , I do n't value the Money , if I could but get my Watch . We search 'd Dickenson , but found nothing upon her ; so we carry 'd her to the Round-House , and next Morning before the Justice : there she said she saw Insome take it and give it to Redding , and so we took them up . In Redding 's House , he charged the Fact on Clare Dickenson only Thomas Price . I was crying , - past One o'Clock , - and they call 'd , Watch ! but please your Honour my Lord , I would not go , without the other Watchman . This Gentlewoman is a common Night Walker , she was there , and the Man told us he had lost his Watch , and he fell a beating the Creature as if he had been mad : says I , - do n't beat her so , before us , but charge us with her , and take her according to Law , please your Honour my Lord . We search 'd her , but found nothing : I said , do you charge any of these Women , ( for there was three Women more in the Room ) no , says he , I ca n't say whether the Prisoners were any of them that were then Present . Susannah Palmer . Appear 'd to the Prisoners Characters . Both Acquitted . 8. Daniel Dowgard , was indicted for stealing Seventy-three Bushels of Sea-Coal , value 3 l. the Goods of Ann Atkinson and Deborah Sparks , December 20 . Guilty , Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9. John Hutchinson , of Stepney , was indicted for stealing a set of Chains , used for Horse Harness , value 15 s. the Goods of William Preston , in his Stable , Dec. 31 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 10. John Friend , of Ickenham , was indicted for assaulting William Haydon , in a certain open Field near the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him two Linnen Bags , value 6 d. four Pounds of Beef , value 8 d. one Quart of Peas , value 2 d and 6 d. in Money , the Property of the said Haydon , and a Wooden Bottle of spirituous Liquors , value 2 s. 6 d. the Property of Mary Owen . Haydon . On Saturday Night last , I was met by the Prisoner coming from Uxbridge , in the first Road near the Cart Road , at a Stile . 'T was between 6 and 7 at Night . I cry 'd who 's there , and knowing the Prisoner , I call 'd him by his Name ; but he darted his Stick at me , cut a great Gash in my Throat , and knock 'd me backwards : Then he came over the Stile , and was making another Blow at me ; but I slipp 'd on one Side , and avoided it . He took from me all the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment ; so I went Home and got two Men to search after him , but they could not find him . I told my Wife how I was robb 'd , and there was a great Congregation of People , who went again to his House ; I tax 'd him with it at his House ; he was in a very great Sweat , and said ( as how ) he knew nothing of it . He lives but a Mile and a half from me , and is lame of one Hand ; he 's the Man and no body else . I have gone in Danger of my Life on his Account before now . Q . Did you find any of your Goods again ? Haydon . Yes , in a Dog-house of the Duke of Bolton 's , about 10 or 20 Pole from the Place where I was robb 'd . My Lord , he has acted very Ugly by me before now . Q . So you think he robb 'd you for robbing 's sake , and out of Malice ! Haydon . I do n't know what he did it for , not I. William Wright . I am a Neighbour between the two Men : When Haydon came Home , I heard he had been robb 'd by the Prisoner , so I went to him ( the Prisoner ) and I found him in a great Heat ; I asked him how he came to be in such a sweat : He said , he always sweat very much when he walk 'd . The Prosecutor , my Lord , has a very good Character , and the Prisoner a very indifferent one . 'T is true , he is lame , but he has often made use of his lame Hand : for some Time ago he got his Bread by his Labour , but now he 's kept by the Parish , because he is lame of his Hand and his Leg ; he is very lame indeed , at some Times , and at others , he walks better . Prisoner . Do you know any Thing dishonest by me ? Wright . No , I do n't , but John , you have a very indifferent Character . Another . All the Parish will give Haydon a good Character ; the other , they will not . Another . The Prisoner is a Man of a very ill Principle , and I believe he was guilty , because we never catch 'd the Prosecutor in any ill demeanour . The Prisoner is often out o'Nights pretty late , and I think it looks as if he was guilty . Defence . 'T is easy to see , that I am a lame Man : My right Hand is lame , and my right Leg and Thigh is not bigger than my Wrist : I am past my Labour and can not work for my Bread , so I have Assistance from the Parish , and therefore they have done this out of Spite . Acquitted . 11. Joseph Lillyman , of Stepney , was indicted for stealing a pair of Linnen Sheets , value 2 s. the Goods of Joseph Meage , out of his Lodging , January 9 . Guilty 10 d.

December 8 . And 17 , Eleanor Coleman , for receiving a Gown , a Cloak and other Things , knowing them to be stole . Sarah Smith I was in our Cart almost asleep ; and I heard some body ask the Man that drove it , where his Master and Mistress was : They had no sooner spoke , but they pull 'd the Tilt off the Cart , and said , Money they wanted , and Money they must have : My Husband said , Gentlemen , I am a poor Man ; but they clapp 'd a Pistol to his Head , and pull 'd of my Pocket in the Cart ; what Money I had , I hit down in the bottom of the Cart , but they pick 'd it up ; I ca n't swear how much it was . Then they pull 'd me out of the Cart , and carry 'd me into a Field , and stripped me of my Gown , three Cloaks , one of them was my Maid 's ( Eunace Newman ) a linnen Apron , a Handkerchief and they took my Shoes off my Feet . I can not swear to any of the Prisoners , for they all the Time endeavoured to hide my Face , that I might not for them . I saw one of them abuse my Husband , but I can not swear to him . Francis Smith . We were going Home with our Cart , and four Men assaulted us ; two of them got up into the Cart and robb 'd us : I remember one of them , I believe , but I do n't care to swear positively ; one of them had a red Coat on . Q . Was either of the Prisoners there ? Francis Smith . Yes , Ryan stood on the off Side of the Cart , and gave me several knocks as I was in it . One had a red Coat , but I ca n't swear to him . Ryan cry 'd d - n you come down , and gave me several Blows . They took all the Money I had from me , I ca n't say how much that was . Ryan . What is the meaning that you can swear to one , and not to another ? - Hah ! How many of us were in Company ? F. Smith . There were four of you in all . Ryan . And pray which of the four do you know ? F. Smith . You in particular . Ryan . With humble Submission my Lord , why should he know me in particular ? F. Smith . Because you gave me a great many ugly Knocks . Ryan . With humble Submission my Lord , I ca n't tell why he should have any Notice of me . F. Smith . Why you damn 'd me , and bid me turn about , and it was you that pull 'd my great Coat over my Back . Ryan . And will you swear it ? F. Smith . Yes , I do . Ryan . With humble Submission my Lord , inform your self about that Fellow . F. Smith . They took nothing but our Money from us in the Cart , but they made us go into the Field , and they took my Great Coat , and my Wife 's Cloaths from her in the Field , after they had plunder 'd the Cart . Ryan . Well , I suppose you know who they were . F. Smith . I ca n't swear that the same Man that robb 'd the Cart stripp 'd us in the Field ; but I can with a safe Conscience swear that Ryan was among them in the Field ; they d - 'd us when they drove us up the Field and bid us go faster . Ryan . I have no Business to ask him any Questions . F. Smith . My great Coat was brought me from Justice De Veil 's , and the Cloak which was brought from thence , my Maid will swear to . Ryan . My Lord with humble Submission , what 's the Reason he should know particular Marks of me , before three more ? with humble Submission my Lord , why does he know me ? F. Smith . I know you by your Voice , your Nose , your black Hair , by your laying so violently upon me ( for I was cover 'd all over with Blood ) I know you by your Boldness , and your strutting Manner . Ryan . My Lord , with humble Submission , that Fellow will swear that a Cow is a Jack-ass . With humble Submission , you must understand the Evidence ; I do n't know what they are , not I , the Thief-takers instruct them for the sake of the Reward , - and that 's every Thing . F. Smith . He clapp 'd a Pistol to my Head in the Field , and bid me lye down ; then they bound us ; they ty 'd my Hands behind me with a strong penny Cord , and my Legs they fasten 'd up to my Hands . Before they bound me , they pull 'd off my Coat and Waistcoat and Shoes . I do n't know the Day of the Month this was done , but my Wife does . S. Smith . 'T was the 8th of this last December . Q Would you ask the Witnesses any Questions ? Ryan . With humble Submission , he swears so much , that I do n't know what to ask him . Joseph Nash . One of them jump 'd out of a Ditch and stopp 'd the Cart ; they turn 'd the Fore-horse , and swore if I stirr 'd they would shoot me as I sat on the Copses of the Cart . 'T was that Man ( Ryan ) that turn 'd the Horse . Ryan . With humble Submission , inform your self what this Fellow has sworn , - and these Evidences . Nash . I swear you abus 'd my Master , and pull 'd his coat off , and he , hope ( help 'd ) to pull it off . I lost 22 d. in Money , and my Hat and my Knife . There was four of them , and they all jump 'd out of the Ditch upon me . Ryan . You swore before Justice De Viel , that I was the first Man that knock 'd you down . Terence O'Bryan . James Ryan , Hugh Macmahon , John Macdonald , Francis Dun and I , met this same Man in the High Road , between Tottenham and the quarter House , in Hampstead Road : we stopp 'd his Cart , and got the Man down , and took a Shilling and some Brass , about 16 d. in all from him , as far as I can understand , that same Hugh Macmahon , and John Macdonald went into the Cloth that cover 'd the Cart , stripp 'd it off , and took a Pocket from the Woman ; then they made the Man and the Woman come out of the Cart , they took the Man 's Coat , and the Woman 's Pocket ; I ca n't justly tell whether they took any Cloaths from the Woman 'till they came to the Field ; but there they took her Handkerchief , her Cloak , her Gown , her Apron , and her Shoes . There was James Ryan , Hugh Macmahon , John Macdonald at present - Ryan . At present , - Hah ! O'Bryan . I was there in Company at present my Lord , the Handkerchief was found on Ryan , and the Gown on Ellen Coleman , that goes under the Name of Ryan 's Wife . That very same Night I came into Ryan 's Room , and he delivered the Cloth Coat to her to pawn ; and the Gown he gave to her , I can not justly say whether I told her the Things were stole or not . Q . Was you there when the Things were deliver 'd to Coleman ? O'Bryan . Yes , my Lord , and the same Time we all went to one Lacey 's House to drink . Coleman knew it was on the same subject it was , - when she receiv 'd the Things , and she knew we could come by them no other Way but by robbing on the High-way . Macmahon . Please your Lordship , ask how long he has known me in this Country ? O'Bryan . About Three Months before he was taken up . Macmahon . Very well : where , ( with Submission ) did you know me first ? O'Bryan . Not in Ireland , but in France . I became acquainted with you in this Country at London : the first Time I saw you was at Ryan 's Room . Macmahon . Very well , please the Honourable Court , he lodged over against my Room in Newtoner's-Lane ; and the first Time I ever saw him was at Gravesend . The whole Court and your Lordship will all know by and by , that I will prove this Man to be a Perjury [ perjur 'd ] before the whole Court . On what Occasion did I become acquainted with you ? O'Bryan . I was at Ryan 's Room , on the same Intention , to go a robbing on the Highway . Macmahon . Did I ask you , or did you ask me ? Ryan . My Lord , with humble Submission , - he is very capable of swearing , - pray how long have you known me ? O'Bryan . I knew Ryan in the same Regiment that I was in , about four Years ago , and about three Quarters of a Year ago , he went to get Recruits for the same Regiment . He was in Garrison with me in the French King 's Service at St. Omers . Ryan . With humble Submission , my Lord , how came he to have Access to my Room , - out and in , above any other ? Eunace Newman . I can only swear this is my Cloak ; my Mistress put it on when she went out . Owen Griffith . I had a Warrant to apprehend Ryan and several others , for Robberies on the Highway , and Eleanor Coleman for receiving stolen Goods . Ryan was taken in Rag-Fair , in Company with others , upon him we found a Handkerchief , ( 't was here produced ) 't was taken from him at Colonel Williamson 's : I ca n't swear positively this is the very same which was then taken from him ; because it was left in the Colonel 's Custody all Night , but 't is like it , and if it is the same there is the Colonel 's Seal upon it . S. Smith . This very Handkerchief they took off my Neck in the Field . Griffith . It was left with Colonel Williamson , who is Governor of the Tower all Night , and I received it from him seal 'd . Col. Williamson . This Handkerchief was taken from Ryan in my Presence , and these Buckles were taken out of his Shoes ; this Hat was took from him too , in my Presence . I lock 'd them up in my Scrutore all Night , then I seal 'd them , and deliver 'd them to the Constable . Griffith . After the Governor had committed Ryan to Newgate , I took Coleman in Custody on a different Warrant for receiving Goods stolen ; so we brought her to the Round House to be examin 'd . Next Day when we came to Newgate , Colonel Deacon inform 'd us , that the Cloak on Coleman 's Back was the same that was taken from Smith ; accordingly I went to the Round House and took it from her , and here it is . Eunace Newman . This is my Cloak , the same I lent my Mistress . Ryan 's Defence . With humble Submission , my Lord , 't is all false that they have sworn about the Handkerchief and the Hat , and the Governor of the Tower . Inform your self how she lost them , and who took them from her . C. Why she says you took them from her . Ryan . 'T is a cursed Lie , with humble Submission ; my Moan is , - shall this Woman here , ( meaning Coleman ) answer for this ? I tell you , - I do n't deny but I have been a Transgressor , but that 's no Reason an innocent Person should lose her Life by the Liar and the Perjuror . I do n't deny but I have been a Transgressor , and by the Grace of God I shall suffer . Macmahon 's Defence . When I came over from France , and got to Gravesend , I met this O'Bryan , he had Six Men with him , which he was carrying into the French Service . This was Two Days before Allhallontide , he went on toward France , and I came to London , with two young Fellows in my Company . There is one Garvey can justify that he lent half a Guinea in France or Flanders , about 14 or 15 Days after I parted with him , yet the Man swears I did these Things . Lord ! see what difference there is in the Man 's Talk . The Woman he lent the Money too , keeps the Horse-shoe and Magpye in Drury-Lane . I hope you 'll look into his Manners , - why , and how he is striving to take my Life away , because I have no Friends to stand by me . Ellen Coleman . Ask him how he came acquainted with me . O'Bryan . I became acquainted with her in Flanders . Coleman . Examine him over again , my Lord , pray examine him over again . I am a poor Woman , and have serv 'd the Counsellors in Lincolns-Inn and Chancery-Lane , and several of the Council now in the Court with Flowers very honestly . Ryan . What she has done was by my Order , I am her Husband : I do n't know any Robbery she has committed . Ryan and Macmahon Guilty . Death . Coleman . Guilty . Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 18 , 19. James Ryan , Gerrard Fitzgerald , and James Falconer , were indicted for assaulting James North in the King 's Highway in the Parish of Pancras , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Cloth Great Coat , a Cloth Coat , 2 Handkerchiefs , a Pair of Breeches , and a Holland Stock , and 10 s. in Money , Nov. 7. James North . About 7 or 8 o'Clock at Night , Nov. 7 . I was going up Highgate Hill , and I was robb 'd by three Men ; but I can not swear to the Prisoners ; two Men came up to me , and the other stood at a Distance to look out . They rifled my Pockets , and took five Penn'orth of half Pence , and 10 s. which was in a little Silk Purse . I am not positive whether there was any Silver among the Half-pence or not . One Man had a great hoarse Voice , the other was a spare Man , a low Voice , and pale Complection ; the Moon was over-cast , and it was pretty dark ; so I can not be positive to the Men ; but here is the Hat which was taken on O'Bryan 's Head , and which they took from me when I was robb 'd . They put me into a Ditch , and took my own Cloaths , and made me put on these , which I have here in this Handkerchief . Q . How far was the Ditch from the Place where you was first assaulted ? North . I was going to Highgate , and they took me over two great Fields , and thro ' a Gateway , to the farther Corner of the second Field . My Money they took from me in the Road , and my Cloaths in the Ditch , at the farther end of the second Field . Two robbed me , and the third stood at a Distance , seemingly to keep Guard . Ryan . With humble Submission - keep the Prosecutor in Custody . O'Bryan is instructed in all Villainy ; he has had the Opportunity of it . C. ( To O'Bryan ) Take care you speak nothing but the Truth , and remember you are upon your Oath to do so . O'Bryan . The Prisoners at the Bar robbed a Man near Kentish Town . Ryan and Falconer led him cross the Road , and Fitzgerald stood at some Distance . One of them took hold of him , and the other push 'd him thro ' a Ditch and a Hedge , into a Field on the Right Hand going to Highgate . Ryan commanded me to stand at a Distance with Arms ; I follow 'd , at a Distance , and saw the Man stripp 'd naked , but Ryan commanded me back , to watch the Road . I ca n't tell which of them stipp 'd him , but Ryan , Falconer , and Fitzgerald , were with him , and one of them went into the Ditch with him , but which of them it was I can not tell . When they had done with the Man , they came to the Place where I stood , and Ryan gave me the Man 's Hat out of his Hand ; and here it is ; this is the very same Hat . North . This is the Hat I lost at that Time ; 't was taken from me in the Ditch . Q . What Time was it when you went upon this Robbery ? O'Bryan . As near as I understand , 't was between Eight and Nine at Night , between Kentish Town and Highgate , at the Bottom of the Hill . Q . How many were present at the Robbery ? O Bryan . There was Ryan and Falconer first ; they laid Hands on the Man first . Fitzgerald went to them , but at the present Time he stood at some Distance from them . Ryan . My Lord , with humble Submission - look in that Fellow 's Face , while he talks . Q . Where was you when they went up to the Man ? O'Bryan . I was a little behind , and I went up to'em the same Time . They open 'd his Breeches in the Road , whether they took any Money , I can not tell ; but they carry 'd him thro ' Hedge and Ditch , and over one Field to another , and there , in a Ditch , they chang 'd Cloaths with him . Ryan , when he had done , gave me Two Shillings and Three Pence , but I had nothing of his Cloaths but the Hat . They did not tell me of the Cloaths they had given him , but they told me they had ty 'd him with his own Garters . North . They made me take my Garters off my right Leg , and they ty 'd my Hands prodigious hard . Ryan . Only compare his Affidavit now with what he produced before his Worship Justice De Veil , and the Governor of the Tower . Fitzgerald . Ryan can clear me . O'Bryan . I have known Fitzgerald these 12 Months Counsel . When was you last in France ? O'Bryan . About four Months before I was taken . Counsel . Do n't you remember your telling any one , that you intended to go to France the 27th of October last ? O'Bryan . No , I do n't remember any thing of it . Counsel . Do you know one Mrs. Garvey ? O'Bryan . Yes . Counsel . Do you know one Antony Ellis ? O'Bryan . No . Counsel . Do you know one Mr. Clark ? O'Bryan . Yes . Counsel . Do you know Francis Allen , or Elizabeth Broughton ? O'Bryan . No . Counsel . Do you remember any thing of meeting Garvey 's Wife in Flanders in November last ? O'Bryan . No ; I do not . I heard that this same Woman kill 'd a Man , and run away . Now she is come to swear falsly against me . She is a vile Woman , and keeps a House for Thieves , Highway Robbers , Pickpockets and Rogues . Counsel . Do you remember any thing of Mrs. Garvey 's being in Flanders in November last ? O'Bryan . No , I do n't remember I saw her at all . Counsel . Do you remember any thing of lending her Money in Flanders , and of receiving from her a Token to her Husband , within these two or three or four Months ? O'Bryan . No , I do n't . Counsel . Were you in Company with Fitzgerald lately ? O'Bryan . I was in one Sherlock 's House , one Night , and he was sitting at one Table , and I at another ; I have been drinking in the same House , but not in his Company . The same Night that the Robery was committed , I was in one Cosgrave 's House , in Princes-Street ; and Ryan told me there , that Fitzgerald and Falconer were to meet him behind the Duke of Bedford 's House in the Fields . Ryan . I want to know what he has to object against my Wife . - Hear his Objections . I beg the Affidavit he made before Justice De Veil , and the Governor of the Tower , may be produced . Mr. De Veil . This is the Examination I took , which O'Bryan sign 'd after it was read over to him . Clerk Reads . Middlesex . The Information of Terence O'Bryan , taken before me Thomas De Veil , Esq ; & c. Jan. 9 , 1736-7. Who being on Oath says , That James Ryan , Gerrard Fitzgerald , and James Falconer , were concerned with him in a Robbery committed a little beyond Kentish Town , about three Months ago , but says , he can not swear to the Person , who then was robb 'd . Falconer . He says there , the Robbery was committed three Months ago , and the Prosecutor says it was on the 9th of November . He likewise told Justice De Veil , that we went together out of Ryan 's House . Mr. De Veil , He did say so . After I had taken the Examination he was asked from whence they set out ; and he said , he went from Ryan 's Room . Q . From what Place did you go when this Robbery was committed ? O'Bryan . We came from Cosgrave 's House in Princes Street , and Fitzgerald and Falconer were to meet as behind the Duke of Bedford 's . I am a free Evidence ; when I came in , there was nothing laid to my Charge - What Need have I to take away their Lives ? Counsel . The Prosecutor says , he saw no more than three Men , and O'Bryan swears there were four . C. He swears that three Men went up to him , and that he stood at a Distance Eliz Garvey . I live at the Horshoe and Magpie in Drury lane , and know O'Bryan very well ; he used to frequent my House . On the 1st of November I was obliged to go away for France . Col. De Veil knows 't was on Account of Hawkins and Brown . I left my House on the Monday , and I met O'Bryan at Arras in Flanders on Tuesday or Wednesday following ; he was along with the Carravan and seeing me , he asked if I wanted Money , I told him , no ; you will perhaps , says he , for you are going to a very dear Place ; and he offered to lend me half a Guinea . I took it , and gave him this Pocket-Piece to give my Husband as a Token , that he was to pay him half a Guinea again ; and on the 11th Day of the Month , I wrote to my Husband , and informed him , I had deliver 'd O'Bryan the Pocket-Piece upon this Occasion . Anthony Ellis . I know O'Bryan . He came from France in November last , about Nine o'Clock in the Morning ; I ca n't swear to the Day , but I think it was about the 15th or 16th . My Master was sitting by the Fire , and he said he was very cold , being just come off the Water , and was then return 'd from France . He said he had seen my Mistress on the Way , and had lent her Half a Guinea ; at the same Time giving my Master the Pocket Piece . I ca n't say whether my Master paid him the Half Guinea again , but they had a great deal of Discourse together , more than the Half Guinea came to . He owes 3s . 6d . upon our Score now . I live at the Horshoe-and-Magpie in Drury lane . Wm Clark . Oct. 27 . O'Bryan left my House to go to France ; on Nov. 16 he return 'd , and paid me 8 s. in part of a Debt . I wrote this Memorandum the Day that he went away , but I can not tell the Day of the Week . O'Bryan . Can you tell whether I went to France or not ? Clark I know it , but from his telling me so . I know Fitzgerald very well , as far as I Know he works hard for his Bread , at labouring among the Bricklayers . Judith Webb . Francis Allen , at Red Bull Alehouse in Vine-street , and Elizabeth Browlter the Prisoner 's Sister , appear 'd to Fitzgerald 's Character . Q . ( To O'Bryan ) When did you last go to France ? O'Bryan . Half a Year ago I did not go in October last . I went but towards Dover , and turn 'd back again . Q . Did you meet Garvis at any Time , at Arras in Flanders . O'Bryan . No , I did not , nor did I lend her Half a Guinea , nor do I know any Thing of the Token she speaks of ; nor did I ever declare to any one , That I had been in France , and was return 'd the 16th of November I hope the Court will look in their Characters . Thomas Longbottom . When we enquired after Falconer , Barnes and I found him at the Swan in Vere Street . The House was full of Labourers , so I told him I wanted to speak with him hard by ; he told me , he smelt a Snitch , and would come out for no Body - Barnes I took Fitzgerald up for the Rescue of Casey . He has the Character of a reputed Thief and Pick Pocket at the Play-houses . When Longbottom and I were perswading him to come out of the House where we found him , he said , he smelt a Snitch and would not come out Richard Eustace . On Tuesday last I was at the Golden Lyon-by Hicks-Hall ; there was Mr. Keate , and Mr. Bignal , and the Keeper of New Prison ; and O'Bryan , was there in Custody of the Clerk of the Papers of Tothill fields Bridewell . I spake to O'Bryan , and he said , he believed he knew me in Flanders . I asked him , if he remember 'd his meeting between Arras and Bethune in Flanders Yes , says he , and I lent her Half a Guinea , and she gave me a Piece of Silver to return her Husband , but it was a long Time before November . O'Bryan . Here is the Keeper of New Prison ; ask him if he heard any such Discourse : - 'T is all false . Barnes . Among all these People that have sworn , there 's not one but what are Irish . All Guilty . Death . 20. James Ryan , Garret Farrel , and Hugh Macmahon , were indicted for assaulting Edmund Rowbottom , in a certain Field near the King 's Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from a Hat , value 2 s a Peruke , value 2 s. a Cloth Coat , value 5 s. a Cloth Waistcoat value 5 s. a holland Shirt , value 6 s a Pair of Stockings , value 2 s. a Pair of Buckles , value 1 s a Pair of Shoes , value 18 d. Pair of Buckskin Breeches , value 10 s. and 3 s 6 d. in Money Nov. 20 . [ The Witnesses were examin 'd apart . ] Edward Rowbottom I ca n't say the Prisoners are the Men ; but on the 26th of November , between and eight , I was robb 'd in the Field , beyond the Half-way-House going to Hampstead . They took my Hat and Wig , my Coat , Waistcoat , Breeches , Shirt , Shoes , Stockings , and Buckles . Afterwards they bound my Hands behind me , and my left Leg up to my Hands then they ty 'd a Handkerchief over my Mouth , and rolled me into a Ditch ; they took my Money 3 s. 6 d. as well as my Cloaths , and that was all Sir . Q . How many was there of them ? Rowbottom . There was three of them , two led me down the Field , and the third followed me . 'T was a little Moon-light , but they kept an old Hat over my Face , that I should not see them . Two of them were much of a Size , and one was a little taller . Ryan . With humble Submission , - these Thief-catchers have instructed him too , in all Villanies . Terence O'Bryan . Ryan , Farrel , Macmahon , and one Macdonal , went out with Intention to rob on the Highway : We went above the Half-way-House into the Foot-Road . We heard a Man coming up the Path , so Ryan , Farrel , and I went up to him , and brought him down to the Bottom of the Field , farthest from the Road ; we took 3 s. 6 d. from him , - half a Crown and two Six-pences This was beyond Mother Redcap 's , just at the Back of Kentish Town . When we had got him into the Field , Ryan bid him deliver his Money ; then he commanded Farrel and I to bring him to the Ditch . The Man - I do n't know who he was , but he told us he was but a poor Servant ; he made no resistance , so we took from him his Hat , Wig , Coat , Waistcoat , Shirt , Breeches , Stockings , Shoes and Buckles . The Stockings were found upon Ryan , which the Man has sworn to . Q . What did you do next ? O Bryan . We bound him with a Penny Cord , and turn 'd him into the Ditch ; both his Hands were ty 'd behind him and one of his Legs . Ryan , Farrel and I , were with the Man when he was bound ; the others stood in the High Road . Ryan . With what intent did they stand there O'Bryan . For fear any enterprize should come upon us : When we had done , Macmahon and Macdonald came up to us and join 'd us . Ryan . Observe how often he convinces ( contradict ) his own Story . O Bryan . The Man 's Cloaths were brought the same Night to Ryan 's Room , and his Wife pawn 'd them . Ryan . Let his Informations before Col. De-Viel , and the Governor of the Tower be produc 'd then we 'll stand in our own Defence . I do n't alledge in my own Behalf in the least . I have trangress 'd ; but 't is a Sin and a Shame the Oath of a Villain should be taken . Owen Griffith . When I was before Col. Williamson O Bryan told me that Ryan had the Stockings on his Legs , and the Buckles in his Shoes , which they took from Rowbottom . I went to Ryan in Newgate and took them off his Legs , here they are . Rowbottom . These are the Stockings and Buckles they took from me . Griffith . I bought him another Pair , and took them off . Ryan . I pull 'd them off , - I was obliged to pull them off , as I might be my Shirt , when these Fellows swear so . Col. Williamson . This is O'Bryan 's Information ; it was read over to him , and he Sign 'd it before me . The Information of Terence O'Bryan , taken before Col. Williamson . Who saith , That he , with James Ryan , Hugh Macmahon , Garret Farrel , and John Macdonald , were out about a Month since , upon the Road to Hampstead , and that particularly , the latter End of last Month they robb 'd a Man who appears to be Benjamin Short , stripping him and tying him in the Manner he deposed , on the Trial of Gilbert Fruer , and for which Fact at the Old-Bailey the said Fruer was condemned . And he farther saith , the said Fruer was not concerned in the said Robbery , nor doth he know him . He farther saith , that among the Things taken , were a Knife , and a Pair of Buckles , both which were produced by O'Bryan , and sworn by Short to be the Buckles and Knife taken from him . He says that Macdonald was not assisting in this Robbery , but was within Call , if his assistance should be wanted . He farther faith , that James Ryan about two Months ago , robb 'd a single Man on the Road between Highgate and Kentish Town , which Man was stopp 'd by Ryan , who with Fitzgerald robb 'd him of Money , and stripp 'd him to his Skin , ty 'd him , and left him in a Ditch ; that the Money they took from him was about 9s . as Ryan had told him . That Falconer is a thick Man , about 36 Years old , wears a Wig but often a Cap : Fitzgerald is about 23 Years old a tight Man in a brown Wig . Col. Williamson . He made several Depositions , some Robberies he forgot , and he recollected them by piece meal ; they came out one after another . Here is another Information . - Terence O'Bryan farther deposeth , that Garret Farrel was concerned in a Robbery at Hampstead , by robbing , stripping , and binding a Man ; the said Farrel is a tall , lusty Fellow , full Face , black Hair , wears a red Coat , and is about 28 Years of Age . He farther says , that Dun and Lacey were concerned in the above Robbery , and all the rest , and likewise in enlisting Men for the Service of the French King . Farrel . I can bring a Woman to prove that I was elsewhere at the same Time , doing Work for honest Victuals . - Pray from whence did we descend to do this Robbery . O'Bryan From one Dive 's House four of us went ; there were two more than I have mentioned , and they are Lacey and Dun . I do n't know the Prosecutor Rowbottom , but at the Robbery the 26th of November , there was Ryan , Farrel , Macmahon , and Macdonald , and my self , and one Lacey , who is gone to France , and that is the Reason he is not mark 'd . Lacey went out with us , but he staid a little behind in the Road , waiting till we came back . Dives is a Soldier in the Guards , and keeps a Cook 's Shop in Newtoners-Lane . Farrel I have known this 12 Months , he came over to recruit for the King of France . Farrel . I serve his Majesty , - God bless him , and that Rogue says , I serve the King of France . Ryan . With humble Submission , - this Rogue when he was apprehended , - but I ca n't rightly tell it you , - he had two Coats of other People 's on his Back . Col. Williamson . O'Bryan was taken by the Custom-house Officers , on Tower-Hill , on Suspicion of having a Parcel of Tea . This I had from Colonel Deacon , who came to me , and said he had committed a Man the Day before , to the Gaol of the Tower Liberty , on Suspicion of being a naughty Person , for he had found a Pocket Pistol upon him , and he desir 'd my Assistance to examine him . There appear 'd nothing against him but his having two Coats and a loaded Pistol , made us suspect him to be a naughty Fellow . I threaten 'd to commit him , and in an Advertisement to describe him , and the two Coats which were found upon him , if he would not discover his Accomplices He said he was innocent , and would make no Discovery , so we made his Mittimus , but as he was going down Stairs , he desired to be brought back again ; then he told us , we had no Proof of any Thing against him , but however he would become a frank Evidence for the King , and then he declared all these Things . I found he had been a Soldier in the French King 's Service . Farrel . There is nothing against me but this Man , and upon my Shoul , he would hang all the Court for the Sake of the Reward . Eliz Dorrel . Farrel came to live at my House the first of November , - the first of October I mean , and he liv 'd there till the Time he was taken up , which was the 23d of December . He us 'd all the while he abided in my House to go out betimes in a Morning with his Knot and Basket to Market ; he always came Home about 10 or 11 o'Clock in the Forenoon , and never stirr 'd out an Hour till the next Morning ; he never stirr 'd out of the House from the first of October to the 23d of December , after he return 'd in a Morning from Market . Q. Pray , if he never in all this Time stirr 'd out , neither in the Afternoons nor in the Evenings , how did he spend his Time ? Dorrel . In cleaning the Knives , or fetching me Water , or playing with the Children . He has never been from the Door in any Evening all this Time . Q . On the 15th of November , where was he then ? Dorrel . At Home , as I am on my Oath , and the Virtue of it , I do n't swear he was never out of the House , - I have no Occasion to suspect ( inspect ) into Days of the Month , but I am sure he was never out of the House to my Knowledge ; 't is true I have been out my self sometimes ; but I have left him to take Care of the House . Q . What Day of the Week was the 26th of November ? Dorrel . 'T was Sunday if I can tell . No , I do n't know the Day of the Week . Q . Did you see him on the 26th of November ? Dorrel . I ca n't say - but on the Virtue of my Oath , I never miss 'd him out the 26th nor the 25th . He was never out of my House ; and as for the Man that has sworn against him , he never was in his Company in his Life . Q . How do you know that ? Jane O'Callan . I us 'd to open the Door to him every Morning when he went out to Market ; when he came from Market , he would be in the House all the Week ; on Sundays he us 'd to go out a Shoe blacking . Upon my Life , he us 'd always to be at Home , I ca n't say ( no ) more . All Guilty .

Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 33 , 34 , 35 , John Warwick , of St. Clement Danes , Victualler , Christopher Baws , of St. George 's Middlesex , Cordwainer , and John Wills , of London Brandy-man , were indicted for a Misdemeanor , in contriving and conspiring falsly to charge John Drinkwater with a Felony and Robbery on the Highway , April 16 , in the 8th Year of his Majesty 's Reign . The Counsel for the Prosecution having open 'd the Charge , they proceeded to call their Witnesses John Drinkwater I liv 'd six Months with Warwick ; he kept the Swan in Sheer Lane , 't was a very disorderly House , for there was scarce a Night pass 'd , but Gentlemens Pockets were pick 'd , and he always had a share of the Money . He invited me to come and live with him , telling me the Profits of his House would maintain me ; but I did not think myself safe there , and would have come away sooner , but I was afraid of being sworn into a Goal . On the 3d , of April , 1735 , I apprehended the Prisoner Wills , and one Curtis and Pritchard , and Pye and Williams , for being all concern 'd in stealing my Watch . Warwick ordered me my Watch again , but he immediately enter 'd an Action against me for 40 l. and I was arrested and carried to Wood street Compter directly : Then to prevent my Wife from assisting me , he arrested her in a Poultry Compter Action , at somebody 's suit , - but she 'd give an Account of that . Soon after I was lodged in Wood street Compter , I was detain 'd by Virtue of a Warrant of Detainer , from Sir Richard Hopkins , on Oath of the Prisoner Baws , - I have a Copy of it here , somewhere . After this I had notice , that Warwick had withdrawn his Action for Debt , and that I must remove to Chelmsford Jail in Essex ; the Keeper of the Compter told me this on the 21st , of April : They call 'd me up betimes in the Morning , and said they had got a Habeas Corpus , to carry me to Chelmsford Jail : I asked them who brought it ; they told me one Mr. Ray . Upon this , I set out for Chelmsford , and one John Clark , who was concern 'd with the Prisoners in the Conspiracy , came on Horse-back to the Compter-Gate to attend me . When we had got about five Miles out of Town , Warwick , Joyce , Meads and Wills , waited for my coming by , and they told the People , that I was one of the Essex Gang , and Broomhall was forced to get me a Stick to defend my self with on the Road . When I came to the Jail , they told the People there , that I had broke out of several Jails already ; so upon this Account I was ill used ; and they staid with me , to see me loaded with the heaviest Irons that were in the Jail . I was here confin 'd and iron 'd from the 21st of April , till the Assizes in July following ; but the Week before the Assizes , Wills and Warwick came down , and wanted to agree with me . They told me Joyce was put into the Angel Tavern by Temple bar , and that he would be glad to agree likewise ; but , say 'd they , you have been cruelly and wrongfully charged ; but if you 'll punish him , you shall be discharged . I told them , I would not agree with them 'till I had brought them to Justice . Then they told me , I should be carry 'd to another Jayl , and that my Wife should be in Jayl too . Warwick say 'd this , and Wills was in Company with him . Accordingly , on Sunday following , I receiv 'd a Letter , informing me , That my Wife was in Prison at the Suit of one Mary Powel , who is in Jayl on a Charge of Perjury . Counsel . Was you acquitted or not at the Assizes ? Drinkwater . No body appear 'd against me at the Assizes ; but I was mov 'd from Chelmsford to Hartford Jayl , by one Campbel , who calls himself an Attorney Counsel . Did you ever hear them declare what they would do ? Drinkwater . When I was discharged , I came up to London , and had a long Fit of Sickness ; and after I had preferr 'd a Bill against Wills , and he was taken up , Warwick came into a Publick House and threaten 'd me - C. They are indicted for conspiring to charge you with robbing Baws , - speak to that . Drinkwater . When I apprehended Baws , I asked him , how he could do such a cruel Thing ? He said , he had never seen me in his Life , but he had heard of , and was privy to , the Conspiracy ; and , says he , I did not swear it my self , - they got some body to personate me ; and he inform 'd me , that they threaten 'd him , if he would not swear against me , they would swear against him . Since that they have often apply 'd to me to make the Matter up , ( tho ' not in Person , ) but I always shunn 'd them , - I always avoided them . Counsel Def . Where had you this Discourse with Baws ? Drinkwater . At one Mrs. Best 's in Sheer-Lane . There was one Mr Wills present , at that Time , but he is attending the Society for Reformation of Manners at Bow Church . Warwick . I ask if he did not send me Letters from Chelmsford ? Drinkwater . If I did , produce them : I did send him some Letters , to ask him how he could be so cruel , and to desire him to discharge my Wife ; but never to ask him to come to me . Warwick . Was there any Company present when I talk 'd to you in Chelmsford Jayl about discharging you ? Drinkwater . No ; every one , but your Company was put out of the room ; there was none but you , and Wills , and I . Counsel Def . I would not willingly ask you any Questions , to draw you into Difficulties , - but consider , you are upon your Oath . - Have you never threaten 'd to put others into this Indictment ? Drinkwater . No , Sir ; none but what were concern 'd . Counsel Def . Have you never receiv 'd Money from others , to prevent their being charg 'd ? Drinkwater . Never , one Farthing Counsel Def . Did not you send to Wills by one John Morris , and offer , that if he would give you two Guineas , you would give him a Release ? Drinkwater . Not for two Guineas , nor any such Sum . I was spoke to , by several People , who have offer 'd me divers Sums Counsel Def . Did not you send one Lydia Clark to Wills ? Drinkwater . Never in my Life . Counsel Def . Did not you take Money from her ? Drinkwater . I never saw a Farthing of her Money ; nor did I ever send any body to Wills . Morris and Atkins has spoke to me , but I never spoke to them first . Sir Richard Brocas 's Clerk has asked me about it , but I said , I would never agree with any of them . Counsel Def . Did not you threaten to put others into this Conspiracy ? Drinkwater . No , not in this ; but that in Hartfordshire I have . Counsel Def . Have not you declared you would hang him if you could ? Drinkwater . I never mention 'd his Name , or any such Subject . Counsel Def . Have you never said you would hang any of the Defendants ? Drinkwater . No , never . I have said , I believed Warwick would be hang 'd , he was such a prodigious Rogue always . I might say , I believ 'd he would come to it . Counsel Def . Did you never threaten to put Lydia Clark into this Conspiracy ? Drinkwater . No , never in my Life . Warwick . He was on the Back of the Bill when Sayer indicted me for two Robberies in September last , and before that Trial he declared that he would hang me if he could ; if he could not hang me , he would transport me , or keep me in Jayl for Life . Drinkwater . I never said I would do it : I thought you would come to it . Eliz Sayer . I know Wills and Warwick - Baws I know as far as the Action he was concern 'd in . I kept a House in St. Clement 's Church Yard 19 Years , and alter 'd my Business , from a Joyner , Shop , to a Coffee-house . Warwick lodged in my House four Months . On the 3d of April , 1735 , John Wills , John Clark , and Thomas Pritchard , came to Warwick in the Morning ; I shew 'd them into the Room where he lay , he had been drunk the Day before , so was a-bed . They told him they had got Drinkwater 's Watch ; he got up in the Bed , and call 'd upon God to d - mn him , and told them they must keep it , and must keep him poor . Afterwards I heard that Drinkwater had got a Warrant for the four Men , who came together to Warwick , and he told them he had arrested Drinkwater in an Action of 40 l. I asked him how he could do such a Thing ? and he said he could get People enough to swear it . After he ( Drinkwater ) was arrested for Debt , there was one Tibbalds the younger , informed Warwick , that Drinkwater was making an Information against him , for Robberies which had been committed in his House , and upon that Account , they all contriv 'd to get him out of the Way . After many Consultations , ( at which Warwick , Wills , Clark , Pritchard , Curtis , Joyce , and Williams , were all present , ) Joyce brought the Prisoner Baws to them , and told them , there was the Man that would do it : I heard every thing upon this terrible Occasion . The Substance of the Discourse was to get a Robbery sworn against Drinkwater . Pritchard was not in their Company when Baws was first brought in , but all the rest of them were ; and Warwick asked Baws , whether he would undertake to swear a Robbery against Drinkwater ; Baws said , Yes , he would : Then they asked him how much Money he must have ; he said , they must give him 20 s. Whether it was Warwick or some of the Company that ask 'd the Question , I can not remember , but it was some of the Company . They ask 'd him next , where he would swear the Robbery was committed , - the whole Affair seem 'd to me to be left to Warwick 's Management , - Baws told them he chose to swear it somewhere about Ham in Essex , because he was best acquainted with that Part of the Country ; they asked him what he would swear he lost , he told them he would swear to his Hat , Wig , a Gold Ring , and under 20 s. for , says he , if I swear to too much , they will not believe me , because I am poor in Apparel , and they will know I have not much Money to lose . At the Time they made this Agreement with Baws , there was seven of them in Company , and they collected 3 s a-piece ; Warwick , Wills , Clark , Williams , Joyce , and Curtis laid down 3s . each , and Pritchard being absent , they laid down 3s . for him . I said it was a sad Thing to hang a Man wrongfully , and Warwick said , G - d D - n him it was no Sin , for if they did not hang him , he would them all . When they had agreed thus far , Baws and Joyce went down to Justice Newton , to get a Warrant of Detainer against Drinkwater , but Justice Newton would have nothing to do with them : then they went to Sir Richard Hopkins , and there they got it , and brought it to Warwick , he was then in Bed , but he got up and said , now G - d D - n him this will hang him . I never slept in my Bed 'till I made Oath of this , before the Lord Chief Justice Ayres , in June following , and I went down to Chelmsford at my own Expence to appear for Drinkwater upon his Trial , but no Body appearing against him , Campbel the Lawyer came down , and ( as I heard afterwards ) carried him to Hertford Goal . Counc . Pros . Then they never pretended that he was guilty . Sayer . No , they said they must do it to save their own Lives . They talked to Baws about his Cloaths , and told him when he went to the Assizes he should be better rigg 'd , and should be well drest : There was six of them in Company , and they paid 3 s. each , round the Table , and one of them laid down 3s . for Pritchard ; the odd Shilling he was to have to buy him a Dinner . Q . After they had got the Warrant of Detainer , what happen 'd next ? Sayer . When they had got the Warrant to detain him , Baws said , I do n't know the Man , it will be very proper I should have a Sight of the Man I am to swear against . Warwick describ 'd him , his Cloaths , his Speech , and every Thing , very particularly ; but Baws said , that will not do , I must see him ; then they all six agreed to send a Letter to him , and Drinkwater was to be call 'd down in the Compter to receive it , but when Baws came there and asked for him , his Wife answer 'd for him , and he did not see him . He came back and told them that he had not seen him ; upon which they all agreed that he should see him when they remov 'd him to Chelmsford . The next Business was to get an Habeas Corpus , I do n't know what it cost them , but they all agreed to club for it . Counc . Pros . Pray what is Warwick ? Warwick . I was an old - Acquaintance - of hers , she and I cohabited together as Man and Wife . You 'll please to take Notice that all this which she swears was done in Middlesex , and we are now indicted in London . Counc . I remember a Trial in this Court some Time ago ; this Woman tried Warwick for a Felony , with relation to the Goods in that House in St. Clements Church Yard . Counc . Warwick was indicted for stealing her Goods , but it came out , that they liv 'd together as Man and Wife , so it prov 'd to be no Felony . Sayer . It was my Misfortune to let him a Lodging in my House . - Counc . Def You have told a very long Story , Madam ; and you have an excellent Memory . Can you tell whether any Body talk 'd about the Money but Baws and Warwick ? Sayer All the Persons I have nam 'd were present , and they all join 'd for the Money in my one Pair of Stairs Room , in St. Clements Churchyard . Counc.Def . That is in Middlesex . Sayer . I believe it is . Catherine Drinkwater . When my Husband was arrested in Warwick 's sham Action , Joyce told me if I assisted him , I should be arrested before the Week was out , and accordingly I was arrested at the Suit of Lydia Goodwin alias Clark , and just before the Assizes , they sent me to Newgate . Warwick said they must confine me , that my Husband might be starv 'd in Goal ; and in the Officers House he told me , if I would sign a Bond , and oblige my self not to assist my Husband , the Plaintiffs should discharge me . Wills was by at the same Time , they were both drinking Punch at Mr. Lepards in Wharton-Court , Holborn , on this side the Bars , nearer London then Middlesex . He told me I might thank my Black-guard Husband for my being arrested . I was then big with Child , and had not an Hour to go , when they hurry 'd me to Newgate , and there I was brought to bed . Their Intent was to distress my Husband in Jayl , in order to bring him to sign Releases , that they might not be prosecured for what they had done . Warwick . Ask her what 's her Way of Life , and her Husband 's ? C. Drinkwater . My Husband is a Sadler by Trade ; and since he came out of Jayl , he has been supported by Friends . I lay 9 Months , and he 12 Months in Jayl . Warwick . Ask her if she is not a common Prostitute ? Counc . Pros . And pray what are we to ask you ? Mr. North . On Monday April 16 . 1735 , when Drinkwater was in the Compter , one Christopher Baws came before Sir Richard Hopkins ; I ca n't swear positively it was the Prisoner , - I have been looking at him , and it was such a sort of a Man , but I ca n't swear positively to him at this distance of Time , nor can I say positively whether his Information was taken in Writing ; I think it was not , but I have these Memorandums which I took from the Book . The Party accused was in Custody in the Compter , and he not being brought before Sir Richard , was the Occasion I believe of it 's not being taken in Writing . Counc . Def If there was an Information taken in Writing , that only must be read . Counc . Pros . If there was an Information , 't is now out of the Way ; and shall we not read there Minutes which are the Ground and Substance of what was then sworn , and out of which , if there was an Information , that Information was fram 'd ? Mr. North , I think is a competent Witness , and we are in the common , usual Course of Evidence . Mr. North . Baws swore before Sir Richard Hopkins , that Drinkwater had robb 'd him , - I forget the Place , but 't was somewhere in Essex , of his Hat , Wig , a gold Ring , and 13 s. in Money , these are the Words in my Memorandum . Upon this there was a Warrant of Detainer granted , and Baws enter 'd into a Recognizance of 40 l to prosecute him next Assizes . I never saw Baws till that Time ; Drinkwater came to me 3 or 4 Months ago , and asked me if I could recollect any Thing of this Transaction , and I described the Prisoners Person to him , and I think he answers the Description . Thomas Smith . Keeper of Woodstreet Compter . This is the Warrant of Detainer ; I ca n't remember who brought it to me , but Drinkwater was then in Custody on an Action for Debt . Mr. North The Body of this Warrant is my own Writing , the Signing was by Sir Richard himself . I deliver 'd it into Baws Hands . London . To the Keeper of Woodstreet Compter . Detain in your Custody the Body of John Drinkwater , charged before me , on Oath of Christopher Baws , for assaulting him on the Highway in the County of Essex , and taking from him a Hat , a Wig , a gold Ring , and 13 s. in Money and him keep in safe Custody , 'till he shall be discharged by due Course of Law : given under my Hand and Seal , April 16 , 1735. Richard Hopkins . Smith . Drinkwater was brought to us the 3 d or 4th of April , and the Action was discharged two or three Days after the Detainer came . He did not stay long with us , before the Habeas Corpus came , by which he was carry 'd to . Essex . Mr. Ray brought it to me , and by Virtue of that , I carry 'd him to Chelmsford . Warwick and Wills I met at Stratford ; I thought they were coming towards London . Drinkwater . Did not they both go some Miles with us hallowing on the Road ? Smith . No , neither of them . I do n't know that they went a Yard out of the Way . Drinkwater lives upon the Reversion of a Woman ; he is a common Sharper , and his Wife is a common Strumpet about the Streets . I should give no Credit to him ; but should be asham 'd of being seen in his Company . Wm Ray . About a Year and a half ago , I was sent for to Wills 's House in Fet er-Lane , and was desired to bring a Habeas Corpus for John Drinkwater . There was Warwick , Wills , Joyce , and others present . This was in Fetter-lane , London . Baws was not there at that Time , but they told me , he was the Prosecutor . I said I would bring an Habeas , if the Prosecutor would give it under his Hand ; he did so , and that 's the Man at the Bar . This is the Paper he sign 'd before me . Clerk reads . Christopher - Baws his Mark . Witness , John Wills . I do hereby authorize you to bring an Habeas Corpus for John Drinkwater , for robbing me on the King 's Highway in the County of Essex , and for which I have charged him on a Warrant of Detainer in Wood-street Compter . For your so doing this shall be your sufficient Warrant . Ray . I wanted to know who was to be at the Expence ; and as far as I could apprehend , they all joyn 'd . There was six of them in all ; Warwick , Wills , Joyce , Meads , and two or three more . This was in London . Richard Broomhall . Drinkwater became a Prisoner at Warwick 's Suit for 40 l. I went with Smith and Drinkwater to Chelmsford , and Clark was with us . I saw Warwick and Wills on the Road . I cut Drinkwater a Stick , to get his Horse along , to defend himself with . Counsel . What is the Character of the Prosecutor ! Broomball . Why truly , they are pretty much alike , I know'em all , and I look on the Characters of one to be as bad as the other . Ann Thorp . Warwick came to me one Day , and asked me if I would be something toward moving Drinkwater into the Country , he wanted me to be a Guinea , and at last 10 s. toward the Charge ; but I refused to contribute . Warwick . This Woman was committed with Kate Buck , who was transported some Time ago , and she keeps a common Bawdy-House in Red-Lyon Court . One of her Husbands was my Follower my Lord . The Prosecutor has got me fix 'd already in Newgate for Recognizances at the Suit of the King . John Clark . Drinkwater wanted me to swear against the Prisoners , but I told him I knew nothing of this Matter , then he threatned to have me in Goal , and knowing him to be a dangerous Fellow , I took a Release from him and gave him half a Guinea . Wilkinson . This is John Clark 's Release from Drinkwater ; he was afraid of being call 'd to account for Drinkwater 's being sent to Chelmsford , so Mr. Francis said he would endeavour to get him a Release . Clark said he knew they had been at 80 l. Charge in pursuing Drinkwater , and knew more than any other of the Conspiracy ; so I wrote to Drinkwater and he gave him a Release on Consideration he should give Evidence against the Prisoners in a generous Manner . I know of no Money given on this Occasion , only Mr. Francis gave me a Guinea and half to supersede his Wife out of Prison ; whence it came I do n't know . I do n't believe Drinkwater had any Money given him . John Clark . Drinkwater said to me , that if Wills would give him a Guinea or two , he should not be try 'd . He is a dangerous Man , and his Wife is a common Strumpet . Margaret Boucher . Last Saturday I met Drinkwater in the Old Bailey ; how do you do says he ; never the better for you says I , because you have robb 'd me of so much ; so says he , because you have not sworn against Warwick and Wills , I will swear against you ; and some time ago , I heard him say , he would hang Warwick , because he had turn 'd him out of his Place . I did live with Mr. Warwick , but now I live in Shoe-Lane , and am a Hair picker . I liv 'd in a House which Mr. Warwick hired next Door to his House in Shoe-Lane , and us 'd to drink a Glass of Wine or two in his House , now and then . At the White Lyon in Shoe Lane he told me , - Peggy , if you 'll swear against Warwick and Wills for the Highway , you shall have a share of the Reward , and that will make you for ever . Edmund Woodhouse . Drinkwater told me in Chelmsford Jayl , that if ever he liv 'd to get out , he would hang Warwick and two more . Drinkwater . That Man 's a Smuggler : He was in Jayl for assaulting the King 's Officers . Joseph Cook . I know Sayer , but upon my Life I do n't know any thing of her Character ; only Warwick and she liv 'd together as Man and Wife . I have heard Warwick say , he knew no more of this Matter than the Pope of Rome . Wm Meads , Drinkwater is a notorious Fellow , for some Time ago he got a Woman to indict me Drinkwater The Characters of all these People , if you 'll enquire into them , are as bad as , or worse than , that they give me . This Man has some particular Friends of his at Kennington-Common Q . Who 're they ? Drinkwater Some Friends hanging in Chains , Sam Roberts . I have known Wills 6 or 7 Years , and I know the Characters of many of the People here . Counsel Pros . Have you never heard Wills had a bad Character ? Roberts . Yes , just now , - heard ! yes . I ca n't say as to hearing . - I am a Weaver at Norton Folgate . John Perry . Roger Downes and Mary Price , spake to Will 's Character . Counsel . Did you know Wills when Alderman Parsons was Mayor ? Did you hear no ill of him then ? Did not you hear that he was then call 'd down to this Place ? Price . No . Counsel . Tis strange you should not hear of it , when 't was so publick . Also Jane Wood , Robert Farr , Edward Bracey , Thomas Butler , Richard Crew , Thomas Rose , and James Pye , gave Wills a good Character . John Phillips , Warwick 's Taylor , said he always paid him for his Work , and that was all he knew . Joseph Cook . Warwick was honest to me , I have known him 3 or 4 Years . I have heard he kept Women , he had one in St. Clement 's Church-yard . Charles Smith gave him a good Character . For Baws no one appear 'd . - Jones . I know when I was Constable , - that was in Alderman Parson 's Mayoralty , they were all of them very bad People . William Walpole . Mr. Francis told Drinkwater he would put him in Goal for Debt , if he would not give Clark a general Release ; so rather than go to Goal he did . Drinkwater I never conversed with Margaret Boucher since March last When I liv 'd with Warwick she was one of his Women : she has been try 'd in this Court for several Felonies , and is now a common Street Walker C Why , truly I think we are in very bad Company on both Sides .

William Weaving I can only say I lost the Plates the 5th of Jan when I was out upon the Inquest , and I swear to them . A Witness . I went into the Yard , and saw the Prisoner there ; I asked her what Business she had there , she said she only wanted to make a little Water , but I saw the Plates in her Apron , and she rattled them down in the Dust Tub , which stood in the Yard ; she had brought them about 6 or 7 Yards from the Place where they stood ! This was between 12 and 1 o'Clock . Defence . I have nothing to say , - I never ow 'd that Witness any ill Will , nor did she ever see me in the Yard : I had been out to buy some Bone to mend my old Stays , and wanting to make Water , I stepp 'd up the Yard , and there I was charg 'd with stealing those Plates . She has ow 'd me a Grudge , for more than 12 Months . Acquitted . 38 , Elizabeth Jones , of St. Mary Whitechappel , was indicted for stealing 2 Chints Bed-Curtains , value 50 s. and a Chints Bed Quilt , value 40 s . the Goods of Elizabeth Wroth , May 18 . Mary Ward . I live at Lady Wroth 's at Golden-Hill . When I went to Bed at Night , I made all the Doors and Windows fast ; but in the Morning when I came down , I found a Door open ; being surpriz 'd , I call 'd a Neighbour and went over the House , and found two of the Chints Curtains , two Quilts , and a red Sattin Mantle gone out of one Room : a little further a Box-lid broke , and the Papers which were in the Box scatter 'd about the Room . I ca n't say any Thing to the Prisoner . Judith Gentry Confirm 'd the above Evidence . Mary Ward . I saw the Goods in the Room the Day before . There was one Quilt cover 'd the Bed , and another was doubled up and lay upon that , and covered that . Mrs. Theodorick . The Prisoner brought me two Bed Curtains , and a Quilt last Summer , and offer 'd them to sell . Prisoner . O Lord ! Let her look at me , - swear her again my Lord , - swear her again . Theodorick . I agreed with her for three Guineas which she took , and told me they were a Gentlewoman 's who was ill and was reduced . They were snipp 'd and torn at the Top , but that she said was done by the Rats . These are the very Things . Prisoner . O Lord ! Lord ! I never saw these Thing , 'till this Moment . Theodorick . I believe these to be the same , but they have been piec 'd and made up again ; there was not this Lining in them , and they are thus much lengthen 'd , - here they seemed to be gnaw 'd . Prisoner . She must be a good one , to buy such Things of a Stranger . Theodorick . She told me they had lain by a great while , and the Rats had gnaw 'd them , but now the Lady would sell them , for she wanted Money . Prisoner . A Lady - and want Money , - O Lord ! - a fine Lady ! Robert Theodorick . These Things were advertised ; so when I saw the Advertisement , I went to Mr. Sly 's , at the Blue Boar in Whitechappel , and took a Friend with me , who happen 'd to be in the Shop when my Wife bought the Goods , but this Man is now in Yorkshire . I told Mr. Sly , that my Spouse had happen 'd to buy these Things ; he desired me to send for them ; which I did , and he Paid me the three Guineas my Love had paid for them , and treated us with two bottles of Wine . I promised him to bring the Prisoner as soon as I could light of her , and accordingly I carry 'd her to him and she could not disown the Goods , neither at Mr. Sly 's , nor before the Justice . She made many Protestations that she bought them in Rag-Fair , but she could not say who she bought them of . I know nothing at all of the Prisoner , nor do I know that ever I had seen her before Prisoner . Swear him , whether they ever mention 'd Quilt and Curtains to me , before I was carry 'd to the Justice ? Theodorick . No , I believe they were not mention 'd till then . Prisoner . She buys of 40 People in a Day , my Lord . Mrs. Theodorick . Yes , I believe I do ; and I have bought Things of her once or twice before . Prisoner . Yes , Shirts and Shifts , and Gowns and Petticoats ; we carry our Goods in our Arms publickly . These things are of a great Bulk ; did any of her Neighbours see her buy them of me ? Theodorick . No , There was only one Man in the Shop , and he is in the Country . I take the Prisoner to be the Person that sold them to me : I swear that I believe her to be the Person . Prisoner . The most Money I ever took of her , was 15 s. for Shirts and Shifts - These Things are beyond my Match to buy . Mrs. Wroth . These Things are mine ; I miss 'd them the 11th of May . Since I recover 'd them again , I have new lin 'd them , and made them up . They are Chints , and not to be match 'd . Prisoner . I cry old Cloaths , and I buy honestly . I never saw these Things before , - Swear them again , swear them , my Lord . Elizabeth Cooper , and Margaret Ingram , gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest Woman . Acquitted . 39.

About 12 o'Clock last Night , I met that little one ( Slater ) at Temple-Bar ; she asked me to give her a Glass of Wine ; I told her , my Pocket would not afford it ; then says she , you may give me some Beer . So we went to the Coach and Horses at Temple-bar , and had 3 Pints of Beer . The other Prisoner , and another Woman that is run away , wanted me to go into a Back Room , and I went with them , and there we had another Full Pot ; then the biggest of the Prisoners ( Dryberry ) stood before me , and the others on each Side of me , and pick 'd my Pocket , of a Three Pound Twelve Piece , a Moidore and a Shilling . I had all the Money in my Hand about two Minutes before - I had it when I sat down , and when I got up it was gone . The Buttons were in the Pocket with my Money , but they were gone too . One of them was found upon Slater , and I saw them in her Hands . Dryberry . Was I near you when you miss 'd your Money ? Whitehead . Yes ; you stood before me , and pull 'd up your Coats : 'T was you that desired me to go into the Back Room . Dryberry . I was drinking a pint of Beer , and the Man and this Slater came in together , and we drank together ; but when I would go home , he started up and said , he had lost his Money ; I said , I had not wrong 'd him , but he call 'd the Watch , tho ' I saw none of his Money , nor do I know the Man .

Middlesex , was indicted , for that Samuel Broughton , on the 16 of Sept about the Hour of 12 at Night , having stolen 6 yards of Cloth , val . 21 s. the Goods of Jacob Chitty , then fix 'd on certain Racks and Tenters ; he the said Allen afterwards , viz . on the 17 of Sept . 3 yards , parcel of the said Cloth did receive , knowing it to be stole . Mr. Satchwell In September last I was robb 'd of six Yards of Cloth , the Property of Mr. Chitty Samuel Broughton was taken up for another robbery , and he informed Mr Davis , that the Prisoner Allen had three Yards of this Cloth I went to him , and he told me he had no such Thing . I told him I must search his House ; and when he found I had a search Warrant , he sent his Man to search for it , and he brought us these three Yards of Cloth . Here it is , and this is the other Part from whence it was cut ; 't is rough , and is not yet manufactur 'd . Councel . Did not Mr. Allen say , he was not at Home when it was pledged at his House ? Satchwell . He said his Man took it in , and blam 'd him for it . I asked him why he did not advertise it ; and he made no answer at all . C. You say he blam 'd his Man for taking it in ; on what Account did he blame him ? Satchwell . He said the Goods were not manufactur 'd , and any body might see they had been stole . Councel . Was his Man by , at this Time ? Satchwell . Yes , and he own 'd he took it in . Councel . I would ask you whether Mr. Allen was not bound over to prosecute the Principal Felon . Satchwell . Yes , he was . Counsel . Did you prefer this Bill , before , or after his being bound over to prosecute ? Satchwell . Afterwards I did , and I went with a Warrant to take him up , once or twice myself , and I sent several People to ask for him ; but I was told he had secreted himself ; he might have taken his Trial last Sessions . George Davis . In October last I went to New-Prison to see Broughton , and I asked him if he knew any Thing of Satchwells Goods , and he told me , he had stole some from him , and that 3 Yards were pawn 'd to a Pawnbroker in Smock-Alley . I told Satchwell of this , and he got a Search Warrant , and Mr. Allen read the Warrant himself . I was there at the same Time , Mr. Allen said he had no such Goods as he knew of , but when Satchwell insisted on searching , then Mr. Allen bid his Man go up and look , the Man went up Stairs , and brought down these very Goods ; Satchwell own 'd them immediately , and Mr. Allen said , any one might see those Goods were not honestly come by , and he told us he was not at Home when they were brought , but that his Man had taken them in , in his absence . The Man own 'd he took the Goods in . - Barnes , Constable . I know nothing of these Goods , but I believe Mr Allen to be a very honest Man . There was a Watch lost some Time ago ; and 't was pawn 'd with him ; I had , ( upon Enquiry ) such a Character of him , that I only asked him about it , and he immediately deliver 'd it to me . Mrs. Vane . I was robb 'd some Time ago by a Servant ; and I went to Mr. Allen 's and enquir 'd after my Goods , he desir 'd me to call again in 2 or 3 Hours ; I did , and he deliver 'd me all the Things , without any Trouble . Thomas Bullmore . Last August I lost a Watch , and was inform 'd it was pawn 'd at Mr. Allen 's : I got Barnes the Constable to go with me with 2 Search Warrant to his House , but the Justice told me he was so worthy an honest Man , that we should have no need of using the Warrant ; he has in his Neighbourhood a universal good Character . Michael Allcock . I liv 'd with Mr. Allen at this Time , and I took in these 3 Yards of Cloth , my Master being out . I had liv 'd there not half a Year , and was never in the Business before . Broughton brought it , I did not know him , nor did I ever see him before . Coun . Did you acquaint your Master with the Receipt of this Cloth . Allcock . No , upon my Oath , when Mr. Satchwell and Davis came to enquire after it , that was the first Time he knew any Thing of it . It had not been in the House above a Month . We book the Things that are receiv 'd , but my Master seldom looks over the Goods that are pledg 'd , 'twould be an endless Trouble to do that . I took Broughton to be a Dyers Servant , and told him , 't was not well of him to use another 's Goods , but he told me the Cloth was his own , and was sent him out of the Country . When Mr. Satchwell came to ask for it , my Master asked me if I knew of any such Thing ; I said yes , and by his Order , I went up and fetch 'd it . Satchwell . When I enquired after the Cloth , the Man said nothing of his remembering it , but went up Stairs and brought it down . ( Here the Record of Broughton 's Conv ction was read ) Counsel . We shall shew this is most inveterate Malice . When the principal Felon was taken up , Mr. Allen was desired to enter into a Recognizance to prosecute ; he did so , and by this Indictment the Recognizance is forfeited . Mr. Mawson . Headborough . I went with Satchwell to search Mr. Allen 's House . When we enquired for the Cloth , he hesitated a little , and asked his Man about it ; he bid him go up and see if there was any such Thing , and he brought it down to us ; but Mr. Allen reproved him for taking it in .
