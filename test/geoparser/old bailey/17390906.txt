Phillis Grindall . On the 15th of August , about Nine o'Clock at Night , I was going down the Minories , with this Bundle of Linnen , and the Prisoner dogged me ; sometimes he was on one Side of me , sometimes on the other , and sometimes he was at my Heels . When I had got about 10 Doors past the Corner , at the Bottom of the Minories , he snatched hold of the Bundle ; I screamed out - Murder ! - Stop Thief , I am ruined ! I held fast , and he pulled , and I pulled . In the Struggle I fell down ; and the violence of the Fall stopped my Breath , and broke my Elbow , in such a Manner , that I could not use my Arm for a Fortnight . When I got up , the Prisoner was got away with the Bundle , but I still cry 'd out , stop Thief ! and the Prisoner was taken by the Merchant Taylors Alms-Houses , about twenty or thirty Yards from the Place where he robbed me , and then some People came to me , and bid me not cry out , for the Man ( they said ) was taken . There was four Holland Shifts , three Callico Shirts , five Linnen Aprons , and a Dimitty Petticoat in the Bundle , and they were the Property of Mary Chaplin . He took the Goods from me just by a Lamp , by which I saw the Side of his Face , and I observed him as he followed me down the Minories , and imagining he had some ill design , I held my Bundle as fast as I could . I took Notice of the Prisoner 's Cloaths the next Morning , and they were the same that he has on now . Samuel Nott , junior . About a Quarter after Nine at Night , my Father and I were standing at my Door , and we heard this young Woman cry out Murder ! Stop Thief ! I saw the Prisoner tugging the Bundle from her , and I thought they were Man and Wife , and might be quarrelling . But when he took to his Heels with the Bundle , I pursued him , and overtook him about thirty Yards from the Place where he took it , upon which he flung it down , and it struck me upon my Thigh . I picked it up with my left Left Hand , and with my Right I seiz 'd the the Prisoner . This is the same Bundle the Prisoner then dropped . Grindall . This is the Bundle he took from me ; 't is just as it was , when it was taken , and these are the same Things which were then in it . Prisoner . Ask Mr. Nott , if I attempted to stir ; for I was so much in Liquor , that I could not stand . Nott . I never saw the Prisoner before that Night , in my Life . When I laid hold of him with my Right Hand , my Father seized him on the other Side , and told him , if he offered to make any Resistance he would knock him down with an Oaken Stick , which he had in his Hand . Upon which the Prisoner said , - Mr. Nott , I will not resist . Prisoner . Ask Grindall whether she is not persuaded to prosecute me , by Mr. Nott ; and whether the Prosecution is not carry 'd on it his Expence ? Grindall . No body persuaded me to prosecute ; But as the Prisoner and the Goods were taken , we were all obliged to prosecute : We went before the Lord-Mayor , and he bound us all over . Mr. Nott , senior . I was standing that Night at the Door , talking with my Son , and Hearing a Cry of Murder ! Stop Thief ! I turned my Head , and saw the Prisoner run with the Bundle under his Arm . I cross 'd the Way and caught him by the right Shoulder . He had dropped the Bundle and was got a little Way from it , but we dragg 'd him to it , and my Son took it up . The Prisoner seemed to be at that time as sober as I am now . Mary Berry . The Linnen was my Mistress 's Mary Chaplin 's ; she lives in Aldermanbury . I delivered the Things to Grindall a little after Eight o'Clock at Night , in order to their being wash 'd ; and she was then carrying them home . DEFENCE . A Witness . I live opposite to the Prisoner 's Father : He is a very honest Lad , as far as I know . He makes Backs for Distillers and Brewers , and has been out of his Time about four or five Years . When he has any Business , he will work ; but since the Commencement of the Gin Act , his Trade has been dead . I saw him that Afternoon at work in a Distillers 's Shop ; and I saw him again , vastly fuddled , between Five and Six o'Clock . Another . I have known him thirteen or fourteen Years , and have drank with him in his Father 's House . I saw him that Afternoon , about two o'Clock , at the Rosemary Branch , pretty near his Father 's House , in Rosemary-Lane ; he was much in Liquor , and was quarreling with a Woman , who was beating him . Several other Witnesses appeared to the Prisoner 's Character ; who never heard any Ill of him before . Some of them declared , they did not know what Business he had followed this last half Year , but they imagined his Father maintained him . A Constable likewise deposed , That Mr. Nott desired him to take Charge of the Prisoner , on account of this Robbery , and he ( the Prisoner ) was very much fuddled , and deny 'd the Fact . Another Constable mentioned something of a Fray the Prisoner had been in , and for which he had been put in the Compter ; but he had not heard of his having wrong 'd any body . Prisoner . I might be in Liquor , and might run against the Woman , there 's not a Man on Earth , can lay any Dishonesty to my Charge , before this Time . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty of the Indictment , but recommended him to his Majesty 's Clemency . Death . 431. Joseph Richardson was indicted for stealing 28 lbs of Sugar , val . 5 s. the Goods of Colin Campbell and David Curry , in the Parish of St. Dunstan in the East , July 31 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 432. John Albin was indicted for assaulting Ann Price and Hannah Prior , in a certain Field , and open Place near the King 's Highway , putting them in fear , and taking a Gold Ring , val . 18 s. and 17 s. in Money , the Property of John Price , from the Person of Ann his Wife ; and a brass Ring . val . an Halfpenny , and 2 s. 6 d. in Money , the Property of Thomas Prior , from the Person of Hannah his Wife , May 21 . Ann Price . On the 21st of May last , Mrs . Prior and I were coming from Kilburn towards London , between Three and Four o'Clock in the Afternoon , and the Prisoner met us about two or three Fields from Mary-bone : He came in at one End of the Field , and we come in at the other . The Minute I saw him , I had a Dread upon me that he would rob us ; for he came on with a sauntering Pace , and had a Stick in his Hand : I said to Mrs . Prior , - we shall certainly be robb 'd ! No , said she , I hope not , - pray take Courage . When the Prisoner came up to us , I call 'd out , - Tom Prior , Tom Prior ( which is Mrs . Prior 's Husband 's Name ) - you sha'n't go abroad with us any more , if you must stay behind to look Birds-nests . Mr Prior was not with us , but I said this , that the Prisoner might imagine he was not far off ; and upon this he pass 'd by us , and went about twenty or thirty Yards beyond us ; then he turn 'd about and follow 'd us , and when he overtook us , he said , - Aye , God damn you , Madam , I 'll give you something besides Birds-nests , and immediately he put his right Hand into his left Side-pocket , and pulled out a Pistol of a very uncommon Size , and clapp 'd it to my left Breast , crying damn you , Madam , your Money and Rings . I had none but my Wedding ring , which I pull 'd off , and told him , I had no other , except that , which was my Wedding-ring , and he should have it ; when he had got it , he still kept his Pistol to my Breast , and stamping with his Foot on the Ground , he cry 'd , - d-mn you , your Money ; then I put my Hand into my Pocket , and pull 'd out about seven Shillings , some Half-pence , and a Cork-screw , which he threw at me again . After this , he stamp 'd again , and said to Mrs . Prior , - And D-mn you , Madam , your Money : I saw her give him some Money , but how much I can not tell . All the while he was demanding Mrs . Prior 's Money , and taking it from her , he kept the Pistol to my Breast ; and when he had got what he could , he said , - Now , damn you , go on , and you 'll meet two more presently ; this struck such a Terror into us , than we ran out of the Path way , a-cross the Fields , and over two or three Ditches , to a Farm-house , kept by one Mr. Francis , and when we got there , we were ready to die . I never saw the Prisoner before that Time , but I am positive he is the Man . He was taken up for another Robbery , and I went to see him in Newgate , and knew him immediately : He has got a Wig on now , but he had none when he robb 'd us ; his Hat was flapp 'd , and he had a Bough which he play 'd about in his Mouth . When I saw him in Newgate , he abus 'd me , and call 'd me several Bitches , when he found I knew him . Thomas Adams , a Constable of Pancras . I had a Warrant brought me from Mr. Deveil , against the Prisoner , by Mr. Griffin , on Suspicion of breaking open his Shop , and stealing a Parcel of Books . I took him ( I think ) on the 9th of August , in his Father 's Hay-loft , at Tottenham-Court , pretty near the Turnpike , where I found him hid behind the Hay . I did not know any thing of this Robbery then , nor have I had any Discourse with him concerning it since . He made no Confession of any Kind to me ; but he seem 'd to be under a great Surprize when I took him , and made but little Resistance . This Witness inform 'd the Court , that Hannah Prior was taken with an Apoplectick Fit the Day before this Trial came on ; and that he call 'd at her House , as he came to the Court , and found her but just alive . Prisoner . I have no Witnesses to call . I never did any such thing in my Life ; and 't is hard to take away my Life for nothing at all . I never was guilty of such a thing , as God 's my Saviour , and you my Judge . Guilty , Death . 433. John Albin was a second Time indicted , with Fortunatus Albin , his Brother , for stealing a printed Book , called the Craftsman , being a Critique on the Times . Vol . II . val . 1 s. one other Book called the Craftsman , & c. Vol . III . val . 1 s. one other Book , called the Craftsman , & c. Vol . IV . val . 1 s and several other Books , to a considerable Value , the Goods of William Griffin , in his Shop , Aug. 2 . John Albin Guilty , Fortunatus Acquitted . 434. was indicted for stealing two Silk Skirts of a Child 's Coat , val . 2s . 6d . and other Cloaths , the Goods of Mary Gray ; and a Pair of Cloth Breeches , val . 8 s. and several other Things , the Property of Jeremiah Gray , Aug. 15 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 435. Edward Goynes , alias Joynes of Stepney , was indicted , for that he , not having GOD before his Eyes , & c. on the 15th of July , in and upon Mary his Wife did make an Assault , and with both his Hands , her upon the Throat , feloniously , maliciously , and of his Malice aforethought , did squeeze and press , giving her , by squeezing and pressing as aforesaid , a mortal Bruise , of which mortal Bruise , from the 15th to the 20th of July she languished , and languishing lived , and then died . He was a second Time charged , by vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest , for the Murder of his said Wife . Martha Cadmore . The Prisoner and the Deceased lived at Poplar . On the 15th of July , between Ten and Eleven in the Morning , I was going by his Door , and hearing a Noise in the House , I went in , and found the Wife of the Prisoner sitting in a Chair , by the Chimney Corner , in the Ground-Room , - the Shop , as they call 'd it , where they sold Greens ; she was holding one Arm with the other , and cry 'd , O that wicked Villain ! that wicked Villain has wrung my Arm to Pieces ! The Prisoner was present , and said , - Did I do it , you old Toad ? I only flung a Pint of Beer at you . I look 'd down , and there was indeed a Slop upon the Ground by her . I did not stay long with her , but went home to my own House , about four Doors from the Prisoner 's ; and in about two Hours Time I heard an Outcry again , upon which I return 'd , and saw the Deceased 's Face all over gore Blood ; he had drove her in that Condition out into the Street , and she cry 'd , - O that Villain , - now he has done my Business ! This was on the 15th of July , and I saw her no more from the 15th to Friday the 20th , and I happen 'd to call to see her that Day , before she died . While I was then with her , he came up into the Room , and put his Arm under her Back , to raise her up ; and , Gammer ( says he to her , I think that was the Word ) have you any thing to alledge against me ? She shook her Head , and would not have spoke , but he urg 'd her to speak , and in the mean time she had a Convulsion Fit , so he laid her down , and when she came to herself , he asked her again , if she had any thing to lay to his Charge ? Upon this she put her Hand to her Throat , and said , - he had been the Death of her , but she forgave him , if the World would ; the Prisoner immediately said , - That was the Word he wanted . Prisoner . Mrs. Cadmore , did not she fall down and hurt herself ? And when I asked her , whether she had any thing to lay to my Charge , did not she say , - No ? Mrs. Cadmore . About three Weeks or a Month before her Death , ( as near as I can remember ) she fell down and broke her Arm : I do n't remember the Time exactly . Mary Spalding . The Deceased was my Mother . The Prisoner marry 'd her about a Year or 14 Months before she died , and during that time , he us 'd her very barbarously . While I was at home with her , I never saw him strike her with his Hands , but he would heave Stones , Brick-bats , Pans , Pipkins , and Iron Bars at her , and bruise her in a gross Manner . Once he hit her on the Head , - on one Side of her Eye , and she frequently had black Bruises about her , tho ' she did not keep up on these Occasions , because she work 'd for her Bread ; but on the 15th of July he struck her , and did her Business . About Ten or Eleven o'Clock that Morning , my Mother was a-dry ; I went and fetched her a Pot of Beer ; the Prisoner was at the Ale-house right against our House , and seeing the Beer come in , he flew over , and swore he would heave the Pot and the Beer at her : She had the Beer in her Right Hand , he beat it down , and with one Hand he caught hold of her Left Arm , which was lame , and twisted it ; with his other Hand he grasped her Throat , and struck her Head against the Wall . Her Arm was very bad ; but she did not feel much of that , by reason of the Misery she was in with her Throat ; but when the Neighbours came in , she told them , That Rogue had broke her Arm again , - all to Pieces . About two Hours after this , he came in again , ( he had been drinking ) and he buffeted her in the Face with his Hat , till her Eyes ran down with Blood ; and then he call 'd her old Bitch , and bid her go and shew her Marks , and take him up again Tomorrow . Prisoner . O fie upon you Mary ! Spalding . He had cut her in the Head before , ( I ca n't tell how long it was ago ) and she had him taken up for it . The last ill Usage was on Sunday the 15th of July ; on the Tuesday she took to her Bed , and never came down till she was brought down ; she died the 20th . Prisoner . Why Mary , she died on the Friday . Spalding . Well , - that was the 20th . We spoke to a Surgeon about her the same Day that she died , but he did not like the Looks of the Prisoner , and he would not go up Stairs . I did not take Notice of any Marks upon her after she was dead , so I know nothing of Them ; but she complain 'd to the last of her Throat ; he did not hold her by the Throat above half a Minute , yet to the Day she died she could not swallow any thing . She complain 'd likewise of her Back , for something better than a Month before , I saw him give her a Kick on the Back , with some Violence , when she was on the Middle of the Stairs , and she slipped down three Stairs , after which she complain 'd of her Back . Prisoner . Mary , did I kick her down Stairs ? Spalding . Yes . Prisoner . No , my Dear , I never did ; I only beat the Pot of Beer out of her Hand ; I never did any thing else to her ; - there she stands , and knows it . - She says , I buffeted her with my Hat , and made her Eyes bleed ; - she always had sore Eyes . Spalding . When he buffeted her with his Hat , he cut the inside of her Eyes , with the Edge of it . I am sure the Blood came from the Inside ; for her Eyes were afterwards wash 'd , and the Corners were sore , and after I had washed away the Blood , it ouzed out for a Minute or two , - it did not run fast . Catherina Lutolph . I am very sorry I did come to the Place ; I rather had been in Bed , sick , than ( have ) seen such a Sight . The Deceased and I were very great ; she had nobody but me , she could tell her Secrets to ; so on the Tuesday after he had done this Damage , she sent for me . I saw her in a dangerous Condition , and she told me she was very bad ; her Neck was very sore , and she complained very much of her Back . I told her she had catched Cold , - no , no , ( she said ) my Husband came home in a drunken Manner , and pinch 'd my Throat , and struck my Head against the Brick-wall , and it has been my Death . She was a poor Woman , like myself , and she used to go a Shoring ( picking up what she could find upon the Shores , when the Tide was down , for Firing ) and about a Week before this Hurt was done her , she fell down on the Shore , and hurt her Arm , and was very bad with it then , but she now complain 'd of nothing but her Back and her Throat . Prisoner . Mind what you say , Mrs. Dutchwoman . Lutolph . I saw the Deceased on the Wednesday and on the Thursday before she died , and the Prisoner then shew 'd all Love and Kindness to her , and spoke to her as a Husband should speak to a Wife . She bid him go to Work ; but he would make much of her , and sit by her ; then she bid him go away : She did not like to see him , and told him he had done what he should not have done to her . Prisoner . O fie upon you ! Lutolph . On the Day she died he came to her again ; and said , Gammer , Mrs. Fox and Mrs. Poor want to come and see you ; she told him , she did not care to see them ; but I persuaded her to bear no Malice ; so they came with the Prisoner to the Side of the Bed , and he said to the Deceased , - People say I killed you , and that I shall be hanged for you , now tell before Mrs. Fox and Mrs. Poor if I killed you : He took her by the Shoulder to raise her up , and she fell in a Convulsion Fit ; when she came to herself , he asked her Forgiveness ; how can you ( said she ) ask Forgiveness of me ? I will forgive you if the World will . Prisoner . O mind what you say . Lutolph . Yes , I do . - After she said she would forgive him , he turned himself round on his Foot , and said , - a T-rd for you all , that is all I wanted . Before she died , she desired me and another to lay her out , and then we should see ( she said ) what she had gone through ; She died that Day ; we laid her out about Ten o'Clock that Night , and only observ 'd that her Neck was swelled ; but next Morning it was very black a Hand 's Breadth , and as far ( we imagin 'd ) as he had grasp 'd . While she was alive , her Throat was so swell 'd that she could not swallow a Quarter of a Tea-spoonful , nor could she pin her Cap . Prisoner . Did I ever take her by the Throat ? Indeed I did not . Elizabeth Nash . I saw the Deceased about Five in the Morning before she died : She would have eaten a little Milk Porrage , but her Throat was so swell 'd , she could not get a Tea-spoonful down . She told us the Prisoner had pinch 'd her Throat in such a Manner , that it was the Occasion of her Death . Mrs Lutolph and I laid her out , when she was dead ; and I observ 'd several black and blue Marks upon her Legs and her Back ; her Throat was very much swell 'd , and was very black . Prisoner . What did I say to you , when my Dame said , - Gaffer , I am very bad ? Nash . He asked her several Times to forgive him , and she said , she would forgive him , if the World would . She was disturbed at the Sight of him , and did not care to see him . John Clarkson , Surgeon . I view 'd the Body of the Deceased three Days after her Death ; she was terribly bruised all over her Body , from Head to Foot , her Sides and her Back in particular ; and there was a large Tumor on the Left Side of her Throat , which was very black , and which , I imagine , was occasioned by pinching or strangling . The Coats of the Gullet were putrify 'd , and in the Passage into the Stomach there was extravasated Blood , which had turn 'd into Pus or Matter ; and this occasioned the Soreness which prevented her swallowing , and , in my Opinion , was the Cause of her Death . On her Back , between her Shoulders , were some black Places , as broad as the Palm of my Hand , which I imagin 'd were made by beating or kicking . On her left Side , and just under her Breast were great Marks of Violence ; but I did not find her Arm fractur 'd , I believe the Disorder in her Throat might occasion her Death , and that the other ill Usage she had received might hasten it . Prisoner . I must leave it to him and you , my Lord . I have nothing to say , - but I know what I did ; and I only heav 'd the Pot of Beer down , because she did not fetch it where I would have had her . I have no Witnesses , but her Daughter ; please to take it into Consideration , - I 'll be as good as I can to her now . Guilty , Death . 436. Mary Lacock , otherwise Lane , was indicted for stealing a Copper Sauce-pan , val . 8 s. two Blankets , val . 4 s. two Feather Pillows , val . 2 s. and a Smoothing-iron , val . 1 s. the Goods of Michael Hussey , in her Lodging let to her by the said Hussey , Sept.3 . Acquitted . 437. Elizabeth Harrard , of Isleworth , was indicted , for that she being big with a certain Male Child , the said Male Child she did , alone , and secretly , bring forth alive , and which Male Child , by the Laws of this Realm , was a Bastard . And she not having GOD before her Eyes , & c. as soon as the said Male Bastard Child was born , with Force and Arms , on the said Male Bastard Child , so alive , feloniously , & c. did make an Assault , and with both her Hands , the said Child , into a certain River , called the Powder-Mills River , did cast and throw , by reason of which casting and throwing into the said River , the said Child was suffocated and drowned , of which Suffocating and Drowning it instantly died , July 10 . She shas likewise charged , by vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest , for the said Murder . John Thackery . I am Beadle of Isleworth : On Saturday the 14th of July , Mr. Ions , a Farmer there , found a young Child in the Powder-mills River , and I was ordered to go and fetch it . I went , and saw the Child in a Meadow , covered with a little Grass . It had been taken out of the River before I came , and did not seem to be swelled , or to have any Water in its Body ; but on the left side of the Head it had had a Blow ; the Blood was congealed , and the Place was so soft , that I could have thrust my Finger into the Scull : I took it to the Stock-house , and on Monday the Overseers of the Poor sent to Mr Wright , the Coroner , for Letters to bury it . While they were gone , a Woman came to me , and told me she suspected the Prisoner , who worked in the Gardens , and gathered Fruit . I went after her , but did not take her ; the Overseers of Teddington brought her to us , and our Churchwardens ordered me to get her a Bed , because she was not in a fit Condition to be sent to Newgate . On Wednesday the Coroner sat on the Body , and he ordered me to shew it to the Prisoner . She begged I would not bring it near her , for ( said she ) 't is my own Child , - born of my own Body . I asked her how she could tell That , unless she saw it ? She said , it was , and she was very sorry for it : But she did not see it , nor would she suffer me to open the Coffin . When she was first brought to us , we told her under what Circumstances we found the Child , and she did not then say any Thing to it ; but on Thursday Night I sat up with her , and in the Middle of the Night she asked me , if I had been to see after John Gadd ? I told her no , I did not know him . She said he was at Drayton ; that he went there last Monday , and had taken a Field of Wheat to reap ; that she was with him last Sunday Night , and was to have met him again had she not been taken . Elizabeth Nell , Midwife . When the Prisoner was taken , I was sent to examine her . I asked her if she had had a Child ? She said , yes ; she was delivered on the Monday before , in a Field as she was going over a Style , and some Men coming by , she went away and left the Child behind . I told her , that Story did not appear feasible , and asked her if it was born alive ? She said it was not : And I reply 'd I was sure it was born alive by its Head ; for it was very much bruised and swelled , and the Blood was congeal 'd , which I apprehend it would not have been , had it been born dead . After I had told her I was a Midwife , and it would be better for her to tell me the Truth ; she said - then , Mrs. Midwife , I will tell you the Truth : - The Child was born alive , and liv 'd a Quarter of an Hour , but as she was sitting in Pain by the River-side , with the Child in her Lap , it rolled out of her Lap into the Water . I asked her again , how long it liv 'd , and what she wrapp 'd it in ? She said , it lived half an Hour ; that she tore a Piece of her Apron to wrap it , and that it had been dead half an Hour , or an Hour before she threw it in . I enquired of her , if she had made any Preparation for its being born ? She told me , she had two Caps given her , but she had given them away again . The Child was brought to my House , before they carried it to the Cage ; and I plainly saw its Death was occasioned by the Bruise on the Head , for no Water appeared in it , and it was very fresh when I first saw it . Elizabeth Thackery . When the Prisoner was taken , she was carry 'd to the Sign of the Bell ; I went thither and ask 'd her , if she was the unfortunate poor Creature that had had a Child ? Yes , ( she said ) and it was found drown 'd . I enquired of her , who was the Father of it ? She told me , - John Gadd was the Father , and that she was not marry 'd to him , but she had lived with him in an odd Manner , a Year and a half , and had miscarr'yd of a Child , by him , once before . She said , she was very poor , and was delivered of this Child as she was going over a Style : That it was born alive , and she heard it cry a little , but she had nothing to wrap it in , except a Bit of her old Apron , and she was so very ill , she did not know what to do with herself . She said , John Gadd was a very wicked Fellow , and she did not know but he might make away with it , tho ' she just before had told me , - that she , herself , put it into the Water , and she did not say any thing was done to it , before she put it in . I saw the Bruise on the Side of the Head . The Midwife . 'T is not impossible that Bruise might be given it , by throwing it into the Water . Prisoner . I went to Richmond to see for Work , and when I got there , I fell in Travel , and sat down for two Hours to ease my Pains . While I was there , the Beadle of Richmond came to me ; I asked him for the Help of some good Women . He threatened me , and brought me cross the Water ; then he called me Bitch , and bid me shift for myself . So I went to Twickenham , and there likewise I was refused Relief , and the Beadle of that Place , led me out of that Town , and left me in the Fields ; where I was so bad , that I was almost dead , and did not know whether my Baby was dead or alive . The Midwife . She did say something to me , about the Beadle of Richmond refusing her Help . Samuel Goodwin . The Day the Coroner sat on the Child , the Prisoner told me , that no Person was with her when she was delivered , but this John Gadd , whom I have often seen with her , under my Haycocks . She likewise said , That a Quarter of an Hour after she had been delivered , John Gadd took her Apron from under her Head , and having tore a Piece off , he wrapped the Child in it , and went away , and she never had seen him since . Guilty , Death . 438.

We charged the Prisoner , because he sold a yellow Silk Gown of mine , the very next Day . William Atwater . I saw the Goods carry 'd out of the House , by the Porter , belonging to the Waggon ; his Name is Richard Aldridge . And Mr. Russel is the Owner of the Waggon . William Russel . Mrs. Atwater 's Chest of Drawers was put into the Waggon the 4th of July , and it was taken out a little beyond Turnham Green . We came from Reading on the 4th of July , and the Waggon was robbed the 5th about one o'Clock in the Morning . I was then on Horseback . Three Men on Foot came up to me , and clapped each of them a Pistol to me , and cry 'd , - d-mn you , stop the Waggon , or you are a dead Man , They asked me if I had any Fire-Arms , or any Guard in the Waggon ? I told them , - no , I had not ; and that there was only an old Man in it , who was going to London . The Prisoner I believe was the Man who stood Guard over me while the others robbed the Waggon . I had a little Knowledge of him , for he visited me one Night upon the Road , near the same Place , about One o'Clock , in May last , and robbed the Waggon then , with one Man in his Company . The Moon at that time shone pretty bright , and I could discern something of him , for we had then a pretty deal of Talk together ; and by his Size , his Voice , and Manner of Speaking , I verily believe he is one of the Men that robb 'd me now ; but this last Time it was dark , and I ca n't say I discerned his Face , but I remembered his Size and Voice , and was in Hopes he would have let me gone on , as he had robbed me so lately ; but I was mistaken , for he came up with two others , and presenting their Pistols at me , they bid me stop the Waggon ; I bid them stop it themselves , - I would not , - but they made me do it , and then the Prisoner ( I apprehend ) stood over me , while the other two got up into the Waggon , to see what they could find . They were in the Waggon near a Quarter of an Hour , and threw out a Chest of Drawers , a Portmanteau , a Trunk ; and a Great Coat , with a Shirt in one of the Pockets , which one of them who had been in the Waggon put on ; but on my telling them it was my Coat , the Man who guarded me bid him give it me again . Then they took their Goods upon their Backs , and bid me go about my Business . Richard Stiles . I was in the Waggon , on the 5th of July , when it was stopp 'd near Turnham-Green . They asked Russel , ( who was then driving the Waggon ) whether any Body was in it , and whether he had any Fire-arms ? He told them , no ; and then a tall , brisk , active Man ( such a Man as the Prisoner , by his Size and Voice ) said to his two Companions , - d-mn you , get up into the Waggon . I am pretty sure the Prisoner is the Man . As soon as the two Men had got into the Waggon , they threw out a large Scale-beam , and a Horse 's Harness ; a Chest of Drawers , a Trunk , and a Portmanteau , which was wedged in between some Barrels of Beer . They came in at the Tail of the Waggon , and went out at the Head ; but before they left it , one of them took my Coat which lay by me , with a Shirt in the Pocket , and put it on . I am Russel 's Brother , and he being lame , I came up with him to help him . The Man ( whom I take to be the Prisoner ) talk 'd to him about five Minutes . They were not long in doing what they were about . Mary Elliot . I know the Prisoner . On the 5th of July , between the Hours of Nine and Twelve in the Forenoon , he brought me this Mantelet , and a Velvet Hood , to be pawn 'd . This Gown I had of the Prisoner 's Mother-in-Law , and upon these three Things I lent him 25s . These Goods in this Bundle ( producing another Parcel ) I had likewise from his Mother-in-Law ; her Name is Kitchen . I can not say I had any Discourse with him concerning the Things I had from her , but when they were both before Mr. Deveil , she said ( in his Presence ) she had the Things from him , and he did not deny it . She was taken up , and sent to Newgate , where she since died . Henry Grubb , Pawnbroker . Here is an Apron and a Cap , which Mrs . Kitchen , the Prisoner 's Mother-in-Law , brought to me on the 6th of July , and I lent her Money on them : Soon after I had taken them in , I saw them advertised , and gave Notice to the Prosecutor ; upon which Mrs . Kitchen was taken up , and she confess 'd she had the Goods of the Prisoner : Then we took him , and carry 'd him and his Mother before Mr. Deveil , where she charged him with having given her these Things , and he owned he did so . We asked him about the rest of the Goods , but he said he did not know of any more than were produced . Mrs. Atwater . This Cap and Apron are mine ; 't is a very particular Apron , - I work 'd it with my own Hands . Grubb . Mr. Deveil asked the Prisoner how he came by these Things , and he told him , his Friend gave them to him . Hickman Young . I was at Mr. Deveil 's when he granted a Warrant to apprehend the Prisoner . When we took him , he asked us what our Business was ? We told him we had a Warrant for him , and when we had hand-cuffed him , we shew 'd it to him : At first he deny 'd every thing , and when he was before the Justice , he said he knew nothing of the Robbery ; but when some of the Goods were produced , he owned his Mother had them from him . There was another Cap produced at that Time , which Mrs . Kitchen had sold to one Mrs. Turner Turner . This is the Cap : The Prisoner 's Sister , Elizabeth Kitchen , brought it to me on a Friday Night , and told me the Prisoner 's Wife was dead , and that he was selling off her Cloaths , any of which I might have very reasonable : I did not care to buy the Cap of her , so she brought her Mother and the Prisoner to my Room on Sunday Morning , and then I paid the Mother 7s . and 6 d. for it , and I saw her deliver the Money into the Prisoner 's Hands at the Foot of my Bed . Mrs. Atwater . This is my Cap . Elizabeth Kitchen ( the Prisoner 's Sister ) . And I had it from the Prisoner . John Becket , Constable . I have two Pair of Sleeves in my Custody : I was sent for on the 27th of July to Mr. Grubb 's , where I found Mrs . Kitchen , and was charg 'd with her . We afterwards search 'd her House , and found these Sleeves which Mrs. Atwater own 'd ; Mrs . Kitchen said she had them from her Son , and he did not deny it . Prisoner . I was sick when this Robbery was committed . Pray did I say I gave my Mother those Things ? Becket . Yes : These Things ( the Sleeves ) were found in his Mother 's Drawers , and when we had them before Mr. Deveil , he would had the Mother to have made herself an Evidence . He asked her , before the Prisoner , where she had them , and she said , - her Son made her a Present of them . Joseph Nicholene . I keep a publick House in King street , St. Ann 's . The Prisoner came to lodge at my House on the 2nd of June ; he lodg 'd there seven Weeks , and behaved well ; I never catch 'd any thing upon him He lay abroad two Nights in the Time ; but I do n't know when it was : He was sick when he first came , and had a Wound in the Face , but I do n't know how it was caus 'd : He had a Nurse with him a good while . I once ask 'd him how his Face came to be hurt , and he told me , he had been quarrelling and fighting . - Bold . I nursed the Prisoner , but I know nothing of his Illness : I came the 2d of June , and was with him seven Weeks ; I sat up with him four Nights , and then I used to go home ; I did not stay with him every Night . Prisoner . These Things were brought into Mr. Nicholene 's House , and I gave them to my Mother to dispose of . Bold . I saw his Mother bring some Things into that House , but what they were , I ca n't tell . Guilty , Death . 439.

Mr. Rigg . On the 30th of July , between Eleven and Twelve at Night , I was going along Fenchurch-street , in Company with Mr. West , and the Prisoner met me at the Corner of Lime street , with a Crape over his Face ; he offer 'd a Cobler 's Knife to my Breast , and order 'd me to deliver my Money : I stood a little surprised , and he said again , - Deliver ; then I up with my Stick , and gave him a Blow which made him reel , and called the Watch ; upon which he took to his Heels , and ran up Lime-street . The Watch pursu 'd him , and we followed them , and took him ( about twenty Yards from the Place where he stopp 'd me ) with the Knife in his Hand , and the Crape upon his Face , which he pull 'd off , as soon as the Watchman laid hold of him .

Selwin . I lost my Watch and Seal , worth 3 l. with a King 's Road Ticket ( which hung to the Watch ) o he 19th of August last . The Watch was in my Fob , and I lost it in Oxendon-street , about Twelve o'Clock at Night : I was in a private House there with the Prisoner ; she carry 'd me there about Twelve o'Clock , and there was another Woman in Company , but she was not near me . I did not stay long in the House , - 't was not above ten Minutes , or a Quarter of an Hour , and indeed I did not miss my Watch till next Morning . How I came to go to this private House with them , at that Time o'Night , - I ca n't tell . - They asked me to give them a Dram ; and I was in Liquor . I miss 'd my Watch next Morning ; and hearing the Prisoner had it , I got a Warrant , and took her up : While we were carrying her along , she desired I would go back with her , and accordingly I did , and she return 'd me the Watch , the Seal , and the King 's Road Ticket ; but she said it was not she who took it from me , she told me the other Woman took it , and gave it to her . Prisoner . Pray did not the other Woman - sit upon your Knee ? Selwin . No , she did not ; but the Prisoner did . I had both Gold and Silver in my Pocket at the same Time , to the Amount of 3 or 4 l. but they did not meddle with that . Prisoner . When he and I went into this House , we went up Stairs together ; and the other Woman was jealous , because he took more Notice of me , than he did of her , and so she went to him , and sat upon his Knee . Ann Wilford . I have known the Prisoner about a Year and a half , or two Years . Her Character ! - as to that , - I ca n't talk about that : But the Man did come in with the Women , and the Prisoner was one of them ; I serv 'd them with Liquor ; they had five Half-pints of Wine , and after the last Half-pint was serv 'd them , my Maid came down , and asked me , if I would take the Gentleman 's Watch in Pawn for a Guinea ? Money was short with me , and I told her I would not . The Maid that serv 'd them with Liquor , was not the other Person - who sat upon his Knee , and that 's all I know of the Matter . Esther Buckley . No , I was the Servant in the House , - at that Time . They had five Half-pints of Wine , and when the Reckoning came to be paid , the Gentleman gave me - but half a Crown , and a Piece of Paper , and told me he had no more Money ; then he pull 'd out his Watch , and desired me to go down to my Mistress and get a Guinea upon it : My Mistress would not lend the Money , so I carried it up to him again , and I saw him give it to the other Woman who was then with him - not to the Prisoner . Indeed he was very much in Liquor . Ann Lucas . The Prosecutor lost his Watch on Sunday Night ; and on Monday Night as I was out - looking for my Husband , the Prosecutor laid hold of me in Oxendon-street ; I told him I did not know him really ; come , come ( says he ) is signifies nothing for you to deny it , - You have got my Watch , and if you wo n't go with me , I will swear a Robbery against you ; I ask 'd him where he lost it ? He told me , - at such a House . I went with him thither , and the People knew nothing of me . Upon this he treated me with a Pot of Beet , asked my Pardon , - and so we parted . James Burnet . On Tuesday Night , after the Man had lost his Watch , I was drinking at the Butchers Arms , the Corner of Lombard-Court , and there I saw the Prisoner in Custody of a Constable . In a little time they went out , and came in again in half an Hour ; and then the Gentleman told the Constable , he must discharge the Prisoner , for he had nothing to say against her : The Constable said , he could not do it , without carrying her before a Justice ; no Justice was to be found , so the Constable would have carry 'd her to the Round-house ; but the Landlord said , the Prisoner was a Gentlewoman of - such Honour , - that she would to be sure come again in the Morning ; so the Constable took her Word , and she accordingly came . Ellen Dod . The Prisoner is a Mantua-maker ; she work 'd for me and my Mistress two Years : I know her to be a very hard-working Woman . Martha Miller . She worked a Year and a half with me , and behaved well . s Thomas Kelly . I have known her five or six Years . She has worked for my Wife these two Years , and behaved true and honest .

The Council for the Prosecution having open 'd the Charge and the Nature of the Offence , the Witnesses were called . George Fisher . I am Clerk of Alhallows London Wall , and this is the Register Book of that Parish . Counc . See if you find the Entry of Fowke 's Marriage in 1712 . Fisher . Here it is . Clerk reads . '' Marriages . ( The Title at the Top ) Thomas `` Fowke and Sarah Parsley , Aug the 31st , 1712 . Counc . How long have you been Clerk ? Fisher . About five Years . Counc . Is the Person living , who was Minister in 1712 . Fisher . No . The Minister , Clerk , and Sexton , are all dead : But this is the Book in which the Entries were then made ; 't is the Register Book of our Parish . I came in , on the Death of my Predecessor : His Name was Samuel Wallington , and he had been Clerk twenty-seven Years . The Minister keeps it in his Possession , and I fetched it from his House Yesterday . Elizabeth Wilson . I know the Prisoner : He 's my Son in-Law , by marrying my Daughter-in-Law ; her Name was Sarah Parsley . I have known the Prisoner , - but twenty-seven Years the 1st Day of last August . Counc . Was you at the Wedding ? Wilson . No ; I staid at Home to dress the Wedding Dinner : But a Kinswoman of my Husband 's , was at the Wedding , and one John North gave her away . They all went out together , and at Night I bedded them . I remember it all very well . Why they lived together in my House a Fortnight , before they took a House for themselves . The Prisoner had two Children by her : They are both now alive , and the eldest is in her 26th Year ; that was a Daughter , and the Son is , - ( stay , I would not tell a Lye ) the Son is in his 25th Year . They lived together a great while in Bishopsgate Parish . Counc . Is Sarah Parsley living or dead . Wilson . She died three Quarters of a Year after he marry 'd this second Wife . The Books are here to shew it . Counc . When did she die ? Wilson . She has been dead about three Years , I believe . I can not remember the Year , - I would not tell a Lie , if you 'd give me all the World . Counc . After they had taken a House for themselves , how long did they live together ? Wilson . About six Years ; and he all the time acknowledged her for his Wife . Counc . You say you remember their going out to be married on the 31st of August . Wilson . Yes , very well : It was on a Sunday Morning , twenty-seven Years ago . I might very well remember it , for I was married to her Father five Years before , at the same Church , by Dr. Richardson . Counc . You say they lived together five or six Years afterward . Wilson . Between six and seven they lived together , and then Tom . Fowke ( the Prisoner ) left her , and she was forced to go to the Parish where he served his time , for Relief of her and her two Children . When she was sick , I saw her , and she died with Grief . Counc . When was the last Time you saw her alive ? Wilson . I believe it was two Years before she died , less than two Years , but I heard from her within that time . 'T is now about 5 Years since I saw her , - within five Years , I am sure of it , - but I am old and do n't remember particular Days . He cohabited with her sometime after the Marriage at my House , and they lived together six or seven Years I dressed the Wedding Dinner , tho ' I did not go to the Wedding . We were not young Folks , nor so flashy as to want to go to Weddings . Counc . You say he lived with her six or seven Years ? Wilson . Yes : And after that he left her , and liv 'd upon the Strole , and lov 'd to gad about , as Men do too much that have the Breeches , and she was forced to put herself and Children on the Parish , while he lived where he pleased , as most Men like to do . Robert Crane . I know the Prisoner ; I knew his Wife , Sarah Parsley , before she was marry 'd to him : And I knew her after she was marry 'd , six or seven Years . I saw her alive , the 24th of April , 1736 , at the House of one Raddish , at the Sign of Hackney Town , in Bishopsgate-street . She had lived there about fourteen or fifteen Years . I am sure she was alive then , for I drank a Pint of Ale there , and saw her , but when she died I ca n't tell . Counc . Was you at the Wedding ? Crane . No ; but I remember their living together after they were marry 'd , and he and I worked together after that . John North , who gave her away , is my First-Cousen , and I was a Relation of Sarah Parsley 's , at a vast Distance . After the Prisoner left her , she made her Application to this Raddish , who was Clerk to a Brewer , and kept an Alehouse , and he took her to be his 24th of April 1736 , because I was then at work , at Joiners Hall , and having 15c.wt . and one Quarter of Lead to carry , I went there to hasten the Carman , and this appears by my Books . James Stanley . I am Clerk of Butalph Bishopsgate , this is the Register-book of that Parish . Counc . See for the Burials in September 1736 . Stanley . Here is the Entry of Sarah Fowke 's Burial . Clerk reads . '' Burials ; September 1736 , Sarah `` Fowke , the 9th . Aged 47 . ' Ann Fowke . I know the Prisoner to my Sorrow . I was married to him the 10th of October 1735 . We were married at St. Andrews Wardrobe , and Mr. Wright , the Coroner , gave me away . He was the Father , and persuaded me to have him . I knew the Prisoner about three Years before I was married to him , but not for any Harm . I was a Widdow , and of the same Name with the Prisoner , but not related to him . Prisoner . Did not you know me longer than three Years ? Did not you know me seven or eight Years before Marriage ? Mrs. Fowke . I ca n't justly say : He lived in the Neighbourhood , but I belive not seven or eight Years . Prisoner . How long did you live with me before Marriage ? Mrs. Fowke . Not at all . I did not live with you in any Dishonesty . Prisoner . She was my Housekeeper , in St. Margaret 's , Westminster , three Years . Mrs. Fowke . He never was able to keep a Table in his Life . John Hinton . I am Register-Clerk of St. Andrew Wardrobe , and this is the Register-Book of Marriages . Clerk reads . '' Married in St. Andrew 's Ward-robe `` and St. Ann 's Black Fryars , Anno Domini `` 1735 , October 10th , Thomas Fowke , `` Widower , of St. Margaret 's Westminster , `` and Ann Fowke , Widow , of the same `` Place : By William Grainger . '' I was present at this Marriage , but 't is impossible for me to remember Faces . I have often seen the Woman , because I have been called upon other Trials . Robert Wright , and Jane Wright , were called out , to give Evidence for the King against Thomas Fowke ; but they did not appear . The Council for the Prisoner , as a Point of Law , took Notice of the long Separation there had been between the Prisoner and his first Wife . That it might be presumed , after so long an Absence , he might not know she was living and that there was a Proviso in the Statute , which restrained it from extending to any Person whose Husband or Wife should continually remain for the Space of Seven Years beyond the Seas ; or whose Husband or Wife should absent himself or herself for Seven Years , within any Part of his Majesty 's Dominions , the one from the other ; and the Party so left , not knowing the other to be alive : And as there had been no Proof given of the Defendant 's knowing his first Wife was alive , they hoped he was not within the Statute . Prisoner . As to her Separation , there 's Raddish to call ; I do n't know his Christian Name : but he 's the Person she lived with . Raddish appeared ; but the Prisoner would not have him sworn for him : Upon which he was called by the Council for the Prosecution , and sworn . John Raddish . I knew Sarah Parsley : she lived with me sixteen or seventeen Years , or upwards . She died the 6th of September 1736 , and was , ( I think ) buried on the 9th . Council . Do you know the Prisoner ? Raddish . No ; but I have seen him at my House several times before the Death of the Woman , and he has seen her often at my House . Council . Have you seen him at your House , within nine or 10 Years last past ? Raddish . I have seen him who they said was her Husband ; but I never spake three Words to him in my Life ; - I do n't know him ; I never saw him to take Notice of him ; but I have seen him , and when he has been gone , People have told me , That Man was Sarah Parsley 's Husband . He has been often at our House . The Witness being old , and his Sight weak , he was ordered to go to the Bar , and look at the Prisoner . Council . Now you have seen him , do you know him ? Have you ever seen him before ? Raddish . Yes : I reckon he is the Man ; I have seen him at my House ; but I can not justly tell how long before her Death : I believe it might be a Year . This was the last Time I saw him , and before he went out of the House , I sat down by him , and when he was gone , the People told me he was Sarah Parsley 's Husband . Counc . Did he then see Sarah Parsley ? Raddish . I do n't know whether she was dead or alive then . Counc . Just now you said it was before her Death . Raddish . I ca n't well tell when it was . Counc . At the time this Man was in your House , did she come into the Room to you ? Raddish . She did not then ; there was only he and I in the Room : I do n't know where she was at that time : She commonly went out of the House when he came in , and staid till he was gone . Counc . Did he ever come but that Time ? Raddish . As they told me , he had been there a great many times ; but I never saw him to know him but that time : and then I sat down with him , and talk 'd with him , about its being fine Weather - a fine Season ; but I was not with him Half a Quarter of an Hour . When he went out , the Neighbours asked me if I knew who that Man was ? I said no ; they told me it was Sarah Fowkes 's Husband : And I am sure she was then alive . Counc . And how long is this ago ? Raddish . About four or five Years ago . The Prisoner is the Man ; I believe he is the Man . Mr. Crane . About ten Years ago , the Prisoner and I went into Raddish 's House , and had a Pot of Beer ; but I did not see his Wife . He reported that she lived with Raddish , and was his Whore ; this was about eight or nine Years ago ; he often said , she was a Whore and a Bitch , and lived with old Raddish , and tuck 'd him up , and lay with him . This he often said , between eight and nine Years ago . I am positive it was within nine Years , and that within that Time I have asked him , When he saw his Wife ? And he has said , - D-mn her , I have not seen her , - so long . We often talked about her ; I have had some Conversation with him since that Time ; but his Wife was not mentioned , except once , and that was about three Months ago ; I then saw him in the Tipstaff 's House , and ask 'd him , how he could be so base , to marry another Woman , when his first Wife was alive ? D-mn it , ( said he ) what 's that to you ? Counc . How long ago is it since you had any Conversation with him about his Wife , in her Life-Time ? Crane . I ca n't be positive to half a Year . 'T is nine Years ago , or thereabout . Counc . Are you sure it was within ten Years , or eleven Years ? Crane . No . Council to Raddish . Did not she die at your House ? Raddish . Yes . William Merriman . I knew Sarah Fowke : She lived next Door to me . She died in September , and I buried her the 9th , 1736 . I know nothing of the Prisoner . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty .

William Pemberton . I keep a Publick House , the Coach and Horses in Conduit-street . On the 20th of August , about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon , I lay down on a Bed in a Closet behind the Room where the Accident happened . About Six , some Carpenters , who were at Work in the Yard , making a Noise , I 'wak 'd , and heard the Word - Bitch , in the little Room . 'T was a small Drinking-Room on the Ground-Floor , and parted off from the Room where I lay by a Single-deal Partition , pannell 'd . I imagin 'd somebody was abusing my Wife , so I got up ; and as I was coming through this little Room , I saw the Prisoner with his Left Arm round the Deceased 's Neck , and his Right Hand somewhere on her Breast . Lord , Sir , said I , what 's the Matter ! His Answer was , - The Gentlewoman is in a Fit ! In a Fit , said I ! I am afraid 't is something worse ; how came her Mouth to be so bloody ? For the Blood ran from her Mouth down her Stays and her Apron , and she was sitting in a Chair , with her Head lolling back over his Arm : I called three times for Water , and the fourth time it was brought : I sprinkled some in her Face , and endeavoured to make her drink some ; but she was gone . While I was doing this , the Prisoner escaped out of the Room , and left some new Linnen behind him , and a little Child of the Deceased followed him , crying . Some small Time after this , another Child of the Deceased came to our House , and said , Lord , Sir ! I hear my Mother is killed , pray let me see her . I told him his Mother was better , and asked him where his Mother used to buy Linnen ? He told me - at the Corner of Carnaby Market . I took the Child and the Linnen to the Place , and the Man knew it , and said it was bought of him about Four o'Clock that Evening . The Boy then told us the Prisoner 's Name was Watts , and that he used to meet his Mother at one Carter 's , the Red Cross in May-Fair . We went thither , and Carter said the Prisoner had not been there for three or four Days ; he believed we might find him at Kensington , where he was Usher in a School . At Kensington we enquired after him a good while to no Purpose ; but at last , one who was with us having some Acquaintance with Carter 's Son , ( who was Coachman to Madam Jacob at Kensington ) he put us upon going to the Stables where the Coachman lay . When we came there , we ask 'd if Mr. Watts was not there ? and , to prevent Suspicion , I shamm 'd drunk , and said , I would drink no more . Carter 's Son spoke to us out of a Window , and asked us what we wanted with him ? We told him we wanted to speak with him : Upon which he [ Carter ] came down and open 'd the Door : Then we got in , and upon searching the Hay-loft , I observed some Straw to stand up against the Wall ; I put it aside with my Stick , and found the Prisoner behind it . We searched him , and found nothing upon him but his Penknife . His Ruffles and his Right Hand were bloody , and he had the same Shirt on when we carry 'd him before the Justice . Prisoner 's Q . Was the Door of the Room in which you was asleep lock 'd , or unlock 'd ? Pemberton . There is a Lock to it ; but whether it was lock 'd or no , I ca n't tell . 'T was not lock 'd when I came out . Prisoner . Is there not a Window in the Room where this happen 'd , which looks into the Yard where the Carpenters were at Work ? Pemberton . Yes ; and there is a Glass Door , with a Curtain before it , which looks into the Common Drinking Room . Prisoner . Did not I call for Water , and desire Assistance ? Pemberton . Not , as I remember . Prisoner . Was not you in Liquor at that Time ? Pemberton . I was as sober then , as I am now . Lochlan Maclaughlan deposed , that he was going by the Door about Six that Evening , and hearing a Woman was dying in the House , he went in , and found her siting in a Chair : Mr. Pemberton was washing the Blood from her Mouth . Her Pulse was gone : But she being warm , he open 'd a Vein , and she bled about a Spoonful or two . He said there was the Mark of a Blow , or Fall , upon her Left Jaw ; that she had bleed much at her Mouth , and that he saw no other Marks of Violence upon her . William Graves gave an Account , that he was sitting that Evening at Pemberton 's Door , and the Prisoner came out of the House and asked him to direct him to Mr. Despagnol 's House , the Surgeon ; which he did ; and the Prisoner ran down the Street , towards the House . That immediately afterward , he heard a Woman was dead in the House ; upon which he went in , and found her sitting in a Chair , bleeding at the Mouth , and her Head lolling on one Side . That he thought proper to wipe the blood out of her Mouth , and finding her dead , he went to Mr. Despagnol 's , to enquire if any body had been to fetch him to a Woman at this House , and was informed , that no one had been there for above an Hour past , upon which he told them , the Woman had not been dead above half an Hour . He added , That he saw the Prisoner the Day after he was taken , and was positive he was the Man that he directed to Mr. Despagnol 's . That he had sat at the Door about half an Hour , before the Prisoner came out ; that the Place where he sat , was about the Breadth of the Court from the Room in which the Woman died , and that the Prisoner came out at the Back-door . John Jones deposed , That the Prisoner came to him last Monday was a Fortnight , and told him , that he had appointed Mrs. Redman to meet him at The Coach and Horses about buying some Cloth ; that he went to her there , and Words arising about the Liquor , and the Price for making the Shirts , she told him she would sooner go a-digging , than work for such a Scrub-dog as he . That he told her he was no more a Dog , than she was a Bitch ; upon which she told him , she would split his Brains out , and snatching up an Apple , in throwing it at him , she fell down . That upon lifting her up , she bled at the Mouth , and the Landlord coming in , while he was wiping off the blood , he called for Water , and desired him three Times to get a Surgeon , which the Landlord not doing , he went to Mr. Despagnol 's himself ; but he not being at home , nor any Surgeon to be found , at two or three other Places where he went for one , he returned to Pemberton 's Door , and hearing the Woman was dead , he was struck with such a Terror , that he could not go in , but came directly to this Witness , and gave him this Account , desiring his Advice , what to do . The Witness said , he advised him to keep out of the Way 'till the Sessions began , and then to surrender himself and take his Trial . He gave the Prisoner the Character of a very quiet , peaceable Man , and not at all given to Quarrelling . Thomas Carter deposed , That the Prisoner came to him that Night , about Seven in the Evening , and told him much the same Story ; that he advised the Prisoner to surrender , but he being unwilling to do so , because he had no Money to keep him in Goal , the Witness consented to let him stay with him , and John Jones was to bring him Word next Morning , whether the Woman was dead or not . This Witness confirmed the Account given by Mr. Pemberton , of the Prisoner 's being taken behind the Straw in the Hayloft . Richard Twist deposed , That he was a Carpenter , and had some Men at Work in Pemberton 's Yard when this Accident happened . That at Six o'Clock that Evening he was drinking with two or three Friends in the publick Room , which is parted from that , in which the Prisoner and the Deceased then were , but by a slight Partition . That he heard no Noise , 'till Pemberton came to the Door and called for Water ; and about six Minutes after this , he went into the Room , and found the Deceased and the Prisoner in the Condition and Situation related by the former Witnesses , and Mr. Pemberton was endeavouring to give her some Water . That she had lost all Motion , when he came into the Room , and the Prisoner told him she had fell down against a Chair , and had hurt herself ; that upon his saying she was dead , the Prisoner then went for a Surgeon , and did not attempt to go before . This Witness gave an Account of her Child 's coming to enquire for his Mother , by which Means they came to the Knowledge of the Prisoner , and he believed if there had been any extraordinary Noise made he should have heard it , - but he heard none . Peter Maccullogh , the Surgeon , deposed , That he viewed the Body of the deceased two Days after her Death . That it was then so corrupted , he could not perceive any Marks of Violence upon it , only that the lower Jaw-bone was broke , and upon opening the Head and Breast , he found a great Quantity of extravasated Blood in the Cavities of the Brain and Stomach , which might be occasioned ( he thought ) by a violent Blow , or a sudden Fall , which shook the Brain , and made the Blood Vessels start . The Prisoner 's Examination before Sir Edward Hill , was produced , and ( being proved ) was read . It contain 'd the Account the Prisoner gave to Sir Edward , of the Accident , and was agreeable to that given by the Prisoner to the former Witnesses . Samuel Brown , a Chairman , depos 'd , That the Prisoner enquired of him in Bond-street for any Surgeon ; he directed him to Mr. Ranby , but did not see whether he went to the House or not . And William Allen his Partner confirm 'd his Evidence . James Gulliford , a Carpenter , was at Work in the Yard ; and something after Six he came into the House to put up his Tools , and he heard no Noise nor Disturbance while he was in or about the House . Mrs. Cox , ( Wife of the Gentleman at Kensington to whom the Prisoner was Usher ) Mr. Wiseman Holt , ( a Clergyman ) John Kelly , Thomas Woodward , and Edward Bland , gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest , good-natur 'd , grave , peaceable Man . Acquitted . 467 William Davis was indicted for privately stealing a Muslin Handkerchief , val . 12 d. from the Person of Joshua Murphey , Aug. 12 . Guilty , 10 d. [ Transportation .

On the 29th of July I met the Prisoner in Well Court , between Charterhouse-Lane and Long-Lane , and she ask 'd me to make her drink ; so she pick't me up , and carry 'd me to a House , and we went up Stairs : I staid an Hour with her , drinking Gin , and when I came down Stairs , I found she had pick 'd my Pocket of my Watch . She was a Stranger to me , but yet I would go and drink with her , and I had my Watch when I went into the House with her , for I look 'd to see what it was a Clock , when I was about 3 or 400 Yards from the Door . While we were above Stairs together , we only sat talking together , - she on one Chair , and I on another , we and after we had talk 'd and drank together , we came down Stairs , and in the Entry she pick 'd the Watch out of my Fob ; - 't was not in the Room , - 't was in the Entry , and I felt her Hand in the Pocket when she took it out : As soon as she had pull 'd it away from me , she ran into another House : I did not cry , Stop Thief , but I ran after her , and could not overtake her before she got into the House ; and when I enquired for her at that House , the People told me there was no such Woman there . About 10 Days afterward I took her , and she was carry 'd before the Lord Mayor , who committed her to Newgate ; when she was before him , she deny 'd the Fact . Prisoner . He says he was in a Room with me , up one Pair of Stairs , - 't is a Ground room of mine , where I have liv 'd these two Years : He was above Stairs indeed , in a Room next Door to me , where there is only two Stools , and a Chair . He put another Woman in the Warrant with me , and he keeps her out of the Way , and prosecutes me , because my Name 's Allen , and I threw a Pot of Water in his Face . Esther Rawlins . The Day the Prisoner was carried to my Lord Mayor 's , they had no hearing , so they went to Guild-hall to have a Hearing there , and they call 'd in at an Alehouse by Guildhall : One Moll Gunn was with us , who had ( caused ) this Bess Allen ( to be ) taken up ; and Moll Gunn said to the Prosecutor , - if he did not swear directly that this Bess Allen had the Watch , Bess would do her a Mischief ; upon which he said he would swear it downright , because she should not hurt her . In the next Place there is Bess Barnes , who says this Gentleman was robb 'd in her Entry , by Betty Allen , - by the same Token he said he would swear downright to her . Prisoner . He promised to fetch Moll Gunn 's Gown out of Pawn ; he treated her with a Dinner every Day at the Cat Alehouse in Charterhouse-Lane , to keep out of the Way . Summer . This Woman ( Rawlins ) was the very Person that impeach 'd the Prisoner . Rawlins . The last Time the Prosecutor gave Gunn a Dinner , she was angry that I came to take a Bit with them , and he would not let me . Summer . I did not hinder you . Rawlins . She ( Moll Gunn ) said she could do his Business for him , in swearing against this Woman , and now she 's run away . Summer . This Woman came after me to the Cat , and said she could swear it upon her ; she was the Person who pawn 'd the Watch . Acquitted . 470.

Richard Summer . On the 29th of July , as I was coming along the Devil's-Nook , - 't is an Alley in Long-Lane , I met with Richard Goodyere , so he and I went to drink together at the Green Dragon in Long-Lane : I had a Horse to dispose of , and he was to help me to a Chap who was to buy him , but they wanted me to take their Note for the Money . After we had talked a while about the House they told me they could help me to the Watch I had lost * , and if I would > give him a Guinea , they would get it directly : Upon this Account I went to Goodyere 's House , between Seven and Eight o'Clock in the Evening , and there was the Prisoner and two other Women . We fell to drinking Gin , and after we had drank a while , Richard Goodyere began be quarrelsome , and said he believed I had not Money to pay the Reckoning , I pull 'd out my Bag , to shew them that I had Money , and the Prisoner snatch 'd it out of my Hand , and Richard flung me down , and I fell with my Head against a Chair , the Blow stunn 'd me for some Time , and I got up as soon as I could , - but every Soul of them were ran away , there was no one left in the House but myself : They all ran over into the Marshalsea , where they had a Friend who took them in , and it was a Week before I could take them ; there were three of them concerned , but I took only the two Goodyeres , and carry 'd them before the Lord Mayor , where she said nothing at all , and he confess 'd he had my Gold . * See the preceeding Trial of Elizabeth Allen . Prisoner . Ask him if he has not been robb 'd , since ? A Gentleman . He has been simple enough to be robb 'd of 70 l. since this . Prisoner .

I saw her ( I believe ) once before , in Smithfield ; she is a remarkable Woman , and is a little humpback 'd . Prisoner . Ask him if he did not ask my Husband to give him some of the Money again , and if he did not tell him he had none of it ? Summer .

He was a 2d Time charged , by vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest , for feloniously slaying the said Price . It appear 'd from the Evidence , that Thorn kept a Chandler 's Shop , and the Deceased meeting with the Prisoner there , the Deceased call 'd the Prisoner Black-guard Rogue and Rascal , and told him he was a Bailiff 's Follower , and they were worse than Dogs ; that the Prisoner call 'd him Blockhead , and bid him be quiet , but the Deceased ( being a little in Liquor ) went up to him , threw his Hat in the Prisoner 's Face , and tore his Coat ; upon which the Prisoner , as he sat upon a little Table , gave the Deceased a little Kick on the Backside , and bid him be gone ; but he ( the Deceased ) turn 'd , and gave the Prisoner a Blow in the Face , and then they laid hold of each other , and fell to the Ground together .

I was coming along , and saw 'Squire Poyntz 's Servant with her , but he ran away and left her ; so she and I went to this uninhabited Place together . I am sure I had it when I first went thither , for I pull 'd it out to tell the Fellow that ran from her what it was a Clock ; but then this uninhabited Place is a Quarter of a Mile from the Place where I pull 'd it out . We staid in this uninhabited Place together till Four o'Clock in the Morning ; I miss 'd it indeed half an Hour after I got there ; and I told her I had lost it , but she knew nothing of the Matter . At last I heard it click in her Bosom , and then I struck her , and she cry 'd out Murder ; yet still she deny 'd it , and so the Prisoner and I came together about Four o'Clock into the Town , and meeting with an Hostler that formerly belong 'd to the Duke of Ormond , I told him of my Loss , and we all three went back to this uninhabited Place to look for my Watch , but 't was not to be found ; we hunted about in the Stable , ( where we had been together ) but we could not find it . She deny 'd it all this time , and while I was talking to the Hostler , she ran away ; but she was taken on Sunday Night following , and I went to her at a publick House at Kensington ; there I heard the Watch was pawn 'd at the Three Bowls , in Old Soho , and at that Place I found it . When I came out of the Justice 's House with her , I asked her - how she could be so cross , as not to give me my Watch ?
