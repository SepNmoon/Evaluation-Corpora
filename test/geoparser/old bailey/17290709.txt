He reply 'd , She was Singing and merry as she was doing her Business . Thomas Saunders depos 'd , That having come from the South-Sea House , be call 'd at Mr . Pain 's , and did there dine , as had been before depos 'd ; that the Prisoner being in the Box , ( he suppos 'd at Dinner ) came out of the Box , and a Neighbour having sent for some Drink , he carried it out , and two Country Men coming in in the mean time , the Deceas 'd went down for two Pints of Drink , one for them , and the other for herself , and that he saw no Knife in her Hand ; that upon Mrs . Pain 's calling to Mr . Pain , he went , and found the Deceas 'd lying , as before-mentioned , and the Prisoner having one Hand under her Arm , and he believ 'd she was at that time Stone Dead ; that the Prisoner being ask 'd how it happen 'd , said he knew not ; that when he came into the Room the Deceas 'd was leaning her Head upon the Table , and said , James , I am a dead Woman ; and that he asking her how it came , she fell down on the Ground . This Evidence being ask 'd how long it was from the Time of the Prisoner 's going into the Room , and his calling Mrs . Pain ? He answer 'd , It was about 3 or 4 Minutes ; he added , that there was a Print over her Left Ear . Being ask 'd if he heard any Noise while the Prisoner was in the Room ? he reply 'd , No , and he was so near that had there been any made , he must have heard it . Mr.Cox depos 'd , That about two a-Clock that Day , he ran immediately , and found the Deceas 'd lying upon her Back , her Head supported by the Prisoner , and a vast Effution of Blood under her , and he thought he did perceive her Lips to change a little when he came ; but where was no other Appearance of Life ; that turning up her Coats , he found the Wound in the upper Part of her Thigh ; that looking on the Table he found a Knife lying among the other Knives , having a little Blood on the Point ; that the Knife lay with the Handle to the Chimney , about 4 Foot from where the Deceas 'd was : He being ask 'd if the Deceas 'd , supposing she had given herself the Wound , could not afterwards having laid or toss 'd the Knife there in the Manner it was laid ? He reply 'd , He thought not , without a Miracle ; that he afterwards examin 'd the Wound , comparing it with the Knife , and found it had gone 5 Inches into the Thigh ; that it had gone obliquely upwards , and had open 'd or divided the Femoral Artery : Being ask 'd as to the Wound ? he answer 'd , That the Wound was such , that no Person after such a Wound could live more than a Minute and a half , or two Minutes ; that he compar 'd the Knife with the Cuts in the Deceas'd 's Cloaths , and it answer 'd to them exactly ; that the Wound must needs be given with a very great Force , the Knife being a broad round-pointed Knife , and having gone through an Apron , a thick quilted Coat , a Stuff Petticoat , and a coarse strong Shift , and was of Opinion it was not possible that the Deceas 'd could give it to herself : Being ask 'd as to what other Marks of Violence he had taken Notice of ? he reply 'd , That he did observe some Marks about her Chin and Left Ear , as if made by the Compression of the Thumb and Fingers , that appear 'd livid ; that her Left Ear was all contused ; that he did believe he must have confin 'd the Deceas 'd with his left Hand , and given the Wound with his Right . The Cloaths and Knife were produc 'd in Court . Mr. Dennis depos 'd to the same Effect with the former Evidence and that the Nature of the Wound was such , that no Animal could live above 2 Minute and a half after that Artery had been open 'd or divided ; that he had try 'd the Experiment on a Dog , and he dy 'd in a Minute and a quarter ; that it was impossible the Deceas 'd could have given herself the Wound in the Cellar , because afterwards she could not move so much as one Step ; that he also saw the Marks of Violence before mention 'd , which he suppos 'd to be done by a Hand ; and that had there not been a Compression by Violence , the Blood could not have there stagnated ; because such a Wound being receiv 'd , the Blood flows with so great Impetuosity ; and he was of Opinion the Deceas 'd could not possibly lay the Knife where , and as it was , found lying , because a Person having receiv 'd such a Wound , falls immediately into Convulsions , and grows insensible . Mr. Baldwin depos 'd , That being at Mr . Pain 's about 9 a-Clock in the Forenoon , he was eating Roll and Cheese in the Kitchin , and some Discourse passing amongst them , the Prisoner said of the Deceas 'd , She knows what 's what ; to which the Deceas 'd answer 'd , I never had a Bastard , and went up-stairs ; that coming down soon after , she wanted Tea and Sugar for her Mistress , and Mr . Pain being out of Doors , and Deceas 'd said , He was always out when most wanted ; that the Prisoner being puddling with the Poker , struck her on the Backside with it , and said , You Sawcy Slut must my Master give you an Account ; and that he thought he look 'd maliciously ; and that thereupon the Deceas 'd push 'd him on the Shoulder , saying , What did you strike me for ? and that he thought him an ill-natur 'd Fellow . Ann Duncarton , Mrs. Groves , and the Deceased 's Mother , who gave Evidence upon the former Trial , as to the Prisoner having several times us 'd the Deceas 'd ill , did not now give their Evidence , tho ' in Court ready to do it , The Prisoner call 'd some Persons who us 'd the House , to his civil Behaviour towards the Deceas 'd . The Prisoner 's Counsel pleaded strenuously on Behalf of the Prisoner , remarking on the Testimony of the Appellant 's Witness whatsoever they thought might make to the Advantage of the Appellee ; not withstanding which , the Jury upon a mature Deliberation of the Matter , found the Prisoner guilty of the Murther ; whereupon the Appellant came into Court at the Time when Sentence was to be pass 'd on the other Convicts , and demanded Judgment on the Appellee , which was accordingly pronounced upon him .

The Prisoner pleaded , the Prosecutor met her , was very rude , and would have lain with her , and because she would not , he threatned to swear a Robbery against her . There not being sufficient Evidence that she took the Money , the Jury acquitted her . William Page and James Gibbs , of St. James 's Clerkenwell , was indicted for stealing Iron , the goods of John Smither , the 21st of May .
