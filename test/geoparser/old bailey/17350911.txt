On Saturday Night between twelve and one , as I was going home to my Wife and Family , I met the Prisoner Nell Byrom and another Woman : They said I should give them a Tankard of Ale ; I told them it was too late ; No , says Nell , I know a House that is open all night , and so they took me to the Three Daggers Ale-house in Fore-street , where we found the other Prisoner Freeman , and several more . He sat down with us and we drank together till six in the Morning ; and then says Freeman to me , We will have a Funny Wedding , You shall be married to Nell . No , says I , You know that she has got a Husband now in Newgate lying for Transportation : And I have got a Wife and two Children , and my Wife is half gone with another . Then we agreed to take Coach and go to Hornsey , and Nell and I and Freeman and one Allington got in ; but Freeman bid the Coachman drive to the Two Sawyers and Hand-and-pen in Fleet-lane . I asked him what he meant by that ; Why , says he , It signifies nothing talking , We will have a Funny Wedding . To make short of my Story , I was carried to that Ale-house in the Fleet , and we had hardly been there a Quarter of an Hour before she shewed me this Mourning Ring , and asked me if I knew it : Yes , says I , 'T is mine , How came you by it ? By G - , says she , It has tyed us so fast we shall not be easily untied - She gave me the Ring again , and then we took Coach to go back to the Three Daggers . While we were in the Coach she began to be very rustical , and Freeman held up my Hand while she took the Ring off my Finger . Court . And is this what you call a Robbery on the Highway ? Freeman , Have you any Body to your Character ? Freeman . Several , my Lord . Court . Call one or two . Mr. Bell . I have known him twenty Years , I have trusted him with many score Pounds , but never knew any harm of him . He is a Watchmaker . Second Indictment . Joshua Travers . When we came back to the Three Daggers Alehouse I laid my self on a Box to sleep , and while I was dozing , Nell Byrom snatched the Watch out of my Pocket ; I asked her what she meant by that ; Why , says she , This is mine as well as the Ring ; but I will give it you again if you will go with me to see my Husband in Newgate . So in hopes of getting my Watch , I went with her ; but when we came there , her Husband Will Byrom was in bed , and she said to him , Billy , I am married to this Man , but not for Love or Goodwill , but only to get what I can from him and bring it to you ; and here is his Watch ; it will serve you to see what 's a-Clock in Newgate ; but if he wants to know how the time goes , he can look at the Clocks in the Street . So she gave him the Watch . I desired him to return it to me , but he said he knew better , for he should have occasion for it himself . Eleanor Byrom . The Prosecutor courted me seven Years ago , and meeting me that Sunday Morning , he asked me to drink ; We went to the Three Daggers and staid till six in the Morning , and then he asked me to go and be married . I told him I did not much care if I did ; so we went to the Fleet and were married , and here is the Doctor to prove it . Wyat . Between seven and eight on Sunday Morning , I married this Couple . Court . Was not the Man drunk ? Wyat . He was neither drunk nor sober , but they brought two sober Men with them . Court . Sober ! They had been drinking all Night - Did you perform the whole Ceremony according to the Rites of the Church of England ? Wyat . I can not say that I repeated all of it . Court . What do you mean ? Wyat . I did not give them St. Paul 's Advice , but left them to take it or let it alone as they might think proper . I always omit that , and I know it is omitted in several Churches . Court . Was the Man capable of knowing what he was doing ? Wyat . Yes ; for he gave half a Guinea to change ; I returned him a Crown , and he insisted upon having the odd Six pence . And next Day he came to me in a Coach for a Certificate , and told me that he very well approved of his Choice , and would take care of her . Court . Then he ought to be indicted for having two Wives - Officer , take him into Custody - The Woman too may be prosecuted for having two Husbands . Eleanor Byrom . My Husband Will Byrom has been dead three Quarters of a Year - And this Will Byrom in Newgate is none of my Husband , but only a Kinsman of his . The Prisoners were acquitted ; and the Court granted Freeman a Copy of his Indictment ; but advised him to take care how he frequented such disorderly Houses , and kept such ill Company . 8. Mary Jones . was indicted for stealing a Cloth Manteuil , ten Pewter Plates . and two Books , the Goods of Frances Fitch ; and a Shirt , the Goods of John Campbell , August 28 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9. Mary Wotton , was indicted for stealing twenty seven Guineas and a half , and four Shillings and six Pence . the Money of John Easton , in the House of Thomas Foxly September 2 . John Easton . This Girl was put Apprentice by the Parish to my Wife . Court . How old is she ? John Easton . She is Ten next February ; she had lived with us thirteen or fourteen Months . My Wife and I went out in the Afternoon ; I returned first about six in the Evening , and the Girl was gone . I did not search the Drawers till my Wife came home ; she had run away once before , but did not steal any thing then . We found the Drawers broken open and mist the Money . Mrs. Easton . There was twenty nine Pounds in a Spice Box in my Drawers in Mr. Foxley 's House . I went out and left only the Girl in my Room , when I returned the Girl was gone , my Drawers broke open , and the Money taken away . She was found in Rag-Fair , she owned she took the Money , and said at first , that she put it in her Bosom , and sat all Night in Moor-lane , and there a Man came and took it from her - Then she said a Woman took it out of her Apron , and at another time she told me that she gave it to a Girl who was to go out of Town with her . The Jury found her Guilty . Death . 10. Robert Tracy , was indicted for stealing a Cloth Coat and Duffel Waistcoat , the Goods of Susan Sanderson , September 6 . James Getier . My Mistress keeps a Sale-shop , the White Hart in Houndsditch . The Prisoner and one who pretended to be his Master came to our House and ordered a Coat and Waistcoat to be made for the Prisoner - The Prisoner came to fetch them and he put them on and left his old Cloths , for which he said I must allow what they were worth , and go with him to his Master at the King 's Head in Chancery-lane to receive the Ballance in Money . So I went with him , but his Master not being there he carried me to several other Taverns betwixt there and Charing-Cross to see for him ; but not finding him I told my Chap he must go back and take his old Clothes again and leave the new ones ; so we returned together till we came to St. Michael 's Alley , and there he run away from me , but I followed , and I cried stop Thief , and he was taken . Zach Bohun , Constable . The Prisoner owned to me that his pretended Master was his Companion , and that they had both contrived this Scheme on purpose to defraud the Woman of her Clothes . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 11 , 12. Ann Maund and Rachel Needham * , were indicted for privately stealing a Guinea and eight Shillings and six Pence , from the Person of Samuel Bonamy , September 5 . * She was tried last Sessions by the name of Rachel Gardener , with Will King for robbing Elizabeth Dearing of a Hat and Mob in Moor-fields , and acquitted . Sessions Paper Number 6 . Page 98. Samuel Bonamy . About eleven o'Clock last Friday Night I was got a little out of the way , as the saying is , and in Fleet-street met Rachel Needham , and one Elizabeth Taylor who is in the Compter . They laid hold on me and led me into an House and up Stairs , where we had three Quarterns of Brandy . Then Ann Maund came up to take the Reckoning ; I gave her half a Guinea , but went away and forgot my Change , and so I went back again about twelve o'Clock and asked for it , and called for another Quartern . Then she returned me eight Shillings , and they all three went out with me , and hussel 'd me in a Corner and there they left me . But I having a thought , felt in my Pocket and mist a Guinea and some Silver ; so I run after them , took Needham and carried her to the Compter . The other two were taken the same Night ; and Bess Taylor said , that Nan Maund shewed her the Guinea , and bragged of it , and then threw the Leather Bag into the Fire . Constable . We had a Warrant to take one Williams for keeping a disorderly House . We went thither and found Taylor and Maund alias Boyns ; Taylor confest that they all went out of the House with the Prosecutor , and that Maund took the Money , and threw the Bag into Williams 's Ashes ; so Taylor was sent to the Compter to be an Evidence , but she is not brought hither . Needham . The Bag was found on the Bed where he had been tumbling with Taylor . Maund . So it was , for he was in Carnal Copulation with Nan Taylor , and because he could not do it according to his mind , he swore he would be revenged upon us . Nan Taylor is more in favour with the Constable and Watch , or she had been here in our place ; as for my part I never troubled your Court before , and if you will let me go now I hope I never shall again . Acquitted . 13. Richard Ash , was indicted for stealing a pair of Silver Spurs and a Wig , the Goods of Henry Quentry ; and a pair of Silver Spurs and a Wig , the Goods of Alexander Beal , July 5 .

See summary . ] 16. Patrick Gaffney , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 5 l. from the Person of Richard Manning , August 14 . Mr. Manning . As I was going into Long-Acre between eleven and twelve in the Morning on the fourteenth of August , which was the Day the Fire happened there ; I found a great Croud of People , and before I came to the Vine Tavern I was hussel 'd about and beset by several Persons . My right Arm was held up so that I could not get it down . The Prisoner was close behind me with his left Hand on my Shoulder pushing me along . I felt my Watch pulled out of my Fobb , for my Breeches were prodigious tight . At the same time I saw the Prisoner 's right Hand in between the Skirts of my Coat , but before I could get my Arm down he had got his Hand out and turned it behind him . In that posture I seized his Hand , G - D - ye , says I , You have got my Watch . I your Watch ? says he , You are a Scoundrel , I have none of your Watch . Then says I , You have handed it to some of your Companions . Sir , says he , I am a Man of as good a Character as your self - but do not raise a Mob , and I will go with ye to the Tavern . So we went into the Tavern Kitchen , and there he readily pulled off his Coat , and I searched him , but to no purpose , upon which , he began to taunt , and threatned to make me suffer for scandalizing him . Prisoner . By the vertue of your Oath , Did you see me hand the Watch , or so much as speak to any body ? Prosecutor . No . Prisoner . Or was any body near me ? Prosecutor . Near ye , Yes , prodigiously crouded - I had my Watch just as I turned the Corner of Long Acre , and my Coat was then open , but seeing the Croud , I buttoned my Coat on purpose ; notwithstanding which , my Watch was lost before I came to the Vine . John May . I saw the Prisoner with one Hand on the Prosecutor 's Shoulder , and the other Hand under the Flap of his Coat . I heard the Prosecutor say , D - ye , I have lost my Watch ; upon which I said , That Man ( the Prisoner ) has got it . Prisoner . Why did not you seize me then ? J . May . So I did . Samuel Holditch . I was sitting on a Chest of Drawers that was brought out from the Fire . The Prisoner with his left Hand on the Prosecutor 's Shoulder pushed him up to me ; D - ye , says I , Do not squeeze my Legs ye B - ; presently I saw the Prisoner 's Hand under the Prosecutor 's Coat while two or three Men were pushing behind . I whipt off to seize the Prisoner but could not get at him for the Croud . Prisoner . I was going with Capt . Brown ( who is now at Sea ) to go to the Kentish Town Races when the Prosecutor seized me in the Croud - I have some Witnesses to my Character . John Huff , Apothecary in New Bond-street . The Prisoner lived as Journey-man to me about two Months , nine Months ago he was recommended to me for an honest Man , and behaved pretty well - He told me that he served his time to his Uncle who was a Surgeon in the Army - Indeed since he has been gone from me I have heard but an indifferent Character of him , his Name having been in the publick Papers . Prisoner . After I left Mr. Huff I went into Scotland . Mr. Eustace . I knew him several Years ago - His Family were very credible People in Dublin - But for the nine Months last past I can say nothing . John Williams I live at an Alehouse in Neal 's Yard by the Seven Dials , the Prisoner used our House for about three Months , and I never saw any hurt by him . Court . May be so - And did not Maccray come with him sometimes ? J. Williams . No ; The Prisoner always came alone , I never saw Maccray . Court . Have you no body to give an account of your Behaviour for the last nine Months ? Where is your Landlord Mabson , who kept the Brandy-shop in Cow-lane , where you lodged on the fourth of June last , when you were such a notable Surgeon for Maccray ? * * Maccray was convicted at last Kingston Assizes for robbing Mr. Hammerton on the fourth of June . Gaffney was one of Maccray 's Witnesses , and swore that Maccray was very ill , and that he attended him , and gave him a Vomit at the time the Robbery was committed . Prisoner . He is not in Town . The Jury acquitted him . He was a second time indicted for stealing two Silver Tankards value twenty eight Pound , the Goods of Phillip Shirley , in his House , June 29 . And 17. James Barthelemi for receiving the same knowing them to have been stolen , July 5 . The Witnesses were examined apart . Mr. Shirley . I keep the Hoop Tavern against Beaufort Buildings in the Strand . On Sunday the twenty ninth of June at about a Quarter before ten at Night , my House being very full of Company , two young Gentlemen came up my Passage and went into a Ground Room in the Yard , and rung the Bell . I went my self with a Candle . One of them turned his Face aside under presence of wiping it , and then laid his Head down on the Table , which gave me some Suspicion . The other called for half a Pint of Red , which being carried in they bid the Drawer send for a Coach - Do they take this for a Coffee-house , says I , Do they think it is worth my while to keep Servants to run on their Errands - Let them walk - In two Minutes my Drawer Giles Wilton came with a Pint of Lisbon for a Cool Tankard I bid him take care of the Tankard for I did not like my Customers . He said he 'd warrant the Tankard should be safe and so he carried it in . They afterwards ordered twelve Pennyworth of Beef Steaks , some of which were set by the Fire to keep warm for another Person , whom as they pretended they waited for . They bid Joseph Fisher another of my Servants bring them a Tankard of Oat Ale , and thereupon he carried in another Tankard . They sent my Porter on three Errands , and while he was gone the last time they made off with both the Tankards - A little before this , I saw one of them looking out - The large Tankard weighed sixty nine Ounces twelve Penny-weight , the other cost me Ten Pound . Gaffney . By the vertue of your . Oath am I one of the Men ? Mr. Shirley . I can not swear to either of them . John Ratcliff . On Sunday Night the twenty ninth or thirtieth of June , between nine and ten o'Clock the Prisoner and I went to the Hoop Tavern . The Room we went into was a Ground Floor on the Right-hand going up the Court . He called for half a Pint of Wine as soon as we came in , and afterwards for a Pint with Lemon and Sugar for a Cool Tankard , which were brought with a large Silver Tankard . He spoke for something to eat , and some Steaks being brought , he ordered a Tankard of Oat Ale , and that was brought too . He sent the Porter to some House in Cheapside to enquire for some Man , but I do not know what name - When the Porter returned , he sent him again to the Bull Head at Temple Bar , and when he came back from thence he bid him go to Tom King 's , and while he was gone the Prisoner went out to see if the way was clear , and finding it was , he took one Tankard and I the other and so we both went away . The Room we were in , is before we come to the Bar . Three Weeks ago I made my Information before Justice Deveil . Gaffney . This Man was catched in a Capital Offence - He was taken up for a stolen Mare , and he swears this to save his own Life . Mr. Deveil . Ratcliff was indeed taken on suspicion of stealing a Mare - Court . How did you dispose of the Tankards ? Ratcliff . Next Day about three in the Afternoon I sent Frances Charnock with the least Tankard to the Prisoner Barthelemi a Goldsmith at Charing-cross . She staid till the Evening , and when she returned she said she had sold it to him for six Pound . Court . How came you to send her thither ? Ratcliff . Because I knew Persons who had sold him Goods which he bought without asking Questions . I went my self once with John Delany , and carried a Tankard we had stolen from the Boar 's Head . The other Tankard was melted down in three or four Lumps in Gaffney 's Room while he was present , and three or four Days afterwards I carried it my self to Barthelemi ; he weighed it , and gave me nine Guineas , but I said it came to nineteen Shillings more . He reckoned it at four Shillings and nine Pence or four Shillings and ten Pence an Ounce , I can not say which . Court . Did he ask ye no Questions ? Ratcliff . He asked me if I dealt in the Country , and I answered , Yes , I deal in small Wares . I sent Charnock next Day for the nineteen Shillings , and he gave it her . Barthelemi . I bought the first Tankard for the full worth - As to what he brought I do not know what it had been , for it was melted down , and it weighed but forty three Ounces : And he being well drest , and telling me that he dealt in the Country , I had no suspicion of him . Mr. Deveil . When I had examined Ratcliff and Charnock . I sent a Warrant for the Prisoner Barthelemi . When he came I read Ratcliff 's whole Information to him , and he absolutely denied that he knew any thing of the matter ; but when I brought out Ratcliff and Charnock to confront him , he owned that he bought the Tankards , and said he gave ten Pound seven Shillings for one of them . Mr. Shirly . As one of the Tankards was whole , I desired him to return it , but he told me it was gone to the Refiners - And when Justice Deveil prest him to produce it , he said he had sold it . It was marked IER for I bought that and other Plate of the Widow Emery , who kept the Cardigan 's Head . He had frequented that House , and had often seen the Tankard there , and afterwards knew that I bought it : Besides , I advertised it , with a Description of the Mark and the Weight which was set at the bottom , and one of these Advertisements was left at his House ( as will be proved by the Man who left it ) but a few Hours before he bought it . Frances Charnock . Gaffney , and Ratcliff and I , all lodged in the same House . They came home together on Sunday Night , the twenty ninth or thirtieth of June , and brought two Silver Tankards which they said me they had got from the Hoop Tavern . Next Day about three in the Afternoon , I went to Barthelemi 's House with the small Tankard . He was not at home , but his Wife desired me to stay , which I did . And soon after he came in , he lighted Candles , and shut up the Shop . He asked me no Questions how I came by it , but I told him without asking , that I came from Mr. Ratcliff . Then he weighed the Tankard in a Room behind the Shop , and cast it up on a Piece of Paper , and told me how many Ounces it weighed , and how much it was an Ounce , but I have forgot both , only I remember he said it came to six Pound three Shillings , or wanting three Shillings , I do not know which . Then he asked me where I lived , I told him in Holborn - I then lived in Gray 's Inn-lane - He said he was going that way to meet some Company , and he would see me so far homeward . So he went with me to the upper end of St. Martin 's Lane in Long Acre , and would have gone farther but I refused , and so we parted , and I carried the Money to Ratcliff , who gave half of it to Gaffney . Barthelemi . Did not I ask you how you came by it ? Charnock . No , not a Word . Barthelemi . Did not you pass for the Wife of one Johnson , and bring a Note ? Charnock . No . Barthelemi . You did , and you said your Husband had had a Suit of Law in the Country , and on that account you was forced to sell the Tankard - What Letters was it marked with ? Charnock . I do not know . Barthelemi . It was not on Monday that you brought it , but on Thursday . Court . Produce your Books and contradict her if you can , by shewing a regular Entry . Barthelemi . I keep no Books - I can not write - [ As this was hardly spoke loud enough for the Court to hear him distinctly , he dropt this Pretence and said ] - I set it down so in my Book , and that I gave her six Pound nineteen Shillings . Mr. Deveil . After I had brought him to own that he bought the Tankards , he took me aside into another Room , and told me this matter might prove very troublesome to him , but it was in my power to make it more agreeable , and if I would go to his Shop he would make it easy to me , or Words to that effect : When I came back with him into the other Room , I asked him before twenty or thirty People , if he was not ashamed to offer to bribe me ? He answered , that what he intended to give me - was only his Prayers . Mr. Shirley . He sent for me into the same Room , and offered me twenty , twenty five , and then thirty Guineas if I would be easy - Will your Lordship please to ask Charnock about her selling him a Silver Pint Mug that was stolen from the Crown Tavern by GuildHall . Court . No , I can not enquire into particular Facts for which he is not indicted . Barthelemi . I gave her five Shillings an Ounce for a Silver Mug . Court . Why will you needs take this upon your self ? John Holton I am a Messenger to the Goldsmith 's Company . On Monday , June 30. between three and four in the Afternoon , I left a Printed Advertisement of the same Tenour as this in my Hand at Barthelemi 's Shop , and I think I gave it to his Wife . It contains a Description of the two Tankards , the Marks , Weight , and Size . Then he read the Advertisement in Court . Gaffney to Charnock . Did not you live with Ratcliff as his Wife , and go by his Name ? Charnock . Yes , I did . Gaffney . How many were concerned in stealing the Tankards ? Mr. Shirley . Two . Gaffney . The unfortunate Dr. Dunn was tried here last Sessions for stealing these Tankards ; and did not you and your Servants swear positively that he was one of the two Men ? Shirley . I never did , nor do I swear to you . Gaffney . It would be but Justice to bring your Servants here , to see if any of them know me . Shirley . I did send two of them to the Gate-house , and they said they did not know the Prisoner . Gaffney . Very Good ! Barthelemi . I have Witness to prove that I gave to the Value of the Plate . Mr. Mansfield , Goldsmith . The usual Price of Old Sterling Tankards when melted . is five Shillings , or five Shillings one Penny an Ounce , for there is a vast deal of Sodder in it . Mr. Shirley . The Tankards were both New Sterling . Mr. Mansfield . Then they were worth three Pence an Ounce more . Lewis Laroch , Silversmith . I offered to sell Mr. Barthelemi a Tankard at a Crown an Ounce , but it was Old Sterling . Mr. Pattison , a Turner . I live opposite to Barthelemi ; he works hard in his Shop from Morning to Night - I have seen him buy Goods publickly , and never thought that he would buy any thing in a private clandestine way ; for I took him to be as honest a Man as lived . Court . Have you never heard of his absconding on some account ? Pattison . I have heard that an Action at Common Law was brought against him for a Watch ; and that thereupon he went abroad because he had not Money to pay for the Watch and Charges . Barthelemi I stopt a Maid for offering to sell me a Tea-pot , till she sent for her Mistress . German Bonette . I was not present when the Maid came by her self , but I saw the Maid and her Mistress together in his Shop ; and he told me that he had obliged the Maid to send for her Mistress . Several others deposed that they believed him to be a fair Dealer , and that he would not knowingly buy Plate that he suspected to be stolen . The Jury found them both Guilty . Gaffney received Sentence of Death , and Barthelemi to be transported for fourteen Years . 18. William Lewis , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of Daniel Lee in the Night , and stealing three Silver Tankards , value 20 l. May 23 . And 19. Elizabeth Morris , Wife of John Morris , for receiving the same knowing them to be stolen , May 24 . Daniel Lee , at the Rose and Crown Alehouse in Short 's Gardens . My House was broke open May 23 , between twelve and one in the Morning . The Entrance was made at my Window , from whence they came through the Celler , broke open a Cupboard , and took the three Tankards , which weighed about eighty Ounces . Abraham Davenport . The Prisoner Lewis and I , committed this Fact . He pulled up one of the Bars with his Hand , and with that Bar he wrenched up the others ; and then I standing to watch , he went in and brought out the Tankards . We went with them first to Mrs. Pritchard 's at the Brill , but it being so soon in the Morning , she would not let us in , and so we carried them to Mrs. Morris , in Eagle Court in the Strand , and knocked her up about two in the Morning . Her Husband let us in . At first she seem 'd scrupulous of dealing with us , for she said she had been in trouble on the like Account . * Lewis had been recommended to her , but she said she did not know that I went abroad ( that is a Thieving . ) though she knew something of me when I was Apprentice to a Glass Blower in the Strand . We told her she need fear no harm from us , for no body was concerned in it but our selves . About eight the same ( Saturday ) Morning , her Son fetched some Charcoal to melt the Plate . We melted it below Stairs while she was above , and then we carried it up to her . She weighed it with old Leaden Weights , and said there was forty six Ounces in all , and reckoning it at four Shillings an Ounce it came to nine Pound odd . She gave us five Guineas then , and the Remainder on the Thursday following - I made my Information seven or eight Weeks ago before Justice Deveil . * She was tried in April , 1733. but acquitted . She was an Evidence for William Roberts alias Hampton , in December , 1732. Edward Post . I had a Warrant ( on the Information of Margery Williams ) for apprehending Lewis . In the Morning when she came to go with me , she bid me take help enough , for he was very desperate . We went to his Lodging next to the Black Jack in Dyot Street about seven in the Morning , and the Door being ajar , we entered and seized him abed . In the Room we found all these things , two Hangers , a Pick-lock-key , a Dark Lanthorn , Pistols , Powder and Bullets . Davenport . This Pick-lock-key we bought of Morris 's Son . Morris . I was not at home at the time he swears they sold me this Plate . Mary Elwall . I went to her House four Days before Whitsuntide , and she being ill , I invited her to come to my House in Swan Alley in Goswell street for the benefit of the Air ; and so she came and staid there nine or ten Days . Sarah Richmond . I remember it very well , for I lodged at Mrs. Elwall 's at the same time . The Jury found them both Guilty . Lewis received Sentence of Death ; and Morris to be transported for fourteen Years . 20.

Joshua Dean , Callico Print-Cutter , was indicted for making on one Sheet of Blank Paper , three counterfeit Impressions in imitation of three true Sixpenny Stamps , thereby designing to diminish the Revenue and defraud his Majesty of the Duties of six Pence , six Pence , and six Pence granted by certain Statutes , May 30 . In the Parish of St. Mary le Bow in London . Elihu Bridoak . In July 1734. the Prisoner told me that he could counterfeit the Stamps on Paper so exactly , as not to be distinguished from the true Stamps ; and if I would be concerned with him I should have half the Profits . He sent me to the Stamp Office for two treble six Penny Stamps , which I fetched to him . By these he made counterfeit Stamps , and thinking his House in St. George 's Fields not convenient , I took an empty House by his Order in New-street , to which place we carried the Press and Fly and Crucibles and Metals and other Materials for coining Guineas and stamping Paper . We stamped several Reams of Paper which I distributed , some to Robert Whitworth of Manchester for twenty five Shillings a Quire the treble six penny , and seventeen Shillings the double ; I sent him thirty Quire at one time ; some to Mr Wheatly ( or Heatly ) at Chester ; some to Mr. Parsons at New Castle , and some to others . I was present and saw the Prisoner put the Stamps on these five blank Sheets in March last , but these were not done in New-Street , but at Mrs . Petty 's in Paul 's Alley in Aldersgate Street , where we hired a Garret , about the end of February last : Nothing of the old Press was moved thither from New Street except the Fly , but we had a new Press made by one Boddington . When Benjamin Bowtell the Stationer was apprehended for selling counterfeit Stamp Paper , the Prisoner removed all the things from Paul 's Alley to his House in St. George 's Fields , except this Fly of the old Press , which was afterwards found in Paul 's Alley by Mr. Lunnies . The new Press was first put together at Bowtell 's , and the Prisoner sent me to bring it from thence to Paul 's Alley : I went , and Bowtell pulled it from under the Bed , and said there is your Tackle . The Paper we stampt for Whitworth , Heatly , and Parsons , was doue with the old Press . Hearing that Bowtell was taken , I went to his House and found things in confusion : On Saturday the twenty ninth or thirtieth of May , his Wife told me that her Husband was arrested for Debt , and asked me where the Prisoner was , for her Husband wanted to speak with him ; I went to the Prisoner over the Water and he told me that Bowtell was taken for selling Stamps though but few had been found at his House , but if search was made they might find more , for he had sent to Bowtell two Quire of two Shilling and three Penny Stamps , and six Quire of double Penny but the Day before . I told him Bowtell wanted to speak to him ; the Prisoner answered , As he is in Custody , the Key may be turned upon me , and that may be as much as my Life is worth ; but do you go to him and desire him for God 's sake to hold his Tongue , for my Life depends upon his Taciturnity . Several Witnesses deposed , that in searching the House in St. George 's Fields , they found two Presses , several Stamps , Dies and Punches , and other Materials for Coining and Stamping . Mr. Rollos , the King 's Engraver , deposed that those Punches were proper for repairing Stamps after they were cast ; and that the Stamp Paper produced in Court was counterfeit . John Withers . After the House in St. George 's Fields had been searched , the Door was left open and my Hen run in ; I run after her , and clapt my Hand upon this Brass Six Penny Stamp , marked Y . This Place was hired by one Watts , an elderly Man , and I have seen him and the Prisoner go in there two or three times in the Day time , but I never saw the Prisoner go in alone . This was two or three Weeks before the search - This Paper was found up two pair of Stairs . - Wagstaff . I have seen the Prisoner write several times , and I take this Writing to be his Hand . Then the Paper was read ; and part of it was as follows : March . 6 qr of triple 3 qr of double 6 qr of prints Ball . due from New Cas . 17 . 16 . 0 Mar . 27 . 28 24 Indentures 12 Bonds performance 1 qr of triple 12 bonds April 7 4 qr triple 1 double 13 . 10 . 0 Mr. Lunnies . I found this Pocket-book up two pair of Stairs . - Wagstaff . This part is like his Hand - but this derogates - I can not be positive to this . John Boddington . This great Press I made by the Prisoner 's Direction , and he paid me for it . Prisoner . Did I alone employ you ? Boddington . Bridoak was with you - I made the Box and Screw of that other Press for Bridoak and after it was made , he and Bridoak came to look at it , and they said they liked it . Prisoner . Was I present when it was taken away and paid for ? Boddington . Bridoak fetched it from my Shop in Islington Road , and to the best of my rememberance the Prisoner was with him . Prisoner , Bridoak swore that I sent him to fetch that Press from Bowtell 's House . Mr. Lunnies . I went with a Warrant to take the Prisoner at his little House at Lambeth Marsh . The Constable and Mr. Wigley found him in the Garden , but he got away . Mr. Rollos . I found him in an empty House . He had clambered up on the outside into a Cock Lost , where he lay on his Back . I called him and he came down - I found a Gun and a Pistol at his House - In a Room up one pair of Stairs among some Bricks and Shavings , in the House in St. George 's Fields , there was as much Stamp Paper as came to forty or fifty Pound . Mrs . Petty . Bridoak a Month before Lady Day , hired my Garret in Paul 's Alley , and the Prisoner used to come there and lye with him for about two Months , but Bridoak staid longer - I once heard a thumping . Mr . Page . On January 29 , 1733 , I let an empty House in New-street to Bridoak for a Year . I met him afterwards by chance , and he said he was going to France - On Lady Day last he brought me the Key - I do not know whether he had any Furniture in the House or not . It is a White House . Sarah Fell . I live in New-street . The Prisoner and Bridoak have often been at our House , which is an Ale-house . I have seen them go together to the White House . Prisoner . It has been represented , as if there was no Furniture in that House . Did not Bridoak lodge there ? S. Fell . I think he did , but am not sure . I have carried Drink to the House , but I never went but just within the Door - I have seen a Bedstead there . Prisoner . Bridoak owns himself to be an Accomplice . He owns he was concerned in the whole Affair , and he has made himself rich by that means . But I was so poor that I was not able to carry on a little Law Suit . He pretended to be a Sollicitor . I employed him to recover a Debt , and so our Acquaintance begun . He brought me some little printed Marks to copy for him , and among them there was one for Daffy 's Elixir , and as I had not Money , I was satisfying him this way for managing my Law Suit ; but when I observed that most of these Marks had Crowns upon them , I suspected they might be put to an ill use , and therefore I would meddle with none but Daffy . In short I was forced to sell my Wig to carry on this Suit , and yet when he had got the Money , he put it in his own Pocket . If I had been concerned in a Practice by which he has got so much , it is reasonable to think that I might have got something too . His own Terror has brought him to a Confession : He knew that I was acquainted with some of his Secrets , and for fear I should discover them ; he charges me with what he himself is guilty of , and would take away my Life to save his own . Has he not been tryed in this Place , * and convicted at Kingston ? - I had taken a House at Liverpool , and put all my Tools and Cloaths on board the Ship Suttle on the ninth of May , to send thither . And when I was taken , I directed Mr. Lunnies at what House he might find them ; I have since been informed that he has been there , and if he had found any thing that related to Coining or Stamping , I should have heard of it before now . * In April 1732. Ebenezer Harvey alias Bodicoat , was tryed for stealing the Goods of Susan Calf , in the House of Ann Collier , but was acquitted . Mr. Lunnies . I searched that House , and found only his Callicoe Prints , three Suits of Clothes , and other odd things , but nothing relating to the Stamp Office . Prisoner . If the other things that were found in St George 's Fields had been mine , is it not likely that I should have sent them away too - As to the piece of Writing that is supposed to be my Hand , it might as well be the Evidence 's Writing , for he counterfeited my Hand in a Receipt , as I could prove by Giles Bradshaw , who proved last Sessions that Bridoak was concerned for me in a Law Suit , which was the Reason of my being often with him ; but that Witness is not now in Court - Here is George Boddington Brother to John Boddington to prove that the Press was made for Bridoak G. Boddington . I made part of the Press for Bridoak about a Year ago - I never saw the Prisoner at my Shop . Prisoner . The House in St. George 's Fields where the things were found , did not belong to me . John Edby . That House is mine ; I let it to old Watts , who said he intended to do something in Chymestry there - As for the Prisoner , I do not know that I ever saw him before now . George Watts . I am no kin to old Watts . I am a Leather Gilder , my Master had a Ground next to the Prisoner 's Ground at Lambeth Marsh ; a small Ditch parts them , but there is a Plank lies over it , so that we frequently went into one anothers Ground : I have been often in , and all through his House , both when he has been at and from Home , and I never saw any thing like a Secret there : and from our Ground we can look through every Window of his House . Prisoner . Bridoak gave old Wats notice to get out of the way , when I was taken . Edward Harbert . Three Days after the Prisoner was taken , Bridoak came to the House where I lodged , and asked me if Watts lodged there . I said yes , he said he wanted to leave a Line for him , and so he took a piece of Paper and wrote upon it thus : Mr Dean does not want to see you , till he returns out of the Country . I delivered that Paper into Court last Sessions : I understood this as Caution for old Watts to keep out of the way - I have seen the Prisoner and Watts together , I think twice . Then several Witnesses appeared to the Prisoner 's Character . They deposed that they took him for an honest industrious inoffensive Man . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . 41. Benjamin Bowtell , Stationer , was indicted for vending one Blank Sheet of Paper , having on it three Counterfeit Impressions resembling three Six-penny Stamps , he knowing the same to be Counterfeit , May 30 , in the Parish of St. Mary le Bow in London . Elihu Bridoak . The Prisoner was very intimate with Dean , they were seldom a Day asunder . I and Dean took part of the Press from the Prisoner 's House in Butcher-hall-lane , carried it to Lambeth , where it was fitted up , and afterwards left at the Prisoner 's House . When Dean and I removed to Paul 's Alley , he sent me to fetch this Press thither . I went and asked the Prisoner for the Press that was left by Mr. Dean . The Prisoner drew it from under the Bed , and said , There is your Tackle . I carried it to Paul 's Alley , and there we stamped this Paper - One Evening , Dean , Bacon , the Prisoner , and my self were drinking together , when the Prisoner said to Mr. Bacon , If you or your Friends can take off Stamps , I will use you well , and give you two or three Months Credit . The Prisoner being committed to Wood-Street Compter , I asked Dean to go and see him . Dean said it was not so proper for him to go , for if the Key was turned upon him , it might be as much as his Life was worth , but do you go , says he , and tell him , that his own Safety as well as mine lies on his being secret . So I went , and the Prisoner told me that he had then in the House two Quire of Two and Three-penny Stamps , and six Quire of Double-penny , which he had received from Dean the Day before ; but the main Bulk of Stamps was in a Box at a Coffee-house , where he and Dean had lodged , and he was afraid it was seized ; but if it was not he would give Orders to remove it . He added that he had confest nothing , and that he would say he had bought the Stamps of one of the same Trade who had newly left off the Business , and was a Holland Trader - Dean dealt with the Prisoner for Paper . The Prisoner once sent some Paper by me to Dean , and told me that Dean knew what to do with it . Prisoner . Did you ever see Dean deliver a Sheet to me , or see me sell a Sheet ? Bridoak . No , but Dean told me so . William Rutland On the twentieth of May , the Prisoner sold these ten printed Stamps and these eleven Blanks to my Master John Willis in Tower Street for three Shillings in Money , and the rest in Paper . I delivered them to - Jewks , to carry to the Stamp Office . - Jews . I saw the Prisoner sell these for three Shillings , and a Ream of Paper . Mr. Rollos . Mr. Lunnies , and Mr. Sydenham deposed that these were Counterfeits . Peter Barber , Stationer in St. Paul 's Church Yard . Sometime in April last the Prisoner brought me twenty Sheets of Treble Six-penny Stamps . Mr. Rollos and Mr. Sydenham deposed that these were Counterfeits . Edward Wrench . On the ninth of May last , I bought seventeen Sheets of Stamps of the Prisoner . I put them in my Drawer among other Stamps , and when I heard he was taken , I carried them with my Name to them to Mr. Rollos . Mr. Rollos . I received these from Mr. Wrench , they are Counterfeit , and are marked with the Letter Y , which is the Stamp that was sworn to be counterfeited by Dean . Mr. Brown , Constable Here are about ten Quires which I found in several Drawers in the Prisoner 's Bed Chamber , but none in his Shop . Joseph Bacon , Attorney . In April or May last , the Prisoner told me that one Mr. Dean had some Business to do in my way . We all met . This Business was about a Suit to compel one Wigley to specify performance of an Agreement that had been made betwixt him and Dean . I told the Prisoner that the Suit would be very expensive , and he said he would be my Paymaster . Sometime after , he asked me if Stamps would not do as well as Money . I answered , yes , and took Stamps of him to the value of seven or eight Pound ; the chief part of which I sold to Mr. Smith , a Stationer . Mr. Smith . These are the same , I delivered them to the Commissioners . Mr. Rollos . These are Counterfeit Six-penny , marked O and T. Mr. Bacon . The Prisoner being committed on Saturday Evening , I went to him on Sunday Morning , and desired him to make me a Bill of what Stamps I had received of him . He begun to write on the Leaf of a Pocket-book ; but before he had finished , he tore it , and said , he would have nothing in his own Hand to appear against him ; but however he would clear me at all Events , and take the blame on himself . Prisoner . You own you sold some of them again . Are not you then as guilty as I ? You may say you did not know they were Counterfeit , and I can say the same . James Burnet . I received Rent of the Prisoner for my Brother . He desired me to take part in Stamps . March twelve , I took one Pound ten Shillings in Treble Six-penny , and ten Pence in Paper . May the twenty eighth Twelve Double Six-penny - six Quire of Double penny , and Six Treble Six-penny Bonds . In all three Pound eighteen Shillings and seven Pence . I had used eight Shillings worth in my Business , but finding them Counterfeit , I threatened to strain , and thereupon his Wife paid me the rest of the Rent except nine Pence . Mr. Rollos . These are all Counterfeit . Prisoner . I own I might have sold the Stamps now produced , but I bought them of Bridoak at the full price . Abel Fern , Book binder , in Bishop 's Gate Street . I was at work in the Prisoner 's Shop about May last , when I saw Bridoak sell him a Quire of Treble Six Penny Stamps , for which the Prisoner paid three Shillings and six Pence . Bridoak . I never sold him any , nor ever saw this Man in my life . Samuel Bell ( the Prisoner 's Apprentice . ) I saw my Master settle an Accompt with Bridoak for two Pound nine Shillings the beginning of March last . Bridoak gave my Master a Quire and a half of Treble Six Penny Stamps , and my Master gave him five Shillings to ballance . The Account was for Work and Goods . Bridoak . He binds Books in Vellum , and he bound some Pocket Books for me to send to New Castle , and I paid him twenty five Shillings - It is no usual for Book-binders to have many Stamps , and I never knew that he dealt in them till he was acquainted with Dean . The Jury acquitted him . Joshua Dran , was a second time indicted for High Treason in making four Pieces of Counterfeit Money , with Brass , Copper , and other Base Metals in the likeness of Guineas , May 27 , in the seventh Year of his Majesty 's Reign , in the Parish of St . Brides in London . Elihu Bridoak . In December , 1733. the Prisoner began to make Dies for counterfeiting the present Coin . He finished them in January . I took Mr . Page 's House in New Street , in order to Coin there . We carried thither the Bellows , and other Materials . He built the Furnace himself , and set up the Press , and provided Gold , Silver , and Copper . We made a great many Guineas , of which I distributed some hundreds . There was as much Gold in each as was worth fifteen Shillings We continued Coining till we went to stamping Paper . I know that these two Guineas were of his making , and I can pick them out from a Number of others , by a particular Mark . The Difference is in the Mouth and Lips , tho ' it is not easily distinguished by a cursory View . Mr. North . When Bridoak gave me Information of these Guineas , I asked him if he had got any of them . He said , No , but he knew them by the Lips , and could pick them out from good ones . I desired Mr. Maddoches of the Bank , to procure me three or four . Their Out tellers got four , which were mixt in a Bag with one hundred and ninety six good ones . Bridoak turned them over and picked out four , and I found them to be all Counterfeit . I gave two of them to an Officer of the Tower to make an Assay of their real value . Thomas Whitaker . Mr. North gave me two Guineas . I tried them at the Assay Office . I found them to be Counterfeit , and worth about fifteen Shillings a-piece . Brodoak 's picking out the four Guineas from two Hundred was confirmed by Mr. Martin . Prisoner . Ask Mrs. Fell of New Street , if she knows Watts , or has seen him at her House ? Mrs. Fell . I have seen on old Man named Watts : They said he was a Watchmaker . He mended my Clock , and my Husband 's Watch . He lived then in Stone Cutters Street , which is in our Neighbourhood . Prisoner . All these Materials were his , and they were found in his Possession . He and Bridoak took this House in New Street , and carried on the Design between them . The Jury acquitted him . 42.

The Prisoner has been Sir Robert Walpole 's Bricklayer about eleven Years . On the eighteenth of August , he came to Sir Robert 's House at Chelsea , and was in the Pantry amongst the Plate . for being well known in the Family , we had no mistrust of him . John Wilmot . I live with Mr. Gilpin , a Goldsmith by Lincoln 's Inn Back Gate . On the nineteenth of August , the Prisoner came to our Shop , and said , he had a little piece of Plate to dispose of , and then he produced this Escallop 'd Silver Salver . Seeing a Crest on it , I asked him whose it was . He said he did not know , for it was left him by his first Wife . I told him I must stop the Plate till he could satisfy me how he came by it . He asked me what I meant by that , and said , he could soon fetch one that knew him ; and so he went and fetched Mr. Stafford from the Stamp Office . Mr. Stafford told me who the Prisoner was , and said that he believed him to be an honest Man - I looked into a Book of Arms , and thought the Crest was like the Duke of Chandos 's . But on my going thither , I was told it was Sir Robert Walpole 's . I went to Sir Robert 's , and there the Plate was owned . Mr. Wright again . This is the same Salver that was lost out of Sir Robert 's Pantry . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 57. Edward Williams , was indicted for stealing three Sheep Skins and two Buck Skins , the Goods of Henry Bullock , July 27 . Mr. Bullock . The Prisoner worked for me about six Weeks . He went away on Saturday , July 26. and pretended that he was going to Bristol . Richard King . My Master Bullock of Colebrook keeps a Warehouse here in Town which I look after . He employs forty or fifty Servants , and when he wants a Hand he sends to me - I sent the Prisoner to him about three Months ago . On the twenty ninth of July , 1 heard that a Man was stopt with some of my Master 's Goods . I went and found the Prisoner , and these Skins , which I believe to be my Master 's . I asked him how he came by them ; he said he found them , and as he was coming to bring them to me he was stopt ; but though he found them , he would pay me for them if I would give him no farther trouble - They had not the King 's Stamp on them . Sarah Laws . On Tuesday , July 29 , between four and five in the Afternoon , the Prisoner came to my House with two Bundles , and called for a Pint of Beer . He desired me to let him leave those Bundles . I put them behind the Bar . Then he said , he wished I could let him lye there if it was but for one Night , for he wanted a Lodging , and there were so many wicked Houses about Town , that a sober Man could hardly find a Place to lay his Head in - At Night my Maid lighted him up Stairs , and when she came down she said she wondered I would let that strange Man lay there , for though he pretended so much Godliness , he had been very rude to her , and forced his Hand up her Coars . Upon this , we examined his Bundles , and found they were wet Skins , and suspecting he did not come honestly by them , we got a Constable , and made the Prisoner get up . And then he denied that ever he delivered the Skins to me . William Spicer , Beadle . When I saw the Skins were wet , and had no Stamps on them , I sent for a Constable . The Prisoner at first refused to rise , and denied that he brought the Bundles . He told us however that he worked for Mr. Bullock , at Colebrook . Upon which , one who was present , said , that Mr. Bullock had a Ware-house in Town , and so sent for King who belongs to the Ware-house . J. Robinson . I know these are my Master Bullock 's Skins by the Marks , for each of his Men marks his own Work , that if there is any Fault we may know who to blame . Prisoner . I would not have left my Master but for the Wickedness of his Workmen , for they were so given to drink Gin , that I who had always behaved my self with Sobriety , could not bear to see them go on in that pernicious Practice . As for the Skins , I found them on this side Colebrook , and considering with my self that they might belong to my Master , I resolved as I was going to London , that I would deliver them to his Ware-house-keeper there . And this was my Design , on my Word and Truth , and as I hope for Mercy in the Kingdom of Heaven . But for Christ 's Sake ! for the Lord Jesus Sake ! let me have my Punishment in my own Country . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 58.

Mr. Deveil . This Deposition on Oath , I took from the Mouth of the Deceased as she lay in her Bed at Kensington Gravel Pits , on the twenty eighth of July last , and she died on the second of August following . The Information was read , to the following purpose . That one Pickup a Brewer , came to her House , at the Time the Races were at Hounslow , being about three Weeks ago , and finding her alone , he went into her back Parlour , and proposed to lye with her , which she refusing , he seized her about the Waste , and struggled with her so long , that by his Violence in attempting to ravish her , she apprehended he broke something within her , and bruised her Kidneys which she immediately felt . That he did attempt to ravish her , and by force took up her Coats , and that she has not been able for a Fortnight after to make Water , and that she believes it will be the Cause of her Death . Mr. Deveil , further deposed . That he found her in a bad Condition , and that in his Judgment , she was a dying Woman , in great Pain and Misery , that she gave rational Answers , and seemed to speak with all imaginable Veracity . John Fletcher deposed , that on the twenty eighth of June , he went to the Hounslow Races between one and two in the Afternoon , and returned about seven in the Evening , when he found his Wife crying , and asking her the reason , she said she would not be left alone any more : That next Morning she said she was very bad , and shewed him her Water , which war bloody ; but he thought it no more than usual , she having been troubled with the Stone and Gravel , but he had heard no Complaint of that nature for a Month before , and that he left her well when he went from Home . That nine or ten Days afterwards , she told him that Pickup the Brewer had been there , and finding her alone , went into the back Parlour , and called for a Pint of Wine : And when she carried it to him , he locked the Door , threw his Arms round her Waste , and threw her down , and put his Hands up her Coats , and attempted to ravish her , that she got up again , and threw up the Sash , and got half out , but he pulled her back , and offered her a Cellar full of Beer to lye with her . That he went to the Prisoner 's House , to know why he had abused his Wife , but he was not in Town . That a Week after this , the Prisoner sent him some Two-penny , which the Evidence returned , whereupon the Prisoner came with Mr. Mosely , and huffed the Evidence , and asked why he sent back the Drink , to which he answered : You Villain how dare you come to my House , and abuse my Wife . That his Wife hearing the Prisoner 's Voice , called out and said , That Villain at the Door has been the Death of me . Being asked if his Wife might not have been heard , if she had cryed out when the Prisoner assaulted her ; he answered , that she did not cry out , for he struggled with her half an Hour , and she was out of breath : He added that she was attended in her Ilness by Dr. Beaufort , Dr. Bloxham and others , and being cross-examined , he said he believed his Wife did not tell the Doctors how her Disorder began ; that he did not ask them what they thought was the cause of it , nor did they tell him . Elizabeth Sheham , deposed , that the Deceased sent for her seventeen Days before her Death , she complained of a violent Fit of the Cholick , and said she had been ill two Days before , and believed she had got it by eating Beans and Bacon , but this Evidence thought it was the Gravel . Dr. Beaufort About the nineteenth of July , the Deceased sent for me , and said she had been ill three or four Days , was in great Pain , and under a total suppression of Urine . I believe it proceeded from the Stone , and directed as for a suppression of Urine . I visited her three or four times , but she would take nothing , and so I went no more . She never complained of receiving any Bruises , or any Disorder about her Kidneys . Being asked if taking a Woman round the Waste , and struggling with her , could bruise her Kidneys , so as to be felt . He said he did not think that so doing could have such an Effect . Being farther asked , if a Stone in the Kidneys might not by Violence be removed , and so cause that suppression of Urine , he replied that it was not to be done by any Violence that could be used in hugging and squeezing . Dr. Bloxham deposed , that he attended the Deceased in March or April , she had severe Vomiting , and all the Symptoms of the Stone , for which he directed . That he saw her three Days after his Direction , and she had voided a little Stone . That about the end of July she told him she had had a suppression of Urine for seven Days , which he took to be the Stone , and ordered a Warm Bath . That neither she nor her Husband ever told him that she received any Bruise . Being asked , if Squeezing and Struggling could bruise her Kidneys , so as to be immediately felt . He answered he did not apprehend any such thing could happen ; but perhaps it was possible that a violent Wrench or sudden Distortion of the Body might dislodge a Stone and throw it into the Ureter . Sir Richard Manningham deposed , that on the thirtieth of July , he was sent for to meet Dr. Burton , at the Plough at Kensington , from whence they went to the Deceas'd 's House . The Deceased said she had been abused , and had not made Water for a Fortnight . He told her that was a long time indeed , and ( letting her know his Profession ) he laid his Hand on her Belly , and found a Tension . He pulled out his Catherer , but a Woman who was present cried out , No , We will have no Experiments - she has been prob 'd already . He then let them know he had no farther business there . The Woman told him he had frighted the Deceas 'd to death , and she might lay her Death to him . He said , they might do as they would , provided they did not swear he had ravished her . And so he stept down to Dr. Burton , and told him it was well if there was no Trick - They both went up , and were met by one who said they might search now - He did examine , and found no Water in the Bladder . They pretended she was bruised , and that the Child was killed within her . He offered to take the Child away , but upon searching , there was neither Child nor Bruise to be found . That he saw the Deceased in half a quarter of an Hour after she was dissected , and could perceive no sign of any Bruises , or of her being with Child ; that her Kidneys were emaciated by a settling of Gravel . That the Surgeon shewed him two Stones , and told him that the biggest had been fixt in the ureter going out of the kidney , and the other at the insertion of the ureter into the Bladder , and that he believed her Death was owing to those Stones only . Being asked if he thought those Stones had been there for some time , or had been removed thither by some sudden Violence . He answered , the Kidneys were so well guarded that no Struggle could remove those Stones . Mr. Chovet , a Surgeon , deposed . that he opened the Body and found a large Stone in the right Kidney at the Exit of the Pelvis , that he found no inward or outward Bruises ; that from the Conformation of the Parts , the Water arising like the Swan-neck of an Alembic , or the Letter S , he thought it evident that the Stones could not fall into the places where they were found by means of any struggling . The Court having summed up the Evidence , the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 60. Thomas Gray , was indicted for assaulting , and carnally knowing , and abusing Frances Colomies , an Infant , of the Age of eight Years April 4 . Mr. Deveil deposed that on the twenty fourth of July , the Prisoner was brought before him for a Rape . That there were several strong Depositions against him ; that he admitted he had plaid and been familiar with the Child , and had even taken some indecent Liberties , but never offered to ravish her , or any thing like it . Eleanor Cox , a Midwife , deposed , that on the twenty fourth of June , she found the Child much disorder 'd with an Inflammation , and did believe she had been injur 'd by a Man . Sarah Colomies . ( the Child 's Mother ) deposed , that being left to take care of Sir . Robert Birch 's House by Soho Square , where the Prisoner , who is a Carpenter , was at work , he came up Stairs , and told her one Mr. Wadsworth had been there , and desired she would come to his House ; that she went thither , leaving none but her Child and the Prisoner in the House : That this was on a Friday , and on the Monday following which was Easter Monday , she first discovered her Child 's Disorder , and concluded by what she saw , a Man had been rude with her . That upon her examining the Child , she fell on her Knees , and said that one Gray did it . This Witness being asked , why she staid above three Months before she made her Information against the Prisoner , she answered that in about a Fortnight after the Injury was done , she wrote to Sir Robert Rich , who ordered her to apply to his Attorney : That she went to his Attorney twice , that Sir , Robert likewise directed her to go to Mr. Stevens a Surgeon , and let him search the Child and she did so , that she talked with the Prisoner ; and told him she was afraid he had given the Child some ill Distemper ; but he assured her he had not , and promised to make Satisfaction : That his Wife was very ill , and begged her not to prosecute him , for if she did , it would be the ruin of their Family - He was discharged from working in Sir Robert 's House , in about two Weeks after the Fact . Mr. Stevens deposed , that the Mother brought the Child to him , as from Sir Robert Rich , that she complained the Child had a little Moisture , but when he saw the Child there was none , though it was a common thing with less than she : That thereupon he advised her Mother to go about her Business , for the Child was very well ; he was positive there had been no Penetration . And that Sir . Robert 's Attorney said it was so dirty an Affair , that he would not be concerned in it . Another Surgeon depos 'd , that there had been no Laceration of the Part , without which it was impossible , there should have been any Penetration . That indeed there was a little Moisture when he saw it , which was after the Prisoner was taken up , but that he had seen a hundred Children in the same Case . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 61,62,63,64. Richard Freeman , was indicted with Richard Bromingham , John Franligan , Abram Web , the younger , and Rose Jackson , for the Murder of Jeremy Gray , Bromington , by giving Gray with a Hurling Stick one Mortal Wound on the right Side of the Head , of the length of three Inches , and breadth of half an Inch , September I , of which he languished till the seventh of the same Month , and then died .

Being asked if she knew the Prisoners before ? She said she had never seen any of the Company before ; but that one Nathaniel Walker told her Togwell 's Name , and she knew him again by a Mark in his Face ; and that some body told her Brother that Matthews was at the Yorkshire Grey in Drury Lane , bragging of what he had done . She added , that she went next Day to Justice Deveil and made her Information . Mr. Deveil deposed , that Arn , Harding , and Togwell were named in her Information as three of the Persons who had actually ravished her , and several others were described .

That this Evidence was in her Shift at the Window when she saw all this ; and she bid her Neighbours throw Chamber Pots or any thing upon them .

I was desired to go up , which I did , and somebody followed me with a Light : I saw the Prisoner standing with a Cane in one Hand , and a Broomstick in the other , and the Deceased leaning on his Crutch , with nothing upon him but his Shirt , and night Cap . I advised the Deceased to go up to Bed again ; I had hardly spoke , when the Prisoner put out the Candle , and immediately I heard a violent Blow struck , and felt the Blood run down my Arm . Another Candle was presently brought , and the Prisoner then had the Broomstick in his Hand , and it was bloody at the biggest end . I heard no provoking Words from the Deceased , and it was impossible that he should give any Blows , because he could not stand without his Crutch . Mary Lamb . I live below Stairs in the same House ; about three Months before this Misfortune , the Prisoner had like to have killed the Deceased , by striking him with his Cane , for which Reason the Deceased 's Daughter took that Cane and hid it - So on the seventh of July , about ten at Night the Prisoner came in , and went up one pair of Stairs , and then called to Sally , ( the Deceased 's Daughter ) and told her he would have this Cane : She said it had done Mischief enough already , and therefore it was put out of the way . Ye little Bitch , says he , I will knock your Brains out if you speak another Word . Thereupon the Deceased got out of Bed and went down and I went with a Candle , but my Candle was knocked out , and a Blow was given . And just as the Deceased 's Wife came with another Candle , the Prisoner , lifted up this Broomstick , which he held in both his Hands thus , and was going to strike the Deceased another Blow . Ye Villain , said I , will you strike the poor old Man again , and with that I went to catch hold of the Broomstick , and received such a Blow on my Arm , that I carried the Mark of it for two Weeks . Here is the Broomstick , and here you may see the Blood upon it still . Sarah Purser , the Widow of the Deceased . The Prisoner came in with a little piece of Candle in his Fingers . I was then going up , and he going up too , would have taken the Wall of me , which I refusing he called me Names : when he got to the Stair 's Head , he and my Daughter had some Words : Ye tallow Face Bitch , says he , do you chatter ? I will knock your Brains out . I heard my Husband get out of Bed , and open his Chamber Door . I went up soon after , and found him all in a gore of Blood , upon which I struck the Prisoner with a fire Shovel , and then I got my Husband to bed . He was lame , and sixty three Years of Age . Next Morning , which was Tuesday , he went before Justice Chamberlain , who bound the Prisoner over for an Assault , we not then thinking the Wound was mortal . On Wednesday , about five in the Morning , my Husband went to his Work , ( he was a Weaver by Trade ) but he returned and complained of such a violent Pain in his Head , where the Wound was , that if he could not get safe , he should run mad . On Thursday I had Mr. Fremoult the Surgeon , who said , he believed the Wound was not mortal , and so advised me to get him some Sage Tea , and to lay on a Blister . But from that time , my Husband frequently clapped his Hand to his Head and cryed , Sarah , for God 's sake knock my Brains out . Sarah Purser the Deceased 's Daughter . The Prisoner came in with a bit of Candle , he wanted to take the Wall of my Mother , she refused , he called her Bitch and went up , and then called her a great many Bitches : Ye are an old Rogue , says I , to call my Mother Bitch . Ye little Tallow Fac 'd Bitch , says he , if you chatter , I will knock your Brains out . My Father coming out at his Door , the Prisoner cryed , come out you old Rogue , for I am ready for ye . Hearing this , I desired Mr. Darby to go up , which he did , and in a little time I followed him , and saw my Father all bloody . Isaac Batson . Going cross the Yard , I heard a Cry of Help for God 's sake ! Murder . I run up , and then found the Deceased and Prisoner both bloody , and the Deceased had got hold of one end of the Prisoner 's Stick , and the Prisoner had hold of the other end , but I got it from the Prisoner . Mr. Hall . Three Months before this last Accident , hearing Murder cry 'd in the Deceased 's Room , I run in and saw the Prisoner striking him on the Head with this Cane , and the Deceased then standing by a Window which he leaned on ( for without something to lean on he could not stand ) he gave the Prisoner a Blow on the Hand with his Crutch , and wounded his Finger . I asked the Prisoner what he meant by abusing the old Man . Damn him an old son of a Bitch , says he , I will murder him . Prisoner I was going up with a bit of Candle , but this Woman and her Daughter crouded up the Stairs so that I could hardly get along . I think you are bewitched , says I , to stop the Passage up . Upon that the Mother and Daughter began to call me rotten old Dog , and stinking Rogue , and so I swore at the Girl , and said , Ye little Toad I will knock your Brains out . Then the Deceased came to the Stair 's Head , and said , Whose Brains will you knock out ? Your insolent Daughter 's , says I , and with that he up with his Crutch and broke my Head - He had served me so twice before - I did not strike him with the Broom Stick , but with my Cane , and then his Daughter fell on me with a Candle-stick , and his Wife with a Fire-shovel . Joseph Darby , again . I went up , and the Prisoner put the Candle out before any Blow was struck . and in two Minutes another Candle was brought ; the Deceased was then bloody , but the Prisoner was not , and there was Blood on the Prisoner 's Broomstick , but none on his Cane . The Jury found him Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 85. Charles Macdonagh , alias Macdaniel , was indicted last Sessions with Thomas Mac Cray since executed ) and Peter Senhouse ( not then taken ) for stealing a Promissory Note , dated November 16 , 1734 , for sixty five Pounds , payable three Months after Date , the Property of Andrew Boyle , May the twenty eighth . Andrew Boyle . I had a Note dated November 16 , 1734 , for sixty five Pound , indors 'd to John George , and John George indors 'd it to me . I wanted to have it discounted , and spoke to two or three of my Acquaintance , but they refused : at last one Lawler told me he knew a Man that would do it . So we went at five in the Evening to meet this Man at the Hare and Hound in Peter Street near Clare Market . At seven one Geheogan an Attorney came and took the Heads of the Note . and my Name Andrew Boyle , Taylor in Drury Lane , and then said he knew two Men who discounted Notes , but one of them never lent less than one hundred Pound , and the other no more than fifty . However he would try what he could do with them , and then appointed me to come to the same House at five the next Evening . I went accordingly , and met Lawler , who told me the Mony was ready , and so took me to the Thatched House in Butcher 's Lane , where I saw O Brian an Attorney sitting by the Fire . Presently in came Mac Cray and the Prisoner . I had never seen Mac Cray but once before , and that was by accidentally being at a House where he was drinking . He was O Brian 's Clerk . As soon as he came in , he took me by the Hand , and was so mighty glad to see me that nothing could be like it . He pulled out a handful of Gold and Silver , and asked me if I wanted any Mony . I told him I only wanted a Note of sixty five Pounds to be discounted . O says he , I will do that for you in five Minutes . So he took me to the Door , and called a Coach , and he and I and the Prisoner went in , and Mac Cray bid the Coachman drive to Mr. Heath 's , a Tavern in Spring Garden . When we came there , he asked who was in the Parlor . He was answered , Mr. Heath with some Company . Then we went up Stairs , where they shewed me some Pictures to amuse me , and said , why do you keep Company with such low lifed Fellows ? See what a House we bring ye to ! In a little time the Drawer came and said there was now Room in the Back Parlor . So we went in there , and they told me Heath should discount the Note . Heath came in and talked of Horse Races and went out again . We knocked , and Peter Senhouse the Drawer came . I gave the Note to Mac Cray , who gave it to Senhouse . They brought Pen and Ink and bid me indorse it , which I did . Mac Cray asked me if any body thereabouts knew the Hands of the other Indorsers . I said , yes , a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood . Mac Cray took the Note , and said he would go and enquire . He went out , and coming back he told the Prisoner that the Gentleman 's Footmen were sawcy Fellows . Upon which the Prisoner pretended to be in a violent Passion , snatched the Note out of my Hand in a hurry , and said , D - the insolent Rascals ! I will have them turned out of their Places . And then he went out , and returning to me he said the Note was very good and I should have my Mony in two or three Days . I insisted upon having my Note again , but the Prisoner went away . Mac Cray turned me out at the Back Door , and carried me to the George Tavern in Spring Gardens , and from thence he took me in a Coach a second time to Florence Maccartey 's , at the Hare and Hound in Peter Street , and from thence to Mr. Mac Kelly 's at the King 's Arms Tavern in Wild Street . Prisoner . It 's surprising you should go to all these Places , and not complain to any of the Company where you went . Boyle . I knew not what to do , nor how to get my Note again , and then I had been drinking . We had Punch at Heath 's , where Mac Cray filled me brimming Glasses , and swore by G - I should drink them off . And at the George Tavern we had a Pint of Wine . So that I was drunk when I came the second time to the Hound and Hare . And besides , Mac Cray all along amused me with one pretence or other , and told me if I would but be easy and meet him the next Morning , I should certainly have the Mony . But instead of that , I have been sued for this Note ; I have had thirty seven Actions brought against me on account of this Note , and another which was forged for forty eight Pound . It has cost me above two hundred Pound , and has been the ruin of me . Florence Maccartey . On the twenty eighth of November last , between nine and ten at Night , the Prosecutor and Mac Cray came to my House by Clare Market in a Coach . The Prosecutor was drunk , and Mac Cray would have some Punch . I refused to let him , but he would have an eighteen-penny Tiff , and so at last I made it . When that was out he would have had another , but I was resolved to make no more . They staid about two Hours , and at going away , I advised Mac Cray to take care of his Friend the Prosecutor , and see him safe Home . No , says Mac Cray , I will make a hundred Pounds of him before to-morrow Morning . Mr. Kelly . Between eleven and twelve at Night , the Prosecutor and Mac Cray knocked at my Door , the King 's Arms in Wild Street , and wanted a Bottle of Wine . I told the Prosecutor he was drunk and had better go home . However , they came in , and then I went to Bed - I think Mac Cray was not drunk . Mr. Kelly 's Drawer . They had a Bottle of Wine , and then called for the Reckoning ; the Prosecutor put his Hand in his Pocket , and said , By G - I have no Money , and then Mac Cray gave a six and thirty Shilling Piece to change . Mr. Clendon . I have heard the Prisoner say that he never had but twenty Pound for the Note , and that was from one Wreathock an Attorney in Hatton Garden . The Prisoner 's Defence . Thomas Heath , I keep the Wine Cellar under the Chappel in Spring Gardens , but I live in a House next Door . Gray ( Mac Cray ) brought Boyle to me to have a Note discounted , but I could not do it , and so Boyle had his Note again . Prisoner . Was not Boyle at your House the next Day ? Boyle . Yes , I was there , and they made me pay Four Shillings for my Dinner , though I was so vext that I could hardly eat any thing . I saw the Prisoner there , and I asked him for my Note or the Money , but he said Mac Cray had got the Note . I staid there till the Evening , and then Mr. Heath told us that Mac Cray and the Prisoner were two notorious Rogues , and vile Villains . Heath . I did not say vile Villains , for I do not love Law Suits ; but being told that the Note was not taken away , but that it was given to be discounted , I thereupon said , they were got into bad Hands - Meaning Mac Cray and the Prisoner ? Heath . No , meaning only Mac Cray , for Boyle said that Tom Gray ( Mac Cray ) had got the Note . Boyle . I said no such thing . William Bowyer . I went to Mr. Heath 's about eleven in the Morning , and there I saw Boyle , and afterwards the Prisoner came down , and Boyle told him that he waited for Mac Cray to whom he had given a Note the last Night . But he did not say a Syllable of the Prisoner 's having the Note . Boyle . I am positive that this Man was not there , for there was no such Person in the Company , and I never saw this Man before Yesterday . Heath . Bowyer was there , and drank with Boyle , and they afterwards dined together with other Company . Heath and Bower were put out of Court - Now Boyle , what had you for Dinner that Day ? Boyle . A Leg of Mutton boil 'd , but it was half raw , and when the out-side was cut off , we broil 'd some of the rest . How many might there be in Company ? Boyle . Five or six . It was but a little Room , and they pretty well filled it . I scolded and made a Noise about my Note , and there was one Bradshaw a lusty Man , who said if I would give them an eighteen-penny Tiff of Punch , they would help me to my Note again - The Prisoner came in about two of the Clock , and I insisted upon his giving me the Note , but he said Mac Cray had it . Now call in Bowyer - Here Bowyer ! What had you for Dinner that Day ? Bowyer . I can not say what ; for I dined there two or three Days in a Weeks , and this was four or five Months ago . We pay nothing for eating , but each Man pays for a Bottle of Wine . - What Day of the Week or Month was it ? Bowyer . I can not pretend to remember the Day , nor what Discourse happened . - Not remember what Discourse ? And yet you have been very particular as to what Boyle said . Bowyer . I am sure of this , that he did not speak to the Prisoner . - You swore otherwise just now . Bowyer . But I mean he did not say a Word to him as to charging him with having the Note . - What is the Prisoner 's Character ? Bowyer . I never heard any harm of him , but that he was a Split-cause Lawyer . - Call in Heath - Do you remember what you had for Dinner that Day ? Heath . I can not say that I do . - Or what Day of the Week or Month it was ? Heath . No , for I do not set down a Minute of every thing . Joseph Osgood . I have heard both Bowyer and Heath say , that three were not two greater Rogues living than Mac Cray and the Prisoner . Prisoner . Pray ask him if he has not had Malice prepense against me for these three Years ? Osgood . No other than what I have had to any other Person of such a Character - I had no private personal Malice . Prisoner . He and I have Horse-whipped one another , and I threw Water in his Face . Osgood . Mac Cray indicted two innocent Women for a Robbery * I was concerned on their part , though what I did , was at my own Expence , I went to a House where the Prisoner and one Driscol where , to give notice for Mac Cray to attend the Tryal . The Prisoner and Driscol quarrelling , the Prisoner threw Water at him , and part of it fell on me . * Margaret and Hester Hobbs , who were tried in December last . Sessions Paper Number 1 . Page 16 . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 86. William Phillips . alias Clark , was indicted for stealing a grey Gelding , value fifteen Pound , the Property of John Winter , August 19 . John Winter . I came with my Coach from Tunbridge , on Tuesday the nineteenth of August , and came over London Bridge about seven at Night . I had ryed this Horse behind the Coach with two Ropes , and between Cannonstreet and Watlingstreet , a Boy called to me , and said , a Man had cut the Horse loose and rid off . I got down and went in pursuit of the Man , as far as Cheapside , but not finding him , I returned . The Boy told me his own Name , and where he lived . I advertised the Horse , and dispersed a hundred printed Bills among the Inn-keepers . Going afterwards to the Talbot Inn my Landlord told me that such a Horse as mine , was left at Mr Havards , at the White Horse in little Wild Street . I went thither , and found the Horse to be mine . I advised the Landlord to stop the Person who came for the Horse . And accordingly the Prisoner was taken the next Evening . James Howard . The Woman that keeps the Swan and Horse-shoe , in great Wild street came for the Horse . So I spoke to a Constable , to attend at a little Distance , and then I went with the Horse to the Swan and Horseshoe , where I found the Prisoner , and gave him my Bill , which came to ten Shillings for eight Nights : He said his Name was Phillips , and bid me write a Receipt , which I did , and he paid me , and was going to take the Horse ; but seeing the Constable , he run out at the back Door , we cryed out stop Thief , and he was taken by a Soldier . Benjamin Scotney , a Soldier , I seized the Prisoner by the Collar : He had a Cutlace in one Hand , and a Pistol in the other , he struck at me with his Cutlace and cut off the end of my Finger , and then flashed his Pistol , but it did not go off . This was confirmed by the Constable . Thomas Leach , a Boy sixteen Years old . My Master sent me from the Burrough to carry a pair of Breeches into the Strand . I got behind this Coach upon the Bridge . The Prisoner came and stroaked the Horse under the Belly , and then went off towards the Houses , and so he did several times , and at last asked me if that was my Master 's Horse , I said no . I got down by Dutton Stone , and followed the Coach , and then I saw the Prisoner get on the Horse 's back . I asked him what he was going to do ; he called me Names , and then I see him lean forward with something bright in his Hand , and presently the Horse was loose , and he rid away full speed the contrary way the Coach was going : I saw him by the light of the Lamps . I called to the Coachman a good while before I could make him stop - I went to see the Prisoner in the Gate-house , where he was sitting with seven or eight more , and as soon as he went out , I said that was the Man . Prisoner , There were but two besides me and the Justice , and I was in Fetters . John Winter . There was the Justice and two more , and I and my Brother , and the Prisoner . Prisoner . But you and your Brother went in with the Boy . Winter 's Brother . We did but the Boy did not know me . Silver Crispin . I was at the taking of the Prisoner , and saw him snap the Pistol at the Soldier . I searched him and found another Pistol in his Pocket , and when he came before the Justice , hearing that he was one of Mac Cray 's Accomplices , I searched him again , and felt something soft without side ; but before I could get at it , he had removed it , and I found in the place where he sat , this Crape and three Bullets wrapt up in a piece of Paper . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . I can prove that I was at home when the Horse was stole . John Morgan . I am a Taylor , and worked : for the Prisoner all that Week , that the Men were hanged at Kennington , except the Day they were hanged , which was Thursday , for then I made a Holiday , to see the Execution . We had a Roquelaur to make for Dr. Harris , and on Tuesday Morning the Doctor called to see if it was done . Dr. Harris . I called there one Mornnig , but the Prisoner was not there then . Morgan . Very true , my Master was out that Morning , but my Master came home about three in the Afternoon , and I told him the Doctor had been there , and wanted his Roquelaur , and thereupon my Master sat down himself , to help finish it : And he worked with us till nine a Clock at Night . Hugh Hart , another Taylor , deposed to the same purpose . Mary Gibson . The Prisoner employed a great many Men , and behaved himself handsomely , so far as I know - Two of his Men lodged at my House ; and last Tuesday Night was three Weeks , between ten and eleven , I went to see why my Lodgers staid so late , and the Prisoner came to the Door himself , and let me in - I remember it was Tuesday , because the next Day , we heard the Prisoners had attempted to break out of the New Goal . Laurence Benson . On the Tuesday before the Men were hanged at Kennington , four Men came to my Mistresses House , the Swan and Horseshoe Tavern in Wildstreet , about ten at Night ; one of them had a Horse , which he twisted to the Post as the Door , they had two three Shilling Bowls of Punch . When they were going they asked for a Porter to carry the Horse to a Stable . A Porter came , and I sent him with the Horse to the Black Horse in Little Wild Street . On the Friday following they came again , and the Prisoner came in at the same time . They sat down together , and called for a Pen and Ink , and I heard one of them say , a Guinea and a half , and the Prisoner answered , I will give a Guinea . And then I went to fetch the Horse . Prisoner . I happened to be drinking at that House , and these Men were talking about a Horse , and I wanting to hire a Horse for a Month , I bid them a Guinea , and asked the Girl where the Horse was . Constable . The Girl is a common Street-walker , she does not live at a Tavern , but a Brandy-shop . John Winter . It was not she that came for the Horse , but her Mistress ; and my House is not the Black Horse but the White Horse . Then the Prisoner called several to his Character . They deposed that he behaved civilly in the Neighbourhood , and they had no Suspicion of him till the time Mac Cray came to lodge with him . After which , it was reported that he used to ride out , and he had been seen coming home booted and spurred between one and two in the Morning . Prisoner . It is hard I should suffer because Mac Cray happened to lodge in my House , and because I worked for him . As for my having Arms , I was going into the Country to receive fourteen Pound . And as for my running away from the Constable , I thought he had been a Bailiff , and I being in debt , was afraid of being arrested . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 87 , 88. Mary Holmes , was indicted with Elizabeth Jenkins , not yet taken , for stealing a Blanket , a Towel a Box-Iron , and two Heaters , the Goods of George Salmon , November 9 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 89. James Tomlinson , was indicted for stealing a Silver Pint Mug , the Goods of Francis Waters , July 4 . The Prisoner had been drinking at the Prosecutor 's House , and after he was gone , the Mug was mist . But it appearing that he was a Man of a very good Character , the Jury acquitted him . 90. Edward Birch , was indicted for assaulting Ann Gowen on the Highway , and robbing her of eight Shillings , July 10 . Ann Gowen . I had parted with my Friend , and was going home about three o'Clock in the Morning , when the Prisoner took hold of me at the Corner of Russel Street by Drury Lane , and said , Ye Bitch , give me a Dram of Mexico . I told him I had not a Half-penny in the World , or else I would . Ye lye , ye Bitch , says he , You have been smaxing the Cole . I asked him what he meant by that . He said he would soon make me know what he meant , and so he laid fast hold on me , and put his Hand in my Pocket and took out eight Shillings and a Knife and a pair of Garters . He slung the Garters at me , upon which I looked hard at him and then I knew him , whereof I says to him , I beg you will take this Knife and grind it , and I will call for it to morrow . So I went home to my Landlady , and told her I was quite undone , for the Man that kept the Grinder 's Shop in Clare Market , had robbed me . Well says she , be easy may be the Man was in Liquor , and he will give it you again . So I went to his House , but he used me very grosly , and threatned to send me over the Water . Juryman . How came you to be out so late ? Ann Gowen . I had been taking leave of my Brother , and he see me most of my way home and left me at the end of Princes street - I went to the Prisoner again , and told him I had got a Warrant , and would certainly serve it , if he did not give me my Money : I kept the Warrant two Days , and then I took him in his own Shop . - Did you cry out when you were rob 'd ? A. Gowen . No , for I saw nobody to Subsist me . But there was another Man stood by the Prisoner when he robbed me ; and he said to the Prisoner : If you do not give her the Money again , we are undone , for she knows ye . - Did you ever offer four or five Guineas to any one to assist you in this Prosecution ? A. Gowen . No . Prisoner . Have you never been in Bridewell ? A. Gowen . Never but three times . I was an unfortunate Woman , and was drawn away by a Man , that I lived with four Years , and then I rioted him , and so I was sent to Bridewell the first time : Then I got a Cut on my Arm , and so I was sent the second time : And the third time was , when a Gentleman said , I had been vile with a Man . Mary Frost . I keep a little shed at the corner of Covent Garden , and sell small Beer and Coffee , and a Dram for the Market People . I go to Bed at nine or ten , and get up at two or three - And to about three o'Clock this Nan Gowen came to me crying , and said , her Friend had given her a small parcel of Mony , and a Man had taken it from her , but she knew where he lived . I bid her go and see if he would not return it ; and she went , but came back again , and said , he bid her be gone about her business . So at last he was carried before a Justice , and while we were at the Justice 's House , but before we went into the Room where the Justice was , I heard her say to the Prisoner , Are not you the Man that took my Money ? And he answered , Yes , I am , and I own it was a great Fault . My Husband and this Man heard the same . Then when we went in before the Justice , she charged him with robbing her , but he denied it . - Did you tell the Justice that he had owned it in your hearing ? M. Frost . No . - How happened that ? M. Frost . Neither I nor my Husband went in with them before the Justice . - How then do you know what he or she said before the Justice ? M. Frost . Why at first we all went in , and she said to the Justice this is the Man , and then the Prisoner took her aside , and said , For God 's Sake my Dear make it up . And she said , are not you the Man that took my Mony ? And he answered , Yes , and I am sorry for it . And I begged of her for Christ 's Sake not to swear it upon the poor Man , if she was not very sure that he was the Person . - It seems she was very willing to have made it up before , therefore how came it about that she did not agree to it when he offer 'd it ? M. Frost . Why the Justice called out and said , What ? Are you going to compound Felony in my Presence ? And so they went in again the second time , and it was then that I went away . - Do you consider that you are upon your Oath , and that the Man 's Life is at Stake ? M. Frost . His Life ! God forbid it should touch his Life ! if I thought so I should never forgive my self . Juryman . Did Gowen lodge in your House ? M. Frost . Not before the Prosecution . Juryman . What is her Character ? M. Frost . A Woman of the Town - I will not wrong my Conscience . Wiliam Frost . I went with them before the Justice . The Prisoner pulled me out of the Justice 's Hall into the Passage next the Street , and begged of me to persuade her not to prosecute . - Where was the Constable then ? W. Frost . In the Hall with the Justice . - Who had the Prisoner in Custody ? W. Frost . The Maid stood at the Door . - What did both the Justice and Constable take no more care of a Man who was charged with a Robbery ? Did Ann Gowen say any thing to the Prisoner , or he to her in the Entry ? W. Frost No , this was all that was said while I was there . He brought two Men , one Mr. Izzard , and John Uffard to speak in his praise , but the Justice turned Uffard out of Doors . Juryman . Did this Woman lodge in your House ? W. Frost . Yes , she had lodged in my Cave about a Fortnight before this happened , but she made her Bed on the hard Boards . Juryman . What 's her Character ? W. Frost . I have heard she has been in Bridewell , and she goes for a loose Woman , that 's all . As the Prisoner was going to the Gate-house , he took me aside , and said , I will make you satisfaction if you will get her to go into the Country , and not prosecute , for it would not vex me , but that she is such a Vagabond . The Prisoner 's Defence . William Cross , Senior . On Friday was sen-night , I asked Ann Gowen if she proceeded against the Prisoner . Yes , by G - will I , says she . I asked her if she had got any Witnesses ; she said she had five , William Frost and his Wife , and Wills the Brandy Man , Beard the Constable , and a Woman ; and if I would come in , she would tip me four or five Guineas . I told her if she had five Witnesses already , there would be no need of me . But she said she wanted one thing to be sworn - that I should give her the Character of an honest pains taking Woman , and that I saw her Brother give her eight Shillings , and saw the Prisoner rob her of it . And if you will but do this , says she , when we have got the Reward we will snack the Cole between us , and bite all the rest - I have known her two Years to be a loose Vagabond , and I believe she was never Mistress of eight Shillings , without she picked a Man 's Pocket for it . Alice Cross , and William Cross , Junior , deposed to the same effect . Ann Gowen . I have another Witness - Edward Wall - pray call Edward Wall . Edward Wall . I know Ann Gowen to be a vile common Woman - She and Frost fell out lately about a Bit of Salmon . Gowen threw the Salmon down , and said , D - your Blood ! I wo n't be kept under any longer , for by G - I half damn 'd my Soul for you already , in swearing that I had the Mony of my Brother , when D - me I had it of a Cull - They often quarrelled about the Reward . Frost had trusted her four or five Pound , and said he should be undone if the Reward was lost - She told me she had got a Friend that would swear any thing , that his Name was William Cross , and that I and William Frost should go and talk with him . So we went , but she went up first by her self , and when she came down , Frost and I went up , and I asked Cross , if he had any thing to say . He told me that what he had to say , he would say before a Judge . When we came down again , Frost said to me . I do n't much like this Man . O says , Nan Gowen , we have laid the Scheme between us . He is to swear that he came to the Queen 's Head in Baldwin 's Gardens , and there he saw me and a young Man ; and that he said to me , How do you do Mrs. Hunter ; who is this Man that is so much like you ? Is it your Brother ? and that I said , Yes : And that then he saw my Brother give me eight Shillings . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . The Court ordered Ann Gowen , William Frost and his Wife to be taken into Custody for Perjury . 91.

On the tenth of July between eleven and twelve at Night , as I was going home , towards Uxbridge , in the Road , hard by Windmill Lane in Norwood Parish , I saw the Prisoner and William Davis on the other side of the Road . They asked who was there . I answered , Here is one , and I had no sooner spoke , than they bid me stand . I told them I was but a poor old Man . But the Prisoner pulled out a Pistol , and said , Deliver your Money , or you are a dead Man . So they took eight Shillings from me ; and I went and told my Family how I had been robbed . I did not know them Men when I saw them first , but I knew them both before they left me . I knew the Prisoner was a Glazier , and where he lived . And so on Sunday Morning I sent four Men to lay hold on them . The Prisoner 's Defence . Mrs. Scot . Moses Ditch and another came to my House , and enquired if my Husband was Headborough . I asked them what they wanted . They said they were going to take the Prisoner for robbing the old Cobler at Hanwell . As the Prisoner bore an honest Character , I gave him notice of this ; but said , as he knew himself to be innocent , he had no occasion to keep out of the way . Mr. Loveday . I keep the Golden Lyon at Kew Green . The Prisoner worked at Haymaking for Mr. Downs . On the tenth of July he came home at six in the Evening , sat up 'till past ten , and then went to bed , and another Man lay with him . Thomas Jones . I was in Company with him at Mr. Loveday 's from six to past ten , and then went to bed with him , and he was not out of the House all night . I believe him to be a very honest labouring Man . And William Davis , who was taken on the same Account , and is since dead in Newgate , had likewise the same Character . Robert Palmer . I lodge at Loveday 's . The Prisoner was there in my Company from six to half an Hour past ten , and then he went to bed . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 101 , 102. James Farrel and Charles Hooper , were indicted for assaulting John Wood , in a Field near the Highway , and robbing him of a Hat and Wig , a pair of Shoe Buckles , and a Knee Buckle , July 8 . John Wood . On Tuesday the eighth of July between three and four in the Morning , I was walking behind White Chappel Mount when Farrel ( who was then in a Red Wastecoat ) clapt something to my Breast , and bid me stand , and then he pulled a Crape over his Face , but I saw his Face first . There were two others with him , but their Faces were covered as soon as I saw them . Then one of those two took my Hat and Wig , and the Prisoner searched my Pockets , but finding no Money , he said , D - ye , you Dog , I have a good mind to knock your Brains out , and then took the Buckles out of my Shoes , and one of my Knee Buckles - One of the Men flash 'd a Pistol . On Friday I went to Newgate , where the Prisoners were turned loose among others , and I fixt upon Farrel , but could not be so positive to the other , because I had not seen his Face before . Edward Lawrence , Constable . Justice Lade gave me orders if I saw any loose Fellows there , to bring them before him . I knew Hooper had been in Bridewell , and on the eighth or ninth of July , about six in the Morning , being told that he and two others were seen in Mint Street with Pistols , and some Pewter Plates , I went and found them , the two Prisoners and Thomas Baugh , coming out of an Alley : I told Hooper that I had a Warrant against him for beating a Woman ; by this Pretence , I got him and his two Companions , who followed him , to my House . I found a Pistol on one of them . Baugh confessed and told me , that Farrel had got the Buckles in his Pocket . As I was going with the Prisoners before Sir John Lade , Baugh being left behind , One of them said , What does Baugh stay for ? Another answered , to be made a Puff , what do you think he stays for else . - Baugh made an Information of this , and six or seven other Robberies . Thomas Baugh . About eleven o'Clock on Monday Night , the Prisoners and I went into the Fields to rob . We walked about , 'till two the next Morning , and met nobody , and so we sat down under White Chappel Mount , until Day break , and then we saw the Prosecutor , with a Woman , upon which Farrel said , let us go up - Here is a Chance - You are not afraid Tom ? And then he gave me a Pistol : Hooper stepped up to the Prosecutor first , and clapped a Pistol to his Mouth , and swore G - D - your Blood , I will blow your Brains out . Hooper was in a light grey Coat , and a brown Frock and a white Waistcoat . Farrel had a Red Soldier 's Wastcoat ( for he belongs to the third Regiment ) but he had pulled the Lace off : He searched the Prosecutor , and took his Buckles , which were afterwards found upon him , and I took the Prosecutor 's Hat and Wig . Prosecutor . I never saw the Woman , he speaks of , until they came up to me , and then she stood still , and I wondered they did not rob her . As to the Man , who was then in the white Wastecoat , it was not he that came up to me first and bid me deliver ; but it was Farrel , who was then in a Red Wastecoat , and the other had a Snuff coloured Coat . Baugh .

On Sunday the thirty first of August , at a Quarter past eight in the Morning , I went down to give my Cat some Victuals , but she flew down into the Cellar , and I followed her , and hearing a Noise in the Vault , I thought she was fallen in there , for I once had a Cat that met with such a mischance . I got a Candle , and looking down I saw something wabbling about , which I thought was the Cat . But my Wife coming down for some Coals , the Cat came and fondled about her , at which she screamed out and said , It is not the Cat in the Vault - I got a piece of an Iron Hoop , which I tyed to a String and put it down , and by moving it about I discovered part of a Child - We got Assistance , and broke up the Vault , put down a Ladder , and a Boy went down and brought up a Child alive ; but it died at about five the same Day - I found a Stick in the Vault about seven or eight Foot long .

I got up from my Husband and went down to the Vault , where my Senses went from me , and I did not recover my self , nor know what I did or said - I was under no Temptation of being so barbarous , for I had a good Husband who was able to maintain the Child ; and I had at the same time one Child living of four Years old . Phebe Webster . When I first went up she lay upon the Bed and I helped her into bed , and it was two Hours afterwards that I asked her how she could be so barbarous : and she answered , because she was wicked - She indeed was very weak and faint as I thought .

On the twenty ninth of May , in the Evening , as my Husband was drawing a Dram for Mr. Morley , and I was sitting at the end of the Counter , looking through the Window . The Prisoner 's Wife run by , and he followed her . My Dear says I , There is Sam running after his Wife , to beat her : I wish you would speak to him . So my Husband went out and desired him not to beat his Wife . The Prisoner ( as my Husband afterwards told me ) said , G - D - your Blood , though you are a Constable , you have got no Warrant for me . The Deceased answered , No Sam , and if I had I would sooner let you know of it , than serve it upon ye . The Prisoner D - 'd his Blood again and having a Pipkin in his Hand , with Eggs in it , he upped with this Pipkin , and knocked the Deceased down in the Kennel : I helped to take him up . The Wound was at the Corner of his Eye , and the Grissle of his Nose was broke , he bled near three Hours . I sent for Mr. Meadows a Surgeon , who , after trying several things to stop it , was forced to bleed him in the Arm , and that turned the Blood . The Prisoner came into the Shop , my Husband said to him Sam , I did not think that you of all Men would have served me The Prisoner d - 'd his Blood , and said , If I had killed my Wife I had not cared , for I could but have been hanged for her . This was done on Thursday and my Husband died on the Saturday sennight following - And he said two or three times the Day before he died that the Wound was the cause of his death . John Morley . Going up Old Gravel Lane about ten o'Clock . I found my self ill , and called at the Deceased 's Shop for a Glass of Anniseed . He drew it , and I sat down . The Prisoner and his Wife quarrelled . He wanted her to dress his Supper , which she refused , and would not go home with him . Ye Son of a B - , says she , Because you have brought home so much Money you want a hot Supper and be d - 'd to you . He begun to pull her violently to make her come home , and she struggled hard not to go upon which the Deceased stept between them in a friendly manner , and said , Sam do n't beat your Wife . The Prisoner returned . If you are a Constable , you have no Warrant against me . No says the Deceas 'd , And if I had I 'd sooner let you know it than serve it upon you . And then I think he took hold of the Prisoner 's right Arm . but in a gentle friendly manner . D - ye , say , the Prisoner , You have no business between me and my Wife ; and then having a Pint Pipkin with two or three Eggs in it , in his Hand he lifted his Hand up , and with the Pipkin he struck the Deceased a Blow just by the left Eye ; but whether he threw the Pipkin , or held it in his Hand when the Blow was given , I can not say , but the Pipkin was broke and the Deceased fell in the Kennel . I stepped from the Door where I then stood to help him up . But he being a heavy Man , I called his Wife to assist me . I called three times before she came , for she was then in a little Room backward , and saw nothing of the Affair . We brought him into the Shop , and she sent me for a Surgeon ; after which the Prisoner came in and said , If you had kept in your Shop this had not happened - It is done and I can not help it - I am sorry for it , but if I had killed my Wife I had not cared , for I could but have been hanged for her Alice Collins , the Deceased 's Servant . My Master was carried up Stairs for dead . I sat up with him , and towards the Morning he came to himself . He got up in the Morning for two or three Hours , but was forced to go to bed again . He afterwards languished about the House , but was not capable of doing any Business . He declared on his Death Bed , that if he died , it would be by the Wound Sam Hutchins had given him . Peter Ken . I went to visit the Deceas 'd in his Illness . He was in a Dose , and his Wife said to him , Low ! Low ! Do you think that Hutchins has been the Cause of your Death . He answered , Yes , but spoke as if the Words were pulled out of his Mouth - He used to be troubled with Fits , so that once he bit his Tongue almost in two . Thomas Hood . The Day before he died , he said , he was afraid he should never do well in this World for the Blow that Hutchins had given him would be his Death . I told him I hoped not . He replied that he was satisfied it would be his end , and there was no possibility of the contrary . I was with him when the Surgeon bled him , and then I and the Surgeon 's Man carried him up in a Chair like a dead Man . I saw him in his Shop three Days after , I asked him how he did . He told me Hutchins was just gone by , and says he , I ask 'd him how he could serve me so ill , and he answered , D - ye , if I had killed ye , I should have been glad of it , for you had no business to meddle with me at that time . Prisoner . My Wife and I had some Words , and she run out . I followed her with a Pipkin in my Hand to bring her back ; upon which the Deceased came and took hold of my Shoulder , and it being dark . I tost the Pipkin out of my Hand , but did not strike him with it . Alice Richmond . About a Month before the Blow , I saw the Prisoner in his Shop , and he said he that he was very ill , and he believed he and I strove who should die first , for he had something on his Heart that he could not remove . Hains Brasier . I saw him five Weeks before the Blow , and he said he was not well , nor he believed never should ; and then he shewed me his Tongue which he had bit through in several places when he was in Fits ; but says he , I was never subject to these Fits before I was cast in this Law suit . I have lain it to heart , and I believe it will be my Death John Brick . I have known the Prisoner twenty Years , he was an honest industrious Man , and not given to quarrelling . William Thompson , Surgeon . Four Days after the Deceased 's death , I viewed his Body , he had a Wound on the left side of his Nose , there was no Fracture of the Bone , but the Cartlage or Grissel of the Nose was separated from the Bone by the Violence of the Stroke . I opened the Head , I found no Fracture in the Cranium , nor any extravasated Blood , nor visible Cause of his Death from that Wound . Indeed I have heard he lost a vast Quantity of Blood . The violent Contusion made by the Blow might cause that extraordinary Effusion of Blood at the Nose , and this might cause the subsequent Convulsion Fit , to be more violent , which might carry him off . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 125.
