As to the Pocket-Book , he said it was not put up after the Health was writ in it . Then the Prisoner brought several Witnesses , who gave the Prosecutor but an indifferent Character ; and a great many of very good Credit to his own Reputation , who said he was a Butcher , but had left off his Trade , and liv 'd upon what he had .

Another Witness was one Mors , who depos 'd , That the Prisoner propos 'd to him that he might get 10000 l. if he would be concern 'd ; and that he did engage in it , saw the Prisoner make the Experiment , and receiv 'd Money at the Bank for him , for which he was to have a third part of the Profit . The Prisoner did not deny the Fact ; but being allow 'd Council , they argu 'd , That Mr. Odam was not a Servant qualify 'd to make out such Bills , unless authoriz 'd by the Corporation-Seal ; That writing with Red Ink on the Inside of the Bill , can not be call 'd an Indorsement ; Nor , if that were an Indorsement , can the Fact be call 'd rasing or altering .
