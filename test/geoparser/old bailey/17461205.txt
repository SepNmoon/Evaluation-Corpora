Edward Vaughan , indicted for privately stealing a Piece of Silk Handkerchiefs out of the Shop of Joseph Starky , value 1 l. 11 s. 6d . the 18th of September . Q. to Joseph Starky . What do you know of the Prisoner ? Starky . This Boy ( the Prisoner ) came into my Shop about Candle-light , and another Boy came presently after him ; they asked for out of the Way Handkerchiefs ; I am often attacked by them . I immediately suspected that they were Thieves . They asked for blue Birds-Eyes Handkerchiefs , which , perhaps , are not to be found in one Shop in fifty . They commonly ask for something that would puzzle our . They staid a little while , then went to the Door ; and I stepped to the Door , upon the Rails I had some Handkerchiefs , and I immediately missed a Piece . One of the Boys being gone , I laid hold of the Prisoner , but he had not the Handkerchiefs . The Prisoner said , he knew nothing of it himself , but the Boy that was with him was whistling in the Street , and he would go after him ; but I said I would secure him . John Ralph . One Thursday I was going by Mr Starky 's Door ; he told me , the Prisoner at the Bar had stolen some Handkerchiefs from him . The Boy cried , I asked him if he had any Money to buy Silk Handkerchiefs ; he said he had not , but the other had , which he had received for his Week 's Work : So he says to me , they are whistling in the Street , if you will go with me , I will take them both . Mr Starky did not know that there were two of them ; so Mr Starky said , he had got him , and he would take Care of him . Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say for yourself ? Prisoner . A Lamp lighter in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields asked me to go with him to buy an Handkerchief . Acquitted . 5. indicted for stealing one Silver Watch , value 42 s. out of the Shop of John Neal . Q. to John Neal . Where is your Shop ? Neal . In Leaden hall-street , my Lord . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Neal . My Lord , I never saw him before he was taken . I missed the Watch the 20th of September , pretty early in the Morning : I had lost the outside Case two Days before . It was a Watch that I had to repair ; after I had repaired the Watch , in the Intrim , on Saturday Morning , the Watch that belonged to the same Case , I missed ; looking at the Window , I saw a Corner of the Glass cut out , where there was about Room to take the Watch out , with which I concluded the Watch was gone by the same Hand that stole the Case . I thought it was not prudent to advertise it directly . I have often observed , when Watches are lost and advertised , without no Questions asked , they are seldom heard of , and I thought it would look like hiding Theft ; for that Reason I determined to wait a-while . I waited ten or twelve Days , when one Mr King , Constable in Bartholomew-lane , called upon me , to know if I had not lost a Watch . He said , if you can go over the Way with me , and drink a Glass , I can tell you something about it . He then told me he had taken up a little Boy , one Mr Lane , and he would make no Scruple to tell the whole Affair . When I came , the little Boy told me he was sorry he had said so much , but he would not say any more . He told me what he had said to Mr King , I might make what Use I would of it , he had said one William Lewin was concerned in stealing a Gold Watch ; and after they had stolen mine , they delivered it to one Mary Clements , and they sold it for a Guinea , and they divided the Money . Then I applied to Mr Gardner ( from whom they had taken the Gold Watch ) first for his right Name , and whether he could give me any Information about it . In a few Days afterwards , Mr Gardner saw the Prisoner go by , and took him : and I do not remember that he pretended , from first to last , to deny it . The next Day we went to the Lord-Mayor , and his Lordship remembered him as soon as he saw him , that it was the same Boy as was before him for Mr Gardner 's Gold Watch , and that was tried the Sessions before last . The Boy turns to me and says , he need not be surprized , I have been tried since that at Kingston Assizes . Upon this my Lord granted a Warrant for Mary Clements ; we went to Mary Clements , and she went along with us to the Man that gave a Guinea for it ; we took the Man , and the Watch was produced , and the Watch is now in Court . The Watch was taken at Alexander Bagnal 's in Rag-fair . Thomas Gardner . The Prisoner at the Bar robbed me of a Gold Watch , and I tried him in this Court ; my Servant told me that the same Boy that had robbed me of my Gold Watch , had robbed Mr Neal of a Silver one . Q . Where did he take your Gold Watch ? Gardner . He took it from my Show-glass . Q . What became of it ? Gardner . I never had it more . The Jury acquitted him . - About three Days after that I heard that Mr Neal was robbed , I saw the Prisoner go by with two others . I took him at the Pastry-cook 's buying some Tarts : I took him Home to my House ; he immediately confessed he was aiding and assisting in taking Mr Neal 's Watch , and told me how he broke the Glass . Q. to Samuel Ridley . What have you to say about this ? Ridley . I saw the Prisoner the 4th Day of October at Silversmiths-Hall , and he owned he was with Mc Lane when he stole the Watch . Court . Then he said Mc Lane stole it . Ridley . Yes , my Lord . Q . Where was he ? Ridley . He was a long with him when he stole the Watch . Q . What Time of the Day was it ? Ridley . He did not mention what Time of the Day it was . Q. to Joseph Johnson . What do you know of this Matter ? Johnson . I am Constable where this Lad was taken up . Mr Gardner sent to me to take the Charge of him . I brought him Home to my House ; while my Back was turned , he jumped out of the one Pair of Stairs Window - I was told he fell upon his Backside - one of the Neighbours run by and took him up , and he was carried before my Lord-Mayor , where he was known to be an old Offender . He offered to be a Witness against many of his Accomplices , but my Lord-Mayor said it would be better for him to be sent abroad . The Prisoner told me , he robbed a Gentleman 's Coach-box , & c. Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 6 , 7. Elizabeth Mitchel and Eleanor Conner , were indicted for stealing a Pair of Worsted Hose , the Goods of Thomas Berry , Nov. 5 . Thomas Berry . The two Prisoners at the Bar , Elizabeth Mitchel and Eleanor Conner came into my Shop , they came to the further End of my Compter , which at that Time was very much tumbled with Goods . I went to reach them a Paper of Stockings , at which Time , I perceived Elizabeth Mitchel to draw up to the End of the Shop , where she had no Business : They were very difficult in respect to Colour ; they said they must have them handsome , and handsome Clocks ; then came in a third Woman , upon which I called down my Spouse , they still remained as difficult as before ; at last I perceived Elizabeth Mitchel to draw off a Pair of Stockings , and conceal them under her Cloak ; and she took up another Pair , and said to Conner , here , Madam , these are a pretty Pair of Stockings , these may do without giving so much Trouble ; with that they made a Courtsey , and went out of my Shop ; I followed them out , and at the End of the Lane , at the Time that I had them in Custody , then they dropped them , for I saw Mitchel take them up . Council for the Prisoner . I am on the Behalf of Eleanor Conner ; Sir , I would ask you whether Mrs Conner was called back ? Berry .

Henry Francis . The Prisoner at the Bar came into my House this Day three Weeks , about nine o'Clock at Night , and he pushed himself into the Bar with Mr Rigby , otherwise I should not have admitted him into the Bar , on the Account of his mean Appearance . After he had been there a little while , Mr Rigby said he must go Home , and left a Shilling to pay the Reckoning : about a Quarter of an Hour afterwards , the Prisoner bid the Gentlemen good Night in the Bar , and took me by the Hand , and bid me good Night ; as he was going not knowing the Stairs , he fell down the Cellar Stairs , I went down to him , and found the Tankard upon him . Q . Did you see him take the Tankard ? Francis . No , my Lord ; but there was some Gentlemen see me take it from him ; he concealed it in his Hand . Court . He could not conceal it , when he tumbled headlong ? Francis . He had it in his Hand when I was under the Stairs . Q . How long was it before , that you had seen the Tankard ? Francis .

I live the very next Door to this Gentleman , the Witness . My Boy heard some-body make a Noise at the Door ; he went down and opened the Door , and the Prisoner asked if Mr Rigby was at Home , the Boy answered yes ; he said , call him down then , then my Boy called me down , as I was coming down Stairs , the Prisoner said , Is not your Name Mr Rigby , says he , I am come to be taken Measure of by you for a Suit of Cloaths ; I said , where do you lodge ? he said , I lodge at the next Door , meaning the Prosecutor 's House ; I said , have you got the Cloth to make the Cloaths ? he said no , but he should have it by nine o'Clock in the Morning ; I said it would be Time enough to measure him then , but he would not let me rest till I had done it ; he said he would send the Cloth to that Gentleman 's at the Tavern , at nine o'Clock in the Morning , but he would not let me rest till I had measured him , and then he would not let me rest unless I would take a Tankard of Beer with him at the next Door , so I went into the Gentleman 's House , and would have sat down in the Kitchen , but he would not sit there , but forced himself into the Bar ; so the Gentlemen were talking about foreign Coin , & c. and he talked with them while we were drinking the Tankard of Beer . I thought it long , it was my Bed-time , and I would go home . I left him in the Bar with the four Gentlemen ; about half an Hour after I was gone to Bed , either this Gentleman came himself , or sent some of his Servants to my Door , and said I had brought a Man there that stole his Tankard . True , I did go in with the Man , but he said he lodged there . I never saw him before he knocked at the Door . I imagined that my Neighbour had sent me a Customer . Elias Falmoth . I was in the House drinking , and saw Mr Francis take the Tankard from under the Prisoner 's Coat . Philip Scriwen . I am a Peruke-maker , my Lord , the Prisoner came into my Shop , my Servant called me up ( I was below Stairs ) ; the Prisoner said he wanted to bespeak a Wig of me . I looked at the Man , and I did not think he was a Person that wanted a Wig . He said he belonged to a Privateer , that he was just come home , and he was going to receive 70 l. behind the Exchange ; but seeing the Man so shabby , and I thought a little in Liquor , I did not regard what he said , but wanted to get rid of him , and looked to see that he should not take any Thing from me . At last he says , I will speak with you ; he said , it is a sad Thing for a Man to be in Distress ; I said it was impossible that he should be in Distress , that was going to receive so much Money so soon . He desired me to lend him a Couple of Shillings ; he pressed me very much , but I let him have nothing . I asked him his Name , and he gave me his Name in Writing , that it was Captain James Brown . To the Prisoner . What do you say for yourself ? Prisoner .

Q. to Mr Webb . Did you see this Mitchel that Night ? Webb . As I was passing Long-Acre , going to Lincoln's-Inn , I did not take it to be past 12 o'Clock .

I had not gone above twenty or thirty Yards , but I met the Prisoner at the Bar come running towards me , ( there was a little Moon ) as soon as he perceived me , he endeavoured to cross the Way to avoid me ; upon which I run up to him , and seized him , and held him ; and in a little Time two of the Watch came up . Q . Did you see any other Person near him ? Webb . No , my Lord , the Watch came up in about ten or twelve Seconds ; and Mr Mitchel , who had told me that he was robbed . He had on neither Hat , Wig , nor Sword , and seemed to have been down in the Dirt . The Moment he came up , we shewed him the Man , and as soon as I could make him understand that he saw the Man , he said that Man had robbed him ; and I asked him whether he would charge the Watch with him , and he said he would . Q . Is that all you know ; had the Prisoner any Sword or Goods with him ? Webb . When he was stopped , Sir , and the Watchman came up , I observed a Hat upon the Prisoner 's Head , that seemed to me to be a very good one ; I ordered the Watchman to take it off , and found a Ticket at the Side of it ; and I desired the Prisoner to give an Account of the Ticket ; while he was doing this , one of the Watchmen picked up a Hat behind the Prisoner , which proved to be Mr Mitchel 's Hat . Court . Very near to him ? Webb .

My Mother sent the Maid for me to fetch me home , but I would not go , but went a Ramble , and got as far as St James 's House . I went into a publick House to make Enquiry after a young Man of my Acquaintance ; the Man told me , he was upon Guard that Day . I went and asked where he was , so we went into a Cellar by St James 's Gate , where I staid some time , and my Friend 's Wife and I came home together ; so coming up Long-acre , this Gentleman he comes after us ; this Gentleman Mitchel shoved us both against the Wall : So I says to him , is not the Street wide enough ? I d - d him , and said , is not the Street wide enough ? So I laid hold of him , he drew his Sword , and I shoved him into the Dirt , and threw his Sword into the Street , and went about my Business , and the Woman she was frightened , and was the first Person that screamed out Watch .

What Condition was he in ? Roza . A little in Liquor , but not much . Walter Honsman . I being at the Playhouse , behind the Scenes , heard a Disturbance , and it was by Mr Mitchel drawing his Sword . - [ This was to prove Mr Mitchel a touchy , quarrelsome Man , but the Witness could not go into the Causes , or the Issue of that Affair , therefore that Assertion availed nothing against the Prosecutor . ] Q. to Walter Honsman .

Elizabeth Bradbury was indicted as an Accessory to the Fact , for receiving one of the Rings , set with Diamond Sparks , being Part of the Goods stolen by Matthew Henderson , November 6 . Council . Please your Lordship , and Gentlemen of Jury , I am of Counsel in the Prosecution , in order to bring to Justice a Man whose Station in Life and Character ought to have taught him better . I shall open this Fact as stated to me . The Prosecutor ( Colonel Dalrymple ) when the Murder was committed upon his Lady , had the Misfortune also to lose a great many valuable Goods , to which his Servant ( Matthew Henderson ) pleaded guilty in this Place . When Henderson was committed to the Gate-house , the Prisoner ( Poulter ) was Turnkey , there was a Box that was ordered to be searched for at the Wife 's Lodgings of the Footman , who has suffered . Poulter ( the Prisoner ) was sent to bring this Box ; when the Box was examined , there was these Things missing that had been lost , the Rings mentioned in the Indictment , and the Pearl Necklace . This Poulter ( the Prisoner ) if our Instructions are true , charged the Colonel with secreting these Goods . It is surprizing , that a Reflection of this Kind should be cast upon the Colonel , when at the same Time this Man had the Goods in his Possession . Gentlemen , he must know ( as he was the Turnkey ) and had the Care of the Prisoner Henderson , he must know these were the Goods of Colonel Dalrymple . Gentlemen , there was Advertisements to get at the Knowledge of these Things , but it lay buried a long Time , till at last they thought there would be no more said about it . We shall produce the Gentleman that bought the Goods of this Man . Council for the Defendant . My Lord , I apprehend , in all these Cases , it is necessary to set forth the literal Words as they are in the former Indictment , otherwise it is charging the Prisoner at the Bar as Accessory of a Felony that might not have been committed . Court . There was the same Things in the first Indictment of Henderson as the Prisoner is charged with . Justice Burdus . Here are two Gold Rings , three Diamond Rings , here are some Pearls delivered to me by Aaron Hendrick . Q. to J. Burdus . Did you examine the Prisoner ? Justice Burdus . At first he made no Confession , but afterwards he confessed he had sold several Jewels to Hendrick . He gave him a Bill of Parcels , with a Receipt under his Hand . Q . Sir , did he tell you how he came by them ? Justice Burdus . He gave different Accounts , sometimes he denied it , sometimes he said he had only the Rings . At first he denied that he had any Thing ; then upon having this Receipt produced to me , I asked if this was his Receipt . The first Day he denied all ; the second Day , when he saw the Particulars produced , he owned it was his Hand-writing , and he received the Money for them , but said , that he found them in a Bag in the Dust-hole in the Gate-house . The Writing is as follows : London , Nov. 6 , 1746 . - Three Diamond Rings , the Sum of 25 l. Received the Contents at the same Time , John Poulter . Q. to Aaron Hendrick . Do you know either of the Prisoners at the Bar ? Hendrick . I know Mr Poulter . Q . Had you any Dealings with him at any Time ? What did you buy of him ? Hendrick . Forty-nine Pearls , and three Diamond Rings . Q . When did you buy them ? Hendrick . I bought them the latter End of October . One of the Rings he insisted upon having again , he said it was a Family-Ring . I bought two Diamonds of him , and one Socket , out of which the Diamond was taken . The Ring that he insisted upon having again , I put a Crystal in , and sent it to him . Q . What did you give for them ? Hendrick . I gave him 25 l. for the two Rings , and one Diamond . Q . What can you sell the Diamonds to a Gentleman for ? Hendrick . For about 30 Guineas , or thereabouts . Q . Did you buy any Thing else of him ? Hendrick . Yes , I bought forty-nine Pearls . Q . What did you give for these ? Hendrick . 4 s. 6 d. a-piece . Q . What are they worth to be sold to a Gentleman for his Lady ? Hendrick . I take them to be worth 6 or 7 s. or thereabouts . Q . Did he give you an Account how he came by them ? Hendrick . I had an unhappy Brother-in-law in the Gate-house at that Time ; he sent me a Letter , that there was a Gentleman had some Diamonds and Pearls to sell . When I came , I said to my unhappy Brother , Who is the Gentleman ? And he said , it was the Turnkey ; I said , I did not care to buy of such People ; he said I might , for he gave great Security , and he had married a Wife with a Fortune , and they were to take a great Inn , and they had bought fourteen Beds already , and had a Mind to part with these Things . At first he shew 'd me a single Diamond ; so says he , if you come in a Day or two , I shall have one bigger . Accordingly I came in a Day or two , so then he shewed me all the three , and he said one of them was a Family-Ring , that he must not part with that . Q . Do you know any Thing of the Woman ? Hendrick . When I came , she had one of them on her Finger . Q. to William Dalrymple , Esq ; Sir , do you believe that all or any of these Pearls , that are here produced , are your 's ? Dalrymple . Not above two or three and thirty of these Pearls were mine . I believe they are mixed : I believe , that Part of these were taken by Matthew Henderson . As to the other Jewels , the two Rings , I am positive to them . I have had them for sixteen Years ; as to the other , it might be in the Possession of my poor Wife , but I can not tell whether it was or no . I believe there was forty-six Pearls , but two were taken off : that Necklace was bought of the Charitable Corporation , and cost 147 l. Q. to Hendrick . How came you to buy these Things so , that cost 141 Pounds ? [ Hendrick could say but little in Answer to this Question . ] Q to Robert Dalrymple , Esq ; Was you before Justice De Veil ? Robert Dalrymple . Upon the 25th of March I was desired by Captain Dalrymple to go to the House , and take care of the two Servants that were supposed to be guilty of the Murder . I afterwards carried them before Sir Thomas De Veil . and they were severally examined ; and it appeared upon some Circumstances , that Matthew Henderson had been guilty of the Robbery and Murder . At last Henderson owned he had stolen the Things before Poulter , and Poulter ( the Prisoner ) was sent to Henderson 's Wife 's Lodgings for the Box , in which were these Things , and there was a small Box put into the large one , in the Presence of Poulter ; at that Time the great Box was produced before the Justice , but the little one was not . Q. to Sarah Callow . Do you know the Prisoner Poulter ? What Profession is he of ? Callow . He was the Turnkey of the Goal when Henderson was in Custody . Q . Had you any Discourse with him about the Goods stolen by Henderson ? Callow . I never had any Discourse , no farther than at the Time that Henderson was in Custody , he came to lock up the Goal , and he brought up the Boy to my Husband who is a Debtor there , he brought him up to lie with him . My Husband said , What , bring up Murderers to lie with them ! The Prisoner ( Poulter ) said , he could not help it ; he also said , he had taken an Instrument out of the House of Office , that his Lady was killed with . Poulter told this to my Husband and I. Q . From whose House of Office ? Callow . That he had taken a Hatchet , or Cleaver , I can not say which , from the Captain 's House , and that he had been at the Boy 's Wife 's Lodgings to fetch a Box , and said there was two or three Rings and a Necklace , and said , with an Oath , he believed Sir Thomas De Veil had them . Q . Did you ever see them in his Possession ? Callow . Yes , I have had the Rings several Times in my Hand ; I had the Curiosity to look at them . About five Months ago , there was a Man committed for Felony , that had formerly been great with Mr Poulter , and he loaded him with Irons . The Man wanted a Letter to be wrote to some Friend ; whilst the Letter was writing , he asked me if I saw Mrs Poulter go out To-day dressed ; I said what was she dressed in , and he spoke of the Rings ; I said , that was no new Thing . I had seen that before : So the Man said , if he could get clear of that , he would blow him , for they belonged to Captain Dalrymple . So when I saw them again , I was confirmed that they were Diamonds , and I thought I would go to Captain Dalrymple , to speak to him about it . Q . Do you believe these to be the Rings she wore ? Callow . My Lord , I believe they are ? Q . Is that Woman , the Prisoner , reputed to be Poulter 's Wife . Callow . Yes , my Lord , she goes for his Wife ; but several Women have come and claimed him for their Husband besides her . Prisoner . My Lord , please to ask her what that Prisoner 's Name was . Callow . He is gone beyond Sea , I can not tell his Name , but the Woman has frequently wore these things ; he has often beat her for wearing them ; she wore them , and has washed her Hands in them ; she has threatned him , that she could swear a Smack of Robbery against him , as she used to term it . Council for the Prisoner . First in Point of Law I would submit to your Lordship , how far the Evidence can affect the Prisoner , as to make him accessory to this Felony , as receiving them , knowing them to be stolen . The Gentlemen , in the opening of the Matter , they have been pleased to say , that there were two Ingredients that went to this Matter , to induce the Court to believe the Prisoner knew these things to be stolen - The first is charging Sir Thomas De Veil with it ; the next Place going to Henderson 's Wife 's Lodging ; that this was presumptive Proof that these things were stolen . As to one Part , we shall only observe that the Prisoner went with the Constable to take care of Henderson , as he was his Prisoner , the Constable went with him , and brought the Box corded before the Justice . The Prisoner further urges in his Favour , to shew his Innocency , that he did not know these things to be stolen ; that from the first Time he found the things , she wore them constantly . Q to Joshua Brogdon . As you were Sir Thomas De Veil 's Clerk , when there was a Warrant granted to search Henderson 's Lodgings , did the Constable go with Poulter ? Was the Box brought back corded ? Brogdon . When the things were missing , the Rings and Necklace , Sir Thomas asked Poulter if he knew any thing of them . Henderson confessed that he had stolen them , and that the little Box was put into the great Box . Henderson was so strictly searched , that it was impossible it should be about him , for his Shoes and Stockings were taken off , that he could not secret any thing . Q. to Enock Stock . What is your Profession ? Stock A Clog-maker . Q . Do you know at what Time you first saw any Jewels or Rings that Poulter found ? Stock . As we were cleaning the Goal . I saw Parker story and take up something , and I cried out Halves . Q . Did he not show you what it was ? Stock . I saw them publickly in the Goal , but I did not know the Value of them , nor he neither . Q . How came you in the Prison ? Stock I was sent there for an Assault ; he brought them from under the Gateway , where he throwed the Beads . Q . So he shewed to all the Prisoners what a Lucky Day he had ? Stock . I have seen them lay in the publick Goal for half an Hour together . Q . Who is the Keeper of the Goal ? Stock . Mr Davage . Court . Did all the Treasure that was found in the Goal , all belong to the Turnkey ? Martha Stock . I went to the Goal to carry my Husband some Victuals just as the Door was opened , he threw the Dust out , and he took up something , and opened it , and I saw the three Rings and loose Beads . Q . What Time was this ? Stock . As near as I can guess , the latter End of May , or the beginning of June , as I went to carry my Husband his Breakfast . Q . Who threw the Dust out of the Prison ? Stock . Poulter . Q . Did not your Husband cry Halves ? Stock . Yes , he did . Q . How came he not to insist upon it ? What did your Husband find ? Stock . A Silver Cork skrew . Q . Did you see the Woman with these Rings ? Did you not think the Rings would become your Finger as well as Mrs Poulter 's , when your Husband cried Halves ? Stock . He would not part with them out of his Custody . Rachel Browning . I was going to the Gate-house to pay Mr Poulter 3 s. 6 d. that I owed him , and he took a Bit of Leather out of the Dirt , and he said he had found something , and there was three Rings and a Necklace . Q . Did you see him throw out the Dust ? Browning . I did not see him empty the Dust , but I saw him pick the Things up . There was three Rings , and Beads . Q . What Time was this ? Browning . It might be about Noon , or two or three o'Clock , I can not justly say the Time . [ The Prisoner 's Witnesses were very contradictory in their Accounts , particularly Martha Stock , she says it was in the Morning when she went to carry her Husband 's Breakfast the Prisoner pick these Things up she said it was about one or two or three o'Clock , that she saw him take these Things out of the Dust that he threwed out Farther his Witnesses say , it was the beginning of June that these Things were found , when the Witness Callow swears she saw the Rings upon his Wife 's Fingers the beginning of May ] Elizabeth Bradbury , otherwise Poulter , acquitted , John Poulter , guilty .

Samson Hendrick was indicted for stealing five Hats , the Goods of Arthur Harris , late of Butcher-hall lane , Newgate street , the 21st of Feb. 1743 . Q. to Arthur Harris . What Business are you ? Harris . I am a Hatter ; when this Fact was committed . I lived in Butcher-hall lane , Newgate-street , it was the 21st Day of February I lost the Hats , in 1743 . Q . Where were the Hats when you lost them ? Harris . The Prisoner at the Bar came to my House in Butcher hall lane , to bring him a Sample of Hats to the South Sea Coffee-house ; accordingly I went with them . Q . Did you know the Prisoner before ? Harris . I never saw him before that Time . As I went into the Coffee House , there was a Gentleman that saw me go in . I stopp 'd to the Door to have some Conversation with him , and I left the Hats upon the Table in the Coffee-house , with this Man , the Prisoner . I saw him come out with them in his Hand , as I stood at the Door talking I did not go after him - I did not suspect him - I thought he was going to shew them to some Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood . Q . How long was it after you brought the Hats to the Coffee house that he came out with them ? Harris . About three or four Minutes . Q . How came you that you did not ask him what he was about to do with them ? Harris . I had no Suspicion he was so handsomely dress 'd , with a laced Waistcoat , and handsome Wigg , & c I stayed three or four Hours , but he did not return I enquired of the Coffee-house People , and they knew nothing of him ; and I heard afterwards at the Exchange , that he was gone to Holland , he was dress 'd in a laced Waistcoat , and Spencer Wig , and a good Coat , and a laced Hat Q . Had you never seen him before ? Harris . No ; I went to several , and enquired if they knew of one Samson Hendrick . About six Weeks ago I was enquiring after him ; and I heard he used a House in Covent Garden , I think they call it Lady Mordington 's , a Gaming house ; I went there , and there I found him , so I spoke to him ; he said if I would go down Stairs he would talk with me ; he came down and spoke to me ; he said if you will stay a little , a Friend and I will come and speak to you . I went to get a Constable , the mean Time he got away , and was stopp 'd by a Chairman ; and when I came back , the Man told me he was before the Justice , the Justice committed him for further Examination the next Day , the next Day I appeared , he said he was very sorry , but he was in Liquor the Night before , and he did not know me . He said he had a Suit of Cloaths in Pawn , and a laced Hat , or a Coat and a laced Hat in Pawn , for two Guineas ; he would give me that if I would not prosecute him . I told him I would not do any such thing . Q . Are you certain of the Prisoner ? Harris . Yes , my Lord , I am sure he is the same Person . Q. to the Prisoner . Have you any Questions to ask ? Prisoner . My Lord , I was brought before Justice Burdus the 27th of October , and I was committed for further Examination the 23 d. This is the Man that brought the Order from the Justice , to bring me before his Worship . At the Corner of the Street , says he , Mr Hendrick , Is it not better to make up this Affair ? There was another Fellow with him at the same Time , says he , I have no more Remark to hang a Jew than a common Dog in the Street . Says he , if you will give me a Guinea , I will go and tell the Justice I do not know you . I said I tell you what I will do , seeing you are determined to prosecute me right or wrong , I says I will give you my Cloaths , and go home naked : he says , send away to your Friends and get a Guinea , and I will not prosecute you . In the Morning he told the Justice , he could not swear to the Prisoner ; at the Evening , the Justice on that Account was for discharging me ; he said , pay do not , I have look 'd at him again , and I will now swear to him . The Prisoner , for the Truth of his Affections in Part , referred the Court to Justice Burdus 's Clerk , who was present . Q. to - Brogdon . Do you remember this Matter of the Prisoner 's being brought before Mr Burdus ? Brogdon . When the Prosecutor gave his first Information , he pretended first , that he delivered these Goods to the Man , afterwards the Man run away with them , and he did not see him ; then afterwards he said , he turned his Back , and the Hats were gone . He was asked if there was no body else , then he said there were many ; then he said , that he saw him go out , afterwards he wanted to get Money of him to make it up . I heard him speak backward and forwards , and desired him to go and make it up afterwards . He came the next Time again , and said he could not believe that he was the Man ; then he talked again , that the Man had confessed at St Martin 's , that he did the Robbery , therefore he insisted upon the Prosecution . Q. to the Prisoner . Where have you been for two or three Years past ? Prisoner . My Lord , I have not been out of England since I was six Years old : my Business is in Exchange-Alley , I use Exchange Alley daily . I can prove it that I have been every Day in the City or out of the City . Q. to Harris What do you say to the Account Mr Brogdon gives ? He says you were in half a dozen Stories . Harris . I insisted at first that he was the Person . Q. to the Prisoner . What Prison was you in ? Prisoner . At the Gate house , my Lord . Acquitted . 19 . + Peter De la Fountain was indicted for feloniously forging and counterfeiting a Promissory Note , under the Hand of one John Baptist-Zannier , for the Payment of 220 l. to one Marie Legrand , Widow , or Order , three Months after Date ; which said Paper writing is as followeth : January 9 , 1746 . I promise to pay to Marie Legrandd , Widdow , or Order , the Sum of Two hundred and Twenty Pounds , three Months after Date ; for Value received , by me L. 220 0 0 John Baptita Zannier . With an Intent to defraud the said John Baptita Zannier , against the Form of the Statute , and against the Peace , & c. The second Account for feloniously uttering and publishing the same , knowing it to be forged , with an intent to defraud the said John Baptita Zannier , against the Form of the Statute , and against the Peace , & c. Q. to Francis Parry . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Parry . I have seen him two or three Times . I saw him when he was confined in Newgate ; he was under an Arrest , in an Action of Debt . Q . What was the Sum he owed ? Parry . About 40 l. and the Gentlewoman ( his Creditor ) Mrs Portland , she had committed the Management of that Affair to me ; to offer me some Satisfaction , he sent me several Messages , he desired me very much to come to him , by the Letter , telling me he had something to offer that might be satisfactory ; at length I did go to him , then it was he offered me this Note ; he offerrd it as a collateral Security ; he said he had no Money to pay the Debt , or any Part of it . Q . Then you received it of him ? Parry . Yes , Sir , he gave me this Note as a collateral Security for the Use of Mrs Portland . Q . What Conversation had you upon the Note ? Parry . I hesitated a little at first about the taking it , not that I suspected a Forgery ; but because the Drawer of the Note , and the Endorser , were both utterly Strangers to me . I knew nothing of either of them . I thought that it might be worth nothing , therefore I did not know whether it might be any Security at all or no . I asked him if it was a Note that he had fairly come by , or something to that Purpose ; he told me it was ; then I expressed my Doubt , as not knowing the Drawer , or the Endorser ; at Length I did agree to take the Note , not in any great Confidence of recovering any Money upon it . I looked upon the Debt as desperate , and I thought I might as well take that as his own Security . He told me that Baptita Zannier was Purveyor to the British Forces abroad , and there was Money due to him from the Government . I did not accept of the Note as Payment , nor would I be liable to raise Money by it . Q How long was it after the Note was given to you , that you took his Bond ? Parry I believe about two or three Days , he was discharged upon giving the Bond . Q . Did you enquire any thing after the Endorser ? Parry . No , I did not , because I expected so little from the Note . Council for the Defendant . Sir , I think when you had Discourse with De la Fountain , that you had no Suspicion of it 's being forged ? Parry . I asked him if it was a fair and honest Note ; he said it was . He said that he had it from Mrs Marie Legrand ; to the best of my Remembrance , he told me that Mrs Marie Legrand was not an English Woman , and that she was abroad . Q. to John Ryley . Do you know Zannier 's Writing ? Ryley . Yes , very well , I have received near an 100 Letters from him , so that I believe 't is not his Hand writing , neither is it spelled as he commonly spells his Name . I believe this Note is an Attempt to counterfeit his writing , but not his writing . Court Give the Reason why you believe that 't is not his Hand . Ryley . The cut of the Letters is not so stiff as his real Hand-writing . Q . Is that the only Reason why you think that 't is not his Hand-writing , because 't is not so stiff ? Ryley . The Letters are straighter wrote than those he writes ; he writes in an outlandish Hand , but writes it very well . Q . Can you recollect any thing that past before the Justice ? Ryley . Sir Thomas De Veil told me in his Presence , that he said it was given him by a Woman for some Piece of Gallantry , and he did not deny it . Q . Did you know or hear him say any thing in Regard to one Marie Legrand . Ryley . No , I never saw her nor him , till I saw him before Sir Thomas De Veil . Q . What is your Business ? Ryley . I am a Student in the Temple . I am not called to the Bar yet . Q . Do you live in the Temple now ? Ryley . I live by the Temple - near it . Q. by the Council for the Defendant . Do not you know that he was acquainted with a French Lady , called Legrand ? Ryley No . Council . Then you never saw any French Lady at Mr Zannier 's ? Do you remember the Time that Mr Zannier was in Newgate ? Did you never there see a Lady with him ? Ryley . There was a Gentlewoman that was Waiting-Woman to on Mrs Herald , a Lady of Fortune . Q. to Oliver Mc Allesler . Are you acquainted with Mr John Batita Zannier ? Did you ever see him write ? - Look upon that Note . Mc Allester . I believe that Note is not his Handwriting , my Lord . I frequently saw him write , my Lord . In about September last , Mr. Baptita Zannier was arrested for 300 l. and he sent for me pretty early to come to him . I met him going with the Officer to the Officer 's House ; upon this I enquired of Zannier , if he knew Marie Legrand , or the Person to whom this Note was payable . I met Mr Parry at Guild-hall , and told him of this Arrest . Mr Parry then said , I have a Note by me , put into my Hand by the Prisoner ; and if I do n't mistake , 't is signed by such a Person . I told him I believed that this Man ( Zannier ) had no Dealings with any such People ; and if he would give me an Opportunity of seeing the Note , I would enquire into the Matter ; the next Morning , Mr Zannier went with me , and we took a Note of 25 l. of Zannier 's , and we compared it with this Note that we apprehended was counterfeited , accordingly we found it to be so ; we then went to Sir Thomas De Veil , a nd a Warrant was issued out for apprehending the Prisoner , and he was brought before him ; and he said to him , Did not you tell me upon your first Examination , that you had this Note of a Lady for a Favour done her : and in a solemn Manner , the Prisoner stood up , and said , if that was not signed by Zannier , there was not a God in Heaven , or to such Purpose . Council for the Prisoner . You seemed to be acquainted with the Transactions of Business about the Treasury ? What is your Business ? I would ask you whether you are not an Attorney or Sollicitor ? Mc Allester . 'T is a Question I am not bound to answer . Q . What Country are you ? Mc Allester . I am an Irishman . Q. to - Backhouse . Have you often seen the Prisoner write ? Backhouse . I have often seen him write , and I believe the Note is not of his Writing . Court . There is an Affadavit which was made the last Sessions , which was the 15th of October , 1746 . 'T was made in order to put off the Trial , which was to have come on against this Person the last Sessions ; it is an Affadavit made by the Prisoner and Benjamin Stephens , a Man produced as a Witness , and he swears , that Mrs Marie Legrand was residing in Paris ; and that Mary Patridy , her Servant , was a material Witness in his Cause . Farther he says , that the said Marie Legrand , and Mary Patridy , did , in June last , go from London to Paris , but are not yet returned ; but that they would come to London in November , or the Beginning of December next ; and he believes they are now there and not returned : at the Time of their going , they said they would return in a few Months ; he swears that he believes they will come to London in a little Time . This was made use of the last Sessions , to put off the Trial . Q. to Mr Parry . What Conversation had you with the Prisoner ? Parry . I think in Conversation , he said the Note was given abroad , and sent to him by Mrs Marie Legrand . Council for the Prisoner . We have several Witnesses to prove that this Note was written by Mr Baptita Zannier , we shall confirm that Evidence , that it was given by Mrs Legrand , to Mr De la Fountain . Q. to Joseph Gotee . Are you acquainted with Mr Baptita Zannier 's Hand writing ? Gotee . My Lord , I have several Papers of his Hand writing ; he brought me two Sailors , pretending that they had large Shares in Prize-money . I laid out a great deal about them ; and it was but about five Pounds that they had to receive : they gave me Bills of their Shares . Q . Do you think this is Zannier 's writing ? Gotee . I believe in my Conscience - I believe 't is his Hand-writing . The Freedom of Letter is the same I have seen him write in my House . Q . Do you know the Character of Zannier ? Gotee . Sir , I ca n't say any thing for him , as he hath deceived me in Money about these Shares . [ This Evidence produced two Bills of Sale , which he knew to be the Hand writing of Zannier ; and upon inspecting this Note , he believes it to be his Hand-writing ] John Baptista Blewet . I can give no Account whether 't is his writing or no . - Lameneer . [ Answers by an Interpreter . ] Ask him if he ever saw Zannier write ? Interpreter . Yes , my Lord . Q . How often ? Interpreter . Very often . Q . Have you seen him write his Name ? Interpreter . Yes . Q . Do you believe this to be the writing of Zannier ? Interpreter . I ca n't absolutely say whether it is his signing or not . Q . Do you believe it to be his writing ? Interpreter . He says there is a great Appearance , but he ca n't absolutely affirm it . Q . Ask him whether he believes that to be his Hand , or he believes that it is not his Hand ? Interpreter . He can not testify the one nor the other . Peter Kopee answered by an Interpreter . Ask him , Sir , if he has seen Zannier 's Hand-writing . Interpreter . Yes , my Lord . Q How often ? Interpreter . Many Times . I have seen him write often . Q . Ask him if he believes that Note to be the writing of Zannier 's . Interpreter . He believes that to be of his signing . Court . Ask him this Question , Whether he believes that to be Zannier 's Hand writing or not ? Interpreter . He says 't is like it . Q. to Robert Daniel . Did you ever see this Zannier write ? Daniel . I have seen him write very often , both abroad and in England . Q . Do you believe , Sir , this Note to be the writing of Zannier or not ? [ This old Gentleman looked very carefully over the Note , then the Question was put to him again . ] Well , Sir , can you form any Judgment ? Daniel . I believe it is Zannier 's Hand disguised ; the first Part is altered , the latter Part grows more fluently , and more like his Hand , when I compare it with a Letter from him ; besides I have heard frequently that he writes his Name , when it is of no Import , then he writes only his Sirname ; and when he writes his Sirname , then he abridges Batist , and at Length Baptista . Q . Sir , I ask you whether or know you do believe that 't is Zannier 's , or 't is not ? Daniel . My Lord , I do believe it is , though I believe 't is disguised in Part . Q . Let me know your Reason why you think it disguised ? Daniel . The first Part seems to be writ steadily , and with a Design to alter his Hand ; then when he goes to the latter End , then he comes more freely . Q . What Reason can you give why he should disguise his Hand ? Daniel . I will give you my Opinion about it ; I know the Man so well , as perhaps most do , he has been a Cheat in every Thing ; he is a Man of a bad Character , and may be capable of counterfeiting and disguising his own Hand . Benjamin Stephens . I went with Marie Legrand to Newgate . Q . When ? Stephens . It was the latter End of May , or the beginning of June , I can not be certain . Q . Who did you go with ? Stephens . With Marie Legrand . Q . Upon what Account did you go with her to Newgate ? Stephens . She called at my House , and she desired me to go a little Way with her to see a Friend in Distress ; so I waited on her , and went with her to Newgate , and it was to Captain De la Fountain . Q . What was it you saw her do in Newgate ? Stephens . I saw her endorse the Backside of the Note , and give it to the Prisoner at the Bar , and said in broken English , I give you this to get your Discharge , and this Note is as good as the Bank . That is all that I know of it . Q . What was the Money ? Stephens . Two hundred and twenty Pounds . Q . For what Purpose was it that she endorsed or gave the Note to Mr. De la Fountain ? I suppose it was in a friendly Manner , as he was an Acquaintance of her 's for some Years . Was there an Intimacy and Friendship between De la Fountain and Legrand ? Stephens . Yes , she was a foreigner , she lodged at my House for two Months in Queen-Street . Q . Do you know where she is now ? Stephens . I heard that she was gone to France . Q . Had you ever seen Mr De la Fountain before you went to Newgate ? Stephens . Never in my Life Q . What Business did Mrs Legrand follow ? Stephens . She appeared as a Gentlewoman . Q . Did you ever see her in Company with Zannier ? Stephens . I never did . Q . Had Mrs Legrand any thing to supply Zannier for this Note ? Stephens . She had no Goods or Business at all ; I never saw Zannier . Q . Where do you live ? Stephens . I live at No . 3. in Prescot-street ; I am Partner with my Brother . Council for the Prosecution . Stephens , you told us before , you lived at Bull-Wharf in Thames-Street , had two or three Houses of your own , that you let two , and lodged with the other Tenant youself . Now let us know the Names of your Tenants . Stephens . Phillips and Sharp . Q . Which of your Tenants did you lodge with ? Stephens . At the hither one . Q . What is his Name ? Stephens . I told you Phillips . Q . When did you receive the last Rent ? Stephens . Why I have sold them ; I have employed threescore Men for three Years together in Fleet street . Council Canst tell me any of the Names of the Parish-Officers that you paid your Taxes to ? What is the Minister 's Name of the Parish ? Tell me the Name of any one Person that was a Parish-Officer while thou hadst these House , before thou soldest them ? What Rent did they pay ? Stephens . One went at 16 l. and the other at 7 . Council . Who were Tenants of those Houses ? Stephens . Phillips is one , and Sharp the other . My Father left them to me . Q . What did you sell the three for ? Stephens . Sharp gave me 70 l. for the three . Council . Where did you live when Mrs Legrand lodged with you ? Stephens . At the Corner where my Father did . Council for the Prosecution . If such Doctrines and Evidences had not been advanced , that I never heard before , I should have no Occasion to give you any Trouble . It is an amazing Thing to me , that in proving the Hand now before you , which is wrote more regular and large than any one that has been produced , & c. The learned Gentleman says , he thinks it is his Hand-writing disguised , because the End looks as if it were real , and the Beginning and Middle bad . Would not the Party , would he not have taken care that it should have been written proper ? The Bond and Powers that are produced , they are as convincing Evidence , that it can not be his real Hand ; they are not spelt the same , not turned the same . It shews the Man wrote an even , regular Hand in general ; and how he could be induced to write so now , is very strange . This wicked Witness you have called up , how , when the Man has prevaricated as he has done , whether he is a Man to be credited or no ? The last Time he was examined here , it was enquired where he lived ; he then gave an Account it was at Bull-Wharf ; there was no such Person ever there , Landlord or Tenant . What do they make further ? why , that Mrs Legrand , the French Gentlewoman , came into Newgate , and this Fellow is so hard as to say , he saw the Woman write the Name Legrand while she was in Newgate . These Gentlemen are more fortunate than other People , that Ladies should be so much in Love with them . I do not know any thing so charming they could see in his Face , to induce them to do such Favours as these . Our Inquiry is after Truth . I desire nothing that may bear hard against him . Q. to Christopher Backhouse . Do you know Bull-Wharf in Thames-street ? Was you directed to enquire after Benjamin Stephens ? Backhouse . Yes . Q . When ? Backhouse . One Day the last Sessions I went to almost all the Inhabitants thereabouts . I had lived in Queenhithe five or six Years before . Q . What Account had you of Benjamin Stephens ? Backhouse . The Account I had was , that there was no such Person ever known . I asked twenty People ; I asked all the old Inhabitants that must needs have known a Person that had an Estate of three Houses . Court You did not enquire at the Hoop-benders ? Backhouse . No , but over the Way I did . [ The Witness ( Stephens ) was very severely censured by the Court , as he appeared to be notoriously perjured , and instead of his Evidence availing any thing to the Prisoner , it helped to prove fatal to him . ] Guilty of feloniously uttering the Note , knowing it to be stolen , but not of the Forgery . Guilty , Death . 20 , 21 . + John Wilkins and Henry Cobb were indicted for a Robbery on the King 's Highway , committed on Jane Todd , putting her in bodily Fear , and taking from her one Camblet Gown , value 10 s. one Pair of Breeches , value 5 s. and one Bag , the Goods of David Silver of Islington , the 25th of October .

Out of Goswel street . Q . Do you know the Place they met you ? Todd . In Compton-street , they followed me all up the Street . Q . Which of them ? Todd . That Soldier with the Handkerchief about his Head ( Wilkins ) Q . Well , what did he do ? Todd . He followed me up Compton-street ; now and then he gave me a Jobb with a Stick , and he waited for the other to come to him several Times , and called him . Q . What did he say ? Todd . I think he called him Tom , then they went and stood at the Watch-house at the End of Wood's-Close ; he stood there and called for the other , then they both came up and stood under the Golden Fleece Window , and there was another Gentleman that was coming to London , or going to Islington , and he went into my Lord Cobham 's ; so these Soldiers they went and stood at the Turk's-head Field gate ; I saw them stand there , and I turned again , and as I was turning back again , the Soldier he run after me , he with an Handkerchief about his Head ( Wilkins ) he ran after me , and overtook me , and throwed me down , and took the Things from me . Q . What Things ? Todd . The scarlet Gown , and Snuff coloured Breeches , and another wrapped up in a Cloth Bag , they took and slung them into the Ditch . Q . Was that all the Things ? Todd . And a coloured Handkerchief , they flung them into the Ditch , and afterwards jump 'd in , and took them out , and away they run . Court . You say but one took away the Things from you ? Todd . It was he with the Handkerchief slung them into the Ditch , then jump 'd in and took them out , and ran away . Q . Did you see any more than one ? Todd . There was two at the Turk's-head Gate , but there was but one that meddled with me . Q . Where was you when they met with you ? Todd . I was under the Turk 's head Window , they stood both together at the Field-gate when I saw them ; but whether the other Man went away , I can not tell . Q . But as it was dark , how do you know they are them ? Todd . By their Tallness they are the same . Q . When did you see them afterwards ? You saw the Soldier jump into the Ditch , and took up the Bundle that he took from you , and run away Now go on : What followed after this ? Do you live at Islington ? Todd . Yes , Sir . Q .

I ran down as far as the Turnpike , and the Turnpike-man catched the Soldier . Q . What followed after this ? Todd . The other Soldier was catched , ( he with the Handkerchief about his Head ) and swore that I was his Sister . Q . What did you do after this , you say both the Soldiers were taken ? What became of them ? Todd . Sir , they were catched , and I went before the Justice that Night , and the Justice was not at Home I believe ; and I went before the Justice the next Morning , the Gentlemen went with me . Q . Was it not very dark between six and seven o'Clock ? Todd . I could see their Cloaths , but I did not mind their Faces . Court . You say there was but one that meddled with you ? Todd . No , and he had his Hair on then . Q . How do you know that 's the Soldier ? Todd . He has cut his Hair off . I look 'd at him as I was on the Ground , and cried out Murder . I was frightened ; I was afraid they were about to kill me . Q. to Richard Vaughan . What do you know of this Matter ? Vaughan . On Saturday the 25th of October , I was coming from Islington , between the Hours of six and seven , and just as I came by my Lord Cobham 's Window , I saw the Prisoner at the Bar , John Wilkins , otherwise Roberson , take the Bundle from underneath the Girl as she lay upon the Ground . Q . Did you know the Man before ? Vaughan . No , my Lord . Q . Are you sure that 's the Man ? Vaughan . Yes , my Lord , I am sure that is him that has the Handkerchief about his Head . After he had robbed the Girl , he run into the Road ; I pursued him with the Bundle under his Arm , down to the Turnpike and back again , almost to the Place where he committed the Robbery , then he dropped the Bundle in the Road , thinking that I might stop to take it up , but I let it lay , and pursued him . Just as he was entering into Wood 's Close Field , I , with the Assistance of another Gentleman , took him and carried him into my Lord Cobham 's , which is a Publick-house ; we were there about five or six Minutes , and he went out along with the Constable , and shewed him were he dropped the things ; the Bundle lay where he dropped it . The other Prisoner , Cobb , he came in , alledging that Wilkins was drunk , and he said the Girl was his Sister , and that he had been beating of her , because she would not do as he would have her . Then , my Lord , we asked Wilkins if he knew this Cobb , he said no , he did not know him ; and we asked Cobb whether he knew Wilkins , he said yes , he had known him two or three Years , and had been in his Company a great many Times . So , my Lord , we searched Cobb , and took an Hanger away from him ; that is all , my Lord , I know of the Affair . Q . Did you see Cobb at any Time before he came into the House ? Vaughan . No , my Lord . Q. to the Prisoners . Will either of you ask this Witness any Questions ? Cobb . He never saw me before I came into that House . Court . Well , he does not say that he did . - Barnes . As I was coming to Town the 25th of October . Q . Was you with Vaughan ? Barnes . Yes , about the Distance of three Yards before we came to my Lord Cobham 's , I saw the Prisoner with the Handkerchief about his Head , take the Bundle from under the Girl , and immediately he jumped into the Ditch , and then into the Road , and made towards the Turnpike ; Mr Vau ghan after him directly to the Road ; and I went towards the Turnpike . Just about the Place where he took it from the Girl , there he dropped it ; he turned to the Right , near Wood 's Close , and Vaughan took hold of the Flap of his Coat : the Noise of the Girl alarmed the House , and Mr Hayward came out of the House , upon that he collared him , and Vaughan said this is he . Hayward said , You Villain , how could you serve the Child so ? says Wilkins , be a Friend to me , and I will tell you . Q . Where was the Child ? Barnes . The Girl stood under the Window when I left her ; when Wilkins said , be a Friend to me , Hayward said we will , if you will shew us the things , with that he went out , and showed him ; with that the other Prisoner , Cobb , came in , and said the Prisoner Wilkins was in Liquor , let him go about his Business . Some other Gentlemen in the House said , How should you know he was in Liquor , unless you were an Accomplice with him ? They insisted upon his being secured as well as the other . The other Prisoner ( Cobb ) stood about the Distance of a Yard and a half from the Girl , when the Prisoner Wilkins took the things from her , but I did not see him do any thing . Q . How did you know it was he ? Barnes . My Lord , I never lost Sight of him . Court . You have told us that you know Wilkins , but how did you know the other Prisoner Cobb ? Barnes . I ca n't swear to his Face . He had a great blue Coat on ; and the Person that came in , that said Wilkins was in Liquor , I can take upon me to swear , that that is the Person that stood up against the House . Then we had them before a Magistrate , and there was an Hanger found upon Cobb . Q to Robert Hayward Give an Account of what you know with Relation to this Matter . Hayward . I was at the House of Mr Taunton 's , at my Lord Cobham 's Head , on Saturday the 25th of October last , where I heard an Out cry of Murder repeated two or three Times ; immediately after added , Stop Thief . There were several Gentlemen in the Room . I said , Gentlemen , will no-body go to the Assistance of this Person ? Q . What was the cry ? Hayward . The Voice of a Girl . I said , Will none of you go to the Assistance of this Person ? Upon which Mr Greenwood , the Constable , immediately turned out of the Door along with me ; when we came out , there was a Person running up the Road , crying Stop him , Stop him , this is one ; upon which I ran up the Causeway ; this Mr Vaughan pursued him , and brought him as it were into my Arms . I saw the Girl . I said , You sorry Villain , how could you meddle with this Child ? Where are the things you have taken from her ? Upon which I led him into the House , and I told him , if he would tell me where the things were that he had taken from the Child , he should go about his Business ; he then , my Lord , begged that I would stand his Friend , and if I would , he would go and shew me where the things were ; upon which I led him out by the Collar , and he went across the Way into the high Road , and there the Bundle lay ; and I took it up , and we brought him back into the House ; as I was bringing him into the House , the Prisoner , Cobb , was standing under the Window ; and he says to me , let the Fellow go , for he is in Liquor , he is fuddled , and said that the Girl was his Sister , and because the little B - h would not do as he would have her , he had pushed her down , and that was all , so desired that I would let him go ; so we charged the Constable with them both , and we went before the Justice the next Morning ; the Night when we went to the Justice 's , he was not in the Way ; I sent to one of the Under-keepers of Bridewell , and he asked if we had search 'd them , we said no ; upon which we searched them and found the Hanger . Q. to Thomas Greenwood , Constable . Where had you those things ? Greenwood . I pick 'd them up in the Road , by the Direction of Wilkins or Roberson . Court . He went with you , did he ? Greenwood . Yes , my Lord , and these things I found in the middle of the Road in that Bag . Q. to Jane Todd . Did you know what was in that Bag ? Todd . Yes , A scarlet Gown , a Pair of Breeches , and a Handkerchief . Q . Whose were these things ? Todd . My Mistress 's . Court . You were carrying those things Home , were you not ? Todd . Yes . Q . Who is your Mistress ? Todd . Mrs Silver . Q . She has an Husband , has she not ? Todd . Yes , Sir . Court . So that Gown belonged to them , and you was carrying of it Home ? Todd . Yes , Sir . Q . What besides the Gown ? Todd . A Pair of Snuff-coloured Breeches , and a coloured Handkerchief . Q . Whose were the Breeches ? Todd . Her Brother 's , Sir . Court . Do you know your Master 's Name ? Todd . Yes . David Silver . Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say in your Defence against this Charge ? Wilkins . Please you , my Lord , I was going from Islington , and was very much in Liquor , and meeting this Girl in the Causeway , I pushed this Girl down , and the Bundle falls into the Ditch ; then she cried out , stop Thief ; then there was some Gentlemen coming along , and they laid hold of me and said , this is the Man . Q . Was this Girl your Sister ? Wilkins . Please you , my Lord , I never said she was my Sister . Q. to Cobb . What have you to say for yourself ? Cobb . My Lord , as I was getting up on Saturday Morning , this young Fellow says to me , will you take a Walk ? I goes with him to Islington , and we spent some Time playing two or three Games at Cards . Court . If I understand you right , you and your Comrade had been playing at Cards about three ; but when did you Part ? Cobb . Between the Turnpike and the Duke of Cumberland 's Head . Q . About what Time did you part ? Cobb . Between five and six o'Clock . Q . Have you any thing further to say ? Will you call any Witnesses ? Cobb . When my Comrade was taken , I heard a Disturbance ; I goes into the Yard , and that little Man with a black Wig he catches me by the Collar , and said I was one of his Confederates ; whereupon he takes my Hanger from my Side , and my Stick out of my Hand . Court . Here is one of the Witnesses saw you standing within a Yard and half of the other Prisoner , when the Bundle was taken from the Girl . Have you any Witnesses ? Court . Hayward , do you observe what Cobb said , that Wilkins ( the Prisoner ) was in Liquor ? What did you observe of it ? Hayward . The young Fellow appeared to me to be in Liquor , he begged that I would be a Friend to him , that he never did any such Thing before , but the other Prisoner ( Cobb ) put him upon it . This is going farther than I did before . Court . Cobb , have you any Witnesses ? Cobb No , my Lord , I have not . [ The above Witness ( Hayward ) discovered a compatunate Regard for the Prisoner ( Wilkins ) and by what appeared to him , that he had not been used to such a wicked Employment , and did firmly believe he was drawn into it by Cobb , who had the Success to escape , as there was not that full Evidence against him ] . Henry Cobb , acquitted , John Wilkins , otherwise Roberson , guilty , Death . The Court gave Cobb a solemn Warning to be careful of his Conduct for the future , as he had so very narrow an Escape for his Life . 22 . + William Gomes Figueiro , Yeoman , was indicted for feloniously , and without the Consent and Privity of the Keeper , or Under keeper of the Goal , called Wood-street Compter , London , did convey , and cause to be conveyed into the said Goal , certain Materials , called Paint , in order to be used by one Robert Fitzgerald , who was then a Prisoner , committed for Felony , in order to be used by the same Robert Fitzgerald as an Instrument to disguise himself , in order to facilitate his Escape out of the said Goal ; and that the said William Gomes Figueiro , the said Material , called Paint , to the said Robert Fitzgerald , the Paint being an Instrument and a Material proper to be used to disguise , in order to facilitate the Escape of the Prisoner , did then and there feloniously , and without the Consent and Privity of the Keeper or Underkeeper of the said Goal of Wood street Compter aforesaid , deliver , or cause to be delivered , ( he the said Robert Fitzgerald being a Prisoner committed to the said Goal ) with an Intent to aid and assist the said Robert Fitzgerald to attempt from and out of the said Goal , called Wood-street Compter as aforesaid , against the Form of the Statute , and against the Peace , & c.

Mr Levy , upon enquiring who was aiding and assisting , with respect to the Cloaths , had some Suspicion of Figueiro , as they had some Intimacy . I heard him say that he painted some small Part of his Face , his Eye-brows , and some small Part under the Eye ; then Mr Levy asked if he knew any thing of the Cloaths , he said he did , but he did not understand by the Laws of England , that he had committed an Offence , that was what he said in my Room .

I live in Jermyn-street , I served on the Middlesex Jury the last Sessions ; I have known the Prisoner for three Weeks Yesterday , her Husband I imagine is Benjamin Barker , he brought the Prisoner into our House the Day before she was taken up , and used her exceeding ill ; he said , You B - h you have cost me 30 l. within thse two Years . The Prisoner told my Wife , that she was a Wet-nurse , that her Husband had took the Child she had put to nurse out , and would not let her know where it was . All that she wanted of him , was to know where the Child was ; she told him , if he would allow her 4 s a Week , which he then gave to another , she would not trouble him any more . Her Husband comes the next Morning , and asked if the Prisoner was come there , and said , when she comes , I must beg of you to stop her , because I have got three or four Persons to swear a Robbery against her ; he said , a d - d B - h , if I can get her hanged or transported , she can not trouble me any more . Court . I understand , that the Prisoner 's Husband had some Dislike to her , and you imagined him to be the Author of it . Welch .

Barker , her Husband , brought her into our House the Day before she was taken , and used her exceeding ill. Q . What in your Presence ? Welch Yes , and we took her Part . The next Morning when he came , his Expression was , Is that B - h come yet ; says he , if she comes , pray be so good as to stop her ; he said , there were three or four Women to swear a Robbery against her , he said he would hang or transport her , then he should get rid of her . Q. to John Bidle . What are you ? Bidle . I am Servant to Mr Bussel . Q . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Bidle .

She staid with my Master three Weeks , the Occasion of her going away was , the Uneasiness with her Husband , that the Child did not thrive , and my Master sent me to declare how she behaved . Mr Crane the Apothecary seat her to my Master , if there had been any ill Report , he would never have done it . James Welch . I keep the Horse shoe in Jermyn-street . Q . How long have you known the Prisoner ? Welch . Three Weeks ; she was twice at our House , and by the Discourse her Husband had with her , I found that she had been married to him , or gone by his Name for two Years . Q . Well , what past then ? Welch . He called her B - h , & c. she said he had taken away her child , and if he would tell her where it was , and allow her 4 s. a Week , she would not trouble him ; he said she had cost him 30 l. within these three Years ; he took away all the Furniture of her Room for three Weeks ; he said he had only entailed a Chamber-pot upon her , or some such Expression ; she owned she had about 18 l. of his Money within two Years , with Apothecary 's Bills , and Illness : she appealed to my Wife , my Wife said that she had cost me twice as much in half the Time . So he went home with her about a 11 o'Clock , yesterday was three Weeks ; the next Morning he asked if she was come there , I said no , so he said when she came , he desired I would stop her ; he said if he could but hang her or transport her , he should get rid of her , so I desired that he would get out of the House , we did not desire such Company . It has cost me near 3 l. purely to serve the Woman , as we believe it to be a Prosecution set on Foot by the Malice and Wickedness of her Husband . The Court expressed the utmost Indignation against the inhuman Wretch of a Husband , for his base Conduct , as attested by two very credible Witnesses , and most honourably acquitted the Prisoner : and proposed ( without being asked ) to grant her a Copy of her Indictment , that might be an effectual Security against any such like Proceedings of her wicked Husband ; and if she thought sit to be a Scourge to those who have fallen in with his base Advice . The Court told the Prisoner they hoped she would make a prudent Use of it , but she might sue them for a Conspiracy or Perjury . 32 , 33.

But you do not know any thing of the six Guineas ? Price . He commonly left the Key of his Escrutore in the Room in the Window ; I have seen it as I use to go in to make his Bed . Court . So then , as you was a Servant in the House , you could go and see what Money he had at any Time ? Why , this Gentleman was out it seems every Day , and he always left the Key of his Escrutore in the Window . Price . My Lord , he locks up his Room . Court . Pray , Child , if he always locks up his Room , how do you know that he use to leave the Key of his Escrutore in the Room ? Oliver Mc Allester . My Lord , I have lived in this House , that is , Mrs Rawlins 's , since March last , this Woman that keeps the House , is a very unfortunate Woman , and often out of her Senses , and often intoxicated with Liquor ; she has often pressed me to buy her Goods , I always refused , and said I would not do it unless she would bring her Friends ; her Sister in Tavistock street with her Friends , they desired I would take these Goods into my own Hands . I have advanced some little Matters from Time to Time merely out of Compassion to her , and I have supported her from my own Table . About the 22d of October , a Lawyer and the Prisoner ( Goff ) comes to the House , pretending to have an Execution ; the Lawyer comes bullying into the the House , Sir , says he , if you will give me to much Money , you shall have these Goods , for I have an Execution , and I have brought an Appraiser . Though he had no Execution , yet be disturbed and frightened us ; he rushes in with these Prisoners , and demands the Goods away ; he came in in the most audacious Manner with inexcreable Oaths , the Woman , Mrs Rawlins , comes to me and says , for the Sake of God release me out of the Hands of these Villains ! He says to her , You old B - h I spoke to God Almighty this Morning , and he said he never made you . I never heard such Profaneness in all my Life ; at last , Sir , says he , pay me 20 l. and you shall have the Goods ; upon this the Woman begged and prayed , and said , these are a Pack of Thieves and Rogues ; says she , for God 's Sake take the Goods , and pay their Demands ; I paid him five Guineas , and Goff ( the Prisoner ) started up and said , I must have three Guineas , she owes me three Guineas in going of Errands for her , & c. She hauls out and said , he is a Rogue , and has lived upon me , and I do not owe him any thing . After the Lawyer had made a Bill of Sale to me , and I had paid Part of the Money , we went abroad to spend the Day ; upon our Return , Goff and Oldfield ( the Prisoners ) had taken Possession of the House , and swearing I should not come in , unless I would pay them 15 l. I applied to the Civil Magistrate , I got a Warrant ; the Constable said , you had as good go to the Officer of the Guard , and get a File of Musqueteers , which I did , and forced open the Street door , and these two Fellows ( the Prisoners ) bounced out of my Bed , I went up Stairs , and I saw Mr Storaca 's Door broke open , and he said he had lost six Guineas . Q. to - . Are you an Attorney ? - . Yes ; Mr M Allester sent for me , in order to advise with me what to do upon the Lawyer 's coming in the Manner he has represented it ; I , in the first Place , advised him to have nothing to do with it . but Mrs Rawlins advised him to take it upon himself ; upon which there was an Agreement made : But besides the Money that the Lawyer had paid on Mrs Rawlins 's Account , he set up another Demand for Business done . I asked him for a Bill , but he said he would lump it , and did behave , I must own , in a most extraordinary Way that ever I saw in my Life . At the same Time these Things were executed , the Key was delivered by the Lawyer to Mr Mc Allester , by Mrs Rawlins 's Direction . Q. to the Lawyer . How came all this seizing of Goods ? Lawyer . Mrs Rawlins applied to me some Time before October last , in order to sue Mr Mc Allester and Storaca , she said she was in barbarous Hands , several Times she had applied to Mr Mc Allester , and he said he could not pay her . This Mr Mc Allester pretends to say , that he is an Attorney , I said to him , do not enter into a Law-suit ; I sent to him to come to me , he came to my Apartment , and he said to me , pray do not distress me ; I said any Time before Term would do for me . Says Mrs Rawlins , I am very uneasy Mc Allester shuffles with me , I am under some Danger of their moving some of their Goods , and it appeared that they had moved off some of them ; upon that , the Goods were to be appraised , and I was to advance some Money to pay her Landlord ; upon that , the 17th of October , they were appraised ( Mr Mc Allester thinking himself greatly injured , that he should lose his Character in England , as well as he had in Ireland ) the Landlord came and seized on Saturday Night , this Mr Goff , the Prisoner at the Bar , was sent to me by the Direction of Mrs Rawlins , and told me the Goods were seized ; accordingly , on the Evening of that Day , on the 19th I believe it was , I paid the Rent and Charges of that Distress , which came to 14 l. 7 s. 10 d. besides other Charges , as eating and drinking at the Hollander , Carlisle street ; accordingly I paid it , and took the Men out of the Possession . Mrs Rawlins came to me the Monday following , says she , Mr Mc Allester has not paid me ; I wrote a Letter to him , and told him if he did not pay the Money , I would sue him ; then he told me he had a Receipt in full of Mrs Rawlins , I went and asked Mrs Rawlins , and she said she did not give him a Receipt in full ; I said , knowing the Person , it might be of bad Consequences and Arrest , Mrs Rawlins said he has paid me but one Guinea , and I have not given him a Receipt in full . Court . I want to know why the 22d of October , when you was to receive the Money for the Arrest , you put these People into Possession ? Why , after this Agreement that was made , did these two Men go in and nail up the Doors again ? To this there was no satisfactory Answer given . This Gentleman hath said a very strange Expression against this poor Woman . You seem , Sir , to have great Choice of Words , I desire you would not make use of such any more . It is grieving to see such Oppression to those that can not help themselves . Whether Mc Allester or the Lawyer was most her Friend , or whether it would not have been better for her if she had not been acquainted with either of them . And here is two poor Fellows at the Bar , now stand tried for their Lives , when this House was in a Tumult for a Week together , and no Evidence brought against them . Acquitted . The Prisoner ( Goff ) petitioned for a Copy of their Indictment , but it was not granted . 34.

As I was passing he spoke to me first , and I laid hold of him by the Collar , and said , you are the Man that I wanted , I have a Suspicion that you have robbed me ; as I had hold of him , I desired Mr Gold to observe , that he threw nothing of his Pocket ; the Prisoner pulled a Shuttle out of his Pocket , and I took hold of it , and it is the same Shuttle I lost out of my House , and there was a Pair of Pickers picked up by Gold . Q. to - Brown . Do you understand the Nature of an Oath ? Have you learned your Catechism ? Brown , the Father , answers , That his Son was not Book-learned . Court .

My Lord , my Father went out about four o'Clock the 7th of September , about five o'Clock I locked the Shop door , and brought the Key down , and put it in the Kitchen Window . Q . Then you locked the Kitchen-Door ? Brown . Yes , my Lord ; I then carried the Key of the Kitchen to my Father , and came home with him about eight o'Clock , and as I went to Bed , I found the Door broke open ; I called to my Father to come up , but he did not come at the first , and I said , For God 's Sake come up , for the Door is broke open ! When my Father came up , we missed the two Shuttles , and a Pair of Pickers , and the Camblet taken out of the Loom . Q . Was there any body else left in the House ? Brown . The outward Door was left upon the Latch for Gold to come in , that lodged in the House . Richard Gold . As I came Home at Night , between eight and nine o'Clock . I was gone up to Bed ; I hears the Boy cry out Father ! Father ! pray come up , for the Door is broke open ; so he desired I would go with him to see after the Prisoner . We went up to Hoxton to enquire where he lodged ; as we were near Hoxton square , there we met the Prisoner , he spoke first to us , and said I hope no Harm : then Mr Brown said , you are the Man I want , and took hold of him by the Collar , and Brown desired I would look after him , to see that he did not pull any thing out of his Pocket . I saw him take the Shuttle out of his Left-hand Pocket . Q . What then ? Gold . So Mr Brown took hold of it with his Right-Hand ; then we went about 20 Yards , and there was a Pair of Pickers thrown down ; but when he threw them down , I can not say . I picked them up , and Mr Brown said he could swear that that they were his Pickers . The Stuff was delivered to the Constable by Thomas Topham . Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say for yourself ? Prisoner . I worked at his House for about a Week . I went to see for other Work , for fear that should be gone ; coming along Spital Fields , I kick 'd a Sort of a Bundle before me , and picked it up , and brought it Home to my Lodgings ; this Mr Brown , I told him where I lodged . I got to Hoxton , and I did not know him .
