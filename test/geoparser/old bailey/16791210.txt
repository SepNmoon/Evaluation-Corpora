THE NARRATIVE Of the Proceedings at the SESSIONS For London and Middlesex , Begun at the Old-Bailey , on Wednesday the 10th of December , 1679 . GIVING An Account of all the material Tryals there , & c. With the Number and Names of the several persons condemn 'd to die , and their particular Crimes . As also how many burnt in the hand , & c. THe Sessions beginning at the Time and Place above-mentioned , where were present the Right Honourable the Lord Major , the Lord Chief-Justice of England , Sir Robert Atkins , Mr . Recorder , & c. After the Jury were Impannell 'd and Sworn , they proceeded to the Tryal of several Malefactors ; the most remarkable are these that follow . A Fellow for stealing of a Silver-Tankard from the Adam & amp ; Eve , a Victualling-house in Jewen-street , on the Munday before the Lord Major 's day , the manner thus : In the Evening he came in and called for Drink ; but seeming to hide his Face , the Maid-servant of the house had some mistrust of him , and gave an Item thereof to her Master : but bringing the Drink in a Silver-Tankard , took more particular notice of him , which 't is supposed he perceived , and therefore resolved to hasten his Exploits : For pulling a paper of Tobacco out of his Pocket , he bid her fetch Pipes , and as soon as she was gone , poured out the Drink , and with the Tankard got out of the Window ; but made more haste than good speed : for he forgot and left his Tobacco on the Table , and the Paper it was in was a Petition to a Person of Quality , for some Pay due to him in such a Captains Troop , whereby his Name and those Circumstances being discovered , upon enquiry they found him out in the Strand . He stoutly denied that he was ever in the house , or so much as in Jewen-street these six years ; and as to the Paper , that six weeks before this Theft he lost his Almanack , wherein was this Petition , and that some Rogue had found it , and stealing the Tankard , left it there to bring him into trouble . But the Maid swearing positively that he was the man , he was found guilty , and burnt in the hand . Two women were indicted for stealing a Coat out of a shop , where she pretended to buy , and being pursued and taken , charged the next Woman she saw , that she had it from her , who thereupon had the trouble of a Tryal , as being supposed her Confederate ; but appearing now to be a stranger , she was acquitted ; and the other found guilty not onely of this , but another Indictment likewise ; for stealing a Gown . A Young woman was prosecuted by , one she had formerly lived with , for stealing a Gold-Ring set with a Ruby , value 14 l. a Silver Plate , and some other things . The Prosecutor and his Witnesses were Jew s , and so were sworn on the Pentateuch ; the things were taken on the Prisoner , who to excuse her self from being a Thief , acknowledged her self to be a Whore , and told a scandalous story , that the things were privately given her upon a Debauch , & c. Which not being regardable , she was found Guilty . A Man of a very suspicious conversation was tax 'd for Clipping of Money , and there were not a few violent presumptions against him ; a Vintners man swore , that he had often exchang 'd clipt Money for broad , and that once he gave him 4 l. 4 s. for 4 l. for twelve pence in the pound he would allow at any time . And that he saw him rubbing the edges of a new-clipt Half-Crown : Others had received much Clipt-money of him , and he had desired them to let him have large pieces for small , & c. But all this not amounting to any positive Proof , he got off . The matter of greatest value in question this Forenoon , was a late Servant to Squire Hooker , who by false Keys had at several times stollen many Hundred Pounds from his Master ; and not content therewith , descended to steal Napkins , and at last a Pocket-Handkerchief , which being found out by the marks , he was charged with all the rest , though before not suspected , and at last above 1000 l. found where he had hid it . He could not but in effect confess the Fact , and so without examining further circumstances was Convicted . Two Men for stealing of Brandy out of a Cellar were Indicted ; some of it was found in one of their houses ; so he was found Guilty , but the other Acquitted . On Wednesday in the afternoon , there was onely one fellow tryed , but upon two Indictments , both for stealing Tankards out of several Victualling-houses about Convent-garden . The first he took away after the old method , calling for Drink , and whilst the peoples backs were turn 'd , slip away with it . But as for the second he had a cunninger sham : For coming into Company where one at least knew him , their Tankard being almost out , he tasted , and seemed to be in a rage , because they had not drawn him all Ale , which he swore was his onely Drink ; and so snatcht up the Tankard and went away with it down stairs , as pretending to give order for such Liquor as he lov 'd , but went away with the Tankard ; but it being by chance missed very soon after , the rest of the Company several ways pursued him , and took him . He was found guilty , and seemed to be in so weak and sickly a condition , that he was scarce able to go or stand . A Servant-maid was found guilty for stealing a Diamond-Ring and a Locket , and other things of value , which she ran away with ; but being afterwards apprehended , confest the Fact , and acquainted her Master where she had sold them . A Watch-maker [ John Parker ] was convicted of High-Treason , for Counterfeiting of Guineys ; which was positively prov 'd against him by one that had been of his Gang , and swore that he had divers times seen him do it . He had likewise drove a Trade in forging of Duckatoons , and other Forreign Money ; but that being none of the Kings Coyn , he was not charged therewith at present , but onely for the false Guineys which he had made , offered , and put off , to the great abuse and defraudment of his Majesties Subjects . He made a very resolute and subtle defence for himself ; but the matter was evident . Another person was indicted with him , but not much material proved against him , onely that he tendred to put off two naughty Guineys , which he alleadged he had of the other Prisoner ( who did not disown the same ; ) So that he was acquitted . [ Death . See summary . ] Then followed a famous Tryal of a Country-man , living at Edgher in Middlesex , charged with the Murder of his Wife . There were many strong presumptions against him ; as , that they lived untowardly together ; that he had threatned her of late , in case she did not comply with his humour to part with some Estate which he could not dispose of without her . Nor was the manner of her death less suspitious : For he takes her with him on horse-back to Barnet , under some pretences , and in the evening , as they came back , in a lonesome place by a Wood-side , she was kill 'd . He pretends that three Thieves came to rob him , and that she skream 'd out ; which so incensed the Robbers , that one of them knockt her down with so violent a blow , that he then believed it mortal , as afterwards he found : And besides , that they made at her with their Swords . That thereupon he did fight with the Thieves , who cut him , at least his Cloaths ; for he produced his Hat and Coat , which had several gashes , so also had his Stick , which was found by the Body , though many suspected these might be made on purpose ; for himself had no considerable wounds , onely one small hurt on the head , and another on the arm . He further told his Story , that having so destroy 'd his Wife , and master 'd him , two of them forced him into the Wood , and that he saw the third drag his Wife such a way : that they turn 'd his Horse into the Field , and took from himself seven or eight shillings in money , all that he had , and then bound his legs with a string , and his arms behinde him with a piece of the Reyns of his Bridle , and so left him : That with much struggling he got his feet at liberty , but with his hands so bound , went to an house about half a mile off and got them to loose him , though the man that did swore it was so indifferently done , that he believed he might have got them open himself . Whilst this horrid Act was done , there was a man doing some business in a field neer the place , who testifies that he did hear one sudden violent Shriek , and no more noise ; upon which , fearing some mischief might be done , he hollowed five or six times , but received no Answer : And this very man happening to be employed to drive the Cart that carried the Body home , the Prisoner understanding that he was the person that had so been in the said Field , askt him the same Question six times in driving that two or three miles , though he returned him a plain Answer ; which some attributed to the guilty apprehensions and terror of mind , that the Prisoner was then under . When he raised the Countrey , as aforesaid , to seek his Wife , they found her drowned , as well as otherwise Murdered , for she lay in a very obscure place ( which was observed he directed them unto ) near water , in which her Head had been , for her Hoods and upper part of her cloaths were wet ; she had a Wound in her Head , but many that saw it were apt to believe that it was made with a pair of Sizzars , & c. On a full scanning of the matter , there was nothing but Circumstances could be proved , so the Jury acquitted him ; we wish his Conscience may give in the same Verdict . Another was Indicted with him , as being his great Companion , and absent at that time , without being able to give any good or true Account where , & c. but this no man thought sufficient Evidence to Convict him , so that without any difficulty he was discharged . The next day the same persons , by name John Dell and Richard Dean , were tryed for another Murther committed on Daniel Ball , his late Wives Father , a person of Eighty years of age . 'T was proved , that when the old man went thither to live , he expressed his fears that Dell would do him some mischief ; that Dell had prevail 'd with him to make over all his Estate to him ; and frighting him with danger of Arrests , though he ow 'd no man , perswaded him to go to lie at Dean 's , where he dies ( as they say ) without any body being by , and so is put into a Coffin , bespoke by Dell before he was dead ; who also hired a Coach for thirty shillings to come about midnight and bring him to London , where privately they interr 'd him at the Savoy ; and all this secrecy , to prevent the Corps being , forsooth , arrested : But when at the Inne , where the Coach put in at in the Strand , they were told they must have the Searchers , Dell was very unwilling , saying to the Coach-man , there was Blood settled in his face , & c. and perhaps they might make a great business ; and therefore he had a good minde to carry it back again : but at last he admitted the Searchers , who slightly looking on him , return 'd , That he died of an Impostume , with divers other odde things , and contradictions of the two Prisoners in their several Tales . Yet all being still but Circumstances , they were acquitted of this too , as they had also been about a year ago for the Murder of Mrs. Dell 's own Brother , a Tanner , whose body was found in Red-lion-fields . But now comes an Indictment against the same two Companions for stealing a Mare . The owner swore she was stoln such a time from him in Hartfordshire ; a man and his wife swore , and prov 'd by a Copy of the Toll-book , that soon after they bought the same Mare of Dean at such a Fair for twenty six shillings , and that afterwards Dean being questioned , his great friend Mr. Dell owned and declared that it was his Mare , and that he employed him to sell her : And therefore it appearing that they were such bad people , and Confederates , they were both on this found guilty ; God ordering it , that however they brazened out other Crimes , yet they should not at last escape Divine Vengeance . [ Death . See summary . ] One Benjamin Penry , a notorious High-way man , was found guilty of a Felony for stealing a Pistol and two Holland-shirts : the same being found in his Lodging , and it appearing that it was a Robbery on the High-way on Bagshot heath , ( where four of them rifled a Coach , and endangered the Passengers Lives by shooting at them ) he was likewise Condemned to die . A Gentleman belonging to the Life-guard , took a Tryal for killing one in Grays-Inn . 'T was on a fray and sudden heat , they were just before good friends , so it was onely Manslaughter . A wench living at Islington confessing herself with Child seven Months , being put out of her service for that reason , going to her Mothers at Chiswick for about ten or twelve days , returns and offers her service again : whereupon being questioned , owned she had had a Child , and that her Mother had buryed it , & c. For which she and her Mother were Indicted for Murder , but acquitted . There were in all Eleven persons , six men and five women , that received Sentence of Death , whose Names and Crimes are as follow . John Parker , to be Drawn , Hang 'd , and Quartered , being Convicted of High-Treason for Coyning . John Dell , and Richard Dean , to be hang 'd for Felony , for stealing a Mare of twenty six shillings price . These were they that were likewise Tryed for several horrid Murders , as aforesaid . James Rawlins , for stealing a Guelding . Benjamin Penry , a brave stout Overseer of the Highways , and Companion with French hang 'd the last Sessions . William Atkins , Sarah Bonnifeild , Jane Cragg , Anne Syth , Susan White , Deborah Rogers , For several Felonies , being old Offenders . There were also Thirteen burnt in the hand , amongst which was Wood , who robbed his Master of neer 1500 l. And Five ordered to be transported .
