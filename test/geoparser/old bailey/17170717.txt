Ann Hasle , of St. Giles without Cripplegate , was indicted for the Murther of her Male Bastard-Infant , by drowning it in a Copper , the 11th of this Instant July . The Evidences deposed , that Mr. Burton where the Prisoner lived as a Servant , seeing some suspicious Symptoms of her being deliver 'd of a Child , sent for them , being Neighbours ; That when they came , they found the Prisoner sitting in a Chair in the Kitchin ; That they taxed her with her Delivery , but she would not own it ; That they searched all about the House , but could find no Child , though they found some Tokens of such a Matter ; whereupon they pressing her more closely to tell them where the Child was , she told them it was in the Copper , whereupon they searched , and found 2 Gown and Petticoat in a Copper wherein was 8 or 10 Pails of Water , and pulling them out , took out 2 or 3 Pails of Water , and afterwards found the Child at the Bottom of the Copper . A Midwife likewise deposed , the Child was at its full Time ; That examining her as to the Manner of its Birth , she told them that she was delivered in the Chamber , and that she got out of the Bed early in the Morning , spread a Gown and Petticoat on the Floor , lean 'd upon a Chest of Drawers , and the Child came from her upon them ; That there was a young Woman in the Room in Bed , with whom she lay , who was asleep ( she being a Quaker would not swear , and so could be no Evidence ) and that she being very ill , went again to Bed , lay about 3 Hours , and then getting up , was carrying it down Stairs in the Gown and Petticoat , and was met by the Man . The Evidence deposed likewise that the Child was dead , and that there did not appear any Marks upon the Child of its having been hurt any where , except that there was a sort of a blackishCircle about the Child 's Mouth ( which a Midwife likewise deposed was usual to such Infants , tho'dying by a natural Death . ) They likewise deposed that the Child was opened by a Surgeon , and that there did not appear to be any Water in the Body of the Child . In order to the better Information of the Jury in this Case , the Statute was read in Court , which was made to prevent the clandestine Births and concealing the Death of Bastard-Children , which enacted , That the concealing the Birth and Death of Bastard-Children should make the Mothers deem 'd the Murtherers of them . The Prisoner , to put her self out of the Reach of this Act , alledged , that she was a married Woman at the time of her Conception , having been married to one Edward Wingate , who died same time before last Christmas . To prove this she had a Sister in Court , who deposed that she saw her married to the said Edward Wingate at Enfield Church . And others depos 'd , they liv 'd together for some time at Clerkenwell , and that the said Edward Wingate upon his Death-bed expressed his Concern in leaving her six Weeks gone with Child . Tho'in Contradiction to this , the Deceased 's Sister deposed , that she examining the Prisoner since the Commission of this Fact , whether she ever had been married to her Brother , she answered her , she had not . But the other 's Evidence prevailing , she was deemed not to be affected by that Statute . The Matter then turning on another Hinge , it being the Prosecutor 's Business to prove the Child was born alive and that she murthered it . She said it was Still-born , and that she neither perceived it to stir nor heard it to cry , and produc 'd a considerable Quantity of Child-bed Linnen in Court , which was sworn she provided for her Delivery ; and her Sister deposed she spoke to her three Months since to be her Nurse ; and likewise a Midwife deposed , that two Months since , she spoke to her desiring her to come to her when she sent for her , telling her she look 'd the latter End of July or beginning of August . And the chief Stress of the Matter then being whether the Child was murthered by her before putting into the Copper , or alive when she put it in : As to the first , the Evidences generally agreed there were no visible Tokens of any Violence offered to the Infant ; and as to the latter , the Judge being of Opinion it was not alive when it was put in , because of what had been before testified , that at its being opened there was no Water found in the Body of it . A Surgeon being call 'd to give his Opinion on the Matter , confirm 'd his Lordship 's Opinion , deposing upon Oath he was of Opinion that no human Body could be drowned without receiving some Quantity of Water into the Body , and consequently the Child could not be alive when put into the Copper . The Matter being thus , that there was no sufficient Proof that she had either murthered the Infant , or that it was born alive , tho ' the Action was so unaccountably inhuman , for which she gave but little Satisfaction , the Jury acquitted her of the Indictment . Mary Johnson , of St. Andrew Undershaft was indicted for privately stealing 9 s.6 d. in Silver , and 2 d. in Halfpence , from the Person of Lewis Lapparelle the 16th of July last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , that going along the Street near St. Mary Ax about 12 a Clock at Night , the Prisoner met him and hugg 'd him ; that he putting her from him , put his Hand in his Pocket and missed his Handkerchief ; whereupon he taxed the Prisoner with taking it , upon which she pointed to it lying on the Ground , and while he was stooping to take it up she was making off , whereupon he feeling for his Money missed that too ; he therefore pursued her and took her , and a Watchman coming they carried her to the Watch-house , and searching her found the very same Money , and no more , in one of her Pockets . The Watchman confirm 'd the same . However the Prisoner deny 'd the Fact , and the Jury acquitted her . Mary Jones , of St. Botolph 's Bishopsgate , was indicted for breaking the Dwelling-house of William Kendal in the Day-time , and stealing a Chintz Gown and Petticoat , value 25 l. a Sarsenet-Hood , Muslin Aprons , and other Goods , the Property of Richard Hadley , the 13th of June last . The Evidence deposed , that going into a Room to dress her Head , she perceived something to move the Bedcloaths ; so running out of the Room she locked the Door after her and called some to her Assistance , and that as she was going she heard the Door unlock 'd . Other Evidence deposed , that searching all the House over , they found the before mention 'd Goods , and some others , moved out of their Places in order to carry away , but could find no body , till going into the Garret they found the Prisoner hid in the Chimney behind some Boards , and searching her found a Muslin Apron , a Sarsenet-Hood , and a Ribbon in her Pocket , which were Madam Hadley 's . The Prisoner deny 'd the Fact , and said she only went in there to hide herself from some Officers she saw who would have arrested her . This indeed appeared but a Pretence ; but there being not sufficient Proof how she came into the House , and Madam Hadley being gone to Plimouth , or somewhere by Sea , and not being there to swear to the Goods found upon her , she had the good Fortune to escape at this time , being acquitted by the Jury . Daniel Tennier , of St. Buttolph 's Bishopsgate , was indicted for breaking the dwelling House of Hannah Stamford in the Night-time , and stealing from thence two Silver Spoons , value 15 s. a Silver Fork , value 5 s. two Holland Sheets , value 20 s. one Pound weight of Silk , value 25 s. and 25 s. in Money , the Property of Hannah Stamford , and 2 Holland Shirts , value 30 s. the Property of Thomas Motley , the 22d of June last . Hannah Stamford deposed , that he being provided by his Gang with a Ladder and Rope , got in at her Casement-Window when no body was in the House , and set a Bar against the Door that no body might come in to interrupt him , and having stollen the Goods , got out at the Back-Window by the help of a Rope . Thomas Motley deposed , that he took the Prisoner with one of his Shirts upon his Back . Another Evidence deposed , that the Prisoner had owned the taking of the Shirts , and 10 s.6 d. in Money . The Prisoner in Court owned the Fact in part , that he did go in at the Window as had been testified , and took the Shirts and 10 s.6 d. but pleaded it was no Robbery , in that it was his own House , and he only took what was his own , saying that the Prosecutor was his Wife 's Mother , who skreen 'd her Daughter to live in an adulterous manner with the said Thomas Motley , who had ruined him , had thrown him into the Marshalsea with a sham Action , kept him there 16 Weeks , and that the Night they knew he would come out of Prison , they got out of the House , and locked it up that he might not get in ; That he had brought home 60 l. and his Wife and the said Thomas Motley had made it all away and ruined him ; and that when he went away he left 6 good Shirts , and took the 2 he carried away to be his own , and that as for the Money , he took it out of his Wife 's Snuff-box . All this was amply confirmed by the Neighbourhood , and much more , who deposed that he did not do this privately , but before Scores of the Neighbours who advised him to it , they adding , that Thomas Motley had , when the Prisoner had come home to his Wife , beaten him in a very barbarous manner , and that Motley had a Wife of his own at Deptford , but used to leave his own Bed to turn the Prisoner out of his , and lie with his Wife . Others gave the Prisoner a very good Character , and added , he had been the most abused that any Man was ; whereupon the Jury acquitted him . William Crew , of St Sepulchres , was indicted for Stealing a Gold Ring , value 15 s. from Sarah Bellamy , the 16th of July . The Prosecutor deposed , the Prisoner had courted her for his Wife , but she having heard he had a Wife , had refused him ; That she going into the Country , had intrusted him with a Box of Cloaths to send after her , but that he had detained the Ring . There was not Proof sufficient , so the Jury acquitted him .

Robert Thompson deposed , that he having been sent to carry the Linnen to wash , the Prisoner came to him near St. Dunstan 's Church , and offered him Twopence to carry a Ring to a certain Tavern hard by ( the Name he could not remember ) but he not being willing , he told him he would give him Sixpence to carry it , telling him he must deliver the Ring to his young Mistress , telling him he would hold his Linnen while he came back , for fear he should go away with the Ring , but that he not carrying the Ring upon that Condition , went on his Way ; That the Prisoner followed him , knocked him down over against St. Dunstan 's Church , took his Linnen and ran away . Richard Saunder 's deposed , that he coming along seeing the Boy lying on the Ground , crying out for his Linnen , espied the Prisoner making off , followed him , and seised him with the Linnen under his Arm , then committed him to the Watch .

Sir Isaac depos 'd , that being at his House near Colchester , his Daughter sending him word he was robbed he came to London , and suspecting the Prisoner he examin 'd him about it , and he told him he believed the Thieves came down the Chimney ; but upon examining the Footboy he disclos 'd the whole Matter : Whereupon he apprehended the Prisoner , who acknowledg 'd it before the Justice ; and the Examination was read in Court , many of the Things were had again , procured by the Prisoner 's Wife 's Direction .

The Goods were taken upon the Prisoner going to sell them ; she pleaded a Boy gave her them to sell for his Mother , who was in great Distress , telling her she should have something for her pains . But this was not believed , the Jury therefore found her Guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] Mary Scyas , of St. Giles 's Cripplegate , was indicted for feloniously stealing a Callicoe Gown val.20 s. the Property of Thomas White , the 8th of June last . The Prosecutor deposed he took the Prisoner with the Gown in her Apron . The Prisoner pleaded a Woman bid her stay to buy some Goods , and she went into the House and had it of her . But this Excuse did not suffice , the Jury found her guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] Thomas Middle , of St. Ann 's Westminster , was indicted for assaulting Thomas Rutherford on the King 's High Way , and taking from him three Diaper Table Cloths , value 16 s. Six Napkins , val.6 s. the Property of Peter Labbatosh , the 2d of July last . The Prosecutor deposed he was stopped and robbed by four Persons at the end of Dean-street going into Tybourn Road , that he followed the Prisoner and the Persons who robbed him as fast as he could , crying out to stop them , and that John Santeloe was taken with the Goods upon him . John Santeloe deposed , that himself , the Prisoner , Francis Raven and another Person did the Fact . He being the principal Criminal on whom the Goods were found , the Court not thinking fit to convict the other upon his single Testimony , therefore acquitted him . John Chandler , of St. Buttolph 's Aldgate , was indicted for marrying a second Wife , his first being alive : But the Fact being committed before the Commencement of the Act of Grace , he was not try 'd , but acquitted . William Fuller , commonly known by the Name of Evidence Fuller , or ( as he stiles himself ) Colonel Fuller , was not try 'd this Sessions , as it was expected , for two notorious Cheats committed by him , by reason the Prosecutors did not appear ; but however is continued in Newgate till the next Sessions . Thomas Smith , try 'd last Sessions for contriving and abetting Williams and Chessey in robbing the Mail , who was to have been try 'd this Sessions for a Forgery , made an Affidavit that several material Evidences for him were in the Country , and he could not procure them , desiring therefore his Tryal might be deferred till the next Sessions , knowing that the Gentleman who prosecuted him for the Forgery , had come twice from Salisbury on purpose , and was now in Town , and had been at a considerable Charge to have his Evidences ready : But the Prosecutor bringing Proof that one of the Persons whom he called his material Evidence was in Town but two Days before , and had been serv 'd with a Subpoena from him , the Court would not admit the putting off the Tryal , unless he paid him down the Expenses he had been at in attending two Sessions upon him , and to find satisfactory Bail till the next , which he agreed to do ; but instead of that staid till the Tryals were over , and then came and pretended he would take his Tryal . The Court seeing through the Shuffle would not be trick 'd by him , but he trick 'd himself the next way into Newgate . Panton the Weaver , who was indicted for a Misdemeanour in uttering a great Number of light Gaineas which had been filed , had his Tryal suspended on account of an Indictment of High Treason found against him for the same Fact , for which he is to be try 'd at Kingston , the Fact having been committed in Surrey .

WE Charles and Mary Pearce , who keep the Derby Alehouse in White-horse-yard in Kingstreet , Westminster , do hereby affirm , that our Child was so very ill with its Teeth , that it lay ( as we thought and expected in Sorrow and Tears ) ready to expire . We sent for the ANODINE NECKLACE , Recommended by Dr. Chamberlen , sold at the Golden Key over against the King 's Arms Tavern in Kingstreet , Westminster , and put it about its Neck : It had not wore it above half an Hour , but the Child got up upon his Feet to play , to our great Amazement , and has ever since so visibly recover 'd and thriv 'd that thro ' God 's Blessing he is now a brave healthy lusty Boy ; of the Truth of which we are ready to satisfy any Person that desires it . July 16,1717 . For the Good of the Publick . WHereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex , in this Kingdom , have contracted an evil Habit of Body , wherein the vicious Humours , at first dispers 'd thro ' the Whole , comeat length to be lodg 'd in one Part or another , and many times , for Causes too long to be here mentioned , are thrown down upon the Womb , occasioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part , which being neglected , at last turns Cancerous , and often proves Fatal . I cure the Diabetes when gives over by all other Persons . This is to acquaint all such as may have occasion , that a speedy Relief is to be had from an Experienc 'd Midwife , dwelling at the Sign of the Queen 's Arms , a Watch-Makers , near Exeter Exchange in the Strand , who perform 'd a Cure upon a Lady at the Bath , after she was given over by the Physicians , and since has Cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and Suburbs of London . I should not have put my self in Publick Print , but to satisfy the Afflicted where they may have present Ease and Relief . THE most excellent BALSAMICK WATER , being the greatest Preservative of Health in Nature , that in 50 Years Study of Physick I could find out , needs not much to be said in its Commendation , for it will recommend it self ; and I have no other Interest in making of it Publick , but for the Satisfaction of my Friends , and the general Good of Mankind , and that it may not die with me . I do n't ( like the English Quack ) say that it cures all Distempers ; but it infallibly keeps the Body in good Health , and defends it from all infections Airs and distempers , by taking 3 Spoonfuls of it in half a Pint of warm Ale , a Glass of White Wine , Tea , or any other Liquid . It may be taken by all Persons , of what Age or Sex soever , at any time of the Day , without Consinement or Hinderance of Business , according to the printed Directions given with it . It prevents Consumptions , and cures them if not too far gone ; it relieves she Tissick and Shortness of Breath ; cures Ulcers in the Lungs , or in any part of the Body ; it opens all Obstructions , and infallibly destroys all sorts of Worms in Young or Old . It cares the Yellow and Black Jaundice , Leprosy , Itch , and Scald Heads . It certainly eradicates that reigning Distemper the Scurvey ; chears the Spirits , strengthens the Stomach , and creates a good Appetite . I recommend it to all Child-bearing Women , it preserving the Infant from those Infirmities that Children are generally afflicted with , purifies the whole Mass of Blood , renders the Skin beautiful and clear , and causes easy Delivery . Likewise I recommend it to Sea-faring Men that Trade to the East or West Indies , or those Countries where Fevers or the Piague are infections . When all other Remedies fail , this excellent Balsamick Water drives out the Small Pox or Measles , and keeps them from the Stomach or Throat , preventing that Soreness which generally accompanies , and often proves fatal in that Distemper ; and also prevents the Small Pox or any other infections Distemper , from spreading in a Family . It 's excellent for Gentlemen after hard Drinking , far exceeding any thing ; it discharges the Body from the Impurity of bad Wine , and cleanses it from all Scorbutick Spots , Scabs , or Boyls , by bathing outwardly ; and cures all Old Sores and Green Wounds , by washing the Place with it ; and all sorts of sore Mouths caused by inward Heat or Canker . It is also excellent for all Persons that drink the Waters , causing them to pass and evacuate whatever Humours offend the Body . This excellent Balsamick Water is put up in half Pint Bottles , at 2 s.6 d. each Bottle , with Directions at large for the Taking and use of it , which being close stopp 'd , retains its Virtue in all Climates ; for the older it grows , the better it is : It generally gives one Stool , and works off by Urine . This excellent Balsamick Water is made by none but my self ; and , to prevent Counterfeits , is sold only at Mr. Parker 's , Book-seller , at the Bible and Crown in Lambord-Street , near Stocks-Market , sealed with a Liew and Dagger .
