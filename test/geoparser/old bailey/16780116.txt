The Proceedings at the Sessions for London and Middlesex . THe first remarkable Tryal at this Sessions was of a woman for murthering her Bastard child . The Evidence proved that she confess 'd her self to be with Childe ; that afterwards a Childe was found dead in the street : That she acknowledg 'd she had been deliver 'd of a Childe , but that certain woman had taken it from her . But she was not able to produce any of those women , and so was found guilty , and must expect the punishment of Death awarded by Law to such Unnatural offenders . After this , followed the Tryal of two notorious Highway-men , taken on Christmas day last at Whetstone neer Barnet in Middlesex . There was very plain Evidence of their robbing a Coach , and of a Country-man , & c. and several Goods , as silver Boxes , a Laydies Tower , & c. were taken with them , and produced in Court ; which made it a Felony in this County : And the same appearing to be a Robbery on the Highway in Bark-shire , by the Statute the Prisoners wereexempted from the benefit of Clergy , and being found guilty by the Jury , received sentence of Death ; upon which the Court declared , That there were at least seventeen or eighteen Robberies lay upon their heads , and some Murders , particularly the Grasier at Watford gap , kill 'd by one in their company , and as 't is fear 'd , by one of their hands . A woman , of very ill fame , having a Quarrel with one of her Companions who struck her , after an hour and a halfs respit , returned , and with a pair of Tongs striking at her over another woman shoulder , happen 'd to beat out the brains of a Childe her female-antagonist held in her arms . For this she was indicted for Murder ; but upon a long debate , was onely convicted of Manslaughter ; for which Clergy being not grantable to her Sex , she was condemned . A person was arraigned for Murder , but it appeared upon the whole matter to be upon a Challenge betwixt two Gentlemen and their Seconds who met in the Fields , and there unhappily the friend of the Prisoner was kill 'd by one of the other two , who are neither of them to be found . The Quarrel being such , and a Duel premeditated , the Case appeared somewhat difficult whether Murder or Manslaughter , and so it was left upon a Special Verdict . An old Offender being indicted for stealing of several Clothes and Linnen in St. Andrews Holborn , confessed the Fact , and was burnt in hand . The two before mentioned Highway-men were next day indicted again for stealing of a Mare ; which was taken amongst the rest of their horses at Whetstone , and was now owned by a Gentleman 's Servant in Sommerset-shire , from whom she had been formerly stolen ; but they obstinately denying the Fact , and alleadging that she belonged to , and was brought in thither by a little black man , whom they were strangers to , though supposed to be one of their Companions that then escaped , and no positive proof appearing against them , they were upon this Indictment acquitted . A Shoomaker was Convicted for Clipping the Kings Coin ; the manner of his being discovered and apprehended , was thus : The Landlord coming to take Possession of the house wherein the Prisoner and a woman that has often been suspected to be concern 'd in such Practices lodged , she being abroad and her Chamber-door lock 'd , seeing them resolv 'd to go in , told them he would try to open it ; and so pulling out a Key , did open the said door , and went directly and hastily to a Closet , where he was observ 'd with both his hands to sweep down certain Instruments and fling them into a private corner , and then cast a Cushion over them to conceal them : Whereupon the said Landlord seeming to take no notice thereof , went down and acquainted the Tenant , who knew nothing thereof ; but together they sent for a Constable , seized the Prisoner , and in his Trunk found aFile , but in the other Chamber under the said Cushion , several Clippings and Filings of Silver , a Sixpence newly clipp 'd , a pair of Shears , two or three Crucibles for melting down , and a quantity of Silver ready melted , & c. which were now produced in Court . He peremptorily denied any concernment in the Fact ; but his having a Key to her Room ; his running to the Closet and endeavouring to conceal the things , & c. caused him to be brought in guilty of the Treason ; and was condemn 'd to be Drawn and Hang 'd . A French man lodging in a womans house , and having been seen once or twice in his Landladie s Chamber , where he had nothing to do , and she afterwards missing three Gold Rings and several other things , charged him therewith , and caused him to be committed ; though he denied it , yet at last they were found hid in the Chamber where he lay , about his bed . The Prisoner being not able to speak English , was allow 'd an Interpreter , and brought a witness that the Prosecutress confest she went to a Cunning man somewhere behinde St. Clements , who described another person , and promised that she should finde her things again in her house , & c. However , he was convicted , and treated by Squire Ketch with an Ardent mark of his Affection . A person formerly transported , was indicted for breaking open a shop in Cheapside , and stealing Ribbons and other Commodities to the value or Fifty pounds . He had partly confess'dthe matter heretofore , saying , he fear 'd nothing so much as the ugly business of Cheapside ; and told one , that he open 'd the door with a Betty , which he had thrown over such a wall ; where search being made , it was found , and now produced in Court . Upon the whole matter he was found guilty , but another indicted with him acquitted . Being question 'd about his return after transportation , he alleadged several frivolous excuses , and that he was now just ready to have gone a Voyage to Barbadoes . He had in effect very little to say for himself , but with the rest received sentence of Death . A woman taking a Lodging by a wrong name , in the absence of her Landlady broke open the door and stole several Clothes , which were taken upon her : She was found guilty , and condemned . A Maid-servant arraigned for stealing a Hood and a Bible from one of her Master 's neighbours . As to the Hood she proved that she found it in her Master 's Chamber , and wore it a great while publickly , being never question 'd till she came to demand her Wages ; which made it suspected that there was more passion than matter in the Prosecution , and so she was discharged . So likewise was a person charged with stealing about Fourteen pounds worth of Leather ; there being no exact proof against him , but several Circumstances , as former Prosecution , & c. that made in favour of his acquittal . A person arraigned for a Robbery on theHigh-way , in the quality usually call 'd , The Foot-pad , and stealing of Goods to the value of eleven shillings , of which part were found in his Lodging ; and the Party robb 'd swore , That he verily believed him to be the man , that took them away from him . Last Sessions he was Indicted for the like Crime , but favourably brought in not guilty ; now being Convicted , he received Sentence of Death . There were in all Thirteen Persons that received Sentence of Death , viz . Three for robbing on the High-way , one for Treason , one Woman for Murder , and another for Manslaughter , three Men for Burglaries , and four Women for House-breaking and notorious Felonies : of which two were old Offenders , that had often been Convicted heretofore . Besides these , there were Nine Men burnt in the Hand , and Three sentenced to be Whipt : The Woman attainted last Sessions for Treason , who pleaded her Belly , is not yet delivered ; but hath ( as was declared in Court ) since endeavoured to break Prison . The other Highway men , in custody , are to be carried the Circuit : The rest of the Proceedings , as less remarkable , we purposely omit .
