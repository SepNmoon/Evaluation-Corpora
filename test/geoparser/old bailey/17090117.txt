She was a 2d time Indicted upon the Coroners Inquest , for the Murder of the Persons aforesaid . It appear 'd that on Sunday the 2d Instant the Prisoner came to a Parish Nurses , and sat down by the Fire ; That she was observ 'd to take something out of her Pocket , and convey it into a Ladle half fill 'd with Broth , stirring it about with her Finger , and put it into the Porridge-Pot then upon the Fire . The Family not knowing what was done , eat of the Broth to the Number of 15 , which in an hour or two were taken with Vomiting ; it wrought to that degree upon the 2 deceas 'd Persons , that they died the Day following . It appear 'd that the Prisoner had been with severalApothecaries on the first Instant to buy Rats Bane , and could not get any ; that at last she succeeded , but would not discover where she had it . She confess 'd that her intent of getting it was to Poyson her self , but was prevented by the Woman , who she thought see her put it into the Ladle ; and it did not appear that she had any Design upon the Persons that took it .

It was prov 'd plainly that the Prisoner had such a Child , that she took her out with her , and that it hath not been seen since ; so that her own Confession , was sufficient Proof of the Fact . But in her Defence it appear 'd plain that she had for a considerable time been under a great trouble of Mind , and in a disponding Condition ( for Misfortunes relating to her Family ) that she would commit many extravagant Actions , and particularly when she lay In three Months ago , would rise out of her Bed and Dance about the Room ; which Disorders of Mind continu 'd upon her ever since . It further appear 'd , that her Mother was for several Years under those unhappy Circumstances , and look 'd upon as a Lunatick at the Birth of the Prisoner . It was likewise prov 'd that the Prisoner was an affectionate Mother to her Child , and that what she had done she said , was to prevent its being miserable in this World . Several Persons of good Credit depos 'd that the Prisoner in her Senses was a very sober , discreet Person , not given to any kind of Vice . Upon the whole , the Jury acquitted her .

Charles Conly , was Indicted for privately stealing from the Person of Richard Morrice , a silver Watch , Chain and Seal , value 6 l. the Goods of the said Richard Morrice , on the 26th of November last . It appear 'd that as the Prosecutor pass 'd by the Prisoners Door , the Prisoner engag 'd him to come into his Brandy Shop , and ask 'd him to drink a Dram ; the Prosecutor consented , and the Prisoner Hug 'd and Kiss 'd him , and was more than ordinary kind , but as soon as he was out of the Prisoners House he miss 'd his Watch , which he pull 'd out in the Shop , at the request of the Prisoner , to tell him what was a Clock . It appear 'd there was no Body near the Prosecutor but the Prisoner , who being a Man of an ill Character , and the Circumstances very plain , the Jury found him Guilty of Felony . [ Branding .

The Evidence to the first Indictment depos 'd , that on the 14th of December in the Night time a Breach was made in the Prosecutors Brick House , so large that a Man might enter ; and the Goods mention 'd taken away . It appear 'd by the Evidence to the 2d Indictment , that Mr. Moss 's House was broken after the manner of the former , and the Goods gone : And searching the Prisoners House upon Suspition , part of the Goods of both the Prosecutors were found ; and the Prisoners giving no good Account how they came by them , the Jury found Henry Halson Guilty of both Indictments , but acquitted his Wife .
