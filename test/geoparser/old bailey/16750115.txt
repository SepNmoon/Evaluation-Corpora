LONDON , Printed in the 1674 A True and Perfect Narrative of the Proceedings at the General Session of the Peace holden for London and Middlesex , upon the 15th and 16th of January instant . IT would be neither easy to the Wrighter , nor very satisfactory to the readers of these remarques , to have a precise account given of every particular business at the Sessions , in every of which , are tryed so many Petty felonies , and other common offences as would be little worth the observation of those that should read them , theobjects of mens curiosityes being things rare and portentous , and not common and Vulgar ; I shall therefore pretermit ( in this narrative ) those tryalls that were of less note , and consequence and only give you an account of those that were most remarkable at this Sessions . And they were in three notorous mischances , first of a Barbarous Murther acted by an unnatural Mother upon her own Child . 2. for a Villanous Robery committed by a Treacherous Servant upon his Master . Thirdly of a brutish act of beastliness done by a petulant Letcher upon the Person of a Child . The first of these was a Woman of the Parish of St. Martins in the fields , a Married Woman , and one whose Husband is accounted a Person of good repute , and credit , and with him she lived , to the seeming of those that know them , contentedly and well , it pleased God ( whose Judgments are unaccountable to his Creatures ) so for to suffer the Devil to prevail upon this poor wretch , as to cause her to perpetrate that horrid action whereof she was not indicted . The fact upon the Evidence given into the Court appeared to be thus ; this woman had ( not long before the fact ) been delivered of the Child , which she after Murthered , and was then but newly Siting up after her labour , she was observed for some time before to be some what discomposed and distempered in her mind ; the ground of which is Variously reported but not certainely known , but was so far taken notice off , that those that were about her were feareful at any time to leave her alone , and it had been well if they had continued true to their own feares The day whereon this tragedy was acted , this unnatural Mother Orders her Nurse to make her a Sea-Coal fire in her Chamber , and to blow it up well pretending she was cold ; this being done , she sends the aforesaid Nurse upon some arrand out of doores ; and then takes her little Infant in her hands , and having first opened a place in the top of the fire , by removing some of the Cools , she cruelly thrust the poor Innocent into it , and then threw the Coals upon it , where it was burned to Death ; A little while after the Nurse returning and perceiving some of the Child cloths upon the fire , snatching to take them off , caught hold of some part of the Child that was not then consumed , whereupon Surprized with the horror of the sight , she shreikt out and askt who had done it , which the Cruel Mother presently confessed to be her self , and was thereupon taken into the hands of Justice , and at this Sessions tryed for her Life , as I have before told you , she was at last Cleared by the Jury who juded her not to be of sound mind before , and at the time of doing the fact , and therefore brought her in not Guilty . The next tryal of remarke was that of the Merchants Servant , one Rookewood Servant to one Mr. Rowland Lee the Elder a Marchant of London , he was arraigned upon two severall Indictments ; the one of a felony , for Robing his said Master of several Sumes of money in all to the value of 3000 Pound , the other of Feloney and Burglary for breaking up the House of his said Master , and Felonious takeing away of 210 Pound of the moneyes of Rowland Lee the younger . The first Indictments for Felonious taking away of the 3000 Pound , he Pleaded Guilty ; To the 2 Indictment , whereupon ( besides the Feloney ) he was indicted of Burglary which he might know was a Crime that exempted him from the benefit of Clergy he was so much a friend to himself as to put himself upon his Tryal by Pleading not Guilty . Upon his Tryal upon this second Indictment it was proved against him by the Attestation of Several Witnesses , that Mr. Rowland Lee the Younger Sojourning in his Fathers house and having a Little Room therein for the keeping of his account , the Prisoner being then Servant to his Father took his opportunity when the said Mr. Lee was one day out of Town , broke into the said Room , and thence took a way the aforesaid 20 Pound . The fact was Clearly proved against , him both by Witnesses and his own confession in a letter of his own wrighting , which was read in Court , and wherein he owned the fact , and said moreover , that he stole the key wherewith he opened the door out of the said Mr. Lees Pocket ; but the witnesses tonement varyed in their Evidence as to that , whether the said doore was broken open or opened by a key . There was some dispute in the Court whither the Indictments was well laid for the burglary , for that the fact although the same yet related to several persons the house that was broken open being Mr. Rowland Lees the Elder , and the Money that was taken away was Mr. Rowland Lees the younger , and therefore it was advised whither another Bill should not be drawn up to indict him severally of the burglary , but this Court not being agreed upon ; the whole matter was left to the Jury , who brought him in guilty upon the first Indictment by his own Confessions , and upon the Second they at first brought him in not guilty , but the Court not being satisfied with that Verdict they went out again and brought in a Special Verdict , which is to be argued at another time . There was a woman at the same time tryed for being accessary with the said Rookewood , And receiving the monyes that he had Stollen ; But although it appeared to the Court that she was a person likely enough to be guilty of such a crime , yet no direct Evidence coming in against her , she was acquitted . [ Branding . See summary . ] The next was one Edward Coker who stood indicted for the ravishing of a Child of 11 yeares old , the Child was there and gave her Evidence in Court that the said Coker coming into her Aunts house where she lived , did get her into a Room and did there force her : The Ant attested that she hearing the Child cry out , came into the Room where he was in the dark with her , and found by evident tokens that the Child had bin abused , but although the fact appeared very foul against him yet the Circumstances thereto not being so direct as to prove a Rape , according as the law directs on those case , he was brought in not guilty upon that Indictment , but that he might not go Scot-free the Court directed another Bill to be drawn up for an Assault upon the said Child , which Bill was found , and upon his tryal thereupon was found guilty , and was fined 25 Markes by the Court for his offence . There was also tryed the Bayliff that killed his fellow Bayliff at Soehoe , he was found guilty of Murther [ Death . See summary . ] The Merchants Servant had the Allowance of his clergy and was burned in the hand , together with 5 other . There are Seven men are all condemned to Die whereof the aforesaid Bayly was one . And 8 to be Whipt at the Carts Tayle .
