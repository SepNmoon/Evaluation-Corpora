The Prisoner was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . William Bird . On the 30th of November at Six in the Evening , the Prisoner was set Sentinel , at the Chappel Door , at Somerset House . Hearing that he had committed some outrageous Facts upon his Post , I went down to take him . But he said to me , Damn ye keep off , or I 'll be your Butcher . As I knew him to be a mischievous Fellow I proceeded no farther . At ten a Clock the same night the Deceased Richard Rowe , who was Corporal , brought a Regular Relief . The Prisoner said , who is there ? The Deceas 'd answered , Relief . The Prisoner said , Damn ye stand off , or I 'll shoot ye . Presently after which I heard the Piece go off , and the Deceas 'd fell down dead . Then the Prisoner clubbed his Firelock , and struck at these Men . I kick 'd up his Heels , and put him in Irons - He was alone on his Post till the Deceased came to relieve him - Here 's the Deceased 's Wastcoat - Here the Bullet went in , at the third Button-hole on the Breast - And here it came out at the the right Shoulder . Prisoner . I am not guilty of what I have done - As to loading my Piece at 10 o'Clock , it was by a particular Order - Who came for Relief ? Did you bring 7 Men or 3 ? Bird . Three ; the Deceased , and these two , Henry Thomas , and Richard Godson . Prisoner . What did I say to the Corporal ? Bird . You said , Pass your Relief . Prisoner . I did so , and then they crowded in upon me , and in strugling my Piece went off - Richard Godson . When we came to relieve the Prisoner , he asked Who comes there ? The Corporal answered Relief . Gentlemen , God damn ye , says the Prisoner , stand off ! for the first Man that comes to oppose me , I 'll shoot thro ' the Body . The Corporal bid us advance , and we went under the Piazza 's . The Prisoner turned towards him , and said , Row , stand off ! or you 're a dead Man . And then his Piece went off : And the Deceased ( who was at that time about the Distance of two Firelocks from the Prisoner ) went with a wheel this way , and fell on his Side . The Bullet enter 'd at his Breast , and came out at his Shoulder , and he died on the Spot . The Prisoner club 'd his Firelock , struck at me , and wounded me in the Head . Prisoner .

God damn ye , says the Prisoner , stand off with your Relief - or Row , you 're a dead Man . The Deceas 'd bid me recover my Piece , and relieve him ; when immediately I saw the Prisoner present his Piece , and heard it go off , and the Deceased fell down dead . Then the Prisoner clubb 'd his Piece and struck at me thrice , and at the third Blow he broke the Stock of my Firelock ; and , had it not been for that , I believe the Blow had killed me . Prisoner . You are sure of all this ? Was you under the Piazza ? Thomas . Yes . Prisoner . Did not I desire the Corporal to let me bide in my Place ? Thomas Adcock . I was Sentry under the Gate-way : The Relief came at Ten o'Clock . The Prisoner asked who went there , and was answered , Relief . Pass the Relief , says he , and then they went under the Piazzas . The Prisoner bid the Deceased stand off , and threatned to fire if he did not . The Deceased bid the Men rest their Firelocks , and then bid them recover their Pieces and relieve him , when presently I heard the Piece go off . Prisoner .

Peter Hughs , of St. Martins in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , value 5 l. 2 Silver Porringers , value 40 s. a Silver Soup-Spoon , value 30 s. a Silver Punch-Ladle , value 10 s. 12 Silver Spoons , value 6 l. and 5 Silver Tea-Spoons , value 8 s. the Goods of Charles Sims , in his House , November 18 . And , 6. Susan Strafford of St. Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for receiving a Silver Tankard , 2 Silver Porringers , and 4 Silver Spoons , part of the said Goods , knowing them to have been stolen . Charles Sims . I keep the Red Lyon-Inn at Charing-Cross : The Prisoner , Hughs , was my Servant , he had lived with me about 3 Weeks . On the 18th of November I went to Bed between 8 and 9 at Night ; the Prisoner , Hughs , was then in the House , my Plate always used to be lock 'd up in a Closet in the Parlor : My Wife came and told me that my Man Hughs was gone away , and the Plate was missing ; but the Closet-Door was lock 'd : I got out of Bed , called a Coach , and went to look for him , to no Purpose . I had seen the other Prisoner Strafford once in his Company at my House , and therefore suspected that she might be concerned with him ; at last I thought if I could meet with her I might by that means hear of him : So next Morning , understanding that some Lawyet in an Alley in Chancery-Lane was acquainted with her , I went to a Chandler 's Shop there , and made Enquiry ; but all I could learn was , That she sometimes drank a Dram there : I advertised my Goods , and next Day Word was sent me that she was taken with most of the Plate upon her . John Chitty . On the 19th of November , as I was drinking after Dinner at Richard Slaters at the Horse shoe and Chequer on Snow-Hill , the Prisoner , Strafford , came in with a Parcel of Plate bundled up in a Napkin in her Lap ; she open 'd it , and desired Mrs. Slater to let her have some Money upon it . I privately advised 'em to send for 2 Constable and Charge her , because I thought she did not come honestly by it ; but they would not , and so she went away with it . Mr. Bains , and the Prosecutor 's Landlord , told me next Day that such Plate was Advertised . Upon which we went to enquire for her at a Silk-Dyers in Spittle-Fields , Mr. Barns having heard that she had lived there ; but when we came thither , we were told that she had been gone from thence above 4 Months We went away thro ' some Back-Alleys into Shoreditch , where we accidentally met her with a Piece of Linnen under her Arm . I stopp 'd her , and said , Madam , I am glad to see ye ! She asked what Business we had with her . We told her she should soon be satisfy 'd , and so we took her to the Swan Tavern in Shoreditch ; Mr. Earns and the other Man went for a Constable , and charged him with her on Suspicion of being concerned in stealing the Plate . She directed us to Pet . Hughs 's Lodging , which was at the Crooked-Billet , hard-by . The Constable went and fetched him , and as soon as she saw him she curs 'd and damn 'd him for a Son-of-a-Bitch for bringing her into such a Premunire . Peter took 4 or 5 Tea-Spoons out of his Pocket , and gave them to the Constable . We went again to Peter 's Lodging to see what we could find . Strafford pulled out the Drawer of a Trunk , from whence she took this Silver Tankard , 2 Porringers and a Punch-Ladle , and deliver 'd them to the Constable : Then we all took Coach to the Prosecutor 's House , where Peter owned that he had taken that Plate out of his Master 's House . Peter . I never saw the Plate till I saw it in her Hands . Then Peter 's Confession before Justice Deveil was proved and read in Court . He there in confesses , that he stole the Plate [ mentioned in the Indictment ] out of his Master Charles Sims 's House ; and says , that she , Susan Strafford , put him upon stealing it , and afterwards received it from him . Thomas Barns . I heard that Strafford had been offering to pawn the Plate to Mrs. Slater , and that she sold some of it the same Evening to a Silversmith . I went next Day to Mrs. Slater , who told me the Plate was advertised : I remembred that Strafford had some time ago ( I forget upon what Occasion ) left Word that she lived at a Silk-Dyers in Slaughter-street in Spittle-Fields . I , and two more , went thither ; where we were told , she had been gone a pretty while from that Place ; but in going back , we met with her by Chance in Shoreditch , and carry 'd her to a Tavern , where we examin 'd her about the Plate . She said she had it out of the Country , and defy 'd the World to touch her Honour . Look ye , says I , It signifies nothing to deny it , for that very Plate which you offered to pawn to Mrs. Slater is advertised - It is By-God ? Says she , Then that Rogue Hughs has brought me into a fine Scrape . By her Directions we found Hughs and he gave 5 Tea Spoons to the Constable , and confess 'd that he took the Plate from his Master , and that she was not with him when he did it . Mr. Davis , a Goldsmith by Holborn Bridge , deposed , That he bought some Silver Spoons of her , and paid her a moderate Price . Mr. Fernell deposed , That he bought 2 Spoons of her . Susan Strafford . When Hughs first came out of the Country , he lodged at Mr. Newnham 's , the Blue-Boar in High Holborn - He came to me one Day , and said that he had got some Plate that was sent him out of the Country by some Relation , and that it was in the Box where his Clothes were ; but he owed Mr. Newnham some Money for Drink and Lodging , and therefore Mr. Newnham had stopp 'd his Box . He came to me next Day and brought a Silver Spoon which he desir 'd me to sell for him ; telling me , that Newnham having given him leave to take a Shirt out of the Box , he found Means to take the Spoon unperceived . So we sold the Spoon for 11s . and hearing that the Prosecutor wanted a Servant , he went to him and was hired , and I went thither afterwards to give him a Character , because I knew his Friends in the Country . And when he came away from his Place , he brought this Plate to me wrapt up in his Shirt , and desired me to sell it for him , and buy him some Linnen , and other Necessaties ; I lodged then at Mr. Brets in Shoreditch ; but before I came there , I lived with Mr. Miller , a Silk Dyer , in Slaughter-street , in Spittle-fields . Martha Slater . She brought the Plate to my House in her Apron , and laid it down upon the Table . She said it came from her Friends in the Country , who had sent to her by the Carrier , and she wanted me to lend her 20 l. upon it ; but I refused . I had known her sometime as a Customer , but no otherwise . The Jury acquitted her , and found Peter Hughs guilty of the Indictment . Death . 7. Elizabeth Prior , Wife of James Prior , of St. Giles in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing 1 Rug , 2 Blankets , 1 Bolster , 1 Pillowbier , 1 Looking-Glass , and 2 Sheets , the Goods of William Salter , Octob . 14 . William Salter . The Prisoner was my Lodger ; she , and her Husband went away on the 14th of October , without giving me notice . When they had been gone 3 Days , I broke open the Door , and mist my Goods . I met with her again , and asked her what she had done with them ; she said they were in pawn , but she would not tell me where . William Smith . I heard her own she had stolen them Martha Williams . She owned to me that she had pawn 'd them for 15 s. she was a very honest Woman before this happen 'd . The Felony appearing to be done with the Privity of her Husband , the Jury acquitted her . 8. Edward Atkins , of St. Martin in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing 3 Silver Knee-Buckles , value 10 s. 4 Silver Stock-Buckles , value 16 s. 2 Silver Shoe-Buckles , value 12 s. 1 Silver Girdle-Buckle , value 2 s. and 1 Pair of Silver Sleeve-Buttons value 2 s. the Goods of John Liger in his Shop , October 19 . Mr. Liger . On Sunday the 13th of October I miss 'd some Buckles out of my Shew-Glass ; I thought my Man might have lent 'em : But next Morning my Man told me some Buckles were gone he could not tell how . On the 31st of October Mr. White , the Prisoner 's Master came over to me and asked me if I had miss 'd any Thing . I said , Yes . Then he shew 'd me some Buckles , and asked me if I knew them . I answer 'd Yes , very well , these are mine . He told me that he had been robb 'd too , and was afraid there was Confederacy between his Servant and mine . Upon this I examined the Prisoner , who confessed that between 11 and 12 at Night , when I was in Bed , he came to my Shop and desired my Man , who is near-sighted , to shew him some Buckles ; upon which my Man opening the Shew-Glass , he ( the Prisoner ) at twice took out several Buckles , and put them into his Pocket . Stephen Read , the Prosecutor 's Apprentice . The Prisoner said he had a Letter from a Cousin in the Country , ordering him to send her some Buckles , and therefore he desired me to shew him some ; and if they would do , he would pay me for them . Mr White . The Prisoner is my Servant . I observ 'd he had several Silver Things , and examin 'd him how he came by them . He said he met a Man in the Street who gave him a Guinea . I thought this was a villainous Story , and what encreased my Suspicion of him was , that a Man at a Brewers told me the Prisoner had presented their Maid with a Diamond Ring worth 20 Guineas . - The Prisoner was carry 'd before Mr. Justice Deveil , where he confess 'd that he took the Goods out of the Prosecutor 's Shew-Glass . Prisoner . I do n't deny that I had the Goods , but they were given me by the Prosecutor 's Wife . My first Acquaintance with her was when he and my Master went out of Town together . Her Apprentice being gone out , she desired me to shut up her Shop for her , which I did . And then she said , Ned , what do you want ? I said , A Buckle for my Hat , and one for my Stock She bid me take 'em . I asked her what they came to , she said she would not take any Thing of me . After this , I was at her House Thirteen Nights in Fourteen , while they were in Gloucestershire . Mr. Ivell . Six or Seven Weeks ago the Prisoner sold me some old broken Silver Buckles . Ruben Bowler . I was the Prisoner 's Fellow-'Prentice , and never heard that he wronged any body . Abraham Burrier . The Day the Prisoner was taken up his Master was sitting by me , when the Prosecutor came in and brought a Buckle , and said it was not quite the same as one of those that were found upon the Prisoner : And he said besides , that he had got his Number , and above his Number . Court . Above his Number : That 's a little strange ! James Needham . I went to Mr. White 's , when he was out of Town , and his 2 Boys were over the Way at the Prosecutor 's House - I have heard that they and the Prosecutor 's Wife have drank 14 Gallons of Brandy together . Mr. White . They have invented a great many Stories about junketting together , and sometimes they have run it up to 46 Gallons . Mary Garman . I went to this Gentleman , and said , Consider this young Youth - Good God ! - I never was afore a Justice my Lordship in my Life before - My Lordship should consider a young Youth - I never knew no harm of him before . Three or Four Witnesses deposed that they had known the Prisoner several Years , that they had never heard any Ill of him , and believed he was a civil honest young Man . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty . Death . 8. Samuel Luelling , of St. Paul 's Covent Garden , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch value 5 l. and a Seal value 1 l. from the Person of Edward Salisbury Nov. 4 . He was a second time indicted for stealing a Hankerchief value 1 s. from Peter Gain , November 4 . Mr. Salisbury . On the 4th of November , coming from the Bedford Arms Tavern in Covent Garden , there was a Mob gathered about 2 Men who were fighting . I stood still a little to look at 'em . when presently I felt my Watch drawn cut of my Fob . The Prisoner standing next me on my right Side , I collar 'd him before he had got his Hand quite from under my Coat , and said , Sirrah , you have got my Watch , but in struggling he twisted himself about , and as I suppose , conveyed my Watch away to some of his Companions . However , some others assisting me we at last got him into a Tavern , where he was searched . My Watch indeed was not found upon him , but the Constable took from him a Handkerchief which was own 'd by Mr. Gain . Prisoner . How came you to expect me ? Mr. Salisbury . Expect ye ? I suspected ye , because I found your Hand under my Coat at the same time that I felt my Watch drawn out of my Fob . Prisoner . When I was at the Tavern the Gentleman said , they did not expect me to be such a Man ; and the Prosecutor himself said , If I would send for any Body to my Character , he would not only discharge me , but down on his Knees and beg my pardon . Mr. Salisbury . I said no such thing . Hannah Bowen The Prisoner was my Servant 7 Years and a half I kept a Sutling . and Lodging-house at White-hall 3 Years ago , and I trusted him to take all my Money when I lay in - He has brought me 14 l. on a Night , and I never knew that he wrong 'd me of a Farthing .

Dean . I have heard that he sometimes works upon the Keys as a spare Man . Second Indictment . Mr. Gain . I was going by when Mr. Salisbury feiz 'd the Prisoner , who made a violent Resistance , and cry 'd out Murder . I assisted to thrust him into a Coach , and at last we got him into a Tavern , where the Constable searched him for Mr. Salisbury 's Watch , but could not find it . At the same time I happened to have Occasion for my Handkerchief , but feeling for it , I 'mist it . The Constable found a Handkerchief upon him . I said , before I saw it , if it is mine it is stained and snuffy ; upon which it was produced , and I knew it to be my own - Here it is . Mr. Salisbury . I saw the Constable take this Handkerchief out of the Prisoner 's Pocket , and Mr. Gain sent to his Mother for two or three more of the same sort , and they matcht exactly . Prisoner . They were not the same Size by above an Inch . Mr. Gain . Here is one of the same sort . Then the two Handkerchiefs were compared , and agreed in every particular . Mr.Hickman , Constable . Just as I had searched the Prisoner for the Watch , Mr. Gain said , he had lost his Handkerchief , which was stain 'd with Snuff . Upon which , I searched the Prisoner again , and found it . Mr. Gain sent for three more which were of the same Size and Colour . Mr. Gain . The Prisoner at first said , he had had the Handkerchief a Week , and then he said he found it that Night under the Piazza 's - I had used it but two Minutes before he was taken - When I went to him in the Gate-house , he said , I hope you 'll bring in a Bill of Ignoramus , and if you do , I 'll give you half a Guinea . The Jury found him guilty of both Indictments . Death . 9.

James Casey and William Beesly , of White-Chappel , were indicted for assaulting John Atkinson in an open Field near the High-way , putting him in fear , and taking from him 31 Yards of Cotton Check , value 27 s. Octob . 30 . The Witnesses were examin 'd apart . John Atkinson . I am a Weaver by Trade . On the 30th of October , near the Evening , I went a-cross White-Chappel Fields to King David 's Fort in Ratclif Highway , where I have some who work for me . I staid there till 7 , and then came back with a Piece of Cotton Check which one of my Men had made for me . In the middle Field , where there is a Ditch on one side , and Soil on the other . I was attack 'd by two young Fellows with Pistols , they damn 'd me , and bid me stand , or I was a dead Man . Then one of them collar 'd me , struck me over the Face with a Pistol , and swore again , D - ye , stand still ye Dog , or I 'll shoot ye . The other searched my Pockets , and finding but nine Pence , he put it in again , and said , D - him , he has got nothing but Half-pence . Then they took my Piece of Check , and so they left me . It was a Moon-light Night , and I had a full view of their Faces ; I verily believe that Casey is the Man who collar 'd me ; and that he who search 'd my Pockets was this Man here , Macdonald . I went back to my Men at King David 's Fort , and told 'em how I had been robb 'd I likewise went to the Constable at the King 's Arms in Sun-Tavern Fields , who told me that he should be out upon Duty that Night , and would look after such Fellows as I had describ 'd , and then I went home the Street way - Next Morning I went over the same Fields , and called at the Prince of Orange 's Head , which joins to the Field were I was rob 'd , and left a Description there of the Men who had rob 'd me . In about a Fortnight afterwards , some who were acquainted with my Workmen , calling at the Prince of Orange 's Head , heard that the Men who rob 'd me were apprehended , and that one of them who had made an Information , was in the New-Goal in Southwark . I went thither , and found Macdonald . He asked me if I knew him . I said , yes , I am pretty sure you are one of the Men that rob 'd me . He said , it was true enough ; for it was he that took the nine Pence , and a Key out of my Pocket , and put them in again ; and that he had made his Information before Sir John Lade , and that his Companions were in Custody . I went to Sir John Lade , and he bound me over to prosecute . When Casey 's Sister was taken on Macdonald 's Information , for receiving the Goods , I went with her to Wood-street Compter , to see her Brother , and there likewise found Beesly , who pulled off his Hat to me , and said , Sir , I hope you 'll be favourable to us - He own 'd himself to be acquainted with Macdonald : But I do n't remember that ever I saw Beesly before ; for I saw but two Men when I was rob 'd , and these two I believe were Casey and Macdonald . John Bishop . I happened to be at Justice Lade 's when Macdonald made his Information ; and coming from thence over the Water , I went to drink with Mr. Atkins at the Bull-head in Bread-street . While we were there , Beesly and John Sutton came in together , and were presently follow 'd by Casey and two more . They all appear 'd to be of one Company . Sutton enquired for Macdonald , and said , he heard he was in some Jail , but he did not know in what Jail . I told them , I believed Mr. Atkins could inform them ; I gave Atkins a hint that I fancied these were the Men who were in Macdonald 's Information . So we kept them drinking till we got sufficient Assistance , and then we apprehended them all Five . D - my Eyes , says Jack Sutton , here 's almost two Load of us . John Macdonald . I have known the two Prisoners about half a Year . On the King 's Birth-day , which was the Day after my Lord Mayor 's Day , we all went to the House of Mrs. Dick 's in the Back Lane in White-Chappel , going towards Stepney Fields ; there we staid drinking till past seven at Night , and then to Tom-Turd-Man 's Hole in White-Chappel Fields , where we saw the Prosecutor coming along ; upon which I said to Beesly , act out of the Path , and watch who comes t'other way , for here is but one Man , and we can deal with him ; so Beesly went behind a Bank , about half a Stone 's throw off ; and then Casey collar 'd the Gentleman , and beat him about the Head with a Pistol ; and then I searched his Pockets , and took out a Six Pence , and Three Pennyworth of Half-Pence ; which being but a Trifle , I bid him take it again . Then I took up the Piece of Check , and ran with it to Beesly , and gave it him to take care of . Casey and I followed the Prosecutor at a little Distance , as far as Mr. Emery 's Garden ; then we returned , and meeting Beesly , we all went to Aldgate , where we took Coach , and went to an Ale-house in St. Giles 's , which was then kept by one Leadbeater ; but he is now run away . There we measured the Check , and found there was 31 Yards ; we carried it to Casey 's Sister in Covent-Garden , and gave it her to pawn for us ; and I likewise gave her a Handkerchief of my own . She brought us 17 s. for the Check , and 2 s. for the Handkerchief . We spent all the Money before we parted , in Victuals , Beer , and Gin ; except half a Crown which I paid for a Wig - We lived together three or four Days in a Cellar . Martha Busby . I was Nurse to Mrs. Dicks , who lives in the Back Lane against the Blue-Anchor . About Six o'Clock at Night - I do n't remember the Day of the Month ; but it was some remarkable Day , for there was a Bonfire before the King 's Purveyor 's Door - It might be five or six Weeks ago - Macdonald , and he in the Red Coat [ pointing to Casey ] and I believe the other Prisoner , but I ca n't be so positive to him , came Mrs. Dicks and went into a back Room , and shut the Door . I think they had half a Pint of Gin , and staid about half an Hour , and then they went away together towards the Fields . Macdonald has drank there several times ; I have seen Casey twice with him ; but I do n't remember any thing of seeing Beesly there before that one Night . Casey .

We follow 'd and the Prosecutor took hold of the Prisoner by the Nag's-head Tavern ; but the Prisoner was not that Man in the Cape Coat that I saw at first , but there was another Man close by who turn 'd about and run , and just as he turn 'd I felt something hit against my Foot . I stoop 'd down and found it was the Watch . Court . Did the Watch fall from the Prisoner , or the other Man ? Beck . They had both Cape Coats . The Prisoner stood at my Left Hand . I held him by the Right Shoulder , and the Prosecutor held him on the other Side , and the Watch fell at my Right Foot a Yard from the Prisoner . Court . If the other Man had taken the Watch , is it likely that he would follow the Prosecutor with it , stand quietly by him , and then throw it away when he was not in Custody , nor so much as suspected . John Dawson . The Prisoner in a Cape Coat and red Breeches and two or three more Men husseled me , and my Uncle Mr. Tireman so that they could not go one Way or other for 2 or 3 Minutes , and then they went back and Mr. Tireman miss 'd his Watch . The People said those Fellows had been larking about for 2 or 3 Hours , we follow 'd them . Beck told us they were at the Swan Door ; my Uncle and I passed the Prisoner without minding him , but Beck hipped and said , There goes the Man up the Old Change . The Prisoner then mended his Pace . We pursued , and Mr. Tireman and I collered him ; Beck was then a little behind us , and no body else was near us . When Beck came up , I did not indeed see the Prisoner drop the Watch , but I saw his Hand under his Coat , and presently Beck stoop 'd and took the Watch up from between the Prisoner 's Legs . and said , Here 's your Watch , I had like to have taken it before it fell to the Ground . Prisoner . There was a hundred Mob about us . Mr. Dawson . There was no body , before the Watch was drop 'd , but Mr. Tireman and I , and Beck and the Prisoner ; but presently afterwards the People gathered about us . We carry 'd the Prisoner into the Star Passage , where 2 or 3 Fellows would have rescued him ; but a Gentleman drew his Sword and made 'em keep off . [ Then Beck was called in again , for the Witnesses were examined apart . ] Court . Where did the other Man in the Cape Coat stand . Beck . At my Right Hand , the same Side as the Watch fell . Court . Who else did you see there when the Watch was dropt ? Beck . There was a Mob of 20 People about us , and they were going to seize him . Court . For what ? Did any body charge him ? Beck . No . Court . Where was Mr. Dawson then ? Beck . I do n't remember that I saw him till we came into the Star Alehouse , nor that I saw him before the Justice . Mr. Dawson . I had hold of the Prisoner . There was no Man in a Cape Coat but the Prisoner , and I was with him before the Justice . Mr. Tireman . Mr. Dawson was with me when I lost my Watch , when we took the Prisoner , when we were at the Ale-house , and before the Justice .

That Answer not being very agreeable as I thought , I damn 'd her and bid her get up : Then I went to my Lord St. John 's Door and called his Porter , who got up immediately ; I return 'd in a Minute and found Mr. Cantillon 's Door open . How it came open I ca n't tell , for I saw no body below in the House nor in the Street ; but going thro ' the Hall into the Back Yard and looking up , I saw Isaac Berridge on the Lids on the Top of the House , I told him the House was on Fire : He said By-God he saw no Fire . Presently I saw it come out under the Roof and shewed it him , and then he said , Aye by God , so it is . Council .

Then I smelt it , and got up ; and she and I went down , and search 'd the lower Part of the House , but found nothing there . We went up again , and then we found it was ready to break into our House . Malachi Kelly , sworn . Malachi Kelly . I am Servant to Mr. Percival . At half an Hour past 3 , hearing the other Servants going up and down , I suspected Fire and got up . We apprehended that it was in Mr. Cantillon 's House , because our House-keeper discovered it first in her Chamber , which was next to his House . My Master and I went into the Garden , and the Smoke seemed to come out towards the Top of Mr. Cantillon 's House , by the Party-Wall . Then I went into the Street , and Mr. Cantillon 's Door being open - I ca n't tell who opened it , for it was open before I came - I went into the Hall , where I found one of his Men - I ca n't say which of them it was , but I told him there was a Fire . He went with me into their Garden , and looking up , I saw the other Man-Servant upon the House , and perceived the Smoke coming out of the Crevises of the Window up one Pair of Stairs backward . Upon which , I asked him that was with me , if his Master was in Town . He said yes . Is that his Bed-Chamber , says I , where the Smoke came out ? He said yes . And is he a-bed ? says I again . I believe so , says he . Then , why the Devil , says I , - or - Damn ye ! - I do n't know which of the two it was - Why do n't you call him up ? And upon this we went up Stairs . Council . Which of you went first ? M. Kelly . He went foremost , but I went with him - I believe I might have him by the Hand . Council . When you came up Stairs did you see any Smoke or Fire ? M. Kelly . No , not in the least , till we came to the Bed-Chamber-Door . Council . Now look at the Prisoners , and see if you can tell which of them it was you went up Stairs with ? M. Kelly . I am not sure it was either of them , but it was one of the two Men . Council . Was it he that you saw upon the House ? M. Kelly . No , it was he that I was with in the Garden . Council . What was done when you came to the Chamber-Door ? M. Kelly . He turned the Bolt and opened it , and out came the Smoke : upon which he turned back to the Wainscot , and kick 'd against it , and said , Master ! Master ! Fire ! Fire ! I bid him go and pull him out . So he went in and took him by the Legs , and brought him to the Door , but no Part of the Body without the Door . He held him Knee high by the Legs , and I saw that he was dead , tho ' I thought before , that he had been alive . The Deceas 'd seem 'd to be quite naked to the Navel . There was a vast many red Spots on his Belly . Knees and Legs , and down his Thighs - he was all over large Spots . Council . Did you observe any Part about him , that appeared to be scorched or sindged ? M. Kelly . No , I saw no Scorching or Sindging . Conncil . How near were you to him ? M. Kelly . I was then about 6 Feet from the Chamber-Door . Council . You say that he was naked to the Navel : do ye know if any Part of him was cover 'd ? Had he a Shirt or a Night-Cap on ? M. Kelly . I ca n't say as to that , for I did not see his Head nor his Arms , I saw nothing but the lower Part of his Body , as the Servant had hold of his Legs . Council . Then he might have had a Shirt on the Rest of his Body , and a Night-Cap on his Head , tho ' you did not see them ? M. Kelly . Yes , he might . Council . Did you see any Fire in the Room ? M. Kelly . No , There was Smoke in the Room - a vast Deal of Smoke , but I saw no Fire . Court . What , was no Part of the Furniture on Fire ? M. Kelly . Not that I could see , for the Door was not quite open , and I saw nothing in the Room but that Part of the Body . Council . By what Light did you see the Body ? M. Kelly . It was Day-Light , as it is now : and the Light that I had , was from the Street-Window . Council . Did those red Spots upon the Body appear to be Blood ? M. Kelly . I ca n't say they were Blood , but I thought he was murder 'd . Council . Did you see Elizabeth Pembroke there ? M. Kelly . No ; When I came to the House I saw one of the Maids in the Entry , but I believe it was the Cook . Council . Did you observe the Smoke come out of any Room but that where the Deceas 'd lay ? Kelly . I ca n't say that I did , but I thought it time to save him . Council . Was that Servant who went up with you , drest ? M. Kelly . He was in a Cap and Frock , and so I think was he upon the House . Council . In what manner did he that was with you , go up Stairs ? M. Kelly . He ran up in a Hurry before me , and immediately after he had knock 'd at the Wainscot , he went into the Room and pull 'd the Deceas 'd out by the Legs ; and as soon as ever I saw him , I said to the Servant your Master is murder 'd . Court . How far did he bring the Deceas 'd ? M. Kelly . Almost to the Chamber Door , and then I left him . Court . Was he holding the Deceas 'd when you went away ? M. Kelly . He had him by the Legs ; but I believe he might not be holding still ; but might be drawing the Body out , when I ran away ; for I ran away as soon as I saw it . Then I ran to call the Engines ; but I went no further than the Corner of Conduit-street , where I gave the Word , and so it was carried to the Church , and I ran back in five Minutes . Mr. Cantillon 's House was then in a Blaze backwards ; Our House was on Fire too , and I went to save our own Things . Ann Shuttleworth , sworn . Ann Shuttleworth , Mr. Percival 's House-keeper . The first thing that I perceived was a great Smoke which waked me ; I got up , and awaken 'd the Family . I went to Mr. Cautillon 's Door ; Malachi Kelly was then in the House , and I was going in when I heard the Shriek of Woman 's Voices , crying three or four times that their Master was murder 'd . They were then up two Pair of Stairs , and came down screaming the same - Council . Was Elizabeth Pembroke one of them ? A. Shuttleworth . Yes . Council . Was she drest ? A. Shuttleworth . She was drest as Servants generally are in a Morning - The Fire was not then broke out ; nor did I see any Smoke in Mr. Cantilion 's Hall . Council . Did you go in ? A. Shuttleworth . No ; I only stood at the Hall Door ; for as I was stepping to go in , I heard the shriek of Murder , and the Maids , immediately came down and out at the Door , and stood upon the Flags . I said , I wonder 'd they did not go in and try to put the Fire out ; and then I went directly into our House , and up Stairs ; by which time the Fire was breaking into my Bed Chamber , which was opposite to Mr. Cantillon 's Two-pair of Stairs Room . William Marson , sworn . W. Marson . I was Servant to my Lady Mary Cooley , who lived almost over against Mr. Cantillon 's House .

Mary Walker , who had lived with Mr. Cantillon three Weeks , had been our House Maid . She was standing at his Door , and called me over . I went ; I saw there was a great Smoke , but no Fire . I ran up one Pair of Stairs , and saw the Corps of the Deceas 'd lying at length upon the Landing Place - I saw by his Face that it was the Deceas 'd - He was naked to the Stomach . Council .

Yes ; There was a violent Fire in the Room , and it made 2 great Ratling - Miss Dollin beg 'd me to carry her over : I took her in my Arms , but I was in such a Fright , I scarce knew how I got down Stairs - In a few Minutes afterwards , the House was all in a Fire - I did not see that the Servants were drest ; they had their Cloths on slackly . The Men were in their Frocks ; but I am not sure they were button 'd . Council . Had you any Discourse with either of the Prisoners after this ? W. Marson . Yes ; When most of the Hurry was over , I saw one or both of the Men standing in the Street ; I spoke to one of them ; he was talking to some of the People ; and he said , he pulled his Master out of Bed - And I think he said , his Master was burnt - I saw them standing there a Week or 10 Days afterwards , when the Ashes were sifting ; but I had no particular Discourse with 'em then . Oliver Price , sworn . Oliver Price . I liv 'd at my Lord St John 's when the Fire happen 'd at Mr. Cantillon 's , which was next Door ; I went up one Pair of Stairs ; I saw the lower Part of the Deceas'd 's Body ; the Lappet of his Shirt was turned over his Stomach .

Council . Was the Body in the Room ? O . Price . No ; it was out upon the Stairs - the Stairs turned short , and the Body lay at the Corner of the Turning . Council . Did you see any Fire in the Bed-Chamber ? O . Price . I did not look into the Bed Chamber ; and I do n't remember that I saw any Fire , or any Smoke , or smelt any . Council .

Price . I do n't know that I did . Charles Woolmer sworn . Charles Woolmer . On Tuesday the 14th of May last , as I was going by Vine-street to a Brew-house with a Cask in my Hand ; there was a Man on the Top of a House cry 'd Fire ; I ran round to Albemarle-street , and saw Mr. Cantillon 's three Maids at his Door . They said , their Master was dead . I ran up Stairs , and saw no Fire then ; but the Deceas 'd was lying at full length with his Head against his own Door , and his Feet to the Parlor . He had a White Cap on , and his Shirt was turned up to his Navel ; his Privities appear 'd bruised and blackish ; his Linnen was not at all sindged . I stept to the Chamber Door , looked in , and saw the Bed standing , and the Cloths turned up against the side of the Wall . I ran down . The Servants were all in the Entry , crying , and wringing their Hands . Council . Did the Men cry ? C. Woolmer . I did not perceive that they cry 'd ; but the Maids did - Why , says I , Do n't you take care to bring him down ? Council . Which of them did you speak to to take care of the Body ? C. Woolmer I think it was to Isaac , but they were all together - I ran up again , but then a Flame burst out of the Chamber Door , and then I said it was too late . Council . How long was that after the first time you went up ? C. Woolmer . It was presently after ; for I ran up and down the first and second time as fast as I could ; and at the second going up , the Fire burst out and caught hold of the Wainscot , and the Banisters of the Stairs , and crack , crack , crack , they went in a Moment . Elizabeth Joakin , sworn . Elizabeth Joakin . I was at my Lord Craven 's , a pretty way from Mr. Cantillon 's House ; but I was going by there with Mary Mersit , about 4 o'Clock in the Morning . At first , I only stood over the way against the Back-side of the House , and saw the smoke come out at the top , but no Fire . In a Quarter of an Hour we went round , and stood over against the Foreside of the House , and then I saw the Flare of the Fire ; it seemed to be up one Pair of Stairs . The Street Door was open , and the Servants were coming out ; I saw two Maids come out first , one of them was the Kitchen-Maid , and the other was Elizabeth Pembroke : I asked them if they belong 'd to the Family ; they said , Yes ; I asked them if all their Family was out ; they answered , No , their Master was burnt , and they saw him dead , and bloody - Then Isaac Berridge , and the other Maid came out . And Mary Mersit asked them several times why they did not bring their Master out . The Man answered , That he brought him to the Top of the Stairs , but having no help , could get him no farther : That he left him at Night reading abed ; and that he knew he had 500 l. in the House . Council . Did he say in what Room it was ? E. Joakin . He said it was in the Fire . Council . Were the Servants drest ? E. Joakin .

Elizabeth Joakin , and I were going by Mr. Cantillon 's just as the Fire began . When we came round into Albemarle-street , two Maids and one Man stood upon the Steps : We asked if all the Family were out of the House ; and the Maids answered ( for the Man was not there then ) that their Master was burnt to death ; and that one of their Men went in when the Room was in Fire , and dragg 'd him by the Legs , and his Head dropt off , and so he left him there . Council . What the Witness heard a strange Maid say , is no Evidence . M. Mersit . But then I saw Isaac ; and he himself said , that he went in and dragg 'd him by the Legs , and his Head dropped off ; that there was a great deal of Fire in the Room , and so left him on the Stair 's Head , and then went to another Room where he thought his Master had got 500 l. and forced the Door open ; but the Flames bursting out , he could not save any thing - We were in Bond-street when we first heard of the Fire , and so we came round - The Door was open before we came , and we saw the Fire was on the Stair Case ; but no Fire without side the House at that time - The Maids had their Cloths on loosely , and one of them had her Stays in her Lap . The Man had a Napkin Cap , and his Stockings were not tied up - I do n't know any of the Maids , but they cry 'd prodigiously ; and the Man seem 'd to be very much concern 'd .

Mr. Parry penn 'd down what it was , which I ca n't remember , only there was some talk how the House came on Fire , and one of the Maids , I think it was the Prisoner , said , When I came down and saw my Master bloody , I was frighted out of my Wits . Bloody ? says I , How came he to be bloody ? and Berridge made answer . In pulling him down seven Stairs his Bowels came out . Elizabeth Pembroke . Had I my Cloths all on when I came to your House ?

Leneve . Next Day I and my Fellow-Servant Elizabeth James ( who was Mr. Percival 's Cook , went to the Red Horse in Bond Street . The two Men , Berridge and Arnold were standing at the Door , and the three Maids were drinking Tea within . We sat down with them , and asked them how the Fire happened . Elizabeth Pembroke answered , My Master is very much given to Reading in his Bed , and he did it himself . What time did he come home ? Says I . Between 10 and 11 . Says she . Was he in Drink ? Says I , No , She said he was sober , she put him to Bed herself , drew the Curtains , and shut the Windows . Then he took his Book , and she said to him , Sir , do ye want any thing else ? He answer 'd No . I may read these two or three Hours ; and as she was going out , he said to her , Bid the Footman take the Key of the Door that I may n't be disturbed in the Morning , and tell him to take a Side-Box in the Play house ; and so she said the Footman took the Key and carry 'd it down and laid it upon the Table ; and , as luck would have it , they had the Key , or they should all have been burnt - I asked her why they did not bring their Master down Stairs ; and she said the Man was bringing him down , but the Fire catch 'd hold of his ( the Man 's ) Cap , and he fell down over his Master on the Stairs , and some body came and fetch 'd him ( the Man ) away , or he had been burnt too .

That she shut the Door herself , and he called his Man and bid him take the Key ; but did not say what Key . - Leneve asked her why they did not take their Master down : And she made answer , that the Man did go to take him , but swooned upon the Corps , and his Cap was on fire , and he had been burnt if some body had not carried him away . Council . Did she say nothing else of her Master ? E. J . That the Left-side of his Face and Shoulders , and Belly were burnt . Council . Nothing else ? E. J . Not about her Master ; but she said that when the Servant knock 'd at the Door , she jump 'd out of Bed , and he called Fire : but she did not believe him , and so was going to Bed again ; but something pull 'd her by the Arm and said , Get up , or you 'll be burnt : And presently she heard her Fellow-Servants upon the Stairs .

On Saturday between 9 and 10 at Night , as I was walking along , I happened to be forced into this House , the lower Part of Green-Bank , at the Back of Wapping-New-Stairs , by the Prisoner who stood at the Door : I sat down with her by the Fire-side , and had a Hot-pot , for which I paid a Shilling ; I pull 'd my Watch out and laid it upon the Table , and in 6 Minutes it was gone . The Door was shut , and there was no body then in the House but she and I. Mary Kirkall . On the Sunday Morning I saw a Watch in the Prisoner 's Hand , and she said the Man had left it for 9 s. and if he came and paid the Money he must have it . Prisoner . As I and a Woman who looked after the House , were sitting by the Fire , this Man came in and sat down by us , and asked for a Hot-pot , which I fetch 'd for him , and then went of his own Resolution up Stairs , and would fain have been rude with me ; but I bid him pay what was due first ; and so he left his Watch , having no Money to pay his Reckoning , and I pawn 'd it to Mrs. Baldry in King Street , in Wapping . The Jury acquited her . 66 . Elizabeth nixon , was indicted for assaulting Richard Cartwright in a House unknown , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Watch value 3 l. Octob . 23 .

They had pull 'd down one of the Rooms to make a Fire in the other ; and so they had set Fire to the Place once . The Neighbours were about getting a Warrant to turn 'em out . I was willing to know what sort of Cattle they were , and going in for that purpose , the Prisoner , and another Woman enticed me up Stairs , and there they fell upon me , and rummaged me about , and got me down - I suppose they had a mind to be great with me , for they ravish 'd me - of my Watch : But I ca n't swear that the Prisoner was one of those that took it . Acquitted . 67.

Mr. Allen . The Prisoners were both my Servants ; Thursby came to live with me on the 14th of August last . Brown was my Cook . They both lay together in a Room , up three Pair of Stairs : My Mother lay in another Room on the same Floor . On the 27th of October my House was broke and robb 'd in the Night : I do n't know who did it ; but we were alarmed by Thursby . She goes first to my Mother , lays her Hand on her Face and wakes her , and tells her there were three Rogues in the House ; but desires her not to come out of her Room for fear the Rogues should murder her . Then she goes to the Window and calls out Thieves . The Noise waked me . I got up , and taking the Key of the Door with me , went down Stairs , I found all my Doors and Windows fast , except the Parlor Window , and that was open . The Sash was thrown up , and the two Alarm-Bells were taken and laid down upon the Table . The Drawers were open . The Goods in the Indictment were taken away ; besides which , there was a Petticoat dropt , and a Gown half in and half out . Thursby told me that as she was a-bed with Brown she was waked by the Noise of her own Trunk being broke open , and then saw three Men , one in Grey , one in Olive , and one in Black : That two of them had Masks , and the other had a black Crape over his Face , and a long Knife in his Hand , that he threatned to cut their Throats if they did not lye still ; that he plunder 'd her Trunk , took out her Cloths and a Purse of Money which he chink 'd in his Hand , and then they tyed up her Clothes in a Table-Cloth and went away - I called in a Constable : he said . This must be done by your own Servants . I said , I believed my Men to be very honest , and had no suspicion of Sarah Thursby , because she had been robb 'd ; but Brown had lost nothing , and therefore carried her before a Justice who , committed her to the Gatehouse , where she lay three Days - Three Weeks after this we found a Suit of Thursby 's Clothes at Pawn , and they proved to be the same that she said she had been robb 'd of : Upon this I carried her before the Justice . At first , she said she had pawn 'd no Clothes , but afterwards own 'd that those were hers . She was carried before the Justice again the next Day ; but as we could prove nothing upon her , he bid her go home again , and not fly from me , for if she did he told her it would be an Argument of Guilt . But notwithstanding this , she left my House and I went next Day to enquire for her at a House in Wapping , where her Mother-in-Law lives : Her Mother-in-Law told me that she had been a Thief to her - Court . You must not swear to what the Mother-in-Law told ye - Tis no Evidence . Mrs. Allen . Thursby said she had lost 20 Guineas and the Value of 20 l. in Clothes . One Suit which she said was lost at that time , we afterwards found at Pawn , where it had laid three Weeks before . Prisoner Thursby . Was not there a Corner-Cupboard full of Plate in the Parlor from whence your Goods were taken ? Mrs. Allen . Yes , there was Plate . Thursby . As I knew this : it is likely , if I had been concerned in the Robbery , that I would have taken the Gowns and Petticoats and left the Plate ? Court . Did you ever find any of your Goods again ? Mrs. Allen . No , none of them . Mary Keeble . Thursby pawn 'd those Clothes to me . Court . What Clothes ? Mary Keeble . I suppose they were her own . I have them here in a Paper - But - beging your Pardon - I must put my Spectacles on - Let me see - and here 's a Gown and Coat Sept. 7. laid for 40 s : Sept 13 , a Cap for 5 s. Octob . 8. a black silk-Hood and a Body of a Shift for 4 s. Octob . 12 a Velvet Cap for 6 s. Octob . 19. a Pair of Ruffles for 5 s. - that 's the last - the last ? No , hold - here 's some in November - but that 's nothing - . Mrs. Allen . That Gown and Coat she said she was robb 'd of : tho ' she had pawn 'd it in September , and we were not robb 'd till the 27th of October . Thursby . 'T is not the same , for the Gown and Coat that I lost were of another Colour . My Mistress knows that I told her another Colour ; and as I told her , so it was put in the Advertisement , and here the Advertisement is to prove it . Mrs. Allen . It was a drest Suit , and she told me that she had but one drest Suit . Sarah Cox . On the 20th of November , Thursby came to me much better drest than I had seen her lately . She brought these Men 's Shoes and Stockings and desired to get her a Suit of Men 's Apparel , and procure her a Passage to Jamaica with some Captain that would take her as his Boy . She seem 'd to be under a great Concern ; but being so well drest I said to her , Mrs. Collet , ( for that was her first Husband 's Name ) the Times are well mended . She answered , But indifferent . Are ye out of Service says I. Aye says she , I have left my Master these three Weeks , tho ' it seems she had then been come away but one Day ; And she told me that Captain Towers had given her a Suit of Cloaths , and a Fan and five Guineas . Henry Tomlin . Thursby came to me on the 25th of August in a Brocade Suit with red Flowers . Court . Are ye sure it was in August . H. T. Yes . Court . Were those the Clothes that were pawned ? H. T. Yes - I am glad to see you so tight says I . And so , says she , Christian Brown our Cook let three Men into our House and kept them five Hours in the Dust-hole , and then they came up Stairs in Disguise , and one of them had a long Knife , and I lay with my Hand upon my Eyes pretending to be asleep for fear they should kill me , and they took this Brocaded Suit out of my Trunk . Court . How is this possible ? Could she tell you on the 25th of August , that she was robb 'd on the 27th of October following ? H. T. No , this was not all at the same time . She came to me in that Suit on the 25th of August , and she came again in October , and it was then that she told me the Rogues had robb 'd her of the Suit she had on the last time she saw me . Mrs. Tomlin deposed to the same Effect . Thursby . My Master and Mistress tamper 'd with these People to make it up with me ; but I would not agree to it . Martin Johnson . Mrs. Allen was at my House several times , and endeavour 'd to persuade me to go to the Prisoner Thursby , and tell her that I could swear , that I knew the Clothes that were at pawn were the same as she said she had lost . Mary Johnson . Mrs. Allen came to me , and shew 'd me a Piece of Silk , and said , Go to your Sister , and swear , that you can swear this to be a Piece of the Clothes that she lost . Then ten or twelve Witnesses appear 'd to the Prisoner 's Reputation . They deposed that she was about 21 Years of Age , and they had known her some seven or eight , some fifteen , some twenty Years , and that she bore a very good Character . The Jury acquitted Brown , and found Thursby guilty to the value of 39 s . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 70.

Mary Campion , was indicted for stealing a Pair of Pattins , an Apron , and a Handkerchief , the Goods of Thomas Nutsford , Aug. 24 . Abigal Nutsford . I am a poor Woman , and sell a few Greens ; and I selling a few Greens ; and such a matter , and a little small Beer and a Dram , and the like ; says my Husband one Day - for my Husband you must know is a Porter , and he was going out - and says he to me , Tab , says he , If my Master should come , save a Jobb for me ; and this Creature , Mary Campion owing me three Pence , she said as how she would clean my Room for it , or else she would never pay me . Whereof I thought I might as well let her do it ; and so I goes out , and leaves her to clean this Room : and while I was gone , she pulls open my Drawers , and takes my things , and breaks me as much Crockery as comes to 3 or 4 Shillings - And when I came home , she was gone , and my Child said ; Mammy , she has put your Apron in her Pocket , and so set a good while there was no such thing as finding her , high nor low ; but at last , I meets with her a going along the Street , and she had got my Pattins on - I can safely swear it , and I have but three Weeks to go . - And having these Pattins on ; Mistress , says I , these are my Pattins . Well , says she , and what then ? Why then pray give them me , says I : No , says she , I 'll give ye none of them - Nap my Cuckold for 'em - And now she pretends truly , that I had lent her the Pattins : but if I had , why did not she bring them home again ? Pray tell me that : and then I desire to know what Satisfaction I must have for my Crockery-Ware that she broke ; and more than that , she proffer 'd this Man Mr. Shaw , to give him a Dram out of my Bottle . Prisoner . Why do n't you pay me for washing your Smock ? - You know that while I was a washing it , you was forced to stand without one . Prosecutrix . Well , and a good Shift too . Prisoner . Aye , so it was , for them that can make a Shift , without a Shift . Pros . You made a Shift to walk off with my Pattins - Pray what did you keep out of the way for ? If I did not know myself to be a Thief , what occasion had I to keep out of the way ? Prisoner . She lent me the Pattins to clean her Room , and as I was cleaning it , I happen 'd to throw down her Crockery-Ware : and for that she stopt my Broom and my Child 's Frock which I had left behind me . And so when she met me afterwards , and asked me for her Pattins , I told her , if she 'd give me my Broom and my Frock , I 'd give her the Pattins . Pros . It 's no such Thing ; she said nothing , but , Nap my Cuckold ! Nap my Cuckold ! But howsomever , when her Cuckold came the next Day , and asked for her Things , I let him have 'em .
