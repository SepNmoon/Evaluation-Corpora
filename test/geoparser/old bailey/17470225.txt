What was the Prisoner in that House ? Millet . She was Kitchen Girl , Sir . Q . Do you know any thing of her being with Child ? Millet . Nothing at all , Sir ; we did not know that she was with Child . Q . What is it you know in Relation to this Matter ? Millet . I do n't know any thing relating to the Murder . Q . Did you know at any Time , or when she was with Child ? Millet . No , Sir . Q . What is it you know of a Child being wrapped up in a Petticoat ? Millet . I know I went up Stairs a little before Nine ; I do n't know the Day of the Month , it was of a Tuesday . Q . How long ago was it ? In what Month Mrs Millet ? Millet . It was about a Month ago last Tuesday , I went up Stairs in the Room where she lay . Q . Had she been ill before that , or kept her Bed ? Millet . No , when I went up to her , I asked her what was the Matter , and she said nothing at all to me ; and I was very much surprized and came down Stairs , and went and fetched the Midwife . Q . Did you perceive any thing that made you to think a Midwife was necessary ? Millet . Yes , Sir . Q . What was that ? Millet . I thought by what I did see , there must be a Child . Q . Had you this Thought by what you observed upon the Prisoner , or by what you observed in Relation of any Linnen or Bed ? Millet . By what I observed on the Bed , and in the Room too . Court . Well , you went to call the Midwife , and did she come ? Millet . Yes , the Midwife came and found the Child . Q . What was that Child found in ? Millet . It was laid in an old Petticoat under the Head of the Bed . Q . Was you present when the Midwife took out the Child ? Millet . Yes , Sir . Q . Is the Midwife here ? Millet . Yes , Sir . Q .

Then you saw nothing but Marks of Blood upon the Linnen and Floor , did you ? Millet . No , Sir . Q . Did you observe the Child whether there were any Marks of Violence ? Millet . No , Sir . Mary Bland was the next and only Witness besides , but being a Quaker she would not take an Oath , therefore was not admitted as an Evidence . Q. to Mary Millet , the former Witness . Was you present while Mary Bland examined this Child ? Did you and she examine the Child together ? Millet . Yes , Sir . Q . Could you form any Kind of Judgment whether this Child had been alive ? Millet Really , Sir , I can not tell that indeed . Q . At that Time what was the best of your Judgment , whether the Child was born alive or dead . Millet . To the best of my Judgment the Child might have been born alive , but for want of proper Assistance to be sure the Child could not live long . Court . Then you can not take it upon you to say whether the Child was or was not born alive . Millet . I ca n't indeed , Sir Court . You do n't know she was with Child , or this was the Child she was delivered of ? nor you do n't know whether she was actually delivered of any Child ? Millet . Sir , I can not say , I was not in the Room with her . Court . Nor you ca n't certainly say by these Marks you saw , that she was delivered of a Child ? Millet . I could not be sure , but I thought it must be so by what I did see . Court . You did not discover this Child at the Head of the Bed till the Midwife came , did you ? Millet . I was in a great Fright , and I did not look for it . Q . In what Condition was the Prisoner , was she in her Senses ? Millet . I think she was not in her right Senses . Q . Was there any Behaviour at that Time that induced you to think she was crazy ? Millet . I think the Nature of a Woman , except she was out of her Senses , would not make away or destroy her own . Q . Did you talk to her at that Time ? Millet . She talked to no Body , nor gave no Body any Answer . Q . What Time might it be between your going up first , and the coming of the Midwife ? Millet . About five or six Minutes to be sure . Q . How long had she been up Stairs before you went up Stairs after her ? Millet . About an Hour and an Half , Sir . Q . Had you any Conversation with her afterwards ? Millet . No , Sir , only asked her how she could do so , but she made me no Answer . Q . Do you construe by her Behaviour that she was stupified ; that she was in her Senses , or was not ? Millet . I believe she was stupified . Court . You believe she had not the Government of her Understanding ? Millet . No , I believe she had not . Q . Is she a sensible Woman at other Times ? Millet . She is a very sensible young Woman . Q . Have you had any Conversation with her since that Time ? Millet . Yes ; and she said her Child came dead into the World . Q . Has she since talked sensibly ? Millet . Yes , Sir . Q . Do you think from the Condition she was in at that Time she was sensible what came upon her ? Had she drank any thing that Day ? Millet . Nothing at all , any farther than common drink . Q . What was her Behaviour in general ? Millet . She always behaved like a very sober , honest Girl ; I never heard her speak an ill Word in my Life . Acquitted . 130.

Vincent Symonds was indicted for stealing one Feather-bed , two Pillows , six Woollen Blankets , four Camblet Bed-Curtains , three Camblet Window-Curtains , & c. out of the Dwelling-House of Thomas Dingley , the Goods and Chattels of William Meade , Esq ; January 26 . Q. to William Meade , Esq ; Will you give an Account of what you know in Relation to the Fact charged upon the Prisoner ? Mr Meade . On the 26th of January last , about eight o'Clock in the Morning , I was told that Mr Dingley 's House was broke open and robbed ; upon that I goes directly to see what was taken out of the House ; I went over , and the first Room I came into , that I call the Red-bed-chamber ( I let this House to Mr Dingley ) I missed a Feather bed , two Pillows , three Blankets , a Bed-quilt , and four Camblet Bedcurtains , and two Harateen Window-curtains . Court . You say you let this House to Mr Dingley ? Mr Meade . Yes , my Lord , he had it for three Years , from Year to Year . Q . Do you know the Prisoner 's having these Things ? Mr Meade . Yes , my Lord . Court . You do n't know any thing particularly , whether this House was located or fastened , but as you have been told ? Mr Meade . I know as much as this , my Lord , I found it open , and it used to be locked . Q . Did you observe any Marks of Violence on the Door ? Mr Meade . No , my Lord ; there is a great old Peartree at the Side of the House : I apprehend he came upon that Tree , and got in at a little Window at the Side of it ; for I found the wooden Bar of that little Window broke . Q . Do you know any thing concerning these Goods ? Mr Meade . It was noised about that Mr Dingley 's House was broke open ; it was my Servant found the Goods in the Prisoner 's House . Q . To the Prisoner . Will you ask Mr Meade any Questions ? Prisoner . I beg to know whether he can swear to that Blanket the Bed was wrapped in ; it is very hard that the Blanket should be sworn to amongst the rest , which I bought in May last . Q. to William Ashly . What is it you know in relation to the breaking open Mr Dingley 's House , and stealing Goods from thence ? Ashely . Mr Dingley 's Man , Thomas Clark the Gardener , called me over , and said , I believe the House is broke open : He said , let us look in the House ; so I went directly , and there I found the Bed , Blanket , and all those Things Master has mentioned , gone out of the House . Q . What Bed was it ? Ashly . It was a large Feather-bed , with a brown Ticking ; there were all the Pillows gone , put into a Sack . Q . Did you miss any Blankets ? Ashly . Yes , my Lord ; I am sure we missed three , and a Bed-curtain too . Q . What were those in the Bed room ? Ashly . In the Bed room the Curtain was taken away , and the Feather-bed . Q . Was there any Blankets out of the other Room missing ? Ashly . I believe there was , my Lord ; but I can not speak so particularly as to them . Q . Do you know any thing of these Goods since ? Ashly . My Lord , I found the Feather-bed in the Prisoner 's House . Q . Where ? Ashly . In Warden-lane , in Thistleworth . Q . Did you find any thing else ? Ashly . He had taken the Feathers out of his own Bed , and put my Master 's Feathers and Tick in his Sack : I can swear that was my Master 's Bed . Q . Did you find any thing else there ? Ashly . I know only of the Feather bed and Blankets ; a large fine white good Blanket . Q . Where was that large fine white Blanket ? Ashly . On the top of the Bed ; the Bed was made , and he had put it upon the top of my Master 's Bed . Q . Was the Prisoner present , when you seized these Things in the Sack ? Ashly . No , my Lord ; he was run away . Q . How came you to say that was your Master 's Blanket ? Ashly . I do n't know directly ; but I can swear to the Bed . Court . Then you can not swear positively to the Blanket 's being your Master 's Blanket . Ashly . I can not swear to it , but it was like it . Q . Do you know the Value of the Bed ? Ashly . It was a very large one ; I believe it might be worth 3 l. but I am no Judge of the Value . Q. to Charles Roads . What do you know of the Matter ? Roads . On the 27th of January last , I went up to Hounslow on a little Business , and I went with a Friend to the Crown to drink a Glass of Beer , and they were talking of a Gentleman 's House being robbed , and several such Sort of Goods stole , as have been mentioned . Mr - that keeps the Rose and Crown , the Post-house ; he was saying there was a Man came up the Lane , by his House , with a Wrapper of Goods , about Six o'Clock in the Morning ; he said he pitched them upon the R before his House ; he said to him , Does the Windsor Caravan stop at your House ? Says he , I have these Things to send to London : He told him , it did not . With that I said I would go up to the Red-Lion , to see whether this Wrapper or Goods were gone ; by that Means , perhaps , we shall trace it out . So I enquired if there was not a little Man came there yesterday Morning . Says the Landlord , there was a Man brought a Sack with some Goods in it . I asked where it was : He said it was not gone , his Hostler forgot to give it the Caravan ; so I opened it , and I saw in it there was a Blanket tied a cross , and I examined farther ; and there was another Blanket , & c. So I said to the Landlord , I would have you carry them into your Chamber , and if any body comes after them . I would have you stop them . So I acquainted Mr Meade with it , and he dispatched one of his Servants to see if they were his Goods . When we came again to the Red Lion , where the Goods were left , we heard the Prisoner had been there to see after the Sack of Goods left on Monday Morning ; he wondered they did not fond them , for he had been at London , and they were not come : They were directed to be left at one William Barber 's , in Piccadilly . Then we went in Pursuit of this Man the Prisoner ; his Wife gave us Intelligence , that we should find him in such and such Places in London , but could not light of him . Then we heard that he was gone to Gravesend : We went there , but we could not find him . On Saturday was Fortnight there was a Woman to nurse his Wife in her lying in ; and she told me he was to be at her House on Saturday Night late , or on Sunday Morning : So we waited till Seven o'Clock in the Morning ; we waited till the Fore-door was open . I said , now is the time , let us go . So I drew my Hanger , and put it under my Coat ; so his Wife asked who was there : I told his Wife I had a Letter for him : I said I came from a Woman the Nurse down at Thistleworth : I heard the Child say , Mamme , and Dadde ; then I thought I was sure of him . I said to his Wife , where is your Husband ? She said , he is not here . I said , I had heard the Child cry Dadde ; so I examined the Bed , and looked at the Feet of the Bed , and I saw his Clothes ; I put my Hanger under the Bed , and said I would cut him if he did not come out ; so I touched him at his Neck , and drew Blood ; he said , Do n't kill me , do n't hurt me , I am a dead Man ; says I , I wo n't hurt you ; but if you put up your Hand to do any Thing , I 'll cut it off ; he was in his Shirt ; he said when he was dressing , I wonder such a Man as you should turn Thief-catcher . I said I would have gone a thousand Mile to apprehend such a Rogue as you , you have committed many Robberies ; he said if he had Pistol he would have shot me dead ; I said , would you have shot me that am an innocent Man ? he said , my Life is as dear to me as your 's , and I would have shot you dead : he confessed that he had sewed the Feather bed , and that he was in a great Passion with his Wife , that she did not let him have the Thread soon enough . Q. to the Prisoner . Would you ask any Questions of this Witness ? Prisoner . My Lord , I know he is a foresworn Wretch ; he said for the Sake of the Reward he would go all over the World to catch Thieves . I told him before the Justice I did not break the House open , and I told him who it was I had a Suspicion of , because they brought the Goods to me , and I would have made myself the King 's Evidence , but the Justice would not admit me . Roads . He did deny the Robbery when I took him . James Hobbs . About the 26th of January , I was going to work betimes in the Morning ; I met the Prisoner with a Sack upon his Shoulder , but what he had in it , I could not tell : on the 27th I went up to Hounslow along with Mr Meade 's Man , and saw it opened , that I suppose was the same . Q . Are you sure it is the same ? Hobbs . I ca n't say that . Q . Does the Prisoner live at Hounslow ? Hobbs . He lived in Warden lane just by me . Q . Was you in the House when the Man found the Bed and the white Blanket that was found with the Prisoner . Hobbs . Yes , my Lord . Q . Do you know any thing farther ? Hobbs . I saw the Quilt and Blankets shot out of the Sack . Q . Who was that Sack showed to ? Hobbs . It was carried up before the Justice ; when there was a Report of the House being robbed , he persuaded me to say it was some Wood he had carried in that Sack ; I told him to go Home and consult his Pillow , and not be ruled by any Body ; when he went from my House , he said it was better to hear the Birds sing than the Mice squeek . Q. to Joseph Hitherington . Did you receive the Sack . Hitherington . I received the Sack with these Goods in it , to be sent by the Maidenhead Caravan . Q . Where do you live ? Hitherington . At Hounslow , Sir . Q . Where was it to go to ? Hitherington . It was directed to be left at the Black Bear in Piccadilly Q . Who was it directed to ? Hitherington .

Yes , my Lord , we had the Constable and opened the Sack , and looked all the things over ; there were two Blankets , two Pillows , a white Quilt , and Red Curtains , belonging to the Red-bed , I think there were four . Q . What did you do with these Goods after you had thus searched ? Ryder . We tied them up again , and left them at the Ostry , till we had consulted with my Master , and they were carried before the Justice of Peace . Q . Who was present when they were carried before the Justice of Peace ? Ryder . William Ashley and Roads . Q . Was the things produced before the Justice of Peace , these things that you opened , that Charles Roads found there ? Ryder . My Lord , I do n't know , I did not go with them to the Justice 's , but Charles Roads did . Q. to Charles Roads . Was you present when the Sack was opened before the Justice of Peace ? Roads . No , my Lord , I was before the Justice , but they had opened them before they called me in ; I saw the Sack at the Door and I know it to be the same Sack . Q. to William Ashley . Was you present when these Goods were brought to Mr Clithroe 's , the Justice of Peace . Ashley . I was present at Hounslow Inn when the Sack was opened , and saw them when carried before the Justice , and turned them out of the Sack myself . Q . Do you know whose Goods they were ? Ashley . I believe them to be my Master Meade 's . Q. to Hitherington . Was the Sack William Ashley took from Hounslow , the same Sack the Prisoner delivered to you ? Hitherington It was , my Lord . Q. to the Prisoner . You hear what hath been sworn , what have you to say in your Defence ? Prisoner . My Lord , I know nothing of breaking open the House ; I never heard of it till Tuesday Morning . Q . Have you any Witness to call ? Prisoner . No , my Lord , but I hope you will hear me speak . There was one Anthony Larkin and Thomas Scawen a Drover ; Thomas Scawen had a Mother going into an Almshouse , as she had some Goods he-said he would let me have them reasonable , but I must bring them off privately . Q . Who were these People ? Prisoner . Thomas Scawen is a Drover , and Anthony Larkin a Shoemaker , he said on Monday Morning he would bring some things to me if I could pay him ; I worked that Night to get some Work finished ; about Twelve , or a little after , they brought a Bed , and those things in a Sack , with that I went up and told my Spouse they had brought such and such things ; she desired I would have nothing to do with it , she believed they were stole . On Monday Morning I told them that they were actually stole , and Larkin told me if I did not take Care , they would be found out , and told me to keep them privately : On Monday Morning I took them away from my House to carry them to Hounslow , to send them out of the Way ; I told him as I had been at Sea before , I would not go again ; I was a Stranger in the Place , I knew nothing of the House . Court . Then you have no Witnesses to prove this ? Prisoner . No , my Lord . Guilty of single Felony only , acquitted of the Burglary . [ Transportation .

What was the Prisoner accused of there ? Mr Mc Ovey speaks of a Watch , a Pair of Buckles , and Cloak , & c. Lewis . She at first strictly denied it , then afterwards she made an open Confession ; she said she was sorry she had taken them ; she believed she was undone , but she sold them to one in Newgate , the Watch for 18 s. and the Buckles for 9 s. which she did not deny before the Justice of Peace the last Night . The Prisoner at the first denied it , but when Mrs Mc Ovey was gone , she asked me for half a Quartern of Brandy . I said I would give it her . Then she said she would confess it : She confessed she sold the Watch for 18 s. and the Buckles for 9 s. Q . Had she any Cloak upon her Back ? Lewis . Yes , Sir ; I think it was the same Cloak that the Woman mentioned something about ; but particularly I can not tell . Q . Where do you live ? Lewis . In Gravel lane , Houndsditch : I work in Rope-making , and sometimes in Rigging . Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say in your Defence ? Have you any Witness ? Prisoner . My Lord , I was with that Woman about three Months ; I used to borrow her Cloak of her ; she keeps a House for Fellows to come in all Hours of the Night , and it might as well be any body else as me : I know no more of it than this Candlestick . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 134.

Q. to Catharine Bowyer . What do you know with regard to the Prisoner ? Bowyer . Susannah Pymer was a Boarder of mine : We went into the Country together on Saturday : I intended then to stay but till Monday : This Lady came to Town the Tuesday following : I did not come home for two or three Weeks . When I came home on the Friday , as I left my Servant Catharine Price , the Prisoner , to the Care of my House , I gave her eleven Guineas to pay away , and she came back immediately , and told me she had lost one . I was obliged to go out of Town on the Saturday . I came home on Monday Night , and I desired her to give me the Remainder of the Money , and she gave me nine Guineas , and told me , she had changed one for the Use of the House ; and she would give an Account of the Things committed to her Charge . But before I got up in the Morning , she was gone . I must tell you , my Lord , when I came home on Tuesday , I saw the Pint Mug on the Dresser in my Kitchen , and the two large Silver Spoons , which I did not see when I came home ; which she owned before the Justice . She went away on Tuesday Morning . She sent back the two large Silver Spoons , and Pint Mug , by a Porter , on the Wednesday before she was taken up : I took her up after she had sent these Things ; because I lost a great many Things , and I could only judge her to be the Thief . Court . You had not got a Warrant for her , till she had sent these Things ? Bowyer . No , my Lord ; she went to a Man that curls Hair in Holborn , Thomas Brown . Q . How came you to know that she was at Thomas Brown 's ? Bowyer . Thomas Brown sent me that Word by his Apprentice , about Four in the Afternoon , that she was there . Q . Who brought you this Silver Mug , and Spoons ? Bowyer . A Porter , my Lord ; he said he received them from a Woman with a red Cloak . Q . Do you know where the Fringe is ? Bowyer . In Pawn ; but I do n't know where . Q. to Susannah Pymer . Have you had any Conversation with the Prisoner ? or do you know any thing of these Goods charged upon her ? Pymer . The Mug and the Spoons she took out of the House , and sent them back again . Q . Did she send the Thread Fringe back ? Pymer . No , my Lord . Q . What do you know in relation to the Thread Fringe ? Pymer . My Lord , she told me that she had pawned it . Q . Did she tell you for how much ? Pymer . Whether it was eight or nine Shillings , I can not say which . Q . Did she say to whom ? Pymer . No , my Lord ; but to somebody at the Bottom of Gough square . Q . Where did she tell you this ? Pymer . She told me at New-Prison , where she was , that she had pawned a Shirt . When I came out of the Country from Mrs Bowyer , she desired I would let the Maid have every thing she wanted ; and I took Care of the House , and paid every thing myself , I laid out about forty Shillings in Housekeeping , while her Mistress was gone . The Maid took care of the House from Friday till Monday Night ; she provided every thing herself , she laid out about seven Shillings of her own . Q. to Thomas Brown . What have you to say in relation to the Prisoner ? Brown . On Tuesday in the Afternoon I called at Mrs Bowyer 's House , to know whether she wanted me : I heard Mrs Bowyer to say that she had lost a Pint Mug , and two large Silver Spoons . I called between twelve and one o'Clock ; and when she had told me of the Loss of these Things , I left Mrs Bowyer , and went home to my House . I found the Prisoner at my House : She asked me what her Mistress said about her . I told the Prisoner , that her Mistress was very much enraged against her , and would take her up , if she could be found . She desired the Favour of me , if I would be so good , as to let my Apprentice step down , and acquaint her Mistress that she was at my House . Upon this her Mistress came in a Coach along with Mrs Pymer , and desired me to keep the Prisoner till she came back again , for she was going before the Justice . I went up and told the Prisoner , that her Mistress was gone to take out a Warrant for her ; but I did not offer to detain the Prisoner in the least , as I thought I had no Authority . Mrs Bowyer took her at my House . Q . What did she say ? Did she offer to go away ? Brown . No , my Lord ; the Prisoner said she pawned these Things , the Pint Silver Mug , the two large Silver Spoons , while her Mistress was out of Town , for the Use of the House . Q . Had you known the Prisoner any Time ? Brown . Not before she lived with her Mistress . Q . How long had she lived with her Mistress ? Brown . I can not justly say . Q. to Mrs Bowyer . How long has the Maid lived with you ? Bowyer . Since last March , to the best of my Knowledge . Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say for yourself ? and what Witnesses have you to call ? Prisoner . My Lord , I have none here ; I never had any Opportunity to send for any body ; the Plate was pawned for the Use of the House . Court to Mrs Bowyer . She says the Plate was pawned for the Use of the House . Bowyer . My Lord , she had eleven Guineas in her Hands , from Saturday to Monday . Court . Though she had the eleven Guineas , she was not to apply them to the Use of the House by your Leave ; I thought you gave her the eleven Guineas to pay to some particular Person . Bowyer . Yes , my Lord ; but she had changed one . Prisoner . I lived with her from last March , and I wanted Money to make use of : I laid out a great deal of Money , for I never had but 16 s. of her from the Time that I lived with her . Court to Mrs Bowyer . You have not paid her any Wages . Bowyer . She borrowed 16 s. of me , that was all . Upon this Representation of the Prisoner 's receiving little Wages , and her Mistress not being able to prove that she had paid her any except the 16 s. the Prisoner borrowed of her , the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 135.

The Woman and she went up Stairs together ; I stayed the Space of half an Hour , then she came down . I saw she had something in her Apron . I said , I will go . Here , stay a bit , says she ; I 'll go home with you . Says she , I have got some Handkerchiefs gave me ; and Mrs. Thornton will have Part of them ; and the Prisoner sold three of them for 1 s. Q . Was there any put under the Hog-tub ? Barrow . Yes , my Lord ; she crammed one in the Yard , under the Hog-tub . Q . What did she put it there for ? Barrow . For Fear it should be searched , and found about her . I did not know she put it there , till she was took up . Court to the Prisoner . What have you to say in your Defence ? Prisoner . I lived along with this Woman : Upon Candlemas-day we went to drink with this Man that lost the Goods : The Prosecutor sat down upon the Bed with Deborah Barrow , drinking with her ; and they drank half a Pint of Gin out ; and she said she was a-dry , and wanted some Beer ; and they brought a Full-pot of Two-penny up : He desired they might go to Bed together . The Woman said , she had not a Room to let , and they should not ; and we went out of the House together . When I came out , my Garter dropped off ; and before I could pick it up again , they were gone .

The Prisoner when called to the Bar said , that he had but a very short Time to send Sixty-two Miles for his Witnesses ; it was answered that he had Time enough to send for any Witnesses . Francis Sleep . My Lord , I set out from my House on Saturday Afternoon , about Five o'Clock , it might be a little more or less , it was about Dusk . Q . Where did you set out from ? Sleep . From Falconbridge court , in St. Ann 's Parish , in the Liberty of Westminster ; I was going to my own House at Whittlebourgh , in Watford Parish , where my Wife was gone for her Health ; she was very sick , so was my Child ; and between Hoasden green and Stone-bridge I met this young Man , the Prisoner , upon the Road ; I had indeed overtaken a Carter that drove an Hay-Cart , which was upon a little Poney , like my own ; and as the Carter and I were riding together , between Hodsden green and Stone-bridge , this young Man , the Prisoner , met me on the Road ; he comes hollowing in a very bold refractory Manner , with something in his Hand ; and when he came near , I saw it was a Pistol , I thought he had been a drunken Gentleman , he had the Appearance of a Gentleman ; I thought he was drunk and wanted the Road ; I crossed my Horse out of the Way , not designing to contend for the Road , I turned my Horse out of the Way , and he turned his Horse out of the Way to meet me , and swore in a blasphemous Manner , that he would shoot me dead if I did not stop ; d - n your Blood , and a Number of Oaths , if I did not stop he would shoot me dead ; so I stopped immediately , and he presented a Pistol at me , I judged it was rather longer than a common Pistol ; he then demanded my Money , which I gave him . Q . Was it the Length of a Horse-pistol ? Sleep . Not quite so long I believe . When he demanded my Money , I told him I had but little ; I was going to see my Wife , and I had not Occasion for much Money , so I gave him my Money , which was 6 s. it happened to be in my Pocket alone , for I had changed a Guinea that Day , and paid 15 s. for the King 's Tax ; then he asked me for my Watch , and afterwards he demanded my Perriwig ; it was a frosty Night , I desired him not to take my Wig , for I should catch cold ; I told him it would do him very little Service , I did not wear costly Wigs , so for that Reason I obtained my Wig again ; then he went to the other Person in Company , to whom he swore if he stirred a Foot further , he would strike him dead , still joining Oaths to his Words . Q . Was that Menace made to the Carter before he robbed you ? Sleep . During the Time of his robbing me . Court . Then the Carter stood still during the Time he was robbing you ? Sleep . Yes , Sir , he went and demanded Money of him , but I do n't remember that he had any of him . I forgot one thing , my Lord ; before he left me , he insisted upon my swearing I would say nothing of what had past ; I told him I was never used to swear since I was 18 Years of Age , and am now upwards of forty ; I said I would lose my Life rather than I would swear an Oath ; then he left me , and said two others would have robbed me if he had not ; I said then what shall I say if any Body should attack me ; he said , say Thomas , that was the Word , upon that he rode off ; after he had given me that Instruction . I rode forwards towards Harrow ; and in about a quarter of a Mile , I did meet two Persons , who rode swiftly past us , who said nothing to us , nor we to them ; and I judged they were the Highwaymen , and had some Intelligence that they might know that he had robbed me , and so thought it in vain to stop us any more . So I said to the Man in Company , these were the two Men that he told us of , they had the Appearance of Highwaymen ; for 't is not usual for Persons passing in the Night , but they say good Night , or something to that Purpose ; so I apprehended these were the Persons he mentioned ; one was on a black and the other on a white Horse . Q . What Horse was the Prisoner mounted upon ? Sleep . Upon a brown Horse , a very fine one . - I says to the Carter , I 'll follow these two Men , I believe they belong to him , and by following them , perhaps we shall come to the Knowledge of this Person ; so then without going to my House in the Country , I turned back towards London . As soon as I came over against the Place where I was robbed , I heard two Horses jump into the Field , and I could hear the Horses Hoofs trumpting at a great Rate between Edgware and Harrow Road ; I rode on further to Hodsden-green , there I met several Persons that he had attacked , one Man had lost his Horse , and they rode towards London , so did I ; they thought they should overtake him ; but it was all in vain , for he was better mounted than any of them . I rode as far as Paddington , and put up my Horse ; I considered my Wife would be frightened if I did not come , so I went my intended Journey , and got there about Eleven o'Clock at Night . Court . You say it was about the Hour of Five when you set out from Falconbridge-court , and you say you rode about five Miles from thence , between Stone-bridge and Hodsden-green , and the Prisoner came up to you ; as it was dusk , how came you to know that the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person you met ? Sleep . That Person at the Bar was so near me , and the Moon shone so bright , that I could see his Face as plain as I can now . I told the Carter I had seen him before ; I knew the Prisoner a Boy , I knew his Grand-mother , and I am now sure I am not deceived in his Face . I am certain he is the Man . Court . Now , Mr. Sleep , you say it was the 18th of October last ; how long might you take in going from Falconbridge court to this Place where you met him ? Sleep . I ca n't say , I did not ride fast ; I apprehend I was about an Hour in riding of it , hardly so much . Court . You said you should know him again ; and that upon Reflection his Grand-mother you knew , and you knew him a Boy ? Sleep . Yes . Q . When did you see him since the Time you was robbed ? Sleep . My Lord , I knew him to be the Person , by recollecting his Face . Q . Have you your Watch ? Sleep . Yes , I have the Watch that was taken from him , and the Watch I could tell from a Thousand . [ The Watch was produced in Court ] Q . How came you by this Watch now ? Sleep . It was advertised that this Henry Simms was taken , after he robbed me , and he was committed to Bedford-Goal ; there was another Circumstance occurred , that this Person , the very Saturday Night that he robbed me , he came to an Acquaintance of mine in Monmouth street ; they told me that such a Person , Henry Simms , was advertised and taken up for the Highway , I said that is the Person that has robbed me ; says they he was here that very Night he robbed you , and pulled out a Watch , such a Sort of a Watch as you described , and said , Was it not a Pity a Man should die for such a thing as this ? he wanted a Pair of Boots in Monmouth-street , so then I said he was the Person that robbed me , and I had a Desire to go and see whether or no he had my Watch in Possession , but I let the thing lie a considerable Time , till I went into the Country to see my Mother ; so I had the Curiosity to go from Luton to Justice Nodes at Bedford , and after I described my Watch to him , he brought it out . Q . And you swear that is the Watch the Prisoner took from you ? Sleep . Yes , my Lord . Prisoner . My Lord , please to ask him whether he knew me before the Time that the People told him I was there to buy a Pair of Boots . Q. to Mr. Sleep . When did you know him ? Sleep . I knew him when a Boy , by the Name of Henry Simms . Court . You say these People in Monmouth street , they recollected and called him by the Name of Henry Simms ? Sleep . They knew him , my Lord , as well as I. Q . When he robbed you , did you recollect that he was the Person you knew when a Boy , by the Name of Henry Simms ? Sleep . No , I did not , my Lord . Court . Prisoner , have you any other Questions to be asked ? Prisoner . Ask him what Time of the Night it was , whether there was any other Persons nigh at that Time ; whether I hollowed cut or any Pistol fired , or any Person asked him for a Hat or Wig . Q. to Mr. Sleep . Was there any Body near you ? Sleep . There was no Body but the Carter . Court . You say you met several People , did you communicate the Robbery to the People you met ? Sleep . Yes , I told them of the Robbery . Q. to Justice Nodes . Do you know any thing with Relation to the Prisoner 's being brought before you , or conveyed to Bedford Goal , or any thing taken from him ? Justice Nodes . On the 20th Day of October last , I was informed that the Warrington Coach was robbed , and they had taken an Highwayman ; when the Prisoner was taken , there were three Watches taken from him , one was a gold one , and one of the silver ones this Witness came and owned ; when under Examination , the Prisoner confessed that between Harrow on the Hill and London , he had robbed several People . Court . I ask whether the Watch delivered to Francis Sleep was the Watch taken from the Prisoner ? Justice Nodes . I did deliver the Watch taken from the Prisoner , to Mr. Sleep ; when under Examination he did own to me he had robbed several Persons between Harrow on the Hill and London , the 18th of October . Q . Did he sign that ? Justice Nodes . No . Prisoner . I am sure it was not a proper Officer that search 'd me ; I do n't know what they might put into my Pocket . Q. to Mr. Sleep . Is that the Watch you was robbed of ? Sleep . Yes , my Lord , it is . Court to the Prisoner . Would you ask any Questions to the Justice of Peace ? Prisoner . Ask him whether he found that Watch upon me . Court . He does not say that he found it upon you ; but you hear what Mr. Sleep and the Justice has sworn ; Have you any Witnesses to call , or any thing to say in your Defence ? Prisoner . As for bringing of People to my C haracter , 't is only troubling the Court ; but I apprehend the Law is so tenderly made in such Cases , that I do n't think any Jury in the World will bring me in guilty upon this , to have a Bill found against me , when the Witness did not know that I was the Person , till I was at a House buying a Pair of Boots . I shall say no more , my Lord , at present . Court to Mr. Sleep . The People told you that he had produced the Watch ? Sleep . Yes , Sir . Guilty , Death . 150 . + Edmund Henley was indicted with above twenty other Persons , for that he after the 24th of June 1736 , to wit , the 14th of April last , at Northforeland , in the County of Kent , being then and there armed with , and carrying Fire-arms , and other Weapons , to wit , Blunderbusses , Pistols , Guns , Sticks and Clubs , feloniously did assemble themselves together , in order to be aiding and assisting in the clandestine running , landing and carrying away certain uncustomed Goods , ( to wit ) four thousand Pounds Weight of Tea , then imported here from Parts beyond the Seas , for which certain Duties were payable to his Majesty ; to the Terror of the King 's Subjects , to the Hindrance of his Majesty 's Officers of the Customs , in the Execution of their Office ; to the Diminution of the Revenue , against the Statute in that Case made and provided ; against his Majesty 's Peace , his Crown and Dignity . Council . Please your Lordship , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , I am Council in this Cause for the King against Henley the Prisoner at the Bar , who stands indicted of a Felony for being armed , and carrying Fire arms , in order to be assisting in the carrying off of four thousand Pounds Weight of uncustomed Goods ; this Indictment is laid as being against an Act of Parliament of the ninth of his present Majesty ; this was laid to put a Stop to that infamous Practice of Smuggling that has prevailed over the Kingdom ; we shall prove to you , that the Prisoner has been pretty well known for some Years past to be a very notorious Practitioner in smuggling ; he is a Person that has went by the Name of a Captain among them . The particular Fact upon which he now stands indicted was in April last , that he with about thirty other Persons were assembled at Northforeland , there they were armed with Fire-arms , Pistols and Blunderbusses ; their Purpose in coming there was in order to assist , to be helpful in running and landing some Tea , that was brought in a smuggling Cutter , belonging to one King ; they landed about four thousand Weight of Tea , loaded it upon Horses , and proceeded in a Body together ; these People so armed went from the Place where they run this Tea , they kept in a Body together , when they were come to a Place of Safety , then they dispersed , and carried their Goods away to their several Places . Gentlemen , we shall prove that the Prisoner at the Bar was one of these Persons . Council . I am Council for the same Side . Gentlemen , you all very well know the Necessity of publick Prosecutions of this Kind , 't is a Practice of such a Nature , that the Consequences of it are so extensive and obvious , that there is hardly any Ocsion to mention them : it tends in the first Place to the Prejudice of the Fair-Trader , because these Persons not doing Justice to the Publick , are capable of selling Goods at an under Rate , and that Trader , that trades fairly and honestly , must be a Sufferer by this Practice . In the next Place , it immediately tends to the Diminution of the Revenue , and that Diminution does not effect the Crown merely , but it effects the Subjects of Great Britain , because you all know the Duties laid upon those Sort of Goods , are appropriated to answer a particular Part of the national Debts ; the Consequence is , if any Diminution is made upon them , the Legislator must lay new Duties upon the Publick , and it will effect every Man that is to contribute to them . Besides , this Gang of Smugglers are grown to that Pass , that they are too big for the Law itself ; every body knows what Riots , and Tumults , and open Violence in Contempt of the Laws of the Country , and indeed setting the civil Magistrate at Defiance ; therefore Practices of this Kind call upon those entrusted with the Government of the Nation , to look closely into them , and , if possible , put a Stop to the Consequences that result from them . Gentlemen , you perceive by the Act of Parliament , it is an Offence of a peculiar Nature , not an Offence of running Goods , and defrauding the Crown , that has been provided by other Acts of Parliament ; but the Legislature finding that these Fellows were got to that Pass , that it was almost impossible to detect them in the Act of running of Goods , because they were collected together in such formidable Banditties , that no body could detect them to the Satisfaction of a Jury ; therefore the Legislature thought fit to take a Method for preventing this Practice , by anticipating , if I may so say , that Offence : This Act of Parliament makes the Fact of being assembled together armed , in order to purpose the running of Goods , it being an Offence to which the Law hath set a particular Punishment ; therefore there was only that Way Left ; they might be seen armed and assembled , but it was impossible for any body to pry into the Fact , to charge them with the particular Fact of running Goods . The Question upon this Indictment will be , whether or no we shall lay before you a satisfactory Evidence , that this Edmund Henley , who was so notorious in the County of Kent , that , according to my Instructions , he was Captain , and stiled Captain of one particular Gang ; the Question will be , whether we can shew you , according to this Act of Parliament , whether he was actually assembled , with other Persons armed , in order to be assisting in clandestine running of Goods : It happens in this Case that there can be no doubt in the Evidence we shall lay before you because we shall not call Witnesses who were at a Distance , and might mistake the Person , but we happen to have one of the Confederates , who was actually concerned with him , who could not be mistaken with respect to the Prisoner , he being with him in Northforeland , in the County of Kent . Q. to Richard Smith . Do you know the Prisoner ? Smith . Yes , Sir . Q . How long have you known him ? Smith . Six Years . Q . What has been his Employment ? Smith . Smuggling . Q . Did you know him in April last ? Smith . I knew he was concerned in landing Goods at Northforeland ; he there was with a Carbine and Pistol , at the landing of Goods from a smuggling Cutter , belonging to one King . Q .

I was there ; I lived Servant with a Smuggler at that Time ; there was one John Brown , and James Collin , and Thomas Winter , & c. Court . We wo n't ask you particularly of them ? Council . What Quantity of Goods did they land ? Smith . Above thirty hundred , and he , the Prisoner , helped land them , and he had two Brothers down at that Time , and two drove Horses ; he came away with us from the Beach . Council . And he went away with these drove Horses ? Smith . Yes , he did . Council . What was the general Title he passed by there ? Smith . He went by the Name of Captain at Folkstone ; he went by the Name of the Captain of the Irish ; that Gang was called the Irish Gang , and this Man was the Captain of them ; they used to call him Captain Henley . Council . Did you observe him with them ? Smith Yes , he always was very grand , and shewed himself very high . Council . Did he direct the others ? Smith . He always directed the Men he had under him ; there were two Brothers he had . Council . How long was you concerned in landing this Tea ? Smith . About as Hour and half . Council . Was the Prisoner there all the Time ? Smith . Yes , all the Time . Council . Then this Folkstone is a pretty general Place of landing ? Smith . Yes . Council for the Defendant . You say it was in April last ? Smith . It was on or about the 14th of April . Council . What do you mean by about ? Smith . It was either the 13th or 14th of April . Council . What Quantity of these Goods was there ? Smith . About thirty hundred . Council . What time did you meet the Prisoner ? Smith . About Six o'Clock in the Evening . Council . How long did you stay together ? Smith . Till between Twelve and One . Council . Where did he go afterwards ? Smith . I ca n't tell . Council . I think you say you have known him six Years , has he followed no Business , no Shop-keeping Business ? Smith . I have been at his House . Council . How long of your own Knowledge has he kept a Grocer 's Shop ? Smith . I ca n't tell , I never was at his House but once ; he used to come down to the Country . Council . How long did you see him before he carried off these Goods ? Smith . About three Months before , he used to come down to his Brother 's . Council . Pray how far is this Northforeland from London ? Smith . 'T is as far as you can go by Land almost . Council . I do n't know that Country ; Can you tell the Number of Miles ? Smith . It might be 100 Miles , four Score Miles to be sure . Council for the Defendant . Did you see him any other Time before the 14th of April ? Smith . The Day before . Council . You ca n't fix exactly whether it was the 13th or 14th of April ? Smith . I am sure 't was the 14th . Council . Have you ever made a Discovery of this before any Body ? Smith . Yes . Council . You yourself was there among them ? Smith . Yes . Council . You know there is a Reward ? Do n't you know that there is 50 l. belonging to you for discovering your Accomplices ? Smith . No . Council . Where does the Prisoner keep this Grocer 's Shop ? Smith . I ca n't tell directly the Place ? Council . I now ask you whether you speak positively to the 14th of April ? you say you parted the 15th . Smith . We parted the 15th when we came up into the Country ; we parted in Hatfield . Council . How many were assembled together at the Time that you parted ? Smith Seven or Eight of us . Council . Had you Tea then ? Smith . Yes , all of us were armed , and had Tea . Court . Had he two Drove Horses ? Smith . Yes . Court . Who took Care of these Horses ? Smith . His Brothers ; he rode before , and paid the Reckoning at the Houses where we called ; paid the Reckoning for his Brothers and the other Men . Richard Shaw . I keep the Hand and Arm in Barnaby Southwark . Council . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Shaw . Yes . Council . How long have you known him ? Shaw . For two Years ; about two Years ago I sold him a House . Council . Do you recollect seeing of him in any particular Day in April last ? Shaw . He bought a Horse of me on the 10th of April ; and he came the 14th of April , and took him away . Council . At what Time of the Day did he come ? Shaw . I ca n't particularly say , it was a great while ago ; I believe it was before Dinner ; he went out upon the 14th , and came in the 15th . Council . Did he go on Horse-back , or was it a Chaise Horse ? Shaw It was a Chaise Horse , but he rode on Horse back ; and one of the two Days I lent him a Sum of Money . Council . Have you any particular Reason for it ? Shaw . No other Reason but from the Date of the Book ; I am satisfied he was there upon the 14th . Council . What Time might he come back on the 15th ? Shaw . I do n't recollect the exact Time . Council for the King . What Sort of a Horse was it you sold to him two Years ago ? it was a good strong Horse , I suppose , fit to carry a Burthea ? Shaw . Sir , it was fit to carry me . Council . You say one of these Times that he came to you , you lent him a Sum of Money ; how does that appear ? Shaw . Because I had it , or I could not have let him have it . Council . You say he came the 10th , and on the 14th ; was it upon the Day he went out ; or the Day he came in , you lent she Sum of Money ? Can you produce that Note ? Shaw . No . Council . If I understood you , he bought the Horse of you the 10th of April , and you say that Horse was taken away the 14th , do you speak this of your Memory or Book ? Shaw . From my Memory and Book . Council . When did you look upon your Book , to refresh your Memory ? Shaw . I ca n't say , perhaps it might be two Months ago , I was overhalling of them . Council . Have you not looked at those Entries these two Months ? when did you see them ? Shaw . It might be six Weeks or a Month ago ; I ca n't be punctual to the Day . Council . I ask you whether you have looked within this Month ? Shaw . Yes , I have . Council . How came you to say two Months ? Shaw . If I have looked upon them within this Month , I have within two Months . Council . True , but you might have brought it a little nearer . Shaw . I believe I have looked upon these Entries within this Week . Council . I ask you whether you speak from your Memory or these Entries ? Shaw . I speak from my Memory and these Entries . Council . Can you speak from your Memory without referring to your Book , of his being at your House the 14th of April ? Shaw . I believe I can without referring to the Book . Council . Now I would ask you whether there is any Entry of this Horse the 14th of April , and who it was delivered to ? Shaw . It was delivered to Captain Henley . Council . Oh , Sir , I did not understand , then he belongs to some Regiment ; he was a Horse Officer ; he had a Number of Horses of you , had he not ? here was the Chaise Horse , and another , you sold him ; so he is a Captain , I thought he had been a Grocer ? Shaw . He was called Captain at our House . Council . What was the Chaise Horse worth ? Shaw . Twelve Pounds . Court . By whom was the Horse brought the 10th ? Shaw . He brought the Horse himself , and had him on the 14th . Jonathan Butson . I live in Barnaby-street . I am Servant in the last Witness ; I have lived with him about a Twelve Month . Council for the Defendant . Do you know the Prisoner ? Tell what you know of that Matter ; upon what Account did he use your Master 's House ? Batson . He bought a Horse of us the 10th of April . Council . How long did it stand in your Master 's Stable ? Batson . It stood till the 14th ; he came to look at it between the 10th and 14th , to look at it once or twice ; the 14th I got him a Chaise , and he went out and came in the 15th . Council . How long did the Horse stay in your Stable afterwards ? Batson . Till the 18th . Council . Is that writing in that Book your own writing ? Batson . This is my true Account . Council . When did you write that down ? Batson . I wrote it when he came in . Council for the King . Will you take upon you to say , that every Entry that is made there is your 's ; that you wrote this upon the and 14th of April ? Batson . Yes , Sir . Council . Do you use constantly to make an Entry of every Horse that comes in ? Batson . Commonly . Council . How came it in your Book ? There is no Notice of any thing in your Book from February to April . You say , you came in February ; there are Entries made to July ; then comes an Entry in another Hand , in October and November : Then you go back again from April the 10th ; you have Captain Henley 's Court , as you express it . Q. to William Lepard . How came that Note in your Hand ? Lepard . It was given me by the Prisoner ; and I went to the Gentleman , Mr. Riley , and he accepted it ; he said it was his Note . Council . When did the Note come to your Hand ? Was there any Debt owing to you ? Lepard . He owed me about eight Pounds for Goods sold Council . Why is not Mr Riley here ? Lepard . He is ill a-bad , or he would have been here ? Council . It should be proved , that the Note was given by Mr Riley that Day ; this Note might have been signed at Northforeland , as well as London . Have you been with Mr. Riley this Morning ? Lepard . Yes , Sir ; in order to be a Witness . Council . What is the Reason he gives why he does not come ? Lepard . That he is very ill , he is in a Sweat a-bad ; he attended here all Day yesterday . Council . Do you know Mr. Riley 's Hand-writing ? Lepard Yes , Sir ? Council . Mr. Riley must be a very odd Man not to pay a Note of five Guineas in a Year 's Time . Does this import the Time when he gave it . You produce it as a conclusive Evidence , that on the 14th of April the Prisoner was in Town ; which I can by no Means admit of ; that Note might have been signed at Northforeland , as well as at London . Q. to John Harrison . How long have you known the Prisoner ? Harrison . I live by the Seven Dials . I have known him four Years . Council . Was he a Customer of your 's . Harrison . Yes , Sir . Council . Do you remember seeing of him at any Time about April last ? Harrison . I am a Peruke maker ; he bought a brown Bob Peruke of me ; at the Time when I carried the Wig home , I think it was about the 12th of April . Council . What Day did you carry the Wighome ? Harrison . I ca n't be positive at in the Day : but by carrying a Wig to fit a Person that came from Newmarket Races . Council . Can you tell how near the 15th of April ? Harrison . I tell you , Sir ; I looked in the Almanack ; yesterday . Morning , and see the Time of the Race was about the 13th of April ; it was about the 12th or 13th of April : it was the first or second Sunday , I ca n't tell which . Council . Did you see him the Day after you delivered the Wig . Harrison . I think I did . Council for the King . So the Prisoner bespoke his Wig a Week before the Person that came from New-market Races . I understood at the first that the Prisoner bespoke his Wig one Day , and the , Gentleman the next . Harrison . It might be a few Days I ca n't be positive . Council . Was it not two or three Days before this Person came up from the Races at Newmarket ? I do n't know whether you are acquainted with New-market ; because I believe their Races hold the whole Month of April Court . Are you positive you saw the Prisoner the Day after the Wig was delivered ? Harrison . I am pretty positive of that . - Kelley , the Lawyer . It was but yesterday Morning I looked over my Book cursorily , to see if I could find any Entry or Transaction with the Prisoner on the 14th of April ; he called on me in the Morning , my Wife being advised by her Physician to go into the Country for the Air , I asked him about a Chaise , and he recommended me to the Red-lion in the Borough ; there we had a Pint of Wine : He lent me his House almost every Night , and I returned again in the Morning : I believe , upon my Oath , I saw him almost every Day ; he dined with me , he and his Wife , the first of April . I believe I saw him the whole Month of April . Council . Can you be very sure the Defendant was with you at the Red-lion ? Kelly . He was , to the best of my Memory ; and it was upon his Recommendation that I went to hire the Chaise . Council . Can you remember who else was with you ? Kelley . I believe the Man of the House was there . Q. to Aaren Cappadocia , Esq : Do you know the Prisoner ? Mr Cappadocia . I know him to be a very honest Man . Council . How long have you known him ? Mr. Cappadocia . About three Years . I know nothing more than as honest Man , industrious if I could serve him I should be glad to serve him , because I believe him to be an honest Man . Council . What Business is he ? Mr. Cappadocia . A Grocer . If I want my thing at my House , I have it of him : If it was five or six hundred Pounds , he should have it for any Time . Council . Where do you live ? Mr. Cappadocia . I lived in Cavendish square ; from thence I have moved again to the City : I went to the other End of the Town for my Health . Council . You did not live nearer to the Prisoner than Cavendish street ? Mr. Cappadocia . I lived in Broad-street . Council . How come your Acquaintance ? Mr. Cappadocia . I ca n't recollect that . Council . I want to know whether you did meet him often or not , or whether you only knew him as a Grocer , serving your Family ; what Title did , he go by at your House ? Mr. Cappadocia . Mr. Henley . Q. to Benjamin Axford . Where do you live ? Axford . I live in Wood-street . Council . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Axford . Yes , Sir , I have known him eight or ten Years , and he always had a good Character ; I have sold him a great many Goods , and he always paid me very honestly ; he dealing Cloth . Council . He is a Grocer , is he not ; how came he to deal in Cloth ? Axford . From Holland he brought over Irish-Cloth . Council . Did he deal in Tea ? Axford . I have sold him Tea . Council . Did you never buy Tea of him ? Axford . Yes , I have bought and sold him Tea . Council . Did you hear of his being a Smuggler ? Axford . I have heard of it formerly . Valentine Husband . I have known the Prisoner about three Years , the Man always behaved very well in the Neighbourhood . Council for the Defendant . Do you believe him to be an honest Man , do you think so ? Husband . Yes . Council for the King . Do you believe him to be a Smuggler , Sir . Husband . Sir , common is not to be regarded . Q. to Jacob Pruser . How long have you known him ? Pruser . Between three and four Years . Council . What Business are you ? Pruser . A Sugar . Council . What is his general Character ? Pruser . An exceeding good Character as any one in our Neighbourhood ; he has bought Goods of me , and paid me honestly ; I have given him Credit and he has paid me honestly . Council for the King . Did you ever hear he was suspected of Smuggling ? Pruser . The People will report Things . Council . The People will report it . Christopher Pearson . I have know the Prisoner five or six Years , I never had any Conversation , with him with Regard to his Trade ; he has bought of me several Parcels of Linen , sometimes ten , sometimes fifteen , sometimes twenty Pounds worth ; he has in that Respect behaved very honestly to me . Council . Did you never hear he was suspected of being a Smuggler ? Pearson . No , Sir . Council . Do you live near him ? Pearson . I live in Wood street . Q. to - Setretaree . What Character does the Prisoner bear among the People that you know ? Setretaree . He has the Character of a very honest Man . Council . Is he a Captain , pray ? Setretaree . I never heard he was called Captain , or counted a Smuggler . Q. to Jasper Smith . How long have you known him ? Smith . Seven Years ; he lodged at my House six Months . Council . What is his general Character ? Smith . A very good one ; I have bought Pieces of Cloth of him , and I have bought Cheese and Butter of him . Peter Dean . I have known him ten Years ; I have laid out many a fair Pound with him . [ As Richard Smith was the only Witness called to support the Prosecution . Thomas Staples and William Thomas were called upon to Smith 's Character ] Q. to Thomas Staples . How long have you known Smith ? Staples . For two Years and an Half ? Council . What is the general Character that he bear ? Staples . As to that I can say but little , one way or another , but he is not a Man that ever I had a great Opinion of . Council . I ask you upon your Oath , whether he is a Man to be credited ? Staples . I rather think he is not . Council . What is the general Character of Smith in his Neighbourhood ? Staples . Not a very good one . Council for the King . I suppose not a very good one , because he appears an Accomplice with these Smugglers . Staples . I believe once , Sir , he stopped a Man upon the Highway , and took a Watch from him . Council . Was he ever prosecuted for it ? was you concerned with him ? Staples . No , Sir . Council . How came you to suspect it then ? Staples . Because he brought it to me ; he told me to the best of my Knowledge , that he had taken a Watch from the Man , or he gave it him , I can not say which , he told me it belonged to a Gentleman whose Name was Hammon . Council for the King . Then if I understand you , the Man had given you the Watch ; why surely you could not be a Man of so bad a Character , that any Man would come to you , and tell you he had stole a Watch , and offer it to you ? Staples . The Reason that he did it , he offered the Watch to another Man before he came to me ; he brought it to me to send it to the Gentleman the Owner . Council for the King . Now you and I differ very much ; that seems to be a very honest Act to return the Man the Watch : Then you would insinuate from this round about Story , that this Man stole a Watch ; and you having such a Character in the Country , that you was a proper Person to bring stolen Goods to : This is the History of you and your Neighbourhood . Staples . I keep a Publick-House , rent 177 l. a Year ; and likewise keep a Turnpik . Q. to William Thomas . Do you know the Witness . Smith ? What is his general Character ? Thomas . He has a very bad Character , he robbed Mr. Hammon . Council . Do you know that he robbed Mr Hammon ? Thomas . No , but I saw the Goods upon him , and he owned it . Council . Is he a Man to be credited ? Thomas . No , he is a Fellow of a very bad Character . Council . Do you believe the Witness to be a Smuggler ? Thomas . Yes . Council . Do n't you think then he was acquainted with the Smugglers ? Do n't you believe he can tell the Truth who was a smuggling with him ? So because you know him to be a Smuggler , you do n't think he is to be believed , because he says any Body else is so ; as he enters so particularly into the Character of the Witness , we shall give an Account of this honest Gentleman , the Prisoner , that we fancy may not be entirely to his Satisfaction . Q. to Thomas Care . Are you acquainted with the Prisoner at the Bar ? Care . In March , or April last , was the first of my particular Acquaintance with him . Council . What Character did he bear ? Care . He was counted a Smuggler . Council . Did not your Acquaintance with him begin upon that Account ? Care . I never did smuggle with him ; I have been a Smuggler myself ; he was counted a Smuggler . Q. to Henry Pile . Do you know the Prisoner ? What is his Character with relation to smuggling , and running of Goods ? Pile . He has a great Character for smuggling , and running of Goods : I have had Informations against him . Council . What are you ? Pile . I am an Officer in the Customs . Q. to George Walker . Are you acquainted with Shaw , that keeps the Hand and Arm in Barnaby-street ? What Character has he ? Walker . I had an Information against his House ; I ca n't tell any otherwise . Council . What are you ? Walker . I am an Officer of the Customs : I had an Information against his House ; but I found nothing . Council for the King . I must beg your Lordship , and Gentlemen of the Jury , to take notice that the Fact we charge the Prisoner with , is sworn directly and positively by an Accomplice with himself , who could not but know whether he was or was not there , let his general Character be what it will , in the Manner of his dealing with other People ; there is plain and direct Proof the Prisoner is guilty of this Fact , whatever other People believe of him , that are his Friends and Neighbours . The Defence they have set up is , that he was in another Place at the Time when he was concerned in the landing of these Goods : For that Purpose they have produced one Shaw , who tells you he keeps a Publick house in Southwark ; that he has kept the Publick-house for three Years , and he has known the Prisoner for two Years ; he sold him a Horse , and upon the 10th of April last he bought a Horse at his House ; he went out the 14th , and back again the 15th of April ; and , to confirm this , he appeals to his Stable-keeper . But observe , that he himself tells you , that the Prisoner is a Captain ; he passes among themselves and his own Friends by the Name of Captain , when he is in no Regiment . You see , Gentlemen , that he deals in Horses with this Man pretty much : This Account that the Man himself gives of his House , pretty much corroborates what by the Witness we called to the general Account of it . Shaw , he believes it to be the 14th of April , from his Book , and his own Memory ; he plays backward and forwards , with relying upon one and another : In this likewise he tells you , he went away from his House in the Morning before Dinner , and came back again the 15th . To corroborate him , comes the Hostler and the Stable-book . The Hostler tells you , he knows the Prisoner , but he has not lived above Twelve Months in the House : He entirely grounds himself upon his Stable-book , where he had entered , Captain Henley came there the 10th : The Entry is produced , I wish you would look at it ; because I think it is difficult to make any thing by that Entry , it comes in very oddly . But , Gentlemen , he contradicts his Master . In another Part of his Evidence , he tells you , it was not till the Afternoon , the 14th of April , he went away . It is not impossible , but that a Man might be in Southwark in the Morning the 14th of April , and a smuggling the 14th of April too . The Master says he went away in the Morning , the Hostler in the Afternoon ; and he builds the whole of his Evidence upon what he finds upon an Entry in his Stable-book , which may answer any Purpose he may apply it to ; for I believe fearce any Man in the Kingdom can understand it . As to the Note Mr. Riley is said to give to Mr. Henley the 14th of April ; he produces no Sort of Evidence ; they could not make it Evidence ; the Gentleman that gave it does not appear : Supposing it might be dated the 14th of April , it might be at Northforeland , as well as at another Place ; so that Evidence is to have no Place at all . The next Person produced , he tells you he is a Peruke-maker . Some time in April last the Prisoner bespoke a Bob-wig of him ; which Bob wig he delivered to him ; the same time he received Orders to make a Wig for another Person : He says the first was in April , and , as near as he can guess , it was about the 12th . The Circumstance upon which he would pin this upon that Time of the Month is , that this other Person came from Newmarket Races , and what he grounded his Assertion upon , was his looking upon the Almanack ; but he does not tell you why he is apt to believe that Person was come from the Races : If he came from the Races , he must come from the Races before the Races began : He speaks positively to nothing at all ; he does not fix it certain to any Day . The next Witness , Mr. Kelley , he has looked over his Book , as it is very natural for him to make Entries : all he says out of that Book is , that he went to the Red-lion to hire a Chaise ; he finds he was at the Red-lion the 14th of April ; there he spent a Shilling : There is no Entry that Mr Henley was there with him ; and if Mr Henley was there with him , it would be very material , if they could prove positively , that he was at the Red-lion that Day : Mr Kelley is induced to believe Mr Henley was there with him . This is the only Evidence set up in Defence by the Prisoner , and these , by collecting of them , do n't exactly tally one with another ; these Circumstances , so connected together , do n't seem to have any natural Cohesion at all ; but these are the Circumstances to take off the Weight of a positive Evidence of a Person that was aiding and assisting in his Company . The Evidences they have called , I do n't impeach their Characters at all , that he has had Dealings with them , and he has paid for what he has bought of them ; and therefore , upon their Dealings , they have no reason to suspect but he is an honest Man : All that being allowed , it does not prove , he does not smuggle : And especially most of these Gentlemen , when they came to be asked , could not but acknowledge that he had the common Reputati on of a Smuggler . Now common Fame is no Proof ; but common Fame will produce a strong Suspicion upon a Man , when he is charged with a positive Fact . What they have farther attempted , was to impeach the Character of a Witness called for the King . This they have done by the Oath of one Man , who tells you , that he do n't think this Man upon his Oath is to be believed , because he brought him a Watch , that he said a Gentleman had gave him , and that he did not believe it was rightly come by ; and Smith , the Witness , wanted him to send it to the Gentleman that it belonged to . Now that , Gentlemen , I will leave for your Consideration , whether there is any Foundation to imagine that can be a Reason why the Man may not be credited upon his Oath . The next , Mr. Thomas , he tells you he do n't know Smith 's Face , but he knows his Actions ; he has a Hearsay , but he ca n't tell upon who , for he do n't know his Face ; and he believes this Man was capable of some particular Fact , and which , if true , he must try after another Manner ; and this is his Ground , why this Man , that he never saw his Face , is not to be believed . These are Facts to take off the Weight of what we have laid before you on the Behalf of the Crown ; you know the Danger of these Kind of Practices , and I hope you will give your Verdict accordingly .

What did he say ? Billings He said his Father had fetched it out of Pawn , for five and twenty Shillings ; I gave him a Guinea and a half for it , and he cheated the Prisoner out of a Crown of it , for he gave him a Crown less than I gave him ; when the Constable came to me , I delivered the Clock last Tuesday . [ The Clock was produced in Court ] Franket the younger . The Prisoner brought this Clock to my Father , and he lent him Money upon it . Q . When did he come to your Father to lend him Money upon this Clock ? Franket About three Weeks ago the Prisoner came to my Father , and told him he had a Clock in Pawn for 16 s. which was his Mother 's ; my Father went with the Prisoner to get it out of Pawn , and they brought the Clock back with them . Q . When the Clock was brought back , what then ? Franket . When the Clock was brought back , my Father made the 16 s. up a Guinea . Q . Did your Father give the Remainder in your Presence ? Franket . I did not see him . Q . What did they do afterwards ? Franket . The Prisoner at the Bar came several Times to my Father , and wanted more Money upon it , but my Father said he would have no more to do with it ; so the Prisoner came afterwards to fetch the Clock ; he said he would let him have what Money he advanced for it ; and my Father sent me as a Security along with him ; to bring his Money back again . Court . You went with him , where did you go ? Franket . As we were going along the Street , he ( the Prisoner ) said he would not carry it to a Pawnbroker 's , they would not let him have so much Money upon it , so he would sell it out right . Q . Where did you go then ? Franket . So Mr Horn made Answer , and said he could carry him to an honest Person 's House , that would give him as much as any Body ; so we went to Mary Billings 's House ; he said if I could get three or four Shillings to buy him some Victuals , besides what would pay my Father , I might have the rest ; he did not go with me to sell the Clock , because he had never a Hat , but stood over the Way ; while we were dealing about the Clock , Mary Billings asked whose Clock it was , she asked me who it belonged to , and I showed her the young Man . Mary Billings . I would not have gave a Shilling for it had I seen the young Man . Franket . She gave me a Guinea and a Half , and I gave him 26 s and kept 5 s for myself . Q . Did you tell him what you sold it for ? Franket . No . he asked me no Questions , but was very well satisfied Court . This is a bad way of dealing , you make yourself a Party . Prisoner . He told me he sold it for no more than five and twenty Shilling . Q . What is the Prisoner ? Franket . He was an Apprentice by us in Red-lyon-Square . Horn . About a Fortnight or three Weeks ago , I went into Franket 's for a Pint of Beer ; when I came in , young Franket and the Prisoner were going to pawn this Clock . Q . Did you know the Prisoner before ? Horn . Very slightly ; I never was in his Company . Q . What Discourse had you with the Prisoner at the Bar ? Horn . None at all , my Lord ; Mr. Franket desired . I would go with them ; the Prisoner said he believed he could not pawn it for so much as would pay Mr. Franket , and he said he would sell it ; so I told him of a Person that I had known a great while , that would give as much as any Body ; so accordingly I went to this Gentlewoman 's Husband , but he was not at Home , but the Gentlewoman was , so I went and shewed him the House ; so Mrs Billings gave him a Guinea and an Half for it . Q . Did he say any thing else going along ? Horn . No , my Lord . Q . Was there any Question asked by Mrs Billings , when she bought it ? Horn . While she was giving him the Money , says she , whose Clock is it , is it your own ? is it that young Man 's that stands over the Way ? then she made Answer again , he is a Clock-maker ; says Franket the younger , he is , for he has a green Apron on . Q . When you came back again , what did he do with the Money ? Horn . Whether he gave it his Father , or what , I ca n't tell ; when we all came back , he ( the Prisoner ) was very free , and offered to treat me at Mr. Franket 's House , with Half a Crown 's worth of Punch . Andrew Franket , sen . The Prisoner came to my House along with a Neighbour , about three Weeks ago , with a Shoemaker . Q . Did he bring any thing with him ? Franket . He had a Pint of Beer , and said he was almost starved , and had not a Shoe upon his Feet , and he wanted Money to fetch a Clock out of pawn , that he had made almost all himself ; he said if I would do it for him , he should be bound to pray for me as long as he lived . Q . Where did he say the Clock was pawned ? Franket . At one Singleton 's a Pawnbroker . Q . What did the Prisoner say of his Mother ? Franket . That his Mother was dead ; I went along with him to Singleton 's , whereof they would not let me see it , before I paid the Money down , so I paid 16 s. and one Shilling for the use of it ; it was pawned in his own Name , and he said it was his own Clock . Q . What did you do with the Clock ? Franket . I brought it Home ; he says I shall be pretty well when I have Shoes and Stockings ; I made it up a Guinea to buy him some Shoes and Stockings ; I drawed him but one Pint of Beer ; I told him to go and lay it out for himself ; I brought the Clock Home , about three or four Days after he comes to me himself , and he said , Mr Franket , I do not know why you should be afraid to trust him , you have three or four times the Worth in your Hands than what I owe you : he would have sold it for four or five Shillings more , but I would not have it ; I said he might take it , and do what he would with it . Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say in your Defence , in Answer to this Charge ? Prisoner . Nothing at all . Q . Have you any Witnesses ? Prisoner . I have not seen any one Soul that I know .

Jane Perindine was indicted for stealing one pair of Brass ' Candlesticks , value 3 s. the Goods of James Tempest , February 21 . Q. to James Tempest . What have you to say against the Prisoner ? Tempest . On Saturday last , about two o'Clock in the Afternoon , she and her Husband came into my Shop . Q . What Shop do you keep ? Tempest . A Broker 's Shop in Silver street , Golden-square . They took up a Poker , and cheapened it ; we did not agree ; Then they cheapened a Coffee-pot , and he bought it , and paid me for it . After he had bought that , my Lord , he asked for a Tea-kettle ; he took up an old brass one that was not good enough , she wanted a better ; Then they cheapened half a Dozen of Knives and Forks , and then they asked for Pewter spoons , and bought them , and paid me for them ; He bought a Coffee-pot , a Tea kettle , six Knives and Forks , and two Pewter-spoons : Then they went away . When I went to put up my Things , and they were gone away , they had not been gone long , a little Boy at home says , the Gentlewoman has got a Pair of Candlesticks under her Cloak ; I told the Boy to step after her : The Boy ran down James street , and the Boy said , Madam , I believe you have got something more than your own . Says she , I am a very honest Woman . She comes hastily to my Shop again , and from under her Cloak she draws out a Pair of Candlesticks . Q . Where did she put them ? Tempest . She put them upon a Pair of Chest of Drawers , and said they are there ? Q . What then ? Tempest . That 's all that I know . Council for the Defendant . I think you say that both Husband and Wife came into your Shop , and they cheapened your Goods . I would ask you , among those different Things , did not the Husband or Wife cheapen the Candlesticks ? Tempest . No , Sir . Council Well , but , Sir ; had you not at this Time in your Shop a Boy ? Now did the Wife say nothing to the Boy in relation to those Candlesticks ? Tempest . Not as I know of . Council . Where did those Candlesticks first of all stand ? Tempest . They stood upon the Window on the Left-hand . Council . As to these Things , I think there was a Dispute , whether he should pay 10 s. 6 d. or a 11 s. I would ask you how far Distance the Woman was gone when you went out of the Shop ? Tempest . I never saw her till she had been gone a great Way . Council . Did not the Buy say to her , you have taken away a Couple of Candlesticks among the rest of the Things ? Tempest . I heard him say this , they are under her Cloak . Council . Did not the Woman say , I thought the Candlesticks had been agreed for and paid for by my Husband ? When you came before the Justice of Peace , did not the Boy say before the Justice , that the Woman cheapened the Candlesticks ? Now , Sir , did not you check him , or rebuke him , for saying that the Woman had cheapened the Candlesticks ? The Justice asked the Boy whether she had cheapened the Candlesticks ; and the Boy said , Yes ; for 3 s. Did not the Boy say before the Justice , that she had talked about the Price ? Tempest . No . Council . I have several Witnesses that the Boy said she had cheapened the Candlesticks , and you rebuked him for mentioning of it . I would ask you another Question . This Woman took these Things with the rest , and they were under one Arm , and the rest of the Things under the other Arm ; did you see the Candlesticks under her Arm ? Tempest . I did not pull up her Cloak in the Street ; in Fact , she ran too fast for me . Johanna Turnwell . On Saturday in the Afternoon , I had occasion to open my Window to look at something ; and I saw the Prisoner at the Bar coming down from Mr. Tempest 's Shop , with a Tea-kettle and Coffee pot ; she called and asked her Husband if he had got the Spoons : Her Husband said they were in the Coffee pot . After they were gone out , I saw Mr. Tempest in a Hurry ; in a very little Time I saw the Prisoner came back very fast , and set down a Pair of Candlesticks by a Chest of Drawers . Q . Do you live opposite ? Turnwell . My Window faces Mr. Tempest 's Shop . Council . You saw her set them down ; do you remember where she took when from which she set down ? Turnwell . I did not mind that . Council . Do you remember that she said that she thought her Husband had agreed for them ? Turnwell I did not hear that . Council . Mr. Tempest was in a great Passion ; was he not ? Turnwell . No , I thought he looked pleasant . Council . Do n't you remember before the Justice the Boy said , that she herself said she thought her Husband had paid for them ? Do you remember the Boy 's saying , she had cheapened the Candlesticks ? Turnwell . I think the Boy said she had cheapened the Candlesticks , and his Aunt allowed them for 3 s. Council . Recollect Mr. Tempest did not upon this Occasion rebuke the Boy , and seem to be angry with him ; he said 3 s. was too small , and he was a Blockhead for saying so . [ No Answer to this Question by the last Witness ] Q. to Charles Bird . What do you know of this Matter ? Bird . Please your Honour , I was coming by , and I wanted to buy a Pair of Bellows ; seeing a Pair hang up at Mr. Tempest 's Shop , when I came to cheapen them , Mrs. Tempest said a Woman had taken a Pair of Brass Candlesticks away , and Mr. Tempest was gone out after her . By and by in comes the Woman and Mr. Tempest , and she puts them down upon the Drawers : There they are says she , why do you charge me with them ? Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say in your Defence ? Prisoner . I went into the Shop , my Lord , on Saturday , as I had done in other Shops before , and cheapened these Candlesticks : The Boy told me they were 3 s. I was gone to look at a Coal-box , and I set down the Candlesticks ; I let them alone till I had looked for a Coffee pot and Tea-kettle some Things we could not agree for as to Price , and I laid them down : We agreed for several Goods , and my Husband paid 11 s. We were in a Hurry , and came away . Q. to Mr. Chapman . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Chapman Yes , Sir . Council . Where do you live ? Chapman .

Chapman Her Character at that Time was exceeding good , and she behaved in that Service better than others had done before her . Q. to Mr. Brett . How long , Sir , have you known the Prisoner ? Brett I have known her for about three Months . Council . What is your Station ? Brett I belong to the Prince of Wales . Q . What Office there ? Brett I belong to the Beer-Cellar . Council . During the Time she was in the Prince of Wales 's Family , in what Manner did she behave ? Brett . I never heard but that she behaved very well . Council : Do you know that she was entrusted with Things of Value ? Brett . Yes , Sir ; there were all Sorts of Plate Candlesticks , Salves , and a great many Things were in her Power to take away : I was with her Mistress this Day and I asked her what she thought of her ; she gave her a very good Character ; she was very ill , or she would have been here herself . Mr Tibb . I belong to the Clerk of the Kitchen ; I know she was entrusted with Plate , and Things of Value ; her Mistress said she never had a better Servants and the only Reason that she was discharged , was , because she was married . Q. to Mrs. Cousins What is your Station ? Cousins . I am Servant to the Prince . I belong to the Nursery .

Mr. Bell . I have known the Prisoner for two Years , and she bears an honest Character . Q. to Mr. Matocks . Did you hear Tempest 's Nephew say this Woman cheapened any Candlesticks ? Matocks . When she was brought before the Justice , this Boy was examined ; he likewise promised Mr. Paulson to bring the Boy here upon his Word ; therefore the Justice did not bind him over . Tempest . The Reason I did not bring him , he is too young . Matocks . I 'll give the Reason why I believe he did not . The Boy was examined . Says the Justice , what have you to say about this Woman ; do you know any thing about her cheapening any Candlesticks ? The Boy said , as they were cheapening the Candlesticks , his Aunt said they were 3 s. Mr. Tempest put himself into such a Passion , that I thought he would have struck the Boy ; he said , You lye , Sirrah ; I never put such a price upon them . - Orton . The Justice asked if any Body else were in the Shop , the Boy was mentioned ; Justice Poulson said it was necessary to have the Boy brought ; when the Boy came , Mr. Paulson asked him how old he was , he said thirteen ; then he asked the Boy what he knew of the Affair of the Prisoner at the Bar ; he said , the Prisoner at the Bar and her Husband came in , and he bought a Coffee-pot , half a Dozen Knives and Forks , and Mr. Tempest went into the Back room ; and the Prisoner at the Bar ask what was the Price of a Pair of Candlesticks ; Mr. Tempest went backward , and the Boy and his Aunt was in the Shop , and the Prisoner at the Bar asked the Price of those Candlesticks , and his Aunt said they were 3 s. and Mr. Tempest repremanded the Boy for saying 3 s. when always the set Price was 3 s. 6 d. The Boy was in the Shop when the Woman went out ; when they were gone , the Boy said , Unkle , Did the Woman pay you for those Candlesticks ? he said no ; then he said they had got a Pair of Candlesticks not paid for ; upon that , Mr. Tempest went after her as far as Queen street ; when he came to her , she said she thought her Husband had paid for them . - Ashley . I was at the Justice 's along with the Prisoner ; I was afflicted with the Gout , so the Justice indulged me to sit down in a Chair , accordingly I did ; there was some Talk of this Kind , but I ca n't charge my Memory particularly with it , because I did not take particular Notice of it . Q . Was there any Talk about the Price of Candlesticks ? Ashley . What the former Witness has said of it , upon my Oath , I apprehend to be the Truth . The Prisoner was honourably acquitted . It appeared to the Court to be a very rash Piece of Conduct in Mr. Tempest ; and that Circumstance of his not bringing the Boy upon the Trial , according to his Promise , made his Cause appear doubtful . The Prisoner 's Husband petitioned for a Copy of her Indictment , but that was not granted . 155 , 156.
