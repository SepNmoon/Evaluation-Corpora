Wherein is related a True Account of all the Remarkable Proceedings : But more particularly , of Robert Dod , who killed the Taylor in Covent-garden , on the Ninth of June last . With the Names of those Condemned , Burnt in the Hand , to be Transported , and Whipp 'd . LONDON , July 12 . THIS day the Sessions began in the Old Baily , where several Persons were Tried for Felonies , Murder , and other Crimes ; whereof the most remarkable were these that follow . John Smith had an Indictment preferred against him , for stealing three Silver Tankards from Richard Green a Victualler in St. Dunstans West , on the twenty third past , which , upon his being apprehended , he confessed , and offered to make satisfaction ; whichbeing refused , he was committed to Newgate : so that being well tutor 'd there , he denied all he had formerly said : Yet it appearing plain , he was found Guilty ; as likewise of another Indictment , for stealing a Silver Full-pot from one Mr. Angel . Timothy Summerset was tried for stealing four Bushels of Meal from one Mr. Wilkinson near the Tower , with whom he lived in the nature of a Servant ; the which , upon reading his Indictment , he confessed . Thomas Wynne was tried for stealing a Tankard from Josias Webster of St. Andrews Undershaft , the nature of the Fact thus . The Prisoner coming into the Inn where the Prosecutor lived , called for Drink ; but whilst the Tapsters were busie , he went away with it : and afterwards being taken by Thief takers , he confessed where he had pawned it , and thereupon was found Guilty ; although upon his Trial he disowned all that he had formerly said . Thomas Pope was tried upon an Indictment preferred against him by one Thomas Orbe , for stealing Pewter Dishes ; and other things ; and being taken by the Watch , he was questioned by the Constable how he came by them ? whereto he replied , They were his own , and that he lived in the Cole yard in St. Giles 's , and that he was carrying them to the Sign of the Bell in Friday-street : But he being sent to New-Prison , the next day he sent to the Owner , and declared what he had done , promising Satisfaction : So that upon this Evidence given in Court he was found Guilty . Walter Jones being Arraigned , and put upon his Trial , for stealing several Parcels of Goods of great Value , pleaded Guilty to that , and all other Indictments under the Benefit of Clergy . Paul Perren was tried for robbing John Bates on the twelfth of June last , at the Bull Inn in Bishopsgate-street , of four Guinies , two Half-Guineas , and - s. in Silver , and his Shoulder knot ; which appeared thus : The person robbed coming drunk into the Inn , the person he pretended had robbed him took acquaintance with him , and after long drinking together , went to bed with him , contrary to his mind ; and that when he rose the next morning , he found himself robbed , and thereupon charged Perren with the Robbery , who as strongly denied it ; but upon search , the Shoulder-knot and a Knife was found in his Breeches , but none of the Gold nor Silver . Perren alledged on his Trial , That himself was likewise in Drink , and that the person who prosecuted him forced him to stay with him ; which in some measure appearing by a former Company the Prisoner was in , he was brought in Not Guilty . William Warraine came upon his Trial for the Murder of John Fletcher , a Youth ; the matter thus ; The Evidence declared upon Oath , That the party dead being abroad on May 29 last , was knock 'd down at the Bonfire within Ludgate , and there received so many Bruises , that he died thereof on the fourth of June following ; and that in the time he lay languishing , he accused the Prisoner , saying , He verily believed him to be the Person that struck him , naming his Name , and saying , If he might but see him , he doubted not but that he should know him : But the Party ( though desired ) refused to come . Yet there being but a bare Suspicion , he was cleared . John Robinson came upon his Trial , for breaking open the Chamber of Sir Thomas Little of the Temple , about the beginning of March last , and taking away a Cloak lined with Silk , a Silk Sute , an Embroider 'd Belt , Curtains , and some Linen , which he conveyed away by Water , hiring a Person to carry them for him , who , upon notice that such Goods were lost , gave notice to the Thief-taker , who soon described him ; and he being taken upon another Robbery , was charged with this Indictment ; but he stoutly denied the Robbery : yet it appearing he had such Goods , and not being capable to give any account how he came by them , he was convicted of the Felony . One Edling was tried for the death of Mr. Stanley , who died thro ' a Wound he received on his Finger about two years and three months since , in Westminster-Abby-yard , being there set upon by three persons , of whom it appeared upon Evidence that the Prisoner was one , another of them having been formerly tried and acquitted ; and therefore they laid it upon the third , who is fled into Scotland . Several Chyrurgeons give it upon their Oaths , That Mr. Stanley died of that Wound , by reason of its festering , which caused his Arm to be cut off . But the Prisoner ( although the Murder was strongly urged against him by Council ) protesting he was not there , and bringing some Evidence to confirm his Assertion , the Jury cleared him . John Scroby was tried for breaking open the Shop of William Thomson a Barber , on the twentieth of July , and taking thence six Perriwigs , and a Case of Silver tipp 'd Razors , Scissars , and the like , to the value of Eight pounds ; when going about to sell one of the Razors , he was apprehended , and another taken out of his Pocket ; yet he denied that he ever had any part of them , pretending that those Razors were given him a long time since ; but not any ways making it appear , he was convicted of the Robbery only . John Murrell came in and took his Trial , ( having been at large upon Bail ) for killing Robert Atkins , a Child , about six years old , near Lincolns-Inn-Fields , by running his Coach over him : But the Jury taking it into consideration , and it appearing not to be done out of any neglect , but by meer accident , he was found Not guilty . Robert Dod was tried for killing William Catling on the ninth day of June last , in Covent-garden . The Trial was very tedious ; a Cloud of Witnesses being called on either Side ; but the substance of the Evidence was ; That Robert Dod had been formerly very intimate with the Party murder 'd , and that the Party murder 'd , as he suspected , used too much Familiarity with his Wife , which so far enraged his Jealousie , that he often sent for Catling ; but it being intimated to him , that he had some Design against him , he most commonly refused , and order 'd his Servants , That if at any time Dod came , they should deny him . This having passed for the space of two Months , at last they hapned to meet in Covent-garden , where , in a Tavern , after they had drank several Bottles of Wine , much Discourse hapning , they began to talk about Manhood ; the person killed saying , He fear 'd no man with a Sword , so be it he had a Stick : and as for Dod 's Sword , he said , It was so simple a one , that he could put it by with his Hat . WhereuponDod taking it up , began to Fence against him with the Scabbard on , making Offers and Passes , till at last the Scabbard , as he pretended , fell off , though many were of opinion he pulled it off : He thrust his Sword into the Body of Catling eight or nine Inches , and likewise gave him another Wound , and then breaking his Sword , fled ; Catling dying before the Chyrurgeons could dress his Wound . But there being a Parson in Dod 's Company , and he charged for being aiding and abetting , he discover 'd where his Haunts were , so that the same Night he was taken . All that he endeavoured to prove , was , That there was no former Malice between them ; so that upon my Lord Chief Baron Mountague 's summing up the Evidence , the Jury gave in their Verdict , That he was guilty of Manslaughter . Mr. John Poultney took his Trial for killing Tho . Howard Esq ; on the eighth Instant , in St. James 's Square . The Witnesses for the King declared , That they met , and that Mr. Howard drew upon Mr. Poultney first , and after some Passes , Mr. Poultney having wounded the other , disarmed him , and that then they parted , Mr. Howard going to the Half-Moon Tavern ; where finding his Wound desperate , he sent for a Chyrurgeon , who told him he was a dead man , asking who had given him the Wound ? To which he answered , Mr. Poultney , and that he had done it fairly , the Cause being , because he had Posted him : So that having sent for a Minister to pray by him , he , after having forgiven Mr. Poultney , died . Mr. Poultney produced several Witnesses to attest , That the Party defunct had upon a Quarrel about his Marrying a Lady he pretended to , sent him many threatning Letters , as likewise followed him over into England ; and that upon notice he sought his Life , a Serjeant at Arms was ordered to secure them both , to whose Custody Mr. Poultney surrendred ; but the other absconded : and he declared , That he had not seen him till such time as he met him in St. James 's Fields , and that what he did there , was in defence of his own Life : So that , upon the whole Evidence , the Jury found it Se defendendo . Thomas Mountague was tried for breaking open the Cellar of John Burrough in Shoreditch , and taking away five Pots of Butter , two of which being found about him , he was found Guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] John Emms and Sarah Northern , the first as Principal , and the last as Accessarie , were Indicted upon three Felonies and Burglaries : First , for breaking open the House of Charles Tats ; second , for breaking open the House of Jonathan Person ; and thirdly , the House of Mary Tats .
