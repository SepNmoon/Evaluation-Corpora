The Proceedings at The Sessions-House IN The Old-Bayly , On the 24 of this instant November , In Relation to the Bill of Indictment , presented to the Grand-Jury of London , against the Earl of Shaftsbury for High-Treason . Giving an Account of all the most Material Passages . With the Names of the Evidence , their Examination by the Jury , and the Returning the Bill Ignoramus , & c. This day the Grand Jury for the City of London , being Summoned by Vertue of a special Commission , made their Appearance at the Sessions-House in the Old-Baily , where after they were Sworn , Sir S. Bernardiston being Foreman , a Bill of Indictment for High-Treason against Anthony Earl of Shaftsbury was Presented to them , the which , after my Lord Chief Justice had given the Charge , was Read , Importing , that the said Earl had Tratorously and Maliciously conspired the compassing the Death of his Majesty , him to Depose , and put to final Destruction , by raising Armes , and leavying War within his Majesties Dominions , & c . Upon which a Paper was produced , Importing several Designes against his Majesties Person and Government : As likewise a kind of an Oath or solemn Covenant to be taken by such as were to enter into the Confederacy for opposing the Succession , which Paper was Sworn to be found in the Earls Closet by Mr. Guinn , one of the Clerks of the Council , and sealed up in his Trunk on the 6th of July last , & c. Sir Lyonel Jenkins and Mr. Blackwaite gave Evidence , that it was the same Paper that they had before seen , which came out of the Earls Trunk ; then after the Jury had made Objections against the Witnesses being Examined in open Court , and had been over-ruled in that particular , Mr. John Booth was called and Sworn the rest not being permitted to come within hearing ; he gave in Evidence , that he having had access to the Earls presence , by the means of Captain Wilkinson , a little before the sitting of the Parliament at Oxford ; he told him , that having well considered the Elections , he found they would insist upon the Bill of Exclusion ; The Repealing the 35 of Elizabeth , and the bringing in a Bill for Uniting the Protestant Dissenters , which he knew the King would not consent to , and therefore it was resolved , to compel him to it , and for that purpose , most of the Members would come Armed , and that himself was to have Fifty Gentlemen , which he designed should be Commanded by Captain Wilkinson , and that Captain Wilkinson told him , if he would List himself under him , he must provide him with Horse and Armes , and that he would provide his Man with a Horse ; the which he declared was done : The other witnesses were John Smith , Edward Ivy , Edward Turbervil , Brian Haines , John Macknamarra , Dennis Macknamarra , Bernard Dennis , who Evidenc 'd that the Earl at several times imparted to them Treasonable designs , tending to the Desposing of his Majesty , and to reduce the Kingdome to a Common-wealth , after the manner of Holland ; and that for that purpose , several persons would Arm : the Rable being resolute on their side , and a great number of Gentry who would cut in pieces the Mercinary Guards , and then take from his Majesty such Lords as at that time he mentioned , saying they Evilly advised his Majesty ; and that unless such means were used , Popery would Enevitably be Introduced and that it now stood the People of England upon to stand for their Liberties : that his Majesty might be Deposed as King Richard the Second was , he having taken such like Measures , or to that effect . Farther , it was Sworn that his Lordship should say , that his Grace the Duke of Buckingham ( in the Right of his Mother ) ought to be Baron of Ross , and had as good a Title to the Crown , as the Descent of the Stuarts , or to that effect . Many other passages were Sworn to , too tedious here to Incert . When the Evidence had been Examined , the Jury withdrew for some time , to consider the particulars , when returning , they desired to Examine the Evidence one by one , which was granted by the Court , whereupon they were called in order , and Cross Examined to what they had Sworn , in which they little vary 'd . When they had been Examined for the space of two hours , the Jury desired to have the Statute Book , to peruse the Statutes of the 25 of Edward the third and that of the 13 of his present Majesty , which was granted , and then went out again to debate the matter upon the whole Evidence , but stay 'd not above the space of an hour and a half before they returned , and brought in the Bill Ignoramus , upon which a very great Shout was given , and upon the complaint of the Evidence that they were in danger of their Lives , the Court ordered the Sheriffs to send for a Guard to Conduct them safe to their Habitations , and so ended these remarkable proceedings .
