I found my Goods at Mrs . Bees , and carried Stanley before Mr. De Veil , and she gave Information against the Prisoner . Anne Bee . Mrs. Stanley lodged at my House , and she one Day brought a Bundle of Things , and left them at my House , unknown to me : However , I asked her where she had them ? and she said , What signifies it where I had them ? I said they should not be in my House , and they carried them to another , but brought them back again unknown to me . There were Nutmegs , Tea , Sugar , Cloves , Mace , Chocolate , Starch , Blue , Fig-blue , Powder-blue : The Bundle was as thick as a little Child : As for the Quantities , I can say nothing of them . Christian Stanley . The Prisoner gave me the Bundle of Things ; I took them , not thinking any Thing of their being stoln . I knew where she lived , but was so silly , that I asked her no Questions about them .

I went with Mr. Cromwell to New . Prison , on Christmas-Day , to see the Prisoner , and she fell down on her Knees before us , begg 'd for Mercy , and own 'd that while the Men were out of the Shop , and at Supper , she made use of those Opportunities to take the Goods .

They lay at a little Distance from the Door on the Counter ; I was engaged in Business with my Back to the Linnen , and the Man was advanced almost within the Door : I was busy , and not very watchful . I told the Prisoner there was nothing for him , but I was mistaken as it happen 'd . He went away ; about 4 or 5 Minutes afterwards , I mist it , but thought the Servants might have taken it away . Upon enquiry , I found it was gone , and imagined that this Man must take it . On the Monday following he came again , and I seized him with one of the Shirts on his Back , which he resign 'd , and then asked me to forgive him . The Prisoner own 'd his taking the Goods , and said by way of Excuse , that he wanted a Shirt , therefore he took them : That he was in Liquor and had forgot the Door , else he would not have came there again , and that he gave this Shirt back to the Prosecutor with a very good Will , and in a very good natur 'd Manner .

These two Prisoners brought them to my Shop to be valu 'd ; I was not at home , but my Wife seeing the Crest rubb 'd out , sent for me , and I stopped them . I ca n't say which of the two laid them down , but White pretended most Claim to them . Collard said nothing about them . I asked the Reason of the Marks being taken out ? and I think it was White that said there was only 3 Letters upon them , but I can not be positive . I said I would stop them , and I think it was White said , she would send the right Owner for them : The Prisoners were taken in Moor-lane . Defence of the Prisoners . White . I was just come from Market , when I heard Collard 's Husband wanted to speak with me . I went to him , and he told me he had a Friend 's Spoons and Forks to borrow Money upon ; I asked him what he came to me for , I did not know what to do with them ; I wo n't pretend to borrow any thing upon them , till I know the Value of them . Nan , says he to his Wife , go along with her , and see what they are worth : She was not willing to go , but he threatned to kick her if she did not ; so we went to this Gentlemans in Barbican , and desired to have them valued , because there was Money to be lent upon them : He was not at home , but his Wife was . Very well Dame says she , taking up the Things , and carrying them into the Kitchen backwards . Madam , says Nan , wo n't you please to weigh 'em ? She told us , she wanted a two Ounce Weight , and we must stay 'till her Husband came , for she had sent for him : When he came , they went into the Kitchen and talked together ; and when they came out , she told me they must stop the Things , and bid us go home and fetch the Man we had them of . We went home , I to my Goods , and she to her Family , and we heard no more 'till the Constable came to take us up . We neither of us fled , when the Constable came . The Prisoner White call 'd several Witnesses in her Behalf , who gave her the Character of an honest and industrious Woman . Collard 's Defence was to the same Effect ; she said her Husband had brought these Things home with him , and when she was taken into Custody , he sold and pawn 'd all they had in the World , and has never since been heard of . Geo Rainbow , Mary Avery , Mary Panton , and others , gave Collard the general Character of an honest Woman . Acquitted . 6 , 7.

The Iron Crows I can swear to , the Lines I can not , tho ' I believe I might swear to them .

I was concerned in this Robbery , Dun , Beshaw and I , went from a Brandy-shop in Winford street that Night : Says Dun , let us go round Ratcliff-high-way ; the back Yards there are good Places to get wet Linnen from : We went round Ratcliff-high-way , cross 'd Sun-tavern-fields , and came to Mr. Baker 's Shed .

Beshaw . Did not you call me from the Brandy-shop ? Charnock , We went out together , as we have done many a Time , to get what we could meet with . Mr. Baker , jun . The Crow I swear to ; the unfinished Lines , I can not swear to ; but we have two Men here who made them , and who will swear they are my Property . The Prisoners and Charnock were suspected , and we took them before Justice Philips . Charnock begg 'd to be made an Evidence ( he had worked with me some years ago ) the two Prisoners owned the Fact before the Justice . William Knowlon . When we came to work on Christmas-Eve in the Morning , we found our Work gone , and the Shed robb 'd : We made Holiday , and I and my two Mates went up and down to make some Discovery ; we found some of the Hemp at the Bottom of Shakesby 's Walks , which we put into the Ware-house again , and got a Search Warrant , to search where we suspected , but we found nothing ; but going to drink a Dram with a Friend we met , we told him our Master had been robb 'd ; he told us he had seen such Things as we had lost at Bigg 's ; we went there , and found them upon a Cask-Head ; there were several Skains of House-Lines in Bigg 's Shop in Whitechapel : Whereof after we had found them , we desired Biggs to stop the Man that brought them if he should come again , but he said he would not ; but going up Brick-Lane we met Charnock . Whom we believed to be concerned , and we agreed to have a Penn'orth of Gin together , whereof we turned up to Bigg 's again , and there we desired Biggs to stop the Man that brought those Lines ; he said he had no Business with it , the Man that brought them should have them . I left one of my Mates there , while I stept down to Justice Philips ; and while I was there , word was brought down that the Man that brought the Lines was in Bigg 's Shop ; he ( Charnock ) was brought down , and there he told us , the Bolts we should find at Webb 's , a Smith 's , against Spittle-fields Church , and that some of the Lines were at his Mother 's ; we went , but the Hole in the Yard was dug up , and the Lines were gone ; whereof we searching farther found a Ball of Line buried at their Vault-door , and the Line was my Master 's ; we found Part of the Hemp in the Cellar , and the best had been spun up .

I told him , I was a poor labouring Fellow , and had none . I had two Silver Buckles in my Pocket , and thought to have dropped them ; but he laid hold of them , and took 8 d. from me in Money . Then he bid me get up , and I saw two of them ; they pulled off my Cloth Coat , with a Boot sleeve , and my Waistcoat : the other Man said to the Prisoner , let us leave him his Waistcoat ; but he cried , D - n me , I should not have it , and made me pull off my Breeches . then he bid me pull off my Shirt . I told him it was good for nothing ; but they insisted on having it , and my Shoes too , or they would shoot me thro ' the Head . I begged they would not leave me naked , and they gave me a Knock or two over the Shoulders , and said , If I offered to run after them , they would turn again , and shoot me thro ' the Head ; so I went back to my Mother 's . I can swear to the Prisoner , for I have known him from a Child , and went to School with him . I knew him as soon as he had knocked me down , and should have known him before . had not his Hat been flapped over his Face , which I did not see till he knocked me down .

December 12 . Catherine Callan . I live in Mr. Prime 's House in Grafton street . Half an Hour before this thing happened , I took out of my Trunk , a Purse with 50 Guineas . I wanted to change one of them ; the rest I tyed up and layed down upon an Oak Table in my forward Room : I was making a Shirt , and I covered the Purse with a Corner of the Linnen . I was going to the Washer-womans for some Cloaths , so I bid my Brother , who was in the back Room , and expected he should be arrested , to lock the Door after me : I stood on the Stair-head , till he had locked the Door , and then went down Stairs . When I came back , this Man ( the Prisoner ) and two or three more , with a Woman , was at the top of the Stairs . What do you do there , says I ? What 's that to you , said he , and set his Shoulder to the Door - away flew the Lock into the middle of the Room . I seeing the Door fly open , was so astonished - I was frighted out of my Wits - he layed his Hands on my Brothers , and shoving over to where the Table stood , he spy 'd the Purse , and being nearer the Table than I , he snatched it up . Well says I , if you come to arrest the Man , do not rob me . Q . But how came he to see the Purse ; you said it was covered . Callan . He had shoved the Linnen off , and then he saw it ; and when he had taken it , the rest of the Fellows gathered close about him . I cryed out , I was robbed ! - I was robbed ! You Bitch , says he , say a Word , and I 'll cut your Throat , and out he pulled a long Knife - Woman ! Woman ! says my Brother , hold your Tongue , or we shall all be murdered ! I dropped back on a Chair , and had not power to speak a Word more - My Money lost , my Life in danger - Then away he hurried down Stairs , and they with him , and took my Brother with them . In 5 or 6 Minutes I came to my self , ran down Stairs , and said to the Folks below , I am robbed , which way are the Fellows gone ? They directed me , and away I came to the Prisoner 's House . He had locked up my Brother , and I saw no body but him in the Parlour - Give me my Money , says I . Tell me of any such thing and I will kill you , says he - but be easy , and I will make up Matters with you . I found I could not get my Money , so away I came to get a Warrant for him immediately , thinking to take my Purse upon him ; but all the Justices were at Hicks 's Hall ; so I could not get a Warrant 'till Night , and then he was not to be found ; he is a Prisoner in the Fleet , though he has a House of his own . On Saturday last he was taken ; the Fact was committed on December 12 . Kirk . Ask her whether I did not stay 'till she had taken a Shirt out of her Lap ; and 'till he had put it on ? C. Callan . He put a Shirt on , to be sure - Q . Was the Shirt he put on , part of the Linnen in your Apron , or of that which lay on the Table ? C. Callan . The Shirt he put on was in the Room before ; there were Shirts in the Trunk , whether it was one of them in the Apron , or one taken out of the Trunk , I can not well tell . Kirk . Ask her if she did not give him one , and he refused it , because it had not a ruffled Bosom ? C. Callan . I can not tell ; I do n't know whether I gave him a Shirt or not Kirk . Ask her , if her Brother did not ask her for 5 s. before I brought him out of the House ? C. Callan . Yes , but it was before I fainted away ; and I told him that you had got all my Money : I had but 2s . out of the Guinea I had changed : Kirk . Ask her if she did not say , she had 3s . and that she had pawned a Shirt for that ? C. Callan . I said no such thing . Kirk . Ask her whether her Brother 's Sister was not at my House , when she came there ? C. Callan . I did not see her . Patrick Callan . On the Sunday before this happened , I told 50 Guineas , and put them in a Green Silk Purse , and left them with my Wife . I went to the Prince of Wales 's at Ken-Green to work , and was away all the Week , and came home the Saturday following . I went up Stairs , and found a Padlock on the Door - What is the Fancy , said I to my Landlady , that my Door is padlock 'd ? Your Door , said she was broke open yesterday , and you have been robbed by Bailiffs that came after the young Fellow that lodges with you . Your Wife cried out , she was robbed , and is gone after the Men ; she had a Warrant for them yesterday , and she did not lye in the Room last Night . I went to Long-Acre , found my Wife , and she told me what had happened . Kirk . What Business are you ? P. Callan . I am a Slater ; well known in Town and Country . I have been a Master , am now a Journeyman , and have 12 s. a Week now , according as the Season is favourable , I can earn more . Kirk . Ask , whether he can work in wet Weather ? P. Callan . Yes , wet and dry ; in Slate , Wet does no great hurt . Kirk . Ask , whether he has saved that Money since he came from Ireland ? P. Callan . No ; I have been not 2 Years in England ; I can safely say I brought 40 Guineas from Dublin , where I kept a Publick-house . Edw Obryan . December 12 , about 10 o'clock in the Morning , I was very unwell , and was in Bed , and my Sister came and told me she was going to the Washer-woman 's , and had taken out a Guinea to change . I being afraid of Bailiffs , got up and locked the Door : I was aware of this Gentleman to arrest me , tho ' he is a Prisoner in the Fleet . A Woman came first to the Door , and I let her in ; it was the Plaintiff 's Sister : I hope , says I , you do n't come to set me ? No , not I , said she , but presently 2 or 3 Men came to the Door , and , upon my refusing to open the Door , Kirk and all his Men burst open the Door , and the Lock flew off . Kirk entered first , and laying hold of me , the Linnen on the Table was whipped off , and Kirk put the green Silk Purse that lay there into his Coat Pocket . - I saw him do it , as plain as I see your Worship this Moment . My Sister pushed in with them , and seeing him take the Purse , she cry 'd out , - I am robbed , and catched hold of the Skirt of his Coat . Q . Had he arrested you before he took the Purse ? Obryan . He laid his Hand on me first ; and said to her , You Whore , if you say a Word , I 'll cut your Throat , and drew out a long Knife . Hold your Tongue , says I , or we shall be murdered . There were three or four with him , and they had great Clubs as thick as my Leg . Then they dragged me to Kirk 's House , by the Seven-Dials , and my Sister followed . Upon this , Kirk comes to me , and desired me to make my Sister easy , - if I did , he told me I should be discharged . You have robbed her , said I , and if I ca n't pay the Debt , I must go to Gaol , Moreover , my Lord , my Sister went for a Warrant , and he run out of the Way for a Month , and was not to be taken at any seasonable Time . Kirk . I would ask him , whether I did not stay till she had given him a Shirt ; and till he put it on ? Obryan . Yes . Kirk . I would ask whether he did refuse one Shirt , because it had not a Ruffled Bosom ? Obryan . They were both ruffled ; one was broke in the Wristbands . I put on the best . Kirk . Ask him , whether he made any Outcry either in the Room , or in the Street ? Obryan . No ; there were 6 or 7 Fellows with you . Kirk . Did not the Plaintiff 's Wife 's Sister come in with me ? Obryan . No ; she was in the Room before . Kirk . What Business do you follow ? Obryan . I am a Glover , and sell my Work to Country Chapmen . Jane Prime . I know nothing of the Matter ; I was not at home when the Man was arrested ; Callan came down presently ( afterward ) and said she was robbed . Kirk . I would ask her , when she heard of Callan 's being robbed ? Prime . Pray , my Lord , discharge me . - I heard a little matter of a Noise before . - It was no Business of mine . - Pray , my Lord , let me go . Kirk . Ask her , what Character they bear ? Prime . If you please , my Lord , to let me go - They had not been long with me : I ca n't say much to that . Kirk . I would ask her - Prime . Do n't force your Discourse to me . Pray , my Lord , let me go . Kirk . Ask , whether she has not been forced to call in the Watch to quiet them ? Prime . Once I did . What 's that to the purpose ? Pray , my Lord , discharge me . Prisoner 's Defence . On Thursday Night , the Plaintift 's Wife Ann Casey came to me to get Obryan arrested . I went that Night to the Play-houses to look for him , for there he goes to pick Pockets ; I did not find him that Night . In the Morning , Bridget Casey came and agreed to set him : She was to go to his Lodging , if she stayed a Quarter of an Hour , I was to go in : she stayed half an hour , so I went up and one Man with me ; he knocked at the Door , but would not open it ; and immediately he says to the Woman , that was with him , You . B - h , you have set me . I will kill you , I went down Stairs and told Ann Casey , that I heard his Voice in the Room , so she came up with me and one Mrs Mitchell ; Ann Casey knocked at the Door , and bid her Sister Bridget open the Door . Obryan fell upon the Woman within , and made her cry out , Murder ; the Plaintiff 's Wife then opened the Door , and I went in and arrested him . He begged I would stay ; his Sister , he said , was gone for a Shirt , and I stayed a Quarter of an Hour before Mrs Callan came in . When she came in , he told her he was arrested ; then you must go to Goal , said she . Hold your Tongue , you B - h , says he , and gave her 3 or 4 Kicks . - He said he had been robbed in Fleet street last Night , when he was drunk ; had fell in the Kennel , and must have a clean Shirt : she gave him one , and he did not like it ; so she gave him another . My Lord , I will prove my Writ against Edward Obryan , at the Suit of Thomas Casey . Mr. Rose . The Prisoner is now a regular Officer in the Marshal 's Court . Ann Casey . I went to my Sister Bridget Casey , and told her I wanted to arrest Obryan . She gave me Instructions where to find him , and went with me to Kirk 's House ; we came all together to an Alehouse just by , and sent my Sister to see for Obryan . If she stayed a Quarter of an Hour we were to come ; if he was not at Home , she was to return to us . We stayed the drinking of 2 Pots of Beer and eat Bread and Cheese , and concluded he was at Home ; we went Kirk went before , and I staid in the Street ; but he came down presently and told me , he was abusing my Sister for setting him . Upon this , I went up Stairs , and hearing the Outcry within , I put my Hand to the Door and opened it : then Kirk entered and arrested him ; and he begged he would stay till his Sister came with a clean Shirt , and to make us pity his Moan , he told us he had been robbed , & c. - and had not a Shilling in the World It was more than a Quarter of an Hour before his sister Callan came in ; there was not a Word of the Purse mentioned till next Day . He asked her for Money : she said she had but 2 s. and told him , she had pawned a Shirt for 3 s. out of which she had paid 1 s. for washing the Linnen in her Apron , and she gave him the 2 s. that were left . Callan was at Kirk 's House as soon as we , and made a Noise at him for arresting her Brother ; but Obryan called her backward , and said , Do n't speak a Word , you Whore , - but swear what I bid you . Margaret Mitchell swore she was present ; her Evidence was to the same effect ; and she was positive that no Knife was produced , nor did she see any Clubs , or any other Weapons . Henry Smith , John Devine , ( who were the Prisoner 's Assistants ) and Bridget Casey , confirmed the Evidence of Ann Casey and Margaret Mitchell . Sarah Connolly gave an Account of a Quarrel that Patrick Callan and his Wife had about 5 or 6 Weeks ago with another Person , which was made up at a Publick-house ; and neither of them having any Money to pay the Reckoning , Mrs. Callan pawned her Ring to this Witness for 5 s. and has never since been able to redeem it . Edward Cotterel , a Constable , swore the same . Q . What Character has Obryan ? Wm James . I have seen him in Company with Moll Fitzgerald , a Thief , and have likewise seen him iron 'd in Newgate . Geo Fidoe . Callan told me , that Kirk had robbed her ; but she gave me a very different Account of it from what she has done here . Edward Sharp .
