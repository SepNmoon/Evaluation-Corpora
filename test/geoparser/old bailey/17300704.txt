Mr .

This Evidence was confirm 'd by the Prosecutor 's Wife , Anne Cushnee , who depos 'd , That the Prisoner having desired her to lay up in his Pocket Book three Guineas and a half , he having no Conveniency to lay it in , and not caring to carry it about him , that she did so , and the next Week he desir 'd to have half a Guinea of it , and about ten Days after that he desir 'd to have another Guinea , which she gave him , and soon after ask 'd for his Pocket Book , and the other two Guineas , which was given him , as her Husband had before depos 'd . That on Sunday , the 21st of June , the Prisoner came into her Room , and sate there Reading , that she telling him , it was time to go to Church , that the Bells had rung in , he went , but came back again in less than half an Hour ; that she asking him , why he came back so soon ? He said , the Prayers were ended , and he was weary of standing ; that she not knowing how to get him out of the Room , and wanting to shift herself , was oblig 'd to go down into a Neighbour 's Room to do it ; that while she was out of the Room , the Key of that Drawer in which the Money was , hung with other Keys in the upper Part of the Trunk , the Prisoner sitting by the Trunk reading , that she suspecting nothing , never look 'd for her Money till the Wednesday following ; that then she being washing , the Prisoner desir 'd to have his Linen wash 'd , saying , he was to go into the Country ; she knew not by what foreboding of Mind , ran up in some surprize to look for her Money , and having taken the Keys out of her Trunk some Days before , and thrown them among some Clothes into a Basket , open 'd the Drawer , and found that all her Money was gone ; upon which knowing that no Body had been alone in her Room but the Prisoner , she complained before the Prisoner of her Money being lost ; and she observing that the Prisoner took little Notice of it , there being no other Person for her to suspect but the Prisoner , she charg 'd him with it ; but he deny 'd it , she got an Officer , and would have him consent to be search 'd , but he said he would not be search 'd but before higher Powers ; whereupon he was carried before the Justice , and being search 'd , in his Pocket Book were found twenty Guineas and a half ; that before she saw the Money , there were among her Guineas two that she had taken particular Notice of , and if at any time she took out Money , she always took Care to look over them , and lay them by , resolving not to part with them while she had any other left ; that they both of them had a Pig ( as she call 'd it , i. e. an Elephant ) under the Head , one of them was a very fair new Guinea , and the other an old one , that had been a little defac 'd or worn ; that upon looking over the Money , there were two such Guineas there , which she swore positively to be two of those she had lost ; and the same she swore in Court , they being produc 'd and shewn to her . Justice Webster depos 'd , That she did before him describe one , or both , of the Guineas before ever she saw them . The Prisoner began his Defence with a florid Harangue , That it was some Alleviation to the Greatness of his Misfortune , that tho ' he was a Stranger in the Country , distant from his Friends , he had the Happiness to stand and vindicate his Innocence before so honourable a Court , the Fame of whose Justice and Impartiality he had so often heard . That as to the Fact he was charg 'd with , he was intirely Innocent ; that he descended of a reputable Family , had the Happiness of having had a Gentleman-like , learned , and virtuous Education ; had commence Master of Arts in the University of A ; was capable of taking his Trial in Latin or Greek ; was always train 'd and educated in Christian Principles , and his Mind embellish 'd with such noble Notions of Vertue , that it was not probable , may , possible , he could be Guilty of so base a Fact as he stood charg 'd with ; that he had serv 'd several Years in the Excise in Scotland , had good Recommendations thence to London ; that he had indeed married unhappily , and for that Reason came to London in Expectation of some Advancement ; and that he brought Money with him from Scotland , and could prove he had more Money than the three Guineas and a half , but being a Stranger , kept it conceal 'd , being sew 'd up in his Fob .

The Prisoner intimated , that the Prosecutor was but a Journeyman Taylor , and his Wife a Washerwoman , and that it was unlikely that he should have so much as eighteen Guineas and a half , and call 'd some Witnesses who had heard the Prosecutor 's Wife complain for want of Money . To this the Prosecutor and his Wife reply 'd , That upon Occasion of some Words between him and his Wife , the Prisoner took upon him to say , what need have you to complain , you have Gold enough . But the Prosecutor call 'd others who establish 'd his Character as to that ; and that he and his Wife were honest , saving , and industrious People , and did generally pass in the Neighbourhood for Persons aforehand in the World .
