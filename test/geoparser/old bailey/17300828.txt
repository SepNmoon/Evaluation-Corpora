John Clough depos 'd , That there were frequent Disorders in the Prosecutor 's House , and crying out Murther several times in a Day , and the like at Nights .

Jacob Willis depos 'd , That he was along with Mr . Body , the Constable , to serve a Warrant upon Mrs. Eaton ; that they having taken her , the Prosecutor came attended with a Mob with Staves , and a Fork in her Hand to rescue her Sister , swearing violently she would kill us all , and had like to have stabbed him , this Evidence ; and that Michael Willis was beat and bruis 'd very much , that the Prosecutor got hold of Michael Willis 's Cane , and he holding it , and she pulling with Violence , pull 'd it out of his Hand , and so fell into the Channel , and he lost his Cane , and that they lost one of their Prisoners ; and that John Willis was not there , and they were in Danger of losing their Lives . Thomas Fielding depos 'd , That he was assisting Mr . Body , the Constable , in apprehending Mrs. Eaton and Mary Sullivan , and that the Prosecutor came with four or five Men with Sticks , swearing and cursing violently , and using many wicked Expressions , saying , she would stab us all , and laid hold of Michael Willis , and she shrunk her self down under his Arm to skreen her self from the Blows while the Men were laying on with their Sticks upon Michael Willis with great Violence ; that Sullivan got away in the Fray , but he secur 'd Mrs. Eaton , that she said to him , let me go , you may depend upon it there will be Murder presently ; that Mrs. Philips was down in the Channel , but he did not see Willis strike her , and that he believes he was ten Yards off her at the time she was down ; that they afterwards carried Eaton to the Round-House . This Evidence swore , that John Willis was not there ; it was added , it was her common Practice to cry out she was Robbed , in order to raise a Mob to rescue her when she was apprehended . James Watkins depos 'd , That he had been several times at the Prosecutor 's House , and had taken out several disorderly Persons ; and that once she lock 'd him , and his Assistance in , and took a Case-knife , and swore violently , that she would Murther the Willis 's if she could . Robert Walker depos 'd , That the Friday after the Indictment against the Prisoners was found , he was sent for by the Prosecutor to the Bishop's-Head in the Old-Bailey , to print an Advertisement , and there he heard her say , she would absolutely swear the Prisoners Lives away , and said , tho ' she was not robb 'd , she would hang them . Samuel Stephens being call 'd by the Prosesecutor to contradict the Evidence of Walker , depos 'd , That he was at the Bishop's-Head at that time , and he heard no such Words spoken ; but being ask 'd , if he was there all the time that Walker was there ? He reply 'd , No , adding , that he must say thus far for the Willis 's , that he had been often with them , and had known when they had had large Sums of Money offered when they had apprehended ill People , and they never would take it , and he did believe Michael Willis did never take a Farthing in his Life . There were other Evidences to the like Purpose .
