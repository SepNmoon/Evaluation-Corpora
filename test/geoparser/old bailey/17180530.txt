The Prisoner pleaded in his Defence , that he did not take the said Goods with a Felonious Intent , to wrong his Master of them , but being in Debt was very much pressed by his Creditors , and the Expectation he had from his Friends depending upon his being in Business , and having Money to come up from some of them , which was delayed some Month ; longer than he expected , did make bold to pawn his Master 's Goods , with Intent when he received his Money to have redeemed them again , and have carried them again to his Master 's Shop . He did indeed call several Persons he had formerly served , who gave him a very good Character ; and some that did confirm what he said of Money that he was to receive out of the Country , which was delayed , and did at last come , but just before his Apprehension ; so that his Allegations did appear probable . But these Excuses not being allowable in such Cases , the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . Death . Thomas Devereux , of St. Clements Danes , was indicted for feloniously stealing a Gown , Petticoat , and Linnen , value 35 s. the Property of Hannah Benson , the 26th of April last .

The Prisoner pretended he found them in the Street , and that he did belong to the Essex Man of War , and went along with them a Pressing , but staying behind , as he was going after them was charged with the Fact , but he knew nothing of the Matter , being very drunk . In answer to this the Constable deposed , when he was first apprehended he appear 'd very sober ; but when he was carrying before the Justice he seem 'd to be so very drunk that he could scarce hold him up ; but when he came from thence to go to Newgate , he was so sober that he could scarce keep him from running away from him .

The Pocket was not found upon him ; the Coachman who apprehended the Prisoner was not there , and the Prosecutor was cautious of swearing positively he was the Person that took her Pocket , it being dark ; but said , by his person she did verily believe him to be the same . The Prisoner pleaded that he had been drinking , and was going along , and hearing a Cry of Stop Thief , ran to see what was the Matter , and so was apprehended by the Coachman . This pretence and the Gentlewoman 's Cautiousness availed him so that the Jury acquitted him . Robert Ferryman , of the Parish of St .

The Servant deposed the same , adding that he going down into the Cellar to draw some Sider , met the Prisoner on the Stairs different from what he went down , and asking him what he did there , he pretended he had mistaken his way ; but when he came into the Cellar saw the Cock taken out of the But of Stout , and another out of the Cask of Sider , and the Liquors running about the Cellar ; however the Prisoner got off for that time , but was afterwards taken by accident . The Prisoner denied the Fact , or that he ever was in the Prosecutor 's House in his Life . But the contrary being sufficiently proved , the Jury found him guilty to the value of 10 d.

One Evidence deposed that the Prisoner came to live at Enfield not long before , having taken a Cottage of 45 s. per Annum , and having no Land to it , was observed to have Cattle which were fed upon Enfield-Chase ; and that Ann Pigot lost a Cow , which the Prisoner used to drive from the Chase and own to be his . General Pepper 's Servant deposed , that hearing the Prisoner was suspected , and knowing that the General had lost two Cows , which were among his Cattle when he came to him about 6 Months ago , and had been since lost , he went to see the Prisoners Cattle , and found the two Cows , but the Marks seemed to be cut or filed out of their Horns ; but he knew the Beasts to be General Pepper 's . The Prisoner in his defence said that the Cows were all his own , and that he had had them ever since Bartholo-tide last ; that he had bought them at the Welsh-Fair at Clerkenwell at that time ; he brought an Evidence to prove he bought two such Beasts at that time , which very near or altogether answered the Description : He produced several Persons who gave him a very good Character , that he was a very honest and industrious Man , that he used to keep Cows , succle Calves , sell Milk , & c. for a Living : That he had before he removed to Enfield lived very honestly at Kentish-Town , but meeting with Misfortunes , was obliged to leave that Place , and go by the Name of Doulton : but that he always behav 'd himself very honestly and industriously .

The Prisoner pleaded in his Defence that he was Keeper of the Lodge-House in Enfield-Chase belonging to General Pepper and finding a stray Horse upon the Chase he enquir 'd for the owner but could hear of none , although he had rid him from Town to Town , and Fair to Fair , and being inform 'd by the Country People that he might ( as he understood them ) sell the House in a Twelve Month and a Day the buyer and he meeting together , and being both in drink struck the Bargin ; but he had no Intent at all to steal the Horse , but mistaking the matter of keeping him a Twelve Month and a Day and then selling him , he understood he might sell him at any time within a Twelve Month and a Days . Some Persons from General Pepper gave the Prisoner the Character of a very Honest Man , who having behav 'd himself for 16 Years very well in the Army , and being grown in Years had been put into that Employment by the General , so that it was rather the Effects of Ignorance and Liquor than a Felonious intent . The Jury thereupon acquitted him .

That thereupon they apprehended Rebeccah White the Mother , and John White the Son , who at first was obstinate , but after some time confest the Fact , and his Accomplices , who were the prisoners above mentioned , and they were apprehended . John White deposed , that himself and the three other Boys were drinking together at an Alehouse in Smith-field in the afternoon , and staid there while Twelve a Clock at Night ; that then they all went to the prosecutors House , where John Pierpoint lifted him up , and he took down the Glass , and gave it to the rest , who hid it ; that then he went in and opened the Shop Door , and they all came in , and took each of them a parcel of the things , and he went Home , but they not with him , but each of them had their parcel , which they threw down , and he went and fetched them , and then went to get a Candle , designing in about an Hour to have gone to meet them in order to have shared the Goods among them .

WHereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex , in this Kingdom , have contracted an Evil Habit of Body , wherein the vicious Humours , at first dispers 'd thro ' the Whole , come at length to be lodged in one Part or another , and many times , for Causes too long to be here mentioned , are thrown down upon the Womb , occasioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part , which being neglected , at last turns Cancerous , and often proves Fatal . This is to acquaint all such as may have occasion , that speedy Relief is to be had from a Sworn and experienc 'd Midwife , dwelling at the Sign of the Queen 's Arm next Door to the Tin-Shop near Exeter Change in the Strand , who perform 'd a wonderful Cure upon a Lay at the Bark , after she was given over by the Physicians , and since has Cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and Suburbs of London .
