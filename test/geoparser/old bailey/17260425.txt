William Milton thus depos 'd . The Prisoner was my Servant . I left 22 l. in a Drawer in my Parlour , and on Sunday before Easter , I mist 7 l. but did not speak of it to any body , in hopes , that by keeping it secret , I might the sooner discover the Thief . On the Sunday following . I took particular Notice of how much Money was then left , and lock 'd it in my Drawer , and lock 'd my Parlour Door , and leaving none but the Prisoner at home , I went to Church . When I came back I mist 3 Guineas more , upon which I examin 'd her about it , and she at last confest , that Richard Roberts , who she said lodged at the Bull-Head in the Mint , had for sometime past pretended Love to her , that he came to see her in Sermon Time , both the Sunday before , and the Sunday present ; that he brought several Picklock-Keys , with which she open 'd the Parlour Doors and the Drawers ; and that at the first Time , she gave him out of the Purse 4 Guineas , 10 Half-Crowns , and 1 s.

And one Day she was sent up Stairs for a pair of Stockings , and ( as she afterwards confest ) she open 'd the Drawer , and took out the Goods . - Now , it so fell out that in a Day or two after , we had a Loin of Veal for Dinner , and my Wife sent the Maid up for a Silver Spoon , but down she came again , and said there was none there , and then my Wife ran up , and mist the Ring ; upon which we got a Warrant to search the Prisoner 's Lodging , and we found the Thousand of Pins in her Bed , and the 2 Spoons , and some of the Linnen , and a Key , that upon Tryal would open all our Drawers . - She confest that she had sold two of the Rings to Mrs. Ridley , a Goldsmith , near King Edward 's Stairs , in Wapping ; we went thither , but Mrs. Ridley said , we should not search her House , no , not if we had my Lord Chancellor 's Warrant .

Between 10 and 11 in the Morning , I went out of my Shop into my Kitchen , to get a little Drink . I was gone but a few Minutes , and at my coming into the Shop again , I mist my Show-Glass in the Shop Window . I was very much surpriz 'd to think how it could be carried off undiscover 'd at that time of Day , and in such an open publick Place . I made Enquirys , but could get no Intelligence , till the next Night about 12 o'Clock , and then a Man came to me from the Mint , and told me that the Thief was taken , and several of the Goods found upon him . I went thither , and saw the Prisoner , and he confest to me that he had had the Goods , but said that he found them in Moorfields . Abraham Smith thus depos 'd . I happen 'd to be a little in sor't , for I had been a drinking along with some of my Customers , and so I laid down upon the Bed to take a Nap , and about the Dusk of the Evening , just as I was going to get up , somebody knocks at the Door , - Who 's there ? says I , - Why its I , says the Prisoner , - What d 'ye went , says I , - Can ye tell me , says he , what is become of Hannah . No , not I , what would you have with her . Why , says he , I gave her a great Parcel of Rings to pawn for me , and she is run away with them . - You must know that this Hannah was one of his Flows . - And besides I heard that he had been all Day at Bess Dammeree 's , and spent a matter of 8 l. - I went to Mrs. Clare , at whose House he lodged , and told her of it , and at Night we went with a Constable , and searched , and found some of the Goods in his Bed Room , and some upon him at Mother Dammeree 's . Brown the Constable thus depos 'd . Last Wednesday late at Night , Mr. Clare ( who lives at the Crooked-Billet and Sugar-Loaf in the Mint ) told me that the Prisoner who pretended to be a Kinsman of his , was at Mother Dammeree 's , and had got a great Parcel of Gold Rings , and Silver Snuff-Boxes , and desir 'd me to assist him , and others to take him , - When we came there , we found him sitting upon a Bed Side , with nothing but a pair of Ticken Breeches on . I carry 'd him to my own House , and found these 2 Rings in his Pocket , which are own 'd by the Prosecutor . - Bishop another Constable thus depos 'd . - I sent Word to Mr. Lovell , that the Prisoner was taken in the Mint , - He came , and we search 'd the Prisoner , and I found these 3 Rings upon him . Eleanor Clare thus depos 'd . The Prisoner was our Lodger , and pretended to be our Kinsman , for being lately come , over from Ireland , he told us that he had married my Husband 's Brother 's Daughter , and that he was a Hatter by Trade . - About Noon on the Day of the Robbery , he came in , and gave my Child , a Necklace , and told me that he was going again for Ireland . - From our House he went to Mother Dammeree 's , who kept a Bawdy House at the Next Door , and there I suppose he spent the rest of the Day and Night , for next Day in the Evening Mr. Smith came , and told us of his having spent 8 l. there , and that he had got a great many Rings and Snuff-Boxes . Upon this I had a Suspicion of my new Kinsman , for on the Saturday before , he had not Money to pay for his Weeks Lodging . So we went up into his Room to search , and there was his Wastcoat and Breeches hid behind a Picture . We pull 'd them out , and found the Pockets loaded with Rings , and Chains , and Snuff-Boxes , which were afterwards shewn to the Prosecutor , and he swore them to be his . - Whereupon we took the Prisoner . Michael Clare thus depos 'd , when I heard my Kinsman had got so many fine Things , and that he had spent 8 l. in a Day and a Night 's Time , Why then he never came honestly by these Things , nor she Mony , says I , for he had but ten Pence the Night before last , but however , lets go see if he has left any of his Riches in my Room where he lodges . So up we went , and behind an old Picture of King Charles , there was hid his Wastcoat and Breeches , in which we found a great many Snuff boxes , and other Things , in Gold and Silver . After this we went to Bess Dammeree 's , and I knockt at the Door , and ask 'd if my Kinsman was there . She said there was a Man above , but she did not know whether he was my Kinsman or not . As we were going up Stairs , we heard a sort of a Hustling in the Room , which made me suppose that he , and one of his Mauxes were a Bed together , but when we came in , he had slipt on his Breeches , and was sitting upon the Bed Side , and in those Breeches we found more of Mr. Lovell 's Goods . Richard Johns thus depos 'd . Between Ten and Eleven in the Morning , I was walking round Holywel-Mount ( in the Field near Holywel-Lane , Shoreditch ) and at some Distance , I saw a Man standing in an odd Posture , with his Back towards me , and his Head almost between his Legs . I could not imagine what he was about , and so I went towards him , upon which he laid himself all along upon something , as if he had been asleep ; at that Time a Friend of mine coming by , we walk 'd off a little Way , and stood upon the Watch . We saw the Man rise again , and perceived something like a Box under him ; but seeing us , he lay down again . We went up to him , and asked him why he lay in that Manner : He said , he was not well . We proffered to give him a Dram , if he 'd go with us ; but he said , he could not drink any thing . I thought something more than ordinary was the Matter , and therefore was willing to find it out ; but my Friend being in haste to go , I desired him only to watch two or three Minutes , while I called another Acquaintance of mine who was hard by . I went , and as I come back , I met the Prisoner empty-handed . When I came to my Friend , whom I had left waiting , he told me , that he was gone off with a Case in his Hand . Why , I met him just now says I , and he had nothing in his Hand . Then he has thrown it away , says he ; and so we went to look , and found the Show-Glass turned upside down , but it was empty , and we could not afterwards get sight of the Prisoner . Bridget - the Prosecutor 's Maid deposed , That about Half an Hour before the Glass Case was lost , the Prisoner came into her Master 's Shop , and Cheapned a Pair of silver Buckles . The Jury found him guilty of the Indictment Death . John Bollam , of the Parish of St. Giles 's Cripplegate , was indicted for feloniously stealing 22 Guineas and 10 s. the Money of Henry Clayton , on the 5th of November last . It appear 'd that the Prosecutor had sold an old House , and laid the Money upon his Beds Tester . The Prisoner , and Henry Clayton , Jun . ( the Prosecutor 's own Son ) were great Cronies together , and knew where the old Man had hid his Treasure . They got the old Man to the Prisoner 's Lodging , and there left him , and when he came home again , the Money was all gone . But there being no positive Proof the Prisoner took it : The Jury acquitted him . Mary Thomson , of the Parish of St. Andrew 's Holbourn , was indicted for privately and feloniously stealing in the Shop of Edward Walker , 3 Ells of Holland , value 11 s. 6 d. the Goods of Edward Walker , on the 24th of May . Edward Walker thus depos 'd . The Prisoner came into my Shop along with a Gentlewoman of good Credit , who had been her Mistress , and who bought several Pieces of Linnen ; and therefore I had not the least Suspicion of the Prisoner ; but the Thing was found out by a Miracle , as a Body may say ; for you must know , Sir , that the Floor of my Shop was a little broke , and my Man being in the Cellar , and hearing some Woman in the Shop , he peeps up this Hole in the Floor , over which the Prisoner happen 'd to stand , and what should he see under her Coats , but - a - this Piece of Holland ; and so up he comes , and tells me of what he had seen : We tax 'd her with it , and she soon confest that she took it .

Henry Brewer , late of the Parish of St. Mary Woolnoth , was indicted for feloniously and privately stealing from William Goddard , a Handkerchief , value 3 s. on the 13th of May .

I searched him , and found this Penknife , and Tortoise-Shell Snuff-Box in his Pocket , and this Cane was found at a Chandler's-Shop , where he had left it ; but he told me that he bought it in St. Paul 's Church-Yard , for 7 s. The Prisoner in his Defence said , that he found the Ring and the Snuff-box , at the Shop-door , after he had been sweeping the Shop ; the Penknife , he said , his Mistress lent him to cut some Cords with ; and the Cane he only took out to walk with .

Mary Robinson thus depos 'd . Between four and five in the Afternoon , I lock 'd my Chamber Door , and went down Stairs to sit with my Landlady . The Prisoner ( who was an Apprentice to my Landlord Johnson ) came in about 6 o'Clock , took his Master 's Key , and went up Stairs : He staid about a Quarter of an Hour and then came down again , stood a little while at the Door , and went out . I Mistrusted Nothing all this Time , and when I went up Stairs , I found my Door lock 'd ; but I no sooner open 'd it , than I saw my Drawers open . I examin 'd farther , and found that my Money bag was empty 'd , and my Rings and my Silver Spoons were gone . I call 'd to my Landlady in a Fright , and told her I was robb 'd , and she going into her Room , found that she was robb 'd too . James Robinson thus depos 'd , I am a Beadle , I was along with some Constables . At the Feathers Tavern in Drury-lane , we heard a Man and some Women of the Town in the next Room , and thereupon we went in , and found the Prisoner with a Couple of Whores . He was very much in Drink , and we found a great deal of Money , Spoons and Snuff-boxes about him . We carry 'd him out to the Bear-Inn , and desired the Keeper of the Tap-house , to take care of him till he was sober , and not let the Whores come near him , for fear they should plunder him ; but he would not take any Charge of him , till we had taken an Account of what Money , and other Things the Prisoner had about him , which we did , and left him there . The Keeper of the Tap thus deposed . The Morning after the Prisoner was left to my Care , he pretended that he was come away from his Father , without his Consent , and said , that he would stay still the Evening , and then go and lye at the Bell-Savage-Inn on Ludgate-hill , that he might be ready to go out with the Coach in the Morning , for he intended to go to a Relation of his in the Country ; but in the mean Time , his Master the Prosecutor found him out , and I delivered to him the two Broad-pieces , the Gold Rings , and other Things that I had in Charge . William Johnson thus depos 'd . I am a Taylor by Trade ; the Prisoner came from Monmouth , and he was put as an Apprentice to me upon Charity ; he behaved himself well , and never lay out of my House till the Night I lost my Goods out of my Bureau ; I heard that he had been seen in Drury-Lane , and so I walk 'd up and down there several times ; at last I saw him in the Window at the Bear-Inn . I went in , seiz 'd him , found my silver Salt in his Pocket , and he confess 'd to me , that my Watch and Snuff-box were gone to be mended in Fleet Street ; besides what I had back from the Man of the Inn .

John Fawdery thus depos 'd . I saw the Prisoner Jones lurking about my Shop-door , and in a little while a Man brought him in , and asked me if I had lost any Thing . I look 'd about , and mist a Lump of Allom . He deny 'd the Fact at first , but afterwards confess 'd that he had taken it , and it was carry 'd to the other Prisoner Davis 's House , in St. Katherines-lane , and upon search it was found in her Cellar ; but there being no Proof that she received it knowing it to be stoln . The Jury acquitted her ; and found the other guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Transportation .

John Perry thus depos 'd . I keep the Cock and Magpye Ale-house , the back of the new Church in the Strand . The Prisoner had been my Servant about a Fortnight . On Saturday the 23d of April last , about 4 in the Afternoon , my Wife had fetch 'd down a Bag of Money , to change 2 or 3 Guineas for a Customer , and being in a Hurry , she put it into a Seat in the Bar , which had no Lock to it , and while she was busy about the House , the Prisoner ( as we afterwards found ) took that Money , and went away with it . I advertiz 'd it in the Evening Post , of Tuesday , April 26. by which Means I with the Prisoner in Duke-Street , Picadilly ; and got between 40 and 50 l. of my Money again , which he at last confest was mine , tho ' for a long Time he deny 'd that he had ever seen me before . Mr. Sarch thus depos 'd . I live in Germain-street , near St. James 's Church . The Prisoner came to my Shop on Monday Morning to buy a Holland Shirt , we agreed for 7 s. and then he asked if he could not have Ruffles set upon it , I told him-Yes . Then says he , I want some Scarlet Camblet for a Suit of Cloths . - Upon this I began to view my young Gentleman , and finding that he had got a Sword by his Side , and but indifferent Rigging , I asked him where he came from He told me from Dublin . Which Way , Says I . Why from Dublin to Cork , says he , and so to West-Chester : But why did you come without better Apparel , says I . Why , says he , my Father and I disagreed , and so I left him . - But how many Yards will make me a Suit ? I do n't know exactly , says I , but I 'll call down my Taylor , and he shall take Measure of ye , which was quickly done . I must go to the Play to Night , says he , and therefore pray let the Ruffels be set upon my Shirt time enough . - Have ye ne'er a Coffee-House or Tavern here-abouts . Yes says I , there 's a Tavern hard by . He went thither , and cameback in about half an Hour , a little Fuddled , and said he had drank three Pints of Mountain . - Then he went in the Neighbourhood , and hir 'd a Lodging , for which he gave half a Guinea earnest , and returning to my House , and seeing a young Woman there , he invited her to go and take a Glass with him , but she refusing , he said he 'd sent for a Pint home . I told him he should send for none to my House , but however he went to the Tavern himself , and sent a Pint over . - When he came back again , he went up to lye upon my Bed , and let fall a Bag of Money . I took it up , and counting it over before Witness , found there were 40 Guineas and an half , 2 Moidores , and half a Broad-piece in it . I had a violent Suspicion of my Spark , and while he laid upon the Bed , I look 'd over the Advertisement in the Weekly Journal , and found one that to my thinking , answer 'd the Description of the Boy , with Directions to carry the Person to Mr. Webster , in King-street . When the Prisoner got up , I began to talk with him , and shew 'd him the Advertisement , he look 'd on it , and said , I am not the Boy . - Well , then says I , will ye go with me to Mr. Webster , he read the Advertisement again , and after a little Pause , he consented . We went , but Mr. Webster did not know him . Mr. Webster thus depos 'd . A young Gentleman having left his Father , the Father desir 'd me to let him advertise for his Son to be brought to me , that he might be expos 'd as little as possible . It was I suppose upon reading this Advertisement that Mr. Sarch brought the Prisoner to me ; but tho ' he was not the right Person , I thought there were many suspicious Circumstances in his Case , and therefore I privately desir 'd Mr. Sarch to take care of him , for at least a Day or two longer , and I did not doubt , but that I should make some Discovery . Accordingly next Day I examin 'd the News Papers , and found the Prosecutors Advertisement , by which means I found him out , and brought him to the Prisoner . Is this your Servant , Sir , says I . Yes , Sir , says he . What 's that 's you say , Sir , ( says the Prisoner to him ) do you pretend to know me , and thus he brazen 'd it out for a long while , but having search 'd him , and taken the Money from him , he at last confest that the Prosecutor was his Master , and that he had robb 'd him of that Money . We have since heard that the Prisoner was this time 12 Month , try 'd at this Place , for stealing a Guineas of Katherine Gilburn , in the House of his Master William Davis , and after that he lived at the Unicorn in Aylsbury , where he likewise robb 'd his Master . The Jury found him Guilty to the Value of 39 s. George White , of the Parish of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for feloniously stealing a Callimanco Gown , value 6 s. and a Callimanco Petticoat , value 3 s. the Goods of Dorothy Williams , on the 10th of September last . Dorothy Williams thus depos 'd . In September last , I lost this Gown and Petticoat out of my Box ; they cost me 40 s. and were but little the worse for wearing , and I found them again upon this good Woman Dennis Foxon . Dennis Foxon thus depos 'd . The Prisoner came to an Ale-house where I live , and said his Wife was dead , and he had got her Gown and Petticoat to sell , which were these here , and I bought them of him for 9 s. The Prisoner in his Defence said , that he bought the Clothes in Rag Fair for his Wife , but she being dead he sold them again . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] James Cherry , and Mary Claxton , of the Parish of Stepney , were indicted for breaking and entring the House of William Gill , and taking from thence 4 Shirts , value 30 s. 4 Smocks , value 20 s. 7 Holland Aprons , value 10 s. 6 Draper Napkins , value 10s . 2 Table Cloths and other Things , the Goods of William Gill , on the 5 of April last , in the Night time . William Gill thus depos 'd . I went to Bed about 12 and was call 'd up again between 2 and 3 , and found my House broke open . The Groove of the Kitchen Shutters was cut away , the Shutters laid in the Street , and the Sashes put into the House , and the Linnen which hung in the Kitchen , taken out . Mr. Gill 's Wife depos 'd to the same effect , and his Maid Elizabeth Speed added that she made all the Doors and Windows last , when she went to Bed . William Claridge thus depos 'd . I was in company with the two Prisoners , at the breaking open this House : I cut the Groove , took down the Shutters and the Saines , crept in , opened the Door , and let them in , and we took away the Linnen and pawn 'd some of it in Southwark , on the Day that Blewet and Burnworth were hang 'd in Chains . Elizabeth Price thus depos 'd . Claridge and the Prisoner Cherry came together to my House , and pawn 'd this Linnen to me for 15 s. but the Prisoner Claxton , was not with them . Cherry in his Defence said , that Claridge was his Brother in Law , and desir 'd him to go with him to pawn that Linnen , which he did , but knew nothing of its being stoln .
