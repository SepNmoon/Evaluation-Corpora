Margaret Skylight * , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing one pair of Gold Ear-Rings set with Diamonds , Value 30 s. the Goods of John Segalas , November 15 . * She said her right Name is Scarlett , and was 72 Years of Age . John Segalas . I am a Gunsmith in Green-street by Leicester Fields , the Prisoner came one Day to my House under Pretence of telling my Wife 's Fortune , ( she had been there before , and my Wife had ordered her to come again ) she told my Wife she had good Fortune , or something very lucky in her Face , that her Planet was at hand ( I can not remember the Words ) and that there was a great Treasure left in the House by a deceased Person , and the Soul of that Person could not be at Rest till my Wife had it ; I think she said it was 160 or 260 Guineas besides a large Quantity of Silver ( I was at work in a little Closet and over-heard them , and went out to see what they were upon ) she asked my Wife if she could lend her 20 s. unknown to me ; my Wife said she had not 20 s. about her ; says she , have you got any Thing of the Value of 20 s ? My Wife said she had her Diamond Ear-Rings ; the Prisoner asked her if they were worth 20 s. she said they were worth a great deal more : My Wife gave the Ear-Rings into her Hand ; the Prisoner asked her if she had got any Salt ; my Wife gave her some , and the Prisoner wrapped the Ear-Rings up in a piece of Paper with the Salt ; the Prisoner at the Bar said I must not be there , for if I staid it would spoil the Thing , for it was my Wife 's good Fortune and not mine ; for by Virtue of this the Stones were to rise in the Cellar , and the Treasure would appear ; so I went into the Shop , and left them by themselves : My Wife came into the Shop , and told me she believed the Prisoner had a mind to steal her Ear-Rings . The Prisoner told me , my Wife was troubled with an evil Sprit , and had no Faith ; and that she thought there was something more than ordinary the Matter with her ; and she told my Wife , that she seemed mistrustful , and that because she was mistrustful the Planet would be spoiled . I saw her slip the Ear-Rings away , and I thought that she had changed the Packet ; upon that , I immediately seized hold of the Prisoner 's Hand ; and in the Paper instead of my Wife 's Ear-Rings there was a pair of brass Buttons ; and in the struggling one of the Ear-Rings dropped down , and the other I found between her Finger and Thumb . She put the Ear-Rings up in the Salt : they were not tied up , they were only wrapped up in a little bit of Paper . Prisoner . You say a false Thing , it is not so . Winifred Segalas . The first Time the Prisoner came I was at the Door , and there was a Quarrel in the Street facing our House ; the Prisoner said to me , what Quarrel is that , Madam ? said I , I can not tell , I know nothing of it : She asked me if I had any old Clothes to sell ; I told her no . Says she , you have a lucky Planet in your Face , I will tell you your Fortune : I said come in ; she asked for some Coffee , but I had none ; so she said she had a Law Suit depending , and she must make an end of it ; that she could not stay then , but would come another Day ; and when she came she made me say , In the Name of the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost , that I would do all that she proposed to me . She asked me if I had any Paper that was never wrote on ; I told her I had ; I fetched her a Sheet , and she divided it into three Parts . She asked me for some Salt ; I fetched some Salt , and she said by the Virtue of that Salt the Mould was to rise in the Cellar , and the Money was to come up . I can not tell the Sum of Guineas she mentioned to my Husband , besides broad Pieces , and Silver ; then she asked me if I had got the 20s . that I told her I would get against that Day . She made me make that Bargain with her before , but I did not intend to give her the 20 s. She asked me if I had the Value of 20 s. about me ; I told her I had a good deal more ; that I had a pair of Diamond Ear-Rings ; she asked me how much they were worth ; I told her they cost me 3 Guineas ; then she said , In the Name of the Almighty God , Father , Son , and Holy Ghost , put them into this Paper , and then she said , God Almighty prosper what we are a going upon : Then she asked if I could say the Lord 's Prayer , and said I must fall down on my Knees and say the Lord 's Prayer three Times over , and by Virtue of this the Mould in the Cellar was to rise , and I should find the Treasure . I stepped out and told my Husband , that I had a Fancy the Woman wanted to steal my Ear-Rings , so he bored a Hole through the Door to watch her , and if he found I could not deal with her , he was to help me : She had the Ear-Rings in a Paper , I looked at her and saw her slip them away , and I thought changed the Parcel : They were to be tied up in this Handkerchief , and I was to swear that I would not open the Handkerchief before she came again ; my Husband seized hold of her Hand , gave me a Paper , and said to me , look what you have got there , and in the Paper there was a pair of brass Buttons ; when my Husband seized hold of her Hand , he said my Wife 's Diamond Ear-Rings are here ; she denied it , spoke a great many scandalous Things , and swore and cursed very much ; but in the Skirmish one of the Ear-Rings fell down and broke in two , and the other he took in her Hand . The Prisoner owned she had been there three Times , denied that she knew any thing of the Ear-Rings , that he must force the Ear-Rings upon her , in order to charge her with the Robbery . Guilty .

Prisoner . He says I was always in his Sight , ask him whether it was dark or Moon-light . Heath . It was dark . Prisoner . I have lived 15 Months at that Place , at the Blue Anchor , and it is as dark as a Dungeon , and if I had robbed the Woman , which I never did such a Thing in my Life , he could not see me , and he says he could , he takes a false Oath . John Good , ( a Corporal in the Guards . ) As I was coming up the Hill from the Savoy , a Gentleman cried out stop him ; the Prisoner would have given me the Pocket , and all that was in it , to let him go ; says he , I am a Brother Soldier , I belong to the third Regiment of Guards . - I do not know that ever I saw the Prisoner before ; this is the Pocket he had in his Hand when I took him . Prisoner . Did not I say I found the Pocket , and would give it you , for it is none of mine ? Good . You said , here is a Pocket , Brother Soldier , I will give it you if you will let me go .

I keep the Horse-shoe Alehouse in the Strand , the Prisoner had used my House about a Fortnight or three Weeks , and in that Time I had lost two Mugs . My Man suspected the Prisoner , because he went often into the Yard , and advised me to secrete myself upon the Stairs ; he came in about five or six Days , I went upon the Cellar Stairs and secreted myself ; and when he thought the Way was clear he unlocked the Cupboard Door , took out a Mug , put it into the Breast of his Coat , and carried it backward , and threw it into a Hole ; when he came in I perceived he had nothing about him : Some Time after I thought he was going to fetch the Mug , or to knock it to Pieces , I took a Candle , and found it in a Hole covered over ; said I , are you not a Villain to rob me ; so he asked me what Damage I had sustained by him , and he would give me a Note for the Money - I told him I would be as favourable as I could . John Bush . The Prisoner came that Evening between 4 and 5 o'Clock , and I hid myself on the dark part of the Stairs to watch him till he came out of the Yard , and I saw him lay his Hand upon the Cupboard Door , but some Body coming in prevented him ; and after that my Master caught him .

Q . What without tying him ? Pugh . Yes - I knew with the Horse he was upon that he could not ride away from me : When I got him to Missingham , he begged very hard to speak to the Gentlemen he robbed in the Coach ; I took him into the Room to them , he fell down on his Knees , and asked their Pardon ; he sai d he had lost a hundred Pounds the Night before at my Lady Mordington 's , and that it was the first Fact that ever he committed . - Holland .

I said , with all my Heart ; I went in with the Woman , and she and I went up Stairs , and another Woman ( not the Prisoner ) brought up a Pewter Thing full of Brandy - I can not tell what Measure it was ; the Woman who carried me up took hold of me , made use of some odd Expressions , and falls back upon the Bed , and tumbles me o ' Top of her ; said she , I must feel you ; no said I , I do not want no Body to feel me , nor I do not want to feel no Body ; why ? said she , You Son of a B - h , you are poxed ; I told her , if I was , I did not want to pox her nor no Body else , for you shall not feel me . So I asked her what was to pay for the Cup of Brandy ; I put my Hand in my Pocket , and pulled out half a Crown to pay the Reckoning ; I put my Hand in my Pocket again , because I thought that was too much to trust them with , as believing it to be a bad House . I had in my Pocket two English half Crowns more , an English Shilling , two Six-pences , and some Halfpence , and I paid the other Woman ( not the Prisoner ) for the Brandy ; I was coming down Stairs , and the Prisoner laid hold of me , and said , You Son of a B - h , you have not paid your Reckoning ; and then she called to her Cousin , and a Woman came down - the Woman that carried me in : They opened my Breeches , and took my Money out ; the Prisoner clapped her Arms round about me , the Woman who carried me in took all I had in one Pocket , which was two half Crowns , one Shilling , and one Six-pence ; she opened my Breeches , and turned my left Pocket inside out ; and the Prisoner slipped her Hand into the right Pocket of my Breeches , and took half a Crown from me and some Papers ; I desired she would not keep my Papers , so she delivered me my Papers again : After they had plundered me , they wanted me to stay in the House all Night ; they put the Money into a Girl 's Hand , and sent her away with it , then I went out of the Door , and said , I was robbed ; I was not above six Minutes in the House - I was prodigiously frightened when they took hold of me ; I could not tell what to make of it ; I did not know but they might have killed me . I found the Constable about six Minutes after in the House where I was robbed ; the Coachman * had brought him in to take them up ; I told the Constable , I was robbed , and gave him the same Account as I do now , and he secured the Prisoner : He asked me , if I could shew him the Room where I was ; I said , yes ; I took a Candle , but I was afraid to go up ; said I , You must go up before me ; he went up with a Sword , but we found nothing ; I said , I believed , I had lost twenty five Shillings , but not being used to Sterling Money , I could not tell the Sum cleverly , either then , or now - * The Prosecutor on the other Indictment .

On the 18th of September last , as I was going out of Town , the Prisoner came down Stairs , I thought she was not well , and asked her what was the Matter with her , she said she was extremely Ill with the Gravel and Stone ; I desired her to send for Mr. Warner , a Surgeon , to come to her , but in talking with her , I thought I observed that she was fallen away , and suspected she had been with Child ; I taxed her with having been with Child , she said she had voided a great Quantity of Water , that she was better , and said that she had not been with Child ; I talked to her of having the necessary House opened , to search if any Child was there , which she insisted upon in order to clear her Character . On the 9th of November , I received a Letter from Mrs. Porter from Lincoln , where the Prisoner came from , in which she acquainted me , that she was two Months gone with Child before she came from thence ; I told her of the Letter , and asked her concerning it ; she then owned she had miscarried , and that she was five Months gone with Child when she miscarried ; I sent for a Carpenter , and had the Vault opened , and there was a Child found . Q . Did you see the Child ? Mr. Porter . I saw it , but it was at some Distance , for it was so very nauseous , I did not care to come near it . Joseph Warner . I am a Surgeon ; on the 9th of November I was sent for by Mr. Porter to come to his House immediately ; when I came , he said he had found out what he had long suspected ; his Maid 's being with Child : He had the Vault opened , and a Child was found ; he desired me to look at it ; I viewed the Child , but it had lain in the Soil some Time , so that the Skull was separated one Bone from another . Mr. Porter asked me , whether I thought there had been any Violence done the Child ; I said it had lain there so long , that I could not form a Judgment whether there had or no . Q . Was it a Male or a Female Child ? Warner . I took the Child to the best of my Judgment to be a Female Child , though it had lain till I could scarce tell what Sex it was ; I was asked what Growth I thought the Child was ; I said it was so large , that I believed it might be about nine Months ; I could not tell whether the Mother had gone the full Time or not - I can not tell whether it was born alive , or not .

Q . Were they Friends before this ? Child . They were not Friends , or they had not fought ; but they fought in order to be Friends with one another ; they had fought twice before , and were parted both Times . Baker had given the Prisoner Challenges several Times - Baker had the better both Times , and that was the Reason he gave him the Challenge , because he thought himself to be a better Man than the other . I was the Deceased 's Second , and took him up when he was down . Q . How often had he been down ? Child . I believe about a Dozen times ; they fought near half an Hour - Baker was down oftenest ; the Prisoner had the Advantage in the Falls , but as to the Blows , I can not tell who had the Advantage . Q . Did they part at last ? Child . No ; Baker was down , and I said , they should fight no more . As soon as the Words were out of my Mouth , they both went away ; and Baker being asked by the Prisoner , whether he would drink , he said , he could not drink , but he would fight him another Time - I am very certain this fight was to make Things up ; for there was a Difference between several of us besides . Q . When did the deceased appear to be ill ? Child . He was ill in about five Minutes after I said he should not fight any longer ; in about five Minutes after that he dropped down , and had not Strength to put hi s Shirt on ; I got him up , but he could not stand long . Q . What do you think to be the Occasion of his Death ? Child . He might over-strain himself in the Fight , but I do n't think the Blows were the Occasion of his Death . Q . Was there any Malice ? Child . There was no Malice . There have been greater and harder Fights than this - When they can not agree , they commonly fight it out ; and it is done in order to be Friends . Q . What Character has the Prisoner among you ? Is he good natured ? Child . He is as good a natured Boy as any in the House . Robert Radless . About 10 o'Clock the Night before they fought the Prisoner desired me to be in the Church-yard at 7 o'Clock in the Morning : I was to be the Prisoner 's Second . They met and fought . I can not say there was any foul Play - The Deceased did not express any Dissatisfaction ; the last Word I heard him say , was , I will fight you another Time . Child . He never spoke any more after he said he would fight him again another Time , but he groaned very much - It was a fair Fight . Jeffery Gillingham . I am one of the Arts Masters ; the Prisoner is as good a natured Boy as any Man ever had , or as ever came into a House . - Ray .

On the 8th of April last I had Occasion to go to Hampstead , and coming back again between eight and nine o'Clock , it was dark , there was no Moon ; coming into the third Field from the Half-way House towards London , ( between the posts I was obliged to turn myself round ) a couple of Men met me , one clapped a pistol to my Breast , and cried , Hollow ; upon that I answered Hollow again , and then they said , Your Money ; upon that I said , Gentlemen , what I have is at your Service , do not use me Ill ; when the Man clapped the pistol against me , his Hand trembled , so that I put my Hand against the pistol , and pushed it from me ; so I extended my Arms , and they rifled my pockets , and robbed me , as I take it , of upwards of eleven Shillings ; they took my Hat and Wig off my Head ; I said , Gentlemen , do not use me Ill , I have very tender Eyes , and my Bread depends upon my Sight , and if I lose that , my Family must starve ; upon that they put my Wig on my Head , but kept my Hat , and they took the other things laid in the Indictment .

Q . Have they separate Barracks , or do they all lie in one Room ? Allen . They have separate places , about seven Feet square , with a Lock and Key to each Barrack - There are two generally to a Barrack ; Bowring lay in the Barrack where the Gloves were , and gave us the Key to open it - Bowring . What Time was this done ; I can not tell any Thing of it ; what Day of the Month was it ? Lane . It was Friday the 8th of April . John Smith .

Q . How came you to know his Name ? Smith . He told us his Name , and his Name was upon the Ticket . Q . How came he to tell you who he was ? Smith . I can not tell , he talked almost all the Time we were robbing him . Q . Did you discover this to any Body till they threatened your Life ? Smith . No ; they threatened to kill me , because I refused to go a robbing with them any longer , and I discovered it to James Allen the Serjeant . Jury . Had you your Ammunition Clothes on ? Smith . We were all in blue - we were not in our Regimentals - They were Clothes we wore when we were off Duty ; I had mine before I was listed . Q . What did you do with the Things ? Smith . We distributed them among us ; I had the Hat , Bowring had the Gloves , and Barrett had a bigger share of the Money than we had ; the Gloves Bowring wore when he went into the Country ; for we all deserted together ; when we were put into Handcuffs , Bowring wore one Glove , and I wore another ; the Handcuffs made Marks upon the Gloves ; these are the Marks . Barrett . You have sworn this Robbery against us ; what had I ? Smith . You had six Shillings in Money ; Bowring and I had Half a Crown a-piece , to the best of my Knowledge ; there was a Groat , and we had a full-pot of Beer as we went along . Bowring . On Tuesday the 15th of March , I and Elizabeth Smith , and my Wife , went to see Barrett in St Thomas 's Hospital , he was in a Salivation ; when I had been there about half an hour , John Smith brought this Hat in , and he took his Knife , and said , he would cut that Button was Loop off , and would have a Gold one ; he said he had stole two pound of Cheese from his Mother ; I took him by the Arm and turned him out of the Room , and said , if he would rob his Mother , he would rob me . Smith has owned I shewed him this Hat the 15th of March , when the Robbery was committed the 8th of April . Elizabeth Smith confirmed what Bowring said , with regard to the Hat , and that John Smith said , his Uncle Frank gave him it . John Death . The Witness Smith said in Clerkenwell Bridewell , being asked how he came to do so , as to be an Evidence against these people , that he would rather have given 50 l. than have done what he has done , only he was egged on for the sake of the Reward - I lived three Years with the Marquis of Carnarvon ; I do waiting Jobs as a Coachman , & c. Elizabeth Bear . I went along with Smith to Clerkenwell Bridewell , and he said , he was very sorry to swear against these Men , only he was put upon it for the Lucre of Gain . William Firmery . John Smith had reported , that he had lain with Bowring 's Wife , and that she had poxed him ; and Bowring threatened to do him a Mischief , because he said his Wife had poxed him ; then Smith said , he would be revenged of Bowring , for he would take his Life away . Bowring . I believe my Wife heard him say so ; this is a designed thing to take our Lives away , for the sake of the Reward . Both Guilty , Death . 61.

Philip Eales , of St. Mary le Strand , was indicted for assaulting Pugh Willis , putting him in Fear , and taking from him seven Guineas , his property , in the Dwelling-House of the said Philip Eales , Nov . 23 . 67. Philip Eales and Mary Eales , wife of Philip Eales , were indicted for stealing ten Guineas , the property of Pugh Willis , Nov. 23 . Pugh Willis . The 22d of November at Night , or the 23d in the Morning , about four o'Clock , I was coming from St. James 's , and just before I came to Eales 's Night Cellar in the Strand , it is on the left Hand coming from St. James 's by the New Church , four Men swore at me , and told me , that I should go down and drink - They did not go down , two of them went away , and two of them staid to see me go down . Q . Did you go down voluntarily ? Did they use any Threats in order to make you go down ? Prosecutor . They held up their Fists , and I thought it the safest Way to go down . Q . When you came down , what was the first Thing that presented itself to you ? Prosecutor . There were two or three people standing , and Philip Eales with another Man in a mean Dress like a porter were playing at Hustle Cap ; I called for a pint of Beer , and drank it ; they asked me to play , I refused it , but they said I should play ; I thought that the little Money I had in my pocket - five Guineas and some Silver , was not to be put in Competition with my Life ; then there were six people come in with great Coats , and Brass Buttons , who appeared to be Chairmen - I did not play , but laid on Eales 's Head - I did not know him , I never saw him before - I laid on his Head , because I thought him the most lucky person for me to lay on - I laid once or twice half a Guinea , and then a Guinea a Time afterwards - I did not win at all - I won but one 10 s. 6 d. and that he paid in Silver honestly , and what I lost I laid down upon the Table , and that the Man that played with him took up - I saw no more than about half a Guinea in Silver . Q . What did the Man say when you laid such Wagers ? Prosecutor . He said nothing in the World - I lost five Guineas , and eight or nine Shillings in Silver . There were four Fellows like Chairmen sleeping in a Box , and lying upon the Floor ; Eales took them all four by their Legs , and dragged them out , and where-ever he laid them , they lay , and did not stir , and put me into the Box where they were ; I did not remain there any longer than till a Candle was got , then he took me by the Arm , and carried me into an inner Room . Q . Was this with or without your Consent ? Prosecutor . It was certainly against my Consent if I had my Will , but I was afraid ; I had given my Watch to him before - for six Guineas he lent me ; I went into this inner Room , and laid on his Side still till I lost these six Guineas - I never played myself at all - There were in this inner Room Philip Eales , this other Man that played , and I , and Eales 's Wife , who lay upon the Bed in her Clothes ; I said to Eales , if you will give me my Watch again , I will go home and fetch Money to redeem it ; then he said , You owe me six Guineas , if you will bring me six Pounds nine Shillings and six Pence , you shall have your Watch ; I went home in a Chair , and brought twelve Guineas ; when I returned , I was introduced into this Room , and I immediately tendered him 6 l. 9 s. 6 d. and demanded my Watch ; the Prisoner d - d me , and bid me hold my Tongue , and told me I should play with the other person that he had played with , and then I should have a Chance ; I said I only came for my Watch , and desired he would give it me , and told him I would not play ; he held up his Hand as if he would strike me , and swore by G - d I should play ; I played , and in a little Time had the good Luck to win twelve Guineas - I won it of the Man that Eales was before playing with , and the Man paid me . Q . What did Eales do with the Money he had of you ? Prosecutor . Eales said he had lost every Farthing of the Money , but he did not lose any Thing then as I saw ; then as I was not a great Loser I was for going away , Eales then snatched up ten of these twelve Guineas which I had upon the Table just by me ; I asked him what he meant by this , he swore G - d d - n him he would owe it me ; I said , I did not understand that ; he said , G - d d - n me , he would make me understand it , and he threatened to strike me , if I did not hold my Tongue , so I did not speak a Word till I saw Eales lose all this ten Guineas with the Man he played with before - It was about nine or ten o'Clock in the Day when I first came out ; we played all the while by Candle Light ; I believe it is dark there at all Hours of the Day . Q . What was the next Thing that was done after Eales had lost the ten Guineas with this Man ? Prosecutor . I was going to see for my Hat and Cane to go away , the Woman Prisoner got hold of me , and my Feet hitting against the Bed-post , I made a little slip , and she pulled me down upon the Bed , and wrapped me in the Blankets ; I lay for about three Minutes , and then she went away and left me ; he came in again , and said , who wrapped you up so ; I said , his Wife ; he d - d her for a B - h for serving a Gentleman so ; she said , she thought it was the best way for me to sleep , for it would do me good . Q . Was not he jealous of you and his Wife ? Prosecutor . I am sure he had no Occasion to be jealous of me ; he went out of the Room , and was not gone above half a Minute , before he brought in a Book , and swore that I owed him twelve Guineas upon a Book Debt , and that he would have all the Money in my Breeches for it , and then he put his Hand in my pocket , and took to the Amount of seven Guineas , and upwards . Q . Had you paid Eales the six Guineas ? Prosecutor . Yes . Q . Upon what Occasion were you at St. James 's ? Prosecutor . It was the Day that was kept for the King 's Birth Day - I staid at St. James 's till three o'Clock in the Morning - Q . Is not there a good deal of Burgundy going forward upon these Occasions ? Prosecutor . I do assure you I did not drink above three Glasses of Wine there , and then I came to this Place . Q . You say it was between nine and ten when you went away ; when you were got to your Lodging , how came you to go there again ? Prosecutor . Because he had got my Watch , and it was a Watch that I valued . Q . Could not you have staid till Day Light ? Prosecutor . It was Day Light when I went away - I only took the two Chairmen who carried me to my Lodging - The people did not use any uncivil Expressions to me - I was afraid , because I conceived a bad Opinion of the people of the House - merely from being forced down there ; for if these people made no use of me after they got me into the Cellar , what Occasion was there to force me down ? Q . You said four people said you should go down and drink ; did neither of these four go down ? Prosecutor . Not that I saw - I did not observe that any of them were in Liquor . Q . Was not you in a gay Humour , and wanted to play without being asked ? Prosecutor . No ; I did not . Q . How came you by the Chair ? Prosecutor . I can not tell how the Chair was got , so I suppose they got it . Nicholson , a Chairman . I carried the Prosecutor home about ten in the Morning , and did not perceive him to be in Liquor . - Gray ( Constable ) I had a Warrant from Colonel De Veil , and went to Eales 's Cellar , I saw his Wife in the Bar , and asked where her Husband was ; she said , he was in Bed ; the Prosecutor said there is your Prisoner , and charged him with robbing him ; he went very readily with me , and said , the Gentleman was not robbed there : When we came before the Colonel , he asked him for his Gold Watch ; Eales sent me home for it ; I told the Maid I came from her Master for the Gold Watch , and she gave it me very readily . William Speck . I asked the Prisoner when he was before the Colonel , where the Watch was ; she said , I have made Money of it , and then he said it was at Home ; the Prisoner afterwards begged my Interest with the Prosecutor ; said he , Consider what Life and Death is , get them to make it up , and I will resign the Watch , and part of the Money . Justice De Veil . The Reason of my sending for the Prisoner was upon the Deposition this Gentleman made , and I think it is not the same he makes now : He came to me , I believe the same Morning he was robbed , a nd he was so much in drink then , that I refused to take it ; I told you you were in drink ; I am sorry to say you do not swear the same now as you did before me ; you swore then you were hauled down Stairs . Both acquitted . 68 , 69 , James Ford * , and William Perremount , of St. Mary Woolnoth , were indicted for stealing two dead Fowls , value 2 s. and a pewter Dish , value 2 s. the Goods of Francis Parsons , Nov. 4 . * James Ford , otherwise called Doctor , was tried last June Sessions with Richard Warwick , and John Hudson , for a Felony , and acquitted . See Trials 331 , 332 , 333 . Page 202. Francis Parsons . I live in Lombard-street ; on the 4th of November I lost two Fowls , and a pewter Dish ; I saw them taken from Perremount when he was brought back to my House . Thomas Toller . I and another were going down Lombard-street , I saw a little Boy pass by Mr. Par-son 's Window several Times , these two Fellows ( the Prisoners ) were together , one of them gave a Whistle , and the Boy shoved the Sash up , and took something out ; I went to a Watchman , and desired him to assist us in the taking them ; and he said , Pshaw , pshaw , I do not see them , let them go ; the Prisoners were pursued , and taken in White-chapel . Francis Mitchel confirmed Toller 's Evidence . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] + 70 , 71. Charles Flood , and Charles Bargame , were indicted , for that they not having the Fear of God , nor weighing the Duty of their Allegiance , & c. but devising and intending our Lord the King , and his people , craftily , falsely , unlawfully , deceitfully , feloniously , and traiterously , to deceive and defraud , after the 29th Day of September , 1742. to wit , on the 1st Day of December , in the 6th Year of his Majesty 's Reign , with Force and Arms , at the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , in the County of Middlesex , craftily , falsely , unlawfully , deceitfully , feloniously , and traiterously , did fill , and with certain Materials , producing the Colour of Silver , did wash and colour two pieces of Brass Money of this Realm , called Farthings , with Intent to make each of the said pieces resemble , look like , and pass for , a lawful piece of Silver Coin of this Realm , called a Six-pence : The Indictment farther charged them , that they on the 1st Day of December , & c. did alter the Impression on each Side of two Farthings , with the like Intent ; and the Indictment did likewise set forth , that they on the said first Day of December , & c. did wash and colour the said two Farthings , with the Intent as before ; and this was laid to be against the Duty of their Allegiance , against the peace of the King , and against the Form of the Statute . At the Desire of the Prisoners the Witnesses were examined apart ; upon that the King 's Council moved , that the Witnesses for the Prisoners should not be in Court while the King 's Witnesses were examined , and they were ordered to withdraw . John Graham . I have known Flood about three Years , and Bargaine about two Years ; I have seen them file Farthings , and make them into Six-pences , and Half-pence into Shillings - I was concerned with them in the doing it ; first we file the Britannia off , and take the Ribbon off , which hangs by the Side of the Neck on the Head Side , and alter the Head to make it look like a Six-pence , and then file them to the Size and Thickness of a Six-pence ; after that we polish them with a piece of Leather to take off the Scratches and Roughness of the File ; then we put them into a little Hand-vice , and put a bit of Leather between them and the Vice , to prevent it from marking them , and then bend them and whiten them over , so as to make them look like Silver , by rubbing them with Aqua Fortis , Cream of Tartar , and burnt Silver , made into a Sort of a paste . [ This Witness proved the Experiment . ] Then we used to put them off at Chandlers Shops , Bakers Shop , or where we could . I have put off five or six in a Day ; we always went single - Sometimes we took out twenty or thirty at a Time , sometimes but two or three ; if two of us went out together , only one went into the Shop , the other was placed at a Distance with a Quantity of this Money : He that went into the Shop had but one , and when he had parted with that he came to the person that had the Bag for another . [ There were two of the altered Farthings showed to the Witness . ] These are like them , they are King George the Second 's Farthings . I am positive to both the Prisoners , they used to work at this Business at Garret Cavenagh 's * and Patrick Kelley 's . - I made my first Information last Christmas Day past . * Garret Cavenagh , and his Wife , and Patrick Kelley , and his Wife , were tried last January Sessions , and convicted of High Treason , upon the Evidence of this John Graham , and others . See Trial 116 , 117 , 118 , 119 . Page 70 . Q . Have you seen them alter more than one , to make them resemble and pass for Sixpences ? Graham . Yes ; I have seen them do a hundred - I have seen both the Prisoners go through all the parts of this Business , altering the Impression , filing them to a Thickness , bringing them to the Breadth , polishing them , bending them , and silvering them over , and I have seen them pass them off . Q . Were you never informed against for this practice ? Graham . I was in Custody in the Year 1738 , and since that Cavenagh and Kelly laid an Information against me for counterfeiting the same . Q . And you were an Evidence against them , and now you have the good Fortune to be an Evidence against these persons ? Graham . Yes ; I have . Q . Have not you been so kind as to desire a little Money of Flood ? Graham . Yes ; perhaps I have ; ask me what you will , and I will answer you . Q . Have not you sent to Flood to demand Money of him , and to tell him , if he did not give it you , you would turn Evidence against him ? Graham . I had had some Difference with Flood , and in August last I met him and Bargaine , and four or five more by Camberwell , with Hoes and Sticks , and I was afraid they would do for me , because they knew what I had done ; they came up to me , and said , are not you afraid to do so and so ? I said , you threatened to lay an Information against me , and I do not know for what , for I never endeavoured to hurt you ; Says Bargaine , I am going to Portsmouth to Morrow , I will give you a couple of Guineas if you will not be Evidence against me ; so he gave me a couple of Guineas ; I thought I would give them good Words till I got away . Q . Did you go away with the two Guineas ? Graham . Yes ; they gave them me in a Day or two ; I went to Labouring Work , and there was a Constable on the other Side of the Water , that said Bargaine was taken up for a Robbery in Surrey ; [ he is brought here by a Habeas Corpus ; ] I went to Mr. North that Night with a Constable to prove he was the Man - I can not fix the Day I made the Information . Q . Did you know Dennis Kennedy , and Rose Kennedy ? Graham . Yes ; I know them to be Affidavit people ; they are vile wicked people ; there is such a parcel of this Irish Gang about , that if this place was Diamonds they would swear it . Sarah Graham confirmed the Evidence of John Graham , with Respect to the Prisoners performing every Branch of that Business , and that they have done this till their Fingers have been blistered , and that sometimes they were so hot they would stick to their Fingers . Sarah Graham . Flood 's Wife has put off twenty six in an Evening , and Bargaine 's Wife twenty four or twenty five many an Evening - The least we put off was twenty four or twenty five of a Night ; when we went out we used to say to one another , Good Luck to you ; we used to lay them out for some small Matter or other , and get good Money in the room of them - I have seen the Prisoners fell the Filings of the Half-pence and Farthings for 7 d. per pound . [ There was a Box of paste produced . ] Mr. Bargaine had such an one , and Mr . Flood had such an one - I believe it is the same Stuff [ smells at it ] it is the same Sort of Stuff ; sometimes they have cut them cross the Face , and then they would pass better than another ; and they said they would serve the K. so if they could : There are several people here to swear against me , Flood 's Sister , & c. Mr. North produced two pieces of Money resembling Six-pences , which had been altered , and which he had of Mr. Matthews , and which he said were both Copper Farthings of the present King 's . Mr. Matthews . I keep a Publick House , the Swan near St. George 's Church , Southwark , Charles Flood and two more came for a full pot of Beer , and Flood gave me this Farthing for a Six-pence ; I rubbed it upon the Floor , and delivered it to him again ; said I. honest Man , what makes you use me so , it is but a Farthing ; then they gave me this , I returned it again , and afterwards desired them to let me see them again , and they gave them me ; said I again innocently , Methinks you are full of this Sort of Money ( I can not say that ever I saw Bargaine ) Flood took an Apple out of his pocket , and flung this Box [ the paste for colouring ] out of Doors , and there was the print of one of these pieces in the Apple ; this was the 18th of November , 1741 . Q. Recollect yourself how long this was ago ? Matthews . It was two Years ago the 18th of last Month . Q. to Graham . Were you ever concerned with them since Cavenagh and Kelly were tried ? John Graham . No , not in this Way - I was taken up this Month was twelve Months - I saw Bargaine and Flood making Farthings into Six-pences , and Half pence into Shillings , the Week before I was taken into Custody ; I was taken up for an Assault , and made myself a voluntary Evidence in this . Sarah Graham - I can not justly remember how long it was before my Husband went into Confinement ; I saw them making some about a Fortnight before Christmas , I believe it was about the eighth or tenth of December ; the last I put off for Mr . Flood and Mr. Bargaine was for a Quarter of a pound of Sassasras . - Boyle . I took Bargaine up some Time in February last upon the Information of Graham , and by Clerkenwell Watch-house he made his Escape ; the next Time I saw him was in the New Goal in Southwark ; a little before last Sessions Graham and his Wife charged me with him . It appearing that the Farthings , which were produced , had been altered and uttered before the Commencement of the Act of Parliament , which did not take place till the 29th of September , 1742 , and there being no working Tools or Materials for that purpose found in the possession of the Prisoners , they were acquitted . + 72 , 73. Simon Emanuel , and Samuel Moses , of St. James 's Westminster , were indicted for stealing a repeating Watch , with two Gold Cases , and a Shag Case , value 25 l. the Property of the Right Honourable Lord Viscount St. John , in the Shop of John Seddon , August 1 . The Prisoners were indicted separately , though it is here put into one Indictment . Samuel Moses not understanding English well , Abraham Bendictus was sworn Interpreter . John Seddon . The beginning of August I lost a Gold repeating Watch out of a Closet in my Shop ; I did not miss it for five Days , I took my Day Book to examine what Watches I should have , and missed this ; I advertised it , and in about seven or eight Days Elias Mordecai came and asked me if a Watch had not been taken out of my Shop ; I asked him , if he could help me to it ; he said he had seen such a Watch in the Hands of some Jews ; I asked him his Intent in coming , and that I supposed he came to see if he could get any Thing for himself ; I told him , I would give him two Guineas , besides twelve Guineas I had advertised , if he helped me to it ; he came again in two or three Days , and asked my Servant if he could know the persons who were in the Shop ; he said , yes ; he appointed him to go on a Saturday Morning at the Time they came from the Synagogue , and my Man knew one of them ; says Mordecai , do not meddle with him , I know where to find him . I let Mordecai have a Guinea , and he came one Day and desired I would go with him to Pimlico , by Buckingham-House , and when I came there was Simon Emanuel ; I asked him , if he could give me any Account of this Watch ; he told me , he was with the person who had pawned it , and described it to me , but then I did not know he was one of the persons who was in my Shop ; I was to have had my Watch brought me , but they wanted a farther Reward of four Guineas . Emanuel was brought before Justice De Veil , November 5. and his Examination taken in Writing - He did not own he took it , he owned he was in the Shop with Moses ; he said , I should either have my Watch , or a valuable Consideration for it , if I would put off his Examination from Saturday to Monday . I never had it again , I can not supply it under 45 l. I never saw Moses till I saw him at the Bar . Elias Mordecai . I deal in Glasses ; I set my Basket one Day upon a post , and saw Moses show a Watch to two Gentlemen , when he was gone , I heard the Gentlemen say he is a pretty Fellow to have a repeating Watch ; I knew him to be a person of a bad Character ; then I went about my Business ; five or six Days after , I read in the Advertiser , that there was a Watch lost belonging to Mr. Seddon ; I went to him , and asked him , whether he knew which way he lost it ? he said , no ; I told him I saw such a Watch showed to two Gentlemen ; said I , how came you to let alone advertising it so long ? if you had advertised it , these Gentlemen might have stopped it : I thought Simon Emanuel could tell me whether I could get the Watch or no ; said I , you were walking with such a Man , and he had a Gold repeating Watch ; yes , says he , Samuel Moses has ; said I , do you know how he came by it ? he said , he could not tell ; said I , you will have a Guinea down , and afterwards a Reward of twelve Guineas , if you can give any Information of this Watch : Emanuel said , I will not make any Noise about it ; do you go to Mr. Seddon , and ask him , whether there was a Key to the Watch ; says he , I will be as good as my Word , and tell you where the Watch is , for I was by when it was pawned . I went to Mr. Seddon , to ask if it had a Key ; and he said it had no Key ; I spake to Moses about it one Day , and he said , if I would have patience till Monday , he would produce the Watch - Emanuel said , it was pawned to one Marks a Jew in Houndsditch ; and Moses was by at the same Time and did not deny it - Moses said , he had pawned it , but he did not say where . Sarah Mordecai . My Husband was in a Passion with Moses about the Watch , and Moses said , do n't be in a Passion , tell the Gentleman if he will stay till Monday , I will make every thing easy . Gilbert Trow . The beginning of August the two Prisoners came to my Master 's Shop , and asked for a second-hand Silver Watch ; I shewed them some , and Emanuel was the Interpreter : I could not tell the price of the Watches , so I desired them to come again : The Watches hang on Hooks in the Closet ; Moses came into the Closet , and Emanuel stood on the out-side of the Closet ; then Moses went without the Closet , and Emanuel desired a large Silver Watch to be taken down , and Emanuel said , This will do ; and I apprehend when I handed that Watch to Emanuel , Moses took this off the Hook ; for the Watch was hanging there when they came in - I am very constant in the Shop , and am very certain I saw no Body in the Closet since the Time it was seen till the Time it was missing but them - When Simon Emanuel was carried before the Justice , he said , he would not make any Confession , because he desired it might be put off till Monday ; but he owned he was in the Shop . Moses was taken up for a Robbery at Ipswich ; I went to him in Newgate , and said , how do you do , Mr. Moses ? Said he , I do n't know you . Said I , Do you know Mr. Seddon in St. James 's ? He seemed to be a little at a Stand ; said I , do you know any thing of the Watch of my Lord St. John 's ? He said , When I come before the Judge I know what to say ; but he said , a Dutch Jew who is gone abroad had the Watch . I went with Mordecai to Marks , the Jew , and asked him for the Watch ; he denied that he had it ; I said , If you will deliver me the Watch , I have twelve Guineas in my Pocket to give you , which is more than you lent upon it : He took me by the Collar , and was going to shove me out of the Shop ; I said , I came from my Master , and desired him not to use me ill ; he bid me go about my Business . Lazarus Jacobs . I am a Spectacle Maker ; I never knew Simon Emanuel guilty of an ill Action . Thomas Simkins . I am a Watch-Maker ; I have known Emanuel these two or three years ; I never heard any Harm of him . Abraham Benedictus . I am in the Watch making Business ; I have known Emanuel from an Infant at Amsterdam ; he goes with People as an Interpreter , either to buy or sell ; I never knew any Harm of him . Elias Soloman . I am a Lapidary ; I have found Emanuel to be a very honest Man . Acquitted . + 74 , 75 , 76.

Abraham Benedictus was sworn Interpreter to Samuel Moses and Solomon Athorn . William Young . I am a Silver-Smith ; on the 9th of November , I went to Bed about 11 o'Clock , and about 2 or 3 I was alarmed by my Boy , who lies in the Shop ; he came up Stairs , and knocked at my Chamber Door , says he , For God 's sake come down , for I am afraid your Show-Glass is gone ; and the Street Door is wide open . I jumped out of Bed , called out Watch , went down Stairs , found the Shop Door open , and the Show-Glass taken away ; and I lost the Things mentioned in the Indictment : I found the Kitchen Window broke open , where there is a Door and an Area - I did not see the Door fastened that Night ; I found in the Kitchen Window a Head of a Chissel in two Parts tied together , and a hammer ; upon my calling out , three or four Watchmen came , and in about an Hour and a Quarter a Watchman brought my Show-glass back again , with about nine or ten Pounds worth of Goods in it . On the 21st of Nov . I received a Letter from Justice Sparrow of Ipswich , wherein he acquainted me , that the three Prisoners were apprehended , and that there was the Body of a Quart Silver Tankard taken upon them , and the Lid ; and that upon a strong Suspicion of a Robbery , he had committed them to Ipswich Goal ; I went down to Ipswich , and at Justice Sparrow 's I found my Tankard , the Body , Lid and Handle all separate ; I know it by the Marks upon the Handle M. H. and E. C. it was a Family Tankard of my Wife 's ; I have had it about four Years . I found these two Snuff-Boxes , which I am positive are mine ; I should have known them from a Thousand , and this Silver Watch-Chain ; I knew it , though it was fixed to Samuel Moses 's Watc h. I found these Thimbles , I know one of them to be mine by the Letters M. Y. the fellow of this Ear-Ring was left in the Show-Glass ; these I found at Justice Sparrow 's . William Richman . I am Constable of Ipswich ; on the 17th of November I had a Warrant from Mr. Cox of Colchester to search for the three Prisoners by their Names , for they had robbed him . I took them all up ; they had Nap-Sacks with them ; I would not suffer them to go up to their Chambers , but fetched them down out of the Chamber which they were to lie in ; they owned they were bound for Holland ; I found the Body and Lid of the Tankard in Michael Jude 's Nap-Sack . The Justice asked , how he came by it ? He said , he found it at Chelmsford in the Street . The handle was not found till next Day ; they had conveyed that into the Street ; I should not have found them out , if it had not been for that I found ten or eleven Thimbles ; one of them was marked with M. Y. I found these two Snuff-Boxes in Samuel Moses 's Pocket . Young . These are mine . Richman . Solomon Athorn went by the Name of Selick ; but I found out his Name was Athorn ; I was told , that Selick is Dutch for Solomon . Abraham Benedictus . It is the same as Solomon . Richman . I do n't know of any Thing but Money that was found on him , or any Thing that Mr. Young owned . Thomas Cox . I drive the Colchester Coach ; these three Prisoners came to me the 15th of November at Chelmsford , and wanted to go to Colchester ; I carried them to Colchester , and one of them lodged at my House ; I went to London the 16th , came back the 17th ; my Wife told me I was robbed by the three Jews ; I went to Ipswich , got a Warrant from Justice Sparrow , and took them - There was nothing taken from Athorn but Money concealed ; the Tankard was taken out of Michael Jude 's Nap-Sack , but there was no Handle , and the Chain off Samuel Moses 's Watch . Rebecca Spragg . I have been Servant to Mr. Young about four Years ; I fastened the Door and the Kitchen Window about eleven at Night , and left the Tankard in the Kitchen ; I know the Tankard ; it has been in my Mistress 's Family near 100 Years . William Prior . I lay in the Shop ; the 9th of November , between two and three in the Morning , I heard the ratling of a Chain upon the Counter ; I cried out , What are you ? No Body answered , but I heard a Foot go out of the Shop ; I heard the Glass break , and then I went up Stairs and called my Master . Young . The Handle was found the next Day , and brought to Justice Sparrow 's ; then Jude said , he had it of Selick to fell , and that Selick said , if he would not do it he would inform against him . Moses would have made a Confession upon Condition of being made an Evidence ; Justice Sparrow said , if he would make an ingenuous Confession of all the Robberies they had committed , he should have Favour ; and then Moses said , that he and Joseph Mckoy were at a Night-House the 9th of Nov. between twelve and one , and then went to the other end of the Town to Young 's House - Selick owned that he made the first Attempt , but could not break open the Door , but Mckoy and he broke it open ; that he did go down into the Kitchen and take the Tankard ; and Mckoy said , sure there must be something more , and then they took the Pepper-Box , and Selick said , he had six Gold Rings , which he sold to a Portugueze Jew ; he said , that Jude was not there at the Time of the Robbery , but that he showed them the House in the Day-Time , when Moses and Mckoy were with him - Moses owned the Fact , and that he was upon the Watch . Richman . I heard Selick say , that Michael Jude showed him the House in the Day-time , but that he was not in the Robbery . Moses owned he was at the breaking of the House , and went in ; Moses made the first Confession . Moses . I bought them of Mckoy and Selick ; I can prove it . John Garret . I have known Moses about two Years ; he deals in Black-lead , he has the Character of a civil honest Man . John Davey . I have known him about two Years and a Half , he always bore a good Character in the Neighbourhood . Rebecca Jevens . He has been a Lodger in my House between three and four Months last past , and always behaved in a very regular civil manner ; he never was out of my House after twelve but one Night , and that was about six Weeks ago . Levi Jacob , Thomas Howard , and John Fountain , gave Samuel Moses the Character of a civil honest Man . Aaron Lazarus gave Michael Jude the Character of a very honest Man , and Mordecai Lazarus said , he had trusted him with some hundred pounds worth of Goods ; that he was his Servant abroad ; that he has known him two years in England , and that he always had the Character of an honest Man . Samuel Solomon . Michael Jude has a very good Character here and at Amsterdam . Guilty , Death . + 77 , 78. Thomas Broughton , and Samuel Jackson , of St. Mary at Hill , were indicted for assaulting Thomas Hobson on the Highway , putting him in Fear and taking from him four Guineas and six Shillings , his Property , Oct. 25 . Thomas Hobson . The 25th of October in the Morning I was going down Thames Street , Broughton brusles up to me , and laid his Hand upon me ; I being a little infirm , he had like to have thrown me down ; said I , What do you assault me in the Street ? He brusles up to me again , and made a Noise thus , Boh ! Boh ! Boh ! he did not speak ; then I believe he picked my pocket ; in about a Minute 's Time I missed my purse : coming down Love Lane , Mr. Rutherford , a Gentleman who was passing by , seeing me in a Surprise , asked me what was the Matter ; I told him , I had been robbed of a Purse of Money ; he said , I saw two Fellows go into the Cock , and one of them had a Purse in his Hand ; I went into the Cock , and in the House I saw the Prisoners ; I said to Broughton , You are the Man that robbed me ; he said , I do n't know you ; I said , You have got my Purse ; he said he would stand Search ; the Purse was found upon a Seat near where the Prisoners sat . Prisoner . It is very improbable I should put a Man in bodily Fear in the middle of the Day . John Rutherford . Coming down Love Lane , I saw the Prisoners , and one of them had the Purse in his Hand ; they seemed in a Hurry , and scuffled along very fast ; I took very good Observation of them - To the best of my Knowledge Broughton had the Purse ; I described the Marks of it before it was found - I went into the Alehouse , turned short , and said , these are the Men , and Mr. Hobson went directly to Broughton , laid his Hand upon him , and said , you are the Man that robbed me - We found the Purse on the Seat where Jackson sat , the two Prisoners sat at a Table opposite to one another . Robert Powell . The Prisoner offered to stand search , and said , What do you think a Gentleman of my Function would rob any Body in the Street ? We got a Candle , and in a Hole at the Corner of the Seat there it was . Edward Walford and John Bust said , the Purse was found as before mentioned . Broughton Guilty of the Felony , Jackson acquitted . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 79.

See summary . ] + 83. Peter Rogers , otherwise Lewis Jonaquire , was indicted , for that he after the 29th Day of June , 1729 , to wit , on the 2d of December , in the 17th Year of his Majesty 's Reign , at the Parish of St. Botolph without Bishopsgate , in London , did forge and counterfeit , or cause to be forged and counterfeited , a certain Paper Writing , purporting to be a Bill of Exchange for the Payment of a certain Sum of Money , which said Paper Writing is in the Words and Figures following . Amsterdam , 6me Decem . 1743 , pour 25 l. Sterl . A vile paiez cette seule de changed Dordre de Monsieur Jacques Laurent la somme de vings cinq livres sterling , valeur requ de Monsieur De la Fontaine , que posserez suivant Davis de Jean Isaac Fremeaux . A Monsieur Monsieur Pierre Muylman , sola Londres . And this is set forth to be done in order to defraud the said Peter Muylman of the said Sum of 25 l. of lawful Money of Great Britain , against the Peace of the King , & c. He was a second Time charged for publishing this Bill knowing it to be forged , in order to defraud the said Peter Muylman of the said Sum of 25 l. Henry Muylman . This Day Sev'night about ten in the Morning the Prisoner came to my House and brought a Letter directed to my Brother Peter Muylman , and delivered it to me ; I suspected it to be a Forgery , because the Bill was drawn on Peter Muylman only , and our Correspondents draw on Henry and Peter Muylman . I told him , my Brother was not there , and I did not care to open it ; he said , I believe there is no Secret in it , you had as good open it ; accordingly I opened it , and in this outermost Letter here was a Bill of Exchange , and another Letter inclosed , in which was only Advice of this Bill of Exhange ; one Letter was in English , the other in French . The English Letter was read . December 2 , 1743. `` SIR , Having received Yesterday from my `` Friend Mr. de la Fontaine , in Amsterdam , a Bill `` of Exchange for 25 l.

LAURENT . '' Henry Muylman . I have translated the French Letter ; I did not stand so much upon the Nicety of the Stile , as the Truth of the Translation - It is a true Translation . [ The Translation of the Bill of Exchange was shewn to Mr . Muylman . ] Mr. Muylman . This is a true Translation of the Bill of Exchange drawn on my Brother . Amsterdam . December 6 , 1743 , for 25 l. Sterling . At Sight pay this my sole Bill of Exchange to the Order of Mr. James Laurent , the Sum of 25 l.

The French Letter I take to be in Substance as I have translated it - This is New Stile , it is the 25th of November in Holland . The Translation is as follows . To Mr. Peter Muylman . Amsterdam , December 6 , 1743. `` SIR , Having Occasion for a Parcel of Rice `` and Pepper , I have the Honour to write to you `` this my first Letter of Advice , and desire you to `` be so kind as to buy for me at the current Price `` twenty five Bags of black Pepper , and fifty Bags `` of Carolina Rice .

I desire you to Honour `` this Bill , and when you draw for the Rice `` and Pepper , draw likewise for the Amount of `` the Bill. `` Your humble Servant , `` Jean Isaac Foremeaux `` Henry Muylman . I appointed the Prisoner to come to me again at two o'Clock ; the Moment he was gone I went to my Brother at the East India House , and acquainted him with it ; he told me it must needs be a Forgery ; when I came Home I sent for a Constable , and ordered my Man to be in the Way ; soon after the Man knocked at the Door , I bid him come into the Parlour ; said I , Do you come about the Bill of Exchange you brought in the Morning ? He said , Yes , Sir ; said I , This Bill of Exchange is endorsed Blank , and it is usual for the Person who receives the Money to testify it to be the Hand of the last Endorser , and desired him to witness it , to prove that it was the Writing of James Laurent the last Endorser ; I asked him , whether he would be paid in a Bank Note , or Money , he said , Which you please ; then I said witness it ; he said , Sir , I can not write ; then said I , make your Mark ; when he had made his Mark , the Constable wrote these Words , The Mark of Peter Rogers ; when he had witnessed it , I told him I had a strong Suspicion that it was not a fair Thing , and insisted that he should go before Sir Edward Bellamy ; Sir Edward interrogated him , who he was , what he was , and where he came from ; then instead of saying he came from Mr. Laurent at Richmond , as he had told me , he said the Bill was given him by a Gentleman in the Street , who bid him carry it to my House , and bring the Money to him at Tom 's Coffee-House , whether he meant Tom 's Coffee-House in Cornhill , or any other Coffee-House , I can not tell : This Contradiction put Sir Edward upon asking many other Questions ; he asked him , whether he could produce any Body to his Character ; he said , no Body knew him in the City ; Sir Edward told him the Presumption was strong against him , and he must be obliged to commit him ; then he fell down upon his Knees , begged very hard to be discharged , and desired to speak with me alone ; then he told me , if I would intercede for him , he would confess all ; I told him , as I was before a Magistrate , that I did not know whether my Intercession might prevail ; he confessed the Whole to me , and afterwards to Sir Edward ; I believed he repeated it six Times over - He confessed the counterfeiting the Bill of Exchange , the Letter of Advice , and the Letter from Mr. James Laurent . Q . Did he write , or did he not ? Mr. Muylman . After he had confessed , he begged he might not be committed ; but when he saw his Commitment was making out , he said , What a sad thing will this be for my Wife , who has not a Farthing in the World . I put my Hand in my Pocket , and gave him a piece of money ( I speak it to show that by this I found he could write . ) Sir , said he , I do n't care what becomes of me ; I desire you would send this to my Wife . I desired he would give me a Direction where I should send it : He took the Letter , and wrote upon the Back of it with a Pencil , as good a Hand as need to be wrote . I pressed him very strongly ( as there was so great a Difference between the two Writings ) to let me know who was concerned with him ; and I said I was informed there was somebody concerned with him ; he said , he was the only Person who forged the Letters and the Bill ; and he would not let other People suffer for the sake of his Life . As he was carrying to Newgate in a Coach , he said to the Constable , I hope I shall be transported , for then I shall go into my own Country . Thomas Blisset . ( Constable ) I saw him make his Mark on the Back-side of the Bill ; he said , his Name was Peter Rogers , and I wrote it as such upon the Bill ; he confessed the forging the Bill of Exchange and the Letters ; Mr. Muylman asked him how he came to think of him any more than any other Person ? he said , Sir , it was the Devil . Guilty of forging and publishing , Death . Mr. Peter Muylman presented a Petition to the Court in favour of the Prisoner . + 84. Thomas Hill , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , in the County of Middlesex , was indicted for feloniously counterfeiting and resembling upon a certain Paper and Thread inclosing a Pack of playing Cards , the Impression of a Seal , Stamp , and Mark , made and used , in Pursuance of a Statute to seal , stamp and mark each Pack of playing Cards with the said Stamp , to denote the Payment of the Duty of Six-pence charged on each Pack of playing Cards , intending thereby to defraud the King of the said Duty , and did defraud the King of the said Duty , against the Form of the Statute , and against the Peace of the King his Crown and Dignity . He was likewise charged for uttering , vending and selling one Pack of playing Cards , with a false and counterfeit Seal , Stamp , and Mark fixed on a certain Paper and Thread inclosing the said Pack of Cards , knowing the said Stamp to be false and counterfeit , intending thereby to defraud the King of the Duty of Six-pence , and did defraud the King of the said Duty , against the Form of the Statute , & c. He was also charged for uttering , vending , and selling one Pack of Cards , made fit for Use in Great-Britain , with a false and counterfeit Stamp on the Paper and Thread , inclosing those Cards , knowing it to be false and counterfeit , against the Form , & c. and this is laid to be on the 10th of Nov. in the 17th Year of his Majesty 's Reign . The Council for the Prosecution set forth , that this Indictment was founded upon an Act of Parliament made in the 10th Year of her late Majesty Queen Ann , in order to prevent the counterfeiting the Impression of that Stamp which was provided by that Act of Parliament , to secure the Duty which the Legislature had laid upon Cards , and also to prevent the selling of Cards with a false and counterfeit Stamp , knowing it to be false and counterfeit ; that the Prisoner had these two Charges against him , both of which were by that Statute made Felony , without Benefit of Clergy ; that the Act directs , that the Commissioners of the Stamp Office shall order and appoint proper Stamps and Marks which are to be put on the Paper and Thread which inclose the Cards ; and that they shall from Time to T ime give Orders for the making such Stamps ; and therefore in order to prove that the Stamp which the Prisoner is charged with counterfeiting was made by order of the Commissioners appointed for that Purpose , Mr. Nock was produced . Mr. W. Nock , Chief Clerk to the Secretary of the Stamp-Office , proved , that the Dye which was counterfeited was made pursuant to an Order of the Commissioners of the 4th of June 1736 , and the Plates for the Ornaments by an Order of the 5th of July 1739 . Mr. Pyne , the King 's Engraver for the Stamp-Office , produced the Specimen , and proved the making of the Plates for the Labels to be pursuant to the Order of the Commissioners of the 5th of July 1739 , from 105 to 117 , from 118 to 131 , from 183 to 195 , from 196 and to 208 . Mr. Tuslian . The Prisoner has been my Servant about eight Years ; about two years and a half ago , he said he wanted to speak to me ; said I , what have you to say to me ? he said , he had a Scheme in his Head , that would turn to my Profit and his own ; he said , he could get a Label made in order to stamp the Cards with , and said , if you will let me have ten Guineas , to get Things in Order , I will get it done ; and I did let him have ten Guineas ; then he said , he wanted a rolling Press ; said I , What do you want that for ? he said , I can not do without it . He got a Rolling-Press , and he brought the Man to me to pay him , and I paid him 40 s. on two Guineas ; then I asked him , what he expected per Week ; he said 18 s. I gave it him ; in a little Time he said , he was only working for me , and would have more ; he said , he would have 12 s. per Week , and 2 d. a piece for the Labels . I found myself under a Necessity of complying with it - The Press was put up in my back Garret in Charles Street by St. James 's Square . I was so ill that I never was in the Garret then nor since . He began to furnish me with the Labels and Stamps about two Years and a half ago , and continued to furnish me with them till within these three Months , only there were some Intermissions when I was sick ; for I used to put the Labels upon the Cards - They are to denote the King 's Duty being paid - I sold a great many Cards with the counterfeit Stamp - I believe four or five thousand - We used more of the Stamp-Office Labels than we did of the Counterfeits - After he went from me to set up for himself , I gave him 2 d. a piece when he worked - He continued but a very few Weeks at 18 s. then I gave him 12 s. per Week , and 2 d. a Pack ; and upon these Conditions he continued I believe about a Twelve-month ; then he left me - I do not know where he worked ; I have asked him several times , and he never would tell me - After he left me he had no weekly Wages , only 2 d. a Pack for the Stamp - I parted with him because he would not stay any longer . He wanted me to leave off Trade , and trust him with all I had in the World ; and because I would not do that , he went away in a Huff , and took a House at the Knave of Clubs in the Hay-Market - The Press was gone out of my House long before our Difference - I never saw it , nor do n't know that ever he used it - I have heard , that the Stamps may be taken off so as to be used again ; I can not tell whether he ever did so ; I never did . Q . What do you call these Papers that inclose the Cards ? Tustian . A Wrapper for a single Pack is called a Jow , and a Wrapper for six Packs is a Sission - The Stamps are pasted on at our Houses by the Officers of the Stamp-Office . Q . Is it not usual for Gentlemen 's Servants to take the Stamps off the Cards with warm Water and sell them ? Tustian . I believe it is done ; but I never asked the Price of one in my Life . Philip Pinkney . I am a Clerk in the Secretary 's Office ; in the Month of September I had an Information , that Thomas Hill the Cardmaker had taken a House in a Passage in Long Lane in Southwark ; I suspected , that he made Cards secretly , and got a Warrant to search ; I found in his Garret a Rolling-Press , two flat Stones , one with some Pink-coloured Paint upon it , and a Stone they call a Muller ; a Grate to set a Pan of Charcoal upon , to warm the Plate over ; red Paint mixed and unmixed ; Oil , Whiting , & c. such as they use in the Office for making the Labels . Upon finding these Things , I suspected that he had counterfeited the Stamp . [ Mr. Hill 's Day Book was produced . ] I think this is what they call his Day-Book . I have examined the Book , and find , that he has sold and delivered to Persons upon Credit , 901 Doz . which is 10812 Packs of Cards , since September last ; and the Prisoner has entered at the Stamp-Office in that Time 7678 Packs [ So that he has sold 3134 Packs more than he has paid the Duty for , besides what he has sold for ready Money . ] This is exclusive of Cards for Transportation , for he gave Bond for them . I verify think this to be his Hand-Writing . Coun . Is not red Paint used in painting the Pips upon the Cards ? Pinkney . Yes , but they do n't make use of Oil in that , but this was mixed with Oil - The Rolling-Press is necessary in the printing of Sissions , but not the Oil . Mr. Pyne . A Rolling Press is not necessary in the Business of a Cardmaker ; there is no Occasion for a Rolling-Press for the Jews , if they are done in Wood , as they commonly are ; Sissions are commonly done upon Copper , but I never knew a Card-maker that made them himself , because they can buy them by the Thousand cheaper . [ Mr. Pyne confirmed the finding the Implements and Materials , as mentioned by Mr . Pinkney . ] Q . Did you find any Plates or Dye in the Prisoner 's Custody ? Pyne . No ; neither Plates , Dyes , nor Stamp ; but there was a Paper found with a Piece cut out of it just the Bigness of the Stamp which is used upon the Cards . Joseph Jarvis . On the 31st of December last , I bought three half Dozen Packs of Cards of the Prisoner , and sold four Packs of them to Mr. Pyne ; I believe these are the Cards , I never had any any where else ; I wrote my Name upon them , and they were sealed up with my Seal . Mr. Pyne . These four Packs of Cards I bought of Mr. Jarvis , and they were sealed up in his Presence ; and for greater Security , Mr. Jarvis and I both wrote our Names upon each Pack of Cards - These are every one of them different Stamps from the Stamp of the Office . Q . Give us an Account what Observations you have made with Regard to the Difference between the Stamp of the Office and that . Mr. Pyne . The first Difference I have made an Observation of , is , that in the Harp , which is the Arms of Ireland : In one Quarter of the King 's Arms in the Stamp of the Office there are but five Strings , in this there are seven or eight , but they are so blind that one runs into the other . The next Observation I made , is , that from the Buckle of the Garter to the end of the Strap is a considerable deal longer in this than in the Stamp of the Office ; and there are four more Stubs or Holes in this for the Tongue of the Buckle to go in , than in the Stamp of the Office . The next Observation is , the Arch of the Crown on the Top of the Garter is more arched , and brought down to the Middle of the Cross of the Crown more in this than in the Stamp of the Office . The next Observation is , that the Top of the Letter ( N ) in the Word Pence under the Garter , is a great deal nearer the Bottom of the Garter than in the Stamp of the Office : Then in the Label there is a great deal of Difference in the Number 201 ( these four Packs are all Number 201 ; ) in the Word ( Stamp ) there is a Difference in the Stroke that goes cross the ( T ; ) the ( P ) in the same Word is different ; the Stroke that runs from the ( O ) through the two ( FF 's ) to the ( I ) is different ; the ( C ) and the ( E ) at the end of the Word Office are remarkably different ; in the Top of the ( F ) and the Tittle of the ( I ) there is a visible Difference ; in the Word ( Duty ) there is a Difference in the ( Y ) and the whole Word ( Pack ) is more remarkably different from the Stamp of the Office ; there is a Difference in the Cypher over the Ornament , it is larger , and of a different Shape - I am thoroughly satisfied they are not the Marks of the Office . Q . You say there are no more than five Strings to the Stamp of the Office . Look at that Specimen and see how many there are here . Pyne . There are more than five Strings here , but this was made in 1714 . Q . Look at the Specimen of 1736 , and see how many Strokes there are there . Pyne . There are no more than five here , that is the Dye in Use ; it never was , and can not be repaired , the Steel is made so hard ; when one Dye is wore out , there is a new Dye made . Q . What Letters are on the present Stamp ? Pyne . Both A and B , they are both used at a Time for Dispatch of Business , only A and B are used for Cards , it is only the B that is counterfeited . Q . Look upon the A and B that are now in use in the Office , and see if there is any Difference . Pyne . It is hardly possible to see a Difference . Prisoner . Does not the pasting on of the Label spread the Dye in the Middle ? Pyne . It can not alter the Distance of the Letters . Mr. Pinkney gave his Opinion , that the Stamp was a Counterfeit , and also the Label , and made several Observations relating to the Difference ; but as he was not an Engraver , he said he could not make so many as Mr. Pyne . Prisoner . Can you take upon you to say , that Mr. Rollis has not made an Alteration in the Dye ? Pinkney . The Dye was never altered , it has never been in Mr. Rollis 's Custody since it came into the Office ; we have had no Dye come into the Office since the Year 1736 ; the Dye is locked up every Night in the Office . Daniel Mckay proved that he bought four Dozen of Cards of Mr. Hill , that he sold eight Packs of those Cards ( which were all he had left ) to Mr. Pyne ; that he knew they were the very Cards he had of the Prisoner , because he sealed them up , and marked them , with his own Name . [ The Bill of Parcels and Receipt produced ] which being proved by Mr. Pinkney to be the Prisoner 's Hand-writing , was read . Mr. - bought of Thomas Hill , July 30 , 1743 . Four Dozen of Cards - - 2 l. 2 s. Received the same Time the full Contents of this Bill , and all Demands . Per Tho . Hill . Mr. Pyne . These six Packs and these two Packs I bought of Mr. Mckay , they are all Counterfeits , for the Reasons I gave before , they are the same Dye , and the same Copper Plate , they are all Number 201 . Mr. Pinkney . I believe I was at the buying of these Cards , here is my Name upon them , I am sure all these eight Packs are counterfeited . [ There were some larger Parcels in Court ready to be produced ; but as the Fact was sufficiently proved , the Witnesses were not examined . ] The following Letter was proved by Mr. Pinkney to be the Prisoner 's Hand-writing . To Mr. Tustian , These . Newgate , Nov. 17 , 1743. `` SIR , I understand you have made yourself an `` Evidence against me , which very much surprized `` me . I beg that you will let me know the `` Particulars of what you have said , for the `` Thoughts of your making yourself an Evidence `` against me , gives me more Concern than being `` in this most miserable Place . I understand you `` have a good Room to be in , but I have none , `` nor no Money for me and my Family , nor no `` Body to come near me of any Signification . I `` beg you will consider of some Method of sending `` me some Money , and a particular Account `` of what you have said , by the Bearer : The `` World I find runs away with a Notion of my `` impeaching you , but I declare before God and `` the World that I never said any Thing against `` your Character in my Life . Pray send what you `` send me inclosed , and an Account of what you `` have said to a most miserable Creature , `` Tho Hill . '' Prisoner . I beg leave to observe , that the sealing of the Cards will make such an Alteration in the Dye , that they are not like one another ; and I have Witnesses to produce , that sometimes Mr. Pyne has said , he could not tell what to make of them . The Prisoner called several Witnesses to his Character , William Masters , John Harris - Calloway , Thomas Taylor , William Crompton , James Miffin , & c. some of whom have known him twelve or fourteen Years , and gave him the Character of an honest industrious Man , and that they do not think he would be guilty of the Crime that he is charged with : Not guilty of counterfeiting the Stamp , but guilty of uttering , vending , and selling Cards with a false and counterfeit Stamp , knowing it to be false and counterfeit . Guilty , Death . The Jury begged the Favour of the Court to recommend him to his Majesty 's Mercy . + Mary Clifford , otherwise Boston , Edward Ettington , and Richard Kaines , of St. Buttolph Aldgate , were indicted for assaulting Margaret Gyles on the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her three Ells of Holland , value 10 s. one Yard of Cambrick , value 4 s. 6 d. and a Silk Handkerchief , value 4 s. the Goods of Samuel Gyles , and a Cloth Cloak , value 10 s. the Goods of Susanna Frenson , Nov. 21 . William Day . I am Beadle and Constable of Portsoken Ward . The 21st of Nov. at Night I was sent for to Mrs. Dudley 's at the Queen 's Head in Harrow Alley , upon Account of two Women being robbed ; Mrs. Gyles and Mrs. Frenson were there ; one of them was just come out of a Fit and very dirty ; they said , they had been robbed by a Woman and five Boys ; Ettington was there , and said that I knew the Persons who had committed the Robbery ; I think he said it was Green-Gown Mary ( that is the Prisoner ) with two Carmen . I took Mary Clifford , that Night , out of Bed at Mrs. Sturgis 's in Gravel-Lane ; and she was next Day committed to the Poultry Compter . The Friday following Mrs. Gyles and Ettington came to me about finding these Carmen that committed the Robbery ; there were some Thieftakers employed , and they brought Pugg to me , that is , this Ettington . Said I , this Person I can take at any time , and I do n't think him guilty ; they said , stay a little while , and we will bring you another ; then they brought Kaines , and Kaines said , he had his Hand under Gyles 's Coats while Clifford committed the Robbery . Margaret Gyles . On the 21st of November , coming along Somerset Street , between six and seven in the Evening , Mrs. Frenson , seeing some Bottles and Glasses in a Window , said she was a little sick , and we went in ; in comes this Mary Clifford and five Fellows ; said Mrs. Frenson , that is the Woman that knocked me down . Said I , you may be mistaken ; you ca n't swear to People 's Faces ; I spoke to the Prisoner , and asked her to go aside [ to a private Place ] - I asked her , because I thought she was not the Person Mrs. Frenson took her to be . I went out , and she with me ; and when we came to the Corner of Somerset Street , coming from Harrow Alley by the vacant Place - about four or five Doors from the Place where we were drinking , she whistled and said , Now you B - h I will have my Revenge on you ; I will cut your Throat from Ear to Ear ; she said she would have my Heart 's Blood , she would present the Blood Bowl to me ; upon her whistling , the two Prisoners and three more Fellows came and surrounded me , and Clifford took Frenson 's Cloak off my Back , and my Bundle from me ; and then they all ran away in a Body together - I am sure that those two Youths are part of the Gang - The five Men rifled my Coats - Both the Prisoners had one Hand , if not both under my Petticoats - They did nothing else , they did not take any thing from me - I never saw the Woman before - I did cry out , but I could not cry out at the first Threatning , because they muffled my Head - One of the Boys went to kiss me with one Hand round my Neck , and the other under my Clothes - It was while they were kissing me , she took the Things - After I cried out Stop Thief three times ; Clifford came back again with the Cloak over her Arm and the Bundle in her Hand . and knocked me down in the Mud , and said , take that in the room of the Blood Bowl . Mrs. Frenson confirmed Mrs. Gyles 's Evidence ; that when Mrs. Gyles asked to go aside , Clifford took her into the vacant Place by Harrow Alley , and whistling , five Fellows came round her , some like Carmen , and some like Butchers , but could not swear to either Ettington or Kaines , any farther than seeing them in the Shop - that one of the five Men put his Hand under Gyles 's Clothes , and another kissed her , while Clifford took away the Bundle , and then ran all away together ; that upon crying out , Stop Thief ! Clifford came back again , and pushed them both in the Mud , and stamped upon the Small of Mrs. Gyles 's Back , and said , you B - h , take that instead of the Blood Bowl . Q . Was there any Lamp ? Frenson . There was a Lamp or two at a Distance , but I could not well distinguish the Prisoners . Q. to Gyles . Did not you see these two Boys that Night at the Queen 's Head in Harrow Alley ? Gyles . Yes . Q . How came you not to charge them then ? Gyles . Because I had no Assistance . Q . You had the Constable along with you , and might have had what Assistance you pleased . Gyles . There was not Assistance enough to carry them to Goal ; I said that Night that Ettington was one of the Fellows - I did not know Kaines so well as the other , that was the Reason I did not accuse him . Q . Did you see these two Boys at the Queen 's Head that Night ? Frenson . Yes - Q . Why did not Mrs. Gyles charge them then ? Frenson . Because she was in a Fit - Ettington said to me , if you will come to morrow at eleven o'Clock , you shall have your Things produced . William Jones . Ettington told me there had been a Robbery committed upon two Women ; I went with him to the Watch-house , and fetched Mr. Day the Constable ; Ettington went with me into the Queen 's Head , and the Women were there , and they did not offer to charge him - I am sure the Women were in Liquor . Day . Mrs. Gyles was just come out of a Fit , I did not perceive them to be in Liquor . All acquitted . + 88 , 89.
