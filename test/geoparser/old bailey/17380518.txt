William Wall , of St. Paul Covent-Garden , was indicted for stealing 39 Guineas , the Money of Mr. Lane , in his Dwelling House , May 6 . Mr. Lane . On Saturday Se'nnight last I went out about some Business , from my House in Bow-street Covent Garden ; in the Evening I return 'd Home , and missed 39 Guineas , which I had left in my Bureau . The next Day , ( Sunday ) the Prisoner who was then my Servant , went out , and not coming Home all Day , I began to suspect he had taken the Money . In the Evening the Man who keeps the Black-Horse Ale-house in the same Street , came and told me the Prisoner was at his House ; that he came thither in a Hackney Coach , and had chang 'd a Guinea to treat the Coachman and a Soldier who were drinking with him . When he came Home , I sent for Mr. Morris the Constable , who search 'd him , and in my Presence took a Guinea out of his Shoe . He did not confess any Thing at this Time ; but when he was before Colonel Deveil , he own 'd he took the Money out of my Bureau ; that he had bought a Gold Watch , which cost him 13 Guineas and a half ; that he had spent some of the Money , and the rest was hid with the Gold Watch in a Vacuity between the Bricks , in the Necessary House at the Black-Horse ; and according to his Confession , the Gold Watch and 13 Guineas were found there . Thomas Hancock , the Soldier . I live in St. Anns Westminster . On the 7th of this Month , about 7 o'Clock in the Evening , the Prisoner sent for me to drink with him ; while I was in his Company he pull 'd out a Gold Watch , I told him he had got a very fine Watch . Yes , says he , I thank God . I am in a good Way of living now . When the Reckoning came to be paid , he pull 'd out a Guinea , and chang 'd it ; and the Landlord seeing he had a Charge of Money about him , perswaded him to go Home . All this Time there was a Hackney Coach waiting for him at the Door , and as he had this Charge about him , I went into the Coach with him , and we rode to Westminster-Abbey , where he treated the Coachman and I with another Pot of Beer . He told me , that neither the Money nor the Watch were his own ; and I asked him how he could make bold with what was not his own ? I hope , says I , all 's well ; yes , yes , says he , all 's well , I know I must make it good again . From Westminster we rode to the Black-Horse in Bow Street , where he treated us again with Beer , and paid the Coachman half a Guinea for his Days Work . After the Coach was gone , he asked me to smoak a Pipe with him , and while I was filling one , Mr. Lane 's Servant came in , and I went out of the Prisoner 's Company . He had about 12 or 14 Guineas in his Pocket when he paid the Coachman . John Morris , Constable . On Sunday was Se'ennight in the Evening I took Charge of the Prisoner , and found a Guinea in one of his Shoes . Upon which he was carried before Mr. Deveil , and charg 'd with this Robbery . At first he would confess nothing , so he was committed for farther Examination ; but when he was brought before Mr. Deveil the second Time , he told us where he had hid part of the Money and the Watch , and according to his Direction , I found 13 Guineas , a Six-pence , and a Penny , and the Gold Watch , behind some Bricks under the Seat in the Necessary House , at the Black-Horse in Bow-Street He acknowledged at this Time it was his Master 's Money , and that he had bought the Watch with part of it . He confessed the whole again on the Thursday following , and that he took the Money out of Mr. Lane 's Scrutore . Luke Hollis . I carry 'd the Prisoner that Day from Place to Place , and I observ 'd he was full of Money , for as I was driving along , he call 'd out , - stop , stop Coachman ; I got down to see what he wanted , and found him picking up Gold from the Bottom of the Coach . Prisoner . I was in Liquor , and do n't remember any Thing of it . Mr. Lane . He had been bottling some Ale that Saturday , if that Circumstance will be any Relief to him . The Jury found him Guilty , Death . 2. Robert Hunt , of St. George 's Middlesex , was indicted for stealing a Brass Drudging-box , value 18 d. the Goods of John Bowers , Oct 1 . Mrs. Bowers . I keep a Publick House in Well-Close-Square , and wear a Gold Chain . He was drinking in the House in a Sailor 's Habit , and while my Maid was gone to buy him some Tobacco , he got up , and came to me as I sat under my Clock , and swore he would have something or else he would blow my Brains out . Immediately he pull 'd out a Pistol and shot me in the Arm ; I kept my Bed 4 Months , and the Bullet is still in my Arm . My Maid was gone for Tobacco for him , and my Husband was then sick a Bed , so he got away , and took the Drudging Box with him . He was afterwards taken , and I was perswaded to let him make himself an Evidence , and he hang 'd 2 Men at Guildford . I swear he took the Drudging box , and I have indicted him at Hicks-Hall for shooting me . Prisoner . Examine her Maid : This Woman took me up in the County of Surrey for this Fact . Eliz Cooper . I have liv 'd with my Mistress Bowers 8 Years . She took the Prisoner to be a poor Man , so she let him lie 2 Nights in the House , and gave him Victuals . The 3d Night he came with the Man that was lately hang 'd at Guildford ; and the Prisoner said he would treat my Mistress with a Supper for her great Civility to him . After Supper he sent me out to buy him some Tobacco , and I was returning into the House , I heard the Pistol go off ; I ran into the House , and saw the Box full of Smoak . Lord ! says I , what 's the Matter ! Lord ! says my Mistress , the Rogue has kill 'd me . He threw his Arms about her Neck and would not let her come out of the Box , so I call 'd him Rogue , and attempted to run up Stairs , but he then left my Mistress , and caught hold of me ; he d - mn 'd my Eyes , and said , if I spoke a Word he would kill me . However I got from him , and went out to call the Watch ; the Flower-box was then standing upon the Table , but when I came back , the Prisoner was gone and that too . Prisoner . Did not I pull out half a Guinea to pay the Reckoning ? Bowers . Yes . Prisoner . Yet the Maid swears the Mistress maintain 'd me . Eliz . Symonds . The Prisoner took out half a Guinea at the white Table , and desir 'd Mrs. Bowers to change it ; immediately I heard the Pistol go off , and saw the Smother , and she cry 'd out , he had kill 'd her . Prisoner . Ask her whether she saw any Pistol , either upon me or my Comrade ? Symonds . No , but I saw the Hole in her Gown Sleeve , and the Blood running about . Some Time after , - but not that Night , she said he had stole her Drudging box . Prisoner . They 'll all swear a Cow 's a House This Bowers keeps a Bawdy House . She took me up 3 or 4 Sessions ago ; I made my self an Evidence before Sir John Lade , and hang 'd my Comrade at Guildford . Jack Thrift the Hangman , - please to call him . - he knows I hang 'd my Companion and another Man there , and now she thinks to hang me , - for her Drudging Box If I am to be hang 'd for her Drudging-Box , what signify 'd my making myself a King 's Evidence . Daniel Malden who broke twice out of Newgate , was taken at this Woman 's House . I own myself a Rogue before all the Honourable Court ; but Jack Thrift knows I cast two Men at Guildford . I have paid many a Pound for frequenting this House , and if I was to die To-morrow , I never was guilt of so pittyful a Theft . She herself wanted to buy a Watch of me for her Husband . Tis a likely Story indeed - that I should shoot her , when I lodged in her House , and at this very Time there were People drinking there . Acquitted . 3. Honour Penery , was indicted for stealing a Brown Silk Gown , a Cotton Gown , two lac 'd Caps , three Cambrick Handkerchiefs , a Holland Apron , a Cambrick Apron , and a check 'd Apron , the Goods of Jane Ellard , in the Dwelling house of John Pullen , in the Parish of St. Bride 's March 20 . Jane Ellard On the 19th of March I was going along one of the new Streets near Grosvenor-Square , and two Women came up to me from the other Side of the Way , and told me I had a mighty pretty Gown on ; - pray , says one of them , what did it cost a Yard ? I informed them what I gave for it ; Oh ! 't is a sweet pretty Thing they said , - pray which Way are you walking ? I told them I was going to look after a Place ; they said I should have the Refusal of two or three very good Places , and if I would tell them where I liv 'd , they certainly would come and give me Directions about them . I told them that I should be very much obliged to them , and that I lodged at Mr. Pullen 's , in George-Alley , by the Ditch Side . The next Day as the Bells rung Eleven , they came up Stairs ; I am very positive to the Prisoner ; the other Woman that was with her pass 'd for the Prisoner 's Mistress . I asked them about the Place they were to help me to , but they told me they were Apprentices to Sir Isaac Newton , at Turnham-Green , and that they must first calculate my Nativity ; so out they pull 'd a great Book with Heads and Hands in it ; they told me a vast deal out of the Book with the Heads and Hands in it , and said I must bundle up all the Things I had , - Rings , Money , and Cloaths . I have but little Money , says I , and I do n't Care to bundle up my Cloaths , that can relate nothing to my Fortune , - that 's quite silly , and if any body should hear this Business besides our selves , they would laugh at us . Well , they argued with me a great while , and said it must be done , and began to be angry because I would not do it . Why , - says one of them , suppose you were Sick , and a Physician comes and prescribes Physick for you , - if you wo n't take it , what Good can he do you ? 'T is all the same Thing , we ca n't pretend to do you any Good , unless you'il do as you are ordered . At last I bundled up all my Cloaths , and they went away , but they returned again , and asked me if I had done as they bad me ? I said I had , and that I had put them in my Trunk . Then now , says the Prisoner 's Mistress , - with the Blessing of God take them out of your Trunk ; I did so : Now , says she , with the Blessing of God , get a Ha ' p'orth of Brown Paper . I did not care to go for the Paper , so she went herself , and did up all my Cloaths , telling me they must be done up very close , and not a Breath of Air must come upon them . When this was done they bid me down upon my Knees and say the Lord 's Prayer ; I refused at first , but by fair Means and foul they made me at last say the Lord s Prayer . Then they bid me turn about and open the Windows , which we had shut , for fear any body should see what we were about . I opened the Windows , and in the mean Time they chang 'd the Bundle , and left this in the Room of it , - 't is full of nothing but Hay and Straw ; my Bundle was made up exactly like this Bundle , and they carry 'd it quite off . After they had put down this Bundle instead of mine , the Prisoner 's Mistress said she must treat with me upon such a Spot of Ground , and bid me , - because it rain 'd , - put on my Hat , least I should catch Cold . I went out with them as far as the Royal Bed , the Corner of Holborn , there they told me a young Man was to meet me , and would give me a Gold Ring , charging me not to look at my Bundle 'till Eight o'Clock at Night ; at Eight o'Clock I found myself a great Sufferer by them , for all my Cloaths were gone , that I had worked for a great while . Some little Time after I got a Place at the Corner of Shoe Lane in Holborn , and about a Fortnight after I had been there , I saw the Prisoner go by the Door ; I was so fluster 'd , that I had no Power to get off my Chair , but by and by I saw her come past again ; then I ran after her and begged a young Man to stop her , for she had robbed me . He call 'd after her , Hark ye ! Hark ye ! - and stopped her . She was brought back to my Master 's House , from thence she was carried to Guildhall , and so sent to Newgwate . Prisoner . It was not I that did this , my Landlady knows I never had any Companion belonging to me in my Life , nor did I ever in my Life see any Conjuring Book . Mary Lee . I can say nothing to this Fact , but the Prisoner robbed me of two large Silver Spoons , two small Spoons , two Gold Rings , and several other Things , exactly in the same Manner ; I said the Lord 's Prayer , and this was the Bundle she left me instead of my own . Prisoner . I am a Mantua-maker , and never kept Company with any other Woman in my Life . I am as innocent as the Child that is born , - and welcome is the Grace of God . Elizabeth Woods , Elizabeth Wheeler , and Elizabeth Whiting , never heard of the Prisoner 's being a Conjurer , never heard Harm of her , nor ever saw any fine Book with Heads and Hands in it in her Custody .

Joseph Hodson , was indicted for privately stealing from the Person of John Pye , June 23 , a Promissory Note , No H. 229. and subscribed Daniel Race , on Behalf of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , bearing Date June 2 , value 500 l. by which Note the said Daniel Race , on Behalf of the said Governor and Company , did promise to pay to Nat . Bracey and Company , the Sum of 500 l the Property of John Pye , the said Sum of 500 l. being then unpay 'd and unsatisfy 'd unto the said John Pye . The Council for the King having open 'd the Charge , the Witnesses were call 'd . Mr. Pye . I receiv 'd this Note , among others , on the 23d of June last , from Mr. Bracey 's , in Lombard Street ; and being to pay some Bills that Day to Sir William Billers , and likewise to attend a Trial at Guildhall , I went first to Sir William 's , but he unhappily was not at Home . From thence I went to Guildhall Coffee-House to meet my Attorney , who told me the Trial was put off , to the Week following ; but Mr. Serjeant Hussey going by , Mr. Eustick , my Attorney presented me to the Serjeant , who told me , he hop 'd it would be no Inconvenience to me , that the Trial was put off . Mr. Serjeant Hussey , desired Mr. Eustick to go into Court , and inform Mr. Serjeant Eyres that the Cause was put off . He went ; and when he came back to us , he told us , the Cause was brought on , and the Jury were sworn . Upon this I went into Court ; and before I went up to the Bar , I waited a while , in Expectation that my Servant would come , and I intended to have delivered him my Pocket-Book ; but Mr. Eustick pressing me to come within the Bar before my Man came , I took it out of my Waistcoat Pocket , and thrust it down ( square ) into my Breeches Pocket , and button 'd it in . Then I attempted to get thro ' the Crowd , but I met with some Interruption . A lusty Man seem 'd to jostle me , and something , - that lay upon the Ground , rubb 'd against my Shins . I thought it had been a Dog , but I now believe it was a Man , upon his Hands and Knees . I got up to the Bar , and in five or six Minutes Time , the Trial was interrupted for want of Mr. Cantillon ; I ran to call him ; ( 't is hardly a quarter of a Mile from the Hall to his House ) and in coming back , I remember 'd my Pocket-Book , and intended to have left it , at the Upper-End of Basinghall-Street ; I felt for it , but there I found , that one of the Buttons of my Pocket was cut , or twisted off ; the other unbutton 'd , and the Pocket Book was gone . I immediately ran to the Bank to stop Payment ; the Note ( in Question at present ) was for 500 l mark 'd H. No 229 . I had taken a Memorandum of the Notes , upon a bit of Paper , and this 500 l Note was payable to Nat . Bracey ; who sign 'd it , I can not remember ; but the Date was June 2d I walk pretty fast , and I am sure I miss 'd it within a quarter of an Hour after I had button 'd it up in my Pocket . I went no farther than from the Hall to Bartholomew-Lane End . Sampson Solomon . I have known the Prisoner about 7 Weeks , and no longer . About 7 Weeks ago , he gave me the Wink upon Change to follow him ; I went after him into the Passage that goes out of Swithings-Alley into the other Alley . There he told me he had a Bank-Note of 500 l. to dispose off , and said I should speak to some of the Tip-top of our Nation , who had Dealings Abroad , and should tell him if any of them would buy that Note . I said , I do n't doubt but I will help you to a Chap to dispose of it Abroad ; when shall I see you again ? Either To-morrow or next Days says he . He mentioned no Price this first Time of our Meeting . The next Day he met me according to Agreement , and we went to the Black-Swan Tavern in Bartholomew- Lane , where he asked me if I had got him a Chap ? I told him , I had got him a Chap , ( I believed ) who would buy his 500 l. Bank Note , but ( says I ) they are People who are acquainted with the Nature of Advertisements , and they supposed there were more Notes lost with this at the same Time ; I told him likewise , that the Gentleman who was to buy this Note , was desirous of knowing the Number of the Note . I had not spoke to any one about buying this Note , but I thought proper to tell him this , that I might get out of him the Mark and Number of it . Why , says he , I have not the Note about me now , but in a Day or two I will shew it you , and you may give your Friend an Account of it . At the Day appointed we met at the Black-Swan Tavern , and there he shewed me the real Note ; I took Notice of the Number , No . 229. for 500 l. and asked him what he must have for it ? The first Price he set was 300 l. Why , says I , this Note must go Abroad , and there must be prov 'd - Value received ; and all that meddle with it must get by it . Well , says he , I will take no less than 250 l. for it . And what must I have out of this , says I ? You shall have 20 Guineas your self ; so he was to have 229 l. for the 500 l. Note . I made no Words with him , because I never designed to get any Money this Way , else I believe I could have made him promise me 30 Pieces , but I did not design to deal with him all ; I only intended to make what Discovery I could . When I had got the Number out of him , and had seen the Note , I was willing to take Time , so I told him , my Friend was gone to Bristol , and nothing could be done that Week ; this was on the Monday , and I told him he would not be in Town till next Monday , because in that Time I thought I might find out who had advertised the Note ; and I immediately told Aaron Polock of the Affair . ( I forgot to tell the Court that I had asked the Prisoner how long the Note had been in his Possession , and he told me ever since June last , ) I bid Polock find out the Person that had lost the Note , and let me know who it was . Mr. Polock found the Advertisement , and told me that Mr. Weston the Banker , and Mr. Fitzgerald in Basing-hall street wanted to speak with me . I went to Mr. Weston , and told him all that I have related here . This was on the Monday ; Mr. Weston desired me to get the Note , and take the Man ; so I went the next Day to Change , and the Prisoner being there , I shew 'd Polock that was the Man who had the Note , and I order 'd him to walk on the other Side the Change . Then I gave the Prisoner the Wink , and he follow 'd me into the Passage that goes into Will 's Coffee-House ; I told him the Man was come to Town now ; he said he was then going down to Gravesend , but he would meet me on Thursday . He did so , and we went again to the Black-Swan , he asked me if I could get him the Money that Afternoon ? I told him it was not the Time appointed for the Payment of the Money , and the Gentleman was gone out to take a Ride ; but however , his Time ( I said ) should be my Time . Upon this , he appointed the next Day , ( Friday ) for me to bring the Money , and he was to come with the Note upon Change about 10 o'Clock , because ( he said ) there would not be many People there , and he assur 'd me he should have the Note in his Pocket . I had no sooner parted with him , but I went to Mr. Weston and told him I was to meet the Prisoner the next Day ( Friday ) to have the Note from him upon Change ; and that Day he was taken . At this last Meeting , ( Thursday ) I began to be afraid he should suspect me , so I told him , if he car 'd to go with me to the Union Coffee-House , he might ( I believ 'd ) have the Money . No , says he , we 'll refer it till To-morrow , there is so great a Reward upon it , that the Gentleman perhaps may Napp me . I ask 'd him , why he did not go and take this Reward . Ask me no Questions , says he , if you can get me a Chap do ; if it wo n't do for you , 'twill do for some Body else . Counc . Was you present when he was taken ? Solomon . He was taken before I came upon Change . Mr. Polock , to whom I had shewn him , was there , and the Gentleman when they came , being assured by Polock of the Man , they seiz 'd him . I was in the Room when he was search 'd , and he deny 'd that he had ever seen me before . Why , says I , we were together but Yesterday at the Black-Swan , I will not put it upon the Drawer to remember a Thing done many Days ago , but he ca n't have forgot that we had Half a Pint of Sherry , Yesterday . Upon this Mr. Fitzgerald and I went to the Black-Swan , and he asked the Drawer if he should know the Man that came with me Yesterday ? Yes , he said , and when he was brought to the Prisoner , he knew him immediately I was at Guildhall when the Note was taken out of his Book , and the Alderman shewed it me , and I said , that was the Note the Prisoner shewed me before , as sure as there was a God in Heaven . 'T was No . 229. for Five Hundred Pounds . Mr. Smart . This is the Pocket Book that was produced at Guildhall before Mr. Alderman Westley ; I have had it in my Custody ever since , I received it sealed up , but it was opened before Sir Robert Baylis to be shown to Mr. Pye . The Prisoner owned the Pocket Book , but denied the Note that was found in it . There was a good deal of Difficulty in finding it , but at last Mr. Robinson found it artfully enclosed in this Paper , in this Manner . I saw it taken out of the Pocket Book , and there were likewise some small Spring Saws taken out of his Comb-Case , which the Constable has now in Court . Solomon . This is the same Note which the Prisoner shewed me at the Black Swan . Mr. Pye . This is the very Note I lost the 23d of June . Counc . Prof . I think you said you ask 'd the Prisoner how long the Note had been in his Possession . Solomon . Yes , and he said ever since June last . I told him it was not fairly got . No matter for that , says he . I said , you may open the Case to me , I wo n't betray you . Why then , says he , it was bit in Guildhall , without mentioning by whom . I declare nothing but the Truth , as God Almighty loves the Truth , and I am upon my Oath . Aaron Polock . On Friday before the Prisoner was taken Mr. Solomon informed me he was offered a Bank Note of 500 l. No . 299 . I went to the Coffee House and searched the Papers , in one of which I found it advertis 'd . I informed Mr. Weston of the Discovery the Prisoner had made to Mr. Solomon ; and on the Tuesday following Solomon shew 'd me the Prisoner upon 'Change . After this he informed me that he had promised to pay him the Money for the Note on Friday Morning . I acquainted Mr. Weston and Frizgerald of this Agreement , who ordered me proper Assistants upon 'Change , where I shewed them the Prisoner , and would have had them have staid for Mr. Solomon 's coming before they took him , but when they saw him walking off , they would not stay for Solomon , ( as I was positive to the Man ) but followed him into the Passage that goes to Will 's Coffee-House , where they took him , and carried him to the Crown-Tavern ; then they sent for Mr. Weston and Fitzgerald , and the Prisoner was searched , but no Note was found ; however , they carried him to Guildhall , where the Pocket-Book was produc 'd , and the Note found in it , before Alderman Westley . John Giles . I am Drawer at the Black Swan Tavern , and remember , that on Thursday the 20th of April last , I saw the Prisoner and this Man ( Solomon ) there , and drew them Half a Pint of Wine . Richard Lawrence . I am Beadle of the Clothworker 's Company , and was at the taking the Prisoner . We carried him to the Crown Tavern , and when Mr. Weston and Fitzgerald came , we searched him ; he was very ready to pull out his Handkerchief , his Comb-Case and his Money ; I searched his Coat Pockets , but found nothing ; at last I found a private Side-Pocket on this Side of his Coat , and from thence I pulled out this Pocket Book , which I delivered un-opened to Mr. Weston and Fitzgerald ; then I took up the Comb-Case , and observing a Sort of a Flaw towards the Bottom of it , I gave it a Knock , and out came a Steel Saw , upon this I asked Leave to break it open , they told me I might , and upon breaking it open I found three more , and they all seemed to me to be made of Watch Springs . Joseph Mowden . These are the Saws found in the Prisoners Comb-Case . Lawrence . This is the Comb-Case , and these are the Saws which I found in it . Mr. John Weston . I had Information from Mr Polock , that this Bank Note had been offered to Mr. Solomon for Sale ; I told him it was the Property of a Friend of mine at Falmouth , and desired him to do all he could to get it ; he brought Sampson Solomon to me , and I asked him why he did not . seize the Man , when he must needs have apprehended that he had stole it . Lord ! says he , what could I do against so great a Man ! He is as big as Goliah , and as strong as my Namesake . I asked him if he could procure the Note ? No , says he , he is too crafty a Chap . I told him I would assist him , if he would let me have a Sight of the Man , and he promis 'd I should ; he has come two or three Times a Day to tell me what he had done , and the Day before the Prisoner was taken , he was with me twice , and told me he had appointed him to bring the Note the next Morning ( the last of April ) to him upon 'Change , in order to his paying him the Money for it . The next Morning ( Friday ) Polock came to me in a great Hurry , and told me ( about nine o'Clock ) I must come away that Minute , for the Man was then upon the Exchange . I desired him to stay till I put my Shoes on ; then I went with him , and having planted some of my Servants , I asked Polock if he was sure the Prisoner was the Man ? He said he was sure ; upon whidh I was resolv 'd to take him if he should attempt to go off , though Sampson was not yet come . We watched the Space of Half an Hour , and then the Prisoner went off the Exchange ; we followed him , and in the Passage going to Will 's Coffee-House , we took him ; I squeez 'd him hard by the Wrist , therefore he begged I would not use him roughly , and that he might be carried into a House . We carried him to the Crown Tavern , and gave Charge of him to two Constables ; then I ordered my Servants , one on each Side to search the Prisoner 's Hands . He behaved civilly , but we were determined to search him , and Mr. Fitzgerald went to enquire whether we could answer so doing . Upon his Return I bid Lawrence search him ; he ( the Prisoner ) put one Hand into his Pocket , and threw out a Comb-Case , my Man took it up and looked at it ; I asked him if he had not a Pocket Book ? He told me he had ; but my Man , eager in searching , pulled it out himself ; I opened it , and the first Thing I cast my Eye upon was a Note of 45 l. this , says I , is not what I want ; I saw a Piece of Brownish Paper fastened in , but I did not think the Note could have been concealed there , so I laid it down , and the Prisoner took it again and put it into his Pocket . My Man then took up the Comb-Case , and observing something to shine through a small Crack in it , he gave it a knock , and a small Saw came out , upon this we gave him Leave to break it , and found three more . This made us order the Prisoner to deliver his Pocket Book to the Constable , he took it and tied it up , and put it into his Pocket . Councel . Was you by when the Note was found ? Mr. Weston . Yes . At Guildhall Mr. Fitzgerald took the Book from the Constable , and delivered to Mr. Robinson , who found this very Note concealed in the Brown Paper . Joseph Williamson , Constable . This Pocket-Book was delivered to me at the Crown Tavern by the Prisoner ; I tied it up in the Presence of the Company , and delivered it un-opened to Mr. Fitzgerald at Guildhall , he delivered it to Mr. Robinson , who found the Note in it . Mr. Fitzgerald confirmed the former Witnesses , and proved the Note produced in Court , was the same which was found at Guildhall in the Pocket Book . Mr. Robinson . When the Prisoner was examined at Guildhall , Mr. Fitzgerald delivered the Pocket Book to me , and some Account being given of the artful Concealment of the Saws , I imagined it might be proper to search the Pocket Book more carefully ; I therefore untied it , and the Prisoner said , if there was any Bank Note in it , it was not put there by him . I searched the Book carefully , and found this Note , folded up in this Manner . The NOTE . For the Governor and Company of the Bank of England . No . H. 229 . I promise to pay to Nat . Bracey , Esq ; and Company , or Bearer , on Demand , the Sum of Five Hundred Pounds . London , June 2 , 1737 . 500 l. Daniel Race . Enter 'd E. Shenian . Mr. Ralph Morrison and Mr. Race , proved the Signing the Note . DEFENCE . Prisoner . The Night before I was taken I came from Gravesend , and got to a Friend 's House about One o'Clock ; about 7 in the Morning I got up , in order to find out a Man that owed me 45 l. I went upon 'Change between 9 and 10 to wait for him , and sat down upon a Bench ; after I had sat some Time , I went out into the Passage to make Water , and they came and seiz 'd me , they would not tell me what I was seiz 'd for ; I said , I hop 'd it was not for Murder ; no , said they , 't was for something worse , for we have got a Jew to swear against you . As I use the Holland Trade , I might have put this Note off myself . 'T is very odd that I should wink at a Jew , - a Stranger , - a Fellow that I never saw in my Life , to consult with upon this Affair . As to the Saws , the Man tool the Comb Case and turned himself to the Window , and then said he had taken them out of the Comb Case . Councel . To Mr. Pye . Was this Note ever satisfy 'd ? Mr. Pye . No , it has never been paid . Prisoner . 'T is a little odd , that I should offer this Note to a Fellow all in Rags ; for as I have Dealing over Sea , I had no need to undervalue it . Coin sent out of the Kingdom , I know is seizable , but a Bank Note I could easily have sent abroad . That Man ( Lawrence ) came to see me in Newgate , and brought me two Pieces of Beef , and a Piece of Bread , and told me he believ 'd the Jew was the greatest Rogue of the two . Mr. Lawrence . I did carry him some Bread and roast Beef , and treated him with a Pot of Beer , because he was very poor ; but so far from saying , the Jew was the greatest Rogue , I then told him , that I verily believed he was the Man that pick 'd Mr. Pye 's Pocket , and he cry 'd about it most heartily . Humphry Ingram gave an Account that the Prisoner used to live at his House , in Bell Alley , Goswell-Street ; that the 21st of April he came thither about one o'Clock in the Morning ; that he had known him ten Years , and had an honest Character , as far as he knew . Elizabeth Price had known him about 12 or 13 Years ; that his Business was selling Hollands , Lace , Muslin , & c. and that he bore an honest Character . Philip Collins depos 'd to the same Effect . Thomas Loftos did not know him personally , but he had made Perukes for him , and he had been paid for them . Matthew Leman , William Blincoe , Francis Kelham , and Sarah Redhead , had known him , different Numbers of Years , and took him to be an honest Man . Samuel Thompson likewise declared , that he had known the Prisoner ever since he was 18 or 19 Years old , from his frequenting the Streets of London . That he went by the Name of Joseph Johnson , and that from a Lad he had been accounted a Pick-pocket . He farther said , that about the Time this Note was lost , he met the Prisoner and another Man coming out the back Way , as from Guildhall ; that they went towards London-Wall , and that hearing in a publick House , the next Morning , that a Gentleman had lost such Notes in Guildhall , he then said publickly , he believ 'd he knew who robb 'd him ; and that his general Character for 24 or 25 Years past , has been that of a Pick-pocket . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 13.

Thomas Cross , was indicted , for that he being a Person of a wicked and corrupt Mind , greedy of Lucre , & c. and unlawfully contriving and intending to cheat and defraud Benjamin Hoare , Henry Hoare , Richard Hoare , and Christopher Arnold , of a great Sum of Money , viz . 75 l. in Portugal Money , value 75 l. and to get and acquire to himself the said Sum of 75 l. the said Messieurs Hoare and Arnold , being then concern 'd in Partnership , in the Banking Business , and keeping Cash , and also then keeping a publick Shop ; on the 26th of Jan. in the Parish of St. Dunstan in the West , he the said Car , out of his wicked Mind , Intention , & c. made and forged , and caused to be made and forg 'd , in the Name of William Payne , a certain Paper in writing , purporting a Note , Order , Power or Authority , in the Name of the said Payne , for Payment of Money , bearing Date , Jan. 12 , 1737 . and directed to Messieurs Hoare and Company , in Fleetstreet , and authorizing them the said Benjamin Hoare , and Richard Hoare , and Christopher Arnold , under the Denomination of Messieurs Hoare and Company , to pay to Abram Irons , or Berer ( meaning Bearer ) the said Sum of 75 l. which said false and forged Order , is contain 'd in the Words and Figures following . Jan. 12 , 1737 . Pray Pay to Mr. Abram Irons , or Berer , the Sum of Seventy five Pounds , and place the same to the Account of your Humble Servant , William Payne . P. S. 75 l. Portugal Money . Thereby meaning and intending , that they the said Benjamin , Henry , and Richard Hoare , and Christopher Arnold , should pay him the said Cross , the said Sum of 75 l. Whereas in Truth and Fact , the said Paper or Writing was never signed by the said William Payne , & c. against the Peace , & c. to the evil Example of others , & c. in Contempt of our Lord the King , and his Laws , and against the Form of the Stature , & c. 2 . The Jurors farther present , that Tho Cross being a Person of a wicked and corrupt Disposition , and unjustly contriving , & c. to cheat and defraud Benjamin Richard , and Henry Hoare , and Christopher Arnold , of another great Sum of Money , viz . 75 l. in Portugal Money , and to get and acquire the same to himself , on the 26th of Jan & c. out of his wicked Mind , assisted in making , and forging in the Name of William Payne , a certain Note and Writing , purporting in it self an Order , & c. under the Hand of William Payne , bearing Date and directed , & c. ( as above ) & c. & c. 3 . The Jurors farther present , that he the said Cross , being a Person of a wicked and corrupt Mind , & c. ( as above ) and wickedly intending to cheat and defraud Messrs. Hoare and Arnold , of another great Sum of Money , viz 75 l. in Portugal Money , and to get and acquire the same to himself , on the 26th of Jan. in the Parish and Ward aforesaid , did utter and publish a Paper in Writing , purporting in it self , an Order , & c. under the Hand of William Payne , & c. & c. Mr. Atkinson . On Tuesday the 10th of Jan. 1737 . Mr. Payne paid into our Shop 340 l. I receiv 'd the Money from the Prisoner at the Bar , in Mr. Payne 's Presence . I am Clerk to Messrs. Benjamin , Henry , and Richard Hoare , and Christopher Arnold , who is in Partnership with Messrs Hoare . I gave Mr. Payne a Note for this Money that he might draw it out again . By vertue of this forged Note , 74l . was paid to Richard Car , who told me , when I paid him , that he liv 'd in Covent-Garden , I know Mr. Payne 's Hand , and am positive this is not his Writing ; I have seen him often write , and when the Prisoner came with him and paid me this 340 l. I got Mr. Payne to write his Name in our Book , and the Prisoner stood over him while he did it . Prisoner . I desire Mr. Atkinson may be asked , whether Mr. Payne was not to fetch the whole Sum away again ? And whether he was not told that he must not draw for it in small Sums ? Mr. Atkinson . He was not forbid drawing for it in small Sums ; I told him if he drew for it , he must draw for Portugal Money , he said , he should not have Occasion for it this Month or two , and that he should draw for it when he wanted it . Prisoner . I would ask whether he did not give Mr. Payne an actual Promissory Note for this 340 l. for Value receiv 'd ? Mr. Atkinson . 'T is a common Thing in the Course of our Business to give Notes drawn on one 's self , - I promise to pay to William Payne , & c. for Value receiv 'd . Prisoner . Is Mr. Atkinson positive that I saw Mr. Payne write his Name in the Book ? Mr. Atkinson . Yes , and the Prisoner look 'd at the Book while I was making the Note for Mr. Payne . Prisoner . Did any one else hear Mr. Payne say he should draw for it as he wanted it . Mr. Atkinson . I do n't know . We have two other Clerks in the Shop , - they might , - or they might not . John Crull . I know Mr. Payne 's Hand ; the Name at the Bottom of this Note ( looking upon it ) is a Counterfeit ; and for a Counterfeit , 't is the worst I ever saw in my Life . Mr. Parker . I know Mr. Payne 's Writing ; this is not like it . Robert Ramsay . I know the Prisoner very well . The first Time I ever saw this Note was on Thursday the 26th of Jan. last . On that Thursday Morning , Car ( who was try 'd last Night for this Fact ) and I , met according to Appointment in Guildhall . As we were walking on one Side of the Hall , we met the Prisoner and one Sands . After we had talked together for some Time , the Prisoner drew this Note out of his Pocket , and said if you 'll undertake to receive this Note , I can draw for Thousands upon others . I said it would be hazardous and dang'rous , and that I did not Care to undertake it . We consulted together about it , and at last it was agreed that Car and I should go to the Chevalier 's Billiard Table in Moorfields , and we were to Play . While we were at Play the Prisoner was to come in as a Stranger , and was to challenge Car ; they two were to play 'till the Prisoner had lost a certain Sum to Car ; then he was to offer Car the Note , and to tell him he might go and receive that Note , and he would pay him what he had lost . The Reason of this Proceeding was , that if Car should be detected when he went with the Note , or should be call 'd in Question about it , the Woman who keeps the Billiard Table should be a Witness for him . According to our Agreement , Car and I went that Day to the Billiard Table and play 'd : In some little Time , the Prisoner and his Friend Sands follow 'd us , and he , ( the Prisoner ) challenged Car to play ; in about an Hour Car won 30 l. of the Prisoner , and then Car demanding the Money he had won of the Prisoner , he threw down this Note , telling him he had not Money enough about him to pay him , but he might take that Note upon Mr. Hoare , and he might go and receive it , and might pay himself . Car told the Prisoner it was Dinner Time ; however , if he would go to the Three Tuns in New-Street , Fetter-Lane , and take a Dinner , he would go when he had din 'd . Upon this , the Prisoner , I , Car , and Sands , went to the Three Tuns , and called for a Room , and ( I think ) we had Part of a Fillet of Veal for Dinner : Before we had half din 'd , the Prisoner seemed uneasy , upon which Car said , - give me the Note , - I 'll go , and Fortune be my Guide . The Prisoner gave him the Note , and he immediately went out with it ; Sands followed him at a Distance , and if he should be stopped , he was to have come back and given us Intelligence that we might have made off . The Prisoner and I waited for Car 's Return some little Time , then I began to be uneasy , so I went down to the Door where I met Car ; he was come back , and told us the Business was done , the Note would be paid , only it wanted a little Thing , - called an Endorsement , and when that was done it would be paid . With Persuasion I wrote on the Back of the Note , - Abram Irons . Then Car took the Note and went with it again Sands , followed him at a Distance , I followed Sands and the Prisoner followed me ; but before we got near Mr. Hoare 's , Car was come out with the Money in his Handkerchief ; upon this we went back to the Three Tuns , where Cross ( the Prisoner ) told Car he had made a Blunder , for he had brought but 74 l. instead of 75 . Upon dividing the Money , a Dispute arose whether we should all be equal Sharers , and the Prisoner insisted upon it , that as we were all equally concerned , we should all be equal Sharers . Councel . When the Prisoner first produced this Note , did he do it as a real or a forged Note ? Ramsey . He produced it as a forged Note , and told us he had paid Money in at Mr. Hoare 's for Mr. Payne some Time before , but he did not mention the particular Time . Out of the Money received , we had each of us Five Three Pound Twelve Pieces , and some small Money , and the Prisoner had his Share . Prisoner . I desire he might be asked how long he has known me ? Ramsey . I have been acquainted with him about ten Months ; but the Time we all met at Guildhall , was in the Morning , Thursday the 26th of January last , as near as I can remember ; I believe I may be very positive to that Day . Councel . Have you had any Conversation with the Prisoner since the Note was found to be forged ? Ramsey . Yes ; I met him at a Place called Eastham Boathouse , over against Liverpoole , and he told me he flew for fear any Accident should happen ; he was afraid of Car ( he said ) more than of me . He did not know at that Time that he was described in the Advertisements , but I told him ( at that Meeting ) he was put in the Papers . Prisoner . Ask him why he left London with Car under Disguises . Ramsey . Because we were afraid of being taken for this Forgery . Prisoner . Ask him if he did not abscond on Account of another Note of 125 l. which they sent to Mr. Hoare 's , and the Messenger was detected ? Ramsey . I was concerned in the 125 l. Note , and Car who carried it was stopped , but I did not forge any of them , nor did I fly immediately ; I did not abscond till Advertisements were put in the Papers concerning Mr. Hoare 's being defrauded of 212 l. Mrs. Smith . I keep the Billiard Table ( he mentions ) I know both the Prisoner and the Evidence Ramsey ; I saw them together at my House some Time in January , but I ca n't remember the particular Day . Mr . Car was there likewise at the same Time . Prisoner . Please to ask Mrs. Smith , whether Car 's Sister did not come with her to see me in the Counter ? And whether Car 's Sister did not point to me and tell her , I was the Person that was to save her Brother ? Smith . Car 's Sister was with me there , and she said , - Mr. Cross , this is the Gentlewoman that is to save my Brother 's Life ; but I knew the Prisoner before she said this . Prisoner . What Cloaths had I on when I was at your Billiard Table ? Smith . A Blue Grey Coat , and a dark short Whig , to the best of my Remembrance , but I ca n't remember the Day of the Week , nor the Day of the Month . Prisoner . Mr. Atkinson has sworn to Mr. Paine 's Hand , and that he knows this was not his Writing . I desire he may be ask 'd , how he came to be deceiv 'd , and to pay this Note ? Mr. Atkinson . I was in a Hurry , and had 8 or 10 People about me , and I do n't remember that I compar 'd the Hand with Mr. Payne 's Name in our Book . I had given a Note for 340 l. to be drawn out , and I thought I might safely pay a Draught of 75 l. Edward Cotterel . I live at the Three Tuns in New Street ; I have seen the Prisoner 's Face , and I think I remember the Witness Ramsey and he were together at our House about four Months ago ; there was four or five of them together , and I think they had Part of a Fillet of Veal . They came in about Eleven o'Clock in the Forenoon , and staid some Time , then they went out and came in again ; they seem 'd ( all of them ) to be in a Fluster , and I was afraid of losing the Silver Tankard and the Spoons which they had at the Table ; I imagined they intended to steal the Plate , therefore I desired my Mistress to take Care of her Plate , for they went backwards and forwards and seem 'd so fluster 'd , that I did not like them . Two or three of them went out , and returned in a Quarter of an Hour . - I very much disliked their Behaviour , I remember . Mary Macey . I remember something of both their Faces , and that Cotterel told my Mistress he believed the Tankard and the Spoons were in Danger ; he desired her to take Care of the Plate they were using ; he attended them , and told her he did not like his Company , they seemed to be so uneasy . I remember this was in Jan. last . Robert Patterson . I know the Prisoner , and Ramsey , and Car . Ramsey and Cross the Prisoner I know are acquainted , but I ca n't say much to the Acquaintance between them and Car . I have been in Company with Ramsey and the Prisoner several Times about five or six Months ago , they were then young Acquaintances ; I have not known any of them long , but at that Time I used to be often in their Company . Prisoner . Mr. Patterson is a Judge of the Game at Billiards , ask him if ever he saw me play at Billiards for any Money ? Patterson . He was always unwilling to play for Money . [ The Note was read . ] Pray pay Mr. Abram Irons , or Berer ( Bearer ) the Sum of 75 l. ( in Figures ) and Place the same to Account of Your Humble Servant , William Payne . To Mess . Hoare and Comp . in Fleet-Street . To be paid in Portugal Money . Endors 'd , Abram Irons . The Councel for the Prisoner observ 'd , ( on a Point of Law ) that the Charge in the Indictment was laid for 75 l. Portugal Money , value 75 l. English . The Objection was , that the Note read in Evidence , was not agreeable to the Indictment . That it appear 'd the Note under Consideration was payable in Portugal Money , which is not the current Money of this Kingdom . That the Indictment therefore was defective . And that it ought to have charg 'd , - that the Defendant intended and design 'd to have defrauded Messieurs Hoare and Company of so many Pieces of Portugal Money , value so much : But the Indictment charges the Defendant plainly , with defrauding Messieurs Hoare and Company of 75 l. which must be understood , 75 l. current Coin ; whereas , the Sum of 75 l. could not be paid in Portugal Money ; no Pieces of that Coin making exactly that Sum . The Councel for the Prosecution observ 'd , that it was no Wonder a sinking Man caught hold of every Twig . That the Words of the Statute were , - if any Person should forge a Note , or Order , for Payment of MONEY , or Delivery of Goods , with Intent to defraud , & c. That Money is Money , tho ' not the current Money of this Kingdom , and that the Word in the Act , was Money , generally . That it was plain , the Act made it a Crime to forge a Warrant , for the Payment of Money , ( generally . ) That Portugal Coin , was Money , ( and the Value was right in the Indictment , ) - therefore , the Indictment charged the Defendant , according to the Act , and the Evidence had sufficiently supported the Indictment . The Councel observ 'd further , that it was impossible to have laid it , in any other Manner ; for it must have been laid for either Money , or Goods ; and that Portugal Money could not be consider 'd as Goods , was evident ; because no one could say , - Pray pay Goods . Therefore , it must be consider 'd as Money . Mr. Atkinson . But I did not pay all the Sum in Portugal Money , there were 4 Shillings in Silver . It was farther observ 'd , that a former Act calls it foreign Coin ; that Coin is Money , not Bullion . That the Cheat was the same if in Portugal Money , or British Money , and that when these Pieces were exported , they were consider 'd as Money , or Coin , not as Goods . That there was another Act , which restrain 'd People from counterfeiting the foreign Coins , which pass in this Kingdom , in these Words , - viz . Be it enacted , & c. that if any Person shall forge or counterfeit any such Coins , as are not the proper Coins of this Kingdom , but permitted to be current , they shall be judged guilty of High-Treason ; and They , their Abettors , Assistants , & c. being convict , shall forfeit , & c. as in Case of High-Treason . Prisoner . I shall call Witnesses to prove , that from the 20th of January , to February , I was out of Town . Richard Davis . But I ca n't be positive to the Day . I think it was about the latter End of January . I went into Wooburn , in Bedfordshire , in January , I think 't was the latter End of the Month , and he was there very ill , and had a Doctor and a Nurse . I am his Taylor , and work for him . Councel . Has the Prisoner paid you any Money since January ? Davis . Let me see , - yes , he paid me for making a Coat and Breeches , since that Time , - 't was at Chester he paid me , - I ca n't remember the Time . Counc . What Coin did he pay you in ? Davis . In Silver . Mr. Ford . The Prisoner calls me to shew , ( I suppose ) that on the 10th of January last , I had one Thousand Pounds paid to me , as a Trustee , for some particular Uses , by Mr. De la Hay in the City : and that I then had that Confidence in him , that I trusted him with a Bank Note of 500 l. to carry to Mr. Hoare , and exchange for a 400 l. Note , and a 100 l. Bank Bill . I did trust him , and 't was this induced Mr. Payne to entrust him . The Prisoner liv 'd with me about eleven Months , and during that Time I had no Reason to suspect him . He has left me now , and I will not impeach his Character . If I have Suspicions , they are out of the Case . Councel . Do you believe him to have been a faithful Servant to you ? Mr. Ford . I have given him Money , while he was with me , to pay for Stamps ; and since he left me , I have had a Bill brought in for them . He went away from me the 18th of January , on Account of the many Actions depending against him for Debt ; he being disappointed of Money he expected to have received . I do n't know where he has been since he left me . Henry Davis . About the Middle of January last , the Prisoner had the Misfortune to be arrested for 5.l was carry 'd to a Spunging-House in Grocer 's Alley . He sent for me thither , and I found Car and Ramsey with him . Among other Discourse , the Prisoner was mentioning what a large Sum he had been entrusted with the Day before , of Mr. Payne 's , all in Portugal Money . Ramsey told him he was a Fool he did not run away with it . The Prisoner reply 'd , he would not forfeit his Character for ten times that Sum . Patridge , Keeper of Chester Goal . About 6 Weeks ago the Prisoner was in my Custody , and behav 'd well . Ramsey and Car I saw at Liverpool , they broke Gaol on Friday Night , and were taken again on Saturday Night . - Darnburgh . Ramsey , Peterson , Cross , and one Rosamond , with several of their Acquaintance , frequented my House in Arundel-Street . I never saw Car with them but once , and that was the Time the Advertisement came out , and he was in Fear I should take him . I never heard any Ill of them , 'till after Cross was gone out of Town . - Smallwood . I know nothing of this Affair concerning the Note ; but I know Cross , he was some Time under my Care . I have had a liberal Education , and was brought up at the University , so I teach a School ; and during the Time the Prisoner was with me , I look 'd on him to be so honest , that I recommended him to Mr. Ford . Mr. Cecil . I knew the Prisoner when he liv 'd with Mr. Pitt as a Footman , and the Family I believe always thought well of him , he liv 'd with him about four Years ago . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty of the Indictment . Death . 19. Richard Car , was indicted ( in the same manner as above ) for the same Fact , the Evidence against him was the same as in the foregoing Trial , and the Point of Law observ 'd upon , was likewise the same . His Trial came on the Day before Cross 's , and the Jury brought in their Verdict Special . The found the Facts as follows . That Richard Car on the 26th of Jan. last , utter 'd and publish 'd as true , the forged Note , set forth in the last Count in the Indictment , with Intent to deceive Messrs. Hoare and Arnold , of 75 l. That at that Time of uttering and publishing the same , he knew it to be false and counterfeit . That he , the said Car , by Vertue of that counterfeit Note , did receive of William Atkinson , then Servant to Mr. Hoar and Comp . the Sum of 75 l. being the Money of Messrs. Hoare and Arnold . That 73 l. 16 s. Part of the said Sum , was paid him in Portugal Coin , and the remaining 4 s. in current and lawful Money of Great-Britain , referring Points of Law to the Judgment of the Court . 20. John Brown , was indicted for stealing a Steel Hand-saw , value 4 s. and a Pannel Saw , value 4 s. the Goods of Isaac Bullock , April 17 Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 21. Samuel Walker , was indicted for stealing a Cloth Coat , value 1 s. a pair of Shoes , value 5 s. a silk Handkerchief , value 2 s. 4 Silk and Muslin ditto , value 3 s. and other Things , the Goods of Rowland Jones , and others , May 12 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 22. Richard Sanders , was indicted for stealing 11 Pewter Plates , value 6 s. and 3 Pewter Dishes , value 5 s. the Goods of John Malard , May 18 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 23. John Wisdell , and John Temple , were indicted for assaulting James Little in a certain Field and open Place call 'd Constitution-Hill , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Silver Watch , value 40 s. a Guinea , and 24 s. in Money , Jan. 2 . * Wisdell was convicted for Transportation last Sessions , for stealing a great Parcel of Linnen from a Laundress at Kensington . James Little . A little after 9 at Night , May the 7th , I was going up Constitution Hill , and a Man turn 'd short upon me , and said he wanted some Money . What then , says I , D - mn your Blood says he , I must have your Money , O ! says I , I understand you now ; and immediately another Man came up and cry 'd , - D - mn him , drag him into the Grass , - stab him , or shoot him . They then dragg 'd me into the Grass , and took from me a Silver Watch , a Guinea , and about 22 or 23 s. and some Half-pence . I gave them good Words , and desired they would not use me ill ; then they demanded my Watch , and the String being broke , they compell 'd me to take it out my self . They took my Money themselves , one of them rifled my Pockets on one Side , and the other those on the other Side . When they had done with me , they ran down the Hill towards St. James's-Park , bidding me Good-night , and I return 'd their Complement . It was very dark , so I could not observe their Faces , so as to be able to swear to them , but I have great Reason to believe that Wisdell was the Man who was for stabbing or shooting me , because he confessed it in Newgate , and I remember they were both tall Men in Soldier 's Cloaths . It being known that I had been robb 'd by such Men , the Officers of the Guards sent for me next Morning , and when the Guard was reliev 'd , they placed me where I might see the Men , and if I had known the Persons that robb 'd me , they would have secur 'd them ; but I could not swear to any of their Faces . Some Time afterwards , I found the Watch in the Custody of one Burroughs , a Grenadier , and had it restored to me again . This is the Watch , and this is the Seal , but the Key has been mended while it has been out of my Possession . I went to Newgate just before the Beginning of last Sessions with Justice Blackerby 's Clerk , and saw the Prisoner Wisdell ; he confessed that he and one Wheatley robbed me of such and such Things , mentioning every particular Thing that I lost . I know nothing of the other Prisoner , ( Temple ) only he was the Man that sold my Watch to Burroughs . Wisdell has confessed the Fact to almost twenty People , and upon this Arraignment ( as I am informed ) he pleaded Guilty , but immediately retracting his Plea , he put himself upon his Trial . - Burroughs . The Prisoner Temple told me he had a Watch of a Countryman of his to dispose of , and it would be a cheap Bargain ; and in about a Week after he came with Wisdell , and he ( Temple ) shewed me the Watch , and asked me 50 s. for it ; I bid him two Guineas , and after some Consideration between him and Wisdell , Temple delivered me the Watch , and Wisdell took the Money ; I paid 1 l. 13 s. in Part of the two Guineas ; but some Time afterwards Temple came to me , and told me he would not have me pay any more Money upon it , for he believed it was not honestly come by . I desired they would return the Money and take the Watch again ; they promised me they would , but they never did . Elisha Turner , Serjeant . Temple offered to sell me this Seal , I refused to buy it of him , but I afterwards bought it for Half a Crown of Corporal Raymond ; Temple had 18 d. of the Money : Temple when he first offered it me , told me he had found it in St. James's-Court ; I kept it three or four Days , then thinking it was not honestly come by , I went to Raymond and demanded my Money again , upon which Temple threw me my Half Crown and took the Seal again . Temple . I was at Home and a-bed when this Fact was committed . James Moreton .

Mr. Lewis . I do n't know the Prisoner : I was robb 'd the 27th of August , 1736 , and Wager and Baker were hang 'd for it . I was coming from Bedfordshire , and in the watery Lane , near Kentish Town , I met four Men on Horseback , they cry 'd Hey ! and I cry 'd Hallo ! I rode on a little Way , and one of them turn 'd short on my Horse 's Hips . I ask 'd him , what he did that for ? He immediately whipp 'd by me , and demanded my Money . I told him he should have what I had got , but I desired him not to meddle with the Lady that was with me . He said he would not . Then I pull 'd out about 13 s. three Copper Pieces , and the Copper Ticket , and gave them ; but the Man that was behind said , I must be search 'd ; and he put his Hand into this Pocket , and took out five Guineas , and two half Guineas . This is the Ticket they took from me at that Time . One of them took hold of my Horse 's Bridle , and told me , if I had a Bushel of Arms , they would signify nothing . 'T was the Man that I gave the Money too , who search 'd me , and pull 'd out the Gold , a Key , and a Nutmeg . He felt about my Breeches for a Watch , but I assured him I had none , and began to swear at them ; but a Man behind , bid me not swear so , for I should not be ill us 'd , and he bid the rest of the Gang come away , if they had got what they could . D - mn it , says another of them , he never rides without a Watch ; I assur 'd them I had none , so they then rode away , to another Man , who belonged to my Company , and stood under a Tree , with some Venison behind him , his Mare would not stand . One of them cry 'd , D - mn it , shoot him if he wo n't stand . I said do n't shoot him , let my Horse 's Nose come up to the Mare 's , and she 'll stand . That Gentleman 's Name was Walker , but he has been dead about 5 or 6 Weeks . They took about 10 or 12 Shillings from him , and wish 'd us a good Night ; telling me , they hop 'd when it was in my Power , I would use them , as well as they had used me . I ca n't say I know the Prisoner ; 'twould be a vile Thing in me to swear the Man 's Life away , when I know nothing of him . I remember the Evidence , for by the Light which came over the Bank , I saw his Face plainly . Stephen Horsenail . I can not deny but the Prisoner was concerned with us in this Robbery . He was present when Mr. Lewis was robb 'd , and assisted in the Robbery , but he took nothing from him . Baker , Wager , the Prisoner and I , set out from Ralph Guy 's , at the White-Lion at Hornsey , with Intent to rob any Body we should meet . About 8 o'Clock we met Mr. Lewis , and a Lady , and a Gentleman following them , in the Lane that goes to Kentish Town . We rid past him , and the rest of his Company , then Baker turn 'd back , and said there was our Mark ; I came up with Mr. Lewis , and my Horse 's Head lay upon his Horse 's Buttock I took from him what I could find , but Baker insisted on searching him farther , and had it not been for the unhappy Man at the Bar , and myself , he would have done him a Mischief . I search 'd him , and took to the Value of 6 l. from him . The Prisoner was behind Mr. Lewis , and was to give us Notice of any Surprize . One Mr Walker was robb 'd at the same Time : Baker and Wager insisted upon robbing the Lady , but Mr. Lewis persuaded us from it , because her Horse was startish . After we had committed this Fact , we went to Ralph Guy 's in Hornsey-Lane , and shar 'd the Money we had got that Night , which came to about 50 s. a Man ; the Prisoner was present , and I believe had his Share ; but he was tired of such a Way of Life , and soon went quite away from the Company , in about a Week 's Time . I was apprehended about the Beginning of October , on Account of a Fact that I was not guilty of ; I begun to be weary of such Courses , and therefore made a voluntary Confession . I have heard that the Prisoner has been in an Employment ever since he absconded . I saw him ( just before he went down to Bristol ) about 10 or 11 Weeks ago , in Wood 's Close . We are both sorry for our past Follies , and I know he would be glad to receive Favour , as well as I . Our Conversation was on the Hardships , that the unfortunate Man at the Bar had sustain 'd , by his being obliged to wander backward and forward , when he should be glad to settle to any Labour . How he came to be discover 'd , I do n't know ; - I did not betray him . I have nothing more to say , and am sorry that I am able , and am obliged to say so much . ( Weeping . ) Joseph Barnes William Horsenail , the Evidence , was first taken , I was an Officer : He was taken up for a Fact that he was not guilty of ; but he told me he was indeed engag 'd in a bad Way of Life ; that he was glad he was taken , for now he would make a voluntary Discovery . He confess 'd this Fact before Justice Mitford , and put the Prisoner , and Wager , and Baker , into his Information . I got a Warrant to apprehend them all three ; but the Prisoner fled . I kept the Warrant by me ; and hearing of his being at Bristol , I went down with this Man ( Thomas Macklin ) and took him . We took him as he came from Work , and as far as I can hear , he had work 'd very hard , and maintain 'd himself honestly , all the while he had been there . We should have had another Witness here , - Ralph Guy , - he promised to be here ; he was here on Wager and Baker 's Trial , but he was an unwilling Witness then , and now he has sent a Boy here , who I suppose is to swear he is sick . I must say , the Prisoner has led an honest , careful Life , ever since he got rid of his Companions . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . He was a second Time indicted for assaulting Thomas Bullmore on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a silver Watch and Chain , value 50 s. a Steel Seal , value 6 d. and 16 s. in Money , Aug. 26 , 1736 The Evidence was the same as appear 'd on the Trials of Wager and Baker , 1736 , the Prisoner chose rather to throw himself on the Mercy of the Court , than to give Trouble ; and Mr. Barnes , who fetch 'd him from Bristol , declared that he was sure he work 'd for his Living there ; for when he took him up , his Masters appear 'd for him . Guilty . Death . 35. Nathan Cockran , of St. Luke 's , Middlesex , was indicted for stealing 22 Dozen of Silk Loopes , value 50 s. eight Gross of white Thread ditto , value 7 l. one lb of Thread , value 5 s. 9 d. a Linnen Apron , value 4 d. and two Bandboxes , value 6 d. the Goods of Henry Turland , in his Dwelling-House , March 25 . Henry Turland I have nothing to say , but that the Goods were my Property , and were stole out of my House in Noble-street , on the 25th of March . There was about 22 Dozen of Silk Loopes , and 8 Gross of Thread Loopes , a Pound of Thread , a Check Apron , and two Bandboxes . I saw them all in the back Room below Stairs , on Saturday the 25th of March , and on Monday following , we miss 'd them . Upon Enquiry , I found that this Witness ( Elizabeth Haydon ) knew something of the Affair , so I had her before Mr. Justice Polson , and she discover 'd the Prisoner and his Wife . Thro ' her Means we took him ; and we found some of the Goods at Mr. Compton 's ot the White-Hart in Pater-noster-row , 12 or 13 Dozen of them were sold there . When Cockran was taken up , he own 'd he had had the Goods , but he told us , he had them from one Bolingbroke and his Wife . Two Gross he said were pawn 'd , he could not tell where , and the rest he deliver 'd to Eliz . Haydon to dispose of for him . Part of the Goods which were found in Pater noster-row , were carry 'd before my Lord-Mayor , and were put into the Hands of Nettlefold the Constable . Elizabeth Haydon . The Prisoner sent for me on the Thursday before Good-Friday to his Lodging ; I went up Stairs , and he shew 'd me a great quantity of Silk and thread Loopes . There were 16 dozen of Silk Loopes , and 6 gross and better of thread Loopes . He told me if I would dispose of them for him , he would satisfy me for my Trouble . I saw no Banboxes , nor any check Apron . I ask 'd him whose they were ? He said they were his own , and he ty 'd them up in a Handkerchief , and his Wife and I went to Mr. Crouch 's Shop , ( he is dead , and Mr. Compton keeps it now ) Mr Compton would not have bought them if he had not known me . He knew me , and bought 12 or 13 Dozen of Silk and Thread Loopes together , and the Prisoner had the Money . 'T was either 14 or 15 s. that we had for them , I ca n't tell which . I told him I never did sell such Goods for the Money , but having Cockran 's Consent , I took the Money and gave it to him , at the Post-Boy in Black-Fryar 's . After this , I sold 6 Dozen to one Mr. Plummer in the Borrough for 6 s. Tee Prisoner 's Wife and he were both at the Door , the same Time . This Money I likewise deliver 'd to the Prisoner , and he gave me 3 s. 6 d. for my Trouble . Prisoner . I desire she may be asked , whether one Mrs. Deal , did not deliver her the Goods at 1 s. per Dozen ? Haydon . I do n't know Mrs. Deal , nor did I ever see her in my Life , as I know of . Prisoner . Was not Mr. Deal and his Wife in the Room when she was there , and took the Loopes to dispose of ? Haydon . No , there was none in the Room but the Prisoner . Eliz . Turland . I saw about 6 Dozen of the same Goods I had lost in Mr. Compton 's Shop in Pater-noster row . We gave him Notice to be here Yesterday ; but I have not seen him here to Day . Mr. Compton own 'd before my Lord-Mayor , that he bought them of 2 Women , one of whom , he knew to be a Loop-maker upon Clerkenwell-Green , but he said he could not tell where to find her . I saw only Thread Loopes at his Shop , but he said he had bought 2 Dozen of Silk Coat Loopes among them , at 2 s per Dozen , when a Crown a Dozen is my Market Price . My Lord granted me his Warrant to bring Mr. Compton before him , and he order 'd him to let the Constable have the Goods . I saw them , and they were part of the Goods I lost . Mr. Compton said he did not know the Value of them . My Lord-Mayor granted me a Warrant for Mr. Plummer in the Borough , but he refused to let me have my Goods , unless I would pay him 12 s. tho ' I saw them at his Shop , and he gave but 6 s. for them . Mr. Turland . Mr. Justice Engier told me I must return Mr. Plummer 12 s. then I might take my Goods . Mr. Plummer and his Wife said , they bought them of 2 Women who had a great deal of Work , and that they might have bought much more ; and Mrs. Plummer told her Husband she had a Notion that they were 2 loose Creatures , of whom he bought this Work , and she seem 'd to be frighted . Mr. Plummer lives at the 3 Kings on the other Side of the Bridge . Prisoner . I had the Goods of one Deal and his Wife ; and Haydon saw me deliver the Money she gave me to Deal and his Wife , at the Post Boy , and they gave her 6 s. Haydon . I never changed a Word with any one but the Prisoner upon this Affair ; nor had I any Money but what he gave me . Cockran . Here 's the Prisoner who heard Haydon say , she would swear my Life away for a full Pot of Beer . Tho James , a Prisoner . I am in Custody for taking a Handkerchief . I heard Haydon say , she had the Loopes to dispose of from Cockran 's House . I heard nothing more Guilty , 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 34.

Arthur O'Hara and William Tobin , of St. George 's Hannover-Square , were indicted with Rose Plunkett ( not taken ) for assaulting Thomas Claridge on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him , a Silver Watch , two brass Seals , and a brass Key , value 5 l. a silk Handkerchief , value 6 d. and five Shillings in Money , April 28 . Mr. Claridge . I was going to my Master 's Stables , on the 28th of April , about 10 at Night , and under the Duke of Devorshire 's Wall , I was attack 'd by two Men and a Woman One of the Men put a Knife to my Breast , and said , If I offer 'd to disturb them , they would stab me . Then the Woman came up while they held me , and took my Watch , 5 s. and a Handkerchief . When she had robb 'd me , one of the Men still held me , while his Companion and Woman got off , I scuffled with him , but he got away from me , and ran away . To the best of my Knowledge , the Prisoners are the Men , but I ca n't swear positively to them . I advertised the Watch , and it was brought me again by Mr. Seddon , the Man that made it . This is my Watch . Mr. Seddon One Harry Grubb brought this Watch to me , the 1st of May ; it was advertised to be left with me . Grubb , Pawnbroker . On Saturday the 29th of April , the two Prisoners came to me with the Watch , and wanted to borrow 40 s. upon it ; ( I live in St. James's-Market ) O Hara is a Chairman , and plies there ; I asked him who was the Owner of the Watch ? He told me it was Tobin 's , who then appear 'd like a Sailor . I asked Tobin where he bought it ? He said , he bought it of a Mate of a Ship at Wapping . Then I asked him who it was made by ? And O Hara immediately answer 'd , - by Seddon , at St. James 's , who was his particular Friend . Upon this I lent 40 s. upon it . This was on Saturday the 29th of April , and on Monday Morning , seeing the Watch advertised , I carry 'd it to Mr. Seddon , and he said it was the same Watch which had been lost . He offer 'd me the three Guineas that was was offer 'd as the Reward in the Advertisement ; but I took no more than what I had lent upon it , and told him , I could help him to one of the Men that brought it to me . It was pawn 'd in Tobin 's Name , and O Hara averr 'd it was his ( Tobin 's ) Watch . Samuel Goodwin , the Pawnbroker 's Man , confirm 'd his Master 's Evidence . Judith Dalton . On Friday , the 28th of April , I went to Peter Street , to see Tobin and his Wife ; O Hara and one Brooks was there , and we all din 'd upon Mutton and Broth . Between 7 and 8 at Night , O Hara , and his Wife , Tobin , and his Wife , and I , went out to take a Walk . When we came near Piccadilly , Rose Tobin ( the Wife ) pick 'd up a Gentleman and carry 'd him into a House ; O Hara and Tobin follow 'd them in , but I staid at the Door till they came out ; and Rose said , she had got half a Crown . Then we all went on , and met this Man ( Claridge ) in a velvet Cap ; Tobin 's Wife and I , and the two Prisoners went after him ; and when we came up to him , O Hara took hold of him , and held him , while I took the Watch out of his Pocket . I saw no Money ; I ca n't tell who took that . Claridge . I had a Cap on that Night I was robb 'd . Dalton . When I had got the Watch , one of them held him , while Tobin 's Wife and I ran away to Clancey 's House ; and we had no sooner got in , but the Prisoners came in likewise ; we sat down , and I gave Tobin the Watch , and Clancey open 'd it , that Tobin might look at it . I did not mind it much myself ; so I ca n't be positive whether this is the Watch or not . Prisoners . Please to ask her where this Watch was taken ? Dalton . Just by a big Door , within some Rails , in Piccadilly ; but I am a Stranger to the Place . Tobin 's Wife stood at a little Distance , when I robb 'd him . Claridge . I was surpriz 'd , and so saw but one Woman . - Clancey . I keep the two Blue Posts in Compton Street , St. Ann 's . On the 28th of April , at Night , Dalton ( the Evidence ) and the two Prisoners were at my House , with their Wives , pretty late . After they had drank about 1 s. or 14 d. in Liquor , O Hara and his Wife went away , but Tobin and Dalton . About half an Hour after the Prisoner ( O Hara ) and his Wife were gone , Dalton pull 'd out the Watch , and I open 'd it . I ask 'd her whose it was , and she told me 't was her Husband 's . Dalton . I did not produce the Watch till they were gone , because O Hara was not willing his Wife should know what was taken that Night . Tobin felt the Watch in my Hand , immediately after I had taken it ; and O Hara knew I had got it when we were all together at Clancey 's . The next Morning , Tobin and O Hara went to pawn the Watch ; when they return 'd , they told me they had got but a Guinea and a half upon it . Please to ask Clancey if Tobin did not deliver him a Knife ? Clancey . He deliver 'd me this Knife , about a Week ago , last Tuesday . ( A very long sharp pointed Clasp Knife ) This is the Knife . Claridge . Twas was just such a Knife as this , one of them held to my Breast . Dalton . Some Time after this , we all quarrel 'd , and I went before a Justice and made a Discovery . Mr. Blackerby . Judith Dalton came one Morning before me ; and upon her Evidence , I issu 'd Warrants against the Prisoners . She gave an Account of the Fact perfectly consistent with that she gives now . That very Morning Tobin came to me , to let me know that he receiv 'd the Watch from her , and upon hearing the whole , I thought it my Duty to commit him , and his Companion . Tobin 's Defence . Dalton gave me the Watch , and desired me to pawn it for her . O Hara . Tobin told me Dalton had got him to pawn a Watch for her , and I only went along with him to the Pawnbroker 's . Lawrence Burn . I come for Tobin . He desired me to find out where Dalton lodged , for he said his Life depended upon it . I knew where she lodged , for I met her once in Peter Street , and she was enquiring her Way to her Lodgings in Holborn , I have no more to say , - only as I was going Home with her , I met Tobin and O Hara in the Street , and one Luttwych was with them . 'T is not every one that is endowed with Sense ; if I had , I should have left Dalton with O Hara and Tobin , and not have gone Home with her to her Lodgings . This I think was at Night , the 29th of April , when Dalton met with her Acquaintance , we all went together to an Alehouse , next Door to Justice Marget 's , in Castle Street . - I ca n't tell the Sign , but I know by their own Expressions , that Tobin 's Wife was there , and I left them all there , and went Home with Dalton to her Lodging . I am not so ignorant , but I know this was the 29th of April . Darby Mac Connor . On Friday the 28th of May , - April I mean , between 7 and 8 o'Clock , I was at Clancey 's , and saw the two Prisoners come in between 8 and 9 . They drank about 4 Quarts of Beer , and had a Penn'orth of Bread and Cheese , and a Ha ' p'orth of Onions . I saw no Body with them . I came in with Mr. Dod , and ask 'd them to drink with me . Clancey . I remember this Man came in that Night , but I ca n't tell whether the Prisoner came in about that Hour , - we have vast Business , - I ca n't tell whether they drank with Connor or not , but I am sure O Hara 's Wife was with him Connor I kept Company with the two Prisoners 'till between 11 and 12 o'Clock and then the Witness Dalton and Tobin 's Wife came in . Clancey . The Prisoners Wives were both in their Company . - Anticker . Connor was in Company with the two Prisoners and their Wives . They came in about 9 o'Clock , and staid till past 11. Richard Dodd . I was with Connor that Night at Clancey 's ; the Prisoners came in and eat and drank with us till the Watchman went Eleven , and then Dalton came in with O Hara 's and Tobin 's Wife . Dalton called for Liquor , and made the Prisoners come into their Company ; they sat some Time , and then O Hara , and his Wife , and Tobin 's Wife , went away , and Tobin himself was going along with us , but Dalton called him back and made him stay , so we went out and saw no more of them . - Sample , one who keeps a Publick House at Charing-Cross , and one Lewsly , never heard O Hara charged with Dishonesty before .

March the 11th . Arthur Ginn . On the 17th of March , between 4 and 5 in the Evening , the Post Man brought me a Letter from the General Post-Office , with the Town Mark upon it , I paid Three pence for it , and then open 'd it , and found the Contents of it were to demand 10 l. to be laid at such a Place , by Six o'Clock that same Evening . This was the Letter . To Mr. Ginn , in Noble Street , near Brick lane . This with Care . Mr. Ginn , `` We are 10 in a Gang , and desire you 'll lay 10 l. in the Corner of the Old House at Brick-Lane End , the 17 of this Month , by Six o'Clock in the Evening , or else we will set Fire to your House and burn you alive in your Beds . The Money you shall have again in a Month . I am your Humble Servant , B. R. '' Mr. Camm . On the 17th of March , Mr. Ginn shewed me this Letter about five o'Clock ; at six , out of my own Curiosity , I walked to the Old House , and as I went thither , I met a Friend , who went with me ; when I came to the Place , I found the Prisoner leaning against the Wall of the Old House , and reading in a Book ; I came back and told Mr. Ginn that I believed the Man was waiting for the Money . Then we sent another Man to see if the Person was still waiting at the same Place ; he returned and told he was yet waiting there . Upon this Mr. Ginn and I went to him , and asked him to go and drink with us ; he consented , and we went to the Cock in Old-street , where we charged him with Writing the Letter , and he denied it . I have nothing further to say , but only that I found him kicking the Brickbats about , as if he look 'd for something .
