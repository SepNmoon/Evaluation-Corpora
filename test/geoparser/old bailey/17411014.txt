James Buquois and Joseph Allen , of Stoke Newington , were indicted for assaulting Charles Wells in a certain field and open place near the King 's highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him an iron key , value 1 d. a glass ink-bottle cased with brass , value 6 d. and 2 s. 8 d. in money ; Sept. 8th . Charles Wells . On the 8th of September 1741 , about five in the evening , I was going from Newington-Green to Stoke-Newington : I came through a lane that is called Cut-Throat-Lane ; - rightly so named I believe : It is a foot-passage leading from Newington-Green to Newington ; and there are four fields at the end of the lane which lead to Stoke-Newington . When I came into the first field , I saw the Prisoner Allen entering it , and when I came nearer , he and Buquois closed me between them . Allen immediately pulled out a pistol , and with imprecations usual to this sort of gentry , said , Your money ! your money ! I desired him to spare my life , and then Buquois took out of my right-hand pocket two shillings , and this disputable six pence , and out of my other pocket , where I usually carry my half-pence , he took five-pence half-penny and my ink-bottle . When they first came up to me , I endeavoured to make some resistance with my cane : They had each of them pistols , and they asked me how I could offer to resist , when I saw they had got arms ? When they had rifled me , they were going away ; but I called after them , and desired them to let me have my key again , which they had taken with my money : Upon which Allen twirled it to me , and it fell in the grass . I then desired the prisoners to come back and look for it ; they did so , and then went off . I immediately pursued them , and met a gentleman 's servant , and told him I had been robb 'd , but he like a coward would not assist me . Upon this I went on 'till my spirits were much evaporated , and then I met with one Caton , and desired him to assist me , and die or vanquish . I gave him an exact description of the prisoners , and when I had run with him about two fields farther , I thought I should have burst , and was obliged to give over the pursuit . However several people coming to Caton 's assistance , the prisoners were both taken and carried to a public house . When they first came in , there was only a glimmering light , but a better being called for , I knew them to be the persons that robbed me . I desired Buquois to let me see what money he had in his pocket , and he pulled out two shillings and this very sixpence . It is a disputable sixpence , and I have had it a great while , and no body would take it . I told him , that six-pence was mine , and I would have it ; and I borrowed sixpence of the landlord , to give him in the room of it . Q . How long after the robbery did you see these men at the public house ? Mr. Wells . Presently afterwards . I am sure they are the men , and I never shall forget them while breath is in my body . I would observe , that Caton was the first man that I called to my aid . I had no weapon but this cane : I struck Allen with it , and in the scussle it was thrown on the grass . William Corne . I was in the pursuit in the way of taking them . They were in cover under a hedge in a ditch , and the people and I got over the hedge . I had a stick in my hand , and when I got over the hedge , I saw the youngest fellow ( Allen ) in the ditch . He immediately rushed out of the ditch with a pistol in each hand ; one of them was a brass pistol . He presented it at the people that were coming up , and said he would surrender ; but instead of that , he turned to running , and then shot the pistol off . The company coming pretty fast , he stepped back about a yard or two from them , dropped his pistols , and surrendered . Then I took up the pistols , and went with Caton 's man to take the other prisoner . We went up to the ditch where he was , and told him we would shoot him , if he would not surrender : He made no answer at first , but at last he said , D - n ye , I will kill or be killed , and immediately rushed out of the ditch , and some how or other Caton 's man got hold of his cloaths ; so that he ( Buquois ) fell on one knee , and we took him . John Corne . I was coming from town , and was told that two prisoners were upon Hackney Downs , and seeing my neighbour Corne run , I ran too , and just as we came into the field , Allen fired off the brass pistol ; then he dropped the other , and he was taken . The other prisoner coming out of the ditch , they took hold of him , and I being a headborough , charged them to aid and assist me , and we took them to the Black-moor 's Head at Clapton . William Caton . The prosecutor came to my shop , and complained of this robbery , and desired me to go to his assistance . He told me , they were gone towards London , and we enquired of some boys , and they informed us , the prisoners were gone towards the Downs . I went after them , and saw them , and my man said , these are the men that robbed the gentleman , which they hearing , immediately drew out their pistols , and swore , if we did not stand off , they would blow our brains out . Notwithstanding this , we pursued them for half an hour to no purpose ; but we got more assistance , and then took them . I searched Buquois in the field , and found in his pocket 4 s. 6 d. in silver , and about 5 d. in half-pence . After this we took them to the public house , where Buquois was searched again , and the prosecutor said , he could swear both to this sixpence and to the prisoners . James Babrooks . I am servant to Caton , and assisted him in taking the prisoners . I had a poker with me , and when I saw the prisoners , I said , those are the two men that robbed the gentleman ; which they hearing , pulled out their pistols , and said , they would blow our brains out , if we followed them . We pursued them half an hour or better , and then two or three men came to our assistance , and I sent to Clapton for a gun , and we took them in the ditch . Caton . While I was pursuing them , they came up to me , and said , they would give me a guinea , if I would be civil . I told them , I would have them dead or alive ; and then they offered me two guineas , and said they would be honourable . Samuel Wood the constable produced the pistols . DEFENCE . William Chipperfield . I have known the prisoner Buquois about twenty years : He served his time to his father , who is a weaver . I know nothing of him , but that he is a very honest man ; and I always took him to be three parts a natural . Francis Bellot . I have known him six years and upwards . He has worked at my house three times . The first time he worked with me he behaved well , only he behaved like a lunatick . He hung himself at my house once , and when I asked him the reason of it , he cried , and said he would do so no more ; but after that time I found him very various in his manners . Nathaniel Higgins . I worked with Buquois in the same shop about nine months , and he behaved well , only sometimes he would run down stairs as if he was frighted out of his wits , and call up the apple-people for nothing at all . I never heard that he attempted to destroy himself . Thomas Whitefield . I have known Buquois from a child ; he worked for me about five years ago , and I never heard any dishonesty of him . Philip Flamming . Buquois worked with me about seven years ago , and behaved well . - Buquois , the prisoner 's father . He has followed his business very well , and never wronged any body of a farthing . He used to carry bodds of mortar or do any thing for a livelihood when he was out of business ; and when he had done work ; he would behave himself almost like-a-lunatick . Prisoner Buquois . After I was taken , the prosecutor said , he could not swear to either of us , only they persuaded him to it . The butcher ( Caton ) swears to 4 s. being in my pocket , and he swears to 2 s. 6 d. if you please to take notice of it . Mr. Wills . I lost 2 s. 6 d. and an uncertain number of halfpence , and the money which Buquois pulled out and threw into his hat was 2 s. 6 d. and some halfpence . Caton . When I searched him in the field , I found 4 s. 6 d. in silver and about 6 d. in halfpence . We put it into his pocket again , and then carried him to the alehouse . The jury found the prisoners guilty Death . They were a second time indicted for assaulting William Johnson on the King 's highway in the Parish of St. Mary Stratford-Row , putting him in fear , and taking from him a silver watch , value 3 l. a glass seal set in base metal , val . 2 d. Sept. 7 . Allen was a third time indicted for assaulting Edward Lee the younger in a certain field and open place near the King 's highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him 13 s. in money ; June 7 . The prisoners on their arraignment pleaded not guilty , but being convicted on the former indictment , desired leave to retract their plea ; and accordingly pleaded guilty to each . 4. William Linwood was indicted for stealing two linen sheets , val 2 s. three linen aprons , val . 2 s. and four linen handkerchiefs , val . 4 d. the goods of Sarah Wright ; Aug. 20 . Sarah Wright . I keep the sign of the Dolphin in Dean Street , Sobe , and the prisoner was my servant . On the 20th of Aug . I was robbed of these things , and the prisoner confessed , both in my house and before the justice , that he let a woman into the house at 12 o'clock at night , and gave her the things when she went out in the morning . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5. Robert Ramsey , of St. Andrew 's Holborn , was indicted for stealing a pair of silver candlesticks , value 3 l. a pair of silver snuffers and stand , value 30 s. a silver coffee-pot , value 6 l. and a silver sugar-caster , value 30 s. the goods of Robert Glyn , in his dwelling-house ; Aug. 24 . Mr. Robert Glyn . I live in Hatton-Garden . I went out of town in August last for about ten days , and left my house and the plate mentioned in the indictment in the custody of several servants . I returned to town on the 24th of August , and found that I had been robbed . I know nothing more . Thomas Colby . On the 24th of August last , about seven o'clock in the morning , I saw the prisoner and the evidence at Mr. Glyn 's door . The prisoner went into the house , and was in for the space of two or three minutes . I saw him come out again with something wrapped up in a red handkerchief : It was of a large bulk , but what it was I ca n't tell . I was opposite to the house , in Hatton-Garden . Q . Did you know the prisoner before ? Colby . I have seen him go up the same street several mornings before . Q . Look at him now : Is that the man you saw go into Mr. Glyn 's house ? Colby . Yes , I am sure of it . Q . Had he any thing in his hand when he went in ? Colby . No , nothing at all . The door appeared to me to be shut , but he took hold of the knocker of the door , and it opened , and he went in . Prisoner . What time was this ? Colby . About seven in the morning . Prisoner . You say you saw me go into the house ; on your oath , had I a bundle in my hand or not ? Colby . No , you had not . Prisoner . What was it tied up in ? Colby . It was in a red handkerchief . Prisoner . How did I go in ? - Repeat that again . Colby . You went up one side of the street , and your brother on the other , and passed the door . You afterwards came back , and went both up to the door together ; your brother stood on the step , and you went up to the door . Prisoner . You say you was on the opposite side of the way ; how then can you swear to me ? Colby . I have seen you several times before . Prisoner . Did I never come to have my wig combed out at your shop ? Colby . Yes , before this , but never afterwards . Mr. Glyn 's maid . I went out to change a guinea , and left my master 's door a-jar ; it was on the 24th of August about seven in the morning . I went to change a guinea at a grocer 's in Holbourn , and I turned back and could see this man ( the prisoner 's brother ) beckoning to my master 's door . I said to the grocer , who can that gentleman be that is beckoning so to our door ! he said I need not be surprised , and then I saw the prisoner come from the door with a bundle in a silk handkerchief . I was vastly concerned because I knew the door was left a jar . The prisoner came out and smil 'd at his brother who stood at the step of the door , and they crossed Holbourn as fast as they could , and when I went in I found the door not as I left it , and the parlour and beauset doors both open . I called to my fellow servant and ask 'd him if he had medd led with the plate , and he said he had not . Q . How did you find the house at your return ? Mr. G. 's maid . I left the door as close as it could be without locking , and when I returned it was wider , and the parlour and beauset doors wide open : I had cleaned the rooms just before , and I am sure they were shut then . Prisoner . You say you saw me come out with a handkerchief ! Mr. G. 's maid . I saw you yourself , and you are the man . Q . What colour was the handkerchief ? Mr. G. 's maid . I believe it was a reddish colour and some white in it . Prisoner . Did you see me go in ? Mr. G. 's maid . No , but I saw you come out . Prisoner . You say you seemed to express some fear to your neighbour , why then did you not call some assistance to help you ? Mr. G. 's maid . Because I had an honest heart and you had not . Prisoner . A very honest heart indeed to let a man escape with your master 's plate . William Mitchel . I am footman to Mr. Glynn , and was in the parlour about half an hour after 6 o'clock on the 24th of August , and I saw a coffee pot , a pair of silver candlesticks , snuffers and stand , and a sugar castor , and likewise a little candlestick for a wax candle which was not taken with the rest . I was at the kitchen door when my fellow servant went out , and I put my hand against the parlour door and found that it was fast . Prisoner . You say you are positive this plate was there ! Mitchel . Yes , I am . John Ramsey . My brother and I committed this robbery . On the 24th of August we went into Hatton-Garden : He on one side of the way and I on the other , and I saw Mr. Glynn 's door a-jar . I acquainted him with it , and we turn 'd back . He went in and brought out part of the plate in his handkerchief and part in his pocket : - It was an India handkerchief and some white in it , and the plate he brought out was the same that Mr. Glynn speaks of . C. What employment are you ? Ramsey . I serv 'd my time to a snuff box maker ; and the prisoner is a chymist , but we went out upon these designs . When my brother had got these things , he cross 'd the way , and gave me a coffee pot , and one candlestick . We then cross 'd Holbourn and went down Shoe Lane : I went home with the things that he had given me , and he followed in a short time with the rest . When I got home I took the coat of arms out of the coffee pot , and I sold part of them to a silversmith : - There were not coats of arms on all of them . Q . Who were they sold to ? Ramsey . I sold the candlestick , snuffers and stand to this man Mr. Lee , for 5 s. 4 d. an ounce , and I carried the money to my brother . The coffee pot was sold 2 or 3 days afterwards to another person , but I did not see it sold . The castor I broke to pieces and sold to divers silversmiths . He gave me five and twenty shillings for defacing the arms , and the castor I sold unknown to him and told him it was stopp 'd . Prisoner . Why did you make yourself an evidence ? Ramsey . I was persuaded to it . Prisoner . Have you never declared that some of these matters which you have now spoken of were the whole truth ? - your brother 's life is at stake ; for God 's sake speak nothing but the truth . Ramsey . I have declared the whole truth . Prisoner . Did you never declare that part of what you have now said was false ? Ramsey . No , I never did . Q . Did you give the Prisoner the money that these things were sold for ? Ramsey . He had the money at the rate of five shillings an ounce . - Lee . This John Ramsey came into my shop on the 24th of August , and brought a pair of silver candlesticks , snuffers and stand : I put them into the scale and asked him what he must have an ounce ? he said 5 s. 4 d. and told me he did not understand them , and desired me if they were worth more to give it him . I said , that was the full market price , but I had not cash enough in the house , so I ask 'd him to change me a bank note of 20 l. he could not , and I left him in my shop half an hour while I was gone to get it changed . Q . Had you ever seen him before ? Lee . I had seen him about the beginning of August , and he ask 'd me if I bought old silver . He pulled out about half an ounce and asked me what I gave an ounce for old plate ? I asked him what it was ? and he told me an old lady was dead in the country and had left him some plate for a legacy , and he would dispose of it or change it : I told him I should be very proud to serve him in either way , and as he appeared like a gentleman I really thought the things had been his own . Joseph Clifton . John Ramsey sold the bottom of a castor to me and I gave him 5 s. per ounce for it : I ca n't say exactly the time but it was after the 24th of August . DEFENCE . Prisoner . May it please your lordship : I shall call a few witnesses to prove my character and my manner of life , and to contradict part of what the evidence has said , and I hope you will observe how inconsistent one circumstance is with another . I call John Williams to prove that my brother express 'd a sorrow for what he had done . John Williams . I went last Friday to see John Ramsey in the Gate-house : I had him into a room , and we had a pot of beer , and he told me he was very sorry and was forced to do that which was not true . Q . What conversation passed between you ? Williams . I ask 'd him how this happen 'd to come about , and he told me his brother and he were abroad together . Prisoner . Did not he declare that what he had said was an untruth ? Williams . He told me twice that he had said more than he should have said . Q . How came you to go to talk with him ? Williams . I happen 'd to see it in the news papers , and the prisoner desired me to talk to him about it , and he told me in general that what he had said was more than truth . Robert Williams . There happened a quarrel between the prisoner and his brother about some money which was at the head of the prisoner 's bed : that money being lost in making the bed , the prisoner laid it to his brother 's charge , upon which John Ramsey came to me , and desired me to make it up for him with his brother : upon which I bid John Ramsey desire his brother to come to me about an affair that had happened to me . This was on a Thursday , and the Monday following , John Ramsey came to me and told me he had desired his brother to come to me , and if he would not make it up he would be revenged on him if he was sure to damn his soul , or words to that effect . I was then at work in the garret and I went down in my shirt into my one pair of stairs room , and staid with him a matter of two or three hours . This was about a fortnight before the prisoner was charged with this fact . As to the prisoner 's character , I never heard ( any ) harm , nor knew none ( any ) by him 'till now , but he always behaved like a gentleman , and followed his practice . I was told he had very pretty practice . Richard Swift . The prisoner lodged in my house six weeks , about 5 months ago , and behaved very well : he had it in his power to wrong me and never did . Mary Swift . I know nothing of the fact , but the prisoner lodged in our house 5 or 6 weeks . I keep a house in New-street and never lock 'd up any thing at all from him , and never lost any thing . Mary Williams . Robert Williams my husband is a looking glass polisher , and the prisoner was his school-fellow . I never saw or knew any harm by him . The prisoner 's brother told my husband of the quarrel about the money , and that he had said a great many words in his passion that he was sorry for , and desired my husband to make it up between them , for they never had such a quarrel in their lives ; and he swore bitterly if he did not make it up , he would he revenged on him , or it should be worse for him . Sarah Immins . I have known the prisoner to lodge in Mr . Swift 's house , and took him to be a very honest man . Prisoner . I hope you will please to take into consideration the evidence upon the whole . As he has told these people he would be revenged on me , I hope ( gentlemen ) you will consider how far his words are to be credited . He is taken up over night , and next morning charges me with these things ; you will please to observe , upon cool reflection , he is sorry for what he has done . I hope you will likewise consider that my business was sufficient to maintain me in an auent way , above the reach of the world . You will please to observe there is a small contradiction with respect to the 2d witness : she swears it was a red and white handkerchief , and another says it was a red one . The evidence likewise says he sold the plate : if I had had any hand in it I certainly should have sold it myself ; and he also says he sunk the money for the castor : these improbabilities all considered together will ( I hope ) determine in my favour , and that you will be of the opinion that they have grounded their evidence entirely on what he has said . It is a very hard case to be sure , and when people lose their goods the persons that take them ought to suffer , but I hope you will take it in consideration that I had not these goods with which I stand charged . John Ramsey . As to what these people have said , I never said any such thing : only that I was very sorry to be an evidence against my own brother , and that I was persuaded to it . Prisoner . Was you not in private with the justice , and was you not threatned by him ? Ramsey . The justice had me into a room by himself , but what I have sworn is very true . The jury found the prisoner guilty ; Death . He was again indicted for stealing 2 silver spoons , a pair of silver tea tongs , a silver tea spoon , a silver strainer , a silver tea spoon double gilt , a silver tea pot , and a silver cream pot ; the goods of Thomas Griffith in the house of John Harrison in the parish of St. George the Martyr , July 20 . Mary Griffith . We lost the goods mentioned in the indictment out of Mr. Harrison 's house , in little Orange-street , about the middle of July last . These now produced are part of them . John Ramsey . I was present when my brother went into a house in little Orange-street and took these goods . I saw him go into the house and he brought out these things and carried them to his lodgings . I sold the cream pot myself to a silversmith in Fleet Street . Prisoner . Ask Mrs. Griffith if those are her property . Mrs. Griffith . Yes ; this I bought of Mr. Godfrey that is dead and gone . Prisoner . One thing may be like another , Madam . Mrs. Griffith . It is remarkable enough , for here is the hall mark . All the things they took had no coats of arms on them . Prisoner . I call this first witness to my character ; I lodged at his house fifteen months . - Havingdon . The Prisoner lodged in my house 15 months and upwards , and behaved himself in a very handsom , decent way . I gave him warning because he kept company with a woman , and I would not have any such lodgers in my house , but he never defrauded me of any thing . I have trusted him with the keys of every thing while I have been out of town a week together , and he never wrong 'd me . John Williams and Robert Williams deposed to the same effect as in the former trial . - Cow . I happened to be in company with John Ramsey this week , and he said , if what had been done had not been done , he would have taken it on himself , and he seemed to intimate that he was forced to it , and was sorry for what he had done . Prisoner . I shall submit it to your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury , from the character that has been given him , how far his oath is to be taken . Guilty Death . 6. George Cantrill was indicted for stealing three pewter plates , value 14 d. the goods of Thomas Cooke ; Sept. 15 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7.

Mary Page of St. Mildred in the Poultrey , was indicted for stealing two silk brocaded gowns , a green silk tabby gown , a white dimity gown , a long velvet scarf , a scarlet cloth cloak , two linen laced caps , a linen laced handkerchief , three silk handkerchiefs , a lawn apron , a child 's silk cloak , a silk short apron , a pair of white cotton stockings , a pair of worsted stockings , and two guineas , the goods of Rice Price , in his dwelling-house ; Sept. 1 . And Elizabeth Farrow alias Jackson , for receiving part of the said goods , knowing them to be stolen , Sept. 3 . Rice Price . The prisoner Page was my servant . On the 1st of Sept. last I was robbed of the goods mentioned in the indictment . I had reason to suspect the prisoner , and went to enquire after her , and the first person I met was her sister . She took me to Spittle-Fields-Market , to see for the prisoner Farrow , who she said had harboured her sister a great while . I got a warrant that evening for Page and Farrow , and the next day I heard where Farrow had pawned one of the gowns , and I went to the pawnbroker 's and found it accordingly . After this I got intelligence , that the two prisoners and another had taken coach to Tower-Hill , but we could not hear any thing of them there ; however about 12 o'clock at night I apprehended Farrow , and she found out Page , who owned the fact , and delivered up two gowns and a short cloak , which she said were all that she had in her possession , but if I would be favourable to her , she would tell where the rest of the things were , and accordingly she herself went to a pawn-broker 's at Westminster and demanded a brocaded gown and a long scarf , which were mine , and part of what I lost at this time . Prisoner Page . Ask my master if he did not deliver these things to me ? Mr. Price . No , I never did . They were all under lock and key , and my wife always had the key in her possession . Prisoner Page . Did not you recommend me to your wife ? Mr . Page . No , upon my oath , I never did ; I never knew any thing of her before she came to be hired . Jury . Was the lock of the place broke , in which these things were ? Mr. Price . No , but two or three days after this creature came , my wife happened to lose the key . Prisoner Farrow . The Prisoner desired me to pawn a gown for her , and she told me Mr. Price had given it to her . Matthew Peter Sollom . I was charged with the Prisoner , ( Page I think her name is ) before my lord mayor to convey her to Newgate , and I went with her to that gentlewoman 's house in Duke Street Westminster and she discovered a gown and a scarf that she had pawned there for 3 l. 10 s. and she said she took them from her master . I saw her the next day in Newgate , and heard her say she had no way to get off but by insinuating that the clothes were given her by her master for favours which ( she would say ) he had received from her , although , as she own 'd , without the least foundation . Ann Skelton . The prisoner Page came to my house with a water-boy . She said she had a brother that was trepann 'd , and that she must pawn some things for money to get him off . I lent her 3 l. 12 s. on these things ; and she had other bundles with her but I did not look at them . She told me she lived with one lady Richards over the water . Page . I desire my mistress may be asked from whom she had the character of me ? Mrs. Price , I happened to be very much out of order when she came to be hired , and I told her I could not go out for her character that day . She told me she lived at a surgeon 's at Lime-house Bridge , and so I fix 'd 3 or 4 days afterwards to go there ; but she came to me again and told me her mistress was going out of town that very day , and that if I would accept of it , she would write me a recommendatory letter : that letter was afterwards brought me by a man and I appointed her to come . Prison . Page . My master knew the man that brought that letter . Sollom . Page told me herself that Mr. Price was as honest a man as ever was born , and she had no way to get off but by darkening his character . - Fellows . On the 3d of September the prisoner Farrow pawned a flower 'd gown with me : I asked her how she came by it , and she said it was a gentlewoman 's who was in trouble and who could not come herself with it . This is the gown . Mrs. Price . This is mine , and it was lost at the same time with the other things . I lost the key of the chest of drawers in which these things were , while the prisoner was with me , but having another key which opened the drawers as well , I did not mind the loss of the other . Farrow . Page brought the gown to me , and told me her master had given it to her ; so I pawned it at Mr. Fellows 's ; but I have no witnesses to that but herself . Hannah Smith . I have known Page about the market several years ; and as for thieving or doing any such things , I never heard any such thing of her . Sarah Page . I am her sister-in-law , and never knew that she ever robbed any body . Rebecca Winterbottom . I come to speak what I know of that woman , Page ; she lived a servant in the hospital two years , but left it on account of the offensive smells ; and we never heard nothing ill of her . Page guilty , Death : Farrow guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 11. Jane Bignel was indicted for stealing a pair of worsted hose , value 3 s. the goods of Richard Coombs ; Sept. 26 .

Richard Dance . On Sunday the 6th of September I had been at Battersea , and returning late at night through St. James 's Park , I heard the drum beat at the Tilt-yard . I then thought it my nearest way to get upon the Parade , in order to go out . I had not got above 30 yards upon the green park , but the prisoner came up to me and knocked me down . As soon as he came up to me he pulled out a knife , and made an attempt upon me , at the same time telling me , if I made any noise or resistance , he would murder me . I desired him to spare my life , upon which he held the knife in order to murder me , and I holding up my hand in my defence , he cut my fingers in this manner . He then took from me my watch , a case of instruments , 1 s. 6 d in silver , and 4 d. in copper . I was very much bruised , beat and cut , and when he had robbed me , he ran away , but being encouraged by people coming by , I pursued him . He still continued his course , and in the pursuit he slipped off his coat and Waistcoat , and this centry laid hold of him . Q . How came you to know it was the prisoner ? Dance . It was a moon-light night , but a little cloudy . I am very positive to him , for he never was out of my sight till he was detected by this witness . Q . How far had he gone before he was taken ? Dance . About two or three yards , according as the people ran : he might be sometimes nearer , and sometimes farther . Prisoner . Ask him where we met together ? Dance . No where but where I tell you ; on the grass part of the park that leads from the Mall to the Parade . John Smith . I was centry on St. James 's Park ; and about half an hour past ten at night , I heard a gentleman call out Murder ! I went over to the middle of the Mall and heard Murder cried again . I called out , Where are you ? the same cry was repeated two or three times , and then I saw the prisoner running away with his coat and waistcoat on his arm . This gentleman ( Dance ) was running after him , and I likewise went up with a design to take hold of him . He ran as far as the first centry that belongs to the Tilt-yard , and then he turned towards Buckingam House . I took him by the rail , coming off the grass , and got hold of the collar of his shirt , but that giving way , I delivered him to the care of some soldiers , and they let him escape . He then went to his house , and after having put on his regimental clothes he came to the Tilt yard and was retaken . Q . What became of the prisoner 's other clothes ? Smith . He dropp 'd them , and the prosecutor pick 'd them up and gave them to me . Q . What light had you to see the prisoner 's face ? Smith . It was a moonlight night but a little cloudy . After the prisoner had escaped from the soldiers , 2 corporals came to me and desired me to let the drummer ( the Prisoner ) have his clothes , but I refused , for I had laid them up in security in order to give them to the pay-serjeant . Q . Did the prisoner own those clothes ? Smith . Yes , he own 'd them before the Justice . Mr. Dance . I pick 'd up the clothes myself and gave them to this soldier . I saw the prisoner drop them , and I saw them afterwards at a public house . Smith . The prisoner was carried before justice Manley , where the prosecutor swore to him , and when he found he was going to be committed to the Gate House , he owned the clothes and desired to have them again . William Pierce . I was on the Tilt-yard guard as a corporal when the prosecutor came up , and my captain ordered me to go with him to find the prisoner . He ( the prosecutor ) was all over bloody , and one of his fore fingers was cut very deep . Captain Lowry ordered me to go to St. James 's with him , and in going along I went to Smith and asked him if he could tell me who was concern 'd in it : he told me Tom . Sheerer could , and at last I was informed that Jack Smith himself had got the prisoner 's clothes : upon which we came down with another soldier towards St. James 's House , and saw Smith coming out with the clothes , and so we went with them to the Goat ale-house in the Pav 'd alley , where we searched the pockets , and found in them a leather sort of a round thing with a hole in it , a purse with 2 s. in it , and a piece of stuff that belongs to the brace of a drum , which made me think they belonged to a drummer . I desired the gentleman to go home that night , and promised him to find the man if I could . Accordingly after I had made all the enquiry I could , about 3 quarters of an hour after 11 at night I went towards Whitehall , and the prisoner came by in company with Scholes and Holbrook . I ask 'd them what the prisoner 's name was ? they told me Quaites ; so I call 'd him and took hold of him by the collar and told him he was my prisoner . He desired me to let him go and see for his clothes , but I carried him to the guard-room and charged him with the two serjeants of the guard : he was detained all night , and the next day carried before justice Manley . Q . What clothes had the prisoner on when you took him ? Pierce . He had his regimental drum clothes on . Prisoner . Did not I desire to go and see the prosecutor upon St. James 's guard ? Pierce . No , only to see his clothes , and I told him I had got them in custody , and I would take care of them . William Cowton , Serjeant . This corporal ( Pierce ) brought the prisoner to me , upon which I confined him directly . I got a drum cord and tied his 2 legs and arms together , and set a centry over him with a drawn sword 'till morning . I saw the prosecutor that night ; he was very bloody and came to make his complaint to captain Lowry , and I told him I would use my endeavours to find the man . Rowland Davis . I am the constable that had the warrant against the prisoner . He denied the fact before the justice , but own 'd that he was in the scuffle ; and that he saw some money in the prosecutor 's hand , and that it dropp 'd in the grass . Q . Was there any thing said about the clothes ? Davis . They were saying that he was in his shirt , and he owned that he was in a scuffle and lost his clothes . John Andrews , serjeant , confirmed the deposition of William Cowton , with this addition , that the prisoner owned he had lost his clothes , that he had the prosecutor 's money , and that he had given it him to conduct him through the park : that he ( this witness ) went next morning with the prisoner , at his desire , to look in the grass for the watch , but that it was not found . DEFENCE . I had been to see a comrade to Hammersmith , and being in liquor , and coming through the Park in my way home I sat down , and fell asleep . While I was asleep , this gentleman came up , and tapp 'd me on the thigh , and asked me if I was asleep ? I said yes : what is that to you ? he ask 'd me if my breeches were cloth or leather : I ask 'd if he had not his feeling . After this he offered some indecencies to me , and I told him he should go with me to the centry : he desired me not to expose him , and pull 'd out some money which he threw on the grass , and then fell to beating me . He then cried out murder ! I am robb 'd of my watch ! and a chairman and a woman came to my assistance . My coat was pretty wide , and my waistcoat had no sleeves , and they slipp 'd off in the scuffle . I told the chairman how it was between us , and so he gave me my clothes . I had got them on my arm , and this centry came up and took the clothes from me , and I went off . About an hour and half afterwards , hearing that such a thing was alledged against me , I surrender 'd myself to these two men , and was with them when Smith seized me . John Walkinshaw . I was centry in St. James 's Park at nine o'clock at night , the next post to Spring Garden Gate , and the horse parrole came past me . I heard a sort of a murmuring which I thought was in the wilderness : - There was no moonlight nor any such thing , but it was a very dark night . For about 2 minute and an half all was quiet and still , and then I heard a cry of thieves ! I am robb 'd ! I was a little surprised and kept still on the watch , and as I listen 'd the voice came nearer to me . I thought I heard a patting on the grass , so I went to the rails , and peep 'd between the sky in this manner , and I saw something moving . Presently I could hear stop thief ! I am robb 'd ! and afterwards the prisoner and this gentleman came up . They were 3 yards asunder , and the prosecutor had neither his hat nor wig on . The gentleman said he was robb 'd , and the prisoner said , he had offered something vile to him . I damn 'd them both , and ask 'd them how they came there ? The gentleman said he came in at Buckingham gate , and that the prisoner pretended to shew him the nearest way to the Tilt-yard guard . I detain 'd the prosecutor and took him into my centry box ; and then he complaining that his head was very cold for want of his hat and wig . I went with him to look in the grass for them . He found them both , and then I was for taking him back again , but he desired me not to be in a hurry , for he believed he should find his watch : G - D - you , says I , ( I ask pardon for swearing , for I did say so ) did you not tell me the man had got your watch ? He grovel 'd in the grass 20 or 30 times for the space of a minute and half and could not find it . I then gave the prosecutor over to a man nearer the Tilt-yard guard , and as we were carrying him along he fell to eating apples out of his pocket , and if I would be so good as to take his waistcoat , he said he would come in the morning , and he desired me not to expose him , for he did not know whether the fellow had his watch or no . I told him if he would not give me 20 guineas and his waistcoat I would not let him go , and so I delivered him up to the other centry . Q . Did the prosecutor appear to be bloody at that time ? Walkinshaw . I ca n't tell . I had him by the arm , and told him if he offered to stir a foot , I was loaded and would shoot him . After I had delivered the prosecutor to the centry , I ask 'd Smith where the fellow was that ran away , and he said he had got his clothes . Smith took hold of the prisoner , and I seiz 'd the gentleman . John Perkins , deposed to the same effect . John Scholes . I was at the suttling house with my comrade , and hearing a noise in the Park , I ran and met the prisoner in the gravel walk between the Mall and the chairs which are put for people to sit in . He is a drummer , and I was very much surpriz 'd to hear him charged with such a thing , and I bid the centry take care of him ; but while I was turning myself round , he rushed out of the centry 's hand . Immediately I turn 'd to the prosecutor , and seeing him bare headed , I asked him where his hat and wig were ? He said the rogue had robb 'd him of them , and the centry that had hold of him said he should go before the officer of the guard . He had not gone above ten or twelve steps before he desired to look for his hat and wig , and he went into a lonesom place by the side of the canal , call 'd the Princess 's walk : a place not sit for them to be in , for every centry has orders to keep people out of it even in the day time . He grovel 'd about some time , and sound his hat and wig , and after that being pretty much 'frighted , he desired the centry to stay a little and let him look for his watch . The centry would not stay , but took him along , and he offered to give any satisfaction in the world not to be exposed . After this , hearing that Smith had got the prisoner 's clothes , I desired him to let me have them , but he refused . I and my comrade then went to our quarters at the Horse Granadier Drum in King Street , and while we were eating some pork , the prisoner came in and surrender 'd himself to us , and we were carrying him to the guard when Smith met us and took him . John Holbrook was the person to whom the prisoner was delivered by Smith . He deposed , that the prisoner rushed from him , without his clothes . The other part of his evidence was of the same tenor as that given by Scholes . John Moore . I was on White-ball guard , and went to the Horse and Drum , to drink a pint of beer , and the prisoner coming in , the corporals accused him of robbing the gentleman in the park . He denied it , and surrender 'd himself up into their custody . - Terry . I keep the Horse Granadier Drum in King-street , and Holbrook and Scholes are quarter 'd at my house . They came in by themselves about half an hour after 10 at night and sat down . I asked them to eat some pork , and they told me there had been a great stir in the park , and that a drummer had robbed a man . They had not drank a pot of beer before the prisoner came in . They charged him with it , and he surrender 'd directly . Prisoner . A man came to me last Sunday , and asked me if any body was concerned with me , and if I did not impeach them , he said , the prosecutor would bring a man that should hang me right or wrong . This is the man . Samuel Stone . The prosecutor told me he had been robbed , and I went to Newgate with another person to see one Downes , who is a debtor there . The prisoner was then sitting in an adjacent box , and I told him , if any body was concerned with him , I would have him make himself an evidence , and he said , he could not do it now . The prosecutor bears the character of an honest worthy man . Thomas Bamford , John Marshal , and J - R - had known the prosecutor different numbers of years , and always took him to be a very sober honest man . Guilty Death . 19.

And William Frankland for receiving them , knowing them to be stolen . William Wyrill . On Friday night , I ca n't remember the day of the month , but it was in August last , about 11 at night , I went backwards and saw Mr. Harvey 's warehouse door safe . There is a press in the warehouse , and that was fast too ; and the next morning the warehouse door was found open , and a piece of Holland and a razor-case lying on the ground . Q . What time was this ? Wyrill . I am servant to Mr. Stevenson , of whom Mr. Harvey rents the warehouse , and I went out about 7 o'clock in the morning , and seeing the warehouse door broke open , I informed Mr. Harvey of it , and he examined his press and missed these things . On the Monday following Mr. Harvey advertised them , and about 11 o'clock a person in Newgate sent a letter to Mr. Harvey , informing him , that the man who stole the goods was detained . Upon this I went to the prisoner Frankland , who was a debtor in Newgate , and saw the goods in his possession . Culliford was brought here then , and I could not see him at that time . Frankland took me into his room and shewed me the things , and said he gave Culliford a guinea and an half , and half a crown for them . C. Do you know any thing of Culliford 's being brought before the Lord Mayor ? Wyrill . When I came to Newgate , it being Sessions time , Culliford was brought here , and while he was before the Lord Mayor , he said he came to see Frankland in Newgate , and that he had these goods from another person on the other-side of the water . Prisoner Frankland . I wrote Mr. Harvey the letter , and I desire it may be read . [ It was read . ] '' To Mr. John Stephens at his house in Corbet `` Court. `` Sir , `` I have read the Daily Advertiser this day , and `` can help you to some of your goods that you `` have lost ; but pray let it be kept a secret , and I `` shall help you to the rogue 100 . I am a debtor in `` the common side of Newgate , and have been so `` these five years ; but you shall find an honest man `` when you come to me . Let no body know your `` business ; if you do , I shall be murdered among `` thieves and rogues . Pray send for me down into `` the lodge , and be as private as you can . This `` from `` Your humble servant to command , Common side of Newgate , Monday Aug. 31 , 1741. `` W. Frankland . Ambrose Harvey . I saw these goods safe in the press in my warehouse on Friday night , and they were gone on Saturday morning . The warehouse door was open , and the lock of the press was torn off Charles Shuckburgh . On Monday the 31st of Aug . I was desired to secure Culliford ; and I took him into the parlour here , before the Lord Mayor . He owned that he had carried goods to Frankland in Newgate , upon which I had a warrant , and took these goods out of Frankland 's room . These two pieces were produced before the Lord Mayor , and Culliford owned that he had delivered them , and as many more , to Frankland for a guinea and half and half a crown . Thomas Pert . I have been a debtor upwards of two years in Newgate . About a week before last Sessions , I was walking in the hall , and Culliford and another person came up to the hatch : we drank half a pint of gin together , and while we were drinking it , Frankland came up , and said , Jack , how are you ? ( for we vulgarly call him Jack ) you are soon come back . Yes , says Jack , I told you I should not stay long . Well , says Frankland , I would have you look sharp , and see what you can get , and bring it to me : let it he what it will , I will take it off your hands . I was then called away , and heard no more 'till the goods were found . Frankland . Have not you and I had a difference ? He came behind me and knocked me down with a stick . Pert . That was half a year ago , and we have been very good friends since that . Ann Brown . I have been seventeen months a debtor in Newgate . I went to the grate about my own business ; I ca n't exactly tell the time , but I believe it was the Friday before Culliford was taken . Frankland shook hands with him , and said , I am glad to see thee , Jack ! and if you get any thing worth your while , bring it to me , and if it is the King 's plate , I will take it of you . I afterwards heard Frankland say he had read the Advertiser , that he had sent the gentleman a letter , and had stopped Jack Culliford for the goods . C. Did not he say he had the goods from Culliford ? Brown . That very day that the goods were advertised , with five guineas reward , Frankland told me and Doctor Nixon , that Culliford had brought him some goods , and that he had sent to Mr. Harvey as soon as he saw the advertisement . Q . Did he say at that time that he had caused Gulliford to be taken ? Brown . He vow 'd and protested that he had taken Gulliford . C. What time of the day had you this discourse ? Brown . Between two and three in the afternoon . Mr. Shuckburgh . I believe it was between twelve and one when I took Gulliford . Gulliford . I got up betimes in the morning , and met Tom . Boredon with these goods in a bag . He was in an information himself , and therefore desired me to carry them to Frankland . I did so , and asked 3l . for them by his directions . Frankland gave me a guinea and half and half a crown in part , and I carried it to Boredon , who waited for me at the Guy Earl of Warwick in Warwick Lane . When Frankland had given me the money , he put an old pair of breeches and a broken punch-bowl into the bag , because the turnkeys should not think I had left any thing in the goal . He desired me to bring Boredon to him when Mr. Wilcox was at the Magpie , and I did so , and I heard him tell Boredon , that he was going to be moved to the King 's Bench , and therefore should want money , but he would make it up 3 l. On the Monday following I went to the Porto-Bello in Chick-lane , and seeing the things advertised , I got the paper , and brought it to Frankland . He clapped me on the shoulder , and said , What are you going to be a thief and thief catcher too ! I will stop you , and so he called for a pen and ink and wrote to the gentleman , and had me taken . Frankland . This Gulliford came to me and brought these things to me as India goods . I told him Maryland and Virginia were a great way from the East-Indies . He said he came north about for fear of the privateers , and coming along side of an India man , he swopp 'd ( exchanged ) rum for these goods . He wanted two guineas on them : I had a guinea and half , and half a crown and 4 s. in silver , and upon his promise to fetch his goods away on monday , I lent him a guinea and half , and half a crown and a shilling . He asked me if I had any old rags ? and so I gave him an o 'd pair of breeches , and a punch bowl to put into his bag for fear the people should take notice . I shewed my wife these goods , and she telling me they were not India , I imagined he had robb 'd some Scotch pedlar of them , and as soon as the gates were open , I sent for the Advertiser , and seeing them advertised , I sent a letter to the gentleman . Culliford coming to me afterwards , I desired Mr. Wilcox to secure him , and I delivered the goods to the gentleman . I deliver 'd the goods in one hand , and the thief in the other , and what could any honest man do more ? What reason the gentleman had to charge me with felony , I ca n't tell : I have lost my money : I have let him have his goods without money , and yet I have been charged with felony . Joanna Hianson . I am a prisoner myself , and I heard Tom . Pert say he would do for Frankland and hang him right or wrong : Mrs. Brown said the same , on the virtue of my oath , and this not once , but several times . This I heard in the Stone-ball , the very day that Frankland 's irons were put on . Pert . I never spoke no ( any ) such words in my life . Brown . In the room of this , I have given him 20 drams since he has been in goal ; I pitied him , and always said I would not hurt a hair of his head Gulliford guilty 4 s. 10 d. Frankland guilty . John Glew Gulliford was again indicted , for that he at the sessions of goal delivery held at Justice-hall in the Old Bailey , before the right honourable Humphery Parsons , Esq ; & c. & c. with one Herbert Blackburn was try 'd on an indictment , for that they in the parish of St. Leonard Eastcheap , Nov. 5 eight pieces of velvet lined with fine ticken , made up for the furniture of a hearse and five horses , in the dwelling house of William Hazledine did steal , & c. and thereon by a certain jury of the country , & c. in that behalf taken , they were convicted of the stealing the said goods , to the value of 39 s. and were ordered for transportation , & c. and for that he the said Gulliford on the 1st of Sept . was at large in the Parish of St. Sepulchre , before the expiration of the term for which he was ordered to be transported . The record of the prisoner 's conviction , and the order for his transportation were read . Mr. Humphries . I know the prisoner , and remember he was convicted at the suit of one Hazledine in little East-cheap for 8 horse cloths . I am sure he is the very same man . I was present when he was cast along with one Blackburn or Coleburn , or some such name . Prisoner . You need give yourselves no farther trouble . The people of the ship were all sick , and 4 or 5 of us were called upon deck to work the ship , and at the back of the Isle of Wight I got into the pilot 's boat , and came away . Guilty Death .

He was a second time charged by virtue of the coroners inquest for the said murder . Sarah Austin . On the 2d of Sept . I was at breakfast at my shop in the Fleet-market , and saw the prisoner and the deceased run by my window . Hearing the prisoner say , D - n you , you son of a B - I will have my ends of you . I ran from my breakfast , and saw the prisoner hold his knife in his hand , on this side of him . I ran directly out of my shop , and I saw the prisoner take the knife from the side of his clothes , and stab it into the deceased , just into his heart . Q . What sort of a knife was it ? Austin . It was a small bladed knife with a point to it ; - this is the knife : it is a sort of a case knife ground down , sharp on each side , and a point to it . The prisoner gave the blow with great force , and took the knife out again himself . I believe , as near as I can guess , it went in about an inch and an half . Q . Did the deceased bleed much ? Austin . He bled the space of three minutes after he was stabb 'd , and died immediately . Q . Did the prisoner seem to intend this ? Austin . Yes , to be sure , because he did it wilfully and with good force . I never saw the prisoner or the deceased before this happened . Mary Wheeler . All that I can say about it is , that on the 2d of Sept . I was coming from my mistress 's door , and saw the deceased running after the prisoner ; - it was just by the Wheatsheas in the Fleet-market . The deceased said , You rogue , why do you cut me ? I did not hear the prisoner make any answer , but the deceased had a stick in his hand , and offered to strike at the prisoner with it . Q . Was that before the stab , or afterwards ? Wheeler . After the deceased had said , You rogue , why do you cut me ? he up with his hand directly , and before he could give a blow , the prisoner stabb 'd him . I know nothing either of the prisoner or the deceased . Q . Did you observe whether the deceased was cut when he said , why do you cut me ? Wheeler . I did not see that he was cut . Thomas Round . I was sitting at my stall in the Fleet-market , and hearing a noise , I rose up and went to the stone arch , and saw the prisoner with its knife in his hand . I looked at the deceased , and observed that his hand was all bloody . I spoke to the prisoner and said , you rogue , what do you do with that knife ? you have cut the man 's hand ! Immediately I turned my eye to the deceased , and saw him leaning forward with the wound in his breast , and an effusion of blood coming from him , as much as if a sheep or a lamb had been killed . I then turned to the prisoner , and said , you rogue , you villain , you have killed the man ! Upon that , he drew back to a coffin maker 's shop , and I came up to him , and bid him lay down his knife . Another person coming up , took hold of him , and he shoved the knife behind him and dropped it down the coffin maker 's cellar , from whence it was taken and delivered to the church-warden . Q . How did the prisoner behave when you took hold of him ? Round . All he had to say was , why did he strike me ? - I had no other answer from him . Francis Betterson . Hearing a noise at the back part of our shop , I went to see what was the matter , and saw the prisoner go on a pretty bandsomish pace , and the deceased followed him with a stick in his hand . I ran after them , and when I got half way down the market , the deceased struck the prisoner with his stick . There ensued a sort of a skirmish between them , and just as I came up , the prisoner stabb 'd him with a knife into the pit of the stomach . He bled pretty much on the ground , and died in a quarter of an hour , without speaking , as I heard . Q . You say the deceased was pursuing the prisoner ! Betterson . Yes , and the boys cried , Now Jack ! Now Jack ! and that aggravated him . Q . How long after the deceased struck the prisoner was the stab given ? Betterson . The deceased 's hand was up a second time , to strike the prisoner , as I thought , and then the stab was given . I never saw the prisoner before that time . Henry Snagdon . I was at breakfast on the 2d of Sept. and a message was brought to me that a man was killed in the Fleet-market . I went down , and saw the deceased lying on his back , and I did not perceive any life in him . His name was John Haddock . Mr . Round . He used to go by the name of Piper , but his true name was Haddock . Simon Snowd , Surgeon . On the 3d of the month aforesaid , I was sent for to open the body of the deceased on the coroner 's inquest . I found in the sternum a small wound , which penetrated into the breast . I found it necessary to open it , and when I had opened the breast , I found the cavity of the belly filled with blood ; and on examination of what we call the viscera , I found a wound in the heart of about an inch and an half , and it was impossible he should live above two or three minutes . William King . I saw the prisoner lie on his back , just against the Fleet-prison for about a minute : he turned himself short round , and got up , and pulled a knife out of his pocket . It seemed to have a paper upon it , and when he had untied it , he looked towards Fleet-street , and seeing no body there , he clapp 'd himself against a bulk , and rested himself in this manner . He held his knife by the side of his clothes , and the deceased came down with a design to take the knife from him . Accordingly he took the prisoner by the elbow , but missing his hold , the prisoner turned round , and cut him on the finger , and he bled violently . This was about three quarters after 8 in the morning , and in about 5 minutes I heard that the man was murder 'd . Prisoner . He struck me first , and I did it in my own defence . Guilty Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 30 . 31. William Westwood and Joseph Bellinger , of St. Mary White chappel , were indicted for assaulting Charles Butler in a certain alley , called Rosemary-branch-alley , near the King 's highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him 7 s. in money ; June 1 . Charles Butler . On the 1st of June last I met the prisoner Westwood and five others at the Hampshire Hog in Rosemary-lane : he was buying some fish , and I followed him into the house , to ask him for 40s . which he owed me . I call 'd for a pint of beer , and while the landlord was gone to draw it , Westwood told me , if I asked him for the money , he would swear me into a robbery , and he ran his cane into my mouth . I told him I would get a writ for him , and he said , I had no money , and could not ; upon which I shew 'd him a letter , wherein I had orders to go to Spithead to receive 22 l. 10s . I then left the house , and four of them followed me into the city , and after having arrested me , they dragg 'd me into Rosemary-branch-alley . They followed me into Rosemary-lane , and then the prisoner Bellinger came up with a piece of parchment in his hand , and said , I have got it . I took hold of Daniel Jones 's collar , to keep me from falling , and then they cut me on the head , and one of them ran his tipstaff into my eye . After this , Bellinger put his hand into my pocket , and pulled out six shillings and two sixpences . I cried out Murder ! and said I was robb 'd , and went to put my foot on some of my money that had dropp 'd on the ground , but Westwood came up and shoved my foot aside , and took it up . Then they used me so that blood came out of my nose and eyes . I was carried to the Infirmary , where I lay speechless and out of my senses for some time . My bleeding ca n't be stopp 'd , and I have been these 20 weeks , next Monday , under this calamity . Q . What was Westwood indebted to you for ? Butler . I am a bricklayer and fitted up his house inside and outside . Westwood 's Q . Have you not been in company with me several times since ? and have you ever charged me with this robbery ? Butler . I have seen him but once since : I did not charge him with the robbery because justice Phillips took bail for him . Q . Did you not attempt to get a warrant for him ? Butler . No ; I knew where he lived , but he absconded ( from ) his house . Westwood 's Q . Did not you charge me with assaulting you after the commission of the robbery ? Butler . No , I charged him with aiding and abetting in the robbery . Q . Which of you went first into the Hampshire Hog ? Butler . I went in first : Westwood was buying some fish at the door , and followed me in . They had no writ against me , and I owed no man any money . Westwood . How came you to put off the trial last sessions by an affidavit that yourself and another man were material Witnesses , and now no body appears but yourself ? Butler . The other man was a Bricklayer , but I had not timely notice that the Trial would come on . DEFENCE . Westwood . I am an officer belonging to the sheriff of Middlesex , and having obtained a writ against Butler , I desired these officers to arrest him for me . Accordingly they did arrest him , and he being obstropulous and not willing to go with them , they beat him and pulled and haled him about . He says I aided in beating and robbing him . I shall call William Walmsley to shew that I was not there . William Walmsley . I was standing over against the Rosemary-Branch ale house , and as soon as this tumult was raised , he went backwards into the house and I saw no more of him . Westwood 's Q . Can you take upon you to say whether I was along with them when the man was arrested ? Walmsley . I am sure he was not near them . Westwood . How long might they continue in the street ? Walmsley . About a quarter of an hour or half an hour the very most . Q . What became of them afterwards ? Walmsley . They were charged with the officers . I took Thomas Roberts myself . Pris . Q . Was there any talk of a robbery at this time ? Walmsley . No , I heard no complaint of any robbery at all . Butler fell down in the court on his back , and beat his head against the stones , which caused blood to come out of the back part of his head , and soon afterwards a doctor came and bled him . Q . Did you see what was done when Butler was dragg 'd up the alley ? Walmsley . Yes : there were Thomas Roberts , Daniel Jones , and Bellinger . Jones had hold of one of Butler 's legs , Roberts another , and Bellinger had hold of his collar and his hand . Q . Did you stay there any Time after Bellinger had him by the collar ? Walmsley . No , I did not stay a minute because I had a shop to mind and was afraid of losing my goods . Q . Where did you go after that ? Walmsley . To my shop door , about ten or fifteen yards off . Q . Could you see there what was done at the back of the Rosemary-Branch alehouse ? Walmsley . No , I was not able to do that to be sure . - Wood . I keep the Rosemary Branch alehouse , and remember this dispute . Westwood was in my house when the mob came past . He said they had arrested a man , and it was strange they could not arrest a man without beating him . The bailiffs then had Butler hold by the arm and dragg 'd him through the alley . Westwood never came out of my house for the space of half an hour . There were not two of the mob then left , and Butler was gone to the Infirmary . As to the robbery , Westwood robb 'd him no more than I did I believe , for I heard nothing at all said of a robbery . Isabella Seers . I live in Cock alley , and was waiting on Mr. Wood 's children , and remember the day that Butler was arrested . Mr. Westwood came in about 2 minutes before the mob came past the door , and called for a pint of beer . When the mob came round to the back door they said there was a man arrested , and the man fell down in the court . Mr. Wood then put Westwood into a back parlour , and locked him in , and he staid there 'till the man was gone to the Infirmary . Q . Why did Wood lock the prisoner in ? Seers . Because the mob said they would knock his brains out . I was binding a silk petticoat and he sat best part of the time that I was doing it . I never heard a word of a robbery . Q . What time of the day was this ? Seers . Between 1 and 2 , we were just going to dinner . Matthew Crawley . I serve Mr. Wood with bread . I brought him a loaf , and saw the mob coming just by the door . I got as fast as I could into the house , and saw Wood and Westwood talking together in the room , and I staid there two hours 'till all was dispersed . Westwood Q . Did I go out 'till all was over ? Crawley . No , he did not indeed . Westwood 's Q . Had I any opportunity to go out to rob a man ? Crawley . No , he was in presence of me all the time . Q . Did you go into the room where he was lock 'd in ? Crawley . No , but I had the command of the Door in my eye that he could not go out . After I had been in the house some time , I had a fancy to see the mob , and I went as far as the pump and came back again , and saw Westwood where I left him . Westwood 's Q . Could , I when you was out of the room , rob a man without your seeing me ? Crawley . No , he could not . Mary Battersey . I live in Rosemary Lane , and hearing a tumult that the officers had hurt the man , I desired them to raise him up against the wall : they did so , and a gentlewoman gave me some wine to give him , and I put my finger in his mouth to see if he could drink , but he could not . After this his wife came , and took a handkerchief off her neck and put it about his cut head : she took money out of his pocket several times , and put it into her bosom , and I myself lent her a great pin to pin her gown to prevent her losing the money . I never saw either of the prisoners there , nor ever heard the least syllable of a robbery . Clifford William Phillips Esq . Colonel Deacon had the 4 bailiffs before him after this assault was committed , and he sent them to the Tower goal for farther examination . The next day he sent for me to join with him in taking the examination : The assault appeared to be a very violent one , and we committed the 4 bailiffs to Newgate . Butler being in the Infirmary in the parish where I live , and being told he was like to die , I went thither to take his examination . The doctors reported to me that he had been speechless all night , but that he was now come to his senses , so I took my clerk into the room and bid him take the examination exactly as he spoke it , and I would come in when he had done , for I did not like the stench of the place . When it was done , I came in , and found that he had charged Westwood with thrusting his cane into his mouth at the alehouse . ( which was some time before the arrest ) and likewise that he had charged Bellinger with robing him . Seeing Westwood charged only in this manner , I asked Butler whether he was concern 'd in this cruel usage ? he told me he was not . Upon this I granted a warrant against Bellinger , but Westwood came voluntarily , and I took bail for the assault . This is the examination and this is Butler 's hand : it was read over to him very distinctly and he was very sensible when he sign 'd it . The examination was read , the substance of which was , that between the hours of 11 and 12 he ( Butler ) met with William Westwood and 4 others at the Hampshire Hog in Rosemary Lane ; that he asked Westwood for the money that he ow 'd him : that Westwood replied he would pay this deponent when he was going to Tyburn : that this deponent saying those were not expressions fit for a married man as he was , Westwood ran his cane against his mouth ; and then this deponent paid three half pence for a pint of beer which he had call 'd for and said he would get a writ for him . That he ( this deponent ) then went away , and going past the Merchant Taylors alms houses , some persons came up to him and said , your journey is stopped ; that a person said hold of this deponent , and they saying they had no action to produce , he ( this deponent ) knock 'd his head in his face . That one of the 4 persons struck this deponent in the eye with a tipstaff , and another gave him a blow on his head . That one of them said , d - n your limbs , where have you been this great while ? and pulling out a yellow piece of parchment with a red seal to it , all the 5 persons pull 'd and haled this deponent into a narrow alley , and that Daniel Jones tripp 'd him up . That this deponent got up again , and laid hold of Daniel Jones 's collar : upon which Bellinger said , undo his hands . That then Bellinger came up , and put one hand to this deponent 's collar , and the other into his pocket , and took out his money . That one of the 5 persons knock 'd this deponent down ; that another said d - n him he is resty , he will not go : that they haled him so far that he was deprived of his senses , and that Westwood said , bale him away , dead or alive , for go he shall : & c. Mr. Philips . He said that Westwood came out of Wood 's house while he was in this condition , and said he should be taken away , but he had no concern in the money . Edward King . I was in the room when Butler gave the information to justice Philips , and he never mention 'd any robbery against Westwood . I had 2 warrants to serve upon the prisoners . I was 3 days and 3 nights looking after Bellinger , but Westwood I took presently . I went to see Butler several times in the Infirmary , and once while I was there his wife was sitting on the side of the bed by him . She call 'd him forsworn son of a b - h , and said she took the money out of his pocket herself , he d - d her and bid her hold her tongue , and hearing this I surrender 'd up the warrants into another officer 's hands . Mary Wright . When this hurley-burley was , I like a great many more fools must go and see it , and I saw Butler 's wife put her handkerchief about his neck , and take the money out of his pocket . Mrs. Battersey held one arm and I held the other while he was blooded , and he never complained of a robbery . Mr. Deacon gave an account that he committed the 4 bailiss to Newgate for this abuse ; and that afterwards by a certificate from the doctor and apothecary of the Infirmary that Butler was out of danger , he took bail for them . That Westwood was one of their bail , and that Butler was present and made no mention of any robbery committed by him . Both acquitted . 32.

The candlesticks , snuffers and stand I sold to Mr. Lee , and my brother desired her to sell the coffee-pot ; and she took it out , and said she had sold it to Mr. Brown , on the other side of the water . Counc . Did she know it was stolen ? Ramsey . Yes , Sir . Counc . How did she know it was stolen ? Ramsey . She knew we went out to steal , and we told her we stole these things from Mr. Glyn 's .

Pris . Q . Was not I a servant in the family ? Ramsey . No , she lived entirely with my brother . He kept her , and the money she gave to him to keep house with . The record of Ramsey 's conviction was read . Thomas Pow . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury : I have known the prisoner 9 or 10 years , and to my certain knowledge she had a very good character .

I went to the prisoner 's house ; he lives with one Nan Thompson in Turnbull-street ; I told him I lived with my father in Bell-court , Brooks-market , and we agreed to take any thing from thence that we could get , to buy pistols , in order to go upon the highway . It was agreed between us , that I should go to bed , to prevent suspicion in the family , and that I should tie a string about my wrist , and let it hang out of the window , which he was to pull to wake me . He came that very night , but could not find the string ; so he appointed to come the next night . Accordingly I tied the string about my wrist the second time , but he was ( as he afterwards told me ) so drunk , that he could not find the way . We made the same appointment a third time , and he came . I was awake at the window , and let down the two coats mentioned in the indictment with the cord of the bed . We sold the coats for about 25 or 26 s. out of which we had 5 or 6 s. apiece , and the rest we laid by to buy a pair of pistols . Robert Morris .

John Mangar . I live in Maiden-lane , Covent-Garden . On the 19th of Sept. about half an hour after eight at night , I had left off work , and was informed , that my clothes were stolen . I ran into the street , and saw them set down in the street , about two doors beyond my house . My apprentice pursued the prisoner till he was taken . Thomas Low . When I went down stairs from work , I heard a noise in the parlour . I turned into the shop to shut it up , and just as I opened the shop door , I saw the prisoner go out with the basket on his knee . I ran after him , and asked him what business he had with the basket ? He made me no answer , but walked a door or two farther . I then took hold of the basket , and asked him again , and a fellow that stood over against him said , You are not right . Upon this the prisoner set down the basket , and he and the other man walked very leisurely till they came to Southampton-street . Then they ran into the Strand , and some people coming to my assistance , the prisoner was taken in a street just by Exeter-Change . I am sure he is the man , for he was not out of my sight 'till he was taken . Prisoner . Please to ask him , if he saw me in the house , why he did not have me taken sooner ? Low . Because he was just at the street door when I opened it . Prisoner . Did not he say I must be the person because I had a white coat on ? Low . No , I said no such thing , because all the way I went I looked in his face . Edward Hide . On Saturday the 19th of Sept. between 8 and 9 at night , this woman and I were sitting at the Horse and Groom door , in Maiden-lane , and the prisoner came by with a basket of linen in his hand . Low followed him pretty close , and he set the basket down , and walked on very leisurely . Low cried , Stop thief ! and as soon as he came to the end of Southampton-street , he set up his heels and ran . Melicent James . We were sitting at the Horse and Groom door , and heard the boy cry stop-thief ! The prisoner set the basket down and ran away . I pursued him , and got hold of the lappet of his coat , but he hit my hand a blow , and got away from me . Charles Class . I was going up Burleigh-street , and met the prisoner . I clapp 'd my hand upon him , and stopp 'd him . He had on a light-colour 'd coat and a woollen apron , like a tradesman . When I had secured him , Low came up , and we carried him to Justice Frazier , and the boy ( Low ) was very positive to him . William Reddish . I live pretty near where the prisoner was taken , and being a constable , I was called to their assistance . I went up into Southampton-street , and found the prisoner in custody of the last witness . We carried him to Justice Frazier 's , an d being apprehensive of a rescue , we desired a guard , but it was refused . We got him down to White-hall , and assistance came ; but a body of people fallied out upon us , and rescued the prisoner . He was retaken by a serjeant , and I have a nephew whose skull was broke in the rescue , and I believe he will never get over it . Prisoner . I was coming that way , and saw the basket of clothes , and the boy took hold of me , and let me go again . He bid me cry stop thief , and I ran with the rest of the people . I saw them lay hold of several people , and at last they laid hold of me , and said I must be the man , because I had a white coat on . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 51.

John Baker . I live at Mr. North 's in Grosvenor-square . On the 23d of July I went out of town , and left my money safe in the bureau , and when I came home , the same night , I found the bureau broke open , and burnt , and my money gone . Catharine Smith . All these things are mine . I went out of town before this happened , and left all my drawers lock 'd up safe and when I returned , these things had been taken away , but were brought in again . Elizabeth Pitties . I am about twelve years old . That woman in the blue cloak , her name is Mary Reynolds , she in the middle is Jane Laws , and the other is James Reynolds , I came from Hampshire last Christmas , to live with my aunt . Mary Reynolds sells apples , and I got acquainted with her by buying fruit of her . Before my aunt went to take care of Mr. North 's house , she lived in Jolly 's court , a little distance from the prisoner 's . When I came to town this last time , Mary Reynolds was very glad to see me , and when I had drank tea with her several times , she ask 'd me if my aunt had no clothes that I could bring her : I told her my aunt had none . Then she heard that my aunt had the care of Mr. North 's house , and she ask 'd me to let them in to take some things away : she said it was not the first time she had been in houses in that manner , that I need not be afraid , and if I would not let her in , she would tell my aunt that I had ask 'd her to come and rob the house . At last I agreed to let them in , and Reynolds and his wife came one Wednesday morning . Mr. Baker went out of town that morning in a chaise , to carry a puppy , and they waited about the door 'till he and my aunt went out . Then I let them in , and after they were in the house , they bid me shew them where the money was : I said I believ 'd there was none except there was any in Mr. Baker 's bureau , which was in the house-keeper 's room . They went into the room , and James Reynolds pull 'd the bolt of a window out of his pocket and broke open the bureau : he was dress 'd in a frock and sleeves like a tradesman , and Mary Reynolds was with him . When he had broke the bureau open , he took from thence three moidores , and bid me give them to his wife . I had one , she had one , and Laws had one . Q . How do you know that Laws had one ? was she in the house ? Pitties . No , but I saw Mrs. Reynolds give her one the next day . After they had taken the money , they went up into the lady 's woman 's room , and James Reynolds broke open the drawers with the same thing that he broke open the bureau with . He took out the stay and the gown and gave them to his wife ; but before this , he told me he would kill me if I did not set fire to the papers in the bureau to prevent discovery , so I was forced to do it . After the papers were lighted I shut the lid of the bureau , and then they went up stairs and took the other things . Mary Reynolds came by herself once afterwards : I was then washing the tea cups in the kitchen , and my aunt was in the parlour at work : she went up the back stairs , but I ca n't tell whether she took any thing then . They wanted more things , and they said they would have more , and I was afraid they would come again for more , for Mr. Baker had made a stir about being robb 'd , and they told me if I said they were concern 'd , I should hang myself and clear them , but if I took it all upon myself I should be saved ; and when I was in Bridewell , before I went to the justice , James Reynolds came to me , and desired me not to bring him in . Q . When you let these people into the house , who was at home ? Pitties . No body at all but myself . My aunt went out to the milliner 's about 8 in the morning , and came back about eleven . Dorothy Pitties . I went out between 8 and 9 , and when I came home at eleven I smelt fire , and after some examination I found it was in Mr. Baker 's bureau . I left no body in the house but the girl when I went out . Pris . James . Ask the girl if I broke any locks , or carried any thing away with me ? Eliz . Pitties . Yes . He broke open the bureau , and afterwards went into Mrs. Smith 's room , and broke the chest of drawers open , and he tried to break the lady 's cabinet open , but he could not . Prisoners . How long have you been acquainted with us ? Pitties . About two years and half : I came acquainted with them by buying fruit . Mary Reynolds kept an apple stall at the top of Ivy Bridge . Q . Had Laws any of the goods ? Pitties . Yes , I saw Mrs. Reynolds give her these things for her share . Catharine Shorter . I bought this gown of Mary Reynolds , some time in August , but I ca n't tell the day . - Rossiter . I am turnkey of Tothill Bridewell . On the 26th of August this girl was committed to my care , and the prisoner James came in to see her , and desir 'd her not to bring him in . Pris . James . That fellow was as drunk as muck , and could not stand : I desired her to speak the truth , let her deny it if she can . Francis Libertine , John Smith , Benjamin Fulford , William Brown , Philip Gardiner , Jonathan Hall and colonel Ogilby gave James Reynolds the character of an honest man . John Ward appeared to the character of Mary Reynolds , and Hugh Phillips , William Brown , Hannah Smedley , Benjamin Birch , John Spencer , John Holes , and Howel Hughes to that of Laws , and never heard but that they were honest industrious women . A Witness . This is the examination of Elizabeth Pitties : It was all read over to her in my presence , and she sign 'd it . Elizabeth Pitties . This is my hand writing .
