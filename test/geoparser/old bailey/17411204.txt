November 6 , a Weather Sheep , Value 10s . the Property of Robert Flexmore , feloniously and wilfully they did kill , with Intent to steal the same , against the Form of the Statute , & c. Daniel Hawkins . On Sunday Morning , the 18th of last Month , I sent my Servant into my Grounds to fetch up eighteen Sheep ; I did design to go to Smithfield with two Calves , so I thought I would take some Sheep with me . My Servant brought but seventeen , and told me one was missing ; upon which , I told them myself , and thinking perhaps I might get it again , I obtained a Warrant from Justice Clitherow to search for it . I had some Suspicion of Dean , and Flexmore 's Father ; and I went to Dean 's House , and after we had examined him , and his House pretty rightly , he confessed that he , Daniel Hawkins , and John Flexmore , went out on the Friday Night , and drove the Sheep up into a Corner , and kill 'd it , and then carried it Home to Flexmore 's House , Upon this , we went to Robert Flexmore 's enquiry , and at the Top of the House the Constable found something wrapp 'd up , which proved to be a Leg of Mutton . I brought Dean behind me to Town , and told him he had as good tell me what he had done with the Skin , and he said , Master we threw it into a Cart-rut ; and the next Day I sent my Boy , and he pulled the Skin out of the Rut , with a Fork : It was in a by-lane where Carts do not go sometimes for two Months . He found the Skin and shewed it to me , but I ca n't swear it was mine , for it was cut into ten Pieces I believe . - Westmore , Constable . Mr. Hawkins brought the Search Warrant to me , and I went to search Dean 's House . I took him upon Suspicion , and when we had him out of Doors , he confessed that he , with the two Flexmore 's went into Hawkins 's Ground 's on the Friday Night before , killed the Sheep there , and brought it home in a Sack . Q . Did you hear Robert Flexmore say any Thing ? Westmore . When Mr. De Veil examined him , he said , he was one of them : I never heard him say any Thing more than that . Hawkins . Flexmore said in my hearing , that they went out about ten or eleven at Night , and that he was with his Father and Dean when the Sheep was killed . John Flexmore . I am Brother to Flexmore 's Mother , and I never heard no Harm of him in my Life . John Francis . I know Samuel Dyson very well ; he lived with me three Years as a Servant , and always did what I commanded him without making Words , and I believe it was through his Father that he did that Act that he did . John Flexmore . Flexmore lived with me ; and as for Dean , he was a Neighbour , but I can say nothing to him . I never saw any other than Honesty by Flexmore , all the Time he lived with me . Dean guilty Death . Flexmore Acquitted . 4. George Watson , was indicted for privately stealing a Guinea , a half Guinea , a Moidore , and 1 l. 7 s. the Money of Jane Benfield , from his Person , October 20 . William Herne . About five or six Weeks ago I had been out about some Business , and had drank too much , and the Prisoner enticed me from Place to Place , to go to her Lodging with her . Accordingly she took me to a House in Rag-Fair , and there picked my Pocket while I lay backwards on the Bed . Q . Why did not you seize her ? Herne . It was two or three Hours afterwards before I could , for she ran out of the House . My Money was in three Papers , and I had put it into a Bag to pay three Persons that I dealt with . Q . What Business are you ? Herne . I am Master of a small Vessel , and trade from London to Ipswich ; and this Money I brought from Ipswich to pay away - I have never had it again . Prisoner . I was going through Rag Fair for a Pound of Mutton Stakes , and met the Prosecutor , he was pulling some Women about , and me among the rest . I asked him what he wanted ? he said so and so , and went to be rude with me , but I got from him . He watched me Home , and I was no sooner got up Stairs but he followed me , and swore he would lie with me . There was another Woman in the Room , whom he desired to fetch a full Pot of Beer . I told him I would go myself , and he gave me a Shilling , and I brought him the Change . Herne . There was another Woman in the Room , but the Prisoner was the Person that did the Fact , and we never had any Drink , or any Thing at all . Acquitted . 5 , 6.

At the Prisoner 's Desire the Witnesses were examined apart . Wm Blackburn . On Sunday Morning the first of last Month , a little before one o'Clock , I was going up towards Islington , and very near Sadler 's Wells back Gate , he in the blue grey Coat and red Waistcoat ( Warner ) came up to me with a Hanger in his Hand . Pris . Warner . He swore before the Justice , that I had the Pistol . Blackburn . Another came up , whom I take to be the other Prisoner , with a Horse Pistol in his Hand , and they damn 'd me , and bid me deliver my Money . I dropped my Watch in the Grass , thinking to save it , and I had a Bottle of Brandy on my left Side , and Warner took it out of my Pocket , and the other took 5 s and two Box Keys . Warner happen 'd to see my Watch lie in the Field , and he said , D - n me Jack , here , I have got his Watch ! come along Jack ! and then I saw them go along the Field together , and presently I saw a Man lying at length , and heard him cry O Dear ! Upon that one of them said , he had a good Mind to turn again and shoot him through the Head , and the other said , he deserved his Brains blown out , and they would do it . I passed them , and went up to 'Squire Edward 's Brewhouse , at the Woolpack , for some of their Men to come and see what was the Matter with the Man , and while I was there the Man himself ( William Blackburn ) came up . Q . What Sort of a Night was this ? Blackburn . A Star light Night . Q . Could you distinguish the Persons ? Blackburn Yes , very well . Prisoner Warner . How came you to take us up ? Blackburn . I described their Persons , and on the Tuesday following they were taken on Suspicion of House-breaking , and sent to the Gate-house , where we saw them . - They were both taken up on the Tuesday , and Warner only was sent to the Gatehouse , and we saw him there the next Day . Q . What is your Employment ? Blackburn , I am Servant to Mr. Forcer , and have lived with him three Years , and the Night this happened , I had been at Goodman's-Fields to a Benefit there . Q . How were the Persons dressed that robbed you : Blackburn . Warner was in the same Dress as he is in now , but Newman was not . Prisoner Newman . The Almanack will convince these People that it was a dark Night . Here is a Frock , and he swore I had not a Frock on . This is a Frock . Q . What , that which you had on then ? Newman . Yes my Lord ; he saw me in Goal in this Frock . Ask him whether it was not a dark Night ? Blackburn . It was between twelve and one in the Morning , and Star-light . Charles Shippey . The two Prisoners met me , and knock 'd me down , and after I had recovered myself , I walk 'd to Mr. Edwards 's Brewhouse , and there I saw Blackburn . He said , he had been robb 'd , and I told him , I believed they had broke my Skull , but I would go back and see for my Meat and Potatoes . After they had robbed me , Warner said , here comes another , and I turned my Head as quick as he spoke , and saw Mr. Blackburn in his white Apron , and he told me , he had lost his Watch , and five Shillings , a Half penny , a Pocket-piece , and a Quart of Brandy . Q . How long was that after they had robbed you ? Shippey . Not two Minutes . Q . Was it in the same Place ? Shippey . I believe it was ten or twelve Yards distant . Q . Were they in the Place where Blackburn was robbed ? Shippey . Yes , they ran from me to him . Warner ran first , and as he was going along , I took him a Drive to knock him down , and I hurt my Hand in two Places . He had a Horse-Pistol in his Hand , and when I took him that Blow , Newman knock 'd me down again ; I ca n't tell with what , for I lay senseless . Q . Where they the Persons that robbed you ? Shippey . Yes , Warner came up to me , and ran his Pistol to my Breast : I said , Friend , I have nothing about me worth your taking . He put his Hand into one Pocket and found nothing , but in my other Pocket , I had three Shillings , which he took from me , and I believe he would not have taken my Meat , if I had not struck him . Q . Was this before Blackburn was robb 'd ? Shippey . Yes , as soon as he had taken the three Shillings out of my Pocket , he said , here comes another , and I turned my Head , and saw a Man in a white Apron ; so I took him a Knock , and thought I would have another when Blackburn came up , imagining he might take my Part ; but they knocked me down , and immediately went up to him , and the last Words I heard them say , were , D - his B - d , I have a good Mind to go back and shoot him through the Brains , for he deserves it . It was a Star-light Night , and the Watch were going Twelve when we came through Wood 's Close . Q . When did you see them afterwards ? Shippey . Warner was sent to the Gatehouse , and Newman to Bridewell , and there I saw them the Wednesday following . Newman . Please to see whether it was a Starlight Night . Shippey . It was a Star-light Night . Warner . Did it Rain ? Shippey . No . Warner . I hope you will look into it , and see whether it did or no . Charles Shippey . I know no more than that I have seen the two Prisoners together Day and Night . - I am a Marshal 's Court Officer . Warner . He is a Thief-taker . Revington . Mr. Blackburn was at our House , and left Word that he wanted to speak with me , and when I saw him , he informed me he had been robbed by a Man in a blue grey Coat , and another in a brown Frock . Afterwards hearing that these Men were taken , I desired him to go and look at them , and I went with him and Shippey , and they were positive to the Men . I have seen them frequently in the Street passing and repassing in the Night-time . Q . What Business had you up in the Night-time ? Revington . I have attacked some of their Kind before . Jury . Was there a mix 'd Company when Blackburn picked them out at the Gatehouse ? Revington . I was not directly in , because Warner threw a Pipe at me , and swore he would do me a Mischief , but there were several Prisoners about . Q . Did any body shew the Man to Blackburn ? Revington . No , he challenged him himself . Q . To Blackburn . Did any Body point out Warner to you ? Blackburn . No , I just look 'd at him , and he said D - n your Eyes , you Rogue , what do you look at me for ? I saw Newman in Tothillfields Bridewell ; Revington was with me , and I found him out myself . DEFENCE . Charles Revington . I am a Shoemaker by Trade , and have kept the Coach and Horses in Hog-Lane , St. Giles 's , a Quarter of a Year at Christmas . I have known Newman two Years and something better . He is a Bricklayer by Trade , and lived in the same House with me in Newport Market : that was two Years ago , and I have not been much in his Company since then , but I never knew any Harm of the Man . I used to make Shoes for him . Q . Do you know Warner ? Thomas Blackburn . Yes , they were at my House together the Sunday Morning this was sworn to be done . I took Notice of it , because he said it was the first of October , and they were at my House then . C. That happens to be a Month before the Robbery . Warner . My Witnesses will not be here till To-morrow . Newman . Examine whether it was a Star-light Morning or no . I have no Money , and therefore ca n't get any Body else to appear for me . Both Guilty . Death . 7. Thomas Blackburn , of St. Clement Danes , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 3 l. 4 Pieces of foreign Gold , value 7 l. 4 s. 2 Moidores , and 9 Guineas , from the Person of Esther Burnham , Nov. 30 . And , 8. John Bowers , for receiving the same , knowing them to be stolen . Godfrey Nodder . Last Monday Night between 9 and 11 at Night , I was going round the Back Side of St. Clement 's , and I went with a Woman into this Burnham 's House . It is a House where they sell Drams , and I thought it was kept by another Person . I dismissed the Woman whom I had with me , and went towards the Fire-side , and turned up the Flap of my Waistcoat , and saw my Watch was there . The Prisoner then desired me to go with her into the Passage just by the Door , and we had not been there above three Minutes before she picked my Pocket of my Watch , and she gave me a Shove and ran into the House . I followed her , and just as I came to the Door , John Bowers the other Prisoner , met me , and gave me a push away till she made her Escape . Finding she was gone , and not being willing to lose my Watch , I said in the public Room , I would give any Body a Guinea to have my Watch again , and no Questions asked . Upon this she came down Stairs rectly , and I pulled out my Purse to have Change for Half a Guinea : She seeing my Purse , called me into another Room , and I thinking to have my Watch again , went into the Room with her , and there she picked my Pocket of my Purse and Gold . I missed it that very Minute , and ran after her and caught her . I came to Town on the Sunday Night before , and brought this Money with me , and was pretty much fuddled when this happened . I seized the Prisoner a second Time , and Nodder came and struggled with me , and she got away again . I ca n't tell what Nodder is ; I never saw him before that Night , but I can swear to them both . I saw there was nothing to be done , so I went to call Assistance , and got Mr. Roach and Mr. Sumner to go with me , and with some Difficulty we got into the House . We went into a Room and found the Prisoner , and seeing Nodder 's Hat and Wig lying on the Chest of Drawers , we asked her where her Husband ( Nodder ) was ? She said he was gone out , but after we had set a Watch about the House , we went into the next Room , and there was Nodder by the Fire Side . He robb 'd his Eyes as if he had been asleep , and Godfrey Nodder found the Watch in the Chimney by him . Then they search 'd in the Fire Place , and found some 36 s. Pieces , two Moidores , and 3 Guineas . Q . How do you know they were yours ? Bowers . I am sure as to the Watch , but it is a hard Matter to swear to the Money . I told the Constable and all of them , what Pieces I had lost before they went to search . These Things were not found upon Nodder , but in the Fire Place by him , and on searching him we found a Purse and some Money in his Pocket . I ca n't swear that they were mine , but he said he had pawned his Hat and Wig for 2 s. just before . Pris . Burnham . Ask him if there were not two Women that came with him , and sat by the Fire Side . Bowers . One Woman I brought in , but her I dismissed . Burnham . How do you know but that Woman might take your Things ? Bowers . Because I chang 'd my Money after she had been gone some Time . Pris . Nodder . Ask him if I mislefted ( molested ) him in any Shape , or meddled with him good , bad , or indifferent ? Bowers . Once I had her in my Custody and he hinder 'd me . Nodder . Did not I tell him he might go and see if there was any Woman there ? Bowers . He said I might go down into the Cellar and see . Robin Roach . I am a Robe maker , and happen 'd to call in at this House to see for my Bed-fellow , because I knew he was drunk that Afternoon , and he used to keep Company with a loose Woman that used that House . At Nodder 's Desire I sat down by the Fire Side about two Minutes , and the Coachman ( Bowers ) came and sat down on the other Side of the Fire . He sat about a Minute , and went out again , and Burnham and he were both missing . After they had been out two Minutes , or something more , I heard some Body run up Stairs very fast . There was a Screen by the Fire , and I could not see whether any Body went out with him , but he came in presently , and said she had robb 'd him of his Watch . Nodder said there was no Body come in there , Bowers insisted that there was , and upon that Nodder wanted to let him out at the Passage Door to see for her there . Bowers would have it , that she was gone up Stairs , upon which Nodder took a Candle off the Counter , and went up Stairs , but would not let him go into the one pair of Stairs Room , because ( he said ) they must be gone up higher . I went up to the one pair of Stairs , but Nodder and the Prosecutor went up higher , and when they came down again , the Prosecutor pulled out a Guinea on the Counter , and said he would give it for his Watch . Immediately Burnham came down , and he told her she had got his Watch , and he would give her a Guinea to let him have it again . He called for a Quartern of Shrub , and had Change for half a Guinea : she seeing his Money said , Come hither my Dear , I want to speak with you ! Upon which they went backwards , and staid very near a Quarter of an Hour , and then I heard her run out crying , D - ye if I will be served so . He follow 'd her , and said she had got his Money . Nodder said , no Body had got his Money ; but however I saw the Prosecutor bring her into the House by one Arm , and Nodder and he had a great Struggle , and got her from him . Then the Coachman ( the Prosecutor ) went out to see for his Friends , and Nodder fasten 'd up the Door . I did not care to stay in the House any longer , so I bid Nodder give me a Dram , and let me go out . He was very unwilling to let me go , but at last he did ; and when I came out , I saw the Prosecutor and Roach together While we were talking together , I happen 'd to see this young Woman that my Shop mate keeps Company with . Nodder had refused to let us in again , so she open 'd the Door for us , and when we came in we found the Prisoner Burnham a Bed , and I saw the Watch found in the Chimney , and the Money in the Ashes . Burnham . How long has he known me ? Sumner . I never saw her but once before that Sunday Night . Burnham . Did he see me go into any Company with the Coachman ? Sumner . No , Nodder came up to me as I sat in the Watch-house , and said , if I would keep silent , his Wife should make me a Present . Nodder . Ask him whether I used the Coachman ill ? Sumner . Yes , he got the Woman away from him . Elias Sumner . I live at the Lamb-Inn , the Back of St. Clement 's , within five Doors of the Prisoner 's House , and my Servant being gone to see what was the Matter , I went to fetch him Home , but being acquainted with the Coachman , I staid to assist him . The House was beset with Watchmen , and the Door in the Passage was bolted , but we got it opened , and when we came in , we saw Nodder in the Room below Stairs : He rubbed his Eyes and yawn 'd , and ask 'd what was the Matter The Prosecutor said , he had been robbed , and on searching the House , I found this Watch on the Edge of a Brick between the Closet and the Chimney , and in the Chimney Corner I found four Broad Pieces , and three Guineas . Bowers . This Watch is mine , it was made by one Davis . Roach . Nodder stood by me when I found these , and he bid me look in the Fire , so I took the Poker and stirred the Fire , and found two Moidores , and two Guineas more . After I had found the Watch in the Chimney , I began to look for the Money , and Nodder desired to speak with me in private , and he said , If I would disperse the Watchmen , the Money should be forth coming . I told him , we must have it now , but he said , there were some Females concerned in it , and they were the Devil to deal with . Burnham . Did not I desire to be stripp 'd and search 'd ? Roach . No , she did not . Robert Roach . On Monday Evening about eleven o'Clock , or a small Time before , John Bower came to my House , and told me he had been robbed : The Robe-maker ( Sumner ) came by at the same Time , and we got him to go along with us . We got two Watchmen to stand and secure the Fore-door , and then a Woman came by that used the House , and by her Means we got in . When we had got in , we went into the back Room , and found Burnham a bed , and on going into another Room , we saw Nodder sitting by the Fire-side , as if he had been asleep , and he pretended to be ignorant of our Business . We searched about , and at last my Brother found the Watch in the Chimney , and among some Dirt there were four thirty-six Shilling Pieces and some Guineas found . I took particular Notice of them , because Williams took them out , and he being a Stranger , I imagined he might Pocket some . Samuel Roach confirm 'd the above Deposition , with Regard to the finding the Prosecutor 's Money . Burnham . The Prosecutor came into our House with two Women , and had some Shrub , and changed Half a Guinea for it . They sat some Time , and at last went away together , and some time afterwards he came in again , and charged me with robbing him of his Watch . It is something very particular , that this Man should lose his Watch , be gone from me , and say I robb 'd him , and afterwards fuster me to take his Money . I should be glad to know what Freedom there was between us . Bowers . There was going to be a pretty deal of Freedom , but I lost it in the mean Time . Mary Lane . I live in Peter street , St. James 's . I lived with Mrs. Burnham last Summer , and I was in her Family before I lived with her . On Monday last in the Evening , I believe it might be something after eight o'Clock , I saw the Door open , I happened to be coming along , and dropped in there , and saw Mr. Nodder in the Shop . - I knew him before , for he lodged with her when I was her Servant . She keeps a Shop , and sells Liquor , - I do n't know what , - common Liquor , - Gin I believe ; but however , this Coachman came in , - he had a laced Hat on then , and he asked for one Mrs. Shaw . He was drunk , and two Women followed him in , and one of them sat in his Lap . He went out , and when he returned , he said , he had been robbed , and I am sure the Prisoner was not in his Company a Crum of a Minute . He accused me first , and when Mrs. Burnham came , he accused her ; but before he went away , he desired to have a Dram , and be Friends . I know two or three of the People that were there ; you , Sir , I knew for one , and this Man in his own Hair was another , and I will take another of you if that be all ( to Roach ) you told me , if I offered to appear you would hang me , and the Beadle of the Parish said the same . Q . Do you imagine the other Woman robb 'd Bowers ? Lane . Yes , I fancy so . Q . And left the Watch and Money for some body else ? Lane . I ca n't tell as to that . Arthur Williams lived with a Relation of mine at Chelsea , about a Year ago , and I never heard that she wrong 'd any Body . Elizabeth Bett Burnham . I know but little of Burnham , but Nodder I have known about a dozen Years , and never heard any Body accuse him of any Thing of this Kind . He kept a Public-House in Fleet Street a little while ago . - I have heard that he stood on the Pillory , but not till within this Month . Roach . Lane was in the House , and behaved in a very insolent Manner , and we desired the Justice to commit her to Bridewell , but he would not commit any Body that might be a Witness for the Prisoners . Burnham . They said before the Justice , that I should keep my Christmas in another World , for they were determined to hang me . Mr. De Viel . These Gentlemen said no such Thing as she charges them with , and Lane was the most impudent Creature that I ever saw , and the Reason I did not commit her , was , because she was to be an Evidence for the Prisoners . Burnham guilty Death . Nodder acquitted . 9 Robert Morris was indicted for stealing 20 Yards of green Baize , Value 20 s. the Goods of Joseph Holdsworth , November 18 , Guilty . [ Transportation .

Nov. 23 . Martha Tapster . It will be a Fortnight next Monday . I was coming from my Lady King 's in Bloomsbury-Square , about half an Hour past nine at Night , and was met by three Women and a Man in Little-Turnstile , near the Six Canns in Holborn . One of them struck me on the Side of the Face , and the other swore , D - her a B - knock her down , and immediately one of them fore my Cloak off my Shoulders . I turn 'd the Corner , and saw Martha Tapster standing at an Oyster Stall , and desir 'd her to help me . She said she knew the People that had robb 'd me , and would shew me next Morning where they lived . Upon this I went into the Six Canns , and the Maid stood at the Door with a Quart of Beer for them , but they ran away without drinking it . Susan Hawkins . About half an Hour past nine , the Prisoner Waters came to my Door , and call 'd for a Pot of Beer ; I keep the Six Canns in Holbourn . My Maid was not so quick in drawing it as she should have been , and so I went myself , and I heard a Woman say , D - you do n't stay for the Beer , but come along . He immediately went away from me towards the Cloaths Shop by Little Turnstile without drinking the Beer , and presently afterwards the Prosecutrix came up and said , she had been robb 'd of her Cloak . Eliz . Waters . The Prisoner Waters keeps a Lodging House in Goldsmith's-Alley , and his Wife having lent a Gown to one who had lodg 'd with him , he and his Wife , and I , and the two Prisoners went to see for it . It will be a Fortnight next Monday ; I really ca n't tell what Time of Night it was , but I believe it was between eight and nine o'Clock . They got pretty much in Liquor at the Woman 's House in Black Boy-Alley in Chick-Lane , and as we were coming by Mr. Ward 's Door , Waters said he would have a Pot of Beer ; his Wife thought he had had enough , and was for getting him along . The Prosecutrix happen 'd then to come by , and looked at us . I asked her what she look 'd at ? and she said something , I ca n't tell what it was , and I struck her on the Side of the Face : then Ann Lee came up to her , and gave her another Knock and tore her Cloak off , and then we ran away after Waters and his Wife , who were gone a good Way before . The next Day I went to Water 's House to see how he did , and was taken up for this Fact . Lee . What Gown had I on ? Waters . A red and white Linnen one : Gilbert Ward . I was standing at my Oyster Stall , and the Prosecutrix came up , and said she had been robb 'd . She went into the Six Canns , and in the mean Time I saw Moll Waters , Susannah Hawkins , and Lee run by . The Woman seem 'd to be very much surprized , and I promis 'd to tell her who they were . Bess Waters . On the Tuesday Morning after this Affair happen 'd , I and my Headborough had a Warrant , and went to Waters 's House We found the two Women Prisoners , the Evidence , and Waters 's Wife drinking Tea together . Lee was not in the Warrant , and so we only took Waters , his Wife and the Evidence before the Justice , but it appearing upon the Examination that Lee was concern 'd , I went to the House for her . There was a Fellow in an Apron with her , and I was pleased to swear a little , and so got her away . She seemed to make Words that she should be taken before the Justice , and Hunt left behind , so we took her too . When they came before the Justice , Hunt said , that Thomas Savage had the Cloak , and had pawned it at the Corner of the Coal-yard , and she owned , that she was with her . The Justice then gave me a search Warrant to fetch the Cloak , and I found it according to their Directions . Nan Lee . I took up Waters and his Wife , and carried them before Mr. De Veil , who committed them to New Prison for further Examination . The Evidence happened to go by my Door in the Afternoon , and I took her to the Round-house , 'till next Morning . We afterwards went to Waters 's , and took the two Women Prisoners . Hunt desired to be made an Evidence , and it was agreed , that she should be one ; so she told where the Cloak was pawn 'd for 3 s. and it was found ; but it afterwards appearing that she was deeply concerned in this Affair , the other Wom an was admitted an Evidence . William Standwell . The two Women Prisoners pawn 'd this Cloak with me for three Shillings . I asked them who owned it , and Lee said it was hers . The next Day the Headborough came with Hunt to my Shop to take out the Cloak ; I knew the Woman again , and delivered it to them directly . Hunt . You ca n't say I brought the Cloak ! Hamlin . Lee owned the Cloak , and the other was with her . Prisoner Lee . I went with them to see for the Gown , and at Turnstile I parted with them and went Home to my Mothers . The next Morning I went to Breakfast at this Gentleman Mr . Waters 's House , and while I was there , the Constable came and took the Gentleman and his Wife away . As to this Cloak , the Evidence over-persuaded me to pawn it , and Hunt went with me .

Thomas Harwood , and Samuel Shuffle , of Stepney , were indicted for assaulting Joseph Lacock , in a certain Field , and open Place near the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Pair of Leather Shoes , a Pair of Silver Buckles , and a Pocket-Book . November , 15th . James Gray . On the 15th of last Month , between 7 and 8 at Night , I was knocked down in a Field behind the Two Loggerheads , going to Shoreditch , by three Persons . I received a Cut upon the Left-side of my Head , so that you might see my Skull very plain , and they took from me my Shoes , a Pair of Silver Buckles , and this Pocket Book , which my Master gave me that Morning for Memorandums for planting Flowers . Q . What did they say to you when they first attack 'd you ? Gray . They knock 'd me down before they spoke , and then I believe they said , D - him , keep him down . Lacock . Ask him how he came by his Pocket-Book again ? Gray . It was produc 'd before the Justice . Lacock . It is very hard to swear to such a Book with no Writing in it . James Gray . On the 15th of Nov. the two Prisoners and I were at Mr. Freeman 's , a Publick House in Bishopsgate street , and saw Mr. Gray come in , and he being pretty much in Liquor , we pretended to see him Home . We went as far as the upper End of Brick Lane into Swan-Fields , and I had hold of his Arm when Lacock knock 'd him down with a Mopstick , and we both tumbled into the Ditch together . Then they took his Shoes and Buckles , and this Pocket-Book . I have known Shuffle about 12 Months ; he is a Velvet-weaver by Trade . Lacock I have known ever since Mackarel Season ; he used to sell Things about the Streets , and we had been drinking together , and had no Design to do any Thing before Gray came into the House , and then we took Notice of his Silver Buckles , and agreed to take them . Joseph Standley . On Wednesday Night last , I was in Company with a Man , and the Prisoner Lacock came and said he had committed some Robberies , and was desirons to leave off this Course of Life , and he made an Evidence , and if we would come next Morning to his Lodging , we should find the other Prisoner and Standley . Accordingly we went and broke the Door open , and found Lacock in one Room , and Standley and Shuffle in the other . He ( Lacock ) own 'd to me , that he himself knock 'd the Man down with a Mopstick , and that the Buckles were sold for 4 s. 6 d and the Shoes for 1 s. We carried them before Mr. Deveil , who perceiving that Lacock was the very Person that knock 'd Gray down , he refused his Information , and admitted Standley an Evidence . This Pocket-Book I fetch 'd from Standley 's Wife , according to his Direction ; she was very scrupulous to let me have it , but I brought it away with me . Here is a Memorandum in it , knock 'd down Sunday Night , and I suppose that relates to this Robbery . Standley . I wrote these Words in it myself Q. to Wornel . Did Shuffle say any Thing before the Justice ? Wornel . He desired to be made an Evidence , and said he could make the greatest Discovery . All of them owned it before Mr. Deveil . Mr. De Veil . These three Men were brought before me before we knew the Person that was attack 'd . They all own 'd the Fact , and called him by the Name of Blake , a Gardiner at Walthamstow . I put them into the News , and the next Day the Prosecutor appear 'd against them . The Prisoners having nothing material to offer in their Defence , the Jury found them both Guilty . Death . 25. Richard Wornell , and Mary Dutton , alias Huntley , were indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 30 s. a Steel Chain , value 6 d. 2 Seals , value 2 d. the Movement of a Watch , value 6 d. and a Cotton Handkerchief , value 3 d. from the Person of Mary Bessier , Nov. 25 . Daniel Rose . Last Tuesday was Sevennight I had been to the Black-Bear in Piccadilly ; and came from thence pretty late , and in Liquor , and before I got Home , I had my Pocket picked of my Watch . I am certain I had it when I left the Black-Bear , for I took it out of my Pocket to see what o'Clock it was , and as to my losing it , the next Witness Mr . Fish can give a better Account than myself , for I was very much in Liquor . Daniel Rose . On the 24th of Nov. about 12 o'Clock , I was going Home , and saw the two Prisoners and William Fish . They had got him in a Door-way near Brownlow street in Holbourn . I saw Dutton with the Watch in her Hand Mr. Rose was very much in Liquor , and she bid him good Night , and ran 'cross the Way directly , and bid the other Woman run too . I perceiv 'd by that that they had robb 'd him of his Watch , so I went up to him , and asked him if he had lost any Thing ? He said he had not , but as soon as he had felt in his Pocket , he attempted to pursue the Prisoners , but being very much in Liquor he fell down . Dutton ran up Warwick Court by the White Hart Tavern , and as soon as I had seized her , I asked her for the Watch , and she pulled it out of her Bosom and thrust it to me . Q . What became of the other Prisoner ? Fish . She did not go away , but staid in the Court . This is the Watch I had of the Prisoner , and before Rose felt for it , he told me the Name on the Dial-Plate . The next Day the Prisoners were carried before Justice Poulson , where Bessier charg 'd Dutton with taking the Guts of a Watch , and a Handkerchief from the Prosecutor in Lincoln 's Inn-Fields . Dutton could not deny it , and they were fetch 'd from her Sister in New Prison , by the Justice 's Order . Daniel Rose . I was Constable of the Night . The Prisoners were brought to me by Mr. Rose and Mr . Fish , and charg 'd with robbing him of a Watch , and the Guts of a Watch besides . Rose was very much fuddled : He had fell in the Kennel , and was so muddy , that he could not see out of his Eyes . When he came to himself , he describ 'd the Watch , and I took the Prisoners to New-Prison that Night . The next Morning they were carried before Justice Paulson , where the tall one Dutton desired to be admitted an Evidence ; but Bessier charg 'd her with taking other Things from the Prosecutor , and she appearing to be the principal Person , the Justice refused to admit her Information . Dutton . I had been with this young Woman to see her Mother , and coming through Lincoln 's Inn-Fields , this Gentleman called after us . His Hat fell off , and I put it on again several Times , and left him . A Man that knew me happen 'd to stop me in Holbourn , and the Prosecutor over took me . He put the Watch into my Hand , and in the mean Time Mr . Fish came up , and asked him if he had not lost his Watch ? The Prosecutor said , he knew who he had given it to , and it was safe . He pulled his Handkerchief out of his Pocket , and the Guts of a Watch left out with it . I would have given them to him again , but he said they were of no Consequence , and I might keep them . Bessier . I was coming along with this Woman , and in Lincoln 's Inn-Fields we met this Man , and the first Thing she took from him was the Guts of the Watch , and afterwards in Brownlow-street she took the Watch out of his Pocket . William Grasing . I can say no farther than that my Daughter ( Bessier ) never behav 'd unhandsome . Eliz . Horn . I keep a House , and have a great many good Things in it , and I never knew that she wrong 'd me of any Thing . Dutton Guilty Death . Bessier acquitted . 27.

Elizabeth Jennings , was indicted for stealing 15 Yards of printed Linnen , the Goods of Elizabeth Breach and Thomas Sweet , Nov 3 . Acquitted . 30 , 31. John Symonds , and Dominick Fitzgerald , were indicted ( with James Lee , alias Welch , and Elizabeth Fitzgerald , not taken ) for that they , after the 24th of June , 1736 , viz . September 16th , at St. Bennet Paul 's Wharf , feloniously forged , and caused to be made and forged , a certain Paper Instrument , partly printed , and partly written , seal 'd , purporting to be the last Will of James Derneane , with a counterfeit Mark thereto subscrib 'd , pretended by them to be the proper Hand-writing of the said Perry , and declared by him in the Name of Peter Perry , by Mistake , which said Paper Instrument is in the Words following , viz . In the Name of God , Amen , I John Perry , Mariner , being of a disposing Mind and Memory , do hereby make my last Will and Testament , & c. First , and principally , I commend my Soul into the Hands of Almighty God , hoping for Remission of my Sins through the Merits of Jesus Christ , my blessed Saviour and Redeemer , and my Body to the Earth or Sea , as it shall please God , and as to such worldly Estate and Effects as I shall at the Time of my Decease be possess 'd of , or entitled to , I give and devise the same as followeth . I give to my dearly beloved Sister Peter Perry , all such Sum or Sums of Money , as now is , or hereafter shall grow , and become due to me for my Service on board the Lancaster Man of War , or any other Ship or Ships whatsoever ; And I hereby nominate , constitute and appoint the said Ann Perry , her Heirs and Assigns , sole Executrix of this my last Will and Testament , and all the rest and residue of my Estate whatsoever , both real and personal ; and I do declare , this to be my last Will and Testament , hereby revoking all former Will or Wills by me made . In witness whereof I have hereunto set my Hand and Seal , this 28th , Day of March , 1737 , in the Tenth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord by the Grace of God , & c. Ann Perry : + His Mark . Sign 'd , Seal 'd and Declar 'd in the Presence of Us , by the said John Perry , as , and for his last Will and Testament . John Perry . John Rogers . With Intent to defraud our said Lord the King , & c. The Indictment farther charged the Prisoners with publishing the said Will , knowing it to be forg 'd and counterfeit . The Council for the Prosecution set forth , that the Crimes of which the Prisoners stood indicted , were in their own Nature , as destructive of Society , and as Heinons as any Crimes could possibly be . That it was for this Reason , ( the Crimes of Forgery and Perjury being so frequent , the Error that flieth by Night , and the secret Transactions by which the Lives and Properties of every Man were in Danger ) the Punishment which was extremely mild , was not thought adequate to the Crime , and therefore the Wisdom of the Legislature , thought fit by an Act of this present Majesty , to make this Offence Felony , without Benefit of Clergy . That this Law was to be in Force for five Years only , but before its Expiration , the good Effects of it were perceived , and it was therefore revived , and made perpetual , by another Act of the 9th of his present Majesty , & c. & c. The Act of the 2d of the King which made this Offence Felony , and the Act for the reviving and making the same perpetual , were read . James Welch . I am Clerk to the Deputy-Register of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury . Mr. Taverner the Proctor , brought this to me , as the original Will of John Goodwin . Peter Perry This Paper was brought to me as Perry 's Will . I ca n't tell whether it was William Taverner , or Dominick Fitzgerald , produced it . Council . Who brought it ? Mr. Taverner . I ca n't tell who produced it , but Fitzgerald was present , and the Executrix too . Lee was not there when the Will was first brought ; he came to account for the Error in it . I got the Executrix sworn before Doctor Chapman , and then I observed a Mistake of John at the Bottom , instead of Peter , upon which I applied to the Register 's Clerk who told me that Error must be accounted for . I then told the Executrix , Ann Kelly , in the Prisoner Dominick 's hearing , that she must either produce the Person that wrote the Will , or one that was present at the Execution of it to account for the Mistake . They went away that Time , and the next Day Dominick brought the other Prisoner Lee to me , - I ca n't tell whether Kelly was present then . I am certain Lee was , for I took particular Notice of him as he came into the Court . He pretended that his Name was Welch , and that he was one of the subscribing Witnesses . Council . Did he make any Affidavit that Night ? Mr. Taverner . No ; he seemed to be in Liquor , and I told him the Thing he came about was of a very serious Nature , therefore I would not draw an Affidavit for a Person in such a Condition . I appointed him to come some other Time , when he was perfectly sober , and I think the next Morning he came , and I took Instructions from him , and had him sworn to it . This is the Affidavit , he swore to it by the Name of Welch , and I have attested it . Council . Was any Body with him when he came to swear . Mr. Taverner . The other Prisoner was with him ; I took particular Notice of him ( Fitzgerald ) his Person is so particular , that I ca n't easily forget him , and he asserted , that it was the Will of Ann Kelly . Council . When they left you , where did you carry the Will and Affidavit ? Mr. Taverner . I delivered them to Mr. Goodwin , in Order to have the Probate filled up . Goodwin . These are the same that I had from Mr. Taverner , and they are in the same Condition now , except this Tear on the Back . The Will was read . Council . Read the Affidavit , It was read. `` This Day appeared personally , James `` Welch , of St. George , Bloomsbury , Linnen draper , `` aged about 50 Years , and alledges , that `` he has been well acquainted with Peter Perry , `` late of his Majesty 's Ship the Lancaster , `` Widower , for about 25 Years , to the Time `` he enter 'd on board the said Ship , & c. and `` farther deposes , that he , ( this Deponent ) did `` write and fill up all the Blanks , and is one `` of the subscribing Witnesses to the said Will `` of Peter Perry , beginning thus , In the Name `` of God Amen , and ending thus , Peter Perry , his `` Mark ; and that the said Perry did make his `` Mark , and deliver the same , and that he the `` said Deponent , did by Mistake write the Name `` of John Perry , but that the said Deceased 's `` is John Perry . Council . Are you sure that the Prisoner Lee is the Person who swore this by the Name of Welch ? Mr. Taverner . Yes , the fat Person ( Lee ) is the Man . Doctor Chapman . I am the proper Person to grant Probates , and I remember granting one to this Will ; - here is my Hand to it . Council . Do you remember the Person that swore that Affidavit ? Dr. Chapman . No , I ca n't say that I do . Council . Where was this transacted ? Dr. Chapman . In my Chambers at Doctors-Commons , in the Parish of St. Benedict . The Probate was read . Prisoner Lee . Ask Mr. Taverner what Condition I was in when this was made ? Mr. Taverner When he came first , he behaved as if he had been drinking ; his Eyes looked heavy , and he talk 'd as People usually do under such Circumstances , but when he came the next Day to be sworn , he was perfectly Sober . Lee . I was as crazy and as lunatic as any Thing could be , and I knew no more what I was doing , thin the Child that is unborn . Peter Perry . The thin Man in the Bar is Fitzgerald , the fat one is Lee . About the Middle of September last , the two Prisoners , Fitzgerald 's reputed Wife , Christopher Ecklin , James Dernean , and James Broughton , came to my House . We had a good deal of Discourse about going to the Navy-Office , and they asked me to go with them . I told them , I had some Business with my Coal-Man at Billingsgate , and would walk so far with them . At their Desire I went with them as far as Tower Hill , and they attempted to go into the Ship , but there being some Company there , we came out again . We then went to the Tyger : that House was full of Soldiers , and therefore we adjourned from thence to the Three Crowns in Thames-street . We call 'd for a Pot of Beer , and then Lee said to Fitzgerald , Dominick ! you know what we come about ! why do n't you do that Thing ? So I will , said Fitzgerald ; upon which he took a Paper out of his Pocket , which I found to be a blank Sailor 's Will . He filled up the Spaces , and made the Mark , and then James Lee signed it in the Name of Welch , and John Parrel did the like in the Name of James Dernean . Counc Is that the same Will as you saw Fitzgerald fill up ? Ecklin . I am in a manner very sure of it , for in rubbing it to make it look old and dirty , they tore it here before they carried it to Mr. Taverner 's ; besides Fitzgerald said to me , Come Mr. Ecklin , wo n't you be a Witness to this Will ? Why , ( said Lee ) you may as well , for we received Money but last Week on such an Account as this ; no Body can be a Sufferer , for this Money goes to the Chatham Chest , and the King never pays twice . I desired to be excused , and then Fitzgerald said , I am but a poor Man , and there is a good deal of Wages due to this Man , and if I knew that any Body would discover , I 'd run a Knife into him . Counc . Was Fitzgerald 's Wife there ? Ecklin . Yes , she personated John Rogers . Fitzgerald . How long has he known me ? Ecklin . I had not been intimate with him till a Fortnight before this . Lee . How long has he known me ? Ecklin . About 6 or 8 Months . Lee . Ask him if I signed the Will ? Ecklin . Yes , he signed by the Name of Ann Perry . Fitzgerald . I should be glad to know what Manner of a House he keeps . James Welch . I am a Clerk i n the Ticket-Office , under the Commissioners of the Navy : Counc . Was there any Money due to Edward Bentham ? Bentham . He belonged to the Ship Lancaster , and at the Time of his Decease there were 42 l. 16 s. due to him . There was a Ticket made out for the Payment of it , and it was transmitted by the Officers of the Ship to the Navy-Office . Counc . After this Ticket was made out , was it delivered to any Person ? Bentham . Yes , I deliver 'd it myself to Peter Perry . She brought the Probate of a Will , and I believe this to be the same . Fitzgerald . He owns his Acquaintance with me is but short , and I hope you will consider that it ca n't be forging the Will of Ann Kelly , to write Peter Perry . Lee . This John Perry knew very well , and I had formerly made a Will for him , and sign 'd it John Perry by Mistake . That Will was lost , and they have trump 'd up this Will , and brought me to make an Affidavit , thinking it was the real one . I knew I had made such a Will , and I thought this had been the same , and they threaten 'd to have my Life , and tear me to Pieces if I would not make an Affidavit of it . As for the Name of Welch , I was in Debt , and therefore was sometimes obliged to conceal my true Name . Both Guilty , Death . 32 , 33. Peter Perry I and Margaret Watson , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , were indicted , Watson for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 3 l. from the Person of Elizabeth Dogget , alias Lyons , and Dogget for receiving it , knowing it to be stolen , Oct. 33. William Head . On Friday the 30th of October , I had been to several Places , and returning Home , I saw the Prisoner Mrs. Watson near Drury Lane , crying , and leaning her Head against a Post . She telling me that her Child had net eat a Bit of Bread that Day , I put my Hand in my Pocket , and offered her a Penny . She refused it , and said , that would hardly make her drink , but she had an Apartment hard by , and desired me to go with her . At her Request I went with her into a House in Holford 's Alley , Dogget 's , I think they call it . She took me into a little Room and called for a Dram , and then she wanted me to give her a Present . I refused , upon which she knocked with her Heel , and somebody below cry 'd , Above ! D - n you , above . Immediately I missed my Watch , and the Prisoner left me , and I being afraid of my Life , stole down Stairs as if I had been a Thief myself . The Prisoners were taken afterwards , and Watson confessed to me at Mr. Rice 's in Vinegar-Yard , that she took the Watch from me , and gave it to the other Prisoner before she got off the Stairs , and that she was to have 5 s. Poundage for pawning it . Pris . Watson . Ask him whether an old Woman did not go into the Room to take the Candle away ? Head . No . Watson . He pulled off his Hat when he went away , and I never saw him till the Wednesday following . Court . Was you sober ? Head . No , I was not . Wm Head . I keep the Cheshire Cheese in Vinegar-Yard . One Friday Night after 10 o ' Clock , - I ca n't tell the Day of the Month , Mr. Head came to my House very melancholy , and complained that he had lost his Watch . He said at our House all Night , and the next Day he went to find out the House . They say one Lyons keep it , and one Prudence Rice , who uses the House , brought the Prisoner Watson to us . Mr. Head immediately took hold of her , and charg 'd her with robbing him . She denied it a little at first , but afterwards she own 'd she took the Watch , and that she gave it to Cordelia Taylor upon the Stairs . Accordingly she sent for Dogget , and she denied she had it ; but Watson wrung her Hands and cried and begg 'd of her to let Mr. Head have it again , and notwithstanding all that she refused . Then they were carried before the Justice , and just as they were going to be committed , Dogget said , we might send to the Parliament House in the Strand for it ; but no Body would go for it , and so they were sent to Prison . They were afterwards brought up for further Examination , and then Dogget own 'd that she had the Watch , and that she was to have a Crown Poundage out of it . Q to Head . When did you first miss your Watch ? Head . While I was in the Room with her , I look 'd at my Watch to see what it was o'Clock , and I told her I must be at the Fountain in Cheapside before 10 . She said I might do any Thing with her , but I refused to have any Thing to say to her . Dogget . Did he see her give me the Watch , or did I bring in any Liquor ? Head . No . Dogget . I have nothing to say , for I , never saw the Watch , nor ever serv 'd them a Drop of Liquor . Jury to Head . Was any Body else in the Room with you but Watson ? Head . One Bess Dogget brought up a Quartern of Gin , and just put it on the Chest of Drawers , but went away immediately , and was not near me at all . Watson Guilty , Death , Dogget Guilty .

He was a second Time charg 'd by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for Manslaughter . Christopher Shotton . On the 23d of Sept. last , there was a Cricket-Match at Staines Moor , between the Men of Staines and Brentford . I saw the Prisoner pulling Herne among the Croud , and I saw Shotton strike him twice , while he had hold of him . The Deceased was presently taken ill , and after that , I saw him no more . Q . Did the Deceased engage in the Play after this ? Pelton . Yes , he play 'd till he was bowl 'd out , and whether he ran once or twice I ca n't tell . Q . For what Reason do you think the Prisoner took hold of the Deceased ? Pelton . I took it to be to get him in to play . - I saw nothing more done by the Prisoner . Charles Pelton . I saw the Prisoner take hold of my Brother 's Collar , and pull him to force him to o la . In the forcing he chuck 'd him on the Throat , and I saw Shotton strike him two or three Blows on the Breast , and it is my Opinion they were the Death of him . He lived but Weeks afterwards , and always complain 'd of his Stomach and Throat . Q . Was any Thing said to your Brother before the Prisoner laid hold of him ? Herne . I did not hear him asked to play before by any Body : the laying hold was the first that I saw . Q . Did he complain while he was playing , that he was any way affected by those Blows ? Herne . No . Q . When the Prisoner laid hold of him , did he do it to help off his Coat ? Herne . No , to pull him in to play . A Witness . I saw the Prisoner take hold of this Man by the Coat , in order to carry him up to the Wicket to play . Shotton hit him 2 Blows , one over the Prisoner 's Arm , and one under it . Q . Did he complain of any Injury afterwards ? Witness . He said , he believ 'd those Rogues had given him his Death . I saw nothing done by the Prisoner but the laying hold of his Collar to make him play . Q . Did he play long after this ? Witness . He got one Notch according to the Rule of the Play . Thomas Herne . I saw John Allen the next Day : he told me that the Prisoner took him by the Collar to lead him to the Wicket , and that Shotton gave him some Blows on the Breast . He complained that his Breast and his Throat were very sore , and said , that the Prisoner in pulling him along chuck 'd his Throat so that he could not tell how to swallow any Thing . He lived about 3 Weeks afterwards , and always complained of the Blow . John Herne . The Morning after the Cricket-Match I went down to William Banks 's Boat and called him . He answer 'd me in a very low Voice , and said he had been used so barbarously at the Cricket-Match , that he was murder 'd . He went with me to my House , and my Servant drew him some Beer , but he could not drink it . He said he knew one of the Persons that had used him ill , and mention 'd the Prisoner 's Name . Prisoner . Did not the Deceased lie in his Boat all Night ? Banks . Yes , I believe he did , and it is as common for them to lie in their Boats , as for us to lie in our Beds . Pris . Q . Can you tell where he had been before he went to his Boat ? Banks . At the Three Pidgeons . John Herne . I was Nurse to him in his Illness . He had a violent Fever and Convulsions , and all his Complaint was of his left Side , so that he could not lie upon it . I used to ask him his Complaint , and he said , those Rognes that beat one have killed me , and hang them , hang them : These were his Words . I saw him open 'd , and he was all black on the Heart , and one of his Ribs was broke , but the Surgeon can give a better Account of that than I can . Ann Foster . I stood Umpter ( Umpire ) at the Wicket , and there was a Sort of a Demur about a Man 's coming in . I saw the Prisoner bring him along by the Collar , and I saw Shotton strike him a Blow . He seem 'd to be unwilling to go in to play , and said he would go in next . C. What had the Prisoner and Shotton to do in this ? Smith . Nothing at all except they laid any Betts . The Deceased did go in and ran one Notch , and was out at the same End as I stood at . He said he was very ill , and wish 'd he was at Home , but I did not hear him make any particular Complaint . Pris . Q . Did you hear any Thing but what was civil done or said by me ? Smith . No , if there had I must have seen it , and I ca n't say that he used him ill any otherwise than bringing him along to play . Mr. Dudhill , Surgeon . On the 18th of Nov. last I was sent for to view the Body of the Deceased on the Coroner 's Inquest . I found an external Contusion on the Skin , about 8 Inches Diameter , which extended to the left Hypocondriack . Upon opening the Body I found the Cartilage of the eighth Rib on the left Side broken : in the left Cavity of the Thorax , I found between 15 or 20 Ounces of extravasated Blood , and the back part of the Lungs on that same Side were vastly inflam 'd . Then I examin 'd the right Cavity of the Thorax , and found 4 or 5 Ounces of Blood , and the Colon and the interior Parts of the Stomach were gangreen 'd . Council . How do you apprehend that to be done ? Mr. Dudhill . By the Blows I should imagine , and certainly they were the Cause of his Death , for otherwise he was found . C. How long did you see him after he was dead ? Mr. Dudhill . He died on the Wednesday , and I opened him on the Monday . C. Do you think that any Fever was the Occasion of this Disorder ? Mr. Dudhill . That has not yet come to my Knowledge : my Opinion is , that it proceeded from these Bruises and Blows . Pris . Q . Is it not common in a malignant Fever to have Part of the Stomach inflamed ? Mr. Dudhill . I have never seen it . Pris . Q . Might not that Rib be broke by a Fall ? Mr. Dudhill . Yes , to be sure it might . C. Was there any Appearance of Blackness upon the Place where the Rib was broke ? Mr. Dudhill . Yes , about eight Inches Diameter . Q . If any Person receives a Blow , will the Cartilage , or the Rib break first ? Mr. Dudhill . The Cartilage would break sooner than the Rib . DEFENCE . I think it was on the 23d of September , I heard there was to be a Cricket-Match between the Towns of Brentford , and Staines . I happened to have a Friend come in to dine with me , and therefore I thought we might after Dinner divert ourselves in seeing this Cricket-Match . They played very easy and quiet till the latter Part of the Game , when there were two Men to go in on the Brentford Side , and neither of those Men would go in ; so a great Uproar began . The Deceased 's Coat was unbutton 'd , and I took hold of his Coat very inoffensively , as I thought , and desired him to go in . He d - 'd me , and asked me , what it was to me ; upon which , I told him , if he did not play , it should be worse for him , for I would stand by the other Men , and see them righted , if it cost me 20 l. He lifted up his Hand , and I thought he had been going to strike me , and so I left him , and saw him no more . Joseph Smith . I was sitting on a Bench smoaking a Pipe just by the Prisoner , and saw him take hold of the Deceased . He told him , if he would not go in , he would Sue him if it cost him 20 l. I never saw the Prisoner attempt to strike him , neither did Shotton meddle with him while the Prisoner had hold of him . Q Did the Man play afterwards ? Johnson . Yes , very well . The Prisoner was in as good a Humour as could be , and talked to him as one Neighbour does to another . Richard Johnson . I was on Horseback on a pretty bighish Horse , and the Deceased was talk 'd off to go in , but seemed unwilling . The Prisoner took hold of his Cloaths , and bid him go in and play a fair Game , or else he would assist the Staines Men in getting the Money . At last he did go in , and play 'd very well 'till he was bowl 'd out . There was nothing done to hurt him that I saw , and the Prisoner 's Hand was never higher than his Breast . He afterwards leap 'd and skip 'd about , and I do n't know whether he was not the most active Man of the two and twenty . I have been acquainted with the Prisoner above 20 Years , and have played many a Game at Cricket with him , but I have done with it now . William Slaughter . I was one of the Gamesters , and stood just by . The Deceased was to have gone in the Time before he did , but another would go in before him , and when his Turn came , he refused , so the Prisoner took hold of him , and after he had loosed him , Shotton struck him and went out of the Ring . William Saunders , junior . I was one of the Gamesters , and was there all the Time . I saw the Prisoner take hold of the Deceased , and heard him say , if he did not go in , he should lose the Money if it cost him 20 l. The Deceased seemed to be uneasy , and shuffled from the Prisoner , and was going away ; and then Kitt Shotton gave him a push and desired him to go in . Council . You call it a push , did not you see Shotton give him three or four Blows with his Fist ? Haysler . No , I did not . Counc . Do you think that Push could break his Ribs ? Haysler No , nor hurt him neither . Edward Haysler , senior . I was in a one horse Chaise , and saw the Prisoner pull the Man along to make him go in . The Deceased got loose from him , and the Prisoner went back to his Seat , and Blows I saw none . Q . How was the Game plaid out ? Haysler . There were about thirteen Minutes for them to play , and this Man went in and looked as sprightly as could be , and if there had been any Blows or Fighting , I must have seen it . Dr. Merrick . I attended the Deceased , and found him in very strong Symptoms of a malignant Fever , which is sufficient to kill any Man without Bruises . I viewed his Body in his Life-time , and saw no Blackness upon it . Mr. Dudhill apprehended there was some Mischief about his Ribs , upon which I looked at them , and observed one Cartilage to stand hither than the rest , but I did not venture to press hard enough upon it , to see whether it was broken or not . Q . Did he make any Complaints to you ? Dr. Merrick . He was rather too low to make any ; what Questions I asked about his Disorder , were rather answered by the People about him . Edward Haysler , Esq ; James Brooks , and three other Persons , had known the Prisoner different Numbers of Years , and always thought him an honest , inoffensive Man . Acquitted . 41 , 42 , 43.

That soon afterwards , the Child complained of being ill , and upon being examin 'd , said , that the Prisoner had done her this Injury , and would have given her a Half-penny to conceal it from her Aunt . Elizabeth Coy deposed , That she finding the Girl 's Linnen out of Order , examin 'd her about it : That at first she denied that any Person had meddled with her ; but on this Witness 's threatning to beat her , she owned that the Prisoner had taken her into the Room , and laid her on the Board on which he stood to work , and there abused her . Mr. Welch , Surgeon , who was sent for to view the Girl , gave a particular Account of the Condition he found her in , & c. and farther said , that she gave the same account of the Fact when before the Justice as she had done to the other Witnesses . This Witness being asked on Behalf of the Prisoner , whether it was possible for an Offence of this Kind to be committed on a Board , supported only by a Pail and a Ladder , or Trussel , as this was supposed to be , answered , that unless such Board were firmly supported , it was scarcely possible . Mary Coy , nine Years old last April , deposed , that being sent up into Mrs. Morin 's Room , the Prisoner called her to him , and laid her on the Board , on which he was at work , & c. afterwards offered her a Half-penny , which she refusing , he said , Take it Hussey , and tell your Ann if you dare ! This Witness , in Answer to a Question ask 'd on Behalf of the Prisoner , said , that Elizabeth Coy , a Person who attended the Prisoner in his Business , was at the Time of the Commission of this Fact , heating Size at the Fire below Stairs , and was not within hearing .

That he had known him 5 Years , and never heard but that he was a downright honest Man . Mr . Jewel , Surgeon , deposed , That he was sent by the Prisoner to inspect the Child , but was denied seeing her . That it was his Opinion , it was impossible a Child of such tender Year , could be thus abused without hurting her extremely , in Consequence of which she could not help crying out . Thomas Cleaver said he had known the Prisoner 6 Years , that he was a married Man , and believ 'd him to be as sober and honest a Man as any in England . Acquitted . 55.

On the 29th of October , about three in the Afternoon , coming down Ludgate-Hill , between Mr. Ashley 's Door and the Rainbow Coffee-house , I was attacked by the Prisoner and 3 or 4 more . They jostled and pushed me backwards and forwards , and at last pushed my Servant from me . Then they held up my Arms , and that very Man at the Bar ran at me , in Order to take my Watch from me . He got hold of the Chain , and with the first pull he broke one of the Links of it , upon which I spoke to him , but notwithstanding that , he pull 'd a second Time , and then got it , and I saw it in his Hand . He was taken presently and carried to the Watch house , and from thence to Bridewell , and before I could see him , he had chang 'd his Dress . John Hall . On Lord-Mayor 's Day , I was walking in Procession with the Haberdasher 's Company , and just as we came to Mr. Ashley 's Punch-House , I heard an Out-cry of a Pick-pocket . I saw the Prisoner stooping under the Pole of a Coach , and this Watch thrown under the Horses Legs . I took up the Watch and carried it into Mr. Ashley 's , where Mr. Cooper describing it , I gave it him , and I believe it has been in his Possession ever since . Thomas Cooper . I was standing over-against Mr. Ashley 's to see the Armourer 's Company go by , and heard some People cry , Stop Thief ! Immediately the Prisoner try 'd to push under the Pole of a Hackney Coach ; I took hold of his Collar , and he made great Resistance , but a Soldier coming to my Assistance we secured him , and carried him to the Watch house . Mr. Ashley confirm 'd Part of Mr. Hall 's Evidence . Pris . Last Lord-Mayor 's Day I happened to be upon Ludgate-Hill , and about 5 Minutes after the Man on Horseback was gone by , there was a Cry of Stop Thief ! Presently a Man rushed by me , and that Man ( Blay ) said he would lay hold of me . John Blay . I have known him two Years and upwards , and never knew no Harm by him . His Business is a Poulterer , and he always bore an honest Character . Jury . Does he keep a Shop ? Prisoner . No , I am a running Poulterer .

Samuel West , was indicted for stealing a Silk Handkerchief , and 3 s. the Goods and Money of Hannah Rossiter , Oct. 15 . Thomas Bigee . I am a Waterman by my Business . On the 16th of October , I had been out all Day with a Fare , and made it very late at Night before I landed them at Westminster , and being late I got a Coach for them , and they left me . After this , as I was walking along to Hungerford , this Woman met me , and said , How do you do Brother Waterman ? I told her I did not know her : why says she , I have seen you often enough at Westminster . She asked me to make her drink ; I told her I did not care if I did ; and she told me there was an Acquaintance of her 's just by , where we could have a Glass of good Wine . I said Wine was too dear for Watermen ; but however she carried me as far as the Hay-market , and we went into a Room , and called for a Pint of Wine . She sat down on one Chair and I on another , and when we had drank out that Pint , I was for going , but by her Persuasions I called for another . I being tir 'd with sitting up so long , sat down on the Bed , and I suppose she thought I was asleep , for I had not been there 5 Minutes before she made bold to take the Handkerchief off my Neck . I had a Mind to see what she would do with me , and therefore I lay still ; but presently she put her Hand in my Pocket to feel for my Money . Then I thought it Time to get up , and said I , you fancy impudent W - e , ca n't you be content to take my Handkerchief , and not my Money ? D - your Eyes , said she , did I take your Handkerchief ? that was the next Word : why I saw you , said I ; D - you , said she , I took none ; that was the next Word . I took 3 s. out of my Pocket , ( for I had Money in both ) and laid it on the Table , but her Hands were quicker than mine , and she took that too . I took hold of her , and tore her Apron out of the Gathers , and then she said she would swear her Life against me . I would not make any Disturbance in the Room , so I deliver 'd her to a Watchman , and he said he knew her to be a Whore and a Thief from her Cradle , that was the next Word . They put her down the dark Hold , and took my Word till next Morning , and then we went to the Justice 's , where she pull 'd out 3 s one of them was Queen Ann 's Shilling , and she d - d me and said , she would be merry with that . As soon as she came out of the Justice 's , she shew 'd her white Stockings , and said , do you think these white Stockings can walk to the Gatehouse ? No , D - you , I will have a Coach ; and so because she should not plague us , I gave them a Shilling to get Madam a Coach . Pris . If he found me taking his Handkerchief , why did he not take bold of me ? Bigee . Because I had a Mind to lie a little longer , to see what she would do with me , for I did not know whether she would not take all my Cloaths off . Thomas Bigee . I was before the Justice with her , and she denied taking the Handkerchief , but when she came out of the House she put her Hands under her Coats in this Manner , and said , Here you Blackguard , here is your Handkerchief , and I 'll carry it to Goal with me to keep my Head warm .

On the 5th of Sept. about 7 or 8 o'Clock at Night , I was coming along by the Fleet Market , and the Prisoner came up to me , and asked me to give her Part of a Pint of Beer . I asked her what I should get by that ? but however she led me into some back Streets , and took me into a House in a narrow Passage , where I had not been 3 Minutes before I missed my Watch . Immediately the Prisoner ran down Stairs : I caught hold of her , but missed my hold , and then a little Girl came up Stairs , and asked me what was the Matter ? I told her I had lost my Watch , upon which she took me down a different Way to a Public House , pretending to help me to the Prisoner . She went in herself and bid me stay at the Door till she came out again ; and I thinking she staid long , went in to enquire for her , but she was gone . After this I went up and down , and happen 'd to hear a strange Girl say that Thomas Slocomb had stole a Gold Watch , so I desir 'd her to shew me where she lived , and she accordingly carried me to the Prisoner . I was by myself then , and therefore was afraid to apprehend the Prisoner ; but on Admiral Vernon 's Birth Day , I took her , and while I went to get a Constable she made her Escape , and I could hear nothing of her till last Monday . Prisoner . I do live at the House to be sure , but it was short arm 'd Joice that picked him up . Lucretia Devine . About 10 or 12 Weeks ago , I met the Prisoner in Cheapside . She ask 'd me to give her a Pint of Beer , and we had some Discourse about this Watch , and while we were talking , Short arm 'd Joice came in and said , What signifies your talking ? I committed the Robbery ! Thomas Williams deposed to the same Effect . Edward Lloyd . I happen 'd to go into the House where the Prosecutor and the Prisoner were , and I heard him say she was not the Person that pick 'd his Pocket , and that he had no Design to Prosecute her , only to put her in a little Fear and Terror .
