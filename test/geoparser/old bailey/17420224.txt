George Lander , of St. Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , value 7 Pounds , the Goods of Hearsay Broomhead , in his dwelling House , October 7th . This Mark + is prefixed to such Indictments on which the Prisoners would receive Sentence of Death , should the Jury find them guilty , which will in this and many other Cases account for the Jury 's either finding the Value of the Goods to be less than is laid in the Indictment , or abating the Charge . By an Act of the 15th of his present Majesty any Person convicted of stealing any Sheep or other Cattle , or feloniously killing any Sheep , with Intent to steal any Part of the same , must suffer Death , as Persons convicted of Felony , without Benefit of Clergy . The following are likewise capital Offences . Privately stealing above the Value of 1 Shilling from the Person . Stealing the Value of 5 Shillings out of a Shop , Warehouse , Coach-house or Stable . Stealing the Value of 40 Shillings out of a dwelling House . Hearsay Broomhead . On the 7th of last October , the Prisoner and another came to my House , and drank a Tankard of Beer . He ( the Prisoner ) staid about 2 or 3 Hours , and then took an Opportunity to go off with the Tankard . Q : Did you see him take away the Tankard ? Broomhead . No ; but I advertised it ; and about a Week afterwards , a Person came and informed me , that he had pawn 'd it in his own Name for four Guineas ; and we went and found it accordingly at this Woman , Mrs. Snelling 's House . The Tankard had been pawn 'd there , but it was taken from thence to another Place where I found it . Q . When did you first miss your Tankard ? Broomhead . Within half an Hour after the Prisoner was gone . Q . Were there any other People drinking with him ? Broomhead . Yes , but they went away before him . Q . Are you sure the Tankard you missed was the Tankard they were drinking out of ? Broomhead . Yes , this is the Tankard ; it is old sterling , and cost me 8 l. 2 s. 9 d. Prisoner . I have spent a great deal of Money in his House , and have lodged in his House . Ask him if I ever wrong 'd him of any Thing in my Life ? Broomhead . He did lodge in my House now and then a Night , when he has been late about Business . I ca n't charge him with any Thing , 'till this Affair , and I am sorry I can do it now . Elizabeth Snelling . On the 7th of October , the Prisoner came to our House with another Man to recommend him , and desired to have 4 Guineas on a Tankard . I accordingly lent him the Money , and if he had asked for more , I should have lent it him . The next Day , the other Man 's Wife came , and desired to have the Tankard . I scrupled it , and said , it was not usual to deliver Goods , but to the Persons that brought them , upon which she went away . She soon afterwards returned with another Person , who was to lay down the Money for it ; but I still insisted on seeing the Person that brought it ; upon which , she went and fetched me a Note , sign 'd George Lander . I ca n't tell whose Hand it was , because I never saw the Prisoner 's writing , and upon that Account , I would not let her have the Tankard . She then fetched her Husband , and I delivered it to him , upon the other Man , Swanson 's laying down the Money for it . Prisoner . I pawned the Tankard at her House for 4 Guineas . Thomas Snelling . I never saw the Prisoner till the Day he was taken up , which was the 4th of this Month . There came three Watchmen to my Mother 's , to know whether the Prisoner had not pledged a Tankard with us . I told them we had had such a one , but it had been redeemed . I went with them to the Prosecutor 's House , and found the Prisoner there in Custody of an Officer with several other Persons ; and I heard him confess , that he stole the Tankard , and ( he said ) he would tell no Lies . Q . How came he to say so much ? Snelling . I asked him when he came into the Room , and he directly own 'd it , and said , he would tell no lies ; he likewise confess 'd , that he pledg 'd it at our House the same Evening that he stole it . Daniel White I am a Shoemaker , and lodg 'd at Swanson 's House . Mr. Martin came to me , and informed me , he had got a Piece of Plate at 2 Pawnbroker 's , who , he believed was not in good Circumstances , therefore desired me to prevail on my Landlord to lay down the Money for him , that he might redeem it . I think he said , it was in for 4 Pounds or 4 Guineas , I ca n't tell which . My Landlord agreed to take it out , and they went away together , and in a short Time Swanson returned with the Tankard . Lawrence Swanson . Martin and his Wife came to my House , and begg 'd of me to lay down 4 Guineas to fetch a Piece of Plate out of Pawn , being desirous to put it into better Hands . Accordingly I went with Mrs. Martin , and she took out the Tankard , and directly pledged it at another Place , and returned me my Money . George Wood . I live with Mr. Bonner in Aldersgate-Street . About the 23d of last October , my Master called me down from Work , and told me , I must go with one Mrs. Allen , to fetch a Tankard out of Pawn from Mr. Smith 's . It was pawn 'd for 5 Guineas , and we fetched it out , and my Master lent 6 l. 10 s. on it . Woodfield Walker . I have known the Prisoner seven or eight Years . I knew him when he set up for himself , and have bought Shoes of him several Times . I never heard of his wronging Man , Woman or Child . Thomas Cross . I have known the Prisoner fourteen Years , and never heard no ( any ) Crime against him till now , and what it is now , I know not . John Haines . I knew him in his Apprentice-ship . His Master lived in the Neighbourhood , and I never heard any Thing amiss of him till now . Another Thomas Cross . I have known him 6 or 7 Years : He has made Shoes for me , and my Family , and I never heard a Word of Ill of him on no Account . Richard Edwards . I have known him 7 Years , and never heard any Ill of him before : He always bore a very good Character as far as ever I heard . Edward Follit . I have known him seven or eight Years , and never heard any Ill of him , or knew him to be guilty of any Crime : I was a Neighbour to him .

Catherine Stock . On the 15th of Jan. about 8 at Night , I was sitting just by my Parlour-Door with a Child in my Arms , and saw three Persons pass by the Shop and look in very often . I had 3 Shew Glasses standing within the Window , and in a few Minutes I saw Afflack put his Hand on the Window Frame . I did not see it lift up then , but presently I saw him draw the Shew Glass away , in which were all the Goods mentioned in the Indictment , and a great many other Things that I ca n't recollect . It stood within the Window , and the Shop Door was bolted . Pris . Afflack .

Pris . Q . Where was you when the Shew Glass was taken away ? Mrs. Stock . I sat just at the little Door that opens into the Parlour . Pris . Q . You have sworn to Afflack , did you know him before he was taken up ? Mrs. Stock . I never saw him before that Night , but I look 'd so earnestly at his Face , that I knew him when I saw him again . Pris . Q . How came you to discern so particularly as to distinguish Afflack ? Mrs. Stock There was a Lamp at the Door , and a Candle in my Shop , and I sat with my Face towards the Shop . Q . Are you a married Woman ? Mrs. Stock . Yes , - my Husband 's Name is Andrew Stock . Mary Westbury . I was going to Mrs. Stock 's with a Child 's Coat and Skirt , and saw Afflack standing with his Hand upon the Post by the Door , and another Man in a blue Coat with his Back against the Wall . Q . Did you hear Mrs. Stock complain of being robb 'd ? Westbury . I was not in her House then , but my Mistress went to her , and Mrs. Stock told her she had been robb 'd . Pris Q . Did Mrs. Stock enquire of you whether you had seen any Body about her Shop ? Westbury . Yes , and I described Afflack and another to her , but I saw three Men in all . Pris . Q . Has not one Burt had some Talk with you about this Affair ? Westbury . Burt never said any Thing to me about it . Mr. Deveil The Evidence of Mrs. Stock and the young Woman ( Westbury ) is verbatim the same as before me . Mrs. Stock then swore positively to Afflack , but as to the Confession of Lowdon , he said he knew who had taken the Goods , but did not say that he was there . William Stapleton . I was at Mr. Deveil 's when the Prisoners were examined , and heard Lowdon say he was concern 'd in taking the Shew Glass away , and Afflack and another Man were likewise concern 'd in carrying it off ; Lowdon mentioned something of a pair of Silver Buckles which the other Man took away with him . Q. to Mrs. Stock . Do you remember any Thing that was declar 'd by the Prisoners before the Justice ? Mrs. Stock . Yes , they said there was a pair of Silver Buckles with Roses and Diamonds , which one Smith then had in his Shoes . Werwood Barret . I happen 'd to be at Colonel Deveil 's , and to the best of my Knowledge heard Lowdon say , what Afflack was the Man that carried away the Things . Andrew Stock . In Regard to the shutting of the Shop , I shut it myself , and when the Prisoners were before Mr. Deveil , Lowdon was willing to be made an Evidence , with this Proviso , that I should have my Goods again . He accordingly inform 'd me that they were sold to two Jews , Aaron Polock and Moses Brew , who lived in Shoemaker Row , near Aldgate , and that he ( Lowdon ) had 15 Guineas for his Part of the Goods . Upon this I got a Warrant and proper Assistance to search , but did not find any of them again . Q . Did Lowdon confess the selling your Goods to those Jews ? Mr. Stock . Yes ; he said he had 15 Guineas for his Share , but they sunk some of them , and the Jews had got every Skin of them , ( that was his Expression ) and the other Man ( Smith ) had got a pair of my Buckles with Roses and Diamonds in his Shoes . Q . Where did he tell you this ? Mr. Stock . In the back Room - not in Mr. Deveil 's hearing . Mr. Deveil . Mr. Stock declar 'd before me , that nothing that Lowdon had said should hurt him , except he was admitted an Evidence . Mr. Stock . I made no such Proposition to him : Mr. Deveil mentioned it to him , but I did not . Mr. Deveil said , you shall be admitted an Evidence , with this Proviso , that Mr. Stock can get his Goods again . Pris . Q . Did you contradict Colonel Deveil when he said that ? Mr. Stock No , I did not , because I was in Hopes of having my Goods restor 'd to me . Edward Simpson . About a Quarter after 8 at Night , I saw 3 Men at the Back of Burlington-Gardens , I heard one of them say , Why do n't you help him up with it ? and then they went off , and left an empty Shew-glass behind them . As to their Persons , two of them were pretty short Men , and it being dark , two of them seemed to be in blue Coats , and the other was in a white Coat . John Burt . I went in the Coach with the Prisoners from Mr. Deveil 's to the Gatehouse . Afflack denied that he knew any Thing of the Affair , but said to Lowdon , John ! make yourself an Evidence , save your own Life and do n't mind me , for I am a dead Man . Afflack I told him the Woman had sworn wrongfully against me , and he might do the same . On Sunday Morning was three Weeks , I was taken out of my Bed , and carried to Mr. Burt 's House . They fetch 'd six or seven Quarterns of Gin , and Jack Burt ask 'd me to be an Evidence ; I told him it was not in my Power , upon which he pull 'd out a long Cutteau Knife , and swore he would keep me in the House till he hang 'd me , unless I would make myself an Evidence . A Witness . I being Watchman to Mr. Burt , he charged me to assist him with these Prisoners down to the Gatehouse ; and I heard Mr Afflack say to Lowdon , make yourself an Evidence , and put me in the Information to save your own Life ! DEFENCE . Sarah Bradbury . Mrs. Stock came to my House about six Weeks ago , and asked me for the Constable . I told her I was his Wife , and called him to her . He asked her what she came about ? and she told him she was recommended to him by Justice Trent . She said she was undressing her Child in the back Room , and heard the Sash throw up . She then threw the Child out of her Arms , and ran into the Shop , and saw no Body at all ; that she immediately went to her next Door Neighbour and told him the Story ; and they went away together to Justice Trent , who recommended her to my Husband .

It was I that got the Warrant from Mr. Trent myself . Francis Weaker . I heard Mrs. Stock say she had been robb 'd of a Shew-glass , and that she had been at Mr. Bradbury 's . I ask 'd her if she had been at Mr. Lovet 's , for there perhaps she might see some of them , and she said she did not know who they were , but she had been inform 'd one of them was a short Man , and the other a tall Man . A Witness . I was at Bradbury 's when Mrs. Stock came in , she told him she was recommended by Justice Trent , and that she had lost her Shew-glass , but she was in the back Room dressing the Child , and could not see any Body . Why then ( said Bradbury ) how can I take them , if you ca n't describe them to me ? - Ship About six Weeks ago , I happen 'd to be drinking at Bradbury 's after I had done Work , and a Woman came in and said she had lost a Shew-glass .

A Woman . Alexander Flack and his Wife lodg 'd at my House , and he paid me Rent very honestly , and during that Time I never heard no Harm of him . Lowdon .

I was at Bradbury 's when the Woman came in , and he asked her if she knew the Person that stole the Shew-glass ; she said no , for she was in the back Room undressing the Child . - Bradbury .

I do n't swear to the Prisoner , because I was in Liquor when I was robb 'd , but I can swear to my Watch . He own 'd that he robb 'd me of it , and here is the Person he pawned it to . It was on the 13th of January , between 1 and 2 in the Morning , I had been with some Friends at the Brown Bear in Bow-street , about some Business , and when I parted with them I went into Earl's-Court , and was robb 'd of my Watch : my Hat was likewise taken away and carried about 20 Yards , and then thrown into an Area . After they had robb 'd me , some Friends took me Home , and then I missed my Watch . Q . You mention they , were there several Persons there ? Payne . Yes , I believe so . Q . Who was with you , that you say they took your Watch ? Payne . Only the Prisoner and the Evidence Gilson , as he informs me . Pris . Ask him whether he ever knew , or saw me before ? Payne . Not to my Knowledge . James Gilson . I know the Prisoner very well ; he lived Fellow-Servant with me at Spring-Gardens , Vaux-Hall , and was turn 'd away from thence about three Summers ago . He and I were at the Gaming Table in Vinegar Yard together on the 13th of Jan. playing at a Game card Reds and Whites ; - it is a House kept by one Mitford . After the Gaming was done , which was about 12 o'Clock at Night , we went to a Night-house , the Brown-Bear in Bow-street , and having brought myself very low , design 'd to sit up there all Night . Lowdon told me I might be at his Lodging , upon which we both went out , and just at the Corner of Earl's-Court this Gentleman Mr. Payne , lay quite down upon his Back . When we had got about two Yards past the End of the Court , Mr. Payne groaned , and I said to the Prisoner , Jack ! I 'm afraid here 's a Man dead ! I set him up against the Wall , and the Prisoner came and look 'd at his Buckles to see if they were Silver , and at the same Time push 'd Mr. Payne down , took his Watch from him , and ran cross the Way , and cry 'd , D - n your Eyes , Jack , why do n't you come along ? I did not go directly to him , but put Mr. Paines 's Back against the Wall again , upon which the Prisoner came over to me , and catch 'd me by the Arm , and lugg 'd me away for fear we should be taken , for he had got the Watch , he said . We then went down to the Bottom of Bow-street , and came up again to see whether he was gone or no . He said he supposed he had got more Money about him , and when we came to the End of the Court , there were two or three Gentlemen with him . After this , we went into Phoenix-Alley , and by the Light of the Lamp , the Prisoner opened the Watch , and said , it was a very good one , but it was very large , and would fetch about a Ridge . I asked him what he mean 'd by a Ridge ? and he told me , it was a Guinea , and that he would not sell the Watch that Night , but I should go Home and lie with him The next Morning he and Flack 's Girl went and pawn 'd the Watch in Fox's-Court , Gray's-Inn-Lane . Q . Was you with them then ? Gilson . Yes ; but I did not go into the House . He told me he had pawn 'd it for 25 s. but it seems he had thirty-five upon it , and he gave me Half a Guinea out of it . Q . Why did not he give you half ? Gilson . He did not give it me as my Share , but bid me go , and get a clean Shirt and a Waistcoat . Pris . Ask him if there were not two Women coming by when the Man lay drunk ? Gilson . Not that I perceived . Pris Did he see me take the Watch out of his Drawer ? Gilson No , but I heard the Chain gingle , and I afterwards saw the Key in his Hand . Pris . I took the Watch off the Ground , 4 Yards from the Man . Drift or assist him to set the Man up against the Wall ? Gilson . No , when I set him up , the Prisoner pushed him down again . Thomas Birch . I live with Mrs. Parsons , in Fox-Court . I know nothing of the Prisoner : but he brought the Watch in the Name of Peter Wise , and I lent him 35 s. upon it . My Mistress was then at Islington , in a bad State of Health , and I was entrusted by her to carry on the Business . - The Watch is worth 50 s. to any Body that wants such a Thing , and no more , according to my Judgment . Q . Have you any Part of the Profits ? Birch . No : I asked the Prisoner if it was his own Property , and he said it was , and he would fetch it out in four Hours Time , for he was in a great Hurry . Q . What was you to have besides the Money again ? Birch . The Interest , which was Ten-pence Half-penny . He brought it on the 13th of January , about half an Hour after 8 in the Morning . Mary Thornton . About the 12th of January , as near as I can guess , - I believe I can be certain as to the Day , because I am a Midwife and keep a Register : - Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Thornton . I have seen him about twice ; - his Father was a Watch and Clock-maker , and I remember something of him . I was called to a French woman 's in Shorts-Gardens , between six and seven in the Evening , and when I came from thence , I took my Servant and a Man with me , to see me safe Home , and just by Bow-street , there is a kind of a Bagnio , and I heard some Body say , There is a Man lies dead . It was Moon-light , and I saw that young Man at the Bar snatch up something from the Ground which shone very much . I have seen the Prisoner twice before , to the best of my Knowledge , and that is as much as I have , and he had the very same Cloaths on as he has now . Q . Did you see the Man that lay for dead ? Thornton . I saw something lie along ; I do n't know that I saw the Evidence , Gilson there : What I took most Notice of , was , the Colour of the Buttons on the Prisoner 's Coat . Jury . We desire she may be asked how she knew that the Prisoner was taken up ? Thornton . I live in Half-Moon-street , and heard that such a Neighbour 's Son was taken up . Q . Did you see the Man set up against the Wall ? Thornton . No , I was afraid to stay when I heard that the Man was dead , and I saw the Prisoner snatch up something , and it might be a Watch or a Snuff-box , for I did not stay to see . Elizabeth Hickson . I do n't know any Thing of the Prisoner , but I remember his Face : As my Mistress and I were coming along , I see him pick up the Watch , - I think it was a Watch . Q . Have you ever seen the Prisoner before ? Hickson . I do n't know him any farther than by seeing him as he went along . It was very light being Moon-light , and I observed no Man but him that picked up the Watch Q . Did you see the Prosecutor stand against the Wall . Hickson . No , I did not see him , for I was behind my Mistres , and had hold of her Arm . Q . What Time of Night was it ? Hickson . I know it was after Twelve , because the Clock struck just as we came out of the House in Short 's Gardens . Prisoner . My Father died about eight Weeks ago . Thornton .

I was alone in our back Shop , when two Men open 'd the Door and came in . I met them just at the back Shop Door , and immediately the first Man asked me if one Mr. Franklin liv 'd there ? The second Man made a sort of a Bustle with his Feet , and said , D - you , you are the Man . The third Man then put a Pistol to my breast , and said I was a dead Man , and indeed I was in such a Fright that I thought I was dead . I look 'd over one of their Shoulders , and saw the third Fellow making behind the Counter , for which Reason I cry 'd out , and the two Men who stood over me then st me , and likewise the third Fellow who had the Money , and in the Confusion one of the Pistols went off , as I thought by accident , upon which they ran out of the Shop . I then perceived that 3 Bags had been removed to a different End of the Counter from the Place where t hey first were , and there were upwards of a 1000 l. them . Q . Was the Prisoner one of those Persons ? Wethersden . I really ca n't say that he is . Ralph Hall . I live at Mrs. Downings the Corner of Clifford 's Inn in Fleet street . My Time being expired , my Mistress was paving me my Money , when I was alarmed by the Report of a Pistol I looked and saw 2 Fellows in the Banker 's Shop , and immediately a Man in Grey Cloaths ( something taller than the Prisoner ) opened the Door . The Prisoner was then behind him in the Shop , and as soon as the Door was open 'd , they both ran athwart our Shop towards Chancery-Lane . Mr. Simpson 's Footman presently came to the Door , seemingly in some Confusion , and cry 'd , Stop Thief ! I joined in the Pursuit , and in Bell-Yard the Prisoner was taken , but the other Man made his Escape . Q . When he was taken what did he say to you ? Hall . He desired us to let him go , for he was afraid of being Arrested Thomas Brooksbank On the 19th of January about 3 in the Afternoon , I had some Business at Mr. Brome 's Shop , facing Mr. Simpson 's , and heard the Report of a Pistol . Immediately two Men came out , and after them a third , and were pursued by Mr. Simpson 's Footman with a Cry of Stop Thief ! They ran up Chancery-Lane , and I went through the King's-Head Tavern in order to meet them , and just at Crown-Court I heard some People say , Let him go , it is only an Arrest ! Notwithstanding that , I follow 'd them , and a Gentleman who was then coming down the Court stopp 'd the Prisoner . I likewise took hold of his Collar , and he desir 'd me to let him go , for they were Bailiffs ( he said ) that were after him . James Barton . I was going down Crown-Court on an Errand , and met the Prisoner running as swift as he could with something in his Hand , but what it was I could not discern . He threw it under a Gutter which the Water runs through , and the Mob saying he had shot a Man , I put my Hand under the Gutter , and found this Pistol : - it was discharg 'd , and the Cock was broken off with the Fall . When the Prisoner was taken , and carried before Mr. Alderman Hoare , I was desir 'd to put my Hand up the Gutter again to search for the Cock of the Pistol : I did so , and found it accordingly . Mr. Thomas Wotton . On Sunday Morning , the Day after this Robbery was committed , I went to Newgate to see the Prisoner . I asked him how he could be guilty of such a notorious Thing ? He at first denied it , but upon my telling him that he would certainly be hanged . He cry 'd and fell on his Knees ; I then told him , I would make him no Promises of Favour , and he then said , that he work 'd at Hackney ; that his Brother fetched him from thence to get into better Bread ; and that they had walked about this Place for three Days to take an Opportunity to commit this Fact . He added , that it was his Pistol that went off , and that the Discharge of it was occasioned by his accidentally hirting it against the Side of the Counter ; and that Lucas ( one of the Persons not taken ) went into the Shop , and held the Pistol to the young Man , and then his Brother Lloyd went behind the Counter to take the Bags , and that he was to stand Centry with a Pistol at the Stairs Foot to prevent any Person 's coming up or down . Prisoner . I lived at Hackney , and Edward Lloyd and Robert Lucas fetched me away , and said they had got a Place for me , upon which I came to Town , and then I was disappointed . In a few Days I got another Place at Black-Fryars , where I staid about 7 or 8 Days , and then they took me from thence , and that Day we committed this Fact , they made me suddled ; they went in to ask for a fictitious Name , and Lucas clapp 'd a Pistol to that Gentleman 's Face . It is the first Fact I ever did , and I hope you will have Mercy and consider me . Guilty Death . 18. John Jefferies , was indicted for stealing 1 hundred Weight of Lead , Value 15 s. the Goods of Persons unknown . February 10th , Acquitted . 19.

Dorothy Preston , was indicted for stealing a Pewter Gallon Pot , Value 6 s. the Goods of Henry Biggs , Jan. 31 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 21 . + William Plummer , alias Cricklow , was indicted , for that he , on the 21st of January , feloniously made , and forged , a certain counterfeit Order in Writing , directed to Mr. Alexander , in Wood-street , & c. with Intent to defraud Wm Alexander , and Company , & c . Robert Hutton . It was on the 21st of January last , I was standing at Gray's-Inn-Gate , in Holborn , when the Prisoner came to me , and asked me , if I would go on an Errand for him . I told him , I would if he pleas 'd : he had then an half Sheet of Paper in his Hand , and we went into the Elephant and Castle together . I saw him write this ( here ) Paper , and he directed me to go with it to Mr. Alexander 's , a Brasier and I , against St. Alban 's Church in Wood-street . Accordingly I went there , and as soon as I came into the Shop , I delivered the Paper to Mr. Coking , Mr. Alexander 's Servant . Coking looked over the Paper , and seemed to suspect it : he carried to Mr. Combes , who asked me , if I came from Mr. Gough ; I told him , I did not know who Mr. Gough was , but the Person who gave me that Paper , was then waiting at the Elephant and Castle . Upon this , they scrupled giving me the Goods , and after I had waited half an Hour and upwards Mr. Combes sent two of his Servants before , and one of them went with me to the Elephant and Castle . When we came there , the Prisoner was gone from thence ; but had left Word , that he would be back in an Hour . When he returned , this Paper was produced to him , and he own 'd it was his Hand-writing , and wondered why Mr. Alexander did not send the Goods , for he had a Coffin to finish in haste in Bloomsbury-Square . The Paper was read . To Mr. Alexander , over against St. Alban's-Church in Wood-street . Send by the Porter , one set of Brass Work for Drawers , fifteen Handles , nine Locks , six Scutcheons , two Keys , one Tenant Saw , two sets of three Shilling Leather Castors , and a sett of Ditto Brass , for the Use of me , William Gough . Mr. Gough , I am an Upholder , and live in Westminster , I have dealt with Mr. Alexander heretofore , but I think it is near 2 Years since I had any Thing of him . Counc . Is that Paper your Hand-writing ? Gough . No , I believe it to be the Prisoner 's , for I have compared it with several Receipts which I received from him when he was an Apprentice , and the Writing agrees exactly . Mr. Combes . The Prisoner confessed over and over that this Paper was his Hand-writing . Hutton brought it to our House , and desired to have Goods upon it . He first gave it to my Servant , who delivered it to me , and we went to the Elephant and Castle , and found the Prisoner . He at first said , he would send for his Master Gough , but afterwards begged for Mercy , and owned it was his Hand-writing . Wm Coking . I am Foreman to Mr. Alexander and was the Person that received this Paper of the Porter . He told me , he came from the Elephant and Castle , and after I had shewn the Note to Mr. Combes , I went with another Man to see for the Prisoner . When we came to the Elephant and Castle , the Prisoner was gone from thence , but he afterwards came in , and I clapp 'd , him on the Shoulder , and ask 'd him how he did ? He asked me if I had brought him the Goods ? I told him , I did not care to give them to the Porter , upon which he told me , I was very much in the Right , but he should have been glad if I had brought them with me . He told me , the Paper was his Writing , but as he was Gough 's Servant he had wrote it in his Name . Mr. Gough . He never work 'd for me but two or three Days , and I never sent him with an Order to any Person . Prisoner . There has been somebody else in the Name of Mr. Gough as well as myself , and as to the Paper , that is not the same that I wrote . A Woman . I have known him a good while , but never knew him do any Thing before . Guilty Death . 22 . + Martin , alias Morgan Newland , of St. Clement-Danes , was indicted for unlawfully and feloniously procuring Tho Meredith , a Subject of our Lord the King , to serve the King of France , as a Soldier , ( he being a foreign Prince ) without the Consent of our Lord the King , under his Sign Manual first had and obtained , in Contempt of our said Lord the King and his Laws , & c. & c . The Councel for the King having opened the Indictment , observ 'd , that this Prosecution was grounded on a very salutary Law , which was made in the 9th Year of his present Majesty , in order to prevent the Strength of this Kingdom from being carried out of it into foreign Countries , & c. & c. Thomas Meredith . I am a Welshman , and belong to the second Regiment of Guards , and I believe it was three Weeks ago when I first saw the Prisoner . Counc . What Employment do you follow when you are not upon Duty ? Meredith . I used to work on the Keys between Billingsgate and the Tower . Counc . Where did you see him first ? Meredith . Upon the Keys . His Countryman told me he carried Men abroad , upon which I went to him , and talk 'd to him sometime . He told me he was then a Soldier in the Service of France , and if I would go with him , I should have 5 Pence Half-penny a Day , and 4 Loaves a Week , every one as big as a three-penny Loaf . Counc . Was that all you were to do , barely to go along with him ? Meredith My Brother came to me in his Soldier 's Cloaths , upon which the Prisoner seemed to be very much frighted to see him , but I bid him not be afraid , for he was my Brother . Then says he , we will go and drink a Mug of Beer : I told him , I had no Money ; never mind that ( said he ) I have Money enough . We then went over the Bridge , to a public House on the other Side of the Water , by the Borough-Market , and had some Beer , He told us there , if we would go along with him , we must go that very Night , and by the next Night we should get to Dover , and with a fair Wind , we should be over in 3 or 4 Hours ; after which , we had got about four and forty Miles to travel by Land . Counc . To what Purpose where you to go those four and forty Miles ? Meredith . I was to go with him to meet his Regiment . Counc . After this Conversation passed , what was done then ? Meredith . He told us , if we would go with him to his Quarters , he would give us a Dram ; accordingly I went with him to his Quarters in Kent street , very near the Red-Cow , and there we had 3 Quarterns of Gin , and some Bread and Cheese , and he told me , he had been to sell a Pound of Tea for 7 s. which cost him but 3 s. in France . Jury . We desire he may be asked , whether he then had his Regimentals on ? Meredith . Only my Regimental Waistcoat : my Brother was in his Regimentals . He called us up Stairs , and talk 'd to us a good while , and his Landlady came , and talk 'd to us too , and told us , when we came to France , we should live like Gentlemen . After we had been there some Time , the Prisoner came along with us , in order to sell my Brother 's Cloaths , but before he went away , his Landlady gave him some Money to buy a Breast of Mutton for us , and he desired her , as there were a great many Lodgers in the House , to send them to Bed before we came back . We went from thence into the Strand , and turned down to the Barracks before we went to the Public House , because my Brother wanted to ask the Serjeant what we must do with the Prisoner . Counc . Where did you go to after that ? Meredith . We went to the Coal Hole , a public House just by the Savoy . Counc . Who was there when you came to that House ? Meredith . There were 4 Welshmen of us in all , Joseph Griffith , Thomas Richards , and John Meredith . One of them Tom Richards , came along with me ; I met him in the Street . Counc . After you got to this Alehouse , what passed between you and the Prisoner then ? Meredith . We had three Pots of Beer , and then he and I went out of the Room , and I told him I had no Money to pay my Reckoning Upon that he said , here is 6 d. but it is upon the Account of your going with me , and you must make every Thing good when you get to France . Counc . Was there any Body else present then ? Meredith . No , we went out together , and he told me , I should have 3 or 4 Guineas Advance when I came over . Counc . You say , that when you went out together , you told him you had no Money , and that he then gave you 6 d. did he give it you to pay the Reckoning , or to go with him ? Meredith . I took it , and considered it as Money given to me to 'list to go with him , and he at that Time promised me 3 or 4 Guineas Advance when I came over . Counc . Did he promise any Thing else ? Meredith . Yes , five Peace Halfpenny a Day , and 4 Loaves a Week , every one as big as a three penny Loaf . When I came in again , the other Welshman and I told him we would all go with him , and he then shewed us his Furloe . One of the Men pretended to read it , but could not , upon which the Prisoner attempted to snatch it out of his Hand , and tore out a Piece of it , and then we took him Prisoner . Counc . See if that Paper is the same ? Meredith . Yes , this is the same , I wrote my Name on the Back of it when we were before the Justice . Q. Recollect as near as you can , the very Words he said to you when he let you have the Six-pence . Meredith . He said , here is 6 d. on the Account of going along with me , and ( says he ) after you go over , you must make every Thing good to me , and perhaps as soon as you are there , you shall have 3 or 4 Guineas Advance Money . Counc . What was you to be when you went over ? Meredith . He told me I was to be a Soldier in the King of France 's Service . Q . Did he say you was to go to his Regiment ? Meredith . I ca n't tell what Regiment I was to be in . He told me he was then a Soldier in France . Counc . Was you not to be in the same Regiment as he ? Meredith . I understood him . John Meredith . I am Brother to the last Witness , and was watching for Work at the Custom-House Key , and saw the Prisoner and my Brother together . I heard them talking a little , and then my Brother told me , he was a Soldier belonging to the King of France , and he asked me to go along with him . I was then in my Regimentals , and I asked him how I could go with him in those Cloaths , for I should certainly be taken up . Then , says he , you must have coloured Cloaths , and we must sell them that you have on ; and after this , we went down to the Savoy Barracks . Counc . Did you hear the Prisoner say any Thing to your Brother ? Meredith . Yes , he ask 'd him to enlist in the King of France 's Service as a Soldier . Counc . Did you go to the Borough with them ? Meredith . Yes , but I was going to the Savoy Barracks , and then the Prisoner said , we must have a Pot of Beer together . I told him I had no Money ; well then says he , I have so much Brass as that ; and then we went over London-Bridge to a House in the Borough . He there told me it was better living there than here , for we should have 5 d. halfpenny a Day , and four Leaves a Week ; said I , I have taken my Oath here to be true to this King , and I suppose I must take my Oath again when I go over . No , no , said he , there is nothing in it , you only kiss the Book . We then went with him to his Quarters in Kent street , and had some Gin , and he told us if we had a Mind to go with him we must go to Rag-Fair and sell our Cloaths . Counc . How came you not to go to Rag-Fair ? Meredith . I told him Monmouth-street was a better Place , for I had a Mind to ask some Advice before I took him up , and accordingly when we came to the Savoy I ask 'd Serjeant Taylor what I must do with him ? and he told me I must take Care of him . We went from thence to the Coal-Hole , Griffith and Richards were there when we came in , and I told the Prisoner that one of them might go with us . He had some Talk with them about listing , and then I went out and ca n't tell what passed afterwards . Counc . Did you see this Paper taken from the Prisoner ? Meredith . Yes , and he tore a Piece out of it in pulling it away : - this is the same ; I wrote my Name on the Back of it . Q . What was the Occasion of the Prisoner 's producing that Paper at all ? Meredith . Griffith said to him , How can I know that you belong to the King of France ? Why , said the Prisoner , I have a Furloe ; let me see it , said Griffith , and he then pulled it out directly . Counc . Did the Prisoner tell you what Countryman he was ? Meredith . Yes , he told me he was an Irishman . Joseph Griffith , The first Place where I ever saw the Prisoner , was at the Coal- Hole by the Savoy . I sat down and drank there , and these three Men told the Prisoner , that I would go along with him : Upon that , he talk 'd to me about enlisting myself , and I ask 'd how I should know that he belonged to the King of France ? for he might want to carry me to another Place . O ! says he , I have a Furloe from my Captain in my Pocket , and he desired me to go with him to be a Soldier in the King of France 's Service . Counc . Did he produce the Furloe ? Griffith . Yes , this is the same , I wrote my Name on the Back of it . Counc . How came that Bit out of it ? Griffith . I desir 'd him to lend me the Furloe , for I told him I could read French ; upon which Richards talked to me in Welch , and desired me to keep it : The Prisoner then wanted to snatch it away , and broke the Piece out . Counc . Did you hear him say any Thing about any Oath ? Griffith . I asked him if there was any Oath to be taken ? and he said , he would be bound that there was not . Counc . Did Thomas Meredith go out of the Room with the Prisoner ? Griffith . Yes , and when Meredith came in , he told me the Prisoner had given him 6 d by Way of Earnest , to go with him to France . Counc . Was that before or after you saw the Furloe ? Griffith . Before we saw it . Counc . How long was that before you seized the Prisoner ? Griffith About half a Quarter of an Hour , for he came in , and fell into Discourse with me by the Fire Side . Thomas Richards . I am a Welchman . My Comerade John Meredith , came to the Barracks , and told me the Prisoner wanted to enlist him in the French Service . The Prisoner was then at the Gate with Thomas Meredith . I went with them to the Coal Hole , and drank a Pot of Beer , and sent John Meredith to see for the Serjeant , but he could not find him . Then the Prisoner and Thomas Meredith went out together , and when they return 'd , Meredith told me the Prisoner had given him 6 d. to enlist him in the French Service . After that we had a Pot of Beer , and Griffith ask 'd the Prisoner how he should know that he belong 'd to France ? He then produc 'd this Furloe : I took it out of his Hand , and he tore a Bit out of it himself in endeavouring to pull it away . George Hutchinson . I was sitting at my Quarters ( the Coal Hole ) when the Prisoner came in with these Soldiers . They whisper 'd a long while together , and I thought they were enlisting him , and not he them . The Prisoner then desir 'd Richards to send for me out of the Room , and then they read the Furloe . I saw the Prisoner snatch it out of the Man 's Hand , and I carried it to my Landlord in the Bar , and he read it . Mr. Deveil . These People were before me , and sign 'd this Furloe . They charg 'd the Prisoner with enlisting Men for the French Service : He was obstinate for a considerable Time , but at last acknowledg 'd , that he was employed in this sort of Business by one Mackinnar , who ( he said ) was one of the French Officers . This is the Furloe that was produc 'd before me . Counc . Did the Prisoner say any Thing of any other People that were here on the same Business ? Mr. Deveil . Yes , he told me there were several others either landed , or just landing , upon which I pressed him to make himself an Evidence , but he refused .

Robert Fawdrey . On the 22d of this Month , I had been at the Mourning Bush , at Aldersgate , and about half an Hour past twelve in the Morning , I was walking very carefully down Bishopsgate-street , being a little Lame . I saw nobody in the Street , but very near that Part that is opposite to St. Martin Outwich Church , a Woman came up to me , and fastened round my Arm ; - my Dear ! said she , You look like a good-natur 'd Fellow , you will give me a Glass of Wine ! I , with an Imprecation , bid her be gone . She said , I am sure you will give me a Glass of Wine , and immediately pull 'd my Watch out of my Pocket . I cry 'd out Watch ; and directly the Prisoner said hold of me ; - the whole Transaction was not so long as I have been speaking . The Prisoner immediately tripp 'd up my Heels , and stood over me , and beat my Right Fore-finger in a terrible Manner . I believe it will appear by the Evidence that I shall produce , that this Man and the Woman were found talking together at Creed-Lane , about 12 o'Clock . I believe it was a Conspiracy between them , in order to meet the first Man they could . and I was the unhappy Victim of their Intentions . Q After you had been tripped up , as you have mentioned , what happened then ? Mr. Fawdrey . I call 'd Watch ! as I had done before , and a Person came up to me , who is the next Witness , William Palmer Hind , a Man I never saw before , but fortunately I believe for me , came in to save my Life . When I began to call Watch in this Manner , they both left me : the Woman ran up the Street , and the Prisoner ran down it , and was taken by the next Witness . Pris . Q Can you recollect what Hour the Woman met with you ? Mr. Fawdrey . Between 12 and 1 : - I did not meet with her , she met with me , and came forcibly upon me . Pris . Q . Was it near a Lamp ? Mr. Fawdrey It was very near the Lamp , and I knew the Prisoner the Moment he was taken . Pris . Q. I think you say , before the Man came up , your Watch was taken from you . Mr. Fawdrey . At the very Instant that my Watch was taken away , my Heels flew up , from whence I apprehend , that the Man was behind me . Pris . Q . Had you seen the Man before the Woman came up to you ? Mr. Fawdrey . No , nor her neither , for the whole Transaction was but half a Minute . Pris . Q . Can you guess how near to 12 or 1 this might be ? Mr. Fawdrey . It was so near , that I believe I could say it wanted about a Quarter of one . Wm Palmer Hind . On Tuesday Morning , or Monday Night , I will not say , I came from Mr. Darby 's in Stationer's-Court . It struck twelve o'Clock , and then the Landlord according to Custom , turn 'd every Body out of the House . - I believe it might be a Quarter after when I left the House . I crossed over the Way to the Corner of Creed-Lane , and while I was standing there , I saw the Prisoner and another Man , with a Woman in a white Cloak and a Velvet Hood . One of the Men , who was a tallish Man , cross 'd the Way from her , and when he had got about half a-cross , the Woman call 'd , Hog ! Hog ! I want to speak with you . He then came to her , and they all went down Creed lane together . I went on into Cheapside , where I stopp 'd to speak to one Dick Too , a Watchman , after which , I walked pretty leisurely till I came beyond the Change . The Prisoner and the Woman in the Cloak then passed me . I was not positive which Way they turned , but just as I came to the Corner of Cornhill , by Bishopsgate-Street , there stood a Hackney-Coach just cross the Street . I stopp 'd there to make the Coachman drive out of the Way , which being done , I went down Bishopsgate-street ; and when I had got 3 or 4 Doors down , I heard a Cry of Watch ! Hearing that , I mended my Pace , and there is a great Pair of wooden Gates on the Right Hand side of the Way ; and next Door to them , I saw Mr. Fawdrey upon his Back . The Prisoner and the Woman in the white Cloak were then upon him : What ( said I ) are you going to murder the Man ? and as soon as I had said that , the Prisoner turned about , and ran over the Way directly : - he ran one Way , and the Woman another . The Prosecutor said he had lost his Watch , upon which , after I had helped him up , I pursued the Prisoner . He ran about as far as the Pump , and then he turned his Back against the Wall , and asked me what I wanted with him ? I told him , the Gentleman said he had robbed him of his Watch , and he must go with me . I brought him over the Way , and as soon as Mr. Fawdrey saw him , he said , that is the Man that knocked me down . We then , with the Assistance of a Watchman , carried him to the Watch-house , and there he denied that he knew any thing of the Matter . Q. to Mr. Fawdrey . What Dress was the Woman in that came up to you ? Mr. Fawdrey . I take it that she had on a Linnen or Cotton Gown , with a light Colour 'd short Cloak , and a Velvet Hood . Pris . to Hind . Had you any Acquaintance with me before this ? Hind . I never spoke to him before to my Knowledge ? Pris . Q . How came you to take such particular Notice of a Man going along the Street , that you can be sure of him when you came to Bishopsgate street ? Hind . Because he then had a blue Handkerchief with white Spots about his Neck , and the same Coat on as he has now . Pris . Q . Was it dark or light when this happened ? Hind . I ca n't remember , but there is a Lamp just by the Tavern Door , at the End of Creed-Lane , and another at the Door over-against it . Pris . Q . What o'Clock was it when you saw them there ? Hind I believe it was a Quarter after 12 , because when the Watch go 12 o'Clock , Mr. Darby always turns the Customers out of Doors , and I only staid to pay my Reckoning and finish a Pot of Beer , and then I came away . Daniel Davis . Watchman , confirm 'd the Deposition of Palmer Hind , so far as it related to the apprehending the Prisoner . Thomas Hill , Constable . On Tuesday Morning , a little after one , the Prisoner was brought into the Watch-House . Mr. Fawdrey gave me charge of the Prisoner , for knocking him down , and rescuing a Person who had robbed him of his Watch . I asked Mr. Fawdrey in what Manner this was done , and he related it to me . He told me , he was coming down Bishopsgate-street , and a Woman laid hold of him , and asked him to give her a Glass of Wine : He bid her go about her Business , and he then perceived the Watch taken from him ; upon which he attempted to lay hold of her , and immediately the Prisoner knocked him down , or struck up his Heels . That as soon as he recovered himself , he called Watch ! and the Fellow then made off , and was pursued by Palmer Hind , who was then coming by , and with the Assistance of a Watchman , the Prisoner was taken . I asked the Prisoner several Questions , and he told me , he was going down on the other Side of the Way , and saw a Man and a Woman upon the Ground . He said , he went over to see what was the Matter , and when the Gentleman cry 'd Watch ! he ran - for Fear of coming into Trouble . Q . Did he say that he knew the Woman who was there ? Hill . No , he pretended that he knew nothing of her . It was insisted on by the Prisoner in his Defence , that he had been in Company with two Friends towards St. Giles 's , 'till late at Night , and that he came from thence with them only towards Bishopsgate-street ; that as he was going on one Side of Bishopsgate-street , he saw a Gentleman and a Woman struggling . That he went away directly , and soon afterwards the Gentleman complained of the Injury , and pursued him . Thomas Cumber . Last Monday Evening , between 7 and 8 o'Clock , the Prisoner and I were drinking at the Bull Head , in White chapple . He said , he was going into Catherine street , to receive some Money , and desired me to take a Walk with him . Accordingly I did , and then we took our Departure from thence , and directed our Way Home . Pris . Q . How long did you stay in Catherine-street ? Cumber . I believe we came from thence between 12 and 1 : Joseph Gibbs was with us . We came directly for the City , and we took our Leaves of the Prisoner at the End of Bishopsgate-street , and went towards White chapple . There was nobody at all in Company but we three , and when we parted with the Prisoner , I believe it was about 1 o'Clock , and I saw no more of him that Night . I am a Shoemaker , and live in the Minories ; Gibbs lives in White chapple , and I parted with him at the End of the Minories . I have known the Prisoner 20 Years , he is a Butcher , and I have bought Meat of him lately . He does not keep any Shop , but carries it about in a Tray . I never heard no ill Character of him , but he seems to take an industrious Care for his Bread . - I live in Well-Court , just by Mr. Fowler 's the Barber 's . Q . Did you not go into Creed-Lane as you were going Home ? Cumber . No , I do n't know Creed-Lane , but we turn 'd down no Lane at all . Joseph Gibbs . I was in Company with Cumber and the Prisoner at a Shop like a Chandler 's Shop in Catherine-street : - it was pretty near 9 o'Clock , and we staid there till a little after 12 . From thence we came with the Prisoner alone to the End of Bishopsgate-street , and there parted with him . There was no Woman in our Company , and we turn 'd down no Street at all till we came to Bishopsgate-street , where we parted with the Prisoner , and went on directly towards Whitechappel . I believe it was then very near 1 o'Clock , if not quite . As to the Prisoner 's Character , I have known him 20 Years , and never heard any Body give him an ill Character . Thomas Dunn . On Monday last about 1 o'Clock , I was coming from the Yorkshire Grey in Gravel-Lane , and just as I was going to cross to Thread-needle-street , I heard a Person say , Stop her , I have lost my Watch ! Presently a Woman ran by , as fast as if she had Wings , and I saw another Person like the Prisoner , and he was taken hold of . The Mob then began to gather , and I went Home , and saw no more of it . John Kitchen , Samuel Lewis , and James Cooper appeared to the Prisoner 's Character . William Hookham . I have known the Prisoner by Sight a great while . His Character is that of a common Sharper , and in general 't is very bad . Acquitted . 34.

The Councel for the King having open 'd the Indictment , and the Nature of the Offence , the Witnesses were called . Mr. Charles Ayres . I am one of the Attornies of the Exchequer Office in the Temple ; this in my Hand is an Information in the Name of his Majesty 's Attorney ; I had it from the King 's Remembrance Office . The Information was read , and was in Substance as follows , viz . Dated Easter-Term , 14th of his present Majesty ; Be it remember 'd that Sir Dudley Ryder , & c. in his own proper Person presents , that certain Merchants unknown , did between the first of May 1738 , and the Day of exhibiting this Information , import to Ratcliff within the Port of London , in a certain Ship by Way of Merchandise , 346 lbs . of Tea , 4 lbs . and half of Coffee , 51 Yards of Handkerchiefs , the whole amounting to the Value of 186 l. 1 s. the said Goods being liable to the Payment of Custom ; and that the said Merchants did unship and land the said Goods before the Customs and other Duties were paid , & c. and that the said Goods afterwards came into the Possession of Thomas Handley , he well knowing every Part of them to be imported , the Customs not being paid , against the Form of the Statute , & c. Counc . What is that other Parchment in your Hand ? Mr. Ayres . This is the Bail Piece ; it was taken before Sir Thomas Abney , who sign 'd it twice in my Presence ; first to the taking it , and then to the Justification . One James Durmot , and one Mr. Dowling , both swore in my Presence that they were worth-186 l. and that they were Housekeepers . [ The Recognizance was read . ] Counc . Was there any Notice given to you before this Recognizance was enter 'd into , of Bail to be put in by the Prisoner ? Mr. Ayres . Yes , I was employ 'd by Mr. Norton for the Prisoner , and I have the Notice in my Hand . Mr. Norton gave me the Notice , and I prepar 'd a Bail-Piece accordingly . It was in order to put in Bail for the Prisoner , on an Information exhibited against him by Mr. Attorney General , for treble the Value of a Parcel of run Goods , upon the Statute of the 8th of the Queen . Counc . Did you give Notice to the Sollicitor of the Customs ? Mr. Ayres . No , the Solicitor for the Defendant generally gives it . I ca n't take the Bail except it is approv 'd of , and here the Notice is endorsed . It was read . To Mr. Metcalfe , Sollicitor of the Customs . Attorney General against Thomas Handley by Information ; Bail for 186 l. Sir , Bail proposed for the Defendant in the above named Cause , are Robert Dowling of Gray 's Inn , Gent . and James Durmot of Adlam 's Coffee-House Lincoln's-Inn-Fields , near the Duke of Newcastle 's House . May 27 , 1741 . Your Humble Servant , Hen . Norton . Mr. Ayres . It is indorsed - Mr. Metcalfe does not object to the Persons within mention 'd , provided they justifie before a Baron , J. Tyton , for Mr. Metcalse . Counc . Who is Mr. Tyton ? Mr. Ayres . He is Clerk to Mr. Metcalse : I have seen him write ten thousand Times , and I take that to be his Hand . Pris . Ask Mr. Ayres whether I was in the Baron 's Chambers ? Mr. Ayres . He went before me to the Baron 's Chambers , and asked me whether it was necessary for him to go up ? I told him he might do as he pleased , and I think he staid below Stairs . Pris . Q . When this Matter was first mov 'd in the Court of Exchequer , did not I attend without an Order ? Mr. Ayres . I believe he did ; - I really ca n't say , but I believe there was an Order made for him to attend , and upon his Attendance the Court order 'd him into Custody . Heneage Norton . About the 20th of May , the Prisoner came to my House in Friday-street , and told me he had been arrested for running Goods , and that he wanted to give Bail to an Information . He inform 'd me that he was recommended to me by Mr. Russel in the Temple . I then told him he must get two honest Persons to propose to the Sollicitor of the Customs . He said he was a Stranger in Town , but he believ 'd he could get Friends ; and accordingly he came to me sometime afterwards , and gave me this Paper , on which are written the Names of Robert Dowling and James Durmot . He told me it was his own Writing , and those were the Persons who would stand as his Bail . Upon that , I wrote the Note which has been read , and gave it to Mr. Metcalfe 's Clerk ; and Mr. Metcalfe informing me that those Persons were not sufficient , I told the Prisoner of it , and he said Dowling was a Relation of his , a Man of Fortune , and lived in Grays-Inn ; and that Durmot was a Man of good Repute , and liv 'd at Adlam 's Coffee-House . I inform 'd Mr. Metcalfe of the Prisoner 's Answer , and he then said that Dowling was an ancient Man , but however if they would justifie , he would have no Objection to them . I then gave Mr. Ayres this Note that has been read , and desir 'd him to get the Bail Piece ready , and likewise desir 'd the Prisoner to attend me at the Exchequer-Office , or at Brown 's Coffee-House hard by , any Time that suited his Conveniency , and he said he would bring the Bail with him . Accordingly he came to me as I was at the Office-Door , and told me the Bail were ready , and were waiting at a Public House in Wych-street . I desir 'd him to bring them down to the Office , and soon afterwards Mr. Russel told me , that Handley and his Bail were come to a Public House just above Brown 's Coffee-House in Mitre-Court , and that they desir 'd I would come and read the Bail-Piece to them . When I came there , I saw two Men , who answer 'd to the Names of Robert Dowling and James Durmot , and then I read the Bail-Piece to them : the Prisoner , to the best of my Knowledge was present all the Time . I told them the Consequence of it , and that they might sign it there if they pleased ; upon which they took a Pen and Ink , and I observed that the old Man ( Dowling ) wrote a very good Hand . From thence I took them to the Exchequer-Office to Mr. Ayres , and I told him those were the two Persons who had sign 'd the Bail-Piece , and desir 'd him to go with them before the Baron . Counc . Did you go with them before the Baron ? Mr. Norton . No , the Prisoner and the rest went together , but I staid at the Office till Mr. Ayres came back . This is the Recognizance which I read to them , and I saw the two Persons sign it in the Names of Robert Dowling and James Durmot . Pris . Ask him if I did not bring him Money to the Exchequer-Office ? Mr. Norton . I told him in Matters of this Nature , I was oblig 'd to give the Clerk in Court 40 s. and I expected some Money of him before the Bail was taken ; this was before the Bail Piece was sign 'd ; and he was not gone five Minutes before he brought me 4 Guineas . Pris . Q . Did not you ask whether Durmot was the Master of that Coffee-House ? Mr. Norton . I asked when I went in whether Dowling and Durmot were not there , and they both answer 'd . George Russel . About the Beginning of June last , the Prisoner came recommended to me , and told me he had been taken up on an Information , and came up to London to put in Bail , upon which I recommended him to Mr. Norton . He told me one Mr. Dowling would become his Bail , and likewise one Durmot of Adlam 's Coffee-House ; but after that , he said there was some Difficulty with the Coffee-Man , and he was afraid it would not do . Instructions were afterwards sent to me , and I wrote this Bail-Piece by Mr. Ayres 's Order . I was likewise present when the two Bail subscrib 'd it ; - it was at a Public House called the Vine , just by Brown 's Coffee-House , and I saw them sign their Names ; Mr. Norton was present at the same Time ; I gave him Notice that they were there . Mr. Dowling I have known many Years by Sight , and he sign 'd first : the other Man I did not take much Notice of , but I saw him write - Durmot , after it had been read over to them by Mr. Norton . Counc . Was the Prisoner present ? Russel . I think he was , but I ca n't be positive to that . After this when we were coming out of the House together , Mr. Norton asked me in the Passage for the Fees : I told the Prisoner of it , and he ran away to get the Money , and in a few Minutes brought it to Mr. Norton . Counc . Did you go with them before the Baron ? Russel . No , I went no farther than the End of Mitre-Court . Counc . How came you not to see Durmot 's Face ? Russel . I had no Curiosity , for I apprehended him to be the Man of Adlam 's Coffee-House . James Macdurmot . I have kept Adlam 's Coffee-House about a Year and 3 Quarters to the best of my Knowledge . I never was Bail for any Person , nor ever sign 'd any Recognizance . Counc . Look upon that Recognizance , and tell the Court whether you ever sign 'd it in one Part or another ? Macdurmot No , I never did : I always spell my Name - Macdurmot ; but the English call me - Durmot . About the middle of May last , the Prisoner and one Conrade came to my House and called for Coffee , and other Liquors . Conrade called me into a Back Room , and told me there was a poor Man accused on Account of some run Goods , therefore desir 'd me to bail him . I told him if it was my own Brother I would not ; and sometime afterwards I heard that somebody had bailed the Prisoner in my Name . Counc . How came you to hear of this afterwards ? Macdurmot . One of my Neighbours informed me that some Persons had been to enquire my Character , and whether I was worth 186 l. Mr. Ayres being ask 'd whether this Witness was the Person who went with him to the Baron 's Chambers , answer 'd in the Negative . Counc . to Mr. Norton . Was that the Person who sign 'd this Bail-Piece ? Mr. Norton . I ca n't take upon me to say whether he was or not . Mr. Russell . I ca n't say whether he is the Person , - I took no manner of Notice of him . Macdurmot . I always take my Receipts in the Name of Macdurmot , but a great many People call me Durmot . Counc . Did the Prisoner ever ask you to be bail ? Macdurmot . No , not that I remember . Pris . Q . Did you never consent that Bail should be put in in your Name ? Macdurmot . No , I never did . Pris . Q . When this Matter became public , did you never declare , that you would deny it , and that you would hang one , and transport the other ? Macdurmot . I never did . Pris . Q . Did not you employ Mr. Williscot to draw a Bond of Indemnity ? Macdurmot Dowling came to my House with a View of making it up , and I not knowing any Thing of the Law , went to that Gentleman 's House to ask his Advice , and he would not have any Hand in the Action . I desired one Mr. Grosby to ask Mr. Tomlin if Bail was put in , and at that Time it was not ; but afterwards I heard that Bail was put in , in the Names of Dowling and Durmot . Pris . Q . Have you not a Brother ? Macdurmot . Yes , his Name is Brian Macdurmot ; I believe he knew as much of the Prisoner as I did . Pris Q . Was I a Stranger to you when Conrade came to your House ? Macdurmot . Yes , and he did not go into the Room with us . Thomas Dennis . I was ordered to enquire Macdurmot 's Character . I asked for him by the Name of James Durmot . I enquired of 3 or 4 People , and every one of them knew him by that Name . I was told by them , that the Person who kept Adlam 's Coffee-House , was James Durmot . Councel . How came you to enquire after him ? Dennis . I belong to Mr. Metcalfe , and had Notice given me to enquire after him , because he was proposed for Bail for Thomas Handley I am acquainted with Mr. Tyton 's Hand , and I take this to be his writing : When Bail is proposed , this is the usual Way of signifying their Consent . Pris . Q . Did you not enquire whether the People knew who kept the Coffee-house ? Dennis . I shewed them the Note in which was written James Durmot of Adlam 's Coffee-House , and they said they knew him . Pris . Q . Did you ask for Durmot singly , or Durmot of the Coffee-house ? Dennis . I might ask both ways . I likewise enquired Dowling 's Character of a Porter at Gray's-Inn-Gate , and told him , he was propos 'd for Bail , and the Porter said , he would go and ask him whether he would be Bail or no , for perhaps he might get 6 d or 1 s. by the Job . Pris . Q . What answer did he bring ? Dennis . I ca n't tell , I believe he delivered it to Mr. Tomlin . Samuel Green gave an Account of his enquiring for Durmot , and that he asked at Adlam 's Coffee-house whether one Durmot lived there , and was answered by the Woman of the House that he did . Pris . Q . What Reward had you for goingupon that Enquiry ? Green . None at all ; I belong to Mr. Graves , who carries on this Prosecution , and have not had so much as Money with my Subpoena . DEFENCE . It was urged on Behalf of the Prisoner , that he being arrested in the Country , came up to Town , and was recommended by Russel to Mr. Norton ; and it being necessary to put in Bail , he propos 'd his Uncle Mr. Dowling , and having some Acquaintance with Conrade , who knew Mr. Durmot , they went together to Durmot 's House . That Conrade went out of the Room with Dowling , and sometime afterwards , Conrade sent him ( the Prisoner ) Word , that Durmot would become his Bail ; and accordingly a Person came with Durmot 's own Brother , and that the Bail-piece was then sign 'd . Robert Dowling . There came a Porter to me , belonging to Gray 's Inn , to desire me to bail the Prisoner . I said , I would , because I knew him , and I thought he would surrender himself in discharge of his Bail ! The Porter informed me , that he was sent by Mr. Metcalfe , and if I would stand as one of his Bail , the Man at Adlam 's Coffee-house would stand with me . Accordingly the Prisoner sent me a Messenger to meet at the Swan in the Butcher-Row , and while I was about some Beef-Steaks , he came in . There were several People there , and one of them they told me was Brother to Macdurmot , and there was another who took upon himself to be James Durmot . While we were there , Mr. Russel brought in the Bail-Piece , and I read it over to them . Q . Was that Man ( Macdurmot ) the Man that din 'd with you ? Dowling . No , the Man who dined with us , and who called himself James Durmot , was tall than this Man . We adjourned from the Swan to the Vine , in Mitre Court , where we sign 'd the Bail-piece . I sign 'd it first , and then the other Man sign 'd it by the Name of James Durmot . Q Was the Prisoner present then ? Dowling . He was in and out , but whether he was present then or not , I ca n't tell . I have heard that he served a Bookseller , a Brother of mine 14 or 15 Years very honestly . I never saw him till May last ; when he came up to Liverpool to discharge his first Ball , and I took it very well of him that he had so great Regard for his Bail . Counc . Did the Prisoner go with you to the Judges Chambers ? Dowling . He went with us as far as Brick-Court , but whether he went up or not I ca n't tell . Counc . When you were at the House in tho Butcher-Row , who told you that the other Person was James Durmot ? Dowling . I was told so by the Prisoner : I understood by him and the rest of the Company , that he was the Man . There were in Company one Nethany , and a Man in a red Waistcoat , and one Molloy . Counc . Do you know that Durmot 's Brother was there any otherwise than as you heard ? Dowling . No . The two Durmots came in while we were at Dinner , and I believe they were directed to us , but by whom I ca n't tell . After we had given Bail , we all agreed to go to Durmot 's Coffee-House , to take a Glass , and I followed them thither . We sat in the Public Room , and all the Persons who were there , knew we had put in Bail . This Man ( Macdurmot ) was not in our Company , but served us with Liquor as we called for it . Q . Had the Brother of Durmot any Conversation with the Master of the House ? Dowling . No , none that I know of . Francis Moron , Robert Dillon , and Thomas Meighan , gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest Man . The Jury withdrew to consider of their Verdict , and after some Time returned , and found the Prisoner , not Guilty 40 + George Cheek , was indicted for stealing a Silver Dog , Value 12 s the Goods of Christian Heland , in his Shop , Jan. 23d , Guilty 10 d.

I was in the House of one Robert Cattle in Holford's-Alley , with an Acquaintance of mine who was almost drunk , and he wanted to lay himself down . I was afraid to leave him , so I sat down myself , and fell asleep by the Prisoner 's Side . She sat on my left Hand , and another young Woman who is here , sat on my Right : - I was neither drunk nor sober , - I was between both . This was about 10 or 11 in the Day Time , on a Monday Morning ; - we had been strolling about all Night . After I had missed my Watch - I did not charge the Prisoner with it , for I locked all the People up together in the House for fear they should run away . Elizabeth Spore . I saw the Prisoner lean towards John Paine as he sat by the Fire , and take the Watch out of his Pocket , - upon my Word . I never saw the Watch after that ; but he lock 'd us all up about it .

I took the Prisoner with two of my Beasts , and one of my Neighbours ; - he was driving them ? along a Lane near Endfield Wash , which is about a quarter of a Mile from the Chace where I put them to graze . I asked him where he had them and he said , he was going with them to Essex , to put them out to keeping . He told me he bought them of a Man at Belbar , who had several more to dispose of . We secur 'd the Prisoner , and went to Belbar to see for this Man , but no such Person was to be found . John Harvey . The Prisoner told me , that he bought the Bullocks at Belbar at one Abram Fellows 's , at the White-Hart , of one John Jones a Welchman ; - they were small Welch Cattle , and he said he gave 32 s. 6 d. a Head for them . I being a Headborough , took him before his Majesty 's Justice of the Peace , and he himself was at the Charge of pawning a Stock-Buckle for 3 s. to send a Man to Belbar . Samuel Parker , Constable . Last Monday was 3 Weeks , I was at the Nag's-Head when the Prisoner was brought in by the Headborough . He said he bought the Beasts at Belbar . At his Desire Saggers and I went to Belbar , and found his Story to be false . As we were carrying him to Newgate , he own 'd he committed the Fact , and wished he might die before Sessions came on .

Dudley I happen 'd to fall among this Parcel of Women on Sunday Night last , about 9 o'Clock . Three of them stood at the End of Thatch'd-Alley , in Chick Lane . One of them laid hold of me on one Side , and another on the other , and one behind me pulled me into the Entry . They took me into a Place on the right Hand Side , but fearing I should make too much Noise there , they carried me up one pair of Stairs , When we came there , there were four or five People besides the two Prisoners ; and Cooper bit me a Knock on the Face first , and took my Stick from me . Then they began to try for my Watch , I therefore kept it in my Hand , and twisted the String round my Finger ; but they bit my Fingers to make me let it go , and then I put it into my Bosom . Upon this they threw me upon the Bed , and with the Assistance of 2 Men , took the Watch from me . Thomas Ward , Constable . On Sunday Night about a quarter after 10 o'Clock , I came into the Watch-house , and the Prosecutor told me he had been robb 'd in Thatch'd-Alley . I took two Watchmen with me to the House , and when I came into the Ground Room , there was a sick Child there . We went into the upper Part of the House , and met with no body , but when we came into the Ground Room again we saw the Prisoner Cooper . The Prosecutor no sooner saw her , but he said she was one of the Persons who assisted in taking his Watch . Accordingly we laid hold of her ; - there was a Man in the House whom we likewise took to the Watch-house , but the Prosecutor not swearing positively to him , I discharg 'd him . When Cooper was brought in , she desir 'd that we would go and search on the Bed for the Watch , and we accordingly did , and found it under the Coverlid of the Bed . A Watchman . I went along with my Master Ward to Carter 's House , - the Prosecutor shew 'd us the House , and we found Cooper in the Ground Room ; and in the one pair of Stairs Room we found the Prosecutor 's Stick . There was a Man in the House , and my Master order 'd me to take Cooper out while he examin 'd him ; and then Cooper said it was hard she should suffer , for she was Innocent , and she asked me if we had look 'd on the Bed , for perhaps the Man might drop the Watch there . My Master and I afterwards found it on the Bed under the Rug . Pris Carter . Ask the Prosecutor whether I brought him into the House ? Dudley . No , I believe Mrs. Carter was not concern 'd at first , but came into the Room afterwards : - She came about the middle of the Fray , when I had four upon me ; and she held my Hands , or did something that Way , as the rest did . Carter . Ask the Watchman whether I keep the House ? Watchman . It always goes in her Husband 's Name ; they live in the lower Appartment ; I ca n't tell whether they have the whole House . Francis Carter . Elizabeth Carter was in my Company at David Brook 's in Thatch 'd Alley , from half an Hour after 7 till within a Quarter of eleven . Rebacca Bristol and Sarah Sheriff never heard any Harm of Carter before . Elizabeth Brocas . Carter came into my Room that Night , about 8 o'Clock , and I do n't know that she was out of it till almost eleven : - She brought a Bit of Meat , and sat down and eat it , being a Neighbour . Robert Harrison . All I have to say is , that I have known her 16 or 17 Years , and she always was industrious and careful . Ann Clayton I know both the Prisoners to be very honest Women . Mary Cecil . I have known Carter a great while , and know no Harm by her , but - that she is a Neighbour of mine , and never saw an unhandsome Word come out of her Mouth . I heard the Prosecutor say in the Old-Bailey Yard , that he believed he had taken a false Oath , and they were not the Women , but he would keep them confined till he found the right Persons : - he said so upon my Oath . Prosecutor . I never said any such Word . John Cooper . I was in Carter 's Company from 8 o'Clock till about 11 : - I took Notice of it because I was along with a Smith , and he did not leave Work till 8 o'Clock . Elizabeth Cooper . I have known Cooper from a Child , and never heard no Harm by her . Mary Beard . I have known Carter about 5 or 6 Years : she was a good Neighbour and an honest Body as far as ever I heard . Robert Harrison . Carter has nothing to herself , but the lower Apartment in the House ; - I am upon Oath , and God forbid I should take a wrong Oath Both Acquitted . 59. Jane Hale , for receiving and housing the said Peterson , knowing him to have committed the aforesaid Felony . Jonas Rogers . I live in Lemon street , Goodman 's Fields . On Saturday Night last , I had been out , and when I returned , I found my Wife in a great Surprize , and some Neighbours informed me that they had seen three Men in my Shop . I missed the Goods mentioned in the Indictment , and therefore got a Warrant to search a House which I suspected , at Saltpeter-Bank . When we went in , we found the Prisoner Hale there , - it was her House , and the Gentlemen drew their Swords and Daggers , and threatened our Lives . There were three Thieves , and four Women there : Hale was one of them , and she gave the Men the Key to get the Weapons , in order to drive us out of the House . Mary Wissingham . On Saturday Night about Dusk , I was going Home towards Whitechapple , and saw the Prisoner Peterson , at this Gentleman 's Door ; - he keeps a Shoemaker 's Shop . There was another Man in the Entry , who seemed to be opening the Hatch . I keeping a stand in Rag-Fair , knew these People bore a very bad Character , and was frighted ; and so I went to my Neighbour 's House , and told her I believed the Gentleman would be robbed ; upon which , she left her Shop and went to see them . Elizabeth Pretty . The last Witness came to my Shop , and told me , my Neighbour was like to be robbed , and I went and saw the Prisoner and two more , who have made their Escapes . I met Peterson and another , as I was going to tell my Neighbour . The other Man had an Apron as full of something as it could hold . I had been threaten 'd by these Men before , therefore dust not take any Notice of them ; but I went to my Neighbour Mrs. Rogers , and told her that her House was beset by Thieves She started up as I was talking to her , and out started a Man from the same Side as my Neighbour sells his Shoes on . Mrs. Rogers got up immediately , and said , she was robb 'd and undone , and fell into Fits presently . Pris Peterson . Did you ever know me to be a Thief ? Pretty I detected him once in taking a whole dozen of Stockings from a Neighbour ; there were three of them , and I am sure he was one of them . Nicholas Abel , The first Proceeding of coming into the Thing was , that I was robbed last Friday Night . I happened to be along with a Customer in my Way of Business , and my Wife came to me , and told me , my Shop had been robbed . On Saturday , about 7 at Night I was informed , that Mr. Rogers had been robbed much in the same Manner as myself , a little after Candle-light , and therefore went to his House , and thought by our going together , we might meet with the Thieves who had robb 'd us . He happened not to be at Home then , but on the Monday following , we took out a Warrant to search Hale 's House . When we came in , there were the Prisoner and two more , who were the three Thieves of whom we had Information One of them I knew by Sight , because he is the Captain of New Prisons Son , I told the Constable - there was his Prisoner , and then one of them said , - D - you have is a Search Warrant ! Why do n't you give me the Key ? Upon that , the Prisoner Hale put her Hand into her Pocket , and he made Use of a great many vile Expressions , and took the Key from her , and said , he would shew us what we came to search for . He open 'd a Closet , and took out a Sword and two Doggers , or other dangerous Weapons , and after they had each taken one , he cried , - Now clear the House , or else D - n you , I will pin you up , or cut you down directly ! Upon that , we having nothing to defend ourselves , the Constable went out first , and we being in Danger , were very ready to follow : - My Wife was the last in the House . The Prisoner took the shortest Weapon of the three ; - they were all ready drawn in the Closet , and he held it up as if he was making an Offer to push at us . We told them , we had a search Warrant when we went into the House ; - that was the first Thing we mentioned : the Woman ( Hale ) was there at the same Time . After they had turned us out of the House , they all made their Escape backwards , and in a turning by Grace's-Alley , I saw the three Men together . I caught hold of the Prisoner Peterson , and a Knife was taken from him , which is here to be produced , which is not a proper Thing for People to carry about them . This is the Knife , and I found it open in the Prisoner 's Pocket . - It appeared to be a French Knife about a Foot long Wm Wiman We went with a Warrant to search the House , and a tall , thin Man , almost 6 foot high , asked me what I wanted : - It was the Prisoner Hale 's House , she owned it was hers before the Justice I told them I had a Search Warrant , and they would not give us Time to shew it them , for the tall Man Cavanah , called the Woman B - n , for some such Thing , and ask 'd her for the Key , and said , he would shew us something ; after which , he pulled out a Sword , and swore he would stick me . Q . Had Peterson any Weapon delivered to him ? Wiman . I ca n't tell what Weapon he had , for when the other Man pushed at me , I turned my Head . The Prisoner Hale was there all the Time , for she gave them the Key to get the Arms . Ann Abel . I am Wife to Nicholas Abel , and went with him and the others to Hale 's House in Saltpetre Bank . The Constable was going to knock at the Door , but a Woman came out , and we got in without any Resistance . There were three Men sitting in the Kitchen , - Peterson was one , the Captain of New-Prison 's Son another , and a Man in a grey Coat was the other . Cavannah , the tallest of the three , asked us what we wanted ? Rogers and the Headborough told him , they had a Search Warrant . Upon that , he ran up Stairs , and left Peterson and the other in the Room . We heard a rustling above Stairs for 2 or 3 Minutes , and then Cavanah came down and damn 'd the Prisoner Hale , and bid her give him the Key ; upon which he said , - D - n them , I will shew them what they search for . He then opened the Closet , and took out three drawn Weapons , one of them was longer than the others , and that he kept for himself , and gave the others to the Prisoner Peterson and the other Man . He told us , if we did not quit the House that Moment , he would stick us against the Wall . The first Man that turn 'd his Back was the Constable , and the others were very ready to follow him . I let my Husband go out first , because I thought they would not hurt me , and Cavannah swore if I did not go out , it should be the worse for me . When Peterson was apprehended , I saw my Husband take this Knife out of his Pocket . Peterson . This Woman ( Hale ) used to wash Shirts for me , and I went to her House to get one . I had ben at Sea , and thought these People were coming to press me , therefore I took this Knife to drive them out of Doors . Hale . I desired these People to search every Corner of the House a great many Times . Both acquitted . 60. Susannah Kelly , was indicted for stealing five 36 s.

Ask him whether he was not very much in Liquor when I was carried to the Watch-house ? Ottiwell . I was in Liquor when I went into the House ; but the Fright made me sober . - Kingsley .
