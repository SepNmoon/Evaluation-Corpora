I went to her again on the 5th of November , and she desir 'd me to come again about 10 o'Clock at Night ; for she said , she was going out , and should hardly come in again before that Time . And , Mr. Hill , says she , You have often promis 'd me a Glass of Wine when I paid you any Money , but you never gave it me yet ; I wish you would bring it with you to Night , for now my Husband is out of Town I have most need of it , and therefore it would be a Deed of Charity . I left her , and at the Time appointed return 'd with a Bottle of Wine . I knockt at the Door , and she look 'd out of the Window . What , says I , are you going to Bed ? If you are , I 'll come to Morrow . She answer 'd , No , no , stay a Minute , and I 'll open the Door . I thought I heard her Husband 's Voice , but I was not certain ; however she came down and let me in ; Now , Says she , I see you are as good as your Word , but I can not drink except I eat a Bit first ; I wish you 'd step to the Chandler 's Shop and fetch a Roll and Cheese . I went and turning back , I saw the glimpse of Somebody go from her Door . When I came in , we sat down in the Kitchin , and drank a Glass or two . Now , says she , suppose my Husband should come and catch us , - Why what if he should , says I , it would not be the first Time that he has seen me in this House , - I know that , says she , but yet he 'd certainly Murder as both . I told her , then I would stay no longer , and got up to go , when presently Somebody knock 'd at the Door . O , says she , 't is my Sister Molly , step up Stairs a Minute , and I 'll send her away again presently ; for I dont know what she may think , to see us here together at this Time of Night . I went to the Stair-head , she open 'd the Door , and hearing that it was her Husband , I came down again , and bade him welcome Home ; G - D - ye , says he . What Business have ye with my Wife ? And so knock 'd me down with his Cane , and beat me unmercifully , and in the mean while his Wife took a Couple of Spike Nails , and nail 'd the Door with them . - Then he swore that he would have my Rings ; upon which I pull 'd then off , and gave them to him , and rising up , I then clos 'd with him , and threw him , upon which his Wife catch 'd up a knife and swore she 'd Murder me ; but I got the Knife from her , and threw it into the Fire . The Prisoner fell upon me again , What do you mean , says I , by abusing me thus ? Do you intend to murder me ? If I have done you any wrong , send for an Officer , and I 'll surrender my self peaceably . By G - says he , I 'll be your butcher , if you do n't immediately give me a Note for 50 l. I told him I 'd never do that . Why then look ye , says he , I 'll make but one Word with you ; if you wont return me my Note for 12 l. 10 s. and give me another Note for 5 l. You shall never go out of this House alive . I told him , I had not got that Note about me . He swore he would search me ; and thrusting his Hand into my Pocket , he took out a French Six-pence , which was all I had about me then . And then they let me out . The Constable thus depos 'd . When I went to the Prisoner 's House in White-Horse-Alley in Cow-Cross to apprehend him , the Prosecutor and he fell to Fighting , I follow 'd to part them ; the Prisoner 's Wife shew 'd me the Spikes with which she nail 'd the Door , when she kept the Prosecutor in and I for fear she intended to do the same by me , run into the Chamber , and forced her Husband away with me . The Prisoner thus made his Defence . I had been about 3 Weeks in the Country , and returning on the 5th of November , about 10 at Night to my Habitation , I saw a Light below , and knock 'd at the Door , but No-body answering , I thought my Wife had been asleep ; upon which I knock 'd harder , and then she came to the Door with only one Petticoat on , and her Gown wrapt . loosely about her ; I was surprised to see a Bottle , a Glass , and Watch upon the Table . I ask 'd her who those Things belong 'd to , she told me to Mr. Hill . Where is he ? says I : Above says she And what Business has he there with you in the Dark ? says I , and so I ran up Stairs , and found him standing in his Shirt ; for I suppose he was just got out of Bed , and could not really find his Cloaths in the Dark . I was very much surpriz 'd , for before this Accident , I thought I had got as virtuous a Wife as any in England But having a Cane in my Hand , I told him if he was so hot , I 'd cool his Courage for him ; and to giving him 3 or 4 Strokes across the Shoulders , I bid him get out of my House ; however , I let him put on his Cloths , and then came down with him , and was going to fetch a Constable ; but he cry 'd and beg 'd of me not to do it ; for he should be ruin 'd , if ever it came to his Father-in-law 's Ear ; and therefore , if I would but make it up , he 'd give me any Satisfaction ; I told him , I desir 'd nothing of him , but a Bond never to come into my Wife 's Company again ; and then he gave me his Rings for a Pledge , till he gave me such a Bond . As for the French Six-pence , he gave it me to fetch a Mug of Beer , that we might drink and be Friends at parting . Rebecca Terry thus depos 'd . I heard the Prosecutor say , that he gave the Rings to the Prisoner ; and then , says I , how could you swear that he took them from you by force , Why , says be again , If Swearing will do his Business he shall not want for that . Others depos 'd , that he said , If hanging will do his Business , be shant want for it . Several Witnesses gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest Man . The Jury found him guilty . Death . Williamson Goodbarn , of St. Clements Danes , was indicted for stealing 17 Guineas , and a Receipt for 10 Shares , in the Subscriptions of the London Assurance , value 92 l. 10 s. the Money and Goods of James Bains , in the House of James Bains , on the 18th of November . James Bains thus depos 'd . I keep the Angel Inn behind St. Clement Church , and the Chequer Inn upon Dowgate-Hill . The Prisoner had lodged at my House for several Months . I lost 10 Guineas at one time , 2 at another , and 3 at a third time . I came home one Tuesday Evening , and found the Prisoner standing by the Fire , and having Occasion to look for something in my Scrutore , I went up Stairs and mist my Subscriptions ; when I came down , the Prisoner was gone , and did not come home all that Night . The next Day I acquainted my Broker with my Loss , and by his Advice , I stuck up Advertisements in Jonathan 's , and about Change-Alley . That Evening Mr. Woodly told me that he had bought those Subscriptions , which he had since seen advertis 'd ; by his Description of the Man that sold them , I judged it to be the Prisoner . I went with Mr. Woodly to his Bankers , on whom he had given the Prisoner a Draught . The Banker told us that he paid part of that Draught with a 50 l. Bank Bill ( Numb . 211 ) and the rest in Gold . I then went to the Bank to stop Payment of that Bill , and from thence home , where I found the Prisoner in the Kitchen , in Company with another Man . I took no Notice of any Loss , but ask 'd him if we should not have a Bowl of Punch together . He answer 'd , with all his Heart . While the Punch was making , I sent privately for Mr. Woodly , but the Prisoner ( as he afterwards told me ) mistrusting that I had some Design against him he went away , and I saw him no more that Night . The next Day which was Thursday , about noon , a Porter came and told me that some Gentleman wanted me at my other Inn upon Dowgate-Hill and that I must come immediately . I suspected that there was some Trick in this , and so desir 'd John Hitchcock to dog that Porter where ever he went , which he did , and I followed him at a proper Distance . The Potter instead of going to Dowgate-Hill went to Charing-Cross , and there in a Trunk Makers Shop I took the Prisoner and brought him back in a Coach in the Angel-Inn , where I sent for Mr. Woody , Mr. Sheppard and another . Mr. Woodly could not swear that the Prisoner was the Man that sold him the Subscriptions , but the other two Men were positive of it . In order to secure him till I could find a Justice of the Peace , ( for I had been to several of their Houses , but none of them were in the Way ) . I arrested him in an Action of 40 l. for his Board at my House , my Friend Collet , having first ( by endeavouring to accommodate the Difference ) got from him the same 50 l. Bank Bill , that he receiv 'd of Mr. Woodly 's Banker . Whilst he was under this Arrest , he promis 'd to make me any Satisfaction and give me good Security to make it up . I told him if he 'd give my Friend a Note on demand for 100 l. I 'd discharge him , which he did , and that I that Night withdrew my Action for 40 l. and the next Morning arrested him for the 10 d. John Hitchcock deposed , that he heard the Prisoner confess that he took the Guineas at three Times . Mr. Jones thus depos 'd . The Prisoner when I first charg 'd him with the Fact , deny 'd it ; but pressing closely , he confest to me , that he himself with a Key of his own , opened Mr. Bain 's Scrutore , and took out the 17 Guineas at 3 Times , and at another Time took the Subscriptions ; I was desir 'd to ask him , ( which I did if Mr. Bains 's Sister , or his Maid were at all concern 'd in it ; he answer 'd There was no Person but my self that was any Way Concern 'd in it , God forbid that I should accuse the Innocent , I would give 300l . I make it up . And yet the next Day he told me that Bains 's Sister did give him that Money , and those Subscriptions , and assured me at the same Time , that there was a Familiarity betwixt himself and her . William Conner depos 'd , that he heard the Prisoner say , that he himself open 'd the Scrutore with a Key of his own , and took out the Money and Subscriptions ; and that neither Mr. Bain 's Sister , nor any other Person had any Hand in the Fact . The Prisoner thus made his Defence , I never had any of the Guineas , but I own that I had the Subscriptions , and sold them to Mr. Woodly ; but they were given me by Mr. Bains 's Sister . I was saying one Day , that I wonder 'd I had not receiv 'd Money from my Father as usual ; upon which she told me , she could help me to something that would fetch Money , and then gave me the Subscriptions which she could easily come at ; for she was intrusted with the whole House , and kept all the Keys . The Monday before he took me up , he turn 'd his Sister out of Doors , on the Account of his having lost the Guineas , and he had sent the Maid away before , on the same Suspicion . He knew that there had been some great Freedoms betwixt me and his Sister , and he press 'd me to marry her . And that Night I was arrested . I made some mention to him of the Favours she had granted me . Upon which he said he had rather have given 100 l. than I should have said any such Thing of his Sister . Since I have been under this Trouble , I have requir 'd him to procure his Sister to appear upon my Tryal , but he has refus 'd it . To this Mr.Bains thus reply 'd . My Sister never was trusted with the keys of my Scrutore ; I never knew that there was the least Affair betwixt her and the Prisoner ; I dont believe that he ever so much as touch 'd her Lips , for they had no Opportunities of being alone together . I turn 'd her away because she was saucy ; for when I had sent the Maid away , truly my Sister said , if the Maid went , she 'd go too , and I told her she might if she would , and so she took Huff , and away she went . When the Prisoner told me , that he had taken some Freedoms with her , I said , Indeed , ( I wonder you should say so of my Sister , for I dont believe that she was ever guilty of any such Thing in her Life . Other Witnesses depos 'd , that the Prisoner said that Bains 's Sister gave him the Subscriptions ; but that he would give his Note or do any Thing to make the Matter up rather than his Father should hear of it ; and that Notice was left with Mr. Bains for his Sister to appear ; to which he answer 'd he could not produce her , and if he could he would not . Several Witnesses gave the Prisoner a good Character , and the Jury acquitted him . Daniel Pinner , was indicted for stealing the Money of Mary Picart , in the House of John Merregeot , November 17 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation .

THe Town being still imposed upon , and the publick Prints daily cramm 'd with the fulsome Praises of infallible Specificks , Areana 's , Italian Bolus 's , and many other Quack Medicines , it is thought necessary to caution the Unwary against them ; there being no Danger that the judicious Part of Mankind should be deceived by them . Why are these Medicines exposed to Sale at Toys-Shops , unless to skreen the Preparers of such notorious Cheats from the Resentment of injured People ? Are the bell Physicians , or most eminent Surgeons , ashamed of their Prescriptions and Preparations ? Must the Severe Affiction of an Impostor 's Pocket induce Men to ruin their Constitutions ? Can we believe that Charity for others deplorable Circumstances will prevail on such a one to publish what he dare not own ? Are not the Degrees of the Veneral Disease various ? Are not Mens Constitutions vastly different ? Was there ever a Remedy always infallible ? Do not the same things agree with one , and prove Poison to another ? Or are there not a sufficient Number of able and experienced Physicians and surgons , who practice in Publick , and whose Credit depend upon their skill and Success ? The most ingenions Prescription may sometimes fail : And will any one depend upon the Apparatus , or an unknown Author , who never sies you , or consults your Distemper , and who , when he has sufficiently cheated you , will refer you to the Advice of some able Surgeon ? Shall a Man 's Misery incline him to he credulous , and prevail upon him to make himself more miserable ? Or can any one foolishly fear that a Surgeon will expose his Patient ? For your own Sales , therefore apply to some Man of skill and Probity who appears to justify his Practice , and answer for its Success ; such a one invites you to his House , the first on the Right-hand in Crane-Court near Fetter Lane in Fleet-Street , a Golden Heart and Lamp at the Door ; who , from the most nauseous Degree of that unhappy Disease , will receive you to Health and Vigour , speedily and securely , without Salivation . Enquire for the Surgeon , who may be advised with any Morning till Twelve a Clock , and from Three to Ten at Night . N.B . There being a young Surgeon in the same Court ( to Prevent Mistakes ) take Notice this is the first House on the Right Hand .
