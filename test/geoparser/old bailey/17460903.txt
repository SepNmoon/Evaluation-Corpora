The Soldiers got up at once , but I did not examine their Pockets . I took a Candle , and went into the Room where this Man was a-bed ; there was another Man , a Corporal ; he said , he had heard some Money chink ; so I said to this Philip Allen , You must get up too , to be examin 'd ; for I had no more Suspicion of one than the other : Accordingly he rises up , and said he wanted , to speak to me ; I ask 'd him what he wanted , and went into a little Closet , and he down 'd upon his Knees to me ; God bless you , said he , do n't tell my Serjeant , and I will tell you where the Money is : I told him I would not tell his Serjeant , because I wanted to bring the Thing out ; so he confess 'd the Fact . I said to him , What did you do this Thing for ? He said , he had got the Foul Distemper , and he got that Money on purpose to get him cur 'd . He went back to the Bed where he lay , and he took the twelve Shillings and two Pence , and Half a Guinea ; he took it from between the Bed and the Sacking .

( to the Prisoner ) What have you to say for yourself , by way of Defence ; or have you any Witness to your Character ? Prisoner . My Lord , I lodg 'd in this Mr. Terry 's House ; and , as I was going to Bed , I had a Candle in my Hand , and found these Things in my Way . I did not put the Money into my Pocket , but laid it on the Bed 'till I should hear some Body enquire for it . I heard them make a Noise , examining the Soldiers ; and I was getting up at the Time Mr. Terry came into the Room ; I told him I had the Money and the Buckles ; I call 'd to him , and gave them to him ; I did not steal , non-break or pick a Lock . If I had a Mind to commit a Robbery , I had had a greater Opportunity , which I did not . Guilty , 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 285.

About the Beginning of June , I came up to London , and took Lodgings at Mr. Egleston 's , Tobacconist in Fleet-Street ; I pack 'd up my Things in a Portmanteau to go in the Country : After I had been in the Country about three Weeks , I look 'd for some of my Pocket Handkerchiefs , and I miss 'd them ; I miss 'd three Shirts and five Handkerchiefs . When I miss 'd my Shirts , I wrote to Mr. Egleston . Q . ( to Anne Egleston . ) What have you to say concerning this Woman ? Egleston . Sir , the Prisoner was a Servant of mine about six Weeks ; when I wanted a Servant , she came to me ; I sent for a Character of her where she directed me . In the Time she was with me she took these three Shirts and five Handkerchiefs . When the Gentleman wrote to me , he said , if I could answer to the Maid 's Character he would set down by the Loss . Her Master said she was a washing some Handkerchiefs ; so she brought up a Handkerchief mark 'd B . B. I told her ( my Credit was at Stake as well as her 's ) and I desired she would be free and open , and let me know the whole ; she told me , she had pawn 'd the Shirts in Eagle-Street ; she begg 'd that I would let her have Money , and she would fetch them again ; so we sent to the Pawnbroker 's , and she had pawn 'd them in the Name of Clark ; she said her Husband used to pawn Things in the Name of Clark , and he had learn 'd her the Way .

Weight ; these Bristles , and some in the Bag , are mine . Q . Where was this Bag and Bristles found ? Yeomans . These were sent to me by an unknown Hand , and the Bag was taken from the two Prisoners ; that is all I have to say . Q . ( to George Stanley . ) What have you to say ? Stanley . Nothing to say , my Lord , but that this Original March offer 'd these Bristles to my Wife . Q . Was you present ? Stanley . I was not present . Q . Do you understand any thing of it , besides what your Wife told you ? Stanley . My Wife is a Person that sells Goods , Bristles , and Hair Brooms , & c. about the Streets . On this Side of Leicester-Fields , this Original March took Hold of the Handle of one of the Brooms , and ask 'd her some Questions , and said that he had a large Quantity of Bristles to sell : I also saw him myself , and he offer 'd these Bristles to Sale ; I ask 'd him what he would have for them , but he could not tell ; he ask 'd me what I would give for them , so that I found he was ignorant ; not only so , but I thought within myself that they were stolen , because there is no Person that has such a Commodity but Brush-makers . He told me he had a large Quantity of these Hairs to dispose of , 5 or 600 Weight . I follow 'd him the whole Day , but would not seize this small Parcel , in Hopes of finding the biggest . It was on the 25th of July ; I was a whole Day with him , and spent my Money upon him . I went again the 26th , on Saturday Morning ; when I came there he was a Bed . I order 'd the Landlord to call him down ; I ask 'd him to drink ; I said Mr. March , as you have such a large Quantity of Bristles to sell , I would have you let me see them ; he said he had no more at that Time , but if I would take them in Part , he would make them up a Quarter of a Hundred , and that he had them for a Debt of a Gentleman that was then in Ludgate , which was false , for he had them of Mr. Yeoman 's Maid in St. Thomas Apostles ; She put the Bristles in this same Bag , and he ( Original March ) took them of her , in order to pay a Debt of Sarah Deacon 's , ( the other Prisoner ) to one Mrs. Collins , in Tyburn Road . I carried him before the Justice , and he said Sarah Deacon took the Hairs , and gave them to him . Then they were examin 'd before my Lord , both of them own 'd the Fact ; one was committed to Newgate , and the other to Wood-Street Compter . Court . Now recollect the very Words . Stanley . As near as I can guess , the Woman said she took the Hairs , and gave them to O . March , and desir 'd him to sell them to pay this Debt to Mrs. Collins . Q . Did March say he saw Deacon take them and put them into the Bag ? Stanley . Yes , and that she gave them to him afterwards , and said , March , if you can take a few of these Hairs , and pay this little Money , if you have a Conscience that will do it ; and March said Conscience be hang 'd . The Prisoner Deacon said she was sorry in one sense , and yet glad in another ; for if it had not been found out , Things might have been worse . Jane Stanley , On the 24th of July this Original March overtook me ( on this Side of Leicester-Fields ) with Brushes , & c. He ask 'd me what I could afford to give him for such Brooms without Handels ; he told me he had a great many Brush Brooms of all forts ; he said also that he had a great Quantity of Hairs on Account of a Gentleman that ow 'd him Threefcore Pounds , that was in Ludgate . He took me to his Lodgings ; when I came there I expected to see Brushes and Brooms , & c. so he brought me down that Bag with Bristles in them ; he ask 'd me 20 d. a Pound for them : I told him I believ 'd they were worth more , but I told him I was not so good a Judge as my Husband , but I would send him in the Evening . My Husband went the next Morning , and spent the whole Day in order to have the other Quantity . March , the Prisoner , said he had kept Company with Sarah Deacon in the Way of a Husband , for four Years ; that he lay with her at several Times , eight Nights in all ; that she gave him these Hairs to pay a Debt to Mrs. Collins , which she borrow 'd of her in her Necessity . Q . ( to Edward Speak ) What have you to say in this Affair ? Speak . I have nothing more , than that I was present at the Time when the Goods were stopt . The Prisoner , whose Name is Original March , has acknowledg 'd he had the Bristles from Sarah Deacon , Servant to Mr. Yeomans , in Thomas Apostles ; that he had lay 'd with her frequently there , and that she went for his Wife , but he was never married to her ; she used frequently to let him in after her Master was gone to Bed , and to let him out in the Morning before they were up , and the last Night she gave him these Bristles . When the Fellow was stopt , I knowing Mr. Yeomans , I sent Mr. Stanley to give him Information ; he came back to let me know that the Maid was secur 'd , accordingly they were carried before my Lord Mayor . Court . Speak first as to March . Speak . March acknowledg 'd he had them from Mr. Yeomans 's Maid , to pay a Debt to one Mrs. Collins . Q . Did Sarah Deacon say any Thing ? Speak . At the Time she was much surpriz 'd , but as it was done , she could not help it . She acknowledged she had given the Goods to Original March , and he was there that Night . Q . ( to Prisoner March ) In the first Place what have you to say in your Defence ? Prisoner . This Woman , please you my Lord , had put up these Hairs in a Bag , and she said she had come honestly by them . Q . ( to Deacon ) Have you any Thing to say by Way of Defence ? Katharine Yeomans . I am Wife to Thomas Yeomans ; all that I have to say of her is , that she is really capable of being a good Servant , and behav 'd very well 'till she got into Company with this Fellow : He came into the House , and lay there when he took the Goods out . I believe he has been the Ruin of her , and , my Lord , I would pray that she may be forgiven . Both Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 292.

Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Would you ask this Witness any Questions . Prisoner .

Carrier . Between Eight and Nine o'Clock , I think , on Saturday Night ; he did not stay at all with me ; I gave him the Coat , and the Coach stopp 'd in Denmark-Street . Q . ( to Thomas Thornhill ) Will you please to tell the Jury what you know of this Matter ? Thornhill . Smith , the Prisoner at the Bar , brought Mrs. Harding 's Servant to my House , which is Anne England , the Witness . Q . What Time of the Night ? Thornhill . It was dark when they came to us ; it might be between Eight and Nine o'Clock at Night when the Maid came ; there was , I believe , six Boxes taken out of the Coach ; she came into my Shop , and said , Where is the Coach Seat . The Boy , Thomas Smith , at first , deny 'd that he had it at all , and that he believ 'd it was put into the other Coach : That the Gentry were coming with it . I believe these were his very Words . Q . Did that Answer satisfy ? was there any farther Enquiry made ? Thornhill . The Maid herself said , that she saw it put into the Boot ; upon which he then said , it was lost at my Door ; that somebody had stole it after he had been charg 'd with it : He said my Servants had robb 'd him . I said they were my Servants , and I would be answerable for them . Q . Was there any body with him ? Thornhill . There was a Boy with him , but I ca n't swear to him . Court . Then Thomas Smith fell a swearing , and said some of your Servants had robb 'd him ? Thornhill . Yes , most impudently , Sir . Q . What pass 'd then ? Thornhill . He would have gone away from the Door , and I told him he should not go 'till the other Coach came ; I expected Mrs. Harding and Miss . He then said he would stay 'till it did come . Q . And did he ? Thornhill . I went up to inform Dr. Harding of the Affair ; he was in my House . While I was telling the Doctor what he said , he drove away . Dr. Harding flung up my Windows to bid him stay ; he answer 'd , with an Oath , D - n his Blood , or something of that Kind , he would not stay for him , nor no-body else . Q . Which of them said that ? Thornhill . Smith was then upon the Box , I believe , Sir . I think , when I said he should stay , the other Boy went away . The Morning after Smith was taken up ; when he came to my House in order to be taken before Sir Thomas De Veil , he deny 'd that he had any body with him at all , 'till I had given him some particular Account of it ; then he confess 'd that he had somebody with him . Q . Was you before Sir Thomas De Veil ? Did any thing remarkable pass there ? Thornhill . No , Sir , I think not . Q . ( to Dr. Harding ) Please to mention what you know concerning this Affair . Harding . I must say this , as a pausible Plea for the Prisoner ; it did rain pretty hard when I call 'd to him , and ask 'd him whether he would not stay , to comply with his Promise , 'till the other Coach came up to ' clear up the Matter ; he answer 'd , D - n your Blood , I will not stay for you , nor any Man breathing . When I was before Sir Thomas De Veil , the other Prisoner confess 'd he was along with Thomas Smith the whole Time . Q . ( to Daniel Herd ) What do you know of this Matter ? Herd . Upon the 6th of July , early in the Morning , I receiv 'd a Note from Dr. Harding , to go to Mr. Edger ; which I did , and told him that I wanted to enquire of the Man that drove the Coach last Night : So we went into Tyburn Road , and call 'd him up , and I desir 'd him to go with me to find out the Man that drove the Hackney Coach last Night , No . 190 . So he ask 'd another Man if he knew the Prisoner at the Bar , calling him by a Nick-Name ; he said , Yes , and that he had burnt almost a whole Candle that Night , and he did not come home ; another Man made Answer , he believ 'd he was asleep in the Haylost : The Man went down , and came up again , and said he was there . So I spoke to him , and ask 'd him if he knew any thing of a Coach Seat that was lost last Night ; the Coachman said to him , Did not you and I put it into the Coach ? then he said he did carry it to St. Paul 's Church-Yard , and that he set his Feet upon it ; but at first he said nothing of it , which made Mr. Budby give him some rash Words , and lay to him , Did not I help you to put it in myself ? Then he answer 'd , he had carried it to Mr. Thornhill 's in St. Paul 's Church-Yard . The Man that brought me the Note for my Master told me , that there was another Man came along with him . I ask 'd Smith whether somebody did not get upon the Coach at Rathborne-Place , when he drank a Dram with him ; he said , Yes , but he went no further ; but afterwards confess 'd that he went along with him all the Way . Q . ( to the Prisoner Smith ) What have you to say by way of Defence ? Prisoner . Please you , my Lord , I was call 'd from St. Anne 's Place ; there was this Box to carry , and it began to rain ; I went for my Great-Coat , and when I stopp 'd in Denmark-Street every Thing was safe .

We could not take the other two as we were not provided . Q . ( to John Harvey . ) Have you any thing to say about this Affair ? Harvey . I saw these Jews crying about the Streets , they were enquiring for the Constable , and the People sending them about from one Place to another . They said they had been robb 'd by three Men near the Green Dragon , one of a Knife and the other of Six-pence ; I said , if you go to such a Place you will find the Constable making himself merry among some of his Friends : However I follow 'd them to the Constable , who did not care for going ; but I insisted upon it , and told him I would go with him ; then he said he would go . We went down to the Red Lion , and says the young Jew , this is the Man ; with that we seiz 'd him . Then the other Fellows said , d - n you he shall not go with you ; with that one of them knock 'd Grimson down , and had like to have serv 'd me in the same Manner ; but by the Assistance of a third Person we did make shift to secure this Gentleman at the Bar .
