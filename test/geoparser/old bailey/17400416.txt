Mary Wharton , of Christ-Church , London , was indicted for stealing a Pewter Gallon-pot , val . 4 s. the Goods of Benj . Marriot , March 13 . Mr. Marriot . On the 13th of March last , the Prisoner came to my Shop , and asked the Price of Salt . - I keep an Oil-shop in Newgate-street . She told me her Mistress wanted some Salt , and had ordered her to wait in my Shop till she came ; and therefore , with my Leave , she would sit down : and accordingly she sat her self down by a Vinegar-Cask ; near which the Pewter Gallon-pot stood . After she had set a while in the Shop , she got up , and bid me weigh the Salt , while she stepp 'd thro ' Newgate for 2 Gallons of Gin , and then she would come again . As soon as she was gone , I miss 'd the Gallon-Pot ; upon which I went after her , and took her in Phoenix-Court , with the Pot upon her . She told me , her Necessity made her do it , and begg 'd that I would not send her to Newgate , but rather let her go to Bridewell . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 192 . + William Isgrigg , of St John Zachary , was indicted for stealing 9 Pair of Mens Silver Shoe-buckles , value 5 l. 4 Pair of Silver Knee-buckles , val . 20s . 3 Pair of Womens Silver Shoe-buckles , val . 24 s. 3 plain Gold Rings , val . 36 s. 2 enamell 'd gold Rings , val . 12 s. a gold Ring set with 5 Stones , val . 3 s. a Silver Snuff-box with the inside gilded , val . 8 s. 7 Silver Stock-buckles , val . 21 s. and 3 Pair of Silver Stock-clasps , val . 18 s. the Goods of William Gould , in his Dwelling-house , Feb. 24 . William Gould . The Prisoner was my Apprentice , and had served me above half his Time . His Father lay very ill , and his Mother begg 'd of me to let him go and see him , for he was ( she said ) at the Point of Death . I gave him Leave to go , and after he had been absent a Fortnight , I sent for him to come home : but he sent me Word , that the Physicians had given his Father over , and , as it was not expected he would live over that Night , he desired I would suffer him to stay one Night longer . I consented ; and his Mother sent him Home next Morning , ( as I was informed ) but he did not come near me till Sunday the 24th of February last , ( which was a Fortnight after he had been sent Home ) and then my Servant-Maid informed me , she let the Prisoner into the House , a quarter after 8 in the Morning , before I was up . The next Morning ( Monday ) I got up between 7 and 8 , and casting an Eye upon my Shew-Glass , I thought the Goods look 'd thin , and that several Things were wanting . Upon this I examined my other Boy , and was satisfied that he knew nothing of them ; and the Prisoner being absent again , I suspected him , and upon searching after him , I took him in Hanging-sword-Alley in Fleet-street , on the Wednesday Night following . He was carried to the Watch house , and there we found the gold Ring with 5 false Stones upon him , and nothing else . That Night he was sent to Bridewell , and the next Day we carried him before Sir Robert Godseball , where he confess 'd he had pawn 'd several Pair of my Buckles , Stock-buckles , and Stock-clasps , which are now in Court . This is the Stone-Ring which was found upon him at the Watch-house , and it is mine . I am pretty sure it was in the Shew-Glass , when we took it from the Window , into the Shop , on Saturday Night , and I miss 'd it , with the rest of the Goods , on Monday the 25th of February , in the Morning . John Hartwell , Constable . I took this Ring out of the Prisoner 's Pocket , at the Watch-house . John Coombes . These Buckles were sealed up before Sir William Billers . They are the same which the Prosecutor swears were taken from him , and I found them at the Pawnbrokers . I have Warrants in my Pocket against two of them ; their Names are William Wilson , James Crocket , James Jarvis , and Thomas Oldfield . The Constable produced several Pair of Silver Buckles , which he had found at the Pawnbrokers . Mr. Gould . These are my Goods ; and I saw them on Saturday in my Shew-glass , which was taken into the Shop at Night . The Shop is part of my Dwelling-house , and I saw the Glass in the Shop on Sunday , but did not examine it till Monday Morning . The Prisoner is between 19 and 20 Years of Age . - I have another Apprentice , one John Priest , who has served about a Year of his Time ; and my Servants have the Liberty of going into the Shop . Prisoner . I have no Questions to ask , - I 'll give the Court no farther Trouble , - I acknowledge my Guilt , and hope you 'll consider me . Gawen Nash . I went with Mr. Gould to search after the Prisoner , and the next Morning after we found him ; I did , I believe , extort a Confession out of him , by promising him Compassion , if he would tell where the Things were . Prisoner . My Master did promise me Mercy . Mr. Nash . I told him it was his best Way to make Retaliation to his Master , by discovering where the Goods were : and he confessed more Goods than we have here in Court , and told us where they were to be found . He informed us , that Thomas Oldfield , who keeps a publick House in Tavistock-street , had many of the Goods ; we went to him , and he was with us before the Justice , who bound him over to appear here with the Goods , and give Evidence , but he is not come . The Court ordered him to be sent for ; be accordingly appeared , and produced the Goods he had in his Possession , which were restored to Mr Gould , by Order of Court ; after which he , with the other Pawnbrokers were very severely reprimanded * > for their Behaviour by the Court . * The Sale of Goods , wrongfully taken , to any Broker or Pawn-taker in London , Westminster , Southwark , or within two Miles of London shall not alter the Property . - If a Broker , having received such > Goods , shall not , upon Request of the Owner , discover them , how , and when , he came by them , and to whom they are conveyed , be shall forfeit the double Value thereof to the said Owner , to be recovered by Action of Debt . Stat . 1 Jac . I. c. 21 . 1 6 , 7 . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 193. Mary Domingus , of Allhallows Barking , was indicted for stealing a Silver Spoon , val . 10 s. the Goods of Eliz . Wilson ; and a Velvet Hood , val . 6 s. the Goods of John Axx , Jan. 27 . Mary Axx . My Husband , John Axx , is a Tal-low-Chandler we live at the Corner of Seething-Lane in Tower-street . The Prisoner came to our Shop the latter End of January last , with a Child in her Arms , and bespoke 10 Dozen of Candles ; after which she begg 'd leave to sit down with her Child in our Kitchen : we did not refuse it , so she came in and sat down by the Dresser , where the Spoon and my Velvet Hood lay . She staid some Time in the House , and dined with us ; and told us the Candles were for her Aunt , who kept the Jewel-Office in the Tower and as we had served that Person before , we were civil to the Prisoner , and she staid with us from 11 in the Morning , till 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon : she then went out , telling us she would go to the Box-maker 's , and order a Box to be sent , into which the Candles were to be put . As soon as she was gone , I miss 'd the Spoon and Hood , which lay upon the Dresser , and remembering I had seen both of them in her Hand , while she was in the House , I went after her to the Box-maker 's , but she had not been there , nor did I see any thing more of her , till last Wednesday , and then I happened to see her going to take Water at the Old Swan . I taxed her with having taken the Goods , and she confessed she had sold the Spoon to one Basil Denn , who lives on the Left-Hand Side of the Way , upon London-Bridge . My Husband went to Denn 's , and enquired for the Spoon , but it was never produced . She owned she took both the Spoon and the Hood , in the Presence of me , my Husband , and my Mother ( Eliz . Wilson ) ; my Servant was in the House the same Time she took them . Elizabeth Wilson . When my Daughter , ( the former Witness ) li't of this Creature at the Old Swan , she went with her to a Publick-House , and sent for me ; I never saw her before that Time , in my Life , and that was last Wednesday . I desired her to confess , where she had sold or pawn 'd the Things , that we might have them again ; telling her , if they were pawn 'd , I would redeem them . She told us , we could not have them again : I know ( said she ) you can not , for the Spoon is sold on London-Bridge , thro ' the Gate , on the Left-hand-side of the Way , and the Hood I have sold to a young Woman of my Acquaintance for 3 s. Mary Swanson . The Hood and Spoon were upon the Dresser , when the Prisoner came into the House , and as soon as she was gone , we miss 'd them . John Axx . I went to Basil Denn , a Goldsmith on London-Bridge to enquire after the Spoon ; and he told me , he had bought several Spoons , but could not tell the Marks of any . I was present on Thursday , when the Prisoner was carried before Mr. Alderman Perry , and she confes 'd there , that she had stole the Hood and Spoon , and had sold the Spoon for 7 s. and it weighs 10 s. or 10 and 6 d. and I serv 'd Denn with a Subpena this Day , but he is not here . Prisoner . I had been at the Excise-Office that Day , and I own I din 'd at Mr. Axx 's , but I did not take the Things . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 194 . + Elizabeth Wilcox , of St. Butolph , Aldgate , was indicted for stealing 15 Yards of printed Cotton , value 30 s. the Goods of Sarah Walker , in her Shop , March 18 . Mrs. Walker . On the 18th of March last , I was call 'd down Stairs into my Shop , and found the Prisoner , and several Neighbours in the Shop : My Servant charged her with having taken 15 Yards of printed Cotton , which was mine , and she said she had nothing to say , for she had had the Cotton ; those were the very Words ; and she hoped I would not prosecute her . This is the Cotton , it lay upon the Counter when I came down Stairs ; 't is mine - I am a single Woman . James Woodward . The Prisoner came into the Shop , on Little Tower-Hill , with another Woman , on Tuesday the 18th of March last , under pretence of buying something . It was in the Morning , but I ca n't tell the Hour . The Woman that was with her , bought enough to make a Child 's Frock , and paid 3 s. for that , and a Bit of Cambrick . When they came in , they asked for printed Cottons , to make a Frock ; and I shew 'd them this very Piece , but they did not like it then ; so I let it lie on the Counter , and shew 'd them Purple and White , some of which they bought . When the Prisoner 's Companion had paid me the 3 s. the Prisoner went out of the Shop , and her Companion stood at the Door talking with me : but suspecting I had lost something , I stepp 'd out , and took the Prisoner 5 or 6 Doors beyond our Shop ; and when I had got her back into the Shop , she took this Cotton from under her Apron , and gave it me into my Hand . Prisoner . I am innocent of taking the Linnen . The young Man ( Woodward ) took it up in the the Shop , but whether the other Woman left it there , or not , I ca n't tell . I did not give it him into his Hand ; he took it off the Ground himself , and said , here 's the Linnen . Woodward . She herself deliver 'd it to me , from under her Apron , and her Companion desired me not to pull her about so . The other Woman I let go . Prisoner . And she is run away . Woodward . I am sure the Prisoner is the Woman that deliver 'd the Goods to me , when I had brought her back . They were above a quarter of an Hour looking on the Goods ; and this Piece of Cotton lay under the other Goods I had shewn them . Kezia Tingey . The Prisoner own 'd her Crime , when she was brought back , and begg 'd prodigiously that she might not be prosecuted : she owned she had stole the Cotton , and that she had been drawn into it , by bad Company . This was on the 18th of March last , in Mrs. Walker 's Dining-Room . A Witness . I have known the Prisoner 19 Years : she has had 11 Children , and I nursed the youngest Child 3 Years . 'Her Father 's Name is Mason , - a very honest Man ; and she did keep a Publick-House , the Sign of the Swan , facing St Ann 's Church , in St. Ann 's Lane . She followed Needle-Work and Quilting , and during the Time I have known her , I never missed her Conversation , till about half Year ago . Her Husband is Clerk to one Mr. Jordan , who fits Men out for the Sea : he is a very honest Man , and I never heard any harm of her . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 195 . + John Singleton , of St Giles in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing a gold Watch , and gold Seal , value 15 l. from the Person of Henry Lampton , Esq ; April 4 . Mr. Lampton . On Friday the 4th of April , about 7 o'Clock , as I was coming out of the Sardinian Ambassador 's Chapel in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields , the Prisoner ran against me , and I found immediately my Watch was gone out of my Fob . Upon that I seiz 'd him ; and a Person who was standing in the Croud , on the other side of the Way , brought me my Watch , and told me he saw the Prisoner sling it out of his Hand . Prisoner . Ask him , if he did not clap hold of both my Hands at that Time ? Mr. Lampton . No ; I did not . I seized him by the Collar . Prisoner . All the People who were going by , said I was accused wrongfully . John Barret . On Friday the 4th of April , I was coming by the Popish-Chapel , between 7 and 8 o'Clock , and saw Mr. Lampton lay hol d of the Prisoner by the Collar . I stood to see what was the Matter ; the Gentleman held him with one Hand , and while he was stooping , ( as if it was ) to feel in his Fob with the other , I saw the Prisoner with his Right-hand throw a Watch over the Gentleman 's left shoulder . Then he said , I have it not , - I did not pick your Pocket ! - The Case opened , and the Watch flew in two Pieces ; and I ran to take it up , but this Man , ( Hadley ) took it up before I got to it . Mr. Lampton . While I had him by the Collar , I stooped to feel for my Watch with the other Hand , and found it was gone . Prisoner . Was there not a Woman going by , who said I was wrongfully accused ? Mr. Lampton . Yes , there was a Woman in the Croud who said so , and I believe I saw the same * Woman in the Bar just now . * Margaret Newel had just before been in the Bar , to be arraigned , See her Trial below . John Hadley . I am Servant to Mrs. Collier in Green 's Building , and at that Time I was standing opposite the Mass-House Door , and saw a Watch flung by me , but whence it came I knew not . It fell by me , in separate Parts ; I took it off the Ground and held it up ; and Mr. Lampton having seized the Prisoner by the Collar , at the same Time , I asked him , if it was his Watch ? He owned it ; I am sure I delivered him the same Watch I saw thrown ; and that there was one Seal to it . Mr. Lampton . The Watch and Seal which this Witness delivered to me was my own . Prisoner . Put him , ( Hadley ) to his Oath , whether Barret was not talking with him at the same Time ? Hadley . No ; I was not . Prisoner . 'T is very odd , that I should throw such a Thing away if I had had it . The Jury found him Guilty , Death . 196. Phillis Pidgeon , of St Sepulchre 's , was indicted , for that Anthony Underwood of St Andrew 's Holborn , having stolen 1 Pair of worsted Stockings , val . 2 s. the Goods of Richard Manning , Dec. 20 , 1736 . She the same did receive , knowing them to be stole . December 20 . 1735 . The Record of Underwood 's Conviction was read . Mr. Manning . In December 1736 , I was robbed by Underwood of 2 Pair of Stockings ; they were stolen out of my shop in Holborn . By Underwood 's Directions I went to the Prisoner 's House : She then lived in Black-Boy-Alley in Chick-Lane . I took her before Mr. Justice Poulson , about a Day or 2 after the Robbery was committed , and one Pair of my Stockings were taken off her Legs : but soon after this , she was admitted to Bail , and I never could find either the Prisoner or her Bail , until some little Time ago when her Bail came and told me she was in Custody , and that I must prosecute her . Prisoner . I gave Underwood 3 s. and 6 d. for the Stockings , and asked him if he had not found them , and said I would not buy them if he had stole them . Manning . Underwood was a Boy , about 14 Years of Age ; I prosecuted him in January Sessions 1736 , for stealing 2 Pair of Stockings . One Pair , which I took upon Him , and those which I found upon Her , were mine . She now says , she gave 3 s. and 6 d. for them ; but when she was before the Justice , she said she gave but 1 s. and 6 d. and did not ask the Boy how he came by them . The Stockings cost me 4 Shillings . John Cook , I was Constable at that Time , and took her up with a Warrant , on Account of these Stockings . They were taken off her Legs before the Justice ; Mr. Manning swore to them , and she owned she had bought them of Underwood . I do not remember what she said she gave for them . Acquitted . 197 . + Margaret Newel , of St Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing a Gold Watch , and a Gold Chain and Seal , val . 15 l. from the Person of the Chevalier Charles Rusca , March 9 . The Prosecutor being a Foreigner , a Gentleman was sworn his Interpreter . The Chevalier Charles Rusca . On the ninth of March last , as I was going into the Sardinian Ambassador 's Chapel , the Prisoner plucked my Watch out of my Pocket . I seized hold of her Hand , and cry 'd , Where 's my Watch ! Upon this , she threw up both her Hands , and opened her Breast , and said , she had it not , she had none of the Watch . The Reason of my mistrusting she had got it , was not from my feeling her take it , but from seeing the Motion of her Hand ; and this made me imagine my Watch was gone , though I did not see it in her Hand . When I taxed the Prisoner with having taken it , she deny 'd it ; but a person informing me she had dropped it behind her , I looked for it , and found it on the Ground , just behind where the Prisoner had been standing . When I had got my Watch again , I troubled myself no more about the Prisoner , but went into the Chapel . Prisoner . Did not you take hold of another Woman at the same Time ? Chevalier Rusca . After I had seen that she had nothing in her Hand , I did lay hold of another Woman . James Smith . This Thing was done on Sunday the ninth of March ; I was going into the Chapel at the same Time , and was within a Yard and a half of the Gentleman when it happened . I saw him catch hold of the Prisoner 's Hand , and he cry 'd out , Ma Montre ! Ma Montre ! A Gentlewoman coming up , asked what was the Matter ? I told her the Gentleman cry 'd , Ma Mon-tre ! Ma Montre ! Why ( says she ) that is , His Watch ! His Watch ! Upon which I caught hold of the Prisoner on one Side , while the Gentleman held her on the other , and while I called out , - The Gentleman has lost his Watch ! she shifted her Hand behind her , and dropped it upon the Ground , just within the Chapel . I am positive she is the Woman , and that I saw the Watch drop behind her , but by the crouding of the People she was pushed a little beyond it , and then we saw it . When we took it up , we saw a little Tin Box on the Ground , in which was three Shillings ; the Prisoner cry 'd , - that Box is mine ; but I did not see her drop that , though I saw her drop the Watch . Prisoner . Did not I lift up my Hands directly , to shew I had none of the Watch ? Smith . As soon as ever she had dropped the Watch , she lifted up her Hands , and then cry 'd out , - Search me ! Search me ! I am sure she dropped it before she lifted up her Hands , for I saw the bottom Part of the Watch , and the Chain , slipping through her Hand . This is the same Watch , I am almost sure of it . Prisoner . Ask the Chevalier whether the Watch had a Chain to it at that Time ? Chevalier Rusca . It had the same Chain to it then . The Watch was in the same Condition as it is in now . Smith . I saw the Thing from beginning to ending . When the Gentleman had got his Watch again , he went into the Chapel ; but the Mob saying he had given Orders to his Footman to have the Woman secured , we took her , and carried her to a publick House , the Sign of the John of Gaunt , and from thence to a publick House in Holhourn , where we kept her till we got more Constables . Prisoner . Ask him if the Gentleman did not seize another Woman ? Smith . Not just then ; - it was afterwards . The Gentleman had hold of the Breast of her Gown , when she threw up her Hands ; and I informed him she had dropped the Watch , in half a Quarter of a Minute , - I told him of it as soon as I could , for there was a Croud of People in the Chapel , and then he laid hold of another Woman . I was giving him Notice that the Prisoner had dropped it behind her , while she was holding up her Hands , and just after he had picked it up , he took hold of another Woman , and pushed her and the Prisoner about , as much as to say , - Get out of the Chapel , The second Woman that he lay 'd hold of , was one who came up to him after the Watch was found ; and desired him not to hurt the Girl ( meaning the Prisoner ) now he had got it again , I ca n't say what he took hold of the second Woman for , because I could not understand what he said . Prisoner . I know nothing of the Watch , nor of that Woman ; but the Gentleman held my Hands till the Watch was found ; and then he bid us both go about our Business . Besides , - I had then a long scarlet Cloak on , and how could he see me drop the Watch ? Chevalier Rusca . She had then the same Cloak , which she has on now . ( She had a light-coloured short Cloth cloak on at the Bar . ) Smith . I think she had a red short Cloak on , at that Time ; and had a Velvet Hood , and a Hat over it . Chevalier Rusca . I am sure it was the same she has on now . Smith . To the best of my Remembrance , she was then in a red Cloak . Chevalier . I do n't remember how her Head was dress 'd ; but she had a Cloak of the very same Colour with that she has on now . Smith . When the Gentleman had got his Watch again , he went into the Chapel , and staid till the Ceremony was over ; after which a Man told him the Woman was in Custody , and he must go to Colonel De Veil 's . He went accordingly , but did not see the Prisoner ; for she was rescued from the Constables , as they were carrying her thither . Jury . We desire Smith may be asked what Trade he is , and what brought him to that Place ? Smith . I am 'Prentice to Mr Richards , a Tin-Man , at the Black Horse and Star in Fleet-street , near Fleet-Ditch ; and am of the same Perswasion , - a Roman Catbolick . A Gentleman upon the Bench deposed , that the Chevalier was with him , waiting for the Prisoner , in order to have this Affair examined into , but that after they had waited some Time , three Constables and a Beadle came and inform 'd them , that the Prisoner had been rescued out of their Custody . He added , that he knew her to be a most notorious Pickpocket , and that both she and her Husband had been several Times committed for Felony , which they afterwards had compounded . Prisoner . No , - not for Felony , it was for keeping a disorderly House . Gilbert Ward , Constable . My Beadle being charged with the Prisoner for robbing the Chevalier Rusca , on Sunday , March 9 , he brought her to my House . She then had a red short Cloak on ; but it is possible she might have changed her Cloak , between the Chapel and my House . She was brought to me between 12 and 1 at Noon , and we kept her two Hours , because the Gentleman did not care to give himself the Trouble to appear against her , and I did not know how to discharge her . At last I found him out , and desired him to go to the Justice 's , and told him , I would bring the Prisoner to him there : but as we were carrying her along , three Fellows with Fire-Arms stopped the Coach , over-against Windsor-Court in Drury-Lane , broke the Door open , and rescued her from us . Thomas Gilbert . We took Coach at Mr Ward 's Door , and were going before the Justice , with the Prisoner , but when we came against Windsor-Court , one Man came up , and clapp 'd a Pistol in at the Coach-Door , and swore he would blow our Brains out . Another bid the Coachman stop : I bid him drive on ; but he refused , and said he would not venture his Life . Upon this our Beadle jumped out of the Coach , but another Fellow ran up to him with a great Sniggersnee Thing , and swore he was a dead Man , if he stirred farther . Upon this the Prisoner jumped out of the Coach , and they all ran away together . The Chevalier 's Footman gave the Beadle charge of the Prisoner , on the Outside of the Chapel . Eleanor Byant . I am a Mantua-maker , and Habit-maker . I have worked three Years for the Prisoner , and between 7 and 8 for her Mother . I know they are honest People ; what I have done for them , they have paid me for . Her Mother liv 'd at St. James 's , and the Prisoner liv 'd first in the Hay-market , and now in Windsor-Court , in Drury-Lane . The old Woman was a green Grocer , and as to the Prisoner 's Business , I had no Occasion to enquire about that , - for if she employed me , she paid me . She kept a House , but I do n't know what Sort of a House it was , nor do I know her Husband . Eleanor Puzzle . I know the Prisoner kept House in Drury-Lane ; I ca n't say what Sort of a House , - it might be a House of Lodgers for any Thing I know : I never was in the Inside of it . I never knew any Harm of her in my Life . - I have known her about half a Year , - I have spoke to her , but never in the Way of dealing with her , for I never had any Dealings with her , but I can say she is an honest Woman , - as far as I know ; and I never heard otherwise of her . Jury . We desire to know what Business this Witness follows ? Puzzle . I am a Shoemaker 's Wife . A Gentleman . This Witness is a common Bawdy-house Keeper she has been committed herself : she kept a Bawdy-house in Jackson 's Alley , but I believe she is broke now . Guilty , Death . 198. Elizabeth Glass , of Paddington , was indicted for stealing 6 Yards and a half of scollop 'd Lace , val . 15 s. a Pair of Silver Buttons , val . 1 s. and half a Yard of Holland , val . 2 s. the Goods of Joseph Baker , March 20 . Acquitted . 199. John Bennit , of St Mary le Bone , was indicted for stealing a dimitty Waistcoat , value 6 s. the Goods of Thomas Hoskins , April 4 . Guilty , 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 200 . + Rachael Poole , of St Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing 4 Silver Spoons , val . 30 s. 5 Silver Tea-spoons , val . 12 s. 8 gold Rings , val . 5 l. a gold Necklace and gold Locket , val . 30 s. a Pair of Silver Knee-buckles , val . 3 s. and a Silver Seal , value 2 s. the Goods of Paul Dekayne , in his Dwelling-house , March 9 . Paul Dekayne . The prisoner is the Person : she took all these Things out of my Drawer . Here is the gold Necklace and Locket : here is 8 gold Rings , 5 Silver Tea-spoons , 2 large Spoons , a pair of Silver Knee-buckles , and a Silver Seal , - they are all my Property , and were taken out of a Drawer in my Bureau , which stood in the Parlour . They were taken from thence , ( as she says ) last Saturday was a Fortnight . The Prisoner lodged in a ready furnished Room in my House , but these things were not for the Use of my Lodgers : they were all put up in my Bureau , on Saturday Night , but the Drawer was not locked ; and I missed them on Monday Morning following , - it was the Monday after Palm Sunday . I immediately advertised them ; and a Pawnbroker having seen the Advertisement , came to me with the Gold Necklace , and asked me if it was mine ? I told him , I could swear to it , and enquired if he knew the Person who brought it to him ? He said he should , know the Woman again if he was to see her . I had a suspicion of the Prisoner , and let him have a fight of her ; and he told me , she was the Person who brought it to his House . Upon this I got a Constable , and told her , if she would confess , it should be better for her . She then told me the Things were all in her Room , and I got a Warrant to search it , but not finding any of them , she was committed to the Gatehouse . The next Morning she sent for me and my Wife , and took all the fault on herself ; and her pretended Husband restored these Things . A Witness . I believe the whole Discovery was made on a Promise of Pardon . There was an absolute Promise given the Prisoner , when they were before me , that they would be very favourable . P. Dekayne . I made her a Promise , in Order to get my Goods again , but I did not give her hopes of Pardon , that was not in my Power ; I only promised to be favourable , so as the Law would run . Mrs. Dekayne . The Prisoner was a Lodger in my House , in Great Earl Street , St. Giles 's . We lost these Things on the Saturday Night before Palm Sunday , when no body was at Home but she , and our Apprentice . We missed the Goods on Monday Morning , and by the Prisoner 's advice , she and I went to a Cunning Man , on the other Side of the Water ; and she prayed to God that the Person who robbed me might be brought to Justice , and as I was so good a Woman , she should be glad ( she said ) to see them hanged who had injured me . After this she went with me to several Pawnbrokers , and told me she would go 100 Miles barefoot , to see the Thief prosecuted . But as we could get no Intelligence of our Goods , my Husband advertised them ; and the Wednesday following the Pawnbroker came with the Gold Necklace and Locket ; and the Prisoner coming into the House at the same Time , he knew her , and said he would swear she was the Person that brought it to him . Upon this she was seized and carryed before his Honourable Worship , where she confessed every Thing ; and as she came out of his Worship 's House , she said she would not part with the Things , - she would keep them to maintain her , while she was in Goal . While she was in the Round-house she sent for us , and when we came there , she desired me to go up Stairs with her : I did so , and she told me it was out of her Power to help me to my Things again , and she fell down on her Knees , and owned she had taken them all . Dear Mrs Poole , said I , how did you get in ? At the Door , or the Window ? Mrs Dekayne , ( said she ) your eldest Apprentice went out into the Yard , and desired me to take Care of the Parlour Door , and while he was gone out , I went in , in Hopes of finding a great deal of Money ; but finding none I looked about for something else ; and the first Things I found were the Rings , the Necklace and Spoons ; and Mrs Dekayne , ( says she ) if I had not been afraid of your Apprentice 's returning , I should have looked farther . She owned she had taken all the Things mentioned in the Indictment , and begged for Mercy . I told her she had shewn me none , but yet if she would tell me where the Goods were I would be favourable . So we got the things , and we carried them , with the Prisoner , before his Worship : and when she came there , she could make no Answer to them , but owned she had taken them . - There were no Promises given her of Favour . The Justice . The Goods , with the Prisoner , were brought before me ; she owned she had taken them , but insisted on the Promises they had made to her , and they did not at all contradict her , nor deny their Promise . - Jenkins . The Prisoner had formerly brought several Things to our Shop ; and she came with this Necklace on the first of April . I took it in Pawn from her , but it being advertised , I carried it to Mr Dekayne , and he owned it . The Prisoner in her Defence said , that Mrs Dekayne had complained to her that her Husband had carried away some Things of Value ; and that she committed this Necklace and Locket to her Care , after she had made her drink until she knew not what she did , or said . But she denied having any thing else in her Custody . Mrs Dekayne deposed she had not drank with the Prisoner , and that the Goods were all taken away together , while she and her Husband were abroad . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation .

[ Transportation . See summary . ] 203. Mary Perkins , of St Giles 's Cripplegate , was indicted for stealing a green Tabby Gown , val . 5 s. a linnen Sheet , val . 5 s. a white dimitty Waistcoat , value 9 s. and a scarlet cloth Cloak , val . 6 s. the Goods of Samuel Jackson , Octob . 5 . Samuel Jackson . I lost a Cloak , a Gown , a Waistcoat , and a Sheet and several other things , which we can not swear to , because she deny 'd them ; but the Goods I have mentioned , were lost the Friday after Michaelmas last . I suspected the Prisoner had taken them , and hearing she was gone to Barnet , I sent after her , but could not find her till last Saturday was three Weeks , and then I accidentally li't of her in Chiswell-street , and taxed her with the Things - I ca n't say I mentioned every particular Thing , - I did mention some of them , and asked her if she had not stole them ? She owned she had , and went with me to a Pawnbroker 's , at the Angel and Anchor , at the Bottom of Grub-street , and asked for the Waistcoat and Sheet , in the Name of Perkins , and when the Pawnbroker told her , he did not remember them to have been pawned in that Name , she said it might be in her maiden Name , Mary Harrison , but the Pawnbroker said , that was not the Name they were left in , so he would not produce them . Then the Prisoner carried me to another Pawnbroker 's , at the Sign of the Tea-table , and asked for the Gown in the Name of Mary Perkins , or Mary Harrison ; and the Gown being produced , I said it was mine , and desired the Pawnbroker to take care of it , till he heard farther from me . I afterwards went to this Man ( at the Sign of the Tea-table ) and asked him if he would let me have the Gown again without a Search-warrant ? He told me , I should not have it either with , or without , a Warrant ; upon which I got a Warrant , and searched the House , but , I suppose , he had made away with it , for I could not find it . The Prisoner at first said , she had only pawn 'd the Cloak for a Smilling , and that my Wife had lent it to her ; but she afterwards confess 'd all the Things , and went with me to the Pawnbrokers where she had pledg 'd them , - I ca n't say she told me how she came by them . Elizabeth Jackson . The Prisoner lodg 'd in our House , and lay with a Girl who is our Servant . The Things mentioned in the Indictment , were miss 'd the fifth of October last , and I suspected the Prisoner to have stole them , because she said she was going to receive some Money of a Gentleman at the Half-Moon-Tavern , and should return in half an Hour , but she never came home any more . I had Occasion to look for a Cap for my Child , in about an Hour after she was gone out , and miss 'd all the Things : nor could we hear any Thing of the Prisoner , till my Husband met her in Chiswell-street , and then she owned she had taken them , and I saw my Gown at the Pawnbroker 's , but he would not let us have it , though it was brought down upon the Prisoner 's asking for it . We likewise went with her to another Pawnbroker 's , where she said she had pawn 'd the Waistcoat and Sheet ; but the People told her she did not ask for them in the right Name , and therefore they would not produce them : so we saw nothing but the Gown , and that we ca n't get . The Cloak ( indeed ) she had worn all the Winter , and it is not worth a Farthing now . Prisoner . I had Occasion for a little Money , and so Mrs. Jackson lent me the Things to pledge . Mrs. Jackson . I did not lend them to her . I do n't know that ever she saw any of the Things , before she stole them , except the Cloak , and that I once lent her , when she was going to see a House in Spittle-fields , which she proposed to take , and keep a Cook 's Shop . Mary Smith . I have nothing to say but this , - I heard the Prisoner say , last Monday , that she had pawn 'd the Things , which she had of Mrs. Jackson . She did not explain herself any farther , nor did I hear say , that Mrs Jackson had lent them to her . She own 'd she had pawn 'd the Waistcoat and Sheet at the Angel and Anchor . Prisoner . You swear this ! I wish my Friends were here , and then I would have your Ears for it . - Mrs. Jackson lent me the Things , and this Woman ( Smith ) did not hear one Word that I said to her . Guilty . The Pawnbroker , who refused to deliver the Gown , was sent for ; and , in Defence of his Behaviour , said , that he had shewn the Prosecutor the Gown , and tho ' they did not find it with the search Warrant he did not prevent their finding it , for they searched where they pleased . The Court reproved him , and order 'd him to restore it , which he promised to do directly . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 204 . + John Hetherington , of St. Luke 's Middlesex . was indicted for stealing a leather Bag , val . 1 d. a Pair of Silver Buttons val . 3 d. 2 Thirty-six Shilling-Pieces , a Moidore , 22 Guineas , 3 Half-Guineas , and 7 Shillings and 6 d. in Money , the Property of Richard Crimes , in the Dwelling-house of Edward Dudley , March 17 . Richard Crimes . I lost 30 l. out of a Chest in Edward Dudley 's House , It was in a Leather Pocket , in a Chest , which was locked , and I kept the Key of it : I took particular Notice , that it was there the 10th of Feb. last . On the 19th of March I was at Work at Stratford , and Mr Dudley came thither to me , and asked me what Money I had in my Chest at his House , telling me he found it broke open . I informed him , I had 30 l. there , and mentioned what Pieces of Money there were . 22 Guineas , 3 Half Guineas , 2 Thirty-six Shilling Pieces , one Moidore , and 7 s. and 6 d. in Silver . Upon receiving this News from Mr Dudley , I came directly to London , and found my Chest broke open , and all my Money gone . Mr Dudley suspected the Prisoner , because he was his Apprentice , and was run away . - I do n't know the Prisoner 's Age . Prisoner . I am between 14 and 15 . Crimes . The Prisoner being run away from his Master 's House , somebody informed him , that he had been seen with Money upon him ; this gave Mr Dudley a Suspicion of him , and he searched after him , took him , and got him committed to New-Prison before I came to Town . While he was there in Goal , I went to him , and examined what he had done with the Money . He told me , he forced open the Chest with a File , and took the Money ; and the Remainder , which was unspent , he had given his Master . He gave me an Account , that he went out with the Money into Moorfields , and got into Company with some Boys who were tossing up there ; that he carried some of the Boys to an Alehouse , where they had some Beef-stakes drest , and a young Woman with them . One of the large Pieces of Money , ( he said , ) he had given to a great Boy to get changed for him , and the Boy brought him 21 Shillings for it ; and 20 Shillings or upwards , he had spent himself . I asked him how he had made away with so much Money ? He told me , he had bought Shoes , and Handkerchiefs for several of the Boys , and one Handkerchief , which he had bought for himself , his Master found upon him . In this Manner he said he had spent 20 Shillings . The rest of the Money , that was missing , the great Boy had cheated him of ; for he had given him the Bag to hold for him at the Alehouse , while he went out ; and when he returned , he told him he was sure he had opened it , because it was not tied up in the same Manner , as it was when he left it in his Hands : Upon which the great Boy denied it , and ran away immediately . The Prisoner was taken before he had squandered all the Money away ; and Mr Dudley returned me 24 l. and upwards . Edward Dudley . The Prisoner was my Apprentice , and having ran away from my Service , I happened to see him as I was going with a Friend into the City , and I laid hold of him . I had not any Suspicion of his having taken this Money then ; but my Friend , observing him to drop some upon the Ground , told me of it , and I searched him , and took 6 Pence and 6 Pence Halfpenny out of one Pocket , and 2 l. 17 s. 6 d. and a Handkerchif out of another of his Pockets . Upon this I went to get Advice how to secure the Money , and in the mean Time he got away . When I came Home I found Mr . Crimes 's Chest broke open ; and when the Prisoner was taken the second Time , he owned he broke it open with a File , and had taken away all the Money . Nineteen Guineas , a Moidore , a Half-Guinea , and a Pair of Buttons , he delivered me at that Time , which he owned was part of the Money he had taken out of the Chest . The Prisoner 's Father says he is 15 Years old this Month : He has been bound to me between 8 and 9 Months . John Lashley . I saw the Money taken from the Boy ; there were 19 Guineas , a Moidore , and Half a Guinea . I heard him own he broke open the Chest with a Piece of a File , and then took out the Money . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty , Death . 205. Mary North , of St Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for stealing a Silk Gown , val . 30 s. the Goods of William Crane , Dec. 26 . William Crane . I am a Cabinet-maker , in Shoreditch . The Prisoner was one that used to go achairing , and being a poor Woman , and destitute of a Lodging , as we had a spare-bed in our Garret , we let her lie there out of Charity . The Gown mentioned in the Indictment was my Wife 's , and it being missing , we taxed the Prisoner with having taken it and she confessed she stole it on the 26th of last December , and hid it under her Bed , - between the Bed and the Sacking , until the next Morning , and then she carried it away very early . I knew my Wife had such a Gown , and that it was in the House before the Prisoner took it . 'Iis a brocaded Gown ; and the Prisoner owned she carried it to pawn at Mr Coxon 's the Pawnbroker 's , and he stopped it . Mr Coxon . About 10 or 11 o'Clock in the Morning , December 26. the Prisoner came to my House , and offered a brocaded Gown to pawn : this is the same identical Gown . Upon looking at the Gown , and examinig her , I suspected she had not come fairly by it , and my Suspicion was increased , by her not giving such satisfactory Answers to my Questions , as I expected from an honest Person . She said at first , that the Gown belong 'd to a Mistress of her 's in Holbourn . I sent thither , but the Prisoner 's Mistress was not to be found . I then told her , I would stop it : she told me , she would go and fetch the right Owner of the Gown , and she went out , and returned again , with a big-belly 'd Woman , all whose Clothes upon her Back was not worth 20 s. nor were the Prisoner 's better . I told the Woman , she could never be the Owner of that Gown in question , and that I would stop it , and advertise it , which I accordingly did ; and the Prisoner came one Evening about 7 o'Clock , ( five or six Nights after the Gown had been advertised ) and she was then a little better dressed ; she asked for the Gown that I had advertised : I looked her full in the Face , - Why , says I , you are the Woman who brought it here ! Yes , says she , I am so , and what then ? Why then I will stop you ; but before I could get from behind my Counter she was gone . I pursued her , but being in my Slippers , and the Ground being slippery with the Snow , she out ran me , and got clear off . I heard nothing of the Owner of the Gown , till a Fortnight or three Weeks after ; and then the Prosecutor came and claimed the Gown . I did not shew it him , at that Time , but bid him go to Mr Oldfield 's , ( the Constable ) in Tavistock-Street , and if he made his Property in it appear , I should be glad to return it to him . After we had been at the Constable 's , we went before Col. De Veil , and there they described the Gown so particularly , that the Colonel said , it plainly appeared to be theirs , and 't was pity they had not taken the Thief . In about six Hours afterwards , they did take the Prisoner , and brought her before the Colonel , where she owned she had stole the Gown . She acknowledged the same at Mr Oldfield , the Constable 's House . I think this is the very Gown the Prisoner brought , and which I stopped : 't is worth 10 l. and I verily believe it is the same . Isabel Carr . When the Prisoner brought the Gown to pledge at Mr. Coxon 's , she said she liv 'd at the three Nuns , a Linnen-Draper 's , in Holbourn , and that the Gown was her Mistress 's , who lived there , and her Name was Jackson . I went to enquire for this Jackson at the three Nuns , but no such Person lived there . When the Prisoner was before Colonel De Veil , she owned she had stole it , and wished she had over looked it . - That was the Expression she then made use of . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 206 . + Mary Taper alias Huntley , of St Giles in the Fields , was indicted ( with James Dixon and John Parsons , not yet taken ) for assaulting Robert Fellows on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Cambrick-Stock , value 3 d. a Silver-Clasp , value 2 s. 6 d. and 5 s. in Money , March 4 . Robert Fellows . About the third of March last , - I ca n't tell exactly the Day , - the Prisoner stepped up to me , as I was going along the Street , over against St Giles 's Church , about half an Hour after eleven at Night ; she took me about the Neck , with one Hand before , and the other behind , and got away from me my Stock and a Clasp . I saw nothing of her till she came upon me , and being surprized , I turned short upon her , and then two Men came up to me , and struck me on the Breast , and knocked me down . I do n't know who the Men were , but one of them struck me down with a Blow he gave me on the Breast . When I was on the Ground , they turned out one of my Pockets , and took my Money , - 5 s. I am sure I lost , I believe I had more . The Prisoner , I am positive , is the Woman that came up to me first , for I had seen her at a House where I had been drinking that Night , and she would have come into my Company , had I not refused her . Prisoner . Ask him , if he was not disguised in Liquor ; and whether I did not make him leave his Watch , at the House where he treated me with two half Pints of Wine ? Fellows . The Man of the House told me , he would have me leave my Watch with him when I went away , because there was a Woman in the House who was just come out of Newgate * , but she did not say any thing to me about it . I had been drinking a Pint or two of Beer , but I was not ( concerned ) in Liquor . When the Man knocked me down , they searched me , and one of them swore , I had not got my Watch about me . * See last February Sessions , the Trial of Alice Cook alias Taper , No . 140 , P. 79 . Prisoner . Ask him , whether he and I were not at a Place together , where we had four Quarterns to Girl and whether he did not give the Clasp into my Hand , and say , - as I was a good honest Girl , he would give it me , for perswading him to leave his Watch behind him ? Fellows . No ; I never drank with her in my Life . Prisoner . He had but 6 d. about him , and that he spent with me ; ask him , if he did not desire me to lead him home , because I would not stay with him all Night , and whether he did not say before Colonel De Veil , that he neither knew where the Robbery was committed , nor whether the Clasp was taken off his Neck , or out of his Pocket ? Fellows . It was taken off my Neck ; and I said the same before Colonel De Veil , that I have said now . Susan Brown . I was coming past St Giles 's Church the third or fourth of March , between 11 and 12 o'Clock , and saw the Prisoner 's Hand about the Prosecutor 's Neck : I had seen him before , and was acquainted with the Prisoner , and the other two Men . After she had taken her Hands from his Neck , Jack Parsons and James Dixon came up , and knocked him down in the Dirt . I saw this , but I was afraid to speak then for fear of having my Brains knocked out . But the Prosecutor coming next Day to the House , where he had left his Watch , I told him what I knew , and went with him before Colonel De Veil , where I gave the same Account I have given now . Prisoner . Ask her , whether I did not see her , next Day , in the Constable 's House ; whether I did not ask the Prosecutor there , if he knew who robbed him ; whether the Prosecutor did not say , No ; and whether she did not point to me , and tell him , I was the Person ? She has a Spite against me , because I once served a Warrant upon her . Brown . She never served a Warrant upon me in her Life : Mr Fellows said he knew her , the Minute he saw her , and said she was the Woman . I only told him then , that I had seen her use him ill . I saw the Prosecutor in the House , that Night he was robbed ; he had been drinking , but was not in Liquor , - he was not drunk . Ann Baker . On the 4th or 5th of March , I met the Prisoner , and gave her a Pint of Beer : and Nanny ( says she , ) I am going to sell these Clasps , which I got the Night before , and a little Money with it . She told me she had picked a Man 's Pocket , the Night before , so I went with her to sell the Clasps , in Drury-Lane . She said at first , that she had picked a Man 's Pocket , and afterwards she said , she got the Clasps off , with the Stock . Prisoner . As he had given me the Clasps on Saturday Night , and had fetched his Watch on Sunday from the House where he left it , I thought I should never see him again , so I got this young Woman to go with me to seil them on Monday . Samuel Daley . The Prisoner and the last Witness brought me the Clasps , and sold them to me on Tuesday or Wednesday the beginning of March . These are the Clasps . Fellows . They are mine : they were taken from me at the Time I have mention 'd .

Mary Curtis . Last Easter-Monday , about 12 o'Clock at Noon , I was walking between Hampstead and London , and the Prisoner came up to me in a Field , joining to Fig-Lane , and ask 'd me for some Money . I told him , I had but a Shilling to pa y my Coach-hire , and I pulled out a Shilling , and a Halfpenny at the same Time , which I gave him , and then he went off . He had something in his Hand , which surprized me , ( being alone ) tho ' I ca n't tell what it was : he presented nothing to me . I was 'frighted because I was alone , and had a Guinea about me , and more Shillings : but he did not threaten me with any Words , nor did he lay Hands on me ; and there were People passing along in every Fields , but this . - I ca n't say the Prisoner is the Person ; but a Man saw him with me , and pursued him , and took him . The Man who saw him with me , came up to me , after he had got the Shilling , and asked me if he had not robbed me ? I said , - nothing but a Shilling which I had given him . He had something in his Pocket , but I ca n't tell what it was , for I was in a Surprize , and alone . I was not in Fear of his proceeding to use Violence , because there were People in all the Fields . - He offered no Violence to me . I was afraid because I was alone , and I saw Part of something in his Hand , but I could not tell what it was , being alone . William Staples . This young Woman and my Master were walking together from Hampstead , and just before they came to this Field they parted , and she went down the Field . I was upon the Shafts of my Cart , driving towards London , and saw a Man run up to the young Woman in the Field : she drew back , and he followed her : and I saw her put her Hand into her Pocket , and give him something . Then I jump 'd off the Copses of the Cart , and made up to her . When I was come within 20 Yards of her , I asked her if the Man had not robb 'd her ? She said , yes : upon which I desired her not to be frighted , but to make over to the Houses , and I would bring the Man back to her . I pursu 'd the Prisoner , and he took to his Heels , and ran up the the Field , into the Road that goes to St Giles 's , and from thence into another Field , and as he was getting over a Bank , I saw another Man , and called out to him to stop the Prisoner . The Man caught hold of him , and collared him immediately : He struggled to get away , but I got up to his Assistance in a Minute , and told the Prisoner , he must go back to the young Woman , for I did not know what he had taken from her . The Prisoner is the Man ; he is altered in his Dress now , but I remember his Face particularly well . Q. to Curtis . Did not you apprehend you was robbed at that Time ? Curtis . I did give him a Shilling , and desired him not to follow me . - I gave it to him . Staples . He had no Pistol about him when we took him , but he had a Tinderbox made in the Shape of a Pistol , and a Gardener 's Knife naked in his Pocket : and when we took him , we carry 'd him to a publick House , where the young Woman swoon 'd away several Times at the Sight of him . - We had much ado to bring her to herself . Curtis . I was more surprized when he was taken , than I was before . Jury . What did the young Woman say concerning the Prisoner , when she recovered out of her Fits ? Staples . She told us the Prisoner came up to her , and asked her for some Money : that she put her Hand into her Pocket , and dropped a Halfpenny ; and that she afterwards pulled out a Shilling , and gave it him ; and that he told her , if she would not give him the Money , he must take it . Curtis . Yes , my Lord , he did say so . Jury . How came you not to say so at first ? Curtis . I have not been apply 'd to ; - I should be sorry to take a Man 's Life away . Jury . Was the Prisoner in Liquor at that Time ? ( To Staples . ) Staples . No : he told us he had neither eat nor drank that Day ; till we took him to the Publick-house , and there he drank Part of two Pots of Beer . When the Constable came , he asked him if he had the Money about him ? He said no , he had flung it away ; but when he was before the Justice he was searched , and a Shilling and a Halfpenny were found upon him , and 18 Pence which was given him at the Adam and Eve Alehouse . John Wilden . I happened to be in the Field where the Prisoner cross 'd the Bank : after he had got over , he hid himself under some Brambles ; I got up to him , and he said , - Pray let me go ! Yes , said I , when the Man comes that followed you , and I have known what you 've done . So I held him by the Collar till Staples came up , and then we carry 'd him to the Alehouse , where the young Woman was , and she told us , that was the Man , who had taken a Shilling and a Halfpenny from her , and as soon as ever she saw him , she fell into a Fit . He did not appear to be in Liquor , for he said he had neither eat nor drank that Day . John Crist . I am the Constable who took the Prisoner into Custody . Upon searching him I found this Pistol-Tinderbox , this Knife and this Wig in his Pocket . He had a Cap on , when he was taken . Prisoner . I had a Wife who lay-in , and was starving , and I begg 'd this Money out of Charity . It is not consistent with Reason , that I should attempt to rob her in the open Day , and while so many People were passing and repassing . If I had intended to have robb 'd her , I should have taken a properer Time and Place . Acquitted . 211. Mary Miles , of St. Mary le Strand , was indicted for stealing a Fan , val . 20 s. the Goods of William Mills , March 5 . William Mills . This Maid ( the Prisoner ) was a Servant of mine : she had lived with me six Weeks . The third of March , she lay out all Night , and we having lost a Fan , and finding she kept loose Company , I taxed her with having taken it , and she owned it , and that she had first pawned it for 18 d. and afterwards had sold it outright for 4 s. She told us , that the Key of the Drawers being left in them , she opened the Drawer , and took it away . I am a Coffin-Maker , at the Corner of Wych-street , Drury-Lane . This is the Fan : I found it at a Pawnbroker 's in Russel-Court , where she said she had pawned it . I know it to be mine . A Witness . I went with the Prisoner , to fetch the Fan out of Pawn , where she told us , she had first pawned it , and then sold it outright for 4 s. Prisoner . I have nothing to say against my Master . To be sure , he has spoke the Truth . I lent the Fan to a Creature I was acquainted with , who promised to bring it me again the next Day ; but she did not : and the Fan not being asked for , she perswaded me to sell it outright . When my Mistress taxed me with it , I told her I would speak the Truth , and she promised to do me no hurt ; I accordingly informed her where the Fan was , and said , I was afraid I could not get it again , because it was sold . I never had but one Half-Crown from my Master in my Life , and never wronged any one of a Pin's-point before . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 212. Ralph Rane , of St Mary le Savoy was indicted for stealing a Gun , val . 20 s. the Goods of our Sovereign Lord the King , March 6 . Robert Mitchell . This is the Gun : I found it in the Prisoner 's Lodgings , at the Crooked Billet , in Plumbtree-street , St Giles 's , with the King 's Arms , and G. R. all filed out . It belonged to Colonel Hougham 's Company in which we are Soldiers , and 't was lost last Monday was 3 Weeks . When the Prisoner was carried before Colonel De Veil , he owned he took it out of the Passage by the Savoy , where this Man ( the next Witness ) had left it , and carried it into a Stable belonging to Captain Howard . It was only reared up against the Wall , in the Passage , while the Man ( to whose Custody it was committed ) went into the Savoy to see a Friend , and when he came back the Gun was gone . The Prisoner did not pretend to say he thought it was lost , or that he found it , but said he took it out of the Passage , and was to have sold it to a Man in the Country for 15 s. but the Man would not have it , unless he would file all the Marks out of it . John Champion . This Firelock was committed to my Care , by the Officers of our Regiment : and wanting to speak with a Friend in the Savoy I left it in the Passage , and stepped in , for about a Quarter of an Hour . I reared it up against the Wall , when I went in , but when I came out , it was gone . I did not stay above half an Hour in all . This is the Firelock I lost ; the Marks are all filed out of it , but there is one in the Ramrod still , and I can swear it is the same . After we had given out Bills , and offered a Crown reward to any one , who would help me to it again , we found it in the Prisoner 's Lodgings , while he was abroad ; so I had no Discourse with him about it , nor heard him say any thing concerning it , until we came before Colonel De Veil , and there he said he had found it in the Passage by the Savoy . The Justice asked him why he filed the Marks out ? He told him he was to have sold it to a Man in the Country , and the Man would not buy it , unless the Marks were taken out . I reared it up in the Passage , while I went in , because no Soldier is allowed to carry Arms with him into the Savoy . Prisoner . When did you lose this Firelock ? Champion . The 6th of March last . Prisoner . It was after the 11th of March when I found it : and as I was going into the Country , I enquired among the Barracks if any of the Soldiers had lost a Firelock ; but I did not care to have it cried , for fear it should have been owned by somebody it did not belong to . As to the Marks , I know nothing of their being filed out . My Wife was ill , and I got a Woman to look after her ; and this Woman 's Husband ( who is a Soldier ) coming to my Room to see her , he looked at the Firelock , and went to these Men and told them where it was , and so he got the reward for discovering it .

On Saturday the 15th of March last , between 6 and 8 in the Evening , we lost some Linnen off the Lines in the Yard , and the Monday following , my Wife met the Prisoner in Saville-Street , ( in our Neighbourhood , ) with some Things upon her , which made her suspect she was the Person who had robbed us .

She owned she went into the Yard and took the Linnen , but she said , she was in Liquor , and knew not what she did : - When I first saw her in the Street , she was standing at a Gentleman 's Door to hear some Musick , and as I passed along , I observed she had got my lac 'd Mob upon her Head ; upon which I taxed her with having stole them , and knew all my other Linnen , which she then had upon her . She owned she had pawned the rest of the Things , and I would have brought the Pawnbroker here , but he is gone out of Town . Prisoner .

The Prisoner and I lay together in the same Bed : she complained of a Pain in her Limbs , and kept her Bed for three Days . I ca n't tell the Time exactly , when this happened , but one Night , I came home and went to Bed , after I had been out all Day hard at Work ; the Prisoner in the Night got upright upon her Knees in the Bed ; and I asked her , what she was doing ? She told me , she was making use of the Pot . In the Morning I got up to go to my Work , and because the Prisoner had been restless all Night , I innocently went to put the Clothes upon the Bed , to cover her ; and under her Gown I saw a Handkerchief ; and in the Handkerchief I found a Baby wrapped up . I asked her , why she did not call for Help , when I asked her what she was doing , but she made me no Answer at all . This was about 8 o'Clock in the Morn . ing . - I did not observe whether the Child had received any Hurt in its Body , nor can I tell whether it was at its full Growth . - I never heard it cry .

Elizabeth Holman . I am a Midwife and I was sent for about two Hours after the Woman was brought to Bed . I examined the Child , and found it at its full Growth , but it was dead when I saw it , and I ca n't take upon me to say , whether it was born alive or not . I did not observe any Hurt or Bruise upon it . This was in the Time of the hard Frost ; I ca n't tell what Day it was exactly . After I had seen the Child , I asked , how she came to kill it ? She said , she did not kill it ; she found it dead , and therefore laid it away from her ; and before she would have killed it , she would have gone a-begging with it . I desired her to tell me who was the Father ? She said , she could not tell who it was got it , nor where he was , for one of the Men was gone twenty Miles , another thirty , and another four Miles off . Elizabeth Pearce . The Prisoner lived a Year and a half in my House , and I never saw any Harm by her in my Life ; she always kept good Hours , but as to this Fact , - I did not know she was with Child , nor that she was brought to Bed , till Claxton , ( the first Witness ) came down Stairs in the Morning , and told me what had happened . I asked her , how she came to be so naughty ? - And she made me no Answer at all . The Prisoner had no Witnesses to call ; and , in her Defence , only said she did not murder it .

I am positive the Prisoner was concerned with me , in this Robbery ; and there was another young Man ( one Irish Jack , ) with us , at the same Time . Irish Jack , ( who was a big Fellow , ) took down one of the Glasses , and gave it me , to carry home ; and while I was carrying it home , Irish Jack and the Prisoner brought the other Glass after me .

I am a Tallow-chandler , and live in Golden-Lane , in the country of Middlesex . On the 2d of April , I was at Work in my Cellar 'till 9 o'Clock at Night , and then I went out to get me a little Supper , and while I was absent , the Excise-Man came to take an Account of the Candles ; and told me he missed 2 Sticks . We could not find out the Persons who took them , 'till about 10 o'Clock the same Night : and then the Prisoner 's at the Bar and Primrose Hudson ( the Evidence ) came again , and lurked about the Cellar-Window . I suspected them , and ran out of the Cellar , and caught the Prisoner . I charged him with having stole the Candles , but he denied it . The Evidence ran up a Court over against my Shop-Window ; but I went after him and took him too . He denied having any Knowledge of the Prisoner ; but the Prisoner afterwards confessed the Fact ; and acknowledged that he took the Candles , and sold them to one Stambridge in Porridge-Pot-Alley , for a Quartern of Gin and 4 Pence in Money . The Candles were in my Cellar after 9 , and I missed them before 10. Primrose Hudson . I know nothing of the Prisoner , but from my living in the same House with him . I was a-bed the Night the Candles were stole , but hearing a Noise , I got up ; and as I was going down Stairs , I saw the Prisoner bring in 2 Sticks of Candles . I heard him call for a Quartern of Gin , and he agreed to sell them to the Man of the House ( Stambridge ) for that Quartern and a Groat in Money . The Prisoner had the Gin , and Stambridge gave him a Halfpenny ; and he was to come the next Day for the rest of the Money . This was about a Month ago , I believe . - I live at Stambridge 's House , at the George , in Porridge-Pot-Alley , near Old-Street-Church . Stambridge fells Liquors , but I do n't know whether the Prisoner ever drank there before . He came in with the Candles about 9 o'Clock at Night , - or between 8 and 9 ; it was pretty late in the Evening I know , - but I ca n't tell the Day of the Month . Mr Gold 's House is in Golden-Lane not a Quarter of a Mile from Stambridge 's ; I should have known nothing of the Candles , had not I got up to see what was the Matter , when I heard the Noise in the Alley , and I intended to have gone out , if I had not seen the Prisoner come in with the Candles , and heard him call for a Quartern . He told Stambridge 's he had got some Candles ; and Stambridge 's Wife asked him where he got them . He said he got them out of Mr. Gold 's Cellar . I believe there might be 4 Dozen upon the 2 Sticks . Stambridge since this Fact is run away .

The Knife was flung at the deceased , with as much Violence , and Force as he was able to do it , - I do n't know whether it was flung in Sport , or no . The man died last Monday , and I have seen him since his Death ; but I am not a Judge whether the Wound was the Cause of his Death . Prisoner . Did not the Carver rase on the Stall-Board before it hit him ? Spratley . I am not sure of that . - I heard no Words pass between them . The Prisoner was sitting on his own Bench , and the deceased was sitting on the other side of the Shop , by the Door-Way . Susanna Whitcomb . I have Part of the same Shop , which the Prisoner occupied . I have one side of it , and he has the other . The Prisoner had a fine Tongue , which lay on the Stall-Board , and a Gentlewoman came by , and cheapened it . The Deceased told her it was bespoke : and the Prisoner said , - it was not sold . The Deceased told him it was already sold to a Customer , and was to be sent home , but the Prisoner still insisted that it was not sold . My Head was down at the same Time , and they changed about half a dozen Word , and then I immediately saw the Knife stick in the Side of the Deceased 's Belly . The Deceased took it out himself , and then fell down on the Ground , and I ran and called his Wife . The Knife was ly ing near the Prisoner , before it was thrown at the Deceased , but my Head being down at that Time , I did not see the Prisoner throw it . I happened just at that instant to be stooping down for something , and when I lifted up my Head , I saw the Carver sticking in Warner 's Belly . The Prisoner and the Deceased were about three Yards asunder , and the Knife was but just come home from the Grinder 's , and lay near the Prisoner . Anne Phillips . I was standing at the next Shop to the Prisoner 's , and saw him take up the Carver and throw it at the Deceased , and I went immediately to him , and saw it stick in his Left-Side . I ca n't tell whether any Words had passed between them , for I had but just turn 'd my Head that Way , when I saw the Carver fly . I heard no Words pass then , before it was flung , The Prisoner flung it at the Deceased with great Force , and I believe it did grate upon the Stall-Board before it struck the Deceased . The Prisoner was about 2 Yards from the Deceased , when the Carver was flung , and it stuck in his Belly , as he was standing at the Corner of the Door . Prisoner 's Q . What Part of the Knife hit upon the Stall-Board ? Phillips . I ca n't tell that ; but I saw it fly with a great Force , and saw it stick in his Belly : then I was frighted , and ran away , so I did not observe the Wound . Prisoner 's Q . Did not the Deceased and I use to drink together ? Phillips . Yes ; and I never heard them quarrel . Ann Leavers . I saw the Carver sticking in the Deceased's-Body , but I ca n't tell who flung it at him , nor did I hear any Words pass between them , before it was thrown : but I saw the Deceased pull the Knife out of his Belly , and both Blood and Fat came out at the Wound . Prisoner 's Q . Were not the Deceased and I Friends ? And had not we been drinking together ? Leavers . I ca n't tell whether they were Friends or no : nor whether they had been drinking together , before the Fact . Thomas Turner . I was in my own Shop , five Doors above the Prisoner 's ; so I did not see the Carver thrown , but hearing the People say , a Man was kill 'd , I ran to the Prisoner 's Shop , and saw the Deceased , stooping , - in a stooping Posture , with his Hand on his Side . I asked him , if he was hurt ? He said , yes , I believe I am . I opened his Breast , and saw a Wound just below his short Ribs ; the Blood ran out of the Wound into his Breeches , and a Lump of Fat , or Caul , appeared out of the Wound about the Bigness of an Egg . The Deceased looked like a very hearty Man ; I have drank with him several Times . I heard no Quarrel between them , for I was writing in my Shop , when this happened , and ran out , hearing the Noise . Prisoner 's Q . Were not I and the Deceased intimate together ? Turner . Yes ; and I have been often Times drinking with them both ; but I do n't know whether they had been drinking together that Day . I did not see the Stroke given ; but I undid his Clothes , and saw the Wound , and that the Caul came out , and then I came away directly . Ann Warner , the Deceased 's Widow . I was in my Room the Day this happened , and Murder was called three Times at my Window , and my Child came running up Stairs to me , and said - My Father is killed ! Who , Child , says I , would kill your Father ! But People still crying out , Murder ! I came down Stairs , and asked , who had killed my Husband ! Mrs Whitcomb said , - that Man there ( the Prisoner ) . Where is my Husband , I cry 'd ! They told me , he was gone to Mr. Biggs 's the Surgeon : and I ran away before him , to get Mr Biggs 's People to have the Door open against he came . These are my Husband 's Clothes ; here are two Coats , and a Flannel-Waistcoat ; this is the Shirt ; he had all them on that Time , and here are the Holes thro ' them all . Here is the Handkerchief , with which he wip 'd his Hands . They all appeared very bloody . Thomas Dimmock . The Day this happened , I was at the Feathers Alehouse , and the Deceased came in , and asked for six Penn'orth of Halfpence for his Mistress ( Mrs Clements ) . He told me , he had just done his Work , and would come and spend three Halfpence , and smoak a Pipe with me . Upon this he went out of the Alehouse with the Half-pence , and presently John Loop came in , and said - Warner was murder 'd . Upon hearing this , I ran out , and found the Deceased stooping on Mrs Whitcomb 's Stall-Board . I asked him , what was the Matter ! He cry 'd , - O Lord ! Lord ! I am murder 'd ! Who has murder 'd you , said I ! He answered , - Tom Clements . This was not above two Minutes after he went out of the House , with the Halfpence . Jury . Did your hear of any Quarrel having been between them ? Dimmock . No ; I heard of none . I have known them both for a considerable Time , and they and I have drank several Times together . The Deceased drank with me the Minute before he went out of Doors . Prisoner 's Q . Was there not a Friendship between us ? Dimmock . As for their Friendship , I know nothing of that . I never saw any Quarrels between them ; especially if the Prisoner was sober ; when he was drunk , he would be jarring with him . The Deceased was a meek Man at all Times , as far as I have seen ; but the Prisoner used to jarr with him , when he was in Liquor . - Mrs Whitcomb 's Shop , and the Prisoner 's , are both in one : She has one Side , and he has the other . When I saw the Deceased , ( after he was wounded ) he was leaning on Mrs Whitcomb 's Stall-Board , near the Door , and the Prisoner was fitting on the other Side of the Shop , about two Yards off from the Door . Thomas Boulter . I was sitting in the Feather 's Alehouse , and the Outery coming , that Clements had killed Warner . I ran out , and saw him leaning on his Belly , in Mrs Whitcomb 's Shop ; and I looked on his Body , and saw something like Fat , about the Bigness of an Egg , came out of the Wound . I served my Time with the Prisoner , and he was as good a Man , as any in the Neighbourhood : I ca n't think what the Devil perswaded him to do such a Thing . He was well enough when he was sober , but when he was drunk , he used to be troublesome . The Deceased and he often drank together in Friendship . I keep a Shop now next Door to the Prisoner . Elizabeth Allen . I saw nothing of the Accident . - What I have to say is something the Prisoner declared , after the Fact was done . When the Deceased was carried to Mr. Biggs 's ( the Surgeon 's ) the Prisoner came to me , as I was coming thro ' the Entry , and said , Damn you , - I would do it . This was after the Deceased was carry 'd to the Surgeon 's He came a - cross the Yard , into the back Entry , and said , - Here I am , and G - d d - mn you , I said , I would do it , and I have done it . On my Oath , I heard him say it : and I answered , you have done it , like what you are ; and I hope you 'll have to your Deserts . Jury . Did you call to the Prisoner before he Spoke to you ? Allen No ; he came into the Entry , and I said to him , - you have done for yourself , like a Rogue as you are . Prisoner . Ask her if she did not speak to me first , and tell me I had killed the Man ? Allen . No ; I did not : He came to me , in the Entry , and said , Here I am ; I am coming ; and G - d d - mn you , I said I would do it . He was coming thro ' the Yard , cross the Entry towards Clement's-Lane , at the same Time ; and one Hannah Jackson the Wife of Edward Jackson , a Barber , was at her own Door , cross the Lane , and heard the Words . I was at my own Door , and the Prisoner stood at the Post over against me . The Fact was done in our House , where we all live together . The Prisoner lives up two Pair of Stairs , and I live up one Pair . Prisoner 's Q . Was you examin 'd before the Coroner ? Allen . No , I was not . I was before Colonel De Veil , but I was not examined . Prisoner 's Q . Is Hannah Jackson here ? Allen . She lives at the Barber 's Pole , in Clement's-Lane , but she is not here . Mr Biggs , Surgeon . About eight Weeks ago , - I believe it was this Day eight Weeks , - I was coming to my Door , and saw about two or three hundred People in the Yard . I thought there might have been some Quarrel , and so I would have passed by , but some People in the Croud knew me , and would not let me . When I came in , I saw the Deceased sitting in a Chair , and my Man was stitching up the Wound in his Belly . The Teguments of the Belly were pierced through , and the Caul appeared . I saw my Man had stitched up the Wound properly , and as the Deceased was a poor Man , I advised them to carry him to St. Bartholomew 's Hospital , where there would be more Care taken of him , than any poor Man can have , in his own Habitation ; and it happened to be my Week to attend there . Accordingly he was carried thither ; and three Days afterwards , I found the Parts inflamed ; the Man was in Pain , and restless , and I was afraid of him . I then observed a great Quantity of Matter , which had pressed out between the Muscles , and the Skin , and that it was likely to be licked up in the Blood ; I therefore opened it about three Inches , and after this , the Wound healed kindly , and the Deceased made no Complaints . Where the Deceased was wounded , there was nothing farther to hurt but the Guts , and in this Case there was no Part wounded which was mortal : For if the Guts had been wounded , I should have found it out , by Cholick and Reachings . I did think at first , that some Gut might be prick 'd , and that a Mortification might ensue ; but afterwards I found , that for three or four Days he went to stool regularly , and complained of no Cholick , or Inclination to reach , and I was not afraid of his doing well ; for the Wound healed up , to the Compass of a silver Penny . The Wound that I had made , was not through the whole Integuments , but only between the Skin and the Muscles ; and after about a Fortnight , I apprehended the Man was out of Danger ; and I was teized to make an Affidavit to that Purpose , that the Prisoner might be bailed : But I deferred it for three Weeks ; and after about five Weeks I was under no Apprehension , that he would not do well ; for there was no Matter came from the Wound to wet the Lint ; and it was dressed lately with dry Lint . Then I made an Affidavit before Colonel De Veil , ( about three Weeks ago ) that I apprehended he was in no Danger from his Wound . But about four Days afterwards , I observed him to sink and waste ; tho ' he made no Complaints , and there was no Fever . When I asked him how he rested , he only complained of the Noise of the Persons in the Ward . When I first saw him , he appeared to me to have a bad Habit ; and when I went to the Market , I enquired , and found that both he and the Prisoner had been given to drinking ; and when a Person has been addicted to drinking , Things not fatal may turn so . Our Mens Wards are close , and confined , and we have been ( during the severe Season ) fuller of Patients than is convenient ; and I apprehended , that as Butchers live in the open Air , the Cause of his Alteration might be attributed to the close penning him up . At last the Wound grew slabby , as Wounds do when the native Heat is gone ; but it is a nice Point to determine whether the Wound was the Occasion of his Death . I take it not to have been the immediate Cause ; but consequentially , by confining him to his Bed , and by keeping him in one Posture . Q . Is it your Opinion that he would have been dead by this Time , if he had not received this Wound ? Mr Biggs . I ca n't say that . I was apprehensive , that as we were forced to expose the Body of the Deceased , he might get cold ; and I observed him to be low-spirited ; but they did not give that Notice to the Coroner , which they should have done , so it was impossible to make the Discoveries we otherwise should have done . I do believe the Wound contributed to his Death ; and I have seen Trifles of Wounds contribute to a Man 's Death : I have known a Pin in a Man 's Coat , to prick his knee , and the Consequence has been fatal to him . - In this Case , here was no neglect in the Hospital ; there 's more Care taken there , than any private Person can have taken of him elsewhere . To give the Deceased his due , he was as regular as any Man could be ; and consequentially the Wound was the Occassion of his Death . I saw him in a Quarter of an Hour after the Wound was given ; we do n't take a Wound in the common Integuments of the Belly to be mortal , nor if the Caul be wounded . Prisoner 's Q . As I understand you , you say the Wound originally given was not the Cause of his Death ; and did not you say , the Deceased was so far cur 'd of the original Wound , that there was not above the Breadth of a Silver Penny that penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly ? Mr Biggs . Yes ; - the Man seemed to me , to be of a sallow Complexion , and an ugly Constitution ; and I heard he had been a very hard Drinker . He was in our Hospital , from the first Day , to the Day of his Death : for in all accidental Cases , Patients are taken in , at any Hour of the Day . - As to the Decay of Strength in the Deceased , it might be occasioned by some Matter , which might be licked up with the Blood in it 's Circulation ; and the Wound , in Consequence , might be the Occasion of his Death . I saw a Man the other Day , who had a Cut upon his Cheek , and a hallow Wound was made ; the Matter was lick 'd up by the Blood , in it 's Circulation , and was thrown upon the Lungs , and he pin 'd away , and fell into a slow Fever . Prisoner 's Q . Then a Cut upon a Man 's Finger , may be consequentially the Occasion of his Death ; how deep was this Wound ? Mr. Biggs . It penetrated the Cavity of the Belly , and then whether it went 3 or 4 Inches , it was no Matter , provided it did not wound the Guts . When we cut , to reduce the Guts in Ruptures , we cut thro ' all the Cavities ; and if we take off Part of the Caul , we tye it up , and People do well . Had any principal Part , in the Deceased , been wounded , the Symptoms would have appeared at first : but he went on well , for 5 Weeks . The Wound was not throughly cur 'd , but it was cur 'd to the Bigness of a Silver Penny : and such a Wound if given to 20 Persons , of an healthy Constitution , 19 of them might be cur 'd , unless there were any concurrent Causes to the contrary . Prisoner 's Q . Had you ever any Conversation with the Deceased about this Accident ? Mr. Biggs . We only ask Questions of our Patients , which may relate to their Cure ; - we never ask them any other Questions . Prisoner 's Defence . The Deceased for several Years has cut up my Meat , and we commonly drank together , 3 or 4 Times o'Day . I never had any Malice against the Man , but supported him all that lay in my Power . Ann Stonebank . I knew both the Prisoner and the Deceased ; I have known them both many Years ; ever since I was a Child in the Market , I never heard of any Quarrels between them , but I was little acquainted with them otherwise . On the Twenty-second of February , when this Accident happened , as near as I can guess 't was that Day , Warner ( the Deceased ) came to my Shop , and asked me what Beef I would have cut ? Billy , says I , I ca n't tell ; and so he fell a talking to me about my little Boy . I said , Billy , you seem to have drank more than you have bled to Day . So I have , said he , for my Master Clements and I have had 2 or 3 Drams together ; but I will go and see what Beef he will have cut to Day , and then I will go home to Bed : and immediately after this , I heard of the Accident . When the Prisoner is sober , he is a very sober Man , but when he 's drunk , he is like a Mad-Man . Prisoner 's Q . What do you mean , by being like a Mad-Man ? Stonebank . That is , he hardly knows what he does . I never knew him but doing all the Good he could ; and he would treat every Body he come near , not knowing what he does , but as good natur 'd a Soul , as any Body could come near . Mary Huntsfield . I do n't know the Prisoner . I am the Nurse in the Ward where the Deceased died . He neither desired the Prisoner might die , nor did he ever forgive him : He said , he had been drinking the Day this Accident happened . Mrs Clements , ( the Prisoner 's Wife ) took a great deal of Care of the Deceased till he died , and let him want for nothing that he had a mind to . I never saw a Wound look fairer than the Deceased 's , till about two Days before he died . Mary Hammond . I have known the Prisoner many Years ; I likewise knew the Deceased . On the 22d of February , ( when this happened ) the Prisoner and the Deceased had been at Dinner together at the Feather 's Alehouse , and there appeared to be no Difference between them . The Prisoner was much in Liquor , and eat no Dinner at all . The Deceased cut a Piece of Mutton , and put it on a Piece of Bread , and went directly to the Prisoner 's Shop to eat it . No Words passed betwe en them ; and this was not an Hour before he was killed . The Prisoner is as peaceable as can be , when he 's sober , but when he 's in Liquor , - I ca n't say any thing so it . Prisoner 's Q . When I am in Liquor , do I do any mischievous Actions ? Hammond . He does Things out of the Way : nothing at all of this Kind . I ca n't recollect any thing in particular . Robert Thomlinson . I know Clements ( the Prisoner ) to be a very civil Man when he 's sober ; but when he 's drunk , he is like a Madman ; he knows not what he does , but behaves like a Madman . I ca n't say I ever saw him do any Mischief . - I was at the Hospital to see the Deceased ; but he did not say any thing how the Accident happened ; he said , God Almighty forgive him : I do ; for I would not have him hanged if I die . Elias Pritham . I know the Prisoner , but I know nothing of the Accident . The Day it happened , the Prisoner , the Deceased , and his Wife , dined together at the Feathers Alehouse , in Clare-Market , and they had three or four Pots of Beer together at Dinner , and I saw no Quarrel between them . The Deceased went from the Alehouse to the Prisoner 's Shop , once or twice , and came in again , and drank ; and after they had been at the Alehouse about an Hour , or three Quarters of an Hour , they paid the Reckoning , and went out together . I never heard them quarrel ; I took them to be Friends . When Clements is sober , he is a civil Man ; but when he is drunk , he is crazy : but I never knew him do any thing like this in my Life . Prisoner . Did not I always do every Thing to support Warner , and his Family ? Pritham . I believe he gave him something sometimes ; but not always . I have seen him give the Deceased a Joint of Meat at a Time . Henry Birt . I know both the Prisoner and the Deceased . The Deceased often worked for me , and behaved as an honest , civil , quiet Man . I heard of the Accident after it happened , and when he was in a fair Way of doing well , ( which was about three Weeks afterwards ) I went to see him , and asked him , if he could drink ? He said , he believed he could ; and I gave the Nurse Money to get him half a Pint of Wine : but I came away before he drank it . He then complained of the Noise of the People in the Ward . I never knew Clements do an ill Thing in my Life , and have heard Warner say , his Master was kind to him . Joseph Urby . I have known Clements these ten Years , and never heard a misbehaving Word from him in my Life . I used his Shop , and he treated me always civilly . I am a Victualler , and he has drunk at my House many Times , and always behaved peaceably and quietly . I have likewise drank with him several Times at other Houses about Clare-Market . I visited Warner in the Hospital , and was ordered by him to be one of the Prisoner 's Bail , because he liked me . I asked him , if he wanted Wine , or any thing else ? He said , Mrs Clements sent him Wine , and Eating , and whatever he desired , to the Hospital : and I have seen Wine there , which he said Mrs Clements had sent him . Robert Stonebank . I have known the Prisoner many Years ; and I knew Warner the Deceased . They were both well acquainted together , and very good Friends : I never knew of any Quarrel that was between them , They were always very friendly ; and if Warner asked Clements at any Time for a Pint of Beer , he used to give it him . The Prisoner was one of his Masters ; and the Deceased worked for me , as well as for Clements . Clements , the Prisoner , was a sober Man , - but when he was in Liquor , he was a quarrelsome Man : I ca n't say , ( of my own Knowledge ) that he ever did any Mischief . Matthew Hobbs . I knew both the Prisoner and the Deceased : I was a Tenant to the Prisoner , for 7 Years within a Fortnight or three Weeks . He behaved handsomely , as a Neighbour , - or any thing of that Kind . As to his Character , 't is that of an honest Man ; but when he gets in Liquor , he is apt to be passionate ; but I never knew him do a mischievous Thing in my Life , and I have been 15 Years in his Neighbourhood . I know nothing of the Accident . Richard Plimpton . I have known nothing of the Prisoner for these six or seven Years last past ; but about seven Years ago I lived in his Neighbourhood , and he then was not given to Drunkenness . Peircey Harding . I have known the Prisoner about twenty Years ; I have seen the Deceased , but I had no great Acquaintance with him . I live in White-Cross-Street , but I have been in Clare-Market three or four Days in a Week , and never knew but the Prisoner was a very quiet Man . He always behaved quietly and civilly to me , and to every one else , as far as I know . Sam Wasey . I have known the Prisoner eleven or twelve Years ; he was always civil , except he got in Liquor : and I never saw him do any mischievous Actions then . I know nothing of the Accident . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty , Death . 227. Ann Smith was indicted for stealing a Cambrick-Mob , value 20 s. the Goods of William Childs , March 1 . But the Prosecutor not appearing , the Prisoner was acquitted . 228 . + John Hyde , of Harmonsworth , was indicted for assaulting William Austin on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him , 7 s. in Money ; a Piece of Silver Coin , value 6 d. and a Piece of Copper Coin , value 1 Farthing , March 7 William Austin . I take the Prisoner to be the Man that robbed me - I believe he is the Man that was in Company with Moore * , who robbed my Master , ( Mr Freeman ) on Hounslow-Heath , in his Coach , as we were coming out of the Lane , from Colebrook , on the 7th of March . I am a Servant of Mr Freeman 's , and was on Horseback at the same Time , attending the Coach . It was after 4 o'Clock , or between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon ; and we were got about 3 or 4 Hundred Yards on the Heath , when Moore rode up to the Coach , and ordered the Coachman to stop ; and pulling a Pistol out of his Breast , he demanded my Master 's Money . Another Man at the same Time rode up to my right Shoulder , and said , let 's see what you have got . I asked him , what he wanted ? He clapped a Pistol to my Breast , and punched me with it on the Breast , then he clapped it to my Throat , and said , - D - mn you , your Money and Watch , or I 'll shoot you dead . Then he drew his Hanger , and gave me a Thrust with it on my Wrist ; the Mark is here now : and after this , he pulled out a crooked Gardener 's Knife , and cut my Horse 's Bridle , and took from me 7 Shillings in Silver , a copper Piece , and one old Shilling , - I think it was a Peice of Queen Elizabeth 's Coin . Moore , and the Man who robb 'd me , were both on Horseback ; and he who robb 'd me was not disguised , - he had nothing upon his Face , but I ca n't swear positively that the Prisoner is the Man , for I was in such a surprize , that I did not mind his Face , so much as I ought to have done : but I can swear to the Copper-Piece , which the Constable found upon the Prisoner , and took from him . Moore robbed my Master at the same Time , and did not molest me at all . He was about half the Length of the Court distant from the Man who attacked me , and I had some Knowledge of him , for I had seen him before . * See the following Trial . Prisoner . You say you are not positive that I am the Man ? Austin . No . - The Man who robbed me , took took off my Hat , and threw it on the other Side of the Way ; and some Men coming by , he ordered them to take it up , and give it to him . I told him my Hat would do him no Service , and desired him not to take it : upon which , Moore ordered him to return me my Hat . John Way . On the 7th of March last , as my Master was coming from Colebrook to London , we met 2 Men on Horse , - back in the Road , a little before we got on Hounslow Heath : and I observed them to look wishfully at the Coach , as they rode by it . They rode about an Hundred Yards , and farther on , in the Road , and I turn 'd back several Times to watch their Motions , and seeing them stop their Horses and turn about , I said to Austin , I fancy they are Highwaymen . They walk 'd their Horses 'till they came upon the Heath ; then they both gallop 'd up to us , and one Man rode up to the Coach , and the other stopp 'd Austin ; I ca n't swear to the Prisoner , because his Back was towards me ; but I saw the Man punch him first with the Pistol , and then he drew his Hanger and punch 'd him with that , and I saw Austin put his Hand in his Pocket , and give him something . I did not see his Bridle cut , 'till he came up to the Coach , and then he was forced to borrow another . I can not swear to the Prisoner 's Face . Zechariah Hobbs . I am a Constable : I know the Prisoner full well . I saw him and his Partner differ , - I ca n't say his Partner , - but I saw two Men quarrel , and the Prisoner was one of 'em The Prisoner was on Horseback , the other Man was on Foot , with his Horse 's Bridle on his Arm . This was on Friday the 7th of March , in a Lane between Harlington-Town , and my Lord Bolinbroke 's . The other Man said something to the Prisoner , - what it was I ca n't tell ; but the Prisoner wrapp 'd out a great Oath , and d - mn 'd his Soul , and said he would go no farther with him , as he had used him so ill ; and accordingly he clapp 'd Spurs to his Horse , and rode on : and the other Man cry 'd after him , - Go thy Ways Jack . The Prisoner , when he had left his Companion , rode off towards Harlington , and the other went towards Dawley . When the Prisoner came up to us , he asked to what Place that Road lead ? I told him to Uxbridge . He said , he wanted a good Inn , for he had met with a Man who had robbed and abused him . I said , I believed it was no such Thing . and that I imagined the Man who was with him , and he , were Consederates ; for I had heard the Words he spoke , and heard likewise a Pistol go off between them . Upon this the Prisoner pulled off his Wig , and shewed us his Head , which was broke , and said , - See how I have been beat and abused . The Blood ran down his Cheek , and he said he would follow the Man who had done him the Mischief . I told him , if he had been so served , it would be better for him not to go that Way , left he should meet with the Man again ; and then , says I , perhaps he 'll kill you . I bid him go to the Woolpack , near Dawley-Lodge , telling him , he there might have Entertainment for himself and his Horse . He went thither , ( and told a most deplorable Story , as I afterwards heard ; ) and I went about my Business , after I had directed him to the House . But about one o'Clock , in the Morning Night of the same Day , that is , in the Morning of the eighth of March , I was sent for to take charge of the Prisoner ; and accordingly I took him out of Bed at the Woolpack , about two o'Clock , and searched him . He had a Pistol , and a Hanger ; these Slugs * , and some Money I took from him ; among which I found that particular Piece , which Austin swears to . These Slugs he shot at another Man , that same Afternoon , and they dropp 'd into his Sleeve . This is the Pistol , and this the Piece of Money of Austin 's , and I have had the Custody of them ever since . * All the Slugs found on the Prisoner appeared to have been such Leads as Printers make use of in their Business . Austin . This Piece of Money is mine ; it was taken from me when I was robbed of my Money , on the seventh of March . Hobbs . I took it out of the Prisoner 's Pocket . Austin . After the Robbery was committed , Moore , and the Man who robbed me , rode off together . I saw no Quarrel between them then . They were upon sorrel Horses , and one of them had a Blaze down his Face . Hobbs . And when I directed the Prisoner to the Woolpack , he was on a bay Mare , with a Blaze down her Face . Austin . The Man who robbed me rode on a sorrel Horse , or a bright Bay ; I ca n't speak to any other Marks , nor can I tell whether it was a Mare or Gelding : and one of the Horses had a Blaze down his Face , but I ca n't tell which ; for I was very much surprized , and was afraid of being shot , or run through . Hobbs . This is the Hanger I took from the Prisoner . I took likewise an old Piece of Queen Elizabeth 's Money from him , but that I have lost ; and a Piece of sealing Wax , which I have not brought . Austin . Among the Money taken from me , was a Shilling above an hundred Years old , a very thin Piece ; and a Piece of sealing Wax , and a Key , the Property of my Master , was took from me at the same Time . Hobbs . These three Keys I found upon the Prisoner . Austin . The Key I lost is not among these . The Hanger with which I was wounded , was a strait one , with a sharp Point like this , but I ca n't swear to it ; I did not see the Handle . Hobbs . This Hanger was bloody to the Point , when I saw it . Here is the Prisoner 's Powder-horn , which I took from him . He threatened me , and two other Persons , who went with me to see him in Prison , that let him live or die , we and our Houses should all be rewarded . They heard him speak those Words , as well as I. James Woodcock . On the seventh of March , between five and six o'Clock in the Afternoon , I was going along the Road-side about my Business , and the Prisoner and another Man came down Colebrook-Road , on the farther Side of Hounslow-Heath . Just as they came over against me , one of them made a Stop ; I turned my self round , and before I had Time to speak , the Prisoner shot 3 Slugs into my Arm . Then he rode away , and his Hat flying off , he order 'd me to take it up and give it to him : I did not do it ; but a Woman , coming by , took it up and gave it him . I thought he was a Highwayman , but he did not rob me , and I gave him no Offence , so I do n't know what he shot me for . I did not know the Prisoner before , but I am sure he was the Man that shot me . These are the 3 Slugs , and this is the Coat I had then on . These are the Holes the Slugs made in my Coat-sleeve : They went thro ' my Coat , and wounded me , but did not lodge in my Flesh : I took them out of my Coat-sleeve . Josias Hollison . I keep the Woolpack , at Dawley Lodge , about a Mile , or a Mile and a Quarter from Hounslow Heath . The Prisoner came to my House the 7th of March about 6 in the Evening ; he was very bloody , and said he had been robb 'd of 5 l. and his Watch . His Head was broke in 2 Places , and the Blood ran down his Face , and upon his Coat . I never saw him before that Time , but I am sure he is the Man . After he had told me he had been robb 'd , he described a Man , and asked me if I had not seen such a Highwayman go by ? Mr Harvest was present , and told him , he had seen such a Man pass by , and he would go after him , and endeavour to take him , as soon as he had put up his Horse into the Stable . But I let Mr Harvest know I did not like the Prisoner , and that I fear 'd he had been robbing others himself , instead of having been robb 'd : So instead of following the other Man , he dress 'd the Prisoner 's Head , and rubbed it with something I gave him . After this the Prisoner drank a Pint or two of Wine , and then pulled out this Hanger , and this Pistol : these are the same ; I took particular Notice of the Pistol : the Stock and the Rammer are broken . I took them both , and laid them aside ; but when he went to Bed , he insisted on having the Hanger to lay by him , so I fetch 'd it , and laid it down by his Bedside : then I locked the Door , and kept the Key on the outside . Mr Harvest and Mr Timms being present , they were very uneasy about him ; they said he was a Smuggler , ( for he had offered to sell us Brandy and Rum , ) and having told us , before he went to Bed , that he had borrowed a great Coat of one John Reynolds , at Cranford-Bridge , we sent thither , and found he had borrowed a Coat there ; but Reynolds sent us Word , that if we had him , we must secure him , for he believed he had been that Afternoon out upon the Highway , and had done Murder . This confirming us in our Suspicion , we sent for a Constable about 12 o'Clock at Night , and secured him . It was one John Barton we sent to Reynolds to enquire concerning the Prisoner , but he has had the Misfortune to break his Collar-Bone , so he is not here . I have the Prisoner 's Mare in my Custody : she was in such a Sweat when she came in , that no one could tell well what Colour she was ; but she is a kind of a Sorrel : She had been rode so hard , that when she came into the Stable , she could hardly stand . This is the Prisoner 's Whip , and the Handle is broke . Austin . I ca n't swear to the Whip , nor to any thing but that Piece of Money . Hollison . The Hanger was bloody about half Way ; it looked as if he had cut somebody with it , and the Handle was bloody too , but that I imagine might be made so with his own Blood . Francis Harvest . On the seventh of March last , I was at the Woolpack at Dawley-Lodge ; the Prisoner came in almost fuddled , and his Horse was almost knocked up , he said , he had been wounded by a Highwayman , and had been robbed of 5 l. and a Watch . When his Horse was got into the Stable , I washed his Head ; it was bloody in two Places , and he told me , he had been fighting with a Man , who had drawn his Hanger , and had cut him ; I thought this was not true , because the Wounds in his Head did not appear to be Cuts , but rather to have been made by Blows with a Stick , and I imagined he had been robbing somebody himself : but wanting to draw something more out of him . I said to Hollison , - if you 'll call for a Pint of Wine , I 'll go and see if I can find the Highwayman . The Prisoner then said , - the Man who had robbed him had got two Pistols , and he knocked one of them out of his Hand , and if he ( himself ) had not been drunk , he should have killed him . I asked him , where he lived ? He told me , he lived at one Wagstaff 's , at the White Lion , at the Bank side , and he would make me amends for my Care of him ; and that he was a great Dealer in Brandies and Rum : and pray , says he , whose Mills are they upon the Heath ? I told him , they belonged to Mr Underhill . O , says he , I have a Bill for 50 l. upon him in my Pocket ; pulling out some Papers at the same Time . I thought it was strange he should not know the Name of the Owner of the Mills , and yet have a Bill for 50 l. upon him in his Pocket : so I asked him , who he knew thereabouts ? He mentioned John Reynolds , at Cranford-Bridge , so John Barton and I went thither to Reynolds , and having heard what he said , I went home to Brentford , and was not present when the Prisoner was secured and searched . Mr Timms . I was not present when the Money and these Things were taken from the Prisoner ; but I saw him that Evening in a narrow Lane , and his Head was in a very bloody Condition . He asked me , where there was a Publick-House , or an Inn , that he might be taken Care of ; for he had been abused , he said , by a Man on a sorrel Horse , and a light coloured Coat . There was a Man had passed by , some Time before , on a sorrel Horse , but that Man had a dark colour 'd Coat on , so I thought he could not be the Person . The Prisoner went to the Woolpack ; I put his Horse into the Stable , and Mr Harvest talked with him . At last we found him in several different Stories , and imagined he had been robbing somebody himself ; so after we had sent a Man to Reynolds , to enquire if he knew the Prisoner , a Constable was got , and he was taken into Custody : but I was not present at that Time . Prisoner . What Colour was my Horse ? Timms . 'T was a sorrel Mare . DEFENCE . Thomas Hart . I have known the Prisoner six or seven Years ; he is a Plummer by Trade , but I ca n't tell where he lives . The last Time I saw him was at his Lodgings at the White-Lion at the Bank-Side . He 's not a Housekeeper . He served his Time out lawfully with a Plummer , but how long he has been out of his Time I ca n't tell . During the Time I have known the Prisoner , I never heard any Harm of him . His Father lives at Reading , in Berkshire , and keeps a sort of a Publick-House , and a Farm besides , and bears a good Character in general . His Friends at Reading are in pretty good Circumstances , and capable of doing for him . They are honest People , and People of great Reputation . His Father was spoke to to come up to Town , on this Occasion ; but he has Business in the Country , and could not possibly attend . Jury . Pray what are you ? Hart . I am a Printer I live in Green Arbour-Court , in the Old-Baily , in the Parish of St Sepulchre 's . I was a House-keeper in Aldermanbury ; but Business not answering , I left it off and worked Journey-work again . ( He was ordered to look at the Slugs ) As to these Slugs , I never saw them before to my Knowledge : I did not furnish the Prisoner with them . - Marshall . The Prisoner 's Brother served his Time with me , duly and truly : and when the Prisoner was out of Business , he was welcome to my House for a Week together ; and he always behaved civilly . I am a Watchmaker , and 't was in his Power to have defrauded me of Things of Value : but he always behaved well , and when he came to lie with his Brother , he was welcome to his Victuals and Drink . I have known him three or four Years . John Marshall . I have known him between eight or nine Years . In that Time I never knew any Hurt of him , nor ever heard any till now . I have employed him as a Plummer , and found him deal faithfully and justly by me . He has been several Times in my Father 's House , and hath lodged there , and has been entrusted with Things of Value , but I never knew him do any thing tardy : and his general Character is a good one . My Father is a House-Carpenter . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . 229 . + John Moore , of Harmansworth , was indicted for assaulting John Freeman , Esq ; on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Guinea , and 6 s. in Money , Mar . 7 . John Way . On the seventh of March , as my Master ( Mr Freeman ) was coming to Town , two Men passed by the Coach on Horseback ; I looked after them , and seeing them turn their Horses , I told Austin they were Highwaymen ; and just as we got upon the Heath , the Prisoner rode up to the hind Wheel of the Coach , and cry 'd - Stop Coachman . Then he presented his Pistol into the Coach , and bid my Master deliver his Money . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man ; I remembered his Face as soon as ever I saw him in New-Prison . There were my Master and his Lady , and two Maid-Servants in the Coach ; and he swore he would shoot them , if they did not deliver their Money : Upon which I saw my Master hold out his Hand , and give him something , which the Prisoner put into his own Pocket . The first Money that was given him , he put into his Right-hand Pocket , and the next into his Left ; but I could not see what Money it was , and when he had got what he could , he bid the Coachman drive on . There was another Man in Company with him , but he did not come up to the Coach ; he stopped Austin . Prisoner . I am in such Misery I can not discourse . He said I was the Man ( in New-Prison ) before he well saw my Face ; and the Reason my Arm was so cut was , because my Name was Moore , and therefore they apprehended I was the Man . Way . When he robbed the Coach he had a brown dark-coloured Coat on , a Wig over his Hair , and his Hair was pulled down on each Side of his Face . He presented a short Pistol into the Coach , but I ca n't swear this is the Pistol , nor to what Money was given him , but I am sure he is the Man . Dorothy Biggs . As we were coming over Hounslow-Heath , on the seventh of March , between four and five in the Afternoon , the Prisoner came up to the Coach , and presenting a Pistol , he demanded my Master 's Money and Watch . I saw my Master give him Gold and Silver . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man . He had a dirty Wig upon his Hair , and his Hair was pulled over his Face . After he had my Master 's Money , he demanded mine , but my Master telling him I was only a Servant , he went off in a Hurry . Mr Freeman . As I was coming over Hounslow-Heath , the seventh of March , the Prisoner rode up to the Coach , and bid the Coachman stop . I am sure he is the Man : he swore bitterly , and demanded my Money and Watch . I gave him 10 or 12 Shillings , and a Guinea , - I ca n't tell how much exactly . After this he demanded the Servants Money ; I told him they were but Servants , and then he demanded my Wife 's Money , and she gave him 6 or 7 Shillings . When he had got what Money he could , he demanded my Watch , and felt for it himself . I told him , I had none about me ; and as he had got both Gold and Silver , he was pretty well off : Upon this he rode away ; I am sure he is the Man ; his Face is very remarkable , and I saw his black Hair under his Wig . Nathaniel Harris . I took the Prisoner on Sunday the ninth of March : I first went to his House , ( the Sign of the Jolly Sailor at Ratcliffe ) with a young Man ; but the Prisoner not being up , we waited till he came down , and then I bid the young Man go out to call the rest of our Assistants . While he was gone , I desired the Prisoner to drink with me , but he immediately went out , and we lost him . Upon this we went out to take a Turn , and returned again to the Prisoner 's House , which we searched , and found a Hanger , some Powder , and two or three Wigs . We had not been a Quarter of an Hour in the House ( this last Time ) before a Man came in , and asked if Mr Moore was at home ? I took him on one Side , and asked him if he knew Moore ? He said , yes . I told him I had a Warrant against him , and that he was a Highwayman , and if he would tell us where he was , it might be of Service both to him and the Publick . He told us he was then at a Publick-house , the Waterman's-Arms ; and hearing this I ran away thither , and forgot my Hanger ; but the young Man who was with me , happened to have taken the Hanger with him , which we found in the House . We found the Prisoner at the Waterman's-Arms , with a Pint of Beer before him , and I immediately laid my Hands on his Shoulder , and said , I take you up for the Highway . He clapp 'd his Hand in his Pocket , and I judged what he was going to do , so I called out to the young Man who was with me , - Cut away ! He did so , and we got the Prisoner out of the Box , where he sat , and cut him , and laid him upon his Back . Then he said , he would surrender ; and I took out of his Hand this Pistol ready cock 'd , and loaded with five Slugs ; and one of the Slugs was of the same Sort with those taken from Hide . ( See the preceeding Trial . ) This Pistol I took out of his Hand , and this I found in his Pocket . Prisoner . They chopp 'd my Hand off , before I saw them . Harris . We had Information that he had a Brace of Pistols about him : but we took him , and carried him back to his own House , and sent for a Surgeon , to sow up his Arm . We were forced to use Violence to him , because he was so desperate ; and upon searching him again at his own House , we found a Knife 15 Inches long upon him . Prisoner . He took my wearing Cloaths out of the House , and all my Money from me . Harris . I took 39 s. and 6 d. from him ; but I was wounded in the Contest , and have lost the Use of my Thumb . I could not work for a Fortnight , and have expended the Money , in paying my own Surgeon . My Thumb was almost cut off . - I have not the Money at present ; I am a poor Man , and have not the Money at present . - I ca n't give him any of his Money now , for I have not a Farthing about me ; and I have been out of Business a long Time . The Court reprimanded Harris for seizing and detaining the Prisoner 's Money , and ordered him to restore it . Guilty , Death . 230. John Cane , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing sundry wearing Apparel the Goods of Edward Wren , March 22 . Edward Wren . Last Saturday was 3 Weeks I lost all the things mentioned in the Indictment , ( be named them all ) from off the Horse in my Yard , and never met with them again . The Prisoner was seen in our Entry , after the things were gone , and was knock 'd down by a Watchman as he was running away . I live in New-street , Covent Garden ; and was in the Kitchen , when the Maid came and told me the things were stole out of the Yard . When the Prisoner was taken , he desired me to advertise the Goods , and told me if I would be at one Day 's expence , he would be at another . Elizabeth Swift . On the 22d of March , I wash 'd some Linnen for Mr Wren , and hung the things up on the Horse in the Yard , near our Kitchen-door . At 11 in the Evening , I heard the Footsteps of somebody in the Entry , and taking up a Candle , I saw the Linnen was gone . I heard some Person treading down the Entry , but the Wind took my Candle , and I never saw the Prisoner , 'till he was knocked down by the Watchman . Robert Swift . I serve Mr Wren as a Journeyman , and happened to be there on Saturday Night the 22d of March . About 11 o'Clock my Master and I were sitting by the Fireside , and as my Wife was washing the Dishes , she said she heard somebody trip along in the Yard ; she ran and found the Cloaths gone ; and I took a Candle and a Stick , and ran across the Yard into the Entry , where I found the Prisoner , and by the Light of my Candle , he found his Way into the Street . There is a Hatch at the End of the Entry without either Lock or Latch , which opens with pushing , or pulling , and shuts to of it self . The Prisoner pull 'd open this Hatch , and shut it to , after him , which stopped me a little ; but I saw him running , and cried stop Thief , - and the Prisoner cried stop Thief too , by which means he passed by a little Watchman , because he did not know who to knock down . But when the Watchman saw me , then he and I pursued the Prisoner into Bedford-street , Covent Garden , where another taller Watchman knocked him down , when I was not above 10 or 15 Yards from him.I kept my Eye upon the Prisoner , from the Time he ran out of the Entry 'till he was knocked down by the tall Watchman : and I am sure the Man who was knocked down , was the same Man , who ran out of our Passage . I am positive the Prisoner is the Man . Prisoner . What Cloaths had I on when I was knocked down ? Swift . Not that Coat which he has on now . It was a caped Coat , but not so light as that which he has now on . Prisoner . The Coat I had then on is now in Newgate I 'll send for it - No ; I wo n't give the Court so much Trouble . But pray did you see any thing in my Hands , when you pursued me ? Swift . No nothing at all . Jervase Bellace . I am a Watchman , and was at my stand , on Saturday , the 22d of March , a little after 11 , and had just hung up my Lanthorn , when a great outcry was made , - stop Thief ! So I took down my Lanthorn and ran into the Middle of the Street , where I stood to see who ran by . The Prisoner came running down the Street at a great Rate , and got past me , but I turned short about , and knocked him down . Swift came up to me directly upon the Prisoner 's falling , and said he was the Man , and he had never been out of his sight . On Sunday he was carried before Colonel De Veil , and in the Colonel 's Entry , in my hearing , the Prisoner offered to make Mr. Wren full satisfaction for the Goods . He made the same offer , before the Colonel ; and the Prosecutor I believe would have made it up , if the Colonel would have suffered him to have so done . Wren The Prisoner asked me , what the Value of my Goods was ? and I told him , I believed they were worth about a Guinea . He told me if I would not prosecute him , he would pay the Guinea with all his Heart : and because he had no Money , he offered to leave his Cloaths with me . When I was before Colonel De Veil , I would have made an End of it , if I could . Prisoner , to Bellace . Had I any Goods upon me , when I was taken ? Bellace . The Constable neglected to search him , 'till after he was put into the Hole , and then we found nothing upon him . Prisoner . What Cloaths had I then on ? Bellace . Not the Cloaths he has on now . He had then on him a large cap 'd Coat , of a grey or drab Colour . Richard Barber . On the 22d of March , between 11 and 12 , as I was at my Stand , the People cry 'd , Stop Thief ! The Prisoner was in the Mob , and cry 'd , Stop Thief too ; and I pursued , but did not know who was the right Thief ; but my Brother-Watchman knocked him down because he would not stop ; and Swift was running after him , the same Time , and said the Prisoner was the Man who had stole the Linnen . We found nothing upon him ; but I heard him offer to make Satisfaction for the Goods . DEFENCE . Sarah Hughes . I happened to be at one Mr Turner 's , at the Mogul 's Head , a Constable in Drury Lane , the 22d of March , and knowing the Prisoner to be an honest , just Man , I sent for him to go home with me , about half an Hour after 10 at Night . I live hard by Charing-Cross , and he saw me home thro ' Bedford-Court , - quite to my own House . We did not pass thro ' New-Street , where the Prosecutor lives . The Prisoner lives at one Mr Lyon 's , I do n't know where , - somewhere in Drury Lane , and he took his Leave of me , ( to go home ) about half an Hour after 10 , or near 11 o'Clock . I have known him these six Years and better : he lived about a Year ago in the next Room to mine . I take in Washing , and have entrusted him in my Room , when I have had thirty or forty Pounds-worth of Linnen there , and he always behaved honestly . His Business is to carry a Chair , and during the Time of the Frost , he was ready to go on Errands , and has fetched me Water for my Work . I have seen him plying , and carrying a Chair about Charing-Cross ; I saw him plying there last February , and the beginning of March . William Lyons . I am a Sawyer by Trade , and live in Drury Lane . I have known the Prisoner between 8 and 10 Years . He lodged in my House all the hard Frost , - upwards of five Months . He did follow Chairmen 's Business , and when he was out of Work , I used to help him to Business as a Porter . He ply 'd about Charing-Cross , and Spring-Gardens , but I know nothing of his Partner who used to carry the Chair with him . I never saw him at my House . I know nothing of him . - I have seen him ; he has been with the Prisoner at my House . Elizabeth Lyons . The Prisoner lived at our House , and behaved well ; I am Wife of the last Witness ; I know the Prisoner carried a Chair , and ply 'd about Brownlow-Street , and Drury-Lane I mean , low-Street , and Russell Street and that Way , and about Covent-Garden , and St. James 's but he generally ply 'd about Covent-Garden , and Drury-Lane . I have seen him in Bow-Street , with his Straps on , and his Partner was with him . I forget his Partner 's Sirname , but he lived with his Sister at the Coach and Horses in Drury-Lane , and his Christian-namewas William . When they had nothing to do they used to help my Husband to saw Timber . Thomas Williams . I am a Sawyer I live in Bowl-Yard , and am Lyons 's Partner . The Prisoner lived in his House , and I never heard any thing in the World , but that he was an honest Fellow . He used to tell me he follow 'd Chair-work about St. James 's , but I never saw him at Work , because I never walked that Way . I have seen him at Lyons 's House , with Straps on . William Moss , Serjeant . The Prisoner has been in our Company about 10 Months , and in case he should have proved his Character , I should have taken Care of him , and have carried him to another Place . I never saw him carry a Chair , but he has had a Chairman 's Coat and Straps on in the Tower , and behaved well while he was in the Barracks . Catharine Hall was called by the Prisoner , but when she appeared , he would not have her sworn , because she was not the right Catharine Hall . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 231 . + Edward Barton , the elder , of the County of Southampton , Gent . was indicted for feloniously and fraudently making , forging , and counterfeiting , and causing to be made , forged and counterfeited , in the Parish of St. Dunstan 's in the West , February 25th , 1739 , a certain sealed Writing-Obligatory , called a Bond , with the Name of George Collins thereunto subscribed , and the counterfeit Mark of Nicholas Collins thereunto made . With a Condition thereunder , importing an Obligation for the Payment of 83 £ . and bearing Date the 9th of June , 1729 . With Intent to defraud the said George Collins and Nicholas Collins , against the Form of the Statute , & c. He was also charged with uttering and publishing the same , in the Parish of St. Dunstan 's in the West , knowing it to be false , forged and counterfeit , February 25 . The Counsel for the Prosecution having opened the Charge , proceeded to take Notice of the Nature of the Evidence , they should produce in order to support it , viz . That Mr. Barton had been employed as an Attorney by the two Collins 's , in several Lawsuits ; and 84 £ . 16 s. and 6 d. being ( as he said ) due to him , on account of Business he had transacted for them ; they gave him for his Security a Bond for 83 £ . - and that the Persons who witnessed that Bond , were Honour Luff and Nicholas Luff . That the Prosecutors some Time after , ( being dissatisfied with Mr. Barton 's acting for them as an Attorney ) employed one Mr. Read , ( another Attorney in the Neighbourhood ) to transact their future Business ; upon which Mr. Barton began to put this Bond into Execution against the two Collins 's . But by Mr. Read 's Advice , the Collins 's complained to the Court of Common Pleas , and pray 'd , that the whole Affair , and all the Accounts subsisting between them and Mr. Barton , might be examined and settled by the Prothonotary . Which being ordered by the Court , the present Defendant , ( Mr. Barton ) appeared personally , and produced this Bond , ( which the Indictment charges to be forged and counterfeit ) instead of the true Bond , which the Prosecutors in this Cause , acknowledge had been given to Mr. Barton , and on the Back of which , ( they say ) there was an Indorsement of 20 £ . which the two Collins 's had paid off , and for which Mr. Barton had given a Receipt . That this Bond , without any such Indorsement on the Back , is what they now complained of , and tho ' it is witnessed by Honour Luss , who was a subscribing Witness to the true Bond , and by the Son of Mr. Barton ; yet , she says , she never subscribed as a Witness to any Bond , in which Mr. Barton the younger was a joint Witness with her , & c. John Collins the Elder . I have known Mr. Barton the elder , many Years , I never saw him write his Name himself , but I have seen his Name to a great many Papers . I am acquainted with his Handwriting , and I believe the filling up in the Body of this Bond , may be his Hand-writing . I have seen him write other Writings , tho ' I have not seen him write his Name , and I believe this filling up , tallies with his Manner of writing . I believe so ; but I ca n't be positive to such Things . The Name - George Collins , which is opposite to the first Seal , I believe is not George Collins 's Hand , to the best of what I know . Here are several Letters not like his writing , the C for one , and likewise the E , none of them compares rightly with his Hand . - I do n't say all of them , - some of the Letters may . To the best of my Knowledge this is not George Collins 's writing , John Collins the younger . The writing in the Obligation Part of this Bond , I take to be Mr. Barton 's the elder . I have been acquainted with his Manner of writing , six or seven Years , and this is very much like his Hand-writing ; for I have seen him write several Times . I have known Mr. Barton ten or eleven Years , - twenty Years by Sight . As to the filling up of the Bond , [ between the Printing , ] I take it to be Mr. Barton 's the elder , but I can say no farther than my Belief . The Name George Collins underneath , I take not to be Collins 's writing , because in December , 1735 , I was with Collins at Mr. Barton 's Office , and in talking over their Affairs , I heard George Collins say to Mr. Bar-ton , - you know I have given you a Bond for 83 £ . and Nicholas Luff and Honoria Luff were Witnesses to it ; and Mr Barton said , Yes , in answer to what Collins had said . George Collins , farther said , - you know I have paid 20 £ . off that Bond , and have your Receipt for it ; but Mr Barton said , he did not remember it ; if he had , he did not know what to say to it ; but if he had , it must be so . I know nothing about the Mark of Nicholas Collins . This Conversation passed between Collins and Mr Barton , at Mr Barton 's Office in the Hop-Garden and there was no one but us three present . Mr Barton complained to Collins , that he owed him a great deal of Money , and that occasioned Collins to tell him of the Bond he had given him . I was at Mr Barton 's Office once before this Time , and when I came away , he read a Paper to me , and told me , if I would get George Collins to sign it , he would make me a handsome Present for a Pair of Gloves . George Collins was not Present when Mr Barton said this to me , nor do I remember what were the Contents of the Paper . Couns . Let us know how this Conversation began ? John Collins , jun . Mr Barton seemed in a stern Humour with Collins , and told him , he owed him a great deal of Money ; and that he could not keep the Injunction on Foot ; and if he did not , there would come out an Execution against him , and his Stock would be taken ; and how , ( says Mr Barton ) shall I raise Money ? Why , ( says Collins ) if you had paid Mrs Bailey 's 200 £ . off , as you have had the Money , that would have put a Stop to this Affair . Mr Barton told him , he owed him a great deal of Money himself . Sir , ( says Collins ) what would you have me do ? You have got my All , - I have assigned every Thing to you . I have given you a Bond of 83 £ . witnessed by two Persons ; and an 80 £ . Bond to make up the Money to pay Mrs Bailey off . Mr. Barton upon this agreed , that Collins had given him an 80 £ . Bond to make up the Money which was to pay Mrs Bailey , and I think he told him , he had been Security to Mrs Bailey , for the Money he ( Collins ) owed . Prisoner 's Q . Was not that 80 £ . Bond , to indemnify Mr Barton on account of that Security ? Collins . I do n't know that . - But Mr Barton was Security for George Collins , to get him out of Goal , I believe . I remember this Conversation passed in December , 1735 . I made some Entries in my Day-Book , the beginning of December , concerning some Business I had done for the Collins 's at the same Time . I am a Taylor , and live with my Father John Collins . The Entries I made in my Book , were Accounts of some Travels I had made for them in their Trouble , and the Charges I had been at . Counc . Was there any mention made of any other 83 £ . Bond , beside that signed by Sister Luff , and Nicholas Luff ? Collins . No . [ The Counsel shew 'd John Collins junior several Papers signed with the Name of George Collins : all which he believed were George 's Handwriting , except one , which he believed was not . ] Honoria Luff . I know both Mr Barton and the two Collins 's , George and Nicholas : I remember their giving Mr Barton a Bond for 83 l. ; I was one of the Witnesses to it , and Nicholas Luff was the other . and I never was a Witness to any other , but one : and in that one John Hyde was a Witness with me . But I never witnessed a Bond for 83 l. in my Life , with Mr Barton the younger . When George and Nicholas Collins gave Mr Barton the 83 l. Bond , I made my Mark , as a Witness , and Nicholas Luff wrote his Name , to it : but I am very sure the Mark upon this Bond , is not mine , because here is not the other right Witness 's Name , but young Mr Barton 's : and therefore I apprehend 't is not my Mark . If it had been mine , Nicholas Luff would have been the other Witness . That Bond which I was a Witness to , was dated the 9th of June 1729 . Couns . Where was the Bond executed , which you set your Mark to . Honoria Luff . In George Collins 's Brick-Kitchen ; George and Nicholas Collins were present , and Mr Barton the Elder , my self , Nicholas Luff , and Ann Luff , my Mother . - I ca n't say how many Bonds ( given by the Collins 's ) I have been a Witness to , but I am sure I never witnessed any Bond , when young Mr Barton was even in the same Room . Prisoner 's Q . Did you never say you could write , at the Time this Mark is supposed to have been made ? Honoria Luff . No , I never said any such thing . Couns . Look on that Bill of Costs , in Consideration of which the 83 l. Bond was given . Honoria Luff . This Paper Mr Barton delivered to George Collins , at his House , the same Day the Bond was executed . I ca n't swear I saw Mr Barton write it , but I saw him write the Receipt . I do think I saw him write his Name to it , but I ca n't be positive to that . I have seen Mr Barton the younger write , tho ' not very often , and I believe this Name of Edward Barton the younger was wrote by Mr Barton the elder . I can write my self now , and can read Writing , but I do n't pretend to know Handwriting . The Bond ( in Dispute ) was read . Itwas for 83 l. signed Geo . Collins : and marked , Nicholas Collins . Attested by Honoria Luff , and Edward Barton , junior . The Bill of Costs amounting to 84 l. 16 s. 6 d. was read , at the Foot of which was the following Receipt . June the 9th 1729 . Received then the Sum of 83 Pounds by Bond , for a security for the said Sum ; which when paid will be in full of all Demands . Edward Barton , senior . George Collins was called , but the Defendant 's Counsel objecting that he was concerned in Point of Interest , the Counsel for the Prosecution called Mr Warren to prove that the Bond had been paid and that General Releases had been executed on both sides . He deposed that the Release produced in Court , he saw executed by Mr Barton the elder , as his Act and Deed ; and that there had been one given by George Collins about a Month before , but none by Nicholas Collins . ( The produced Release , was signed Edward Barton , senior ; and dated , 11th of Feb . 1737 . ) And he farther deposed that the Release was given after the Matter had been before the Prothonotary . - He added that the 20 l. mentioned in the opening the Evidence , was never mentioned , or thought ( in the former Proceedings ) to be in discharge of any Part of the 83 l. Bond : But that Collins having had a suit with the Widow Oakingham ; the 83 l. Bond was in Discharge of other Law Charges generally , and was not in Part of this Affair of Oakingham 's . He was asked by the Prisoner 's Counsel , if there was not a Demand made on Account of this Bond ? He answered , that when the Bonds were before Mr Prothomotary Cook , Collins complited that they were given when the Money was not all due ; upon which Mr Cook ordered a General Bill of Costs should be laid by Mr Barton before him , and that no Regard should be paid to the Bonds , therefore he could not say the Bonds were considered at all . Some farther Objections being made to George Collins 's being called , the same were allowed , and he was not sworn . Mr Protary Cook gave an Account , that the Affair was before him about two Years ago , and that he intended to have stated what was due from Collins to Mr Barton , both on the Bonds , and on the Taxation of his Bills , and to have added the In-next due upon the Bonds , to the Account ; and that when this Bond [ which Mr Cook had mark 'd ] was before him , there was some Objection made , on Account of Mr Barton 's having sworn that Honoria Luff had signed her Name thereto , when she had only made her Mark to it : but he did not remember that any other Objection was made to it at that Time . Mr Warren likewise deposed , that there was no Objection made to the Bond at that Time . Mr Cook farther deposed that the Bond was produced at his Office ( which he deemed to be in London ) as a Demand for so much Money , by one Drury , for Mr Barton . Nicholas Luff , deposed that he set his Hand as a Witness , to a Bond for 83 l. on the 9th of June 1729 ; that Honour Luff was a Witness with him at the same Time ; and that young Mr Barton was not a Witness to it , nor was he then in the House . That George and Nicholas Collins , Honour Luff , Ann Luff , the elder , Mr Barton and he were present at the same Time , in George Collins 's Kitchen , which had a Brick-Floor . He saw no other Paper or Papers produced at that Time ; but he said he was abroad , and was sent for , to sign as a Witness , and he believed his Sister Luff , was there all the Time . Henry Read . I have seen Mr Barton the elder write ; and I believe the filling up of this Bond is his Writing . I have not seen Mr Barton the younger write , so as to be positive whether his Name is of his own Hand-writing : 't is a great deal more like Mr Barton the elder 's , than his Son 's . I am unwilling to answer , because I ca n't speak positively , nor with certainty . It has the Likeness in all Respects to Mr Barton 's the elder , and is not like the younger 's . He is 22 or 23 Years of Age . - To be sure I am mistaken he must be more . Prisoner 's Q . What is the Character of Nicholas Collins ? Mr Read . He is looked upon to be a Man of an exceeding good Character . As to John Collins , senior and junior , and Honour Luff , I know nothing of them my self , but their general Character is , that they are very troublesome People . Honour Luff has been looked upon as one concerned in such Affairs , but I have not known her to forswear her self . I have great Reason to believe the contrary , for I never saw any body more cautious , than she was , when she made her Affidavit . Prisoner 's Q . Have you never had any Conversation , with one Hammond about them ? Mr. Read . I do n't remember . - I am not concerned in this Prosecution ; nor do I know the Persons who are . Philip Bigg . I have seen Mr Barton the elder very often ; but I never saw him write : and I am but very little acquainted with young Mr Barton ; - I never saw him write at all . Mr Read . I attended Sir George Cook at his Office , and remember this Bond 's being produced by Mr Barton the elder . I remember his taking itout of a Bag of Papers , as a Voucher , on the Bills which were taxed , and to prove that he had such a Demand . I believe this was at the Prothonotary 's Office . Mr. Barton , in his Defence , gave an Account of the several Affairs he had transacted for George and Nicholas Collins , from the 22d of April 1728 ; and that in June 1729 , there was 80 odd Pounds due to him , for Business he had done , and Money he had expended for them . That they being lamentably Poor , and having another Cause depending in Chancery , invited him and his Son to come and dine with them , promising to give him some Security for his Debt . That they accordingly went ; and the Bills being satisfactory , the Account between them was then adjusted , and amounted to 84 l. 16 s. and 6 d. That , at their Request , he abated 1 l. 16 s. and 6 d. and they gave him a Bond for the 83 l. to which Honour Luff made her Mark , and his Son signed his Name , as attesting Witnesses . He gave farther an Account of the Business he had done for them , after their having executed this Bond , and the counter Securities they had given him for the Expence and Trouble he had been at in the Management of their Causes ; and of the several Transactions which passed between them till the Affair was adjusted , and settled by the Prothonotary . Edward Barton , Jun . I was my Father 's Clerk when the Bond for 83 £ . was given by George and Nicholas Collins . Couns . How old are you ! Mr Barton , jun . I shall be thirty Years old the sixth of November next . I had been Clerk with my Father better than a Year , at that Time ; and was then almost nineteen . It was usual for me to go with him to execute Writings ; and I am positive this is my Hand to this Bond : it was given at Exon , in the House of George Collins . My Father had been concerned for the two Collins 's , in a great many Causes , and there was due , on several Bills , the Sum of 84 £ . 16 s. and 6 d. He abated 1 £ . 16 s. and 6 d. and this Bond was given for the remaining 83 £ . - I saw George Collins write his Name to this Bond : He sealed and delivered it , and Honour Luff was present at the same Time ; she made her Mark to it , and I wrote my Name to it , as Witnesses . This Name ( Edward Barton ) is my own Hand-writing , and the Writing ( the Mark of Honour Luff ) is my Father 's . The Bond likewise was filled up by my Father . Couns . Who was present at the Time when this Bond was executed ? Mr Barton , jun . George and Nicholas Collins , George Collins 's Wife , Honoria Luff , Ann Luff , and a Person that came in and out , as a Servant , in a Carter 's Surplice ; who he was I can not tell . I was a Witness to Writings two Years before this , - in the Year 27 . This is my Hand on the Back of this Parchment ; and the middle Name is my Hand , on the Back of this other . These Deeds I engrossed myself , and often went with my Father to attest Writings . Couns . Was this Bond filled up before you went to Collins 's , or after you came to his House ? Mr. Barton , jun . I believe my Father filled it up after we went there ; and it was executed in the Kitchen ? Couns . What Floor had the Kitchen ? Mr Barton , jun . I can not charge my Memory with that . We both dined there that Day , and I think we had some Fowls and a Piece of Bacon for Dinner . Couns . Did you see Nicholas Luff there ? Mr Barton , jun . I do n't remember I did . If I did , he appeared as a Servant , in and out : I did not mind him as a Person concerned ; and I do n't know that I have ever seen him before , or since . Q . Look again upon your Name : Is the Word Junior your Hand-writing ? Mr Barton , jun . Yes , I do believe it is . - Williamson , Esq ; I do n't know much of the Collins 's myself : but by all Report , their general Character is very bad . I have heard they are very litigious People , and frequently concerned in Law-suits . They bear so very bad a Character , that I would not believe them , upon their Oaths ; and I believe a great many others would not . I think their Characters are so very bad , that they ought not to be believed . Prisoner 's Q. I think , Sir , you was High-Sheriff of the County last Year ? Mr Williamson . Yes , I was . I live in Exon : the two John Collins 's live in Hambleden Parish , three or four Miles distant . Honour Luff lives in my Parish ; she bears a very bad Character , I am upon my Oath , - I should not care to believe her upon her Oath . Mr. Bonbam . I know John Collins and Honour Luff . I formerly lived near them : but I now live seven or eight Miles distant from them . They never wronged me , but their general Character in the Neighbourhood is an evil one : 't is generally bad . I should give no Credit to him , or her , tho ' they were upon Oath . Mr. Barton I have known thirty Years ; he is a Gentleman of a good paternal Estate , and married a Woman of a good Family.I do n't believe he is capable of being guilty of Forgery ; nor is there a Man in our Country who believes him guilty . His Character is a very good one ? Couns . Have you seen Collins within these seven Years ? Mr Bonham . I do n't know whether I have or not . I saw Honour Luff some Months ago at Alresford . I knew her before that Time . I have an Estate within a Mile of the Place where they all live ; and all People give them evil Character . John Barnard , Esq ; I know Collins of Hambledon the elder . About 10 Years ago , his Son was indicted for setting the Moors on Fire : I did not know Collins the younger before that Time . And Honour Luff I have known twenty Years . The general Characters of them all three are bad , and I really believe none of them are to be credited . Mr Barton bears as good a Character as any Gentleman in the County : He 's a Man of good Substance , and I believe would scorn to do what he 's charged with , as much as any Man in the Kingdom . - Penton , Esq ; I have known Mr Barton , 15 , 16 , or 20 Years : He has a very good Character , and has always behaved well in his Profession . He is a Man of Fortune , not much less than 200 £ . a Year ; but I do n't know his Circumstances particularly . His general Character is exceeding good , and I believe he would by no means do a thing of this Sort . I know nothing at all of the Collins 's : I live about seven Miles from Mr Barton . Mr Clark . In 1704 , I got Mr Barton sworn an Attorney : he has done Business for me ; I never knew him do an unfair Thing : but he always behaved as well as ever I knew a Man in my Life , and I took him to be a very honest Man . Edward Wools . I do n't know the two Collins 's ; I have no Acquaintance with them myself . I live about nine Miles from them , but from the Character I have heard of John and Nicholas Collins , and Honour Luff , I think they ought not to be believed upon their Oaths . William Collier . The 2 Collins 's and Honour Luff bear a very bad Character , and I believe are not to be credited upon Oath . I never heard any body speak well of them in my Life . I live about eight or nine Miles off , but their Characters ring pretty much about the Country , - farther than eight or nine Miles . I heard this Character of them before Mr. Barton was concerned for them . Edward Snuggs . I know the two Collins 's and Honour Luff . I live within four Miles of the two John Collins 's . They all three have very bad Characters ; and I do n't think they ought to be believed upon Oath . Edward Hooper , Esq ; I have known Mr Barton twenty Years , and never heard but that he bore an exceeding good Character . His Family is very well respected in the Country , I always took him to be a Man of Substance , and belov 'd by all his Neighbours . I am in the Commission of the Peace myself , and have often heard the Gentlemen in the Commission complain of the Collins 's being uneasy troublesome Fellows . They have the Characters of bad Men ; and if they were to come to me for a Warrant I would not take their Oaths . I do n't know the Christian Names of the Collins 's , but I never knew that there were more than two of them . I do n't know Honour Luff . Couns . If they have such bad Characters , do you think Mr Barton , ( who has such a good one ) would have been employed by them ? Mr Hooper . Probably he might not know them . Mary Webb . I know the two John Collins 's and Honour Luff very well . I live about two or three Stonescast from Honour Luff . Their general Character is so very bad , that I think they are not to be believed upon their Oaths . I have known them ten Years ; but I have not kept them Company a great while . I rent a House of them , yet I never go near them , but when I carry my Rent ; and then I never stay longer than I have an Acquittance . Charles Mitchell . I know the two John Collins 's , and their Characters are very bad . The major Part of the People in the Country would not believe what they say ; I would not believe them , on their Oaths . Edward Astlet . I know nothing of the two Collins 's ; but Mr Barton I have known these thirty Years . He has done Business , as an Attorney , for me and my Father , several Years . He has a very good Character , and I do n't think he would be guilty of what is now laid to his Charge . Thomas Hamman . The two Collins 's are reckoned very bad Persons by all that know them . They have been at Law these 16 Years . I know nothing of Honour Luff ; - I have heard a bad Character of her , but I am not to go into Particulars , I think they are not to be believed upon Oath . Mr Barton I have known 16 or 17 Years , he has as good a Character as any of his Profession in the Kingdom . No Man more religious and devout , nor better respected than he is . I am Deputy-Register under the Bishop of Winchester , and he has an Office under the Bishop now . When I was at our Assizes last Summer , Mr Read came over to our Office , and I said to him , - Mr Read , I have heard a very odd Thing , - that a Gentleman is charged with a bad Fact , who has the best of Cha-racters , - and I hear 't is by the Collins 's and Honour Luff , who are People of bad Characters . He answered - Honour Luff is a mad Girl , and as for the two Collins 's , nobody will believe them : Mr Barton , ( said he ) was not cautious enough with them , - I never would trust them with my Hand-writing . John Hannington . I was at a Vestry with Mr Read and Mr Barton , junior , when they were rating the Parish-Books ; and when they came to Mr Barton 's Name , Mr Read raised it ; [ the Rate ] Mr Barton said , he would not have his Father 's House raised so by every Body : and Mr Read told him , he would humble him , and his Father too ; and said , Do n't you remember the Bond ? Thomas Newnham , Esq ; I have not known Mr Barton long , but I have known his Character ever since I lived in the County . I am not particularly acquainted with him , but I have often heard him spoken of as an honest Attorney I believe he is universally respected , and from the Character I have heard of him , I believe he is the last Man in the World who would be guilty of Forgery . Nicholas Pyle , Esq ; I have known Mr Barton about 15 or 20 Years : and always esteemed him a Man of Fortune , and Character ; and I can not think him guilty of any such Thing , but far from it . I have acted in the Commission of the Peace some Years , and take his Character to be very good . William Edwards . I know Honour Luff , she bears a very bad Character . I happened to be in the House with her about four Years ago , last February , and a Man who was present , said to her , if you would do yourself any good , you must deny all , and swear any thing . She answered , - she would deny all , and swear any thing before she would come to the Parish . Mr Porter . I have known Mr Barton 18 Years . He bears as good a Character as any Man in Hampshire , and I believe this to be a malicious Prosecution , in order to extort Money from him . I am subpcena 'd here with regard to Mr Barton : I am an Attorney , and am now concerned in a Cause for the Lady Boyce against the Collins 's . Mr Read . I have known the two John Collins 's and Honour Luff , 15 or 16 Years . As to Honour Luff , I never heard any thing amiss of her in my Life . As to old John Collins , I have : but young Collins , I believe he is an honest Man . Couns . Do you think old John Collins would forswear himself ? Mr Read . I do n't know . I believe Honour Luff would not : for she was very cautious in her Affidavit to ground the Suit in the Court of Common Pleas . Prisoner . I desire Mr Read may be asked , if he made no Declaration to Mr Hamman , that he believed the Collins 's were People of an ill character ? Mr Read . I have said old John Collins bears a bad character ; I believe the young one is an honest Man , and I have no Reason to distrust Honour Luff . I do n't recollect that I said she was a mad Girl . Mr Hamman wished they might not be troublesome to me ; and I said , I had done nothing for them , but what I had done for People who I thought were resied : but ( says I ) if they have a Mind to quarrel with me , I do n't know that I have given them any thing under my Hand . The Collins 's indeed have not been very grateful to me , for after I had done them all the Service I could , they were pleased to tax all my Bills . Richard Tribe . I have known Honour Luff a pretty many Years ; she bears a good Character as far as I have heard . She is a young Woman , and may be guilty of frisky things , but I never knew her guilty of any thing dishonourable . I believe she would not do wrong things , so much as many of the People who have been Evidences against her . I have known her and all the Collins 's 20 Years . John Collins the younger I have known ever since he was christened , and he bears a good Character , as far as I have heard . I believe he would no more take a false Oath , to take away a Man 's Life , than I would . I was born at Hambledon , in Hampshire , and was bred up a Surgeon , but I now keep a Publick Way , in London , and sell Wine , Brandy and Rum , wholesale and retale . I knew when old John Collins could be respected in the best of Company . He always behaved well in his youthful Days , and was well respected by 'Squires and Gentlemen , - the best in the Country , and was trusted by them . I never heard but that Mr Barton had a good Character ; and I have heard the several Gentlemen examined who have spoke against the Collins 's : but most of them who gave Evidence , never had any Dealings with them , then how should they give a Character of them truly ? - I live now near Hanover-Square : I have lived up and down , these 14 or 15 Years , sometimes in the Country , and sometimes in London : and I have lived at Times in the Neighbourhood of Hanover-Square , about 5 Years , and have let Lodgings , but now I have been a settled Housekeeper about 12 Months . I came from Hambledon about 17 Years ago , but Collins has been a Taylor to our Family for many Years . Thomas Martin . I have lived in London 26 Years , but I have known the two John Collins 's 30 Years . I was in Hampshire about 10 Years ago , and I wasthere again , about a Month ago . I do n't know Honour Luff , but the Collins 's I have seen frequently , and they bear a good Character . I do n't think they would forswear themselves . I am a Housekeeper in Trinity Minories . I am a Shoemaker by Trade , but now I clean Gloves , and carry a Light at Funerals . Thomas Batsman . I never was in Hampshire ; I live in the Strand , but I have known the two Collins 's 4 Years ; and I know Honour Luff likewise . They all bear good Characters as far as I know ; and I am acquainted with several People who come from that Place , tho ' I do n't live there my self . - Moody . I was bred and born , and now live in Hampshire , I have known the two Collins 's many Years ; Honour Luff I have known about a Year or two . I never heard any Harm of any of them in my Life . Couns . Do you think they would come here , and forswear themselves ? - Moody . I know nothing of that . I would not do it for all the World . - Cole . I live at Bishop 's Waltham in Hampshire , and have known Honour Luff 12 Years I believe . I have not had so much Acquaintance with her lately , as I had formerly . I never found but she bore a good Character : she always behaved well to me , and 't is my Opinion she would not forswear her self . I know but little of the Collins 's . - I am a House-Carpenter . I have not heard any body speak any thing about Honour Luff ( to signify ) lately . I never heard any body give her a bad Character , nor have I enquired any thing about it . John Goldsmith . I have known Honour Luff 10 Years , I live near her , and know no Harm of her , for my Part . Couns . Do you think she would forswear her self ? Goldsmith . As to her forswearing her self , - I have nothing to say , in that Respect . - As to her Character , I can say nothing , - as to her Character . I know the two Collins 's , and for my Part , I know no Harm of them . They have bad Characters , but I know no Harm of them . The Jury acquitted * the Prisoner . * It was moved that Mr Barton might have a Copy of his Indictment , but the Court ( after hearing Counsel on both sides ) would not grant it . 232 . + Alexander Lambley , of St James 's Clerkenwell , was indicted for feloniously and traiterously forging , counterfeiting and coining , 4 Pieces of false and feigned Money , to the likeness of the good and lawful Coin , called Shillings , & c. June 21 , against the Form of the Statute . Elizabeth Harris . I have been acquainted with the Prisoner above two Years . My Aunt ( Ursuld Harris ) kept a Chandler's-shop , in Tooley-Street , and he used to come to her House . The first Time he came was with one William May a Butcher , but both he and my Aunt are dead . We then sold Drams , and they had a Dram a-piece , and paid 3 d. in Copper . After this he came several Times , and I being a single Woman , and he a single Man , he frequently came to the House , to see me . Couns . Did you ever see him at Wood's-Close . Harris . Yes ; after he had been at our House , we grew intimate , and he fetched me there . I have been there several Times within this Year and a half . But after I had been there once or twice , I saw he had a Wife , and then I went to visit his Wife , and have seen him sell this false Money . Couns . Have you ever seen him do any thing to it ? Harris . I saw him put a Shilling between a Piece of Paper into a Hand-vice , at Wood's-Close , and rub round the Edges , with a three-square-file ; but I do n't know what condition it was in , before he rubbed it with the File , nor what he did to it afterwards . The second Shilling I saw was one which he offered to my Aunt ; but she looked at it , and gave it him again , telling him it was not a good one . He made a Laugh of it , and after he had rubbed it with some Powder , between his Finger and Thumb , he tossed it down on the counter and said , who would dispute that Shilling was not a good one . It looked like Lead before he had rubbed it , but afterwards it appeared like Silver . He afterwards told me , I might get a good Living , if I would dispose of such Shillings , and that he would give me 3 or 4 of them for a Shilling ; but I never had any from him to dispose of . He said , if he could not get 100 £ . a Year he could not live , and I might get a good Livelihood too if I would dispose of such Shillings . I never saw him rub or file them except once : but several Times when he has been at our House , he has appeared in a Hurry , and has said , he must go and put off his Tom Tits , and has thrown down a Piece of the Money on the counter , and said , - 't is as good a King William and Queen Mary as ever was coined . He pretended to be Hog-Butcher , andwhen I went to his House , I found very good Entertainment for Trades-people . He lodged up one Pair of Stairs , at a Widow 's House , in Wood's-Close , but I do n't know her Name . Couns . Did you ever see him put off this Money to any Body ? Harris . I have seen him give People three or four of these Pieces , as I have thought , and they have given him a Shilling for them . I have seen him three several Times give three for a Shilling : but I can not tell who the Persons were that took them , nor did I mind what the Prisoner said , when he sold them . Prisoner . When you was taken up you did not know your own Mother . Pray what House do I live in ? Harris . Between the Alehouse and the Barber 's Shop , in Wood's-Close . Prisoner . Tell me whereabouts in the Room is the Fire-place : where my Bed stands , and what Sort of a Woman my Wife is ? Harris . The Fire-place is on the farther Side of the Room ; the Bed may have been moved since I saw it , but his Wife is a little Woman , shorter than I am , and has a young Child . Prisoner . How come you to be perswaded to come and give Evidence now , when last sessions you would not appear ? Harris . I did not know the Consequence . - I have had no Perswasions , nor any Money ? Couns . He would have it understood , that you do n't know where he lodg 'd : Did not you carry the Persons who have the Charge of the Prosecution to the House ? Harris . Yes ; and I knocked at the Door . Prisoner . I never saw her in my Life , before this Morning . Harris . I know him , and have been at his House several Times . Couns . Can you recollect what Time it was , when you saw the Prisoner put the Shilling into the Hand-vice ? Harris . No ; - it was about a Twelvemonth ago , at Wood's-Close : and it was about a Quarter of a Year before that Time , when I saw him rub the Shilling at my Aunt 's in Tooley-street . Christopher Brown . I have known the Prisoner between two and three Years , - Prisoner . I am informed that Man has been in the Pillory for Perjury , and a Conspiracy against Drinkwater . He was convicted here two or three Years ago . Brown . I became acquainted with the Prisoner , by drinking with him at a Publick-house in Wood's-Close . I once saw him sell three or four of those Pieces for a Shilling , and have heard him say , if he could not get a Hundred a Year , he could not maintain his Family . And when some of the Shillings have looked like Lead , I have seen him rub them over with something white , and make them look like Silver . I ca n't take on me to say they were such Pieces ( before they were rubb 'd ) as are here in Court , but I have seen him rub them between his Finger and Thumb ; after which he has shewn them upon the Table , and said they look 'd like Silver . And they have looked like King William and Queen Mary 's Shillings . Those which I have seen upon the Prisoner , have not been so rough as these I see now . Couns . What Business did he say he followed ? Brown . He told me he was a Horse-Jockey ; and afterwards he said he was a Dealer in Hogs , and another Time he was a Polisher of Glass . I have seen him have Horses in Ward 's Rents , near Hockley in the Hole , where he had a House of his own , since Michaelmas last ; after he removed from Wood's-Close . I ca n't say what Business he did in that House , but he said , - provided there were Molds , or Money found there , it could not be proved that he put them there . Prisoner . Do you know one William Clark ? Brown . I do n't know any such Man . - O ! I believe he is a Clogmaker ; but I never saw him with the Prisoner in my Life ; nor have I ever had any Talk with Clark , about the Prisoner , nor about this Prosecution : but Clark 's Character is very dull , if Clark comes to that . Prisoner . Have not I told the Truth about your having stood in the Pillory ? Brown . I have nothing to say to that . John Cart . I live in Wood's-Close , and am a Carpenter . On the 21st of June , as I was pulling down the House of Office , where the Prisoner lodged , I found this Bag of counterfeit Money , under the Seat . There were fourscore and four Shillings concealed upon a Board ; where they could not be seen , though searched for with a candle ; and could only be found , by putting a Hand thro ' the Hole , and turning it under the Seat . I know the Prisoner lodged in that House , and continued there a Quarter of a Year after this Thing was rumoured about , and talked of . Harris . The Piece I saw him rub with a File in the Hand-vice , was like these , but I ca n't swear to it . Jane Watson . The Prisoner lodged in my House in Wood's-Close , about a Year and three Quarters : and I know there was a Parcel of bad Money foundin the Vault , but I do n't know who put it there . When he lived with me , he behaved civilly , and paid me my Rent , in good Money . When he came first to my House , he dealt in Horses ; I do n't know what Business he followed afterwards . I know there was bad Money found in the Vault that he used to go to , as well as the rest of the Lodgers . - I never saw any bad Money upon him , but I never go into my Lodgers Rooms ; I was not fix Times in the Room while he was in it , so I ca n't tell what he did there . He lodged in my House when the Money was found ; I suspected him , and gave him warning two or three Days after it was discovered , and I think he went away a Month before Michaelmas . Couns . Had you any other Lodgers in the House at that Time ? Watson . No ; none but the Prisoner and his Wife , and an old Gentlewoman who boards with me . There had no other Person lodged in the House , for a quarter of a Year before the Money was found . - The Vault only belongs to our House , and none but our own People can go to it . John Blackwell , I keep a Coffee-House in Well-Court , in Queen-Street . I have seen the Prisoner before ; and believe he is the same Person who came twice to our House , and changed a Shilling each Time , to pay for what he had , and we found a bad Shilling both Times in the Drawer after he was gone . The third Time he came was last December was 12 Months , and he then changed a good Six-pence to pay for a Dish of Coffee , and went out ! In half an Hour he returned again , and called for a Glass of Ale , and some Tobacco , after which he offered my Wife a bad Shilling ; she told him , it was not a good one ; but before I could get to the Bar , he had snatched it up , and had laid down a good one . I told him , he was a vile Fellow , and that this was the third Time he had served me so . The Gentlemen in the House said , I ought to secure him ; upon which he fled for it , and got 100 Yards from the House , but I pursued him , and tho ' he resisted , I took him , and asked him , what need had he to change a Shilling , when he had changed Six-pence but ++ of an Hour before ? He said he had no Half-pence , but when the Constable came we searched him , and found fifteen or 16 good Shillings upon him ; one bad one ; and about three Shillings in Half-pence , more than he had received from us in change . He then offered to spend a Crown in the House , if I would let him go ; I refused to discharge him , and carried him before Mr Alderman Perry , and produced the bad Shilling we found upon him , but not being able to swear it was the same identical Shilling , which he had offered in Payment , he was discharged . Couns . Did the bad Shilling which you found upon him , tally with the other two you had taken before ? Mr Blackwell . Yes ; so very exactly and minutely , that several Gentlemen in the Room were of Opinion , they were all made in the same Mold . That which I found upon him was broke , that it might go no farther , - it was a King William 's , and the Date was 1696 . Couns . These now produced are King William 's , 1696 . Harris . I ca n't tell what Impression was on the Piece which I saw him put into the Hand-vice : nor can I tell whether the Edges were smooth before he filed them . He did not let me see that Piece . That which I saw him rub between his Fingers , he tossed down , and said , there 's as good a King William 's and Queen Mary 's , as ever was coined : and I saw something of a Head upon that , I am certain : but it did not found like good Money . Samuel Etheridge confirm 'd Mr Blackwell 's Evidence , and added , that he went to the Prisoner in Gaol , and asked him , if he had ever been at Blackwell 's Coffee-House ? To which the Prisoner answered , No ; nor did he know where it was . Mr North deposed , That he having secured one Thomas Wood . for uttering counterfeit Money . Brown , ( a former Witness ) sent for him to a Tavern , and told him , that the Prisoner ( who had married Wood 's Daughter ) was one who counterfeited the Coin , and put it off . That he took the Prisoner upon this Information , and searched his House in Ward 's Rout 's , but found nothing , except some Powder in some little Holes and Corners of the House , which answered the Description of that which Brown said he had seen him rub the Shillings with . That the Prisoner had prevaricated in all the Answers to the Questions he put to him , and denied that he had ever been at Blackwell 's Coffee-House in his Life . The Prisoner desired Mr North might be becaked , if he had not given Christopher Brown , otherwise Bawes , Money to appear against him ? Mr North answered , that Brown was poor , and as he offered himself voluntarily , he had given a Shilling , now and then , - and sometimes 2 s. or half a Crown , once in a Week , or a Fortnight : and that he once gave Harris three Shillings . Harris deposed , that that Money was not given her to swear against the Prisoner . Mr North added , that before last sessions , sBrown went away from his Lodgings , and he knew not whereto find either him , or Harris , when he wanted their Testimony . But that one Serjeant came afterwards to him , and told him , if he would make it worth his while , he ( Serjeant ) would help him to Brown and Harris . That to induce Serjeant to discover where these People might be found , he offered him a Guinea , and upon Serjeant 's telling him they were afraid to see him , because they had had some Money from him , he gave him a Note , in which he promised not to give them any Trouble on that Account . Robert Anderson deposed , that he went with Harris to the Prisoner 's House , and had Orders to take particular Notice , whether she knew it . That he walked before her , and went past the House , but she called him back , and shewed it him . Jury to Watson the Landlady . Have you seen Harris come to your House after the Prisoner ? Watson . I do n't remember her : but I did not mind who came after him . Jury to Brown . Is Brown your true Name ? Brown . Yes ; my Name is Christopher Brown : I have not gone by any other Name for some Years . Prisoner . Was not you charged with a Conspiracy by the Name of Bews ? Brown . I was charged with a Conspiracy against Drinkwater , by a Person whom I never saw in my Life . I was indicted by the Name of Baws , and not Bews . * See January Sessions , 1737. William Clark . I know Bews , he lived in the same House with me , and went by that Name , as well as by Brown . About Christmas last he came to me , and said , there is a Man in the Counter for counterfeiting the Coin , and you may do a Thing which wo n't hurt you , and you may get 40 £ . in your Pocket . If you 'll go along with me , I 'll shew you the Man , and the House where he lived , that you may be the more positive : and if you 'll do this you may be relieved , till his Trial comes on . - I was to swear I saw him counterfeit the King 's Coin . I never saw the Prisoner , till about two Hours ago , I was going to buy two Shilling 's worth of Velvet to make Cloggs , and Mr Serjeant told me , the Prisoner was to be tried to Day , and that it would be of Service to him to come here ; so I came voluntarily . Brown . This Fellow sends his Wife out a-whoring for Six-pence a Night , and it is the only Way of living he has . Mr Pankerman gave an Account that the Prisoner worked with him as a Distiller about the Time of the Date of the Prosecution , and had lived with him half a Year before . That he had worked with him at Times , for seven Years past , but had left him in July last . That he found him honest while he lived with him , but knew nothing of him since July . He added , that he believed the Prisoner had kept Hogs and Horses too , and that the Prisoner 's Father was an honest Man .

On the 21st of March , about 10 o'clock at Night , I was laid hold of by a Girl in Fleet-street , who desired me to give her a Pint of Wine : I refused ; and while I was talking to the Girl who had stopped me , and held me by the Sleeve , the Prisoner came up ; and getting between the first Woman and me , she ( the Prisoner ) put her Hand into my left Breeches Pocket , and pulled out a Specimen of Minerals , which she dropped in the Street . I was sensible of it , and pulled her Hand immediately out of my Pocket , and told her to take Care of herself , for if she persisted in such Actions , she would come to the Gallows : and for Fear my Watch should be taken , I kept my Right-hand upon my Fob . The other Girl , who then stood on my left Side , picked my Handkerchief out of my Pocket , and told the Prisoner , she had got it . Hearing this , I took my Hand from my Fob , to feel whether my Handkerchief was gone , and , in the mean Time , the Prisoner picked my Watch out of my Fob . Upon this I seizedthem both , by the Handkerchiefs which they had about their Necks : and the Woman who took my Handkerchief slipped away , and left her Handkerchief in my Hand , but the Prisoner , who took my Watch , I secured . I felt in my Fob , the Moment the other Girl fled , and my Watch was gone . I missed it in half a Minute after I had taken my Hand from my Fob . When I laid hold of the Prisoner , she would have got away , and her Handkerchief came off in my Hand , with a Piece of her Shift : but I held her , and called Watch ! She then desired me to go with her up the Alley , to see for her Accomplice , who ( she said ) had got the Watch : and I went with her to a House in the Alley , but the Woman of the House would give us no Information , either of the Woman or the Watch . The Prisoner I am sure took my Watch , and I apprehend handed it to the other who got away : and the Reason of my certainty is , because the other Woman was at a Distance from me , and behind me , and the Prisoner was the sole Person that was nigh me , and her Hands were about me . The other Person , who took my Handkerchief , was towards my left side , behind the Prisoner , who stood right before me , and her Hands were constantly about my Pockets . When I had got the Prisoner to the House where she carried me to look for her Accomplice , she desired me to search her , but I knew it was to no Purpose , because I believed she had handed it away to the other Woman behind her : but I ca n't say I saw her hand it away . It was a Gold Watch , and worth upwards of 10 £ . Prisoner . Was I in company with the other Woman ? Mr Millar . She was not standing with her at first . The other Woman was standing by her self , at the End of a court , and gave me a Pull by the Sleeve as I passed by ; and after she had stopped me , the Prisoner came up immediately . She was carried that Night to the Gatehouse , and the next Morning before a Magistrate , who committed her . Prisoner . As I was coming down the court , I met this Gentleman , running after a Woman ; he snatched hold of my Handkerchief and said I belonged to the Woman who had got his Gloves and Handkerchief . I told him I did not ; and desired him not to take my Handkerchief , but go with me to the House , where I saw the other Woman go in . Dorothy Churchman , had known the Prisoner about a Year , and deposed that she was Apprentice to a Truss-maker , and lodged with her in Fleet-Lane , that she always kept good Hours , and did not go out to pick Gentlemen up . Mary Arnold , gave an Account , that Mr Millar came with the Prisoner to her House in the court , and said he had lost his Watch ; and after he had secured the Prisoner , he took a candle , and search 'd about the court , and under a Stone which the Paviours had taken up to mend the Pipes : and that he did not say the Prisoner had it , but that they had got it among them ; and that it was a fault of his , Acquitted . 238 . + Daniel Stogdale was indicted for privately stealing a Silk Handkerchief , val . 4 s. from the Person of John Butler , April 7 .

Elizabeth Moreton , ( 13 Years of Age , the 21st of July next , ) after having been asked some Questions about the Nature of an Oath , was admonish 'd to speak nothing but what was Truth . The substance of the Account she gave was , that about Midsummer last she went to live with a Gentlewoman who then lodged in the House of Mr Henry in Mumford's-Court in Milk-Street . That one Morning her Mistress being gone to Market , and no one being left in the House but her , and the Prisoner , who was a Servant to Mr Henry ; He came up Stairs , and would have tempted her to have gone down Stairs into the cellar with him , but she refusing , he took hold of her , and forcibly carried her thither , tho ' she scratched his Face , and clung to the Bannisters of the Stairs . That when he had got her into the cellar he laid her down on the Ground ; and held her down by keeping one of his Hands on her Forehead . [ The Witness proceeded in her Account of the Prisoner 's abusing her , and of his Behaviour to her , but our Regard to Decency obliges us to veil it . ] She said , she cried out , Murder ! but he kept her down , and almost stifled her . That after this , she was very ill , and could hardly walk ; but was fearful to discover the Injury the Prisoner had done her left her Father and Mother should be at her . She was asked a Question , which in such unhappy cases the Law makes necessary , and she answered in the Negative . She farther deposed , that her Mother at last discovered her Illness , by her Linnen , and that upon her being examined by her Father , she told what the Prisoner had done , and that no one else but he had abused her : after which she was carried to the Hospital , where she continued three Weeks , in Order to be cured of the Foul Disease . Rochael Moreton , the Child 's Mother , deposed , that she had observed her for some Time to walk comically , but she thought her Shoes might hurt her Feet . At last she [ being frighted by the Appearance of her Linnen ] got her Husband to examine her ; and she then gave the same Account of the Cause of her Disorder , as she had now done . She added , that about a Fortnight before this Injury was found out , her youngest Child having been taken ill in the same Manner , she got Mr Markland , a Surgeon , to examine them both , and found they had got the Foul Disease upon them . Mr Markland depos 'd that he examin 'd the Children , and found the first Witness miserably clapp 'd . His Answers to some Questions did not amount to a Proof of the Fact , as charged in the Indictment ; but it was his Opinion , that a venereal Taint might be communicated by meer Contact , & c. which would produce the Disorder the Witness laboured under , without infecting the Blood . John Moreton 's Evidence was agreeable to that of his Wife . Simon Henry , the Prisoner 's Master , depos 'd , that the cellar where the Child pretended the Fact was done , was an open cellar , with a Window next the Court ; that the Prisoner had behaved well with him , and that no Maid who had lived with him , had complained of his Behaviour . It was his Opinion , that the Prisoner had not been disordered , as to his Health ; and that if the Girl had cry 'd out , she must have been heard , because the Court was a publick Thorough-fare . James Sample , a Surgeon in Behalf of the Prisoner , deposed , that he had examined the Prisoner and found him free from any Venereal Disorder , and that Mrs Moreton had refused to let him view her Children , with another Surgeon of her own chusing . The Jury desired the Girl might be asked , in what Part of the cellar the Fact was committed ? She deposed , it was done in that Part which was farthest from the Window . Elizabeth Bennet , and Molly Connolly , never had heard an unhandsome Word , or seen an uncivil thing from the Prisoner , in their Lives : they had washed his Linnen , and had never seen any Symptoms of his being disordered .
