James Russell and William White ; were arraign 'd for breaking ( with Timothy Dunn not taken ) the Dwelling-house of George Barkley , and stealing , thence 4 Gold Rings,2 Stuff Coats,6 Handkerchiefs,1 Sattin Gown , 1 Pair of Stays , 4 Guineas , and Several sorts of other rich Goods , on the 1st of April last ; and Deborah Stent as Accessory to the Fact , in receiving the same , knowing them to be stole . To all which Arraignments , White and Thurland refus 'd to plead , but stood obstinately without speaking or holding up their Hands ; upon Which the Court read the Law to them , by virtue of which their two Thumbs were tied together with Whipcord , and drawn by the whole Force of two Men , each above a Quarter of an Hour , which having no Effect upon their , contumacious Humour , Sentence was pass 'd upon on them to be press 'd to Death according to Law but when they saw Death so near and terrible they relax 'd , and pleaded Not Guilty to each Indictment . Then they challeng 'd all the old Jury , and a new one being sworn , the Jurors Names were , as followeth John Mills , Gent . John Brooks Joseph Oakly William Gunstone Edward Prior Jeremy Lewin John Toward Richard Winch Edward Barnet Joseph Winkle William Hughes Benjamin Chapman . Then they were all indicted as above ; and the Witnesses being called to the first and second indictments , Mr. Knapp swore , That a Gentleman who had made his Mother a Visit a few Days before , among other things in Conversation , was pleas 'd to express himself very well satisfied with the Diversion he met with at Sadler 's Wells ; upon which she , was very desirous to see it , and on the Evening which prov 'd so fatal they both went there together and perceiving his Mother inclin 'd to stay , he went to the Bar and ask 'd them if they could provide him a Link , which they did , and he and his Mother staid till 10 a Clock and then he lighted it , and went away with her without meeting any Accident till they came within 40 Yards of the Houses , where they first met a Soldier , who prov 'd 2 very honest Fellow , but they did not like him ; and in an Instant of Time his Link was blown out , his Hat and Wigg taken off , and he himself beat down to the Ground ; which made his Mother scream out , upon which one of them fir 'd a Pistol close by him , and immediately he heard his Mother say , Lord , help me , help me ; and then the Rogues fled . Then he went immediately to the Houses for Help , and the Soldier came to his Assistance , and having a Light , he found his Mother upon the Ground dead . This Evidence as far as it concern 'd the Action was confirm 'd by Isaac Ragg ( one of the Gang ) and the Soldier , but Ragg swore , That when they ( himself and the Prisoners ) came back to drink together , they all pull 'd out their Pistols , having each a Brace to examine , who had discharg 'd and they found that the Prisoner White had discharg 'd one of his ; and being ask 'd the Reason of it , he said he did it to frighten the Woman and make her hold , her Tongue , which she did immediately , Who confess 'd he shot the Woman to another ; but said he did not intend it , but only sir 'd to frighten her . This was done by Grass-Inn Garden-Wall . There were several others who saw Mrs. Knapp lie dead . The other Prisoners Thurland and Chapman were sworn by Ragg to be concern 'd in the Murder and Robbery , which neither of them could deny upon Trial . The Jury found them all Guilty of both Indictments . Then the Witnesses were sworn to the Indictment of the Assault and Robbery of Mr. Gough , committed by the aforesaid Prisoners ; and Mr. Gough depos 'd they robb 'd him ; between Holloway and the Half Way-House , took away his Horse and all his Cloths . That Thurland took his Breeches off ; That he was bound and thrown into a Field , without any thing to comfort him but Promises of more Company ; Which was also confirm 'd by Isaac Ragg , who swore , That White and Chapman , and two more ( Timothy Dunn and William Parker ) not taken , were concern 'd with him in the Fact . The Jury found them all Guilty of this Indictment . Then came on the Trial of Russel , White and Stent , for the Burglary in breaking the House of Mr. Barkley and receiving the stol'n Goods . Mr. Barkley depos 'd , his House was broke and the Goods , stole ; and Ragg swore he was concern 'd in it with the Prisoners and Timothy Dunn , That they watch 'd Mrs. Burkley 's going out with some Linnen . ( as she used to do about that Time ) to a Member of Parliament , and forc 'd open the Door ; That two said ( at the Door , while the other two went in and took away the Goods , which ) they sold to Stent , as they had done others several times before , using the Expression which they had stole for Her . There was a Chissel and a Bayonet left in the Room ; which Bayonet Mrs. Barkley was inform 'd by some Mark belong 'd to the First Regiment of Foot Guards , by which means and the help of a Serjeant , she discover 'd Russel , who discover 'd Stent , and her , House being Search 'd , some of the Prosecutor 's Goods were found there .
