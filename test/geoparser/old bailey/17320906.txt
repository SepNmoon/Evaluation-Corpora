Thomas Jeffries . My Brother and I are Partners in Trade in our House on Snow-hill , the Prisoner James was my Book-keeper , and David is his Brother . I took James into my Service on the 7th of January last , but about the end of June meeting with another Book keeper , who I thought was sitter for my Business , I gave James warning , and he was to leave my Service that Day I was robb 'd , which was Wednesday the 19th of July . I had left in a Bag 119 l. 19 s. and a bad Guinea in my Desk , besides a Snuff-Box , a Silver Watch , 2 Pair of Pistols , and 3 Gold Rings , and in my Parlour a Silver-hilted Sword . I saw them in those Places on Tuesday in the Afternoon , and when I came down Stairs next Morning , my Desk was broke open , the Money and Goods were gone , and the Prisoner James not to be found . I presently got Advertisements printed , and sent a Friend Post towards Harwich in pursuit of the Prisoners . My Friend left Advertisements at several Places as he rode along , by which means the Prisoners were taken at Chelmsford . William Swai . One of Mr. Joshua 's Advertisements being left at my Shop in Burst-wood , as soon as I had read it , I recollected that I had seen such a Man as was therein described , and another with him , pass by my Shop the same Morning . I took 2 of my Journeymen , and followed them to Brilerecay , which is 5 Miles . We heard such Men had been there , but could not meet with them , though I searched all the Alehouses in the Town ; we pursued them to Chelmsford , and at the Cock and Coach there we found them early next Morning . I read over the Advertisement to them , and bid James hold up his Head ( for they both held their Heads down ) that I might see if he answer 'd the Description ; then I told him that I believed he was the Person , he said that he was the Man that was Guilty of the Fact , and wished that he had never done it . We found upwards of 110 l. and a Brace of Pistols upon him , and another Brace of Pistols upon his Brother David , and this broken Silver-hilted Sword was taken out of a Bundle which David had in his Custody . Prisoner J . B . When you first came in was the Bundle in any Body 's Hands , or was it lying on the Table , you or not ? Swain . It was in David 's Lap , or under his Arm as he sat , and the Sword was taken out when we were before the Justice . J . B. was the Sword then in the same Situation [ Condition - was the Blade broken ] as it is now ? Swain . Yes . J . B . Were the Pistols loaded ? Swain . No Mr. Jeffries . This Sword was whole when I saw it last in the Parlour . Joseph Smith . My Master , Mr. Swain , took me with him to pursue the Prisoners . Hearing at Billericay that they were gone forward , we took Horses at Midnight , and followed them to Chelmsford , where we found 'em next Morning . When they saw us , they hung down their Heads ; says my Master to James , Hold up your Head , that I may see if you answer the Description in the Advertisement , I am afraid that you are the Men ; yes , answer 'd James , I am be indeed , and I wish I was not . I saw about 110 l. taken from James , and a Watch and a Snuff-box and 3 Gold Rings . When Mr. Jeffries came down , he asked James why he took the Pistols ? And James said , We were resolutely bent to lose our Lives rather than to be taken . J . B . No , I said the Pistols and Sword were taken not with a Design to hurt any Body , but only to strike Terror . D. E. Was not the Bundle from whence the Sword as taken lying on the Table when you came in ? Smith . No , I think you had the Bundle under your Arm . Swain . I and Smith went in together , David then had the bundle , I think it lay on his Lap , with his Arm on it thus - J . B . It lay on the Table , but when we were going before the Justice , they bid my Brother take it up and carry it , which he did , and so it came to be under his Arm . Francis nut , Constable . On Thursday the 20th of July , about 6 in the Morning . Mr. Swain , a Periwig maker of Burntwood , came to me with an Advertisement , and told me , that he had heard the Prisoners were at the Cock and Coach . I took Assistance , and went in first ; I looked in at the Door a Minute , and saw they were buying 2 Whips of a Sadler , and they said they had hired two Horse for Colchester . I told James I was come to take him up for robbing his Master , a Hair Merchant , on Snow-Hill . The Neighbours said , Take care , he has put Pistols . I demanded the Pistols , and he let me take them quietly , and seemed to be very much surprized ; says I , if you are not the Person you need not be afraid , for you can come to no harm ; I wish I was not , says he , but to show you that I am , I have all the Effects , and will produce them . Then he pulled out a handful of Gold , and some other things , the particulars of which I wrote down for my own Security ; there were eight Pieces of Foreign Gold of 3 l. 12 s. each , I piece of 5 Moidores , 2 pieces of 36 s. each , 1 double Guinea , 12 Moidores , and 45 Guineas . Mr. Jeffries . One of those Guineas was not good . J. Smith . 1 Spanish Pistole , 5 Broad Pieces of 23. each , half a Broad Piece of 11 s. 6 d. 2 Quarter Moidores , 3 Bank-Notes , 1 for 100 l. 1 for 50 l. and 1 for 40 l. Mr. Jeffries . I did not put those Notes in the Indictment . F. Smith . 1 Silver Watch , 1 Silver Snuff-Box with a spotted Shell , 3 Mourning Gold Rings , 1 pair of Pistols ; and all these Things he said were the Property of his Master Jeffries . My Assistant took another Pair of Pistols from David . Court . Who had the Bundle ? F. Smith . I ca n't say , it was either in David 's Lap , or lay by him . D. B . Did not you order me to take the Bundle and carry it before the Justice ? F. Smith . I do n't remember that I did . Nathaniel Stock . I assisted to take them ; they seemed much concerned . When I went in first the Bundle was on David 's Knees , but he preseurly laid it on the Table . I saw the Money and Goods taken from James , and a pair of Pistols from David . Court . You hear the Charge , Prisoners ; What have you to say in your Defence ? J . B . 'T is easy , my Lord , for a Man who knows his own Innocence to find Words to defend himself ; but how difficult a Task is this for one who , like me , is loaded with Guilt ? One who is sensible of having committed a Crime of so high a Nature against two kind and generous Masters . Yet I hope there are some Circumstances of Alleviation to be found . I will appeal to my Master himself , if I have not , during the time I have been in his Service , behaved myself with Honesty and Integrity in all Thing , except in this one unhappy Instance . 'T is not possible to declare with what a Compulsion on my own Mind I committed this Fact , and what Strugglings I felt in my Soul before I was overcome and yielded to the Temptation . My Master having told me , that he had provided himself with another Book-keeper , I applied to the Honourable John Drummond , by whose Means I was recommended as a Book-keeper to Mr. Woodny , a Scotch Factor . Mr. Woodny requir 'd 200 l. Security ; my Master Jeffries said he would give me a Character , but would not be bound for any Man ; and I having no Friend in London that I could be so free with , as to desire him to be bound for me , I lost Mr. Woodny 's Place , and had no Prospect of any other Service . Then it was that the base Thought of wronging my Master enter 'd my Soul . Poverty and Want appear 'd frightful to my Imagination , and raised a Multitude of false Reasonings and Suggestions , which at length prevailed over me ; Words can not express the Terrors that attended my Guilt . How often was I upon the point of returning to my Master , but the Dread of Shame still prevented me , and hurried me on to my Ruin ! When the Persons who took us entered the Room , we made no Resistance , but peaceably surrendered our selves to Justice , and I readily delivered up every thing that I had wrongfully taken . As for my Brother I hope he will not suffer for my Crime , which he was ignorant of . D. B. I call 'd on my Brother the Day before we went away together , and he desired me to take a Walk with him in the Country next Morning , and I accordingly met him about 5 o'Clock , for I was out of Place , and my Time was at my own Disposal . He gave me a pair of Pistols , and a Bundle to carry for him ; but he did not tell me how he came by them , nor did I know any thing of the Fact . Court . Was the Sword put up in that Bundle so as not to be seen ? Swain . Yes ; it was a Bundle of soul Linen ; there were 5 or 6 Shirts in it , and the Sword-blade was broke off pretty short . The Jury acquitted David , and found James guilty . Death . 3. Faith Brown was indicted for stealing 2 Sheets , the Goods of John Mandevile , July 3 . Acquitted . 4.

Elizabeth Hobbs of Shoreditch , was indicted for stealing 1 Broad Piece , 2 Guineas , a half Guineas , and 44 s. the Money of Philip Sparks , in the House of Edw Fuller , July 7 . Philip Sparks . My Mother lodged in Mr. Fuller 's House , and so did the Prisoner ; the Money was in a Box under my Mother 's Bed , it was told in there on the Wednesday Night , and miss 'd on the Friday following , and the Prisoner coming often to the House to see her Mother , was suspected , and being examined she confess 'd and sign 'd her Confession before the Justice , which was read in Court . The Jury found her Guilty to the Value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 15.

The Prisoner was the Prosecutor 's Servant ; the Goods being miss 'd , she was examined , and confessed where she had pawned them . The Jury found her Guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 16. Joseph Powis was indicted for breaking and entering the House of Joseph Brewer , in the Parish of St. Andrew Holbourn , with an Intent to steal his Goods , about the Hour of 2 in the Night , on the 3d of August last . Joseph Brewer . I keep the Raven Alehouse in Fetter-Lane ; I have a Cellar Window next the Street , with two folding Doors and a Flap , I open those Doors and take up the Flap or Plank to let down my Drink ; and at those Doors you may either go directly into the Cellar or the Ground-floor , and so all over the House . On the Ground-floor I have likewise a Back-door which goes into my Yard , which is parted by a low Wall from my Neighbour Mr. Ashley 's [ Astly ] Yard . The Prisoner was drinking at my House between 11 and 12 on the Night before it was broke open . When he was gone I made fast all my Doors and went to bed , and between 2 and 3 next Morning , the Watch call 'd me up , and told me my Cellar-door was broke open . We search 'd my House without finding the Thief , but then seeing the Back-door open we went into Mr. Ashley 's Yard , and found the Prisoner under a Dresser in a Shed . We examin 'd his Pockets , and took out these 2 Spikes , all these Picklock-Keys , this Wax-Candle , this Lancet , which he said was to let People Blood , and this Iron-pin , which is the Pin of my Cellar-Window . He is a Locksmith by Trade , and was cast last March was a Twelvemonth for Transportation ; but his Father who lives in good Credit , made Friends that he might have his Punishment here . Prisoner . I have made several Pins ; is there any Mark upon this Pin that you can swear it to be yours ? Brewer . I know it to be mine ; it fits the Key and the Iron-bar of my Window ; I am sure I put it in over-night and key 'd it , and it was not there in the Morning , when I found my Cellar-door open . Prisoner . But has it no particular Mark that you know it by ? For one Pin may be like another . Brewer . I know this , that after it was found upon you , you said , Now I am a dead Man . And when I came to look on my Till , I found by several Marks that there had been an Attempt to break it open . John Graham . Hearing an Outcry of Thieves between 2 and 3 in the Morning , I got out of Bed and came down Stairs , and found the Prisoner in Mr. Ashley 's Yard . Court . Was it dark then ? Graham . Yes . Court . Was there not Day-light enough to distinguish a Man 's Countenance ? Graham No . Court . How then do you know that the Prisoner is the Man who was taken in Ashley 's Yard ? Graham . The People brought Candles ; some of them had got Spits , and run him into the Leg , upon which he cry 'd out , For God 's Sake do n't use me thus , and I 'll surrender myself . I told him I thought they had not hurt him much . Yes , but they have , says he , so much , that I believe I shall not be able to walk to the Watch-house ; but I wish I may die of my Wounds before I come to be try 'd , for my poor Father 's Sake , because I have requited him so ill for his Kindness in getting me off from Transportion . I took these Scissars and this Pin of the Window out of his Pocket . Court . Did you hear him say any thing about that Pin when you took it from him ? Graham . I do n't remember that I did ; but when he was before Sir William Billers , the Alderman ask 'd him what was the Use of this Lancet ? and he answer 'd very audaciously , that it was to let People Blood in the Night . After he was sent to the Compter , I ask 'd him if he had any Accomplices ? and he said , No , I acted by my self , and I desire to suffer by my self . Prisoner to the Prosecutor . Who was present when the Pin was found ? Who heard me say that I was a dead Man ? Prosecutor . You did not say those Words the Minute the Pin was taken upon you , but it was when you was brought into Mr. Dighten 's House , and he was present ; but he is not here now . Robert Lugg , Watchman . When I beat one a Clock all was safe at Mr . Brewer 's House ; but when I went past two , I preserv 'd [ observ 'd ] the Iron-bar of his Cellar-Window was down , and the Pin was out . I call 'd Mr . Brewer up , and he bid me stand and watch at the Window till he came down . I suppose the Prisoner heard him , and so got out backwards in the mean time ; but we found him in Mr. Ashley 's Yard . William T. I went to the Prisoner in Newgate , 3 Days after he was committed , and ask 'd him how he could commit such erroneous Crimes , and he said that nothing vex 'd him so much , as that he had not Presence of Mind to throw the Pin out of his Pocket before he was taken ; for nothing had so great an Effect upon him as their finding that Pin . He felt such a sudden Damp , he said , that he thought he was struck with Death . Charles Astly . I heard an Out-cry of Thieves , and looking out at the Window , I saw the Prisoner come along my Mother 's Yard , and go to the Shed . I call 'd out to my Neighbours , and said the Thief was in our Yard ; and there I saw him taken , as he was under a Dresser with a Board put before him . I saw the Pin taken out of his Pocket . Court . Did he say any thing upon finding the Pin ? Astly . Not that I know of . Court . Could the Prisoner come any other Way into your Yard than over the Prosecutor 's Wall ? Astly . No , for none of our Doors were open . Prisoner . I was drinking at the Prosecutor 's House over Night , and going away about 12 , very much fuddled , I met a Woman by Mr. Astley 's Door , and somebody coming along while I was talking to her , she desir 'd me to go backwards into the Yard . The Prosecutor is one of a spiteful , malicious Character , and he was said to be concern 'd in concealing Mr. Hossel , who was try 'd for stealing Bank Notes . As for the Things that were found upon me , they are all Materials that I use in my Trade as a Locksmith . Court . Did you use the Lancet in that way too ? Prisoner . No , I used that as a Surgeon ; for I studied Blooding , and some other Parts of Surgery , as well as making Locks . When I was carried before Sir William Billers , he ask 'd me if I had not robb 'd a Kinsman of his ? I told him No ; and then , says he , to the Prosecutor , if you can hang him , there 's 40 l. for you . The Jury found him guilty . Death . 17. James Lewis of St. Mary le Bow , was indicted for forging and causing to be forged ( after the 29th of June 1729 ) a certain Writing , call 'd the Last Will and Testament of John Ward , with an Intent to defraud Mary Ward his Wife of his Wages , and for publishing the said Will , knowing it to be forged , August 20 . The Council for the King opened , that the Prisoner was one who frequently lent Money to Sailors ; that 't is customary for the Sailors to make a Will to the Person of whom they borrow Money . That the deceas 'd John Ward , having enter 'd himself on board the Bridgewater , in Service of the East-India Company , did really make a Will to the Prisoner , sign 'd Nov. 30 . 1726 . That the said John Ward returning safe from this Voyage , did go a second Voyage for the East-Indies , in the Ship Forbidge , Richard Gosprit Master , in which Voyage the said John Ward dy 'd . That the Prisoner hearing of his Death went to his Widow Mary Ward , to know if the Deceas 'd had made any Will , and finding that he had not , and that she intended to administer ; that then the Prisoner published this second Will , as the true Will of John Ward , sign 'd on the 30th of Nov. 1728 , and witnessed by Newton Robinson , and Mary Macafy , who were Witnesses to the first Will . That this second Will being the same in all Respects as the first , except in the Date of the Year , and that in the first it is mentioned , that John Ward was then a Sailor on board the Bridgewater ; but in the second , the Word Bridgewater seems to be eras 'd , and these Words are interlin 'd in a different Hand and Ink , Now belonging to the Ship Forbidge , Richard Gosprit Master . That the Prosecutor will endeavour to prove that this pretended second Will is no other than the first Will alter 'd in the Date and the Ship 's Name ; and that on November 30 . 1728 , when this second Will was said to be sign 'd in London by the deceas 'd John Ward , he was then down at Gravesend , receiving his River-pay ; and that therefore it is done without the Knowledge of the said John Ward , and is false and forged . John Hawkins . This is the original Will of John Ward , I brought it from the Perogative-Office . I am Clerk to the Register . It has been pleaded in Behalf of one James Lewis . [ Then the Will was read in Court , and it agreed with the Copy of it in the Indictment . ] Joseph Was . I was employ 'd by the Widow of the deceas 'd John Ward to receive the Wages due to him , but the Prisoner came with this Will , and the Probat , and got the Money from me . Council . Here Mrs. Robinson , did you know John Ward ? Newton Robinson . Yes . Council . Look on that Paper ; what is it ? Robinson . 'T is the Will of John Ward . Council . Did you see him execute it ? Robinson . Yes . I sign 'd my Name . Here it is as a Witness . Council . Where ? Robinson . At the Prisoner 's House in Queen's-Head Alley , in Wapping . Council . How long ago ? Robinson . About 4 Years . Council . Are you sure 't was but 4 Years ago ? What Ship did John Ward then belong to ? Robinson . The Forbidge . Court . Why this proves the second Will . Council . Here , Mary Macafy ; Is that your Mark ? Macafy . Yes . Council . Who Signed that Will ? Macafy . I saw one they called John Ward sign it , but I did not know him . Council . Where ? Macafy . At the Prisoner 's House . Council . When ? Macafy . About 4 Years ago . Court . Have you any more such Witnesses ? Council . We have some to prove that John Ward was several Miles from London , at the Time that the second Will is said to be Signed . John Philpot . The deceased John Ward was my Son-in-Law , he ow 'd me Money , and I threatned to Trouble him , which made him afraid to come on Shore , and so he kept on Board . Court . When was this ? Philpot . I do n't know the Time . Court . Then you might as well have said nothing . - Barns . I live at the Flying-Horse at Gravesend ; and that Day as John Ward received his River-Pay for the Forbidge he was at our House , and lay there that Night . It was the - [ He pauses , and Joseph Wass prompts him ] the 30th of November , 1728 . Court . And how came you to remember so exactly , that it was the 30th Day ? Have you any particular Reason for it ? Might it not have been on the 28th ? Barns . I remember it was the last Day of the Month . Joseph Wass . Remember the Day of the Month the 30th of November [ aside to Ann Rogers ] . Ann Rogers . I live at the Flying Horse at Gravesend . John Ward used our House . I remember the River-Pay of the Ship Forbidge was paid there the 30th of November ; and Ward and his Wife both lay there that Night . Officer . My Lord , here 's this Man , Joseph Wass , prompts the Witnesses . A Gentleman . Yes , my Lord , I heard him too . Court . Swear those two Persons . [ Th sworn . ] Now what did you hear him say ? Officer . He bid them remember the Day of the Month , and he named some Day , but I forget what Day it was . Gentleman . I heard him say , Remember the 30th of November . J. Wass . Suppose I did , I hope there was no Harm in that . Court . No harm , Sir ? When a Man 's Life is at Stake , are you to put Words in the Witnesses Mouths , and direct them what to swear ? Officer take him into Custody . Wass . My Lord - Court . Take him away to Newgate . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and the Court order 'd him to have a Copy of his Indictment . 18. Elizabeth Thorn was indicted for marrying John Green on the 9th of July , in the Second Year of his present Majesty , in the Parish of St. Mary Magdalen Old Fish-street , her former Husband , John Howell , to whom she was married on the 25th of Feb. in the 7th Year of King George I. in the Parish of St . Brides , being then living . Margaret Farley . I saw the Prisoner and my Cousin John Howell married in the Fleet , on the 25th of Feb. 10 Years ago . He was an Apprentice , and she a Servant in the same House ; but they did not live together as Man and Wife , and I believe he never bedded her . Edward Langdon . On the 4th of July last I saw John Howell alive in Hertfordshire , and the Prisoner married her second Husband as a Widow , by the Name of Howell . John Green . I was married to the Prisoner July 9 . 1729. at St. Mary Magdalen 's Old Fish-street , but I do n't know the Parson 's Name , I was an Apprentice at that Time . She had a little Estate , and when I went to demand a Quarter 's Rent of her Brother , he told me I should have none , for her Husband Howell was alive . Prisoner . Here , you Husband , this is your nown Child . do n't you know it ? You are my lawful Husband , tho ' I was married to John Howell , and you have got another Wife . You know that I was never bedded by John Howell , and therefore he 's no Husband to me . I had 20 l. a Year , and I sold 5 of it in your Name , and for your Use , and you had the Money ; and now because my Brother wo n't let you have any more of it , you want to turn me off . But you are my lawful Husband , I say , and I never knew any Man but you . John Green . How can that be , when I received 10 l. on Account of a Bastard-Child that you had before I married you ? The Jury acquitted her . 19 . * Peter Bell was indicted for privatly stealing 6 l. 6 s. from the Person of Ann Wall , the Money of her Husband Joseph Wall , in the Parish of Christ-church , July 8 . * See the Tryal of Peter Bell in the Sessions-Paper , No . 1 . P. 4 . Ann Wall . As I was buying a Peck of Peas in Newgate-market , on the last Day of last Sessions , I saw the Prisoner 's Hand in my Pocket .

I seized him directly . One of his Hands was shut . I made him open it , and I saw the Money drop out of his Hand . There was 7 s. and 6 d. 3 Farthings . I asked him whose Money it was ? He said he did not know , for it was none of his . Ann Wall . I miss 'd but 6 s. 6 d. 3 Farthings . Spencel . I am sure he dropt 7 s. 6 d. 3 Farthings ; for there were 2 Half-Crowns , 2 s. a Sixpence , and 3 Farthings . The Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . Death . 20.

On Sunday-Noon I locked my Pocket-Book with the Notes , in my Bureau , which stands in my Chambers at No . 15. in Clifford 's Inn , and went to Dine with the Dean of Durham at Chelsea , as I usually do on Sundays , when he 's there . I returned from thence with Mr. Gray , the Dean 's Brother , about 8 in the Evening , and when I came Home I found my Laundress waiting for me in the Gardens . She told me that when she came to my Chambers , she found the Door open , and the Drawers of my Bureau lying on the Floor ; that she acquainted her Sister with it , who advised her to leave every thing as it was , and lock the Door , and that she did so accordingly . In this Condition I found my Room ; my Drawers were tumbled , and my Pocket-book with all the Notes gone . I advertis 'd 'em , with a Reward for whoever brought 'em to Mr. Richard Morson , Banker in Lombard-street . On the 8th of August , about 2 in the Afternoon , Mr. John Graham came to me at the Custom-house , I am an Attorney , says he , in Red-lion-Court in Cursitor 's Alley ; my Man has told me , that Ann Foster , a Woman of the Town , has got such a Pocket-case , with such Notes as you have advertised . His Man at tended at the Door . I went to him , and he told me that the Pocket-Case had the King's-Arms and City Arms upon it . I asked him how he found me out ? He said , by Letters in the Case , directed for Evan Hughs , at his Seat in the Long-Room in the Custom-House . I got a Warrant from Justice Giffard , and I went with Mr. Graham to the Rummer and Horse-shoe Tavern in Drury-lane , and sent for her . I told her I had lost a Pocket-Case with Notes in it . She said , she had found such a one . Graham said , he saw a Constable in the Street , whom she called Broadon P , and charged him with her . Says she , do n't walk with me in Publick , but let me go and I 'll fetch 'em . I was not willing to trust her , and so we followed her close to her Lodgings . There she told us , they were upon the Bed 's Tester , and we found 'em accordingly . She said , she found 'em on a Bench in Gray's-Inn-Walks , on Wednesday the 8th of August . James Warner . I was at Mrs . Hides , in Charles-street , Covent-Garden ; the Prisoner came in there , and look 'd very merry . I asked the Reason ; she said she had Reason enough , for she had found that in Gray's-Inn Walks that would make her merry ; but she did not then tell me what it was ; but when she went to Bed - I did not go to Bed with her - I and the Landlady searched her Pockets , and found the Pocket-Case and Notes in it . Eliz Hansor . That Day was Sev'n-night before the Prisoner was taken up , she came into my Coffee-House , and in the Publick Room shewed the Case and Notes , and said she had found them in Gray's-Inn Walks . A Gentleman there look 'd on the Notes , and said , These are of Value to the Owner , but of none to you ; and so he sealed them up . Mrs . Hide . The Prisoner breakfasted with me , and complaining of the Head-ach , she said , she 'd go out , and take a Walk . When she came Home , she said she had found a Pocket-Case and Notes , and that she had shewn 'em at Mrs. Hanson 's , and then she shewed it to me . Mr. Warner reckon 'd the Notes up to 300 l. The Jury acquitted her . 21. Elizabeth Pardoe was indicted for stealing 6 l. the Money of John Davil , in his House , in the Parish of St. Sepulchres , Sept. 2 . Eliz Davil . I took the Prisoner into my Service this Day was Sev'n-night . I have 2 other Girls , but I would not let her lye with them , for fear they should spoil her . I keep a Victualling House , and take a Porringers of Silver in a Day , during the Time of Bartholomew Fair . I had put one Pint Porringer with 12 l. and a Paper with 6 l. into my Drawers . I called her up Stairs , to give me a clean Pair of Rolls out of my Drawers , to roll my Legs , for you must know I am pretty weighty , and my Legs are apt to swell . As soon as she had given me the Rolls , my Cook called out , Come down ye Bitch , and pare the Turmips . So down she went , and my Son came up , and the Drawers being open , he saw they had been cut . I was afraid I had lost all my Money ; however , the Pint Porringer was safe , but the 6 l. in the Paper was gone ; and by and by she came up again to lace my Scays . I told her the Paper was missing . Lord , bless me , says she , I wonder who could do it ; but at last , upon examining her closely , she confess 'd that she had taken it , and given it to a young Fellow , who persuaded her to it . She said he pulled out a Knife and swore he would kill her , if she did not get my Money for him ; and that when she had given it to him , he said , Ye Bitch , this will serve me but a Fortnight . We took the Fellow up , but he brought several to his Reputation , and so they cleared him . Philip Price . As the Prisoner was going to the Compter , she owned to me , that she took the Money , and that there was a Moidore and a Guinea , and the rest in Silver .

A Girl told me that she saw a Creature in the Yard with a Bundle , and asked her what she did there ? And the Creature said , What 's that to you , ye Bitch , or some such Words . The Girl shew 'd us which Way she went , and we follow 'd , and found her in Long-lane . Mary Pagl . I sell Old-Cloaths . The Prisoner asked me if I 'd buy any old Gowns ; and with that she threw down a Bundle with these 4 rich Gowns in it , and these laced Head-cloths and Ruffles . She asked 3 s. 6 d. for the Head , and 2 d. for the Russels . I told her , I was afraid she did not come honestly by them , and then stepping out to call a Neighbour , she run down Seacoal-lane .

Ann Bush . I keep the Man-in-the-Moon Alehouse , in Ironmonger Row . The Prisoner was Quartered at my House , and behaved himself very civilly , so that I trusted him to draw Drink . The Deceased was Quarter 'd at the next Alehouse , and on the 8th of June , between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , he came drunk to my House , and called for a Pint of Beer . The Prisoner at first refused to draw him any , but at last let him have 3 Pints , one after another . The Deceased then grew extreamly troublesome , upon which the Prisoner desired him to go out ; but the Deceased swore that he would not . The Prisoner endeavour 'd to carry him out ; upon which they struggled together , and the Deceased beat the Prisoner violently . The Prisoner went into his own Room ; the Deceased follow 'd him , but we pull 'd him back , and got him out of Door , and shut it upon him . He staid there damning his Blood , and would not be persuaded to go away . Then the Prisoner came down with his Sword drawn , and got out of the Window to the Deceased . I was frighted , and turned away , so that I did not see any thing farther done . Robert Griffith . The Deceased being very troublesome , the Prisoner endeavour 'd to get him out . They struggled in the Entry , and fought , the Prisoner 's Coat was torn ; the Deceased beat him , and dragg 'd him about the House . The Prisoner got up Stairs , and staid some Time , in the mean while we got the Deceased out . Then the Prisoner came down with a drawn Sword , and went to the Door , and pass 'd at the Deceased . We got the Prisoner in again , and shut the Door , and then he got out o'th ' Window , and struck the Deceased on the Head , with his Sword . The Deceased fell down , and the Prisoner upon him , for the Deceased had hold of the Prisoner 's Hair , and pull 'd him down . At last he let go his Hold , got up went a little Way , and fell down again . He was afterwards sent to the Hospital , where his Hand was cut off , and he died . John Clark . The Deceased was very Rusoulous , and so the Prisoner gave him a Cut over the Head ; and that 's all as I know of the Matter . The Jury acquitted him . 24.

William Saint . The Prisoner was my Servant . On the 9th of July he ran away from me at Sheerness , and took my Boat with him . While I and my Wife were at Ghent in Flanders , I received a Letter from Thomas Riddle ( who I left in my House in St. Catherines ) informing me that my House had been robb 'd by my Man Harry . I took a Post-Chaise to Dunkirk , and from thence sent my Wife Home in a Vessel before me . When I came Home , he owned to me in New-Prison , that he got upon the House by the help of 2 Poles , and so into the Garret-window on the Saturday-night ; that he was in the House 20 Hours ; that ( when Riddle went out on Sunday-morning ) he went into every Room of the House , and ransackled all the Drawers , and that he had really broke 14 or 15 Locks . Thomas Riddle . As I was smoaking my Pipe about 9 o'Clock o ' Sunday-night , at a Neighbour 's House , some of Madam Saint 's Neighbours sent me Word , that the Street-door was open , and Captain Saint had sent me a Letter before , that his Man Harry was run away . So I thought it was Harry 's doings ; and upon searching the House , I found his Hat in the Garret , and a Hammer and Gimblet under the Bed-Quilt up one Pair of Stairs . The Garret-door was broke open , and 2 Panes taken out of the Garret-window . The Prisoner was taken next Day by a Young Man , who brought him to Mr. Cooper 's over against Capt . Saint 's House . He confess 'd that he got up to the Garret-window by 2 Poles , and then sot a Top of the House till his Companion came up , and took out 2 Panes of Glass out of the Garret-Window , and so open 'd it and got in . That the Fellow , his Companion , staid half an Hour in the House , and then went down the same way as he came ; but that he himself got in about 10 or 11 at Night , and lay there till next Day . We found this Pocket-Piece , and Pocket-Bottle upon him , which he said he took out of the Desk ; this Hat out of the Closet ; and this Purse with a Silver Scissars-Chain ; these Girdles and Buckles out of the Drawers ; and so I sont the Captain Word of what had happen 'd . Mary Saint . I was in Flanders with Mr. Saint , when , Riddle sent me Word that my Man had broke open my House , and stole my Goods . This is my Stone Buttle , and my Silver Girdle ; they were in my Drawers in my Fore-Room , and this is my Purse , and all the Things that are in it are mine , and they were taken out of my Drawers in my Back-Room . The Jury acquitted him of the Burglary , and found him guilty of Felony only , to the Value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 25. William Rogers was indicted for the Murder of Elizabeth Loveday , by throwing her against a Chair , by which Means she receiv 'd one mortal Bruise on her Breast , of which she instantly dy 'd , July 15 . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for Manslaughter . Rachel Wallis . As the Prisoner 's Child , about 12 Years old , was coming up Stairs , the Deceas 'd , who was the Prisoner 's Servant , swept the Dust in her Eyes : The Child ask 'd her why she did so ? and the Deceas 'd call 'd her impudent saucy Slut , and said it was her Pleasure to do so , and she would do it again . The Prisoner then came in , and ask 'd what was the Matter ? and the Child told him . The Prisoner bid the Deceas 'd go out of his House , she said she would not , and call 'd him Names , and was very abusive : With that , he took her by the Arm to lead her out ; she struggled , and being in Liquor , hit her Foot against the Door , fell with her Breast upon a low Chair , and from thence with her Head against the Grates . She got up again , and said she had hurt herself sadly ; she turn 'd pale . The Prisoner sent immediately for a Surgeon , who let her Blood , but she dy 'd in half an Hour . She would frequently be drunk , and pretend to be in Fits to fright us . Miss Rogers . The Deceas 'd sent me down Stairs for a Chair and a Shovel ; and as I was coming up with them , she swept the Dust in my Eyes . Pray do n't sweep it in my Eyes , says I ; but I will , says she , because it 's my Pleasure . Then I 'll tell my Father , says I , for you know he wont suffer such Things ; if we do any thing amiss , you ought to acquaint him with it , and he 'll correct us . I do n't care a Pin for you nor your Father neither , says she . And then my Father came in , and ask 'd what was the Matter ? and I told him . This is always the Trade , says my Father , when I am cut of the Way ; you can never let the Children alone . She said she would do so again if she had a mind to it . My Father told her , then she should not stay in his House any longer . But she would , she said , and gave my Father a great many ill Words ; and so my Father took her by the Arm to lead her out . She was very full of Liquor , and stagger 'd much ; her Foot hitch 'd against the Door , and she fell with her Stomach against the Chair , and then with her Temple against the Grate . John Froster , Surgeon . I found the Deceas 'd sitting on her Backside , with her Head leaning betwixt the Prisoner 's Knees ; I let her Blood , she bled freely about an Ounce and an half , and then flag 'd . I told him she was dead , and she dy 'd presently . I saw a Bruise on one side of her Head . John Kirkpatrick . The Deceas 'd had a small Fracture in her Scull , and her Breast-bone was a little depress 'd , which might suffocate the Lungs so that she could not breathe , for a little Matter will do it . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and found that Elizabeth Loveday dy 'd accidentally . 26. Francis Walford was indicted for the Murder of William Stanley , by abetting , aiding , comforting and maintaining Thomas Darby ( not yet taken ) who with a Shovel made of Iron and Wood , did strike the said William Stanley on the right part of the Head , and thereby gave him one mortal Bruise , on the 7th of July last , of which mortal Bruise he languish 'd till the 9th of August following , and then d 'd . Susannah Bragnall . I live in Elmstreet in Grays-Inn-Lane , next Door to where the Deceas 'd liv 'd . The Deceas 'd and his Wife were standing at their Door and I at mine , about 9 at Night . Thomas Darby ( who since escap 'd from the Constable ) and the Prisoner were both Labourers to Mr. Aldridge the Bricklayer , who was rebuilding a House just by . The Labourers sat up their Screen before the Deceas'd 's Door , to screen some Rubbish ; says the Deceas 'd , I hope you wo n't screen your Rubbish upon my Ground . Damn you for a Son of a Bitch , but we will , said the Labourers . The Deceas 'd went in , and then said his Wife , It 's hard that we ca n't stand at our own Door to take a mouthful of Air , but we must be choaked with your Dust . Damn you , you Bitch , said they , go in and send your Buck cut , and we 'll thrash him . With that the Deceas 'd came out , and kick 'd their Screen down ; and they set it up again nearer his Door than before , and begun to screen their Rubbish , which made such a Dust that I ran up to shut my Window , and in the mean time the Blow was given ; so that I did not see how it happen 'd . When I came down the Deceas 'd was very bloody , and his Wife came out with a Candle in her Hand , and went to a Neighbour 's House , and coming out again presently , she said , You Villain , you told me it was past 11 , and it is but half an Hour past 9 , for I have been to my Neighbour 's Clock to see . Says the Prisoner , Damn your Blood , you black Bitch , go in and send your Husband out again , and I 'll lick him again to his Heart 's Content . George Fleming . The Labourers gave gross Language to the Deceas 'd and his Wife . He kick 'd their Screen down ; they set it up again higher to his Door , and made a great Dust . I went up to shut our Window , and looking out , saw Thomas Darby strike the Deceas 'd on the Head with a Spade Edgeways , upon which the Deceas 'd said , Fetch a Constable , he has cut me down the Head . Thomas Paskin . There being a great Mob , I went to see what was the Matter , and heard the Prisoner say , If he had used me as he did Tom Darby , I would have serv 'd him as bad or worse . John Stanly . I am a Namesake , but no Relation to the Deceas 'd . I came home about 11 at Night ; Aye , says my Wife , you stay out till a fine time of Night ; here your Neighbour has been murder 'd . Mr. Sadler , Surgeon . Coming home on July 7. about 10 at Night , I found the Deceas 'd in my Surgery . He had a Wound in the upper-part of his Head to the Scull , but without any bad Symptoms of Vomiting , & c. In 6 or 7 Weeks the Wound was near healed ; and then he omitted coming to be drest for 2 or 3 Days . I enquir 'd the Reason of it , and was told , that he was a little Melancholy , which I did not like ; but his Friend said , he believ 'd it only proceeded from his being frighted at hearing me talk of an Exsoliatim , which he thought was something terrible to be done to him . I assured his Friend that it was only a slight Operation , and shew 'd him the Nature of it , and that it might come off with a Plaister ; but still the Deceas 'd was afraid to come . In a few Days I went to him , and found he was better , and therefore only advis 'd him to keep on the Plaister . On the 8th of August Word was sent me that he had had a it ; I thought a bad Symptom , and advis 'd that a Physician might be sent for . I propos 'd a Trefining , that is , opening the Scull , but his Friends were all against it . However , I sent for another Surgeon , but he could not come , and the Deceas 'd dy 'd about 4 next Morning . I open 'd his Scull , and found the Membranes of the Brain inflamed . I made an Incision in the Brain , and discharg 'd a quantity of faetid corrupted Matter , which is generally occasion 'd by a Shock or Blow of something heavy and which I thought was the Cause of his Melancholy . Court . If he had come regularly to have been drest , do you think that his Death might not probably have been prevented ? Mr. Sadler . I doubt it ; I think all the Chance we had for saving his Life would have been to have open 'd his Scull sooner . Dr. Smithson . On the 8th of August , I heard the Deceas 'd had had a sort of a Fit ; I found him stupid , dull , and almost senseless . Trefining ( or as the old Term is , Trepaning ) was propos 'd , but his Mother said , She had rather he should die quietly than go thro ' that barbarous Operation . As this would not be suffer 'd , I fear 'd he was past Relief , except a brisk Purge had a good Effect . I try 'd it ; it work 'd till 11 at Night , and then ceas 'd . He had Convulsions at One in the Morning , and lay rubbing the left side of his Forehead ; says I , there lies his Hurt , and you 'll find it under the Membranes of the Brain . Another Surgeon was sent for , but he could not come till 7 in the Morning , and the Deceas 'd dy 'd at 4 . A Piece of his Scull being taken off , we found an Inflamation on the Membranes of the Brain . The Surgeon thrust his Instrument in , opposite to the Wound , and there issued a great deal of yellow corrupted Matter , which was the Consequence of the Blow , and the Cause of his Death . Prisoner . The Deceas 'd came out and struck Darby 2 or 3 times . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 27 , 28. Charles Patrick and William Meads , were indicted for assaulting Joseph Andrews in a Field or open Place , near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , Value 5 l. a pair of Silver Buckles , Value 16 s. a Hat , Value 10 s. a Pocket Looking-glass , Value 6 s. a Silver Knee Buckle , Value 3 s. 2 Pieces of Foreign Silver , Value 1 s. 6 d. a Cotton Handkerchief , Value 1 s. and 17 s. 6 d. in Money , in the Parish of St. Mary le Bon , July 2 . They were a second time Indicted for assaulting Mary Cooling on the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Mother-of Pearl Snuff-Box , with a Silver Rim , Value 10 s. a Steel Toothpick-Case , Value 6 d. a Silver Toothpick , Value 6 d. and a Fan , Value 1 s. in the Parish of St. Mary le Bon , July 10 . First Indictment . The Prosecutor being a Frenchman , a Gentleman was sworn to interpret betwixt him and the Prisoners . Joseph Andrews . On the 2d of July , between 9 and 10 Night , I was attack 'd near the Bason in Marybon-fields by 4 Lads , but I can not swear to any of them ; one of them , who was a little one in a white Frock , held a Pistol to my Head , and push 'd it against my Forehead . I could not understand what they said ; but I cry 'd , O my God ! O my Dear ! Then the other three fell upon me , and the little one beat me on the Head with the Pistol , and they all got about me , and pull 'd me on the Ground . They took off my Shoe-buckles , took away my Hat , my Watch , my Pocket Looking-glass , my Handkerchief , 6 s. 6 d. and 2 French Pieces of Silver , one of 24 Sols , and one of 12 Sols , and then were going away ; but just as I was getting up , one of them came back and took one of my Knee Buckles , thinking it had been Silver , and then gave me 2 or 3 Knocks on the Face , and so left me , and I went home . After this , one Kirk , a Bailiff , came to my House , and ask 'd me if I had not been robb 'd at such a time ? I said , Yes . And did not you lose a Watch ? said he ; I told him , Yes . He shewed me a Watch , and ask 'd me if that was mine ? And I said , Yes ; and then he told me , that he fetch 'd it out of pawn . Kirk . I ask 'd the Prosecutor if he knew the Marks of his Watch ? And he describ 'd it to me , and said the Maker 's Name was Lugg , and he shew 'd me a Piece of String that match 'd with the String of the Watch . Sutton told me of the robbing this Man in Marybon-fields , and by Sutton 's Information I found this Watch at the Rose in Stanhope-street , where it was pawn 'd for 38 s. which I paid , and took it out . George Sutton . I and Wils Booth , and the 2 Prisoners robb 'd the Prosecutor near the new Bason in Marybon-fields , of a Watch , a pair of Shoe-Buckles , a Knee-Buckle , a Pocket-Glass , a Pocket-Piece , and 3 s. 6 d. in Money ; for 3 s. 6 d. was all that I saw . Patrick presented the Pistol , and then knock 'd him down with it ; and then we all fell upon him , and while he was down , tore off his Knee-Buckle with part of his Garter . Court . The Prosecutor swears , not that he left the Knee-Buckle when he was down , and you were all about him , but that you were going away , and then one turn 'd back , and took it from him as he was rising . Sutton . Booth took the Watch and Glass , and the Pocket-Piece , and I took the Money . That Day as I was taken ( which is 6 Weeks ago ) I came from Paddington-Fair with the 2 Prisoners , and parting with them near my Lord Bingly 's House , I had not gone far , before I was apprehended by 3 or 4 Men , who carried me to the House of one Brock * , in Drury-Lane , and took me up Stairs , and there ( before I was examin 'd by a Justice ) Tom How , Will James , and Will Pember took my Informaion in Writing . I lay that Night in the same House along with Tom How , and next Morning they carried me before Justice Robe . * Alias Brogdon Poplet . Court . Those People ought not to take upon them to prepare and draw up Informatons , and to settle among themselves whatever they design the Informist shall swear before a Justice , or in this Court . Informations are to be taken before a proper Magistrate , that the Publick may be satisfied , that no unfair Practices have been made use of . Patrick . Whither did we go after the Robbery ? Sutton . To an Alehouse in Holborn , where I never was before , there we had 2 full Pots of Beer . From thence we went to the King 's Arms , the Corner of Laurence-Lane , in St. Giles 's , where we lay all 4 in one Bed . I pawn 'd the Watch in the Name of James Hargrove , for 38 s. at a House near Clare-Market ; but I do n't know the Name of the Street , nor the Pawnbroker . I pawn 'd the Hat for 2 s. 6 d. and the Shoe-Buckles for 3 s. near Hicks 's Hall , and Will Booth sold the Pocket-Piece for 10 d. William Noon , the Pawnbroker 's Man . I ca n't swear positively that Sutton brought the Watch to me , only as he confess 'd it at Kirk 's House . I took it in on the 3d of July in the Morning , it was Numb . 441. made by Love ( or Lugg ) . I deliver 'd it to Mr. Kirk , and he paid me 38 s. Evan Bedward . I was charg 'd with the Prisoners , and carried them to New-Prison , but Sutton not being committed , he absconded , and then Will Booth was made an Evidence in his room . Will Booth . We all met at one Buck 's , a Gin-shop in St. Giles 's , where we use to drink ; and from thence we went towards the Bason in Marybon-fields , where we met this French Gentleman . Patrick held a Pistol to his Head , they struggled , and Patrick knock 'd him down with the Pistol . I took his Watch , and a Copper Pocket-Piece , and Glass ; Sutton took his Handkerchief , Hat , and 3 s. 6 d. and Meeds took his Shoe-buckles , and one Knee-Buckle , and tore the Garter off with it . Then we went over the Fields , and hid the Hat by a Bank ; so to the Two Brewers in Holborn , where we had 2 Pots of Beer , and then went to the King's-Arms in Laurence-Lane , where we all lay in one Bed for 1 s. Next Morning Sutton went to the Three Cocks , near Hicks's-Hall , and pawn 'd the Hat for 2 s. 6 d. the Buckles in Chick-Lane for 3 s. 6 d. and the Watch by Clare-Market for 38 s. and I sold the Pocket-Piece for 10 d. in Holborn . Then we went to an Alehouse over the Water , kept by Meeds 's Mother 's Acquaintance ; there we eat Bread and Butter and Cucumbers , and drank Bottled-Ale , and shared the Money : We threw away the Handkerchief , and threw the Knee-Buckle over St. George 's Church , and the Pocket-Glass over a House in Holborn . Patrick . Where were we the Night before the Robbery ? Booth . At Buck 's Gin shop , where we all met , and where we use to be Night and Day . Patrick . At what Hour was the Robbery committed ? Booth . About 9 or 10 at Night . Patrick . After we were taken , Will James , Tom How , and William Pember , the Thief-Takers , sat drinking with us , and Will James call 'd me aside , and desir 'd me to be an Evidence . He told me they had treated Sutton with Fowls , and next Morning they gave him leave to go to his Father 's , and he run away ; and that if I would be an Evidence , he would get me part of the Reward , and be bound Body for Body that I should be out of Prison the Day after the Sessions . Meeds . I have several Persons to my Character . Tho Harrison . Meeds is a Plaisterer ; he lived in my House last Year , and behaved well . Jos . Martin . I have known him 3 Years ; I have seen him go out in the Morning , and return at Night in his working Cloaths , and I know nothing to the contrary , but that he went to work . I have trusted him in my House when I have had 100 l. worth of my Lord Grantham 's Goods under my Care , and I never miss 'd any thing . Mrs. Lorain Haycock . I have known him these 15 Years , and have always liv 'd in the same Neighbourhood , but never heard the least of him before . He has been married a Year , and follow 'd his Plaistering Business . William Paget . I have known him 8 Years ; I have frequently seen him pass by to his Work , and repass . He always had a good Character . William Bauk . I am a Waterman ; I take in a great Quantity of Goods under my Care ; he has liv 'd in my House 2 Years ( within these 4 Years ) and I never miss 'd any thing ; he us 'd to come and go about his Plaistering Work , and had a very good Character . Second Indictment . Mary Cowling . On the 10th of July , between 8 and 9 in the Evening , in my Return from Marybon , 4 Men met me by my Lord Bingly 's House , the Corner of Cavendish-square ; I stept aside to give 'em the way , but one of them holding up a Pistol , cry 'd Stand ; or I 'll shoot you thro ' the Head . I hope , says I , you are not Rogues indeed . But presently one of them threw me down , turn 'd up my Coats , and took hold of my Pocket , and pull 'd it off . There was in it a Mother-of-Pearl Snuff-Box lin 'd with Silver , a Fan , a Toothpick-Case , and a Toothpick . I was fetch 'd before Justice Robe to own my Box , which was brought there by one William How from St. Ann 's . William How . I am a Baker ; but my Wife keeps a Chandler's-shop , and sells a Dram . On the 11th of July , Sutton and Booth , and the 2 Prisoners came to my Shop to drink ; they staid about half an Hour , and then Sutton and the Prisoner Patrick call 'd me aside into the Entry , and desir 'd me to lend them 7 s. 6 d. on this Box , which I did , and they paid me for the Liquor , and went away . Tom How and 2 other Men came about 8 in the Morning , and enquir 'd if I had not receiv 'd such a Box of Booth ? I told 'em I had such a Box . I went with them before Justice Robe , and there deliver 'd the Box to Thomas Owen . I knew Sutton had good Friends , and therefore I thought the Box had been his own . Sutton . We robb 'd the Prosecutor by Scavender [ Cavendish ] Square , and cut off her Pocket . There was a Fan and a gilt Snuff-Box in it , and some other odd Things . We tore the Fan and the Pocket , and threw them away . We attack 'd her as she was coming from Owen 's ( the Half-way House from Marybon ) she stept aside , Patrick held a Pistol to her , she scream 'd ; Meeds hit her in the Face , she fell down , and we cut off her Pocket . I kept the Snuff-Box all Night , and next Morning we went to a Gin-shop in St. Giles 's , and from thence to Will How 's . Booth . We met the Prosecutor by Scavenger-square , and said one to t'other , Let 's rob her . Patrick held a Pistol to her ; Sure , says she , you are not Rogues ? Yes , but we are , said we . Sutton hit her in the Face . Court . Are you sure it was Sutton ? for he swears it was Meed . Booth . I can safely swear it was Sutton . Besides other Things , we took a Pocket-Piece from her with a V o ' top o n't . Then we went over the Fields , sat down in the Grass , search 'd the Pocket , and then tore it , and threw it away . Sutton kept the Box all Night . Next Morning we went to the Gin-shop , and from thence to Will How 's ; Sutton and Patrick went out with How , and borrow 'd 7 s. 6 d. on the Box . Patrick . While we were at Will How 's , Sutton came in , and said he had got the Box from his Sister , and therefore would treat us . The Jury found them guilty of both Indictments . Death . 29 , 30 , 31.

Dorothy Blackstone . On the 28th of June , as I was coming along Gravener [ Grosvenor ] Street , between 10 and 11 at Night , I was attack 'd by 5 Street-Robbers . One of them held out a Pistol , and bid me Stand . I knowing some Chairmen were near , call 'd out for Assistance , when he that had the Pistol struck me on the Head with the but-end of it , and cut me sadly . Then they took away my Pocket with 4 Guineas , 4 Handkerchiefs , a Snuff-Box , and a pair of Gloves . They went two or three Steps from me , when one of them turned back , and pulled off my Apron . tho ' the others desired him not to do it . If I can judge ( considering the Fright I was in ) I think he in the middle [ Viner White ] was the Person that pull 'd off my Apron ; but it 's a Case of Life and Death and I would not be positive for the World . It was indeed a Moonlight Night , but I was robb 'd on the dark Side of the Way . They went away thro ' Grosvenor Meuse . I called to the Chair-men , but they lost 'em . Booth . Sutton and I with the Prisoners , went round Grosvenor-Square , and seeing no body but the Prosecutor , Patrick and Meeds went and got before her , by the End of Little George-street , and stopt her . Says she , What do you want ? And , says Patrick , What , are you saucy ? And with that he cut her over the Head with his Pistol . So that the Blood ran down . She cry 'd out and Meeds cut her Pocket off . There was 3 Guineas , an old Handkerchief , and a Pair of Gloves in it . I found no more Money , but Meeds , I believe , had finger 'd her Pocket first , and then bid me take it . As we were going away , Viner White turned back and pull 'd off her Apron . When we came to a Lamp in Piccadilly , we took out the Things . I had the 3 Guineas . We threw the Gloves over the Rails of a Gentleman 's House ; and then we went to a Gin shop in Drury-lane , over-against Short 's Gardens ( where we knew the People usually got up by 2 in the Morning . ) There we pawn 'd the Handkerchief for Half a Pint of Gin , and staid till 8 or 9 a Clock ; and from thence we went to the Goat in Newport-Market , and got some Steaks for Breakfast . Viner White . Booth has ow 'd me a spite ever since I beat him in the Skettle-Ground . Sutton . We robb 'd the Prosecutor in Grosvenor-street by the Corner of Little George-street . Patrick struck her on the Head with a Pistol , and knock 'd her down . Meeds cut her Pocket , in which was 3 Guineas , a Handkerchief , and a Pair of Gloves . Then we went over White-Conduit Field , and so to a Gin-shop in Drury-lane , where we pawned the Handkerchief . Court . Was there nothing else taken from her ? Sutton . No , nothing . Court . The Prosecutrix swears , and so does Booth too , that one of you turned back , and pull 'd off her Apron . Sutton . I believe there was an Apron , now I think o n't . The Jury found them guilty of the Indictment . Death . 32 . 33 , 34 , 35. Charles Patrick , and William Meeds , was a fourth Time ; Viner White , a second Time ; and John Vaughan , were indicted for assaulting James Smith , Clerk , in an open Place or Field near the High way , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Snuff-box , value 20 s. a Gold ring , value 20 s. 3 Iron Keys , value 5 s. one Guinea , two Half-Guineas , and 5 s. July 17 . James Smith . On the 17th of July , about 10 at Night , as I was coming from London to Kentish-Town , I met 5 Boys . One of them held a Pistol to my Head , and said , If you speak a word , you 're a dead Man . Deliver your Money , Doctor ! I answer 'd and said , Gentlemen , I am in your Power , do with me as you please . Then 3 of them rifled me of a Guinea , and 3 Half-Guineas . I had my Snuff-box in my Hand , and thinking to save it , I flung it into the Ditch . They observed it , and asked me what it was that I had flung into the Ditch ? I told them , Nothing ; but they would not take my Word , for one of them stopping down , found the Snuff-box . They felt about my Waistcoat Pocket , and asked me what I had got there ? And I said , Only some Drugs for poor People ; and so they went away . It was so dark I ca n't be sure that the Prisoners are any of those that robbed me , W. Booth . I and the 4 Prisoners were at Buck 's Gin-shop in St. Giles 's all Day , and at Night we concluded to go a robbing . We went up Tottenham-Court Road , and near the Halfway-house , betwixt Hampstead , and Kentish-Town , we met this Parson ( the Prosecutor . ) Patrick had one Pistol , and I another . Patrick went up to the Parson , and bid him stand ; and then searching one of his Pockets , took out 3 s. and some Halfpence , and two Farthings ; and Meeds searching the other , found 3 Half Guineas . I saw the Parson throw something down , and asking him what it was that he threw away , he said , he threw away nothing . Yes , but you have , says I ; and stooping down , I found it was a Silver Snuff box . I took it up and gave it to Vaughan , and he afterwards gave it to his Creature , who is now in Newgate , and she sold it for 6 s. and brought us the Money . It was an old-fashion 'd Box , all wroughted at Top . While the others were examining the Parson 's Pockets , Vaughan and White stood threatning to shoot him thro ' the Head if he did not stand still ; but I 'll say that for the Gentleman , he was very easy . Smith . Not so easy as you think for . White . Was I there ? Booth . Yes . Patrick . Who held the Pistol to the Parson ? Booth . You did . Patrick . Of what Size were they that robb 'd you ? Smith . They were all Boys of a small Size . White . I had known Booth but a Fortnight , by playing at Skettles with him , and happening to meet with him and some others , as he was going Home , I bore him Company , and by the Way we met this Gentleman the Parson ; but as soon as I perceiv 'd they intended to rob him , I ran away . I have several People to my Reputation . Tho Cross . I have known him 10 Years , and never knew any Harm of him . He is a Smith by Trade , and has work 'd in my House . William Babh . I have known him 15 Years . He served his Time with his Father , a Stove-Grate-maker , in Tyburn-road , and he constantly work 'd with him since . James Parslow . I have known him 7 or 8 Years ; he has been at my House often ; his Father is a very honest Man , and his Mother an honest Woman . James Dryhurst . I have been his Neighbour 14 or 15 Years and always took him to be an industrious , working , honest Lad . James Blun . I have lived in the Neighbourhood 20 Years . I have known him from his Birth . He has work 'd many Years with his Father , and continued so to do , till he was taken up . Richard Ball . I have known him for 7 or 8 Years to be a sober , honest , hard working , Pains-taking Lad . Edward Harvey . I have known White and Meeds from Children , they bore a good Character , and were as Pains-taking Lads as any in the Neighbourhood . Samuel Hoback . Vaughan was my Apprentice . I am a Plane-maker by Trade . He served me 3 Years , and then went to Sea , which is about 11 or 12 Years ago . But when he was ashore he often came to see me , as he did about 3 Months ago ; and I understood then that he was going to Portsmouth . While he lived with me , he was a faithful Servant . The Jury found all the Prisoners guilty . Death . 36. Jonathan Harding , of St. Clements Danes , was indicted for stealing a Calve 's skin dress 'd in Oyl , val . 3 s. the Goods of Tho . Dagly . July 18 . William Elliot . The Prisoner came into my Master 's Shop in Blackmoor-street , to buy a Skin . He had dealt at our Shop several Years . 'T is usual for our Customers to take the Skins down themselves , and look out what they want . The Prisoner did so , and solded one up , and put it under his Coat , then he look 'd out another , which he bought and paid me for , and went out with it in his Hand , the other Skin being still under his Coat . I follow 'd him out , and took it from him . He pretended it was a Mistake , and that he did not design to steal it . Then he offer 'd to pay for it , and would have given me 2 s. to make me Satisfaction . Several of the Prisoner 's Neighbours appeared to his Character . They deposed , that he was a very honest , sober Man ; that he lived in good Credit , kept a Shoemaker 's Shop , and had Business to employ 9 or 10 Journeymen . The Jury acquitted him . 37. William Holms of St. Giles 's Cripplegate , was indicted for assaulting Bartholomew Harnet on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a silver Buckle , value 4 s. and 5 s. 9 d. in Money , July 19 . Bartholomew Harnet . I hope your Lordship will please to give me Leave to discover something of my own Character , which some body here has vilified . I have a Letter sign 'd by the Mayor of Cork , and several other worthy Gentlemen , which will satisfy - Court . Let your own Character alone for the present , and tell the Court what you have to say against the Prisoner . Harnet . I lodge in London Alley in Moorfield 's . I had Occasion to go to one Citon 's , who keeps the Harp and Crown near Iron-gate . When I came from thence it wanted 10 Minutes of 10 a Clock at Night . I lost my Way as I was going Home , for I was a Stranger in Town , it being but 10 Weeks since I came from Ire-land . Somewhere or other I met the Prisoner , and asked him which was the Way to Bishopsgate-street . He said , that the Way I was going was one Way , but not the right Way . I told him I would give any Body a Penny or Two-pence to shew me . He offer 'd to go with me himself , and I consented . Then he carried me up one Street , and down another , till I had gone , I believe , thrice as far as it was to my Lodging . Sir , says I , you must certainly be wrong ; you have either surrounded me , or lost your Way yourself . No , says he , you was a great deal out of your Way when I met you , but now I shall soon set you right . So in a little time more he brought me into Upper-Moorfields ; then I told him that I know whereabouts I was , and therefore would give him no farther Trouble ; and with that I offer 'd him a Penny . He said , that would not do , for he had come a great Way with me . Then says I , you shall have 2 d. He said he would have more ; but I told him he should have no more , and I would not be impos 'd on . I had no sooner spoke but he whistled , and up came another Fellow , who clapt a Pistol to my Breast , and swore , if I stirr 'd or spoke , I was a dead Man . Then they turn 'd both my Pockets inside out , and took from me 5 s. 9 d. Says the Prisoner , I believe your Buckles are Silver ; as indeed they were , but I told him they were not . However , he took one out and look 'd at it , and swore it was good Silver . No , indeed , says I , they are but white Metal , they cost me no more than a Groat , and if you take 'em away , I have not a Groat more in the World to buy another Pair . Before he could take the other Buckle out of my Shoe , we heard some People talking , upon which , he and his Companion run away . Court . Was there any Light that you could see the Prisoner 's Face by ? Harnet . Yes ; I took Notice of him by the Lights at Peoples Doors as we came along ; he had a black Complexion , and bushy Hair , and his Hat was flap 'd ; and after he had robb 'd me , I recollected that I had seen him twice or thrice playing at Cudgels at the Ring in Moorfields ; and next Day I saw him there again , and so I took a Constable and apprehended him . John Heare , Constable . The Prosecutor came to me towards the Evening , and told me , that he had been robb 'd the Night before by a Man whom he had just then seen at the Wrestling-Ring in Moorfields . I went with him , he shew 'd me the Prisoner , and I took him , and carried him to the King's-head Tavern ; there the Prosecutor desir 'd me to search him , which I did ; and in his right-side Coat-pocket , among some Goosberries , I found this Silver Buckle ; the Prosecutor said , it was the Buckle that he lost , and that he had the Fellow to it . Harnet . Yes , my Lord , and here it is , they are both mark 'd B H. Justice Harwood . When the Prosecutor was before me , he gave the same Account of the Prisoner . Coitham . My Lord , there is one John Yates , who I believe they have designedly kept out of the Way . He assisted in taking the Prisoner , and told me , that he had heard the Prosecutor say , that when the Prisoner was at the Ring in Moorfields , he saw the Buckle upon him . Court . Where is this Yates ? Hoare . He was only my Assistant . I believe he 's at Doctor 's Commons ; if your Lordship thinks fit , I 'll step and see for him . Court . Aye , pray do . Philip Lewis . I live in Long-Alley , next Door to where the Prosecutor lodges . On the 9th of July , between 10 and 11 at Night , he came to my House , and gave me the same Account of his being robb 'd , as he has done now ; and he said the Fellow was a thin Man . Rebecca Jenkins . The Prosecutor is my Lodger : I was not within when he came home , but hearing he was at Mr. Lewis 's , I went to him , and there he told me the same Story . He had receiv 'd a Letter from his Wife at Cork , desiring him to go to Mr. Caton 's , by Tower-hill , and that was the Occasion of his going thither . George Quarrel . As I was going over Middle-Moorfields , near the Tentor-Ground , the Prosecutor was asking 2 Men what a Clock it was ? I told him past 10 . Says he , I have been robb 'd just by the Wooden House ( for so he call 'd the Booth . ) I walk 'd with him towards his Lodging , and there he took me by the Arm and Ing 'd me in , and said he lodg 'd there . Then he call 'd for a Quartern of Gin , and ask 'd me my Name ? I did not know what he meant by it ; I was almost afraid that he intended to charge me with the Robbery , tho ' as it happen 'd he did not ; but he pull 'd some Silver out of his Fob to pay for the Liquor . I wonder 'd how that Money escap 'd the Hands of the Man who robb 'd him . Hoare . My Lord , here is John Yates . Court . Swear him . John Yates . The Constable call 'd me to assist him in taking the Prisoner . We and the Prosecutor went towards the Ring ; the Prosecutor bid us stay where we were , while he went to look for the Prisoner : He staying some time , I went to see for him , and as soon as I met with him , says he , I 'll come presently , for I see the Man , and the Buckle upon him . Court . How could he see it upon him if it was in his Pocket ? Yates . His saying so made me think it was a Girdle-Buckle , and that the Man had got it fasten 'd to his Belt in the Wrestling Ring . I went back to the Constable , and the Prosecutor soon after came and call 'd us , and shew 'd us the Prisoner , and so we took him , and carried him to a Tavern . While we were there , as I was sitting at the Prisoner 's left Hand , and the Constable at his right , the Prosecutor desir 'd us to search him ; I searched the left Coat-Pocket next me , and found nothing ; but the Constable searching the right , pull 'd out some Goosberries , and a Silver Buckle . Hoare . When I found the Buckle the Prisoner was in a great Consternation , and said I put it in . Court to the Prosecutor . Upon your Oath , when you saw him at the Ring , did not you put the Buckle into his Pocket ? Prosecutor . No , indeed , my Lord . Court . What then did you mean when you said , you saw it upon him ? Prosecutor . I never said so . Yates . He said those very Words to me . Court to the Prisoner . Have you any Witnesses to prove where you was at the Time he swears the Robbery was committed ? Prisoner . Yes , my Lord , several . James Towers . I am his Father-in-Law . I have known him 3 or 4 Years ; he 's a Sawyer by Trade , follows his Work regularly , and has the Character of an honest , industrious Man . On Wednesday the 19th of July ( I remember the Time , because it was the Day before the Prisoner was taken up ) I was with him at a House over-against the Red-Lyon in Petticoat-Lane , from half an Hour past 8 till full 11 , and he was not out of the House once in all that time . At 11 he and I , and his Sister and Wife went home with him to Old Badlam , and there I saw him undress 'd , and ready to go to Bed . Susan Holms . I am his Sister . I was at Supper with him at Mr. King 's ( which is in Mr. Plimpton 's House ) in Petticoat-Lane ; we went thither at half an Hour after 8 , and staid till 11 . He was in the Room all the while ; we went home together , and saw him and his Wife both a-bed , and I believe asleep . Thomas King . He came to my House between 8 and 9 , and staid till 11 , and I was with him all the time , and so was my Wife , and his Sister . Mrs. Maxstead . As they were going out the Watchman went past 11 . Mrs. King . I dress 'd the Supper . He came between 8 and 9 , and staid till 11 . Prisoner . My Lord , I have 30 or 40 People ready to speak to my Character . Court . There is no need of calling any . But you , Sir , [ to the Prosecutor ] have need enough to call somebody to your Reputation . What Business do you follow ? Harnet . I have not been long in England ; I kept a Brandy-shop in Cork ; but being charg 'd with Running Goods , I was forc 'd to abscond . The Jury , without going from their Seats , gave in their Verdict not guilty . Then the Court order 'd , that the Prisoner 's Irons should be taken off immediately ; that he should be forthwith discharg 'd without Fees , and that the Prosecutor , Harnet , should be committed to Newgate , in order to be try 'd next Sessions for Perjury . 38 , 39. Edward Perkins and John Macgrady of St. Sepulchre 's , were indicted for assaulting Thomas Wallis in a Field or open Place near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Hat , Value 2 s. a Coat , Value 10 s. a Waistcoat , Value 6 s. a pair of Shoes , Value 6 d. a pair of Buckles , Value 3 d. a Piece of Foreign Coin , Value 1 d. August 2 . Thomas Wallis . On Wednesday August 2 between 7 and 8 in the Evening , as I was returning from Old Ford , I overtook 2 Men and one Woman in the Rope Walk , and having past them , the 2 Prisoners and another Man soon after came up , took me by the Throat , and knock 'd me into a Ditch ; one of them took my Hat , another my Shoes and Buckles , and a third unbutton 'd my Coat , and endeavour 'd to pull it off ; but knowing that the 2 Men I had overtaken just before could not be far behind me , I struggled and made some Resistance , in Hopes of their coming up to help me . But however , the Prisoner got off my Coat , and one of them put on my Shoes , and left me an old Pair of his in the room of them , and then they went away . I follow 'd them over a Field in my Shirt , but kept at some Distance . By and by I heard a Woman shriek inwardly , and soon after she cry 'd out Murder aloud . The two Men whom I had past were by this time but a little behind me , and they holla 'd . I run along the Bank ( the 2 Men still hallo'ing till I came to the Woman . She said , she had been robb 'd by three Men , that they had cut her Apron to cram into her Mouth , and then took away her Bundle , and run over the Fields . I look 'd and saw them running , and they were the same Men who had robb 'd me . But as they ran they dropt the Bundle they had taken from her . Next Sunday I was told , that 2 such Men were in the Watch-house in Rag-Fair ; I went to see them , and they proved to be the Prisoners . John Smith . On Thursday Morning the 3d of Aug . I was drinking at the Black Bay in Well-Street ; the Prisoners were there , and I heard them say , that they and Black Isaac had stript a Man by the Rope-Walk of a Coat and Waistcoat , and afterwards knock 'd a Woman down , and robb 'd her of a Bundle . So I went out and inform 'd against them . Court . Was you acquainted with them ? 't is very strange that they should talk of such Things in so publick a manner . Smith . I had drank with them at that House before ; not that I was ever concern 'd with them in any Robberies : But they were making their Brags of these Robberies before several Women in the Yard . John Matthews , Constable . I was sent for by Justice Ricards to take them up on Smith 's Information ; they both confess 'd the Fact , and where the Hat was pawn 'd , which was found accordingly . Perkins desired to be made an Evidence . William Cooper , Constable . They both confess 'd , and told us , that the Hat was pawn 'd at the Golden Ball in the Minories , and that Black Isaac run away with the Coat . The Pawnbroker deliver 'd the Hat to us very readily . Thomas Cooper . I happen 'd to be at the Queen 's Head in the Old Baily last Night ; the Prosecutor Wailis , and this Evidence Smith were then Eating and Drinking together ; they boasted of having these Prisoners in their Hands , and what good Bread they should make of 'em . Wallis . I said no such thing . Cooper . You said , it was very good Bread ; and Smith said , Aye , so it is , you have sworn one away already ; but have you got your Dosson ready ? And you made answer , and said , Yes , by God have I ; for I said it last Night instead of my Prayers . Smith . I was not at the Queen 's Head last Night . Matthews , the Constable . You was there several Hours ; I saw you there myself . Several Others . He was there ; we all saw him . Justice Ricards . The Prisoner Macgrady was first taken : He desir 'd to be made an Evidence , and made a voluntary Confession on the 6th of August , which was taken in Writing , read to , and then sign 'd by him . 'T is here in Court . Then the Confession was read . Macgrady therein says , that on Wednesday last , he and the Prisoner , and Black Isaac alias Isaac Wood , by the 4 Roads near Bethnal-Green , robb 'd a Man of a Coat , a Waistcoat , and a pair of Shoes , and presently after , Black Isaac knock 'd down a young Woman , and took a Bundle from her ; but they being pursued , dropt it , and she took it up again ; and that on the Thursday before , he , with one Daniel , who frequents the Black Boy Brandy-shop , committed another Robbery , and that they gave the Cloaths to Mary Angel , Rachel Oram , and - Beanmont , to sell for them . Justice Ricards . On the 11th of August , the Prisoner Perkins sent to me from New Prison , and made a Confession , which was likewise taken in Writing , and is in Court . [ Then the Confession of Perkins was read . ] He says , that 5 Weeks ago , he and Moco Jack broke into a Shed by White-Chapel Church , and stole from thence a Gown and other Apparel , which they carry 'd to the Black Boy , kept by one Emery and his Wife , who are Receivers of stolen Goods , and their Shop is a Rendezvous for Thieves . That he and Macgrady , and Black Isaac robb 'd a Man of his Coat and Waistcoat and Shoes , and knock 'd down a Woman , and took away her Bundle near Bednel Green , and that they gave the Goods they stole to Rachel Oram , Hester Unhill , Bacon Nan , and Mary Hannah to sell for 'em , and that Abel Gibson , alias White , Crab and Stocking who frequent the Black Boy , are Pick-pockets , and commonly attend at Night about Aldgate . The Jury found the Prisoners Guilty of the Indictment . Death . 40 , 41 , 42. Henry Thomas Sharp , Thomas Mills , and John Henly , of St. Mary le bon , were indicted for assaulting Richard Coats in a Field or open Place near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 2 s. 2 d. Halfpenny , August 16 . Richard Coats . On the 16th of August , between 8 and 9 in the Evening , I was robb 'd in Marybon-fields , by the three Prisoners of 2 s. 2 d. Halfpenny . Sharp was the first that came up to me , and said , Cooper , stand ( for I am a Cooper by Trade ) Aye , says I , so I will as long as I can . You have been doing Work and getting Money , says he , and we must have it . So you shall , says I , if you can get it . And with that he struck at me . I held up my Hand to defend myself , and struck at him with my Adz , upon which he fell back , and the other two came up and knock 'd me down , and laid me quiet . I saw all their Faces so fully that I subscribed [ described ] them the next Day to two Men , and they and I saw the Prisoners at Tottenham-Court-Fair , and dog 'd them as far as Snow-hill , and there they parted . Henly and Mills were follow 'd by my Friends to White-Chapel , and there they were lost , and I follow 'd Sharp to Smithfield , and took him . Ann Taylor . I live at Marybon Half way-House . About a Fortnight ago the Prosecutor had been at work for me , and then he went farther . He came back about 8 at Night ; I was then standing at my Door . He told me he had been robb 'd of 2 s. 2 d. Half-penny , and very much abused , and so indeed he was , for he could hardly go , and he describ 'd the Men to me . James Townsend . On Thursday the 17th of August , about 10 at Night , I had Word brought me , that a Constable was wanted to take a Street-Robber . It being my Watch-Night I took a Watchman with me , and went to the Bullhead Alehouse by Smithfield , and there I found the Prisoner Sharp and the Prosecutor . The Prosecutor told me , that he had been robb 'd , that Sharp knock 'd him down ; that he recovered himself , and thought he should have made his Part good with them , but they knock 'd him down again , and that some of them ( but he knew not which ) took 2 s. 2 d. Halfpenny from him . I desir 'd Sharp to confess if he was guilty , but he said he was innocent , and that he was Servant to Capt . Thorold , and could give an Account of himself . Next Day , being Friday , he was committed to Newgate . The Prosecutor got a Warrant for the other two ; one he said was a Piper , and the other ( whose Name he said was Henly ) was a Dancer at Tottenham-Court-Fair . I went to the Fair , and waited for them ; Mills was taken that Night , and Henly on the Sunday Morning following . When the 3 Prisoners were examined , they contradicted one another a little about their Acquaintance . I examin 'd into the Prosecutor 's Character ; he said he serv 'd his Time with Mr. Hopkins a Cooper in Thame-street , who had been dead 20 Years ; but I met with Mrs. Hopkin 's Son , who said , he knew the Prosecutor , and had employ 'd him . I enquir 'd of several other Coopers in and about Thames-street , who said , he was a very honest Fellow , and a good Workman , but that he lov 'd a Pot . - Evans . I live in Neals-Yard in St. Giles 's , near the Prosecutor . On Thursday Morning he came to me , and shew 'd me that his Hand was lame ; he said , that he had been robb 'd over Night in Marybon-fields ; that the last Place he was at in Marybon was Mrs. Taylor 's House , where he had earned 1 s. I told him of a House of ill Fame in Marybon ; we went thither to look for the Prisoners , but not finding them , we went from thence to Tottenham-Court-Fair , where we found them all 3 . We follow 'd them ( and 2 Oysterwomen with them ) to Holborn-bridge , and there they parted , and Mills and Henly , with the 2 Women went up Snow-hill . The Defence of the Prisoners . Sharp . When the Prosecutor took me up at the Bull-head in Smithfield , he said , he believ 'd I was the Man , but could not swear it . Upon which I told him , I 'd make him pay for false Imprisonment . Nay then , says he , right or wrong I 'd swear it . Capt . - The Prisoner Sharp , has been my Servant 6 Years , and I believe , has never been out of my Sigth 48 Hours together . I entrusted him with all my Stores , to take Money and give Receipts in my Name . He goes to School a Days , and lies a-Board a Nights . He 's a good Navigator , and was to have gone my second Mare in my next Voyage . Edward Stanly . I was drinking at the Bull Head , when the Prosecutor brought Sharp in with him , and said , Wo n't you sit down ? What do you want with me ? says Sharp , Why , says the Prosecutor , ( looking hard at him ) I believe you are one of the young Men that robb 'd me . What do you mean you Villian you ? says Sharp . But , says the Prosecutor , I can swear it was you , or the Devil in your Cloaths . Can you , says Sharp , why then if you do n't , I 'll charge a Constable with you for charging me with a Robbery . Sharp sent for a Constable , the Prosecutor said , If you are not the Mare , you may go about your Business . The Prosecutor was going out , Sharp stopt him , and said , he would make him pay for scandalizing him . Nay then , says the Prosecutor , Since you are saucy , I 'll swear it by God , right or wrong . Matthew Smith . I kept a Musick Booth in Tottenham Court Fair . I hir 'd Mills to play on the Hantboy , and Henly to dance . And on the Wednesday before they were taken , they were both in my Booth , one playing , and the other Dancing , from before 7 in the Evening till past 10 , and were never out , except they might step to the Door to piss , but no further . Another . Mills and I play 'd together that Night , and Henley danced at Mr. Smith 's Booth , and they were not out of the Booth from 7 to 10 . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners , and the Court order 'd the Prosecutor to be committed for Perjury . 43 , 44.

At 9 in the Morning , I left my Son about 6 Years old in the House , and lock 'd the Doors , and went out , and when I returned , I found all my Doors open , and the Prisoners eating my Meat , and drinking my Brandy . I desired them to go out by fair Means , but they would not . Court . Did not they come to Seize for Rent ? Dodderidge . I did not ask them ; I ow 'd but for part of a Quarter 's Rent . Mr. Goosetry . There was a Commission of Bankruptcy against Mr. Ward . The Assignees seiz 'd several of these Houses which had been part of Ward 's Estate , and I having a Letter of Attorney from them , sent these 2 Men to take Possession , and to move the Goods , which they did , but they were turned out again by a Warrant from Justice Robinson ( the Prosecutor calls him Cousin . ) I would have given 10,000 l. Bail for the 2 Men , but tho ' I went after the Justice several times , he would not see me . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners , and the Court granted them a Copy of their Indictment . 45. John Goodman of St. Sepulchres , was indicted for stealing a Grogram Coat , Value 45 s. a pair of Breeches Value 15 s. a Silk Waistcoat with Silver Lace , Value 3 l. a Wig and a pair of Shoes , the Goods of Henry Osborn , July 11 .

Mr. Osborn 's Box was brought into the Ware-House on the 10th of July ; and being mist the same Day , the Prisoner was examined , but deny 'd it , and absconded . Mr. Osborn valued it at 30 l. Upon which we advertis 'd it , and the Pawn-broker brought us the Waistcoat , which he said he had from Elizabeth Wells , who was the Prisoner 's Acquaintance . She was taken up , and confest she had it of the Prisoner , and directed us to the Place where we found him . He then confest that he took the Box out of the Ware-house , and gave her the Cloaths to pawn , and that she gave him all the Money . Eliz . Wells . I had the Goods of the Prisoner , who was my Countryman . He said the Owner wanted to borrow some Money upon them . I pawn 'd the Coat for 25 s. and the Breeches for 8 s. and gave him the Money . In like manner the other 2 Indictments were proved against the Prisoner , and the Jury found him Guilty of each . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 46. John Johnson , alias Drew , was indicted for assaulting William Arnold , Esq ; on the Highway , in the Parish of Kensington , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Gold-watch and Chain , value 16 l. a Cornelian Seal set in Gold , value 8 l. a Chrystal Seal set in Gold , value 3 l. and one Guinea , the 30th of May .

He was a fifth Time indicted for assaulting Benjamin Champion , on the Highway , in the Parish of Hendon , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch and Chain , val . 3 l. and 3 s. 6 d. in Money , July 20 . First Indictment . Prisoner , My Lor d , I have 2 Witnesses , Gentlemen of very good Credit , to prove that I was in another Place when these Robberies were committed ; but they can not come till to Morrow . Court . Which of the Robberies ? Prisoner . I ca n't say which in particular . Court . Then 't is a mere pretence for puting off your Trial . Mr. Arnold . On Whitsun Tuesday , the 30th of May last , between 8 and 9 in the Evening , as I was coming in a Chariot from Kensington to Chelsea , the Prisoner upon a bright Bay Horse , with a black Main and Tail , rode up to the Chariot Side , and demanded my Watch and Money . I delivered my Watch and a Guinea . Court . A Gold Watch ? Mr. Arnold . Yes ; there were two Seals hanging to it , one was a Cornelian , with my Coat of Arms , and the other a Chrystal with Cicero 's Head . My Perriwig-maker afterwards inform 'd me , that a Highwayman was apprehended , and that two such Seals , among other Things , were found in his Custody . I went to see the Prisoner in the Press-Yard , in Newgate , and knew him at first Sight . Prisoner . By what Circumstances did you know me , that you are so very sure of it ? Mr. Arnold . By the Features of your Face in general , and by your Eyes and Nose , which are pretty remarkable , in particular . Prisoner . You seem to swear mighty positively . I hope you have some Body in Court that will give you a Character ? Mr. Arnold . I was not on that side next him when he robb 'd me , so that I had a full view of his Face . The Gentleman who was with me in the Chariot , is now out of Town . Court . Was it light enough to see his Face distinctly ? Mr. Arnold . Yes , the Sun was scarcely set , and I observ 'd him in a very particular Manner . Prisoner . 'T is hard that I ca n't have a Witness to swear that I was in another Place at that time ; I was many Miles off . Thomas Harrison . I keep the Fox Alehouse , at Hungerford-Market . On Sunday , the 30th of July , the Prisoner and one Elizabeth Stannet , who goes for his Wife , came in a Coach to my House , and brought a Box , a Trunk , and a Parrot in a Cage , with them . They at first talk 'd of getting a Warrant to go by Water to Greenwich ; but afterwards said , they would stay till Master Jacky came . However , they went away between 12 and 1 , and charged me to take care of the Parrot , and to desire Jacky , when he came , to stay there for them . Next Morning Mr. Bays came from High-gate , to enquire after the Prisoner , and Stannet , and Jacky , and told me that Jacky had robb 'd him of 40 or 50 l. Jacky came about 9 o'Clock . Mr. Bays seiz 'd him , and he confess 'd that he had stolen the Goods , and that they were all in the Trunk . Soon after a Waterman brought this Letter * for Jacky . 'T is directed for John Carbury , but he goes by the Name of Conan . The Waterman said , that the Person he had it from was in his Boat . I look 'd out of Window , and saw the Prisoner in the Boat ; upon which the Constable went down and took him . When the Prisoner came up , he said to Mr. Bays , Billy , if Jacky has done this foolish Thing , and you can have your Goods again , I hope you will give him no farther Trouble . We ask 'd the Prisoner , whose Things they were in the Box and Trunk ? And he said , they belong 'd to the Gentlewoman [ Stannet . ] * To Mr. John Carbury , These , Jack , I beg you will take all the Things , and come where you was Yesterday as soon as you can ; you will see me as you come along on the Right-hand of the River , as soon as you are through Bridge . J. R. Court . Who left those Things with you ? Harrison . Both the Prisoner , and the Gentlewoman desir 'd me to help 'em to take those Things out of the Coach ; I took the Deal-Box , and the Parrot Cage , and the Coachman brought the Trunk . In the Trunk or Box , I know not which , we found , among other Things , 2 Seals , and 2 Rings , one of them a Diamond Ring . Madam said before the Justice , that the Seals were old Family Seals of little Worth , and that the Rings were her own . As those Seals were own 'd by no Body else , they were deliver 'd to the Care of James Golding the Constable . James Golding . The Seals were seal 'd up in this Purse by Mr. Hall , and then deliver 'd to me before Justice De Veil , they are now in the same Condition as when I receiv 'd them . The Prosecutor has not yet seen them . The Prisoner was taken on the Information of one Colney . Prisoner . I do n't know what Seals you have put into that Purse ; but you 're a perjur 'd Villain , you said at first , that they were seal 'd up with your own Seal . Court . Open the Purse , and take the Seals out . Harrison . These are the same Seals that I saw in the Box or Trunk . Mr. Arnold . And these are the 2 Seals that the Prisoner robb 'd me of . Here 's the Engraver who cut them . John Yeo . These are the same Seals I cut for Mr. Arnold . Here is an Impression that I took off from one of them ( the Cicero 's Head ) before I deliver 'd it to him , and it agreet exactly with the Seal . Prisoner . The Man that had the Seals made his escape ; and the same Man had the Watch that they belong 'd to ; the Trunk did not belong to me . William Bays . The Prisoner and Stannet took Lodgings near my Mother 's House , and he brought the Trunk with him , my Mother keeps the Red-Lion at Highgate . One Conan , whom they call Master Jacky , came to see him , and brought such a Horse with him as Mr. Arnold has describ 'd . They recommended Conan to my Mother for a Lodger , Conan lay at my Mother 's o ' Saturday Night , and robb 'd her of the value of 50 l. and went off ; on Sunday Morning the Prisoner brought a Hackney Coach from London , and he order 'd the Coachman to take in the Trunk , the Box , and the Parrot , and then Madam Stannet went into the Coach , the Coachman drove back again towards London ; but the Prisoner said he would walk over the Fields , and meet 'em out of Town . Finding that my Mother had been robb 'd , I went to London , and enquir 'd among the Hackney Coachmen , for one that had taken up a Gentlewoman and a Parrot at Highgate . The Circumstance of the Parrot being pretty remarkable , I found out the Coachman , and he told me , that he drove them to the Fox at Hungerford-Market ; and there Master Jacky , and Madam , and the Prisoner were taken and committed to the Gatehouse ; but Master Jacky made his escape out of Goal . Second Indictment . Mr. Pedley . On Friday the 23d of June , about 8 in the Evening , as I was coming along Cowhouse-Green , near Hendon , toward Hampstead , in a Chaise , the Prisoner came up on a Bay-Horse , with a black Main and Tail , and clapping a Pistol to my Breast , bid me deliver , or I was a dead Man ; I gave him my Watch and Seal , and 5 s. He told me if I ever advertis 'd the Watch , I was a dead Man . Then he went to this Lady ( Mrs. Wingfield ) who was in the Chaise with me , and said , God Damn you Madam - Court . That 's in another Indictment , you are now only to speak of what relates to your self . Prisoner . Are you sure it was I ? You 'll swear any Thing ; where do you live ? What dress was I in ? What Hat and Wig had I on ? Mr. Pedly . You had a whitish Coat , a light Bob-wig , and a scallop 'd lac 'd Hat . I am satisfy 'd that you are the Man , not only by your Face , but your Voice . Mr. Serjeant . I was at the Fox at Hungerford-Market , when the Prisoner and Jacky were taken . And this Seal was found in the Prisoner 's Box . I heard him own that it was his Box . I shew 'd the Seal to an Engraver , and he told me , the Arms belong 'd to the Name of Pedly ; and so upon enquiry I found out the Prosecutor . Eleanor Wingfield . I saw the Prisoner hold the Pistol to Mr. Pedly , and I cry 'd out to him not to shoot ; but he swore , and threaten 'd he would , if Mr. Pedley did not immediately deliver . I saw the Prisoner afterwards in the Press-Yard , and presently knew him to be the same Man . Third Indictment . Mr. Pedley . As soon as the Prisoner had robb 'd me , he went to Mrs. Wingfield , who was in the Chaise with me . He held a Pistol in his Right-hand , and extended his Left , in order to take her Purse . Prisoner . In order , did you see me take it ? Mr. Pedley . Yes ; it was a Green Purse , and I saw some Gold in it . Prisoner . You saw ; you do but think so , must a Man lose his Life upon your Thoughts ? How should you know what was in it ? Mr. Pedley . We called at a House , on Edgworth Road , and when I went to pay , they could not change my Money , upon which Mrs. Wingfield said , she had got small Money , and so she open 'd her Purse , and I saw several pieces of Gold in it . Prisoner . You swear very plain ; have you any thing else to say ? Mrs. Wingfield . When the Prisoner had robb 'd Mr. Pedley , he came to me , and in very rough Language demanded my Purse and Rings . I had no Rings , but gave him my Purse . There were in it a Moidore , a half 3 and 20 Broad-piece , a Quarter of 5 and 20 Piece , some Silver , and several Notes . Prisoner . Do you swear that you was in the Chaise with Mr. Pedley ? Mrs. Wingfield . Yes . Prisoner . And pray what Horse did I ride ? Mrs. Wingfield . A bright Bay , with a black Main and Tail . Prisoner . Well , I must not be suffer 'd to stay till I can have my Witnesses , and therefore I am incapable of defending my self any longer ; 't is very hard . But are you sure , Madam , that I am the Man ? Mrs. Wingfield . Yes , very sure ; I knew you again , the first time I saw you in the Press-Yard . Prisoner . Pray , Madam , what have these Whores-Birds given you to swear all this ? Are you Mr. Pedley 's Wife ? Mrs. Wingfield . No ; but I am a near Relation . He was try 'd next Day on the fourth Indictment . Mrs. Champion . On the 20th of July I was robb 'd between Hendon and Edgworth , by the Prisoner in a Mask ; he took from me 3 Rings , a Guinea , and some Silver ; but as soon as he had robb 'd me , he pull 'd off his Mask , and look 'd me full in the Face for a Minute . I think this is he , I remember his Eyes in particular . These are two of the Rings he took from me . Mr. Serjeant . On the 1st of August , I found these Rings in the Prisoner 's Box , at the Fox in Hungerford-Market . I traced out Mr. Champion by the Arms on his Seal ( for he had been robb 'd of his Watch and Seal ) and he describ 'd the Rings to me before he saw them . Prisoner . I 'll give the Court no more trouble . The Court judg 'd it unnecessary to try him on the fifth Indictment . The Jury found him Guilty of all the four . Death . 47 , 48 John Bumpus , and William Shelton , of Stoke-Newington , were indicted for assaulting Edward Waldo Dorrington , on the Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Drugget Coat , value 3 s. a Cane , value 5 s. and 6 s. 6 d. in Money , the 4th of May . E. W. Dorrington . I am Journeyman to an Apothecary , at Stoke-Newington . On Thursday the 4th of May , about Midnight , I was called out of Bed , our Boy told me , that a tall Man at the Door wanted me , to go immediately to one Burcher , who was taken very ill at Mother Red-Caps , on Stanford-Hill . I told the Boy that I would not go , except the Man who came for me would stay , and go with me . When I came down Stairs , I found the tall Man waiting , and went with him ; but we had not gone far before I was attack 'd by 2 Men in Masks , one was a little Man , and the other middlesiz 'd . I look 'd for my tall Friend to assist me , but he join 'd with the other Rogues ; one of the two clapp 'd a Pistol to my Breast , and demanded my Money ; they robb 'd me of 6 s. 6 d. my Cane , and my Coat , and then bid me go forward towards Mother Red-Caps . I believe the Prisoner Bumpus is the tall Man who came for me . He 's like him , but I will not be positive . Robert Ward . On the 4th of May last , the 2 Prisoners and I met at Mr. Blackwell 's , the Cakeman , in Purple-Lane , by Hatton-Garden , and we agreed to go and rob upon Enfield Road . We went to Stoke-Newington , and sent Bumpus to Mr. Haycocks , the Apothecary 's , to tell him that the Man at Mother Red-Caps was taken with an Apoplectick Fit , and wanted him presentl . Bumpus came and told us ( for we wanted hard by ) that the Man would not come except he staid to come with her . We bid him go back and wait , which he did , and brought the Prosecutor with him ; Shelton demanded the Prosecutor 's Coat and Money . I afterwards heard that Shelton was taken up at Maidstone , and so to ease my Conscience , and for fear of being hang 'd , if he should swear against me , I made my self a voluntary Evidence , as soon as I had an opportunity of taking Bumpus , which was on the 29th of July last . I met him accidentally in Newgate-Street , and asking him to go and drink with me ; I took him to the Sun Coffee-House , under Sir William Billers 's Office . I left him there , and finding Mr. Taylor the Constable , at Sir William 's Door , I surrender 'd my self , and went with him before Sir William , and gave my Information , and then we went and took Bumpus in the Coffee-House . Thomas Taylor . As I stood at Sir William 's Door , Ward came , and said , that he had decoy 'd one of his Accomplices into the Sun Coffee-House , and wanted to make himself an Evidence . I went with him before the Alderman , and he gave the same Account of the Robbery there , as he has done here . Joseph Bird . Ward having made his Information before Sir William , which agrees with what he swears now , Mr. Taylor and I went directly and took Bumpus , who made a very shuffling Defence when he was examin 'd . Mr. Taylor again . Bob Ward saying that Bumpus had the Prosecutor 's Coat , and put it on , ( his own being ragged ) as soon as it was taken from the Prosecutor , says Bumpus , You 're a lying Rogue , for we came as far as Hackney before I put it on . Mr. Foreman . I know that Bumpus and Bob Ward are acquainted , they us 'd to meet at Bob Ward 's Brother 's , who lodg 'd at a Chandlers Shop , in Purple-Lane . Mr. - I was walking in Chatham , one Saturday in July , when I happen 'd to meet Shelton . He said , he was very glad to see me I was shy of his Company , having heard an ill Character of him . I went to my Father and telling him who I had met , my Father told me Shelton was a Highway-man ; upon this I went with some Friends to Rochester to apprehend him , and meeting with him just as he had got into the Stage-Coach , we seiz 'd him . Shelton . I am sorry to hear that Gentleman gave me such a Character , I did not expect it from him above all Men , for he knows nothing of me , but by common Fame . Court . It 's not for your Credit that common Fame reported you to be a Highway-man . Shelton . Here 's Mr. Ford , the Apothecary , knows my Character . Mr. Ford . I have known but little of him within this 12 Month , he had a good Character formerly ; he kept an Apothecary 's Shop in Cheshunt , and has been at my House in Leadenhall-Street ; but lately I have indeed heard it whisper 'd that he was a Highway-man . Shelton . I never was intimate with Ward , I had but a small Acquaintance with him . Bumpus . I have indeed been 2 or 3 times in Ward 's Company ; but I know very little of him , tho ' upon that small Knowledge he ask 'd me to go and drink , when I met him by chance in Newgate-Street . - Bumpus , the Prisoner 's Brother . I am a Taylor by Trade . My Brother was originally a Barber , and sometimes he was a Drawer at a Coffee-House , and other times , when he was out of Business , he liv 'd with me . Ward 's Father said , he would swear my Brother 's Life away for a Farthing . Stephen Gaper , Brush-maker in Duck-Lane . I have known him from a Child ; but I know little of his Behaviour within this 12 Month . Mr. Taylor again . When Bumpus was before Sir William , he desir 'd to be made an Evidence , and I think he said , he could swear against Ward 's Brother . The Jury acquitted Shelton , and found Bumpus Guilty of the Indictment . Death . 49. William Shelton , of Enfield , was a second Time indicted for assaulting Tho How on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 3 s. the Money of James Miller , the 10th of June . Thomas How . On the 10th June , I was at Enfield-Market , and about 11 at Night , I was getting my Horse ready , at the Door of the King's-Head Inn , the Ostler stood with a Candle to light me while I put my Packs on , and while I was making them fast , the Prisoner , whom I knew very well , ( for he had been my Play-fellow ) rode up to the Inn Door , upon a black Horse with a bald Face , and call 'd for a Pint of Beer , he look 'd full in my Face , and I in his . Before the Beer was brought , he said , he was going to Dr. Wilson 's , and would return in a Moment ; but he did not come back at all . Says I to some other Market Folks , there 's Will Shelton come , and if we do n't leave our Money , we shall all be robb 'd . I had 6 l. of my Master 's Money , which I left at the Inn , and took only 3 s. in my Pocket ; and other People took my advice , and left their Money too ; and so I and Ben Johnson set out together . Between Forty-Hill and Maiden's-Bridge , the Prisoner attack 'd me , and bid me deliver , he call 'd me by my Name Tom . Give 's your Bag , Tom , says he , for you have taken Money to Day at Market . Indeed Master I have got but 3 s. says I ; No , Tom , says he , Why then you have made but a bad Market . Why , to tell you the Truth , Master , says I , I have left the rest of my Money behind me . Well then , give 's the 3 s. says he , and so I gave it him . Prisoner . Did you see my Face when I attack 'd you ? How . No , you had a Mask on , but I knew your Voice . Benjamin Johnson . Tom How jump 'd off his Horse at the King's-Head Gate , and came into the Inn , and swore a great Oath that Shelton was at the Door , and if we did not leave our Money , we should all be robb 'd ; so I left mine , and took only 3 s. 4 d. in my Pocket . As I was riding homewards with Tom How , a Man in a black Mask , and upon a black bald-fac 'd Horse , came up and robb 'd us ; he demanded my Money , and I gave him only the odd 10 d. and so bit him of the half Crown . Charles Holliday , Ostler . While I was assisting Tom How to put his Packs on , holding his Horse in one Hand , and a Candle in the other , the Prisoner in a dark grey Coat , came riding up to us upon a black bald-fac 'd Horse , and call 'd for a Pint of Beer ; he did not stay to drink it , for he said , he was going to Dr. Wilson 's , and would be back immediately , but we saw him no move ; I knew the Prisoner when he liv 'd at Dr. Halsey 's in Enfield . Henry Portman . As I was going along the Road with a Candle and Lanthern , about a Quarter of a Mile from where the Robbery was committed , I saw Johnson and How ride by , and presently after , as I was crossing the Road , I saw a Man come back on a bald-fac 'd Horse ; he came up the Hill a great pace . Prisoner . I had been at Brocksburn ; call 'd upon Brigadier Franks , at Enfield , and then came to the King's-Head Inn , and call 'd for a Pint of Beer ; but recollecting that I had some Business at Dr. Wilson 's , I went thither , and it being late I did not return to the Inn as I intended , but rode directly for London . The Place where they say they were robb 'd is between Forty-Hill and Maiden's-Bridge , about 2 Miles and a Half from Enfield . The Road there is so narrow , that a Horse ca n't pass a Coach , and therefore is a very improper Place to commit a Robbery in . My Horse was Chesnut , not black , and had a small Blaze down his Face , but was not bald-fac 'd . It 's very unlikely that any of these Witnesses should see the Colour and Marks of my Horse so plainly in the dark , as to be able to know them . Charles Holliday again . The Prisoner not coming again to drink the Beer that he call 'd for at our Door , the Drawer went to enquire for him at Dr. Wilson 's ; but was told , that he had not been there . Brigadier Franks . It was very unlikely that the Prisoner should call at my House , as he says he did , when he had robb 'd me of a Watch not long before . The Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . Death . 50 , 51. Paul Cray and Louis de Vic , were indicted for stealing a Gold Ring set with Diamonds , value 60 l. a Tortoise-Shell Snuff-Box inlaid with Gold , value 3 l. 3 s. a Velvet Housing [ for a Horse ] embroider 'd with Gold , value 35 l. 2 Velvet Pistol-cases embroider 'd with Gold , value 5 l. a Cloth Coat with Gold Lace , value 10 l. a Cloth Coat with Silver Lace , value 10 l. a Silk Waistcoat with Gold Lace , value 5 l. a Silk Waistcoat with Silver Lace , value 5 l. a pair of Cloth Breeches , value 15 s. 3 pair of Thread Stockings , value 7 s. 7 Cambrick Handkerchiefs , value 20 s. 3 Silk Handkerchiefs , value 5 s. 2 Holland Caps , value 5 s. and 3 pair of lac 'd Ruffles , value 3 l. the Goods of Abraham Elton , Esq ; in the House of Jane Gibbons , in the Parish of St. Martins in the Fields , on the 24th of July last . Lewis de Vic not understanding English , a Gentleman was sworn to Interpret between him and the Court . Mr. Elton . On Thursday the 20th of July , I pack 'd up the Goods mentioned in the Indictment , in my Trunk , which I left at my Lodging , in the House of Mrs. Jane Gibbons , in Suffolk-Street , and went to Tunbridge . The two Prisoners lodg 'd in the Room above mine . On the Wednesday following I receiv 'd a Letter from Mrs. Gibbons , informing me , that the two French Gentlemen ( the Prisoners ) had broke open my Trunk , and were going off , but that she had got two Suits again . I return 'd to Town next Morning , when Mrs. Gibbons open 'd the Door to me , she was ready to sink . I bid her not be so concern 'd , for I did not lay the blame on her . My Trunk had Drawers at bottom , in which I had put my Linen , and my Diamond Ring ; I was on Hopes they had miss 'd those Drawers , but upon searching , I found they had not , for my Ring was gone with the rest of my Goods . When Mrs. Gibbons had a little recover 'd herself , she told me , that a Porter had brought a Letter for me from the Marquis . Court . What Marquis ? Mr. Elton . The Prisoner Lewis de Vic ; but she said , the Porter would not leave it , he having orders to deliver into it my Hand , or else to the Person who keeps the Tennis-Court . I went to that Person , and he gave me the Letter . It was in French , and is dated London , July 25 . Mr. Watson , the Serjeant who took the Prisoners at Sittingbourn in Kent , brought me another Letter the same Morning , dated at Settingbourn , July directed to me , by the Name of Hitton , at Gravesend . I have the 2 Original Letters here , they are both sign 'd De Vic . Court . How do you know that he wrote them ; have you ever seen him write ? Mr. Elton . Yes ; and I verily believe these to be his Hand . L. de Vic . I own that I wrote both those Letters . Court . Then they may be read in Evidence . [ The Interpreter reads in English . ] The First Letter . I Am extreamly concern 'd , Sir , that I am obliged to write to you to beg you to consider the melancholy Situation I am in at present ; by having association with a Man capable of such a Fact . You find by your self that I am very innocent ; therefore , Sir , I beg you to suspend your ju Anger , and do me the Favour to wait , till I have learned where that unhappy man has lodged the things , and as soon as we shall not it from one who was with him , whose Name is Maccarty .

I am , Sir , in Hopes of this Favour from you , Your , most humble and most obedient Servant , De Vic . London , 25 . July 1732 . If I can learn by any indirect mean that you are disposed not to prosecute me , I will surrender my self to you to prove that I am a Man of Honour . The First Letter .

Mr. Elton . When Mr. Watson brought me this last Letter , he told me , that the Prisoners were brought to Gravesend . I took Coach the same Day , and drove thither ; as soon as I came into the Room where the Prisoners were , Paul Cray fell on his Knees , and beg 'd me to be merciful . I took this Snuff-Box , and 3 pair of Ruffles upon him . They both own 'd the Fact , and Cray told me , that my Ring was sold to Mr. Darker , a Jeweller in the Strand , and De Vic said , that he had left my Horse Furniture with Mr. Maine , a Taylor , in the Strand , who had let him escape . As soon as I came home , the Maid told me , that Mr. Maine had left the Furniture at my Lodgings . P. Cray . Mr. De Vic gave me the Snuff-Box and Ruffles at Gravesend , a little before Mr. Elton came into the Room . George Watson , Serjeant . I was in General Tatton 's Regiment . And hearing that 2 Foreigners , who were gone towards Dover , had robb 'd a Gentleman in Suffolk-Street of 500 l. I pursu 'd them to the Red-Lyon , at Sittingbourn , where I found them both at Dinner together . Paul Cray , who spoke English , ask 'd me , how far I was bound ? I told him to Dover . He said , they were going the same Road , and should be very glad of my Company . I reply 'd , I had a little Business to dispatch in the Town , and then I would wait upon them . I went out to see for a Constable , but could find none . I acquainted the Man of the House with the Affair , and desir 'd his Assistance ; but he was afraid to venture . By this time the Prisoners were ready to mount ; but I resolving that they should not escape , seiz 'd on De Vic , just as he had put one Foot in the Stirrup , and oblig 'd him to go in again . I search 'd them , and found this Box upon Cray , and examining him about it , says he , De Vic has broke open Mr. Elton 's Trunk , and stole several of his Goods , and has given me some of them . Among other Things that be took out , there was a Diamond Ring , that was sold to Mr. Dautry ( I think he call 'd him ) in the Strand . De Vic told me , that he , had left his own Cloaths and Sword , and Mr. Elton 's Horse Furniture , with a Taylor in the Strand ; who , he said , knew that the Furniture was stolen . Cray then took me aside , and said , My dear , I am an Officer in the French Service , and if you 'll go over with me I 'll procure a Commission for you After this De Vic call 'd for a Pen and Ink , and wrote this French Bill , which Cray took up , and gave me . He said it was a Bill of Exchange , drawn on De Vic 's Uncle ( who was Ambassador in Holland ) for a 1000 Livres , and if I would go thither , I might have the Money directly . I kept it , and seem 'd to believe 'em , till I could get more Assistance to bring them home . De Vic . I own I wrote that Bill . Court . Then let it be read . Interpreter . This Bill has no Date . [ reads . ] For One Thousand Livres French Money . SIR , By this only Bill of Exchange he pleas 'd to pay to the Bearer of this Present , the Sum of One Thousand Livres French Money , which I would have paid him with my Blood for a Service he has done me , which I will explain when I shall have the honour to assure you , that I am with the utmost Attachment , SIR , Your most humble , and most obedient Servant , To Mr. du Lisle , at the Hague in Holland . De Vic . pour Mil Liure argens de franse Monsieur PArsette Seul lettre dechange il vous plaira payer an porteur'de cette presente la Somme de Mil Liure Argen defrence que je luy aurois paier de mon Sens pour un Service uil marendueue je vous espliqueres lonque jayray honneur de vous assurer que je Suis avec toute latachement possible . Monsieur Votre tres bumble & tres abeissent Seruiteur a Monsieur Monsieur du Lisle a la Hay en oulande De Vic . Jane Gibbons . On Monday the 10th of July , about 8 at Night , the Prisoners and a Servant came to my House with a Trunk , and asked if I had any Lodgings to Let ? I told them , yes , and so they went up Stairs directly . When Mr. Elton was gone to Tun-bridge , they desir 'd to be lodg 'd in his Room . I told them I expected first to be paid what they ow 'd me ; they said , I should have it on Monday . So I let them go in , and on Monday I ask 'd them again for the Money , and they desir 'd me to stay , but till Mr. Cray went out to fetch it . Then Mr. Cray went out , and when he came in again they paid me . Mr. Elton had left his Trunk in his Dressing-Room ; and soon after they had paid me , their Man came , and asked me , if I had got the Key of that Trunk , for , says he , My Masters are packing up some rich lac 'd Cloaths , and I know they have none such of their own . So I went and searched the Prisoners Trunk , while they stood by , and there I found these two Suits of lac 'd Cloaths that are Mr. Elton 's . Lord , bless me , says I , you have ruin 'd me ; and with that they thrust several Things into their own Trunk , and went away directly , and I was so surpriz 'd , and ready to sink with the fright , that I had not power to stop them . They went in a Hackney Coach . P. Cray . Did I not give you the Key of my Trunk as soon as you ask 'd for it ? Mrs. Gibbons . Yes . P. Cray . And when you open 'd the Trunk , and I saw the Cloaths , I said , the Marquis has put up these Cloaths , and they belong to Mr. Elton . Mrs. Gibbons . You said the Marquis had taken care of Mr. Elton 's Cloaths , and I said , Yes , finely , in your own Trunk . Tho Groom . I was Servant to the Prisoners occasionally . As I came into the Room , Mr. Cray was packing up some Cloaths in the Trunk that belong 'd to both the Prisoners ; I did not then see what Cloaths they were , because they were in the Trunk , and he was pressing them down to make the Trunk lock , when I came in ; but before he had quite done , he was call 'd out , and Mr. Maccarty and I were left in the Room . I wonder , says Mr. Maccarty , that Mrs. Gibbons should be so pressing upon these Gentlemen for a little Money , when they must be Persons of Worth by their having such rich Cloaths in their Trunk . I knew they had no such Cloaths of their own , and therefore I acquainted Mrs. Gibbons with it . Mr. Maccarty . I knew Mr. Cray at Paris . he came to me on Monday Morning , and told me he was injur 'd . I gave him advice as a Surgeon ; after which he told me , that the Marquis was in trouble , and wanted to dispose of a Diamond Ring . We went in the Marquis 's Chariot to Mr. Darker 's , a Jeweller in the Strand ; there we were offer 'd 34 l. for the Ring , tho ' we were told , it would have been worth 60 l. if it had been of a clearer Water . We came back to the Marquis , and Cray told him that he could get but 34l . Then I must take it , says the Marquis , tho ' that Ring , and another little one cost me 2000 Livres ( which is about 100 l. Sterling ) I know the Bailiffs are waiting for me , and that 34 l. may clear me of my present trouble , and serve me till I have Remittances . Court . Where is this Ring ? Mr. Burrow . I bought it of Mr. Darker . Court . Produce it . Burrow . I forgot to bring it . Justice De Veil . I seal 'd it up , and gave him strict Orders to bring it to Court ; but I suppose they are afraid the right Owner should have it again , for it was 5 or 6 Hours before I could bring 'em to produce it . Court to Burrow . Fetch it immediately , or I 'll commit you . Burrow . I will , my Lord . [ Whispers a Friend . ] A Witness . Here 's the Ring , my Lord . Court . Who gave it you ? Witness . Mr. Burrow , for fear he should lose it . Court . How long have you had it ? Witness . About an Hour . Mr. Burrow . This is the Ring I bought of Mr. Darker for 40 l. and he has my Note for the Money . Mr. Maccarty . This is the Ring that Mr. Cray sold to Mr. Darker 's Man for 34 l. Mr. Elton . This is the Ring 1 lost out of my Trunk . I bought it about 4 Years ago of Mr. Sharack . Mr. Sharack . I sold this Ring to Mr. Elton for 60 Guineas . De Vic . Mr. Maccarty brought me word , that he could get but 32 Guineas for the Ring , and I consented to sell it for that ; but I never said that it cost 2000 Livres . Mr. Alexander . At Mr. Elton 's Desire I went to Paris to enquire of Mr. Cray 's Character . I met with his Aunt , Madam Estril , and some of his Acquaintance , who seem 'd very much surpriz 'd to hear of his Misfortune . They told me , that he had been Page to the Queen of Spain ; in general , I heard no ill of him . The Jury found them both Guilty . Death . 52. John Maine , Taylor , was indicted for receiving one Velvet Housing for a Horse embroider 'd with Gold , value 25 l. 1 pair of Velvet Pistol Cases embroider 'd with Gold , value 5 l. 3 Silk Handkerchiefs , 3 Cambrick Handkerchief , and 3 pair of thread Stockings , the Goods of John Elton , Esq ; knowing them to stolen ( by Lewis de Vic and Paul Cray , who were convicted at this Court on Wednesday last , of stealing those and other Goods ) July 24 . Jane Gibbons . On Monday July 24. about 7 in the Evening , the Prisoner came to my House , and asked where the French Gentlemen ( De Vic and Cray ) were . I told him they robb 'd Mr. Elton 's Trunk , and had been go ne 2 or 3 Hours . Then . Madam , says he , I believe I know where to find them , and I do n't doubt but I can take them . And if you should take them , say I , for God 's Sake send me word . He went away , and I saw no more of him that Night . I met him a few Days after in Bond-street ; and , says he , Mr. Elton has been no Loser by the Frenchmen ; for I can prove that he has rather got 2 or three Guineas . Prisoner . When you told me that Mr. Elton had been robb 'd , did you mention the Particulars he had lost ? Did you name any Housing , or Pistol Case ? Gibbons . No , but I said I believ 'd he had lost Jewels . Prisoner . Had you then given any Information before a Magistrate ? Gibbons . No . Prisoner . Did you not say that you had got all the Goods again ? Gibbons . No , I said I had got 2 Suits of laced Cloaths again , but I fear 'd the Jewels were gone . Prisoner . I said , how came you to let the Men go , and you said , because you had got all the Things again . Gibbons . I said no such thing , for I let them go , because I was in such a fright , that I was not able to stop them . Henry Hollis . ( a Kinsman and Servant to Mrs. Gibbons ) When the Prisoner came in to enquire for De Vic and Cray , Mrs. Gibbons told him they had stolen Mr. Elton 's Cloaths , and were run away , God damn them , says he , I 'll soon have them . The Prisoner employed Sherard the Officer , who arrested Paul Cray between 8 and 9 at Night . I was then present , and desired the Prisoner to charge Cray with a Felony . He told me I had no Business with it ; but it I would go and tell Mrs. Gibbons , that he was taken , she might come and charge him , if she thought fit . I went to tell her , and when I returned , they were gone from the Place where I left them , which was in Chandois-street , and I could not find them that Night . Next Morning I heard that he had let Cray go again . I and William Groom and another went to his House to enquire why he suffer 'd him to escape , who , said he , Self-Preservation is the first Law of Nature . I have got my Coat again , and 2 Guineas , which would all have been lost , if he had been brought to a Trial , and Convicted . Sherrard . I arrested Cray at the Prisoner 's Suit for 17 l. 16 s. at a Coffehouse facing the Bagnio . Says Cray in broken English . Vel mine dear Shile , vare is dis Master Taylore ? I vill pay him presaant . I call 'd the Prisoner in , he spoke with Cray , and then said to me , let 's go to another Place , and I shall get Satisfaction . We took Coach and drove to the King 's Arms Tavern in New Bond Street ; there we met with a Gentleman in Black ; the Prisoner and that Gentleman went out together ( leaving me with Cray ) and came in again with a Porter , who brought a Trunk . The Prisoner then desir 'd me to step out with him , which I did . He gave me a Guinea and a half for my Trouble , and told me that he had made it up , that he had got the Suit of Cloaths back which he had made for Cray , and 2 Guineas , besides a Silver-hilted Sword ( which I had taken from Cray for fear of Mischief ) and an old Velvet Furniture embroidered with Gold , which ( he said ) was not of much Value . So I left them between 9 and 10 at Night . Mr. Duchire . About 8 o'Clock on Monday Night , 2 Gentlemen came in a Coach to Conduit-Street Coffee-house by Hanover Square , and brought a Portmanteau , and a Brace of Pistols with them . They supt together , left the Portmanteau , and went out , and when they came back again , they sent for a Porter , and took the Portmanteau away . - Wilson , Porter . Mr. Duchire call 'd me to carry a Portmanteau to the King 's Arms Tavern in New Bond-Street . I went , and a Gentleman in Black walked along with me , but I saw no body else with him all the way . Daniel Stevenson . I lived with Mr. Elton ; and the Day we came from the Wells , he sent me to tell the Prisoner , that he would speak with him . I asked the Prisoner if he had heard of De Vic and Cray . He said he believed he knew where they were , and would help to take them up ; for he was 15 l. out of Pocket by a Suit of Cloaths he had sold to one of them . Prisoner . Did I not say I would tell your Master where the things were ? Stevenson . No , you said you thought you could tell him where the Men were . Mr. Elton . On Thursday Morning about 8 , I came home from the Wells . Mrs. Gibbons having acquainted me with the Robbery , told me that the Prisoner came in 2 or 3 Hours after , and she inform 'd him of it ; and he swore , God damn them , he 'd have them , and that she believ 'd he knew where they were . I sent my Man to the Prisoner 's House in the Strand . In the mean time Mr. Watson the Serjeant came in , and said he had got a Letter from De Vic , who with Cray was then at Gravesend . While we were talking , the Prisoner came in trembling , and said , Are you the Gentleman that has been robb 'd ? Dogs ! Rogues ! Villains ! Damn them ! And pray , Sir , what have you lost ? I told him several things , and among them a Velvet embroidered Housing ; says he , I believe I can help you to the Housing . I was just upon taking Coach for Gravesend , and as I was going out , I said I had lost some Cambrick Handkerchiefs . When I came to Gravesend , I put up at the Swan , and enquired after De Vic and Cray . The Landlord told me that they had been committed to the Care of the Constable ; but as no Body came to accuse them , they were left at their Liberty to walk about the Town . I happen 'd to see them just as they were coming down Stairs . Cray gave me the Key of his Trunk , and said , Your Housing is at Mr. Maine 's and your Ring at Mr. Darker 's . I brought them up in the Yatcht ; and as soon as I came home , my Maid told me , that the Prisoner sent home my Housings in about an Hour after I was gone . I was advised to carry De Vic and Cray before a Magistrate directly ; but they being fatigued with their Journey , were laid down upon my Bed ; and I said , Let the poor Devils sleep , for they have had but little rest this Week . And they slept 5 Hours . When I went before Justice De Veil , I sent for the Prisoner to bring the Box with the Handkerchiefs , but he would not come till the Justice threatened to send a Warrant for him ; but when he did come he brought the Cambrick Handkerchiefs with him , and said , How do you know these to be yours ? I know them by the Marks , says I , and I do n't know but you may have been an Accessary in helping the Men off , and at a proper Opportunity I shall take Notice of you . God damn you , says he , what do you mean by that ? I have not yet got sufficient Evidence , says I , but when I have I shall answer you in another place . Aye , God damn you , says he , and I shall make an Example of you for scandalizing me . I told him I was not to be frighted by his Menaces , and so we parted . Prisoner . Did you not thank me for returning your Housings ? Elton . Yes ; but I did not then know what Sherrard could swear . Catherine Owen . The Prisoner brought home the Housings that Day Mr. Elton went to Gravesend . The Prisoner 's Defence . Peter Malarte . The Morning Mr. Elton came to Town , I was at his Lodgings , and the Prisoner was there , and they had some talk about the Housings as if they were found , I do n't remember the particulars ; but while they were in Discourse , one Watson came in , brought word that De Vic , the Frenchman , and Paul Cray the Irishman were taken , and and brought to Gravesend ; the Prisoner seemed to be pleased at hearing the News . Court . Did they talk of the Housings being found before Watson came in ? Malarte . I think they did . Mr. Elton . I suppose this is the Gentleman who brought the Letter that Mrs. Gibbons said was to be left for me at the Hay-Market . Mr. Malarte . Yes , I brought it . Court . When you received this Furniture of De Vic and Cray , did you believe it to be theirs ? Prisoner . Yes . Court , You made a Suit of Cloaths for Cray , you arrested him for the money , he returned you the same Cloaths , when he had had but a few Days , and gave you . Guineas , a Silver-hilted Sword , and that Housings and Pistol-Cases , which are valued at 30 l. Did you receive all this in Satisfaction for a Debt of but between 16 and 17 Prisoner . No , I was to sell the Goods and return him the Overplus . Court . But you had these Things in your Possession when Mr. Elton 's Man Daniel Stevenson came to you , and yet you could tell him that you should be a loser by De Vic and Cray . Prisoner . That was , if his Master should claim the Housings ; for the two Guineas would not make me Recompence for having a rich Suit turn 'd upon my Hands . Court . Sherrard swears that you told him these Housings were old Things of little value . Pris . I never told him any such thing . Court . What might those Housings and Cases cost you Mr. Elton ? Mr. Elton . I am not certain ; they were a Present made me by my Grand-fathers : but I believe they cost about 60 Guineas . William Carr . I was present when the Prisoner received those Housings of De Vic and Cray , and they agreed that he should sell them , and return the Overplus ; and I was Witness to the Note that was then drawn on that Account . Francis Swinton . I was before Justice De Veil when the Prisoner and Mr. Elton were there ; the Prisoner gave Information of some Handkerchiefs and Caps which he had taken out of De Vic 's Portmanteau ; says the Prosecutor , Where are they ? Why are they not here ? To which the Prisoner answer 'd in a familiar manner , if you will go with me I 'll fetch them . At this the Prosecutor was affronted , and said , if you receive stolen Goods , you ought to bring them here ; and the Prisoner answer 'd , if you be so angry you may fetch 'em your self , and so went out ; when he was gone , the Prosecutor told the Justice , that he believ 'd the Prisoner had assisted De Vic and Cray to make their escape , by helping them to a Boat . When the Prisoner came in again , I told him what the Prosecutor had insinuated , upon which they quarrell 'd . John Salt . I heard Mr. Elton say , If the Prisoner had not been rude to me , I had not Prosecuted him , but his impertinent Behaviour brought it upon him . A great Number of Witnesses appear 'd to the Prisoner 's Character , and the Jury acquitted him . 53 , Peter Buck , of St. Dunstans in the West , was indicted for assaulting Joseph Fisher , on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Metal Box , value 6 d. and a Holland Handkerchief , value 6d . May 24 . Joseph Fisher . On the 24th of May , between 10 and 11 at Night , as I and another Man who is now in Wiltshire , were going along Chancery-Lane , we were stopt by the Prisoner and another , over-against the King 's Head Back-door . They demanded my Money , and swore if I did not deliver , they would knock my Brains out ; and presently the Prisoner knock 'd me down , and took away my Snuff-Box , and my Handkerchief . I had seen the Prisoner before , but did not know him by Name . Court . What was that Snuff-Box worth ? Fisher . I believe it cost a Guinea . I valu 'd it at 15 s. before the Justice . Court . And how came you to value it but at 6 d. now ? Fisher . I did not know but it might be over-valu 'd at 15 s. Court . Why did you not prosecute before ? Fisher . He was admitted to be an Evidence last Sessions , and therefore I thought he could not be try 'd ; but hearing afterwards that he had not put this Robbery into his Information , I was told , that he might still be prosecuted for it . Catherine Pember , * The Prisoner is my Brother . One Day since last Sessions , when my Brother went to get Bail , the Prosecutor and Lawyer Grimes call 'd on me , and Lawyer Grimes said , If you would save your Brother 's Life , you must come down to me . Come down , says I. for what ? Why , says he , pointing to the Prosecutor , Here 's a Man that will swear a Robbery against him . Well , says I , what is your demand ? Why , says the Lawyer , you must pay me a Debt ( I think it was about 3 l. ) that your Brother owes me , and give me something for a pair of Gloves , and 2 Guineas to this Man , the Prosecutor . Says I to the Prosecutor , Do you know my Brother ? Yes , says he , I have known him a long Time ; and why did you not prosecute him before ? says I . Why , says he , because I was out of Town ( tho ' now he pretends , that it was because my Brother was an Evidence ) but says he , if you 'll satisfy Lawyer Grimes , and give me 2 Guineas , I 'll make it up . And but last Week , Lawyer Grimes got a Guinea of me , at the Vine Tavern to give the Prosecutor ; and last Night I was drinking with the Prosecutor at the Ship , and he own 'd , that he had that Guinea of the Lawyer ; and then he went out and left me the Reckoning to pay . And Lawyer Grimes told me to Day , that - * On Monday , Peter Buck having some Words with his Sister , he threw a Pot at her , and cut her Nose ( almost ) off . Court . Who is this Lawyer Grimes ? Kate Pember . He calls himself Lawyer ; but he 's a Coach-maker ( or a Coach-carver ) by Trade , and solicits in this Court . Anne Buck . The Prosecutor was with me 3 or 4 times in Bartholomew-Fair . He told me that the Bill was found Ignorance , and that he knew nothing of my Brother , till Lawyer Grimes shew 'd him which was he ; and afterwards they sent for me to Lawyer Grimes , and we drank 3 Bowls of Punch , which I was forc 'd to pay for . Prosecutor . I was not with you at all in the Fair . Hannah Nicholson . Last Wednesday Night I went to Nan Buck in the Fair , and the Prosecutor was there , and I heard him say , God forgive me , I have sworn that against your Brother that I ca n't stand to ; but Lawyer Grimes put me upon it . I am out of Pocket , I wish you would lend me half a Crown ; and so she did . Court . Where is this Lawyer Grimes ? Nicholson . We left him at the Baptist-Head , but he charg 'd us not to send for him . Court . Let an Officer bring him into Court directly . Ann Bond . On Wednesday Night , I heard the Prosecutor say , that Peter Buck was not the Man , and that he was sorry for what he had done ; but it was what Lawyer Grimes had put him upon . And last Night I heard him say the same , and that he could not swear against the Prisoner for the World . Jane Jones . I live hard by Mr. Brock [ Brogdon Poplet , a Bailiff ] who keeps an Alehouse in Drury-Lane . And about a Month ago , as I was throwing some Suds into the Street , the Prosecutor and Nan Buck came out of Brock 's House ; and I heard the Prosecutor say to her , I have nothing to say to him , I ca n't swear it against him , but Mr. Grimes has something of a Debt to demand of him , and if you 'll satisfy that , I believe Matters will be made easy . And but a little while ago , Lawyer Grimes came into the Ship Alehouse , and said , Buck never robb 'd him , he 's a Rogue ; but take no Notice of me that I said so . Lawyer Grimes being brought in by an Officer , the Court reprimanded him , and forbid him ever to Practice in that Court for the future . Lawyer Grimes , [ alias John Graham . ] My Lord , I attended here as Evidence on the Trials of Joseph Powis and Ann Forster . A Juryman . My Lord , we have taken Notice of his being very busy with the Witnesses all this Sessions . Robert Nash . He makes it his Business to set People together by the Ears , and soment Law-Suits . I my self paid him not long ago 45 l. for an Acquaintance of mine , upon no other Account than giving a Slap of the Face to a Girl , who came to his Shop and abus 'd him . A Juryman 's Wife . Lawyer Grimes keeps a publick Baudy-House in Church-Yard-Alley , between Fetter-Lane and Cursitor's-Alley . Court . Those who know these Things should indict him as a common Barretor , and for keeping a common Baudy-House . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . On the Monday following , Mary Tompson , a Juryman 's Wife , inform 'd the Court upon Oath , That coming to the Sessions-House to see for her Husband , she met with Lawyer Grimes at the Door , who told her , that her Husband was gone in ; and that then taking her a little aside , he said , Here 's Henry Davis , a Boy , to be try 'd for Felony and Burglary ; whisper your Husband to tell the rest of the Jury , that if they will find the Boy guilty of the Indictment , they shall have two Guineas a-piece . Upon this the Court immediately granted a Warrant for apprehending the Lawyer . 54. Henry Newbole was indicted for stealing a Quilt , the Goods of John Pickey , August 1 . Guilty 10 d.

Christopher Candy and William White were indicted for stealing a Bag and seven Moidores , 3 half Moidores , four broad Pieces , 2 quarter broad Pieces , and 4 s. the Goods and Money of Roger Stephens , in his House , Sept. 1 . William Mander . The Prisoner came into my Master 's Shop in Thames-street , on pretence of buying a Glocester Cheese . They chose one ; we agreed upon the Price , and White gave me a Guinea to change . There not being Silver enough in the Till , I went to the Counting house , and pull 'd out a Drawer , in which were 3 Bags of Money , and White followed me . I took out some Silver , and laid it on the Table ; but before I had told out 15 s. I mist one of the Bags . I call 'd to the 'Prentice in the Shop , and said , was not here three Bags ? He answer 'd , Yes . Upon which White in a Harry cry 'd , Give me Change give me my Change Candy , who stood at the Door , calld out White , and said , Come along , what do you stay for ? And presently White , before I could stop him , hurried to Candy , and they both run out of the Shop together , without taking either the Cheese , or the Change , or the Guinea . I pursued them , and in the middle of Martin 's Lane I stopp 'd Candy . He struck me 2 or 3 times , and swore , if I did not let him go , he would knock m e down , but I brought him back to the Shop . Thomas Marshall . Between 5 and 6 on Friday Night , as I was going down Martin 's Lane , I found a Bag . And seeing a Crowd in Thames-street at the bottom of the Lane , I went to see what was the matter , and they told me , that 2 Men were going before the Justice for stealing a Bag of Money . I 'll be bang 'd , says I , if it is not the Bag that I found . So I gave it to my Master Mitchell , and he opened it , and I saw some broad Pieces , and Moidores , and Silver in it . John Mitchell . My man brought me the Bag , and said he had found it . I told out the Money before him , and there were 7 Moidores , 3 half Moidores , 2 Pieces of 5 s. 9 d. 3 s. and 2 Sixpences , and a little Note , in which the Sum was set down , 16 l. 17 s. Mr. Stevens . I put that Note and 16 l. 17 s. in the Bag , and left it in my Drawer . James Pilstrong , Mrs. Stevens 's Apprentice . When William Mander call 'd to me , and asked if there were not 3 Bags in the drawer ; and I answered , Yes . He look 'd in White 's Face , and said , There was 3 Bags . And White said 3 times , Give me my Change . Candy stood at the Door , and bid him come away . So they run away together , without the Cheese , or the Change , or the Guinea . Tho Dowler . I know Mr. Smith , Mr. White I would say . I am a Fruiterer , I live in Westminster . I was coming from Tower Hill , along with Charles Smith my next Door Neighbour ; and turning up Martin 's Lane , I saw a Man in a dark Waistcoat running in a Hurry up the Hill after Mr. Candy . And he in the dark Waistcoat dropt something from his Breast ; says I , Have you lost any thing ? Yes , says he , and went forward ; and a spare Man that followed him stoop 'd down , and took up a Bag . Then says Candy to me , Did you see me run in any thing in Life ? No , says I . So he took down my Name , and subpoened me . The Bag was taken up before Candy was stopp 'd . Charles Smith . I am a Barber , I live at Samerset-House . Court . Why , Dowler says that he lives in Westminster , and that you are his next Door Neighbour . Smith . It was formerly that we were next Door Neighbours : But as I was going along with him , I saw a young Man in a dark Waistcoat run up Martin 's Lane , and drop something , and another Man took it up in a few Minutes . I did not see Candy above a Minute before he was taken , and then he looked about , and said , Did any Body see me run ? So he took several Peoples Names , and mine among the rest . The People were not gone away before the Bag was taken up . Marshall again . They were gone quite into Thames-Street , at the bottom of the Lane . I found it on a Plank between two Posts .

See summary . ] 65. Benjamin Loveday , alias Lowder , was indicted for that he being an ill-dispos 'd Person , and greedy of filthy Lucre , did ( after the first Day of June , 1723 , that is to say ) on the 13th of July last , send to Charles Fairchild a Letter without Name , being only sign 'd T. M. bearing Date July 11 , 1732 , demanding 20 Guineas , and threatning to burn his House if the Money was not sent as directed . Charles Fairchild . I received a Letter by the Penny-Post , dated June 7 . 1732 , with a Postscript dated June 8 , demanding 20 Guineas to be left under a Tree behind Yeates 's Booth in Moorfields , and threatening to fire my House if the Demand was not comply 'd with . On the 13th of July , about 2 in the Afternoon , this Boy , Walter Cooper , brought another Letter to the same Purpose , dated July 11 . 1732 , and sign 'd T. M. The Boy was stopt . He said , he had it from a Man in his own Hair , a brown Frock or Coat , with a speckled Handkerchief about his Neck , who met him in Queen-street , and promis 'd to give him a Penny to carry it to my House . By this Description we found the Prisoner in less than half an Hour , at a Brandy-shop hard by . We took up 3 or 4 0other suspicious Fellows , but the Boy immediately fix 'd upon the Prisoner . Walter Cooper . On the 13th of July , about 2 in the Afternoon , as I was going along on one Side of Queen-street , the Prisoner was walking on the other . He cross 'd the Way towards me , and said , C me hither my Lad ; Carry this Letter over the Way , and I 'll give you a Penny . I bid him give me the Money first . No , says he , I 'll wait here for you , and you shall have it as soon as ever you come back . So I carried it ; and as soon as I came from the Door I look 'd for him , but he was gone from the Place where I left him . Mr. Fairchild call 'd me back , and ask 'd me from whom I had the Letter ? I describ 'd the Prisoner to him , and they found him in less than half an Hour , and brought him to me at Mr. Fairchild 's House , and I knew him again as soon as ever I saw him . This is the same Letter that he gave to me . Mr. Fairchild . And it is the same Letter that the Boy brought . I have mark 'd it . William Clark , Constable . Mr. Fairchild told me , that he had receiv 'd another threat ening Letter , and had stopt the Boy that brought it . The Boy described the Prisoner to wear his own Hair , a brown Coat , and a speckled Handkerchief . We found the Prisoner sitting between 2 Women at the Brandy-show ; he had a white Wig on then . I took up 3 or 4 other loose Fellows , and carried 'em to the Boy ; he said , none of those was the Man ; but as soon as I shew 'd him the Prisoner , he cry 'd , This is he , this is the right . Are not you a cheating Rogue ? You promised me a Penny for carrying the Letter , but you run away , and never paid me : You had your own dark Hair on then , tho ' now you have got a Wig . I took off the Prisoner 's Wig , and found that he had a shock dark Head of Hair . After the Prisoner was committed to Newgate , the Brandyman , whose House he had frequented , sent me Word , that the Prisoner wanted to speak with me . I went to him in the Prison , and he said , I own I gave the Boy the Letter , but I had it from one Tom Rowly , who set by me in the Brandy-shop when I was taken , and I was to have Six Pence for carrying it . You may find Rowly at Bailey 's Brandy-shop in Shug-Lane in the Day time ; or asleep upon the Steps in Covent-Garden about 11 at Night . We took up Rowly , and he was committed to Newgate . Charles Fairchild . While the Prisoner was in Newgate I receiv 'd another Letter by the Penny Post , dated July 20 . 1732 ; all the Letters appear to be of the same Hand Writing . The second which the Boy brought refers to the first , and the last refers to the other two . Court . Read the Letters . Clerk . Reads .

William Flemming was indicted for assaulting Thomas Oulton on the High-way , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 3 s. in the Parish of St. George in Middlesex , August 5 . Thomas Oulton . About 8 at Night , I was sitting on my Coach-Box at Thread-needle-Point , by Stock's-Market . The Prisoner and another looked up at me as they past by ; and returning in a little time , looked at me again ; I ply 'd them . They asked what I 'd have to St. Katharine 's . I told them 18 d. Come down Cockes , says Flemming , we 'll give it you . So I drove them to the lower End of the Minories , and then they call 'd to me to drive to old Gravel Lane . When I came to the End of the Lane , they call 'd again , and bid me drive to the Magpy Ale-house in that Lane . I did not like my Chaps , for I was afraid ( by their bidding me drive from one Place to another ) that they wanted an Opportunity of jumping out of the Coach , and bilking me of my Fair . I watch 'd them , and at the Magpy Door I stopp 'd and open 'd the Coach , the Prisoner pretended to be drunk and asleep ; we got him up , he staggar 'd against a Post , and stood with one Hand in his Pocket , and the other at his Codpiece , as if he was going to piss . I demanded my Money ; they said ; they wanted something from their Aunts , who lived down farther , but did not care that she should see them ; and if I would go and fetch it , they would shew me the Door , and if I did not go they could not pay me . I left my Coach , and went with them to the lower End of Farthing I there they run into a little Ground-Room , in which I saw nothing but a Counter , a Case Knife , and 2 Women . One of the Women said to the Prisoner , Dear Billy , I am glad to see you ; but he up with the Case Knife , and holding it to her , felt a damning her , and asked if she had no Money ? She told him , No ; but if he would go to such an Ale-house , she would make him drink . So they went through several bye Alleys , and he sell a singing a Song of , The Miller and the High-way-Man , till we came to the end of King-street in old Gravel-Lane , and there he knock 'd an Oyster-Woman down , and run into an Ale-house among some Whores , and swore he would dance a Horn-pipe ; but he and the other Man soon came out again , and went along Green-Bank and Brew-house-Lane . I followed him at 2 or 3 Yards Distance . The Prisoner came back to me , and said , Damn my Eyes , what do you follow me for ? I told him I was the Coachman , and only followed him for my Money ; and if he would pay me , I should soon leave him . Damn your Eyes , says he , what Money have you about you ? I told him 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d. Damn my Eyes then , says he , deliver . So I pulled it out of my Pocket , and he took it out of my Hand , and then he damn 'd his Eyes again , and took me a knock , and bid me go that way . So away I run to the bottom of old Gravel-Lane , there I met 2 Sailors , and told them I had been robb 'd , but they would not follow him . Then I went to the Oyster-Woman that he had knock 'd down , and asked her , if she knew who it was that gave her a knock , and she said , Yes , very well , it was Will . Flemming . I went back to my Coach at the Magpy Door , and the Landlord told me that he knew the Prisoner . Court . Did he threaten you before he took your Money ? Oulton . He damn 'd his Eyes , and said , he would knock my Brains out , if I did not deliver ; but he did not strike me till after he had my Money . The little Man that was with him , said , Do n't serve him so Will . do n't rob him . Prisoner . Jo . Williams the Thief-Catcher took me up , and he afterwards brought the Prosecutor to see me in the new Goal , and said to him ( pointing to me ) That 's the Man . Oulton . No Soul shew 'd him to me , I pick 'd him out my self from among a great many Prisoners in the Yard , tho ' he had changed his Cloaths . Prisoner . It 's a likely story indeed , that I should go to rob a Hackney Coachman of 3 s. the very Day that I came out of Newgate ! why did he not bring the Oyster-Woman to prove that I was there . Oulton . I did not think there was any need of it . John Lee . I am a Hackney Coachman too . I was standing at the Top of old Gravel Lane , when the Prosecutor stopp 'd and came off his Box , and asked me for the Magpy Alehouse . I directed him . I wish , says he , you would go with me , for I have a couple of loose Chaps , who , I am afraid , will bilk me . So I got on the Coach-Box , and he got up behind . We stopp 'd at the Magpy , he let them out , and one of them pretended to be drunk . It was so dark , that I could not see their faces , but one of them was a little Man . They had some Words about the Fare . The Prosecutor told me he was going down with them to get his Money , and desired me to mind his Coach the while . He returned in half an Hour , and said he had been robb 'd of 3 s. Anne Davis . I live at the Magpye . We were at Supper when the Coach stopp 'd ; I went out with a Candle , and one of the Men in the Coach said , Damn you Bitch , what do you bring a Candle for ? we want no Light . When they came out , one of them said to the Coachman , you must go down with us , or else we can not pay you , He went , and came back in half an Hour , and said he had been robb 'd . I ca n't swear to the Prisoner 's Face . Prisoner . I never saw the Prosecutor , nor he me till I was taken up ; but Jo Williams hearing I was out , came to me , and swore he would not give me a Week before he had me in again . He offered 5 Guineas to Will . James the Drawer to swear against me , and afterwards he procured this Prosecutor , who has as bad a Character as my self , by what I have heard among his Brother Coachmen . Robert Sloper . I heard Cartwright ( who belongs to the Burough Counter ) says that he heard a Man proffer 5 l. to another to swear the Fact . John Hooper the Executioner . I heard Cartwright and Kurwls say so . Court . What they said is no Evidence , they should have been here to have sworn it . Prisoner . Jo Williams told me in New Prison , that he would have me hang 'd , guilty or not . Jo Williams . I was with him in New Prison 5 or 6 Weeks ago , and he shewed me his Effigies ( that he had drawn upon the Wall ) hanging in Chains , with his Name over it . I told him I thought it was very presumptuous to make a Jest of such Things , for he did not know how soon he might come to such an End in Earnest . Damn my Eyes , says he , if I do but live to see Bartholomew Fair , and Southwark Fair over , I do n't care if I am bang 'd . After he got out of Prison , it was talked about , that he had robb 'd a Coachman . Willi . James the Drawer told me of it . We saw the Prisoner cross the Water , and we followed him to Horsly-Down , then we made a Push at him . He clap 'd his Hand to his Pocket ; but not finding a Pistol readily , he cry 'd , Damn my Eyes , am I mistaken . We seiz 'd him , and all the Way he went , he swore , Damn his Eyes he was a Street Robber ; and when we carried him before the Justices at Margaret 's Hill , he damn 'd their Eyes too , and call 'd them Sons of Whores . Court . Had you seen the Prosecutor before you took the Prisoner ? Williams . No . Court . And how came you to take him up upon such a random Report ? Williams . It was reported by a 100 Coachmen ; it was general Talk among them . Prisoner . This Fellow makes a Trade of taking up People ; he took up 6 this Sessions , and he took up County Bob . Williams . But I got nothing by the Bargain . Prisoner . Did you not take up 2 People at Kingston , and procure Witnesses to swear against them . Williams . I own I did assist in taking those People . Prisoner . Yes , and when you brought the Prosecutor to see me in Prison , you pointed with your Finger , and said , that 's the Man . Oulton . Williams and others were with me in the Prison , but no Body told me which was you , for I look 'd over the Hatch , and pointed you out my self . The Jury found him guilty . Death . 85. John Ashford was indicted for committing the unnatural Sin of Sodomy , by feloniously , wickedly , devilishly , and against the Order of Nature , assaulting and carnally knowing William Curtis , a Boy about the Age of 20 Years , on the 29th of September , in the 4th Year of the King . William Curtis . I came out of the Country , and went to live at Mr. Nutt 's , a Printer in the Old Bailey , at Michaelmas 1728 , and in about six Months afterwards the Prisoner came to live there . We say together . He had not been there above a Month or 6 Weeks , before he began to kiss me , and call me his dear Billy , and to meddle with my Privy Parts , and gave me Money not to speak of it . One Night he made an Attempt upon me , but I got out of Bed , and left the Tail of my Shirt in his Hand . My Mother mended the Shirt , but I did not tell her how it came to be torn . He continued to solicit me ; he gave me more Money , and told me that he 'd make me Heir to a small Estate that would come to him after his Mother 's death , and cut his Brother off with a Shilling . At last , in about 3 Month 's Time , he over-persuaded me to let him bugger me . And after that , he did it frequently while I continued at Mr. Nutt 's , which was till August last . Court . And how long was it before you complained of this ? Curtis . I told Hannah Urwin something of it about Half a Year after he first did it , and she talk 'd to him about it : And in July last I made my Information and Confession before Sir John Gonson , and Justice De Veil . Court . And why did you conceal such filthy Practices so long ? Curtis . I was an ignorant Country Lad , and did not know the Greatness of the Crime ; and then he allow 'd me 3 s. a Week constantly , besides Presents that he made me at other Times . He gave me last Easter these Cloaths that I have on now , they were made out of one of his Suits , and he paid Halfa Guinea for altering them . He paid 10 s. 6 d. that I ow 'd at one Toyshop , and 3 s. at another . Court . How came you to leave Mr. Nutt 's Service . Curtis . I was got acquainted with men that followed such Kind of Practices , as Bishop , Cadogan , and Catton , and used to lye out o'Nights , and so we parted by Consent . Court . Have you never demanded any money of the Prisoner since you were turn 'd away from Mr. Nutt 's ? Curtis . No : He always gave it me without asking . He lately gave me 2 s. at a Coffee-house , and 1 s. in Bridewell . The last Time he gave me money , was last Sunday was Sev'n-night . Prisoner . I own I gave him a Shilling in Bridewell , but I gave it him publickly ; and as for the 3 s. a Week , 't is as false as God is true . Curtis . No , you gave me the Shilling in Bridewell privately . Prisoner . When you made your Information upon Oath before Sir John Gonson , and Justice De Veil , did you mention me ? Curtis . No . Justice De Veil . He said upon his Oath , that those men whom he had named in his Information , were all the men that he knew to be concerned in Sodomitical Practices . And the Prisoner 's Name was not at all mentioned in that Information . Court . And so you forswore yourself ? Curtis . Yes . Court . Why ? Curtis . Because he gave me money , and cry 'd and begg 'd me not to discover him ; and promised if I did not , he would stand by me as long as he lived . Court . And you really perjured yourself to save him . Curtis . Yes , I did . Court . After such a Confession , I do n't see how the Jury can credit any thing you say . But how happen 'd it that you impeach 'd the Prisoner at last ? Curtis . I could not be easy in my Conscience till I had done it . Prisoner . I believe you had another Reason . Did not you fear that I should be an Evidence against your Character in the Trial of Catton and Bishop at Hicks 's Hall for such Practices . Curtis . Yes , you did as much as threaten it , and I was obliged to do what I did in my own Defence . Mrs. Atkins . I keep Gray's-Inn Coffee house . Curtis having ran away , was brought to my House as soon as he was found . The Prisoner came to Breakfast with him every Day , and they talked privately together . I examin 'd the Boy , and he told me the Prisoner had been the ruin of him , by allowing him Pocket-money , and promising to cut his Brother off with a Shilling . He said , that the Prisoner had given him Cloaths too , and had order 'd the Barber to make him a Wig , and that they were to go over Sea together . Before the Prisoner came , the Boy had no Money , but I saw him have a Shilling after the Prisoner was gone . The Boy did not tell me any thing of the Crime , but I guess ' at it . Prisoner . On what Day was the Boy brought to your House ? Atkins . On Thursday , and you came next Day with several more . Prisoner . And what did I bring him ? Atkins . You brought some Linen from his Cousin , Mr. Nevill , and some Books . Prisoner . What Books ? Atkins . The Whole Duty of Man , which I thought it would have been well if you had practised . Then there was Wake 's Exposition of the Church Catechism , and Stanhope 's Christian Pattern . Mrs. Owen . The Prisoner asked me how much Curtis owed me , I told him 10 s. and 6 d. for Snuff-boxes , Combs and Buttons ; and he paid me 10 s. and bid me trust him no more . I said I would not ; and he said , he would tell the Boy 's Mother , and she should pay him again . Mr. Nicolls . Last Winter was a Twelve-month I lodged at Mr. Nutt 's , and one Night in March , as I was writing , Curtis came in , and said the Prisoner was come Home drunk , and was such a nasty Toad when he was drunk , that he would lye no more with him , and therefore desired that he might lye with me while my Bedfellow was Abroad . The Prisoner and the Boy sometimes quarrel 'd . The Prisoner would say to him , You neglect your Work , and I am forced to do it for you ; but if you do n't mind it better , I 'll tell your Master . And the Boy would answer , So you may , you 're a nasty Toad . I have seen the Prisoner in variety of Company , drunk and sober , but never in any Company suspected of such Things , nor did I ever suspect him myself ; but I know the Boy was an idle Boy . Hannah Unwin . I know nothing of it . I never saw any such Thing by him . Council . No ; he 'd hardly do such Things in your Presence : But did the Boy never complain to you ? Unwin . I have heard him say , that he would not lye with the Prisoner , because he had got a stinking Breath ; and made himself so nasty with taking Snuff . Once indeed , about 2 Years ago , the Boy told me that the Prisoner would have done it , but did not ; but I never believed the Boy , because I knew he was a liar . I 've seen the Prisoner box his Ears 2 or 3 times , for neglecting his Master 's Business , and have often heard him give the Boy good Advice , which the Boy did not like ; for he has said to me , that one Reason why he did not care to lye with the Prisoner , because he was always preaching Presbyterian Sermons to him . Sometimes I have gone to call the Boy up in a morning , and then I have heard the Prisoner advice him for his good . Council . Did you never see them go up Stairs together privately ? Unwin . No . Prisoner . Had you ever any Reason to think that I was guilty of such Things ? Unwin . No . Prisoner . Have you not some Reasons to believe the contrary ? Unwin . Yes . Council . Why did he did he ever Kiss you ? Unwin . I have no need to tell you that ; but I know he had a very good Character . Tho Hambleton . I have lived in Mr. Nutt 's Family . The Boy complain 'd to me about three Quarters of a Year ago , that the Prisoner was a Molly and a Sodomite , and that he had committed Sodomy with him , and been the ruin of him ; I lay on the same Floor about 2 Years ago , and never heard any such Thing ; when he told me this Story , I did not advise him to do anything , because , I did not believe him , and I did not believe him , because , I knew him to be a great Liar ; and besides , he was a very idle Boy , and used to hide himself in Holes about the House , to keep out of the way of his Work . Mr. Heath . The Prisoner is a Relation of mine , he had a good Education , and as virtuous a Character as any Man I know , and I can not believe he would be guilty of such Things ; he served his time with Mr. Standfast , a Bookseller , in Westminster-Hall . Mr. Stag . He served his Time with Mr. Standfast , next Shop to mine , and always had the Character of a sober young Man , I recommended him to Mr. Nutt . Mr. Corbett . I have known him 11 Years , both when he was an Apprentice and a Master ; he lodg 'd and boarded 2 Years in my House , and when my Wife lay-in he lay with me , and I never found any thing in his Behaviour , but what was Sober and Modest . The Jury acquitted him , and the Court granted him a Copy of his Indictment . 86,87,88 , Edward Dalton , Rich . Griffith , alias Sergeant , and William Belt , alias Worrel , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , were indicted for the Murder of John Waller . Dalton by assaulting , striking and kicking the said Waller on the Head , Breast , Belly , and other Parts ; and thereby giving him several mortal Bruises , on the 13th of June last , about 11 in the Morning , of which he languished till 3 in the Afternoon of the same Day , and then died ; and Belt and Griffith for being present , abetting , assisting , comforting and maintaining the said Dalton in the said Murder . Cartwright Richardson . I went to see John Waller in the Pillory . The Prisoner Will Belt brought him out from Redgate 's House and put him into the Pillory , where when he had stood about two or three Minutes , Dalton and Griffith got upon the Pillory Board , Griffith took hold of Waller 's Coat , and Dalton of the Waisthand of his Breeches , and so they pulled his Head out of the Pillory , and he hung a little while by one Hand , but pulling that Hand out they threw him on the Pillory-board . Belt took him up and endeavoured to put him in again , but the hung-an-Arse , upon which Belt gave him a Knock or two over the Back , with his Hand , ( for I ca n't say that he had any Weapon ) and I believe to get him into the Pillory , but the other two Prisoners and a Chimney Sweeper laid hold of Waller , and stripped him as naked as he was born , except his Feet , for they pulled his Stockings over his Shoes and so left them ; then they beat him with Collyflower-stalks , and threw him down upon the Pillory-board . The Chimney-Sweeper put something into his Mouth , and Griffith ramm 'd it down his Throat with a Collyflower-stalk . Dalton and Griffith jumpt and stampt upon his naked Body and Head , and kick 'd him and beat him with Artichoke and Collyflower-Stalks , as he lay on the Pillory-Board . They continued beating , kicking , and stamping upon him in this manner , for above 1/4 of an Hour , and then the Mob threw down the Pillory , and all that were upon it . Waller then lay naked on the Ground . Dalton got upon him , and stamping on his Privy Parts , he gave a dismal Groan , and I believe it was his last ; for after that I never heard him groan nor speak , nor saw him stir . Council . Did you see any body else stamp upon the deceased ? Richardson . After he gave that dismal Groan the mob said he was dead , and they push one another over him ; but I did not see any Body stamp upon him besides Dalton and Griffith . Council . And do n't you think they might have avoided it if they would ? Richardson . Yes , they might ; but they did it designedly , for while they were stamping upon him , Griffith said to Dalton , Well played Partner , Dalton . And Dalton said , Aye , Damn him , I 'll never leave him while he has a bit of Life in him , for hanging my Brother . After the Deceased had been used thus near an Hour , and every Body thought he was dead ; he was taken up , and the Prisoner Belt assisted to carry him to St. Giles 's Round-house , and then a Coach was brought and he put in , and carried back to Newgate , where his Mother waited to see him . Dalton and Griffith followed the Coach . As Waller was dead , those who belonged to Newgate refused for some time to take him in again , upon which his Mother went into the Coach to him . As soon as Dalton , and Griffith saw her go in , they cryed out here 's the old Bitch his Mother , Damn her , let 's kill her too . So they went to the Coach-door , huzzaing and swearing that they had stood true to the Stuff . Damn him , says Dalton , we have sent his Soul half way to Hell , and now we 'll have his Body to sell to the Surgeons for Money to pay the Devil for his thorow Passage . Then they try 'd to pull him out of the Coach , but were prevented . Court . Did this Witness give the same Account before the Coroner ? Coroner . The Jury not being satisfy 'd as to the Identity of the Persons who committed the Fact , ( for Dalton was not present at the Examination , and there might be more then one of that Name ) and the Fact being then charged as done by Persons unknown , I was not so curious in examining the Witnesses , and therefore no Indictment could be grounded on my Inquisition ; but I believe the major Part of what this Evidence swears now was sworn by him before me . Dalton . I was not at the Place till 12 a Clock , and then the Pillory was taken down What Cloths had I ? Richardson . I did not so much mind your Cloaths , but I took particular Notice of what you said , because you spoke about your Brother . Griffith . Do you know what Cloaths I had ? Richardson . Yes , you had an old blue Coat tore down behind ; and Waller before he was stripp 'd , had a great Coat and two Waistcoats . Griffith . Was Waller alive when he was brought back to St. Andrews Holbourn ? Richardson . I ca n't say , for I thought he was dead before . Dalton . I would ask the Coroner if Waller had any Bruise upon his Privy Parts ? Mr. King , the Coroner . I viewed the deceased the next Day , and I never saw such a Spectacle . I ca n't pretend to distinguish particularly in what Part he was bruised most , for he was bruised all over : I could scarce perceive any Part of his Body free . His Head was beat quite flat , no Features could be seen in his Face , and some Body had cut him quite down the Back with a sharp Instrument . William Birch . As I came out of Mr. Britland 's , where I had been drinking , I saw Belt put Waller into the Pillory , but the Colly-flowers flew so thick about , that Belt was forced to get off soon after he had put Waller in . Then I got upon a Post before an Oyl-shop , but one getting up upon a Lamp-post just before , hindred my seeing what post farther ; and so I got down from thence , and got upon some Palisades , and then I saw Belt putting Waller into the Pillory again , and 2 Men beating Waller with Colliflower-stalks , but I do n't know who they were , nor did I hear any thing they said , for I was a pretty Way off . Soon after , the Pillory was thrown down . Rich . Fuller . I stood in a Cart , in the middle of the Street , a pretty Way off . Belt put Waller 's Head in the Pillory , but it did not say long there ; for Dalton putting his Hand in the Waisthand of Waller 's Breeches , tore them down , and pull 'd his Head out of the Pillory : for there was such a Mob that Belt could not make the Pillory fast upon his Neck . I saw Griffith and Dalton go by me a little before . Dalton had a Blue-gray Coat , and Griffith such a Waistcoat as he has now ; for I saw no Coat , as I remember . Cartwright Richardson . He had a blue Coae tore down behind . Fuller . When Waller 's Head was out , he hung by one Arm for a Minute or two , and then fell on the Pillory Board . They went to put him in again , but he was obstinate , and fell down again . Then they beat him with Artichoak Stalks all over . Court , They ! Who ? Fuller . I ca n't say that I saw the Prisoners beat him , for there was a great Mob then , and I was a pretty Way off . Richardson . I stood close to the Pillory . Fuller . On the Thursday before ( the Tuesday that ) Waller stood in the Pillory , as the Carman ( who was to carry the Pillory ) was coming by Newgate , Griffith asked him where were his Orders for carrying the Pillory ? and told him , that he had carried almost a Sack full of Artichoaks and Colliflower-stalks in readiness ; and swore that he would do Waller 's Business , and he should never live to stand at Hick 's Hall . And a Day or two before this I met Dalton in Smithfield , and he said he wou 'd be revenged on Waller , because Waller had hanged his Brother . I knew Dalton by seeing him often about Smithfield , and being always at Pillories ; but I do n't keep him Company , for I 'm very honest . And afterwards when I and Mr. Britland a Sollicitor ( who was Waller 's Uncle ) took Dalton in Smithfield , and thrust him into an Alehouse , he said , If Waller 's Mother had stood in the Pillory , he would have served her the same . Thomas James . About a Week before Waller was set in the Pillory , Griffith told me at Cow-cross , that he would do his Business . William Wills , On Whitson-Friday , I was standing in Bow-Fair by Ned Dalton , and some others , who were tossing up for Money , and a Man said , that Waller was to stand in the Pillory . By God , says Dalton , he shall never come out alive , for I 'll have his Blood . Grace Welsh . Ten Days after Waller was kill 'd as my Brother and another Man and I were drinking in Smithfield , Griffith came in , and would have sate down by the Man . Says the Man , I do n't like Rebels Company , you are one of those that killed Waller . Damn me , says Griffith , I shall come to be hang 'd about this one Time or another . I hear that there has been an Inques , but they say , there 's no body appears to prosecute . And somebody talking about Soot , says Griffith , I did not put the Soot into his Mouth , it was the Chimney-weeper ; but I ram 'd it down his Throat with a Colliflower Stalk . Martha Smith . I am Mother to the Deceased John Waller . I did not see him till he was brought home dead in a Coach to Newgate . There was a Man in the Coach , and they put me in , and I laid my Son 's Head in my Lap . Dalton stood on that side the Coach next to Newgate Lodge , and Griffith stood on the other side . Dalton call 'd out to Griffith , There 's the old Bitch his Mother , kill her , because I have kill 'd her Son . - I have stood stiff . My son had neither Eyes , nor Ears , nor Nose to be seen ; they had squeezed his Head flat . Griffith pull 'd open the Coach-door , and struck me , pull 'd my Son 's Head out of my Lap , and his Brains fell into my Hand . Soon after my Son was convicted here , Dalton said , he had spent Half a Crown for Joy the Rogue was to stand in the Pillory , because he had hang 'd his Brother , and he swore he would have his Check The Day before my Son was kill 'd , as I was going up the steps . at Newgate , Belt stood there , and said to one that stood by him . That 's Waller 's Mother . What 's that to you ? says I . What , says the Man , be that 's to stand in the Pillory ? Yes , says Belt ; but bill stand but once . He had better be hang 'd , for he shall never come back alive . Court . Did he say , he never shall , or never will ? Smith . He said , never shall . He said those Words if I never was to go into the Kingdom of Heaven . Belt . I never saw the Woman there ; but she has often thrown Colliflower stalks at me . Dalton . I have had my Witnesses here every Day this Sessions , but now they are gone . Court . Carwright Richardson ! Are you any Kin to Waller ? C. Richardson . No . I never saw him but thrice before he was kill 'd . Belt 's Defence . Robert Nash , Middlesex-Officer . Waller was under my Care ; and while I was with him at Redgat 's Alehouse in Kinestreet , Belt came to me , and I employ 'd him to P Waller in the Pillory , which he de did , and I paid him for it . I was present , and neither saw nor heard that he abused Waller . Edward Chaise , Serjeant . I was there , and neither saw nor heard of any Hurt that he did to Waller , but so far from it , that he run the Hazard of his own Life , by endeavouring to put Waller 's Head in twice . It was not in his Power to prevent the Abuses the other Prisoners committed , for he was forced to get off the Pillory to save himself . Other Officers deposed to the like Effect . Ann Harwood . I live with Mrs. Belt the Prisoner 's Mother : And one Day since Waller 's Death , Martha Smith ( Waller 's Mother ) came by my Mistress 's Door , and threw in Artichoak-stalks , and said she would have her Son 's Blood , right or wrong . The Jury acquitted Belt , and found Dalton and Griffith guilty of the Indictment . Death . 89. John Roberts of St. Sepulchres , was indicted for man slaughter of Richard Dalbey , by beating him on the Head . Face and Belly , with both his Hands , and thereby giving him several mortal Bruises , on the 12th of August , of which he languished till next Day , and then died . Acquitted . 90.

Margaret Dun and Joshua Wood , were indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , and 3 Broad-pieces , and 6 Guineas , the Goods and Money of J. Salmon , July 7 . John Salmon . About 9 at Night , the Prisoner Dun and Elizabeth Whattle pick 'd me up in Cornhill , and carried me to Mr. Friths , at the Bull-Inn , in Leadenball-Street , where the Prisoner Wood is Chamberlain , we went into a Close-room , no Body was there with me but the 2 Women and Wood . My money and Watch were in my Fob . I staid till 2 or 3 in the morning , and fell asleep , and the Woman went away ; when I wak 'd I miss 'd my money and my Watch , I call 'd the Chamberlain Wood , and told him I had been robbed , and at last he told me after some Disputes that he had got the Watch ; how came you by it ? says I . Why , says he , as the Women were going out , I saw the Chain hang out of one of their Bosoms , and so I brought her in again , and asked if you had lost any thing ? And you said , No ; but when I went again next Day , he told me , that seeing the Watch hanging loose about me , he took it away to take care of it . Wood . Was you Drunk or Sober ? Salmon . No ; I ca n't say I drunk , I was only a little merry and foolish . Wood . Was it not the publick Taphouse that you sat in ? Salmon . Yes . Wood . You said it was a Close-Room . Salmon . Close ? Why , yes , it was not in the open Yard . 1 Watchman . Two or three Nights after this , the Prisoners were brought before me and the City Marshal . Wood said , that the Prosecutor coming in suddled with 2 Women , he mistrusted they would rob him , and therefore desir 'd his Master not to let them go , without acquainting the Prosecutor with it , and Peg Dan confess 'd that Bess Whattle had pick 'd the Gentleman 's Pocket , and had given her a Guinea of the Money . 2 Watchman . I heard Peg say , that she had a Guinea and a Half of the Gentleman 's Money from Bess . That same Bull-Inn is a House of ill Repute , several such People have been taken out of it . Court . Such Houses ought to be suppress 'd , they ought to be prosecuted as common Baudy Houses . Prisoner Wood . My Mistress shew 'd the Prosecutor and the 2 Women into the Taphouse ; one of the Women said she knew him . I desir 'd my Master , to watch the Women ; they had 4 Pints of Wine , the Prosecutor gave me half a Guinea to change , and fell a-sleep . One of the Women was making her escape , I brought her back and waked him , and said , Are you sensible ? and he answer 'd , Yes . Then see if you have lost nothing , says I , 3 or 4 times over ; he fell in a Passion , Damn you , says he , what 's that to you , they have got nothing but what I gave them freely ; so the Women went away , and I perceiving he held his Watch dangling upon his Finger , I was afraid he would-spoil it , and desir 'd him to let me take care of it for him , and so he gave it me ; I desir 'd him to go to Bed , but he said , he would sleep there , and so he did , he lay and slept , and piss 'd about the Floor with his Cloaths all unbutton 'd ; I sat up for him , and he call 'd me about 2 , and I gave him the Watch without any Words . Prisoner Dun . Bess Whattle gave me a Guinea and a Half , which was part of what the Gentleman gave her . Frith . My Wife shew 'd them into the Taphouse , and then went to Bed ; about a 11 I lighted a Man out of the Gate , and 1 of the Women follow 'd , and was going to get out too ; but the Chamberlain ( Wood ) call 'd to me to stop her , and so I brought her back , and both the Women went away soon after . The Chamberlain and I going into the Taphouse , found the Prosecutor with his Breeches down , his Shirt hanging out , and all bepiss 'd under him , he was fast a-sleep , and we could not wake him , to get him to Bed . The Chamberlain gave me a Watch to take care of , and so I went to Bed , and bid him sit up , and next Morning I gave him the Watch again , and he gave it to the Prosecutor . Wood is a very honest man , I have trusted him with hundreds of Pounds . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners .
