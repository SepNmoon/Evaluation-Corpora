The Defendants being thus arraigned , the Court thought the Day too far spent to proceed to a Trial of so much Expectation , and therefore ordered it to come on the next Morning ; but the Counsel for the Prosecutor alledging they could not attend the next Day , and desiring to put off the Trial to this present Sessions , the Court were pleased to indulge them , upon their consenting that the Defendants should be admitted to Bail . Whereupon Mr Annesley was ordered to give four Sureties in 250 l. each , and Joseph Redding four in 50 l. each ; and this being done in Court they were both immediately set at Liberty . On Wednesday the fourteenth Day of July 1742 , the Prosecutor 's Council mov 'd that the Trial might come on the next Day , which by Consent of the Defendants Solicitor was ordered accordingly ; notwithstanding which , the next Day when the two Defendants had surrendered themselves , and were ready with their Witnesses , the Prosecutor moved to put the Trial off for another Day ; but not alledging any sufficient Reason for the Delay , the Court were pleased to direct the Trial to go on . Accordingly the Defendants were again arraigned and pleaded as at the last Sessions , and there being no Challenges to the Jury , The following Gentlemen were impannelled and sworn . The Names of the Jury . Walter Lee , John Deschamps , John Reynolds , William Lewis , Francis Rawlins , John Sandwich , Robert Harrop , William Duck , William Boucher , Edmund Stowell , Thomas Whitehead , Francis Tredgold . Cryer . If any one can inform my Lords the King 's Justices , & c. Clerk of the Arraigns . James Annesley , hold up your Hand . Joseph Redding , hold up your Hand . You of the Jury look upon the Prisoners and hearken to their Charge . They stand indicted by the Names of James Annesley , late of Staines in the County of Middlesex , Labourer , and Joseph Redding of the same , Labourer ; for that they , & c. ( as in the Indictments , ) and upon these Indictments they have been arraigned , and thereunto pleaded not guilty , and for their Trial have put themselves upon their Country , which Country you are , your Charge is to enquire , & c. Mr Brown . My Lord , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , this is an Indictment for Murder . The Indictment sets forth that James Annesley and Joseph Redding , did make an Assault with a Gun , on the Body of one Thomas Egglestone ; and that the Prisoner Annesley did discharge the said Gun against the left Side of the said Thomas Egglestone , and did make a Wound on the left Side of the Belly of the said Thomas Egglestone , of which he instantly died ; and that the said Joseph Redding was aiding and assisting the said James Annesley , to murder the said Thomas Egglestone . Gentlemen , if we prove our Charge I hope you will find the Prisoners guilty . Mr Serjeant Gapper . Gentlemen , the Prisoners stand indicted for the Murder of Thomas Egglestone ; James Annesley was the Person who killed the said Thomas Egglestone , and Joseph Redding he was aiding , abetting , and assisting in the Murder , and so they are both guilty of Felony and Murder . And , Gentlemen , there is an Act of Parliament , made in the Ninth Year of his late Majesty King George I , that if any Person does wilfully shoot at another , 't is Felony without Benefit of Clergy . Gentlemen , the Case is thus . On Saturday the First of May , Thomas Egglestone , the deceased , and his Son , were going to fish , at a Place called the Moor , near Slaines ; they had a Casting-Net , and there was a String which belongs to the Net , and this String was about the deceased 's right Arm : They were fishing in a Meadow belonging to one Sylvester ; and as they were fishing towards the North of the Enclosure , the Deceased seeing the Prisoners , stopped , and went back again , and as they were going back again , instantly came up the Prisoner , Joseph Redding , and seized the Deceased by the Shoulder , and demanded the Net , but the Deceased cast the Net into the River , which was on his Right-Hand ; then came up the other Prisoner , Annesley , with a Gun in his Hand , and swore at the Deceased , and said , Damn you surrender , or you are a dead Man ; he pointed the Gun immediately towards his Side before a Word of Reply , and shot him , the Force of the Powder drove the Shot and some of the deceased 's Coat into his Body ; he clapped his Hand to his Side , and said , You Rogue , what have you done ? dropped down and died immediately ; then John Egglestone , the Son , took a Knife out of his Pocket to cut the String of the Net ; upon which , the Prisoner Annesley turned the butt End of the Gun , and said to him , You Rogue , I will knock your Head off ; to avoid which , young Egglestone jump 'd into the Water , Breast high , and cut the String of the Net , and dragged it to the other Side of the Water , and cried out his Father was murdered . There were three Persons , Fisher , Bettesworth , and Bowles , who could see what was done ; they were on the other Side of the River , about an Hundred and Sixty Yards from the Place where the Accident happened ; they heard a Gun fired , and the young Man cry out that his Father was kill 'd ; and when they came to the River Side , he had just dragg 'd the Net out of the River ; upon this they crossed over , and found the Man dead , or so bad that he could not live , and thereupon directed the Son to go and fetch Mr Cole , a Surgeon at Slaines ; he went accordingly to Mr Cole , and desired him to come along with him , for his Father was shot , and he believed he was dead . Why , says Mr Cole , if he is dead , it does not signify my coming , I can do him no good ; so then the young Man went to Mr Russel , a Constable at Slaines : But I should tell you , Gentlemen , that as soon as the Prisoners saw these three Persons , Fisher , Bettesworth , and Bowles , coming towards the River , they ran away . Afterwards Russel , the Constable , and some other Persons coming up , they thought proper to pursue the Murderers : Accordingly they went to a Farm-House where Annesley and Redding used sometimes to lodge , and there they found Annesley , and apprehended him , and sent him to the Round-House at Slaines ; Redding could never be found , but he has surrendered himself since , in order to take his Trial . The Prisoner Annesley was carried before a Justice of the Peace , I think Sir Thomas Reynall , he was carried to Hounslow , and from thence to Laleham , what that Examination was , I can not tell . They made Application to this young Man to be favourable , and not to carry on the Prosecution ; says he , Gentlemen , I will not sell my Father 's Blood . This , Gentlemen , is the Nature of the Case , and if we prove our Charge , that they have been guilty of Murder , Gentlemen , you will find them guilty . [ John Egglestone sworn . ] Mr Serj . Gapper . Give an Account of what you know of this Matter , and speak the Truth . John Egglestone . A n't please you , my Lord , on Saturday the first of May , - Serj . Gapper . Speak slow and deliberately , that the Court and the Jury may hear you . John Egglestone . A n't please you , my Lord , on Saturday , the first of May last , I and my Father were going up Staines River , to catch a Dish of Fish in Staines Moor , in the Parish of Staines , with a Casting-Net ; we fish 'd all the Wa y up till we came to this Ground . Mr Serj . Gapper . In whose Possession was the Ground ? John Egglestone . It was Mr Samuel Sylvester 's Meadow ; we were turning back again , a n't please you my Lord , in order to go home ; my Father he carried the Net upon his Arm , and the String was fastened to his Arm . Mr Serj . Gapper . Well , as you were coming back from fishing , what happened then ? John Egglestone . By that Time we had got half Way in the Meadow , we saw Joseph Redding and Mr Annesley running , and Joseph Redding out run Mr Annesley , and came up to my Father first . Mr Serj . Gapper . When they came up what was the first thing they did ? John Egglestone . Redding took my Father by the Collar , and demanded the Net , and he refused to deliver the Net . Court . Did you see him take him by the Collar ? John Egglestone . Yes my Lord . Serj . Gapper . What became of the Net afterwards . John Egglestone . My Father threw it into the River . Mr Serj . Gapper . How far were you from the River then ? John Egglestone . I was about two Yards from the River . After the Net was thrown into the River , Annesley came up with his Gun , and swore God damn your Blood deliver your Net , or you are a dead Man ; and he fir 'd off before he received any Answer from my Father . Mr Serj . Gapper . In what Manner did Annesley hold his Gun ? John Egglestone . In this Manner . ( Pointing the Gun strait forward , holding it about Breast high , stooping a little . ) Mr Serj . Gapper . How near was the Gun to your Father when he fir 'd it ? John Egglestone . It was close to my Father 's Side , he put the Gun between Redding and my Father , and shot directly into his left Side , here , ( holding his Hand to his Hip ) he had a Plate Button there , which was bruised to pieces ; then my Father said , You Rogue , what have you done , I am a dead Man , and dropp 'd immediately . Mr Serj . Gapper . What did Annesley say before he fir 'd ? John Egglestone . He swore if he did not deliver the Net he was a dead Man , and then fir 'd immediately . Mr Serj . Gapper . What did you do after you heard your Father say he was a dead Man ? John Egglestone . I took a Knife out of my Pocket to cut the String of the Net ; and Annesley said , You Rogue , I will knock out your Brains too , and held up the butt End of his Gun ; upon that I jump 'd into the Stream , and cut the String , and drew the Net over to the other Side of the River : then says Annesley , the Rogue has got the Net , let us go on the other Side after him . Mr Serj . Gapper . Who did you see when you came on the other Side of the River ? John Egglestone . I saw John Bettesworth , John Fisher , and John Bowles , and when Annesley and Redding saw these three Men they ran away directly . Mr Serj . Gapper . How near were Bettesworth , Fisher , and Bowles to you before Annesley and Redding ran away ? John Egglestone . As soon as I got on the other Side of the River they saw these three Men coming , and then they ran away , and Bettesworth , Fisher , and Bowles came through the River to the Side where my Father lay dead ; they came from one Side to the other . Mr Serj . Gapper . What did you do then ? John Egglestone . They bid me get a Surgeon ; so I went to one Charles Cole , a Surgeon at Staines . Mr Serj . Gapper . When you came to Staines did you meet with Cole . John Egglestone . Yes : And I told him my Father was shot , and I believed he was dead or dying , but he never came near my Father ; then I went to Russel the Constable , and he took some Townsmen with him , and went to old Mr Redding 's House at Yeovely Farm , to search for the Man that kill 'd my Father ; we beset the House all round , and found James Annesley hid up in a Corner . Mr Serj . Gapper . How long were you there before he was found ? John Egglestone . I was there about a Quarter of an Hour , or a little more . Mr Serj . Gapper . Was you present then ? John Egglestone . Yes : I was there all the Time ; then , a n't please you my Lord , they pull 'd him down . Mr Serj . Gapper . Where was he hid ? John Egglestone .

Court . Was there a Chimney in it ? John Egglestone . I do not know . Mr Serj . Gapper . Was he standing up or lying down , or how was he when he was found ? John Egglestone . I do not know , for I did not see him till he was pull 'd down ; he was carried in a Chair into the Yard , and sat there about a Quarter of an Hour , and then was put into the Cart that brought up my Father , and was carried to the Round-House at Staines . Mr Serj . Gapper . This is all you know , is it not ? John Egglestone . A n't please you , my Lord , I can tell you a great deal more . Mr Serj . Gapper . Who pull 'd him down ? John Egglestone . I do not know . Mr Serj . Gapper . Was this Wound the Occasion of your Father 's Death ? John Egglestone . Yes , it was . Mr Serj . Gapper . Go on ; you say you have other Things to say . John Egglestone . He lay in the Round-House all Night , the next Day Annesley the Prisoner and I went in a Cart to a Justice at Hounslow , and there was one Mc . Kercher there , who said to me Court . What Mc . Kercher said is no Evidence against the Prisoners . Mr Serj . Gapper . We will let this alone a little . Court . Can you prove he was any ways employ 'd as an Agent by the Prisoner . Mr Serj . Gapper . I believe we can . Foreman of the Jury . My Lord , please to ask him whether there was no Quarrel , Bustle , or Struggling , between Annesley , Redding , and Egglestone , before the Gun went off . John Egglestone . There was no Quarrel or Jostling , my Father never gave him an ill Word . Court . Did your Father make no Resistance ? John Egglestone . No , no Resistance at all . Q . Was there no Jostling , nor any thing else pass 'd ? John Egglestone . Yes : Redding took my Father by the Collar , and Annesley came up in the mean Time . Court .

They were in the Ground called Mr Sylvester 's Rents . Mr Serj . Gapper . Are there many Hedges on the Side of the River where the Deceased was ? Bettesworth .

Gapper . What Hedge ? Bettesworth . The Hedge that parted Mr Sylvester 's Ground from Mr Redding 's Ground , I do not know whether one of them did not come over the Stile , then they both run after Egglestone and his Son ; young Redding came up first .

John Bowles , and John Fisher , we came to the River just against the Place where Mr Egglestone lay , and we could not get over there without being up thus high ; ( putting his Hand to his Middle ) but we went over in a shallower Place a little farther . Mr Serj . Gapper . Were Annesley and Redding there when you came over ? Bettesworth . No , they run away before that . Mr Serj . Gapper . Was Egglestone dead or alive when you came up ? Bettesworth .

Gapper . Did you all three come away together ? Bettesworth . Yes , I was coming rather before the Boy cried out , for I saw the Man drop , I could not see the Boy for a good while , for he was in the River , and he cut the Net from his Father 's Arm , as he says , I did not see that ; but I saw the Boy come cross the River , and when I came up I saw that the Net was brought cross the River . Mr Serj . Grapper . How did Egglestone lie ? Bettesworth . He lay upon his Face ; I lifted up his Head , he groan 'd pretty much , but he could not speak : I sent the Boy for a Surgeon , but no Surgeon came . Mr Serj . Gapper . Was you at the apprehending of the Prisoner ? Bettesworth . Yes , I was . Mr Serj . Gapper . What Place was it that the Prisoner was in when he was taken ? Bettesworth . It was a Sort of a Wash-house , a Back-house : He was in a Place where they throw up Hoops and Iron , and any Sort of old Lumber ; I saw him lie upon his Face . Mr Serj . Gapper . Who took him down ? Bettesworth . I do not know . Mr Serj . Gapper . What did they do with him then ? Bettesworth . They carried him to the Round House at Staines . Court . When you came to the place where you say he had hid himself , did he come down of his own accord ? Bettesworth . Yes , my Lord . Mr Brown . When you heard the Gun go off whose Hand was it in ? Bettesworth . Mr Annesley 's . Mr Brown . Do you know the Position of the Gun when it went off ? Bettesworth . No , I do not . Mr Brown . Did you observe any Struggle between Annesley , Redding , and the Deceased ? Bettesworth . No other than their striving to take the Net away . Q . Do you remember any Thing that passed in the Round-House ? - Did the Prisoner say any thing there ? Bettesworth . Yes , the Prisoner said he desired to be kill 'd out of the Way , for being accessary to such an innocent Man 's Death . Brown . What did he tell you besides ? Bettesworth . He said he would have gone home for more Men , but Joseph Redding would not let him . Mr Brown . What did he want more Men for ? Bettesworth . To take away the Net . Q . What Answer did he say Redding made him to that ? Bettesworth . I believe it was , that he said we can do it well enough . [ The Prosecutor 's Council having done with this Witness , he was cross examin 'd as follows . ] Q . Did you see Mr Annesley and Redding before they came up to the Deceased ? Bettesworth . Yes , I did . Q . Did you observe Mr Annesley making any Use of his Gun before he came up ? Bettesworth . I saw him offer to shoot at a Crow . Court . How long was that before this Accident happen 'd ? Bettesworth . I believe about half an Hour . Q . Was the Crow flying or sitting ? Bettesworth . Flying . Q . Did you observe whether he did shoot at the Crow ? Bettesworth . Not then , he did not . Q . How far were you off then ? Bettesworth . About as far , I think , as when I saw the Man kill 'd . Q . What was the Position of the Gun when you saw him come up running . Bettesworth . It was on this Manner , [ holds it as if the Gun was with the Muzzle hanging a little Slanting towards the Ground . ] Mr Brown . You say you saw Annesley and Redding in the other Ground , before they came into that Ground which belongs to Sylvester - what were they doing there , were they standing , sitting , or what ? Bettesworth . They were sitting or lying under the Hedge , I can not tell which . Q . For what Purpose do you imagine they were sitting or lying there ? Bettesworth . I can not say that , I may imagine they came to take the Net away , I can not imagine any thing else . Q . Did you see the Boy go into the River ? Bettesworth . Yes , and it was just after his Father was shot . [ John Fisher sworn . ] Mr Brown . Do you know the Prisoners at the Bar ? Fisher . I know Mr Redding . Q . Do you believe this to be the Person who was along with Mr Redding at the Time that Mr Egglestone was kill 'd ? - Look at Mr Annesley 's Face , and see whether that is the Man . Fisher . I see Mr Annesley , but I can not say that he is the Man ; I saw two Men lie under the Hedge a considerable Time , and saw a Piece in one of their Hands . Brown . In which Ground were they ? Fisher . I believe in Mr Redding 's Ground . Brown . In what Ground was Egglestone ? Fisher . He was in Sylvester 's Ground . Bettesworth called to me , and said there is Redding running after Egglestone , and Redding laid hold of Egglestone , the Deceased , and then came up the other with a Piece : I can not say whether he touched him or no . Court . In what Manner did Redding lay hold of him ? Fisher . I can not say , I was at such a Distance ; but I thought he laid hold of his Shoulder . Brown . Did Egglestone make away from him ? Fisher . Yes ; for he knew he was out of the Bounds that he ought to have been fishing in ; and there was a Sort of a Struggle to take away the Net ; and I thought that Redding and the other Person did both , snatch at the Net , and then the Gun went off . Brown . In whose Hand was the Gun ? Fisher . Not in Redding 's Hand , but in the Hand of the other Person . Brown . Was not you attentive at that Time , to see in what Manner he carried the Gun ? Fisher . It may be this way , or this way , I can not say whether he had the Gun against his Shoulder or no . Brown . How near was he to the Deceas 'd ? Fisher . Very nigh , I believe not above the Length of a Gun . Serj . Gapper . Did you see John Egglestone by , when you first came up ? Fisher . He was near the River . Brown . Did you hear the Boy cry out ? Fisher . Yes , he said his Father was killed ; - he saw me , and called me by my Name , and said my Father is killed , and I came directly cross the River . Brown . What then became of Annesley and the other ? Fisher . They run away ; we hallooed after them , but I did not think the Man was shot , though I saw the Smoak and Fire of the Gun . Q . Who went over the River first ? Fisher . We were all three together almost . I can not tell who was over first , but I believe I was . Q . What was said to the Boy then ? Fisher . Nothing ; only to go and get a Surgeon . Q . Who bid him go ? Fisher . Some Body did , I did not . I believe it was Bettesworth , and the Boy run away directly . Q . Was there any Surgeon brought there ? Fisher . No . Q . Who came there afterwards ? Fisher . Mr Sylvester , he saw the Deceased lying upon the Ground , but he was not there when the Murder was committed ? Q . Was you in the House when he was taken ? Fisher . No . Q . Was you with him before the Justice of Peace ? Fisher . I was examined , but I was not present when the other Witnesses were examined . Mr Brown . What Distance was there between you and the Deceased , when the Gun went off ? Fisher . One Hundred and Sixty-nine Yards . Q . Do you include the Breadth of the River ? Fisher . Yes I do . [ Cross examined . ] Q . You say you think that both Redding and Annesley snatch 'd at the Net ? Fisher . I think they did . Q . Do you think it was possible for you to hear what passed between them ? Fisher . I could not hear one Word . Q. I would ask you , whether young Egglestone , before he was examined by Sir Thomas Reynell , did not say to you he believed the Gun did go off by Accident ? Fisher . He said he believed it was not done wilfully . I was called into a Room with Chester and Lane : He had Money offered him , in my hearing , by John Lane ; he offered him 100 l. a Year . Mr Annesley said he could not give him 100 l. - but he would give him 50 l. for he had others to do for ; then , said the Boy , I do not care to sell my Father 's Blood ; but I will do as my Friends direct me ; I believe he was in Liquor . Q . What did you say to him . Fisher . I said your Father is dead ; the Money will do you good ; do not swear any thing against him , if you think it was done accidentally ; he said the Money will do me good if I had it ; and then said , I believe the Gentleman did not do it wilfully . Q . Had you not some Conversation together , after his Examination before the Justice ? Fisher . I asked him , after he was examined , what he had done ; and how he could swear against him , when he had said so and so to me ; said he , I did not know what I said . Q That he did not know what he said , to who ? Fisher . I asked him how he could swear against him when he knew what he said to me , said he , I do not know any Thing of the Matter ; he did not remember what he had said to me . Q . Do you know Mr Williams the Clergyman ? Fisher . Yes . Q . Did not you make a Declaration of this to him ? Fisher . Yes ; and I told him what I now say , I mean what passed between us at the Time he went before the Justice : I said to Mr Williams , that Egglestone told me he really believed that the Gentleman did not do it wilfully . Q. Repeat all that you said to Mr Williams . Fisher . That the Boy said to me , Mr Annesley had offered him 50 l. a Year , that the Money would do him good if he had it , and that he believ 'd the Gentleman did not do it wilfully . Mr Brown . Did not he say it was wilfully done as you were going along to the Justice 's ? Fisher . All the Way he went , he said he believ 'd he did it wilfully , but after the Prisoner had been talking with him , he said he believed it was not done wilfully . [ Samuel Sylvester sworn . ] Mr Serj . Gapper . Did you see the Deceas 'd after he was dead ? Sylvester . He lay dead on the Ground that I rent , near the River Side , I think about the Middle of the Ground . Mr Serj . Gapper . Do you know how he came by his Death ? Sylvester . I was going up to look after my Ground , to see if there was any Cattle in it , or any thing amiss . - I call 'd at the Cock , and drank two Pints of Beer , and when I came within two Hundred Yards or thereabouts , of my Ground , I met three Men , who told me old Egglestone was killed ; I did not believe it , they then pointed to my Ground , and said , there he lies ; I saw several People there , upon which I thought there was something more than common , and so I went up and saw Tom . Egglestone lie dead in my Ground . Mr Serj . Gapper . Do you know where the Prisoner Annesley was taken ? Sylvester . He was taken in a back Building belonging to Mr Redding 's House ; I was searching the Rooms myself , and heard the People say , here he is , and I saw Mr Annesley , who is the Gentleman there , come down out of the Place . Mr Brown . What sort of a Place was it he was found in ? Sylvester . It was a Place to put odd things in : It was not boarded up to the Top . Q Did he come down voluntarily , or was he pulled down ? Sylvester . I do n't know whether they pulled him down or helped him down . Mr Brown . Did you hear him say any thing at that Time . Sylvester . I did not hear him say any Thing , I believe he was in a Fit , for he trembled and fell down behind the Door . Mr Brown . Did you see him at the Round-House ? Sylvester . No , I did not , for I was gone to search after the other Prisoner Redding . Mr Serj . Gapper . Was you at Laleham before the Justice ? Sylvester . Yes , I was . Mr Serj . Gapper . Had not the Boy been drinking , and did he not sleep before he went in to the Justice . Sylvester . I believe he did , for about three Quarters of an Hour , I do believe he had been in Liquor , but he was refreshed afterwards . [ Upon the cross Examination . ] Q . Have you not received Money to pay the Witnesses for attending here on this Cause the last Sessions , and from whom ? Sylvester . Yes , I paid some of them , I think it was by Mr Giffard 's direction who subpoena 'd me up ; I asked him who was to pay me , he said I should be paid Half a Crown a Day for my Time , which was as much as he thought I could earn at my Business . Q . What Business is this Giffard of ? Sylvester . He is a Stranger to me . Q Do you know who he said he was employed by ? Sylvester . He said he was concerned for the King . Q Did you send Notice of this Accident to any Body as soon as the Man was killed ? Sylvester . No . Q Do you know Mr Williams ? Sylvester . Yes , I know him , but I never was in his Company upon this Occasion . Q What Business does young Egglestone follow ? Sylvester . I can not say what Business he follows , I believe he draws Beer now . Q How long have you known him ? Sylvester . I have known him five or six Years . Q . What Business was he bred to ? Sylvester . Sometimes he would be out at Service , and sometimes he would be with his Father in the Business of a Carpenter . Q . Where does he draw Beer now ? Sylvester . I think it is at Mr Williams 's , at the White-Horse in Pickadilly . But this is not the Williams I was speaking of before . Q . Have you never been in Company with this Gentleman , and had some Conversation with him about this Affair ? Sylvester . I have been at the Gentleman 's House in Pickadilly since this Business has been in Hand , but never before ; and I have been in Company with the Gentleman there , but never had any talk with him about this Trial . Q . Was not this Williams down before the Justice ? Sylvester . I do not know . Q . Did you ever see him at Staines ? Sylvester . I saw him in the Town of Staines , I believe about a Week after the Accident happened . Q . Have you seen the Boy , Egglestone , there since ? Sylvester . I never saw him at Staines afterwards . Q . What he has lived with Williams ever since ? Sylvester . I ca n't tell . Q. I ask you whether you have not seen him at Williams 's House every Time you have been there ? Sylvester . Yes , I believe I did . Mr Serj . Gapper then said , they would rest it here ; And having observed upon the Evidence , concluded with saying , he hoped it had fully made out the Charge against the Prisoners ; that the Ground where the Man was killed being the Property of Sylvester , the Prisoners were Trespassers by coming into it , and therefore answerable for the Consequences . That as to Mr Annesley , there was not only implied , but express Malice proved upon him , for that after he had killed the Father , he was for beating out the Son 's Brains , only because they would not let him and the other Prisoner run away with their Net . Court . Mr Annesley , you are indicted in a very unhappy Case , what have you to say for yourself ? Mr Annesley . My Lord , I am very unable to make a proper Defence , having by the Cruelty of those , whose Duty it was to protect me , been deprived of the Advantages of an Education I was entituled to by my Birth . All I know of the melancholy Accident in Question is , that on the unfortunate Day mention 'd in the Indictment , I went out with my Gun , in company with my innocent Fellow-Prisoner , to shoot Sparrows , as I usually did . As we were going along , Mr Redding , who is Game-Keeper to the Lord of the Manour , saw some People a poaching within the Royalty , upon which he proposed to go and seize their Nets , I followed him , the Deceas 'd threw the Net into the River , and the Boy jump 'd in to pull it across , to prevent which , I stoop 'd to lay hold of one of the Ropes that trailed upon the Ground , and at the same Instant , the fatal Instrument I had in my other Hand , hanging by my Side , went off without my Knowledge , and to my great Grief as well as Surprize . My Behaviour , immediately after the Accident , was , I hope , inconsistent with a Temper that could murder a Man I had never seen before , without one Word of Provocation . Whatever may be the Determination of your Lordship and the Jury , great as the Misfortunes of my Life have been , I shall always consider this unfortunate Accident as the greatest of them all . Court . Mr Redding , what have you to say for yourself ? Joseph Redding . My Lord , I am Game-Keeper to Sir John Dolben , Lord of the Manour of Yeoveney . On the first of May last , in the Afternoon , Mr Annesly and I went out a walking ; we saw a Crow , and Mr Annesley made an Offer to shoot at her , but I called to him not to fire , for that she was too far off : Soon after I saw Egglestone and his Son a fishing with a Casting-Net , upon which I said to Mr Annesley , I would go and endeavour to take their Net away , as it was my Duty to do ; according I went up to the Deceas 'd and demanded the Net , which he refused to deliver to me , and threw it into the River , one End of the String being about his Arm , I then laid hold of the String , and pulled , whilst the Boy endeavoured to draw it cross the River , and presently I heard the Gun go off ( my Back being towards Mr Annesley ) and saw the Man fall down . - I said to Mr Annesley , I hoped he had not shot the Man , he said no , but turning up the Flap of his Coat , we saw he was shot ; upon which Mr Annesley cried out , What shall I do ! and expressed so much Concern , that I am sure it was quite an accidental Thing . Mr Hume Campbell , of Council for the Prisoners , said , that although he knew by the Course of the Court at the Old-Bailey , he was not at Liberty to observe upon the Prosecutor 's Evidence , yet he apprehended , that for the Ease of the Court , he might just open the Nature of the Defence , without making any Observations upon it . That the Defence which the Prisoners insisted upon was , that the Gun went off meerly by Accident ; that Redding was Game-Keeper to Sir John Dolben , Lord of the Manour of Yeovency , and had a proper and legal Deputation for seizing of Nets and other Engines , for destroying of Game . That the Deceas 'd and his Son were poaching with a Casting-Net within the Manour ; that Mr Annesley went in Aid of the Game-Keeper ; and therefore the Prisoners being about a lawful Act , were not so much as Trespassers , and the Death that was the accidental Consequence of that Act , would , in Point of Law , make Mr Annesley guilty only of Chance Medley . [ Mr Thomas Staples sworn . ] Q . Do you know the Manour of Yeoveney ? Mr Staples . Yes : I am Deputy to my Father , who is Steward to Sir John Dolben , as Lord of the Manour , under the Dean and Chapter of Westminster . Mr Serj . Gapper . How do you know this to be a Manour ? Mr Staples . I have the Grant of the Manour , from the Dean and Chapter in my Pocket . Mr Serj . Gapper . Are there any Copy-Holders ? Mr Staples . Yes , I have admitted some Copy-Holders ; I know it to be a Manour , because I have held one Court there for my Father , and have seen him hold several . Mr Serj . Gapper . Is there any Mansion-House belonging to this Manour ? Mr Staples . There is a Mansion-House belonging to it , which I think is the House that Mr Redding lives in . Mr Serj . Gapper . What Court was it you held there ? Mr Staples . A Court-Baron . [ Mr Thomas Burlingson sworn . ] Q. Mr Burlingson , look upon this Deputation . Are you a subscribing Witness to it , if you are , did you see this executed , and by whom . Mr Burlingson . Yes , Sir , that is my Name , I saw Sir John Dolben execute it , this is his Hand and Seal . Court . Was it executed at the Time it bears Date . Mr Burlingson . Yes , I believe on the very Day . [ Mr James Edmonds sworn . ] Q. Mr Edmonds , look upon that Endorsement , do you know whose Hand that is ? Mr Edmonds . My Lord , I went to the Clerk of the Peace for the County of Middlesex , and heard him acknowledge this to be his Hand , and that it was entred according to the Act of Parliament . Mr Serj . Gapper . Did you see any Entry of it ? Mr Edmonds . He said it was entred , and acknowledged this to be his Hand , and told me that was sufficient . Q . My Lord , we pray the Deputation may be read , we will send for the Clerk of the Peace to bring the Book itself , where it is entred . The Clerk reads . Sign 'd J. Dolben , dated the 2d of July , 1741 . KNOW all Men by these Presents , that I Sir John Dolben , of Shindon in the County of Northampton , Baronet , and Doctor of Divinity , Lord of the Manour of Yeoveney , in the Parish of Staines , in the County of Middlesex , By Virtue of the several Acts of Parliament lately made , for the Preservation of the Game , have made , nominated , authorized , constituted , and appointed , and by these Presents do make , nominate , authorize , constitute , and appoint , Joseph Redding the Younger , of Yeoveney aforesaid , in the said Parish of Staines and County of Middlesex , Husbandman , to be my Game-Keeper of and within my Manour of Yeoveney aforesaid , of all and all Manner of Game , of what Kind or Nature soever , which now is , or hereafter shall be , upon or within the Bounds , Limits , or Precincts of the same , with full Power and Authority , according to the Directions of the Statute in that Case made and provided , to kill any Hares , Patridges , Pheasants , Fish , or other Game whatsoever , upon or within my said Manour , and the Bounds , Limits , and Precincts of the same : And also to take and seize all such Guns , Grey-Hounds , Setting-Dogs , and other Dogs , Hare-Pipes , Snares , Low-Bells , Ferress , Tramels , Hays , Tunnels , or other Nets or Engines , for the taking , killing , or destroying of Hares , Patridges , Pheasants , Fish , or other Game , within my said Manour , and the Precincts thereof , that shall be kept or used by any Person or Persons , not legally qualified to do the same : And further to act and do all and every Thing and Things which belongs to the Office of a Game-Keeper , pursuant to the Directions of the said Act of Parliament . And lastly , I do direct that the Name of the said Joseph Redding he entred as such Game-Keeper of my said Manour , with the Clerk of the Peace for the said County of Middlesex , pursuant or according to the Act or Acts of Parliament in that Case made and provided . In Witness whereof , I have hereunto set my Hand and Seal , the second Day of July , in the Year of our Lord 1741 . J. DOLBEN . Sealed and Delivered , being first duly stamped , in the Presence of JAMES AFFLICK , THO . BURLINGSON . Middlesex . These are to certify , that the Name of the within mentioned Joseph Redding is this Day entred in my Office , pursuant to the Statute in such Case made and provided .

As near as I can guess it is about forty Pole . Q . What did you observe there ? Redding . I saw my Son and Mr Annesley coming up , - I did not know who they were till they came up . Q . Did you see them immediately after the Accident happened ? Redding . Yes , presently . Q . How did they behave upon this Occasion ? Redding . They were so troubled they could hardly wag or speak ; my Son said he was afraid the Man was killed ; and he said to Mr Annesley , how did you do it ? Mr Annesley said , I did not think of the Gun 's going off . Q . You say you saw them coming up , did you observe them when the Accident happen 'd ? Redding . Yes , I look 'd at them all the while . Q . How was the Gun carried when it went off ? Redding . Just as I may hold this Sword . ( Holding it in his Right-Hand , hanging down near the Pocket a few Inches from his Body , almost upon a Level ) He had it in one Hand , as I have the Sword now . Q . Did he express himself concerned ? Redding . He was so concerned , that he did not run ten Pole , before he fell down and beat himself thus upon the Belly , and said , What have I done ? Q . Did you ever hear of any Quarrel between him and this Man ? Redding . Never . Serj . Gapper . ( on the cross examination ) Where did you stand when the Accident happened ? Redding . In Chantry Mead . Q . Is there not a Hedge between Chentry Mead and Hare Mead ? Redding . Yes , I believe there is . Q . How could you see through the Hedge ? Redding . It is a new Hedge not above a Yard high , and I could see any thing that was doing there , as clear as I can see you . Q . Was Annesley with his Face or his Back towards you ? Redding . He was Side-ways to me . Serj . Gapper . Why Chantry Mead is North of Hare Mead , then his Face could not be towards you ? Redding . No , I say his Side was towards me . Serj . Gapper . You were speaking as to this being a Manour ; how do you know it to be a Manour ? Redding . Because there have been Courts kept there . Serj . Gapper . By whom ? Redding . By Sir John Dolben . Q .

On which Side of Hare Mead does the River lie ; is it East , West , North , or South ? Redding . It is about South . Q . Does not this River belong to another Person ? Redding . No . Q . Has not Sir John granted the Fishery to any Body ? Redding . I rent the Fishery , the Fishery belongs to me . Q . Do you depute your Son to look after this ? Redding . No , Sir John Dolben deputes him . Q . How came Sir John Dolben to appoint your Son to be Game-Keeper ? Redding . Because they robbed me daily . Q . Have you assign 'd that Fishery to any Body ? Redding . No , I have not . Q . Who owns the Land on the other Side ? Redding . I believe my Lord Dunmore is the Landlord . Q . Was you standing up when the Gun went off , or sitting ? Redding . I was standing up . [ William Duffell sworn . ] Q . Do you know John Egglestone , the Son of Thomas Egglestone ? Duffell . Yes . Q . Have you ever had any Conversation with him about this Matter ? Duffell . Yes : On this Occasion he was at my House , I desired him to tell the Truth : He said he would , and then told me , that as he and his Father were fishing , they saw the Prisoner , Redding , coming up ; that he desired his Father to give him the Net , and he would run away with it , but his Father would not let him ; that then Redding came up and demanded the Net : that Thomas Egglestone said he should not have it , and then threw the Net into the River , and in the mean Time , the other Gentleman came up and shot him ; that John Egglestone jump 'd into the River and cut the Line of the Net to pull it out on the other Side ; and that when the Gun went off and his Father dropped down , Mr Redding said to the other Gentleman , Lord , Sir , What have you done ! and then they both run Home : Mr Abraham Egglestone , who was present , ask 'd him if he saw Mr Annesley pull the Trigger of the Gun ; and John Egglestone answered , that he could not tell . I ask 'd him if there was any Quarrel or Words that had passed between them , and he said no . - I said it was very surprizing to me , that this Gentleman should come and shoot his Father and nothing more pass between them ; I then asked him in what Manner he held the Gun ; he had a Stick in his Hand , and showed in what Manner the Gun was held in his Hand , thus , ( in his Right-Hand , the Arm hanging down near the Pocket , some Inches from his Body , and near upon a Level ; which was the same Manner that old Redding said the Gun was held ) I ask 'd if he thought he did it wilfully , he said he could not tell . Q . How long was this Discourse after this Accident happened ? Duffell . About four Hours . Q . Did you ever see this John Egglestone before , for he says he knows nothing of you ? Duffell . I have known him these eight Years , and he has been frequently at my House . Q . What Character has he ? Duffell . I can not say much in his Behalf ; his Father could not manage him at all . Q . What Business did he follow ? Duffell . His Father was a Carpenter , and he worked with him . Q . When did he leave Staines ? Duffell . Soon after this Accident happened . Q . Where has he been ever since ? Duffell . I have seen him at the White-Horse , in Pickadilly ; and I heard at Staines , that he was sent for to London . Q . Did the Man at the White-Horse come down for him to Staines ? Duffell . I did not see him there . Mr Serj . Gapper . You say he was at your House , who gave you Directions about advising him to speak the Truth ? Duffell . No-body : Mr Abraham Egglestone advised him the same thing . Q . Who was there ? Duffell . No-body but Mr Abraham Egglestone and myself ; I was desired to go and see how the Man came to be killed , and John Egglestone came to me about eight o'Clock . Mr Serj . Gapper . You say he could not say it was wilfully done , so he did not say it was accidentally done ? Duffell . No , he did not say it was . Mr Brown . Do you apprehend he had hold of the Gun by the Barrel near the Lock ? Duffell . I understood by Egglestone 's Manner of holding the Stick , that he meant that Mr Annesley had hold of the Gun about the Middle of the Barrel . [ John Dalton sworn . ] Q . What Discourse had you with young Egglestone ? Dalton . On the Sunday , when the Prisoner at the Bar was carried to Laleham to be examined , I went there : The Company dined at the Grey-Hound at Laleham , I stay 'd and drank half a Pint of Wine there , and immediately afterwards John Egglestone came to the Door , and called me out of the Room , and said he wanted to speak with me . When I came out , he said he wanted to ask my Advice concerning this Accident : I said , I wonder you should ask my Advice , when you have Relations to advise with ; he said , I thought sit to ask you as you are my Master . While we were talking , Samuel Sylvester came out , and said , I was persuading the Boy to sell his Father 's Blood ; the Boy said , What do you mean , you Fool you , my Master is persuading me to no such thing . I then asked him , whether he thought it was accidentally done or not ; he said , he believed it was accidental , rather than any other thing . I said to him , well , if you think so , you will be examined when you come before Sir Thomas Reynell , I desire you would not forswear yourself , but be very careful what you say . Q . What Character has the Boy ? Dalton . He was very irregular , and used to lie out . Q . How do you know that ? Dalton . He was my Servant . Q . What Trade are you ? Dalton . I am a Butcher . Mr Serj . Gapper . You say he has a bad Character ; do you think he would forswear himself ? Dalton . I can say nothing to that . Mr Serj . Gapper . When was it you had this Discourse with him ? Dalton . On the Sunday , at the Grey-Hound at Laleham . Mr Serj . Gapper . Was there any talk of Money then ? Dalton . Yes , the Boy said he had been offered Money . Q . But you say , he said he would not sell his Father 's Blood ? Dalton . No , I said Samuel Sylvester came and said I was persuading him to sell his Father 's Blood ; and the Boy said my Master did not persuade me to any such Thing . Mr Serj . Gapper . Are you sure that this is true ? Dalton . Yes I am , I think I am in my Senses . Mr Serj . Gapper . What did you say to him afterwards ? Dalton . I told him he had lost his Father and had no Friend to take care of him , and he knew best what he had to do . Q . Did not you say it was better to take Money , than hang the Man ? Dalton . No , I said , I thought by what he told me , that the Man was in no Danger of being hang 'd , and therefore he had better take Money than endeavour to hang a Man , that he thought did not do it designedly . ( Mr Higgs , belonging to the Clerk of the Peace being sworn , produc 'd the Book wherein all the Game-Keepers of all the Manours in the County of Middlesex are enter 'd ; ( Reads ) Sir John Dolben of Northampton , Baronet , to Joseph Redding the younger , dated 2 July , 1741 . Enter 'd 29 January , 1741 . [ Mr Richard Chester sworn . ] Q . Give us an Account of what you know of this Matter . Chester . I drove the Chaise , from my own House , to the Red-Lion at Brentford , and then to the Grey-Hound at Laleham ; I went up to young Egglestone , and ask 'd him how this unfortunate Thing happen 'd ; whether it was done designedly , or happen 'd by Accident . Q . Where was this ? Chester . This was at Laleham ; he said he believed it was accidental , for he did not believe any Gentleman in cool Blood would do any such thing wilfully . Q . Do you know any Thing with respect to the Net ? Chester . I think he said Mr Annesley was stooping to the Net , in order to take it , and the Gun went off . Q . Did he say any Thing how Mr Annesley held the Gun ? Chester . I had the Chaise-Whip in my Hand , and desired him to show me how Mr Annesley held the Gun ; he took the Whip in his Hand and held it so , ( which was much the same Position as Redding and Duffell said he held it in ) I think it was rather nearer the Handle than the Middle of the Whip that he held it . Mr Brown . Did you see the Wound ; Where was the Wound ? Chester . I understood it was somewhere about the Hip . Mr Brown . I ask you whether you think he could have shot him in the Hip , if he had held the Gun that Way ? Chester . I think he could not have shot him there , if he had held it any other Way . Mr Brown . Pray do you know of any Money being offered by any Person in your Presence to young Egglestone ? Chester . No . Mr Brown . Nor any Reward of any Sort ? Chester . No . - My Lord , I had forgot to mention one thing . After this , Egglestone spoke to Mr Annesley the Prisoner , and shook Hands with him ; and Egglestone said he was very sorry for what had happened , but said he did not think he did it designedly , and then drank a Glass of Wine to him . Court . Did they shake Hands , or drink the Wine first ? Chester . Both at the same Time as near as could be . Mr Serj . Gapper . Did you see this ? Chester . I did see it . Mr Brown . I ask you whether the Prisoner at the Bar is not married to your Daughter-in-Law ? Chester . My Lord , if your Lordship thinks I ought to answer this Question , I will . Court . The Relation is very small , but if they insist on their Question , you must answer it . Chester . The Prisoner is married to my Daughter-in-Law . Q . They ask this Question in Hopes of its being of Service to them in another Affair , for it can not be of any in this ; though I hope he has got a very good Wife . [ John Paterson sworn . ] Q. Mr Paterson , I think you did attend the Coroner 's Inquest , upon this Occasion ; please to give an Account how Egglestone behaved then , and what he said . Mr Paterson . My Lord , I will ; but first beg leave to make an Apology , for appearing as a Witness on behalf of the unhappy Gentleman for whom I am concerned as an Attorney ; I do it because , in an Affair of so great Consequence to him , I think he has a right to my Evidence ; and I do it with less Scruple , as I am his Attorney without Fee or Reward . My Lord , on the 4th of May , I went to Staines to attend the Coroner 's Jury ; though , as I had not Time to enquire into the Fact , and prepare for Mr Annesley 's Defence , I could do him but little Service more , than by cross examining the Witnesses for the Crown , and making Observations on their Evidence ; one of the Witnesses was John Egglestone , who has been examined here . - Court . As to any Thing in his Behaviour you may give Evidence , but not of any Thing that was reduced into writing . Mr Paterson . I can only speak as to what he said before the Coroner , and I admit the Depositions taken at that Time , were reduced into writing by the Coroner or his Clerk . [ Mr King the Coroner sworn , who produced his Minutes of the Depositions made before him . ] Mr Serj . Gapper . Were these drawn up when Egglestone was examined , or afterwards ? Mr King . They were not drawn up afterwards , they were drawn up at the same Time . Q . Read them as far as they relate to John Egglestone . Mr Serj . Gapper . Did Egglestone sign his Deposition ? Mr King . He did not . Mr Serj . Gapper . As this Gentleman is Coroner , what he has taken down ought to be signed by the Deponent ; and if it is not , I humbly apprehend it can not be read . Council for the Prisoner . The Gentlemen may choose whether they will have the Minutes read , or whether we shall give Parole Evidence , to prove what Egglestone said at that Time . [ The Council for the Prosecutor perferring the Minutes , they were read , and are as follows . ] MAY 4 , 1742 . Depositions relating to the Death of Thomas Egglestone , who was shot in the Parish of Staines , in the County of Middlesex . John Egglestone , Son of the Deceased , living at Staines , faith , that on Saturday , the 1st of May , he and his Father went a fishing in one Sylvester 's Grounds , and says , that one Joseph Redding came up and laid hold of his Father , and demanded his Net , upon which his Father said he should not have it ; then the Prisoner , James Annesley , came up , and said , Damn your Blood , surrender your Net , or you are a dead Man ; and upon his Refusal , the Prisoner held up his Piece to his Shoulder , and presented his Piece to the said Egglestone , near to the middle Part of his Body , on his left Side , and shot the said Egglestone , who died presently after . Says , the Gun was cocked before he came , and that the Piece went off before his Father 's Refusal to deliver the Net . He says the Deceased clapp 'd his Hand to his Side , and said , You Rogue , you have shot me , I am a dead Man . That after the Discharge of the Piece , his Father dropp 'd instantly : Says , that when he saw his Father shot , he took his Knife , and cut the String of the Net and jumped into the River ; upon which the Prisoner said , he has got the Net , and went to strike at him with the butt End of the Gun , and said , Let us go on the other Side of the River , and fetch it . Says , that Redding had hold of Deceased by the Collar , when the Piece went off . Says , he was not offered any Money by any Body . Council for the Prisoner . This is the 4th of May , and he now says , that on the second of May he was offered Money at Laleham . Mr Serj . Gapper . Are these all the Minutes that you took ? King . My Clerk was there , these were all that he mention 'd that he took ; if I may say any Thing more from my Memory I will do it . Q . Then we will go upon the Parole Evidence . Mr Serj . Gapper . When an Officer has taken Things down in Writing it is of dangerous Consequence to admit Parole Evidence to be given of the same Things . Q . We do not insist upon it . [ The Reverend Mr Eusebius Williams sworn . ] Q . Sir , do you know John Fisher ? Williams . Yes . Q . Had you any talk with him about Egglestone 's being killed ? Williams . I happen 'd to be at Laleham , and heard the Depositions that were made before Sir Thomas Reynell : Fisher said if he was examin 'd before the Justice he would declare what Egglestone had said to him . Q . What was that ? Mr Williams . Fisher told me that Egglestone said he did not be lieve the Gentleman kill 'd his Father designedly ; but that it was an Accident . Q . Do you know how this young Man Egglestone came from Stains to London , and who has had the keeping of him since ? Williams . I know nothing but by hearsay . Q . Was you never at the White-Horse in Pickadilly ? Williams . I never was there since this Accident . [ Mr Betbune call 'd . ] Mr Serj . Gapper . My Lord , this is another Person that is brought to contradict the Evidence of Egglestone , in what he said with respect to the Position of the Gun . Prisoner 's Council . Egglestone said the Gun was pointed downward . Now we shall shew you from the Nature of the Wound that it is morally impossible it should be so , for the Wound is slanting upwards . [ James Betbune sworn . ] Q . Sir , You are I think a Surgeon at Brentford : Did you see the Body of this Egglestone that was kill 'd at Staines ? Mr Betbune . On Sunday after the Accident , My Lord , I happen 'd to be at Laleham , and Sir Thomas Reynell gave me Leave to come in and hear the Depositions : I was afterwards sent for by Mr Perkins a Surgeon at Staines , to attend at the opening of the Body before the Coroner ; there were several of the Coroner 's Jury in the Room . I found the Wound on the left Side , about an Inch and an Half below the Ridge of the Hip-Bone ; the Wound I apprehend to be about an Inch and an Half wide ; I found it went into the Cavity of the Belly . Q . Did the Wound go upwards or downwards into the Belly ? Betbune . When I found it went into the Cavity of the Belly , I remember 'd in what manner Egglestone held the Gun when he was before Sir Thomas Reynell , to show how Mr Annesley held it when he fir 'd : I remember very well he held it to his Shoulder slanting downwards ; I attempted to put my Probe into the Wound in the same direction as he described the Gun , but there was no Passage for it in that Position , it would not go in downwards ; then I put it in in this Manner cross the Belly , and it went in without Obstruction , and then upwards and it went in with the same Ease , in this Manner . I observ 'd several large Blisters , full of black Serum on the right Side , opposite to the Place where the Shot went in , the Blisters which were on the opposite Side , were three or four Inches higher than where the Wound was , - the Wound was on the left Side , and the Blisters on the right ; when I found this was so plain to me , I desired it might be as plain to the Jury and every one there , as it was to my self , because this was a Matter of Fact and not of Judgment , and I desired the Foreman to come and put the Probe in and try , he did so and found the Wound as I have described it : I was the more careful in this , because I had observed the Evidence that the Boy gave on the Sunday , and there was some Variation between that and the Nature of the Wound , therefore I desired them to take the more Notice of it , and said , Gentlemen , I shall have Occasion to speak to this by and by , and therefore I desire you would mind what I say to you . Q . What do you think those Blisters on the other Side were occasioned by . Mr Bethune . I apprehend they were occasioned by the Force of the Powder , and that if the Shot had gone through , it must have come out three or four Inches higher on the other Side than it went in . Mr Serj . Gapper . According to your Account , could he , holding the Muzzle of the Gun upwards , have made this Wound ? Mr Bethune . It could not have made it with the Muzzle downward . Q . Did you observe how the Wound was upon the Bone , and whether there were any Shot remaining in the Wound ? Mr Bethune . No Sir , But I found some Shot in the Cavity of the Belly . Mr Brown . Now the Question is , Whether the Shot , coming upon this Bone , might not be thrown upwards ? Mr Bethune . No , for the Shot went through the Bone , so that the Gun must have been held obliquely , pointing upwards ; the Shot could not have gone through in that Direction if the Muzzle of the Gun had pointed downwards ; this is not Matter of Judgement , but I have given you Demonstration of it . Mr Serj . Gapper . You say the Wound went from the left Side to the right , and that if the Muzzle of the Gun was downwards the Wound would be in the same Manner . Mr Bethune . Certainly Sir , if the Muzzle of the Gun is held downward , the Shot can not go upward . Foreman of the Jury . He makes it appear that the Prisoner could not hold the Gun to his Shoulder , but that it was held horizontally , and that it was impossible for him to wound him in the Manner the Boy has described , if the Muzzle of the Gun had been pointed downward . Mr Bethune . I beg Leave to speak a few Words more to your Lordship . While I was giving in this Evidence before the Coroner and his Jury , if your Lordship remembers , I said I had showed them how the Wound was , therefore I desired them to consider how Consistent it was with the Evidence that Mr Egglestone had given : I believe I proved it to the Coroner 's Jury and others that were there , that it was impossible it could be done in that Manner , if the Gun was held as he said , to his Shoulder , upon that he comes up again , and , says he , the Gentleman stooped when he did it . Council for the Prisoner . This shews how he departed from what he had said , for he said first that Mr Annesley stood upright when he fired , and then that he stooped in order to make his Evidence correspond with the Wound . [ John Perkins , Surgeon , sworn . ] Q . Did you see the Body of Thomas Egglestone ? Perkins . I opened the Body on the 4th of May , and on Inspection , I found one Wound of about an Inch and an half Diameter ; on the lower Part of the left Side , it passed thro ' the Spine of the Os Ilium about an Inch and an Half below the Ridge of the Hip . Bone : I put in my Probe seven or eight Inches , by which and likewise upon Inspection , I found it run horizontal , a little upon the ascending : I put my two Fingers into the Cavity of the Bone and shewed the Jury how it was , and observ 'd on the contrary Side four or five Blisters , which I think to be occasioned by the Force of the Powder from the other Side ; but the Shot did not go through the Skin . Court . I ask you whether these Blisters were higher or lower than the Wound ? Mr Perkins . Four or five Inches higher , my Lord . Mr Brown . Do you think these Blisters were occasioned by the Shot ? Perkins . I apprehend they were , because there were no other Blisters on any other Part of the Body . [ Mr King the Coroner called again . ] Q . Was any Application made to you at any Time to send Mr Annesley a Prisoner to Newgate ? Mr King . Yes , I think it was Mr Giffard , he came along with another Gentleman , whose Name I think is Carrington . Q . What , Captain Carrington ? Mr King . I believe it was : I said , I think the Gentleman is secure enough : ( there was a Lord mentioned , but I can not remember that he was named : Mr Giffard wisely kept him from saying who it was ) I thought it was too severe to send him to Newgate , and said that Sir Thomas Reynell was the Justice of Peace who committed him , and he had taken sufficient Care about it . [ Paul Keating sworn . ] Q . Do you know any Thing of Egglestone ? Keating . Yes . Q . Where did you come acquainted with him ? Keating . At the White Horse in Pickadilly . Q . What Countryman are you ? Keating . I came from Ireland on Board a Merchantman from Waterford : I was recommended to the Earl of - to say what I know as a Witness about the Estate . Q . How came you to the White Horse ? Keating . There was one Lawler that came over in the same Ship . When I came to Town , I went and enquired for him at the Earl of - 's , and he sent me to the White Horse in Pickadilly to live , and there I came acquainted with Egglestone . Q . After your Acquaintance do you remember any Conversation with him , about what he was to have for swearing in this Cause ? Keating . I do , my Lord , remember mighty well ; a little Time after he came to the Inn , he and I got acquainted together , and went out a walking to see the Town , and particularly on a Sunday Morning ; the Sunday after he came to Pickadilly . Q . What Month was that in ? Keating . In the Month of May : I believe it was the second Sunday in May : as we were walking abroad I asked him how he came to live there , says he , I am here at the Expence of the Earl of - Court . This is not proper : If you can call any Body to contradict Egglestone you may , but this is reflecting upon a Noble Person 's Character . Q . Did he tell you how he came to be at that Inn ? Keating . He told me that Mr Williams , who keeps the White Horse , brought him from Staines , and that he should be very well provided for , if he would prosecute the Gentleman , who is now in Custody , for this Murder , and he desired I might contrive some way that he might get the Money secured , and I wrote two or three Drafts of Notes for 200 l. and he took Copies of them . Q . How came he to take Copies of them ? Keating . Because I did not care my Hand should be known . I have a Copy of one of them in my Pocket . [ Reads . ] I Promise to pay to Mr Thomas Egglestone [ that is his elder Brother ] or his Order , at or upon the 10th Day of June next , the Sum of 200 l. Sterling for Value receiv 'd from his deceased Father and him in Carpenters Work , & c. Witness my Hand this 10th Day of May , 1742 . This was to be signed either by Williams or my Lord - Q . Do you know of any Discourse with Patrick Lawler ? Keating . Yes , he is my Lord - 's Servant . Court . What Lawler said is not Evidence , unless to contradict him , and he has not been examined . Q . Have you ever seen the Earl of - at the White Horse . Keating . He is there often . Q . What , has the Earl of - any Thing to do there ? Keating . His Coach and Horses are kept there . Q . How long have they stood there ? Keating . They stand there constantly . Mr Serj . Gapper . What was that Note for ? Keating . It is only a Copy of what I wrote for Egglestone , for as I told the Court before , I did not care that my Hand should be seen in any such Thing as Bribery and Corruption . Mr Serj . Gapper . Where was this Note sign 'd ? Keating . I can not say whether it was sign 'd or not , he told me it was to be sign 'd . Q . Did not you put this into Egglestone 's Head ? Keating . No , upon my Oath I did not . Mr. Brown . Did not you receive Money to go somewhere , and you and he went and spent the Money ? Keating . I receiv 'd a Crown to go to Woolwich . Q . How came you not to go to Woolwich ? Keating . I had not a mind to go . Mr Serj . Gapper . So you had a mind to make Egglestone drunk with this Crown ? Keating . That is a different Case . Q . Did not you treat him ? Keating . Yes , I did . Q . What Reason had you to treat him ? Keating . Because he had no Money of his own . Mr Serj . Gapper . So you had a Crown to go to Woolwich and did not go ? Keating . I did not go indeed . The Evidence for the Prisoners being gone through . Court . If the Jury should be of Opinion that the Gun went off by Accident , the Homicide must , in Point of Law , be either Manslaughter or Chance-Medley ; I should be glad in that Case to make it Chance-Medley ; but in order to that it must appear , that what Mr Annesley was doing , was perfectly lawful , otherwise he will be guilty of Manslaughter . The other Prisoner , Redding , had certainly , by Virtue of his Deputation , and by Force of the Acts of Parliament made for the Preservation of the Game , Authority to seize the Deceased , who was clearly acting in Violation of those Laws . But it is doubtful whether the Authority of a Game-Keeper being personal , the other Prisoner acted lawfully in assisting him . The Substance of the Arguments by the Council for the Prisoners , ( viz . Mr Hume Campbel , Mr Serj . Hayward , Mr Clarke , Mr Wyrley , and Mr Smith ) was as follows . My Lord , although a Game-Keeper 's Authority be personal ; we submit to your Lordship , that as the Deceased was confessedly doing an unlawful Act , Mr Annesley 's catching at the String of the Net , which the Deceased had thrown away , and which might be only to prevent its falling into the Water , was not such a Trespass in him , as will alter the Nature of the Consequence , and make that Manslaughter , which appears to have been in Fact a most unfortunate Accident . We humbly apprehend , my Lord , that it is not necessary , that the Act Mr Annesley was about when the Accident happened , should be strictly legal ; if it was an Act of an indifferent Nature , not an unlawful one , we hope it will be sufficient to excuse him from the Guilt of Manslaughter . If a Man throws a Stone into a Place of publick Resort , and kills another , that will be Manslaughter , because the Act itself was unlawful , supposing that dismal Consequence had not followed it . But if a Man is playing at Bowls , and undesignedly kills another , there as the first Act was of an indifferent Nature , the Law will not impute the Accident consequential to it as a Crime . As to Mr Annesley 's entring the Close that belonged to Sylvester , whatever it might be with Regard to him , it was an Act of an indifferent Nature with Respect to the Deceased , who claimed no Property in the Ground , and consequently had no more Right to be there than Mr Annesley , unless you will suppose him to have had the Owner 's Consent , which , as it was not proved , may and ought , with equal Justice , to be supposed in Favour of the Prisoner . The young Man 's Evidence being put out of the Case , ( and considering the Manner in which he contradicted himself , and has been contradicted by others , what he says we apprehend ought to stand for nothing ) Mr Annesley 's Act appears to be no more than stooping to prevent the String of the Net from falling into the River ; in doing of which , suppose a Pistol had gone off in his Pocket , would it not be the hardest Case in the World , to say that this Accident should make him guilty of Manslaughter . But allowing it necessary that the Act Mr Annesley was doing must be lawful , we hope to shew your Lordship that Mr Annesley 's Interposition in this Case was so . There are two Acts of Parliament relating to the Game , applicable to this Case ; the one made in the 22d and 23d Years of Charles II . Chap . 25. and the other in the 4th and 5th Years of William and Mary , Chap . 23 . The first recites that divers disorderly Persons , laying aside their lawful Trades , betake themselves to the stealing of Conies , Hares , Pheasants , Partridges , and other Game , with Nets and other Engines . For Remedy whereof it enacts , That all Lords of Manours may , by writing under their Hands and Seals , authorize one or more Game-Keeper , or Game-Keepers , within their Manours ; who being so authorized , may seize such Nets , or other Engines , as shall be used by any Person or Persons prohibited to keep or use the same . Then it recites , that divers idle , disorderly , and mean People , do betake themselves to the stealing of Fish out of Ponds , and other several Waters and Rivers , to the great Damage of the Owners thereof . Therefore it enacts , that if any Person or Persons shall use a Casting-Net in any River , & c. without the Consent of the Lord or Owner of the said Water ; and being thereof convicted before any Justice of the Peace , shall give the Owner such Satisfaction ( not exceeding treble Damages ) as the Justice shall appoint , or be committed to the House of Correction . And that it shall be lawful for the Justice to destroy all such Nets , or other Engines , wherewith such Offenders shall be taken or apprehended . The other Act of Parliament recites , that divers good and necessary Laws had been made for Preservation of the Game ; notwithstanding which , or for want of the due Execution thereof , the Game had been very much destroyed by many idle Persons , who afterwards betake themselves to Robberies , Burglaries , or other like Offences , and neglect their lawful Employments . For Remedy whereof it enacts , That no Person , or Persons , shall have or keep any Net or Engine for taking of Fish , except the Owner or Occupier of a River or Fishery . And that it shall be lawful for such Owner or Occupier , and all and every other Person , or Persons , by him or them , for that Purpose appointed , to seize , detain , and keep , to his and their own Use and Uses , every Net or Engine which they shall find used , or in the Custody or Possession of any Person or Persons whatsoever , fishing in any River without the Consent of the Owner or Occupier . Now the Question which your Lordship puts upon us to argue , is , Whether a Person duly authorized under these Acts of Parliament , being resisted in the Execution of his Office , can legally call any other Person to his Assistance . Your Lordship will consider we are arguing in Favour of Life , and therefore will construe these Laws in the most beneficial Manner for the Prisoner , and the rather because such Construction will tend to put the Laws themselves in Force , which were intended for securing Men in their Property from the Violation of idle and disorderly Persons . These Acts suppose the Offenders to be desperate People , for it describes them to be such as afterwards betake themselves to Robberies and Burglaries , and likewise supposes ( what is also true in Fact , ) that they go in Numbers to destroy the Game . That Circumstance seems to imply that a Game-Keeper , or other Person duly appointed , may , in such Cases , call in other Persons to his Assistance . To construe the Law otherwise , would render it ineffectual , for it is absurd to suppose , that every Lord of a Manour , or Owner of a Fishery , should appoint as many Game-Keepers as there may be Persons inclined to invade his Property . This would entirely tend to defeat the Security intended by the Law , and therefore can never be agreeable to the Meaning of the Legislators . As these are late Acts of Parliament , it can not be expected , that we should produce Cases directly in Point , and Resolutions of the Judges , on the Construction of those Acts in this Question . But suppose upon some of the Acts of Parliament made against Smugglers , an Officer of the Revenue , or at the Common Law a Constable , being resisted in the Execution of his Office , calls in other Persons in the Neighbourhood to his Assistance , and Mischief or Death ensues ; might not those Persons avail themselves of the Authority vested in the Officer or Constable , so as to be justified in what they do , for the manifest Support and Execution of the Law ? A Man has undoubtedl y a Right to drive away Cattle , which he finds Damage faisant in his Ground . Suppose then he should desire a Stranger to assist him , could the Owner of the Cattle maintain an Action against the Stranger for the Trespass in driving his Cattle ? Suppose , in the present Case , the Deceased had not unfortunately been killed , and had brought an Action against the Prisoners for an Assault , might not the Defendants ( one of which was Game-Keeper ) have pleaded specially , and justified under the Act of Parliament ? And surely , whatever in pleading would have been a Justification in such a Case as this will be a sufficient Excuse . But we apprehend , that in all Cases where the Law makes Offences punishable by Justices of the Peace , whoever sees a Person committing such an Offence , has a Right , without any special Authority , to take him up , and carry him , together with the Instrument of his Offence , before a Justice , in order to his Conviction , and that whatever is necessary for this Purpose is lawful . If this was not Law , Offenders would in most Cases escape with Impunity ; for observing themselves to be discovered , they would hardly stay till the Observer could resort to a proper Authority ; and being mean and unknown Persons , might never afterwards be found . Even the young Man , who was so very forward in giving his Evidence , admits that his Father and he were actually fishing , that is , committing an Offence against these Acts of Parliament . That Redding , who had a legal Authority , came up first to the Deceased and demanded the Net , that the Deceased refused to deliver it ; and that whilst they were struggling for the Net , Mr Annesley came up and snatched at it . Upon the Whole , we hope Mr Annesley was well warranted to go to Redding 's Assistance , and that the unhappy Accident that fell out at that Time , shall not be imputed to him as a Crime , but construed to be no more than Chance-Medley . The Substance of the Arguments by the Council for the Prosecutor , viz . Mr Serj . Gapper , Mr Serj . Wynne , Mr Brown , and Mr Johnson was as follows . My Lord , The Council for the Prisoners have undertaken to justify under two Acts of Parliament . As to the 22d and 23d of Charles II , we beg leave to observe , that the Clause empowering Lords of Manours to appoint Game-Keepers with Authority to seize Nets , does not extend to Fisheries . The Clause which relates to Fishing , only directs that the Offenders shall be punished upon Conviction before a Justice of Peace , but does not empower any one to seize either them or their Nets . The regular Way undoubtedly is to lay a Complaint before a Justice of the Peace , who is to grant his Warrant for apprehending the Offender , and then upon Conviction he may destroy the Net . Besides , it was sworn by old Redding , that this was his Fishery , if so , Sir John Dolben had no Authority at all to appoint a Game-Keeper to take care of it , and consequently , even the Deputation itself is void . But if it was not void , yet still the Power is personal , and can not be delegated to another , and therefore can not serve to excuse Mr Annesley , who appears to have acted officiously , without being called upon by any Body . As to the other Act of Parliament , the 4th and 5th of William and Mary , that no Ways relates to Game-Keepers , but only empowers the Owners or Occupiers of Fisheries , or Persons by them for that Purpose appointed , to seize the Nets ; so that this Power is confined to old Redding himself , and it does not appear he has appointed either of the Prisoners , and therefore , as they had no Authority at all , they were Trespassers , and must answer for the Consequences . As to the liberal Construction of the Acts of Parliament , which the Gentlemen contend for , we say that , at the Common Law , every Man had a Right to fish in Rivers ; and consequently , those Statutes are an Abridgment of the Common Law , and therefore to be strictly construed . By the same Rule of Construction which they insist upon , any Man may claim a Right to come every Day and search another 's House for Nets and Engines for destroying of Game . But what Murders , besides other Inconveniences , must be the Consequence of such an unlimitted Power , we leave all the World to judge . We admit that this is a new Case , and therefore the Cases put of a Constable , whose Office is as ancient as any in the Kingdom , are by no Means parallel . We insist therefore that the Prisoners , at least Mr. Annesley , having been wrong Doers , must answer for the Consequence , which being the Death of one of his Majesty 's Subjects , make them guilty of Manslaughter , supposing the Gun went off by accident . Then Mr Hume Campbell said in Reply . My Lord , I beg leave to trouble you with a few Words , on Behalf of the unhappy Gentleman , who stands charged before you with a Crime which affects his Life . If that Consequence was the Motive for the Charge , he may rely upon the Justice of this Court as his Security ; to your Justice he has surrender 'd himself , and equally trusts in that and his Innocence . In arguing the Point now before the Court , I may take it for granted , that the Gun went off by accident , without Mr Annesley 's knowing it ; and only consider whether his interposing to assist Redding was or was not lawful . My Lord , I take it for a general Rule , that all Persons on request not only may , but are bound by their Duty and Allegiance , to assist legal Officers in the Executionof their Duty . I shall not repeat any of the Evidence ; the Court will remember that a Request of the Game-Keeper 's , or what amounts to such , has been proved . I mentioned the Case of a Constable , which the Gentlemen of the other Side , endeavour to distinguish from that of a Game-Keeper , by saying that his Power is great , and that his Office is very antient . I admit both these Positions , but insist that his Power does not arise from the Antiquity , but from the Legality of his Office . A Game-Keeper is a legal Officer , particularly appointed under the Acts of Parliament for the Preservation of the Game ; he is for that Purpose fully empowered to put the Laws relating to the Game , in Execution : No-body can legally resist him , and consequently the Deceased and his Son were doubly criminal ; first , in breaking the Law , and then in resisting the legal Officer , who came to put that Law in Force . What did Mr Annesley do in this Case ? He stopped to take up the Net which the Deceased had unlawfully thrown into the Water , to prevent the Game Keeper from seizing it . Egglestone had abandoned it ; and will any one maintain , that when a Trespasser throws away the Instrument of his Crime , it is unlawful in another Person to take it up ? Nay the Assistant of him to whom the Statute gives it ? They say a Man may as well go every Day into People 's Houses , under Pretence of searching for Nets , & c. No , they can not do that by Law , every Man 's House is his Castle ; and the Law has provided that he shall not be molested there without a special Authority . Nor is there the same Reason for that , as there is for seizing Offenders in the actual Commission of the Offence . The very Case they put , implies the Offender may be found and come at by the ordinary Forms ; but in the other , he may not be known , and will hardly stay till you apply for a Warrant to apprehend him . So that the Necessity of the Thing makes that reasonable and lawful in the one Case , which , for want of that Necessity , is not so in the other . That a special Authority , My Lord , is not necessary in all Cases , will hardly be disputed ; a Constable , if the Law is broke in his Presence , may by Virtue of his general Power take cognizance of the Offence and arrest the Offender . In the present Case the Game-Keeper who is a legal Officer , and in nature of a Constable for this particular Purpose , saw the Deceased a Fishing , and consequently had a Right without any special Warrant to seize him , and when resisted , to call Mr Annesley to his Assistance . It is said , the Acts of Parliament are an Abridgement of the Common Law , and therefore should be construed strictly . My Lord , no Man , by the Common Law , had a Right to fish in another 's Property . It was an Offence at the Common Law ; It is Malum in se ; and the Statutes , that have been mentioned , only make that Offence Punishable by a Justice of Peace ; as they tend therefore to secure the Property which a Man had at the Common Law , they are an Addition to the Common Law , fixing a Punishment for the breach of Law ; and therefore to be so construed , as will best answer so salutary an End . If it is a new Case , as the Gentlemen seem to lay a stress upon it , let us consider what will be the Consequence of your Lordship 's Determination if it should be against us . The Law , my Lord , I apprehend will become vain and idle ; for if Offenders get together in any Number , it will be impossible for a Game-Keeper to restrain them . Nay , my Lord , the Law itself will become a Snare to all who have not the Act of Parliament in their Pocket , to tell them they must not interfere ; for suppose a Person legally appointed under an Act of Parliament , going to do his Duty is resisted , can it be imagined that his Fellow-Servant , his Neighbour , or his Friend , would not think himself justified , nay bound to assist him , when he sees his Authority thus trampled upon . At most , my Lord , it could be only an imprudent Act in Mr Annesley to interpose , but we hope your Lordship will not construe it to be such an unlawful Act , as will make him a Trespasser , and so guilty of Manslaughter . Your Lordship will please to observe that it depends entirely on the Credit of Egglestone , whether this Gentleman did any Thing or not . Before your Lordship directs the Jury as to this , it is my Duty to acquaint your Lordship , that there is an Indictment on the Coroner 's Inquest , and likewise an Indictment on the Black Act against the Prisoner Mr Annesley . Court . That is for shooting Maliciously : But there is no Evidence tending that way . Mr Serj . Gapper . My Lord , we desire to call some Evidence to support the Character of John Egglestone . Q . For what ? we have called no Witness to impeach it . Court . Have you not examined every Witness that has appeared to the Boy 's Character ? If you could have called more , it is to be supposed you would have done it . [ John Gardner Sworn . ] Mr Serj . Wynne . Do you know this young Egglestone ? Gardner . Yes . Mr Serj . Wynne . How long have you known him ? Gardner . Seven or eight Years . Mr Serj . Wynne . What is he as to his Honesty and Veracity ? Gardner . He is like other Boys , sometimes good , sometimes indifferent . Mr Serj . Wynne . I do not mean as to a little Unluckiness : But do you think from his general Behaviour that he would forswear himself ? Gardner . No , I do not think that he would . [ Thomas Sylvester sworn . ] Mr Serj . Wynne . Do you know this Egglestone ? Sylvester . Yes , I have known him about three Years , he lived by me at a Butcher 's . Mr. Serj . Wynne . What was he as to his Character and Behaviour ? Sylvester . He was sometimes idle and given to Play . Mr Serj . Wynne . Do you think he would forswear himself ? Sylvester . No , I do not think he would . [ Samuel Sylvester called . ] Mr Serj . Wynne . How long have you known this Boy . Samuel Sylvester . I have known this Boy a good while . Mr. Serj . Wynne . What is his general Character , do you think he would forswear himself ? Samuel Sylvester . I have had no Conversation with him , so I do not know what he is . [ William Palmer sworn . ] Mr Serj . Wynne . Do you know young Egglestone ? Palmer . Yes . Mr Serj . Wynne . How long have you known him ? Palmer . I have known him as long as I have known any Person of his Age : He came of very honest Parents . Mr Serj . Wynne . Do you think he would forswear himself ? Palmer . I do not think he would forswear himself . Q . Upon your Oath , do not you think he is much addicted to lying ? Palmer . Why , that is not taking a false Oath . [ Patrick Lawler sworn . ] Mr Serj . Wynne . Do you know Paul Keating ? Lawler . I have known him ever since the 18th of March last . Q . What is his general Character ? Lawler . I do not know his general Character : But I know he has behaved very bad of late . Q . Did you never offer him any Money to keep out of the Way , and not appear at this Trial ? Lawler . No , not I : But he said he would give them a Rowland for their Oliver . Q . Do you know what he meant by that ? Lawler . No , only that he said if my Lord - did not give him Money he would turn Evidence on the other Side . Q . What did you think he meant , when he said , if my Lord - did not give him Money he would turn Evidence of the other Side ? Why surely my Lord is not concerned in this Prosecution ! But pray , Sir , you have given a bad Account of Mr Keating , how came you and he acquainted . Lawler . This Keating and I came over together from Ireland in the same Ship , he told me there were some Evidences on Board that were coming over to swear away my Lord - 's Estate ; said he , there are three Women and two Men , and I have discovered the whole Thing ; how they are bribed to come here , and if I come to London , said he , I will give my Lord - an Account of it . Q. Pray , Sir , tell us what became of Keating when he came to Town ? Lawler . Soon after he arrived he found me out , and so I told Mr J'ans , I thought he might depend upon this Man , because I had seen him in Bristol ; said I , I speak to you about this Man , out of Charity , for he is very poor ; then says Mr J'ans , let him go to the White-Horse in Pickadilly ; and then he wanted Cloaths and Money ; and , says he , if they do not give me Cloaths and Money , I will swear that the Earl of - was to give a Note to young Egglestone to swear upon this Trial . Q . What do you think he meant by his giving a Rowland for an Oliver ? Whether it respected this Cause , or related to my Lord - 's Estate ? Lawler . I can not tell what he meant . Then the Court proceeded to sum up the Evidence as follows : Gentlemen of the Jury ; The Prisoners at the Bar , James Annesley and Joseph Redding , stand indicted for the wilful Murder of Thomas Egglestone , by giving him one Wound on the left Side of the Belly , in the Parish of Staines , of which he instantly died ; the Indictment sets forth that Annesley fired the Gun , and gave the Wound , and that Redding was assisting and abetting him in the doing of it : And they stand a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the same Murder ; and there is another Indictment against the Prisoner Annesley , for feloniously , wilfully and maliciously shooting this Man , against the Statute of the Ninth of King George the First : The first Evidence that is called by the Prosecutor is John Egglestone , he says his Father and he went a Fishing up the River till they came to Samuel Sylvester 's Ground , that they had a Net , and the String of the Net was about his Father 's Arm ; that when they got about the Middle of the Field , they saw the Prisoners coming up , that Redding came up first , and went to lay hold of the Net , and his Father threw the Net into the River , about two Yards from him ; and that Annesley then came up and said , Damn your Blood deliver your Net or you are a dead Man , and fired directly ; and that he shot him near the Bottom of the Belly on the left Side ; that his Father said , You Rogue , what have you done , I am a dead Man ; that he , the Witness , took a Knife out of his Pocket to cut the String of the Net from his Father 's Arm , and leaped into the River , and dragged the Net to the other Side of the River , and that Annesley said , The Rogue has got his Net , let us go on the other Side : that he saw Bettesworth , Fisher , and Bowles , on the other Side of the River ; and told them he believed his Father was dead ; that they came over the River and advised him to get a Surgeon ; upon which he went to one Charles Cole , but he did not come ; that then he went for Russel the Constable , to search for the Prisoners , and says they found the Prisoner Annesley in a Place about five or six Foot above the Floor , in an Out house , upon some Rubbish : That they carried him to the Round-House ; that he staid there all Night , and the next Day they carried him to Hounslow : He says the Gun was cock 'd , but he can not tell when he cock 'd it : He says Sir Thomas Reynell came into Hounslow while they were there , and that by his order , they went to the Grey-Hound at Laleham ; and that one Lane , Chester 's Son in Law , offer 'd him 100 l. a Year ; that Mr Annersley said he had not 100 l. a Year to give him , for he had more to provide for ; but he might have 50 l. a Year if he would not come against him ; he said he had no Conversation with one Duffell , but that he had with Dalton ; he says , he has sometimes dined at Williams 's Table ; and , that he did not tell Paul Keating , he was to have 200 l. The next Witness that is produced is John Bettesworth ; he says that Egglestone and his Son were in Sylvester 's Ground , on the other Side of the River , and he saw the Prisoners come out of Redding 's Ground into Sylvester 's , and when they were in the Middle of the Ground they run after them ; he says , Joseph Redding was too nimble for Egglestone 's Father , but whether he had him by the Collar he can not say : he says , that the Gun went off soon after Mr Annesley came up to old Egglestone ; he says , he saw the Smoak and Fire of the Gun ; and came up soon after Egglestone 's Father was shot . He says , he and Fisher , and Bowles , crossed the Water ; and that Annesley and Redding run away ; that Egglestone was not quite dead when he came over , but was not able to speak ; and says , he saw the Net on the other Side of the River : he says , there was a Place in a Wash-house , about six Foot from the Ground ; and there they found Mr Annesley ; that it is a Place where they put Hoops and other Rubbish : he says , that when Mr Annesley was taken , he said , he wished to be kill 'd , for being instrumental in the taking away an innocent Man 's Life . That about half an Hour before this Accident happened , he saw Mr Annesley offer to shoot at a Crow . John Fisher is call 'd next ; he says , he saw young Redding in the Ground with another Man ; but can not say that Annesley is the Man ; and that he saw there , two Men running after Egglestone and his Son ; that Redding laid his Hand , he thinks , on Egglestone 's Shoulder ; and there was a Sort of a Scuffle between them ; and he that carried the Gun , carried it in a Form to shoot ; and he that carried the Gun was very nigh Egglestone when the Gun went off : and he says , he saw Joseph Redding , and the other Man , go away ; and he says , he was at this Time 169 Yards off . It seems the Ground has been measured , and that is the Reason they are so particular in it : he says , Egglestone had Money offered him in his hearing ; he would have had a Hundred a Year ; but Mr Annesley said , he could not give him an Hundred a Year , for he had other People to do for : But he would give him Fifty ; and that Egglestone afterwards said , he would not sell his Father 's Blood ; and he said , that Egglestone afterwards told him , he believed the Gentleman did not do it wilfully ; but that the Boy , being afterwards ask 'd how he could swear against the Gentleman , when he had said he believed he did not do it wilfully ; he said , he did not remember any Thing of what he had said to him ; and he says he has been in the same Story ever since the Accident happen 'd , excepting that one Time . The next Witness , Gentlemen , is Samuel Sylvester ; and he says , when Mr Annesley came out of that Place , where he was found , he trembled very much ; he says , he rents this Land of one Sanders , who took it of Redding 's Father : he says , Egglestone used to work sometimes with his Father in the Business of a Carpenter , but that he has lived some Time at the White-Horse in Pickadilly . This is the Substance of the Evidence for the Prosecutor . The Prisoner Mr Annesley , in his own Defence , says , that he is very sorry for the Accident that has happened ; that these Persons were poaching in the Manour that belongs to Sir John Dolben ; that they did go up to them , but that you can not suppose he had any Spight against a Man he never saw in his Life ; he says that he had a Gun in his Hand , and that the Gun went off by Accident . The other Prisoner Redding , says , he is Game-keeper to Sir John Dolben ; that he saw these Men Fishing , and went to take the Net , that he heard the Gun go off , and saw the Man fall down , and then he said to Mr Annesley , Lord bless me , I hope you have not killed the Man ; and that it was done accidentally . To prove their Case , they called the following Witnesses . The first is , Mr Staples , he says , this is Sir John Dolben 's Manour , and that he has held Courts there . The next Witness , Gentlemen , was , Thomas Burlingson , and he proves a Deputation of the second of July 1741. from Sir John Dolben to Joseph Redding the younger , and thereby he is appointed his Game-keeper , to seize the Nets , & c. of any Person who shall destroy any Game , or Fish , in his Manour ; and in the Book which is kept for the Entry of these Things for the County of Middlesex ; it appears that the Entry was made the 29th of January 1741 , which was before the committing of this Fact . Then Redding , the Father of Joseph Redding is call 'd , and he says , the Fishery belongs to Sir John Dalben , who is Lord of the Manour ; that he let the Ground called Hare Mead to Sanders ; and that the same is now in the Possession of Sylvester . That he himself was in Chantry Mead , ( which is next to the Hare Mead ) , when this Accident happened : That when he came up to them , his Son said , he was afraid the Man was kill 'd , and asked Annesley how he came to do it , to which Annesley answered , he did not think of the Gun 's going off ; he says , they seemed very much troubled and concerned ; being asked the Position of the Gun when it went off , he says , Mr Annesley held the Gun in one Hand , and that it hung down by his Side . The next Witness , Gentlemen , is William Duffell ; and he says , that some Hours after the Accident happened , John Egglestone came into his House ; and the Man that brought him to his House , desired him to speak the Truth ; and the Account the Boy gave at that Time was , that Redding came up to his Father , and demanded the Net , and that his Father said he should not have it , and threw it into the River ; that then Mr Annesley came up , and the Gun went off , and his Father was shot . He says that Abraham Egglestone particularly asked the Boy whether he saw Mr Annesley pull the Trigger of the Gun , and that he said he could not tell ; that then he asked him if there were any Words between them , and he said , no ; that then this Witness said , it was a strange Thing that Mr Annesley should shoot his Father , and have no Words with him : That being asked in what Manner the Gun was held , Egglestone , with a Stick which he had in his Hand , showed them in what Manner Mr Annesley held the Gun : He says the Stick was in his Hand , hanging down by his Side . He says that Egglestone then was asked , if he thought Annesley did it wilfully , and that he said he could not tell . Being asked as to the Boy 's Character ; he says he has but an indifferent Character ; that he can not speak in the Praise of him , and has heard his Father often complain of him . The next Evidence is John Dalton ; and he says , that the next Day after the Accident , he went to Laleham , and there Egglestone told him , he believed it was an Accident , and not done designodly . He says the Boy has but an indifferent Character , but believes he would not forswear himself . The next Witness is Richard Chester , and he says , that he asked the Boy at Laleham , whether it was accidental or wilful ; and that he said he believed it was an Accident ; for he did not believe any Gentleman in cool Blood would designedly shoot another ; he says he had a Whip in his Hand , and desired Egglestone to show him how Mr Annesley held the Gun ; that he took the Whip in his Hand and showed him : That he held it in his Hand , hanging down by his Side ; and he says he saw Egglestone speak to Mr Annesley ; that he shook Hands with him , and drank a Glass of Wine , and said he did not think he did it designedly . Mr Paterson was then called , to prove what the Boy said before the Coroner ; but his Examination being taken down in writing , I did not think proper to allow of Parole Evidence . Then Mr King the Coroner was called ; and he produced the Minutes of the Depositions , taken the 4th of May at Laleham , before the Inquest . The Minutes have been read , by which it appears that Egglestone deposed , that as his Father and he were fishing in Sylvester 's Ground , Redding came up , and laid hold of his Father and demanded his Net , which his Father refused ; that then Annesley came up and said , Damn your Blood surrender your Net , or you are a dead Man ; that he held up his Piece against his Shoulder , and shot him directly : And his Father said , You Rogue , you have shot me , I am a dead Man . And , Gentlemen , his Deposition before the Coroner likewise says , that when he saw his Father was shot , he took his Knife , and cut the String of the Net ; and that then Mr Annesley went to strike him on the Head , with the butt End of the Gun . And he swears in his Deposition , that he was not offered any Money by any Body . Then they produced Mr Eesebins Williams , and he says , John Fisher told him , that John Egglestone had said he did not believe Mr Annesley killed his Father wilfully , but that it was done by Accident . Then James Betbune is produced , and he says he saw the Body ; that he examined and probed the Wound ; and he says it was an Inch and an half below the Ridge of the Hip-Bone , and an Inch and and half wide ; and that when he put his Instrument downwards , it would not go in ; but it would go in when the Probe was put upwards , or cross the Belly . The next Witness is John Perkins ; he says he opened the Body the 4th of May , to be inspected by the Coroner 's Inquest ; and there was a Wound an Inch and an half Diameter . He put in his Probe seven or eight Inches , and found the Wound a little horizontal , about an Inch and an half below the Hip-Bone ; he says there were Blisters on the other Side of the Body , and they were four or five Inches higher than the Wound . Mr King says , that Mr Giffard , who is the Sollicitor in this Prosecution , made Application to him to commit Mr Annesley to Newgate ; but he thought that was too severe , as Sir Thomas Reynell was a Justice of the Peace , and had taken sufficient Care of him . Paul Keating says , he became acquainted with Egglestone at the White Horse in Pickadilly , which is kept by one Williams ; and that he , at Egglestone 's Desire , drew a Note of 200 l. for him , and that the Boy , Egglestone , took a Copy of it . Gentlemen , this is the Evidence given in Behalf of the Prisoners ; and there has been Evidence given , to support the Character of John Egglestone . John Gardner , he says he has known him seven or eight Years , - that he is like other Boys , sometimes good , and sometimes indifferent , but he does not think he would forswear himself . Sylvester was called again , to Egglestone 's Character ; he says he has known him about three Years , that he was sometimes given to play , but believes he would not forswear himself . William Palmer says he has known him from a Child , and does not think he would forswear himself . Patrick Lawler says , he has known Paul Keating since the 18th of March ; that because he could not be supplied with Cloaths , as he expected , he was to swear , that the Earl of - was to give a Note to young Egglestone . This is the State of the Evidence on both Sides . Now Gentlemen , you are to consider , whether the Fact is Murder , Manslaughter , or Chance-Medley : Murder , Gentlemen , in Point of Law , is , when a Person kills another with express Malice and Design , or with implied Malice , as when it is without any offence or Provocation , but if there is a sudden Fray , and in that Fray and heat of Blood , a Person is killed , that is Manslaughter ; now there are several Things in the Course of the Evidence proper to come under your Consideration ; you will observe that Egglestone swears Mr Annesley said , Damn your Blood deliver your Net , or you are a dead Man , and that immediately the Gun went off , and the Man was shot ; if he let the Gun off designedly , if this was the Case , though on a sudden , he can be guilty of no less than Manslaughter ; but then you will consider what different Things the Boy has said ; he has declared several Times , he did not believe he did it designedly , and according to what the Surgeons say , it is not probable to me , that this Would could be given in the Situation he says Mr Annesley was in ; for the Wound goes upwards , and if he held his Gun as the Boy has said , the Wound could not have been as it is : Besides , that he is expressly contradicted in the Fact itself by old Redding , who swears he saw the Gun go off , and that it was hanging by Mr Annesley 's Side . Gentlemen , as I said before , the Question you are to consider of , is , whether this is Manslaughter , or Chance-Medley in Mr Annesley ; for as to Redding , he must certainly be acquitted ; and as to Murder , I can not think there is any Evidence to make Mr Annesley guilty of that ; but as there was some hot Blood there may be Reason to consider , whether it is not Manslaughter ; on the other Hand , if Mr Annesley was carrying his Gun by his Side , and it went off accidentally , then it will be Chance-Medley . [ Then the Jury having considered of their Virdicts , without going out of Court . ] Clerk of the Arraigns , Gentlemen of the Jury , are you agreed in your Verdicts ? Jury . Yes . Clerk of the Arraigns . Who shall say for you ? Jury . Our Foreman . Clerk of the Arraigns .

Clerk of the Arraigns . Gentlemen of the Jury , hearken to your Verdicts , as the Court has recorded them . You say that James Annesley is not guilty of the Felony and Murder whereof he stands indicted , but is guilty of Chance-Medley . You say that Joseph Redding is not guilty of the same Felony and Murder whereof he stands indicted , but is guilty of Chance-Medley . You say the same upon the Coroner 's Inquisition .
