Witness my Hand , Octob . 1 . 1730. JOHN FREEMAN . Note , The said John Freeman is removed at , or near Chyrurgeon 's Hall , Silver street . N. B . The aforesaid JOHN MOORE , has lately prepared two Anti-scorbutick Medicines , being Pills and a Spirit , which excel any Thing yet offer 'd to the Publick , with a Purge given at proper Times with it : It expels the numerous Trains of scorbutick Symptoms ; and as the Hypochondriac and Hysteric Illnesses have their Source from the Scurvy , it relieves them ; it alters and changes all the Juices in the Human Body ; thins the Lentor , viz . that fizy , viscid , coagulated Part of the Blood , which obstructs the Capillary Vessels , and is the Cause of Chilness in the extream Parts , as well as Heat in Hypochondriac and Hysteric Paroxysms , renovates the Blood , restores decay 'd Nature , chears the Heart , revives the Spirits , and opens Obstructions of the Viscera ; gives Rest to weary , tired , and worn-out Bodies ; it invigorates and inkindles again the almost extinguished , natural innate Heat , making the vital Flame to burn clear , removing Weaknesses and Indispositions , and restoring the pristine Health . The Symptoms are , cutaneous Eruptions , as red , yellow , or black Spots upon the Arms and Legs , as small as Flea-bites , sometimes as large as a Crown-piece , and sometimes the Limbs are beset with rough , scaly Swellings ; oftentimes there is an itching of the Skin , which is frequently taken for what is vulgarly call 'd the Itch . The Scurvy perverts the Lympha , and is a mortal Enemy to the nervous System , for Scorbutick Persons are troubled with Weariness , Sense of Weight , and a dull obscure Pain in the Limbs , the Appetite is either too stimulating or languid , the Gums are liable to Excrescence , Swellings and Ulcers , and when robb 'd void either a saltish Bloo d , or serous Humour ; the Teeth are loose and corroded , the Mouth has a Stench ; the Spittle is very salt and sometimes acid ; they are likewise affected with nocturnal Sweats , difficulty of Breathing , wandering Pains , a fat Skin is found sometimes swimming on the Top of the Urine ; but all these Symptoms are rarely found in the same Person .
