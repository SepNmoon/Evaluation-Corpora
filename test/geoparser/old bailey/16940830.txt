The Prisoner had Liberty to make his Exceptions against the Jury , after which these gentlemen were sworn to try the Issue , & c. Francis Merrick , Esq ; William Underhill Esq ; Edmund Salter , Jonas Morley , Thomas Cleeve , John Preston , Thomas Philips , Spencer Iles , Samuel Freebody , William Reeve , Richard Richmond , Edward Townsend , Gent . Then the Jury were counted , and the Clerk read the Indictment as followeth : Edward Reppington . Hold up thy Hand . [ Which he did . ] Gentlemen : You that are sworn , look upon the Prisoner , and hearken to his Charge . He stands Indicted by the Name of Edward Reppington , late of the Parish of St. James , Westminster , Esq ; For that He , not having the Fear of God before his Eyes , but being instigated and seduced by the Devil , on the 27th day of July last past , with Force and arms , and of Malice before-thought , in and upon John Dodd , Esq ; in the Peace of God , and of our Soveraign Lord and Lady the King and Queen , he did make an assault with a certain and Rapier made of Iron and Steel , value 5s . which he had in his right hand held and drawn , in and upon the Breast near the left Arm-hole of him the said John Dodd , he did strike and thrust in , giving him the said John Dodd , near to his left Arm-hole as aforesaid , one mortal Wound of the breadth of half an Inch , and of the depth of 6 Inches , of which he then and there instantly died ; so that he the said Edward Reppington in manner and form aforesaid , did kill and murther him the said John Dodd against the Peace of our said Soveraign Lord and Lady the King and Queen , Their Crown and Dignity , and against the form of the Statute in that case made and provided . Upon that Indictment he hath been arraigned , and thereupon hath pleaded Not guilty ; And for his Tryal hath put himself upon God and his Countrey , which Countrey you are . Your Charge is to enquire whether he be guilty of this Felony and Murther , whereof he stands indicted , or not guilty ; If you find that he is guilty ; you are to enquire what Goods and Chatels , Lands or Tenements he had at the time of the Felony and Murther committed , or at any time since . If you find him not guilty , you are to enquire whether he fled for it . If you find that he be fled for it , you are to enquire of his Goods and Chatels as if you found him guilty . If you find him not guilty , nor that he did fly for it , you are to say so , and no more , and hear your Evidence . Then the King 's Council opened the Nature of the Fact as said in the Indictment , to the Gentlemen of the Jury , and told them what a barbarous Fact the Gentleman at the Bar had committed , how malicious it was in all parts of it ; not at all making any severe Reflections upon the Prisoner . Then the Witnesses were called and sworn ; the chiefest of which were these Three , viz . John Goodchild , the Inn keeper , at the White-Horse in the Hay-Market , where the Fact was done ; Mr. Dodd 's Footman , and his Groom , who were all sworn , and were Eye-witnesses to the matter ; besides several other Evidence by way of confirmation . But first let us begin with the occasion of this Misfortune ; You must note , the Prisoner and the Deceased were of kin , and not only so , but very conversant together ; Mr. Dodd had a Horse to sell , that the Prisoner had a mind to , so Mr. Dodd gave him leave to ride him ; and if he liked the Horse , the price was to be 20 Guineas ; having given the Groom a Guinea in earnest for the Horse . When he had so tried the Horse he complained to Mr. Dodd that the Horse stumbled ; why , says Mr. Dodd , If it be so , Cousin Reppington , and you do n't like him , I 'll take him again ; No , says the Prisoner , it may be the fault may be in the shoeing of him ; I 'll take him to my Farrier , and he shall look upon his Feet ; Nay , repl 'd Mr. Dodd , I wont agree to that ; if you will be off of the Horse , let it be this Evening , or else tomorrow I shall expect you shall stand fast to the Bargain ; to which Mr. Reppington seemed to yield ; but after this he comes to the Groom , Mr. Dodd not being at home , and told him that the Horse , was not for his turn , and refused to pay Mr. Dodd for the Horse , upon which Mr. Dodd arrested him for the 20 Guineas , this relished so ill with the Prisoner , that he grew very angry , came to the Groom again at Mr Dodds House on the Friday before the Fact was done , and bid him tell his Master , That he was injured , and would have satisfaction , and that the Point of the Sword should decide the matter ; and that he should be glad to meet him behind Montague House ; and that he wore a Sword as well as he , & c. And then on the 27th of July last , the day that this unhappy Accident fell out , he came to the White Horse Inn in the Haymarket again , and there he was much indisposed , and lookt angry ; and Mr. Dodd 's Footman standing in the Inn Gate-way , waiting for his Master 's calling him to go abroad , as also the Groom ; Mr. Dodd immediately approached near them , and coming up towards Mr. Reppington , he very kindly saluted him with a How do you Cousin Reppington , I am your most humble Servant , putting his Hat off very low , with all the loving Respects imaginable ; but Mr. Reppington made but little return of his Courtesie , only just mov 'd his Hat , shewing a stern Countenance ; thereupon Mr. Dodd came to him very mildly , took him by the Button in a friendly manner , desiring that the Quarrel might be friendly accommodated ; Mr. Reppington replied , No , nothing but the point of the Sword shall decide the Controversie ; immediately throwing off his Hat and Perriwig , giving a little back , and drew his Sword , with that Mr. Dodd drew his , and to't they went ; Mr. Reppington making the first pass at Mr Dodd , which he put by , then Mr. Reppington came at him again , and he defending himself , Mr Reppington laid hold of his Sword with his hand , held it by , and so run him into the left Armhole in the mean time ; Mr. Goodchild , and the Footboy and Groom , went to get a Dung-fork at the Stables , or elsewhere , or some such Instrument , to part them , and to beat down their Swords , but before they could come back , Mr. Dodd had received his mortal wound , and was dropt down dead the blood issuing out at his mouth ; upon which Mr. Reppington immediately surrender 'd himself to them , not offering to make the least flight , was carried before a Justice of Peace , and committed for the Fact , and was found guilty of murther upon the Coroner 's Inquest . This was positively sworn by the groom and Footman , and by Mr. Goodchild . The Prisoner cross-examined the witness against him , and did all that in him lay to evade the proof ; and called a poor Woman , who , he alledged , saw the whole matter ; She declared , that she was accidentally going that way , and being weary , sat down upon the Bench at the Inn-Gate to rest her self , and turning her head into the Inn , she saw the Ingagement , and that Mr. Dodd gave the first Pass at Mr. Reppington , and drew his Sword first ; But this was contradicted by Mr. Godchild , and the Footman and Groom ; who further deposed , that they saw no such Woman there , and were very confident that there was no Woman at all there at that Juncture of time ; The Prisoner , after he had been very much indulged , and very patiently heard by the Court , made his defence , declaring that the Deceased was his beloved Friend , and that he had no malice propense against him , Lamenting the loss , of so precious a Friend ; then he called abundance of Witnesses , and those Persons of no mean Quality , to give a testimony of him , in the general , as to his Conversation heretofore , who all agreed in their declaration concerning him ; how that he was a person of a very quiet , composed behaviour , and that they never saw any thing come from him , but what was like a Gentleman ; and if he had at any time injured any person , he always begged their pardon , and made ample satisfaction . That they never found him to be quarrelsome . He pleaded very strenuously for himself , took up a great deal of time ( viz . ) the space of 6 or 7 hours ; the Court very patiently hearing him all that he had to say . Then the Court summ 'd up the Evidence on both sides to the Gentlemen of the Jury very distinctly , with all tenderness on behalf of the Prisoner , and told them ( first ) that it was certain that Mr. Dodd was kill 'd by Mr. Reppington : But then the question was , what it would amount to in point of Law ? Whether to Murther or Manslaughter , according to Evidence that had been given against Mr. Reppington ? And that the Court were of the opinion , That if Mr. Reppington out of any precedent disgust or malice that he had against Mr. Dodd , did design to fight him , and in pursuance thereof draw 'd his Sword with which he kill 'd him , it was murther . But however , they were to be Judges of the Fact ; So that if so be that they found that the Prisoner was guilty of the murther of Mr. Dodd , they would find a Verdict accordingly ; but if not satisfied in their Consciences , that he did do it with any disgust or premeditated malice , then they should acquit him of the murther , and find him guilty only of Manslaughter . Then the Gentlemen of the Jury having considered of the matter for about two hours time , they returned this Verdict , That Mr. Reppington was guilty of wilful Murther upon this Indictment , as also upon the Coroner 's Inquest . Then the Prisoner was remanded to Newgate . [ Death . See summary . ] The Tryals being over , the Court proceeded to give Sentence , as followeth . Burnt in the Hand 15 .
