The Proceedings at all the Sessions in the Old-Bayly for Eighteen months last past . THough this Collection was intended only for one year past before this present Aug. 1677 , and thence ( if encouraged by General Acceptance ) to be annually continued , yet we shall reflect a little further , and begin with . An account of the sessions before Easter-Term 1676 , beginning April the 5th . There were then no fewer than Fifteen men and One woman Convicted ( per Patriam ) upon fair Tryals for their respective Crimes , who received sentence of Death ; of whom Eight of the least notorious , by mercy of Authority , upon consideration of Circumstances , mediation of Friends , and solemn Engagements of future Amendment , obtained the gracious favour of Reprieves : the other Eight were executed April the 19th , their Names and Crimes as follows : Michael Jones and Charles Potter , for a Burglary and Robbery in Dukes-place , taking away several bags of Money , Plate , Cloaths , & c. Jones at Tyburn made a very penitent Speech , declaring how Idleness , Disobedience to his Parents , Ill Company , and lewd Women , first brought him into bad Courses , and consequently to this untimely Death . John Maxfield , for robbing a Brick-maker in Frog-lane , whom he and his Crew barbarously stript naked . He was about a fortnight afterwards taken by the Watch , ( or rather by their Dogs , for had it not been for them he had escaped ) being , 't is probable , going again on the like Designe . Robert Scott for Felony and Burglary : He had been indicted and acquitted one Sessions , convicted and burnt in the hand next Sessions , condemned and repriev 'd last Sessions , and now , though a Prisoner , found to contrive and abet Rogueries abroad , and thereupon hang 'd out of the way . Elizabeth Longman , an old and impudent Offender , having been above Twelve times in Newgate , she had been lately transported ; but returning , stole a great quantity of Silks ; for which she was Convicted last Sessions , and employ 'd Edward Wall and Edward Russel to engage a Gentleman of Quality to solicite a Reprieve for one of her Companions . In this Gentleman 's Lodgings they observ 'd abundance of Plate , and speaking of it , this Bess Longman cries , And did you onely see it ? you dull Fools , go take it into possession : Which , at her instigation they effected ; but being young Thieves , were soon discovered ; pleaded guilty to the Indictment , and now suffer 'd with her . At a Sessions the 28th of June 1676 . Three men and Two women received sentence of Death , but onely Four suffered , viz . Alexander After and Thomas Fowler , for Robbery on the Highway , being Rogues of the Foot-pad that used to pillage Market-women , & c. Richard Hazlegrove for having Two Wives : Upon his Conviction he prayed the benefit of his Clergy , which was granted ; but not being able to read , was Condemned and Executed : A Case that seems a little severe ; but so the Law directs : which may admonish Parents to bestow , and Children to study at least to read well , since sometimes a man loses his life meerly for want of it . The fourth was famous Frances Watson , otherwise called Mrs. Riggs the younger . Thieving had been her Trade from her infancy ; her Mother often Condemn 'd , and then under Transportation ; one or two of her Brothers , and several pretended Husbands or Gallants hang 'd ; to which she brought her self now by her own simplicity : For , lying for Transportation , she sent for several people she had robb 'd to get money of them , under pretence of helping them to their Goods again ; not doubting but she was safe now from being indicted for them : but therein her Newgate-Counsel fail 'd her ; for her pardon extended onely to remit the Crime for which she was convicted : So that she was now arraigned afresh , and found guilty upon her own Confession , and so followed the fate of her Family . At the Sessions Aug. 23 , & c. 1676 . Sixteen Condemn 'd , onely Eight suffered , viz . Tho . Moore , and James Parker Convicted of a Felony , which appeared to the Court to be a Burglary at Cue in Surry ; and so excluding benefit of Clergy , one of them refusing to plead till he was put into the Press , and so bruised , that without further Execution , 't is thought he would not have surviv 'd . John Smith , George Marshall , and John Darkin , for Robbing the Parish-Church of St. Giles in the Fields , and stealing several pieces of Plate , Communion . Chalices , & c. which they performed by the help of and Engine of Villany , called a Betty , of incredible force for forcing open Doors , Locks , Bolts , & c. this was made by Darkin , an extraordinary Artist at such black works . These Prisoners did aver in Newgate , that when they were got into the Vestry and breaking open the Chests , a Spectrum or Apparition did visibly stand before them ; but so resolved they were on their wicked Designe , that even the Devil himself could not scare them from it . Anthony Tailor for a Felony and Burglary , and Elizabeth Simmonds , for murdering her Bastard-childe , which she threw into a Pond . Richard Cook , Matthew Walkenden , and Martha Harman , for several Burglaries . The later was a matchless young piece of Confidence , who broke open a house at Islington ; a Crime rarely attempted by that Sex : she had four times before been tryed for several Offences , but now could not obtain further indulgence . The last was John Evans , a lad not above Fifteen years of age , but old in Roguery : He had several Indictments for Felonies against him , and had been both whipt and burnt in the hand before . At the Sessions 11th of October 1676 . Sixteen in all received sentence of Death , but onely Five Executed . The most remarkable business was the Tryal of Henry Graves for murdering one William Parker a Ditcher at Islington . The Prisoner and his Brother ( not then taken ) fell upon him without cause , swore they would beat out his brains , and with a stake did at last kill him ; yet the Jury , for I know not what reasons , found it only Manslaughter : but Providence not suffering Murder so to escape , when he came to his Book , though a pretty good Scholar , and well tutor 'd before , yet he could not read a word , and thereupon was deservedly hang 'd . There were Two Condemned , a woman of above Forty years of age for murdering her Bastard-childe , who was Executed , and a man for Personating another man as Bail before a Judge , who at the Gallows received a gracious Reprieve . At this time was that blasphemous Impostor Lodowick Muggleton tryed , and sentenced to stand three days in the Pillory , his Books to be burnt before his face , to pay Five hundred pounds fine , and give Bail ( not of his own Party or Gang ) for his good behaviour . At the Sessions 7th of March 1676/7 . Was Tryed and Executed the renounced Thomas Sadler , and William Johnson , for a Burglary in the house of the Lord High Chancellor of England , and stealing the Mace and two Purses . Sadler as he had lived impudently , so he died pitifully , and with little generosity of Spirit ; but Johnson , with a becoming resolution and staid temper that at once shew 'd his sense of his-sins , and faith in his Saviour , made a very repentant and pithy-Discourse at the place of Execution , endeavouring to warn all others by his Example , & c. At the same time there suffered Francis Webb , Matthew Gammond , and Anthony Richoake , for several Burglaries : There being in all Fifteen Condemned , the rest obtained Reprieves . The Sessions 25th of April 1677 . Was famous for the Tryal , Condemnation , and Execution of Robert , William , and Margaret Dine , two own brothers and a sister , for disfiguring , and in a barbarous manner mangling the Nose and Face of one Jane King , contrary to the late Act of Parliament in that behalf . They all absolutely persisted to deny the doing this cruel fact , and asserted their innocency to the last gasp , and died very much pitied by many people that knew them . At the same time suffered one Margaret Spicer for murdering her Bastard-childe : As also David Hackley , Jeremiah Dawson and Mary Brown , all notorious Offenders , and formerly burnt in the hand , now convicted of several Felonies . The Sessions the first of June 1677 . There were then Condemned Mr. Nicholas Throckmorton , for robbing two Ministers on the road three miles on this side Uxbridge ; taken by the most commendable courage of one of the Ministers men , who alone fought with the Prisoner and his Companion for above half an hour ; and at last with the help of his Master , moved ( though without a Weapon ) by his servant 's brave defence , to assist him what he could , made one of the Thieves ride away , and took the other . He suffered very penitently on the 13th of June : At which time was likewise Executed William Dennis for murdering a poor Tub-man , who being in a furious passion against his Wife , and having beat herexceedingly , a Croud of people were gathered about ; where upon taking down an Halt-pike , he swore he would kill some of them ; and accordingly dispatcht this harmless man , sitting on his Water-tubs , without the least provocation . Which may teach all men to moderate their possions , and not let them run unbridled to mischief , left thereby they bring themselves to some such shameful End . The last Sessions in July 1677 . Was sufficiently crouded to hear the Tryal of that Monster rather than woman , Mary Hicks , who suffer 'd her self to be Buggered by a Mungril . This detestable Villany was sufficiently proved by Three witnesses ; and for the same , the vil wretch was executed on the 18th of July , the Dog being carried along with her in the Cart , and hang 'd upon a Tree neer the Gallows before her face . One of the Evidence being great with Childe , there has been a scandalous Report spread abroad , that the same day this woman suffer 'd , she should fall in Labour , and not being able to be delivered , confess that she had herein forsworn her self out of malice ; which Report ; and others to the same effect , are utterly false and groundless ; the said Witness continuing in perfect health , and well satisfi 'd in the integrity of her Testimony . Charles Godfry and Rogers Withers for a like Crime committed in Hartfordshire ; but being taken in Middlesex with some of the Goods about them , were tryable here . The other four were John Seabrook , William Minors , Arthur Minors , and Richard Shaw , for several Burglaries and Felonies . The same day suffered John Gimbold and Mary Russel , both old incorngible Offenders , and now Condemned for several Felonies .
