He pretended to be so forgetful as to know or remember nothing at all of the Matter , and to be intirely ignorant of every particular Circumstance ; may , was sure he never carried such a Gentleman .

Upon which the Court wondered at his forgetfulness of so many remarkable Passages deposed by his Master , mistress , and a Fellow-Servant , bid him recollect himself ; but still he would remember nothing .

The other Evidences that saw the Coach , when it came to Star-Court , deposed , they did believe him to be the Coachman , and describ 'd his Clothes , which agreed to the Description ; but still he obstinately denying it , Mary Roberts the Prisoner , that was carried in the Coach with Mr.Montens try 'd out , that is the Coachman that carried us ; he is the very Man , and had 3s for carrying us .

He then asked the Clerk if there was a Grave ready for it , he answered him there was one almost ready ; he enquired if the had gone for it , and was answered No . he then enquired of the Prisoner who the Person to be buried was ; he answered Wife that came to her House the last night , and was taken with a very violent Fit , and continued in it till she died . He said that was a little odd . He asked her if she had acquianted the Church-warden or Overseen of the Poor with it , The answered she had : he asked her if she was sure of it , the fact she had acquainted them with it ; he asked when , she replied about 2 or 3 Hours ago : he asked her again if she was she had , she then snapped at him , saying , do n't I tell you so ? That then he answered her it was false , for he had been for 4 Hours at the Church-warden 's House , was at Dinner there , and the Overseen was at Dinner with him there , and if so he should have heard of it .

James Scot , the Clerk deposed , That on the 30th of December , about 3 Hours before the Corps came , a Woman came from Tumble down Dick 's at Brentford , and order 'd him to make a Grave for a Woman , who was a Pensioner 's Wife who had died at her Mistress 's , he asked her why she did not send to have the Bell ring , the Woman answered she did not know ; that he made the Grave and the Corps was brought , and that Mr. Tiller talking with him about it , he said he was in a strange hurry of Mind , and am taken with a Trembling and so strange , I ca n't tell what is the atter with me , I wish this Woman is not murdered , I will have the Coffin opened before I bury her ; That when the Minister would have the Coffin opened she told him the Deceased had the Plague and flunk , and was so nasty that it was not fit to be seen .

Mrs. Banister confirmed what the other Evidences had said ; and deposed it was her Opinion , that the Deceased had been cut , for that no Woman ever received so much Damage , or could , by the Birth of a Child ; and that the Child had no Nose only Nostrils , and was as flat as the back of the Hand . Mrs. Levings , another Midwife , also confirmed what the other Evidences had said ; and added , she did belived the Woman was ded dry , because she never purged in the Coffin first nor last . Jane Round deposed , that she having viewed the Body , and being of opinion that she had been barbarously used , went to Mary Ipsley , and desired her to declare the whole matter , and who had been guilty of that Barbarity , and not to go to save others and hang her self ; for I told her I did believe somebody deserved to be hang 'd . That she made answer , she knew nothing of the matter ; that there being a Woman setting at some distance from her , whom she called Nurse , she said what was done she did . The Woman made answer , Ay , Landlady , but you said I should come to no Trouble . That Mary Ipsley replied , Ay , Girl , so I did ; no more shall you .

Mary Ipsley pleaded in her defence , that the Deceased came to her House on the Monday before Christmas-day in a very poor Condition , and desired she might lodge there that Night , but she refused to let her , till by the Persuasion of some Men who were drinking there she did ; that the Deceased said she would go to London early the next Morning ; that about 9 a Clock the next Morning she sent to call her , but no answer was made and wondering at it , they went up to see , and found her in a Fit ; that she got Geneva and robbed her Temples , got Sack and Black Cherry Water , and her Teeth being set they could not get it down her Throat ; that some time after she seemed to be a little recovered by lying still , but soom after she fell into another Fit , and so continued all Day on Wednesday , on Thursday she fell into her Fits again , and continued in and out of them all Thursday , and so Friday and Saturday ; and she never heard her speak from the Night she came till she died ; and on Sunday Morning a Woman that came with her from Windsor , and tended her as a Nurse , went up Stairs to see how she did , and came down in a Fright and said she was in Labour ; they went up immediately , and both she and the Child were Dead , the Child being born dead . She also called Persons who endeavoured to invalidate the Evidence of Elizabeth Stephens , by giving her the Character of a loose Person , and called the Overseen to like she had told him of a Person that was taken ill in her House of Convulsion Fits ; and that she did apply her self to him for a Coffin for her ; she called also a Midwife and Surgeon , who endeavoured to account for the extraordinary Dilaorration , supposing it not to be cut , but that it might be possible to be torn by the strength of the Convulsions ( though this was strenously opposed in Court , and with strong Reasons , ) and that the Child had been dead three Days before the Birth .
