 Mr. Russel . We stopt there , whilst Mr. Sutton sent for some body to come to him . L. C. J . You said just now that Mr. Sutton sent for Mr. Harrison . Mr. Russel . No , my Lord , I do not remember that , but Mr. Sutton said Harry , or Harrison , where art thou going , when he went by us . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , this Man is a stranger to me . Call John Allen , Drawer at the King's-Head Tavern . [ Who appeared . Mr. Harrison . John Allen , what time of Night was it that Mr. Sutton and Mr. Russel came to your House in a Coach ? J. Allen . I believe it was about Eleven a Clock . L. C. J . How much Wine had they ? J. Allen . Two Half Pints of Canary . L. C. J . What Night was it ? what Day of the Month was it ? J. Allen . My Lord , I ca n't remember what Day of the Month , but it was that Night that Doctor Clench was murther 'd . L. C. J . Did you see Mr. Harrison there ? J. Allen . I ca n't tell that , I never saw him , 'till I saw him in Prison . Mr. Harrison . Did not you go to Mr. Maccaffee 's House ? J. Allen . Yes , I did . Mr. Harrison . Did not one strike you with a Muff ? J. Allen . Yes , but I ca n't remember who it was . Lord Mayor . Look upon that Man , do you not know him to be the Person ? J. Allen . No , my Lord , I do not know him to be the Person . Mr. Darnell . Who sent you to Crown-Court ? J. Allen . Mr. Russel . Mr. Darnell . For what ? J. Allen . For a Servant Maid , and he bid me tell her that he had a desire to speak with her . Mr. Darnell . How long did you tarry at the House ? J. Allen . I did not stay at all . Mr. Harrison . Call Mr. Carden , Drawer at the King's-Head Tavern . [ Who appeared . Mr. Harrison . What time did Mr. Sutton come to your House , did you see any one stand at the Coach side ? and what Cloaths had he on ? Carden . I saw one stand at the Coach side , and he had a Hanging-Coat or a Cloak on , it was about the Hour of Eleven , to the best of my knowledge , and I saw a Man go into the Coach , and come out again . Mr. Coroner . What time of Night do you shut your Doors , especially on Monday Nights ; and were they shut when Mr. Sutton called in the Coach ? Carden . We shut them commonly about Eleven a Clock at Night , but on Monday Nights usually later ; they were shut when Mr. Sutton called , and I opened them for him . L. C. J . Can you say that the Prisoner was the Man that drank with Mr. Sutton ? Carden . To the best of my knowledge ( looking on the Prisoner ) that is the Man , I ca n't be positive , my Lord . L. C. J . Well , have you any more Witnesses ? Mr. Harrison . No , my Lord , unless Mr. Essington be here , he promised to be here to give an account of me . My Lord , there is a Gentleman thatis in the Press-Yard , one Mr. Butler , I desire he may be sent for , if your Lordship please . L. C. J . Let him be fetch 'd down . [ Which was done . L. C. J . But , in the mean time , it behoves you to give account of these things . First , why did you say that you were a Parliament Man ? Secondly ; why did you leave your Lodgings , and take other Lodgings in Paul's-Church-Yard ? Thirdly , why did you say that you had extraordinary business ? Give some account what your business was , and who that Gentleman was , that staid for you in the Street , when Mr. Humstone desired you to stay and Sup with him , what hinder 'd you from accepting his Invitation ? Now we would have you to Consider of these things , and give an answer to them , for it much concerns you so to do . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , first as to the first , I do declare that I never went for a Parliament Man , nor never said so : Secondly , that Night I was to go out of Town , I had left word at several Coffee-Houses that I was going out of Town upon earnest Business , and with above twenty People besides , that I was going out of Town , and I was about to go to Basing-Stoke , to a Gentleman that owed me Money , one Mr. Bulling , but I could not get money to go . L. C. J . Prove that you were to go into the Country . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , I ca n't prove that now , except I could have sent to Basing-Stoke . L. C. J . That you should have done before now ; why did you not stay with Mr. Humston , when he Invited you to Sup with him ? You might have been better entertained there , than by going among strangers to Play at Cards for a Penny a Corner , at an Ale-house . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , I was unwilling to stay , because he had Strangers with him . L. C. J . What if he had , you are not such a bashful man , that you could not Sup with Strangers . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , Mr. Rowe was accused with me . L. C. J . What if he was ? he was under some Suspicion , and he hath made it appear where he was at the time the Fact was Committed , and now he is Discharged . Then Mr. Butler was brought into Court from Newgate , attended by a Keeper . Mr. Harrison . Mr. Butler , Pray tell the Court what Mr. Fairbeard said to you about me ? Mr. Butler . My Lord , Mr. Fairbeard asked me what I could say about what Mr. Harrison had said to me concerning the Murther of Doctor Clench ? I told him I could not tell what to make of his broken and rambling Speeches and Discourses , they being most of them spoken when he was in his Drink . This is all that I know , my Lord . L. C. J . This is not a Witness for your turn . Mr. Darnell . Call Mrs. Anwell . [ Who was sent for from her Lodgings in Brownlow-Street in Holborn , and appeared , and was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Madam , pray give an account what Mrs. Ashbolt told you concerning any Man 's being in a Coach at Brownlow-street end ? Mrs. Anwell . I know nothing of my own Knowledge , but the Night that Doctor Clench was Murthered , I sent Mrs. Ashbolt of an Errand , and at her return , I blam 'd her for staying so long ; and she told me , that as she was returning home , a Coach stop 'd at Brownlow-Street end , with two Men withCloaks on in it , and that one of them had the Coachman go for Doctor Clench , and desire him to come to them , and in his going several times look 'd back as if he suspected the men would leave the Coach , and so she stayed until Doctor Clench came and went into the Coach , and that one of the men gave the Doctor his Place ; and that one of them had a Fair Perriwig and a Sanguine Complexion . Mr. Darnell . What discourse had you with her when you heard that those men had Murdered Doctor Clench ? Mrs. Anwell . She told me that one of those men had a Fair Perriwig and a Sanguin Complexion , and that one of them had a Cloak on . L. C. J . Did she say that she observed either of their Faces ? Mrs. Anwell . Yes , my Lord , she said that one of them had a round Face , and a big Voice . L. C. J . Did she say , she could know him again ? Mrs. Anwell . No , my Lord , she did not say so , but she said that she could know his Voice again . And after the last Sessions I told Mrs. Clench of it , and that if she would send for the Young Woman , she would inform her further of it . L. C. J. Madam , Pray what was the reason , that she did not Discover it sooner to Mrs. Clench ? Mrs. Anwell . Why truly because Mrs. Ashbolt , her Mother , was unwilling she should concern her self in such a Matter . Mr. Darnell . Call another Witness , Mr. Jones , Coachmaker . [ who was sworn . Mr. Harrison . Pray , my Lord , take notice , that now she says that those Gentlmen had Cloaks on , that came in the Coach to Brownlow-street end . L. C. J . Yes , we heard her what she said . Mr. Darnell . My Lord , I will ask this Witness , Mr. Jones , a Question . Mr. Darnell . Pray Sir , tell my Lord and the Jury , what Mrs. Ashbolt did at Newgate . Mr. Jones . My Lord , I went with her to Newgate , together with Doctor Clench his Coachman , and when she came to Newgate , before she saw Mr. Harrison ( only stood at the Chamber Door and hoard him speak ) she said , that , to the best of her thoughts , he was the man that put his Head out of the Coach to look after the Coachman , and Swore at him , for she knew his Voice . And when she came to see him , she said , that she knew his Face , and Declared that was the Man that put his Head out of the Coach . L. C. J . Did he look out of the Coach , Mrs. Ashbolt ? Mrs. Ashbolt . Yes , my Lord , he put his head out of the Coach , and look 'd after the Coach-man , to see if he went Right to Doctor Clench 's Door , and did swear at him , because he went no faster . L. C. J . How could you discern his Face ? Mrs. Ashbolt . By the Light of two Lamps , that were near , which did shine into the Coach . L. C. J . Can you take it upon your Oath that the Prisoner is the same Person ? Mrs. Ashbolt . Yes , my Lord , I can both by his Voice and Face . Mr. Darnell . Now , my Lord , we shall shew your Lordship somewhat in Relation to the Credit of those Witnesses , that the Prisoner hath brought here ; Particularly , as to Mr. Baker , we shall prove that he hath been Convicted for a Cheat . And as for Maccaffee , he keeps a very disorderly House , where ill People commonly resort . Mr. Darnell . Cryer , Call Mrs. Martha Whelstead , and Mr. Thomas Cole . L. C. J. Mrs. Jones , what time did Mr. Harrison come to your House , to his Lodging , that Night that the Murder was committed ? Mrs. Jones . I think it was about Eleven a Clock , or a little before Eleven . L. C. J . What time on the Monday did he hire the Lodging of you ? Mrs. Jones . It was sometime after Dinner . L. C. J . It was before Night , was it not ? Mrs. Jones . Yes , my Lord , it was before Night . Mr. Darnell . My Lord , I desire that Mr. Tanner may Read the Record against Mr. Baker , whereby it will appear that he was Indicted and Convicted at Hixes-hall , for Cheating the Parish of St. Giles in Middlesex , when he was Scavenger there , by altering the Figures in the Book , and Rateing the Sums of Money Higher upon divers of the Parishioners , than they were in the Parish Book , and then Collecting and extorting the Money , so by him increased , from them . Mr. Tanner Reads the Indictment aforesaid , by which it did appear to the Court , and to the Jury , that the said Mr. Baker was Indicted for the Offence aforesaid , and confessed the Indictment , and was fined for it twenty Shillings . Mr. Baker . My Lord , I was wrongfully Indicted , and Traversed the Indictment , and was acquitted . L. C. J. Mr. Tanner , give me the Record . Lord Chief Justice peruses the Record . Mr. Baker , I have Read the material parts of the Record , and do find that you were Indicted for that offence , and that you confessed the Indictment , and were fined for it . Mr. Baker . My Lord , I was acquitted of it , and can prove it by Captain Cannon , who knows me , and my Reputation , and he is in Court . L. C. J. Mr. Baker , the Record testifieth the Truth , and can not erre , therefore you have great Confidence to aver against it , yet I will hear what Captain Cannon faith . Mr. Baker . Call Captain Cannon . [ who appeared . L. C. J. Captain Cannon , do you know this Mr. Baker ? Captain Cannon . Yes , my Lord , very well . Mr. Darnell . My Lord , I desire that Captain Cannon may be sworn . L. C. J. Mr. Tanner , Swear Captain Cannon . [ who was sworn . L. C. J . Sir , do you know that Mr. Baker was Indicted for falsifying of the Scavengers Book when he was Scavenger , and Acquitted or Convicted , and what do you know about it ? Captain Cannon . My Lord , I am an Inhabitant of the Parish of St. Giles in the Fields , and so I was when Mr. Baker was Scavenger , and do well remember thas some of the Inhabitants of that Division whereof he was Scavenger , were troubled , and complained , that they were charged more than usually they had been to the Scavengers Rate ; and it was discover 'd that several Figures of the Book by which Mr. Baker Collected the Money to the Scavengers Rate , were blotted and altered , and did not agree with the Parish Leadger-Book , but the Sums in his Book so blotted and altered were raised ; whereupon it was ordered that he should be Indicted for it , and it was done accordingly , and he was Fined for it , and to the best of my Remembrance he confessed that Indictment . L. C. J. Captain Cannon , Pray tell the Court and the Jury , of what Reputation Mr. Baker is now . Captain Cannon . My Lord , he is now of none of the clearest Reputations . Captain James Partrich , of the same Parish , being in Court , offered himself , and gave the same Account of Mr. Baker that Captain Cannon did . Mr. Darnel . Crier , Call Mr. Francis Brampton , Mrs. Martha Whelstead , and Mr. Thomas Cole . [ And Mrs. Whelstead and Mr. Cole appeared , and were sworn . ] Mr. Darnel . Mrs. Whelstead , pray give the Court and Jury an Account what disorderly House Mr. Maccaffee keeps ? Mrs. Whelstead . My Lord , I dwell in Crown-Court in Chancery-Lane , over against Mr. Maccaffee 's House ; and he and she are very ill People ; and keep a very evil and scandalous House , and such as are reputed to be House-breakers , Pick-pockets , and Lewd-women , do use and frequent the House ; and there is commonly at late hours in the Night , Persons calling out Murder , and Whore and Rogue , and such sort of Language , disturbing their Neighbours ; and their House hath been several times searched by several Constables for stollen Goods , and for the Persons that have stolen them ; and upon such Searches , there have been stolen Goods found there : And I have seen great Lewdness there between Men and Women ; and the Neighbours do account it a House of an ill Fame , and do avoid going thither . Mr. Tho . Cole . My Lord , I do know Mr. Maccaffee and his Wife ; I do dwell over against his House , and they are reputed to keep an ill House , and most Persons that frequent it , are reputed to be Persons of lewd and evil Lives and Conversations ; and it is amongst the Neighbourhood noted for a scandalous House , and several Constables have several times searched there for stolen Goods . L. C. J . What have you more to say Mr. Harrison ? Mr. Harrison . I can not say any thing more ; you may deal with me according to my Deserts in this Matter . L. C. J . You may assure your self , that we will do you no wrong ; Have you any more to say ? [ He made no Reply . ] Mr. Darnel . My Lord , We have another Witness come now , who was not here before . Crier , Call Mr. Charles Whitfield . [ Who was sworn . ] Mr. Darnel . My Lord , This Gentleman can give your Lordship an Account what the Prisoner said of his being just come out of the Country , upon the fifth of January last . Pray tell my Lord what you know , Sir . Mr. Cha . Whitfield . My Lord , Upon the fifth day of January last , being the Day after Dr. Clench was murdered , I went to Joe 's Coffee-House in Salisbury-Court , and there Mr. Harrison sitting by the Fireside , says I to Mr. Harrison , Where have you been for a long time that I have not seen you ? Says he , I have been in the Country : Where says I ? Says he , about twenty Miles off , in Kent ; and I want a Landress , and a Lodging . Says I , do you hear the News , Sir ? What News , says he ? Why , said I , of Dr. Clench 's being murdered : I can not tell the Occasion , said I , but he was found dead in a Coach last Night in Leadenhall-street . Then says he , I did love him very well once , but of late he hath been a barbarous Rogue to a Gentlewoman , a Friend of mine , and she is in the Compter now : And Mr. Harrison said it was a just Judgment of God upon the Doctor for being so great a Villain to the Gentlewoman ; therefore I will write to herpresently , and give her an Account of his Death . And , my Lord , the Contents of his Letter were these , as near as I can remember . `` Madam , `` I Am just now going to Lambeth , but hearing of Dr. Clench 's `` Murder , I do hereby give you an Account of it , and can impute `` it to no less than a just Judgment of God upon him for his `` Baseness shewed to you . And if you think fit to send to Madam `` Clench , it may be she may send somewhat towards your Relief , she `` now being a Widow as well as you . Madam , I am yours to command , Henry Harrison . My Lord , after this came into the same Coffee-House another Person , one Mr. Ravenscroft , of whom Mr. Harrison asked some Question about Dr. Clench ; who reply 'd , That he heard that Dr. Clench was murdered , and that it was committed by a Bully of the Town that belonged to a Gentlewoman in the Compter who was laid in there upon Dr. Clench 's account ; at which , he was much startled : Says he again , There is no Person familiar with that Gentlewoman but my self ; for I know , and am concerned in all her Affairs : Perhaps then I may be taken up about it : Or , my Lord , he used Words to that effect . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , this Woman was not in the Compter upon Dr. Clench 's account . L. C. J . No , the Witness do n't say so ; but that it was the Discourse of the Town that she was , and the Town did suppose her so to be . What did he say further , Sir ? Mr. Whitfield . My Lord , he said that he had been in Kent about twenty Miles off ; and he said , that he wanted a Landress , because he had some foul Linnen to wash ; which he produced . This was on the Tuesday , and the Murder was committed on the Monday-night before : And , my Lord , there were two more Gentlemen that heard him as well as I , that he said , That he had been about twenty Miles off in Kent , and that he was newly come to Town . Now , my Lord , I could not imagine for what Reason this Man should say , that he had been out of Town about a Fort-night or three Weeks , when he was in that House but the Monday-night before ; that is , the Night the Murder was committed . Mr. Darnel . Crier , call Mr. Bishop . [ Who appeared and was sworn . ] Mr. Bishop . About three Years ago the Prisoner came to my Master 's Shop to cheapen some Linnen , and when - L. C. J . Hold , what are you doing now ? Are you going to arraign his whole Life ? Away , away , that ought not to be ; that is nothing to the Matter . Have you done , Prisoner ? Mr. Harrison . Yes , my Lord , I have done , I refer my Cause to your Lordship . Then the Court summed up the Evidence very particularly to the Gentlemen of the Jury , as followeth ; L. C. J. Gentlemen of the Jury ; The Prisoner at the Bar , Henry Harrison , stands indicted for the wilful Murder of Dr. Andrew Clenche , who was barbarously murdered on the fourth day of January last : You have heard the Witnesses that have been sworn ; and upon their Testimony , it doth appear that two Persons came to Brownlow-street-End in a Coach after nine a Clock at night , and sent the Coach-man to the Doctor 's House , under pretence to get him to a Patient , a Friend of theirs , that was sick . By this Contrivance , they got him into their Coach , which they had brought for that purpose , and then they ordered the Coach-man to drive to Leadenhall-street ; and when they came about Holborn-Bars , one of them ask 'd the Coach-man why he drove so slow , and bad him drive faster . When they came to Leadenhall-street , then they bad him drive to the Pye-Tavern without Aldgate ; where one of them bad the Coach-man ask for one Hunt ; but he not being there , one of them bad the Coach-man return back , and gave six Pence to the Watch to come through the Gate , which was shut in the mean time ; and when they came to Leadenhall-Market , one of them gave the Coach-man three Shillings and six Pence , and sent him to buy a couple of Fowls ; which the Coach-man did buy , and brought them to the Coach ; but when he came back , he found the Doctor in the body of the Coach leaning against the fore Seat of the Coach , a Handkerchief being tied about his Neck with a Coal in it , placed upon his Wind-pipe ; which Handkerchief and Coal have been produced in Court . The Question is , Gentlemen , Whether the Prisoner at the Bar be Guilty of this base and barbarous Murder ? To prove which , there have been a very long Evidence given , some Positive , some Circumstantial . It has been proved that Dr. Clenche had some Dealings with a Woman named Vanwicke , and had lent her one hundred and twenty Pounds , and had taken a Mortage for it . This Prisoner , Mr. Harrison , was a great Acquaintance , and very intimate with this Woman ; and did concern himself in the management of her Affairs : and because Dr. Clenche did refuse to lend the Woman more Money , therefore he had an Animosity against Dr. Clenche , The Money not being paid to the Doctor as he did expect , he did call it in ; and therefore this Gentlewoman did oftentimes repair to Dr. Glenche to desire farther Time , or Forbearance , because she could not raise or procure the Money elsewhere . That about Michaelmass last it seems she came to a Coffee-house near Warwick-house in Holborn , and there was Mr. Harrison ; where they consulted what to do . And it was agreed , that the Mistress of the House and Mrs. Vanwicke should go to Dr. Clench 's ; but Mr. Harrison should stay behind , for it was not thought convenient that he should go , left he should provoke the Doctor , When they came to the Doctor , Mrs. Vanwicke was very importunate to have some more Money ; but the Doctor would lend her no more . And when they returned to the Coffee-house again , Mr. Harrison enquired what passed between the Doctor and Mrs. Vanwicke . She told him , that the Doctor would not furnish her with any more Money , although she had pressed him to do it , and urged her great Necessities , but advised her to go to Service . Damn him , says Harrison , does he say that a Woman of your Quality should go to Service ? He is a great Rogue , and deserves to have his Throat cut ; but let me alone , I will manage him . At another place there was a Discourse betwixt Mr. Harrison and one Mr. Johnson ; and that the Prisoner did then speak very hard and ill Words of Dr. Clenche : And that Mr. Harrison came frequently to him ; and one time laid his hand upon his Sword , using some menacing Words , but what they were he can not tell : But he likewise says , that at several times he did expostulate with him , and told him , That he would not do any good with such Discourses as these are , & c. That the Mortgage-Money not being paid , it was thought sit , That there should be a Prosecution made to get possession of the mortgaged Estate , and that the Tenants should be forbid to pay their Rents . And Mr. Harrison went to Mrs. West the Tenant , some few days before St. Thomas day last , and demanded the Rent of her . To which she made answer , That Dr. Clenche had forbid the paiment of the Rent to Mrs. Vanwicke . Thereupon Mr. Harrison grew very angry , and answered , That Dr. Clench was a Rogue and a Villain , and bid her that she should not pay him any Rent . And the Witness faith further , That the Doctor being prest to let her have some more Money , refused to do it , because she would spend it all upon Harrison . Then the Counsel for the King called some Witnesses , who gave you account of the Prisoner 's shifting his Lodgings the day before the Murder was done . He takes a Lodging at Mr. Garway 's in Threadneedle-street , on the twenty third day of December , and there he continued till about the first of January . The second of January he was at Garway 's Shop ; and on the Sunday night he came and fetcht away his Things . The Monday after , being the day that this barbarous Fact was committed , he sent a Letter to Mrs. Garway , to acquaint her that he was gone out of Town ; but he left three half Crowns with her Maid to pay for his Lodging . But as to his going out of Town , it was false , for he never went into the Country , but took a Lodging at Mr. Jones 's in Paul 's Church-yard . It 's observable also , that he went for a Parliament-Man . when he lodged at Mr. Garway 's and had his Footman to attend upon him , & c. There it was that he was seen to have an ordinary Handkerchief , and to hold it to the Fire ; which was taken notice of by Mrs. Jackson , the Daughter of Mrs. Garway , which was not sutable , as she thought , to a Parliament-Man 's Quality , but rather fit for a Seaman , for it was like the Apron of the Maid in the House : which hath been shewed in Court , and compared with the Handkerchief that was tied about Dr. Clench 's Neck . She faith it is the same , or very like that which she did see Mr. Harrison hold in his hand . Cartwright the Officer at the Compter , he tells you , that the Sunday night , the day before the Murder , Mr. Harrison came to Wood-street-Compter , and enquired for Mrs. Vanwicke , and that he only was in her Chamber , and no other Body on that side of the House but Mrs. Vanwicke , the Prisoner , and this Cartwright the Keeper , who stood at the Door , and heard Harrison say , That he would have the Blood of that Rogue , and named Clench , or Winch . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , he was not in the Room . L. C. J . No , he was not ; but there were none on that side the House but You , Cartwright , and Mrs. Vanwicke . Now , on the Monday on which this Fact was committed , he having taken a Lodging at Jones his House , he came thither with a Porter , who brought his Portmantua-Trunk about eight a Clock at night ; and after he had been there a little while , he went away . And you are told , by a Gentleman that lodges at the Golden-Key against Fetter-lane end ; That he had some Acquaintance with the Prisoner , that he had lent him a Morning-Gown ; and that about nine a Clock that very night , he came to his Lodging in a Cloak ; and then the Gentleman asked him for his Gown ; and he told him , that he had brought it with him . Thereupon the Gentleman invites Mr. Harrison to stay and sup with him . Mr. Harrison said , he could not stay , for he was engaged ; he must be gone , for that a Gentleman staid in the Street for him to go about extraordinary Business . The Coachman tells you , That near about that time two Men in Fleet-street , near Fetter-lane end , hired his Coach of him to go to Brownlow-street to Dr. Clench 's ; but he ca n't positively say , that the Prisoner at the Bar was one of them , but he swears , he does verily believe that he was one of them . Mr. Harrison . He said before your Lordship , That he could not remember what I had on . L. C. J . Well , well , he doth not remember it now ; but being hired to go to Dr. Clench 's , he drove to the Street end and no further , because the Gate at the lower end was shut up , and he could not turn his Coach in the Street ; but he was sent by them to the Doctor 's , to desire the Doctor to come out to them , and they sat in the Coach in the mean time . The Doctor made haste , and went to them immediately , and they drove away to Leaden-hall , and then to Aldgate ; and they called at the Py-Tavern , and enquired for one Mr. Hunt a Chirurgeon , as I mentioned to you before : He not being there , they returned to drive through Aldgate , gave the Watch six-pence , and passed through the Gate without any manner of notice taken : but if the Watch had done their Duty , it might have been better discovered . But further , the Coachman tells you , that when he came to Leaden-hall Street , they called to him , and directed him to buy one Fowl ; and after that he had been gone a little way from the Coach , they called him back , and bad him take some more Money and buy two Fowls . So he went and bought the Fowls ; but when he came back , the two Gentlemen were gone , and he found the Doctor still in the Coach ; and he not stirring , he thought he had been in Drink : but upon further examination , and calling the Watchman with his Candle , it appeared that the Doctor was strangled with a Handkerchief and a Coal . There is one Mrs. Elianor Ashbolt , who lives in Brownlow-street with her Mother , and had been sent of an Errand ; and between nine and ten of the Clock at Night , she saw the Coachman in Brownlow-street , and thought that those Men in the Coach might put a Trick upon him , by going away without paying him his Fare . And she says further , That by the help of the Lamps she did discern the Face of this Harrison in the Coach ; he had a Cloak on , with a light Perriwig , and looked out of the Coach , and did swear at the Coachman ; and by this means she knew him when she saw him again , to be the same Man , both by his Face and Voice . This Woman indeed was not beforethe Coroner , and she gives you this reason for it , because her Mother was not willing she should be concerned in such a matter as this was ; and what she could say , was not known to Mrs. Clenche until after the second Sessions : And when he was in Newgate , she saw him there , and declared he was the same Man . There was another piece of Evidence , viz . That of the Boy 's , who does not appear , he was examined before the Coroner . There has been Evidence given of ill practice to take him out of the way , and therefore his Affidavit is read for Evidence : He swears he saw two Gentlemen come out of the Coach when it stood in Leaden hall street , and that having seen the Prisoner in Newgate since , doth believe him to be one . This , Gentlemen , is the Sum and Substance of the Evidence for the King , to prove that the Prisoner was one of those that committed the Murder . You have heard likewise what the Prisoner says for himself ; he does undertake to prove that he was in another Place , ( that is ) that he should come into Maccafee 's House in Crown-Court over against Serjeants-Inn in Chancery-lane : and Maccafee , he tells you , that there were some other Company there , and that Harrison came in very cold , and that they went to Cards , and plaid for one Penny a Corner at Whisk ; and that he did continue there from nine till eleven a Clock ; and if he was there then , it is impossible he should be guilty of this Fact , for the Fact was done between the same Hours . Maccafee 's Wife tells you the same , and they both tell you who were there besides , and who plaid together , and are positive that the Prisoner was there . Baker says , That he went away about half an hour after ten at Night , and left Harrison behind him . To confirm this Evidence , they have called two other Witnesses besides the Drawers at the King's-Head Tavern , viz . Mr. Sutton the Surgeon , who lives in Stone-cutters Street , and Mr. Russel : Mr. Sutton says , they had been at the Horseshoe Tavern in Chancery-lane , and called for half a Pint of Sack at the King's-head Tavern when they came by : and as they sat in the Coach , Mr. Harrison came by accidentally , and one of them looking out of the Coach , cries Harry , or Harrison ; and he went to them , and they drank together another half Pint of Sack . As to their meeting with Harrison , and as to other Passages there , Russell says the same ; but as to the time of Night he is not positive . And they sent one of the Drawers to a House in Crown-Court to enquire for some Body there . The Drawers of the King's-Head Tavern , say , That Mr. Sutton and Mr. Russell did call there about that time ; and that they drank two half Pints of Wine : and that when they were drinking , a Man came by with a Hanging-Coat or Cloak on , and drank with them . And one of the Drawers went to call some Body in Crown-Court ; and one of the Company up with his Muff and gave him a slap in the Face . Now this is the Sum and Substance of the Evidence that you have heard on the behalf of the Prisoner , to induce you to believe that he was not the Person that was concerned in the Murder of Doctor Clenche . To which Evidence an Answer hath been offered ; First , As to those Witnesses , Maccafee and his Wife , divers Witnesses have been produced to prove , that they are People of doubtful Credit ; it seems they keep an House of ill Fame . Mr. Harrison . I am glad , my Lord , that I was there . L. C. J . Well , well , Gentlemen , the People of the House are not of very good Reputation , they keep a naughty and a disorderly House , ( if you believe the Witnesses ) you may consider of their Credit . And as to Mr. Baker ; About nine Years since he was convicted of an arrant Cheat , which is no less than Forgery , for altering the Scavenger 's Rate for St. Giles 's Parish , and therefore the less Credit is to be given to his Evidence ; for now it appears that he is a Knave upon Record : and the very Record it self was produced against him , which is true without doubt , not withstanding his pretence of Innocency . What is said by Mr. Russell and Mr. Sutton , I must leave to your consideration ; they had been a drinking , and the Drawer says they were at the King's-Head Tavern at 11 of the Clock at Night . Mr. Harrison the next day after the Murder , met a Gentleman at Joes Coffee-House in Salisbury-Court ; and though he had taken a Lodging in Paul 's Church-Yard , yet he said that he was newly come to Town , and had been in Kent , and had remained there about three Weeks ; and that he wanted a Laundress and a Lodging , although he had not been out of Town , and had taken a Lodging but the day before : And then he told the Witness who discoursed with him about the Death of Dr. Clenche , That he had formerly loved him , but he said he had been of late a barbarous Rogue to a poor Gentlewoman a Friend of his ; and that the just Judgment of God had fallen upon him for so doing , and that he would write to her to give her an account of it ; and advise her to write to Mrs. Clenche , and to tell her that she was a Widow now as well as Mrs. Vanwick ; and he thought by that Means to move Mrs. Clenche to pity her , being a Widow as well as her self : And that whilst they were talking thus , one Mr. Ravenscroft tells him , that Dr. Clenche was murdered , and that a Bully of the Town , that belonged to a Gentlewoman in the Compter , one Mrs. Vanwick , was suspected . At which Mr. Harrison was much startled , and said , That no one was concerned with that Gentlewoman but himself ; and for ought he knew , he might be taken up for it . This is that which he said . Now what said Mr. Harrison farther for himself ? Why , says he , this Gentlewoman is not in Prison at the Prosecution of Dr. Clenche , and was not so affirmed , but so reported ; and whether it were so or no is no great matter . Gentlemen , you ought to consider of the Evidence that you have heard against him , and also to weigh well the Evidence he hath brought for himself . It is most plain , if you believe the Witnesses , that Mr. Harrison was concerned for this Woman Vanwick , and hath threatned Dr. Clenche , called him Rogue and Rascal , and said , that he deserved to have his Throat cut ; that Harrison went under a Disguise for some time before the Murder . You have had an Account of the Handkerchief , what kind of Handkerchief Harrison had , and what Handkerchief wastaken about Dr. Clench 's Neck , you have seen : And you heard what Evidence was given by Mr. Humstond ; how the Prisoner was with him about nine a Clock that Night ; and how he refused to stay and sup with Mr. Humstond . If Mr. Harrison had no earnest business , one would have thought he might have staid with Mr. Humstond better than to have gone to an Ale-House in Crown-Court , and plaid at Cards at one Penny a piece a Corner ; he might have had better Fare no doubt . The Witnesses for the Prisoner say for him , That he came to Macafee 's House about 9 a Clock at night , and staid till eleven : That is contrary to that Evidence given for the King , viz . That he was in the Coach at Brownlow-street End ; for if he was at Macafee 's House all the time they mention , it is impossible he should be guilty . All those things are under your serious Consideration . You had best go together , and if you are not satisfied upon the Evidence you have heard , that he is guilty , then you ought to acquit him ; but if you are satisfied that he did commit this Murder , then you ought to find him guilty . Then the Jury withdrew , and the Court adjourned for half an hour ; and when they were returned , the Jury came to give their Verdict ; and being called over , answered to their Names ; and Mr. Harrison was brought to the Bar . Cl . of Arraign . Gentlemen , Are you all agreed of your Verdict ? Jury . - Yes . Cl . of Arraign . Who shall say for you ? Jury . - Our Foreman . Cl . of Arraign . Henry Harrison , Hold up thy Hand . [ Which he did . ] Look upon the Prisoner ; How say you ? Is he guilty of the Felony and Murder whereof he stands indicted , or not guilty ? Foreman . Guilty of wilful Murder . Cl . of Arraign . What Goods or Chattels ? & c. Foreman . None that we know of . Major Richardson . Look to him , he is found guilty of wilful Murder . Cl . of Arraign . Then hearken to your Verdict as the Court hath recorded it . You say that Henry Harrison is guilty of the Felony and Murder whereof he stands indicted , but that he had no Lands , nor Tenements , Goods nor Chattels , at the time of the Felony and Murder committed , nor at any time since to your Knowledg : And so you say all ? Jury . - Yes . Then the Prisoner was remanded to Newgate until the last Day of the Sessions , and then he was brought to the Bar to receive Sentence of Death . Cl . of Arraign . Henry Harrison , Hold up thy Hand . [ Which he did . ] Henry Harrison , You stand convicted of Felony and Murder , for the Murder of Dr. Andrew Clenche : What can you say for your self why Judgment should not be given against you , to die according to Law ? Mr D. Recorder . Mr Harrison , You have been Indicted , Arraign 'd and Convicted of Felony and Murder , for the Murder of Dr Andrew Clenche . You have had a long , and a fair and favourable Tryal , as any Person that ever have been Tryed at this Bar . The Jury that has passed upon your Life and Death hath Convicted you , and the Court are now ready to do their last Act , which is to pronounce that Sentence that the Law does inflict upon such Crimes as you stand Convicted of . Mr. Harrison . I expect no Mercy here , therefore I humbly desire you would interceed to the Queen , that I may have twelve Days allowed me , in order to my better Preparation for Death . Mr. D. Recorder . - Well . Mr. Harrison , I must needs acknowledg , that I was Tryed before the best of Judges , my Lord-Chief-Justice Holt , but one thing I think strange , that my Witnesses should be examin 'd singly , and not the King 's . Mr. D. Recorder . That is no more than what is usual , the Counsel for the King and Queen requested it , and you did not . Mr. Harrison . I begg 'd that I might have timely notice of my Tryal , and I had not ; there were seven People in my Company at the time when this black and bloody Murder was done , and I could not get them to be here . Mr. D. Recorder . You have had a long time to get them ready , and you pressed on your own Tryal , which you should not have done if you had not been ready . Mr. Harrison . I humbly submit . Then the usual Sentence of Death was pronounc 'd against him , and he was Remanded to Newgate .
