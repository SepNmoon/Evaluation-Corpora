Isaac Lacour . On the 25th of October last , I was coming from the other End of the Town , with my Brother Dr Lacour , and at the Corner of the Old-Bailey I felt a Fellow fumbling at my Pocket ; I laid hold of the Prisoner at the Bar ; said I , you have robbed me of my Handkerchief : Says my Brother , he has not only robbed you of your Handkerchief , but has just dropped your Snuff-box into the Channel ; and it was taken out of the Channel wet : Said I , do you look after the Box , and I will secure the Fellow . + - I am positive I felt that Fellow at my Pocket . - I took him immediately : I could not find the Handkerchief upon him , but believe it to be taken out of my Pocket at that Time . - I did not know he had taken the Snuff-box , but my Brother saw him drop it ; I charged a Constable with him , and the next Day he was carried before one of the Aldermen , and committed to Newgate . + The Breaks , in This and other Trials , are to shew , that what follows is in Answer to Questions put to the Witnesses ; which Questions are omitted , when the Answers sufficiently denote what they were . Dr Philip Lacour .

Prisoner . As I was coming by Fleet-ditch , I bought a Halfpenny worth of Walnuts , and eat them all the Way I went , and threw the Shells away , and the Gentleman took it to be a Snuff-box , when it was only a Parcel of Walnut-shells , and nothing else . Dr Lacour . It did not found any Thing like Walnuts , it fell like something heavy . Prisoner . I am a Porter ; I fetch Carcasses from Clare-Market , and I desire I may have my Trial put off ; it is very hard I should be cast without any Body to speak for me . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation .

I am Servant to Mr Demee ; last Tuesday was fe'nnight , as I was shutting up Shop , and had put up the Shutters on one Side , and stood holding the Pin for the Boy , who was on the inside , something came trailing against my Legs , and a Gentleman passing by , said to me , That was taken off of your Bulk . - It was six Yards of Check Linnen , belonging to Daniel Demee ; one End of it was under a Man 's Coat , and the other trailing in the Street ; I pursued him , and he turned down Duke's-Place , against Mr Smith 's Back door , by the Mitre-Tavern : I went to lay hold of him , or strike him , I can not tell which ; he turned about and said to me , G - d damn you , what do you want ? He ran again , and I after him ; the Check was under his Coat just before ; said he , what do you want ? I have nothing ; a Man came up to me and said , the Goods are carried back to your Shop ; when I came back to the Shop , the Check was brought back , and a Hat ; this is his Hat , - I know it , because I was in our Shop when he was asked whether this was his Hat , and he said Yes . Isaac Lacour . [ the Prosecutor in the former Trial ] As to the Knowledge of the Person , I can not say any Thing ; I was coming by Mr Demee 's Door , and saw a Fellow trailing a Piece of Check Linnen ; says I , to the Person at the Door , Look after that Piece of Check Linnen , it is trailing along the Ground ; he could not draw it in so fast , but some of it trailed after him , I believe about two Yards ; - I think I remember it again ; for I saw the Piece of Linnen afterwards in the Middle of Duke's-Place , upon the Ground ; said I to a Man , take up the Piece of Linnen and the Hat , and I will shew you the Shop where the Linnen was taken from ; I went to the Shop and delivered the Piece and the Hat into the Shop , - I believe it to be the Piece , and the Hat is like that which was delivered into the Shop . Prisoner . My Lord , please to ask whether I was the Person that took the Cloth ? Lacour . I do not know whether he is the Man that took away the Check . Court . Mr. Demee 's Man says you are the Person that took the Cloth . Prisoner . I am innocent of it . Mr Paget . I met the Prisoner with a Piece of Linnen , dragging along the Ground , just by Mr Salter 's Shop , within two Doors of Mr Demee 's . - I am sure that is the Man , and that is the Linnen : One End was under his Arm , and the other dragging upon the Ground , when they cry 'd out stop Thief : I had like to have run over a Girl , or I had taken it from under his Arm : He threw the Check down ; I said to a Gentleman , Take Care of the Check ; and I ran after him , and took him . Prisoner . Mind what you are upon , young Man : I am as innocent as the Child unborn . Paget . I am sure he flung the Check from him : then I ran after him , and in about two or three Minutes I took him . Prisoner . One hit me , and another hit me . I am an innocent Man . Ask him if he saw me with it under my Arm ? Paget . I am sure he is the Person that had the Check under his Arm . Prisoner . I am innocent of the Matter : I am but just come from Sea . Mary Paget . There was a great Cry of stop Thief , upon which my Husband and I ran down : I saw a Piece of Check and a Hat lie pretty near one another : A Gentleman took it and carried it to Mr Demee 's Shop . - I did not see him drop it , it was dropp 'd before I saw it . George Wardley . I am a Constable ; I live under Aldgate : I do not know any thing as to the Fact , but as I brought him along , he desired I would send to his Friends . I sent a Watchman to acquaint them that the Constable had sent him to Newgate ; there was a Woman made Answer , I am very glad of it , for he has a very bad Character . - We are very much pester 'd with these Fellows .

She acquainted me with it : I let it lie that Night . Next Day I called to a Neighbour , and got a Pair of Tongs and took it out of the Vault . I pulled off one Linnen and then another , and discovered a Child 's Hand and Arm . I was very much frightened , and went to a Justice of the Peace , to know what to do ( for I did not know the Nature of the Affair ) he ordered me to go to the Coroner . - It was discovered on Sunday Night between seven and eight o'Clock , but I did not take it out till Monday the 11th of October .

Q . Was the Closet locked ? Tullock . Her Brother was mov 'd from that House to another . - The House was empty when I went to look for these Things ; I got the Key of the Landlord , and went and found them there ; these are the Things . - They are convenient Things for a Person in those Circumstances .

[ The Prisoner 's Brother . ] When I examined her how she came to sign her Confession , when she can neither read nor write , she said she did not know what she did .

Q . How do you know the Wind did not blow the Window open ? Hodges . No , I am sure it did not ; it has been but lately mended ; he cut the Lead , and took out two Panes of Glass : - I know it , because the Lead was cut , and the Glass gone : - he left nothing behind him but a dark Lanthorn : He had a Light when I came into the Square , and it was put out the Minute he heard us come up to the Window . - I found upon him a Couple of Knives , and an Iron Chissel . They , and the Lanthorn , were produced in Court . Prisoner . Please to ask her what Answer I made when she laid hold of me ? Hodges .

The first Thing I saw when I went into the House , was a Dark-Lanthorn , the next was four Plates , which were moved from the Shelf to the Window , ready to be delivered out , as I supposed . - When he was brought back , he was told they did not suppose he had been long there , and the Prisoner said , No Body knows how long I have been there .

I have known the Prisoner about a Year ; he is a Weaver , I live in the House with him : He was going to move his Loom to his Father 's . I know nothing of him but what is very honest , and if he had a Mind to have been a Thief , he might have stole a great many things out of that House . Richard Baxter .

When he was before the Alderman I was with him , and the Prosecutrix made an Affidavit , that this Dark-Lanthorn was found upon him , and afterwards she said it was found in the House . Said the Alderman , I thought you said the Dark-Lanthorn was found upon him . No , said she then , it was found in the House . When a Person is upon Oath , they ought to be very careful .

May it please you , my Lord , I will tell you the Story as well as I can . This young Man is my Kinsman : He said to me one Day , as I was going Home from the India House , that he had something to tell me . Says he , I have lost my Watch .

I took two Men and a Constable , and went to the House where she said it was sold , and staid till ten o'Clock at Night , and could not find the People . We carried her before Alderman Bernard , and she confessed before him , that she sold it for 22 s. 6 d. and he committed her to Newgate . We went to a House where there sat an old Woman , which by the Description we had of her , was the Person she had sold it to . Do you sell a Dram ? said I . She said , Yes . So we had a Quartern of Gin . Said I , I come to enquire after a Watch that is pawn 'd here , and I am credibly informed , by one that is in Prison , that you have it ; and if you do not return it , there is a Constable just by , and you shall go too . Said my Cousin , before I was aware , if you will let me have the Watch , I will give you the 22 s. 6 d. that you gave for it . Said she , I believe I can help you to it , but I have it not in the House . I went to an Alehouse at next Door , to enquire after this Woman 's Character , and told the Woman the Story . Said she , if she promis 'd to get it for you again , you will be sure of having it ; and the Woman of the Alehouse lent me 22 s. 6 d. to pay for the Watch ; there was a little Girl came to me , and gave me a Tap on the Back , and bid me come along with her . She led me into a narrow Passage in Rag-Fair , and bid me a good Night , and in that narrow Passage , I had the Watch put into my Hand ; but who gave it me , I can not tell , whether it was a Man or a Woman ; the Person put a Brown Paper into my Hand , and in that Paper was the Watch .

Mary Squire . On the 15th of October in the Evening , between the Hours of Nine and Ten , I was going down Tavistock-street , and was very much frightened with this Fellow 's ( the Prisoner at the Bar ) standing against a Wall , so that I did not know which Way to go ; but I went down the Street and turned the Corner , and three or four Doors beyond the Salutation Alehouse , I saw him again : I found a Touch at my Pocket , and presently I was knock 'd down , and my Pocket tore from me , my Knees were very much cut and bruised with the Fall ; the Person that knocked me down , came behind me , for I saw him over my Shoulder ; he was a Soldier , I took particular Notice of him . - It was a darkish Night ; but by the Light of the Salutation , I could see him very plain . - I was very much afraid of him , seeing him standing with his Back against a dead still so that I took particular Notice , and had a full View of him ; I am very positive the Prisoner is the Man . Mr Rock apprehended the Prisoner in a Minute or two after I cried out , Stop Thief , Stop Thief , Soldier , & c. Q . Was he taken while he was in Sight , or was he got out of your Sight ? Mary Squire . I can not say but he was got out of my Sight : I heard my Pocket was found a Quarter of an Hour after he was taken ; there was a Man said , he would help me to my Pocket again for a Guinea . - I never had my Pocket or any of my Things again ; - there was in it a Snuff-Box , a Pocket-Book , and 2 s. 1 d. in Money . Prisoner . She says now , there was 2 s. 1 d. in her Pocket ; and she said before the Justice , there was but one Shilling ; she swore before the Justice , that I was the Man , because I had got a red Coat on ; and she said there , that she could not be certain to my Face , for she only saw my Back . Squire . He was the Person , upon the Oath that I have taken ; I viewed his Face by the Light at the Salutation , or I would not have swore so positively to him ; for I have a greater Regard to Life . Prisoner . Was it a Moon light Night , or a dark Night ? Squire . It was dark , but the Light came against the Wall . Prisoner . I am innocent of the Fact , I am sure . Mr. Huggins . I am one of the Constables of Covent Garden Parish ; I took Charge of the Prisoner at the Bar , on the 15th of October , and searched him , to see if I could find any Fire-Arms , or any Thing that might endanger us in carrying him before a Magistrate ; but I could not find any , or any Thing that Mrs Squire had charged him with ; but there was another Pocket dropped from between his Coat and Waistcoat . Prisoner . I told him I found the Pocket , for it does not belong to she . John Rawlinson . I am a Watchman in Charles-Street ; on the 15th of October , between Nine and Ten , I heard a Cry of Stop Thief ; I stood still a little while to hear where it was : I perceived it was in Tavistock Street ; then I heard a Cry of Stop Thief , Soldier , Thief , & c. I seized him , - he fell into my Hands with a great deal of Easiness ; he made no Opposition . but said , he would submit to me ; and as there was no Watchman came immediately to me , I desired some Gentlemen to help me to hold him , and I held him , by their Assistance , till Mrs Squire came up ; she said , she had been robbed , and that she was very positive that the Prisoner was the Man ; I bid her look in his Face , and see if he was the Man ; she said , she was positive he was the Man that robbed her ; Mr Huggins the Constable , searched him ; but the Prisoner did not give any Account how he came by the Pocket that was found upon him : - He said he would submit , these were his very Words . Mrs Squire was very faint when she came up , and was very confident that he was the Man ; there was one Mrs Langley 's Pocket found in the Place where he robbed Mrs Squire Prisoner . Do you say you were the Man that stopped me ? Rawlinson . Yes ; I do . Prisoner . This Man says he stopped me ; were there two Men that stopped me ? Rawlinson . I stopped him , and then he was with out any Hat and running . - he did not resist Prisoner . I had no Occasion to resist , if I was not guilty of the Fact , and I am sure I am innocent of it . William Rock . On the 15th of October , between Nine and Ten in the Evening , I heard a Cry of Stop Thief ; I perceived a Man running , and was waiting for him ; I stood looking on both Sides of the Way , for I could hear the Tread as he came along ; when he came pretty near me , I caught hold of his Coat ; the Cry was Stop Thief , Stop Soldier , there was no Body pursued him , and no Body but he and I in the Street , as I could see : He slipped out of my Hand , and the Watchman coming along , got hold of him ; when the Watchman had hold of him , I went to the Prosecutrix , and brought her to the Prison . - I was the first Person that laid hold of him . - it was neither Dark nor Light ; it was a Starlight Night . - I found out the Woman that owned this Pocket , which was found upon him , by advertising it ; but she is since absconded . Prisoner . One of the Evidence says , there was a great Mob in the Street , and the other says , there was no Body in the Street . Rock . When you came to the upper End of the the Street , there were five or six People ; but that was the second Time of my coming up with you , for you got away from me the first . Prisoner . I never saw him before in my Life : Did I make any Resistance ? Rock . He slipped away , and got about ten or a dozen Yards from me ; I had hold of him but slightly by the Coat , - he had no Hat on , - the Street was very quiet till after the Cry of Stop Thief , and then there were some People got together . The Prisoner in his Defence , said , On Friday Night I was in Liquor , and quarrelled with a Man , and in that Quarrel I lost my Hat ; coming along the Street , I heard a Cry of Stop Thief , and I said , where , where ? and in running along , I met that Man , and he took me hold by the Collar , and let me go again ; and presently this Watchman took hold of me ; then I said to him , keep me if you will , for I have done nothing , for I knew myself innocent ; then they searched me , and said , here is a Pocket . Ask them , whether I did not bid you shew it to the Woman , and said , if she had a Right to it , I would suffer Death ; and the Woman still insisting upon it , that it was a Soldier who robbed her , and because there was ne'er another Soldier in the Street , it must be me . James Massey . [ Call 'd by the Prisoner . ] I believe I can contradict what has been said in Court , for I was the Person that took him . - I serve one Mr Swinney , belonging to the Custom-House : I was going to my Master 's Duty about ten Minutes after Nine , in the Evening on the 15th of October , I heard some People cry out stop Thief , and I cry 'd out stop Thief : There was a Woman before me , and she jump 'd up upon a Door-way , and the Prisoner came running along , and ran against me ; and as the Gentleman , the Prisoner at the Bar , came running against me , he hit his Foot against a Stone , and fell down about five Yards from me : Then I cry 'd out , who calls stop Thief ? but no body answered . I called out again , who calls stop Thief ? still no body answered . This Person , the Prisoner at the Bar , lay still , and did not offer to stir : I said , if he offered to stir a Foot further I would knock him down ; for as there was a Cry of stop Thief , I believed he was the Thief . He put his Hands in this Manner in his Bosom , and did not offer to move . I called out again , who calls stop Thief ? and no Answer was made ; presently there came up three People : I asked what 's the Matter ; they cry 'd out stop Thief , and so did I ; then the Prisoner came running against me ; I took hold of him , believing he might be the Thief . Damn you says he , let me go : He was gone about four or five Yards from me , then they cry 'd out stop Thief , Soldier : Then said I , do not let him go : Then some body took hold of him before I did the second Time ; then I called out for a Watchman , and desired him to come and take Charge of him ; he refus 'd it : There came a Man running up , and asked where he was ? Said I , do not hurry your self , for here he is safe : Then there came a Man with a Napkin Cap tied about his Head , and said , I believe that is the Man . I said again to the Watchman , now will you take Charge of him ; which he refused , then said I , damn him . let him go ; but when Mrs Squire came up , she said , that is the Man that knock 'd me down , and took my Pocket from me . Now said I to the Watchman , will you take Charge of him , and then he did . Q . Did she give any Reason why he should 's the Person ? Massey . No : but when she said he was the Person , I said , if he went any further I would knock him down . Prisoner . You see , my Lord , they do it for the Sake of the Reward , for one Witness contradicts another . Guilty . Death . 27.

On Tuesday the 30th of November , I was out ; the Prisoner at the Bar , said to his Mistress , I will stay up for my Master : No Tom , said she , I will stay up , you may go to Bed ; she sat up for me : I came Home about eleven o'Clock , and sat down by the Fire talking with my Wife ; said she , Mr Greener , do you hear how the Bed cracks ? I said , It is an old Bedstead , and they are subject to crack . In about a Quarter of an Hour , the Bed made the same Noise again . Now , said she , Do not you hear it . Yes , said I , I do . Then , said she , Go and enquire what is the Reason of it . I did not go directly ; then , said she , If you will not go , I will . Accordingly she went . - I know no more of the Affair , but what she told me ; but I heard no more Noise of the Bed after . Q . Why did not you bring your Wife ? Greener . I might have brought her , but she is not very well , and out of Modesty , she did not care to come . Q . When was it this Witness told you of the Fact ? Greener . Not at all ; he told no Body of it . Q . How came this Man to be taken up ? You can tell that without telling what your Wife said . Greener . I knew nothing of it 'till the 30th of November .

Thomas Bartlet . I live at the Horns , in St John-Street ; The latter End of October , or the Beginning of November , the Prisoner at the Bar came to my House one Evening , with a large Pottage-pot , ( I thought to leave it there , as there is most commonly a great many Goods left at my House ) very much fuddled ; Landlord , said she , my Mother is lately dead at Highgate , and I have a Mind to change this Pot for a smaller one . No , said I , I do not Care to do it ; She said , I must have Money to Night . I said , Be persuaded by me , and leave it till To-morrow and consider of it . And with great Persuasion , I prevail 'd on her so to do ; she desired to have some Money upon it , which I let her have , I think it was six or seven Shillings : One Day , this Mrs Tipler came in ; said she , Do you know any Thing of a Pottage-pot being left here for me ? I told her it was in the Kitchen : Mrs Tipler went into the Kitchen , said she , This is my Pot , it was stole from me .

On the 30th of October in the Forenoon , I was informed that he left the House at 8 in the Morning with a Bundle under his Arm ; and my Servants thought he would not return any more . I went into the Compting-House , examined the Cash , and found a Deficiency of 90 l. 15 s. I suspected him , because he was the only Servant who had Access to the Compting-House . The Money was in a Desk in the Compting-House , of which he had a Key , but did not take it away with him . We enquired what Places he frequented , and endeavoured to pursue him : The same Morning , about twelve o'Clock , my Partner , Samuel Slater , apprehended him at his Barber 's , and he was brought back to the Compting-House by my Partner and David Todd . - I was there when he was brought in . He seemed a little confounded : I told him I wondered he should take away such a Sum of Money . I sent for a Constable , and ordered my Servant and the Constable to search him . The Prisoner put his Hand in his Pocket , and took out six Moidores and one Guinea ; and in a little Time he owned the Fact , and that he had taken out of the Desk forty Moidores and thirty-five Guineas ; that he went to a Gaming-House , and had lost it all but this . Upon searching his Pockets there was this Letter found , which was then sealed up , and the Wafer hardly dry ; it is directed to Mr Fuller , a worthy Gentleman whom he had lived with . I believe it to be his Hand-writing . The Letter was then read , viz . To Mr Fuller , Writing Master , in Ingram-Court , Fenchurch-Street . SIR , `` I Doubt not but by this Time you 're informed `` of my unfortunate Conduct , which has put `` a Period to Happiness in this Life , and have nothing `` to hope for , but to drag on a miserable `` and disgraceful Life , ne'er more to expect any `` Favour from that Part of Mankind which I `` flatter 'd myself have some generous Sentiments `` of me .

He owned he took the Money laid in the Indictment out of the Desk in the Compting-House , and had lost it at a Gaming-House . Prisoner . My having a Key , was the Reason of their suspecting me . I desire he may be asked , whether he does not know other People , who have not been concerned in the Compting-House , that have defrauded these Gentlemen ? Todd . There 's no body trusted with the Key , but my Master and himself . Prisoner . Mr. Slater 's Son had a Key of the Compting-house . Todd .

He owned to me that he took forty Moidores and thirty-five Guineas , and that he went to my Lord Mordington 's , where he was all Night , and there lost the rest of the Money . Prisoner .

I happened to be the unfortunate Person to recommend him to that Gentleman Mr Brown ; but before I did it , I desired a Friend of mine to enquire his Character of Mr Blade , who keeps a Boarding-School at Enfield , and I was in Hopes he would have been a useful Member of the Public ; and if he can find Favour of the Court , I hope it will have a good Influence upon him .

I beg Favour of the honourable Court . Guilty . Death . N. B . After the Jury had given their Verdict , Mr Brown acquainted the Court , that by the strictest Enquiry he could make concerning the Prisoner , he had no Reason to believe he had behaved otherwise than well till this Time , and therefore desired he might be recommended as a fit Object of his Majesty 's Mercy ; and the rather , for that when he came Home again the next Morning , he might have taken a larger Sum . 36.

Prisoner I was Servant with Mr Tappin from the 27th of April , till the Time I came to Newgate , and never was a Day out of his Service . Lawrence Leech . The Prisoner , John Welch , and I , met on the 13th of September , at the King's-Head at Islington , and drank two or three Pints of Beer : Mead said , his Master had got two very good black Geldings , and we agreed that Night , to meet at Mr . Tapping 's Cow-Layer , and take them away : - It was pretty soon in the Evening , but I can not tell what Time . - It was before Bed-time ; I was in Company with the Prisoner , and John Welch , when we took the two Geldings away . - Howard and Welch were here last Sessions , and acquitted : I was in Jail in the Borough , and could not appear here against them : Mead brought a Bridle with him , and helped to catch the Horses , and John Welch had another . John Welch took hold of one Horse , and the Prisoner said , that was not the right Horse ; and he shewed us another , which he said was the right one ; the Prisoner turned the Horses out of the Field , and desired we would send him his part of the Money they were sold for . - Jack Welch , Tom Howard , and I , carried them to Wooburn . - Jack Welch sold the Horses for ten Pounds and a Crown , and a Horse in Exchange . He gave me two Guineas , Tom Howard two Guineas , and saved two Guineas in order to give the Prisoner at the Bar ; but I do not know whether he gave them to him or not : I have not seen the Prisoner since . Welch , the Prisoner , and I , were together when we agreed to go to Wooburn . - I kept a Public House in Islington . - I work for my Living . Mead . Ask him , why he did not put me in his Information before Justice Hammond ? He had stole other Horses , and was taken up in Surrey , and carried before Justice Hammond in the Borough . Leech . I was taken up at Croydon-Fair , and carried before a Justice there , and he told me , if I had any Confederates , and would discover them , I should find more Favour ; Justice Hammond did not commit me . Mead . He impeached Tom Howard and Jack Welch ; ask my Master whether he did not know that Lawrence Leech , Thomas Howard , and John Welch had sold his Horses at Wooburn before last Sessions . Tappin . Yes , I did ; but I was not informed then that my Man was concerned with them ; it was not till after they were cleared . Mead . After they were cleared , Leech impeached me in order to save his own Neck . Leech . I did not know I should have any Benefit by this . Q . What Countryman are you ? Leech . I am an Irishman , and so is he . Patrick Holland . I am an Irishman : On one Monday , about ten Days before Michaelmas . - 't is September . - I can not tell what Month it is . - The next Month is November . - It was the last Month in the Harvest Quarter . - It was about ten Days before Michaelmas , about ten o'Clock in the Morning , I happened to meet with Henry Mead , and Lawrence Leech , coming through the Street . Mead was going for a Loaf to Mr Reed the Baker 's , at Islington . Leech asked him , if he would spend three Half-pence : Mead said , he could not stay for his Master was going to London to advertise two of the best Horses he had , which were lost , and he must go Home to mind his Business . Q . What Month was that ? Holland . I can not tell ; I am no Scholar , I can neither read nor write . - I live in Islington , and live every where , where I can get my Living honestly by labouring . Q . How long have you known the Prisoner ? Holland . I have known him but since the last May of all ; I have seen both of them very often ; Henry Mead was Mr Tappin 's Servant , and Lawrence Leech used to go to Hay-making Work ; we began about Hay-making about the 1 st Day of May . Q . When did you first know their Names ? Holland . It was in June ; I became acquainted with them both in June ; I knew Leech at Mrs Harris 's , at High-Berry-Barn . - I had no real Acquaintance with them 'till September . Wm Adams . I live at the Plough at Islington , I have kept the House about fourteen Years . I know Mead perfectly well , I have known him above a Year : I never knew him guilty of any Misdemeanor in my Life ; he never was any great Customer ; I do not come upon such an Account . - I believe he has drank two or three Times at my House . - I know nothing more of him : He looked after Mr Tappin 's Cows when I first knew him . John Holland . I am an Irishman : I have known the Prisoner going on two Years , by working with him at my Mistress Harris 's at High-Berry-Barn . Q . What Relation are you to Patrick Holland ? John Holland . He is my Brother-in-Law . Mead lodged at my House , next Door to the Plough at Islington , six Months : He came there in July last . - July was Twelve-months : He had a Fit of Illness , and the Parish put him into the Work-House . - I know very little of Leech . Mary Adams . I keep the Plough at Islington ; the Prisoner has drank at our House several Times . I met him one Night , and he conducted me as far as Sadler's-Wells ; and he was very civil : I know of no Misbehaviour in him since I have known him , which is about a Year and an half . Jonathan Johnson . I liv 'd with Mr Hawes , at the Thatch'd-House at Islington ; he used to come and drink there : I never saw any Thing but what was very civil in him . Acquitted . 38.

Vide p. 31 . No . 77 . Samuel Porter . On the 26th of October , I happened to be coming down Playhouse-Passage in Drury-Lane , and I met the Prisoner at the Bar ; she asked me if I would give her a Dram : I went into a House , and called for it ; I pulled some Money out of my Pocket , and she snatched Six-pence out of my Hand , and I dropped a Moidore down upon the Floor ; she snatched it up , and kept it , and would not return it : I sent for a Constable , and carried her before Justice Frasier : She was searched , and it was found upon her . Joseph Richardson , the Constable , was called , but he did not appear . Porter . The Constable was here just now ; and had the Moidore sealed up . Prisoner . I had been at a Chandler's-Shop in Red Lyon Court , for a Pennyworth of Bread and Cheese , and a Pint of Beer , and met the Prosecutor ; said I , Will you go and drink a Dram ? He turned about , What , Nanny ! said he . Yes , said I . He asked me where I liv 'd , I told him at the Corner of Playhouse-Passage . Said I , You are grown so poor , I did not know you . Said he , Will you treat me with a Dram ? If you have no Money , said I , I will ; says he , you are a good Girl , I will give you one . We agreed to toss up Heads or Tails , who should treat : He tossed up the Moidore , and I took it up , and said , there was neither Head nor Tail upon it ; so he carried me before a Justice : I went on my own Accord , without any Constable . I had the Moidore in my Hand all the Time . Acquitted . 38 , 39 . + Lot Cavenagh * , and + Cordelia Taylor , were indicted for assaulting William Taylor on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him one Fustian Frock with 12 Plate Buttons , Value 40 s. one white Duffel Coat , Value 15 s. one Cloth Waistcoat , Value 5 s. one Pair of Buckskin Breeches , Value 10 s , one Perriwig , Value 10 s. a Hat , Value 5 s. and a Pair of Silver Buckles , Value 6 s.

See their Trial , PERRY Mayor , Sessions 3 . No . 127. William Taylor . On Sunday , the 3d of October , I dressed my self to take a Walk , and went to one Beswell 's in Tyburn Road ; there I met with William Wilson ; says he , How do you do ? wo n't you drink with me ? We went into the back Room , and that Man was there , I think his Name is Cavenagh ; we staid there till between two and three o'Clock ; they persuaded me to go along with them , and we went to one Gascoign 's , in Hockley in the Hole ; they asked me to stay Supper ; which I agreed to : We went up one Pair of Stairs , and there was that Woman , the Prisoner ; I staid till nigh eleven o'Clock , and as I was coming away , it began to rain , so I did not care for going Home that Night , and asked if I could lie there ; they told me I might ; says I to the Woman of the House , Will you please to call me up betimes . ( for being a Butcher I was obliged to get up early to go to Market . ) She said she would , but I happened to get up my self ; I believe it was then a little after three : I went out and pulled the Door after me ; I had got but a little Way in Hockley in the Hole Road , before the two Prisoners attack 'd me ; Cavenagh presented a Pistol to me , and bid me stand and deliver my Money ; and she stood over me with a Hanger in her Hand . I said I had but Three-pence . ( He took me into a convenient Place that goes from Hockley in the Hole Road to Saffron-Hill . ) Says he , Damn you , if you speak a Word , I will blow your Brains out . Damn him , says she , shoot him , for he knows us ; but he would not . Cordelia Taylor . God forgive you , Billy . Wm Taylor . He took my Hat and Wig off , and she stood with her Apron up , and he threw them into her Lap , and then she bid him take my Cloaths off , which he did . - He took from me a Dussel Great-Coat , a Silver Plate-button 'd Frock , a black Cloth Waistcoat , a Pair of Buckskin Breeches , and a Pair of Silver Buckles ; he took all but my Buckles , and she took them out of my Shoes : Says she , Do not let him have his Wedges , for they are Silver . After he was taken up , I saw him at the New Goal , on the other Side of the Water , with my Frock upon his Back , and my Wig upon his Head . Court . How do you know the Prisoners were the Persons that robbed you ? Wm Taylor . It was a Moon-light Night , and I saw their Faces as plain as I do now . Lot Cavenagh . Have not you and I been as intimate as two own Brothers ? Wm Taylor . I have seen him two or three Times with one Wm Wilson ; I was no father intimate with him than being acquainted by drinking together , and saying , how do you do , if I happen 'd to meet him . Q . How came they to let you go away after they had robbed you ? Wm Taylor . I do not know ; it was their good Will not to Murder me ; if they had killed me , I could not have gone away then . Q . Where did you go afterwards ? Wm Taylor . I went back again to the House ; where I lay : I do not know the Man , but the Woman is here . Cor . Taylor . Billy , you know the Man very well , Did not you take a Lodging there for me ? Q . Were not you and she well acquainted together at that House ? Wm Taylor . I never lived with her - I have been pretty conversant with her ; but I never was in Company with her there , till that Sunday Night . Cor . Taylor . He was frequently with me at that House . - This Gascoign is a Thief-taker : Wm Taylor gave Lot Cavenagh the Coat for Money that he owed him . Wm Taylor . I never owed Lot Cavenagh a Farthing in my Life . Cor . Taylor . This is an entire Piece of Jealousy , because he thinks I have been great with this Man . Q . Did you and she ever lie together ? Wm Taylor . I believe I have lain with her , but there is no great Matter in that , for Whores will lie with any Body . Every Body knows both of them to be Thieves ; they have robbed me twice . - I have been Familiar with her , but I never took a Lodging for her . Cor . Taylor . The first Lodging he ever took me to , was at this Gascoign 's , the Thief-taker , and he allowed me nine Shillings a Week . Wm Taylor . I never did take a Lodging for her , nor allow her nine Shillings a Week . Cor . Taylor . Have you not paid Gascoign Money that I have run up , when you have been absent ? Wm Taylor . No . Cor . Taylor . He has been jealous of me a great while , and I can not say , but at last I gave him Reason to be so : I can not say but I did : He has swore several Robberies against me out of Revenge ; he swore that I robbed him of seven Shillings , and has had a Warrant out against me for assaulting him . Alice Barron . I am Servant to Mr Gascoign , at the Corner of Summer's-Street , in Hockley in the Hole . Prisoners . That is Gascoign 's Wife the Thief-taker . Barron . The two Prisoners at the Bar had a Room at my Master 's House about a Fortnight ; and one Sunday Evening about two Months ago ; the Prisoner Cavenagh , this Wm Taylor , and Mr Wilson 's Son , came to our Door in a Coach ; the Coach happened to turn over at our Door ; when the Coach was turned up again , and the Coachman gone , Cavenagh asked Mr Taylor if he would not go up to Supper ; he said , he did not care if he did ; they went up Srairs , and I fetched them two Half-Gallons of Beer ; about half an Hour after Ten , or thereabouts , Mr Taylor was for going Home ; then it rained ; said Cavenagh , Pray do not go Home , Mr Taylor . Mr Taylor said , he must be up early in the Morning ; said Cavenagh . You may get up soon enough in the Morning if you stay here : Then he concluded to stay , and desired I would call him . I told him , I would if I could . Cavenagh had a Room for himself , and the other Prisoner , which he paid Half a Crown a Week for : Cavenagh , and that Woman Cordelia Taylor , went into their own Room , in order , as I supposed , to go to Bed ; Mr Cavenagh made a great Noise for a Candle , and said , he would have a Candle if he paid a Penny for it ; when Mr Taylor was in Bed , I went into his Room , took half his Candle , and gave it to Cavenagh ; then I went to Bed , and saw no more of the Prisoners from that Time to this . Q . Did you see Wm Taylor when he returned ? Baron . Yes ; - I believe it was about four o'Clock : - He had his Shoes and Stockings and Shirt on . - Nothing else . - When he knocked at the Door , I asked , who was there ? he said , For God 's sake let me in , I am robbed : When he came in , I said , How came you to be robbed ? said he , Lot Cavenagh and Dilly have robbed me . - Dilly , that is , Cordelia Taylor : I went up Stairs into their Room to see if they were there , for I did not know they were gone out : When I came into the Room , there was no Body there ; and I saw that they had not been in Bed at all , for the Bed was smooth , and not tumbled . - I helped to make it just before they came Home : I looked about for a Pair of Pistols , and a Hanger , that Cavenagh had , and they were all gone ; I saw the Hanger in the Kitchen about three o'Clock that Sunday in the Afternoon , and she carried it up Stairs ; as to the Pistols , I believe he had them in his Pocket : - My Master Gascoign lent Mr Taylor his Cloaths and a Wig and Hat to go Home in . Cor . Taylor . Did not Wm Taylor take a Lodging for me in Broad St Giles 's ? Baron . Never , that I know of . Q . Do you know that the Prisoner Taylor and the Witness ever liv 'd together as Man and Wife ? Baron . Not that I know of ; they are acquainted with one another , and I believe were great together , but did not live as Man and Wife ? Lot Cavenagh . Is Gascoign a married Man ? Baron . No , he is not . Lot Cavenagh . Does Mr Taylor owe Gascoign any Money for this Woman 's Maintenance ? Baron . I never knew that he did . Lot Cavenagh . Whose Child is that which is at Home ? Is it Gascoign 's or not ? Baron . No , it is not , it is my own ; I have a Husband , but he does not live with me . James Webster . Mr Taylor , the Prosecutor , hearing that Lot Cavenagh was on the other Side of the Water , informed me that he was robbed of his Cloaths in Hockley in the Hole , by Lot Cavenagh and Cordelia Taylor . I was waiting at the Bird-Cage in Southwark for Cavenagh , and saw him go by , and assisted in the taking of him ; he had a Pistol charged with Powder and Paper , but no Ball ; he had a Wig on , which Mr Taylor said he believed was his Wig . This is the Frock that Lot Cavenagh had on when he was taken . Alice Baron . I have seen this Frock several Times . This young Man , William Taylor , had it on that Sunday Night at our House , and a white Duffel Coat over it . Wm Taylor . I had this Frock on that Morning I was robbed . This is the Frock they took from me . - Robinson . To the best of my Knowledge , this is the Frock that was taken off Lot Cavenagh 's Back before the Justice . - Hammond . I saw this Coat upon Cavenagh 's Back once ; there was a Pistol taken out of his Pocket when he was taken ; there was Powder and Paper in the Pistol , but no Ball . This Hanger was taken out of Cordelia Taylor 's Lodging in Mint-Street in the Mint . Wm Taylor . She had a Hanger in her Hand when I was robbed , but I can not swear to this Hanger . Alice Baron . The Hanger Lot Cavenagh had at our House , was almost as big again as this , with a Buckshorn handle to it . George Holderness . I was present at the taking of Cavenagh : This Frock was taken from him ; this Wig I took off his Head ; he had a Pistol with him loaded . Wm Taylor . I can not swear to the Wig , but here is the Barber that made it . Lot Cavenagh . I know very well that I had both the Coat and the Wig from you . Cordelia Taylor . He was to give 3 l. 10 s. for them both . Lot Cavenagh . I had them of him for Money he owed me . Cordelia Taylor . These are all Thief-takers . Wm Palmer Hind . After we had taken Cavenagh , we went into Mint-Street , where the other Prisoner lodged , and broke open the Door , and there was this Woman fitting by the Fire , and this Hanger lay upon the Drawers . Lot Cavenagh . I desire to have my Lances and other Instruments again , that are used in Surgery . Cordelia Taylor . He took five Yards of Lace from me , and an Ell of Cambrick . - I do not know his Name , I only know him to be a Thief-taker . Hind . I have none of her Goods ; I never touched any Thing in the Room , but the Hanger and a Knife . Prisoners Defence . Cordelia Taylor . It it very hard that we should suffer upon the Account of this Coat that Taylor gave to Cavenagh ; we have Witnesses that will give a different Account of the Matter ; it is very improbable we should go to rob a Man that we were so intimate with , and who knew where to find us every Hour of the Day , and not murder him ; it is plain they only do this to take away our Lives for the Sake of the Reward . This Sunday , about Eleven o'Clock , Lot comes into the Room with this Frock , says I , Lord ! what has be paid you the old Score ? Yes , said he ; I might as well take this , as take nothing . Says I , I believe it will be a very dear Coat to you . We went out directly , and shut the Door ; this was at Gascoign 's . Then I went into Parker's-Lane , to one Mr Waper 's , who keeps a Chandler's-Shop , and asked them for a Lodging , but they had none ; we went over to the Golden-Hart Alehouse , and they had no Bed ; we staid there drinking till past Three , and went over to the Chandler's-Shop , and staid till near Five , and left the Coat there , which Cavenagh had given into my Hand , and went to another Place , and said to the Woman , will you let this Man and I lie down upon the Bed ? Accordingly we did lie down , and the Woman went out to work , and between Nine and Ten she came back , and we went to the Chandler's-Shop again , and then I gave the Coat to Lot Cavenagh . When Lot and you have come Home together , I have said , Billy , you bite your Lips upon the Account of Lot Cavenagh 's locking so hard at me . Do not you know Lot has came up when I have been in Bed , and I have asked him who should treat , he or I ? And sometimes one has treated , and sometimes the other has treated . You have oftentimes called me Bitch , as I have called you Names ; and you have told me I have done so and so with Lot ; you were as likely as ever Lot Cavenagh was , and I thought you as agreeable . Did not you give this Coat to Lot Cavenagh ? and now you say he took it from you against your will . You have said that Lot Cavenagh was a Fellow of so bad a Character , that if he was taken up for any Thing he would certainly be hanged . Did not you lay a Plot against him ? Gascoign was to be Thief-taker , and you were to be Prosecutor , and I was to swear a Robbery against Lot Cavenagh ; you know this to be true ; you have sworn several Robberies and Assaults against me : It the Man did but look at me you were jealous ; if I was absent but a Minute , you would say , what has Lot been bussing you ? What has Lot been kissing you ? You Bitch , where have you been ? & c. You have charged a Woman with robbing you of your Silver Buckles , when you have thrown them down the House of Office . Consider the Nights you and I have lain at Jack Gascoign 's : You have given me Reasons enough to be jealous of you , as I have given you to be jealous of me : I am a fine stout Woman to hold a Hanger in my Hand to kill a Man , especially as I have lain ten Months by your Side : O ! Billy , how can you be so base ? Court . Have you any Witnesses ? James Powell . I know Cordelia Taylor and the Prosecutor have lived together . Charles Rivington . About five or six Weeks ago , the Prosecutor and Jack Gascoign came to enquire for Little Dilly : says he , The Bitch has stript me last Night of all my Cloaths , and run away with them . - He said , G - d damn the Bitch , when I was in Bed and asleep , she * run away with all my Things . Said I to the Prosecutor and Gascoign , What do you mean by running away with them ? And this Gentleman , Wm Taylor , and Mr Gascoign did suppose , that when he was asleep , the little Bitch took his Cloaths and threw them out of Window : I believe she did rob him of his Cloaths , but not in the Manner he says . I come to do Justice ; I come without Fee or Reward . * When she was called up to Judgment , she said , The Truth was , that seeing the Prosecutor in Bed with another Woman , in Revenge she took away his Cloaths , and gave them afterwards to Cavenagh . George Waper . On the 23 d of September , one Sunday Night about the Hour of Twelve , Lot Cavenagh and that Woman ( the Prisoner ) I never saw her before then , came to my House and asked for a Lodging ; I told her I had none ; we went to the Golden-Hart Alehouse , over-against my House , and they had no Bed ; so we sat together till between 3 and 4 in the Morning , and then we went over to my House ; the Watch went 4 when they left my House : That Woman had a Bundle in a Bird's-eye Handkerchief , and left it there till they came again about Eight in the Morning : She opened the Handkerchief , and took out a Coat or a Frock , with Plate Buttons , and gave it to Cavenagh - I am a Glass-Grinder ; I live in Parker 's Lane ; my Wife keeps a Chandler's-Shop . Elizabeth Mac Guire . I live at Mr. Waper 's : Lot Cavenagh and Cordelia Taylor came into my Landlord 's about Twelve o'Clock on Sunday Night , the 23d of September . - I have a Note here which I marked for a Memorandum , because I paid some Money that Night : I can not read the Note . Q . Then you can not tell what Sunday , only that it was one Sunday . Mac Guire . Yes , I can ; it was Sunday the 23d of September , [ the 23d of September was Friday ] they asked for a Lodging , and my Landlord said , he had none : I went with my Landlord and his Wife , and the two Prisoners , to the Golden-Hart Alehouse ; I believe we had eight Pots of Beer there , and staid till past two o'Clock ; I went from thence to my Landlord 's House again , and there I sat till past Three ; that Woman had a Bird's-Eye Handkerchief , with something in it , and left it there , and staid till the Watch came Four , and then they went out ; and this Man and Woman came for the Handkerchief again , and she untied the Handkerchief , and I saw her give him a whitish Coat out of it , with Buttons that looked like Plate . Michael Mac Guire . I saw them there till Four o'Clock in the Morning . Daniel Maddox , and Anne Maddox , were called , but not examined , because they could only give an Account of what they heard from Gascoign , which was not spoke in the Presence of the Prosecutor . Court . When did you first see these People after this Robbery ? Wm Taylor . It was about three Weeks after they took the Things from me , that I saw him in the New Jail with the Coat on , but not the Wig on . Court . I ask you , whether or no , from the Time you lost the Cloaths , that you did not hear , before Cavenagh was taken , that he used to wear your Cloaths ? Wm Taylor . No , my Lord . Q . Did you ever see Cordelia Taylor after this Fact , at your Mother 's Back-door ? Wm Taylor . No ; I never saw them till they were taken up . Lot Cavenagh . It is a likely Thing I should rob this Person , when we were so intimate together , and should wear his Cloaths ! Cordelia Taylor . That Witness [ Maddox ] says , she and her Husband can save both our Lives , if they were to speak the Truth . Mary Shrub . I live within two or three Doors of Mr. Waper 's , and on Sunday the 23d of September , my Husband being out very late , I went there for some Small-Beer , and saw Cordelia Taylor there with a Bundle , but what was in it , I can not tell ; I remember it was the 23d of September , because my Sister was brought to Bed that Day . Thomas Boyd . I am a Marshal's-Court Officer : I have heard Mr Taylor the Prosecutor , very often say , that he was robbed in Mr Gascoign 's House , by that Creature Dilly , as they call her ; and they have been as intimate together as can be ; the next Day after Taylor was robbed , Alice told me , that Billy Taylor was robbed ; How ? said I ; said she , This Dilly and Lot Cavenagh went to Bed together , and Taylor and another Girl were together : and Dilly got into his Room , and took his Cloaths away ; and said she , They must get out at the Window ; she opened the Casement , and shewed me there was a little Piece of Brick broke out by the Window , and said , To be sure they must get out that Way , because the Doors were fastened ; it was the Fore-Room , up one Pair of Stairs , where Lot Cavenagh and Cordelia Taylor lay . Alice Baron is a comical Sort of a Bitch , for she has got a Husband , and does not live with him . Cordelia Taylor . I believe there is a Gentleman there , ( one of the Jury ) that has seen Wm Taylor and I together . Juryman . I have seen them several Times together ; he does not deny that himself . Elizabeth Green . - ( She was ordered to look for Wm Taylor , who stood just by her , but held his Hat a little before his Face ) I can not see him , though I know the young Man very well . - He is pitted with the Small-Pox . - He is a tall , thin Man . - He wears sometimes a light Wig , and sometimes a dark one . - This is the Man , I see him now : I saw him come into a House in Shorts-Gardens , where they sell Gin , and another Creature with him : The Woman of the House asked him , What he designed to do with little Dilly ? says he , I have nothing to do with her , only the Thief-takers will oblige me to it : Damn her says he , I do not design to do any Thing to her , but the Bitch was so wicked as to take my Coat off the Bed , and carry it to an Irish Fellow . Lot Cavenagh . He did owe me thirty-five Shillings , but we were so intimate , that I did not care what I did for him : but lately I did want to make it come to 40 s. that I might arrest him . Cordelia Taylor . Gascoign has said , there is Lot Cavenagh , he must be hanged , and we may as well get the Money as any Body else ; he may be a Stag for us , then he will bring in two or three more . Both Guilty . Death . 40 . + Jacob Cordosa was indicted , that he , with Jacob Globez , otherwise Lopez , did break and enter the Dwelling-house of Benjamin Sadler , in the Night time , and took from thence one Copper Warming-pan , one Copper Tea-kettle , one Copper Coffee-pot , one Quart Copper Pot , one Copper Money-shovel , two Box-irons , four Table-cloths , seven Napkins , and twenty-four Pewter Plates , the Goods of Benjamin Sadler ; and two Cambrick Aprons and two Cambrick Caps , the Property of Rebecca Burton , Sept. 30 . Benjamin Sadler . I live in Well-Close-Square : I can give no Account of my House being broke open , for I was sick then ; I can only say , that I lost the Things mentioned in the Indictment . - I had the Pewter Plates again , a Pair of Candlesticks , my Table-Linnen , and the Quart Pot . Rebecca Burton . I am Niece to Mr Sadler , and live with him . - When the House was broke open , I lost a Cambrick Apron , and a Cambrick Cap ; the Cap was left in a Pan upon the Dresser the Night before , and the next Morning , when I came down , was missing : I never had either the Apron or the Cap again . About six o'Clock in the Morning the Maid came up to me , and desired I would come down , for the House had been broke open . When I came down , I found the Staple of the Window forced out , the Casement was taken off , and put on the outside of the Window , the inside Shutters were open , and the Dresser-Drawers were open . - There were more Things lost than are laid in the Indictment . Capt . John Jell . I live in the Square , just by Mr Sadler 's , and had lain in the House about a Fortnight , because Mr Sadler had been sick , and if he had died , he had given me some Charge concerning it . On the 30th of September , or the 1st of October , when I came down in the Morning , I met this young Woman , Mrs Burton , and she said , We are robb 'd ! Said I , How so ? She said , Go into the Kitchen , and you will see - I usually took Care of the Fastenings my self , but I am not certain I did that Night : They had forced out a large Staple , and they had opened a flap Shutter , where there was a strong Chain ; when they came down the Flap , they came to a Glass Window , and there were two Panes of Glass taken out , by which they might open the Window ; the Case ment was taken off the Hooks , and sat down by the Side of the Window . - I my self have gone in there , as any Man almost may . These Gentlemen , who are the King 's Officers , saw the Prisoner with some of the Goods upon his Shoulder . Cordosa and Robinson were taken up about a Month afterwards by one Unwin ; it was on a Lord 's Day , between Eleven and Twelve , that I was charged with both of them by this Unwin the Thief-taker . I went to Justice Ricards , but he was not at Home then ; at six at Night I carried them before him . - The Thief-taker took this out of Cordosa 's Pocket before my Face . [ It was an Instrument crooked at the End like a Pick-Lock . ] Q . Where is Unwin ? Jell . He is ill of the Gout , and almost killed by some Rogues who beat him the other Day . Cordosa , on my first asking him , denied having any Knowledge of the Fact , but at last confessed ingenuously that he was guilty of stealing the Things out of this House : He produced none of them ; nor would he own how he took them . - He did not confess the breaking open the House . John Davis . I was going through Well-Close-Square the 1st of October , about three o'Clock in the Morning : I saw a Man with a Bag upon his Shoulder , and he , I suppose , imagining we were pursuing him , dropped the Bag off his Shoulder , and made off : I took the Bag up ; there was in the Bag two Dozen of Pewter Plates , and some Linnen . - I do not know that ever I saw the Prisoner before . John Dawson . I only saw his Back ; I can not say the Prisoner is the Man that dropped the Bag . On the 1st of October , at very near three in the Morning , I saw a Man walking down Well-Close-Square , with a Bag upon his Shoulder ; the Man seeing us , run away , and I run after him , and he dropped the Bag ; my Partner took hold of it , said he , we have got a Prize ; I believe it is a Bag of Tea . Guilty 39 s. 41 . + Joseph Isaacs , of St Mary , Whitechapel , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of Samuel Hawkins , in the Night , and taking from thence two wooden Boxes , three Dozen of Candles , three Pair of Shoes , one Pair of Boots , four Brass Candlesticks , one Pair of Brass Snuffers , one Brass Cock , and one Pair of Buckles , the Goods of Samuel Hawkins , October the 14th . Samuel Hawkins . I live in Lemon-street , in Goodman's-Fields ; when I came down Stairs on the 14th of October in the Morning , I found my Cellar-window broke open ; the Candles , and the other Things laid in the Indictment , were gone : I found my Boots in New Rag-Fair ; the Candlesticks , Snuffers , and a Box , were found , upon a Search-warrant , in Robinson 's House , by John Boyce . John Boyce . I know nothing of the Prisoner ; I never saw him in my Life : I found these Things at Robinson 's House . Mary Taylor . I looked after Mr Robinson 's Wife when she was ill : About the Middle of October , between One and Two in the Morning , I saw the Prisoner at the Bar come to Mr Robinson 's , and brought this Box in full of Candles , upon his Shoulder , and sat it down upon the Table : He said they had broke a House open . - I suppose he meant himself and Mr Robinson together : He came a great many Times : He brought the Candlesticks in his Handkerchief , and the Brass Cock in his Hand : I can swear to the Box and the Brass Cock : I know these to be the Candlesticks , because I saw them the next Morning . Samuel Hawkins . I take this to be my Box ; this Pair of Candlesticks , Snuffers , and this Cock , I can swear to . - Taylor . Robinson brought in the Candlesticks , and the Prisoner the Boots and Shoes . Prisoner . That young Woman is Robinson 's Cousin . Taylor . I am of small Kin to his Wife , but none to him .

Tryphena Eden . On the 15th of October last , my House was broke open . - I lost two Casks , containing eight Gallons of Rum , the Value is two Pounds , the one Cask of Brandy , Value three Pounds , one Stone Bottle with two Gallons of English Brandy , Value five Shillings , one Pewter Gallon Pot , Value five Shillings , and three Brass Cocks , Value three Shillings . They broke into the Vault in the Cellar ; I missed these Things on Saturday , about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon . - One of the Shutters was broke off , and one of the Bars bent in . - I believe they were shut fast on Friday Night ; but I saw them fast the Thursday before : There is an Iron Bar cross the Window , they took that off , and pulled the Pin out , and then there was room enough for a Man to go into the Cellar . I have not got any Thing again but the Gallon Pot , which I had of Mr Unwin ; he brought it to my House , and shewed it to me , and said , he took it out of Robinson 's House : I can not swear this is my Pot : I believe it is mine , because it was without a Lid . - Robinson said he had sold the Brandy and Rum to a Jew ; but I can not remember his Name . Joseph Isaacs * , a Jew . About eight or nine Weeks ago , I and John Robinson , and Jacob Cordosa , went into Well-Close Square , between One and Two in the Morning : Jacob Cordosa had an Iron Bar with him ; He put that Bar between the Bars of this Gentlewoman 's Cellar-door , bent one of the Bars back , put his Hand in , took out the Key , and then took the Pin out , and opened the Cellar-door ; Robinson and he went in , and I stood on the outside to watch if any Body went by . - We took away between seven and eight Gallons of Brandy in one Cask , between five and six Gallons of Rum in the other two Casks , one Stone Bottle with Brandy , but I can not tell how much ; and there was a Gallon Pewter-Pot without a Lid . - The Cocks were in the three Barrels ; they were carried to John Robinson 's House , and the Liquors were measured there , and they were all , except the Gallon Pot , sold to Isaac Fonseca , for three Pounds ; the Gallon Pot was left at Robinson 's House . - I do not know whose House it was that we robbed . * Isaacs and Robinson had given Information against each other , and Cordosa ; but being both indicted , the Court would admit neither of them to be an Evidence against Cordosa , on the first Trial . Isaacs being acquitted on the Indictment preferr 'd against him , was now produc 'd against them both . Hugh Lovejoy . I have known Robinson from a Child , and never heard any Ill of him before , and I hardly ever was a Month without hearing something of him . Ann Cooper . I have known him about three Years ; I live by his Parents , I never heard any Ill of him ; he never was taken up for any Crime before ; his Parents live in very good Credit . - His Father is a Tide-waiter .

I have have known him about seven Years , and never heard any Ill of him before . Capt . John Jell . I have known him from a little Child : I never heard any Ill of him in my Life , before I heard of his being charged with this Offence . Both Guilty . Death . 44 . + William Remue , of St John the Evangelist , was indicted , that he not having the Fear of God , & c. on the 17th of September , in the Sixteenth Year of his Majesty 's Reign , in and upon Mary Simmonds , Spinster , did feloniously make an Assault , and her , the said Mary , wickedly , unlawfully , and feloniously , carnally did know and abuse , against the Peace , & c. and against the Form of the Statute . Mary Simmonds . I am Servant to Mr Bodicoat ; my Mistress had been out of Town for two or three Days ; on the 17th of September , between Eleven and Twelve at Night , the Prisoner knocked at the Door ; I did not ask who was at the Door ; I opened the Door , thinking it was my Mistress ; but she did not come Home that Night , nor till eleven o'Clock next Day ; he asked me whether my Mistress was at Home ; I said No , and believed she would not come Home that Night . - My Master was in Bed suddled ; I was ironing , and thought to sit up all Night ; he came in and sat himself down by the Fire , and when I came to take an Iron out of the Fire , he put his Hand into my Bosom , and used me in a very rude Manner . I desired he would let me alone , and go Home to his Wife ; that I thought it much more proper for him and every Man to be at Home . - I knew him by his coming frequently to my Master 's and Mistress 's House . - Still he continued to use me very ill ; and at last laid me down on the Floor , and used me in a very violent Manner . Q . How did he use you ? Simmonds . He forced it into me , and if I had not cried out Murder , he would have drove it into the Soul of me . The Necessity of the Case requiring the Prisoner to be very explicit , she gave sufficient Evidence to maintain the Indictment . Q . How did you find yourself afterwards ? Simmonds . I found myself hurt in such a violent Manner , that I could hardly get to Bed : I was hardly able to wag . - I found myself very bad . Q . Was this done by Force , or did you give your Consent ? Simmonds . It was all Force , I gave no Consent at all . Q . When did you acquaint your Mistress with it ? Simmonds . I acquainted her with it about an Hour after she came Home the next Day . - The Prisoner went away between Twelve and One . Q . You say you were very bad , how long did you continue so ? Simmonds . About a Fortnight . Q . Did you complain to any Body ? Simmonds . To none but my Mistress . - Dr Mead , the Man Midwife , ordered me Medicines upon the Account of this Disorder . After the Prisoner had committed the Fact , he would have had me have promised to have gone with him , or to have met him at the Water-side , either the next Day in the Afternoon ( which was Saturday ) or Sunday in the Afternoon , or Monday in the Afternoon . - At Millbank ; but I did not go : I said to him , Mr Remue , What ! now you have got your Ends of me , you want to murder me . - I do really believe he had a Design to murder me . Court . Have you any Questions to ask her ? Prisoner . I have Council , and I beg that Gentleman may ask the Questions for me . Q . Do you know one Mr Debat ? Simmonds . Yes ; he used me very rudely the Thursday before . Q . Did you complain of what Mr Debat did to you ? Simmonds . No . Q . Did you complain of a Strain ? Simmonds . Yes , I did . Q. I ask you , if you were not brought to Bed of a dead Child a little before ? Simmonds . No . - I am very positive of it . - I never had one . Q . How came you to say Mr Debat used you ill ? Simmonds . Because he used me very rudely . Martha Roebank . I went to Mr Bodicoat 's on Saturday Night , the Day she came Home , for I heard that Mrs Boddicoat wanted to speak with me : When I came , she told me , the Girl was ill , and said , she had been ill used ; and desired me to go up Stairs ; that it was her Opinion , the Girl was ravished . I told her , it was my Opinion that the Girl had miscarried ; I nursed her ; the Medicines she had , were ordered by Dr Mead , a Man Midwife ; and Medicines I believe proper for such a Case . Q . How long was she bad ? Rocbank . I do not think she was very bad after the first Night . - I have been in private with the Prisoner and never saw any Harm by him . - I had Reasons to think it was a Miscarriage . - I am not a Maid , I have had five Children . I hope you will not ask me any Questions that immodest . I have nursed People before in there Cases , and I have been so myself ; and for that Reasons I believe it to be a Miscarriage . - I do not know what the Medicines were . Mrs Bodicoat . ( The Girl 's Mistress . ) I came Home on the Saturday in the Forenoon , and found the Girl in a very great Disorder . I asked her what was the Matter ; she told me , she believed she had over-reached herself ; but after some Time , she said , she had undergone a great deal of Fa since I had been gone . Then I asked her , if anybody had been there that had abused her ? I taxed her home whether she had not miscarried ; for I never saw any body in such a Condition , unless it was a Miscarriage . She said it was no such Thing I threatned to turn her out of Doors if she would not tell me ; then she said , Mr Debat had used her very ill the Thursday before ; it was a good while before she would tell that the Prisoner had lain with her ; but after I had pressed her very hard to tell me , she said , If I must tell you the Truth , it was Mr Remue . - I did not examine her so close as to know whether any Damage had been done to her Body . - She had been with me about two Months , but I have known her four Years , and never knew any Ill of her . - She is a giggling Girl ; I never saw any Immodesty by her in my Life - I never had a Miscarriage my self so I can not be so good a Judge as those that have . Isabella Walker . I never knew any thing of Dishonesty by her , and have known her from a Child down to this Time , and she always behaved me destly . Ursula Major . The young Woman was in at my House the Night before this Thing happened , and was as well as ever I saw her in my Life . The Prosecutrix sent a little Boy for me next Morning , after this Thing happened ; I found her very she told me her Mistress was not at Home , and desired me to get her something to do her good ; I told her I could not do her any good . Mrs Handford . I was sent for to Mary Simmonds . I am a married Woman , and have had three Children , so I know what Condition she was in : I found her in a very bad Way ; there was a Flooding by her Bed-side , and great Clods of Blood , which no body , but Women that have been married , can know any thing of . It is my Opinion , she had been ill used by some Man . - I never saw any Thing ill by the Girl in my Life . She has lived by me but a little while . - Her Mistress came Home about Eleven o'Clock on Saturday Morning , and asked me how she did ; I told her as I have related it . Mrs Handford cross-examin 'd . Q . You say you found her in a very bad Way , do you mean from the Effect of a Miscarriage , or from what ? Handford . No , I do not mean from a Miscarriage ; I know nothing of any Miscarriage ; I believe it was from being forced . Q . Might there not have been the same Consequences attending the lying with a Man , if it was done by Consent , as if it had been done by Force ? Handford . Indeed , Sir , I never had the Trial of that . Ursula Major . My Opinion is , that it was occasioned by Forcing ; for I never saw any ill of the Girl in my Life . Mr Remue 's Defence . My Lord , about the 18th or 19th of September last , the Prosecutrix was in a great Disorder , by the great Effusion of Blood . Here are two Persons who were sent for by the Prosecutrix , and they were the first Persons that examined her , and asked her the Occasion of the Disorder ; she said , she had over-strained herself by lifting an Ox 's Head . They told her they thought it incredible , that such a great Flow of Blood should come from a Strain ; and believed that she had miscarried , and very much pressed her to tell the Truth . She said she had not miscarried , and that no Man had ever lain with her . Mrs Handford and Mrs Sampson know this , and they said her Case was so bad , as to require the Opinion of a Man-Midwife : Accordingly they sent for Dr Mead , and he gave his Opinion , that she had miscarried . When she found they could not be persuaded to believe that it was a Strain , she acknowledged , that a Day or two before , James Debat , a Butcher , came into the House , tied down the Latch of the Door , pushed her into a Chair , and had to do with her , and broke the Chair in committing the Violence ; and Women , who are experienced in Child-bearing , say , that if there had been Violence committed , it is impossible that could be the Cause of such an Effusion of Blood . They told her they believed she had had a Child , and that she had secreted the Child , and believed the Child might be at seven or eight Months Growth . This Mrs Boddicoat and others have consulted how to fix it upon me , because I had been pretty much backward and forward in the House , and in order , as I believe , to extort some Money from me . They sent for Dr Mead ; when they told him of it , he said it proceeded from a Miscarriage : When they talked to him of the Prosecution , he said it would be a most enormous Case and a Sin , and the Indictment must of Consequence fall to the Ground . They said , we shall never be able to make our selves Satisfaction , without commencing a Suit against him ; and so these People swore against me , and indictment me here . I beg Leave to observe another Thing ; they have made Overtures from Time to Time , that if I would give them any Thing for Satisfaction , as they pretended , for their Charge and Trouble , the Prosecution should be stifled ; and Martha Roebank said , they would take five Guineas , of which Mrs Boddicoat was to have one Guinea , and the Girl four ; and on Sunday Night they sent Mr Barnes to Mrs handford , and told her Mrs Boddicoat was miserable poor , and that they wanted something to support themselves , and if I would give four or five Guineas , there should be no Prosecution . Lody Handford . I was desired to go to Mrs Boddicoat 's , and I went there ; I was the first Person that took this Creature 's Information with Relation to the Affair ; said I , Mary , what is the Matter with you ? She said , I have lifted an Ox 's Head , and have done my self a great deal of Damage ; but I believe it was a Miscarriage ; I have had a Miscarriage my self : This Flowing was in such a Quantity , that no body , unless it was a Woman that miscarried , or was delivered of a Child , could have so much . I was a Maid once , and was married pretty soon , about Fourteen Years of Age , and I never knew the like , but in these Cases . Molly , said I , How can this be ? I am sure you have known a Man for it is a Thing quite contrary to Nature , without you have known Man ; and I am afraid there is a Murder at the Bottom . - This was the next Day , between Nine and Ten o'Clock , on Saturday Morning ; she said , as God should judge her , she never knew any Man in her Life : Said I , Hussey , you are a Liar ; and I told her , my Lord , it could not be so with her without a Child or a Miscarriage , and I believe a very large Miscarriage : She would not own any Thing with respect to the Prisoner at the Bar for a good while : She said one Debat , a Butcher , had to do with her one Afternoon ; that he pushed her into the Parlour , tied down the Latch of the Door , and broke a Chair in the doing it : I still persisted in it that it was a Miscarriage . Well , said she , if you must have the Truth , I will tell you ; it was Debat ; and to tell you the Truth , he has been great with me ever since I came into the House . Her Mistress said , I always told you , Debat was an impudent Fellow . I will speak the Truth for I think it is a Pity an innocent Man should suffer ; when Dr Mead came into the Room , he said , there was either a Child , or a very large Miscarriage , and after she had abided by this a long Time , that it was Debat , she said , If you must know the Truth , it was Mr Remue . Mr Remue is a very modest Man : I have a Child here in Court , that I have trusted with him all Parts of the Day , and he never offered any Thing amiss to her in his Life . Q . Were there any Offers made of taking Money ? Handford . Yes . - By Mrs Boddicoat and the Prosecutrix ; the Prosecutrix said , if he would give her some Money , she would not appear against him ; and I said , The Man will not give you a Shilling : I believe Mrs Boddicoat would have been willing to have taken what she was out of Pocket ; I have heard her say , she would take ten Guineas , and not trouble herself about it . Q . Now as you have had a Miscarriage , do you take this to be the Effect of a Miscarriage ? Handford . I really do believe it to be so . Elizabeth Sampson . I went to see Mrs Boddicoat 's Maid ; she was in Bed , and I found her a great deal worse than I thought she was ; she had concealed a great deal of Blood , her Camblet Gown and Petticoat were spread over the Floor to conceal it ; said I , Mary , what is the Matter with your Arm it is so bloody : Says she , I am all over so , I have hurt myself in lifting an Ox 's Head . Said I , If you had lifted a whole Bullock , you could not be worse . I turned down the Bed , and that was in a bad Condition ; I thought she had been delivered of a Child . I looked all over the Room , into the Cradle and Trunk , and every where , to see if there was a Child concealed . I charged her with making away with the Child , and she protested with a great many Vows , she did not know what a Man was , before the Midwife examined her ; then she said , one Debat had forced her into a Room , and fastened the Latch down , & c. They charged her with having a Child , which she denied ; but she said , if she must tell the Truth , Mr Debat had to co with her ever since she came to Mrs Boddicoat 's ; she said so for a great many Hours , and then she said it was Mr Remue ; and Mrs Boddicoat said , if he would give the Girl fifty Pounds , and give her ten Pounds for spoiling the Bed , she would say no more of it . Court . Who proposed to take the Money ? Sampson . I had it from the Mouth of her Mistress ; she said the Girl would not make it up under fifty Pounds . Q . What do you take this to be the Effect of ? Sampson . I take it to be the Effect of a Miscarriage ; but I never was in the Time of Child-Birth , in so bad a Condition as she was in . Dr Mead . On the Saturday , about eleven o'Clock , I went to Mrs Boddicoat 's to see the Maid ; when I came into the Room , I declared my Opinion , that there had been a Child , or a large Miscarriage ; there was a great flooding , and all the Symptoms that could be of it ; the Girl protested she had never known Man . I told her , that her Word would signify nothing , there were such Symptoms to the contrary ; at length she said one Debat had to do with her ; the Bed was so wet with Blood and Water that flows at these Times ; there are very few Names for Smells , but there is a very indifferent Smell attending these Cases ; there were Cloaths bloody , and Blood in a great Quantity about the Room ; it is my positive Opinion , that there was a Child , and that it must be at least seven Months Growth . Q . Was there any external Appearance besides Blood and Water ? Dr Mead . No , there was not : I passed my Hand into her Body , and there was nothing unusual . Q . Has not the Forcing a Woman such an Effect ? Dr Mead . Not to the fiftieth Part of what was in this Case . Q . Was there not a Talk of the Prosecution being stopped , if they could have got a Sum of Money . Dr Mead . Yes , there was a Talk of fifty Pound . - And something intimated , that if they could get it , it would be the Way for me to be paid , but I never had a Fathing . - I have followed this Business about thirteen Years . Q. I think you said you searched her Body ? Dr Mead . I did so . - She had Clods of Blood in her Shift , she was bloody from the Fingers End to the Elbow , and over the Mons Veneris . - They wanted me to give a Memorandum , or Note under my Hand , that the Girl was in Danger of her Life : Said I , I will not do any such Thing for an hundred Guineas ; they said , Do you think the Girl is able to go abroad ? No , said I , And I will give you any Thing under my Hand , that she is not able to go abroad . - But they took her abroad in a Day or two for all they desired that : I really believe it to be an iniquitous Affair . Mrs Hoare . I have been acquainted with Mr Remue , about a Year and a half , his Wife is a particular Acquaintance of mine ; he has waited for her several Hours , and I never saw any Thing but what was very modest by him , nor ever heard any thing of this Nature before . Frances Pooley . I have known Mr Remue seven Years ; he lodged with me several Times , and always behaved civilly ; I have a Girl about fifteen Years of Age , who has frequently sat with him when I have been out , and he never behaved amiss to her . Miss Handford . I have known Mr Remue about three Years . I have been frequently with him a great while together , Morning and Evening , when Nobody has been in the House but him and me , and I never knew him behave amiss , and never heard him talk unhandsomely . - Wilcox . I was sent for to the Prosecutrix ; I examined her , and found her in a very great Disorder , and that she had either had a Child , or a Miscarriage . I have followed Midwisry four Years , and do not think there could be any Thing like it , if there had not been a Child , or a Miscarriage . Miss Pooley . I am about Fourteen Years of Age . I have been frequently with Mr Remue , within these two Years ; I have been with him by my self , and he never offered any Thing rude to me . Elizabeth Keate . I have known him about three Months ; he sometimes spent an Evening at our House , and I never knew him behave amiss . Mrs Boddicoat called again . Court . Here have been some Witnesses that mention 'd Sums of Money being demanded by you ; I ask you , whether you ever demanded any Money or not ? Boddicoat . That Saturday Morning , Mr Remue wanted to speak with that Gentlewoman , and asked how the Maid did ? Says she , had enough , Mr Remue ; there is but a Span between her and Death : He desired proper Care might be taken of her , and it should be paid for : and that is a very reasonable Thing . Q . Some of the Witnesses spoke as to the requiring of Money relating to the Prosecution , was there any Thing said about that ? Boddicoat . I did say , I had not Money to go on with the Prosecution , and the Girl had none , and I was willing to right her if it lay in my Power . Acquitted . 45. John MacCullough , of St Clement Danes , was indicted for stealing a Loin of Pork , Value 3 s. the Goods of Wm Taylor , October 27 . Nicholas Gandy . Last Saturday , a little Girl told me , a Man had run away with my Loin of Pork ; a Butcher told me , he went through Clements-Inn , so I followed him , and took it under his Arm ; says I , You Villain , what do rob the Spital ; he began to damn his Eyes in a sad Manner ; when he was before the Justice , a Man said he belonged to a Gang ; he was asked whether he was concerned in the Murder of the Man in Chelsea-Fields ; he said he was not , but he supped with them the next Night that were . - I was going through Clements-Inn , and hearing a Cry of Stop Thief , I saw this Fellow jump down all the Steps at once , I caught him fast in my Arms ; then the Prosecutor came up and took him .

I charged her with them , and she stood very stiff in it that she had them not .

I had a Search-Warrant brought me to search the House of one Morgan , and found but a Trifle there ; when I served the Body Warrant on her , she slipped two Half-Guineas into my Hand , and begged I would let her go ; I believe she put them into my Hand above twenty Times ; I told her , if she would give me as many Guineas as there were Days in the Year , I would not take it .
