Daniel Flannigal . On Sunday , the 5th of June , as I was coming down Holborn-Bridge , I met a young Woman , who took me to Mrs Ballard 's House ; we went up one Pair of Stairs , and the young Woman called for some Liquor , which I suppose to be Gin ; they had it and drank it , I never tasted it : I gave them Two-pence half-penny for it , they said it was not enough , so I gave them another Half-penny , and was for going away ; says Ballard . You must not go till you make us a Present of something else , and I said , I would not give them any thing else , and I would go about my Business .

Q . Was Ballard one of them ? Flannigal . I can not positively swear , that Mary Ballard was one that assaulted me , but she must be one concerned , because she was the Person I had my Things from again ; the Watchman broke the Door open , and as soon as she found he was coming . she hid herself in a little turn-up Bed , that was in the lower Room - she got in between the Head of the Bed and the Wall ; the Constable took her out from thence ; after I got to the Watch-house , I said , if you will let me have my Things I will let you go ; Mary Ballard made Answer , and said , if the Constable would let her go back again , very likely she might find them ; and the Constable told her he would let her go back again ; and accordingly she went back , and they found them . - The Watchman said he found them in the Bed , where she hid them . Q . Who was it delivered the Things into your Possession ? Flannigal . The Constable has had them all this Time , till now . Q . Was it the Constable or a Watchman that went with her back ? Flannigal . It was the Watchmen ; one of the Watchmen delivered them to the Constable , and the Constable has kept them till now . Q . Was Elizabeth Harris there ? Flannigal . I am sure Elizabeth Harris was there ; and to the best of my Knowledge , she was the chief Person that stopped my Breath . - I was astonished ; I was out of my Senses ; they laid upon my Stomach , and stopped my Breath , so that I could fearce breathe - I can not say whether Harris did it or no , but she was the first Person that threw me down upon the Bed , and lay upon my Breast .

Philip Price . A little before 11 o'Clock , at Night , on Sunday the 5th of June , I heard there was a Disturbance at a House in Thatched-Alley in Chick-Lane , I went down and beat pretty hard with my Staff at the Door , and bid them open the Door , but they would not come down to open it ; at last , I saw a Way to put my Hand in , which I did , and shoved the Bolt back ; then there was another Door at the Stairs-Feet , that went into a Room , and I set my Back against it , and burst it open , and went up Stairs ; there was a Woman with a Poker in her Hand , and she got away presently ; and there was one got away over the Houses ; I came down Stairs again , and searched this lower Room , and found Ballard behind the Bed , and Harris in the Closet ; and then the Prosecutor said , that Harris lay upon him , and stopped his Breath ; then I went with them both to the Watch-house ; and Ballard said , if there were any such Things lost in her House , she believed , if they would let her go , she might find them ; accordingly I went back with her into this lower Room , where the Bedstead was turned up , which she stood behind , and she pulled the Bedstead down again , and there were the Buckles and the Cross lying upon the Bed ; says she , they are ; and I brought them , and delivered them into the Consta ble 's Hands ; Ballard said she knew nothing of them .

Q . Did Ballard say , that she was , or was not concerned in the Robbery ? Bothomly . She said , she was not concerned ; but if she was not , what Occasion had she to hide herself . Ballard . One of the other Watchmen found the Things upon the Bed . Price . When she pulled the Bedstead down the Bed tumbled down , and there they lay - she did not take them up ; she said , here they are . Harris . I was a little in Liquor , it being Sunday Night ; and my Husband beat me , and cut my Mouth , and made me in a Gore-Blood ; and I went into the Closet to hide myself , and Ballard said , stay there , and he shall not hurt you . Ballard . I was very ill , and had taken a Sweat , and I laid myself down upon the Bed - though the Bed turns up , there is room for any Body to lie behind it . Henry Turner .

I know nothing farther of the Prisoner than his coming to the Poultry Compter to see some of those who are under Consinement there ; he came with this Parcel of Things , and there happened to be a Mob at the Gate , which he imagined were coming after him , so he threw them into the Turnkey 's Habitation ; and I desired him not to let the Boy have them . for I thought he was not a Person likely to have such Things of his own , so I sent for a Constable and charged him , and I found that this Parcel belongs to a poor Miller in the Country , who has not a Farthing of Money to carry on the Prosecution ; and before he could raise the Money to prosecute the Boy , the Goods must be lost . Prisoner . They bid me bring the Things into the Lodge . Q . How came you to ask the Boy to bring the Things up to the Lodge ? Kingston . He is a loose Boy that comes after the Thieves , he brought them in , and being a little surprised , he threw them into the Lodge ; so I told Mr Cox it was proper to stop the Things and the Boy too , till we could come at a little better Knowledge of the Affair , and in about a Quarter of an Hour 's Time he confessed that he took them out of the Boat , and brought them away clandeslinely ; they were taken out of a little one Mast Boat , and he said no Body was on board the Boat when he took them - I am an Under-Turnkey , my Business is to look after the Rats and Mice . Cox . When the Person who was the Carrier of the Goods came to him , he said the Prisoner went into the Boat with an Excuse to help a Man to gather up some Wheat , for he had burst a Sack , and the Man who was to carry the Goods , took him to be the other Man 's Boy , and had no Mistrust of his being a Thief .

she said , it was no Matter to me . for they were her Goods : I told her I would see what they were ; then , she said , if I would see what they were , I must go with her where she was going , and I should see there ; I told her , I would go no farther , but would see them : I held her fast , and put one Hand into her Apron ; and the first Thing I saw was one of my own Gowns ( there was a large Parcel of Goods produced , as in the Indictment . which were sworn to by Mrs Wheeler ) the next Thing I saw was my Husband 's Shag Breeches , with the Knee-Buckle in them , the Fellow of which I had then in my Shoe , and have now ; when I saw them , I made no farther doubt but they were all mine ; I still held her , and cried I was robbed and desired the Neighbours to send for a Constable : she desired that I would not put her into the Hands of a Constable , or a Publican , and she would return me my Goods ; I own , says she , I have done an ill Thing to you ; but if you will let me go about my Business , and not put me into the Hands of any Body - if you will not put me into the Hands of any Body , and not expose me , I will give you your Goods and your Money ; the first Time she only said she would give me my Goods ; I did not know that she had got any Money ; because I did not recollect , that there was any Silver among the Cloaths ; and I was frightened for fear she should have got to my other Money ; and then , I was willing to withdraw from the Folk , which I had called to my Assistance , to get her into the Apartment again , from which she had taken the Things , thinking she would return me the Money ; and believing that she had got a large Sum ; I took her into the Entry she came out of , and shut to the Door to keep the Mob out ; she then threw down the Cloaths , and put her Hand in her Pocket and pulled out the Money , and gave it me ; when I found it was only the Silver that was in the Cloaths ; I threw it down ; for I was very glad she had not got to the other Money ) and then I went to open the Door , to let in the People I had called to my Assistance ; she then went to hold me , to prevent me from opening the Door of the Entry ; I pushed her from me , to let the People in , that the Thief might go to Newgate ; but , I was not willing she should go , till I saw whether she had got my other Money ; for she might have spent my Money in Newgate ; and , if I had sent her there , she would not have delivered me the Money ; and I could not swear to the current Coin . - The Reason of my opening the Door , was to have the Prisoner secured ; for I could not have kept her long , if I had not had Assistance : when I opened the Door , some of the Neighbours came in , and desired the Door might be shut again , to keep the Mob from running away with the Things ; they bid me take my Cloaths off the Ground , and tie them up , and see what Money there was , which I did , and there was four Shillings ; said I , to the Prisoner , there was more Money than this ; she said , she had two Shillings when she came in , and if she had more than that , it was my own ; she put her Hand in her Pocket , pulled out four Shillings , and put two of them into my Hand , which made six Shillings , and said she had no more , then she begged and prayed for Mercy , and that she might : have Leave to run away , but I thought it was not safe for me to let her ; so she was secured , and carried before Justice Deveil ; one Thing I forgot , that when the Neighbours first came in , they heard her throw down a Key , and I made her take up the Key , and give it me ; and they desired me to go up , and see whether that Key opened my Door ; and that Key locked and unlocked my Door , which was then open , and my Drawers swept of all that was in them ; I desired she might be searched , and there were 8 Keys more found upon her ; there was a Street-Door Key , Keys for Chamber-Doors , and other Keys . Prisoner . I have no Council to plead for me ; I was disappointed * in that ; I keep a Milliner's-Shop in Convent Garden ; I never went by the Name of Smith in my Life ; my Name is unhappily Yates or Holmes . * The Law allows not the Assistance of Counsel , as to matter of Fact , on any Indictments for Felony , yet , it is the Opinion of many , it would be never the worse , if it did ; for , it seems very strange , to allow a Man this Assistance , in Defence of his Property , and deny it to him , when his Life lies at Stake . See Preface to the Collection of State Trials , 6 Vol . Fol . and Whitelocke 's Memorials , p. 433 . * Wheeler . Col. Deveil called her by the Name of Smith , as soon as she went in . Q . Had she any Bundle when she went into the House ? Wheeler . She had no Appearance of a Bundle ; I am sure she is the very same Person . Thomas Norman . I keep a Publick-House in Oxford Market ; as I was at my Door , I heard somebody call Mr Norman ; I turned about , and saw Mrs Wheeler have the Prisoner hold by the Petticoat , and was bringing her along ; and desired me to come to her Assistance ; and , in the mean Time , took the Prisoner over to her own House ; and then I went into my own House again , and sent my Wife ; and when I came , the Door was bolted , or latched ; I stood a Minute or two , and the Door was opened ; there was a Parcel of Linnen lying upon the Floor ; I can swear to some of them . Mrs Wheeler was making a great Noise , and said , she was robbed of all she had : There were four Shillings and some Half-pence lying on the Floor ; the Prisoner pulled four Shillings out of her Pocket , and gave Mrs Wheeler two ; and said , the other two were her 's ; she began to cry , and begg 'd for God 's Sake , that she would let her go about her Business ; for she was a poor unfortunate Woman , and did it to support a young Child , which she had . Prisoner . About six Weeks ago , Mrs Smith came to my Shop to speak to me ( she owed me 16 s. 6 d. ) and desired I would go along with her to see some Lodgings ; I told her I could not go ; then she came another Time ; I told her I was going to leave my House , and take a first Floor ; she said she had taken a pretty Place , and desired I would go and see it ; this was on Saturday Se'nnight , but I could not go , and on Monday I went to Ratcliff Cross : On Tuesday I saw Mrs Smith again , I told her . I I could not go then , for I must go to the Boarding-School in Cavendish Square ; but I would go on Wednesday , and accordingly I did go with her , and as I came down . Oxford Square , says she . Come up Stairs , did not I tell you I had a pretty Apartment ; I must move before Quarter Day , and I desire you would see whether there are any Bugs in the Walls , for I had a Receipt from abroad to kill Bags , and had no Occasion to take her Things . She went up one Pair of Stairs higher , and asked if one Mr Johnson was within , a Child answered , and said no ; she had a Bundle of Cloath pined up , and she gave them to me to carry for her , and she gave me the Money ; I had not got three Yards from the Door before Mrs Wheeler said , G - d d - n you for a B - h , you have robbed me ; I said , Madam , I have not ; ( for no Body could see what I had ) I was afraid of her , for I found her to be a very violent spirited Woman , she said little to me , but she called me all the B - es she could think of ; one of the Gentlemen of the Jury told me she was a vile Woman , and would swear any thing , and if your Lordship will inquire into her Character , you will find her to be so * . * This comes with a very ill Grace from the Prisoner , whose Life is probably owing to the Compassion of the Prosecutrix : For had this Felony been laid to have been committed ( as the Fact was ) in a Dwelling-House , it had been a capital Offence . Michael Kitchen . Last Sunday Mrs Wheeler came to the Prisoner , and fell a swearing and cursing , and said , if there was never another Woman in the World she would hang her , and that if she had an hundred Sisters she would hang them all if they were guilty of such a Thing ; she was swearing and cursing all the while she was there ; she was ready to tear a Man to Pieces for speaking to the Prisoner ; the Prisoner fell in a Fit - This is Mrs Wheeler , she has got a black Eye now , but she had none then . Prisoner . Mr Thredgold is Landlord of the House , and was in Newgate last Sunday with the Prosecutrix . Mr Thredgold ( sworn ) . I never saw the Prisoner , from the Time she was put into the Coach , when she was taken , till the Time she came to this Bar - I am Landlord of the House . Prisoner . You were in Newgate with the Prosecutrix and 3 other Persons on Sunday - I do not mistake the Person . Thredgold . What Time was I there ? Prisoner . About 5 or 6 o'Clock . Thredgold . I was at Marybon Church at that Time [ This was confirmed by another Gentleman of the Jury ] . Thredgold . What Cloaths had that Person on ? Prisoner . He was in blue grey . Thredgold . I have no such Cloaths . The Foreman . I have known Mr Thredgold these 20 Years , and I never saw him in such a Suit . Prisoner . His Cloaths were a light blue grey - If I am mistaken in the Gentleman 's Face , I ask his Pardon . Elizabeth Coxon . I have known the Prisoner about 4 Years ; I have nursed three Children for her ; this is the third , and I never heard any ill of her . Q . Did you Never hear any Ill of her ? Coxon . No ; not from any Person of Credit . John Harrod . I have known the Prisoner about 3 Years , she used to buy Goods of me - I am what we call a Higgler ; she used to buy Butter and Eggs , Fowls , Geese , and Piogeons , a , and always used to pay me very well ; I never heard any Harm of her , she always lived in good Lodgings , and always lived in Credit wherever ; she lived ; she has come several Times to see me ; I have nothing locked up , every thing lies at Rack and Manger , and I never missed any thing .

The 28th of May , between 12 and 1 , I was coming down Turnmill-Street with a Bundle in my Hand ; I set it down upon a Bulk to pin my Gloves , and before I had done that my Bundle was gone ; there were several People sitting at the Door I thought it had been an empty House at first , but afterwards I found the Prisoner lived there ; I followed him , and said , you have got my Bundle ; says he , No 1 , no 1 , that is what he said , he could say nothing else ; he went into the House , and came out again ; I called for a Constable , and said this Man has robbed me of my Bundle , and I cried out Stop Thief , but I could not run so fast as he , so another Man stopped him 'till I came up to him . He said to the Man that stopped him , that I had abus 'd him ; and he was going for a Warrant for me ; but he told me , if my Bundle was there I should have it : When I came back the Door was locked , and the People that were sitting found it were gone ; but the Key was handed out to us , and we were let in . He had a Wife lying in , she fell a crying , and said , she knew nothing of it , and said the Prisoner was her Husband ; I said if he would give me my Bundle I would go away , and have nothing farther to do about it . - I never had my Bundle since . Levinus Vandervan . I was drinking at the Hercules Pillars , and this Gentlewoman came crying out Stop Theif ; I ran after the Prisoner , and said , you are the Man that has robbed a Gentlewoman . D - n the B - h , says he , she has been abusing me , and I will get a Warrant for her ; and desired that I would let him go , and he said , G - d d - n you . I will cut you across the Face with a Candlestick , which he had in his Hand , and said he would knock me down with it ; and when the Gentlewoman came up , she charged him with the Robbery , and he said if they were at his House she should have them again . James Ford . I am about 17 Years of Age , the Prisoner is the Person who really took the Bundle , I saw him take it ; I saw him slide it off the Bulk , and go in Doors with it . Prisoner . I was standing at my House in Turnmill street . I never saw the Bundle , nor never saw the Gentlewoman before in my Life . John Jones . I have known the Prisoner ever since February was Twelve Months , and never saw any Thing by him , but what was just and honest . Elizabeth Baily .

Margaret Lucas . I have known him these four Years ; he was a Covenant-Servant with me two Years ; he behaved very honestly with me ; I never heard any Harm of him before . Giles Baily .

Francis Palmer . I live in Chick Lane , and am a Constable ; on the second of this Month I was going my Rounds , about two o'Clock in the Morning . I went down Black Boy-Alley , and met one Sarah Laycock , says she , Master , wo n't you give me a Dram ; said I , Sarah , there 's no body up . . Was any of the Watchmen going the Rounds with you ? Palmer . No body was going with me at that Time ; I had left the Watchmen at their Stand : Oh ! says Sarah Laycock , I will warrant you I will find a Man up ; so I went with her to a Place they call Little Charles 's , and presently Moll Rosum comes in , says she , Master , wo n't you give me a Dram ? Q How long had you been there before she came in ? Palmer . She came in , in less Time than I have been speaking about it ; Said I , Polly , what do you do here ; I put my Hand in my Pocket , and gave them Six-pence to drink among them . and came away , I did not stay at all ; and as I was coming back again , this Moll Rosum followed me , as far as my own Door ( for I was going to unlock my Door to see whether all was safe , ) she came up to me and said , Well , I thank you , my Dear , God bless your Cock , or something to that Purpose : She clapp 'd her Hand to my Breeches , and went away directly . I did not miss my Watch at that Time , but about a Quarter of an Hour afterwards I felt for it , and it was gone ; then I suspected that she had it , as nobody had been near me but her : Away I went down again to Little Charles 's to look for her , and there was Sarah Laycock , says I , Sarah , Moll Rosum has got my Watch ; and she said she would find her , but I did not find Poll till Ten o'Clock that Morning . I found her at the Three Tuns , hollowing , and making a Noise in her drunken Airs ; I brought her down to Little Charles 's , but could not make her own it ; and some of the same Sortment that were there said , D - n you , you old where , are you not ashamed to serve my Master so , if you do not give him his Watch , I 'll do you a Mischief . The Prisoner was pleased to use a great deal of scurrilous Language ; Says she , Is that your Watch ? D - n you , you Dog , do you know your Watch ? Then she put her Hand into her Bosom , and pulled out a Seal and Ribbon ; said she , Do you you know that , if you do not know your Watch ? and I said yes , I could swear to it ; I could to the Seal , if I could not to the Ribbon : Come , says she , if you will give me a Quartern , I will give you your Watch ; so I was forced to comply , and I gave her 7 or 8 Quarterns , but could not get it ; now , says she , your Watch is pawned for 15 s. and if you will give me 16 s. and 6 d. I will fetch it out of Pawn ; so I gave her 16 s. and 6 d. and followed her to the Bull and Butcher at Cow-Cross , and then to the Boar 's Head Tavern , and said , Now , Poll , let me have the Watch ; and she laid the Watch down on the Table , and I took it up ; she said , You son of a B - h , there 's your Watch , you shall be one Pint of Wine and I will be another , and we will drink together ; and we drank 3 Pints of Wine together - she laid the Watch down on the Table at the Boar 's Head Tavern in Smithfield , and insisted on a Pint of Wine ; and after I had taken it up , she said , Now you have got your Watch , you shall see I do not mind a Pint of Wine any more than you do , I will be a Pint with you ; She had a pretty deal of Money in her Pocket then ; I believe she deceived me in the pawning of the Watch . Prisoner . Mr Palmer , where was you 2 or 3 Times along with me before that ? Palmer . No where . Prisoner . Did not you send Mary Ballard * for a laced Mob for me at 10 o'Clock one Night ? Where did I set down by the Bed side with you , and you lent me Money to buy earthen Ware ? * See No 303 . P. 187 . Palmer . I will explain that a little : About 2 or 3 Months ago , I was going my Rounds , and met her , says she , Master , wo n't you give me a Dram ? ( she was very drunk ) says I , you are too old to be a Whore now ; there is no Body will have any thing to do with you , it is Time to leave it off now , and if you do n't you will go to Hell into the Bargain . - She said if she could get half a Crown she would leave it off ; that she had not half a Crown in the World ; said I , it is hard that all you have in the World is not worth half a Crown ; if I thought it would do you good , I would not value half a Crown , and I bid the Woman at the Chandler 's Shop give her 2 s. and 6 d. and I would give it her again ; said I , perhaps 5 Shillings will do you more Good , and the Woman gave her 5 Shillings by my Order : Poll , is not this Truth ? [ The Prisoner did not deny it ] Prisoner . You were upon the Bed with me when you missed your Watch , when you kissed me and hugged me , and called me , My Dear : Did not you find your Watch again your own self ; I did not think you would expose yourself after this Rate . Palmer . After a Month 's Imprisonment , and starving alive , I should have thought you would have talked in another Manner ; I submit it to the Court , whether they think I would have to do with such a Creature , as that , when there are fine Girls enough to be had - I thought , as I was Constable , I was very safe ; I was not afraid ; I thought they would not offer to rob me . William Peck I had a Warrant brought to me , to serve upon the Prisoner ; and when I took her she owned she took the Watch ; and she said , if she died , it was for the Man that she loved ; this is the Watch that was delivered to me . Prisoner . Ask Mr Peck how he came by that Watch ? Peck . It was given to me at Justice Poulson 's , the 4th of this Month . Prisoner . Mr Palmer , let me see whether that is the Watch , or no . Edward Chapman . The Prisoner said at the Tavern , that she picked the Watch out of Mr Palmer 's Pocket . Prisoner . I never saw it with my Eyes before . Chapman . She was there , and drank part of two or three Pints of Wine , and delivered the Watch to Mr Palmer . Prisoner . I have been guilty of no Misdemeanour , but what I did in private to pleasure my Master . Mr Palmer knows I am trusted by the Heads of the Parish , and never wronged any Body . Guilty of the Felony only . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 322.

It may be the first Fact . Elizabeth Clay .

I know nothing of the Prisoners ; there was one Sarah Green concerned , that my Wife bought the Boiler of ; she was before the Justice ; Harris the Thief-taker and another had the Charge of her , and they let her go . Ann Rowe . This Sarah Green lives in Rosemary-Lane ; I went to her , in order to buy a Pot , and she gave 8 s. to get it out of pawn ; I gave her 6 d. Earnest , and was to give 12 s. for it ; when I came to examine it I found it to be my own Pot . Charles Butler . I live in the New-Change in Rag-Fair ; on the 30th of May , I got up between three and four in the Morning , and saw the three Prisoners bringing this Pot to Sarah Green 's Door ; they went by Nick-Names then ; one was called Doctor , another Blueskin , and the other Cock-Eye : I stepped over to them ; says Hudson , we have been moving Mrs Green 's Goods , and as you are a Bricklayer , if you can get her a Chap for this Pot she will be obliged to you ; I asked the Price , and he said 17 s. said I 17 s. is too dear ; on Thursday sen'night , I went to Mr Rowe 's , and Mrs Rowe said , she wished they were hanged that had stole her Copper ; and wanted to buy one ; I told her I had seen such a Thing , which is to be sold ; I went with Mrs Rowe to Mrs Green 's , and asked her if she had such a Thing to dispose of ? yes , said she , I have ; she took 8 s. to the Pawnbroker 's , and fetched it out , and paid 2 d. for the Use ; Mrs Rowe , as she was founding it , said , this is my Kettle , it cost me a Golden Guinea ; they agreed for 12 s. and my Mistress gave 6 d. Earnest : I went to Justice Jones , and got a Warrant against the Prisoners , and against Sarah Green ; she was charged with an Officer , and it is thought he had a Bribe to let her go . Q . Can you say that is the Pot you saw between three and four in the Morning , in the Prisoners Custody ? Butler . Yes , I can safely take my Oath of it , with a clear Conscience ; here is a particular Mark upon it ; here is a Bulge in the Side , and a Flaw in the Rim ; there is not one Pot in five Thousand more remarkable ; I examined it , when they asked me the 17 s. for it ; I saw it upon Hudson 's Head that Morning ; he went then by the Name of Cock Eye ; Hudson was the Person who offered it to Sale , and the rest were officious in saying it was worth so much ; I saw it in all their Hands . Hudson . I never saw the Man in my Life . Butler . I have seen him a great many Times ; there are so many of them , that a Man can not come along Day or Night , but he is liable to be knock 'd down ; I have seen Hudson frequently picking of Pockets . Ann Rowe . This is my Pot ; I have been Mistress of it 17 Years ; it was fixed in Brick-Work , like a Copper ; it was there a quarter of an Hour after Eleven , May 29 , at Night , and it was gone the 30th , before six in the Morning . John Rowe . It was pulled out of the Brick-Work , and the Iron-Work with it . Q . Was it fixed to the Freehold ? John Rowe . I had built a little Shed , and the Brick-Work was fixed to the Wall ; the Chimney was carried up with the Wall ; we could pull this down without pulling down the Wall belonging to the House , but not without pulling down the Brick-Work it was fixed in .

Nicholas Cunliff . I was informed the next Morning after these Things were lost , that I was robbed of my Linnen . I saw that it was advertised ; I went and enquired after it , and found it in the Hands of the Headborough , Mr Lindsey , at the Corner of Darby-street , in Rosemary-Lane . - I can not swear to the Linnen , but I believe it to be my Linnen by the Marks ; I can swear to the Stockings . Susannah Wildhore proved the Linnen to be the Property of Mr Cunliff , and said , that she hung the Linnen out in the Garden to dry , between twelve and one in the Day , on the 21st of June , and left them out all Night , and that they were gone the next Morning . John Burton . I have known the Prisoner about a Fortnight ; about two o'Clock on a Tuesday Morning , I can not tell the Day of the Month , the Prisoner got over a great Wall , into the Church Yard , and then into Mr Cunliff 's Garden , and took all these Things off the Lines ; there were four of us ; the Watchmen beset us all . I was taken up by Mr Lindsey , the Watchman , with the Things upon me ; the Watchmen popped out upon us all of a sudden ; the Prisoner , and the two others ran away . - The Wall was so high that he could not get over it without his Legs being helped up ; nobody was over the Wall but the Prisoner . - Lindsey . I took the Linnen from Burton ; he stood upon one Step , and the Linnen lay upon another . I saw three of them together at first ; two of them flew down like two Birds ; at first I thought they had been Figures chalked up against the Wall , I did not reckon there was any Men there . - I believe the Prisoner was one that run down the Steps . - I saw but three in all . - I took Burton upon the Steps : I believe if Webb , the Watchman , had not come to my Assistance , they would have knocked me on the Head . I think I heard an Expression , if I had known he had been coming , I would have knocked his Brains cut : Burton said I was a Watchman , but I am an Officer : Burton said , he wished I had been damned , and in Hell , before I saw him . G - d d - n your Blood , says he , I can tell what you can do ; you can send me to New-Prison , and then I shall go to Kingston .

Q . How did you discern the Prisoner ? Fennel . By the Light of a Candle in the House , where I drank the Pint of Beer ; and the Woman of the House said , it was a Shame to use a Man so . - I have known the Prisoner ever since April last , by living in the Neighbourhood . I do not know whether he knew me or not . Q . Who kneeled upon your Breast ? Fennel . Neither of these two Men . Q . Who took your Money out of your Pocket ? Fennel . He that kneeled upon my Breast did not take my Money , it was another . - The Prisoner was the Person that first knocked me down . Q . How could you see that the Prisoner was the Man that knocked you down first ? Fennel . It was by the Light of the Candle , that was held out of the Window . Q . When was it that you first cried out ? Fennel . I did not cry out 'till I was knocked down . Q . Can you take upon you to say , that the Prisoner was the first Person that knocked you down ? Fennel . Yes : I could see every Thing as plain as can be ; I saw the Man 's Face as plain as can be ; if there was no Light but the Light of the Element , there was Light enough to see his Face . Prisoner . Please to enquire into his Character ; because they can not hang me for what they tried me for before , they have trumped up this Thing ; I know no more of it than the Child unborn . John Burton . On the 21st of this Month , about 11 o'Clock at Night , the Prisoner , two more , and myself , went into the Blue Anchor in Rag Fair , to drink a Pint of Beer ; while we were there , the Prosecutor came in , and called for a Pint of Beer ; while he was drinking the Pint of Beer , there was a young Woman came to the Door , and he asked her to drink , and he wanted the Woman to pay for the Pint of Beer : The Landlady turned the Woman out of Doors , and would not let her be along with him . While he was drinking this Pint of Beer , we resolved , when he went out , to rob him ; and when he got about twenty Yards from the House , the Prisoner at the Bar struck him with a Mop-stick , and knocked his Hat and Wig off first , and then the Prisoner struck him several Times more , and at last knocked him down . After he was knocked down , two of us fell upon him , and took the Money out of his Pocket ; the Prisoner is the Man who took the Money out of his Pocket . In the mean Time , while he was taking the Money out of his Pocket , the Woman who keeps the Blue . Anchor , came out with a Candle , and as we were going to run away , the Prosecutor laid hold on the Prisoner ; and one of the Persons , who is got off , beat the Prosecutor very much with a Mop-stick ; then we all got away , and the Prosecutor pursued us a good Way afterwards .

Deveil ; there was a Woman , who said , the Prisoner was a very honest Woman ; but the Colonel said , he had seen her at least eight or nine Times ; and she abused the Colonel in a very particular Manner . - I have not had my Purse again .

The latter End of April , or the Beginning of May , the Prisoners came into my Shop in the Poultry , and desired to look at some Lawn ; I shewed them different Sorts , and I believe they were with me about a Quarter of an Hour , but bought nothing : About half an Hour after they were gone , Mr Wiseham came into my Shop , and asked me if I had lost any thing , and at the same Time produced this Piece of Lawn , which I immediately knew to be mine ; he told me , there were two Women in his Shop who had dropped it there , and if I would go to his Shop I might see them : Accordingly I went , and there I saw the two Women who had been in my Shop just before , which are the two Prisoners at the Bar ; I had seen it about two Days before . Thomas Wiseham . The Beginning of May , the two Prisoners came into my Shop , and asked for some Cambrick , I shewed them some which they said was too fine for them . I went to take down another Box of Cambricks , and as I was doing it , I saw the Little One in the Red Cloak , ( Chaloner , ) shuffling something downward into her Pocket , or into her Cloaths . I could not discover which as she stood close to the Counter ; I was very much surprized , and stood a Minute or two where my Box stood , and had hardly Power to stir ; I fixed my Eyes upon her , and she her 's upon me : I stood still for some Minutes , and did not speak a Word . Poole , pretended to fall into a Fit , says Chaloner to Poole , Molly , my dear , Molly , what are you a going ? Molly , my dear Molly ; Sir , I hope you will not take it amiss , this Gentlewoman is frequently troubled with Fits , four , five , or six , in a Day ; says I , I believe this a Fit of Conscience , if it was a real Fit I should discover it . I saw some Tears come out of the Corners of her Eyes , and I thought it was a Fit of Sorrow ; she was about ten Minutes before she came out of this Fit ; then they looked upon me , and I upon them a good while , and said nothing : At last says Chaloner , Pray , Sir , what is your Cambrick a Yard ; I said 4 s. she said , cut off a Quarter of a Yard ; I cut off a Quarter of a Yard , and she gave me a Shilling : Upon which as they were going out of the Shop , I said , Hark you , young Woman , I must have a Word with you before we part ; upon which I led them both into the back Shop , says I , I am very sorry that I have Occasion to say it , but I am positive of what I am going to say , I am sure you have robbed me of something , and I will search you before you go out of my Shop ; I shall be sorry for what I have said , if you are not guilty . When I was going to search them , this Piece of Lawn of Mr Brown 's was dropped in the Shop ; they stood both close together , and it was found under them upon the Ground : One Mr Bishop , who was in the Shop at that Time , took it up , and asked me , before the Prisoner , if this was not my Property ; says he , I saw her , ( Poole , ) lay it down ; No , said I , I have nothing of this Quality in the House , but no doubt but it may belong to one of my Neighbours ; said I , do you keep them here , and I will go through the whole Street but I will find out the Owner , if 't is possible . I went among my Neighbours and into Mr Brown 's , and asked if he knew any Thing of it ; he owned it , and came to my Shop , and charged the Prisoners . Then I took them into a farther back Room , and put my Hands on the outside of their Petticoats , but found nothing ; so I desired my Wife to search them , and sent them up Stairs , and I saw them drop a Piece of Lawn upon the Stairs . I did not know I could indict them for it as it was dropped in the House ; if I had found it upon them , I would have put it into another Indictment . Mr Bishop said , I have seen you several Times at Guildhall : Poole said , she had been lately deluded by Chaloner , and said she had not been used to this Part of Life , and had been honestly brought up ; that her Friends live in the Country , and that she came to Town very lately . I asked her how she came acquainted with Chaloner ; she said , she met with her in the Street one Evening , and said she wanted a Lodging , and Chaloner said she should go and lie with her , and the Lodging was upon the bare Boards . - When Bishop said he saw her lay it down , she did not deny it . - I can not say that she owned it . Jonathan Wheelwright . I have known Poole from her Infancy , she was born in the County Town of Stafford , of very just , honest , sober People . I can not account for the Reason of her coming to Town , but her Conduct and Behaviour there , was what induced me to believe her to be a very honest sober Girl , and what induced me to appear for her . She was particularly noted for her Industry under my Father ( Mr Samuel Tooke ) with whom she lived some Time a Servant , she always bore a good Character . - The Business she followed here was the selling of Hard Ware : She kept a Stall in the Borough of Southwark . John Hurt had enquired her Character of several People who came from Stafford , and says she has a good Character . Acquitted . 347. Marcus Polak , of St Bennet Fink , London , Jeweller , was indicted for stealing a Gold Ring , with an Emerald Stone set with twelve small Diamonds , value 7 l. the Goods of Ann Markham , June 1 . Ann Markham . The Prisoner is the Person who had a Ring found in his Custody , which I lost the the latter End of last March , or the Beginning of April , from off my Counter : A Jew and his Interpreter came into the Shop to ask for some Goods he had bespoke of me , which were some Smelling-Bottles , mounted with Gold ; and there came a Lady , her Child , and Servant , into the Shop ; I was behind the Counter , and had the Ring in my Hand , putting it into a little black Case , in order to send it to a Customer of mine in the Country : The Jew stood nearest to me ; I held the Ring in my Left Hand even while I served the Customer . - I might lay it down and take my Hand off it to pull out a Drawer , and then lay my Hand upon it again ; the Jew had no Occasion to stay for any Thing . for I told him I had none of the Things he wanted . I missed it the very Minute the Jew was gone , for I designed to carry it away the Minute I was at Leisure . The Lady and the Jew went away pretty near together . - I did not pursue the Jew immediately , for I was willing to mistrust my self first , and think whether I might not have laid it aside . - It was an Emerald Ring , with twelve Rose Diamonds ; there is the Socket of the old Ring . Mr Batalliard , one of my Workmen , happened to come into the Shop , I desired he would go to the Coffee-House among the Dealers , and endeavour to find out whether such a Thing was offered to sale , and for fear I should not meet with the same Ring again , I desired him to get an Emerald as near that as possible , to make the Gentleman another Ring . Some considerable Time afterwards , he brought me a Stone , and laid it down upon the Counter ; I thought it was the same , because it looked prodigiously of the same Colour ( he brought it to me the last Day of May ) . When I saw the Stone , I said , Where had you this , I fancy it is the very same Stone that I lost ; when I dropp 'd it into the Socket , I said , depend upon it , it is the very Stone that came out of the Socket ; said I , I do think I am confident of it now , because it fitted to an Exactness . [ Mr Bataillard produced the Stone , and Mrs Markham said , she believed it to be the Stone that came out of her Ring ] I was sent for by my Lord Mayor the first of June , and was very much surprized to see the Prisoner , the Person who had the Ring in his Possession . I knew the Man very well before , and if I do him Justice , I do not know that he came into the Shop at the same Time that I lost the Ring . I had an ill Opinion of the Prisoner before , and was surprized to see him ; He used as generally as he came by to open the Door , and ask if I had looked out my Diamonds , for he wanted to buy some Diamonds of me ; and when he came and asked for them , I told him I had not them ready . I made that Excuse because I did not care to show him them . - I can not tell the Value of the Emerald in particular . Prisoner . I hear very well what she says , she did after this Time always order me to come to her House , and desired me about a Week ago , to bring her some Pearls , and told me she had not looked out the Diamonds ; as to this Emerald I bought it of Jacob Stebeno [ His right Name is Jacob Moses , Stebeno being only a Nick-name ] Uuldrick Battaillard , sworn . ( Mr Battaillard desired an Interpreter , because he could not speak good English ; who was sworn , but Mr Battaillard was examined himself . ) Mrs Markham told me , that she had lost a Ring out of her Shop , and desired that I would go in to Chadwell 's Coffee-House , to look among the Merchant-Jewellers , to see after this Ring . - She said it was an Emerald with twelve Rose Diamonds set round about it . - This was in May , and about three Weeks ago , I went to Mr Attleborough in Cannon Street , to look upon some Goods , and found this Emerald there . I desired Leave to show it Mrs Markham , and she said it was her 's . Prisoner . I did say if this was the Emerald , that I sold it to Mr Zechariah Levi . Court . You need not to accuse yourself . Prisoner 's Counsel . To be sure it is the best Way to own it ; what signifies denying a Thing which can be proved ? Q. to Battalliard . Do you think Mrs Markham can swear to it ? Battalliard . I think she may . I believe every one that sees it is the same Stone that came out of that Ring . Prisoner . I bought it of Jacob Stebeno ; he brought me the Ring in a little black Box ; there was two Grains and a Quarter of Diamond , at 5 l. a Carrat , and I gave him 3 l. 10 s. for the Ring . The Counsel for the Prisoner objected against Stebeno being examined . Judah Jacobs , sworn . Judah Jacobs . I can not say that I know this Stone , for there are many Stones of this Kind . I was going one Day into Spittal-Fields , with some Goods , and in Gravel-Lane I saw the Prisoner standing with Jacob Stebeno , ( I think it was between two and three o'Clock ; ) said I to Mr Polak , How do you do ? What do you do here ? Said he , if you will come into the Publick-House , ( I think it was the Three Compasses ) I will give you a Tankard of Beer . As we were setting there , Stebeno showed Mr Polak a Ring , with a green Stone in the Middle set round with Diamonds . - I can not tell how many ; if I am not sure I will not say it ; if I was positive I would speak it . - There might be nine , ten , or twelve . Polak asked Stebeno , how he came by the Ring ; Stebeno said he found it in the Street ; Polak asked him what was the Price of it ; said Stebeno , I can not say the Price , I will leave it to your own Judgment , I know you are a Man who will give me the Value of it , and will not wrong me : Polak said , If I should be honest to you , I can not tell what it comes too without taking out the Stones and weighing them : So Polak took out the middle Stone and the Diamonds , and weighed them in a Scale . I can not tell what he weighed the Diamonds to , whether two Grains and a Quarter , or what , but Polak said , he would give him 3 l. 10 s. for it ; says he , If any body will give you more , take it , - or if you can get any more take it , and come to me last . Stebeno said he would leave it with him ; - Stebeno agreed to take the 3 l. 10 s. - and he gave him a Guinea in Part . Mrs Markham . The Price of the Ring to the Person who employed me is Ten Guineas . Q. to Jacobs . Did you meet them accidenttally ? Judah Jacobs . Yes . Q . Are you Partner with the Prisoner ? Judah Jacobs . No , I am not . Mrs Markham . He is Partner with Mr Polak . Judah Jacobs . I am not Partner with him ; if a Man goes along with me to buy any Thing at a Pawnbroker 's Shop , I may go Part in it , but I am not his Partner because of that . - I go into Flanders , and other Parts with Goods ; I shall go into the Wars with Goods . Judah Galinda . I happened to meet the Prisoner and Alexander Joseph , I do not know whether Judah Jacobs was there , but if I was not mistaken they were all three there ; they took me into the Crown Alehouse , and talking about a Ring that the Prisoner bought of Stebeno , that was stole , they desired me to write an Advertisement , with two Guineas Reward for any Person who should apprehend Jacob Stebeno , and I wrote it ; but I never saw it in any Paper . Pris . Counsel . It was printed , and they did endeavour to take him up . Galinda . I do not know any Thing of that . Jacob Isaacs . I was informed that Stebeno was seen walking , with a Friend of his at the Wells . I went to the Mulberry Garden in White-Chapel , and saw the Prisoner , with two Gentlemen , who came from Holland ; I told him , that Stebeno was seen walking in the Wells ; says the Prisoner . You may keep a Watch , and I will give you two Guineas if I can take him ; Mr Galinda , the Prisoner , and another Gentleman went to the wells , to see if Stebeno was there - the Prisoner gave me two Guineas and his Watch , but I gave him his Watch again - he gave me his Watch in Hand for the two Guineas , by way of Pledge . Myer Isaacs . The Prisoner sent for me and a Constable this Day three Weeks , to go and see for Jacob Moses ( who is called Stebeno ) and if I catched him , he said , I should have a Crown , otherwise , he would give me a Shilling for my Trouble ; so he gave me a Shilling ; I and the Constable met with Stebeno in Gravel-Lane , and as soon as he saw me and the Constable he run away . Q . Did you speak to him ? Myer Isaacs . How could I speak to him if he run away ; if I can catch him , he should not run away . Jacob Aaron . I am a Constable : The Prisoner sent for me to take up Stebeno ; and Judah Jacobs went with me for Assistance ; we went into Petticoat-Lane in White-Chapel , and a Gentleman told us he run that way ; I did not see Stebeno . Q . Did you see any Body run . Jacob Aaron . I saw another Man run , but it was not Stebeno ; says the Prisoner , I do not want that Man . David Solomon . I have known the Prisoner as long as he has been in London - about a Year - he is a Jeweller ; I knew him six or eight Years in Holland - I never heard any Harm of him ; and never suspected him ; I have trusted him several Times , and always found him to be honest . Joseph Coleman . I have known him about a Year , by his using the Coffee-house , which the Jewellers frequent : I do not know any Thing of his Character ; I never heard any Harm of him . Zachariah Barnes . I have knwon him about twelve Months ; he rents a House of ten Guineas a Year of me , and pays me very honestly ; I take him to be a very honest Man . Enoch Solomon . I have known him eight or nine Years ; I knew him before he went from England ; he always behaved like a Gentleman ; he left a Trifle unpaid when he went away , and when he came back he paid me ; he is my Diamond-Cutter . Isaac Abrahams . I keep a Coffee-house ; I have known him eight or nine Years ; I knew him before he went to Holland , and never heard any Harm of him , before this . John Catterns . I take in Advertisements for the Daily-Advertiser : Mr Polak , the Prisoner , and another Gentleman , brought this to me to be advertised ; and three or four Days afterwards it was sent back again - because there were some Persons Names in it ; and they have oftentimes come into Trouble for putting in Peoples Names ; the Prisoner came to enquire , why it was not put into the Advertiser , and I told him the Printer of the Paper refused to put it in . [ The written Paper was read , which was to the following Purpose : Whereas , Marcus Polak bought a Ring of Jacob Moses , otherwise Stebeno ; and the said Jacob Moses has since absconded ; therefore Marcus Polak does promise any Body two Guineas Reward , who should apprehend the said Jacob Moses , so as he may be brought to Justice ; to be paid by Marcus Polak , at his House in White-Street . No . 4 . ] Jacob Stebeno sworn . - My Circumcision Name is Jacob Moses Q . What do you know of this Ring ? Jacob Moses . It signifies nothing showing this Ring to me ; I know nothing of it , but what I heard , that this Polak was taken up about it . Court . Look at it ? Jacob Moses . What should I look at a Thing for that I never saw in my Life ? ( looks at it ) Now I am as wise as I was before ; I never saw that Ring before , nor that Stone . Court . Did not you deal with Polak for a Ring that had a Stone ( an Emerald ) in it , of that Colour , and Diamonds round it ? Jacob Moses . No : I do not know any Thing of it . Court . Did you never meet with Judah Jacobs in Gravel-Lane , nor never go with him and Polak into the Three-Compasses ? Jacob Moses . No , I never did . Q . Are you a Jeweller ? Jacob Moses . No , I am not a Jeweller ; I never found it nor sold it ; if his Lordship will be so good as to hear me , I will give an Account of the Affair . [ The Council for the Prisoner argued , that he could not see how this Man could be admitted an Evidence against the Prisoner ; when the Prisoner had charged him with this Fact ; and published an Advertisement , with a Reward for the taking him ; but this the Court over-ruled . ] Jacob Moses . I hope my Lord , and the Gentlemen of the Jury , will hear how I was like to have been drawn in : One Night , when I came Home , about eight o'Clock , I heard that Polak the Prisoner had been taken up about a Ring ; and that , he said , he had bought the Ring of one Jacob Stebeno ; said I , I must go and enquire about this ; I went , and found this Polak out ; I light of this Judah Jacobs , said I , where is your Partner ? he said , he had no Partner ( but though , he said , he had no Partner , I will prove he has been his Partner ever since he was in London ) I said , pray what is the Meaning of your Partner 's putting my Name in Print about that Ring ; and to put my Name in Question before my Lord Mayor ; he said , what would you have of him , he is a Madman in all his Actions , I can not help what he said - he said , You know he is a Madman , and does not know what he should say ; then , I said , I must go and hear what Reason he will give for this ; then Judah Jacobs went to the Door , and said to me , I will not be seen by him , for he has not seen me yet ; he went with me to Polak 's Door ( for Polak was then bailed out , and had given Security ) no sooner did Mr Jacobs come to the Door , but he refused to go in ; Polak 's Wife came out first , and opened the Door ; said she , Who was with you , I Saw some-body run away ; Mr Polak then came to the Door to me , said I , to Mr Polak , what a Villain must you be to put my Name in Question ; I have been sixteen Years in England , and never was before a Court , not so much as a Court of Conscience ; for God 's Sake , said he , forgive me , that I put your Name in Question ; for the Name of Jacob came into my Mouth , and I did not know which way to make it out ; I will make you Satisfaction , it will be over in three or four Days ; and I will give you five Guineas when the Thing is over , and made up with Madam Markham ; it will not hold long , I will make an End of it - he said , he would give me five Guineas , to say , that I found the Ring , And then neither you nor I shall be in any Danger , for the Thing shall be made up with Mrs Markham ; that same Night , he said , You may go Home to your Wife to Night , but after this , you must not show your self in Dukes-Place , to-morrow or next Day , or till it was made up ; and I left him about a quarter of an Hour after Eleven at Night , and went Home ; Jacob Aaron , the Constable , was on Duty that Night ; and he said , to me , How can you come here this Night , when such a Thing is spoken of you , that you were the Person who sold the Ring to Polak ; I said , thank God , I am not afraid ; if you are a Constable you may take hold of me - I said , I am here , I am not afraid of any Thing ; as you are upon Duty , you may lay hold of me as well as another , if you think I am the Person . I went into Alexander Joseph 's Coffee-house , and there was the Constable ; and a Man in the Coffee-House said , I might lay hold of you ; I said , Here is the Constable , he may lay hold of me ; I staid in the House till about 12 o'Clock , and then went Home to Bed : the next Day I obliged Mr Polak , and staid away from Dukes-Place ; about half an Hour after two in the Afternoon , this Mr Judah Jacobs ( his Partner ) came to me , and said , You will see Mr Polak will be with you about five o'Clock , or to-morrow ; but I did not see him that Day , nor the Day following ; I went to his House again the Day after , and he came out to me ; said I , Mr Polak , is this your fine Tricks , that I must keep away from my Wife and Children , and you slight me in this Manner ; so he put his Hand in his Pocket and gave me two Shillings ; I went away that Night , and he promised he would see me again , and so he kept it on for a Fortnight running . Q . Did he never come near you ? Jacob Moses . He came near me , and sent Judah Jacobs to me , but he kept me from Home for about a Fortnight ; if you please , my Lord , I will tell you , as to this Constable that was employed to take me up ; Judah Galinda came to me two or three Times , and talked to me about it , and said , he could not help it . Q . Do you know Judah Galinda came at the Request of Polak ? Jacob Moses . He told me Polak would be with me at five o'Clock ; and Polak came to me ; he said , I tell you , what I must do , I must do it for my own Safety ; said he , do you sit here , and I will send the Constable , with another Man , but I will tell them they shall not meddle with you ; but it is necessary for me , in order to the making of it up , to say , that you run away ; he said , that he would not hurt a Hair of my Head ; and that the Constable should not lay hold of me ; after this Mr Polak sent the Constable after me . This was on the Friday . Q . Did he send any Constable ? Jacob Moses . I did not see any Constable . Q . Did not you run ? Jacob Moses . I did not run , nor no such Thing , what should I be afraid of ? the Sunday after Polak came to me at Mr Taylor 's House , at the Rose and Crown in Catherine-Wheel-Alley ( where I was ) and drank a Tankard of Beer with me , and he called me out into the Yard ; I told him I wondered he kept me up so ; that I did not see him ; and kept me from my Wife , and slighted me so , and gave me no Money ; he said , I do assure you , that you shall be out of the Way no longer than next Tuesday , for I have employed a Gentleman to make it up ; who should come in then but Judah Galinda ( that is the Man that wrote the Advertisement ) then Galinda came , and sat down by the Table ; says Galinda to me , If you will be easy and quiet , between this and next Tuesday it will be made up ; for I shall go to Mrs Markham to-morrow , in order to make it up ; said I , when you go to Mrs Markham 's I w ill go along with you ; said he , with all my Heart , but you shall not go in with me at first , but go into the Horseshoe and Magpye ; and Mr Galinda went into Mrs Markham 's , but what Discourse they had then I can not tell ; ( now I recollect my Memory Mr Galinda could not go on the Tuesday ; he is a Clerk and teaches Children ; it was on the Wednesday ) Mr Galinda said about a Quarter of an Hour , and then he came out , and called me from the Horseshoe to the Gentlewoman 's Shop ; when I came to the Shop , Madam was sitting backward , with her Family ; said I , Your humble Servant , Madam , do you know me ? She looked hard at me from Top to Bottom ; I said , look as hard as you please , Madam ; said her Daughter , go behind the Counter , and look at him : Pray , Madam , said I , in what Posture shall I stand , with my Hat on or off ? I spoke that before Mr Galinda ; Madam looked at me , and said , I am sure you are not the Person , for he was not so lusty , and had not the Speech as you have ; said she , I am sure there was but one Place where you could find it , and desired to know where I did find it ; I said , Madam , I have a Word to speak between four Eyes , between you and me : she went backwards , and then , said I , Madam , I do assure you , I neither found the Ring , nor stole it , nor sold it - that was at the Time I went with Judah Galinda ; and I said to the Gentlewoman , Madam , it is a troublesome Sort of a Thing , if you can make it up with these People do , that was all I said , and then I went away . Prisoner . There 's Judah Galinda present , he can contradict what he says - I never promised him five Guineas to say that he found it , I never said any such Thing in my Life . Q. to Stebeno ( Jacob Moses ) did you ever declare to any Body that you found this Ring ? Jacob Moses . No otherwise than in Relation to the five Guineas that Polak offered me ; I said to every Body these Words , Mordecai Polak gave me these five Guineas to keep out of the Way - I never did say to any Body that I found the Ring . Prisoner 's Council . Do you know Myer Isaacs ? Jacob Moses . Yes , he mends Shoes for me . Prisoner 's Council . Did not he and Judah Jacobs come to take you up ? Jacob Moses . I did not run away . Mrs Markham . Judah Jacobs came to me to make up the Affair , and pretended to do it on my behalf , and said , that I should be paid for the Ring , or have another made as near that as possible ; and desired that , for their Sakes ( the Prisoner , and Stebeno ) and my own , it might be made up . Q . Did he make use of the Name of any Person that he came from ? Mrs Markham . No , I do not remember that he did : I asked him if I could not see the Person that found it , and , he said , I should see him immediately ; and in about five Minutes he fetched Stebeno ; I viewed him , and though he was much of same Size , I did not think him to be the same Person , that I believed stole the Ring ; I asked him whether he would oblige me , in telling me where he found the Ring ; for I told him there was but one Place where he could find it ; immediately , upon my asking him that Question , he desired me to step back with him ; and he assured me , he never stole the Ring , found the Ring , or sold the Ring , or Words as near to them as I can remember ; but , he said , if I would make up this Affair , he would open such a Scene that I never knew . Mr Galinda about a Week after came again , to know if I would make it up , and was with me three or four Times . Abraham Davids . Judah Galinda is a Master of Languages ; I employed him to learn me English ; and he , not coming , I asked him why he did not come , he said , he was making up a Business for Mr Polak and Stebeno ; this Jacob Moses was my Servant . Aaron Polock . - I am no Relation of the Prisoner 's , but I knew him before he went out of England , and since he came Home ; and his Character was this , that he would come to this unhappy Case , as a Prisoner at the Bar ; and some People who are come to give him a Character have been transported Levi Joshua was called , and Polock bid to look at him . Aaron Polock . I know him very well - When any of these People come here , I will come of my own Accord , on Purpose to put a Stop to these Proceedings . Isaac Elias . I was at the Poultry Compter to see some Friends , and Stebeno said , I am brought here for Mr Polak the Prisoner ; he said , he found the Ring , and sold it to Mr Polak ; but now , said he , as he has taken me up , I will deny it - I was a Debtor in the Poultry Compter , and I had a Relation there , that was the Occasion of my going . Judah Galinda . ( Called again ) When I first went to Stebeno , said I , How is this Case with you ; he said , he did find the Ring ; but , said he , if any Body henceforth asks you how I came by it , you need not say how I came by it ; but he did not say so to me afterwards ; I thought at that Time that he did find it - Judah Jacobs employed me to make it up . Q . Did not Polak desire you to go to make it up ? Galinda . No , he never spoke to me about it in my Life . Acquitted . 348.

Elizabeth Trigg , for receiving the same knowing them to be stole . Samuel Ware deposed , that Hannah Clap worked with him in his Shop , in the Business of Silk Throwing ; that he had at different Times missed a great many Bobbins of Silk , and that he had some Reason to suspect the Prisoner ; that on the 21st of this Month , he charged her with robbing him , and that she then voluntarily , ( and without any Threatnings ) confessed that she stole three Bobbins of Silk out of his Shop , and had given them to Elizabeth Trigg ; that Hannah Clap had sworn , that Elizabeth Trigg received them of her .

John Read , of London , was indicted for stealing two Pair of Chints Window Curtains , and forty Yards of Chints , value 6 l. and three Yards of Damask , value 6 s. the Goods of John Jenkins , Feb. 9 . last . And 351. Rachel Joseph , otherwise Elizabeth Bayley , for receiving the same knowing them to be stole . John Jenkins . I live in Great Queen-street , by Lincoln's-Inn Fields . On the 9th of February last , I lost seven Pieces of Chints Hangings , and two Pair of Chints Window Curtains , and part of a Silk Damask Gown , and a Counterpane , the same as the Chints : I had an Information of them the 22d of February , and found them at one Mr Boyreas , or Boyers , in Dukes-Place ; and they said , they bought them of Jonas and Bayley ; I found several Pieces of Chints in Boyreas 's Lodging ; Bayley at first denied it , but afterwards owned she had Part of the Goods . Jacob Mendoz . John Read , with two more who are not taken , and myself , went to Mr Jenkin 's House , in Great-Queen street , about four Months ago , about six o'Clock in the Evening ; we saw a great Bundle lying upon the Counter , and took it away , and carried it into Dukes-Place , to one Rachel Jonas , or Joseph , - but it is not that Gentlewoman ( the Prisoner ) ; I do not know any any Thing of her ; I never sold her any Thing : I delivered them into Rachel Jonas 's Hand , she lives up three Pair of Stairs in a little Room . I carried them up into the Room , and delivered them to her ; - the Prisoner was in the Room at the same Time . Thomas Smith and William Dawson were with me ; I asked her whether she would buy them , she said , she did not care to buy them then ; she ( that is Rachel Joseph 's Sister ) would send for her Son ; she looked on them , and counted them over ; - they were fine Hangings ; they were all made like Curtains . I left them there to be sold . - I used to follow the Tripe-houses , but then I followed wicked Ways . - I knew that she knew what I was , because I went with two or three Lads there before . - She does not keep a Shop , but she buys them when I have any to carry to her ; I had 19 s. for them ; I was to have had 30 s. in all , but she flung me out of all the rest , because I did not go along with her Son to fetch the Money for the Goods , but staid at her House while her Son went for the Money . - There was a handsome Bundle , they looked fine and fresh . Jenkins . They are valued at about 9 l. Rachel Joseph . Is that young Man you speak of my Son ? Mendez . I never sold any Thing to the Prisoner , it is the Prisoner 's Sister I sold them to . William Day . On the 22d or 29th , two or three Gentlemen sent for me to the Blue Boar in Whitechapel , ( that is Mr Hallet and Mr Jenkins , ) and showed me a Warrant to search . I went to the House of one Boyreas , in Dukes-Place ; I have got several Things which were found in that House . Jenkins . They are not my own Goods they belong to Miss Vernon of Twickenham ; I had them of Mr Hallet . William Day . I said to the Woman at Boyreas 's House , you must give me an Account how you came by these Goods ; she said , she had them of her Husband , and he was not in the Way . When I got hold of the Man there were several Jews who said , it it a Pity he should suffer , we can help you to the right Person they had them of , and they told me , that the Woman was the Person , and afterwards the woman said , that she had them of the Evidence , and that they sold them to this Boyreas . I went to Boyreas House yesterday , and told them there was a fresh * Bill preferred , and would have had them come here , but they would not come . * Rachel Joseph was committed to Newgate on the 7th of May for this Fact , and was discharged at the last Sessions for want of Prosecution . Jenkins . I have not made Satisfaction for the Goods yet , but I am to do it . Prisoner Read . I never saw the Prisoner in my Life , before I came before the Justice of the Peace . William Hailet .

I was not for her buying it , because I thought it was rotten ; my Wife said she would put a Linning to it , and it would serve for the Nursery , and she gave her 9 s. for it . She said her Husband was dead , and she was going to sell off all her Things ; that Quilt stands me in 30 s. and I can buy a new one cheaper ; that Man in the Blue Coat said , he wanted to say something to my Wife in private , he went to Alderman Heathcote for a Warrant , and he knowing me to be a Man of Credit , he would not allow it , ( grant it . ) I said to the Man , Sir , you are a Stranger to me , if you will give me the Charge I have been at , you shall have it .
