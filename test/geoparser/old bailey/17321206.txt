Hannah Sealy , of St. Martins Ludgate , was indicted for privately stealing a Velvet Manteel , value 40s . and one Yard of Velvet , value 12s . the Goods of Barnard Townsend , November 3 . B. Townsend . I was not at home when the Goods were lost ; but hearing of it afterwards , an Advertisement was put in the Papers , by which means , I was informed that the Prisoner lodg 'd at Mrs. Howard 's , a Coffee-House , in Bell-Savage Yard . I went thither on the 11th of November , and found the Prisoner . I ask 'd her , If she was not at my Shop about a Week before to buy Half a Yard of Muslin ? She said , Yes . And did you not , says I , take away a Manteel , and a Piece of Velvet ? She answered , Yes ; and she said , she had made the Velvet into a Hood . Milliscent Nicholas . I was in Mr. Townsend 's Shop when the Prisoner came in . It was the 3d of November , in the Evening . She ask 'd to see some Muslin ; I order 'd Candles to be brought , and then shew 'd her some . She wanted Half a Yard , and whilst we were disputing about the Price , another Customer came in , and while I turn 'd my back to serve her , I suppose the Prisoner took away the Goods : For the Manteel with a Bill of Parcels pinn 'd up in it , lay ready for a Gentleman who had bespoke it , and a Person coming to fetch it , in about Half an Hour after the Prisoner was gone , I miss 'd both that , and a Piece of Velvet of about a Yard with a Slope on it . I suspected she had taken it , and told Mr. Townsend so when he came in . I saw her no more till Nov. 11. when she was taken at Mrs. Howard 's . She readily confess 'd that she took the Manteel and the Piece of Velvet out of the Shop ; that she tore the Slope of the Piece of Velvet , and made it into a Hood , and that she burnt the Bill of Parcels . Prisoner . I do n't know what I confess 'd ; they came on me by Surprize . I own I had the Goods , but they were sent me from the Bath . Are you sure it was I that came to cheapen Muslin ? M. Nicholas . Yes . Prisoner . What Cloaths had I on ? M. Nicholas . A short Mob and a wash 'd Gown ; you was clean dress 'd , and looked like a tight Girl . Elizabeth Howard . The Prisoner came to me as a Lodger November 4. and gave me these Things in security for her Lodging till her Uncle came to Town . The Constable confirm 'd the Prisoner 's Confession , and the Jury found her Guilty to the value of 4s . 10d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 2.

She was a second Time indicted for stealing two Gold Rings , the Goods of Magdalen King , and a Suit of Head-Clothes , and a Night-Gown , the Goods of Robert Holms , April 30 . 1731 . The Prisoner lived above a Year in the Service of Mr. Holms and his Mother-in-Law Mrs. King , who lived in the same House . From thence she went to Mr. Scoley 's , where she continued about 3 Months , and he ( not missing any thing then ) recommended her to Col. Armstrong in the Tower . Mr. Holms after some time missing his Goods , traced her to Col. Armstrong 's , where she , in hopes to escape , jump 'd out of the Window and broke her Thigh . Some of Mr. Holms 's , Mrs. King 's , and Mr. Scoley 's Goods were found in her Box , and the Gown in the Bog-House , all which she confess 'd she stole . She was sent to the Hospital , and there confess 'd where the rest of the Goods were pawn 'd , which were accordingly found by her Directions . The Jury found her guilty of both Indictments .

Nov. 27 . John Ferrers . The Prisoner came into our Shop , in Blowbladder-Street , to sell some Goods . We did not chasser with him then , but he setting them down at the farthest end of the Shop , went towards the Street Door , and stood leaning with his Back against the Counter . I and my Maid watch 'd him ( for I had lost some Goods the Saturday before ) and we saw him put his Hands behind him , and take a Parcel of white Balladine Silk out of a Wrapper , and thrust into his Bosom . Then he walk 'd a Yard or two farther into the Shop , and I went and collar 'd him , and order 'd my Man to take the Silk out of his Bosom , which he did : I weigh 'd it , and sent for a Constable . The Prisoner seemed very much surpriz 'd , and said the Devil egg 'd him on to do it . This Evidence was corroborated by the Maid and others , and the Jury found him Guilty to the value of 4s . 10d .

He was a third Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . William Percival . The Deceas 'd was my Brother . The Prisoner was a Basketman in St. James 's Market . He was spreading some Butter upon a Roll , and when he had spread one Piece he laid it on the Stall , and begun to spread the other Piece : while he was doing it , the Deceas 'd came and took up the Piece that was butter 'd , and said , Wo n't you give me this ? And then put it to his Mouth in jest , as if he design 'd to eat it , tho ' he did not bite a bit of it ; but the Prisoner having a Knife in his Hand , struck at the Deceas 'd with it . The Deceas 'd retreated and fell into a Tub of Blood that stood behind him , and getting out again , he struck the Prisoner , and presently after said , I am a dead Man . Dead , says I , how can that be , I see no Blood ? But when I turn 'd up his Shirt , I saw his Guts hang out . I carry 'd him to Mr. Didier the Surgeon , who sew 'd up the Wound , and then he was sent to the Work-House , where he dy 'd next Morning . - Parker . The Deceas 'd took a Piece of the Prisoner 's Bread and Butter , and going a little back with it , fell over a Blood-Tub , but got up again , and struck the Prisoner several Blows , and then he said he was dead , and so he went out of the Market . I did not see the Prisoner stab him , for I was over the Way . - Boswell . I saw the Prisoner spread half a Roll , and lay it on the Bulk . The Deceas 'd took it away , the Prisoner struck at him . He fell over a Tub , got up again , and hit the Prisoner 3 or 4 Blows , and then clapping his Hand to his Belly , said , he was cut . Then get a Surgeon , says I . He went out of the Market , and I saw the Knife in the Prisoner 's Hand . It was a little dirty at the Point , but it smelt of nothing . Mary Davis . I am Nurse at St. James 's Work-house . The Deceas 'd was brought in near the Evening ; I put him to Bed , and ask 'd how he came by that Misfortune ? He said , by playing the Rogue with a Man about a Piece of Bread and Butter . That he fell back , and coming forward again , the Prisoner stab 'd him in the Belly . He died about 8 in the Morning . Prisoner . I had half spread my Roll , and laid it down : The Deceas 'd snatch 'd it away ; I went to save it , and said , pray let 's have it , for I am very hungry . No you sha'n't , says he , and then he punch 'd and push 'd me about , and some how in struggling , while my Knife was in my Hand , he run against it , and then beat me about . So and please your Worship , Master , if so be he had given me my Bread and Butter there had been no Harm done . Will . Percival , again . I was in the Shop when it begun . The Deceas 'd was near the Prisoner while he was spreading the Butter , and the Prisoner run his Knife at him . There was no struggling till then , nor any Words . The Deceas 'd laid no Hands on him before the Stab was given . Court . Did not the Prisoner endeavour to save his Bread and Butter ? Percival . No , for the Deceased came behind him and took it away . A Butcher . I have known the Prisoner several Years . He is a poor foolish Fellow , and all the Boys in the Market used to make Game of him , and play Tricks with him ; I have seen 'em black his Face , and carry him about in a Basket , and then throw him out into a Kennel to wash him ; but I never saw him provoked or fall in a Passion at such Usage ; so far from it , that when he has got from them he would run into a Corner and laugh at them . He had always a very honest Character , and has often been trusted by me and several others in the Market . I never observ 'd any thing like a spiteful revengful Temper in him , let what wou 'd be done to him . The Deceased was as vile a Lad as any about the Market ; he was so idle , that he sold his Knot and Basket because he would not work , and used to loiter about and sleep upon Bulks . Several other Butchers belonging to the Market gave the like Account of the Prisoner . The Jury acquitted him of the second Indictment , and found him guilty of Manslaughter on the First and Third .

Richard Sims . I look after the Dog-house Bar . About six at Night the Prisoner came into the House , and desired me to let him warm himself by the Fire , for he said he had been with a Cart to Edmonton , and was very cold . He beg 'd an old Pair of Shoes , upon which , I took Notice that those he had on were very bad ; but I did not give him any . He staid till eight o'Clock , and then went away , and I shut up the Door as usual , and went to Supper at the Green Man on Windmill-Hill , and after Supper I returned to the House at the Bar , and went to Bed : Next Morning the Taylor came to mend my Breeches , which I had left in my Room overnight before I went to Supper , and there was two gold Rings , a Guinea and a half , and 2s . and 6d . in a brass Box in the Side-Pocket . I look 'd for my Breeches but could not find 'em , and at the same Time I mist my Hat and my Shoes . Searching farther I found the Prisoner 's old Shoes , which were tied with Packthread , at the Door , and the Cellar Door was split in two . The Shoes made me suspect the Prisoner . Next Week I met with him . He confess 'd that he broke the Cellar-Door with a great Stone , and then thrust the wooden Bolt back , and got and took the Goods ; that he had pawn 'd the Hat in Golden-lane for 6d . and the Breeches in Turnbull-Street for a 1s . He went with me to those Places , and found them there . He had my Shoes upon his Feet . - Thompson . I took the Prisoner in Coleman-street . I knew him before , and had heard there was a Warrant out against him . He had pilfer 'd some Things while he had work 'd with me there . I tax 'd him with robbing Mr. Sims . He at first denied it , but afterwards own 'd that he broke the Cellar-door open with a Stone , and had pawn 'd the Hat and Breeches , but said he was drunk when he did it . Tho . Cecil . I do keep the Dog-house-Bar for Mr. Graves , my Lord-Mayor 's Huntsman . My Breeches did hang up where I did lye , but being Zick , I was vorced to go home and leave'n there , and he have got 'en on now . Court . Go and look on 'em . Cecil . Yes , these be they , I can zafely zwear to 'n . The Prisoner made no Defence , and the Jury found him Guilty . Death . 9.

Murphey , near 11 at Night , Hewsly laid hold of me near the End of Short's-Gardens in Drury-Lane , push 'd me against a Wall , slipt her Hand into my Fob , and pull 'd out my Watch . I struggled , and took hold of the Chain , but she pull 'd the Key and Seal through my Hand , and gave it to her Companion Jones , who ran over the Way with it . I cry 'd out as loud as I could , and still kept hold of Hewsly . Jones returned presently , swore at her , and called her foolish Bitch for staying with me , and said if I made any more Noise she 'd make me hold my Tongue . The Constable and Watch came up , and I charged them with both the Prisoners . Hewsly . I was standing at a Cook's-Shop buying a Bit of Meat . I saw a Woman in a white Gown jump out of an Alley , and presently the Prosecutor came and took hold of me , and said I had robbed him . But when we went to the Constable 's House he stript us stark naked , and found nothing about us but what was our own . Murphey . She took hold of me first , and I never let her go till the Constable came . When she first surprized me , I did not know whether she was a Man or a Woman . She was searched slightly , but not stript stark naked . I found nothing on her indeed , but she had given the Watch to Jones before , and I never had it again . Joseph Griffith , Constable . I and 2 Watchmen took them , with him , at the Cook 's Door . Paul Garvy . He was at my House , the Bull-Head and Spread-Eagle in Prince's-street Drury-lane , between 9 and 10 , and he had the Watch then ; I ca n't say he was downright sober , but a little merry . Court .

Mrs. Peers . I lost a Crape Gown and Coat lin 'd with black Silk , a Lutestring Gown and Coat lin 'd with grey Silk , a white flower 'd damask Coat , and several other Apparel out of a Box , which I left lock 'd and corded in Mr. Pearson 's Garret Mr . Pearson kept a Goldsmith 's Shop by Smithfield Bars . I lodged at his House about a 12 Month , when I went away I left my Box in his Garret . I had been gone from thence about half a Year , when having Occasion for some of my Things , I went thither to fetch 'em . Mrs. Pearson went up with me . I found my Box corded and lock 'd as I left it , but as soon as I open 'd it I miss 'd my Goods . Madam , says I , somebody has robb 'd me . She seem 'd as much surpriz 'd as I was my self . The Prisoner had been her Servant , but was then gone away , and was taken up for another Fact : This gave us Occasion to suspect her . We found her at Hicks's-Hall . She confess 'd to me that she had lifted up the Lid of the Box without unlocking it , and drawn the Cloaths out and carried them to pawn , at three several Times , to Mr. Hamlin 's a Pawn-broker in Drury-lane . She cry 'd , and begg 'd me not to hang her . We went to the Pawn-broker 's , who used us very ill , and told us we should have nothing but what the Law allowed us . Mrs. Pearson . The Prisoner had been my Servant half a Year , and after she was gone from me , she was committed to Prison for another Offence . When Mrs. Peers mist her Goods , I said to her , I am afraid this Wench has robb 'd you . We saw her at Hicks's-Hall , and taking her aside , charg 'd her with this Fact . She cry 'd , and readily owned it , and said , she hop 'd I would be favourable to her , for she had not broke any Lock , but lifted up the Lid of the Box and drawn the Things out , and that she had pawn 'd them in Drury-lane . We went to the Pawn-brokers ; he deny 'd them at first , and would not deliver them till we brought her to him from Bridewell . Court . What are these Goods worth ? Mrs. Peers . About 10l . Court . Did she say she took them all at once ? Mrs. Pearson . She said she carried them out of my House at three Times , and so carried them to pawn . She went from me September 12 . Prisoner . They promised me to be merciful if I would confess . Court . What do you say to that ? Mrs. Pearson . Yes , we did . Court . Then you did Wrong . You ought not by Promise of Favour to draw Persons into Confession , and then make use of those Confessions to take away their Lives . When Confessions are obtained in such a Manner , they ought to have but little Weight with the Jury . Mrs. Pearson , We have no Desire to take away her Life . Court . It may be so . But if the Jury should find that she took the Value of 40s . at any one time , she will be capitally convicted . John Hamlin , Pawn-broker . These Goods were brought to me at 3 times ; the 5th , the 12th , and the 13th of September . On the first Parcel I lent 10 s. 6 d. 15 s. on the 2 d , and 30s . on the third . The Prisoner owned the Tickets upon them , but I ca n't swear that she was the Person that brought them . Court . It looks very ill in a Pawn-broker to receive such valuable Goods of such a Person as the Prisoner , without examining how she came by them . By her Appearance he could not imagine her to be the Owner of them . These People know if they bought Goods under such suspicious Circumstances at an under Rate , they would be liable to be prosecuted as Receivers of stolen Goods , and they think to evade the Law by lending a Trifle upon 'em to Persons who they are pretty sure will never come to redeem them . I doubt not but in these Cases they know too well that the Goods are stolen , and I hope , in time , it will be equally punished . This Man 's denying the Goods , when Persons of Credit came to demand them , has a very knavish Appearance . Officer ! do n't let the Pawn-broker go out of Court till the Jury have brought in their Verdict . David Jones . The Woman at the Pawn-broker 's had the Confidence to tell us that the Goods were not worth above 14s . more than they were pawn 'd for ; tho ' they cost above 30 l. Mrs. Pearson . He took me by the Arm and thrust me into the Street . Mr. Jones . And he said to me , The Parliament were not able to do any thing with us , and what do you pretend to do ? Joseph Baily . He abused us all in a very gross Manner . Court . Are you willing to prosecute this Man ? It will be doing Justice to your Country . Mr. Baily . As your Lordship pleases . Hamlin . I hope you wo n't serve me so . [ a-part ] . Mr. Baily . Rememember how you serv 'd us . [ a-part ] . Court . Officer , take the Pawn-broker into Custody . Hamlin . My Lord ! Court . If you can find sufficient Bail the Court will take it . Then Mr. Baily , and the other Witnesses , entered into Recognizances to prosecute the Pawn-broker at next Sessions . And the Jury found the Prisoner guilty to the Value of 39s . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 21. Daniel Ashley , was indicted for stealing 2 Pair of Shoes , Oct. 16 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 22. Robert Gardner , was indicted for stealing 2 Ounces of Silver , value 10s . the Goods of drew Drury , Nov. 4 . Drew Drury . I employ 'd the Prisoner to polish Silver for me . I had lost a great deal of Silver for above a Year past . 'T is my Method to weigh my Silver up every Saturday Night , and enter the Quantity in a Book , and I have constantly miss 'd every Week , for a considerable Time , 40 , 50 , or 60 Shillings worth . The Prisoner used to come to my Shop in a Morning before I was up , to see for Work ; I order 'd my Boys to watch him , and next Morning they told me , they saw him go to a Basket , where I put a pretty deal of Silver , and tumble it over , and then put his Hand in his Pocket 2 or 3 times . I ask 'd them , Why they did not stop him and call me ? They said , they were afraid . Upon this I was resolved to watch him my self . And so on Saturday Morning , Nov. 4 says I to my Boys , I 'll hide my self in the Closet ( for I have a Closet with a Window that looks into the Shop ) and do n't you be mealy mouth 'd now , because you know that I am so near you , but when he comes , play your Rogues Tricks , and run about as you do when I am a Bed , that he may suspect nothing , and have an opportunity of going to the Basket . I went to my Post , the Prisoner came in , and my Boys began to play their Tricks with him , and by and by one of them run out , and the other after him . The Prisoner upon this stept to the Basket , took something out , put it in his Pocket , and follow 'd them immediately . As soon as they came in again , says he , my Master will hardly came down till 9 a-Clock , I 'll e'en go , and come again , but the Boys persuaded him to go into the Kitchen , and sit down by the Fire . I left the Closet , went up Stairs , and came down again as if I was but just come out of my Chamber . The Prisoner ask 'd me , if I had any work for him ? I told him , No . I let him go out a little way , and then call 'd him back . Robin , says I , 't is Saturday , and as I have no more work for you this Week , I may as well settle Accounts , and pay you for what you have done . I sent one of my Boys for a Constable , under pretence of getting change for a Guinea . When the Constable came , I charg 'd the Prisoner . He deny 'd the Fact , and said , I might search him and welcome . He took his Handkerchief out of his Pocket , and held it in his Hand . I could find nothing . Sure , says I , my Eyes did not deceive me . When presently my Boys told me , they saw the Silver in his Hand . Upon which the Prisoner took it out of his Handkerchief himself , and gave it to me , and said , This is the Bit . He begg 'd that I would not prosecute him , and promis 'd that he would never do so any more . [ This Deposition was by the two Boys . ] Prisoner . Did you see me take it ? Mr. Drury . I saw you take something out of the Basket . Pris . And had you any reason to suspect me before ? Court . He has sworn that he had . P. This was a Plot laid against me . C. Yes , and a good one too . P. Another Man having sent for me to work for him , I was speaking of it in my Master 's Shop , and thereupon , I believe he laid this Trap for me , for he 's a Man of that good Principle , that he would let no Body live but himself . He has trusted me with a great many Ounces of Silver . C. Without Weight or Tale ? Mr. Drury . No . C. Then you were accountable for it . P. I do n't know how it came into my Hankercher ; 't is a Plot ; 't is common to lose 40 or 50 s. a Week , and sometimes my Master has had more Silver than he should have . Mr. Drury . I might sometimes make a Mistake , but it could not always be so . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 23. Elizabeth Stanton , was indicted for stealing a pair of Shoes , value 5 s. the Goods of John Martin , in his Shop , November 1 . Guilty 10 d , [ Transportation . See summary . ] 24. Ebenezer Dun , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of Sarah Loyzada , and stealing 4 Pewter Dishes , a Stew-pan , a Sauce-pan , and a Coffee-pot , Nov. 22 . about the Hour of One in the Night . S. Loyzada . I live in Castle-Yard in Houndsditch . On Tuesday last was a Fortnight , I made my House fast , and went to Bed . The Watch call 'd me up about 1 in the Morning , I found my Kitchen Casement taken off , and miss 'd 4 Pewter Dishes , a Stew-pan , a Sauce-pan , and a Coffee-pot . John Owen , Watchman . I beat my Round at 12 a-Clock , and found all safe at the Prosecutor 's House , and then I return 'd to my Stand , and as I was talking there with my Comrade , a Fellow came up , and ask 'd me to let him have a bit of Candle for a Half-penny ? What to do ? says I . To light me home , says he . So I let him have a bit ; but knowing him to be a loose Chap , and where he liv 'd , I watch 'd him , and saw he went the contrary way . Thinks I , here 's some Roguery in hand , so I and my brother Watchman follow 'd him at a Distance . He turn 'd down Castle-Yard . I left my brother Watchman at the End of the Yard to secure the Passage , and went down softly after the Man . I saw the Casement of the Prosecutor 's Kitchen-window unhung , and presently the Prisoner , and the other Man , came out of the Street-door with the Candle in his Hand . You Rogue you , says I , did I lend you the Candle to do this ? With that he flung the Candle in my Face , and run to the Gate . The Prisoner had this Stew-pan , and this Plate ty 'd before him thus , in this Wrapper . I seiz 'd him , we struggled , and the other Rogue return 'd , and they both beat me , and then they both run away . I follow 'd 'em , and saw the Prisoner turn down Woolpack-Alley , and the other down Angel-Alley , which was a Thorow-fare , and so is Woolpack-Alley in the Day time ; but I had lock 'd up the Door at Night , so that I knew the Prisoner could not get through . I call 'd for help , and we follow 'd him . There 's a Parcel of old ruined Houses and Rubbish in that Alley , where I suppose he hid himself , for we could not find him . But we set a Watch against the End of the Alley , and in about half an Hour he came out , and turn 'd towards Aldgate . Says my Master , There 's a Man come out , is that he ? Yes , says I , this is the very Man that came out of the House with the Stew-pan before him . John Marshal , Constable . Hearing that the Prisoner was run down Woollpack-Alley , I set a Watch at the End , and went to see the House in Castle-Alley which was broke open . When I came back , one said to Owen ; There 's a Man come out , is that he ? Yes , by G - d , says he , that 's the Man ! Prisoner . I was not near the Place when the House was broke open , but I had been at t'other End of the Town , and in my Way home thought to go thro ' Woollpack-Alley , but finding the Door lock 'd , I turn 'd back , when a Watchman cry 'd , Who goes there ?

My acquaintance with her begun by our coming both in one Ship from Scotland . She told me , she was acquainted with great Men , and could do me Service , and expected I should do her some in return . She said , she ow 'd a pretty deal of Money , and knew a way to pay off all her Creditors , which was to leave Goods with me , and pretending she was gone to Scotland , would send them word , that she had left such and such Goods , which if they would take in full for what she ow 'd them , and give me a Discharge they might , otherwise they might get their Money how they could . Thus she sent me to Mr. Hayward , a Wine Merchant , with 15l . tho ' she ow 'd him 70l . He thinking that she was gone to Scotland , and left me to act for her , took the 15 l. in full for the 70 . So she compounded with Mrs. Avery , to whom she ow 'd 20 l. for less than half the Money . It was upon this Account that she desir 'd me to lye in her Room , and if any of her Creditors enquired for her , to tell them , she was gone to Scotland , tho ' it was all a Trick . Before she left me , I told her , I had no Money for Necessaries . She said , I need not want , there were Goods enough in her Closet that I might dispose of upon Occasion , for I had her Keys . F. Naw Sir I last my Keys in my Drawers . P. She trusted the Keys and Goods too , to my Care , for she and I were very familiar , I have lain with her many a Time . F. Upon my Oath he never did , why , does your Loardship think I was lye with such a Jackanapes as he is ? The Goods I trusted him to give to Mr. Hayward and the Brewer , was before I went out of Town . P. Here 's Mr. Grub , the Pawnbroker , will give an Account of her . Grub . I know this Woman by the Name of Hamilton . A Piece of these Goods was pledg 'd with me . I have dealt with her several Times . She has a very indifferent Character . She would cheat or defraud any Body . She brought me false Plate for good , and I lent her 20 l. upon it . F. I own I did ; but you know it was my Lady Cassells , and it is in her Dining-room now ; I was deceiv 'd in it , and so was you . Henry Bovin . Before Justice De Veil she deny 'd that she writ any Letter till he produc 'd it . The Prisoner said , he had been very free with her , and sat up with her many a Night . He was ask 'd hereupon , if he had lain with her ? And he hum 'd and haw 'd , and at last said , No . 1 and 3 or 4 more went to see her Drawers , there was ho Violence done to them . Court . She says they were open 'd with a false Key . Margaret Hunter , again . He was very ill with a Pain in his Ear 4 or 5 Days after she went out of Town . I got him something to eat , and ask 'd him , if he had a Porringer and Spoon ? He said , No , for she had lock 'd up every Thing . - Douglas , again . He told me so , and said , she had left him nothing but dirty Sheets . Mrs. Clark . I lent him a Linnen Towel , and could never get it again . Margaret Forbes . I ask 'd Mrs. Fermer , why she left her Goods to his Care ? She said , she 'd trust him with untold Gold . Mr. De Veil . When he was brought before me , he said several Things that intimated he had lain with her ; upon which I put the Question to him , and he said , that he had not . Prisoner . I said I had not lain in a Bed with her , and did not then say any more , for fear of being prosecuted by her Husband . But I say now , that I have lain with her several Times , and she told me , if her Husband dy 'd , she would have no Man but me . I heard there was a Warrant to take her up for a Cheat . Mr. De Veil . No ; it was only for deluding a young Woman , but she appear 'd , and upon Examination was discharged . P. And she had deluded me too . She 's a Woman of a vile Character ; she brought a Lawyer with her to a Tavern , and he drew up a Confession , and she promis 'd , if I would sign it , that she would not appear against me , but speak to the Jury , and the King in my behalf .

I went with her , and when we came to the End of Pall-Mall , she said she knew where she was , and would not trouble me to go any farther . As I went back , I met a young Man over against the Opera-House . I gave him a little Shove as I past . What 's that for ? says he . No offence , I hope , says I . Who 's that , John Ingram ? says he . The same , says I . And so we fell into Discourse . He had got a Bundle of Things , and told me that his Sister at Chelsea was dead , and had left those odd things to him , and he desired me to take them to my Lodging in Thames-Street : So he gave me the Bundle , and just as I was going , Hold , says he , I have a few other odd Things in my Pocket , you may as well take 'em all together ; and with that he put 2 Silver Spoons into my Breeches Pocket , but what other Things he might thrust in I ca n't tell .

I went and found Mr. Green and the Prisoner Murphey there . He charged her with robbing him . How can you say so ? says she , I never wrong 'd Man , Woman , nor Child ; and if I have any Gold about me it is yours . We searched her , and found 7 Guineas , 5 s. and 6 d. and a Gold Ring in a Housewife in her Pocket : So she was sent to New-Prison . The Man of the Alehouse came to me again about 10 at Night , and said there was a Man at his House who enquired for Mrs. Macloughlane , and he suspected him to be concerned in the same Robbery . I went thither , I found the Prisoner W. M. but he said his Name was John Howard . We sent for Mr. Green , and upon searching him , we found 5 Guineas and a half , 8 s. and an old studded Watch . He seemed to be in Liquor . He was dirty , his Shirt Sleeve was torn , and he said he had been robb 'd of some Guineas . The Coachman who brought him there , said , he had been at Mall Harvey 's . - Davis . I am Watchman to the New River Company . I was at Mr. Chamberlain 's House when Mr. Banford came in , and said there was a Man at the Cow and Calf , who was suspected to belong to the Woman that was taken up there that Day . I went in , and spoke to him in the Irish Brogue ( for I had been a Soldier in Ireland ) . I ask 'd him how he did , where he came from ? He answered me in Irish , and said , he came from the North of Ireland , near Dundee . Sure I should know you , says I : What is your Name ? My Name , says he , is Will . Maclonghlane . I asked him how long he had been in England ? He said he had not been long come from of France . Parlezvous Francois , says I. Ouy Monsieur , says he . I found he could speak so much French as I . Court . 'T is no Matter whether he could or not : The Court do n't want to hear how many Scraps of French and Irish you can repeat . - Davis . So , says I to the Constable , He says his Name is Will . Maclonghlane , and , says the Constable , that 's the Name in the Warrant . With that I kick 'd up his Heels , and he fell against a Jack-Chain . He began to struggle with me ; but You Rogue , says I , if you make any Resistance , I 'll hang you in this Chain , and save Jack Catch the Labour . You have met with the wrong Man , honest Will . Macloughlane ! Then he said his Name was not William Macloughlane , but John Howard , and desired to speak with me aside . I went with him into another Box . Countryman , says he , ( for he took me to be Irish ) I wonder you should be so hard with me , you have got 5 Guineas and a half , and 8 s. 6 d. and a Watch from me ( for I had search 'd him ) . Give me the Gold , and you shall keep the Watch and the Silver if you 'll let me go . Mr. Chamberlain . The Constable came to ask me if I had any Assistance . I bid Davis step out . They went and I followed . They had hold of the Prisoner when I came in . The Constable said he had a Warrant for W. Macloughlane , and then , says the Prisoner , Damn me , if my Name is not John Howard . He desired to speak aside with Davis . Davis beckon 'd to me , and I over-heard the Prisoner say to him , give me the Gold and the Watch , and keep the Silver . He seem 'd to be in Liquor , but sensible . Mary Simons . The Prisoner Murphy came to my House ( the Cow and Calf ) in a Coach . She said , she was ill , and was come to Islington for the Air for a Week or two , and wanted a Lodging . After some time , she ask 'd , If I had any thing to eat ? I told her , no , but I would fetch her something . I went for some Stakes , and when I came back the Constable was there . She said , she had never wrong 'd Man , Woman , or Child , and if she had any Gold about her it was Green 's . Upon search they found 7 Guineas in her Hussy . John Simons . The Prisoner said at first , his Name was Maclonghlane , and afterwards Howard . 5 Guineas and a Half , and some Silver , and a studded Watch were taken from him . He offer 'd Davis the Watch and Silver to let him go . H. Green . They never came back to my House after they went away in the Morning . My House is at the bottom of Parker's-Lane in St. Giles 's . A Woman that knew I had been robb 'd , happen 'd to see Murphy at Islington , and told me of it , and so I came to find her out . Jane Murphy . My Name is not Murphy but Maclonghlane , and this Man is my Husband . Mary Jurick . I saw them marry 'd . Court . When ? Jurick . I ca n't recollect the time , but I think it was on Allbollon-Eve . I and my Husband were at the Wedding . Court . Is your Husband here ? J . No , he did not know of the Trial . Court . Where were they married ? J . At a Lady 's House beyond Red-Lion-Square . I do n't remember the Name of the Street . They supt at our House , and from thence they went to their Lodgings at Mr. Green 's . I live in an Ale-house ; and Green keeps an Ale-house too . C. By whom were they married ? J . By a Roman Priest . They are Roman Catholicks . C. In what Room ? J . In the Garret . Green said the next Morning after the Prisoners were taken , that he would swear any thing to hang them both . Green . I never said any thing like it . Eleanor Coleman . I was in a Neighbour 's House when Green came in , and he swore damn him , he would hang them if there were no more in London . Margaret Sherrit . Green came to Mrs. Jurick 's Room ( in Parker's-lane ) and said he had them both , and would swear any thing to hang them if there were no more in England . Eliz . Soams . I went to Green 's for a Pint of Beer between 8 and 9 in the Morning . A Soldier came down Stairs and call 'd for a Pint of Beer , and paid nothing for it , and then went out . Then the 2 Prisoners came down , and Green said he had lost some Money , and would have them searched ; upon which they were affronted , and threw down a Shilling , and said they would come no more into his House . H. Green . I neither searched them , nor saw them when they went , for I was gone out with my Brother . A . Green . Nor I did not search 'em , for they were gone before I mist the Money . Prisoner . Here 's Isabella Soams can prove that Green has own 'd he was robb 'd by a Soldier . Court . Soams is your Name ? How long have you gone by that Name ? Isabella Eaton . About a 12 Month . Court . I think I have try 'd you here by another Name . Eaton . Very like you might try me , my Lord , and by another Name too ; but what if you did , I was Innocent , and my Jury acquitted me . I never came here for my Crimes , but my Passions . I keep the Two Blue-Posts in the Hay-Market . The Prisoner William Macloughlane us 'd to come to my House with other Gentlemen 's Servants . He left 20 Guineas with me to lay by for him . And that Day as Green was robb 'd , Green came to my House and ask 'd if the Prisoner was there ; no , says I , but he was here Yesterday , and I paid him 16 Guineas . Tell him , says he , next time you see him , I am sorry I affronted him by searching him , for now I understand it was a Soldier that robb 'd me ; and if he 'll let me know where the Soldier is , I 'll give him 5 Guineas . Court . How long is that ago ? Eaton . Six Weeks . Court . How many Weeks is it since the 2d of November . Eaton . I do n't keep an Almanack in my Head . Green . That Soldier is still in my House , and I had no Occasion to give the Prisoner 5 Guineas to find him . Eaton . And says Green , send Billy to me , for if I do n't find the Soldier , right or wrong I 'll hang him . Ann Green . Here 's Moll Harvey , my Lord , stands behind Bell Eaton , and bids her say anything . M. Harvey . No , it is not Moll Harvey my Lord * . * She now goes by the Name of Mackeg or Macguire . Court . Prisoner , Do you call Moll Harvey for a Witness ? W. M. No . Court . Then turn her out . Mary Watson . On the 2d of Nov . I was in Green 's House , and he and his Wife quarrelled , and she struck her Boy , and said , You Rogue , who have you let up ? and the Boy damn 'd and sunk at his Mother , and said , Only a Soldier and two others , that wash 'd themselves above . So then the two Prisoners came down , and Green and his Wife searched them ; I saw it ; Mrs. Green searched her , and he searched him . Green . I was then at Islington with my Brother , to see him out of Town . The Prisoner William Macloughlane call 'd three Witnesses to his Character , who deposed , that he had been a Gentleman 's Servant for some Years past , and had behaved himself honestly . The Jury found him guilty . Death : But acquitted the Woman as being his Wife . 42. William Roberts was indicted for breaking and entring the House of Henry Fry , and stealing 150 Yards of Saggathy , Value 10 l. 90 Yards of Duroy , Value 5 l. 80 Yards of Serge , Value 6 l. and 50 Yards of Kersey , Value 7 l. 10 s. December 1 , about 7 at Night . Henry Fry . I live in Packer 's Court in Coleman-Street . I came home about seven in the Evening , and saw a Man turn into the Court just before me ; but seeing me go up after him , he turned back . I went in , and found the Window of my Warehouse ( which is on a Ground Floor ) open , I knock 'd at the Door , look 'd in at the Window , and saw a parcel of Goods piled up ready to be carried off . Looking farther , I saw the Prisoner in the Room , there is a Lamp faces the Window , I am sure it was he . As soon as he found I saw him , he said , Damn ye , if ye do n't desist and go off , I 'll shoot ye . He stept up to the Window , in order to get out , I laid hold of him there , and pulled him down ; he gave a spring to get from me , but I held him fast ; and after a small Struggle on the Ground , he surrender 'd , and begged me to let him go . I cr'ed out Thieves ; my Wife and Maid came to the Door , and the Neighbours came to my Assistance . One of them went for a Constable , and I did not let the Prisoner go till the Constable came ; and yet when he was carried before Sir William Billers , he denied that he was the Man . After he was secured , I found that a Pane of Glass had been taken out of the Casement , and so it was unhasp 'd . And he had broke 10 or 12 other Panes with struggling , when I pull 'd him out of the Window . Court . Was your Window shut after it was dark ? Fry . My Wife and Maid will give an Account of that , for I went out at Exchange Time , and did not return till about 7 . I had Shutters belonging to that Window , but my Wife having lately lain in , her Maid going away that Evening , and a new Maid coming , the Shutters were left unshut till I came ; none of my Goods were carried off , but were only moved from the Shelves to the Window . Prisoner . Had you no Servants that might mislay these Goods . Fry . I left the Key with my Wife . Prisoner . Did any Body but your selfsee when you laid hold on me first ? Fry . No . Mrs. Fry . My Spouse knocked and cried Thieves . I was frighted , and came down , and when I opened the Door , he had the Prisoner by the Collar ; he begg 'd my Husband to let him go , or to go with him to a Tavern , for he said he had taken nothing . I saw the Casement shut half an hour past 6 , when I came down to let my new Maid in . The Key of the Warehouse was left with me , I left the Goods in their proper Place on the Shelves at half an Hour past 4 that same afternoon ; I double lock 'd the Door , and it was not open 'd again till after the Prisoner was taken , and then I went in , and found several Parcels remov 'd from the Shelves to the Window , ready to be carried away . The Window Board was made like a Table , to turn up and down for shewing Goods ; there was 5 Sagathys of 30 Yards each , 4 Serges , 4 Duroys , of 24 Yards each , and 1 Kersey , besides another Kersey that lay upon the Ground , which I suppose the Prisoner dropt upon his being surpriz 'd . Mary Wilson . I came to Mr. Fry 's Service December first , in the Evening , the Porter who brought my Box , set it down at the Door and went away . There being a Lamp , I looked at the Window , and saw it was safe . My Mistress let me in , and I went directly up Stairs , and look 'd at the Clock , and it was half an Hour past 6 ; before it struck 7 , my Master knock 'd , and cried Thieves ! My Mistress and I went down , and saw my Master have the Prisoner by the Collar . The Casement was open , and a Pane of Glass taken out of it near the Hasp ; so that a Man might put his Hand through and unhasp it , and each Side of the Window was likewise broke . There were Lights brought into the Court ; I saw the Prisoner plainly , and am positive he 's the Man , for my Master held him , I believe , one fourth of an Hour , till the Constable came , and I stay 'd all the while ; I would not swear it if I was not certain , for this is the first Oath I ever took . Court . How came you to observe the Window when you first came ? Wilson . There was a Lamp in the Court , and the Window faces one as one goes up . Prisoner . What Apparel had I on ? Wilson . I think it was a brownish Suit ; you had not that great Coat you have now , nor that Wig . It was not so good a Wig , nor quite so light . Calch Lane . I was called to assist Mr. Fry , who had taken a Thief . I called my Man too , and then went my self for a Constable . Prisoner . What Apparel had I ? Lane . A darkish Coat with a Boot Sleeve , but no great Coat ; and you had , I think , a darkish Wig . Pris . The Maid says it was a light Wig . Court . She said it was not so light as that you have on now . But however , as their Evidence seems a little to vary as to that Particular , the Court will take notice of it to the Jury . Tho . Knight . My Master [ Lane ] called me to assist Mr. Fry ; when I came I saw Mr. Fry have hold of the Prisoner . Pris . What Cloaths had I ? Knight . A dark Boot Sleeve Coat , a dark Wig , and Buck-Skin Breeches . Court . Are you sure that 's the Man at the Bar ? Knight . Yes , I took a Candle , and look 'd in at the Window ( which was open ) and saw several Pieces of Sagathy , Serge Duroy and Kersey lying on the Window Board , and the Print of a Man 's Foot that was wet . There were 7 or 8 Panes of Glass broke , and one Pane was taken out of the Casement . As Mr. Fry held the Prisoner , the Prisoner said to him , Sir , whatever Damage I have done I will pay you for . And Mr. Fry said , I do n't know what Damage is done yet , because I do n't know what is missing , but the Windows are broke . The Prisoner offered to pay for them , and desired Mr. Fry to go with him to a Tavern , or into his own Warehouse , but Mr. Fry refused till the Constable came , my Master being gone to fetch him . Robert Mitchel Constable . I was sent for a little after 7 , and found Mr. Fry holding the Prisoner by the Collar . When the Prisoner was carried before Sir William Billers , his Defence then was , that he went into the Passage to ease himself , and that Mr. Fry finding him there seized him . Prisoner . I had been drinking at the three Mariners in Coloman-street , and having occasion to ease my self , I went under the Arch ; while I was there , two Men came out of the Court , and run by me . The Prosecutor then past me , and went up the Court ; and returning presently asked me what I did there ? I told him I was easing my self . Says he , my Warehouse is robb 'd , and I suppose you are he that did it ; but however , I 'll keep you till you give a good Account of your self . I told him , I would do that willingly , I have a Witness in Court that was by at the same Time . Hannah Malden . Last Night was a Week , as I was going along Coleman-Street , I heard a Disturbance up the Court , and went to see what was the Matter ; there was a Man holding the Prisoner ; the Prisoner said , What do you hold me for ? And the Man said , My Window is open , and I believe you broke it ; but whether you did or did not , I 'll hold you till you give a Character of your self . Then more Mob beside me came up , and they sent for a Constable . The Man had hold of the Prisoner 's Collar ; he held him thus , as I hold this Gentleman . Give me leave , Sir , I wo n't hurt you . Mr. Fry . I neither said these Words , nor any thing of that Nature , for I took the Prisoner in my Warehouse . He offered to give me half a Guinea for breaking my Windows , and said , if I 'd go to a Tavern , or take Coach with him to the other End of the Town , he would make me any Satisfaction . He fell on his Knees , and said he hoped he had not damnified me . I told him I did not know yet what Damage was done besides breaking my Windows . Court . Where do you live ? and what Business do you follow ? [ to Malden . ] Malden . I live in little Moorfields , and go a washing and scouring . I had been at a Dyer 's in the Old Jary , and was going home when I saw this . Juryman . Did you know the Prisoner before ? Malden . No . Jurym . Did he ask you your Name then , and where you liv 'd ? Malden . No . Jurym . How came you then to be an Evidence ? Malden . I went for a Pennyworth of Ashes at a Packer 's in Coleman-street , and there they were a talking about it , and said , he was a good likely young Man , and that he was sent to Newgate . When I came Home , I spoke of him among my Neighbours , and told them what I had heard the Man say to the Prisoner , and they advised me to go to Newgate , and let the young Man know it . Edward Wilcox . I have known the Prisoner 11 or 12 Years , he served his Time with Uncle Pet a Jobbing Smith , and he worked Journey-Work with Mrs. Morris a Smith in Eagle Court in the Strand . I do n't believe any Body can stain his Character . His Name is William Hampton . Mr. Mitchel . He was called up yesterday n + William Green 's Trial , and a Woman swore he was the Man that brought the Goods , that Green was tried for stealing , to Green 's House ; and she said his Name was Hampton . + See the Trial of William Green , above . Mr. Fry . He told the Justice 's Clerk , that he was a Gentleman , and that his Trade was worth 100 a Year to him . He was committed by the Name of Roberts . William Hadley . I have known him two or three Years , he was Prentice to a Smith , and makes Locks , when he has nothing else to do . I worked with him at Mrs. Morris 's , and he lodged with me . Court . What is his Name ? Hadly . I do n't know whether it is Hampton or Roberts ; some call him by one Name , and some by another ; I believe Hampton is a Nickname that People have given him . Elizabeth Morris . He has worked with me 9 or 10 Months , I never knew any thing dishonest by him ; I was amazed to hear he was taken up . His Name is Roberts . Prisoner . I had two Fathers ; my Mother 's first Husband was Roberts , and the second Hampton , and so some call 'd me by one Name , and some by another . Ann Page . I have known him these 5 Years ; he lodged 10 Months at my House in Eagle Court ; my Husband has worked with him at Mrs. Morris 's , when the Prisoner 's Wife came to tell his Mistress , that he was got into Exile . We went to the Alehouse where they were , before he was carried before Sir William Billers , and there I heard the Prosecutor say , that he could not be positive whether he was the Man or no that entred his House , but he met him in the Alley , and being the first Man he found , he would hold him till he brought somebody to his Character . I never knew any Name he had but Roberts , but he came out of some Country , and I believe they gave him a Nickname from that Country . Mr. Mitchel again . I was in company all the time the Prosecutor and Prisoner were at the Alehouse , and I heard no such thing . The Jury found him guilty of the Indictment . Death . 43 , 44. Jane Gale and * Eleanor Walker were indicted for privately stealing 15 s. from Stephen Freeman , November 2 . * Nell Walker was tried in July last , for picking 3 l. out of John Willoughy 's Pocket , vid . Sessions Paper , Numb . 6 . P. 155. Stephen Freeman . I had a Judge 's Warrant against Jane Gale for assaulting me , and threatning to fire my House . My Wife and I had been hunting up and down for her , and at last , between 8 and 9 at Night , we met her at the End of Sheer Lane by Temple Bar . Says I to my Wife , there 's Jane Gale ; Gale turned short , and said , what do you want with Jane Gale ? and so went into a Gin Shop kept by one Jones . I sent my Wife with the Warrant to get a Constable . Then the Gang that uses that House set upon me , and tore me and hal 'd me about like mad ; I warrant you there was twenty or thirty of them seiz 'd me . You Rogue , says one , and you Dog , says the other , I 'll do this , and I 'll do that . Then I saw Jane Gale take 15 s. four Pence halfpenny out of my Pocket , and give it to Nel Walker , and went away . Then I seized Gale , and said , you sha n't go now , till I get a Constable for you . And upon that all the Gang fell abroad on me again , and got her away directly , but my Wife took her in about a quarter of an Hour after , by the Judge 's Warrant . I got a Warrant next Day from Justice Newton , and took Walker . Gale . Did you mention the Robbery that Night ? Freeman . Yes . Ann Freeman . We met Gale as she was turning up Sheer Lane . Says I to my Husband , Stephen ! there 's Jane Gale ! She turned back and said , what do you want with Jane Gale ? so she went into a Brandy Shop , and my Husband sent me with the Warrant , and when I came back , there was a great Uproar , and she run away ; and a Boy told me , that the Woman that had beat and robb 'd my Husband was run up Stairs into Peter Wattle 's Coffee-house . Gale . Freeman met me , and said , Mrs. Gale , I have a Judge 's Warrant . Where is your Tip-staff , says I , to serve it ? I have none , says he . Where 's your Constable then ? says I . Why , says he , I am one ; and with that he pull 'd out a Constable 's Staff . You a Constable ! says I , how came they to make a Foot Soldier a Constable ? so went in to drink at Mrs. Jones 's , and had a Quartern of Liquor ; and he was so far from losing 15 s. that he had not enough to pay the Reckoning ; for when Mrs. Jones asked him for the Money , he said he could not pay till his Wife came , and she afterwards paid for it . He took me into a Tipstaff 's House , and he and his Wife-tore my Gown off my Back , and tumbled me in the Dirt ; and he did not charge me with the Robbery till 5 Days after I was committed . Then the Copy of the Warrant for her Commitment was read . It was for an Assault , without any mention of a Felony , and dated November 6 . Freeman . I was robb 'd on the second of November , and changed her on the third . Court . It 's a little strange , that you who was robb 'd on the second , and got a Warrant on the sixth , should say nothing then of this Robbery , but only charge her with an Assault . Kate Buck . He charged me and my Sister with the same Fact . Court . What Business do you follow ? Kate . I keep a public House in Fleet Lane ; 't is a Brandy Shop . Freeman . She keeps no House , she 's a common Night-walker . Constable . I executed Alderman Billers 's Warrant on Kate Buck for the same Robbery . Then the Warrant was read . It was for apprehending Ann Buck alias Pearse , alias Lewin , and Katherine Buck alias Pember , o't Suspicion of being concern 'd with Jane Gale and Eleanor Walker in stealing 15 s. from Stephen Freeman . Court . It was not for your Credit to produce this Warrant [ to Kate Buck . ] Tho . Stevens . I was at the Castle Alehouse in Sheer Lane , when Freeman brought in Gale , and several more of these Women came with them . There was a great Disturbance and Confusion . I understood he had first carried her to Mr. Davis 's , who would not take Charge of her , because she was not brought by a proper Officer . Freeman said he had a Judge 's Warrant against her for an Assault , but I heard him make no mention of a Robbery . And he having no Authority to detain her , she made her Escape by the help of the Woman who came with her . Kate Buck , she in the red short Cloak there , and her Sister , and the Prisoners too , are pretty well known in this Court . Nan Pearse . Without I am to tell the whole Story from Beginning to Ending , I wo n't say a word . Court . Have not you another Name ? Pearse . Yes , I have had two Husbands , the first is dead , and his Name was Pearse , and I am Buck 's Sister . Nay , you sha n't catch me in a Lie ; I ow 'd Mrs. Jones , the Woman that keeps the Chandler 's Shop , 7 s. 6 d. and so - Court . What do you know of the Prisoners ? Pearse . Freeman brought Jane Gale into the Shop ; he would have had her to a Tavern ; but says she to him , there has been a great Demur betwixt us , because my Husband keeps that Whore Nan Parrot in your House , and therefore I wo n't go with you : And so he called for a Quartern . Court . Do you know any thing of the Robbery ? Pearse . No , but only he charged me with it , and I was discharged by Alderman Billers . - Thorp . Freeman and his Wife came to my House ( the Ship Alehouse in the Old Bailey ) and desired me to go with them to look for Gale . We went to Wind-mill-hill , and from thence to Gale 's Sister 's in Shoe Lane , where we drank to the Tune of half a Crown , and then we and two others went to the Hay-market , and mist of her there to . But coming back by the End of Sheer-Lane , his Wife called to him , and said , Freeman , here the Bitch is . He came up , and damn you , you Bitch , says he , I have catch 'd you now . He had but 15 d. when he went out , and he spent 4 d. at the White-Lion in the Old-Bailey ; and when we came to Gale 's Sister 's , his Wife paid 2s . of the Reckoning , because he had not enough to pay the Whole . And as he was going home , I ask 'd his Wife if he had lost 15 s. Damn him , a Son of a Bitch , says she , who would trust him with 15 s. to get drunk with ? Mrs. Wattle . I keep a Coffee-house in Ship-yard by Temple Bar . I was above Stairs when Gale came running up , and shut me in , and cry 'd , for God-sake hide me . I was frighted . The Constable , and Freeman and his Wife followed . I ask 'd 'em what was the Matter , and if she had robb 'd 'em ? and Mrs. Freeman said no . Several other Witnesses swore that Freeman kept a vile House in White-Fryars ; that he said he knew nothing of the Robbery till next Day ; and that he offered to make it up for 10 Guineas . Freeman swore it was all false , and that they offered him 10 Guineas to make it up . The Jury found the Prisoners Guilty to the Value of 10 d. each . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 45.

Thomas Bonnamy , of Stratford Bow , Distiller , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of Thomas Williamson , and stealing part of the Plush Lining of a Coach , 3 Cassoy Seats , two Feather Beds , 4 Silk Curtains , 12 stuft Curtains , and 17 Glass Bottles , the Goods of Will . Vanute , Nov. 2 . about the Hour of 12 at Night . The Prisoner had bought 17 large Glass Bottles of an old Man that cries old Rags and broken Glass ; and afterwards coming to Williamson 's House , ( in the Neighbourhood ) and seeing some such Bottles there , he ask 'd Williamson 's Brother , for Williamson himself was blind , if he had not lost some such Bottles ; for , says he , I have bought several of the like sort of an old Bottleman , and if you 'll come to my Shop you shall see them , and if they belong to your Brother , I 'll stop the old Fellow next time I see him . Williamson upon this ( having lost several Goods ) got a Search Warrant , and his Brother , with a Constable , went to the Prisoner 's House , where they found some of those Bottles ; and thereupon apprehended the Prisoner for Felony and Burglary . A great Number of Witnesses were sworn in the Prisoner 's Behalf , by whose Evidence it appeared that he was a Person of good Credit and a fair Character . The Jury acquitted him . 80. Joseph Pearson , alias York , ( aged 17 ) was indicted for Assaulting , Ravishing , and carnally knowing Eliz . Long , an Infant of about the Age of 9 Years , Nov. 5 . The Court thinking Eliz . Long too young to be sworn , she was set aside . Ann Long , the Child 's Mother . On Sunday Nov. 5. my Child went up Stairs to play with this other little Girl . The Prisoner was asleep upon the Bed ; they waked him with playing . He got and bolted the Door , and took my Girl by the Hand , and laid her upon the Bed and - Court . You was not present ? Long . No this is what the Child told me . Court . Then you must not go into Particulars , for what another told you is not Evidence . If she told you any thing that gave you Occasion to suspect that the Prisoner had been meddling with her , you may say so in general Terms . Ann Long . I discovered it on the Thursday following by her stradling as she walked : I asked her what was the Matter made her walk so ? She whimper 'd , and said she was afraid to tell me . So I search 'd her and found she was all gaulded , and had a Running of white Matter upon her . Court . Did you observe any Marks of Violence ? Long . I found she had been very much abused . Court . Of what Kind was the Abuse ? Long . Such as if a Man had attempted her - I asked her who did it ? and she said , Jo . York ( the Prisoner . ) I shew 'd her to a Midwife and a Doctor . Lydia Scriven , Midwife . The Child was brought to me by Justice Giffard 's Order ; I found she had been much abused , and that he had had Carnal Knowledge of her . I search 'd her in the same manner as I do a Woman in Travail . Court . Do you think it was in order to have Carnal Knowledge of her ? Midwife . Yes . Court . How can you tell ? Midwife . By the Marks . Her Body was very much bruised and abused , and she had a nasty Running on her , that the Doctors please to think is the foul Disease , and I think so too . John Smith , Apothecary . I was desired to search her . I found a Gleet upon her , and it was foul , and I imagine it to be the foul Disease . Court . Did you find any Marks of Violence ? Smith . I examin 'd no farther than only to observe the Gleet . Court . It may be proper for you to explain what you mean by a Gleet ? Smith . A Running of soul Matter , which I suppose to be of a Venereal Nature . Court . Could that proceed from no other Cause than a Venereal Infection ? Smith . 'T is possible it might . Court . Could it be contracted without an Emissio Seminis on the Part of the Boy ? You understand me ? Smith . Humh ! I believe - it might . Juryman . Was the Boy examin 'd as to his having any Disorder upon him ? Smith . Yes , I found a foul Gleet upon him too ; but I do n't know how it came . Daniel Long . I went to the Prisoner in the Bail Dock Yesterday , and ask 'd him , what he thought of himself ? He said , He was sorry for what he had done , in medling with my Daughter , and I said , I was sorry too . He own 'd it to his Master too . Prisoner . I only said I was sorry that I was sent hither . Edward Kendale , the Prisoner 's Master . I know nothing of the Matter , only my Girl told me , that he had serv 'd her the same Sauce . D. Long . Did he not own it to you ? E. Kendale . He never downright own 'd it ; but he said , he was sorry that such a thing was done , and that he had ever plaid with the Children , for there were 4 of them in the Room at the same time . Prisoner . I never offer 'd to meddle not make with them in my Life ; and there was no Lock nor Bolt to the Door . Kendale . That 's true , there was no Bolt to the Door . Margaret Stevens . Last Sunday I was at Mr. Kendale 's House , and there were these two Girls , Betty Kendale , and Betty Long , and I ask 'd them these Questions , which I will now resolve by the leave - Court . 'T is improper Evidence , because the Girls have not been examin 'd . Stevens . Nay , if I must not speak what I know , I have no more to say , nor the other Witnesses neither . The Jury acquitted him . 81. Thomas West , was indicted for wilful and corrupt Perjury , in an Affidavit made before Sir William Billers . Acquitted . 82. William Parker , was indicted for assaulting Mary , the Wife of Arthur Harding , and breaking his Windows ; and for assaulting James and Richard Bright , to which three Indictments he pleaded Guilty .

Edward Haws , was indicted for defrauding of 8 l. 3 s. by a false Letter ; to which he pleaded Guilty . [ Fine . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] 84. Bartholomew Harnet , * was indicted for wilful and Corrupt Perjury , on his giving Evidence in this Court , against William Holms for a Robbery on the Highway . * See the Trial of William Holms in last Year 's Session-Paper , Numb . VII . Part I. p. 189 . [ The Record was read , and agreed with the Indictment . ] William Plimpton . On the 8th of Sept . last , the Defendant gave Evidence in this Court against one William Holms , who is since dead . Court . Was he sworn in the usual Manner ? Plimpton . Yes . Court . Did you see see him touch the Book ? Plimpton . Yes . Court . For what was he sworn ? Plimpton . As an Evidence against William Holms . Court . What was Holms at that time ? Plimpton . A Prisoner at the Bar . Court . Are you sure the Defendant is the very Person who was then sworn ? Plimpton . Yes . Court . What Evidence did he give ? Plimpton . He swore that as he was coming from a Place call 'd Iron-Gate , by Tower Hill , in his Way as he was going along he lit of this William Holms , and enquir 'd of him the way to Bishopsgate-street . That Holms told him , he was going that way , and he would shew him the way . That accordingly Holms led him to a Place call 'd Upper-Morefields , near the Booth , or the Wooden-house ; that then the Defendant told Holms , that he need not go any farther , for he then knew where he was , and offer 'd Holms a Penny , which he refus 'd ; that then he offer 'd him 2 d. which he likewise refused . That Holms gave a Whistle , and out came a Man unknown to him and clapp 'd a Pistol to his Breast ; that Holms rifled his Pocket , and took out 5 s. and 9 d. in Money , and a Silver Buckle out of his Shoe . C. Is this the Evidence that was given ? P. Yes . C. Was there any thing said as to the Time ? Plimpton . Yes ; when the Evidence was gone thro ' on Holms 's side , the Judge call 'd the Defendant up again . And , says the Judge , Harnet , did you ever see that Holms before ? Yes , says he , once or twice , my Lord . Where ? says my Lord . At the Wrestling . Ring , says he . Then you are sure that 's the Man ? says my Lord . Yes , I am sure , says he , looking at the Prisoner Holms . Court . You was saying something about the Time it was done . Plimpton . The Time was mention 'd to be about 10 at Night , within a Quarter over or under , there or thereabouts ; that 's the Evidence he gave . Court . Will you ask this Witness any Questions ? [ To the Defendant . ] D. I gave my Evidence that it was past 10 . C. Now this is said to be all false , the Perjury is assign 'd that there was no Robbery . Robert Plimpton , Jun . As the Defendant was coming from Iron-Gate , or Tower-Hill - C. You should first inform the Court , on what Occasion he gave his Evidence . R. P. Jun . It was on the Trial of Will . Holms for a Robbery . C. Did you hear the Defendant sworn in that Cause ? P. Jun . Yes . C. And by whom was he sworn ? P. Jun . By the Officer of the Court . C. Did you see him touch the Book ? P. Jun . I ca n't be positive to that . C. What was his Evidence ? P. Jun . He said , that coming from Iron-Gate , he met with William Holms , and ask 'd him the way to Bishopsgate-street . That Holms offer 'd to show him the way , and took him up and down several Streets , which he did not know the Names of , till he brought him to Upper-Morefields . That when they came there , he offer 'd Holms a penny for his Trouble , which he refused . He then offer 'd him Two-pence , and Holms also refused that , and after some Dispute , a little Man came up , and clapp 'd a Pistol to his Breast , and Holms rifled his Pockets , and took 5 s. 0 d. out , and then took one of his Buckles . That he the Defendant said to Holms , they are not Silver , do n't take them ; but that Holms swore they were Silver , and he would have them , but Company coming up he got but one . The Defendant was ask 'd , how he could be sure that Holms was the Person ? and he said , he knew him by the Lights in coming along , and that he had reason to know his Guide . Then he brought Persons to swear what he said when he came home . C. What did he say as to the time of Night ? P. Jun . He swore it was about 10 a-Clock , and I think he said it was the 19th of July last . C. How came you both to recollect so particularly , did you take any Notes ? P. Sen. No , I did not . P. Jun . I did . For Holms , who is now dead , was my Father 's Servant , and being in some Trouble on this Account , he sent for my Father , and we went with him before Justice Garret . He was taken up the Day after the Robbery was said to be done . John Chittham . I was in Court at the time of the Trial , and saw the Defendant sworn in the usual Manner ; I think I saw him touch the Book . He swore , that he ask 'd Holms the way to Bishopsgate-street , that Holms said , he was going that way , and led him to Morefields . That when they came there , he said to Holms , now you may go , for I know my way very well , and then offer 'd him first a Penny , and afterwards Two-pence , both which Holms refus 'd ; and Whistling , a Man came up , and presented a Pistol to him , and Holms rifled his Pocket of 5 s. 9 d. and took a Silver-Buckle out of his Shoe . When he was ask 'd , why Holms did not take the other Buckle ? He said , My Lord , we heard a Noise , and he run one way , and I another . He said , he was positive to the Man , by his black bushy Hair . His Lordship ask 'd him , How he knew ? And he answer 'd , By the Lights as they came along together . Court . What Day did they say it was ? Chittham . To the best of my Knowledge the 19th of July , near or about 10 at Night . Court . Now you may call your Witnesses to prove the Evidence on which Holms was acquitted . James Towers ! What have you to say against the Defendant ? James Towers . I was Father in Law to William Holms deceas 'd . He was try 'd here last Sessions but one , on the Evidence of the Defendant . Court . For what ? Towers . For robbing him in More-fields . C. I would ask all the Witnesses if the Defendant was positive to the Day and Hour ? All . Yes . Towers . On the Day that the Defendant swore the Robbery was committed , which was the 19th of July , as I came from my Work , near Eight at Night , I met William Holms in Bishopsgate-street , at the Corner of Old-Bedlam ; says I , Where are you going , Will ? And says he , To see for you ; Mr. King has got a Shoulder of Mutton , desires you and I , and my Wife and Sister , to come to Supper with him to Night . I did not much care for going , and so I went on towards Holm's-House , which is in Old-Bedlam-Court , and he turned back and went with me . When he came home , he said to his Wife , Sarah ! come prithee get ready , Mr. King 's Supper waits . Says she , Wo n't my Father go ? Will , says I , to oblige you I will , and so he and I went before , about 8 , and his Wife and Sister came after . We stay 'd there with him till 11 . Court . Are you sure he did not go out in all that time ? Towers . I do n't know that he was out of the Room . He might go out to make Water , but I am sure he was not out 5 Minutes . Court . Are you positive that he was not out so long as to go to Upper-Morefields and back again ? Towers . That I am . I went home with him when the Company broke up . His Sister took hold of his Arm , and his Wife of mine . I saw him partly undrest , in order to go to Bed before I left him , and then it was half an Hour past a 11 . Next Day , being the 20th of July , after I had done work , I went to drink a Pint of Beer at an Alehouse in Houndsditch . A Messenger came there , and told me , that my Son Holms was got into Trouble , and was at the Flying-Horse in Morefields . I wonder 'd to hear it , because I knew he was not Quarrelsome ; so I went thither , and found him sitting in a Box . What 's the Matter ? says I . Why , says he , Here 's a Villain accuses me of Robbing him last Night . Robbing him ? says I . Yes , says Holms , and has put a Buckle into my Pocket . Well , says I , we can prove where you was last Night . I 'll go and fetch some of the People that were with us . I went out and met Mr. Plimpton and his Son . Court . What Company had you at Supper at King 's ? Towers . Holms and I went first , as I said , about 8 . His Wife Sarah and his Sister Susan came about 9 . Then there was Thomas King , the Man of the House , and his Wife Giles King , and Johana Maxey . So meeting with Mr. Plimpton , I went back with him to the Flying-Horse , and Holms told him the same Story as he had told me ; that the Villain had charg 'd him with a Robbery , and had put a Buckle in his Pocket . His Master desir 'd they might go before a Justice ; I think 't was Justice Chamberlain 's we went to ; but he was not at home , and going from his Door the Constable and Holms cross 'd Spittle-Yard in order to go to Justice Garret 's , when I observ 'd the Defendant , who was behind them , turn 'd towards Bishopsgate-street , as if he was going off . I ca n't swear that that was his Design ; but I believe he was sorry for what he had done , and was afraid to proceed . But I went behind him , and then he followed them ; and I desired the Constable to take Care of him . The Defendant finding such a favourable Reception at Justice Garret 's , he swore the Robbery , or else I believe he would not have had the Impudence to have done it . Thomas King . William Holms and his Father-in-Law came to my House , on the 19th of July in the Evening : It was a little turn 'd of 8 , and in a little time , about 9 , his Wife and Sister came , and they all staid till 11 at Night , and then all went away together . I do n't know that he went out of the Room till the Company broke up : But I am sure he was not absent so long as to go to Moorfields . I took Notice of the Day of the Month , because next Day he was charged with the Robbery . Defendant . There was no Talk of his Wife being there when you gave your Evidence at his Trial . King . What 's the matter there was not ? Court . You must give him a fair Answer . King . I gave the same Evidence then , and could not say otherwise , for I should have been wrong if I had . Defendant . You gave no Evidence of his Wife then . Court . He swears now positively , that he swore then that they came at different Times . If you can contradict him by other Evidence you may . Defendant . I have no Council . Court . The Court is Council for you . Susan Holms . My Brother William Holms , and his Father , went to Mr. King 's in Petticoat-lane , the 19th of July , about 8 in the Evening , and his Wife and I followed , and it was hardly then 9 . Court . Did you find Holms there ? S. H. Yes , and we all staid till 11 or after , and I believe he never moved from his Seat in all the time . He was not missing a Minute to my Knowledge . Court . Then you are sure he was not absent long enough to go to Moorfields ? S. H. I am positive to that . C. How came you to remember the Day of the Month ? S. H. I took notice of it because he was taken up next Day . C. What had you for Supper ? S. H. A Shoulder of Mutton and Cucumbers . C. What Company supt there ? S. H. Mr. King and his Wife Giles , my Brother Holms and his Father , my Brother 's Wife and I , and Mrs. Maxey [ Maxstead ] ; my Brother and I , and his Wife , and his Father , went home together ; and I saw my Brother and his Wife abed , and I do n't know but they might be asleep before I left him . C. Who is Mrs. Maxey ? S. H. One that lived in the same House where we supt . Def . You gave no Account of her in Holms 's Trial . S. H. She was here then , but there was no Occasion to call her . Giles King . I dress 'd the Supper . Holms and his Father came to my Room between 8 and 9 on the 19th of July , and his Wife and Sister followed , in about half an Hour . He staid all the time . I never saw him go out of the Room ; for I never left the Room my self , but my Husband went out and in to fetch Drink . Sarah Holms . My Husband and - Court . Was Wil . Holms your Husband ? Sarah H. Yes . Court . I believe there will be Proof enough without you , tho ' otherwise ( as your Husband is dead ) I think you might be admitted to give Evidence . But as there seems to be no Occasion for it at present , you had better stand aside a little , for I would not willingly na the least matter of Doubt with unexceptionable Evidence . John Yates . I was drinking at Mr. Hoare 's ( the Constable 's ) at the Flying-horse in Moorfields . The Defendant came and told Mr. Hoare that he had seen a Man at the wrestling Ring who had robb 'd him the Night before . Mr. Hoare call 'd me to assist him . We went out together , and the Defendant told us we should find the Goods upon the Man , and desired us to stand off a little , while he went to the Ring and look 'd for the Man . We staid about a quarter of an Hour , and Mr. Hoare being tired with waiting , sent me to see for the Defendant . The Defendant seeing me coming towards him , came and met me , and said , stay a little , the Man is there , and I see the Buckle upon him . I went back to Mr. Hoare , and presently the Defendant called us , and going up to Holms , he tapt him on the Shoulder , and said , This is the Man . We went to the King 's Head Tavern , and the Defendant bid me search Holms . I search 'd his left Coat Pocket , and found nothing ; but the Constable searching the other , pull 'd out a Buckle : The Defendant presently cry 'd , that 's my Buckle , and here 's the Fellow to it : With that Holms said , then somebody put it in . We went to one Justice , but he was not at home , and so went again to Mr. Hoare 's House , and he charg 'd another Man to take care of Holms . So that I being no farther concerned , did not know when they went before the Justice again . By the Defendant 's saying he saw the Buckle upon him , I thought it had been a Girdle-Buckle , till I saw it was a Shoe-Buckle . Court . Did you see nothing else taken out of Holms 's Pocket ? Yates . Nothing , except it was 2 or 3 Goosberries . Dif . Did I ever tell you that I saw the Buckle upon him ? Yates . Yes , those were your very Words . Def . I had no Discourse with you alone . George Quarrel . I was coming over Moorfields the 19th of July at Night , and about the Middle of the Tenter-ground , I saw the Prisoner standing stock still , and 2 Gentlemen coming by , he ask 'd them what was o'Clock ; they answer 'd him roughly ; and I coming up , told him it had just struck 10 . He said he did not want to know , but only asked for his Fancy . Then he and I walking one Way , he told me he had been robb 'd ; and coming to a House in Long-Lane [ Long-Alley ] he stopt , and told me that was his Lodging , and would needs have me go in . I was afraid he intended to charge me with the Robbery : But however I went in with him . He ask 'd me my Name , and where I liv 'd . I told him , and he set it down . Then he ask 'd if I 'd drink a Dram . I said yes . We had a Quartern , and he put his Hand in his Fob and took out half a Crown and some Shillings and Half-pence , and paid the Reckoning . I was in a sort of a Wonder how that Money escaped ; but he said his Breeches buttoir 'd tight , so that the Man who robb 'd him could not find it . Court . Did he appear under my Confusion ? Quarrel . He seemed to be frighted ? Court . You say he asked what was a Clock , and then told you it was only for his Fancy ; did that look-like one that had been just robb 'd ? Quarrel . I am not so good a Judge of that as your Lordship . Def . Was it proper for me to tell you why I ask 'd ? You told me that I had been at your House with two Women . Quarrel . That was when I came to your Lodging , not when I met you first . Def . Did not you say in Moorfields , that a Fellow rushed after you , and whistled , and that you suspected somebody had been robb 'd ? Quarrel . No . Def . You knew me first when we met . Quar . I never knew you , till I came to your Lodging . Court . Had he been at your House with two Women ? Quar . Yes , a few Days before . Def . I have met with a great deal of Trouble in a strange Place , and it is not to be expected that I should bring Witnesses from Ireland , from whence I lately came , and where my Friends live ; but I have a Certificate here from the Mayor of Cork and other Gentlemen . Court . The Court can not read it ; such Certificates may be procured in a very odd manner . Def . I had no Money to subpoena Witnesses to prove it . Here are nothing but Circumstances against me ; and I declare now , ( tho ' a Man may be mistaken ) that he actually robb 'd me , and I would say the same , if it was my dying Day . The Jury found him guilty . [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] [ Transportation .
