The Prisoner in her Defence pleaded , That nothing was freer than Gift , and the Prosecutor had given her the Money ; that he had before been acquainted with her , and meeting her in Newgate Street , fell into Discourse with her , and ask 'd her to drink a Glass of Wine with him , that she consented , and they went to the Sign of the Dean 's Head in St. Martins le Grand , and being there drinking together , the Prosecutor gave her a Penny to fetch a Penny worth of Rods , and she went to a Chandler 's Shop hard by , and bought Rods , and whipt the Prosecutor with them , till she had worn them quite to the Stumps , that having so done , the Prosecutor gave her the Bag and Money for so obliging of him , and was so well pleas 'd , that had it been twice as much more he would have given her it all ; and also would have had her serch another Penny worth of Rods , for the same Purpose , but because she would not he would have his Money again , but he having given it her , as she often repeated to the Court , Nothing was freer than Gift , refus 'd to do it ; that thereupon he swore he would charge her with robbing him , and hang her . This her darling Maxim , Nothing was freer than Gift , she often repeated , and with more Confidence and Levity , than became one under her dangerous Circumstances ; and as to the Service by which she pretended to merit the Prosetor 's Money , she was call 'd upon to bring Proof of it , either by the Person of the House , or of whom she bought the Rods , but not producing any Evidences , it appear 'd to be but an extravagant Sally , designed to render the Prosecutor ridiculous .
