A Narrative of the Proceedings at the Sessions begun the 13th of December 1676 , at the Oly Bayly . THe first person tried , was for making away her Bastard-childe ; but upon hearing the Evidence , and examination both of the Midwife and Coroner , it appeared tobe onely a Miscarriage ; and by several circumstances there was reason to judge that she had not gone above sixteen weeks , and had never been quick , the abortive Infant being not above eight inches long , and no symptoms of Wounds or Bruises being to be seen , on the body to argue any violence used to it , he Jury thereupon thought fit to bring her in not guilty . A young man was arraigned for Murther , killing an old man in St. James 's Park : Two fellows being running together in the evening the poor ancient man unlukily happen 'd to be in their way , and one of them tumbled him down and bruised him , of which bruise the next day he died ; but the Evidence testifying that it was done meerly by accident , without any grudge or quarrel precedent , and that the Prisoner as soon as he perceived he had done an injury , went immediately and call 'd a Chair to carry him home , & c. There was no reason for finding the Indictment , so that he was discharged . A Servant-maid was found guilty of stealing a silver Tankard of the value of Five pounds : She living at a publick house in the Old Jury , took an opportunity to take it away ; and having knock 'd off the Lid , brought it to a Goldmith to sell , who perceiving the Cover lately broken off , would not buy it , unless she would shew it him ; which after much importunity she did , and upon that was engraven the name of the Owner , whose wife she then pretended to be , and had the Goldsmith to a Confederates house , who seemed to say as much : but at last being trapp 'd in their words by him , she confess 'd the Felony to him , and afterwards on her examination before the Justice , and acknowledg 'd in effect as much now at the bar , onely said that the Tankard was delivered her to sell by a fellow-servant ; but there being neither proof nor probability of any such things , she was convicted . A woman was indicted for burning her Master 's Barns at Harrow on the Hill , in which a considerable parcel of Wheat and other Corn was consumed on Michaelmas day last . Her Master and his wife gave evidence , but nothing of their own knowledge , onely that she had confess 'd the Fact , that in their absence in the evening she took a Fire-brand , and carrying it out of the house put it in at a hole in the Barn amongst a Mow of unthrash 'd Oats , whereby that Barn , and another adjoining were burn 'd down , and the Dwelling house with much difficulty preserved . And this likewise appeared on reading her Examination ; for which mischievous act she could alleadge no other provocation but that her Master would not lend her money to go to a Wedding . However the Justice that committed her , assuring the Court from his personal knowledge , that the Prisoners Father was a very melancholy and distemper 'd man , and that she her self had a defect in her understanding , and many times at least not the use of common Reason or Sense , and the Evidence against her in effect acknowledging as much , which was confirmed by her present stupid carriage at the Bar . The Jury looking upon her as Non Compos Mentis at the time of the Fact committed , could not finde her guilty in the eye of the Law , of the Crime for which she stood indicted . Two Legerdemain Ladies of profound experience in the mysteries of Shoplifting ; one of them having been whipt at the Carts tail but the very last Sessions , were convicted for stealing two pieces of Callicoe , under pretence of buying o kerum . The Goods were taken before they got out of sight in one of their aprons , who alleadged a very civil excuse , assuring the Court that she was drunk with Brandy , and knew not what she did ; but that Plea was overrul 'd , and both of them found guilty . A French Gentleman , came in voluntarily to take a tryal for killing a Marshal 's man 's follower , in April last was two years , at the end of St. Martins-lane . The Marshals man himself was gone another way , and the party kill 'd , and three or four more seiz 'd the Prisoner ( as they suppose it was ; but without having any Warrant at that Instant with them ; and besides , the Warrant their Master had was wrong in the Christian name . Upon their taking the party , divers of his Companions drew their Swords , and one of the Bayliff 's lost his life in the fray ; but the Evidence could not say who kill 'd him , nor positively that the Prisoner at Bar was the person they had arrested : so that he was acquitted both of Murther and Manslaughter . The next was a tedious tryal of a young fellow for breaking open the house of a worthy Gentleman his late Master , and stealing thence a Spanish Gun , and other Goods , to the value of Fourty pound . There appeared several violent presumption of Guilt , and a person where the Gun was found had sworn directly before the Justice , that the Prisoner was the man that sold it ; and another , that he verily believ 'd him to be the man ; but now neither of them would say further , than that he was somewhat like him . The Prisoner had a great number to speak in his behalf , but few could say any thing to the purpose ; and the Court declared themselves sensible of much practice us 'd on the Prisoner 's behalf , to conceal the truth , yet on a full hearing , for want of direct Evidence , the Jury brought him in not guilty . A Flemming born in the City of Antwerp , was indicted on the Statute for exercising the Trade of a Gold beater here , not having served seven years as Apprentice ; but it being prov 'd by several witnessesthat he serv 'd the said term to his Father of the same Trade in the said City of Antwerp , and that he was an excellent Artist . The Court considering the intent of the said Statute , which is onely to prevent unskilful and insufficient Workmen ; and that the Art it self prohibits onely those that have been Apprentices , or not serv 'd as Apprentices : And though he were not Apprentice in England , yet he had serv 'd as an Apprentice abroad ; which they concluded to be within the intent of the Statute : For otherwise it would be too great a discouragement to Foreigners to instruct us in the usual Inventions ; and therefore the Jury found him not guilty . An old Offender was convicted for stealing a bay Gelding of Six pound price , a quarter of grownd Mault and two Sacks : the Horse was taken out of the stable on the 28th of Nov. and the two sacks of Mault with it . The very next day the Owner coming to London met the Prisoner driving his Horse along St. Gileses 's , with one of the Sacks empty on his arm , and there seiz 'd him , who now pretended that the Sack was given him by two strangers , he knew not who , for his pains to drive the Horse along Tyburn road , but he knew not whether ; and therefore seeming onely a forged excuse , without any proof to confirm it , he was found guilty , it being averr 'd in Court that he had three times already been burnt in the hand and convicted . Two persons , one by his own Confession , and the other by Verdidict , were Convicted for stealing a silver Tankard in the Woolstaple Westminster , from a publique house , whence at once they stole away themselves , the Plate and the Reckoning , but were discovered by a Female Crony , upon a disgust , that she was not allowed Snips in the prise , & c. A Woman as principal , and a Man as accessary , were Convicted for stealing Plate , and other rich goods , to the value of 200 pound from a Frenchman at Westminster ; whose servant the woman being , took the opportunity of his absence , and ransackt several of his Rooms , and stole the said goods , After which the said other prisoner took her a Lodging , disposed of a Watch , and some of the Plate ; for which both were found Guilty . A Lighterman and his Wife were Arraigned , for stealing of about 40 pieces of Serge , out of a Lighter on the Thames ; The Prosecutor produced several witnesses , and one very roundly swore , that she saw two of the pieces of Serge in the Prisoners house in the Cradle , and that his wife seemed much afraid of a search ; and threatned to fling them into the house of office , & c. But upon a full examination , it appearing that there had been several suits and brangles between the parties , that the Prisoner was sick at the time of the Robbery , that it was two years ago , and no prosecution all this while , that the husband prisoner was a person of good Fame , & c. They were both acquitted by the Jury . There was great expectation of the Tryal of one Lodowick Muggleton , for spreading detestable opinions , and publishing several impious Books ; But the same was put off , till witnesses might be ready for a full discovery of his Villanies , and therefore the reader is to take notice , that any Pamphlets published concerning his Tryal , are faigned stories . There were tenn burnt in the hand , seven allowed Transportation , ten to be whipt , and one to stand in the Pillory .
