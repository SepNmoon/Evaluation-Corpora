Jennings alleaged several desperate Treasons against him : as , that he told them . He was one that was to seise the King at Oxford : and , that unlese he would comply with his Parliament , there would be ready thousands to secure him : And , that he was prepared with Armor for that purpose , which he shew 'd them , & c. The Evidence was long , and full of weight : So that the Jury received the Bill ; after Dinner return 'd it Ignoramus . And at the same time presented a Petition , subscribed , to the Court . That whereas they were informed , That several Priests and Jesuites that lay under Sentence of condemnation , did dayly Plot and contrive by sundry Means to work out their Deliverance , and that by Commission from Rome , they sate and consulted the Destruction of the Protestants , by forging diversand sundry devices against them , wherefore they prayed . That they might either be removed far from this City , or other means taken to secure them from such like attempts for the future , which Petition ; the Court received , and order 'd to be Read , My Lord Chief Justice promising to acquaint his Majesty with their Prayers . Motion being made by Mr. Williams , late Speaker of the House of Commons . That the Right Honorable the Earl of Shaftsbury might be bailed by reason there was no Prosecution entred against him : there being several worthy Peers offered to engage for him . My Lord Chief Justice told him , That nor only himself , but 9 more of the Judges , foreseeing they would make a Motion , had consulted the Matter and were all of Opinion . It was not in their Power to deliver his Lordship : The Tower not being within the Limits of that Commission they sat by : but if it had been Term-time , he might have been removed to the Kings-bench-Bar and there relieved .
