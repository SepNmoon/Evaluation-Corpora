A Further Account of the Procedings OF THE King 's Commission of the Peace , Held at Justice-Hall in the Old-Bailey . Setting forth the Tryals of William Pheasant , for a Rape ; Mary Poole , a Gypsie ; and Rebecca Petty , alias Adams , alias Jones ; With divers others . The Proceedings were these : William Pheasant , of the Parish of St. Gabriel Fanchurch , in the Ward of Langborne , was Indicted for Feloniously Committing a Rape on the 20th of October last , on the Body of Deborah Wise a Virgin , under the Age of Ten Years , in a certain House of Easement , belonging to the Dwelling House of Jane Evans . The Evidence for the King said , that she did find some Symptoms on the Childs Shirt , three several times , upon which she was much frightned , and sent for her Nurse , and desired her to search , the Childs Body , and Examine her about it , which she did , and said that she found the Childs Body in great Disorder , and did suppose , that the Child had been abused by some Man , with that she strictly examined her , who it was that did it : The Child at the first seemed unwilling to tell who it was , but pressing her hard , she confest , that it was a Gentleman that came to the Dancing-School . Then the Child was called , and being set up , was ask 'd if she knew the Danger of taking a false Oath , and she replied Yes , that if she did not swear true she must go to Hell , upon which she was sworn : Being ask 'd if she knew the Man that did it , she replied Yes ; then she was bad to point to him , upon which she pointed to the Prisoner two several times , he being set in two several places , and said that he was the Man , and that she saw him in the House of Office , and he called to her , and she came to him , and he bolted the Door upon her , and gave her a Penny to let him do what he would to her ; and said he set her upon the Seat , and put something hard into her Belly ; which made her cry out , and he stopped her Mouth with his Hand : When he had done , he made her promise not to tell any Body of it : She said , that the second time he beckoned her out , and she came down , and did as he had done before , promising her a Silver Box , and some Silver Pennies , but gave her none ; and said , that at the third time he gave her Sugar Candy and Oranges ; they called a Midwife , and an Anatomical Doctor were called , who all deposed , that the Child had been very much abused , and had lost her Virginity , and instanced divers reasons for it . The Prisoner denied the Fact , saying , that he knew nothing of what was objected against him , and called divers Witnesses , to make the contrary appear ; who had taken Dimensions of the House of Office , who all declared that it was so little that it was impossible that any such Act could be committed there . He likewise called divers worthy Gentlemen to his Reputation , who all declared that he was always known to be a very civil young Gentleman . My Modesty causes me to forbear nominating all the filthy and obscene Discourse which was used upon the Tryal , which lasted very long , from between Nine and Ten in the Forenoon , till Five in the Evening ; all which time the Court was crowded by a Multitude of People , among whom was a great many Women ; who , though ordered to depart , would not stir till the Tryal was over , which being done , the Jury went out , and after some time they brought him in Guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] Mary Poole , a Gypsie , of the Parish of St. Giles in the Fields , was Indicted for Feloniously stealing Seven Pounds Ten Shillings in Monies Numbred , from Richard Walburton , on the Twelfth of January last . Walburton said , that the Prisoner came to Powis-Hall , near Lincolns-Inn-Fields , and knock 'd at the Door ; he opening it , she desired him to cross her hand with some Silver , which he did with a Six-pence ; then she told him , thatsome of the Servants had a mind to put him out of his place , upon which he seemed to be something concerned . However to encourage him , she desired him to let her have the Six-pence , and she would bring it him again within an Hour , and she would put him in a good way of living , and tell him more ; with much Perswasions of her Canting Dialect , he let her have it ; then she told him , he must get all his Monies together , against she came , which he did . At the time appointed she came again , and delivering the Six pence , she observed into what Pocket he put it , and immediately conjectured the Money to be there ; Then she asked him if he had any Gold , he showed her some ; she took it in her hand , and gave it a fill-up , and 't was gone , but at length she gave it him again ; he put it into his Pocket as before , She showed him some Juggling Tricks , till she had Juggled away his Money ; Then she wanted to be gone ; and told him , that some People that lived there formerly had hid some Treasure in such a place under the Earth , and if he would go , he should immediately find it ; upon which he went to search for his supposed Treasure ; in the mean while the Prisoner was gone . Another Gentleman that happened to be in the Court , said , that some time since , the Prisoner was telling his Daughter some Story , who had a little Money lying by her upon the Counter ; he mistrusted that she would cheat his Daughter of it , and was resolved to prevent it , and took it up and held it in his Hand ; but the Prisoner seeing that , desired him to cross her hand with a piece of Silver , which he did , and said , that on a sudden the Money was gone out of his Hand , which put him in such a Consternation , that he had not power to cry out or stop her , but let her go away with the Money . Another Gentleman said , that about seven Years since , he was Riding on a Hand-Gallop , upon Sutors-Hill , between Graves-end and Rochester he met the Prisoner ; she said , that for all he rode so fast , he was but going a Wenching , and she would soon over take him ; with that he turned back and gave her a Cut with his Whip , and Rode away as fast as he could , but had not gone Forty yards from her , but his Horse fell down , and she overtook him ; with that he said , he thought she was a Witch , and had bewitched him and his Horse . There was divers other People who said they had been Juggled out of their Money by her . She had little to say for her self , the Jury found her Guilty . [ Branding .

The Reverend Mr. Allen , now Ordinary , thinks fit to acquaint the World , to prevent their being imposed upon for the future , that they are utterly false , and that no true Account of the Condemned Prisoners Behaviour , Confessions , and last Dying Speeches can be given , till next day Eleven of the Clock , which is Attested under his Hand ; and constantly printed for E.
