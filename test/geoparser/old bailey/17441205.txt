And Ann Butler for receiving the same , knowing it to be stolen . Thomas Audrey . On Monday was three weeks as I was going from St. Giles 's pound to Clerkenwell , the prisoner , who had followed me from a house where I had been , hugged me round the neck and insisted I should stay with her all night . I told her I had an honest wife of my own , and I would not stay in any shape ; then she pulled me down an entry where she lodged , but I would not go in with her ; then I missed my watch , which I am certain I had when I went into her company : I took hold of her and kept her in the street above an hour till I could get a Watchman to take care of her ; she said I should have my watch again : the prisoner carried me to her house in Brown 's Gardens . - I went with her because she promised me my watch . She said I should have my watch again next morning . - I am a Drum-major in Colonel Haughton 's Company at Gibraltar , and an lately come from thence . I offered to spend 10 s. if she would let me have it , rather than cause any uneasiness between me and my wife , but she would not let me have it ; the next morning about 10 or 11 o'clock she was charged , and when she was in the Constable 's hands , she owned she took the watch from me : Ann Butler had the watch in her custody . Q . How did Ann Butler , say she came by the watch ? Audrey . She said she had it from the thief that stole it from me . Philpot said before the Justice she did not take the watch by way of designing to keep it , but seeing me in liquor she took it with a design to return it the next morning - She never denied the having it from first to last , and said , I should have it again . Philpot . Mr. Audrey was at Mr. Dun bar's 's in St. Giles 's , and a person came in , and said that my cousin was come to England , and would be glad to see me . Q . Is she any relation to you ? Audrey . A great way off . Q . Is she any Kin to you ? Audrey . She is no kin at all , I believe , but she pretend to be so . William Barron . On the 13th of November , about 11 or 12 at noon , I was going into St. Giles 's with a friend , and in Brown 's Gardens the back of Monmouth-street , Jane Philpot and Butler were quarrelling ( Butler lives in a sort of a rag shed ) about a watch ; Jane Philpot came to demand the watch , and Butler would not let her have it ; Butler said , I will deliver the watch into any of these Gentlemens hands , but I will not give it to you , for you are a thief ; and Jane Philpot said she had it of a man she met in the street , and lent him half a crown upon it ; I said it was a very unreasonable thing to suppose that she should lend half a crown upon a watch ; and then she owned she took it from a man in the street , and if Butler would let her have it again , she would return it to the man , and make matters easy . Q . Did she say she took it with a design to return it ? Barron . I did not hear that , she owned she took it out of his pocket ; Butler said she would deliver it to any one of us , and we advised her to go into the George , and deliver it to the man of the house ; a constable was fetched , and Butler delivered the watch into his hand : when Philpot came before the Justice , she was very impudent . Butler said , she did not design to keep it . Philpot . Did you hear me say I stole the watch ? Barron . You said you picked his pocket of it , and that you would carry it to him again , and make it up with him . Christopher Audrey . The Prisoners came next morning to me at Mr. Dunbar 's , and Philpot said , I have got your brother 's watch , but I did not take it with a design to keep it , but to return it again - she came voluntarily . Butler was very sulky , and said but little . Philpot said to Butler , Deliver the watch to the gentleman of the house ; but she would not deliver it . And Philpot said , Hussy , you have got the watch , deliver it . Said Jane , Christopher , do n't let Ann Butler go , but keep her till you have got the watch ; and as Philpot came voluntarily to me , I think it shewed she had no design of keeping it - we are related to Philpot at a distance . I have known her from her birth , and I never heard her to be suspected of any theft . Prisoner . I went to see my cousin Tom , as he had been abroad a great while , and he was glad to see me , and asked me to drink with him when he was going away . I saw he was very much in liquor , and I desired him to leave his watch with Mr. Dunbar ; but he would not leave it . And I said , Tommy , we will have another pot of beer ; he said , he had no money . Said I , I 'll go and pawn your watch for a trifle ; for I was willing to get it from him , for fear he should lose it , as the times were very dubious . I took the watch and gave it to Butler . Next morning I went to her , and desired a quartern of gin , and asked her what she had done with the watch . She said she had pawned it . I went to Kit Audrey , and desired him to go with me to Butler 's , to get his brother 's watch ; but she would not deliver it . Q Did Philpot desire you to leave your watch with Mr. Dunbar ? Prosecutor . Yes , she did . I was pretty much in liquor . Acquitted . 3.

As the prisoners were going by Mr. Mallard 's house , Leekey saw some linen standing in a basket close by the window , called us back and shewed us the window , he lifted up the sash , took down the blind and went in at the window , took the linen out of the basket , tied it up in his apron , and handed it out to Robinson ; I was on the other side of the way upon the watch ; he came out at the window again ; he said he would have opened the parlour door , and have come out at the street door , but there was a dog barking , and he was afraid he should disturb the house ; then we went to Elizabeth Cane 's ; she went likewise by the names of Lawrence and Lomax .

Mr. Gibb , at Hick's-hall , said he would not be sworn upon a book ; that he was a Scotchman , and it was a matter of conscience to him , and desired to be sworn by holding up his hand , but the Grand Jury would not agree to it , so his name was scratched off the bill . One night , I ca n't tell when it was , within these 5 or 6 months , the prisoner and I went to Mr. Gibb 's , and finding the door upon the latch , we opened it , and went in , forced open the parlour door , and brought several things out of the house , there were gowns , a pair of stays , a pair of silver laced shoes , and several other things ; we carried them to this Elizabeth Cane , she looked them over , and gave us 50 s. for them . - I believe we asked her about 4 l. but we were always willing to ask her enough , because we knew she would give us little enough : she has been endeavouring , since I have been in prison , to stifle my evidence . Q . How long is it since this was done ? Uptabake . About 6 or 7 months , but I ca n't tell the day of the month or week . - I know it was between 9 and 10 o'clock , it was pretty dark .

There were about three or four pounds in money , chiefly in gold , most of it were half guineas ; there were rings , a snuff-box , and several things I ca n't remember . Leekey .

Humphry Collison . On the 16th of October , between eight and nine at night , as I was going along Bedford-Row , I met three young men - I can not be positive that the Prisoner is one of them . And just by the King 's Road one of them , which it was I ca n't tell , got hold of my mouth , and forced my jaw open , and got hold of my tongue , that I was not capable of speaking ; and one of them blinded my eyes with his hand , that I could not see ; one of them put his hand into my breeches pocket , and took out three or four keys ; and then somebody said , D - n him , or G - d - n him , bit him on the head ; and one of them did hit me on the head ; and then they espied this parcel , and struck me upon the hand , and beat it out of my hand upon the paved stones . Q . What makes you think the Prisoner was one ? Collison . At the first sight of him , I took him to be one ; but I ca n't swear to him . I believe this is the trunk : this key in particular I can swear was taken from me at that time . Q . When did you hear of the Prisoner 's being taken up ? Collison . I heard it the Friday morning following . I was sent for to Justice Fraser 's . Joseph Waters . Edward Gascoign , John Hill , and I , robbed Collison of these things about nine o'clock at night - it was done at the upper end of the King 's Road , by Red-lion-street .

When I was before Justice Fraser , I sent for the things , and she delivered them up directly . Q . How long have you been acquainted with the Prisoner ? Waters . About two years - we did not live together - Gascoign brought me acquainted with him , and we used to meet at Gascoign 's house in Jack Adams 's Alley ( I think it is . ) Gascoign was brought up near me almost all his life-time . Q . Where had the Prisoner , Gascoign , and you been that night ? Waters . We had been upon other things , to see if we could get any thing : after I had left these things at Saffron-hill , we went to an alehouse . Q . How had you money ? Waters . I had a great quantity of money - I deal in hard ware , and keep a house in Hare-street , in Cold-bath-fields ; and these fellows used to say , if I did not give them money , or go along with them , they would hang me ; and when I heard that John Hill was taken up , I voluntarily surrendered myself , and gave an information ; and I would have done it sooner , only these rouges would not let me alone . Q . Who did you surrender yourself to ? Waters . To one Quaite . - I believe he is a bailiff . Q . How came you to think , that he was a proper person to surrender yourself to ? Waters . Because he took Hill . Q . Then Hill 's being taken , frightened you ? Waters . No , I was not at all afraid , for if Hill had not been taken , I would have surrendered my self that night . Q . But that made you go and do it directly , did it not ? Waters . It did , Sir . - Prestage . These are my property , I sent my servant with them that night to one Mr. Peacock 's . Miles Carrol . I took John Hill about twelve o'clock at night . - I was sent for to Justice Fraser 's to take Hill into custody , for I did not take him up ; Hill was there . Hill acknowledged Waters , Gascoign , and himself to be guilty of several robberies ; - ( this was the night before Waters made the discovery ) and Hill desired the constable to intercede with the Justice , that he might be admitted the evidence , and he promised that he would make an ample discovery ; I carried Hill to the Gatehouse about eight o'clock in the morning . After that Waters was brought to me , and he begg 'd that he might be admitted the Evidence .

I listened and heard her feet go cross the room : I went up stairs , and saw the door on a jar . I was afraid of going in for fear there should have been men with their cutlasses . I went to the door , and she bounced out upon me - I know her from one of an hundred , a brazen faced jade : I laid hold of her , and it came off in my hand ; I laid hold of her another time , and a second piece came off ; I hold of her a third time , and she got away : I went after her , and cried out , Stop Thief . and she was taken in the alley .

On the 25th of Oct. last , I sent the Prisoner out with some empty casks to an inn ; while he was gone , I was getting another parcel ready , and looking for some old Ropes in a lumber hole , I found a parcel of tea in three papers , the whole about a pound and half ; I shewed the tea to my master , and said I had found a hoard of somebody 's , but God knows whose it was : my master bid me put a private mark upon it , and I put R W and a little cross between , and put it in the same position as I found it , and watched to see who took it away ; It was not moved that day , but the next day I was looking through a sash-window , and saw the Prisoner come out with a candle from behind a partition , and set the candle upon the counter , and went behind the partition again ; I thought he was going to make off with what he had , and presently I heard the door go , and went in pursuit of the prisoner , and caught him with this bag in his hand , and brought him back . There were in the bag , three men 's hats , three papers of tea and a hard brush ; the hats were marked with my master 's mark , and the tea had the marks I put upon the papers ; the Prisoner owned the thing , begged pardon , and said it was the first time . Nathaniel Perne These things were found in a lumber hole ; my master ordered me to go down to take an account of the marks that were upon the papers , which he had ordered to be put upon them ; as to the hat , they were my own marking : the prisoner confessed he took them out of a press , close to his bed-side .

Nov. 25 . Richard Artwell . Last sunday was sevennight in the forenoon , I went on the other side of the water , and dined at the glass-house , and came with a boat load of people and landed at Black Friers ; between 9 and 10 o'Clock I came up Shoe-Lane , and coming up Shoe-Lane whether these people struck me down , or whether I fell down God knows , when I was down I was attacked by three women , the Prisoners at the bar , and several more women fell upon me ; they opened my coat and waistcoat and took my stock off my neck , and I was almost throtled by them . Q . How do you know it was those two women ? Artwell . I took one of them directly - the farthest of the two [ Jackson , ] I do n't know their names , how should I know their names ? this gentleman [ Mr. Capel ] came and knocked them off me , with his stick . Q . Could you see so as to distinguish who they were ? Artwell . How should I see when I was throtled ? Q . How many women did you see ? Artwell . I did not see any women till I was down , to my knowledge . Q . Did you see nobody ? Artwell . Not that I know of . Q . You seem to come in jest : was you in Liquor ? Artwell .

Was the stock and stock buckle you lost taken off from your neck , or was it lost in the bustle ? Artwell . No it was taken away from me , and I took one of them up directly , and my collar was open . Q. Shoe-lane is a dark place , and it was a very dark night . Artwell . It was a very dark place to me . Q . Was it a moon-shining night , or what sort of a night was it ? Artwell . It was light enough for me to know them - I am a pipemaker , I live in Liquorpond Street . Q . You say you are sure to one of the women , how do you know the other ? Artwell . By her face . I must certainly see her face , when she was upon me ; how could I see any body 's face in this court ? Coun . I should be glad to know what time you went on the other side of the water ? Artwell . About nine in the morning . Q . And you staid till nine at night ? Artwell . Yes - I drank beer in the morning . I ca n't tell how much , for there were two or three in company at a publick house . Coun . It is very likely then that you should be sober , and be drinking all that time . Q . Did you see the Prisoners before you were knock 'd down , or after ? Artwell . It was after : I can show you my arms that they are black and blue now . Samuel Capel . As I was coming down Fleet-street , by the end of Shoe-lane , I heard this man cry out , I am robbed , I am robbed , I am murdered . I went to his assistance , and there were three women upon him ; two of them run away , and Williamson stood by with the stock and stock-buckle in her hand - I will swear she is the person who had the stock and stock buckle in her hand . Q . Did she give you the stock ? Capel . No , she had the stock in her hand , and the buckle dropped out of the stock in the lane . Q . Do you know Artwell ? Capel . I never saw him before in my life . Q . What did Williamson do to him ? Capel . I never saw Williamson touch him ; then she went into her sister 's - she went into one of those houses just by , and she said she picked the stock and stock-buckle up , and that the Prosecutor was a friend and an acquaintance of hers . Q . Did Williamson offer to give him the stock again ? Capel . Yes , and he would not take it . Q . Did you say there were two women upon him ? Capel . There was only one woman upon him , another stood by , and the third run away . Richard Abel . And please your honour ; at the usual time of our coming out , which is between nine and ten o'clock , I went to the watchhouse ; I saw there was an uproar ; I went in , and there was Sarah Jackson , and Mr. Artwell gave me charge of her for robbing him of his stock and buckle . I asked him , whether he was sure of this . He said , he was sure of it , for he brought her in by the hand , and the watchman said , he brought Jackson in . I asked Jackson who was concerned with her , and she mentioned Williamson . Said I to our houseman , she belongs to a house of ill same ; go and see if you can find her : for she goes by the name of Moll Perkins , though she often answers to the name of Willia mson . As soon as she came in , this countryman [ Capel ] and Mr. Artwell said , this is the woman that was upon him . Q . Do you know Williamson ? Abel . I know her , as being the sister of Mrs. Horne , and that she did live in Liquorpond Street . Mr. Capel said , there were several women upon Artwell , and that he knocked three of them off with his stick . Q . How do you know she goes by the name of Perkins ? Abel . Only as I am told . Q . Did you ever know her before to go by the name of Moll Perkins ? Abel . No , nor by the name of Elizabeth Williamson - the watchman told me her name was Moll Perkins , and that she sells hearts and livers about streets for her living . I bid the beadle ask Jackson who was concerned with her , and she gave him the names of two persons . William Stanton . I have the honour of being one of the Ward Beadles to Alderman Hoare ; it was my night to set the watch : when I came to the watchhouse , I found it exceeding full , and Jackson was there . The Constable upon some demur made a mistake in the name , because she never went by the name of Mary Perkins , but her sister went by that name . I asked the Prosecutor what charge he gave . He said , A street robbery . But he was so drunk , that he could not tell any thing at all of the matter ; it was impossible for him to know her again . I attended the Constable the next day before the sitting Alderman , and Mr. Artwell swore hard against the Prisoners . I said to Sarah Jackson , consider what you are going to do , and tell us whether Williamson was along with you , and she mentioned the two following names , which I wrote down in this manner , viz . Sarah Jackson says , that Jane Norbury and Pat Bristow , alias Little Pat , were along with her ; and then Jackson declared that Williamson was not concerned . Q . Was the stock produced in the watchhouse before Elizabeth Williamson was brought there ? Stanton . I ca n't tell the circumstances ; I 'll bring a person who will speak more to the matter than I can . Rayment Large , ( a Watchman . ) Mr. Artwell came very drunk into the watchhouse with a young woman , and swore she had robbed him of his stock ; and she said , look into your bosom , and see if it is not there ; and she put her hand into his bosom , and drew the stock out . Q . Was the stock produced in the watchhouse before Williamson was brought in , or afterwards ? Large . It was before : I am sure it was . The stock and buckle are not worth six pence ; it is only a brass buckle . Q. to Stanton . Did you say you knew Williamson ? Stanton . I have known her twelve or fourteen years . She has been a hard working girl all that time : hay , I may say twenty years . Selling in the morning livers and lights , and in the evening sheeps-heads . And as I have been a Beadle five years , I must have known her , if she had been upon the loose order . Richard Boston . I have known Williamson near thirty years , almost from her birth , and I never heard any thing but what was good of her ; she sells livers and lights about 11 o'clock , and baked heads in the evening .

Q . How do you know the Prisoner was one of them ? Welldy . I took particular notice of his feet , for he is lame ; I know he is the person , for he held me by the collar , the moon shone , and the lamps were lighted , - it was by the lamps facing Bethlehem-gate , close to the rails ; when he was taken the other day , I was sent for by the constable , and I said I had been abused and robbed , but I did not mind the money so much as being abused . Q . How do you know he is the very man ? Welldy . He had a long reddish beard on then , he is the man that held me . Prisoner . I desire that Mr. Lloyd , the man that took me last Sunday , may not be present while the other witnesses are examining . [ Mr. Lloyd was ordered to withdraw . ] Prisoner .

Mr. Welldy was in company with two or three more , and owned that he had been robbed in Moorfields ; there were two men who knew the Prisoner very well , came to me , and said they believed they knew where he was to be found ; that he used to be about St. Paul 's Church-yard , and under Newgate , and last Sunday night I took him under Newgate .

No , I said I was going to pay a little money , I did not say how much - I paid three pence for the beer : when the beer was drank , my cousin and I came out of the house , and the Prisoner followed us out ; my cousin parted with me at Paddington , and then returned to London : when my cousin parted from me , the Prisoner insisted upon seeing me safe to Kilbourn ; I made answer , and said , I knew my way perfectly well , and wanted no company , but he would go with me , and in the third field he began to be rude with me . Q . How far is that from the highway ? Harvey . I ca n't tell , 't is in the Fields . Q . What distance is it from the highway ? Harvey . 'T is a considerable distance . Q . Tell me what he said or did ? Harvey . He robbed me of my box and sixteen Shillings . Q . How did he do it ? Harvey . He put his hand into my pocket and took the money out . Q . Did he say anything to you ? Harvey . No , he said nothing . Q . Did he say nothing to you ? Harvey . He said he must have my money . Q . You said he began to be rude with you , do you think it was for lewdness , or what ? Harvey . For lewdness . Q . Did you think he would have robbed you then ? Harvey . No , I did not , but after he had used me so , he robbed me . Q . Did he use you as a lewd fellow , with a design to debauch you ? Harvey . That was what he did at first , and then he took my money ; I run after him , and desired he would give me the money , for it was not my own ; and I was only entrusted to pay it - it was Mr. Dean 's money . Q . Then you did not cry out thief . You thought he designed to rob you of your virtue , rather than your money ? Harvey . I thought so at first . Q . Had he any pistol ? Harvey . He had not any pistol or stick . Q . Nor put you into any fear , did he ? Harvey . No , no otherwise than being rude . Q . What did he do to you ? Harvey . He threw me down to be rude with me . Thomas Littlewood . On the 17th of Sept . I saw the Prisoner follow this woman into the key and garter , and she called for a pot of beer . Q . Did the Prisoner drink with her ? Littlewood . Yes , he did - he took the pot and drank , I ca n't tell what share he had . Q . Did he appear to be an acquaintance ? Littlewood . No , she said she was going as far as Kilbourn , and he said , if she would accept of his company , he would see her safe there . I have not told you how I came to know the Prisoner : I happened to be at another place , and he was quarrelling with another person , and the landlady said she would not let him have any more than one pot of beer , for he looked like a thief , and she did not let him have any more , her name is Blaker . Robert Berridge . I am a constable ; on the 17th of Sept. one Blaker came to me to let me know , there had been a robbery committed , and wanted not to take the man ; he said Mr. Littlewood knew him very well , and that he was a fighting man , and was at the fighting booth , and there I saw him ; some people said it was an improper place to take him , for he would be rescued : I said the best way will be , to take him when the fight is over , for I will not spoil the gentlemen 's diversion , nor spoil the house . Littlewood shewed me the Prisoner , I said let them part the money first ; then the Prisoner came into the room : Mr. Blaker and Mr. Littlewood said he was the man , and some of them thought it dangerous to take him then . The Prisoner run away , and the man that keeps the booth said , push ; Littlewood and some others ran , but the Prisoner run so fast that they could not take him . I heard he lived in Wych-street , and I took him about three weeks after : I think it was on the 25th of October . Is not that Crispin 's day , my Lord ? William Rawhole . My Lord , I am going to speak , and I hope you will not let any body interrupt me . On the 25th of October , I think it was Crispin's-day , I was at Mr. Bird 's , and he said the Prisoner was at Mr. Broughton 's booth , and asked me , if I knew him . I said , I did know him , but he was not there . We went to his room , and there we took him . When he was taken , he desired to be put into a room with several men , to see whether the Prosecutrix knew him : and as soon as she came into the room , she said , That is the man that robbed me , though he was in another coat then . I am not going to say , I saw the man rob her . because I did not . Richard Bird . I was asked , whether I knew the Prisoner . I said , very well ; and we took him ( I think it was on the 25th of October ) in his own room . Q to Harvey . Where did you go after the Prisoner robbed you ? Harvey . I went to Kilbourn , to one Mrs . Waters 's , and staid there all night . Q . What did you say to her ? Harvey . When I went in she asked me what made me look so much frightened ; I said , I was robbed , and she went with me the next morning to see if we could get any intelligence of the Prisoner . Q . You say you was down upon the ground , then you think he took the money out of your pocket , when you were upon the ground ? Harvey . He did not take it then , he took it from me after I was up again upon my legs . I beg leave to say two words more , that when I spoke to him for my money , I observed he had a very great impediment in his speech ; and the Prisoner has a very great one . Mary Blaker . I keep the house at Paddington , where the Prosecutrix says the Prisoner was with her . I come here to prove that the Prisoner is not the man that was at my house . Q . Do you know the prosecutrix , Isabella Harvey ? Blaker . She was at my house , and drank a pot of beer , but it was another man that was with her ; I never saw the Prisoner but once before this : she came with a young man in a blue grey suit with white buttons , he was a pale man , as pale as a Sheet . Catherine Gray . I am a servant to Mrs. Blaker . Q . Did Isabella Harvey come to your house at any time ? Gray . Yes , but I ca n't tell when . Q . Is the Prisoner the man that was with her ? Gray . No , he is not . Q . Is he like him ? Gray . No , he is no more like him than I am . Thomas Littlewood . I am sure the Prisoner is the man that followed Harvey into the house ; I am sure he 's the very man , - he was dressed in a blue grey coat , like that he has on . - I ca n't say that is the coat . James Rubineau . I think the Prisoner is a moulder . I happened to be at Mrs. Blaker 's when the Prosecutrix came in the day after the robbery : she called Mrs. Blaker , and said , do you know that man that was with me last night ? Why , said Mrs. Blaker ? Says the Prosecutrix , he has robbed me . Says Mrs. Blaker , I am surprized you should go over the fields with a man you never saw in your life : what did he use you ill ? No , says she , no otherwise than in taking my money from me . Says Mrs. Blaker , you were certainly fuddled , and I would not let you have any more liquor ; the Prosecutrix said then , she was robbed of a cloak , a hat , and a handkerchief ; Mrs. Blaker said , you had no such things with you last night ; I knew Evans very well , and when he was taken up , I went to see him , and somebody said Mrs. Harvey was a litigious woman ; I said she was not litigious , but only wanted her 16 s. again . Peter Blaker . There was a note given between the Prosecutrix and her brother , the constable , about the reward , and Littlewood said he would get the note away , and make away with it , and then they could not prosecute . Littlewood . I never saw any note . Q . Did you ever hear of any ? Littlewood . I never did . Acquitted . 40 , 41 . + William Bailey , and Rebecca Brown , of St. James , Westminster , were indicted for assaulting Alice the wife of George Ellwood , on the King 's highway , putting her in fear , & c. and taking from her a pocket , value 2 d. and eight shillings in money , the property of George Ellwood , November the 9th . Alice Ellwood . I live in Peter's-street , Old Soho ; the two Prisoners came into my shop ; the woman prisoner said the man prisoner was a street robber , and robbed a man in St. James 's ; he wanted a half penny-worth of pease porridge , and that woman called me a great many names , because I would not let him have any ; and they both dragged me out into the street by the hair of my head ; I did not miss my pocket then , though I felt it rent ; I run in my hair to Sir Thomas Deveil 's , and I got eleven pence from one of my acquaintance ( who is hired to swear against me ) to get a warrant ; - I did not know but there had been a shilling , till the Justice 's Clerk told it over . Q . When did you miss your pocket ? Ellwood . I missed it before I went the length of the street . Q . How much money had you in it ? Ellwood . There were eight shillings , and some half-pence . - My husband is a chair-man . Coun . What business are you ? Ellwood . I keep a house of lodgers . Coun . I thought they came to buy something of you ; what do you sell ? Ellwood . I sell pease porridge and sheeps heads . Coun . Had not you quarrelled with the man prisoner before ? Ellwood . I never had , but I was advised not to let him come into my house , for he used to make it his business to fire swan-shot at the neighbours windows , and I have seen him do it . Q . Did you call out ? Ellwood . Yes . Q . Did any body come to your assistance ? Ellwood . No . Coun . Did you know the Prisoners before ? Ellwood . they lived in a place near me , he has come and broke my shop windows open . James Robinson . The Prosecutrix came to my house , with a search warrant , to serve upon the prisoners , and I found them in Peter's-street , next door to where the Prosecutrix lives . George Appleby . This woman [ Ellwood ] came to me , as being Constable last year , to inform her where she might find a Constable : I went with her to the Constable , and we took the prisoners within a door or two or Ellwood 's house . Patrick Henley . I was drinking in a house at the backside of Oxford Row , the Prosecutrix came in there , and said , she had sent two prisoners to goal , for they had knocked her down , and took her pocket off ; and in the said house before witnesses she said , they did not take any thing from her . Q . How long time was it between her saying , they had knocked her down and robbed her , and her saying , that they took nothing from her ? Henley . But a little time - about half an hour . I asked her how she could in conscience swear that , and she said she did it out of vexation for their abusing her . Dorothy Walker . On the 9th of November , in Sir Thomas De Veil 's passage , I asked Ellwood , how she could swear against the Prisoners , to for-swear herself . The answer she made was , she was sorry for what she had done , but it was out of her power to recal it ; but , said she , if I had not sworn a robbery against them , they would have sworn one against me . Acquitted . 42 . + Jane Morgan , of St. Luke 's , was indicted for stealing nine ounces and twelve penny weight of gold thread , value 4 l. sixteen ounces of gold and silver waste , value 4 l. and six ounces of silver thread , value 15 s. the goods of Richard Panton , in his warehouse , Nov. 5 . Richard Panton . I live in Checquer-alley , White-cross-street ; I am a silver spinner : the Prisoner living pretty near us , and being great with my daughters , came into the kitchen on the 5th of November to one of my girls , and asked her to go for a quartern of geneva : I missed these goods out of my warehouse , and enquired of my daughter , who had been there . She told me , the Prisoner had . I went in pursuit of her , and found her at a disorderly house in Beech-lane , on the 7th of Nov. between one and two in the morning . I asked her , what was become of my work ? She said , she knew nothing of it . I said , yes , you do ; you are a thief . At last she owned she took two bobbins weight nine ounces , and twelve penny weight of gold thread , and Stevenson delivered ten ounces of silver waste to me ; but she had burnt a good deal of it - She said at first that she found it ; but she said afterwards she had carried it back again , and hid it under a bench by my shed door . Q . How do you know they were taken out of your warehouse ? Panton . Because when our people had done work , I locked up the warehouse door ; and I am sure these goods were in the warehouse at that time , for I had but just made an end of them . William Stevenson . On the 7th of November , about seven in the morning , I took the Prisoner in Beech-lane ; I had heard that Mr. Panton had been robbed , and I sent for him ; at first she denied it , and before the Alderman she said , she had left some at her lodging in Beech-lane .

Sevill , had and held in her right-hand , and thereby giving to Mary Cartwright , one mortal wound and bruise on the second of Nov. last ; of which she languished from the said second day of Nov. to the 22 day of Nov. and then of the said mortal wound and bruise died . She was a second time charged on the Coroner 's inquisition for manslaughter . Ann Sandford . The Prisoner and Mary Cartwright the deceased were my servant s ; they had been scolding with one another that morning ; I was in the kitchen , when the accident happened , and did not know there was a blow given till the deceased fell down by me , and brushed my cloaths in the fall ; I observed that her face was all bloody . Q . How was this done ? Sandford . The girl-that is dead , said , the prisoner struck her with a smoothing iron , - the wound was given the 2d of November , and she died on the 21st day after she received the wound . Q . Did you see the wound given ? Sandford . I was washing my hands then , I did not see the blow given . - I did not hear the blow . Q . Had they been quarrelling ? Sandford . They had been quarrelling all the morning , but the deceased owned she had struck the Prisoner before . Q . What did she say she struck her with ? Sandford . With her hand . Q . What was the quarrel about ? Sandford . About drying a gown ; the deceased had put a gown to the fire , and the prisoner pushed it away , and that made the deceased angry ? Coun . Did the deceased do your business afterwards ? Sandford . She did the business for ten days after as well as usual . Q . Did she complain of any thing ? Sandford . She complained of a pain in her head , and that she could not stoop very well . Mr. Westbrook ( Surgeon ) About the 2d of November , I was sent for to the deceased ; I found her in the kitchen ; this lady , her mistress , was there , and the person who , as she said , had given her the blow , ( the prisoner was then ironing ) there was a small wound a little above the forehead ( they scolded very heartily at one another , and I thought they were very much to blame . ) The wound being done with an iron , I examined it very carefully , and it appeared to be no more than a common simple wound . Q . Was the skull hurt ? Westbrook . The skull was bare , but it was not at all affected : before I leave the kitchen I would observe , that Mrs. Sandford reprimanded them both for scolding ; and the Prisoner said , Madam , I can not bear such usage from a fellow servant , for she has struck me twenty times , at least , to my striking her once . Q . Did the deceased deny it ? Westbrook . Not at all . My Lord , where these unlucky things happen ( for I should be pretty well acquainted with these things in forty years practice ) it is always my practice to wash very carefully : I attended her twelve days , and had very little complaint , and thought it would end well ; and to save charges she came to my house to be dressed . On the 15th day I saw the deceased with a brush in her hand , scrubbing a very large-room ; I advised her in matter of prudence not to do it , though I did not see any necessity for that direction at that time . The Prisoner quite scolded with the deceased , because she was so work-brittle , as they call it . The day after the 14th or 15th day , the Prisoner lay in bed , and did not rise ( whether it was out of fullenness or not , because the other was not turned away , I ca n't tell ) and would not take her food . Q . Did you search the wound again ? Westbrook . The wound was very near quite whole , and no farther search could be made , but the symptoms increasing , I had a Surgeon joined with me , and we thought proper to make the operation of the Trepan , for I thought possibly I might find something remarkable upon the brain , but there was not the least mark of injury upon the skull ; the symptoms still increased , and about the 21st or 22d day she died ; I opened the head , and found in the middle of the brain , to my great surprize , a very large imposthumation , which I apprehend might be occasioned by the blow . Q . Do you think the imposthumation was occasioned by the blow ? Westbrook . I can not help thinking so , but I can not be positive but that it might be occasioned from an inward cause , for she had frequently very great pains in her head . Mr. Chiselden said , that he was sent for to the deceased ; that about a day or two before her death the symptoms began to be very severe , and he thought there might be a fracture in the skull , and that there might be some blood settled under the wound , and therefore proposed the Trepan : he was not there at the operation , but he could not conceive how a blow that a person could go abroad with for a fortnight , and do their business as usual , and no blood underneath , could be the cause of her death ; and how that could affect the brain , he did not know : but he said , these imposthumations do happen sometimes to those people who are very much troubled with head-aches : and could not comprehend that this blow was the immediate cause of her death .

I compute the number to be about nine or ten , but I ca n't tell the number because it was dark . Q . Can you say there were seven or eight ? Underwood . There were seven or eight at the least , but there were more to be sure , because there were a great many about me . Q . Were there any women among them ? Underwood . I did not see any . Q .

Q . Did they take any money from you ? Underwood . To the best of my knowledge they did not take any ? Q . Look at the Prisoners , and see if you know any of them ? Underwood . I ca n't swear to any of them ; the boy was much about the size of Gadd . - I am cook to the Duke of Montrose . Ann Wells . I was with Mr. Underwood at Bartholomew fair , but I ca n't say on what day of the month , but it was between nine and ten at night ; he was between his sister and I , handing me cross a channel ; there were several fellows came , and parted us , and pushed us into the crowd . - I believe there were seven or eight of them . Q . Was there a boy among them ? Wells . I ca n't say whether there was or not ; when Mr. Underwood came out of the crowd , his head was broke in a terrible manner , - he was in a bloody condition . Q. Mr. Underwood , you did not mention that , were you knocked down ? Underwood . They knocked me down and broke my head . Wells . When they had got Mr. Underwood into the crowd , I squawled out , and one of them gave me a blow across my back , but they did not hurt me ; whether it was done designedly or no I ca n't tell . There were several gentlemen came to our assistance , but none of them would go to Mr. Underwood 's , there were so many of the fellows . Q . Had he any hat on when he came out of the crowd ? Wells . He had none , I think he had his wig in his hand when he came back . Q . What did he say then ? Wells . He said , they had robbed him of his watch and hat - that he mentioned directly , and some time after he mentioned his stick and handkerchief . Q . Had he a watch when he went out ? Wells . Yes , he had ; he looked what it was o'clock , just before he went out - I do n't know any of the Prisoners . William Harper * , the accomplice , sworn . * He went among his companions by the name of Old Daddy , and sometimes Old Man ; on account of his being more grave in company than the others . He is twenty-six years of age . Prisoner Watson . Did not the thieftakers after you were taken up , threaten to hang you if you did not make a discovery of such and such things ; and you said then you did not know any thing of them ? Harper . No ; they never threatened me about any thing : only they brought a man to swear a robbery against me , and I never saw the man before in my life . Watson . Please to turn Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Boddy out of Court . Harper acquainted the Court with the names of all the Prisoners , and distinguished their persons .

Q . Where did you live before ? Harper . I lived in Black-boy-alley , before I went to St. Giles 's . Jack Neaves and Popes had the house , and let it out to us ; Billingsly lived at Pope 's , and Potbury and I lived at Giles 's . Q . Did you lodge with Potbury ? Harper . Yes . Q . How came you to move to St. Giles 's ? Harper . And please you , my Lord ; I went there to live with a young woman , I am almost ashamed to speak , but that was the occasion of my going there . Q . Now give an account what you know of robbing Mr. Underwood ? Harper . It was in Smithfield , the first day of Bartholomew fair . Q . Was there any appointment made among you to meet there ? Harper . No , we met by accident ; when I went there I found Potbury and Billingsly together . Q . What time did you go ? Harper . About four o'clock in the afternoon - I met them about dusk , and then I met Roberts and Page . Q . What time did you meet them ? Harper . About the same time - we met in the street . Q . Who did you meet besides ? Harper . I met Bannister , Morris and Lippy ( who are not taken ) Brister , and Theophilus Watson - and I believe there was Gadd ; there were ten besides myself , and I made the eleventh , that robbed this gentleman . Q . When you were got together , what did you do with yourselves ? Harper . We walked about the fair , hitting people over the head , and picking of pockets , till eight or nine o'clock ; and then a little on this side the George Inn they were coming along , and two or three of them took hold of a gentleman . Q . Did you talk of what you were to do , or of robbing people , before they attacked that gentleman ? Harper . No , not that night . Q . Now give a distinct account what you know of the gentleman . Harper . I think I should not know the gentleman again , because it was in the dark . They all got round him , Billingsly got hold of one arm , and Bannister and Morris took hold of the other arm , and Potbury took his watch out of his pocket . Q . Did they take any thing else from him ? Harper . When Potbury took his watch , the gentleman went to catch hold of the person , who he thought took it ; and they fell a laying him over the head with their sticks : in the skirmish the gentleman 's hat came off , and Roberts took the hat and stick up , and run away with them . Q . What did Gadd do ? Harper . Only laid the man over the head with his stick , as the others did . Q . Where did you go after that ? Harper . Into Smithfield Rounds , stealing of gingerbread , & c. and staid there till I believe eleven o'clock at night ; then Billingsly , Gadd , and I , went to St. Giles 's . Q . What did you do with the watch ? Harper . One William Turbutt , who is in custody , bought it of us for twenty eight Shillings - he lived in Sharp's-Alley by Cow-Cross . Q . What is he ? Harper . He is a pick-pocket , as well as we , he used to buy things of us . Q . Did he buy all the things you got ? Harper . No , there were some Jews used to buy of us sometimes . Q . Who was the disposer of these things ? Harper . Potbury and Billingsly were . Q . Where was the watch sold ? Harper . In Cross Lane towards St. Giles 's . Q . How came you to go there ? Harper . Because we were always complaisant to one another ; sometimes they came to us , and sometimes we went to them . Q . Who had the hat ? Harper . Billingsly had the hat for four shillings . Q . How did you divide the money ? Harper . Ten of us had three shillings a piece , but they would not give the man with the scratched face [ Page ] any thing - the overplus was spent among us . Q . Had the boy Gadd 3 s. ? Harper . Yes . Q . How came it that Page had not any part of the money ? Harper . They made a fool of him , and would not let him have any . Q . What did he say to that ? Harper . He was a little angry at first , but he went away , and did not make much noise about it . Q . Should you know the hat again ? Harper . That is the hat , I really believe , but I ca n't swear to it . Prisoner Billingsly . Had the watch a chain , or a seal ? Harper . I do n't know that , though I saw the watch opened - the outside and inside cases were silver . Prisoner Billingsly . If he knows the man lost a watch , he must know whether it had a chain or a seal . Harper . If we got any watches with chains or seals , Billingsly and Potbury would take them off , and cheat us of them , so I could not swear to chains or seals . Q . Who were the chief managers ? Harper . Billingsly and Morris used to do what they would . I always had my fair Part , but they used to cheat Page . Q . How often was Page with you ? Harper . Never but twice . Q . What business is Billingsly ? Harper . I believe he is a lamp-lighter , but he has not been so these three years ; his father is a shoe-maker . Billingsly . Was there a chain or a string to the watch ? Harper . I ca n't say which . Billingsly . What time o'night was this ? Harper . About nine o'clock , as near as I can guess . Billingsly . I ask you , whether you did not say in the Compter , that Mr. Broomer and others would put you into the cells , and would not give you either victuals or drink , if you would not turn Evidence ? Harper . I never said such a word . Billingsly . Did not you say that Mr. Boddy , & c. made you swear what you knew nothing of ? Harper . No . I did say that Mr. Boddy and the thief-takers , brought a Man to swear a robbery against me , that I knew nothing of . Q . What robbery was that ? Harper . A man came to swear that I robbed him of a silver mounted pistol . Q . What is the man 's name ? Harper . I ca n't tell , 't is a tall man * who came to take the boys out of Black-Boy alley , and they cut him terribly . * Alexander Forfar a headborough , who last sessions indicted Thomas Wells , Theophilus Watson , Joshua Barnes , Thomas Kirby and Ann Duck , for robbing him of a pistol & c. on the highway , and has this sessions indicted Ann Collier for the same robbery . See trial 431. to 435. p. 229 . Prisoner Watson . You say the outside and inside cases of the watch were silver , what was the number of it ? Harper . I should not have known the number if I had seen it , for I can neither write nor read . Watson . Ca n't you tell whether it had a string or a seal ? Harper . I ca n't tell , and I am sure I would not say a false thing . Watson . Was I ever in your company , or in any of their companies ? Harper . You never was much , unless it was now and then : for the others thought themselves above you , and would not admit you into their company . Watson . I never was in his company at all . Q . How came he to be in Company this night ? Harper . Because he was picking pockets with the rest in Bartholomew fair . Q . Did he use to drink with you now and then ? Harper . Yes , we drank together now and then . Q . When were you taken up ? Harper . I was taken up on Lord Mayor 's day , at the end of Queen-street in Cheapside , in the crowd . Q . Who was taken up first ? Harper . The little boy [ Gadd ] was ; and James Roberts was in Bridewell when I was taken up . Billingsly , Morris , and I , hearing that Gadd and Roberts were in custody , went on board a ship at Shadwell Dock , which I believe is a privaseer . I came from on board the ship , and left those two there . I staid there about two days , and there was a man coming on shore , and he said , I might come on shore with him : I thought they wanted to get rid of my company , so I came on shore on Lord Mayor 's day , the very day that I was taken . Q . Who took you ? Harper . Long Charles and Bob Maycraft , and those that get their bread that way . Q . How long after you were taken up , did you give this information ? Harper . Lord Mayor 's day was on the Monday . and I gave my information on the Tuesday night - of this , and several other robberies . Billingsly . Ask the gentleman whether it was the first or second day of the fair , that he lost his watch . Harper . You know it was the first day , for you was afraid of going to the fair the second day , and we went to the other end of the town , and robbed a gentleman of a gold watch . Watson . Was not you put into the cells the first day , and confined in order to make you give evidence ? Harper . I was put into the cells to be sure , but I do n't know that it was to make me give evidence ; I was not above two or three hours in the cells , and then , I was carried before two magistrates in Newgate , and gave this information before them . Watson . Why did you not give your information the first day , after you were taken up ? Harper . Because I was charged with a thing I knew nothing of , and therefore I hoped to get off - I was carried to the Counter on Monday night , and the next day before the Alderman at Guild-hall , who committed me to Newgate . Richard Huntley . I am sure this is a hat I sold , for I put the lining in my self , I believe this is the hat that Mr. Underwood the father bought of me . - He bespoke it of me , and I took measure of his son 's head . Underwood Senior . I bespoke the hat of Mr. Huntley . Underwood Junior . I had the hat of Mr. Huntley , by my father 's order . William Broomer . I am a constable , I had the hat of Billingsly at Guild-Hall , before the sitting Alderman : Billingsley had the hat in his hand . Billingsly . I borrowed the hat of my brother . Prisoner Roberts . Ask him why he did not put me in his first information ? Harper . My lord , I did . The examination of William Harper taken the 30th of Oct. 1744. by Sir Robert Ladbroke and Sir William Calvert Knights , was produced : wherein Harper says , that himself , Brister , Page , Bannister , Potbary , Roberts , Gadd and Theophilus Watson went to Bartholomew fair , and husled a gentleman up , and took his watch from him , and in the fray the gentleman lost his hat . Q. to Underwood . When did you hear of these people being taken up ? Joseph Underwood . I think it was last friday , I saw it in the news papers , I did not know any thing of it before ; I went the next morning to Mr. Jones , and enquired about it . William Brister . I never saw the evidence before in my life . Harper . He was with me in another robbery besides this . Q. to Underwood . Did you strike any of them ? Underwood . I collared one of them , and called people to my assistance . Q. to Gadd . What age are you ? Prisoner Gadd . * I am between ten and eleven . * The evidence Harper says , he is fourteen years of age . Gadd . What he says of me , is all said wrong , for I never saw him , before I saw him before the Alderman . Q . What did you use to do before ? Gadd . I used to sell rabbits about streets . Q . What , for yourself ? Gadd . Yes , I used to buy them in Clare market - I lived in Hedge lane with Mr. Wright - he is dead - he has been dead about a year and an half . I lived afterwards with a woman by the New market , she sells fowls and ducks about streets - I do n't know where she is . Q . Why does not she come ? Gadd . She wo n't come . William Cromarty .

I have known Billingsly from a child , and never knew any harm of him - he used to light lamps , I ca n't say how long he has left it off , I have often seen him in the neighbourhood - I ca n't say that he has been in a settled way of life lately - I can not pretend to say much to his character .

I took one of the things to be a child 's boat at first . The plate , linen , and cloaths were sold all together for four pounds , sixteen shillings . Q . What has been your business for some time past ? Harper . I am a shoemaker , but I have followed this wicked way , as well as they , these four years . - I have known Graves about half a year , I never was concerned with him in any other robbery , for he used to work very hard when I knew him first ; I believe he was drawn in by Jack Potbury . Coun . to Gorman . I ask you whether you did not tell Graves 's mother , that you would take twenty pounds , though the goods were worth thirty five pounds , and would go into the country , and would not prosecute him ?

William Harper . William Billingsly , Henry Gadd , and John Graves , were concerned with me in stealing the aforementioned goods , from a man who lives in a street behind Red-Lion square , and Richard Morris was concerned in it . Q . When were they stolen ? Harper . About a week before Lord Mayor 's day , Jack Graves got upon the rails , in order to get into the house , but jumped down again , upon some people 's coming along ; when the street was silent , he got up again , went into the house , and handed out one bundle of linen to Henry Gadd , then he handed out another bundle of linen , and gave it to Billingsly : I took the two bundles of linen from those two , and then he handed out a coat and waistcoat to Morris . Q . What did you do with them ? Harper . We took coach in Holbourn , and went to Duke's-place , but Morris walked there ? Q . Where does the Prisoner live ? Harper . I do n't know , but I have heard them say he lives in Houndsditch , for only Morris went in with the things , and he met us afterwards at the Plaisterer's-arms in Duke's-place - this was about nine o'clock at night , there were three other Jews looked over them before the Prisoner , but did not bid so much for them by a guinea . I saw Samuel Levi pay four pounds sixteen shillings for those goods , and the money was equally divided between us . Q . Was it in the Prisoner 's presence ? Harper . I ca n't say that , but he sat and drank three or four pots of beer with us afterwards . Q . Did the Prisoner discourse with Morris before you about buying of them ? Harper . No otherwise than between themselves ; I saw Morris and him go out of the house together , Morris had the plate in his pocket , and the rest of the things in a handkerchief when they went out ; Morris said he had got nine-pence a yard for the cloth , four shillings and six-pence an ounce for the silver , and twenty six shillings for the cloaths . Q . What did the Prisoner give the money for ? Harper . I ca n't tell , only as Morris informed me , to be sure he would not give us the money for nothing ; Morris said he wished he had money enough , and he would have bought them himself , for he thought them worth more money . James Gorman . When Harper turned the king 's evidence , he sent to me to let me know that one Samuel Levi had bought my goods . I got a warrant , and took two women with me , in order to decoy him out of Duke's-place , under a pretence that they had three or four watches to sell ; Graves 's mother endeavoured to assist us in taking Levi , that in case I had got my goods again , I might be the more easy with her son ; we found Levi in Duke's-place , and he desired I would bring the goods , and he would look at them ; said I , Bring your weights and scales to the Plaisterer's-arms , but he would not come ; he said he did not care to go any farther , for he was a little in debt ; he came a little way , and then he said his mind misgave him ; said I , there 's the woman above who has the goods . I found he was for turning back , and I took fast hold of him , and took hold of his breeches , and said , Lawrence , cock your pistol : Lawrence said , I design to do it ; Levi took hold of me , and tore my waistcoat and shirt almost to pieces ; then one of the women took hold of him , and we secured him .

James Hind . On the 20th of August , about nine in the evening , I was coming down Cheapside with some gentlemen 's servants ; several people hussled them , and presently after they hussled my fellow servant and me , ( his name is Thomas Read ) and robbed me of a silver watch , a steel seal , and a padlock key . They all surrounded me ; one of them clapped his hand upon my breast , and the little one in the black wig [ Potbury ] I think 't is him , robbed me . Q . Was there any boy among them ? Hind . I do n't know that there was ; I ca n't say any thing to that ; they put me in a great fright . Q . Do you know Page ? Hind . I ca n't say that I do ; I do n't know any body but him in the black wig . I heard of some people being taken up , by an advertisement that was published . I went one day last week to enquire about it , and was in hopes of hearing of my watch again , but I never did . William Harper . On the 20th of August , it was a particular day , for I , Morris , and Billingsly had heard that one Edward Young * was taken up for a robbery , and we were sent for to endeavour to get him away . * He was indicted last October Sessions for breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Thomas Burn in the day time , no person being therein , and received sentence of Transportion . Page 228 . Trial 429 . Q . Did they always send for you upon these occasions ? Harper . They always helped one another , if they knew them . Q . Suppose you did not know them , would you do it then ? Harper . If we met a man with a Constable in the Street , though we did not know him , we went to rescue him . The same night Billingsly went to the Horns in Gutter Lane , and called for a glass of brandy , and seeing a silver spoon he broke it in two , and that he kept to himself ; we went to Holbourn Bridge , and there we met Page , Brister and Lippy ; then we saw Joseph Field and two or three more , we told them about rescuing Young , and they said they would not get themselves into a broil for any body : when we got to the end of Woodstreet we met Henry Gadd , and Jack the Sailor - some of them had hangers . Q . What could Gadd do to rescue any body ? Harper . He could do as much mischief as anybody . Q . How did they carry their hangers ? Harper . At their belts under their coats , they did not mind who saw them . Q . Did Gadd carry a hanger ? Harper . Yes . Q . Did he carry his under his coat ? Harper . His was one that was broke and ground down , and as it was shorter than the others , it would be hid pretty well under his coat . Jack Potbury and Gadd had got a watch in Wood-street , and they wanted to keep it : then we went up Wood-street , and in Cheapside we met two men , and Jack the Sailor took a watch from one of them . Q . What time of night was it ? Harper . It was about eight o'clock . Q . Was it not dark then ? Harper . It was just dusk . Hind . I was robbed between Wood-street and Gutter-lane . Harper . It was about thirty yards on this side Wood-street ; after that we went all in a body down Newgate-street , and then they were wrangling and quarrelling as they went along the street , who had a right to what they had got that day ; and Billingsly said to Watson , that he should have nothing , and that Page should have nothing , and that Roberts should have nothing ; but Tho . Watson stuck to it , and went to the Brown Bear in Seacole Lane . Q . Was Page with you at this robbery ? Harper . Yes . Q . What did he do ? Harper . We all assisted alike - Page had no part of the money , nor Roberts neither ; and The . had no other part but what Brister gave him , for they went out picking of pockets together , and Brister said , he should have part of it . Brister . Mr. Broomer impressed me , and I was sent down to Tilbury Fort . He was impressed upon Ludgate-hill , and sent away the impress before last . James Page , acquitted ; Brister , Roberts , Watson , Potbury , Gadd and Billingsly , guilty Death . 66.

Robert Clinton . I live in Richmond-street by St. Ann 's in St. James 's parish . On the 23d of November last , about seven o'clock at night , I was passing out of Duke-street , that leads to the Romish chapel , going into Lincoln's-inn-fields , and just as I got under the archway , the Prisoner says to me , D - n you , give me your money , not a word : I started back and he whipped a knife or a hanger from under his coat , and struck at me . I have the bag here , which was cut at the time he cut at me . [ the bag was produced with two cuts in it ] I said to him , do n't murder me , take what I have ; there came another person who took me by the arms behind , while the Prisoner unbuttoned my breeches , and took out my money ; there were seven shillings in silver , and some half pence ; there was a third person , who I suppose was concealed , and they all went off together : I went from thence to a friend 's of mine in Cow Cross - Mr. George Pewterer , a Brazier . Q . Where was you going when he assaulted you ? Clinton . I designed to go to Fleet-street . When I went into Mr. Pewterer 's house , I could hardly speak ; he said , what is the matter with you ? he said so several times : ( I was out of a hot sweat into a cold one , and out of a cold one into a hot one , ) I told him what had happened to me , and related the story to him , as I have related it now ; he asked me if I had any acquaintance with Constantine Macguire ; I said I had seen him frequently some years ago , at a house that I frequented , and I remembered him very well . Q . How do you know he is the man ? Clinton . By virtue of my oath he is the man , he was in a brown coat with white metal buttons : I have seen him at James Keynon 's who kept a publick house in new Bond street - he has been dead about five years ; I knew him about seven years ago , by being there , and as I am a Shoemaker I went there pretty often ; because , as several gentlemen 's servants used the house , I did it in order to gain custom - 't is about seven years since I saw him there . Q . How came you to remember him so well ? Clinton . The man of the house told me he had played some sharping tricks with him , and pointed the Prisoner out to me , and told me his name , and whenever I saw him since , I always knew him - I never had any conversation with him . Q . When did you take him up ? Clinton . He robbed me the 23d , and he was taken the 26th at night , in Parker 's lane by Drury lane . Prisoner . I went to drink with him , and he got a Constable , and took me . Q. to Clinton . How is that ? Clinton . I enquired after him , and got scent of him ; I was directed to go to one Macguire 's at the Golden hart in Parker 's lane . I went into Parker 's lane , but it was not my business to tell them what I wanted with him ; so I enquired after one John Macguire , and a woman told me , there was one Constant . Macguire , who could inform me where to find him . I said , if I found him , I could inform him of something to his advantage ; the woman said there were three Constantine Macguires ; I said Constantine Macguire was a tall man , and he could inform me ; she said , I must go to Mrs. Macguire 's , who was a relation of the Prisoner 's , and she could tell me where to find him . I went there , and told her I wanted one John Macguire , and was directed to Constantine Macguire to know where to find him - this was on the Saturday , and I was robbed on the Friday night ; she asked me my name , I told her my name was Robert , and she called me afterwards by the name of Roberts , and I did not contradict her ; I wanted to know when he would be there , she said , he came there every night ; and I went again to her on Monday morning , and she said , she had told the Prisoner , but he did not know me by my name . I went to Mrs. Macguire 's again on Monday night , and told her I had met with John Macguire who was going on board a man of war , and I came to tell Constantine Macguire that he was a proper man to assist me : so I asked him to go and drink a pot of ale with me , and got him out of Parker 's lane ; I had another along with me , so we went all together into Drury lane ; I got him up into the club room and secured him ; when I got up stairs , I said , Do you know me ? he said , he did not : said I , You robbed me last Friday night , and you had this coat on with the yellow lining ; and he said , Da - n this yellow lining : I am a dead man . Q . What was the reason you could not apprehend him in Parker 's lane ? Clinton . I would not pretend to do it there , I should have been afraid of my life , there are such a pack of villains there ; and at the Golden Hart in Parker 's lane , there was such a crew singing and making a noise , that I was afraid to stay there . Q . How long ago is it since you saw the Prisoner last ? Clinton . I believe , to the best of my knowledge , about 8 or 9 months . Q . What has been his way of life ? Clinton . I ca n't tell his way of life , he has a very bad character - that he has no visible way of living . Q . Did you ever hear that he followed any business ? Prisoner . I am a gentleman 's servant . Clinton . The Constable said , he had not been in any service these seven years . Prisoner . If I knew there could have been any thing against me , I would not have gone with them to drink . Coun . I think you said you had known the Prisoner for a considerable time ? Clinton . Yes . Q. Pray had you ever been in his company before ? Clinton . No , I do n't know that ever I have been in his company , only in a public house . Q . Did you frequent the same public house amiss did ? Clinton . No . Q . Have you been in the same public house that he was ? Clinton . Yes - not often , but I have been with him so often as to know him . Q . Do n't you think then , that he would have known you ? Clinton . No , I do n't believe he did know me . Q . You said at first that the public house that he frequented , was a house that you used to go to , which gentlemens servants frequented . Clinton . I did say so ; but I found that he had quarrelled with the man of the house , and he would not let him have any liquor , so he did not come there . Q . Where was it that the Prisoner first attacked you ? Clinton . Just by the wall by the Sardinian ambassador 's chapel . Q . How could you see so as to distinguish his face ? Clinton . There was a lamp against the wall ; and when he stood before me , and unbuttoned my breeches , I saw him very perfectly ; I know him perfectly well ; and I took notice of the colour of the lining of his coat , and the cape was lined with the same . I swore to the colour of his coat , and the lining before , that it was either yellow , or of a yellowish hue . Q . Can you by such a light as that , swear to a yellow from a white ? Clinton . No , I will not , but I took it to be a yellow . George Pewterer . On Friday the 23d of November , the Prosecutor came into my house between seven and eight at night ; when he came up stairs , he seemed to be very much surprized , and could not speak for a minute or two . I sent for a dram , and asked him what was the matter . He said , Master enough ; that he had like to have lost his life within this half hour ; and told me he had been robbed , and was very much frightened , but he said he had a mind to put it up , though he knew the man very well : for the charge of prosecuting such a villain , and losing his time , would be more than the loss he had sustained . I said , If you do n't prosecute him , you ought to be served so the next night you go out ; for that is the way to have men cut to pieces . He went home , and advised with some of his friends ; and they advised him to prosecute : he desired me to go with him to Sir Thomas De Veil 's ; he got a warrant , and had information that he might be found at the Golden Hart in Parker's-lane . We went to Parker's-lane , and as the Prosecutor has said , pretended he wanted a person who he did not want ; and he went to the woman of the house again on Monday night , but we had no weapon neither he nor I . While he was talking , in comes the Prisoner - I was not there when the Prisoner came in ; I waited just by , and the Prisoner and the Prosecutor came together to me without any body with them . When we came out of Parker's-lane ( by the Prisoner 's talk I thought it must be him ) I took hold of his coat , and we all went to a public house . Q . What did he say when you took hold of his coat ? Pewterer . I told him I had a warrant against him for an assault , and he said , at whose suit ? for he did not know that he had struck any body . Q . Did he make any resistance ? Pewterer . He made no opposition , and I told him , I would treat him with all the civility he could desire . Q . What house did you go to ? Pewterer . We went to the Duke 's head in Drury-lane ; I told him I would treat him with a tankard of beer , and asked him what he would have for supper ; I sat down on one side of him , and the Prosecutor on the other , and when the Constable came in , I gave him the warrant , and the Constable said he knew him , ( but that is not material ) the Prosecutor said to the Prisoner , do you know me now ; the Prisoner said , I never knew you before ; the Prosecutor said , I wish I had never known you , for you robbed me last Friday night , and this is the coat you had on then . Prisoner . How should he know the lining of my cape , when my coat was buttoned up to my chin ? Pewterer . Then the Prisoner said , D - n my yellow lining , I am a dead man . The Prosecutor said , Why should you think you are a dead man if you are not guilty . The Prisoner said , If you swear it , to be sure I am ; and he was for knocking every body down as he went along , but there 's nothing in that . Prisoner . I never saw the Prosecutor nor that Gentleman before . Q . Where did the Prosecutor say he was going that night ? Pewterer . He said he was going to Capt . Hayes at the Rainbow coffee-house in Fleetstreet . Q . What did you do with your bag and stretchers ? Clinton . I had been that day at Bloomsbury market , to a Gentleman in order to try his pumps on , but I did not meet with him , and I was to call again in the evening . Q . Did you go there that evening ? Clinton . Yes . Q . What ! after you had been at Cow-cross ? Clinton . No , before that , and from thence I designed to go into Fleet-street . Q . How came you to go by the way of the Sardinian ambassador 's chapel ? Clinton . I thought that was as ready a way as any . Q . How came you to go as far as Cow-cross ? Clinton . Because Mr. Pewterer was a particular friend of mine , and I had a mind to tell him my misfortune . - I live in Richmond-street by St. James 's park , joining to the great blanket warehouse , the back side of St. Ann 's . Q . How came you , when you were very bad with your fright , and ready to die , to go there when it was a dirty way , and as far as if you had gone home ? Clinton . I was as near there as I was to my own house . Q . But was it not as far again back ? Clinton . Yes , but I was afraid I should frighten my wife more , than the value of all I lost . Mr. Dunn . This Mr. Pewterer came to me about six o'clock in the evening , and asked me if my name was Dunn , I said , yes ; he asked if I was a constable , I said , yes . I asked his business , but whether he said it was about a thief , or a street-robber , I ca n't say ; he had no warrant , so I told him I should much rather have a warrant , and go according to law , than to have to do with a man who may prove himself to be an honest man ; he said he believed he was in the custody of the prosecutor at such a place ; I told him I would be with him in a few minutes , and desired the prosecutor to have a warrant ready at the street-door , that I might have that to shew if I took the man ; when I went there I asked the landlord if he had any body there that had any occasion for me , he told me he had ; the Prosecutor gave me the warrant , and when I went up , to my great surprize , I saw that unfortunate fellow there , but I did not know then that I had received any warrant concerning him . Hey , hey , said I , here 's a street robbery sworn against you , what is this the case after all this course of life ? he clapped his hands , and said he knew nothing at all of it . Q . Whose custody was he in then ? Dunn . He sat between the Prosecutor and Mr. Pewterer . Coun . Did you hear the Prosecutor say any thing about the colour of the cloaths ? Dunn . I believe the words did pass , - he insisted upon his innocency to the last ; for he was pressed to make a discovery of his accomplices , but he said he had none , and insisted on his innocency . Q . Did you tell him he was entitled to his pardon , if he discovered his accomplices ? Dunn . Yes , and I believe every body told him so . I have known him between ten and eleven years , and I was a little startled , that a street robbery was sworn against him , because I always took him to be a pusillanimous man , and a man accustomed to drinking , which used to unfit him for Gentlemens business . Q . The Prosecutor said you told him that you had not known him in a place these seven years ? Dunn . That I take to be quite owing to his being given to drinking . Cha . Regan . I am servant to Alderman Gibbon . Q . Are you so now ? Regan . I have not been these twelve months ; I am ill now , and have been so some time : I lived last with the Alderman ; I have known the prisoner between eight and nine years , he was a servant all the time I knew him , till within these few years . Q . When did you see him last before he was taken up ? Regan . I lodge at the Red horse in Bond-street . On the 23d of last month , I came into the taproom , which I very seldom do , and there were two person talking of one of Commodore Anson 's men being arrested ; I went into the room between five and six , and staid with these people till seven o'clock . - There were , besides those two , the Prisoner , one Carrol , and another , who I do n't know . Q . How do you know the time ? Regan . Because I generally go to bed between eight and nine , since I have had this illness . I went to bed immediately . Q . Was the Prisoner in company with the other two who were talking of the arrest of Commodore Anson 's man ? Regan . Yes . Q . When you went to bed , who did you leave in that company ? Regan . The two men I found there . Q . Did you leave the Prisoner there ? Regan . Yes , I left the Prisoner , and the other two . Q . You are sure the clock had then struck seven ? Regan . Yes , I am sure of it - the clock of the house had . Q . How came the Prisoner to be so long out of place ? Regan . I ca n't tell . Q . How came you to be so long out of place as a year ? Regan . Because I have been ill almost over since , and I do n't drink any strong liquors now . Coun . How have you supported yourself all this time ? Regan . By my own industry before . Q . Was Commodore Anson 's man arrested that day ? Regan . That very day . Lyn Mc Cray . I was tapster in the house ; the Prisoner came this day fortnight ; I had been out , I went at three , and came in again at five ; and staying longer than I should , I had not done my business , and my master was angry . I gave him some saucy answers , and he spoke to the Prisoner , and I thought he was going to send him for a Constable . The Prisoner came with his beer into the tap-room at five o'clock - there was one John Duncomb , and two other gentlemen , one 's name is John ; and there was one Carrol , who is clerk to some Attorney . Q . Was the Prisoner in the house after Regan went up stairs ? Mc Cray . Yes , he staid long after that - he went away about nine . Q . What is the name of the person who was arrested ? Mc Cray . His name is Bryan . John Fagan . I am a gentleman 's servant ; I was in the tap-room between two and three o'clock , and saw the Prisoner come in ; I went out , and came back at six o'clock , and the Prisoner was there : I was in his company till almost nine . Mr. Regan was there at the same time . Coun . How often had you seen the Prisoner before ? Fagan . Not often . Q . Did Mr. Regan sit in company ? Fagan . He sat by himself at the fire . Q . What is the man 's Christian name that was arrested ? Fagan . I ca n't tell ; I think his name is Obryan . Edward Highland . I am the hostler ; I was in the tap-room from five o'clock till almost ten . Q . How long was the Prisoner there ? Highland . He could not be ten minutes out of the tap room all the time till almost ten o'clock - I have been there these six years . Jury . This is a house of good repute . [ The stretchers and bag were produced , and the Jury observed that there were two cuts in the bag , and two in the stretchers ; and that the cuts in the stretchers were of the same bigness as those in the bag ] Ann Davy . I am a servant in the house ; I have known the Prisoner between eight and nine years ; I saw him in the kitchen at five o'clock , and gave him a knife and fork - I did not see him after five . Q. to Clinton . Is this the house you knew the Prisoner at first ? Clinton . Yes ; but that man is dead , and his wife too : the present landlord of the house swore that he would not swear , the Prisoner was in the house that night for never so much . Mrs. Macguire . I should know Mr. Clinton 's face if I was to see him , for I had the honour of seeing him twice at my house : he said that Constantine Macguire had a brother come out of the North of Ireland , and that he came about his will and powers . I said Constantine Macguire knew nothing of it . [ Here Mr. Clinton interrupted her . ] I hope the gentleman will not confound me , for I will tell nothing but the truth . Mr. Clinton came to me a Saturday night , and asked what sort of a man Constantine Macguire was . I said he is a good looking man enough . Said he , how does he live ? Said I , some people will give a gentleman 's servant something sometimes to go on an errand , and he does any little thing he can . On Monday night he came again , I asked him his name . He said his name was Robert . I thought his name was Roberts . When the Prisoner came in , I said , Constantine Macguire , do you know one Roberts ? He said , he did not . When Constantine Macguire came in , I said to Mr. Clinton , there 's the man , by virtue of my oath , I said , that is the man ; I said , there 's Constantine Macguire , if you have any thing to say to him . Q . Did the Prosecutor know him , or did he not know him , when he came into the house ? Macguire . By virtue of my oath he did not know him ; and I said to Constantine Macguire , I am answerable for this , because I said , you are the man . Q . Did he ever ask you any questions about the Prisoner 's clothes ? Macguire . He asked me what clothes he wore , what coloured coat , and whether he had a red waist-coat ; I said , Sir , do n't you know him ; he is not so well in clothes as he used to be : and I said , he wore a brown coat turned up with yellow . Q . Are you related to the Prisoner ? Macguire . If I am I will speak nothing but the truth . - Yes I am , but 't is a great way off , his great grand mother , and my great grandmother were brothers and sisters children . Rose Arnott . I was at Mrs. Macguire 's on Monday night , when the Prisoner came in . Q . Did Clinton the Prosecutor speak to him first , or did he not ? Arnott . I do n't know whether I should know the Prisoner . I heard the gentleman ask how Constantine looked , or how he was ; and when Constantine came in , Mrs. Macguire said , there 's the man . Clinton . Indeed , my Lord , I said when he came in , that is the man that robbed me .

Mary Footman . On the 10th of April , I was at Drury lane play-house , and when I came into Bridges street , the Prisoner , and I believe five more laid hold on me ; the others held me , while the Prisoner cut off my pocket , and I was glad to get away with my life - I remember the Prisoner perfectly well , and looked at him thoroughly while he was robbing me , and remember him , I saw him by the light of a lamp . Coun . When was the Prisoner taken up ? Footman . Upon the 10th of Nov. Q . Did you ever see him before that time ? Footman . I believe not . Coun . Have you seen him since ? Footman . Yes , a great many times . Coun . Why did you not take him up ? Footman . He had such a crew about him that every one I spoke to of it , were afraid of him . Coun . Did you see him in the day time ? Footman . Yes , but what could I do when there were twenty people about him ? Coun . Where have you seen him in the day time , and never took him up ? Footman . In Lincoln's-inn-fields - about six o ' clock in the afternoon ( he had somebody with him ) and he asked me how I did ; I said I would do my self and him justice , and would let him know how I did . Coun . Had he the impudence to speak to you , when he had robbed you ? Footman . If he had the Impudence to rob me , he would have the impudence to speak to me - I had my child with me , a little boy about nine years of age . Coun . Was it broad day light ? Footman . Yes , 't is broad day light in summer time about six o'clock . Coun . When did you see him again ? Footman . A great many times . Coun . And you had not courage to take him up ? Footman . I question if he had robbed you , whether you would have had courage to have spoke to him or no . I saw him one night where he cut three ladies pockets off . Coun . Why did you not discover him ? Footman . I had a greater regard for my life . Coun . When did you see him besides ? Footman . At other times , with twenty people round him with cutlasses - twenty together - may be it might be about four o'clock , when I saw him with twenty . Coun . I desire you would answer my questions .

And could you remember his face from that time to this , at that time of night ? Footman . Yes , and so I could your 's , if I should see you seven years hence . Coun . This man 's life lays at stake , you ought to be very careful what you say . Footman , 'T is himself is the occasion of it , 't is not me , if he would let me alone , I would not meddle with him . Coun . When did you take out a warrant ? Footman . As soon as I heard he was to be taken with ease . Coun . 'T is for the sake of the great reward , I suppose that you do this ? Footman . No , Sir , you are mistaken ; this thing was done before the time of the reward being promised , if you please to look back . Coun . So you say you have seen him frequently , and yet would not take him ? Footman . Yes , so I have ; but I have so great a regard to my own life , and the life of my friend , that I would not venture to take him ; for no body would run into the mouth of a lion , with twenty thieves round him . Alexander Langdell . I came down to Mrs. Footman 's house on the fast day , the 11th of April last : and she said , she was robbed by such a man , and knocked down ; she said , she was sure to the man , and that she should know him again if she saw him . I said , I knew them all , and I would go and see ; and he was one of them that were there , when the pressed men were rescued . Prisoner . I am a Cooper at a brew house . Did not you see me in the street , about three weeks before I was taken up ? Langdell . Yes - he was taken up Wednesday was fortnight . Q . Why did you not take him up sooner ? Langdell . I went to Mrs. Footman and told her , I knew where he was , and I said come and see him being it 's a dangerous case for the man 's life is at stake , and she was positive to his person . Q . You said you knew him , and saw him three weeks before , why did you not take him up ? Langdell . I did not know I could take him up without a warrant , and I thought it was the safest way to take him with a Constable . Prisoner . He has seen me twenty times since . Langdell . Yes , so I have , with a great many gamblers and thieves ; he was there when the man was shot . Q . Do you know Mrs. Footman ? Langdell . Her husband keeps a publick house at the black boy in Milford lane . Coun . What sort of a house is it ? Langdell . I think 't is a very good house . Coun . Is it not a night-house ? Langdell . I never heard that it was , and I have drove about five years into the next yard - I am a hackney coachman . Thomas Footman to the Prisoner 's Council . Mr. T - knows me very well . I was not with my wife when she was robbed , but I am certain she lost the goods : she shewed the Prisoner to me a little afterwards . Coun . How came you not to take him then ? Footman . It was on a Sunday night , there was a great disturbance in the Strand ; there was a gentleman had lost his watch ; there were several robberies committed in half an hour , and the Prisoner was among the rest : there was a boy about ten years of age , who was very Cute in that . Coun . When was the Prisoner taken ? Footman . I think it was the 21st of November , at Mr. Smith 's brewhouse ; he thought it had been an arred : he had an adze in his hand : and when they told him it was not an arrest , it was for a street robbery , for robbing Mrs. Footman ; then he swore he was a dead man : and going along he desired not to be carried before such a Justice , because if he went before him , he said he should soon be committed . So when we went in , the Justice said to him , Oh my old Friend , where have you been all this while ; what a n't you hanged yet ? Coun . Did not you know of the reward which is promised for taking of street robbers ? Footman . I did not take him for the sake of the reward , but to justify my wife and my country . I shall call at your chambers one day or other , and let you know whether I keep a night-house or no : you have done business for me , and I have paid you very honourably . William Wootton . I served this warrant upon the Prisoner the 21st of November , at Mr. Smith 's brewhouse by Hide-park-corner : I took one Gardner to assist me . When I took him , he said he had no friends to help him , but he would pray for the woman . Coun . Do you know this Footman , who is so well acquainted with every body ? Wootton . I never saw him before he brought the warrant , to my knowledge - I never heard any thing for or against him - I never saw the Prisoner before I took him . Jury . Did you hear him say , when he was taken , that he was a dead man ? Wootton . I did not hear him say that . Jury . Did you hear the Justice say , his old friend was come ? Wootton . Yes , I heard him say that . William Carter . I was at the taking of the prisoner . Q . Did you hear him say he was a dead man ? Carter . I did not hear him say that ; he said he would pray for the woman . Coun . My Lord , I think 't is a very stale demand , from the 10th of April till November , and never to prosecute till now . John Goodman . I am a Cooper , the Prisoner is my own brother ; he came with Admiral Cavendish from the West-Indies about two years ago , and has worked with me , on and off , ever since ; I recommended him to the Brew-house , and he had worked there three weeks when he was taken . Guilty . Death . 70 . + Sulpice Duclot , of St. James , Westminster , was indicted for stealing a silver buckle set with diamonds , value 10 l. a silk coat with a gold lace , value 40 s. two brocaded waistcoats , value 40 s. one silk waistcoat embroidered with silver , value 40 s. six holland shirts , value 3l . a tortoise-shell snuff-box with a gold hinge , value 10 s. a coat trimmed with gold , value 20 s. a velvet coat , value 40 s. and two pair of sheets , value 20 s. the goods of the honourable Samuel Masham , Esq ; in his dwelling-house , Nov. the 12th . Samuel Masham , Esq ; The Prisoner was servant with me as a valet about four years ; he is a French-man . I charge him with a diamond buckle , which I took from him when he was taken , which was kept in a box in Mrs. Masham 's room . I heard it by the information of Cornelia Augier , who came and told me she believed the Prisoner had got a diamond buckle of mine ; and that he was at her house : I went there with two constables , and he was gone from thence ; I went immediately to my own house , and there I found him ; I sent for him down stairs , and stood in the hall with two servants and two constables ; when he came down I asked him if he had robbed me ; he said , no : I told him , I had been informed , that he had robbed me of Mrs. Masham 's diamond girdle buckle ; at first he said he had not , and desired to speak with me in private , which I refused , and I said , nothing should pass but what was before the people who were there , and I would hear nothing from him in private : I asked him again , whether he had the buckle ; he said , yes , and gave it me out of his pocket ; he said he broke open the box in Mrs. Masham 's dressing room , and took it out . I asked him at that time , what else he had robbed me of ; and as fast as he told me , I wrote them down - the buckle is worth ten pounds at least . He said he had robbed me of a fifty pound bank note . Then he told me of the clothes which he had taken and pawned : he said he did not know the peoples names , but he would go with any body , and shew them where they lived . The clothes have been found , and I have received every thing again that I know of , except the fifty pound bank note . Cornelia Augier . I lodge at a perriwig-makers in Saville-street - my husband washes white silk stockings : the prisoner used to come twice or thrice a day to our house ; he came that week he was taken up , very dull , I asked him what was the matter with him , he said , whatever things were in pledge were his master 's , and he was afraid of his lady 's coming to town , and he must be obliged to make off . When my husband came home I told him this , and I was advised to go to a Counsellor in the Temple , and I went on step by step by his direction , and he advised me to go to his master . Q . Why did you go to a Counsellor ? Augier . Because my husband had pawned some things , and the prisoner 's saying he was obliged to make off , I was afraid we should come into trouble : I met Mr. Masham at White 's Chocolate-house , and I said there were several things in pawn which were his Honour 's , according to the Prisoner 's declaration to me ; on Saturday morning the Prisoner came , and said he believed his Master had a suspicion of it ; I desired he would throw himself at his Master 's feet , and implore his mercy ; he said , I shall be too much dishonoured by that ; he shewed me the buckle , and said , where he had that , he might have taken a great many more , but his heart misgave him : so I went to Mr. Masham 's house , and acquainted his butler with it . Samuel Orton . I am a Pawn-broker ; I know very little of the Prisoner ; my dealings were with Mr. Augier ; those cloaths which I delivered to his Honour , I had a suspicion were not Augier 's own , so I sent my servant to his lodging , ( as I was told ) and there was the Gentleman dressed as a Gentleman of fortune ; and as Mr. Augier was a man of character , I took the cloaths to be the Prisoner 's own cloaths . Nicholas Augier , ( by an interpreter ) . The Prisoner used to bring some cloaths to me to pawn ; I remember a grey frock , in particular , with a gold lace [ this frock was produced , and proved to be Mr . Masham 's . ] There was a black velvet coat , a brocaded waistcoat , and several other rich apparel of Mr. Masham 's produced , which the Prisoner had brought to him to pawn ; and when he brought them he said they were cloaths his master had left off , and given to him . Joseph Parker . In March last Mr. Augier came to Mr. Orton 's , and brought a brocaded waistcoat to pawn . My master , knowing it was not Mr. Augier 's , he enquired whose it was . Mr. Augier said it was a Gentleman 's that lodged at his house ; my master sent me to enquire ; when I came there , I saw the Prisoner dressed like a Gentleman . I asked Mrs. Augier whether the Prisoner was a Gentleman , and lived upon his fortune ; then she talked to him in French , and she told me that he traded from France to England , and that he was a person of a good fortune , [ there was one of Mr. Masham 's waistcoats produced , which he said he saw the Prisoner wear ] . The Gentleman , who was sworn interpreter , informed the Court that the Prisoner said he had no intention to wrong his master , but he had lost some money at gaming , and in order to pay ( that which he called ) a debt of honour , he took those things of his master 's , and pawned them with a design to replace them ; he said , there are two houses in Covent-garden , one that goes by the name of My Lord 's , and the other , My Lady 's , but which it was he lost the money at , he ca n't tell ; that he pawned those things in order to retrieve himself , but could never do it : he said he had served his master honestly and faithfully for a considerable time ; and when he came over with his master from France , he had a gold watch , and had saved money in his service : he had no body in England to appear to his reputation but his master . He asked his master 's pardon , and assured him he had no intention to rob him . Mr. Masham . Till this discovery , I had no reason to think him a rogue , or to suspect him to be dishonest ; for I have trusted him with things of great value , and I never mistrusted him . Guilty , Death . Mr. Masham recommended him to the favour of the Court . 71 . + John Marshall , of St. Luke 's , was indicted for stealing two bird cages , value 2 s. four canary birds , value 20 s. and 4 l. in money , the property of John Smith , in his dwelling-house , Sept. 7 . 1743 . John Smith . The prisoner lodged with me eight or nine months , about three years ago , and was willing to do any thing in the house ; and when I moved ( as he was a Carpenter ) I employ 'd him to move my goods . I lost in August and September was twelve months , seven or eight pounds out of my till , for sometimes I left the keys in the till . Once in September was twelve months , when I went up to lay down , the Prisoner came to my bed side , when he thought I was asleep , and took the keys out of my pocket ; I went down after him , and saw him pull out the drawer of the till , put his hand into it , take part of the money out , and put it into his coat pocket ; said I , John , what do you with the money ? he said he wanted to change half a guinea ; I asked him where the half guinea was ; he said , D - n you , do you think I am a thief ? then he threw the money into the till , and a tooth pick case along with the money . About two years ago I made him a present of two birds and two small cages ; I went to his mother 's house , and saw five hang up in the kitchen : I got a search warrant , and found three cages , which was one more than I gave him ; one of the three was mine . One John Rogers told me he had a cage and two birds which were mine ; I found one of my cages and one bird which I could swear to , but I would not , because he had pulled the feathers off : those two birds that I lost cost me thirty-five shillings , they were for breeding . About two years ago , when I had a sit of illness , I lost a matter of ten pounds - I ca n't say that I lost any money when I catched him at the till , for he threw it in again . When he found I was going to indict him , he put me into the Crown ; and at a house in Palace Yard he jumped out at the window to get away from me . Coun . Ha n't you had some quarrel with him ? Smith . Never but when I bid him get out of the house , and never come in again . Coun . Did you ever trust him to receive money ? Smith . I never did . Q . When he took the keys out of your pocket , was your coat on or off ? Smith . It lay by my bed-side . John Bray . I have seen the Prisoner frequently at Mr. Smith 's till , and take money out . Q . How came you to see him take money out of another person 's till , and not discover it ? Bray . I did not know how affairs stood between Mr. Smith and him ; he said , he had part of the trade with Mr. Smith . Prisoner . Did not you buy a bird of one Scot to make me a present of ? Smith . Yes , and you had it - it was in a little gilded cage , but one bird could not be in two cages . Prisoner . The bird you gave me died , and you made me a present of two more . These birds were sent to my father 's house in order to breed , and you desired I would come to your house to make a partition for your birds . Smith . Your tongue is very smooth , John . Sarah Wrench . I was servant with Mr. Smith when the Prisoner lived in the house ; he was there till they quarrelled . Q . What did they quarrel about ? Wrench . My master said he lost his money every day , and had not money to pay his distiller . I said , who should you look to for your money but Marshall ; you trust him to take money for beer and liquors ; ( for my master never trusted me with the keys ) and last Monday was three weeks Mr. Smith came to me , and said , I must right him , and clear myself ; and if I did not appear as an evidence against the Prisoner , he would indict me next Sessions . Alexander Cowan , ( Constable ) I found this cage in a little room at the Prisoner 's father 's ; [ this cage was claimed by Mr. Smith as his property . ] Prisoner . Did not the place appear to be fit for breeding birds ? Cowan . Yes , it was fit for that purpose ; there were nets round the windows . Prisoner . I believe Mr. Smith through his malice is capable of swearing any thing ; and I do assure your Lordship , I am not guilty of the fact that is laid to my charge ; and if your Lordship will give me leave , I shall bring such witnesses as will satisfy your Lordship that I am innocent . James Pickersgill . I was employed about six weeks ago by Mr. Smith to take the Prisoner , and I took him by the Hermitage ; he desired to go to a friend 's house , I went with him , and in going along he made his escape from me , went over some pales , and got into an empty house , where there was only one inhabitant . Q. I thought you said it was an empty house ? Pickersgill . There were some women came into the house and threatened to kill me , and one man with a carpenter 's saw threatened to knock me down . James Buck . I am subpoena 'd both by the king and the Prisoner . The Prisoner indicted the Prosecutor for an assault , it was tried in the Sittings after last Trinity Term , and there was a verdict given for the Prisoner at the bar ; I was with him in Old Palace Yard , and he appeared publicly with his witnesses , while he was carrying on the prosecution against Smith . The Prosecutor ( Smith ) had spoke several hard words against the Prisoner , and he was advised to get out at the window to avoid being abused , and he did go out at the window . Mary Marshall . I am the Prisoner 's mother-inlaw ; a man came to me the 7th of March last with a search warrant to search for these birds , the birds had been at my house a year and an half , and Mr. Smith has been at our house twenty times since , and my son has sent for him to look at the birds when they were not well ; ( indeed he did keep from my house , because Mr. Smith threatened to arrest him for twenty pounds for board ) he has taken the cages down twenty times , and looked at the birds . Q . Did he ever complain of their being stolen ? Marshall . No , never . Prosecutor . I would only ask in what manner the Prisoner has lived these three or four years last past ? Marshall . He has worked sometimes wit h his father who is a carpenter , and if he had not spent so much time with Mr. Smith , it would have been better for him . Mrs. Rogers . Mr. Smith used to come frequently to the Prisoner 's father 's , and there were three or four cages hanging up , and he saw them ; he came in a friendly manner . Barbara Rogers I live at Lambeth . Last good Friday , Mr. Smith came to my house with a search-warrant , to look for birds and bird cages ; he found one bird and two bird cages , which he said were his , and he said he would indict my son , for receiving stolen goods , and that he would prosecute , and persecute any body who dared to entertain the Prisoner , or take his part , even to death ; and as for the old rogue his father , and the jade his mother-in-law , he had not done with them yet , as they should find ; that he would make that villain [ the Prisoner ] run his Country , and if he got him in goal , he would take care to keep him there . Mr. Smith bid me not be frightened , for he did not intend to do me any harm ; if I would produce the Prisoner ; and make him give him a general release , which he knew was in my power to do : he said , Marshal had put him in the crown , and he was resolved to have his life for it , without he came to an agreement , and acquit him from the indictment ; and he said he would be the ruin of me . He insisted upon my finding the birds out , and if I did not , he would swear they were stolen out of his house , and he would prosecute me . I believe the Prisoner to be a very honest man , and if I had not thought so , I would not have let him have been in my house . I am certain he has had opportunities , that would have been more advantageous to him , than these trisling affairs . He did keep out of the way , not on account of this indictment of Mr. Smith 's , but only for fear of being arrested . Acquitted . The court granted the Prisoner a copy of his indictment . 72 . 73. Rachael Merttins and Elizabeth Ludford , of St. John 's Hackney , were indicted for stealing a Moidore , value 27 s. and 7 s. and 4 d. in money , the property of Anthony Ford , Nov. 18th . Mary Ford . I sell milk , I lost a moidore and 7 s. and 4 d. in half pence , out of a closet in the kitchen ; the closet door was locked when I went out , about half an hour after four in the afternoon ; and when I came back it was open , and the money gone , Ludford is my servant , I asked her who had been there , and she said Rachel Merttins - Merttins was sent for , she denied it for some time , but afterwards owned she had 7 s. 4 d. William Corne . I am a headborough . Mrs. Ford sent for me , and said , she had been robbed , and that she had a suspicion of Rachel Merttins : she was sent for , and came ; I asked her where the money was that she took ; she said , if I would go with her , she would show it me : I went with her , and as we were going along the street , she took out her pocket , and said , here 's the money ; said I , I thought it had been in a tin pot ; she said , she had taken it out of the tin pot , and had thrown the tin pot into a garden : she said , that Ludford had the moidore - Ludford did not confess any thing . John Stowart . I was in the house between four and five in the afternoon , and the Prisoners were whispering together , I said , there was no whispering , but there werelies ; and Merttins said , what business was that of mine , they bid me go out to play . I was gone about two or three minutes , and came in again ; and Merttins said , she had made some caps for Ludford , and was to have a shilling for making them , then they whispered ; I said again , there was no whispering , but there were lies : then they bid me go out again ; I went to serve my cows , and staid about a quarter of an hour . Rachel Merttins 's husband came in , and gave her a kick , and soon after she went out . Mertins . I had this money from Ludford , but did not know that it was stolen . Merttins Guilty 10 d. Ludford Acquitted . [ Whipping . See summary . ] 74 . 75. Mary White and Mary Williams , of Christ Church Spittle-fields , were indicted for stealing a copper pot , value 4 s. 6 d. a copper coffee pot , value 4 s. five brass candlesticks , value 6 s. and ten pound of old brass , value 6 s. the goods of Isaac Tolke , Oct. 31st . Isaac Tolke . Mary White is my apprentice she is about fourteen years of age . On the 31st of October I came down sooner than ordinary ; she was up before me , and gone out : I saw the shutters down , ( which are very heavy ; ) I was very much surprised ; I called her , and went out , but could not see her . I spoke to my housekeeper , and told her , I had missed some candlesticks , which I put in my self at night , and which were chained to some others upon a table ; she said , it was no strange thing . Some time after my apprentice came in ; I asked her what became of such things , she said , if I would not hurt her , she would tell me what she had taken ; I told her , I would not hurt her , and she told me : I asked her , who was concerned with her , she said , Black Moll , [ the other Prisoner : she belongs to a person who sells fruit in the market . ] The person she sold the things to one Frances Nevit , facing White-Lion yard in Bishopsgate street : she said , she sold the copper drinking pot for a shilling ; the copper coffee pot for eight pence , and three candlesticks for a shilling . Another time she sold some old brass for six-pence , ( Black Moll went with her to sell the things , ) and she gave another person they call Good Sense three pence of the money . I got a search warrant , and found some of the brass candlesticks in Nevil 's shop ; I took up Mary Williams in Duke 's place , and she confessed she went with my girl to Nevil 's to sell the things , and had part of the money ; and that she waited in the alley , and bid my girl take the things : she said she had 8 d. out of the first shilling , that the pot was sold for , and six-pence out of the next 8 d. the remainder my girl had . Mary White made a voluntary confession before the Justice ; which was reduced into writing , wherein she acknowledged the stealingthese things , and that they were sold to Frances Nevil , next door to the King and Queen in Bishopsgate street for 2 s. 8 d. The Constable said , that Williams owned she was with Mary White when she sold them , and had part of the money . Bridger Lamb deposed , that Williams made the beforementioned confession . Mary Williams . The Prosecutor used all the means he could to make me confess , and said , if I was afraid of taking a false oath , I was very strict ; for I had better hang an hundred persons than myself , and desired I would confess ; and because I would not turn evidence , he said I should be tried for it myself . Tolke . I never gave her any other encouragement , than telling her , if she confessed it would be the better for her . Both guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 76. Martha Kirby , of St. Mary , Whitechapel , was indicted for stealing a camblet gown , value 20 s. and a velvet mantelet , value 15 s. the goods of Enoch Wharton , Nov. 9 . Enoch Wharton . I live in chambers in Goodman 's Fields ; on the 9th of November , between one and two , the neighbours called to me , and said a woman had taken something out of the window . I asked her what she had got , she said , nothing of mine . I took her into the house , and searched her , and found the things upon her : then she said a good woman had put them into her lap . Charles Brookin . I live over against the Prosecutor , I saw the Prisoner put her hand into the parlour window , and stoop : I did not see her take any thing out , but I saw something red in her lap . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 77. Mary Kemp , of St. George , Middlesex , was indicted for stealing a tea-kettle , value 2 s. 6 d. a laced cap , value 2 s. a scarlet cloth cloak , value 2 s. a check 'd apron , value 1 s. and a shift , value 1 s. the goods of John Eastwood . Hannah Eastwood . I lost these things in April last , the Prisoner lodged in my house ; I had other lodgers , but missing several things , I turned them away ; when they were gone I looked over my things , and missing more I charged her with them ; said I , no body can have them but you ; she sell a crying , and said , if I would forgive her , she would bring me my mob in a very little time ; she brought the mob , and said she would bring the rest the next day . I missed a tea-kettle the day following , and before I came down she had put on my cloak , apron , and shift , and went away ; I found her that night near Bond-street , and she had all the things upon her back ; when I asked her for the things , she run out into the street , and said , D - n you , you b - h , if you offer to touch me , I 'll swear a street robbery against you , and buy twenty times as much with the reward . I found her afterwards in Covent garden , with the apron on , but she had made away with the shift ; I asked her what made her take the things , and she said she took them to dress herself up to be a whore , called me b - h , and used me very ill ; I never went after her any more , for she belonged to a gang that I was afraid of ; one who lodged in my house saw her come into a pawn broker 's , where she had pawned my tea-kettle , and borrow six-pence more upon it . Joseph Copp . The Prosecutrix is a very bad woman , and makes it her business to indict people to extort money from them ; she bears such a character , that she is not to be believed upon oath , and I have witnesses to prove it . I have known the Prisoner from a child , and her parents were honest , creditable people . Hannah Ireson . The Prisoner lived with me ; I am sensible she was indicted , because the Prosecutrix could not get her to swear for her in her base Prosecutions : she bears as vile a character as any woman in England , and the Prisoner bears a very good character . Kemp guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] + 78 . 79 . 80 . 81 . 82 . 83. William Norwill , otherwise Long Will , William Billingsly , otherwise Gugg , Joseph Field , otherwise Nobby , Thomas Wells , otherwise Kitt , John Potbury , otherwise Jack the Sailor , and Henry Gadd * , otherwise Scampey , of St. Botolph Bishopsgate , were indicted ( together with Samuel Bannister , William Norman , John Neale , and Richard Morris not yet taken , ) for assaulting Edward Jones , on the King 's Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a silver watch , value 50s . and a steel seal , value , 1 s. Sep. 28th . * Henry Gadd was reputed to be an Apprentice to Joseph Field in this Employment . Edward Jones On Sept. the 28th as I was going along Devonshire street near Bishopsgate , about ten minutes after eight at night , I was robbed of a silver watch . Q . By what number of people ? Jones . Eleven or twelve people husled me , and pinned me up against a wall , and a little youth , about as high as my navel , took my watch out of my pocket - It was a lad about the size of the little boy at the bar [ Gadd ] I am pretty well assured it is him , but I ca n't be positive . There was one little fellow ( I think it was Jack the Sailor ) , who said , You dog , or D - n you you Dog , I 'll peg you ; and gave me a little blow , but did not hurt me - I ca n't be positive to any of them , because it was in the dark . I was sent for to Bridewell , and they informed me there was one they called , the Old Man , who was turned evidence ; I went to him to the Poultry Compter , and he told me who they were that robbed me . Field . I desire he may be asked what circumstances he has to know that any of us were concerned in the robbery . Jury . Was Field the person that struck you ? Jones . That little chap , [ Potbury ] I saw something of his face by the light of the lamps , and I believe he is the person - they husled me up , and I said , Gentlemen , what do you mean by husling me ? and I cried out , Thieves , and murder ! Then one of them cried out , Coach ; one called out one thing , and another another thing : they made a noise like a parcel of ravening wolves . I did not imagine that a robbery was committed ; it was done in a quarter of a minute , and then they went about their business . I thought they had been a parcel of srolicksome young sparks ; I did not think they were street robbers . William Harper . On the 28th of September , the Prisoners at the Bar , Jack Neale , Richard Morris , William Norman , Samuel Bannister , and myself , went from Chick-lane to Jack Neale 's , and in our way we took a watch from a gentleman ; from thence we went into Devonshire-street , and met this gentleman : I ca n't say , the Prosecutor is the person ; because it was dark ; and Jack the Sailor took a watch out of his pocket . Q . Had they any cutlasses ? Harper . They had cutlasses . Q . Had Gadd a cutlass ? Harper . Yes ; it was an old one of one Samuel Sonee 's , ( which was broke ) who is not taken yet ; the Gentleman cried out , Thieves , and we went into Devonshire-street , and cried out , Coach ; we all made a noise , that the people might not hear him . Q . How many of them had cutlees ? Harper . Bannister , Norman , and Morris had . Q . Had Field a cutlass ? Harper . He had not one then ; I believe he never carried one , for he used to tell them it was wrong to cut and slash People after they had robbed them . Q . Had you a cudass ? Harper . I never carried a cutlass or pistol ; Billingsly , Potbury , and Wells , used to cut and abuse People , and threaten to murder them . Q . Have not you heard Field complain of their cruelty in cutting People in that manner ? Harper . Yes , I have ; and I have heard him say they were worse than Blewitt and Frasier , to cut and slash people in that manner ; and told them , if they did so , he would not go with them , and he often persuaded them from it ; they were angry with him because he would not buy a hanger , and he used to tell them he had no money ; when he had money they told him , you have money now , why do n't you buy one ? but he made some excuse , and would not buy one , because he did not approve of their proceedings . He frequently told them , is it not enough to rob people without cutting and hacking them ? We went that night into Goodman's-fields , and took another Gentleman 's watch , but they did not strike him because the man was pretty easy , and went away about his business ; then we came up Rosemary-lane , and coming towards Aldgate they attacked another man , but they did not rob him because some people came out of their shops , and we were pursued . Wells had a horse pistol that belonged to Jack the Sailor ; he said , shall I fire at them , he turned about and fired , and they all left us . Prisoner Field . I said to the evidence Harper , how came you to put me into the information , when you know I am not guilty ? He said , he had given his information , and he could not help it . Said I , would you send your soul to the devil , to take away the lives of so many poor innocent People ? the Thief-takers make a trade of it , and do it for the sake of the reward . William Day ( Beadle of Portsoken Ward ) on the 28th of September , between nine and ten at night , hearing a noise in the street , and a cry of Stop thief , I went out , saw several fellows , and catched at one of them , upon which he cut at me two or three times ; I got my hat and staff , and called out , Thieves , murder , Thieves , murder ; one of them , a tallish Person , presented a pistol at me , and fired ; I stooped , and it happened to miss me . Q. to Harper . Who fired the pistol ? Harper . Wells did . Jury . Had any of the others a pistol ? Harper . I believe Jack the Sailor had one , but it was a pocket-pistol , the pistol that Wells had belonged to Jack the Sailor . Q . What day of the week was this ? Harper . It was on a Friday night . Day . It was on a Friday night ; there was one Rosse stopped that night , and I hearing an outcry went after them ; Mr. Rosse was not robbed , but there was one Mr. Winwood robbed that night . Q . Had you ever any conversation with Harper ? Day . No , never . Q . How came you to be here ? Day . I am here upon a subpoena upon another account . Q . Ask him what circumstance he came upon to day ? Day . There was a watchman killed in August last , and I understood that the person who is charged with that fact , was to surrender himself to day . I attend upon that account . Harper . Billingsly and Jack the Sailor were generally very cruel ; for if a person did but turn about to look at them , they would knock them down : there was a piece of a skull taken out of a man 's head , occasioned by a blow that they gave him , which would surprize you if you were to look at it . Wells . I do n't know any thing of him . Harper . What , do n't you know me ? Wells . No , I know nothing of you . Harper . Do n't you remember when you went to the Windmill in Cow-cross , in order to kill Mr. Jones the City Marshall , and Mr. Broomer ? Wells . No . Josiah Risby . I live in St. John's-street ; I am a Carpenter : Joseph Field was bound Apprentice to me in the year 1738 , and served four years of his time with me ; he thought he could get into a place where he might learn more than he could with me , as I am chiefly in the jobbing way ; he said he wanted to learn framing , and wanted to go away ; I told him he should go if he could get a Master , but he did not ; he afterwards grew uneasy , and he went away , - this is between two and three years ago ; - he never did me any injury during the time he lived with me , or any person that I worked for ; since he has been gone I have heard he has been sometimes with his Aunt , and sometimes in the Country , but how he spent his time I ca n't tell ; 't is a pity he has brought himself under this unhappiness . Hannah Holt . I have known the Prisoner ever since he was born ; he was born at Hitchin in Hertfordshire , and came of a very good family . Q . Are you any relation to him ? Holt . I am his own aunt ; I do n't know any harm of him , he had a very good character in the country , and is as honest a young fellow as ever was born , for what I know . Q . How has he lived lately ? Holt . Really I ca n't tell . Field . I worked three qu arters of a year with one Mr. Austin in the country , and at Sir Danvers Osburne 's house near Cliston , and at a Lady 's at Hutton . Q. to Mrs. Holt . Has he lain at your house lately ? Holt . No , he has not ; - he has not within these three or four months . All Guilty , Death . The Jury , on account of Joseph Field 's being of a more merciful disposition than his companions , and endeavouring to prevent their cruelty in cutting , and otherwise abusing the Persons they robbed , begged the favour of the Court to recommend him to his Majesty for mercy . Joseph Field , otherwise Nobby , William Billingsly , otherwise Gugg , Thomas Wells , otherwise Kitt , John Potbury , otherwise Jack the Sailor , and Henry Gadd , otherwise Scampey , were indicted ( together with William Norman , otherwise Party , Thomas Giles , otherwise Chimpin , Samuel Bannister , and Richard Mozris , otherwise Irishman , not yet taken ) for assaulting Thomas Pestell , on the King 's highway , in the Parish of St. Lawrence Jury , putting him in fear , & c. and taking from him a gold watch , value 12 l. a gold chain , value 30 s. and two Cornelian seals set in gold , value 10 s. his property , Sept. 22 . They were also indicted ( together with the aforementioned persons not yet taken ) for assaulting William Vanham on the King 's highway , in the same Parish , putting him in fear , & c. and taking from him a watch , value 5 l. a metal chain , value 5 s. and a Cornelian seal , value 5 s. his property , Sept 22 . As the Prisoners were all capitally convicted upon other indictments , they were not tried upon these . 84. William Turbutt , of St. Giles in the Fields , was indicted for receiving a silver watch , of the value of 50 s. ( which William Brister , Theophilus Watson , James Roberts , John Potbury , William Billingsly , and Henry Gadd , were this Sessions severally convicted of stealing from the person of Joseph Underwood , on the King 's highway , Aug . 24 . ) knowing it to be stolen , Aug. 28 . William Harper . I know the prisoner very well , - he lives in Sharp's-alley . Q . What business is he ? Harper . The same business as we are . Q . What is that ? Harper . A Thief . Q . Did he go out a thieving ? Harper . Yes , but not along with us ; but I have seen him with others , they did it in a more genteel manner than we did . Q . What ! was he above you ? Harper . Yes , a great deal . Q . Had you ever any dealings with him ? Harper . Yes , about eleven weeks ago we got in one night seven watches , three gold ones , three silver ones , and a Pinchbeck : we got one in Charter-house-lane , one in Aldersgate-street , two in King-street , another in Fenchurch-street , and that man got his arm cut . - We sold these watches to Turbutt the Prisoner the next day , we went to him in the morning , and he bid us thirty-two guineas for the seven ; we thought it was too little , so we went to three Jews in Duke's-place ( I do n't know their names ) and they would give us three pounds an ounce for the gold , but they would not give us any thing for the work ; so we went back again to the Prisoner , because thirty-two guineas were better than thirty pounds . We went to one Jack Neale 's who lived in the alley , and from thence to one Tom Giles 's house , and the Prisoner gave us the thirty-two guineas - he gave the money to Tom Giles ( one who is not taken yet ) and it was divided in Cross-lane in Holborn ; we divided three guineas apiece among ten of us , and the rest of the money was spent at the Horse and Groom in Crosslane . Q . Then he gave you a good price ; do you think he knew how you came by them ? Harper . He knew what we were , and how we came by them ; for he went a picking of pockets with me two years ago : when he paid us for the watches , he said we were very hard with him , and ought to give him a bottle of wine . Q. I suppose you appeared like gentlemen ? Harper . We appeared as we could ; sometimes we had a shirt , and sometimes ne'er an one . Q . How were you dressed then ? Harper . Some were dressed clean , and some were in a ragged dress . Q . Did you make any difference between a Sunday , and a working-day ? Harper . I never did . Q . Did you at any other time sell him any more ? Harper . The Sunday following we sold him six watches more , four silver ones , a gold one , and a Pinchbeck ; we sold them for twelve guineas . Q . This was a good week ; how much money had you left out of this ? Harper . Perhaps never a peny the next morning . Some had money left , and some had none ; and may be never a shirt - we used to play with one another ; and if we lost , those that won would not give the losers a drop of gin to save their lives , unless they liked them very well . There was a sword among these watches , and the Prisoner said , as he gave us twelve guineas for the watches , we must give him the sword ; but I think at last he gave us two shillings , or half a crown for the sword : he said he would wear that himself - There were all ten of us present at the selling this parcel . Q . Did you ask one another 's leave who should take the money ? Harper . We did not use to rob one another in this way ; we used to sink upon one another sometimes ; that is , wrong one another privately . Prisoner . I never bought a watch of them in my life , and never concerned myself with any of them . I know them no otherwise , than by their going by my door . Harper . I have known him four years , and used to go with him picking pockets privately in the streets , and at the playhouse . Q . Was not there a watch stolen on Bartholomew day ? Harper . Yes . Q . What was that sold for ? Harper . It was sold for twenty-eight shillings ? Q . Who was that sold to ? Harper to the Prisoner - The watch we took from Mr. Underwood we sold to the Prisoner , on the 28th of August . Prisoner . I keep a house in Sharp's-alley by Cowcross , and pay seven pounds ten shillings a year , and deal in horses . I go to Smithfield every Friday , and work as hard as any young fellow in England . I have a stable in Sharp's-alley that holds two horses - I have had but two or three lately . William King . I live with Mr. Downs , a dealer in horses . I have known the Prisoner these four years ; I have seen him at several country fairs buying horses , and often in Smithfield : I know no otherwise but that he is a very honest fellow , and I take him to be so .

John Barbe . I am a silversmith by the Seven Dials ; on the 19th of November the prisoners came into my shop , and asked for some silver spoons , I told them I had none , but should the next day ; they asked me to shew them a pair of falts which hung up in the window , ( I had the piece of silver in question in my hand , for I was looking whether it had any flaws , and laid it down on the work board . ) I had no suspicion of them because they were well dressed ; she took it into her hand , whispered two or three words to him , and then found fault with the plate : he said he was a Hamburgh merchant , and exported a great deal of plate , and desired I would give him a direction where I lived ; the woman went away in about two minutes , and the man desired I would come and drink with him in the neighbourhood ; I desired him to drink at my house , but he refused it ; when I had put the salts up I missed the skillet of silver , and no body had been in the shop but them ; I got information of them that night , and found them the next night at the Black Boy and Trumpet on Tower-hill ; they denied that they knew any thing of the matter ; the woman owned she was in the shop , but the man denied it . I never heard of the silver again . Benjamin Harper . Mr. Barbe told me he had lost a skillet of silver , and desired I would go with him to see after the Prisoners ; he , his man and I , took a couple of daggers , or swords , or cutlasses , and went to the Black Boy and Trumpet on Tower-hill : Woolf was there ; when Mr. Barbe spoke to him , he said he never saw him before with his eyes ; I left Woolf in custody , and found the woman [ Moses ] at her own lodging about seven or eight at night ; her landlord at first denied that she was at home , and did not care to let us in , but I said I had a search warrant , forced open the door , and went up stairs : she was unwilling to open the door at first ; when I went in I asked her whether she was not at the Seven Dials ; she said , yes , she went to buy a pair of salts ; she denied that she knew any thing of the silver ; she said before the Justice she did not know but she might be there , or she might not be there . John Gray . I am Mr. Barbe 's Apprentice ; the Prisoners were at our shop ; I was left in charge of Woolf at the Black Boy and Trumpet ; he delivered some keys and a watch to his Landlord : the watch has since been owned . Richard Sell . I have known the Prisoners about three or four months , - I do n't know what character they have , I only know them by their calling for a pint of beer now and then . John Faire . I have known Woolf ever since he came to England , my mother kept a public house , he used it all that time , I never heard any thing amiss of him . Barbara Page . I have known the Prisoner twelve months and better ; he has frequented my house many a time ; I never saw any thing that was amiss by him : I have seen the woman at different times , and never saw any thing but what was fair and just ; I never had any dealings with her . Acquitted . 87 , 88 . + Benj . David Woolf , and Hannah Moses , otherwise Samuel , were indicted for stealing a gold ring with a ruby stone , and two diamond stones set in the same , value 4 l. 4 s. the property of John Deval , in his dwelling-house , November the 10th . John Deval . I am a Jeweller in Throgmorton-street ; about six weeks ago the Prisoners came under presence of buying jewels of different sorts : Woolf looked upon some seals , and Moses looked upon some rings ; I saw that she put one of the rings upon her finger , and put her hand towards her breast ; I thought she was going to put it into her bosom , so I caught her by the hand , and she let the ring fall again into the drawer ; then I desired them both to be gone out of my house ; the man said he had no intention to steal any thing , and would buy to the value of twenty five or twenty six pounds in seals and rings , which he had looked out , and desired I would send them and the bill of parcels to the Rainbow Coffee-house in Cornhill , ask for one Bourne , and he would pay the money , but I saw very well what sort of People they were , and I would not send them . My man followed them to the King 's Jeweller , and informed them what sort of People they were , and they turned them out of doors . Acquitted . 89 , 90 . + Benj . David Woolf , and Hannah Moses , otherwise Samuel , were indicted for stealing a silver watch , value 3 l. 3 s. the property of Joseph Higginson , in his shop , Aug. 25 . Sarah Higginson . My husband is a watch-maker in Shadwell : in August last , just before Bartholomew day , the Prisoners came into the shop about twelve o'clock , and said they wanted some watches to go over sea ; I said I had none that would come under three guineas , or three guineas and an half ; they desired to see them , and I shewed them eight or nine . I delivered them to the man [ Woolf ] and he delivered them to the woman . My husband was abroad : Woolf asked me what time he would be at home ; I said he had ordered dinner to be ready about two o'clock , and I expected him home then ; they desired I would lay them by , and if there were any that suited them , they would come again at two o'clock ; they hung some up , and I hung some up . - I did not miss any then , for I was so inadvertent as not to mind how many I shewed them , but I found afterwards that I had lost one . Q . Was there any body came into the shop till you missed the watch ? Higginson . No , no body I am sure , for I was not out of the shop ; I never heard of the watch again till it was advertised by Sir Thomas Deveil . Benjamin Harper . When Mr Barbe went to look after his silver , I went along with him to see for the prisoners , and Woolf gave his landlord a watch ; the next night we had a search warrant , and I found the watch at Woolf 's lodging , I asked his landlord for the watch Woolf 's had given him the night before , and said I must have it : [ the watch was produced by Sir Thomas Deveil 's clerk ] I believe this is the watch . - I am very positive 't is the watch , for there was no mark or number to it , and I thought it had been made for the Jews upon that account . Woolf . Harper says the watch was found in my lodging , but it was not found in my lodging . John Lang . I made these cases for Mr. Higginson , here is my mark upon them . Cornelius Herbert . I finished this watch for Mr. Higginson the 11th of August last , and delivered it to him , and he paid me for it . Hannah Moses . I had this watch four years ago , and offered to sell it three quarters of a year ago . Woolf . I know this is her watch , and that she had it of her husband ; why should I go to spoil my credit , to rob her of her watch . Timothy Fagan . I have known Woolf about five months , and the woman about three months ; the two prisoners lodged in my house , and never kept late hours , nor were out early , and always behaved well . Q . How came you to turn Woolf out of your house ? Fagan . I did not turn him out . John Alexander . I am a Taylor , I have known Woolf these six years , and have worked for him ever since : I have left the work at his house , and he has paid me very honestly for it in a day or two . I let him have a watch to sell for me , and he brought it back again very honestly , and said he could not get so much for it as I would have . John Pattiman . Mr. Woolf lodged at my house , and always behaved civilly to me . John Faire . I have known Woolf four years , and never knew any harm of him in my life ; I have known him live three days upon a half-penny worth of bread , when he first came over . Woolf . He says the watch was finished in August ; I know the woman would have sold it three quarters of a year ago . Faire . I know Wolf would have sold me a silver watch , with the maker 's name Higginson upon it , about June last . Joseph Higginson . My watch had not the name of Higginson upon it ; it had only the name of Higgins ? Q . Why had your watch only the name of Higgins ? Higginson . Because I never put my name at length to any of my watches under six guineas . Q . Was the name on the watch that Woolf offered to sell you , Higgins or Higginson ? Faire . It was either Higgins or Higginson , I ca n't tell which . Woolf . I have got a receipt for this very watch . A receipt was produced , which appeared to be a receipt for another watch : the maker 's name Wilson . Guilty Death . 91 , 92 . + David Shaddows , and James Ruggles , of St. Martin 's in the fields , were indicted for assaulting John Church , in a certain open place near the King 's highway , called St. James 's Park , putting him in fear , & c. and taking from him a silver watch , value 40 s. a stock-buckle , value 5 and two shillings and two-pence halfpeny in money , his property , Sept. 17 . John Church . On the 17th of September I had been at Hide- park-corner about a little business and going from Hide-park to St. James 's Park , in order to go to Westminster , when I had got almost to the bottom of Constitution-hill , in the Middle Park , before you come to Buckingham-house , I was met by a person who called himself Brown to the best of my memory . Q . What time o'night was it ? Church . When these fellows light of me , it was not above half an hour after eight . Q . What did Brown say to you ? Church . I do n't know that he said any thing , unless that it was a fine evening . I did not much like him , and I walked the breadth of the table from the path , because I did not like him . In about a minute and an half , or two minutes time , I heard somebody running , and saw two persons running towards me . When they came up to me , I believe I could have thrown a stone to the bottom of Buckingham green-house . Q . Who were the persons that were running ? Church . The two Prisoners were both running , I think I can be sure to both of them , but I am sure Ruggles was one ; and I could swear to the other , but I do n't choose it . There were three of them came up to me ; they never said , Stand , and deliver ; but one of them , which I take to be Shaddows , stooped , and took hold of my two legs , and threw me down . Q . What did Ruggles do ? Church . I will not be positive what he did , but they threw me down upon my back , and beat me in a most violent manner . Q . Did they make use of sticks , or their fists ? Church . They made use of nothing but their fists , and I found them heavy enough , for they beat me so , that there was not such a spectacle seen : I had not an eye to see out of ; nor could I open my mouth to take in my victuals : and one of them choked me : I ca n't be positive who it was , but I think it was Ruggles . Then they laid hold of my side-pockets , and tore them off . After they had done that , they fell backwards , but did not fall quite to the ground . The man that was choking me , took my stock and stock-buckle off , and ran away to the rest ; they took a silver watch from me , and two shillings and two-pence halfpeny , which I had in my pocket , and went directly to Hide-park-corner - I have not had my watch , or any thing again . Shaddows . Do you know what day of the week it was ? Church . Yes , I do ; it was on a Monday . Shaddows . What time o'night was it ? Church . I have told that already . Shaddows . Do you know any thing of me ? Church . Only what I have said . Rowling Brown . The two Prisoners and I met Mr. Church , not where he says , by Constitution-hill , but in the park ; he was sitting upon a bench in the park , and I sat down by him , and falling into conversation , he said it was pleasanter walking than sitting , and asked if I would not take a walk . We walked in the middle of the park till we came to Buckingham wall , pretty near the ice-house , and then he began to meddle with me , and pulled out what he had , and put it into my hand , and wanted to feel what I had . I said , I believed there was a Molly . Shaddows and Ruggles came up , and we took him to the guard ; he ca n't deny it , if he tells the truth ; but I believe he was ashamed of it . We asked for his money , but he would not give it us ; and so thinking he would be ashamed of the thing , we took his watch and money from him - we knew it was an ill thing ; but we thought we had better take the watch and money , than expose him . Q . What did you go there for ? Brown . I did not go there for that purpose as some people go - we go to see who is there , and if we meet with any of these sort of people , if they have any money we take it from them . Church . I have received a threatening letter from them . Brown . You said you had received a threatening letter , but you said you believed it was from Jews . Q . If he offered such a thing as that to you , are you to rob him ? Church . Ask him if he knows whether I am a girl or a boy ? Brown . Yes , I do ; for you put what you had into my hand : I think I should know . Church . Do you know what I am ? Brown . I believe I know very well , and if you were to be searched , I could prove that I do . Q . When you adverticed your watch , why did not you advertise where you lost it ; for you advertised it to be lost in Germain-street . Church . I could have had half the parish of St. Giles 's to my character . Brown . He told me he was a joiner , and lived at Westminster . Church . You are such a rogue and a liar , that no body will believe you . He has made himself an evidence , I did not call him for a witness . One of the Jury said he had known Mr. Church three years , and that he was a man of a good character . Q . Are you sure Shaddows took you by the legs ? Church . I do n't chuse to swear to it . Q . You have sworn to Ruggles ; can you swear that Shaddows is the man ? Church . I believe as much one as the other , but I thought one was sufficient , so I would not swear to both . I verily believe he is the man .

Rowling Brown . About the 8th or 9th of April last , or thereabouts , Tho Cheworth , James Ruggles , John Smith , and my self , ( we all belong to one company ) were walking in St. James 's park between nine and ten o'clock at night ; Cheworth was got along with a Gentleman , and they took a walk into the Middle Park , upon the grass , by the corner of Buckingham-house , Ruggles , Smith , and I followed them , ( they were together for the space of two or three minutes , we knew what they were doing ) Cheworth said the Gentleman had hold of him by what he had ; we asked him what he meant by doing so , and we took from him a gold repeating watch , with a chain and two seals , five pence half-penny in money , and three iron keys ; I carried them home to my house , and kept the watch a day or two till it was advertised . Mr. Pepys , at the Crown and Sceptre in Fleetstreet , advertised it , with twenty guineas reward , and no questions asked . My wife and I went and received the twenty guineas for the watch : Cheworth was sent to the Savoy , and ordered to go to Flanders ; I found neither Ruggles nor Smith knew any thing of writing or reading , so as I ran the risque of carrying the watch , I saved eight guineas for my self , and divided the rest of the money . Smith , Ruggle , and I had three guineas and an half apiece : Cheworth had one guinea ; he was to have had half a guinea more , but I said my wife should have that for her trouble . There being no other evidence but the accomplices , the prisoners were Acquitted . 96 , 97 . + James Ruggles , and John Smith , were indicted for assaulting a certain man , to the Jurors unknown , in St. James 's park , and taking from him a gold watch , value 10 l. the property of the said man , to the Jurors unknown , August the 1st .

Rowling Brown . Some time in September I met a person ( I do n't know but he might be a Valet , or an Officer in a Marching Regiment ) about ten o'clock at night ; as we were walking together we fell into discourse ; he touched me two or three times upon the arm , and I went with him into the grove in the middle of the park by the deer , and then he offered to do in the same manner as the others had done before ; then John Smith came up , and we took his shoe buckles , knee buckles , and stock buckle ; Pinker and Jackson took his hat and wig . Jury . How was you dressed at that time ? Brown . I do n't know but I might be dressed as I am now , or in a light coloured coat , or a blue grey coat . Jury .

John Meakins . I lost my watch in the prisoner 's room ; I was with Rowling Brown and the prisoner . - I think I had it when I went into the room ; I missed my watch in the room , and told Rowling Brown directly that he had it ; he produced it in October last . - I took the prisoner to be a very honest man both before and since . John Child . On the 17th of October , Rowling Brown brought a watch to me , and pawned it for a guinea . Brown . On the 7th of June , Meakins helped me home with some cloaths which I had made for the company : he was very drunk , and said himself down ; I took hold of the ribbon of his watch , and pulled it out ; Doe desired I would not keep it ; I said he was drunk , and I would keep it , he should never have it any more : I put it into a tub of flour . Meakins enquired for his watch , and Doe and I said we did not know any thing of it , I pawned it for a guinea , ( it came in very good time , for my wife lay in ) and gave the prisoner ten shillings . I was taken up for it , and was obliged to give my information against the prisoner . Q . So you would hang the prisoner for your stealing the watch , and giving him ten shillings ? Brown . I would not have him hanged ; I only speak the truth , for indeed I took it . Acquitted 102 . + Elizabeth White , otherwise Wilks , of St. Botolph Aldgate , in Middlesex , was indicted for stealing a silver watch , value 50 s. and three shillings and six-pence in money , the property of Richard Parke , privately from his person , October 18 . Richard Parke . I am a shoemaker ; on the 18th of October , about five o'clock in the evening , I was going to buy some leather - I was a little in liquor I must own , but not so bad but I knew what I did . As I was going along Leadenhall-street , the Prisoner came and walked Check by Jole with me ; we went to King-street by Tower-hill ; then she said she was my cousin , and asked me to go home with her . I said I was resolved I would go and see how my new cousin lived , and I went home with her . I asked her what she would drink . She said she would have a pot of hot , and she asked for the money beforehand . I gave the Prisoner a shilling for the hot pot , I drank once , and she bid me drink heartily , but I would drink no more . Then I was talking of going home . When she heard me talk of going home , she let the bed down , and the bed 's feet touched the chair I sat upon . Then I got up , and thought I had better have got into better company than this , and insisted upon going home . She asked what it was o'clock . I pulled out my watch , and said it was just turned of five . I put my watch into a deep side-pocket , string and all : then I insisted upon going home , and I said I would go home . She said , No , I should not ; I should have another full pot of hot . I said , I would not have any more . Then she said herself down upon the bed , and pulled her clothes up ; and I laid myself down upon her . I was no sooner upon her , but her hands began to be at work ; they were soon in my pockets , and that soon cooled my courage , for I had not much then . Said I , Madam , what business has your hand in my pocket ? Then she drew her hand out , I took hold of her hand to open it , to see what she had got ; and while I was seeing whether she had got the watch , she drew the watch out with her left hand . Q . Did you feel the watch going out ? Parke . Yes , I did ; which made me look that way . I saw a bit of the string in her left hand , but I ca n't say I saw the watch : she took my money with the right hand - the money was in my left hand pocket , and my watch in my right hand pocket : as soon as I saw her hand draw back , I took hold of her right hand , and endeavoured to force it open . Q . Did you feel her hand in your pocket ? Parke . I ca n't say I did , but I felt it groping about my breeches . Q . Which was drawn out first , the watch , or the money ? Parke . The money was drawn out first . Q . Did you wrench her hand open ? Parke . I got one of her fingers open so far , that I could see the edge of a half-crown , and touched it ; but before I could get the money out of her hand , she with her left hand took my watch - I had half a crown and two shillings in my pocket ; one of them I gave for the hot pot , and then I had three shillings and six-pence left . I asked her where my watch and money were . She said my watch was dropped down by the side of the bed , and my money was upon the bed . She said , let me get up ; and as I was in a strange place I was afraid , and let her get up ; and she being cunninger than I , and more roguish than I , and a strong lusty woman , she pushed me down upon the bed ; I had my breeches to put up then , and while I was doing that , she made off both with my watch and money - the door was shut , and a chair set against it - it was at the desire of her servant that I prosecuted her ; for she said , it was a pity she should not be prosecuted . I did not design to have fought after her , but if I had met with her , I would have taken her up . Elizabeth Spencer . I was servant to the Prisoner in East Smithfield ; she gave me a shilling a week to go out with her with earthen ware . One Thursday night , about six weeks ago , she brought the Prosecutor into her own house ; I went for a pot of hot , and sat it down upon the table : the man said he must go , she desired him to stay a little longer , and asked him what it was o'clock . He pulled his watch out , and said it was between five and six . Then I went out of the room , and left them by themselves ; he shut the door , and set a chair against it . In a little time I heard the man cry out ; he said , she had got his money and watch . She said , she had not . Said he , Huffs , you have got the money in your hand now . I see the glimpse of a half-crown , says she ; let me get up , for your money is upon the bed , and your watch is dropped down by the bed-side . I was frightened , and went to the end of the court . I staid there about two or three minutes , and she came running out with her hat and cloak in her hand . I asked her where she was going . She said she was going to the Blue Anchor for a pot of beer for her cousin and she . I asked her whether she had given the man his watch and money . She said she found the money upon the quilt , and the watch was by the side of the bed . She went away , and hid herself somewhere ; and between twelve and one she knocked at the door , her husband was along with her ; she asked me whether the man made a noise about his watch . I said , Yes , he did . She sat down by the fire-side , pulled the watch out , and gave it to Harry White her husband . Then she went out again . Two days afterwards the man came about his watch ; ( they sold the goods off upon this account , and went away ) . I went to find her out , and found her at one Gore 's in Broad St. Giles 's . Then I went to the Prosecutor , and acquainted him where she was , ( for he had left me a note where to find him . ) They were taken up , Harry White was sent to Bridewell , and she to New-prison . Prisoner . I do n't know her . I have witnesses to swear , that I was sick in bed at that time , and that I never lived nor lodged in that place . Her mother is a common prostitute , and she is a very wicked girl , and has been so these six years . Parke . When she was at the Justice 's , she run after the girl , and said , You b - h , I 'll stick you ; have not I given you shoes and stockings , and clothes ; and have you done this for me ? Frances King . The Prisoner is a very honest person , she rises up early , and takes a great of pains to get her bread , she was sick of a fever and ague at that time , I live in Broad St. Giles 's , I buy and sell things at market , she lodged in my house a month before this goodman [ the prosecutor ] came to take her out of the house . [ she was committed the 23d of October . ] Q . Had she a house in East Smithfield ? Kinge . I believe she never had a house in her life , she was not capable of keeping one . Elizabeth Avery . I have known the prisoner between 8 and 9 years , she goes out to market early and sometimes lays out 10 or 30 s. in a morning , I never saw any harm of her , or that she was any ways quarrelsom and never saw any fellows come after her . I heard the girl [ Spencer ] say on Saturday in this yard to her uncle that she was afraid to go into court about this watch , and he said , do n't be afraid for if I receive the reward you shall be cloathed from head to foot , and I heard the prosecutor say this day that he bought her shoes and stockings on purpose to come here . Dinab Hagan . I heard the prosecutor say on Saturday , that he took the girl out of a baudy house and bought her shoes and stockings to come to be an evidence . Parke . The girl had hardly a shoe or a stocking to her feet and I was forced to buy her some or she could not have come here , but as to taking her out of a baudy house I did not . Guilty 10 d.

John Messenger . I am a farmer , I live near Kensington-Gravel-pits ; I lost 15 ewes , their throats were cut , their bellies ripped open , and the fat taken out . It was a very wet night , and the waters came down upon us that I could not go into the grounds that night , but the next night I found 15 ewes killed and there were 27 lambs upon the ground that were taken out of those ewes - they were killed either on the 7th of November at night , or on the 8th in the morning , we found them on the 9th , I was with the 2 prisoners at Sir Thomas Dever 's the Tuesday following , and they both confessed they killed my sheep . Q . What was it you heard either of them say ? Messenger . Bourke said he went into the field , and he with his father killed the sheep [ Ellis is Bourke 's father-in-law ] and he confessed that they sold the fat to one Samuel Chattle a tallow chandler in the Borough of Southwark for forty one shillings and two pence half peny - George Ellis did not say he killed them , but he said he was helping Bourke .

Were your sheep marked ? Messenger . Some were marked I W , and some were marked I with a rose , I bought the sheep marked , I never mark any . Joseph Agnew . I am a constable of St. James 's , I was upon duty on Friday the 9th of November ; George Ellis came and enquired for the constable of the night , I asked him what he wanted , he said there was a fellow in Tyburn Roard who had abused him very much and given him 2 black eyes ; said I , is that all ? it is a very great way to go upon such a trifling thing , and then he said he was a very great thief ; I bid him come into the watch-house , and asked him wherein he was a thief ; he said that on Wednesday night , the 7th of November that rainy night , he killed fourteen sheep in a field near Kensington Gravel-pits ; said I , how can you prove this ? he said , I can prove it , for I was concerned with him in doing it ; but he said , I would have you who came of your self , for he has got a large and a very dangerous our , and he is a dangerous fellow . I took three watchmen , and got some people to assist me , and went into Tyburn Road , and took Bourke in bed ; I turned the cloaths back , to see whether he had any knife in bed with him , but I could find none ; I looked under the bed , and found the knife just under the bed by the bed side at my feet , 'us a clasp knife , it was open , and there was so me fat upon it , there is some upon it now , [ the knife was produced , the blade is about four inches long ] . I found this fat in a closet in the room , Ellis told me that this fat , which was found in the closet , was part of the fat that was taken out of those sheep . I brought him to the watch-house , and Ellis carried the lanthorn to the watch-house ; I hand-cuffed Bourke behind his back , and locked him up ; I let Ellis sit in the watch house , but gave a charge that he should not go out upon any account : he told me they had killed a great number of sheep , at different places , about the time they killed those at Kensington , - he said they went out the 7th of November between eight and nine at night : on the 10th of November , about a quarter after six in the morning , the watch went off their duty , and Ellis took an opportunity to get away : between eleven and twelve on Saturday morning , I carried Bourke before Sir Thomas Deveil , and he owned the killing the twenty one sheep at Kensington Gravel-pits , the Wednesday before ; and on Saturday night , about ten o'clock , I took Bourke out of the same room and bed that I took Ellis out of , and he owned , before Sir Thomas Deveil , the killing twenty one sheep on Wednesday the 7th of November . Q . Did he own the doing it , or the aiding and assisting in the doing it ? Agnew . He said I aided and assisted him in the doing it , and he owned they sold the fat , the Friday following , for forty one shillings and two pence half-peny . Bourke . They kept us drunk all the time , to get us to confession : he gave me money to make me drunk . Andrew . I never gave him any money . Bourke . He gave me wine and punch , and made me drunk . Agnew . I went to him on Sunday , and took a friend with me : we had a bowl of punch , and I asked him to drink of it ; he said to me , I have no money for my lodging , I with , Sir , you would be so kind as to give me six pence , and I gave him six-pence , and that was all I gave him . Bourke . You gave me eighteen-pence , and a share of two bottles of wine , and two bottles of beer ; and you said there were two hundred pounds reward to say so and so to hang my father ; and you said , if you impeach any man that will be the same . Agnew . I did not say any thing of that upon my oath . I found this pair of dividers in Ellis 's pocket - he is a whitesmith . Mr. Brogden . Ellis was brought on the Saturday before Sir Thomas Deveil , and was committed for farther examination . Bourke signed his confession voluntarily , without any promises of favour , and Ellis said at the same time that he was concerned with Bourke in killing the twenty-one sheep . Patrick Bourke , in his confession , taken Nov. 13 , 1744. says , that in the night between Wednesday and Thursday , he , with Ellis and Conelly , killed about twenty-one sheep , the property of John Messenger , and Benjamin Banks the Elder , and took the fat , which he and his father sold to Samuel Chattle for about forty shillings : but as there was an account depending between Chattle and this examinant , they received no more than ten shillings and three-pence halfpeny apiece . Thomas Niccoll . I saw the Prisoners before Sir Thomas Deveil , and they owned they killed twenty-one sheep on the Wednesday night ; ( it was a very wet night , and the field lies very low , joining to a field of mine ) they said they did not carry the fat to the Tallow-chandler 's that night , but they carried it four or five fields off , and hid it , and afterwards carried it to a man over-against the Blue Maid in Southwark , and sold it to him . Bourke said there was one Conelly concerned with them ; and Ellis said , no , do n't go to hurt any body , for you know there was no body there but you and I. I said to him , I do n't want you to confess upon a promise of pardon , but only desire you to speak the truth . Guilty , Death . + They were also indicted for killing three weather sheep , value 30 s. and three ewe sheep , value 30 s. the goods of Benjamin Banks the elder , with intent to steal part of the carcasses , & c . November the 8th . + And also for killing ten ewe sheep , value 4 l. with the like intent , October the 27th . 105 . + William Harding , of St. Botolph without Aldgate , London Victualler , was indicted , for that he , together with Michael Burchall , James Diamond , Edward Morgan * , and divers other persons , to the Jurors unknown , upon James Sparkes , in the peace of God , & c. feloniously , wilfully , and of their malice aforethought , did make an assault ; and that he , the said Michael Burchall , with a certain wooden stick , which he had and held in his right hand , he the said James Sparkes , upon the backpart of the head , feloniously , wilfully , & c. did strike , giving him a mortal wound of the breadth of one inch , and the depth of a quarter of an inch , of which he languished from the said 21st day of August to the 7th day of September , on which said 7th day of September , the said James Sparkes , in the parish of St. Mary , Whitechapel , of the said mortal wound died ; and that they , the said James Diamond , William Harding , Edward Morgan , & c. were aiding , assisting , abetting , comforting , and maintaining the said Michael Burchall to commit the said murder ; and therefore that they , the said Michael Burchall , James Diamond , William Harding , Edward Morgan , and divers other persons , to the Jurors unknown , the said James Sparkes , feloniously , wilfully , and of their malice aforethought , did kill , and murder , against his Majesty 's peace , & c. * Edward Morgan was tried last Sessions for the same murder , and acquitted . See Page 257 . Trial 466 . There was no indictment against him on the Coroner 's inquisition . At the request of the Prisoner 's Council , the witnesses were examined apart . Thomas Dadley sworn . Q . What have you to say against the Prisoner , with relation to the murder of one James Sparkes ? Dadley . And please your honour , as to the murder of Sparkes , I can give no account ; for I was not present at the time he received his wounds . - I have nothing to say any farther ; I do n't know the Prisoner , nor I ca n't say I saw him there - The first beginning of the fray was this , on the 21st of August last , as I was beating the hour of eleven , about eight or ten persons came along , and one of them struck my lanthorn . I asked him why he struck my lanthorn ; and then another of them came up to me , gave me the cross buttock , and hove me down backwards : some of them , but I ca n't tell who , hit me with their canes or sticks . I called out for the watch , being just at the watch-house , and they came to my assistance . Cartwright ( one of the watchmen ) said , there 's one of them gone up Checquer-yard , let us follow him . When we went there they followed us , and there I lost my staff , and was cut over the hand , ( as I suppose with a hanger ) and I received a blow . Lancelot Howlett . After the blow was given to Sparkes , I went down almost to Mr. Rawlinson 's door , and saw Mr. Morgan flourishing a watchman 's staff - I do presume he took it away from some of our men . As Mr. Rawlinson was standing at his door , two or three of our men went towards him , with a design to hit him a blow . I said , do n't strike him , for I know who he is . We enquired if he knew any of them , and Mr. Rawlinson said , do n't be in a passion , and I 'll tell you who they are : one is Morgan , who lives in Whitechapel ; and another is Harding at Stepney - I know no more of the matter , only that James Sparkes , one of our watchmen , was wounded , and died of his wounds - I do n't know the Prisoner ; I will say no more than I know . Ebenczer Cartwright . On the 21st of August I was in the watchhouse , and heard an outcry of watch . I went out , and saw Dadley just by with several people striking at him ; I ca n't tell whether it was with sticks or cutlasses ; several of the sticks came over my head . I said to Dadley , there is one of them gone up Checquer-yard ; we will make sure of him . When we went up the yard , several of them came after us with staves and hangers , and knock 'd us both down : my head was cut in several places , and one Thomas Rawlinson said - Coun . You must not mention what he said . Cartwright . I desire you would remember what he said , for I am afraid he will forget himself - I do n't know any thing of the prisoner 's being there . Robert Robinson . - I do n't know any thing of the prisoner , I only heard his name mentioned as being there - I did not see any of the blows given . Eleanor Sparkes . My husband came home the 21st of August between 11 and 12 at night very much abused , and said he was a dead man - he repeated it to me several times afterwards that he should die of those wounds . Q . Did he say who were the authors of his murder , or any thing in relation to the prisoner ? Sparkes . He said the prisoner was just by him when he was wounded , and Mr. Morgan was ; but he could not tell who killed him . - A kinswoman of the deceased . The deceased was my uncle , I went to visit him in the Infirmary , he was sadly wounded , I asked him how he came into that miserable state , he told me he was wronged and abused by a parcel of men , who came in a riotous manner as he was upon his watch . I asked him if he knew any of those men who wounded him ; he said he knew three of the company ; I asked him who they were ; he said , Mr. Rawlinson was one , Mr. Harding at the Spring-Garden at Stepney , and Mr. Morgan in Whitechapel . I asked him if he could tell which of those men wounded him : he said , Mr. Morgan and Mr. Harding were the two nearest to him when he was wounded , but he could not tell which of them did it - he said this about six days after the thing happened . William Day . Upon Tuesday the 21st of August last ( as I am beadle of the ward ) I sat my watch according to custom and left the constable and all the watchmen sober ; the next morning I heard there had been a dismal affray , that the watchmen had been sadly used , and that the deceased and one Parker were dismally wounded , and I got them into the Infirmary ; therewere warrants granted to take up Harding and Morgan , for Sparkes had said that they were two of the company . Thomas Rawlinson . When the quarrel first began I was forty yards distant , and they ran down Checquer yard . Q . Who ran down Checquer yard ? Rawlinson . I saw Mr. Harding and one Diamond run down ; they were several yards down Checquer yard , and there was a cry of murder ; the other watchmen came to assist those who went down the yard . Mr. Burchall stood at the end of Checquer yard and drew his hanger , said I , for God 's sake do n't do anyharm with your hanger ; he said , by God I will fight for my king and my country . Q . Had the prisoner any weapon ? Rawlinson . I did not see any . Q . If he had had a cutlass or a weapon do you think you should have seen it ? Rawlinson . I could not see into Checquer yard . William Day . They have said that I wanted the reward + ; I might have taken the prisoner up but I scorned the reward . Arthur Parker . - I have nothing to say against the prisoner nor any body else ; I received several wounds , but I ca n't say who wounded me . Acquitted . The Court admonished the prisoner to take care of his behaviour for the future , and not to engage in any such affray , and recommended it to him to make all the satisfaction in his power to the widow of the deceased for the loss she had sustained . 106 . + Ann Collier , of St. James , Clerkenwell , was indicted for assaulting Alexander Forfar , on the King 's highway , putting him in fear , & c. and taking from him a silk handkerchief , value 2 s. a powder horn , value 18 d. his property , and a pistol , value 21 s. the property of Robert Montgomer , Sept. 24 . + A reward offered by the ward of Portsoken for apprehending any of the persons concerned in this affray . * Thomas Wells , Theophilus Watson , Joshua Barnes , Thomas Kirby , and Ann Duck , were tried last Sessions for this robbery , and acquitted . She was indicted then , but not taken . See Sessions paper , Part 1 . Page 229. Alexander Forfar . I am a Headborough : about ten at night ( I had been in bed ) Mr. Blewmire , my Constable , and Mr. Montgomery , called at my house and desired I would go with them to Blackboy-alley . Mr. Montgomery had a pair of pistols , and gave one to the Constable , and one to me ; we went into Black boy alley , to a house which I suppose to be one Field 's ; the Constable knocked at the door , and called several times , and said if they did not let him in , he would break the door open , and some people held cutlasses out of the window to terrify us , and then threw brick-bats , or anything they could get , at us : Mr. Montgomery went under a house to shelter himself , and the mob began to rise very much ; they began to shove me , and a fellow offered to fire at me , and I think I said , Fire away , if you miss me , I will not miss you . Every body was gone but Mr. Montgomery ; he drew his sword , and defended himself , and I took to my heels , and ran to Cow-cross ; Wells cut me over the head ; I struggled to keep my pistol as long as I could , but they cut my fingers , and got it out of my hand ; then the women came up , and among them the prisoner , she had a poker in her hand , and beat me with it very severely on my back and sides , stamped upon me , and took my handkerchief off my neck , which was tied in two knots , and then she said , D - n the dog , kill him . I had a powder horn taken from me , the handkerchief off my neck , and the pistol was taken from me ; I lost four shillings and six-pence , but I ca n't tell who took it ; I would not say so for ever so much if it was not true . - Ann Collier trod upon me , and took the handkerchief off my neck ; I am positive of it , and Ann Duck took the powder-horn out of my pocket . Q . Did you receive any wounds in this affray ? Forfar . I had a matter of forty wounds and bruises in this fray : I was stabbed in the shoulder , and had three cuts in one leg . Prisoner 's Council . Who took the pistol from you ? Forfar . I ca n't tell . Pris . Coun . You were asked on the last trial , whether ther you lost any thing but your powder-horn , and you said , No , nothing but my blood . Forsar . I said I lost my powder-horn , a handkerchief , and a pistol . Pris . Coun . You do n't pretend to say that the prisoner took any thing from you ? Forfar . She took a handkerchief from me ; I always said so : I said so when I was down upon the ground . Pris . Coun . There 's not one word of her name in the other trial . Q . Did you mention this woman on the former trial ? Forfar . Yes . Q . Did you name her upon that trial ? [ the prosecutor paused a little . ] Q . Did you , or did you not , name Ann Collier at all upon that trial ? Forsar . I ca n't say that I mentioned her any otherwise than as a person that was there - to the best of my knowledge I did name her . Pris . Coun . Did you say then , that she took your handkerchief ? Forsar . I believe I did not say so then ; I had no occasion , for she was not taken . Q . Was William Harper by when you lost your handkerchief ? Forsar . Yes , he was one of the mob . John Blakeman . At the time Mr. Forfar was cut , I saw Ann Collier with a poker in her hand . - I knew her very well ; I had seen her a great many times , and she is very remarkable to be known . - I did not see her do any thing ; she was in the middle of the mob . - I ca n't say she was near enough to the prosecutor to do any thing to him . I saw him down upon the ground , and helped to take him up : he was cut very much ; - he had no handkerchief on then . Richard Pack . I live at Cow-cross ; I was sitting by the fire-side , ( I think it was the 24th of September ) and heard a noise in the street ; I went out , and the people said that Montgomery and the Constable were attacked by the people of Black-boy-alley , and cut with hangers , ( they had done cutting then ) . I went among the mob , and saw Mr. Forfar was cut very much ; I said , Do n't kill the man , and the prisoner said , D - n him , you would serve him right if you cut his head off ; and one of them swung his hanger over his head , and said , You dog , I will learn you to come here to press men , I have a good mind to cut your head off , and if it was your master Blewmire , I would cut his head off . - I did not see that the prisoner had any thing in her hand , for she was among the people . I went home with Forfar , and he did not name any person that had robbed him but Ann Duck . Sarah Abbot . I saw the prisoner with a pistol in her hand the next day , and she said , G - d d - n his blood , I have beat him with his own weapon . - She did not say whose it was , or who she had beat with it . William Harper . I do n't know any thing of this affair , I was not there ; I was at the other end of the town , for if I had been there , I must have remembered it , because the damage done to the man is very remarkable ; and if I had I should have put it into my information : I never saw Forfar before he came to swear me into this robbery , ( he would have swore I robbed him of the pistol ) and I had never seen him in my life . Prosecutor 's Coun . How came you to remember the particular time ? Harper . I do n't remember it at all ; for I ca n't remember a thing that I never knew . John Brittain . As I was going home to my family , that night about ten o'clock , I was pressed , the officers used me very ill , and cut me with their cutlasses ; they carried me up to Cow-cross , at the time of this disturbance ; I did not see the Prisoner there , if she had been there I should have known her by her voice ; I saw no woman there but Ann Duck - there was no man cut and hacked , I did not see any one cut . Q . Was you pressed for a soldier ? Brittain . They laid hold of me as I was coming along ; I do n't know what they took me for . Coun . Not for a conjurer , I suppose . Brittain . I am a buckle-maker , and keep a house of ten pounds a year . John Blewmire . I went with Mr. Montgomery to Forfar 's , to take him with me to Black-boy-alley . He was buttoning his collar . Said I , Do n't stand buttoning your collar , come along . Montgomery had a naked sword , I had one pistol , and Forfar another . I went first into Field 's , at the fighting cocks , and afterwards to one Harry Gray 's , and bid them open the door . I said , if they did not , I would break it open ; but I could not get in . By and by there were brickbats , & c. thrown at us . I saw some of the fellows with cutlasses crying out for Blewmire , they said , they would cut my head off : and some , I suppose , who did not know me , took hold of Forfar instead of me . I pulled my wig off , and put it into my pocket , that they might not know me - I saw Forfar among them , but could not see what they did to him for the crowd . Prisoner 's Council . Was the Prisoner there , or was she not ? Blewmire . I ca n't say I saw her there all the time . Q . Did you see any thing upon Forfar 's neck ? Blewmire . I did not see any thing . Q . When you took Forsar out with you , had he a handkerchief or a stock about his neck ? Blewmire He had neither stock nor handkerchief on , for he was going to bed , and when he could walk and come abroad he asked who Ann Collier was , and what sort of a person she was . Q . Did he put a handkerchief on afterwards ? Blewmire . I did not see that he put it on all the time . Forsar . Blewmire wanted to make it up with me , with respect to Ann Collier for 20 pieces ; he said 20 pieces will do you no harm . Blewmire . I wish I may be hanged if ever I said any such thing . Richard Pack . ( Again . ) I heard Blewmire say to Forfar , Alook be as easy as you can , 20 pieces wo n't hurt you . Q . Did Blewmire mention Collier 's name ? Pack . Yes , he did , and Forsar said he was used ill , and had lost his handkerchief , his powder horn , a pistol and some money . Blewmire . Fofsar said now is the time , 't is near Christmas , if you have a mind for a piece of beef , we may keep Christmas well if Nan Collier was convicted , and a little matter will hang her . Q. to Forfar . Did you ever say the reward would serve to keep Christmas , and a little matter would hang her ? Forfar . I never did say so . Robert Marcrost . My name is Marcrost , though I am called Maycrost , I am a marshals court officer , I know Forfar to be a very wicked vile man in these things , for one William Harper was taken up on Lord Mayor 's day last ; and the day after Forsar came to the Castle in King-street by Guild-hall ( before Harper came ) and agreed to swear that Harper was at the riot , whether he was or was not , and that he had robbed him of the pistol . He says to me , Marcroft , do you know Harper ? I said , I thought I did . He said , Do you believe he lives in the alleys ? I said , I believe he does live in the alleys : but if you are not sure he is the man that robbed you , it would be hard to swear his life away . He said , No matter for that , 't is a bad place , the very sanction of Black-boy-alley will hang an hundred of them with very little evidence , no matter who swears . Forfar . Your character is so bad , that you may swear against an hundred persons , and not be believed in one thing . Marcrost . Then he said , what must I do with Nan Collier when I take her , for I am not positive to her , but by all accounts it must be her , for it was a lusty woman , and she is most likely to do such a thing , and afterwards he said he would swear it : he said it was worth while to prosecute her , and if he did not , some body else would , for there would be an hundred pieces for her by the late Proclamation . - I believe Forfar does this for the sake of the reward , and nothing else , for he is a very wicked man . He would have sworn this robbery against Lawes and Paine , if it had not been for me ; I advised him against it , and he said he would think farther of it . Prosecutor 's Council . Do you know the prisoner ? Marcrost . I had not seen her for some months , but as I am an Officer I had business that way sometimes ; the woman was pretty courteous to me : she did sell a dram , and I have spent three-pence in her house now and then , in return to her civility . Some years ago a person must have behaved very civilly to go through that place without some blows , even in the day-time . Q. to Forfar . Did you ever talk with Marcrost about the reward for Ann Collier ? Forfar . I never did ; the man was a stranger to me ; but when they were about taking the City 's money , I said , it is very hard you should take all the money for the reward , when I suffered so much , and I must have nothing . Marcroft and eleven more have entered into a combination to have all the rewards among themselves . Q . Did you ever mention to Marcroft any thing at all of Ann Collier ? Forfar . Not till after she was taken , but I never spoke to him about the reward . Mr. Boddy . Forfar had information of Collier 's being at Lambeth , and desired we would go and help him to take her ; I never saw her before that time - I never heard any thing amiss of Forsar in my life - he did not say any thing to me about the reward - there was some discourse among them at the castle in King-street about the reward the City gave . Marcrost . At Mr . Foot 's house at Clerkenwell-green , Forsar desired to be admitted among us to take part of the rewards , and we refused to admit him as being a wicked man . He said if we would not admit him , he could make better of it him self , - we have agreed to exclude him from all the rewards . Q . Had you any money for any of the rewards ? Forsar . I have had ( I think ) five pounds , nine shillings [ this was part of the Government 's reward on the conviction of Ann Duck and Ann Barefoot . ] Mary Fisher . On the behalf of the prisoner said , she never knew any ill of her , and that she was publickly about her business , buying of old cloaths in Monmouth-street a little before last Lord Mayor 's day . Elizabeth Sampson . I keep a Sale-shop in Monmouth-street ; I have known her a year and an half , and have dealt with her : I saw her in her business about two or three days before she was taken up . Elizabeth Ball . I am a parish nurse ; I live in Chick lane ; I have known her between two and three years , and never saw any thing amiss of her . Jane Ball . I live in Hockley-in-the-hole ; my husband is a Journeyman butcher ; the prisoner is an honest industrious body , she comes often to my house ; her mother lives with me , and is a very honest woman . Sarah Hinchliffe . I live in St. Martin's-court in St. Martin's-lane , and keep a Fishmonger 's shop ; I have known her four years , she is an honest painstaking woman ; when she was taken up I went to see her at the Castle by Guild-hall , and Forsar took hold of me , and said , your name is Phillis , you are one of those that beat and abused me , and was going to take me into custody . Dorothy Smith and Mary Whitehead , ( dealers in old cloaths ) gave her the character of an industrious woman . Elizabeth Jones . I was servant to Mr. Forfar , and was there when Mr. Blewmire and Mr. Montgomery came in to call him out ; he was in bed , and got up , - he had a handkerchief about his neck when he went out , for I held the candle to him while he tied it on . William Buckland . I live in the prisoner 's neighbourhood ; I have known her fourteen or fifteen years , - she had the general character of keeping a very bad house , and harboured thieves ; I have heard Murder cried out there . Thomas Reynolds . ( Carpenter ) I have a piece of ground in Black-boy-alley : I always passed and repassed very quietly ; the prisoner never interrupted me , - her character ( to be sure ) is very bad , but I have not heard Murder cried out in her house , as I have in some others , but there were always a great many bad people there . William Dakins . - The Prisoner 's character is very bad ; she kept such a disorderly house , that Mr. Buckland went away upon her account . Mr. Perkins being called upon by Mr. Forfar , said , he has known Mr. Forfar seven or eight years , and never heard any thing amiss of him ; believes him to be a man of veracity and truth , and that he would not assert any thing upon oath that is false upon any account whatsoever . - Jackson . Mr. Forfar impressed me in my own house the 16th day of June at noon - I believe he was drunk ; he said he was a lieutenant , and I should go along with him . Prisoner . I do allow I have been guilty of folly , and have been very bad , but I have not done any thing of that kind lately ; and 't is hard I should be punished now for what I did formerly . Mr. Forfar subpoena 'd Mr. Pope to give me a bad character , I desire he may be called . Richard Pope . I know both the Prisoner and the Prosecutor ; I never heard any harm of either of them : I keep two houses , one in Black-boy-alley , and the Spaw by Black Mary's-hole . Q . What house do you keep in Black-boy-alley ? Pope . An honest house - my wife lives there - I am a bricklayer , and repair the whole estate - I have heard noises and disturbances in the Prisoner 's house formerly , but I have heard nothing of that kind these two years . Acquitted . 107 . + Ann Hedley , of St. Mary , Whitechapel , was indicted for assaulting Mary Cliff , in a certain alley , or open place , near the King 's highway , putting her in fear , and taking from her a pair of stays , value 6 s. a cambrick cap , value 6 d. a cambrick handkerchief , value 12 d. and an apron , value 6 d. the goods of Mary Cliff , Nov. 12 . Mary Cliff . I am almost sixteen years of age ; I live with Mr. Lud , a bricklayer , by Oxford Market ; the Prisoner is a chairwoman 's daughter just by , [ she is about seventeen years old ] I went to see her , and she said , Polly , will you go with me to see my cousins ; there are three young misses , and they want three young girls to wait upon them ; and you shall ride in a coach every day , and have every thing you want ? So Betty Brotherton and I went with her . She took us into Rag-fair . I asked where her cousins lived . She said , they are gone to h - ll , to cry brooms . She took me up an alley , and said , D - n you , you b - h , pull your stays off . I wo n't want while there 's any thing to make money of . And because they did not come off easily , she broke the lace . She said , if I cried out , she would run her fist down my throat . And she sold my stays for three shillings and six-pence - I had not a farthing of the money . The other girl [ Brotherton ] had five shillings of what she sold her things for . The Prisoner took me to a two-penny lodging in Church-alley by Ragfair ; we had bread and butter and strong beer for supper , and I staid with her all night , and sat upon the bed crying , and she said , D - n you , you sniveling b - h , come to bed . The next day we went to Oxford Market , and I was afraid of going home for fear of being beat . She wanted us to go to Mary-le-bon bason , and said , if she had got us there , we should not have told who hurt us . - She sold the stays and things in Rag-fair , and she would not let us go into the shop . She said , D - n you , stay out - We were afraid to cry out , that she had robbed us - I never went out with her . before . We met Mr. Ankers as we were going home ; and when she saw him , she said , G - d d - n you , we are all caught . I said , Mr. Ankers what shall I do . And he said , I should go to Mrs. Brotherton 's , and she should beg for me . Prisoner . We had tea and bread and butter for breakfast , and she came to me in the morning when I was in bed , and said she would go to the Buoy in the Nore to see her brother . Betty Brotherton said she was sick , and must pull her stays off . I said I would not pull mine off , but she pulled hers off , and sold them , and we had wine and strong beer at supper . Cliff . I had no wine , nor Betty Brotherton neither . Prisoner . We had two bottles of wine . What made you sick ? Cliff . I was not sick at all . The Prisoner said to Betty Brotherton , D - n you , if you do n't sell your ear-rings , I will get a Constable , and send you home to your mother , and have you well slogged . Elizabeth Brotherton . I am coming into my 13th year ; Cliff and I were going out , and the Prisoner would have us go with her to her cousins , who , she said , kept their coach : and she said , D - n you , it does not signify talking , for you shall go . When she went she could not find her cousins . I asked her where they were . She said , Oh d - n them , they are gone to h - ll to sell brooms . She took me up a passage , and said , I must strip ; and before I could get my stays off , she tore them open . - I was not sick then , I was sick afterwards at a house she carried me to . Then she took my gold bobs - she had the money for them : she said , she had sold my stays for a shilling . What , in the name of G - d , said I , did you sell my stays ? She said , I must have more than your stays ; I must have your ear-rings . She hit me a blow on the stomach , and said , she would send me to h - ll : and she said , If you do n't let me have them , I 'll get a porter , and send you where you shall never be heard of - I had no wine ; the Prisoner had wine , and a rabbit , a French cook frigafeed it - I did not taste it , I had nothing but a bit of bread and butter . I sat crying , and she called me , Snivelling b - h. There was a long bottle brought with white wine , and another with red ; she sat by herself , and we sat behind the door . Q . Did not she tell you , if you sold your things , she would acquaint your mother with it ? Brotherton . No , indeed ; she was going to kill us once , and there came a hog along , she thought it was a man coming , and she run away . Q . Had not you the money the things were sold for ? Brotherton . She gave me a crown , and said , here d - n you , take this , and put it into your pocket , and do n't look like a fool ; said I , what shall I do for my stays ? She took 3 s. from me again , then I had a groat left and she took that away from me at last - we took the prisoner the next day but one at her mother 's . Mr. Ankers . I live in the house with Elizabeth Brotherton ( the friends of the two girls had been under some uneasiness about them . ) Just by Great Marlborough-street there did I meet these three creatures draggled in mud . and in a miserable condition ; the prisoner made off , and said , by G - d the fault shall not all lye upon me , they shall have part as well as myself ; she had her cloaths on as she had when she went out , but the others were stripped - they had their caps on . Prisoner . That man knows nothing of it , there 's nobody knows any thing of it but the two girls and I . A person who happened accidentally to be in court , said he saw the two girls [ Cliff and Brotherton ] without Aldgate as drunk as they could be , rolling and tumbling in the channel .

John Harman , and Mary Shave , of St. Bartholomew the Less , were indicted for stealing a black ruffel quilted petticoat , value 40 s. a velvet cloak , value 30 s. 14 yards of ducape , value 3 l. 22 yards of persian , value 22 s. and other mercery goods , amounting in the whole to about 20 l. the goods of John Parks , and Benjamin Finch , September 15 . Benjamin Finch . The prisoners were both my servant s in the house , Harman was as a porter . On the 25th of October I sent him with three bills to the value of two hundred pounds . He not coming home that night made me very uneasy , and I was advised to advertise him , that if he had met with any misfortune , things should be made easy ; but he sent me sixty pounds between nine and ten that night in cash , and a letter that he would come to me the next day ; upon that I did not advertise him ; but he did not come according to his letter . The next day he sent me a letter to meet him the day following at Mr. Green 's , and he would inform me of his misfortune : and then he told me he had the misfortune between the bank and my house of having his pocket picked . I took him home to my house , and pressed him as much as possible to know what he had done with the money , but he denied he knew any thing of it . In about half an hour a person came and acquainted me that my man had been trading on his own account , and that he had a cloak made by Mrs. Morris . We kept him from 6 o'clock till 11 , and he still kept in the same story , that he did not know any thing of the money . Then he desired to speak with my partner , and he said he would confess every thing , and he confessed where he had lodged the money , and we found part of it ; and he owned that there was a box of goods of mine at Mrs. Long 's by Oxford Market . I was there and saw several remnants of my goods ; Harman confessed the taking them out of my house , and that Mary Shave was with him at the same time ; she had left my service then . I believe the man was as honest a fellow as ever was when he came into my house , but I believe she induced him to do this : there was a courtship between them . John Parks . On the Saturday that he surrendered himself to my partner at Mr. Green 's , he confessed where part of the money was , and we told it to sixty pounds and a guinea , and he said there was a long box ( and gave an account of some of the particulars ) with my goods in it , which was carried to Mrs. Long 's , in Oxford market , which he had lodged there a day or two before , and owned that the goods were carried from my house by him and Mary Shave ; and that the rest of the money was in that box . I and some others went with him in a coach , and there was taken out of the box 72 l. in money , and several parcels of goods which were worth about ten pounds . Mary Shave had left my place about six weeks before , and I heard she was gone to Colchester , there was a quilted petticoat and 16 yards of ducape found in her possession : I took out a warrant and pursued her to Colchester , and found several things upon her , and he confessed he took several things , which he said she had . He said they were sent by him to her . She had told me before there was an intended marriage ; she was advised to confess what she had defrauded me of , and she said there was a nine breadth quilted russel coat , and a seven breadth ditto , and she confessed some things that I had an account of , and some that I had not - she did not own she took any thing of mine , but said they were mine , and that she bought them of Harman . Mr. Richard Green . [ A gentleman who recommended Harman to Messieurs Parks and Finch ] confirmed the preceeding evidence relating to Harman 's acknowledging the fact . Mr. Story . Confirmed the finding of the afore mentioned box with the prosecutors goods , and that Mr. Finch and he brought another box afterterwards with some velvets , & c. from Oxford Market . Elizabeth Musgrove . About two months ago I was in Mr . Parks 's and Finch 's shop , and saw Mary Shave go behind the counter where the silks were , take a piece off-the shelf , and go down into the kitchen with it . - I believe there might be about twenty or twenty five yards of it , - I believe this is the piece , - it was a green silk with a pink colour and white selvidge ; I did not think she took it with any ill design , till this accident came out , and then I told my master of it . Parks . This was taken out of the box that was found at Oxford Market . Sarah Stoddard . I am a Mantua-maker ; I made a blue ducape for Mary Shave ; I believe this is the gown I made for her , but I ca n't swear to it . Parks . I have compar 'd this gown with a ducape waistcoat that Shave said was Harman 's , and I have compared it with two remnants of my goods , which were found in Oxford Market , and it is the same . Alice Moody , Mary Glenn , Elizabeth Beech , John Shave , Job Maddocks , Mary Linsley , Mrs. Slater , and Mr. Hevingham , have known Mary Shave , some twelve years , some ten years , and others three of four years , and gave her the character of a sober , honest , industrious person , and that they had never heard of any thing amiss being laid to her charge before .
