That his Suspicion belong confirm 'd by Mrs. Hatchet , who had seen the Person who stole the Goods , and knew him to be a Man very different in Person from Charles Motherby , he talk 'd sharply to him , threatning him , that if he did not confess the Truth he should be sent to Newgate .

Other Evidences depos 'd . That Charles Motherby was a Lodger in the House of John Dawes , the Sawyer , who was the Person said to have stolen the Goods , and that Edward Wootton was Brother to the Wife of the said John Dawes . The Prisoners Defence consisted chiefly in Three Things . First , In supporting their Reputation . Secondly , in charging the Prosecutor with a Design of extorting Money from them . And thirdly , In endeavouring to show that they had conform 'd themselves to the Statute in that Case made and provided . Wootton and Beal call 'd a great many , who gave them a good Character , both as to their Industry in their Callings , Wootton being a Frame-maker , and Beal a Carver ; and Motherby also call 'd 3 or 4 who gave him a good Character . And to prove the Prosecutor would have extorted Money from them , they call 'd Robert Ward , Thomas Ward , and a Brother of Wootton 's , who depos 'd , That Mrs. Hatchet would have compounded the Matter for 15 l. But their Evidence being attended with some seeming Improbabilities , and being deny 'd by the Prosecutor , it gain 'd but little Credit . The Third Part of their Defence related chiefly to Wootton , Beal , and Hornby , who seem 'd to infer , That they had comply 'd with the Statute , in that they had apprehended Charles Motherby , whom they said they took to be the Thief , and was all the Thief they knew ; urging that they had been at a great Expence in apprehending and fetching him 60 or 70 Miles out of the Country .
