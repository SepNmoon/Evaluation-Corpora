Thomas Bean , George Pruchase , Richard Price and William Price , ( who were all since Convicted and Executed for the same Fact , ) and with diverse other Persons to the Number of One Hundred and upward , in disturbance of the the Publick Peace , and for feloniouslly beginning to pull down and to demolish the Dwelling-house of Robert Read , contrary to the Form of the Statute , & c. John Boyle depos 'd , That he lodged at Mr. Read 's Mug-house for some Time past ; and being asked to give account what their Demeanor usually was when the Company which used the House met together , he answered , That he never knew the Society give any Provocation or Affront to any Person , except that once they turned a Man out of the House for hissing at the Duke of Marlborough 's Health : And being asked , whether they ever drank Confusion to any Persons , or to any Sort or Order of Men ; he answer 'd That he never heard any Confusion drank but once , and that since the last Sessions , they drank Confusion to the Ottoman Attempts against Prince Eugene and the Empire , or to that Effect . He further depos 'd , That the Friday-Night before the Day mentioned in the Indictment , a Mob gathered about the Mug-house , whereupon some Gentlemen sent to a Mug-house in Tavistock-Street to some of their Friends , who immediately came and disperst the Mob ; so that no Harm was done that Night , only a few Panes of Grass were broke . That upon Monday the 23d of July , in the Evening , a Mob began to gather in the Street when the Society was assembled ; that one Overs , a Constable , came to the Door with some Watchmen , and drew up in a Rink before the Door , and then the Mob began to increase very fast , and hiss 'd the Gentlemen as they went in and out ; whereupon the Witness went out and ask 'd them what they hiss 'd at , but they threw Stones at him and at the Windows . That some Time after one Johnson , another Constable , came with more Watchmen , but they did not endeavour to disperse the Mob , but encouraged them , and they continued to throw Stones at the House whilst the Constables stood by . That he being in the Coffee-Room , a Stone was thrown out of the Street into the Room , which hit him upon the Leg ; whereupon he went out to the Constables , and told them , he wondred they would suffer Stones to be thrown into the House by the Mob when they had Power enough to disperse them ; but they answer 'd , that the People in the House threw the Stones from above and broke their own Windows ; which was impossible for them to do , for the Window shutters above were fast shut , so that no Stone could be thrown out . That Mrs. Read offer 'd the Watchmen a Quart of strong Ale to drink the King 's Health , but the Constables would not suffer them . That Mr. Hucks offered them a Crown to drink the Kings 's Health , but the Constables refused it ; and he having given it to one of the Watchmen , the Constable made him return it . That all this while the Mob continued throwing Stones at the House and Windows , so that was scarce a whole Pane left below Stairs ; whereupon one Badcock , a Constable , who was in the House , went out and read the Proclamation , and the Mob all the while hiss 'd at him . That very soon after the Proclamation was read the Constables and Watchmen went away , and the Mob went away at the same time : And being ask 'd what made the Mob go away with the Constables and Watch ; he said , he believ 'd they did not care to stay after the Constables were gone , for that they were more afraid of the Gentlemen in the House than of the Constables . That the next Morning about Six a Clock the mob began to gather again , and threw Stones at the Windows ; upon which he went out to persuade them to be quiet and to do no more Mischief , but he received two Blows on his Head by Stones , one of which gave him a great Swelling in his Forehead , and the other cut him on the side of his Head , and made him bleed very much . That thereupon he went into the house and brought out a Stick and drove them a little way , but struck no body but the Man who hit him with the Stone . That afterwards the Mob encreasing , and a great Number being come from Fleetstreet arm 'd with Sticks , the Witness , together with Mr. Read and a Grenadier , and some others , went out and drove the Mob to Fleet-street , but being over power 'd they were forced to retire again ; upon which the Mob advanced in great Numbers , with Daniel Vaughan at their Head , crying Down with the Mug-house . That Mr. Read and the Grenadier presented their Pieces 3 or 4 Minutes , and bid them stand off and have a care ; but they pressing on , Mr. Read and the Grenadier fir 'd , and Vaughan fell . That the Mob coming on still with great Fury , the Witness and another Man consulted together to make a Barricade upon the Stairs , by which Means the upper part of the House was preserved till such time as the Mob were disperst by the Guards : But that below Stairs the Windows and sashes were all broke to pieces , the Bar and the Cupboard , and the Post to which the Coffee-Mill was fixt , were broke down , and also the Benches and Wainscoat , and it look 'd just like a House that was pulling down ; and all the Goods were broke to pieces and destroy 'd . Thomas Arrowsmith deposed , That he was at the Mug-house upon Monday in the Evening ; That about 8 or 9 ' a-Clock the Mob insulted the Gentlemen as they came in and out , hisshing and throwing Stones at them . That a Constable and some Watchmen came to the House , and afterwards another Constable and Watchman , but they fir 'd rathet to encrease the Mob ; upon which he went out and bid the Mob be quiet and go away , or it should be worse for them . But the Constable took their part , and said the Windows were broke by the People in the House , and bid the Witness go away from the Door ; and said the House ought to be pull 'd down to the Ground . That the next Morning the Mob gathered again , and threw Dirt and Stones at the Windows ; and a Woman came up with two Brickbats and broke the Windows with one of them ; upon which he bid her be gone ; but she threw another , crying out High Church and Ormond , Damn all the Hanoverians , Down with the Presbyterians . That thereupon he took hold of her , and was bringing her into the House ; but one Delander a Watchmaker made several Strokes at the Witness , and he was knock 'd down by some among the Mob ; and the Woman was rescu 'd from him . That he getting up again pursued Delander towards the Water-side , and took him , and brought him into the Mug-house ; but the Mob increasing , and he having told his Name and where he liv 'd , was let go . That afterwards the Witness , Mr.Read , and some others , drove the Mob back to Fleet-street ; but being over powered , they were forced to retreat , and the Mob prest upon-them crying out High Church and Ormond , Down with the Mug-house . That Mr. Freebody a Constable read the Proclamation ; but that serving only to enrage the Mob . Mr. Read and the Witness fired their Pieces , after they had bid them stand off and have a care . That he then retired into the House , and defended it till some People had got in at the back Windows and thrust the Witness into the Street . That then , they knock 'd him down , drag 'd him along the Chanel , and beat him , and the Women struck him over the Head with their Pattens till they cut him to the Skull ; and he believed he had been murdered but by the Assistance of Mr. Cheesbrook the Clerk of the Artillery Company , who took him to the Castle Tavern , and had his Wounds drest . That when he came out again the two Constables who had been there the Night before seized him and carried him to another House , and told him they would have the satisfaction to see him Hang 'd ; but he told them he had the satisfaction to know he should not be Hang 'd that Day . That he was carried to Mr. Read 's House again that Afternoon , and found the Windows broke and the inside pull 'd to pieces . Mr. John Collins deposed , That he was at Mr. Read 's House on Monday Evening , and gave the like Account as the other Witnesses of the Proceedings that Night ; that he and some others staid in the House all Night , at Mrs. Read 's desire , for the Defence of the House : That the next Morning the Mob gathered again about Seven or Eight a Clock . That a Woman came by , Crying , Damn all the Presbyterians , and broke the Windows with Brick-bats : That he and the Grenadier took hold of her , but , Delander rescued her from them , and imediately made off towards the Waterside : That the Witness and the Grenadier pursuing him seized him ; that he begg 'd not to be exposed , for that it would be his utter Ruin ; but they brought him back to the Mug-House , where he was kept some time , and afterwards was let go : That the Mob growing very strong the Proclamation was read by a Constable , and the People in the Mug-House , huzza 'd , King George for ever ; But the Mob advanced , crying , High-church and Ormond , No King George , No Hanoverians ; Down with the Mug-House , throwing Stones and Sticks at the House , and breaking the Windows to pieces . That he heard Vaughan ( who was afterwards killed ) cry fall on brave Boys , the Duke of Ormond is landed in the West , with 20000 . Men , others said the Duke of Berwick and others the Lord Tinmouth : That after Mr. Read had fired , the Witness and some others went up Stairs , and made a Barricade , which probably prevented their being all killed ; that after he was up Stairs ; he heard great clattering and breaking of the Wainscot and Goods : That he saw the Prisoner , who had a Black Patch upon his Nose , in the House Five or Six Minutes , very busy , breaking the Sashes and Frames of the Windows ; that he had an instrument like a Butcher 's Cleaver with which he was cutting one of the Side Posts of the Door , and that the Prisoner joined all the while in the aforesaid Cries . Mr. James Harbottle Deposed That he was that Morning at Holbourn-Bridge , and saw a Mob passing along with Sticks upon their Shoulders who said they were going to pull down the Mug-House . Upon which he follow 'd them , and saw Sticks delivered to them from Mr. Nichols 's a Soapboilers , by Holbourn-Bridge ; That from thence they went down Shoe-Lane , and at a Brasier 's in Shoe-Lane , more Sticks were delivered them . That when they came to an Alley by Adam 's the Cook 's in Shoe-Lane , they distributed the Sticks ; and he heard them say , come Boys , here are Sticks enough : That thereupon he went to the Mug-House , and acquainted them with what he had seen ; upon which the Proclamation was read , but they prest forwards , and were afterwards beat back again by the Grenadier ; but they growing stronger beat back the Grenadier , and the others who were in defence of the House , throwing Stones and Sticks in great numbers at them and at the House . Mr. Robins depos 'd That on Monday Night he saw a great Crowd of People at the Mug-house Door , who hiss 'd at and abused every Body that went in or out of the House . That the next Morning he went to the Mug-house , but knew no body there ; however he durst not venture out immediately for fear of the Stones that were flung by the Mob . At last , he and a Gentleman that was with him having an Opportunity , came out , and went to the Castle Tavern in Fleetstreet . That about 12 a Clock he went again to the Mug-house , and a Gentleman brought a Blunderbuss in a Coach , and told the People in the House , that a prodigious Mob was coming down Shoe-lane . That a great Mob appeared immediately , and the Witness went to the Corner of the Square , and staid there till the Piece went off . That he saw the Windows of the Mug-house broke to Pieces . That the Mob threw Ropes over the Sign-Irons , and pulled with such Violence in order to pull down the Sign , that he was afraid the Front of the House would come down and do a great deal of Mischief , and thereupon he went away . That he saw a Parcel of Sticks deliver 'd to the Mob out of a Druggist 's House at the Corner of Salisbury Court in Fleetstreet , and afterwards he saw several single Sticks delivered to them out of the Shop Window . Mr. Michael Burrel depos 'd , That on Monday Night he going by the End of Salisbury-Court in Fleetstreet , saw a great Mob in the Court , and was told they were going to pull down the Mug-house ; and going up to the House , he saw two Constables and several Watchmen in the Street before the House , who encouraged the Mob , for that he was sure they were able to have dispers 'd them , if they had a Mind to it . That Stones were brought in Baskets to the Mob , some of 7 or 8 Pound Weight , and laid down just by the Constables and Watchmen who suffered the Mob to throw them at the House . That when the Constables and Watchmen went off the Mob presently after run away , apprehending ( as he believed ) more Danger from the Gentlemen in the House whom they had abused , than from the Constables . That the next Morning he went there again , he saw a great Mob breaking the Windows and Goods of the House to pieces ; and heard them say , Just thus will we pull King George from his Crown , which is none of his own . Mr. Rich Bennet mention 'd many of the Particulars of the Riot , both on Monday Night and Tuesday Morning , to the same Effect with the former Witnesses . That after the Mob had beat the Grenadier and the others with him back to the Mug house , he saw a Man bring out two Bottles and carry 'd them over against the Swan Ale house , where he and several others drank the Pretender 's Health by the Name of King James the Third , and were answered with Huzza 's by the People at the Swan Windows . Mr. Carleton Smith deposed , That he was sent by my Lord Mayor to Salisbury-Court on the Tuesday Morning , to see what was doing there . That when he came there , he found the Crowd so great that he could not get in at the End of the Court in Fleetstreet ; so he went thro ' St . Brides Passage , and saw two Parties engaging and Daniel Vaughan deceased at the Head of the Mob . That as the Witness was getting into the said St . Brides Passage to save himself , Vaughan was shot ; and fell just by him . That presently he heard a great Noise , and rashing of Boards breaking in the House . And then he thought high time to go and inform my Lord Mayor what was doing . That the Prisoner was brought before my Lord Mayor that Day , and committed by his Lordship . And that the Prisoner had then a Patch upon his Nose . Mr. Badcock depos 'd , That being informed on Monday Night , that there was a Design to pull down the Mug-house , and being a Constable , he was desired to go thither to keep the Peace , which he accordingly did . That he found a great Mob about the House , and a Constable and some Watchmen before the Door . That the Mob stung Stones at the House , whereupon he went out to the Constable , and desired him to keep the Peace and to disperse the Mob ; but he answered , that there was no Disturbance but what was made by the People in the House , and that his Hour ( 10 a Clock ) was not come . That the Mob continuing to throw Stones , he went out again , and found Johnson ( another Constable ) there , and about 20 Watchmen . And the Witness told him , he wondred he would suffer the People to throw Stones so , and to insult the House ; acquainting him that he himself was a Constable , and offering to assist him in dispersing the Mob . But Johnson answer 'd him , that he ( the Witness ) was no Constable of the Night , nor of that Ward , and had nothing to do there , and that there were no Stones thrown but what were thrown out of the House , which was impossible , for the Shutters were fast shut , so that nothing could be thrown out at the Windows . And then one of the Watchmen took hold of the Witness , and would have pulled him out of the House . That afterwards he went up Stairs , and often came to the Stair-head to hearken whether the Noise encreased or not . And after some time finding it very great , he came down , and ventured into the Street , and read the Proclamation ; and during the time he was reading it , the Mob threw Stones and Dirt so thick , that he was forced to turn his Back to them for fear of receiving Mischief from them . That presently after reading the Proclamation , the Constables , and Watchmen , and the Mob went away almost at the same time . Samuel Gott deposed , That he saw the Prisoner there ; That he took particular Notice of him , and that he had a great black square Patch upon his Nose ; That the Prisoner had a Stick in his Hand , with which he broke the Glass and Sashes or Frames of the Windows ; and that he was very active and violent in what he did . That there being a Report that the Guards were coming , the Prisoner made off towards Water-lane ; but it proving false , he returned , and fell to work again with the same Fury as before . Thomas Bone depos 'd , That he saw the Prisoner with a Stick in his Hand , very active among the Mob , and breaking the Goods that were thrown into the Street . Richard Newell deposed , That he saw the Prisoner among the Mob on the Monday Morning ; That he had a black Patch upon his Nose ; That after the Proclamation was read , he saw the Prisoner advance towards the Mug-house with a Stick in his Hand . That he saw him afterwards chopping the Frame of the Window with something like a Butcher 's Cleaver . That during all the time of the Mob , the general Cry among them was , High Church and Ormond , No Hannoverians , No King George , Down with the Mug-house . The Prisoner in his Defence said , he did not join with the Mob , but was coming through the Court accidentally in his Way from Dinner out of Shoe-Lane to his Place of Work ; and denied his being in Read 's House : Then he called abundance of Witnesses , who were all heard , The First swore he gave the Prisoner the Blow on the Face which occasioned the Patch . The Second , that he put the Patch upon his Nose . The Third , that he dined at her House in Shoe-Lane with the Patch upon his Nose ; and went away about One a-Clock . The other Witnesses gave an Account that they had known the Prisoner , some from his Birth , and others when he was a Child , and others when he was an Apprentice , that he had then behav 'd himself well , but none of them gave any Account of the Character for Three or Four Years past . But nothing of all this Evidence serving to clear him of the Fact ; but rather to confirm the Evidence against him on the part of the King ; the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment . [ Death . See summary . ] James Beaver , William Eldridge , Hester Stibbs , Eleanor Hornsby , and Anne Lane , were indicted for a Riot , in assembling themselves with diverse other Persons in a Riotous Manner under a Pretence of celebrating in a publick and insulting Manner the Death of Thomas Bean , a Malefactor convicted last Sessions for Felony , on the Statute of the First of the King , and executed for the same ; and in open Contempt of the Government and the Laws of the Land ; on the 30th of September last . Mr. Carleton Smith depos 'd , That the Friday before the Lord Mayor having Information that a Procession was intended to be made the next Sunday , by a Number of Persons who were to be drest with White Hoods and Favours , and to walk in that Manner thro ' the principal Streets of London , his Lordship gave him Orders to enquire diligently into it , and endeavour to find out where they who compos 'd it were assembled ; and about Nine a Clock that Morning he saw a great Crowd of People ( near a Thousand ) in Salisbury Court , and thereupon he went back to acquaint the Train 'd Bands of it , who were posted at Bridewell ; thereupon they went up to the Multitude and bid them disperse ; which signifying but little , they drove them away by Force . That in the Afternoon he went in Search of them again , up and down , where he imagined they were ; and about Three a Clock saw a very great Concourse of People at the farther End of Water-lane ; but did not think proper to go too near them , being alone , lest he should be discover 'd , and inform 'd himself of their Motions by another Observer : Then he went to the Captain of the Train 'd Bands , who sent a Detachment to disperse them ; but when they came they were gone to Black Fryars ; upon which they follow 'd them and saw them upon the Water in two Boats ; and they took that in which were the Prisoners ; the other had put off some Time before , and got away . That he would have had the Train 'd Bands level their Pieces to make that Boat bring to ; but they did not think fit to do so . That Beaver jump 'd out of the Boat into the Water to make his Escape ; but was retaken . The Men had White Gloves and Favours ; and some of the Women White Favours , White Sarsenet-Hoods , and White Gloves ; others had no Favours . That all the Prisoners were then carried before the Lord Mayor , and said upon Examination , they were going to St. George 's Church . Mr. John Hill depos 'd , that being with the Captain of the Train 'd Bands that Afternoon , Mr. Smith came to them , and said there was a great Multitude of People in a Procession in Water-Lane ; upon which a Detachment was order 'd out ; and he went after the Prisoners to observe their Motions , and saw them take a Boat at Black-Fryars-Stairs ; but that not being sufficient for them all , and no other being ready , he hastned to the Officer of the Train 'd Bands , and told him , he might overtake some of them before they could get off , who therefore march 'd with all Expedition , and came up with the Prisoners just as they had put off ; upon which he jumpt into the Water , and caught hold of the Boat-rope and haul 'd it ashore . That there were three others with them dress 'd after the same Manner who the Lord Mayor discharg 'd , it appearing they had not been at Bean 's Funeral with the rest , but were invited and allur 'd into this Procession by them . Lieutenant Blackwell swore , That on the Day aforesaid he march 'd under Captain Kelson in the Train 'd Bands ; who having Notice of the Design of the Prisoners and the rest to make a Procession , as had been mention 'd , commanded him to march with the greatest Expedition , and overtake them ; but coming to Water-Lane , he receiv 'd Information that they were gone , by the Mob . who hiss 'd at , and shov 'd his Men , hollowing for Joy of their Escape , and crying out , They are gone , They are gone . But Mr. Hill bringing him Advice , that he might still come up with some of them before another Boat could be ready to carry them off , he pursu 'd his March to Black-Fryars-Stairs , and there took the Prisoners . They all endeavour 'd to excuse themselves to him by saying , We have done no Harm ; Ca n't we go where we will with our own Favours , and such like . He further depos 'd , That he had receiv 'd Information that the Procession was to consist of 2 or 300 People dress 'd like these , who were to go in the Morning to St. Septebres Church , and take a Turn round by all the Mug-houses , and then to St . Brides Church yard where Bean was buried , to commemorate him : which being a most infamous Contrivance to disturb the Peace of the City , and his Majesty 's Government , and in open Defiance of the Laws of the Land , he thought it his Duty to give Notice of it to the Lord Mayor ; for which Service some of the Leaders of the Party had since arrested him in an Action of 50 l. Captain Kelson swore , That his Lieutenant Blackwell came to him , and informed him of the Procession a Day or 2 before , and it being his turn to march that Day , they went together to my Lord Mayor 's , to acquaint him with it and receive his Orders , upon which his Lordship bid him go to his Major for Orders to raise his company by 7 a Clock that Sunday Morning , those he already had being to meet at 4 in the Afternoon ; which he accordingly did and was upon Guard with his Company by 9 ; and some time after 2 Constables ( one of which was Johnson , who encourag 'd the Riot at the Mug house in Salisbury-Court ) came to him and ask 'd him why he suffer 'd such a Mob in the Streets , having a Power and Instructions sufficient to disperse them ; upon which he order 'd a Detachment to asist the Constables in the Performance of their Office ( according to his Lordshi'ps Directions ) and afterwards another with his Lieutenant to pursue the Prisoners . Mr. Robinson Swore , That being a Constable , he was desired by Lieutenant Blackwell the Saturday Night before , to accompany him to Salisbury-Court that Sunday Morning , which he did , and went with the Detachment to Black-Friars , where he was charg 'd with the Prisoners after they had been taken in the Manner before depos 'd ; who said they had done no Harm , but had chosen the By-Ways to prevent giving Offence . He also deposed , That there were some Hundreds of People through which they pass 'd , who were very rude , violent , and tumultuous . The two Men , Beaver and Eldridge , said in their Defence , they were intimately acquainted with the late Bean , and were invited to his Burial by his Mother , after which they agreed to go with the rest , who were also invited , to Church in their Favours , and other Funeral Ornaments , as was usual in such Cases ; and neither thought nor intended to give Offence ; and humbly hop 'd that the Court would consider their Youth and inexperience , and not punish that for a Crime which was never intended by them to be one . As to the Woman , they all said too , they were invited to the Burial , and Stibbs said she made an Excuse to go to see her Aunt , to her Master , when she went to it ; Lane said she was Bean 's Fellow Servant ; and Hornsby , that she liv 'd once in the same Court with him : And that they furnish 'd themselves with what Ornaments they had , and thought they had committed no Offence , nor done any thing but what was usual . And all of them own 'd , that what they had done , was in Respect to Bean 's Memory . One of the Men said there was but Seven or Eight Couple ; but the Evidence against him Swore , there was Twenty or Thirty ; upon which he replied , the rest did not belong to them , nor did he know them ; but thought they might belong to another Funeral , which happen 'd the same Evening in St . Brides Church-Yard . Then the Lord Parker summ 'd up the Evidence ; which the Jury Considering , brought the Prisoners in Guilty of the Indictment . [ Fine .

He , in Defence , said he had been drinking with a Ship-mate , who , being fuddled , threw his Hat upon the Leads , which put him upon the Necessity of climbing up to it , but being too heavy in the Head , he fell down ; but he could not prove this , and the Jury found him Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

There were several other Circumstances prov 'd of the Prisoner , and his Friends tampering with , threating and frightening the said Witness ; but being a Man of Honesty and good Character , to no Effect . The Prisoner said several Things in his Defence to take off the Force of the Proof , and call 'd some of his solliciting Creatures to vouch them , but to no Purpose ; neither he nor they having any Reputation to support what they said against the sound evidence which oppos 'd it , and the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment .

ADVERTISEMENTS . The most excellent BALSAMICK WATER , being the greatest Preservative of Health in Nature , that in 50 Years Study of Physick I could find out , needs not much to be said in its Commendation , for it will recommend it self ; and I have no other Interest in making of it Publick , but for the Satisfaction of my Friends , and the general Good of Mankind , and that it may not die with me , I do n't ( like the English Quack ) say that it cures all Distempers ; but it infallibly keeps the Body in good Health , and defends it from all infectious Airs and distempers , by taking 3 spoonfuls of it in half a Pint of warm Ale , a Glass of White Wine , Tea , or any other Liquid . It may be taken by all Persons , of what Age or Sex soever , at any time of the Day , without Confinement or Hinderance of Business , according to the printed Directions given with it . It prevents Consumptions , and cures them if not too far gone ; it relieves the Tissick and Shortness of Breath ; cures Ulcers in the Lungs , or in any part of the Body ; it opens all Obstructions , and infallibly destroys all sorts of Worms in Young or Old . It cures the Yellow and Black Jaundice , Leprosy , Itch , and Scald Heads . It certainly eradicates that reigning Distemper the Scurvey ; chears the Spirits , strengthens the Stomach , and creates a good Appetite . I recommend it to all Child-bearing Women , it preserving the Infant from those Infirmities that Children are generally afflicted with , purifies the whole Mass of Blood , renders the Skin beautiful and clear , and causes easy Delivery . Likewise I recommend it to Sea-faring Men that Trade to the East or West Indies , or those Countries where Fevers or the Plague are infectious . When all other Remedies fail , this excellent Balsamick Water drives out the small Pox or Measles , and keeps them from the Stomach or Throat , preventing that Soreness which generally accompanies , and often proves fatal to that Distemper ; and also prevents the Small Pox or any other infectious Distemper , from spreading in a Family . It 's excellent for Gentlemen after hard Drinking , far exceeding any thing ; it discharges the Body from the Impurity of bad Wine , and cleanses it from all Scorbutick Sports , Scabs , or Boyls , by bathing outwardly ; and cures all Old Sores and Green Wounds , by washing the Place with it ; and all sorts of sore Mouths caused by inward Heat or Canker . It is also excellent for all Persons that drink the Waters , causing them to pass and evacuate whatever Humours offend the Body . This excellent Balsamick Water is put up in half Pint Bottles , at 2 s.6 d. each Bottle , with Directions at large for the Taking and Use of it , which being close stopp 'd retains its Virtue in all Climates ; for the older it grows , the better it is : It generally gives one Stool , and works off by Urine . This excellent Balsamick Water is made by none but my self ; and , to prevent Counterfeits , is fold only at Mr. Parker 's Books-seller , at the Bible and Crown in Lombard Street , near Stocks-Market , sealed with a Lion and Dagger . Perform 'd by HENDRICK VANDOR We Thomas and Elizabeth Griffiths , who keep the great o 'd publick News-shop over against the Blue posts and Rummer Eating-house at Charing-Cross , do hereby testify , that by only putting about our Child 's Neck at three Months old , the celebrated Necklace recommended by Dr. Chamberlen for Childrens Teeth , it has now cut most of its Teeth , being near a Year old , and never has had any Fever , Convulsions , Pains , or such usual Illness and Uneasiness , which commonly attend Children in breeding and cutting their Teeth ; but has all this Time ( notwithstanding it has bred and cut so many Teeth ) so thriv 'd , and has all along been so healthy and well , that perhaps all England can not shew a finer Boy , as any Person that pleases may be fully satisfied of who will but give themselves the Trouble to come or send any to see the Child . Witness our Hands the 14th of August 1716. Tho Griffiths , Eliz Griffiths . This wonderful Necklace , pr.5 s. with printed Directions in English and French for wearing it , is only to be had up one Pair of Stairs at the Sugar-loaf a Confectioner 's Shop over against Old Round Court near the New Exchange in the Strand , and no where else . Where ( for the Satisfaction of the World as to the real Virtue of this Sovereign Necklace ) is given Gratis the Philosophical Essay , dedicated to Dr. Chamberlen and the Royal Society , upon this Necklace , occasioned by the great Increase of late Years in the Bills of Mortality , by which it appears , that in and about London only , above 12000 Children yearly die of their Teeth ; whereas out of the great Numbers of Children who in time have worn this Necklace , we do not know of so much as one that has died , but on the contrary , has bred and cut them without any Pain , and all the while thriv 'd extreamly . Note , At the same Place is also given Gratis in English and French , The 16th Edition , dedicated to Dr. Chamberlen , of the Practical Scheme of secret Injuries and broken Constitutions , by fast living , former ill Cures , Salivations , and Mercury . For the Good of the Publick . Whereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex , in this Kingdom , have contracted an evil Habit of Body , wherein the vicious Humours , at first dispers 'd thro the Whole , come at length to be lodg 'd in one Part or another , and many times , for Causes too long to be here mentioned , are thrown down upon the Womb , occasioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part , which being neglected , at last turns Cancerous , and often proves Fatal . I cure the Diabetes when given over by all other Persons . This is to acquaint all such as may have occasion , that a speedy Relief is to be had from an Experienc 'd Midwife , dwelling at the Sign of the Queen 's Arms , a Gold Smith 's Shop , near Exeter Exchange in the Strand , who perform 'd a Cure upon a Lady at the Bath , after she was given over by the Physicians , and since has Cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and Suburbs of London . I should not have put my self in Publick Print , but to satisfy the Afflicted where they may have speedy Relief after they are given over by all other Persons . At her House the Red Ball in Queen-street , Cheapside , near the Three Cranes , Liveth a Gentlewoman that hath a most incomparable Wash to beautifie the Face ; which far exceeds all that are extant , as abundance of the greatest Quality have found by Experience , to their great Satisfaction . It takes out all manner of Wrinkles , Freckles , pimples , Redness , Morphew , Sun-burn , Yellowness , caus 'd by Mercurial poisonous Washes : It also plumps and softens the Skin , making it as smooth and tender as a sucking Child 's : The Young it always keeps so , and the Old it makes appear Fair and Young to Admiration . It has nothing of Paint in it , neither doth any Person know the Secret . You may have from Half a Crown to Five Pounds the Bottle . You may have Pomatums , White pots , the like not to be compared with ; also a Powder for the Teeth , which makes them as white as snow . She hath a most excellent Secret to prevent Hair from falling , causing it to grow wherever it is wanting . She alters Red or Grey Hair to a delicate light or dark Brown in a few Days , which will never change . She shapes the Eye-brows , and makes them beautiful : She hath a delicate Paste to whiten the Hands , and a Red Pomatum to colour the Lips , and prevents their chopping in Winter . She has a certain and infallible Cure for the Toothach , without drawing , that the Pain will not return . Note , Remov 'd from the Cheshire-Cheese in Walbrook .
