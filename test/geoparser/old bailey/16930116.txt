To prove which , the Witnesses for the King were called and Sworn : The first of which deposed , That having Information that the Prisoner was an Ill Woman , a Warrant was obtained to search her House , under a pretence of her being a Clipper ; and when the Constable came there with his Assistants , they found the Prisoner up two pair of stairs ; and as they were searching in the Garret , in an old Trunk was found a great Number of the Declarations , about a Thousand or more besides other Pamphlets , entituled , The Dear Bargain ; Just Weights and Measures ; and another , called Hodge-Podge as before-mentioned : The Prisoner seemed very much surprized at their taking of the Papers ; and told the Searchers , That they came to look for Clipp 'd Money , and therefore what had they to do with Papers , & c. ? They seized the Pamphlets and the Declarations , as also the Prisoner , and carried her before a Magistrate , who committed her to Newgate for the Offence . There were several concurring Evidence to the Matter of Fact ; especially two , one of which declared , That she owned that she had the Papers from Westminster , brought to her by a Boy who she called Black or Jack ; but would not acknowledge who was the Author or Printer of the same ; and that she sate up all night to dry the Declarations , being newly brought from the Press ; and that she bundled them up , and carried them out in the Night in Coaches . Another Evidence swore , That the Prisoner had Confess 'd to her , That she had disposed of several of them amongst her Friends , ( but she lookt upon them to be no more than Waste Paper ) , and that the Papers were to be brought to her , and when she received them she promised the Witness that she should have one of them . The Prisoner called some Evidence , who said , That she was an ingenuous Woman , and behaved her self well in times past , in her general Conversation . After which , the Jury withdrew to Consider of the Evidence ; and after half an hours time they brought in a Verdict , That the Prisoner was Guilty of High-Treason . After which , she was Condemned to be Burnt for the same . Ambrose Holland after the Condemnation was past , was brought into Court to the Bar , but not charged upon the Jury upon Oath , but only to satisfie all people that he did on the 26th of May last , in Company of William Reynolds , and one Aldgood High-Way Men , stole a couple of Horses out of the Grounds near Tatnum Court , the Horses of Major Langstone : he would not plead to the Indictment , but Aldgood proved it upon him ; he said he was surpriz 'd for want of notice , but that was but a feign 'd Excuse ; He was ordered to be executed this Sessions . NOtwithstanding the great Indulgence that hath been shewed to several great and wicked Offenders , who have ( since the Corronation of our most Gracious King and Queen that now is ) been Committed to Newgate for their Enormous and Mischievous Faults ; yet how many are there ( that tho their Eyes are open ) do blind themselves , and will not see into the Abyss and Depth of that Misery wherein they involve themselves , by reason of their perverse and unreformable Lives ? But will still go on in the pursuit of their premeditated and base Designs , to the great Loss and Destruction ( not only ) of honest Mens Rights but to the utter Ruin ( many times ) of their own Souls and Bodies ; yet for all this , and on purpose to shew Mercy , and to extend Their Royal Favour and Bounty , the King and Queen did at the latter end of this Session , Grant a Pardon to those Persons whose Names follow , who all pleaded the same on their Knees in open Court .

Robert Scofield . John Overton . Joseph Mead . Richard Harris . Joanna Jones alias Margaret Moor . Thomas Tovey . Richard Page . Francis Thursfield . James Duncomb . John Child . John Aldgood . Elizabeth Lee . George Holmes . William Warrington . Abraham Welsh . Sarah Chandler . After they had all kneeled down , the Pardon was read , and the Convicts were all advised to take due warning by such and so great Clemency , that they did lead better Lives for the future , at which they seemed to be much affected some of them ; and then they were all remanded to the Goal . THe Grand Jury for the City of London , did this Sessions bring a Presentment into Court against several Abuses and Misdemeanors committed in the said City , to the Displeasure of Almighty God , and the Dishonour of the same . First , Against Ale-houses and Taverns , who suffer lewd and evil-disposed Persons , to fit Tipling and Drinking on the Lords Day . Secondly , Against all such who lay Unnecessary and Impertinent Wagers , there being several Offices kept about the Town to encourage Persons so to do . Thirdly , Against all Lotteries and Gaming-houses , especially against the Royal-Oak Lottery , it being of bad Consequence to the Youth , and Apprentices of the City . Fourthly , Against all Persons who entertain such Persons who pick up each other in the Streets . To this the Court was pleased to Answer , That they had made a very Grave and Sober Presentment ; and Order 'd that Processes should be made out against several particular Houses in and about the City , in order to the Suppression of all such Offenders ; it being of very evil Example , and of great Mischief to the Interest of all Men .
