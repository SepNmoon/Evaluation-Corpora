And While they were standing there ( for they would not go in , ) the Deceas 'd ( who was in the Kitchen ) came out to the Door , and desired the Prisoner to pay him the Guinea that he ow 'd him . The Prisoner call 'd him a Bear-Garden Fellow ; and said that he ow 'd him nothing . Then there was Swearing and Calling Names on both sides , and they all hussled together . Mr. Bourn closed , the Deceas 'd . and as the same time the Prisoner stab 'd the Decease 'd over Mr. Bourn 's Shoulder , and then flourish 'd his Sword , and cry 'd , Stand off . The Decease 'd had no Sword at that time , nor did I see him strike the Prisoner at all ; Mr. Bourn help 'd him into our House , and there he died presently . - I was indeed a little suddled , but I remember very well all that pass 'd . Mary Poplet thus depos 'd . The Deceas 'd was sitting by the Kitchen Fire when the Prisoner came to the Door . Mrs. Hains ( who is Mrs. Cook 's Sister ) heard his Tongue , and said , there 's Mr. Chandler at the Door . The Deceas 'd got up and said the owes me a Guinea , I 'll go and ask him for it . Pray do n't ( says Mrs. Cook ) - Dear Dick take another opportunity : He answered there 's no Time like the present , and so went out .

When the Prisoner came to the Door , the Deceas 'd was sitting by the Fire with a Knife in his Hand , but I am not sure whether he laid it down or not , When he ran to the Door . - I heard the Prisoner say , Stand off . - you 're a Bear-Garden Fellow , I do n't understand Boxing . The Deceas 'd call 'd him Scoundrel , and ill Words pass 'd on both sides .

The Wound was Mortal , it penetrated to the Cavity of the Breast near the left Pap , and went strait downward , and not at all obliquely . The Wound was all of a Breadth ; and therefore I think it could not be given over another Mans Shoulder : For in Such a Case the Wound would have been wider at the Orifice than it was inwards . Hasting and Mead depos 'd that they took the Prisoner the same Night in Long Acre betwixt 12 and 1 . That he made no Resistance and that when they brought him to the Deceas 'd , he said he was sorry for it . The Prisoner then made his Defence . Mr. Bourn thus depos 'd . The Deceas 'd demanded a Guinea . The Prisoner answer 'd , I owe you none . Then , says the Deceas 'd , I 'll have is out of your Bones ; and with that he struck at the Prisoner over my Shoulder , and kickt up my Heels ; in the Fall I broke the Skin off my Finger . Then , and not before , I saw the Prisoner with his Sword drawn : He retreated in a Posture of Defence , and said to the Deceas 'd , Keep off . Bear-Garden ! The Deceas 'd follow 'd him 5 or 6 Yards . The Prisoner still bade him keep off , and drew back as he spoke ; but the Deceas 'd continued to push forward , though I saw nothing in his Hand , and whether he ran upon the Prisoner 's Sword or not , I ca n't tell .

It appear 'd that about a 11 in the Morning , while the Prosecutor was absent , the Prisoner took a Bundle of Stockings out of his Shop in Kings-land Road , and that the Prisoner being afterwards apprehended , confest he took the Goods and sold 'em for 6 s. to Deborah Sanders , who sold Eggs in a Cellar in White-Chaple , and thot she encourag 'd him to steal any Thing that he could get , and she would buy it of him , she was likewise apprehended , but died in Newgate .

See summary . ] Thomas Billings and Thomas Woods , of St. Mary le bon , were indicted for the Murder of John Hays , the former by striking and bruising the said John Hays on the hinder Part of the Head with a Hatchet , on the 1st of March last , of which he instantly died , and the latter for being accessary to the said Murder . To which Indictment they both pleaded Guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] Katharine Hays , was indicted for Petty Treason , in being Traiterously present , comforting and maintaining the said Thomas Billings in the Murder of the said John Hays , her Husband . Richard Bromage thus depos 'd . After the Prisoner Katherine Hays was committed to Newgate , I and Robert Wilkins , and Leonard Myring went to visit her . - I am sorry , says , I , to see you here on this Account . And so am I too , says she , For God 's sake , says I , what cou 'd put it into your Head , to commit such a barbarous Murder upon your own husband ? Why says she , the Devil put it into my Head , but however John Hays was none of the best of the Husbands , for I have been half starved ever since I was married to him . I do n't in the least repent of any Thing that I have done , but only in drawing those two poor Man into this Misfortune . I was Six Weeks in importuning 'em to do it ; they deny 'd it 2 or 3 Times , but at last they agreed . My Husband was made so drunk that he fell out of his Chair , and then Billings ( who was a Taylor ) and Wood carried him into the back Room , and laid him upon the Bed . I was not in that Room , but in the Fore Room on the same Floor when he was kill 'd . But they told me that Billings struck him twice on the Head , with a Pole Ax , and then Wood cut his Throat . When he was dead I went in and held the Candle , while Wood cut his Head quite off , and afterwards they chop 'd off his legs and Arms . And why , says I , did you use your Husband in such an inhumane manner . Because , says she , we wanted to get him into an Old Chest , but he was too long , and too big . We thought to have done it with only cutting off his Head , and his Legs , but we were forced to cut off his Thighs and his Arms , and then the Chest would not hold 'em all . The Body and Limbs were put into Blankets , and carried out at several Times the next Night , and thrown into a Pond . But what , says I , could induce the Men to be guilty of all this ? Was it the sake of Money ? No , says she The Devil was in us all , and we were all got drunk . And what , says I , can you say for your self when you come before the Judge ? Why , says she , it will signify nothing to make a long Preamble , I 'll hold up my Hand and say that I am Guilty , for nothing can save me , nobody can forgive me . Robert Wilkins depos 'd to the same Effect . Leonard Myring thus depos 'd . I was with the Prisoner 2 or 3 Times before this ; one of those Times was I think on the Sunday after she was committed . - I am glad you 're come , says she , for the Men that did the Murder are taken . and have confess 'd it . I was not with 'em when they did it , for I was sitting upon a Stool by the Fire in the Shop , but I heard the Blow given , and heard somebody stamp . And why did not you cry out , says I , Because I was afraid they would kill me , says she : and after his Head was cut off it was put into a Pail , and Wood carry 'd it out ; Billing sat down by me ; and cry 'd , and would lye all the rest of the Night in the Room with the dead Body . But what , says I , was she first Occasion of your contriving to do this ? Why , says she , my Husband came Home drunk one Night and beat me , upon which says Billings , This fellow deserves to be kill 'd , and says Wood I 'd be his Butcher for a Penny , and I told 'em they might do as they would , and so they made a Contrivance to kill him ; but I did not know that they 'd do it the Night that it was done on . And why , says I , did not you tell your Husband of this Design to murder him ? Because says she , I was afraid that he 'd beat me . Joseph Mercer thus depos 'd . The Monday after the Prisoner was committed to Newgate ; I went to see her . - Mr. Mercer , says she . you are Tom Billing 's Friend as well as mine , and therefore pray go and tell him , 't is in vain for him to deny the Murder of my Husband any longer , for we are both Guilty , and must both die for it . John Blakesly thus depos 'd . I live at the Brawns-Head in New-Bond-Street . On the 1st of March last , about 4 in the Afternoon , the Prisoner and 2 Men that pleaded Guilty , came to our House for 6 Quarts of Mountain , which she paid for at the Bar , and saw it put into Bottles . I sent a Porter Home with her that he might know where to fetch the Bottles when they were Empty , but about 9 the same Night , one of those two Men brought back the Empty Bottles , and had another Quart of Wine away with him , in a Bottle which he brought besides ours . Mary Springet thus depos 'd . I lodged up Stairs in the House where the Murder was Committed . I had been out all Day at Work , and came home between 8 and 9 at Night , My Husband told me there had been great Merrimaking below , Drinking , and Dancing , and Singing . I was tired and wanted to go to Bed , but I was willing first to know if their Liquor was almost out that I might not , be disturbed when I went to Rest . - And so I came down and tap 'd at the Door , and ask 'd her if they had almost done Drinking ; ay , Child , says she , I am just not a going to Bed ; and so up I goes again , and not long after I heard the Door open , I call 'd and asked who it was that went out . O says She it is my Husband , he 's gone into the Country with a Charge of Money , and I am frighted out of my Wits for fear he should be Murder 's . I wish he may come safe Home , but I never knew such an Obstinate Man in my life , when he gets a little Liquor . - There was no persuading him to stay till Morning . I went out early next Day which was Wednesday , and return 'd about 9 at Night . The Prisoner was sitting by the Fire , but without a Candle in the Shop , with Wood and Billings . She again shew 'd a great deal of uneasiness for her Husband , for fear some wicked Rogue or other should knock him on the Head for his Money . I went into my own Room , but had not been there long before I heard something drawling along the Floor , and 2 Men go out at the Door . I came down , again and asked what they were doing . She said those 2 Men were going to fetch a Bed home , when they came back they brought only a Broomstick with them , and said that they had not Money enough for the Bed . - I went up again , and by and by I heard another drawling upon the Floor , and the Men went out again . - When they return 'd I let them in my self , but they had not yet bought the Bed . What says she , was the Landlords Mark upon the Bed ? Yes , say they . Why then , says She I am glad you did not bring it . I left them , and once more went to my own Room : In a little time I heard another Bustling below . I begun to be very uneasy , and thought that something more than ordinary must be the Matter , and so I was going down again ; but the Prisoner met me at my Door , and told me she was come to smoke half a Pipe with my Husband . While she staid I heard the Men going out again , and I stept to the Stair-Head and look 'd down . She follow 'd me , and ask 'd why I was so uneasy . Truly , says I , Mrs. Hays I believe your ' r a going to move your Goods by Night , and I think its Shame you should do so when you have got Money that lies by you . - No indeed , says She its no such thing . Why then pray Mistress Hays tell me what is the Matter ? Why nothing , says she . - I beg you to make your self easy . The next Day which was Thursday , I saw Wood go out with a Bundle , and turn down Swallow Street . I asked her what that Bundle was , why , says she , 't is a Suit of Cloaths that be borrow 'd to go abroad in Last Sunday . - The Head that was thrown into the Thames at Mill Bank , and the Pail that it was carried , in , were both brought to me at the Gate-house to see if I knew 'em , and I did know that the Head was Mr. Hayns 's and that the Pail was his Pail , and this is his Coat . - At the sight of the Coat , the Prisoner at the Bar fainted away , but being recover 'd , Richard Bows thus depos 'd , on Thursday the 5th of March , Thomas Wood came to Lodge at my House and brought this Coat with him , which Mrs. Springet Swears was the Coat of the Deceas 'd . The Prisoner in her Defence acknowledged , that 3 or 4 Days before her Husband was kill 'd , She knew that there was a Design against his Life , and that she was in the next Room when the Murder was done , but said that she had no Hand in it , and therefore she was clear of his Blood . The Jury found her Guilty . [ Death .

They call us King Georges Dogs , and gave us other abusive Language . - Sir says I to Andrews , if you dont mend your manners , I shall carry you Prisoner to the Guard . - Will you says he but I 'll Stick you to the Heart first , and then pull 'd out a naked Knife , upon which I Collar 'd him and kickt up his Heels by the side of a Dunghill . My Comrade might then be about 2 Yards behind me , and his Candle was beat out . Andrew got up again and went towards my Comrade . The Prisoner came up to me and I collar 'd him .

On Sunday the 27th of Feb. about Noon , I came into George's-Coffee-House , in Devereux-Court , and saw Mr. Brograve standing by the Fire with his Cloak on , which I took Notice of to him , it being a remarkable warm Day ; he told me that he had lately been very ill. We sat down at a Table together , and talked of indifferent Things When we had sat about half an Hour , the Deceas 'd came in and said something at the Bar , upon which the Prisoner said Here ! and presently steps to the Deceas 'd , and they went out together .

Thomas Trout thus depos 'd . I am Servant at George 's Coffee-House . A Gentleman whom I never ( to my knowledge ) saw before , came up to our Bar , in a Red Cloak , and asked for Mr. Brograve , who answer 'd Here ; and got up directly .

Then each of 'em took off his Hat and Wig , and held out a Pistol . - Says the Prisoner , Fire . No ( says the Deceas 'd ) do you fire first - You ought to do that , says the Prisoner . - Well then , say , the Deceas 'd , let as fire both at once , and so they did , and both mist , then they drew their Swords .

They closed , struggled together , the Deceas 'd fell backward , and the Prisoner upon him ; the Prisoner then took away the Deceas'd 's Sword , and they both got up , but the Deceas 'd stagger 'd , and fell down again . The Prisoner call 'd me to him , and said to the Deceas 'd . Speak , who was in the Fault ? Will ye forgive me ? - Pray forgive me . But the Deceas 'd could make no Answer ; the Prisoner desir 'd me to call a Coach , but I was Weak , and could not run nor call aloud His Sword was bloody , and crooked . He wiped it on the Grass , and streighten 'd it , and then waved his Hat for a Coach at Hyde-Park Corner .

Says I . Why , says he , in setting me to work about this pitiful business , in which there 's nothing to be got , and employing another Gentleman in your Affairs of great Consequence ; and beside you have injur 'd my Character in another Affair and by G - I 'll have satisfaction , and then shew 'd me two Pistols which he had brought with him . - I endeavour 'd in vain to pacify him , and he swore if I offer 'd to stir from him , he 'd shoot me . Some Notice has been taken of my wearing a Cloak on a warm Day , as if it was with a Design to conceal my Pistols , or to favour my Escape . But I only wore it to prevent catching Cold , for I had been ill for a Fortnight before . as I can prove . Nor was my being at the Coffee-House the Consequence of any Assignation .

I went to her Father , and asks him how he could use his own Child in such a Manner What 's that to you , says he . Have ye a Mind she should come to be Hang 'd or Transported ?

The Mollies had heard something of the first Discovery , but did not imagine how far he had proceeded , and what further Designs he had upon them . - By his means we were introduced to the Company , at the Prisoners Lodging 's . There were 8 or 9 of them in a large Room , one was playing upon a Fiddle , and others were one while dancing in obscene Postures , and other while Singing baudy Songs , and talking leudly , and Acting a great many Indecencies . - But they look 'd a skew upon Mark Partridge , and call 'd him a treacherous , blowing-up Mollying Bitch , and threatned that they 'd Massacre any body that betray 'd them . The Prisoner was very fond of us , and kist us all at parting in a most indecent manner , Edward Sanders in behalf of the Prisoner depos 'd , That he never heard any such report of the Prisoner before ; That he was born and bred at Newbury , and was esteem 'd an honest Man , The Jury found him Guilty . Death . George Whytle alias Whittle , was indicted for committing Sodomy , with Edward Courtney , December 1 . Edward Courtney thus depos 'd . The Prisoner kept an Ale-House , the Royal-Oak , the Corner of St. George's-Square in Pall-Mall , where he keeps a back Room for the Mollies to drink in , and a private Room betwixt that and the Kitchen , there is a Bed in it , for the Use of the Company , when they have a Mind to be married , and for that Reason , they call that Room , The Chappel . - And there he has brought me to several Husbands , as we used to call them . And one Day he told me , Ned , says he , There 's a Country Gentleman of my Acquaintance that 's just come to Town , and if you 'll give him a Wedding Night , he 'll pay you very handsomely . - I staid till Mid-Night , but no Gentleman came , and then it was too late for me to go home , and so the Prisoner said I should lie with him , and I did . Then he promis 'd me a great deal of Money , if I would let him commit Sodomy with me . I agreed to it , and he did , but in the Morning he gave me no more than 6 Pence . - Mr . Rigs depos 'd , that for 2 or 3 Years past , it was commonly reported , the Prisoner 's House was a Receptacle for Sodomites . Drake Stoneman thus depos 'd . For 2 or 3 Years past , I have seen Men behave themselves very indecently in the Prisoner 's back Room , in exposing to each other 's sight , what they ought to keep conceal 'd , - and they used to retire to a little Room in the Passage . The Prisoner in his Defence , first objected against the Credit of Courtney 's Evidence , he being a scandalous Fellow , and had been thrice in Bridewell . - 'T is true , says Courtney , I have been there three Times , but was for no harm , and I 'll tell ye how it happen 'd . - First I it was Servant at the Cardigan's-Head at Charing-Cross . I went to see the Prisoner , he made me drunk in his Chappel , and when I came home , I abused my Master 's Mother , for which I was sent to Bridewel , and my Master would not take me in again . Then I went to live at a Molley House , but my Master broke , and in helping him to carry off his Goods by Night , a Constable stopt me , and because I was saucy , and would not tell him where the rest of the Goods were , I was carried before a Justice , and sent to Bridewel the second Time . The third Time was only for raising a Disturbance about a Mollying Cull in Covent-Garden . - The Prisoner proceeded in his Defence . I unfortunately ( says he ) let a Shop to one Johnson a Barber , whose Wife was a Woman of a very scandalous Character , she has been in Newgate for Perjury , and it was from her that such Things were reported of me , for when ever she got drunk , she used to call me a Sodomite . - I had a Wife , she has been dead these 2 Years . I had 2 Children by her , one of them is dead , but the other is here in Court , a Girl of 13 Years old . - I was upon the Point of visiting another Widow , upon the Account of Marriage , just before this Misfortune broke out . - As for what Drake Stonemen says , about some Things , that he has seen in my back Room , there is nothing in it , but that some young Surgeons of my Acquaintance , used to bring their Patients to my House , and there examine their Distempers , and make Applications in that Room . Peter Greenaway thus depos 'd . Ned Courtney was bound to my Master . - He told me that one Butler , a Chairman , was the first Person that he had to do with . - And that the Occasion of his quarrelling with the Prisoner , was , because the Prisoner would not let him have a pint of Beer when it was late . William Crowyard and William Bayle Depos 'd , that they had lain with the Prisoner several Times in his Wife 's Lifetime and never found any Thing in his Behaviour , that might give the least Ground to suspect him inclinable to Sodomy . Several of his Neighbours appear 'd to his Character . Some of them acknowledg 'd that they had heard such Things whisper 'd , and some depos 'd that they never heard of any Thing like it , Ann White thus depos 'd . I have been the Prisoner 's Servant ever since October last . - I never saw Ned Courtney at our House , - and I think I should have seen him , if he had lain there all Night with my Master . - I know no Room they call the Chapel , and never saw any Encouragement given to any uncivil Persons .

I desir 'd him not to treat me ill , and take what he could find . He took my Watch , an old Crown Piece , a half Crown , and my Hat , and so went away .

The House joining to mine was empty . I look 'd out , and saw the Casement open too , and I suppose , that was the Way that he got in . I advertiz 'd it , and enquir 'd among the Pawnbrokers , and so did my Master Burgess , for whom I made the Goods . At last we heard that it was offer 'd to be pawn 'd by the Prisoner 's Wife , to Mr. Woolham , in Petticoat-lane , but he refus 'd to take it in .
