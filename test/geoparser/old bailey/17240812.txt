The Prosecutor depos 'd , that she being to go to Hampstead , about ten or eleven a Clock in the Forenoon , met with the Prisoner at Black Mary 's Hole , and inquiring of him the Way to Pancrass , he told her he was going thither , and would conduct her ; that they went together through Pancrass-Church-Yard , and coming to an Alehouse , the Prisoner would needs call for Drink , and was very urgent upon her to drink with him ; but she refus 'd ; till at last he sitting down on an Alehouse Bench , and having call 'd for Drink , he over-perswaded her , and she did sit down at the other end of the Bench , and did drink part of a Pint of Drink , he very much pressing her , and telling her there could be no harm in it , and taking her by the Hand , constrained her to sit down ; that afterwards they went to Kentish-Town , and the Prisoner call 'd at the Black Lion for some Brandy , and urged her to drink a Dram with him , which she did ; that then she inquiring the Way to Hampstead , the Prisoner told her he would show her the Way , and she not knowing it , he carry 'd her through by-Fields , that went towards Highgate , and in the Fields opening her Hand by Force , took the Ring off from her Finger , and turned into another Field out of the Way , that she followed him and asked him for her Ring , to which he replyed , he would give it her again presently , but did not , but offered Rudeness to her , that he carried her round about for a great while , telling her , she was in her way to Hampstead , till at last she found to the contrary ; that she having a Calamanco Gown in her Handkerchief , he took that from her also , and told her now she was obliged to follow him ; that he carried her rambling about , calling at several Places , but she was afraid to charge him with her Ring , & c. for fear he should do her some Injury , because they were People of his Acquaintance , till at last they had wandred till they came into Long Alley , and at the Sign of the Dolphin he went in , and gave the Gown to the Maid , and bid her not deliver it to her till the next Morning , but she being resolved not to go without it , the Gown was given to her again , that after that the Prisoner went with her to the House where she lodg 'd , and her Landlord being a Constable , she demanded her Ring of the Prisoner , but he deny 'd that he had it , but owned it the next Morning . That he did deny having the Ring , on the over Night , was proved by two Evidences . And that he produc 'd it the next Morning in the Counter , was depos 'd by the Prosecutor 's Landlord , the Constable . The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded , That he having some Business at Kentish Town was going thither , and as he was sitting on a Stile near Pancras , the Prisoner came to him and ask 'd him the way to Pancras , that he directed her , and when they came to the Adam and Eve , he sat down on one end of the Bench , and called for a Pint of Drink , and the Prosecutor sat down on the other , and fumbling with her Hand in her Pocket , began to complain that she had the Misfortune to lay her Money down at home , instead of putting it in her Pocket , and so had left it behind her , otherwise she would have had a Pint of Ale and a Cake ; that he replyed , she was very welcome to drink with him , that he drank to her , and she drank , edging nearer and nearer to him , from one end of the Bench to the other , that the Landlord brought some Cakes , and she took one ; that then they went forward to Kentish Town , and went to the Black Lion , and called for 2 or 3 Pints of Drink , and for 3 half Quarterns of Brandy , which tho ' she refused at first , she afterwards drank very freely . That then she enquired the way to Hampstead , that they having staid there 3 or 4 Hours , he then went to speak to some Farmers about putting 2 Horses to Grass , that the Prosecutor went with him , that he went no By-ways , nor did violently take the Ring ; but the Prosecutor gave him the King as a Pledge , for her Part of the Expence he had been at , in their long Journey , that she also gave him the Gown to carry for her , which he did , that at length , at Night , arriving in Town , at Long Alley they went in to drink , and had 3 Pots of Drink , and at another Place 2 or 3 half Quarterns of Brandy , and then he went with the Prosecutor to her own Lodgings , it being about 11 a Clock at Night . That this was their Progress , that he did not rob her of her Ring , and he hoped God was above the Devil Still . Another Evidence depos 'd , That the Prosecutor and Prisoner came to his House at the Dolphin in Long Alley , about 7 or 8 a-Clock at Night , and staid there till 11 , and had three Pints of Drink , that the Prisoner had a Ring on his Finger , and he asked him if it was his own , that he reply 'd no , it was the young Women 's , that they drank very familiarly together , were very loving ; that the Prisoner kissed the Prosecutor , and she again the Prisoner several times , and afterwards he ( this Evidence ) also kissed the Prosecutor , that after they had drank their Drink with much Pleasaniness , they went away lovingly together , she taking the Prisoner hold by the Arm , and went away like Man and Wife , or like Whore and Rogue , and he took them all the while to be in a sort of Courtship . Another Evidence depos 'd , That he was present when the Prisoner and Prosecutor came in , and were very familiar and loving , kissing one another with that Freedom , that tho ' he was an old Man , it made him blush , that the Prosecutor said to the Prisoner , my dear , I hope we shall drink together , we have been together all Day , and I am dry , that she said she was a little faint , and Brandy was called for , and they drank together , and afterwards went away very lovingly together . Upon a full bearing of the Matter , the Jury accquitted him . Alice Crofts , of the Parish of St. Giles Cripplegate , was indicted for feloniously stealing the Goods of Joseph Anderson , the 11th of July last . The Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found her guilty to the value of 10 d. Transportation . Charles Harrison , Esq ; of the Parish of St. Paul Covent-Garden , was indicted for the Murther of Mr. Alexander Agnew , by giving him one mortal Wound with a Sword , of the Length of one Inch , and the Depth of Six Inches , on the right part of his Breast , the 4th of this Instant August , of which Wound he immediately died . He was also indicted a Second Time on the Coroner 's Inquest . And also a Third Time , upon the Statute of Stabbing . John Adams depos 'd , That Major Harrison and Captain Agnew came to the Lubeck 's Head in Maiden Lane , about 11 a Clock at Night , and called for a Bottle of Burgundy , that he carried it , and filled out a Glass , that they afterwards asked for his Master , and his Master went up , and brought down that Bottle of Burgundy , and carried up a Bottle of French Wine , that he afterwards heard the Bell ring in the Lion , and went up , and the Gentlemen wanted some Snuff , that he sent the Porter for it , and carried it up , that they also called for another Bottle , which was carried up , and they were talking together very friendly , and disputing on some Argument , but he knew not about what , that Capt . Agnew went to the Window , and Major Harrison went to him and laid his Arm over him very friendly , that near one a Clock he heard in that Room , the Noise of stamping of Feet like 2 Men parrying and pushing at one another , that he immediately ran up , and before he got up Stairs , the Bell rung , and when he went to the Room , he met the Major coming towards the Door , with two Swords drawn in his Hand , and taking him by the Collar , he led him to Capt . Agnew , who was sitting in a Chair in the Room , bleeding , that he said to him , Dear Sir , did you not draw your Sword first ? And Capt . Agnew answered , he did , and the Major bid him this Evidence take Notice ; that one of the Swords was bloody , which he thinks was the Major 's , it was a mourning Sword , and the Major 's Clothes were light coloured trimm 'd with black ; that he carried down the Swords , informed his Master , and ran away for the Surgeon , who when he came , dressed his Wound , and afterwards laid him on the Table , and the Surgeon bidding him get a Chair , he fetch 'd one , and they carried him down Stairs , and he and another went on each side of the Chair , holding a Napkin before him to keep him from falling or rocking , but before they came to his Lodgings in Hemming 's Row , he was dead . Edward Thorp depos 'd , that he being a-sleep behind the Bar , all being in Bed , but one Drawer , the Porter , and himself , about one a Clock in the Morning the Drawer brought down two Swords , telling him , one of the Gentlemen was wounded , and that he immediately ran up Stairs , and saw the Deceased sitting on the Ground stooping , that they listed him up , and sat him on a Chair , and the Drawer ran away for a Surgeon , that he called a Coachman and sent him up ; that when the Deceased was taken off the Ground he sighed and groaned very much . Joseph Thorp depos 'd , that the Major and Capt . Agnew came to his House , he being then at the Bar , and desired to have a Bottle of Burgundy , which they had ; but afterwards would have Claret , which he carried up to them , that they seemed to be very friendly . That be went to Bed , and was called up , about a Quarter past one a Clock , but did not see the Deceased till Mr. Small the Surgeon came to dress him . Thomas Stonystreet , an Apothecary 's Apprentice depos 'd , That he was present while Mr. Small the Surgeon dress 'd the Deceased , that when he came in , the Deceased was sitting in a Chair , that Major Harrison ask 'd the Captain , if he himself ( the Captain ) was not the Aggressor , and he answered he was . Mr. Stone depos 'd , that he being Beedle , was all 'd , and when he went , the Deceased was laid on the Table , and the Major said to him , Sir , it was your own seeking , and I am sorry for it . Mr. Carter the Constable said , he also being call 'd , went , and the Captain was lying on the Table , and after some time stirred his Hand , and raised himself , and sat up , and the Major said to him , Sir , you have already said it to the Drawer , say before the Constable , did you not draw your 8 word upon me , and Capt . Agnew reply 'd , I did draw my Sword first . This was the third time he had owned it , and at that time said , is there no Body to attend me , no Body to help me , and the Apothecary 's Man wiped the Spittle from his Mouth , he being too weak and saint to discharge it . Mr. Small the Surgeon depos 'd , he dressed the Deceased , that the Wound was half an Inch broad , and an Inch and a half backwards near the right Pap , and that Major Harrison desired him to take Care of him , and also ask 'd the Deceased , if himself had not been the Cause of this , and he answered , ay , ay . The Major in his Defence pleaded , that this unfortunate Accident had brought upon him a great deal of Grief and Concern , that the Deceased and himself were Brother Officers in the Garrison of Dunkirk , in the Year 1710. and both of them having an Inclination for Books , it had occasioned their contracting an intimate Acquaintance , which had been continued with the strictest Friendship ever since , that the Day the Accident happened , they had been together , and walking in Lincolns Inn , they bespoke a Rabbet , & c. for Supper , and having supped , were together till about 11 a-Clock , and going thro ' Covent Garden heard there was a Fire , and not being willing to go home till they were satisfied how and where it was , they went to the Lubeck 's Head , as had been before depos 'd , that at the latter end of the first Flask , being in Discourse , the Deceased was drawing Parallels between the Roman and English Government , which he thinking carry 'd in them Reflections on the latter , it gave him Occasion to oppase him in his Argument . Which put the Deceased out of Temper , but he giving him soft Language , had brought him to Temper again , as he thought , and they were very friendly ; but after the bringing in of the second Bottle , the Captain return 'd to his ill Temper , and wish 'd there was a Case of Pistols in the Room , to which he reply 'd , for what , he hoped not for them to use , to which he answered , since there was not , they should decide it another way , by the Sword , and drew it , he begged of him for God 's sake to sorbear , but he grew violent , and push 'd at him , whereupon he retreated as far as he could for the Wall , and having drawn his Sword , put himself into a Posture of Defence , and the Captain made a very violent push at him , which he happily put by , and believes at the same Time he ran upon his Sword , and received the Wound , for he did not know that he was wounded till he told him that he was , and that having disarm 'd him , he immediately called for help , and took what care of him he could , sending for a Surgeon , and assisting him as well as he could . Colonel Sinclare , and a great many Persons of Character appear 'd to his Reputation , who gave him the Character of a peaceable , affable , inoffensive Gentleman ; and some others , among which was a certain noble Lord , gave the Deceased the Character of a Person who was so apt to be tenacious of his Argument , when in Discourse , as to be impatient of Contradiction . Upon a full hearing of the Matter , the Jury acquitted him of all three Indictments , bringing in their Verdict , Se Defendendo . Isaak Dearing , of the Parish of St. Dunstan 's Stepney , was indicted for feloniously stealing 1300 Pound Weight of Iron , the Property of John Trueman , and Company , and Company , the 29th of April last . To which Indictment he pleaded guilty . Burnt in the Hand . Joseph Sheppard , of the Parish of St. Martin in the Fields , was indicted for breaking the House of William Philips , and stealing divers Goods , the 14th of February last . But there not being sufficient Evidence against the Prisoner , he was acquitted . He was also indicted a Second Time , of St. Clement Danes , for breaking the House of Mary Cook , the 9th of February last , and stealing divers Goods : But the Evidence against the Prisoner being deficient as to this Indictment also , he was acquitted . He was also indicted the Third Time , of St. Mary Savoy , for breaking the House of Williams Kneebone , in the Night-Time , and stealing 118 Yards of Woollen Cloth , the 12th of June last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That the Prisoner had some Time since been his Servant , and when he went to Bed , the Time mention 'd in the Indictment , about 11 a-Clock at Night , he saw all the Doors and Windows fast ; but was call 'd up about 4 in the Morning , and found his House broken open , the Bar of a Cellar-Window having been cut , and the Bolts of the Door that comes up Stairs drawn , and the Padlock wrench 'd off , and his Shutter in the Shop broken , and his Goods gone ; whereupon suspecting the Prisoner , he having committed ill Actions thereabouts before , he acquainted Jonathan Wild with it , and he procured him to be apprehended . That he went to the Prisoner in new prison , and asking how he could be so ungrateful to rob him , after he had shown him so much Kindness ? The Prisoner owned he had been ungrateful in doing so , informing him of several Circumstances as to the Manner of Committing the Fact , but said he had been drawn into it by ill Company . Jonathan Wild depos 'd , The Prosecutor came to him , and desir 'd him to inquire after his Goods that had been stolen , telling him he suspected the Prisoner to have been concern 'd in the Robbery , he having before committed some Robberies in the Neighbourhood . That inquiring after him , and having heard of him before , he was informed that he was an Acquaintance of Joseph Blake , alias Blueskin , and William Field : Whereupon he sent for William Field , who came to him ; upon which he told him , If he would make an ingenuous Confession , he believ 'd he could prevail with the Court to make him an Evidence . That he did make a Discovery of the Prisoner , upon which he was apprehended , and also of others since convicted , and gave an Account of some Parcels of the Cloth , which were found accordingly . William Field depos 'd , That the Prisoner told him , and Joseph Blake , that he knew a Ken where they might get something of Worth : That they went to take a View of the Prosecutor 's House , but disapprov 'd of the Attempt , as not thinking it easy to be performed : But the Prisoner perswaded them that it might be easily done , he knowing the House , having liv 'd with the Prosecutor . That thereupon he cut the Cellar Bar went into the Cellar , got into the Shop , and brought out three Parcels of Cloth , which they carried away . The Prisoner had also confest the Fact when he was apprehended , and before the Justice . The Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found him guilty of the Indictment . Death . William Gouldstone , and John Thornycroft were indicted for a Misdemeanour in conspiring to defraud Sir James Thornhill , of 2001 . But the Fact not being prov 'd , the Jury acquitted them . Joseph Oliver , was indicted for a Misdemeanour , in selling to Joseph Pangford , a false Prize York Lottery , Ticket , for 20 Guineas , knowing , it to have been falsified . It appear 'd by the Evidence , That the Defendent , Joseph Oliver , was a Ticket Porter , who ply 'd at Aldgate , and that he did sell a Ticket to Joseph Pangford for 20 Guineas , as a Prize , which Ticket , when it came to the Office to be checqued , did appear to have been ( though a true Ticket ) a Blank , the Number of which having originally been 1906 , and was a Blank , was altered to 1908 , which was a Prize . The Defendant Oliver call 'd two of his Brother Porters to prove , That a Person appearing like a Gentleman just come out of the Country , with a lac 'd Hat , Boots , and a Whip in his Hand call 'd Porter , and they ran , but the Defendant being readiest at Hand , got the Jobb . That they saw him pull some Papers out of his Pocket , and give some to Oliver , and that he afterwards told them what the Jobb was . It also appear 'd by a Broker in Court , That the Defendant Oliver brought the Ticket to him from such a Gentleman to sell ; and that he not bargaining , it was afterwards told to the Complainant . So that it plainly appear 'd , That the Porter was impos 'd upon , and knew not any Thing of the falsifying , and that he was only imprudent in endorsing it to the Buyer , and parting with the Money to the Person who sent him , without taking an Account of who he was , and a Receipt . Upon which the Jury acquitted him . The Trials being over , the Court proceeded to give Judgment as followeth , viz . Received Sentence of Death , Six .
