He was likewise indicted upon the Statute of Stabbing . The Indictment against Mr. Regnier set forth : That he , not having the Fear of God before his Eyes , but being instigated and seduced by the Devil , on the 30th day of January last past , in and upon Isaac Symbole did make an Assault , and with a Rapier value 5 s. did give him one Mortal Wound in and upon the Right Pap , of the Breadth of One Inch , and of the Depth of Six Inches , of which he instantly died . The Sum of the Depositions against him , was in manner and form agreeable to what was declared against the three Women the last Sessions in the General , but as to the Particulars , the Reader may please to take it thus : On the day above said Mr. Regnier , with the two Sisters , came to Mr. Symbole 's house , and there brought Wine to drink with him , according to a former Appointment , and afterwards they fell to playing at Cards . Mr. Symbole being at an adjacent Alehouse was sent for , and being come home , they complimented each other very civilly ; then Mr. Symbole ordered a Supper to be drest , and after it was eat , they play 'd at Cards , the Game being Bone-Ace . The Prisoner and Mr. Symbole hapning to turn up two Sevens , they fell out about it , Mr. Symbole saying , that he would have the Cards dealt again : which Mr. Regnier refused ; Mr Symbole having won upon the same Lay before . So Mr. Symbole and the Prisoner had some hot words ; Mr. Symbole telling Mr. Regnier , That he was a Rogue , and had been in the Crown Office ? Why if I have , Says the Prisoner , yes I was never in the Pillory : Or words to that effect . From that they fell to Blows , but Mr. Regnier had a Sword all bloody ; which he was seen to wipe . The Maid of the house coming up Stairs , found her Master almost dead , but the Prisoner got away , so did the two Sisters , Mr. Symbole immediately dying . The Surgeon declared , that upon search of his Body , he found no less than Eighteen Wounds about him , Five of which was supposed Mortal . Mr. Regnier upon his Defence , proved that Mr. Symbole was a person of an evil temper , and passionate disposition , given to quarrelling , and called the two Sisters aforesaid , who were present , to give an account of the matter of Fact , who did both declare , That Mr. Symbole fell upon Mr. Regnier in a very violent manner and gave him a Blow on the Face with his Fist ; upon which , Mr. Regnier said he could not take that though it was in his own house : So Mr. Symbole persisted , and said , Let me come at him , I 'll knock his Brains out . But they could not part them , and being thus affrighted , they went away , and left them fighting , but did not see Mr. Regnier 's Sword drawn . The Prisoner called several other Witnesses , who gave account further , that the deceased Symbole was a very quarrelsom Man , and given to fighting ; particularly , that he had wounded one Mr. Lane in the head with a Tankard , he bruising the Tankard with the Blow : And that he used to abuse several persons that came to him for money , insomuch that Lane said he durst not ask him for the money he ow 'd him . And being once in the King's-Bench , he abused the Prisoners , insomuch that he was forced to be turned over to the Common-side , to keep him from doing further mischief ; being Iron 'd and kept close , till he had humbled himself to the Master . Mr. Regnier further alledged , That Mr. Symbole was too strong for him , and struck him several Blows ; taking a Fire-fork that was in the Room , and came to knock his Brains out : so he was forced to defend his Life with his Sword , and could not avoid what was done ; the Fire fork being found lying near Mr. Symbole when he lay dead . He also called several Persons of Quality , who declared on his behalf , That he was a very civil and sober temper 'd Man , never given to any quarrelling , but of a fair Reputation , and never given to take offence , nor give any ; that he was a Gentleman that came of a good and very worthy Family , and a Barister at Law . Then he proceeded further , That there was no Evidence of Malice , and the Room was so little , that he could no ways give back , or get from Mr. Symbole , to avoid his wrath ; and therefore he was very sorry for so great a misfortune yet hoped that by what account he had given of the Disposition of the deceased , and of the Reputation of himself , the Court would consider so maturely of the Fact , as that he should be accounted innocent . Then the Court summ 'd up the Evidence on both sides to the Gentlemen of the Jury very distinctly , and upon the whole matter , the Jury having well consider 'd the matter of Fact , they returned this Verdict , That Mr. Regnier was guilty of Manslaughter only , and not guilty upon the Statute of Stabbing .
