The Prosecutor deposed , that the Prisoner had been employed in the house to go of errands , and heat irons for the workmen ( he being a Taylor ) and having been gone 3 weeks , came to the house the night the robbery was committed , under pretence of receiving some small matter of money due to him from the journey-men for the cleaning their shoes , and took the opportunity of stealing his money , breaking open a chest which was in his closet .

The Woman likewise owned she had 19 Guineas of the Boy , but said she knew not of his robbing his Master , but that he told her they were sent him by an Uncle out of the Country . There were some evidences that confirmed that circumstance : so it not appearing she was privy to the Robbery , nor proved that she knew how he came by the Money , she was acquitted , and the Boy found guilty of the indictment . [ Death . See summary . ] Elizabeth Knolls , alias Derrick , alias Duscoby , of the Parish of St. Dunstan 's Stepney , was indicted for picking the Pocket of Francis Longepee of 10 Guineas , the 25th of April last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That having been at Limehouse , and coming home , near Stepney , the Prisoner fell into his company , and pretended she wanted to buy gold-colour 'd Silk , which he , being a Weaver , was willing to sell her ; That she came with him near his own house , and then he bid her go into a neighbouring Ale-house and he would go fetch her gold-colour 'd Silk ; whereupon he went home and put a purse with 20 Guineas into his Wast-coat pocket , but did not go to the Ale-house to show it her , but sent his boy for her to come home to see it ; That she being with him in the Chamber , took his Purse out of his pocket , and taking out a Guinea bid the Boy fetch a bottle of Cyder and a quartern of Brandy , and then put his Purse again into his pocket ; that afterwards examining his Purse , expecting to find the remaining 19 Guineas , he found but 9 . Whereupon he sent for a Constable to apprehend her , but in the interim she desir 'd to go to do her Occasions , and before the Officer came made an Elopement . The Prosecutor 's Boy depos 'd , That his master came home at the time beforementioned , and put the bag of Guineas into his pocket , and seat him to the Sugar Loaf in Coverlays Fields to call the Prisoner to him ; that she was admitted into his chamber , and there was very familiar with his Master , taking his Purse out of his pocket , and thence a Guinea , bidding him fench a bottle of Cyder and a quartern of Brandy ; which he refusing to do , and not willing to go out of the room and leave them together , because he said he suspected her to be a very ill person , and his master not to be very capable , therefore he would not go out of the room ; so the Liquors were fetch 'd by another . And that the Prisoner desir 'd his absence , threating that if he offer 'd to speak a word against their Conversation she would kill him upon the spot . And that when his mistress came in , he inform 'd her what sort of a Companion his master had gotten with him ; whereupon she went in and interrupted their Conversation , and examining her Husband 's purs missed 10 Guineas . The Prisoner in defence gave an account of the matter to this purpose : That as she was selling Oranges the Prosecutor bought a dozen of her , giving her a , Shilling for them ; that he liked his bargain and her so well , that he carried her to a Publick house , and treated her and another Woman very generously with Beer , Cyder and Brandy ; staying out all night , that they were at several places , and particularly at Stepney ; that he was very sweet upon her , courting her , telling her he was a single Man , importuning her to go home with him and be his Housekeeper ; that she was prevail 'd upon by his Importunity and fair Offers : At length he sent for a Coach , and making use of that conveniency , convey 'd her into Coverlays Fields near his own house , gave her money to go into the Sugar Loaf Ale-house to stay there till she heard further from him . Accordingly she attended at the Ale-house as he directed , till his Servant came to call her home , whither she went , was well receiv 'd , and kindly admitted into his Chamber . That the former civilities were repeated ; he puiling out a Guinea and sending for a bottle of Cyder and quartern of Brandy , showing her his cupboard of plate : and that while she was pleasing her self with the thoughts of what she was brought to be mistress of , the Prosecutor 's Wife , to her great surprize , came in , and made such a noise in her Ears , that she not sustaining the storm any longer , got away as soon as she could , to her no small mortification at the great Disappointment she had met with , incoming to a Nest so well feather 'd . The Court putting the question home to the Prosecutor , whether in truth he did not pick up the Prisoner ? he frankly acknowledg 'd he did pick her up , but not to pick his Pocket . But was answer 'd , that considering the Years he always bore abroad , and that he had a Wife at home , him loss of 10 Guineas ( were they lost ) was not too great a punishment for his scandalous Practices , tho ' that would not excuse her could the Felony be proved upon her . Tho ' there was one thing remarkable , that she treated the Prosecutor with a modesry unusual to such Practitioners , in that she took no more than 10 Guineas out of 20 , when they commonly take all if they can get it , and only leave their Cully the rest . It plainly appearing the Prosecutor was so very much in drink that he might possibly mistake as to the number of his Guineas , the Jury acquitted her . Mary Compton alias Crumpton of London , was indicted for privately stealing 24 Bath-mettal Knife-hafts , value 15 s. out of the shop of Samuel Wilson , the first of April last . The Prosecutor 's Servant depos 'd , That the Prisoner came to his Master 's shop to buy some Shoe-Clasps , and that while he was fetching them he perceiv 'd her to take the Knife-hafts , whereupon he apprehended her ; and sending for an Officer , he and the Maid carrying her up stairs , search 'd her , but could not find them upon her , whereupon the Prisoner went away ; but the Maid coming down stairs , saw one of the Hafts dropp 'd upon the stairs , upon which the Boy following of her , took her with the Hafts in her hand , all but two .

Hollyday deposed , that the prisoners and he met at the Harpin Grays-Inn-Lane , to console in order to rob the Mail , agreed upon it , and the pretence was to be , that they had a Commission from the Pretender , who was at Bristol ; that it was to have been put in execution the Sunday before , but that they were disappointed of their Horses ; that on Tuesday-night they met at about 9 a clock , took horse , and went towards Branford said till about 4 in the morning , and not seeing the Post-boy thought he had been gone by , and were for returning ; but while they were covering their horses , he came by , and that they did at the Post-boy had before related , and brought the Packets to Chessey 's house in Fetter-lane .

Upon which they thought themselves unsafe there ; and one of them saying he had a friend at the Black Dog in shoreditch , whom be had trusted very considerably , and believing they might be safe under his roof , the Letters were accordingly carried thither : That they found no booty in the Letters they opened on Wednesday : that one concern 'd having business that he could not attend on Thursday , they were lock 'd up at the Black Dog till Friday-morning ; that on Friday-morning they met there , eat a Breakfast ; till the man of the house was up ; then they went up stairs , had a fire made , a large table set , and having hung up her Ridinghood against the key-hole , Chessey fetch 'd out the bag , laid it down upon the table , and fell to opening the Letters , that they found 3 Chequer-Notes of an 100 l. each , and 3 Bank- Notes of 20 l. each , which they distributed equally ; that there was likewise a Bank-Note of 35 l which being an odd sum , they sent her and Chessey 's wife to lay it out in Plate , which they did , buying 2 Tankards,6 Spoons , and 3 Gold Rings , which also were divided amongst them ; and that the Prisoners took each of them their parts of the Letters and carried them and dropt them in Moor-fields , & c. Chessey 's wife and she going before to see all safe ; and that they found likewise a Bank-Note of 25 l. which her husband had to receive the money at the Bank , which he deposed he carried into Cannon-street to an Alehouse at the sign of the Cripple , and calling for a Porter , bid him go to the Bank to receive the money . Reeves the Porter deposed , that he plying at the corner of the street was called , and that Holliday gave him the 25 l. Note to go to the Bank to receive the money , which he did , and that there the Note and he were stopped ( notice having been given of it before ) and that the next morning came Holliday 's Wife and one Peacock a porter along with her to the sign of the Cripple , and enquired for the Porter that a North-Country Gentleman had sent the night before with a Bank-Note , saying , that last night he got drunk , and so could not come for it himself . Peacock the Porter deposed , that he plying in Holbourn was called to Holliday and sent along with his wife to the sign of the Cripple on this errand . The Porter Reeves appeared that had carry 'd the Note to the Bank , and told 'em , the Landlord of the house had the money in his hands , which they demanding he fetch 'd down , and was telling it out to Peacok and the Woman , but telling it wrong , sometimes 19 for 20 , and sometimes 22 for 20 , on purpose to protract the time while he sent word to the Bank , some persons came from there and apprehended them ; and the fact being charged home upon her , and some promises of indemnity to her husband . she at last discovered where he was ; so they went to the Coach and Horses in Holbourn and apprehended him , and by his direction the Prisoners . It was sworn likewise , that Chessey had some of the Letters taken out of the Mail in his Pocket , when he was apprehended . Several of these things were confirmed by a variety of Evidences . The Prisoners deny 'd the fact , Said they were innocent of it , and knew no more of it them the child unborn . Chessey deny 'd he had been upon the back of a Horse or Mare for twelve months last past . Williams labour 'd to invalidate the evidence of Holliday , saying he was a great Rogue , had been in all the Goals in England , was a perjur 'd , Villain , and stood convicted of Felony , and so could not be a legal Evidence ; he had been at charge to get the Copy of his Pardon produced in Court , which he pleaded in 1711 , saying he had not fulfilled the Conditions of it , and so flood still convict . But he neither proving his Conviction , nor the Nonperformance of the Conditions of his Pardon it bore no weight with the Court , and the Jury found them both guilty of the indictment . The Prisoners being asked what they had to say in Arrest of Judgement , Chessey insisted upon a promise of the Court that he should have the Tankard ; but was answer 'd , that he was promised so such thing , but only he should after Tryal have what was his Rights : That as he , being convict , had no legal Right to any thing , all being forfeited ; much less had be any to the Tackard , which had been Purchased with part of the money gotten by the Robbery for which he stood convicted . Francis Williams owned he was concerned in the fact after the Robbery , but deny 'd his being in it ; and pleaded , that when they examined the Letters , the rest were all illiterate and could not read , and would have burnt all the Letters and Writings that they did not make use of , and that a great fire was made , to whose flames they were all to be committed , that they might not rise up in judgement against them ; but he , being sensible of the consequences , and shock 'd at the barbarity of their design , opposed it , saying that Children unborn , and Generation to come , would be bound to Curse them for so Villainous an Action , by which they should have their Titles to Estates and Debts , & c . destroyed , asserting there were Packets of Bonds , Obligations and Deeds ; and as he had been the person that prevented so great a calamity , that would have affected all the Western parts of England , even as far as the Land 's End , he hoped the Recorder would represent him as an object of his Majesty 's mercy . But he was answered , that tho ' Writings should be by such accidents destroyed , persons did not therefore lose their Estates ; nor was it credible that Deeds of Estates , or such like things , were , or could be sent inclos 'd in Letters by the Post . However , he would represent to the King the case as it really was . [ Death .
