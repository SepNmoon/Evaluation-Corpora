Only that Man , the Prisoner , my Lord . Q. Pray did you know any of this Congregation ? Addison . Yes . There were three that lodg 'd in the same House ; a Man and his Wife and a single Woman . Q. I want to know how you knew these People ? Addison . I lodg 'd in the House , please you my Lord .

Prisoner . I was bred an Irishman ; served my Time at Newcastle upon Tyne . After I came up to London , I follow 'd my Business , and kept four or five Journeymen ; but met with many Losses . When I took in the Prosecutor , I took him in upon Charity : His Wife was an aged Woman . He pretended to go into Business as a Painter , and I never receiv 'd but 18 d. of him . When he went away , I took Pity on him , and I gave him a little Gin . At the other Lodgings they went to , I heard his Wife died for Want Please you , my Lord , I got a Lodger of mine to help him to carry a Linnen Bundle of Rags and Things they had to carry , and I said , Mr. Addison I hope you will make me Amends when it is in your Power . Upon this , I went once or twice to the other Lodgings . He had not got into Business , and there was no Relief from me . My Lord , the Time he absconded from the other Lodgings , he took something more than he should have done , but I can not testify it : His Landlord is here , he can : But one Time I met him in Rag-Fair , I said , Mr. Addison , I hear you have got into Business , and he and went away from me . I never saw him since , which is near a Year and a half ago ; but last Friday was a Month he came down to my House , and went to a Friend of mine ; he told my Friend he was come to pay me my Money , which was 3l . 10s . Upon this , my Friend sent his Boy with him to my House ; he told my Wife a fine Story , that he had married a Wife , and that he had got 300l . with her , and he would make me a Recompence to the last Halfpenny : My Wife desired him to stay longer ; but he desired I might come up to him to the Sign of the Boat ; so I sent my Wife to this House , and they sent to the Place where he order 'd them , and he came to my Wife , and she call 'd for a Pint of Beer , and she would have him drink . She said , I have brought you a Receipt ; says he , I never pay Money to a Wife . So when he came himself , he told me he would go and fetch my Money ; I went out of Doors to make Water ; he brought three Men and seiz 'd me , and would not let my Wife nor any Person know where they were going ; and they carried me before Justice Burdus . Says the Justice , he has sworn so hard against you , that I must commit you . I will commit you to New-Prison , that is the easiest Place I can commit you to . Prisoner . James Griffith . Q .

Did he ever make an Attempt to convert you to the Roman Catholick Faith ? North . I never heard him speak of any Thing of Religion in my Life . After his Lordship had summ 'd up the particular Evidences , he concluded thus ; Gentlemen , you are to consider whether the Prisoner at the Bar be guilty of this Fact or not : The Punishment is a very severe one , 't is perpetual Imprisonment without Bail or Mainprise . Before you convict the Prisoner of this , you ought to have full Evidence , and consider how this Fact appears . Addison , the Prosecutor , had known of these Things for a considerable Time : Makes no Discovery of it , 'till the Proclamation is publish 'd , of 100l . Reward , which is dated the 6th of November , 1745 , at St. James 's . In the next Place , Gentlemen , you 'll observe , the Man by his Appearance , does not seem to be a Man of Learning at all : It appears he has got his Livelihood , and a very mean one too , by dealing in Hair . A Number of Protestants have had Dealings with him . Some of them have lodg 'd in his House : They swear , they never saw any Appearance of his performing Mass or having any Images , nor of making any Attempts to convert them : And Persons of that Character are very apt to make Converts . Tho ' 't is true , where they endeavour to make Converts they ought to be punish 'd ; yet , Gentlemen , before they are punish 'd , there must Satisfaction be given to the Country , that they are guilty . In the present Case , it does appear , there is a Demand the Prisoner has on the Prosecutor : It is a considerable Circumstance in this Cafe , whether the Reward of 100l . is not to pay this poor Man the Prisoner , as appears by the Prosecutor 's needy Circumstances . Acquitted . 80 . 81.

James Williamson was indicted on Suspicion of Stealing 20 l. the Property of Thomas Jeffery of Greenwich , December 30 . Jeffery . I was going the 30th of December over London-Bridge ; opposite to the new Building upon the Bridge , I was forced to put up in a Door Way , to get out of the Way of the Coaches : I had no sooner got up in the Door-way , but a couple of Fellows rush 'd , the one behind and the other to one Side of me ; I striv 'd to get into the House , the Prisoner kept me from going back , and the other from going forward . They took an Opportunity , one of them , to pick my Pocket of 20 l. When the Coach was gone they went off . I had the Presence of Mind to clap my Hand to my Pocket , and I found my Money was gone . I cried out Stop Thief . In running I fell down , but got up again . This Williamson , the Prisoner , makes into a Pinmaker 's Shop at some Distance ; as soon as I cry 'd out Stop Thief , I saw a couple run ; and one , that is the Prisoner , went into the Pinmaker 's Shop . He endeavour 'd there to pull his Coat off , I suppose to disguise him-self : He ask 'd to buy some Pins . Asking to buy some Pins , the little Boy calls to the young Man : But he did not want any : But the young Man seiz 'd him : And when I came up , I said , you Rogue , you have robb 'd me , where is my Money ?

To the best of my Knowledge you are the Man . Q . ( to Jeffery ) Did this Person threaten you ? According to your Expression they pick 'd your Pocket . Was he taken into Custody ? Jeffery . Yes . Q . Then neither of these threaten 'd you , but only took this Money out of your Pocket by flight of Hand ? This can not possibly be any Robbery ; that must be a taking with Violence . This Indictment is for a Robbery on the Highway . Henry Payne . Please you , my Lord , I live with Mess . Hood and Dale on London-Bridge . On the 30th of December , about Five in the Afternoon , all of a Sudden , I heard a Noise of Stop Thief ; upon hearing which I run out of our Warehouse : I catch 'd the Prisoner at the Bar by the Collar , and turn 'd him on one Side of the Door Post ; I held him a few Minutes before the Gentleman that lost his Money came up . You Rogue , says he , you have robb 'd me of 20 l. I look 'd very sharp at him , but had not the Wit to search him . The Prisoner said he had not got the Money ; but before these Words were out of his Mouth I catch 'd the Bag between the Spar of the Post and my Foot ; upon which I directly call 'd to Mr. Jefferies , and said , here is your Money , and gave it into both his Hands and bid him hold it fast . I held the Prisoner still fast by the Collar ; and Mess . Hood and Dale were both at Home , and I call 'd my Master out of the Compting-House into the Shop . My Master came up ; I bid Mr. Jeffery take the Money , and they told it over and it was exactly 20 l. Prisoner ( to Payne . ) Did you see me drop the Purse ? Payne . Before the Words you express 'd to Mr. Jeffery , There is your Money , were out of your Mouth , I catch 'd it between the Spar of the Post and my Foot . John James . Please you , my Lord , on the 30th of December , 'near Five in the Afternoon , I live between half way of the Pinmaker 's and where Mr. Jeffery was robb 'd : I saw Mr. Jeffery fall down and get up again dirty .

A Woman cry 'd out , there is one run in there . Q . ( to James . ) Did you go into the Pinmaker 's Shop ? James . No , I stopp 'd at the Door , and then the Prisoner had almost got his Great Coat off . Q . What happen 'd after he came out of the Pinmaker 's ? James . Henry Payne was before him and I was behind him . I saw the Money taken-up by Henry Payne . After the Bag was taken up I went to Mr. H 's ; was with him all the Time .

There were two Dozen and eight Fowls , and six Ducks . Whilst I was bargaining I felt something justle against me , and immediately I miss 'd this Box , where there was a Guinea and a Half in Gold , and a Nine-shilling Piece in Gold . Turning short round about me , when I miss 'd them , I saw a young Lad stand , and the Prisoner at the Bar ; I clapp 'd hold of the young Lad , and said , I had my Pocket pick 'd , and cry 'd out , Give me my Money , give me my Box : And the Lad said , he had none of my Money , nor my Box .

I think they were then both standing by me ; but when I look 'd again they were both gone . Upon this I run five or six Yards through another Stall in Newgate-Market : I took the Prisoner in a Turning on the Right-Hand , while the other was running on the Left . I took him , and sat him down by me . I ask 'd him several Questions ; Who he was ? and , Whence he came from ? but he could give but a very indifferent Account . And in a Day or two he was had before an Alderman in Guildball ; there he was question 'd if he knew any thing of it ? He denied it ; he said he knew nothing of it . Afterwards , when we were coming out he said very wicked Words ; that he would have an Eye upon our Blood , or Words to that Purpose . John Lutwich . Please you , my Lord , I saw the Prisoner at the Bar , and another Lad , in the Market for near an Hour , walking about , the same Morning the Money was lost ; they did not seem to have any Business . I said to the next Neighbour , Take Care of your Pocket . I fear 'd these Fellows were upon an ill Design : Accordingly some Time after this Woman , the Prosecutrix , cries out , Pick-Pocket . I saw the other run away , and this one , the Prisoner , following of him . The Prisoner said of this Evidence , he would hang any Body for the Sake of a Reward . Q . ( to Martha Knight ) What have you to say against the Prisoner ? Knight . I saw the Prosecutrix have hold of a little Boy by the Shoulder .

Richard Warner , indicted for feloniously uttering and publishing a certain Acceptance of a Bill of Exchange , upon Richard Jackson , Esq ; of Crutched-Fryars , with an Intention to defraud Mr Ashley , of Ludgate-Hill . Council ( to Mr. Asbley ) Have you ever seen the Prisoner at the Bar ? Ashley . Yes . Q . What Paper is that you have got in your Hand ? Asbley . It is a Bill of Exchange , drawn upon Richard Jackson , Esq ; of Crutched-Fryars . The Prisoner brought it to me , and told me he had an Order from Richard Warner , Esq ; to buy of me fourteen Gallons of Rum and Arrack , six of which were for Sir Jacob Ashley , and the other Part for Richard Warner . Esq ; Q . How much did it come to ? Ashley . Eight Pounds eight Shillings and Sixpence . Then he presented this Bill , and he desir 'd the Change ; for he was to buy other Things with the rest of the Money . And looking on the Bill , I found it was not accepted : Upon which I told him I would send my Clerk and get it accepted . He then told me that Mr. Jackson seldom underwrit his Bills . Upon which I told him , if Mr. Jackson , or any of his Clerks , would say they would pay it , when it was due , I would be very well contented , and give him the Change . Q . Did you know Mr. Jackson ? Asbley . Yes , Sir , I know him by Character . Q . You would have taken the Bill if they had said they would pay it ? Ashley . Yes . But the Prisoner said he would carry it , and get it accepted . Accordingly he went out and brought it , with what he said was an Acceptance . But Jackson was spell 'd with an x , instead of ck ; the Name stood Jaxson . I then suspected it , but did not tell him so . I told him , if he would come To-morrow Morning , about Nine o'Clock , then the Things would be ready , and I would give him the Change . He was very pressing to have the Change that Night , and he would come for the Goods the next Morning . He had several Excuses , but I put him off . In the mean Time I sent to Mr. Jackson ; and the Answer my Clerk brought from Mr. Jackson , or some of Mr. Jackson 's Servants , that he had accepted no such Bill that Day , and that it was a Forgery , and desir 'd the Person and Bill might be stopp 'd . In the Morning , at the Time appointed , he , the Prisoner , came ; and at the same Time Jackson 's Clerk was at my House . Then the Prisoner took the said Bill out of his Pocket , and wrote the Indorsement upon it , and gave it to me . When I had it in my Possesion I shew 'd it to Mr. Jackson 's Clerk ; and he told me that was none of his Master 's Acceptance ; for it was neither like his Hand-writing , nor did he spell his Name so . Upon which he was charg 'd with the Constable , and had before my Lord Mayor , where Mr. Jackson was present , who is now here . Q . This Bill is mention 'd as drawn by Richard Warner , Esq ; Do you know whether he drew any such Bill in Fact ? Ashley . I believe the Whole was a Forgery . Q . ( to Richard Jackson ) Have you look 'd upon that Paper ? Jackson . Yes , Sir . Q . Do you know whose Hand-writing that is upon the Back ? Jackson . The Hand-writing upon the Back is the Indorsement of the Prisoner at the Bar . Q . Is it your Writing ? Jackson . No ; it is not my proper Name , nor my Manner of Writing . Q . Do you know Mr. Warner ? Jackson . Yes . But he never signs Richard Warner , Senior . Q . Do you believe Mr. Warner to be Uncle to the Prisoner ? Jackson . I believe he may ; I have seen him come from his Uncle . Q . Do you know of any Richard Warner of Cly ? Jackson . No . The Question and Doubt in Court arose , Whether this , in Point of Law , is Forgery within the Act of Parliament . To be sure , as was observ 'd , it was within the Meaning of the Act . Now , the Words of the Act of Parliament are ; That if any Person shall forge an Acceptance of a Bill of Exchange . No body has prov 'd that it was Mr. Warner 's Bill of Exchange : So that it was a bare Forgery of Acceptance , but not of an Acceptance of a Bill of Exchange . The Jury therefore laid it Special . 86. was indicted for stealing a Handkerchief and a Short Cloak , the Property of John Wallis . The Prisoner had little to say in her own Defence , but that she bought the Handkerchief in Flanders , and that , whereas the Prosecutor said it was a new one , it was really full of Holes .

Q . ( to Waldale ) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar ? Waldale . I am a Porter at Serjeants-Inn . On Wednesday the 23d of October last about half an Hour after Ten , I open 'd the Gate , for Mr. Halbert and his Lady to come into Serjeants-Inn ; and I standing at the Gate , while the Coach was coming out , this Manning , the Prisoner , comes up to me and shak 'd Hands , and tickled my Hands , and after that he come and ask 'd , How do you do Neighbour ? Q . Did you know the Prisoner ? Waldale . Never saw him with my Eyes before , as I know . He said , I knew him , but I said , I am sure I do not . But , says he , you do . So then he put his Hand on the Waistband of my Breeches , Said I , I know nothing at all of you , indeed Friend . So then he unbutton 'd his Breeches and let them full half Way down his Thighs . Q . Where was this ? Waldale . In the Middle of the Gateway . Q . In the Coachway ? Waldale . Yes . Q . Was the Coach come out by this Time ? Waldale . No . And I desir 'd him to walk a little farther up in the Inn and not to stand there , when he had let his Breeches down ; this I spoke to him that I might get the Gate shut . No , says he , I 'll stand here . So I said , I 'll secure you , and I call 'd out to my Wife . Mr. Hulbert hearing the Noise came out . He said , Waldale , what 's the Matter . I said , Sir , here is a Molly , a Sodomite , or a Devil , I know not what you call him , not I . So then Mr. Hulbert ask 'd me whether the Gate were shut ; I told him they were not . I call 'd , and my Wife took the Key , and Dr. Hulbert 's Man lock 'd the Gate . Then I went and serch 'd a File of Musqueteer 's from the Church , from thence I went to Mr. Money 's , the Constable and brought him ; from thence I took the Prisoner to the Watch-House ? from thence to Bridewell ; so then to his Lordship the next Day . Q . What did he pretend to when he was taken Waldale . He said , that I knock 'd him down . Q . But after you charg 'd him as a Molly , did he make any Defence at that Time , after his Breeches were down . Pray did he do any Thing after that ? Waldale . Only pull 'd them up . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Have you any Thing to say ? Prisoner . I was going down Fleet-Street , I was just come out of Jail . This Man , the Prosecutor , is as great a Villain as ever appear 'd in the World . I was coming down Fleet-Street , so Molly says he ; I said , I never mollied you . My Lord , I never laid my Hand upon him , nor touch 'd him ; I never touch 'd the Man in my Life . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Have you any Witnesses to your Character ? The Prisoner had none to appear to his Character . The Court proceeded to pass Judgement upon him as follows , viz . You have been indicted for as great an Offence as can be committed ; so great an Offence , that it shocks every virtuous Man to mention it . Of this you are now convicted , and your Case is still worse , as we are now inform 'd that you have before receiv 'd Judgement for the like Offence , therefore this is the second Offence of the Kind . The Court now sees that you are not easily reclaim 'd . And as a Terror to all others , you are sentenced to be set in the Pillory opposite Serjeants-Inn-Gate for the Space of one Hour , between the Hours of Eleven and One , and that you be imprison 'd for the Space of 12 Months .
