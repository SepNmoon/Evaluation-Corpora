Edward Eavley . I was coming from Black-Fryers about 1 o'Clock in the Morning , August the 16th , and I saw Alice King in Ludgate-Street ; I asked her the way to Cheapside : She said if I would give her a Dram she would show me . We went to a House in Black and White-Court , in the Old-Baily , and she call 'd for a Dram and bid me pay for it , it comes to 6 d. said she : I gave her a Shilling , and desir 'd her to return me 6 d. but she would not : I made words about my 6 d. and presently the other 5 Women came about me , and I felt one of their Hands in my Pocket ; Do n't pick my Pocket says I ; no , no , say 'd they ; but Susan Anthill , by Violence took the Watch out of my Pocket , and ran down half the Stairs , and jump 'd the rest ; I ran after her a little way and came back to the House , but I was obliged to cry out Murder before I could get out of it again , for all the Women were about me at once ; One had her Hands about my Wast ; another unty 'd , and pull 'd off my Apron , for I am a Porter . Q . And did not you Porter do very wisely to go along with these Women ? Alice Bunningham . I was Servant in the House . Q . And which of your Mistresses did this Man charge with stealing his Watch ? Bunningham . Susan Anthill ran down some of the Stairs , and jump 'd all the rest , and out of Doors she went directly ; but the next Day she told me , she had got the Porter 's Watch , and that she had pawn 'd it , but did not tell me where . Prisoner Anthill . I was coming from the Bar that night , at half an Hour past 12 , and I met this Woman and that young Woman , and I desired them to go make haste home and take care of my House : When I came home , I found my Door broke , my Maid drunk , and found that a Watch had been lost in my House . The Man told my Maid , he would give her a New Gown if she would swear against me , to transport me . Q . How come you to have this Maid for your Evidence ? Eavley . This Man ( the Beadle ) will tell you . Prisoner Anthill . This Man has had many a Shilling of mine . Beadle . The Watchman at 2 o'Clock told me there had been a great Hubbub at Anthill 's , I said 't was a very disorderly House , and going down , we met Anthill . I told her if she suffer 'd such doings at her House , she would soon he routed away . 'T is my impudent Maid , says she , that is the Occasion of this ; I am going home . When we came down , we found the Man stamping and making a Noise for his Watch ; and before we were admitted , the Man cry 'd out Murder : We made them open the Door , and he charged 4 Women with robbing him ( Anthill was not then in the House : ) We carry 'd them to the Compter , and the next Morning before Sir Richard Frocas , who sent them to Newgate .

Thomas Gibson . At the Time mention 'd in the Indictment , my Servant and I was at work in the Bake House : I sent my Servant out for a Thing we make use of in out Business , and he was seized in the Yard , and made a great Outcry : I was surpriz 'd , and took up a long Pole ( with which we rub the Fire about in the Oven , ) and went into the Yard , to see what the matter was ; but before I had got the length of the Pole , a Pistol was fir 'd at me , and wounded me in my Breast and my Arm : A second Pistol wounded me in my Face and beat me backwards : Two of them took me up in their Arms and laid me on the Ground in the Bake-House : Then they brought my Man in , and after they had taken him to several Places to shew them where the Candles were , they brought him to me , with a Handkerchief ty 'd before his Eyes , and sat him down by me : Two of them stood over us while the others robbed the House ; according to our Information , there was half a Dozen of them , and the Man who gave the first Information , was try 'd in this Court , and has been executed . After they had committed this Fact , they all sted to Ireland , but Ward , who made the Information against Row and Hampton . My Servant will swear to Row , and the Evidence that took him , will give an Account of his confessing the Fact . Eryan Bird . I was Servant to Mr. Gibson at the Time he was robb 'd , and was at work in the Bake house about 2 o'Clock ; I went into the Yard for a Scovel which hung on the Backside of the Oven , facing the Back house , Row and his Companions rushed on me , and I was so surprized , that I could not tell how many there were of them : but they presented Pistols to my Breast , and Row stood with a Sword to guard me , while the rest went into my Master . I heard them discharge a Brace of Pistols at him , and I saw the Flash of the Powder . Row afterwards made me go into the Bake-house , and seeing my Master lie upon the Ground , I thought he was dead : he made me stand with my Face to the Oven 's Mouth , and took his own Handkerchief , and bound about my Eyes , while the rest went up to rifle the House , They broke open a strong Door of a Chamber , and a Chest of Drawers , and took Money , and what they thought proper . As to Hampton we took him up on Suspicion before , but we could make nothing of him . John White . I went to Ireland in pursuit of Hall and Dillon : George Ward ( who was executed ) I took in Bridgewater . Row I took in Dublin last January , I was sent over , by the Justices of Bridgewater , with a Copy of Ward 's Confession . I charged the Prisoner with the Robbery , when I took him ; he deny 'd it at first , but when I shew 'd him ; Ward 's Confession , he said , if Mr. Gibson would make haste and get him over to England , he would be of Service to the Town ; and if his Evidence might be admitted , he would make a fuller Discovery than Ward had done : he said , Mr. Gibson might recollect , that he was more merciful to him , than any of the Rest . Bird . My Master is not able to give an Account of that , he was wounded , and in Pain . Row stood as a Guard , and Ward would have kill 'd him , but Row was indeed more merciful . Gibson . These are the Stockings , which they took out of my House White . I bought them of Ward and Row . Bird . Ward and Row were together when they were bought ; the Prisoner swore that Ward had bought them in Drury-Lane , for a Crown . Gibson . I have another Man now in Custody at Dublin , when he is brought over , I do n't know how Hampton may appear . Ward put him in his Information . Row Guilty . Death . Hampton Acquitted . 14. Thomas Hornbrook , was indicted for stealing a Gelding of a wan Colour , value 3 l . the Goods of Thomas Merry , August the 10th . Thomas Merry . My Horse was in the Church-yard of Yalling in the County of Huntingdon , on Friday Night , August the 6th , on the 7th in the Morning he was gone . I had him cry 'd at St. Ives , and 2 or 3 other Places , and at last this next Witness Mr. Unwin gave me Information of him . Mr. Unwin . I live in Well-street , near Well-Close-Square . The Prisoner came to me the Sunday after the Horse was lost , about 3 or 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon , and told me he had got 2 Horses , but as one was enough for his Business , he would dispose of the other . One of them was sit for a Saddle or a Chaise : I said , I wanted such a one , and he brought this wan Gelding to me on the Tuesday following , and told me he was worth 5 or 6 Guineas ; but if I would buy him , I should have him at any Price . The Horse was in very bad Condition , when I saw him : and I suspected he was not honestly come by . He call 'd for Bread and Cheese , and sent me out for some Onions ; instead of going for Onions , I got a Constable and had them before Justice Farmer : the Prisoner had a Boy with him , whom I took up too , and he gave me the Information . Cox , the Boy . The Prisoner and I had swept the Prosecutor 's Chimney , and when we had done , he came to me and fell a Laughing ; I asked what he laughed at ; why says he , here is a Saddle and Bridle , and there 's a Horse in the Church-yard , we 'll come at Night and take them away , and go to London . We came about 12 o'Clock , he took the Bridle and Pannel out of the Stable ; I held open the Gate ; he rode the Horse out , and we both came away together . Guilty , Death . 13. Thomas Morris , was indicted for Assaulting John Green , June the 30th , and giving him with both his Hands , divers mortal Bruises on his Head , Breast , Back , Stomach and Sides ; by Reason of which said mortal Bruises , he the said Green did languish , and languishingly liv 'd from the said 30th of June , to the 16th of July , at which time he dyed . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest , for feloniously slaying the said Green . Mr. Hathwell , Surgeon . I saw him a fortnight before he dy 'd : There was a Bruise on his Breast , and several on other Parts of his Body ; which with a Pleuretic Fever , was the Occasion of his Death . Hannah Green . I am his Widow : He dy 'd the 16th of July . On the Thursday seennight before he dy 'd , he came home from work , in a bed Condition : He was a Plaisterer , and had been at work at Mile-end . On the Monday morning before , he went out in perfect health ; but that Thursday night , he was very ill ; I asked him what was the matter : He said he had received a Hurt on his Side by a Blow , but would not tell me in what manner he received the Hurt : He desired me to let him alone , and said , he would tell me afterwards how it came . I sent for a Surgeon to bleed him about 7 o'Clock that Night ; but he continu 'd very ill , and in the Morning he told me , if the Pain he was in continu 'd , it would kill him : It will make you uneasy if I tell you , how I have been hurt ; but if ever I get well , I will right myself . On Sunday night he told me that 2 of their Men had been gaming ; that one having lost his Shirt , he pull 'd off his , to lend the Looser : Tom Morris was the Man , he said , he lent his Shirt to ; who refusing to let him have it again , they quarrell 'd , and Morris had given the Blows . On Monday I sent to Mr. Bransbury the Apothecary , and he order 'd him to be blooded ; on Tuesday , he was blooded again , and grew so bad , that he could not lye down in his Bed ; but constantly complained of a Pain in his Side . My Dear , says I ( the Day he dyed , ) do you think the Blow Morris gave you , is the Occasion of your Death ? Yes , say 'd he . I asked him if I should follow the Law ? Do what you please says he , he deserves it ; but I forgive him , as I hope to be forgiven . Mr. Bransbury . I was sent for on Monday , and found the Deceased complaining of a Pain in his Side , and Shortness of Breath . He seemed very uneasy : I asked if he spit Blood , or made bloody Urine ; he said no ; he was blooded twice : after which he was easier ; but in a Day or two , his Pain return 'd , and he could not lie down for the Shortness of his Breath . I apprehended it to be a Decay in his Constitution . As for the Bruises , I saw none , nor did he complain of any to me . Surgeon . I can not take on me to say , that any of the Bruises were mortal . Mr. Bransbury . I apprehend there was an Adhesion of the Lungs , and that it was a consumptive Case . I asked him if he had not drank hard , particularly , if he had not been us 'd to drink Drams ; and he said , formerly he had , but he had left them off now . Q . If the Bruises had occasion 'd some inward mortal Disorder , would there not have been some Symptoms of the Disorder , as bloody Urine , spitting of Blood , or the like ? Surgeon . I should think so . Robert Millaway . The Deceased and the Prisoner , about 3 Weeks before his Death , were playing at Skettles : I came in and play 'd with them , the Prisoner lost his Wastcoat , and would play for his Shirt with another Man : the Deceased said he would lend his Shirt to the Man who lost : the Prisoner losing , asked the Deceased for his Shirt ; he pull 'd it off and lent it him ; but I suppose growing a little coldish without his Shirt , he asked the Prisoner for it again , who would not give it him , till he had got another : then they went into the House , drank together , and quarrelling push 'd one another against the Table , broke a Pane of Glass , and then sat down again ; but the Deceas 'd insisting on having his Shirt again , said he would fight him for it , and out they went , but did not strike above 6 Blows ; nor did I observe that the Deceas 'd had Blows of any Consequence : he said he had enough , and the Prisoner gave over : after this they sat and drank together upon the Bench . Mr. Cary . About a Week before he dy 'd , he look 'd yellow and bad , I asked him how he did ; and he told me , he had fallen from a Scaffold , and that a Piece of Wood 15 Foot long , call 'd a Ledger fell on him , and had bruis 'd him so much , that he could hardly breath : this was about a Week before he dy 'd . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and found that John Green dy 'd of a Consumption . 15.

John Thomas owned he had robb 'd Stevens of 3 Watches , and that the 2 Women had receiv 'd them , tho ' they knew he had stole them . One Watch was pawn 'd at Barrets , which I fetched out ; this is the very same . Stevens . This is my Watch . Barret . Finney , and another Woman pawned this Watch to me for a Guinea and a half . Constable . Another Watch was pawned at Haydon 's in the Strand . Anne Finney went with me to fetch them out of pawn . John Thomas told them they knew they were stole . Anne Hawkins . Finney came to me , and said she was very poor , and every body would not care to take in what she had got to pledge , so she desired me to go with her to a Pawnbrokers ; I carry 'd her to Barret 's , and on my Account Barret lent her a Guinea and a half : she said it was for a Friend of hers in Trouble . Elizabeth Scott . Finney and Shropshire call 'd me down from my 3 Infants , and desired me to pawn a Watch for them ; I carry 'd them to Haydon 's , but they would not take it in ; then I went to this young Man 's Master , and he lent 12 s. on it : I gave them the Money , and had 6 d. for my Trouble . Pawnbroker 's Boy . July the 21st , this Woman ( Scott ) brought the Watch to our House , and had 12 s. upon it . Scott . But they were both at the Door when I went in . This is the very Watch I pawn 'd . Stevens . This I swear to be mine ; and these Watches were hung in a Glass-Case in my Shop . Brown , Constable . Thomas told me when I examin 'd him , that he pull 'd the Case open one time ; another time he saw the Key hang by it , and so he open 'd it . I asked him why he did not take Gold Watches ; he said he did take one down , but his Heart misgave him ; so he put it up again and took a silver one . John Thomas Guilty , Death .

July the 31st , I was coming from Horton in Buckinghamshire ; at Beggars-bush , between Acton and Kensington , there is a Bridge , and by that Bridge there is a Dunghill and a Gate . On the middle of the Bridge I met a Man upon a black Horse : I was attack 'd by him and another who came up to him ; they had each of them a Pistol in their left Hands , and a Truncheon in their right . They made me dismount , and carry 'd me over the Gate , into a Field , then put me into a Ditch and searched my Pockets : They took away the Things mention 'd in the Indictment , and which I swear to . They gagg 'd me and stripp 'd me quite naked ; my Hands were ty 'd behind me , my left Leg fasten 'd up to my Hands , and my right Leg lash 'd to the other : Then they drew me out of the Ditch into a Furrow , where I lay 'till 12 o'Clock at Night , when a Man coming by released me . I am positive to the 2 Prisoners , for it was light enough to see their Faces ; I heard nothing of them , 'till they were taken up for robbing Mr. Hawkins , 3 Days afterwards ; then I went to see them , and knew them to be the Men that robb 'd me . Barns . Dwyer was taken up on suspicion of robbing Mr. Hawkins , and to save himself he desired before Mr. De Viel to be made an Evidence . I was in pursuit of O Neal when my Beadle stopp 'd him ; and he too desired to be made an Evidence : I have got the Slugs which I drew out of O Neal 's Pistols , which we took from him . Daniel Hawkins . On Tuesday the 3d of last Month , I was robb 'd by the 2 Men at the Barr , about a quarter of a Mile from Stone-bridge , on the Harrow road , about 9 o'Clock at Night . O Neal catch 'd hold of my Horse and led him into Mr. Newman 's Ground , and Dwyer lay 'd hold of me , and led me about 20 Poles length into the Field . Under a Hedge they laid me down ; O Neal took 7 Guineas and some Silver from me , and cut off my Silver Buttons ; they cut my Coat and Wastcoat down , and took Cloth and Buttons together , and the Buckles out of my Shoes : When they had robbed me , I was going to get up , but Dwyer struck me with his Stick , and say 'd , they had not done with me ; then O Neal pulled a Handkerchief out of his Pocket , and ty 'd my Hands behind me ; but before he had done , Dwyer got upon my Horse and rode away with him . O Neal bid me lye still , for he should bring me more Company presently . Mr. Newman met them both upon my black Horse as they were riding off ; they rid as far as they thought proper , then turn 'd up my Horse , and I found him again . Constable . I took these Buckles upon O Neal . Hawkins . These are the Buckles they took from me . I heard nothing of the Men 'till Thursday , when a Man came from Turnham green and told me a Man was taken there , with such Goods as I had lost upon him ; I went and saw O Neal there , and had him before a Justice . Newman . I came from Paddington with Mr. Hawkins : We drank together at Halsden-green ; and he went away about half an Hour before me . As I came home , I met 2 Men upon his Horse , within a quarter of a Mile from the Place where he was robb 'd , I knew the Horse very well ; and O Neal rid hindmost . The next Morning I heard that Mr. Hawkins had been robb 'd in my Field , and there my Maid found his Whip : We printed Bills for the Horse ; Dwyer was taken and confess 'd in hopes of being made an Evidence . Joseph Green . The 2 Prisoners lodged in my House in James 's street , near Grosvener square . They told me they dealt in Lace and Holland , and carry 'd Packs about the Country . They lodged about 9 Days with me , and in that Time they lay out 4 Nights , and the last Time 2 Nights successively : Once when they came home they quarrell 'd and fought about sharing some Money , and a loaded Pistol was found in their Bed : My People told me of that , and I went for a Constable to charge them on suspicion ; but the Constable would not come without a Warrant ; I could not find a Justice at home , so I came back to my House , and found the 2 Men were gone ; but Dwyer coming to a Pawnbrokers to redeem a Coat , he was taken up on suspicion of being a Highwayman . John Stokes . I carry 'd Dwyer before Justice De Viel , who examin 'd him two several Times ; at last he confess 'd that O Neal and he had robb 'd near Brentford . I went to Brentford and found out Mr. Hawkins : O Neal was now taken , and when Hawkins saw them both , he knew them . Dwyer made him a Bow , and asked him if he had used him ill or hurt him : The silver Buttons were found upon Dwyer , and the Buckles upon O Neal , before the Justice . Dwyer . I ca n't tell what to say to it . O Neal . 'T is a Folly for me to say any Thing ; I am in a Fever and can not dispute . Both guilty of the Indictment . Death . 18.

I keep a Green Grocers Cellar , under the Rose-Tavern in Russel-street , Covent-Garden . On the 11th of July , going from my own Cellar , I met the Prisoner within 3 Yards of the Door : I look 'd full in his Face by the Light of the Lamps : he pass 'd me ; but return 'd and knock 'd me down : as I was getting up , I found his Hand in my right Side Pocket : the Mob gather 'd about me , and the Watch was called , but before they came , he knock 'd me down again , and ran away : the Watchmen ran after him ; I could not run so fast as they , but I heard him say , for I was within 30 Yards of him , the first Man that comes after me , I 'll mow him down like Grass . I can swear to the Man , and that he knock 'd me down 3 Yards from my own Cellar-Door . Edward Shorter , Watchman . Between 10 and a 11 at Night , I was going ( according to Custom ) for my Half-penny worth of Tobacco , I saw the Prisoner knock Chinnick down ; Watch was call 'd , and away he ran : they ran after him to the End of Russel-street , and would go no farther ; I heard him say , the first Man that came after him , he would mow down like Grass . Q . This was done very quick : the Watch , and Company came about you , yet your Money was snap 'd out of your Pocket , and you was knock 'd down again you say ; would it not have been natural for a Man to have said he was robb 'd then ? Chinnick . I do n't swear the Man had my Money : I lost so much Money , and I felt his Hand in my Pocket . Q . When was the Prisoner taken ? Chinnick . About 7 Weeks after . Prisoner .

Robert Doleman . On Sunday the 18th of July , I went to my Chest of Drawers ( I lodge in Brown 's House ) and found them lock 'd : but upon opening them , I found my Bag empty ; 14 Guineas and 4 s. were gone . So I went into the Kitchen to my Landlady ( for her Husband was abroad ) and I enquired who had been in my Room ? She said no body : some body must have been there says I , for my Money is gone . She call 'd up her Apprentice Duree , and her Son John , but they both deny 'd the Matter . I went to Church , and when I came home again , my Landlord was come in : I asked him for Mark Duree ; he said , he had given him leave to go out : And he never came home that Night , but rak 'd about for a Week or 10 Days , and got a board a Ship , at Sheerness , with a Chimney Sweeper . The Chimney Sweeper 's Brother found them out , and got them back to London . I desired Mark 's Mother who secreted him , to permit me to see him : She said I should see him , if I would come without a Constable , and the Place appointed was the Black-horse in Nightingale Lane . I met the Mother there , and she took me from thence to a Millener 's shop , and there I saw him , and charg 'd him with taking my Money . He own 'd all the matter : That he had taken out sometimes 1 Guinea ; sometimes 2 or 3 , and that his Master 's Son was with him , and that they had follow 'd this Practice for 6 Weeks together , and always open 'd the Drawer with my own Key . On the 5th of August , I had the Happiness to see him again , I had my Lord-Mayor 's Warrant out , and took him up : He was carry 'd before Sir Richard Brocas ; there he made a Confession , which was taken in writing ; and after it had been read over to him , he voluntarily sign 'd it . The Confession was prov 'd , but it being on Oath , could not be read in Evidence against him . Prisoner . When I made the Confession , he promised he would not hurt a Hair on my Head . William Wood . When the Prisoner was taken up the 5th of August , he own 'd he had taken at several Times 2 or 3 Guineas , his Master 's Son being with him : That they always took it by turns , who should watch , and who should take the Money ; they did not go the first Time to look for Money , but for some of Doleman 's Brandy , and seeing where the Keys of his Drawers was put , they took the Money . James Fitzgerald . I have a Brother who is Apprentice to a Chimney Sweeper on St. Dunstan 's Hill ; he and the Prisoner ran away to Sheerness , where I found them both , and perswaded them both to come back to London ; Duree own 'd that he and his Master 's Son took Doleman 's Money . Esther Duree . My Child is unfortunate , in falling into bad Hands . But as to the Case before your lordship , Doleman obliged me to bring this Boy into a Confession , and faithfully promised he would not bring him to Justice ; I am a Woman alone , and have not a Friend to appear for me , my Husband being at present under a Cloud . He promised not to prosecute him , if he could find that Brown 's Boy or his Wife were concerned . James Duree , depos 'd to the same Effect . John Lapine . The last time Mrs. Duree brought her Son Mark to the Prosecutor , he promis 'd not to hurt him : Come in says he to him , I wo n't hurt you , but when he had got him into the House a Constable came and took him .

The Linnen which is lost , was a Gentleman 's who lodged and boarded with me : He left it in my House , nail 'd up in a Box , and he 's since dead at Barbadoes . His Name was Alexander Steadman ; but the Goods are now the Property of James Rule , an Executor of Steadman 's , and he comes on me for the same .

Samuel Hasswell . I was going out of Town in my Chariot , July 23. and a little on this side Tottenham-Cross , the Coachman turn 'd out of the great Road to go down the green Lane : he had not drove above a Mile , before 2 Men came up to the Chariot , with their Faces cover 'd , and Pistols in their Hands , and bid him stop : they demanded my Money , and I gave them the Money and Things mentioned in the Indictment : this was between 1 and 2 o'Clock at noon . I ca n't swear to the Prisoner , for both their Faces were cover 'd with something brown , in which there were Holes for their Eyes and Nose . I saw only the lower Part of their Faces . My Watch was found on Wager , but he is not taken . Philip Wilson . I drove Mr.Hasswell the 23d of July , and looked back 6 or 8 Times , as they follow 'd the Chariot . I saw their Face as plain as I see the Prisoners now , and several Times , before they put their Masks on . I took them to be 2 Persons going home . and expected no Robbery . Several times I observed their Faces , and I swear that the Prisoner is one of them , for I took notice of his Voice , as well as his Face ; he speaks thick and hastily . The Prisoner was the Man who came up and swore he would shoot me , if I did not stop ; I up with my Whip , and was going to strike him , but I did not ; and the third time of his swearing at me . I stop 'd : then he turn 'd about and demanded Mr. Hasswell 's Money : the other Man was at this time putting on his Mask behind the Chariot , and the Prisoner cry 'd d - n ye , d - n ye , come up to the other Side , shall we see what the Coachman has got , because he would not stop the first time we bid him Wager bid me look forward , and Bonner say 'd , why do n't you see what the Coachman has got ; says Wager , the Coachman does look forward : I heard him ( Wager ) say , D - n you , where is your Watch , and I saw the Watch delivered into his Hand , and Bonner took the Money and the Ring , and Wager had the Watch . Then they left us and went 2 or 300 Yards towards the Turnpike in the green Lane . We told the People there and Bonner came after us , and called out , D - n his Blood where is the Coachman , Why do n't he go about his Business . There was 2 or 3 Men in the back Yard , and I asked them for a Gun : I got one , and Bonner cry 'd out to me , Why do n't you go on ? I clapp 'd the Gun to my Shoulder , presented the Peice , and cry 'd out , Now I have you . Bonner then fell from his Horse , but got up again , and made clear off ; but was afterwards taken by some People who knew he had haunted these Lanes for some Days , and knew both him and Wager to be such sort of Men . Bonner . I ask if he knows Wager ? Wilson . I believe I should . Bonner . He said in his Affidavit before Sir Richard Brocas , that he never saw him , ( Wager ) in his Life . Wilson . I made no Affidavit at all concerning Wager . Bonner . How does he know his Name to be Wager ? Wilson . I do n't know his Name but by intelligence : they call him Cocky . The Constable . I serv 'd the Warrant upon Bonner , I knew he was a desperate Fellow , so I got 2 or 3 to assist me . I took him at the Black-Spread-Eagle Alehouse in Pater noster-Row , on the Information of the Coachman , in a dark Room , and 2 or 3 Women were with him : we took him to Sir Richard Brocas 's , but he not being ready , we had him to the Bull-head , till the Alderman could give us a hearing : he seem 'd very uneasy , and I was uneasy too ; while we were there , a lusty Carpenter one of his Associates , and 2 or 3 more came in , and Bonner said to them , `` have you `` brought Pistols and Hangers ? If you have , `` fall to , fire , and away : '' however , I got Bonner to Sir Richard 's first , and because we cou 'd not get the People there , he was to be re-examin 'd ; and when we got the Coachman and him together , that they might see one another , the Coachman said , `` out of a thousand that is the `` Man , I remember his quick Speech . '' Bonner was in his Butcher 's Livery , and he asked the Coachman if he knew him : Aye , says the Coachman , if I had never seen you , I should have had no Trouble with you then he described Wager ; and Cocky is the most remarkable Man in the World . Francis Waker . The Constable came to me , and told me he had an Information against Bonner , as he was a desperate Fellow , he desired me to assist him ; we got 5 in all , and at the Blackspread-Eagle in Paternoster-Row we took him , and carry 'd him to the Bull-Head ; we had not been there a quarter of an Hour , but up comes 3 or 4 Men , one of them , a very lusty sturdy Fellow ; he went up and spoke to Bonner , he ask 'd if they had got Pistols and Hangers , if they had , they must fall to , fire and away ; for fear of a Rescue , we got him down to the Alderman 's , and he committed him to the Compter for a farther Hearing . Bonner . I was drinking at the Black-spread-Eagle , with Cocky Wager 's Sister ; there were Warrants out to take him up , and I was contriving with her how to get him off ; and as he and I were intimate . I thought I should be taken up as well as he : I advised Cocky 's Sister to get him out of the Nation . Call Mr. Well 's , Mrs. Well 's , Mr. Story , and Mr. Lyon ( who all appearing , were sworn ) - Wells . I live at Endfield wash , am a Butcher I came to Smithfield , - in June , - in July , aye in July it was ; I am no Scholar and please you , my Lord , - but I came to buy a Bullock : I brought it , and up comes Mr. Bonner , how do you do says he ?

I have Reason to remember the Day , because my Husband pay 'd Money that Day : and going home , I fell off my Horse , and did not go out of Doors for a Fortnight . Q . If your Husband pay 'd Money , did not he take a Receipt ? Susan Well . Yes , my Lord . Q . If Foiler is the Person he deals with did not you bring him here to prove that lock was bought at that time ? Susan Wells . We were not acquainted with the matter 'till Monday last , else we should have brought him . - Wells I paid the Money at the Grey-hound in Smithfield , and said there from 11 o'Clock to 4 or 5 . But I do n't know the Man 's Name that keeps the house . Q . You know the House where you say he was , Why did not you do the good Office to bring the Man , or some of his Tapsters here ? That is not so far as Essex . What Character does Bonner bear ? - Wells . A very good Character as far as I know : He keeps a Shop in Newgate Market , and I have sold him Pork and Veal in Carcasses ; I know nothing but that he is very honest . ( Here he produced Foiler 's Receipt ) Q . Who is this John Lyon , that witness 'd this Receipt . John Lyon . I am the Person .

I follow the same Business still ; and have acted in the Station of a Clerk to Merchants . I happen 'd to be accidentally in Smithfield when the Money was paid and I happen 'd to see Mr. Bonner there . These People I know nothing of . Mr. Bonner asked me to drink , and thro ' their Persuasions , I went with him to the Greyhound Mr. Bonner I have known those 20 Years . Wells can neither write nor read : it was at Bonner 's Request that I wrote the Receipt . Q . There 's no doubt but you did ; and 't is dated the 23d of July : Pray did you ever see Foiler before ? Lyon . No , never . I came about a 11 , and stay 'd till after 3 in the Afternoon . Q .

Can you recollect that any such Persons as these , were at your House the 23d of July ? Do you know one Foiler of Essex ? Broughton . No , but I can tell by my Books , whether such a one paid for a Bullock : I take the Money , and set it down in my Book , for the Grasiers : they do n't take the Money themselves ; I have my Book , at home , and the Man must tell me who he bought the Bullock of : I do n't remember that ever I saw these 4 People in my Life . Broughton 's Servant . I know nothing of any of them . I can not recollect that any Persons sat at our House that Day 4 or 5 Hours about selling a Bullock . Q . Do any of you know Foiler ? Broughton . No . Mr.Maynard . I have known the Prisoner 20 Years , he is a Butcher in Newgate Market , he has a bad Character , and is a reputed Highwayman .

( Here the Books from the Greyhound , and the Hostler were sent for . ) Mr. Maynard .

( Sunday Morning ) he knock 'd at the Door ; I had no body in the House then , but 2 Children about 8 or 9 Years old ; he was let in , and he went directly to my Bureau , call 'd me Bitch , and said if I took the Law of him , he would cut my Throat , or get 50 People to swear my Life away ; he then took away the Gold Watch , and the Diamond Ring , and a Bank Note of 40 l and 5 Shirts of the Orphans . Q . What Pretence did he make for this ? Sayer . None at all ; he took them violently . And on the 24th of April , he arrested me in an Action of 140 l. tho ' I never had seen a Farthing of his ; and while I was at the spunging House in Grocer 's Alley , my House was broke open , and all he Things mention 'd in the Indictment , were taken away . I could not prosecute him sooner , because I have been in Custody ; and when I had my Liberty , I heard he was gone to Holland . Councel . Pray did not you keep a publick Coffee House ; and did not the Prisoner , and you live together as Man and Wife ? did not you both receive Money of your Customers ? Sayer . No : he was only my Lodger ; I kept the House in my own Name . Councel . At whose Expence was the Coffee House fitted up ? Did not he pay the Money ? Sayer . He did pay a Man in the Name , and for the Use of Elizabeth Sayer . I always gave him the Money , he never paid any Money of his own for me . Councel . I ask you if he did not pass for your Husband ? Sayer . No , never . He had a Wife in Sheer Lane . Councel . Why did he lodge at your House then ? Sayer . He took a Room to screen his Goods , and he would lodge there himself , as it was his own Lodging . Councel . I ask whether this Quarrel did not arise from his reprimanding you about your Daughter 's keeping Company ? Prisoner . She sold her Daughter 's Maiden-head to one Major Lewis of Deptford for 100 l. he is since a Bankrupt , and she got none of the Money . She pawn 'd a silver Spoon of mine to buy a pair of Sheets , she pawn 'd even her own Looking Glasses . She says she did not know where to find me before ; but my Lord , she was on the back of a Bill last Sessions as a Witnes against me for a Conspiracy against one Drinkwater , and this Drinkwater has charged my Wife ( while she was attending on me here ) with a Robbery , and she is taken into Custody by one Hicks an Officer . Drinkwater . In the Year 1734 , I was Servant for about 6 Months to the Prisoner as a Drawer . - Hicks the Constable was call 'd . Q . Who gave you the Warrant to take this Woman into Custody , while she was attending her Husband . Hicks . This Man was one : There was 2 Men and 2 Women with him . Warwick 's Wife . I saw Drinkwater give it the Constable , and then he took hold of my Arm . Drinkwater . I was Drawer at Warwick 's House in Sheer Lane ; he kept a very Disorderly House . Sayer came to him to advise with him about her Administring , and he advised her to make a forged Will , and asked me if I had a Will of any bodies , to make it by : but I would not be concerned . Afterwards he said , one Day , G - d d - n this silly Bitch , she has got Money , I must contrive to get it from her ; I will get a Lodging in her House , make her drunk , and so get it from her ; Good by Molly , says he to his Wife , I must go from you for 6 Months , to get the tall Man 's Effects from the Bitch . What will you do with the Children say 'd she : I 'll send them to Sea , says he , so the Prisoner and his Wife parted , that he might rob the Woman . ( The Court order 'd Drinkwater into Custody , for taking his Wife while she was attending her Husband 's Business in the Court ; and the Constable was reprimanded . ) James Smith . When my Mother was out , Joyce and Warwick came to the Door Joyce open 'd the Cellar Door and got into the House , and let Warwick in ; then they got Porters and carry 'd off all the Goods , in Baskets and Sheets . Prisoner . Ask the Boy if he has not seen me in bed with this Woman ? Smith . No , Sir . He had Goods of his own in the House once ; but they had been seized and were gone before this . Mary Wilson . I saw Warwick packing up the Goods , and taking off the Lock from Sayer 's Street Door ; I ca n't tell how they liv 'd together ; nor have I ever heard they were Man and Wife . Q . He had a Wife else where , but he lodged at her House . 'T is a very scandalous Story . Pray what Pretence had you to take the Watch , the Ring , and the Shirts of Alexander Miller 's ? Warwick . I can produce the Man that made the Diamond Ring , and all the Rings she had : the other Goods were my own : the Sheriff seized them on an Extent ; a Man bought them afterwards of the Sheriff . Here is the Bill of Sale , and I bought them again of him . Mr. Cook . I heard Drinkwater say , his Head and Pen were at work to get Jack Warwick hanged or transported . I know he and Sayer liv 'd together as Man and Wife . He call 'd her my Dear , and she call 'd him so : nay , she has shewn me the bed , that her Johnny and she lay in . I saw some Diamonds they had to sell , and says she to him , Johnny as we ca n't sell them , you shall have a Ring , and I 'll have a Ring , and the Girl shall have a Ring ; it was he alter 'd the House , and paid several Workmen . Mr. Martin . I was told that Warwick had Goods in this House , and that the Sheriff 's Officers had seiz 'd them , as his . I found it was so , and I bought them again of the Sheriff 's Officers for my self ; but Warwick applying to me for them , I sold them to him again for the same Money I had paid , so the Goods were never carry 'd away . Warwick . Ask if I did not pay 3 Guineas for the Ring ? William Martin . I was a Stranger to Warwick before he brought the Action against this Woman . I took her then to be an honest , industrious Woman ; however , she has order 'd it since . When she was in the spunging House , she sent for me ; I told her I would see Warwick . and know his Demands . He told me he had disbursed Money on her Account , and would release her , if she would pay some Debts on Account of the House , which amounted to 11 or 12 l. She offer 'd me the Lease of her House for Security , if I would pay this Money ; I paid the Money , and had the Key of the House to take Possession ; she desired me to take care of her Goods , and I went accordingly to the House , supposing I should find it lock 'd up , but I found Warwick there , and he told me he got in at the Cellar Window ; the Goods were taken down ; some were carry 'd away before I came , and some , while I was in the House . Warwick told me then , he had the Woman 's Authority for what he did , and that he was to take care of the Goods . There were some Things in the House , not proper to be broke down ; he would do it , and rather than I would dispute with a Man of his Reputation . I paid him 48 s. to prevent it . John Thompson . I carry 'd Warwick and Sayer by Water , to see a Horse he had at Grass : after they were got home , they sent to know if a Case of a Watch was not left in the Boat ; I searched , and sent word I could not find it , after this , her Daughter came to me , and said , Mr. Warwick was very kind to her Mother , and bid her not fret about it , for she should wear her 's ( the Daughter 's ) 'till he gave her another . Another Witness . I was at Warwick 's House in St. Clement 's Church Yard , 2 Years ago about altering a Watch , and the Woman said , when it was done , it would make her Jackey a good Watch . Q . Is there any one will give you a good Character : you give your self a very bad one ? - Sidley . I have dealt with Warwick , and he paid me for what he had . I never knew he was a Thief before .

Then I went to bed , and one of the Women came to bed to me , tho ' I would not let her : The oldest of the Prisoners pull 'd up her Coats , and bid me look at - and told me it was as black as my Face , & c. & c. - I would not do it , but went to sleep , and when I waked I found all my Money gone . One of the Girls own 'd before Justice Farmer , that 8 Guineas and 4 s. of my Money was divided among them . Prisoner Smith . Did not you swear your Money on another Woman ? Guy . Why Mary you know , you took my Breeches from under my Head . George Fulham . These 2 Creatures own 'd before the Justice , that they had divided 8 Guineas and 4s . and that Whitcher had the best part of it . Jones said in New Prison , if we would let her out , she would tell who had most of the Black 's Money . Nathaniel Harris and Jeremiah Lester , deposed to the same Effect .

William Orr . My Lord , and you Gentlemen of the Jury ( Reading ) I committed the Thing to writing , that I might not forget any Thing material , nor trouble the Court with any Thing that was trifling . This I did when the Thing happen 'd . Q . 'T is not usual Sir to read a Testimony ; you may use your Papers to refresh your Memory , but it has always been the Custom for Witnesses to give their Evidence , Viva Voce . Orr . My Lord , I will endeavour to do it . August the 4th at Night , I came to the Hamburgh Coffee House in Drury Lane . I lost a silver Watch value 4l . After a pretty long Walk , coming to my Lodgings in Clare Court , near Covent Garden , at this Coffee House I call 'd , not knowing the Character of the House . I stay 'd there to refresh my self , and had a little Punch . I paid my Reckoning , was coming away , but being a little grip 'd . I call 'd for a small Dram . ( Reading . ) I committed my Thoughts to writing , having time to do it , and am better able to express them in that Light ; and I humbly conceive ( my Lord ) it will set the matter clearer . I put my Hat and Watch upon a Chair , in the Room where I was sitting . Q . Was it a publick Room ? Orr . It was a publick Room : The following Part of my Declaration , will shew both where it was , and how . Being a little grip 'd , I call 'd for a small Dram , and then a Girl came up . Q . Did not you say you was in the Publick Room ? Orr . It was a publick Coffee House , I made no scruple of going up Stairs , because I 've known such Houses to have Rooms above , for reading News , and private Letters . I was in a private Room ; tho ' I do n't know but all the Rooms are publick in some sort . On calling for a Dram , the Prisoner came up Stairs , I bid her make haste , and fetch it to me . My Watch and Hat were lying by me then upon the Chair between me and the Door . The Girl took up my Watch , and run down Stairs ; immediately I follow 'd her , and took hold of her at the Foot of the Stairs , and demanded my Watch . She desired Money before she 'd give it me ; first half a Guinea , then a Crown , then Charity because she was poor . I judg 'd a Prison or a Workhouse fitter for her than that . There was no Bed in the Room , and I can assure you , on all the Principles of Honour , I called there thro ' Innocence and Ignorance . Ignorance with Regard to the House , and Innocence with Regard to myself : I called for my Watch , none answer 'd ; I contested with the Girl , in Order to have my Watch again . Carney was near her ; whether she deliver 'd it to him when I came down , or how it was convey 'd from her , I know not . That Night I thought it expedient for me to go away , but I came again next Morning . I desired the Mistress of the House to get my Watch again , or I would have a Warrant , and take them all up . She said she knew nothing of the Watch , or who the Person was ; but afterwards she own 'd the Man , her Servant ; the Girl an Attendant on some Occasions . I had a Warrant on Suspicion for the Woman of the House , but when the Constable came , not a Woman in the House was there . I came several Days after to find my Watch ; Carney , the now Prisoner at the Barr , said he would see , and help me to it , in a little Time . A Day or 2 after this , I came again , to see if he had any Notice of it . He said 't was pawn 'd for a Guinea and a half , and that with 18 d. would soon redeem it . I desired him to carry me to the Pawnbrokers , that I might be sure it was my own , then I 'd redeem it . He said then I might swear Felony against the Pawnbroker , and would not do it : saying , he would fetch it in 3 Minutes Time . This made me suspect he had a hand in detaining the Watch . He said he had seen the Girl , and she had put her self in better Order , and had bought Cloaths with the Money , commending her for her Industry . On this , my Lord , I brought the Constable to take the Mistress of the House , and Girl if found . I charg 'd the Constable with the Prisoners at the Barr , and carry 'd them to Justice Midford , and he on the Evidence given , thought proper to commit them . A few Days afterwards , the Watch was found at a Pawnbroker 's , pawn 'd in Carney 's Name for 6 s. I gave the Constable the Marks , by which with Certainty he might know , if it was mine : we found it so ; I went to see it , at Mary Barret 's . Upon the Back was stuck a Paper , Carney 6 s. This appears both by the Paper and their Books . The Girl , my Lord , was found and taken up by Warrant , and she own 'd , taking the Watch , in the manner now related . Captain Midford , the Constable , and others , knows she own 'd it . She fell upon her Knees and begg 'd she might not be sent to the same Prison with him , for fear he should knock her on the Head , for being an Evidence against him . Carney . Ask him upon his Oath if he did not leave the Watch with the Woman for 6 s. Orr . Upon my Oath I did not . Mary Barret . Carney brought the Watch to me for 6 s. and he desired me to take care of it , for that it had been left for that Sum , with the Person who sent him . Burroughs . He pick 'd me up in the Street , at the End of Princes Street in Drury Lane . Carney . Ask Mrs. Barret if she did not tell me , I might have a Guinea upon it , and whether I did not say , no , 't is left but for 6 s. and I must have no more upon it . Barret . Yes , 't is very true . Orr . Did not you ( to the Pawnbroker ) own , that he pawn 'd it at twice for 3 s. and 3 s. Barret . Yes . Orr . When did he pawn it ? Barret . I can not tell the Time . Orr . Was it Night or Day ? Barret . It was one Morning in August . Arnwood Hawkins . I went to serve the Warrant upon Burroughs , at the Coffee House , but when we came there the Girl was gone . I bid Mr. Orr charge me with the Fellow ; he did , and I carry 'd him before Justice Midford , and there he say 'd he knew nothing at all of it . I enquired of the Pawnbrokers in th ' Neighbourhood , and found it at Barret 's . The Woman of the House directed me to find Burroughs in Lincoln 's Inn Fields ; I took her and carry 'd her before the Justice ; there she own 'd that Carney took the Watch from her , and when she desired him to let the Gentleman have it again , he d - d her for a Bitch , and said he should not have it . Q . What is your Business , Sir ? Orr . I am a private Gentleman . Carney . Ask the Gentleman if he is not a Parson ? Orr . I do n't see that will affect the Cause at all ; I am a private Gentleman . Carney . A Clergyman may be a private Gentleman : I desire he may Answer ? Orr . I do n't conceive he has a Right to that : I have the same Right of Prosecution if I am , or am not . Q . He has a Right to enquire , and if he insists upon it , you must answer his Question , you hear Sir , what it is . Orr . I am not a Clergyman . I live in America : I have been here 3 Months , and this Fall I return to America again . Burroughs 's Defence . I was coming up Drury Lane about 9 o'Clock at Night , and at the Corner of Princes Street , that Man stopp 'd me , and ask 'd me , if I would drink a Glass of Wine : Thank ye , Sir , says I , so he carried me to the Hamburgh Coffee House in Drury Lane ; we went up Stairs ; and he called for a quartern of Brandy ; we staid there some Time , and then we called for a Bottle of Cyder : Then he told me if I would have some Concerns with him , he would make me a Present : After this he pull 'd out his Watch , and having no Money to pay the Reckoning , he gave me the Watch to pawn for 6 s. there being no Body else in the House , I gave Carney the Watch to pawn for him ; he went and brought 3 s. what do you bring this for ? says I , you should have brought 6 s. I thought , says he , you said 3 s. so I sent him back for 3 s. more ; he had 1 s. for Porterage , the rest of the Money was paid into the Gentleman 's Hand . And the very next Morning he came and demanded his Watch . Anne Cooley . I was standing at the Hamburgh Coffee House Door . and I saw the Prisoner ( Burroughs ) and the Prosecutor go into the House ; she call 'd for a Candle , and they both went up Stairs together . They call 'd for a Quartern of Brandy ; Mary Clark carry 'd it up ; then I went away : In about an Hour 's Time , I came again , and saw the Prosecutor talking to Mrs. Hill at the Barr , and they were both drinking Punch . Next Day he came for his Watch , and says he to Carney , Young Man do you know where the Girl lives , that I was in Company with last Night ? Carney said he did not know justly , but would endeavour to find her out ; I shall not mind ( says the Prosecutor ) giving her the Trifle of Money , but the Watch I value , and would not part with it for 20 l. Carney said he was sure the Girl would give him the Watch again , when she saw him . Q . Who are you ? ( To this Witness . ) Cooley . I keep the Bar at Hill 's Coffee House in Drury-Lane . Mrs. Hill is out of Business now , when she settles , I shall keep her Barr again . Mary Clark . I am Servant to Mrs. Lee at the Hamburgh Coffee House ; the Prosecutor and the Prisoner came in about 9 o'Clock : the Girl came in first , and the Prosecutor follow 'd her . He called for a Room : I took a Candle off the Barr , and li't them both up Stairs ; he call 'd for Wine , then a Gill of Brandy , I carry 'd it up my self , 't was Cherry Brandy : I came down , and in some little time the Bell was rung again ; I went up , and he spake for 18 d of Punch : I left them an Hour or better ; then he called for Cyder , and then a Gill of Brandy , then call 'd to pay , and the Reckoning was 3 s. and 6 d which he gave me . Then they both came down Stairs ; and my Mistress being gone to a Neighbour 's Mrs. Hill took care of the Barr , and the Prosecutor went up to the Barr , and spoke to her : they had a Tiff of Punch , and drank it at the Barr , Hill , Burroughs and the Prosecutor . Then Burroughs and he went up Stairs again , and they had 18 d of Punch again ; I carry 'd it up , and heard him ask Burroughs if she call 'd to stay with him all Night ? Yes , says she , if you 'll make me a Present , but not else . He said he would not desire any Woman 's Company for nothing : what he had was little , but he would make her amends some other Time : he pull 'd out 3 s. and 6 d. and some Half-pence , but the Girl did not care to oblige him for that : he had a silver Watch , ( he said ) which he would leave at the Barr , for half a Guinea ; the Prisoner told him the People there did not take Pawns , but said he might leave it with her for half a Guinea ; well ( says he ) I have a Friend hard by , will redeem it for me next Morning ; so I came down , and heard no more . In a little Time they both came down Stairs again : I went out , and saw no more of them that Night . Carney . Ask her whether she did not see the Prosecutor put the Watch into the Woman 's Hand to pawn that ? Clark . I was in the Room , when the Watch was in her Hand , but I ca n't swear he gave it her . She hold it publickly in her Hand , and after that , I saw it lie on the Table . Orr . Ask her ( lest she should play the Jesuit ) whether she saw the Watch in the Girl 's Hand , up Stairs or below . Clark . Up Stairs . Orr . Ask her whether I did not hold the Girl by the Coat , and demand my Watch ? Clark . I did not hear him demand it at all . Sarah Hill . On a Thursday Night , in the latter End of August , the Woman Prisoner , and the Prosecutor came into this Coffee House : the Woman first , and he follow 'd her immediately ; they both desired to be li't up Stairs ; Mary Clark li't them up , and they call 'd for Liquor , but I did not mind what : They staid an Hour , or an Hour and half : Then they call 'd for the Reckoning and paid it . The Woman of the House being sent for out , I look 'd after her Barr , and in a little Time , the Woman and he came down Stairs : He stopp 'd at the Barr , to speak with me : He asked me to drink a Glass , of Punch with him ; I said I would if he pleased , so he desired me to make it . He told me he was a Foreigner , a Crelian and asked me to drink a Dram , after the Punch ; we drank a Glass of Rack , and for Punch and Rack , he paid half a Guinea . He told me he had now but little Money left , but says he , I do n't live far off . I told him the Servant should call him a Coach . and told him London was a sad Place - if he had no Money : Madam says he , I will not have a Coach , nor will I go home : Tho ' I have not Money , I have Money 's worth , and if you 'll give me your Company to Night , I 'll leave my Watch with you , 'till next Day . I said , I never went with any Gentlemen farther than the Coffee Room , and never took Pawns on such Accounts ; he importuned me : Said he liked me better than the Girl , and if I would consent , he would give me Satisfaction : He begg 'd of me not to be so unkind ; but I refusing , he said , well , I must return to my former Girl : I left that to his Discretion , and up Stairs he carry 'd her again , and staid half Hour : Then the Prisoner came down a Step or two before him , and in the Coffee Room , he took hold of her and said he would have his Watch again : She said with all her Heart , if he would give her the half Guinea he had promis 'd her . He call 'd her Hussy and Slut , and said he would not stay with her all Night ; No matter that for says she ; you have had my Company , and shall be as good as your Word . He took fast hold of her Coats , and said she should not go . Well says she , if you wo n't stay with me all Night , give me a Crown . He would give her nothing , and would have his Watch too . I thought he would have torn the Cloaths off her Back . I asked him how he could use the poor Creature so unkindly , To have her Company and give her Nothing : Says I , if I had given you mine , I suppose you 'd have serv 'd me so . I threatned to call the Watch , so they both went out of the House together ; but , it seems , he let her go , and came back to the Woman of the House and insisted on her making good his Watch . After many Words he went away , and came again the next Day , or the Day following , and enquired after the Girl : I told him he look 'd like one that would take more care of his Conscience , than to charge her with Felony , when he had had her Company , and when he knew he had offer 'd it me upon the same Terms . He said he had been put in a right way , and if he had not his Watch again , he would swear a Robbery against us all . Orr . My Lord , I humbly conceive , as she can swear so well , that she will answer some Questions as well . Burroughs . Pray , Sir , did not you lye with me ? - Upon your Oath . Orr . Upon my Honour and my Oath , my Lord , I did not . Burroughs . My Lord he did , against a Chair . Orr . I touch 'd her no way on the Face of the Earth , except when I laid hold of her Petticoats ; and upon my Honour and Oath , I made no offers to Hill , nor did I drink any Punch at the Barr . ( To Hill ) was I drunk or sober , Madam ? Hill . I took you to be sober ; you talk 'd in the same serious manner , that you do now . Thomas Archer . I was at the Hamburgh Coffee House one Sunday Night , and this Gentleman came in and said he had left a Watch with a Girl for a Trifle ; what it was , or who she was , I could not tell ; but he said nothing of its being stolen : He desired Carney the Waiter to get it again , or find the Girl out , and he would make him any reasonable Satisfaction . Orr . My Lord , I have a Person to prove that upon the Difficulty of this Prosecution , they said the would produce People who should Rapp fast enough A Witness . I was talking to Barret about the Watch she had taken , and she said , I wish as well off on Account of that Watch . a with this ( Mr. Orr 's ) for I have heard some say , they could find People enough to R Barret . I said , I wish 'd I was as this 6 s. Watch . Burroughs Guilty , Felony only Carney Acquitted . [ Branding . See summary . ] 71 , 72.

Thomas Scott , Anto Pratt , Val Arnold , William Clarkson , Tho Abbot , Wm Street , English , Paul Hussey , Paul La'marie , Peter Amiot , Samuel Aveline , Paul Crispin , Tho Collard , Foreign . ( Interpreters were sworn for the Prisoner and Prosecutor . ) The Rev . Mr. Charles Brockwell . The unhappy Gentleman at the Barr , was recommended to me , on his first coming to England to learn English . I live at Chigwell in Essex . On Saturday the 28th of August , he was in London , and a Person came down to me , with a Letter without a Name , as from the Prisoner , for some Papers ; he told me he had got the Key of his Room ; but as there were Things of value in the Room , and no Name was to the Letter , I sent for a Neighbour , one Cotton , who keeps the Stage Coach , and we all went up ; the Messenger found the Paper , so we locked the Door and gave the Key to the Messenger ; this was Saturday Night ; and on Sunday Morning about 6 o'Clock , Major General Franks and Stephen Moreau , came down to search his Room for a Diamond Cross ; he broke open the Door , and they felt in the Pockets of the Cloths which lay in his Bed . I told them , there could be nothing there , for I had searched there last Night for some Papers , but ( I told them ) there were more Cloaths in the Press ; we open 'd it and searched a pair of Black Velvet Breeches , with Gold Buttons , and out of one of the Side Pockets , the Jewel was taken . Q . When did the Prisoner go to London from your House ? Brockwell . The Monday before ; he had been about a Week in London . Q . Had you searched those Breeches ( in which the Cross was found ) the Night before for the Papers ? Brockwell . I looked no farther than into the trunk , for the Messenger found the Paper he wanted taking within some Tape , the inside of the Lid . Q . Had you any Directions in the Letter , where the Papers were to be found ? Brockwell . No . Q . Was the Letter , the Prisoner 's own Hand writing ? Brockwell . I can not tell . ( The Prisoner own 'd it . ) Prisoner . I sent this Letter , in order to have a Bill of Exchange delivered me out of the Trunk , but the Paper the Messenger took , was only an Order for Post Horses . ( Clerk reads the Letter . ) At Chigwell , Essex , For Mr. Brockwell . I desire you to go into my Room , and give the Bearer the present Paper . Brockwell . I did not know what Paper it was , nor the Man neither ; but this being the first Paper I li't of , I read it to him , and he said , this is the Paper ; and away he went . He told me the Gentleman was under Misfortunes , and in the Gatehouse , and that Paper was to let the World know , who he was . He told me the Prisoner desired me to come up next Morning to bail him ; so I did not give the Man the Paper , but thought to carry it up my self : next Morning General Franks and Mr. Moreau finding the Jewel in his Breeches , prevented the Delivery of the Paper . Q . When did he wear those Breeches ? Brockwell . I do n't know ; he had such a variety of Cloath , that I can not remember . Prisoner . Has Mr. Brockwell ever observed any thing blameable in my Behaviour or Conduct ? Brockwell . No , never ; he always behav 'd like a Gentleman . Stephen Moreau . The Prisoner and Sir John de Miranda , both lodge in my House ; I hear in the Morning at Eight o'Clock the 26th of August , his Excellence complain he lose his Cross ; he speak very low to his Servant , but I hear : and I went to him , in his own Chamber , and I ask , when he saw it : he say the very Morning before : he tell me he saw it : just the Day before , the 25th , when I went to the Races at Barnet : I ask him , who was in the Chamber ? He say , none but Monsieur Latour . I ask , have you Suspicion , he took the Cross ? He say . I open my Bureau , he ask for a Paper there . I leave de Bureau open , and go into mine Chamber to dress . When I came back , he ask me to walk in the Park ; Sir John tell me , between the Time he was gone to dress , Monsieur Latour take the Cross . So he go to General Frank , and tell this General Frank come at 10 o'Clock at Night , the 26th , and persuade his Excellence to take Warrant immediately : the General and his Excellence go to Justice Cotton , he grant a Warrant ; this was Friday Morning . The Prisoner went to Chigwell that Night , came home again on Saturday Morning . I ask him if he have been at Chigwell ? He tell me No . I find he changed Stockings , Breeches , Wastcoat and Wig . I ask him if he have Cloaths in the City , and he tell me , yes . Q . What Cloaths had he on when he went to Chigwell ? Moreau . Green Coat , Flannel Wastcoat , Velvet Breeches , and gold Buttons : this he had on when he go from my House the Friday Night , 5 o'Clock , and he come home in plain Breeches , no gold Buttons . Q . To Mr. Brockwell . Did he come to your House at Chigwell on Friday Night ? Brockwell , I was not at home , but I heard he had been there . Q . To Moreau . Did you see him on Saturday Morning with plain Breeches ? Moreau . Yes ; before I go to the Races , he come home , between 9 and 10 in the Morning . Q . How came you to take such particular notice of his Breeches ? Moreau . He come home , with the same Coat , not the same Wastcoat , and different : Breeches ; I ask him whether he have been at Chigwell ? He tell me no ; but then he take me into the Yard , and say to me , I have been at Chigwell , you not say any Thing of it ; and he give me 3 l. 12 s. to change ; I sent to change it , and he pay me some Money , he owe in the House . I am ver ' sure they were plain Breeches , and they was tore between the Legs . the Breeches he had on before was not tore . I say nothing to him , because General Frank and his Excellence was gone to the Councellor , to take him up . At Night my Wife tell me , he was took up , in the Gatehouse ; I go to him , and come home , and tell the General ; he go to Chigwell , but he say , Moreau , you say nothing of that ; so General Frank have a search Warrant to search his Cloaths at Chigwell ; ( before the Justice , he deny he was there , ) and his Excellence being weak , not go himself , but desire me to go with the General ; we had search Warrant back 'd by Justice Gold , and we come to this Gentleman 's House , at 6 Sunday Morning ; he tell us the Messenger was gone , and not take the Paper , and he shew us the Paper , and it was only about Post-Horses from Calais , and his Name not in the Paper . We desire Mr. Brockwell when he come at 6 o'Clock Sunday Morning , to let his Room be search ; so he broke open the Door with a Hammer , and when we come in , he say , all these Cloaths I search yesterday for the Paper ; and by and by we come to the Press , the Parson take the Breeches from the Press , and he throw 'd them on the Bed ; these are the Breeches , I say , and I feel about , in this manner , and put my Hand so , - and I feel something , and I say here is something , and I put my Hand in the Pocket , and take out the Cross - just so - a few Days after he was in the Gatehouse , he sent an Attorney , to ask for one Bill of Exchange that was in his Pocket ; I say , the Gentleman is mistake ; the Gentleman , the Attorney , he say , it was in the Breeches , so we look in the Breeches , and we find this Paper , a Bill for 70 l. Brockwell . I know nothing of this ; they took the Breeches , and the Cross away with them . Sir John Guider de Miranda . I went to shift my self ( I can not name the Day ) and left the Prisoner in the Room . I remember I took a Paper out of the Bureau , and left the Key in it ; the next Day I missed the Cross ; I went with General Franks to an Attorney , got a Warrant , and found it in the Prisoner 's Pocket . Prisoner . Did not Moreau , and his Servants frequently came in your Chamber ? Sir John . No . I apprehend no one could go into this Room but the Prisoner . Prisoner . How long was it left open ? Sir John . Only while I went into another Room to shift me . Another Witness . I was in the Country the Night Latour came down ; he came on Horseback , without Boots ; about 7 or 8 o'clock , he sat down to Supper , but seemed very pensive , and did not eat ; he said he came for a Bill of Exchange , and next Morning he rid to London . I took no notice of his Breeches but he came down in whitish Stockings , and next Morning went up in dark Gray . I was present when the Cross was took out of his Pocket ; and the Account that has been given , is exactly true . Q . ( To Brockwell ) Did you , or this last Witness lay Hands on the Breeches , and feel them before Moreau ? Brockwell . No ; no one felt them but he . Q . Was your Eye fixed on them from the Time you handed them to the Bed , 'till Moreau took the Cross out ? Brockwell . I think it was . Q . Do you think it was not possible for any thing to be put into the Breeches ? Brockwell . I can not answer that ; I have seen many things done by Legerdemain . Q . Did the Gentleman want Money then ? Brockwell . I believe he did ; for he had been 3 Months at my House ; and when I asked him for Money , he had none . The Prisoner gave a long Account of his first coming to England , and that his Acquaintance with Sir John began in Moreau 's House , where they both lodged ; that the Morning the Cross was lost , there was a Master of Languages in the Room with them ; and when he opened his Cabinet to take out the Paper , he said he would leave nothing in it , because Moreau was a Rogue , and had a false Key . Sir John denied this ; and being asked if he had any suspicion of Moreau , he said , no . Prisoner . Sir John has said so , in the Presence of a Man that lodges at Moreau 's , and who came with him this Morning to this Place . Moreau . I do not know the Man 's Name , nor where he is . Several Persons appeared to Moreau 's Character , as an honest Man . Prisoner . I was not left in the Room , but went with Sir John into his Dressing Room . Sir John dedenied this . The Reason the Prisoner gave for his Journey to Chigwell on Friday Night , was to satisfy Mr. Brockwell about Money due to him ; and he informed the Court , that he could not make a proper Defence , because he was brought unexpectedly to the Barr ; he having the Night before given 5 Guineas , a Gold Watch , 3 or 4 Embroidered Wastcoats to the Persons concerned in the Prosecution ; and a Bond with a Penalty of 300 l. to Sir John , to make up the Affair ( which Bond was produced and read in Court . ) He said , they told him , he need not provide any Counsel or any Attorney ; and farther informed the Court , that his Attorney had engaged Counsel in his Cause , but the Prosecutor sent notice to him last Night , that the Matter was compromis 'd , and that this was the Reason he had no body to appear for him . Mr. Compton . My Clerk told me , such notice was sent ; and I was much surprized when I found Mr. Latour was called to his Trial ; if I had known it , I should have feed Serj Haywood . I had Instructions to call a Person , who was to speak to Moreau 's having a false Key , if I had been prepared . Q . When was this Prisoner committed ? Keeper of the Gatehouse . The Commitment is dated August the 27th , which was on a Friday ; he came into my case the Night of the same Day , about 10 or 11 o'Clock . Q. Moreau swore he was at Chigwell that Night . Prisoner . 'T is a little odd , that they should not search my Boxes in Town , before they went down to Chigwell . Moreau . They were searched , as I have been informed ; I was not at home . Prisoner . They demanded 200 Guineas of me ; then they fell to 100 , then to 50 , and there the Matter stuck . Acquitted . 75.

George Sealey and Thomas Freeman ; were indicted , Sealey for committing the horrid and detestable Sin of Buggery , with the said Freeman ; and Freeman for wickedly and wilfully consenting , and permitting the said Sealey to commit the horrid Crime aforesaid , March the 5th And , Thomas Freeman and George Sealey were indicted , Freeman for committing the said horrid and detestable Crime with the said Sealey ; and Sealey for wickedly and wilfully consenting and permitting the said Freeman , to commit the horrid Crime aforesaid , March the 5th . Thomas Palmer . I am a Butcher in Newgate Market ; going home thro ' the Bell Inn , I saw Mr. Freeman and Sealey together in the Yard ; Freeman call 'd out to me , and asked me if I would go and drink a Glass of Wine : I said , I did not care if I did . He took me to one side , says he , this Sealey has got a good deal of Money , if you 'll play a Game at Cards , I will go your our halves : We went directly over to the 3 Tuns next the College of Physicians , and call 'd for a Pint off Wine : We drank half a Glass a piece ; then they two went out into the Yard by themselves , stay 'd there 4 or 5 Minutes , then they came in again and asked for a Candle : This was about 1 or 2 in the Afternoon , and on the 5th of March last . The Candle they said was to go down to the necessary House , and their going down to the Vault together , made me think they were gone to contrive how to win my Money : I wanted to hear what they were saying to one another , so I went softly down , and got almost down to the Door , within a Step or 2 of the Vault Door ; and I heard Freeman say - here he used an Expression which implied a Sodomitical Intention ; but there being a Candle in the inside of the Vault . I went nearer , and put my Eye to a Crack in the Door , and I saw Freeman bending ; his Knees were on the Ground , or very near ; one Hand by the Side of the necessary House , his Breeches down , and his Shirt up , that I could see half way up his Back . Sealey had his Breeches down . - ( Here he mention 'd several Circumstances shocking to Nature , not fit to be repeated . ) I was frighted and walk 'd up Stairs softly ; I ran into the Market , and call 'd Freshwater ; we ran back again , and William Vincent seeing us run , follow 'd us ; Freshwater went down Stairs , and he will tell you , what he saw . The next Morning I went before Alderman Billers , and got a Warrant for them . Q . Give an Account of the Situation of the Place ? Palmer . The little House wants a Step or 2 of the Bottom of the Cellar , and the Door opens directly fronting the Seat , and except they have alter 'd it , there is a Crevice down the Middle . With respect to me , they stood Side-ways ; and Sealey was behind him , but not between Freeman and the Door ; Freeman 's other Hand was against the Wall , or the Boards , and Sealey stood shoving behind him ; if they both had not been sideways to the Door , I could not have seen them . After they came up Stairs , Freeman sat down by the Fire , and there was as much - ( Here he swore positively to the Fact , attended with lewd Discourse and unnatural Circumstances ) . I heard Freeman say this once or twice , - twice it was ; for I heard him before I put my Eye to the Crack , and once afterwards . I have 20 Gentlemen of good Consideration to my Character . I have no more to say . Counsel . I think you say , the first Thing you saw , was with relation to Sealey . Palmer . Yes , Freeman was Patient . Counsel . I find you have some Notion of the Thing . Pray when the Vault Door opens , do n't it touch the Edge of the Seat ? What Size is this Place ? Is it possible for a Man to lie down , his Legs extended behind him , and another to stand there too ? Palmer . Why here 's Room enough for a Man , to stand behind me , and do it , in this very Place , ( where the Witnesses stand ) and the Vault is bigger than this . Counsel . Had you never any Conversation with Mr. Hodgson on this Affair ? Palmer . I had some talk with him . Counsel . In that Discourse , was there no mention of Cuttings and Turner ? Palmer . Mr. Freeman had a Trial with Turner at Guildhall . Cuttings and Turner came to me , and wanted me to go with them to Guildhall ; I would not go without a Subpoena . I went , but never was called . Counsel . Had you any Discourse with Mr. Hedgson , more than once about this Affair ? Palmer . He came to me once or twice , about my not prosecuting Freeman , the same Month the Fact was committed . Counsel . Then I ask you , if you did not say , you had no just Cause to prosecute Freeman ? Palmer . No , I did not . I only told him I had no quarrel with Freeman ; I owed him no ill-will ; and I do this in justice to the Publick . Counsel . Have not you applied to him ; in order to have Money ? Palmer . No , never in my life , neither to Mr. Hodgson , nor Freeman . Counsel . How long have you known Freeman ? Palmer . Eight or nine Years . Counsel . Is he marry 'd ? Palmer . I believe so ; he lives with a Woman , and has two Children . Counsel . Did you ever hear any Imputation of this kind before ? Palmer . No , never . Counsel . How does he live with his Wife ? Palmer . Very friendly with her . Counsel . I ask you , if you do not know that he is very fond of his Wife ? Palmer . I never saw him quarrel with her in my life . Freeman . Did Freshwater go down ? Palmer . Yes , and I saw him push the Door open little by little , 'till to my thinking he could get his Head in : The Door was neither locked nor bolted . W. Freshwater . I know both the Prisoners : Freeman is a Butcher , and Sealey is a Pig man , a Higler . On Friday the 5th of March , I went with Palmer to the Wine Cellar . He trembled like an Aspen Leaf , and told me he had seen something he never saw before in his life . At the Cellar Door , he said to me , Colonel , Colonel , listen , listen : I heard a humming , and went down three or four Stairs and came up again - by G - d , says I , there 's something the matter , more than ordinary : I went down again , and heard a jumbling of the Vault Door , I came up , and said to Vincent , by G - d they are b - g one another : I went down again , and pushed the Door inwards , softly , it gave way a little and a little by degrees . When it was opened far enough , I put my Head in , and saw them , the Candle stood on the Left-hand side of the Seat . Sealey lay with his Breeches down , near the Seat of the Vault , and they were pushing one another very close ; Freeman 's Breeches were down likewise . I pulled my Head back , and the Door clapped too , then I was in the dark . I felt about and found a little Cask , I got upon that , and looked over the Partition , where there was a Slip of a Board broke off , I put my Head over , looked in , and saw Freeman 's - Here he gave much the same Evidence as Palmer as to the Fact . Counsel . Have you never been applied to , to give Evidence in this Matter ? Freshwater . Yes , I was subpoena 'd to give Evidence in a Trial between Turner and Freeman at the Common Pleas . Counsel . Have not you declared you knew no ill of Freeman ? Freshwater . I did say I knew no ill of him 'till this 5th of March : I said I would do nothing to his Prejudice , except I had a fair Subpoena . Counsel . How many People will this Vault hold ? Freshwater . Why , if there 's Room for one Man to go into it , and shut the Door , it will hold two Men on such Business . Two large Men may go in , one may go in first , and the other may get in when the Door is half way open . W. Vincent . I know the two Prisoners . I saw the two Witnesses run through the Bell Inn , and I followed them to the Wine Cellar , but when I got to the Door of the House , Palmer was standing at the Top of the Cellar Stairs : He points to me to keep back . I wondered what they were at , and presently up came Freshwater , and swore they were at it . Afterwards he told me in a Fright , Tom Freeman and Sealey were b - g one another , and he went down again . I do not know how the Light stood , but I saw the Light of a Candle , and I went back into the Kitchen , and then Freeman and Sealey came up . Freeman I thought was a little in Liquor , and Sealey very much . There was something on Freeman 's Apron , but I can not say what it was . On the Top of the Vault there is a Board or two out , and a Man may put his Head in . The Place is so big , that Mr. Edwards and I have been in it together , and I believe two more might stand in it . Freeman 's Defence . I stand indicted for a most horrid Crime , it is a Shame to express it . I never was in the Prisoner 's Company but that Day . He bought Meat of me , which came to four Shillings and ten Pence Half penny ; I sent it to the Bell Inn where his House stood ; my Servant came back , and said , the old Man would not pay for it : I carried it to him my self , and asked him for the Money : We drank together , and I agreed to trust him 'till next Market Day ; but he went away without paying his Share for what we drank at the Bell Inn . The Man of the House advised me to go after him for the Money . I went , and he told me if I would go with him to the Wine Vault , he would pay me , and give me a Pint of Wine . We had been drinking Ale and Brandy , so I call 'd Palmer to go with us ; and we 3 drank a Pint of Wine : Sealey would not pay for that , but he said , if we would play at Cards he should get Money to pay : Upon this he went out into the Yard , and according to Palmer 's Directions I followed him to get him to play . He wanted to go into the Cellar he said , but could not find the Vault : The Maid gave him a Candle , and I followed him down and sat upon the Stairs untill he came out . When we came up , they never charged us with any Crime , but Palmer called me on one side , and said , we 'll be even with this old Son of a B - h , we 'll go the Fountain Tavern thro ' Newgate , call for a Pint of Wine , and leave him to pay . We all went there , and came away ; leaving the old Man behind us at the Tavern . Next Morning I heard it was reported I had b - g - d Sealey . I sent for Vincent to the White Horse in Warwick Lane , and desired him to tell me what he know of the Design . He told me Palmer and Freshwater had raised the Report ; then I will sue them says I . In the Morning a Man told me , that Spratley had advised Palmer to swear it , and told him if he did so , I could not sue him : Palmer swore it , and my Friends advised me to keep up Stairs . I never heard how the Matter stood . 'till Mr. Edwards told me , I must go with him to execute Releases with Palmer and Freshwater . On the 10th of April , Mr. Turner call 'd me Buggerer , I su 'd , and cast him : he got acquainted with one Cuttings a Soliciter in the Old Bailey , and they 2 gave Mr. Salter Directions to draw the Bill for Sodomy against me . Palmer declared he gave no Directions at all , and Freshwater declared he knew no hurt of me . After the Bill was drawn , Cuttings insisted upon their swearing and gave them Subpoenas . Mr. Edwards hearing this , went to Cuttings and Turner , and to the Man who swore against me . Freshwater told him , that Cuttings and Turner were the Men who would him joyn in the Bill . On the 6th of July , Palmer told me that Trade was so dead , he must make a Demand upon me ; and says he , you know upon what Account : Twice they sent for me to the Magpye , but I would not go . One Thursday I over-heard Turner and his Wife quarreling about some Money , and he told her he had been in company with Cuttings , Palmer and Freshwater ; and says he if you 'll give them 5 Guineas a piece , they 'll swear so , as to hang Freeman . And on Saturday July 12th , Palmer told me that Cuttings and Turner offer 'd me 5 Guineas to swear , and unless you 'll give me 5 Guineas I will ; I bid him swear and be - d ; Afterwards he told me , tho ' I would not give him 5 Guineas , Mr. Edwards would ; I got Constable and took him up , and he fell on his , knees and declared he knew no hurt of me . Nathaniel Edwards . In February or March , I had word brought me of this Affair ; the Prisoner Freeman marry 'd my Sister , therefore I concerned my Self in it : I sent for him , to my House , and he gave me the same Account , he has now given . I blamed him for keeping Company with such Scandalous Persons as the 2 Witnesses , who are reputed Gamesters , and their Characters bad I advised him to stop the Report , by making the matter up with them ; telling him , it was a Shame such a Thing should be brought before a Court . He said , he was innocent , and absolutely refus 'd . I desired him to leave it to me ; he said I might do as I pleas 'd . I sent for Freshwater , and en-quired of him concerning the Fact ; he told me he saw them plainly in the Vault ; but says he , I have not sworn nor will I if you 'll be civil . I expect something , if I do not Prosecute . Then I went to Palmer ; he told me he had sworn , but he was sorry for it ; he did not desire to hurt him , but the Butchers in the Market , had urged him to it . Palmer told me he was willing to make it up , if he could do it safely , for he knew no hurt of Freeman ; and I took the Expression to be without any Exception . I was uneasy about the other Prisoner Sealey , so I took my Horse and rode to Bushy to enquire his Character , and I found all his Neighbours gave him a very good one . Sealey 's Wife told me , it was impossible the Charge could be true , and gave me a Reason , very convincing , that it could not be . After this , Palmer and I , and his Lawyer had several meetings at the 3 Tunns in Wood 's Close ; one Time he insisted on 15 Guineas , and said if some People had the Job , they would make 20 or 30 of it : But after many Words , we agreed for 5 , to sign General Leases , and I was to be at all the Expence . I paid the Money , and the writings were executed . Then I went to Freshwater , but he 'd do nothing without his Lawyer , who lives at the Goat Alehouse in Long Lane : We all met at the Vine in Gray Friar 's ; Freshwater said , he had no design to Prosecute , but he wanted Money to defray the Charges of a Bastard Child , he had at Hitchen . He said he 'd leave to my Honour , what he should have : I bid him come to my House ; he came , and I gave him a Guinea and a half . Some time after , Freeman and Turner having been at Law , Palmer told me at the Gentleman and Porter in Shoe Lane , that he was bid 10 Guineas to swear on the other side : Cuttings and Turner , says he , have been with me , but if you 'll give me as much , I had rather have the Money from you . I told him , I thought we had made an End before ; but if this Money would certainly be the last , I would give it . He said , he must have 5 Guineas that Night , I told him he should have it ; but after we had made this other Agreement , they took Freeman up . After the Trial between Turner and Freeman , Freshwater declared he would not come against Freeman any more , and asked me for a Guinea , says he , I have had but a Guinea and a half yet , and 't is very hard , if I ca n't make a little more Money of this than what will just defray the Expence of a Bastard Child . I said I was weary of parting with my Money so ; then says he , let me have half a Guinea , I refused then d - n ye , says he , it shall be the worse for you , and so we parted . Counsel . Tho ' Palmer and Freshwater said they knew no Harm of him , had you no suspicion of his being guilty , that occasion 'd you to give your self all this Trouble , and to throw your Money about , in order to have it hush 'd , and made up ? Nathaniel Edwards . I would have given 30 Guineas to have prevented the Scandal . Counsel . But could you imagine that general Re-leases would discharge a criminal Prosecution ? What was it you gave them this Money for ? Nathaniel Edwards . To make and End of the Dis-pute on both Sides . Counsel . But as there were Warrants out , the Prosecution was on Foot . Mr. Hodgson . Mr. Edwards , sent for me to his House , and there I found Freshwater . I asked him some Questions and he said he might make a good Advantage of this Affair , for he had seen them . Mr. Edwards was for making it up , and asked him where he might see Palmer , for he had left the Market . Freshwater said he could not see him , unless he went with him : he agreed to carry us to him , and at the 3 Tuns in Wood 's Close , a Gentleman saw Palmer . This the beginning of March . I asked Palmer how the Fact was committed ; he said they went down together , privately to play at Cards , and I saw them in the Vault together , and the Candle , but I saw no farther Action . I acquainted Mr. Edwards with this , and the next Orders I had from him , were to meet him at the same Place with Releases . I went there , and found Mr. Edwards , Palmer and Freshwater , Palmer 's Wife and another Gentleman . Mr. Edwards went into another Room with Palmer 's Wife , and when they return 'd Mr. Edwards asked her before the Company , if she was satisfy 'd : she declared she was satisfy 'd ; and on that the Releases were executed . After this I was sent for to the Vine in Gray Friars , to execute Releases between Freshwater and Freeman . Freshwater told me he had made it up with Mr. Edwards , and a Release from Freshwater to Freeman was executed . The next Notice I had , was from Mr. Edwards in Rose-street ; he told me Freshwater had proposed to make an Affidavit , that he knew no Hurt of Freeman ; upon Cuttings and Turners sending for him to swear against Freeman at the Old Bailey . I drew up an Affidavit , and at an appointed Time , met Mr. Edwards and Freshwater . In the Affidavit Freshwater declared , that Cuttings and Turner had been with him several Times about this Business . The Affidavit was read over twice to him , and he made several Alterations in it ; and then read over to him literatim and distinctly . The Affidavit was produced and read . After Freshwater had made this Affidavit , Mrs. Edwards sent for me again : 't was that very Day the Grand Jury was discharged the Sessions before last . I went and found Palmer with her . He said that Cuttings and Turner had sent for him to swear to an Indictment against Freeman , and he asked me if they could compel him to swear ; I told him it was reasonable he should swear to the Truth . Samuel Edwards 's Evidence was to the same Purport , adding that from a View of the Place , he thought it impossible this Crime could be committed there ; it not being ( as he thought ) 2 Feet wide , and the Door without either Crack or Crevice . Then appear 'd to Freeman 's Reputation , John Duck , John Page , Bryan , and Francis Philpot , John Sturges , and George Gale ; who all gave him a very good Character . To Sealey 's Character , Robert Waller , Thomas Hodsdon , Will . Raines . Jo Nichols , John Bellows , John King , and John Fuller who thought him a Man of Reputation , and that he would not do such a Thing . Then was call 'd to Palmer and Freshwater 's Character , Joseph Tibbot , who had known Palmer up-wards of 7 Years , that he was his Apprentice , that indeed he did break , but that he believed he would not forswear himself for 500 l. - Samuel Saunders swore he thought Palmer would not forswear himself on any Account - Anne Sutton , she was Freshwater 's Mistress , she warn 'd him to do Justice , and speak the Truth , and believ 'd he would not forswear himself on any Account ; Godfrey Newton , and William Sprately , gave likewise the Witnesses good Characters . Acquitted . 80. Joseph Caddy . was indicted for willful and corrupt Perjury , in falsely swearing before Richard . Groombridge , Deputy Philazer for the County of Surrey , in the Name and Person of Richard Willson of Fish Street Hill , Carpenter ; that John Knowles was indebted to him in the Sum of 900 l - on note of Hand . That Thomas Cant was indebted to him 300 l. - That Joseph Truss was indebted to him 500 l. - And Robert Walker , the Sum of 700 l. for Goods sold and deliver 'd , June the 25th . John Cuthbert . I was at that Time , Clerk to Mr. Constable . The Prisoner came to an Alehouse in Dolphin Court , on Ludgate Hill , the 25th of June , 't was the first Day of last Term ; Mr. Turner who keeps the Alehouse fetch 'd Mr. Constable to him ; in about 6 or 8 Minutes he came back and said , there was a Man at the Alehouse had given him Orders to make out an Affidavit for a great deal of Money ; he said , he did not much like it , but however the Affidavit was drawn , and I engross 'd it in his Presence , at the Alehouse , and read it over to him , and he signed it Richard Wilson . After this we went to the Philazer of Surrey 's Office in the Temple , and there he swore to it . Thomas Davenport . Mr. Groombridge and my Self , act as Deputies to Mr. John Bicknell , who is Philazer of the Country of Surrey . I was in the Office when this Affidavit was made ; I believe the Prisoner to be the Man . Mr. Groombridge swore him , and when he was gone , he said it was very unlikely such Sums should be due to such a sort of a Man . The Prisoner 's dirty Dress was describ 'd by Cuthbert and this Witness . John Maybank and Cuthbert prov 'd the Writ , which was taken out of the Sheriffs Office , on the Affidavit . Davenport . The Prisoner at that Time took on him the Name of Richard Wilson . ( The Affidavit was produced and read . ) Counsel . He took on him the Name of Wilson , and there is no such Person in Rerum Natura . therefore it it is in reality his own Suit . ( The Writ was produced and read . ) John Carter . On Midsummer Day , the Prisoner was at my House , and swore he would be revenged of Knowles , for he would arrest him in an Action of 900 l. and I 'll do it says he in a Fictitious Name . John Windall . I executed the Writ , but I thought there was some Roguery in it , so I went to the Philazer 's Office to see if there was an Affidavit fil 'd there . This is the Warrant delivered to me , by Vertue of which , I arrested the 4 Men , I know the Prisoner to be a vile Fellow . John Knowles . I was surprised at being arrested for such a Sum , knowing I was not indebted to any one living in any Sum like this , and enquired after this Richard Wilson , but there was no such Person to be found . Thomas Cant . I know nothing of this Wilson , nor do I owe any Money to any Man of that Name . Joseph Truss , and Robert Walker deposed the same . The Prisoner made no Defence , but only denied the Fact . Guilty . [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour . See summary . ] 81. Richard Sanders was indicted for stealing a Gold Ring with a Chrystal Stone , from the Person of Priscilla , Wife of Thomas London , July 20 , 1733 . Priscilla London . I employed the Prisoner to get in some Debts for me , and in July , I do n't well know the Day , he was looking on my Hand in our Kitchen , and says he , you have a very beautiful Ring , let me see it : then he took hold of my Hand , and took it off my Finger ; Madam , says he , there is a Noise at your Door , and up he got , and away he ran with it . I met him next Day in the Minories , and he told me I should have it again . I looked after him for half a Year , and then I gave him over . Prisoner . Madam , do n't you remember the Day , you and I were at Well 's , the Cooks , in Leadenhall-street , when you and I had Pig for Dinner ? I have been a little foolish in loving your Sex too much ; but , pray Madam , have not you own 'd , you would never have taken me up , if I had not told your Husband , that you gave it me for a Merry Bout you and I had together ? Do n't you know that Charlesworth was to bring an Action against me for Criminal Conversation with you ! Did not you declare , you was obliged to take out a Warrant against me to please your Husband ? Priscilla London . What I said , was , that you was a good for nothing Man , and when I heard your Wife say , that you and I were gone together , I said to my Husband , now go and take him up for the Ring . You made no Ring but a laugh of me , and bid me kiss your - Prisoner . Did not your Husband come to my House and offer to make it up for 6 s. Priseilla London . I heard that you offer 'd 6 s. ? but my Husband would not agree . I did go to the Justices to have it decided , but you had no Money to pay for Stamps , nor general Releases . Prisoner . Did not you agree afterwards to make it up again for 14 s. London . Yes , my Husband had your Note for 14 s but he flung it to you again , at the Justice 's . Prisoner . She keeps a Baudy House in Squirrel Alley ; I 'll prove you gave me the Ring at Wells 's a Cook 's in Leaden-Hall street , where we din 'd together ; then I went home with you , and you and I drank 2 or 3 Drams together . Do n't you know when you met me in the Minories the next Day , that you said , My dear , do you intend to keep the Ring , or have one made , and I said , my Dear , the Ring is safe enough . Thomas Harrison . I dined with the Prosecutor and Prisoner in Leaden Hall Street , we had Pig , and strong Beer , and a Bottle of Wine for Dinner , up one pair of Stairs . The Ring was on her Finger then , and he said , my Dear , lend me that Ring , she gave it him , and said , there my Dear , there it is . London . I never saw this Man in my Life . J. Lancashire . I saw Mrs. London and the Prisoner in Wood-street Compter ; they were making up the Matter , but he wanted Money , I went home to fetch him Money , but when I came back , I found a fresh Warrant taken out against him , and that he was sent to Newgate . Mrs. London told me she never intended to have let it come to this . John Philpey . Mrs. London owned before me , that she believed he did not take the Ring with any Design to keep it . Mary Green . Mrs. London 's Husband said in my hearing , he would make it up for 12 s. Acquitted . Receiv 'd Sentence of Death 6.
