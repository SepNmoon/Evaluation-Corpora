Between eight and nine at night as I was going home , my Heels were tripp 'd up near Temple Bar by a Man who pretended to help me up again ; he picked my Pocket of my Watch , and said , he would carry me to an honest House where I might clean my self . He took me to one Mrs. Warwick 's in Sheer Lane , where I found the Landlady Warwick and the Prisoner who was her Servant , and another Woman . The Man call 'd for a Pint of Wine , and I said to the Women , This Man has robbed me of my Watch ; upon which he ran out . Then the Woman scraped the Dirt off my Cloaths , after which I gave Warwick half a Guinea to change for the Wine . But when I asked her for my Change . She told me she must have that for cleaning my Cloaths ; and she promised to help me to my Watch again . Then they shut the Door upon me , and the other Woman held my Hands while Warwick took half a Guinea out of my Pocket , and she said she 'd keep it to get my Watch . We sat down for half an Hour , and then they got a Guinea more from me in the same manner , but I got that again by main force , though it was not long before Warwick got it from me a second time . As for the Prisoner she did nothing to me all the while , but stood by , only she went twice to the Door , and held it that I should not get out . I staid there three Hours , and was as sober then as I am now , but the Door being shut I knew not how to help my self , and was forced to bear with this usage for fear they should do me a mischief . There is a private Door that goes out of this House into another as bad ( where one Bishop keeps a Gin Shop ) and , as I have been informed , when a Man is robbed in one of these Houses , the Thieves whip through this Door into the other House , and so escape . And so I was served at last , for Warwick , and the other Woman got off this way , and left me and the Prisoner together . I asked her where they were gone , and she said she would go and find them - I went home and came again next Day to take them up , but could meet with none but the Prisoner . Prisoner . This Man came to our House with two Women , Moll Nutton , and Beck Bean , and called for a Pint of Wine , which I carried in , and then left them together . Walmsley .

About eleven at Night as I was coming down Cornhill in order to go to my Habitation in Goodman 's Fields , I saw the Prisoners at the Corner of Grace Church Street , and crost over to them and invited them to drink . We went to the Spread Eagle . where I call 'd for a Pint of Wine , and sat betwixt 'em before the Fire . Court . Then you were pretty warm ? Cole . Yes , in the middle : And so says Jenny Roan , What do we come here for ? And with that she claps her Hands to my Breeches to unbutton 'em , and by and by she goes out , pretending she wanted to make water , and Peg Young follows her . I wonder 'd they staid so long ; and thinking it might be time to go home , I felt for my Watch to see what o'Clock it was , but no Watch could I find . I call 'd the Drawer , and asked him if he knew the Women . He said no . But however , I met with them a few Nights afterwards , and having a Warrant , I apprehended them , one of them produced the Watch , and they sent for a Man to make it up . Edward Hoare , The Prisoners came to my Master ( Mr. Calcot 's , ) to pawn this Watch for two Guineas . Young took it out of her Bosom . I told 'em if they would produce the Owner I would lend them the Money , but otherwise they should neither have Money nor Watch , for I would advertise it . Upon this they began to make a strange Uproar . Upon which , I sent for my Master , who is a Common Council Man , and was gone to the Bell Tavern upon Parish Affairs - Peg Young hearing where he was , went to him and rioted him before all the Company , so that he was forced to come home with her , and at last he gave her the Watch , and told her she was a noisy Bitch , and bid her go about her business . Jane Roan . The Prosecutor gave me a full Discharge under his Hand , here it is . Cole . That 's only a Receipt for a Shilling . Clerk reads . March 18 1734-5 .

Peggy , says he , its bloody cold , I fancy your Maiden-head and mine will keep one another warm . I told him I could not oblige him without a Present . Why , says he , I have not much Money , but if you 'll oblige me , I 'll give ye my Watch to pledge for a Guinea . And so he gives me the Watch accordingly , for he knew where I lived : And next Morning he comes and demands this Watch again , and gives me a Guinea to redeem it ; whereof he had his Watch again tho ' I ought to have kept it till he had given me the New Gown he had promised me - Besides he run me to sixteen Shillings charge in Coach-hire and Wine and Veal Cutlets for him and the Constable . And after he had sworn I had robb 'd him , he told Alderman Brocas , it was a Mistake for he had found his Watch in his Coat Pocket . It 's not the first time he has pledged his Watch to be obliged by me and by other Women too , for he makes a common Practice of it . The Jury Acquitted the Prisoners . 25.

The Goods and Money we lost were taken out of a Nest of Drawers which stood upon a Dresser in the same Shop . We had a Rush Candle burning by us all Night . The Door was left upon the Latch that my Sister might come in , in the Morning without disturbing us . We went to bed about eleven , and saw no body , nor heard the least Noise all the rest of the Night : But the next Day the Nest of Drawers was missing , and at Night it was found in the Cellar , but the Goods and Money were taken out of it . I have known the Prisoner Richard Buckley about a Year , and never heard any ill of him till I was informed by his Son Butler Buckley , a little Boy , that he and the other Prisoner , his Brother , with Sweet and Wilkinson , who were both hanged at Kingston , for robbing the Church , were the Men who had robbed my House . Mary Audry ( Mr. Clark 's Sister ) I got up between seven and eight in the Morning , and mist the Case of Drawers off the Dresser ; I found the Back Door which leads into Princes Street half open , which I am sure was bolted a little before it was dark - there are two Back Doors , one to the House , and one to the Yard - The next Night I found the Nest of Drawers in the Cellar , but the Money and Goods were taken out . John Busby . I live at Kingston . On Saturday the eighth of March , at Night , after I and my Wife were gone to Bed , there was an attempt made to rob my House by some Persons who came up the Passage . On Sunday the Church was robbed . At Night the little Boy , Butler Buckley , came up the Passage to my House . My Boy seeing him , asked where he was going . He answered he was going to the Oven to warm himself . My Boy told him there was no Oven that way . I coming up , took hold of Butler 's Hand , upon which he screamed out , and begged me not to send him to Bridewell . I asked him if he knew what Bridewell was . He said , no , but he was afraid I would send him there . I led him to Mr. Belcher , who examined him where his Father and Mother were . He told us first at one place and then at another , but both proved to be false . We caught him in several Lies , and so he was sent to the Stock-house . Next Morning he confest that he came down to Kingston with his Father and Uncle ( the two Prisoners ) and William Sweet and Phillip Wilkinson , and that on Saturday Night they attempted to rob my House , and on Sunday robbed the Church ; and farther , that they had robbed Mr. Clark ( the Prosecutor ) 's House at Little Turn-Stile in Holborn , and another House upon Little Tower-Hill , and gave us an account of what they took from each . I and Mr. Banford resolving to enquire into these things , we took Horse and rode to the Swan with Two Necks in Tothill Street , where we put up , and from thence went to Mr. Clark ( the Prosecutor 's ) and enquired if he had been robbed , and of what . He said , yes , and named the particulars , which agreed with the account the Boy had given us . We asked him if he knew Butler Buckley . Mr. Clark said , yes , very well , that he had often been at their House , and they had given him Victuals ; that his Father ( the Prisoner Richard ) was a Drawer at the Sultana 's Head Tavern in the Hay-Market , and his Mother lodged at the Green Canister at the upper end of Oxenden Street , in Piccadilly . We told him what the Boy had informed us of , at which he appeared to be very much surprised . Mr. Banford and I then went to the Green Canister , and there meeting with the Boy 's Mother , we took her to the Sultana Tavern , where we found her Husband ( the Prisoner Richard ) and told him what his Boy had told us . He said that Sweet was a notorious Rogue , and had enticed the Boy to Kingston . Richard agreed to go with us to look for Sweet . We were informed that he was gone but that very Day to be a Drawer at the Bell at Aldgate . We found him there , and took him with us in a Coach to the Swan in Tothill Street , where we sat up all the remaining part of the Night . The Warrant we then had was only for taking Sweet and Wilkinson . But next Day Mr. Clark went to Kingston , and got a Warrant for the two Prisoners , and thereupon Richard Buckley was sent to the Gate-house . His Brother John hearing of it , went to him , and afterwards came to the Swan and Two Necks , and said , Who wants to speak with me ? Who are you , says I , My Name , says he , is John Buckley , I live at the Cross Keys in Bond Street , and defy all the World to take me . Be ye the Devil , I 'll take you , says I , and so I seiz 'd him . John Banford deposed to the same Effect : And the manner of apprehending the Prisoners and Sweet , was confirmed by Richard Mitchell , the Constable . Butler Buckley , the Boy ( nine Years old the eighteenth of December last ) being examined as to the nature of an Oath , and the consequence of false Swearing , and giving satisfactory Answers , the Court admitted him to be sworn . Butler Buckley . My Father Richard Buckley , and my Uncle John Buckley , and William Sweet , and Phillip Wilkinson ( who were both hang 'd at Kingston ) and I , went out together between six and seven at Night , to rob Mr. Clark 's House at Little Turn-Stile in Holborn . I knew Mr. Clark , and had been at his House several times . When we came there , Mr. Clark and his Wife , and Sister , and Daughter , and two Gentlemen were sitting by the Fire in the Shop , and the Screen was drawn . My Father put me in at the Shop Door , which was open , about eight o'Clock . I went and hid my self in the House of Office till between one and two in the Morning , and then I opened the Entry Door on the left side of the House leading into the Alley ( Little Turn-Stile ) - 'T is the Door where the Lodgers go in and out . I let in Wilkinson , and Sweet , and went out my self , and found my Father and Uncle standing to watch . One of them stood at the end of the Alley next Holborn , and the other at the end next Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Wilkinson and Sweet staid about half an Hour , and then they brought out ten Guineas , nine Silver Spoons , and two Suits of Brussels Laced Head Cloths , which I saw as soon as we came home , and we went home directly .

Pray , my Lord , take notice of that , Court . How came you to make this Discovery ? Boy . Mr. Busby took me at Kingston , and forced me to tell . Court . How did he force ye ? Boy . He said he 'd turn me at my own liberty , if I wou 'd confess the truth . Court . Did he say any thing to you about your Father or Uncle ? Boy . No . Court . Who named them first ? Boy . I my self . Court . Did he , or any other at Kingston mention Mr. Clark 's House ? Boy . No . Court . How came you to speak of it then ? Boy . Because I had a mind to own it all out . Mr. Busby . I had heard nothing of Mr. Clark , till the Boy spoke of it himself . R. Buckley . Was not the Boy whipt and hung up by the Heels ? Mr. Busby . Mr. Bailiff Belcher shewed him a Whip , to make him confess where he came from , and the Justice threatned to send him to Bridewell , and have him whipt there , if he would not tell who he belong 'd to . R. Buckley , to the Boy . When and where did you see me and your Uncle together ? Boy .

The Defence of the Prisoners . R. Buckley . I have taken what care I could in giving my Boy good Instructions , but my care had but little effect on him . He was always very perverse , and a notorious Lyar , for which I have often corrected him , though not with severity , for fear of hardening him . On Friday Night the seventh of March , I sent him to Cranburn Alley for some Worsted . He staid out that Night ; I asked him next Day where he had been ; he said , with Mrs. Loyd . Butler , says I , Your Chalks are out , and we must reckon . But I being sent for , he ran away , and I saw him no more till Tuesday following ; for as I was informed , Sweet and Wilkinson had decoyed him to go with them to Kingston : But he did not go to Kingston till Sunday , as I shall prove , tho ' he swears he lay there on Saturday Night . I had not seen my Brother John for near five Years , till I was taken up , there having been a Quarrel between us ; but then I sent him word of his being in the Warrant . J. Buckley .

She and her Husband had lived at Martha Macrakans a Year and two Months ; they moved thence to the Canister , on a Monday , about a Month before he was taken . I never saw his Brother John at Mrs. Macrakans . * The House was robbed on Monday Night , as Mr. Clark deposed . R. Buckley . I was taken in March : The House was robbed in November : The Boy swore I then lived at the Canister - and that my Brother John had been several times with me at Mrs. Macrakans .

He pray 'd me to tell Mrs. Gaskins her Cousin wanted to speak with her . She came to him ; he said , How do you do Cousin ? She asked him how he came to be out so late and so far from home . He told her he came to play with her Son Bobby . She chid him , and threatned to send him to his Father , but at last took him in . Sarah Gaskin .

He was a very good Servant , and never out of his Business , but when he went to see after his Boy , who had been a great Grief to him . R. Buckley . The Boy swore I was with him at Kingston on Saturday Night the eighth of March . Mrs. Fromage . That Night he was waiting on some Noble Men at my , House and they burnt his Wig ; and next Morning they gave him half a Crown a piece to make him amends - He complained that his Boy was missing , and he was afraid he was got into ill Company . John Ferry . I am a Waiter at the same House . On Saturday the eighth of March , several Noble Men dined at our House , and bespoke a Dinner on Sunday . The Prisoner waited on them , and I left him there at twelve on Saturday Night . On Sunday Morning I saw his Wig was burnt , and at Noon he and I breakfasted at Mrs. Bonifaces . I left him at eleven that Night . He being taken up the Tuesday following , I I set down the Day of the Month that I might not forget it . Mary Whitron . I am servant at the Sultana .

I went to see the Boy in Bridewell , at Kingston , and told him I was sorry to see him in such a place . He said he did not mind it , for he should be a brave Man when the two Men were hang 'd at Kingston , and his Father and Uncle at Tyburn - He 's an impudent , lying , mischievous Boy . John Herring . I live at the Cross Keys , in New Bond-street . John Buckley lodged there a Year and a Quarter . He went away at Midsummer last , and has not been there since , but lived at a House in Tyburn Road . R. Buckley . The Boy swore that my Brother lived in Bond street when he was taken , and that we often met together lately , but I have not spoke to him several Years on account of a difference between us . Robert Forest . Richard had been very kind to his Brother John while he was an Apprentice ; but about five Years ago John disobliged Richard , by refusing to make a Pair of Shoes for his Wife , upon which they fell out . I met Richard two Months ago , and prest him to be reconcil 'd , but says he , I ca n't be friends with him , for I have been a Father to him , and he 's an ungratefull Rascal . William Griffin . John Buckley lived next Door to me three Quarters of a Year , and I believe he 's a very honest Man .
