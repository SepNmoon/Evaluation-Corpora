Samuel Fog . This is the Letter that the Witness ( Durham ) brought to my Master last Saturday in the Afternoon ; it was deliver 'd to me , and I gave it to Mr. Bell . To Mr. Bell , Merchant , in Lombard-street . These . SIR , Saturday , Jan. 7 , 1737. `` WE are four Persons who are now under a `` Cloud , and are forced to raise a Sum `` of Money , which we are not able to do , so `` that our Interest is at Stake , and our Families `` are like to come to Shame ; for which Reason `` we are forced to use this Method , and borrow `` Money of you , and we know a small Sum will `` be no Detriment to you , till we are able to pay `` you again ; therefore we desire you to lend us `` an Hundred Guineas , which shall be paid you again `` in twelve Months , with the Interest thereof ; `` and in so doing you will oblige , Yours , Unknown. `` P. S. This Secret we command you not to `` divulge , upon Pain of Death , to neither Friend `` nor Foe : If we know you make Enquiry after `` us to betray us , ( which is impossible ) you shall `` never be safe at Home or abroad , for your `` whole Interest shall never satisfy us , if any one `` of us should come to Trouble on your Account , `` neither will we be denied the Money ; so we leave `` you to consider , whether you love your Life , `` or your Money best . We must have it in this `` Manner ; put 100 Guineas into a large Hat-box , `` stuffed with Straw or Hay , and directed `` to John James Stokes , to be left at the Sign of `` the Crown on Tower-Hill , near Iron-Gate , till `` called for . It must be left at four o'Clock , and `` we desire it may be sent ; so we remain Your obliged Servants , UNKNOWN . Fog . There was another Letter came on Sunday Night ; this Man ( Hunt ) delivered it , and said he had it from a Sailor : When we took the Prisoner , the second Letter was produced , and shewn him ; and he owned the Writing both of that and the former , and said , the Persons that brought them were Innocent . This Confession he made at the White-Hart Alehouse in Grace-church street ; and he told us , that he had been under so many Troubles and Misfortunes , that he was weary of his Life , and was as willing to die as to live . The Second LETTER . For Mr. BELL , Merchant , in Lombard-street . Mr. BELL , Sunday , Jan. 8 , 1737. `` WE wrote a very conformable Letter to `` you Yesterday , and have received no `` Answer ; now we want the Money , and resolve `` to have it by the Bearer , or else your `` Life the first Opportunity . One of us went to `` the Waterman that brought the first Letter , `` and he says you was inquisitive after the Persons `` who sent it . It will be impossible to take `` but one of us , and they that are left will be `` revenged on you the first Opportunity , by Night `` or by Day . We are resolute , and value not `` Life , so desire you to send the Money , and `` with a faithful Promise never to divulge the `` Secret. `` P.S . Sir , We have as many Ways to keep `` clear of you , as you can think of , to betray `` us , for you are not the first Person we have `` borrowed Money of , the same Way . Let it `` be put in something that the Bearer may not `` apprehend what it is . - Hunt . On Saturday Night last he came to an Alehouse where I lodge , ( Mr. Read 's , the King 's Head , on Tower-Hill ) and he staid there all Night ; before he went to Bed he wrote a Letter to his Sweetheart , and desired me to carry it to her three or four Doors from the House ; I did so , and she sent him Word that she was engaged , and would not answer his Letter . After this the Prisoner was very merry , and bought Oysters to treat the People of the House . The next Day ( Sunday ) he call 'd for Pen , Ink , and Paper , and went up Stairs , and wrote a Letter , which he gave me , and desired me to carry it to Mr. Bell , a Stocking Merchant , and he would pay me . I went , but Mr. Bell was not at Home , and the Prisoner having ordered me to deliver it into his own Hand , I brought it back . The second Time I went , I found Mr. Bell at Home , so I delivered him the Letter . He asked me if I knew what was in it ? I told him , I did not ; upon this he read it to me , and I was very much surprized . Why , says he , you have brought me a Threatning Letter , and you must tell me who you had it from . I was afraid the Prisoner would run away , so I went with Mr. Bell to look for him , and found him at an Alehouse in Grace-church-street , where Mr. Bell shewed him the Letter he had received from me , he owned he wrote it , and sent it by me , and acknowledged likewise his writing the Letter which Mr. Bell had received the Day before . This is the very same Letter which the Prisoner gave me to carry to Mr. Bell on Sunday . William Hose . The Constable and I , and another Man , went to the White Hart Alehouse , and found the Prisoner : I heard him own his sending the last Letter . - Budge . I was at the apprehending the Prisoner at the White Hart Alehouse . The last Letter was Shewn him by Mr. Fream ; he own 'd he wrote it , and sent it by Hunt . He confess 'd he sent the first likewise , and that they were Demands for Money to be sent to Iron-Gate . Capt . Penhallow , and Alexander Englise gave an Account of the Prisoner 's Good behaviour during a Voyage from Virginia to London , where the Prisoner arriv 'd Nov. 5. last . Matthew Sheppard , Henry Scadding , Ralph Celiard , William Brown , Richard Manning , Mary Nutting , John Bunyan , Elizabeth Brown-john , and the Prisoner 's Father and Mother gave him a good Character . Guilty . Death . James Cope , was indicted for stealing 4 Guineas , 7 half Guineas and 46 s. in Money , 30 gold Rings , val . 6 l. 10 pair of silver Buckles , val . 20 s. 4 large silver Spoons , val . 15 s. 6 silver Teaspoons , val . 6 s. 10 pair of silver shirt Buckles , val . 3 s. a pair of silver Tea-tongs , val . 3 s. a gold Locket , val . 3 s. a Coral , set in Silver , val . s. a small silver Chain , val 2 s. 2 Coral Necklaces , val . 12 d. 3 silver Thimbles , val . 12 d. 2 silver Snuff boxes , val . 10 s. a shell Snuff-box set in Silver , val . 5 s. a Mother of Pearl Snuff-box with silver Ring and a wooden Drawer , the Goods of Elizabeth Goodman in her Shop , in the Parish of St. Butolph Bishop 's Gate , Dec. 23 . Mrs. Goodman . A little after 6 in the Evening , Dec. 23 I had been a Minute or two out of the Shop , and I heard a little Bustling , so I return 'd and saw the Shadow of something in the Shop , and the Hatch at the End of the Counter open . I cry 'd out , stop Thief , but before I could get to the Door , the Thief was gone . I went out into the Street , and heard a Noise like the falling of a Drawer . A Gentleman took the Prisoner and brought him back ; this is the Drawer , which he confess 'd he took out of my Shop , and all the Things mention 'd in the Indictment were in it , when he took it away . I keep a Pawnbroker 's Shop , but these Things are my Property ; I have had some of them several Years . At the same Time , I lost a Bundle of Linnen which I never heard of again . Peter Deval I was coming that Night thro ' Wide Gate-Alley and heard the Cry - Stop Thief ; seeing the Prisoner run with a Drawer in his Hand , I pursu 'd him about the Length of this Hall , then I saw him drop it . I did not stay to take it up , but continu 'd running after him ; I kept him in Sight all the Way , and in Gravel-Lane I took him . As soon as I came up with him , he told me I knew him , and begg 'd of me not to take him ; I did know him indeed , for he liv 'd at a Livery Stable where I kept my Horse , but I told him he must go back to the Place , from whence the Drawer was taken , and I carry 'd him back accordingly . The next Day he was carry 'd before the Lord Mayor ; at first he deny 'd the Fact , but at last he confess 'd that he open 'd the Hatch , and took out of the Shop , a Bundle of Linnen which lay under the Counter , and gave it to a Confederate ; then he went in again ( he said ) and took the Drawer . He impeached 2 Fellows with whom I knew he kept Company , and to them he had given ( he said ) the Bundle of Linnen . Samuel Powel . I live next Door but one to Mrs. Goodman . I heard the Cry - Stop Thief , and saw a Person about the Size of the Prisoner go on the opposite Side of the Way . I push 'd after him and he dropp 'd the Till . I stood by that , while Mr. Deval pursu 'd the Man . He overtook him and brought him back , and we carry 'd him to Wilson the Constable 's House ; the Prisoner deny 'd the Fact at first , but afterwards I heard him confess it , and he told us he would make himself an Evidence against 6 or 7 . The Constable keeps an Alehouse in Bishop's-Gate-Street , and us 'd us very ill , and tho ' we sent a Messenger to my Lord Mayor 's , who brought us Word that my Lord was ready to hear us , and tho ' we call 'd a Coach to tempt him to go , yet he told us he had Customers of his own to mind , and would not go 'till he could spare Time . Mrs. Goodman . The Prisoner told us if we could go before a Justice then , we might get the Bundle of Linnen , but it would be gone ( he said ) if we staid till Morning . Mr. Powel . The Prisoner confess 'd at the Constable 's House , that he went into the Shop , and took out a Bundle first , which he gave his Accomplice ; that upon their urging him to make a second Attempt , he went in again and took this Drawer , with the Things mention 'd in the Indictment . We took an Inventory of all the Things that were in it , as soon as we had pick 'd it up , and they are the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment ; I did not know what was in it when I took it up in the Street . Mrs. Goodman . All the Things that are mention 'd , were in it when 't was taken away ; they were all seal 'd up before my Lord Mayor , and have never been opened till now . Prisoner . I was coming past Mrs. Goodman 's Door that Night about 7 o'Clock , and I saw a Boy run out with the Drawer , he dropt it , and I took it up ; when the Gentlewoman cry 'd stop Thief , I threw it down again , so they took me and carried me to an Alehouse . I am innocent of it as you are . Edward Jones . My Lord , I hope you will take it into Consideration , - this young Youth , - he has been disform 'd in Communication , People have drawn him into Snares ; he never was a Transgression , nor were any of his Family in any Transgression . In the first Place , I desire you will take it into Consideration , that if he has transgressed with other People , - concerning what he said before my Lord-Mayor , it was not with Regard to himself . I beg Favour for him . Thomas Stair , had known the Prisoner 5 or 6 Years , had entrusted him as a weekly Servant with 50 or 60 l. worth of Silk at a Time , and he always behav 'd honestly to him . Guilty , Death . 3. Joseph Smithson , otherwise Smith , was indicted for feloniously ripping , cutting and breaking a leaden Cistern qt . 8 hundred lbs . value 6 l. fixed in Phoenix-Court , in the Parish of St. Augustine and St. Nicholas Cole-Abbey , Dec. 17 . The Goods of Persons unknown , with intent to steal the same , & c Acquitted : He was a 2d Time indicted for feloniously ripping , cutting and stealing 4 hundred weight of Lead , value 45 s. being part of a Cistern , the Goods of Sir Joseph Eyles , and fixed in Alderman 's Walk , to the Dwelling House of Samuel Clark , Dec. 13 , Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 4. Thomas Jenkins , of St. Paul Covent Garden , was indicted for privately stealing a silver Watch with a silk String , value 8 l. from the Person of James Monday , Esq ; Jan. 7 . Mr. Monday . Last Saturday Night I was coming out of Covent-Garden Play-house , and in the Passage leading from the Play-house to the Piazza 's , there stood a Man , and stopp 'd me from going on : I spoke to him , and after some Time he mov 'd on . He was in a blue Coat , and I took him to be a Chairman , so had no Suspicion of him . I pass 'd on towards the Posts , under the Arch next Covent Garden , and there a Fellow stopp 'd between me and the Posts and jostled me . I spoke to him , and shov 'd him from me , upon which he mov 'd on , but my Wife , ( whom I was leading to a Coach ) told me , she believ 'd the Man had pick 'd my Pocket . I immediately found my Watch was gone . I had look 'd upon it to see what Time it was just before I came out of the House , and many Minutes could not pass between that Time , and the Time I lost it . No sooner had I missed it , but a Person came and told me he knew the Man that had taken my Watch , and that he had seen him commit the Fact . He acquainted me where he might be found , and I told him where I liv 'd . The next Day when I came Home from Church , I had Information that a Watchman had been to let me know that the Man who robb 'd me was taken ; I desired a Neighbour to go and enquire into the Matter , and he accordingly did , but he told me the Man had made no Confession . As for the Prisoner , I can not take upon me to say that I know him . Thomas Current . I was going thro ' the Piazza 's that Night with a Captain that came from Bristol , and I saw a Gentleman come out of the Playhouse . I observ 'd the Prisoner to push against him several Times ; after that he snatch 'd away his Watch , and I saw it in his Hand ; but I will not swear it was Mr. Monday , if it was he , he struck at him , and then run away ; upon that I came up to him and inform 'd him he had lost his Watch , and that I believ 'd I knew the Man that took it , and that I could find him out . Then I went a little farther , and saw the Prisoner again , with 10 or 12 of his Gang , besides Link Fellows ; when I came up to him , they told him they believ 'd he was snitch 'd ; upon which he ran a cross Covent Garden , and the Captain that was with me ran after him , but Boots would not overtake Shoes , and so we lost him . The Linkmen afterwards told us of some Houses where we might find him , and after searching several , we found him at Mr. Peartree 's in Colson's-Court , Drury Lane , and the next Day carried him before a Justice . I am positive to the Prisoner , that I saw him very near the Gentleman ; that he put his Hand under his Cloaths , and I saw him take hold of the Watch String , and whip it out of his Pocket . When the Prisoner was taken , his Wife swore bitterly that he should Puff against me . Prisoner . Ask this Witness whether he did not say at Peartree 's that he could not charge me with this Fact ? Current . I 'll tell no Lie about the Matter . The Prisoner is the Man that took Mr. Monday 's Watch , and I have no more to say . Prisoner . But did not you declare that you would not charge me ? Current . No , I never said any such Thing . Tho Osborn . I am Mr. Monday 's Servant , I saw the Prisoner shove my Master several Times , as he came out of the Play-house , and likewise in the Passage . Mr. Eustace . On Sunday Night last , I was at a Tavern with Mr. Justice Midford and the Prisoner , and Mr. Current came in . The Prisoner desir 'd to speak with me . The Justice imagining he intended to make a Discovery , desir 'd me to take him into a private Room ; there he told me , that he would put his Life into my Hands . I told him I did not desire he should do that , but if he could help Mr. Monday to his Watch , I would hear him with Pleasure . Upon this , he own 'd he had taken it , and would take Care that it should be return 'd to him the next Day . I went to him in New-Prison , and there he told me that one Thomas Jones had the Watch , and that he deliver 'd it to another Man , the very Moment that it was taken , and promised me again that it should be deliver 'd to me next Morning at 10 o'Clock , but I never saw any Thing of it . He has promised me to return it Day after Day , but never did so . Prisoner . He came to me and call 'd for a Bottle of Wine and Bread and Cheese , and told me if I would tell him any Thing about the Watch , I should not be hurt , and he told me in the Tavero Kitchen , if I would discover , he would do any Thing to serve me . Mr. Eustace . He was not a Minute in the Tavern before he spoke to me in the manner I have mention 'd , and I told him if he would discover a Gang of 3 or 4 , the Justice ( I believ 'd ) would admit him an Evidence , in order to break up a Gang ; he said he could not , for he was but just enter 'd into a Gang , but he had ( he own 'd ) taken Mr. Monday 's Watch , and would help us to it again . I never saw the Prisoner before that Time , in my Life . Prisoner . When Mr. Current came to me at Peartree 's , he took no Notice of me at first , but went out again to fetch the Watchmen . The Constable search 'd me , and found nothing upon me . Guilty , Death . 5.

See summary . ] 12. George Price , of Isleworth , was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on the 10th of Oct . in and upon Mary his Wife , did make an Assault , and with a certain Knife , value 1d . which he held in his right hand , the said Mary , in and upon the Neck feloniously did strike and cut , giving her in and on the Neck , a mortal Wound , of the breadth of 5 Inches and the Depth of 2 Inches , of which moral Wound she instantly died . The Councel for the King having open 'd the Indictment and the Charge , the Witness were call 'd . Tho Barber . The Deceased lodged in my House . On Monday Oct , 10 , she went out in the Morning , and return 'd about 11 o'Clock , and told me her Husband was come , and she was going to meet him , and to go abroad with him , and she borrow 'd a Hood and Cloak of my Wife . But she not coming Home all Night , I blam 'd my Wife for being so free in lending her Things ; upon which she said she would get Mrs. Lamb to go to the Prisoner 's Master , to know what was become of the Woman Some Time after this , Mrs. Lamb came and told me , she had been at Mr. Cokes , and the Prisoner had told her he had not seen any Thing of his Wife , but if the Hood and Cloak did not come Home again , he would pay for them . Sometime after this , I was mentioning the Thing to a young Man , who came to my House , and he inform 'd me , that the Prisoner fetch 'd his Wife out in a Chaise from the Woolpack , a Publick House in Monkwell-Street . The Prisoner had promised to pay for the Things if they should not be return 'd ; but on Tuesday the 11th of Oct. about 2 or 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon , a Man brought to me in the Shop a Bundle , with a Letter : I asked the Messenger from whence it came ? He told me it came by the Post , and away he went immediately . I open 'd the Bundle , and found the Hood and Cloak , and this Letter with them , which I have compar 'd with about 20 Letters of the Prisoner 's own Hand-writing , found since he absconded , and I apprehend this ( which I receiv 'd with the Things ) is the same Hand with the rest . I examin 'd the outside of the Bundle for the Post Mark , but could find none . What made me suspect the Prisoner the more , was my finding this Stuff in one of the Letters to his Wife ; I think they call it Savin , and there are some Directions in the Letter , concerning the poisoning his Children . Mr. Coke . I have some Knowledge of the Prisoner 's Hand-writing , and I take this Letter ( which came with the Bundle ) to be wrote by him . I have seen him write , and have Receipts now in Court , and a Letter which he sent me the Day after the Fact was committed , and they seem all to be wrote by the same Hand . The Letter produc 'd by Mr. Barber , was read . Mrs. BARBER , I Have sent your Cloak and Hood , and if that Person comes , that I used to call my Husband , for the Box , let him have it ; for I promised when he parted with me , to leave it at Mrs. Lamb 's till he called for it , and was never to see him any more : When I heard he was coming , I thought it my prudent Way to make off , because I have run him so much in Debt . I am now gone to a Relation in the Wild of Kent . Take what other Things there are left , I mean , to pay you and Mrs. Lambe ; if there should not be enough , what is left unpaid , I will send as soon as God sends me any ( Thing ; ) but I was ashamed to stay , when I found it was known that I was not his Wife . From Yours , MARY CMAMBERS . Directed to Mrs. Barber , a Grinder , near Cripplegate . Mr. Barber . Chambers was the Deceased 's Maiden Name ; and this is the very Letter which I received with the Hood and Cloak on Tuesday October 11 . When the Prisoner was examined before the Lord-Mayor , I was present , and heard him own , that he took her out in a Chaise from a House near Cripplegate , and that he delivered her to a Man at the Monument . After I had received this Letter , I went to Mrs. Lamb 's , and there I found the Prisoner ; I told him I was afraid he had made away with his Wife ; he declared his Innocence , and I told him , I had received a Letter which tended to make him innocent , but I doubt you wrote that Letter yourself . Upon this he burst out a crying , and desired me to have a Care what I said , for ( says he ) my Master will not trust me to shave him , if he should hear I am suspected of such a Thing I charged him with having taken his Wife out in a Chaise from a House at Cripplegate ; but he denied it to me , and said he was that Night at the Playhouse , without mentioning which of them . I taxed him farther in the Presence of his Fellow-Servant , upon which he said he would go home to his Master who understood the Law , and he should clear him : He went home to his Master , but he absconded that very Night ; all this passed on the same Day I received the Letter and Bundle , October the 11th , and that very Night he ran away . When I heard of a Woman being found murdered at Hounslow , I went thither , and knew her to be Mary Price ; I found her in the Stock-House at Isleworth , I am positive it was the Deceased , and I found the Scar of a Wound upon her right Leg , which she received by a Pitch-fork when she was a Girl . When the Prisoner was before the Lord-Mayor , among other Questions , he was asked how he came by the Chal ' e again , for it appeared that he brought it home again at Night ? His Answer was , That he left his Wife and the Chaise with another Man at the Monument , who drove away with her , and that he found it again at Night near the same Place , a Boy having brought it thither . Martha Barber . The Deceased lodged at my House between three or four Months ; on the 10th of October she went out about eight o'Clock in the Morning , and came home about 10 and 11 , and borrowed a Hood , a Cloak , and an Apron , to go out again in ; but as she did not come Home all that Night , I got Mrs. Lamb to go to Mr. Coke 's , to enquire if the Prisoner had seen her ; he sent me Word he had not den her , but if she ow 'd me any Thing , he would come and make Satisfaction . The Deceased having told me when she went out , that she was going to meet her Husband , who was come that Morning out of Kent by the Hoy , I sent to the Master of the Hoy , and found that she had met him that Morning . I was uneasy about my Hood and Cloak , but the next Afternoon ( Tuesday ) the same Hood and Cloak which I lent the Deceased , was brought Home , with the Letter that has been read , by a Man who said the Parcel came by the Post ; the Apron was found in Mr. Coke 's House after the Prisoner absconded . The Prisoner promised to pay me what his Wife might have left unpaid . Prisoner . I do n't know these People , nor did I ever see them till they charged me with this Fact . Jonas Harris . On Monday October 10. the Deceased came into the Woolpack in Monkwell Street , and called for a Pint of Beer ; I had some Knowledge of her , and so we fell into Discourse . She told me her Husband was that Morning come from Canterbury , and she was waiting for him ; she said he had provided a Place for her at Wandsworth , and was to come and carry her thither in a Chaise . About two o'Clock the Prisoner came to the House , but without the Chaise ; he would not come in , so the Deceased went to the Door , and talked to him for a little while ; then she came again into the House , and he went away ; as soon as he was gone , she told me that her Husband had hired a Chaise , but the Horse wanted Shooing , and that he wou 'd bring the Chaise to the End of the Street , when the Horse was shod , and she was to go to him there when she saw the Chaise . About half an Hour afterwards I saw the Prisoner ( if a Man may swear through the Glass ) in a Blue Livery , answering to the Description that the Deceased had given me , with the Chaise , at the End of Hart Street , near Cripplegate ; as soon as she saw him she started up , and said she must be gone ; and I saw her go down the Street towards him . Mr. Coke . The Prisoner went away in a Blue Livery ; that is the Colour I give . Mr. Harris . When we heard of a Woman being found murdered at Hounslow , I went down with Mr. Barber to view the Body , and I am positive it was the reputed Wife of the Deceased ; she had a particular Mark upon her Arm . Jane Hart . The Prisoner came to our House the 10th of October , between 11 and 12 in the Forenoon , to hire a Horse and Chaise : I told him we had only a Chaise , but I recommended him to Mr. Milling 's for a Horse ; he went and hired the Horse , then he came back and agreed with me for the Chaise ; he gave me but 2s . for it , because he told me he wanted it only to give an Acquaintance an Airing , and should go no farther than Sir Gregory Page 's on Blackheath . He had the Chaise from us between 2 and 3 in the Afternoon , and my Husband help 'd him to put the Horse in it . The Same Night about 12 o'Clock , the Prisoner brought Home the Horse and the Chaise , and I saw my Husband unharness the Horse ; then he desired to know if he could not lie at our House that Night ; but we told him we had People come from Canterbury , and that our Beds were full . The Prisoner said , if they were Canterbury Men he would go and see if he knew any of them , and he went into the Rooms where they were ; but not knowing any of them , he said he would go Home to his Master 's House . William Hart . The Prisoner paid me 2s . for the Chaise , and Mr. Millings at the Three Colts , had 4s . for the Horse ; I saw him drive away , and when he returned with the Horse and Chaise at 12 o'Clock at Night , I told him he had been a long while at Blackheath ; I have been further ( says he ) I have been at Dartford . Have you , says I ? then the Horse has had a bloody hard Job of it , to go so far in so little Time , when the Roads are so very bad . The Horse had sweated much , but the Sweat was dry 'd upon him when he came Home . Jane Prosser . On the 10th of October in the Morning , the Deceased came to my Master Coke 's House , to know if her Husband was come from Canterbury ; when she heard that he was expected that Day by the Hoy , she said she would go down and meet him at the Hoy . About 11 o'Clock she returned to our House , and told us he was come , and she had got his Bread and Cheese , and the Dram that his Mistress had given him , in case he should be sick , and she could not stay at all with us , because he had appointed her to meet him some where by Wood Street , to carry her to see a Place which he had provided for her . I asked her if she would go with him , when she knew he had attempted to poison her ? Yes , says she , I will , I neither love him nor fear him . I desired her to let me hear from her , and she told me she could , and that if I did not see her next Morning , or before Noon , I might depend upon it she was kill 'd ; then she went away . Between 12 and 1 o'Clock that Night , the Prisoner came Home to my Master 's House , and complained that his Back aked very much , and he wished he had had the Dram that his Mistress had given him ; but ( says he ) I left it behind me at a Publick House . Upon that I asked him if he had not seen his Wife ? No , says he , as God 's my Judge , I have not seen her since I parted with her at my Uncle 's : I have had two Children by her , but I have parted with her . While we were talking , a Woman knocked at the Door and enquired for him . He took her into the Laundry , as she passed along , I heard her say , - Why , when did you see her ? Hearing this , I went into the Laundry , and asked her , if she did not come to enquire after George 's ( the Prisoner 's ) Wife , or Sister ? ( as he call 'd her . ) Yes , she told me she did , and asked me if she did not come there last Night . I told her she did not , and would have had more Discourse with her , but the Prisoner was too intent upon getting her out of Doors , so I followed her , and overtaking her , I took her to the Three-Tun Alehouse ; I asked her what the Prisoner had said concerning the Deceased ? Why ( says she ) he says she is none of his Wife , and what can any body do to him then ? But must the Woman be murdered , says I , because she is not his Wife ? I am resolved I will go down to the Hoy , and enquire what Time she was there ; and accordingly , I took my Master 's Brother 's Man with me , and we went down to the Hoy , and heard the Deceased had been there to enquire for the Prisoner ; then we went home and acquainted our People with what we had done , and we went directly to Mrs. Lamb 's and enquired for the Prisoner ; we found him there , and I asked him if he had found his Sister ? ( as he used to call her . ) No , says he , nor d - n her , do I intend to look after her . I told him I had been at the Hoy , and that he come from thence at 11 o'Clock , and I asked him where he had been from that Time , 10 12 or 1 o'Clock that Night ? He said he had been to see a Play at Drury-Lane Playhouse . From Mrs. Lamb 's he came Home with me , and as we came along together , he told me I had taken a great deal of Pains about the Deceased , and he would make me amends . I had the Letter that was sent Mr. Barber , with the Hood and Cloak at the same Time about me , and upon comparing it with one the Prisoner sent me , about a Week after he absconded , I do believe it to be his own Hand-writing . This is a Cap , Handkerchief , and Apron ( shewing them to the Court ) which my Master 's Brother 's Man found in my Presence ( after the Prisoner was run away ) in a Place where he lock 'd up the Plate . We were forced to open the Lock , because he was gone away with the Key in his Pocket , and there we found these Things . Mrs. Barber . I believe this is the Apron I lent the Deceased , but this Handkerchief I am positive to . Prosser . I taxed the Prisoner with having seen her that Morning , and he then told me positively he had not , and that if he ever did see her again , he would shoot her . But when he was examined before the Lord-Mayor , he confessed that he took her from Wood Street , and delivered her at the Monument to a Stranger , and if she was killed , he supposed it was for the Sake of a Guinea which he had given her to buy her a Gown to go to her Place in . He likewise owned that he had seen her at Bear Key that Morning , and that he bid her go Home and get a clean Apron , that she might go out with him . Prisoner . Were there any Marks of this Villainy on my Cloaths ? Prosser . No ; only you complained of a Pain in your back . John Taylor . I saw the Prisoner that Day at Mr. Hart 's ; I asked him how he did ? he said he was just come out of the Country , and had a little Business to do , which would prevent his going Home that Night ; he desired me to take no Notice that I had seen him , because he should not go Home before Morning . Prisoner . Did I say punctually that I should not , - or that I only believ 'd I could not go Home till Morning ? Taylor . He said he had a little Business to do , and could not go Home till Morning . Margaret Lamb The Deceased had been at a Town call 'd Sea Salter , and when she came Home she visited me , and told me her Husband was a murthering Rogue , and had a Design upon her ; that he had sent her Physick to take , and it prov 'd to be Savin . She pulled a Letter out of her Pocket and shewed it me at that Time , it was to desire her to lodge at Clerkenwell , and not to go near any of her Acquaintance . Another Letter was produced , directed to Jane Prosser , at Mr. Coke 's . Mr. Coke . This I take to be the Prisoner 's Hand-writing . My dear Fellow-Servant , `` I Find how the Villainy has been contrived `` that sent me away , but hope God will provide `` for me . She met me at Bear-Key , and I `` was surprized to see her , having parted with her `` before . So , says she , how do you do ? My `` Heart came in my Mouth , and I could make `` her no Answer . Well , says she , if you turn `` me off to seek my Fortune , will you tell me `` good News ? My Resolution is , says I , to have `` no more to say to you . Has the young Man `` had his Shirts ? Yes , says she . Have you got `` a Service in Town , or do you go to your Aunts , `` says I ? I am to have a Nurse-Child from Putney , `` says she , and there is a young Man who `` knows you very well , will help me to the Child , `` but I want Money to pay for a Horse and Chaise `` to carry me thither , and this is the last Time `` I 'll trouble you , says she . I being over-joy 'd `` at that , said , I would hire one for her . She `` said if I would give her the Money , she would `` hire one herself . I thought I should be cheated `` of the Money , so I told her she must stay `` till To-morrow , for I must go home with my `` Master 's Things . It will be too late then , `` says she , and I must go thither to Night . All `` this passed at a Publick House in Tower Street , `` by Mr. Watts 's Academy where I gave her `` the Bread and Cheese which I had in my Basket. `` It was God 's Mercy I had not the Horse `` and Chaise to pay for , but God owed the `` Owner of them better Fortune . 'T is a Scheme `` to take away my Life , because I did design to `` take up and lead a good Life . Give my Duty `` to my Master ; on my Knees I will ask his `` Pardon for leaving his Service ; I trust in God `` he will take me again , and stand my Friend , as `` I am a poor Servant and Friendless . At present `` I am not able to come , I am so bad with `` Pains all over my Body and Head , that I can `` hardly stand ; but I will starve my self , rather `` than spend my Master 's Money . Take my `` Shirts , Dear Jenny , into your Charge , I have `` but few Things , but I hope God will bless me , `` which is all from , Your Unfortunate Fellow Servant , Oct. 17 . 1737 . George Price . P. S `` If you please , shew this Letter to my `` Master , and to all those I owe Money to ; tell `` them with the Help of God , I will pay them `` all I owe , which will not come to 7l . I asked `` her what Time the Man was to come Home `` with her ? She told me , she would have me `` wait . I said , I thought they might be back about `` 10 or 11 o'Clock ; they told me , if they `` did not come back by that Time , they would `` not come 'till next Morning . I said , that I `` would go then to the other End of the Town ; `` but she repeated her Words , that I must not go `` till she saw whether she should have this Child `` or no , and that I must swear I had not seen her. `` I misfortunately promised to say as she desired `` me , it being the last Time that she trouble 'd `` me ; so I went to Drury-Lane , and from thence `` I run to Fishstreet-Hill , where I found a Boy `` leading the Horse and Chaise , who told me , he `` had 6d for bringing them from St. George 's `` Church in Southwark , by a Man who looked `` like a Sailor ; but it was not like the Man that `` went out with her , for he was like a Carpenter. `` The Boy told me , the Man came with him to `` the Foot of the Bridge , then left him , telling `` him , he would meet some body to take the `` Horse from him . I lay 'd down my Dram upon `` a Table , as God is my Judge I never tasted it , `` and you say she got it . She gave me the strictest `` Charge to say , if I chanced to meet any `` Body that knew her , that I had not seen her. `` I did so , but there is a God in Heaven , who by `` some Means or other will right my Cause . At `` present I am Fatherless , Motherless and Friendless. `` I went to look for a Horse that would `` carry double , but I could not find one , so I got `` a Chair , and took her to the Bridge-Foot , where `` I met this Man , whom I never saw before , and I `` asked him , the Reason of his going that Way `` to Putney ? He told me , 't was to save the Expence `` of going over Sir Robert 's Bridge . I gave `` her Half-a-Crown , at the Alehouse in Tower-Street , `` which I suppose she spent ; for before `` she went off , she gave me her Handkerchief , `` Cap and Apron to be wash 'd . '' Prosser This Cap and Apron was found as I have mention 'd , and the Letter was brought me , by a Man who look 'd like a Countryman , and he asked me , if I knew one Jane Prosser ? He told me , it came by the Carrier that comes in at the Old-Change . I shew 'd my Master the Letter , and he kept it 'till this very Day . Mrs. Barber . The Apron was clean when I lent it to her , and the Handkerchief I know she had on , that Morning she went out . Tho Ansol , Surgeon . I was sent for , to view the Body of the Deceased , by Order of Mr. Higgs the Coroner . I found a large Contusion on her Neck , and a large Cut , which entirely separated the Tendon of the Neck , and divided the jugular Vein . Her Nose was likewise slit , and she had a slight Wound above her Eye-Brow . These Wounds were curable , but the others in the Neck were mortal . Tho Scot . On the 10th of October , about a Quarter after 6 in the Evening , I was going over Hounslow-Heath from Work , and I heard a Woman 's Voice , I thought , about 2 or 300 Yards from me . I laid my self down upon the Ground ; for we Country-Folks imagine we can hear any Thing at a Distance , much better in that Posture . I heard the Woman cry , O Lord ! My Dear ! My Dear ! I will never trust you any more , if these are your Favours . The next Day , the Woman was found murdered about 2 or 300 Yards from the Place , where I heard the Voice . Mr. Coke . I had been in Kent all the Summer , and towards the latter End of it , I came up to Town with the Prisoner ; as we came along , he had a Fall from his Horse and hurt himself , so I made him go back , and order 'd him when he was better , to come up by the Hoy . He came Home on the 10th of October , about 12 o'Clock at Night , as I was informed ; I did not see him that Night , for my Brother got out of Bed and let him in . He was angry with him for being late , and to justify himself , he told him , the Hoy was but just arrived ; he told me the same Thing the next Morning . I asked him what was the Reason that he did not lie on Board , as the Hoy was so late ? Sir , ( says he ) I met Mr. Milford 's Man John Taylor , and he told me your Brother and you were out of Town . I thought these Excuses a little odd , for Mr. Midford 's Man had seen him at 12 o'Clock at Noon that Day , and he had desired him to say , he had not seen him at all . However I gave him 3 Guineas to fetch something from Mr. Godfrey 's the Chymist , I knew 't was a costly Thing , and did not know the exact Price ; he brought Home what I sent him for , which cost but 10s . and that Day he absconded with the rest of the Money ; for when I came Home in the Evening , about 6 or 7 o'Clock , I call 'd for him , and my Brother 's Man told me , he went out about 5 or 6 , and said he was coming to me at the Coffee-house ; but he was not return 'd , and he believ 'd he would come no more ; from that Time he never came to my Service . The next Day he wrote me a Penny Post Letter , telling me therein that he was over Head and Ears in Debt ; that he must go to Sea , and that he dare not shew his Head . He pretended he ran away for Debt , but in that long Letter to Prosser , which has been read , he says , all his Debts in the World were but 7l . 4 Guineas of which he owes my Brother 's Man , who would never have troubled him for it . I have told you the Excuse , he made to me and my Brother for coming Home so late , was , the Hoy was but just arriv 'd ; but the Reason he gave to Prosser was , that he had been at Drury-Lane Playhouse . Francis Heath I belong to Mr. Fleetwood , Master of Drury-Lane Play-house . This is the Book we keep our Accounts in . On the 10th of October last , there was no Play acted there at all . The Prisoner 's Defence . My Lord , I declare I am entirely innocent of all that is laid to my Charge ; and I am so far from knowing any Thing of the Murder of my Wife , that I can take a solemn Oath , I know nothing at all of it . 'T is very plain , my Lord , that there is a Scheme of Villainy laid before you , but when I lay the manner of its Contrivance before you , I make no Doubt but you will think so too . My Wife I lov 'd as I do my own Life ; I marry 'd her for nothing else , and indeed she merited all my Love , being a vertuous , sober , good Woman . If she was not so frugal in the Management of what little we had , it was our Misfortune only . I hope your Lordship and the Jury will put a charitable Construction on my leaving my Master 's Service . You will find I did not , without good Reason , and that I am not the Villain I have been represented . If I was , I think I should never have had the Confidence to have look 'd your Lordship and the Jury in the Face . I have no Friend but God to be my Councellor , and Innocency must be my Defence . And I believe several People now in Court have Reason to think I speak the Truth . I think they have now discharg 'd their Duty to the King ; - now let them declare , whether they think I deserve some of my Wife 's Speeches I have taken Pains to preserve her Life , - never any to destroy it . If any of them can say I ever misused her , than let me suffer Blame , but till then , I hope your Lordship will hear my Cause . Ask Mrs. Lamb in what manner I used this Woman , - this Wife of mine ? Mrs. Lamb . He used her very well . In a Fit of Sickness she had , he fetch 'd his Master 's Apothecary to her , and desir 'd him to discharge his Conscience to her , and make her well . When she did not take her Medicines , the Prisoner would blame her . He paid her Lodging and her Nurse . I know no Fault in him ; how this happen 'd I can not tell . Counc . How long is it since the Deceased had this Fit of Sickness ? Mrs. Lamb . About 7 or 8 Months ago . I am not sure whether the Apothecary is paid or not . Prisoner . He is not paid : This is his Bill . Pray call Mrs. Sherwin , and ask her where I spent the Evening on Monday the 10th of October ? Mrs. Sherwin . I remember nothing of it . There is a Woman under Misfortune in Newgate , and I went with an elderly Man to see her . While I was there , a Breviate was wrote out , by which I was to clear the Prisoner . I was to say , that he and his Wife were with me at Supper that Night , and I was to be well paid for my Trouble . This is the Paper of Instructions which I received from the Prisoner , and thus far ( pointing to the middle of the Sheet of Paper ) he wrote himself . I was carried to Newgate by this elderly Man , to do Service for somebody , - I did not know who ; when I came there , I found 't was for the Prisoner , and was to be paid for doing it , but I do n't desire to get Money at such a Rate . The Paper was read. `` My Lord , On Monday October the 10th , `` about 9 o'Clock in the Morning , Mrs. Price `` came to my House in Aldersgate-Street , and `` drank Tea with me . She told me she was going `` to see a Place , but that she must stay 'till `` her Husband came to London , ( which would be `` that Day ) because she wanted Money . She `` told me he would be surpriz 'd to see her , for `` at Canterbury she told him , she would send him `` Word when she got a Place , or else she would `` go to her Aunts . She asked me to go to Bear-Key `` with her , to see if her Husband was come `` up ; I told her I could not go with her , but I `` would come after her , and she was to stay for `` me at the Cock Ale-house in Tower-street . I `` went out a little before 2 o'Clock , and met the `` Prisoner and his Wife , in Tower-street . He `` had with him a Parcel ty 'd up in a Paper , and `` a Twig Basket with Pidgeons in it , which he `` said he was going to make a Present of to his `` Master Lanes I heard her tell her Husband , `` that she had heard of a Service in the Country , `` and if he would get her a Horse , she had a `` Person ready to go with her in the Evening . He `` said , his Master would lend him Money , and `` therefore she should not go to her Place while `` he staid in Town , and she should have half the `` Money . He said he had some Business to do , `` and must go , but he would meet us again at the `` King's-head Ale-house in Clement 's Lane . We `` went there and drank a pint of Two-penny , `` then he return 'd to us , and told us he was disappointed `` of Money , but he would get a Horse `` for her , or a Chaise ; which she consented to , `` and complaining of the poorness of her Cloaths , `` the Prisoner took out of his Pocket a Guinea `` and a 6 d , and said , if he could get that chang 'd , `` he would pay for the Chaise , and give her `` the remainder of the Money . I told him , if `` he would give his Wife the whole Guinea , I `` would lend him 10 s. to pay for the Chaise , `` which I did , and am not paid to this Day. `` The Deceased then order 'd her Husband to `` bring the Chaise to the Wool pack in Monkwell `` street , and charg 'd him to tell his Fellow-Servants `` that she was gone into the Country , and `` had been there some Time ; and she desir 'd him `` to deny that he had seen her . All this I heard `` her say to him . While he was gone to see `` for a Chaise , a Man came to the Deceased , `` and she went out to see after her Husband . At `` 3 o'Clock she return 'd to the Man , and the `` Prisoner with her in a Chaise . I saw the Man `` and she go away together in the Chaise , and `` the Prisoner ask 'd the Man what was the `` Meaning of his going over the Bridge to Putney ? `` The Man reply 'd , it was to save the Expence `` of Putney Bride , and promised to be back about `` 11 o'clock , the Prisoner said he would meet `` him to take the Horse and Chaise , if he did `` not exceed that Time ; if he should , he begg 'd `` the Man would put them up at the Star-Inn , `` and he would fetch them from thence . He `` gave his Wife half a Crown at parting to bear `` her Expences , and kissed her . Sherwin . These were my Instructions , and this was what I was to swear here : I received this Paper from the Prisoner Yesterday Morning , I had it to peruse often over ; it is Part of a Play which I was to act here , and was to be paid very handsomely for performing my Part . Mary Pennistone gave an Account that the Deceased lodged with her three Quarters of a Year ; that she had 2 Children in her House , that she went from her House last Christmas was 12 Months , and that during the Time she lived with her , the Prisoner used her well . Mary Sale deposed to the same Effect . Mary Finch . I knew the Deceased before she married the Prisoner ; she lodged in my House , and was with Child by him , and she was delivered of 2 Children three Doors from where I live ; I nursed them for some Time , and parted with them last Whitsunday . He and she have dined with me three Days together , and I saw nothing but that he used her well . He paid me for nursing the Children to a Farthing , at the White . Horse in Bond-street . He was civil to the Children , and never came empty-handed , without Biscakes , or half a Pint of Wine for them , but I ca n't tell what 's become of them now . Councel . Do you know what Month it was when he paid you ? Finch I ca n't tell . Councel . Was it May or June ? Finch . I do n't know . John Johnson gave an Account , that the Prisoner on Monday November the 5th , sent for him to the Bear and Harrow Tavern , and told him he surrendered himself to him , and desired to be carried before a Magistrate ; that in St. Clement 's Church-Yard , he left the Prisoner to go Home for his Hat , that he found him there again , and that they went directly to Mr. Coke 's ; that the Maids there were afraid they were come to murder them , and call 'd in some of the Neighbour 's Servants , that when the Constable came , he was not willing to take Charge of the Prisoner , till some Threats were used to him ; that the Prisoner said before the Lord Mayor , he had hired a Chaise for his Wife and a Man had drove away with her in Gracechurch-street , who was an Acquaintance of hers , and that he had the Chaise again from a Link-Boy about Eleven o'Clock , at the Monument . Prisoner . As soon as I parted with my Wife at the Monument , a Man told me he believed I did not know him ; but , says he , that 's my Friend who is gone with your Wife , and if you 'll go with me this Evening , I 'll treat you ; I thought I must oblige him , because he and his Friend had helped my Wife to a Service , so I went with him to Drury-Lane Playhouse , and there being no Play acted there that Night , we went to Covent-Garden , and saw Volpone , or The Fox , with the Entertainment of the Mock Doctor . Guilty . Death . 13 , 14. John Margets and William Ifield , were indicted for assaulting Isabel Coates , in the King 's Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Hoop-Petticoat , value 2 s. 6 d. December the 27th . Isabel Coates . The 27th of December I was going from Golden-Lane to Islington , between 2 and 3 in the Morning , and I met the Prisoners at the Bar ; one of them laid hold of the Hoop I had in my Hand , and told me I had stole it ; I thought they would murder me , so I cry 'd out , but Margets held my Head in his Bosom to prevent the Noise ; then they threw me down in the Kennel and ran away , I ran after them , and Margets seeing me pursue them , came back and pretended to assist me , and I gave him good Words to get him to the Watch-house ; by these good Words I got him near the Watch-house , then I collar 'd him , and called a Watchman to take Charge of him , for he was the Fellow that held me while the others robbed me . This was a little Way from the Watch-house in Brick-Lane . Margets at first denied the Fact , but he afterwards confessed it , and he owned it likewise before the Justice . I am very positive to them both . Mr. Justice Wroth . Ifield sent me a Letter , and begged he might come and make his Information before me . While he was in Goal , the other Prisoner Margets ( who was likewise taken ) desired he might make his Information too . Middlesex , to wit . The Examination of William Ifield , & c. Who says , `` That on Tuesday Morning , the `` 27th of December , between 2 and 3 o'Clock , `` he , with John Margets , and one Barnet , stopp 'd `` a Woman in Brick-Lane , and took from her a `` Hoop-Petticoat , which she had under her `` Arm , & c. - Dated Jan. 3 . The rest of the Information related to other Facts . Middlesex , to wit . The Examination of John Margets , & c. Who says , `` That about 2 or 3 o'Clock on `` Tuesday , the 27th of December , he , with William. `` Ifield , and a Person whose Name is unknown `` to this Deponent , stopped a Woman in `` Brick-Lane , and robbed her of a Hoop Coat , `` which she had under her Arm . Mr. Justice Wroth . They were both brought before me at the same Time , but I examin 'd them separately . Samuel Puden . I heard the Prisoners confess this Fact before the Justice . John Pyke . Margets was brought into the Watch-house the 27th of December , and he deny 'd this Robbery ; but as we were carrying him to New-Prison , he said if I would let him go , he would help the Woman to her Hoop again . Margets . I took the Woman 's Part , and came with her to the Watch-house ; when we came there , she charged me with the Robbery . I was playing with some Bottles when the Woman was robbed . I never touch 'd her Ifield . He and I had been drinking , and we went out together . It was Barnet robbed the Woman . Guilty . Death . They were a second Time indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-House of Samuel Puden , about 2 in the Night , and stealing three Holland Shirts , value 12 s. four Shirts , value 10 s. two Aprons , value 2 s. a Diaper Clout , value 6 d. a Linnen Handkerchief , value 6 d and a Loyn of Veal , and other Things . Dec. 24 . Samuel Puden . Between 2 and 3 in the Morning of Christmas-Day , my House was broke open , the Pin of the Window was pulled out , and the window-Shutter was taken down . The 2 Prisoners both owned the Fact , and signed their Confessions . I ca n't swear to the Prisoners , but I lost all the Things mentioned in the Indictment , and I heard them confess they broke into my House and stole them . Mr. Justice Wroth proved the Confessions , and deposed , that two Prisoners signed them at their own Desires . Their Confessions were read in Court , and the Prisoners having nothing to say in their Defence , the Jury found them Guilty . Death . 15. John Birt , was indicted for assaulting John Berry in a certain Field , near the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him 12 s. Jan. 9 . John Berry . This Day Se'nnight I had been in the Country with Wild Fowl , and about 6 o'Clock at Night , I was coming Homewards thro ' Islington , where I lit of the Prisoner and another Man , who came along with me thro ' the Town , past the Bear-Garden House , and thro ' the Posts , in the Way to the London Spaw ; as we came along this Field , one of the Men asked me what Goods I had Sold ? I told them , I had no Money , but one of them laid hold of me , and the Prisoner put his Hand into my Pocket , I told them I hop 'd they would not rob a poor Man : they told me they made no Exception , and so they threw me down ; the Prisoner stopp 'd my Mouth with Dirt , then they ty 'd my Legs together . I cry 'd out , but no body heard . The Prisoner struck me over the Arm with his Stick ; I cry 'd out louder , and then they both run away . When they were gone , I got forward as well as I could with my Legs ty 'd , and knocked at this Man 's Door , begging him to let me in : this other Man , cut the String from my Legs , then they fetch 'd me some Water to clean me . I staid there 'till almost 7 o'Clock , then I went Home . The next Night , I was going Home with some Folks from a Christening , and I saw the Prisoner at Drury Lane Playhouse . I told Mr. Fisher the Constable of it , and the next Day he went with me to see if we could find him at the same Place : but as we were going up Fleet-street , I saw the Prisoner and seized him ; telling him , he was the Man that robb 'd me . We carry 'd him before Justice Poulson , and the Justice asked him what Account he could give of himself ? He told him , that he liv 'd by picking Pockets , and had done so these 2 Years , at Drury-Lane Playhouse . The Prisoner put his Hand into my Pocket ; I endeavour 'd to resist , upon which the other pull 'd me down Backwards , and then they took 12 s. from me . Prisoner . I never saw him , but when he came to disorderly Houses with the Thief-takers . I shall bring Witnesses to prove , I was at the Bull-Head Alehouse in Sharp's-Alley , Cow-Cross , when this Fact was committed . John Cooper and John Dutton gave an Account of the Prosecutor 's knocking at Mr. Cooper 's Door , in a dirty Pickle ; they deposed , that his Legs were ty 'd , and that he told them , he had been robb 'd in the Manner , as above related . Jury . How could the Prosecutor remember the Prisoner 's Face ? We apprehend it must be dark when he was robb 'd . Berry . They came from the Three Calves , all the Way thro ' Islington with me , Check by Jowl ; and there was a Boy with a Link came along with us about an hundred Yards of the Way . Prisoner . I have not been in the Fields , since last Welch Fair , and this Night I was in Sharp's-Alley . Berry . The House that he speaks of ( in Sharp's-Alley ) is a House the Thieves make use of . When the Prisoner was taken , he did not pretend then , that he was at this Bull Head in Sharp's-Alley that Night . Prisoner . I am Innocent ; I was then drinking at Mr. Wallis 's , the Bull-Head , in Sharp's-Alley . William Fisher , Constable . I was with the Prosecutor at the taking the Prisoner . Before Justice Poulson , he said he was a Cabinet-maker by Trade , but he had follow 'd picking Pockets at Playhouses these 2 Years . The Justice told him 't was a very bad Trade , and committed him . Prisoner . And so because I am a Person of hardly a low Character , they would swear my Life away . Berry . I never swore against any Body before in my Life . Sarah Wallis . The Prisoner came to this House in Sharp's-Alley , this Day Se'nnight ( 't is the Bull and Last ) I did keep the House my self , but I live there now . The Man that I have let the House to , went out that Afternoon , and I look 'd after it for him 'till he came back . The Prisoner was there from between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , 'till 9 at Night . He had no Company with him , but drank 2 Pints of Ale by himself , and had a Penn'orth of Bread and Cheese . Jury . Does she remember the Prisoner 's being there , at any other Time ? Wallis . No - He was there Wednesday Night , Tuesday Night and Sunday Night ; and I remember 't was a wet Night , that Monday , because the Man that keeps the House could not come Home 'till past 11 o'Clock . Samuel Bellinger . I know no Harm of the Prosecutor , only I heard him say before last Sessions , that he would have a Man or two by next Patter , I suppose he meant , before next Sessions . I am a Mathematical Instrument-Maker , and no House-keeper ; I live with my Mother . This Discourse I heard in Rosemary-Lane , where he and I and others were drinking , and he said at that Time , that he had been robb 'd ( I think ) 3 Months ago , near Moorfields , of 3 s. 6 d. or thereabouts . I know nothing of the Prisoner 's being a Pick pocket ; I never saw him before , but being at the Queen 's Head in the Old-Bailey , I happen 'd to say , I heard Berry speak these Words ; so they brought me into Court . Edward Driver gave the Prosecutor the Character of an honest Man , and that it was his Opinion he would not forswear himself . Justice Poulson : When the Prisoner was before me , he deny 'd the Fact , but he told me , he had liv 'd for these a Years last past , entirely by picking Pockets , and nothing else : I asked him of what ? And he told me of Handkerchiefs only . That House in Sharp's-Alley has a bad Character . Another Witness gave the Prosecutor the Character of an honest Man . Guilty . Death 16 . 17.

Immediately 2 Men more came up with Pistols , and I think 't was the Man that stopp 'd me first - he felt for my Watch . One of the others laid hold of my Hand , in which I had my Cane and Hanger , which they bid me deliver , or else I should be a dead Man . I had 3 Pistols about me at once . When the first Man had got my Watch , he felt in my Fob , but found no Money there . Then he felt in my left Pocket , and took out 5 s. and 6 d. and the others disputed who should have my Cane and Hanger . D - mn it , says one , I 'll have his Shoe-buckles . One of them ( who insisted on my having my Cane and Hanger again ) told the other , he should not take my Buckles , and this ( favourable ) Man , presented his Pistol to him who swore he would have the Buckles , and said , if he took them he would shoot him . They asked me what I had got in my right Breeches Pocket , and in my Coat Pocket ? I told them - nothing but a Handkerchief and a black snuff-box : Immediately upon that , one of them cry 'd ! - Who 's a coming ! And away they all went towards London , but before they went off , they return 'd me my Cane and Hanger . I stood still to look after them , but one of them came back , and said - d - mn you Sir , go along toward Holloway .

John Parrot and Tom Oliver were of our Company , but they did not come up . White , Will . Parrot , and I robb 'd him . The Watch we valu 'd , and every Thing was equally divided among us all , at John Parrot 's House , the Bell and Boy , an Ale-house in Brick Lane Sometime before this we robb 'd Mr. Ellington ( a Watch-maker ) at Hackney , of a Watch , a Guinea , and some Silver . Oliver and I have been acquainted ever since Midsummer , and 't is unknown what we have got every Night . When we robb 'd Mr. Holst , 't was Moon-light , and I believe it might be about 8 o'Clock . We lay at the Prisoner Parrot 's House that Night , three in a Bed , and he was then as well as I am . We were 7 of us that used to go out ; that Night 5 only were abroad . Grafton Kirk , who was one of our Company , had a Fancy for this Gentleman 's Watch , and he offer 'd 3 l for it . Levi Lemster . Mr. Harris having a Warrant against Oliver , we took him at Sam Baker 's in Milk-Yard . He resisted very much , and 3 Men try 'd to rescue him , his Wife attempted to cut one of us down the Back .

The Night this Gentleman was robb 'd , Waterman and 2 more came into my House , the Queen's-Head and Green-Man at lower Holloway . They had a Pot of Beer , and rose up in a Hurry , and threw down 6 d. telling me they would call for the Change another Time . About half an Hour after they were gone , Mr. Holst came up , and said he had been robb 'd . John Bellenger . ( The Witness in the Trial of Bell ) I know both the Prisoners , and have been at Parrot 's House in Brick-Lane , where I have seen them both Oliver I have seen likewise at the Queen 's Arms in East Smithfield , at Cock-fighting . I was at the taking of Oliver ; we had a great Fight with him before we secur 'd him , and he endeavour 'd to make his Escape . His Wife endeavour 'd to cut me in the Back with a Case-Knife , and I broke her Head for it . I thought the Money he betted a Cocking , did not come by Shoemaking . Serjeant Bell was call 'd by Parrot 's Councel to give some Account of the Evidence Waterman 's vowing Revenge against him , ( Parrot ) but his Evidence was not to that Purpose . Sam Morland was Parrot 's Butcher , and he paid him for his Meat . Sarah Woldridge deposed , that Parrot was so full of Pain the 27th of Sept. that he walk 'd with a Stick , and went to Bed between a 11 and 12 at Night ; that he was ill of a Kick he had receiv 'd in his Groin , and that she staid with him , because he was in Affliction . That she had seen Waterman . 5 Times there ; and she remember 'd the 27th of Sept. because Spittle fields Market was to be open 'd 2 Days after .

The 27 th of Sept. near 7 o'Clock in the Evening , I was going over the Bridge towards Holloway , and a Man came up to me with a Pistol , and said , - Sir , I want your Money . Immediately 2 more came behind me with Pistols in their Hands . Then they took my Money , and because my Watch came out hard , they threatn 'd to shoot me if I did not undo my Breeches . They took my Watch with a Packthread String , 3 Guineas , and about 22 or 23 s. from me , with a French Crown , which was among the Silver . The Prisoner was the first Man that stopp 'd me , the other two I do not know . I heard the Prisoner was taken , so I went to see him in Newgate , the Beginning of this Month , and knew him to be the Man that stopp 'd me . I tax 'd him with the Fact , and he own 'd it , and told me the Watch was at Endfield , and the French Crown was at the House where he used to lie . Prisoner . I would ask him whether he knew me before I told him the manner in which I robb 'd him ? Wheeler . Yes , I knew him when I first saw him in Newgate ; I did not know of any Information he had made then . Mr. Holst . The Prisoner made his Information a Fortnight or three Weeks ago , before Mr. Justice Chamberlain , and I believe Wheeler knew little of the Prisoner , till I gave him the Intelligence , for I asked him next Morning , if he should know any of the Men again ? and he told me , his Surprize was so great when the Pistols came about him , that he verily believ 'd he should not know any of them again . About a Fortnight or three Weeks ago , I sent Wheeler a Letter to let him know , the Prisoner had made his Information of this Robbery , and several others , and that he was accepted as an Evidence by Mr. Chamberlain , but I saw nothing of him , till last Tuesday I met him at Hicks's-Hall , and he told me he had preferr 'd his Bill against the Prisoner . I told him it was a wrong Step he had taken ; and he said , he should be glad to have the Prisoner admitted an Evidence , and that he would prefer another Bill against the other two . Guilty .

No , says Gardiner , we have had a Sleep since we blue the Candle out . I felt the Candle , and found the Wick hot , and the Tallow warm ; upon which I got a Constable , and two or three Watchmen ; the Prisoners had no Money at all when they went to Bed , but the Watchmen found all the Money which was in the Club-box , upon them , except one crooked Sixpence which was found in the Bed . The Box wherein the Money , the Bond , and Note was lock 'd , was in a Closet in the Room where they lay , and the Key of their Chamber opened that Closet . I saw the Box whole in that Closet the same Afternoon , and am positive nobody had been in the Room from that Time till they went to Bed .

The two Watchmen gave the same Account . George Alderson proved the Money , Note , and Bond being in the Box , under two Locks , the Property of the Society . Mr. Davis and the Clerk of the Society , proved the Property likewise ; and that the Bond was then unsatisfied , and the Note also , when the Fact was committed . The Prisoners had little to say in their Defence , and the Jury found them Guilty upon the first Indictment . Death . The Evidence upon the second Indictment was much to the same Purport as in the former Trial , only some of the Witnesses deposed , that the two Pieces of Gold were found in a Purse , with a Leaden Shilling in the Chimney , the next Morning ; all which were sworn to have been in the Box , and were the Property of the Society .

That upon turning the Body ( to look for the Occasion of the Rupture of that diseased Vessel ) he saw a large Bruise , which tally 'd with the internal Rupture , and was directly over it , but as it was 3 Days after her Death , that he view 'd the Body , he could not exactly judge how long it might be since the Blow or Kick , which occasion 'd that Bruise , was given , but he believ 'd the Deceased might have receiv 'd it within 5 Days , and was given with great Violence .
