The first Evidence was one John Cole , who deposed , That the Prisoner was at a Musick-house at Ratcliffe , in company with the Bar keeper , and in comes Mr. Morrison , who asked Mrs. Mortimer for a Ring of his . She reply 'd she had none of it ; then he told the Prisoner that he had it , and had pawn 'd it at the Crown Tavern in Wapping ; and that he would have it before he went , or else he would do the Prisoner a mischief . Upon that Mr. R - drew his Sword , and run at Mr. Morrison through the Door-way , then Morrison went into the Room to Mr. R - and fell upon him , having no Weapon but a Cane , and fought with Mr. R - and beat him , till he made him cry out Murther . The Prisoner desired Cole might be asked , Whether he did not see the Deceased to assault the Prisoner in the Room , and throw him on the Couch . The Evidence answer 'd , he did . The next Evidence for the King , was a Lad of about 16 years of age , who declared , that the beginning of this Accident was on this manner : Some time since a Gentleman coming to drink in the House , not having money , left a Ring with Mr. Morrison that then was a Drawer in the said House , which Ring Morrison wore on his Finger . Mrs. Mortimer the Bar-keeper seeing him wear it , did ask him for it , and he , in a jesting manner , held out his Finger , and Mrs. Mortimer took it from him , keeping it some time ; and afterwards going abroad with Captain G - R - the Priner , she let him have it . Some time after the Gentleman that owned the Ring , went to Morrison the Deceased , and demanded it . Morrison then being gone from the place , and living in another Service , took occasion one day to go to his old Masters for the Ring , where he found Captain R - talking with Mrs. Mortimer the Bar-keeper , whom he asked for the Ring . She told him she had it not , but that Captain R - had it , ( and some body there said , that R - had pawn 'd it to a Broker for 5 s. ) then the Deceased asked R - for it , and he said he had it not , and would not give it him , for he ow 'd him nothing . Upon which , rough words arose between them , and R - drew his Sword , which Morrison fended off with his Cane , and immediately Morrison was wounded , as aforesaid , of which Wound the Chyrurgion made Oath that he languished , and within three days died . Then Thomas Harris the Lad stood up again , and the Court asked him , Whether he saw the Wound given ? He answer 'd , That Harrison put off the first Passes with his Cane , but afterwards he saw R - stab theDeceased with a Sword . Then the Prisoner called Mrs. Mortimer , who gave a very favourable Report of him , yet owning all the matter of the Ring , saying the Captain had it from her . Then Mrs. Baker stood up , saying , That Mrs. Mortimer had no need to give him the Ring , for the Captain had a Wife , and Mrs. Mortimer was but his Mistress . The Captain made a notable Defence , if he could have proved what he alledged . Then he called divers Persons as to his Reputation , some of whom were of good Quality : But the Brother of the Deceased having divers credible Persons to confront them with some former Actions , he desisted , and none were heard as to that matter on either side . So after a long Hearing , his Lordship proceeded to give the Charge , and the Jury brought him in guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] Ann Charlton the Mistress , and Elizabeth Taylor the Maid , were both tried for stealing from John Mitchell Gent . three Diamonds , value 3 l. 140 Twenty shilling pieces of Coined Gold , value 140 l. which was done the 6th of September last . Mr. Mitchell swore that he lost his money out of his Trunk , and they lodged in the House at the time when the money was lost , but he could not charge them to have stole it . He looking into his Trunk again some few days after , he found some Diamonds that were left , but the Gold was gone , and they both left their Lodgings , which gave a Suspition upon them , and never came any more , but were in some small time after taken . There was found three Guinea 's upon Taylor , and one Diamond upon Ann Charlton ; but Mr. Mitchell did not swear they were his Goods , and Mrs. Charlton said she was under some ill Circumstances , being in Debt , made her leave her Lodging so soon . She produced Witnesses for her good Reputation , so they were both acquitted . William Ross , and Isabella his Wife , and Isabella his Wife , were both Tried for High Treason in Clipping the Currant Coin , & c The Prisoners House being search 'd on the 7th of September last , there was found in the Garret 3 Pair of Shears , and in the Yard buried under a board in an Earthen Pot was found some Weights , and a little Bag of Clipping ; and in a Purse about Mrs. Ross was found 13 or 14 Shillings that were newly clipt ; and in another Purse was found a little Piece of Clipping , and a few Filings of Silver & c. There was nothing suspicious found upon Mr Ross ; and the Kings Evidence said further , That they were informed , that the Woman used to Clip when her Husband was at the Brewhouse , he being a Tub-man . There was nothing affected Mr Ross ; and his Wife said she knew not how the things came into the House ; and that one Wood lodged in her House , who she lately prosecuted for killing her Son-in-Law , and he vow 'd Revenge upon her . She called abundance of her Neighbours , very substantial persons , who all gave a very good account of both their Reputations , that they were very Laborious People . They were both acquitted . Anthony Demeany , Mary Demeany his Wife , John Santrey and Claud Santrey his Wife , were all Tried for stealing a Silver Tankard , val . 5 l. 10 s. from Mr John Roberts . The Prisoners were all drinking at Roberts 's House , and in a Cupboard in the Room where they were , there was a Silver Tankard , which was missing before they all went away ; only Santrey and his Wife went away , and came again afterwards . They had good Witness to their Credit , and the Evidence could not be positive , so they were all acquitted . Katherine Stephens was Tried for stealing a Flanders-Lace Head-dress val . 4 l an Apron 10 s. a Lace-Crevat , and divers other goods of value , from William Southerne , who swore , That the Prisoner was his Servant in April last , and that she robbed him of the Goods aforesaid , which she confest to have sold in Duck-Lane for 5 s. where they were found . The Prisoner in her Defence at the Trial alledg 'd , That she being a poor Countrey Girl , and not able to speak for her self they laid this Felony to her Charge . Southerne had his Goods again , so she was only found guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] Frances Randall was Indicted for Clipping the King 's Coin ; but the Evidence for the King and Queen not appearing against her , she was acquitted . Thomas Davis was also Arraigned for High Treason in Cutting , Clipping , Filing , and Diminishing the Currant Coin of the Kingdom ; but the Evidence against him was Mary Shepherd his Servant , whom he Indicted for robbing him , as in the next Trial ; so he swore against her now , but could prove nothing , so she was acquitted . Mary Shepherd , before Tried on London-side , was now again Arraigned for robbing Thomas Davis of a Mantua Gown val . 25 s. a Petticoat 20 l. 2 Holland Aprons , & c. Davis said that she was his Servant , and robbed him of the Gown , which was found upon her back ; but the Prisoner said his Wife gave it her , and Mr. Davis could not prove the contrary , so she was Acquitted , as in the preceding Trial . Jonathan Hunt , and Elizabeth Hunt his Wife , both tried for stealing Six Pound and Fourteen Ounces of dy 'd Silk , value 6 l. 10 s. But the Evidence being only Circumstantial , they were acquitted . Richard Latchfeild Sollicitor at Law was tried , for that he , together with William Ballendyne and William Belwood , did endeavour to cheat Mr. Alexander Rood and Mr. Richard Conyers , Goldsmith s of London , of divers Pieces of Plate of great Value . Mr. Bellandine came to them and agreed for the Plate , for the Payment of which there was a Bill drawn upon Belwood , who lived then in Abchurch Lane , but is since gone aside , and the Money is not paid . The Evidence was not full enough to find the said Latchfield Guilty , tho he was suspected to have acted more than became an Honest Man in the Concern . So he was Acquitted of the Misdemeanor .
