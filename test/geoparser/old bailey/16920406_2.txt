As soon as he came in , lie asked , how poor Mrs. Vanwick did ; says he , she hath been wronged of Five Hundred Pounds within this 12 Months : Then I let him into the Court , and he went into her Chamber ; and about half an Hour after , I was sent by my Master , to require some Chamber-Rent of Mrs. Vanwick , and I heard Mr. Harrison and she at high Words , and in a great Passion , and I heard Mr. Harrison Swear , God damn his Blood , he would be reveng 'd of that Rogue , and named Clenche or Winch , I can not tell which , and he would have his Blood , e 're it were long .

Who was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Mr. Humston , I desire you will give the Court an Account ; of Mr Harrison 's being at your House , that Night Dr. Clenche was Murdered . Mr. Humston . My Lord , I met Mr. Harrison on Monday the 4th of January last , and he told me , he was going to the Compter , to a Gentlewoman that was much oppressed , and that he wanted Money to get her Released ; upon which , I gave him some Money , and after some Discourse , I desired him to bring home my Gown , that I formerly lent him , and seemed angry with him , for that he had several times promised me to bring it home , but had failed therein ; and thereupon he promised , that I should have it that Night : And that Evening about Nine of the Clock , he came to my Lodgings , and brought home my Gown , and when he came , I asked him , if he had gotten Mrs. Vanwick Released : And Mr. Harrison answered , No . Upon which , I blamed him for neglecting an old Friend , and Mr. Harrison excused it ; telling me , that he had met with some Persoms upon earnest Business which prevented him . And then I asked Mr. Harrison to stay and Sup with me , but he refused it , saying , that he had been about extraordinary Business that Day , which must be done that Night , and that a Gentleman stayed in the Street for him , and they two were going to do it . L. C. J . Where do you live ? And how long stayed he at your House ? Mr. Humston . I Lodged then at the Golden Key in Fleet-street over against Fetter-Lane End : He came to my Lodgings about Nine of the Clock at Night , and stayed there but a little time . L. C. J . What manner of Cloaths had he on . Mr. Humston . My Lord , he had a Cloak on , but I can not tell what Cloaths he had under it , he brought my Gown up under his Cloak . Mr. Darnell . Swear Esther King . Who was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Do you know what time Mr. Harrison was at Mr. Humston 's Lodgings . Esther King .

At the Golden Key in Fleet-street over against Fetter-Lane End . Mr. Darnell . What Cloaths had he on ? Esther King . I can not tell well , but he had a Cloak on , I do not know , what Cloaths he had on besides . Mr. Harrison . Was it Eight or Nine a Clock . Esther King . It was near Nine , as near as I can guess . Mr. Darnell . Swear John Sikes the Coachman . Which was done . Mr. Darnell . Give an Account to the Court , what you know about carrying two Men in your Coach , and how you found Dr. Clenche murdered . John Sikes , Coachman . My Lord , on the 4th . of January last , being Monday , I was at the Play-house , and there I took up a Man and a Woman , and carried them into theCity ; so I brought the Gentleman back again , to the Green Dragon Tavern in Fleet-street ; and then , he said , he would pay me by the hour ; he said , that it was but much about Nine a Clock . Then I left him , and was driving up the Street towards the Temple , and two Men stood in Fleet-street about Fetter-Lane End , and they asked me , if I knew Dr. Clenche , who Dwelt in Brownelowe-street in Holbourn : I told them , that I did not know Dr. Clenche , but I knew the Street . So they went into my Coach , and one of them bad me Drive thither , and I did , and stopt at the Streets End ; because the Gate at the other End was shut , so that I could not turn my Coach : And one of them , bad me go and tell the Dr. That there were two Gentlemen in a Coach at the Streets End , that would desire him , to go with them , to see one that was not Well . The Doctor asked me , if I could tell , Who they were ? Or , who it was , that he was to go to ? I told him , that I could not tell The Doctor was in his Night-Gown and Slippers , and he Dressed himself : And when he came to the Coach , one of them removed from his Place , and gave him the hinder-part of the Coach ; and told him , That they had a Friend , that was not Well : And one of them , bad me Drive to Leaden-Hall-Market ; and when I came about Holborn-Bars , one of them called to me , and asked me , Why I drove so slowly ? And bad me drive faster ; so I Drove fast , and came to Leaden-hall . And then one of them , bad me drive to the Pye Tavern without Aldgate , and there Ordered me to stop . And when I had stopped there , one of them called to me , and told me , that I need not stir out of my Coach-Box ; but call to the Boy at the Tavern , and ask for one Hunt a Chyrurgeon , which I did do : And when the Boy came to me again , he said , there was no such Man . Then one of them bad me Drive back again to Leaden-hall ; and in the time I stayed there , and turned my Coach , Aldgate was shut ; and when I came to the Gate , one of them gave Six Pence to the Watch , and the Gate was opened , and I drove to Leaden-hall Gate . And when I came there , I stopped again , and one of them gave me Half a Crown , and bad me go and buy a Fowl of one Hunt a Poulterer ; but after I had gone a little way from the Coach , he called me again , and said , Here Coachman , you had as good take an other Shilling , and buy a Couple : So I went , and bought a couple of Fowls , but I could find no such Poulterer as Hunt , so I bought them of another , and I gave three Shillings for them . And when I came back to the Coach side , I found Dr. Clenche , ( as I thought ) sitting against the Fore-seat , with his Head against the Cushion : I pull 'd him , and cried , Master , Master , for I thought he had been in Drink , but I could not get one word from him ; and then I went to the Watch , who were near ; and when they came , we found him Strangled with a Handcherchief about his Neck , and a Coal in it placed , just upon his Wind-Pipe , but the other two Men were gone . L. C. J . Had one of the two Men a Cloak on ? J. Sikes . I can not remember that . L. C. J . What kind of Habit had he ? Had he black Cloaths on ? J. Sikes . My Lord , I can not tell justly , what Cloaths he had . L. J. C. You have heard him speak . What said he ? J. Sikes . My Lord , he never spoke to me ; it was the other Man . Mr. Harrison . What kind of Man was the other ? Was he less than I , or taller ? J. Sikes . He was taller than you , with his own Hair . Mr. Darnell . Can you be positive , that the Prisoner at the Bar , is one of those two Persons . J. Sikes . My Lord , one of those two Persons , had a Perriwig on , of a Light coloured Hair : And I do verily believe , that the Prisoner at the Bar , is the same Person ; I can not be positive , he is one of them , but as near as I can judge of a Man , whom I have seen but once , he is one of them . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , I desire your Lordship to observe the time , that he took the two Men up , and what time it was that they ran out of the Coach . L. C. J. Coachman , what time was it , that they left your Coach ? J. Sikes . About half an hour past Ten , and it was about a quarter of an hour past Nine , when I took them up . Mr. Darnell . Pray let 's ask the Coachman one thing more . Coachman , Look upon that Handcherchief , do you know it , and where did you see it ? The Handkerchief was produced by the Coroner . J. Sikes . I do believe that it is the same Handkerchief , that was about Dr. Clenche 's Neck , when he was found Murdered . L. C. J . Call the Coachman again . Harke you , In what Posture did you find Dr. Clenche , when you came back to your Coach ? J. Sikes . My Lord , he was sat in the Bottom of the Coach , leaning on one side , with his head against the Cushion . L. C. J . Was a Handkerchief then about his Neck . J. Sikes . Yes , my Lord , I untied this Handkerchief , and this is the same ; and here is the Coal that was lapt in it ; It was lapt in the middle of it , and it laid just against the Doctor 's Wind-Pipe . Mr. Darnell . Call Mr. Rebone and Mr. Marriot . Who were Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Mr. Rebone , tell what you know , concerning the Handkerchief , and how you found the Doctor . He takes the Handkerchief , and looks o n't . Mr. Rebone . This Handkerchief , was about the Doctor 's Neck , and the Coal in it , and it lay just upon his Wind-pipe , when I saw him Dead in the Coach . The Coachman came to Mr. Marriot 's House , and ask 'd for a Constable , and we went to the Coach side , and there we found him laying along ; and we took him , and carried him to the Bull - Inn , and there he was let Blood on the Arms , and the Chyrurgeon took about half a Spoonful of Blood out of his Right Arm ; and he was let Blood on the other Arm , but that , did but just trickle down , and we could not get him to life again ; and we found a Silver Ink-horn in his Pocket , and that , and the rest of his things , were secured . That is all I can say to the Matter . Mr. Darnell : Call Mrs. Elianor Ashbolt . Who was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Mrs. Pray tell my Lord , and the Court , what you know of any Persons you saw in a Coach at Browne-lowe-street End , that Night Dr. Clenche was Murdered . Mrs. Ashbolt . May it please your Lordship , I went out of an Errand for one Madam Anwell , a Gentlewoman , who Lodges at my Mothers house ; and coming home again , I saw a Coach stop at Brownelowe-street End , between Nine and Ten a Clock at Night , and the Coachman went to the side of the Coach : And one in the Coach , bad him go to Dr. Clenche 's , and tell him , That there were two Gentlemen stayed for him in a Coach ; and as he went up the Street , he went slowly , and looked back two or three times : Whereupon , one of the Persons leaned out of the Coach , and did Swear at the Coachman to make hast , and I went round the Coach , and could discern Mr. Harrison 's face ; and I stayed , and saw Dr. Clenche go into the Coach , and one of them gave his Place to the Doctor . Mr. Darnell . Why were you so curious , Mistress , and what did you observe further ? Mrs. Ashbolt . Because I thought they might give the Coach-man a slip . I well observed Mr. Harrison , but do not know the other Man ; there were two Lamps burning ; one in Brownlowe-Street , and the other in Holborn , over-against the End of Brownlowe-Street ; and they lighted quite through the Coach , and the Men pulled themselves backwards , when they saw me look on them ; it was that Night that the Doctor was Murdered . I went to Newgate afterwards , Madam Clenche , desired me to go and see Mr. Harrison ; and when I came to Newgate , it seems , he was writing Letters , so I staid before I went into the Room ; and there were two Men with me , and Mr. Harrison was talking very loud , said they to me , Who is that speaks now ? Why , says I , it is one of the Persons that was in the Coach when Dr. Clenche was Murdered . L. C. J . Who are those two Men that were with you ? Mrs. Ashbolt . One of them , was one Mr. Jones , a Coach-maker in Holborn , and the other , was Madam Clenche 's Coach-man . L. C. J . Did you know the Prisoner , when you saw him in Newgate , to be one of them that were in the Coach ? Mrs. Ashbolt . Yes , I did , I knew him to be the same Man , as soon as I saw him , and he changed Countenance as soon as he saw me . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , this Woman is certainly hired by the Villains that are against me . Pray , ask her , my Lord , Why she did not make a Discovery sooner . L. C. J . Mistress , What say you to that ? Mrs. Ashbolt . I acquainted Madam Anwell , what I had seen and observed , and she told Madam Clenche , after last Sessions , and then she desired me to go to Newgate , to see Mr. Harrison , and I went accordingly ; and I would have told it to Madam Clenche sooner , but my Mother was loath I should be concerned about such a thing . Mr. Darnell . My Lord , we have some Witnesses who can give your Lordship an Account , that one of our Witnesses whom I mentioned to your Lordship before , is spirited , or withdrawn from us , by a Gentleman that said , he came to him from the Prisoner , and desired him to be kind to the Prisoner , which Witness is since absent , and not to be found ; his Name was Andrew Bowsell , a Youth , and an Apprentice to one Mr. Tims , a Shooe-maker . L. C. J . You must prove upon him , that he made him keep away . Mr. Darnell . Call Barnabas Smith . Who was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Give my Lord , and the Court an Account , what you know of this matter . Mr. Smith . My Lord , this Andrew Bowsell , which the Councel for the King , speaks of , was sent to Leaden-Hall-Street , of an Errand , to the Bull-head Ale-house there , and as he was going along , a Gentleman met him , and asked him , if he was not an Evidence against Mr. Harrison , and being told by the Boy that he was , he desired him to be kind to him , and pull 'd out a piece of Money , and offered it him , desiring him to be kind to Mr. Harrison , upon which , the Youth replied , That he owed him nothing , and nothing he would take ; then the Gentleman told him , That he would come again another time , and send for him near to his Master 's ; so the Boy said , and told me : And said further , That if he could have gotten him to have gone to the Bull-head Ale-house , he would have seized him . Mr. Darnell . What is become of the Boy ? Mr. Smith . Truly , we do not know , what is become of him , we never heard of him since the Sixth Day of March last . Mr. Darnell . Call his Master , Mr. Richard Tims . Who was Sworn . Mr. Darnell . Tell my Lord , and the Court , what you know of this matter , and what is become of your Apprentice , Andrew Bowsell . Mr. Tims . My Lord , he went away from me on the Sixth Day of March last , he was enticed away by three Souldiers , that Night , and on the Morrow Morning , one of them came and demanded his Coats , Shirts and Neckcloths ; says I to him , Who sent you , and who is your Captain ? and he answered , why , Captain Harris ; so he husl 'd and said , That if I would not give him the Cloathes , he would send his Officer ; and then I told the Souldier , I would have him before a Justice of Peace ; so he went away , and never came to me again ; and I could never hear of my Apprentice since , tho ' I have made great Inquiry after him . L. C. J . Did your Servant tell you of any Money that had been offered him by the before-mentioned Gentleman ? Mr. Tims . No , my Lord ; he did not tell me , but he told Mr. Smith , the Witness that was last Examined , as he told me . Mr. Darnell . My Lord , I desire that Andrew Bowsell 's Examination taken before Mr. John Brown , the Coroner of London , upon Oath , may be read . Which being proved by the Coroner , were directed to be read . Clerk of the Peaco Roads . 12o . Januarii , 1691 . Andrew Bowsell , Servant to Richard Tims Shoomaker , Sworn and Examined touching the Death of Andrew Clench Doctor in Physick , deceased : faith , that he , this Informant , being sent to Mr. Parker 's at the Bull-Head Ale-house in Leaden-Hall-Street , on Monday last was Seven night , being the fourth of this instant January , between the hours of Ten and Eleven of the Clock in the Evening , saw a Coach standing against Leaden-Hall-Market , and heard some Person that was in the Coach say , make haste . And this Informant says , that according to the best of his remembrance that he heard him talk of a Poulterers ; and this Informant says , that soon after the Coachman was gone into the Market , this Informant saw two Persons go out of the Coach , one whereof had , as this Informant believes , a black Coat on ; and that this Informant saw the same Person as soon as he came out of the Coach fling a Cloak over him , and then both the Persons went through the Market on the west part : And this Informant faith , that this Informant going to look into the Coach , the Person that had the Cloak on him , cry 'd Dam him ; and this Informant faith , that he , this Informant , thereupon going away , went to Mr. Parker 's , and told them that two Persons had cheated a Coachman , or to that effect . Andrew Bowsell being further Examined the 23th day of January , 1691. touching the Death of Andrew Clench , faith , that he hath seen Henry Harrison , now Prisoner in Their Majesties Goal of Newgate , and believes he was one of the Persons that came out of the Coach at Leaden-hall , a little after ten of the Clock at Night , on Monday the 4th of this Instant January ; and believes he knows him by his Voice . And soon after , this Informant understood that the said Andrew Clench was murther 'd in a Coach , being the same Coach which the said Harrison , and another Person unknown a little before went out of . L. C. J. Mr. Harrison , what have you to say against that which hath been proved against you , what defence can you make ? Mr. Harrison , My Lord , I did attend Dr. Clench about a Mortgage that was made him by Mrs. Vanwick , and Dr. Clench did pay one Hundred Pounds , but this Gentlewoman would pay or allow Rowe but Fifteen Pounds , and we did not know how to get the Money from Rowe , so we Petition 'd the Lords Commissioners about it , which was above Six Months before Doctor Clench was Murther 'd ; and Mr. Fairbeard wonder 'd that I would put Doctor Clenche 's Name into a Petition with such a Rogue as Rowe ; and I do positively say , that I had not seen Dr. Clench in a Month before , and if Doctor Clench had died in his Bed it had been the same thing to me ; and , my Lord , Mr. Johnson and I had never any angry words between us ; and I have the Report in Chancery which I had from Sir John Hoskins , which I will read , if your Lordship pleases . L. C. J . Let 's see it . Which was handed to the Lord Chief Justice Sitting upon the Bench . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , that is the Original , which if your Lordship pleases to remember , I had Rowe before you twice about it , and it is Rowe that hath been the Rogue , and therefore what occasion had we to be angry with Doctor Clench ? Then the Report was perus 'd by the Lord Chief Justice , and return 'd to him . L. C. J. Mr. Harrison , this will do you no good , not being to the present purpose , therefore proceed in your defence . Mr. Harrison . Now , my Lord , I have some Witnesses to prove where I was at the time that the Coachman says the Murther was done . Cryer , call Thomas Turner a Porter , and Mr. Maccaffee . Who appeared , but were not Sworn , and were Examined apart , at the Request of Mr. Darnell , the Kings and Queens Councell . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , I shall prove by these Witnesses , that I was elsewhere when the Coach-man said he took up those two Men , a little afterNine-a-Clock . Pray Mr. Turner , give an Account to the Court , what time it was I called you to carry my Trunk . Tho . Turner . My Lord , I was , about Seven of the Clock in the Evening , the 4th Day of January last , at the Two Kings and Key in Fleet-street , over against Salisbury-Court ; and I was told , that a Gentleman at Joe 's Coffee-house in Salisbury-Court wanted a Porter ; and I presently went to him thither , and it was this Mr. Harrison : and he bad me take up his Trunk , which I , did , and carried it to the Two Kings and Key , and he went with me : And he asked me to get some Linnen wash 'd for him against the next Day at Noon ; and he gave me some Linnen , which I carried to my Wife to wash for him , and return 'd to him again presently ; and I went with him from thence , and carry 'd his Trunk to his Lodgings in Paul 's Church-yard ; and when I had deliver 'd his Trunk , I left him there ; and then it was about Eight of the Clock at Night . L. C. J . At whose House was it , you deliver 'd the Trunk ? Tho . Turner . My Lord , it was at Mr. Jones 's House , in Paul 's Churchyard . L. C. J . And did he stay within ? Tho . Turner . No , my Lord , he went out presently after me . L. C. J . Were you any where else with him that Night , besides at the places you have mentioned ? Tho . Turner . No , my Lord . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , I will prove that Mr. Humston mistakes an Hour . Mr. Humston . I can not mistake an Hour , because the Shop is shut up about Nine-a-Clock , and it was shut when you came first to my Lodgings . Mr. Harrison . My Lord , there stands in Court one Thomas Johnson , Apprentice to Mr. Pemmel ; he can tell what time a-night it was I came to Mr. Humston 's , he let me in ; I desire he may be call 'd . Mr. Darnell . Swear Thomas Johnson . [ Who was sworn . ] L. C. J . What time of the Night was it that Mr. Harrison came to speak with Mr. Humston , on that Night Dr. Clenche was murder 'd ? Tho .

And I told him , he was : And he came in , and went up to Mr. Humston 's Chamber ; and it was then about Nine of the Clock , as near as I can guess . L. C. J . Where is your Master 's House ? Tho . Johnson . My Lord , it is the Golden Key in Fleet-street , over against Fetter-lane end . Mr. Harrison . Pray call Adam Maccaffee , Mr. White , Mr. Carden , and John Allen .
