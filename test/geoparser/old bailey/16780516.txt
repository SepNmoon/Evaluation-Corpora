The first that came to his tryal , was a little boy , pretending not to be above ten years of age , for stealing a silver Salt of the value of ten pounds , out of a Goldsmith s shop . There were two other greater Thieves concerned with him , who having several Indictments against them , pleaded guilty to this and all other within the benefit of Clergy : They gave aim and directions , and this little Mercury did the Feat ; for which he was found guilty , but in pity to his age , he was onely burnt in the Hand . A man and a woman were indicted for stealing a bay Mare , taken out of a stable in Essex on the 4th of March last , and brought by the woman at the Bar into an Inne in Aldersgate-street . Against the man there was no Evidence , and the woman alleadged that she was onely a Messenger hired by a person executed last Sessions , to remove the Mare from one Inne to another ; and thereupon were both acquitted . A man , his Wife , and another woman were indicted for stealing four Demicasters the 17th of April last , about London bridge . The man confessed it , the woman who sold them in Longlane one justified her self as being his wife , the other as coming by them by his delivery ; and so got off . A wench coming to Service by Newgate street , after she had been there a fortnight , takes her opportunity in her Master s and Mistrisses absence to steal a silver Tankard valued at 3 l. 10 s. and a very considerable quantity of Linnen and wearing Apparel ; with which she flies to Oxford , and there upon the notice given in the Gazette , was taken with part of the Goods , and now found guilty of Felony , alleadging she was instigated to it by a Sweet-heart of hers that came from Portsmouth . A man and a woman indicted for stealing 3 l 6 d. in money and a great quantity of Linnen and Clothes out of an Alehouse in Beech lane ; where four of them came to drink one pair of stairs , and so 't is thought picklockt the door two pair of stairs , no body else being that way between the time the things were seen and miss 'd ; yet there being no positive proof , nor any thing taken upon them , they were found not guilty . Another fellow for stealing a silver Beaker out of a publick house in the same Parish , had not such good luck ; for his Companion exposing it to sale , and offering him as a voucher , the first fled , and he was taken , and partly by his own words was found guilty . A Country man was arraigned for taking away23 pieces of broad Gold on the 22th of Nov. last out of a Victualing house in St. Dunstans in the West . He and another came thither to dine in a Room where was a Closet ; which the woman occasionally opening , left the key in the door , and the Prisoner being old Acquaintance in the house , pulled open the door and lookt into the Closet ; which the other in a jesting way told the woman of , and bid her look if she miss 'd any thing : who seeing all things in order , and particularly her Purse , where she left it , concluded her Gold safe , and said she miss 'd nothing at present , but if she did afterwards , he should answer it . Three weeks after , she misses her Gold , and speaks to the said other Gentleman to tell the now Prisoner of it , being in the Country , who resolutely denies it . But that which seem 'd to have most weight , was , that amongst this Gentlewomans Gold there was one piece that was of Olivers Coyn , and remarkable for several tokens as she declared , and it appeared the Prisoner had lately sold just such a piece to a person of Honour ; which being produced , had exactly such marks as she had before declared , and now upon her Oath affirmed it to be the same to her best belief and knowledge . However , the Case appearing dubious , and the Prisoner ( who was proved by a multitude of persons of worth to be both a very honest and very able and substantial man ) alleadging , and the before-mentioned Honourable person declaring to the best of his remembrance , that he sold him thatpiece at Michaelmas last , whereas she lost not hers till 22 Nov. and for that one piece might be like another , and she not missing them till so long after , some other body might in the mean time take them : The Jury therefore thought fit to acquit the person charged , from the Crime pretended against him . The next was the eminent Tryal of Charles Pamplin for Murdering Lieutenant Charles Dalison , in which a great number of Witnesses were examined . First it was proved , that on Sunday the 28th of April last , about ten a clock at night Mr. Dalison neer his Lodging over against the Rose-Tavern in Covent garden , was mortally wounded being run in under the left Pap six inches deep : Who it was did it none saw , but two swore Mr. Dalison said it was Pamplin , and died within a quarter of an hour . A stick was taken up on the place , which 't was proved the Prisoner had borrowed that morning . 'T was proved the day before he coming into a mans Chamber while he was asleep , took away a very long Sword and left his own in the room of it , which long Sword compared now with Mr. Dalisons , exceeded it a quarter of a yard in length , 'T was also proved , the Prisoner had declared , Mr. Dalison had affronted him , and that he would be reveng 'd ; and that very morning he told one , he resolv 'd to cudgel one that had abused him , and about ten or eleven a clock at night ( just about the time Dalison was killed ) he past by the same person in hast , and looking amazedly , said onely , He had met with him . That he was thereabouts till it was late walking up and down , did appear ; nay , one woman swore that he confest he kill 'd the Lieutenant , and at his taking in Jewen street he endeavour 'd to flie , and said , He was a dead man . Upon all which , and divers other most violent Circumstances , being able to alleadge very little for himself , but rather what made against him , as that he was sure Mr. Dalison was kill 'd after ten a clock , & c. he was found guilty of the Murder , and received Sentence of Death . Then three lusty young fellows were tryed for two several Robberies on the Highway , but of that baser kind called the Foot pad . One was on a person passing on foot through King Harries Walk , whom they set upon , beat , took from him about five shillings , all that he had about him , and then flung him into a Ditch and bound him . The other was on a Butcher on horse-back , who riding home with his Wife behinde him , in the evening spied these three men lurking under a Tree , and endeavoured to turn his horse , but before he could get back , was beset ; whereupon he alighted and run for it , and they after : In the mean time the Wife rides away to get help ; but they overtaking him , take from him three pounds , binde him , and get away , but were all taken , one at London , and two at Newington , the next morning : and now both the persons swore directly and positively against them all three ; whereupon they were Condemned . 'T is observable these Robberies were done the last Execution-day at night , and it was proved these Prisoners were that day at Tyburn in a Coach ; so little did the sad fight of their Fellow-Criminals wretched end affect them , that in defiance to Justice they went immediately from that Spectacle to act the same or like Crimes as had brought the others thereunto . A young Lad that was in but the last Sessions , was now arraigned for stealing 140 l. on the 27th of April last out of a Goldsmith s shop in Lumbard street . He watcht his opportunity when there was no body in the shop but a Maid-servant , and stepping behinde the Counter , snatches up two bags of money : The Maid seeing him go out with them , concluded him some Merchants man that came for some Money he had left there ; but when they came to count over their Cash , they one bag of 80 l. and another of 60 l. missing . Upon further inquiry there was a Porter saw him go forth also with the bags : so that being able to give a description , one of the Marshals men took him the next day ; but the Money was not to be found . The Gentleman that lost it , to draw him to a discovery , put 20 l. more into his hands , which he was to haveif he would help him to it again . The boy pretended 't was buried in a Field , & c. but spent between 20 and 30 s. of the 20 l. and now denied he knew any thing of the said Robbery , much less what was become of the 140 l. However , on the aforesaid Evidence , knowing him again , he was Convicted and burn in the hand . The little boy first mentioned , was next day tryed again , and found guilty of stealing from a Goldsmith in Holborn eight silver Spoons valued at 4 l. six silver Forks , silver Tumblers ; of which , part being taken upon him , were produced in Court . Two notorious Horse stealers were Convicted on several Indictments , being both joyutly found guilty of stealing two Horses from Bednal green ; one of which was taken at Westminster , the other sold into Sussex . They were likewise found guilty together of stealing a dun Guelding on the 10th of Apr . and one of them likewise by himself , Convicted on two several Indictments on the like kind : For which they received Sentence of Death . A woman was Convicted of stealing a silver Trencher-plate of his Excellencies the Portugal Embassadors , whose Arms she had scratcht out ; but bringing it to sell , the honest Goldsmith stopt it on suspition , and afterwards by putting it in the fire , or some such Art he used , as did not withstanding make most part of the Arms conspicuous , he thereby discovered the Owner , and seized the Thief ; who was now Convicted , but reprieved before Judgment . Two person s were here in question about false and counterfeit Guinnies . One of them not long since was Convicted at Salisbury , as he now confest in Court , for the Cheat of putting off such false Guinnies ; and now it was proved he had put off no less than three , one at a Tavern in Moore-fields , which was produced in Court ; another at Hackney , where he was apprehended , and offered 10 l. to evade Prosecution , but the party was a better friend to Justice than to accept it ; a third at another place . There was an Indictment against them for High Treason ; but there was not sufficient Evidence to prove that they counterfeited them : But on the other Indictment for misdemeanour in cheating and defrauding the Kings Subjects , 't was apparent they were guilty . There were in all Ten persons that received Sentence of Death , viz . Seven men , one for Murder , three notorious High-way men for several Robberies , two upon five several Indictments for Horse-stealing , a young man for a Felony , having been before burnt in the hand since Christmas last ; and Three women , one for robbing her Master of goods to a great value , the other two ( whereof one was an old notorious offender ) for several Felonies committed under presence of taking Lodgings , thereby having ruined divers honest poor people . Besides these , there were Fourteen burnt in the hand , hour ordered to be whipt , Seven women sent from Newgate to Bridewel , and Twenty nine persons attainted or convicted heretofore of divers Crimes , that now all at once on their knees in Court pleaded his Majesties-gracious Pardon .
