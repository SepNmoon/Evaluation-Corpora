Whereupon he wrote a Letter to the Prisoner , and sent it to him to Newington , about it . Upon which he came to him , and was very full of Reflections upon Mr. Biddle 's , and took some notice of Mr. Biddle 's charging him with the Expressious mentioned in the Indictment , and owned that he did say , That if Pretender , as he was called , was King James 's Son , and was not a Bastard , then King George was an Usurper : To which he replied , That if he persisted in such Talk it might perchance lead him into ill Conveniencies . The Prisoner answered , He did say so , and should say so as long he breathed : To which he replied , That if he did , perhaps he might not breath long . But however his Business with him was not in relation to any thing of that Nature , but that he would pay Biddle his Money . That they then parted . And some Time after he went to Biddle , and demanded the Note , which was 36 s. and taking the Note , laid him down 30 s. and tore the Note . Upon this Mr. Biddle came to him again , and complained of the tearing the Note . That thereupon they went to Justice Hill , and got a Warrant to take him up for rearing the Note , and went to him to go to Mr. Biddle and make it up . But he not going , but keeping out of the way ; but meeting accidentally with him at the Castle-Inn in Wood-street , got him apprehended . In some Discourse he remembered him of the Words he had said . To which he replied , That if the Pretender , so called , was not a Bastard , both Queen Ann and King George were Usurpers . This was confirmed by the Constable . And he being apprehended and carried before Sir John Fryer , only on Account of tearing the Note . The Matter being composed as to that , he enquired of the Persons if they would Prosecute him upon those Expressions but they declining it , he was discharged . But Sir John considering afterwards that such Expressions were of ill Consequence to be tolerated , sends for him again , and binds the Evidence to prosecute . The Prisoner , in his Defence , recriminated upon Biddle , saying that he was enquiring of him what News : He answered , All you Jacobite Rogues are spoiled now , and the Bastard the Pretender was fled beyond the Alps . That thereupon he replied , it was well if the Pretender was a Bastard , or else King George was an Usurper . He likewise objected against the manner of his Commitment , in that Sir John Fryer , when he had been carried before him on the Account of the Note , and the Matter being agreed , and he discharged , and the other Persons , as Mr. Biddle and Mr. Tull , had declined prosecuting him on the Account of these Expressions , that Sir John should send for him again , and oblige them to prosecute him As to that he was answered by the Court , ( in Sir John Fryer 's hearing , he being on the Bench ) that their Opinion did differ from his in that Matter : for as he thought he had done very well , and but what was his Duty to do , for as much as the tolerating Persons to talk after that seditious manner would be of very pernicious Consequence : And that King George 's Title to the Crown did not depend upon the Pretender 's being a Bastard , for that he had a very good and legal Title to that , whether the Pretender was the Son of King James , or not . He called three Persons one of which had known him six Weeks , another six Months , and another a Year , which indeed did not say much to the purpose . One said he had heard him pray for the King ( as he thought ) another had known him drink the King 's Health : But this had little avail , the Jury thought the Fact plain enough to find him guilty of the Indictment .

Powers , who flung his Sword on the Table , and the Prisoner put his down ; that they paid the Reckoning , and Wright went down , he following him ; that hearing the Prosecutor cry out , he went back and found the Prisoner had almost throttled him , having got him under his Arm , and saw him pull his Hand out of his pocket .

Powers , and demanded his Money be ow 'd him , who , swearing and cursing in a most violent manner , calling him Rogue , Villain and Rascal , drew his Sword , saying , if he would have it , he should fight for it ; that he likewise run his Fist in his Face ; that then he seiz 'd him , and had him down : The Prosecutor told him , that if he would let him rise , he would give him his 3 Guineas ; which he did with his own Hand out of his Pocket , and then immediately said , that he would swear he had pick 'd his Pocket . The Prisoner alledg 'd , that the Prosecution was malicious , because the Prosecutor was apprehensive of being taken up by a Warrant which the Prisoner had obtain 'd for that End ; that the Prosecutor had said , that he would not have done it , but to save his Place , Bread and Reputation , and for that the Prisoner would have an Information against him . The Prisoner brought abundance to his Reputation ; The Jury consider 'd the whole , and acquitted him . The Trials being over , the Court proceeded to give Judgment , as follows .
