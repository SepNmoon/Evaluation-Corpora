Thomas Edwards . Between 5 and 6 at Night , as I was going thro ' Colston's-Court in Drury-Lane , Gammer took me by the Hand , and asked me to give her a Dram ; I said , I would not , for I was in haste , and going about my Master 's Business ; and with that , she snatch 'd off my Hat , and run in a Doors ; I followed her , and she locked the Door upon me , and called for Liquor , and told me , I should pay for it ; I told her , I would neither pay nor drink . Then she pulled out a Knife , and swore I should . So I was in amaze , and gave 6 d. for the Brandy to another Woman that belong 'd to the House , and Gammer took it from her , and said , it was not Good . Then they called their Landlady Rodes ( the other Prisoner ) and I said , if they would give me back that 6d . and another , I would give them a Shilling , but Rodes would have the Shilling first , and when I had given it her , she would give me no Change . Then I begged them to let me out , but they beat me and made my Mouth bleed , and made game of me , and they pick 'd my Pocket of a Counter , but when they saw what it was , they gave it me again , and said , Damn him , he 'll swear a Robbery against us . Then the two Prisoners made me go up Stairs , and Gammer knocked me down on the Bed , and called Rodes and they both together turned my Pockets inside out , and took a Handkerchief , a Key , and a Snuff-Box from me ; but when they saw the Snuff-Box was not Silver , they gave it me again .

When they were at the Constable 's House they both said , they had never seen the Black . Elizabeth Gammer . As I was going home , about 9 at Night , the black Boy met me , and offered to make me drink , for he said he had not drank with a white Woman a good while . He called for 2 Quarterns , and wanted to go into a private Room to have carnal Knowledge with me . He said he had but a Shilling to pay for the Brandy , but if I would oblige him , he would call again , and satisfy me . John White . When Gammer was before Justice Mitford , she swore the Black was dmn 'd , for she had never seen him in her Life . Margaret Williams . I have laid Mrs. Rodes of five Children , but I do n't know what sort of a House she keeps , for I never looked into it ; for my Business is to be here and there , and every where , you know . Sarah Cart . Mary Rodes is my own Sister , I hope she has a good Character . Her Husband left her big with her last Child . Court . Is her Husband living ? Sarah Cart . I never heard to the contrary . Mary Rodes . My Husband 's Name is William Davis . Court .

The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . Constantine Conway , and Samuel Quan , of St. Dunstan 's in the West , were indicted for Assaulting Job Nutton , in an open Place , called Bolt-Court , near the High-way , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 3 Guineas , and 20 Shillings , Jan. 12 . [ At the Desire of the Prisoners , the Witnesses against them were examined apart . ] Job Nutton . About 7 a Clock , last Wednesday Night , I was going along Fleet-street , to my Master ( who was at the Bull-head Tavern at Temple-bar ) and , on this Side Shoe Lane , there were two Girls , who were singing Ballads ; and a Gentleman threatned to beat the Girls , because some-body had pick 'd his Pocket . I stood a little to see what was the Matter , when Quan ( the tallest of the Prisoners ) stoop 'd down before me , and took up Half a Crown . Sir , says he to me , I believe 't is a good one ; let 's go to the Light at that Shop-window , and see , and , if it is , I 'll give you Half a Pint . We went ; he rubb 'd some of the wet Dirt off : It was a very remarkable Piece ; it was bent , and look 'd as if a Coach-wheel had ran over it . Sir , says he , pray lend me another Half-Crown to compare with it . I did so . He rubb 'd 'em one upon the other , and said , I find 't is good , and for Luck 's sake , I 'll treat you . I have a Friend lives at the upper-end of this Court ( we were then at the lower-end of Bolt-Court ) where we can have a Glass of good Wine . - Come , Sir , I 'll shew you the Way . I was got but a little up the Court , when Conway ( the short , lame Prisoner ) clapp 'd a Pistol to my Breast , and said , Damn you , Sir , deposit . Quan presented another Pistol , at the same Time ; and Conway put his Right-hand into my Left Pocket , and took out 3 Guineas , and 20s . A Woman came up the Court . Quan swore , if I made the least Noise , he would shoot me thro ' the Head . When she was pass 'd , Conway said , Damn you Sir , you have got a Watch , we must have that ; and began to search for it . The String of my Watch was thrust into my Fob , so that they could not get at it readily ; and more Company coming up the Court , Conway walk 'd off , and Quan took me by the Shoulder , led me into the Street , bade me go forward quietly , and swore , if I offer 'd to speak , or turn back , he would be my Death . I went to my Master at Temple-bar , and from thence to the Queen's-head in Red-Lion-Court , in Long-Acre , where I related what had happen 'd , and described the Prisoners so perfectly , that some in the Company said , they knew 'em by the Description , and would send for Mr. Haton , the Constable , who knew their Haunts , and would take 'em . Mr. Haton came ; I gave him the same Description , and he apprehended 'em at a Baudy-house the same Night , and they were carried before a Justice . I swore to Quan , and to the bent Half-crown , which was taken upon him . I was a little scrupulous of swearing too positively against Conway , that Night , on account of his Crutch , For , when Conway robb 'd me , he stooped to take the Money out of my Pocket , and I took Notice that his Crutch reached above the Bend of his Arm , and when he was brought before the Justice , I thought that his Crutch , ( which was a short Hand-crutch ) appear 'd to be shorter than it was over Night ; but , next Morning , I consider 'd , that the Difference consisted only in the Position of his Body ; for , when he stooped , his Crutch might reach above the Bend of his Arm , tho ' , when he stood upright , it would reach no higher than his Hand . My Scruple about his Crutch being thus removed ( for I had no doubt as to his Person ) I was fully satisfied , and swore to him as positively as to the other , and I am now certain , that the Prisoners are the two Men that robbed me in Bolt-Court last Wednesday Night . I saw Quan plainly at the Shop-window when we look 'd at the Half-crown ; and I saw them both , when they took my Money , by a Light that came from Bolt-Court Coffee-house . They had light natural Wigs on then , tho ' now they have got dark Wigs to disguise themselves . Conway . Was not you drinking , and playing at Cards with me , at the Mourning-Bush Tavern , at Aldersgate , the Day before you say we robbed you ? Nutton . No : I never was in your Company before you robbed me . Quan . When you was before the Justice , you , at first , said , that you could not swear positively to either of us . Nutton . When I first came into the Room , at the Justice 's , there was but one Candle , and you stood on one Side of me , so that I had not then a full View of your Face . Three more Candles were brought in ; the Half-crown was shewn me , which I knew at first Sight , and swore to be the same that we look 'd on at the Shop-window . Then I turned about , and saw you ; and , as soon as I had looked you full in the Face , I was certain , and swore positively that you was the Man . Quan . What Hour was it when ( as you say ) you was robbed ? Nutton . About 7 , or between 7 and 8 at Night . Joseph Haton , Constable . About 9 a Clock , on Wednesday last , a Gentleman came to me , and told me , that a young Man , who was at the Queen's-Head in Red-Lion-Court , had been robb 'd . I went thither , and found the Prosecutor , who gave me so exact a Description of the Persons who had robb 'd him , that I presently believ 'd the Prisoners to be the Men . He said , That near Bolt-Court in Fleet-street , the tallest of the two Rogues stooped down before him , and took up a Half-crown ; That they went to a Shop-window , to see if it was good : It was dirty , bent in the Middle , and bruised in the Head ; That this Rogue offer 'd to treat him with Half a Pint for Luck 's sake , and carried him up Bolt-Court , where a short , thick , lame Rogue clapp 'd a Pistol to his Breast , and bade him deposit : The tall Rogue presented another Pistol ; the lame Rogue rifled him ; a Woman came up the Court ; the tall Rogue threatned to shoot him , if he spoke ; the lame Rogue felt for his Watch , but the String being in his Fob , and other People coming by , he went off ; and then the tall Rogue , taking him ( the Prosecutor ) by the Shoulder , led him down the Court , and bade him go off quietly , or he was a dead Man . - I knew the Prisoners Haunts , and taking two Men to assist me , I went in search of 'em to James Thomson 's ( a notorious Baudy-house ) in Holsford 's Alley in Drury-lane . This was abouthalf an Hour after Ten . I found no Body at Home but a Woman . I took a Turn in the Neighbourhood , and , posting my two Assistants in a proper Place ( to avoid Suspicion ) I came to the same House again . It was then about 10 or 15 Minutes past 11 , and found 'em both sitting by the Fire . T hey asked me how I did , and if I had any thing to say to them ? I pretended that I had got a Warrant to search for a Woman . They said , they believed them were more Whores and Thieves in Fleet-street , than in Drury-lane . I went out again to see for my Assistants , and ordered one of them to go into the Court , at one End , and one at the other , and so meet at Thomson 's Door . At my return , Quan was standing at the End of the Alley : I seized him , and searching his Pockets , found some Gold and Silver , and this very batter 'd , bent Half-crown . One of his Madams , who was standing by him , lent me this Paper to wrap it in . Then we went into the House , and took Conway . They have followed the Trade of dropping Half-crowns a pretty while . We carried them before Justice Mitford , and sent for the Prosecutor . When the Prosecutor came in , there was but one Candle , but three more were brought , and Quan was standing on one Side of the Prosecutor . I shew 'd the batter 'd Half-crown to the Prosecutor , and as soon as he saw it , he said , I 'll swear to this . The Justice bade him see if he knew any Body there . He turned about , and taking a full View of Quan 's Face , he swore positively , that Quan was one of 'em . You Rascal , says Quan , do you say that I held a Pistol to you ? I never saw you in my Life . The Prosecutor , turning to Conway , said , And I believe this to be the other ; but when he stooped to take the Money out of my Pocket , I thought his Crutch was longer then , than it appears to be now . To which Conway answer 'd much as Quan had done ; You Rascal , did I hold a Pistol to you ? I never saw your Face before . And yet , next Day , one of 'em said to the Prosecutor , How could you be such a Rascal , to swear we robb 'd you , when we won the Money of you at Cards , at the Mourning-Bush at Aldgate - Aldgate ! said the other , No ; it was Aldersgate , and the Drawer will swear it . I asked the Drawer about it , and he said , he did not know the Prosecutor . Joseph Dudley . I went with the Constable to take the Prisoners . When they were examined before the Justice , they both said to the Prosecutor , Ye Rascal , did we hold Pistols to you ? We never saw you in our Lives . But next day they both said they had won it of him at Cards , at the Mourning-Bush , the Day before the Robbery was committed . The Defence of the Prisoners . Quan . Last Tuesday Night , as I was going along Fleetstreet , I found Half-a-Crown , and taking it up , the Prosecutor cry 'd Halves ! I told him that as he was by when I took it up , I would give him half a Pint , with all my Heart ; and in going along we met Conway , and so we all three went to the Mourning-Bush at Aldersgate , where we play 'd at Cards , and staid till between 1 and 2 in the Morning . Nutton . It was not Tuesday Night , but Wednesday Night , that he shew 'd me the Half Crown that he pick 'd up . Quan . It was Wednesday Morning when we parted ; and in the Afternoon Conway and I went to a House in Water-Lane , and there we staid till Eleven at Night . Elizabeth Collins . I was Nurse to a Gentlewoman ( Mrs. Hill ) who lies-in in Britain 's Court in Water-Lane ; and last Wednesday between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , the Prisoners both came in and asked how my Mistress did ? They were both to be Godfathers , but I suppose they came by Accident now , for I know of no Invitation . I never saw them before that Night . They went up one Pair of Stairs into the Room where she lay-in . She was a-bed and asleep . I desired them not to disturb her , and told them that Ann Davis ( who lodged at Mrs. Gray 's next Door ) was married that Day , and the Company were gone to the George Alehouse . I suppose they were acquainted with her . So they went away directly , telling me that they 'd go and sit at the Ale-house a little till my Mistress waked . About an Hour afterwards I was going to Market to get a Leg of Mutton for the Wedding-Supper , and call 'd in at the George to know what Victuals they would have for the Wedding-Supper . I saw the Prisoners both there . I went in again as I came back , which was in about half an Hour ( for I went to Market as far as the Butcher-Row by Temple-Bar ) and they were both there then too . Between 8 and 9 I went again to tell them that Supper was ready . I asked what a Clock it was , to know if the Meat was done ; and they told me it wanted a Quarter of 9 . The 2 Prisoners , and the new-married Couple , and 2 or 3 more came over and supp 'd at my Mistress 's . They staid till within a Quarter of 11 . I was there , and they were in the Room all the time . As I lighted them down , the Watch said , Take Care of your Lights ! and I asked him what was a Clock ? and he said , a quarter before 11 . Court . How far is this from Bolt-Court ? Collins . Bolt-Court is over-against Water Lane . Court , to the Constable . At what time did you take the Prisoners in Drury-Lane ? Constable . At near a quarter past 11. Prudence Grey . I was at Ann Davis 's Wedding ; but she went by the Name of Goare , She was married last Wednesday ; we came from the Fleet in a Coach to Mr . Waters 's ( the George Alehouse in Water-Lane ) between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , and as soon as we got out of the Coach the 2 Prisoners came in and staid then with us till between 9 and 10 , and then they went to Supper at Mrs. Hill 's , and I followed presently after ; and as soon as we had supp 'd I went back to the Ale-house , where I staid half an Hour , and then return 'd to Mrs. Hill 's , and found the Prisoners still there . We staid and saw the Bride and Bridegroom a-bed , and then we all came away , which was a quarter before 11. William Mead . The Couple were married at the Hand and Pen in Fleet Lane , about One a clock in the Afternoon , last Wednesday I gave the Bride away . We came back to the George ; the two Prisoners came in about 4 , and said they came from Mrs. Hill 's . We staid till between 8 and 9 , and then went all together , 6 or 7 of us , to Mrs. Hill 's to Supper . There were 9 or 10 of us in all . I staid till about 10 , and then left 'em . The Prisoners were not once out of my Company from 4 to 10. Ann Davis was marry 'd to one Wilson , a Cheesemonger , in White-Chapel . I am a Fruiterer . Henry Sprat . I was invited to the Wedding . We came back to the George about 4 , and the 2 Prisoners came in there about half a quarter of an Hour after us . We sat in a publick Room , and staid till about 9. when we were call 'd to Supper to Mrs. Hill 's , and there we staid till a Quarter before 11 , and then the Prisoners ask 'd which way I was going ? I told them towards Charing-Cross ; they went with me to Temple-Bar , where we went in to drink at a Fine-Alehouse , which is part of an old Tavern , call 'd the Apolo Tavern , and we parted at half an Hour past 11 . I knew nothing of the Prisoners before : Wilson ( the Bridegroom ) was a Taylor ; but now he keeps a Cheesemonger's-Shop , in Petticoat-Lane . Ann Wilson , alias Goare , alias Davis . I was marry 'd last Wednesday at the Fleet , I do n't know at what Sign it was , but we came to the George between 3 and 4 . The two Prisoners came in soon after . I never saw them before , they staid till between 8 and 9 , and then went to Supper at Mrs. Hill 's , my Spouse invited them to Supper , he 's now out of Town , or he would have been here . They were there all the Time till we went to Bed , which was half an Hour past 10. John Edwards , Drawer at the Mourning-Bush . Last Tuesday between 1 and 2 in the Afternoon , Conway came to our House to change a Guinea , and ask 'd , if 2 young Men were not come in ? I told him , No ; he said , they 'd come presently then ; he went out at the back Door and met them , and they all 3 came in and went up Stairs together ; they call 'd for half a Pint of Wine , and Pen , Ink , and Paper ; they came down , and Conway paid the Reckoning , and went out at the back Door , and the 2 others went out at the fore Door . I do n't know the 3d Person , for I did not see his Face , but he was in a sort of a white Coat . Court . Look at the Prosecutor , is that the Man ? Edwards . I ca n't say that it is , I did not see his Face , he had a sort of a white Coat , but this young Man has a Greenish Livery . Benjamin Hamileton .

Elizabeth Caton was indicted for privately stealing a Gold Watch , Value 12 l. from the Person of , Gent . on the 11th of December last . C - B - . I happen 'd to be coming from London very much in Liquor , and I went into the View of Oxford , about 6 or 7 at Night , on the 17th of December - 't is a Sign - the View of Oxford is a Sign in Chelsea-Road , Mr. Figg keeps the House . I had been drinking frequently , and I may say heartily , in the City of London , so that I was got a little too much by the Head ; and coming into the View of Oxford , the Prisoner was setting by me , and ask 'd me to give her half a Pint of Wine . Prisoner . You say that you pick 'd me up at the View of Oxford . C - B - . No ; I met her in the Park , and took her with me to the View of Oxford , and there I gave her half a Pint of Wine ; and when she went out I felt for my Watch to see if it was Time for me to go home , but I could not find it . Mr. Figg went after her and fetch 'd her in again , and I took the Watch out of her Stomach . Henry Whitby . I am Drawer at the View of Oxford , Mr. C - B - and this Woman came in together about 7 , I shewed them into a private ground Room ; they called for half a Pint of Wine and two Cakes ; after they had staid some time , I heard the Woman sumbling at the back Door , and before I came to her she was got out ; I presently run to the Room where I had left them , to see if he was not gone too , without paying the Reckoning , but I found him there , and he said he had lost his Watch . My Master pursued her : I met him as he was bringing her back , and he told me she was got about 100 Yards towards Buckingham-House when he took her . She deny 'd that she had the Watch . Prisoner . I never deny 'd that I had it , for it was given me as a Pledge for a Guinea . Whitby . She did not pretend then that it was given her , but when he brought her into the Room to search her , I observ 'd that she kept down her right Arm , and examining under that Armpit , I felt the Watch , and said , Here it is ! But , says she , if you take it , I 'll swear a Robbery against you . Then the Prosecutor took it out of her Bosom . Prisoner . I had been but three Weeks in London , and was in St. James's-Park when the Prosecutor came up , and ask 'd if I was a Quaker ? No , Sir , says I . Why do you look so discontented ? says he ; Are you in Service ? No , Sir , I said again , but a Woman in Westminster has promis 'd to get me into one . Why , Child , says he , I am a Gentleman 's Butler , and can provide you with a Place if you will go along with me . The Gentleman being a Stranger I refused to go with him for a good while ; but at last , being willing to get into Business , I was over-persuaded , and he brought me to the View of Oxford , which I have since heard is a very ill House : There he began to be very rude , and offer 'd to put his - I am ashamed to speak it - his Hands up my Petticoats . - I gave him ! to understand , that if he did not behave himself civilly , and like a Gentleman , I would leave the Room . Whereof he said , he had not much Money about him , but if I would oblige him so and so , he would leave his Watch in my Hands till he help 'd me to a Guinea . I was in a great Straight what to do ; I was out of Service , and had no Money , nor any Acquaintance in Town , but Mr. Oakes and his Wife in Swallow-street , and so at last , when he had given me his Watch for a Pledge , I did let him have his Will to the full ; and after he had fulfill 'd his Desire , he asked me several odious , filthy Questions , which my Modesty will not let me repeat . Then I desir 'd him to take his Watch , and let me have the Guinea that he promis 'd me ; but he said , he had but a Shilling in his Pocket , and half of it must pay for the Wine , and a Groat for Cakes , and he would give me the rest . I told him Two-pence was very short of a Guinea . He said , if I would go and fetch some Rods to whip him , he would send for the Guinea . I told him I did not know what he meant by such Discourse , and that that was no Place to get Rods in ; and so I went out , and Mr. Figg follow 'd , and brought me in again . I did not deny the Watch , and Figg took it out of my right Bosom , and then they sent for Thomas Adams , the Constable , and hurry 'd me before Justice Robinson . C - B - . She says that I had to do with her , but upon my Honour I had no Design whatever upon her . Court . Do you use to pick up Women , and carry them into a private Room without any Design ? C - B - . I had no Design , upon Honour , for I have a Wife of my own , who is here in Court . And the Prisoner and I were in a publick Room . Court . The Drawer swears it was a private Room . Was any Body in the Room besides yourself and the Prisoner ? C - B - . No ; but upon my Honour it was a publick Room . I do n't know what other People may call publick ; but I think any Room must needs be publick , if it is in a Publick-House . I took the Watch from her myself , but I was very much suddled , and can not tell whether I took it out of her Bosom or from under her Arm . The Jury acquitted her . 41.

Gerrard Russel . Between 10 and 12 at Night , on Christmas-Eve , I had Occasion to go to - do - my Occasions . I had a pair of Breeches under my Arm besides those on my - those that I wore . And as I was couching down ( in Hanging-Sword-Alley in Fleet-street ) the Prisoner came up to me , and very immodestly put her Hand betwixt my Legs . The first thing that she laid hold on was my - my Watch-String , and she held it so fast , and Jugg 'd it so hard , that tho ' I catch 'd hold of it myself to save it , I thought in my Conscience she would have pull 'd it off - and so indeed she did at last [ for what could a Man do with such a Woman when his Breeches were down ? She got my Watch out , but the Hook of it hitch 'd in my Fob . Damn you , says she , I never had such a Tustle for a Watch in my Life ; and with that she gave me a punch , and push 'd me clever backwards , and then the Swivel broke , and away she run a-cross the Way . I got up , but had not Presence of Mind to cry Stop Thief ; and so she made off with my Watch , and I afterward , found the String in the Alley . She was three Minutes a struggling with me . Prisoner . How many Women did you charge with this Robbery before you charged me ? Russel . Nell Walker being of the same Size and having the same Voice , I charged the Constable with her ; but said she , it was not I , but Moll Skettlebank that took it , for I was but two Yards off when it was done , and as soon as I saw Moll , I knew her to be the Woman . Court . Did you see the Prisoner 's Face when you lost your Watch ? Russel . No ; but I know her by her Voice and Bulk . Court . You say that Eleanor Walker has the same Voice and Bulk , and how then do you know the Difference ? Russel I am sure that the Prisoner is the Woman . Prisoner . He charged the Constable with Mary James and Betty Gordon , as well as with Nell Walker and me . Russel . I do n't know that I charged any but Nell Walker . Eleanor Walker . I lodge at Mary James 's in Hanging-Sword Court . After he had charg 'd Betty Gordon , he came to my Lodgings , and seeing my Landlady , who is a very fat Woman , and has not been out of Doors these three Weeks . You Son of a Whore , says my Landlord , do you charge my Wife , who has had an Ague and Fever these three Weeks ? my Landlord called me down , I found the Prosecutor there , and Mr. Foquet the Constable ; says Mr. Foquet , is this the Woman ? Yes , says the Prosecutor , and with that I was frighted , and told them , that I passed to and fro in the Alley , I saw Mol l Skettlebank there in a Squabble ; then I went with them to the Crown next Door but one to us . Mr. Foquet . About 11 at Night , the Prisoner came the Watch-house , and I went with him next Day to Nell Walker , By God , says Nell , I 'll never swear for another , it was Moll Sketttlebank that took the Watch , and then ran over the Way to me . We went to Suttle-streets , her Husband Durrel said , he would enquire after it , but his Wife had moved her Lodgings . We could not find her all that Week ; but at last I met her Girls who runs at these Backey-houses , and threatened to send her to Roosewell ; for Fear of which , she told me , where to find the Prisoner . The Prosecutor first me with Mary James , and then with Nell Walker he said , she was such Woman as Mary James . The Jury acquitted her . 42. Peter Noakes , of St. Martin 's in the Field , was indicted for the Murder of William Turner . Gent , by discharging a Pistol loaden with Powder and Bullets , against the right Part of his Head , near the right Ear , and thereby giving him one mortal Wound of the breath of 1 Inch , and depth of 8 Inches , of which he instantly dy 'd , on the 7th of this Instant January . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's inquisition for the said Murder . Robert Nichols . I am Apprentice to Mr. Bently at the King's-Arms Tavern at Charing-Cross ; I do n't know at what Hour the Deceas 'd and the Prisoner came in , for I was busy in the Cellar , but I came up about 11 in the Morning . The Bell rung , and I went into the Room where the Deceas 'd and the Prisoner were : When I came in , the Prisoner was standing by the Fire-side , and the Deceas 'd was walking about . The Prisoner had me send to the Gunsmith for a pair of Pocket-Pistols with Powder and Bail . I went to the Bar , where John Simmons ( my Fellow-Servant ) was waiting for some Bread and Cheese , which the Deceas 'd had called for . I sent him to the Gunsmith 's , and carried in the Bread and Cheese myself , and leaving it there , I went and dress 'd myself : When I was dress 'd I went in again and stirred up the Fire . The Prisoner said to the Deceas 'd , Turner , Why do n't you send for your Sword ? the Deceas 'd answer 'd , You know the Reason why ; 't is because I have got no Money . And the Prisoner reply 'd , Damn your Blood , you know that I have Money enough . The Deceas 'd rung the Bell , and called for Pen , Ink , and Paper , which was brought , and I went out . I did not see the Pistols brought , but between 12 and 1 , as I was standing at the Street-Door ( which is a Pannel distant from the Door of the Room where the Deceas 'd and the Prisoner were ) I heard a Pistol go off , at which I was startded , and flew from the Door to the Kennel , and presently be thought myself of the Pistols that were sent for about an Hour and a half before . Council . Before the Pistol went off , did you hear any Noise in the Room like struggling ? Nichols . I heard a Noise in the Room just before like walking about , but not like struggling . Immediately after the Pistol went off , the Prisoner came out of the Room , and pulled the Door to , twice , to shut it ; He look 'd as white and as pale as Death , and came hastily out at the Street-Door . Council . Did any Body stand in his Way ? Nichols . There was an Oyster-girl putting up her Oysters at the Door ; he pushed her aside , but did not push her down , and then made his Way up Church-Court . Council . Did he run ? Nichols . No ; he stagger 'd , and seem 'd to be so frighted that he could not run . My Master presently came to the Door , and asked which Way he went ? I told him , and he order 'd the Potter to pursue . My Master and the Porter run up the Court , but return 'd and said , they could not see him . Council . Do you know why they called for Pen and Ink ? Nichols . The Porter told me it was to send for a Sword . Council . Who did you see in the Room when you first went in ? Nichols . No Body but the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd ; but the other Drawer told me there had been a Woman with them before I came . Council . Did you go into the Room soon after the Pistol went off ? Nichols . Yes ; in less than a Minute : The Deceas 'd was sitting on the Ground betwixt two Chairs , with his Back against the Window ; his right Hand was near his Knee , and the Pistol lying on the Ground , within two or three Inches of his right Hand , with the Cock next his Hand , and the Muzzle from him . I saw Blood run out at his right Ear . Prisoner . The first Time you went into the Room , did you not observe Mr. Turner , the Deceas 'd , walking in a melancholly-mad Posture ? Nichols . When I first went in , he was walking gravely , and the second time he was singing . Prisoner . Did not I come out of the Room before you got off of the Steps at the Door ? Nichols . I was by the Kennel-side when I first saw you come out , and pull the Door to , twice . William Bently , Master of the King's-Arms Tavern . I did not see the Prisoner come into my House , but about 11 o'Clock I saw him come out of the Room and hand Mrs. Falkingham into a Coach , and then return into the Room . I was not in the Room all the Time , till the Deceas 'd was Dead . My Drawer told me , that two Gentlemen had order 'd a pair of Pistols , and then , and not before , I knew that there were two in the Room . I was in the Kitchen when the Pistol went off , and my Cook said , I 'll be hang 'd if they have not shot one another . My Cook ran immediately and open 'd the Door ; I followed and looked in , and seeing the Deceas 'd lying on the Ground , I flew after the Prisoner ; I run up Church-Court with all Expedition , but could not get Sight of him ; when I return 'd I found the Deceas 'd sitting on the Ground , his Head leaning to the left Side , which was towards that Side of the Room where the Door was , and the Blood was streaming from the Wound . Council . When the Prisoner handed Mrs. Falkingham into the Coach , did you see any Sword that she had with her ? Mr. Bently . No . Council . Had the Deceas 'd any Sword on after he was shot ? Mr. Bently . I saw none ; and I do n't know of any Alteration that was made in the Room from the Time he was shot to the Time I returned from pursuing the Prisoner , which was but very short ; and when I came back I lock 'd up that Door , leaving every thing in the same Condition as I found it . Prisoner . Was the Deceas'd 's Back close to the Wainscot ? Mr. Bently . Yes ; quite close Prisoner . Was his Back to the Window or his Face ? Mr. Bently . His Back . Prisoner . If his Face had been towards the Window when he received the Wound could he have turned himself about after wards ? Mr. Bently . No . Prisoner . Did Mrs. Falkingham or the Deceas 'd send for me ? Mr. Bently . I know nothing of that but what my Servants told me . John Simmonds , Servant to Mr. Bently . On Friday Morning , the 7th of this Month , the Deceas 'd , and Mrs. Falkingham came in a Coach to my Master 's . I shew 'd them into a Fore-Room . The Prisoner came an Hour afterwards , and went to them ; I carried them in a Pint of White Wine , the Deceas 'd call 'd for Bread and Cheese , and the Prisoner said , Do n't bring a Knife with it . Before I could carry it in they rung again , and Robert Nichols ( my Fellow 'Prentice ) went in , and coming out again , order 'd me to go to a Gunsmith 's , and bid him bring a Brace of small Pistols , with Powder and Ball . I left the Bread and Cheese for Nichols to carry in , and went to speak for the Pistols . The Gunsmith 's young Man came with a Pair , and carry 'd them in ; but I do n't know how long he staid , for I did not see him come out again . The Bell was rung again , I went in , and the Deceas 'd bid me go and see why the Gunsmith did not make haste with the other Pistols ; I went , and met his Man coming down Lancaster-Court with a larger Pair , which he carry 'd into the Room . This is one of them . Mr. Bently . And it is the Same that I took from the Side of the Deceas 'd ; here is still some Hair of the Perriwig sticking to the Muzzle , between the Stock and the Barrel ; and this is the Wig that the Deceas 'd then wore , the Hair is a little sindged on the Right-side . Prisoner to Simmonds . Did the Deceas 'd order you to bring a Knife with the Bread and Cheese ? Simmonds . No . Prisoner . Is it not usual to bring a Knife without Orders ? Simmonds . Yes . Jane Thrasher . I am 'Prentice with Mrs. Goldfinch , a Child 's Coat and Mantua-Maker , in Johnson 's Court , in Fleet-Street . Mrs. Falkingham lodges at our House . On Thursday the 6th of this Month , about 2 in the Afternoon , Mr. Hiller and the Deceas 'd came to Mrs. Falkingham 's ; they went away again , and return 'd in about half an Hour . The Deceas 'd came about 5 ; between 5 and 6 Mr. Hiller and he quarrel 'd prodigiously , they had very high Words , and talked of going to fight the next Day . The Prisoner desir 'd them to be Friends , and not talk of Fighting . With much ado he persuaded them to agree , and they appear 'd to be pretty well reconcil 'd about Six , and sent for a Bottle of Wine , and drank to one another , and all was like to be well . I went into the Parlour , and soon after Mr. Hiller came down , and went away . It was not long before I heard a fresh Noise above ; I went up and found them all 3 standing , the Prisoner , the Deceas 'd , and Mrs. Falkingham . The Prisoner said , Sir , ( or Damn you , Sir , I do n't know which ) bring Sword and Pistol ; and the Deceas 'd answer 'd , I 'll come ready arm 'd . With that I came down , and they all 3 soon follow 'd , and the 2 Men went into the Court , and began to quarrel and make a Noise . The Deceas 'd was standing near the Door , and the Prisoner walking at a Distance . I desir 'd them , if they had any thing to say , that they would come in , and not speak so loud to make a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood . The Deceas 'd would not come in , but the Prisoner did , tho ' he presently went out again , and then they went together down the Court , and thro ' the Arch that leads to Gough's-Square . Neither of them had Sword or Pistol . Mrs. Falkingham said , they were going to fight , and sent me after them to bring them back . I took hold of the Prisoner 's Arm , and desir 'd him to return , but he forc 'd himself from me , and went forward . The Deceas 'd follow 'd , and in going I heard him Name the Word Whore ; but who he meant I do n't know . Between 8 and 9 I went down into the Kitchin , and found the Deceased walking about in great Disorder , and beating his Breast in a violent Passion . I asked him what was the Matter ? He struck his Hand very hard upon his Breast , and said , You can not tell ; but it lies here - Damn her ! she has done her worst , for she has set two Men to kill me . He named no Names , but I thought by the Word her , he might mean Mrs. Falkingham . Council . It seems the Deceased was there late and early , did he lodge at Mrs. Falkingham 's ? Thrasher . No ; Mrs. Falkingham is a married Woman , and has lodged at our House 3 quarters of a Year . Mr. Hiller used to come to see her sometimes , but he has not been so long acquainted with her as the other two . The Prisoner used to come oftner than Mr. Hiller , but the Deceased frequented the House more than both of 'em . Mrs. Falkingham hearing what a Passion the Deceased was in , came down . He made a great Noise at her , so that she said she would go out , that she might prevent a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood . He begg 'd her to stay , because , he said , Mr. Noakes ( the Prisoner ) was coming . She told him she 'd stay for no Noakes , but go directly . His Sword lay in the Kitchin ; she bid me take care of it , and lay it in her Room ; and if Mr. Noakes came , to tell him they were gone to the King's-Arms in the Strand . The Prisoner came about an Hour after , and asked-if Mrs. Falkingham was within ? I told him , No ; she was gone with Mr. Turner ( the Deceased ) to the King's-Arms Tavern . He said , Very well : And seemed dubious whether he should go to them or not , and did not appear to be resolved when he went away . Council . Had the Prisoner a Sword on then ? Thrasher . I am not certain ; but about 11 , or later , a Porter brought this Letter to me . Clerk reads . 'To Mrs. Thrasher , at Mrs. 'Goldfinches , in Johnson 's Court , Fleetstreet . 'Mrs . Thrasher , ' I desire you would be so kind to send by 'the Bearer , my Sword and Belt , and you 'will oblige your humble Servant , W . Turner . Thrasher . I remembered what had hapned over Night , and asked the Porter if there was any Quarrel between the Gentlemen ? and he said , No . The Porter came again before One , and enquir 'd what was the Gentleman 's Name who sent for the Sword ? I ask 'd him his Reason , and he told me he was shot . Then I directed him where he might hear of the Gentleman 's Friends . Council . Did you let the Prisoner know that you had carried the Deceased 's Sword into Mrs. Falkingham 's Chamber .
