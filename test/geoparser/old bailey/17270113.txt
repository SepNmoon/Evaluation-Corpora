The Prisoner came to help Wash as usual , and immediately , was for going up Stairs ; whereupon my Wife bid her keep to the Washing-Tub : In a little Time the Prisoner attempts to go up Stairs again , and my Wife desired to know what Business she had up Stairs ? She said , to see for some foul Linen ; my Wife told her the Maid could fetch that down , and bid her keep to washing : But the Prisoner 's making such Excuses to go up Stairs , made my Wife suspect that she must be the Person that came at my Money , upon that I goes up Stairs , unlocks my Draw where I kept my Money , and counts it over very carefully , and put Twenty three Guineas in one Bag , and laid that at the Bottom of the Drawer , and put the Moidores , some half Broads and a new French Pistole in another Bag , and lays that near the Top of the Drawer , then came down , and my Wife sends the Prisoner up Stairs with a Petticoat that was below ; the Prisoner carried it up and comes down again presently , upon which I goes up Stairs again , and found my Drawer lockt as usual , I unlockt it , and took out the Bag which had the odd Gold in it , and mist the new Pistole , then I took the other Bag and told over the Guineas , which I found exactly right : I acquainted my Wife and my Son how it was , and then order 'd the Prisoner to go up Stairs and brush her young Master 's Cloths ; my Son taxed her with the Theft , the Prisoner denied it , and offered to be search 'd , but first put her Hand in her Pocket and took out the Pistole , and endeavoured to conceal it in her Hand , but my Son perceiving it , he took hold of her Hand , her little Finger being closed , and found the Pistole under it ; then the Prisoner said she found it in the Room , but I being in a Passion , told her she was a lying B - h , and that she took it out of my Drawer .

James Lawson thus depos 'd . On the 18th of December I was going along Cornhill between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock at Night , and the Prisoner desired me to go and drink with her ; so we went to the Salutation Alehouse in Bell-Yard , and going up Stairs the Prisoner sate down at the End of the Table , and I sate down at the Side , and my Money was in my Left Pocket , for I had taken it out of my right side Pocket and put it into the Left after I came into the Room , and had only some Farthings in my right Pocket , but after we had been Drinking and - and I went to change a Guinea to pay the Reckoning , indeed I was in Drink , but not so drunk neither but I can be sure the Prisoner had pickt my Pocket , for my Guineas were gone , and I desired the Prisoner to give me them back again , but she would not , so I stopt her , and spoke to the Landlord to call a Constable .

Between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock the Man of the House sent for me from the Watch-house in Bishopsgate-street , and when I came there I saw the Prisoner in Liquor , but she denied she had the Money , and asked me to search her , but I told her I had not Impudence enough to search her ; however , afterwards she desired me to go up Stairs with her , and then she shewed me the Money , and said that she would give me Half a Guinea to make it up with the Prosecutor : I asked the Prisoner how she came by that Money , the Prisoner told me she Cribb 'd it ; I took the Money from the Prisoner and have it here . The Prisoner thus made her Defence . I was going along Cornhill , near the Royal-Exchange , and the Prosecutor asked me to go and drink with him , I denied him at first , but afterwards went along with him to this Alehouse ; I own I am an unfortunate Woman , and live by keeping Company , but never wronged Man , Woman or Child in my Life , but only what Gentlemen please to give me ( and what can be freer than Gift ? ) and when the Constable came I offered to be searched , and told him if I had such Money about me it was the Prosecutor 's , and that he must give it me among some Half-pence which he gave me to buy a Bunch of Rods , for we were both drunk , and I did not mind what he gave me . I asked him what I was to do with the Rods , and he said he wanted to be Flogg 'd , but the Man of the House said he would not suffer any such doings in his House , and then the Prosecutor sent for a Constable , who carried us both to the computer .

He was a second Time indicted on the Statute of Stabbing . He was a third Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for Murther . Humphrey Toms thus depos 'd . Edward Perry ( the Deceased ) and his Wife and I , were going cross St. James 's Park on Wednesday was a Fortnight , between 7 and 8 o'Clock in the Evening , to see Mary Pool a little Way home ; Edward Perry and I were foremost about 20 or 30 Yards when we met the Prisoner , who past us and meddled with Mary Pool ; upon which Mrs. Perry cry 'd out , and we went back to see what was the Matter , and Edward Perry asked the Prisoner why he meddled with the Women ; upon which the Prisoner drew his Sword and stuck him , I saw the Pass , saw the Push given , and was within a Yard of the Deceased when he fell , crying out I am a dead Man ; neither the Deceased or my self had either Sword or Stick , nor was there any Offence given to the Prisoner , only the Deceased asked him why he meddled with the Women , but never once lifted up his Hand against the Prisoner . Mr. James Pringle the Surgeon depos 'd . That he went to see the Deceased the next Morning after the Wound was given , and found it to be mortal , and that it was done with a Sword , which went in at the 5th Rib on the Right Side , and came out between the 6th and 7th Rib on the Left , and that it had all the Symptoms of being mortal , insomuch that he did not expect the Deceased could have lived Forty eight Hours , notwithstanding he lived 14 Days ; and that after he was dead he opened him , and found it had penetrated the Diaphragma , or Midriff , and through the Left Lobe of the Lungs . Ann Perry thus depos 'd . Going over St. James 's Park between 7 and 8 o'Clock at Night , my Husband and Humphrey Tonis were before us , and Mary Pool and I followed at a little Distance , the Prisoner passed my Husband and Humphry Toms , but when he came to us laid hold of Mary Pool about the Neck and Throat , in such a Manner as it he wanted to strangle her , more than to salute her ; upon which I called to my Husband , who came back , and only ask 'd why he did so ? the Prisoner gave no Answer but drew his Sword , and thrust it through my Husband 's Body in such a violent Manner , that the Point of the Sword penetrated my Thumb so that it festred for near a Week afterwards ; my Husband had neither Stick nor Sword , nor so much as offered to lift up his Hand against the Prisoner , but cried out he was a dead Man . The Prisoner made off , and I called out to the Centry , but they did not stop him . Mary Pool thus depos 'd . I having been at Edward Perry 's House in Long-ditch in Corkcutter 's Alley , Edward Perry , Ann Perry , and Humphrey Toms , went to see me Part of my Way home ; and as we came near Story's-Gate , the Men being before us , the Prisoner took hold of me and almost choak 'd me , and laid his Mouth to mine ; what he intended I know not , for I was so much frighted that the first Words I heard was from Edward Perry ; who cried out he was a dead Man . Edward Perks thus depos 'd . I was coming cross the Park , and before I came to the Chapel I heard a great Noise , and just as I came up to them I heard a Person say he was a dead Man : I assisted to carry the Deceased to the Angel , his Wife taking him by one Arm , and I the other , he being unable to walk ; I staid there and saw his Wounds dressed , but the Doctor did not search both Wounds , and the Woman said her Husband was a dead Man . The Serjeant depos 'd . That when he heard what had happened , he sent for Dr. Pringle , who was their own Surgeon , and when the Deceased came to his Speech , he declared he had no Sword with him . The Prisoner in his Defence said , He did not draw his Sword , but that Toms followed him , assaulted him and beat him , and that Perry gave him several Strokes with a Stick . Bryan Higgins depos 'd . That on Wednesday was a Fortnight the Prisoner and he coming from their Quarters to their Lodgings in Thieving-Lane , Westminster , between 7 and eight o'Clock at Night , they met some Soldiers and pass 'd them , and afterwards met the Women , and the Prisoner went to kiss them , and the Man which is dead turned about and struck him cross the Head and Shoulders , and swore D - n his Soul he would see him out , and that he pushed 3 or 4 Times at the Prisoner near Story's-Gate , and that the Prisoner retreated , and that Toms had no Sword , but he had a Stick , and that Perry had a Sword ; but this Deponent having neither Sword nor Stick , did not care to go between two drawn Swords , and that they were not long about it . Thomas Osborn thus depos 'd . Coming home from my Quarters with the Prisoner , we met the Deceased and Toms and pass 'd them , and afterwards met the Women , but did not know that they belonged to them , Ann Perry called out , and Toms came back and gave Hains a Stroke over the Back with a Stick , then struck him over the Head and made him reel : Hains asked him what that was for , but I saw no Sword drawn on either Side , but Toms said he would see him out . Corporal Davis depos 'd . That the second Night after the Deceased was wounded he went to see him , and asked him how he did , who answer 'd but indifferent , and told him he was very weak ; then asked his Wife how this Affair happened , she told him the Prisoner took the Woman about the Neck and almost strangled her , and upon that she called to her Husband , who came back , and the Prisoner wounded him in a most barbarous Manner ; upon which the Deceased said , hold your Tongue , for I believe we were all fuddled , and added , that he hoped he should recover for his own Sake and for the young Man 's Sake , that he forgave him although he had neither Stick nor Sword . Serjeant Hare thus depos 'd . The Night the Quarrel happened they had pursued the Prisoner home to my House , the Prisoner had a naked Sword in his Hand , and they said he had killed a Man , upon which I took the Sword from him , and carried him to the Tilt-Yard . The Prisoner had his Regimental Coat on , and there was a Hole in the Right Side of it , and his Thumb was cut and all bloody , and he complained that he got it in a Quarrel with the Deceased ; his Sword I delivered to Charles Moody , a Drum in the Company I belong to ; the Prisoner has lodged at my House near five Months , in the same Room with Thomas Osborn and Bryan Higgins ; he always kept good Hours , and was not given to Quarrel . Corporal Smith thus depos 'd During the Prisoner 's Confinement in the Tilt-Yard I saw his Coat and Wastecoat , which seemed to be run through with a Sword , I likewise saw his Thumb bound up with a Handkerchief , but had not the Curiosity to see in what Manner it was wounded : The Prisoner was 8 Months with me in the Barracks in the Tower , and was always a quiet Fellow , and always declined and avoided Quarrels . Colonel Williamson thus depos 'd . The Prisoner is the Son of an old Soldier that is now disabled , and his Father requested me to do something for his Son , I told him that I could not at present , but recommended him to Colonel Price 's Regiment , but advised him to take no Bounty Money , and then when any Thing better offer 'd he might the easier get a Discharge ; the Prisoner is a pretty good Scholar , and understands Latin , and during his being at the Tower , which was near a Year , he behaved so well that I gave him the liberty to come into my Kitchen , and he always appeared to be a very modest Fellow ; and for wearing a Sword it is a standing Order , that no Soldier shall be Seen in the Street without his Sword on , which makes me believe the Deceased might have a Sword . Some of the Evidences for the Prisoner directly contradicting what had been sworn in favour of the Deceased , the Court thought it necessary to ask the former Evidence some further Questions ; upon which Ann Perry declared , She saw no Body with the Prisoner , not any Company pass by , but only stragling or single Persons , and that she neither saw Osborn or Higgins to her Knowledge , and that there was no Violence offer 'd to the Prisoner , neither did Toms give any Blow . Humphrey Toms declared , That he saw no Person with the Prisoner , and that he knew Higgins and Osborn by fight , but they were not there . Edward Perks said , That he help 'd to carry the Deceased to his Lodgings , and that he saw neither Sword nor Stick , nor had the Deceased so much as his Sword Belt on . The Prisoner 's Coat and Wastcoat were produced in Court and shown to the Jury , but upon Examination , the Holes in the Coat and Wastcoat did not correspond , being on contrary sides of the Body . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of all the Indictments . Death . John Morgan , alias Morley , of the Parish of St. Mildred Breadstreet , was indicted for stealing 30 Guineas , 1 Half Guinea , 13 Moidores , a Quarter Moidore , 2 Broad Pieces value 23 Shillings each , one Half Broad , value 11 Shillings and 6 d. and seven Pounds in Money , out of the Dwelling-House of Humphrey Brearly Decemb . 3 . Humphrey Brearly thus depos 'd . I keep the Crown and Cushion Tavern in Breadstreet , and having occasion to sit up late , I sent all the Servants to Bed , and before I went to Bed , which was about 3 o'Clock in the Morning , I put my Money into a little Drawer and locked it up in a Side Cupboard that is in a Room behind the Bar , then lock 'd the Room Door , and went to Bed ; about eight o'Clock my Maid came up and told me the Room behind the Bar was broke open ; upon which I got up and found it true , then goes to the Side Cupboard where I had put my Money , and found it was all gone but Six-pence ; the Prisoner , who was my Porter , had double locked the Door and threw away the Key in the Street , and a strange Porter took it up and let us out : I had advertised the Prisoner in several News Papers , and by an Advertisement in the Gazette , he was taken at Guilford , and confined there ; when he came before the Mayor he confessed the Fact and signed his own Confession . Eleanor Smith , Servant to Mr. Brearly thus depos 'd . I got up between 7 and 8 o'Clock in the Morning , Decemb . 3. and asked for the Porter , but he was not to be found , the Iron Bar of the Door was taken down , and the Door was double locked , so that we could not get out till a Porter who found the Key in the Street opened the Door ; the Room behind the Bar was broke open , and there lay a little Key and 2 Iron Skewers , I was frighted , called my Master and gave him the Key , and he found he was robb 'd . Radcliff West thus depos 'd . I went with Mr. Brearly to Guilford , and when the Prisoner was brought before the Mayor he confessed he had robbed his Master of the Money , upwards of Sixty Pounds , which Money was told over there . Another Evidence depos 'd . That he went with Mr. Scullard to the New Goal in Southwark when the Prisoner was brought there , and asked him if any other Person advised him to commit this Robbery , and the Prisoner said no Person advised him to it , nor did he think of doing it when he first got up , but said he believed the Devil put him upon it , and that he was very sorry for it . The Prisoner confessed the Fact in Court , and the Jury found him guilty of the Indictment . Death .

Sarah Cooper thus depos 'd . The Prisoner is an Orange Woman at the Old Play-house , and I have often bought Oranges of her , and I invited her to come and drink Tea with me ; she used to talk of a pretty Child that she had , and asked if she might bring her with her , I told her she might , and about , five o'Clock in the Evening the Prisoner came and brought her Child with her ; she had been come but a little while before she desired to see my Watch , that she might know what it was a Clock , for she must go to the Play-house early , because there would be a full House ; I sent my Maid for my Watch , told her what a Clock it was , and said it down on the Table , then asked the Prisoner to drink a Glass of Wine , she said if it was burnt she should approve of it very well ; upon which I ordered my Maid to burn it , and she drank 2 or 3 Glasses and then was for going , but said , that if the Child would not be troublesome , she would leave her with me a little while , I told her not at all : She went out and returned again in about half an Hour , my Watch still lying upon the Table , I asked her to come to the Fire , but she would not , but sate down by the Table where the Watch lay ; after a short Stay she said she must go to the House , but would leave the Child with me , the Prisoner was no sooner gone but I miss 'd my Watch , and when my Maid came , who I had sent for a Knot and a Tart for the Child , we searched the Room but could find no Watch ; her Child which was about six Years old said , Do n't be frighted , Mamma put your Watch in her Pocket , but she will give it you again . I called a Neighbour and told him I had lost my Watch , and sent my Maid for Mrs. Burgis , to tell her I must speak with her , she came about 7 o'Clock , and I asked her , why she had played the Rogue with my Watch , she denied having meddled with it , upon which I told her she should go before a Justice , and then she desired she might send for a Cloak , and a Hoop-petticoat , and whispered to a Person that I did not know , and that came in without being sent for , who went and fetched her what she wanted ; when they came she was a pretty while in putting them on just at a Corner of the Room , near which there was some old Pattens , she pretended her Shoe was unbuckled , or her Garter untied , upon which she stooped down for a little Time : And after we had been before the Justice , and knocked up all the Pawnbrokers thereabout to enquire if the Watch had been offer 'd to them , could hear nothing of it , the Watch was found under an old Patten , with the Cristial downward , just by the Place where the Prisoner made an Excuse to stoop , notwithstanding that the Pattens had been removed , and the Place strictly searched before . The Prisoner thus made her Defence . The Prosecutor invited me to drink Tea and Breakfast with her , and desired I would bring my Girl with me , I went one Morning about 10 o'Clock , and asked her Maid if her Mistress was within , she said yes , but she was in Bed with a Gentleman ; I went another Morning , and then a Gentleman 's Footman came to the Door , and I suppose she was in Bed with his Master . So hearing she kept such bad Hours , that she seldom got up before four or five a Clock in the Afternoon , I went in the Evening about Five a Clock , and found the Prosecutor dressing of her Head , she asked me to drink a Glass of Wine , and I believe I might drink two Glasses of French Wine burnt , I enquired what a Clock it was , and the Watch was fetched and said down on the Table , I did not stay long , but went out and came again , and told her if my Child would not be thought troublesome I would leave her while I went to the Playhouse , which she seemed very well pleased with ; I went away , and after some Time Mrs. Cooper sent for me from the Playhouse , and when I came she asked me why I had played the Rogue with her Watch , I , as very well I might , denied it , and they were for searching me , and I gave them leave to strip me naked ( the Constable promising to look out at Window ) this was in her own Room , and they did search me , and after they had so done and carried me before the Justices I was admitted to Bail , the Constable that was then charged with me , came the next Morning and told me he had News to tell me , for the Watch was found , and all further Proceedings would be stopt . Margaret Colebrook thus depos 'd . The Prisoner is a very honest Woman . I never heard any Ill of her , and when she was confin 'd , Whitehead , declared he had made a strict Search in the Prosecutor 's Room , but could find no Watch , and that she staid with the Prisoner till between 12 and 1 o'Clock .

Mary Kinerly thus depos 'd . Katherine Southall was my Servant , I was not within when she went out , but when she came in she was in a vile Condition all over dirty - I asked her where she had been , she said , to buy some Cheese : However , I sent for this Fellow 's Mistress , and we took the Girl into a private Room in the back Part of the House , and examined her very strictly , and made her undress herself ; and observing what a Condition she was in , I asked her where she had been , and she said , ( crying before his Mistress and my self ) the Prisoner took her to Ivy Bridge , which is a very dirty Place , and there he had to do with her against her Will - ; about Half an Hour after this , I went to a Cellar where my Husband was at work , ( not the Cellar the Prisoner used to frequent ) and I told him that some Man had done something to our Girl which he ought to be punished for ; the Prisoner was there drinking Geneva , but I did not know it when I spoke , and he was telling some Soldiers that he longed for a Maidenhead , and by G - d he had got one , and swore the Girl was 16 Years of Age , and as fit for Business as I was ; after this , I got a Warrant from Justice Harper , gave it to a Constable and took the Prisoner . Sarah Kinman ( Midwife ) thus depos 'd . When this Girl 's Mother came to me , she desired me to search her Daughter ; and upon searching her I found a Man had had to do with her , but I ca n't say that her Condition was any otherways than what it might have been upon such an Occasion , if no Violence had been used to her ; but for my Part , I could never have been persuaded or deluded to it in such a dirty Place .

Katherine Southall used to come after me to our Cellar , and would be always giving me Apples or Oranges , or one Thing or another : and I asked her to lend me Six-pence , and she sent it me ; I asked her for a Quartern of Gin , and she gave it me ; and she asked me to hang her Windows on for her , and I did it , then she asked me if I would drink a Pint of Beer , and I went along with her ; and when we came out I asked her to lie with me , and she consented , and came along with me , and took up her Gown Tail that it might not be dirty ; and when it was over I asked her to send me a Shilling , and she lent it me ; and then said , what shall I say to my Mistress that my Cap is so dirty , I 'll not tell her that I have been with you , but I will tell her that a drunken Man run against me and threw me down in the Dirt ; the Place is not above five Yards distance from the Strand , and there were People passing by in the Time .

The 17th of November I went to to my Office and found a Letter directed to me , which I could not very well read , but found it related to some unwarrantable Proceedings in my Family ; and going home about 5 o'Clock , I found my Wife 's two Sisters , then asked the Maid where her Mistress was , she answered , gone to Mr. Middleton 's : I went to Mr. Middleton 's , but they did not Dine at home that Day ; she had called there but did not stay , but had been at Cunningham 's Lodgings . On Saturday Morning I went out of Town , and left Word that I should not come home that Night , but came home sooner ; and in the Stables saw two strange Fellows : And there used to be so many Irishmen about my House , I ordered that no Body should come there without my Knowledge ; my Wife complained that it was very strange , if she nor her Sisters must have no Body come to them . I stay 'd at home all Day on Sunday , and about 10 o'Clock at Night as I was at Supper with my Wife and her Sister , Joseph Hunt , my Groom , desired to speak with me , I went out , and he desired me to take care of my self , for I was to be murthered to Night , and in the Stable I should find Mary Walthoe , my Wife 's Maid who would tell me more ; I went to her , and she said I should be murthered , and that her Mistress had a Pistol in her Pocket now , and that her Cloaths were all packed up , in order for her going away between Twelve and Two : I found the Cloaths packt up . Upon which , I said to my Coachman , Richard , will you stand by me ? He answered , he would , I went to a Gentleman to desire his assistance , but he was out of Town ; I went to see for my own Pistols , but they were not to be found , for they had been carried away to Mr. Cunningham .

One of the Maids I sent to watch above Stairs at the Window , said , they were come ; and presently after I heard a Noise at my Door , as if some Body had been unlocking of it ; I rush 'd our , saw the Prisoner at the Bar about eight Foot from my Door , making haste over the Ways ; I followed him and seized him by the Collar , and turning his Face to a Light , I saw it was the Prisoner , and pushed him from me , and told him he was not the Villain I wanted , ( had it been Cunninghams , I believe I should have shot him , for I had a Pistol charged in my Hand ) turning back I heard a Noise , and as I thought , saw Cunningham go off ; I pursued him down the Street , but could not find him ; when I came back my Coachman had seized the Prisoner , who had come back to my Door and drawn his Sword then he talked of having Satisfaction of the little Man in black , but I heard him say nothing of it before .

The first Knowledge I had of this Affair was but about a Week before this happened ; for going into Hertfordshire with my Mistress , Mrs. Benson , to see the Child , we came back to the Crown at Ware in the Evening , and I saw two strange Horses in the Stable , and at Supper-time , sitting in the Kitchen , I saw one Clouds , who I mistrusted was Cunningham 's Servant ; and we drank Wine together , but he would not let me pay any Thing : In the Morning I put my Mistress forward to go home , and we baited at the Old Bell at Edmonton , as soon as we got there comes Mr. Cunningham and Clouds ; Cunningham goes in a Doors , and Clouds comes to me ; we drank Wine again , and he ordered the Foot-Boy might not come into our Company , and would not let me pay any Thing : When I got upon my Box he gave me 10 Shillings , I thanked them , but did not know what it was for .

That the Prisoner at the Bar came to the House the Monday before this happened , and agreed with her for a Lodging for a Gentleman that would be private ; and that there would not be above two or three Persons come to him : And I insisted that no Woman should come to him , being cautious in that respect for the Reputation of my House . And the next Day after the Gentleman came , he invited me to Dine with him , and told me he was in Debt , and desired I would not let any Bailiff in , and the Prisoner used to be with him every Night .
