She was a second Time indicted on the Statute of Stabbing , and a third Time on the Coroner 's Inquest . Elias Mealing . On Friday was seven-night , between 6 and 7 in the Evening , as the Deceas 'd and I and his Son , a Child about 8 Years old , were going to Hampstead , we went into the House of John Andrews , where we found the Prisoner sitting in a Chair , and eating a Pear ; we call 'd for a Quartern of Liquor . The Deceas 'd sat down by the Prisoner , and gave her a Dram , and she gave each of us a Pear , and then she got up and stood against the Wall , just by where Andrews was sitting upon his Seat at work - he makes Leather-Clogs . The Deceas 'd went to her , and said , My dear , I 'll have a Kiss . And in a Minute or two , he flew back , and cry 'd , O Lord ! O Lord ! I 'm stabb 'd ! He had a Loin of Mutton in his Lap , I took it from him , and saw that he was wounded in the Thigh . I did not see any Knife in her Hand , but a Knife drop 'd from her side upon Mr. Andrews 's Seat , and it was bloody . There was no Quarrel betwixt them , nor one Word of Anger , nor did the Deceas 'd offer any Rudeness to her ; he only said he would kiss her , but did not kiss her then , tho ' he had kiss 'd her before when she sat in the Chair . John Andrews . While I was at work the Prisoner came and stood by me at the Window . I said , Stand aside if you ca n't be quiet ; for the Deceas 'd had been playing with her . Then she came down behind my Right-hand , and presently I heard the Deceas 'd cry , I am stabb 'd ! I turn 'd about and saw the Blood run , but saw no Knife in her Hand . The Child said , She has thrown it on your Seat ; and there I found it bloody . I had us 'd it at my work about an Hour before , and left it upon my Seat ; but did not see her take it up , nor did I hear any Words pass betwixt her and the Deceas 'd . John Gassen . When I came in , the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd were sitting together , and he bob 'd the Rump of a Loin of Mutton against her Apron and her Breast . They drank together , and then she went to the other side of the Room , and he follow 'd her , and in three Minutes , he cry 'd , Lord she has stabb 'd me ! He had his Hand upon her Shoulder , but did not offer any Rudeness , nor were there any Words between them at that time . He had kiss 'd her before she got up , but there was no Anger , nor struggling upon that Account , for she liked it well enough . The Child call 'd out to his Uncle Mealing , O Uncle , she has dropp 'd the Knife , and then I saw the Knife bloody on Andrews 's Seat . Mr. Kersey , Surgeon . The Wound enter 'd the upper Part of the Thigh , a little below the Groin , and divided the crural Artery , so that the Wound was Mortal ; for the Deceas 'd lost so much Blood , that it was impossible to save his Life . I said to the Prisoner , Was it not barbarous to stab the Man thus ? And she answered , Tho ' I did stab him , it was but in jest . I reply 'd , You will not much care to be hang 'd for your Jest . Who heard me say that I stabb 'd him ? Says she . Why I did , you impudent Jade , says I. I have heard that she and two or three more Women like her self used to resort to Hornsey-Lane . Prisoner . I was eating a Pear when they came in . They call 'd for Gin and Anniseed , and gave me a Dram ; I got up and took up the Knife to pate a Pear . The Deceas 'd bob 'd at me with a Rump of Mutton , and went to put his Hands under my Coats . I gave him a push and bid him stand away , and some how he run against the Knife , and I did not know he was wounded 'till he cry 'd out . Meally . She had then no Pear in her Hand , for she gave me the last . Prisoner . No , I had another . Three or Four Women appear 'd to the Prisoners Character , and deposed they had known her a great many Years ; that she sold Fruit , was a very honest and industrious quiet peaceable Women , and never inclin 'd to passion , and they had never heard any thing amiss in her Character . Justice - She has a most infamous Character , she and her Companions are the common Pest of the Place . I have had several Informations against them ; they make it their common practice to lie in Highgate-lane , and expose their Bodies to all comers for a Penny or Two-pence a time . They found her guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 5. George Turner , was indicted for the Murder of Ann Croft , by forcing a Horse on which he rode to run against her , by which means the Horse threw her down , and with his Feet kick 'd her on the Head , and thereby gave her several mortal Wounds and Bruises in the Head , on the 1st of August last ; of which Wounds and Bruises she languish 'd till the 8th Day of the same Month , and then dy 'd . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's inquisition for Manslaughter . John Corder . On the 1st of August I saw the Prisoner come riding over Fulham-bridge , and turn up Bear-street , which is the High-street in Fulham . He rid a full Gallop as fast as his Horse could well go . In turning the Corner going into Bear-street he had like to have rid over a Maid who was leading two Children . One of the Children fell down , but whether the Horse kick 'd the Child or no I ca n't tell . On the Child 's falling he look 'd back , and then whipt his Horse forward . I stood then at the King's-Arm Door which faces Bear-street . Prisoner . Did not the Horse run away with me ? Corder . No , I saw you whip him . John Goodwin . After the Prisoner turn 'd the Corner by the Church-bridge , he whipt his Horse into Bear-street as hard as he could go , for he was presently out of sight , though he came a great pace before he turn 'd the Corner . Robert South . As I was going up the Town with a piece of Timber on my Shoulder , the Deceas 'd was crossing the way ; and the Prisoner came Riding full speed from the Corner of Bear Street ; and at 9 or 10 Yards distance from the Deceas 'd , he call 'd out to her to get out of the way . She endeavour 'd to do so as fast as she could ; but instead of that , as it happen 'd , she got more in the way , for the Horse jumpt out of the Track ; and taking a wheel towards the Posts in the Path-way , ran against the Deceas 'd and beat her down ; and his Hind-Leg catch 'd in her Petticoats and threw him upon his Knees . This was about 20 Yards from the Corner turning out of Bear-Street , and I believe 200 Yards from the Church-bridge - My Face was not towards the Prisoner when he first call 'd out . Peter Osgood . I stood at the King's-Arms Door : The Prisoner rid up Bear-Street , and when he came over against Dr. Dwight 's Door , which is about 20 Yards from where I was , he gave the Horse 2 or 3 cuts , though I thought the Horse went as fast as he could before . Council . How did he hold the Horse ? Osgood . With his left Hand , and cut him softly with right Hand . Council . Did you apprehend that he endeavour 'd to stop the Horse or force him forward ? Osgood . I thought he did not endeavour to stop , but rather to push him forward . Prisoner to Robert South . Was not I thrown off the Horse when the Deceas 'd was beat down ? South . Yes , the Horse 's foot hitch 'd in her Petticoats , and so he fell on his Knees and you fell over his Head , and then you got up and desir 'd me to assist you in helping the Deceas 'd up . John Snow . I keep the King's-Arms . I stood under my Gateway when the Prisoner rid up the Town : He whipt his Horse 2 or 3 times , and said to Osgood , That Fellow ought to be knocked off his Horse to prevent his doing Mischief . I did not see him ride against the Deceased , for I was about 150 Yards off . John Lovejoy . My Shop 's about half way between the Kings-Arms and the Place where the Accident happen 'd . The Prisoner whipt his Horse as he rode by my Door , and a Butcher said to him , You Blood of a Bitch ! What do you ride so hard for ? You 'll do some Mischief . John Cook the Butcher . You Son of a Bitch you , says I , What do you ride so fast along the street for ? You 'll ride over Somebody by and by . The Prisoner made some answer , but I did not hear what it was , and his Horse run rather faster than before . Indeed I did not see him whip or spur the Horse , but he bore upon his Stirrups and lean 'd forward ; and I did not observe that he endeavour 'd to pull the Horse in . John Beacham . I was going out of my Father 's Yard with a piece of Timber , and was about 10 Yards from the Accident . My Face was towards the Prisoner as he rid by our Gate , and just after he past me , my Partner , Robin South , said , Damn you come out ; the Man has rid over the Woman . I look 'd , and the Prisoner was beat down , and the Prisoner 's left Foot hung in the Stirrup , and part of his Body was on the Ground ; but getting up , he raised the Deceas 'd , but she fell again in his Lap , For God sake Brother , says he , lend me a Hand to help her up , and so I did . Before the Prisoner came to our Gate I heard Somebody call out , Get out of the way , but am not sure it was he that spoke . Court . Did the Horse stand still after he was disentangled ? Beacham . No ; he run down Sow gilders-Lane . - Wilkins . After the Accident , the Prisoner was carried to the King's-Arms . He was looking out of the Window as I was going by , and I said to him , It 's a sad Misfortune that you have been guilty of , and it 's strange that you could not stop your Horse . He answer 'd , I bid her get out of the way - But if it cost me 50 or 60 l. I sha n't value that . William Hassam . I was in the Room where the Prisoner was detain 'd 2 or 3 Hours . He struck his whip upon the Table , and said , God Damn it , here I am detain 'd for killing one old Woman , and I might have kill 'd half a dozen in London - and then he turn 'd about and look 'd out of the Window . William Ward . I heard him say , God Damn it , I am contain 'd here for nothing . What signifies killing an old Woman or two ? If I had been in London I might have killed 5 or 6 in the time . Robert Price , Surgeon . The Deceas 'd past by my Door , and spoke to me a little before the Accident . In half an Hour I was sent for , and found her in the Road Speechless , and to all appearance Dead . She had a large contused Wound in her Head , a little above the Temporal Muscle , and her Skull was laid bare . She had likewise another contused Wound on her Nose . She died on the 8th of August , about 11 at Night . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . I was coming from Petersham to London ; I paid the Turnpike at Putney-gate , and as I was going over the Bridge , about the middle of it , a Knife Grinder set down his Barrow , at which the Horse started , and had like to have thrown me over the Rails into the Thames ; and then he ran forward with such force , that the Fulham Turnpike keeper perceiving it , he threw open the Gate for fear I should fall upon the Spikes . My Horse got the Bitt out of his Mouth , so that I could not manage him . I call 'd to the Woman to get out of the way ; and told her I could not stop the Horse . And if I gave him a Cut or two it was to prevent his running against a Post . William Hart . I am a Servant to Mr. Toriana . I was with the Prisoner when he paid the Turnpike at Putney , and going over the Bridge , a Knife-grinder coming from Fulham , set down his Barrow , at which the Prisoner 's Horse took such a Fright , that I thought he would have leap 'd over the Rails . The Turnpike Man at Fulham threw open the Gate , and let him through ; and he ran as fast as he could go , till I lost sight of him . Ann Throp . I heard the Prisoner call to the Deceas 'd to get out of the way , and presently the Horse jump 'd out of the Track , and the Prisoner fell over his Head . Martha Butler . I stood up for fear of the Horse . The Prisoner call 'd 3 or 4 times to the Deceas 'd to get out of the way , and he held his Horse as much as he could ; but the Horse ran against the Deceas 'd , and threw her down in Sow-gelders-lane . Court . Sow-gelders-lane ? I apprehend ( by what the other Witnesses swore ) that it was in Bear-street ? Butler . Sow-gelders-lane turns out of Bear-street - The Corner goes by a sort of around , and it was a little way down this Lane that she was kill 'd - It is not much farther than to yonders Spikes - So that the Prisoner could not see the Deceas 'd before he came to this turning . Robin South , again . Yes , it was in Sowgelders-lane about 25 Yards down from the Corner of Bear-street . Elizabeth Piggot . My Master 's Door is at the End of Bear-street at the Corner of the turning , and the Prisoner coming to the Corner , cry 'd , Hollo ! Get out of the way , I ca n't stop my Horse . Cornelius Matthews . I stood at the End of Sow-gelders-lane . I heard the Prisoner cry out before I saw him , and I did not see him till he turn 'd the Corner , and then he lean 'd back with his Hands to the Reins , and in a Minute 's time the Horse was down , and the Rider too . William Warren . I was just by where the Accident happen 'd . The Prisoner cry 'd Hallo ! Have a care , I ca n't stop my Horse . The Deceas 'd led a Child in her Hand , but the Child got loose . Mr. Wailwright . The Day after the Misfortune the Prisoner came to me , and exprest a great deal of concern , and desired me to Visit the Deceas 'd , which I did - I never saw him disguis 'd in Liquor , I believe he is as sober a Man as any in the World ; and I do n't think he would hurt a Worm . The Prisoner 's Master . The Prisoner was a very sober Man - I know the Horse was apt to start ; and when he did , there was Nobody could stop ; him for the more he was pull 'd back the worse he would be , and the Prisoner was not used to ride him . Mr. Horn . I knew it was a run-away Horse - I have known the Prisoner a great many Years ; a very sober , civil , and obliging Servant ; and if he was out of Place to Morrow , I would take him before any other . Mr. Ingram . The Prisoner was Servant to my Nieces upwards of 13 Years , and always behav 'd himself very sedately I never saw him inclin 'd to be Mischievous , ill-natur 'd , and do n't think him capable of so rash an Action , as wilfully riding full speed through a Town - He has appear 'd very much dejected since the Misfortune . The Jury acquitted him , and found that Ann Cross received her Death Accidentally . 6. Thomas Slade , was indicted for Ravishing , Carnally knowing , and wickedly abusing Margaret Thomson , an Infant , between 6 and 7 Years of Age , August 18 . The Council for the King open 'd , that the Prisoner was a Porter at Lion's-Inn , that he had been seen to take indecent liberties with the Child : And her Parents being inform 'd of it , they whipt her , and charged her never to go near him again : But that not long afterwards , they found the Child so much out of order , that she was forced to be put under the care of a Surgeon . Mr. Coland , and Mr. Serafton , two Surgeons , Deposed , that they examin 'd the Child , and found a small Inflamation in her Parts , but did not think is was the Venereal Disorder , nor was there any Laceration , and without that there could not be a Penetration . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 7 Judith Cupid , alias Euper , was indicted for stealing a Silk-gown and Petticoat value 4 l. 4 s. and other things the Goods of Susan Snell , and 5 Silver-spoons , Linen and other Things , the Goods of Christopher Gibson ; in the House of Thomas Cobb , August 29 . The Prisoner was Servant to Mr. Gibson , who had Lodgings in Mr. Cobb 's House at Stoke-Newington . She went away with the Goods , but was soon after taken , part of the Goods upon her , and the greater part were by her Directions found in the House of Alexander Walker , to whom she had Pawn 'd them . The Jury found her Guilty to the Value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 8. John Brown , was indicted for stealing 2 Earthen-mugs tipt with Silver , the Goods of Benjamin Winckles , August 8 . Guilty [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9 , 10. Thomas Edesbury , alias Edsfworth , and Sarah Griffith , alias Griffin , were indicted for stealing a Silver-Cup , value 40 s. the Property of Matth.ew Bird , July 23 Mr. Bird . I kept the Ship-Tavern at Temple-Bar and was burnt out by the Fire that happen 'd there , on the 23d of July , about 2 in the Morning - And afterwards a Man came , and enquir 'd , if I had not lost a Silver Cup , and a Brass-candlestick - I knew the Cup was mine by the Mark , but was not so positive to the Candlestick , and therefore did not put it in the Indictment . James Jemmit . I keep a Brandy-shop at the End of Gloucester-Court in White-Cross-street . On the 23d of July between 6 and 7 in the Morning , the Prisoner came to my Shop for a Dram . The Woman had something ty 'd up in a Handkerchief , and desir 'd me to let her leave it a little while in my Shop , and let Nobody but her have it . So she put it upon the head of a Cask , and they both went away together ; the Man came again by himself , in half an Hour , and wanted the Bundle . No , says I , the Woman bid me deliver it to Nobody but herself . Well , says he , then take care of it and do n't let her have it except I come with her , for there is something of Value in it . Something of Value ? Says I , Then it can never belong to her , for she thinks herself rich when she 's worth a Bushel of Cinders - You must know she 's a Cinder-Wench - It 's no matter for that , says he , there is a Salver Taster in it . So I opens the Handkerchief , and there was a Parcel of Rabbit-skins , a Brass-candlestick , and this Silver-cup . Is this your Taster ? Says I , 't is a good sizeable one ! By and by in comes the Woman , and I charges a Constable with them . And upon enquiring I found out the Prosecutor ; I had never seen Edesbury before , but the Woman had been several times at my Shop . Sarah Griffin . I had been at Covent-Garden Market , and as I came back I found this man ( Edesbury ) standing at the Fire . He had got the Cup and Candlestick under his Coat , and he ask 'd me if I knew any House where I could leave them for him . Thomas Edesbury . Are not you a lying Toad ? Did you ever see me in your Life before - My Lord she 's wicked vile Woman , never set Eyes on her in my Days . Court . It seems you were taken up together . Edesbury . That 's true to be sure ; but I never had the least acquaintance with her till that Morning when I happen 'd to see her at the Fire - I was drinking at the Woolpack in Petticoat-Inn till 12 at Night , with others of the Craft - The gentle Craft , my Lord ; and there was a Prize-shoe to be shewn , and after that I went to see one of my Shop-mates home to St. Martin 's lane ; and in coming back I saw this Woman at the Fire with these Things in her Apron . You Bitch you , says I , what have you got in your Lap ? She said it was something she had found , and then she ask 'd where Tom Gilpin was - Court . Tom Gilpin ? You said you had never seen her before , how came she then to know that you were acquainted with Tom Gilpin ? Edesbury . That 's well observed indeed , my Lord - I believe I over-run my self a little there - I have but a bad memory , for I forgot the main Article - Yes , I had seen her before , for I and my Shop-mate and Tom Gilpin , coming from Petticoat-lane , met this Creature in Cheapside and pick 'd her up ; Tom asked her to go to Drury-lane , and she agreed to it : But there she dropt me , and my Shop-mate went along with Tom ; and so I and my Shop mate went to St. Martin's-lane together ; and as I came back I met this Bitch at the Fire , and ask 'd her what she had got in her Apron , and so she came to ask me where Tom Gilpin was ; You Bitch , says I , You have must reason to know where he is , for you were with him last . And then she and I went through Temple Bar into Fleet-street , and turn 'd down Chancery-lane , and so came to Fetter lane , and then to Shoe-lane , and down Harp-Alley to Fleet-ditch , and up Fleet-lane to the Old-Baily , and cross Newgate-street to Giltspur-street , and through Pye-Corner into Smithfield , and so to Long-lane , and cross Aldersgate-street to Barbican , and then down Red-Cross-street , and up White-Cross-street to Jemmit 's Brandy-shop ; and there we drank together , and she left the Things and then we parted . Court . But you thought fit to call there and demand the Bundle , as if you had aright to it ; and it seems you knew there was something of value in it . Jemmit again . When the Constable came , Edesbury said , for Christ 's sake be favourable , or I shall be hang 'd for these Things ; and he own 'd they were taken at the Fire . Edesbury . I said I believ 'd she had stole them there - And has for her part she got drunk , and gave Jemmit a slap of the Chops as she was going into Newgate . William Drogheda and Job Williams depos 'd , that Edesbury had Lodg 'd with then , and they took him to be a very honest Fellow . The Jury found both the Prisoners Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 11. John Green , was indicted for assaulting Mary Cowley in an open Field near the High Way , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Leghorn Hat , a Cap , and a Top Knot , a muslin Apron , and 2 Handkerchiefs , August 2 . He was a second time indicted for assaulting Elizabeth the Wife of John Cowley , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Leg-horn Hat , a Muslin-hood , a Cap , an Apron , 2 Handkerchiefs , and 18 d. at the same Time and Place . He was a third time indicted for assaulting Susan the Wife of Walter With , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Leghorn Hat , a Cap , 2 Handkerchiefs , an Apron , a Callimanco gown , a Silver Thimble , and 3 s. at the same Time and Place . He was a fourth time indicted for assaulting John West , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a pair of mixt Metal-buckles , and 3 s. 6 d. at the same Time and Place . At the Prisoner 's Prayer the Witnesses against him were examined a-part . John West . I think it was on Saturday , the 2d of August , between 9 and 10 , but nearer 10 than 9 at Night , as I and Mary Cowley , Elizabeth Cowley , and Susannah With were going over the Fields , between West-End and Kilburn : I being foremost , the Prisoner came up to me with a Pistol in his Hand , and bid me deliver my Money . Then he took 3 s. 6 d. from me , and went to the three Women , and he robb 'd them of their Hats , and Caps , and Aprons , and one Gown ; and while he was doing that , he threatned to shoot me if I offer 'd to stir . Then he came to me again , and took my Buckles out of my Shoes ; I suppose he thought my Buckles were Silver , for they look 'd white , but they were mixed Metal . I could see his Face plainly , for it was almost as light as Day , and I had some Knowledge of him , for I had seen him before ; tho ' I believe he did not know me - He worked labouring Work at Paddington , and I took him next Day a Mowing at Mr. Whitaker 's . Court . Are you sure it was Saturday Night ? West . I am not certain as to that ; but it was the same Day as Hampstead-Fair was on , for we had all been at the Fair that Day , and were going home to Kilburn - I believe it was not Saturday , because we took him at work next Morning . Elizabeth Cowley . On Friday , the 2d of of August , as we were returning from Hampstead-Fair , in the Field , near the Road , betwixt West-End and Kilburn , a Man , in a white Frock and metal Buttons past by us , and said , Good Night , Gentlewomen ; Good Night , Neighbour . When he was gone , we said to John West , Do you know him ? And he answered , Yes ; he lives at Paddington . When we came to the End of the Field , the same Man started out upon West , from behind a Hedge , and said , Damn your Blood ! your Money ! He took 3 s. 6 d. from West , then he robb 'd me , and my Daughter , and Mrs. With . He took my Hat and Cap , a muslin Hood , an Apron , two Handkerchiefs , and 18 d. and after that he went again to West , and made him pull out his Buckles . It was then between 9 and 10 , but nearer 10 than 9 I think the Prisoner is the Man , for I took pretty good notice of him ; he had a light Wig on , and he was new shaved . He was taken next Morning , and I believe he had on the same white Frock that he has now , and had when he robb 'd us . Mary Cowley . My Mother and I , and two Neighbours , John West , and Susan With , had been at the Fair , and were going home to Kilburn . We had had more Company , but they parted from us at a Cross-path . A Man came by us , and said , Good Night , Ladies ; Good Night , Neighbour . As soon as he was gone , some of us said to West , Who is that , John ? and he said , I believe I know him ; but I ca n't call to mind his Name . When we came to the End of the Field , which was within two Fields of our own home ; the same Man bolted out from a Bush ; Lord bless me ! says my Mother . The Man came up to John , and said , Damn your Blood , your Money . Then he robb 'd John , and afterwards robb 'd us . He took from me a Leghorn Hat , a Cap and Topknot , a muslin Apron , and two Handkerchiefs . It was between 9 and 10 at Night , but nearer 10 than 9 . He was in a white fustian Frock , with metal Buttons , and a white Wig ; and to the best of my Knowledge the Prisoner is the same Man . We found him the next Morning a Mowing at Paddington , and he had then on a white Frock and metal Buttons ; but I am not sure it is the same , for I thought it look 'd cleaner . Susan With . On the 2d of August , between 9 and 10 at Night , but nearer 10 than 9 , as we were going over the Fields , betwixt Kilburn and West-End , a Man in a white fustian Frock with metal Buttons overtook us , and said , Good Night , Neighbours ; and so he went forward , and I said to West , Do you know him , John ? Yes ; says he , but I ca n't remember his Name . He robb 'd John first , clapping a Pistol to his Breast , and then me , and the other two Women . He took from me a Hat , a Cap , two Handkerchiefs , an Apron , a Callimanco-Gown , and 3 s. 6 d. and afterwards he went to John again , and made him pull out his Buckles . When he got what he could , he bid us go on , and said he would leave our Clothes in the Field . Next Day , when the Prisoner was taken , he had on , as I believe , the same Frock , and I believe he is the same Man that robb 'd us . William Sands . I live at Paddington ; I went out on Saturday Morning to take a Walk as usual , and coming home , the Landlord of the Green-man said to me , Lord , Sir ! there is a Man at our House charged with a Robbery , and we have no Warrant nor Constable to take him up . Phoo , says I , any one may take a Felon without a Warrant . So I went in and said to these Witnesses , 'T is a sad thing to swear away a Man 's Life ; and therefore I 'd have you be very cautious - Are you sure that this is the Man ? And they all said they were positive . The Prisoner 's Defence . Joseph Deverel , a Headborough of St. Giles 's Parish . On the 2d of August , about Noon , I went to see the Men stand in the Pillory , in Broad-street by Carnaby-Market , after which I staid with some Friends in Carnaby-street , till between 8 and 9 ; and then I went by the Prisoner 's House , in Bell-Lane , in Mary-bone Parish , and he was at the Door ; it was then within a few Minutes of 9 a Clock , and his House is two Miles from Kilburn . He 's a labouring Man , and his Character has been pretty good latterly , but about a Year ago he was Servant to one Smith , a Horse-Courser , who run away . Court . On what Occasion ? Deverel . To bilk every Body . Mr. Sands again . Was not that Smith accused of Horse stealing ? Deverel . I have heard such things - I think it was in the News . Mr. Sands . You were at the Green-Man when the Prisoner was taken ? Deverel . Yes ; I was . Court . And did you take any notice there , that you had seen the Prisoner at home at 9 a Clock ? Deverel . No . Court . How so ? Deverel . The Women could not agree about the time , they were in different Stories ; some said they were robb 'd about 9 , and some before 9 ; besides I did not stay there two Minutes , because I was going to make my Dough , for I am a Baker . Court . And yet you staid long enough to hear them tell different Stories . James Steward .

He brought a Letter , in which he said he had received a Bill of Exchange on Mr. Vassalli , and desired me to inform him where Mr. Vassalli lived , that he might direct to him . I told him I would enquire . He came again on Monday , and I went with him to Mr. Welford , who gave him Directions . He came a third time on Wednesday Morning , and desired me to let him write a Letter in my Room . I told him he might have been furnish 'd with Pens , and Ink , and Paper at his own Lodgings , which was in Cecil-Court , near St. Martin's-Lane ; but if he chose to write in my Room he might . And so he sat down at my Desk and began his Letter . My Desk was open , for I had just been writing there my self ; and I had left 17 Guineas , 3 Crown pieces , and some Shillings in one of the Drawers . Before he had done , he desired me to help him to a Glass of Water . I went down and brought a Glass : and he was still writing . When he had finish 'd his Letter , he directed it to Mr. Vassalli , and then I shut my Desk , and we both went to Dinner to Mr. Angelis , where we staid till evening ; and then went again to my Lodgings , where I found Mr. Costa waiting for me . We all 3 went up into my Room , I open 'd my Drawer , and mist my Money . Mr. Costa perceiving some alteration in my countenance , asked me what was the matter , I said I have lost 15 Guineas and 10 s. But I know and can swear who has it - For while my Desk was open , there was Nobody left in the Room but the Prisoner - I added , I 'll take the Law , and have satisfaction . The Prisoner turned pale . I went down to ask Mr. Bowden 's Advice what I had best to do . The Prisoner and Mr. Costa quickly follow 'd me . I asked the Prisoner to stay , but he would not ; and so we all went to the Prisoner 's Lodgings . And while I was knocking at the Door , he ran down St. Martin's-Lane , and by the Church , I follow 'd , and cry 'd Stop Thief ! And as he was running , he put his Hand in his Pocket and threw the Money upon the Pavement , for I saw the motion of his Hand , and heard the Money fall . He was stopt soon after , though he made great resistance in the mean time . The mob picked up the Money , and a Sharper coming by and claiming it , they gave it to him . When the Prisoner was carried before the Justice , he said I lent him the Money , and being ask 'd why he ran away , He answer 'd that I assaulted him with a Knife . Prisoner . I did not ask for Water till after I had done my Letter , and you lock 'd the Desk , and took the Key before you went down . Mr. Tadie . No , I left it open . Court to the Prisoner . Why did you run from your own Door , and throw the Money away ? Prisoner . After the Prosecutor had complain 'd of his Loss , I said to Mr. Costa Let us go , or we shall be imputed . And when I came to my own Door , I was assaulted in the dark by 3 Men , who demanded my Money ; and therefore I run . Court . But why did you throw the Money away ? Prisoner . I took it out of my Pocket in order to save it , but in the Fray it dropt out of my Hand . Mr. Costa .

While we were talking , Mr. Tadie and the Prisoner came , and we all 3 went up into Mr. Tadie 's Room . He open 'd his Desk and pull 'd out his Drawers ; upon which he look 'd very uneasy , and gave himself a knock of the Pate , - What have you lost any Money ? says I , Yes , by God , says he , but I know by God who has got it , and I 'll see the end o n't . But he did not name any body then , though he told me the next Day . Court . Did not Tadie say , that Nobody was left in the Room but the Prisoner while the Desk was open ? Tadie . No , I told de Costa that I knew who had it , but I did not name the Person at that time . Mr. Costa . While Mr. Tadie went down to Mr . Burden , the Prisoner turn 'd his back to me , fumbled in his Pocket , to shift his Money as I thought , and he dropt a Guinea , or some such piece of Gold ; I stoop 'd to reach it , but he took it up himself - When we came to the Prisoner 's Door , Mr. Tadie knock 'd , and then the Prisoner ran away , and Mr. Tadie after him ; but I staid at the Door - The Prisoner was a stranger , and had been but 2 or 3 Days in England . John Martino . I am Servant to Mr. Herbert , the Queen 's Jeweller in St. Martin's-Lane . I heard a cry of stop Thief , and ran to the Door with a Candle , and found some Money lying on the steps : What 's the matter ? Says I , a Gentleman has been robb 'd , says one , What Gentleman ? Says I . This Gentleman , says another , and pointed to a stranger who was very well drest in a light Suit and Ruffles . So I pick 'd up some Gold , and gave it to that stranger , and others did the like . I was going to take up a Guinea and a half more , but my Mistress came and bid me not touch anymore ; and so I kick 'd it towards the stranger , and bid him take it up himself . Then I went in ; but hearing a fresh Noise , I stept to the Door again , and Mr. Tadie had got hold of the Prisoner . What , says I , was it you that was robb 'd ? Yes , Why here has been a Stranger that has taken all the Money - The Prisoner struck those about him with his Cane , and in the scuffle the Cane was lost . Francis Roboullet . I saw the Prisoner in the Round-house . He swore that he would Murder Tadie , or some of his Relations , either here or in Italy , or at least he would burn his House - When he came to the Justice , he said he came over hither to change his Religion , and they wanted to murder him , or swear a Robbery against him : That he knew nothing of the Money that was thrown upon the Pavement , but believ 'd they might throw it after to raise a Suspicion - The Justice and he discoursed in Latin , but they did not rightly understand one another , for we do n't pronounce it in the same manner as the English do . James Bowden . I heard the Prisoner say , that he came over to change his Religion ; but that Mr. Tadie dissuaded him from so doing , and the better to prevail with him , lent him the Money . Prisoner . Yes , he lent me 16 Guineas on Monday Night ; and Mr. Angelis knows I had Money next Day . Angelo de Angelis .

The Prisoner came riding along by Barnet Market , he had no Shoes , and the Horse had no Saddle , but only a Brible , which made me suspect the Horse was stolen ; and therefore I ran after him , the Prisoner began to gallop : I call 'd out , Stop him !

But then there 's the Ring , says I ; Aye , says he , but he gave me that - There has been a great Family Quarrel between them . John Osgood . We met at Slaughter 's House to agree the Matter up . Says the Prosecutor to Slaughter , Why do you encourage an informing Rogue ( meaning the Prisoner ) in your House ? Do you intend to turn Informer too ? For the Prisoner had laid an Information before the Commissioners against the Prosecutor . - Says I to Smith , I 'd have you make the Matter up , for Knot is a very honest Man , I have known him fourteen Years . Why , says Smith , you do n't know what a Rogue he is ; I have been too favourable to him , I could have hang 'd him , if I had sworn the Door was lock 'd when he rob 'd me ; but now it can be only Transportation . I saved his Life once before , when he went to hang himself ; for his Sister found him swinging , and set up such a damn 'd Squaul of Fire and Murder , that I run up in a surprize . He began to keck , and I , like a Sot as was , cut him down , and his damn 'd Clum-foot came thump upon the Floor . - I ask 'd his Sister about this , and she said she knew nothing of it - The Prosecutor at last offered to make it up , if the Prisoner would pay half the Money that was due on the Information .

I had not gone far before I was overtaken by two Men in light Colour 'd Stockings . They past by me without speaking .

I thank 'd him , and so we went on to the End of the Field ; where the path divides in two ; one goes to a Gate , and one to the Gap . I went towards the Gate , and they the other way : But presently they turn 'd towards me - And one of them , not the Prisoner , came up and said , What Money have you got young Woman ?

I said - No - Do n't frighten me , for I am with Child , Damn your blood , says he , stand still and I wo n't hurt you - The Prisoner at the same laid his Hand upon my Shoulder , and ask 'd me why I made such a Noise , and said they would do me no Harm , if I would be quiet .

I told him it signified nothing my going , for I had got but Six-pence ; but he would have me go : And when he came to the Tavern , he said he had Money enough , and shew 'd me 4 Guineas and a half - They sat down together ; she undid his Breeches , and was very busy with him - In about 9 Minutes another Gentlewoman came to the Door , and call 'd her away . Presently after she was gone , he complain 'd he had lost his Gold , and enquir 'd of the Drawer if he knew the Woman ; but he said he knew nothing of her . Prisoner . Mr. Drinkwater the Drawer knows me well enough - I have People to my Character - I never saw the Prosecutor in my Life , before he charged we with picking his Pocket ; and I was then going down Fleet-Street to meet my Brother at the Six Bells .

James Davis . I went with the Prosecutor to the Compter , the Prisoner put out a Paper , and said to the Prosecutor , this is a List of the Goods you have Lost . And then shewing his , he added - And these are your Shoes . Thomas Hill . I heard him own the Fact , and , ( shewing his Feet ) he said these are Mr. Taylor 's Shoes . And ( pointing to another Prisoner ) That 's one of his Wigs upon that Man 's Head - And , says he , when I broke into the House , I was afraid Mr. Taylor was coming down ; but if he had , he would never have gone up again alive - We put the Goods into Sacks , and so past the Watch in Theobald 's Row ; but they never offer 'd to Stop us . This was confirm 'd by - Wright , the Prosecutor 's Servant . Prisoner . I was in Company with Will . Wig and James Goodman , and they told me several Particulars of this Robbery , and the Prosecutor told me the rest , and I having been guilty of some trifling Things , such as picking Pockets and the like , was willing to clear my self by turning Evidence . Mr. Taylor , again .

William Ward . I live in William Newman 's House , where the Prisoner had work 'd a Week ; I miss 'd the Money in my Chest on Friday Afternoon . I suspected the Prisoner , and charg 'd him with taking it . He at first deny 'd , but afterwards confess 'd it ; and pull 'd part of it out of his Pocket . He said he had laid out the rest , which was 4 l. in buying a Horse , and some Clothes at Watford ; tho ' it was then but 7 Hours since he stole it . I found 7 l. 13 s. upon him , and I got the Money again for the Horse , but 36 s. was quite lost . William Newman .

He laid down his old Hat and took up the new one , and said , Exchange is no Robbery - I did not follow him , because I thought it was a Joke . William Rigsworth .

But I had been drinking Two-penny , and being in Liquor I laid down to sleep in the Stone cutter 's Yard in Shoreditch , next Door to the Gin-shop , and somebody came and stole the Hat away , and this is two Years ago . Court , to the Prosecutor . Why did you not prosecute sooner ? Jackson . I found him at a Brandy-shop 3 Hours after the Exchange , as he call 'd it , and ask 'd him where my Hat was ?

Elizabeth Cook , and Mary Bartlet , were indicted for stealing a silver Watch , value 30 s. 2 half Guineas , and 30 s. the Goods and Money of Edward Mason , in the House of Thomas Gale , Aug. 5 . Edward Mason . On the 5th of August , between 2 and 3 in the Morning , I happen 'd to be in Liquor , and as I was going along Fleet-street , I was pick 'd up by what we may call - not a Woman , I suppose - but - a Mistress of the Town , and I was taken into Sword and Hanging-Alley , or Hanging and Sword Alley , or some such a cramp sort of a Place . Court . What happen 'd after you were carry 'd into this Alley ? Mason . Carry 'd ? - No , have a care of that , I was not so drunk as that came to neither - I was not carried - I walk 'd or as a Body may say , I was conducted , by this Woman , as I took her to be ; but I ca n't be positive what she was , Because I did not examine her , and I would not swear to a Thing that I was not sure of . Court . Was it either of the Prisoners ? Mason . No ; no , it was none of the Prisoners - But I was conducted up into a Room where I found the Prisoners . We had 2 or 3 Quarterns of Cherry-brandy , and other Liquors to the Quantity of 2 or 3 Shillings . Then they persuaded me to go to Bed , because they saw me in Liquor ; and so I began to strip , and in the first Place the Shoes - Aye , I suppose the Shoes must come off first ; and then to be sure the Breeches must come next , and the Breeches I laid upon the Table , and then - Court . You went to Bed ? Mason . No ; I do n't suppose I went to Bed - But I was making Preparations to go to Bed , and so far is right . And when I had laid my Breeches upon the Table , the Prisoner , Betty Cook , snatches them up , and runs down Stairs with them . I cry 'd out , Stop Thief ! my Breeches ! my Breeches ! she has got my Breeches , and all that I have - And indeed it was all that I had at that time . Court . All that you had ? Mason . That is , all that I had in my Breeches , when my Breeches were off - Take me right - I do n't say t'other and all - No , no - that was all safe . Court . What did you lose ? Mason . My Watch , and two half Guineas , and 30 s. may I believe I could swear to a Guinea more , for I had 4 or 5 l. not long before I met the Woman , and I had been in no other Company that Night . Court . Where did you get fuddled ? Mason . At the Tavern along with some Friends . Court . Then you were in Company ? Mason . Yes ; in Company with Men , but with none of the other female Sex , that was what I meant , for I was not so drunk as not to know one from t'other - I left my Friends at a Tavern upon Fleet-street-hill , and at several other Places , and I had my Money and Watch then , and that was not much above half an Hour before I lost my Breeches Court . Did you follow the Prisoner Cook when she went away with your Breeches ? Mason . No ; the other Prisoner Bartlett bolted the Door , and would not let me run after my Breeches . Court . Was the Bolt within side the Room where you were ? Mason . Yes . Court . And could not you open it then ? Mason . I might have done to , but if I had where should I have found my Breeches ? Court . Did you ever get your Breeches again ? Mason . Yes ? a Man brought them to me afterwards , but there was nothing in them except this Rule . Court . When you were so drunk as you say , could you take so much notice of Cook as to know her again , and especially as you had been such a little while in her Company ? Mason . Yes ; for I 'll tell you what - It 's just like as when a Man was frighted , his Senses strike quicker than ordinary at such a Time . Court . That 's a new Piece of Philosophy . Prisoner Cook . Did I bring you into the , House ? Mason . No ; but you took my Breeche that I 'll swear , and I was not over and above drunk neither , for I remember that you were brought out of the Bed , and had no Stockings on , because as I have heard since , you were famous for slight of Hand - And I found you again , about a 11 a Clock , the same Morning , with the Watch upon you - No , that 's a Mistake , for you were upon the Watch . Francis Skelborn , Constable of St . Brides . The Prosecutor told me , that he had lost his Breeches in Gale 's House , in Hanging-Sword-Alley , upon which I took up the Landlady , and Bartlett , the Girl , and carry 'd them before Alderman Brocas , and soon afterwards I heard that Cook was at another House in the same Alley . I went and thither and found her upon a Bed . As soon as we came in , I perceived her take something off the Bed , and put it in a Chair , and then she sat down upon it . She desired us to go out a little , because she wanted to make some necessary Occasion . You Saucy Toad , says I , get up ! and then we found the Prosecutor 's Watch under her . I carry 'd her to the Bull-Head , and there she was so outrageous , that she swore , and damn 'd , and broke all the Windows , and we were forced to send for a pair of Handcuffs from the Compter , before we could manage her - At last she offered the Prosecutor 18 s. to make the Matter up . Robert Misset . I went with the Prosecutor and Constable to Cook 's Room . The Prosecutor said , That 's the Woman . She got into the Chair , and said she wanted to make Water - I swear to the Words Verbatim , and I took the Watch from the left side of her Buttock - Yes , I say , her Buttock , for I think that is a proper Word . Prisoner Cook . She that carry 'd the Prosecutor into the House , was more likely to rob him than I . Court . But how came the Watch in your Possession ? Cook . The Woman that pick 'd him up , was a little Woman big with Child , and her Husband brought the Watch to me , and desired me to Pledge it for him . The Jury acquitted Mary Bartlett , and found Elizabeth Cook , guilty to the Value of 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 57.

Mary Swan , was indicted for stealing a silver Watch , value 4 l. the Property of Richard Bushell , July 28 . Prosecutor . On Sunday Night between 9 and 10 , I met with some Company , and went to drink with them at a House in Newtoner's-Lane , where I left my Watch-case for the Reckoning , and then going out I met with the Prisoner and three more . They ask 'd me to drink , and said it should cost me nothing . So they pull 'd me into a Gin-shop ; I ask 'd what was to pay , for they promis 'd to treat me . I did not expect they would . They said there was a Crown to pay . I found I was got into ill Company , and therefore pull 'd out my Watch , in order to secure it ; but the Prisoner snatched it out of my Hand , and ran away . I follow 'd her , but could not catch her . Indeed I met with her next Day , and took her up with a Warrant , but I never got the Watch again . Prisoner . I never saw him before the Monday Morning that he took me up , and then he said he was inform 'd by some Neighbours that I had got a Watch that he had lost - But he had pawn 'd it a Month before to Bess Thompson .

Mark Halpen , was indicted for assaulting and wounding Peter Hawkins , one of the Clerks of the Exchequer , in the Execution of his Office . Mr. Hawkins . On the 30th of June was Twelvemonth , about seven in the Evening , I was going to my Seat in the Exchequer-Office , to enter some Writs . My Seat is within two of the upper End . Mr. Halpen was then sitting in Mr. Umfreville 's Seat , which is the fourth below mine . As I pass 'd by him , he said , You have serv 'd me with a Summons from the Baron , but I am not oblig 'd to take notice of it - I went to my Seat , and coming down to go to the filing Chest , near the Office Door ; He said , I am going to Tunbridge , and must have some Money . I answer 'd , I believe you 'll be mistaken - You have impos 'd upon the Court , and the Baron has been inform 'd of it . God damn you , says he , You lie ! What do you mean by that ? says I. I tell you , says he again , God damn you , you lie ! I told him it was like his Irish Manners . If I was to be born again , says he , I would chuse to be born in Ireland , for I never was asham 'd of my Country , and damn you you dare not go out of the Office . I reply 'd that I did not fear him or any Gentleman . He struck me on the Breast , and afterwards taking hold of the small End of his Whip , he struck me a violent Blow over the Eye , with the Butt End . I was confin 'd under the Surgeon 's Hands for near two Months , and it appearing that my Life was not out of Danger , the Baron committed him to Newgate - My Eye is still painful to me at times , and I find a decay in my Sight when I apply closely to reading or writing - Mr. Halpen indicted me before my Lord Hardwicke for an Assault . Council for the Defendant . Did not you strike Mr. Halpen ? Mr. Hawkins . Yes , I did after he struck me on the Breast , and then another Person interposing , Mr. Halpen reached over him , and struck me with his Whip . Barton Newman . Mr. Halpen was sitting in Mr. Umfreville 's Seat when Mr. Hawkins came in about 6 a Clock , and as he was going up to his Seat , Mr. Halpen forc 'd his Discourse to him , about a Summons taken out before the Baron , and said he had no Copy , and should not mind any thing of it - Some other Words pass 'd , and Mr. Halpen gave the Lie - And again , as Mr. Hawkins was coming down towards the Filing-Chest , Mr. Halpen said , You lie . Mr. Hawkins said , It 's not Gentleman like ; but it 's like your Irish Manners . Mr. Halpen dared him to go out of the Office , to which he answer 'd , that he was willing to meet any one . Then there was a Scuffle between them , but I ca n't tell who begun first , for I heard Blows before I saw any . I think the first Blow that I saw , was receiv 'd by Mr. Hawkins on the Breast , and Blows were repeated - The first Blow that was offered was given by Mr. Halpen ; but there was a little Scuffle before that - By a Scuffle I mean a rushing in upon one another - I can not justly charge my Memory whether the Scuffle was before that Blow or not - I am sure there was no Scuffle before . Mr. Holloway , Surgeon . On the 30th of June I was sent for to the Mitre Tavern , to dress a Wound on Mr. Hawkins 's Right-eye - The Wound was made with a bruising Instrument . It divided the small Vessel of the temporal Artery . Mr. Halpen said , that he had given Mr. Hawkins that Wound , and lash 'd him , and would lash him again . Defendant 's Council . Was not Mr. Hawkins abroad next Day ? Mr. Holloway . No ; but he went to Bloomsbury on Monday , for which I reprimanded him - I should not have given him leave to have gone abroad in less than a Week or ten Days - I believe that he 's perfectly recover 'd , I do n't apprehend that his Eye is weaker than before . For the Defendant . Mr. Rawlins . On Saturday about 6 in the Afternoon , Mr. Halpen came into the Office . I was then sitting at Mr. Oliphant 's Seat , which is three Seats from Mr. Hawkins 's - Mr. Hawkins came in , and to the best of my Remembrance , he gave the first Blow - I was near them and in a convenient Place for seeing what was done - They were both in an upright Position , walking down the Office . Mr. Hawkins went foremost , and turning short , near the Door , he took Mr. Halpen by the Arm to shove him out . This was the first that I saw , and there could not be a Blow with out my seeing ; for my Eye was stedfastly upon them all the time . Mr. Halpen was talking first with me , and Mr. Hawkins came in and interrupted him - I saw Mr. Halpen give Mr. Hawkins several Blows , but none on the Breast . Mr. Hawkins struck Mr. Halpen in the Face with his Fist , and then they closed . I saw all the Blows that were given - The Blow on the Eye was after some struggle . John Case , Constable . I was passing by and saw them both in Contempt with one another . They were engaged before I came , but heard Mr. Hawkins say , that he did strike Mr. Halpen for giving him the Lie ; and charged me with him at the same time ; and Mr. Halpen reply 'd , I struck him second with the Whip - I examin 'd them a-part , and carry 'd them to the Mitre Tavern , and there Mr. Hawkins said , he would fight him for ten Guineas , and a Sword was sent for . Mr. Hawkins . I had three Witnesses , but they are out of Town There have been 8 several Trials about this Affair - It has cost me 170 l. Mr. Halpen . By the Virtue of your Oath did not you strike me on the 9th of June ? Court . That 's out of the present Question . Mr. Halpen For his part , he 's a Lawyer , and can have Law for nothing ; but it has cost me near 200 l. The Jury found the him Guilty .
