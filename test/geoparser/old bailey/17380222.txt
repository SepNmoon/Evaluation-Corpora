James Wilson . The Prisoner was my Servant ; on the 4th of March last , she came down Stairs to me in my Shop , and told me , she was afraid I had been robb 'd , for her Mistresses 's Drawers were all open I immediately ran up Stairs , and a Gentleman who was in the Shop followed me . I found my Wife 's Cloaths taken out of the Drawers , and were laid , - some on the Chairs , and some on the Table in the Room . I missed 4 pair of silver Watch-cases , a Mother of Pearl Snuff-box with silver rims , and a Gold Watch-case was gone likewise . How can this be , says I ! Why , says the Gentleman , it must be your Servant that has done it to be sure ; I believe so too , said I , for 't was very dirty Weather , and I thought it impossible any body should come in and go up Stairs without dirting the Room . Sometime after this , a Neighbour inform 'd me , that if I would search at the Pawnbrokers , I might probably find some of my Goods : upon this , I got a search Warrant , and , Mr. Grainger 's a Pawnbroker upon Puddle-Hill , I found 2 pair of Watch-cases and the Snuff-box . I am a Watchmaker , and I apprehend these silver Cases were taken out of the Closet where I work . These are the Cases I found at Mr. Grainger 's , and I swear they are mine ; this Snuff-box is mine like wise . John Wild . On Friday Feb. 10 , I searched at Mr. Grainger 's and found these Things , and have had them in my Custody ever since . Mrs. Mason . I lodged at Mr. Wilson 's , and among other Things , I lost a Gold Watch-case . Wild . This Gold Watch Case I found with the rest at Mr. Grainger 's . Mrs. Mason . This is mine ; I lost it in Mr. Wilson 's House . I used to keep it in a leather Glove in my Scrutore , and when I went to Kingston , I intended to carry it with me , but I chang 'd my Mind , and left it behind me backed up in a Chest up Stairs in my Closet for fear of being robb 'd , and took the Key of the Chest with me . While I was at Kingston , I wanted my Watch to wear at a Ball , so I sent for my Chest , but when I came to look for my Watch it was gone . The Chest was lock 'd when it came to my Hands , but the Watch was taken away . Jane Gitson . The Prisoner is my own Sister ; she brought all these Things to me at different Times , and at different Times I carry 'd them to pawn at Mr. Grainger 's . These two silver Cases , this Snuff-box , and this Gold Case , I carry 'd to pawn for her , and gave the Money I had upon them , to her . My Mother is a Midwife , and I live with her . Mr. Grainger knew me , and I knew him , so he asked me no Questions about the Goods . Robert Wilson . This Jane Gitson brought these Things to Mr. Grainger 's House to pledge . I live with him , and took them in at different Times ; some of them have been in pawn these 3 Years . Prisoner . I own I took the Cases , and sent my Sister with them to pawn ; but she and my Mother are no ways confederate with me . As to the Snuff-box , I found it in the Pocket of a Coat which my Master order 'd me to carry to his Brother . The Gold Case I took out of a Room . I own the Fact , and hope you 'll take it into Consideration , and do my Family Justice . I own these Things , but my Mother has given my Master a Bond of 10 l. for the rest . Guilty , Death . 2. George Nevil , of St. Andrew 's Holborn , was indicted for stealing 14 hundred lb . of Lead , value 12 l. fixed to the Freehold of Robert Hind , Esq ; March 8 . He was a 2d .

Mr. Hind . I was out of Town when the Facts were committed , but I have seen the Goods I was robb 'd of , and can swear they were once in my Possession . Daniel Riggs . The Prisoner and I one Night took a quarters of a hundred of Lead from Mr. Hind 's House , the next Night we took 5 Hundred , and the next Time about 6 Hundred . We carry 'd it to one Daniel Smith in Mutton-Lane , and told him where we had it ; he bought it of us , and the Prisoner and I were equally concern 'd . At another Time , ( about the middle of the Night ) I went to Mr. Hind 's House , the Prisoner with an Iron Crow broke open the Malt Loft Door , and then an inner Door , and so got into the fore Parlour , where we broke open some Drawers , and took out 2 pair of Leather Breeches , a Velvet Cap , and some Velvet Cushions ; some Stocking Feet , and some Fringe Then we broke a fine Scrutore , and when we had taken what we thought proper , we roll 'd up all the Goods together in a Mattress and a Feather Bed , which we got out of the Hop-lost . We brought all the Goods thus bundled up into the fore Parlour ; then we broke open the Compting-house Door , where we took a Chest of Candles , and from thence we got into the Street , and carry 'd all the Things to the Prisoner 's House . This is the Truth if I was dying this Moment . John Berry . The Prisoner 's Wife was my own Sister ; she died the 13th of Oct. and not having Money to pay the Undertaken for the Funeral , he desired me to sell some of these Things , which he said were his Wife 's , but they prov 'd to be the Gentleman 's , and I informed him of them , after the Prisoner and Riggs were taken up . These are the Things which were sold to pay the Expence of his Wife 's burying . Mr. Hind These are my Goods ; I lock 'd them up with my own Hands in a Chest of Drawers . Berry . Some were sold to one in Whitecross-street , and some were pawn 'd by my Wife at the Prisoner 's Direction . This red Silk I had from him , and was to have got it dy 'd a Massareen blue , and to have made him a Waistcoat . The Velvet Cap , and one side of the Mattress I deliver 'd to Mr. Gordon for Mr. Hind . Mr. Gordon . I ca n't swear the Prisoner stole the Lead , or broke the House , but the next Morning after it was done , we missed the Goods mention 'd , and about a Month or 5 Weeks ago , this Berry came to my House , and told me he had something to say to me about my Apprentice Riggs . Riggs as soon as he saw Berry , ran from his Work to Berry 's House , to ask his Wife what Business he had with me . I got a Warrant and took up Riggs , ( my Apprentice ) and Berry . By their Means we found out the Prisoner , and took the Breeches and some of the Goods in his Lodging in Grays-Inn-Lane , one side of the Mattress was taken off his Bed , he made use of it for a Sheet . Guilty . Death . 3. Thomas Gittings , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for privately stealing a silver Watch , value 10 s. from the Person of John Hanquets , Jan. 24 . Mr. Hanquets . On the 24th of January I was at St. James 's House to see his Majesty return from the Parliament House ; after the King was come by , I attempted to get into the Park , through the narrow Passage , by the King 's Kitchen , but I was surrounded with a Croud of People , and being apprehensive of Pickpockets , I clapp 'd my Hand upon my Breeches where my Watch was Presently I felt something stirring under my Hand , and looking over my Shoulder , I saw the Prisoner very near me ; at that Instant I felt something slip out from the Side of my Pocket , and the Prisoner turn 'd about , and made off as fast as he could . I cry 'd out stop Thief ! And some Men who were near , pursu 'd him ; I follow 'd as fast as I could , but he fled into a Barber 's Entry , where these two Men took him , with my Watch upon him . I came up while they were searching him in the Entry , and he deny 'd he had any Watch about him , but I saw them draw it out between the Cloth and the Lining , from the Bottom of his Coat . This is the very Watch , which I lost at that Time , and which I saw taken out of the Skirts of his Coat . He was carry 'd before a Justice , and there he said , he found it upon the Ground . I am very positive to the Prisoner . Prisoner . Ask him if he did say before the Justice , that he could not tell who took the Watch from him ? Hanquets . No , I said no such Thing . William Capps . On the 24th of January I saw the Prisoner and Prosecutor in the midst of a Croud , and observ 'd both of them scuffling to get out of it . The Prisoner made his Way through first ; the Prosecutor follow 'd , and cry 'd stop Thief ! I pursu 'd him into the Priory , and he was never out of my Sight ; when I took him , he told me he had no Watch about him ; but the Prosecutor being positive to him , I felt in his Pockets , on that Side next me , and found nothing ; but another Person gathered up his Cloaths on the other Side , and feeling something , he cry 'd out , - here 's the Watch , and pull 'd it out of the Skirts of his Coat , from between the Lining and the Outside . The Pocket was broke , and it had slipp 'd down between the Cloth and the Lining . William James confirm 'd the above Witness , and declar 'd that he drew the Watch from the Bottom of the Prisoner 's Coat , and that Mr. Hanquets own 'd it immediately . James Wallington . I carry 'd the Prisoner before Mr. De Veil , who ordered the Watch into my Custody , and I have kept it ever since . Prisoner . I was coming through St. James 's Court that Day , and kick 'd the Watch before me the Ground ; when I took it up , it was dirty . Mr. Wallington . The Soldier ( Jones ) told me Yesterday , that he saw some Dirt upon the Watch , when he took it . Mr. Capps . The Prisoner 's Friends were all Yesterday , treating with the Soldier about a favourable Evidence from him , and they promis 'd him , he should be rewarded . Jones . They did promise to reward me , if I would be favourable in my Evidence . Capps . I never lost Sight of him , 'till I took him in the Barber 's Entry . Guilty . Death . 4. Nathaniel Hilliard , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. the 6th of May , in the 7th Year of his present Majesty , in and upon Robert Millegan , feloniously , & c. did make an Assault , and with a certain Sword made of iron and steal , value 2 s. which he held in his right Hand , him the said Millegan , in and upon the Inside of the right Thigh , did strike and stab , giving him a mortal Wound of the Breadth of half an Inch , and the Depth of 9 Inches , of which mortal Wound he languish 'd from the 6th to the 9th of May in the Year aforesaid , and then dy 'd . He was a 2d Time indicted on the Statute for Stabbing . And a 3d Time on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Mary Millegan . On the 6th of May 1734 , my Husband was with the Prisoner at Mr. Langford 's a Distiller ; I saw them both go from thence , down Windmill-Street . In a little while after this , my Husband was brought Home in a Chair , stabb 'd in the Thigh . I asked him who did it ? And he told me - that Rogue Hilliard , has stabb 'd me , - he has killed me . I know the Prisoner ; I saw him in Langford 's House . He does not wear a Sword , but had hid one under his Coat , I suppose . The Wound was in the Thigh , very near the Popes Eye ; 't was given on the Monday , and on Thursday , about II o'Clock he dy 'd . Edward Langford . The Prisoner I believe is the same Person ; he came that Day to my House to give me a Note of his Hand , for Money due to me from another Person . He was some Time in the Shop , but seeing somebody in the Street , that he did not like , he desir 'd I would suffer him to go up Stairs . When we were above Stairs , he told me he saw Bailiffs in the Street , and he was bewitch 'd that he should come out without a Sword . Upon this he call 'd a Man up Stairs and sent him for his Sword , which was brought to him , and he aid - 't was a good Bit of Stuff , and if any Officer attempted to arrest him , it should go through him . After this , the Deceased , Millegan ) brought a Man to my House that he had arrested for me , but I would not let him go into the Room , where the Prisoner was , because he was in Wratyh , and had got a Sword I ask 'd the Deceas 'd if he had any Writ against the Prisoner ? He declar 'd he had none ; then I brought them together , and they were both very friendly . The Prisoner being afraid of an Arrest , the Deceased told him , he would see him safe within the Verge of the Court , and if any Officer attempted to arrest him , he would say , he was his Prisoner already , and would deliver him safe , where he should be out of Danger . Upon these Declarations of the Deceased , they both went out of the House together ; I call 'd the Deceased back , and would have had him done some other Business for me , but he swore an Oath , and told me he could not , for he was going to arrest the Prisoner . I asked him if he was not afraid of getting some Hurt ? He swore he would venture , and would arrest him , - so away they both went . Half an Hour after this , the Deceased was brought back in a Chair wounded , and the Prisoner 's Sword was with him . I went to see him , and he told me , Hilliard had stabb 'd him . Prisoner . Did not I ask the Deceased if he had any Thing against me ? He reply 'd , no really Sir , I have not ; and Mr. Langford , said , if you have , do n't expose the Gentleman , but charge him here , and I will endeavour to make Things easy . Langford . I believe I did say so . I said , I would have you both agree , and I told the Deceased , if he had any Thing against him , he must take him to his own House , and must not meddle with him in my House ; but the Deceased declared he had nothing against him . John Langford . On Monday May the 6th , 1734 , the Prisoner came to my Father 's House ; he had not been there long , before he desir 'd to go up Stairs for fear of an Arrest . When he was in the Room above Stairs , he look 'd through the Window into the Street , and said , - he was afraid of the Bailiffs , and wish 'd he had a Sword . Presently after this , he call 'd a Man up , and sent him to Downing-Street , Westminster , for a Sword , which lay upon his Buroe . The Messenger return 'd with the Sword , and the Prisoner took it from him , and bent it , and said , it was a good Bit of Stuff , and would do . Then I went down Stairs and saw no more , till the Deceased and the Prisoner went out of the House together ; my Father call 'd the Deceased back , and asked him to do some Business for him in Shore ditch ; he reply 'd , - no , damn it I ca n't , for I am going to arrest Hilliard . Catherine Harris . The Deceased was my Brother-in-Law ; he went out well in the Morning the 6th of May , 1734 , and was brought Home wounded in a Chair . I asked him , who gave him the Wound He cry 'd , I am a dead Man ; the Fellow your Sister saw in Langford 's Window , , Nat Hilliard has done it . He was lately a Corporal in the first Regiment of Foot-Guards , but was drumm 'd out of the Regiment with a Halter about his Neck , for enlisting Soldiers for the Pretender . - The Deceased told us , that he went with the Prisoner as far as the Horseshoe Alehouse and there his Follower gave him the Writ ; there it was he tapp 'd him on the Shoulder , and told him he had a Writ against him ; upon which the Prisoner open 'd his Legs , and between his own Legs he thrust him in the Thigh . This was what the Deceased told me ; I saw the Wound ; the Deceased languished from Monday to Thursday and then died . Richard Totterdell . On Wednesday May 8th , 1734 . I went to visit the Deceased ; I asked him how the Accident happened ? He told me , that he arrested the Prisoner and was going to lay hold of him ; but he jump 'd from him ; the Deceased endeavour 'd to leap in with him , to secure him , and the Prisoner open 'd his Legs , and jobb 'd the Sword into the Deceased 's Thigh as he was behind him . I did not see the Thing done , but this was the very Writ , he was then executing upon him . Isaac Itorno . About two Hours after the Accident happen 'd I went to visit the Deceased , I enquired how he came by the Wound ? He told me , that he arrested the Prisoner in the Haymarket , and he open 'd his Legs and stabb 'd him between them , in the Thigh : The Sword is in Court , and is bent ; I suppose it ran against the Bone . I told the Deceased , that I apprehended he had not long to live , and I asked him , if he was sure the Prisoner gave him the Stab ? I know ( says he ) that I shall not live , and I am sure he stabb 'd me in the Haymarket . Henry Noble . I was by the Deceased when he dy 'd , and had hold of his Hand . He declar 'd that Hilliard had jobb 'd his Sword thro ' his Thigh , a little above the Horseshoe , on the right Hand Side of the Way , in the Haymarket . . Surgeon . I was call 'd to dress the Accident happen 'd . The Orifice was Length-ways on the Inside of the Thigh , and went upwards a Way ; then the Sword pass 'd downwards , and came out downwards . Richard Griffith , Surgeon . I was call 'd late , and made no great Observation , for I perceiv 'd an approaching Mortification , on the downward Part of the Wound . A Witness prov 'd the Writ , by Vertue of which the Deceased arrested the Prisoner . A Witness . The Deceased told me , he had no Writ against the Prisoner , when they were together at Langford 's House , but as they went up the Haymarket his Follower put it into his Hand . Prisoner . Mr. Langford swears , that when we went out of his House , the Deceased told him he was going to arrest me . Langford . When he was in my House , he said , he had no Writ against the Prisoner ; but as they were going down Windmill-Street , I call 'd the Deceased back , and he then told me , he was going to arrest the Prisoner . I asked him if he was not afraid , and bid him not be so unwise , - for the Prisoner would certainly do him a Mischief , D - n him said the Deceased , - I do n't fear him . The Widow . This is the Writ , - I took it out of my Husband 's Pocket , full of Blood . A Witness . The Deceased was sworn an Officer on the 27th of July , 1733 , and continu 'd an Officer to his Death . Prisoner . On the 6th of May 1734 , I went to Langford 's House to perswade him to take my Note , in order to his discharging one Newman whom Langford had arrested . I desir 'd to go up Stairs , and while I was above , I saw a Man go by , who was an Officer in the Marshall 's Court . I was not much afraid , for I did not owe 5 l. in the World ; but I did not care to be expos 'd . Millegan came in and told me that I ow 'd Money to one Mr. Cable , and that there was a Writ out against me . I desir 'd him to go to the Officer and tell him to come the next Day , and he should have a Guinea for not exposing me . He went to the Officer and spoke to him , and when he return 'd to me , he told me , the Officer was gone over the Water and would not return in four Hours ; and in the mean Time , he would conduct me into the Verge of the Court . I took it kindly of him , and treated him with Punch and Ratafie , promising to be grateful . As we were going out of the House , Langford 's Daughter bid Millegan not trust me , for I was a dangerous Fellow ; upon which I said to Millegan , - perhaps you have got the Writ your self , if you have , do n't expose me , and Mr. Langford said , - no , as the Gentleman has been so civil to you , if you have any Thing against him , do it here . God strike me dead and d - mn 'd , said the Deceased , if I have any Thing against him ; but as we were walking past the Opera-house , 2 Men came up to him , and while I was asking him who they were , I was knock 'd down , stuck in the Back , and my left Thumb almost cut off ; then his Followers ran away . Such Treachery and Barbarity no Man was ever used with , and I saw no Writ , - there was none produced . Charles Smith . I belong to the 3d Regiment of Guards , and was coming from Exercise when this happen 'd . I saw the Deceased knock the Prisoner down , but I ca n't say with what Instrument . His Follower said , - d - md him make sure Work . When the Prisoner got up he stagger 'd , and was bloody , and was thrust among the Poles of the Chairs which stood by the Opera house . There was no Sword drawn at that Time , nor did I see the Deceased receive any Wound , or tap the Prisoner on the Shoulder . Thomas Dunn . I was passing by and saw part of the Fray , I did not stay long , but I saw the Prisoner underneath 2 or 3 Men upon the Ground , how he came down I ca n't tell ; I saw nothing of the Arrest , nor of any Wound given the Deceased . John Rayner . I was sitting at a Public House in the Hay-Market , and saw the Prisoner come down the Street , and the Deceased with 2 or 3 Men following him . When they came against the Horshoe Alehouse , the Deceased took hold of the Prisoner and flung him down , over the Chair Poles . I suspected that he ( the Prisoner ) had received the Hurt , when I saw Blood , and I told the Deceased he had kill 'd him , no , said the Deceased , the Villain has murd'red me ; I saw no Sword , nor any Wound given to him , but the Prisoner 's Head was broke , and he was ill used . I saw the Deceased lay hold of him , but I ca n't say I saw any Blow ; the Prisoner complain 'd he was wounded , but he got away from the Crowd , and the Deceased was sent Home in a Chair . Mr. Ormerod , Surgeon . I believe the Wound could not be given the Deceased in the Fall . Baxter Polding . I was riding down the Haymarket on the Shafts of my Dray , and saw a Man strike the Prisoner with something like a Stick . He fell down , and when he recover 'd , I saw his Head bloody . I saw nothing of the Arrest , or of the tapping on the Shoulder . The Widow . My Husband had no walking Stick with him , and 't was after the Prisoner had stabb 'd him , that he knock 'd him down with his Tiptaff . Charles Smith ( the former Witness ) When I saw the Sword it was not drawn , nor did I see any Wound given after the Prisoner got up . Joel Fremoult , Surgeon . I was sent for the 6th of May to the Rose in Shoreditch , to dress the Prisoner . He had a punctur 'd Wound on the right Side under the short Ribs , about 3 Inches in Depth . I know nothing of the Scuffle . He had 2 Wounds likewise upon his left Thumb , and 2 Contusions on his Head . Langford . The Truth is this , he swore his Sword was a good bit of Stuff , and before he went out , he swore if any Bailift offer 'd to arrest him it should go through him . Isaac Burges , Seth Cary , Samuel Crane , George Sutherland , John Langley , George Gaudy , and William Hamilton , appeared to the Prisoner 's Character as a civil Man , and not given to quarrelling . Silvester Freeman . I was just now without the Door of the Court , and heard Mr. Warrington perswade a Woman to come in ; but she said she would not swear for 20 l. Mr. Warrington . A Woman at the Door ask 'd me if Mr. Hilliard was upon his Trial , I said yes ; and if she knew any Thing of the Matter she might come into Court . No , said she , I wo n't swear any Thing about him , but he 's a vile Rogue , and deserves to be hang 'd . Jury . We would desire to know if the Deceased had any Power to arrest him in the Haymarket ! A Witness . The Officer had Power to arrest him there . Guilty , Death . 5 , 6. Samuel Taylor and John Berry were indicted ; Taylor for assaulting John Berry , and committing with him the horrid and detestable Crime of Buggery . And Berry for wickedly consenting with Taylor the said unnatural Crime to commit and do , Jan. 31 . Mr. Windham . For the Conveniency of the People that live in Old Round-Court in the Strand , there is a common necessary House ; which , tho ' most of the Neighbours have a Key to , yet is often left unlock 'd . On the 31st of Jan. my Servant told me , about 7 o'Clock at Night when he was shutting up Shop , that 2 Fellows had been in the Vault about three quarters of an Hour . I thought they might be Thieves , so I took a Candle , and my Servant following me , I bolted ( went hastily ) into the Place , and found Taylor sitting , not upon the open Seat , but upon the close Part of it , and Berry sitting in his Lap ; both their Breeches being down . I call 'd them Names , and left them ; but a Mob rose upon them , and would have knock 'd them on the Head , had not a Constable in the Neighbourhood seiz 'd them to carry them before a Magistrate . When they were carried away , some Gentlemen came to me , and told me , it would be a Shame such Rascals should escape , and perswaded me to go to the Justices , When I came there , ( to Mr. Justice Hilder 's ) the 2 Prisoners were each of them endeavouring to make a Confession before the other . Berry made his Confession first , and sign 'd it ; but Taylor confessed the whole Matter too . Mr. Hilder prov 'd Berry 's Confession . The Information and Confession of John Berry of St. Olave's-street , Southwark. `` Who faith , that Samuel Taylor asked him if `` he would go out with him ? Upon which this `` Informant told him he would . That he went `` with him to Joy Bridge , but a Light coming , `` they went from thence to a necessary House in `` Round-Court , where Taylor asked him to let him `` lie with him , upon which they pulled down `` their Breeches , and Taylor committed the Act `` of Sodomy with him twice , and that Mr. Windham `` the 2d Time caught them in the Fact . Mr. Windham . Taylor confessed it full as plain , or plainer than Berry ; he said ( several Times ) he was guilty of the same Crime with Berry , but would not allow that he had enticed him to it . He own 'd he had lain with Berry twice , and made use of the Word Sodomy . After Berry had made his Confession , Taylor said he had acted Sodomy with him . Their Breeches were not put up when they were before the Justice . Mr. John Fridenburgh confirm 'd the former Evidence very exactly ; and added , that as the two Prisoners were carrying to Goal , Berry own 'd they had been from one part of the Town to another , to find a convenient Place , and at last they thought of the Place where they were taken . The Prisoners in their Defence , pleaded their being in Liquor , but it appeared from the Witnesses that they were perfectly sober . Guilty , Death . 7 Richard Jackson , of St. George 's Hanover-Square , was indicted for assaulting Catherine Peterson , and putting her in Fear , & c. in a certain Field and open Place near the King 's Highway , and taking from her a silk Purse , value 6 d. a silver Thimble , value 2 s. a silk Pincushion , value 1 d. and 4 s. in Money , Feb 18 . Mrs. Peterson . I live at Chelsea . On the 18th of Feb . I was going Home from London , in the Evening about three quarters of an Hour after 7 . In the first Field I met 3 Men , I took them to be working People , so I went on to the second , and there the Prisoner came up to me , and clapp 'd this Knife to my Breast , and with Oaths demanded my Money . I saw no Pistol , therefore I thought I might defend my self against his Knife , till some body should come up . I told him I had no Money ; Why then , - d - mn you give me your Pocket , or I 'll kill you . I bid him kill me if he dar 'd , - I would not give him my Pocket . Then I will kill you , said he , and up he threw my Hoop , and thrust at me with this Knife ; - I thought he had run it into my Guts , but I happen 'd to have this Book in my Pocket , and the Knife run against that . I scream 'd out , - Help ! help ! for God 's Sake help ! but he lugg 'd me down , and tore my Pocket in this Manner ; I continu 'd crying out , till I heard some Voices call out , - what 's the Matter ? I cry 'd , - for God 's sake stop , for I am robb 'd . When he had taken what I had about me , he ran away , I follow 'd him , and 3 Men call 'd out to me , - do n't be 'frighted Madam , we have got him . They had stopp 'd him and brought him up to me ; I knew him again , for I have had a perfect Idea of him ever since , and I went with them to the Spot of Ground where he attack 'd me , and there we found my Pincushion , some of my Papers , and the Knife that he threat'ned me with . The Moon shone very bright , and I knew both the Knife and the Prisoner . Prisoner . I might perhaps meet her , but not to know her in any Particular ; I never laid Hands on her . Peterson . I do n't know what he calls laying Hands on me , but he jump 'd out of a Ditch and tore me down upon the Ground ; I lay with one Hand upon the Ground , and with the other I defended my self against his Knife . When he had robb 'd me he ran away ; I heard him run , and he was not out of my hearing when these Men took him . I saw him as plain when he committed the Fact as I do now ; I took Notice of his Face , and of his Wig , and remember him particularly . A Woman came to me Yesterday , who said she was his Wife , and begg 'd I would not prosecute him ; or if I did , she desired me to say , I might be mistaken in the Person . Edward Meredith . Three of us were coming from the Black-Lyon at Chelsea , about a quarter before 8 , and in the next Field to the King 's Head near the Park , we heard a Woman cry , - pray do n't murder me ! - for God 's Sake do n't murder me ! We cry 'd out , Help at Hand , - Help at Hand ; immediately the Prisoner came running full Speed , and I ran after him and caught him . He trembled and quak 'd , and when we asked him what the Matter was , he told me there was only a Disturbance between a Man and his Wife . We brought him back to the Gentlewoman , who was very much 'frighted ; she knew him again , and as we were carrying him before a Justice , he desir 'd me to let him go , for then he could get clear off . I did not stay to look at the Things that were found , I had enough to do to keep the Prisoner . Francis Holloway . Constable . The three Men who took the Prisoner , brought him to my House , and this Gentlewoman with them , she was very much frighted , and shew 'd me her Pocket ; I took Charge of the Prisoner , and carry 'd him before Justice Ellis . The Gentlewoman charged him with having robb 'd her in the first Field , of 4 s. and some other , Things , and produced her Pocket which he had torn down in this Manner . James Hayes . I and my two Friends had been walking that Afternoon to Chelsea . We stopp 'd at Mr. Holloway 's House , the Black Lyon at Chelsea , and we drank Part of five Pots of Beer , and set out for London , about a Quarter after Eight . After we had pass 'd the King's-Head Alehouse , we heard the Cry , for God 's sake have Mercy ; we call 'd out , Help at Hand , and immediately the Gentlewoman cry 'd out , stop Thief ; the Man ran as fast as he could , and the first Witness caught him by one Arm , and I , by the other . We asked him what was the Matter , and he told us some People were quarrelling , and he was running from them . He was very unwilling to go back with us to the Gentlewoman , but we logg 'd him along to her , and she told us he had robb 'd her and threaten 'd her Life ; that he presented a Penknife to her Breast , and told her if she would not deliver her Money , she was a dead Woman that Moment . We hearing this , and seeing the torn Pocket , the Book , the Knife , and the other Things upon the Ground , we carry 'd the Prisoner to the Constable 's House . The Prisoner when he was examined did not own the Knife . - Harvey speak to the same Effect . Defence . I solemnly declare I never was guilty ; they swear in spight against me , because I had a Law Suit with the Man of the House , where they Lodge . When they took me , I did desire them to let me go , because I am 50 l. in debt , and there 's an Execution out against me ; and I thought if I should be confin 'd for this , I should never get out of Goal again . - Watkins , a Taylor ( with whom the Prisoner had work 'd about 3 three Years ) gave him an extraordinary good Character .

Mr. Felton . I was going Home the 21st of this Instant , about eleven o'Clock at Night , and this Woman met me , and got me into her House in Bluegate Fields , - 't was her own House , and she took me in , - in the Way of Design to murder me , - she forc 'd me into her House , and robb 'd me ; I was a little in Liquor She took me into the House , - she forc 'd me , - she l'it of me in the Way , - we have Proof enough of the Affair - here 's the Constable . I met her in Ratcliff-Highway , and she did what you may say - pick 'd me up ; I was found in a House , - but here 's the Constable , - he 'll give an Account of it I believe . - Why I do tell you , - but here 's the Constable ; he can tell you more ; - I ca n't give no ( any ) farther Account . I was robb 'd , - why , I do n't know how I came into her House , but by her Instructions , and she carry 'd me into the upper Part of it , - the uppermost Room in the House , - yes , - the Garret , - I suppose it may be so call 'd - These was no Body else but the Prisoner , and she forc 'd me up , and made me stay , - about 2 Hours , - the Constable came ; - here 's the Constable , - he fetch 'd me out . He heard a Gentleman was robb 'd - he had an Information . I employ 'd my Time while I was in her House , - said I fell asleep . I have given you all the Account I can , - but here 's the Constable . I lost 10 Guineas and a half , a Silver Watch , a green Silk Purse , and a Tobacco-box ; when I was up in the Garret , - she put me in Fear , and said , if I did not deliver the aforesaid Things she would take - and dispatch me - she would cut my Throat . There was no Body there but she and I , but she had got a Knife , and threat'ned me if I made any Noise she would cut my Throat from Ear to Ear . So she took the Money out of my Breeches Pocket , and upon this she got my Money . The Constable was taking a Walk in Bluegate Fields , and heard a Gentleman was robb 'd , - so for that Reason he found me . I did cry out , - I begg 'd of her to save my Life - she was going to cut my Throat , I ca n't say but I did go to sleep , but 't was a very little Time . It was a Terror upon me , and I was really frighted for Fear . I could not tell which Way to get out of the House indeed , I was afraid of coming down for Fear of losing my Life upon the Stairs ; so I went to sleep , - a-bed - yes , I was a-bed , but I was alone , and I believe I slept a little . The Constable came and raised me , - only examine the Constable . Michael Bell , Headborough . Last Tuesday Night I went out with Watchmen to visit Bluegate Fields , - 't is a most notorious Place . In the Way thither I met a Woman , who told me , a Man well dressed was fallen into Mall Thomas 's Hands , and she believ 'd he was stripp 'd . I ask 'd her where he was ? She directed me to the House , and I found the Door open , between 12 and one o'Clock . In the lower Apartment I found no Body , but above Stairs in a Corner of the Room , there were Cloaths spread , and the Gentleman was lying upon them . I found him fast asleep , but I 'waked him , and after he had look 'd about him a little , he got up and said , he was robb 'd of his Watch and his Money . I wonder 'd at his Cloaths being left , and that she had not taken them away ; but they were there , and he drest himself , but he could not tell how he came there . When we came into the Street , People told us that Moll Thomas was at Ray 's , at the Blue Gate . I went thither and knock 'd at the Door , but they would not open the Door . At last one Coleman a Bailiff of Whitechappel Court , heard my Voice , and he let me in . I told the People of the House , I wanted Beer for my Watchmen ; no , no , says Coleman , you sha n't drink Beer , we have got Wine enough above Stairs . So I went up Stairs , and there I saw the Prisoner sitting upon a Bed in the Room , in a fine ruffled Smock . I told her she was my Prisoner , and asked her for the Gentleman 's Watch ; she told me 't was pawn 'd for a Guinea , and asked me if I had brought the Money to redeem it ? I sent for the Gentleman up Stairs , and he charg 'd me with the Prisoner . I desir 'd him to let me know how he lost his Money and Watch , but he was so surpriz 'd when I first 'wak 'd him , that he could hardly speak , but when we were at the Watch-house , he explain 'd himself . When I asked her for the Watch , at the Blue-Gate , another Woman gave it to her , and she put it into her Bosom ; but on my threa'ning her she deliver 'd it . Bartholing Brinkley . I was that Night at a Place where they sell Gin ; and I heard a Gentleman was lost in Moll Thomas 's House ; Mr. Bell knock 'd at the Door , and I open 'd the Wicket , thinking Informers were at the Door . I told them they had more need go to Thomas 's House , and take Care of a Man that had been robb 'd there , than come to trouble us . William Tumber a Watchman confirm 'd Mr. Bell 's Evidence , and was very particular in his Description of the House , and the Condition in which the Prosecutor was found . He deposed farther , that in the Account which the Prosecutor gave of the Robbery , he made use of the Word They , - They had threat'ned him , & c. Prisoner . I had been out that Night , and when I came Home , I found the Prosecutor with two Women . He bid me fetch some Beer , and I went for 5 or 6 Pots I believe . Then he asked me to let him lie there all Night ; I told him he might if he pleased , but he could not give me less than 6 d. for a good Bed . Why then , which of these Girls must I lie with , said he , I told him , Sir , if I lie with any Man besides my Husband , it shall be with you . He said he had no Money , so he left his Watch with me , I took it , and went to Mr. Ray 's at the Blue-Gate , where they found me . I told Mr. Ray , a Gentleman had desir 'd to lie at my House that Night , so I was come to trouble them for a Lodging . Prosecutor . Tho ' I might make use of the Word . They when I gave an Account of the Robbery , yet there was no Body with me but she , - and she robb 'd me . Acquitted . 38.

That as it was worded , the Receipt could not with any Propriety of Construction be apply 'd to the Word Costs ; and that the Paper appearing but a Memorandum , it was not applicable to the Case , as the Councel had open 'd it . Mr. Russel . I humbly hope these Objections may be wav 'd ; and that the Court will be pleas 'd to enter into the Merits of the Case . Councel Defendant . I beg leave to give the Gentlemen on the other Side this Hint . - That neither Mr. Gately 's Testimony , nor his Affidavits , can be admitted in Evidence . The Case between the King and Whiting , is a Case in Point ; and 't is laid down by the Lord Chief Justice Holt , that where a Person is concerned in Interest , he can not be a Witness . Councel Plaintiff . I presume Mr. Gately is an Evidence in Law ; for supposing we convict the Defendant on this statute , the Benefit of the Clergy is taken from him , and every Thing he has , will be forfeited to the Crown ; by his Conviction therefore Mr. Gately loses all Prospect of Satisfaction , - 'twill be out of the Defendant 's Power to make him any , if he is convicted . The Objection against a Man 's being a Witness , arises from his being concern 'd in Point of Witness , and from it 's being to his Advantage that he should be a Witness . But when 't is to his own disadvantage that a Man appears as a Witness , he has always been allow 'd a legal Evidence ; as a Man may give a Testimony to charge himself . Now in this Case , if by Mr. Gately 's , Evidence the Defendant should be convicted , Gately will be depriv 'd of ever having any Satisfaction . What is he doing ? Why he is prosecuting a Man , to convict him of an Offence , which Conviction takes away all Prospect of his having any Recompence . The Prisoner was acquitted , and the Court granted him a Copy of his Indictment . 44 . 45. Edward Polson , and William Richford , were indicted for stealing a Bolster of a Bed , a double Dutch Blanket , and other Goods ; a Guinea , and 16 Shillings in Money , the Goods of John Royals , Jan. 38 .

Mary Kinshillug . The Prisoner came into my House , and laid she was just come off the Water ; she call 'd for a Quartern of Brandy , complaining she was very cold . I was drinking Tea , so I invited her to drink a Dish to warm her ; I got her some Toast and Butter , and made very much of her , tho ' she was a Stranger . In our Conversation , she told me she had a Brother who was a Holland Trader , and for my Civility she would make me a Present of a quarter of a Pound of Tea . Thus we passed away an Hour or two , and then she asked me , if I had a Room in the House to spare ; for if I had her Brother ( she said ) should make use of it . I shewed her my Dining-Room above Stairs , and she order 'd a good Fire to be made in it against her Brother came . The next Day she came again , and told me she was a Seventh Daughter , and had studied the Planets , and that there was hidden Treasure in my Cellar , - ( but 't was she found , the Treasure , - and I lost it . ) When I heard there was Treasure in my Cellar , I told her I wish 'd she could find it , - if she did , she should take what she pleased out of it for herself . Why , wo n't you believe me , said she , I said I could hardly think there was any ; but she fell down on her Knees , and wish 'd bitter Wishes if it was not true ; and on Account of this Treasure , she directed me to put all the Money an valuable Things I had in the House together in a Napkin , and lay it on the Table . I did so , and wrapp 'd up 16 Tea Spoons , a large Spoon , a Gold Ring , 8 Guineas , and 10 s. in Silver . Then she took a Pound of Bay Salt and a Pewter Spoon , and wrapp 'd the Spoon and the Salt up together . I was call 'd down to a Customer , and when I went up Stairs again , all my Things were gone , and she too . I never had any of them again . I am positive the Prisoner is the Person that robb 'd me ; tho ' she is dirty now , she was clean then . I am sure she gave me so aching a Heart , that I could have remember 'd her 20 Years . I could have remember 'd she was with me 2 Days , a conjuring me out of my Senses . - Gray . The Prisoner is the Person who was there 2 Days : I was at the Door when she went out with Kirshillug 's Money and Goods , when she was out of Doors , she turn 'd back and desir 'd me to keep a good Fire in my Room , for she was coming back again with a great quantity of Tea in 5 Minutes , and she would put it in my Room , because she did not care ( she said ) to trust my Landlady Kinshillug . She was call 'd out of the Dining Room from the Prisoner , to give Change to a Customer below ; and in the mean Time she ran away . Kirshillug . There was no Soul in the Dining-Room but she and I talking about the hidden Treasure , I left her but a very little while , but when I went up Stairs again she was gone , and all my Money too . - Galloway . I saw Kingshillug carry her Spoons and Things up Stairs , and I am positive there was no one but she and the Prisoner in the Dining-Room . I saw her come running down Stairs ( after the Prisoner was gone off , ) - crying out , she had lost all her Money , & c. Hannah Christopher . Six Years ago , last May , I went with the Prisoner from Bristol to Ireland ; I would not speak a Lye in any Reference , but I saw her in Captain Ponter 's Ship last Michaelmas Day was 2 Year coming for England . She lodg 'd in the same House with me in King Street , Dublin , we work 'd together , and I was Foot to Foot with her , and never out of her Company . I live at one Mrs. Whiting 's in White Chappel Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 56. Edward Daines otherwise Lee , was indicted for stealing a Silver Spoon , value 10 s. the Goods of Charles Coker , Esq ; Jan. 28 . A Witness . On the 28th of Jan . I was waiting at Table , the Prisoner knock 'd at the Door , I went to the Door , but my Fellow Servant coming up at the same Time , he asked her for a Basket of Dust for the Paviours . There were no Paviours at Work in the Street , but however , we let him go down in the Kitchen , and I return 'd into the Parlour . Immediately afterwards , I had Occasion to go down into the Kitchen , and met him coming up the Stairs ; he ran out and slapp 'd the Door after him . He was no sooner gone , but my Fellow-Servant observing the Print of Spoon in the Sauce , which was in a Dish I had carry 'd from Table just before , she asked me if I had brought down a Spoon in that Dish ? I told her I had . Then he has certainly got it , says she I ran out into the Street , and enquired for the Prisoner , and the Men who were dressing the Lamps in the Street took him ; I swear to the Prisoner Tho . Mata . When the Prisoner knock 'd at the Door , I stepp 'd into the Area , and saw him with Sack , under his Arm , he asked for some Dust for the Paviours . I thought to let him have a little Dust , and directed him where to find it , - I went before him and bid him follow me ; as I was going to shew him the Place , I heard something hit against the Dish that stood on the Table ; to the Dust , he said it would not do for him , because there were bits of Paper in it , clean enough for him , and to went up Stairs again and would not take it . Prisoner . I am a Potter ; I know nothing of it , I never followed that Exercise .

I keep a Publick House , and the Prisoner was my Husband 's Nurse in his Illness . The Maid brought the Spoon to me , and I gave it the Prisoner to put it up , for Fear it should be lost . I asked her about half an Hour afterward , where she had put the Spoon ? She deny 'd I had given it to her , and made two Women who were in the House , be search 'd . They insisted upon her being search 'd likewise . We took hold of her Cloaths , and in shaking them , the Spoon dropp 'd from her ; she said it dropp 'd from some of us , but I am sure it drop 'd from her , and the pewter Plate was actually taken out of the Bosom , - bent in this Manner . I am positive 't is mine ; there 's my Name , and the Mark that 's upon the rest of my Pewter . I believe 't is the first Time , and that she was in Liquor .

Ann Lowry . About the Beginning of January my Husband was in Company with one Hart , a vile Fellow , at the White Swan , in Fitter-Lane ; Hart having occasion 'd him to spend 20 l. I went to the House to persuade him to come Home . This Fellow , Hart , told me , I had no Business there ; I said , - no ! - what have I no Business with my Husband ! Well ; I got a Fowl for Supper and order 'd it to be dress 'd , thinking to entice him Home . At last he did come Home ; and I told him , I hop 'd he was in a good Humour now . Aye , - come let 's go to supper , said he , and I thought all was over ; but this Hart came into the Room , and persuaded him to go out again ; I spoke to Hart , and my Husband made me get out of the Room , and would not let me come in again ; so they eat the Fowl themselves . 'T was but a little before , that I had pass 'd a Fine , before the Lord Chief Justice Willes , to raise Money that he might pay off his Debts , and I was afraid of his embezzeling what he had about him , so I got to him again , and perswaded him to come Home : He told me , he would give me some Money , and he pull 'd out 11 Guineas which I took , and 20 l. Bill likewise . I asked him for the 40 l. Bill he had about him , - Pray my Dear give them me , - you 'll then have 20 l. behind . He had at this Time , only his Gown and Waistcoat on , and wanted his other Cloaths ; I went back to fetch them , and when I returned , I found his Night Gown and Waistcoat in a young Fellows Hands , and my Husband was going to fight in the Publick Room . I knew there was a Pocket Book in the Waistcoat Pocket , with a 20 l. and a 40 l. Bill in it , and other Notes and Bonds , so I took the Things from the young Man , and put the Pocket Book into my Bosom , pinning my Gown over it . There was a Bag of Guineas in the other Pocket ; however I put the Pocket Book for safety between my Breast and my Shirt , and was going Home with it , but my Husband came after me , and stopp 'd me . I said to him , - my Dear , you are foolish , - and in Liquor , and should not shew such Things in a publick Room . Then I got out of the House , and two Men cross 'd the Way after me . Lord thinks I , - I hope these Men do n't come after me ; and presently I was knock 'd down . The Blow stunn 'd me , and I have since had an Imposthume in my Head , which , had it not broke at my Nose , would have killed me . I ca n't tell who knock 'd me down , but I think it was Lovell that took me up . Lord thinks I ! this Fellow has got my Pocket Book ! for I found a Man take it out of my Breast when I was down . I cry 'd out immediately , - my Pocket Book ! my Pocket Book ! and Lovell immediately ran away . I call 'd out as much as my Spirits would let me , - for I had receiv 'd a sad Blow on my Head , by falling upon the Stones . 'T was about eight or nine o'Clock at Night , and the Lamps were lighted , and I look 'd upon his ( Lovell 's ) Face . In the Croud there happen 'd to be an Excise-man , who told me where he lodg 'd ; so about a Week after , I went to the House , and his Landlady carry 'd me to his Wife , who told me that her Husband ( Lovell ) was gone into the Country . I carry 'd her before Mr. Justice Margets , and she at last told us , that she would help me to the Pocket Book in three or four Hours . I would not leave her , so after she had carry 'd me up and down a great Way , we went to the Horse and Groom in St. Giles 's , where I saw Lovell , and knew him again . He deny 'd having the Pocket Book , and got out into the Street ; I ran after him and held him , crying out , - a Thief ! a Thief ! he was too strong for me and got away , but this Man took him , and the Pocket Book was found upon him , by the Constable . When it was in the Constable 's Hand , he snatch 'd it from him and gave it me himself . There were all my Papers in it but the 20l . Note ; that he had got paid . I had advertised it as dropp 'd , - not stolen , for Fear I should never have it again . Prisoner Lovell . If you knew you was robb 'd of the Book , why did you go out to look for it with Lights ? Mrs. Lowry . I immediately cry 'd out , I would give any body half a Guinea , if they would help me to it again ; and some People came and told me it was found . I desir 'd Lights might be got , but when they came to the Place , there was nothing but some Pieces of Paper torn and thrown about . Benjamin Ingram . On the 17th of January I was going up Bow street , to Bloomsbury , and there I saw Lovell , and his Landlady and Mrs. Lowry , talking together . I turn 'd into Hind street , and before I got half way up the Street , I heard a Cry of Stop Thief ; I turn 'd and saw Lovell running and crying out Bailiffs ! Bailiffs ! He turn 'd up the first Turning , and ran round the Fish-Market . I walked up the Corner , and met him , and laid hold of him . Mrs. Lowry came up and said God bless you , - he has robb 'd me of 60 l. I had him into an Alehouse , where she charged a Constable with him . The Constable searched him , and in his right Hand Pocket , ( in which the Prisoner constantly held his Hand ) he felt something , and told us , he suppos 'd 't was the Pocket-Book . He was pulling it out , but the Prisoner snatched it from him , and gave it Mrs. Lowry , - Madam , said he , - there 's your Book . 'T was ty 'd up in a Piece of brown Paper ; this is the same , - I am positive to it . She open 'd it , and there was a 40 l. Note in it , N.H. 29 . Payable to William Richardson . Upon this we put the Note into the Book again , and carry 'd him to Mr. De Veil , who committed him . George Hunt . As I was at Work in my Room at Bloomsbury , I heard a Cry of Stop Thief ! I look 'd out of the Window and saw Lovell turn up Soper 's Row . I whipp 'd up a Court and came upon him . Ingram was then coming through the Posts , so I laid hold of him , on one Side , and he on the other . When we took him he kept groping with his right Hand in his Pocket , I asked him what he had in that Pocket ? Nothing ( said he ) that you shall see . I told him he should not take his Hand out of his Pocket , 'till I had got him into a House , out of the Mob . When we were in the Alehouse , Mrs. Lowry charg 'd him with having robb 'd her of 2 Bank Notes , and the Constable took the Pocket Book out of his Pocket , but he snatch 'd it from him , and deliver 'd it himself to Mrs. Lowry . The 40 l. Note was in it , but the 20 l. Note the Prisoner told her , was gone . He confess 'd before Mr. De Veil , that he had given that , to Matthews , ( the Person not taken ) to get it chang 'd away , and that Matthews had brought him mine Guineas and a Half out of it . Mr. De Viel asked him who had the rest of the 20 l. ? He said , Matthews , and the Prisoner Staines had all the Remainder . Joseph Armstrong , Constable . I took Charge of the Prisoner Lovell , and took the Book out of his Pocket , as hath been related . Upon searching him farther , I found upon him a new Peruke , and 17s . and 5d . and a pair of metal Buckles . Mr. Deveil committing him to the Gate house , I carry 'd him there , and found Dorrel confin 'd upon the same Account . Dorrel was very desirous of being examin 'd by Mr. Deveil , and the next Morning he sent for them both before him , and after Examination , Lovel was sent to Newgate , and Dorrel to the Gate house . William Dorrel . On Thursday Jan. 13. the Prisoner Staines came to me in Brewer street , and told me a Friend of his had found a 20 l. Bank Note , and if I could get it changed , it would be of Service to us both . I said , I believ 'd I could get it done ; upon which he carry 'd me to an Alehouse in Fleet street , where I saw Matthews , and the Prisoner Lovel . Staines told Matthews , that I was the Person that could get his Note chang 'd . I thought I could perswade Mr. Lewis to do it for me ; so we all went to his House , and I told him , if he would change a 20l . Bank Note I would pay him what I ow 'd him . He consented , and Matthews catch 'd up all the Money , but 4 Guineas , which Staines was to have for his Trouble , and out of these 4 Guineas I had 3 , only I paid for a Bottle of Wine , and made Staines a Present of a Crown more . The next Morning I saw the Advertisement in the Daily Advertiser , and that Payment was stopp 'd at the Bank . I advised Lewis to keep the Note for some Time , but the Sunday following he brought Capt . Lowry to an Alehouse in the Neighbourhood , and sent for me , and detained me . Ralph Lewis . Dorrel having borrow 'd 2 Guineas and 3 s. of me , he came to me 2 or 3 Days after , with 3 Men , and told me if I would change a Bank Note of 20l . he would pay me my Money . He told me 't was a very good Note , but as I ca n't read my self , I shew 'd it to a Man in the House , and he told me 't was good . I fetch 'd the Money , and Matthews took it all . The next Morning I asked Dorrel how he could serve me so villainous a Trick ? and Mrs. Lowry coming to me , I inform 'd her how to come at him . Lovel . The 7th of Jan in the Evening , Mrs. Lowry and her Husband were quarrelling at the White Swan in Fetter-Lane ; she ran away with his Gown and Waistcoat , he followed her into the Street , and about 30 Yards from the Door she fell down , he dragg 'd her thro ' the Kennel to the White Swan , and then she said , she had dropp 'd her Pocket Book and Notes . The People ran to look for it , and I among the rest , and 't was my Fortune to find it . William Hadley . On Saturday the 7th of Jan. between 8 and 9 in the Evening , I saw a Man in his Shirt run along Fetter-Lane , and several People were with him ; I ran with the rest , and saw the Gentlewoman fall down ; I saw her when she was falling , and not before . She got up again , and the Man took hold of her , and forced her back again into the White Swan . I did not follow them into the House , but in about a quarter or half an Hour , I saw People with Lights , who said they were looking for a Pocket Book with Bank Notes in it ; I believe Mrs. Lowry herself was among them . The beginning of the Week I saw an Advertisement in Lawrence 's House , ( the White Swan ) stuck upon the Dial Case , - Lost on Saturday Night over against the Black Raven in Fetter-Lane , a Pocket Book with 3 Bank Notes in it , & c. I saw Mrs. Lowry several Times that Week , and she never complain 'd of its being taken out of her Bosom , as I heard . As soon as she heard of her Notes , then she said the Book was taken from her , and not before . I am a Porter , and work for Mr. Perry the Carrier . Jury to Mrs. Lowry . Was your Husband out with you that Night in the Street ? Mrs. Lowry . After I was got up again , and the Pocket Book was taken from me , they set a Bull Dog upon me , and I cry 'd out , for God 's Sake take off the Bull Dog . Jury . We ask you whether your Husband was with you in the Street when you was down ? Mrs. Lowry . I ca n't tell , - when I was down my Husband came to take me in . Jury . Are you sure it was not your Husband that knock 'd you down ? Mrs. Lowry . That I ca n't say . I complain 'd then that my Pocket Book was taken from me , but there was so much Mob , that my Husband could not come near me . I told them I would stop Payment at the Bank on Monday , and that the Notes would do none of them any good ; I believe I said this in the Alehouse . William Monk . The Day the Prisoners were committed Mrs. Lowry told me , ( talking with her about Lovell ) - Lord bless me , I wo n't swear the Man robb 'd me for the World . God forbid I should , - my Husband might take it from my Bosom , for ought I know . I am a Taylor by Trade , and live at the 3d House in Plow-yard , Fetter-Lane . Michael Ryan , a Chairman My Partner ( Brydon ) and I carried the Gentlewoman from Brewers-street to Fetter Lane ; when we set her down , she told us 't was crossing that Kennel she lost her Pocket Book . Madam , says I , I thought you was robb 'd of it ; no , says she , I should be a very wicked Woman if I say so . I fell down and lost it out of my Bosom . At the same Time she clapp 'd her Hand to her Breast , - but I ca n't swear whether it was her right - or her left Breast . James Brydon swore the same . William Hart . I live in Church Yard-Alley in Fetter Lane . This Gentlewoman 's Husband was at any House to hide himself on Account of Debts On Saturday after Twelfth Day , his Wife and he had Words , so he asked me to go and drink with him at Lawrence 's . While we were there , the Captain quarrell 'd with a Gentleman , and got up and shewed his Wrists ; he said he was a strong Man , and double jointed ; at last he threw off his Gown and Waistcoat , and gave them to a Boy to hold ; there being a Pocket-Book and a Purse in the Waistcoat Pocket , his Wife took them from the Boy and ran into the Street , he follow 'd her , but I staid in the House . In a little while she came in again , complaining her Husband had abused her grosly , and had dragg 'd her in the Kennel , by which Means she had lost her PocketBook ; she gave a Boy 2 d. to buy a Link , and she went up and down the Street to look for it Mrs. Lowry . This is the Fellow that kept my Husband drinking Hot-pots and Gin ; and was the Occasion of all this Affliction to us both . Both Acquitted . 64.

I ca n't tell the Day of the Month , but 't was on a Thursday , - the Day before the Court would not take Bills , - last Sessions ; the Prisoner and Harris and Slowman came in and call 'd for a Bottle of Wine , and after that - another . I had shewn them into a Room even with the Bar , and they asked me to drink with them . After this I went into the Bar , and the Prisoner followed me , and began to be rude with me . I had a Wrapper on , and my 2 Pockets were on the outside : I had nothing in the right Hand Pocket but a Bunch of Keys and a Moidore , which Money I missed immediately : I was sure his Hand was in my Pocket , for I felt him , but I thought he was going to throw my Wrapper aside ; at that Instant I missed my Money , and I am positive I had it in my Pocket 3 Minutes before . He endeavour 'd to get out of the House , but I charg 'd him with the Fact , and lock 'd up the Doors till I could get an Officer . Slowman got away , but I carry 'd the Prisoner before Captain Mitford . I apprehend he was drunk , for he only gave the Justice a few wicked S ings . I charg 'd Harris as an Accessary , but he was never out of the Room . Mary Norman . I am Servant to Mrs. Room . I saw the Prisoner go into the Bar with my Mistress , he was very rude with her there , and in a Minute she turn 'd as pale as Death , and cry 'd out , - she had lost a Moidore . There was no one but the Prisoner and she in the Bar ; Slowman stood at the outside of the Bar , and asked the Prisoner what he was about ? She said nothing at all to Harris , but when we sent for the Watch to take charge of the Prisoner , Slowman got off . Harris was not out of the Room where they were drinking . - Longbottom . I live at the Globe Tavern in Drury-Lane ; I am a Servant there , and do all the Business relating to the Wine Trade . About 5 or 6 Weeks ago , Mrs. Room sent for me to assist her , telling me the Prisoner had robb 'd her . I sent for the Watch to carry him to the Round house . As we were going up Colson's-Court , he offer 'd me a Guinea to let him go , and told me , if he should be sent to Newgate several other Things would come against him . I refused to let him escape , and he then call 'd out , - Informers ! - Bailiffs ! - all the Way we went . The Prisoner is a notorious Fellow for playing a Knife , therefore she sent for me to secure him . I am no Constable . Prisoner . This Man is a Waiter at a bad House , and is a Party concern 'd with the People that live there . John Harris . I know Mrs. Room , and I was at this Time in her House , she keeps a disorderly House by Report ; I know no Body that will give her a Character , and what she has sworn is as false as God is true . The Prisoner , Slowman , and I , went in and call 'd for a Bottle of Wine ; she shew 'd us into a Parlour , and sat herself down , between Slowman and I . She sat with us a considerable Time , and drank four or five Glasses of Wine ; then she asked the Prisoner if he had any Money about him ? For she had bought a 20 l. Bank Note that Day for 17l . and she had no Money left ? He told her he could change it , but Slowman said , it was impossible she should have bought a good Bank Note of 20l . for 17 l. Words arose , and I paid for two Bottles and was going Home . Slowman and the Prisoner would have another Bottle ; I said if we must have another , we 'll take it standing . Upon this , the Prisoner and I went into the Bar ; and while we were drinking in the Bar , she went into the Room we came t of , and call 'd her Maid ; then she rash 'd into the Bar again and cry 'd out , she was robb 'd . The Prisoner asked her , who robb 'd her ? You ! you Dog , said she , and call 'd the Watch , and we were both taken into Custody . The Constable ask 'd her if she was sure the Prisoner had robb 'd her ? She equivocated , and he told her she deserv 'd to be charg 'd too . There was her Maid and her Man , and one Brock present at the same Time .
