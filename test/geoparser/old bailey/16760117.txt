Then succeeded the Tryal of a very Young Youth , who was Indicted for Stealing one quarter of a Yard of Silk-Lutestring , and a quarter of a yard of Mascarade from a Taylor , to whom he was a Probationary Apprentice : upon his Indictment he Childishly and Innocently pleaded Guilty to the Fellony : but the Court , by reason of his Youth , ordered him to be brought back to the Barr to plead to his Bill , and he pleaded not Guilty , and was quitted . After this a Youth was tryed for a burglary committed in a house at Finchley : the man said , his house was broke open , a Napkin , a Neats , and some silver spoons were taken away , but he knew not by whom ; then another Witness was called , and he said that he was in the Robbery with the Prisoner , the other denyed it ; then the Evidence said that he was in that , and in at least twenty other Robberies with him , and if that would not do his business , the rest should ; be pleasedto know that this his accuser was a very great Criminal , and said with others , to the end they should make a Candid Discovery : but the Jury acquitted the young man , being satisfied that such fellows often prove lame in their prosecution , for a reward it is supposed they spare some that are Guilty , and often lay the burthen upon those that least deserve it . There were two men drinking , and there arose a dispute between them concerning a Spanish word , one affirmed that it was not properly exprest , the other gave him provoking language for saying so , he reply 'd , Sir I know not how to bear that affront ; then said the other if you like it not follow me out ; then he seemed willing , but was prevented by the rest of the company , who laboured afterwards to compose their differences , and they seeming well reconcil 'd ; the company left them , about an hour after they fell to quarrelling again , and being out of doors he that gave the unseemly language bid the other draw or else he would run him through ; he thereupon unsheath 'd his Rapier , and in the quarrel run the challenger into the arm , the neighbours soon put a period to their fighting , and parted them . But the wound proved mortal , and the other was therefore accused for the murther , but the Juryperceiving by the evidence that he was compelled to draw to secure his life , brought in their verdict , se Defendendo . There was a man and a Woman try 'd for a Burglary , but the house being broken open in the day time , it was esteem 'd a fellony , the man was found guilty , the other acquitted being his wife . There was one try 'd for breaking open a house at High-gate , taking away a brass clock , and a Virginy-Nightingale , but though he was seen that day with the clock , yet the evidence could not swear those things were theirs therefore he was acquitted . There was one indicted for cutting a Gentlewoman s pocket , and taking from her a box and five shilings , and three groats , she being apprehended upon suspition , and search being made they found a box like hers , and the same summ was in it , but she would not swear that was her box , nor that her money , every like not being the same , therefore she was in like manner acquitted . Every Age , nay , every Sessions brings forth new Crimes , and many times more Prodigious then the former , of which I shall give you a Cursery : the first account of such as were try 'd this Sessions in the Old-Bayly , was a Murther committed by a Boy , aged thirteen years and a Month : in Christmas time he unhappily quarrel 'd with another Boy , being his Fellow-Apprentice , about their Aprons : the Prisoner cut the others Apron-strings , and the other attempting to cut his , the Prisoner took a Three-penny Knife , and stab 'd him in the Belly : then he run out , and cryed , Lord Jesus Receive my Soul , Daniel has Kill 'd me : The Young Youth was committed to the Gate-house , he living neer Westminster , and from thence brought to Newgate , and Try 'd at the Old-Bayly : he had been taught how to excuse the Fact , but his Memory was as much Corrupted as his mind , so that he made an imperfect excuse , pretending that he had the Knife in his hand , and the other came running towards him , and stumbled upon the point of his Knife , but it appeared to be otherwise to the Jury , and they brought him in , Guilty of Manslaughter . The next Fact appeared to be much more Barbarous then the former , a man living in White-chappel , was Arrested by a Marshal's-man , and as soon as the Officer told him of the Arrest , he with a bloody hand , andbarbarous mind , thrust a very strange Weapon into his Belly , that being done , with as much vigour and as little sence and grace , he thrust at another , but his nimble body escaped his malicious purpose , and an unexpected Multitude surprized him , and took him Prisoner : when the danger of his further mischief was over , they begun to parley with him , and asked why he would do so Barbarous an act ? he replyed , That if he had not Kill 'd the Bayliff , he should have gone to the Marshalsey on foot , but now he was to go to Newgate in a Coach : but though he seemed to be of a resolute mind , and of an undaunted courage , yet by a serious consideration , he pleaded eagerly to excuse the Fact , but all in vain , for he was found , Guilty of Murther . After these , another was brought to the Bar for Murther , it appeared that he was making a joynt-stool in Clarendon-house , and one that seem 'd to have some interest there , told him that he should not do it there , the other replyed , he would : then the other struck him , and his stroaks were answered with a blow with a Miller , upon his arm : the other that was Killed challenged him to fight , which he refused to do , then he went to lock him in , but the other frustrated his designs : the slun struck at him three or four times , and he then smote him on the head with his Saw , and his Hat being off , he pierc 'd his Scull , and the wound reached very neer his Brains , upon which , within less then two days he Dyed , the Provocations being considered by the Jury , he was onely found , Guilty of Manslaughter . There was like-wise an Irish-man Try 'd , for Stealing two hundred pounds from his Master , but though several Circumstances seemed to stick as close to him as the Chain to his Leg ; yet nothing could be fully proved against him , and therefore he was acquitted . There was likewise one in the Habit of a Gentlewoman , that took a Tryal for stealing a Silver Tankard , and a considerable parcel of Money from a Citizen ; the manner was thus ; she pretendly went to provide a Lodging for a person of Honour ; Stewart and another Irish Gentleman ; and when she had accomplished her Designs , the Gentlemen came , and were wellcomly entertained ; and it being Christmas time , at night they went to Cards with the Landlord , the Landlady being gone a visitings ; in a little time they wanted some Double beer , and there was none to fetch it but the Master of the house ; he therefore went to the next door and ordered the Maid to bring them in a quart or two ; afterwards they wanted some Wine , he went the same way to work to supply their wants , but not long after they desired him to fetch them some double bear himself ; he readily obeyed the commands of his noble , and as he thought profitable guests , and was no sooner gone , but they marched up stairs to seek out his treasures , & breaking open a closet they found a silver Tankard , & a considerable parcel of mony , which they took , and left him to pay for the double ale , and not long after they met with this woman , and brought her to a Tryal , whosaid that one of the Gentlemen was her Husband , and produc 'd a Certifficate to affirm it , but the Jury then brought her in guilty of the fact . There was another woman tryed for high treason ; the cause was this . She came to a shop at Ludgate-hill , and desired them to change her a shilling , they perceiving it clipt told her that she deserved to be questioned how she came by it , she thereupon run away , but they being too nimble overtook her , and suspecting her guilt , carryed her before a Magistrate , who committed her to prison , her lodging was searched , and Pots , shears , and clippings found in it , but the Iury presum 'd to think it was her Husbands handy-work rather than hers , therefore acquitted her . There was a man that came to a Watch-maker , accompanied with a foot-man , who desired to see some Watches for his Master ; after he had seen many , he made choice of two of the best , one gold , the other silver , and the Apprentice was sent with him to bring the Watch or money for them , but when he got into the Temple , he pretended to go up stairs to his master , and so gave the young man the slip , for which he was ordered to stand in the pillory . There was another arraigned for Fellony and Burglary , but would not Plead till his Wife , who was accused with him might be released ; The Court urg 'd him in vain , and told him the Press was ready : he confidently replyed , that he was as ready for the Press : but the Court having enough to do that day , did let him alone till another , and ere that time was expired , possibly he would alter his Resolution . There were 16 burned in the hand , 3 men and 3 women condemn 'd ; 2 of the women pleaded they were with Child , and therefore reprieved for a time by the Court ; 4 ordered to be transported , & 1 to the Pillory .
