George Lancaster , of St. Andrew-Holbourn , was indicted , ( with Thomas Fernley , not taken ) for stealing 16 Thirty-six Shilling Pieces , the Money of Samuel Rash , in his Mansion-house , Feb. 13 . Mr . Rash . On the 22d of February last , the Prisoner confess 'd to me , that one Thomas Fernley came up to my Chambers in Furnival's-Inn , and looked into a Closet with Glass Doors , which is in the Dining-Room , and saw a little Chest ; that he asked the Prisoner what it was , and he told him my Servant Simon Kidder said there was Money in it ; on which Fernley said he would have some of it ; the Prisoner then threatned to inform me of it , if he persisted in his Intention . Fernley not regarding that , went up to the Bureau , and whether it was locked or not , I ca n't say , but he took out of it 2 Keys , with which he endeavoured to open the Glass Doors , but could not . Upon that he pulled out of his Pocket a Piece of Wire , and the Prisoner again said he would tell me of it , and accordingly went half down the Stain , pretending to come to me , hoping by that Mean to frighten Feruley and make him desist from his Design . When the Prisoner came up again he found the Glass Doors open , and saw Feruley take out of his Pocket a Nail with a wooden Handle with which he endeavoured to open the Chest , but could not ; and at last looking about he found the Key of the Chest in a China Bason , but having bent the Pipe of the Lock he could not get the Key in 'till he had straiten 'd it . He then opened the Chest , and the Prisoner again ran down Stairs , threatning to inform me , but returned , and then saw that Feruley had taken out of the Chest a Canvass-bag , and was telling the Money over on a green Table . The Prisoner desired him to desist , but he would not , and desired the Prisoner to partake of the Money , and threatned him hard on his Refusal . At last through many Persuasions he was prevailed upon to take 7 or 8 Thirty-six Shilling Pieces , one 6 s. and 9 d. and a 13 s. and 6 d. The Prisoner then desired to put the Money into the Bag again , fearing he should be discovered by a Medal which he had taken as Part of his Share , and therefore designed to put it into the Bag again , but instead of that , in his Hurry he put in a Brass Porte-Bells Pocket-piece . A few Minutes after this , perceiving his Mistake , he took out the Pocket-piece , and put the Medal into the Bag . The Prisoner likewise confessed , that this Money was to be lodged with one James Freeman , in whose Hands I found 2 Hangers , 3 Thirty-six Shilling Pieces , and a Guinea , which was all that remained unspent . Q . Was the Prisoner Servant to you ? Mr . Rash . I employed him as a Hackney-writer , and during the Time he was in my Service , he behaved very well . John Child . Mr . Rash informing me that he had been robbed , I made an Enquiry , and found that the Prisoner and another had been very lavish in spending their Money at Furnival's-Inn-Cellar , and this giving us sufficient Reason to suspect him , he was apprehended , and I heard him make this Confession of which Mr . Rash has given an Account . James Freeman . Some Time in last February , the Prisoner and Fernley left about 20 l. in my Hands , with some of this Money they bought each of them Watches and Hangers , and used to leave them with me every Night , and fetch them again in the Morning . I have here 3 Thirty-six Shilling Pieces and a Guinea which they left with me , but the last Time they were together , the Prisoner laid down his Watch on the Table , and Fernley took it up and went off with it . DEFENCE . Mary Sharew . I have known the Prisoner a long Time , and always took him to be an honest Lad . Richard Clark . The Prisoner is now about 14 Years of Age , and I have known him ever since he was born . I never heard that he wronged any Body , nor ever saw him fuddled or concerned in Liquor in my Life . Jacob Harbin . I have known him 8 Years . As to his Character , I always heard that he was a sober Lad both to himself and his Parents . His Father was as honest a Man , and his Mother as ever was born . Thomas Peele . I have known him above a Year , and never heard no Ill of him in my Life . John Mayes .

And that Moment he fired his Pistol and shot me . I then gave him about 4 or 5 s. and he demanded my Watch , but I said to him , You Rascal , I never carry any . Q .

It was on the 4th of March , and the Sun was not quite set . Daniel Jones . All that I can say is , that the Prisoner was delivered to me , and I carried him before the Justice . - Williams . I was coming from Work , and saw the Prisoner drinking Part of a Pint of Wine with another Man at the 3 Horseshoes on Finchley-Common . He told that Man in my hearing , that he was a Highwayman , his Name was Car , and he had just shot a Gentleman on the Top of the Hill . He then went off bidding the Man good Night , and said he would never hurt a Brother Trade . Upon this I pursued him down a Bottom , and his Horse running against a Post at Brown's-Well he dropped off , and took to his Heels , and left his Horse and his Hat and Wig behind him . - Lewsome . I know nothing of the Prisoner , only hearing a Hue and Cry of a Highwayman I went after him when he had quitted his Horse , and assisted in taking him . John Norvey .

This was about 9 o'Clock at Night , and in about an Hour 's Time I went Home , and found my Window wide open ; there had been a Pane of Glass taken out to open it , and put in again . Q . Did you leave any Person in your House when you went out ? Hambler . No , the Prisoner , I , and my Wife , all went out together . When I came Home and saw the House in this Condition , I desired my Wife not to go in , so I drew my Hanger and went in , and saw that a Box had been broke open , and the Goods mentioned in the Indictment taken out . The next Morning the Prisoner came to me at 6 o'Clock and told me he could not go with me ; I then went about the Neighbourhood to enquire for disorderly Persons , and was informed by a Woman that a tall thin Man ran by with a Bundle and dropp 'd a Cap which proved to be mine . Upon this I suspected the Prisoner , and got a Warrant to search for my Goods , and found one of my Shirts on the Prisoner 's Bed , at the Elephant and Castle in Drury-Lane . I then apprehended him , and he carried me to another Alehouse and delivered me some more of my Things . After this I carried him before Justice Poulson , and imagining he had got my Stockings on his Legs , I said it they were mine they were darred in the Toe with light grey Worsted , and on their being pulled off they appeared to be mine .

I had been washing some of these Things that Afternoon and they were taken away wet . Q . How is this Window fastened ? Mary Hambler . There is an Iron Masp to fasten it , but the Window Shutters were not put up , and this Pane of Glass which was taken out was just against the Hasp of the Window . Prisoner . Was the Window shut when she went out ? Hambler . Yes , I am very sure it was , and when I came back it was wide open . Robert Rhodes . The Prosecutor brought a Warrant to me to search the Prisoner 's Quarters , at the Elephant and Castle in Drury-Lane . As soon as he saw me he ran backwards , but I took him , and found one of Hambler 's Shirts on his Bed . After I had found this Shirt , the Prisoner said he would carry us to the Place where the rest of the Things were , and accordingly I went with him to the Bear and Ragged staff , and a Woman delivered these Things to me . These Stockings I took off the Prisoner 's Legs , and they were owned by the Prosecutor Hambler . Martha Reynolds . The Prisoner came to me the Day after the Robbery was committed , and said he had an Apron for me ! I asked him how he came by it ? and he said he took these Things from a Woman man that kept him Company while he was at Camp , on Account of her detaining some white Stockings of his , which she had to wash . He came soon afterwards and left the rest of the Things with me , and then said , that he picked them up in a Bundle between Ludgate-Hill and Temple-Bar .

The Prosecutor came to Mr. Haines a Printer , who is a Prisoner in the King 's Bench , and Mr. Haines asked him in my Presence what he designed to do with the Prisoner : Hambler replied , I shall have a Tyburn-ticket which is worth 20 l. and part of a Reward , and if he does not give me an Equivalent , I will prosecute him . John Marshall , Serjeant . The Prisoner has been in our Regiment about a Year , and always behaved well . On Saturday was 3 Weeks a Man came to me , and said if my Officer would give the Prosecutor 5 l. he would make up the Matter , and throw in such a Bill that the Prisoner should not be hurt .

On the 11th of March , a little after 7 o'Clock in the Evening , as near as I can guess , I went out , and latched the Door fast after me . Coun . What fastening is there to the Door ? Wiat . There is an Iron Latch to the Door , and after I had shut it , I turned back and pushed against it that I might be sure it was fast . Richard French . I live in Plumb-tree Court , Holbourn . On the 11th of March last , about 8 o'Clock , I and my Maid were at Work in the Kitchen ; she sat next the Window , and I next the Chimney . As we sat thus , somebody knocked at the Kitchen Door with their Knuckles ; I desired the Maid to see who it was , and as soon as she had opened the Door , a Man asked her if one Mr. Briton did not live there ; she answered , no , and was going to shut the Door , and immediately the Prisoner and another burst in . The Prisoner came violently on me , and said , D - n you , you old Dog , I will do your Business for you : upon that , he made no more ado , but he put both his Hands about my Throat , to throttle me : I struggled and cried out Murder ! as much as I could , but no Body came to my Assistance . When he had throttled me so , he threw me across the Kitchen Grate , with my Head on the back of the Chimney , and flung himself on me and clapped both his Hands on my Mouth to stop my Breath . I kicked with my Feet as well as I could , and broke his Hold from my Mouth , and then I cried Murder twice . He then put his Hands on my Mouth again , so that I was almost suffocated ; at the same Time swearing , if I made the least Noise , he would certainly cut my Throat across . In this Condition I continued 'till my Servant , who was at Work in the Yard , being alarmed at the Noise , came and took the Prisoner from me . Prisoner . Ask him whether I did not lodge with him some Time ago ; and whether he did not threaten to serve me with a Copy of a Writ for Money which I owed him ? French . He lodged about 7 Weeks with me , and owed me nine Shillings at that Time : I was very glad that I could get him out of my House , and never went after him in my Life for the Money . Prisoner . Did not I propose to pay you some Money that Night ? French . No , he never mentioned a Word of Money . Prisoner . Could you not have seen my Face if we had been out of Doors , without a Light ? French . No , I am certain I could not , for it was almost 8 o'Clock at Night , and it had been dark the best Part of an Hour . Coun . May not a Person lift up the Latch of your outward Door , without your hearing it ? French . Yes , very easily . Sarah Goodwin . I was sitting at the Table with my Master on the 11th of March , and heard somebody rap at the Kitchen Door ; I opened it a little Way , and saw 2 Men in the Passage : one of them asked for one Mr. Briton ; I told them he did not live in our House , and was going to shut the Door , but a Foot stopped it , and that Moment a Fellow pushed the Door open against me , and dragged me to the other Side of the Room , and threw me down . When I was on the Ground , he throttled me and squeezed my Throat all Manner of Ways , so that I was almost dead . The Prisoner flew on my Master , and threw him across the Grate , but the other Fellow used me in such a Manner that I was not able to make any farther Observations . Prisoner . What Time was this ? Goodwin . It was very near 8 o'Clock . Prisoner . Was it light ? Goodwin . No , it was so dark that I am sure I could not have distinguished one Person 's Face from another 's in the Street . Prisoner . Did not I say that I came to pay her Master nine Shillings ? Goodwin . No , there was not a Word spoke about Money ; but the other Man asked for Briton , and the Prisoner was then standing behind him . Israel Mitchel . On the 11th of March , between 7 and 8 o'Clock , I was at Work in our Shop , which is in the Yard , and heard a Sort of a Noise , something like a rattling in a Man 's Throat . I did not go down then , but hearing the same Noise about a Minute afterwards , I took this Stick and went into the Kitchen . When I came into the Passage , I saw a Man stand with the Street Door in his Hand , and on going into the Kitchen , I saw the Maid standing in a frightful Posture , and my Master across the Grate , and the Prisoner before him with both his Hands on my Master 's Throat . Coun . Where was your Master then ? Mitchel . He was lying a cross the Fire , and the Prisoner was upon him with his Hands on my Masster 's Throat . I stood still to observe what Motions the Prisoner made , but could observe no more than there is in this Stick Upon that I laid hold of his Collar , and fell to beating him as hard as my Hands would meet him ; and he made out as hard as he could . I then pursued him and struck up his Heels and he fell down some Steps at the End of the Court , but before I could get up to him , he recovered himself and took to his Heels again , and was taken by a Man who was passing by . Prisoner , Is it not possible for People to go in and out of your House without your hearing of them ? Mitchel . Yes . DEFENCE . Prisoner . I owed this Man nine Shillings when I left his House , and I not being able to pay him , he threatned to serve me with the Copy of a Writ , and that Night I went to his House to offer to pay him at 2 s. a Time . This Maid opened the Door , and as soon as the Prosecutor saw me , he flew into a violent Passion , and abused me grossly before I touched him . Robert Barret . I have known the Prisoner between 3 and 4 Years ; he always behaved himself honestly . I never heard that he was spiteful or malicious , and do n't believe he would murder any Body . John Peacock . I keep a Public-House , and have known the Prisoner 3 Months . I do n't take him to be of a malicious Temper , and ca n't believe that he would be guilty of Murder . Acquitted . 35.

Mary Davis . Last September was twelve Months , I left my House at Fulham , and came to a House in Town ; and on the 2d of October , Word was brought me that my House was broke open and robbed . As soon as I had recovered my Surprise , I took Coach and went to my House , and found the back Scullery Window taken out , and the Frame lying on the Ground . When I went up Stairs I found most of the Locks broke , and where the Locks were whole , the Doors were split in 'peces . I ca n't remember what Goods I lost , but I missed 4 Feather Beds , Bolsters and Pillows , and a great many Blankets . Abraham Astley . I am a Broker and live in Harp-Alley . On the 1st of October the Prisoner offered me 2 Stove-Grates for Sale , but I suspecting them to be stolen , stopped the Grates , and him too . I took him to an Alehouse , and while I was talking with some People , he ran away , and I never saw him again 'till now . After this I took a Boat and went to Fulham to search the Prisoner 's House , and found this Glass in a Chest of Drawers , and a Sconce-Glass under his Bed , but he was not at Home himself . Mrs. Davis . This Glass is mine , and one of the three which I lost at that Time . - Lacey . I was Constable of Fulham , and this Man desired me to search the Prisoner 's House : Accordingly I did , and the first Thing I found was one Feather Bed under another , and then this Glass , a Window Curtain , and 10 or 15 Blankets ; some of the Things were in one Place , some in another . After we had searched about some Time , we perceived a Sort of a Closet , and on demanding an Entrance into it , the Prisoner 's Wife said , there was nothing but Corn in it ; however , I took a Poker , threw the Door off the Hooks , and found 2 Bolsters , 10 Blankets , a Box of China , and 2 Feather Beds under the Corn . Prisoner . He says he took a Poker to force the Door open , was it locked or bolted ? Lacey . The Door opens into the Closet , and it was so secured that we could hardly get it open . George Brown . I live next Door to Mrs. Davis at Fulham . My Daughter informed me that some Damage was done at Mrs. Davis 's , upon that I went down the Garden and saw the Parlour Door open . I stepped in and cried Holla ! who is in the House ! But no Body answering , I went round the House and saw the Kitchen Doors open ; a Window Case taken out of the Brick Work and thrown on the Ground , and the Casement lying by it . I then called my Neighbours , and we went in together , and saw that the House had been ranshackled very much . The Prisoner is a Neighbour of mine , he is a Jack-smith , and a very industrious Man as far as I know , for he never did me any Harm . Council . What Character does the Prisoner bear ? Brown . Some Neighbours give him a good Character , and some a bad one . Mr. Miller . Being well informed how this Matter stood , and knowing the Prisoner to have absconded some Time , I met him in the Strand and told him I would not part with him till I had brought him to Justice . I asked him how he came by those Goods which were found in his House , and he said they were given to him by a Person who was apprehensive of an Arrest ; but when he saw Mrs. Davis , he said they were brought into his House by William Warren . I have known the Prisoner 6 or 7 Years , and always knew him to be a loose , idle Fellow , and used to spend whole Days in an Alehouse , and work at Night . Prisoner . Mr. Warren came to my House and said , he was afraid his Goods would be seized , and I gave him the Key and he brought them to my House . John Car . I have known the Prisoner above 30 Years . He worked for me about a Year ago , and always made his Accompts good to me . Mary Strut . All that I can say is , that I had been to see a Gentlewoman who is sick about 12 a Clock at Night , and saw Warren go into the Prisoner 's House with a Bundle on his Back . As to the Prisoner 's Character , I never heard but that he was a very honest Man . John Wager . I have known the Prisoner 30 Years , he will go to the Alehouse and so , but he is a very honest Man for all that . Council . Does he hear as good a Character now , as he did 30 Years ago ? Wager . I ca n't say that . Jacob Thompson . The Prisoner was a Neighbour of mine , but has been gone away ever since the Talk of this Robbery ; and some of our Neighbours give him a good Character and some the reverse . Another . The Prisoner rented a Shop of me about 3 Years ago , but I have not known any Thing of him since . Henry Salkin . I am his Brother-in-law , and never heard a bad Character of him before . William Hat . I have known the Prisoner 30 Years , but I have not seen him these 3 Months till now . I have had Dealings with him for Shoes for my Horses , and never heard a bad Character of him , only he would drink a Mug of Beer now and then . Prisoner .

Adams came up to me with a Watchman , and desired me to see what I had lost : They waked me , and I put my Hand in my Pocket , and all the Articles belonging to me were gone .

Alexander Bois . On the 16th of March last between 10 and 11 at Night , I was going through Long-Lane , and had a pair of Bags with me full of Hair : I live in Black Swan-Court , in Golden-Lane , and was going Home . I had nothing in my Pocket , my Bags were on my left Shoulder , and had in them brown Hairs , pale Hairs , ash-coloured Hairs , grey brown Hairs and grizzled Hairs , to the Value of about 8 l. as near as I can guess . The Prisoner followed me down the Lane , and in a Minute 's Time I was down , and my Bags were taken from me . I ca n't give a true Account who put me down , I was not knocked down , I was shot down or pushed down , for I am sure I could not fall myself . The Hairs which I had fell down with me , and were taken away . Upon this I advertised them , but could get no Account of them till Mr. Boucher informed me that he had bought some of the Prisoner . Q . Did not your Bags fall from you ? Bois . I felt somebody snatch my Bags away , and they went off as I felt ; - I have a Guess , - a rough Guess how they went . Q . Might not the Bags fall with you ? Bois . To the best of my Thought they were taken away . Prisoner . Was he not fuddled ? Bois . Yes , I was in Liquor , but I had my Senses about me . Prisoner . I never saw him till I was before the Justice , and then he swore I took the Bags off his Back . Bois . What I do I will answer , but I leave it to the whole World whether any Body else could take them , when no Body else was near me . David Murrin . My Business is to buy Hair . On the 22d or 23d of March , I was going up Long-Lane , and this Gentlewoman at the Bar called me and James Stevenson into a House and shewed us some Hairs : - It was the House of one Mr. Cobb , a Bird-Cage Maker , about the middle of the Lane . She offered us 3 Pieces of dark brown , and one Piece of light pale Hair , and said she could help us to a larger Quantity , and she promised to come again to Stevenson 's House the next Morning , but she never did . Robert Paterson . I had these Hairs from a Bird-Cage Maker 's in Long-Lane , and they have been in my Custody ever since . Prosecutor . These are the very same that I lost that Night . James Stevenson . On the 23d of March , Murrin and I were going about to buy Hair , and the Prisoner called us in . She carried us into an upper Room in the Bird-Cage Maker 's House and shewed us 3 Pieces of dark Hair and one Piece of pale Hair , which Bois bought of me ; but not agreeing for the Price , she said she would come to my House , and help me to some other Hair . She not coming according to her promise , I went to search for her , but could not find her , and coming Home , I met Hannah Smith , the Daughter of Thomas Boucher , I watched her into a House , and the Prisoner seeing me promised again to come to my House with more Hair ; and therefore I did not take her at that Time ; but on her not coming I searched Cobb 's House , and fou nd 87 pieces of Hair and these Bags locked up in a Box , in the same Room where she shewed me the 3 Locks of Hair . Prisoner . I have the Person here that found these Hairs in Smithfield . Thomas Boucher . The Prisoner brought some Hair to me , and I bought it of her for a Shilling and a full pot of Beer , which was more than it was worth . Soon afterwards I read the News-paper and saw it advertised ; upon that I made it my Business to find out the Prosecutor , but when he saw it , he said he believed it was not his . The next Morning he brought Stevenson to me , and he said it was the very same Hair which the Prosecutor bought of him . The Prosecutor was 3 Years in Newgate for Perjury , and he told me , that he could not tell how nor when he lost his Bags , and I believe they are Spanish Goods . Prosecutor . I was in Newgate some Time , but it was only for forfeited Recognizances . Hannah Smith . I have known the Prisoner a long Time , and to my Knowledge she is a very honest Woman . She gave me 3 pieces of Hair to dispose of for her , but the Prosecutor took them from me , and threatned to send me to Newgate . John Cobb . I found the Hair in Smithfield , between 11 and 12 at Night , on the 16th of March ; and delivered them to the Prisoner to lay by for me . Ann Smith .

How did you find the parlour Window ? Ukely . It was pushed up as high as it would go . Prisoner . How near is this parlour to the Room where you was sitting ? Ukely . About 2 Yards or a Yard and half . Elizabeth Brocas . The Night that Mr. Dearmore 's House was robbed , I shut the outside Shutters of the parlour window . Q . Did you observe how light it was at that Time ? Brocas . It was dark . Prisoner . Could you distinguish one Man 's Face from another ? Brocas . No , I could not , when I shut the Window . Prisoner . How did you fasten the Windows ? Brocas . I put them to , and shut them as close as I could without bolting ; and when the House was robbed , the Shutters were opened and the Sash pushed up as high it would go . Jervis Trueman . On the 2d of March about 7 at Night , the Prisoner John Lowdon and Aleck O-Flack brought a Bundle of Things to my House , in a white coarse Apron . I ca n't say what Things they were , but they left this Curtain with me . John Dearmore . This Curtain is mine , and is part of the Goods which I lost . Q . When did you see this Curtain in your House ? Dearmore , I went into the parlour about 7 o'Clock the same Evening it was stolen , and then it was there . Prisoner . Was it light or dark when you saw it ? Dearmore . It was dark . Prisoner . Was it light enough to distinguish one Person 's Face from another ? Dearmore . I opened the Stair-Case Window , and there was a Person singing Ballads , but it was so dark that I could not see whether it was Man or Woman . Joseph Pratt . I have known the Prisoner from a Child , and never knew him do an ill Thing in my Life . William Runnington . I have known him from a Child , and never heard any Misdemeanour of him in my Life . Acquitted . 58. John Theobalds the younger was indicted for Barretry . The Council for the Prosecution set forth , that the Prisoner stood charged with Barretry , and that it was Matter of Concern to see a Man who had been brought up in an honourable prosession , so far demean himself , as to stir up Suits among his Majesty 's Subjects , to get Money to himself and distress his Fellow Creatures . That the Prisoner was charged with 15 separate Articles of Barretry , and if there should be proof of three only , that would be sufficient to convict him of this Offence , & c. The 4th Article against the Prisoner was read , the Substance of which was , That he the said Theobalds , on or about the 13th Day of July 1739 , at the House of William Castledine , did incite and persuade him the said Castledine , to join with him in a Bill of Indictment against John Drinkwater for Barretry ; which Bill of Indictment by the procurement of the said Theobald , was preferred to the Grand Jury of Middlesex , and by them found a true Bill . And on or about the 18th of July , by Vertue of the Lord Chief Justice Lee 's Warrant , he the said Drinkwater was carried to Woodstreet Compter , and there detained till he gave Bail ; and afterwards on the 3d of December he the said Drinkwater was tried for the same Offence and acquitted . [ Here the Record of the Drinkwater 's Acquittal was read . ] Joseph Williams . The Prisoner , Castledine , I and some more , had a Meeting together at the Salutation-Tavern in Holbourn , and there it was agreed between them , that an Indictment should be preferred against Drinkwater for Barretry : Theobalds said it would be a Means to bring him to Terms . In a little Time afterwards the Bill was preferred to the Grand Jury , and the Prisoner himself told me it was found a true Bill . Council . Was there any Mention made of an Act of Barretry that Drinkwater had done ? Williams . No , there were some Indictments between Drinkwater and Castledine , and the Prisoner said that would bring Drinkwater to Terms . Lydia Goodwin . I heard Theobalds say , if Drinkwater was cast for Barretry , it was a very hard Thing , for it was what few people understood . Hannah Thomas . The first Time that I heard any Thing of this Affair , Theobalds came in , and said he had found out a new Way to punish Drinkwater : Then Griffits , Castledine , the Prisoner and another went into the parlour to consult together , and soon afterwards the Bill was found . Prisoner . Where was all this Discourse ? Thomas . At Castledine 's House in Johnson's-Court , Fleet-street . Jonathan Bellamy . I was Constable of St. Bride 's , and had a Warrant against Drinkwater given me by Castledine . I apprehended him , and Theobalds gave me a Guinea for my Trouble . Robert Willis . I was at Hick's-Hall , and saw Mr. Theobalds , Griffits , and one James Maul go in , they returned presently and said the Bill was found . DEFENCE . William Griffits . I was concerned in this Bill against Drinkwater , and my Name was on the Back of the Bill , but I ca n't tell who were concerned in framing it . I did design to prosecute Drinkwater , because he had done me an Injury . Council . Was not this Thing set on Foot without your Knowledge ? Griffits . No , I heard that such a Thing was intended , and I joined in it . Council . Was there not a Cause depending at that Time against Castledine , for keeping a Bawdy-House ? Griffits . I am not positive of that . The Reason why I designed to prosecute Drinkwater was this : He met me and abused me very much , and in about 3 Quarters of an Hour , he served me with the Copy of a Writ . This was in Easter Term , so Castledine employed a Man to take it in Hand , and they got Judgment against me by Default . As soon as this was done , he countermanded Trial , and when I brought it on before the Lord Chief Justice Willes I nonsuited him , and the next Term at Guild-Hall he swore he had no Notice of Trial ; when that very Morning he delivered a Brief into his Council 's Hand . As to Drinkwater 's general Character , he always was looked upon to be a very litigious Man . Mr. Cummins . About 2 Years and half ago , I was Tipstaff of the Court of King's-Bench , and having a Warrant against Drinkwater , I carried him to my own House , and he behaved himself there in such a Manner , as frighted my Wife very much - I do n't think there is such another litigious Fellow in London . Here the 5th Article against the Prisoner was read , the Substance of which was , that he the said Theobalds on or about the 13th of July 1739 , did persuade William Castledine to join with him in a Bill of Indictment against John Drinkwater ; which Bill was preferred to the Grand Jury , and found a true Bill ; on which such proceedings were had , that afterwards at the Sessions of the Peace , he the said Drinkwater was tried and acquitted . [ The Indictment against Drinkwater was read . ] Joseph Williams . Theobalds told me there was a Bill found against Drinkwater in London , and that he was on the Back of it as a Witness against him . There was a Bill then depending against Castledine for keeping a Bawdy-House , and Theobalds said , the Way to perplex Drinkwater and bring him to Terms , was to indict him for Barretry . Prisoner . At Hicks's-Hall they got off by an Artifice , and we were informed that an Indictment for this Offence need not be local , and therefore brought this in London . The purport of the 8th Article was , That he the said Theobalds contriving to vex John Drinkwater , did apply to Nathaniel Delander and William Lowton , to prosecute the said Drinkwater for a Felony , in receiving 8 l. 8 s. of the said Delander for a Watch , and not discovering the Felon who stole the same : That a Bill was exhibited to the Grand Inquest and found a true Bill , on which Indictment such proceedings were had , that he the said Drinkwater was acquitted . * [ The Indictment against John Drinkwater was read . ] * See Session's-Book 1739 , No . 8 . Pag . 164. William Lawton . I was summoned before Mr. De Veil , and when I came there I saw Mr. Theobalds , and he would have persuaded the Colonel to give me my Oath , how I lost the Watch ; I thought it very hard that I should be called on to tell a long Story , and therefore refused to give any Account ; however I received a Subpoena to appear before the Grand Jury , but I was not called , and after that , Theobalds told me the Bill was found , and he had done without me . Prisoner . Did you never swear that this Watch was stolen from you ? Lawton . No , I never did , nor ca n't . Prisoner . You say you ca n't tell how you lost this Watch . He was in a Bawdy-House , and this Watch was taken , and all the Inside of it was taken , and the Shagreen Case found in his Fob : - Every Subject has a Right to prosecute by Jonathan Wild 's Act . Did I not appear as an Attorney in that Cause ? Lowton . I believe he did . Elizabeth Rayner . I was Servant to Mrs. Deborah Pope , when she was in Trouble about this Watch ; and Mr. Theobalds would have given me 5 Guineas to swear against Drinkwater whom I never saw . I was to swear that I saw Drinkwater give Mrs. Pope 4 Guineas on Account of the Watch , that it might be paid back ! Lydia Goodwin . I do n't know any Thing of Theobalds being concerned in the prosecution of Drinkwater about the Watch , for I believe Castledine carried it on . Hannah Thomas . I used to be always at Castledine 's House , and I think I heard Theobald say in the parlour , that he promoted this prosecution against Drinkwater , and it was to transport him on some Act , but I ca n't tell what . Joseph Williams . Theobalds was concerned in the prosecution of Drinkwater , but I believe he was employed as an Attorney by Castledine . There were divers other Articles exhibited against the Prisoner , but there not being sufficient Evidence he was acquitted . 59. Samuel Ellard , was indicted for privately stealing 18 s. 9 d. the Money of William Shipman , in his Shop ; March 9 . William Shipman . On the 9th of March last between 9 and 10 at Night . I had been at Supper , and going to drink afterwards , a Neighbour came in and cried , Stop Thief ! Shipman ! upon that I ran to the Counter , and caught the Prisoner coming from behind it : I stopped him , and he said , he would swear a Robbery against me , if I offered to stop him . He struggled hard against me to get loose , and a Neighbour accidentally open 'd the Door , else he had been gone from me , for I could not hold him . Then we secured him , and I sent for a Brother Constable , and searched him . I missed about 20 s. 3 three Pences or Groats , out of my Till , and before the Prisoner was searched I described the pieces that I had lost . I said there were about 20 s. and a half Crown among them , 2 King Charles 's three pences , and a King William 's three pence or Groat ; accordingly when he was searched , this Money was taken out of his pocket , which appears to be the same that I described . William Lane . The Prosecutor sent for me to take Charge of the Prisoner . I asked Shipman before I would search the Prisoner , what pieces he had lost ? he said there were about 18 or 19 s. and a half Crown among them , and 3 three pences or Groats , one of which had a Hole in it . Upon that I asked the Prisoner what Money he had in his pocket ; but he refusing to let me know , I searched him , and found a half Crown , 2 Groats , and a 3 pence besides other Silver . Elizabeth Holmes . I was coming into the Prosecutor 's Shop to buy some Thing , and saw the Prisoner behind the Counter with his hand in the Drawer : upon that I called the Prosecutor , and he then said he was robbed . John King . I was going to my Neighbour 's House between 9 and 10 that Night , and heard Theives cried out ; and just as I got to the Door , it was shut . I forced in and took hold of the Prisoner 's Collar , but he was so resty that we could hardly keep him from getting clear . When he found that we were determined to hold him , he fell to cursing and swearing in a prodigious Manner , and the Prosecutor being an Officer , I persuaded him to send for another , and when he came , I saw the Money taken out of the Prisoner 's pocket . Prisoner . The Money was my own , and I never was behind the Counter . Guilty Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 60 . 61. Ann Jewers , and Sarah Brown of St. George 's Middlesex were indicted for stealing a Straw Hat , value 6 d. the Goods of Sarah Dake , and 3 s. 6 d. the Money of Henry Priest ; March 19 . Sarah Dake . I went to a Cellar in the Back-lane , the Corner of Well-close Square , to enquire for a Friend , and she desired me to sit down . Accordingly I staid about half an Hour , and this Money being loose in my Bosom , I was afraid it would drop out ; and so I went to take it out to put it into my pocket , and then Sarah Brown thrust her Hand down my Bosom by main Force , and said , you B - give me your Money ! the Prisoner Jewers held my Hand while the other took my Money . After this , I came up to the Stair-head , and cried Murder , and then they took my Hat away . Prisoners Jewers . She had but half a Crown in the World , and she called for Liquor . Sarah Long . Hearing Murder cried , I ran out into the Street and saw three or four upon this Girl , and I heard Sarah Brown say , D - the B - I have got her Hat . Prisoners Jewers . This Girl ( Dake ) came to the Cellar for her Sister : she sat down several Minutes , and called for several Quarterns of Liquor ; I changed her half a Crown to pay for it , and after that , she had more Drams . Dake . They gave me two small Glasses , and said , if did not drink it , they would either throw it in my Face or down my Bosom . Both Guilty . 62. Michael Thickston , of St. George Hanover Square was indicted for stealing a Silk Purse , value 6 d. and twenty two Guineas , the Money of Edward Armison : in the Dwelling House of Catharine Strickland , Feb. 26 . Edward Armison . I am Servant to the Lady Strickland , and this Money was in a purse in a Chest of Drawers , in the Room where I lay . I saw the Money in my Chest , about 10 Days before I missed it . On my complaining of my Loss , my Lady ordered all the Servants Boxes to be searched , but nothing was found . This Search was on a Thursday Night , and on the Friday Night the Prisoner who was postilion to my Lady , made off . In a few Days afterwards , he was taken in southwark , and had changed his Name to that of George Robinson , that he might not be known . The Person who apprehended him sent for me , and I went before 2 Justice with him ; but he would not confess any Thing , only said he changed his Name , because he had got a Woman with Child , and was apprehensive of being troubled on that Account . After this he was searched , and 10 Guineas and 11 s. found upon him , which he said were given him by a Woman whom he was to marry ; but when he was called on to produce that Woman , he could not . Prisoner . Did you ever see me take the Money ? Armison . No , I never saw him take it ; but he asked me to lend him some Money , about a Fortnight before this Robbery , and I refused it . Prisoner . Was the Drawer in which you put your Money locked ? Armison . I am not certain whether it was or not . Prisoner . Did you never say you lost the Key of your Drawers ? Armison . Yes , I lost the Key , and had a new one made , but never altered the Lock . John Bell . I and my Fellow Servant , Thickston , searched the Drawers and the Room all over , but found nothing : then I asked him if any Body saw him put the Money into the Drawers , and he said no Body did but the Postilion . Armison . The Prisoner was in the Room when I put my Money into the Drawers . Bell . On Thickston 's complaining of his Loss , all our Boxes were searched , but nothing found ; and then we thought the Prisoner looked the most suspicious of any Body in the House ; and my Lady Strickland going out that Evening , the Prisoner took an Opportunity to pack up his Things , and went off , although at the same Time he had Money due to him for Wages .
