Grace Prior , of the Parish of St. Giles in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing 11 Guineas , and some Silver , from the Person of Lewis Clifton , on the 15th of September last . Clifton swore he went into the Prisoner 's House to drink a Dish of Coffee , and in a little time the Prisoner came in , who kept the House , sate down by him , and ask 'd him if he would drink any Brandy ; to which he consented , and drank 3 Quarterns , and paid for 'em ; after which she ask 'd him to go up Stairs , where he drank 6 or 7 more , and then fell asleep upon the Bed ; but in half an Hour 's time she wak 'd him , and he call 'd for more Brandy , but feeling in his Pocket , he found all his Silver , about 21 s. gone , and the Guineas mention 'd in the Indictment taken out of his Fobb : Upon this he told the Prisoner she had rob 'd him , who denied it ; but bid him go down along with her , and she would make him easy ; which he did , and afterwards the Prisoner , and her Maid went out , and he follow 'd them , but being very near sighted , he lost them , and return 'd to the House , where he found the Prisoner , who told him he was drunk , and had never been there . Upon this he was ask 'd if he could be sure the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person that took away his Money ; and thereupon going close to the Bar , he look 'd her in the Face about a Minute before he answer 'd she was the same Person . The Prisoner , in her Defence , deny 'd his drinking in her House at all ; but said he came into it very drunk with a Woman , and ask 'd for a private Room ; and she not having any Mind to oblige him , turn 'd him out ; and some time after , he came again , and said she pickt his Pocket . Her Maid confirm 'd the same , and the Constable swore , the Prisoner 's House was of no ill Repute as he knew of ; tho ' he was a Neighbour .

She depos 'd farther , that the Prisoner pull 'd out his Knife , and swore he would be her Butcher if she did not yield , or if ever she told her Mother any thing of it . The Prisoner in his Defence said , He was at his Father 's that Evening , from 5 a Clock till 12 , about remarkable business and brought several to prove it ; who agreed in their Evidence .

It appear 'd , That as Hunt was riding in the Road toward Enfield , at the Bottom of Stamford-Hill he saw the Prisoners , who said they were going to Hartford , and desir 'd him to let them ride , he having a led Horse , and they would make him drink ; he consenting to this , White got upon the Gelding , and Banister rode behind the Boy ; a little after this , this Evidence discover 'd Tutty , and being acquainted with him , they all rode together , till they came to a Place between Ponder 's End and Green-street , where White rode before Tutty , and turning upon him , bid him stand ; and with a Pistol in his Hand demanded his Money and his Horse , and took them away with his Coat , and the other Things mention 'd in the Indictment , and after they had taken off the Bridle from the Horse that the Boy rode on , cut his Girts , and turn 'd him up , they rode away . A little after this , the Horse White rode on threw him , and a Higler coming on the Road help 'd him up again , he being much hurt by his Fall , and while they were talking together , Tutty came up , and ask 'd the Higler if he did not see two Men upon Grey Geldings , White standing by him ; who immediately after that rode away , upon which the Higler and Tutty pursu 'd him , but the Prisoner soon quitted the Horse , and took to a Field , where he was taken . He confes 'd the Fact before a Justice , and gave Information where they might find Banister ; upon which the Evidence made Enquiry ; but not meeting with him , they contriv 'd a Letter for him , and sent it to his Sister , who presently went out to look for her Brother , and was follow 'd by the Evidence at a distance , they taking it by Turns to go foremost , to prevent Discovery ; at last she turn 'd short , andd met her Landlord , who ask 'd her what Business , brought her to that End of the Town ; she told him a Letter was come out of the Country for her Brother Banister and she had been up and down a great while , and could not find him , but believed she might find him by and by at a certain Gaming-house ; and then they parted , but he and his Companion went immediately to the Gaming-house she spoke of , and heard his Voice , upon which at last they broke open the Door , went in , and secur 'd him there .

Vicker 's the Clergy-man , who hath cured several People of the King 's Evil , Liveth in Sherbourne Lane near Lambard-Street . The Volatile Spirit of BOHEE-TEA . The first of this Kind that ever was made in England , which hath been found the most absolute case for Consumptions , inward Wastings , and all other Decays of Nature whatsoever , incident to Mankind : Being infinitely more Balsamick , healing to the Lungs , and fattening the whole Constitution , than the common Infusion of the Leaf in Water ; in so much that 15 or 20 Drops taken twice a Day in Ale , Wine , or a Dish of Bohee-Tea , sweeten 'd with the finest Loaf-Sugar , shall do more Service to weak Consumptive People in one Week , than all other Restoratives whatsoever , shall do in many Months , as hath been sufficiently experienc 'd from the great Quantities thereof sold to the Nobility and Gentry since its first Publication . It 's likewise 's a very rich Cordial for chearing the Heart when oppress 'd with Melancholy and Vapours ; being also of that sovereign Use , as to give Ease and Relief in the Cholick , violent Pains of the Head , Coughs and Phtisicks , when all other Medicines have failed . Neither is it more strange than true , that a Gentleman by taking one Bottle , voided three Ounces and a half of Gravel , which may be seen at the Place of Sale . This Spirit mix 'd with Punch makes one of the most agreeable Liquors in the World ; and takes of the Crudities of a cold Phlegmatick Stomach , oppressed with Wind or Water , no one Thing can be more effectual . To create an Appetite , to expel nauseous Humours offending the Stomach and to prevent Vomitings and Reachings in the Morning , there is no better Remedy in the World , of much greater Efficacy than the bitter Draught . It 's likewise a special Antidote against any Infection of the Air , and if 15 Drops be taken going to Bed , in a Glass of Spring-Water , never faileth to procure a sound Sleep . A Gentleman extremely afflicted with the Gout , by taking 10 Drops of this Volatile Spirit in a Glass of Spring-Water . Morning , Noon , and Night , was wonderfully eased of his Pains and Lameness . And as this Volatile Spirit is chymically extracted from the purest and finest Tea that can be had , so is it likewise a certain Remedy in all the above mention 'd Cases . Price 2 s. 6 d. the Bottle . Note , People of an hot and feverish Constitution may take these Drops in Barley , or common Spring-Water . Sold now only at Batson 's Coffee-house against the Royal Exchange , Cornhill , and at no other Place . Sealed with Black Wax , having a double Coat of Arms , viz . Two Cinquefoils and a Bend charged with three Wheatsheaves , to prevent Counterfeits . At Her House at the Red Ball in Queen-street , Cheapside , near the Three Cranes , LIveth a Gentlewoman , the Daughter of an eminent Physician , who practis 'd in London upwards of 40 Years . She hath an Ointment call 'd the Royal Ointment for the Gout , and Rheumatick Pains , and of great Ease and Comfort to both Sexes , at Home and Abroad as hath been experience 'd by many who have carry 'd it with them into foreign Parts ; and is therefore of excellent Use for all Travellers . Thus is the Cure compleated ; as it well known to several of the Nobility and Gentry , who have experienc 'd it , and are ready to testify the Truth of its wonderful Success . She has also a certain and Infallible Cure for the Tooth-ach , without Drawing , and so effectually , that the Pain will never return again ; and not only so , but makes the Teeth as white as Ivory ; and fastens those that are loose to Admiration . She changes Red or Gray Hair in a few Days time , not to be distinguish 'd from a natural Complexion . Note , Remov 'd from the Cheshire Cheese in Wall-brook . For the Good of the Publick . WHereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex in this Kingdom have contracted an evil Habit of Body , wherein the vicious Humours , at first dispersed through the whole , come at length to be lodg 'd in one Part or another , and many times ( for Causes too long to be here mentioned ) are thrown down upon the Womb , occasioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part , which being neglected , at last turns cancerous , and often proves fatal . I cure the Diabetes when given over by all other Persons . This is to acquaint all such as may have occasions , that a speedy Relief is to be had from an experienced Midwife , dwelling at the Sign of the Queens Arms , a Goldsmith 's Shop , near Exeter Charge in the Strand , who perform 'd a Cure upon a Lady at the Bath , after she was given over by Physicians ; and since has cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and Suburbs of London . David Povey , Remov 'd from Hatton-Garden near Exeter Exchanges in the Strand , London , Operator for the Teeth , who had the Honour to clean her Late Majesty 's Teeth , He sells a pleasant Dentrifice , being the same that King Charles the Second constantly used , it makes the Teeth as white as Ivory , and preserves them from Decaying : Destroying the Scurvy . He hath a Cephalick which certainly cures the Tooth-Ach in 2 Minutes Time ; if the Teeth are rotten , or uneven , and full of Holes , or black Specks , he will make them smooth , even sound and white , so that no Person shall distinguish where the defect had been : He Sets in Artificial Teeth so easy , neat and firm , that they need not be removed for some Years , and they may eat with them as well as with their former , and can not be distinguished from their Natural ones : He Sells a pleasant Water that takes all Pains and Imposthumes , or Swellings out of the Gums , and fastens loose Teeth , which several Persons of Quality know all this to be true . There are several Pretenders that put out a Powder for whitening the Teeth , and curing the Tooth-ach and Scurvey in the Gums , which I advise all Persons to beware of : For they do not know from whence any of those Distempers proceeds . But thank God I do . BOOKS printed for Andrew Bell , at the Cross Keys and Bible in Cornhill . The History of the most Remarkable Trials in Great Britain and Ireland in Capital Cases , viz .
