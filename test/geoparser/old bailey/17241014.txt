They were indicted the second Time for feloniously having in their Custody , and concealing Utensils for coining , the 31 st Day of August , 1724. Henry March depos 'd , that he being a Joiner or Cabinet-maker , & c. wrought as a Journeyman with Cartwright Richardson , and that both he and Austin sent him away from the Work-house ( which was not the Dwelling-house ) in Black Raven Court in Chiswell-street , about the latter End of February last , pretending they had some Experiments to make , by way of melting . That the next Morning he went to their Lodging for the Key of the Work house , and coming to it found Embers of Charcoal , some Crucibles and Metal . That Austin Richardson coming about 9 or 10 a Clock , he enquired what they had been doing : That thereupon he answered , that they had been making some Trials as to coining of Money , having melted Brass for that Purpose , but that he could not make it bear , but he had been told by a Friend of something that would do better , and he would try the Experiment with that . And that about the 8th or 9th of March following , they did coin with Several Metals mixt 12 Pieces in the Likeness of King Charles the Second 's Shillings , and 25 Pieces in the Likeness of Half Crowns : And that the Saturday Night following he went with Austin Richardson , and he put off one of these Half Crowns at a great Wholesale Grocers in Smithfield . And that some Days after , Cartwright Richardson ask 'd him ( this Evidence ) why he was afraid to put the Money off , telling him he had put off one of those Half Crowns at a Cheesemonger 's Shop in Drury-lane over against Covent-Garden ; but he reply 'd , he would be no farther concern 'd than he had been . And that then they bid him take care of the Tools , and he hid them under the Boards of a Floor in the Closet . That afterwards Austin Richardson was arrested , and he being with him in the Counter , he threatned to impeach him ( this Witness ) of Coining : Whereupon he thought best to secure himself , and therefore went to Mr. Morgan , who was ordered by Mr. Pinkney , Deputy-Warden of the Mint , to take care of the Affair of Coinage in his Absence , he being gone into the Country , and acquainted him with the Matter on Saturday the 22d of August . But being arrested on Monday on an Action of 20 l. by Cartwright Richardson , could not go to make out his Information as he had appointed Mr. Morgan , by reason that he was a Prisoner in the Marshalsea . Mr. Morgan depos 'd , that March did come to him the 22d of August , and inform 'd him that there were two Brothers that had been concerned in Coining , and he proposing to have them apprehended , he desired him to let it alone a Day or two longer , because one of the Brothers was out of the Way , promising he would come to him again the Monday following , but did not come ; and on Tuesday a Person came to him , and told him that Cartwright Richardson had arrested March , thrown him into Prison , and so he could not come to him . That he advis 'd him to get him to a Justice of the Peace to take his Examination ; and that afterwards he having given an Account where the coining Utensils were , they went with an Officer to apprehend Cartwright Richardson ( for Austin Richardson was then Prisoner in the Counter ) at his House in Swan-Alley near St. James 's , secured him , and took him with them the next Day when they went to sieze the Utensils . And taking up some Boards found them under the Floor , between the Floor and the Cieling in a Closet in Black Raven Court in Chiswell-street . Mr. Woodman depos 'd , that having received a Note from Henry March , he went to him , and he giving him an Account that he had been put in Prison at the Suit of the Prisoners , that he might not give his Information against the Prisoners : He went to Mr. Morgan in the Tower , and Measures were concerned to get Justice Nichols to take March 's Information , who went to the Prison to him and took it there ; that he also went and talk 'd with Cartwright Richardson , about arresting March , who sent for a Lawyer , to answer him ; who speaking in the Plural Terms , owned , that March did not owe them 20 l. but did owe some Money , but there were some Reasons for arresting him , in such a Sum , beyond his Capacity of getting Bail , and had they known that he would have done such a Thing to hang them , they would hang him . And that when Cartwright saw the Utensils taken out , he sell into an Agony and Fit , and said , The Lord have Mercy upon him , there is enough to hang an hundred People ; but said he knew nothing nothing of the Matter , but could not say as to his Brother , he had an ill Character . William Barret depos 'd , that when they went to apprehend Cartwright , at Austin 's House in Swan Alley , he was deny 'd ; but searching the House they broke open a Chamber Door , and found him , he not opening it : That when they told him , that they apprehended him for High-Treason , he reply 'd , I thought so . The finding the Tools as before depos 'd . was confirm 'd by several Evidences ; and Moulds , Crucibles , and Pieces of melted Mettal were produc 'd in Court ; and also a false Half Crown , which March swore was one of those coined by the Prisoners and himself . The Prisoners in their Defence utterly deny 'd the Fact , or having any Knowledge of the Utensils . As to the Utensils being found there , they insinuated they might be put there by March himself , by Way of Revenge , in that they had a Difference , he having pawned two of Austin 's Clock Cases , and stole their Tools , for which they had threatened to arrest him ; whereupon he threatened , That if they did , he would hang Austin . That March did come to Cartwright 's House , on Sunday the 23 d of August ( the Day after he had been and accused them to Mr. Morgan in the Tower ) and desired to have the Key of the House in Black Raven Court , ( where the Tools were found ) under Pretence of showing it to an Acquaintance of his Wife 's , a Midwife , in Order to take it , and kept the Key two Hours and a half , in which Time he might hide the Tools there , in Order to carry on his Plot against them . That he had the Key was prov 'd by two Evidences , and that he kept it near two Hours , by one of them , though March pretended he brought it again in Half an Hour ; but he did not produce this Midwife , or any Person , that did want to see it , in Order to take it . And it was highly probable , the Reason was , that when he went on the Saturday to Mr. Morgan , and gave him Notice of two Brothers , he did not consent to compleat his Information , not go immediately to apprehend them , but put it off till Monday , that he might have an Opportunity to get the Key on the Sunday , and put the Tools there : Which was more probable , in that his Pretence was , That Austin was out of the Way , when at the same Time he knew he was in the Compter . That as to their arresting him , it was not to prevent his proceeding in his Impeachment against them , but he did really owe them 4 l. 6 s. and call 'd Evidences to prove it . That the Reason of arresting him for so much beyond that Sum was , Because they were bound for him in several Sums . And though he was not arrested 'till the Monday after he had informed against them , they knew nothing at all that he had done so ; and though the Process against him was not Serv 'd upon him , it had been entred Several Days before . To lessen the Credit of March 's Evidence , they urg 'd , He was a Person of an infamous Character , had pawn 'd their Goods , stole their Tools , and did this in Revenge , because they had threatened to arrest him , for what he stood indebted to them . That he had been more than once convicted of Perjury , had stood in the Pillory at Rochester , and had burnt a Ship ; but they had not Records to prove it . They call 'd a great many Persons to their Reputation , who gave them a good Character . The Court also observ 'd , in Favour of the Prisoners , That the Proof of the putting off the two Half Crowns , the one by Austin , the other by Cartwright , depended intirely on the Credit of March 's Evidence , and that the Persons to whom they were said to be put off , tho ' living at no great Distance , were not produc 'd in Court , who might probably remember that they had about that Time taken such Money . Upon a full Hearing of the Matter , the Jury acquitted them of both Indictments . Benjamin Tyrrel , of St. John 's Hackney , was indicted for feloniously stealing a Brown Mare , value 6 l. the Property of Christopher Johnson , the 2 d of February last .

The Prosecutor depos 'd , That he met the Prisoner and another Woman in Gracechurch-street , he being in Drink , and that they went in a Coach to Hatton Garden , and being ask 'd , What he went there for ? He reply 'd , He could not tell , being in Liquor ; but , perhaps , to do what he should not do : But when he came out of the Coach he had lost his Money , yet he could not say the Prisoner took it . The Jury acquitted her . John Tailor , and Eli Reed , were indicted for breaking the House of William Woolley , in the Night-time , and stealing a Quilt , value 40 s. the Goods of Mary Thompson , the 10th of June last .

The Prisoner John Tailor pleaded , That he going Home saw two Men talking , and they ran away , and he found the Things upon the Bulk . Eli Reed pretended , He met with Tailor , and he ask 'd him to help him to a Lodging ; and he told him he would do it , and he then desir 'd him to carry a Bundle for him .

But the Prosecutor and Evidence not appearing , the Jury acquitted them .

That he afterwards took the Wig unknown to him , and carried it away . The Prisoner pleaded , He bought the Wig , that Maplesdon had him take it , and Maplesdon came to ask for him , and said he wanted 25 s. of him , for a Wig he bought of him : And afterwards told him another Time , when he said to him he was sorry he should take out a Warrant against him , That it was his own Fault , because he would not pay him for it .

After some considerable Debate : concerning some Preliminaries between the Counsel for the Appellant and Appellee , they agreed to join Issue upon the Prisoner 's Plea , which contain 'd some Matters in Bar , and others in Abatement . The Matters contained in the Defendant 's Plan , were as follows : 1 . That there was another Appeal ( besides that to which he now pleaded ) yet depending and undetermin 'd . 2 . A Misnomer , that his Name was not Lewis , but Loui . 3 . That the Addition of Labourer was not right , for that he was a Barber Chirurgeon , and not a Labourer . 4 . That there were no such Persons in rerum natura , as John Doe and Richard Roe ( mentioned as Pledges in the said Appeal . ) 5 . That Solomon Rondeau was not the proper Appellant , for that one Henry Rondeau was Brother and Heir to Ann Hussar , and Solomon was her Brother and Heir . 6 . That he was not guilty of the Fact charged in the Said Appeal . The Defendant failed in the Proof of his Plea : For it appeared , as to the First , by the Records of the Court , that the former Appeal was quash 'd , and so not depending , as the Defendant had pleaded . To the Second , It was prov 'd by the Prisoner 's own Hand-writing , that he had used to write his Name Lewis , as set forth in the Appeal . And further it appeared by the Records of the Court , that he had owned that Name , and had before pleaded , in two former Indictments , the same for Murder , and the other for Bigamy . And besides that he had usually answered to that Name . Thirdly , That as to the additional Title of Labourer , he had also pleaded to that Title or Addition , in two former Indictments . To this the Prisoner call 'd two Evidences , the one of which depos 'd , That he work 'd as a Journey-man or Servant , to our Mr. Fradden , and did not carry on the Trade as a Master . The other depos 'd , That he was bound Apprentice to him not long before last Christmas : By which is appear 'd he was now no other than a Servant and Labourer . Fourthly , As to that Article , That there were no such Persons in natura return , or now existing , as John Doe and Richard Roe , one Evidence depos 'd in Court , That there were two such Persons now existing , and living in Middlesex , the one a Weaver , the other a Soldier . Fifthly , To the fifth Issue , That Solomon Rondeau was not the true Appellant . Mrs. Rondean depos 'd , That she had no Children but Salomon Rondean , and Ann Rondeau , whom the prisoner had murdered ; And that Henry was but a Half Brother to the Deceased , he being by another Venter ; and that Solomon was Brother and Heir of the Deceased . Sixthly , As to the Plea , That the Appelles was not guilty of the Fact . To prove him guilty the following Evidences were produced . James Ainsworth , or Hensworth , depos 'd , That he was thirteen Years of Age , last Michaelmas ; and that last Winter , the Night that Ann Hussar was murdered , about or between seven or eight of the Clock , as he was standing near the End of Swan Alley in Shoreditch , the Prisoner came to him , and asked him , If he would go of an Errand ? That he reply 'd , Yes : That then he ask 'd him , If he knew one Mrs. Rondeau ? To which he reply 'd , No . That the Prisoner told him , he would show him the House ; and would give him a Penny to go thither , and tell Mrs. Rondeau that a Gentleman wanted to speak with her immediately , at the Black Dog Alehonse , in Bishopsgate street . That the Prisoner went with him into Swan Alley , within one Door of Mrs. Rondeau 's , and bid him go down the Steps , and ask for her , and do the Message . That he did so , and Mrs. Rondeau said , She would come presently . That when he came out of the House , the Prisoner seem 'd to be doing his Needs , and he gave him a Penny , and asked which Way she went , and he telling him towards the Street , he bid him go about his Business . Being interrogated by the Prisoner 's Counsel , How he could see him at that Time of Night , so as to know him again ? He reply 'd , That he saw him plainly by a Lamp , meaning , as he afterwards explain 'd it , a Glass light , or Lanthorn , hung up at a Butcher 's Stop , near the End of Swan Alley , where the Prisoner talk 'd with him : That he had on at that Time whitish Clothes . And being several Times interrogated about it , be constantly affirmed , He was the very Man that had sent him to Mrs. Rondeau 's House , that Night and Time the Murder was committed ; and that Mrs. Rondeau was the Woman that he did the Message to . And she likewise depos 'd , that he was the very Boy that did bring that Message to her . He added , That he knew him again in Newgate , and singled him out at the first Sight , from all the rest , without the least Hint or Intimations given him . Daniel Grenoe deposed , That when the Boy went to see the Prisoner in Newgate , he was led up by Mr. Reuse and another Man ; and , that he would not let any Body go up that knew the Prisoner , that they might not give him the least hint ; and , that there were 7 or 8 Persons in the Room . That the Boy , immediately upon seeing him , said , This is the Man . That the Prisoner said , Child , What do you mean ? You do n't know me . That he answered , you gave me a Penny to go to Swan Alley , and when I came out you were doing your Needs . That the Prisoner said , If I had known of your coming I would have been provided for you . Martha Bread and Wine deposed , That that Night the Murther was committed , as she was going for a Pail of Water , she saw a man between 7 and 8 Clock ; and also a Boy , and that the Boy stood looking in the Man 's Face , as if he was speaking to him . That this was about 6 Doors from the House of Mrs. Rondeau . That the Man was for Person and Stature exactly like the Prisoner ; and the Boy of the same Stature . She confirm 'd the former Evidence , that the Man had a whitish Coat on ; and , that she saw the Boy go down into Mrs. Rondeau 's House . Martha Rhubarb deposed , That she dwelling in Swan Yard , saw a Man walking to and fro about the Door Where she dwelt , to the best of her Knowledge about eight a Clock at Night : That she went in and came out again , and saw the same man standing between two Posts , over against the House where she dwelt , and afterwards saw him speaking to the Boy , saying , Which Way is she gone ? and the Boy made Answer , towards Shoreditch : And he had on a two-tail 'd Wig , a whitish Coat , and his Hat slapped over his Face . That the Man was of the same Stature , and Person with the Prisoner ; and the Boy of the same Size or Stature with James Ainsworth , the first Evidence . Margaret Pinet deposed , She also saw a Man in Swan Yard that Night , which ask 'd her what it was a Clock , and what Country Woman she was ; and was sure the Prisoner was the same man , and she knew him again in Newgate , and particularly by his Voice and his Clothes . Mrs. Rondeau deposed , That the Boy , the first Evidence , came to her , and told her a Gentleman wanted to speak with her at the Black Dog Alehouse , and it was the very Boy that stood by her in Court . That she went to the Black Dog in Shoreditch , and found no Person there that wanted to speak with her . That when she went out , she left her Daughter , Ann Rondeau , winding Silk by the Fire-side , and the Door on the Latch ; and when she return 'd , found the Door open , and her Daughter 's Throat cut to the very Neck-bone . Being ask 'd as to the Prisoner 's former Behaviour to his Wife , she answered , It was very bad , he had ruined her twice ; and having been arrested , he ran away to Holland , and left her to shift for her self ; and when he came back , pretending he had taken a House , he got her Goods in a Cart , and bidding her go one Way , while he want another , pretending to meet her , in Order to go and live together , he carried away the Goods , and sold them , and never came near her for a long Time afterwards . That he had given her Poison ( as for believes ) twice , which both Times caused her to vomit ; the first Time but little , telling her , It was Marlborough Stone ; but the second Time he gave her something be called Conserve of Roses , which she taking about six a Clock in the Evening , set her a writing for three Hours in the most violent Manner . That after the Vomiting was over , she lay motionless and sensless , so that she thought she had been dead , for several Hours after it , and that she was always complaining after that . Being asked concerning her Daughter 's Wound in the Throat , if it was haggled , or seem 'd to be done with a Sharp Instrument ? She reply 'd , It was but one Cut , and as if done with a sharp Instrument . Mrs. Walbridge depos 'd , that the Prisoner had a Room in her House in Swan-Alley in Coleman-street , that he came to her House as near as she could guess between 7 and 8 a Clock at Night , and desir 'd a Candle , and went up Stairs to his Room , and having dress 'd himself came down in about a Quarter of an Hour , and when he came down , he had on a whitish Coat under a great Coat , and also a Sword and Cane , and that the great Coat was never heard of afterwards . That after he was taken up he sent to her , and she fetch 'd a Man to him , he being then in the condemned Hold ; and he sent them to pawn a Suit of Clothes , which they did , and gave him 2 Guineas , one of which she changed into Silver ; and that when the Man was gone , he desir 'd her not to say that he was at her House the Night the Fact was committed . That she went to him another Time , and said to him , Mr. Hussar , I wish you had been sick in your Bed when this happened , because it has caus 'd so much Trouble to you , and every Body . That he reply 'd , he was not sorry for it ; for if it had not happened now , it would have happened at another Time . And this was after he had had his first Trial . Mary Hill depos 'd , that she liv 'd with the former Evidence , and deposed to the same Purpose ; adding ; that both the under Coat and great Coat were whitish ; that as she thinks he came there between 6 and 7 , and staid there about a Quarter of an Hour . Claudius Praddin depos 'd , that the Prisoner , some considerable Time before the Murther was committed , ask 'd leave of him to let him have the Use of his Shop , to make a Whig or two in , which he gave him ; and in the way of Discourse , he asked him how he could give himself those Airs as he did , in pretending to court young Women , when he had a Wife already . That he reply 'd , she signified nothing . That if he found one he lik 'd be could prosecute her , and she could be burnt for her Religion , for she was a Socinian , and it was no more Sin to kill her , than to kill a Dog . Mrs. Sprags depos 'd , she dwelt in Bishopsgate street near the Work-house , and that Elizabeth Hern his present Wife , being her Acquaintance , came to pay her a Visit the Night the Murther was committed , and her Apprentice came with her , and that after they had been there sometime and supp 'd , she having given the Apprentice a Plate of Victuals , he had just eaten it up , when the Prisoner came to her House . That it was then betwixt 8 and 9 a Clock , by this Token , that the Maid came and ask 'd her , if she might not shut up the Shop , for her Neighbour had , and it was past 8 a Clock . That as the Prisoner was sitting musing and melancholy , she took notice of it , and said to him , You seem to be uneasy ; and that soon after , he catched up his Cane which stood by him , and started up in a sort of Surprize , which was so visible , that she desir 'd to know the Reason of it . To which he reply 'd , he was much Surpris 'd , left Mr. Sprags her Husband should come in , and see him in that Pickle . To which she made answer , he was very well ; And told the Court that he then was dress 'd as well , and she thought better , than when she had seen him before . Charles Cotterel depos 'd , that he having some Acquaintance with the Prisoner , they having been Neighbours , went to see him in Newgate : He sent for him by a Porter twice , about 3 Sessions ago , and treated with him concerning being an Evidence for him , and desired him to swear that he was drinking with him in an Alehouse in Newgate-street , at the Time when the Murther was committed . That the Prisoner owned to him , that he had given a Boy a Penny to call her Mother out , and had indeed given her a Touch with his Razor , not thinking of killing her . And that he sent to him another time , and then promised him , if he would be an Evidence for him as before proposed , he would give him a new Suit of Clothes , a new Shirt , and 20 Guineas , and that this was the Day before the Sessions began . That he objecting against doing it , the Prisoner reply 'd , there was no more Harm in taking a false Oath , than in common Cursing and Swearing . This being the Sum of the Evidence for the King , the Prisoner in his Defence call 'd the following Evidences . Edward Satchwel depos 'd , that he met the Prisoner about half an Hour after 6 a Clock the Evening that the Murther was commited , and said he was going to Grey Friars , and he saw him about 7 a Clock , and left him about half an Hour after 7. Mary Hern depos 'd , that the Prisoner came to her Mother 's House , in Prince 's Court in Lothbury , between 7 and 8 a Clock , to see if her Mother was gone , and her Sister ask 'd him to stay , but the Maid said to him , Mr. Hussar , you do n't consider what a Clock it is ; he ask 'd her what a Clock , and she reply 'd between 7 and 8. William Bradley depos 'd that on the 26th of February , he saw the Prisoner about 7 a Clock just by the Exchange . The Prisoner desir 'd this Evidence to be ask 'd if he did not ask him then to give him a Pint of Wine for Socket Money . He answer 'd it was the Drawer at the Vine Tavern that did . He call 'd also Francis Pike , who was his new Wife 's , Mrs. Hern 's Apprentice , what Time it was when he came to Mrs. Sprag 's . He reply 'd , it was betwixt 8 and 9. Elizabeth How depos 'd , that Charles Cotterel , the Evidence before mentioned , was a sorry drunken Fellow , and she had heard him in several Tales concerning Mr. Hussar , as that he had given him half a Guinea to go to a House , and offered him 10 Guineas . and 20 Guineas , and the Like . The Prisoner call 'd some Persons to his Reputation . The Prisoner was out of Temper with some of his Evidences , and would persuade them they depos 'd more to his Advantage at his former Tryal ; but his Displeasure had no influence on them to say what he would have them , nor could his Counsel , nor Solicitor , give him Satisfaction , as to the Management of his Cause . Neither did he behave himself , at the Bar , with that Temper and Humility it became him . However , after the Evidence had been impartially summoned up , the Jury went out , and after a short Stay , brought their Verdict in as follows . As to the Questions . 1 . Being ask 'd , if the Prisoner 's Name was Lewis , Whether they found for the Appellant or Appellee ? they found for the Appellant . 2 . As to the Addition of Labourer ? they answer 'd , they found for the Appellant . 3 . If there were such Persons , as John Doe and Richard Roe ? they answer 'd , they found for the Appellant . 4 . As to Solomon Rondeau 's being the true Heir of the Deceased ? they answer 'd , they found for the Appellant . 5 . Whether the Prisoner was guilty of the Murther laid to his Charge , or not ? they answer 'd , Guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] Robert Fitz Simonds was indicted for the Murther of Charles Middleton , by giving him one mortal Bruise on the left side near the Crown of the Head , on the 26th of September last , of which he languished till the 6th of October , and then died . He was indicted a second time , upon the Coroner 's Inquest , Mr. Cooling depos 'd , That he invited Mr. Fitz Simonds to drink , in a Part of the Fleet-Prison , call 'd The Yorkshire House ; and that there was with him Mr. Maclean , who also press 'd Mr. Fitz . Simonds to drink as well as he , and that Mr. Middleton came up when they had drank one Pot . That Maclean propos 'd a Health , ( God 's King , God 's Church , and God 's People . ) Upon which Mr. Fitz Simonds desir 'd him to explain himself , and because he did not , he threw the Mug of drink at him , and thereupon a Scuffle ensued between the Prisoner and Mr. Maclean , and they were both down on the Bed , but he saw no Blow given to Middleton , but that he went to part them . William Maclean depos 'd , that Mr. Cooling and himself did invite Capt . Fitz Simonds to drink , but he refused till they pressed him , and he promised to treat him , that he did propose this Health , God Almighty 's King , God Almighty 's Church , and God bless us all . That the Prisoner said , why do you not name King George . That Mr. Cooling set the Mug down on the Table , and the Prisoner call 'd him ( this Evidence ) Jacobite Rogue , and took the Mug and threw the Drink in his Face : That he wip 'd his Eyes with his Fingers , and thinks he might say to the Prisoner he would not take it . That thereupon the Prisoner clos 'd with him , and ran him down on the Bed , and they were parted , and the Prisoner took up a Chair , but he saw no Blow given with it , and they were fallen on the Bed again , and when they got up , Middleton had had a Blow , and said , Let who would part them he would not , for he had gotten a broken Head , but did not say who gave it . Henry Raynes depos 'd , that the Prisoner , and Cooking , and Maclean , were drinking in his Room , and Middleton came in when they had drank one Bottle . That Maclean proposing the foresaid Health , and refusing to name King George , the Prisoner threw the Drink in his Face , and so the Quarrel began . That he saw nothing of any Blow given with a Chair : But while the Prisoner and Maclean were scuffling on the Bed , the Prisoner being undermost , the Deceased ( Middleton ) being near the Side of the Bed fell down , and hit the left Side of his Head against the Edge of a Bench , he took him up , and wash 'd it with Brandy , for it bled . That they stay 'd some Time afterwards , and were reconciled ; and the Prisoner expostulating , with Maclean , why he would not explain himself , he call 'd for Brandy , and did drink King George 's Health : That they went away together , and that Middleton stay 'd after them . That he did not see any Chair in the Prisoner 's Hand , but he said he was sorry for Middleton 's being hurt ; and Maclean also depos 'd the same , adding , that the Prisoner said he did not intend it for him . Raynes added , that some Time before , the Deceased complained to him of his not being well . Mrs. Middleton depos 'd , That her Husband said he had received a Blow from Mr. Fitz . Simonds , but it was not designed for him . The Surgeon depos 'd , He did believe that the Bruise on his Head , was the Cause of his Death . The Prisoner in his Defence gave the same Account of the Occasion of their Meeting and Quarrel that the other Evidences had done , saving that upon his urging Maclean to explain himself , whether by God 's King he meant King George , that Maclean should reply , He was the Devil 's King ; and Cooling being call 'd as to that , said , Maclean said , If he is not God 's King , he is the Devil 's King . The Prisoner pleaded , That he told the Evidence Maclean , that he having the Honour to bear the King 's Commission , would not bear to hear such Expressions ; and if he would not explain himself , and drink King George 's Health ; he should go out of the Company . That he took up no Chair , nor did strike the Deceased , and that while they were down on the Bed , Maclean being uppermost , having gotten his Finger in his Month , and bit it half off , they getting up found the Deceased had received a Hurt , but he knew not how it came . It appear 'd by all the Evidences , That there was the utmost Friendship between the Prisoner , Deceased , and all the rest of the Company , till the unhappy Dispute arose , and that before they parted they were reconciled . That the Deceased did not charge the Prisoner with giving him the Blow ; nor did any of them say , that they saw any Blow given by the Prisoner to the Deceased ; and by the Evidence of Raynes it appear 'd to have been rather the Effect of his Fall against the Bench . The Prisoner call 'd some to his Reputation , who gave him the Character of a peaceable , inoffensive Person , and upon a full Hearing of the Matter , the Jury acquitted him of both Indictments . Michael Cannon , William Perkins , John Heath . The three last Convicts former Session N.B .
