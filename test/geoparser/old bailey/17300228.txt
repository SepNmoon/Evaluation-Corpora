Jane Pointers depos 'd , That the Prisoner had confess 'd that she took the Watch out of the Drawer , and wrapped it in a Sheet of white Paper ; and that she had broken it , and thrown it into the Common Sewer ; and afterwards that she had thrown it down the House of Office , but that at first she said she had sold it , where her Sister had before pawned some Things . But enquiry being made in the several places she had spoken of , none of them knew anything of it ; she added , that the Prisoner was taken into the House to wait upon a Child . Anne Crywater depos 'd , That the Prisoner was taken into the House several times to do Work , and was left all alone in the Dining-Room , and that her Mistress said she had put the Watch into the Drawer ; and that in discourse she had heard her say , she had not seen the Watch for a Week . That the Prisoner came to Mr. Piver 's House on Saturday Night after the Watch had been missing , and they bid her not be out of the way ; that thereupon she came again on Sunday Night , and that they charged her very strictly with having taken the Watch , telling her , that if she did not tell where the Watch was , they would hang her ; but if she would discover what she had done with it , if she had sold or pawn 'd it , he would redeem it , and forgive her . That thereupon , though she had before deny 'd that she knew any thing of it , she owned she had taken it , and thrown it into the Common Sewer , and sometimes she said she had burnt it ; that she varying thus in her Story , he said to her , you know what you say , what have you done with it ?

The Prosecutor 's Nurse depos 'd , That she saw her Mistress put the Watch into the Drawer a Week before , and the Drawer had been Lock 'd till the Day the Girl was in the Room , but that Day it stood unlock 'd . There being no Evidence of the Prisoner 's having the Watch , but her own Confession , which was so inconsistent , and seeming to proceed from the fright she was in , upon being charged with the Watch ; and she being a young Girl of about 12 or 13 Years of Age , and of an honest Character , the Jury acquitted her .

There were other Evidences to confirm this , and that the Rings were found by the Prisoner 's Direction , where they had been pawn 'd by her . The Prisoner did not deny her having pawned the Rings ; but pleaded , that the Glass of the Scriptore was broken by Accident , by the Fall of a Curtain Rod ; that the Board of the Scriptore behind the Glass was not broken , and that the Prosecutor 's Daughter , Anne Whiting , gave her the Key of the Scriptore , and bid her take the Rings , and make use of them on Account of Money she ow 'd to the Prisoner , she having no other way to pay her . It did appear by other Evidences , that there had been a very great Intimacy between the Prosecutor 's Daughter and the Prisoner ; but the Prosecutor 's Daughter charged the Balance of Accounts upon the Prisoner . The Prisoner desir 'd the Prosecutor might be ask 'd . If she was not married to her Son ? But the Prosecutor said , her Son deny 'd it ; she reply 'd , that she could produce her Certificate , and that when she was before a Justice , and her Mittinens was made in the Name of Dorothy Tod , she then said , that was not her Name , her Name was Whiting ; this was confirm 'd by the Constable .
