Elizabeth Griffith being ask 'd , how far she was from the Prisoner and Deceas 'd ? reply 'd , she was about 2 or 3 Yards off , and had there been 5 or 6 Blows struck as Bell had sworn , she must have seen it ; but positively depos 'd , she saw no blow struck by the Deceas 'd . The Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found him guilty of both Indictments . Death . Richard Cooper , of St. Catharine Creed-Church , was indicted for the Murther of Margaret Harle , alias Hall , by giving her one mortal Wound with a Pistol and leaden Bullet upon the right part of the Back , of the Depth of five Inches , of which she instantly died , the 16th of April last . He was likewise indicted a second time on the Coroner 's Inquest for the same . Mr. Day , the Master , depos 'd , That about half an Hour after Three o'Clock , he heard the report of a Pistol , and immediately the Maid cried out , and came into the Shop stooping almost double , holding her Hands at her Back , saying , O Lord , Dick has killed me , I am shot , I am shot , and fell down ; that the Neighbours coming in , they got her up , setting her in a Chair , attempting to give her a Cordial , and sent immediately for a Surgeon . That he went into the Kitchin , and found the Prisoner sitting at the End of a Table , and saying to him , have you kill 'd the Maid ? But he made no answer . Did you fire the Pistol ? He reply 'd , I did shoot ; and putting his Hand in his Pocket , gave him the Pistol . That he ask 'd the Occasion of his doing it , but he gave no answer ; and that the Maid did not live above 10 Minutes . This Evidence being ask 'd , if there had before been any Quarrel between them ? He reply 'd , some Words might have pass 'd , but he had heard that he had kick 'd her once or twice two or three Months before . Joseph Wild depos 'd , That he going to Mr. Day 's Shop , help 'd to lift the Deceas 'd up , and afterwards went into the Kitchin , and telling the Prisoner he had kill 'd the Maid , he reply 'd , he could not help it ; and asking him , has there been any Quarrel betwixt you ? He reply 'd , she made Mischief in the Family . Alexander Wood depos 'd , That the Wound was near the Kidneys , and that probing the Wound , could find no Ball . That the Prisoner had kick 'd the Deceas 'd 3 Months before , and that he was present in the Kitchin when they had had some Words , and the Prisoner said to the Deceas 'd , you know my Temper , why do you provoke me ? That the Deceas 'd answer 'd , must I be subject to your Humour ? That she complain 'd he had cut her with a Knife cross the Arm ; that the Prisoner said , he did it accidentally ; but the Deceas 'd said , he did it wilfully . That at another time they had some Words , he using to clean the Knives , found fault that she always took a clean Knife to eat her Dinner , upon which the Prisoner said , she must be taken down . This Evidence being ask 'd concerning the Pistol , said , the Prisoner had had it several Years , and us 'd to carry it when he went to Highgate and Hampstead , when he liv 'd with Mr. Thornton . Sarah Harle depos 'd , That the Deceas 'd , her Sister , had complain 'd to her , that Richard had beat her several times , and that he was a very subtil Fellow , and that she had given him 6 d. to make him good humour 'd , and at another time 18 d. for carrying 2 Boxes for her on the same Account . Sarah Dixon depos 'd , That about 6 Weeks before there had been some Words about the making some Water-Gruel , the Deceas 'd saying she was busy , bidding him do it himself ; that Mr. Day saying , did he thus reward the Deceas 'd for nursing him two Weeks ? That the Prisoner D - n 'd her for a Bitch , and said , he would give her nothing . The Surgeon depos 'd , That the Wound was Mortal . The Prisoner , in his Defence , pleaded , That he had been out of Order at Times in his Head and Mind , and would insinuate as if he had charg 'd the Pistol to have shot himself ; and that he had a Day or two before ask 'd the Apprentice for Landanum for that Purpose ; upon which Mr. Day being interrogated , said , the Prisoner had indeed been cut of Order , as he apprehended , from a Cold , and he had given him Things proper , but he perceiv 'd no Disorder in his Mind or Head , or any Signs of Lunacy the Day he committed the Fact , and that he did his Business as usual . The Apprentice own 'd he had ask 'd him for 5 Grains of Opium , that he thereupon said to him , have you a Mind to kill your self ; but did not apprehend that he had any such Design , and that he said he wanted something to make him Sleep . John Humphreys depos 'd , That about 12 or 14 Years since , when he liv 'd in Henrietta-street , he had attempted to drown himself , and was taken out of the Thames . Jane Saunders and Mary Ray depos 'd , That about two Months since , he had told them , he had been Light-headed , and that they thought he look 'd Melancholy . After a full hearing of the Matter , the Jury found him guilty of the Indictment . Death . Ambrose Newport , of Thistleworth , was indicted for feloniously stealing a black brown Mare , value 6 l. the Property of Charles Clinch , the 26th of April last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That he lost his Mare at Fairforth in Gloucestershire , and found it again at Thistleworth . Thomas Barrat depos 'd , That the Prisoner offer 'd the Mare to Sale between Hounslow and Brentford , and a Friend of his had agreed to give him two Guineas and half a Crown for it at the Artichoke in Brentford , but he did not pay the Money , but order 'd the Mare to be set up in the Stable , he suspecting it to be stolen ; that the Prisoner went away , and sent from an Ale-house in the Town for the Mare , pretending he had repented his Bargain ; but he refus 'd to deliver the Mare , and caus 'd him to be apprehended . The Prisoner pleaded , That he being on the Road , a Man rode upon the Mare , who ask 'd him , if he would ride ? That he accepted his Offer , being weary ; that the Man bid him ride to a certain Place , and he would meet him there ; that he having staid at the Place a considerable time , and the Man not coming for the Mare , he made use of her to carry him farther . This Pretence did not avail , but the Jury found him guilty of the Indictment . Death . John Peaverly , of St. George Hanover-square , was indicted for feloniously stealing a Purse , value 2 d. and 48 Guineas , in the Dwelling-House of Robert Dickenson , the 25th of April last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That the Prisoner ( a Lad of about 12 Years of Age ) was employ 'd by him to go of Errands , and look after his Shop ; that he went out at about 11 o'Clock , left the Prisoner in the Parlour , and returning between 2 and 3 , found his Parlour and Shop Door open , and the Till broken open , and his Money was gone ; that going in Quest of the Prisoner , he apprehended him , and found the Money upon him , except one Guinea he had chang 'd . John Cotterel depos 'd , That he apprehended the Prisoner , and he own 'd he had Robb 'd his Master , and had 14 s. 6 d. of the Guinea he had chang 'd , and 3 Half-pence left , and own 'd that he had broken open the Door with an Adz . Death . Richard Trapp , alias Blue Dick , of Paddington , was indicted for assaulting John Monk on the Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him 2 Cloth Coats , value 30 s. a Wastcoat , a pair of Boots and Spurs , a Guinea , a half Guinea , and 12 s. in Money , the 19th of March last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , that he being near Paddington , about Nine o'Clock at Night , the day laid in the Indictment , he was met by the Prisoner at the Bar and another , that he caught hold of his Horse 's Bridle , and snapp 'd a Pistol at him , but it did not go off ; that he ask 'd , what they wanted ? They said , Money ; to which he reply 'd , they should have what he had . That they ask 'd for his Watch , and then took him by the Collar , he being dismounted , and then telling him he must go along with him , led him into a Field , took his Coat , Wastcoat , Hat , Money , & c. and run the muzzle of his Pistol into his Eye , and almost blinded him ; that they stripp 'd him of his Clothes , and abus 'd him very much ; that they having left him , he got to a Friend 's House at Paddington , and they put him to Bed . That Humphreys , the Accomplice , asking , if the Horse was his own ? the Prisoner said , it was not his own Horse , but one he had borrow 'd . The Prosecutor being ask 'd , if he was sure the Prisoner was the Person ? He reply 'd , yes ; that he was a considerable time with them , and it was so Light that he could distinguish , and he had known the Prisoner several Years , he using sometimes to Work at Harrow on the Hill at Harvest-work , and had drank in his Company . John Humphreys depos 'd , That the Prisoner came to him , and he gave him leave to lodge at his House , and he ask 'd me to go with him to his Mother-in-law 's House at Harrow on the Hill , and they carried down Fish and Parsnips , this was on Thursday , and they came back to London the next Day on Friday , and they met the Prosecutor and robb 'd him as he has before depos 'd , and afterwards bid himlend him his Knife , that he ( this Evidence ) said , if you take his Money , you shall not Murder him . That the Prosecutor desir 'd him to let him have some of his Clothes to cover him , and the Prisoner d - n 'd him , and said , I will cover you , and fell to laying of him on very barbarously , and he got him into his Arms , and took him away from him ; that the Prisoner bid him , this Evidence , go higher on the Road , and stay till he came to him ; that he did , and waited till about 12 or 1 o'Clock , and lay down to sleep till he came to him . The Prisoner deny 'd the Fact , and call 'd the following Evidences to prove that he was at Home at his Mother-in-law 's House in Roxith in Harrow Parish all that Night that Mr. Monk was robb 'd . Thomas Dell depos 'd , That he saw the Prisoner at Roxith that Day at about 6 o'the Clock in the Evening , that he stood talking with him a quarter of an Hour over the Pales . Mary Priest depos 'd , The Prisoner lay that Night the young Man was robb 'd , where she lodg 'd at Roxith . Mary Turner depos 'd , The Prisoner came Home that Friday between 7 and 8 o'Clock at Night , and went to Bed with his Wife . Mary Saltenstal depos 'd the same the former Evidence had done . And that John Humphreys call 'd him up by 5 o'the Clock next Morning to go to London , that she made a Fire about 9 a Clock at Night , and he sat up by the Fire , and leaned his Head against the Oven 's Mouth , and she lock 'd him in , and left him asleep there . Mary Streke depos 'd , That she saw the Prisoner talking to Thomas Dell about 6 o'Clock , and John Humphreys sat at a Tree a little distance , and Trapp went down the Lane to go Home , and Humphreys followed him . In Contradiction to these Evidences . Richard Burch depos 'd , That he saw Blue-Dick , the Prisoner , much about 7 o'Clock that Friday Night that Mr. Monk was robb 'd , go by his House at Stone-bridge , about 5 miles from the Place where the Robbery was committed . Jeffery Burch depos 'd , That he saw the Prisoner and Humphreys lying near Mary le Bone , as if they were asleep , and going to the Rose and Crown in Paddington , and having heard that Mr. Monk had been robb 'd , he suspected they had been concern 'd in it , and told some Persons where they might go and find them under a heap of Straw . The Fact being fully prov 'd to the Satisfaction of the Jury , they found him guilty of the Indictment . Death . John Bentley , James Owen , and Hannah Owen of St. Bartholomew 's Exchange , were indicted for feloniously stealing a Bank Note , value 100 l. the Property of Thomas Butler , the 4th of February last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That on the 3d of February he went out to Dinner ; and the Prisoner ask 'd him leave to go Abroad ; that the 4th of February he found his Scriptore open , and the Note was missing ; that he went to the Bank , and on the 6th had word brought him from the Bank that it had been receiv 'd by one Smith . Samuel Smith depos 'd , That on Friday Morning John Bentley and Robinson came to him , and they going to Drink , the Prisoner told them he had found a Note wrapp 'd up in 4 Sheets of Paper , near Temple-Bar , saying , as he had found it , he had a Property in it , it was his right , that He and William Gilling went and inquir 'd if it had been advertis 'd , or if any Stop had been put to the Payment of it , and finding that there was not , they went and receiv 'd the Money at the Bank , and went back to the Fountain Ale -house , where the Prisoner waited , and told him , they could get the Money , if he would allow 10 Guineas for the discount of it ; that he agreed to it , and bid them go get the Money ; that they went away , and came again , and said , they had got it , and the Prisoner said it was a merry Day , and they went to the Queens-Arms Tavern in Newgate-Street . William Gilling depos 'd , That on Friday about 11 o'the Clock , Smith came to him to the Swan Alehouse , and desired him to go with him , and that he did go and receive the Money ; that Robinson and the Prisoner were there , and his Dray stood in the Street ; that he desir 'd the Prisoner to let him see the 4 Sheets of Paper he said it was wrapp 'd up in , and he pull 'd a Paper out of his Pocket , and he observ 'd to him that there was no Dirt upon it ; to which the Prisoner made Answer , that the outward Paper was Dirty ; that he gave Robinson 4 Guineas , and Smith gave him , this Evidence , 5 Guineas . Henry Robinson depos 'd , that the Prisoner Bentley came to him , ask 'd to go to Drink , told him , he had found a Bank Note , and offered to give half a Guinea to go to receive it ; but he refusing to be concerned in it , he said , he would go to Major Smith , that he did , and he and Gilling receiv 'd the Money , and brought it to him , as has been before depos 'd ; that he gave Smith 6 Guineas , and the other 4 , and half a Guinea to him ( this Evidence ) to buy a Dinner , and he went and bought Fowls , and he also lent him 5 Guineas . Mr. Martin depos 'd , That he went to the Poultry Compter , and examining the Prisoner Owen , and pressing him to confess , he did at last confess that he had taken it , and fell down on his Knees and begg 'd that his Master would forgive him ; and asking him , what was done with the Note ? He said , Bentley had discounted it . Mr. Nash depos 'd , that he was with Mr. Martin , and heard the Prisoner Owen confess the taking of the Note ; and that Owen inquir 'd if Bentley was taken , and said , that he could not tell how the Money might be got , and that Bentley could swear enough to Hang him . Martha Archbeul depos 'd , that Bentley owned to her , that when he absconded , and went to Shields , he took one Hannah Rogers , another Man 's Wife , with him , and had spent above 40 l. upon her in 3 Weeks Time . Anne Simcock depos 'd , That she is Servant to the Prosecutor , and that her Master went out between 10 and 11 o'Clock , and her Mistress about one ; that Mr. Butler had given James Owen leave to go Abroad to take his Pleasure , and that he did not go by 2 or 3 Hours to soon as he might , but trifled about till her Mistress was gone out , and then went up under pretence to make up the Fire , and set the Room to rights ; she wond'ring he made no more haste to go out , took Notice that he was in the Closet , where the Scriptore stood , where he had no Business , and when she went up , expecting after his long stay she should find the Room in good Order , but she found he had done nothing to it , but every thing was out of Order . Bentley pleaded , that Owen had several times apply 'd to him to take an Alehouse for him , and they had treated about a House at Cow-Cross ; and he telling that Money would be wanting to carry on such an Affair , Owen said , his Wife had a Friend would lend her Money , and that when she brought the Note to him , he said , it had been lent her by a Friend . There were other Evidences , but their Depositions being not very material , and the Fact as to stealing the Note being fully prov 'd upon James Owen , the Jury found him guilty of the Indictment . Death . But there being no Evidence against Hannah Owen , she was acquitted . As likewise was John Bently , there wanting Proof that he acted in the stealing the Note , but he was order 'd by the Court to be continu 'd in Custody , in order to be indicted again the next Sessions as an Accessory after the Fact in receiving it , knowing it to have been stolen .

Price stitch 'd 2 s. bound 2 s. 6 d . An ADDRESS to the GENTLEMEN , By Dr. GREGORIUS , ( Noted for his Skill in Surgery and Anatomy , as well as Physick and Chymistry . ) WHO having observ 'd the frequent Advertisements in the News Papers , of one and another single Medicine , said to cure all sorts of Gleets , and Seminal Weaknesses , which their Authors confound together , as if there were no Difference between them , has been prevail 'd upon , by his Friends , in this publick Manner , to inform , and undeceive those who have unwarily been brought into either , ( or both together , as it sometimes happens ) of these perplexing , draining Imbecilities . That where the Gleeting is only from a Laxity of the Glands in the Urethra , what leaks and drills away insensibly from them , through the Urinary Passage , and spots or smears the Linen , though it be yellowish , yet being without Pain , or any ill-condition 'd Disorder , is no more than Mucus , and must be cured one Way . And where it is a Seminal Weakness , that which slips away involuntarily , though it be thin , watery , and unelaborate , either by itself , in the Day-time , or a Nights too frequently , or profusely in the Sleep , or with the Urine , or upon Stool , whether from an Acrimony , or Depravity of the Juices , or by over-straining the Spermatick Vessels , or both , is Seed , and is to be remedied another way , inasmuch , as that Medicine which will cure the one , will not cure the other , and ( vice versa ) as every Practitioner that knows the Nature , Make , and different Situation of the Parts ministring to Generation , will allow ; and that for want of this due Distinction , and right Application , it is , that so many People are disappointed of Cure ; and by continuance of the Gleetings , are drain 'd , as they are , into Impotencies , or Infertilities , which as it hinders their marrying , gives 'em great Anxiety , and the more , when attended , as in some , with Pain and Weakness in the Back and Reins ; or , as in others , with Difficulty , or Dribblings of the Urine in , or after making it , which at length comes away either foul , sharp , slimy , or of an ill Smell . As this is so in Fact , and the Dr. Well known to have experienc 'd , in numberless Instances , the noble and never-failing Effects of two particular Balsamick Electuaries , which he spared no Pains or Expence to find out , the one to restrain the Mucus , and the other the involuntary shedding of the Seed , by their respectively bracing up the Fibres , and restoring the Tone and Springiness of the relaxed Glands and Seminals , invigorating the Genitals , and fertilizing the Seed , was also perswaded to recommend their Use , that those , who , for a long while together , had tried other Medicines for the same Weaknesses , and by their not succeeding , concluding themselves incurable , might be convinc 'd by their speedy Amendment and Recovery by these , that it was not the Incurability of their Malady , but the wrong Method they had been in for Cure . But yet in either of the said two Weaknesses , or where it happens that they are complicated , and have proceeded , either from Self-abuses , excessive , or over-straining Coitions , or from over Purgations in Venereal Cures , or any other Cause , as a Flux of Humours generally falls down and settles upon all weake ned Parts , rendring them still the weaker , and these tender nervous Parts more especially : The first Step to be taken in order to make way for a regular and substantial Cure , ( and without which it is not to be accomplished ) must , in a peculiar Manner , be to correct , and gently divert those Humours ; and the only Medicine he could ever rely upon to do this effectually , that is , to overcome the Cause , and introduce the Cure of the most difficult of these Weaknesses , ( even where the Vessels had been obstructed , Manhood greatly enseebled , and in some , well high extinct , or at least not able to touch a Woman , but ad primum labiorum contactum , semen emittunt ; ) has been his Preparing Pills , of which when the Patient has taken only three Doses , at due Distances , he is to begin ( and not before ) with one or t'other ( or both together , as the Case may chance to be ) of the said two Electuaries , which how to distinguish in , and how to proceed with , the printed Directions , wrap 'd up with the Pills , do so plainly shew , that no Persons , even of the meanest Capacities , can be at any Loss to understand them ; but will by their observing the easy Rules therein laid down , have their Blood and whole Body well cleans 'd and purified , the debilated Parts strengthened , and by Degrees , compleatly , and lastingly invigorated and restored , so as to be enabled quickly , and safely to Marry , without the least Need of any further , or other Advice or Medicine . They are to be had , Price 7 s. 6 d. the Box , sealed up , ready to be delivered to any Messenger , upon only asking for , a Box of Pills , at Mr. Payne 's , a Bookseller , at the Crown , facing the Chapter Coffee-House , in Pater noster-Row .
