But as I was walking along Shoe Lane , I fell into Company with the Prisoner , and she invited me to take a Lodging with her . And so she led me up Stairs into her Room , and we sat down upon the Bed together ; I staid with her 2 or 3 Hours , and no body came near us , but the good Woman of the House , when she brought the Liquor we call 'd for . I think I spent about 5 or 6 Shillings in Drams , which I paid for as they come in , the 4 Guineas were wrapt in a piece of Paper , I took them out with my other Money , and put them up again into my Fob , but I had not been long upon the Bed with her , before I mist'em .

I live at the Sign of the Last , the corner of New Inn Yard by Holywell Dunghill , and hearing a noise upon the Hill , I went out to see what was the matter . I found several People there , and among them the 2 Prisoners , and 3 other Soldiers . One of the Soldier s whose name is William Newsham , was in a quarrel with a Baker . The Soldiers took Newsham 's part , and the other People stood up for the Baker . I advis 'd them not to fall out , but to agree and be Friends ; And I was in hopes they would have taken that advice , for the Prisoner Jones was going away , but Bullock another of the Soldiers , came up to the Baker , and said , Sirrah you are a Scoundrel , and he shall thrash you , and so the Baker and Newsham , fell to fighting . The Baker was too hard for Newsham , which the Soldiers perceiving , one of them help 'd up Newsham when he was down . The Deceas 'd standing by said , that that was not fair play , upon which the Prisoner Jones , knock 'd him down , and then struck at me , which my Son seeing be Collar 'd Jones , and in strugling they tumbled one another down the side of and the Deceas 'd went after them . Most of the Soldier 's Arms , and some of their Cloths , lay on a heap together ; The Prisoner Peircy went to that heap . and took out a Sword or a Bayonet . I am not certain which , and ran down the Hill after the rest . John Smith Junor depos 'd to the same effect , and thus added . While I was strugling with Jones at the bottom of the Hill , Peircy came down and struck me with his Stick .

Elizabeth Clark thus depos 'd . - Jones knock 'd down the Deceas 'd , - young Smith and Jones tumbled down the Hill together , the Deceas 'd went after them , and the Prisoner Piercy follow 'd the Deceas 'd and knock 'd him down , and as he was rising again , before he was quite up , I saw Peircy Stab him in the Body with a Bayonet , I think they call it by that Name . - it was shorter and broader than a Sword . - The Deceas 'd fell on his Face , and at the same time Smith had hold of the other Prisoner Jones . Darby Queen ( a Boy ) thus depos 'd . - Peircy went to the Cloths , took up the Bayonet , or a Sword , ( I dont very well know one from the other , ) and he had a Stick in his Hand besides . He run down the Hill , and knock 'd down the Deceas 'd , - not quite flat upon the Ground , but within a little of it ; And as he was rising again , with his Arms stretch 'd out in this Posture , - Peircy stuck the Bayonet into his Body ; and then Peircy setting his Back against a Bank , waved his Sword ( or Bayonet ) about to keep the People off - I saw nothing in the Deceas 'd Hand , when Peircy kill 'd him . Robert French thus depos 'd : - I saw both the Prisoners with their Arms . - My Back was turn 'd when the Stab was given , but I and Smith immediately seiz 'd the Prisoner Peircy , with the Bayonet in his Hand , which with some difficulty we wrested from him .

That the Wound was between the second and third Rib , that he prob 'd it 5 Inches deep , that he believed it was given with some such Weapon as a Bayonet , and that it was Mortal . Peircy then made his Defence , While I was a top of the Hill , I heard that Jones was in danger of being Murder 'd , and running down to his Assistance , met a Man with a Bayonet , with which he made a Pass at me . I knock 'd it out of his Hand , and just at that time , Smith and French laid hold of me - Thus Peircy . Then Jones . When the Man was kill 'd I was closely engaged with Smith , and had my Sword and Stick in my Hand . John Cawary depos 'd . That he saw Peircy soon after he was seiz 'd , and he had then no Weapon in his Hand . Ann Cawdry thus depos 'd . I heard that Newsham ( who is my Brother ) was fighting with a Baker , upon which I went to them , got betwixt them , and made an end of their Quarrel , and while they were putting on their Cloths , I heard that a Soldier was almost Murder 'd , and going towards , the Place , I met a Man in brown Cloths , with a Bayonet in his Hand . I stop 'd him , and ask 'd him now he came by it , he made no answer , but left it with me and run away . I saw Peircy presently after he was seiz 'd , and then he had no Weapon in his Hand . Col. Rialey gave the Prisoners the Character of Civil , quite honest Men . The Jury Acquitted Jones , and found Peircy Guilty . Death .

Patridge excus 'd himself by telling the Company , that Harrington first divulged the Secret and that what he said was only to be even with him . Upon this they seem 'd to be pretty well reconcild . We had agreed before hand , that I should pass for Mark Partridge , Husband , to prevent my being too far attack 'd by any of the Company .

They talk 'd all manner of the and most vile Obscenity in her Presence , and she appear 'd wonderfully pleas 'd with it . Joseph Sellers depos 'd to the same Purpose and added he believ 'd there were above 40 Sodomies commited that Night . The Prisoner in her Defence , said that Darwin was taken up only for a Quarrel and that it ought to be considered , that she was a Woman , and therefore it could not be thought that she would ever be concern 'd in such abonsinable Practices .
