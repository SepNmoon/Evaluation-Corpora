In this Posture this Evidence left them , and ran down to call up his Fellow-Servants ; and returning with them , they found both the Gentlemen fallen down , the Deceased being undermost . They took them both up . The Prisoner kill 'd the Deceased , and called him his Dear Merrick . And turning to this Evidence , For God 's Sake , says he , run for a Surgeon , which he did immediately ; but returning without the Surgeon , who staid to prepare some Necessaries , the Prisoner , with great Impatience , sent him back again , and then he brought him .

Well but , says the other , let us drink our Punch out before we quarrel . - Come - to your Health ! - Do you drink it with all your Heart ? says Tothill . Yes , return 'd the Prisoner . Why then , says the Deceased , here 's to your Health .

John Saunders , Drawer at the Three Tuns in Chandos-street , deposed , that between 9 and 10 at Night , the Prisoner and the Deceased came in to drink . He snew 'd them up Stairs ; they call 'd for New Sherry ; he carry 'd it : They drank a Boat apiece , and he withdrew . In about five Minutes after , the Prisoner came to the Stairs-Head , and call 'd him up again . The Deceased was then lying on the Floor , to whom the Prisoner said , Tothill , was not you the Aggressor ? But he made no Answer at that time . A Surgeon was sent for , at whole coming in the Deceased said to the Prisoner , Next time I 'll fight you with Pistols . John Smalman , the Tavern Boy , deposed , that going to kindle a Fire in the Room where those two Gentlemen were , the Deceased kick 'd him out , and told him they did not want any Fire . He was afterwards sent for a Surgeon , and when he came back he heard the Deceased say , I was the Aggressor ; I drew first ; and if I die , 't is my own Fault . Mr. Wilky the Surgeon depos 'd , that about 11 at Night , he was call 'd to the Deceased , whom he found on the Floor , and the Prisoner supporting him in his Arms . After the Deceased was dress 'd , he said , I desire you would all take Notice ; I was the Aggressor ; I drew first , and it is my own Fault .

The Wound that the Deceased had then received was mortal , and he died in about twenty Hours after . Mr. Larouche in Round-Court , with whom the Deceased lodged , depos 'd , that about Midnight the Deceased was brought home in a Chair , very drunk , and dangerously wounded . The next day in the Afternoon , he asked him if he and the Prisoner were sober when they went to the Tavern together ? No , said the Deceased , but we were sober when we first met at the Coffee-house ; - We went from thence to the Tavern on purpose to fight ; - I believe we were both in Fault ; - I believe I drew first . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that when they came from the Coffee-house , the Deceased desired him to go to the Three Tuns , where he said he had appointed to meet a Gentleman . He went with him ; but finding nobody there , he drank once , and was for going away ; but the Deceased drew upon him , and bid him go to Hell . He retreated , and in so doing stumbled over some Faggots that lay in the Room . The Deceased follow 'd him , and put him under a Necessity of using his Sword in his own Defence .

When they had drank it , they came down Stair , and were going out together : But the Deceased , who sate below , call 'd out , Mr. Wilson , come and drink with me ; pray stay and drink with me ; and repeating his Entreaties several times , the Prisoner at last went to him . They then appear 'd to be very good Friends , and to this Evidence left them . He farther depos 'd , that he had known the Prisoner five Years , and always found him good-natur 'd and peaceable even in his Drink , and so far from being quarrelsome himself , that he was remarkably diligent in reconciling Differences among others . Mr. Thornton the Apothecary depos 'd , that being sent for to the Deceased about 11 at Night , he heard him say , Die or Live , 't is my own Fault ; I drew first and forced him to it : The Brigadier drew in his own Defence and therefore I desire you all to take Notice of what I have said . This was wrote down , and read over to the Deceased he said it was right , and pray 'd all that were present to sign it ; which they did , and he acknowledg 'd the same the next Day : It was produced in Court , and confirmed by the Subscribers . Major Wright , Capt . Batson , Capt Moreton , and Capt . Parker , gave the Prisoner the Character of a Man of an even Temper , never known to be passionate ; and that contary-wise , the Deceased was very apt to be quarrelsome in his Drink .

Benj Wright thus depos 'd . On Saturday Night I was drinking at the Cock in Whitechappel with my Master Thomas Munday , ( a Weaver ) who there paid me 13 s. 6 d. at 10 o ' Clock . The Prisoners came in , drank Brandy , and some Discourse passing between them and me about Kicking and Jumping , they ask 'd me what I was ? And my Wife answered jestingly , Perhaps he is a Running-Footman . They went away before 11 o'Clock , and I and my Wife , and Munday , went soon after Eleven . But some little Difference arising betwixt me and my Wife , I would not go home with her then , but would go first to her Father 's in Baker's-Row . My Wife went homewards ; and at the End of Greyhound Lane , I parted with Monday , and went to my Father-in-Law 's , with whom I staid till about Two about Two in the Morning , and then went to my own Door . The Key being usually left for me under the Door , I was stooping to take it from thence , when the Prisoners came up to me , Oh ! D - you , ( says Grayer ) you are the Running-Footman , are you ? What do you mean , Gentleman ? says I , D - him , says Whitehead to Grayer , Does be bid you stand ? Knock the Dog down . They beat me , hauled me away , and asked me where the other Rogue , Tom . Munday was ? I told them I could not tell . Then they said they would have my Money : And Whitehead held me , while Grayer thrust his Hand into my Pocket ; which bring Pretty right , the drawing his Hand out again , pulled the Lining after it ; and at the same time bursted the Wasteband of my Breeches , which was only fastened with a Pin . Gentleman , says I , have a Care what ye do , for I know ye both . This , I thought , would frighten them ; but I was mistaken , for then they beat me worse . And Whitehead cry 'd , Murder the Dog No , says Grayer , Let us carry him to the Watch-house . Pray , Gentlemen , says I , do n't kill me : Do but spare my Life , and carry me Where you please ; is will never be in my Power to do ye any Hart ; for I do n't know ye , and 't was nothing but a damned Lye that I told ye when I said I did . At last I got away from 'em , and ran for my Life to Mother Aldridge 's , at the Corner of White-street , and told her all that had happened . Elizabeth Aldridge thus depos 'd . About Two in the Morning I heard somebody knock at the Door ; and thinking it was a Kinsman of mine that I expected , I got up in the Dark , and let in the Prosecutor , who was then a Stranger to me . He presently lock 'd the Door . I was frightened when I found my Mistake , and would have put him out again ; but he beg 'd for the Lord 's Sake that I would let him stay , for he had been robb 'd of 10s . and was in Danger of being murdered . I struck a Light , and he shew 'd the several Places where he was very much Bruised . Tho Munday confirmed the Prosecutor 's Evidence so far as to their parting at Greybound-Lane . The Prisoners , then made their Defence . I am Servant ( says Whitehead ) to Mr. Robotham , who deals in Manchester Goods , and Mr. Grayer is one of his Customer 's . I had sold Mr. Grayer some Goods ; and we afterwards went to drink together at the Cock , where Wright and Munday forced their Discourse to us , the former pretending to be a Running-Footman , and was for laying Wagers of his own Activity . We not liking their Company , went from thence to the Blind Beggar of Bednal-Green , where we staid till it was late . It was a Moon-Light-Night . We came away together , and at the End of Greybound-Lane , Wright met me , and stopt me , and hollowed for his Companion , who started from behind us . I knock 'd Wright down ; upon which , his Companion threw a Brick-Bat at us , and ran away . I ask 'd Wright why he stopt me ? Gentlemen , says he , if you knew but my Necessity , you would not blame me for going upon the Highway . My Wife is ready to Lie-in , and I have not a Farthing as myself or her . For God 's Sake let me go . I told him I would first know who his Companion was . He refused to name him for a long time ; but as last , threatning to carry him to the Watch-house , he said it was Munday . Some People who lived there-abouts , looked out of their Windows , heard this and a great deal more . One of them bid us search him to see if he had any Pistols about him ; which we did , but found none . In the Struggle , his Breeches fell down , but he pinn 'd them again , and got away . Mary Howard , Wim Stiles , and Mary Williamson , depos 'd , that hearing a Noise , they looked out of their Windows , and saw three Men quarreling . Says one of the Men , Sirrah , what did you stop us for ? Are not you the Rogue that told us at the Cock Alehouse , that you was a Running Footman ? Who was your Companion that threw the Brick-Bat , and ran away ? He made no Answer ; they beat him , and then he said in a muttering Voice , ( as if he was afraid of being known by his Tongue . ) Well ! Gentlemen , I am a poor silly Fellow ; and if you will kill me , kill me ; but if you knew my Necessity , you could not blame me for what I have done . Mary Williamson called to them , and bid them not kill him , but search him , for fear he should have Pistols , and then carry him to the Watch-house : And the same muttering Voice , answered . Ay , search me and welcome . I am a poor silly Soul , and have not a Farthing in the World . They asked him again who his Companion was ? And he at last told them it was Monday . Mr. Robotham and several other Witnesses gave the Prisoners the Characters of honest industrious Men ; and that on the contrary , the Prosecutor was a Man of very ill Repute , and would swear any thing . The Jury acquitted 'em , and the Court granted'em a Copy of their Indictment . Francis Kite , alias Brooks , of Aldgate , was indicted for a Misdemeanor , in publishing and uttering , on the 26th of Jan . last , a Counterfeit Bank Note for 70 l. payable to Samuel Brooks , or Order , dated Jan. 23 . 1724. he knowing the same to be False and Counterfeit . It appeared that on Saturday the 23d of Jan. last , Twenty Pounds was paid into the Bank , for which a Bill , Numb . 107 , payable to Sam Brooks , or Bearer , was taken out by the Person that brought the Money ; but none of the Witnesses were positive that that Person was the Prisoner . Isaac Woodburn depos 'd thus . On Tuesday the 26th of Jan. about 8 at Night , the Prisoner came to my House , ( the Queen's-Head Tavern on Tower-Hill ) He called for Wine , and ordered a Chicken to be broil 'd for Supper . When he had done eating , he asked me if I could change him a Bank Bill , for he said he was obliged to go out of Town next Morning before the Bank would be open , and he should have Occasion for a little ready Money . The Bill was Numb . 10. dated the 23d of Jan 1724. for 70 l. payable to Sam . Brooks , or Bearer . Not having so much Cash by me at that time , I sent my Drawer with the Bill to Mr. Green , a Goldsmith in the Minories , who returned Word , that he believed that the Bill was very good , and he would have changed it with all his Heart ; but it happened that he had just before paid away a large Sum , and was unprovided . I shew 'd it to a Club of Gentlemen that were then in my House ; none of them could give me Money for it ; but they all agreed that it was good . I carried the Bill again to the Prisoner , and told him I could not get it chang 'd . He told me I need not be afraid , for the Bill was good ; it was taken out in his own Name , which was Sam . Brooks ; that he had three new Houses in Chiswel-street , and he lived in one of them , which was opposite the Tobacco-Roll : And then he asked me what Money I had in the House . I told him I could give him a 50 l. Bank Bill , 10 l. in Cash , and a Note on Demand for the other 10 l. He told me that would do very well . I called my Drawer to be a Witness , and gave the Prisoner the 50 l. Bill , and 10 l. in Money . But he told me , that since what they did was before Witness , he would not give me the Trouble of writing a Note for the Remaining 10 l. but he would take my Word , and call for it in two or three Days . He called for a Coach , ( No 370 ) and ordered the Coachman to drive him to Chiswell-street , and I saw him no more till the 7th of Feb. when hearing that he was in the new Jail in Southwark , I went thither to pay him a Visit . On Wednesday , the Day after he was at my House , I sent my Servant to the Bank with the Prisoner 's Bill , to receive 50 l. of the 70 l. which was readily paid him . And the next day , I sent him again for the remaining 20 l. which he also received . Most of this Evidence was confirm 'd by Sam Clark , the Drawer . John Pin , the Hackney Coachman , depos 'd , that the Prisoner ordered him to drive opposite the Tobacco-Roll in Chiswell-street ; but when he came to Aldgate , the Prisoner got out , gave him two or three hard Words , and a Shilling , and went away . Mr. Legross depos 'd , that he made Enquiry at the Tobacco-Roll , the Black Raven , and several other Places in Chiswell-street , but could find nobody that knew , or had even heard of such a Man as Sam . Brooks , or Francis Kite , that had ever lived in that Parish ; and much less been Owner of three new Houses there . George Bromfield depos 'd , that the 50 l. Bill which Isaac Woodburn delivered to the Prisoner , was paid at the Bank to a Woman , on the 27th of Jan. ( which was the Day after the Prisoner took it of Woodburn ) . This was mentioned as a Circumstance of the Prisoner 's knowing the 70 l. Bill to be alter 'd ; for else he might have sent that as well as the other ; and if he had gone a Journey that Morning , he would have been as much hindred in waiting to receive the 50 l. as in waiting to receive 70 l. It appear 'd that that Bill was so nicely alter 'd , that it was not mistrusted even at the Bank , till they came to examine their Books , and then they found that there was no Bill payable to Sam . Brooks given out that day , but one for 20 l. Numb . 107 The Head of the [ I ] was taken off , and the Body of it turned into an [ S , ] the [ W ] was changed into [ Ev , ] and the [ 7 ] in the Number taken quite out . It appeared that the Prisoner went afterwards to the Fountain Tavern in the Borough . Drawer , says he , I have been a Gaming , and have lost 100l . and have wm 70 l. for which I have taken a Bank Note ; and if you 'll get it off for one presently , I 'll make you a handsome Amends , for I want a little Ready Money just now . The Drawer carry 'd it to several Gentlemen in the House , but none of them could change it . The Chester Man being robb 'd but a little before , and the Oddness of the Prisoner 's offering a Gratuity to the Drawer , began at last to raise a suspicion in some or them , that this Bill was taken from thence . Away the Drawer was sent to the Bank , but he came too late to receive the Money for it : However , they told him it was good , and if he came the next day , they 'd pay him . From thence he went to the Post Office , but could make no Discovery . In the mean while , the Prisoner appeared very uneasy , and ask 'd Mr . Parks ( the Master of the Tavern ) if his Drawer was honest ; and told him , that if a Drawer proves a Rogue in such a Case the Money will be expected from his Master . The Prisoner still being suspected , he was taken into Custody till farther Enquiry could be made . Guilty . Pillory , fined 20 l. six Months Imprisonment , and security for 12 Months .

Not long after I saw them again , and they told me that they had taken a very good Bail-Bond , sign 'd by John Wilson , a Founder , next to the Adam and Eve in Long-Lane , and William Smith , a Farrier in the Borough ; Tho Pixley the Defendant , and themselves , as Witnesses ; and that they had deliver 'd the said Bond into the Sheriff 's Office . I went to the said Office in Thavies , where I found it , and took out an Assignment . I had been several times to enquire after these two Bondsmen , but could never find them ; and having afterwards another Writ against Pixley , I carried it to the Prisoners , and asked them , Why they made me run after People that were not to be found ? They then both confess 'd that it was all wrong , and that they knew no such Persons as John Wilson and William Smith . But ( says Leman ) it was Terril that signed the Bond with those Names . Mr. Pepper , ( says Terril ) I call 'd this Old Rogue Lemon aside , and told him , that we above all Men ought never to have served you so , because you had always been our very good Friend . G - Damn ye for a Fool , ( says he ) you 'll never know your Business ; for as Pepper is our Friend , he will do us no Hurt ; and as the Plaintiff Quessenborough is your Kinsman , we have nothing to fear from him . - Take it for a Rule from me , If a Man has a mind to be a Rogue , 't is his safest way to practice it upon his Friends . Samuel Quessenborough thus deposed : There being no such Bondsmen as John Wilson and William Smith to be found , I began a Prosecution against Terril in the Court of Common Pleas ; and meeting him afterwards , Why ( says he ) do you prosecute me ? Do you expect that I shall pay the Debt ? You have Reason to pay it , ( says I ) for it had been secured before now , if you had taken good Bail . Why , that 's true , says he , 't is a false Bond . Lemon 's an Old Rogue , and I would have persuaded been from it , for I thought what it would come to ; but he would not regard me . The Jury found them both guilty of the whole Indictment .

The Prisoner in his Defence said , that he bought the Wig of one John Brian for 10s . at the Bird-in Hand at Cow-Cross , on Tuesday Morning ; and that John Coomes ( a Boy ) was then present .

She went home about 11 o'Clock , and left all safe ; and on the Monday Morning following , she found Part of the Partition , betwixt her Shop and the other , broken down , and a great many of her Goods gone , to the Value of above 5 l. some of which she found in the Back-Shop , where the Prisoner us 'd to lie . She met him afterwards , and secured him . The Prisoner , in his Defence , brought a Witness to swear , that he was not out of his own Lodging in Brown 's Lane in Shoreditch , from Saturday in the Evening , till Monday Morning . But the Evidence against him being very positive , the Jury found him guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d. Transportation . Anthony Areton , of Whitechappel , was indicted for stealing a Cloth Coat , val . 20 s. the Goods of Edward Rudge , on the 28th of Dec . last .

Jonathan Hughs depos 'd , that he bought the Coat of Joseph Walters , and I ( depos 'd Joseph Walters ) bought the Coat of - Bains ; who stole it . It is my Business to buy and sell old Things : and as I was selling some so - s Wheatly , a Salesman , in Monmouth street , Bains came thither and desired Wheatly to go with him to fetch a Coat out of Pawn . Wheatly was busy , and desired me to go ; and I went and paid 9 s. 3 d. for the Coat , and sold it again to Jonathan Hughs for 10 s. I afterwards hearing that the Coat was stole , went to Wheatly , who directed me to the Prisoner . I charged a Constable with him , and he was carried before two or three Justices at Button 's Coffee-house in Covent Garden ; but there being nobody them present , that could swear to the stealing of the Coat , he was set at Liberty . The Course of this Evidence not at all affecting the Prisoner , the Jury acquitted him . Mary Webb , of S.

Eliz . Ashford ( at the Corner of New Queen-street in Tyburn Road ) thus depos 'd : The Prisoner was a former Acquaintance of mine , and came to see me . After some Talk , she desired me to go of an Errand for her to her Mother 's in Russel Court in Drury-Lane . When I came thither , her Mother bade me make haste back again , or , says she , my Daughter will rob you before you get home . I found her Words true , for the Prisoner was indeed gone away with my Goods ; and I saw her no more till about a Fortnight before Christmas , when I accidentally met her in Whitechappel , and held her till I got others to assist me . She confess 'd that she had sold some of the Goods at Chipping-Norton . She was committed to Newgate , where she has since Lain-in . The Jury acquitted her .
