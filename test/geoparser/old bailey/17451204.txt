Q . In what Part of the House was your Money ? Thomas Mears . It was in a Chest of Drawers in the Back Room . Q . Were your Drawers broke open ? Thomas Mears . No , my Lord . William Browne . I am a Constable of Trinity in the Minories , and I was out to search for this Boy three or four Hours , and could find nothing of him . We shut up the Gate of our Parish , and I told the Watchmen , if any such Boy was seen by them , to lay hold on him ; for this Boy had been seen by one of the Watchmen .

At the Queen's-Head near Whitechapel Church . The Prisoner wanted a Lodging , and desir 'd to lie at my House , even if it were with my Soldier . He call 'd for a Pint of Hot-Pot . I told him that the Soldier was upon Duty , and he might lie in the Soldier 's Bed . I locked up my Till , in which there were some Keys and a Silver Spoon ; but in the Morning I found the Till broke open and the Spoon gone . There was no Body else in the House that I could suspect : Accordingly we took him up , and carry 'd him before Justice Rickards , and there I found a Handkerchief of mine within the Lining of the Crown of his Hat , an it was mark 'd with my Name . This is the Handkerchief that was found upon him before the Justice . Q . What is the Value of the Handkerchief ? James Hawkins . I value it at one Shilling . Prisoner . When I was search 'd by the Prosecutor , he had my Hat in his Hand a Quarter of an Hour . James Jasper .

John Mason , was indicted for stealing a Bank Note of 20 l. the Property of Elizabeth Matthews . Elizabeth Matthews . The Prisoner at the Bar was my Footman . I had a Draught of 50 l. upon Mr. Neal , my Son-in-Law , and I sent the Prisoner with the Draught to Mr. Martin 's , the Banker , ordering him to bring me two 20 l. Bank Notes and 10 l. in Money ; and accordingly he brought me back the two Bank Notes and ten Pounds in Cash for the Draught . I was not very well . I was at Mr. Neal 's House in Million-Bank , and he brought me the Notes up into my Daughter 's Chamber : I put them into my Purse , and the Purse into my Pocket . When I came Home I lock 'd them up in my Buroe , in my own Bed-Chamber . This was over-Night ; and the next Morning the Prisoner came up to know my Orders , and I had Occasion to send him to the Toy-Shop : He came close to my Dressing-Table to have his Order ; I got up and went to my Buroe to take my Purse and give him the Studs that were in it ; I turn 'd my Purse inside-out upon the Table , Money and Notes - Q . Did you see the Note at that Time ? Elizabeth Matthews . Yes , my Lord . I did this to find the two Studs that were at the Bottom of the Purse . After this , I put the Money again into the Purse , and going to put the Notes in , said I , Here is but one Bank Note ; the other Note was gone . Look , Madam , said he , is it not upon the Ground ? Well , we search 'd diligently , but it could not be found . I look 'd , and said it was not on the Ground . I did not charge him with taking it , nor mistrust him , as he had liv 'd with me between two and three Years . I sent him into the City to Mr. Neale 's , to know whether it did not slip out of my Hand in putting them into my Purse ; but there was none found there . After this he ( Mr. Neal ) went with me to the Bank , to stop the Payment of the Note : The Prisoner also went there with me . Then I thought no more of it . Ebenezer Blackwell . This was a Draught for 50 l. upon Mr. Neal . The Bearer of it was one John Mason , who brought it from Mrs. Matthews , and he had in exchange two Bank Notes of 20 l. each , and 10 l. in Money . And this Bank Note does exactly correspond with the Bank Note then given ; for we enter the Number , Date and Sum of every Note coming in or going out . This Note being stolen , was brought to me : I examin 'd it by our Books , and found it correspond with the Number , Date and Sum of the Entry thereof paid unto Mr. Neal 's Draught ; and because I would be sure it was right , I put the second Letter of my Name . Q . From whom receiv 'd you this Note ? Ebenezer Blackwell . From a Clerk of the Bank : Mr. Neal 's Clerk was with me first of all . Q. Madam , are you sure that this is the Prisoner 's Hand-writing ? Mrs. Matthews . Yes , I have seen him write several Times , and I am sure it is his own Hand-writing . Hinckley Phipps . The Prisoner , my Lord , came to my Shop in Cheapside : I am a Linnen-Draper , and he came and bought Cloth of my Man to the Amount of 2 l. 13 s. after which he presented the Bill to my Man and desired Change , and truly I did not care to change it for so little Money being laid out : But , however , I bid my Man run down with it to the Bank , and see whether it was a good Note . But my Servant returning , tells me that the Payment of it was stopt at the Bank , which I immediately acquainted the Prisoner with , and told him that I would go with him to the Bank , to know the Reason of it . As we were going along I asked him about his receiving it , and he said that he receiv 'd it of one Sands , a Barber in Holborn ; and he speaking broad , I asked him whether he was a Scoth Hair Merchant ? and he said that he was , and that he had given for the Bank-Note 12 l. in Hair and 8 l. in Money . He was then well dress 'd , like a Merchant ; he had on a Snuff-colour 'd Coat , a Silk Waistcoat of the same Colour , and a white Wig . He gave in his Name at the Bank , Thomas Turner ; the Clerk asked him some Questions , how he came by it , and he told him the same Story that I have just related to your Lordship . He said his Name was Turner , and that he lived at the Blue Boar at Turn-Stile in Holborn . My Lord , I did believe him to be entirely innocent to the last Degree , for he had a very steady Countenance and an Air of Honesty ; and therefore I offer 'd my Service to go along with him to Mr. Neal 's , to know the Reason why the Note was stopt , for it appear 'd at the Bank that it was stopt by Mr. Neal . He made no Scruple to go to Mr. Neal ; but as we were walking along in Lombard-Street , I turn 'd about to speak to him , and he was gone . Mr. Neal lives in a Court in Lombard-Street . When I missed him then , I was resolved to go to Mr. Neal 's , where describing the Man , they thought the Description answer 'd to Mrs. Matthews 's Footman , and they told me that he was to go to live with Dr. Jurin . I afterwards saw him , and knew him to be the Man that brought me the Bank Note , and he confess 'd it before Sir Thomas De Veil . Q . Well , Sir , can you swear that this is the same Note ? Hinckley Phipps . It is the same Number , but my Knowledge may not amount to a sufficient Testimony to swear ; yet I verily believe it is . The Prisoner said at Sir Thomas De Veil 's , that he brought this Bank-Note to me : He said there that he took it off of the Ground ; and before he said , that he had it of a Barber in Holborn . He denied for two Hours together at Dr. Jurin 's , that ever he saw my Face , and with such a steady Countenance that I never saw the like before in all my Life . Thomas Green . The Prisoner , on Saturday was a Fortnight , bought Irish Cloth to the Value of 2 d. 13 s. and after he bought it , he gave me a Bank Bill for Change : I carried it to my Master in the Counting-House , and he sent me down to the Bank , to see whether it was a good Note . Q . Was that the Note ? Green . I ca n't be positive that was the Note . Q . Are you sure that the Prisoner at the Bar did buy the Cloth ? Green . Yes , very sure . I am a Servant to Mr. Phipps . I know that I carried the Note to the Bank Saturday was a Fortnight , and found the Payment of it stopt . William Cutler . I am a Clerk at the Bank . This Note was brought to me , and he that brought it said he came from Mr. Phipps . I told him it was a stopt Note , and asked who he took it of ; and he said there was a Person in his Master 's Shop that brought it , and I told him he must bring the Person to the Bank , that he might make out his Claim to it . Mr. Phipps and the Prisoner , I believe it was , came to the Bank , and I went up with them to the Secretary ; and Mr. Phipps said that he would go along with him ( the Prisoner ) to Mr. Neal 's . He said at the Bank that he sold some Hair to a Barber , and gave him 8 l. in Change out of the Note ; upon which they went away to Mr. Neal 's . This Note has been in my Custody ever since the 16th of November : This is the very Note , and it has been in my Possession ever since : Shew it to Ebenezer Blackwell . Ebenezer Blackwell . This is the Note that is in our Book . Q . How does it appear that this is stopt in Payment ? Do you remember the Time of the Entry , and by whom enter 'd ? Blackwell . By the Secretary 's Clerk : It is a Bank Note enter 'd in the Books of the Bank . Mr. Morris . I am Cashier of the Bank : I know nothing more of it , than that this is a Bank Note signed by me . Prisoner . I do n't very well know how I came by it , but I took up this Note with another Piece of Paper , and put it into my Frock-pocket , but did not know at all that I had it . Q . But when you found it , why did you not carry it to your Mistress , instead of going to the Shop to buy Goods ? John Brown . I have known the Prisoner at the Bar these nine Years ; he has a very honest Character . I keep a publick House in Newport Market . William Dixon . I have known the Prisoner about seven Years , and he has a very honest Character . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 4. William Hales and Robert Skeen , were indicted for the Murder of William Huff , on the 30th of August . Elizabeth Huff . My Lord , I have no more to say , but that my Husband died in the Infirmary in Goodman's-Fields the 14th of September . My Husband was a Wheelwright , and was making a great Wheel . I saw him at work about a Quarter of an Hour , and I went home that Night . He came Home very much wounded , and I asked him how it happen 'd ; and he said two Men came into the Shop ( the Prisoners at the Bar ) and they threatned his Life . The Wound , I believe , was an Inch and a Quarter broad and long ; he bled very much ; I got him a Pennyworth of Diaculum , and scraped some Lint , and made a Plaister , and put it on , and put him to Bed ; and I put a Sheet under his Leg : He bled very much , and had no Sleep that Night , but was Light-headed . There was among the Wheelwrights a Confederacy , or a Combination ; and these were those that threatned both Master and Man ; and they said that they would do it for them , and they doubled their Fists ; and William Hales and Robert Skeen had before threatned him . The Day that these two Men came into the Shop , he borrow 'd 18d . and spent a Shilling upon them , and they went away . After this they came again , and asked him to go out with them , but he would not ; and they wanted Small Beer , but he would not give them any , but gave them three Half-pence to buy a Pint of Beer . As he was at work his Adze fell upon his Knee , and cut him much ; and William Hales said , Madam , I have made your Man cut himself , give him a Plaister . Q . What said t'other ? Elizabeth Huff . Robert Skeen said , that he was sorry that he came into the Shop . My Husband declared all this to me upon his Death-Red , and he said it was the Cause of his Death ; and I asked him , whether he thought it was wilful , and he said it was . Q . Did you hear any Thing of your Husband 's being press 'd for a Soldier ? Eliz . Huff . I heard there was a Wheelwright that would have had him press 'd . Mary Brown . One of them ( the Prisoners at the Bar ) said that he ( the Deceased ) should go for a Soldier : Several Oaths passed between them , and presently my Maid said that Huff was cut , and there was a great deal of Blood , and that one of them said to Huff , I am sorry that I made you cut yourself . He ( the Deceased ) came and laid his Leg at my Door , and I got some Brandy and fine Sugar for him ; and he said , It is hard for me to be cut , and I believe it will be my Death ; they said that I should not finish my Work . There was the next Morning a great deal of Blood ; and some Hours before he died he said , I shall never live to see another Day , but I hope that God and you will right my Wife . William Bosworth . I accidentally went into Mr. Brown 's Shop , and when I came in I heard rash Words ; and I heard one of them two ( the Prisoner at the Bar ) say , God d - n his Blood , I believe I have cur 'd him for to-Day . William Hall . I thought I heard one of them say , that he was very sorry ; and the other said , God d - n his Blood , I have cur 'd him for working to-Day . Mr. Brown not being at Home , I went away as fast as I could . William Brown . I came Home at about 11 o'Clock at Night , and went down early in the Morning , and the Room was very bloody ; and I enquir 'd who did this , and they said the Prisoners at the Bar . They had several Times threaten 'd him that he should not work , because they are in a Combination to raise the Price of their Wages ; and they swore that they would soon cause him to leave Work . Q. Philip Barton , what have you to say ? Philip Barton . No farther than what he ( the Deceas 'd ) said unto me : On the 10th of September , I saw him at the Infirmary in Goodman's-Fields , and I ask 'd him what they said of his Wound , and how it happen 'd ? He said one ( of the Prisoners ) was sorry , and the other seem 'd glad , and that he said , Madam , I have made your Man cut himself . John Hanson . I did apprehend that I should have no Occasion to come here , because he ( the Deceas 'd ) seem 'd to say that it was accidental . Q. Henry Stephens . Do you know the Prisoners at the Bar ; did you know the Deceas 'd ? Henry Stephens . I work 'd for Mr. Brown at that Time , I was at work just by him , and these two Men came into the Shop , and seem 'd to be in a good Humour , and said , we must all go for Soldiers ; and two Days before we had a great deal of Talk of their Exercise , and that in a good Humour . The Deceas 'd went up and stood by him on his right Hand , and Skeen , after he had been joking about going to Flanders , ask 'd if they had any Beer ; and he found a Pot . Q . Were they Friends before the Stroke ; did you see any of the Prisoners do any Thing to the Deceas 'd ; was you at any Time in Company with them after the Wound and before his Death ? Henry Stephens . The next Morning after he came into the Shop . William Hales and Robert Skeen both acquitted . 5.

In what Manner was the Gentleman familiar with her ? Elizabeth Lloyd . They were talking together , and the Gentleman took his Watch out of his Fob , and put it into his Coat-Pocket . I stood close by her , and there was Light in the Street by the Lamps , and I saw her put her Hand into his Coat-Pocket and take it out ; after that he fell down by a Blow that she gave him , he being much in Liquor . She went to her Mother , and her Mother gave her 40 Shillings for the Watch . Q . What Discourse was there between the old Woman , her and you ? Elizabeth Lloyd . It was all about picking the Gentleman 's Pocket . Sometime after this , it ( the Watch ) was read in the Advertiser , and there was a Guinea and a half Reward for them that would bring it . Q . You say the Mother gave 40 Shillings for it ? Elizabeth Lloyd . Not that Night , but the next Day . Q . Who was by ? Elizabeth Lloyd . None but the Mother , she and I . Prosecutor . The Watch cost me four Guineas at second Hand . I have had it four Years . Q . What do you think it worth ? Can you pawn or sell the Watch , or such a Watch as this , for more ? Prosecutor . Indeed , I am no Judge of the Value of Watches . - Barnes . The Night that the Prosecutor lost his Watch , he said he had been robb 'd of his Watch and some Silver ; and the Gentleman came the next Day to advertise his Watch : He said he would give a Guinea and a half ; and then we heard no more of it 'till this young one was committed to the Gatehouse . Prosecutor . She sent a Person to tell me , that there was a Person in the Gatehouse that could help me again to the Watch : she said , she was concern 'd with a Man , and if you are the Man , you have lost something else besides your Watch . I told her that I had a Leaden shilling in my Pocket , that I took a Day or two before . Then she said , you are the Man that I robb 'd . Accordingly she said that she would make an Information , and she did before Sir Thomas De Veil , and he gave a Search-Warrant to search the Mother of this Newberry : She is the Husband 's Mother . Having the Warrant , we went into the Room , and he [ John Rolton ] search 'd the old Woman 's Pockets , and said I believe I have got it ; And he said , Sir , is this your Watch ; and I said , if it is open 'd I can tell , because the Name is Stone , which Name somebody had endeavour 'd to craze out : We took it away . The old Woman said it was her Son 's Watch ; and the Daughter said that she had fetch 'd it out of Pawn , and that it was her Husband 's Watch . Prisoner Elizabeth .

This Evidence has charg 'd me with a Pair of Ear-rings : She wants to swear a Street-Robbery upon me . Prisoner Susanna . I bought this Watch of the Evidence and this Woman : She said to me , Mother , will you buy my Husband 's Watch ? and I bought it , and borrow 'd Part of the Money ; and I pinn 'd it up , and said , It shall not be seen 'till I see my Child 's Face .

Mrs. Newberry came to me , and desir 'd to borrow a little Money , for her Son had been extravagant , and his Watch lay in Pawn , and she was willing to have it , to remember him . Well I lent her what she desir 'd : If it had been the whole 40 Shillings , she should have had it . I keep a Butcher 's Shop , went to carry out Meat , and call 'd in at her House .

He brought Worsted to sell to my Mistress ; he said it was Irish Worsted , and that it was none of his own ; and he said he wanted to say something to my Mistress : And he put his Hand round her Neck and buss 'd her ; and he said to me , why do n't you get withinside of her ? I saw him with his Hand round her Neck , and that is all I have to say . I heard her say indeed , that she would not be teaz 'd so . - Bromley . I have known the Prisoner 10 Years ; my Business is a Weaver ; he is a Woollcomber ; he makes Worsted to fell it . - .

I am inform 'd that she has charg 'd another Person with this Bracelet . Bromley . I will declare the Truth . That Gentlewoman would have sent my Daughter on an Errand , to ask one Bell , whether or no she had not the Necklace . The Girl comes up to me and says , Father , shall I go of the Errand , what Harm is there in it ? But I would not let her go , because I had a Reason for it ; I am a Papist , and did not care to have any Trouble in my Neighbourhood ; I am a Weaver by Trade , and a Worsted-Weaver . Hugh Molloy . I am a Weaver . I have dealt with him ( the Prisoner ) for Pounds , and have found him always a very honest Man . I heard the Prosecutor charge Bell with it ( the Necklace ) Yesterday . Q .

He supposes it to be taken or cut from behind the Coach ; and upon going into Little Queen-Street he missed his Horse , and asked if any Body had seen a saddled Horse . He told me what had happened , and I bid him go to the Green-Yard and to several Inns , to see if he could hear any Thing of him . And on Saturday I found the Horse and Saddle was advertised by Sir Thomas De Veil ; and I found him at the White Horse at the Back of Long Acre , and he was deliver 'd to me by an Order of Sir Thomas De Veil . Prisoner . I pick 'd the Horse up in Holborn , as I was going home . - Clay . He brought the Saddle to me one Saturday Night about Eight o'Clock to sell ; and I asked what he would have for it , and he said Half a Guinea .

The Saddle when new was worth 50 s. and it is worth 20 s. now . Benjamin Smith . I am the Coachman , and came from Bath , and tied the Horse , as I thought , behind the Landau , and by the Light of the Lamps I saw the Shade of the Horse every now and then ; but coming up into Holborn in the Dark , I turned short away into Queen-Street , I missed him , and enquired when I missed him , but no Body could tell me any Thing of him .

John Oakes , was indicted for High Treason , for that he , not weighing the Duty of his Allegiance , and devising and intending our Lord the King and his People to deceive , on the 10th Day of October last , in the Parish of St. Giles 's Cripplegate , London , 40 Pieces of false , forg 'd and counterfeit Money and Coin , to the Likeness and Similitude of good , legal current Silver Coin of this Realm call 'd Shillings , did make , forge and counterfeit , against the Duty of his Allegiance , & c. and against the Form of the Statute & c . Gentlemen , I am Counsel for the Crown , and he stands indicted for High Treason , for counterfeiting the current Coin of this Kingdom . Gentlemen , I am not willing to aggravate this above its Demerit ; not to inspire the Breasts of the Jury with Sentiments to prejudice them against the Prisoner at the Bar , who stands upon his Trial for Life or Death . Gentlemen , undoubtedly it is the Prerogative of the Crown to take Care of the current Coin of the Kingdom . The Prisoner at the Bar is indicted for coining of Shillings ; and I beg that you would observe how this falls among the working Poor of the Nation . Suppose a Man works hard all Day for a Shilling , and at Night shall receive one of these bad ones , that is not worth a Farthing : What Distress does this bring into a Family , where there is a Wife and Children . The Prisoner at the Bar is an old Offender , and hath practis 'd it 14 Years ; and the Method of finding him out was by Mr. Smith . The Prisoner at at the Bar and Mr. Smith carry 'd on this Affair : The first 10 coin , and the last to put them off when coin 'd . The better to effect this , they often took Journeys , sometimes to Worcester , sometimes to Newcastle , sometimes to one Place , and sometimes to another ; and then , when they took these Journeys , they carry 'd a Quantity of these Shillings with them . But Smith happened to be detected at Basingstoke ; a Quantity of them were found upon him . He acquainted us that the Person he was concern 'd with was one Oakes , and that he liv 'd in White-Cross Street . Now Gentlemen , it is not upon the single Testimony or Evidence of Smith that we are endeavouring to prove him guilty ; for the Gentlemen of the Mint made an Enquiry , and they found in his Lodgings a great many Pieces ready made , and others almost finish 'd ; and they found the Instruments to carry on the Work , which are now in our Custody . Mr. Smith has a great many Times , and that Years ago , had Part of that Money to set out of Town withal , and he hath seen him coin it and wash it . Prisoner , My Lord , put off my Trial for an Hour . Q . ( to William Smith . ) Look at the Prisoner at the Bar . How long have you been acquainted with him . Smith . Fourteen Years . My first Acquaintance with him was in the Horse-Grenadiers ; about six Years ago was the first Time he said any Thing to me : Says he to me , You have a Family , and he immediately pull 'd out of his Pocket three or four Shillings . I went with him to the Noah's-Ark , and he put off one Shilling ; and we went to the Coach and Horses , and there he put off another . He found out where I liv 'd , and I went along with him , and he put off three or four Shillings at a Time . This pass 'd on 'till Witsuntide . He liv 'd then in Lamb-Court in Clerkenwell . When I came to see him , I open 'd the Door , and I saw him coining with these Things ; and there was Whiting and a great many ready coin 'd , I believe to the Value of three or four Pounds . I saw with him a Pipe . Q . What is the Composition ? Smith . What is the Composition ! I do n't know ; but he made Use of that Mould ; there was an Impression to make a Shilling , after he cut off the Stem , and he fil 'd it . And after that he inveigl 'd me to go with him into the Country ; and we went to Newcastle and Peterborough , and we went with about 5 l. of them . I carry 'd the Money that Time , and he put it off ; and he told me he design 'd to go to Worcester and Bristol . Q . And you was at Basingstoke . Did you carry any of that Money with you ? Smith . Yes . I have seen him file 10 or 12 Pieces of that Counterfeit Matter , which had the Similitude of an English Shilling . He had Salt and Wax-Candle to rub it over with , to make it have a dull Hue ; and he stroak 'd it round with a File , to take off the rough Edge . Q . When you went to Basingstoke , did he give you Money ? Smith . He was to meet me behind Montague-House , and I agreed to go as the Monday-Sen'night after . Some Time after he brings me a Horse at Five o'Clock in the Morning , and I went upon the Expedition , and he gave me a Box and a White Rug . Prisoner . What he says I shall prove to be false . I shall say nothing yet . William Rubby . These are the Things we found in his Room . There was a Box . Q . ( to Smith . ) Is this the same that you receiv 'd from the Prisoner . Smith . This is the same Sort of Counterfeit , this is the same Coin that I receiv 'd ; there is no Addition nor Alteration ; I declare it to be the same Sort that he gave me . Prisoner . My Lord , I shall ask no Questions . He swears as he pleases . Q . ( to Rubby ) Did you find this Mould in his Room ? Are they proper for coining Shillings ? Rubby . His Room is a lower Room ; it was not locked up , but they were found amongst some Flocks . Q . Have you any skill ; are you concerned either in Silver or Brass ; did you find any Thing else besides the Mould ? Rubby . Some counterfeit Shillings , Mould and Flask . Q . Was there any Thing else besides ? Rubby . There was Whiting and Wax-Candle , and there was a File . Q. in what Part of the Room ? Rubby . Some in one Part and some in another : Some Pieces of Money lay upon a Ledge . We search 'd the Fire-Place and found several Pieces of Metal . There was a Bed in the Room . Q . When you came into the Room , what did you meet with ? Rubby . These several Pieces in several Places . Prisoner . It was thrown about the Room . I have no Counsel . I did not know what they were for ; It was Smith that brought them and left them there . Q . ( to Rubby . ) Was you in the Room ? Look at the Things . Rubby . This is the Metal that we found ; we found it upon a Ledge in the Wall higher than a Man 's Head , on the 11th of October last . When these Things were found there , he surrender 'd himself immediately . His Wife and Daughter seem 'd surpriz 'd . We found in a Basket of Flocks the Mould and the Flask . There seems to me to be some small Particles of the Metal in the File . I have look 'd upon the Money , and it is all counterfeit . Q . ( to Hannah Lister . ) Look at the Prisoner at the Bar . Do you know him ? Lister . He called once at my House at Tottenham-Court . He once kept the House that I now live in . Last Tottenham-Court-Fair was two Years , he call 'd at my House to drink , and he gave me a bad Shilling ; but I saw it , and told him of it , and he gave me a better . Prisoner . About the 5th of September I met Mr. Smith , and he ask 'd me if I could tell him where he might put a Horse to Grass . I said there was Grass enough now , but I told him I did believe that the Man at the Royal-Oak at Vauxhall had Grass to let . My Lord , I and he drank together at the George in Tyburn Road ; and I said I am now going to the Horse Ferry ; and he fetched the Horse , and I put it for him to Grass at 12 s. a Month . As soon as I had done it and acquainted him with the Agreement , he said it was a great Price , and he would put it into another Place to Grass . I told him I did not care ; but I did not see him for three Weeks ; and when I saw him after , he was offering a Mare to sell . I looked up the Yard , and I said to the Man that was with me , stop a little , I shall speak to one here . And I went , and found that he was going to sell the Mare to one Mr. Taylor , a Gentleman of about 6 or 700 l. a Year . I said , your Servant Mr. Smith . Mr. Taylor said , do you know that Man ? Yes , said I . Said he , I hope that he is an honest Man . Said I , as for Honesty , I ca n't give him a Character , for I do n't understand how he should deal in Horses , seeing he has not wherewithal to carry on the Business . After this I asked Smith , when he would come and take his away ? and sometime after this , he came one Day to my House , and left a Bag , and threw it down upon the End of the Counter . I went over the Way for a Pint of Beer : My Wife happen 'd to tumble down the Bag , and these Things , all of them , sell out of it ; and she stoop 'd down , and took up a Piece of Wood , a File , and three or four Pieces of Pewter . The Bag was thrown aside . He never came for the Bag , nor after the Things . I heard no more of him 'till he came to take me up . Here the Prisoner called Persons to his Reputation . Joseph Allen . I have known this Man 15 or 16 Years ; I never heard any Thing amiss in his Character : He is a Painter by Trade . William Brown . I am a Joiner . I have known him many Years ago . William Bird . I know him very well . He is a good-natur 'd Man : He has passed his Word for other People , and so has suffered by it . He has helped those that in the Time of his Trouble would not come near him . Q . What are you ? Bird . I live at a Hair-Merchant 's in Green-Street , Leicester-Fields , at the Sign of the Lock of Hair . Stephen Greenlitt . He used to come to my Father 's ; we are partly Relations , we are Cousins . About two Years ago he took an Alehouse in Castle Yard , but for want of Stock to carry it on , he was forced to leave it . William Backwin . I have known Mr. Oakes these ten Years . I have worked for him in the Painting Way , and he is an honest Man . Q . Did you ever hear that he was a Coiner ? Backwin . So far from that , that he was always poor . - Wilkinson . I think his Character is as different from that of a Coiner , as I am from being a Woman . I have changed Guineas and Shillings for him , and I never had one bad one of him in all my Life . My Money goes to my Brewer and Distiller . John Hodgley . I am a Carpenter . I have worked for him , and he for me in the Way of Painting . I believe he is a very honest Man . Hugh Ruck . I knew him in Prison , and he lay with me there half a Year , and he always behaved as an honest Man . Q . What was you there a Prisoner for ? Ruck . For Smuggling , but by the King 's Grace I came out . James Brittle . I know the Prisoner at the Bar . I have built four Houses , and he hath worked for me , and I find him to be a Workman , and that he did his Business in a Workman-like Manner . Thomas Lister . I do n't know much of him . I know the House that he kept , and I have heard that he is a Coiner . The Jury desired to withdraw , which was granted ; and when they were withdrawn , they sent a Message , desiring that a Shilling or two might be brought to them with Instruments ; which was done accordingly ; and after sometime they returned and brought in their Verdict , not Guilty . Acquitted . 33. Joseph Payne , was indicted for a Misdemeanour , in uttering certain dangerous and treasonable Words against our Sovereign Lord the King , that is to say , D - n you and your King too , and drinking the Pretender 's Health . Gentlemen of the Jury . Payne stands indicted for a great Misdemeanour , for Words spoken by him very disrespectini to his Most Excellent Majesty King GEORGE ; and in Company with Smith and others he said , God bless the Pretender , and here 's a Health to the British Arms , ( meaning the Rebel Army ) and saying to William Landey and Matthew Dawney , D - n you and your King too , and God bless the Pretender . Q . ( to George Norman ) Look at the Prisoner at the Bar ? Norman . I know him again . On the 7th of Nov. he was at my House at the Bull Inn in Bishopsgate-Street . I saw the Prisoner at the Bar about Seven at Night . I heard him drink King GEORGE 's Health , and Success to the British Arms , and God bless the Pretender . There were two Soldiers in the Room : One of them was Will . Landey , and the other was Matthew Dawney . They were in the same Room , but I think not in the same Box . Q . Do you remember any Words that passed between him and the Soldiers ? and that the Soldiers should say , they would not have their Master abused ; and that he should say , God d - n you and your King too ? Prisoner . I would say something . Since I have been brought to Newgate I have had a great deal of Cold , that it has broke my Voice . I am slow in Speech , and short in Memory . This is the first Time that ever I was brought before a Court in all my Life ; but when I was there I was in Drink , and very much intoxicated with Liquor . Joseph Johnson . This Man was at our Inn . I am a Porter there . I thought I saw him Yesterday was a Month at our Inn ; and when he first came in , there were two or three Songs sung , and he drinked , and he drinked Healths , and he said , Here 's a Health to King George , Success to the British Arms , Here 's a Health to the Pretender . Q . Was any Body in Company with him ? Johnson . There was Dawney and Landey ; and they said it was not their Duty to hear the King spoke against : And being a little stirr 'd up , he said to one of them , God d - n you and your King too . Q. Pray , did not he give a Man three Halfpence to drink the Pretender 's Health . Johnson . Speaking of the Pretender , he said that he pray 'd for him daily , and it was the Duty of a Christian to pray for his Enemies . Q. Pray , did you hear him drink King George 's Health . Johnson . Yes ; he both said King George and Royal George ; and he said , God bless King George , Success to the British Arms , and here 's a Health to the Pretender ; and he always all along said it was the Duty of a Christian to pray for his Enemies . Q . Was he sober then ? Johnson . No my Lord , very much in Drink . Q . ( to John Smith . ) What did you hear him by , and to whom ? Smith . When I come in , he had a Pot of Beer in his Hand , and he said , that they would not drink with him ; and he said , God d - n them and their King too . William Burr . All that I can say is only this : That when I came in he said , God bless King George , and Success to the British Arms , and here 's a Health to the Pretender . And I heard several Persons say , that they would have him go about his Business . Prisoner . I believe I left off when I said I was intoxicated with Liquor [ and here he made the Court smile ; for he said that he was slow of Speech , that his Eyes were in the Eclipses , and his Memory short as the Top of a high Rock . ] The Day that I drop 'd into the Bull , I had been in Leadenhall-Street about Business , and it was to make a small Collection for a Gentleman 's Servant reduc 'd , and when I had done we had a Dish of Steaks , and with that we drank plentifully , and my Eyes began to be in the Eclipses . I went to the Bull to speak to a Gentleman 's Coachman that was to be there ; and light of another there in the Yard , and I ask 'd him to go and drink . How much I did drink I ca n't tell . It was at Noon when I came into the Bull , and late at Night I went away , and the next Morning I found myself in the Counter . Next Morning I was hurry 'd away to Guildhall , and then afterwards to Newgate . When I first went into the Bull I had 17 s. about me ; and next Morning when I awak 'd in the Counter , I had but one . Give me Leave ; with Submission , if I might have Leave , I will give your Lordship an Account of the Pilgrimage of my Life and Conversation . When I came to the Bull I call 'd for Liquor ; what I call 'd for , other People had . There was a Man there that did curse the Pretender ; and I said that I was always taught to bless , and may God bless his Gracious Sovereign Lord King George . Here dropp 'd Loyal and Eloquent Sentiments from Sir Simon Urling Knt . Recorder of the City of London , who spoke to the Prisoner to this Effect : That in the midst of Justice , Mercy was remember 'd ; that he was not then in a Court of Inquisition , but in an open and free Court , where the Liberties of Englishmen are maintain 'd in the highest Degree ; that we had upon the Throne the best of Kings , who had always made the Laws of the Realm the Rule of his Government ; and therefore the Prisoner would do well to have a venerable Regard to his Sacred Majesty King George , and to consider the Mildness of the Court that indicted on him only two Months Imprisonment and a Fine of five Shillings . 34. Barnard Cason , was indicted for stealing a Tea-Kettle , value 5 s. Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 35. Jane Morris and Mary Stafford , were indicted for stealing two Silk Gowns , a Silk Petticoat , & c. and 40 s. in Money , besides some Half-pence , the Goods of Joshua James . Elizabeth James .
