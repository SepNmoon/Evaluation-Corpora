It appear 'd the Prisoner came into Mr. Roger 's House ( the Naggs-Head Tavern in Cheapside ) and went immediately into the Kitchin , and call 'd for a Gill of Wine ; just before which the Cook-Maid had wash 'd the Spoons and other Things , and put them into a convenient Place by the Sink to dry . The Prisoner was extraordinary gay and genteel , and complemented away his Wine to the Cook , and went very often to the Sink under Pretence of making Water ; while the Cook was busied in dressing a Duck for some Company in another Room , which being near ready , before she had Occasion for Spoons to the Sauce , the Prisoner went away : When he was gone , the Spoons were miss 'd immediately ; and the abovemention 'd Circumstances gave Mr. Rogers Reason to suspect the Prisoner , and forthwith sent away his Servants with a Description of him to all the Taverns about , who heard of him twice that Night . At last the Prosecutor became inform 'd of a Coffee House he us 'd , to which he went , and got him in Track and in Essex Street apprehended him , and charg 'd him with the Fact ; at which Time he humbly begged the Prosecutor to go with him into a House , to prevent being insulted by the Populace , and he would make him Satisfaction ; which was complied with , when the Prisoner confess 'd the Fact , and sent one of the Witnesses with a Note to a Woman whom he call 'd his Friend . to recover the Goods which he had sold to a Goldsmith ; which she did , and the Spoons were brought to them . The Goldsmith deposed , the Prisoner ( but he could not be positive to the Man ) brought the Spoons to him to sell , by Candle-light , very well dress 'd , and told him he was his Neighbour and a Gentleman , but short of Money , and being willing to conceal his Misfortunes , brought the Spoons to him in the Dusk of the Evening . Upon this the Goldsmith bought them , and gave him 5 s. and 4 d. an Ounce . The Prisoner in his Defence said , A young Man of his Acquaintance came to him at the aforesaid Coffee-House , and told him his Mother was dead , and had left him some Plate , and desir 'd him ( being better acquainted with the World ) to sell those Spoons for him ; which he refus 'd , but directed him to the said Goldsmith , to whom he went and sold them : That after this , being taken up for some Spoons that were stole , he call 'd to Mind the Marks of those he directed his Friend to sell , and believing they might be the same , discover 'd where they were . There was no Appearance to the Prisoner 's Reputation , nor to the Confirmation of his Story , and the Evidence against him was very full ; upon which the Jury found him Guilty to the Value of 38 s. He was a second time indicted for feloniously stealing 10 Silver Spoons , Value 5 l. out of the House of James Dunton ( at the Greyhound Tavern in Fleetstreet ) in the Parish of St . Brides , on the 14th of December last . It appear 'd , the Prisoner ( as was his usual Method ) came into the Prosecutor 's Kitchin , and call 'd for a Gill of Wine , so gay , that he was taken particular Notice of but not in the least suspected for a Thief . After he was gone , the Spoons were lost out of the Table Drawer ; and Mr. Dunton being inform 'd some Days after , that the Prisoner was in a Neighbour 's House apprehended for such a Fact , went to him with the Drawer that serv 'd him the Gill of Wine , who knew him again very well ; and charging the Prisoner with the Theft , he confess 'd it at last , and told where they were stopp 'd . One Mrs. Riley depos 'd , a little Man like the Prisoner ( but she was not certain of him ) brought her the Spoons to sell ; but she questioning him how he came by them , he ran away and left the Spoons behind him . Her Daughter depos 'd the same , but was positive to the Man . The Prisoner denied the Fact , and endeavour 'd to make his Defence by taking Advantage in Point of Time ; and brought two Witnesses , who swore Mr. Dunton 's Boy gave out , that he saw the Spoons in the Drawer at 7 a Clock that Night , while they were in the Room ( which was after the Prisoner was gone ) upon which Mr. Dunton would have prosecuted them , had not the Prisoner been discover 'd ; but this being of no use towards clearing him of the Fact , and discovering his Innocence , the Jury found him Guilty of this Indictment also .

The Prisoner fir 'd twice at the Servant , who had it in his Power ( his Gun being loaded with small Shot ) to have made a Cullinder of his Scull ; but not knowing the Law , he miss 'd him , and kept a little out of his Way ; whereupon he heard the Prisoner say to the other , D - n is , we 'll kill or be kill 'd ; we wo n't be taken alive : Let 's turn upon them and fire ; our Lives are as good as theirs ; which made him charge his Gun again , and put some Pebble Stones into it , with which he hit the Prisoner behind the Head , who immediately fell down and was taken . The other Highway-man was also taken by another Mr.White , no Relation to the former , who was accidentally upon the Road , and being appris 'd of the Matter , leap 'd over the Ditch and pursued him , with his Hanger drawn : Stephens seeing himself hard put to it , presented two Pistols to him , who thereupon bid him fire , but told him , if he miss 'd , he 'd cleave his Scull ; whereupon , seeing his Companion already taken , he surrendred , and dropt his Pistols . They had two Musquetoons and a Screw Pistol , of a particular Make , and very unfair , one of them being loaded with 3 Bullets , and the others with 2 each . The Prisoner in his Defence said , the Horse was lent him , and to prove it call 'd two Persons , one of which swore , Four Men came in November last to his Inn , where they put up their Horses , and one of them ( which was that mention 'd in the Indictment ) being lame with a Cut on the Knee , one Smith came to him , and desir 'd that a Farrier might be sent for to cure him ; and then they all went away , and left him for that Purpose ; and being cur 'd , Smith 's Brother came and paid for it , and had an Order to deliver the same to the Prisoner ; which was confirm 'd afterwards by the Farrier , who receiv 'd the Money for his Cure . But this making nothing for him , the Court being of the Opinion they were all Accomplices , which the Jury considering , brought him in Guilty of the Indictment . This Desperado , after he was Convicted , was put into the Bail-Dock , it being thought the safest Place for such Persons , since the Murder of Mr. Spurling , in the Hold ; but about 7 a-Clock on Saturday-Night , ( while the Court and the Keepers were employ 'd about another Cause ) with the Assistance of some other Criminals in the same Place , he threw himself over the Spikes into the further Passage , tho ' fetter 'd and made his Escape , before he receiv 'd Sentence . Stevens was admitted to Bail , and not appearing was not tried this Sessions . William Eckersly and William Walton , of the Precinct of St. Katharines , were indicted , Eckersly for feloniously stealing 2 Yards of Shagg , 2 Coats , 1 Wastcoat , several Drawers , Shirts , Handkerchiefs , and other sorts of Slop Goods , from William Jesson , on the 10th Instant ; and Walton as Accessory in receiving the same , knowing them to be stole . The Fact was plainly prov 'd upon Eckersly , who did not deny it at his Trial . It was also prov 'd that Walton did receive the Goods , but he denied he knew them to be stole ; which not being prov 'd to the Jury 's Satisfaction , they acquitted him , but found Eckersly Guilty to the Value of 39 s. [ Branding . See summary . ] Deborah Green of the Parish of St. Paul at Shadwel , was indicted for stealing 1 Worsted Camblet Riding-Hood , Value 10 s. and 17 Shillings in Money , the Goods and Money of Thomas Medcalfe , on the 30th of December last . It appear 'd to be a very trifling Prosecution , and the Jury acquitted the Prisoner . John Moor , of the Parish of Pancras , was indicted for feloniously stealing 1 Black Gelding , Value 20 s. the Good of Francis Hope , on the 6th Instant . Hope depos 'd , That he had turn 'd his Horse loose in the Evening aforesaid , that he might go Home as he us 'd to do , but finding him not there , he enquir 'd after him , and at last heard he was secur 'd in Kentish Town . Another Evidence depos 'd , The Prisoner came to his House , and knock 'd him up , wanting a Lodging ; That going down , he wonder 'd to see a Man with a Sword by his Side upon a Car-man 's Horse with his Harness on , which made him inquire how he came by him ; upon which the Prisoner , who was in Drink , and had been thrown by him into a Pond , answer 'd , D - n him , he found him in Hampstead Road , but he was quite tir 'd of him , and did not care if the Devil had him , so they were parted . The Prisoner , it seems , was a very honest Man , a Trooper , and being in Drink , thought what he did was a very harmless Frolick ; upon which the Jury acquitted him . Jane Collins , of the Parish of St. Dunstan in the West , was indicted for feloniously stealing 1 Silver Tea-Spoon , value 5 s. 1 Tobacco-Box , 5 s. a Gold Ring , and 5 l. in Money , the Goods of Humphry Dearn , on the 28th of December last . Mr. Dearn swore , That while he and his Wife were abroad , the Goods above-mention 'd were stole ; and an ingenious young Woman , who lodg 'd in another Room in the same House , depos 'd , That the Prisoner brought the Case of Drawers ( out of which the Things aforesaid were stole ) to her , desiring it might be lodg 'd there a small Time , because there was not then Room enough in her Son 's Shop , which was over the Way ; and that some Writings ( of Consequence only to the Prosecutor ) was given to her , by a Person in that Shop . The Prisoner called some Witnesses to her Reputation , who giving her a pretty good Character , the Jury acquitted her . Cornelius Ash , of the Parish of St. Mary White-Chappel , was indicted for feloniously stealing 56 Pound Weight of Iron Nails , value 15 s. the Goods of , on the 30th of November last . But there being no Prosecution she was acquitted .

They made no manner of Defence , but a flat Denial ; and the Jury taking the Affair into their Consideration brought H - T - in Guilty of the Indictment , and the two Women of Felony only . [ H- T- : Death . See summary . ] [ Douglass and Nightingale : Branding . See summary . ] Mary Knight and Margaret Hopkins , of the Parish of St. Dunstan at Stepney , were indicted for privately stealing 9 Guineas , and 14 Shillings , from the Person of William Cane , on the 10th of December last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That going home to his Lodging , he met the Prisoner Knight , and ask 'd his Way of her , being a little in Liquor , and not acquainted with the Town ; That she answer 'd him , she was going that Way ; and to oblige him , provided he would make her drink , she would light him home : He complied , and away they went together ; but instead of Home , he found himself conducted to the Ship in Church-lane , where he went to Bed , and was robb 'd . The Prisoners confess 'd the Fact before a Justice , and were both found Guilty of the Indictment . [ Knight : Death . See summary . ] [ Hopkins : Death -respited for pregnancy .
