That then the Gentlemen swore that we should go with them , or they would go with us , saying , they would know who we were , and whether we were going . That while Mr. Hammond was disputing with the Gentlemen , and they were desiring them to go about their Business , Mrs. Maycock looking into Mr. Stanley 's Face , knew him , and said to him , what , Captain , is it you ? and he requiring to know where she was going , was told to Mr. Hammond 's House in the Old Bailey . That then the Prisoner said he was glad he had met with her , and he would go with her , for which she thank 'd him , but telling him there was no Occasion , since Mr. Hammond was there himself to take Care of them . But he being resolute , would go with them ; and being about St. Dunstan 's Church , the Prisoner spoke to the other Gentleman who was with him , and bid him go back to such a Place , and he would come to him presently ; but he not going back , he said to him , why do n't you go , and adding something in a Language unknown to her , which she suppos 'd to be French , he at last did go away , seemingly with the utmost Unwillingness . That then the Prisoner bid Mr. Hammond go before , but he would not ; and the Prisoner went with Mrs. Maycock , and she follow 'd them . That as they were going along , the Prisoner struck a Man he met , and near Fleet-Bridge , a Woman that was crossing the Way : That when they came to the Old Bailey , to Mr. Hammond 's House , they thank 'd the Prisoner for his Civility in waiting upon them home , desir 'd him to go home , but he would not , but would go in , which they endeavoured to disswade him from , saying , Mrs. Maycock was going to stay all Night with a Gentlewoman that was sick , and they had not any Conveniency for his staying ; and that the Deceas 'd rush 'd in , and the Prisoner after her , Mr. Hammond after the Prisoner , and she after Mr. Hammond ; that they went into the Kitchin , where she saw them standing , the Prisoner on one side of the Door , and the Deceased on the other : That soon after Mr. Hammond went into the Yard , and she having pull 'd off her Cloak , and the Head of it , went into the Shop to fetch some Milk she was going to boil for her Supper , but was no sooner got in , and had taken the Milk into her Hand , which was not above the Space of two or three Minutes , before she heard the Deceased cry out , Mrs. Leek , Mrs. Leek , I am stabb 'd , I am murder 'd ; upon which in a Fright , she threw down her Milk , and ran to the Kitchen Door , asking what was the Matter to which the Prisoner reply 'd , nothing : That the Deceased was then standing on one side of the Table , with her Hands cross her Break , looking at the Prisoner with all the Innocence imaginable , and in a little Time fell down on the Ground , and said to her , dear Mrs. Morehen , I am stabb 'd , and the Prisoner on the other side of the Table flourishing his Sword , Swearing , that whatever Man or Woman entered the Room he would kill them ; upon which she fell down on her Knees in the Door Way , entreating both for her own Life , ( he directing the Sword to her Breast ) and that he would permit some Help to come , that what Injury had been done might be repair 'd , and crying out for a Surgeon , Mr. Hammond came in , out of the Yard , but could not enter the Room , she being on her Knees in the Door Way , but afterwards some other Persons coming , and slipping by into the Room , and attempting to disarm the Prisoner , he suffer 'd his Sword to be taken away , and submitted , saying , his Name was John Stanley : That then she ran and fetch 'd Mr. Snowd the Surgeon , who coming in , the Prisoner lay 'd himself over the Deceased , and said , My dear Hannah , wo n't you speak to me ? That Mr. Snowd said to the Prisoner , what , Captain Stanley , will you never have done with these Tricks ? And viewing Mrs. Maycock , said she was dead ; that then they got her up Stairs , cut her Lace , Strings of her Cloathes , & c. and got her to Bed ; that in a little Time after she came to herself , and said she was stabb 'd she was murder 'd she was a dead Woman , and calling upon God for Mercy , died in about an Hour and half after the Wound was given . Mr. Hammond depos 'd much to the same Purpose with Mrs. Morehen , adding , that the Prisoner did not seem to be drunk , but walk 'd very well as they came along . That after they had come in to his House , he having set a Candle in the Kitchin , went into the Yard to the Necessary House , and saw through the Window the Prisoner and Deceased stand leaning near the Window , and talking together friendly , as he thought , but he was no sooner set down on the Vault , but he heard an Outcry of Murder . Whereupon he ran in and saw the Prisoner with his Sword drawn in his Hand , standing upon a Parry , and swearing that if he came into the Room he would kill him , and every one that entered the Room , come as many as wou 'd . That Mrs. Morehen being kneeling in the Door Way , he could not get to him without going over her , so he went to the Shop to get a couple of Broom-sticks , designing first to throw in one at the Prisoner , and so put him in Disorder , and then to rush in and knock down his Sword with the other , but some Women getting into the Room , got hold of him , and he quietly let go his Sword , and said he would do no Harm , that he had kill 'd the Woman , and he must be hang 'd for it . That then they got a Surgeon , and Things afterwards were as Mrs. Morehen had depos 'd . Mrs. Hammond depos 'd , That hearing an Outcry , of Mrs. Leek , Mrs. Leek , I am stabb 'd , and a faint Shriek , she being lame , made what Haste she could down , and slipp 'd in between the Door and the Prisoner , and found the Prisoner with his Sword drawn , and the Deceased on the Ground all bloody ; that she caught hold of the Prisoner 's Arm , as did another Woman , Mrs. Addesey , and took his Sword from him ; and the Prisoner looking on the Deceased , said , I have wounded her , if she be not dead , I hope she will . That he afterwards lay down across the Deceas 'd , and said to her , Dear Hannah , speak to me ; Hannah , for God 's sake speak to me . Then getting up , said , You have been a damn 'd Bitch . That when the Surgeon came in he spoke to the Prisoner , as had been before depos 'd ; and , that looking upon Mrs. Maycock , be said to the Prisoner , I will give you my Word you have done her Business . That he reply 'd , He had had a Child by her that was three Years and a half old , and if Mrs. Maycock was dead , he must die , and the Child should die , and there would be an end of them all . That they sent for the Watch , and the rest was as before depos 'd . Mrs. Addesey depos 'd , That Mrs. Hammond and she coming down upon the Out cry , found the Deceas 'd and Prisoner , as had been before depos 'd , and slipping in by him , and taking hold of his Arm , he deliver 'd his Sword to her . And as for what follow 'd after was as the other Evidences had depos 'd . Mr. Snowd the Surgeon depos 'd to the same purpose , to what the other Evidences had depos 'd . As to his saying to the Prisoner , What , Captain , will you never have done with these Tricks ? That he answered , No . & c. That he found the Wound mortal , and told them , though she did come to her self after having been put to Bed yet she would not live till Morning , though , for Decency sake , he did dress the Wound . The Constable depos 'd , That having apprehended the Prisoner , as he was carrying him to the Watch-house , he swore outragiously , and said , If she was not dead he hop 'd she would be . The Prisoner , in his Defence , deny 'd nothing as to the committing the Fact , nor the Manner of it , but only in Palliation said , That he had had a Child by the Deceas 'd , which was now three Years and a half old , and speaking to her , and upbraiding her with Unnaturalness , in not taking care to make and provide some Clothes for the Child , telling her , his Circumstances were such , that he was now oblig 'd to leave the Kingdom , she ( he suppos 'd ) was provok 'd , that he should speak of it where nothing of it was known , struck him , gave him ill Language , & c. which rais 'd his Passion to give her the Wound , not knowing what he did . He called several Persons , who would have perswaded the Court to look upon him as a Person lunatick . But these Evidences not being satisfactory as to that Point , the Jury found him guilty or both Indictments . Death . After having received Sentence he said , Death was welcome to him , he having been treated so unkindly by his Relations or Friends .

Then they throwed Stones and broke the Lamps at the Crown Tavern Door , and afterwards retreated to the Bonfire . Then some Gentlemen went out of the Tavern , and went as near the Bonfire as they durst to venture , and read the Proclamation , after which they were quiet for some Time ; but afterwards they came up again in a great Body , he thinks some Hundreds , many of them with Clubs and Staves ; and as he was standing at his own Door , some of them came up to him and struck him . Whereupon he retired to the Inside of the Door , and bolted it , then they broke his Windows .

They having continued there about two Minutes , some Gentlemen that were at the Crown Tavern came down , and they went away .

After that another Messengers came up , and said , they had broken Major Adams 's Lamps ; and that several People had been knocked down , and Sticks had been flung into the House .

That the Mob were driven out , and attempting to come in again , he caught hold of a Firelock , and told them , if any Body came in , and attempted to knock any Body down , he would fire at them . That then he went out with a Constable to read the Proclamation , having his Sword drawn to defend him from the Violence of the Mob , and going to Cripplegate , the Gates were shut against them . That the Constable put through his Staff , to shew his Authority , and commanded the Constable , & c. to open the Gates , but he refusing , they went to the Posterns , but they being shut they were obliged to go round through Moorgate , and coming to Cripplegate they read the Proclamation .

That thereupon he asked , if they had read the Proclamation , and was answered , Yes . That the Mob seeming then to be rallying again , he bid them read it again , and if they did not disperse he would go out and help to take some of them ; and , that as the Proclamation was read , they throw 'd Firebrands . That the Mob rallying again , Mr. Adams said to him , For God 's sake do not go away , I am afraid my House will be pull 'd down .

One said to him , There is Lant , who has been heading them all this Night , and was call 'd , the Captain of the Mob . That having said hold of him , Captain Lamb came up , and bid him deliver his Stick , or it should be worse for him , and so as last they wrested it out of his Hand , and carried him to the Crown Tavern . He added , That he heard the Mob cry , Down with them ; Down with the House , & c. Samuel Laurence depos 'd , That he going to the Crown Coffee-house , to speak with a Friend , going into the Passage of the Crown Tavern , a Gentleman that had been with the Gentlemen of the Militia , said to him , Mr. Lawrence , You are a Constable , are you not ? To which he reply 'd , He was . Upon which he desired him not to go away , for that he believ 'd the Mob would be very unruly that Night . That he answered him , He had not his long Staff , and he would not go among them with his short one ; at which Mr. Adams said he would borrow him a Staff , and he did so . And , that at that Time the Mob began to halloo , and gather about the Door . That there was also another Constable present , who had a short Staff . That the Mob growing more unruly , he desired them to go to their Bonfire and be quiet , saying , no Body shall abuse you , or meddle with you , the Aldermen have done Sir John Williams Justice , and no Body shall obstruct you in your Rejoycing . The other Constable had likewise a Staff brought , and in about a Quarter of an Hour they grew very unruly , and threw Stones , and broke the Lanthorns . That then he spoke to them again , saying , Do you know what you do ? That he there saw Lant with a great Stick , flourishing it ; and , as he thinks , going to strike him . After this they grew more violent , and threw Sticks into the Passage ; upon this some Gentlemen , who were in the Tavern Passage , were for going out , but he disswaded them from it , that they might give no occasion or pretence of their being the Aggressors , and none did go out ; and he clapp 'd his Staff cross the Door . That some Persons advised the Reading the Proclamation ; that they went out to read it , but they were so push 'd and shov 'd about that they could not read it ; and he was forc 'd , for fear of being more abus 'd , if not murthered , to withdraw ; but afterwards it was read , and he had his Head broken going to read it ; and the Mob pursed them that had been reading it to the Door , and threw Sticks and Firebrands in very violently , and broke the great Lanthorn to pieces , and pressed so against the Door , which they were attempting to shut , that a great many People could not shut it against them . but they forced their way in , and Mr. Bates was very much wounded . That then being driven out they retired to the Bonfire , and they went to read the Proclamation at the Bonfire that was on the Inside of the Gate , but the Gates were shut , and he put his Staff partly in between them , to show his Authority , but they refus 'd to open the Gate , so they went round , as has been before depos 'd , and there Kits was taken , who said the Constable was a Fool and a Blockhead , for reading the Proclamation .

When they came to the Door they found the Lamps and Windows broken , and heard several had been wounded , and tho ' he spoke to them very civilly , he was forc 'd to retire , and in the Passage he receiv 'd 4 or 5 very Severe Blows , Stones and Sticks being flung in as thick as Hail ; that then there came some Gentlemen down Stairs , and forc 'd them to retire ; that he saw Lant with them at the Tavern Door , when he was going out to read the Proclamation , which was done without making any Disturbance ; and that they had assaulted the House before this Time . Being ask 'd by the Council for the Prisoners , whether there had not Men gone out with Swords , Muskets , and Bayonets ? He reply 'd , there were 2 went with Swords , and 2 with Muskets , to defend the Person that read the Proclamation . Daniel Frazier depos 'd much to the same Effect , adding . That after the Proclamation was read the second Time , the Mob came up in a Body to Major Adam 's House , and there was a hot Dispute , they throwing Sticks , Stones , and Fire-brands ; and that the Proclamation was read three or four Times . That he saw one of the Prisoners there , which he thinks was Ayres , and Lant was flourishing his Stick without the Gate , and was call 'd the Captain of the Mob . Mr. Jones depos 'd , That he having had the Misfortune to be in the Scrutiny for Mr. Feast , upon the Day mentioned in the Indictment the Mob came to his House about 7 a-Clock in the Evening with great Clubs , and in a violent Manner broke his Shutters , and at that Time he saw Ayres among them . John Pickard depos 'd , That he saw a great Mob about the Castle Tavern , who cry 'd , down with the Rump . Lockwood and Williams for ever no King George ; that at Cripplegate there was the same Cry of Lockwood and Williams for ever , and they made him pull of his Hat , at their Outcry ; that they also cry 'd out , No King George several times . That there were then about 200 , and he saw Ayres there , with a Stick in his Hand . That going to the Crown-Tavern , he saw Lant the Carman there , with a great Mob of 150 , or more , and their Cry was at the Door of the Crown-Coffee House , Down with the Rump , Down with the House , and at the Crown Tavern a great Stick was thrown , which miss 'd him , and hit some body else ; and afterwards they came up with great Violence , and several Persons were knock 'd down and beaten in an unmerciful manner . Daniel Quarles depos 'd , That he living at the Crown-Coffee House , went out , and coming Home about a quarter of an Hour before Mr. Jones 's Windows were broke , saw a violent Mob , who cry 'd out , Down with the Roe-buck Coffee-House , Down with the Roe-buck Tavern ; that thus they went their Rounds , and Lant was there flourishing his Stick about over his Head . Mr. Power depos 'd , That being near the Crown-Tavern , about 9 a Clock , he saw a great Mob , and he desir 'd them to disperse , and they cry 'd , Knock him down , and they did so ; that they were near 200 ; that they cry 'd out , No King George , No Hannoverian Proclamation , when the Proclamation was read ; that they cry 'd , Down with the House ; and that he saw Lant there . Jonathan Woodley depos 'd , That he being at the Crown-Tavern , the House was assaulted , and he being desired to assist in saving the House from being pull 'd down , receiv 'd a desperate Wound on the left side of his Forehead , which laid his Skull bare , so that he was two Months under the Surgeons Hands . The Mark of which he show 'd in Court . Mr. Ambrey depos 'd , That he being drinking with Company at the Crown-Tavern , a Person came up and said , Mr. Jones 's House had been assaulted . Some time after they had News brought them , that they were breaking the Windows of the Crown-Coffee-House , and afterwards Major Adams came up , and told them , his House was assaulted , and desir 'd them to come down ; that he saw the Glasses broke : That the Proclamation was read , and they sat down again to drink . That afterwards Major Adams 's Porter was brought in wounded , and he dress 'd him . Then Mr. Woodley was brought in wounded very dangerously , him Skull being laid bare , and he took a Splinter of Wood out of the Wound ; and he was also very much bruised ; and that Mr. Merry and others were also brought in wounded , to the Number of six or eight .

The Council for the Prisoners were , Mr. Hungerford and Mr. Kettleby ; who during the Course of the Evidence for the King , were not wanting in cross-examining the Evidences for the King ; and so also in the Defence of their Clients spar 'd no Pains or Rhetorick to clear them of the Charge of a Riot , by laying it upon their Accusers , which they attempted to do by the following Evidences . Mr. Kelpin depos 'd , That he liv 'd at the House which is over Cripplegate , and that he look 'd out of the Window , and they lighted a Fire on the Inside of the Gate , and there was no Disturbance ; and then they lighted another Fire over against the Castle-Tavern , and cry 'd out , King George for ever , and Sir John Williams , and they took a Walk round about , without any Disturbance ; and at last there was a Company of Captains of the Train 'd Bands , who made them run away , and they kick 'd the Bonfire abroad , and went into the Tavern again , and then they lighted it again , and cry 'd , King George for ever ; and then the People came out of the Tavern again , and then the Fray began . That they had Guns and Bayonets , to the Number of 4 or 5 , and Swords waving , and they were the Cause of the Riotous Doings . That he saw them come out twice , and fell upon them , and they ran away like Sheep . That he heard no manner of Noise , but at the Crown-Tavern , and he did not see that they went there ; but he believ 'd they at the Crown-Tavern were the Transgressors . Joseph Jude depos 'd , That about 10 a Clock , having been drinking thereabouts , he saw Men in Scarlet and Buff kicking the Bonfire about , and one of them was Captain Stray ; and that another Captain came out , shaking his Sword , who he heard was call 'd Capt . Lamb , and he swore they should have no Bonfire ; that when they were gone , the People put the Bonfire together again , and he saw the Men in Scarlet drawing up to dislodge them ; that he clapp 'd his Back against Bates 's Window , and they came towards them , and met them , and the Red-Coat Men were forc 'd to retire . But in two Minutes time came out with their Bayonets in their Muskets , ten or a dozen of them , but he could not tell whether or no there had been any thing done at the Crown-Tavern before . - Worsley depos 'd , That he saw no Disturbance till it was almost 9 a Clock ; that some Persons came out of the Crown-Tavern and cry 'd , King George for ever ; that one had a drawn Sword , that they kick 'd out the Bonfire , they about it running away ; but afterwards came and put it together , and ran round it , and cry 'd , King George for ever , and Sir John Williams ; That he saw Gentlemen in Scarlet , and Granadiers between the Conduit , and they cry 'd , Fire , and one did fire , and there was a Fray . He could not tell whether there were 4 or 5 with Fire-Arms , but he could not say that none of the Bonfire-People had been at the Crown Tavern before this . John Ridgley depos 'd , That he was at his Door , about four Yards from the Bonfire , and they were dancing about it ; and there came out twelve or fourteen Soldiers out of the Crown Tavern , some with Swords drawn ; and Captain Stray pok 'd the Fire about with his Sword in the Scabbard , and swore , He could not bear to see the Fire . But when the Men in Buff and Scarlet were gone , and retir 'd to the Crown Tavern again , they at the Bonfire pick 'd up the Sticks and put it together ; and , that they never went near the Crown Tavern , that he saw ; and , that the Soldiers were half of them drunk , and he thought they would have kill 'd one another , for they had a great Mob of their own Party , and at last they came out and fought ; then the Mob at the Fire met them , and then the Soldiers run away , and retired to the Tavern , and shut the Tavern Door ; and there was none about the Bonfire but Women and Children . Samuel Gray depos 'd , That the Bonfire was lighted about duskish , and he stay 'd at the Castle Tavern , and there were about twenty or thirty that went round the Bonfire very quietly ; then a Party of the killing Captains sallied out of the Crown Tavern and came to the Bonfire , and kick 'd the Fire about , all that were about the Fire being gone away ; and then having vapour 'd round it , they went to the Crown Tavern again . And when the People were got round the Fire again , Men in Scarlet and Buff came out again with about seven or eight Guns , and two Swords drawn , and the Bonfire People met them , and the Captains ran away first , and then they came out again and read a Proclamation , about ten or twelve Words , and then it wanted about a Quarter of an Hour of eleven a Clock . And the Gate was shut , and they went round . John Benson depos 'd , He saw two Gentlemen in Scarlet , one with his Sword drawn , and another with his in the Scabbard , and eight or ten with Sticks , they about the Fire being run away , they push 'd the Fire about , but he did not know where they came from . They retired thro ' Cripplegate , and by and by there came out four or five with Muskets , and the Gates were shut . Moses Wilson depos 'd , That he heard a following , saw a Bonfire , and a great Company of People gathered together about the Crown Tavern Door , and the People were hurrying about in the Crown Coffee-house . That some Gentlemen in Scarlet came out with Swords drawn in their Hands , and walk 'd towards the Bonfire . That those at the Bonfire drew up towards them , but seeing their Swords drawn they ran away , and they demolish 'd the Bonfire . Then the Gentlemen went in to the Crown Tavern again , and in half a Quarter of an Hour he saw two Mobs a fighting cross the Kennel , near the Tavern Door , and they made up to the Crown Tavern , and he heard Windows break . Mr. Battin depos 'd , That he saw Captain Stray come out at the Head of his Granadiers , and they threw the Bonfire about : and there were some with Constables Staves . That there was one Sword drawn , and one in the Sheath , the Mob ran away , and they kick 'd the Bonfire about , and then went into the Crown Tavern again , after which the People return 'd , and put the Bonfire together again . That some came out with Bayonets and Muskets , made a halt , and cry 'd , Fire , and the Bonfire People ran away , and they came and read the Proclamation ; and , that the Soldiers made the Battle . That they went to go through the Gate to read the Proclamation ; and this was about Nine a Clock . Mrs. Brown depos 'd , That she saw it from the Beginning to the End . That they made a Bonfire , and rejoyc 'd about it , and when it was about half burnt out , two or three came in Red Coats , and one with his Sword drawn , and one said , There should be no Bonfire . One of them was Captain Stray , and they put the Bonfire out , and went into the Tavern again , and stay 'd there about half an Hour , and in the mean Time the People put the Bonfire together again . And afterwards the Captains , and Men in Caps , and two or three in red Coats , came to the Bonfire , and said , There should be no Bonfire . And there was hardly any Body at it but Boys and Girls , and they threw it about , and one Stick of Fire lay in the Front of the Passage of the Crown Tavern . That a Man came by , and said , What do you throw the Fire about for ? And kicked the Billet , and it broke Adam 's Lanthorn . That the Soldiers stood in the Passage of the Tavern , and there was a Fight there , and then they went about to take whom they could ; and , that there had been no Assault upon the Crown Tavern , before they had been out twice , and there had been one Gun let off . Mr. Howard , a Constable , depos 'd , The Beadle came about half an Hour after nine a Clock to him , and told him , That the Soldiers came out of the Crown Tavern , and kicked the Bonfire about , and he believed there would be a Quarrel . That he went to Cripplegate , and the Bonfire had been kick 'd about , and they were making it up again . That there was a great running through the Gate , and there were Persons in Scarlet Coats , and there was knocking down of People . That he saw one with his Piece levelled to shoot ; that he commanded the King 's Peace ; that he saw Captain Stray there , and that another came with his Sword drawn , and he thereupon commanded the Gates to be shut . This being the Substance of the Evidence , as to the Fact , the Prisoners call 'd Witnesses as to their particular Persons . As to Kite , some Evidences appear 'd , who depos 'd , That he had been drinking from about five , and was with them till half an Hour past ten . As to Ayres , one Witness depos 'd , That she saw him about another Bonfire at the three Tuns in Woodstreet till half an Hour past 10 a Clock , and he was taken up by 11 . As to Ambler , That he was much in Liquor at five in the Afternoon . And another Evidence , That she parted with him between nine and ten a Clock in Forestreet . As to Lant , There were several Evidences who spoke as to him ; but none that could prove him not there at the Times of these Attacks ; and one insisted , That Lant told him , he was employed by Mr. Willis Constable to aid and assist him in keeping the Peace . Upon this Mr. Willis was call 'd , who depos 'd , That being at a publick House , he heard of a great Disturbance , about seven or eight a Clock ; that Mr. Jones 's House was assaulted , that he went , and they said , those that assaulted Mr. Jones 's House were gone . That he afterwards saw Lant among the Mob ; said he was sorry to see him there , advised him to go home , and gave him half a Quartern of Brandy to do so . and , that he did afterwards charge him to aid and assist him , but he could not keep him in his fight for above two or three Minutes , and afterwards he heard he was taken up . Being ask 'd , for what reason he charg 'd him to and and assist him ? He reply 'd , To keep him from running into Mischief . The Course of the Evidence , on both sides , being finished , and the Council for the Prisoners having made their Remarks upon them , Mr. Attorney General reply 'd , That as to the Evidences for the King , they were Persons of Reputation ; which had no wise been impeached , or called in Question . That they were to the Number of ten or twelve ; who were uniform in their Evidence . That they being generally there upon the Spot at the very beginning of the Riot , and where the Injuries were done ; and many of them had suffer 'd great Damage , they must of necessity be able to give a more exact Account , than those Persons , who ; some came by accidentally , some stood at a Distance , and some saw through Windows , and some saw one part ; and others another ; and , as it appear 'd , not one of them the whole ; so that their Evidence must needs be imperfect , and perplex 'd as to Time , scarce one of them speaking to any Thing that was done before nine a Clock , when it appear 'd by several Evidences for the King , that the Disturbance was begun before eight a Clock . The Judge having summ 'd up the Evidence on both sides , the Jury went out , and after a short stay , found John Lant guilty of the Misdemeanor , and acquitted Richard Ayres , David Kite , and John Ambler . The next Morning the Council : for the Prisoners mov 'd the Court in Arrest of Judgement , insisting upon two or three Points of Law , which were disallow 'd by the Court ; but upon their urgent requesting for a Respite , did adjourn the Court till Thursday , the 12th Instant .
