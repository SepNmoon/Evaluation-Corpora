It is directed to my Wife , and contains Threatnings to murder her if she did not leave 4 l. in a Place therein mentioned . I left a Bag of Shot in the Place , and set a Watch , but could not make any Discovery . The Boy ( the Prisoner ) had some Relations in the Neighbourhood , and used to be lurking there abouts . At last upon some Quarrel between his Cousin and another Woman , I heard that he was in Newgate , and that this Letter was of his writing . Upon this , I went to him and shew 'd him the Letter , and asked him if he knew it . He said , Yes , very well , for he wrote it himself , and he was to have half the Money , and these People ( John and Hester Robinson ) were to have the other half . For Mrs. Penson , in Silvuer-Street , Bloomsbury-Market , Feb. 30 . Mrs. Penson if you dont put four Pound within your Rails by your Bones by God we will burn you and your Family down to the Ground dam our Sols if we dont by ten a Clock and if you set a Watch the furst time we Litt of you we will murder you dam our Eyes if we dont put the Munnuy We will murder you by God by us J.H Im TG TH .

Hester Robinson . The Day before this Letter was sent , I saw the Prisoner writing a Letter - I have seen him write before , and I believe this Letter to be his Hand - Jonathan Horn . This Woman Hester Robinson told me that the Prosecutor had been with her several times , and offer 'd her two or three Guineas to swear against the Boy . Ann Horn . And she said the same to me . Robinson . He never offer 'd me a Penny to swear any thing but the truth - As for these People , they threatned what they would do to me if I appeared against the Boy . John Grant . Hearing that Hester Robinson had been at Hick 's Hall , I asked her if she had sworn against the Boy , and she said , yes , but not to hurt him , for she knew of no Letter ; that she durst do no other than swear against him ; and that Penson had offer 'd her five Guineas to swear away the Boy 's Life . I have known the Boy four or five Years , and never heard any thing unhandsome of him ; and therefore I hope the honourable Gentlemen will allow the Law to be suborned and the Blood to be bought when the whole Neighbourhood cry out shame of the Prosecutor for prosecuting the Boy in such an innocent manner - Innocent ? Yes , is it not an innocent thing to take a Man 's Blood for Money ? Robinson . This Man came to my Room boldly , and asked me if I had been to Hicks 's Hall to swear against the Prisoner .

My Hat was beat off in the Fray , and I saw the Prisoner take it up and carry it away . Prisoner . How can you be sure that I took it when several others were there ? Parr .

The last time was about five o'Clock when his Wife bid him make haste : And he answered , I 'll be ready for ye , and I warrant ye I 'll do your Business .

They were all taken at Huntington . John Hardwick . I live at Huntington . The Prisoner 's passing thro ' the Town , I was told that they were suspected Persons , they having been seen at Godmanchester with a great deal of Money , and could give no good account how they came by it . Upon which , I and four more pursued 'em on Horse-back , and overtook them by a Wood side , out of the Road . We brought 'em back to an Ale-house , where Byrne took me aside and told me that his two Companions were Irish Rogues who had persuaded him to rob his Brother in Law , and had lent him a Pair of Shoe-makers Pincers to break the Chest open . They were carried before the Mayor of Huntington . Byrne had these Buck-skin Breeches on ; these three Silver Spoons , and the Money in this Paper which is 30 l. 1 s. 6 d. were found in his Pocket ; in this other Paper is 4 l. 10 s. which was taken from Bateman ; and 5 l. 11 s. which is in this Paper , was found upon Clark .

When I had done it , I went and told them directly , and gave them two Guineas to fetch their Cloaths out of pawn from George Stringer 's , in Drury Lane - They told me they would carry me to Dublin where I should live without working ; and they persuaded me to marry a Common Woman at the Fleet - They had between them 26 l. of the Money that I took from my Brother . Court . It appears that Clark and Bateman , were not Principals but Accessary 's in this Fact .

Mary Pippin . The Goods were stolen out of my Kitchen about seven o'Clock on Thursday Night . I went to Martha Daniel a Pawnbroker and offer 'd to pay whatever they were pawn 'd for . She said she had none of them , this was on the Tuesday following , and three Weeks afterwards a strange Man came and asked me if I had not lost such a Suit of Gray . I told him , Yes . And then he told me , The Cloaths are pawn 'd for a Guinea , and you must give me a Guinea before you see them or the House where they be . I gave him the Money . Then he carried me to the House of the Prisoner Martha Daniel , and she shew 'd me the Cloaths , and said she had them at eight o'Clock the same Night that I lost them ; I asked her why she did not let me have them when I first enquired for them and offer 'd her the Money .

Pippin . She has sworn falsly , for she was in the Shop when I went to enquire for the Goods . I asked her if she had not taken in such Things , and she said she did not know , but she would ask her Mistress . And so she called her Mistress into the Shop . Do you know , says her Mistress , in whose Name the Things were pledged . No , says I , for to tell you the Truth they were stolen . M. Pattison . My Mistress afterwards order 'd me to stop Wardlow the next time he came , and so I did when he came to pawn a Black Suit . The Jury found Wardlow guilty , and acquitted Daniel .

John Lewis . I and my Partner Isaac Hawkins live in Petty France . The Prisoner was our Servant . The Night before the Robbery I came home between twelve and one , and found her in her Scarlet Cloak and Black Hood . I asked her if she had been out , she at last owned that she had , but said she had been at home above an Hour , but happened to fall asleep . Mr. Hawkins came home after me and was in a great Passion with her , for he said he had been at the Door before and knock 'd several times but could not get in ; and therefore he told her she should stay in the House no longer . She desired me to pacify him , and let her stay two or three Days , because she was not provided with a Lodging . We at last agreed to this , and the next Night he and I went to sup at Mrs. Pattisons , a Snuff-Shop in Great Queen Street . Mr. Hawkins took the Key of the Street Door with him that the Prisoner might not go out again and leave the House . About eleven o'Clock she came to us , and said , the Silver Tea Pot was lost . God send that nothing else may be lost , says I , and so we went home and found the Street Door lock'd- The Lock goes with a Spring , so that she could make it fast without the Key , by pulling it after her when she came out . We found our Box and Drawers broke open , and mist the Goods and Money . We searched all the House , and look 'd up the Chimnies in every Room but could see no body . We went up to the Garret where she lay . Her Door was lock 'd and the Key without side . We went in and found her Box shut , and so were the Windows , and nothing out of order . We examin 'd her , and told her that she must have a hand in this . She said she knew nothing of it , but that she had been out to drink Tea with Mrs. Needham , a Mantua Maker in the Neighbourhood , and had left the Door upon the Latch . She went down into the Kitchen , and as she was coming up again , she call 'd out , Mr. Lewis , for God 's sake come here ! They have begun to fire the House , and it 's God 's Mercy we were not all burnt . I went down , and she shewed me a place on the Kitchen Stairs where the Board was burnt . I felt it was hot , upon which I told her it must be her doing since we came home , for if it had been done before , it would have been cold . But all that she said to this was , Do you think I would be such a Beast ? Then we locked her up in her own Garret , and in a little time she cryed out For God 's sake come up . I went to see what was the matter ; she said that she had been robbed too . Her Box was then open and so was the Garret Window . She looked out of the Window with the Candle , and said , the Thieves must be gone that way . She told us she had lost two Gowns and a Holland Shirt . But we afterwards found that she had sent those Gowns to pawn . Pawnbroker . A Man pledg 'd these Gowns with me in the name of John Taylor , on the twenty first of January , and he said they were his Wife 's . Mrs. Needham . An Hour after the Robbery , the Prisoner brought these Gowns to Mrs. Burt 's , at whose House I then was , and said , the House was robb 'd , and she had brought the Gowns for fear they should be lost too . Mrs. Burt . The Prisoner had been drinking Tea with us three Quarters of an Hour , and then she went home , and in an Hour 's time she came again with her Gown , and said , the House had been robb 'd - I went to see her when she was in the Gate house , and she bid me pawn the Gowns in the name of John Taylor , and so I sent my Husband with them . Mr. Lewis . Hearing the Gowns were at Burt 's House , I asked her about them , and she said they were pawn 'd in the Prisoner 's Name . Mrs. Burt . So they were at first . But when her Name was advertised I was afraid they might be stopt , and so I fetch 'd them out , and sent them again in the Name of John Taylor . Needham . The Prisoner told me she had a Sweet-heart whose Name was Wilson ; that he was a Widower , and a Surgeon , and had 100 l. a Year at Windsor , but at present was a Prisoner in the Fleet , That he had a great many fine Cloths that had been his Wife 's , in pawn . That his Cause was to be try 'd at the opening of the Parliament , and he wanted two or three Hundred Pounds to get himself clear , and then he would marry her . And she desired me about two Months before the Robbery to write a Love Letter to him , which I did . When I went to see her in the Gate-house , a vile Fellow said to me , Ye Bitch if you offer to be an Evidence against her I 'll get somebody to swear your Life away . Prisoner . Mrs. Needham came and asked me to drink Tea with her ; I told her I could not leave the House , because my Master had got the Key , but I put the Lock back and left the Door upon the Latch , and went with her . She having no Fire , we both went to Mrs. Burts in the Broad Way . I staid three Quarters of an Hour , and then returning , I found the Door ajar . The first thing I mist was the Tea Pot which I had left on the Table , upon which I run up in a fright , and fetch 'd my Gowns and Cloak and carried them to Mrs. Burt 's , Lord , says I , If Mr. Lewis has not been at home and bid the Tea Kettle to frighten me , the House has been robb 'd and I am ruin 'd . Then I went to Queen-Street , where my Masters were , and acquainted 'em with it . They went home and I followed them directly , and going down Stairs , I found some Tinder that seemed to be on fire on the Stairs , upon which I called and shewed it them . Then going up to Bed I mist my Cloaths , and being in a great fright , I forgot I had carried them out , and thought I had been robb 'd . The Night before there being no Coals to make a Fire , I asked them to send for some , but they said there was no occasion , for they were going out and should not be back till twelve o'Clock . When they were gone there being nothing in the House but a bit of Cheese , I went out to get something for Supper . Mr. Lewis . There was three Ribs of a Neck of Mutton , and half a Cheese , besides Bread . Prisoner . It being cold when I came home I sat up in my Cloak and Hood . Mr. Lewis came in at twelve , and Mr. Hawkins at two , and he was in a great Passion , and said he had been twice at the Door and could not get in . Several in whose Families the Prisoner had been a Servant gave her a very good Character , and the Jury acquitted her . 18.

Next Morning I looked out for a Chap , and met with Mrs. Leadbeater in Leather-lane , and sold her part of the Goods for 30 s. and bid her come to my Mother 's to see the rest .
