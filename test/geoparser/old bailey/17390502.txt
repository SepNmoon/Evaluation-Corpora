William Kirkwood , of St. John the Evangelist , wa indicted , for that he , not having God before his Eyes , March the 10th , in and upon James Hunt , did make an Assault ; and with both his Hands , the said Hunt , on the Breast , Head , Face , Stomach , Sides and Back , did strike and beat , & c. and on the Ground did cast and throw , giving to him the said Hunt , as well by striking , & c. as by casting him to the Ground , & c. several mortal Wounds and Bruises , of which from the 10th of March to the 17th , at the Parish above-mentioned , and at St. Margaret 's , Westminster , he languished , and languishingly lived , and then dy 'd . He was a Second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest . Hannah Ladyman . The Prisoner at the Bar came into our House with his Fellow-Servant , to drink a Pot of Beer ; when the Reckoning was to be paid , the Prisoner desired his Companion to lend him a Penny . The Deceased said , damn you , he sha'n't lend you a Penny . Why would you impose upon the Man ? The Prisoner said , he did not want to impose upon him , he only desired him to lend him a Penny , and would give it him again . Damn you , says the Deceased , he shall not lend you a Penny . The Prisoner then asked the Deceased if he could not keep his own Company ? Upon which the Deceased damn 'd his Body and Eyes , and said he would lick him . The Prisoner told him , he did not want to be concerned with him . But , says the Deceased , damn you I will give it you ; - I wo n't make a Disturbance in the House , but I 'll go out into the Street , and wait for you ; if I wait all Night I 'll do your Business , and he accordingly paid Two-pence , and went out of the House . The Prisoner staid in the House half an Hour after the Deceased was gone , and then he went out . Presently I heard a great Noise in the Street , and found them fighting , but I did not see the Beginning of the Battle . This was on a Saturday , and after the Battle was over , the Deceased came into the House , and said , - damn his Eyes and Body , - he would fight him again on Monday Morning . Prisoner 's Q . Did I give him any Affront ? Ladyman . No ; none at all , but desired the Deceased to be quiet and easy . I never saw the Prisoner behave any otherwise than quietly and civilly . John Grace . I saw them both in the Publick House , but I ca n't say how the Quarrel began : And I saw them afterwards fighting in the Street , but I ca n't tell which of them struck first . There was a Cut on the Deceased 's Head , and there was Blood upon them both . Thomas Davis . I saw them fighting in the Street ; they were both bloody , and had several Falls , and Blows pass 'd on both Sides . The Deceased had a Cut on his Head , which I believe was occasioned by a Fall on the Stones . Mary Wimpers gave much the same Account . Catherine Geary . The Deceased came Home that Saturday Night , in Liquor ; ( as I was inform 'd . ) The next Morning he complained of his Hip , and Side . His Eyes and Face were black ; and he said he had been fighting . I asked him if he was not a Fool , to come off by the worst ? Well , says he , if I am better , I will do for him again . He fought on the Saturday , and died the next Saturday . Hester Holt . The Deceased was brought to our Workhouse , as a Man ill of a Fever , ( in a deplorable Condition ) on Friday . Catherine Jones . The Deceased was my Brother . I went to see him while he was ill , and ask 'd him how his Illness came ; he told me , - by Fighting ; upon which I turn 'd down the Bed-cloaths , and saw his Neck , Shoulders , Side and Elbow sadly bruised and morrify 'd . I ask 'd him , who he had fought with ; he said , - with an Irishman , - the Prisoner at the Bar ; that he was helping to unload four Loads of Beer , and the Prisoner was to give him 6 d. but when the Work was done he would give him but 2 d. so they went to Fighting . Mr. Westbrook , ( Surgeon . ) The Deceased was sent to the Work-house , as a Person in a Fever ; at the Time of his coming there , he was senseless and delirious . After his Death , the Body was open 'd , and there were several Marks of Violence upon it : He had been very much bruised , and the Bruises might hasten his Death ; for he was in an ill State , his Bowels were bad , and his Body was very morbid . In all Probability he could not have liv 'd but a little Time longer . William Topliff . I was drinking that Evening with the Prisoner , and when he came to pay the Reckoning , he desired me to lend him a Penny , to prevent his changing a Shilling . The Deceased call 'd the Prisoner a Black-guard Dog , for spunging upon a Man , when he saw he was in Liquor , and said , He deserv 'd to have his Brains knock 'd out : I told him , he was not able to knock the Prisoner 's Brains out . After the Deceased had declared , he would fight the Prisoner , he went out ; and in about ten Minutes afterwards , I went out , and the Prisoner follow 'd me . As soon as I got into the Street , the Deceased struck me down : I lay some Minutes ; and the first Thing I saw when I was recover 'd and got up , was the Deceased naked , fighting with the Prisoner , who had his Cloaths on . I was knock 'd down , so ca n't tell who struck the first Blow . Charles Hanford . I was drinking in the House where the Quarrel began , but did not mind what Words pass 'd . The Deceased went out first , and waited for the Prisoner 's coming out . Topliff , ( the last Witness ) went out next ; the Deceased struck him ; and the Prisoner coming out , he ( the Deceased ) struck him too , and they fell to fighting . People were going to part them , and the Prisoner would have left off , but the Deceased would fight again , and ran after the Prisoner ; then they fought again , and the Deceased had a Fall , after which he ran after him to fight again , but the Prisoner ran away from him . Evan Williams saw the Prisoner coming out of the House , and stopp 'd to speak to him . While he was talking to him , the Deceased came up , and pull 'd off his Cloaths , saying , - He would fight the best [ Man ] of them : He advised him to go home , and told him , he was not able to fight ; the Prisoner told him , he was going home , and did not want to fight , but the Deceased stripp 'd , and would fight ; upon which the Witness told him , If he would fight , he must , and so he [ the Witness ] went about his Business . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and found that Hunt dy 'd a natural Death . 235. Anne Hayes was indicted for stealing 7 s. and 6 d. the Money of Philip Box , from the Person of Eleanor his Wife , Mar 4 . Guilty , 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 236.

Margery Akers for receiving the same ; knowing it to be stole , Apr 2. William Hutchinson . On the 2d of April I was coming by Spring Gardens , at the Bottom of the Park , pretty much in Liquor , and I met with the Prisoner Barnes , and another Woman not taken ; I went with them to the George Tavern in Spring Gardens , and from thence to the Cross Keys in St. Martin 's Lane ; while we were there , Barnes came and sat in my Lap , and took my Watch : I felt it in my Pocket just before , but I miss 'd it presently after she had sat in my Lap , and I told the Prisoner I had lost it ; upon which she went to the other Woman , and that other Woman ran away ; so I laid hold of the Prisoner ; and afterwards , upon making Enquiry after my Watch , this Evidence [ Watkins ] brought it to me . James Watkins . The Prisoner Akers lives in Lumley Court in the Strand ; I happen 'd to be with a Friend next Door to Akers 's , and she ( Akers ) came in , and enquired for George Groves , and said , she wanted to get this Watch pawn 'd . Groves happen 'd not to be at Home , so she gave it me , and went with me to the Rose in Long Acre ; we both went in , and she asked three Guineas upon it , the Pawnbroker would lend but two ; then she said , he must let her have Two Guineas and a half . He refused , and we were at the Door coming away ; but at last she turned about and took the two Guineas . The next Morning I informed the Prosecutor that his Watch was pawn 'd ; he gave me Money to redeem it , and I returned it to him . This is the Watch . Hutchinson . This is the Watch I lost : Watkins . I had heard that Mr. Hutchinson had lost his Watch , and by going sometimes to Akers 's House , I saw it ; she shewed it me , and said , that was the Watch . She had been talking to me several Times before about it , though I do n't know how she came to do it , for I had no Concern in it , - no , none at all . I heard her say , Mr. Hutchinson had been robbed of his Watch , and that this was the Watch . Prisoner Akers . Ask him whether he did not come to my House and call for a Pint of Wine , and not having Money to pay for it , whether he did not pull out the Watch himself , and desire me to go with him to pawn it , that he might pay me a Shilling for the Wine , and another Shilling for lying in my House all Night ? Watkins . She shewed me the Watch , and went with me to pawn it , for Fear the Pawnbroker should refuse to take it in from me . She herself asked the Pawnbroker to lend her the Money upon it . Mr. Fraser . This Woman ( Akers ) keeps a most notorious House , in the Parish of St. Martin 's in the Fields ; a Harbour for Thieves . She was brought before me , she made no Manner of Defence . Hutchinson . She owned before the Justice , that she received the Money for the Watch , and was very sorry for it . James Chapman . I was in Akers 's House about a Month ago , and the Evidence [ Watkins ] came in , and told her , he wanted a Trifle of Money ; and if she would lend him a little Matter upon a Watch , he said , he would pay her the Rent which was due to her , from a Friend of his who lodged in a House which she rented at next Door . She refused to lend him Money upon it , ( I believe she had none to lend , ) but she agreed to go with him to a Pawnbroker 's , and I staid in the House till she and the Prisoner came back ; and then I heard her say , the young Fellow has pawned the Watch for two Guineas in Long-Acre . He did not stay 3 Minutes in the House before they both went out , in order to pawn it . Akers keeps a private House , but I have often drank Punch there , and the Evidence drank something when he came back , I did not see him drink any thing before . Akers . He had two Pints of Wine before we went out with the Watch ; I had nine Shillings out of the Money he received at the Pawnbroker 's , which was due to me from George Groves , a Footman , who is an Acquaintance of Watkins . Watkins . I never saw this Man ( Chapman ) in the House , nor have I ever drank with him : Both Acquitted . 239. Abraham Nash was indicted for assaulting Daniel King on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Pair of Leather Shoes , value 2 s. and 4 s. 5 d. in Money , April 12 . Daniel King . On the 12th of April , between Ten and Eleven o'Clock , I was going from the Talbot Inn in the Strand , with a Basket in my Hand , towards Kensington ; and between Knights-Bridge and The Half-way House , I saw two Men about a hundred Yards from me . The Moon shone bright , and they both passed by me about a Foot . Then the Prisoner turned about and came on my Left Hand ; the other on my Right . The Prisoner struck me with the But End of this Pistol on the Stomach ; the other laid his Pistol on the Ground , about two Feet from me , and then he kneelled down , and pulled off my Shoes ; the Buckles he gave me again , and said , damn you , take them again , - they are good for nothing . Then he pulled off my Breeches , and turned them inside out . The Prisoner demanded my Watch ; I told him I had none . Then they damned me , and asked me the Reason why my Breeches Pockets were sewed up ? I told them there was some Money in one of the Pockets , and they searched it , and took from thence three Shillings , two Six-pences , and about Five-pence Half-penny , or Six-pence , in Copper . Then they searched my Basket , and turned the Straw out of it , but hearing some People coming up , they both ran away . My Face was then towards Kensington , so I turned about to follow them , but my Breeches being about my Heels I could not run ; but as the Moon shone very bright , I could see them run , 'till they were fifty Yards from me . I saw the Prisoner 's Face , and am positive to him ; he had a Handkerchief about his Neck , and the same blue and white Striped-Waistcoat that he has on now : His Hat was cocked , and his Cap was pulled a little over his Eyes , but he was so near me , that I could see his Face very plain . As I followed them , crying , Stop Thief ! - I am robbed ! Mr. Evans met me , and asked me what was the Matter ! I told him I had been robbed of my Shoes , and the little Money I had about me , by two Men . A Woman coming by told me , one of them had run down a narrow Passage , not far off ; but I said , as I had saved my Life , I would make the best of my Way Home , and would borrow a Pair of Shoes at the Half Way House . When I had got within a hundred Yards of that House , I met with Mr. Gilpin , who asked me what made me go so uneasy ? I told him I had been robbed , I described the Men to him , and went directly Homewards ; so I ca n't tell how the Prisoner was taken . Thomas Colcot . My Brother , my Apprentice , and I were coming from Kensington , on Thursday , April 12 , between ten and eleven o'Clock at Night , and between the Half-Way House and Kensington , we met the Prosecutor , and two Men with him . I said , - King ! What the Devil do you do without your Shoes ! Why , I have been robbed of my Shoes and all my Money , and one of them , says he , had a Striped-Waistcoat on . I was in a Fright for Fear we should be robbed , so we pushed on as hard as we could , and just as we came to Knights-Bridge , in a Bottom , there stood the Prisoner , and two Men on each Side of him . I thought we were beset , and made a little Stand , but one of the Men called me by my Name , and asked me if I had heard of this Robbery ? I told them , I knew the Person very well ; and I asked them if they knew that young Fellow in the Striped-Waistcoat ? No , they said ; nobody knew him . I asked him who he belonged to , and where he lived ? He told me he lived in Cloth-fair , and was going to Kensington-Gore , to see his Sweetheart , one Mrs. Green 's Daughter : I told him it was improper to go a courting without a Coat ; he reply 'd , he was a Lamp-lighter , and seldom wore a Coat . I said I am afraid you are the Man that committed this Robbery , for you answer King 's Description , and somebody holding up a Candle and Lanthorn to his Face , he coloured prodigiously . God forbid , says I , that I should accuse an innocent Man , but you are like the Person that King described . O Lord ! ( says he ) I will go along with you , I wo n't offer to go away . I thought proper he should be taken into Custody , and he was delivered to the Constable and Beadle . Prisoner . Was it a very light Night ? Colcot . It was Moonlight , but not very bright : Not light enough to distinguish a Man 's Face . Edward Underwood , Beadle . On the 12th of last Month I was going my Rounds , three Quarters after Ten o'Clock , and at the Corner of Nag's-Head Court , I saw the Prisoner , and heard him ask a Man if he had seen any Body run that Way , for a Person ( says he ) has been robbed a little higher ? I told him no one had run the Way I came , and I enquired which Way the Man was gone who had been robbed ? The Prisoner said he was gone towards Kensington , and he very readily went with us a pretty Wav after the Prosecutor , on the Causeway , by Hyde-Park Wall ; then we returned , and the Prisoner with us , searched several Courts . As we were searching , I asked the Prisoner his Name ; he told me twas Abraham Nash ; that he was a Lamp-lighter ; that he lived in Cloth Fair ; that he courted a Girl at Kensington-Gore , and was then going thither . He told us he was about an hundred Yards from King when he was robbed , and that upon his [ King 's ] crying out , he turned back and pursued the Thieves , with King and two other Men , as far as Bear Court , and then King not caring to go any farther , he gave over the Pursuit likewise . Presently after , I was saying - it was a surprizing Thing the Thieves should get off , and we all so near , and upon that the Prisoner began to move away , and was got about 10 Yards from us , when Mr. Colcot came and asked us , if any of us knew the Prisoner ? Telling us at the same Time , that he answered the Description that King had given of one of the Men , therefore he spoke to the Prisoner , and after he had asked him several Questions , I took him into Custody , and we went with him to King , at Kensington , and he said directly , - this is one of the Men that robbed me , - this was the Man that held his Pistol to my Breast , and desired me to take Charge of him . These Shoes we found next Morning . King . They are the same I was robbed of . George Whiting . I was going my Rounds about Two o'Clock , and found a Coat upon the Threshold of a Door , near the Queen 's Head , at Knights-Bridge , and this Pistol under the Coat . It has a Crack on each Side the Trigger , and was loaded very high . Mr. Deveil drew the Charge this Morning , and this is the Ball that was in it . Mr. Deveil . The Pistol has been in my Custody ever since the Prisoner was brought before me . I drew it this Morning , for it was loaded so high , that I was afraid some Accident might happen . Samuel Watts . Three Weeks ago , ( on a Thursday ) the Prisoner and I made an Agreement to go out a robbing . Accordingly we set out from Crown Court , in Chick Lane , to the Wall between , Knights-Bridge and Kensington . We stood Two Hours ( I am certain ) by the Half-Way House , and let several People pass , who we thought were not worth our Trouble to rob ; and then I asked him if we should go Home ? No , he said ; he wanted Money for the Holidays , and would have it from somebody ; so we resolved to attack the first Man we met , which happened to be this Mr. King . I was a little way a-head of [ before ] the Prisoner , when he demanded his Money and clapped his Pistol to his Breast , but upon his stopping the Man , I turned back , and while he stood with his Pistol in that Posture , I kneeled down and took off the Prosecutor 's Shoes , because the Prisoner said he wanted a Pair , so I took them off , - as he bid me . The Prisoner asked me if the Buckles were Silver ? The Prosecutor said , - no , they cost him but a Groat , so I gave him them again . When we had got every thing , we went off , and met two Men , and when we had passed them we ran faster . I bid the Prisoner keep along with me ; he would not ; but ran away from the Causeway down the Middle of the Road , and fell all along . But I observing a Woman to look out of the Window , kept strait along , 'till I came to a little Turning by the White-Bear , and I ran down that Turning , and got over a Wall into Hyde-Park , and so into Grosvenor Square . Then I went Home , and saw no more of the Prisoner 'till I was taken . The Prisoner had two Striped-Waistcoats on , a white Apron , a Cotton-Cap , a white pair of Breeches , and an old Coat , with a plush Cape . Thomas Cutter . The Coat which the Watchman found , the Prisoner owned to be his , and desired to have it because he had nothing on but a Waistcoat . Mr. Deveil let him have it . Mr. Deveil . The Prisoner deny 'd the Coat to be his when the Watchman brought it ; but finding the Evidence strong , he owned it ; And said he lent it the Evidence that Night to rob in . The Evidence and the Prisoner were both before me at that Time . Defence . Catherine Sommerly . Once or twice I have seen the Evidence in a ragged Coat , with a Sort of a Plush-Cape to it . Once he came to our House in it , and said he was going to a Master , to treat with him about lighting his Lamps . Another Time he came in it , and staid half a Day . I live in Short's-Gardens , Drury-Lane . Mr. Deveil . When the Prisoner was brought before me , he was desirous of being made an Evidence , and if the Prosecutor had not sworn positively to him , I should have consented . He confessed this Robbery , and eleven or twelve more , and accus 'd the Evidence of being an Accomplice ; upon which I granted a Warrant to take him , [ the Evidence ] but the Prosecutor could swear only to the Prisoner . I took his Confession in Writing , and only told him that Confession should not be produced against him . I said nothing to him about his Confession , till after King had sworn to him . Guilty , Death . 240.

Jane Smith and Mary Corker were indicted for privately stealing a Gold Watch and Gold Seat , value , 3 l. from the Person of Edward Spragg , April 2 . And Thomas Smith for receiving the same , knowing them to be stole . Edward Spragg . About two o'Clock in the Morning the 2 d of last Month , I was coming from the King 's Arms Tavern in the Strand , and at Charing Cross , at the Entrance of some Court thereabouts , I met with the two Women at the Bar . It was dark , so I have no Knowledge of their Faces , and I was pretty much in Liquor , so I ca n't answer for it , how far I was prevailed upon to listen to them . I was going to my Lodging in Westminster , and either in the Street , or in the Court , one of them took an Opportunity to pick my Pocket . I suspected them , on their endeavouring to run away , so I seized Jane Smith , and charged her with picking my Pocket : She deny 'd it , but I held her fast 'till I got to Whitehall , and then I demanded the Assistance of some Soldiers , and they carried her to the Round-House in St. Margaret 's Church Yard , where she was searched , but to no Purpose , and she deny 'd the Fact . Presently after , the Beadle , or Constable went out , and took Mary Corker , and I believe she was search 'd , and nothing being found upon her , she deny 'd it likewise . Next Morning this Man , ( George Swindell ) came to me and told me he believed he could tell me where my Watch was ; and that I must get a Warrant for the Man that had it was a Soldier upon Duty on the Parade . I got a Warrant for him , ( Thomas Smith ) and the Officer delivered him up to us . At first he deny 'd knowing any Thing of it ; but when he was before the Justice , and was ordered to be searched , he said he would not give us that Trouble , he had the Watch about him , and produced it directly . When the two Women were before the Justice , Jane Smith owned she picked my Pocket of it : She said she took it out of my Pocket . Jane Smith . I will take my Tryal when my Husband is cleared ; for he was abed and asleep when the Thing was done . Did not you pick us both up , and ask us where we were going ? And did we not tell you , we were going where we could pick up a Sweetheart ? Upon which you told us you would give us a Glass of Wine in a convenient Place , and make us a Present . Spragg . I own I met them in the Strand , but 't is to no Purpose to ask me any Questions , for , as I hope for Mercy , I ca n't tell what I said to them . George Swindell . I am a Barber , and shaved and powdered Thomas Smith . He came into my Shop that Morning about Seven o'Clock , and pulled this Watch out of his Pocket , and I looked at it . Spragg . This is my Watch . Swindell . This is the Watch the Prisoner ( Thomas Smith ) shewed me . I saw him afterwards under Arms on the Parade , and having learned at the Round-house that a Gentl man had lost such a one the Night before , I went to Mr. Hilsley , the Constable , and he directed me to Mr. Spragg . John Hilsley . On Monday Morning , April 2 , between Two and Three o'Clock , this Gentleman brought Jane Smith to the Watch-house in St. Margarets Church-Yard , and charged her with picking his Pocket of a Gold Watch in a Court somewhere about Chairing-Cross . I understood by Jane Smith , 't was done in Northumberland Court . She insisted upon it , that she had it not , and that several other Women were with him , and if it was lost , somebody else had it . The Gentleman was positive that only she and another Woman were with him ; upon which I purged her , to know who that other Woman was , and at last she said if it was any body , 't was Mary Corker , and described her to us . We then secured her , and went out to see after Corker ; and hearing by a Watchman , that She and Thomas Smith , the Soldier , were just gone down an Alley , we went after them , and seeing a Man and a Woman before us , I stepped after the Woman , and caught hold of her , [ Corker ] but the Soldier ran away as hard as he could . We carry 'd her to the Watch-house and searched her , but did not find the Watch . However we locked Her and Jane Smith up in the Round-house 'till Morning ; and about Nine o'Clock Swindell ( the Barber ) came and inform 'd me he had seen such a Watch in Thomas Smith's-Possession , so we got a Warrant and took him off the Parade ; and at Justice Manley 's he pulled out the Watch , and said he would not give us the Trouble to search him . After this we sent to fetch the two Women , and at an Alehouse ( where we waited 'till the Justice could hear us ) Jane Smith confessed she took it out of the Gentleman 's Pocket , - yes , damn her Soul she did , and she did not value it , - she had kept a House before now , at Antigua , she said ; and ( snapping her Fingers ) she did not value being sent there , nor going abroad , provided she was not sent to Virginia or Maryland . She owned that while the Gentleman was fond of her , she took his Watch out of his Pocket , and convey 'd it to Corker . Ann Swindell . The next Morning after the Fact was committed , I going to Tothil-street ; and seeing a Mob about the Round-house , I made up like one of the Foolish Women , to see what was the Matter : I saw Jenny Smith at the Window , and Molly Corker was asleep ; I bid Jenny wake Molly , and then I asked them , what they were there for ? Jenny Smith took a Gold Watch from under her Petticoats , and a black String and a Seal and Key out of her Stocking , which she shew 'd me , and said , - Is not this a noble Watch ? And Thomas Smith , her Husband , standing at the Window , she gave it to him , and said , - My dear Tom Smith be true to me ; he took the Watch from her , and said , - D-mn my Soul if I am not , then he put it into his Pocket . Jane Smith . This Woman came to the Round-house , to ask Molley Corker for her Cloak ; and she told us she was going for two Gallons of Liquor , and would send us a Dram ; and she said , that as we had been searched , we might keep the Watch , and might make the most of it ; so she took it away with her in some foul Linnen , and carry 'd it to my Husband . The Gentleman that pick 'd us up told us he had no smaller Money than a Moidore , and must trust to his Honour ; I found the Watch in my Cloaths , and as he was so dishonourable as to cheat us , I thought I would not give it him again . Thomas Smith . I met Mrs. Swindell that Morning in Green's-Alley , and she desired me to carry a dirty Cap and an Apron , and the Watch , to her House : She told me a Man had left it with her for a Pledges so I took it and went to the Barber 's , and from thence to the Parade , where I was taken . Ann Swindell . On my Oath , Smith gave it her Husband through the Window . Jane Smith , Guilty , Death . Thomas Smith , Guilty . Corker , Acquitted . [ Thomas Smith : Transportation .

I made all the Enquiry I could after her , but could hear nothing of her , till the 3d or 4th of April : The Prisoner was then taken upon Mr. Hall 's Horse , and being sent to the Round-house , I went to him , and asked him , If he knew any Thing of my Lord Burlington 's Mare ? He said , if I would let him come out , and go with him to a Publick House , he would tell me what was become of her , and some other Horses : Upon this we took him to an Alehouse , and there he told me the Mare was sold to a one-eyed Farmer at Rochester . I went thither , and found her with one Thomas Wood , who told me he bought her at Maidstone Fair , and that she was there enter 'd in the Toll-book . I went to Maidstone to be satisfied ; she was enter 'd , and the Seller 's Name in the Toll-book was not Sedgewick , but Seddock The Prisoner confess 'd he took her out of the Meadows , with the Assistance of one Thomas Jones . Prisoner . 'T is the first Fact I ever did in my Life : I always behaved handsomely , and work 'd under Mr. Goring for my Lord Burlington . Goring . I am Bailiff under his Lordship , and have the Care of his Farms . In September last I discharged him for some Fault in his Work , not for any Dishonesty . John Hooper . I lost my Horse the 20th of March , and advertised him , but could not hear any thing of him : But on the 4th of April , as I was going from my House towards Turnham Green , I saw the Chesnut Gelding going by me with a Clog on ; the Prisoner met me at the same time , and both he and the Gelding went out of the Way I was walking ; but I cast my Eye after him , and saw him pull a Bridle from under his great Coat , or from under his Arm , and put it upon the Horse : Then I went up to him , and he call 'd me by my Name ; I asked him his Name , and where he lived ? He told me his Name was Sedgewick , and that he lived hard by one William Gardiner upon the Green . I told him , I had lost a Gelding some time ago , and if he could give me any Account of it , I would satisfy him for his Pains . I likewise asked him if he knew of a low-pric 'd Horse fit for my Business , that was to be disposed of : Why , ( says he ) here 's a Horse that will do your Business very well ; and that was Mr. Hall 's Horse , that I had just seen him put the Bridle upon . When the Prisoner was put into the Round-house at Chiswick , he told us he would make an open Declaration if we would take him to a Publick House ; we carry 'd him to an Alehouse , and there he told me he had disposed of my Horse at a Place call 'd Plumb-street , about a Mile beyond Woolwich , to a Man whose Name he did not know , but his Wife ( he told me ) lived at the Bell in Kent-street . I went into Kent-street , and by enquiring in the Neighbourhood I learn 'd that the Woman 's Name was Battersea , and that her Husband kept an Ale-house in Plumb-street . My Horse was not a Brown-bay ; it was a Dark-brown , almost a Black ; and I found him in Plumb-Street , in Battersea 's Close , upon which I had a Warrant for him , and the Justice order 'd me my Horse again , and I brought him home ; but he was again stole away last Saturday was se'nnight . Samuel Ivory . I have had Satisfaction for my Horse ; I never had him again : But I lost him on or about the 16th of January out of our Grounds . When the Prisoner was taken , he was had to the Constable 's House , and confess 'd that he and his Comerades took the Horse out of our Fields at Chiswick . Ours was a grey Gelding , and was in a Field call 'd Manor-house-Field : The Prisoner told me , that as there were more Horses in that Field , his Companions would have taken more , but he would not suffer them . He own 'd he had sold our Horse to a Man that keeps a Linnen-draper 's Shop at Rochester ; I went down to him , and he told me , he believed he had bought the Horse of the Prisoner , and rather than have any Trouble , he was willing to make me Satisfaction for it . Richard Hall . Mr. Hooper telling me , he saw the Prisoner go over the Common with my Horse , and that he had seen him put a Bridle on him , I pursu 'd him and took him at Hammersmith Turnpike , upon my Horse which he had taken off Turnham Green . Mine was a Chesnut Gelding : And when the Prisoner was taken , he was brought back , and confess 'd his stealing the Horses of all the People who have been examin 'd . George Edwards . When the Prisoner was taken , as I had lost a Horse , I went to him to enquire after mine : He told me , my Horse was a Brown-bay , and was sold to one Hill , at a Place called Offspring , near Feversham . I went there , and found him , according to the Prisoner 's Direction . Prisoner . I have nothing to say : I am as innocent as the Child unborn ; I was led into this Thing very innocently . Mr. Goring . The Prisoner is a very weak , simple Fellow ; and the Prosecutors would be glad to have his Life spar 'd , and that he might be transported . The Prisoner was found guilty on all the Indictments , but Mr. Hooper 's . [ Death . See summary . ] 252.

Michael Crosby . As I was coming last Sunday Night from Black Mary 's Hole , with this young Woman in Company , towards London , the Prisoner overtook us in the first Field we pass 'd over , and turning upon me he gave me a Jolt . I asked him , What he wanted ? And he ask 'd me , What I wanted ? I told him , I wanted nothing but Civility ; upon that he held up this Iron Bar to me , and said , - d - mn you , you Dog , deliver your Money this Moment , or else I will kill you : The young Woman that was with me ran away from me , and I put my Hand in my Pocket to give him my Money ; but I was the longer in delivering it , because I was thrusting my Watch into my Breeches , when I had done that , I deliver 'd him all my Money , which was 9 s. and 4 d. then he snatch 'd off my Hat and Wig ; but the Wig falling , and he stooping to take it up , I fell upon him , and beat him , and got the better of him . He begg 'd for Mercy ; and I told him , he should have it when we came to any Ale-house nigh Town . While I had him upon the Ground , I held him down with one Hand , and with the other I unty 'd his Garter , and bound him . He entreated me to go back with him to Black Mary 's Hole , and promised to give me not only my own Money again , but all that he had about him : I knew the Houses about Black Mary 's Hole were very bad ones , and as it was about Nine o'Clock at Night , I thought if I went back with him there , I might be stripp 'd of all ; so I resolv 'd to bring him to Town , and had got him about forty Yards from the Place where I bound him , when some People came to my Assistance . Prisoner . Did I demand your Money ? Crosby . Yes . In the Quarrel he got hold of both my Thumbs at once ; I could not disengage myself , so I bit his Nose ; that would not untangle me ; I was forc 'd to tear the Flesh off my Thumb in getting it from him . Margaret Pinkney . Michael Crosby and I were coming from Islington to Town , and I perceived a Man in a Flannel Waistcoat coming towards us . He jostled against Crosby , and Crosby asked him , what he wanted . I do n't know the Man , for it was dark , and I could not see his Face , but I heard him ask Crosby what he wanted ; Crosby answer 'd , - nothing but Civility then I took to my Heels , and ran away toward the Houses : I desired the People at a Publick House to go into the Fields , telling them a young Man in blue grey was in Danger from a Man in a striped Flannel Waistcoat , and they went out to his Assistance . Samuel Jones . I was sitting at the Sign of the Apple-tree , at the Corner of Warner street , and this young Woman came in , and said , - For God 's Sake come out ! - a young Man is set upon by a Man in a striped Flannel Waistcoat , and I am afraid he will be murder 'd . I said , If any Body will go with me , I will go to his Assistance ; and I asked her her Friend 's Name ; she told me 't was Michael : So I went out , and stood at a Stile , and call 'd out , - Michael , as loud as I could , but no body answer 'd . The young Woman [ Pinkney ] was very much 'frighted , and I was persuaded not to go any farther ; but a Link-boy coming by , I snatch 'd the Link out of his Hands , and bid him come along with me ; I went about 100 Yards into the second Field , and there I met Michael Crosby with the Prisoner : he held the Prisoner by the Nape of the Neck , and had hardly Strength to bring him along , he puff 'd , and could only say , - I have got him . The Place where I met Crosby and the Prisoner , is a private Way , which leads from the Corner of Warner-street to Black Mary 's Hole ; not many People pass that Way . 'T is a common Foot-path in a Field that joins to the Highway . Crosby . The high Road runs by the Side of the Field , and there 's a cross Path through the Field to Black Mary 's Hole . George Cannon . Last Sunday Night , about Nine o'Clock , these Men , Crosby and Jones , brought the Prisoner out of the Fields to the Corner of Warner-street , ( where I was drinking a Pint of Beer ) . Crosby said , - For God 's Sake assist me , - this Man has robb 'd me , and us 'd me ill . Upon that I caught hold of his Collar , and he had this Knife in his Hand , and was going to stab Crosby directly ; but I knock 'd the Knife out of his Hand , and he was carry 'd before a Justice , and committed to New Prison . Prisoner . I am a poor Lad , and work 'd hard for my Bread . I took a Walk last Sunday Afternoon into the Fields , and quarelling with the Prosecutor , he got the better of me , and charg 'd me with robbing him ; I bid him use me civilly , and let him take off one of my Garters , and bind me . Did not I go with you civilly ? Crosby . Yes , when I had bound you ; because I had got this Iron Bar from him , and threaten 'd to beat him with it , if he did not . Prisoner . Did you not search me before the Justice ? Crosby . He said he had Money of his own about him , when he was carry 'd before the Justice ; but on searching him , we could find none at all . Prisoner . Were not my Hands ty 'd , and had not Crosby hold of them , and another Hold of my Shoulder ? My Hands were ty 'd close to me ; and they , taking a Knife off the Pavement , - swore I drop 'd it . Jones . His Wrists were ty 'd , but not close together : He had the Length of my Finger between his two Hands .

On the 9th of April , at Night , I carried the Prisoner to one Bird 's House , in the Coal-Yard , in Holborn ; ( I suppose he will be here presently ) We called for some Liquor , and after that we asked for a Room , and went up together , & c. This Bird keeps a bad House I believe . - About Ten or Eleven o'Clock , I called for some Liquor ; and Ann Bryan ( the next Witness ) brought up a hot Pint . I felt for Money to pay for it , and missed my Watch , and my Money . There was nobody in the Room but the Prisoner and this Brian , who brought up the Liquor ; and I believe the Prisoner is not Guilty , for I take it , - the Evidence [ Brian ] is the Person who convey 'd away the Watch . Ann Brian . I went into the Room with the hot Pint , and saw the Prisoner and the Prosecutor - together . He bid her take Money out of his Pocket to pay me ; she did so , and I saw her pull out his Watch , and laid it upon the Cloaths . I bid him give it me , that I might give it Mr. Bird to take of ; but the Prisoner said she could take care of it herself . Sometime afterwards he called for a Candle , and said he had lost his Watch and his Money ; then he made her move out at her Place , and found 3 s. 6 d. 1/2 under her , which he gave to me , and told me , it was all the Money he had left . After I had been committed to New Prison , and she to Newgate , Mr. Bird said , he found the Watch under some Bricks in the Chimney . Robert Bird . When Brian was sent to New Prison , she told the Constable , she believed the Watch was in the Room where Donalson and the Prisoner had been together ; and she desired him to come to me , and beg that I would search the Room . I did , and found the Watch under two Bricks in the Chimney , at the End of the Grate . Mr. Wood , Constable . On the 9th of April , the Prosecutor brought Brian and the Prisoner before me , and charged them with stealing a Watch . The next Day I took them before Mr. Deveil , and Brian swore the Prisoner gave her the Watch , but she had given it to her again . When Brian was in the Coach going to New Prison , she told me , - if she could be admitted to the House , she believed the Watch would be found . I left that Notice at Bird 's House , and in about two Hours Time Bird came to my House , and told me he had found the Watch in the Chimney . The Court reprimanded Donalson for his Conduct , and the Jury Acquitted the Prisoner . 261.

Samuel Masters , of St. Ann 's , Westminster , was indicted for stealing 20 lb . of Lead , value 8 d. fixed to the Freehold Mesluage , or Tenement of the Rt . Hon . Thomas , Lord Onslow , April 12 . James Gibbins . I have a Lease of two of my Lord Onslow 's Houses in Tyburn Road ; we were repairing them ; and the Lead was upon them . I can only say , I was called up early in the Morning , and saw it rolled up , ready to be taken away . Peter Ponsir . I am a Watchman in Tyburn-Road . I was going my Rounds the 10th Day of April at Twelve at Night , and heard a Noise in the empty House , and I called my Brother Watchman to stand at the Door , while I went into the House . I found the Prisoner in the Garret , and the Lead and some Casements were by him . As soon as he saw me , he collered me , and asked me what Business I had there . Then he pushed by me , and ran down Stairs into the Cellar , and from thence up another Pair of Stairs and hid himself in a Closet , where we found him , and he told us be intended to do all the Mischief he could that Night . The Lead and four Casements were rolled up , ready to be carry 'd away . William Collins . I was called to assist my Brother Watchman , and stood at the Cellar Door . The Prisoner came down Stairs , and slipped thro ' the Joists into the Cellar ; but upon seeing my Lanthorn he run up Stairs and hid himself in a Closer , where we found him . When we seized him , he told us , he had been that Night with the Overseers of the Parish , and they would not allow him any Thing for his Subsistance , so his Design was to do all the Mischief he could that Night . Prisoner . I lay two Nights before in the House ; he knows I did , and had a Fire there ; for I had no Money to pay for a Lodging , and they knew that I was in the House . There was a Noise in the House ; ( I heard it : ) so they came in , and took me away for the Sake of Twenty Shillings ; which the Parish allows , for every Person they can convict . When they attempted to take me away , I scuffled with them , as well as I could , and in the Scuffle I tumbled down Stairs . Ponsir . I did give him Leave to lye in the next House , and another Man was with him , but not in the House where he was taken . Jury . This Man has been a Parishioner in that very Parish for some Years , and has served Offices in the Parish . He kept a Publick House in this very House a great While , but he is now lame and reduced so low , that one of our Jury-Men at a Club-Feast made a Collection for him , to keep him from Starving . The Parish ought to do something for him . The Court censured the Parish 's ill Usage of the Prisoner . Acquitted . 265.

Thomas Hitchins , Constable . I searched the Prisoner 's Lodgings in Vine street , near Round Court in the Strand , in the Presence of Mr. Doughty , and one or two more . These are the Goods we seized , some were produced before Justice Fraser , the rest were in a Cart near the Justice 's Door . I sealed the Bags up into which they were put ; the Goods in them are what we found in the Prisoner 's Lodging , and they have been in my Possession ever since , without any Alteration at all . Mr. Doughty . These are my Goods ; they were in my Shop , and were stole from thence . This is a Piece of my Buckram , and I know it by my Stamp at each Corner ; and I was present when this and the rest of the Goods were taken at the Prisoner 's Lodgings . Here is another Piece of Buckram ; and this is my Silesia Holland , I bought of this Gentleman : He and his Clerk are here to vouch they are my Goods . About nine Weeks ago I had the Misfortune to have an Iron Bar fall on my Leg , by which Accident I was confin 'd for seven Weeks to my Chamber . The Prisoner went away from me two or three Days before the Accident happen 'd ; so I had not Time to examine my Shop till I was recover 'd ; and then several of my Customers told me , they could buy Goods cheaper of the Prisoner than they could of me : I thought that was strange , and suspecting they might be my Goods , I cast up my Shop , and found by my Bills of Parcels , that I had lost 150 l. Worth of Goods . Counc . What Quantity of Goods did you find at his Lodgings ? Doughty . Here are several Parcels which I can not swear to . I can be positive to these two Pieces of Buckram , and three Pieces of Silesia Holland , and these three Pieces of White ; here 's my Stamp on them . There are more Buckrams , but we have not produced them all . Counc . How many Pieces can you be positive to ? Doughty . About ten Pieces , - all mark 'd with my Mark . Here 's seven Pieces of White , which I am positive to ; they are stamp 'd at each Corner , and here 's the Man who made this Stamp for me . Counc . How long had the Prisoner been gone from you when you miss 'd the Goods ? Doughty . About a Month , or better . Prisoner 's Q . Was not you arrested for Wages due to me , before I was charged with this Robbery ? Doughty . Yes ; and I had a Suspicion of him then , but I had not Time to examine my Books : I remember I said to the Officer , - There 's something extraordinary in this Man , for he us 'd to go like a Nobleman . I paid him 10 l. a Year , Wages , and sent to him in Order to pay him before I was arrested . He was my Servant , and I trusted him to sell in the Shop ; but these Goods which we found in his Lodgings , could not be sold in my Shop , by my Directions , I am sure they were not : I miss 'd to the Number of 50 Pieces of Goods . Counc . How long before you miss 'd these Goods , had you seen them in your Shop ? Doughty . I ca n't tell certainly ; because I have a great Quantity of them . Prisoner 's Q . Might not those Goods be sold out of the Shop with the Mark on them ? Doughty . As he was trusted to sell Goods in the Shop , he must sell them with the Mark on them . It was his Business to sell in the Shop , and to keep my Books . Prisoner 's Q . Did not you settle Accounts with me , and cast up the Books , before you parted with me . Doughty . No . John Doughty , junior . I went with my Father and the Constable to the Prisoner 's Lodging , where these Goods were found . I have been conversant with my Father 's Shop and Business ever since last March was Twelvemonth , and know these Goods are my Father 's : I believe they might have been in the Shop about three or four Months before they were miss 'd . I attended in the Shop while my Father 's illness lasted , ( which was near seven Weeks ) for the Prisoner had been gone about two Days before ; and no body did Business in the Shop , while my Father was ill , but myself . Counc . Did you miss any Quantity of Buckrams out of the Shop , before your Father came down into the Shop ? Doughty junior . No . But when he came down , he was sensible ( upon searching the Shop ) that a great many Pieces were wanting . Prisoner 's Q . Can you say these Goods were not sold out of the Shop ? Doughty junior . Yes . If they were sold , they were never enter 'd in the Books , nor did we ever receive a Farthing for them . Counc . What is the Value of the Goods that lye before you ? Doughty junior . About 10 l. and the Value of the Buckrams that we can swear to is about 5 l. James Collins . I stiffen 'd these Pieces of Buckram for Mr. Doughty ; I believe these have been stiffen 'd about a Quarter of a Year : I know they are his Goods , and were done at my House ; for we always stamp every Persons Goods with their own Mark . We have a Penny a Yard for Stiffening them . I have look 'd over about a Dozen Pieces , and ca n't say whether this Piece may not have been stiffen 'd a Twelvemonth ago . David Harper I know the Prisoner , and went to his Lodging the 28th of last Month , to look on some Buckrams that he had to dispose of ; and I bought these two Pieces , at 6 d. a Yard , of the Prisoner at the Bar , which is cheaper than the Market Price by 2 d. a Yard . I am a Taylor , and the usual Price is 8 d. I bought these two Pieces by Mr. Doughty 's Direction , that he might see whether they were his Goods . I believe this Buckram was never bought unstiffen 'd under 6 d. a Yard . DEFENCE . Prisoner . I sold these Buckrams in Mr. Doughty 's Shop , to a Gentleman that was going Abroad , with many other Goods ; the Money for them was received and book 'd , and I can prove when the Goods were delivered : But the Person not going the Voyage that he expected , he told me the Goods would be of no Use to him , so I bought them again of him . Mr. Fraser . When the Prisoner was brought before me , I asked him how he came by so large a Quantity of Goods ? He told me they had been Mr. Doughty 's Goods , but he bought them of a Surgeon , who had paid Mr. Doughty for them , and was now gone Abroad . Prisoner . The Gentleman who bought them of Mr. Doughty did not go the Voyage he expected , so I took the Goods off his Hands , and paid him 18 Guineas for them . This was in the Month of November , and they were lodg 'd at a Friend 's House , till I left my Master , then I took them to my Lodging . As to the Galloons , I buy my Goods of the Makers and Hawkers , and they must sell to more People than Mr. Doughty . The Day after I left him , I went to him for my Wages , and he used me very civilly , but did not pay me then ; and three or four Days after that he heard I was ill , he sent and offer 'd me my Money ; however , I was not paid , and I brought a Writ against him for it . Mr. Doughty , senior . The Prisoner came to me the latter End of December , and went away in February last . David Fryer . In November last the Prisoner brought some Buckrams to my House , while he was in his Master 's Service , and he took them away about eight or ten Days after he had left him : They came either by a Porter , or a Cart , and were after wards carry 'd to his Lodging ; he told me he had them of one Mr. Brown . I ca n't tell whether these are the same Pieces that were at our House , but they were the same Sort of Goods ; and the Prisoner himself desired me to let him leave them at my House . Robert Skinner . I have dealt with the Prisoner lately : I sold him 11 Pieces of white Linnen on the 17th or 18th of last Month , and he paid me for them ; but these Goods that are now produced are none of them which I sold him . He bought no other Goods of me but what are mentioned in this Bill of Parcels . I have known him five Years ; and never knew of his being given to pilfering , nor ever knew him suspected before . Mr. Hyde . I know the Prisoner : I have sold him brown Irish Linnen , but there are none of them among the Goods now produced . Mr. Clavey . I have sold the Prisoner two small Parcels of Irish Buckrams , at 10 1/2 d. ( I think ) a Yard , for the Use of Stay-makers : These that are produced are of another Sort ; these are for Taylors , they are Scotch Buckrams , and are not what I sold him . Col. Sinclair . About two Years ago the Prisoner came out of the Country , and brought me a Letter of Recommendation from my Sister , the Lady Beard , wherein she desired me to get him into some Shop-keeper 's Service , and told me therein , that he had an honest Character , and could keep Books , and that she should take it as a Favour if I could get him recommended as a Book-keeper ; and I accordingly spoke to some People , in order to get him into Business : He has an Uncle at Edinburgh , who is a Shop-keeper , and a Man of a fair Character . I never heard the Prisoner was addicted to Pilfering . Mr. Lindsay . The Prisoner I know serv 'd his Apprenticeship with one Mr. Stewart , at Edinburgh , and had a good Character while he was there . His Uncle is a considerable Dealer at Edinburgh , but I ca n't say I know any Thing of the Prisoner 's Character since he came here . Mr. Brown . I have known the Prisoner ever since he came to Mr. Doughty . I took him to be an honest Man , and have heard Mr. Doughty say he believ 'd him to be so ; and that the Prisoner gave such Satisfaction to his Customers , that they chose to be serv 'd by him , and by none but him . I never heard any Thing laid to his Charge , or that he was addicted to Pilfering before . James Russel . The Prisoner had lodged in my House when he was taken up , eight Weeks and two Days ; he behaved soberly , liv 'd moderately , and I never heard him swear in my Life . He used to bring in Goods in the Day-time , and People used to come to him to buy them . - Warren . I have known him a Year last November ; he bore a universal good Character . I am a Hair-cutter ; and he used to come to my Shop to have his Hair done up : I was once drinking with him and Mr. Doughty 's Son , and I would have had another Tankard , but he would go home , because it was about Ten o'Clock . Mr. Fryer . I have known him about eight Years , and never knew any Thing amiss of him in my Life . Guilty , Death .The Jury recommended the Prisoner to his Majesty 's Clemency . 269.

I was with the two Prisoners , and another Man , ( a Stranger ) when they took Mr. Sympson 's Mare , and help 'd to take her ; we took her from Old Pond Course on Endfield Chace . Sympson . I put her there , and lost her from thence . Lewis . It was on the 23d of May , in the Year 1736 ; I do n't know what they did with her , for after I had caught her for them , I went to sold my Sheep . They were to give me 10 s. for my Pains , but when they had got the Mare , they never gave me any Thing . The Reason I did not discover this sooner was , because I was loth to blow myself to the World ; but when they came to swear for Bonner the Highwayman , I foreswore their Company , and deserted them ever since . Another Reason I did not discover them was , because Simon Lewis is my Brother-in-Law . I never have been easy in my Conscience since it was done , and I have been sick and like to die , so I resolved to ease my Mind , and let the World know how they live . A . Wells . Why did not you charge me before ? This Man indicted me at Doctor 's Commons about eight Years ago . I never had to do with him in my Life , - I never knew him . D. Wells . I know nothing of the Matter . Abraham Wells . I have known John Chapman a pretty while , 5 or 6 or 7 Years . I do n't live near him ; but I arrested his Brother-in-Law , and he said he would get Wells into Newgate . As to having heard any Ill of them , - I ca n't say , - I ca n't say nothing to that . Abraham Wells . I am call 'd , but I never saw either of them in my Life . Edward Gore . I have known Abraham about three or four or five Years ; as to his Character , - really , I ca n't say as to his Character , - only I never heard no Ill of him , - nor have I ever heard any Good of him . I live at Waltham Abbey . Benjamin Garland . I have known Abraham Wells eight or nine Years : He has the Character of a very great Rogue . Prisoner . That 's a Brother-in-Law of mine : He took all my Goods when I was confin 'd in Goal . Parnel . But the Prisoner had my Money for them . As to Daniel Wells , I never saw him till the Night he was taken , on Lewis 's impeaching him : He has but an indifferent Character . Benjamin Parnel . I have known Abraham seven or eight Years : His general Character is but a very indifferent one . I do n't care to say any Thing farther . A . Wells . Why I have dwelt with you , - and paid you honestly . Woodham . Yes , so you have Christopher Woodham . I have known Abraham five Years : He has but a very indifferent Character . He threaten 'd to ruin me . - I know nothing of Daniel . John Keys . I have known Abraham eight or nine Years : He is a Man that bears a bad Character . I know nothing of Daniel . Samuel Wibert . I have known him twelve Years : He has but a very slender Character . I could say more , if your Lordship would hear it . - He 's a very bad Neighbour , in respect to Stealing ; he has a bad Character that Way , and gets his Bread by it . A . Wells . Did not I pay you , when I dealt with you ? Long . Yes ; and you have eat me out again very handsomely . Henry Long . I have known Abraham eight or nine Years ; I never heard a Man have a worse Character in my Life , except a Murtherer : The first Time I saw Daniel was when he was taken at Epping ; he has a bad Character there . Richard Fletcher . I have known Abraham ten Years . His Character is bad : - no one 's worse . I have no great Knowledge of Daniel , - I know nothing of his Character . John Slighter . I have known Abraham Seven or Eight Years . His General Character is base , - none 's worse . I heard that he 's a very dishonest Man , using his Neighbours ill . I have heard much to his Dispraise . William Green . I have known Abraham Twelve Years : I never heard any Character of him , but that of a Thief , since I have known him . I have known Daniel a pretty while . I do n't know much of him - he lives in another Country , but I have heard from several of his Neighbours , that he has a bad Character . A . Wells . When I dealt with you , did not I pay you honestly ? Elson . I never dealt with you at all . James Elson . Who is it that gives me a bad Character ? Elson . All the Butchers that come from Epping , say you are as bad as Abraham , and that there 's no Difference between them . Daniel Wells . I have known Abraham Seven or Eight Years . His general Character is very bad . I know nothing of Daniel . Daniel Wells . They know nothing of me , nor do I know any thing of them . Abraham Wells . My Wife swore the Peace against Lewis 's Wife , and because I would not give him a Guinea to give my Wife , he swore ( with a great Oath ) he would swear something against me . Lewis . There has not been any Quarrels between us lately : My Wife and his Wife may have differed : That 's nothing to me . Both Guilty , Death . 274.

He came on the 10th of April , to meet my Husband , and be informed from him , whether he designed to quit them , or no . The Tankard stood on a turn-up Bed in the Room , and was worth six Pounds , and more . Jane Plummer . While the Prisoner waited in the Room , he gave me a Shilling to fetch a Pot of Beer , and I went to the Ale-house to fetch it . While the Beer was drawing for me , my Mother-in Law ( Jane Plummer ) came to me , and asked if the Man came in there , I told her no ; why says she , he has got the Tankard and is gone away . Upon this we went to look after him , and found him walking with another Man , in the King's-Bench Walks , in the Temple . I ran to this Gentleman , ( the next Witness ) and told him , he had got my Father 's Tankard , so the Gentleman cry 'd , Stop Thief , and we got the Tankard again . Sarah Manning . On the 10th of April , about Seven in the Evening , I met the Prisoner in Serjeant 's Inn , in Fleet street , and saw his Hand under his Apron , with either a Silver Mug , or a Tankard in it , for Part of the Silver was cover 'd with his Apron , and Part was uncovered . This Girl ( Manning ) coming up , and telling me , that Man had got her Father 's Tankard , I pursued him and got up to him , upon which he threw the Tankard with such Violence from him , that it rebounded two Yards , and had I not got out of the Way , I believe he would have broke my Legs with it . Mr. Evans ( the next Witness ) took it up , and I pursued him to the Steps in Red-Lyon Court , in Fleet street , and there he was taken . Francis Dean . On the 10th of April this Girl [ Manning ] came to me under the Piazza 's in the Temple , and took me by the Sleeves , and said , - That Man ( pointing to the Prisoner ) has got my Father 's Tankard under his green Apron ; upon that I cry 'd Stop Thief , and pursu 'd him cross Tanfield Court into the King 's Bench Walks , and through the Maidenhead Alehouse into Serjeants Inn , and there he threw the Tankard out of his Hand , I took it up , and carry 'd it to the Prosecutor , and he own 'd it .

John Holland and William Bull were indicted for Assaulting Adam Stanton in the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him three Shillings and a Penny Half-penny in Money , March 18 . The Witnesses were examined a-part . David Parry . About Nine o'Clock at Night , on the 19th of March , as I was coming over Tower-Hill , I was stripp 'd of my Money , but who took it , I ca n't tell . I can give no Manner of Account of my being attacked , or having a Squabble , but I did not carry home one Farthing of Money . I had been at Lambeth , and carried Money out with me , and the last Publick House I was at , was on London Bridge . And I remember I parted with a Friend at the Monument , and that somebody took my Money from me on Tower Hill , but who they were that did it , I ca n't tell , nor what passed between us ; but I lost 3 s. and some Half-Pence upon Tower-Hill . I 'm sure it was there . David Parry . The two Prisoners and I , made an Agreement to go a-thieving on the 18th of March last - Prisoner . And the former Witness swore to the 19th . Parry . It was the 18th of March , - I am sure 't was on a Sunday Night I was robbed . Dent . They and I went out a Thieving ; we went out first upon the Water , and got into two Sloops , but we could make no Hand of it , and being pursued , we came ashore , and as we were going over Tower-Hill , Bull said , the first Man we met , he would have his Money or his Life . And happening to meet Mr. Parry , we held him , while Bull searched his Pockets . He pulled out a Penknife with a Buckshorn Handle , and threatn 'd to rip out his Guts if he did not deliver his Money . We took three Shillings and one Penny Half-penny from him , and divided one Shilling and a Half penny a piece . I never saw the Prosecutor before that Night , to my Knowledge , but I heard his Name , for while Bull was rifling his Pockets , he said , do n't hurt poor Mr. Parry , for he is a Man that hurts nobody . When the Prisoners were carry 'd before the Justice , and Mr. Parry was sent for , Bull , as soon as he saw him , said to a Gentleman that stood by him , - here comes the Jamming Cull , ( meaning the Man that was to hang him . ) Prisoners . How come you to find out Mr. Parry so soon ? Dent . After we had robbed him , we followed him down Rosemary Lane , and I took Notice where he went in . Achilles Dent . I was at the apprehending the two Prisoners , and Bull told me , if he had thought he should have seen my ugly Face , he would have been many Miles off . When they were before the Justice , Black Sam [ Stanton ] desired me to speak to the Justice , that he might be admitted an Evidence , for says he , this Evidence ( Dent ) can speak to nothing but this Robbery , and I can speak to four or five more , he ( Dent ) has not been long enough with us to tell of any more than this one . Bull . If Col. Williamson was here he would secure Sullivan , for sending Men to France . Thomas Sullivan . I am a Servant to the Keeper of New Prison . The two Prisoners and Dent were brought to us at Twelve o'Clock at Night , and the next Morning were carry 'd before Mr. Justice Farmer ; the two Prisoners were hand-cuff 'd , and the Evidence had an Iron on : When they were before Mr. Farmer , Dent told us where Mr. Parry liv 'd , and a Porter was sent for him , but he return 'd , and could not find the House ; upon which Mr. Farmer order 'd me to go with Dent , and see if we could find it ; so we went out together , and he carry 'd me to it , and told me at that Time , that the Man 's Name was Parry ; I enquired at the House for Mr. Parry , and his Wife told me he belong 'd to the Custom-house , and was not at Home , but he should come between Two and Three o'Clock ; and he accordingly came , and gave an Account of this Robbery . As to the Knife which the Evidence mentions , I search 'd Bull , and took it out of his Pocket the Morning he was hand-cuff 'd : I heard the Evidence mention before the Justice , that while they were rifling the Man , he said , Do n't hurt poor Mr. Parry , & c. When we had been before the Justice , Bull snatch 'd up a Pint Pot , and gave the Evidence such a Knock with it , that I thought he had beat his Brains out . Bull . And I had Reason enough , when he was about to swear my Life away . Miller . This is the tenth or twelfth time that Bull has been tried for his Life . Jury . How came this Evidence to be taken up ? Dent . I was taken up on one Emanual Hubbard 's Information ; and was in Custody , but he could not find a Prosecutor . Bull . When the Thief-Takers caught us , they said , There was 280 l. dead Money for them . I was born in Colchester , and have no Friends , but I am not to be cast for that . Stanton . I have no Friends ; I was born in Antigua . Both Guilty of Felony * only . * N. B. Robbery is a felonious and violent taking away from the Person of another , Goods to any Value , putting him in Fear : Now the Jury were of Opinion , there was not sufficient Evidence of the Violence , ( in which Case the Law would presume putting in Fear ) and that it was no more than a private taking from the Person .

William Hanks . On the 8th of April , a little before Twelve at Night , I was robbed as I was coming through a Court near Knaves-acre , of a Silver Watch , a Pair of Silver Shoe-buckles , a Stock-buckle , and some Money , but I ca n't tell what it was , for I was pretty full of Liquor . I ca n't be positive who robb 'd me , but I know I was assaulted by three or four Persons , and I believe the Prisoner was not one of them that robb 'd me , - I believe he was the Man that came up to assist me ; but the Thief-takers have told me , that if I would swear his Life away , I should have a Share of the Reward . Some of them deserve Hanging more by half than the Prisoner . The Foreman of the Jury . The Prisoner works for two reputable Men , and has a good Character . William Hanks was call 'd , but did not appear . William Attley . I and Alice Taber were going down Swallow-street , and we met the Prosecutor ; we asked him to give us a Dram , and we carry 'd him to a Cellar in Peter-street , where we drank six or seven Penn'orth of Gin : As we were drinking , down comes Joseph Casey ( the Prisoner , ) and ask 'd the Prosecutor , ( Hanks ) if the Buttons on his Coat were Silver ? Hanks said , yes ; then d - mn my Blood , says the Prisoner , I have a good Mind to cut them off , and before I leave him I will have his Scout , ( his Watch ) ; then he asked me , whether I would consent for him to take it ? I said , - No , do n't take it here , it will bring the People of the Cellar into Trouble ; take it when he goes up Stairs ; so we went up with Hanks into a Court , and there a Man in a brown Coat quarrelled with him , and afterward left him : Then the Prisoner came up , and knock 'd Hanks down ; I took his Shoe-buckles , he took his Watch , and Martha Jones took his Stock-buckle , and 3 s. and 2 d. in Money . I happen 'd to speak of this Robbery next Morning , and the Thief-takers got hold of it , and it run like a Hue and Cry through a Town . The Robbery was done on the Sunday , and I gave my Information on Monday . Hanks . I was not knock 'd down at all : I was only hustled up against the Side of a House . Martha Jones . * I know nothing of the Robbery , - but I was drinking at a Publick House , and the Prisoner came in with two Women , and asked me to drink with him ; I did , and then he call 'd me on one Side , and asked me , If I knew any body that would buy a Watch ? I went to a Gentleman 's Servant that was in the House , and ask 'd him the Question ; he bid me let him look at it , so we shew 'd him the Watch in the Yard ; the Prisoner and he agreed , and I saw him sell a Watch for 40 s. The Man 's Name that bought it was Tom Full of Play ; I do n't know whose Watch it was , but Tom Full of Play bought it . * Patrick Cummins was ty 'd with Patrick Cummins ( since executed ) for robbing Henry Fluellin on the Highway , and was Acquitted . See Sessions Book , 1738 . No . 5 . Page 98. Thomas Johnson . I heard the Prisoner say , that if he had Hanks by himself , he would nail him of his Scout , but I do n't know what that means . And when this Elizabeth Willmain was going from the Justice to the New Prison , I heard her say , - Her Conscience prick 'd her , for she had swore wrong against the Prisoner ; but she must either die herself , or hang him . Alice Taber . I was charged with the Prisoner for robbing Hanks , and while he was in my Custody , I heard him say , that Cummins helped him to a Chap for the Watch , and that he ( Cummins ) had bought the Stock-Buckle himself : But I heard nothing how he came by the Watch . Thomas Lovit , Thomas Ward , and others gave the Prisoners a good Character . Hanks . 'T was Mr. Attley would have persuaded me to have sworn against the Prisoner , for the Sake of the Reward .

Thomas Read . On the 7th of October , 1730 , I went from my House at Hockley-in the Hole , about Six in the Evening , to Mr. Wainwright 's at Cow-Cross : I perceived two Men sitting at some Distance from the Door , but it was duskish . About Seven o'Clock a Messenger came to Mr. Wain-wright 's , to tell me I was robbed : I went home , and found several Neighbours in my House , and my Housekeeper , ( Mary-Holford ) unable to speak : her Head was as wet as if a Pail of Water had been thrown on it . Upon going up Stairs into the Garret , which I call my Chamber , I found a Chest broke open , a Deal Box broke all to Pieces , and my Money , which was in it , ( 18 Guineas ) was gone . Holford describ 'd one of the Men that was concerned in the Fact , and her Description made me suspect the Prisoner , whom I had then known about Five Years . On the 21st of the same Month I carried her to a Pay-Table , where he received his Wages , that she might have a Sight of him ; but as soon as he saw me , he went off , and she did not see his Face . I enquired of the Landlord , where the Prisoner lived ? He could not tell . Then I asked him , where he drank ? He directed me to another House , and I went there , with Holford , and the Man of the House told me he was above Stairs , and he would call him down . When he came down , I asked him how he did , and shook Hands with him , and desired him to sit down ; but that Instant he ran up Stairs again , and two of his Brother Bricklayer s stopp 'd me , and told me he was gone over the Tops of the House , and prevented my following him ; and I never could take him before . About a Year ago he pass 'd by my Door , in the Day-Time , with one Thomas Read , but no body appeared at Hand , and if I had started him , I should have done myself no Good . I have enquired every Year after him among the Brick-layers , and never could hear where he was , till I found him at the Horse and Groom by St. James 's Street , on the 10th of March last . When he was taken , he gave us ill Words , and struggled to get away from the Constable . The Money I lost was all I had in the World , except 30 s. Ralph King gave the same Account , that when Mr. Read was gone out , somebody knock 'd at the Door , and she , being alone in the House , asked , who was there ? And , upon being told that a Customer wanted a couple of Whips , she open 'd the Door , and two Men rush 'd in , one of whom she knew was the Prisoner ; for she had often seen him come to an ill House in the Neighbourhood . She said the other Man immediately ran her up against the Boards , and clapp 'd one Hand on her Mouth , and the other to her Throat , while the Prisoner took up a Leather Thong , and put it round her Neck ; that he gave the other Man the two Ends of the Thong to hold , and then lighted a Piece of Candle , which he took out of his Bosom , or Pocket , and went up Stairs ; that the Man who was left with her in the Shop , dragg 'd her by the Thong ( keeping one Hand on her Mouth ) into the Back part of the House , to a Sink in which stood a Pail , full of Water , into which he forced her Head ; that she once cry 'd out , upon which he kick 'd her , and endeavour 'd to stab her with a Pair of Scissars which hung at her Side , and did thrust them through all her Cloaths , to her Shift ; that the Prisoner made a low Whistle when he came down Stairs , upon which the Man who held her plung 'd her Head again into the Water , and then went away with the Prisoner ; leaving her so spent , that it was some time before she could get to the Door , to call the Neighbours , who , since the Fact , are some dead , and some removed ; that she sent for Mr. Read , who came home , and found his Boxes broke , and his money gone . She gave much the same Account as the former Witness had given of the Attempts to take the Prisoner . The Prisoner asked her , whether he did not come by her Door about three Years ago , and did not enquire of her if she knew him ? In answer to this , she said , About two Years ago he pass 'd the Door on a Sunday , and , upon her turning to look after him , he said - How do you do , old Woman , - you do n't know me ? The Witness reply 'd she did , that his Name was Constable , and that it was he who had robb 'd the House ; upon which he d - d her , and told her it was no more Sin to kill her , than to kill a Cat ; She said she saw him then go into a House three or four Doors off ( the Sign of the Fox ) and that she got a Constable , and went after him into the House , but he had made his Escape . Mary Holford confirmed the Account that Read gave of his being sent for , and finding Holford in a bad Condition , and his Boxes broke . Charles Wainwright , a Constable , gave an Account that he had a Warrant to seize the Prisoner about a Year ago , and had got Assistance in order thereto , but that they could not light of him . The Prisoner , in his Defence , said he always work 'd hard at the Bricklayer 's Business for his Living , and that his Character had never been stain 'd before ; that he generally work 'd in the Country during the Summer , and returned to Town in the Winter ; and a great Number of Persons giving him an extraordinary good Character , several of whom he had work 'd for , and had known him from his Apprenticeship , the Jury Acquitted him 311.
