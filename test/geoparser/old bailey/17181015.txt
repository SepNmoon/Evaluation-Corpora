Fletcher , the Deceas 'd , Mr. Heath and himself , had been Drinking together in a very Friendly manner at the Red-lion-Tavern in Richmond ; and being engag 'd in Conversation , it was mov 'd by some of the Company several times , that it was proper to break up , for that it grew late , and the Deceased , Mr. Heath and himself being to go to Istle worth , 't was thought it would be difficult to get passage over the Water , but the Deceased reply 'd he could do well-enough as to that , for being known to the Ferry-man , he could easily procure a passage . They staid till past 11 a Clock , then going down to the Ferry , the Ferry-man was gone to Bed , upon which the Deceas 'd told his Name , but the Ferry-man made them wait about half an Hour ; that upon saying a Shilling they went over , and landed in a very Friendly manner , and were walking to Istleworth , on the Path near the River side ; and as they were passing along , and discoursing concerning their Passage over , the Deceas 'd said that a Shilling was little enough , to which Mr. Heath reply 'd it was so , provided it had been done readily , and they had not been obliged to wait so long , that the Deceas 'd upon this took occasion to grow Warm , and Angry , and clapt his Hand to his Sword , but he ( this Witness ) holding him by the left Arm prevented him , tho ' he attempted it several times ; but all the while he did not perceive Mr. Heath attempts to draw , or meddle with his Sword . But the Deceas 'd at last growing so unruly and resolure , that he could not well hold him he let him go , and being by that time come near the Houses , walked before , but had not gone but a small Distance , before he heard the Clashing of Swords , upon which he immediately turned back , and when he came up to the Prisoner and Deceased , found them about 20 Yards distant from the Foot Path , and the Deceased fallen , and Mr. Heath helping him up . That then hearing some Men in a Boat , they called to them , and having gotten him into the Boat , he was carried to the Coffee House at Istleworth , whither he and Mr. Heath , and one of the Watermen walked , and not being able to get a Bed , they laid him upon the Watermen 's Tilts , and Cushions before the Kitchen Fire , and a Surgeon being immediately sent for , took care of him , and that the Deceased said to Mr. Heath , Tom , I am afraid thou hast Kill 'd me , but I freely forgive thee ; Mr. Health reply 'd he hoped not . He likewise added , that there had always been an intire Friendship between Mr. Heath and the Deceased and an , intimate familiarity , and never the least misunderstanding that he knew of , nor no just Provocation given by Mr. Heath at the time of this unhappy Accident . Bryan Cabe deposed , that he and his Partner rose about 12 a Clock that Night to go a Fishing , ( they being Fishermen ) and that being in their Boat , they heard some Gentlemen discoursing about the Ferry and a Shiiling , they thinking they might want to go over the Water , made towards them , and being come near the Bank , they heard the Clashing of Swords ; upon which they called out what are you doing there , Killing one another , and was answer 'd we hope not ; but they heard a Person Groan , and presently the Gentlemen called to them to come , and desired them to take the wounded Gentlemen into their Boat , and carry him to the Coffee-House at Istleworth ; that they made answer , they would come provided they would lay by their Swords , but said perhaps if we take the wounded Gentleman into the Boat , you will go away , and we shall have a dead Man to take care of ; But they replying , they would not , they took him in , and would have had Mr. Heath have gone with them , but he refused , saying , he was Wounded , and was afraid he should take Cold , but he would walk and meet them at the Coffee-House ; that thereupon his Mate walk 'd with him , and himself Rowed the Deceased to Istleworth ; and by the way , ask 'd him if he thought he was mortally wounded , to which he reply 'd , he knew not ; but if he was , he freely forgave him that did it . That when he came to Istleworth , Mr. Heath and Mr. Rutton came down , and they carried the Deceased to the Coffee-House , where Heath expressed a great deal of Concern for him , and Care and Tenderness of him , tending on him , frequently asking him how he did , what he would have , & c . and that the Deceased desired him to be easy , said he wanted nothing , perswaded him and Mr. Rutton to go to Bed . Bonas Willis the other Fisherman , confirmed what the former Evidence had said , adding that when they required them to lay by their Swords , Mr. Rutton took up the Deceased 's Sword off the Ground , and sticking it into the Ground broke it ; and that Mr. Heath went along with him to the Coffee-House , that he never attempted to go away , which he might have done if he had pleased , but sent him for a Surgeon , and was very careful of the Deceased , and refused to let the Surgeon meddle with his Wounds till he had dressed the Deceased , often looking upon him , and carefully observing whether he spit any Blood or not . Henry Packs , the Surgeon deposed that he being called by the last Evidence , went to the Coffee-House , just as the Clock struck one , but the Deceased not being then brought from the Boat , he walk 'd toward the Water-side as they were bringing him up , and they not being able to procure a Bed , laid him on some Chairs , and afterwards on some Tilts and Cushions before the Fire , and dress 'd his Wound , but did not then dare to Probe and Dilate it ; that Mr. Heath shew 'd a very great concern for the Deceas 'd , and much Affection and Tenderness towards him ; and tho ' he was Wounded in both Arms , refus 'd to be dress 'd till after he had dress 'd the Deceas 'd ; which he having done , did afterwards dress Mr. Heath of two Wounds , one quite through his left Arm ; and the other under his right Arm near the Arm-Pir , that Mr. Heath sent to Richmond to the Deceased 's Brother , who when he came , said to his Brother the Deceas 'd , in the name of God Sam , how came this Misfortune ? To which he reply 'd he did not know ; but several times desired his Brother if he dy 'd not to Prosecute . He added , that they having gotten him into Bed , he search 'd his Wound , and found it had penecrated the Abdoman ; and thereupon told them , that he apprehended it might be Mortal . His Brother sent for another Surgeon ; and all proper means was used , but he dy 'd the next Morning . Mr. Heath in his Defence exprest to the Court a great concern for the Deceased , said that his Death was a great Affiction to him , that there had been a long acquaintance and intimacy between them , that he had ferv 'd him upon all Occasions , and there never had been any Difference between them , till this Fatal time ; of which he gave this Relation , that she Deceased , Mr. Rutton , and himself , returning from Richmond to Istleworth , they met the Deceased 's Brother , Col. Barston , and Capt . Flescher , ( who were just come from London ) and went back with them to Richmond , to the Red-Lion-Tavern , and stay 'd there longer than they intended ; that Mr. Rutton several times express 'd some concern about getting over the Ferry . The Deceased often reply 'd , he need not trouble himself about that , for the Ferryman knew him , and would carry him over at any time . That the Tavern Boy lighted them to the Water-side . It was long before the Ferry-man would answer and consent to carry them over . The Deceased named his Name to him , but he would not know him ; at length with much entreaty , he suffer 'd his Boy to carry them over for a Shilling . That the Deceased seemed displeased at the Ferry-man 's want of respect towards him . That after they were Landed , and walking toward Istleworth , Mr. Rutton said he was glad they had gotten over the Ferry , altho ' they had so much trouble about it ; to which himself reply 'd , Ay , so was he , but those Ferry-men were surly Fellows , and knew no body at that time of Night without Money . The Deceased grew Angry , and said the Fellow deserv 'd a Shilling , to which he reply 'd so he did and more , if he had not made them wait so long on the Shore to make his Bargain . The Deceased said it was a Foolish thing to Dispute about it ; was Angry , offer 'd to draw his Sword several times ; which Mr. Ruttan prevented ; that they walk 'd on , he following the Deceased , and Mr. Rutton at about the distance of 3 or 4 Yards , and would have explain 'd what had been said , as not intending any Offence ; that the Deceased 's Anger encreasing after Mr. Ruttan left him , he told the Deceased , he hoped he would be of another Mind after he had Slept . He reply 'd no , I shall not , and if you say I am Drunk you lye ; and immediately drew his Sword , and pressing hard upon Mr. Heath , and endeavouring to close with him , received his Wound , and fell ; and that he himself received a Wounds from the Deceased,1 of them quite through his left Arm ; and had no way to save his Life , but by drawing his Sword to defend it . He had a great many Gentlemen , who appeared to speak as to his Behaviour and Temper . Those who were called , being well known to the Court , gave him the Character of a Peaceable , inoffensive Gentleman . The Jury upon hearing that whole matter , brought in their Verdict Manslaughter . [ Branding .

The Prosecutor deposed , that while she was abroad , her Chamber was broken open , and the Goods Stollen ; and that being informed that a Person was seen to come down Stairs , whose Person being described , the description answered to the Prisoner . Thomas Crossfield and Henry Lobb deposed , that they saw a Man come down the Stairs with some things within the Bosom of his Coat , and did verily believe it to be the Prisoner ; Lobb having known him before , when he used formerly to come to the Prosecutor . The Prisoner produced several Evidences , who gave an account from time to time where he was , so that it did not appear very probable that he committed the Fact ; upon hearing the whole matter , the Jury acquitted him . , of Chelsea , Gent . was indicted for the Murther of George Jenkinson , by giving him one mortal Wound with a Sword of the breadth of a quarter of an Inch and the Depth of Four Inches , the 22d of September last . The Evidence for the King deposed as follows : Mary Plat deposed that Mr. T - came home about 7 a Clock that Night , went to Support with the Family about 8 read Prayers in the Family about half an Hour after Nine , and went to Bed about Ten , as also did she and the rest of the Family , leaving the Footman below Stairs , who lay in the Kitchin , that about two or three Hours after the Footman came up and knocking at her Chamber-Door desired her to let him have a Candle ; accordingly she arose , struck a Light , and gave him a Candle asking him what he wanted it for ; to which he answered , for Mr. T - and he to look about the House , he being apprehensive that he had heard Thieves about the House ; she therefore having given him the Candle , shut her Chamber-Door last after him , being afraid , the House having been attempted to be broken open once or twice before . Joseph Lewis the Footman deposed , that he lying in the Kitchen for the Security of the House , heard as he thought , somebody about it , trample on the Gravel Walk in the Garden , just under the Window where he lay ; upon which he listning diligently for above a quarter of an Hour , and being confirmed in his Suspicion ; be having been ordered by his Mistress , if he heard any thing of that Nature , to go up and acquaint Mr. T - , accordingly he did , telling him he did believe there were Thieves about the House ; that Mr. T - thereupon asked him whether he was sure of it , to which he answered , he was ; who thereupon bid him go to the Maid and get a Candle , which he did , and Mr. T - Mose , put on his Night Gown and Slippers , taking his Sword in his Hand ; and he saying to Mr. T - , I have nothing in my Hand for a Defence , he bid him get a Club ; but he reply 'd there were two Pistols in Mr. T - 's Chamber , tho ' not Charged ; they went and took each of them one , and went down Stairs , and having looked about the House , and finding no body got in , they opened the Door , and went out , and saw the Deceased standing about 20 Yards from that end of the Garden , who seeing Mr. T - come out , made off , and Mr. T - thinking him to be a Thief that had attempted the House , follow 'd him with his Sword and Pistol in his Hand ; but he stand at the Door , least any Person should slip into the s ; but Mr. T - having followed the Deceased out of Sight , and not returning in the space of 5 or 6 Minutes , he seeing no body about , venturd Mr . T - . I searing some hurt might have befallen him ; and as he was going , met Mr. T - and the Deceased coming along , and the Deceased saying he was Wounded ; Mr. T - reply 'd , that if he had Wounded him , or done him any hurt , he was Sony and that Mr. T - desired him to assist him in carrying him to a House hard by in order to send for a Surgeon ; and as they went , Mr. T - telling him he attempted to wrest the Pistol out of his Hand , he made no reply ; but upon charging him with an attempt to break into the House , he reply 'd he was no Thief , but said D - n it , what a Fool was I . And as they were going along , of a sudden he fell down ; but by the Assistance of another Person that was there , they carried him to a House , Mr. T - sent him for a Surgeon , who came and let him Blood , but he bled no more than a Drop or two ; and they found he had a Wound in his Breast . Mr. Westerburn deposed , that he having had occasion to be out late that Night , coming a long after 12 a Clock , saw a Man lying in the Road groaning , and ask 'd him what he did there , but the Deceased made him no answer ; and Mr. T-not being far off , desir 'd him for God 's sake , to take some care of him . Whereupon they carry 'd him to a House , and sent for a Surgeon , who endeavour 'd to Bleed him as before ; that then they got him to Bed , dress 'd his Wound , and about a quarter of an Hour after be came to his Speech , but was very much disorder 'd in Drink , Cursed and Swore , and said what a Fool am I , I shall dye this Night ; told them where he liv 'd , and dyed about 5 a Clock that Morning . Mr. Johnson the Surgeon deposed , that the Footman came to him , and told him Mr. T - desir 'd him to come and take care of the Deceased , that he did come , and he being gotten to Bed , he dress 'd his Wound , which was on the side of his left Pap ; but he did not Speak , and so going away , desired that if he Spoke , that the People would come and tell him , and he would come again and apply proper means to help him ; but the next news he heard he was Dead . The Witnesses all agreed that Mr. T - shew 'd a very great concern and care for the Deceased 's welfare , tho ' he was not sensible but that he was a Robber as he took him to be . Mr. T - in his defence gave the same account that had been given by the Evidences for the King , adding that he seeing the Deceased run away upon seeing of him , was fully persuded he was the Person whom the Footman had heard about the House ; thereupon taking him for a Robber , he pursued him , and following him to the corner of a Street , where he seemed to turn up , and tho ' he might easily have escaped , he turned suddenly upon him , and tho ' he caution 'd him to keep off , telling him he suspected him to be a Thief , yet he Swore violently at him , clos 'd in with him , caught hold of his Pistol , and endeavoured to wrest it out of his Hand ; and in the Scuffle some way received the Wound , by pressing upon him , without any design of his , or so much as knowing he was Wounded . He called divers Gentlemen of Distinction and Reputation to his Character , who all gave him the Character of a very Civil , inoffensive Gentleman , never inclining to Quarrels or Passion ; but of such Affability as rendred his Conversation desirable , both by Superiours and Inferiours , And the Reverend Doctor King , Minister of the Parish , gave him the Character of a Young Gentleman very exemplary for Sobriety , coolness of Temper , Courtesy and Piety .
