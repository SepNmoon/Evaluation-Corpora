The Proceedings at the Sessions for London and Middlesex . AMongst such a multitude of various Crimes , the story of every petty Felony with its trivial Circumstances here examined or punisht , can not reasonably be expected to be published ; such an undertaking would be no less tedious than unuseful , and in some cases unfit : but as to whatever was transacted considerable or remarkable , this Sheet dares promise you a brief , yet sufficient , Account both of the manner of Fact , and what became of the Prisoner charged therewith . The first Relation we are to make , is of a very sad and unhappy accident . A Gentleman was indicted ( according to form in such cases ) for Murder ; but upon Evidence the business appeared onely thus : A Burglary about four or five a clock in the morning being made , or at least attempted , and discovered by the noise , and the people crying out Thieves , the person now tried , generously came forth of his Bed with his Sword in his hand to help hisFriends and seize the Robbers , but casually meets three or four Journymen-shoomaker s , who working hard by and taking the Alarm , came likewise running out with the like honest intentions : but in that hurry and passion , mutually mistaking each other for some of the Malefactors ( who in truth were all escaped before ) and the Gentleman demanding of the person deceased who they were ? and he , under that misapprehension , roughly replying , You shall know by our Actions , or to that effect , and withal striking him ; the now Prisoner concluding him one of the Thieves , unfortunately gave him a wound which occasion 'd his death : So that it appearing to be done partly by Misadventure and partly se Defendendo , he was wholly acquitted . Another person was arraigned for a Murder committed about three years ago neer Islington , and for which his own Brother , being above a twelvemonth since Convicted of Manslaughter , and not able to read when he had pray 'd the benefit of Clergy , was executed : But though this man was in his company when the fact was done , and some Circumstances seemed to lie heavie upon him , yet for want of cleer Evidence he was discharged : As likewise were two more concerning killing of a man neer Holborn , it not appearing that he received any blow or wound from either of them that might occasion his Death . But one for killing his Comrade by Tower hill , upon a Quarrel arising between them abouta Reckoning at an Ale-house , was found guilty of Manslaughter . A poor Charewoman intrusted sometimes to sweep the Hall of one of the City-Companie s , and scour their Pewter when need required , made hold at several times to exchange a considerable quantity thereof for Silver . She very penitently confest the Fact , and had endeavour 'd restitution as far as she could , begging mercy of the honourable Bench , which was afforded her . Another coming with three or four other Confederates to an Ale-house , some of them got up stairs , and breaking open a Chest of Drawers took away twenty Guinnies , five Rings , and several other things of value . The Prisoner being proved to be one of the Company , and that she paid the Reckoning , was Convicted . A notorious Criminal after many fair warnings and not a few Convictions , having some time since obtained the mercy of Transportation , finding , it seems , the place not to agree so well with her as that of Newgate , whereunto she had been so oft accustomed , or at least that the Customes of the Country were not fit for her Trade , Sugars and Tobacco not being so conveniently stolen , harbour 'd , or put off there , as Watches , Rings , Plate , Silks , & c. are here ; thought fit to come back and follow her old Profession of Shoplifting , being lately taken with a Scarf , which she alleadged stuck to her clothes when she went out of a shop at the Exchange , though the Jury were of opinion thatshe stole it : Which , together with her too early Return , 't is verily believed , may cause her to take a surer Transportation by a turn at Tyburn ; which , no doubt , will be much lamented as an untimely End , because it happen 'd no sooner . The next considerable , was an Indictment against a man and a woman , pretended to be intermarried , for Coyning . The woman had been an old Offender , and now no less than nine or ten Indictments found against her for Felonies ; being so frugal and industrious , as first to steal Plate , and afterwards make Money of it , to save the trouble of Exchange and the charge of Coynage . Yet as cunning as she was , she became accessary to her own Discovery : For upon promise of Secrecy , she tells an acquaintance that she knew some persons that had store of Cash , and were resolved to set up a private Mint ; and she would order it so , that he should surprize them at work , and then get a good sum for concealment , wherein she was to go snips . He seemingly consents , but honestly imparts it to a Gentleman to whose care and office it belongs to inspect such offences . Several times she came to him , and sometimes brought him new-coyn 'd Counterfeit-money to put off ; but still on pretences the business was not ripe , and perhaps then somewhat distrusting him , delay 'd the Discovery ; so that at last having learnt that she had taken a house about Hounslow for carrying on the Intrigue , he with a Warrant and Officers went down , and found her blowing the fire in a Roomwhere there were several sorts of Metals , divers pieces of stolen Plate , a Coyning-Press , and some other Tools , now produced in Court ; but her Husband was in another Room in bed . She did not much deny the Fact , but wholly clear 'd him ( to whom not above a fortnight before she had been married ) protesting that he was not privie to any of her actions of that kinde . The Court asking the man upon his Tryal whether he were content to part with his Wife , he , like a kind Husband , replied , I am very willing the Law should have its course : Better one than both . So that , he was acquitted , and she convicted of High Treason , and by Law to be Burnt . The Court had much trouble given them by a fellow and his Wife , the man being indicted for two Facts , stealing of a Mare , and of Linnen ; the woman for a Smock : both refused to plead , insomuch that the terrible Sentence of Pein fort & dure ( or pressing ) past , but not being recorded , and they on view of the Press , and Mr . Ordinary 's pressing and pious Exhortations not at once to cast away their lives and their souls , submitting themselves , were admitted to Tryal , and for want of exact proof acquitted on both Indictments . Another remarkable thing was of a lusty young wench , who coming to an Office of Intelligence to inquire for a Service , was by them directed to one at Westminster , and entertain 'd , pretending her self to be a Quaker , on which account her Master and Mistriss the more freelytrusted her ; but the second day in the evening she robb 'd them of several pieces of Plate , Clothes , & c. above the value of Fifty pound , and putting her self in mans apparel went off with the Prize , but was soon pursued and ( notwithstanding her disguise ) discovered , and in her masculine habit carried to Newgate ; but now appeared in a female dress . Before the Justice she accused one for taking the Goods by her Invitation or consent , and afterwards denied that he knew any thing of it , and charged another ; but still acknowledging 't was done by her privity , was found guilty of the Felony . Several persons were found guilty of Felony and burnt in the hand for stealing of Silver Tankards , & c. out of Victualing-houses : wherein there was little observable besides this , That people after so many Examples should be so far infatuated as to run the hazzard of forfeiting their Licenses , and losing their Plate , by exposing it in common use , meerly to gratifie their Pride , or a worse humour of Covetousness , which abateth the quantity of the Liquor , proportionably to the tempting quality of the Cups they vend it in . A woman in the Strand coming to buy one pair of Silk Stockings which she paid for , fearing ( it seems ) she might have a hard bargain , had been so kind to her self as to take about Seven and twenty pair more privately into her Apron without the useless Ceremony of asking the price ; but being discovered by a By-stander , was forc 'd to make legal satisfaction , and take an Acquittance for the same in her hand ; to which Squire Ketch vouchsafed to be a Witness , and subscribe his Mark . A lusty fellow arraign 'd for stealing a Horse , absolutely denied any knowledge of the business ; but being suddenly ask 'd what boot he had when he swapt him away , affirm 'd , But five and thirty shillings , which amounting to a plain Confession , he was brought in Guilty . Another for stealing of Goods pleaded the general Pardon he had lately obtained for another Robbery ; but the words thereof being read , and not extending to this Case , he was likewise Convicted , it serving rather to aggravate than extenuate his Fact . After this a woman was tried for the most unnatural Crime of Murdering her Bastard-child , and a man for the prodigious Trick of killing almost Threescore Sheep onely to steal Fourscore pounds of Tallow ; a piece of Villany never till within these few years practised : He pleaded guilty , and was Burnt in the hand . There were three Bargemen arraigned for Murder , drowning a boy in a Fisher-boat on the Thames . It was endeavoured to be proved that they did it wilfully ; but they alleadged , that by the violent current of the Tide they could not help it . The Jury found the matter of Fact specially , and left it to Judges to determine the Crime in point of Law . Several persons in custody for Robberies on the High-ways were not tried , there being no Prosecution in Middlesex against them ; but are to be sent to the respective Counties where they did the Facts , to take their Tryals at the Assizes . There were in all Five persons Condemned to die : Two men and two women ( old notorious and incorrigible Thieves ) to be Hang 'd , and one woman to be Burnt : Four set by , before Judgement , for Transportation ; Fourteen Burnt in the hand ; and Six for Petty Larceny to be Whipt .
