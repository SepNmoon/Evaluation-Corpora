He was a 2d time indicted on the Coroners 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Edward Newman ( Son-in-Law to the Deceased ) and Richard Wright deposed , that on Saturday about Midnight , going to see for the Deceased , who was a Watchman in Fetter-Lane , they met the Prisoner ( another Watchman ) with two Staves and two Lanterns , but no lighted Candle . Did you see my Father ? ( says Newman . ) Yes , ( said the Prisoner ) he lies dead at Dr. Lad 's Door in Castle-Yard . Dead ! Yes , dead , I saw him fall . And why did not you raise him up again , and call somebody to his Assistance ? D - ye , reply 'd the Prisoner , do you think that I kill 'd him ? One of the Staves and one of the Lanterns which the Prisoner then had in his Hands , appear 'd to be the same that the Deceased had at the time of his Death . Ann Hall ( Servant to Mr. Steel ) deposed , that about Midnight she sent their Boy for a Peck of small-coal , and held the Door a-jar till he came back ; and in the mean while she heard a hoarse Voice say , If you had been a Gentleman , I would have used you like a Gentleman ; but as you are a Watchman , I 'll use you , like a Watchman , if you do n't go about your Business . The Boy then came in , and told her that a Watchman was knock 'd down . Joseph Wait ( a Boy aged 13 ) deposed , that going for the Small-coal about half an Hour past 11 , he saw a Man with a Lantern coming by the Prisoner 's Watch-house in Castle-Yard . The Prisoner demanded , Who 's there ? And the other answered , A Friend . Whither are you going ? About my Business . D - yes , says the Prisoner , if you are sawcy , I 'll send you to Bridewell . Some other Words pass 'd , and the Prisoner came out , knockt him down at Dr. Lad 's Door , and then went into his Watch-house again . Eliz Reeves ( in Magpye-Yard near Castle-Yard ) deposed , that after 12 o'Clock , she heard a Cry of Stop Thief , and looking from her Window , saw two Men run by with Staves and Lanterns , and one of them said in a hoarse Voice , Now I have ye , and I 'll smash ye By G - . They pass 'd the End of the Yard , and one of them returning , was met by two or three more , who said to him , Did be knock down you , or you him ? The hoarse Voice answer 'd , I knock 'd him down . It appeared that the Prisoner was very hoarse at that time . John Glover deposed , that hearing of the Death of the Deceased , he went to see him , and going through Magpye-Yard , he met the Prisoner with two Staves and two Lanterns , and said to him , Lord bless me ! how came this Accident ? Why , said the Prisoner , he came by my Stand , and I called to him ; but be made as Answer , and so I stept out and took him a Knock . These Words raised 2 Suspicion ; upon which the Prisoner was apprehended , and committed to Bridewell . Francis Hemmit deposed , that a little before 12 the Prisoner came drunk to his Stand , ( at Mr. Bird 's Door in Castle-Court ) and without any Provocation began to be very quarrelsome , swearing , calling him ill Names , and striking him two or three times . Hemmit desired him to get out of his Beat , or he 'd make him forfeit Sixpence . ( Such a Forfeit being , customary among the Watchmen , if one comes into the other 's Beat . ) Mr. Bird then came to the Door , and threaten 'd the Prisoner that he would charge a Constable with him , and send him to Bridewell ; upon which the Prisoner was very free of his ill Language to Mr. Bird , and concluding with G - damn it I 'll make a Sacrifice of somebody to Night ; he went away . Great Part of this was confirm 'd by Mr. Bird himself . John Clark deposed , that coming to see the Deceased , who lay on the Steps of Dr. Lad 's Door , he happen 'd to spy something White within Dr. Lad 's Palisades , and dragging it out , found it to be a Piece of the Deceased 's Neckcloth ; for by comparing it with the other Piece that was then about the Deceased 's Neck , it appear 'd to have been torne from it , and afterwards thrown over the Palisades . Both the Pieces were produced in Court , and matched exactly . Robert Lugg deposed , that coming into Castle-Yard , he saw the Deceased lying dead on the Stone Steps , his Lantern with a lighted Candle in it , and his Staff standing by him , and the Prisoner walking to and fro before him . He asked the Prisoner if he knew who it was that lay there , or how he came by his Death ; to both which Questions the Prisoner answer 'd in the Negative . He ( this Deponent ) then went away , and coming that Way again soon after , he found the Deceased lying in the same Place ; but neither his Lantern , Staff , nor the Prisoner , were then to be seen there . Other Witnesses confirmed that Particular of the Prisoner 's owning that he saw the Deceased fall , and that he ( the Prisoner ) was a very abusive quarrelsome Fellow . Mr. Keatly the Surgeon depos 'd , that on the Wednesday after the Death of the Deceased , ( which was on Saturday Night ) he view 'd the Body , and making an Incision cross wise on the Left Side of the Head , he found a Contusion about the Breadth of a Shilling . He then took off the Pericranium , but found no Fracture in the Skull . There was also a deep Bruise in the Left Shoulder but he thought it very unlikely for a Contusion in that Place to prove mortal . As for the Bruise in the Head , he thought it might probably be the Cause of his Death ; but he could not be positive . It appear 'd , he said , to be done by a Blow with a Staff : But it being demanded if it was not possible that such a Bruise might be received by a Fall , he answered , Yes . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that the Deceased had been subject to the Apoplexy ; that he had often seen him fall into such a Fitt , and that it was in such a Fitt that he dropt down at Dr. Lad 's Door . That soon after , a Gentleman coming up the Yard , he went to light him in at Doors ; at which time 2 or 3 Fellows coming out of Holborn , took up the Deceased 's Lantern and Staff which stood by him , and ran away with'em , which he ( the Prisoner ) seeing , ran after'em thro ' Magpye-Yard , and cry 'd , Stop Thief . They finding that he pursu 'd 'em , threw away the Staff and Lantern , and got off . He took 'em up and brought 'em back , which was the Cause of his being seen by several with 2 Staves and 2 Lanterns . Mr. - depos 'd , that coming up Castle-Yard , he saw the Prisoner walking about very drunk , and the Deceased lying on Dr. Lad 's Steps , whom he at first thought to be drunk too ; but the Prisoner assured him that he was really dead . The Prisoner then lighted him to his Door , and 2 or 3 Men coming by the Deceased , took away the Lantern and Staff . The Prisoner pursu 'd 'em , and as drunk as he was , brought the Lantern and Staff back again ; at which time some other Watchmen ( whose Depositions have already been mentioned ) met him with the 2 Staves and 2 Lanterns . He added , that he believed that these Words , I 'll smash you by G - were spoken by the Prisoner to one of the Men that took the Deceased 's Staff and Lantern . Mr. Steel depos 'd , that his Boy Jos . Wait had told his Wife , that he knew nothing of the Matter , but gave his Evidence before the Coroner by the Maid Anne Hall 's Persuasions : That he knew the Boy to be much addicted to Lying ; for which , and some other Misdemeanors , he had since turn 'd him away . Anne Hall was then called up again , and said , that as she had no Reason to do it , so she never did , in the least , persuade the Boy to say any thing about it ; but that the Boy said she persuaded him , merely to escape a severe Whipping , which his Mistress and young Master threatned him with . The Boy was then called up a second time ; He said his Mistress was going to strip him stark naked ; and that Robert steel ( his young Master ) took the Horse-Whip , and Struck him once with it , threatning not only to whip him then in a terrible Manner , but afterwards to send him to Bridewell , except he would confess that the Maid had persuaded him to swear , as he did before the Coroner ; and that the Fear of such Treatment made him say any thing that they desired of him . Rob Steel acknowledged , that knowing the Boy to be addicted to Lying , he did strike him once with a Whip , and threatned him farther , if he did not confess the Truth , which was all that he desired of him . Stephen and Samuel Candy , ( Sons to the Deceased ) and several others , in Contradiction to the Prisoner 's Assertion , depos 'd , that the Deceased was never known to have a Fitt of the Apoplexy , not was it likely that he tell down being drunk , for that they saw him but about an Hour before his Death , and he was then as sober as a Judge , besides , it could never be thought that an Apoplectick Fitt would fear the Deceased 's Neckcloth , and throw Part of it over the Palisades . Charles Walter depos 'd , that the Prisoner had been his Servant some time ago , and then behaved himself like an honest , harmless , inoffensive Fellow . One or two more spoke in his Behalf to the same Effect . The Jury , after a long Consideration , found him guilty . Death . Anthony Dumont , of S. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a Silver-Hilted Sword , value 25 s. and a Hat value 14 s. the Goods of Henry Baxter , on the 19th of Aug. last . The Prisoner being a Frenchman , and understanding no English , an Interpreter was sworn upon the Tryal . Mr. Baxter depos 'd , that he living at the French Resident 's in Suffolk-street , the Prisoner ( whom he had some Knowledge of ) came thither to get a Pass for France . He ( the Prosecutor ) going up Stairs , the Prisoner , before he came down again , was gone away with the Sword and Hat that hung on a Peg below , and had left his own Hat in the room of 'em . By making Enquiry , and describing him , he was afterwards taken by a Soldier in Southwark , with the Sword-Hilt in his Pocket . He confessed the Fact , and the Court granted him a Pass to his Majesty 's Plantations . William Lipsat , of S. Giles 's , in the Fields was indicted for stealing in the House of Robert Kelway 57 Guineas and a half , 29 Carolus 's , 5 Jacobug 's , 3 Moidores , 6 Pieces of Silver value 12 s. a Silver Buckle set with Stones , and 2 Purses value 12 d. the Goods of Robt .

Kelway depos 'd , that going out of Town on the 9th of Dec. he left the Money and Goods in the Indictment lock 'd up safe in the Drawers of his Scrutore , and remaining the next day , he was told that his Servant ( the Prisoner ) had robb 'd him , and was committed to the Round-House . Edward Higginson depos 'd , that about 11 at Night the Prisoner came to him , and desired to lie with him , which he granted , and the next day the Prisoner shew 'd him a Watch , 2 Snuff Boxes , ( which he had bought the day before ) several Pocket-Pieces , and other Things , which raised a Suspicion in the other that they were not honestly gotten . He therefore caused him to be apprehended . The Constable and Watchman depos 'd , that upon searching the Prisoner , they found 50 Guineas and a half , 30 Broad Pieces , 3 Moidores , 2 Snuff-Boxes , and a Common-Prayer Book . He confes 'd before Justice Ellis , that he broke open his Master 's Scrutore , and took from thence the Goods mention 'd in the Indictment .

He returned about 6 in the Evening , and soon understood that she was eloped with the Prisoner . The Chest of Drawers were fast lock 'd , and the Key left in the Window ; but when he came to open 'em , all was gone . When his Wife Jane came home again , she confessed that she had taken the Money away . The Prisoner desired that the Prosecutor or his Wife might be asked , if they did not know that Plate was his , ( the Prisoner 's , ) and that he lent it to Jane the Prosecutor 's Wife before her last Marriage . Mr. Barns did not care that his Wife Jane should be examined in Court . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . Alexander Cameron , of the Savoy , was indicted for the Murder of Tho . Crew , by giving him one mortal Wound between the 2 Forefingers , of the Length of 1 Inch , and Depth of 2 Inches , of which he languished till the 3d of January , and then died . He was a 2d time indicted on the Statute of Stabbing : And a 3d time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . It appeared by the Evidence of the Brother and Widow of the Deceased , and several others , that the Deceased kept a Victualling-Cellar , and that the Prisoner came down in the Night and enquired for - Foreside , a Soldier . The Deceased 's Wife said to him , You have no Occasion to ask that Question , for you know as well as I that he 's in the Savoy . The Prisoner then Shaking his Fist , reply 'd , D - your Blood , you Bitch , I 'll be revenged of you for what you said to him . Some of the Company desired him to be either quiet , or go away ; but he continued very troublesome . A Recruit , who was then drinking in the Cellar , stept to him , and thrust him up Stairs . In the Struggle the Prisoner drew his Sword , push 'd at the Recruit , and scratched him in the Neck . The Recruit retired , and the Deceased seeing him bleed , went to the Stair foot and called the Prisoner Rogue and Villain , for drawing upon a naked Man . You Black-guard Dog , says the Prisoner , come hither , and I 'll serve you the same Sauce . Upon this , the Deceased stept up 2 or 3 Stairs towards the Prisoner , ( there being but 7 Stairs in all ) and the Prisoner standing at the Top , thrust his Sword down , and stuck it into the Hand of the Deceased , between the 2 Forefingers . The Prisoner then went away , but returned several times that Night to the Stair Head , calling'em ill Names , flourishing his Sword , and swearing that he would stab every one of them . The Deceased received this Wound about 7 of the Clock on Monday Night . They washed it with Geneva ; his Hand swell 'd , and was very painful .

They drank Geneva till they could hardly see one another ; and then taking out his Purse to pay the Reckoning , he found but 7 Guineas left out of the 16 .

They got up again ; he called her his Dear Mother ; she bade him kneel down , ask her Blessing , and kiss her * * * . He obey 'd . But hark ye me , Son , says she , I understand that you lead a very fine Course of Life : You make a common Practice of getting drunk , and spending all that you have upon naughty Women , while your poor honest Wife and Daughters here , ( pointing to the Prisoners ) have had nothing to eat these 3 days . I have a good mind to whip you severely . Indeed Mamma , it 's no such thing . What , do you deny it , Sirrah ? Here , fetch me the Rods . Will you do so any more ? No , never .

However , he carried them to the Round-house , and from thence before Mr. Justice Ellis , where they were desir 'd to shew the Receipt for the 50 l. paid to Sir John Tash . Pickers said it was in his Pocket-Book , which was in the Coat that he pluck 'd off when he shifted himself at the Round-House ; and that Packer 's Wife had taken that Coat to her Lodgings in Parker's-lane in Drury-Lane , or else to his own Lodgings in Cross-Court , which was not far distant from the other .

There they were found by the Prosecutor . The Knife was branded in the Handle with C.C . It was produced in Court , and sworn by the Owner to be the same that the Prisoners took from him . J. Winsmore deposed , that he went with the Prosecutor to see if he knew the Prisoners in New-Prison . They saw Pickner hast , who said , I know what you come about ; I am a dead Man : I was advis 'd to make myself an Evidence against Packer . I might have done it last Sunday ; but now it 's too late . - French deposed , that on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday , the Prisoners hired two Horses of him , one a Grizzled-grey , and the other a Bay : At each time they came about 4 in the Afternoon , and always told him they went only to the Upper Flask at Hampstead . They commonly return 'd between 10 and 11 , as in particular they did that Saturday Night the Robbery was committed , and came in then very dirty and splash 'd . The Prisoners said nothing in their Defence , only Picken told the Court , that he found the Knife in Smithfield . Elizabeth Mason deposed , that the Prisoners came into her House at Cow-Cross one Minute before 10 o'Clock that Saturday Night : She remember 'd the Time exactly , because Puken ask 'd for her Husband ; and she look 'd upon the Clock , that she might tell her Husband at what Time Picken had been to enquire him ; and that she did not observe that they were dirty when they came in .

Says Hall , I do n't like the Looks of those Fellows ; I believe they are Bailiffs . Prithee , John , step over and observe 'em . It being a Moon-light Night , he went by them , looked wishful in their Faces ; and returning to Hall , told him , that they looked more like Thieves than Bailiffs . Upon this they watch 'd 'em , and by and by they saw Vaughan go along with a Bundle upon his Shoulder . They stopt him . He cry 'd out , Thieves ! Rogues ! do you design to rob me ? They told him they knew who those Goods belong 'd to . Are they yours , says he ? No , said they , but we can bring you to the right Owner quickly . Gentlemen , be but easy , and you shall go Halves . No , we will have all . All ? What wo n't you leave me one Cap ? Pray , Gentlemen , let me have but a Cap , and take the rest betwixt you .

After Dinner they went to Young Man 's Coffee house and from thence to the Mitre Tavern , to take a Parting Glass ; for Mr. Olivant ( who was an Officer in General Evans 's Regiment of Dragoons ) was to go the next day for Dorchester . They drank pretty briskly , and all appeared friendly and pleasant . About 11 o'Clock , part of the Company went away , and only Mr. Olivant , Mr. Lewis and himself , were left together . Soon after they were gone , Mr. Lewis desired Mr. Olivant to pay him 53 l. that he ow 'd him . Mr. Olivant express 'd a Surprize , that his intimate Friend should , without giving him any previous Notice , make such a Demand , at a time , when it could not be thought , that he should have such a Sum about him ; and added , that as he was obliged to go out of Town the next day , he could not possibly have Time to provide the Money ; but he would either remitt the Sum to him when he came to the Regiment , or give him a Note for Value upon a Relation , payable in London . Neither of these Proposals would satisfy the Deceased for he still insisted upon present Payment . He , this Evidence , then told him , that he himself would discharge the Debt the very next day , if Mr. Olivant would give him a Note to pay the same Sum at six Months after Date . To this they both acquiesced and appeared to be good Friends again . And then he , this Evidence , fell asleep , but was suddenly awaked by a Quarrel betwixt the other two . He looked up , and saw that the Deceased had left his Place , and was gone round the Table to Mr. Olivant , at whom he that instant made a Pass with his drawn Sword , which the other put by with his Hand , and by that means received a Wound . He got up to part them ; but before he could effect it , they closed , and fell down , Mr. Lewis under Mr. Olivant ; and then he saw Mr. Olivant 's drawn Sword upon the Ground , which he did not see before . Tho Maccarthey the Drawer depos 'd that when Mr. Olivant , Mr. Lewis , and the other Gentlemen came , they all appeared to be very good Friends , and be spoke a Supper . About 12 o'Clock , he heard a Disturbance , ran up , and found the Deceased and Mr. Olivant upon the Ground , the former being undermost . He and the Major 's Servant , who followed him , help 'd 'em up , and then he ran for a Surgeon . At his Return , he found them in another Room . The Deceased was lying upon a Bed , and Mr. Olivant said to him , Dear Lewis , I am afraid you are a dying Man ; My Life is at Stake . I beg you to speak what you know . Was not your Sword drawn first ? The Deceased answered , Ay , Ay , I forgive you freely , and then killed Mr. Olivant . This Evidence farther said , that the Room in which the Misfortune happened , was very small , and except the Deceased had risen from his Seat , and gone round the Table to Mr. Olivant , it was hardly possible for them to have fallen together in the Place and Manner that he found them in . John Mills , Servant to the Major , depos 'd , that he followed the last Evidence into the Room , saw a drawn swords upon the Floor , and raising the Deceased , they convey 'd him into another Room , where Mr. Olivant said to him several times , Did not you draw first ? And the Deceased answered as often , I forgive you . Mr Olivant 's Left Hand was bloody . The Sword of the Deceased was produced in Court , and appeared to be stained with Blood . John Martin , Surgeon , depos 'd , that upon Searching the Wound , he found the Sword entred the Left Side of the Belly , pierced thro ' the Diaphragma and part of the Lungs , and came out under the short Ribs , there being a considerable Quantity of Blood extravasated . The Deceased died about 8 o'Clock in the Evening , and that Wound was the Cause of his Death . Before he died , he said to Mr. Olivant , I forgive you . John Bowler depos 'd , that being sent for to the Deceased , he stay 'd by him from 3 o'Clock till he died ; betwixt which Times , a certain Gentleman came in , to whom the Deceased ( without being asked the Question ) said , 'T was Mr. Olivant 's Fault , because he would not pay me the Money . Mr. Olivant in his Defence made no material Variation from the Account that Major Nortliffe had already given , but added , that when the Major was asleep , the Deceased started up from his Seat , drew his Sword , came round the Table , and push 'd at him two or three times ; and the Room being very narrow , and the Door opening inwards , he could not retreat without manifest Danger of his Life , which put him under a Necessity of defending himself , the Consequence of which proved very unhappy ; tho ' at the same time he was ignorant when or how the Deceased received the Wound . Dr. Furlong deposed , that after the Deceased was wounded , Mr. Olivant laid his Hand upon his Shoulder , and said , Lewis , Lewis , Was not you the Aggressor ? And the Deceased answer 'd , I forgive you ; 't was all fair . Mrs. Carter at the Mitre Tavern depos 'd , that coming into the Room where the Deceased lay wounded , Mr. Olivant said to the Company , Take Notice of what he says ; and then turning to the Deceased , he said , Did not you draw first ? The Deceased answer 'd , I forgive you . Mr. Olivant return 'd , That 's not what I ask you , my Life 's at Stake : Did you draw first ? To which the Deceased reply 'd , Ay , Ay , I forgive you . Capt . Edward Hawley and Capt . Newton deposed , that they said to the Deceased as he lay on the Bed , they were sorry to find him in that Condition , and asked him how it happen 'd ; and the Deceased answer 'd , It was my own seeking , I freely forgive him , and desire there may be no manner of Prosecution . The Rt . Hon . the Lord Viscount Lonsdale inform 'd the Court , that he had known Mr. Olivant about four Years , in all which time he maintained a fair Character , not being addicted to quarrel , but distinguishing himself by an agreeable Civllity and good Nature . Sir Wilfrid Lawson deposed , that having known Mr. Olivant three Years , he had constantly found him to be a Person of a happy , peaceable Disposition , and far from being quarrelsome . General Evans gave Mr. Olivant the Character of an open , peaceable , generous Gentleman , one that was not backward in paying his just Debts ; and that on the contrary , the Deceased was very turbulent , and subject to quarrel in his Drink , for which Reason he had desired him to dispose of his Commission . Col. Lanoe , in the Behalf of Mr. Olivant , deposed , that he knew him to be a Man of a pleasant , even Temper , and that the Deceased more the opposite Character , he frequently being ( especially when in Drink ) very troublesome in the Regiment . Many other Persons of Distinction were ready to appear in Favour of Mr. Olivant ; but the Court thought it unnecessary . Manslaughter . Burnt in the Hand .

Sha n't we drink together ? And the Prisoner answer 'd , with all my Heart . They went in together , and he ( this Deponent ) privily sent for a Constable . The Prisoner told him , that he bought the Gelding very honestly ; but if he was uneasy about it , he would take the Gelding again and give him the Mare that stood at the Door instead of it . John Row ( at the Two Spies and Grapes in King-street near the Seven Dials ) deposed , that about 7 in the Morning the Prisoner came there to drink , and hung his Mare at the Door : They having some Suspicion of him , sent for Higgins , and afterwards for Richard Lad , the Owner of the Mare .

Why then , says he , D - your Blood , you Bitch , I 'll have your Life . She beg 'd of him not to murder her ; but he struck her three or four times with a Stick , and knock 'd her down . He then turn 'd up her Petticoats to feel for her Pocket , and did what he would with her . But finding no Money , he beat her again cruelly , and swore that he 'd do her Business for her ; and not withstanding her Cries and Entreaties , he drag 'd her into the great Road , laid her in the Cart-rout , beat her again , and took away her Cloak .

John Bowler was a 3d time , and John Tibbs a 2 d time , indicted , for that they , with several others , did break and enter the House of Henry Brooksbank , and take from thence 12 lb . of Tobacco val . 18 s. 5 Quarts of Brandy val . 7 s. 6 d. 5 Bottles val . 10 d. and 14 s. in Money ; the Money and Goods of H. Brooksbank , on the 15th of August last , about Eight in the Afternoon . Brooksbank and his Wife deposed , that he having arrested a Man , the Prisoners , and several more of the New Minters , came to his House in Whitechappel , about Nine at Night . The outer Door was open , but the Sash-Door within was shut ; but they forced an Entrance , and Bowler knockt him down , and were very abusive . Some of them , ( but not the Prisoners ) had their Faces black , and their Shirts over their other Cloaths . As soon as they were gone , the Money and Goods in the Indictment were missing . The Jury found them guilty of Felony to the Value of 4 s. 10 d. Transportation . Benjamin Goddard , of S. Dunstan 's in the East , was indicted , that he , with Samuel Axtell and John Bollan , did assault Robert Wise on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Pair of Crystal Buttons , set in Silver , val . 5 s. on the 8th of Nov. last . Benjamin Goddard and Richard Rustead , were indicted for a Trespass in conspiring to charge Robert Wise with an Intention to committ Sodomy with John Bollan , and by that means extorting from the said Robert Wise a Diamond Ring value 8 l. and several Sums of Money . Robert Wise deposed , that on Sunday the 8th of Nov. about Six at Night , as he was making Water at Bear-Key , a Man ( whose Name he has since heard is Bollan ) came to him , and thrust his Hand into his Breeches , when immediately two others , ( Goddard and Axtell ) started upon them from behind some Hogsheads , and cry 'd , Now , by G - , we have got him ; - A Sodomite ! A Sodomite ! He was very much surprized at the Charge ; which they perceived and swore that if he would not make it up with them , they would presently carry him him before the Justice , and take their Oaths that they saw him going to commit the Fact with Bollan . He was in a great Surprize , and assured them , that if they would let him go , he would give them a Pair of Crystal Buttons . Goddard took them , but swore that they must have something else , or it would be the worse for him , and so they followed him home . They told him , as he was going in , that if he did not come down again quickly , and bring them some Money , they would carry him to Newgate directly . He promised them to try what he could do . They bade him borrow a Guinea of the Maid , if he could get it no otherwise . He brought them two York-Building Lottery-Tickets , of 30 s. value each , with which they went away . At two other times they brought the Prisoner Rustead with them , and extorted 15 s. from him . On the 17th of Dec. at Night , the two Prisoners waited for his coming out ; and in Gutter-Lane Rustead clapt him on the Shoulder , and swore that they had now got a Warrant to carry him to Newgate ; and they would certainly execute it , if he did not help them to 4 l. for Goddard was going to live in the Country , and wanted a little Money to fit him out . He told them , he believed that he had got 40 s. about him , and he would give them that , if they would never trouble him again : They swore they never would . He gave them the Money , and as soon as they had got it , they insisted upon his making it up 4 l. But still promising , with repeated Imprecations , that if he comply 'd , they would never come after him any more . At last he gave them the other 40 s. and so they parted for that time : But the next Night , hearing the Bell ring , he went down to see who was at the Door ; he opened it , and saw nobody at first ; but quickly Rustead stept up , and said he must needs speak with him , and would have taken him out . He was unwilling to go , and therefore desired the other to come in , which he did . Rustead then swore that Goddard ( whom he called Brother ) was gone out of Town , and had left some Rings in Pawn , and he must have 4 l. to redeem them . He found 't was in vain to put Rustead in mind of what he swore the preceding Night . But having no Money about him , he gave him ( tho ' with great Reluctance ) a Diamond Ring from off his Finger , with which he went away . But the other being vexed with himself for parting with the Ring , went after Rustead , to try if he could get it again , upon the Promise of some Money . He had gone but a little way , when , to his great Surprize , he found Rustead and Goddard talking together . They told him , they must and would have 40 s. more , or it should be the worse for him . This occasioned a little Disturbance ; and a Boy coming by , and hearing something of the Matter , Oh ! says he , I know one of these Fellows , his Name is Rustead , he uses the Walks in Moorfields ; which the Prisoners hearing , ran away , and he ( this Evidence ) never saw 'em again , till they were apprehended , which was not long after . It appeared that the Prisoners were drinking together at the Farthing Pye-house by Moorfields , from whence they sent a Man to sell the Diamond Ring . This Fellow happening to offer it to the very Goldsmith of whom the Prosecutor bought it , the Goldsmith knew it again , and stopt him , and he discovered where the Prisoners were waiting ; by which means they were presently apprehended . Rich Baily the Constable depos 'd , that Goddard own 'd that he took the Buttons from the Prosecutor ; and that upon his Information he found Bollan and Axtell , and apprehended 'em ; but they being bailed , have since fled for it . That Rustead own 'd , that he knew that the other three had followed that Practice of getting Money several times before , and that he himself had most of the Money from the Prosecutor . The Prisoners than made their Defence . Goddard deny 'd that it was he that took the Buttons , but said , that accidentally meeting the Prosecutor , ( to whom he was before a Stranger ) he ( the Prosecutor ) told him where he lived , and that he had twice committed Sodomy with Bollan . Rustead said , that meeting with Goddard in Moorfields , Goddard told him what the Prosecutor had said , upon which the Prosecutor took him by the Arm , and said , Pray do n't go to my Master 's House to disgrace me , for I am a young Gentleman , and it will be my Ruin ; and at the same time gave them Money not to discover it . It appeared highly improbable , that any one in his Senses should confess such things to Strangers , and then tell them where he lived . The Jury acquitted Goddard of the Robbery , but found them both guilty of the Misdemeanor . [ Fine . See summary . ] [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] John Sanders , of S. James 's Westminster , was indicted for feloniously receiving a Hartshorn handled Hanger and Belt , value 16 s. the Goods of John Mills , on the 17th of Oct. last , he knowing the same to be stoln . Guilty . Transportation . William Green , of Stepney , was indicted , for that e , with Cha Towers , John Bowler , John Warren , alias Warthern , and others , did break and enter the House of Geo Westwood , and take from thence a Hatchet val . 2 s. the Goods of Rich Lillington , on the 28th of Aug. last . It appear 'd that the Prisoner , with other New Minters , came to the Prosecutor 's House , and Bowler took a Hatchet from the Prosecutor 's Wife ; but the Jury not thinking it to be taken with a felonious Intent , they acquitted him . William Green was a 2d time indicted for a Riot and Assault upon William Jones . W. Jones deposed , that on the 26th of Nov. last , about 7 in the Evening , he was drinking at the Tewksbury-Church Alehouse in Whitechappel , when the Prisoner and others came in , knock 'd him down , and drag 'd him thro ' Whitechappel to their usual Place of Rendezvous in the New Mint . There they stript him naked , and wore Sixpenny worth of Rods to the Stumps in whipping of him , and he believed he received a thousand Lashes . Then they put on his Cloaths again , and threw him into a Pit fill 'd with Human Excrement , and other Filth , in which they dipt the Rods when they whipt him . There they duck 'd him several times , and as they took him out , the Prisoner held him up by the Hair , and thrust a Turd into his Mouth ; and then they attended him part of the Way home , with lighted Links . The Prisoner , when carry 'd before Sir Isaac Tillard , desired to be made an Evidence against Mr. Saintloe . Another Witness deposed , that he saw the Prosecutor when he came back , attended with near two hundred of the Mob ; but he was so cover 'd over with Excrement , that he could see no Part of him but his Teeth . Guilty . [ Fine . See summary . ] [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] Richard Edwards , was indicted for a Riot and Assault on Joseph Robinson . Joseph Robinson ( who was the first Bailiff that underwent the Discipline of the New Mint ) deposed , that on the 3d of Nov. last , between Seven and Eight at Night , William Green ( followed by several others ) came into his House , and said , G - D - my Body , you are my Prisoner . They carry 'd him to the Sun at Green-Bank in the New Mint ; they laid him a cross a Joint-Stool , and whipt him , giving him ( he believes ) 3 or 400 Lathes , and then put him into the Pit , which was about six Foot long , and three or four Foot broad , and over it hung the Sign of the Hand and Tipstaff . When they thought that he had been sufficiently soak 'd in the Pit , they were going to take him out ; but the Prisoner came to him , and cry 'd , G - D - your Blood , you shall duck two or three times for my Pleasure ; and so made him plunge in again , and roll about ( he said ) like a Sow in hot Weather . Guilty . [ Fine . See summary . ] [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] Henry Ireson and Thomas Earle , were indicted for appearing arm 'd in a riotous and tumultuous manner , in the King 's Highway , to the great Disturbance of his Majesty 's Subjects . Michael Baslow deposed , that Earle , follow 'd by several others , came to his Door with a Club , shod with Iron , and said , G - D - ye , I 'll kill you one Day or another ; but he ( this Evidence ) ran up Stairs , and got away over the Houses . Robt Sippet deposed , that being taken by the New Minters , they carry 'd him along in Triumph , with Colours flying , and Violins playing before them . Earle was with them , and cry 'd , D - ye , go along you Rogue ! You have arrested me many a time , and now I 'll kill you . But John Tibbs , ( who was convicted yesterday ) said to him , Go Home about your Business , Mr. Sippet , nobody shall hurt you ; - They have made Game enough of you already . And so he escaped the Discipline . There was no Evidence that affected Ireson , and therefore the Jury acquitted him , and found Earle guilty . [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] The Tryals being over , the Court proceeded to give Judgement as follows , viz . Received Sentence of Death , Nine .
