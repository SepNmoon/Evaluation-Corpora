See summary . ] 3. John Bennet , of Hammersmith , was indicted for the Murder of George Main , on the High-Seas , near Sheerness , in England , by beating him with a Stick call 'd a Tiller , on the Head , Back , Shoulder , and Arms , and thereby giving him several Mortal Wounds on the 7th of November , of which Wounds he languish 'd till the 2d of December following , and then dy 'd , in the Hamlet of Hammersmith . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . G. Sugg . The Prisoner and I are Fishermen , we live at Hammersmith , the Deceas 'd ( a Boy about 11 Years old ) was his Apprentice . On ( the 28th of last October ) the Day before my Lord Mayor's-Day , I agreed to go out a Fishing with the Prisoner , and I was to have a Groat in the Shilling of what we made of the large Fish , and half the small Fish , as is usual . We went from Hammersmith to Fulham , and there he left me 3 Days , while he went to his Wife to get some Money of her , and then he came to me , and we went to Sheerness ; but getting no Fish there , we went to Feversham , and from thence to Woolstaple-Bay , where having caught some Fish , we return 'd to Feversham to sell them . We set the Boy on Shore with the Fish , and then put off again ; but the Shore being very slippery the Boy let the Fish fall , upon which the Prisoner desir 'd me to put too again ; he went to the Boy , and beat him with a Rope , and return 'd to the Boat , when presently the Boy fell down again ; the Prisoner again went a-shore and beat him , and so return 'd a second time-to the Boat ; the Boy happen 'd to fall a third time , upon which the Prisoner went a-shore once more , and he and the Boy went away together . The Boy came on Board again at Night , but the Prisoner did not come till next Morning , and threaten 'd to beat the Boy for asking some Body at Feversham for a bit of Bread . Says the Boy , I hope there was no harm in asking for a little Bread when I was very hungry ? Well , says the Prisoner , I wo n't beat you now , but I 'll give it you by and by when we come into Queenborough-Grounds . So we row 'd through Queenborough-Grounds by Milton-Creek 's Mouth towards Sheerness ; then the Prisoner took a 2 Inch Rope , and splitting it into 7 Strands , he ty 'd 3 Knees in each Strand , and stripping the Boy stark naked ( except only his Shoes and Stockings ) he whipt him with this Cat of nine Tails , for I believe , full three Quarters of an Hour by the Clock , and then 2 Fishermen came up , and said , Why do n't you kill the Boy out-right ? You had better hurl him over-board at once , and put him out of his Misery . Upon that the Prisoner left off beating the Boy , and made him put his Cloaths on again . Court . Did you observe any Marks on the Boy 's Back ? Sugg . Yes , it was all black and blue , and wheal 'd , and his Eye was cut some how in whipping ; and when the Prisoner saw that , he threw the Cat-o'-nine-Tails over-board , and said , I am sorry I have beat you so much , but I 'll never beat you any more . Then we went to Sheerness , where we staid 2 Days . The Prisoner and I drank together , and he and the Boy were good Friends . But going out to work next Morning he beat the Boy again , because the Boy had eat more Victuals than he intended to let him . Sirrah ! says he , if you offer to eat a bit of Bread without asking my leave , I 'll strip your Skin over your Shoulders . Two Days after this , when we were at work , he beat the Boy with a Helm-stick ( the Titler , that we steer the Boat with ) because he had eat some Victuals without asking leave . And when he had done beating him , he stript him to see if he was black and blue , and I saw the Blood was ready to start out of his Skin . Then we return 'd to Sheerness , and were all good Friends again ; but after this he beat the Boy again , because he was lousy , and he took some of the Lice , and thrust them into the Boy 's Mouth , and swore , damn his Soul he 'd make him eat them . The Boy told me , that he could not keep himself clean , for he had been 3 Months with his Master , and had had but 1 Shirt to his Back in all that time . After this the Prisoner and I quarrel 'd and fought together . Court . What did you quarrel about ? Sugg . I told him I would not work any more with him if he abused the Boy so . Court . Had you no other Motive ? Sugg . Yes ; he did not do by me as he should do about the Fish , for he went to Billingsgate and sold seven hundred , which I was to have had my share of , but he spent all the Money except Six-pence , and so we parted . But before this parting , I had taken up a Fisherman 's Lave-Net , and put it into the Prisoner 's Boat ; and three Days after parting I met the owner of the Lave-Net , and told him of it , so we went together on board the Prisoner 's Boat to fetch it ; we asked the Boy where it was , and he said he knew nothing of it ( for the Prisoner being there , I suppose the Boy was afraid to say it was there , without leave ) but the prisoner bid him see for it , and then he went and fetch 'd it . I believe his Master had just been beating him afresh , for he was in a sad condition ; his right Eye was cut down half an inch ( it was his left Eye that was cut before ) and his Cheek was cut a matter of two Inches down ; the Blood was running fresh from those Wounds , and it run from his Head like a Spout . Court . When was this ? Sugg . I forget the Day of the Month , but it was on a Tuesday , about six Weeks or two Months ago . And four-Days after this , the Prisoner brought the News to Billingsgate , that his Boy was dead . He said that he fell from the Mast-Head , and killed himself ; but that was impossible , for his Mast is so low , that a Man may stand upon his Boat 's Head and reach the top of it . Will . Finch . I saw the Prisoner beat the Boy barbarously with a Tiller , at Sheerness Dock ; George Sugg ( the last Witness ) was then in the same Boat ; I ridicu 'd the Prisoner for so doing ; You Villain ! You Rascal you ! says I , your Master never served you so ! About a Week or a Fortnight after ( I am not certain to the time , but it was upon a Friday-night ) the Prisoner brought the Boy dead in his Boat to Hammersmith , and there he run her a-ground , and left the Boy in her all Night . Court . Did you see that ? Finch . No ; but the Boat was found there next Morning , and the Prisoner was gone to Billingsgate . Court . But how do you know that the Prisoner brought the Boat in over Night ? Finch . Next Morning his Father came to my House crying ; I asked him what was the Matter ? He said Matter enough , his Son had brought his Boy home dead . I said it was no more than I expected . Court . What his Father told you is no Evidence . Finch . But I met the Prisoner himself not long after , and he said , What Cheer Finch ? Pretty Cheer indeed , says I , you have made a fine piece of Work of it ! your Boy is dead it seems , but it 's what I expected . Why , says he , I own I have beat the Boy , but that was not the Cause of his Death . Court . Did you see the Boy in the Boat ? Finch . Yes ; and I saw he had several Wounds and Bruises . Court . Were they such as you think might occasion his Death ? Finch . I have no Judgment in such Cases . Court . The last Witness swore that the Prisoner sold some Fish , and then spent all the Money but Six-pence . Had you any concern in that Fish ? Finch . No . William Webster . About two Weeks before the Boy 's Death , I was at Sheerness , and having some Fish to sell , I borrowed a Basket of the Boy ( in the Prisoner 's Absence ) and in about half an Hour the Boy came to me crying , and said , Give me the Basket , my Master is going away . I asked him why he cry 'd ? He said his Master had knocked him down backwards two or three times with his Fist for lending me the Basket . I saw the Boy when the Coroner sat , his Body was blackish , and had several Wounds . Court . Might not those Wounds be caused by a Fall from the Mast ? Webster . No , there could never be so many of them . Court . Do you think those Wounds were the Cause of his Death ? Webster . I am no judge as to that . Robert Davis . I am a Waterman at Hammersmith . On the 2d of December between One and Two in the Morning , the Prisoner 's Father called and said , he had got a job for me that Tide ; so I went down to the Water-side , and there I found the Prisoner putting the Fish out of his Boat into mine . He said he wanted me to carry that Fish to Billingsgate . Says I , How came you to bring this Fish by Billingsgate last Night , and now want me to carry it back thither ? Why , says he , something has happened . So he laid down in the Boat sleep , and ordered me to land him at Card Alley ( by the Old Swan . ) When we came there , he fetch 'd a Basket and sorted the Fish , and bade me go to Billingsgate and sell them . I asked who was his Market-Man , and he said , Blackbourn . The Prisoner went Home to Hammersmith that Night on foot , and I believe got there before me . Henry Banks . The Prisoner 's Wife and Sister came to me , and said , Can you make a Coffin ? Yes , says I , have you brought the Measure ? No , says his Sister , but if it is as high as my Shoulder it will do ; and it must be done by six at Night . Before I had carried the Coffin Home , the Prisoner came and desired me to lend him a Hand to bring the Body from the Boat . I asked him if he had a Justice 's Warrant for moving the Body ; and he said , Yes . So he took a Lanthorn ( for it was between 8 and 9 at Night ) and I and another went with him to the Blue Anchor at the Water-side ; when we came we found the Boat lay off from the Shore ; so we took another Boat , and Robin Davis push 'd us off . When we came to the Prisoner 's Boat , I could not see the Body , and ask 'd him where it lay ? He said , in the Head of the Boat . So I put my Hand under the Head of the Boat , and felt the naked Body ; it was crouded up so close there , that I thought it impossible to thrust a dead Body into so little room ; and therefore it was my Opinion , that the Boy had crept in there for fear of being beat , and so had died in the Place . I was above an Hour in getting the Body out ; but at last , I got it thro ' a Hole 14 Inches square ; it had no Clothes on , only it was wrapp 'd up in a Red-rug . So says I to the Prisoner , Where 's the Boy 's Clothes ? Why , says he , the Clothes are all bloody , for he fell from the Mast and kill 'd himself . Then we went a-shore , and I put the Body a-thurt [ athwart ] the young Man 's Shoulders , the Prisoner went before with the Lanthorn , I staid a little to launch the Boat off , and then follow 'd . When the Prisoner came to the Lane 's end , he was taken from us by the Constable . I help 'd the young Man to carry the Body to the Prisoner 's house , and there I laid it a-thurt a Bed , and then the Prisoner 's Wife desir 'd me to fetch the Coffin . I went , and when I return 'd , the Body was made clean , and lay on a Table with the Back upwards . Court . Did you observe any Marks on the Body ? Banks . I saw none , but one upon the Arm , and a red Circle round one Eye . Court . The first Witness gave an account of the Boy being severely whipt sometime before his Death ; did you see any Marks on his Back ? Banks . No , his Back was clean , I saw no Marks ; I turned him and helped to put him in the Coffin . Court . Did you examine his Head ? Banks . No . Court . Do you think those Bruises you saw could be the Cause of his Death ? Banks . I think not . Court . Was you acquainted with the Prisoner ? Banks . Yes , I knew him when he sucked his Mother . Court . What Character has he ? Banks . I never heard but he always behaved well before this . John Dafforn . On Thursday ( the Day before the Boy died ) I went unto Sheerness , and there I saw the Prisoner and his Boy ; it was then a very hard Frost . The Boy had nothing on but a Serge Waistcoat and Breeches , and he said he had been at Work all Night and all Day in the Cold , and had had no Victuals . He was wet to the Skin , and I seeing a dry Jacket in the Boat , said to him , Sirrah , why do n't you put on that Jacket ? I did put it on , says the Boy ; but my Master made me pull it off again , and beat me , and broke my Head here about my Temples . Says I to the Prisoner , How can you use the poor Boy so , he is ready to perish with Wet and Cold , he 'll never live to see London again ? Then the Prisoner went a shore for a Pint of Gin ( whether he intended any of it for the Boy or not I can not tell ) but when he was gone the Boy shew 'd me his Head . There was a Wound in the Temples , and the Flesh was bruised and black all about it ; and I afterwards understood that the Boy did not live above 5 Hours after . Court . Do you think those Wounds were the Cause of his Death ? Dafforn . I believe those Wounds and want of looking after , and Hunger and Cold together , were the Cause of his Death , and especially Hunger and Cold ; for we must all dye if we have nothing to eat or keep us warm . Prisoner . I cut some Wood to make him a Fire , and hung his Shirt up to dry . Benedict Duddle , Surgeon . Pursuant to the Coroner 's Orders , on the 5th of December , I examined the Boy 's Head , and found 3 contus 'd Wounds , 2 of them were very considerable : I made a cross Incision , and raised the temporal Part , and found a large Quantity of coagulated Blood in the Interstices of the Fibres of the Muscles . I saw 'd the Skull round in the ordinary way , but found no Contusion or Fracture in the Skull . Court . Could that extravasated Blood be the Cause of his Death ? Mr. Duddle . The Dura Mater was found , but the Pia Mater much inflamed , and the Vessels much extended ; the Vessels of the Brain were very turgid ; the whole Substance of the Brain was much swell 'd . Now the violent Concussion proceeding from the Blow , might so disturb and affect the Brain , as to occasion these Appearances , and so be the Cause of his Death . Court . Have you known any Instances of a Person 's Death being caused by such an external Violence when there was no Fracture in the Skull ? Mr. Duddle . Yes , there was one Biggs , who was killed at Kensington Gravel-Pis , on the 23d of May was a twelve Month , by being pushed against a Cart-wheel . There was only a single Wound , no Contusion or Fracture , and yet between the Pia Mater and Dura Mater we found five Ounces of extravasated Blood . And in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris , there is another Instance of a Criminal , who was to have been broke upon the Wheel , but ( his Hands being chained behind him ) he run his Head against a Wall , and died immediately : The Surgeon who opened his Head found no Contusion . I examined the Body of the deceased , I found nothing in the Thorax or Abdomen that could occasion his Death ; I observed a Contusion in his Arm , upon which I raised the Skin , and found the Muscles discoloured , but nothing that could cause his Death , he had no other Wound but that in his Head . John Delauny , Surgeon . I examined the Body with Mr. Duddle , and am of the same Opinion with him . There were 3 Contusions between the temporal and coronal Satur . We opened the Head and found an Inflammation of both the upper and lower Brain , though I ca n't tell if the Brain was swell 'd so much as to be the Cause of his Death . Court . Did you observe any Marks on his Back ? Delauny . I look 'd on his Back , but saw no Marks , it was all clean and plain . The Prisoner 's Defence . Tho Porter . The Prisoner served his Time with me , and behaved himself well . Court . What was his Temper , was he good natur 'd ? Porter . Yes ; 't is possible the Boy might be killed if he fell from the top of his Mast , for it is 15 foot high . Court . Here was one Witness said he could reach the top of it with his Hand . Porter . He tells Lyes then . Court . Is it usual for the Boys to go to the top of such Masts ? Porter . Yes , to Reeve the Blocks ; 't is very common . John Smith . I have lived 4 years in the same House with the Prisoner , he is a good tempered Man , and never used his Wife with ill Manners , nor any of his Neighbours . John Woodmore . I have known him from a Child , and never knew him to hurt any Body , he was always good natur 'd to me , and so he was in general ; I have seen Fellows abuse him , and he has never said any thing again . Henry Savery . On Friday the 2d of December , about 10 or 11 in the Morning , I met the Prisoner in his Boat by Greenwich , and says I , John , where 's your Boy ? why , says he , I am come to a sad Misfortune , I sent him up the Mast at Old-Haven in Essex , and he fell off and killed himself , and I carried him a-shore to get a Bed , but the People would not let me have one to put him in . The Prisoner was going up to London , and I was going outwards , and so we past and said no more : He was a civil Neighbour . The Jury found him guilty of Manslaughter only . * 4. Barbara Hewsley , alias Cornelius , was indicted for privately stealing a Gold-Watch and Chain , value 10l . and two Cornelian Seals , value 40 s. from the Person of Edward Gouge , Dec. 24 . * She was tried last Sessions with Mary Jones , for robbing Arthur Murphy on the Highway , vide Sessions Paper , Numb . 1. p. 5 . Edward Gouge . I dined in Bloomsbury-Square , and staid there till between 2 and 3 in the Morning , and then going home I met the Prisoner in Drury-Lane ; she challenged me by Name , and said I knew her and her Mother ; this being just by a Brandy Shop , says I , let 's go in , that I may see who you are . I sat down there , and pulled out my Watch , to see what o'Clock it was , and when I had staid some time I went away ; I had not been gone above three Minutes before I mist my Watch , upon which I went back to the Shop , but she was gone . I asked the Man of the House if he knew her , he said yes ; I bid him look for her , and if he could get my Watch again I would give him a Guinea . Prisoner . When the Linkmen came into Mr. Puddington 's Brandy Shop and attacked you , did not you take out your Watch , and did not I bid you take Care of it , and did not you then put it into my Hand ? Gouge . Not that I know of . Prisoner . You did , as God is my Judge ; but you was so drunk that you was hardly sensible , you called for 6 half Pints of Gin , and paid Puddington 2 s. for it . Gouge . I was in Liquor I own . Court . It may be necessary to ask you to what Degree , are you sure you was so far sensible as to be now capable of giving an Account of what you did then ? Gouge . I remember my sitting by Paddington , and giving him Liquor , and that when I went out I consider 'd what Company I had been in , and thereupon felt for my Watch , and mist it . Edward Toft , Headborough of St. Giles 's . I went to the Round-house between 3 and 4 o ' Sunday Morning , the 24th of December . The Prisoner was there , and I heard she had been stripp 'd naked , to search for a Gold-Watch that had been stolen from a Gentleman ; but to no Purpose . Puddington being there too , he said he had some Reason to suspect she had put it in a private Place , and upon hearing that , she presently shew 'd me the Place he spoke of , and bid us search and welcome . He and I refused , but Jonathan Haselden ( the Governor of the Round-house ) undertook it , and after a little Examination , he produced the Watch . Prisoner . I put it there to preserve it for the Gentleman , for fear my Husband should find it , and take it from me ; for I did not think Puddington a proper Man to trust it with . John Puddington . The Prosecutor and Prisoner came into my Shop between 2 and 3 in the Morning , they staid there about 2 hours , and then he went out and she after him ; he returned in 4 or 5 Minutes , and asked for her . I told him she was gone , but I knew where she liv 'd , and would endeavour to find her out ; I found her in her Room up two pair of Stairs , and had her before Justice Mercer ; she deny 'd that she had any Watch . The Justice sent for the Governor of the Round-House , whose Son came , and we conducted her to the Round-House , where she stripp 'd herself to be search 'd , but we found nothing upon her , and so she put on her Clothes again . I went out , but before I had gone far , I recollected that as we went along with her from the Justice 's to the Round-House , I had seen her stooping forward , and poking with her Right-hand in her Pocket thus - and with her Left-hand a good deal lower thus - so I went back , and said , Bab , you have certainly got this Watch about you . Where have I got it ? Says she . I told her in what Place . Why then , says she , as you are a married Man , you may search ; and with that as she sat in the Chair , she parted her Feet , and remov 'd the Covering , I refus 'd to search , and so did Mr. Cross ; but we told the Governor it was his Business , and at last he agreed to do it . When she found we were come to a Resolution , she made some Resistance ; but I and Mr. Cross kept her Feet in a proper Situation , while the Governor examin 'd the Premises ; after some search he call 'd out , and told us , that he had got hold of the Chain at last ; but says he , I had much ado to reach it , and with that he drew the Watch out , and in a sad Condition it was ; we cleansed it , and carried it to the Gentleman , who own 'd it to be his ; and then it was carry 'd before the Justice , by whom it was seal 'd up , and now we have it here . Prisoner . Was I deny 'd to you when you came to my Lodging to enquire for me ? Puddington . No ; but you deny 'd having the Watch . Prisoner . He and Cross fought about the Guinea they were to have for taking me up . This Fellow , my Lord , goes by the Name of Lawyer Puddington , the Law-splitter . He would swear this Candlestick was a Ha'penny Roll if he could get a Farthing by it . The Jury found her guilty to the value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5.

The Prisoner is an Italian , he came over with me , I had given him his Passage . Upon search I found 2 Dollars in the Place where he lay , which made me suspect him .

Joseph Brooks . By the Captain 's Order , I search 'd the Ship for the Money that was missing , and found two Dollars on the Sails where the Prisoner used to lie , which made us suspect him . We found him at the Tuscana Galley , where he gave us 869 or 870 Dollars , and swore by G - , dare was all . We computed the Complement , and found there was 126 wanting . Then he said , he had sold Sisteen for 3 Guineas ; he went with us to the Place , and we found them accordingly I told him , that was not all , upon which he called me aside , and said , By my ait I had forgot dare is 110 in a Bottle of de Vine , in de Closet , at the Tuscana .

Thomas Kemp . I live in Penitent-street in Ratcliffe Highway . The Prisoners lived almost opposite to me . About 6 on Friday Night , I made my Doors fast , and went to an Alehouse over the way to Supper ; for I am a single Man . About 9 I was told that my House was broke , I went home and found both my back Door and fore Door open , and that I had been robb 'd . I was a new Comer , my House was not quite fitted up , nor made so secure as it might be ; my back Door was fastened with a wooden Pin that went into a Hole in the Wainscot ; my fore Door had a Lock , but between the Lock and the Staple there was a hollow place through which the Lock might be push 'd back . Behind my House was a Yard , with a dead Wall 8 Foot high . The hole in the Wainscot where the Pin of the back Door went in was burst , so that I suppose the Entry was made that way . Court . What Goods did you lose ? Kemp . A Clock , 4 Sheets , 3 Blankets , 3 Shirts , 10 Napkins , a box Iron , a Sauce-pan , and other Things . Court . Did you recover them ? Kemp . Yes . Rebecca Ford informed me that she saw Thomas Banks in my House that Night , and he was taken up the Sunday following , and committed to Newgate . From thence he sent a Man with a Letter to Jane Gillam , desiring her to let no Body see the Goods he had left at her House but his Doughtear . Gillam sent this Letter to his Daughter , and she desiring the Bearer to read it to her , he was over-heard , and so I came to know where the Goods were lodged ; upon which I got a Warrant and found them at Gillam's 's . Jacob Farmer . Last Sunday in the Afternoon the Prisoner Thomas Banks desired me to carry this Letter to Mrs. Gillam 's . Court . Do you know who wrote it ? Farmer . Yes ; I saw him write it . T. Banks . I own I wrote the Letter . Court . Let it be read . Clerk reads . For Mrs. Gillam in Swan-Alley , in the Minories - Mrs. Gillam , I was sadly betrayed by the Woman which came to me at your House ; I am sincerely obliged to you for your good-will , and beg you to put every thing I left at your House out of any Body 's sight but my Daughter 's , who will come with the Bearer to you , and desire you to let him have the Petticoat I left at your House . This is all I can ask of you at present . I am your real Friend , when in my Power . Thomas Bankes - I do not think that they can hurt me if you are but my Friend . T. Banks . I acknowledge I left the Goods at Mrs. Gillam 's . You [ to the Prosecutor ] you fastened the Doors at 6 a-Clock , and went out ; did not you leave the Joiner at work in the House ? Kemp . No ; the Joiner was putting up his Tools without the Door when I went . Rebecca Ford . I was standing at my own Door ( which is over-against Mr. Kemp 's ) with a Candle in my hand , about 8 a-Clock o ' Friday Night ; I saw Elizabeth Banks at Mr. Kemp 's Door , and she being a Person of no Credit , I was willing to observe what she was about . By and by Thomas Banks ( her Husband ) came out of the House with a Bundle , and threw it out at the Door , and then taking it up he went away with it . It was as much as he c ould well carry . I thought he was going with it to his own House , but he went beyond . I follow 'd him a little way , but he went too fast for me , and his Wife went home . Court . How far is your Door from the Prosecutor 's ? Ford . Just cross the way , 7 or 8 Yards . Court . Could you know the Prisoners at that distance by the Light of your Candle ? Ford . I knew them easily , for they lived but hard by ; so I went and raised the Neighbours , and told them Banks had got a good Booty . T. Banks . You said before Justice Philips , that when I brought the Things to the Door I fell down , and the Bundle burst open , and that then my Wife came to hold a Candle . Ford . I said then as I say now . T. Banks . How long did you stand at your own Door ? Ford . I ca n't tell exactly . T. B . You said before that it was but 3 or 4 Minutes . Court . When was the other Prisoner taken ? Kemp . The same Night at her own Door . Martha Negus . The Night after the Robbery I was a charing at a House next to Jane Gillam 's in Swan-Alley ; she call 'd me out , and said , a Gentleman wanted me to go of an Errand ; I went to her House , and there I found Thomas Banks dressing himself in a strange Disguise . He had tied a piece of a white Shoes about him like an Apron , and put a Woman 's Apron over his Shoulders ; he slopt his Hat over his Nose , and over that he wrapt another piece of Linnen , one end of which he brought down to his Mouth . I could not guess the meaning of all this , but he told me he was in great Poverty , and afraid of being arrested , and that he wanted me to go and carry a Gown to his Daughter , that she might come out to speak with him , for she had never a Gown to put on . He took me thro ' Rag-Fair , where he bought an old pair of Shoes , and coming into Penitent-street , he pointed to a Door , and said , There my Daughter lives , carry this Gown and these Shoes , and bid her put them on , and come to me at the Corner of the Street , where I will wait for her . It was then about 10 at Night . I deliver 'd my Message to her , and while she was striking a Light , he follow 'd ; Father ! says she , my Mother 's gone to Newgate ! for God 's sake make your Escape ! get away Backwards , for the House is beset by Kemp and several more . Upon hearing that he ran down Stairs , and got away ; but Mr. Kemp coming in seiz 'd me with the Gown and Shoes , and carried me to the Justice 's House ; but the Justice not being at home , his Clerk order 'd me to be confin 'd . I begg 'd it might be in my own Room then , because as I got my living by charing in several creditable Families , if it should be known that I was committed to Prison on any such Account , it would be the Ruin of me . Mr. Kemp consented , and went and set with me himself , in my own Room . About 12 that Night , some Body knock 'd at my Door , Who 's there ? says I . A Man answer 'd Thomas Banks . Now , says I , to Mr. Kemp , you may go down and take him ; so I went down to Banks , and he ask 'd me , if I had deliver 'd the Goods as he order 'd me ? I told him , Yes ; for being a naked Woman , I was afraid of some Mischief if I said otherwise , while he and I were alone in the Street . So then we went into a Brandy-Shop that was just by , and presently Mr. Kemp came in , and the Prisoner was taken . Jane Gillam . About 12 a-Clock o ' Friday Night , Thomas Banks knock 'd at my Window ; I was a-bed , and told him , I could not get up . He begg 'd me to go to his Wife , who was in the Watch-house ; to get rid of him , I told him , I would ; but I did not go . About 4 a-Clock o ' Saturday Afternoon , I went out , and while I was gone , it seems , he brought the Goods to my House , for when I came home , says my Landlady , There 's Mr. Banks in your Room , he has brought a Bundle of Goods , and seems to be in Trouble . He lay down , and slept till 9 a-Clock , and then I waked him ; says he , I wish you 'd carry this Gown to my Daughter , for she 's stark naked . You 're a devilish Dog , says I , to pawn all your Daughter 's Things ; I ca n't go , but I 'll call Martha Negus , she 's at next Door . So I called her , and they went together ; it was not long before he came back , and told me he was foolish in going , for the Officers had like to have got him . As he was in Debt , I thought he meant the Bailiffs . I asked him where the Woman ( Martha Negus ) was ? He said he believed she was got drunk , and he desired me to let him stay in my Room . I told him it was late , and I was a lone Woman , and therefore it would not be proper ; he said his Heart was too full to have any Nonsense that way . So he lay down , and by and by a Neighbour called and said , that Black-Gown ( Martha Negus ) was taken up . I waked him , and he said he 'd go and clear the Woman , and accordingly he went in the very Mouth of'em . Samuel Alexander . I live next Door to Martha Negus ; about 12 a-Clock o'Saturday Night , Thomas Banks knock 'd at her Door ; says my Wife , What do you want ? For God 's sake , says he ; call her down , for I am in much Trouble . I thought he was in fear of an Arrest , and so says I , you had better go into that Brandy-Shop , ( which is but 3 or 4 Yards off ) for you may be seen if you stand there . He told me , that he had already escaped over a Wall ; he went into the Shop , and presently Kemp came and called me to assist in taking him , which I did just as he was coming out of the Brandy-Shop . Court . Was he in the Brandy-Shop before Negus came down ? for the says , she went in with him . Alex Yes he was , but he was in and out 2 or 3 times before she came down , so that she might go in with him . Negus . I went down and laid the first Hand on him after he went into the Shop ; I told him he was a persidious Fellow to bring me into all that Trouble ; but since I was a Prisoner he should be one too . T. Banks . There was no Lock , nor Bolt , nor Pin , to the back Door , and it stands open Day and Night : And you say there was no Body in the House after you went out , was not one Mr. Daws there ? Kemp . Yes , but not till after I was told the House was broke open , and then several went in . Banks . There were four Men , and Daws was one of them , he ow 'd me a Spight , and left the Bundle at my Door , as I shall prove . Rebecca Ford swore that the Bundle was wrapt up in a Sheet [ or a Blanket ] and thrown out at the Door on the Ground . The Street was very dirty then , but that Blanket that was found at Mrs. Gillam 's on Monday , was not dirty . Kemp . I lost three Blanket 's and found but one of 'em again . Mary Banks , ( the Prisoner 's Daughter . ) About 5 a Clock o ' Saturday Morning , Edward Daws and Mr. Kemp brought these Things in a Bundle , and laid them under our Window ; but seeing me look out at the Window , they turned their Backs and went away . Court . Are these the same Things in Court ? M. B . Yes . Court . How do you know , did you see them opened ? M. B . No , but it was such a Bundle . Court . What became of the Bundle ? M. B . They carried it away again in a Minute . Court . But are you sure that it was Daws and the Prosecuter who laid this Bundle under the Window ? M. B . Yes . Court . Was not there a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood about Kemp 's House being broke open before this Bundle was brought ? M. B . Yes , on the Thursday Night , but my Father was then sitting at home by the Fireside . Court . This will not account for his carrying those Things to Gillam 's . T. Banks . Daws can not deny the bringing those Goods to my Window . Edward Daws . I never saw any of those Goods . Court . Did you and Kemp on Saturday Morning , or at any other Time after the Fact , leave any Goods whatever under the Prisoner 's Window ? Daws . No . T. Banks . Was not you in Kemp 's House the Night the Fact was committed ? Daws . I was a Bed then , and got up upon Rebecca Ford 's Outcry , that Kemp 's House was broke , and then I went in and found the Door open . T. Banks . Kemp told the Justice that his back Door was not forced open . Kemp . No , I said no such Thing : I said I found them both open , but did not know how they came open . T. Banks , to his Daughter . ] Mary ! Did you see any Body go into , or come out of Kemp 's House , before Rebecca Ford gave the Alarm ? M. B. I saw Kemp go out and leave the Door open , and after that the Workmen came out . Court . Was that before Mrs. Ford called out ? M. B . Yes . Kemp . The Workmen was without the Door when I went away . Court to M. B . Did the Workman come only from the House , or out of it ? M. B . He came out of it ; for Kemp did not lock the Door . Kemp . I did lock it . The Jury found Thomas Banks guilty of the Indictment , Death ; but it appearing that Eliz . Banks was his Wife , and acted under his Direction , she was acquitted . 31. Samuel Thomas , of St. Giles 's without Cripplegate , was indicted for the Murder of Elizabeth his Wife , by throwing her on the Ground , and striking and kicking her on the Head and Membrane of the Brain , and thereby giving her several mortal Bruises , of which she instantly died , on the 4th of January . He was a 2d time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Eleanor Bird . I live in Bell-Alley in Golden-Lane . Last Wednesday Night was seven-night I went to Bed about ten and fell asleep ; I was waked between 12 and 1 , by a great Noise in the Entry below . When the Prisoner was quarreling with his Wife , he swore , Damn his Eyes and Liver , get up Bess ! but she was so fuddled that she could not Court . How do you know she was fuddled ? Did you see her ? Bird . No , but she would have got up her self if she had not been drunk , so he brought her up Stairs , and lifting up the Latch he put her into my Room , and there he beat her and paid her with his Feet and Hands as he had done below ; and then I heard something gush : I was afraid it was Blood , and so I struck a Light , and she was all in a Goar , in the grievousest Manner that ever you saw any Creature ; but I ca n't tell where the Blood descended from . He struck her no more after the Light came , but turned her Face up and stamp 'd about , and fell on his Knees , and said , my dear Betty , I fear I have killed you , but if I have I will never leave you , but will freely be hanged for you . I observed that her Shins were sadly bruised , and so was her Face , and full of Scratches too ; she died in the Afternoon of the same Day . Prisoner . Did not you say that her Shift was bloody ? Bird . No ; I did not see any Shift that she had . Ann Rush . Bird and I lay in the same Room , I went to Bed about 10 , and was waked between 12 and 1 , by a great Noise ; the Prisoner was beating his Wife sadly in the Entry . I heard both their Voices , I heard him say , get up Stairs , you Bitch ! I heard several blows and Stamps , and I heard her say , I am going as fast as I can ; then he dragged her up Stairs and opened our Door . Court . How do you know he dragg 'd her up , if you did not see him ? Rush . I could hear that , and besides she was not able to come up her self . Court . Why do you think so ? Rush . Because he had beat her to that Degree , that she could not be able to go . Court . But might not her Inability proceed from her being in Liquor ? Rush . I do n't know whether she was in Liquor or no : When he had got her into our Room , I heard him stamp , and I believe by the Sound he stamp 'd upon her , but I will not be positive , because I had no Candle ; but when Eleanor Bird had struck a Light , I saw the deceased lying upon her Face , all in a goar of Blood , and in a very deplorable Condition . He turned her upon her Back , and said , my dear Wife , I fear I have killed you ! Court . What did she say ? Rush . She never spoke a Word after . They both lodged in the same House one pair of Stairs higher . Then he went to his Sister-in-Law , who wash 'd her Wounds , and put her to Bed , but she died about 4 in the Afternoon . I had lodged but a Month in the same House , but he had beat her several times in that Space . Court . Was she addicted to drinking ? Rush . I do n't know . E. Bird again . They and I lived in that House 3 Years , I do n't know that she was addicted to Drinking , except she might be fuddled at that time , and I suppose they had been drinking together . Deborah Hudson . The Deceased was my Sister . The ill Usage she has often received - Court . Do you know any Thing of the Fact he now stands indicted for ? Hudson . No more than that Word was brought me of her being kill 'd , for I lived afar off from where she did . Court . You are not to give an Account of what you heard from others , for that is no Evidence , nor is it proper for you to run into Particulars that have no Relation to this Fact . Susan Marriage . I live next door to the Prisoner , and lie in a Ground Room close to the Window . The Prisoner often fell out with his Wife , and that Night I heard him draw her along under my Window like a Beast . Court . How do you know it was either he or she ? S. M. I knew their Voices ; and I heard her say , Do n't strike me any more , for if you do you will kill me ! and he answer 'd , Ye Bitch , it 's my Design ! Court . Are you positive it was he who made that Answer ? S. M. I think it was ; I am partly sure it was . Prisoner . That Witness has told a great many Lies about it already . Bridget Decartney . I live next door too ; and between 11 and 12 at Night , as I lay a Bed , I heard an Argument in the Passage , betwixt the Prisoner and his Wife . She cry 'd , with a bitter Groan , Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! and he said , Ye Bitch , get up ! Court . Did he say only up , or up Stairs ? B. D. Not up Stairs , but only up , from where she fell . And says she , I am not able to get up , without you help me . Yes , ye Bitch , I 'll help ye up , says he . Dear Sam , says she , do n't strike me , for if ye do you 'll kill me . Ye Bitch , says he , 't is my Design to kill you ! Court . Are you sure that they spoke those Words ? B. D. Yes , I am sure by their Voices , for I have known 'em twenty five Years . Prison . That 's more years than you are old . B. D. May be so . Prisoner . I do n't know what you know of me , but I know nothing of you , but that you are a Drunkard , like my Wife . Sarah Lee . The Prisoner served his Wife much in the same manner a year and a half ago , and if it had not been for me she had dy 'd then . Court . What do you know of the Fact he is now charged with ? S. L. Last Thursday Morning was a-se'nnight I met his Landlady , who told me a sad Accident had happened , for Sam Thomas had killed Bess , and asked me if I would not go up and see her ; so I went up , and she lay in a plovable Condition ; all her Head was cut so that I could put my Finger in the Wounds ; I felt of her Belly , and it was cold , and she had bled three quarts of Blood . Says I , she 's a dying Woman ; Why do n't you take the Rogue up ? Then he came into the Room , and stoop 'd to kiss her , and says he , I know I have killed her , and you Bitches , G - d d - n you , wo n't stick to hang me for it , if you can ; but I know you ca n't , for I shall get off . And then taking up a Poker he went out swearing , G - d d - n us , he would make a Sacrifice of the first Bitch that offered to stop him . Con . What Business did the Prisoner follow ? S. L. He 's a Bunter ; I knew his Wife from a Child , she was about 26 or 27 Years old when she died , and a likely sober Body she was . Thomas Godman . The Overseers of the Parish and the Coroner sent for me to see the Deceased before she dy 'd . I found her in Convulsions , and in a manner expiring ; I told them she was a dead Woman , and it was in vain to do any Thing to save her , and she died about 4 in the Afternoon . I view 'd her afterwards , her Head and Body were full of Contusions all over ; I never saw any one in the like Condition . There was a large Cut in her Head , and her Head was 'swell 'd in Comparison as big as a Peck . I opened the Muscles that cover the Skull , and found a large Quantity of extravasated Blood lying on the Sutors , which were in a manner separated . I believe there might be a Pint , or a Pint and a half of Blood , for I took out several Handfuls . This extravasated Blood must have been caus 'd by external Blows , and having such an Effect upon the Sutors must have been the Cause of her Death , and therefore I had no Occasion to open the Skull , or examine any farther . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . My Wife was always drunk two or three Days in a Week ; and that same Night I found her with a Man that she kept Company with , and so I got her Home ; and I own I did beat her , because she was drunk , but in going up Stairs she and I both fell down . And then she was much addicted to pilfering , for she would often thieve wet Shirts and Smocks . Court . Have you any Body to give you a Character ? Prisoner . No . But I can say this of my self , that if there is an honest Man in the World I am one ; and I have a Witness that can give a Character of my Wife . Elizabeth Powell . The Deceased was given to pillfering : One Day she brought me a wet Smock , and would have had me to have dry 'd it and carry 'd it to pawn ; and because I would not , she throw 'd it away . Indeed she was fuddled then , and so she was often , for she was mightily given to drinking . Another . You lie , Hussey , she was a good honest working Woman , and would slave like a Pack-Horse when you would come Home with an empty Basket . The Jury found him guilty of both Indictments . Death . 32. John Alexander Mears , alias Cromwit , alias Emerton , was indicted for stealing a Deal Box , value 6 d. 3 Gold Rings , value 20 s. 2 Silver Spoons , value 12 s. a Silver Ladle , value 20 s. 9 Guineas , 11 s. 2 Pair of Silver Buckles , a Napkin , a Silk Hood , 2 Fans , a Pen-knife , a Case-knife , a Pair of Gloves , and a Pairs of Shoes , the Goods and Money of William Holder , in his House , December 16 . And 33. Michael Gore was indicted for receiving a Pair of Gloves and 2 Knives , Part of the said Goods , knowing them to be stolen . Margaret Holder . I keep a Publick Cellar in the Strand , facing Somerset-house . I had harboured the Prisoner Emerton about 3 Weeks in my Cellar . He was a poor shabby Fellow , tho ' now he has got a good Suit of Cloaths to his Back , but the Money that he stole from me paid for 'em . He used to do odd Chars , run of Errands , and water Horses . I gave him Victuals , and let him sit up by my Fire all Night . My Daughter lay up 3 Pair of Stairs , and she being taken ill , I went up to see her between : and 3 in the Afternoon , and left him and two little Girls ( Ann Delamore and Mary Hemming ) in the Cellar . I had not been gone long before one of the Girls came up and told me that John Emerton had taken my Box , and was run up Swan-yard with it . Court . What had you in the Box ? Holder . Nine Guineas , 11 Shillings , and 12 penny worth of Halfpence ; a Silver Punch-Ladle , 2 Silver Spoons , 3 Gold Rings , 2 Pair of Silver Buckles , a Pair of Shoes , 4 Pair of Gloves , a Silk Hood , 3 Knives , one of them was a Pen-knife , and several other Things that I ca n't remember . Court . Where did you leave the Box when you went up ? M. H. It stood on a Trunk in my Bed-room , on the same Floor with the Publick Room in the Cellar . The Door of my Room was left open , but the Box was lock 'd . Court . Did you find your Goods again ? M. H. I found the Box , and some of my Goods , at the Bull-Head in Wells 's Yard in Tottenham-Court Road , where he had taken a Lodging ; but all my Money , 2 of the Gold Rings , and other Things , were quite lost . This honest Man here apprehended him , and he was admitted to Newgate ; and as he was going thither , he sent a Messenger to the other Prisoner Gore , to desire Gore to bring him all the Money he could raise . The Messenger shewed me the Directions , and we got a Warrant and search 'd Gore 's Room , where we found a Pair of Gloves , and two Knives , that I had lost . Gore was frighted , and said if we would not hurt him he would tell us where the Box was . We promis 'd to be favourable if he would confess all he knew ; and so he directed us to Emerton 's Lodgings . Upon that we discharg 'd Gore , only the Justice bound him over to be an Evidence against Emerton . But after this Gore sent my Punch-Ladle to pawn ( which he told us before that he knew nothing of ) and so he was taken up again . I and my Husband are poer old Folks , we had taken a great deal of Pains to scrape a little Money together ; and that Rogue Emerton ( tho ' I had given him a good Dinner that Day ) robb 'd us of all , and left us but 3 pence ha'peny in the World . Alex Miller , Constable . I was sent for to the Pawnbroker 's House , where one Michael Tool was stop 'd for offering to pawn the Prosecutor 's Punch Ladle . Tool told us he had it from Gore , and went with us to an Alehouse in Drury-Lane , where we found Gore ; who after some shuffling own 'd that he sent Tool to pawn it . Gore . Emerton gave the Ladle to my Wife to pawn , but I never touch 'd it my self ; and if I own 'd it I was not in my right Senses . Tho . Hitchcock . On the 16th of December , about 3 in the Afternoon , as I was sweeping Swan-Yard ( which is near the Prosecutor 's Cellar ) when Emerton came running up with a Box , I ask 'd him where he was going in such a Hurry ( for I had some Knowledge of him , having seen him before ) he made me no Answer , but kept running ; when presently the Girl ( Ann Delamore ) came after him , calling out , John ! John ! do n't run away with my Grandmother 's Box ! I follow 'd him , but lost sight of him , and so I came back . Court . Ann Delamore ; stand up , Child . How old are you ? A. D. Almost twelve . Court . Suppose now you should take an Oath , and swear any thing that is not true , what do you think will become of you ? A. D. After I die I shall never be happy . Court . Let her be sworn . Now besure you say nothing but the Truth . A. D. Yes , my Lord . My Grandmother went up and left John Emerton and me , and this Girl ( Mary Hemmings ) in the Cellar . Then he went up into the Street , and came down again presently , and told her that her Mother wanted her ; so she went . Then he sent me for a Pint of Beer ; I draw 'd it , and set it by him , and then I went up ; and Molly Hemmings came to me , and said , Let 's go down and see what John 's a doing . So just as we were going down he came up the Stairs , with my Grandmother 's Box , and run by us . I follow 'd him , and cry 'd , John ! John ! do n't run away with my Grandmother 's Box . He said , I am coming again presently . Court . Where did that Box use to stand ? A. D. In my Grandmother 's Bed-Room , and the Door was open . Court . Do you know what was in the Box ? A. D. Not justly , for I did not look in it often ; but I know my Grandmother kept her Ladle there when it was not in use . When I went up I left no Soul below but John . Mary Hemmings . Emerton went up into the Street to see the Gully-hole open 'd , and when he came down again , he says to me , Molly Hemmings , your Mother wants you ; I went up , but not finding my Mother , I was going down again , but when I was got down 4 Stairs , he came and turned me up again , and said , my Mother was at young Mrs. Holder 's ; I went thither , but my Mother was not there , and so in going back I saw Nanny Delamore by the Gully-hole , she said , she was going to tell her Grandmother . that John had had a Pint of Beer . Lord Nanny ! says I , I wonder what this John is doing by himself , let 's go and see ; and just as we were turning down , he came up with the Box , and got by us . He walk 'd till he came to the Queen's-Head Door , but as soon as we call 'd out John , John , do n't run away with the Box ; he said , I am coming again , Child , and then he ran up Swan-Alley like any thing . C. Where did the Box use to stand ? M. H. In the inner Room just by the Door , and near the Chimly Corner ; He had it partly under his Coat ; but I saw the Lock . Nathaniel Lake . On the 19th of December , Mrs. Holder , told me , Emerton had robb 'd her , I wish you had told me so before , says I , for I had an Opportunity of taking him . However , I met with him in St. Giles 's , on the 26th of December , and carry 'd him to her House , tho ' he run from me by the Old Playhouse , but I catch 'd him again . As we were carrying him in a Coach to Newgate , he pray 'd me to go to Gore 's Lodging , ( in Colston's-Court in Drury Lane ) and desire Gore to send him some Money . I told Mrs. Holder of this , she got a Warrant , we search 'd Gore 's Room , and found a pair of Gloves and two Knives there , which she own 'd ; when Gore saw that , he said , Do n't hurt me , and I 'll tell you where the Box is ; and so he directed us to Emerton 's Lodgings where we found it . We asked Gore , if he knew where the silver Spoons and Ladle were ? and he said , he knew nothing of them . Gore . There were Things in the Box of greater values than the Ladle and Spoons , why should you ask after them only ? Lake . Mrs. Holder did ask for several other Things , but I did not . Jonathan Jones . I insisted Mr. Lake in taking Emerton , and as we were carrying him in a Coach to Newgate , he writ down Gore 's Name with Chalk upon my Hat , and desired me to tell Gore to bring all the Money he had to him directly . We got a Warrant , and found the Gloves and Knives at Gore 's , and he told us where the Box was : I remember in particular this broken Ring and this Snuff Box , which Mrs. Holder owns , were found in Emerton 's Room . John Noon . I am Servant to Mr. Stone the Pawnbroker , I had notice given me , stop such a silver Ladle as this , if any Body offer 'd to pawn it to me , and on Friday Evening , the 19th of December , this was brought by Michael Tool , of whom I had some Knowledge , the Handle was broke off ; says I , you have made strange work with this Ladle ? Ay , says he , a sad Accident happened when this was done , for a China Punch bowl was broke at the same time . So I jump 'd over the Counter , and seiz 'd him , What do you mean 'Saule me ? No , says I , but I 'll pepper you , if you do n't tell me how you came by that . He told me , he had it from Gore , who was at an Alehouse ( the Sign of the Theatre ) in Drury-Lane ; I went thither , and found Gore a playing at Cards ; but he play 'd the wrong Card then . Says Tool , that 's the Man I had the Ladle from , and Gore after some Shuffling , and pretending that his Wife save it to Tool , at last confess 'd that he himself delivered it to Tool . Richard Humphries , Headborough . Gore let us search his Room readily , and told us where the Box was , at Emerton 's Lodging in Wells-Court by St. Giles 's Pound ; there was a Shirt hanging in Gore 's Room , and says he , When Emerton sent you to me for Money , I suppose he meant I should pawn this Shirt . Gore . They took away a pair of my Shoes , I hope I may have them again ? Mrs. Holder . Yes , there was a pair of Shoes that are none of mine , and they are in the Box there . Court . Then as they are not yours , and he claims them , let him have them : Officer , give those Shoes to the Prisoner , and if there 's any thing else that belongs to him , let him have it . Gore . I thank your Lordship , I claim nothing else . Emerton . I had used Mrs. Holder 's Cellar 3 Weeks Night and Day , and I happening to meet with a young Man of my Acquaintance , John , says he , I ca n't come out for fear of being arrested ; but there 's a Box of mine in Mrs. Holder 's Room , which I want very much , and if you will be so kind as to bring it to me , I shall be much obliged to you . You may take it away without any more to do , for no Body will ask you any Questions about it . So I took the Box and carried it up . The Girls called after me , and I told 'em I was coming again presently . Court . And why did you not return according to your Promise , or at least acquaint the Prosecutor with it ? Emerton . My Friend kept me to drink with him longer than I expected , and besides I ow 'd her a little Money , about 3 s. which I could not pay her till I had Remittances out of the Country , which I afterwards received indeed ; but my Friend hearing of it , he desired me to lend him 15 s. upon the Ladle and the Rings , which I did , and then he told me he had some other odd Trifles in the Box , which I might make Use of if I had occasion , and so I took the Box to my Room ; but he not returning me the 15s . at the time he promised , and I wanting Money , I gave the things to Gore 's Wife to pawn , and she brought me 6 s. Court . Who was this Friend of yours ? Emerton . John James ; but I hear he is absconded since , as well as Michael Tool : On the 26th of December I intended to call and pay Mrs. Holder ; but happening to be drinking where Mrs. Lake was , he charged me with the Fact , every thing else is as the Witnesses have sworn . Gore . I never received any Goods from Emerton , but I hear that my Wife did , and that she sent Michael Tool to pawn the Ladle . William Nolton . I keep an Alehouse in Milford-lane , I have known the Prisoner Gore above a year ; he has followed the Sea , but he 's a Painter by Trade ; he painted my House and lodged there a quarter of a year last Summer : He has paid above 50 s. for me , and brought me the Receipt very honestly ; I have trusted him in my House and never heard but he was a civil honest Man . Richard Rigg . I have known him 3 Months , and used to see him every Night at the Theatre-Alehouse in Clare Passage , and never heard him swear three times , nor give an abrupt Answer to any Body . Court . And how did you spend your time there every Night ? Rigg . In drinking and playing at Cards . Court . Did Emerton belong to your Club too ? Rigg . No , but I have seen him there once or twice . The Jury acquitted Gore , and found Emerton guilty of the Indictment . Death . 34 , 35 , 36. John Ackers , John Welton , and William Booth of St. James 's Westminster , were indicted for assaulting Richard Harvey on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Penknife and 35s . his Goods and Money , and an Iron Key , the Property of John Shute , Esq ; December 12 . [ At the Request of the Prisoners , the Witnesses were examined apart . ] Richard Harvey . On the 12th of December , near 9 at Night , I was going with a Letter for my Master Col. Shute , to the Foreign Post , and under the dead Wall , at the End of Albemarle-street , I was seiz 'd by some Street Robbers , I know not how many , but there were more than two ; they sat me upon a Rail opposite to the dead Wall , and blinded me with their Hands , and then punching me in the Face with something , they took 1 l. 15 s. and an old clasp Penknife of mine , and a Clock Case-key of my Master 's from me , and then giving me a thump upon my Back , they bid me go about my Business . It was very dark and I do n't know who they were . Charles Mascall . On the 11th of November Booth and I stop't a Coach between 6 and 7 at Night , and robb 'd two Gentlemen of two Purses , a Guinea and Silver ; and on the 12th of December between 8 and 9 at Night we attacked the Prosecutor in Albemarle-street , Welton stopt him first , then I took hold of him , Ackers jobb 'd him in the Face with a Pistol 3 times , and then Booth came up , clapt a Pistol to his Throat , and blinded him with his Hand . R. Harvey . I felt something like Iron at my Throat , but did not see what it was . Mascall . Weston took 19s . 6d . from him , I took a Key , and Sam Goodman ( for there were 5 of us ) took a clasp Knife , I saw no more Money than 19 s. 6 d ; but we often cheat one another in those Cases , there might be 5 l. for ought I know . Ackers afterwards took the Knife from Goodman , and threw it over a House ; then we all went through St. Martin 's Court , where we bought 8 pennyworth of Meat at a Cook 's Shop , and so to an Alehouse in Drury-lane . I do n't know the Sign , but it is the corner of a Court that goes to Blackmore-street , and is next door to a Tin Shop . There we eat the Meat and spent 17 Pence half penny in Beer and Bread . Court . What Meat was it , and how was it drest ? Mascall . It was ready drest , but cold , I believe it was roasted ; it was a sort of a Breast of Mutton , there was 2 pieces , and one had a Marrow-bone to it . Booth . Does a Marrow-bone belong to a Breast of Mutton ? Mascall . I do n't say that both pieces were the Breast . From thence we went to a Pawnbroker 's in Bowl-yard , where Welton had pawn 'd his Goat for 4 s. and we redeemed it . Then we went to a House we constantly use , the King's-Arms , the Corner of Lawrence-Lane in St. Giles 's . 'T is a grand bandy House , where they harbour Thieves and Whores , and let 'em in at all Hours in the Night . There we had some Beer , and I being about to go home , asked them to let me have a Shilling ; they denied me at first , but afterwards Ackers and Booth came out and gave it me , and I went away and bought some Victuals with it for my Family , but the Prisoners lay there together . Court . How do you know ? Mascall . They commonly lie there , and I found 'em there at 9 o ' Clock the next Morning ; then they gave me one Shilling more for my Share , so that I got but 2 s. in all . Court . How came you to differ ? Mascall . I heard that Goodman was going to make himself an Evidence , and so I got the Start of him , and went voluntairly before Justice Hilder and made my Information . Goodman was taken with the rest , but he was afterwards admitted an Evidence too . The Robbery was on the 12th of December , and I made my Information on the 18th of December . Court . Where did you meet before you went out upon this Robbery ? Mascall . We met that Morning as usual about nine o ' Clock , at the King's-Arms , and there we staid till between 6 and 7 at Night , and that 's the Time we commonly go out to pick Pockets , and what Handkerchiefs we meet with we bring to the Woman at the King 's Arms ; then we get our Suppers , and afterwards turn out upon Street-Robberies . That Night we went round all the Streets till we came to Albemarle Street , and there we stood by the Garden to look-out , till we met with the Prosecutor . We had three Pistols among , us , Ackers , Booth , and Goodman had each of 'em one , but I had none that Night . I had been out with them but three Weeks ; the first Time was the 11th of November , when I committed that Robbery with Booth . I was a Carter before , and a Master , but I met with Losses . Booth . Kirk the Thief-catcher lent him those Pistols to produce here in Court . Mascall . Goodman pawn 'd his Coat to buy these Pistols , and I happening to see them lying over their Bed , they told George Sutton of it , ( he is now in the Bail Dock ) and he said I might as well turn-out with them , and so I had them to keep . Booth . He has said that he had these Pistols six Weeks , and now he says that he had not known us above three Weeks . Mascall . I say I had not robb 'd with you above three Weeks . Booth . How came you and I acquainted ? Mascall . I knew your Father 15 or 16 years , and my first Acquaintance with you was seven years ago ; you used to come and enquire after me . Booth . Sam Goodman 's Friends gave 7 s. to these Thief-catching Bailiffs , Kirk and Brock [ alias Brogden Poplet ] to make him an Evidence . Mascall is a Thief-catcher too , he belongs to their Club . He took Viner White , ( when I and Sutton were Evidences * ) and he had 9 l. odd for his part of the Reward . I set down a Candle by him at the King's-Arms , and it happened to burn his Wig , upon which he swore that Jobb should fetch him 140 l. He has ow 'd me a Spight ever since , and once he went to cut my Throat . * Against C. Patrick , W. Moods and V. White , in September last . Vide Sessions Paper , Numb . 7 . Part 1 . Page 185 . M. I and Sutton and Booth had been drinking at Puddington , and in coming over the Fields Booth cut my Arm . Samuel Goodman . On the 12th of December , between 8 and 9 at Night , the Prisoners and I and Charles Mascall were walking about the lower End of Albemarle-Street , there 's a dead Wall on one Side , and Rails on the other ; the Prosecutor coming along , Welton stop 'd him ; Ackers hit him a Knock or two in the Face with a Pistol ; Booth blinded his Eyes with his Hand , and hit him under the Throat with another Pistol ; Welton took his Money , and told us there was but 19 s. and 6 d. tho'it seems there was more ; Mascall took a little Key , and I took a clasp 'd Knife , and then we all ran away . We bought some cold Mutton at a Cook 's Shop ( I do n't know the Name of the Place ) it cost about 8 d. there were two or three odd Pieces of it ready dress 'd ; I believe it was roasted ; one was a Marrow-bone Piece . Court . And what was the other ? G. They were both Marrow-bone Pieces . Then we went to an Alehouse in Drury-Lane ( I do n't know the House ) and there we had 3 or 4 Pots of Ale , and broil 'd the Mutton and eat it . We spent about 18 d. we did not stay a great while there , but went to the King's-Arms the Corner of Lawrence-Lane , where we always used to lie , and there we all went to Bed . Court . Did you all lie there that Night ? G. Yes . Court . Are you sure of it ? G. Yes , I think so ; except Mascall ; I believe he went away , for he did not use to lie there because he has a Wife ; but Ackers , Welton and Booth lay together , I saw them a-bed . We were all together next day at the same House . Court . Was Mascall there ? G. I ca n't say , but he used to come every Morning . We divided the Money over Night ; I and Mascall had 2 s. a-piece , and there was 4 s. paid to fetch Welton 's Coat out of pawn . Court . What Arms had you ? G. Three Pistols . Court . Who did they belong to ? Samuel Goodman . To all of us alike . They made me fuddled , and I pawn 'd my Coat for 18 s. and with that we bought a Pair of Pistols ; I am not sure that these here are the same Pistols , but they were such . Court . If you bought 'em , how came you not to keep 'em ? G. They used to keep 'em and plant ' e m as they pleas 'd ; I had not gone out with them above six Weeks . Court . How long after the Fact was it before the Discovery was made ? G. I was taken up the Week before Christmas . Court . Was the Robbery in Albemarle-street the last you committed together ? G. No ; the Saturday before we were taken we robb 'd a Man of 6 d. half-penny in Lincolns-Inn Fields , about 8 at Night . Court . How came you acquainted with such Company ? G. I ca n't tell . Court . How old are you ? G. Nineteen . Court . Who pawn 'd your Coat ? G. Sutton . I had been drinking at a Gin-Shop all Night . Booth . He and Mascall may well be in one Story , when they lodge together . John Smith , Constable . When the Prisoners were taken , Mascall said they had robb 'd a Man in Albemarle-street ; he produc 'd this Key , which he told me they took from the Person . I shew 'd it to the Prosecutor , who said he had lost such a one , but could not swear to it , tho ' upon Trial it fitted and open 'd the Lock of his Master Col. Shute 's Clock-Case . Ackers . I never saw Mascall but twice in my Life . Welton . Mascall swore in his Information , that we robb 'd a Man in Lincoln's-Inn Fields , and that he heard the Man cry out , but afterwards he own 'd that he was not there . Court . If you desire it , you may have his Information read ; it may be of Service to you if it shall appear that he has varied from it , but if it agrees with what he swears now , it will be Evidence against you ; it can be no Evidence except you call for it , but your insisting to have it read will make it Evidence , for it will be a Witness of your own producing , therefore consider what you do . Welton . I desire it may be read . Then Mascall 's Information was read . It was taken before Vol . Hilder , Esq ; Dec. 18 . 1732 , and sets forth , that on Sunday the 10th of December , Mascall , Goodman , and the Prisoners robb 'd and abused a Man in Lincoln's-Inn Fields ; that on the 11th of November , Mascall and Booth , between 6 and 7 at Night , stopt a Coach on the Backside of Gray's-Inn , and robb 'd 2 Gentlewomen of 2 Purses , a Guinea and some Silver ; that on the 12th of December , between 8 and 9 at Night , Mascall , Goodman and the Prisoners robb 'd a Man in Albemarle-Street , of 19s . 6d . a Knife , and a Key ; and that on the 16th of December , about 8 at Night , they robb 'd a Man in Lincoln's-Inn Fields , of 3 d. Half-penny . Court . When did Mascall say , that he was not present at the Robbery in Lincoln's-Inn Fields ? Justice Hilder . He said he was not near them , but was looking out upon the Watch at a Distance ; but was within Sight , and that the Person was used ill , and cry 'd out . Welton . He said , he was on one side of the Field , and we on t'other , and that he first walk 'd along the dead Wall , where he met two Gentlemen , and seiz 'd one of them , but let him go again , and then he said , he turn 'd back , and went another way . Court . If he stood at a Distance to watch , he was equally guilty of the Robbery with those who took the Money from the Man . Welton . He made an Agreement with Kirk and Brock , Will . James , and the rest of the Thief-takers in Drury-Lane , to apprehend us , and they are to share the Reward among them : Kirk would have taken my Life a Week or two before this Affair , and he swore then he would hang me before a Fortnight was at an End . Court . Kirk has not appeared against you . Welton . He 's ashamed to appear now , he 's so well known , he was concern 'd in taking Charles Patrick , and Will . Meeds , and appeared against them to get the Reward . But I told him , he should have no more hundred and forty Pounds , and upon that he swore , that I threaten 'd to set his House on Fire , and he lent Mascall these Pistols on purpose to produce in Court against us . Elizabeth Welton . John Welton is my Son , he was always very dutiful and endearing to me . Court . How did he live ? E. Welton . I keep a Chandler 's Shop , and am Landress to several Knights and Baronets , and he used to assist me , and would work like a Horse in carrying out my Goods ; I have trusted him with Things of great Value , and I never knew that he wrong 'd me of a Farthing , I live in Great St. Ann's-Lane , in Westminster , and he has lodg 'd at my House for this Year and Half . Court . Did he constantly lie at home ? E. Welton . Yes , he never lay out of my House , except when his Uncle was taken Sick , which was within this 5 or 6 Weeks , and then he used to go , and see him , and sometimes stay 'd there all Night . Thomas Brown and William Abbot . We have known him from a Child , but we know little of him for these 4 or 5 Years past , tho ' never heard that he had a bad Character . Court . Have you any Witnesses Booth ? Booth . Witnesses on my side would signify nothing if I had a thousand , because I have been wild , and have been an Evidence ; but what is sworn against me now , is a false as God made the World ; Mascall told Sutton that he would hang us both . The Jury found them all guilty of the Indictment . Death . 37 , 38. Elizabeth Smith , and Elizabeth Ingram , were indicted for stealing a Gown and a Cloak , the Goods of Mary Jenkins , Dec. 23 .

Acquitted . 50. Joseph Fretwell , was indicted for stealing a Wig , value 7 s. and a Hat , value 3 s. the Goods of Joseph Chapman , Dec. 29 . Joseph Chapman . On the 29th of December , between 9 and 10 at Night , my Girl and little Boy being to go from Strutton's-Grounds to the Horse-Ferry , I sent my Apprentice to light them , when my Apprentice came back , and told me , that a Man had snatch 'd off my Child 's Hat and Wig , and that he ran after the Rogue , but could not overtake him . Soon after , I was told , that the Prisoner had offer 'd to sell such a Hat and Wig at an Orange-Barrow . John Allen , a Watchman , found the Prisoner that Night , and brought him to my House . He had my Boy 's Hat upon his Head , and his Wig in his Pocket ; he fell on his Knees , and begg 'd me to be favourable ; my Wife was under some Concern about him as he was a Neighbour 's Child , and desired me not to prosecute , and being but a trifling Master I let him go to Bed ; but three Hours afterwards , Allen came again , and says he , If you wo n't prosecute him , I will prosecute you , and so I was obliged to send him hither , which otherwise I should not have done ; for I never knew that he followed such Courses , and his Father who is a Pipe-maker and lives in the Neighbourhood bears a very honest Character . John Allen , Watchman . Between 10 and 11 at Night , Mrs Chapman told me that her Child was robb 'd of his Hat and Wig , and that her Husband was gone to look for 'em . A Girl came up and said she had heard that Mr. Fretwell 's , Son had got the Hat and Wig , and that some were gone after him to Charing-Cross ; then says Mrs. Chapman , I 'll see that he sha n't go without being prosecuted . Court . Did Mrs. Chapman say so ? Allen . Yes . Court . Her Husband swears she desired him not to prosecute . Allen . You shall hear how that was . I goes away , and meeting with my Brother Watchman , Thomas Bird , I told him there was a Street Robbery committed by Mr. Fretwell 's Son . Court . I suppose you heard of a Reward for taking Street-Robbers ? Allen . I had to , but what I did , was not for the Sake of the Reward I 'll assure you ; so Bird found the Prisoner and brought him to me , and I carried him to Mr. Chapman ; then Mrs. Chapman being frighted , desired her Husband to excuse him : Upon which Mr. Cross , ( who lodges in Mr. Chapman 's House ) says to me , since Mrs. Chapman is frighted and is not willing the Lad should be sent to Newgate , if you will let him go , I will give you a Bond of Honour to secure you . Court . A Bond of Honour ? Allen . Yes , I am sure he said a Bond of Honour : Then says I , you ought to secure the Prosecutor too . Well , Allen says he , let us keep it as quiet as we can and there will be no Danger . The Prisoner shall go to the Place where the Child was robb 'd , and deliver the Hat and Wig to him ; so we went , and after the Child had got his Hat and Wig again , I up with my Staff and gave the Prisoner a Knock on the Breast , and said , was not you a Villian to wrong such an innocent Child ? Court . What Right had you to assault him after he had been discharged by the Prosecutor , and while he behaved himself peaceably ? Allen . I did nothing in Derision of Justice , but only in Resentment . Court . If the Jury should discharge him , he may perhaps make you pay for your Resentment . Why did you afterwards threaten to prosecute Mr. Chapman if he would not prosecute the Prisoner ? A . You shall hear . After I came back I met the Prisoner about one a Clock , standing full in my Walk . Go about your Business , says I , why do you stand brazening here in the Face of Justice ? You know this Thing has blacken 'd you , and therefore you ought to keep use of Sight for a quarter of a Year , and then if you mind your Work , and behave your self as you should do , perhaps there may be no more Notice taken of it . Lord , says he , I am very told ! Well , says I , there 's a Half-penny to buy you a Dram , and let me see you no more in my Walks . So I went my Rounds , and coming to my Brother Watchman 's Stand , there I saw the Prisoner again . Now , are not you a graceless Villian , says I , to stand so outdaciously here to affront Justice , when I gave you a Charge to the contrary ? and with that I gave him another Knock with my Staff . Court . And for what Reason , because he stood in your Way ? Was it an Insult upon Justice to appear in your Presence without Leave ? Allen . Why , suppose any of my Inhabitants had been robb 'd , or any of the King 's Subjects had been murdered , as I am his Majesty 's Officer , the Blame would have been laid upon me , for not making Use of my Authority , in taking Care to prevent such Mischief : And therefore I took the Prisoner , and carried him again to Mr. Chapman ; and Sir , says I , This Villain has not stood in Defiance of your good Nature only , but in Defiance of Justice and Authority , and therefore if you do n't prosecute him , I 'll proceed against you in a Process of Justice . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that it was a windy Night , and that he found the Hat and Wig . The Jury acquitted him . 51. John Williamson of Aldgate , was indicted for stealing a silver Cup , value 5 s. 6 d. the Property of John Hoply , October 24th . John Hoply . Last December was a twelve Month , the Prisoner came to my House in Rosemary-Lane for a Lodging . He had no Shirt on , and said he had been cast away . I took him in , and he lodged there till October following . He pretended to belong to the India House , and that he had great Effects and Interest there , and could help me to a Place of 12 s. a Week : At last he said he had done my Business , for he had secured the Place , and if I would go with him I might have it directly . So we went to the Ship-Tavern against the India-House ; he went over to the India House , and coming back again told me it was all done , and only wanted signing . My Watch and Cane lay upon the Table ; he took them , and said he 'd take those with him because he should make the better Appearance , and so he went out again , but never returned . The Night before this I lost a silver Cup , and I have Witness to prove that he took it . Cornelius Glin . The Prisoner has many other Names besides Williamson . He said he was Boatswain of the Grantham which was cast away , and that he should stay at the Prosecutor 's House till she was sitted up , that he had 30 s. a Week , and was to receive 50 l. at Woolwich . He ordered me to make him as many Cloaths as came to 20 l. I was drinking with him over Night at the Prosecutor 's , when he took up a silver Cup and looked on it . I did not see him , lay it down again . The Cup was mist , the Landlady enquired for it ; says I to him , What can become of this Cup that you was looking on , do n't let us have it missing when here 's none but ourselves in the Room ? Damn the Bitch , said he , I have the Cup , I only took it to frighten her , I 'll give it her again , but I 'll get a Pint of Brandy out of her first . So he called for a hot Pot , and then went to Bed . In the Morning I asked the Landlady if she had found the Cup , she said . No . I went up to the Prisoner ( who was a-bed ) and asked him why he kept the Cup so long ? Damn the Bitch , says he , I 'll give it her as soon as I get up . He had given me 9 s. 9 d. in Earnest for the Cloaths he bespoke , and which I made for him ; but being a little dubious of him , I would not deliver the Cloaths without my Money , nor return the Earnest , because I was likely to have the Cloaths left upon my Hands . When he found that , Damn the Fellow , says he , I 'll have a Warrant for him to make him either deliver the Cloaths , or return the Earnest . Prisoner . Where was the Cup when I look 'd on it ? Glin . It lay by a silver Tankard in the Corner of a little Cupboard that was open ; you moved your Chair towards the Cupboard , and took the Cup in your Hand , and then turned your back to me , but you did not put it in its Place again ; I heard you promise in Newgate that you would return the Cup , and Watch and Cane , if they would not prosecute . Prisoner . The Prosecutor lent me the Watch and Cane to grace me , that I might get him Preferment at the India-House . Sarah Trantum . There was an Outcry in the Prosecutor 's House that Day as he and the Prisoner went out together , and I heard the Prosecutor 's Wife say , this Dog ( the Prisoner ) has carried my Husband to the Tavern , and borrow 'd his Watch and Cane . Says I , have you lost nothing else ? No , says she , only the Cup , and I believe Glin his got that . Sarah Kent . Glin took me with him to Newgate , that I might see if I knew the Prisoner , and as he took me along two or three back ways , he said , Have a good Heart , we shall be well paid for the John . Eleanor Johnson . Last Tuesday Night I heard the Prosecutor and his Wife say , they did not lay the Cup to the Prisoner 's Charge , but to Glin , or his Wife . John Trantum . Glin came home ( a Saturday was a Fortnight ) in a Hurry , and said , We have taken the Man that borrow 'd the Cane , and the Watch , and he 'll be hang 'd . James Fitzgerald . I am a Writing Clerk at Poplar , tat I live upon , and phat I have to stay but slender in Fact . The Prosecutor wash after tanking advish of me concerning to Watch and to Cane , and sait now I told him it wash no Felony , but a Fraud or a Treshpash . Then said Glin I will shwear te Cup upon him , and tat will hang him , and tho we shall get the Reward , and ten I can pay my Landlady te 39 s. Court . But you who prosess the Law , might have told them there was no Reward in such Cases . Fitz . Yeshfait , and sho I did . Court . Then they know now that there is no Reward , and therefore they must swear without the Hope of any . Fitz . Tat ish very true indeed . Glin . This Fitzgerald has been an Informer these thirty Years . Prosecutor . He makes it his Business to go about and swear away Peoples Lives . Fitz . Arrah fait , now I never wash an Evidensh in any Cant before . A . Blunt . Did you never prosecute a Woman here , and give Evidence against her for picking your Pocket of a Watch + [ a-part to Fitzgerald . ] + See the Trial of Susannah Grimes , for privately stealing a silver Watch , and 15 s 6 d. from James Fitzgerald ; in the Sessions Paper , for April , 1725 ; Printed for George James in Little-Britain . Fitzgerald . Yesh fait , that wash when I pulled and she pulled , and sho for fear she should get it from me , I let go my bold . A . Blunt . You remember the very Words that you swore then , and yet now you swear you never was an Evidence . Fitz . Be my shoul and that ish right , for I wash no Evidensh , because I wash an Evidensh for my shelf . A . Blunt . An Evidence , and no Evidence . Fitz . Fait now I did not shay that I wash no Evidence . A . Blunt . You only swore it . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner .
