They sat in the next Box to me , and asked what o'Clock it was ; I shewed them my Watch , and it was then past 2 . They staid to drink a Pint of Two-penny , and then went away . In a few Minutes I parted with my Friends , and went down Princes-street , into Lincoln's-Inn-Fields , and turned on the same Side with the Duke of Newcostle 's House : I immediately heard a Noise at my Heels , like the running of a Man , and turning about , saw the Prisoner Hunt , with the same Coat on as he has now ; he attempted to hide himself , and I being suspicious of some Mischief , walked as fast as I could till I got up to the Corner ; then the Prisoner Cassody came up and ran a Pistol into my Mouth , and said , Stand and deliver , or you are a Dead Man ! he advanced on me , and the Lamps shone in his Face .

On the Monday following , I went with him and some other Persons , in Search of the Prisoners , and accordingly went to a House in Drury-Lane , that harbours these People , where we had not staid long , before Hunt and Cassody went by , and the Prosecutor knew them to be the Persons that robb 'd him .

I went with some other Persons , and secur 'd Hunt , but in the Skirmish he cut my Hand almost off . Mrs. Fastnege I keep the Coach and Horses in Drury-Lane . The two Prisoners came to my House and drank a Pint of Two-penny at the same Time that Mr. Briton and his Friends were there ; Hunt asked what o'Clock it was ? and Briton pulled out his Watch , and said it was past 2 .

The Indictment farther charged , that he , the said Brabant , the said forged Order did publish , well knowing the same to be false , forged , and counterfeit . George Clark . I am Clerk to Mr. Martin and Comp . Bankers in Lombard-street . Councel . Do you know Mr. James Tipper ? Clark . Yes , he keeps Cash at my Master 's ; the Prisoner was his Book-keeper . Councel . Do you remember the Prisoner 's coming to your Master 's Shop with Draughts for Money ? Clark . Yes , on the 31st of December last , he brought me this Note for ten Guineas , and I paid him . Councel . Look on the Name at the Bottom : whose Name is that ? Clark . I took it to be Mr. Tipper 's Handwriting , otherwise I should not have paid the Prisoner . Councel . Did he bring any other besides this ten Guinea Note ? Clark . Yes , the Day afterwards ( New-Year's-Day ) he brought another for 50 Guineas , and I paid it to him . Councel . You keep New-Year's-Day as a Holiday ; did he make no Excuse for coming then ? Clark . He said his Master was going out of Town , and desired it might be paid . John Ellis . I know Mr. Tipper very well , and am acquainted with his Hand writing . Councel . Look on those two Notes ; do you take those Notes , or any Part of them , to be Mr. Tipper 's Hand-writing ? Mr. Ellis . No , neither the Signing , nor the Body of the Notes . I have been conversant with his Hand above 20 Years , and have seen him write a hundred times . John Goodeve . I have known Mr. Tipper upwards of sixteen Years , and have seen him write often . Councel . Do you think those Notes were wrote by Mr. Tipper ? Mr. Goodeve . No , I am of Opinion they are not , for this Reason ; this seems to be wrote after some Copy , and is a stiff Sort of a Hand . Mr. Ellis . I observe there is a Sriffness , as if the Person was got into an unusual Course : It wants the Freedom of an Original ; they are pretty well done , but there is a Heaviness which will be in all Copies . Joseph Orr . I know Mr. Tipper ; he went into Essex the 30th of Dec. and did not return till New-Year's-Day at Night . Mr. Clark . The Prisoner brought the Note in the Forenoon to our Shop . A Witness . I have known Mr. Tipper 4 Years , and am frequently with him at the Water Side when Tobacco 's are weigh 'd . Councel . Do you think those Notes are his Hand-writing ? Witness . No , I believe not . The Prisoner was employ 'd by my Master ( Mr. Tipper ) to write and improve me in Accompts : He had a very good Hand at imitating , for I have heard him say , he could do any Gentleman 's Hand if he saw it but once , to such an Exactness , that it should not be distinguished from the Original . I saw him counterfeit a Gentleman 's Hand from a Frank so nicely , that I could not discern the Difference . John Nichols . I was with Mr. Tipper at Baddow in Essex , on the 31st of Dec. last ; I came from thence with him on New-Year's-Day , and parted with him at Rumford . Mr. Clark . When the Prisoner brought these Notes to our Shop , I desired him to write his Name , and where he liv 'd , on the Back , and I saw him write Thomas Noble , while I was telling him the Money . Councel . We shall now call Thomas Noble to prove that Mr. Tipper had no Dealings with him on the 21st of Dec. last . Thomas Noble . I never had any Dealings with him at all . Prisoner . I am innocent of the Affair ; I only desire Mr. Tipper would give me a Character . Mr. Tipper . I am a Tobacco-Broker . The Prisoner was recommended to me as a Person out of Place , and wrote a good Hand . While he was with me he behaved very well , and I had not the least Reason to suspect him . On the 30th of Dec. last I had Occasion to go down into Essex , and left the Prisoner in Care of my House : I returned on New-Year's-Day at Night , and the Prisoner had left the House and taken the Keys away with him , so that I was forc 'd to set a Ladder up against the Window , and put a Boy in . Councel . Did you leave any Letter which you had wrote in the Prisoner 's Custody . Mr. Tipper . Yes , I left a Letter open , and ordered him to insert some Particulars , but when I came Home it was not done . Councel . Look on those Notes ; are either of them your Writing ? Mr. Tipper . No , neither the Signing nor the Body of the Notes ; neither had I ever any Dealings with Thomas Noble . Guilty on both Indictments , Death . 41.

Thomas Reveley . About three Weeks ago , I ca n't tell the Day , I made all my Doors fast , and went to Bed , and in the Morning when I got up , my House was broke open , and robb 'd of the Things mentioned in the Indictment . Some Time afterwards the Prisoner Robinson brought me two Spoons , a Knife , and a Heater , and begged to be admitted an Evidence . Ann Reynolds . I am 15 Years of Age , and if I speak any Thing but the Truth , my Soul will be damned to all Eternity . On Sunday Night about three Weeks ago , the two Prisoners and I went to this old Man 's House , and took with us a Co in a Tea Pot , by which we got a Light . Middleton broke a Board down , and unbolted two Bolts , and we went into the Shop . They carry 'd me with them , because I cou 'd get through a smaller Place than they : When we were got into the Shop , we filled a Bag with Iron , and sent Robinson Home with it . Than Middleton and I went backward , to get into the Kitchen ; out the Window which looked into the Yard being shut , she forced it open with a Fork , and put me in , and I opened the Door to her . We took from thence ten Pewter Plates , and a great many other Things , and delivered them to Robinson , who carried Home as many of them as she could at a Time . When all these Things were carried away , and we were going Home , Middleton who had been the old M Lodger , ran up Stairs with a Knife in her Hand , and said , she would kill the old Man and his Wife , for she knew they had Money in a Corner Cupboard , and she certainly would have done it , if Robinson and I had not pulled her down Stairs . Middleton . Did I ever propose killing Mr. Reveley ? Reynolds . Indeed you did ; - I have said nothing out the Truth . Mary Macneal . I lodge in Reveley 's House ; when the Prisoners were taken , my Cap was found hanging on a Line in this Middleton 's Room , and my Hat was on one of their Heads , when they were before the Justice . The Prisoner Middleton lodged at Reveley 's about two Years ago . Elizabeth Robinson . I am the Prisoner 's Sister , and never heard any Ill of her till she was unfortunately drawn in by bad Company . Ann Truby . I always thought Robinson a very honest Girl . Mary Matthews . I never knew her to be guilty of wronging any Body . Both Guilty , Death . 47. George Reeves , was indicted for stealing five Iron Bars , value 2 s. 6 d. fixed to the House of Alexander Blasdell , Feb. 24 . Acquitted . 48. of London , Gent . was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on the 28th Day of Jan in the Parish of St. Paul , Covent Garden , on Alexander Watson , in the Peace , & c. feloniously , willfully , and of his Malice aforethought , did make an Assault , and with a certain drawn Sword made of Iron and Steel , value 12 d. which he the said V - in his right Hand had and held , on the inside of the left Thing of him the said Watson did strike and stab , giving him then and there , & c one Mortal Wound of the Breadth of one Inch , and Depth of 6 Inches , of which from the said 28th of Jan to the 16th of Feb. he languish 'd , and languishing liv 'd , and then in the said Parish of St. Paul , Covent-Garden , died . He was a 2 d Time indicted on the Statute of Stabbing ; And a 3d Time by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquisition , for feloniously laying the said Alexander Watson . John Stainbank . I made out a Process from his Majesty 's Palace Court , against the Gentleman at the Bar , Mr. V - , at the Suit of Thomas Turner , for 150 l. It was read. `` George the 2d , by the Grace of God , & c. `` To the Bearer of the Bargess of our Household , `` Officers , and Masters , & c. We command `` you , and ever of you , to take the Bodies of `` V - A - , and John Doe , and bring `` them before us , & c. Stainbank . I gave this Writ into the Plaintiff Mr. Turner 's Hands , and at that Time , the Deceased Watson was one of the Bearers of the Verges . Thomas Turner . This was a Debt which was contracted in the Years 1731 and 32 , by the Prisoner and his Mother . In the Year 32 , I took a Joint Note of the Prisoner and his Mother , and in Dec. following , I took a Joint Bond of them . I waited six Months after it became due , and then added the Interest and the Principal , and took a Joint Bond in Dec. 33 , and in Easter Term 36 , my Father obtained a Judgement against the Prisoner in the Court of Common-Pleas . In the Year 38 , I ( being Administrator to my Father ) employ 'd a Man to watch the Prisoner a long Time , but to no Purpose , for he liv 'd at Whitehall , in the Verge of the Court . But in Jan. last , I was informed that I might take him in the Piazza in Covent-Garden ; upon that I got a Marshal 's Court Writ , and gave it to the Deceased to Execute , on the 27th of Jan. about 8 in the Evening ; at the same Time desiring him to use Mr. V - handsomely , and not expose him . Councel . Who gave you the Information where you might take Mr. V - ? Turner . The same Person whom I had employ 'd to watch him ; he came to me the 27th of Jan. and told me he saw Mr. V - go into a House in the Piazza , upon that I gave Watson the Writ , and the next News I heard was that he was wounded . Thomas Watson . The Deceased Alexander Watson was my Father . On the 28th of Jan. between 7 and 8 in the Evening , Mr. Turner gave my Father this Writ in the Piazza , Covent Garden , with Orders to execute it on the Prisoner , and to use him well . We waited from 8 o'Clock till 4 in the Morning , before Mr. Fry 's Door , and then the Prisoner and four other Gentleman came out . The Prisoner parted with his Company , and went towards James street , upon that my Father bid me and his Assistants keep at a Distance , for he would go and speak to the Gentleman himself ; he then went up to Mr. V - , and pull 'd off his Hat , and said , Mr. V - I have a Warrant against you : Immediately the Prisoner dropp 'd his Cane , drew his Sword , and stabb 'd my Father in the inside of the left Thigh After this was done , my Father cry 'd , he has stabb 'd me ! he has murder 'd me ! and the Prisoner attempted to run to Mr. Fry 's , but Mr. Linney stopp 'd him , and threw him down ; the Hilt and part of the Blade of the Sword was in the Prisoner 's Hand , and the rest of the Blade la , by my Father . Councel . How could you at 4 in the Morning discern all this ? Watson It was neither light nor dark , but a fine Morning , besides there was a Lamp about 3 Doors from the Place where this was done . Councel . Who was with your Father ? Watson . There were Thomas Linney , Evan Jenkins ( whom Mr. Turner had employ 'd to watch the Prisoner ) and myself . Prisoner 's Q Where did your Father stand when I came out ? Watson . We all stood in the Piazza , and when Mr. V - came out , Jenkins said , That is the Man , and my Father follow 'd him alone . Pris . Q Did you apprehend it was difficult to get at me ? Watson . Yes , I have heard Turner say , he had a deal of Trouble . Pris . Q Was there any Noise or Disturbance in the Street ? Watson . No , it was very still and quiet , so that a Voice might easily be heard . Thomas Linney . On the 27th of Jan about 9 at Night . I was at the Blue-Posts Alehouse in Covent Garden , and the Deceased came and desired me to assist him to arrest a Gentleman who lived in the Verge of the Court . I went with him into the Piazza , and staid till 4 in the Morning , and then Mr. V - with 3 or 4 more came out of Mr. Fry 's House . Mr. V - parted with his Friends , and went towards James street , the Chairman ( Evan Jenkins ) said , That is the Man , and the Deceased said he would speak to him in a handsome manner ; accordingly he went up to the Prisoner , pull 'd off his Hat and said , Mr. V - . your humble Servant , I have a Warrant against you . Immediately the Prisoner dropp 'd his Cane , drew his Sword , and stuck him directly Councel . Was there no Provocation given ? Linney . No . none at all , no body spoke to him but the Deceased , for he bid us keep at a Distance . As soon as the Deceased was stabb 'd , he cry 'd out , I am killed , I am stabb 'd ! and the Prisoner attempted to get back to Mr. Fry 's , but I follow 'd him , and kick 'd up his Heels . Councel . Was the Prisoner thrown down before , or after the Wound was given ? Linney . It was after the Deceased cried out , and the Prisoner was running away . Councel . Did you observe with what sort of Weapon the Wound was given ? Linney . It was a three edg 'd Sword ; I believe this is the same , but when I saw it , it was all over Blood Councel . By what Light did you see all this ? Linney . It was light enough , and I was within 2 Yards of them all the Time . Councel Did the Deceased assault Mr. V - ? Linney . No , he never touched him at all , but spoke to him very civilly . Councel . How long did the Deceased live after this ? Linney I believe he might live about three Weeks . Councel . Was there any Noise or Tumult in the Street at this Time ? Linney . No , there was not a Soul stirring , till we called the Watch . Councel . Are you positive there was no Provocation given ? Linney . No other than the Deceased 's telling him he had a Warrant against him , and immediately the Prisoner stabb 'd him , and ran away as fast as he could , and his Hat and Wig fell off . Evan Jenkins , deposed to the same Effect . Mr. Perkins , Surgeon . I did not attend the Deceased in his Life Time , but was present and opened the Body after he was dead . I observ 'd a Wound on his Thigh , which penetrated 5 or 6 Inches downwards , and had passed the Crural Artery . There had been a counter opening made by the Surgeon who attended him , for the Discharge of Matter ; I examined it , and on the opposite Side , I found a large Quantity of Matter , and a Mortification begun . I th en open 'd the Abdomen , and on examining the Intestines , I found a large Quantity of Pus or Matter , in one of the Kidneys , and likewise in the Lobes of the Lungs ; and on inspecting the Stomach , I found above half a Pint of Corruption ting 'd with Blood . Councel . Do you think that this Wound was the Occasion of his Death ? Mr. Perkins . I ca n't say it was the immediate Cause of his Death . Councel . Is it your Opinion , that this Man would have died by any Disorder that was on him if he had not received this Wound ? Mr. Perkins . No , I believe he would not . Mr. Price , Surgeon . I was sent by the Prisoner to take Care of the Deceased the Day after he received the Wound . It was about 3 Inches below the Groin in the middle of the Thigh , and [ Pages missing in original . ] was almost closed up ; I dilated it to promote a Discharge of Matter . The next Day the Wound had a good Aspect , but he was feverish , and troubled with a Looseness ; and continued to till the 3d of this Month , and then I observ 'd a Hardness about the Wound . The Fever and Looseness ( notwithstanding our Applications ) increased daily more and more , to the Day of his Death , but the last Time I saw Mr. Kilpatrick dress the Wound , it was in as good a State of healing as possibly could be , and from that Time I never saw the Deceased any more . Councel . In your Judgment did the receiving this Wound contribute to his Death ? Mr. Price . In the whole Course of this Wound , I did not observe any Symptoms which I can fairly say were the Occasion of his Death . He had the Looseness after we had remov 'd all those Symptoms from the Wound . Jury . We apprehend that the Deceased was of a bad Constitution , therefore do you not imagine , that so great an Effusion of Blood , might occasion his Death ? Mr. Price . A little Blood makes a great Shew , but I am very certain , no large Vessel was wounded , for the first Application we made was only a bit of Lint , about the bigness of a 6 d. and a Plaister . Councel . Do you not imagine that the Loss of so much Blood occasioned the Loosness . Mr. Price . No , I do n't know but that it might prolong his Life , for in the Loosness the first Thing I could have done to relieve him , must have been to have taken Blood from him William Kirk . I knew the Deceased very well , and saw him the Day before his Death ; I looked on him before he received this Wound , to be as hearty and strong as any Man . He never made any Complaints , but went about his Business , and always had an exceeding good Appetite . I saw him after he was wounded , and likewise his Breeches , Shoes and Stockings , and I believe he had bled a Hat full . John Fryer . I was acquainted with the Deceased 10 or 11 Years . I saw him 2 or three Days before his Decease , and he was then strong and hearty , and made no Complaints . Thomas Watson . When the Surgeons gave my Father his Physic , it brought a Loosness on him , for he never had one before . Before he receiv 'd this Wound he was very hearty , and I never knew him have a Day 's Illness in my Life . Isaac Itorno I knew the Deceased 10 or 11 Years , and used to see him every Day . I was with him a Day or two before this Accident happen 'd , at the Sun in Russel-street , he appear 'd then to be strong and hearty , and made no Complaints , but eat and drank well . Mary Thomas I lived in the House with the Deceased three Years , and he was as well as any one here , before this happened . I attended him in his Illness , and he never was out of his Bed but once , to take a Vomit , and then he was so bad , that he was forced to go to Bed again . DEFENCE . I was coming from Mr Van Blake 's , and they all rushed upon me ; I thought they were Robbers , and wounded one of them in the Scuffle . Edward Mount . I am an Engraver . On the 28th of January , between 4 and 5 in the Morning , I had been Gaming at the Lady Castile 's , and coming through the Great Piazza , Covent-Garden , I saw Mr. Fry 's Door open , and the Prisoner and some others come out ; and immediately I heard Watson say , D - me , there he is ! The Prisoner parted with his Friends , and turned towards James-street ; Watson hid himself by a Barber 's Shop , and then they all rushed on Mr. V - in the hottest Manner . They presently got him to the Ground , and then I heard them say , D - n you , you Dog , I have a Warrant against you ! And soon afterwards I heard Watson complain he was stabb 'd . It was a very still Morning , and if any Person had come up to him , and told him of a Writ , I must have heard it . Councel . Did you hear any Body cry , he was stabb 'd , before you heard of the Warrant ? Mount . They said nothing about a Warrant till Watson complain 'd of being stabb 'd . Mr. V - said , he thought they were Thieves , No , d - n you ( said he ) I have a Warrant against you . I was so near , and the Night so still , that I could hear and see every Thing that passed . Councel . Did not you see the Prisoner run away without his Hat and Wig ? Mount . No , he did not run away , but I saw him without his Hat and Wig . - They all rush 'd on him at once ; and I saw no Sword drawn , but I heard Watson say , he was stabbed . Councel . When did you make this Discovery ? Mount . I went to Mr. Fry 's , Two or Three Days afterwards , and told him what I had seen . Mr. Kingston . I have known the Prisoner 7 or 8 Years ; he lives in Scotland Yard , but I never apprehended that he lived there for Shelter , for he always went abroad as other Gentlemen go . As to his Temper , I never saw him in a Passion in my Life ; and do n't think he would do a Fact of this Nature . - Hardy . I keep George 's Coffee-House , without Temple-Bar , and have known the Prisoner ten Years . He used to come to my House at least 4 times a Week , and always sat in the most conspicuous Part of the Coffee-Room . He was at my House the 27th of January , and told me he was to dine with Mr. Clark , and to spend the Evening with Mr. Van Blake . I have no Reason to think the Bailiffs were in any Danger of losing him , for he is lame , and not able to make the least Speed , so that a Man that walks fast may easily get Ground of him . As to his Temper , I never knew him to be quarrelsome or rash , but rather the reverse . Mr. Clark . I have known the Prisoner from a Child : He dined with me the Day this Accident happened . As to his Character , I always took him to be a good , honest Man , and one that would pay every Body ; but his being Security for his Mother , brought him into some Trouble , more than any Extravagance of his own . Mr. Van Blake . Mr. V - supped with me at Mr. Fry 's , and staid till 4 o'Clock the Night this Accident happened . I have known him ten Years , and did not apprehend that he was in any Fear of an Arrest : I have been to several Coffee-Houses with him , and he never seemed shy in the least , but always sat in the public Room frequently two Hours together . I always found him to be a good natur 'd , humane , generous Man , and do n't think he would draw his Sword on a Man without some Surprize . Mr Trion . I have known Mr. V - from his Childhood . He always appear 'd publickly without any Interruption ; and I do n't believe that he lived at Whitehall for Shelter . I always took him to be a very sweet Tempered Man . Edward Rushworth . I have known him about a Year and a half , and came acquainted with him by applying to him for a Debt due to a Relation of mine . He told me how his Circumstances were , and I said I would not press him for the Money , and from that Time he never secreted himself from me . Edward Bathurst . I have known him between 6 and 7 Years . He always appear 'd publickly , and not as a Person who liv 'd in Fear of his Creditors . Mrs. Knight . I live at Mr. Blake 's . I remember Mr. V - 's being at our House ; he staid till 4 in the Morning , and then I lit him to the Door , where he staid talking ten Minutes , and his Friends turned towards Russel-street , but he went up James street . He did not seem to be under any Apprehension of an Arrest , but came frequently to our House , and if any Stranger had asked for him , I should have called him down or let him have known it Mr. Rayswell . I supp 'd at Mr. Blakes with the soner . We staid 'till 4 in the Morning , and then came down to the Door together where he staid some Time pressing me to go Home with him . I have known him several Years , and he has not been used to secret himself . Col. Stevens I knew Mr. V - last Summer , and never thought him subject to quarrelling . Mr. De Viel . Mr. V - was brought before me and gave the same Account , as he has done here . I knew the Deceased and his Housekeeper Mary Thomas . Mrs. Thomas bears a very bad Character , and I have had her and the Deceased before me for Felony : The Son ( Tho Watson , ) hath been before me , but I ca n't recollect the Particulars . Capt . Nevet . I have known the Prisoner upwards of 10 Years ; he frequently came to my Lodgings , in Arundel street , and commonly came on Foot . I always took him to be of a very mild Disposition . Mr. Revis . I have known him 4 Years , and always thought him a very honest Man . Samuel Bannister . I have known Edward Mount a Dozen Years , and I believe he would say nothing but the Truth . The Jury withdrew and after a short Time returned and found the Prisoner Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 49.

On the 6th of January , about 10 at Night , I and 3 more were going along Whitechapel , and saw 2 Men which proved to be the Prisoner and John Simkin knocking at the Three Crown 's Door ; immediately Simkin rushed on me , and knock 'd me down , and hearing the Deceased 's Voice in the House , as I lay on the Ground , I called him to assist me , but I did not see him till I saw him dead in the Rose and Crown Alehouse . Councel . Did you see the Prisoner strike the Deceased ? Galcoigne . No , I was fighting with Simkin . Councel . Was you present when the Prisoner was before the Justice ? Galcoigne . Yes , and this Tuck was shewn to him ; he own 'd it , and said it was given him by his Father to one Lloyd who went with him to Bromley , and that he brought it all the Way back to the Place where the Murder was committed . Henry Hollaly . I am a Headborough , belonging to Mile End Old Town On the 6th of January , I was in Company with the Deceased , and some others , and did not miss him out of the Company 'till I went away . I parted from the Company about 10 o'Clock , and going by the Rose and Crown , I saw 2 Men scuffling together ; I went a little farther to the Anchor and Crown , and saw 2 other Men fighting . I turn 'd about , and a Woman came out of the Rose and Crown , and said Porter was murder 'd ; I went into the House , and found him sitting by the Fireside , and the Prisoner standing by him : The Prisoner , said he , had been abused , and desired I would take his Part ; the Deceased turn 'd up his Eyes , and fell down ; I saw some Blood on his Coat , and on stripping his Coat open , the Blood flow 'd from him : I then ask 'd the Prisoner if he had done it ; and he said , he had been Fighting with him , and had done it . Councel . Was it before or after the Deceased fell from his Chair that this pass 'd . Hollaly . I think it was after I had seen the Wound ; I said Child , I hope you have not been Fighting and done this , and he said , yes , I have . After this , I search 'd the Prisoner , but found no Weapon on him ; upon that , I got a Candle and Lanthorn , and went to the Door , and a Person who was with me , found this naked Tuck , all dirty and bloody . I shew 'd it to the Prisoner , and ask 'd him if he knew it ; but I was then deaf , and could not hear whether he made any Answer . The next Morning he was carried before Justice Ricards , and said there , that his Father lent that Weapon to Mr. Lloyd , of Bromley , who gave it back again into his Hands . Sarah Campion . I was coming out of my own House , and saw the Deceased come out , and stand within the Step of the Three Crown Door . There were two Men fighting at the Door , and a third Man , which proved to be the Prisoner , stepp 'd up between them ; but the Deceased , push 'd him off , and drove him by the Shoulders into the Rose and Crown , and never left him . Soon after this , I heard the Deceased 's Wife scream out ; I ran into the House , and saw the Deceased ( as I thought ) dead , and the Prisoner standing by the Fire . The next Morning the Prisoner was carried before Justice Ricards , and said , his Father lent the Weapon to Mr. Lloyd , of Bromley , that Lloyd gave him and another 6 d. a-piece , and a Tankard of Beer to see him Home , and that he brought the Tuck all the Way back himself . Councel . Do you think that the Deceased push 'd the Prisoner off in Order to keep the Peace ? Campion . Yes , I believe it was to prevent his Interposing . Francis Green . On the 6th of January the Deceased was at my House , in Company with Mr. Hollaly , and his Wife , and some other Neighbours .

I went there , and found him expiring , and the Prisoner standing by the Fire side ; I search 'd him , and found no Weapon on him , but presently this Tuck was brought in very dirty and bloody . I put the Prisoner and Simkin into the Cage , and I heard the Prisoner say , D - n you , I may thank you for this ; Simkin , replied , You Rogue , Had you been my Lord Mayor , you would have done the same . Councel . Did you ever hear the Prisoner own the Dagger Green . The first Time it was shewn to him , he deny 'd it , but before the Justice , he own 'd that Lloyd deliver 'd it to him , and that he brought it all the Way to the Place where this happened . Ann Porter , the Deceased 's Widow My Husband had parted with the Company , and we were going Home to Bed ; He went into the Rose and Crown , and I had hardly turn 'd myself round , when I heard a Noise like 2 Men striving together ; I turn 'd into the Entry , and met my Husband holding the Prisoner . When I came in , my Husband let the Prisoner go , and said , There , that is he that has kill 'd me , and pointed with his Finger to the Wound ; he then fix 'd his Eyes on the Ceiling , and never spoke Words more . Councel . Did your Husband speak loud enough for the Prisoner to hear , when he said , That is the Man ? Porter . Yes ; and the Prisoner said nothing at all to it . Charles Ward . On the 6th of January , the Deceased , and some other Friends had been at Supper : About 10 o'Clock , he left the Company , and in a few Minutes , News was brought that he was murdered . I went to the House where he was , and saw him dead , and the Prisoner standing by the Fire . We got a Light , and went out of Doors to look for the Weapon , and I pick 'd up this Tuck all dirty and bloody , within six Yards of the Door . Sarah Marsh . On the 7th of January , coming by the Watch-House , I saw the Prisoner and John Simkin , and the Prisoner cried , and said , Oh ! Mrs. Marsh , I am the Person that kill 'd the Man ! Prisoner 's Q . How came you to go to the Watch-House ? Marsh I live at Mile End , and going by the Watch-House , I saw a Croud , and look 'd in .

He made no Answer , but the Deceased pointed to him , and said , That is he , and died instantly . Thomas Hiat . I ask 'd the Deceased who did it , and he pointed to the Prisoner , and said , This is he : The Prisoner was close by him at the same Time and made no Answer to this . Councel . Was you present when the Weapon was brought in ? Hiat . Yes , and it was shewn to the Prisoner , but he deny 'd that it was his . Ephraim Holton .

Yes ; and they followed me into the Entry . Councel . Did you hear what the Deceased said in the Entry ? Thorp . No , I did not . John Marsh . I was going from the Rose and Crown , to the Three Crowns , and on one Side of the Path , I saw the Deceased , and another , ( whom the People said was Touchbury 's Son ) struggling together . There were Blows between them , but how many I ca n't tell . I went on a little farther , and saw Gascoigne and Simkin on the Ground . I took up Simkin , and went into the Three Crowns , where I saw the Prisoner sitting by the Fire-side , and the People said he had kill 'd Porter . John Simkin . On Monday Night , I had done Work , and just at the Three-Crowns Door , Gascoigne tought with me , when we were on the Ground , he called Porter to assist him , and he came up and fell on young Mr. Touchbury .

When I saw the Prisoner that Night , his Cheek was Bloody , and to the best of my Knowledge , Blood came out of his Ears . Councel . How long was Gascoigne engag 'd with you , before he called the Deceased to his Assistance ? Simkin . I had but one Blow before Porter came out ; we were just going at it as he came out . Councel . Was you on the Ground or not ? you said just now you was on the Ground . Simkin . I was not quite down nor quite up ; the Coat I had about me was enough to fling me down . Councel . Was you not on your Back , and had not Gascoigne his Hand in your Collar ? Simkin . Yes , he had his Hand in my Collar to be sure . Councel . If you was on the Ground how could you see what Porter was doing ? Simkin . I was not quite down ; - I was three Parts up , and three Parts down . Councel . Did not you and Gascoigne close together ?
