The Court let him know , that he might have retained Councel if he pleased , for it was not denied in Cases of Trespass . The said Ralphson continued to ask several unusual Questions : As by what Warrant the Marshal came to seize him ? Whether they could Swear he was the Publisher ; and whether the laying it to be Written , Printed , and Publlisht the 12th of November , did not make void the Indictment , since it was a thing not attainable to be done in one day : Which Questions being all very easily Answered . He yet continued to use some kind of Reflections upon the Court , as if he admired that any Protestant Court should think his Book a Reflection ; pretending it only tended to disclaim all Jesuitical Clangs and Cabals .
