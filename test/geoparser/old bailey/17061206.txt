WITH The True COPIES of the Letters produced in Court . Printed by Authority . ROBERT Fielding , Esq ; was Indicted for that , heon the 25th Day of Nov 1705. did Feloniously take to him to Wife Barbara , Duchess of Cleveland , his First Wife being then alive . The First Evidence for the Queen , and the only one to Prove the Fact was Mrs. Villars : She deposed that one Mrs. Streat came to her , and acquainted her , that Mr . Fielding was passionatly in Love with one Mrs. Deleau , a Lady of Quality at Waddon in Surrey , worth 60000 Pounds ; that Mrs. Streat desired her to use her Interest ( she being an Acquaintance of Mrs. Deleau 's ) to bring Mr . Fielding , and the Lady together ; that Mr . Fielding went into the Country , not doubting , but if once the Lady could have a Sight of him , she would have the same Respect for him as he had for her ; that when he came there , he desired to see the Gardens , and was by the Servants so introduc 'd , that he saw a Lady look out of a Window , whom he thought to be Mrs. Deleau , and that she might have the more perfect View of him , he was pleased to take divers Turns in the Garden , and set his Watch by the Sun-Dial ; when Mr . Fielding return 'd home again , he acquainted Mrs. Villars with his Adventure . She further deposed , that Mr. Fieldings Project being very unlikely to take , she and Mrs. Streat propos 'd one of their own , that tho ' they could not help Mr . Fielding to Mrs. Deleau , however , they would impose upon him one that should personate her , and be more agreeable to his Fortune ; the Person they fix 'd on for him , was one Mrs. Mary Wadsworth , Mrs. Villars further deposed , that she promis 'd to persuade Mrs. Deleau to come privately to his Lodgings in the Pell Mell ; that after she had been there a while , he should come in and make an Improvement of his fortunate coming in that Happy Minute : But when the Time appointed came , instead of Mrs. Deleau , Mrs. Wadsworth appeared in her Shape , with a Mourning Coach , and Widows Habit . She had not been there long , but in comes Mr . Fielding , wonderfully surprized with Joy to see his Lady there ; that he made his Addresses to her after a very Passionate Manner , and that he entertained the Lady with a Treat , and some Italian and English Songs , sung by Margaretta , whom he sent for , for that Purpose ; that Mr . Fielding proposed to Marry her , that the Lady seemed Shy , and entertained his Loving Disposition , with an agreeable Modesty ; but before she went , she let him know when he might see her again . But instead of her coming , according to Promise , she sent him a Letter to excuse her self , and appointed another time ; Mr . Fielding return 'd an Answer , in which he express 'd abundance of Fervour , and said , there wanted nothing but the Holy Father to make them one , for that their Hearts were one already . Mrs. Villars farther deposed , that on the 9th of November , Mrs. Wadsworth and her self , came to Mr . Fielding 's Lodgings , that Mr . Fielding was not at home when they came ; but in a little time he came , and took his Lady into his Arms , and said , he would fetch the Priest ; the Lady would have had it put off till another time ; but she could not persuade him to it ; that he then went out and lock 'd the Door after him ; within three quarters of an Hour he came again , and brought a Priest , called the Red Father , with a long Red Gown lin 'd with Blue , a long Beard , and a Fur Cap . Mrs. Villars farther deposed , that Mr . Fielding said , This is the Holy Father that is to make us one , that then his Man Bowcher was ordered to bring in the Supper , which was done accordingly . Mrs. Villars farther deposed , thatMrs . Wodsworth questioned the Priest , and said , how shall I know you are a Priest in Orders ; the Priest put his Hand into his Pocket and pull 'd out a Paper of the Pope 's Picture , about the bigness of a Crown Piece , and said , that none but Priests us 'd to carry those Pictures about 'em . She desired some other Token , at which he shew 'd her a Scarf ; Bowcher was sent for Water , Salt , and Rosemary , to make Holy Water ; that he brought up the Water and Salt , but could procure no Rosemary : Bowcher being sent away , the Marriage was solemniz 'd in Mr . Fielding 's Bed Chamber , there being none present but the Bride and Bridegroom , the Priest and her Self ; that she remembred , the Ceremony of the Ring , the Priest blessing it , and crossing himself , and that the Sacrament of Marriage was read in Latin . She farther deposed , that Mrs. Wadsworth , when they came to this part , Wilt thou take this Woman to be thy Wedded Wife , desired it might be read in English , at which Mr . Fielding caused him not to proceed ; but the Priest not understanding English , Mr . Fielding supplied that Defect , and said the same Words , with this Addition ; With all my Heart , and with all my Soul , and required Mrs. Wadsworth to do the same ; but she speaking it faintly : he desired her to speak it as heartily as he himself did . Then she uttered these Words ; I take this Man to be my Wedded Husband , with all my Heart , and with all my Soul . She farther deposed , when the Marriage was over , the Priest was discharged , and she put the Lady to Bed . This Evidence farther deposed , that she saw them in naked Bed together the next Morning ; and had seen them dress 'd and undress 'd 4 times in the space of seven Weeks . To strengthen Mrs. Villar 's Evidence , Bowcher was called , who deposed , that he saw the Priest , and brought the Salt and Water , and that he saw them in Bed together after this , divers times , and took them to be Man and Wife . There were several others that prov 'd the same . Another piece of Evidence was the Ring , which was produc 'd by the Proctor of Doctors Commons , with this Device engraven in it tibi Soli , for thee alone . The Goldsmith that made the Ring , deposed he made it by Mr . Fielding't Order , and the Device was Mr. Fieldings . Another that was when the Ring was bespoke , deposed the same . There were likewise produc 'd divers Pieces of Written Evidence which were prov 'd to be his Hand , wherein Mr . Fielding does acknowledge Mrs. Wadsworth to be his Wife ; and one in an especial manner , a Copy of which is as followeth : A LETTER : Directed to the best of Wives , Anne Countess of Fielding , at Waddon . Novemb . 14 . `` THere is nothing can please me more upon this Occasion , than to hear my Dear `` Wife say , I had made her sick by turning her Liver , for without that we could `` not hope for a young Lord Tunbridge , which would be next to my Dear herself the most `` welcome Present to my Arms ; make hast then my Dearest Life , to Cultivate the `` young Spark , and besure you do not starve my Boy ; as for your coming to me , it `` wholly depends upon your self , who can best Judge when it is most proper to come to `` me , which you can do , by your giving out you are to stay all Night in London ; and `` then you and Puggy have nothing to do but to come at Bed time , and so we may go `` to Bed and lye till Morning , when Puggy may come again and call you . Adieu my Souls Love , that I must ever value more than Life . Mr . Fielding , in his Defence , endeavour 'd to prove that Mrs. Wadsworth was Marry 'd to one Lily Bradley , to do which , the Register Book of the Fleet was produc 'd , and there was a Certificate of a Marriage between Lily Bradley and Mary Wadsworth ; but the Place where it was written , it being at the Bottom of a Leaf , the Colour of the Ink , and the Difference of the Hand , with divers other Circumstances , gave sufficient Reason to suspect the Truth of it . Evidence was call 'd to prove Mrs. Villars to be a Leud Woman . And among the Rest , one Mrs. Fletcher ; She deposed that Mrs. Villars confess 'd to her , That she had had two Bastards ; one by the Lord Torrington , and the other by the Lord Stamford . This Evidence was confronted by a Letter that was produc 'd by the other side , which Mr. Fletcher own 'd to be her Hand . Tuesday Morning . `` ALL that knows the Name of Major General Fielding , must own the Generous `` and Charitable Actions that your Honour daily bestows upon them ; and I `` among the Rest , shall ever acknowledge your Goodness ; it 's necessity that forces me `` to dispose of this Picture , your Honour 's a Nice Judge of Painting , as well as an Admirer `` and true Lover of such Pieces ; which makes me humbly present to you first , `` and in accepting the same , your Honour will highly oblige , as well as serve , Your humble Servant , M. FLETCHER . `` I long to see you , for your Encouragement to grant me that Favour ; I am now acquainted `` with a young Lady that is Pretty , and lives in good Fashion ; your Honour will `` oblige me , in letting me receive your Commands . The Tryal lasted very long , and the Jury having maturely weigh 'd the Evidence on both sides , they brought him in guilty of Felony .
