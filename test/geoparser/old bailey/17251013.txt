I got up again , and saw the other Prisoner , Robert Flood , who stood by , and bide Nichols beat me within an Inch of my Life . Nichols threw me down again : I got up a second time ; and then he catch 'd hold of my Hand , and pull 'd my Ring off my Finger , threw me a third time , and tore my Turnover off . Several People were by this time got about us ; but Flood bade them stand off , so that no body assisted me : However , I made shift to drag Nichols by the Collar to an Alehouse about 200 Yards off . We were follow 'd in by Robert Flood , and I had them both secured . Nathanael Sanderson thus deposed : Hearing a Noise in the Street , I went out and saw the Prosecutor holding Nichols by the Collar .

My Girl used to go thither every Morning to fetch me a quarter of an Ounce of Tea ; but I always sent Money for it . The Prisoner came to me one Night with some Fish in her Hand , and something wrapt up in three Papers . She seem 'd to be a little in Drink , and said she had dropt one of her Papers ; and therefore desired me to take care of the Fish and the other Papers , while she went back to see for it . I look 'd into the Papers when she was gone , and found that there was little Sugar 'd Kings in them . She came again and fetch 'd them away ; but whether she carry 'd them to a Customer , or did any thing else with them , I can not tell ; tho ' I never heard that Mrs. Coxeter had laid any thing to the Prisoner 's Charge , till she had been to a Fortune-teller in the Old Baily , who described a little black Woman to her . Elizabeth Lawrence thus deposed : The Prisoner has been my Servant about six Weeks , which is ever since she came from Mr. Coxeter , and I have found her to be so honest , industrious and faithful , and in all Respects such a good Servant , that if she was now at liberty , I would immediately take her into my House again .

Thomas Sleath thus deposed : Between five and six on Monday Morning , the Prisoner brought two Cows to me in Smithfield . He said they were his Master Barns 's at Totenham , and desired me to sell them for him . I sold them accordingly : and after Market , he came to me at an Alehouse to take the Money . I would have sold them myself , says he , but that I did not care to be seen in the Market , for fear William Smith should have arrested me . This gave me a little Suspicion of the Fellow ; and so before I paid him , I stept over to my Father and ask 'd his Advice . I 'll be hang 'd , says he , if this is not the Man that stole the other two Cows that were sold to William Smith . Whereupon I sent for Smith , and as soon as the Prisoner saw him , he ran away ; but he was taken again next Week , and confess 'd that himself and Collin Luff stole the Cows of Mr. Lloyd . Guilty .

There were Caps , Handkerchiefs , and Childbed-Linnen , a Silver worked Stomacher , a Child 's Frock and Petticoat , and other Things , and she sold them to a Woman that crys old Iron . The Prisoner thus made her Defence : It was not I that robb 'd Mr. Purcell , but it was that Girl there , his Daughter Mary ; for as young as she is , she has been guilty of Thieving from her Father for several Years .

Just without Temple-Bar , the Prisoner ( who was a Hackney-Coachman ) was fitting upon his Box ; he came down , left his Coach , and follow 'd the Hearse . I guess 'd at his Design , and caution 'd him several times not to meddle with the Escutcheons ; but he still push 'd forward , and as soon as the Burying was over , there was great Mobbing , and I saw him snatch the Escutcheon from the Hearse .

Benjamin Mills thus deposed : I heard somebody cry , stop Thief , whereupon I and another pursued the Prisoner , who fell down ; and so we took him and brought him back to Mr. Warren , who was coming to meet us as well as he could , for he was a little disguis 'd in Drink ; and by the way we found Mr. Warren 's Hat .

I laid up Mr. Janeway 's Watch in my Bed-Chamber ; but having lost the Key of the Door , I did not let any body know that the Watch was in my Possession : But however , I miss 'd it in two or three Days after , and had a violent Suspicion of the Prisoner , because she had been at Southwark-Fair , and brought home a Couple of Gold Rings , and other small Pieces of Plate .

Then the Prisoner reach 'd to the Dresser , and took up something , which I suppose was a Knife , ( for I could not see distinctly , because there was no Candle upon the Dresser ; ) but be it what it would , he stretch 'd out his Arm in this manner , and struck the Deceased thus ; who thereupon immediately sunk down , and died . - Middleton thus deposed : The Prisoner appeared in a very morose and quarrelsome Humour when he first came into the Kitchen . - You 're a sorry Dog , says he to the Deceased .

The Woman was going out , and the Prisoner would have follow 'd her ; but the Deceased hinder 'd him ; and presently after fell down , and died . The Maid thus deposed : The Prisoner was following my Mistress ; but the Deceased stopt him , and told him that he should not strike her in his Presence . I had just before laid this Case-Knife down upon the Dresser . The Prisoner took it up : I did not see him give the Blow ; but the Deceased sunk down by the Dresser , and died before we could get a Surgeon . We afterwards found this same Knife , all bloody , upon the Floor . The Surgeon deposed , that the Deceased had a mortal Wound in the Left Breast , between six and seven Inches deep ; and he believed it was given with such a Knife as that produced in Court . The Prisoner said nothing in his Defence ; but call 'd some of his Acquaintance to his Reputation , who gave him the Character of an honest , quiet , good-natur 'd Man ; and that on the contrary , the Deceased , when he was in Liquor , did use to be very fractious , and the most troublesome Man in Nature .

She said she put it upon her Partner 's Bed on the Monday Morning ; but it could not be found . I sent for a Constable , and had her before a Justice , thinking that might bring her to confess what she had done with it ; but she deny 'd it stiffly ; and as I could not prove it upon her , the Justice discharged her . The next Day she arrested me for Scandal ; and I was forced to carry my Cloaths to pawn , to pay the Charges . I beg 'd of the Pawnbroker to let me have as much as ever she could upon my Things , because I was arrested . She ask 'd me for what ? I told her it was for charging a Woman with taking a Bible that was lost . A Bible , says she ; What was the Woman 's Name ? Rachel , says I. Rachel ! And what besides Rachel ? says she . Why Pearson , says I. Ay , says she ; And do you know the Bible when you see it ? Yes , says I . Why then , says she , I 'll shew you a Bible that was pawn 'd here in the Name of Rachel Pearson : So she brings me a Bible , and it was the very same that we had lost .

He had lodged there between two and three Weeks , when one Afternoon Mr. Cash , who lived in the same House , went abroad and left the Key in his Chamber Door . The Prisoner , that he might have some Excuse for staying above Stairs , pretended that he had some Accounts to settle , and therefore desired his Landlady to lend him her Pen and Ink , which she did ; tho ' she afterwards found , that he could not write his own Name . While the People were busy below , he took an Opportunity of going into Mr. Cash 's Chambers , and stole his Mourning Coat and Wastecoat ; both which he put on , and button 'd his own old Coat over them . At Night he came down , and call 'd for a full Tankard of Beer ; and before he had empty 'd it , Mr. Cash came in and spoke to him , but did not perceive that he had any more Cloaths upon his Back than belong 'd to him . The Prisoner either seeing , or pretending that he saw an Acquaintance at the Door , call 'd out , Hah ! Paul , won t ye drink with me ? And so stept to the Door with the Tankard in his Hand , and went quite off with it . Mrs. Barwell heard no more of him , till an Advertisement in one of the News-Papers informed her , that such a Tankard as she had lost was offer 'd to Sale by such a Person as the Prisoner to Mr. Lake , a Goldsmith in Portsmouth ; that the Tankard was stopt , and the Prisoner taken into Custody for not giving a good Account how he came by it . Edith Barwell deposed , that upon reading this Advertisement , she wrote to Mr. Lake ; and upon his Answer , she went to Portsmouth , where she soon found her Tankard and the Prisoner . He fell upon his Knees , and beg 'd her to be favourable to him . She heard there , that he had pawn 'd a Mourning Coat and Wastecoat , which proved to be Mr. Cash 's , and she redeem 'd 'em . John Lake thus deposed : This is the Tankard that the Prisoner offer 'd to Sale at my Shop in Portsmouth : I examin 'd who he was , and how he came by it ? My Name , says he , is John Barry , and the Tankard was left me by my Uncle Edward Barry , who is lately dead in Ireland , and these two Letters E and B stand for his Name . Not thinking this Account satisfactory , I had him before the Mayor , who committed him to the Town Prison ; and upon my publishing an Advertisement , Mrs. Barwell came down . When she saw the Prisoner , she asked him if he knew her ? And he answer 'd , Yes , Madam , to my Shame , - my Life is in your Hands . The Prisoner thus made his Defence : I had the Tankard it 's true ; but I know no more how I came by it than the Man in the Moon ; for I was drunk over Night , and next Morning I found myself asleep in S. James 's Park , with the Tankard in my Pocket . Guilty . Death .

The Prisoner went with us ; we rais 'd a Mobb in Chancery-Lane , and there the Prisoner pick 'd this Gentlewoman 's Pocket of a Gold Watch , which she after sold for 12 Guineas to two Jews that lived in Duke's-Place ; one of their Names is John Barnet , but I have forgot the other . The Prisoner has stole Watches out of all the Churches in London . She took my Lady Coventry 's Watch set with Diamonds , and my Lady Rainbow 's , and a great many more . Her House is a Place of Entertainment for none but Whores and Thieves . Several of the Prisoner 's Neighbours gave her the Character of a civil Woman and that she kept an orderly House .

I took her in a few days after , and she confess 'd that she open 'd the Drawers with this Iron Skewer , and took the Money , and that Isabel James , who put her upon it , afterwards got Part of it from her . When I took Isabel James , she own 'd that she had 4 s. 6 d. of the Money . The Constable thus deposed : I examined Lydia where the Money was , and she said , she fell a-sleep in the Coach , and Sibby James and the Coachman got it from her , for they went in a Coach together to the Musick House in S. George 's Fields . She said she did the Fact by herself . By her Directions I found this Box with a Guinea in it , hid in her Bed at the Ax in Aldermanbury .

One Saturday Night they both went out ; and when they came in again , they told me they had been to rob an Orchard . I ask 'd them where the Apples were ?
