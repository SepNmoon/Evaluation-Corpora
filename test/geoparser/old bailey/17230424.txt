Her fourth Rib was broke in the vertebra of the Back , and the End had pressed the Pleura , and the Lungs . And being ask 'd , How he thought this might be done he said it might be done by stamping upon , or some such Violence , but could not believe that it was by the Wheel of a Waggon , because , if it had run over her Stomach it would not have broken so many of her Ribs , and there would have been the Impression of the Wheel ; and if a loaded Waggon , it must have broke her to Pieces almost , whereas there was no outward manifest Signs of any such Accident . And if a Waggon had run over her Breast length ways , it must also have broken the Collar Bone , which was whole , and in no part of the Body so much as the Scarf Skin broke . That if it had been done by the Stamping of an Horse on her Breast , where her Clothes were not , he was of Opinion , there would have been some sign of the Nails .

Henry Parsons the Surgeon , deposed much to the same Purpose with the former Evidence , adding , That both her Ancles and Wrists were black , as if they had been grasp 'd ; and , that it was his Opinion likewise , that she could not receive the Wounds , and breaking her Ribs , by being run over by a Waggon .

That there was a Bruise on her right Eye , and her Arms had Bruises , and the Backs of her Hands , as if they had been trod or kneeled upon , her Thighs full of Bruises as if from Kicks . Daniel Wright , the Overseer , depos 'd much to the same Purpose . These Persons having given their Evidence for the King , as to the Fact , the following Evidences were called as to their absconding . Hester Tims , Joseph Burkingham 's Mistress was examined , Whether he lay at home that Night the Fact was done ? who declared , He did not . And also , that George Smith and James Simpkin lodged in her House , and that neither of them lay at home that Night .

James Peck depos 'd , That he took George Smith and Joseph Buckingham , and the latter confess 'd , that he stood by while Smith lay with Anne Bristol , and that the two others kicked her on her side , and that afterwards they would have had him lain with her , and shov 'd him upon her , and she cry 'd out , They had kill 'd her , and that they had broke some of her Ribs ; and that they had carried her afterwards to the Sign Post at the Landlord 's House . And , that George Smith also owned , that he had lain with Anne Bristol .

Joseph Buckingham 's Examination was produc 'd and read in Court , wherein he confessed , that they were all in Company with Anne Bristol at the Red Lion ; and , that Smith lay with her upon the Green ; and , that Loyd kick 'd her because she would not let him lie with her . This being the Sum of the Evidence for the King , the Prisoners made the following Defence . Smith pleaded , That as they were going along near Smallberry Green , Anne Bristol said to him , G - d - n you , where are you going ? That they met a Woman , who told them , she had help 'd her our of a Ditch , and that she had dropp 'd half a Pound of Butter , and that she fell down in the High Way .

That he saw four Men on the other Side of the Team , and desir 'd them to take her away , but she swore she would not go : That the Men said to her several Times , You Bitch , let go the Horse , but she would not ; and she desir 'd him to take her Part , for those four Men wanted to lie with her ; that he told her , if she would let go the Horse he would take her Part as far as he could , but she still swore she would not let go .

The Prosecutor deposed , That the Prisoner came to his Shop on the 24th of September last in a very handsome Mourning Chariot , with a Footman behind it , and wanted a Sort of Lace called Spanish Point , for trimming for a Suit of Clothes ; but that being a Sort that they did not usually keep by them , he was to get it made for him . However , he fixed upon a parcel of Goods for present Use , those mentioned in the Indictment , which were carried home to his Lodgings in Queen 's Square , by the Name of Marmaduke Davenport , Esq ; That then the Prisoner wanted a great deal more , as much as would trim five Liveries , but could not then tell the Quantity , till he had seen his Tailor .

He admiring at that ; and being desirous to know something of his Character before he trusted him farther , went to the Lady , and enquir 'd the Character of Marmaduke Davenport , Esq ; But the Lady could not recollect that she knew any such Person . Upon which he told her it was very strange , since he had seen in his Lodgings the Collar for a Squirrel which he had sold her . He then describing the Prisoner 's Person , she knew him , and said his Name was Alexander Day , and that he was one of the greatest Bites and Sharpers of the Town . Whereupon he presently got Officers and arrested him , and got his gold Equipage again . Ralph Greathead deposed ; That the Prisoner 's Man came to him to enquire for a pair of good Horses ; he show 'd him a pair , and he brought the Prisoner to see them , who liked them , and asked the Price , which he having told him , he said it was reasonable enough . Then desir 'd that he would furnish him with a good Coachman , he having left his at his Country-seat ; would have a lusty Man , that his Coachman 's Livery might fit him : He procur 'd him a lusty Coachman , on whom his Livery being try 'd , was something too little ; upon which the Esquire pausing a little said , Well , I will send for my own Coachman out of the country ; but his Man Lewis saying they might be let out for a small Matter , he approv 'd the Motion , it was done , and having procur 'd the Chariot , he had the Coachman and Horses .

Upon which he thought it was pretty well , and he was satisfied . But after he had had the Horses about nine Days , he bid the Coachman drive to a Tavern in Red Lion Square ; he went into the Tavern , call 'd for half a Pint of Mountain , drank it up , told the People there were some Gentlemen appointed to sup there that Night , and he would be there again presently ; and going out at the other Door , and leaving his Wine unpaid for , went away , and left the Chariot and Horses , which having waited some time , and no Esquire coming , the Coachman brought home , and he heard no more of him till his being apprehended .

He was also indicted a fourth Time for defrauding George Kendrick of 25 Pounds of Congo Tea , and other Tea , to the Value of 26 l . The Prosecutor depos 'd , The Prisoner 's Man came to him for Samples , and afterwards brought Orders for the Goods mentioned , which he carried to the Prisoner 's Lodgings . That then he desir 'd to have a Quantity sent of another Sort of Tea , and then he would give Orders that his Steward should pay him ; but the 'Squire having remov 'd his Lodgings before he sent in the other Parcel of Tea he spoke for , he could never find the Steward to pay him for the first .

That being introduced to the Esquire by his Man , after some Discourse of Packs of Dogs , and other insignificant Affairs , the Esquire fell seriously upon the grand Affair , and desire 'd that he would send him such and such rich Silks to his Lodgings , that he might see them . But Mr. Hinchliff telling him he might see more Choice in his Shop , he consented to go , and took Mr. Hinchliff with him in his Chariot ; talking by the Way of Sir Marmaduke , and several other Persons of Consideration , and that he was going to be marry 'd to a Daughter of Counsellor Ward 's . That he was going to furnish a House in Town , and should want considerable Quantities of Goods he deals in , and being come to the Shop , fix 'd upon the Goods mentioned in the Indictment , and took them home with him in his Chariot , having look 'd upon rich Damasks for Bedding , Hangings , & c. to the Value of near 1000 l. That Mr. Hinchliff telling the Esquire , That Ladies us 'd to be thought the most capable of chusing such Things , be enquir 'd if he had no Lady of his Acquaintance to assist him . To which he reply 'd , Yes , the Lady Davenport his Kinswoman , and desir 'd the Silks might be sent to his Lodgings , and he would get her there to view them . That then he ( Mr. Hinchliff ) being desirous to have some Satisfaction concerning the Esquire , sent an Excuse for the Delay , while he sent to enquire at Counsellor Ward 's ; but was inform 'd , that the Counsellor had no Daughter going to be married , but that one Daughter had indeed already been married to one Mr. Davenport ( into whose Acquaintance he afterwards found the Prisoner had insinuated himself , accidentally meeting him at a Coffee House , and prevailed upon to call him Cousin , telling him , their Coats of Arms were both the same ) . This Account prevented him from sending the other great Quantity of Goods , and going to look after him about the former Parcel , he was elop 'd , and he could hear no more of him , till he was taken up at Clapham , on Suspicion of robbing the Bristol Mail .
