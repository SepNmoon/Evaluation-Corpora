The Proceedings were as follows , viz . Eleanor alias Allen Marsden , of Aldgate , was indicted for privately stealing , in the Shop of Edward Holloway , six Yards of Muslin , value 32 s. on the 9th of July last . William Ponds thus deposed : The Prisoner came into my Master 's Shop to cheapen Muslin . I shew 'd her several Pieces . She was very difficult . I saw her put a Piece under her Petticoat , and let her go out with it ; but I presently follow 'd , and took it upon her . The Prisoner thus defended herself : I went into Mr. Holloway 's Shop to buy 'ome Muslin-Wm . Ponds perceiving me to be an innocent Country Girl , he chuck 'd me under the Chin , and said , I was a pretty Creature , and ask 'd if I did not come out of Yorkshire . I told him yes ; and then he took me into the back Part of the Shop , and put his Hand under my Coats , and gave me the Muslin to have to do with me ; and because I would not let him , he charged me with this Robbery . Guilty value 10 d. Transportation . Susan Brockway and Mary Gardner , were indicted for privately stealing three Broad Pieces of Gold , from Joseph Richmond , on the 6th of July last . Joseph Richmond thus depos 'd : About Nine o'Clock on Sunday Night , the Prisoners pickt me up upon London-Bridge . I went with them to the Cross-Key Tavern upon Fish-street-Hill , and there we staid about an Hour . I agreed to give them a Crown apiece , to - to - , not to do them over , but for them to strip naked , and show me some Tricks . And to satisfy them that I had Money enough to be as good as my Word , I took three Broad Pieces and three Shillings out of my Pocket . Brockway said , as how she supposed it was not right Gold , and so she took a Piece to look upon it , whereas she said it was very good , and gave it me again ; and by and by she snatches all the Money out of my Hand , and put into her Bosom , and said , You shall never see it again . I 'll keep it , to learn you more Wit ; , that another time you may know an honest Woman a Whore ; and then Gardner ran round the Table to her , with a Design , as I supposed , to take the Money from her ; but I kept my Eye upon them all the while as well as I could , and rang the Bell ; and when the Drawer came in , I sent him for a Constable . The Drawer thus deposed : This Man and the Prisoners coming to our House , I shew 'd them into a Ground Room , opposite to the Bar ; where they had three Pints of Mountain : After which , upon hearing the Bell , I stept in , and Brockway presently threw down three Shillings , and said , There is your Money , Drawer ; but the Man said , he was robbed , and desired me to fetch a Constable , which I did . The Maid deposed , that she undress 'd the two Women , and search 'd them in every Part , but - but found no Money about them . The Prisoners then made their Defence : This Man took us to the Tavern , and offered us a Crown apiece to strip ourselves naked , and stew him Postures . He gave Mary Gardner Money to fetch a Penny-worth of Rods , for him to whip us a-cross the Room , and make us good Girls ; and then for us to whip him to make him a good Boy : But we told him it was neither a proper Time nor Place for any such thing , for it was Sunday Night , and others might over-look us in the Room we were in , tho ' the Curtains were drawn . He bid us look to it ; for it should be worse for us , if we would not do as he would have us ; and so he called the Drawer , and said , we had got his Money . The Jury acquitted them .

John Farnell thus deposed ; The Prisoner had been two Weeks my Servant ; and on the 11th of June last , she went out , ( when my Wife was at Market ) under Pretence of fetching some Scowering Oil . My Wife coming home , presently mist the Tankard ; and wondring the Maid carry 'd so long , she sent one to see for her ; but she was not to be found . This increased our Suspicion ; and upon farther Search , we mist the other Goods in the Indictment . We saw no more of her till the 10th of this Month , when she was taken at the Angel in Hammer Smith , with my Wife 's Stays upon her , and confess 'd the whole Charge , and where she had disposed of the Goods ; some of which we found according to her Direction ; but the Goldsmith to whom she said she sold the Tankard for 45 s. deny 'd that he ever had it .

I met the Prisoner in Fleetstreet , near Fetter-Lane . I had then thirteen Guineas in my Pocket ; she stopt me , whipt her Hand into my Breeches , and when she took it out again , I mist six Guineas : I called the Watch , who took her to the Watch-house . - She at first deny 'd she had it , and no body searched her ; but afterwards confess 'd it . The Constable thus deposed : My Watchman brought the Prosecutor , with the Prisoner and another Woman , before me . The Prosecutor said they had both pickt his Pocket ; but fix 'd the Charge upon the Prisoner . - ( She has been brought to our Watch house for a Street-Walker before now . ) - She deny 'd the Matter ; and I talk 'd of searching her ; but the Prosecutor said it would signify nothing , for he did not question but that she had convey 'd it away . That Morning we carry 'd her before my Lord Mayor ; after which , we went into the Vine in Bell-Court in Foster-Lane , and there she confess 'd that she had the Guineas in her Mouth all the time that she was in the Watch house . The Prisoner thus made her Defence : As I was going up Flower-de-Luce Court , I saw a Man and a Woman a jostling together against the Wall , and presently the Man said , You Bitch , you have pickt my Pocket ; and seeing me , he ran after me , and said I was a Confederate , and so let the other Woman go .

Samuel Street , was indicted for Assaulting , Ravishing , and against her Will , carnally knowing Elizabeth Harvison , Spinster , aged 17 Years , on the 2d of August . Rebecca Harvison thus deposed : I and this Child of mine being at a Neighbour 's House , in Church-Lane , near S. Giles 's Church , where the Prisoner lodges , he came in about Seven at Night , took the Child in his Arms , and fell a kissing her . The Child , you may see , is a Dwarf , and an Idiot ; and what makes the Misfortune the greater , she wants the Use of her Limbs so much , that she is forced to be carried like an Infant . We afterwards went to an Alehouse , where we left the Prisoner and the Child , and went a little farther : And when we came back , we heard that the Prisoner had taken the Child out with him ; but he soon brought her home again , and went away . Then I undress 'd her to put her to Bed , and found she was ruin 'd , bloody , in a frightful Condition , and , by all Circumstances , had been ravish 'd . The next day , the Prisoner confess 'd to me , that it was he that did it , but said he was sorry for it , and would make it up ; and beg 'd me not to send him to Newgate , for that would ruin him . In two or three Weeks after , we found that the Child had the Foul Disease . Elizabeth Saxby thus deposed : Mrs. Harvison and her Child Betty being at Supper at my House , the Prisoner ( who is my Lodger ) came in at the same time ; and from thence we all went to an Alehouse in Dudley 's Court , and my Husband carried the Child . We staid there a little while , and then my Husband and I and Mrs. Harvison went out together , and left the Prisoner and Betty . We return 'd in about half an Hour , and were told that he had taken the Child away with him . I went to look for them , and found them by the Wall of S. Giles 's Church-yard . The Child cried , and told me the Man had hurt her ; and he leaning his Head over her Neck , said , I did not hurt you , my Dear , did I ? A Midwife deposed , that upon Searching the Child , she found that a Man had entred her Body about three Inches , & c. Anne Hains thus deposed : The Night as the Child was brought to our House , in Dudley Court , I was called in to see her , she being indeed a sort of a strange Sight . They told me , I need not be afraid to look upon her , for her Limbs were as straight as mine ; and with that , one of 'em took up her Coats to let me see . I saw nothing that ail 'd her at that time , which was about half an Hour before the Prisoner carried her out ; but being called to look at her in a little while after he had brought her home , I found a great Alteration : Some Man had certainly abused her . The Watchman thus deposed : I went in the Morning to apprehend the Prisoner : He was then in Bed . He is a Plaisterer by Trade , and the Apron that he usually works in , was then lying upon the Table , and I saw it was all bloody . Sam . ( says I ) you must get up and go along with me . He got out of Bed , and I perceived his Shirt was bloody too . When I brought him to Mrs. Harvison , he laid his Hand upon her Shoulder , and said , I have ruined your Child , but I am sorry for it . - Brignal thus deposed : I was in Company with the Prisoner soon after the Child was injured . His Apron and Shirt was bloody . He confest that he did the Fact , and beg 'd me to go and make it up . What a Stomach you must have , says I , to meddle with that Idiot ? Why , I would have kiss 'd twenty Women , and twenty times twenty , before I would have had any thing to do with such a Creature . Says he , The Devil bewitcht me . Frances Lepine , Midwife , thus deposed : I search 'd the Child two Days after the Injury . I believe a Man had made use of her ; but I saw no Signs of the French Disease , nor did the Parts appear to be torn or swell 'd . Christiana Bolton , another Midwife , thus deposed : I examined the Child in two Weeks and two Days after the Hurt was received , and I believe there had been an Attempt , but no Penetration ; nor was there then any Symptom of a Foul Distemper . I made use of one Finger , and did not perceive that the Parts were much extended . Two Days after I came again , and then the Passage appeared to be made much wider ; and I found a Running upon her . - Cox , a Surgeon , in behalf of the Prisoner , thus deposed : Being inform 'd that the Child had received the Foul Disease , I search 'd the Prisoner very strictly in Newgate , on the 17th Day after the Fact was committed , and I found not the least Sign of his having had such a Distemper upon him . Now , I think , a Man could hardly be so perfectly cured in so short a time . I own there may be a Possibility of it , in a very slight Infection ; or if the Patient had been under Cure before , and was almost well , at the time that the Fact was committed . Upon the Whole , the Jury acquitted him of the Felony , and the Court immediately ordered that he should be indicted for a Misdemeanor , which was accordingly done . The Prisoner pleaded Not guilty , and will be try 'd next Sessions . Thomas Williams , was indicted for privately stealing a Pocket with a Suit of Headcloaths , a Handkerchief , and 2 s. & c . the Goods and Money of Dorothy Burkitt , June 16 . Guilty val . 10 d. Transportation . Ann Munford , was indicted for stealing an Apron , a Pair of Silk Stockings , and a Snuff Box , the Goods of John Trewicks , Aug 5 . John Trewicks thus deposed : Alexander Hill ( with whom I had a small Acquaintance ) brought the Prisoner a Visiting to my House one Sunday Night . While she was there , we mist a Snuff Box off the Tea-Table ; but thought it improper to take any Notice of it at that time . When the Company was gone . I and my Wife look 'd for it diligently , but all to no purpose . She came again in a few days , and then we lost a Pair of Silk Stocking off the Back of a Chair . This gave us a strong Suspicion , and therefore we invited her to Supper another time , on purpose to detect her . She came , and we before-hand had hung an Apron , a Handkerchief , and a Turn-over , upon the Back of a Chair . The Apron was presently mist ; we charged her with taking it : She deny 'd it stiffly , and we were resolved to search her . Mr. Hill and I went out of the Room , and left her to my Wife and two more young Women ; but first we desired the Prisoner and every one else to look narrowly all over the Parlour , to be satisfied that the Apron was not there ; which every one did . The Woman deposed , that the Prisoner stript herself to her Under-Petticoat ; and then told them , that her Modesty would not let her go any farther to expose her Nakedness ; but they not being satisfy 'd with such a Pretence , she lifted up her Petticoat and Smock together . They still insisted upon having the Petticoat quite off . Then she unty 'd it , and in stooping down they perceiv 'd her to throw something white under the Table : They took it up , and found it to be the Apron . The Prisoner in her Defence said , that it was all Spight ; and that Trewicks told her he 'd make it up , if she 'd either give him 30 s. or stand stark naked for a Week together at the seven Dials . She called up several Witnesses to speak in her Behalf , and the Prosecutor produced others against her . The Sum of their Evidence on both sides was , That she was a Gentlewoman of very good Repute , was industrious and careful in the Maintenance of her Family ; that she had often been entrusted with Goods and Money to a considerable Value , and always preserv 'd her Credit without Blemish : But that she was one of the greatest Lyars in Life , an idle , lazy , cheating , pilfering , drunken Puss ; that she had three Husbands ; and had in general the worst Character that could be given to a Woman .

We staid there about two Hours : She went away before me , and presently after I mist the Goods is out of my Pocket . I was woundy vex 'd to think what Account I should give to my Wife when I came home . But howsoever I came to this House again the next day , and made Enquiry after this Woman , and at last I found her . The Prisoner thus made her Defence : I met this Man , and he told me if I 'd go with him , he 'd give me a Pint of Twopenny . Why then , says I , let 's go to a House that I know , and so I shew 'd him the Way to the Rose and Crown , and there we went up Stairs into a Room by ourselves , and both got drunk together . He bid me Half a Crown to do so and so with me ; but I did not much care to let him . Why , indeed , my Dear , ( says he ) I ha n't got so much Silver about me ; but I 'll change a Guinea , and if you are afraid of not having the Money , you shall hold these Headcloaths the while for your own Security ; and so he pull 'd them out of his Pocket , and gave them me : But finding myself a little in for it , as the Saying is , I did not care for staying any longer , and so I went away without my Half-Crown .

Frances Field got out of the Coach , and left us somewhere about the Old-Baily ; and from thence we drove to Long-Lane , where I stopt the Coach , and leaving them in it , stept out to buy a Hat and a Pair of Breeches . I did not go out of Sight , before I mist my Gold , which was in a green Purse . I presently taxed them with it . They said , For God 's Sake , do n't make a Noise , for Frances Field has got it , and she 's gone to Islington , and there we found her . Ann Smith in particular told me , that while we were in the Coach together , she saw Frances Field put her Hand two or three times into my Fob , and at last pull out a green Purse with Gold in it . Thomas Squire thus deposed : I saw Ann Smith take a green Purse with Money in it out of the Prosecutor 's Pocket ; but they all being acquainted together , I said nothing , because I thought she was only in jest . The Prisoners in their Defence said , the Prosecutor had kept Company with Elizabeth Field three quarters of a Year ; that he 'd invited them all out , and pretended he 'd marry her .

John Davis thus deposed : Having a Writ for 20 l. at the Suit of Susanna Crosier against the Prisoner , who dwelt at at a Distiller 's the Corner of Mackett 's Court in Piccadilly , and the Deceased being my Assistant , I took him with me to the Oxford Arms Alehouse opposite to the Prisoner 's Lodgings , in order to execute this Writ . We had not been there long , before we perceived the Prisoner looking out of his Window up one Pair of Stairs ; and the Street-Door being open , I sent the Deceased over , and in a few Minutes follow 'd myself . When I came to the Stairs-Head , I found him pale and bloody ; I took him down , put him into . Coach , and by the Time we came to the End of Gerrard-street , he died , I perceiv 'd he had receiv 'd two Wounds with a Sword one in the Left side , and a deeper in the Right . I ask 'd the Prisoner how he could be so barbarous ? And he answer 'd , he would have kill 'd more of us if he could . John Smith thus deposed : I had a Warrant against the Prisoner at the Suit of Mrs. Clements for 30 l. and going to execute it , I met Mr. Davis , who I found waited for the same Man . I went to the George Alehouse at the Corner of Mackert's-Court , opposite to the House where the Prisoner lodged . But there being no Room there that commanded the Prisoner 's Chamber , I watched the Room of the Oxford Arms , where Davis and his Man were waiting ; not doubting , but when they saw an Opportunity of taking the Prisoner , I should see one of them come out , and then I intended to be before-hand with them . But however , Davis 's Man stept in before I was aware of him ; for the first Suspicion that I had of his being there , was my hearing a Pistol go off ; upon which I stept up : I found the Deceased bloody , and the Prisoner walking about in his Wastecoat and Slippers ; and perceiving him to have no Weapons in his Hand , I presently arrested him ; and in carrying him down Stairs , I met Mr. Davis , who assisted me to get him into the Coach . I asked him how he could kill the Men ? and whether his Door was broke open ? He said , the Door was not lock 'd ; but the Deceased coming in without knocking , he took him for a Thief ; and if I had been there , he would have serv 'd me in the same manner ; and ask 'd for what he was arrested ? I told him for 30 l. To which he answer 'd , that he thought it had been for 150 l. and if he had known as much before , he believ 'd this had never happen 'd . Mr. Moor the Surgeon deposed , that the Deceased had three Wounds ; but the only one that he believed mortal , was between the 5th and 6th Rib , and divided the Arteries . The Prisoner then made his Defence . Mary Souter thus deposed : I was Nurse to Capt . De le Gall 's Wife , who at that time was very ill , and in Expectation of wanting the Midwife 's Assistance . She was leaning upon the Captain 's Arm to support herself , and I was sweeping under the Bed , with my Back to the Door , when I heard a Noise at the Door , and presently it was forced open , ( for I had locked it but a few Minutes before . ) I turned about , and saw the Deceased in the Room . He asked , if Capt . De le Gall lived there ? The Captain ask 'd him , what he wanted ? The Deceased made no Answer , but stood learning upon his Cane , and looking about the Room . The Captain then told him he believ 'd he was a Rogue , and bade him be gone at his Peril ; but he not going , the Captain stept back to take up his Sword , and the Deceased ran up with his Cane in his Hand , struck the Captain , and said , G - D - ye , I 'll have ye . Then the Deceased closed with him , and threw him down in a Corner of the Room : They got up again ; a Pistol lay upon the Chest of Drawers ; both of them strove to take it up , and in the Struggle it went off ; but did no Harm , except burning the deceased 's Shirt . The Captain had his Sword in his Hand , the Deceased ran upon him , collar 'd him , dragg 'd him to the Door , and endeavour 'd to throw him down Stairs ; but they both fell , at the Stairs-Head , the Deceased being undermost . The Prisoner 's Son thus deposed : Our Chamber-Door was broke open , the Box of the Lock was almost forced off , and some of the Nails fell into the Room ; the Deceased came in and asked for Capt . De le Gall : My Pappa said , What do you want ? - Get you gone at your Peril . The Deceased made no Answer , but struck my Pappa with his Cane ; my Pappa retreated , and took his Sword off the Table ; the Deceased ran upon him , and swore , G - D - me , I 'll have you with me ; and so he collar 'd my Pappa , and threw him down ; and seeing a Pistol on the Drawers , the Deceased dragg 'd him thither , and endeavour 'd to take it up ; my Pappa strove to hinder him , and in the Struggle it went off . Then he hauled my Pappa to the Door , and they both fell down together . Two or three other Witnesses were produced , who gave an Account , that there was a Lock on the Door , and a Bolt in the Lock ; but that the Bolt was defective , and therefore the Door was usually kept lock 'd ; and that the Nails of the Lock were forced out , and found upon the Floor ; and that those Nails produced in Court were the same . It appearing to the Jury , that the Deceased was no Officer , that he had no Authority to execute the Process in the Absence of the Officer , that he never did declare or tell the Purpose of his coming , and that he struck and abus 'd the Prisoner , they found him guilty of Manslaughter .

She carry 'd me to her Room ; I went to Bed , and gave her a Shilling to fetch some Drink . I had 12 s. then left in my Tobacco-Box , which I put under my Pillow . She went out two or three times ; there was no persuading her to come to Bed to me , and so I got up again about Two o'Clock in the Morning , and feeling for my Box , it was gone . I charged her with taking it , and sent for a Constable . She deny 'd it at first , but afterwards own d that she had it , and that she gave part of it to a Soldier to stand by her . She offer 'd me Half a Crown to make it up . The Prisoner thus made her Defence : The Prosecutor desired me to help him to a Lodging : I brought him to my Landlady 's ; but she having no Bed to spare , he would go into mine . I desired him to get out ; but he said there was Room enough for him and me too : Whereupon I left him , and went and sat at a Neighbour 's House , in hopes he would be gone .

John Best thus deposed : I am Servant to the Duchess of Leedes . Between Nine and Ten at Night , as her Grace was at Supper in the Back-Parlour , ( at her House in Pall-mall ) I heard a little Noise in the Fore-Parlour , where I had left the Candle burning : I stept in and saw Cliff standing there . He presently got out of the Sash-Window , and I after him ; for the Sash was then thrown up ; but it was shut close but a little before . I cry 'd , Stop Thief ; and in pursuing him , this Cloak was taken up . Richard Jarvis thus deposed : I struck Cliff as he was running , and this Pewter Salt-Seller fell from him at the same time . I took it up , and he got from me ; but was quickly stopt by another . He was carry 'd before Justice Ellis , and there made a Confession , ( which was read in Court ) that himself and Price , and William Sparks , ( not yet taken ) having stole a Hat and a Coat out of an Alehouse , they went together to the Duchess of Leedes 's . They look 'd thro ' the Window next Pall-mall , and seeing a Candle in the Room , and no Person there , Price lifted up the Sash , and himself ( James Cliff ) went in and gave out some of the Goods to'em . It appear 'd the Price escaped at this time ; but upon this Confession , a Search was made after him , and in two or three Days he was apprehended . James Scot thus deposed : I took Price near Southampton-street about Nine at Night . He offer 'd me all the Money that he had to let him go , and said that he was not accessary any farther than in opening the Window ; but that none but Cliff went in . Benjamin Bealing , Constable , thus deposed : That in his own House , he heard Price say , that he was in Company with Cliff and Sparks at the Duchess of Leedes 's Window when they were consulting to rob the House ; but that he advised them to the contrary ; which they not approving left them . Henry Fidoe , the Beadle , deposed : That in Bealing 's House he heard Price say , that he was with the other two at the Window , but did not go into the House himself ; and also persuaded them against it . Cliff said nothing in his own Defence ; and Price no more than that he saw Cliff and Sparks at the Duchess 's Rails , and only spoke to them as he past by ; but did not know what they were about . The Jury found them both guilty . Death . Edward Stevens and Matth.ew Mollineux , were indicted for stealing 12 lb of Lead , the Goods of Edward Horseman , on the 1st of July . Acquitted .

Thomas Woldridge , of Holborn , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of Elizabeth Fell , on the 28th of June last , about the Hour of Twelve at Night , with an Intent to steal the Goods of the said Elizabeth Fell . Daniel Brooks , thus deposed : I am Servant to Mrs. Fell ; and my Lodging is in her Garret . I went up Stairs about Ten o'Clock at Night , made the Door of my Garret fast , and so went to Bed , and soon fell asleep . About Midnight ( as I afterward found it was ) I was waked by the creaking of my Chest , which stood by the Bed-Side . - Who 's there ? says I . - No body answer 'd . - I jumpt out of Bed , and laid hold of a Man . Who are ye ? says I ; but not a Word would he speak . - I beat him about as well as I could . He still remain 'd Silent , and made no Resistance . I was wondring at it , when , all on a sudden , he cut me across the Face with this Pocket Knife . The Stroke I believed was aim 'd at my Throat , but luckily mist it . The Blood ran into my Mouth , and almost strangled me . However , I held him fast , got to the Window , and called the Watch , who quickly came to my Assistance , being let in by some of the Family , whom the Disturbance had by this alarm 'd . When the Light came , I was surprized that the Man that had treated me thus , was the Prisoner ; for I knew him very well , he having , not long since , been a Fellow-Servant with me in this very House ; which makes me think that his not speaking , was for fear his Tongue should betray him . His Penknife was found hard by my Chest ; which , I fancy , he was feeling for when he made no Resistance ; but not finding it , I suppose he took the other ( that he cut me with ) out of his Pocket . Mary Crouch , thus deposed : I went with the Watchmen , according to the Prisoner 's Directions , to fetch his Hat and Wig , which he had left by the Common-Sewer that is betwixt our Warehouse ( as we call it ) and Workhouse ; and by that Means we discover 'd the Way by which he got into the House . Mrs. Fell 's Business is boiling of Tripe ; and in that Place called the Warehouse , we put Offal and odd Things of little Value . There is an open Place over the Door of this Warehouse , at which a Man may easily get in . There had been wooden Rails nail 'd across ; but I ca n't be sure whether they were broke down that Night as the Prisoner enter 'd , or any time before . This , however , I take to be the Place of his Entrance . Then going a cross the Common-Sewer , he comes to the Workhouse , which has two Folding-Doors ; and whether these were fasten 'd or not , I can not be certain . The next is the Kitchen-Door ; and this has a Light over it almost like the Warehouse Door ; at which we presume he enter 'd , by the greasy Marks of his Shooes upon the Dresser ; and that Grease is another Sign that he came thro ' the Warehouse . From the Kitchen he must go up Three Pair of Stairs to the Garret ; but how he got in at that Door , I can not tell . The Prisoner thus made his Defence : I ask 'd Brooks to let me lie with him that Night , and he told me I might if I would . I happen 'd to be in Company with some Friends at an Alehouse a pretty way off , and they kept me till Twelve at Night . I came directly from them to Mrs. Fell 's , and knock 'd at the Door , and Brooks himself came down and let me in . I was got a little in Drink , and some Words passing betwixt us , it occasion 'd a Quarrel . All this was positively contradicted by Brooks ; and he continued to assert , that he made his Garret fast about Ten o'Clock , just before he went to Bed , and knew nothing of its being open 'd again , till he found the Prisoner at his Chest . To which other Witnesses added , that they saw the Prisoner sauntring about Mr. Fell 's House , from the Time her Family went to Bed , till almost Midnight : Besides which , were repeated the Circumstances of his Hat and Wig , and the greasy Marks of a Man 's Shooes upon the Dresser .

And Elizabeth White was indicted for receiving the said Goods , knowing them to be stoln . Frances Sanders thus deposed : I keep a Shop in Church-Row , by Aldgate , but my Dwelling house is in another Place . I and my Daughter ( Sarah Nichols ) were called up about Midnight , and found my Shop broke open , and sixty Pair of Stockings taken away . Sarah Nichols deposed the same , and both swore to the Bundle of Stockings produced in Court , there still being their Marks upon them . Elizabeth Jones thus deposed : Elizabeth White offered me a Parcel of these Stockings to sell . She ask 'd me 4 s. a Pair , and presently fell to 2 s. and said , if I would give that , she would fetch the whole Bundle , and the Man that own 'd them . This made me believe that she did not come honestly by them ; and therefore I desired her to go for the rest , but to bring them as privately as she could . In the mean time I sent for a Constable ; but White , and the other Prisoner Grey , with a great Bundle of Stockings , were with me before him . In order to detain them till the Constable came , I made them tell over the Stockings , set down the Prices separately , and then cast them up . The Men 's he allow 'd at 2 s. Boys at 6 d. and Childrens at 3 d. At these Prices they came to 4 l. 16 s. in all . I told them they must abate the odd 16 s. but Grey said he could not afford it . You can if you will , says I . But who do they belong to ? Perhaps I may come into Trouble about them . There is no Fear of that , says Grey , the Goods are mine , and I will bear you Harmless . By this time , my Husband and the Constable came in . Grey look 'd very shy upon them , and whisper 'd me to take the Goods at my own Price , and let him go But we secured them both . Robert Smith deposed , that about Eleven o'Clock on Tuesday Night , he and Grey , and one Tisdale , broke open Mrs. Sanders 's Shop , and took away these Goods . Grey , in his Defence , said that he had the Stockings from Robert Smith .

Mary Rans thus deposed : On the 15th of June I went to Bed about Twelve , and left all my Doors and Windows fast . I was called up about four , and found my House broke open ; two Panes of Glass were taken out of the front Window , and six in the middle Windows , which had Shutters without Side and within ; but both were broke open , and the Goods in the Indictment taken away . Not long ago , John Everet came to my House , and told me , if I would apply to one John Bewle in New Prison , I might hear of my Goods again . I went : Bewle ask 'd me if I had lost such Goods , and could swear to them ; and then told me , that he had sold them to Susan Belcher . Sarah Lear thus deposed : About ten Weeks ago , I went to Bed about Eleven , and left all fast . I was called up again about Two , and found my House broke open , the middle Shutter taken down , and the Sash thrown up . I then lost this Quilt , a Hat , and Petticoat ; and recovered it again by the Means of Bewle , who directed John Everet and Quilt Arnold where to fetch it . John Hedges thus deposed : On the 26th of June , between Ten and Eleven at Night , I made all fast , and went to Bed ; and rising about Five next Morning , I found both the outer and inner Doors of my Cellar broke open ; and that several Shirts , Smocks , a Handkerchief , and other things , were lost out of a Tub of Water ; some of which I got again by the Instructions of Bewle . John Bewle thus deposed : I have known Jack Little about three Months : My first Acquaintance with him was by means of his Wife Betty , for I have known her longer . Jack , ( says she to me one Wednesday ) I know a young Fellow that wants a Companion to go a House-breaking with : Do ye , says I ? Why then I am his Man . Let me see him . She soon brought us together . We presently struck a Bargain , and broke open 2 or 3 Houses that very Night . On the Friday Night following , betwixt 11 and 12 , we entred the House of Mr. Rans , over against the Sugar-Loaf in Virginia-Street . I remember there was double Shutters to the Windows . I hoisted Jack Little upon my Shoulder ; he took out several Panes of Glass , and so opened the shutters , went in , and took out the Goods . There was two Gowns , a Velvet Scarf , several Dozens of Wig Cauls , and other things . About a Week after we broke open Mr. Dear 's House in Gravel-Lane about One in the Morning . We cut away with a Hatcher , the Runner so far , that one of the Shutters fell upon my Head , and had like to have killed me . We only took a Quilt , a Hat , and a Petticoat from thence ; for the Watch coming their Rounds , prevented us . The next Week we broke open Hedgers 's House about Midnight , and took , Linnen out of a Tub of Water . The Linnen , the Cauls ; and most of the other things we sold to Mother Belcher , who very well knew how we came by them . Belcher , in her Defence , deny d that she ever bought any thing of either Little or Bewle ; but said , that Bewle had own 'd that he sold those Goods to one Roger . In Answer to which . Bewle did not deny but that he had sold some things to Roper ; but insisted upon it , that he sold the greatest Part to the Prisoner Belcher . John Little , in his Defence , said , that he never had any Acquaintance with Bewle . But this was proved otherwise by Quilt Arnold and John Everet . Quilt Arnold thus deposed : While Bewle was in New-Prison , I and Everet found these two Pick-lock Keys upon him ; and he expecting to be made an Evidence against Little , desired us to go and take him in Ratcliff . Bewle 's Wife ( with a Child in her Arms ) went with us to set him . And as soon as we had taken him , he said , he was sorry that he did not kill Bewle 's Wife and Child , for his Life was gone , now Bewle was made an Evidence . John Everet thus deposed : When we took Little , he would fain have got away , but we brought him to New-Prison ; and as soon as he saw Bewle there , he ( the Prisoner ) said to him , I little thought , Jack Bewle , that you would have served me so . We took this Handkerchief upon Elizabeth Little 's Neck . It is that that was stoln from Mr. Hedges . Elizabeth Little , in her Defence said , that she had it from Bewles 's Wife .

John England was found Guilty . Transportation . But his Wife acting by the Consent , and under the Authority of her Husband , the Jury acquitted her . Anne Harrington , was indicted for stealing a Sheet , a Curtain , and a Pillowbier . Acquitted . Hester Gregory , Wife of John Gregory , and Hester Gregory , Spinster , of S. Mary Woolnoth , were indicted for a Conspiracy against John Cockerell , a Gentleman of 1400 l. per Ann . For that they ( together with John Smith ) did induce and persuade the said John Cockerell to marry Abigail Cole , a Person whom they pretended was a Lady that had an Estate of 1000 l. per Ann in Barbadoes ; when they well knew that she was a Person of ill Fame , and of no Fortune , to the great Disparagement of the said John Cockerell , to the great Discomposure of his Mind , and in order to lessen his Estate and Substance , & c . on the 6th of May last . John Cockerell deposed to this Effect : About the Middle of April last . I went to the House of Mrs. Eccleton in Lombard street , to speak with her Mother Mrs. Gregory , ( the Elder of the Defendants . ) My Business with her was to demand a Debt that was due to me . She told me , that she was then unprovided to answer my Demand ; but that however , she had something to propose to me that might be very much to my Advantage . - Sir , ( continued she ) are you disposed for Matrimony ? Do you want a good Wife with a great Fortune ? If you do , I can introduce you to a very agreeable young Lady that is lately come from Barbadoes . She has a vast Plantation there , with a Hundred Negroes upon it : Her Estate is worth 1000 or 1100 l. a Year . She likes England so well , that she 's resolved to live here and marry , if she can meet with a Gentleman of a suitable Fortune . Why , really Madam , ( says I ) provided Things are as you represent them , - I ca n't say that I have any Aversion to Marriage ; - I would willingly have an Heir . - But - a - Madam , - are you sure that this Lady is indeed worth so much as you speak of ? Am I sure , Sir ? ( says Mrs. Gregory again ) - Yes . I am sure ; I had it from Mr. Smith himself , and he manages all her Affairs . - You know Mr. Smith , he lives at my Cousin Tryon 's ; - He 's worth 300 l. a Year ; he lives in very good Credit ; and you ca n't think that such a Man as he would impose upon any body . This Discourse was only betwixt me and Mrs. Gregory . It ran very much in my Mind all that Night ; and next day I came to Mrs. Eccleton 's again , and then I found there not only Mrs. Gregory , but her Daughter Miss Gregory , ( the other Defendant ) and the aforesaid John Smith . Our chief Talk was upon the same Subject as before ; and Mr. Smith assured me , that what Mrs. Gregory had told me of this Lady 's Fortune , was all true . I was very desirous of coming into this pretended Lady 's Company , and beg 'd them to let me know when and where I should enjoy that Favour . They promis 'd to make Enquiry , and send me Word . We parted , and the next day , being Sunday , a Letter was brought me , ( as I suppose from Miss Gregory ) appointing me to come that evening to Mrs. Eales 's in Ely-Court in Holborn , where I might see this Berbadias Lady . I want accordingly . and found her drinking Tea with the two Defendants . She was dress 'd in a rich Brocade , with a Gold Watch and Diamond Pendants . The Conversation turn 'd up on this Lady 's Plantation Miss Gregory then said , ( as her Mother had said before ) that Mrs. Cole was worth at least 1000 l. a Year , and had 100 Negroes . I then mention 'd the Name of an Attorney of my Acquaintance , and ask 'd the Counterfeit Lady if she knew him ? No , Sir , says she , I ca n't say that I have any Personal Knowledge of the Gentleman , but I have heard of his Name . Then pray , Madam , ( says I ) how long may you have had this Plantation ? About three Years , Sir , said she , And , Dear Madam , if I may be so bold , how - a - might you at first come into the Possession of this Plantation ? - Why , Sir , ( say she ) it was left me by my own Brother . Of all my Relations , I have only one Sister living : She 's about 9 Years old ; - but such a poor sickly thing - My Uncle left her 1500 l. which will be mine if I survive her . With such like Discourse we pass 'd away the Time , till the Company broke up . Next Morning , I went to Miss Gregory , to enquire how the Lady liked me . O ! Mr. Cockerell , ( says she ) you are certainly the most fortunate Man living . - I believe , o'my Conscience , you have bewitched the Lady . - She 's so Charm 'd ! So Captivated ! - She no sooner saw you , than she felt your Power . There was something in you so engaging ! so irresistible ! that you immediately gain 'd a perfect Conquest . - Her Heart ! her Soul ! her Fortune ! all is yours ! - Look ye , Miss Gregory as to the Lady 's Heart , I am under no Apprehensions of being deceived ; but me . thinks the Report of her Fortune wants a little Confirmation . Well , says she , you are the strangest Man ! so incredulous ! - I thought Mr. Smith had satisfy 'd you : But if he that has the Management of all her Affairs can not , I do n't know how I should . Well ! I went to Mr. Smith to talk with him seriously about it . Sir , says I , let me beg you to be ingenuous , - Has Mrs. Cole really got so good a Fortune as is reported ? Why , I 'll tell you , Sir , says he , since you press me so closely ; she has not quite so much : Fame is apt to be a little extravagant ; Eighty Negroes is the outside , and her Annual Income is no more than between 7 and 800 l. Upon this Fall of at least 200 l. a Year , and 20 Negroes , I returns to Miss Gregory , and tells her of it . Laud ! says she , do n't you perceive the Trick ? 'T is all an Artifice of Mr. Smith : He designs to try for the Lady himself . She told me but this day , that he had really made some Tenders of Service to her ; and 'us no wonder then if he endeavours to lessen your Opinion of her . I know indeed that at present she prefers you to him , tho ' you are in the Sixty sixth Year of your Age ; but yet if she finds you neglect her , Mr. Smith may chance to supplant you . Therefore , if you design to pursue the Amour , be quick ! dispatch ! the sooner the better . Then I desired Miss Gregory to ask this Lady if she was willing to be marry 'd next day ; and she brought me Word , Yes : And Preparation was made accordingly . As we were going in the Coach , I said to the Sham Lady , Madam , - do n't deceive me ; - Have you really such a Plantation ? She told me she had . In short , we were marry 'd , went to Bed together at Night , and - a - I need say nothing about throwing the Stocking . The next day , after Dinner , I went out , and at my Return I found my Barbadian in Company with another Woman . I think , Sir , ( says this pretended Lady of mine ) that it 's now high time to undeciive you : - I do n't question but that you think you have marry 'd a rich Lady of Barbadoes ; when , indeed , you are quite mistaken . Mistaken ! ( says I in a great Surprize ) Why , pray Madam , what are ye ? I am now your Wife , says she ; but before you made me so I was Mrs. Eccleton 's Maid ; and this is my Mother , a good honest Woman , tho ' she keeps a Chandler 's Shop . Mercy on me ! says I , what have I done ? Done ? says she , Why you have marry 'd Abigail Cole . Away went I to Mrs. Gregory : I wonder , Madam , says I , how you could be guilty of so vile an Action , as thus to impose upon a Man that has always been your Friend ? What could induce you to so much Wickedness ? Lord , Mr. Cockerell , says she , what do you mean ? I believe you have got a very suitable Wife : she had no great Fortune indeed ; but she may save you one by her good Management : You had Money enough before ; you only wanted an Heir to enjoy it , and in due time she may bring you one . Thus far the Plaintiff . And in order to prove his Wife ( according to the Indictment ) to have been a Woman of Ill Fame , & c. his Counsel called Abigail Holms , who deposed , that Mrs. Cockerell had been Cook-Maid at Mr. Eccleton 's , and that her Father was a Soldier , and a Pensioner in Chelsea-College . To answer this , by proving her to be a Woman of a Vertuous Character , the Counsel for the Defendants call 'd Thomas Fog , who thus deposed : I live at Mr. Eccleton 's the Sadlers . The Morning after the Wedding , I heard Mr. Cockerell say to my Master , I am sure my Wife was a Maid . And then , ( says my Master ) I am sure that you have been dabbling . - As for the Management in bringing this Wedding about , I have heard Mrs. Gregory and the rest of our People say , that at first they only talked of it in a Banter , and little thought of bringing it to any thing ; but when they saw that Mr. Cockerell was so quickly in Love , they carried on the Jest , till he was married in Earnest . Mrs. Eccleton thus deposed , Mr.Cockerell has sworn that he came to my Mother on Account of a Debt ; I dont know that my Mother owes him a Shilling ; but I am sure that he came very Often upon another Account . I believe I may safely swear , that he had teiz 'd my Mother 500 times to help him to a Wife : I myself have recommended him to at least 20 Women , all whom he left when he found their fortunes fell short of his Expectation . He was so continually importuning us to introduce him to Ladies , that at last we contrived to get rid of him , by dressing up my Maid in a young Lady 's Apparel , and recommending her to him for a Barbadoes fortune , and the Plot succeeded beyond Expectation . I believe she 's as modest a Woman as ever lived : Nor is she any thing below him , on account of her Father 's being a Soldier , for his Father served in the same Quality under Oliver Cromwell . The Monday after his Wedding , he came to me , and told me he was Bit . Bit ? says I , What a Man or your Years , and so well acquainted with the Town too ? 'T is very strange ! Well , says he , 't was my own Fault , I was a rash Old Fool ; I can blame nobody but myself . But I should have bit her , if she had been so Rich as I expected ; for I have made over all my Estate to my Brother 's Son , except 130 l. a Year , a Third of which is all that she can come in for , I ca n't tell whether he did this before Marriage or since ; but he desired both me and my Sister ( the Defendant ) to persuade his Wife to consent to a Divorce , upon Condition of his allowing her a handsome Reward . I told him I thought no Woman would be so much a Fool , as to swear herself to be a Whore , and so to lose her Husband for a little Money . Sh o , says he , there is no occasion for all that . I can manage it a much better way , if you can but get her to comply ; I 'll provide a Pre-Contracts betwixt me and another Lady , and get Witnesses to swear it . Anne Tea thus depos 'd : Mr. Cockerell , after the Wedding , came to my Mistress Eccleton 's , appear 'd very well pleas 'd , and ask 'd for Mrs. Gregory ; but as soon as she came to him , he charg 'd a Constable with her . She desired a little time to dress herself ; but he took her by the Shoulders , and would have thrown her down Stairs , if he had not been prevented . - heard him say , that the Reason why he was in such a Hurry to be married , without making any farther enquiry about the Woman 's Estate , was , for fear she should Enquire after his Estate and his Character . Mr. Singleton thus deposed : On Thursday Morning , which was the Wedding-Day , Mr. Cockerell telling me what a great Fortune he was going to marry , I bid him take Care that he was not bit . Bit ! says he , No no , I 'm too old for that , they must have good Luck that can bite me . And are you really certain , says I , as to the Money : Ay , ay ( says he ) I am very well satisfied . Mr. Hammond deposed , that after the Wedding , Mr. Cockerell told him he was very well satisfied with his Bride . The Court having summ 'd up the Evidence , and the Pleading of the Counsel on both sides , ( the last of which we have not Room to insert ) observed to the Jury , that the Marriage Vow of the Plaintiff over-turn 'd the whole Indictment , for in that he had acknowledged , that he did not depend upon the Report of her Fortune , when in a most solemn manner he protest that he took her for Richer for Poorer . - That he took her ( not for the Sake of a Barbadoes Plantation ) but to live with her after God 's Ordinance ; that is , for the Procreation of Children , and for the mutual Society and Help of each other . The Jury acquitted the Defendants . George English , ( a Boy ) was indicted for stealing 25 Bobbins , and 60 lb . of Silk , val . 5 l. the Goods of John Partan , in the House of Stephen Sydenham ; and Elizabeth English , ( his Mother ) for receiving the same , knowing them to be stolen .

Then the Prisoner offered to bear me Company ; and he appearing to be the civiler Man , I was willing to let him . Will . West followed us ; and when we came to a private Place , he threw me down and committed a Rape upon me ; and as soon as he got off , the Prisoner came on and ravished me again .

I was asham 'd to tell my Mistress of it ; but two Nights after I got her Sister Ann Tunstall to lie with me , and then I told her . Ann Tunstall thus deposed : Amy told me that the Prisoner had ravish 'd her , and put her to a great deal of Pain all the while ; but she never shew 'd me the Place where he hurt her . - And he 's as likely to do it as any body I know , for he had like to have ravish 'd me once since he serv 'd her so ; for truly , what does he do but comes into the Kitchen , and would needs kiss me Nolus bolus ; and then , Sir , he stoops down , pretending to buckle his Shoo , and whips his Hand under my Petticoats ; and if somebody had not come in , I do n't know but he might have got his Will . And then he had such Tricks of throwing Water up a body 's Coats , that there was no being at quiet for him . Several Gentlemen appeared in the Prisoner 's Behalf , who deposed , that they had known him for 6 or 7 Years past , in which time he was Clerk and Deputy-Comptroller at the Salt Office ; that he always bore a very good Character and they never knew him guilty of any immodest Behaviour .
