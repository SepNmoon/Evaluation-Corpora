READER , Wherein canst thou more experience they self for the ordering of a good Conversation , than by seeing the follies of those , who either by their own idle or extravagant living are forced to seek out those ways and means , which either are destructive in themselves , or purchase shame and destruction in their end ? The first thing I shall shew thee is about a Robbery on the High-way , Committed by two High-way-Men , the Manner was thus , one Stutely an elderly man going from market about five of the Clock in the Evening , near Hide-Park , was set upon by two High-way-Men , who bid him deliver his Purse he thereupon put his hand in his Pockets and pulled out some small money , and some farthings , and told them that was all he had , thereupon they began to swear God dam them , they would make him an Example ; then putting his hand in his other Pocket , pulled out about four pound , which they took from him , and going their way , a Neighbour of the said Mr. Stutely coming by followed them crying Thieves and with other help one of them was taken , who then confessed the Robbery , and offerred to restore the money , but they refusing to take it , he was had before a Justice of Peace , who committed him to Newgate and from thence he was brought to Justice-Hall in the Old-Baily to be Tryed , where the Prisoner being brought to the Bar , his Indictment being read , he pleaded not Guilty ; but there being such good Evidence brought against him , the Jury went out and brought in their Verdict against him , whereupon the Court past sentence upon him . Also there was another Tryed for stealing of a Looking-Glass from one Oliver Smith , the manner was thus , there did a great Looking-Glass stand in the window of the said Mr. Smith , valued at nineteen shillings , and he one Evening hearing a crackling of the Glass of the Window , went to look to see what the matter was , but could see no person , presently after going again , he found the Glass gon , and the Thief running away , who immediately following him , and crying stop Thief , he threw down the Glass , and in making hast away dropt of his Hat , crying himself , stop Thief ; but being most suspected himself , he was taken and his Hat carried to him , which he owned ; and Committed to Newgate , and from thence to Justice-Hall , where his Indictment being read , he pleaded not Guilty , but the Evidence coming against him , he was found guilty by the Jury and had Judgement to be hanged , being burnt in the hand before . There were three others tryed for breaking the House of one Mr. Bradbourn , in the night time , in the Parish of St. Giles in the Fields , having broke open five or six Dores , and stole some Silver Spoons , but being heard in the House by a Boy in Bed , who Rung a little Bell , awakened Mr. Bradbourn and his Family , and then they made away into Soho Fields , where the Watch following them , one of them was taken , and a great Iron Engine , which they called a BETTY , was found by him that was taken , and the same Morning 2 more of them were taken , being traced from one place to another till they were all taken , and Commited to Newgate , and from thence they were brought to Justice Hall , where theirIndictments being Read , they pleaded not Guilty : but the Evidence proving it against them , the Jury found them Guilty , whereupon Sentence was past upon them . There was a French Man also tryed for a Rape ; pretended to be Committed on his Maid-Servant , upon the Tryal she gave Evidence that she was one Morning about her business , and her Master arose and as she said took her Virginity from her , being askt what she meant by that , she answered her Maidenhead ; but it appearing to the Court , that she had not acquainted any one of it till three days after it was pretended to be done , nor had not accused her Master for it till above three weeks after , he was found not Guilty , and so acquitted . There was also a Woman tryed for stealing a Silver Cup , the manner thus ; she went to a Victualling House to drink a pot of Ale , and after having tarried some time , she desired the Woman of the House to lend her a Chamber pot , which she going to fetch it for her , she ran away with a Silver Cup that then stood on a Shelf in the Kitchen , and afterwards being taken by the Watch a night-walking , she was carried to Bridewell , where the Cup was found under her Arm , between her Arm and her Wastcoat , which she confessing where she stole it was sent to Newgate , and from thence to Justice-Hall in the Old-Baily , where being Arraigned , she was examined by the Court what she did intend to do with the Cup to which she answered , that she did intend to bring it again , whereupon she was Convicted , and put by to be transported . Also there was another person tryed for breaking the House of one Walter Carey , Esq . a Gentleman of Huntington-Shires , who being taken here in Town on some other account , was sent to the Round-house in Lincoln-Inn Fields , where Captain Richardson , keeper of Newgate , hearing of him , and going to him caused his Chamber to be searched wherein was found a Silver Toothpick Case , and Gold Toothpicker which were now owned by the said Gentleman of Huntington-Shire , insomuch , that the said Esquire Carey , coming to visit him in Prison before his Tryal ; desired to know of him whether he was the person or not ; which took him by the hand as he lay in his Bed , or not ; which he very confidently denyed , and said that he knew nothing of it : then the Gentleman desired him to give him his Left hand , ( which he did ) and having taken him by the hand : he told him in this manner ; that he would make Oath that that was the hand which held him by the hand as he lay in his bed , when he held a Pistol in the other hand to his brest , and swore that he would Pistol him if he did offer to stir ; and in the mean time caused his Lady to to rise out of her Bed to shew the rest of his Comrades where the mony lay ; all which , was proved against him at the Sessions House by one Mrs. Slader , Wife to James Slader one of the five Highway-Men , that were taken at Hampstead , being one of the Company then present ; upon his Confession before his Death to her and therefore brought in as an Evidence besides other Evidences against him , although he pleaded not Guilty to his Indictment , he was brought in Guilty by the Jury , and so he received Sentence . There was two others for breaking the House of the Duke of Buckingham , and stealing a great deal of Plate to the value of 400 pounds who being brought to the Bar ; their Indictments being Read ; one of them Pleaded not Guilty , and the other would not Plead , upon pretence that the Constable had taken from him eight pieces of Gold that was his own money , and so stood for the first two days ; whereupon the Court was pleased to read the Statute to him , declaring the punishment which ought to be inflicted upon all such persons that would not plead to their Indictments by Pressing ; and he hearing such grievous pu- there prescribed the next day pleaded to his Indictment not Guilty : but the Evidence proving it so clearly against them the Jury brought them in both Guilty : and Sentence was past upon them .
