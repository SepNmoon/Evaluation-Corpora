Between five and six that Morning as I was in a Brandy Shop in St. Martin 's Court in the Strand , the Prisoner and Sue Day said they 'd take a Dram with me at my House . With all my Heart , says I , and so I goes and knocks my Wife up . But she having no Liquor . I fetch 'd a Quart , and then went to Bed and slept 'till she waked me , and said , that they having no Money to pay the Reckoning , she had pawn 'd a Laced Waistcoat for the Prisoner , but was afraid it was stole , because they two had been a quarrelling , and charged one another with the Robbery . So I abused my Wife - Prisoner . Your Wife ? Ye Rascal ! What is Mrs Wileman your Wife ? She hanged a Man two Sessions ago - Every body knows Moll Wileman . E Hays . And what made me suspect the Prisoner the more , was , that she had got a Silver Hilted Sword with a Blue Belt , and she pull 'd up her Coats and buckled it on next to her Smock - So after she was gone I went in pursuit of her , and finding her in a Night Cellar at Charing Cross , I desired her to fetch the Waistcoat out of pawn , for it being pawn 'd in my Name I might come into a scrape about it . But instead of that she abused me . Then I left her and met Tom Day - Sue Minion goes for Tom 's Wife - and Tom carried me to the Constable , who said the Gentleman would be easy and give no body any trouble if he could have his Things again . I goes to the Prisoner again , and asks her if she had made away with the Sword ; she said , No . Then she came up Stairs and took Coach to Cabbage Lane - I dogged her , and saw her housed . I went back to the Constable , and he and I fetch 'd the Waist-coat out of pawn , and then we went and took the Prisoner - but she had disposed of the Sword . Mary Hays alias Wileman . After my Husband went to bed , the Prisoner and Sue Day drank twelve or eighteen Penn'orth of Surfeit Water . The Prisoner shew 'd me this Laced Waistcoat , and desired me to pawn it , which I did , in Hemmings 's Row for thirteen Shillings , and gave the Money to her . Prisoner . You lye Mrs. Wileman ! You gave it to Sue Day who is one of your own Creatures . Mary Hays . Then the Prisoner sent me for a Pot of Beer , and when I returned they two were a bitching one another ; and says Sue Day , This Bitch and I have both been a-bed with a Man , and brought away his Waistcoat , and Sword , and Stockings . Well , says the Prisoner And I wish I had brought away his Coat and Breeches too . They were going to fight , and I awaked my Husband , who went for a Constable , but before he came back they were both gone . Prisoner . The Prosecutor wanted me to go to bed with him , but I said , No , not to the finest Man upon Earth . Then he gave his Sword to Sue Day to let him lie with her - Next Morning she told me he had made her a present of his Waistcoat as well as his Sword - The Stockings were in the Waistcoat Pocket , and them she gave me . We went to Wileman 's , where we got drunk and quarrelled , and thereupon she went into York Buildings , and fetch 'd Tom Day , and he charged me with the Robbery , but said , if I 'd give him a Guinea , he would make it up with the Gentleman ; because I refus 'd it , this has followed . Sue Murphey , who is a Prisoner below , will prove that he gave the Sword to Day . Susan Murphey . When the Prosecutor came , he said , he had no Money , but would send a Porter for some if they would oblige him . They asked him for a Pledge , he said he had often been tricked that way but was grown wiser . At last he said he would give his Sword to Sue Day , but that she should lay it in the Chair , and not carry it out of the Room So he put it into her Hand , not , I believe as a Present , but as a Pledge . He asked me to pawn it to my Landlady , who is a Pawn-broker , though she keeps a Brandy-shop . Prisoner . You are a vile notorious Woman Susan .

June 11 . Dr. Lancaster . On Wednesday the eleventh of last Month , at seven or eight Minutes past nine in the Evening , being in a Hackney Coach with Mr. Clark , in the King 's Road , between Blackland and Bloody-bridge , about twenty Yards from the Red-Lyon , the Prisoner came gallopping up , and rid by the Coach unmasked , and bidding the Coachman stop , turned back with a Black Crape pulled over his Face , and holding a Pistol to my Breast , with many Oaths and Execrations he bid me deliver my Watch , Purse and Money . I gave him my Watch , some Foreign Pieces , and a Silver Tooth pick Case which was painted In the hurry I likewise gave him two Keys - I shall know them again - opens a Paper Parcel - This is one of them ; 't is the Key of my Bureau , I know it by this little Nick , and several Specks , for I have used it twenty or thirty times in a Day . The Lock has four Bolts , one of them was bent in breaking the Bureau open , so that it prevents the Key from turning so freely as it otherwise would . It might easily have been set to rights , but I thought in such a Case as this , it was not proper to make any Alterations - As to the Prisoner , I am sorry to say that I am positive he is the Man . Mr. Clark . I was robbed at the same time , but I can not say that I have any knowledge of the Person ; but whoever it was , when he came up the Coach , I said , Fellow what dost want ? G - d - your B - , says he , Your Money - If that 's the Case , says I , You shall have it . I put two Keys of an Escritore into his Hat - These two Keys I believe are the same that I then left . Dr. Lancaster . Perhaps I may be reflected on for being so positive to the Prisoner , when Mr. Clark declares that he has no knowledge of him , and therefore I beg leave to be a little more particular - I sat backwards and Mr. Clark forwards . The Prisoner came galloping the same way as the Coach was going ; so that I saw his Face though Mr. Clark could not . Prisoner . I would ask his Reverence , when he first came to see me in Newgate , and I stood fetter 'd with others who were not fetter 'd , whether he did not say , This is the tallest Man but his Face was cover 'd then , and if it was cover 'd now , I should be more certain - Cover your Face - pull your Hat down to your Nose . Dr. Lancaster . They were in a dark Room , and I saw them only by the Light of Links which were held in an odd manner : But yet I never exprest any doubt of his being the Person ; nor did I fix upon him because he was fetter 'd , for I do n't know but that all that stood with him were fetter 'd . Mr. Edmonds . I went with the Doctor to Newgate . As soon as the Doctor cast his Eye upon the Prisoner , he said , That 's the Man . Prisoner . Was this the first or second time that the Doctor was there ? Dr. Lancaster . It was the first time - The second time I went I mentioned the Tooth pick Case , upon which I observed an alteration in the Prisoner 's Countenance , and the Tears came in his Eyes . Juryman . How soon did the Prisoner return , after he had past the Coach ? Dr. Lancaster . The time was so short that I have no name for it . Juryman . Instantly ? Dr. Lancaster . Yes ; in a Quarter of a Minute . Juryman . Was it so light that you could plainly see his Face ? Dr. Lancaster . Yes ; it was the longest Day in the Year - I set out from Mr. Stockwell 's at Little Chelsea at forty eight Minutes past eight . Mr. Atley I keep The Man in-the-Moon Tavern in White Chappel . The Prisoner came to my House on twelfth of June - and just before he was taken , he shifted his Cloaths in order to ride out - These are the Cloaths he pulled off , and as soon as he was apprehended , he desired me to take care of them . I found those very Keys in his Pocket which were just now produced and sworn to . The Doctor challenged one of them , and brought the Lock which he said it belonged to . Samuel Snelson , Headborough . Mr. Hammerton * charged me with the Prisoner , who was then in a dark Coat and Wig , and said , That 's the Man He struck a Pistol in my Face . I beat it down . He snapt another Pistol but it would not go off . We took these two Pistols , these two Daggers , and this Great Knife . * Mr. Hammerton was robbed of a Silver Watch and thirteen Shillings near Barnes Common in Surry . In St. Paul 's Church Yard , he saw a Boy riding one Horse and leading another , and follow 'd them to the Nag 's Head opposite to the Man-in-the-moon in White Chappel . Mr. Hammerton waited to see who would come to take Horse . In a little time , Mac Cray came in a Laced Suit , and went into The Man-in-the-moon . Mr. Hammerton knowing him sent for a Constable . Prisoner . I do not deny that I had those Arms , and I had reason enough to carry them about me , for I was employed by some Members of Parliament to go down to Sudbury in Suffolk to serve Subpoena 's on account of some contested Elections ; and this being a Party-business , procured me such Enemies that my Life has been ever since in danger - They got a Woman in Suffolk to swear a Rape against me + . As to the Robbery now sworn , I shall prove where I was when it was committed , and how the Keys came into my possession . + He stands indicted at St. Edmond 's Bury for ravishing Martha Porter , Spinster ; and on three other Indictments . for assaulting , & c. Council . We fear some bad Practices , and therefore pray that his Witnesses may be examined apart . Court . Let it be so . Gilbert Campbell ++ , Attorney . On Wednesday the eleventh of June about six in the Evening , I met the Prisoner in Holbourn . I told him I was going to the Stag and Hounds ( an Ale-house in Holbourn ) with Mr. Ruffhead , a Client of mine , and I should be glad of his Company . ++ Campbell was an Evidence against Jack Smith , who was tryed in February last for stealing the Money of Nicholas Pollamounter . Sessions Paper , Number 2 . Page 40 . Court . How came you to take him with you to hear your Client 's Business ? Campbell . It was no private Affair , and I thought he might assist me . Council . How long have you known the Prisoner ? Campbell . Three Years - I went down with him to Sudbury at the Election of Mr. Price and Mr. Stevens Council How come you to take notice of the Day of the Month when you met the Prisoner in Holbourn ? Campbell . It was a remarkable Day - The King 's Accession to the Crown . Council . What Dress was he in Campbell . The same Clothes as were now produced in Court - I have seen him in a much finer Dress . Council . What Business did he follow ? Campbell . He was Clerk to Mr. Obrien . Court . Do you think that a proper Dresss for a Man in such a Station ? would his Business as an Attorney 's Clerk maintain him in Apparel trim 'd with Gold and Silver ? Campbell . He was not a Clerk at that time , nor for a Year before - but he practiced for himself - He was concerned in Law Suits , and I believe sometimes discounted Notes . Court . You were telling what happened in June last , when I asked you what Business the Prisoner followed . Your Answer naturally refers to that time , and not to a Year or two before . But proceed . Campbell . The Prisoner and I went to the Stag and Hounds . sat and drank a Quartern or two of Gin . Ruffhead and Brown ( another of my Clients ) came to us . I did not expect Brown , and I do n't know how it happened that he came , but he no doubt will inform the Court - We settled the Accompts , drank three Three-Shilling Bowls of Punch , and staid there till eleven o'Clock ; and neither the Prisoner nor any other of us stir 'd out of the Room all that time , not so much as to make Water . Council . What Dress were you in ? Campbell . The same as now , except a lighter Bob Wig ( an old Brown Coat with Silver Thread Buttons . ) Ruffhead . I am a Butcher in Clare-market . I had received a Letter to meet Mr. Campbell on the eleventh of June at the Stag and Hounds about settling some S. S. Stock which was left me by my Father - I went thither between six and seven in the evening - No , I went first to his Lodging , and there I met Mr. Brown , and telling him whither I was going , he said he would go with me ; so we went and found him and the Prisoner in a back Room up one pair of Stairs - The Prisoner was in a Silver-button 'd Coat , I had never seen him before ; but after he was committed to Newgate , Mr. Campbell carried me to him to see if I knew him again . Mr. Campbell was in the same Dress as now . We had three Three-Shilling owls of Punch . Julian Brown . I do know de Presonaar , but I see him no more as twice . Council . What Country man are you ?

How long have you talked English as you do now - Have you not sometime ago made use of an Interpreter ? Brown . Yes four or five Years ago . Mr. Deveil . That was when I committed him for a Street Robbery . * He pretended then he could speak no English at all ; and therefore I interpreted for him . I thought the Proof against him was very full , but he had the luck to be acquitted . * In September 1731 Julian Brown was indicted for robbing Rebecca White of her Pocket , & c. near Hungerford Market , and though he pretended that he could not speak a Word of English , the Prosecutrix and another Witness swore that he said very plainly D - your Blood ye Bitch , deliver your Money - She cry 'd stop Thief . He ran away , was immediately pursued , and taken in Covent Garden Church Porch ( where he had hid himself ) with the Pocket in his Hand . See the Sessions Paper , 1731 . Number 7 . Page 11 . Court How long have you been in England ? Brown . Ten Years . Council . Considering you could not learn a Word of English in the six first Years , you have made a pretty good Improvement in the four following - What Employment are you of ? Brown .

Vy mine Head vas full of de Law-Suits - I ave noting to do vid de Day of de Veek . Court . When was the Prisoner taken ? Mr. Hammerton . I took him on the twelfth of June , at about half an Hour past six in the Afternoon . Dr. Lancaster . And I went to see him in Newgate on Tuesday the seventeenth of June . Peter Chamberlain . I am a Butcher in Clare-market , and - Prisoner . Did not you meet me on Thursday Morning the twelfth of June near Charing Cross when I found the Keys ? Council . What do ye mean by putting Words into his Mouth ? Chamberlain . About eleven o'Clock on Thursday Morning the twelfth of June , I and Mr. Shirly ( a Barber in Stretton Grounds ) happened to meet the Prisoner by the Horse Guards , and coming by Charing Cross , I saw the Prisoner stoop down and take up three small Keys in a Bunch . Council . Are you sure they did not drop out of his Pocket ? Chamberlain . I did not see them before he took them up , and they were dirty . Council . Do you know how the Prisoner lived ? Chamberlain . A Year and a half ago , he was Clerk to Mr. Obrien - and since that I believe he might practice for himself - Besides he had good Friends in Ireland , and I suppose they sent him Money . Council . You were pretty well acquainted then ? Chamberlain . I have been several times in his Company . Council . About any Business ? Chamberlain . We only met to drink - My first Acquaintance with him was by an accidental Meeting at The Sun Tavern in Clare-market . Juryman . We should be glad if the Lock were rectify 'd , that we might the better judge if the Key belongs to it . Then a Lock Smith in Court Streightened the Bolt of the Lock , and tryed the Key again . Prisoner . You see the Key does not now do exactly . Lock-Smith . I believe this Key might belong to the Lock , but it is usual when a Key has been lost , and a new one made , to make some alteration in the Lock . Dr. Lancaster . There was no new Key made But this is the very Key that I lost ; and though I have opened the Lock with it twenty times a Day , yet I had often some difficulty to get it open , and I have turned it round four , five , or six times to double-lock it . Prisoner . Might not another Lock fit that Key ? Lock Smith . Yes , it is common - But as this Lock was broke off with Violence , that may have made some alteration in it ; besides , bending one of the Bolts . Prisoner . 'T is very Strange that his Reverence should be so positive to me , when he says he had only one side Glance of my Face late in the Evening . Dr. Lancaster . I said it was seven or eight Minutes past Nine , the longest Day in the Year , and I believe it was as light as it is now - But I remembered his Voice too - He did not seem willing to speak when I was first with him in Newgate ; but as soon as I heard him speak . I said I was as positive to his Voice as a Man could possibly be - Besides , I remember him by his Hand . Prisoner . My Hand ! I hope your Reverence wo n't swear to a Man 's Hand ? Court . Here is positive Evidence on both sides ; and as one is directly contradictory to the other , they can not possibly both be true , and consequently there can be no Medium , but one or the other must be perjur 'd . The Jury withdrew and after a short stay returned into Court , and desired that for their farther Satisfaction , the People at the Stag and Hounds might be sent for . A Messenger was immediately dispatch 'd , and brought the Man of the House and his Wife back with him . Mr. Forster . I keep the Stag and Hounds near The Three Cups in Holborn . Court . Do ye know the Prisoner ? Forster . I have seen him before . Court . Do ye remember to have seen him lately at your House ? Forster . I ca n't say that I have . Court . The Anniversary of the King 's Accession to the Crown was a remarkable Day , do you remember to have seen him then ? Forster . I ca n't say what Day . Court . Do you know Mr. Campbell ? Forster . Yes ; He was there that Evening from seven to eleven but I ca n't say that the Prisoner was . Its possible he might , and yet as I was busy among my Customers , I might not take notice of him . Mrs. Forster . Mr. Campbell was at our House that Day , but I do n't remember that I saw the Prisoner . Court . Has Campbell been there since ? Forster . Yes . Court . Did he then , or at any other time , apply to you about the Prisoners being there on the eleventh of June ? Forster No . Nor I never heard till now , that the Prisoner was taken for a Robery . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 23 . 24. , and Robert Kift , were indicted ( with George Vaugham not yet taken ) for assaulting William Stamper on the Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Hat , value 20 s. a Wig , value 6 l. a Gold Ring with a Stone . value 4 l. a Silver Watch , value 4 l. 4 s. a pair of Silver Buckles , value 17. s 6 d. and two Guineas , and 2 s. 6 d . May 13 . They were a second time indicted for breaking and entring the House of Jasper Stapleton , and stealing the Goods of several Persons , May 27 . in the Night . First Indictment . William Stamper . On Tuesday , May the thirteenth about nine at Night , I was attack 'd by four Men at Stone-bridge , just behind the Watch-house , between Shoreditch Church and Kingsland . One of them took me by the Coat and said , D - your Blood come along or I 'll blow your Brains out . R - ( who was another of them ) said to me , Be quiet , and nobody shall hurt your Body . They carried me about one Hundred Yards down the Lane where Jack Catch was hang 'd . They took from me two Guineas and half a Crown , my Hat and Wig , a Silver Watch , an Amethyst Ring with my Coat of Arms on it , and my Silver Buckles out of my Shoes . They cut the String of my Breeches and tyed my Hands behind me , and one of my Legs . I desired them not to throw me down , because I had lately broke my Arm . So they laid me down gently . R - said , Be easy , and one shall come in five Minutes and release you ; and if any body else offers to meddle with you , say that you have spoke with Mr. Jones . I suppose that was a Watch Word , but I told him it could do me but little service after I had been rob 'd of all . He said I need not complain , for if he should be taken I would have no mercy on him . So he fired a Pistol over my Head ( which I thought was a silly Action ) and then they left me - I believe that tall ill-looking Fellow , the other Prisoner , was another of the Gang , but his Face was muffled - One of them had a long Knife like that as was taken upon Mac Cray . And R - gave two Pistols to the other two - This is my Wigg , it was taken upon R - Head - I lay bound in the Lane an Hour by St. Paul 's Clock , and then I made shift to get loose . John Cotterel . I have been engaged with the Prisoners about six Weeks . On the thirteenth of May in the Evening , They and I and George Vaughan went to The Fox Alehouse in Kingsland Road , where we staid till it was duskish and then went out together and met with the Prosecutor at Stone Bridge . R - presented a Pistol and demanded his Money , and Vaughan gave him a Punch in the Face . They also took his Hat , Wig , Ring and Money and I took the Buckles out of his Shoes . He said he had lost two Guineas , and a half Crown . But we went from thence to The Magpye Tavern at Bishop 's Gate to share the Booty , and then they produced only a half Crown and two half Pence , and said , the Gentleman was a lying Rogue for saying that he had lost two Guineas . Next Day Vaughan and R - - disposed of the Watch for a Guinea and a half , as they told me , and then they knock 'd the Coat of Arms out of the Ring and sold the Gold for four Shillings six Pence , five Shillings six Pence , or six Shillings six pence , I ca n't say which , but there was an odd six Pence ) to a Gold-Smith in White Chapple - and the Buckles . - Kist . Talk to my Lord , and do n't stand -playing with your Hat - such a Rogue as you , will swear any thing . Cotterel . R - carried the Wig to Phillip Lacy a Barber in Petticoat Lane ( White Chapple ) to see what it was worth . Lacy look 'd on it and said , This Part is Goat 's Hair - This is Mohair - and this is the Devil - By G - the Wig is worth but sixteen Shillings . We threw for the Wig with Box and Dice , and R - had it - I afterwards asked Lacy how he came to value such a Wig at but sixteen Shillings , and his Answer was , D - R - , bid me say so - Before we left the Prosecutor , R - fired a Pistol over his Head , and told him that was a token for one to come and relieve him , but we knew of nobody that was to come on any such Account . R - I bought the Wig of Cotterel . Phillip Lacy . R - and Cotterel brought the Wig to me in the Dusk of the Evening , and it was then much rumpled , so that I could not well judge of the Value of it - But afterwards I said it was once worth seven or eight Pound . R - Here is my Landlord , with whom I lodg 'd a Quarter of a Year last past , and he can prove that I was never out of his House after eight at Night . Thomas Williamson . The Prisoner never lived with me , but he offered me Money to swear that he lodged at my House ever since the fourth of last April - and to swear that I saw him give half a Crown a piece to Kist and Cotterel for their shares of the Wig . R - You may see by his Face that he swears falsely . Court . He 's your own Witness . Kist . As to that Rogue Cotterel , his own Rod will whip him - And as to my dying before him , it will be a pleasure to me , and I am only sorry that it should be by the Evidence of such a Villain - But he 'll come to it in a little while . The Jury found the Prisoners Guilty . Death . There appearing some favourable Circumstances in the Case of R - the Jury recommended him to Mercy . 25. Abraham Austin , was indicted for stealing a Silver Spoon , value 4 s. the Goods of Stamp Brookshank , Esq ; and a Pair of Clogs , value 2 s. the Goods of Hester Fletcher , June 18 . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 26. Edward Omsby , was indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , value 8 l. the Goods of Richard Lilly , in his House , June 20 . And 27 . 28. Martha Shelton alias Strutton , and Patrick Branan , were indicted for afterwards receiving the same , knowing it to be stolen . Mary Lilly . On the twentieth of June about three in the Afternoon , the Prisoner Omsby came to my House in Denmark Street , Ratcliff Highway and call 'd for a Pint of Beer . I went to draw it , and when I came up again the Prisoner was gone . I look 'd in my Cup-board on the Stairs , and mist my Tankard . I enquired of some People at the Door if they saw such a Man , and I was told that he ran down the Street - I had put the Tankard in that Cup-board my self , but a quarter of an Hour before I mist it , and no body had within that time been in the House but the Prisoner . Prisoner . How do ye know who came in when you were in the Cellar ? How long had I been in your House ? M. Lilly . About half an Hour . Richard Lilly . I went out about three , and left Omsby in the House . When I returned there was an Oration about the Tankard being lost , and my Girl said that the People said that the Prisoner went down the Street stradling as if he had got the Pox - I advertised the Tankard , and heard of it from a Pawnbroker - I am a Taylor by Trade , and the Tankard stood by me on the Shop-board till near three o'Clock , and I left it there when I went out - Omsby had been at my House six or seven times before , and I knew no harm of him till this happened . Richard Smitherman , Pawnbroker . I have known the Prisoner Martha Strutton these ten Years and ca n't say that I know any harm of her . On the twentieth of June between nine and ten at night , she brought this Tankard to my Shop in Eagle Street in Holbourn to pledge for four Guineas , I asked her who it belonged to . She said to an Ale-house-keeper at The Fountain in Tothill Street Westminster . I told her I would send my Servant thither with the Money . You need not do that , says she , for the Man is at the Door ; and so she called in the Prisoner Omsby . I took him aside , and while I was talking with him , she took up the Tankard and carried it out to a Man who run away with it . I cryed stop Thief , and followed him into Little Queen Street where he was taken . This was the Prisoner Branan . I enquired for the Tankard , and heard that he had thrown it against a Barber 's Door in the Street as he ran along , and that the Woman of the Barber 's Shop had pick 'd it up . Branan was carried before Sir John Gonson , and own 'd that he ran away with the Tankard . I had left Omsby in my shop , and he as I heard ran another way , but was taken again . Omsby . Did you see me handle the Tankard ? R Smitherman . No . Omsby Did I see the Tankard in your House ? R. Smitherman . You came in as the Owner , and desired to have five Guineas upon it , though the Woman had asked but for four Guineas . Omsby . Did not I come in to pawn a pair of Silver Buttons ? R. Smitherman . No . Omsby . There being some dispute between you and the Woman , I own that I desired you to let her have what she wanted - Was I in the same Box with the Woman ? R. Smitherman . No . Omsby . Why was I carried into a different Box ? R. Smitherman . She told me you did not care to be seen , and there being other People in the Shop I took you into a little Room . Martha Shelton . I have known Omsby about three Years , he brought this Tankard to me that Evening , and told me that he kept The Fountain Alehouse , but wanted to make up some Money for his Brewer . I had not seen him for two Years before , but believing him to be an honest Man , I carried the Tankard to pledge at a House where I was known . The Pawn-broker asking several Questions about it , Omsby said to me , Since he makes such a rent about it , bring me the Tankard again , for I can pawn it any where . So in a hurry , I catch 'd up the Tankard , and gave it to a Man at the Door . Branan . I know nothing of it I 'll give ye my Word . William Belt . and others deposed that they heard Omsby say , that the other two Prisoners were innocent . John Tozer . Being near the Pawn-brokers , I heard a cry of stop Thief , and Omsby running at the same time , I stopt him ; several Questions were asked him , but he was dull and would say nothing - He and the Woman were sent to New-Prison . Two or three Witnesses appeared in behalf of Strutton , and as many for Branan , and gave them good Characters . The Jury found Edward Omsby guilty . Death But acquitted the two Accessaries/ . 29 , 30.

But they being convicted on the former Indictments , it was not thought necessary to try them on this . [ Nightingale , Tippet , Winnington : Transportation . See summary . ] [ Elliot : Branding . See summary . ] 35. Joshua Dean , Callico Printer , was indicted for forging a Stamp , to resemble a certain Stamp , provided to stamp Vellum , Parchment , and Paper , chargeable by certain Statutes with the Duties of six Pence , six Pence , and six Pence , May 30 in the Parish of St. Mary le Bow , in London . Elihu Bridoak . I have known the Prisoner since 1733 - About the twenty sixth of July , 1734 . I by his Direction , purchased two Treble six Penny Stamps , from one of which he made a Counterfeit - He had told me before that he could make a Counterfeit so exact as not to be known from the true Stamp ; and if I would assist him I should have half the Profit . He then had a House in New street , Fetter-lane , which I hired by his Orders , with an intent only to Coin Money there - He melted a Composition of Metal in a Crucible , and so cast a counterfeit Stamp ; after which he repaired it fit for use , and then stampt near two Ream and a half of Paper . He made three Impressions on some Sheets , and but two on others - In March last , I went again by his Orders for two other Stamps , and these I carried to a Lodging in Paul 's Alley in Aldersgate-street , and there he cast another Stamp from one of these new ones and stampt several Papers . Council . The Stamps have usually some particular Letter on them - What Letters had those the Prisoner made ? Bridoak . The first was Y , and the second AA . But he made others . There was one twelve Penny Stamp among them . He had a House at Lambeth-marsh when we had the Lodgings in Paul 's Alley , and there was another House in St.George 's Fields , which was partly his , and partly Mr. Watts 's - When the Prisoner was in the New Goal in Southwark , he bid me go to his House at Lambeth-marsh , and fetch the Key of the House in St.George 's Fields , and carry away all his Implements that they might not be produced . But I gave Information to the Stamp Office . Mr Lunnies , the Messenger , came with me to this House in St. George 's Fields , where we found two Presses one for Coining , and one for Stamping , and several Dies for half Pence and Guineas . Thomas Lunnies . We found two Presses , one was fixt to a Block . On the Block we found two Dies for half Pence , a Head and a Britannia , and two more were in the Window . This Stamp and three more were found in a Tin Box , two for two Shillings and three Pence , one for twelve Pence , and one for six Pence , and several more were found under the Stairs . Bridoak . I was present when the Prisoner made this Stamp AA , and saw him stamp Paper with it . I saw him stamp this Paper in my Hand with the Letter Y . He made other Stamps with T and R. Thomas Hodson . I took these eight Stamps from between the Wall and the Stairs . Bridoak . Here are four six Penny Stamps , and I saw him make three of these ; Y , AA , and O , and one Penny Stamp . Mr. Rollos . I have engraved for the Stamp Office about thirty three Years . The Stamps now produced are Couterfeit ; ours in the Office are all of Steel , but these I believe are a composition of - and - I am sure this Paper was not stampt in the Office ; and I verily believe it was done with this counterfeit Stamp Y. Mr. Lunnies . This other Press is for stamping ; we found it up two pair of Stairs in the same House , it was not fixt to any thing , nor put together as that on the Block is - And this is the Fly of the Stamp Engine ; we found it at their Lodging in Paul 's Alley . John Boddington , Smith . This Screw and Box which belongs to this Press I made by Bridoak 's Order . After I had done it , he brought the Prisoner to me ; and the Prisoner gave me orders to make the Block that the Iron is fixt on . Council . What name did he call it by ? Boddington . He gave it no name , but he chalked out the Parts of it for my direction , and said it was to make Buckles and Buttons - It was found up two pair of Stairs in the House in St. George 's Fields . Council . We mention this , only to shew that that House where the Stamps were found , was made use of to hold the Prisoner 's Goods . Bridoak . Here 's the Instrument we used to Label the Parchment with , and these are the Prisoners Punches . Mr. Rollos . These Puncheons are to repair the Stamps after they are cast - This is to sink the Leaves of the Roses - These are Letters - This represents the Seed in the Rose of the six Penny Stamp - This by way of ornament round the Hoop of the Crown - This is for the end of a Leaf of the Rose within the Garrer - This , a Flower de Luce in the Imperial Crown - This the end of the inner Leaf of the Roses - And here is another Ornament for the Hoop of the Crown . Prisoner to Boddington . You say that I gave you Orders to make that Engine ; did I not tell you that it was not for my self ? J. Boddington . He said it was to go to Lancashire to make Buckles and Buttons . Prisoner . Did not an old Man come to examine it ? J. Boddington . Yes , one Watts . Prisoner . Here is Mr. Boddington 's Brother - Did you make any part of that Screw Press on the Block for Bridoak ? George Boddington . I do n't know that I made any of this for him , for this is Three Threads , but I made part of one of Two Threads for him . Council . Do you often make such things ? G Boddington . Yes , I have made several . Council . For what use ? G. Boddington . They may put it to what use they please , but they commonly say it is for Buckles and Buttons - Prisoner . Being told that Bridoak belong 'd to the Law , I employed him to get a little Money that was due to me . Thus our Acquantance begun . After this he told me he was going to set up one Watts to make Buckles and Buttons at Warrington in Lancashire , but did not care to trust Watts by himself ; and therefore if I would get a Press made , and assist in the management of this Affair , he would make it worth my while . So I employed Bridoak to dispose of my House , and I sent all the things into the Country - And when I was taken , I told Mr. Lunnies what Ship I sent my Goods in for Liverpool , that he might examine into the Truth of it . Mr. Lunnies . Yes you did . Prisoner . 'T is natural for a guilty Man when he is discovered , to throw the blame on another . This is what Bridoak has done by me - I shall prove that the Presses belonged to him - Call John Roach and George Wilden . John Roach . Bridoak hired me and Wilden to carry a thing in a Sack - I do n't know what it was , but it was very heavy - from a Stationer 's in Butcherhall Lane - and these two square Stones from the corner of New-Street , Fetter-lane , to White Fryer 's Stairs , where we put them into a Boat , and carryed them over to the Old Barge House , but I do not know what became of them afterwards . Wilden deposed to the same effect . Prisoner . These were all found in the House that belongs to Watts - Let them prove that it belong 'd to me - Call Mrs. Hollings . Mrs. Hollings . I keep the Hat and Feather on the Broad Wall at Lambeth . The Prisoner and Bridoak and Watts were several times at my House . Prisoner . Did not Bridoak make a Bargain with one Sharp for my House on the Broad Wall ? Mrs. Hollings . But Wattt came at last , and said , that he and not Sharp was to have your House . Prisoner . This is to shew that I employed Bridoak to dispose of my House when I was going into the Country - As for the House where the things were found , I say it belonged to Watts - Let them call the Landlord to prove whether it was Watts 's House or mine . John Green . As I was sitting at Mr. Wigly 's House at Lambeth marsh ( where the Prisoner lived ) I saw Bridoak going by , I called him and told him that in my opinion he would be taken up as well as the Prisoner . Prisoner . And thereupon to save himself he surrendered and informed against me - Who is there to prove any thing against me but he - And he owns himse ' f to be an Accomplice - Had I been concerned I should have got Money as well as he - But I was reduced to such streights , that I was forced to sell my Wig in the last Law-suit he managed for me . Council . Prove the Law-suit . Prisoner . So I will - Call Giles Bradshaw . Giles Bradshaw . Bridoak brought an Officer and arrested me at the Prisoner 's Suit - but I believe Bridoak was not an Attorney . Prisoner . Did not he act as a Solliciter ? G Bradshaw . I do n't know what a Solliciter is - But he received the Money of me and gave me a Receipt . John Wigly . I was the Prisoner 's Landlord in Lambeth Parish . At first he rented a House of me at five Pound a Year - Then he quitted it and let it Bridoak , and took a place that goes off the Broad Wall - Its a mighty promiscuous place , its a Hovel , and was a Hog 's Sty . Every Door is a Window and every Win- dow is a Door , and there is no looking into the Windows . There is a Garden before it , and a Ditch behind ; a mighty promiscuous place indeed . The Prisoner built it himself ( for he is a very good Workman , with all these Contrivances - This is not the House in St. George 's Fields Prisoner . What Contrivances , Doors , and Windows ? What is there particular in the House ? J. Wigly . There was a Forge . Mr. Rollos . A Furnace , and Crucibles , and Sand . J. Wigly . He cut Callico-prints , and made Buckles - I have often heard him pound . pound , pound-something or other ; and Bridoak often went backwards and forwards to him with something in a Flag Basket . He was to have had a Lease of this promiscuous ; place , but I not liking the Company that came after him ( a Woman they called Flora , Bridoak , Watt , and Boulter ) I refused . Upon which the Prisoner said he did not want the Lease for himself , but for old Watts - But Bridoak and Boulter threatned to sue me in Chancery . Prisoner . Call Benjamin Dell - Mr. Dell , is there any thing uncommon in that House ? B. Dell . I never saw any thing suspicious - Tis a slight House , has two or three little Rooms on the Ground Floor , and the upper part is a Lost - There is a Garden with a Gate before it , and a Field with a Ditch behind it - I have seen Buckles , and such things , and he cut Prints . I have been at his House Day after Day ; and I have often seen him at work upon his Prints , but never knew him do any base Action . Mr. Hains . I lived next Door to him . He was a civil Neighbour , and bore a very good Character . Prisoner . Could not you at any time come out of your Ground into mine ? Hains . Yes ; There is a Gap on purpose ; and the Door is only fastened by a single Bolt , and there is room for a Man to put his Hand in and push t back . Prisoner to Mr. Lunnies . Who is the Landlord of the House in St. George 's Fields . Mr. Lunnies I think his Name is Igby , by St. George 's Church . Prisoner . Did you ask him who was the Tenant ? Mr. Lunnies Old Watts was the Tenant . Prisoner . Very well ; and I would ask Mr. Bridoak , who took the House in New-street , and the Lodgings in Pauls Alley ? Bridoak . I did . Mrs . Petty . Bridoak hired a Room of me in Paul 's Alley , a Month before Lady-Day . I understood it was only for himself ; but afterwards the Prisoner came to lodge with him , and they cohabited together three or four Months . Prisoner . I lodged there only after I had sent my Goods into Lancshire - Call Mr. Herbert , who was Watts 's Landlord - Did not Bridoak come to your House to bid Watts keep out of the way ? Edward Herbert . Bridoak came to where I live ( at Mr. Williams , a Baker in David-street ) to ask if Watts lodged there . I said , Yes . What is your Business . Nothing , says he , but to leave a Direction . So he took this Paper out of his Pocket and left it for Watts - This was about three Weeks ago , and three Days after the Prisoner was taken up . Then the Note was read in these Words . Mr. Dean does not want to see you till he returns out of the Country . Prisoner . Do n't you apprehend that by my being in the Country he meant my being in Prison ? E. Herbert . I thought afterwards when I heard the Story , that his Design was to keep Watts out of the way . Florance Cameron . I asked Bridoak what he thought would come of this Affair of the Prisoners ; he said he could not tell , till the Trial was over . Do you know where old Watts is ? says I . No , says he , but sure he is got out of the way by now for I have left a Note for him - And if Dean had done as I bid him , he need not have been in Confinement , and might have had Money in his Pocket . Prisoner . Bridoak brought me some Patterns to cut Wooden-prints for Paper ; but there being some of them like Post Marks , and some with Crowns upon them , I refused to meddle with them . However there being one for Daffy 's Elixir I begun upon that , but shuffled off the finishing of it as long as I could , in hopes that by the time it was done he would make an end of the Law-suit I had employed him in that I might get a little Money that was due to me , and which was all I wanted for , before I went into the Country . The Jury acquitted him . 36. John Knight , was indicted for stealing two dead Ducks , the Goods of Stephen Dobbs , June 17 . Guilty 14 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 37.

Peter Warren , Esq ; was indicted for Wilfull and Corrupt Perjury , for that he , to aggrieve Edward Perkins , Esq ; and to discharge a Rule against James Brown for excessive Gaming , did on the twenty second Day of April , make an Affidavit in Writing before Mr Justice Lee in Serjeants Inn , in which Affidavit he denied that Edward Perkins did lose seven Hundred Guineas to James Brown at Put ; or that he the said Warren did look over the said Perkins 's Shoulder ; or went Partner with the said Brown ; or did receive of the said Perkins three Hundred and fifty Guineas for his part of the said seven Hundred Guineas ; Whereas in Truth and in Fact , & c . But no Evidence appearing , the Jury Acquitted him . 45. Thomas Charlesworth , was indicted for a Misdemeanor in extorting a Note from - Constable . But no Evidence appearing he was Acquitted . 46 John Dun , was indicted for stealing two Silver Tankards , value 28 l. the Goods of Phillip Shirly , in his House , June 29 . Mr. Shirly . I keep The Hoop and Bunch of Grapes Tavern facing Beauford 's Building , in the Strand . Last Sunday about five or six Minutes before ten at Night , two Men came up the Passage into my Yard and went into a Room in the dark and rung the Bell . I carried a Candle to 'em . They called for half a Pint of Port I sent my Drawer with it . They rung again for a Porter to call a Coach - Do they take this to be a Coffee house , says I . Do they think that out of half a Pint of Wine I can afford to fe d a Porter on their Errand ? Let 'em walk - My Porter however was not then in the way tho ' he soon after came in and went of several Errands for them . I was told they expected more Company and would stay and sup - They had a cool Tankard - some Steaks - and a Tankard of Oat Ale . They went away at near eleven without paying the Reckoning ; and carried off the two Silver Tankards , as I have too much reason to believe . I can not swear that the Prisoner was one of them , for when I carried in the Candle , one of them turned his Face from me . Thomas Woodhouse , Porter . The two Men were in the Fourteen The Prisoner ordered me to go to The Swan Alehouse about three Doors off , and ask for one Mr. Emes . I went , but no such Person was there . I am positive to the Prisoner , for I know perfectly well that he is the Man . Then they sent me to The Bull Head in Fleet-Street to enquire for the same Person . I was told that a Gentleman of that name had been there , and that he was a very topping Gentelman , but he was not there then . I came back with this Message and found the Prisoner standing at the Head of the Alley , and looking as I thought for me . He went in and I follow 'd . I then saw but one Tankard . They bid me drink , and as I was going out , the Prisoner called me in again , and said , Porter do so much as step to Tom . King 's , in the Market ( 't is a Night-house in Covent Garden ) and see if Mr. Emes is not theres . I went , but could not meet with him - I believe I was not gone above three Minutes , but when I returned the Prisoner and his Companion were gone . Giles Wilton . My Master carried a Candle into the Fourteen , and sent me for half a Pint of Red which I carried to them - They asked- for a Porter to fetch a Coach . They ordered a Cool Tankard . My Master said , I do n't like those Men take care of the Tankard ; Its yours if its lost They would fain have made the Cool Tankard themselves , but I told 'em I wanted the Strainer and Spoon . So I made it , and took the Spoon and Strainer away . They had some Steaks . They bid me give the Steaks to the Cook to set them before the Fire for a Gentleman who was not yet come . I did so . I believe the Prisoner was one of them ; indeed I am not sure of it , but I think I know him by his Speech - Our Porter having subscribed him to several Persons , we heard that his Name was Dun , and that he lived in Flower de luce Court I enquired at his Lodgings , but was told he had been gone thence three Days ; I spoke to a Silver Smith just by , and the Prisoner came up and leaned over the Rails , and then pursued away . I follow 'd him to the Golden Lion in Fetter Lane and sent for our Porter ; but when he came , the Prisoner was gone , and we were told that he was to come there again at three o'Clock . But understanding that he was gone to his Lodgings , I went thither , and his Landlady still denyed him . But at last a Man in the House said that he was there , and I said , that I had got a Warrant for him . So the Prisoner came down and push 'd me from the Door , but he was soon secured - When he was carried before the Justice , he said , that he supp 'd that Sunday Night in Salisbury Court , and that he had a black Suit of Clothes on . I went to the House in Salisbury Court and they told me there , that he went away from thence a little after nine o'Clock . Prisoner . Will you swear that ? Wilton . Yes ; and I am certain of it , and the Constable heard the same . Bartholomew Powel , the Cook . The two Men in the Fourteen , ordered some Steaks . I carried them in , and as I was going out again one of the Men asked me to drink Part of a Cool Tankard , and then , he asked if we had any Oat Ale , I said , Yes . He ordered a Tankard of it , I spoke to Fisher , and he carried a Tankard in . I verily believe the Prisoner to be the Man by his Stature , his Voice , and partly by his Complexion and Dress . Prisoner . Here , Drawer ! I insist upon it that you shall swear that I am the Man , or else retract all that you have said . Wilton . I say that I believe you to be the Man . Joseph Fisher . I laid the Cloth for the Steaks , and carried in the Tankard of Oat Ale and left both the Tankards there . I saw no more than the side Faces of the Men ; and I remember one of them had such a Grey Coat as the Prisoner now has ; but I ca n't be positive to his Person . Margaret Steel . At a little past Ten , as I was coming down Stairs by the Fourteen with a Candle in my Hand the Prisoner was at the Door and asked for the Porter , I said that I would call the Porter , he said , Do . I am satisfied he is the Man - He had on the same Wig , the same Coat , and the Features ; and I am as certain of it as any one can be . Jane Duncan . Between ten and eleven I was going down to draw some Beer , the Door of the fourteen was open at the same time . The Drawer came out of the Fourteen with Steaks , and shut the Door after him The Prisoner , as I take him to be , opened it again . I can not swear to his Person , but as I take it , that Man had the same Wig , Iron Grey Coat , and Black Waistcoat and Breeches as the Prisoner has now . Prisoner She came to view me yesterday in the Bail Dock and took notice of my Clothes - last Sunday about three in the Afternoon , I went to the House of Mrs. Havers , in Salisbury Court , where I staid till after eleven , and then went home to my Lodging in Flower de luce Court , and Mrs. Goody let me in . Mrs. Havers . I have known the Prisoner eleven or twelve Years ; he bears a very good Character ; he learns Gentlemen Languages . Prisoner . I teach Latin and Greek , but chiefly French - I was bred a Physician . Mrs. Havers . Last Sunday at about half an Hour past three in the afternoon , he came to my House in Salisbury Court , and did not go once out , till a quarter before eleven . Catherine R per , Elizabeth Cole , and Christian Newman ( who were Lodgers in Mrs. Havers 's House ) all swore to the same particulars . Dorothy Goody . I live in Flower de luce Court on this side Fetter Lane in Fleet Street . The Prisoner is my Lodger ; he knocked at the Door a little before eleven , and went up directly into his Room , but came down again , and said , he was going to the Three Tuns ( which is in the same Court ) for some Tobacco . He went and returned in a few Minutes . Mr. Walker , Mr. King , the Coroner , Mr Ashton , Mr. Mitchell . of the Jewel Office/ , Mr. Shadwell , and Mr. Jekyll , gave the Prisoner the Character of a very honest , sober and worthy Gentleman . Several other Gentleman appeared ready to speak to his Character , but the Court thought it unnecessary . The Jury acquitted him . 47.

Elizabeth Calloway , was indicted for maliciously setting on Fire her own Dwelling-House , with an Intent to burn the Houses of Simon Batty and Richard Monk , and thereby did set on fire and burn the Houses of the said Batty and Monk June 9 . Claudius Meldicot . I have lodged near two Years in the Prisoner 's House , she kept a Brandy Shop in Cecil Court , near St. Martin 's Lane . For a Quarter of a Year past she has not lain at home four Nights in a Month ; and sometimes she used to carry out some things in a Handkerchief About three Months ago as I was going up Stairs , she called me in and said , she had insured her Goods for two Hundred Pound though I do not believe they were worth Forty Pound - On Saturday before the Fire , she told me . she 'd come next Day to my Lodge in the Mews , and give me a Treat of half a Crown . I got the Lodge ready , but she did not come . On Monday she said she 'd certainly come at night . So about Ten at night she sent me word she was coming , and would have me get five or six Bottles of Sussex Beer for fear the People that sold it should be abed . In a quarter of an hour , my Wife and Mr. Clark and another Lodger came . I asked where my Landlady was . My Wife answered , she sent Mrs. Clark for two Candles , and as soon as the Candles came , she bid us go and she would follow presently . There is no body with her but Lucas - Lucas is a Foot Soldier . In about a Quarter of an Hour the Prisoner and Lucas came together ; she call 'd for Tobacco , and said she 'd smoke her Pipe - I went to the Gate , and somebody said , Lord ! how light it is here in the Mews . The Prisoner came out frighted . as I thought , and said , I wish it may not be in our Court . This was about a quarter of an Hour after she came . Mary Batty . My House joyn 'd to the Prisoner 's . Near eleven at Night , the Prisoner was standing at her own Door ; a Neighbour coming to talk with me , the Prisoner went in and shut her Door . But in two or three Minutes it was opened again , a lusty Man came out and went towards the Mews . I do n't know who it was , for it was dark , and his Back was towards me . The Prisoner stood two or three Minutes at her Door , and then stept off the Threshold , put her Finger into the Key Hole , and pulled the Door too , and I heard the Lock catch - Her Door used to be shut between nine and ten , and her Company within , drinking , smoaking , and swearing , and running up and down Stairs till one or two in the Morning ; but I believe no body was now left in the House , except a poor Woman and her Daughter that lived in the Cellar . I thought I smelt a Fire . I took a Candle to go and look at my Mother who was ill , but before I could do it , I heard the poor Woman in the Cellar cry out Fire , and presently I heard a great Crack , the Fire burst out , and the Prisoner 's Room up two pair of Stairs was all in a Blaze . I ran into the Street and saw the Fire in the two pair of Stairs Room and in the Shop below , but none up one pair of Stairs , which I thought was very strange - I lost all that I had in the World - but I believe the Prisoner lost nothing . William Nash . At about half an Hour past eleven o'Clock , being in St. Martin 's Court , I smelt Fire . I and a Watchman ran round to Cecil Court , and found the Prisoner 's back Room behind her Shop in a Flame . We broke the Shutters down , I got in and catched up two Casks in the Shop to save them , but they were empty . The Fire in the low Room had catched hold of the Stairs , but in the first Floor over this there was no Fire at all , and yet at the same time the Room up two pair of Stairs was all in a Blaze - I have no knowledge of the Prisoner . John . I do not know that I ever saw the Prisoner before . But as I was drinking in St. Martin 's Court , I heard an out-cry of Fire - I run to Cecil 's Court , and found Nash tearing down the Shutters ; I assisted him , and entered the House . All the back Room was in Flames , but I saw no Goods at all in it . I examined five or six Casks in the Shop , but found no Liquor in them , so I threw them into the Court . The People without desired me to open the Door , which I did , for it was a spring Lock , but then the Door and Shutter being open , gave such a vent to the Flames , that I was forced to get out . John Lock . I lived opposite to the Prisoner . At about a quarter past eleven , I was smoaking a Pipe of Tobacco at my own Door , and saw the Prisoner come out at her Door , and stand a little , and then pull the Door to , and go away . In about five Minutes I heard a cry of Fire , I ran out and saw the Sparks fly , and the upper Story next the Garret in a Flame . But at that time I saw no Fire below - I knocked at the Door , but hearing nothing , I ran into St. Martin 's Lane to call Assistance . Elizabeth Charley . I live in the Prisoner 's Cellar , I came home about four in the Afternoon , and about seven she asked me for Rent , I said , I owe you nothing till Quarter Day . No Mother Feltham , says she ( Feltham was my first Husband 's Name ) I come to ask you to go with us to Claudius 's , and to bring your Daughter and Grandson with ye . We must not go all together , but one after another , for fear some Rogue should take notice and rob the House . I told her I was weary with my Day 's Labour , and must go to bed , and besides it would be an unseasonable time for the Child to be out . Why , says she , wont the Child sleep till you come back ? It shall cost you nothing , for I 'll spend three Shillings , and if you wont go your self let your Daughter go . But still I said no , we must go to bed , she said she was sorry for that . So I went down , and about eight of the Clock I came up again to fasten my Cellar . Says she , are ye going to bed then ? I answered , yes ; and she said , poor old Woman ! I shut my Door , and went to bed with my Daughter and fell asleep . I was waked with a great Noise of something falling down , but I was so used to hear a Noise in her House which made me that I did not so much mind , and was going to sleep again , but presently I heard another fall , and then a third with a violent Crack . This thoroughly waked me , and I waked my Daughter , and looking up where the Cieling was broke , we saw the Fire . She got up , but I was so frighted that for a while I could not find the way out of bed . I bid her open the Door ; she said she could not unlock it ; I bid her to break it open . As soon as I could get up , I went to help her , and at last we got out ; but by that time every Room in the House was on fire , except the Garret . Juryman . Did she ever offer to treat you before ? E. Charley . Yes ; Once at Whitsuntide , when I paid her my Rent . James Verro , Watchman in the Mews . The Prisoner came to the Lodge at about a quarter past eleven , and they had two Decanters of Sussex Beer . About half an Hour past eleven , I told them there was a Fire , she said I hope it 's not in our House . She sent a Boy to see , but he did not return , and she went away her self at about twelve or a quarter after , and the seemed to have a pleasant Countenance . Charles de Sallo . I lodged in Cecil Court , and stood talking with Mrs. Batty when the Prisoner pulled her own Door and went away . In a few Minutes afterwards I went to my own Room and was scarce got in , when I heard the Cry of Fire . I threw up my Sash and saw Fire up two pair of Stairs but none below . John Swain . As I came out of one of the Houses that was on fire with a Clock on my Back , the Prisoner stood at the end of the Court next Castle-street . A Man went up to her , and she asked him if he had got That - I do not know what that was , nor did I hear the Man 's Answer , but she seemed to look very pleasant , and they went away together . Eleanor Pickhaver . I kept a Cook 's Shop next to the Prisoner 's . Five or six Weeks before the Fire , she sent a Woman for six Pennyworth of boild Beef , and in a little time the Woman came back with a few Scraps of it , and said it was all full of Sand . I asked some Gentlemen in the House ( whose Meat had been cut off the same Buttock ) if their Meat was sandy . They said , No . So I bid the Woman leave what she brought if she did not like it . She went back , and the Prisoner came in a hurry , and said , Hussy , keep my Money at your peril , I 'll soon cure ye of selling Meat here . This was confirmed by Henry Reading , Mrs. Pickhaver 's Apprentice . Prisoner . I never said any such thing ; but I told her if that was her way she would not be a Cook there long . Joseph Benfield . I saw Fire in the Shop and up two pair of Stairs , but none up one pair of Stairs . This I thought so strange , that I took particular notice of it , and look 'd the more at it but could see no sign of Fire in that part of the House . Elizabeth Atkins . I went for a Dram at the Prisoner 's House about a Fortnight before the Fire , and she desired me to fetch her four Brushes , which I did , and she said they were to air her Room . Prisoner . She did fetch me four Faggots sure enough . E. Atkins . They were not Faggots , they were Brushes , such as they have to kindle Fires with . Defence . Prisoner . I had several times appointed to go some Night to the Lodge , at the Mews ; I believe the first time is near a Year ago . On the Saturday before the Fire , Claudius Meldicot said to me , You have often promised to come but you never was so good as your word . Upon that I appointed to come the next Night , but I happened to forget it . And on Monday he complained to me of my not coming , when he had got the Lodge ready on purpose . I desired him to excuse me for that once and I would certainly come at night , which I accordingly did . And I shall prove that the Invitation was his and not mine - Call Thomas Lucas . Meldicot . This Lucas is the Soldier that was left with her in the House . Thomas Lucas . I lodged with the Prisoner three quarters of a Year , she kept very regular Hours , and I never saw any Disorder in her House , for she would never serve any body that was drunk . She made a Proposal , and promised to go to the Lodge on the eighth of June , but did not go . And that Night ( for she was always careful of Fire ) she asked me if I had let the Woman in the Garret have a Candle up to bed , because that Woman was subject to get drunk - Next Day I paid the Prisoner three Shillings , and Claudius Meldicot asked her if she would come , and she said she would spend that three Shillings . Prisoner . Did he ask me or I him ? Lucas . He said , Will you come ? Court . On your Oath , Did he invite her or she him ? Lucas . She had spoke of such a thing , but did not properly invite her self - But I was not present when she came out of her own House , for I went two or three Minutes before her to make Water ; and there was then not a bit of Fire , nor any Heat in the Chimney , nor I saw nothing of that nature in her Room . Prisoner . I had had no Fire in the House for four or five Weeks . Margaret Lucas . Meldicot said to her , You promised to come last Night , and I am very angry - but do - come to Night and I 'll get something . She refused at first , but she said afterwards , Well , since you will have me go , I 'll take all my Lodgers with me . Prisoner . Was there any Fire in the House ? M. Lucas . I saw no Fire , and I had none in my Room for five or six Weeks - I lodged up two pair of Stairs . She was mighty careful , and often came out of Bed to bid me take care of my Candle - I went to the Lodge a quarter of an Hour before her . As to the empty Casks , those on the upper Shelves were always empty , and only kept for a Shew . Susan Clark . I lodged a Year in the House , and never had a bit of Fire . Meldicot said , if she 'd come he 'd get something good to eat - She said she would , and sent Lucas to bid him get some Sussex Ale - And she bid us go first for fear if we went all together some body should get into the House . Prisoner . The Cook , s Shop joyning to mine , the Wainscot of my Closet was often so very hot that I was afraid it would some time or other be set on Fire , and for that reason I insured my House in the Exchange Insurance . Luke Clark . She told me five Months before that she would insure , because of the Cook 's Shop . Henry Stevens . In February or March last , she came to me several times to go with her to the Insurance Office . The last time she came I asked her why she was in such haste ; she said , she was often alarmed by the Heat of her Closet next to the Cook 's Shop . So I went with her and she Insured one Hundred and fifty Pound on her Shop Goods . Indeed she said that sometimes she had not the value of twenty Shillings in her Shop , tho ' sometimes she had more . Mary Bushel . I often lay with the Prisoner . and she has often called me to feel how hot her Closer was . The last time which was at Christmas , it was so hot that I could not bear my Head in it . Her own Room was then very well furnished , and so were the Rooms for Lodgers , considering what sort of People they were . And then she said she would insure her Goods , but did not know which way to go about it . Mary Reeves , Ann Hornby , Nathaniel Collins , Hugh Berry , Mary Marshall and Martha Billy deposed that they had seen nothing by the Prisoner but what was honest , nor had heard any ill Character of her before , and did not think she would set Fire to a House . The Jury acquitted her 53. Mary Loyd , was indicted for stealing a Shift , an Apron , a Handkerchief , a Mob , and a Tortoise Shell Snuff Box with a Silver Rim , the Goods of William Gordon , June 15 . The Prosecutor and his Wife were burnt out at the Fire in Cecil Court , and afterwards took Lodgings in Cranbourn Alley , the Prisoner was their Servant , she recommended herself to them by a Letter of her own forging in the Name of a Gentlewoman of Credit . She went away while the Prosecutor and his Wife were gone from home . When they returned they mist their Goods . In a few Days she was taken with the Goods upon her , and being brought to the Prosecutor 's House , she pulled them all off and returned them . It appeared that she had a very ill Character , and the Jury acquitted her . 54. Eleanor Plasty , was indicted for stealing six Curtains , and five China Dishes , the Goods of William Gordon , June 19 . The Prisoner had formerly been Servant to the Prosecutor , and when his House in Cecil Court was on Fire , she came with a pretence to assist . Mary Loyd being ( as in the last Trial apprehended ) she gave them some reason to suspect the Prisoner , and thereupon her Lodgings being searched , the Goods were found . The Jury acquitted her . 55. Elizabeth Barns , was indicted for stealing a Shirt , an Apron , & c. the Goods of Joseph Pindar , January 28 . Acquitted . 56.

On the ninteenth of May between seven and eight at Night , the Prisoner and Thomas Martin came to my House , the Fleece in South Halstead , with a Black Gelding and a Mare . Next Morning he offered to sell the Gelding . A Blacksmith fetched a Gentleman who wanted a Horse . The Prisoner asked eight Guineas , the Gentleman bid five but the Money was refused . Mr. Trayhem offered seven Guineas if they could bring a Voucher . Then they pretended they had hired the Horse of a Smuggler in Southwark , who was under a Cloud , and could not appear - They both got out of the House , and ran away , without their Horses . They were pursued different Ways . Martin escaped , but the Prisoner was taken at Coggeshall , and the Justice convicted him to Bridewell . Prisoner . What Coat had I on ? Newton . A Blue Coat , the same as you had on when you were brought from Chelmsford in a Basket . Prisoner . I travel the Country and sell Handkerchiefs . I met Thomas Martin ( who is now a Prisoner below ) with two Horses . I asked him to let me ride and he gave me leave , I rid with him to Halstead where he desired me to put off one of the Horses , and so I , thinking no harm , offered this Horse to sell .

That they knock 'd him down and he calling for help , Matthews with a Hammer struck him several Blows on the Head and left him for dead . They sold the Watch for thirty Shillings to Mrs. Weston in Cable Street in the Parish of St George 's in the East , she knowing them to be stolen . And that on the sixth or seventh of May . They with John Keeble about twelve at Night broke into a Collier lying in the Thames below Execution Dock , and stole a Grey Suit , a Brown Suit trim 'd with Silver , two Great Coats , one Red and one Blue , a Pair of Silver Buckles , a Pair of Shoes , and a Natural Wig , the Captain being all the while a Sleep in the Cabbin ; all which ( except the Wig , Buckles and Shoes ) they sold to the said Weston . And the tenth or eleventh of May , he , Pup 's Nose and Matthews , stole out of the Marshes at Gravesend , a Black Gelding and a Brown Mare , and sold the Mare to Thomas Jones a Butcher in Colchester , and the Horse to a Farrier against the Maidenhead in Colchester , for a Guinea and a half Crown Bowl of Punch .

In September 1734. he was tryed with Will . Newell alias Blackhead , for stealing Goods out of a Ship . Blackhead was found Guilty and Pup 's Nose acquitted . Thomas Thorey . On the nineteenth of May , I mist my Mare out of Mr. Webb 's Field , I advertised her , and heard she was at Halstead , I not being well Mr. Webb went down and brought her up to me . Thomas Webb . I found the Mare at Mr. Newton 's at Halstead - Hearing afterwards that the Prisoner was in the New Jail in Southwark , and ( not telling him that I knew where the Mare was ) he told me that both the Mare and the Horse were at Halstead . John Newton . On the fifteenth of May the Prisoner on the Mare , and Macdonald on a Back Gelding came riding to my Door in Halstead . I put the Horse and Mare in one Stable . The Prisoner and Macdonald were mighty Quisitive for a good Bed . They lay together , and next Morning the Prisoner offered to sell the Mare to a Butcher . Mr. Trahern , came to look at the Gelding and asked them if they could bring Voucher In six or eight Minutes after which , the Prisoner and Macdonald got off and went away together without paying their Reckoning . But they left the Horse and Mare , which the Justice advised me to keep till I found the Owners - I afterwards delivered the Mare to Mr. Webb . Prisoner . What did I go for ? Newton I thought they were Partners when they first came , but next Morning the Prisoner said that Macdonald was his Master . For the Prisoner offered to swop the Mare with me for a Horse , and says he , if this Mare wont do , my Master can help you to another for he has five or six at Braintree . Lynnell Lea . Macdonald having made a Confession in hopes of saving himself , he desired us to secure the Prisoner . I and Mr. Webb enquired after him , and hearing he was in the New Goal , we went thither , and without letting him know we had been at Halstead , we asked him if he knew of such a Mare , he said , Yes , and told us in particular that he and Macdonald took her and a Gelding out of Mr Webb 's Field , and then stole a Saddle , and rode to Brentwood , where they put up , and from thence rode to Halstead ; and that he had made a Confession before Justice Lade in Order to hang Macdonald . Prisoner . I used to Rig Ships , and carry them to Grave 's End , and to work upon the Keys , and do business in the Country . And so upon Thursday Morning about six o'Clock , as I was going into Essex to see for Work , I happened to meet with one Macdonald with a Horse and a Mare , and he being upon the Horse , I asked him to let me ride the Mare to Brentwood , Well , says he , Get up Sirrah . So up I got , and when we came to Brentwood , I thanked him , and said , I was then far enough in the Country to find Work . Why I 'll tell ye what my Lad , says he , If you ride the Mare farther , I 'll give ye two Shillings , for I want to sell her and the Horse too . So I agreed , and when we came to Halsted I offered to sell her . But while we were making a Bargain , he went out and bid me follow him , which I did , and then says he , G - D - ye , ye Pup 's Nose Son of a Bitch , ( for that was the Name he gave me ) we are both done for ; we shall both be hanged , for I stole the Horses - Why are not you a vile Rogue now , says I , to bring an innocent young Fellow into such a scrape ; suppose now that I really should be hanged for this , What a fine Jobb of Work there would be . Ye Dog , says he , If I am taken , I 'll turn Evidence and hang ye my self Sure you wont be such a Villain , says I , when you know in your Conscience that I had no hand in it . It 's no matter for that , says he , I know the way of it , for I have hanged three at the Old Baily . But I 'll take care , says I , that you sha n't hang me , for I wo n't be catch 'd - And yet I am catch 'd too , at last , for all I thought my self so cunning - So when we were got about a Mile and a half out of Town , I sees three Men coming after us on Horse-back ; I guest what they wanted , and thought it was high time to take care of one , and so I left him to shift for himself , like a Rogue as he was , and got over a Hedge and run to London . Then I went to Mr. Lingards in Southwark , and told the People there what a hopeful Master I had met with , and how I had like to have been taken up for a Horse-stealer . When they had heard this , they told me truly that I must go with them before Sir John Lade , and tell him the whole Story ; and when I had done that , Sir John Lade sent me to the New Jail , and there I soon heard that Macdonald was as vile a Dog as ever trod Shoe of Leather .
