On the 3d of May , between four and five in the Afternoon , the Prisoner came into my Shop and asked for a Pair of grey Stockings ; I asked him what Price ; he said about 4 s. 6 d. he looked on several Pair , and thought they were hardly fine enough , and as I was getting some others , I turned my Eyes on one Side , and saw him shuffle this Pair into his Pocket ; he had hardly got them in ; I said to him , I suppose , Master , you design to pay me for that Pair of Stockings you have in your Pocket . Says he , I have none in my Pocket , there is the Pair of Stockings I took lying on the Ground . There was a Pair lying on the Ground ; but they were of a darker Colour . I went up to him , and said , I will be certain whether you have them or no ; I laid hold of his Collar , and gave a Knock , and my Wife and Maid came up ; he fell down upon his Knees and begged for Mercy , and said it was the first Fact that ever he committed . My Wife was for running her Hand into his Pocket to take the Stockings out , but he would not let her ; then he put his Hand into his Pocket , pulled out two Pair , and threw them down ; that was one Pair more than I knew of . This is one of the Pair he pulled out . Prisoner . Did not you search me yourself before your Wife and Maid came into the Shop ? Cremer . No indeed , I did not . Elizabeth Standen .

William Ceeley . I saw three Boys lurking about . I did not see the Prisoner go into Mr Dyer 's , but I saw him come out . His two Confederates waited for him in Crown-Court , and the Skirt was found in Dorset-Court , by Channel Row , by a Servant Maid : Mr Fairbourne 's Boy and I , went in pursuit of the Prisoner , and coming into Channel-Row , I came directly upon him , and laid hold of him . Guilty , 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 250. Jane Pearse , of St James Westminster , was indicted for stealing five Pewter Pots , val . 5 s. the Goods of John Humston , April 21 . John Humston . The Prisoner came to my House pretty often for about six Weeks past , for half a Pint of Purl ; I observed her one Day to take a Pint Pot out , I followed her , searched her , and found it upon her ; and three more at her House ; she owned she had melted down one , and sold it to a Pewterer for Six-Pence ; that was a Quart Pot ; these are my Pots ( three Pints , and one Quart Pot ) . Prisoner . I do own , that the young Man did take a Pint Pot out of my Pocket ; I did it out of down-right Want and Necessity , I never did any such Thing before in my Life . Guilty , 10 d.

Ann Rhodes , of St Vedast Foster , was indicted for stealing twelve Yards of black Silk Lace , val . 4 s. 6 d. the Goods of John Sage and John Gopp , April 28 . John Sage . The Prisoner and another Woman , came into my Shop on the 28th of April , between Three and Four , in the Afternoon , and asked for some black Silk Lace ; I showed her some , she did not seem to like any of them , and asked to see some others ; I had two or three Customers with me , so I told her , I should have more next Week , if they would come then ; which they agreed to do : I saw her take the Lace , and followed her into the Street , and took her into my Next-door Neighbour 's Shop , and took the Lace from under her Arm ; before she went out of the Shop , I saw a bit of it hanging down , and then I took the Box of Lace away , because I would not be deceived by her shuffling it into the Box again : I know it is my Lace , because it has my Mark on it . Prisoner . I did not take it with a Design to steal it , but only as a Pattern ( but the Prisoner said afterwards , that she did not know she took it out of the Shop ; that it might be by Chance , that she had it under her Arm ) . Mr Tomkins . The Prisoner lived in our Family as a Chamber-Maid , between two and three Years , and has been gone about three Months ; we never mistrusted her Honesty , if we had , we should not have kept her so long ; nor was she turned away upon any Suspicion of that Kind , and we had a very good Character of her from a Relation of ours that she lived with ; I never heard any Thing amiss of her . Barnabas Tunstal I have known the Prisoner , a great many Years , her Character was always very good ; I knew her in several Places , particularly the last Place she lived in ; I know all her Friends in the Country very well ; she has very good Friends in Yorkshire . Prosecutor . The Lace was loose under her Arm ; if she had opened her Arm , it must have fell down : Since her Commitment , several Gentlemen have been with me , who gave her a very good Character ; and , I believe it to be the first Offence . Acquitted . 253 + Elizabeth Parker , of St. John the Evangelist , was indicted for stealing 24 Pewter-Plates , 2 Pewter Dishes , 1 Silver Tea-spoon , a Cloth Coat , a Waistcoat , 2 Pair of Breeches , a Hat , a Perriwig , a Camblet Gown , 1 Pair of Shoes , 1 black quilted Petticoat , 7 Shirts , 1 Sheet , 1 pair of Pockets , & c. The Goods of Thomas Martin , in his Dwelling-House , Apr . 29 . Tho Martin . The Prisoner was my Servant ; she lived with me about two Years ago ; had been away from me , and came again lately ; she was hired to come on the 12th of April , and she pretended she had been robbed two or three Days before , going home ; that she was stripped , and had lost her Gold Ring , and that it was a great Mercy she had saved her Gold Necklace ; that she had catched a great Cold , and was to come the next Day . Court . Give an Account of the Robbery . Martin . I will show you what was preceding the Robbery , and then the Robbery itself . She came the 13th ; she went away the 17th , pretending to be ill of a sore Throat , and did not return again till Tuesday se'ennight following , which was the 26th ; in which Interim of Time , she sent a Message to let us know , that she was ill , and desired that somebody might do her Business , and she would pay for it . On Wednesday the 27th she was to wash , ( some time before this she was to have washed ) and when she came to take out a ten Gallon Kettle which we wash in , there was a Hole in it , which we imagine to have been made by herself , because we never observed it before ; the perswaded my Wife to let the Kettle go to be mended , and told her that all the Pots and Kettles wanted tinning , and perswaded her to let them go to an Acquaintance of her 's : She carried that great Kettle , a Pot , 5 Saucepans , and a Stew-pan , and brought home but two of the Saucepans ; on Thursday Night I came home about 12 o'Clock , they had been washing that Day , and the Cloaths were hanging up to dry in the Kitchen upon a wooden Horse : I went to draw a little Small-Beer , and saw a Rush-light burning on the Stairs , and a parcel of Linnen and Plates lying there ; I went up Stairs and asked her the Reason of the Candle 's being left , she said she designed to clean the House , ( and told my Wife she would make the House as white as a Curd ) I suppose that was to prevent our minding of it if we should hear any rustling or Noise : A little after 6 o'Clock I got up , and found the Back-Door open , and the Garden-Door unbolted , which I always take Care to see fast at Night ; upon returning in again ( for I thought she was gone out a gossipping with some Neighbour or other , not having any Imagination of what she had done ) I bolted the Door and went up Stairs ; my Wife said , It is a fine Morning , I will get up too ; and when she got up , she found we were stripp 'd , and that the Prisoner was gone ; she seem 'd to have some Judgment in doing it , for she pulled these Papers out of my Coat-Pocket , and left them upon a Chair . I miss 'd all the things mentioned in the Indictment , and several more ; I miss 'd my Shoes and Coat , which I had worn the Day before ; I believe she could not well carry any more , for it was near an hundred Weight . She had taken my Wife 's Keys out of her Pocket , and taken several things out of the Drawers , but she left the Keys on the Table in the Kitchen . - She was gone out of the House when I bolted the Garden-Door ; then I began to recollect where her Friends liv 'd ; for she had told me formerly , that she lived somewhere in Whitechapel , and that her Friends lived in More-lane by Morefields . However , the next Day I advertis 'd them , and described her Person ; on the Monday following , three Jews came to me , pretending they could help me to take the Person that robb 'd me , and told me there was some of the things sold among their Jews , and one Mylock said he had bought some of the Goods , one Jacobs came with two or three more Persons afterwards ; and when she was taken up , and carried before Sir John Thompson , she confess 'd the Fact , and would have sworn it on Jacob Lopez and Abraham Mylock ; she said that she had part of the Goods , and that Mylock and Lopez had the rest . Counc . You tell us your Suspicions , I know you belong to the Law , and you should know that you are to speak nothing but what you are positive of ; Did you take positive Notice of what Linnen lay there ? Mr Martin . No indeed ; I can not say I did . Q . You say she took your Wife 's Pocket , Did you see your Wife put it under her Head ? Mr Martin . No : but I saw the Strings of it hang down by her Head . Q . Do you know the Drawers were lock 'd ? Mr Martin . Yes , I do . Q . Was not your Chamber-Door fastened ? Mr Martin . My Chamber-Door was fastened , but the Door between the two Rooms was not fastened . Q . You say she would have impeached Lopez and Mylock , Why did not you indict them ? Mr Martin . Mylock behaved in such a manner that I did not believe him innocent , but I was not willing to part with a Person I could convict , for one that I had not sufficient Evidence to convict . Tho Bretter . On the 29th of April , about a quarter after 5 in the Morning , I was coming from Mr Scott 's Brewhouse in the Broad-Way , with six Gallons of Beer ; my Wife ( for I am very dull of hearing ) heard somebody say , Will you earn Sixpence ? my Wife told me of it , and I said Yes ; and the Prisoner said she would pay me , and helped me up with the things upon my Back , ( this was just by the Artillery-Wall near Tothill Fields Bridewell , which is about 200 Yards from Mr. Martin 's House ) they were tied up in a large ordinary Sheet , it was in two Parts , that Part which hung upon my Back seemed to be Copper , but it was tied so close that I could not see what was in the Inside . I carried it to the Horse-Ferry Whars , and the Prisoner went along with me , and this Waterman ( Henry Ware ) lifted them off my Shoulder , and carried them down the Wharf himself , the Prisoner followed the Waterman down the Wharf , and I turned back ; I never saw the Woman before that Time , nor since till now . Henry Ware . I live at Lambeth , and happened to get a Fare to Westminster Horse-Ferry , and thought to stay to get another back again , and instead of that , I happened to get one to London ; this Man ( Bretter ) came with a Bundle on his Shoulder , and I asked him if he wanted a Sculler , he said no , but that there was a Woman coming behind who wanted one ; and I asked her if she wanted a Sculler , and she said , Yes ; What must I give you , said she , to carry me to the three Cranes ; Nine-Pence , said I , For with that Bundle it deserves it ; she said , she would not give it ; then said I , If you will not give me so much , give me Six-Pence , and a Pint of Beer ; she said , she would give me no Pint , she would give me but Six-Pence ; when we came there , I asked her if she wanted a Porter to carry it up ; she said , Yes ; I said , I would carry it for her ; ( it was to go into Little Morefields ) but , when I got it upon my Shoulder , I found it was too heavy for me , and I asked a Waterman whether he would not earn a Jobb , but he would not : The Things were tied up in a Linnen Cloth , and some of the Plates fell out , I believe there might be half a Dozen of them ; I called to her , and told her , there were some of them fell out ; ( she said , there were Plates and Linnen ) I could not get a Porter , but there came a young Man , who undertook the Jobb , and she took the Plates up , and put them into the Bundle again herself . Q . How far is it from the Artillery-Wall , to the Ferry ? Bretter . Full half a Mile . Q . To Ware . What Time was it , when the Prisoner came to you ? Ware . It was full half an Hour after Five , and when I got against St. Paul 's , the Clock struck Six ; and , I said to the young Woman , the Clock strikes Six now ; this was on Friday , and it was Monday , before I heard any more of it . Q . How came you to recollect this Particular , that it was on a Friday ? Ware . Because Mr Martin had put her into the Paper . Q . But this does not tell me , how you came to find her out ? Ware . I did not find her out ; I did not see her again , till I came to Guild-Hall ; I knew her as soon as I saw her , and she knew me . Mr Martin came to me , and asked me if I did not carry such a Fare . Q . Do you think you could know a Fare , that you carried last Friday ? Ware . I can not tell , whether I could or no , but I know this Woman ; I might not take so much Notice of every Fare I carry . Q . Do you think this Man ( Bretter ) could carry that Bundle of Things so far in a Quarter of an Hour ; 't is above half a Mile , and he is an older Man than you ? Ware . I do not know that , but I believe it may be done . Burgess Yerwood . The Prisoner came to my House , with two Sancepans to be tinned , and asked me , whether I would buy any Pots , Kettles , and Sauce-pans ; she said , her Mistress sent her ; I asked her , where she lived , and I would go and see them , she said her Mistress 's Name was Martin , but that she would not let me see her ; she brought them , and giving a very plausible Account of the Thing , ( for I am as careful of buying stolen Goods , as any Body ) I agreed to give her Fifteen Shillings for them ; she said , she would go and tell her Mistress , and I gave her Fifteen Shillings ; they were old Things , and I knocked them all to Pieces : - I can not tell whether it was before , or after the Robbery : I can not tell what Day of the Month it was . I think , it was on a Wednesday , that the Saucepans were tinned , and that she came on Thursday Morning , and then I weighed the Pots , & c. and paid her for them . A Boy , about Fourteen Years of Age , was produced , but not being able to give the Court a satisfactory Answer , with relation to the Nature of an Oath , he was not examined . Mary Martin . The Prisoner came to me on 12th of April , pretending that she came to see me ; I asked her , how she came to know where I lived ; she said , she came to enquire a Servant 's Character for her Aunt , and so enquired after me ; said I , Why do n't you live with your Aunt ; she said , she would sooner live with a Stranger , than live with her ; and , I did then ask her , whether she would come and live with me ; and she said she would , I hired her then , and she came the Day after : The Sunday following , she pretended she had a sore Throat , that was the 17th ; I said , she might go to her Friends , and she staid till the 26th ; and , on the 29th she robbed me . On Thursday Night , I went to Bed before my Husband came home ; this Boy [ He that was produced , but not examined ] runs of Errands for us , and he went away about half an Hour after Nine ; and she desired me to go to Bed betimes , because I had had a hard Day 's Work : Mr. Martin came home about Twelve o'Clock at Night , and she had laid down on the Side of the Bed by me ; for I had a Servant died in the House , and , I am afraid to lie by my self . When my Husband came home , she said , she would get up very early , and wash the Kitchen before I got up , and it should be as white as a Curd ; and desired if I should wake , that I would call her up at Four o'Clock ; I said , it would be too soon to get up , after such a hard Day 's Work . Q . What did she take from you ? Mrs Martin . She took every Thing I had ; I had not a Shift left , but what I had on : [ She then mentioned the Things as in the Indictment ; a China Tea-Pot , with a Silver Spout , & c. ] Q . Did you wake and call her ? Mrs Martin . No , I did not ? Q . Have you any of these Things to produce ? Mrs Martin . No , I have none of the Things , because she had sold them . Q . Was she sober when she laid down by you ? Mrs Martin . Yes , she was sober ; I do not know whether she slept ; I thought she was tired , and for that Reason I desired her to lie down on the Bed . The Prisoner 's Council pleaded , that it could not amount to a Felony , because the Goods were put under the Prisoner 's Care ; but the Court were of a different Opinion . Prisoner 's Defence . As to the Kettle and Pot my Mistress sent me to sell them to Mr Yerwood . I carried two of the Saucepans home , and had 15 s. for what I sold , and paid 18 d. for tinning the two , and gave her 13 s. 6 d. to pay the Surgeon for curing her Hand . My Mistress harrasses me Night and Day , sending me about one trifling Errand or another ; for she is either out of her Senses , or else has drank herself out of them . My Mistress sent me about to get a Nurse-Child for her ; Ann Davis knows she used to be always sending me about one idle thing or another ? Ann Davis . I never knew Mrs Martin send her about any Nurse Children , nor I never saw her out of her Senses . She has always used her well ; more like a Child than a Servant . Prisoner . My Mistress has had Money out of my Pocket , and my Cloaths off my Back , to pawn . Mrs Davis knows she carried the Spoon to pawn herself , and they charge me with it . Davis . I never did , while the Prisoner was in the House , carry any Silver Spoon to pawn . Ann Kidder . I have known the Prisoner about twenty Years , she was Servant with me about twelve Months . I have trusted her with twenty or thirty Pound at a Time , and she never wronged me . I never heard she ever did any Wrong , or ever knew her turned away upon any Suspicion of such a Thing . Mary Avery . I have known the Prisoner ever since she sucked at her Mother 's Breast ; she has lived with me twice ; I never knew but that she always acted honestly ; she always behaved well ; she came twice to my House in the Time she was there , and said Mrs Martin wanted a Nurse-Child . Mr Martin was at my House on the Sunday , and told me that he was robbed on the Friday , ( I ask Pardon for it dashes me ) and said his Wife was a very great Drunkard , and would be the Ruin of him . Mr Martin . The Goods were carried to her Mother 's House . Sarah Fuller . I have known the Prisoner from a Babe ; she always behaved well in the Neighbourhood . I never heard an ill Character of her in my Life . Ann Hardman . I lived by the Prisoner 's Mother these twenty Years , and never heard any Harm of the Prisoner . Susannah Ramsay . I have known the Prisoner the best Part of seven Years , and never heard a miss Word of her in my Life . Another Witness had known her ever since she was a little Girl in Frocks , and never heard she was turned away from any Place upon the Account of any Wrong she did , or that she was ever guilty of any such Crime . Acquitted . 254. Andrew Thomas Davenport , of St Paul Covent-Garden , was indicted for stealing five Yards of black Velvet , val . 40 s. ten Yards of Silk Damask , val . 3 l. and forty Yards of Lustring , val . 5 l. the Goods of Robert Buck , and Robert Swan , April 16 . Robert Buck . On the 13th of April , I had an Information of the Prisoner 's having robbed us , and was directed to go to one Madam Deson 's Lodging , and there I found several Sorts of Silk which were mine ; I went home to my Shop , seized the Prisoner , and charged him with the Robbery , ( he has been Apprentice to Mr Swan , who is my Partner , three Years ) at first he denied it , but afterwards owned it . He had got acquainted with this Woman , and he had hired a Coach , in Order to have gone to France with her , and he would certainly have gone that Evening . Some of these Goods were made up into Garments , and some of them have our own Mark upon them . There was a white Damask , and the Lustrings were made into Dresses , for Madam Deson 's Use ; and the black Velvet was made into a Waistcoat and Breeches . Q . How do you know these are your Goods ? Buck . We have a very regular Method of entering them in a Number-Book , and keeping an Account of what is cut off each Piece , in order to know whether we are defrauded by our Servants or no ; and there are particular Patterns which we know . I compared this Pattern with a Piece of Damask in our Shop , and found it to be part of that Piece , which appeared to be deficient by the Number-Book ; and there were about forty Yards of Lustring deficient . Court . Sir , when you and your Partner are out , and any Person comes to buy any Lustring or Damask , has the Prisoner a Right to dispose of them . Mr. Buck . We do allow a Right to our Servants to sell . I am very certain to fifteen Yards of Damask , and five Yards of black Velvet being cut off our Pieces ; and I think , to the best of my Remembrance , there were our Marks on some of the Remnants . He owned before Colonel De Veil , that all these Things were our Property . I do not know whether it was through Madam Deson 's Means that he did this , she was indicted but the Bill was thrown out . These are the Patterns of the Goods laid in the Indictment , which Mrs Gost gave me . Mary Gost was examined by an Interpreter , she said she made a French Sack of the white Damask ; and four other Patterns of Lustring , & c. being shown her , she said she had made a French Sack of each of them for Madam Deson . Buck . The Prisoner owned the taking them before several Witnesses , and that Madam Deson had them . Q . Did he own he sold them to Madam Deson ? Buck . No ; he owned he gave them to Madam Deson . The Prisoner was acquitted , ( Vid . Ante , p. 107 , & c. ) and the Prosecutor had leave to bring another Kind of Indictment , but did not . 255. Charles Cole , of St Mary Islington , was indicted for stealing two Lambs , price 5 s. the Goods of George Sleith , April 2 . George Sleith . I live at East Barnet . I had two small Lambs stole out of the Church-Yard , the 2 d of April , about eleven or twelve o'Clock at Noon , and did not hear any Thing of them for a Week ; when I was informed that the Evidence , Howel , and the Prisoner , were seen with two Lambs at Holloway , I pursued them , and found Howel and Cole in Morefields ; they were very remarkable Lambs , and about a Fortnight old . Mary Smith . I live at Holloway ; one Saturday the Prisoner and Howel were at my House , and they had got two Lambs , one was alive and the other dead . I asked where they had them , and Howel said at East-Barnet ; they were about a Fortnight old . There came in two Butchers , and asked Howel what he had got in his Apron , he said two Lambs , and said he to Cole , Where had you these two Lambs ? and he said he bought them at Hitchin . Francis Howel . The Prisoner desired me to go with him to Mr Sleith 's House at East-Barnet , said that Mr Sleith 's owed him 38 s. and that he would come home the next Day ; when he was coming home , he said that he would have something for his Sunday 's Dinner ; and coming through a Church-Yard , the Prisoner saw two young Lambs , and took them up , and desired I would take them from him , which I refused , and he said he would stick his Knife into me if I did not ; so I was obliged to do it . Guilty , 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 256 + Gabriel Beaugrand , of St Anne Westminster , was indicted for the wilful Murder of Lewis Legier , by giving him one mortal Wound with a Knife , on the left side of the Belly , near the Navel , of the Breadth of half an Inch and the Depth of four Inches , of which Wound he instantly died .

Legier answered , he could not tell yet : Then Beaugrand asked the Cook , ( that is Legier , who was Commodore Anson 's Cook ) if he was a Brother Sailor , he said Yes , I am as well as you ; and Beaugrand asked him to shew his Hand , and when he showed him his Hand , Beaugrand said , Then we are Brother Sailors . Afterwards they began to talk about Ships , and who was most esteemed in the Ship , a Sailor or the Cook ; and Beaugrand said a Sailor was more esteemed than the Cook ; the Cook ( Legier ) answer 'd he was not more esteemed than him : Then there arose Words , and Legier said he would Kick Beaugrand ; and Beaugrand said , he did not know him yet ; and Beaugrand took a Pewter ( Pint ) Pot up , and struck at Legier , and then Legier flew upon him .

After Legier and Brunet engaged , they both came down upon the Floor together , so I went directly to see for the Watchman , and when I came back I parted them ; and when they were parted , Legier went to one side of the Table , and Brunet to the other ; then the younger one ( Beaugrand ) came up to Lewis Legier again , and gave him two or three Punches on the Belly thus - here on the left Side . Court . With what ? Pillet . I did not see any thing in his Hand ; I thought he fight de English Fashion ; so says I to them , Go home ; and then I heard Legier say , I am dead ; and fell down and died immediately ; when I said , Go home , I did not think he was hurt . - Legier went out with me , and Brunet came again to fight with him . Q . Was this in the Street ? Pillet . No , it was in our Passage . I turned Brunet into the Room again , before Legier fell down . Q . Where did Legier fall down ? Pillet .

Mr. Bermier examined by an Interpreter , his Evidence was , That between Ten and Eleven o'Clock , he went into Pillet 's House with Legier ; and there he found the Prisoners drinking ; that at first coming in , Legier and Beaugrand spoke to one another in English , which he did not understand ; and afterwards , that they spoke French , in a very civil , friendly Manner ; that he asked them , whether they were French , and the Prisoner said they were born at Calais , in France ; that talking about Sea-Affairs , Beaugrand , said , he was willing to go to Sea , but would not go in the Station of a Cook , because it was beneath a Sailor 's Dignity ; with that , Legier answered , that a Captain 's Cook was inferior to a Sailor ; but a Commodore 's Cook , was preferable to a Sailor ; with that , Beaugrand , gave him the Lye , and said , he was a lying Rascal , or some such Expression as that ; and that the Sailor , ( the Prisoner Beaugrand ) took up a Pewter Pot , and attempted to strike the Cook ( the Deceas 'd ) with it : Upon that , the Deceas 'd took hold of him , and pulled him over the Table ; laid him upon the Table , and took the Pot out of Beaugrand 's Hand , and struck him several Blows over the Head , with the Side of the Pot . Counc . Could not Beaugrand have hit Legier with the Pot over the Table ? Bermier . Yes , he could have hit him with it , if he had been very forward to do it . Counc . Why did not he do it then ? Bermier . Because immediately as he made the Motion to strike him , Legier fell upon him , and drew him over the Table . Counc . Was Beangrand fitting or standing when he made the Motion ? Bermier . He was fitting , before he made the Motion ; but when he made the Motion , he stood up ; and immediately Mr. Pillet endeavoured to part them , but could not ; and then he went out to get a Watchman , and when he came in they were parted ; and then , I said to Legier , Let us go home , is it possible that Frenchmen can fight so in a strange Country ; upon that , the Deceas 'd asked for his Hat and Wig , and when I gave him his Wig to put on , the Uncle ( Brunet ) made a Motion , as if he was going to strike Legier , and , in the mean Time Beangrand came up , and gave him a Stab . Court . Ask him whether he saw any thing in Beaugrand 's Hand , at the Time of his giving him the Thrust ? Bermier . No , I did not , for if I had seen any thing in his Hand , I would have prevented the Mischief . Court . Ask him if he knows whether the Deceas 'd had any Knife , when he came into the House ? Bermier . I do not know . Q . Where was the Wound ? Mr Bermier pointed to the left Side of the Belly near the Navel . - While he was putting his Wig on , I saw the Push made at him . Court . Ask him if he saw the Wound after the Man was dead ? Bermier . No . Counc . Did he look upon Beaugrand 's Head , to see what Condition it was in ? Bermier . I saw several Blows given him upon the Head , but I did not see the Wounds : - I saw him bleed . William Rawlins , the Watchman . I was called to Mr. Pillet 's House , between Twelve and One from my Stand ; and when I came in , I saw the Deceas 'd standing up against the Wall , supported by two Men . Q . Was Pillet one of the two Men ? Rawlins . No , Pillet was standing by , with a Candle in his Hand ; I asked the Deceas 'd , if he could stand , and he shook his Head , for he could not speak ; and in a few Minutes he dropped down . Q . Did he come to himself after he dropped down ? Rawlins . No , he lifted up his Hand once . I saw a great deal of Blood come out from about his Navel , and run over the Waistband of his Breeches . and my Brother Watchman lifted up his Shirt , and there was one Wound . Q . What Sort of a Wound was it ? Rawlins . It was a Sort of a pickedish Wound , and looked almost as if he had been blooded . Q . What , did it look like the Prick of a Launcet ? Rawlins . Yes , I think so . I asked where the Man was that did it , and they said there were but two Men in the House , and it was one of them ; and while I was talking , the Prisoners came rushing out in order to make their Escapes ; the old Man ( Brunet ) came running out , and said he would kill him by God . Q . Did he mention any Name ? Rawlins . He did not mention any Name . I turned about and said , Sir , you have killed him already ; then they went into a neighbouring Yard , and I and another Watchman apprehended them ; they had shut a Door against us , and I pushed hard against the Door , and the Latch flew open ; then I spoke to the Sailor , and said he must surrender , that he was my Prisoner , and he surrendered immediately . I was told the other was in the Bog-house ; I went to the Bog-house and told him he was my Prisoner ; he pulled out a Pair of Scissars , ( they were taken out of his Pocket afterwards ) but did not do any thing with them , he said he would kill all . We took them both to the Landlord 's House , and I found this Sheath and Fork under the Table ; there was a Knife that was bloody found the next Day in the Horse-pond belonging to the Prince of Wales 's Yard . - The Deceased had three Wounds . The Coroner produced a Knife with a sharp pointed Blade , about eight or nine Inches long . This Knife was found next Day in the next Yard , which can be proved to be the Property of the Prisoner . Counc . If a Man had a sharp Knife in his Pocket , might it not run into his Body by Accident ? Stephen Turner , Surgeon . I think on the 28th of April , between one and two in the Morning , I was sent for to the Assistance of the Deceased , to the Sign of the White-Bear in Newport-street ; I found a Man sitting upon the Ground , supported by the Chimney-Piece ; I examined his Pulse first , and found he was dead ; after that , I inspected the Body and found three Wounds , one within an Inch of the left Nipple , another within an Inch or two of the Cartilage of the Breast-Bone , about four Inches above the Navel ; and the third between the fifth and sixth Rib on the left Side ; the next Day I opened the Body , and found that the first Wound upon the Breast near the Nipple had penetrated to the Diaphragma ; the second entered into the Liver and Vena Cava ; and the third entered into the Cawl : It is my Opinion that the Wound given into the Liver was immediate Death ; that into the Lungs might have proved mortal ; the Consequence of the third Wound was dubious . Isaac Eterneau . I have not known Beaugrand long , but I have known the Uncle two or three Years ; about six in the Morning I heard there was a Man killed ; I went to the Round House and saw the two Prisoners handcuffed together , and Beaugrand had a Handkerchief about his Head ; and there were five Wounds upon his Head , the Pot had made Marks like Horseshoes ; one of the Wounds gaped so that you might put your Finger into it , he is not well of them yet . I have been in the Uncle 's Company five hundred Times , and have been out of Town with him , and played at Cards with him frequently , and never saw him in a Passion . I never heard he was addicted to quarrelling , or any malicious Action . Josias Hutchinson , Constable . There were five Wounds , all large Wounds , upon Beaugrand 's Head ; it was in a most terrible Condition ; the Blows were given with a good Will . Beaugrand guilty of Manslaughter , Brunet acquitted . [ Branding .

I laid hold of him and clapped Mr Tracy on the Shoulder , and said This Villain has picked your Pocket ; then the Prosecutor laid hold of him , and we brought him down the Steps into the Passage , in order to secure him ; we were forced to carry him to the Piazzas , and there there was a Mob rose upon us , and we had like to have been murdered ; as soon as we came to the Piazzas , he gave a Spring ( he is a deadly strong Fellow ) and threw my Hat and Wig off my Head , in struggling to get away ; at the same Time he pulled out the Handkerchief and threw it away , with Design , as I suppose , that we should take the Handkerchief and let him go ; then we got some Assistance , two Soldiers laid hold of him , and carried him into Mr Mitton 's at the Shakespear 's Head , when we had got him in there , we got some more Soldiers , and then we thought proper to send for a Constable , and he said if he took him into the Street , he would certainly be rescued from him . Mr. Rich said we should go through his House ; this was agreed upon , but the Mob arose , and fell upon us with Stones , Brickbats , & c. which they threw into the Shakespear 's Head to such a Degree , that we expected to have been murdered ; but Mr Rich was so good , as to let us , the Prisoner , and eight or ten Soldiers which came to our Assistance , into the Play-House , through his Ground , and there we were consined about an Hour , and durst not venture out all that Time , though we had the Soldiers with us .

There were a Parcel of Fellows who broke so many of my Windows , as I paid 39s . 4d . for mending , and had like to have been murdered ; there are such a Parcel of them that they will not let you stand at your Doors , if you do , you are in Danger of being murdered .

My Master bid me run after that Woman with the Basket over her Shoulder , and see whether she had got any thing ; I followed her , and saw the Hose under her Arm , I came running back to my Master , and he run after her , and I run after my Master , and overtook her just through the Gate upon London Bridge ; my Master brought her back to the Shop , and took from her ten Pair of Hose ; these are my Master 's Hose , I marked them myself . - Bennet . I saw Mr Dodson take ten Pair of Stockings from her in his Shop , which were wrapped up in her Apron under her Arm . Edward George , Constable .

On the 16th of November last , there was 26 Pound Weight of Chocolate stole from my Shop : I had Information that there were several Persons taken up , and one David Shields made himself an Evidence ; and John Read was last Sessions convicted of the Fact : I begged the Favour of the Court , to continue Shields in Custody , to be an Evidence against the Receivers of these Goods ; which the Court was so good as to indulge me in : David Shields was examined before Justice Rickards , and his Examination was taken in Writing . David Shields . On the 16th of November last , John Read , Emanuel Hubbard , ( who is since dead ) John Newman , ( who goes by the Name of Cutos ) and myself , lifted up a Grate belonging to Mr Taylor 's Shop , and took out 26 Pound Weight of Chocolate : - That was the Chocolate , with Relation to which I gave Evidence here last Sessions : We carried it to the Yorkshire-Grey , in Rag Fair , and set there some time with it ; and the other three staid there while I carried it to this Jane Johnson 's ( the Prisoner , who then lived in Cable street , but now lives at the Corner of Shorter street ; she has been an abominable Receiver for a long Time ) she asked me where I got it , which I was not very ready to tell her , but I told her , that I got it in Bishopsgate-street ; Oh ? said she , It comes far enough off , that I am not afraid of a Search ; she asked me how much I must have a Pound for it ; I told her , 18 d a Pound was the common Price ; she said , she would give me but a Shilling , I went and asked the rest of my Companions , whether I should take it or not , and they said no ; they always used to have 18 d. a Pound ; but as we did not know a proper Place to sell it at , they bid me go and take it ; and I had 26 s. of her for it , which is a Shilling a Pound . - She knew how I came by it , for I lodged in her House ; I saw her deliver the Chocolate in a Hand-Basket to one Isaac Aldridge , to carry it out , in order to sell it ; as I was sitting by the Fire , she showed me a Piece of Gold which she had for it , and said it was safe , for she had seen some Part of it melted down . - It was melted down because it was stamped . - This was the same Day that we stole it . Q . What is the Duty on this Chocolate , and the Value of the Chocolate ? Mr. Taylor . The Excise Duty is 18 d. per Pound , and the Value of the Chocolate besides is about 2 s. which in the whole , is 3 s. 6 d. per Pound . Elizabeth Davis . I live just by the Prisoner ; I lodged some Time in her House in Cable Street . - I lived there on and off about three Years . - I lived there when these Things were stole , but they were not brought there . Q . Then you know what Month it was that these Goods were taken . Davis . I know no otherwise than by their being advertised the 17th of November last . Q . Where did the Prisoner live then ? Davis . She was not at Home at her own House then - She was not to my Knowledge , for I did not see her . Q . What Time was it you called there to see whether she was at Home or not ? Davis . I was in and out every Day for a Dram . - Her Husband and her Mother kept the House . Q . For how long before this 17th of November might you be in and out every Day ? Davis . I seldom missed a Day going in , since I lived there . Q . Was the Prisoner there on the 17th of November ? Davis . She was not . - I can not tell whether she was there on the 16th . I knew a Man that came to her House sometimes , and he said he sold these Things to a Jew in Rosemary-Lane . Q . Did Shields lodge in that House at that Time ? Davis . I never was there all Night to see who lodged there . - I do not know he lodged there then , but he had lodged there . Q. to Shields . At what Hour was this that you went to the Prisoner 's House ? Shields . It was about eight o'Clock at Night . Davis . They have taken other People up on this Account , and having Money , they have let them go again ; and because this is a poor Woman , and has Children , and no Money to give them , she is taken up . William Downes . I know the Prisoner to have been at my House in November last , about the Middle of the Month . I am a Rope-Maker and work in Sun-Tavern-Fields ; I am a Man that goes out in the Morning , and does not come home till Night . - My House is at Mile-End . She came for the Air , and was so very bad at my House , that she laid down eight Hours in a Day upon the Bed together . - She was at my House about three Weeks . Q . Can not you tell what Day of the Month it was that she came to your House ? Downes . To the best of my Knowledge it was the 15th or 16th - I think it was not the 17th - I can tell by the Club that I belong to , which is every third Monday in the Month , and she came a Week before that Time . Q . What Day of the Week did she come ? Downes . To the best of my Knowledge it was on a Sunday . Q . Was it the Sunday before , or the Sunday se'nnight before ? Downes . It was the Sunday se'nnight before . Q . Are you sure of that ? Downes . I can not say to a Day , but what I have said I know to be true . Q . Were you out or at home when she came ? Downes . I was at home when she came . Q . Was she ill all the Time she was at your House ? Downes . She was ill all the while . Q . Now as she was three Weeks at your House , did not she when she was a little better go to Town . Downes . She never went out any farther than into the Yard . Q . How do you know that when you are at Work all Day ? Downes . Sometimes I come home and lie down for an Hour or two , for we can not make Ropes when the Sun shines ; and sometimes we work till nine or ten o'Clock at Night . Q . Do you work now till 9 or 10 o'Clock at Night ? Downes . Yes . We begin at 8 o'Clock at Night , and work till 8 in the Morning , and sometimes we work all Day if we can hold it . Q . Then if this be your way of working , how can you take upon you to say the Prisoner did not come to Town while you were out ? Downes . Because where I left her I found her : - I look upon her to be a very honest Woman ; I never heard any thing to the contrary . Susannah Downes . The Prisoner came to lodge at my Hou se the beginning of November . Q . Why do you think it was the beginning of the Month , more than the middle , or the end ? Downes . I think the Month was not above a Week spent . Q . Might it not be a Fortnight spent ? Downes . No , I am sure it was not a Fortnight . - She was ill , and came for the Benefit of the Air , and staid , I believe , 18 or 20 Days . Q . Did she pay for it , or did you receive her as a Friend ? Downes . She paid me half a Crown a Week , tho ' she did not eat a Shilling's-worth of Victuals - She used to be in my Room all Day , and lie down upon my Bed . Michael Hildridge . I have known the Prisoner almost ever since she was a Child , and I never knew anything laid to her Charge ; she has a great Charge of Children , and endeavours to get Bread for them in an honest Way . Edw Canwell . The Prisoner lives in my Neighbourhood , and behaves like a good Neighbour , she maintains her Family by buying and selling old Cloaths in Rag-Fair , is in the same Way of Dealing as I am . Nobody will say any thing to the contrary of her being an honest Woman , unless those People who carry on the Prosecution . Acquitted .

I sold her the Remainder 2 Pair of Candlesticks , and 9 Papers of Buckles for 11 s. she bid me put them into her Apron , and go to the Door , and see if nobody was there to see her come out ; she keeps a very bad House - there are none resort to the House but a parcel of Boys who go out a robbing and picking of Pockets ; there are some of them in my Information , - there are two Rooms on a Floor , 2 or 3 Beds in a Room , and 3 or 4 of these Boys lie in a Bed .

Mr. Gilling . The Day before yesterday , a little after six in the Evening , I locked the Compting-House at the Mansion-House , that is now building for the Lord Mayors , ( I belong to Mr Dance ) I left the Things mentioned in the Indictment in a Drawer in the Compting-House ; when I went in the Morning I found the Door open , and the Drawer laid upon the Floor ; I immediately missed the Things , and in the Afternoon one Draper told me that a Man had sold a Gold Ring to Mr. Wallis , at the Red Lion in Wentworth street , Spital-Fields ; I went there with Draper , and Mr. Wallis said he had bought a Pair of Gold Buttons , and had paid twenty Shillings for them , that his Wife had them , and he would not let me see them without paying him the 20 s. and I did pay him 20 s. for them - The Prisoner was then at Mr Wallis 's House , and pulled a Pair of Silver Spurs out of his Pocket , and said that they were given him by one Martin ; he said he found the Buttons in the Minories , but when he came before Justice Peck , he said that Martin gave him both the Buttons and the Spurs . Harry Wallis . Yesterday Morning between nine and ten o'Clock , as I was standing at my Door , the Prisoner came by , and another Neighbour with him , he said Mr Wallis , See what a Find I have got to-day , I have found a Pair of Gold Buttons ; and said , that when he picked them up , he would have sold them for a Shilling , but a Gentleman coming by said they were Gold ; there was another Labourer with him who saw him pick them up ; but I am apt to think he dropped them himself , and then pretended to find them . I asked him what he would do with them , he said he would sell them , and said they were worth a Guinea and an half ; I said I would give him what a Silversmith would give for them ; a Neighbour 's Man weighed them , and they weighed 20 s. 9 d. and I gave him 20 s. and a Pot of Beer for them ; he said he found the Buttons in the Minories , but that Martin gave him the Spurs . Andrew Martin . The Morning after the Robbery , my Master Gilling was saying he had lost such and such Things , and I desired he would look after this Fellow ( the Prisoner ) whom we call Shock ; at Dinner-Time , Draper came and said he had taken Shock , and that he had the Gold Buttons . I went with Mr Gilling to Mr Wallis 's , and found him asleep ; we examined into the Fact , and he denied stoutly , and said he did not care a Pin for the Gentleman . Thomas Draper . I was going yesterday Morning ong the Poultry , and heard that the Compting-House had been broke open , and that Mr Gilling had been robbed . I happened to go into Mr Wallis 's , and there was the Prisoner ; said Mr Wallis , I have bought two Pair of Gold Buttons of him , and paid him the Money for them I saw the Prisoner was full of Money , said I , The World is well mended with you . I told Mr Wallis I knew the Owner of them , and desired him to take Care of the Prisoner , till I went and fetched the Owner , and he secured him till I fetched the Prosecutor . Richard Quait . A Woman brought a Ring yesterday to my Shop to sell , I questioned whether she came honestly by it ; said I , I must step this Ring ; and then she said she would fetch the Owner : the Prisoner came and said he found it in Cheapside ; said I , It is a Thing of Value , and I must stop it and advertise it , which accordingly I did ; the Prisoner said he would call again , and away he run . The Buttons , Spurs , and Ring were produced , which were sworn to by the Prosecutor . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 279.

Henry Crisp . The Prisoner lived with me as a Footman near half a Year . About three Weeks ago , a Constable came to me with the Evidence , and said he had been at a Pawnbroker 's , with a Silver Spoon , the Crest a Griffin ( which is my Crest ) upon which the Constable , two other Men , and myself , went , by his Direction , and found the Shirts at two different Places . This was on the Information of George Ogden . George Ogden . I have been acquainted with the Prisoner about a Quarter of a Year ; the beginning of April , I was at Mr Crisp 's and the Prisoner gave me a blue and white Linnen Handkerchief ; I asked him what it was for , he said , it was something that he had taken in part of a Debt : There was in the Handkerchief two very fine Dimitty Waistcoats , one Shirt , and two Stocks ; he said , if I could dispose of them , I should have half for my Pains . I carried the two Waistcoats and the two Stocks to Mrs Kitteridge , in Bow-lane , she asked me , how I came by them ; I told her , an Acquaintance of mine had taken them for a Debt ; she desired I would take Care , and not bring myself into any Premunire ; and I sold the Shirt to Mrs Palmer for ten Shillings ; I gave George Sutton , 5 s. out of the 10 s. which I had for the Shirt : George gave me a Handkerchief with two other Handkerchiefs , and two Shirts in it , which he said he took of the same Person , for part of the same Debt ; I carried these to Mrs Kitteridge , said she , I wish you are not got into ill Company . and said , if I was and did not come honestly by them , she would not have them for the World : So I told her where the young Man I had them of liv 'd , and his Master 's Name , and left them with her ; and I sold Mrs Palmer another Shirt , which was bran-new , for 10 s. and there was a Woman who keeps an Herb-stall gave me 1 s. for one Handkerchief , and 10 d. for the other ; another Time he gave me a Silver Spoon , and desired me to dispose of it ; I showed it to a Pawnbroker , the Pawnbroker look 'd at the Spoon and said here 's a Crest upon it I must stop the Spoon ; he charged a Constable with me . Mr. Makepeace , the Constable . On the 3d of May I was charged with this young Fellow [ Ogden ] on Account of this Spoon being stopped at a Pawn-broker 's , on Suspicion of its being stole ; I told him I would not part with him , unless he would let me into the Affair , I said it is a Family Spoon , and if you will not tell me who it belongs to , I will go to the Heralds-Office and there I shall find it out ; then he told me it was Mr . Crisp 's ; I went to Mr Crisp 's , and found there had been a farther Robbery , and then by Ogden 's Direction I found 1 Shirt and 2 Waistcoats at Mrs Kitteridge 's on Garlick Hill , and 2 Shirts at Mrs Palmer 's in Huggin lane , and the 2 Handkerchiefs I found at a Greens-shop , and they were all surrender 'd very readily . [ The Things were produced , and owned by Mr Crisp . ] Richard Peake , for the Prisoner . At the Time this Evidence was taken up , I heard a Cry of Stop Thief ; I stopp 'd him , and he own 'd he had robbed Mr Crisp , and said that he was the principal Person that took away these things from Mr Crisp 's , he own 'd he took the Spoon , and the rest of the things , unknown to the Prisoner ; he said he us 'd to do odd Jobbs for the Footman or Servant-Maids ; he said he took the things while the Prisoner and the Servant-Maids were playing in the Garden . William Elson . May 3 , in the Morning , I was standing just by my Door , I saw Ogden and a Woman coming down Cloak lane , there was a pretty hot Dispute between them , but he went from her , and she cried Stop Thief ; I asked her what he had stole ; she said he had stole a Silver-Spoon ; I told her she would not be safe without detaining the Man , for it was a Family-Spoon by the Crest ; so she sent for Mr Makepeace and charg 'd him with him ; and he confess 'd the taking the Spoon without the Knowledge of the Prisoner . Mrs Walker gave the Prisoner a good Character . Acquitted . 280.
