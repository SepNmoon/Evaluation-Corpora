Richard Gibbins thus depos 'd , Coming from Hackney between Kingsland and the Cok , I bore a Lanthorn before my Master , and I heard some Horsemen , as I thought , advance towards me , when they came up they viewed me , and as soon as they came to the hind Wheel of the Chariot , they fir 'd a Pistol , shot the Coachman in the Arm , and he died this Morning ; when they had shot , I heard them cry out , your Money , Sir , your Watch and Rings ; my Master said nothing , I stood close with my Lanthorn , and Johnson was by me , the Horsemen took the Money , and Johnson held a Pistol to me , and bid me Dismount ; I look 'd at his Face , and he looked as if he would let off the Pistol in my Face , and that would have been very hard indeed ; so I got , or rather tumbled off my Horse , and he said to the other , Get up , Get up ; the other got upon the Horse , rid away , and turned him up at the Turnpike , and the Saddle and Bridle were lost - Keys came on Tuesday Night to Mr. Brown 's at Stoke Newington , and confessed the Robbery , going home that Night with Mother Mare , I met Mr. Brown , and he told me of it , and asked me to go to his House - It put me into a Tremble , and I was going Home for a Stick , but that I thought it might fright my Wife ; so I goes without , and saw Keys , and he said he was one of the three that Robb 'd my Master - I would not believe it , he said he was , and said , if I had had a Blunderbuss I had Died , for they view 'd me well , and more then that he would kill my Master ; and since I was so great a Man with a Blunderbuss , he would kill me if I offer 'd to take him , and wish 'd he had Johnson with him . Johnson was the Man that held the Pistol to my Head , the Man on Foot was a civil Fellow , and I said 't was pity to take him - I see Johnson afterwards in Newington Town when 't was almost Dusk , and he but just turn 'd his Face , and I knew him ; I confin 'd Keys in the House , and carry 'd him to my Master , and then before Justice Cook , who committed him to Newgate .
