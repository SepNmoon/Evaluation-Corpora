See summary . ] John Parson , of St. Martin 's Ludgate , was indicted for feloniously stealing divers pieces of Silk to a considerable value , in the Shop of Sone Nichols and William Byard , the 8th of February last ; to which Indictment the pleaded Guilty . Eleanor Gallimore of St. Andrew 's Holbourn , was indicted for the Murther of Richard Pugh , an Infant of ten Months old , by not allowing it sufficient Meat , Drink and due Attendance , by which Means it languish 'd from the 23th of January to the 12th of February , and then died . It appeared by the Evidence that the Prisoner was a Parish-Nurse , and had five young Children of different Ages to keep ; and that she took two Twins , of which the Deceas 'd Richard Pugh was one , for the which she contracted with the Father for 10 l. to take them for good and all . The Mother of the Child deposed , That she had been an unfortunate Woman and had Two Twins , who were by the Father of them taken from her and put to Mary Gallimore upon the Condition before-mention 'd , and that he would give her no Account where they were to be , but that she Follow 'd them when taken from her , and went to the House , but Gallimore would not permit her to come in ; that she went afterwards several times and she would not let her in , and that she heard frequently the Children crying vehemently , and the Door lock 'd up and she out of Doors , and no body to look after the Children ; and that when she went and Gallimore was at home , Gallimore always hector 'd her , threatned her , forwarn 'd her of the House , and would not permit her to visit them and see how they were look 'd after . This was confirm 'd by other Evidence , who added , that she would go out and leave the five Children for half a Day together , and sometimes stay out all Night a drunknaing , and use the Children cruelly ; and that when the Child Richard Pugh died , one Evidence deposed she went in and found the Child wrapped in a piece of an old Rag and laid under the Dresser ; but none of the Evidence did say that she used any violent Methods to make the Children away . The Mother likewise added , that when the Child was dead , all the back Parts of it were in a sad Condition , locking like an Ox Liver parboil 'd . And on the other ha nd , she on her side produced some Persons who said that when Gallimore was out she left them Victuals & c. and that she had used to feed them , turn them dry , & c. And although it did appear she had been negligent , yet there was not Evidence to support the Indictment , which was laid for Murther . The Jury considering the Matter , acquitted her . John Wiltron , was indicted for privately taking 30 s. the Money of Thomas Edwards , the 18th of December last . The Prosecutor 's Wife deposed , That the Prisoner was her Husband 's Servant , having served an Appenticeship and was then Journey-man , and that she had taken Notice that oftentimes when he took Money in the Shop he put his Hand to his Pocket , and did suppose that he put the Money in his own Pocket ; upon which she order 'd the Money-box to be brought to her , that when Change was wanted he might come to her . But it happening some small time after that she finding several of her Goods in the Custody of a Servant-Maid , she taxing her with her Dishonesty , the Maid replied there was a greater Thief in the House than she , naming the Prisoner ; whereupon she putting the Matter home to him , he did at last confess that he had at times taken to the Value of about 4 l. The Prisoner upon his Tryal denied the Fact , and called a great many Persons to speak to his Reputation , who gave him an extraordinary Character for Honesty , and that his Master had also done so several times , intimating that he having a design to set up his Trade , had given his Master Warning , who then ow 'd him 25 l. and the Day he was to come away this Accusation was fixed upon him . However the Jury found him Guilty . Hugh alias John Coleman , alias John Davis , alias Hugh Roberts , was indicted for Polygamy ( i.e . marrying several Wives ) and in particular for marrying Amy Parker the 29th of October last , and for marrying Susanna Payn the 1st of January last , Amy Parker being still alive . Susanna Payn prov 'd her Marriage , adding , that she being Cook at the Three Tuns Tavern in Gracechurch-Street , the Prisoner used to come there , pretending to be a Master Carpenter in great Business , had his Gang attending who personated his Workmen whom he made a Show of paying them Wages , and who used to talk about Business ; and others who personating such as were pressing upon him to do work for them ; That he carried her to Fleetditch and show 'd her 25 l. worth of fine Furniture which he told her he had bought ; That having appointed a Day to be married he told her they were to be married at St. Paul 's ; that he carried her to the King 's Arms Tavern on Ludgate Hill , and that a Person came out of the Fleet Prison to marry them ; and upon her refusing to be married there , he used Some constraining Methods , and they were married . She proved her Marriage in Court . She also said , that after he had got some Money of her he sent her a Letter to get her Things packed up , and her Money out of her Master 's Hand , in order to go along with him ; but she having then got some Account of what Villainous Tricks he had plaid in that Nature , had she Grace to disobey his Orders , and after got him apprehended . She said that when he was in the Compter he did acknowledge he had had an Hundred Wives , and were he at Liberty he would have an Hundred more . It is likewise said , that he had fourteen Wives who were Cook-Maids . There were three of his Wives present in Court at his Tryal standing all in a row ; but the first of their Names not being in the Indictment , that did not affect him ; and when the Marriage with Amy Parker came to be proved , the Evidence seeming to be looselaid , left them in the Lurch and so that Indictment miscarried likewise ; but the Court had been so well appriz 'd of his Villany in marrying of Women and getting what they had and then leaving them , that they advised the Wives to provide themselves with better Evidence , till which time he was to be secured . Ferdinando Paleotti , Esq ; alias Ferdinando Marquess de Paleotti , was indicted for the Murther of John Niccolo alias John the Italian , the 11th Day of February last ; he was indicted likewise for Manslaughter upon the Coroner 's Inquest ; and also on the Statute of Stabbing . After the Council for the King had opened the Cause , the Evidences gave the Accounts following : John Johnson deposed , That he having been out was come home and knocking at his Master 's ( Esq ; Ballasis ) Door in Lisle-Street , between nine and ten a-Clock at Night ; he saw the Marquels and the Deceased pass by and heard Niccolo say , Tous les Jours ; and having passed him while he stood knocking , he perceived the Prisoner pursue the Deceased with something in his Hand held up , and heard the Servant in a violent manner cry out , Garde , Garde , Garde , near ten times , and then took hold of a Post ; and the Prisoner walked by with something under his Arm , but whether Stick or Sword he could not say positively , but did believe it to be a Sword ; and the Marquess being gone past him , Niccolo never spoke more , but fell to the Ground ; and then the Marquess took to his heels and made up Gerard-Street ; upon which he and Thomas Corbridge , who came upon the Out-cry , examin 'd the Street , and were positive that there were no Persons in the Street at that time but the Marquess and Niccols , and himself knocking at his Master 's Door ; and that there being some Lights reflecting , and himself being in the Dark , he had so perfect a view of the Marquess 's Face , that he was sure he was the very same Person , and swore postively to it . He added likewise , that as well as he could then distinsguish , he had on a Red Coat . The Prisoner pretending he could not speak or understand English , had an Interpreter allow 'd him , who being sworn . told the Marquess in French what the Evidence said in English ; and the Court bid him ask the Marquess if he would ask the Witnesses any Questions ; whereupon he ask 'd him what colour 'd Clothes he had one who said to the best of his Judgment , Scarlet . To which he reply 'd very angrily , That whatsoever he had deposed was all Lies ; for he had no Red Coat on that Day , and that he would anon disprove all he had said . The next Evidence was Thomas Cambridge , who deposed , That as he was knocking at a Door in Leicester-street he heard an Out-cry , which he took to be Mother ; and running to Lisle-street he saw a Person of the same Stature with the Prisoner pass by him , but he could not swear to his Face , but by his Stature and make of his Body ( which was pretty remarkable , he being a tall Man ) he did verily believe it was the Marquess : that seeing the Man dead , they look 'd and saw no body in the Street at that time but the Marquess , the Deceased and themselves . Margaret Clay deposed , that She being at a Window that looked into Lisle-Street , Saw a Gentleman and his Servant pass along , and immediately heard the Footman cry out violently , and immediately the Footman fell down dead near the Lady Bellasis 's Door . John Rucks deposed , That as he was at his Master 's ( Esq ; Elmys ) House in Lisle-Street , he heard a Noise and Out-cry in the Street , and running up Stairs heard a Man groan at Esquire Bellasis 's Door , and saw a tall Man pass by him , and no other Person in the Street ; and that by Shape and Stature he did verily believe it was the Prisoner the Marquess ; and that when he passed by , Niccolo was fallen on the Ground . Benjamin Forster deposed , That he hearing the Out-cry as he was at home in Lisle-Street , ran out , and that then there was no body to be seen in the Street , but a Gentleman that came down the Street keeping the Coach-way , and that he had either a Sword or Stick under his Left Arm , and his Right Hand upon it ; and that he was in Red Clothes , and that as he passed along hastily he turned back several times looking behind him as it were , to see if any Body followed him , and turned up Gerard-Street ; that by his Stature and Shape he verily believed the Marquess to be the Person ; that then stepping to the Deceased , be and another found him dead , and opened him to find his Wounds ; and examining his Pockets , they found some Papers by which they discover he belonged to the Marquess de Paleotti ; and that the Deceased had in his Pocket one Shilling and one Penny . William Spicer deposed , that he living at St. James 's kept a Sutler 's House , and that the Marquess had for some time been his Lodger , and that he was always want to come Home pretty late , and have a Supper and much Attendance , and his Room illuminated and a Fire in it ; but that Night he did not see him come in ; but was told by the Maid , who went up Stairs between ten and eleven a-Clock , that the Marquess was in Bed , though none in the House knew he was at Home . Elizabeth Newman confirmed what her Master had said ; adding , that she going through the Marquess 's Room to put her Master 's Grandchild to Bed , she not thinking the Marquess to be there , he put back the Curtains and ask 'd for his Man Niccols ; to which she answer 'd he was not come home ; and that he reply 'd that he was , for he had put him to Bed ; and told her several times that he was asleep in some Chair in the Room . She added , that neither she , nor any of the Family , knew he was come in ; and that he got into Bed without the Bed being made , without any Candle , or any Fire that could give any Light . Mr. Spicer added , That the next Morning the Marquess got out of Bed , and knocking he went , and when he came the Marquess asked him for his Man Niccolo ; to which he reply 'd , he did not come in that Night . And that just about that time one Mr. Belon came and told the Marquess that Niccolo was found murthered ; upon which in a sort of hurry of Mind , he went to dress him , and called for his Grey Clothes , which he fetched him ; then he dressed himself and went out : and as it appeared , went to the Bilhop of Salisbury 's ( very probably thinking to find Sanctuary in the Bishop 's House , as in a Church or Cloyster in Popish Countries ) where it seems he behaved himself so rudely , making a sort of a Riot . that his Sword was taken from him , and sent to Justice Gore 's ; which Sword was produced in Court by John Martin the Constable , who had received it of Justice Gors . John Wilkinson deposed , That he had lived four Months with the Marquess as his Interpreter ; that the Marquess that Day went out in the Forenoon with Niccolo , and that he had on Scarlet Clothes turn 'd up with Blue , and that Sword which was produced in Court ; and said that he had not had while he was with him any other Sword but that . Mr. Dubasamel deposed , that after the apprehending of the Marquess de Paleotti , be discoursing with him in the Guard-Chamber , he told him that on the 11th Day of February his Servant John Niccolo was with him on the other side of the Water , and that they returning in the Afternoon he went to see a Lady and supp 'd with her , and his Man Nicccalo waited on them at Supper , and that he went to wait on the Lady home , and she would go through a dark Alley , and he would not go with her : that Niccalo went with him almost home , and that then he lost him ; and that he went into his Lodging and went to Bed by 10 of the Clock . Mr. Dubasamel said , upon this he told the Marquess , that the Account he had given his Landlord , & c. which differ 'd from what he then said , would be made use of in Court against him : upon which the Marquess chased , and in a Haughty Air reply 'd , What , did he suffer himself to be interrogated by such a one as he ? and fell to kicking of him . John Stephens , the Surgeon , depos 'd . That being sent for to view the Deceas 'd he found the Wound was 7 Inches deep and a quarter of an Inch broad ; that it penetrated into the Left Lobe of his Lungs and into the Heart , and was satisfied it was the Cause of his Death , and that the Wound was not given with a hollow Blade , but with such a Sword as was produced in Court , and sworn to be the Prisoner 's . The Marquess when he came to make his Defence , having an Interpreter allow 'd him ( who was sworn for that purpose ) pleaded total Innocence as to the Murder of John Niccalo , saying , he had no Ill-will against him , nor had any Cause ; and if he had , he had another way of punishing him , which was by Martial Law , he being his Servant and a Soldier of his own Troop . He then owned they did go out together in the Morning ; that they went to the other side of the Water , and coming back in the Evening went to a Tavern near Lincolns Inn Fields and supped , about 8 of the Clock ; that they went away together , and Niccalo went along with him as far as home , and asked him at the Door to let him step some where and he would return presently , so he went to bed without Niccalo 's putting him to bed , and never saw him since . Being ask 'd by the Court , why he told the Maid that Niccalo put him to bed ? He denied he ever said so . Being ask 'd by the Court how he came to go so suddenly to bed without Attendance , Light , Fire , or his Bed made ? He answer 'd there was a Fire that gave him Light , and that the Bed was made . Tho ' the Maid being examined again as to that Matter , she swore the Bed wasnot made , nor was there any Fire that gave any manner of Light . But at last he grew unsatisfied with his Interpreter , affronting him , so that he frequently desired the Court to excuse him from the Office , saying , that he did not like him because he did not make an Appearance great enough for him . But the Court being very well satisfied with his Capacity for the Office , thought it needless to do , till at last by the unhandsome Carriage of the Prisoner , and the frequent Request of the Gentleman who they had appointed to be his Interpreter , they did condescend to gratify them both , and prevailed with a Worthy Justice of the Peace to humour the Marquess so far as to be his Interpreter , with whom he seemed to be a little better pleased , and made the Defence following . That had he not been innocent of the Murther of Niccalo , he would not have staid to be taken , for that his Sister the Dutchess of Shrewsbury sent him 50 Guineas and some Jewels to have made his Escape , and added , that when he and his Man came from the other side of the Water they went to the Tavern in Lincolns Inn Fields , and that there he sent out for some Gentlewomen , and that he went along with them in a Coach , and being about half way his Man Niccalo desired him to let him go somewhere and he gave him leave , and he never saw him since . And some other Questions being put to him by the Court , he said he did not know what became of his Man ; for the People of the Tavern in Lincolns Inn Fields well knew that his Man Niccalo was enquired for there , and went away , and they knew better what became of him than he did . And thus he contradicted himself three or four several times . At last he would have and his Tryal put off , saying , he had not had time enough to produce Evidences , but was answered by the Court he had sufficient Notice , having been committed fourteen Days , and that he himself had desired the Court by Mr. Lorrain that his Tryal might be brought on at that time . Upon the whole . his Defence being trifling and contradictious , the Jury considering the matter , brought him in Guilty of wilful Murder , the Coroner 's Inquest , and Statute of Stabbing .

I James Davis , at his Majesty 's printing House in Black Fryars , was about seven Years ago seized with a violent Fever , which settling first in my feet , and then flying into my Hand , and all over my Body , attended with a prodigious Swelling and inflamation , made me uncapable of getting out of my Bed for several Months , and so has continued ever sure , excepting some small Intervals . I had the Adv ice of several eminent Physicians and Surgeons , who by the various removings of my Distempers , knew not what to call it , yet order 'd me Medicines , but to no Purpose . About three Years ago I went to St. Batholomew 's Hospital , and was an Out Patient several Months , where the Physicians told me it was violent GOUT , but could have no Ease . Having thus had the Advice of the Learned without Success , I began to hearken to every bodies Instructions , sending for and taking all the Medicines I could hear off . And as the Expence was large , so was their number I think innumerable , which only added to my Misfortune , not hearing of any Person so violently afflicted as my self . Being in this miserable Conditions , and given over by all articurable , the Gout still increasing so violently , that my Joints became so Knitted , that I was render 'd quite unable to follow my Business , and difficult to all some time ago , I was recommended by a Gentleman to the Anti-Arthritick Medicines mention 'd in a new System of the GOUT and RHEUMATISM , gives gti Up one Pair of Stairs at the Sign of the Anodyne . NECKLACE , without Temple-Bar . I had not taken above two Days before I found a great Alteration . The GOUT , which was then in my Stomach , abaied , and by a Continuance of those Remedies I still grew sensibly better every Day : so that I am now free from all Pains and Suffress in my Joints , and as well in Health and Strength as ever I was in my Life . This Benefit I have received by God 's Blessing : and those i e. inable Remedies being so very great . I desire this may be published for the Good of others .
