James Castle . About 4 or 5 o'Clock , August 5 , I was carrying a Bundle of Mr. Stepple 's Things to the East-Ham Coach ; the Prisoner met me in Whitechapple , and asked me if I did not come out of Thames-street ? I told him no ; then he enquired if I was not going to the East-Ham Coach with my Bundle ? I said , - Yes . You 'll be too late , says he , the Coach is just going off , and so he snatched the Parcel from under my Arm , and away he ran with it , and turn 'd up Gulston-street . I follow 'd him , and cry 'd Stop Thief ; upon which several People pursued him , and he threw down the Bundle , in hopes of making his Escape , but he was taken in Gulston-Square . I am positive to the Prisoner , because he was not three Minutes out of my Sight . Q . Was he carry 'd before a Justice of the Peace ? Castle . Yes ; and I was present , and charged him with taking the Things , but he did not say any Thing to excuse himself , as I heard . Prisoner . Ask him whether he did not give me the Bundle to carry for him ? Castle . No ? he snatch 'd it out of my Hands . Q . Where does the East-Ham Coach stand ? Castle . At the White Hart and Three Tobacco Pipes , in Whitechapple . Q . When he had got the Bundle from you , did he run towards the Inn ? Castle Yes , he ran a little Way towards the Inn , and then he cross 'd the Street from the Inn , and ran up Gulston street . Prisoner I walked a little Way before him , - pray , ask him why he did not immediately cry out - Stop Thief ? Castle . Because I thought he might belong to the Inn , 'till I saw him run out of the Way . George Rawlins . I was going up Gulston-street , on the 5th of August , and heard the Boy ( Castle ) cry - Stop Thief . I turn 'd to see what was the Matter , and the Prisoner was just then at my Elbow . As he ran , he threw down the Bundle , so I call 'd out - Stop Thief , and though he run very fast , yet the People took him at the Corner of the Square . I am very positive the Prisoner is the Man that was taken , but he flew so swiftly by me , that I could not then take any particular Notice of his Face . I said to him , - you Rascal , how dar 'd you take the Bundle from the Lad ? why , says he , I did not design to run away with it ; this was his Answer , as near as I can remember . Robert Wilcox . I happen 'd to be in Gulston-Square at this Time , and seeing the Prisoner runing along , without either Hat or Wig , and hearing People cry Stop Thief , I took hold of him , and held him 'till the Boy and the other Witness came up . He had nothing upon him , when I seized him , for ( it seems ) he had thrown the Bundle away before I saw him . Defence . I was walking along , and met the Boy very hard loaded ; I asked him how far he was going ? He told me he was going to the Ham Coach . I told him I would help him ; so he gave me the Bundle to carry for him ; but I had not gone far , before I saw some Bailiffs following me , and considering that I owed a Man 5 l. I flung down the Bundle and took to my Heels : upon which the Boy cry 'd out , - Stop Thief , and these People took me . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 2 . Matth.ew Jones , was indicted for stealing 16 lb . of Sugar , value 3 s. 6 d. the Goods of William Coleman , in the Parish of St. Butolph Billingsgate , August 26 John Weldon . On the 26th of August , I was going up into the Buildings upon ButolphWharf , and in the first Story I found the Prisoner running away from a Hogshead of Sugar . I saw something in his Apron , so I seized him , and found his Apron and his Right Pocket full ; we weighed the Hogshead , and found 49 lb . wanting ; sixteen Pounds we took out of his Pocket and Apron , and upon comparing it with the Sugar in the Hogshead , it prov 'd to be the same . He told me it had been given him by a Sailor , and begged I would let him go ; but I took him into the Capsel Room to my Partners , and they sent for a Constable . The Sugar belonged to one Mr. William Coleman . Prisoner . Ask him if I was in my Senses , and if I was not so fuddled , that I could not stand : Weldon . I really ca n't say whether he was or not ; he appeared a little in Liquor , but most of us thought he only shamm 'd it . Adkins More , Constable . I was sent for to take Charge of the Prisoner , and the Sugar that was found upon him . I asked him how he came by it ? He said a Cooper had given it him , and that he only went up into the Buildings to pick up a few Hoopsticks ; but at last he rapp 'd out an Oath , and bid Weldon take Care what he did , for he could not swear he saw him take it . He shamm 'd being drunk , - but so he has done very frequently upon the Keys . I have seen him with something in his Hat-several Times upon the Wharfs , and have had several Runs after him , but could never take him 'till now . Prisoner . I know nothing of it , and my Witnesses are all dead . Guilty Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 3 , 4.

Frances Marlborough , was indicted for stealing 200 weight of Lead , val . 20 s. fixed to 3 Messuages belonging to Thomas Wakelin and John Gillings , in the Parish of St. Paul Shadwell July 30 . John Gillings . I charge the Prisoner with taking the Lead from the top of the Houses , on Saturday Morning , the 30th , of July . Two of these Houses are empty ; they stand at the lower end of Foxes lane , near Pelican-stairs , Shadwell . I was call 'd out of Bed between 2 and 3 o'Clock in the Morning , and found the Lead carried about 16 Feet from the Place where it was fixed , and just ready to be thrown down . A Witness . I ca n't say any Thing to the Prisoner 's taking the Lead , but hearing the Noise that Thieves were upon the Top of the House , I went up , and saw the Lead ripp 'd up , and the and the Prisoner behind the Chimnies . I endeavoured to take him and he dodg 'd me round the Chimnies , but at last he said , if I would not hurt him , he would surrender . The Lead was mov 'd 16 or 18 Feet from the Place where it was fix 'd . Another I was on board a Ship hard by , but hearing the People say , a Thief was behind the Chimnies , I came ashore with a Staff 6 Feet long , and a Ladder being raised against the Houses , I went up , and asked the Prisoner what he did there . What 's that to you says he ? Come along say 's I , and immediately I seized him , and brought him down . There was about 2 hundred Weight , roll 'd up and carry 'd to the Corner of the House , just ready to throw down . Q . When did any of you see the Lead fix 'd ? Gillings . We see it almost every Day . Defence . I came from Shadwell Market to these Houses , and the Street being all in an Uproar , I asked what was the Matter ? The People told me , that somebody was stealing Lead from the Tops of the Houses ; so I went up the Ladder to help them take the Thief , and when I was upon the Top of the House , that Man came up with his Staff and knocked me down . A Witness . I was the Man that set up the Ladder ; I was the first that went up , and there was no Person upon the House but the Prisoner . Gillings . I help 'd this Man to raise the Ladder ; the Prisoner never went up the Ladder . - I believe he got in at the Cellar-Window of an empty House . Margaret Tyler . I have lived 5 Years next Door to the Prisoner ; he is a quiet Neighbour , and never would be Drunk , - no , never of a Sunday in all his Life , but would go to Church . As to this Affair , I know nothing of it , - the Man 's a Bricklayer by Trade . This very Day the 29th of July , I sent him with two Rabbets to Poplar ; he return 'd to our House between 8 and 9 o'Clock at Night , and 't was half an Hour past One before he left us . Q . And what then ? Tyler . Why I never heard any ill of him in my Life . Q . To the Prisoner . You say you are a Brick-layer , where are any of your Masters , for whom you have work 'd ? Prisoner . I work 'd for one William Killet , a Bricklayer in Ratcliffe-Highway , but he is not here I believe . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 6. Eleanor Adams , of St. Andrew 's Holborn , was indicted for stealing a Gold Ring , value 11 s. a Silver Spoon , value 4 s. 6 d. and 5 . Guineas in Money , the Property of Joshua Howard , in his dwelling House , July 16 . Joshua Howard . The Prisoner liv 'd 3 Weeks with me as a Servant ; on the 18th of July , in the Morning , she went away , - before my Wife was up . Her going away in this Manner made me suspect she had robb 'd me , so I search 'd about the House , and I miss 'd 5 Guineas , a Silver Spoon , and a Gold Ring ; they were lock 'd up in a corner Cupboard . Q . Was the Cupboard broke ? Howard . No ; therefore I suppose she had a Key which would open it ; or she might watch her Opportunity and take our Keys . Q . When , and how did you take the Prisoner ? Howard . I was informed she was at Islington , so I went there , and met her last Sunday Night near the Green Man , in the Road to Holloway . I charged her with the Robbery , and told her she must go with me ; she said , she had not meddled with any Thing , but as we were coming along , she owned that she had taken two Guineas . I got a Warrant for her that Night , and carry 'd her before a Justice ; there she own 'd she took the Spoon out of the Cupboard , and had laid it upon a Shelf in the Shop , upon which the Justice committed her to Prison . On-the Tuesday , the Justice would have had her to have sign 'd her Confession , but she refused . She told us , that she had taken the two Guineas one Morning when my Wife was gone to Covent Garden . We are both of us out every Morning about two Hours ; she goes out with Fruit , and I with Milk . Howard 's Wife . A Neighbour having informed me , that my Maid liv 'd extravagantly when I was abroad , I suspected her to be the Thief ; so I enquired into the Affair , and I found out this Mrs. Victor , her Acquaintance . Mrs. Victor had receiv 'd a Guinea from the Prisoner , to buy Shifts and Aprons . Upon this , I taxed her with the Robbery ; - She wished sad Wishes , if ever she was Mistress of a Guinea in her Life : ( this was one Night when we were going to Bed . ) I told her I would enquire farther into it next Morning , but next Morning , when I got up , - my Maid was run away . Ann Victor . I did not know any Thing of her having any of Howard 's Money : - 't is true - indeed , - she did give me a Guinea to buy some Linnen for her ; and she told me it was Part of her Wages , receiv 'd at a Place in the Country ; but a Fellow-Servant where she had left her Cloaths , having run away with them , she must desire me to lay out that Guinea in Linnen for her . Q . When was all this ? Victor . This was within a Week after she came into Howard 's Service . I saw she had 2 Guineas more , ( at that Time ) and some Silver . Mrs. Howard . The Prisoner own 'd , that she took the Money out of a Horn Cup , two or three Days after her first coming to us . Defence . I am very Innocent , - I was frighted when they took me , and did not know what I did Q . But what was the Reason that you ran from your Service in so abrupt a Manner ? What do you say to that ? Prisoner . I was frighted , - and so I was , when I was before the Justice . Mr. Howard . She was never threaten 'd at all ; she confessed voluntarily where the Things were . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7. Elizabeth Campbell , of St. Andrew 's Holborn , was indicted for stealing a green Silk tabby Gown , faced with red Damask , value 3 s. and a Bermudas Hat , value 2 s. the Goods of Jane Knolton , August 24 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 8. William Kitchinman , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing 5 Pieces of Printed Callico , value 10 l. - the Goods of a Person unknown . July 4 . Peter Movillion . These are 5 Pieces out of 12 , which we lost out of our bleaching Grounds , the 23d of June last . We could get no Information concerning them a great while : but at last I heard of a Woman , who knew something of them . The Prisoner at that Time , worked at Mr. Gerrard 's , and he having a Ring of this Woman 's , she came to enquire after her Ring ; the Prisoner told her he had some Pieces of Printed Linnen , and desired her to get some Money upon them : One Mr. Vincent over-hearing this Discourse , informed me of it , and I found out that Woman , the next Witness . The Goods were found in the Possession of one Grace Adkins , but she is secreted . These Pieces now produced , are Part of the Goods taken from the Bleaching Grounds ; they are not half finished , or whiten 'd , nor are half the Colours in them which they should have . Q . Why do you lay them as the Goods of a Person unknown ? Mr. Movillion . Because they have cut of the Marks at the Ends of the Pieces , by which we know every Man 's Goods . Mary Skreen . The Prisoner at the Bar about 4 Months ago , took a Ring from me , and when I went to him to ask after my Ring , he told me he had 7 Pieces of printed Linnen to dispose off , so one Day he brought the 7 Pieces to me , and desired me to get him 7 Guineas upon them , if you can do it says he , I have 4 Pieces more , and I will bring you them too ; I told him I could not raise the Money ; then he asked me if Grace Adkins could , and while we were talking of her , who should come in but Grace her self ; I did tell her of these Pieces of Linnen , but indeed , my Lord , I did not ask her to lend the Money upon them . Grace told the Prisoner , tho ' she could not lend so much Money upon them , yet she would borrow it , and she did so , and I saw the Money paid to the Prisoner , and the Goods deliver 'd to Grace . I did not take Notice of the particular Time , but I think it was about a Month before the Prisoner was taken up . - Hold , - by Recollection 't was about the 25th of July , and there were 6 Pieces then pledged to her . She ( Grace Adkins ) lives at 'Squire Clark 's at Spring Gardens Q. Pray what 's become of this Grace Adkins ? Skreen . I did not see her for a Month after the Goods were pawn 'd to her , not till the very Night that the Prisoner was taken up ; then she produced the Goods , and she fell out and quarrell 'd with me for saying any Thing about them . Q . What 's become of Grace now ? Skreen . I do not know indeed . Mary Powel . Grace Adkins borrow 'd the 7 Guineas of me , which the Prisoner had upon the Goods ; she was to pay me again . I never saw the Prisoner before that Time , when Grace paid him this Money for the Pieces of Linnen , but I never saw them open 'd . Skreen . This is one of the Pieces that he then deliver 'd . Mr. Movillion . I took the Goods at Grace Adkins 's Lodgings , the 24th of July . Clement Webb , Constable . These are the same Goods which were deliver 'd me at Grace Adkins 's Lodging ; and she own 'd before the Justice that they were the very same which the Prisoner brought to her . At the Watch-house he told us , he bought them of a Scotsman , one John Johnson , who traded to Holland . These are the same Pieces , - here 's 4 whole Pieces , and 2 half Pieces . Skreen . He brought first 2 Pieces - then four ; and one of them he redeem 'd the Night before he was taken up . Prisoner . If I may be indulged 'till to Morrow Morning I will bring my Witnesses . Q . Where 's this Grace Adkins ? Prisoner . I do n't know , she 's a Stranger to me . Q . To Skreen Has the Prisoner used any Endeavours to get you out of the Way ? Skreen . Grace Adkins came to me about 4 Days after the Prisoner was sent to the Gate house , and told me , if I would go there to him , he would give me my Ring ; so I went to him , and he told me , if I would not appear against him , I should never want Money or Friends . I said I would take Councel upon it , and accordingly he sent me to his Father 's Agent , and he told me I might get off with Ease , and that drawing ( withdrawing ) the Cullisses ( Recognizances ) would not cost above 14 or 15 s. I had set my Mark to one of the Peices , and his Sister came and begg 'd me not to Swear to that , because it would save his Life . C To the Prisoner . Your Trial was put off in the Morning , because your Friends were not come , who were to give an Account how you came by this Linnen ? Prisoner . They are not come yet . C. If you have any Witnesses send for them , you shall have an Hour allow 'd you . The Prisoner was taken from the Bar , and allow 'd an Hour 's Time to produce his Witnesses , but none appearing he was put upon his Defence . Prisoner . I did not buy these Goods , I had them of one John Johnson , who Trades over Sea ; I met this Man one Day , and I went with him to the White Swan Ale-house at Holborn-Bridge , and he ask 'd me to get him 7 Guineas upon them ; I carry 'd them to Skreen 's for him , and she produced Grace Adkins . Constable . He told me he bought them of Johnson , and that he had bought Goods of him , and sold them several Times . Mr. Movillion . The Prisoner was a Servant to another Printer , and he and his Brother went suddenly from their Places upon such another Affair . Q . Have you no Body here from the Swan , where you say this Johnson deliver 'd you the Goods ? Prisoner . No . Constable . Why , he told me himself , that he knew the Goods were not finish 'd . Skreen . Adkins told me the Prisoner offer 'd to sell her 2 Gowns at 5 s. a Piece , and that she had bid him 4 s. 6 d. The Prisoner was then in Company with us , - we were all drinking Tea , and in Discourse , Grace said , she would have the first Man that asked her the Question . The Prisoner asked her if she would have him ? Upon my Faith ( says she ) I will ; upon which they both went to Merlin's-Cave at Charing-Cross , and there the Prisoner tore off enough Linnen to make her a Gown , and made her a Present of it , to bind the Bargain . I have seen several Gowns upon the People 's Backs , which Grace Adkins had sold for him . The Court allow 'd the Prisoner 2 Hours more to send for his Witnesses ; after which , Mr. Norton , and Mr. Lutwych appeared . Lutwych . The Prisoner 's Sister gave me Money for Councel and Subpoena 's against to Morrow . Norton . I am the Prisoner 's Father 's Agent , and the Prisoner used to bring me a Guinea now and then to send to his Father , for he said he thought it his Duty to help him in his Need , as long as he was able , and I commended him for it . The Prisoner has work 'd 3 Years in Whitster 's Grounds , and I never heard ill of him before . Lutwych . I gave Subpenae 's to Mr. Dottery and his Wife , but I did not imagine his Trial would have been 'till to Morrow Mr. Movillion . Mr. Dottery is the Prisoner 's Brother-in-Law , and he told me positively , that he should not care to appear at the Old-Bailey for him . Joseph Jarvis . I am Servant to Mr. Watson a Printer , the Prisoner was under me , and he behaved well till latterly : 't is 3 Years ago since he worked with me first . About the Time that I complained the Grounds were robb 'd , he went away , and never bid me God b ' w ' y . Q . What was the Cause of his going away ? Jarvis . I do n't know . Q . Upon your Oath did not Mr. Watson turn away 2 Servants for being Acquaintances and Accomplices of his ? Jarvis . Yes , he did . A Woman . I know the Prisoner to be an honest Man ; I have known him some Years , and I never knew any Thing but good Behaviour by him . Q . Are you any Relation of the Prisoner 's ? Woman . Yes , I am his Sister . He bore a very good Character , both in the Country and here ; Mr. Dottery would have appeared for him , but he 's not at Home . Guilty Felony only . [ Transportation .

Jacob Kendall I charge the Prisoners with breaking open a Door , and robbing me of a Pewter Bason and Dish , and other Things , between 3 and 4 in the Morning ; they had moved 3 Sauce-pans , 2 Stew-pans , and a Tea-kettle , in order to carry them off . The Door they broke was adjacent to the Kitchen , and was lock 'd fast . The Pewter Dish and Bason they had carry 'd off a good Way . - I swear they were in my Wash-house between 3 and 4 in the Morning . John Bundry . I was going to my Labour about a quarter before 4 in the Morning , and I saw Mr. Kendall 's Door open , and the Prisoner Howard coming out . I observ 'd him to put his right Hand back and pull too the Door , so I went up and asked him what he did there ? Then he pretended to be making Water , within a Yard of the Door : I pushed it open and saw the Stew-pans and Sauce-pans , and the Tea-kettle , all ready to be taken off . I saw nothing of Harrison , but Howard I took particular Notice of , and observ 'd that his Hands and Face were crock 'd and black 'd . John Sanders . I am a Baker , and live exactly against Mr. Kendalls . The Morning he was robb 'd I was up at Work , and as I was opening my Window , I saw the Prisoner Harrison at Mr. Kendall 's Wall , with something like a Bundle under his Arm . He pretended ( when he saw me ) to be making water too , so I went to my Work , but in about half an Hour , my Wife bid me go and see what was the Matter at Mr. Kendall 's ; when I came there , I found they had got Howard ; and Harrison coming in , to enquire what the Disturbance was , I told the People that I had seen him about half an Hour ago , with a Sack full of something under his Arm ; upon which Mr. Kendall detained him with the other . Q . The Things that were remov 'd , and lay ready to be carry 'd off , - where did they stand over Night ? Kendall . In my Wash-house . We found the Things again which they had carry 'd off , in King Harry 's Yard , not far from my House . Sanders . While I was telling Mr. Kendal that I had seen Harrison with a Sack under his Arm , some People came in with one which they said they had found in Maudlin 's Rents , in a Dust Cart , and the Goods in it proved to be Mr. Kendall 's . Prisoner Howard . I know nothing of the Man 's Goods being stolen : I was going to the Hermitage , and stopping at Mr. Kendall 's Door to make Water , a Man rushed out of the House , and went by me . Bundey . When I saw Howard turn as if he intended to make Water , there was no Body at all passed him . Howard . As to my Hands and Face being crock 'd , I had been mending a Hole in a Porridge-pot for a Woman , who is here in Court , and she gave me 6 d. for doing it . C. This is a notable Evidence ; as it happens she can not swear you was at another Place . Margaret Cannon . Howard ( the Prisoner ) liv 'd with me about 3 or 4 Months , and kept very good Hours . The Morning this Thing happen 'd , I let him out ; the Watchman ( as I shut the Door after him ) went - past 3 o'Clock ? I heard no more of him 'till I heard he was in Trouble . Q . How far is your House from Mr. Kendall 's ? Cannon . I live in Church-Lane , Whitechapel . Mr. Kendall 's is about a quarter of a Mile from thence . Howard . There is the Woman whose Porrige-pot I mended , and crock 'd my Hands and Face in doing it . Eliz Vaughan . I have known the Prisoner Howard since Whitsuntide , and know no Harm of him . Howard . Ask her , my Lord , if I did not mend her Porrige-pot that very Night ? - 'T was an Iron Porrige-pot , and I had 6 d. of her for mending it . Vaughan . I am upon Oath , and ca n't say any Thing I do n't know , - no , - upon my Oath , I know nothing at all of it . Frances Radwell and Mary Ann Collier never heard any Thing ill of him before . Daniel Pickering . Howard serv 'd his Time with me very well : he buys and sells Pewter ; - he has dealt in Pewter a pretty while . C. That seems to be true : 'T is sworn upon him here : Tho Colcott . I know no Harm of him ; only this - he will get Drunk and bring himself into Trouble . Q . Does not he deal in Pewter ? Colcott . I do n't know what he deals in , - not I. Harrison 's Defence . I never was guilty of such an enormous Crime in all my Life . I am a Seaman , and I came here in the Contrivance , Capt . Franklin . The Night this Thing happen 'd , I had been drinking at the Newcastle upon Tine , at the Hermitage , with some Seamen who were to help me to a Birth ; I came from thence past Mr. Kendall 's Door , and seeing the Hubbub , I just put my Head in to see what was the Matter , and so they seized me . Q . To Sanders . Was not that the Man you saw with the Bundle under his Arm ? Sanders . Upon my Oath 't is the same Person . Kendall . Harrison says now , he is a Sea-faring Man ; when he was before the Justice , he said he was a regular bred Parson , and had worn Canonical Robes . They both said then , they lived in Petticoat-Lane , and had liv 'd there 3 Months . Harrison Why , I served my Time indeed at Sea , but I was brought up and educated at Eaton College .

The Prosecutor not appearing , though several Times call 'd , the Prisoner was discharged , and the Court order 'd the Recognizances to be estreated . 13. John Daffon , was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on Richard Daffon , ( in the Peace of God and our Lord the King then being ) did make an Assault , and with a certain Knife made of Iron and Steel , value 2 d. which he the said John in his Right Hand held , to him the said Richard did cast and throw , and him the said Richard on the right Part of the Back above the Bone of the right Hip did strike , giving him a mortal Wound of the Breadth of one Inch , and the Depth of one Inch ; of which mortal Wound in the Parish of St. Clement Danes , he languished , and languishly lived from the 6th of July to the 24th , and then and there died . He was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for feloniously slaying the said Richard Daffon . Mr. Pitt , Surgeon . The Misfortune happen 'd on Tuesday or Wednesday the beginning of July . I was sent for immediately , and found the Deceased wounded in the Back , and a large Blood Vessel belonging to the Kidneys being cut , there was a great Effusion of Blood ; but upon dressing him , it stopp 'd . I attended him 3 Times , and then he was so well , that I order 'd him to come to my House to be dressed for the future ; and during that Time , he grew so well , that he went out of Town to his own Place , ( to Chiswick ) I was apprehensive he would go to work too soon , therefore I cautioned him against it , and advised him to live regularly , and not to use any Exercise . The Week following , I was obliged to go out of Town , but the Deceased was then in so good a Way , that I told him in 2 or 3 Dressings he would be well . When I came Home again , I heard he had been abroad with some Fidlers , had got drunk , that there had been a Flux of Blood , and that he was in a Fever , which I believe was the Occasion of his Death . The Monday before I took him to be quite out of Danger . Q . Was the Effusion of Blood any Cause of his Death ? Mr. Pitt . No , for we lost no Blood from the Time of dressing him first , till he was guilty of this Irregularity . Q . Might not the Fever have occasioned his Death without this Wound ? Mr. Pitt . I can not take upon me to say the Wound occasioned his Death , his Fever was very violent . Q . What Business was the Prisoner ? Mr. Pitt . A Fisherman . James Powel . The Deceased and his Partner were at Work , and a Gentleman , the City Marshal , came and took their Net away ; so the next Day they went to see if they could beg it of him again ; then they went to the Hat and Feather in Milford-Lane , and sitting down at a Table , the Prisoner said to the Deceased 's Partner , - come do n't be dead-hearted for one Net , - let 's have a Pint of Beer and drink , for I am very dry . The Deceased in a mouthing sort of a Way , swore , - damn you , you want to get drunk all Day , - you shall have no more , and he order 'd the People to bring none . The Prisoner upon this took up a Knife , and dash 'd it on the Table , and it slid to his Son ( the Deceased ) and gave him the Wound . Q . Did he dash the Knife upon the Table , or at his Son ? Powel . He dash 'd it in a Passion down on the Table , not at the Boy . William Wells . The Deceased and I were at Work together on the Wednesday , and our Net being Seized , we went together to see if we could get it again . We found the Net was not to be recover 'd ; so as we were returning , the Father said to me , Come do n't mind the Net , - Shall we have a Pint of Beer ? I said , Aye , with all my Heart ; but the Son said , - you are Drunk enough already , and bid the People not bring any more . Upon that , the Prisoner catch 'd up a Knife , and accidentally dash 'd it on the Table , and it bounc 'd against his Son 's Side : The Prisoner at the same time cry 'd , - Must I be rul 'd by my Children , and be afraid of having a Pint of Beer ! - Sanger . I have known the Prisoner twenty Years , a very honest , peaceable , quiet Man ; if he had any Fault , 't was being rather too indulgent to his Children Another Witness spake much to the same Effect . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and found that the Son died of a Fever . 14. Sarah Macguire , of St. Sepulchre 's , was indicted for stealing a cloth Coat , val . 10 s. the Goods of Samuel Wood , August 4 . The Prosecutor not appearing , the Prisoner was Acquitted , and the Recognizances were order 'd to be Estreated . 15. John Walker , of St. Stephen Coleman Street , was indicted for stealing 6 pewter Plates , val . 3 s. the Goods of Richard Cox , August 29 . Richard Cox . I keep a Publick-House ; on Monday the 29th , of August , the Prisoner came in between 1 and 2 , after Dinner , and call 'd for a Tankard of Beer . I pass 'd to and fro ' in the House , while he was drinking his Beer , and at last some body call 'd me out into the Street : I look 'd back and saw the Prisoner go towards the Necessary-House in the Yard . When I went in again , I met the Prisoner coming out : I observ 'd his Coat was then button 'd up close , when he came in it was open . Here , says he , take your Reckoning , ( and he gave me a Shilling ) if a Man in a green Coat should come to ask for me , tell him I am gone . But seeing something button 'd up in his Coat , I pull 'd it open , and found these Six Plates upon him . I carry 'd him before Sir Richard Brocas , and there he own 'd he took them , and said he did it out of Necessity , - and the like . Defence . My Lord , there was a young Man with me , and it was he that gave me the Plates : Says he to me , there are some Plates in the Yard , we 'll have half a Dozen of them : I bid him let them alone , but he would take half a Dozen , and then he gave them to me , and I put them in my Bosom . - Here Mr. Cox , you did not give me my Change out of the Shilling , I gave you for the 3 Pints of Beer , I hope you 'll give it me now . Cox . Aye , - Here 's your Change , - and I thank you for leaving the silver Tankard behind you . Guilty [ Transportation . See summary . ] 16. John Totterdale , of St. John the Evangelist , Victualler , was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. August 1st , on Mary his Wife , did make an Assault , and with both his Hands , in and upon the Stairs of his dwelling House , the said Mary did cast and throw down , and she on the Stairs so lying , he , the said John did drag and pull down to the Bottom ; and her the said Mary , from the Bottom of the said Stairs , into a certain Room in the said House , did cast and drag , and the said Mary so lying on the Floor , he , with both his Hands and Feet , her Head , Neck , Breast , Shoulders , Back , Sides , Belly and Thighs did strike , kick and stampt upon ; giving her , as well by throwing and dragging her down the said Stairs , as by stricking , kicking and stamping upon her , several mortal Bruises , of which she instantly Died . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Daniel Brown . I lodged in the Prisoner 's House when this Fact was committed . On the first Day of last Month , I went Home a little before five . ( The Prisoner keeps a Victualing House in Vine-Street , Westminister , the Sign of the Two Brewers ) All then was very good humour 'd ; the Deceased was in a Room with two Women ; she seemed to be a little in Liquor , but that I do n't Mind . I sat down and drank with some Company in the House , and the Deceased went out , - but where or how , - I ca n't tell ; that is , I did not Mind ; - for why ? - It was none of my Business , - but she did go out of the Room , and was out a Quarter of an Hour . I sat down and talk 'd with this Woman here , she 's a Witness too , - and I saw the Prisoner take a Knife and Fork , and he went up Stairs , - as it happened , - but indeed it was more than I knew . After the Prisoner had been up Stairs a little while , says the Woman here , ( Margaret Phillips ) Lord - Brown , there 's a great Noise in your Room . Well , says I , if there is , fight Dog , fight Bear , and the Devil part you ; I have parted you too often already , for the Woman told me Totterdale was beating his Wife . But presently I heard , - Murder , - Murder , in a soft , faint Tone ; so upon that , I ran up Stairs , and found the Prisoner standing at the Chamber Door , and his Wife laying on the Floor ; he was stamping upon her , and kicking her , - I saw him stamp 2 or three Times upon her as she lay upon the Floor ; but I got hold of the Knife and Fork and took him down Stairs . I look 'd upon the Knife to see if it was bloody , but I saw none upon it . The Prisoner staid some little Time below Stairs , and in the mean Time , my Wife went up , and convey 'd the poor Woman into my Room , and then I thought all was over ; but instead of that he went up Stairs again . I follow 'd him , and when we came to my Chamber-door , he asked me where the Key of my Door was : I told him I did not know . He then bid me ask my Wife for it , and said , if I would not give him the Key , he would break the Door open , - but I would not suffer him to break it open . Upon this he went down and fetch 'd a Key , with which he open 'd the Door , his Wife was sitting upon my Bed 's Feet and the Curtains were drawn over to hide her . When he first went into the Room he could not find her , so I wav 'd my Hand to her , - to bid her get away ; but whether she was then able to stir or no , I ca n't tell ; she did not go , and the Prisoner discovered her , and asked her where the Cap was , which he had given her ? 'T is below Stairs Johnney , says she . You lye , says he , - indeed Johnney , says she , you lye for a Bitch of a Whore , and immediately flew at her : I caught hold of him , but he kick 'd her and sprung out of my Arms , and then he caught hold of her Feet , and dragg 'd her by the Heels , off the Bed upon the Floor ; then he drew her to the Stair-head , and threw her down , - I do n't know whether 't was Head-foremost or not , but she fell about 7 Stept 's , and there she lay . I was so surprized , and so frighted , that I turn 'd back and went into my own Room , and there I staid three or four Minutes ; then I went down and found the Prisoner had got the Deceased into his own Room , and had bolted and barr 'd himself in with her . I heard the Deceased in this Room cry , - for Christ 's sake Johnney ! Johnney for Christ 's sake do n't kill me ! 'T is true , the Door of this Room was but a very Slight Door , - only Slit-deal , but I was frighted and could not break it open , so I went out of the House for an Hour and a half , and when I came Home she was Dead . Brown 's Wife . I had been abroad the 1st of August , but I came Home about Two o'Clock , and went into my own Room . I had not been there long , before I heard a Noise in the next Room , I open 'd the Door and found the Prisoner was beating his Wife , he asked her for a Cap , she said it was below , and upon that he went down Stairs . When he was gone , I call 'd Molly , Molly , come hither ; so I got her into my Room , and draw 'd the Curtains over her to hide her , and lock 'd the Door . About 5 o'Clock the Prisoner came up and open 'd the Door , he look 'd about the Room for her , and at last pull 'd open the Bed-Curtains ; then he took her by her two Legs , and haul 'd her off the Bed upon the Floor , and as she lay , he stamped upon her Head , Belly , Stomach and Legs , and after he had stamped upon her , he kick 'd her all to pieces , and flung her down Stairs ; then he dragg 'd her into their own Room , and lock 'd himself and her in . I thought they were gone to Sleep , so went out , - but when I returned , the Woman was Dead . The Surgeon . The next Day , or the 2 d Day after the Woman was kill 'd , I view 'd the Body . Upon the external View of the Corps , I saw so many Marks of Violence , that put me upon being careful and inquisitive in my Search , I turn 'd the Body on one Side , and found two or three Ribs fractured . There was a Stab in her Right Arm , that went into the Joint ; it was 4 or 5 Inches deep , and seemed to have been made with a Knife . The Instrument went under the Nerves , and so happen 'd to cut no Blood Vessel . Upon opening the Body , I found nine Ribs fractured ; two or three of them were broken in 3 or 4 Places ; one in two Places , another in 2 or 3 , another was mash 'd all to Pieces ; two whereof were beat in , upon the left Kidney . I observ 'd something farther , which was very particular . There was one Rib in the Middle of broken ones , that was not fractured at all ; which convinced me , that the rest were broke at several Times , and I imagine with the Heel of his Shoe : for if those that were broke , had been fractur 'd by any Instrument , which would broke more than one at a Time , it would have been almost impossible that this single Rib should have remained unhurt in the Middle of the fractur 'd ones . This Treatment occasion 'd her Death ; and 't is my Opinion , that if but one of her Ribs had been fractur 'd in the Manner that 3 or 4 of them were , it would have been impossible for her to have liv 'd . A Woman . I happen 'd to come on the 1st of August to the Prisoner 's House to speak to Margaret Phillips ( my Cousin ) and he was then in a back Room where he lies o'Nights . We call 'd for a Pint of Beer , so he came out and drew it for us , and was in a very great Hurry for the Money . Then he went backward into the Yard where he keeps Hogs , and returning , he comes to us , - and damn you , - you Phillips , ( says he ) where 's my Bitch ? I do n't know , says she , unless she is among the Hogs in the Yard . You have hid her in your Room , says he , and immediately he took up a Knife and Fork and went up Stairs . I heard a great jumbling after he was got up , so says I , Phillips , how can you sit here , and not go up ? If I go up , says she , he 'll run the Knife into my Guts . The jumbling continued a little while , and then I saw the poor Creature come tumbling down the Stairs , and her poor Head came knock , knock , knock , upon every Stair , and he kick 'd her ( all the Way down ) upon her Breast , Belly , & c. When she was at the Bottom , he dragg 'd her into a little Room , and lock 'd himself in , with her ; she was not dead then , for I heard her cry faintly , - Oh ! - Oh ! Pray do n't beat me any more ! Oh ! - Oh ! - dear Johnney , Johnney , do n't ! do n't ! I could hear him very plainly , - thump , thump , thump upon her . Another Woman that was in the House went to the Door and knock 'd , but he would not open it , at last the Poor old Mother she came , and call 'd at the Door , Johnney , Johnney , but no Johnney would speak ; then she went round to another Door and got in ; but she immediately came out crying I 'm undone ! undone ! undone ! Upon this , I got up and peep 'd in , - and there was the Poor Woman , - dead , - and her Jaws were ty 'd up with her Cap . Margaret Phillips . I can speak out , - in an honest Cause . Just before she dy 'd , ( the same Day ) he sent her out to see if she could get a Debt of 5 s. which he never expected to receive , and I ( having occasion to go out , ) met her , returning with the Crown : She told me she had got the Money , and that her Johnney would give her a Judas 's Kiss for it . I came back with her , and he kiss 'd and embrac 'd her , as if it had been the first Day they were Marry 'd . My Cousin and I were drinking a Pint of Beer , and while we were together he went out into the Yard , and when he came back , he ask 'd us , where his Bitch was , - There he stands , he ca n't deny it , - Your Bitch , says I , why your Bitch is in the Yard among the Hogs , I believe ; for I thought he meant a Bitch that he kept , and had had Puppies by . Then he took a Knife and Fork , and as he went up Stairs , I said , What do you mean your Wife , by your Bitch ? - God mend me , - You have been just now Kissing her . Aye D - n her says he , I 'll do for her , and went up Stairs with the Knife and Fork . I saw him throw her down Stairs and stamp upon her . Q . Did you see him do any Thing to her upon the Stairs ? Phillips . No ; but when he had dragg 'd her into his own Room , I peep 'd thro ' the Key-hole and saw him stamping upon her , as if he would stamp her Guts out . She dy 'd in about an Hour from the Beginning of the Affair . A Woman . I know nothing of the Murder , but I went next Day to the Gatehouse , and I said John , John , What have you done ? I have kill 'd your Sister says he ; the Devil drove me up Stairs to her , and when I had kill 'd her , God would not give me Power to run away . A Soldier . I was going to see the Races on the 1st , of August and met my Wife , she told me Totterdale had Murder 'd his Wife : No , no , say , I , he has only half Murder 'd her , as he frequentsly did : However , I went to the House and would have gone in , but a Miss he kept forced against me to keep me out of the House , D - n you , you Bitch says I , would you hinder me from coming into a House where Murder has been committed ? So I threw her against the Wall and went into the Back-Room , there I saw nothing ; but going into the Yard , I look 'd in at a Casement which was open , and there I saw the Prisoner . We got a Constable , and he asked him whether he did the Murder ? The Prisoner only said , he could not help it . Prisoner . I know no more of it , than the Child unborn . Q . To the Prisoner . Have you any Witnesses ? Prisoner . They are not come yet . Coroner . He has an own Brother hard by ; but neither his Mother , nor Brother will appear for him . Guilty , Death . 17. Ruth Woodward , was indicted , for that she on the 5th of February , in the 3d , Year of his Majesty 's Reign , at the Parish of St. Helins , Married William Woodward , and afterwards , to wit , on the 9th , of August last , feloniously Married Robert Holmes , her former Husband being in full Life . Mrs. Calloway . I was at the Prisoner 's Wedding , when she was Married to William Woodward , 't is about 7 Years ago , and they were Married at Great St. Helens Church . He kept a Publick House and she liv 'd with him about 7 Years . John Hall . And I saw her Married at the Fleet to Robert Holmes ; 't was at the Hand and Pen , a Barber 's Shop . Counc . And is it not a Wedding Shop too ? Hall . Yes . Q . And who was the Parson ? Hall . I do n't know the Person 's Name ; but 't was a Man that once belonged to Creed-Church . Q. Pray how came you to be at the Wedding ? Hall . I was coming from Work , and was asked to go in and Drink . I knew very little of Holmes , but I have known Ruth the Prisoner many Years . Q . Was you the Parson 's Assistant ? Did you stand for Clark ? Hall . No ; I know nothing of the Parson ? Q . How dost know he was a Parson ? Hall . I do n't know - he had a black Gown on , and I believe , I have heard him Preach at Creed-Church , about 7 or 8 Years ago : I asked the parson himself if he had not , and he said , he had belonged to that Church . Q . Was you present all the Time the Ceremony was performing Hall . Yes . C. What , you was Father I suppose Hall . Yes , Sir . Q And how long ago is it , since this Honour was conferr 'd upon you ? Hall . 'T was the 9th , of last Month . Coune . What sort of a Man was the Parson ? Hall . A very lusty jolly Man . Counc . Because there 's a Complaint lodged in a proper Court , against a Fleet Parson , whom they call the Bishop of Hell . Counc . The Man had a black Gown on , and 't is not incumbent on us to shew he was in Orders . Prisoner . I never had but one Husband , and that ' Woodward . C. But here 's Hall that says he was Father , when you was Married at the Barber 's Shop . Prisoner . I 'm sure if I was , I was so much in Liquor , that I remember nothing about it . Q . Why do n't you remember you was at the Barber 's Shop , - the Hand and Pen . Prisoner . No ; I was very Drunk . C. Drunkenness is no Excuse in Law , for any Crime . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 18 , 19. Richard Franklin , and Dorrel Smalt , were indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling House of Richard Walker , about the Hour of 12 in the Night Time , and stealing thence 12 Yards of leaden Pipe , and a brass Cock fixed thereto , val . 38 s. the Goods of Richard Hoare , and Thomas Smith , June 4 . Richard Sanders . This Man ( Joseph Smith ) came and surrender 'd himself to me , in order to make himself an Evidence for the King ; and he made an Information before my Lord Mayor of Several Thefts and Street-Robberies , in which he had been concern 'd with the Prisoners . Joseph Smith . On the 3d , of June last , the two Prisoners Franklin and Smalt , met at Tom Gale 's House ; 't is a disorderly House in Black and White-Court in the Old-Bailey , for the entertainment of lewd Women . We came thither from Smalt 's House , and we staid at Gale 's 'till about 12 at Night . Smalt keeps a House in Fleet-lane himself , for the harbouring of such People , and there I became acquainted with him and Franklin . While we sat Drinking at Gale 's , Smalt said he wanted Money , and Tom Gale told Dorrel that he was informed , that he ( Dorrel ) had taken to the Lead-Lay , and that he understood that Lay very well . Says Dorrel Smalt , yes , I formerly went out on that Lay , and my Custom was to walk the City and Suburbs in the Day Time , and observe where Cocks and Pipes were fixed ; the Places I used to set down , and at Night I went and took them up . He ( Smalt ) asked me and Franklin , whether we would go and rob an adjacent House of a Pipe that was there ? It was a House inhabited by one Richard Walker , a Printer . We agreed , and accordingly about 12 , we went out of Tom Gales House and got into the Yard ; then we broke down a Partition next to the Ground Floor of the House , and by that Means we got into the House : this Partition joins to the House , and is a part of it . Q . Was it a Part of the Wall of the House ? Smith . 'T was a boarded Partition , and join 'd to the House . Q . Why do you call it a Partition ? Smith . It parted the House from the Alley . Q . Was it the Fence of the House it self ? Smith . No . Q . How did you get into the House ? Smith . By breaking down the boarded Partition : Part of the Pipe was in this boarded Partition . When we had broke into the House , we took the Case off the Pipe , and cut away about 2 Yards , or 2 Yards and a half , with the Brass Cock in it , and we carry 'd it to Tom Gales . Q . How did you get out of the House again ? Smith . The Way we got in . Q . What part of the House was the Cock and Pipe in . Smith . On the Ground Floor . Smalt and Franklin went into the House , and I watched in the Yard . Q . What did you do with the Lead ? Smith . We broke it to Pieces at Tom Gale 's House , and then we carry 'd it to Smalt 's Room , in Black-Boy Alley in Chick-Lane . The next Night , the 4th of June we met at Gale 's again , and about 12 at Night we went to the same House and took up the Frame of the Cellar Window , Bars and all ; then the 2 Prisoners went in thro ' the Window , and brought out of the House the remaining part of the Pipe . The whole that we took was about 12 or 13 Yards , and Smalt sold it to one White , who liv 'd next Door to him . I have enquired after this White , and I hear he is dead . Q . What was it sold for ? Smith . Smalt said he could get no more than 4 s 6 d. for it , and that we shar 'd among us . I made my self a voluntary Evidence , and according to my Directions , the Constable went to Smalt 's House , and found 2 Pistols loaded , in a Box under his Bed : they were Joe Emmerson 's Pistols , and were given Smalt by Sarah Holmes , who belonged to Mac Cray 's Gang . John Jenkins . I am a Barber in Black and White Court . The Cock and Pipe which they stole served me with Water , and I know there is so much lost as is laid in the Indictment . The House was broke open twice , but the particular Times I ca n't tell . I have always had a Suspicion of that Franklin the Sailor . Q . How was the House broke ? Jenkins . There was a Board thro ' which the Cock came , and the first Night that Board was broke down , and the Cock stole . The Board was about 9 or 10 Inches wide , and 2 Foot , or 2 Foot and a half high ; if that is removed , any Person may enter side-ways . After this , the Frame of the Cellar Window was taken away , with all the Bars , and , as much Pipe as to come to 12 Yards . Mr. Porter in Turn-again Lane was the Plumber that put the Pipe down again , and he charges 38 s. for 12 Yards of Pipe and a Cock . I know they used to be frequently at this Gale 's , and he kept a disorderly House . I have seen the Evidence and the 2 Prisoners backward and forward there several Times . Sam Davis . I was with the Constable and the Accomplice when the 2 Pistols loaded were found in Smalt 's Box , by the Evidence 's Directions . Q . How comes it that Richard Walker is not here ? Davis . Walker only rents a Room in the House to publish in 2 or 3 Times a Week . The House belongs to Messieurs Hoar and Smith , as Assignees to Thomas Darlow . Prisoner Franklin . At the Time they swear this Robbery was committed , I was confined in New-Prison , Mr. Thomas Smith was then Keeper of the Prison . Here is a Copy of my Committment , dated June 2 . Accomplice . I think it was in June , - the latter End of May , or the beginning of June , that we robb 'd this House . Q . Why you was precise as to the Day , in the beginning of your Evidence . Accomplice . In my Information I set down the latter End of May , or the beginning of June , but when I gave Instructions for drawing the Indictment , I was told I must fix upon a particular Day . Thomas Smith . I was Turn-key of New-Prison , this is a Copy of Franklin 's Commitment , and I know it to be Mr. Gavannah 's ( the Keeper 's ) own Hand Writing . William Belt . I mov 'd Franklin from New-Prison to Newgate last Sessions . Tho.Smith . At that Time I enter 'd every Thing into the Books , but as I was not subpoena 'd , I am not prepar 'd to be exact and particular as to the Time of his Commitment ; the Book and the Original Commitments are at New-Prison . I remember the Time he was committed , and I receiv 'd him my self , I do n't remember how long he was in our Custody , but it was some considerable Time . Mr , Nicholls . His Commitment is enter 'd in our Calender of last Sessions , - 't was the 2d of June last : When they are brought from other Prisons to us , they bring Copies of their Commitments with them , and I enter them in our Calendar . C. To Jenkins . Produce the Plumber 's Bill . Jenkins . Here it is , but 't is almost worn to Pieces in my Pocket . Clerk reads . Here 's no Date - only - 12 Yards of new Pipe , I l. 4 s. 4 ( something ) of Soder , 8 s. Jenkins . I believe the Facts were committed before the Time they say Franklin was committed ; for about the beginning of June , I had the Misfortune to have my Shoulder broke , about the 5th or 6th of June , and I am positive the Facts were committed before that Time , - I believe it might be a Fortnight before , - for when the Pipe was cut , the Water ran into the Cellar , and I stopp 'd it with a Spiggot and Fosset , - a Fortnight I am sure before my Shoulder was broke . Franklin . I came Home about the middle of May , in the Windsor Man of War , and was then paid off , so that I had no need of stealing Leaden Pipe . Smalt . I was a House-keeper in Fleet-Lane , and it is likely I should steal 2 or 3 Yards of Pipe , I was Master of 20 l. Every Morning I rose . Q . To Jenkins . The House was broke at two different Times ; was your Shoulder broke after the last Robbery , or the first ? Jenkins . After the last Robbery was committed . Both Guilty . Death . 20.

Elizabeth Pinada . The Prisoner came into my Shop the 19th of July , to pawn a Shirt . I was above Stairs , but I had left a little Girl in the Shop , and while the Girl was calling me , the Prisoner ( it seems ) run away with these Things ; for when I came down Stairs , the Girl was bellowing at the Door , and told me that that Lady there at the Bar , was gone off with the Bundle .

As I was going down Church-Lane , ( in my way Home ) by Whitechapel Church , as I came between the two Gardens , the Prisoner came up to me , and caught hold of my Collar : Damn your Eyes you Dog , Stand , says he .

Yes you Dog , damn your Eyes , you must stand for me , and so ( says he ) let 's have no more of your Contentions . I told him I was a foolish Traveller , for I never carry 'd Money about me at that Time o'Night He reply 'd , - damn your Eyes , Money you have got , and Money I will have . With that he shook me by the Collar , and my Heel slipping on the little low Bank that runs along the Side of the Garden , I fell down ; but I recover 'd myself and got up again , and threw him over the Bank into the Garden , and my own Hat and Wig went with him . I went over the Bank into the Garden to look for my Hat and Wig , and immediately there came one before me , and another on my Side , and one of them struck me over the Bridge of my Nose , and knock 'd me down , then they dragg 'd me to the Place where I had thrown the Prisoner , and he then came up to me and said - Damn you , you Dog , you struck me : - I 'll send you Home as bare as Adam ; then he sat down upon my Breast , and another of them sat down upon my Legs , and another sat upon my Belly and search 'd me . They took 3 s. and five Farthings out of my right Breeches Pocket , and 3 s. and one Guinea , and a Queen Anne 's half Guinea out of my left Pocket , ( there was a hole thro ' the Head of the half Guinea . ) After they had taken my Money , the Man that sat upon my Legs , look 'd upon my Shoes and cry 'd - Damn my Eyes , he has got a rare pair of Wedgers , - Let 's take them ; so they took them out of my Shoes , and look 'd at them by the light of the Moon , and swore they had made a good Booty . Q . Upon your Oath can you take upon you to say the Prisoner was one of the Men ? Gale . Yes ; I can Swear the Prisoner was one of them ; he was the Man that first stopp 'd me ; he sat upon my Breast and damn 'd his Eyes , and said he would send me Home as bare as Adam . After they had robb 'd me , they were going to strip me , and they tore 4 or 5 Buttons off my Coat , and 2 off my Waistcoat , in stripping me , but some Company happening to come down the Place , the Prisoner got off my Breast and cry 'd , Damn you you Dogs , push away or we are all nail 'd . Prisoner . What Cloaths had I on ? Gale . A green Waistcoat , and a dark brown Wig . Q . How could you distinguish the Colour ( Green ) ? Gale . The Moon shone very bright . C. 'T is difficult to distinguish Green from Blue , by Night . Gale . The Moon shone very bright , - 't was as bright as Day it self . After I was robb 'd I went into the Queen's-Head in Church lane , I was very Bloody , and I described this Man to the People that were there . Q . When did you see the Prisoner again ? Gale . On the Monday : I was robb 'd the Day before , ( Sunday Night ) . This Gentleman took him , and I saw him just after he was taken , and knew him again , among 30 or 40 People . John Billinger . All I have to say is this . When we took the Prisoner , we brought him in a Coach to the Golden-Lyon in Goodman's-Yard in the Minories , and we sent for the Prosecutor . He came , and I believe there were 20 People in the House , the Prosecutor pick 'd him out from all the rest , and said he was the Man . The Prisoner was then dress 'd in a green Waistcoat , and a dark brown Wig . Q . How came you to take the Prisoner ? Billinger . I was at the Queen 's Head in Church-Lane on Monday Morning , and there I heard that the Prosecutor had been robbed , by such a Man . We found the Prisoner in Chick-Lane , running after another Man , whom we took with him . We had got Intelligence in Rosemary-Lane , that such Persons were making Sale of a pair of silver Buckles ; so we went there to look for him , and there we found him . He behaved in a very surly Manner , and said he knew nothing of the Matter . Thomas Gibbons . I was at the taking of the Prisoner in Chick Lane . We were informed he was gone that way to exchange the Buckles with another Person ; so we went into the Minories , but there we could not find him ; then we went into Chick Lane , there we took him and another Man , and brought them to Goodman 's Yard , and sent for the Prosecutor , who pick 'd the Prisoner out among 20 People , and said , that was the Man that first stopp 'd him , and sat upon his Breast while he was robb 'd ; but he would not Swear to the other : Thomas Mills . On Monday Morning about 7 o'Clock , August 1st , I had a little Business in Rag-Fair , and there I met with Mr. Harris , and he told me a Man had been robb 'd by 4 Persons : I went into an Alehouse for a Pint of Beer , and the Prisoner and 3 more came by . He ( the Prisoner ) had then on , a green Waistcoat , and a black Wig : Harris had described the Prisoner to me , and I imagined he answered the Description ; so I went to look for Harris , that we might apprehend him ; but while I was gone to look for Harris , the Prisoner was gone ; we heard , ( upon enquiring after him ) that he was gone to Chick-Lane ; we went there , and took him and another , and brought them to the Golden-Lyon in Goodman 's Yard ; and when the Prosecutor came , he said that was the Man that stopp 'd him first , but the other he would not swear to . Q . Are the Witnesses acquainted with the Prosecutor ? Gale No , I never saw any of them , 'till it was upon this Occasion . Ann Kelly . The Prosecutor ( Gale ) came into Mr. Anderson 's , the Queen 's Head in Church Lane , the Sunday Night that he was robb 'd , all bloody , - 't was the 31st of July , about 10 Minutes after 11 o'Clock : his Cloaths were all daub 'd with Dirt , and his Nose and Mouth bloody . He said , he had been robb 'd of a Guinea and half , and 6 s. in Silver . He said , the Fellow that stopp 'd him had a great Scar here , ( pointing to her Forehead ) that his Nose turned up , and that he had a green Waistcoat , and a white natural sort of a Wig , and one of them he said , had a brown Wig on . Q . Was that the Colour of the Wig ? Kelly . I ca n't say how he described the Man 's Wig , that had the green Waistcoat . Gale . The Prisoner 's Hat had made a red Mark , very red upon his Forehead , and I took it then to be a Scar . John Bareback . The Prosecutor came in that Sunday Night , and said he had been robb 'd of his Money . The Blood run down his Face , and his Cloaths were daub 'd behind . He told us , one of the Men had a Mark in his Face , and that his Nose turn 'd up . He said , they had taken from him a Guinea , a half Guinea , 6 s. in Silver , and a pair of Silver Buckles . Q . Did you take any Notice that some Buttons upon the Prosecutor 's Cloaths were off ? Bareback . No , I did not observe his Buttons . Defence . I never was guilty of such a Misdemeanor in my Life ; they swear against me for the Reward : - they are all Thief-takers . The Prosecutor went to my Father and had a Note of 40 l. from him yesterday , and he said then , he believed I was not the Person . Q . To the Prosecutor . Upon your Oath I ask you , whether you propos 'd to make the Matter up for 40 l. Gale . No , his Friends came to me the Day I went to find the Bill against him ; and they applied to my Sister , to get her to perswade me to make it up ; and a Gentleman came to me himself to perswade me to it , and he told me his Father would not stir for him , nor give a bit of Bread to save his Life . Q . Upon your Oath , - have you took a Note of 40 l. to make up this Matter ? Gale . No , his Friends came to me , and offer 'd me any Thing in the World to do it ; but his Master came and told me , he would give me a Bottle of Wine if I would prosecute him . Prisoner . I desire Mrs. Herrington may be asked , whether he did not hear the Prosecutor say he would not have appeared against me had i not been for Harris the Thief catcher . Herrington . I never saw the Prisoner before in my Life ; I know that Harris came several Times after Gale , and I abus 'd him once , and called him Thief-catcher , and told him he wanted to take away the Fellow 's Life , as he had done by many others , and he abused me , and call 'd me a great many Bitches . I know the Prosecutor was very unwilling to take the Prisoner 's Life . Q . Did you ever hear the Prosecutor say the Prisoner was not the Man that robb 'd him ? Herrington . No . Q . Did you ever hear him say he was the Person ? Herrington . Yes , but he was unwilling to take his Life away . The Prosecutor 's Sister . I saw the Prisoner 's Master ; he said he had been an idle Boy , and that he would not trouble himself about him . Prisoner . Ask her if she did not come to the Grate yesterday Morning , and tell me I might be easy , for her Brother had made this Matter up ? The Sister . The Prisoner 's Friends came to our House last Tuesday , and said , if my Brother wou 'd not prosecute , they would indemnify him as far as 100 l. would go : and yesterday Morning they fetch 'd my Brother to the Prisoner 's Master ; I follow 'd , and when I came there , his ( the Prisoner 's ) Mistress told me , they were gone to the Boy 's Father 's . I went thither , and they gave me a Note for 40 l. to indemnify my Brother , and he took the Note , not to appear against him , to take away his Life ; but he has since been inform 'd , that if he did not prosecute , the Law was open against him , himself . Mr. Gale . I did take the Note , and would not have appeared against the Prisoner , because I did not care to take away his Life ; but Harris subpoena 'd me here , and threat'ned to lay me in a Goal - he told me , if I did not appear , he would prosecute me . This is the Note I took . Clerk reads . Sept. 7 . 1737 . We do jointly and separately promise to pay to Thomas Gale , the Sum of 40 l. of lawful Money of Great-Britain , if ever I John Cotton , or my Parents , in any kind , or I Stephen Young , Father to the said Cotton , do ever misleft ( molest ) the said Gale , then this Note to be in full Force and Vertue . Daniel Grundey . John Cotton . Q . Who is this Grundey ? Gale . He was the Man that was taken up with the Prisoner , - against whom I cou 'd not swear . C. These People ought to be all taken up for endeavouring to stifle the Prosecution . Prisoner . He swore he had no Note , - now he has produced it , - he may as well swear wrong in one Thing as another . Q . To Gale . How could you swear you had no such Note ? Gale . I did not know I had the Note about me , - I did not know whether I had best mention it or not . Q . But you knew you was upon your Oath . The taking such a Note , not to Prosecute , is a Crime in you , and in them that gave it you , for which you may all be Prosecuted . Pray when did you take this Note ? Gale . On Wednesday Morning at this Place . Prisoner . I signed this Note before I was arraign 'd . Mills . I appear 'd here on Wednesday Morning , when the Prisoner was call 'd up , and I informed the Court the Prosecutor was not ready to try him , but I have found since , that he kept out of the way on purpose . Q . To Gale . When did you intimate to the Prisoner that you would try him in earnest ? Gale . Not at all : Harris brought this Subpaena to me , and obliged me to it ; The Prisoner had no Witnesses either to the Fact or his Character , and the Jury found him Guilty . Death . 33.

'T was I that took the Thief , and the Gentleman asked me my Name , and said he would prosecute him , if it cost him five hundred Pounds . I did take hold of the Prisoner indeed , and the Gentleman asked me my Name , and made me come here against the Prisoner . Prisoner . I had been drinking in a Booth , and was in Liquor ; so meeting with a Boy who had won this Cake at the Turnabout Thing , I bought it of him .

Mr. Crook . The Prisoner at the Bar was my Servant , but observing him to be extravagant , I turn 'd him away , after he had been with me 7 Weeks . The Occasion of my charging the Prisoner , was this . A Friend came to me and asked me if I had not lost some Quicksilver ; he imagin 'd I had : Upon this I suspected the Prisoner , and got a Warrant , and charged him with the Fact . He deny 'd it . I told him I had Proof against him , and I desired one in the House to get a Constable , but while the Constable was gone for , the Prisoner ; took to his Heels , and ran away . I follow 'd him , and took him , and put him into the Constable 's Hands . When he was brought back , he desired to speak with me in another Room . So I took the Constable and his Assisstants into another Room with me , and there he told me he had wronged me , and if I would shew him Favour , he would make me Satisfaction . Upon this , I call 'd for Pen , Ink and Paper , and bid him write down what he had wrong 'd me of . Accordingly , before the Constable and the other Person , he wrought down these Particulars . I asked him , when he took them away ? He told me he took them , the Morning he was to go away ; that he sent an empty Box to the Cross-Keys-Inn , and early in the Morning he took these Goods and carry 'd them there in a Bag , then put them into the Box , and sent them to his Lodgings ( that were to be ) by a Porter . The Woman of the House gave me an Account , that she suspected he had robb 'd me , and that the Goods were sent from her House to one Jacob Mello 's . Prisoner . Ask Mr. Crook if he did not ask me to give him a Note of 50 l. Mr. Crook . When I was in the Room with him , he desired me to shew him Favour , and he told me he would give me full Satisfaction , for his Father liv 'd in Reputation , and he should have a good Fortune when he came of Age . I was disposed to favour him at that Time , because I believed all he said , to be true ; and I believe I might say , that if he would make an ingenuous Discovery , I would not Prosecute him . But when I came to enquire into the Truth of what he told me , I found it untrue , and that he had robb 'd me of Goods to the Value of 50 l. This is the Account he wrote himself , in this Paper . Prisoner . Pray how did the Figures come to be alter 'd ? Mr. Crook . Some he alter 'd himself , and some I made myself , because he did not know the Prices of the Goods . The Goods were mine and my Partners ; some of them were taken out of the Shop that is under my House , and some out of that which is under my Partners : Our 2 Houses join together ; he pays Rent for his Part , and I for that which I Occupy . C. I observe here are different Hand-writings on this Paper ; and that which imports the Value , in a different Hand from the rest . Mr. Crook . This Figure and these Words , and Alteration , were done by the Prisoner ; the other were made by me , expressing the Value of the Goods in his Presence . Prisoner . Why did not Mr. Crook shew that Paper , when he was before Sir Richard Brocas ? Mr. Crook . I did not apprehend I had any Occasion to do it , because he was committed only on Suspicion . William Fletcher . I was at Work , and heard the Cry of Stop Thief ; so I ran out , and caught the Prisoner and held him , 'till the Constable came . He desired me to be carry 'd into a Room with Mr. Crook , and accordingly I , and the Constable and Mr. Crook went with him ; and he wrote down the Particulars he had taken from-his Master . There was Quicksilver , and Rhubarb , and other Things , which he confess 'd he had sold to a Jew , who knew they were his Master 's , and he told us the Jew gave him a Note of 12 l. for them . The Constable . Confirmed the above Depositions . Defence . Prisoner . On the 22d of July , Mr. Crook came to my Lodgings and demanded Money for Goods I had sold to a Jew , and he told me he suspected the Goods were his . I told him if he proved that , he should have the Money . Upon that , he brought a Warrant for me in the Name of George Davis . I said that was not my Name , - my Name is John , - So I went away , and he cried after me , - Stop Thief , and I was taken . Then he desired me to write down the Goods I had sold the Jew ; I did so , and they came to 23 l. 6 s. 6 d. Upon this , he said if I would write to my Friends , and get him the Money , he would not Prosecute . He or his Attorney did write to them , and told them , if they would give him 50 l. he would not Prosecute . When he carry 'd me before Sir Richard Brocas , he desired I might be detained 3 or 4 Days , but I was detained 5 Weeks ; and when I petition 'd Sir Richard for him to shew Cause , then he produced that Paper , and said , I own 'd taking those Goods , but 't was no such Thing . Andrew Duke . I am Father-in-Law to the Prisoner . Mr. Crook wrote to me by his Attorney for 50 l. Q . How do you know it was by Mr. Crooks 's Order . Duke . The Attorney wrote to me , and said , he had Orders to write to me for 50 l. - And Mr. Crook himself wrote to me afterwards , - but I have not the Letters here . Robert Parker . I have known the Prisoner ever since he came to Town ; he liv 'd a quarter of a Year with me , and behaved like a sober honest Man . Prisoner . Please to ask Mr. Crook , if he did not order his Attorney to write to my Father for 50 l. and whether he did not come to the Counter , and shew me a Letter he had receiv 'd from my Father ; and whether he did not tell me , he would take my Bond ? Mr. Crook Yes , I did shew him such a Letter . Mr. Parker . I would beg the Favour that the Attorney might be asked , whether he did not write to Mr. Duke , the Prisoner 's Father-in-Law , at Chester , upon this Account . It did not appear that the Attorney was in Court Guilty Felony only . [ Branding . See summary . ] 41. Ann Rice , of St. Margaret 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing a Cambrick Stock , value 6 d. a Silver Stock-buckle , value 2 s. a Silver Knee-buckle , value 3 s. the Goods of Robert Heathfield , August 31st . Robert Heathfield . On the 29th of August in the Morning , the Prisoner came to my House , ( I am a Surgeon ) with a Tumour upon her Hand : I told her I must open it , before it would be well , which I did accordingly . The next Day she came again to have it dress 'd , and then she stole a Stock , and Stock-buckle . I mistrusted her ; so as she was to come again , I pull 'd out one of my Knee-buckles and laid it down in the Window , and when she came the next Day to have her Hand dress d , I went into a Back-room , and left her in the Surgery to put on her Rollers herself . When my Patient was alone , she took the Buckle ; I watch 'd , and saw her , and I suffer 'd her to go out of the House , and follow 'd her half-way up the Street ; then I took her and the Buckle upon her . She was a poor Woman , and I had often done such Jobbs for her out of Charity , and never have had any Thing for my Pains . When she was before the Justice , she said if I would let her go , she would give me an Account of all she had taken from me at other Times , as well as at this ; So she confessed , that about a Twelvemonth ago , she stole a Shirt from me , - I have lost a great many other Things , but did not charge her with them . She confessed that she had , ( at this Time of her coming to my House ) stole a Stock , a Stock-buckle , and a Knee-buckle . Prisoner . I do not know any Thing of it - please to do any Thing with me , but pray do n't Transport me . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 42. Francis Fuller , of St. Margaret 's Westminster , Esq ; was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , but being moved and seduced by the Instigation of the Devil , the 15th , of April , on Adam Cluff , Feloniously , Willfully , and of his Malice aforethought , did make an Assault , and with the But-end of a certain Musquet , val . 5s . which he held in both his Hands , in and upon the left Part of the Breast of the said Cluff , near the left Pap , did strike ; giving him then and there , with the But-end of the said Musquet , on the left part of the Breast near the left Pap , a mortal Bruise ; of which mortal Bruise , he languished , & c. from the said 15th , Day of April , to the 23d , of the same Month , and then Dy 'd . He was a 2d , Time indicted on the Coroners Inquisition for the said Murder . Edward Richards . On Friday Morning the 15th of April , I happen 'd to be in St. James 's Park , and there I saw Colonel Fuller Exercising the Serjeants and Corporals . I stood by to see them Exercise 'till they had done . The Colonel sent all the awkward ones , - those that Exercised awkwardly , to the Hole , to the Drill Serjeants . There was the Deceased and one Inon , and Elisha Turner , and Corporal Maxfield , and Corporal Turner sent down . The Moment they do n't Exercise right , they are sent down to the Drill-Serjeant . After the Exercise was over , and the Men were dismiss 'd , the Colonel went down to the Drill-Serjeant 's , and struck Cluff under the right and left side of his Jaws , and his Throat , with his Fist . Q . Was this in an open Place ? Richards . Yes ; a vast open Place , 't is a plain Place in a Bottom , I could see every Thing that pass 'd . Q . Was you near enough to hear what was said to the Deceased before he struck him ? Richards . He found Fault with him for not Exercising Right , and that put the Colonel in a Passion with him . Q . Was the Deceased the first Man , that the Colonel spoke to at the Drill-Serjeants . Richards . I ca n't say that for all the World . Q . Did you see him speak to , or strike any one beside the Deceased ? Richards . No ; but I heard him find Fault with many of them , as he pass 'd by them . Q . You talk 'd of the Hole , - What Place is that ? Councel . 'T is a little plain Place in the Park . Richards . If they do n't Exercise well , they are sent there , to the Drill Serjeant , for farther Exercise , - to learn farther , and the Colonel follow 'd them thither to see them Exercise himself . He found Fault with many of them , before he came to Cluff , but when he came to him , he call 'd him Chuckle-headed Dog , and struck him with his fist under the right and left side of his Jaws Prisoner . Had he not a Firelock upon his Shoulder ? Richards . Yes ; he had a Firelock upon his Shoulder at the same time Q . How many blows did he gave him Richards . I saw him strike the Deceased three Blows , on the sides of his Neck , and upon his Throat . Q . Were the Blows given with Violence ? Richards . They seem 'd to be pretty hard Q . After the Deceased had been struck did he say any Thing ? Richards . I did not hear him say a Word , not one Word ; but the Colonel catch 'd the Firelock with his Hands , and jobb 'd it against his left Breast , because it did not lye right upon his Shoulder . He took it out of his Hands and jobb 'd the Guard of the Firelock against his Breast Q . How often did he do this ? Richards . Once I do n't say it was the Butend , but the Guard of the Firelock , that is the Part where the Trigger is . He made him rest his Firelock according to this new Method of theirs , - with the left Hand across the Breast . The Colonel did it to make him hold it lower ; he did not rest his Piece as he should have done , so the Colonel took it out of his Hands , shewed him how to rest it with a proper Motion , then he went at him , and jobb 'd this sharp part against his Breast , and threw the Stock across his Shoulder , telling him , if he did not do better in the Afternoon , than he had done in the Morning , he would send him to the Savoy Q . Did he strike him any more than one Blow ? Richards . No , no more ; but then he went away . Q . Was the Deceased the only Man that the Prisoner struck ? Richards . He struck none of them but him . Q . What Day of the Week was this ? Richards . This was on the Friday ; and on the Wednesday Evening following , about 7 o'Clock , I went to Chapel Street , Westminster , and being sadly grip 'd , I call 'd in at a Shop that had been a Gin shop , for half a Quartern of Cordial Water , and while I was in the Shop , Adam Cluff ( the Deceased ) came by the Door , stooping , bending , and coughing ; so I said , Adam , - I heard you were bad and kept your Bed ; I shook Hands with him , and told him , I was heartily glad to see him . Oh ! says he , ( with his Hand across his Breast ) I am a dead Man ; for the Blows that Colonel Fuller gave me , has occasioned my Death . I am a dead Man , and shall not recover it . I bid him not be afraid , but have a good Heart , and go Home and take Care of himself . Oh ! says he , I will go home as fast as I can , - m , Officer is not in Town , but he has sent me Word he will see me righted . Councel . You say you was at a Distance when you saw all this ; how many Yards might you be off ? Richards To look down Hill , - it was not much farther than the Length of this Court . There was no Body between us , but the Ranks of Corporals and Serjeants - I believe I might be 10 Yards distant . - I believe it might be 20 or better .. Councel . Have not you declared it was 50 Yard ? Richards . It could not be 50 Yards . I said it was about 20 or 30 Yards , - I never said it was 50 in my Life . The Surgeons were ordered to be called next .

Mr. Westbrook open 'd the Body , and the rest of the Surgeons were by , viz . Mr. Edmunds , Mr. Tagg , Mr. Lewis , Mr. Davis , Mr. Harris , Mr. Young , and Mr. Ormered . Mr. Westbrook . I was apply 'd to by the Church-Wardens of the Parish , ( on Account of this Letter in the Coroner 's Hands ) to attend the Inquest . I had notice that the Body was prepared , and was ready for us . When I came to the Church-yard , I had some Conference with the rest of my Brethren ; most of them were of Opinion , that we ought to let the Body alone ; that it was not safe for us to meddle with it , on Account of our Healths . The Body had been Buried so long , that we thought we could make no Discovery , and that we should endanger our selves besides . But however , I ventur 'd and open 'd the Body with the greatest Circumspection . The out-side was very putrid . By the Hint I had from the Letter , I judged the Damage was agreed to be in the Breast only , so I open 'd it ; but I found nothing that seemed to be the effect of Violence , which could be the Occasion of his Death . 'Twill not be amiss to acquaint the Court , what we thought would be the appearance , if the Deceased had received a Punch that had occasion 'd his Death , viz . Fractur 'd Ribs , or extravasated Blood in the inside of the Body ; but there was neither . These things would have appeared , if the Man had Died of such a Hurt , and we know of no other Appearance , which we might expect to have seen . This will be an Answer to the Question , - Whether we could be Judges of the Deceased 's Case , when he had been Buried 12 Days . After I had taken the Flesh clean off the Ribs , I split them down with my Knife , and made my Man break them off , and every one of them snapp 'd loud and strong ; which they would not have done ; if they had been Fractur 'd . The Chest was free from extravasated Blood , but upon farther enquiry , I found an appearance of Matter upon the Membrane of the Breast . This Membrane we call the Mediastinum ; it divides the Breast into two Parts ; it opens in the Center and receives the Heart in the Middle . On the left side , there was an Appearance of Matter , - perhaps half an Ounce or something more . Some of my Brethren turn 'd their Heads away on Account of the Stench , and did not observe this ; but I call 'd to them , that they might judge of it . They disputed a little while , whether it was Matter or not ; they thought it might be some little quantity of Fat , but I shew 'd them plainly that 't was impossible it should be Fat , and that it was Matter . From the Circumstances of the Case it is plain , that this Matter was the Consequence of an Inflamation on the Mediastinum , near the middle of the Cavity of the Breast , but it was on the left Side of the Breast , and I apprehend , by it 's being far remov 'd from the Ribs and the Breast-Bone , that it was not occasioned by an outward Blow ; for it had been occasion 'd by the bending-in of the Ribs , it would have been nearer the Place where the Blow was given . For this Reason I imagine it was the Effect of some natural Cause ; and that the Matter proceeded from an inward Inflamation , and there suppurated . The outward Parts of the Body were so bad , we could perceive no Appearance of any outward Bruise , the inward Parts we could perceive plainly . Q . Suppose a Blow given on the middle of the Thorax , might not such a Blow occasion the Matter : Mr. Westbrook . I think that 's not the Case . On the bending-in off the Ribs , by an outward Blow , the Lining of the Breast may be strain 'd , and an Inflamation may happen on that Part where the Blow was given . This Membrane divides the Breast a cross , 't is in the middle of the Hollow of the Breast , and not contiguous to the outward Part . I verily believe that this Matter did not proceed from any outward Blow , it was the Effect of an Inflamation , and not of any Blood spilt . 'T is possible indeed that Blood in a Fortnight 's Time may occasion Matter ; but that is not the Case , because the Lining of the Breast kept the Matter in a suspended Way , it did not fall down into the Bottom of the Cavity , and as far as the Matter had fallen upon the Membrane it had corrupted and eaten it , - exactly as far as the Matter had spread . I think the Inflamation proceeded to a Degree of Corruption , and this Conjecture tallies pretty well with the Complaints which I heard the Deceased had made before . Therefore I gave my Opinion on the Coroner 's Inquisition that I believed he died a natural Death . Counc . Were the Searchers present at the Coroner 's Inquisition , - who searched the Body before he was buried ? Mr. Westbrook . I ca n't tell , - we pay but little Regard to what they bring in . Mr. Davis , Surgeon . I was present when the Body was opened , and my Opinion is , that he died a natural Death . I attended him in his illness ; the first Time I was with him , was the 21st of April . Q . Have you ever attended him before ? Mr. Davis . Yes . Q . How long before this Accident ? Mr. Davis . I ca n't justly tell ; but he was lame when he was last under my Hands ; I believe it was about 2 Months before . On Thursday Morning the 21st of April , I attended him first , his Complaint was , that he had taken Cold , had a Cough and stitches in his Side . I advised him to be blooded in the Arm : then I ordered him an oily Medicine for his Cough , and told him , if his Stiches continued , he must be let Blood again . These were the only Complaints he made to me . When I attended him this Time , his Cloaths were open , and I saw his Breast bare , but I perceived no Signs of Violence at all . I was going up Stairs to him , but he met me upon the Stairs , and said he would not trouble me to come up , he would come down to me . I saw nothing upon his Breast , nor did he complain of his having received any Blow . Counc . This was the very Day after he met the first Witness at the Brandy Shop . Q . Did you look at his Breast ? Mr. Davis . I did not put away his Shirt to look at it ; but it being open , I saw his Breast . This was on the Thursday , and on the Saturday he died . On the Friday I saw the Corporal of the Company , and he told me , that the Deceased was then taking the Medicines I had order 'd . Q . Did this Corporal tell you of any other Complaints that he made ? Mr. Davis . No , he only said - he was taking his Medicines . I have been Surgeon in that Regiment about 7 Years . Q . Did you see the Deceased any more before his Death ? Mr. Davis . No . I never had any Patient under Cure that ever complain 'd he had received any Hurt from Colonel Fuller . I have 7 Companies under my Care ; and I have the Infirmary Regiment likewise , and I never heard any of the Men ever complain of any Violence that the Colonel had been guilty of toward them . Q . What are your Sentiments concerning the Death of this Man ? Mr. Davis . 'T is my Opinion he died of a Paralytic Fever : the Symptoms of which I have mention 'd before , viz the Cough , and the Stitches in his Side . We could discover no Marks of Violence . Q . You have heard Mr. Westbrook 's Reasons why the Deceased did not come by his Death by any outward Violence . Are they good Reasons ? Mr. Davis . Yes , I agree with him entirely . Mr. John Ormerod , Surgeon . I was present at the opening the Body of the Deceased , and I believe he dy 'd a natural Death . My Reasons are those two which Mr. Westbrook has already given , that either there would have appear 'd extravasated Blood , or fractur 'd Ribs , and I believe those Signs are inseparable from Accidents of this kind . I have open 'd Bodies where there has been no external Wound , and yet I have always found these Signs . I believe he died a natural Death . Mr. Edward Edmonds , Surgeon . I was at Mr. Westbrook 's right Hand when the Body was open 'd ; I agree with him , and believe he died a natural Death , and for the same Reasons that Mr. Westbrook has given . In making my Observation , I saw a small Inflamation ) on the left Lobe of the Lungs , beside one on the Pleura , which I think , ( with the other Inflamation ) occasion 'd his Death . The Collection of Matter , ( to be sure ) was from an Inflamation ; but if that had been caused by any outward Blow , there must have been the Symptoms that have been before mentioned . Mr. Archibald Harris . I likewise was present when the Body was open 'd . My Opinion is , that he died a natural Death , and that it did not proceed from any external Violence whatever ; no Signs having appear 'd to us upon the opening of the Body . Mr. Westbrook 's Reasons weigh with me , and I 'm of the same Opinion . Q . Have you any additional Reasons ? Mr. Harris . I can only say , that he complain 'd of a Pain in his Side , for which a Barber let him Blood ; I ask 'd the Barber what sort of Blood it was , and he ( the Barber ) told me , 't was very fizy . G. That 's not proper Evidence . Mr. Richard Tagg . I was present , and agree on the 'forementioned Symptoms , that there had been no Violence , but that the Man died a natural Death . Mr. William Young , Surgeon . I have the Misfortune to be deaf , I hope the Court will indulge me - When the Body was inspected I was present : According to the best Observation I could make , there were no Signs of any outward Injury ; to all Appearance he died a natural Death , there were no visible Marks of Violence . Mr. Shipton was call 'd and sworn . Q . To Mr. Shipton . You have heard the Reasons given by the Surgeons that induce them to believe the Deceased died a natural Death ; do you imagine their Reasons are good ? Mr. Shipton . Yes ; for this Reason . In Fevers , and lingering Illnesses , the Blood will be corrupted but where Death is occasioned by external Violence , that Violence will be perceptible a Fortnight after . In such a Case as this , there would have appear 'd an extravasation of Blood , or a Fracture of the Sternum , or Ribs . Q . To the Coroner . Can any other of your Witnesses give any farther Account of the Violence offer 'd the Deceased , than what the first Witness has done ? Coroner . No ; none of them can say so much . There are none else , but People who speak to his Complaints , and one Man , who can say some little Matter beside . Prisoner . I desire the Drill Serjeant may be called . Joseph Gage . Drill-Serjeant . Colonel Fuller came down to see the Serjeants and Corporal 's exercise , who were under my Care , and he walked along a single Rank , and found Fault with some People , before he came to the Deceased . When he came to him , he found Fault with him likewise , - that he kept his Elbow too high ; and the Deceased not taking it lower , he struck him on the Elbow two or three Times . C. But here 's a Man saw him strike the Deceased on the Jaws . Gage . I saw nothing more than I have related . I attended on the Colonel , and saw no more , and this was at the resting of the Firelock . Q . Did not the Prisoner take the Deceased 's Firelock out of his Hand ? Gage . No ; I did not see him take the Firelock out of his Hand at all . I must have seen it , if he had done so , - for I was very near them . Q . Did not you see him give the Deceased a Blow with the But-end , upon his Breast ? Gage . No . Q . How near were you to them ? Gage . I was attending the Front ; within 3 or 4 Yards of them . Serjeant Caldecat . On the 18th of April - the 17th I believe it was , - the Deceased went to Epping , and the 18th I saw him in the Morning ' ; he was coming down Stairs . Country-man , says I , how d'you do ? Very bad says he , - come in and sit down . I am very ill , says he , for I was base fuddled last Night , and I have a Pain in my Breast and all over my Body . I got so much Liquor last Night , ( says he ) that I had a great many Falls , and I believe , I have broke something within me . The Deceased had been at the Green Man , summoning Men , against the next Field-Day . He told me he had had so many Falls , that he believed he had bruised or broke something within him , and he was not able to stand to exercise the next Day . Q . When did he exercise ? Gage . He exercised that Day ( the 16th of April , ) almost an Hour after the Blows . And next Day he Exercised as usual , without any Complaint . On Monday he came about half an Hour too late , and I asked him the Reason of his being too late , and he told me he had hurt his Foot , or his Leg , I ca n't tell which . William Jones . I was by when the Deceased was Exercising before the Drill Serjeant , and I observed the Colonel to strike him with his Hand . Q . Did you observe the Colonel strike him with the end of the Piece ? Jones . I ca n't say I saw any such Thing , and I was nearer than the first Witness . Q. Whereabout did he strike him ? Jones . Somewhere about the Head or Face , but I did not see him strike him with the Piece . Q . Did you see him , when he performed that Part of his Exercise , which they call , - resting the Musket ? Jones . Yes . Q . Did the Colonel take the Musket out of his Hand ? Jones . To the best of my Remembrance , he took it out of his Hand , and put it upon his ( the Deceased 's ) Shoulder , telling him at the same Time , that he did not do the Motion , that he had shewn him before . Q . Did not he then give him a Blow upon the Breast with the But-end of it ? Jones . I did not see any Thing of it , and I was between Richards ( the first Witness ) and the Serjeant who was exercising the Men . General Wills . Mr. Fuller is my first Major ; and ever since I have had the Regiment he always appear 'd a good-natur 'd Man , and has often beg 'd off Men from Punishment . I never knew him guilty of an ill-natur 'd Action in my Life ; on the contrary , I have pardon 'd Men at his Request . I do n't remember that I had ever any Man complain 'd of him , but once , and that was about five Years ago . A Man complain 'd he had struck him with his Cane , and upon my speaking to Mr. Fuller about it , he told me he never more would carry a Cane , or ever strike any of them again . Lord Nassau Paulet . I have known Colonel Fuller several Years . I never saw an ill-natur 'd Action committed by him in my Life . He is a Man that always behaves with Decency , and I take him to be as good-natur 'd a Man , as any I. know . Major General Barryl . I have known him five and twenty Years . I never saw him ill natur 'd or troublesome ; and I have been often drinking with him in Company , at Times when Men most expose their Passions . I never knew him guilty of an ill-natur 'd Action in my Life . The Jury without withdrawing , acquitted the Prisoner , and found that Adam Cluff died a natural Death . 43. William Clark , of St. Martins in the Fields , was indicted for assaulting Eman Wilque , in a certain Court and open Place near the King's-Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Silver Watch , and Steel Chain , value 5l . and a Steel Seal , set in Bath Metal , value 6 d. July 27 . The Prosecutor being a French-man , an Interpreter was sworn . Eman Wilque . I was robb 'd of my Watch , by the Prisoner , the 27th of July , three Quarters of an Hour after Three in the Morning , on the other Side of Covent Garden . Being lock 'd out of my House , I asked for a Place to pass the Night in , and I was directed to Covent-Garden , - to a Place where the People are up all Night . When I got there , a Woman came and sat down by me . Q . What Place was this ? Wilque . A Night Cellar . - When the Woman sat down by me , I withdrew from her to another Table , and call 'd for Beer . While I was here , the Prisoner and another Man came in , - the other Man speak French , and they both sat down with me . I had paid the Master of the Cellar 3d , or 4d , before they came in , and my Reckoning when I was coming away was 9d . I had no Money , so I offer 'd my Watch in Pawn for the 9d , to the Master of the Cellar . The Man that was with the Prisoner , pretended to be my Friend , and said it was needless to leave the Watch , for as he was going my way , he would give the 9d , and would go Home with me and receive it again . Upon this I came away with the Prisoner and the other Man , between 3 and 4 in the Morning , and as we were going along , the Prisoner frequently asked - What 's a Clock ? I hesitated to pull out my Watch , but at last I did , and this Prisoner snatched it from me , and the other Man knock 'd me down , while the Prisoner ran away with the Watch . Q . How came you to go away between 3 and 4 o'Clock , when you went there to stay all Night ? Wilque . It had been full Day-light half an Hour , before I left the Cellar . The Prisoner took my Watch , and the other Man that talked French , struck me on the Breast with his Head and tumbled me down . Upon that I call 'd two Men , and said I was robb 'd of my Watch , and they went in Pursuit of them . I call 'd out - Thief - Thief , and some People look 'd out and saw the Prisoner , and the other Man . I was told at Home the same Day that the Prisoner was taken , and the Watch was found in his Pocket , so I was asked to go before the Justice . Q . Did they take nothing but your Wathc from you ? Wilque . Yes ; when I tumbled down my Hat fell oft my Head , and they ran away with that too , but that is not in the Indictment . When I came to the Justice 's , I saw my Watch , the Name upon it is , Faul'ie . Q . Which of the Men paid the Reckoning ? Wilque . The other Man , - not the Prisoner . Edmund Norton . I apprehended the Prisoner at the corner of Phoenix Court , in Long-Acre about 12 o'Clock at Noon . I pursu 'd him from 4 in the Morning to that Time . I am Beadle , and the Fact was committed in my Walk , and very near my Door . Upon hearing the Noise , at first I thought there had been a Fire , and therefore I jumped out of Bed in my Shirt , and saw the Prisoner running away , and the other Man knock 'd the Prosecutor down several Times , to prevent his going after him . I am positive the Prisoner is the Man who was in Company with him that knock 'd the Prosecutor down . I took the Prisoner about Noon Fighting with one William Dorrel , and when I had him before the Justice we search 'd him , and found the Watch upon him . Mr. Justice Frazier has it in his Pocket . ( The Watch was produced ) I 'll Swear this is the Watch that I found upon the Prisoner in his right coat Pocket . Prisoner . At the Time this Fray happen 'd there were a thousand People going by . Norton . There were several People going by : but the Frenchman , not expressing himself right , they imagin 'd it was only a Battle , and cry 'd , Well done little one , for the Prisoner 's Companion was less than the Prosecutor , yet he knock 'd him about and beat his Head against the Windows - the poor Frenchman ( the Prosecutor ) was beat in a terrible Manner ; I saw how the matter was , and had I not blunder 'd about a good while to find my Shoes , I had taken them before they had made their Escape . I apprehend that Dorrel who was Fighting with the Prisoner when I took him , had quarrel 'd with him , in order to get a share of the Booty . Rachael Stevens . I live in Red-Lion-Court near Long-Acre , one End goes into Drury-Lane , the other into Long-Acre . I happen 'd to be up the 27th of July all Night , with a Child that was dying , and looking out of the Window between 3 and 4 in the Morning , I saw 3 Men come up the Court , and they stopp 'd against my House : one of the Men asked the French-man what o'Clock it was ? He pull 'd out his Watch , and said 't was almost 4 ; let me see , says one of them , - but I ca n't swear which of them it was that said so . Me tell you ( says the Frenchman ) dat it be almose Vore , why ca n't you let me see , says the other ) Me tell you dat it be almose vore , by mine Vash , says the Frenchman , and was going to put it up in his Pocket ; but one of them snatch 'd it out of his Hand , and said , - now you know , - me pay de Reckoning vor you , - me pay tres Sheling , and dat Man pay two Sheling , - ven you pay me de Crown , you sall have a de Vash again . Upon this , says the Frenchman , - den you come along vid me , me pawn my Vash , and me pay you , - and so they all went civilly down the Court ; but as soon as they had turned the Corner , I heard a great Outcry , and presently the Man that had snatch 'd the Watch , came running up the Court again , and the Frenchman after him , crying Teef - Teef - got mine Vash , - got mine Vash ; and as he was turning the Corner to go into Long-Acre , the other came up and knocked the Frenchman down ; in his Fall , his Hat flew off , and a Woman took it up and ran away with it . I ca n't be positive to the Men , but I saw the Watch in the Man 's Hand that ran away , and saw the other knock the Frenchman down . Q . To Wilque . Did the Prisoner and the other pay 5 s. for you ? Wilque . Not a Farthing more than 9 d. and that the other Man paid , - not the Prisoner . James Powel . Mr. Norton call 'd me to assist him ; I am a Porter in Long-Acre , at the Corner of Phoenix-Court . 'T was about 12 o'Clock at Noon , he charged me to hold the Prisoner fast ; I did so , and we carry 'd him before the Justice ; there Mr. Norton searched him , and took the Watch out of his right Coat Pocket . The Prisoner had little or nothing to say for himself , - and that 's all I know . William Dorrel . I will tell you what I know of the Matter . I was walking down Drury-Lane the 27th of July , and there I heard a great Noise about the Prisoner 's having robb 'd a Gentleman of his Watch ; so I went a little farther , and I saw the Prisoner and one John Cane scuffling together ; Cane call 'd to me , and bid me lay hold of him , for he had that very Morning robb 'd a Gentleman of his Watch and his Hat . I laid hold of him , and carry 'd him to the White Hart in Hart street , and sent Cane to look for the Constable and the Owner of the Watch . When Cane was gone , the Prisoner started up , and said he would not stay with me , so away he ran , and I after him When I overtook him , he struck me with this Stick , but a Coachman lending me another , the Prisoner surrender 'd , and told me , if I would let him go along quietly , he would turn Evidence , and would hang 3 or 4 before he would be hang 'd himself . We carry 'd him before Justice Frazier , and upon searching him , the Watch was found in his Pocket . John Cane . On the 27th of July , my Wife and I were coming up Drury Lane , between 3 and 4 in the Morning , and we saw the Prisoner , and his Sister , and his Brother-in-Law , and another Man at the Corner of Red-Lion-Court ; they were using the Frenchman in a very barbarous Manner , they beat him terribly , - and his Hair was all over his Eyes . Q . Who was using the Man ill ? Cane . Clark 's ( the Prisoner 's ) Sister , and her Husband , and the Prisoner struck him ( the Prosecutor ) upon the Belly , because he made a Noise , and held the Prisoner by the Coat , crying out at the same Time , - O my Vash ! my Vash ! I went up to them , and asked them if they were not ashamed to use the Man in that manner ? The Prisoner 's Brother-in-law was speaking French to the Prosecutor , and while he was speaking to him , the Prisoner ran away with the Watch , and his Sister with the Hat ; the Prosecutor would have run after him , but the Brother-in-Law knock 'd him down and beat him , while the Prisoner got away . Q . To Wilque . Did any Body abuse you beside the Prisoner , and the other Man that talk 'd French ? Wilque . No , no Body else . Q . What Time might there be between their first demanding what it was o'Clock , and the Prisoner 's running away with the Watch ? Wilque . About two Minutes . Cane . About 8 or 9 in the Morning , I heard that one Kelly , ( who lodges in one Leadbeater 's House with the Prisoner ) was taken , and that he had declared , the Prisoner had got the Watch ; so I went down to Leadbeater 's , and there I saw the Prisoner , and Money and a Watch lying before him upon a Table ; there was one Cassedy with him , and I suppose Cassedy was buying the Watch of the Prisoner , for when I asked them what they were doing , and told them , that Watch was the Frenchman 's , Cassedy took up the Money again , and said he would have nothing to do with it , and the Prisoner put the Watch into his Pocket . Then I laid hold of him , and said he should not go , 'till the Prosecutor came ; he got up , but I kept him safe , and brought him down to Drury-Lane ; and as we were going by Little Russel-Street , I call 'd Dorrel , the Soldier to assist me , so we carry 'd him to the White Hart , in Hart Street , by Covent Garden , and there I left him while I went to get a Constable , but while I was gone , he made his Escape . Eliz Cane . My Husband and I were coming from Covent-Garden , about Three or Four in the Morning , and there I saw the Prisoner , and the Prosecutor , and another Man , at the End of Red-Lyon-Court . The Prisoner struck the Prosecutor several Blows upon the Stomach , upon which my Husband went up , and said , if you have robb 'd the Gentleman , do n't kill him . The Frenchman cry 'd out - rob ! rob ! - Vash ! Vash ! My Spouse got between them and parted them , and then the Prisoner ran away . About an Hour after , I saw the Prisoner again , and he pull 'd out a Watch at the End of Queen-Street , to shew it to his Sister . Prisoner . Cane and his Wife were drinking with me , at the same Time ; and he stripp 'd himself and wanted to fight me . Cane . When I saw the Prisoner and the other Man about the Frenchman , in the Morning , I took them to be Sodomites , because the Prisoner had his Hand upon the Frenchman 's Breeches . Prisoner . I will bring sufficient Witnesses , to prove the Watch was pawn 'd with me . Q . To Norton . What Character has the Prisoner ? Norton . A very bad one ; he is upon Record for a Rape , and for willfull and corrupt Perjury . The Cellar where this Robbery was concerted , is a Place that I have mention 'd several Times to the Justices , and have desired them to grant no Licence . We are afraid to enter at any Time upon any Occasion , for if we do , the Candles are all put out , and the Constables are severely beaten . The Cellar Man . I keep the Cellar , - my Name is Abram Fowler . C. Then the Justices shall know your Name , Sir . Fowler . There are more Night Houses than mine , - why are they not all suppress 'd ? - About the 27th of July , - there , or thereabout , the Frenchman came down into my Cellar , about 11 or 12 o'Clock . He was there some Time , and paid for two or three Pints of Beer , - for , my Lord , 't is the Custom of us who keep such Cellars , to make the People pay for the Liquor as it comes in , for fear they should run away and Bilk us . But to go on , - when the Frenchman 's Money was out , - he could not sit for nothing , - so he call 'd for more Beer , and gave me his Watch to keep 'till Morning . Well , - he drank 5 or 6 Pints of Beer , and I had his Watch in my Custody , that I might be sure of my Reckoning . While he was drinking , in comes the Prisoner , and another Man with him that could talk French . They sat down with the Prosecutor and in a little Time seem 'd very familiar together . After they had been together some Time , the Man that spake French , asked me if I had got the Gentleman 's Watch in Custody ? Yes , says I , 't was given me to keep 'till he pays me his Reckoning . How much does he owe you upon it , says he ? I told him twas pawn 'd for 9 d. Bring the Watch , says he , I 'll pay you the Money . I brought the Watch and gave it into the Prosecutor 's Hands , and the Prisoner 's Friend pay 'd me the 9 Pence . After this , a Pot of Beer came in , and the Prisoner and his Friend pay 'd for the Frenchman . Nay , they drank 2 or 3 Hours after the 9 Pence was paid . I 'll tell you how it was , - the Man that spoke French , paid 1 s. for the Prosecutor 's 9 Pence , so then there was a Pot to come in , and after that they drank 2 or 3 Hours , and the Prisoner and his Companion paid all the Reckoning . 'T is true it did not come to much , because they drank nothing - but - Beer - common Beer . - The 9 Pence Reckoning was contracted before these People came . Q . And did the Prosecutor stay 2 or 3 Hours in your Cellar after these Men came in ? Pray what Time did he go out . Fowler . About Four o'Clock . C. He came in about 11 or 12 , and paid for 2 or 3 Pints of Beer , you say before they came in , and after they came in , you say they drank together 2 or 3 Hours . Fowler . My Lord , he gave his Liquor about to the People that were there , he did not drink all that he call 'd for himself . - They went away together about Four o'Clock in the Morning , and the next News I heard was - that the Prisoner was taken up and carry 'd before Justice Frazier , for stealing the Watch ! I went directly thither , and there I saw the Prosecutor , and his Worship asked him if he had lost his Watch ? I have given it , says he , to a Man that paid my Reckoning for me last Night . Was you robb 'd ? - No , - I have given it to a Man that pay 'd 9 Pence for me . Then the Justice offer 'd him his Oath : But the Prosecutor said he was a Roman . No matter for that , - swear the Truth , says the Justice . When he was sworn , the Interpreter asked him upon Oath , if he had been robb 'd ? He said No , a Man had his watch who had paid 9 Pence for him , and that he expected to have it again . Why , says the Justice , the Man that has the Watch , says he paid 6 s. 10 d. upon it . No , no , says the Frenchman , it be no Ingliseman take mine Vash , - it be won Frenchman dat ware his own Hair ; he pay de 9 Pence vor me . Then the Justice asked the Persons that brought the Prisoner before him , why they took him up ? I did make mush Noise ( said the Frenchman ) but vether I vas rob , I not know ; I vant to keep de Man , dat I may get my Vash . The Justice upon this , would have discharged the Prisoner , but one of the Men that took the Prisoner informed him that not with standing what the Prosecutor then said , he did believe he was robb 'd in earnest . Mr. Justice Frazier . Mr. Norton brought the Prisoner before me , and charged the Prisoner on his own Oath , as he had seen the Robbery himself . I sent for the Prosecutor , but he did not appear in 2 Hours . The first Thing I did was to search the Prisoner ; the Watch being found upon him , I order 'd him to give an Account of himself , and how he came by it . He told me he lodged in Surrey with a Washerwoman , and that he was at Home that Night about Nine or Ten o'Clock , in Surrey ; then he said he had forgot himself , and own 'd he was out till Four in the Morning . I found we could not get the Prosecutor , so I committed him for further Examination . But a little while after I had committed the Prisoner , that Man - who keeps the Night Cellar , brought the Prosecutor to me , and he and his Companions pull 'd him about and put Words into his Mouth . I should have told your Lordship , that when the Prisoner was before me , he told me , he had lent 6 s. upon the Watch . When the Prosecutor was examined , he did say he was not robb 'd but that the Watch was pawn 'd for 9 d. I resolved to enquire farther into the Matter , and as I was then going to St. Martin 's Vestry , - I order 'd them all to attend me again at 6 o'Clock , for I imagin 'd the Prisoner to be a bad Man , and that they had endeavour 'd to stifle the Evidence . When I examin 'd them again at 6 , the Frenchman told me he had been robb 'd indeed , and was now willing to give Evidence ; that the Men who were before me in the Morning , had disswaded him from prosecuting the Prisoner , telling him it would be chargeable , troublesome , & c. when I shewed the Prosecutor the Watch , he swore to it , and that the Prisoner was the Man that had robb 'd him . Q . To Wilque . Pray how came you when you was first before Mr. Justice Frazier , to declare that you was not robb 'd ? Wilque . There were 5 or 6 People upon me , terrifying and teizing me , - they told me the Man was not taken , and bid me not insist upon his being committed if he should be taken , for if he was committed he would be hang 'd . One of these Men is here in Court , that is one of them , ( pointing to Cassedy . ) Q . Who are you , Sir ? Cassedy . I live in Cross Lane in Holborn , - no , I am not a House-keeper , but I pay about 6 or 7 l. a Year for 2 Rooms , and I am a Stay-maker by Trade . Q . Who knows you ? Is there any Body here can give any Account of you ? Cassedy . Yes , here 's a Gentleman knows me , Mr. Fowler knows me . C. O ! that 's the Man that keeps the Night-Cellar ; I suppose the Prisoner knows you likewise . Norton . There has been 15 or 16 of this Gang that have threatned my Life , if I appeared in this Matter . Wilque That Man ( Cassedy ) told me I should have my Watch again if I would not prosecute , and as a Token thereof , he said I should have his ( Cassedy 's ) 'till my own was return 'd Q . To Mr. Frazier ) Was the Prosecutor upon Oath , when he said he was not robb 'd ? Justice Frazier ) Yes , my Neice understanding French , she interpreted upon Oath . Mr. Frazier 's Niece ) Two Hours after the Prisoner was committed the Prosecutor came ; I ask 'd him if he had been robb 'd of his Watch ? He said no , the Man had lent him 9 d. upon it , And had not robb 'd him . This he said several Times over . Mr. Frazier . But when he came again about 6 o'Clock , he swore that he was absolutely robb 'd , and his Information was read over to him 3 Times , I ask 'd him the Reason of his denying it before ? He told me , he was afraid of these People , that they had frighted him , and that he did not understand our Laws ; but since that , his Landlady had told him , he must speak , and tell the whole Truth . Cassedy . I was drinking at the Horse Shoe and Magpye in Clare Market , and the Prisoner came in the Morning that this Accident happen 'd , about 6 o'Clock . Some Time after , Cane came in and laid hold of the Prisoner , telling him the Frenchman made a great Noise about the Watch , and that if it was not return 'd , he ( Cane ) should be brought into Trouble . Why , says the Prisoner , I lent 6 s. and some odd Pence upon it , if you 'll give me the Money , I will give it you . Cane would not take it , then the Prisoner offer 'd it to me ; but I would not take it . Then they went to the Bull head in Vere street , and at that Time the Man of the Night Cellar and I came in together . Cane 's Wife told them in my hearing that the Frenchman was hard by , and if he might have his Watch again he would be satisfied . After this , I met the Frenchman in Wild-street , and I asked him if he had been robb 'd ? No , no , says he , and at the same Time I know the Prisoner had the Watch in his Pocket , and the Chain hanging out ; so I took him ( the Prosecutor ) to the Bull head , but when we came there , they had carry 'd the Prisoner to Justice Frazier 's . Upon this , I carry 'd the Frenchman to the Justice 's House , and there he said he had pawn 'd his Watch to a Man that speak mush French , and that he no was rob . The Justice asked him , how he came to make such a Noise about it if he was not robb 'd ? No , I vas var drunk ( says he ) so me lay mine on the Table sometime , so de Men go out , I fear Men not give mine Vash again , so I go after and cry robbe ! robbe ! mine Vash ! mine Vash ! C. Why , it seems you are the Person that perswaded him to say all this ! Wilque . He ( Cassedy ) pull 'd out a Watch in an Ale-house , and offer 'd it me if I would be quiet : that 's the very Man . Francis Lambert I keep a Publick-House in Parker 's Lane : on Wednesday Night Cane came into my House , and the Prisoner being there , some Words arose between them , upon which Cane said , - by G - d I will swear your Life away . Cane . My Lord , that Man 's an Irishman Alexander Bark . Why , Cane 's an Irishman himself . He came into Lambert 's House and said , - right or wrong , he 'd hang the Prisoner , and his Wife said , whoever came to swear for the Prisoner would be committed . Cane . This is an Irishman too my Lord . Bark . My Lord , - I drove the Lord Chief Baron Gilbert in Ireland , - I was his Coachman when Cane was transported from thence . The Night Cellar-Man . My Lord , I have known the Prisoner this 5 or 6 Years , - I never - Q . To Norton . Pray what Character has this Man 's Cellar ? Norton . A very bad one , my Lord . The Reason we ca n't prevent such Things as these is , we dare not go down into his Cellar for Fear of being knocked on the Head ; when the Constable and Beadles go down , the Candles are all put out , and they are beaten almost to Death . Cellar Man I was arrested and put in Newgate for Debt ; Mr. Nichols can give an Account of me . Mr. Nicholls . I know nothing at all of him . A Woman . I have known the Prisoner 5 or 6 Years , I am a Milliner in Piccadilly . He liv 'd 4 Years ago ( as a Servant ) at my Lord Strafford 's ; since that he was Servant to a Relation of mine , one Morris a Doctor of Physick in Soho Square . Prisoner . The last Place I liv 'd at was Hill 's Coffee-House , and since that I have been lame . Q . How came you then to frequent Night Cellars at 3 or 4 o'Clock in the Morning ? Prisoner . I got up early that Morning , because I was to go with my Sister to Hampstead , who lives there with some credible People . A Witness . That was the Woman that run away with the Man 's Hat . Prisoner . I had lent 6s . 10d . to the Frenchman upon the Watch , and as we were going along , he collar 'd me , and would have it again without paying me the Money . Wilque . He paid not one Farthing more than 9 d for me . A Witness . I was in Lambert 's House , and heard that Woman ( Cane 's Wife ) say , that no Body would have the Assurance to appear in the Prisoner 's Behalf , for if they did , they would be secur 'd in Court . C. When manifest Perjuries are discover 'd , the Persons offending ought to be committed and punish 'd . Prisoner . Mr. Lambert can speak to my Character . Lambert . My Wife can speak better to it than I can , - she 's an Irishwoman . Mrs. Lambert . I have known the Prisoner 4 Years and a half ; for this last Year or two , I never knew nothing of him but what was true , - and just , - and honest . I have known him several Years to behave true and honest . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 44 John Hickman , of St Leonard Shoreditch , was Indicted for feloniously making and causing to be made a certain false , forged , and counterfeit promissory Note , for the Sum of 56 l. & c. and for uttering and publishing the same , knowing it to be false , forged and counterfeit , July 27 . The Councel for the Prosecution having open 'd the Charge , the Witnesses were call 'd . Ann Sturk . The Prisoner is the Man . My acquaintance with him began , by his coming to Drink at my House , for at that Time , I kept a publick House . What he call 'd for , he paid for , and spent his Money pretty liberally , never insisting on Credit , nor ever borrowing Money of me . But hearing I was a Widow , he told me he had a Chest with a great many good Things in it coming Home in the Fleet with Sir John Norris , and he would bring it to me . He told me likewise , that he had got a Note upon Mr. Jasper of Tower-Hill , payable 2 Months after Date for 56 l. and if I would consent to Marry him , he would leave that with me . I refused him , but after many Persuasions , he left the Note with me , tho ' I told him , I had no Inclination to Marriage . He said , if I had any Occasion for Money , he would endorse the Note , and then I might make'use of it . I told him I should not want it , for I was supported other Ways , and if I went to Holland , as I believe I should , - I should have enough . Some Time after I resolved to go to Holland , so I left the Note with Mr. Peacock to take Care of it for him , but Mr. Peacock told me the Bill was a bad one , and if I did not produce the Man I had it of , I should come into Trouble . The Prisoner was then at Portsmouth , Mr. Peacock desiring to know how a Letter might be directed to him , we went to the House where he had lodged and enquired . The Woman told us , he was going a two Years Voyage , and we apprehended it would be very difficult to find him . But I set a Man to watch for him in the Neighbourhood , and he saw him come by that Evening ; he was going to make his Escape , and the Woman was following him . Q . Was he taken then ? Sturk . Yes ; and this is the Note I received of him . Q . Did he give it you as a real , true Note ? Sturk . Yes ; and he said if , I wanted Money , I might make use of it ; he told me , it was a Debt due to him from Squire Jasper ; but I refused to make use of it . Clerk reads the Note . At , or on the twienth Day of June , I promise to pay Jon Hickman , the Sum of Fifty-six Pounds Ster . for Value received , Witness my Hand . May 27 Tower-Hill . 56 l. Edwd Jasper . Tower-Hill . Thomas Chorley . I am Mr. Jasper 's Clerk , and am very well acquainted with his Hand writing . This Note I am sure is none of his Writing , it bears not the least Resemblance to any Writing of his , that ever I saw . Here is a Paper of Mr. Jasper 's Writing , this I know to be his Hand , and this forged Note is not at all like it . Q . How long have you liv 'd with Mr. Jasper ? Mr. Chorley . Seven Years . Councel . Was this forged Note brought to your Master ? Mr. Chorley . It was brought to his Office about the 25th of July last . A Lad brought it , and gave it into my Hand ; he asked me whether it was a good one , - whether it was Mr. Jasper 's ? I took no Notice that 't was bad , but only asked him , who he had it of . The Boy said it had been left by Mrs. Sturk , with his Father , ( Mr. Peacock ) and she desired to know if it was a good one . I told the Lad Mr. Jasper was out of Town , but that he was expected Home next Day ; so I desired him to leave it , and call again for my Master 's own Answer . I do n't know that the Boy called again , but next Evening a Man came to let us know that the Prisoner was apprehended . Sturk . I was at the taking of the Prisoner , and when I charged him , with this forged Note , the Constable bid him charge me , he did so , and we were both carried to Prison together . So I got much , by endeavouring to clear up this Matter , - I was sent to Jail with him . When the Prisoner was before the Justice , he did not deny his giving me the Note , and he could not say that Mr. Jasper owed him any Money . The Justice asked him , how he came by that Note ? He told him he did not know . The Justice . When he was before me , he own 'd the Note was in his Custody , but he could not give any Account how he came by it . I ca n't say he own 'd the Delivery of it to the Woman . Alexander Chorley . I liv 'd with Mr. Jasper about 3 Years , but have been gone from him about 3 Months . I know his Hand-writing , - I have seen him write an hundred Times ; I am satisfied this Note is not his Writing ; the other that has been compared with it , I do believe to be his own Writing . The Justice . Upon Recollection , he did own he left it with the Woman , and justify 'd himself , by saying he had not paid it away . Q . So the Prisoner made Application to you , by way of Marriage ? Sturk . Yes , and I told him I had no Inclination to marriage . C. 'T was well you was not enclin 'd to marriage at this Time , - you had a good Escape . Defence . I know nothing of it . I am a Stranger in Town , and by this Charge , have lost my Voyage , - I was never in London before . Please to enquire into this Woman 's Character . C. 'Twould stand you in more stead , to give a good Account of your own . Prisoner . My Lord I have no Witnesses . Guilty , Death . 45. William Jones , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 5 l. from the Person of Willoughbey Merchant , in the Parish of St. Katherine Creechurch , September 7 . Mr . Merchant . On Wednesday Night last , as I was going thro ' the Postern at Aldgate , the Prisoner and two more were quarrelling . I had not stepp 'd above two steps within the Postern , but I felt my Watch slip out of my Pocket . There was no one near me but the Prisoner , therefore I clapp 'd fast hold of him , and told him he was the Man . Another came up immediately , and cry 'd - what 's the Matter ? I imagined him to be one of his Companions , so I seized him too , and brought them both out , from under the Postern . I had no sooner got them out , but says the Prisoner , - see what you have done , and immediately I looked down , and pick 'd up the Watch from the Ground , between his Legs . Mr. Mann . I was going thro ' the Gate at this Time , and 2 or 3 Men were making a Quarrel ; as I shov 'd thro ' , I heard Mr . Merchant say , - you 're the Man . He seized him by the Collar , and was pulling him out , when another Man came up and made a Noise , upon which Mr . Merchant seized him too , and pull 'd them both out . The Prisoner dropp 'd the Watch upon the Ground , and said , - see what you have done , there 's the Watch . Upon my Oath I saw him drop it from between his Legs . Q . What Time was this ? Mr. Mann . 'T was about Seven o'Clock , or a quarter after ; I swear positively I saw him ( between the 2 Lights ) drop it from between his Legs , at the other End of the Passage . Q . What do you mean by the 2 Lights ? Mr. Mann . Between Day Light , and the Light of the Lamps ; there was Light enough to see it very plainly , between the Prisoner 's Legs . Constable . I was the Officer that took Charge of the Prisoner : the Gentleman had the Watch in his Hand , he charged the Prisoner with picking it out of his Pocket , and Mr Mann said he saw him drop it , - he said he saw it before it came to the Ground . Prisoner . The Gentleman took hold of another Man before he laid hold of me , and charg 'd him with picking his Pocket . A.Witness . The Prisoner is reckon 'd the Head of the Pick-pockets in my Neighbourhood - about Temple-Bar in general , every Shop-keeper thereabout knows him to be a Pick-pocket . Guilty . Death . 46 William Runnington , of Allhallows Honey-Lane , was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c . on William Reynolds did make an Assault , and a certain Knife made of Iron and Steel , value 6 d. at and against the Body of the said Reynolds did cast and throw , giving him a mortal Wound of the Length of one Inch , and the Depth of 2 Inches , on the right side of the Belly , near the Groin of the said Reynolds ; of which mortal Wound he languish 'd from the 24th to the 25th of August , and then died in the Parish of St. Bartholomew the Less . He was likewise charged by Vertue of an Inquisition taken by the Coroner . Sarah Williams . I was sent to Market on an Errand , and there I saw Watts the Butcher-woman tussling with the Prisoner , she held him with his Arms confin 'd a-cross , and his Back against the Wall . Another Butcher-woman standing by , bid the Deceased go and assist the Woman ; he went accordingly , and putting his Arms round the Woman 's Waste , he pull 'd her aside ; then he pushed the Prisoner to the outside of the Stall . Upon this , the Prisoner came up and struck the Deceased a Blow in his Face , and the Deceased pushed him by the Side of the Stall , on the outside . Then the Prisoner turn 'd round , and went behind the Stall , and took a Carver , and threw it at the Deceased . Q . How far was the Deceased from the Prisoner at this Time ? Williams . About 3 Yards . - The Prisoner took up the Knife by the Handle , and threw it directly at him , so it stabb 'd him on the right Side , - in his Bowels , a little above the Wastband of his Breeches . Counc . When the Deceased came to part the Prisoner and the Woman , did he tell him any Thing of his Design ? Williams . I did not hear him say any Thing at all . Q . Was the Prisoner striking the Woman ? Williams . No , she held him confin 'd , with his Back against the Wall . Q . How far was you from them when the Blow was given ? Williams . About 5 Yards . Elizabeth Sanney . When this Accident happen 'd I was at my Stall , about 10 Yards distant from the Place where the Deceased stood when he receiv 'd the Hurt . The Prisoner and Mrs. Watts were quarrelling and scolding , so she got up and struck the Prisoner several Blows , and held him up against the Wall . Upon this , the Deceased 's Mistress bid him go up and part them . Q . Was that said so loud that the Prisoner could hear it ? Sanney . I do n't know that . The Deceased went up to the Prisoner , and asked him how he could strike a Woman with Child ? Q . Did the Prisoner strike the Woman ? Sanney . I believe he did strike her once ; but whether the Deceased struck the Prisoner first , - or the Prisoner , - the Deceased , I ca n't tell . I saw the Deceased strike the Prisoner up against the Stall , when the Woman was sat down in her Chair ; her Stall is just a-cross the Row . Then the Prisoner turn 'd short , and snatch 'd up a Knife , and flung it at the Deceased ; he did not dart it , but flung it at him ; I did not see where it struck him , because I was in the Inside of my Stall . Counc . Do you know of any intimacy there was between the Prisoner and the Deceased ? Sanney . Yes , I can safely swear there was no Malice in the Case . Jury . We ask whether the Knife lay by the Prisoner , or whether he went from the Place where he stood to take it ? Sanney . I was very much surprized : but to the best of my Knowledge it lay by him . William White . I saw Watts beating the Prisoner , and he retired 3 or 4 Steps back against the Wall . Mrs. Smith the Deceased 's Mistress , bid him go and part them . Q . Did you observe how they stood together , when Smith bid the Deceased part them ? White . Yes , Watts struck him 2 or 3 Times inthe Face , then took hold of both his Hands , and held them cross his Breast , with his Back against the Wall , behind the Stall . The Deceased stepp 'd up to him , gave him a Push on the Breast , and said , what will you strike a Woman , - or a Woman with Child , and immediately the Woman withdrew , and the Deceased along with her . They were obliged to come through a little Passage from the Place where the Prisoner stood . The Woman went to her Stall , and the Deceas 'd turn 'd about and said something to the Prisoner ; upon which the Prisoner turn 'd about and catched up the Knife and flung it at him . I believe he might be 3 or 4 Yards from the Deceased when he did it ; there was not more than a Minute between the Woman 's retiring and the giving the Blow . Q . Did you see the Deceased do any Thing to the Prisoner after the Woman was retired . White . No , there was some Words passed between them I believe , but the Deceased never went near him after the Woman withdrew . I saw the Deceased draw the Knife out of his Body , just above the Wastband of his Breeches ; he dropt it down , then clapp 'd his Hands upon the Place and walk 'd by me directly . Q . Do you know of any Intimacy between them ? White . I believe but very few Days passed , wherein they did not eat and drink together . Counc . Did not the Deceased push the Prisoner after the Woman was gone ? White . No , he never came near him , and the Prisoner never stirr 'd a Yard from the Wall 'till the Knife was flung . Q . Did you hear the Words that passed between the Prisoner and the Deceased , after the Woman retir 'd ? White . I did not take Notice of them . The Prisoner was crying , ( weeping ) and the Knife lay at his left Hand , my Eyes were not off them 'till the Wound was given . Q . Did the Prisoner strike the Woman ? White . No , he did not strike her at all . Q . When the Deceased turn 'd , and the Words passed between him and the Prisoner , do you think he had any Intention to offer any Violence to the Prisoner ? White . No . Q . To Sanney . Did not you say you saw the Deceased strike the Prisoner up against the Stall after the Woman was retir 'd ? Sanney . Yes , I saw the Deceased strike the Prisoner after Watts was retir 'd , I think it was after , to the best of my Knowledge : He struck the Prisoner before the Knife was flung . Q. Mr. White says , the Deceased was not near enough to strike the Prisoner at all , and you say , he struck him up against the Stall . Sanney . Yes , after Watts retir 'd , the Deceased struck him , and before the Knife was thrown . Q . To Sarah Williams . Did you observe the Deceased strike the Prisoner after the Woman was gone ? Williams . No , the Deceased struck him in the Face , just at the Time that he put the Woman away . John Greatrex . I did not see the Quarrel begin but I stood at a Stall , and saw the Prisoner going in a great Passion behind his Stall , and the Deceased stepp 'd into the Passage , and gave the Prisoner a Shove , to hinder him from going by ; upon that , the Prisoner gave the Deceased a Blow , and the Deceased gave the Prisoner a Stroke on the Side of the Neck . Then the Prisoner brush 'd by the Deceased and catch 'd up the Carver that lay behind the Stall , and turn 'd himself about , and threw it over an empty Stall at the Deceased . This was all done in an Instant . Q . Was Watts there at that Time ? Greatrex . No . I believe the Thing was done in a Passion , for I have often seen the Prisoner and the Deceased eating and drinking together . Watts , the Butcher-woman . The Prisoner was saucy , so I slapp 'd his Chops ; then he call 'd me Names , and I follow 'd him behind the Stall and slapp 'd his Chops again , and held him with his Arms a-cross against the Wall : When I had done I ran directly to my Chair ; I do n't remember the Prisoner struck me at all . My Chair stood about 5 Yards from the Place where I beat the Prisoner , and I had not sat down a Moment , before I heard the Deceased shriek out ; I turn 'd to see what was the Matter , and saw the Knife drop down . The Deceased walked away , and I saw no more of it . Q . Did not you hear somebody speak to the Deceased to come to your Assistance ? Watts . I do n't remember it . Counc . Do n't you know that the Deceased and the Prisoner were intimate Friends ? Watts . They were always very great . I believe there was no Malice - only Heat and Passion , - they were like two Brothers . Counc . You say you did not hear any Body bid the Deceased come and help you ? Watts . No . Counc . Then consequently the Prisoner could not hear it . Ann Smith , the Deceased 's Mistress . Watts and the Prisoner were quarrelling , so I said to my Man ( the Deceased ) step up , he 'll do the foolish Woman a Mischief . I saw no more . Q . What Distance was you from the Place where the Deceased and the Prisoner were ? Ann Smith . About three Yards ; I saw the Deceased pull the Knife out of his Bowels . Counc . Was there any Intimacy between the Prisoner and the Deceased ? Smith . They were like 2 Brothers . The Surgeon The Patient was brought to me just after he received the Wound ; 't was upon the lower Part of the Belly , and was undoubtedly the Cause of his Death . Defence . That Woman - Watts , - came and slapp 'd me , and the Deceased took her Part and struck me , and call 'd me Son of a Bitch , - tho ' I lov 'd him as well as if he had been my own Brother , and as such we almost always eat and drank together . I have repented as much , since I did it , as if it had been my Father . Mr. White , Mrs. Sanney , and Mrs. Smith , gave the Prisoner the Character of an easy , innocent , honest Fellow . Mrs. Horton . The major Part of the Night , that the Deceased dyed , I sat up with him ( I am a Sister in St. Bartholomew 's Hospital . ) The Deceased pray 'd to God to forgive the Prisoner ; he said he was sure he did not do it willingly , and was very uneasy when he heard he was taken up , and blam 'd himself that he should meddle in Contentions that he had no Business with . The Jury Acquitted the Prisoner and found William Reynold 's Death , Accidental . 48. , of St. Clement Danes , Esq ; was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c on Ann Keate , Spinster , did make an Assault , and her against her Will , feloniously did Ravish , and carnally know . June 21 . Councel . We beg a Letter may be read that the Agent for the Prosecutor told me he wrote . To L - I H - y , Esq ; in Garden-Court , in the Temple . Sir , I was last Night sent to by a Client of mine to take Instructions for a Bill against you , for an Outrage of the blackest Dye , committed upon Ann Keate , and had an Information put into my Hands to that Purpose ; but in Regard to your being a Gentleman , I thought it better , to desire you might be sent to , before this was attempted , but it was deny 'd me ; however , if you will make any Overtures you may , if not I shall proceed . I am , & c. Q . To the Agent . What are these Overtures ? what do they mean Sir ? Agent . There was an Information put into my Hands , and I thought he would make some Application to her . Mrs. Keate . On the 24th of June , about 7 or 8 o'Clock in the Evening , I was going from Fountain-Court in the Strand , to the Old Bailey , for a Bottle of Daffey 's Elixir , for this Gentlewoman 's ( Mrs. Mitchel 's ) Child ; I live in her House . - Q. Pray what Business is that Gentlewoman ? Mrs. Keate . A Widow , and she has an Annuity . I live with her , - but not as a Servant , - I keep my self , and can give an Account - how I have 30 l. a Year , of my own . As I was going along , my Foot stumbled , and this Gentleman came after me , and asked me where I was going ? What 's that to you says I . Why my Dear , I have had a terrible Misfortune ; I have had a Girl that has jilted me and used me ill : and he desired me to take a Glass of Wine with him . I told him , I would not go with him . Then he asked me where I was going ? I told him to the Old Bailey . He said he would not let me go , 'till I had taken a Glass of Wine with him . He promised he would not molest me , and went all the Way to the Old-Bailey with me . When I got there , I went into a House , and I thought I should have lost him , - but when I came out again , - there was he waiting for me , and still said he would not leave me , 'till he had drank a Glass of Wine with me , and so he follow 'd me to the Ship Tavern by Temple-Bar ; at the Corner of Butcher-Row , pray , says he , go in and drink , - we 'll sit in the publick Kitchen , or wherever you please ; and says he , if I am rude , - keep this , ( pulling a very handsome Diamond Ring off his Finger . ) So - I went into a publick Room with him , and there he told me , if I would go down into the Country with him , he would marry me , to spite his Girl , who had gone and marry 'd his Plow-Fellow And says he , if you 'll consent to go down , you shall go with me to my Chambers to Night . But pray , says he , whenever you come to me , be sure to be dress 'd very fine , that my Servants may tell her , and that will make her mad . I told him I could not lye out of my Lodgings all Night ; why then says he , come To-morrow Morning . When we come out of the Tavern , he call 'd a Chair to carry me Home , and the Chairmen instead of carrying me Home , - they carried to - another Place . Why Fellows , says I , I did not bid you bring me Here ! But damn them , says he , I did . Q . What Time of Night was it , when he met you : Keate . Not quite Eight o'Clock . Q . How many Pints of Wine did you drink ? Keate . I ca n't tell . But we staid at the Tavern 'till about 10 o'Clock . Q. Pray where did the Chairmen carry you ? Keate Into a very long Room , - an Entry , in Garden Court . When the Men lifted up the Top of the Chair , I told them I did not live there . The Prisoner told them I did , and took the Candle from them , and so made me go up 2 pair of Stairs , and shew 'd the Gold Watches , Silver Salvers , and a great many fine Things , which he said he would give me , if I would lye with him . Then he brought out Shrub and several Bottles of Wine , and would have me drink ; I insisted upon going Home , but he would not let me . - I have a great Cut here , - which I got by his flinging me out of Bed . When he had stripp 'd himself , he told me if I would not strip my self , he would , or he would send for Porters that should do it for me , - and all this while I begg 'd and pray 'd he would let me go Home , but he would not let me . Q . And was not you prevail 'd upon at last ? Keate . No . He tore off my Gown and my Shoes and Stockings , but my Petticoats were none of them pull 'd off . Q . Well , and what was next ? Keate . I ca n't speak it in Court - for all the World . Q . When you found your self in Garden-Court , with all this prodigious unwillingness , why did you not complain ? Why did you suffer your self to be carry 'd up 2 pair of Stairs ? Keate . He took the Candle from the Chairmen and it went out before we got up Stairs ; but when we came into his Room he struck a Light with a Thing like a Pistol . Q . When you was in his Room , why did not you cry out ? Keate . I did break a pane of Glass , but he told me no Body would hear me if I did cry out . He used me in a very barbarous Manner , but I ca n't tell it for ever so much . Mrs. Mitchel . Miss Keate came Home crying the next Day , after this happen 'd , about 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon . Miss Nanny , says I , What is the matter with you ? What made you stay out all Night Child ? Do n't ask me , says she , and fell into a violent Passion of crying , and so went to Bed . Q . When was any Information given to a Justice of the Peace ? Keate . I employed a Man to get a Judges Warrant , and gave him a Guinea to do it , but he run away with the Money . A Witness . I went to the Prisoner 's Chambers the next Day . Counc . I believe you have been there often enough to see for Overtures . The Prisoner was Acquitted , and the Court granted him a Copy of his Indictment . 49 , was indicted for stealing 7 Linnen Sheets , 5 damask Table cloths , 8 Pillowbiers , 4 Napkins , 19 linnen Dusters , 18 Window curtains , a pair of brass Candlesticks , an iron Shovel and a pair of Tongs ; the Goods of Paul Harris , in the Parish of St. Christopher 's , August , 29 . Mr. Harris . The Prisoner was my Servant when this Robbery was committed . Another of my Servants having given me Information , that the Prisoner had carried 2 or 3 Bundles out of my House ; I took the Informer with me to the House where she said the Things were lodged , and there I found the Linnen mentioned in the Indictment , and several other Things . Five bundles I found at one John Fisher 's ; at Alice Gibbon 's , I found a pair of brass Candlesticks , Shovel and Tongs . I charged the Prisoner with taking these Things , and she own 'd the Fact , in hopes that I would shew her Mercy . I did not promise to shew her any Favour , yet she confessed it before Sir Richard Brocas . I must say that I had not the least suspicion of her , 'till I received the Information from her Fellow-Servant , and except this Fact , I know nothing against her . Mary Penston . About the 27 of July , the Prisoner asked me to carry a parcel of broken China , and a bundle of Clouts into Broad St. Giles 's , I carry 'd them there , but I never saw them open 'd , 'till my Master and I went together to ask for them .

John Fisher The Prisoner and her Fellow-Servant came to my House one Day , and told me she was going to House-keeping , and so desired to leave some Goods with me .

The Prisoner and her Fellow-Servant brought some Things to my House , and among them , there was a Bedstead and a porrage Pot , a pair of Candlesticks , a Grate , a Shovel and Tongs : I imagin 'd she had bought them , and chid her for buying such Trumpery .

And I had the Things in it , from John Fisher 's and Alice Gibbon 's . Prisoner . I know of no more than 2 Bundles , the rest Penstone carry 'd out her self .

I was busy in the Parlour with a Man that came to see my Maid , so she went up Stairs to fetch down the Prisoner 's Petticoat , and in the mean Time she found Means to convey away the Suit of Cloaths . I did not miss them 'till next Morning , and then I imagin 'd my Maid had put them away ; but soon after I missed the Things , the Prisoner came in , and told me that she had met with a rich Uncle , who had given her 3 Guineas , and she was so full of Money , that she gave me 15 s. for a Gown that was forfeited , and hung up for Sale . This gave me a Suspicion that the Prisoner was a Thief ; so I got a Warrant from Justice Poulson and took her before him ; there she own 'd that she had pawn 'd the Things , but she said she had them from a Woman in Hatton-Garden . The Justice asked her , where this Woman , and her rich Uncle and Aunt were to be found ?

At one Mrs. Aris 's in Baldwin's-Gardens . Rebecca Aris . The Prisoner pledged these Goods with me for 3 Guineas and a half , the 31st of May . She told me they belonged to a Gentlewoman in Hatton-Garden , who was sick , and was straiten 'd for Money , and that when she was well she would fetch them again . I saw the Cloaths were very good , therefore I refused to receive them unless she could give an Account of her self ; upon this , she carry 'd me to one Mrs. Hale , who keeps a Potter 's Shop in the Neighbourhood , and Mrs. Hale told me , I might safely lend her the Money . I let her have it accordingly , and kept the Cloaths 'till the People came to enquire for them , and I deliver 'd them to the Constable . Mr. Cook , Constable .

About a Week after the Prosecutrix was robb 'd , we found the Candlestick and the Glass at Bushnel 's , and nothing more , for the Constable did not search carefully ; he open 'd no Boxes nor Drawers . Roberts . Bushnel informed us , she had the Goods of the Prisoner , and the Prisoner when she was before Justice Mercer own 'd she took them . John Freeman .

At Night I went to my new Lodging , and at a proper Time I handed the Things out to them - they waited at the Door for them .

Some Company coming in , I put it into the Cupboard again , and stepp 'd into the Parlour , when I came back the Prisoner and his Company were gone , and the Watch too . Susannah Coomer . I saw the Prisoner have the Watch in his Hand the Day that 't was lost ; he took up the Flat of his Coat , as if he would have put it into his Pocket , and said , - if I was to take this Watch , I 'll be d - n 'd if Hollis would know it again . I went into the Parlour , and saw no more of it . About a Week after , as I was going with Hollis 's Daughter to School , I met the Prisoner in a Lane , and he asked me if I was to return Home that Night ? I told him I could not tell . Because says he , if you were going to London , you may see a Man who will produce Mr. Hollis 's Watch ; but at present , 't is in a Woman 's Hands . Defence . William Fowler . I have known the Prisoner too long ; ever since he was 14 Years old . He is my Sister 's Son , - a poor unfortunate Fellow , and what makes him more so , he 's eternally drunk .
