They left their Tools there on Saturday Night , and lock 'd the Door ; but when they came again on Monday Morning , the Door was open , the Lock taken off , and their Tools were gone . They could not Work without them , and so they went to the Alehouse ; while they were there , the Prisoner Lightfoot came into a Hog-butchers Yard with 2 Axes , and an Iron Square , which he set down by a Tub , and went out again , without saying any thing . The Hog-butcher 's Men at first thought that the Capenters were coming there to work ; but seeing Lightfoot come again , and saunter about the Gate , one of them said , I believe that Fellow is a Thief , upon which Lightfoot curs 'd and swore , and went off . When presently a Man came , and said , a Parcel of Carpenters Tools were stolen out of a House in Well-Close-Square . The Butchers went out , and saw the other Prisoner Spaule , in a Leather-Apron , and with a Nail Bag at his Back . The Butchers and the other Man divided themselves , and follow 'd the Prisoners at a Distance , in order to surround 'em unawares .

After I had lost my Goods , the Prisoner was taken up by my Ld Pembroke 's Steward , for stealing a Lac'd-head , and when she was before the Justice I got a Warrant to search her Room in the Hay-Market , and there I found this Tea-spoon ; she own 'd that she had pawn 'd a Nutmeg-grater . Edward Hodges . The Prisoner brought this Grater to my Father 's House , and I lent her 4 s. on it . Elizabeth Ellis . The Grater and Spoon have no Marks , and therefore I wont take upon me to swear they are mine . Ann Rose . I believe the Spoon to be my Mistress ( Mrs. Ellis 's ) and I know the Grater to be hers by these Dents . Prisoner . The Spoon and Grater were my own , as well as a great many other handsome Things that I had about me , for I am none of your poor beggarly inferior sort of People .

Catherine Fitz-Williams . On the Friday before the last Birth-Day , as I was at Work at Mrs. Laserre 's , the Prisoner came in , and pulling this Brussel Lace Head and Tucker out of her Pocket , she ask 'd Mrs. Laserre if she knew any Body that would buy it ; she said the Price was 14 Guineas , and that she had it from Mrs. Weaver , my Lady Shelurn 's Woman . Mrs. Peach , my Lady Pembrok 's Woman hearing of it , came to Mrs. Laserre 's , and said , her Lady had lost a Head . Mrs. Laserre sent me to the Prisoner to tell her that a Gentlewoman waited to see the Head , and if she liked it , and the Price , she might be a Customer . I went and fetch 'd it , and Mrs. Peach said , she 'd swear that that was her Lady 's Head ; she put it in her Pocket , and went with me to the Prisoner , who told her the lowest Price was twelve Guineas . Catherine Peack . I went with Mrs. Fitz . Williams to the Prisoner 's Lodgings , under pretence of buying the Head . I hear , says I , that you have a fine Head to dispose off ; Yes , says the Prisoner . And what 's the Price ? Twelve Guineas . Will not Eight do ? No . Then the Constable ( who waited below ) came up . Prisoner . I went to see a Gentlewoman of my Acquaintance , who gave me the Head to dispose off for her . I knew of no Body so proper to apply to on that Occasion as Mrs. Laserre my Mantua-maker , and I told her who I had it from . Fitz-Williams has known me these five Years . Fitz-Williams . Yes , I have so , and I ca n't say that I ever knew any harm of her before . She told me that my Lady Shelburn was dead , and had left all her Cloaths to her Woman , from whom she had this Head . Hannah Williams . The same Day that the Head was lost , and a little before we miss 'd it , the Prisoner came to my Lord Pembroke 's House , and ask 'd for Mrs. Peach , my Lady 's Woman , and I directed her Upstairs . Court , to the Prisoner . Have you any Witnesses ? Prisoner . Yes , but I have had no Opportunity of sending for them . I happen 'd to get out of Newgate before last Sessions , and since I was taken again , I have been kept close Prisoner in the Condemn 'd Hold , and none of my Friends have been allowed to come to me . Court . Then you have broke Jail it seems . The Keeper had reason to take Care of you . Prisoner . Broke Jail ! No , I only went out . Mr. Nichols . She made her escape , disguis 'd in the Cloaths of a Woman who came frequently to her in Prison . She was taken up for another Felony , and we secur 'd her in the Condemn 'd Hold ; but none of her Acquaintance were deny 'd the Liberty of speaking with her . The Jury found her Guilty to the Value of 39 s. 6. Elizabeth Holms , alias Pratt , was indicted , and Mary Brudenell , alias Bradley , was a third time indicted for breaking and entring the House of James Jackson in White-Chappel Parish , on the 25th of April last , about Three in the Afternoon , his Wife Mary Jackson being then therein , and stealing a Silver Spoon , value 15 s. the Goods of a Person unknown ; 3 Silver Thimbles , a Silk Handkerchief , a Cambrick Apron , and other Goods , and 3 Guineas , 2 half Guineas , and 35 s. the Goods and Money of James Jackson . Mary Jackson . I keep a Linen Shop in White-Lion-street in Goodman's-Fields , one end of the Street comes into Rosemary-Lane . The Prisoners came to Lodge at my House for a Day or two , pretending they were going to Holland with Captain Allen , and only waited for the Ship 's Sailing . They were recommended to me by Mr. Baily , my next Door Neighbour . About Noon I had Occasion to look in my Drawers , and I saw my Money and Goods were there . I lock 'd my Chamber Door , and came down Stairs . The Prisoners lay in the next Chamber to mine . In the Afternoon a Man came to them from Mr. Baily 's , and went and fetch 'd a Coach ; they came down , and paid me 5 s. for five Days Lodging , and then they all three went into the Coach , and one of them bid the Coachman drive to St. James's-street . About Ten at Night I went up to Bed , and opening the Drawer to put some Money in , I found I had been Robb 'd . The Spoon I had lost was none of my own , I had lent 10 s. on it . Mr. Baily . I keep the White-Lyon Alehouse . Thomas Maccartney ( with whom I had some Acquaintance ) brought the Prisoners to my House to get a Lodging for them . Bradley went for the Mistress , and Holms for the Maid . The Mistress had ( as she still has ) a sort of a scurvy Humour broke out in her Face ; she said it came by a Surfeit that she got with Dancing , and that she was going for Holland , to try if drinking the Waters at the Spaw would do her any good . I could not spare Lodging-Room at my House for any more than Maccartney , and so I recommended the Prisoners to Mrs. Jackson for a Bed ; but they used to eat and drink at my House , for which in 5 Days they run up 18 s. I saw no Money they had till just before they took Coach , and then Bradley gave me 2 Half-Guineas to take my Reckoning , out of which I did , and returned her 3 s. Maccartney fetch 'd a Coach , and he and the 2 Prisoners went in , and Bradley bid the Coachman drive to St. James's-street directly . As it happened , I took so much Notice of the Coachman as to know him again ; he wore a blue Coat ; he was lame in one Foot , and his Shoe was cut to give it Ease . About 10 at Night , Mrs. Jackson came and told me she was robb 'd , and I went next Morning in search after the Coachman , and at last I found him at the Saracen 's Head in Camomile-street . I ask 'd him to what Place he drove those two Women and the Man ? he said at first that he did not care to tell me , because they had charged him not to let me know , if he happened to see me . But after a little Talk with him , he said , Well , Master , you look like a good honest Man , and if you 'll give me a Pot I 'll tell you . I call 'd for a Pot of Beer , and then he told me , that when he had carried them a little way , they order 'd him to drive to Billinsgate , where they took Water for Greenwich . I told Mrs. Jackson of this , she went with me , and we found out the Waterman who carried them , and went with him to Greenwich . He brought us to the Porter who had help 'd them to a Lodging . Mrs. Jackson went to a Justice for a Warrant , and as she was coming back , Maccartney happened to see her , upon which he ran to the Waterside , took Oars for London , and escaped . We went to the Prisoners Room , and met with 'em both . We searched 'em , but could find nothing about 'em that Mrs. Jackson could swear to but this Shilling . Mrs. Jackson . I know this Shilling to be Part of the Money that I lost out of my Drawer ; it looks blackish , I suppose it had lain in Gun-powder before I took it ; I remember I scupled it and made this Scratch to see if it was good , and besides , here 's a little Dent just by the Edge . Bradley , the Prisoner . After I got out of Newgate . I met with Holms , and we went to a Friend 's House , and enquired for a Lodging . A Woman who was there told us , that her Brother Macartney had an Acquaintance who kept an Ale-house , in White-Lyon-street , by Rag-Fair , at which House she believed we might lye ; but when we came thither , there was not Room for us , but Mr. Baily , the Man of the House , provided us a Lodging at the Prosecutor 's , who lived next Door to him . Mrs. Holms and I had agreed to go to Holland with Capt . Allen , but while we waited for the Ship 's setting Sail , we happened to quarrel , and she threatned to tell Mrs. Jackson that I came out of Newgate , upon which I was resolv 'd to leave that Lodging . Court . Why did you at first order the Coachman to go to St. James 's , and as soon as you were got out of the Prosecutor 's Hearing , bid him drive to Billingsgate ? Bradley . Because at first Mrs. Holms intended t o go to her Sister in St. James 's , but soon after she chang 'd her mind , and was willing to go with me . The Jury acquitted Holms , and found Bradley guilty to the Value of 1 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7.

Sarah Squib . Last August was 2 Years , I was Servant to my Lady Mountague , and was left in the House , at Board Wages , to look after it . As I was sitting at the Parlour Window , Katherine Newman , a Neighbour ( whom I always thought to be a very honest Woman ) came and desired me to let a young Woman , just come out of the Country , lie with me for 2 or 3 Nights , till she could provide herself with a Place . I told her , I could by no means suffer any such thing , for People would say , that I let out my Lady 's House in Lodgings when she was from Home . But Mrs. Newman would take no Denial , and so at last she over-persuaded , and brought the Prisoner . The Prisoner staid with me 2 Days , and in that time she told me as many Lies as this Court would hold , though I believ 'd them all at first . She said that she had liv 'd at 'Squire Goare 's in Great Monmouth-street 3 Years , that her Father and Mother had kept the George-Inn in Northampton , but were lately dead , and had left all they had betwixt her and her Brother , who was Master of a Stage-Coach at the Brook-Bar in Holborn . There was not a Lady that past by the Window with any thing rich in her Dress , but this Creature told me that she had got such another . On the 2d Day she was with me , I left her within , and went out to St. James Market to get something for Dinne , I staid about 2 Hours , and when I came back I found her standing at the Door . She said , a Girl had been these to tell her of a Place , and she was going to see it , and desired me not to go to Dinner till she came back , but I never saw her impudent Face any more till she was taken up . I soon found she had robbed the House , and I went to enquire after her at 'Squire Goare 's , but could hear nothing of her there . I was directed to one Mrs. Banister , with whom she had liv 'd , and whose Name she took upon her self when she came to me . By her means I heard the Prisoner was gone to Service at Mrs. Duncan 's Boarding-School at Islington ; I went thither , but it was too late , she had lived there but 3 Weeks , and then was discharged . At last I found her at one Goddard 's in St. Mary lx , where she had met with a Husband . I was told that she robbed Mrs. Kirby before she robbed me . Katherine Newman . The Prisoner told me the same Stories as she told the Prosecutor , and I thought her an honest Country Maid , and therefore I recommended her to lie a Night or two with the Prosecutor . Prisoner . I never was at the Lady Mountague 's House in my Life , and this Prosecution is set on Foot by my Husband 's Relations , on purpose to get rid of me . James Goddard . I have known the Prisoner a Year , and trusted her in my House with valuable Things , for my Wife takes in Linen to wash for Ladies , and we never mist any thing The Girl has unhappily married the Son of a topping Man ( Dr. Pickering of Tunbridge , who keeps his Coach and four ) as soon as her Husband 's Relations heard of it , he was turned out of Doors , and was forced for a Livelihood to draw Beer at the George-Alehouse in St. Mary Ax ; but he is lately gone Abroad . Court . In what manner ? Goddard . To travel as a Gentleman ; his Friends have sent him away to keep him from his Wife . The Jury acquitted her . 8 , 9. John Osborn , and John Longmore , were indicted for assaulting John Elliot in an open Field near the Highway , in the Parish of Stepney , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Hat , a Wig , a Coat , a Waistcoat , a pair of Shoes , and a pair of Buckles , and 5 d. in Money . the 10th of April last . At the Prisoners Desire the Witnesses were examined apart . John Elliot . On Easter-Monday at Night , about 10 o'Clock , as I was going from Stepney towards Shadwell ; I was followed by 4 Men , and in Sun-Tavern-Fields , one of 'em came up , flash 'd a Pistol close to my Ear , and bid me stand , and presently the others came about me , searched my Pockets , and took out 5 d. robbed me of my Hat and Wig , stripped off my Coat and Waistcoat , and then pushed me down , and pulled off my Shoes . I was getting up again , when one who stood behind me , knocked me down , and the Prisoner , Osborn , whom I knew ( for I had seen him 2 or 3 times before ) stabbed me in the hand with a Knife , and then they went off , and I got up again , to Hopes they were quite gone ; but presently I heard one of them say , Damn him , he knows I 'll give him a home thrust ; and then somebody came trip , trip , behind me , and turning about I saw it was Osborn . He stept up , and stuck me in the Breast with a Knife . I fell down , and so he left me again . Two Men came to me in a little while after , I was afraid they were some of the same Gang , who were come to see if I was alive still , so that when they called to me I made no Answer at first , but I soon found they were Friends , they took Care of me , and led me home . Court . Do you know if Longmire was one of those that attack 'd you ? Elliot . I knew none of them but Osborn . William Fleming . The two Prisoners , and Jemmy Tripland , and I were drinking at a House in Stepney , where the Prosecutor was drinking too ; about 10 at Night he went to the Door , and we followed , though with no Thoughts of robbing him ; for we had a Design upon another Man who was going over the Fields . But the Prosecutor sitting down upon the Bench at the Door with some others , he told them , that he had not spent all his Money yet , for he had enough left to pay for a Crown Bowl of Punch . Upon hearing this , we concluded that he was the fittest Man for our Purpose . It was not long before he got up , and went away in Company with 3 Men and 2 Women . We followed at a Distance till his Company parted with him , and then mending our Pace , we came up to him in Sun-Tavern-Fields and stapp 'd him ; we took some Half pence from him , and his Hat and Wig , and Coat and Waistcoat , and Shoes ; we knock 'd him down , and Osborn stabb 'd him in the Hand , and so we left him , and were going quite away , but Osborn said , Damn him , he knows me , I 'll go buk and give him another Stab ; and so he did . As we were going off we met 2 Men who went towards the Prosecutor , I followed them as far as to where the Prosecutor lay , and asked what was the Matter , they said , Matter enough ; a Man had been robb 'd ; and so I left 'em , and went again to my Companions . Osborn pull 'd off his own ragged Coat , and left it in Stepney-Fields , and put on that as we took from the Prosecutor . His Wife afterwards sold the Coat and Waistcoat in Chick-Lane , but she would never tell us what she did with the Hat and Wig . I was apprehended first , and on my Information the others were taken up . Ann Bond . This Coat and Waistcoat were all bloody when I first saw them at Osborn 's House , and his Wife ask 'd me to go with her to sell them . - Townsend , Constable . I found this Coat and Waistcoat at Macdowall 's in Chick-Lane , he delivered them to me readily . William Jacobs . I and another were going over Sun-Tavern-Fields , just after the Robbery , 3 Men ran by us ; my Friend said , They seem to be in a plaguy Hurry . Ah , says I , they have over staid their time I suppose . Going forward , we saw something white at a little Distance ; we stept up and found a Man lying in his Shirt ; we call 'd , but he made no Answer , for I suppose he was afraid to speak , but we soon satisfied him that we were Friends . I lent him my Hat and my Coat , and we led him Home to Shadwell-Market . Court to Fleming . Which of you attack 'd the Prosecutor first ? Fleming . Tripland , and then I took his Money and his Shoes , Longmore took his Hat and Wig , and Osborn took his Coat and Waistcoat , but gave them Tripland to hold while he went back to stab the Prosecutor . Osborn . I never saw Fleming nor the Prosecutor in my Life , before I was taken up for this Robbery . Longmore . I came from on board a Ship but that same Night , and I had no Acquaintance with Fleming . Fleming . We were altogether at Stepney all that Day . Elizabeth Longmore . My Son , Longmore , was mostly at Home all that Monday . Court . At what time was he at Home in the Evening ? Elizabeth Longmore . I think he came Home about 7 or 8 , and I do n't know that he went out again that Night . Court . How came you to remember that it was the same Night as the Robbery was committed ? E. L. Because it was Easter-Monday . Court . And where was he on Tuesday Night ? E. L. I do n't remember . Court . And why ca n't you remember one as well as t'other . E. L. I believe he might be at Home then too ; but he is a harmless , half-witted , foolish Lad . The Jury acquitted Longmore , and found Osborn guilty of the Indictment . Death . 8 , 9 . John Osborn , and John Longmore , were a 2d time indicted for assaulting Joseph Allam in an open Field near the Highway , in the Parish of Stepney , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Wig , a Cloth Coat and Waistcoat , a Woollen Waistcoat , a Shirt , a Pair of Holland Sleeves with Cambrick Ruffles , a pair of Shoes , a pair of Buckles , and a pair of Gloves , and 15 d. in Money , Apr . 12 . 10 .

Joseph Allam . On the 12th of April , about 10 at Night , I was got pretty well in for't , and was going Home ; and by the way I met some of these Gentlemen . Court . What Gentlemen ? Allam . The Prisoners . Court . Look at 'em , are you sure that they were any of the Gentlemen ? Allam . No , I do n't know who they were , but I was seduced by somebody or other that pretended out of Kindness to shew me a higher way Home , and when they got me into the Fields , they stripp 'd me of my Coat and Waistcoat , and Shirt , and Wig , and Shoes , and Sleeves , but I do n't know whether they took any Money from me , or whether I had any about me . William Fleming . I and Jemmy Tripland , and Osborn and Longmore , met Moll James and Black Peg in Ratcliff-Highway ; they shew 'd us a Hat , and said they had just taken it from a Man that was drunk , and bid us go after him ; we went , and the two Women with us , and they would fain have got him into a Baudy-house , at the Three Tobacco-Rolls and Sugar-Loaf , but we would not let them . Osborn knew the Man , and said , that he kept a Boarding-School at Poplar , and so telling him we 'd take care of him , and shew him the nighest way Home ; Osborn took him under one Arm , and I under the other , and led him into the Fields ; Osborn thrust a Handkerchief into his Mouth , and then we two stripp 'd him naked , while Tripland and Longmore stood at a Distance to watch , and then help 'd us to carry the Cloaths to the Black-Boy in Well-Street , and there Osborn gave them all but the Buckles to his Wife , Mary Angel , alias Osborn ( the other Prisoner ) to sell for us ; Longmore kept the Buckles himself , and he has them now in his Shoes . Court . Let the Prosecutor see those Buckles . Prosecutor . I ca n't swear to the Buckles . Fleming . Mary Angel sold the Cloaths in Chick-Lane , but she sunk part of the Money , and gave us but 8 s. 6 d. for the Coat and Waistcoat , and 2 s. for the Shoes ( they were Wooden-heel 'd Shoes , and 1 s. she spent . We shared the Money equally , and had Half-a-Crown a-piece . Court . Four Half Crowns are but 10s . and you say she gave you 10s . 6d . Fleming . Then I mistook 6 d. she gave us but 8 s. for the Coat and Waistcoat . I made the Discovery the last Day of last Sessions , and sent for the Prosecutor . James Tripland . We met the Prosecutor in Ratcliff-Highway , Fleming and Osborn pretended to be his Friends , and led him into the Fields and suppos 'd him , while I and Longmore stood at a lift Distance to watch . We carried the Things : the Black-Boy in Well-street , where Osborn gave them to Angel , and she sold 'em , and gave us 6 s. for the Coat and Waistcoat , and 2 s. for the Shoes . The Cloaths were worth Half-a-Guinea , but she sunk the rest of the Money . We divided the Money , Share and Share alike , and had Half-a-Crown a piece . Court . What out of 6 s. and 2 s ? Tripland . Six Shillings ! No , I believe it was 6 s. 6 d. Court . And that with the 2 s. makes but 8 s. 6 d. how then could 4 of you divide Half-a Crown a-piece ? Tripland . A Mistake of 6 d. will break no Damage . Court . But Fleming says it was 8 s. she gave you for the Coat and Waistcoat . Prisoner Osborn . Tripland was convicted here and transported 5 Years ago , by the Name of James Ogborn . Tripland . 'T is no such thing ; I sold my self indeed 7 Years ago at the Black-Boy on London-Bridge . Osborn . I own I am guilty of the Fact , and desire to dye for it ; but Longmore is innocent . Prisoner Longmore . I was on board a Ship when the Fact was committed . Court . Call your Witnesses to prove it . Longmore . The Ship is now failed , and my Witnesses are in it , but I have some to my Reputation . Peter Andrews . I have known Longmore six Years , he liv 'd with his Mother , who sells old Cloaths , and I never heard any Harm of him before . Edmund Newsham . I have known him ten Years , he and his Mother lodg 'd in my Room ; I never heard any Ill of him , he always kept good Hours , and had the Character of an honest , just Man . Court . Did you never hear that he was committed for a Robbery before this ? Newsham . Yes ; he was sent to New-Prison once on Suspicion of a Robbery , but no Body appeared against him . Court . And yet you could swear that you never heard any Ill of him . Arthur Bernfree . I have known him three Years , he used the Sea , and had the Character of an honest Fellow ; but I have heard some Suspicions of him . Fleming . When Osborn gave the Coat to Mary Angel it was a little bloody , and she wash 'd it before she sold it , and chaulked the Wig . She gave us 6 s. at first , and then 3 s. and afterward , 1 s. more , which she told us she had sunk . Court . You said before that she gave you 8 s. at first . Fleming .

Neither , but being in the open Field it was Light enough , I could see his Face as plain as I do now , and he own 'd the Money before Justice Philips , but said he knew nothing of the Watch ; and that if there was a Watch , his Companions had sunk it from him . Sunk is a Term of Art among them for conceal 'd . Mr. Philips . When the Prosecutor was before me , he said he believ 'd the Prisoner was one of them , but was not positive . He described the Prisoner to be such a sort of a Man , but could not then swear to him directly . Panton . Nine Days after I was first before the Justice , he sent for me from my own House , and told me that the Prisoner had own 'd to him that he had my Money , but not my Watch , for the Man who had it was not taken . Mr. Philips . The Prosecutor is a little mistaken in that particular , I did not say that the Prisoner told me that he had the Money , but that one of the Gang , who was in Newgate , told me , that the Prisoner told him that he had the Money . Samuel Case . As I and the Prosecutor were going together on the 21st of April , he saw the Prisoner standing in the Street , and said to me , That 's the Man ; and so we took him up , and charged a Constable with him . Prisoner . I work 'd on board a Ship from the 16th to the 25th of April , and came Home every Night . Alexander Johnson . I never heard any thing worse of the Prisoner , than that he was an ignorant , literate , silly Fellow . James Cunningham . He is an innocent foolish Boy , but I never heard that he was guilty of any other Misdemeanour . Two or three other Witnesses swore that they knew no harm of him . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 12. Robert Roberts , alias Robertson , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of Henry Watkins in Shoreditch Parish , and stealing a Feather Bed , a Bolster , a pair of Sheets , a Porridge Pot , a Pewter Dish , a Plate , two Sauce-pans , three Candlesticks , a Chasing-Dish , a Pepper Box , a Drudging Box , a Bottle , and two Handkerchiefs , April 26 . about the Hour of Two in the Night-time . Henry Watkins . I made fast my Doors and Windows about Ten at Night , and went to Bed . I was called up between Four and Five next Morning , and found my back Window was broke so as a Man might get in . My fore Window-shutter was unbarr 'd , and the Casement open . I miss 'd my Goods . Mr. Brown afterwards inform 'd me that some such Goods as I had lost had been offer 'd to Sale in the Neighbourhood by the Prisoner . I got a Warrant and searched the Prisoner 's Lodging . I found these 2 Handkerchiefs in his Pocket ; my Bed , and these two Plates in his Room . On farther Information , I found more of my Goods in Hog-lane , where they had been sold by the Prisoner . James Parker . This Chasing dish and Frying-pan I bought of the Prisoner . A Man whom I knew came with him to my House . Prisoner . I own that I had these Goods , but I knew nothing of their being stolen , for as soon as I waked in the Morning , I found 'em all in my own Room . Court . You had extraordinary Luck ! But how happen 'd it that you never enquir 'd who they belong 'd to ? Prisoner . I thought they had been my own . Court . Your own ? And how did you think you came by them ? Prisoner . My Wife deals in such Things . She and I had some Words over Night , and so she ran away from me , and I thought that she had left them behind her . Constable . I found this little Saw , and this stubbed Knife in his Pocket . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 13 John Wakelin was indicted for breaking and entring the House of John Richards , in the Parish of St. Margarets Westminster , and stealing 64 Guineas , a half Board-piece , val . 11 s. 6 d. a Leather Pocket , value one Half-penny , and 2 Mole-skins of no value , the 23d of February last , about the Hour of 9 in the Morning , no person then being in the House . John Richards . I live in Ship-Yard in Petty-France , Westminster . On the 23d of February , being Ash-Wednesday , about 9 in the Morning , I made fast my Door , and went out with my Wife to Leaden-Hall-Market , leaving no Body in the House . I return 'd about Noon , and found my Back-Door open , and the Staple was forced off , my Drawers were broke , and my Money which I had left in these 2 Mole-Skins was gone . I suspected the Prisoner , having heard that he had broke open a House before . I went to an Alehouse that he frequented , and was told , that he had that Morning chang 'd half a Guinea there , to pay a Crown that he had scor 'd , and that he had hir 'd a Hackney-Coach to carry him to Highgate . At Highgate I met a Man that went in the Coach with him , and he told me that the Prisoner gave the Coachman a Guinea . I heard of him all along the Road to Hackney-Common , and that from thence he went in a Waggon for Bigglesworth in Bedsordshire . I follow 'd him thither , and heard that he had given a Guinea for a Horse to Eston , which is 7 Miles . I got to Eaton early on Friday Morning , and found him at the Cock , I thought it was the best Sight that ever I had seen ; he was standing at the Door with a Pint of Ale in his Hand , there 's special gol Ale at the Cock ! he had a Suit of Cloth on his Back that he stole at the same time as he took my Money . I asked him how he could serve me so , to take away all that I had ? He paused a little and said , he was very sorry for what he had done . I went in with him , he gave me back my Mole Skins , with 45 Guineas , and some Silver , and told me , that it was all that he had left . I asked him what he had done with the rest , he said , he had spent it , and given it away ; that besides the Guinea for Horse hire and a Guinea for the Hackney Coach , he gave the Man that rode with him in the Coach 6 Guineas for bearing him Company from London to Highgate . In all he had squander 'd away above 19 Guineas in less than two Days . William Dulley . My Man drove the Waggon that the Prisoner went in from Barnet to Bigglesworth , the Prisoner had almost killed him ; he had given him 19 Pints of Wine and a Hot-pot . I was with the Prosecutor when he took the Prisoner , about 2 o'Clock on Friday Morning at the Cock at Eaton . The Prisoner gave him some Money , and said , that there was all that was left . The Jury found him guilty . Death . 14. Edmund Cheesborough was indicted for forging a promissary Note for 50 l. dated July 2d , 1731 , and payable 6 Months after Date , to Thomas Olivant or Order , by Richard Brumton ; and an Indorsement on the said Note in the name of Thomas Olivant , and afterwards indorsing his own Name thereon , and publishing the said Note so indorsed , knowing the same to be false and counterfeit , with an intent to deceive and defraud Stephen Prue , and unjustly to charge Thomas Olivant with the Payment of 50 l. to the great Damage of the said Thomas Olivant and Stephen Prue . Stephen Prue , on the 22nd of August last , Matthew Warren ( whom I had some Knowledge of ) came and told me , that a Friend of his who was going to Dun'irk , wanted a parcel of Goods in my Way . I asked him how his Friend propos 'd to pay for'em . Here 's a promissary Note ( says he ) of Mr. Brumton 's , payable to Mr. Olivant at six Months , and Mr. Olivant has indors 'd it ; they are both good Men , they belong 'd to the Exchequer . I told him I would take the Note in Payment , if I could be satisfy 'd that it was good . He said he 'd leave it with me , and I might make Enquiry ; and so he did . I went to the Exchequet , and enquired of one of the Clerks there if he knew Mr. Brunton and Mr. Olivant . He said , Yes . I told him I had a Note of theirs for 50 l. If it was for 500 l says he , your Money would be safe , for they are both very good men . I asked him if I could see either of em ? He said No they were both out of Town . I asked him , if he knew their Hand Writing ? He said , No . And so I return 'd home . Warren came again , and the Prisoner with him . I asked Warren [ aside ] how the Prisoner came to have this Note of Mr. Olivant ? Why , says he , When Mr. Cheesborough was in his Prosperty he lent Mr. Olivant a considerable Sum of Money ; and now in Gratitude . Mr. Olivant has lent him this Note . As Mr. Cheesborough is going to Sea , he 's very much straiten 'd for Time ; and a short Delay now will be a great Hindrance to him : And therefore I must desire you to come to a resolution as soon as possible . Upon this I let the Prisoner have the Goods , and he indors 'd the Note with his own Name . Two Days afterwards , having some Business at Whiteball I called at the Exchequer and met with a Friend of mine , whom I could not find when I was there before . He brought me to a Gentleman there , who ( when I shew 'd him the Note ) told me , that I was impos 'd on , that the Note was neither writ nor indors 'd by either Mr. Brumton or Mr. Olivant , and the Writing was quite different from theirs . And then he shew 'd me their Writing in some Books . Upon this I procur 'd a Warrant from Sir Richard Brocas , and went in search after Warren and the Prisoner . Warren was sled , but I met with the Prisoner at the seven Stars in Rosebary Lane , on the 26th or 27th of November . As I came back with him in a Coach , I said to him . You could not well do this alone , you must have some Accomplices . And , says he , I know I shall be hang 'd , I must own that the Note is counterfeit . Matthew Warren and I , and one more were concern 'd in drawing it up . This is the Note . Court . Let it be read . Clerk of the Arraigns reads . July 2 . 1731 . I promise to pay to Mr. Thomas Olivant or order the Sum of fifty Pounds , six Months after Date , for value receiv 'd . L. 50 - per Richard Brumton . 2 July , 5 Dec. At the Exchequer Indors 'd Thomas Olivant Edm . Cheesborough Mr. Walker . The Prosecutor came to me at the Exchequer and asked if this was Mr. Olivent 's Writing ? I told him no it was neither his Hand nor like it . I do Business for Mr. Olivant , and am well acquainted with his Writing . Several other Gentlemen swore that the Writing was nothing like Mr. Olivant 's . Prisoner . Warren came to me , and desired me to indorse the Note . I refused several times ; but at last I consented ; he said he wanted some Goods of the Prosecutor , who would not take it with his Indorsement . Mr. Pru . said , he would enquire about the Note and after he had made enquiry , he accepted the Note on my Indorsement . But I never had the Goods , for Warren went off with them all , and I lost Money by him besides . Court to the Prosecutor . You say , that Warren apply 'd to you first . Did he apply for Goods on his own Account , or on the Prisoner 's ? Mr. Prue . He said the Goods were for the Prisoner ; I delivered none for Warren 's Use . but all for the Prisoner 's . The Prisoner gave me the Note , and indors 'd it with his own Name , and told me , that he was going Abroad . He indeed desir 'd Warren to look out the Goods ; for he said , that he himself did not understand 'em . As to the Prisoner 's not having the Goods , I have heard indeed that Warren was too cunning for him , and got the Goods from on Board the Ship , with other Goods of the Prisoner 's , to the Value of 7 or 8 l. The Prisoner was to have been try 'd last Sessions , but he broke out of Newgate , and went to Carlisle , from whence he was brought back by a Habeas Corpus . The Jury found him guilty . Death . But the next Morning he was found hanging in his Cell , and so he avoided receiving the Sentence that was on the Monday following pass 'd on the others capitally convicted Criminals . 15. William Woolcott , alias Williwick , and Henry Barns were indicted for assaulting William Pardon on the Highway , in Whitechapel Parish , putting him in Fear , and taken from him 2 Keys , a Hat , a Wig , and 5 s. 10 d. in Money , April 5 . William Pardon . Between 10 and 11 at Night , at the End of Red-Lion-Street , in Goodman 's Fields , I saw 4 suspicious Fellows on the opposite Side of the Way ; they cross 'd towards me . I went into the middle of the Street , and began to run , in hopes to avoid them ; for I had but 4 or 5 Doors farther to go ; but I happen 'd to fall , when immediately one of them got upon me , and the others about me ; they cut me on the Head in several Places . You may see the Scars . I struggled and struck at them with my Hand , and ( when they kept my Hand down ) with my Foot . They took from me my Hat and Wig , 2 Keys , 5 s. and about 6 Pennyworth of Halfpence ; and then leaving me in a very bloody Condition , they vanish 'd , as I thought all at once , and I made shift to get home . The Assault was so sudden and the Abuse so great , that I could not take so much notice of them , as to know them again . I was afterwards sent for by a Justice of Peace , on an Information given by James Tripland . James Tripland . I and James Stratford , and the two Prisoners committed the Robbery . As the Prosecutor began to run , I set my Leg before him , and threw him down , and then I hit him a knock on the Head with a Broomstick , and Barns gave him another ; we held him down , and Wolcott and Stratford rifled him . We sold the Hat and Wig for a Crown to Nell Wilford , who is now in Jail ( for stealing the Goods of James Bromly ) she 's one that buys stolen Goods , and sells 'em in Rag Fair . This 5 s. and 6 s. 5 d. Halfpenny , that we took from the Prosecutor was equally divided among us four . John Matthews , Constable . I took Woolcott at the Dunghill by the Glass-House against Rag Fair . He said he was a dead Man , but was innocent of this Fact . William Atly . On Tripland 's Information , I had a Warrant to take Barns , and found him . He said he had committed several Robberies , but believed he was in no Danger , because the People ( his Comrades ) were in safe Custody , and therefore he fear 'd no body . Barns . I was taken on Chetwin 's Information , and not on Tripland 's ; I never was in Tripland 's Company in my Life . Tripland . Yes . but he has many a Time ; we have often gone together to Shops to steal Money Boxes . and Sugar Loaves , and such kind of trifling Things . Francis Weaker . I was with the Constable when Barns was taken , and carried before Alderman Brocas and Mr. Justice Phillips , he own 'd he had been in several Robberies but said the People were safe in Jail . I asked him if he knew James Stratford ? He said , no ; but by and by he said he was playing at Skettles with Stratford when he was taken . I thought , says I , you said you did not know James Stratford ? O , says he , that was another Man of the same Name . Henry Jackson . I heard Barns say that he had been guilty of some Things , but the People were in Custody ; he would not name Particulars . Barns . I was at Home at my Mother 's when the Robbery was committed . Tripland swore he would hang me if there were no more Men in the World . He was Transported 4 or 5 Years ago by the Name of James Ogden , Woolcott . Tripland said he knew he was a dead Man , but he would hang 50 before he would be hanged himself . He was Transported by his Uncle 's Name , James Ogden , who is an Oyster Meeter . Court . If you could produce the Record of his Transportation , it might be of some Service to you . The Jury found them both Guilty . Death . 16. John Dunstan was indicted for breaking and entering the House of William Simmonds in St. Sepulchres Parish , and stealing a Saw , a pair of Nippers , a pair of Players , a pair of Compasses , a pair of Scissars , a Brush , a black Lead Pencil , a piece of Mother of Pearl , a small Wooden Pully , 12 Sets of inside Ivory Fan Sticks , 12 Sets of outside Ivory Fan Sticks , 3 engraved Copper-Plates , and 2 pair of Shoes , the Goods of several Persons , the 19th of this Instant May , in the Night . William Simmons . I live in Brown's-Court , in the Little-Old-Baily . There is an empty House next to mine : My Garret-Window was broke open about 2 in the Morning , and the Goods taken away . The Garret-Window of the empty House was found open too , and so was the Kitchen Window below . Thereupon we concluded that the Rogue must get in that way , and the Prisoner having been lurking in that empty House 2 or 3 Nights before , we suspected him to be the Thief , and upon search he was taken a selling a pair of Shoes in Field-Lane the same Day , and several of the Goods were found upon him . Michael Wharton . The Prosecutor is a Fanstick Maker , and I mend Shoes , I am his Tenant , and lodge in the Room under the Garret that was broke open . About Two in the Morning I heard a Noise over my Head , and thought my Landlord was got up to work betimes ( for he works in the Garret , and so do I too ) I did not rise till Five , and then going into the Garret , the first thing that I miss 'd was my Knife , and then these Shoes . I calls up my Landlord ; Landlord , says I , I have lost my old Shoes , I am ruined ! He looks about , And so am I too , says he . We presently thought the Fellow that had lain in the empty House was the Thief . And so away goes I to Field-Lane , for you must note , that when these Fellows steal Shoes , they sell them in or about Field-Lane or Rag-Fair , but Boats they carry to Charing-Cross . As good Luck would have it , I soon met with my Chap at one of those Shops , where they Vamp up old Shoes ; he was offering one of these Pairs to Sale , but I suppose he would not offer the other Pair for fear of being suspected , for I had sky 'd the Soles , ready for new soleing . I collar 'd my Gentleman ; he immediately said , if I would go to the Alehouse he would make every thing easy . I told him I would not compound Felony , I was going to search him , but he himself took these 2 pair of Fare-sticks , this pair of Nippers , this Pully , and Knife and Brush out of his own Pockets ; and this Saw and 2 pair of Shoes we found in the empty House . Thomas Barber , Constable . When I was charged with the Prisoner , he said , if we would but have Patience till his Sister came , he would impeach his Accomplices ; but when he came before the Justice , he said , no Body was concern 'd but himself . At another time he said , that he lay in the empty House all Night , and that 2 or 3 Fellows came and robbed the next House , and dropp 'd the Goods in the Yard . Prisoner . Did not you see 3 Men go up the Yard between 2 and 3 o'Clock in the Morning , and ask the Watchman if he had not seen a Calf run in there ? Barber . No . Prisoner . Did not the Watchman tell you that 3 Men came up to look for a Calf ? Barber . I heard some Talk about a Calf , but to the best of my Remembrance I understood it to be only an idle pretence of the Prisoner 's , and that it was he that said it , and not the Watchman . Mr. Shaw . Such a thing might happen , for Calves are driven to Smithfield at all Hours of the Night . Prisoner . I was come from on Board the Dursley-Galley at Deptford , and then went to drink at the Horse-shoe in Fetter-Lane , and afterwards , having no Lodging , I went and laid down in that empty House to sleep . I was waked with a Noise , and looking out the Window , I saw 3 Men in the Yard , and when I call 'd to them they ran away , and dropp 'd the Goods , and I took them up . The Jury found him guilty . Death . 17 , 18. Edward Spaul , alias Spaw ( was a 2d time ) and Michael Shaw , were indicted for breaking and entring the House of Elizabeth Webb , in White-Chappel Parish , and stealing 2 Porridge-pots , 2 Sauce-pans , 1 Srew-pan , a Waistcoat , 3 Aprons , and some old Rags , April 21 . between 11 and 12 at Night . 19 . And Sarah Warfield was indicted for receiving part of the said Goods knowing them to be stolen . Elizabeth Webb . I live in Goodman's-Yard in the Minories , I have a Wash-house joining to my Dwelling-house ; I went to Bed about 10 at Night , and left every thing safe ; but when I got up in the Morning , part of my Wash-house was untiled ; I believe there might be 12 or 14 Tiles taken off ; I lost 2 Porridge-pots , 2 Sauce pans , a Srew-pan , a Waistcoat , 3 Aprons , and a Bundle of Linen Rags , which was put in one of the Pots . The outside Rag ( in which the others were wrapt ) was a Rag I had used about the House so many times , that I knew it to be the same I had lost as soon as I saw it . I found it again ( and it was all that I found ) at the Prisoner Warfield 's House , in a back Lane by Rag-Fair , over-against the Hog-house . James Tripland . I was drinking with Spaul and Shaw , at the Black-Boy in Well-street , till 11 at Night , and from thence we went together into Goodman's-Yard ; there was a Place pailed in , where some Houses were building ; Shaw got over the Pails , and then handed a Ladder over to us , by the Help of which we got over too , and pull 'd the Ladder after us , and raised it up against the Side of the Dwelling-house . Our first Design was to steal Lead , but it stuck so hard , that in pulling it up , some of the Mortar sell thro ' into the Wash-house upon the Brass Porridge pots , which we perceiving , we thought the Pots would be a better Booty than the Lead , and so we untiled Part of the Wash-house , and put the Ladder in , and Spaul went down , and brought the Goods up to us . When we had got what we thought convenient , we haul 'd the Ladder up , and set it again against the Pails : Spaul went over first , and I and Shaw handed the Things to him , and then followed ; we carried them all to Warfield 's House ; her Husband keeps a Smith 's Shop , but I have no Acquaintance with him . We knock 'd at the Fore-Door , and a Man within ( I do n't know who he was ) bid us go to the Back-Door , which we did ; you go down Steps to the Back-Door . Sarah Warfield open 'd it to us ; I and Shaw handed the Things down to Spaul , and he gave them to her . Court . Had you any Light ? Could you see her Face ? Tripland . Yes , there was a Candle on the Steps , and I knew her before . At 7 the same Morning I was taken up at the Black-Boy in Well-street , and sent to Newgate ; and that Afternoon Spaul and Shaw came to me there , and gave me 3 s. 6 d. for my Dividend , and told me , a Groat more would have come to my Share , but they were oblig 'd to spend 1 s. at Warfield 's House when she paid 'em the Money . From Newgate I was remov 'd to Clerkenwell , when I was made an Evidence . A Warrant was afterwards granted to search Warfield 's House , and I went thither with an Officer . Court . Did you find any thing ? Tripland . No . Court . Was the Prosecutrix there then ? Tripland . No , she had been there before . Prosecutrix . I went by myself , and picked out a Rag that was mine from a Heap of other Rags that lay in a Corner of the Room Up-stairs , and every thing look 'd so miserable , that I did not expect to find any thing else there that belong 'd to me . Court . Have you got it here ? Pro . No , they said I should but be laughed at for bringing such a thing hither . Court . They were mistaken , it was very proper to be produced , if you could swear to it . Pro . Yes , that I could safely , I knew it in particular ; for I had dry 'd my House with it many and many a time . John Webb . On the first of May , I saw Shaw run down Blue-Anchor yard , and a Man after him ; and so I ran too , and assisted in taking him . Michael Hodson . At Aldgate I saw Spaul and Lightfoot in a Coach , and hearing they were going before a Justice , I followed . When we were there , Lightfoot told me , that he had made himself an Evidence against 2 Men that frequented the Black-Boy in Well-Street . I ask 'd him the Name and Description of but one of them , for fear I should forget 'em both if he told me of two . I and James Rolfe went thither directly ; when we came to the Door , to prevent Suspicion , I hipp 'd to Rolfe , who , on purpose , walk 'd at a little Distance from me , and told him he ow 'd me a Dram ; we went in , and call 'd for a Quartern , and after that , for another . The Prisoner was then there , and several others , he answer 'd the Description that Lightfoot had given me ; but I was not sure that it was he . By and by one of the Creatures call 'd him Mick ! Mick ! says I , what have I got a Name sake here ? My Name is Mick too , here 's to you Namesake sure we are not Namesake 's in the Surname too ? My Name is Michael Hodson ! No , says one , his Name is Michael Shaw ; then I found I was right . Soon after this he went and sate in one of the Womens Laps , and said , Give me a Kiss , for I am a going , and having kiss 'd her , he went out . I paid my Reckoning , and said , I must go too ; but when I came into the Street , he was got out of Sight . I went in search after him , till I was weary , and was returning home , when accidentally I saw him again , he perceiving I took Notice of him , ran down Blue-Anchor-Yard , and I after him ; but he was so faint with running , that he drop 'd down by the White-Swan Alehouse , and there I took him , and then Webb came up to me . Shaw . I never saw Tripland but two or three times . I was taken on Lightfoot 's Information , but when Tripland heard of it , he charged me with this Robbery . Spaul . I was taken with Lightfoot , and as soon as Tripland knew it , he swore he would hang me if I had a thousand Lives . Shaw . Fleming told me that he himself was concern 'd in this Burglary along with Tripland . Fleming . No , I said I saw Tripland in the Evening , but where he went afterwards I can not tell , for I was in Prison then . Justice Philips . Shaw , as he says , was not taken up for this Burglary , but on Lightfoot 's Information , for breaking a House in Petticoat-Lane . Michael Hodson . I have known Sarah Warfield these 14 or 15 Years , she bore an honest Character , and I never heard that she was suspected of buying stolen Goods , nor do I think she would be guilty of such a Thing Fleming . I have heard Tripland say , that the Goods were sold in Petticoat-Lane . Court . Tripland do n't say now that they were sold to Sarah Warfield , but that she receiv 'd them . He tells you , that he was taken up by 7 o'Clock the same Morning , and that in the Afternoon , Shaw and Spaul brought him 3 s. 6 d. for his Share . Justice Philips . Tripland told me , when I granted a Search Warrant , that he hardly expected to find any of the Goods at Warfield 's , for it was her Custom to carry 'em out of the House , and sell them as soon as she receiv 'd them . Fleming . Tripland told me , that when they carry 'd the Goods to Sarah Warfield 's House , he did not see her , but only her Husband . Tripland . Where did I tell you so ? Fleming . At Bridewell . Tripland . I never said any such Thing . The Jury found Spaul and Shaw Guilty . Death . And acquitted Warfield . 20. Joshua Floyd , was indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for feloniously slaying , in the Parish of St. Paul 's Convent-Garden , John Urly , aged 9 Years , by driving 2 Horses , Harness 'd to a loaded Dray , whereby the said John receiv 'd one mortal Bruise in the Head , of which he instantly dy 'd , the 28th of April last .

Owen Plumstead . I was robb 'd in Hare-Street in Brick-Lane ; but I do n't know by whom , for I was got drunk . David Wood . I was lock 'd out o'Saturday Night , I met the Prisoners in Hare-Street . They ask 'd me to take a Walk , and when I had gone a little Way , Harry Defoe pull 'd out a pair of Shoes , and said , Will you buy these Davy ? No , says I , and then he pull 'd off his own old Shoes , and threw them away , and put the other Shoes on ; soon after , we met 3 young Fellows , whom we knew , they talk 'd with us a little , and bid us good Night , and the Prisoners and I turn 'd up Hare-Street again ; says Daniel Defoe , Here 's a Man asleep , let 's see if he has got any Money . And then D'angre put his Hand in the Man 's Pocket and took out 3 d. I saw no more , and this was between 1 and 2 in the Morning ; I speak nothing but the Truth before God Almighty . Then we went to drink a Dram , and I left 'em in George-Street . Philip Morean , Hugh Mason , and James Mae . As we were going along Hare-Street between 1 and 2 in the Morning , Daniel Defoe pass 'd us , look 'd us in the Face , and went forward ; he knew us all , a little way farther , a Man was lying drunk in the Street . Daniel stopp 'd when he came to this Man , and cry 'd , Hey ! God darm ye ! what do you I where for ? He had hardly spoke , when 2 Men on the other side of the Way , cry 'd , Hip ! and he went over to 'em . We went to the drunken Man to see if we knew him , but we did not . He then had on his Hat and Wig , and his Shoes too . to the best of our Remembrance , but we will not be positive . We went a-cross the Way to see who they were that hip 'd to Daniel , we knew them all four ; they were the 3 Prisoners , and David Wood . They began to pick a Quarrel with us , upon which we left 'em , but suspecting that they had , some design upon the drunken Man , we stood at a little Distance and watch 'd 'em , we saw 'em all go to him , and rifle him , and then go off . When they were gone , we went and raised him up , and waked him ; his Hat , and Wig , and Shoes were taken away , and no Body had been near him but the Prisoners , and Wood , from the time we left him , till we came to him again . We ask 'd him if he knew who had robb 'd him ? and he said , No .

And what is to pay now , Sir ? says I ; Not a Farthing , Sir , says he , for I taud ye I wad give ye a Dram . Then it shanna go bare-ars 'd , Sir , says I , Let us have a Quartern of something that you like best ; I think , Sir , says he , that a Dram of Anniseed is as bealing as any thing ; then let it be Anniseed , sir , says I . And so I went into a lattle back Place where the Soldiers leave the Arms , and Hannah Wallis , the Prasoner at the Bare , came and sat on the Table by me . Now , Sir , says she , Wanno ye give me a Drom ? No , says I , I have just now tacken one . Well , Sir , says she , if you canno drink your sell , I can . And then Taylor came with the Anuiseed , he fill 'd a Glass and drank to me , and sat the rest upon the Table , and went away again to some Customers in the Shop . Then I tuck out my Box to tack a pickle of snuff , and put it intull my Pocket again , and she see where it was ; and while I reach 'd over the Table to fell a Glass , she packt it out of my Pocket . Court . Did you see her take it ? Johnston . No , my Loard , I donna see her tack it , but she want awa prasently , and I mist it the Minute she was gone . And I caw 'd out to Taylor , and he run after her , but when he came back , she said , I cou no catch her , but I know her well enuh , and that Soldier Stephen Guy ( the other Prasoner ) belongs to her , he goes for her Husband . Then says Guy to me , If you 'll give me a Shilling , I 'll get it you again to Morrow . That I will , Sir , says I , and I will leave the Money with Mr. Taylor , for I wou no lose the Box , because it is none of my own , and I will give you a Dram now ; so I call 'd for a Dram , and then says Guy , if you will go with me now , I will carry ye to her , for I ken where she is . As I was going out , Mr. Taylor said , Hauve a care of your Sword , Mr. Joanston . Donna you fear that , Sir , says I , my Sword is sause anab , and the Deel shanna get it from me . Guy carried me to a lattle place where she was , and there was an aud Woman a-Bed in the same Room ; Guy can 'd for a Dram , what thinks I , do they fall Drams here ? Then I demanded my Box of Hannah Wallis , but Guy desired me to lat it alone till to Morrow , and the aud Woman a-Bed had us not mack a Noise . I tuck her for an aud Woman , but I kenna whether she was a Woman or no , for I did no search her . While I was talking with Guy , Wallis got out of Door , but I prasantly tuck haud of her , and caud oot for the Watch , but no Body came . I carried her along the Street , and Guy follow 'd us . I anks 'd him what he wanted , and he sad , Sir , I donna want her from ye . Then we came to a wide place , I think ye can it Broken Cross . Aboot 3 a Clock in the Mourning , and there Guy run up against me , laid hand of my Sword , and tore it awa , so that he brock the Belt , and then he tuck to his Heels . The Woman wad a gone awa too , but I wad ne lat her ; says I , You will gang along with me , or I will trail ye by the Leg , and he daum 'd to ye . And so I got her back again to Mr. Taylor 's Shop , and caud him out of Bed . What is the Matter with you now , Sir ? says Mr. Taylor Eloard , Sir , I have been roab 'd of my Sword , says I ; and wha has taken it from ye , sir , says he ; why , that Fallow , Sir , says I , that pratanded to get my Box for me , kenye what his Name is ? O give me a Pan and Ink , and I 'll sat ye doon his Name , and what he may find him . So she tuck a Pan and Ink , and sat down a Name . Why , says Taylor , that 's the wrong Name , his Name is Stephen Guy , and he belongs to Major Guy 's Regiment , he 'll mount Kensington Guard to Morrow . But hand your Peace , Maister Joanston , donna ye speak a Word of this Maiter , for an ye do , he 'll gang awa , and the Deel canno catch him ; he has been in Newgate already , and he wonna like to come here again ; but an ye mack no Noise it is tan to one an ye donna see him come strauling this way by and bye . Then I auks 'd this Hannah Wallis for my Box , and she taud me an I wad give her a Shilling I wad have it again . Let me see it then , said I ; No , says she , I will have the Money first . So I ding 'd the Money doon upon the Goonter , and then she put her Hond intull her Bosom , and tuck out the Box . About 4 a Clock Stephen Guy came by the Door , and Taylor punch 'd me , and said , There 's your Man ! And upon that Guy tuck to his Heels , but I run after him , and tuck him hand by the Collar , and punch 'd him in the Gullet , and so brote him back intull Taylor 's Shop ; while he was there he went a whisper 'd with Hannah Wallis , and by and by he pack 'd a Quarrel with another Soldier , and in the mean time the Woman got off ; but she was afterwards tacken up again , and the same Day she pawn 'd the Sword to Ann Skelton . Ann Skelton . The Prisoner , Hannah Guy , pawned this S word to me . The Prosecutor 's Evidence , as far as it related to what past in Taylor 's Shop , was confirmed by Taylor himself . Stephen Guy . While I was drinking a Quartern of Gin at Taylor 's Shop , Hannah Wallis came in ; her Name is Wallis , and not Guy , for she 's none of my Wife ; the Prosecutor came in soon after , and took her by the Hand , and went into the back Room . When she went out of Door , and the Prosecutor said he had lost his Box , Mr. Taylor asked me if I knew her ? I said , Yes ; and that if the Prosecutor would go with me , I believ 'd I could find her , and so I did . He took her as far as Broken-Cross , and I following them , he bid me go back , and back I went , without meddling with him . Hannah Wallis . The Prosecutor brought me to a wide Place , Angel-Court , at the End of Thieving-Lane ; Come , says he , let me have my Bargain here , since you would not let me have it in Taylor 's House ; and then he laid his Sword down by me in the dark , and staid with me half a Quarter of an Hour ; and then I took the Sword , and putting it under the Steps of the Court , I went back with him to Taylor 's Shop , and that was the first time that ever I spoke with him in Taylor 's Shop , and he told me then , that he should have 140 l. for hanging Stephen Guy , and then he would put a new Suit of Cloaths on my Back . Guy is none of my Husband , though I have a Husband , but Taylor has seduced me from him , and been the Ruin of me : He keeps a notorious Bandy-house .

And 88. James Gibson was indicted for receiving the same , knowing them to be stolen . Mr. Curll sworn . Court . What is your Name ? Curll . Edmund Curll . A Juryman . Curr did you say , or Cull ? Curll . No , Curll , C , U. R double L. Court . What have you to say against the Prisoners ? Curll . My Lord , for about a Month past , I have been obliged to attend on some of my best Customers at the other End of the Town , and in that Time I lost a great many Books . I may say , with a good Conscience , to the Number of 60 Volumes . I could not imagine which way they went , till going thro ' Russel Court , I saw 17 Volumes of 'em lying all a-Row upon Gibson 's Stall . Seeing more but his Wife in the Shop , I ask 'd her where her Husband was ? and she called him down . I told him those were my Books , and asked him who he bought them of ? He told me , Of a Girl , who said she brought 'em from a Relation of hers in York-street . That he had bought 3 Parcels of her , for which he had given her 10 s. beside 2 s. 6 d. which he lent her on the last Parcel . Well , says I , do n't expose yourself , but come to my House and drink a Dish of Tea with me to morrow , and I will shew you the respective Glass-Cases from whence these Books were taken . So I took away the 17 Volumes . Court . Had you a Constable with a Warrant ? Curll . No , my Lord , In the Warmth of my Loss , I took them without a Warrant , for which indeed Mr. Justice Du Veil blamed me . Court . And with good Reason , you ought not have done so ; it was very wrong . Curll . It was more than I knew , my Lord ; but if I have committed any Error , I hope your Lordship will excuse it . Mr. Gibson delivered the Books to me very readily , and he came to drink Tea with me next Day , and I shew 'd him the respective Places where the Books were taken from . Then I call 'd down my Girl ( the other Prisoner ) she 's about 15 Years old . And Mr. Gibson said , it was she : that brought him the Books . I tax 'd her with it , and she own 'd that she had sold several Parcels to him , for which she had receiv 'd 12 s. 6 d. I justly had more Resentment against the Buyer than the Child , and tho ' I have been obliged to do Justice in this Court , God , forbid that I should be guilty of the Blood of any one ! I have done nothing hither to without the best Advice , and will do nothing but what is just and honourable . I would take the Directions of this Court in any Case ; and as Justice and Mercy always go together , here I hope to have them both . The Girl had lived with me about 3 Months , and I am sure I had the greatest Tenderness imaginable for her ; I doved her next to my own Flesh . I can prove nothing of my self , I know nothing but by her own Confession ; and God for bid that I should charge her with any thing farther than I know . Court . What did you do after she had confest this ? Curll . I did not do any thing with her that Day ; I cou 'd do nothing , but it gave me much Pain . I have told the naked Fact with the strictest Justice in the World . God forbid I should do otherwise ! Court . What Books did you lose ? Curll . Let me see . I have them all in Court , but they are sealed up in a Bag . Here , Cholmly the Constable , bring the Bag forward , break open the Seal . Pish ! Here , here ; you take it the wrong way . Ay , now you are right ; give me the Books . Three , 7 and 5 is 12 - 16 - one more , that 's right . Here 's 17 Volumes . Here 's the 4th Volume of the Antiquities of Surry in Octavo , large Paper . There are 5 Volumes in the Set , which I value at 5 Guineas , 2 Volumes ditto , small Paper ; the whole Set is 5 Volumes , Value 3 Guineas , 2 Volumes of the Antiquities of Westminster , one Volume of the Antiquities of Rochester . These 3 Antiquities in my Hand are the Breach of 3 Sets , all span new , 11 Guineas as good as any in my Pocket . Then here 's L'Estrange 's AEsop compleat , Denham 's Poems , the devout Christian Companion , and the Lord knows how many more . O ! here 's a particular Volume that I lost out of my own private Closet up 2 pair of Stairs backwards ; 't is a Collection of Pieces relating to Dr. Sacheverell , The Mouse Trap , Van 's House , Meditations on a Broomstick , and several other Things bound up together , Cholmly , Constable . After Mr. Curll had taken the 17 Volumes at Mr. Gibson 's House , I went with a Warrant to search for more , and found 3 other Books , which Mr. Curll pick 'd out and own 'd . I really believe that Mr. Gibson bought them in Ignorance , for he told me readily that he had bought several of the Girl ; as for the rest of the Books that have been produc 'd , I had them at Mr. Curll 's Shop , and can not say whether they were ever in Mr. Gibson 's Possession . Court . Have you that Warrant in your Pocket ? Constable . I believe not . No , I can not find it . The Defence of the Prisoners . Sarah Beeston . I never stole the Books . There were other People in the House besides me . A considerable Number of Witnesses , who had known her from her Infancy , or who had entrusted her in their Families , gave her an extraordinary good Character . James Gibson . The Books that Curll found in my Shop , were bought of this Girl . My Wife bought the first Parcel when I was not at home . The second Time she brought 4 Books for which she asked a Crown , and I gave her 4 s. I asked her who sent her ; she said an own Cousin of hers , with whom she lived , at the End of York-Street . I thought that she look 'd like an honest Girl , and so I bought them with the less Scruple . I have no great Judgment in Books my self ; I am a Carpenter by Trade , the Book-selling is my Wife 's Business . The Girl came again when I was from home , and sold some more to my Wife . The last Time she came , I told her , I would buy no more of those Books , till she brought the Gentleman whom she said she came from . She told me very readily , that he was not at home then , but she would bring him as soon as he came in . I was in haste to go out , and expecting to see her again , I threw down half a Crown in part for the Books she had then brought . I exposed the Books at my Door , and there Curll found them . I described the Girl to him ; he said she was his Servant ; that he believed I was an honest Man , and if I 'd come to breakfast with him in the Morning , he 'd put me to Rights ; and so he took away 17 Volumes . My Neighbours advised me not to go alone to Curll , but by all means to take Witnesses with me , for fear he should draw me into a Snare . When I went I knew his Girl at first Sight . He would have had me to have prosecuted her . I told him I knew not how to do it , and as he had taken the Books from me , and had had them in his own Possession a Day and a Night , I could not pretend to swear to them . He was in a violent Passion ; he went up Stairs and brought down a Shagreen Box . Here Gentlemen , says he ( for several were in Company , and he did not direct his Discourse to any one in particular ) this Box has been broke open , and 10 Guineas and a broad Piece taken out of it . Now , what would you have a Man do in such a Case ; 't is hard if I must lose all ; I expect some Satisfaction : Take your choice ; if you 'll give me Satisfaction for my Money , I 'll fit down with the Loss of my Books ; If you 'll make my Books good , I 'll take up with the Loss of my Money . As he did not ever pretend that I had any thing to do with his Money Box , I wondred what he meant by making such a Proposal : And as I knew my own Innocence , I was resolved to take my Trial . Thomas Corbett , Bookseller . I have known Gibson several Years , he 's a Carpenter by Trade , and knows little of Books ; but it was his Wife that chiefly managed the Bookseller 's Business , she being a Bookseller 's Daughter . He has the Character of a very honest Man . Several of the Books he bought of the Girl were odd Volumes , and therefore of very small Value . But if the Sets had been compleat which Curll values at three Guineas a Set , I do n't believe any Bookseller would have given half the Money for them . Curll . If you do n't know how to make so much of them , I do . William Threadkill . I have known Gibson seven Years , and he bears a very good Character . I saw Curll take the Books from his Stall , and he assisted Curll in looking them out ; says Curll , I believe you are a very honest Man , and 't was my Girl that brought you these Books ; but her Friends are very able Persons , and if you 'll come to my House , we 'll set this Matter to rights . Curll . I could not say that her Friends were very able , because I know otherwise ; but I said they were very honest . Threadkill . When we were at Curll 's House , he brought a Box , and told us he had lost ( I do n't know whether it was 7 or 10 Guineas and a Broad Piece ) out of it , and that 't would be very hard if he must lose all , and that if he could have his Money again , he would bear the Loss of his Books ; or if he was satisfied for his Books , he would put up with the Loss of his Money . The Constable came in and said , Who Charges this Girl ? And says Curll , I ca n't well do it , but Gibson may . Says Gibson , you have had the Books a Day and a Night in your Custody , and I ca n't swear now that they are the same as you took from my Shop . There is a Book about Dr. Sacheverell , which I have lent to my Ledger , I do n't know but it was bought of the Girl with the others . Says Curll , I have lost no such Book . Curll . The Book he named was Dr. Sacheverell 's Trial ; not the Collection of Pamphlets relating to the Doctor . Several other Witnesses appeared to his Reputation , and gave him the Character of an honest industrious Man . The Jury found Sarah Beeton guilty to the Value of 10 d. and acquitted James Gibson . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 89. John Waller was indicted for endeavouring to defraud John Edlin of his good Name , his Life , his Goods , and Chattels , by making before Mr. Justice Gifford , on the 28th of January last , a false Information in Writing , by the Name of John Trevor , charging the said Edlin and another Person with assaulting him the said Waller on the Highway , near Colney in Hertfordshire , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 4 Portugal Pieces , 5 Ducats , 2 Guineas , and a Piece of Mechlin Lace , October 18 . 1731 . Robert Hinton , Constable . The Prisoner by the Name of Trever , charged me with John Edlin . I took Edlin before Capt . Gifford , and the Prisoner there made his Information , which when drawn up in Writing , was read over to him , and he sign 'd it ( with a Mark ) and entred into Recognizance to prosecute . Justice Gifford . The Prisoner , by the Name of Trevor , charged John Edlin , and another , who was then in Newgate , with robbing him on the Highway between Coney and St. Albans . I thought that Edlin had an honester Look than the Prisoner , and that I had seen the Prisoner before , but I could not recollect who he was . I sent to enquire after the Prisoner 's Character , and was told that he was an honest Man , and then I committed Edlin to Newgate . After this the Prisoner came to me again , and told me , that I had made a Mistake in committing Edlin on the Information of Trevor , it should have been on the Information of Waller , says he , for my Name is Waller , and therefore must beg you to alter it . O , is it you Mr. Waller ? says I ; I thought I had seen your Face before . Had I known your Name when you made this Information , I had turned you out of Doors , as I did Five Years ago , when you swore against two Street Robbers ; but since it is so , I shall take a Note of it . And then I made a Memorandum on the side of the Information , That at the time this Information was taken , the Informant said his Name was Trevor ( not Waller . ) The Information was afterwards sent down to the Assizes at Hertford , where Edlin was to be try 'd . The Information of John Trevor , taken on Oath before Richard Gifford , Esq ; one of His Majesty 's Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex . Jan. 28 . 1731 . He faith , That on Thursday , October 28. as he was coming to London with Henry Smith , from Leddon Boswell 's , he was assaulted on the King 's Highway , near Colney in Hertfordshire , about Five in the Evening , by three Men on Foot .

That they took him into a Gravel Pit near the Road , that John Edlin holding up a Stick , said , G - d Damn you , I want to borrow some Money ; and then they knock 'd him down , and took from him four Portugal Pieces , five Ducats , two Guineas , and a Piece of Mechlin Lace , value 5 l. James Robinson . I was before Capt . Gifford , when the Prisoner gave his Information by the Name of Trevor . The Justice was cautions of sending Edlin to Newgate , 'till enquiry was made of the Prisoner 's Character . Upon this the Prisoner took me , and one of Edlin 's Friends with him , to the Crown in Aldersgate-street ; says I , to the Man of the House , Do you know this Man ? pointing to the Prisoner , but not naming him , I know no harm of him , says the Man , but I have liv 'd here but 10 Weeks . From thence the Prisoner took us to a Man in a little Court in the Old-Baily . I ask 'd him the same Question , and he told me , He had known the Prisoner these 12 Years , and knew no harm of him . We return 'd to the Justice 's , I witness 'd the Information , and saw the Prisoner set his Mark to it . I took a Memorandum of the Name in the Information , and the Day of the Month , and went to Hertford Affizes . The Prisoner preferr 'd the Bill before the Grand Jury there , by the Name of Waller . I told 'em the Case , and they sent for the Information out of Court to examine it . Mr. Scrivener . I being Clerk and Cryer on the Home Circuit , it was my Post to swear the Witnesses that go before the Grand Jury . This Bill was brought to me by the Prisoner , and Henry Smith and James Robinson , the other Witnesses , whose Names are Indors 'd on it , came with him . I swore him by the Name of John Waller , according to the Indorsement ; the Bill was found , Billa Vera . Edlin and Davis were brought to their Trial . The Prisoner and his 2 Witnesses were call 'd , I believe , 40 times , but none of 'em appear 'd . Edlin and Davis were acquitted , and the Recognizance of the Prisoner and his Witnesses were Estreated . Prisoner . Mr. Robinson said to me , The Court will not break up to Night , and we may as well go to Bed . Mr. Robinson . No , it was the Prisoner that said so to me . Mr. Scrivener . They were call 'd till after a 11 at Night . The Court fate till 3 or 4 in the Morning to finish , that so they might be time enough at the next Assizes , on that Circuit . Court . Who proves this Bill ? Nathaniel Nott . I am Clerk to Mr. Mitchel , Clerk of the Assizes at Hertford . This is the File of the Indictments of the last Circuit at Hertford , and this is the Bill against Uriab Davis and John Edlin , for robbing the Prisoner . Court . Who indors 'd the Names ? Mr. Nott . The Clerk of the Indictment . Court . Was the Indictment read to them in English , before they were sworn to give Evidence ? Mr. Nott . Yes . [ Then the Bill was read in Court . ] Court . Set up John Edlin . Was you near Coney-Hatch in Hertsordshire , on the 28th of October last , about 5 in the Evening ? Edlin . No ; I was in Albermarle-Mense , at the Bottom of Dover-street , as you go to May-Fair . I live with a Horse Courser there . Court . And you was not in Company with any Person , who took Money or Lace from the Prisoner at that time ? Edlin . No . Court . And you never was guilty of any such Crime ? Edlin . No . Prisoner .

Where was Edlin on the 28th of Oct. at 5 in the Evening ? Cullimore . In the Yard , at Albermarle-Mense . I was out of Business at the same Time , and lay with him at Night . Court . By what particular Token do you remember the Time . Cullimore . It was the Day before my Lord-Mayor 's Day ; and we supp 'd together at Hdy-Hill , the Bottom of Dover-street ; Edlin had a good Character . Tho Sellers . I was with Edlin in Swan-Yard , at the end of Dover-street , on the 28th of Oct. Five a Clock in the Evening is the Time we do our Horses . Daniel Bolton . I am Under-Clerk of the Assizes on the Norfolk Circuit . The Prisoner having ill Success at Hertford , came to Cambridge , on the Tuesday following , and gave me an Information against 2 Men for robbing him , and they were both capitally Convicted . The Country was not satisfy 'd , and there were Suspicious that the Prisoner was a Rogue . Baron Cummins order 'd me to enquire into his Character . I enquir 'd of a Gentleman at Thetford ; Waller , says he , Why , he 's the vilest Fellow living ; He makes a Trade of swearing away Mens Lives for the Sake of the Reward , granted for convicting Robbers . This Gentleman gave me Direction to write to a Gentleman , for a Description and Character of the Prisoner . I wrote , and receiv 'd an Answer at Bury . The Answer describ 'd him exactly , and by good Fortune it came just time enough to prevent the Execution of the 2 Men . The Prisoner pretended in his Evidence against these 2 Men , That he call 'd at the George at New-Market , and that one of them came and begg 'd of him ; that he gave him 6d . then , and afterwards treated him in the Road , they both travelling the same Way ; but at Botsom's-Hill , this Man was so ungrateful as to assault him , and the other Man coming up at the same time , they robb 'd him of 3 Jacobus 's , 9 Guineas , and a Peice of Mecklin-Lace , for he pretended to be a Holland Trader , and then they strip 'd him , and bound him , and there be lay till he was reliev 'd by a Passenger . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Fine . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour .
