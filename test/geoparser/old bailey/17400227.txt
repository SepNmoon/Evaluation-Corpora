Lucy Hewes of St Dunstan 's in the West was indicted for stealing 3 Half-Guineas the Property of John Hughes , Jan. 26 . John Hughes . On the 26th of January in the Evening I was abroad , but I had left 3 Half-Guineas , and 20 Shillings in the Drawer in the Shop , for Change , if it should be wanted : and I put the Gold into a little Screw-box . William Halton . I was in the shop that Evening , and when it was almost dark , I went into a Back-room to light a Candle . When I returned , a Gentleman came in , and asked for a Sheet of what we call Double-Penny . I went behind the Counter to serve him , and saw the Prisoner lying down by the side of it , next the Door , with the Till under her Arm . Upon this I called out to my Fellow-Apprentice , and the Prisoner attempted to run away , but he stopped her . Henry Goodenough . On Saturday Evening , the 26th of January . I was sitting by the Fire in a Back-Office belonging to Mr Hughes , where we usually fit to write ; and Halton ( who was then in the Shop ) calling to me , I ran out , and saw the Prisoner crawling towards the Door . Halton had taken the Drawer from her , before I came into the Shop , and she told me a Gentleman had given it to her , to hold for him . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 149,150. Elizabeth Whitney alias Dribray , and Mary Nash alias Goulding , were indicted for assaulting George Stacey , in the Dwelling-House of William Needham , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him , a Moidore , a Thirty-six Shilling-piece , and 30 Guineas . Nov. 20 . Mr Stacey . On the 20th of November I was going towards Temple-Bar , and the Prisoners followed me , and asked me to give them a Quartern of Brandy , or Gin . I did not value such a little Matter , so I followed them into Needham 's House , at the Rose by Temple-Bar , and there we had 3 Quarterns of Gin . Then they came round me , and began to be sweet upon me , but I said , - stand off , I want nothing with you , nor will I be concerned with you , on any Account . Whitney said , 't is very hard with us , Sir , and I hope you 'll give us something . And a small Matter I did give them ; - I believe it was 2 Six-pences , and I paid for what we had had in the House , and was going away . But getting off my Chair , both of them took hold of me by Force of Arms , and held me so , that I could not help myself . I was a little in Liquor , but not much . I knew very well what I did , and I stood upon my Feet for some Time before they got me down ; but at last they did get me down , and I cried Murder ! Help , for God 's Sake ! Whitney told me , if I cried out , she would cut my Throat . They gagged me ; and my Mouth was so full of Blood , that I could not speak ; and Blood likewise gushed out of my Nose . Then they took from me all my Money ; 30 Guineas , and upwards , a Moidore , and a Thirty-six Shilling-Piece . Upon my crying out , Assistance came , and the Door was got open ; and then the Landlady of the House and the Drawer came in , and saw me in this Condition . They were both bound over by Colonel De Veil to appear here , but they are hired I believe to keep out of the Way . I take them to be Parties concerned . When the Prisoners were taken , we found 25 Guineas in Nash 's Bosom , and one in her Hair ; and they both cried , and said they had no more , but I lost a great deal more . The Moidore , the Thirty-six Shilling-Piece , and all the rest of the Money was gone . After this , there was a Man in the House pretended to be my Assistant , and to right me ; and he said , - You brazen faced Sluts , I 'll see you tied up ; so we went to see for a Constable , but there was none to be got , and the Man of the House rescu 'd the Prisoners away , since which , he is not to be found . The Prisoners were taken some Time afterwards before Colonel De Veil , upon another Account , and he knowing them , I was sent for , and bound over to prosecute them . I never saw the Prisoners , ( to my Knowledge ) before I took them to Needham 's House that Night , - 't was about 7 or 8 o'Clock . I had nothing to do with them , - I did no Harm with them , only gave them a little Gin ; and 't is no Crime to do that . Whitney . Was any Thing found upon me ? Mr Stacey . No , I believe not ; but she was a Party concerned : her Hand was in my Pocket , as well as Nash 's . They both attacked me ; one of them throtled me , and the other robbed me . Whitney . Was not you in Needham 's House before I came in ? Mr Stacey . No ; I was not , I followed you in . Sarah Scot . I have a Sister , ( one Murphin ) who keeps a Stall at Temple-Bar , and she sent for me that Night , to come and open Oysters for her . As I was going thither , I met her Husband going into the Ship Tavern with Oysters . He told me his Wife was at the Rose Alehouse , eating Salt-Fish and Potatoes . I went thither , and as I was cutting a Potatoe , I heard a Man cry , - Lord help me , I am going to be murdered . Speedily he cried out again , - Murder ! Murder ! Lord help me ! Lord , says I , do n't you hear somebody cry out Murder ! Phoo , Phoo , says one , 't is nothing at all . But I took the Candle , and run into one Room , but there was no body there . Then I went to another Room , ( a back Room ) and found there was a Chair , or something , set against the Door , but I push 'd it open , and saw Mr Stacey upon the Ground , the Blood running out of his Nose ; and Whitney had her Right-Hand in his Left Pocket , dragging out his Money , and Nash held him down with her Right-Hand on his Throat . I told them they would certainly kill the Man , and ran directly to Mr Bird the Fishmonger , and informed him , that a Man was likely to be kill 'd at the Rose . He bid me get a Constable , and accordingly I gave Two-pence to two Boys to get one , but there was none to be found . When I got back again to the Rose , I met Nash coming out of the Door , and opposing her passing by me , she flew upon me , but I struck her down to the Ground with my Hand ; then she got up , and made at me again , and Whitney coming up , I defended myself , till Mr Stacey came to my Assistance , and struck at them , and so we took them . From Nash there were 25 Guineas and a half taken ; and tho ' they were stripped naked to their shifts , we could find no more . Nash call 'd for all the Vengeance of God to seize her , if she had any more , but I unpinn 'd her Cap , and found another Guinea in her Hair . The Gentleman said , He still miss 'd 6 or 7 Guineas , and upon my asking what they had done with them , Whitney said , - You Bitch , I will swear a Robbery against you , for my Hood and Cloak , which she herself had hid by the Fire-side . Nash would have made herself an Evidence that Night , and declared that Whitney gave her all the Money . Whitney . Are you sure you saw my Hand in his Pocket ? Scot . Yes . I saw her Right-Hand in his Left Pocket , and was afraid to assist the Gentleman , tho ' I saw her pulling out his Money . Nash . Did she see me pull any Money from the Gentleman ? Scot . No . Whitney took his Money , while Nash held him down by the Throat , till he was perfectly spent . Afterwards I saw Nash pull the Money out of her Bosom , and lay it down on the Table . I never saw the Prosecutor before that Night in my Life . Whitney . I was going that Night to see the Entertainment , at the Old House , and thinking it too soon . I went to the Rose-Alehouse at Temple-Bar , and sent for Mrs wood in Sheer-Lane , to go with me . When I went into the House , the Gentleman was there , and asked me to drink with him . I refus 'd at first , but after some little Perswasion , I drank with him ; and then he wanted to be rude with me , and he pull 'd me about , and tore Hales 's Cloak almost off her Back , so I did not care to stay with him , he hall 'd us about so . About a Fortnight ago , I was set upon by a Man and three Women , and went to Colonel De Veil for a Warrant against them , and then this Gentleman and the Woman ( Scot ) was sent for to prosecute me . Nash . When we went into the House the Gentleman offered to treat us , and called for a Glass of Wine , and said , If we would drink with him , he would give us what we should require . Mr. Stacey . We went into the House all together ; I was not there before them , nor had we a Drop of Wine , for they did not sell Wine ; - 't is an Alehouse . Elizabeth Gale . I wind Silk for my Living ; I have known Nash ever since she was a little Girl : she is a Gloveress , and , as far as I know , work 'd hard for her Maintenance . I never knew any Harm of her in my Life . Another Witness had known Nash about five Years , and gave much the same Account . Whitney 's Father . Whitney is my unfortunate Daughter , to my Sorrow . She was marry 'd , I believe , to one Whitney , a Wheeler by Trade , who is now living , as far as I know . I have seen my Daughter now and then of late Years , but she hath not been very conversant with me . She told me she employed herself in Mantua-making , and she has work 'd for my Wife . I had no Suspicion of her following ill Courses , till I heard she was in the Gatehouse . I know a little of Nash ; her Husband sold Pictures , but he is now gone to Sea . I knew nothing but what she was just and honest . The Jury found both the Prisoners Guilty , Death . [ Death -respited for pregnancy . See summary . ] + 151. Samuel Hill , of St Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of Magdalen Fleetwood , about three in the Night , and stealing 3 Copper Potlids , value 3 s. a Copper Coffee-pot , value 2 s. a Copper Chocolate-pot , value 2 s. a Pewter Cullender , value 4 s. 5 Pewter Plates , value 2 s. 6 d. a Box-Iron and a Heater , value 3 s. February 3 . Magdalen Fleetwood . My Kitchen-Window was broke open , and I lost the Goods mentioned in the Indictment . The Prisoner now will not deny the Fact . I was call 'd out of my Bed , about 7 o'Clock the next Morning , by a young Man who lodges in my House ; but I rais 'd my Servant first , who told me the House had been robb 'd and when I got up , I found a Pane of Glass had been taken out of the Casement , by which Means it had been opened , and I found it open . There are no iron Bars in the Window-frame , and when the Pane of Glass was taken out , any one might put their Hand in and unhasp the Casement . When I went to Bed over Night , at 11 o'Clock , I am sure the Casement was shut , and the Shutter , which slides up and down before the Window on the Outside , was up ; but I had lost the iron Pin which fasten 'd the Shutter at the Bottom , so we used to push it up , and let it rest on a Skewer in the Pin-hole , thinking no one would find the Way into my Kitchen . This Shutter I found down in the Morning , and the Casement open , and a pane of Glass out . It must have been done between my going to Bed at 11 o'Clock , and my rising next Morning at 7 ; but it was broad Day-light when I got up . I was fretted at the Loss of my Goods ; but as I sat at Breakfast , the Watchman , and one Miller , ( who belongs to New Prison ) came to me , and ask 'd me if I had not lost such and such Things ? I told them I had ; and they bid me come along with them . Accordingly I went with them to the Constable 's House , in Brooks-Market , where I found the Prisoner , and all my Goods , after I had told the Constable the Marks of them ; and then we all went before a Justice in Kirby-Street , with the Prisoner and the Goods , where he owned every Thing , and said he had taken the Goods out of my House . ' I ask 'd him how he could serve me so ? and he said he believ 'd he was be witch 'd . Rich Robins . I am a Watchman , and on the 4th of this Month , which was Monday , I was at my Stand , ( between 4 and 5 in the Morning ) above Holborn-Bars , over against Warwick Court ; and the Moon shining I saw the Prisoner coming , along with a Bundle upon his Back . Before he came near me , he went cross the Way , in order to Shun me ; but I cross 'd at the Six Cann's-door , and caught hold of him , and ask 'd him what he had got there ? Ho said , he had only got two or three Plates , and a Pewter Dish . But I found the Bundle very heavy , and hearing the Copper and Pewter rattle , I told him there were more than two or three Plates and a Dish , and I ask 'd him from whence he came ? He said he came from Hammersmith with the Goods , and that he was carrying them to his Master , Mr Thomas Wilkes . However , I carry 'd both him and the Goods to the Watch-house , and went in the Morning to enquire of Mr. Wilkes , If the Prisoner was to bring him any Goods from Hammersmith ? Mr Wilkes said , - No , d-mn him , I know nothing of him . Upon this the Prisoner and the Goods were carried before Mr. Justice Poulson . Mrs Fleetwood saw them and swore to them : and I swear they were the same Goods which I took upon the Prisoner in a Sack . When the Prisoner was before Mr Poulson , he said he let down the Window-Shutter , and took a Pane of Glass out of a Window backwards , and open 'd the Casement , and so got into the Kitchen ; and he told us he got out again the same Way he got in . He did not tell us what Time he did this , but he own 'd he carried away the Goods , and it was between 4 or 5 o'Clock , - before Day-break , when I stopp 'd him . Prisoner . If I would have given him a Shilling , he would have let me gone off with the Goods . Robins . 'T is false ; he never offer 'd me any thing : but I took hold of his Collar , and carry 'd him down to the Watch-house . Guilty , Death . 152. James Bartlet , of St. Mary Woolnoth , was indicted for stealing a Silver Spoon , val . 10 s. the Goods of Benj Wilding and Anne Drake , Feb. 4 . Mr. Wilding . I keep the Pope 's Head Tavern , in Cornhill , and Mrs Drake is my Partner . We l ost a Silver Spoon , on the 4th of Feb. after which , I was sent for by Mr. Brathwaite , a Silversmith in Lombardstreet , who shewed me a Spoon which I believ 'd was the same which I lost ; however , I went home and fetch 'd several more , and we compar 'd them together ; and Mr. Brathwaite sending for his Engraver , he discover 'd that the Mark which had been eras 'd , was the Pope 's Head , and said he could see it perfectly . Mr. Brathwaite 's Servant having told me he knew where the Man liv 'd who brought it to their Shop , I went with him the next Day to the Prisoner 's Lodging , and call 'd him out to me , and having a Constable ready , we took him , and brought him to my House ; where he confess 'd he convey 'd the Spoon from off the Bar , on the 4th of Feb. in the Evening , and that he carry 'd it to Mr Brathwaite , in order to sell it . He was carried to the Counter that Night , and the next Morning my Lord Mayor committed him . This is the Spoon . The . Church . Mr. Wilding sent for me to take Charge of the Prisoner ; and while we had him in his House , he own 'd he took the Spoon from the Bar , while the Drawer was gone for half a Pint of Wine , and that he had eras 'd the Mark which was upon it . He confess 'd the same before my Lord Mayor . - I have known the Prisoner some Years : He us 'd to clean Shoes about the Royal Exchange . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 153 , 154 , 155 . + Eliz Hales , Eliz Jarvis , and Frances Humphryes , of St . Brides , were indicted for assaulting Charles Dickerson , in the Dwelling-House of Godfrey Nodder , putting him Fear , & c. and taking from him a Barragon Coat , val . 25 s. a Pair of Gloves , val . 12 d. a Hat , 3 s. a Cambrick Stock , and a Bathmetal Stock-buckle , val . 6 d. and a green Parchment Pocket-Book , val . 6 . Feb. 24 . Charles Dickerson . Last Sunday Evening between 10 and 11 at Night , I was going home to the Middle Temple lane , and , as I went up Fleet-Street , Jarvis asked me to give her a Dram . I told her I would not : but she followed me , and at last I consented , and upon her Importunity , I agreed to give her a Dram . Accordingly we went to Godfrey Nodder 's House , in Hanging-Sword Court , a little above Salisbury Court , in Fleetstreet . - 'T is a Sort of a publick House ; they sell strong Liquors in it , but 't is not an Alehouse , nor did I ever drink in the House before . Jarvis went up one pair of Stairs as soon as we went in , and I follow 'd her . When we were got into the Room , she called for a Quartern of Rasberry ; and after we had drank the Rasberry , I call 'd to know what I must pay for it ? they told me , 6 Pence . I said it was too much , and was not willing to pay 6 Pence for it , but they swearing I should pay 6 Pence , I paid it , and was going away about my Business . Then Jarvis and Humphreys stopp 'd me , and Hales coming up Stairs at the same time , they all three insisted on my staying longer , and that I should give them a Shilling a-piece . I told them I had made no such Agreement with them , and that I had only promis 'd to give Jarvis a Dram . On my refusing to give them a Shilling a-piece , Jarvis and Humphreys took me round the Body , and flung me upon the Bed ; then Hales got upon me , and held me down , and almost throttled me . I turned Jarvis and Humphreys off from me , and at last I got off the Bed from Hales . They were all three upon me at the same time , on the Bed ; but when I had disengaged myself from them , and was got off the Bed , they all three came about me again , and swore they would have my Waistcoat , and Hales tore open the Buttons both of my Coat and Waistcoat , and Humpbreys swore , if I made any Resistance , she would rip me open . Then they took from me my Coat , swearing by their Eyes , that it was better than my Waistcoat ; they likewise took my Hat , my Stock and a Bath-metal Stock-buckle , and a Pair of Gloves They unbuttoned my Breeches next , and ransack 'd all my Pockets , and took five Pence halfpenny from me , which I have not put in the Indictment . After they had thus robb 'd me , Jar-vis and Hales kept me in hold , while Humphreys carried my Things down Stairs , and when she had convey 'd them away , I was turned out of Doors . Upon this I went back ( in my Waistcoat , and withthout my Hat , to some Friends that I had been with all the Afternoon , and having told them how I had been serv 'd , this Man ( Charles Tates ) went back with me to the House , and I went in at the Fore-door and found Humphreys and Hales . I asked them for my Things ; Humphreys pretended to be asleep , but Hales told me she knew nothing about them ; she said she only knew that I had had a Quartern of Rasberry , and had paid for it . While we were talking to Hales and Humphreys , some other Friends came from the Place where I found Mr. Yates , and they brought a Watchman with them . After they were come in , Hales fell down upon her Knees , and protested that she knew no more of the Affair , than my only having had a Quartern , and paying for it ; afterwards they both pretended that I had promis 'd them a Shilling each , and that I had left my Coat for one Shilling , and my Hat for another . We then took them both ( Hales and Humpbreys ) to St. Bride 's Watch-house , and had them secur 'd . Soon after this , Mr. Gordon ( at whose House the Coat was left ) took Farvis , and brought her to us , and she was likewise secur 'd with the others . Next Morning they were carry 'd before Sir John Barnard , and they own 'd I had been in their Company , and that I had not offer 'd any thing ( uncivil ) to them , - only that I had given them a Dram . They pretended , indeed , that I had left my Coat and my Hat for two Shillings , but they gave no Account what they took the rest of my things for . Upon my Oath , the three Prisoners are the Per sons ; and I offered no Indecency to them , nor did I leave any thing with them in lien of Money , as they pretended . Jarvis . When Mr. Gordon gave you your Coat again , did not you find your Gloves , and Stock and Buckle in the Coat-Pocket . Dickerson No . Jarvis . If we attempted to throttle you , you may have Marks to shew . Have you any ? Dickerson . No . William Gordon . On Sunday Night last , I had been from Home and when I returned , I was told that Elizabeth Jarvis had thrown a Coat into our House . I went out to see after her , and found her by St. Bride 's Watch-House . I asked her how she dared take the Liberty to leave such Things at my House ? Lord , Mr. Gordon , says she , there 's no Harm in it , for the Man left it with me for 2 Shillings . I had heard that Dickerson had been robbed of his Coat , so I told her , I cared not who left it with her , nor what it was left for , she must go with me ; so I took her to the Barley-Mow in Salisbury-Court , and enquired for the Man who had lost his Coat . The Prosecutor came out to me in his Waistcoat ; I asked him if he knew that Woman ? He said Yes , and told me he had got the other two in Custody , and now he had them all . I told him , I had got his Coat safe , and took him and Jarvis with me to my House , and when I produced the Coat to the Prosecutor , I asked him if that was his Coat ? He told me it was . - ( I believe he has got it now upon his Back ) - Upon his owning the Coat , I gave it to him , and said , - there 's your Coat , and there 's the Woman that left it in my House . Then we carried her to the Watch-house , and the Prosecutor charged her in Custody with the other two , whom I knew nothing of . The Coat , which the Prosecutor owned , was the same which Jarvis acknowledged she had thrown into my House . Charles Yates . The Prosecutor , I , and others had been in Company together , that Night , at the Barley-Mow in Salisbury-Court : He left us there something after 10 , and told us he would go home ; but he returned to us again , in Half an Hour , without his Coat and Hat , and said he had been stripped in Hanging-Sword-Court . By the Advice of the rest of the Company , I went with him to the House , to see if we could recover his Things . He shewed me the House , and I knocked at the Door ; Hales opened it , and I saw all the 3 Prisoners in the Room ; but Jarvis leaped away [ thro ' a Passage which is wainscotted off ] the Minute I got in . The Prosecutor followed me into the House , and Humpbreys pretending to be asleep , I asked Hales if they knew what they had been about ? I bid them give the Man his Things again , and said , - You 'll get no good by what you have done , for he 'll certainly prosecute you . Hales pretended at first , that she knew nothing of them : afterwards she said , he had left his Coat and Hat with them for 3 Shillings . We had not been long in the House , before 3 or 4 Men , whom we left at the Barley-Mow , came after us : I opened the Door and let them in . Then Hales fell down on her Knees , and said if the Man would stay a little while , he should have all his Things again . Accordingly we staid , but she being dilatory , we charged a Watchman , ( who came with our Friends ) with both Her and Humpbreys , and they were sent that Night to the Counter . When we had done this , we agreed to go and have one Pot more at the Barley-Mow , and while we were drinking it , Mr. Gordon came with Jarvis , and asked for the Man who had lost his Coat ? The Prosecutor knew her again , and we all went to Mr. Gordon 's House , and the Coat being produced , the Prosecutor owned it , and Jarvis acknowledged she had left it there : Upon which she was carried to the Counter with the other two Prisoners . John Hickman gave the same Account with the preceding Witness . The Prisoners had no Witnesses to call either to the Fact , or to their Character , and insisted upon it in their Defence , that the Prosecutor left his Coat and Hat with them , as Pledges for 2 Shillings . The Jury found them all Guilty , Death . 156 . + John Sawney , of St Martins in the Fields , was indicted for assaulting Sarah Cockram on the King 's Highway , putting her in Fear , & c. and taking from her a cloth Cloak , val . 12 s. January 29 . The Witnesses , at the Prisoner 's Request , were examined apart . Sarah Cockram . On the 29th of January , a little after 7 at Night , I had been to see a Gentlewoman who lay ill , in Russel-Court . As I returned home , thro ' Drury-Lane , the Prisoner followed me very close , from Colson's-Court , and when I came to the End of Earl's-Court , he came up to me , and asked me , which was the Sign of the Sun ? Upon my telling him I did not know the Sign , he asked me if I was a Stranger thereabouts ? I said , Yes : - for I live in Dirty-Lane , in Long-Acre . There were 2 Women came out of Earl's-Court , while he was speaking to me ; else I believe he would have put his Design into Execution there : but being prevented , he followed me close to my Shoulders , and asked me , if I would go and drink part of a Pint of Beer with him ? I told him I was not such a Person as he took me for ; upon which he damn 'd me , and put his Hand to the Inside of the Neck of the Cloak which I had then on , and tore it . The String being hard to break , I was almost choak 'd , which obliged me to secream out very much : but he never quitted his Hold , till he got it off , and then he put it under his left Arm , and ran away . Mr. Russel a Tallow-Chandler came out , and asked me what was the Matter ? I told him , a Soldier had robb 'd me of my Cloak , and I am sure Man , for I saw him by the Light of the Candles in the Shops . After the Prisoner had robb 'd me , he ran up Earls-Court , and Mr. Russel pursu 'd him directly , with Mr. Roberts the Apothecary , and they took him behind a Door . I follow 'd Mr. Russel and Mr. Roberts , and was close to the Threshold of the Door , when-they took him . At Colonel De Veil 's , he used both him , and the Gentlemen that seized him , in a very vile manner , and swore he would hamstring me , whenever he met me . He own 'd the Fact ; and Mr. De Veil told him he had a great deal of Impudence : upon which he said , Yes , and he could own the Fact before him , and could deny it when he came before the Judge . - I was put in so much Fear when he robb 'd me , that I did not come to myself for several Days afterwards . Prisoner . Ask her whether she found the Cloak in my Custody ? Cockram . When he was behind the Door , he threw it about 2 Yards from him in the Entry . Prisoner . Can you justify my throwing the Goods away ? I never handled the Cloak . I know no more of it than a dying Man . Cockram . This is the Cloak which was taken up in the Entry , and it is mine . Edward Roberts . I am an Apothecary in Drury-lane . On the 29th of January , about half an Hour after 7 in the Evening , as I was in my Shop , I heard an Outcry of Stop Thief . I ran out , and saw the Prisoner running with all his Might on the other Side of the Way . He turned up Earl's-Court ; I ran after him , and cry 'd Stop Thief , and I believe he cry 'd Stop Thief too . About the middle of Earl's-Court , there is a Turning on the Right-Hand , that goes into Red-Lion-Court , and there I lost sight of him . But at the Corner of the Court I met James Henley , ( a Boy ) and the Woman having told me he had robb 'd her of a Cloak , and was run with it under his Arm , I ask 'd him if he had seen such a Man ? and told him , I was afraid he had escap 'd . No Sir , says he , there 's no Thorough-fare there ; so I went up the Court , and the Boy telling me he was gone into one of the Houses in Fountain-Court , I opened a Door on the Right-Hand , and asked a Woman , who was coming down Stairs with a Candle , if a Soldier was not come in with a Cloak ? She seeming very much surpriz 'd , I looked in , and finding the Prisoner close up behind the Door , I seiz 'd him , and brought him out : I am sure he 's the Man . Mary Birt . The Prisoner is the Man that was behind the Door , when I came down Stairs with the Candle . This was the 29th of January , about half an Hour past 7 . He was taken in our Entry by Mr. Roberts , and I took up the Cloak about 2 Yards from the place where he had concealed himself . Abraham Russel . On the 29th of January , between 7 and 8 at Night , I heard the Prosecutor cry out Stop Thief , as I was in my Master 's Shop , a Tallow-chandler in Drury-lane . She told me a Soldier had robb 'd her of her Cloak , and shew 'd me where he was running . I pursued him thro ' Earl's-Court , and Red-Lion-Court , into Fountain-Court ; at the Corner of which Place Henley told me where the Prisoner ran . There was no one with me at this Time , but a Fellow-Servant of mine , so I did not care to go any farther ; but as the Court was not a Thorough-fare , I stood at the Entrance of it , and bid Henley go and call somebody to assist me . He went and brought Mr. Roberts and Mrs. Cockram to me . Then we went into the Court , and seeing a Door stand open , we found the Prisoner concealed behind it , and carry 'd him before Colonel De Veil , where he told Mr. Roberts , he wanted a new Perriwig , and now by his being apprehended , there would be Money for him to buy one . He damn 'd Mrs. Cockram , and said , he never saw her nor her Cloak neither ; and when his Charge was reading , he said they need not read any more , there was enough to hang him . James Henley confirmed the two former Witnesses , in that part of their Evidences which related to him . Francis Blakesly 's Evidence was to the same Effect , with that of Mr. Roberts , Mr. Russel , and Mrs Birt . Prisoner . I have no witnesses ; and all I have to say is , that I know no more of the Cloak than one that never was born . Guilty , Death . 157.

Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 158. Elizabeth Surridge of St. Marin 's in Fields , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Kneebuckle , val . 1 s. a Stuff Purse , val . 1 d. a Moidore , and 5 Guineas , from the Person of Thomas Neal , February 18 . Thomas Neal . Last Monday was Sevennight , I was coming from my Horses , which I had put up at the White Hart , in Shug lane , near Piccadilly , and as I came by the Rose in Oxenden-street , ( kept by one * Marmaduke Bignell and Rose Mabone ) the Prisoner stood at the Door , and asked me to give her something . It was about 8 o'Clock at Night , and I told her I could not stay . She ask 'd me to give her a Quartern of Brandy ; I comply 'd , and went into the House ( the Rose ) with her ; and she took a Candle off the Bar , herself , and carried me into a Room up two pair of Stairs . The Drawer brought up a Quartern of Brandy , and I gave him 6 d. for it ; then he retired , and left the Prisoner and me together , and she told me I must give her Half a Crown for obliging me with her Company . I gave her 6 d. but she thinking that too little , I believe I gave her another . I was sober , tho ' I ca n't be sure how much Money I gave her , - I believe 18 d. was the outside . While we were together , I put my Hand in my Pocket , and miss 'd my Purse . I charg 'd the Prisoner with having pick 'd my Pocket ; and she said , she had none of my Purse , she would assure me , nor my Money neither . When the Drawer came up , I told him she had robb 'd me : He said , he did not understand the Nature of it , - as we came in we must go out , and so the Prisoner went down Stairs with him into the Kitchen . I follow 'd , and told the Landlady , that she had pick 'd my Pocket : She said - Perhaps you have dropp 'd it above Stairs , go up with the Drawer , and look for it , and I 'll be bound for the Prisoner 's staying here , till you come down . But while I was hunting about the Room for my Money , she let the Prisoner escape ; and as I imagined they had it among them , I offered them a Guinea to let me have it again . When I found there was nothing to be done , I went home ; and the next Morning I told my Master 's Landlord ( where we lodged ) what had happened ; and we went directly to Col. De Veil for a Warrant to take the Prisoner ; but not knowing her Name , we came away without one . Afterwards , as I was coming along Covent-Garden , I saw the Prisoner and another Woman with her in the Street , and told our Landlord , that was the Person who robbed me . I crossed the Street in order to pursue her , and a Cart coming by at the same Time , she turned to avoid the Cart , and came directly upon me . Then I caught hold of her , and said , Now , Madam , I have you . Both she and the other Woman immediately desired me not to expose her , and I should have my Money again , but as she had squandered some of it away , they hoped I would allow her something hand-some , for herself . Upon this I went with them again to the Rose , and asked her to give me my Money ; but there being 3 or 4 Bullies in the Kitchen , one of them , - a Great Fellow , - said the Prisoner was his Wife , and that he would knock me through the Wall ; and immediately they sell upon me , 2nd the Man that was with me ; but I got out of the House first , and he got from them afterwards . Then I stood at the outside of the-Door , while my Friend went for a Constable ; and as I stood at the Door , the Landlord of the House would have fain persuaded me to come in again , and drink with him : I refused , and when they found I would not come in again , one of the Fellows in the House cried , - d - mn you , Madam , come out with me : which she did , and I followed them cross the Hay-Market , and he put her up a pair of Stairs ; then he came down to me and said , - there , d - mn you , now get her if you can . People about me said , she could not get out from that Place without being seen , so I got my Land-lord to stand at the bottom of the Stairs , while I went to Mr. Justice Frasier for a Warrant . After which we took her , and carried her before Colonel De Veil , who committed her . She made no Confession at all . * See the following Trial Thomas Corner ( the Person who assisted in taking the Prisoner ) confirmed part of the former Evidence . Prisoner . Ask him if he did not say , he had but 2 Shillings in the World , when he paid for the Quartern of Brandy ? Neal . I might say so , because I did not care such Company should know what I had about me . I had a Moidore , 5 Guineas , and some odd Silver in my Purse , which was in my Pocket when I came from my Horses , for I had some Beer at that Place , and saw my Money when I paid for it : and when I gave the Prisoner some Silver in the Room , I fumbled in my Pocket , and pulled out a Six-pence or two from the Gold , without pulling out my Purse . While I was with her , I felt her Hand in my Pocket , and bid her keep them above board . Prisoner . He said he would swear a Robbery against me , because I would not let him be uncivil : and in less than a Quarter of an Hour afterwards , he picked up 2 Women , and carried them to the next Door , and drank Wine with them : telling them he had been with an ill-natured Girl , but they , he hoped , would be better tempered . Sarah Hilliard . I saw the Prisoner and the Prosecutor come together out of the Rose , in Oxendon-street , between 8 and 9 o'Clock . He told her , he would be even with her , for the 2 s. which he gave her , because she had not stood to her Bargain . Two Women , who were coming by at the same Time , told the Prosecutor , it would go with them they would make a sure Bargain ; so they brought him to our House , [ we h just the next Door to the Rose ] and Ribecca Brown and I being at the Door , she went in and served them with Wine : after which , she went out for some Sugar , and I being called in , to take the Reckoning , I heard him say , you are good-natured ; but as for that other B - ch , I 'll be even with her . When he went out , he asked me , if he could lie in the House all Night ? But I told him the Gentlewoman that kept it , ( one Mrs Brown ) was out , and I could say nothing to it . Ann Pollard swore much to the same Effect . Neal . Upon my Oath , all these two Women have said is false : I never was in that House in my Life . Elizabeth Poulter . I am a Washerwoman , and live in Wardour-street , Old Sobo . I have known the Prisoner a great while ; she is a Mantua-Maker , and I never heard any Harm of her in my Life . Mary Whilt on swore she had known the Prisoner a great while : she had never heard of her having done an ill Thing , and was surprized she should have done so now . Acquitted . 159 , 160. Marmaduke Bignell and Richard Ford , of St James Westminster , were indicted for stealing a Guinea , a half Guinea , and 2 s. and 6 d. in Money ; the Property of Thomas Jones , Feb. 24 . Tho Jones . On Sunday Evening last , I had been at Church ; and as I was going home I met a young Woman in the Street , about 9 at Night , and she asked me to give her a Glass of Wine at the Prisoner Bignell 's House . Accordingly I went with her thither , - it is the Rose in Oxendon-street . They call it a Tavern , but they sell Brandy as well as Wine , - I could get no Beer there . We went up one pair of Stairs , and called for Wine , and when the Reckoning was to be paid , I told the Drawer , I wanted Change for half a Guinea . He bid me give him the half Guinea first . I said , I would not trust him with it , but bid him bring me the Silver , and then I would give him the half Guinea , Upon this the Landlady came up , and bid me give her the half Guinea , that she might see whether it was good . I then pull 'd out my Money and put it into my Hat , telling her if she would tell down 10 s. and 6 d. on the Table , if the half Guinea should not be good , she should have the Guinea , which I had in my Hat . She refused to do this , and while we were disputing , the Prisoner Bignell came up , and asked her why she did not go down Stairs , when she was wanted below ? Says she , the Gentleman wo n't let me have the half Guinea . Bignell immediately thrust his hand into my Hat , and damning me for a Rascal , he snatched away the Guinea , and 2 s. & 6 d. in Silver . My Hat , and the half Guinea fell down upon the Ground . Ford , who was still in the Room , pick 'd up the half Guinea , and gave it to his Master Bignell . Upon this I pulled out a Penknife , and clapping my Back against the Door , I swore I would kill or be kill 'd , before I would lose my Money : Then Bignell knock 'd upon the Floor with his Heel , and cried Murder ; immediately three or four Bullies came up , and swore they would knock my Brains out , if I would not get down Stairs , d - mning me , and asking me , what Business I had there ? and they took up the long-back 'd Chairs to knock my Brains out . I thought best to go down Stairs , and Bignell came down likewise ; but being unwilling to lose my Money , I went into the Kitchen , or back Room . There they d - mn 'd me again for a Rascal , and bid me get out ; so I went out telling Bignell , I would make him suffer for it . He bid me do my worst , telling me his Name was Bignell , and that he lived at the Sign of the Rose . When I came out , I enquired after his Name , and finding he had told it me right , I got a Warrant and apprehended him . John Williams knew nothing of the Fact , but gave the Prosecutor the Character of an honest young Fellow , who work 'd hard for his Bread . Bignell . He says he had 2 s. and 6 d. in Silver : What Occasion then had he for Change ? Jones . I intended to have lain there all Night , and imagined I should want more Silver , for I intended to make the young Woman a Present of the Half-Crown which I then had . Bignell . I shall only call some Witnesses , to prove I was at another Place last Sunday Night . Ford . I never saw the Man , before he took me up with a Warrant . Joseph Mills . I keep the Red Lion Alehouse near the Haymarket . Bignell came last Sunday Night to my House , about 6 o'Clock , and staid in my House to drink Part of 6 Pots of Beer . To the best of my Knowledge , he was never out of the House , ( except when he went into the Yard to make Water ) till he went home , - and that was at about 11 o'Clock . Oxendon-street is about four Stones-throw , or hardly three , from my House , but he could not go out , for I was never out of his Company all that Time , but when I went to draw a Pot of Beer , or so . - I think I went out twice with two Pots of Beer just cross the Way , but I did not stay above a Minute . - I was not longer in going and coming . - Not two Minutes I am sure . I dress Buttock of Beef on a Sunday , and give a Bit away to my Neighbours . I ask 'd him if he would eat any ? He said no , but desired me to send a Bit to his Wife , I have known him four Years ; and have been out with him this late frosty Weather a shooting , with Money in my Pocket , and never saw or heard any thing ill of him . James Harper . I live in Mills 's House , and I came home last Sunday Night about 6 o'Clock . Bignell was then drinking in the House , and I was with him till near 11 , and I am sure he never went once out of the House , I ca n't say I know the Prisoner ; - I never was in his Company before . William Hampton . I went to Mills 's last Sunday Night , between 6 and 7 , for a Pint of Beer , as I usually do , and saw Bignell , and two or three more , sitting by the Fire . I had been about three or four times in his Company before , so I staid with him till half an Hour after 10 , and I am sure he was there all that Time . I know nothing at all of the Prisoner Ford , - and as to Bignell 's Character , - I ca n't say as to that , - I never heard any Harm of him . Edmund Dobbins . I was in Company with Bignell , and I believe I staid 2 Hours with him . When I first came to Mills 's , I said , - Mr. Bignell , I have taken a House in Rupert-Street , and if you 'll come and sup with me , you shall be welcome . I went to Mills 's to see for 2 or 3 young Fellows that belong to the Market , for I am a Poulterer 's Son , and keep as good a House as any Man in the Parish . - I had as much Victnals drest that Day , as cost me 30 Shillings . ' I was about 7 o'Clock when I came in to Mills 's , and Bignell telling me he could not go to sup with me , and that he should be glad of my Company at Mills 's , I staid with him 2 Hours and a half . I have known him 4 Years : he 's an honest Man , and endeavoured to live , as far as I have heard . John Pillar . I came to Mills 's between 5 and 6 last Sunday Night , to get my Supper , as usual . While I was there Bignell came in ; I did not see him go out of the House all the Time I was there . and I did not go away till after 11 . If he had gone out , I must have seen him , because I was in the same Room with him all the Time . - As to his Character , - I ca n't say that I have known him but a very little Time . John Adams , Thomas West , John Jones , and Terence Givers , knew Bignell , and never heard any Thing amiss of him , as to Dishonesty , before . Jane Crumpton , Mary Parsons , Anne White , and Mills , ( at the Red-Lion ) spake to the same Effect , with Relation to Ford . The Prosecutor desiring a Gentleman upon the Bench might be ask 'd if he knew the Prisoners , he deposed , That he knew them both , and that their Characters were the very worst , in all the City and Liberty of Westminster . That the House Bignell kept ( the Rose ) was a notorious , infamous , thieving House ; that he had known both the Prisoners many Years ; that they had been brought before him several Times , upon Charges for Felony ; that the Woman he called his Wife , one Rose Mabone , was an infamous Person , both he and she having been several Times charged with Felonies , which they afterwards compounded ; that Rose Mabone had been tried for Felony , and that the House they kept was the worst House in Westminster , except that which was kept by * Eastmead , Bignell 's Master . * See the Sessions-Book for July , No . 390 . Jury to Dobbins the Poulterer . ] How far do you live from the Prisoner Bignell ? Dobbins . About 3 Stones-throws : I am sure I never heard a bad Character of the House , since Bignell kept it . It had a bad Character before but Bignell has altered the Sign , and has wrote under it , - The Case is alter 'd . A Gentleman . We had this very House complain 'd of , to the Justices , but last Week : it is a notorious ill House , as any in the whole Parish , and upon every Complaint they shift their Land-lords , that we have not been able to come at them . The Gentleman who was called upon by the Prosecutor declared farther , that the Characters of several of the Prisoners Witnesses were no better than their 's , tho ' others of them were honest with Respect to their Business ; but that Mills , in particular , had been several Times brought before him for Felony . Both Guilty . [ Transportation .

Nov. 3 . Philip Lipscomb . About 4 Months ago , the Prisoner and I broke open Mr Lane 's Garden Gate , at Hackney , between 11 and 12 at Night , and we both got into the Garden : then he lifted me up on the Top of an Arbour joining to the House , and I got out 2 Pins belonging to the Window-Shutter , and the Shutter fell down : then I try 'd to get into the House , but I could not get thro ' the Window ; upon which the Prisoner bid me come down , and pull my Cloaths off ; which I did , and then got in and open 'd the Back-door , and then let him in . We took away 2 Quilts , a large Copper , 2 Curtains , 2 Blankets , and 3 Saucepans , which we ty 'd up , and carry 'd off in 2 Loads ( between us ) to the Prisoner 's House . The Copper we sold to one Birch , a Smith ; the other Things we shar 'd between us : there were several other Goods taken , which I have not mentioned . Mr. Lane . I have a House at Hackney , which is lock 'd up when we are in Town . The beginning of November the Garden-Door , which we left locked , was broke upon ; a Window-Shutter one pair of Stairs , and a Sash-Window , were broke , and the Things mentioned in the Indictment were taken away . The Gardiner , who looks after the House , brought me Word the next Day , that my House had been broke open and-robbed , and these 2 Pictures , which have been in my Family these 100 Years , were sent to me , by the Evidence Lipscomb . Lipscomb . I know the Pictures very well : one of them is cracked in the Frame . I took them off the Chimney when we robbed the House . Some of the Goods we sold ; and some of them the Prisoner has now got at home . The Copper and the Saucepans we sold together , but the Persons who bought them are run away . Mr. Lane . The Persons who bought the Goods are gone off . Prisoner . When was this Robbery committed ? Mr. Lane . I think it was the 3d of November . Prisoner . I was at home and a-bed at that Time ; but I very seldom call People to see me a-bed , so I have no Witnesses to that : but I am a Bricklayer ; a hard-working Man . and an honest Man ; and I work 'd for Mr Dussield in Shoreditch , till he dy 'd .

Thomas Love , for receiving a Coral , mounted with Silver , knowing them to be stole . Joseph Crane . I live at Bow , and my House was broke open on the 30th of December , between 10 at Night and 7 in the Morning . The Parlour-Window was broke , and 2 Bolts wrenched off , with which ( I am sure ) the Window was made fast at 10 o'Clock at Night . I found it broke about 7 in the Morning , and the Sash stood up . All the Goods mentioned in the Indictment were taken away , and were my Property , except the 8 Yards of Cloth , which was my Brother 's . The Breeches and the Shoes were in the Entry , and all the rest of the Things were in the Parlour . The Tea-kettle I remember to have seen at 10 o'Clock at Night . - It was break of Day when I got up in the Morning , and was light enough to distinguish one Man 's Face from another 's . I advertised the Goods immediately , and the Monday following one Mr Bowler came and told me , he believ 'd his Son had bought the Fender and the Tea-kettle of Richard Birch . I went down to Bowler 's , and swore they were mine : then we went to see after Birch in Bluecoat-fields , but not finding him , I was advised to lie still for some Time , But about three Weeks afterwards , we found a Piece of the green Cloth pawn 'd at Mrs Dodgings , in Bluecoat-fields : we took her before a Justice , and she informing us , that the Cloth was pawned to her by the Evidence 's ( Lipscomb 's ) Wife , we got a Warrant for her , and took her : she was committed to Prison , and the Prisoner was taken as he was carrying Victuals to her in Goal , and this Gun screw , which I swear is mine , was found in his Pocket . James Gill . I searched the Prisoner , and found this Knife , and that Gun-screw in his Pocket , which Mr Crane has sworn to . The Prisoner told us he found it in Lipscomb 's Nail-box , when he came to help him move his Goods . Philip Lipscomb . Wicks , Richard Birch , and I broke open Mr Crane 's House , the 29th or 30th of December , - the Sunday-Night after Christmas Day , - between 12 and 1 o'Clock . We took Wick 's Lathing-Hammer , which he carried out in his Apron , and wrenched open a Window-shutter , which had 2 Bolts upon it . 'T was a Parlour Window next the Street-door , going into the Yard . Then Wicks lifted up the Sash , and took out a Pewter-Plate which stood within his Reach : after which , he lifted me in at the Window , and I handed out a Tea-kettle , a brass Fender , a silver Coral engraved , a large silver Spoon , with a Scallop-Shell upon the Heel of it . A silver Tea-Spoon , 7 pieces of pickled Pork in a Pan , a pair of Stockings , and a China Saucer . These Things I found in the Parlour . The Breeches hung upon the Bannisters of the Stairs , in the Passage , and the Shoes were under the Stairs . Among the things we carried away , there was a Gun-screw , with a bit broke off from the sharp End of it . - This is the same . The Tea-Kettle we let fall , as we were carrying the Goods away upon our Backs , and it being bruised , Birch beat it out upon his Anvil , and then carried out that and the Fender , and sold them for a Crown , as he told us . Mrs Birch pawned the Spoon for a Crown and brought us the Money , and we had Twenty-pence a-piece . The Pork was divided among us ; we had 2 Pieces each , and the odd Piece we eat among us . The Cloth was likewise shared , and each of us had a Piece . The Prisoner Love bought the Coral for 8 s. and a Quartern of Brandy . Wicks and I have been acquainted 7 or 8 Years ; he worked with the Master to whom I served my Time : and I have known Love about the same Time , he sells a Dram at St Giles 's , but I believe he knew nothing of my Life and Conversation . I was speaking to my Sister about the Coral , and she told me Mr Love would buy it of me . Accordingly I offere it to him ; he asked me if it was safe ? and I told him yes , and that I did not care to offer it to a Silversmith for fear he should doubt me . All the Money we sold the Goods for , was divided etween Wicks , Richard Birch , and myself . Wicks . Where did you lie , that Night this Robbery was committed ? Lipscomb . At Mr. Birch 's House . She called me up , to go out upon this Account with her Husband ; then we knocked Wicks up , and went and committed this Fact . I lay that Night , in the same Room with Birch and her Husband ; she knew what I was , and used to let us bring in Goods , at all Hours of the Night . Love . Did not your Sister bring the Coral to me ? Lipscomb . My Sister shewed him the Coral , but she told him 't was mine , and I was in the Room at the same Time . 'T was in a Room he calls his Kitchen , and he was a-bed when it was offered him . He ordered me a dram of Gin , and asked me what I would have for it ? I asked 12 s. for it , then I came down to 10 s. 6 d. and at last to 8 s. which he consented to give me , and a Quartern of Brandy . I had not seen Love for 5 or 6 Years before my Sister carried me to him with the Coral . As to Wicks he wanted to be made an Evidence , and went with that intent before Mr Justice Priestly , but the Justice would not admit him . Griffin Crane . By the Direction of Wicks I found 3 Yards of my Cloth at one Mr Colebecks , in Whitecross-Street , in the Park , Southwark . Another Piece I found at Mrs Dodgings , - about a Yard and a half , which was pawned to her for a Shilling . Another was made into a Petticoat , which we took off Lipscomb 's Wife 's Backside , in New-Prison : and by her Direction we found this large silver Spoon , at one Mr Holmes 's a Pawnbroker in Ratclisse-Highway , where Mrs Birch had pledged it for 6 Shillings . Edward Colebeck . The Prisoner Wicks brought me this Piece of green Cloth , and as he had lived 6 or 7 Years in the Neighbourhood , I thought him an honest Man , and lent him 2 s. upon it . Thomas Holmes . The Prisoner Mary Birch brought this Spoon to me , and told me it was her own , so I took it in , and lent her the Money on it . Wicks . I was not concerned in this Robbery ; Lipscomb told me he did it alone and by himself ; and that he had made a good Jobb of it . I had nothing to do with any of the Goods ; I only eat a bit of the Pork , which Lipscomb broiled upon the Tongs . Colebeck . I have known Wicks a great while , and heard no harm of him . Love . I knew nothing of the Coral 's being stole ; nor did I know he was a Thief . I have been married to his Mother these seven Years , and have bought him Cloaths a great many Times . Mr Crane . The Coral cost me 29 s. I believe 't is now worth 20 s. and he bought it for 8 s. Love . It broke in my Pocket , and the Coral came out : so I sent the Silver out yesterday to be sold , and had no more than 6 s. 6 d. for it . Wicks acquitted of the Burglary , but Guilty of the Felony . Birch and Love acquitted . [ Transportation .

Jan. 31 . Nathaniel Harris . I took the Prisoner on Suspicion of his having broke open a House in Wapping , last Saturday was se'n-night , and carried him before Mr Justice Jones , where he made an Information of some Robberies he had committed , and among them he acknowledged this Fact . This is the Information ; I saw Justice Jones sign it , and the Prisoner set his Mark to it . It was read over to him , and he afterwards signed it voluntarily , and without Compulsion . The Paper was read , and as much of it as related to the present Fact , was to the Effect following. `` This Informant faith , that he , together with `` Thomas Addley , and George Fleming , about a `` Month ago , broke open a House in Old Bedlam , `` near Bishopsgate-Street , from whence they `` stole 2 Gowns , and 2 Petticoats , which they `` delivered to Esther Moyer of Houndsditch . '' Harris . We made Enquiry after this Moyer , but she is not to be found . As we were carrying the Prisoner to Goal , he shewed us Mr Cowley 's f House , and told us . it was the House they broke open . Jane Cowley . My Husband is ill , and can not come out . All I know of the Matter is , that about 5 Weeks ago , I lock 'd my Door with a Padlock and went up Stairs to pass my Time with a Lodger above Stairs , because my Husband was then abroad . I came down again in half an Hour , and found the Door broke open , and the Padlock taken off ; and I missed several things , - a Damask Gown , which cost me 50 s. a black quilted Coat , and other things , which all belonged to me . When I fastened the Door and went up Stairs , it was not Daylight , not yet Candlelight , as one may say , for it was between 6 and 7 o'Clock . I believe I could have distinguished a Man 's Face , if I had seen it . - I never was in such a Broil as this in my Life before .

Jan. 11 . And the Indictment farther charged the said Holden , as above , with Intent to defraud Nicholas Allen of the said Sum . The Indictment farther charged the said Holden with uttering and publishing the said forged Receipt , in the Parish of Chelsea , Jan. 11 . 1739 . Mr. Little appearing to be concerned in Point of Interest , was not permitted to give Evidence . Nicholas Allen . Mr. Little is a Brewer ; and I have dealt with him ever since last May . The Prisoner was his Drayman , and by Mr. Little 's Order , I have paid the Drayman every Month for the Beer I have had in . I know this Note ; it is a Bill for 5 Quarter Barrels of Beer , and the Receipt at the Bottom of it is for 12 s. and 6 d. which the Beer comes to . I paid the Money to him for the Use of Mr. Little in full of all Demands . About a Fortnight before this Receipt was given me , Mr. Little 's Clerk brought me a Bill for Beer which I knew nothing of ; I told the Prisoner of it the next time he came , and he told me it was a Mistake , and that the Bill was intended for one Allen who lives at Westminster . However , to prevent Mistakes , I told him I would have a Receipt from his Matter , in full of all Demands , the next Money I paid him . Accordingly he brought me this Receipt , and said it came from his Master . I afterwards observed the Receipt was not dated , and in about three Days time the Prisoner coming again , I asked why it was not dated ? He told me his Master did not use to make such Mistakes , so he took a Pen and put a Date to it , telling me he believ 'd he could not write so well as his Master . He told me the Receipt was signed by Mr. Little , and I had never seen Mr. Little 's Hand-writing in my Life , as I know of , so I took it as a Receipt from his Master , who had given me Orders to pay the Prisoner , and had told me he was an honest Man : So I used to pay him , and take his Receipts for the Money , for the Use of Mr. Little . I have six other Receipts which the Prisoner has given me at different Times , and Mr. Little never saw any of them , till I demanded this Receipt in full from him . The Bill was read . Mr. Allen , Debtor . Dec. 7 . 1739 . 1/4 . the 14th 1/4 , Xt ( for Dec. the 19th ) 1/4 . Jan. 2 . 1/4 . the 9th 1/4 . B . ( as if it was cast up ) 5 quarters . Sum 12 s. and 6 d. Jan. 11 . 1739 . Receiv 'd the full Contents of this Bill , and all Demands , per John Little . Sum 12 s. 6 d. George Hanna . I am Clerk to Mr. Little ; and as we make out our Bills about Christmas , I carry 'd one to Mr. Allen . He told me he did not owe so much Money , for he had paid the Drayman every fourth Barrel , and he shew 'd me some of his Receipts . I said I would speak to the Drayman about it . I did so ; and the Prisoner then told me , he had seen Mr. Allen , and he ( Allen ) was now satisfy 'd that my Bill was right , and he would pay me whenever I went that Way . The whole Account of Mr. Allen , as charged in our Ledger , and in the Runner at Home , is 1 l. 17 s. 6 d. 27 Shillings of which is still due , by our Books , from Mr. Allen : for we have receiv 'd no more than 10 s. since he dealt with us . This Receipt , now in question , is none of Mr. Little 's Writing , nor any Part of the Note ; nor is this 12 s. and 6 d. discharged in our Books , and the House-Clerk always enters the Money that is receiv 'd . When the Prisoner was examin 'd before Sir Edward Hill , he owned he wrote the Bill , and the Receipt , and sign 'd it with Mr. Little 's Name , and he had nothing to say for himself . Prisoner . When I told him Mr. Allen was satisfied , both he and my Master order 'd me to receive the Money , and give Mr. Allen a Receipt for it . Hanna . I did give him Orders to take the Money , if Mr. Allen was satisfy 'd ; but I did not give him Orders to write my Master 's Name to it . Prisoner . Did not I say before the Justice , that I did not intend to forge my Master 's Hand , nor to defraud him ? Hanna . I imagine he did it with Intent to defraud my Master ; for he has received more Money than ever he brought to Account , and more than ever he charg 'd Mr. Allen with in our Books . - I have seen the Prisoner write several Times , and I believe he endeavoured to imitate my Master 's Hand , in this Receipt ; but it is not well done ; it is pretty much like his own Handwriting . Thomas Baylis . I heard the Prisoner acknowledge before Sir Edward Hill , that both the Bill and the Receipt were his own Hand-writing . Prisoner . I did not deny what I had done , before Sir Edward Hill , because I knew I did not do it with a Design to forge any Thing , but to serve my Master , because Mr. Allen desired a Receipt in full , and I thought my own Name might not be a Discharge in full . The Jury acquitted the Prisoner . 171 . + John Ogden , of Harrow on the Hill , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of Thomas Vincent , between the Hours of 1 and 2 in the Night , and stealing a Moidore , 8 Guineas , 6 half Guineas , and 5 l. in Money , January 17 . Thomas Vincent . I am a Baker ; I live at Harrow on the Hill : the Prisoner had been my Servant , and left me a Fortnight before last Michaelmas . On the 18th of January , as I was coming from my Bed , to come down into the Bakehouse , my Apprentice called , and told me he fear 'd the House was broke open . I immediately went up a Ladder into the Kitchen , to the Place where my Money lay , and saw the Corner Cupboard broke open , and the Money gone . There was 18 l. 17 s. in it , but it was all taken away . One Piece was a Moidore , the rest were Guineas , half Guineas , and Silver , and among the Gold were 6 half Guineas . I went down immediately to the Boy in the Bakehouse , and told him I had lost my Money ; and seeing a Faggot mov 'd , and set in the Place where the Prisoner used to set them when he lived with me , I suspected him to have done it . When I came to look farther , I saw a Hole broke in the Wall in the Bakehouse , big enough for a Man to creep through . There is a Pair of flat Doors which lean against the House , and under these Doors there is Brickwork of 18 Inches or 2 Feet high : the Frame of the Doors is laid upon this Brick-work , and these Doors open into the Bakehouse . The Hole was made through this Brick-work ; therefore I thought it must be somebody that knew the House as well as I ; and I told my Boy , that I believ 'd it was the Prisoner who had done it ; and upon making Enquiry in the Country after him , a Countryman of his told me , he saw him the very Day before I was robb 'd in a very mean Capacity , and that the Shoes on his Feet were not worth 3 Pence . After this I had a Messenger came from Watford to tell me , he was seen there the Monday following , with a great deal of Gold and Silver in his Pockets , by John Runnington ; and from several other Circumstances I was confirmed in my Suspicion of the Prisoner , and at last I took him at the Running-Horse in David-Street , and carried him before Colonel De Veil , and there he said , he got this Money by a Bank Note of 15 Guineas , and deny 'd his being concerned in this Robbery . Colonel De Veil told him , there was no such Thing as a Bank Note for 15 Guineas ; and upon his second Examination he said , he had it from a young Woman who is now in Court , ( Anne Wood ) and that he was drunk , when he was first examined ; but he was as sober then , as I am now . One principal Reason of my suspecting the Prisoner , was the placing the Faggots : for they lay upon the Stairs at Night when I went to Bed : but when I got up they were moved , and set against the Wall , on the Right-hand of the Stairs , where the Prisoner always placed them , when he lived with me : besides , he had been lurking about the Country , and never had been in any Business , since he left my Service . I am sure the Faggots were moved , and that the Hole in the Wall was not there when I went to Bed , over Night at 9 or 10 o'Clock . I got up the next Morning between 5 and 6 ; 't was the 17th of January , and I believe it was not Day-light when I 'rose : but I ca n't be particular , whether it was Day-light , or Moon-light : 5 o'Clock is our usual Time of rising , and I believe it was about that Time . The Boy lies in the Bakehouse , and called to me before I came down Stairs , to tell me he was afraid the House was broke : and I saw the Hole the Minute I came down Stairs . If I was to die , I ca n't be sure , whether I had a Candle When I came down , but I believe I had one . The Money was in a white earthen Decanter , which holds two Quarts , and is large enough for me to put my Hand in , and the Silver was in one Bag and the Gold in another . I was so much surprized at the Loss of my Money , that though the Hole in the Wall was made quite through into the Street , yet I ca n't say whether I saw Day-light thro ' the Hole , or not . Prisoner . Did you always get up at an Hour when I lived with you ? Vinsent . Much about the same Hour . It was certain , as near as could be . Sometimes when we have been up a Night or two at Work , I may lie a little longer than ordinary , - but it is very rare I do . John Clark . I am above 15 Years old , and am Apprentice to Mr Vincent , and saw the Faggots removed and the Hole that was made in the Brickwork , that Night my Master was robbed , but I ca n't tell what day Day of the Month it was . I only know it was Thursday Night . The Faggots were removed from the Place where they were set over Night , and were put where the Prisoner always used to set them . While he liv 'd with my Master , I have often seen him loosening the Bricks where the Hole was made , but I can not say at what particular Time he loosened them , nor how near to the Time of his going away . I lie in the Bakehouse , and remember I saw Light come thro ' the Hole ; I thought it was Daylight , for I saw a Woman ( thro ' the Hole ) lighting her Fire on the other side of the Way . I think it was quite Light . Jury . Can you tell what Month it was , when this was done ? Clark . No ; but I believe it was 5 or 6 Weeks ago : and I believe it was between 5 and 6 in the Morning when I saw the Hole , so I was 'frighted , and lay till I heard my Master come down ; then I told him I was afraid he had been robbed . 'T was about 6 o'Clock when he came down . He uses to get up between 6 and 7 , that is his usual Time . When I told him the House was broke , he ran up into the Kitchen , and returned and told me he had lost 18 l. 17 s. and looked at the hole in the Wall . I am sure it was not there when we went to Bed . I heard a Noise twice in the Night , but I was not thoroughly awake , nor did I imagine any body was in the House , nor did I see the Hole at either of those Times when I heard the Noise . The first of my seeing the Hole was when the Light came in from the Woman 's Fire in an opposite House . When the Prisoner was taken up , he said , he had a Bank-Note from his Father for 15 Guineas , and he had changed the Note at a Banker 's , but he would not tell the Banker 's Name , he said he would take another Opportunity for that . Prisoner . Mention one Time when you saw me loosening the Bricks . Clark . I ca n't say what Day , or Month it was , but I have seen him doing it several Times . Jury . What did he loosen the Bricks with ? Clark . With nothing but his Hand ; and I observed they were loosened by his pushing them . I did not tell my Master of this , for he saw him as well as I. George Howard . I keep a Shoemaker 's Shop , at Pinner , two Miles from Harrow . One Thursday in January , ( but I ca n't tell the Day of the Month , to the best of my Knowledge , 't was the 17th ) the Prisoner came to my Shop , and asked for his Countryman , who had lived with me . I told him , he had been gone from me 3 Weeks before Christmas . Prisoner . That 's the Man that told Mr Vincent , I was in such a mean Condition . Howard . He was then in the same Cloaths , that he 's in now ; only he had Boots on then ; and when he was before the Justice he was in his Shoes . Prisoner . What Time did I leave you at Pinner ? Howard . Between 11 and 12 at Noon : He staid with me about half an Hour , and whither he went , when he left me , I know not . Prisoner . What Discourse passed between us ? Howard . That which I have mentioned . He likewise asked me when I saw Nan Wood , because ( said he ) I was to have been married to her last Monday , and instead of that , I came to London , and left her waiting at Watford , to be married . John Runnington . I was drinking with the Prisoner at Haddington , about 5 or 6 Weeks ago , and he pulled out some Gold , and offered to lend me a Guinea . I thanked him for his Love , and told him , I did not chuse his Money . Then he pulled out some Silver , and offer 'd me a Crown , a Half-crown , or a Shilling . I thanked him , and refused his Silver likewise . To the best of my Knowledge , he had about 8 or 10 Guineas in a Paper , and about 30 Shillings in Silver . He wanted me to come to London with him , but I told him my Money proved short , and I would go Home . William Dawes . In January last , ( but I ca n't tell what Day ) I came to London with the Prisoner , from Watford in Hertfordshire . He lodged with me a Night or two at the Coach and Running Horses in David-street . Then I missed him 1 or 2 Nights ( I ca n't tell which ) out of my Company . I ca n't tell what Nights they were , but when he returned , I saw a pretty deal of Money , 9 or 10 Guineas , and a Watch in his Pocket , and he had none when he left me , for I had paid 16 d. for him . He told me he had the Money from a Friend in Town ; and the Watch he said he had had these 7 Years ; but I never saw it before . I believe it was the 17th or 18th of Jan. when I miss 'd him , but I can not be sure . Prisoner . Did not the young Man , that came to Town with us , agree with me , to go again into the Country on Friday . Runnington . John Snoxon came to Town with us , and I heard such a Question asked , but I ca n't tell whether Snoxon agreed to go down again with the Prisoner . Prisoner . Ask him if I was not in his Company all Thursday Evening , and if I did not lie with him that Night ? Runnington . I ca n't be positive . On my Word I do n't know . Peter Merchant . I saw the Prisoner produce a Watch before the Justice , and it was a Watch I had sold about 6 or 7 Weeks before , for 3 l. 10 s. but I ca n't take on me to say , the Prisoner is the Man who bought it . Anne Wood . I thought the Prisoner had been an honest Man : He has borrow 'd Money of me several times ; he has had different Sums of me , from 10 s. to 20 s. never so much as 14 or 16 l. nor any at all in Jan. last . Prisoner . I was to have been married to her ; but I came to Town with some young Fellows , instead of going to be married . She knows I went to my Father 's in the Country , and brought up Money to be marry 'd to her . Wood . He went down into Northamptonshire about Michaelmas , and came up again after Christmas , with some Money ; but I know not how much . The Sums I lent him , were some before he went to see his Father , and some after , but none in January . Prisoner to Dawes . Did not I bear Snoxon 's Charges as we came to Town ? Dawes . He paid something for him , but I ca n't tell what . Acquitted . 172. Benj . Bellgrove was indicted for stealing 3 Ducks , val . 3 s. the Property of Mary Weedon , Jan. 30 . Guilty . 173. Margery Akers , alias Bunce , of St Bride 's , was indicted for stealing a Gold Watch , val . 12 l. a Silver wrought Snuff-box , val . 20 s. and 8 Guineas , the Property of , Jan. 25 . Mr W - . On Thursday the 24th of Jan. between 8 and 9 in the Evening , as I was coming down Sheer-lane , I saw a young Woman very genteelly dress 'd , and I stopp 'd to look at her . Some Conversation pass 'd between us , and I asked her to drink a Glass of Wine . She seemed a modest Woman , and said , No , she did not care for drinking , - she must go home . While we were talking together up came the Prisoner , and said she was going home , and if I pleased , I might go home with them . So we all went together to the Prisoner 's House in Green 's Rents . There was no Wine in the House , but she told us we might have a Tiff of Punch , but nothin g less than a 2 Shilling Tiff , and I paid for one Bowl before ever I tasted it . After this we had 5 or 6 more , and when it was between 12 and 1 o'Clock , I called for the Reckoning . The Prisoner told me she was a poor Widow-woman , and it would be Charity to assist her . I told her , it was late , and I did not care to go home , and as the Reckoning came to 12 s. if she would let me have a Bed , and a clean Pair of Sheets , there was a Guinea for her ; but , says I , if I want another Bowl , you will not stand with me for that . She was thankful , and told me she would not . Between 2 and 3 I went to Bed , and I am sure I had my Watch and Snuff-box then , for I took several Pinches of Snuff , and never went out of the Room , but into the Bedchamber , which was on the same Floor . I believe it was between 1 and 2 when I went to Bed , - near 2 . Between 3 and 4 I waked , and wanting a Pinch , I felt for my Coat , and searched my Pockets , but my Box was gone . This alarm 'd me , and made me turn about and put my Hand under my Pillow to feel for my Breeches , and I found my Watch gone . Then I felt in my Side-pocket , where I had crammed down my Purse with my Money , and feeling the Strings of it , I imagin 'd my Money was safe , but I afterwards found that was gone too . I told the young Woman , that her Landlady had robb 'd me . I ca n't imagine ( said she ) how the Woman could serve you so , - I always took her to be honest . Upon this I knock 'd with my Shoe upon the Floor , and a little Child came up and told me her Mother was gone out of Town . Why , says I , she was here an Hour or two ago , is she gone already ? Yes , says the Child , she is gone into the Country . I was in a good deal of Confusion and laid me down again , thinking I would stay till Daylight . About an Hour afterwards , I thought I heard somebody come in , so I call 'd again , and the Child came and told me her Mother was gone . I questioned the young Woman about it ; but she cry 'd , and said she never knew her guilty of such a Thing before . In the Morning I went away , and the Prisoner absconded : she never came to the House , except it was at Midnight ; for I set a Porter , who lived at next Door , to watch for her , and got a Warrant from Sir William Billers to apprehend her , if I could light of her ; but hearing nothing of her , I advertised the Things , and about a Fortnight afterwards , I had 2 Letters sent me to Will 's Coffee-House , and upon the Receipt of them , I went down to the Fleet , and saw the Prisoner coming to her Husband in the Prison , but she ran away as soon as she saw me . I knew her again , and by the Direction of one in the Prison , I took her next Morning at the Queen's-Head Alehouse , in Holborn . Counsel . Was the Door of the Room you lay in lock 'd , when you went to Bed ? W - . No . - When I took the Prisoner , she cry 'd and wrung her Hands , and said , - You 're a good-natur 'd Man , - you 'll not prosecute me if you have your Things again , and I have 5 Beds which I will sell , but you shall have Satisfaction . This was at the Justice 's Clerk 's House . Prisoner . Did I make the first Tiff of Punch for you ? W - . You brought it up , - I do n't know who made it . I own I had drank freely , and was a little elevated ; - I ca n't say I was drunk . I am certain I had the Things in my Pockets when I went to Bed . Mr Murden . I am a Prisoner in the Fleet . The Prisoner 's Husband was a School-Fellow of mine ; and he coming into the Fleet short of Money , I took him into my Room from Saturday to Tuesday . In that Interim the Prisoner often came to him , and I found he had got a Gold Watch in his Pocket . I knew he never was capable of wearing such a Thing , so I ask 'd him how he came by it ? Phoo , says the Prisoner , I mason 'd a Cull , and the Fellow has advertised it ; but the Scoundrel was drunk , and did not know how much Money he lost . He advertised but 7 Guineas , and the Scoundrel lost more . She said the Scoundrel was drunk , and she mason 'd him , and stole the Watch and his Snuff-box out of his Pocket . As soon as I heard this , I bid them get out of my Room ; telling them I would harbour no Thieves ; and I went down to the Turn-key , and desired him to send for a Constable to secure them , telling him I had Thieves in my Room , and I had discovered Villany ; but there was none came , because Constables are afraid of being ill used in the Fleet . When I went up again into my Room , the Prisoner 's Husband ( who wore the Watch in his Pocket 2 Days ) fell down on his Knees , and begged I would not turn them out of my Room , nor expose them : But I insisted on their being gone , and turned them out by Force . Both the Prisoner and her Husband told me the very Day when the Watch was first advertised , - the 6th of February . Upon the Discovery of this Villany , I went down to the Coffee-House in the Fleet-Prison , and found the things advertised on the 6th of February , and that they were lost at a Pretended Attorney 's House ; so I wrote a Letter to be left at the Coffee-House mentioned in the Advertisement , and the next Day the Prosecutor came to the Coffee-House in the Fleet , and the Prisoner was taken up . The Day I discovered the Villany , she came to her Husband and said , I met the Scoundrel in Carey-street , by Lincoln's-Inn-Fields , with his Horse in his Hand ; and she described him and his Cloaths so well , that the Minute he came into the Coffee-House , I knew him and went up to the Table where he sat , and asked him if he had not lost a gold Watch ? Prisoner . Ask Mr Murden what I pawned on Saturday ? Murden . She came to her Husband , and said she had no Money ; and she went out . When she returned , she said she had pawned a Ring off her Finger . Mr Richardson . There was a Gold Watch offered to be pawn 'd at our House , ( I think ) by the Prisoner , but I ca n't be positive : I had seen her before , but I would not take it in , unless she could convince me she had a Property in it . She told me it belonged to a Gentleman of Ludgate , and upon my refusing it , she took it away again . Francis Jeal , Constable . When I took the Prisoner to Woodstreet-Counter , she cry 'd bitterly in the Lodge , and said that one Peter Hood , and Mrs Oldfield , ( the Prosecutor 's Mistress ) had part of the Money . Prisoner . This is the Woman which W - brought to our House . He was in her Company that Night , and 2 Nights following . Mary Oldfield . I never knew the Woman to be guilty of such Things : but I saw the Gentleman have his Watch and Snuff-box just before he went to Bed . In the Night he wanted a Pinch , and missing his Box , the Girl came up with a Candle , but he could find neither his Watch , nor his Box . I never saw the Prisoner till next Night , and then she came to the Sun Coffee-House , to bid me come Home , but I refused , and have never seen her since . The Prosecutor took me up , and kept me in the Counter , from Tuesday to Friday . Prisoner . They locked themselves in , and I called and asked them , what they 'd please to have for Breakfast . Oldfield . She did knock at the Door in the Morning , and the Gentleman bid me not say any thing for fear she should run away . Prisoner . Did not I stay at Home all that Night ? Oldfield . I am not a Judge of that . Prisoner . Had not I a Servant that went away that Night ? Oldfield . Yes ; and she run away with a camblet Gown of mine .

Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 175 . + Elizabeth Briggs alias Hollis , was indicted for privately stealing 2 Thirty-six Shilling-picces , a Moidore , 3 Guineas , a Half-Guinea , and 40 s. in Money , from the Person of Richard Kent , January 14 . Richard Kent . I live in Ely-Court in Holborn , and on the 14th of January , about 9 at Night , I was coming thro ' Titchburn-Court , which is about 300 Yards from the Place where I live , and being a little merry , ( it being Christmas Time ) I looked in at a Door which stood a little open , and saw 2 Women sitting by the Fire . They said 't was very cold Weather , and asked me to give them a hot Pint . I agreed to that , and when it was drank out , I was for going away , knowing I had a Charge of Money about me . But they took hold of my Cloaths , and said I should give them t'other hot Pint . Accordingly I agreed to it : but when that was out , I found myself in such a prodigious Disorder that I could not get up , nor go ; but the Gentlewoman at the Bar kept me from falling , by sitting in my Lap . I found she began to be busy with my Pockets , so I covered them , with the Flaps of my Coat . As soon as I came to myself , I went Home to put my Money up ; I had 8 l. 12 s. in one Pocket : 2 l. in Silver , in another ; and some more Silver in another . I had three Pockets with Money in them ; - but 't was all gone , and I had no more than Eighteen-pence left in all my Pockets . As to the Liquor I drank , had it been honestly brewed , I could have drank it all up myself and have been sober , but I believe there was Opium , or something put into it , which disordered me for about 15 Minutes , and during that Time I felt the Gentlewoman 's Hand in my Pocket . There was 3 of them in all , but no Utensils or Household-Goods in the House . Mary Woodcock . I saw the Prisoner put her Hand into Mr Kent 's Pocket , and pull out a handful of Money , - half Crowns and Shillings : but as for Gold , I saw none . This was taken out of his right Side-Pocket ; 't was done in the Kitchen , upon the Ground-Floor , and she was sitting upon his Knee , at the same Time . Furthermore , I made the Hot-pots ; and the Prisoner grated something into them , which got into my Head , I believe it was Opium , for I had like to have fallen off my Chair myself . I saw her hold the Gentleman 's Money in her Hand , but he and I were so disordered , that we took no notice of it . I am Landlady of the House , and one of my Lodgers brought the Prisoner in , for 2 or 3 Nights unknown to me . I am sure I saw her pull out the Money , and put it into her Pocket , and moreover , she paid me 9 s. in part of the Reckoning . She gave it me for the Hot-pots ; I did not take notice of above 2 or 3 Hot-pots , and the Price of a Hot-pot is but a Shilling , and moreover she gave me 6 s. and 6 d. besides , what it was for , I ca n't tell ; the first and second Hot-pot , was enough to turn my Head : whether the Reckoning came to 9 s. or not , I ca n't tell . There was more than 2 , or 3 , or 4 Hotpots , but the first two turned my Head so , that I ca n't tell where she put the Money when she had taken it ; but she took it openly and held it in her Hand , but whether she put it in her Bosom or Pocket , I know not , and to be sure she took it in a clandestine Manner , for I believe the Gentleman did not know it . Acquitted . 176 , 177 . + Catherine Robinson and Mary Hill were indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , val . 4 l. 10 s. from the Person of Alexander Grey , Jan. 14 . Alexander Grey . On the 14th of January , I came from Blackwall , and about 10 o'Clock at Night , I was coming up the Minories , and asked Robinson the Way to Aldgate . She asked me if I was not a Yorkshire Man , I told her yes , and that I came from Scarborough . She said , she came from Whitby , and after some Talk , she asked me to make her drink . I let her know I had no more than 5 d. in my Pocket , but I would give her a Pint of Beer , and accordingly we went in at Mr Goodchild 's , and while we were drinking , Hill came in . I was not above 10 Minutes in their Company , but in that Time Robinson picked the Watch out of my Pocket , either at the Door , or in the House , and then they both went off directly . On Thursday the 17th , ( between Eleven and Twelve at Noon ) I found the two Prisoners a-bed in their Lodgings , according to the Directions they gave me while I was drinking with them . They deny 'd the Fact , and I could not get a Constable , nor a Warrant for them , till the Monday following , and then their Landlady , an Irish Woman , told me they were gone over the Water . But in a Week 's Time ( the Monday following ) I got a Constable and took them , and they were a-bed together then likewise . Robinson got out of Bed , and hit me a good Slap in the Face , and ask 'd me whether I had the Impudence to charge her with taking my Watch ? But when we got them to the Door , she told me if I would give her something to drink , she would let me have it again . So I went in and treated them with a Bottle of Wine mull 'd ; and then she told me her Landlady had pawned it for a Guinea to the Man I bought it of ; tho ' when I went to enquire after it , I found it had been pawn 'd for 30 s. When they were before Justice Dennet , they confess 'd every Thing , and the Justice said he would be here , and bring their Confession . The Man they pawn 'd the Watch to is here : he has got it ; but I know it again , there 's E D in the inside Case , and was made by Freeman . This is the Watch ; and Hill confess 'd she had part of the Money it was pawn 'd for . Robinson . He gave me the Watch to raise Money , because he had none , and Hill carry 'd it to pawn . When she returned , he gave us half a Guinea a-piece . Gray . Upon my Oath I did not , I did not give it them to raise Money . I was told this would be the Story when I came here . I am positive Robinson was the Woman that took it , for the other was never near me . While we were drinking in the House , I pulled it out to see what o'Clock it was , after which I did not stay a Minute , but went to the Door and missed it immediately . Both Acquitted . 178.
