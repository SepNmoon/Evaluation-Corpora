 Other Murders admit of some Circumstances of Palliation , from Provocation , - sudden Rage , - false Notions of Honour , and the like ; but if the Man is guilty here , What Compassion can he be entitled to from you , who shewed none to his Fellow-Creatures . [ Sarah Bland sworn . ] Council . Pray did you know Mary Maurice ? Bland . Yes , she was the Wife of John Maurice . Q . Were you taken up at any Time ? tell us where , and when . Bland . Mary Maurice and I were taken up some Time in July , about a quarter of an Hour after Eleven at Night , and carried to St Martin 's Round-House . Q . What did Mr Bird do to you there ? Bland . We had not sat down more than the Space of four or five Minutes in the Fore-Room above Stairs , but Mr Bird came to me , and took me by the Shoulder , and bid me go down Stairs . Said he , Madam , go down these Stairs ; and Mary Maurice said to him , let me go along with my Cousin ; and she went along with me into the Hole . Q . How many People were there in the Hole , when you went down there ? Bland . There were about twelve or fourteen People . Q . How many more were put into the same Place ? Bland . There were in all about twenty-four . Bird . I ask Pardon for interrupting . I think the Question asked , is , What Time they were put down into the Hole , for my Life depends upon it . Bland . It was about a quarter of an Hour after Eleven ; and we were kept there till Ten in the Morning ; I was vastly hot , and cried out Murder ; and so did almost every Body that was there ? Q . What Time was it you found it so hot ? Bland . About one o'Clock ; and it was very hot about four o'Clock . I begged for some Water , but Mr Bird made no Answer to that . That Man was there , I believe he was the Beadle , and Mr Bird said he could not stand to talk there . Bird . Please to take Notice , there was an Answer made her by the Beadle . Court . No , she does not say any such thing . Bland . I begged for a little Air , and in order to get some , I told Mr Bird there was a Woman in Labour , and that some were in Fits , and that there were two a dying . Q . What did he say to that ? Bland . He said they might die and be damned . Bird . What Hour was that ? Bland . I believe it was not five o'Clock in the Morning . Court . What State of Health was Mary Maurice in , when she went down into the Hole ? Bland . She was very well then ; but about four or five o'Clock , she was very light-headed , and said to me , Cousin , let me die , let me die , for God 's Sake . She laid her Head upon my Lap for some Time ; and her Head dropped off my Lap , she sunk down and I saw her no more afterwards , I was in a Fit myself . There was a Woman came with a Quartern of Gin to some Prisoner there , but I can not tell who it was for . Q . What Time was this ? Bland . It was before the Hole was shut up , I believe it was before five o'Clock in the Morning . That the Woman came to the Grate ; she had a Quartern-Pot in her Hand ; she said there was Gin in the Pot , and that she was going to give it to one of the Prisoners ; and Mr Bird , by Force , shoved her away , spilt the Liquor , and broke the Glass . - He called her Bitch , and bid her get away from the Window , so the Woman went away and I never saw her afterwards . Soon after Mr Bird came with a Padlock and padlock 'd the Window himself . - It is a Shutter with Iron Bars a-cross , and long Holes cut in it , to let the Light through . Q . Was it opened before the Watchman broke it open about ten o'Clock in the Morning ? Bland . I do not know that . Q . What further do you know of this Matter ? Bland . There was Murder and Fire called ; there was a Woman brought a Pipe , such as People smoak Tobacco in , and went to the Ale-House and got some Beer , and poured it into the Bowl of the Pipe , and we sucked it through the small End of the Pipe , which was put through the Holes of the Shutter , and some Body came and pushed the Woman and broke the Pipe , so we could not get any more . Q . You say there was a cry of Murder and Fire , what did no Body come to your Assistance ? Bland . No , no Body . There were four or five in Fits in the Hole , but it being dark I could not tell who were dead and who were alive . Court . Mr Bird , if you have any Questions to propose to this Witness ask them . Bird . Please to ask her what Time in the Morning her Kinswoman died , with her Head in her Lap . Court . She did not say she died with her Head in her Lap . Bird . I will venture to say she said her Head was in her Lap about two or three o'Clock , and then she died . Bland . She said , let me lay my Head in your Lap and let me die ; but I do not know when she died . Bird . Sir John , I am more afraid of my Reputation than I am of my Life . - Ask her whether she has not made Oath that Mary Maurice died between two and three o'Clock . Bland . I never did declare any such Thing . Bird . Ask her whether the Door or Shutter was shut to murder these People , or only to keep them from being drunk , in order to be carried before that Gentleman [ Colonel Deveil ] to answer the High-Constable . Bland . To be sure he could not be off of knowing our Distress , for he said , Die and be damned ; and there was room enough in the House ; whether he heard any Complaint or Cry of Murder , or their being afraid of losing their Lives , whether he heard my Voice , or made any Repartee to it , I can not tell ; but I heard his Voice , and saw him come down several Times with Prisoners . Bird . Did you ever know me to be such a cruel wicked Dog , as to kill five or six of your Sex ? Bland . No , I can not say that . Bird . I should be a cruel Dog if I had . Bland . He might have relieved us , for there was Room in the House ; there was an old Woman who gave him Six-pence not to be locked down with us , what her Name is I can not tell . Q . How many Rooms were there ? Bland . There were three Rooms in all , that I saw ; there is another Hole besides this , for the Men . Jury . Were those Rooms full ? Bland . They were not full . There were some that paid for their Beds ? Bird . Who paid for their Beds ? Bland . I do not know who they were . Bird . Do you know of one Amey 's striking and assaulting me , and knocking my Candle out of my Hand ? Speak plainly , speak the Truth . Bland . This Elizabeth Amey , insisted on going up Stairs to pay her Reckoning , and Mr Bird gave her a Push and her Cap came off : I did not see any Body strike him ; nor do I know any thing of the Candle 's being knocked out . - You had a Candle in your Hand . Bird . Was I drunk or sober ? Bland . I do not know . Bird . I happen 'd to be entirely sober that Night . Q . You say Mary Maurice went down of her own accord ; did she desire to come back again ? Bland . Yes she did ; and she cried out for Air and for Water . Q . Was she brought in by any Officer ? Bland . She was brought in along with me . Q . What Time did she desire to be let out ? Bland . I believe it was between three and four o'Clock in the Morning . Q . Do you know of whom she asked to be let out ? Bland . She ask 'd Mr Bird , anso did a great many more besides her ; and when Mr Bird came down with more Prisoners , she said , For God 's sake , Mr Bird , let us have some Air or some Water to relieve us , or take some of us away , and put us in another Place . Q . What did he say then ? Bland . He said he would give us no relief at all - he did say so indeed , I am sure he said so . Q . What House was you and Maurice brought from ? Bland . No House at all , we were taken up by the Porto Bello , just by the Round-House . Q . What sort of a Woman was Mary Maurice , was she short or tall , fat or slender ? Bland . She was of a middling Size , a little inclinable to be Dropsical . Q . Who put you into the Hole ? Bland . I am certain Mr Bird was the Person who had the Key , opened the Door , and put us down ; he took me by the Shoulder and shoved me down Stairs . Q. Robert Churchman , Do you know a place called the Hole belonging to St Martin 's Round-House ? Churchman . I am a Carpenter ; I was sent for to measure it ; you go up four Stone Steps into the Round-House , and this Place is below these Steps : The Height of it is six Foot two Inches ; the Length and Breadth six Foot six , by six Foot two ; the Window is two Foot six , by one Foot six ; there are some Iron Bars , but no Glass , there is a Shurter which puts up with three Slits , about a Quarter of an Inch wide , and about 18 Inches long ( but I never measured it ) ; there is a Door to the Passage leading to the Hole , and opens into the Hole , two Foot wide , the Door does not go up to the Top by nine Inches or there abouts , and there is another Room for the Men which is eight Foot five , by six Foot three , and there is a Passage nine Foot three by four Foot ten , which leads from the Women 's Hole to the Men 's Hole ; and there is a Door at the Head of the Stairs . - If the Hole had been left open the Prisoners would have been secure by the Door at the Top of the Stairs , but then the Men and the Women might have gone to o another , which is not customary . [ Robert Bus hel , Beadle of St. Martin 's , sworn . ] Q . Do you remember the Time that a Number of Women were brought into the Round-House ? Bushel . Yes ; it was the 16th Day of July last . Q . Do you know what Time any of them began to be brought in ? Bushel . They began to be brought in about eleven o'Clock , and none were brought in after four . Q . Do you know what Time the Deceased Mary Maurice or Sarah Bland were brought in ? Bushel . No ! there were so many of them that I can not tell their Names . - I was there all Night . Q . Do you know how many People were put into the Hole that Night ? Bushel . I believe there was about twenty People in all ? Q . Do you remember three Women being put down into the Hole ? Bushel . I was ordered to put three Women into the Hole by the Prisoner at the Bar , it was about five o'Clock in the Morning , before the Constable went away . I opened the Door of the Hole , and saw the Hole was so full that I did not think it reasonable to put any more in : - There is no Lock to it , only two Bolts . Q . What Condition were the People in then ? Bushel . They seemed to be pretty much crowded , but did not cry out : said I to Mr. Bird , if you put them in you will stifle them ; but if you bolt the upper Door , and open the Door of the Hole , there will be room enough for them : Mr Bird ran down pretty hastily , and put them in ; and when he came up again , he said , Bushel , I have put them in in a Minute , though you would not put them in . Q . Did you think there was any Danger in doing it ? Bushel . I did it out of Compassion to these poor Creatures . Jury . Did you hear any of these poor Creatures cry out for Help ? Bushel . No , I did not indeed ; I did not hear any Outcry all Night , and I staid till five o'Clock , though four was our Hour to go away . Q . Did you hear any cry of Murder ? Bushel . No , I did not , and if there had been any , I must have heard it . Jury . Did Mr. Bird sit with you . Bushel . Mr. Bird was pretty much at that End of the Table all the Night . Q . Did the Prisoner make any Answer when you said they would be stifled . Bushel . He did not make any Answer . Bird . My going down then was not to put People in , but to see that they were safe . Bushel . The Constable of the Night and I went away just about five o'Clock ; and just before we went away , he went down three or four Steps ; he did not go into the Hole nor into the Passage , but followed Mr. Bird , with his long Staff in his Hand , and Bird went quite down ; for that was the Time they were put in . Q . When you went down , what Sort of Air was there in the Place ? Bushel . There was a little wooden Door opened on the outside of the Round-House next the Street , and that was opened by the Constable 's Order before we went away . - There is a Common-Sewer always runs under it . Bird . I beg the Favour of you to ask him , whether at the Time of my going down , it was not the Care of the Constable ; whether it was not at the Constable 's Request ; and whether I did not say upon the Stairs , What do you bring them down for ? I have more than I know what to do with already . And whether Mr. Akins [ the Constable ] did not say , I will have my House cleared ? Bushel . I can not say I heard any such Thing . Q . If the Constable had ordered any such thing , must you not have heard it ? Bushel . I think I must . Elizabeth Surridge . I was carried to St. Martin 's Round-House , between twelve and one , and I staid drinking till about three o'Clock in the Watch-House , up Stairs ; then I happened to fall a-sleep by the Fire Side , and Mr. Bird came to me , and said , Come , you Bitch , you shall not sleep here : And then he put me and two other Women into the Hole . - Mr Bird himself put us down . Q . In what Condition did you find the Place , when you came into it ? Surridge . It was very hot ; not fit for so many People to be there . Q . Was there any Stench there ? Surridge . Yes , there was the Stench of a Necessary-House . - The Door was fastened presently after we were put in . Q . Did you make any outcries ? Surridge . We desired not to have so many People in the Place ; before Mary Wood came down , some of the Prisoners joined to get a Dram ; there was a poor Woman brought it in a Bottle , and Bird 's Son said , You will all get drunk before Morning , and shut the Window up , to prevent our having a Dram , but he opened it himself again , in about ten Minutes ; and it was not a quarter of an Hour before it was shut again . Mr. Bird shut it his own self ; he padlocked the Window , and said , Now , you Bitches , you shall not have the Window opened , but die and be damned ; and the Window was not opened afterwards , till about ten in the Morning . - This was about six o'Clock . - Some of us sat in our Shifts , one Woman sat naked ; for it was so hot , I thought I could not live . We cried out Murder and Fire , and told him there were People in Labour , for there were two Women big with Child . I beat with my Shoe against the Wainscote , and all this would not do , no Body came to us . - I did not see Mr. Bird after he shut the Window up . St. Martin 's Clock had struck ten before the Window was opened . I thought every Minute an Hour . Then a Watchman came and opened the Window . I took hold of a Woman 's Arm that was dead ; said I , Here is one Woman dead , and the rest are a-dying , and they took no Notice of that ; but Mr Bird hurried us before the Justice . When I came out of the Place , I drank a Pint of dirty Water myself , and said , For God Almighty 's Sake , to Mrs. Bird , give me a little Water , for I am almost perished , and at last she gave me a Pint of fresh Water . Q . Who was it that was dead ? Surridge . I can not tell , I did not know any of them . Q . How many were there dead ? Surridge . Three I can swear to , if not four , - they lay all along , they did not speak . Q . How do you know they were dead ? Surridge . One of them was Stone-dead , her Face was as black as my Shoe , and the others looked as if they were dead or dying . I said to the People above , that one of the Women was dead , and the rest were a-dying . Q . Who did you beg Water of ? Surridge . We begged it of People on the outside of the Window , going by . I sent to my Landlady , and she came and offered Money for Mary Wood and me to go out of the Hole ; and they said they could not let any Body out , for Mr. Bird was in Bed . We sent for a couple of Pipes , and the People put the small End of the Pipes through the Shutter , and Mary Wood and I sucked Water through the Pipes . Q . Did any Body else suck Water out of the Pipes ? Surridge . No . Bird . Look at me , the Law says the Accuser and the Accused shall look Face to Face . [ She turned her Face towards him . ] Q . How many People were there in the Hole ? Surridge . There were about twenty People . Q . How many People will the Place conveniently hold ? Surridge . I believe about eight or nine . Q . Was there not room enough for a great many People in that Room where you staid till three o'Clock in the Morning ? Surridge . There was room enough for a great many more than were there , and there were People that I could hear walking over Head that were Prisoners ; they might have brought a great many Prisoners out of the Hole , and have put them into other Rooms . Q . Would the Passage between the two Holes hold a great many People ? Surridge . I believe it would hold about seven or eight , and if we had had Liberty of being upon the Stairs , I believe none of us would have been dead . Bird . I would ask her whether I came in a tyrannical Manner ; or only in Subserviency to the Constable ? Did not Mr. Bushel go down with me ? Surridge . No indeed he did not . Jury . Please to ask the Woman whether she heard of any Body 's beating the Candle out of Mr Bird 's Hand ? Surridge . I did not hear any thing of that . [ Mr Churchman called again . ] Q. Mr Churchman , you have measured this Room ; how many Persons will this Room contain , to have reasonable Room without doing them a Prejudice , or their being in danger of their Lives . Churchman . I believe there is room for twenty People if there was Air let into it , for there are Benches all round for them to sit on . Bird . I desire this Question to be asked her ; whether about five o'Clock , when you went down , there was not a singing or hallowing ? Surridge . There was a Noise of People 's talking . Q . Was there any Rejoicing ? Surridge . It was not a Place to rejoice in , there was no singing that I know of . Bird . Ask Mr. Bushel if he did not hear singing there ? Bushel . I did not hear any singing , nor any crying out , and I sat where if there had been a cry of any Thing I must have heard it . Jury . Mr. Bushel , is he reckoned a cruel Man to his Prisoners , or does he treat them with Humanity ? Bushel . He is reckoned to be pretty hasty . Bird . Answer the Question plainly , am I reckoned cruel ? Court . A merciful Man may be hasty , is he cruel or humane ? Bushel . He is pretty cruel , my Lord . Q. Mary Cosier , Were you one of the unhappy Persons who were taken up the 15th or 16th of July ? Cosier . I was taken up the 15th between eleven and twelve at Night . Q . What Place were you carried to ? Cosier . To the Watch-House in St. Martin 's . Q . What Room were you put into ? Cosier . I was put into the Hole directly . Q . Who put you down ? Cosier . The Man of the Watch-House . Q . Look round and see whether you know the Person that put you down ? Cosier . It was that Man , the Man with a Paper in his Hand , [ That was the Prisoner at the Bar . ] Q . How many People do you reckon were there when you were first put in ? Cosier . I can not say exactly - there might be about twenty People ; the Place was almost full . Jury . You say it was almost full ; how near was it being full ? Cosier . I can not say how many more it would hold , for I think the Place was full when I went down , but they crowded in more afterwards till four o'Clock in the Morning - It was so dark I could not well tell how many were there ; but in the whole I believe there were twenty-seven or twenty-eight . Q . Was there any Complaint of Heat in the Place ? Cosier . Yes , and we cried out Fire , Murder , for Christ 's Sake let us have Water ; for the Lord 's Sake a little Water , for we are stifled with Heat ; I would have given four Shillings for a Gallon of Water . Q . Did you say so to any Body that came down Stairs from the Round-House ? Cosier . I can not say that ; we cried out as loud as we could cry out ; when the Window was open a Woman came and brought her Sister-in-Law a Quartern of Gin , and Bird 's Son told his Father ; and Bird came out and pushed her down , and shut up the Window of the Hole himself , and said they should have nothing at all . Q . Did you hear him say so ? Cosier . Yes , I did . - It was between four and five o'Clock in the Morning , and the Window was shut up from that Time till a quarter of an Hour after Ten - it was that Time when I went out . Q . How were you forced to sit ? Cosier . We were very much crowded , I never have been my self * since : My Thighs were so black I could not tell what to do with them ; this Handkerchief was as stiff as Buckram , with Sweat from the Heat of the Place . * The Witness appeared to be in a weak Condition , and soon after she had given her Evidence fainted away . Jury . When there was a Quartern of Gin brought to the Window , I desire to know whether she apprehended , that Bird shut up the Window to prevent the bringing them more Gin , or maliciously to do them a Prejudice ? Cosier . I can not tell that . Q . Were any of the poor Creatures in Fits ? Cosier . In the Time I was there , there were four or five in Fits , from the Heat of the Place ; but Ann Branch , the little crooked Body in the red Cloak , died on this Side of me , about seven o'Clock in the Morning . I held her up as long as I cou 'd , for I was very weak myself . Q . Were there any People lying dead upon the Ground ? Cosier . Yes : But I did not know they were dead ; for I strove to awake them , thinking they were a sleep : I was the last that came out alive but three , and I shook two of them to awake them . Q . How many were found dead when you were let out ? Cosier . Four , Sir . Q . If that Door had been open that leads to the Stairs , would there have been room enough for you ? Cosier . Yes , I believe there would ; I would have given a Shilling for a little Air for half an Hour ; about three or four o'Clock in the Morning , one of the Women in the Hole would have given him a Shilling for a Pint of Wine . - She would have given Mr. Bird a Shilling to speak to him , or drink a Pint of Wine with him : He said , Damn you , you Bitch , for your Sake , all shall suffer ; then I made Answer , and said , it is hard that all must suffer for one . What Answer he made to that I can not tell . Q . How do you know it was him ? Cosier . Because it was at the Time he brought that Woman down , and he had a Candle in his Hand . Bird . Do not look one upon another , look at that Gentleman . Q . Did any Body strike that Candle out of his Hand , or put it out ? Cosier . No Body , Sir . Q . Was the Candle put out ? Cosier . No , Sir . Q . Have you seen that Woman lately , that would have given him a Shilling ? Cosier . I saw her just now , but I do not know her Name . [ An Officer with a Person named by the Prisoner , were sent with this Witness , for her to bring from among the other Evidences the Woman who offer 'd Bird the Shilling , and she returned with Elizabeth Amey . ] Bird . Who were you brought by ? for I do not find your Name here [ A Paper in his Hand . ] Cosier . I was brought by two Watchmen . Bird . Was any Body brought with you ? Cosier . No , I was brought by myself . - I was at the Cook 's Shop . Bird . There were none came in singly , but were brought in two and three at a Time . Q . How were you when you came out of the Hole ? Cosier . I was so thirsty by the Confinement , and Heat of the Place , that I drank four Pints of dirty Water , and then I drank all the Water out of a Tea Kettle which stood in the Corner of the Place ; I do not know whether that was clean Water or not ; a Gentleman brought three Pails of Water , and I drank three Quarts of that , but I brought it up again . Q. Elizabeth Amey , Were you taken up at any Time and carried to the Round-House ? Amey . I was taken up about twelve o'Clock at Night ; I do not know the Day of the Month ; we went up Stairs , and staid there till between two and three in the Morning , we drank three or four Pots of Beer , and some Shrub ; I went down into the Hole on my Occasions : Bird followed me down ; pulled my Cap off , and beat me with a Key : I cried and screamed , and desired to go up and pay my Reckoning , and he said I should not ; the Air , on opening the Door , was as that of an Oven : I complain 'd of Drought ; and he said we might all stay there and be damned , for he would not let us out ; - he said something of Bitches . Bird . Look at me , Mrs. Amey , see if you know me . Amey . I do ; I know you to be the Person who pulled my Cap off , and beat me with a Key ; and said , Die and be damned , that was too good for us . I bid a Shilling for a Quart of Water , and four Shillings for a Gallon of Water , and he would give us none . Q . Who bid the Money ? Amey . I did myself . Q . What Time was this ? Amey . It was about four o'Clock . Q . Who shut the Window up ? Amey . Mr. Bird himself shut up the Window , upon the Account of a Quartern of Gin that was brought there , and the Window was never opened any more . Q . When the Window was shut up , did he make use of any Expression that you might die and be damned ? Amey . He said he would not open the Window , for we should all get drunk with Gin , and we might die and be damned : I myself offered him a Shilling for a Pint of Wine , if he would let me go up Stairs again ; and he said I should have nothing , for I was an insolent saucy Bitch . Q . Were there any great Outcries ? Amey . Yes : there were Cries as of People in Labour . Q . Did he hear them ? Amey . He knows very well it was so . Bird . Ask her what Time the Window was shut up ? Amey . It was about five o'Clock . Bird . She says it was about five o'Clock , when the Window was shut up : Ask her whether there was any Body there besides me that could hear their Complaints . Amey . No Body but his Son , I believe ; his Son said we were a pack of Bitches , and wanted Gin , and be damned . Jury . Was there room above Stairs for many more People ? Amey . There was room for a great many more , and in the Hole I really believe there were four or five and Twenty when I went in , and four were brought after : And Mr. Bushel said to Mr. Bird ; you had better open the Door , and then there will be room for them , and Mr. Bird said , Damn them , let them make room . Bird . Did not you assault me and beat the Candle out of my Hand . Amey . I did not beat the Candle out of his Hand , nor blow it out . Bird . Did any Body else do it ? Amey . No , no Body else . [ John Leathes sworn . ] Q . Were you at the Round-House on the 16th of July . Leathes . I was going by the Round-House between one and two in the Morning , ( I do not know whether it was the 16th or not ) and hearing there were a great many People taken up , I went in : Mr Bird , the Prisoner at the Bar , was there . Q . Was you down with the Women there ? Leathes . Yes , I went out of Curiosity to see what Girls were there ; for I did not know ; but I might know some of them . Q . Are you sure Bird went down ? Leathes . I am positively'sure he was down ; I desired him to let me go down , which he did ; but there was none of the Girls I saw , that I knew ; they were dirty Creatures . Q . Did not you tell Bird you had a mind to satisfy your Curiosity ? Leathes . Yes , and I said I would give him a Pint of Beer ; and he said stay a little and he would ; and he went down with three Prisoners , and I went along with them . Q . Was there any Stench in the Place ? Leathes . Yes , a very great one ; and not being used to such Smells , I thought I should have been suffocated , for I believe if I had staid there five Minutes , I should have dropped down ; I told him the Danger these poor unhappy Creatures were in , and that if he put any more in , or let them stay there till Morning , they would be dead ; and he said , Let them die and be damned . Q . Was the Room crowded , or how many might be in it ? Leathes . The Room was very full , but I did not tell the Number of People , for I did not care to stay there long . Q . Did you hear any Complaints or Cries ? Leathes . I heard a Moaning while I was down , as if some Body was dying : This was between two and three o'Clock . I did not go down at first when I came in ; for I waited Mr. Bird 's Leisure . Q . During the Time you were there , did you hear any Cries of Mur der or Fire , or want of Water ? Leathes . No , I did not ; nor nothing particular , only he was abusing the Prisoners ; cursing one and damning another , and laying out the Law in an arbitrary Manner . Q . When you were below and heard that low Tone of a Voice , did you ask the Reason of it ? Leathes . No , I did not : I thought some Body might be sick or melancholy . Q . Did you hear them ask for Water ? Leathes . I heard some of them ask for Water , and one ask 'd for Gin . [ Robert Burns , a Soldier , sworn . ] Q . Were you at the Round-House that Night there was such a Number of People put in there ? Burns . Yes : I was put into the Round-House about one o'Clock in the Morning . I drank and smoak 'd with Mr. Bird for about three Hours ; and after I had spent my Money , I was put down into the Hole , into the Mens Hole . Q . How many were there ? Burns . About eight or nine Men . It is just adjoining to the Place where the Women were . Q . How long did you stay in the Hole ? Burns . I staid from four o'Clock in the Morning till about a quarter after Ten . Q . How much Money did you spend there ? Burns . I think it was two or three Shillings , I am not certain . Q . Was that all the Money you had ? Burns . No , I had a Matter of three Guineas and an half in my Pocket . Q . In whose Company were you ? Burns . There was Mr. Bird , and I think the Constable of the Night . Q . Was there any Complaints or Cries ? Burns . While I was there , the Women were quarrelling , and making a great deal of Noise ; and they were laughing above Stairs ; I heard two or three of them were dead . Q . Who shut the Windows ? Burns . I do not know who shut them . I offered half a Crown several Times to have the Light kept open , which was shut before five . The Women called out Murder , enough to frighten any Christian to hear them . You might have heard them from that Place , almost to Charing-Cross . They called out for Air and Water ; and I believe if they had staid there ten Minutes longer , that every Soul of them would have been dead , for they were half of them almost dead when they came out . The Smell was enough to knock one down . I was almost suffocated myself . One of them came up as naked as she was born , - two of them were dead before six o'Clock . While I was above Stairs with Mr. Bird , and smoaking my Pipe , I heard them cry out . Q . Did you know what they said ? Burns . I did not take any Notice of it then . Bird . I think you are a Man of Honour and a Christian ; What Time did you go down into the Hole , and who put you there ? Burns . It was about four o'Clock in the Morning , and it was by your Order . Bird . I had nothing to do with it ; was not you drove down Stairs headlong , and your Hat knocked off ? Burns . Yes , I was thrown down Stairs , but it was by your Order . Bird . I did not say any thing of the Serjeant 's being sent down . I said if I can get those drunken Fellows down Stairs , you shall all come up again . Burns . He did not say any such Thing . You told me , you House-keepers maintained us , and such Stuff as that . Bird . That was when we were talking about military Affairs . Court . Do you think he was in Liquor ? Burns . Yes , I am sure he was , for he drank a great deal along with me . Bird . I did not put him down . Edward Kelk . I live in the King 's Mews , next Door to the Round-House . Q . Do you know any thing of any Cries there , the sixteenth of July in the Morning ? Kelk . I can not say as to the Day of the Month , because I did not set it down ; nor whether it was Morning or not , because I went to Bed at nine o'Clock . I know nothing against the Man . I can not say I heard much crying out that Night , I have heard more Noise some other Nights . I heard a Noise ; they were making Orations , but whether they were rejoicing , or what it was , I could not distinguish . Q . Did you hear any Thing of Murder or Fire cried out ? Kelk . I did not hear any Thing of Murder or Fire cried out . Q. George Colclough , What Business are you of ? Colclough . I am a Barber , Perriwig-Maker , and Surgeon . Q . Were you sent for to bleed any Body at St. Martin 's Round-House ? Colclough . Yes ; on the 16th of July , at half an Hour after ten , or about eleven in the Morning , I was sent for ; the Person that came , said , For God 's Sake , Mr. Colclough , come and bleed one who is very ill ; I went to the Round-House ; when I went down the Stairs , I saw a young Woman lying upon the Ground . I blooded them first who were in the most Danger . One Mr. Perkins was there , said he , Mr. Colclough , shall I come to your Assistance ? I said , there is need enough of it , so he assisted me . There was one of the Women , I believe , had been dead two Hours . When I came to this Woman that I saw first , she was got up to the Ground-Floor . I blooded her , sent for a Chair , and put her into it , and gave her Wine and Water . Then I went and blooded another Woman at the Plough-Door , in the Street , and took others to the Workhouse ; and one of those in the Work-house was two Days before she spake to me ; one was quite dead when I went in , another was near expiring , and two more died . Q . What do you think to be the Occasion of their Death ? Colclough . They were suffocated with Heat , and smothered . Q . Did you know Mary Maurice ? Colclough . I knew none of them by their Names . - The Heat was enough to kill me , I could hardly hear it . I was wet quite through my Coat , Waistcoat , Shirt , and all , so that I thought I should have died ; and I was not there above a Quarter of an Hour : but I thought it my Duty to do what Service I could to my Fellow-Creatures . Court . How many do you think this Room would contain conveniently ? Colclough . I should think eight enough . Q . But suppose twenty Persons were to be confined in this Room for an Hour , what would be the Consequence of that ? Colclough . I think , if I was to be confined there an Hour , I must inevitably die . Q . Do you think if twenty Persons were to be confined in this Place for an Hour together , it would manifestly endanger their Lives ? Colclough . I should think I might live when I came to a little Air . Court . I wish you would attend to a Question when you are upon your Oath : Do you think if twenty People were confined there for an Hour , they would not be in manifest Danger of their Lives ? Colclough . I think they must be in manifest Danger . Court . Now you answer the Question . Bird . I desire to know who sent for him , for it was I that sent . Colclough . It was Broadbent the Beadle that came for me ; I can not tell who sent him . I saw Mr. Bird very busy a writing , and his Wife vastly concerned . Bird . Did you see any Thing in my Behaviour that was bad ? Colclough . No : Nothing in particular . Bird . Did not I send for the Chair . Colclough . When I asked for the Chair , Bird said he would send for it , but the Chair never came . Q . What Chair is that ? Colclough . The Work-house Chair ; and it did not come till I sent for it a second Time . Bird . I can prove it came immediately , as soon as the proper Person was sent for it . [ John Perkins , Surgeon , sworn . ] Q . Did you see any Woman that died in the Round-House , the 16th Day of July in the Morning . Perkins . On the 16th of July , about 11 o'Clock in the Morning , I was sent for to these unfortunate People . When I came to the Round-House , I saw a Woman in Convulsions . I blooded her . She bled very slow , and was dying ; and I think she died in about half an Hour or an Hour . I was told , there were more of these unfortunate People that wanted my Assistance . There were three more in Convulsions in the Hole : One Woman my Servant bled , another Mr. Colclough bled . I gave proper Orders for these People what to take . I was afraid they would have died , but Nature helped , and with a little Assistance they recovered . There were four of them dead in the Bone-House of St. Martin 's Church-yard . Q . As you are a Surgeon , you can give us your Opinion : What do you think to be the Occasion of their Deaths ? Perkins . I believe they were suffocated for want of a due Quantity of Air : Their Faces were bloated , and the Blood was stagnated ; I looked as far as their Breasts , and they were black , and they were so down to their Fingers Ends . Q . What Colour were their Faces of ? Perkins . Not quite black , but of a livid Colour . Q . Is that the common Appearance that Persons have who are suffocated for want of a due Quantity of Air ? Perkins . Generally , I believe ; but there are some Persons who die a natural Death , that are a little livid . - I was not down in the Hole , but I was willing to do the best I could for the Service of those poor Creatures who were alive , that they said were dying . Council . In order to ascertain that Mary Maurice was one of the Persons who died in the Hole , I would ask Bland what Clothes she had on . Q . What Clothes had Mary Maurice on ? Sarah Bland . She had a black Petticoat , and a white Gown like a Bed-gown , it was a long Gown . [ Elizabeth Surridge called again . ] Q . Did you take any Notice of any body that lay dead in the Hole ? Surridge . When I went down for my Handkerchief , I saw them all lying there ; and the Woman that I saw in the Bone-house , was the same that I saw in the Hole ; she had a whitish Gown , and a black Petticoat . John Maurice .
