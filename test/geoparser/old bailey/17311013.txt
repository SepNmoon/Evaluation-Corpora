Some other Evidences were call 'd , who confirm 'd the finding of the Things in the Prisoner 's Trunk , & c. The Prisoner in her Defence said , That some of the Things were her own that she had brought out of the Country with her ; and call 'd several Persons to her Character , and who had often heard the Character her Lady the Prosecutor her self had given her , till the last of her coming away ; and depos 'd several Things which made it probable that the Difference might arise between the Prisoner and Prosecutor upon account of a pressing Demand for Wages ; which as was made appear , did amount to near 40 l. several other Circumstances were depos 'd , that made it seen , that the Prosecutor had not a Foundation sufficient to convict the Prisoner , whereupon the Jury acquitted her .

Philip Favour depos 'd , That he went with the Prisoner before the Commissioners of Warehouses , where he owned he did take the Wrapper , and begg 'd forgiveness . The Prisoner did at the Bar deny his having taken the Piece of Wrapper , nor knew how it came to the place at the Alehouse , where Benjamin Workman found it ; unless he brought it and throw 'd it there himself , he owing him a Spite : He also pleaded , That it was a common Custom , and allow 'd the Labourers in the Warehouse , to take now and then a Remnant of Wrappers , as a Perquisite . And added , that Mr. Workman himself had employed him , to carry out Wrappers for him ; that it had been practised , and was allow 'd to take the Quantity of a Couple of Yards , for an Apron , or Night-Cap , or so ; but this Allowance being found to be abus 'd , there had been an Order made to the contrary , by the Commissioners of Warehouses ; which Order had been printed , and hung up in the Warehouses ; but there never was any Allowance for the taking whole Peices , or such Quantities : And he added that it had been found out , that 30000 Yards had been lost to the Company , the last Sale .

Witness my Hand . Octob . 1 . 1730. JOHN FREEMAN . Note , The said John Freeman is removed at , or near Chyrurgeon 's Hall , Silver-street . N. B . The aforesaid JOHN MOORE , has lately prepared two Anti-scorbutick Medicines , being Pills and a Spirit , which excel any Thing yet offer 'd to the Publick , with a Purge given at proper Times with it : It expels the numerous Trains of scorbutick Symptoms ; and as the Hypochondriac and Hysteric Illnesses have their Source from the Scurvy , it relieves them ; it alters and changes all the Juices in the Human Body ; thins the Leutor , viz . that fray , viscid , congulated Part of the Blood , which obstructs the Capillary Vessels , and is the Cause of Chilness in the extream Parts , as well as Heat in Hypochondriac and Hysteric Paroxysms , renovates the Blood , restores decay 'd Nature , chears the Heart , revives the Spirits , and opens Obstructions of the Viscera ; gives Rest to weary , tired , and worn out Bodies ; it invigerates and inkindles again the almost extinguished , natural innate Heat , making the vital Flame to burn clear , removing Weaknesses and Indispositions , and restoring the pristine Health . The Symptoms are , cutaneous Eruptions , as red , yellow , or black Spots upon the Arms and Legs , as small as Flea-bites , sometimes as large as a Grown-piece , and sometimes the Limbs are beset with rough , scaly Swellings ; os there is an itching of the Skin , which is frequently taken for what is vulgarly call 'd the Itch . The Scurvy perverts the Lymphs , and is a mortal Enemy to the nervous System , for Scorbutick Persons are troubled with Weariness , Sense of Weight , and a dull obscure Pain in the Limbs , the Appetite is either too stimulating or languid , the Gums are liable to Excrescence , Swellings and Ulcers , and when rubb 'd void either a saltish Blood , or serous Humour ; the Teeth are loose and corroded , the Mouth has a Stench ; the Spittle is very salt and sometimes acid ; they are likewise affected with nocturnal Sweats , difficulty of Breathing , wandering Pains , a fat Skin is found sometimes swimming on the Top of the Urine ; but all these Symptoms are rarely found in the same Person .
