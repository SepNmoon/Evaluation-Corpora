Francis Brooks . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury ! I live in Thames-street against the Custom-house , and keep a publick House . The Prisoner came to my House the 1st of Nov. in the Morning , before I came down from my Chamber , he asked for me as readily as if he had known me . When I came to him , he bid me - Good-Morrow , and asked me if I knew him ? I told him no . I know you , says he , and the last Time I was with you , I drank half a pint of Wine with you . I said , I did not remember it , and I went away from him , but he followed me , and requested I would drink half a pint with him now . I told him I was not well , and Wine was like Physic to me ; but he insisted upon my drinking with him , and called for half a pint of mulled Wine and a Toast , telling me it would do me no Harm . While we were drinking , he told me that one Hall , who belongs to the Custom-house , brought him acquainted with me . We sent for Mr. Hall , and he came to us , and the Prisoner told him he was Master of a Yarmouth Vessel now ; that he had had the Misfortune to have been concerned in the Smuggling Way , but thro ' the Interest of a Gentleman he got off , and now he was to live honestly . Then he told me he had run from Yarmouth to the Pool with his Vessel in 30 Hours , ( which was an extraordinary Run ) and that he was a little drowsy , and he wished I would let him lie down upon a Bed , and if my Cabbin-Coy comes to ask for me , bid him stay . The Prisoner being well drest , I call 'd my Maid Patience , and bid her go up Stairs , and lock my Door , and the Lodger 's Doors , and then lay such a Bed straight for the Master of the Ship to lie down . When she had done as I ordered , and had given me the Keys , I sent John Burges to shew the Prisoner the Bed on which he was to lie down , 't was up 3 pair of Stairs , but the Goods that I lost were in a Cupboard in my Chamber up 2 pair of Stairs . He staid but a very little while above , not a quarter of an hour , when he came down he told me he had been restless , and I believe that was true enough , for he had been at Work all the Time . I missed the Things in about a quarter of an Hour after he was gone , and found the Cupboard in my Chamber broke . I had put Money in it while he was in the House , but it was taken away , and a Silver Watch , and 2 mourning Rings , one of which had 2 Sparks on each side of the Cypher . He took likewise three Notes of Hand for about 25 l. these he owned he flung away . The Money I lost amounts to much about 9 l. I no sooner found I was robb 'd but I requested my Customers to go some one Way , and some another , to search bad Houses for the Prisoner , and in 2 Hours and a half he was taken . I charged him with the Robbery , and he fell down on his knees and begg 'd Mercy . He owned he had open 'd two Doors with a Knife , and the Cupboard Door with a pair of Scissars . We carried him before Sir William Billers , and there my Shirt was taken from his Back , and all the Money was found upon him within 30 s. I did not make use of any Promises of Favour to get this Confession from him , - 't was all his own , and done generously . Patience Kennedy . My Master ( on the Day this happen 'd ) order 'd me to go up and lock the Lodger 's Doors , and the Door of his Chamber , where the Cupboard was . I did so , and push 'd the Door with my Knee to see if they were fast : Then I laid the Bedcloths smooth in Mr. Bennet 's Room , and came down and put the Keys in the Bar . Then the Prisoner went up to sleep , and staid above Stairs about three quarters of an Hour . I did not know what was in the Cupboard , but I took Notice it was lock 'd before I shut the Chamber Door . Samuel Wall , Constable . I was charged with the Prisoner on the 1st of November at Wapping Wall , and I brought him with a Pair of Oars to the Prosecutor 's House . The Goods were taken from him in the Boat , and I have them here to produce . Burges taxed him with robbing Mr. Brooks and he own 'd it directly , and gave us the Money and Rings . The Watch was in his Pocket , and the Rings upon his Finger which he return 'd with 7 l. 3 s. 9 d. in Money , all which he said he had taken from Mr. Brooks . Brooks . This is my Watch : I have had it these 20 Years , and these are my Rings : One of them was made for my Wife 's Mourning , and the other for my Son 's . This French Crown , I brought from France . These are the Things I lost . Constable . Here 's a Shirt I took off his Back before Sir William Billers . Brooks . I believe it to be mine , - 't was made abroad . I have the Fellow to it , now upon my Back Prisoner . I am a Sailor , and have not been at Brooks 's House since last Summer . I am a perfect Stranger to all this . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . 6. William Cudmore , was indicted for privately stealing 5 Cloth Coats , value 10 l 2 Cloth Wastcoats lac 'd , value 6 l. a Drugget Coat , value 20 s. 2 Sagathy Coats , value 20 s. a silver hilted Sword , value 20 s. 3 silver Spoons , value 30 s 19 silver Tea-spoons value 18 s. a silver Saucepan , value 3 l. 2 silver Salts , value 30 s. a silver Pepperbox , value 20 s. and 2 pair of silver Buckles , value 10 s. the Goods of Gerrard Bottomley , Esq ; in his dwelling House , October 8 . Mr. Bottomley . About the Beginning of October I was robb 'd of several Things . The Evidence Sharp , was my Servant , and he took the Opportunity , when I was out , to let the Prisoner and his Companion Watson into the House . The first Robbery was committed on a Tuesday ; the second , on the Friday following . Two or three Days after they had robb 'd me , I met the Prisoner in the Street , and he told me , if I did not take Care of my sself , I should be robb 'd and murder 'd in the Night ; I thought it was only a Stratagem of his to get Money from me : but however , when I came Home , I told Sharp what Information I had receiv 'd , and he said if I had any Suspicion of him , he would go out of the House ; at that Time , I had not any Suspicion at all of Sharp 's being concern 'd . There is a Suit of Black Cloaths in Court , which the Prisoner pawn 'd to one Johnson . John Sharp . I have known the Prisoner about 14 Months , and since the Beginning of our Acquaintance , we have frequently drank together o'Night . He liv 'd as a Servant to Mr. Bottomley , about 3 Months ago , and I liv 'd with him as a Servant about 9 Weeks ago . While the Prisoner was with Mr. Bottomley , Watson and I call 'd upon him at Mr. Bottomley 's House , and I had some Discourse with him . Two Days after this , we went to Mr. Bottomley 's again , but Cudmore was discharged . We found him at an Alehouse in the Neighbourhood and drank with him , and after this Time , he come every Day to the House where Watson and I lodged , to intreat either of us to endeavour to get into Mr. Bottomley 's Service . Accordingly Watson went to the Gentleman , but he was then engaged . A fortnight afterwards I call 'd upon him , and he told me he wanted a Servant , and he appointed me to meet him at a Coffee House by Lincolns-Inn , where we agreed . We had resolv 'd before , that whoever should be taken into the House , should rob it . 'T was my Misfortune to get the Service , and I went there about 11 o'Clock in the Morning : About 5 the same Day , Watson came to the House , ( Mr. Bottomley being abroad ) and told me that the Prisoner was within Call , but as he was known in the Neighbourhood he was afraid to come yet . About 6 the Prisoner sent a Boy to me , and I sent him Word back , that I was afraid my Master would come Home , and if he should find him , or Watson with me , I might lose the Place . Upon this the Prisoner came himself and insisted on our robbing my Master directly , and he told me , he knew there were Goods of considerable Value in the House , particularly 2 Rings worth 300 l. which lay in a Scrutore , and Bank Notes and Money , and that when we had done the Business , we might all go over to France , and need not stay here to be expos 'd . This was about 6 o'Clock in the Evening , and according to our Resolution , he went to the Kitchen and took out of the Table-drawer , 2 Chopping Knives , and He , Watson and I , went up 2 Pair of Stairs and took a Chest from the Wall ; Then with the Chopping Knives he broke it open , and made Watson and I hold up the Lid , while he took out 6 or 7 Suits of Cloaths , then we set the Chest in it 's proper Place again . There were several Suits taken out , Black and other Colours , and some Linnen , but I was in too great a Hurry to take particular Notice of the Things . The Prisoner and Watson carry 'd them down Stairs on their Arms into the Kitchen , and desired me to look out of Doors to see if the Street was clear ; I told them I saw no Body near , upon which they both went out of the House with all the Cloaths , and left me behind them in the House . I had desired Watson to bring me a clean Shirt the next Morning , because I was to go with my Master to the Bank , and he came accordingly . I asked him what he and the Prisoner had done with the Cloaths ? He told me that they had carry 'd them off in a Coach , and that Cudmore had pawned one Suit for 46 s. I did not see the Prisoner from the Time he carry 'd away the Goods , till the Friday Morning following : My Master sent me then , to Market for a Shoulder of Mutton , and as I was buying some Apples , Cudmore came by ; I told him I expected to have seen him before now ; says he I have sold and pawn 'd all the Cloaths , and lost the Money ; so how could I come to you ? Am I ( say 'd I to him ) to be used so , by a Villain ? - I was pleased to use that Expression , - and struck him over the Face . Prisoner . I was not in the House , I staid at the Door ; and the Evidence Sharp , and Watson brought down the Cloaths to me to sell for them , and I dispos 'd of them - purely out of Friendship to the two Men . Daniel Jones . I live in Monmouth-Street , and sell Second hand Cloaths . A Neighbour of mine , one Flemming , that keeps a Publick-House , came and told me that two Men had brought a parcel of Cloaths in a Coach to his House for Sale ; so I went to look at them : The Prisoner at the Bar and a young Fellow took me up Stairs to see them : There was an old Suit of Cloaths , and three old Coats ; they were all old Fashion 'd Things , except a Black Coat . The Prisoner said he would not bate a Farthing of 4 Guineas for them , but I bought them for 3 l. 5 s. Some Time after this , Mr. Bottomley , and Mr. Keat came and asked me , if I had bought any Cloaths at the Checquer Alehouse in King-Street ? I said yes , and shew 'd them the Cloaths ; Mr. Bottomley said , they were his and I delivered them immediately . Mr. Bottomley . These are my Cloaths . - Caddy . I live with Mr. Johnson , a Pawn broker in Wych Street . On the 5th of October the Prisoner brought these Cloaths ( another Parcel ) to pawn ; I think he had 45 Shillings on them . He said they were a Gentleman 's of his Acquaintance . Mr. Bottomley . These likewise are my Cloaths . Prisoner . I do n't think that I am any Ways guilty of a Robbery ; I hope I am not , - if I had I should have been willing to have taken Part of the Money . As for this 45 Shillings which I had upon these Things , I sent a Guinea of it to Sharpe , and I really did lose all the rest . I went to the Piazzas , but I had no great Notion of the Play , - so I lost it presently . I humbly hope you 'll take it into Consideration , and transport me , rather than hang me . James Caset , gave the Prisoner a Character of a quiet , civil Man . The Jury found him Guilty , Death . 7. Samuel Cook , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of Hannah Allen , in the Parish of St. Stephen Wallbrook , between the Hours of 1 and 3 in the Night , and stealing twelve linnen Table-cloths , value 3 l. twelve linnen Napkins , value 12 s. four white linnen Aprons , value 10 s. three Cambrick Handkerchiefs , value 4 s. three Muslin Handkerchiefs , value 4 s. two Muslin Hoods , value 22 d. eight coarse Towels , value 4 s. six Silver Tea-spoons , value 10 s. one Silver Tea-strainer , value 6 s the Goods of Hannah Allen ; and 18 pair of black Silk Stockings , value 9 l. six pair of white Silk Stockings , value 3 l. 25 yards of white Silk Tabby , value 4 l. 22 yards of grey Silk Tabby , value 4 l. the Goods of William Satchwell ; and four Guineas , the Money of John Davis , in the Dwelling-house of Hannah Allen , Octob . 21 .

Mrs. Allen . I live in Buckler's-bury ; the 22d of October my House was broke open , between 1 and 3 in the Night , and I was robb 'd of the Things mention 'd in the Indictment ; the Watchman knock 'd us up , because he found the Door opens The Prisoner had been my Servant ; I keep a Tavern , and he was my Errand-boy . I lost a dozen of Table-cloths , a dozen of Napkins , 6 Handkerchiefs , Cambrick and Muslin , 6 gilt Tea-spoons and a Strainer , a Velvet Hood , and a Scarlet Cloth Cloak , and 4 Aprons . The Linnen was in a Place that was like a Seat , to sit upon , and I believe they could not have been found , but by Some-body that knew the House . He had been gone away from me 3 Weeks or a Month before I was robb 'd . The Goods were advertis 'd the next Day , and the Prisoner was taken up on Suspicion , and carry 'd before Justice Midford , where he confess 'd the Fact . He was ask 'd to sign his Confession , but he refus 'd to do that . The Substance of it was , that he and Richard Williams , and another , ( whose Name I have forgot ) came in through the Window ; that the Pin not being fast , he took it out , and then threw up the Sash ; that they then got into the House , and took the Goods , which they carry 'd to several Persons Houses , who knew them to be stole . I employ 'd the Constable only in the Affair , and he brought me some of my Linnen again . The Whole of it , I believe , is mine , but Part of it I can positively swear to . Hen Mold , Constable . On the First of November , or the latter end of October , I found the Prisoner at a naughty House in the Cole-yard in St. Giles 's . I brought him away , but he would not speak 'till I got him to my House . I ask 'd him if he knew Dick Williams ? He shook his Head , and said , yes , I know him to my Sorrow ; 't is he that has brought me to all this ; and he desir 'd me to go back to the House where I took him , for he was sure that Williams and Humphries would come there . I went there to look for them , but one Sue Chapman had given them Notice to get out of the Way . The Prisoner inform 'd me , that his Companions were to be paid for the Goods that were dispos 'd of at one Harbin 's in Leicester-street , by Hockley in the Hole , but they never came there for the Money , nor did we find any of the Things at Harbin 's House , but he help 'd us to some of the Linnen , a piece of black Tabby , and some of the Stockings again . The Prisoner Carter own 'd before Justice Midford that she carry 'd the Goods to Harbin , to sell for these Men . John Davis gave an Account , that he was Mrs. Allen 's Drawer , and that the Windows and Doors were fast over Night ; that he lost 4 Guineas , some Silver , and 18 d. in Half-pence , out of a Cupboard which was nail 'd up in the Yard , and likewise a pair of Pumps . That the Prisoner confess 'd he got thro ' the Window , and broke open the Cupboard , and had pawn 'd the Pumps . William Satchwell . I left two dozen of Silk Stockings , and two pieces of Tabby at Mrs. Allen 's , which she inform 'd me were stole with her Goods . I believe these to be the same which I lost . Hen . Mold . The Prisoner told me , that if it had not been for him , his two Companions would have murder 'd the Maids , and the Mistress too . Harbin . The Goods were brought to Sue Chapman 's House , and there I saw them . The Prisoner Carter brought them from thence to my House , and desir 'd me to dispose of them . I was to get what I could for them , and was to be paid for my Trouble . The two Prisoners , and Williams and Humphries , coming daily after me for the Money , I got one Mrs. Stokes , who is run away , to help to sell them . I receiv 'd 4 l. from her , and gave the two Prisoners some part of the Money ; some part I kept my self , and 5 s. Stokes had for her Trouble . I ask 'd the Prisoner Cook how he came by the Goods , and he told me they were safe enough , for they got them 10 Miles off . The Monday after Lord Mayor 's Day , Cook and Williams , and Humphries were quarrelling at an Alehouse , and Cook said if they had not been Fools , they might have gone up Stairs , and have got 150 l. One of them reply 'd , we should then have disturb 'd them , upon which Cook said , if they had made any Noise , we would have blown all their Brains out . I dispos 'd of the Spoons , and the Prisoner had his Share of the Money at the Black-Bull upon Saffron Hill . Prisoner Carter . Ask him how he can have the Assurance to say the Goods were brought to my Room without his Knowledge ? He and Sue Chapman brought them to me , to look at , and I fastned my Door with the Poker . Tho . Morris gave much the same Account with John Davis . The Jury acquitted Carter , and found Cook guilty of Felony only , 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9. William Hardesty , was indicted for assaulting Painter Cade in the Street , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Penknife , value 6 d. and 3 s. 6 d. in Money , Octob 25 . Mr. Cade . On the 25th of October , between 12 and 1 in the Morning , the Prisoner stopp 'd me in Chiswell-street , and clapping a loaded Pistol to my Head , he cry 'd , D - n your Bl - d , - your Money . Immediately another laid hold of me with a long Knife , and he cry 'd out , - your Money , quickly , or else we 'll shoot you ; upon which I deliver 'd them 3 s. 6 d. and some Half-pence . The Prisoner search 'd me for my Watch , and then they walk 'd off , swearing if I turn 'd after them , they would shoot me through the Head . I went cross the Way , and saw two Watchmen ; then I cry 'd out , Stop Thief , and the Prisoner took up a Court that was no Thorough-fare : I follow 'd him , and he ran out of the Court again , and made down White-cross-street , and though I pursu 'd and call 'd out stop Thief , yet he ran past two Watchmen , and they never attempted to stop him , but in Beech-lane this little Watchman fell 'd him with his Staff . I am positive to the Prisoner , for he was never out of my Sight , but just turning the Corner . My Penknife was found in the Prisoner 's Pocket , and a loaded Pistol ; the other Man ran away with my Money . Robert Wilson . The Prosecutor calling out stop Thief , and the Prisoner running toward my Stand in Beech-Lane , I bid him stand twice , he refused , and so I knocked him down , - that I did indeed ; then the Gentleman came up and charged him with robbing him ; so we carried him to the Watch-house , and found a Pistol upon him , and this naked Fork . Guilty . Death . 10. William Brown , was indicted for assaulting William Haines in a Field near the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a pair of wrought base Metal Buckles , value 12 d Oct. 12 . William Haines On the 12th of Oct. about 9 in the Evening , I was coming with some Friends from Mr. Dobney 's , and in the Field between the Pond and the New River Head , I stopp 'd to make Water , my Company being a little Way before me , I call 'd to them , and bid them not go without me , and presently I heard a Cry of Murder , and a Pistol was fired . I was going to make up to my Company and a Man stopp 'd me , and demanded my Money , Watch and Rings , and gave me a Knock on the Head , I told him I had no Watch but he searched me all down to my Shoes , and said here 's a good pair of Buckles , and took them away ; then he jump 'd away , and a Pistol went off , and one of them cry 'd , D - n you take that among you . After I was robb 'd I ran back to Dobney 's and got his Man to come over the Fields with me with two Dogs . We call 'd in at Sadler's-Wells , and there I found my Friends and the Prisoner . Joseph Critchley . I was coming from Dobney 's with 4 Friends , and I happen 'd to be foremost ; when I came to the Stile , I saw the Prisoner and two more , one of each Side of him . The Prisoner jump 'd off the Stile , and said D - n your Bl - ds deliver this Minute . I was surpriz 'd , and while I was putting my Hand in my Pocket , I heard a Pistol go off at one of my Friends behind me : Then I heard another Friend say , - fight away Boys , they have nothing but Powder , the Prisoner immediately clapp 'd a Pistol to my Face , I struck it by with my Hand , and off it went . Then I grasp 'd him about the Middle , and he broke my Head , I suppose with his Pistol , I held him 'till one of my Friends came up and knocked him down . He never was from us , nor out of my Sight , but the other two ran away . Haines was the last Man in the Company ; what happen 'd to him I ca n't tell , but we carried the Prisoner to Sadler's-Wells ; and when he came in to us there , his Buckles were out of his Shoes . The Prisoner confessed the next Day , that he had sent to the Men that were concern 'd with him in this Business , to tell them that they had no need to abscond in order to get them taken up , and with an Intent to impeach them .

Martin Stevens , confirmed the foregoing Evidence , and deposed , that he gave the Prisoner several Blows before he knock 'd him down ; that the Prisoner call 'd to his Companions and bid them fire ; upon which a Pistol was fired among them ; upon which the Prisoner got up and would have run off , but they secur 'd him directly , and carried him to Mr. Forcer 's ( Sadler 's Wells ) and from thence to Justice Poulson , who committed him . Prisoner . These two Men that were with me perswaded me to go out with them , I did , and at Holloway they proposed robbing the first Man that came by .

When I heard that Neighbour Smith had found his Horse , I went to the Prisoners Stable to look for mine , but the Man of the House would not let me see the Horses ; however , I found my Gelding at Dawley Lodge , in the Possession of Josiah Alderson , who told us he had him of the Prisoner . The Prisoner told us he caught the Horse , by pulling some Oats out of a Rick , and offering them to him . I swore to my Horse and have had him again . Alderson depos 'd , that he had the Horse of the Prisoner the first of Nov. last , that the Prisoner dealt in Horses , and that he took him to be an Honest Man . Prisoner .

On Friday the 21st of October , I was attack 'd by 4 Footpads in the Enfield Stage-Coach ; in a Lane , about a Mile and a half on this side Enfield . Their Persons I do n't know : They broke the wooden Window of the Coach , and then forc 'd open the Door . One of them rush 'd in , and the others stood without . The Man that demanded my Money had a Pistol in his Hand . I told them if they would be civil they should have it , and I pull 'd out my Purse and told them there was a Guinea in it . The Fellow that took it , said , we must have more from such Gentlemen as you , I told him he could have no more , unless it was a little Silver . He damanded that , and as I was putting my Hand in my Pocket , he caught hold of the String of my gold Watch and pull 'd it out by Force : Then he took what Silver I ' had , and attack 'd Mr. Adams . Mr. Adams . On the 21st of October , as Mr. Gough and I were going to Endfield , we were attack 'd in the Evening between 5 and 6 by 3 or 4 Footpads : They stopp 'd the Coach , but I ca n't say I remember any of their Faces . One of them stepp 'd into the Coach ; cut my Breeches , and took from me 10 Guineas , and 1 Guinea and some Silver besides . I saw them rob Mr. Gough and take his Watch from him : When they went off , they went towards London . Mr. Gough . I went to Newgate to see the Prisoners , and there Terry Gerrard confess 'd to me , that he was in that Robbery ; he told me where my Watch was , and who it was sold to . Kirk was taken up on the other Side of the Water , for another Robbery . James Wint . The 2 Prisoners , John Peirce and I , robb 'd the Endfield Coach , between Endfield and Edmonton ; 't was in the Evening between 5 and 6 o'Clock . I saw Mr. Gough and Mr. Adams in the Coach : There were none but they in it . There were 3 Horses to the Coach and I was at their Heads , while they robb 'd them . Mr. Gough was robb 'd first , and because they could not readily find Mr. Adams 's Money , Kirk cry 'd , tear his Pocket , or cut it down : He stood with his Hat thus , and as Gerrard took the Money , he put it into Kirk 's Hat . The other Man stood at the Coach Door . When we first stopp 'd the Coach , Gerrard took a Pistol from under his Coat , and held it to the Coachman to make him stop . The Coachman flourish 'd his Whip at him , but seeing the Pistol , he stood still : Then he broke the Window with his Pistol , and burst open the Door and jump 'd into the Coach . John Peirce stood likewise with a Pistol , cock 'd and loaded , and Gerrard 's Pistol was loaded too . When we had robb 'd them , we went directly towards London . I never was in their Companies before , to commit a Robbery : This was the first Time , and I hope 'twill be the last . The Money we shar 'd 2 or 3 Fields distant from the Place where we stopp 'd the Coach , and the Watch was sold the Saturday afterwards for 6 Guineas , and I had a Guinea and a half of the Money . Gerrard and Peirce sold it to a Jew , whose Name is Moses . James Mead , Coachman . I drove the Coach ; 't was stopp 'd by 4 Footpads . I ca n't swear to the Prisoners , and a Man in such a Coat as this Wint has now on , held the Horses . They broke the Coach Window , and burst open the Door . I flourish 'd my Whip , and was about to whip the Man that laid hold of the Horses , but another came and took hold of my Leaders ; 't was the little Man that jump 'd into the Coach . William Wint . I am Wint , the Evidence 's Brother . Upon his Information , I went after Peirce and Gerrard . About 9 o'Clock I took Gerrard , in Fleet-street , in Bethnal Green Hamlet . I found out his Lodging , and broke open the Door ; he was in Bed , but I jump 'd in , and threw my self upon the Bed ; then I threw off the Bed-cloaths for Fear he should have had Fire Arms , and catching hold of his Hands , I call 'd in my Assistants . I told him I came to enquire after Capt . Gough 's Watch ; then , says he , I am a dead Man , and his Wife ran to the Bed-side and took a silver Watch , which she put into her Bosom . Well , says the Prisoner , this wo n't save your Brother 's Life , because you have taken none but me ; yes , says I. Grafton Kirk is in Goal . When we had secur 'd him , I look 'd about the Room and saw his Coat hang up ; we search 'd it and found a loaded Pistol in the Pocket , which was draw 'd at Justice Farmer 's . Philip Moreau gave much the same Account with the foregoing Witness , adding , that Gerrard own 'd before Justice Farmer , that he was the Man that took the Watch and the Money from Capt . Gough , and he wish 'd he had done for others , as they had done for him ; that there were others of the Company that deserv 'd hanging more than Jonathan Wild , and nam 'd a Man that keeps a public House in Brick-lane , as the Author of his Ruin . Levi Lamskin , confirm 'd the proceeding Evidence . William Maggs . I am a Watchmaker , and having advertis 'd Capt . Gough 's Watch , a Person brought it to me , one Loyd a Watchmaker in Smithfield , Loyd told me he had it from a Jew that he work 'd for , and that this Jew had receiv 'd it in Pawn from another Jew for 16 l. I paid 15 Guineas for it . He told me the Jew 's Name , that he had it from , was Solomon Moses , a Fellow with one Eye , that goes about with a Bell-harp . Peter Perrimonie , spake to the taking of Gerrard in the Manner before related , and inform 'd the Court , that he acknowledg 'd he was concern 'd in this Robbery ; and that they had sold the Watch to a Jew that lives in a pav 'd Alley in the Minories for 6 Guineas . He likewise produc 'd the Pistol that was taken out of his Coat-pocket . Geo Coleman . About the 26th of October I was passing down Kennington-Lane , and met ( between 8 and 9 at Night ) a Man and a Woman , who told me there were Highwaymen in the Lane : I ask 'd how many there were ? They told me , two , and that they had robb 'd him . I said , I had nothing about me but my Hanger ; however , I went with him after them : At a Place call 'd Sot 's Hole we had a Description of them , and pursu 'd them . Before I came up with them I drew my Hanger , and at the End of the Turning I overtook them , and one of them bid me Good-night , and ask 'd me if I wanted any Thing with them ? I seiz 'd one of them , and ask 'd the Man that was with me , if these were the Men that had robb 'd him ? He said , yes ; and then the Man that I had seiz 'd began to struggle with me , and the Prisoner Kirk drew his Pistol , and fir 'd it full in my Face , all the Shot are now in my Face : I was stunn 'd with the Shot , but as soon as I recover 'd my self , I imagin 'd he was going to load again , so I quitted my Man , and ran upon the Prisoner , to prevent his firing upon me again , and cut him twice over the Hands , before I could make him quit his Pistol . I carry 'd him to the-White-Hart in Kennington-lane , and from thence he was sent to Goal . He own 'd he was the Man that shot me in the Face , but I heard nothing at all of Capt . Gough 's Affair . Isaiah Bennet , John Munns , Abraham Fenton , James Walton , Tho Sullivan , Geo Jefferies , Nathan Gaze , Sam . Buckley , Jane Thurtle , and Ann Arnold , spake to the Prisoner 's ( Kirk 's ) Character , but no one appear 'd to Gerrard 's . The Jury found them both Guilty . Death .

On Sunday Night the 23d of October I took Coach in Cheapside , between 11 and 12 o'Clock , and drove to the Bottom of Holborn . Hardesty and the Evidence James James , walk 'd up on the right side of the Way by the Coach-side about a quarter of a Mile . Above Holborn bars the Evidence James stopp 'd the Coach , then the Prisoner Hardesty went up to the Horses Heads , and the Evidence came to me with a cock 'd Pistol , and demanded my Money . He put his Hand into my Pocket , and took 18 d. which I had put in a Pocket by it self to pa the Coachman ; and I believe he took a half Guinea likewise , for I miss 'd it the next Day . The Witness demanded my Watch , but I wrench 'd the Pistol out of his Hand , and then he ran away . Upon this Hardesty came up to me with another Pistol ; I threw myself half out of the Coach , and snapp 'd this Pistol at him , calling out , Watch ! Watch ! and then he ran away too . I ca n't say I saw any other than Hardesty and the Evidence , though the Witness says , that Piper was concern 'd . They were taken up for another Robbery , and I went to see them ; Hardesty own 'd the whole Affair , and I shew 'd the Pistol : Hardesty confess 'd the Robbery , and ask 'd Piper if he did not know that Pistol ? I had no Discourse with Piper that was any Thing to the Purpose . James James . I was one of the Persons that robb 'd Mr. Clark on the 23d of October in a Coach , the upper End of Holborn by the Bars ; the two Prisoners were with me . Piper was on the off side of the Horses Heads in the Highway : Hardesty and I walk 'd on one side , and Piper walk 'd on the other side of the Way . Mr. Clark . The Wind was on the left side of the Coach , therefore I drew up that Window . James . Piper went to the Horses Heads , while I robb 'd the Gentleman , and Hardesty stood at the other side of the Coach . I open 'd the Door on the right side , and put my Hand into his Pocket : I took out three Pieces , one of which I dropp 'd , and there remain 'd but a Shilling and a Six-pence . The Prisoners had Pistols , as well as I , and that which the Gentleman has produc 'd I had from Piper ; he bought it about three Days before . The 18 d. was shar 'd in my Room , and the two Prisoners had 6 d. each , which we spent at an Alehouse facing Drury-lane . Mr. Clark .

Edmund South On Monday Night the 24th of Oct. about 6 o'Clock as I was walking to Stoke Newington , two Fellows assaulted me , and clapp 'd Pistols to me . I believe the Prisoner was one , and this Evidence ( Harrison ) is another . 'T was very Moonlight when they attack 'd me ; they robb 'd me of the Things mentioned in the Indictment , and I am very positive that the Evidence Harrison was one of them James Harrison . The first Time I ever engag 'd in this Way was Sunday Night the 23d of Oct. last , and we did not do any Thing that Night - we had 10 s. between us then . Next Morning Grafton , Kirk , Terry Gerrard and I met , and we kept Company all that Day together . ( I was not in the Robbery of Captain Gough and Mr . Adams . ) On the 24th of Oct. we parted Company : Kirk and the Prisoner said they would meet the rest of us in Islington Church yard . In order to meet them I went by the Farthing-Pye house ; there was an Uproar there about an Informer against a Seller of Gin ; I staid in the Croud , and Grafton Kirk and the Prisoner came out of the House , and we joined Company again ; we drank a Pint of Wine there , and then we proceeded ; and the Prisoner and I stopp 'd Mr. South in a Field , while our Companions was in the Road . When we two met the Prosecutor , he had his Cane and his Sword in his Hand , which he took from him . I took one of his Buckles out of his Shoe , and then Terry Gerrard came running up to us and took the other . Shaw began to rifle him first , he presented a Pistol to his Breast ; there was another Gentleman with the Prosecutor , but he prevented his going away , by presenting his Pistol to him , telling him he would shoot him if he went away . Mr. South . I believe there was three of them about us . Prisoner . I do n't know where Islington is ; I never was there in my Life . A Witness . The Prisoner acknowledged that he was with Harrison and Kirk , and was concern 'd in taking the Gentleman 's Buckles and Sword . - Whittle . I was robb 'd at the same Time on Horseback : I know no more , but that about a Week afterwards I was desired by some Men to come over the Water to the White-Horse for Information about my Watch , so I went , and from thence to the New Jail , and the Prisoner told me , my Watch was pawn 'd upon Tower-Hill , and I went according to his Directions and found it . I ca n't say any Thing concerning Mr. South 's Robbery . Harrison . There were generally five of us in Company , and some of us us 'd to be employ 'd in one Place , and some in another . This is Mr. South 's Cane , I sent for it 12 Miles - out of the Country . George Holderness . Mr. Justice Lade sent to a Constable to apprehend the Prisoner , and he desir 'd me to go with him . We went to Dark house-lane and took the Prisoner ; as we were carrying him to Goal , he asked us , why we did not take Harrison , for he was ( he said ) concern 'd in the Robberies with him , and ought to suffer as well as he . He told me if I would come to him in the Morning , he would tell me of an hundred People concern 'd in Robberies on the Highway . Guilty , Death . 28 , 29.

I left the Things mentioned in the Indictments , in a Nest of Drawers in my Lodging Room : When I came Home , I found I had been robb 'd , and the Lock seem 'd as if it had been push 'd back with a Chissel . - Mason . I live in Mr. Wilson 's Neighbourhood ; hearing of the Robbery between 8 and 9 o'Clock the same Night , I went to him , and he shew 'd me the Door , some Wood on one Side was shiver 'd ; I told him the Fact must have been committed by some Body that knew his House . He had a Suspicion of one Plew , but when we went to look after him , we found him a-bed and a-sleep . I enquir 'd for the Prisoner Osborn , who lodg 'd on the same Floor with Plew , but we were inform 'd she was gone . This gave me a farther Suspicion of her , and I came again between 11 and 12 to enquire for her . I found her and her Landlady disputing about something ; I told her she knew something I believe about her Master Wilson 's being robb 'd , ( for she had been a Servant with him ) and I Flung the Bolster off of her Bed , there I found a Pocket , with 4 Guineas , a quarter Guinea , 2 half-Crowns and some Farthings Upon this I went to Mr. Wilson , and told him I believ 'd I had found the Thief , and I got two Watchmen and charg 'd them with her . She begg 'd for Mercy , and told us , that she had left the Woman that was concern 'd with her in the Robbery , at the Rising-Sun in Bishopgate street . We went there and forc 'd into the House , I ask 'd for the other Prisoner Clark , but they denied her . The Woman of the House said , she had been there , but she was gone to Winford-Street . As we were going there , we met her with the Gold Chain about her Neck , and carried her to the Watch house . Upon her I found 6 l. and upwards , and observ 'd her to fling something away from her , which prov 'd to be the Notes mentioned in the Indictment . In her Room I found the Chissel that ( I suppose they had open 'd the Door with ) Osborn said Clark perswaded her to do it , and she own 'd she open 'd the Door with the Chissel . Clark had the Chain upon her , and Osborn own 'd that the Money I found in her Room was Part of Wilson 's Money . Ann Wilson . The Constable and Watchman confirm 'd Mr. Mason 's Evidence . Osborn . Ann Clark the Prisoner perswaded me to do this . Clark . Osborn put the Chain about my Neck , while I was in Liquor . Guilty , Death . 30.

Do as you think fit , but if you value your Life , and your Son 's Life , leave the Money , and you shall receive no Harm from us . Mrs. Briar . This Letter was found the Day before Michaelmas-day : About a Fortnight after , the Prisoner was taken up , and when he was carry 'd to Sir William Billers 's Office , he sent for my Mistress ; she did not care to go to him , so I went and desir 'd him to make a Confession , if he knew any Thing of the Letters . He told me , he would say Nothing , but to my Mistress her self ; I told him he might write his Mind to her , and accordingly he took Pen , Ink , and Paper , and went into another Room and wrote this Letter . I saw him take a Peice of Wax , out of his Pocket , and dabb 'd it on the Letter , and fasten 'd it down with his Thumb . The sealing this Letter , was so like those found in our Yard , that it immediately put me in Mind of them . This was the Letter he sent by me to my Mistress . Honoured Madam , No Man did induce me to do this , but the Man at the White-Swan , who promis 'd me a Reward , so I like a Fool took his Advice , and I ask your Pardon for this great Fault , which I acknowledge with all my Heart . It was he that did throw the Letters into the Yard at your House . Do not send me to New-gate , but any where else where you please . I am your most humble Servant to command , ABEL WILLIAMS . Mrs. Brian . The second Time I went to him , he desir 'd my Mistress not to send him to Newgate , and he would come and make a Confession against the Man , whenever she pleas 'd ; I told him he had done too many bad Things , for my Mistress to release him ; and that the Spoon and the Candlestick which were taken from him by the Constable , were my Mistresses . He own 'd his taking them , and that he put them into his Pocket to sell that very Day . Margaret Gibson . I took up this 2d Letter in my Mistresses Yard , facing the Window , the 2d of Oct. wrapp 'd up , and ty 'd in this Piece of Blanket . ( The Letter was read ) To Mrs. Alderson , `` Madam , Since you deceiv 'd us we will try you one other Time , and we will come some Night next Week , if you leave the Money , it will be well for your self and Family : if you leave it not , we will do as we told you in the first Letter . We give you no ill Words , nor bad Language , and it lies in your own Power to make yourself both easy and happy Think not to escape us . if you leave not the Money , for we shall light of you when you little think of it . I . B. W. Brown , & c. Prisoner . Margaret Brian came to me at Sir William Billers 's Office , and told me if I would make a Confession , my Mistress would forgive me . I own I wrote the Letter she carried from me to her . Mrs. Brian . I only said , if he would make a Confession , he would save his own Life , and he told me he would confess to no one but her self . Henry James . I was sent by my Mistress to see for the Prisoner one Day , and I found him with Thurston at the White Swan in Leaden hall street . I told him my Mistress wanted him ; he charged me to take no Notice who was with him , and Thurston said , pray do n't ; but I came Home and told my Lady that the Prisoner was with Thurston , upon which she was very much frighted . After this I went to call a Constable ; he was at a Barber 's and there I found Thurston ; they were talking of the Thing I believe , for I heard Thurston say , he would not do such a Fact for 10,000 l. Mrs. Alderson . I had an Information that the Man at the White-Swan had taken up the Stone after the first Letter was found ; upon which , I sent for him , and he own 'd he came that Night , and look 'd under the Stone for the Money ; but he told me he was drunk , or else he should not have done it . This gave me however , a bad Opinion of him , and I order 'd my Servants never to go to his House to drink . About a Fortnight after , the Prisoner was abroad , and I sent my Footman to look for him , he brought me Word he was drinking with Thurston at his House . When the Prisoner came in , I ask 'd him who he had been drinking with ? He told me he had been with one whose Name I did not know . I let him know that the Footman inform 'd me he had been with Thurston , the Prisoner replied , - then he 's a Rascal for his Pains , - if he had not told you , I never would . In a few Days after this I discharg 'd him , and when he was gone , I look 'd over some Bills of his , and imagined the Hand-writing of some of them bore a Resemblance with the Letters ; upon which I enquir 'd after him again , and he was taken up . Thurston . The first Time that ever I saw the Prisoner in my Life , was when the Lady sent for me to her House ; he was then call 'd into the Room to speak to Mr. Mispley about these Letters . They ask 'd me if I had not search 'd the Place for the Money ? I said , I was that Night disguised in Liquor , and a Gentleman being at the House and saying there had been Threatning Letters sent to Mrs. Alderson , and that there was a Watch set , both within , and without the House , I had the Curiosity to go down to see how the Watch stood : I own 'd I went down , and that I saw no Watch , and that I did kick up the Stone . At that Time I did not know where the Lady liv 'd , nor her Name , but I did kick up the Stone indeed . On the Sunday after , I went to an Alehouse , the 3 Crowns to enquire for the Prisoner . I saw him , and asked him how his Lady did , and whether she was easy , or had any Mistrust of me . When the Lady 's Footman came to enquire for the Prisoner at my House , I do n't remember my ordering him to deny he was with me , for I took no Observation of the Thing .
