From thence he carried to the Round-house and being searched , there were found in his Pocket Two large silver Medals , and piece of Old which were in Court , and sworn to be the Deceased 's by the Landlady and another Evidence to whom the Deceased had several times them , the Prisoner had likewise Two gold Rings which he said went his own , and was bid to put them on , One of which he could not being bear , the other he did , all being on his Finger a Gentelman asked whar was the Posies of them , answer 'd itwas all , but when they were viewed had no Poesy , but one of these the Leudrs L.U.R . and the other marked with the M.V.A . the same with which the Deceased I , was marked , he had likewise found in his Pocket Sword of the same Cloth of the Deceased 's that about Seven of Eight Thursday the 17th , He going toward about Hundred Yards beyond pound on the Road , found a Coat wet and bloody , but most on the inside , that he carried it house , and in One of the Pocket 's he found a Ticket of the Company of signed and supporting that the Owner of the Coat had come by some misfortune , went away immediately and enquire him out , and showing him the Note and him how he came by He owned into be his Hand , adn directed him to the Prisoner 's Lodging whether he went with the ulmost Hapedicron , and having taken of a two from the Coast he found , showing it to the Deceased 's Landlady . immediately said it was Button beginning to her Lodger 's the Deceased 's Cost , and upon sight of the Cost said it was his , that thereupon Market , and enquiring farther he had very great reason to suspect the Prisoner , and procured him to be apprehended as has been before related . The dead Body not being found , several Persons went in Quest of it but could not find it , but his Hat was found in Field not very far from where the Cost was taken up . Ralph Gold deposed that he got a Creeper and crept the Food in the Field , near where the Cost was found he pull 'd out the Decreased 'd Hat , which has several Cuts in it , that answered to those in the Wig and Head of the Deceased , ( which Hat was also produc 'd in Court ) that there being some Chick-weed on the Coat , she was told that there were Ponds in some farther Fields where was chickweed , that in the Third Freid be found Ponds , and near the Pond side he perceived the Ground had been trampled , and perceived Blood , followed the Track , and near the Edge of the Pond saw a great Quantity of clotted Blood , and the deceased 's Sword out of the but broken , and that a Knife was there taken up by another Person , which was sworn to be the Prisoner 's Knife , and which he owned to be his Knife when it was show 'd him and that creeping that Pond his Creeper took hold of the Deceased 's Breeches , the Body lying at the side of the Pond under some Bushes as it has been stamped in the Mud . That he had all his Cloath on but Coat , Hat and Wigg , his Pocket , turned inside out , but one in which was a knife and Fork , the Body was afterwards view 'd by several that knew the Deceased and to be the Body of John Hoemg R.in the Surgeon deposed . That there were several Wounds on the temporal muscles , that they were between all to that opening the Head he found a Concustion of Blood upon the Brain , but did not think the Wounds but that he was first what Weapon He could not lay , and then suffocated in the Pond . Many of the these Curcumstances were confirmed by Vuiety of Evidence and many more too long here to relate . The prisoner being called to make Defence , denied his knowing thing of the Murther , and being asked since , about Six a-Clock , as had been proved they went out together what be use of To which he answered . They went to Halborn , adn there Parted , he going one Way , and the Deceased another . Being asked where he was the paid be all Night at the Night Cellar at appeared , they having sent to enquire , he was after Ton of the Clock till next Morning , drinking with Porten , Chairmen , and such like which did for his Diversion , but probably to divert the Horror of his Mind . ) But being called upon to prove where he was from Six of the Clock all Eight he said he was at House but could not preduce the least proof of it . Being asked how he came by the Deceased 's Rings , Medals , Belts , Pocket-Book , Letter-Cafe and Cane , he answer 'd he had paid a Guineas for the Deceased 's Passage from Holland,7 Stuling , per With for his Diet , and lent him Money at several times , and the Deceded had put all his Effects into his Hand , on that Account , Being asked how he came to have the Wig that it appeared the Deceased was murdered in , he gave no other Answer . Being asked how his Knife came by the Pond-side where the Deceased was found murdered he alleged , that the Deceased to rowed it of him . The only Evidences he celled were two foreign Women , and Van ; the Sum of whole Evidences amounted only to this , That they had known that the Prisoner has sometimes used to Blood at the Nose . By that be endeavourred to account for the Bloodeness of his Shirt , neck and Sleeves , but being asked how they came to be wet and , as well as bloody , he said he let them fall . Another Evidence ( a Gentleman that happened to be present when the Prisoner was in the Round-house , and who spared no Pams to trace the Matter ) deposed . This be having heard the Deceased had been at Hampton-Court , went , was informed he had , and that Beron Bathmar of the one , and that he had been presented to his Majesty , who him some Guiness also , but what Number he had not learnt , so that it appear 'd very probable , it was their Generosity that brought the unfortunate Gentleman to that tragical end . Thus ended the Prisoner 's Tryal , for a Murther as barbarous as it was providentially discovered , and traced by Persons who had no other than and Justice , and he to opportunity , that , in Probablity , in one Hour more be might have got out of the reach of the Avengers of Blood . The Jury considering the whole Matter , without found him guilty of three Indictment . I would only beg the to this Remark . That the Prisoner away with him some Thing of the Deceased 's of to small Value , as particular by the Belt and Wag , which were strong Evidences against him , and especially the Wig , which was not only a very remarkable one , but some for which no Man would have given Half a Crown , carries in it strong Indi of in Persons guilty of such barbarous Inhumanity , and that Saying of one of the , demand .
