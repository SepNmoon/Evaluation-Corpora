They were a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for feloniously staying the said Whitesides . Mr. How . January 14 , about three or four in the Afternoon , I sent George Hart , ( who was my Apprentice ) to the Barber 's with my Wig , and hearing a Hubbub , I opened my Window , and saw the Prisoner Carter beating him ; I came down Stairs , and told the Deceased , ( who was likewise my Servant ) that somebody was beating the Boy ; I ran to Carter , and asked him , why he beat my Apprentice ; he would have run away , but I tripped up his Heels , and resolved to carry him before Justice Deveil . But he not being at Home , I brought him back , in order to have him before some other Magistrate ; as we were going along he desired me not to haul him , he would walk very civilly he said , and would-not run away , but the Minute I had loosen 'd my Hold , he ran away from me , and Dodson ran after him : The Deceased seeing Carter run , pursued him , and had taken him if Dodson had not with a Jostle thrown him down . I went after Carter , but being informed that both the Prisoners lived with Mr. Leeson a Baker , I returned Home , and at the Door I met an Apothecary , who desired me to send for a Surgeon immediately , for my Servant was Speechless and his Skull broke . He lived till Monday , and never had his Senses all that Time . Q . Did you see Dodson throw the Deceased down ? How . When Carter took to his Heels , I cry 'd out , Stop him , - and the Deceased ran after him ; as he passed Dodson he gave him a Hunch , which turned him quite round , and I saw him falling , but did not see him come to the Ground . I saw him ( Dodson ) put out his Foot and trip up his Heels ; 't was done in a Trice . Richard Cajor . On Friday Afternoon , between three and four o'Clock ( I do n't remember the Day of the Month ) I heard a Bustle in the Court , - 't was in Sidney 's Court , by Leicester-Fields , - I was coming through the Court , and saw the Prisoner Carter beating George Hart . Mr. How ( Hart 's Master ) came up , and asked Carter why he beat his Apprentice ; he seized him , and told him he should go before Mr. Deveil , but he not being at Home , Mr. How brought the Prisoner Carter back , and as they came up the Court , he desired not to be held , and said he would walk very civilly ; but when Mr. How let him loose , away he ran , and Whitesides the Deceased ran after him ; but passing by Dodson , he gave him a Jostle as he ran , which turned him quite round , and he fell down backwards with his Head upon the Pavestones ; I helped to take him up , he was stunn 'd with the Fall , and his Head was very bloody . This happened on Friday , and on Sunday Night following I went to see the Deceased , and was to have sat up with him the next Night , but he died on Monday Morning . How . He was in very good Health when I called him out on this Occasion , and was a sober , sedate , good Servant , as any Man could have ; he never spoke but once to a young Man after he had received this Hurt . John Hulet . I saw the Deceased immediately after the Fall ; the Blood ran down from the back Part of his Head , and he sighed and sweat extreamly , and was in an Agony with the Pain ; after we had lifted him out of the Kennel , he desired we would let him sit still a little , and in about four or five Minutes he walked Home . Philip Newton . As Mr. How was bringing the Prisoner Carter through the Court , he desired he might walk without being held , and in two or three Minutes he ran away ; the Deceased ran after him , and as he ran , the other Prisoner gave him a Jostle , which threw him down ; I ca n't be sure whether he jostled him down or tripped him up , but he was the Occasion of his Falling . John Ormered , Surgeon . I was called to the Deceased , I found his Skull fractured and a Concussion upon the Brain , he languished till Monday and then died . I performed the Operation of the Trepan , and after his Death I took off the Top of the Skull . The Fall was the Occasion of his Death . Dodson 's Defence . I live with Mr. Leeson , and Carter is my Fellow Servant . Mr. How 's Apprentice was coming along with a Whig upon his Hand , and Carter struck it in his Face , upon that the Apprentice struck him , so the Fray began . Mr. How came and hauled Carter about , and he desired he might be let go , and when he was at Liberty he ran away , I ran after him , and the Deceased ran between me and a Bulk , and so threw himself down . Carter 's Defence . I happened to touch the Wig with my Hand as I went along , and the Boy flew upon me and struck me . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners , and on the Coroner 's Inquisition found the Deceased 's Death Accidental . 6.

Paul Cross . This ( here ) Man pretended to be my Friend ; about ten or eleven o'Clock at Night , in the Year 1734 , I was coming from Mr. Beal 's , a Gardiner , in Ratcliffe-Highway , and he and another would see me Home to my Father 's in Kent Street Road ; they pretended they would see me safe Home , and just within a Stone 's Cast of East-Smithfield , the Prisoner shoved me down , and took a Knive and Five Shillings and Two-pence from me ; it was over-against a Distiller 's Shop . He said nothing at all to me , but only took my Money from me , and then he went away and left me . Q . Was it Light or Dark when this was done ? Cross . 'T was Dark . Q . When did you see him first after this Fact was committed ? Cross . About a Quarter of a Year afterwards I saw him in Barnaby-street , and as I was speaking to him , and was going to discover my Mind to him , he ran away , and I never saw him since , 'till I saw him in Newgate Q . Did you ever see the Knife afterwards ? Cross . No , never . Q . You say it was dark when you was robb 'd , consider - How was it possible for you to know him again ? Cross . It was dark when he did this ; but I saw him that Day at Mr. Beal 's , between two and three o'Clock in the Afternoon , and he was gathering Cucumbers : He had made an End of his Work , and pretending to be my Friend , would conduct me home , and so he robb 'd me . Prisoner . I never saw the Prosecutor in my Life , as I know of . Pray where did I work ? Cross . At Mr. Beal 's a Gardiner in Ratcliff Highway . Prisoner . Does not your Father go by some other Name ? Cross . My Name is Paul Cross . My Father 's Name is Hercules Cross . Prisoner . Paul ! - O I know him by his Name Paul , very well . He came into Mr. Beal 's when I work 'd there ; but I never saw him before , nor since . I did not know him till he said his Name was Paul , I declare . He was fuddled that Night , and would go down into a sad Place where I never was before ; there were three or four Women there with him , and I left him there , because I did not chuse their Company .

He was a second Time indicted ( on the Statute for Stabbing ) for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on Jan 20. on Charles Dubois , did make an Assault , and in the Fury of his Mind , & c. with a certain Bayonet , & c. the said Charles on the Breast , below the Collar Bone did stab ; he the said Charles not having any Weapon , & c. and giving the said Charles one mortal Wound , & c. ( as above ) of which he languish 'd from the said 20th to the 21st of January , at which Time of the same Wound he died . He was a third Time indicted by Virtue of the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . John Sturgeon . The Deceased was my Fellow Watchman . The Night this Murder was committed , I was upon the Watch with him , and as I was giving the Hour of Twelve , I heard some body coming along , so I turn 'd my self about , and cry 'd , - who comes there ? The Prisoner , - ( I am almost sure , is the same Person ) he had a Cask upon his Back , and a Woman was with him . I asked him , what he had got there ? Damn thee ( says he ) what 's that to thee ? He pass 'd over to the other Side of the Way , and I call 'd out to the Deceased ; he asked me what was the Matter ; no Harm , says I , in the Name of God . When he came up to me , no Words in Anger pass 'd , for I told the Prisoner , tho ' he damn 'd me , I would not damn him : But when the Deceased came to my Assistance , the Woman fell back from the Prisoner , and I went after her about 6 or 7 Paces ; while I was pursuing her , my Partner cry 'd out , - O Lord , Watch ! Watch ! the Rogue has stabb 'd me ! I caught hold of the Woman , and told her I would secure her till we found the Prisoner ; and as I was carrying her to the Watch-house , I heard some body tripping after me , and turning round to see who follow 'd me , the Prisoner stabb 'd me in the Arm - I wish I was as sure of the Kingdom of Heaven , as I am that the Prisoner is the Man . Q . Did you or the Deceased give any Provocation ? Sturgeon . No ; there was not a'miss ( an amiss ) Word came out of our Mouths , nor any Provocation given , excepting , that we desired to know what he had upon his Back , at that Time of Night . Q . Did you see any Blow given by the Deceased ? Sturgeon . No ; the Deceased was not a quarrelsome Man ; I never heard any Harm of him in my Life ; I look 'd upon him to be a careful good Watchman . Prisoner . Please to let me send for Witnesses , to prove where I was all that Night . I was upon Guard all that Night . C. That 's an old Story , indeed . Mary Dubois . I am the Deceased 's Widow . On his Death-bed he declared , that as he was assisting this Watchman , he was stabbed by a Soldier with his Bayonet . He lived from Thursday Morning to Friday Night ; and before he dy 'd , he declar 'd the Prisoner had murder 'd him . Edward Edmunds , Surgeon . I was called up about half an Hour after One , to dress the Deceased 's Wound : I did not then imagine it was mortal ; but next Morning , about Nine , I found it was . After his Death , I open 'd the Body , and found the left Lobe of the Lungs was penetrated ; this occasion 'd a great Effusion of Blood , and was the Cause of his Death . Defence . I was on Guard that Night , and this Man here is my Corporal : I wanted to go home , so I satisfy 'd him , that I would come again upon Duty , about 10 or 11 . When I had been at home some Time , I told my Wife I must return to my Duty , but I promis 'd her , if I could get off , I would come home to Bed . She went down to the Guard-Room with me ; but the Corporal not being there , we went to King-Street to look for him ; and not 20 Yards from King-Street , a Man with a Pole , struck me down ; we fell to fighting , and another Man with a Lanthorn struck me ; but the Mob parted us , and I went about my Business , to the Fountain in King-Street , and there I drank 3 or 4 Pints of Beer with one Lamb , who work 'd with me at my Trade of Shoe-mending : I told him I had been fighting , and we went together to a Night-Cellar , and staid there till 4 o'Clock in the Morning . I have no Witnesses here , but my Lawyer told me this Paper would satisfy the Court 'till To-morrow . Edward Groom . The Prisoner is my Fellow Soldier . I did not see him upon Guard that Night after 10 or 11 o'Clock . I met him about 4 in the Morning in King-Street , but he had no Barrel on his Shoulders then : His Nose was bloody , and he had received a Blow between his Eyes : He said he had been fighting , but did not say with whom . I went with him to a Cellar at Charing-Cross , and there he swore , if it had not been for his Bayonet , he should have been murder 'd that Night ; and his Wife laughed and said , she believ 'd so too . The Corporal . The Prisoner belongs to the same Company with me : About 11 o'Clock at Night he came to the Guard-Room , and after that I saw him not , 'till almost 4 , at the upper end of King-Street . He drew his Bayonet , and told me , if it had not been for that , something would have attended him ; and his Wife smil 'd and said , Aye , so it would . Mary Brown . I lodged in the Prisoner 's House in Church-lane . On Jan. 14 he and his Wife went out at Night about Ten , and I did not hear him come home that Night . Next Morning , about Eight , I went into their Room , and asked them what Time they came home ; they told me , between 3 and 4 . I look 'd upon him , and saw a Cut cross his Nose : I asked him how it came ; he said , he was set upon by two Watchmen , and they were so resticall , that he was obliged to draw his Bayonet , and play away with it . A Woman . I lodged at the Prisoner 's House ; I am no Relation of his , - no , nothing at all : When the Prisoner was taken up , he deliver 'd the Key of the House to me . Well , - this Mrs. Brown , she did say , she could do for this Man , without he would procure her some Money ; but what she meant I can not tell . I went to Newgate to him , and told him what she did say . Well , - that is not all that I do know , he did say and make Answer , that this Woman did know nothing of him , and he was not afraid . Well , - this Woman she did go to Newgate , and she did say to him , with a Proviso he would produce Money , she would do for him ; and he did say and make Answer , his Substance was gone , and a Bed to lye upon in Newgate , would signify nothing to him . That 's all I do know . Guilty . Death . 22.

Feb 1 . The Counsel for the King having open 'd the Charge , the Witnesses were call 'd . Simon Perry . I have the Honour to attend the Lord Carpenter , as his Clerk , and was present when the Prisoner 's Examination was taken before him : It was read to him ; he own 'd it was true , and he set his Mark to it , and I saw my Lord Carpenter sign it . This is the Confession of the Prisoner . Middlesex . The Examination of Jeffery Murat , otherwise Morat , taken and acknowledged before the Right Honourable George Lord Carpenter , Feb 1 . 1736. `` Who confesseth , that he is a Servant to his `` Grace the Duke of Manchester ; that meeting `` the Day before with one Thomas a Shooe-Boy , `` before Five in the Evening , they continued together `` till Two in the Morning ; that they `` agreed to break open the House of the Marquis `` of Lindsey ; and that they got over the Garden `` Wall , opened a back Window , and unbolted `` the Shutters . That they got in and lay conceal 'd `` in the said House till Morning ; then `` they went up Stairs and open 'd a Beaufet , and `` stole from thence 2 Pair of Silver Buckles ; `` and in the Library , out of another Beaufet , `` they stole 2 Guineas . That afterwards they `` went down into the Kitchen , to take the `` Cloaths of Hannah Emberton , a Servant in the `` said House : But hearing her come in about `` 7 o'Clock , this Examinant hid himself , and `` afterwards knocked the said Hannah down with `` an Iron Poker ; then he took a Penknife , ( which `` he owns to be the same ) and endeavoured to `` cut her Throat , and gave her several Wounds ; `` that he attempted to make his Escape up the `` Chimney ; but before this , he took out of her `` Pocket Three-pence Half-penny . Hannah Emberton appeared , in a very weak Condition , and gave the following Evidence . I have known the Prisoner these five Years ; he was the Dutchess of Manchester 's Black . When I went in that Morning , and saw a Door broke , I was frighted ; but seeing the Study Door bolted , I thought to my self , Thank God they have got no further ; and came out of the Room with a little more Courage ; tho ' I was no got into the Hall , but he attack 'd me . I begg 'd he would lock me up in a Room and spare my Life , he commanded me to deliver up the Keys , and I gave them to him , but I desired him when he had done with them to throw them somewhere where they might be found again ; Oh ! says he , I must take Care of you and the Keys too : I begged him not to kill me , but shut me up in a Room ; he told me , He must kill me , and it would be quickly over ; we struggled together till I got to the Top of the Kitchen Stairs , and there he got me down and stabbed me , and cut my Hands sadly as I endeavoured to save myself . He cut me in the Throat in such a Manner , that the Surgeon said there was not a Hair 's Breadth between me and Death . He stabbed me before he knocked me down , and when he had knocked me down , he stood over me and whetted his Knife ; I begg 'd of him not to use it any more , and begg 'd God not to give him Leave ; he finding I was not dead , gave me five Blows with a Scrubbing-Brush , and after this perceiving there were some Life in me , he gave me as many more with the Brush ; then I lay for dead , and he took my Pockets off , and a Silk Handkerchief from about my Neck ; then he turned me over , and finding no Life in me he broke open the Cellar Door , I made shift to lift up my Hand and undo the Parlour Door , but I was so weak that my Head fell down , - thus . Q . What Time of the Morning was it when he first attacked you ? Mrs. Emberton . To the best of my Knowledge it was about eight or nine that he began with me , but he was butchering about me two Hours . When I had got in the Parlour , I broke one of the Squares in the Sash , and held out my bloody Hand and my bloody Hair . When I saw the People gathered about the Window , I broke down the Blind , and got out at the Window , and there I sat ; he certainly thought I was dead . I had only a Silver Thimble and some Half-pence in my Pocket . Q . Did you see any Body in the House but the Prisoner ? Mrs. Emberton . No , nobody besides himself . Thomas Roberts . Last Thursday was a Fortnight , I was going to Mr. Jennings , who lives next Door to the Marquis of Lindsey , and just as I was going to knock at the Door , I heard the Sash break ; I looked to see what was the Matter , and saw the Gentlewoman 's Bloody Hand , and she cry 'd , Murder ! By that Time I was got up to the House , she had opened the Sash and was going to tumble herself out of the Window ; I prevented her , and by the Help of some Chair-Men and their Poles , I got in at the Window and opened the Door . I could perceive where she had been abused upon the Ground , and at a little Distance from the Place , there lay an Iron Poker broke in Half , and the Penknife . We searched the House for the Prisoner , and we could not find him ; but in about an Hour and a half afterwards we found him in one of the Chimnies ; we flung Brickbats in at the Tops , and they did not fall through one of them , so we searched that Chimney , but he got out of that into another , and at last we smoaked him down with Straw ; then we searched him , and took the Buckles , the Thimble , and some Half-pence from him ; I think it was Three-pence Half-penny . My Lord Carpenter was sent for to examine him , but I did not stay to hear the Examination . Richard Wild , Chimney-Sweeper . I was standing at a Door in Grosvenor-Square , and the Gentlefolks called me in to search the Chimnies , I sent my Boys up , but they could not find him ; at last in a little Room at the Back of the Kitchen I found him in that Chimney , and I smoaked him down with straw , which we set on Fire at the Bottom ; when he came down the People surrounded him that I could not see him , but I know him very well , and am sure that is the Man . Guilty on all the Indictments . Death . 23. Mary Shrewsbury otherwise Threwsbury , was indicted for the Murder of her Male Bastard Child , by giving it a mortal Wound with a Knife in the Throat , of the Length of four Inches and the Depth of two Inches , of which it instantly died , Feb. 4 . She was a second Time indicted by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Mr. Bay . This Accident happened in Moorfields on Friday 7-night last , Application was made to me on Suspicion of a Murder . I being Overseer of the Poor , went to the House , and the People told me the Child was put down the Vault . I put a Guard in the House that Night , and the next Morning I brought a skillful Mid-wife ; we went up Stairs , and the poor Creature the Prisoner , was sitting upright in her Bed , with a Book in her Hand , and the Tears ran plentifully down her Face . There were five or six People in the Room , I asked them if they had searched the Room , they said they had ; then I went down and searched the Vault , but I found no more than what is common in such Cases . Then I ordered the Vault to be emptied , and there was nothing found , though the Contents were well examined . I desired the Midwife to go up and examine the Woman again , she did not care to go without the Beadle , so he went with her , and they searched the Room again , and found the Child in a Hole in the Closet . She owned what was done she did herself , and that this other Woman here only emptied the Pot , so the Justice discharged her because the Prisoner took it all on herself . Q . Were there any Marks of Violence on the Child ? Mr . Boy . Only the Head cut about half off . Ann Palmer , Midwife . The Parish Officer sent for me to examine the Prisoner ; I found she had been delivered of a Child ; when I enquired what she had done with it , she would make no direct Answer , but sat up in her Bed crying , with a Book in her Hand . I could get nothing out of her , but only , that what this Eliz . Bell had done , was by her Orders . I ask 'd her what Bell had done ; She would not tell me , but only desired I would be favourable , and Bell being gone away , I could not perswade her to tell me where she might be found . At last we found this Bell , and upon her Examination , she said she had put nothing down the Vault but the After-birth ; for says she , the Child she threw down there herself . I went to the Prisoner again , and told her that Bell had inform 'd us , that she ( the Prisoner ) had put the Child into the Vault : She own 'd she did so , and beg 'd I would be favourable in my Information , telling me , it was dead when she put it down . Well , says I , I hope you have not havock 'd it ; no , she said , she had not . Then the Vault was raked , and nothing found , but the After-burthen : Still she insisted upon it , that her Child was there ; upon which it was quite empty 'd , but no Child was found . I knew there must have been one born , so I search 'd again , with the Beadle and other Women , and I took her out of Bed in a Blanket , and search 'd the Bed , behind the Bed I found some Rags stain 'd , & c. & c. - at the Feet of the Bed , I found a Box with more Rags in the same Condition : I shook them all out , but found no Child : In another Box I saw something that put me upon enquiring , what she had been doing in it : She told me , she had only put some Cloaths in it . At last we search 'd the Closet , and in a Nook which ran into the Chimney , behind a small Trunk , we found it , sew 'd up in a Cloth ; when I pull 'd it out of the Hole , the Prisoner swoon 'd away . When she recover 'd , I asked her several Questions , - how she could cut her Child 's Throat so barbarously , and how she could in her present Condition have Strength to sew it up ? She said the Devil had given her Strength , and not God . The Lord have Mercy upon you , says I , and so I left her . Q . Was the Child 's Throat cut very much ? Palmer It could not be cut worse , unless it 's Head had been cut quite off . A Witness . This Bell was the Prisoner 's Land-lady , and seeing her come down with a Mop and a Pail from the Prisoner 's Room , I asked her what was the Matter ; she told me that Mary , ( the Prisoner ) was not well . I went up , and knock 'd at her Door , and she told me , the Key was under the Door ; I open 'd it and went in , and I ask 'd her what she ail 'd : I saw Spots of Blood upon the Floor , and I enquir 'd how they came there ; she said , she was as Women are , when they are disorder 'd , but , says she , my Landlady Bell is coming to wipe them up In the Closet I saw a Pan full of Cloths , not very fit to be seen ; - what 's all this Mary , says I ? God bless you , says she , do n't say any Thing , I have miscarry 'd and was three Months gone . I told her I was sorry for that , but however , I made her some hot Watergruel , and carry 'd it to her in Bed , and left her to eat it . When I was got down Stairs , I endeavoured to settle my self to my Work , but I was very uneasy in my Mind , and ( to make short of my Story ) I could not rest 'till I had made some farther Enquiry . I ask 'd her where she had put the Miscarriage , she told me that Bell had put it down the Vault . The Vault was search 'd , but it was not there . It was found at last in a Nook , that went into the Chimney : I was present when 't was pull 'd out , and according to my Judgement 't was at it 's full Growth . Midwife . 'T was at it 's full Growth ; it had Hair and Nails perfect , and was a larger Child than is common . Eliz Bell . I came home that Night about 10 o'Clock , and seeing a great deal of Blood upon the Floor , I asked the Prisoner how it came there ; she said , do n't be frighted , I have mis-carried , she desir 'd me to tell no Body , and beg 'd I would carry down the Pot . I got her some hot Ale , and then I went to Bed . C. You have behav 'd very ill in this Affair , and you deserve to be severely reprimanded . You saw all the Symptoms of the Woman 's being deliver 'd , and instead of making a Discovery , you ran out of the Way . Your Proceeding was very shameful , and I am afraid you are as much concern 'd in this Murder as the Prisoner her self , - Get you gone . Prisoner . It was dark when I was deliver 'd , and the Child was dead . Guilty . Death . 24. Charles Orchard , of St. George 's Middlesex , was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Elly , in the King 's Highway , putting her in Fear , & c. and taking from her 2 s. 5 d. Oct , 26 . Eliz . Elly . On the 26th of October , between 7 and 8 at Night , I went into a Shop over-against the Danes Church in Rag-Fair , for a Halt-penny Candle , and a half-pen'orth of Small Beer . The Prisoner stood in the Shop , and see me take 2 s. 5 d. in Change of a Half-Crown . There was two Fellows in Company with him , but I did not observe them to come near me : The Prisoner follow 'd me out of the Shop , with a Trowel in his Hand , and he knock 'd me down , and then struck me with his Trowel ; one of my Fingers was so chopp 'd , that I was obliged to go into the Hospital , and have it cut off . When he had me down , he took away the 2 s. 5 d. I am positive the Prisoner is the Man , for I observ 'd him in the Shop , with his Trowel , and there was a Lamp just by the Place where he attack 'd me . Q . How came the Prisoner to be taken ? Elly . I was coming by a Watch-house and saw him : I knew him , and challeng 'd him directly . George Holderness . I was drinking at the Standard in Rag-Fair , and one Harris told me he had receiv 'd Information concerning three Men , who had been robbing on the Highway : At his Request I went with him to search for them , at a House where Thieves are entertain 'd , by Well-street ; there we found the Prisoner , and three other Fellows . Q . How came you to suspect the Prisoner ? Holderness . Mr. Harris was directed there , and one of the Men made himself an Evidence against the rest . The Prisoner struggled when we took him , and fought , and would not go along , but after a few Blows were exchang 'd , we got him to the Justice 's , and the other Man informing against the Prisoner for House-breaking , he was committed to Newgate . When we had got him to Jail , he desired me to call upon him , after I had lodged the Evidence in New Prison : I did so , and he begg 'd I would desire Justice Farmer to permit him to be an Evidence , for says he , I can hang five Men , and can knock down the other Evidence , because he has not put all the Robberies in his Information , that I was concern 'd in : I committed a Robbery says he , between Rag-Fair and the Tripe-house , and he has mentioned nothing of that . James Warrener . To prevent Harris 's appearing against the Prisoner , they have got a Woman to swear the Peace against him , and have taken him into Custody . The Prisoner was brought before Justice Farmer the 27th of Jan . I am his Clerk . This is an Information ( producing a Paper ) against the Prisoner for breaking open a House in Ratcliffs Highway . He confess 'd he robb 'd this Woman , and he fell down upon his Knees and ask 'd her Pardon : he own 'd he robb 'd her , and chopp 'd off her Finger with his Trowel , and he produc 'd the Trowel at the same Time : The Woman knew him again , and this is the Trowel , I can swear to it . Prisoner . She told her Landlady , that she fell down and cut her Finger with the Pitcher : All these People swear only for the sake of the Reward . Guilty . Death . 25.

I went out about 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon , to buy some Meat of Mr. Neal at Wapping , and left my House safe , both Windows and Doors were fast : When I came Home , I found my House broke open ; suspecting the Prisoner , I pursu 'd him directly , and I found him in a Goldsmith 's House , and all the Goods upon him . This was on Saturday before last , the same Night that he commited the Fact . Q . How came you to find out the Goldsmith ? Cook . I had been pursuing the Prisoner , and not finding him , was returning Home ; but I was stopp 'd , and told that the Gentleman ( the Gold-smith ) had sent for me , and that he had stopp 'd my Man with the Goods upon him . I live at Blackwall , and the Prisoner was my Apprentice ; he was bound to me , no longer ago than last Wednesday was a Month . Jonah Walker . The Prisoner at the Bar brought all this Plate to my Shop , and asked me to buy it . Q . When was it ? - What Day of the Month ? Walker . It was the Saturday before last , about 6 o'Clock in the Evening , he came into my Shop with this Tankard ( bruised in this Manner ) in his Hand ; I asked him his Name , he told me first his Name was Taylor , then he said it was Cook , and a Boy going by , told me that the Prisoner lived with one Mr. Cook , at Blackwall , so I sent a Porter to fetch him , and he owned all the Plate . The Prisoner had nothing to say in his Defence . Guilty . Death . Charles Orchard , was a second Time indicted for breaking and entering the House of Philip Lermit , and stealing a Fustian Coat , a Fustian Waistcoat , three Frize Coats , three Frize Jackets , sixteen Yards of Frize , five Yards and a half of German Serge , and nine Yards of Flannel Baize , in the Night-Time , January 10 .

And Elizabeth Sutton otherwise Goodman , for receiving the Watch , knowing it to be stole . Mr. Gearing . On Thursday the 28th of Oct . I was coming Home about half an Hour past 9 , and on the East Side of Soho Square , I was stopped by two Fellows , one of them seized me by the Collar , and the other stood on my left Side , they bid me make no Noise but deliver . I had two Purses in my Pocket , one of them was given me the Day before , and I had a Value for it , they took that from me , but as they were going off , I called to one of them ( whom I am informed was Bob the Glazier ) to return it me again ; he stopped to give it me ; upon this his Companion , whom I take to be the Prisoner , cry 'd ; Damn him , - stab him , then they both run away . I pursued them a little Way , but finding it dark and dirty I gave over , flattering myself that my Watch was safe , but it was gone . I ca n't swear to the Prisoner 's Face , but from the Size of the Man and his outward Appearance , I verily believe him to be the same . I never had any of my Goods again . Margaret Ryley . I live in James-street , Covent-Garden , at an Alehouse ; I remember that the Prisoner and Bob the Glazier , was at the House that Night , and had no Money , but they went out and returned again about eleven o'Clock , and called for two Pots of Beer and Ale ; I drank with them , and they asked me to pawn the Watch ; I told them I did not know where to pawn it , so he and Bob the Glazier pawn 'd it at one Bob Fields at Cow-Cross , and afterwards the two Prisoners redeemed it , and they both went over to Holland to dispose of it . Last Sunday I met the Prisoner Goodman in Short's-Garden , and he asked me to drink , telling me he could have lived like a Man in Holland , if he had not carried the Woman-Prisoner with him . He said he got fourteen Guineas for the Watch in Holland , and by his own Description of the Gentleman he took it from , I knew the Prosecutor to be the Person that was robbed , as soon as I saw him . Sam Goodman . I know nothing at all of the Matter , I do n't upon my Word , my Lord , I know that Margaret Riley , she is a common Whore , and lives in common Bawdy-houses . I happen 'd , 't is true , to be in Trouble with Sutton , who was cast here for his Life , and I was taken up with him before , and when he return 'd from Transportation , I went to Holland . I intended to have gone Cooper 's Mate in the Lethieulier an India Ship , but the Ship had got all it 's Hands aboard . A Witness . ( The Prisoner 's Brother . ) The Prisoner is a Cooper by Trade and worked with me . I deal in Cyder and Dorchester Beer ; he kept Company with Sutton , and when Sutton returned from Transportation I got rid of him as fast as I could , and he got himself a Ship and went over to Holland , for as he was taken up for a Robbery with Sutton before , so now they take him up whenever they please . Samuel Goodman . This Woman that stands by me at the Bar , is my Wife . Thomas Taylor . And she is George Sutton 's Wife too . Prisoner 's Brother . I deal for some Thousand Pounds a Year in Cyder and Dorchester Beer . I paid all this Money to the King this very Morning : - Please to look at these Papers . C. You may deal for a great deal of Money , and be never the honester at last . Prisoner Goodman . I shall call some Persons to my good Character now . C. Aye ! and perhaps they 'll be such Persons as stand by you . A Woman . I have known him six or seven Years . C. And does he live with you , or do you live with him , Witness . No , - I knew him when he worked at his Brother 's , and he came of an honest Family . C. That may be , and he never the better . Witness . But he has been backward and forward in the House , and I have something of Value about me , yet he never wronged me . A Justice of the Peace . The Prisoner Goodman has been an Evidence in this very Court . I committed him with Beezly and Sutton ; he was try 'd with Sutton , when Sutton was convicted . I know him to be a very vile Fellow . Margaret Riley . I never saw the Prosecutor , 'till I came to Mr. De Veil 's ; and the Minute I came in , I said , - this is the Gentleman , by Goodman 's and Bob the Glasier 's Description . They told me he was a very little Gentleman , and had vastly much the Look of a Jew . They told me , after they had robb 'd him in Soho square , they were afraid he would have follow 'd them ; and that they watch 'd him into his own House . Goodman was the first that attack 'd him ; he gave Bob the Glasier the Gentleman 's Purse , and Bob stole out some of the Guineas unknown to Goodman , and put in some Shillings instead of them . Goodman found out the Trick , and resolved to redeem the Watch unknown to Bob : So meeting with the Prisoner Bess , away they went with it to Holland together . Both Acquitted . 28.

Philip Dwyer , and Bryan Macgrass , were indicted for feloniously procuring Richard Murphey , a Subject of our Lord the King , to enlist and enter himself into the Service of the French King , being a Foreign Prince , without the leave of our present Lord the King under his Sign Manual first had and obtained , Feb. 2 . The Counsel for the King having opened the Indictment and the Evidence , the Witnesses were called . Richard Murphey I was born in Ireland , and have been about 3 Years in England . In January last , I came in Company with the Prisoner Dwyer , being introduced to him by some of his Partners . Counsel . Who brought you acquainted with them ? Murphey . One William Clark . I met them first at the Rising Sun in Duke Street , by Lincoln's-Inn-Fields . I went there to enquire for one Serjeant Archdeacon , by William Clark 's Direction , but he was gone the Night before , with fifteen Recruits for France . Clark met me there , and he told me that I should have come the Night before , and that I had lost my Passage this Time : But if I design 'd to go , I must come by and by ; for there would be a Gentlemen there again , who would tell me what I must do . Councel . What pass 'd when you came in Company with Dwyer first ? Murphey . Clark 's Brother said , there was a Man would direct me what to do ; so I ask 'd Dwyer where Archdeacon was , he told me , he went away last Night , and that I should have come then . I told him my Cloaths were in Pawn ; that I was in Debt , and could not come without my Things I told him I had an Uncle in France , who was a Priest , and if I went over , he would redeem me , says he , there is no Occasion of Redemption , for if you have a Friend there , you may have your Liberty . As for your Cloaths , says he , there 's no such Thing as having them redeem 'd by me , for I was once very ill us 'd about some Cloaths that I got out of Pawn for a Man , and was forced to make my Escape thro ' a Coffee-House Then we talked of the Pay , and I was to have ( he said ) Seven Pence Half-penny a Day . Councel . Whose Service was you to go into , - the King of France 's ? Murphey . I was to go to Dunkirk , and was to have Seven Pence Half penny a Day . After this Mr. Macmillan came in , and he sat himself down to hear what pass 'd . Dwyer told me , I was too low for the Service , and that when there was no War , they took no Men under his ( Dwyer 's ) Size ; but Macmillan said , I wore a low Shoe , when he wears other Shoes he 'll do very well . Councel . So if you wore high heel 'd Shoes , they were to make a Man of you . Did you see the Prisoner Macgrass at that Time ? Murphey . Not at that Time ; but afterward I did . They agreed to send my Cloaths after me , and Mr Brettle said , I should get a Note from them to that Purpose . They were pawned in my Name , but before I went abroad , they were to be left in Clark 's Name ; he was labouring to delude more People into the Service of France . Councel Was any Thing sign 'd between you ? Murphey . Not at that Time . We had several Meetings together after this ; and to one of them the Prisoner Dwyer brought his Captain ; they call 'd him Captain Linderkin , this was at the Crown in Short 's Gardens , and Will . Clark and the Prisoner Macgrass were present . Councel . I ask you if there was any Agreement drawn in Writing at that Time ? Murphey . Yes ; there was a Note wrote by Dwyer , and Clark , and Macgrass sign 'd it . This is the Note sure enough , and Bryan , Macgrass , and William Clark signed it , at the present ( same ) Time . I saw Dwyer write it , and I desired Macgrass to sign it ; he said he suppos 'd 't was no Harm , and so he did sign it . - I am sorry he was concern 'd in it , because I believe he was innocent , - only he knew on what Account my Cloaths were to be redeem 'd , the Day before the Note was made . Councel . Then how can you say you believe him innocent ? Murphey . Because he never propos 'd any Thing at all to me about the Affair . Coun . Pris . This Note is said to be a Promissory Note , and 't is in the Singular Number , - my Objection is , that two Men have sign 'd it . The Note was read , A Suit of Cloaths , a pair of Silver Buckles , the Goods of Richard Murphey , now at the Pawnbrokers , and alter 'd into William Clark 's Name , to be deliver 'd free of all Charges , on the Agreement between him and Philip Dwyer . Councel . So they would not venture to mention what that Agreement was . Did you go to the Pawnbrokers to alter the Name , in which the Cloaths were pawn 'd ? Murphey . Yes , Dwyer and Macgrass , and Will . Clark went with me , and the Name was changed : Clark wrote his Name upon a bit of Card , and the Pawnbroker put it upon my Cloaths . Councel . What was the Agreement mention 'd in that Paper ? Murphey . To procure a Man or two for him . Councel . Was Macgrass present at any Time when Dwyer and you talk 'd about your being enlisted ? Murphey . Yes , the Day before he was taken , and then Dwyer told Macgrass , that this young Man ( meaning me ) had a Design to go abroad ; but , said he , Times are hard upon him , - his Cloaths are in Pawn , and he will have Security they shall be sent him ; and he desired me to pronounce the Agreement , made between him and me . Macgrass was his Friend ( at present ) and he bid me tell him the Agreement we were upon ; so I told Macgrass what I had propos 'd about my Cloaths . Councel . What was you to do in France ? Murphey . I was to procure a Man or two , or to pay for my Cloaths , when they came to me . Councel . Was there any mention made of what you were to do ? Murphey . I was to pass Muster for a Friend , in Buckley 's Regiment . Councel . You talk 'd of Seven-pence Half-penny a Day ; what was you to have that Pay for ? Murphey . To serve like another Man . Councel . Was you to serve as a Soldier , or was you not ? Murphey . I did not go so tight upon them , - they told me I was to have Seven-pence Half-penny a Day . Councel . Was not you to do a private Soldier 's Duty ? Murphey . They told me I might pay for a Soldier when I came there , and might work at my Trade every Day . Councel . So he told you , if you could get any Body to muster for you , you might follow your own Business ? Murphey . Yes , Sir , when he wrote the Note about the Cloaths , he told every Thing I was to do ; and I told him , - I do n't expect to be serv 'd but like a common Soldier : Friends we met ( says I ) and Friends we 'll part . He told me he had good Friends abroad , and when I was got to France , he would give me two Holland Shirts . Councel I would ask you this Question , - Was you to go there to be hired as a Soldier , with encouragement , that when you came there , you might get some body to appear for you in the Regiment as a Soldier , or was you to go over and appear for some body else ? Murphey . I was to appear for my self ; but they said I might follow my Business Councel . Pray mind the Question . Was you to go over and appear for any body else , or was you to go as a Soldier your self ? and if you had any Occasion to be absent , you might have some body to Muster for you . Murphey . I might have any body to appear in a Muster for me . Dwyer said , he would not enlist me ; but I said , I desir 'd to be serv 'd as other Men , or else I would part with him : So he told me , I might pass Muster , and follow my Trade too . Councel . Did Macgrass hear all this ? Murphey . I believe not . Macgrass desired me to propose what I was upon ; so I told him all . Councel . What did you tell him ? Murphey . I told him I would procure a Man or two , and so get my Cloaths clear ; and I shew 'd them one Man , and I told them , I would get another when I got to France : For it I could not get one or two Men to enlist in the Regiment , I was to pay for my Cloaths and my Passage when I got to France . Councel . And was it not mention 'd to you , that if you could not get a Man or two , you was to stay there yourself ? Murphey . That was not mention 'd . Councel . Why what was you to have 7 Pence Half-penny a Day for ? Murphey . They told me I might follow my Trade , and get a Man to pass Muster for me in Case of Necessity . Macgrass was not present when Dwyer and I had all this Discourse . All the Concern he had in this Affair , was in Short 's Gardens , when the Agreement was reduced to Writing , and he signed it . Andrew Macmillon . I was present at the Rising-Sun by the Romish Chapel in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields , when Dwyer and Murphey were there . I was not one of their Company , they were at a Table , and I was by the Fire Side . I heard what they were upon , so I told one Mr. Brettle . - Councel . What did Dwyer say to Murphey ? Macmillon . I got Brettle to go with me to the Rising-Sun , so we sat down , and I took up a News-Paper ( the Penny-Post ) and that they might not think I minded them , I seemed Intent upon the Paper . I heard Dwyer say , Why did not you come Yesterday at Five o'Clock ? Murphey said , How could I come without Cloaths ? Dwyer said , They would have been sent after him . Murphey told him , He would have Security that he should have them before he went ; and they talked a good deal in Irish , that I could not understand . At last I said , If the Man is going out of the Kingdom , it is not proper he should leave his Cloaths behind him , if he could take them with him . Aye ! but , said Dwyer , he 'll have Seven-Pence Half-penny a Day when he comes there . I heard them talk about his Landing somewhere about Calais , and about his Pay , but I heard nothing of what he was to do for it . Thomas Bonniface , Constable . When I went to take the Prisoner Dwyer , I attempted to search him , and he pulled out a Paper from his Pocket and put it into the Fire ; I endeavoured to take it out of the Fire , and as my Hand was upon the Paper , he set his Foot upon it and burnt my Hand , but with much Difficulty we saved it . Macgrass was taken at the same Time , but we found nothing upon him . James Brettle . I was present when the Prisoners were taken . Murphey told me that Dwyer had the French King 's Authority about him for enlisting Men , and he said , if we searched him , we should find it . We had Mr. Ibbot the Messenger with us when they were taken . We carried them to Mr. Hodges 's , the Corner of Short's-Gardens . Ibbot searched Macgrass , and the Constable searched Dwyer . While he was searching Dwyer , he ( Dwyer ) pulled a Paper out of his Pocket and put it into the Fire , the Constable went to take it out , and he set his Foot upon the Constable 's Hand and held it down in the Fire , but I drew my Hanger and made the Constable take it out . That 's the Paper , it is burnt a little , and it was preserved with Difficulty . The Paper was wrote in French , but in English it runs as follows. `` The Irish Regiment of Buckley . Soldiers `` Furloe . We who have undersigned , to all , `` unto whom it may appertain , we have given `` Leave to Philip Dwyer , a Voluntier in the Colonel 's `` Company in Buckley 's Regiment , to go `` to England for 6 Months , to recruit for the `` said Colonel 's Company . The said Dwyer `` was born in Tipperary , aged 43 Years , five `` Feet five Inches high , Chesnut colour 'd Hair , `` Blue Eyes , short Nose , and good Legs . Signed . Macgray , Capt . Lieut . Dated at Avence , Counter-sign 'd . Macheire , Major . Oct. 12 , 1736 . Approv 'd and sign 'd . Henezie , Lieut . Col . Enter 'd . Dettez , Commissary of War . Dwyer . I never agreed with him about any Money : I told him there was but little for his Pay , and he said he had some skill in the Irish Character , and would improve himself in France . I was sick when this Furloe was given , 't is a Soldier 's Ease ; and when I was seized , I happen 'd to burn the Paper in a surprize , thinking it would do me harm . A Juryman . We would know whether the giving and receiving of Money , is absolutely necessary to the enlisting of Men ? Mr. De Veil . No ; Voluntiers are enlisted every Day , without a Farthing of Money ; and when they have had the Act read to them , and the Articles of War , and they assent to them before a Magistrate , they are to all Intents and Purposes , as much Soldiers , as if they had received a Thousand Pounds . Reading the Act , and assenting to the Articles before a Magistrate , can not be done in such Cases as these , where Persons enlist for Foreign Service . Both acquitted . 37.

Between 2 and 3 in the Morning , Feb 5. the Watchmen call 'd me up , and told me my House was broke open ; several of my Pales in the Yard was pull 'd down , and the Back Door of my House was forc 'd open . The Rogues when they had got into my Yard , took out some Glass from a Window near the Door , and I suppose they put their Hands in and unbolted the upper Bolt , and the bottom Bolt they wrenched off , and the Batten of the Door likewise . They took the Things mention 'd in the Indictment . We found 5 of my Plates that very Night in Bullock's-Court , which is next my House , and the Prisoner was taken the same Time . Zachariah Newman . I was at my Stand , and hearing a rattling of Pewter , I went over to see what it was , and met the Prisoner coming out of the Court , he pass 'd me , and after he was gone , I pick 'd up 5 Pewter Dishes ; I carried them to the Watch-house , and took out some Assistance with me to make a farther Discovery . We left our Candles and Lanthorns at the Watch-house , and waited at the Place where the Pales were broke , in about an Hour the Prisoner came to the very Place , and we took him . He was carry 'd to the Counter that Night , and next Morning we had him before Sir Richard Brocas , and there he own 'd that he and another committed this Robbery . I was present when he confess 'd that he got into the Yard , then broke open the Door , and handed out the Pewter and the Things into Bullock 's Yard . Thomas Sorrel . I was the Man that Newman called to his Assistance , and when the Prisoner came up the Court the second Time , Newman telling me that was the Man that came from the Place where we found the Pewter before , I seized him , he told us there was one Harrison concerned with him , but we could not find him . It was not before Sir Richard Brocas himself that he confessed the Fact , but in Sir Richard 's Shop , before his Footman , the Shop-Man , and us . Ann Hornby . I fasten 'd all the Doors , the last Thing I did , before I went to Bed . John Peat is my Name all the World over . This Man , here , came to the Watch-house , and says he , - Peat , I want a Hand ; I lent him a Hand , and they went out without their Lanthorns ; and in about half an Hour afterwards they caught the Gentleman : He did the Fact , ( by Report ) but he said there was another with him , - as brave a Thief as any is in England . The Prisoner was mighty Obstrepolous , and I was forced to punch him on the Stomach to make him civil - like an old Soldier , - I have no more to say , - but have done - all at once . Prisoner . I was going to my Father with the Keys of our Door , and wanting to make Water , I stepped up Bullock 's Yard , and there the Watchmen took me . They told me if I could say any Thing about Harrison , they would let me go . John Hider , Thomas Driver , and John Pattison , never knew any Hurt of him . Ann Turner . I am his Mother , I sent him out that Night to see for his Father . - I work for most of the Gentry about Tower Hill and Savage-Gardens .

Susan Higgins , was indicted for stealing a Canvas Bag , value 4 d. and 8 Half Guineas , and 5 l 16 s the Property of James Bannister , in the House of Joanna Worthington , Jan. 9 . James Bannister . About 5 Weeks ago , I went to Worthington 's ( this old Woman 's ) House to enquire for Mr. Hinton a Printer ; I waited for him till 11 at Night , then I fell asleep ; the old Woman asked me to go to Bed ; I did , and in the Morning , when I got up , all my Money was gone . I told my Landlady I had been robb 'd , - Lord , says she , I have kept House 40 Years and never any such Thing happen 'd before . She told me , she had let the Prisoner in about 12 o'Clock , and she would examine her . While I was contesting with the old Woman , the Prisoner came in very drunk , but we got her to sleep , and she awaked and was come to herself , she told us she had the Money , and that she took it for Funn , but if I would be good natur 'd I should have some of it again . I pallaver 'd with her , and at last she said the Money was in the Hands of St. James 's Watch-house Keeper , so she and I went to him ; he asked me who I was ? With a very reverend Bow , - I said , - with Submission , you have Money of mine in your Hands ; he deny 'd it , and order 'd me to be put out of the Watchhouse : Well says I to the Prisoner , you said you took it for Funn , you shall go along with me for Funn , and so I pull 'd her away with me , and got a Constable ; he search 'd her and found the Purse upon her . She told Justice Lambert that I gave it her , but in the Round-house she said that Col. Turner gave it her . Prisoner . Ask him what Woman that was that was a Bed with him at my Landlady 's ? I am an unhappy Woman 't is true , but I never pick 'd a Pocket in my Life . Joanna Worthington . The Prosecutor came in that Night and asked for Mr. Hinton , he was not at Home , so he sat down to wait his coming in , and falling asleep I asked him to go Bed , and he did so . This Prisoner was foul , and she was with me upon Cure ; I take in sick People ; the Woman to be sure is a vile Creature in her Way , - when she was well , could not she have made use of her own Way of Living again , without robbing the Man ? She came Home fuddled two Hours after he was gone to bed , and there being never a Lock upon the Prosecutor 's Door , and her Chamber being upon the same Floor with his , I charged her to go up softly . In the Morning he told me he was robbed , I bid him make himself easy , I should hear of it again ; while he was disputing with me , in comes Madam with a Man with her ; we taxed her with the Money , and under Pretence of helping us to it again , she led us from Bagnio to Bagnio , the Lord knows where ; she was in Liquor indeed , but we brought her Home and made her lye down , and when she awaked , I said , how could you do such a Thing in my House , - I that have done you such Service in curing you and making you right again ! Why , says she , I did it for Funn , and if he 'll be very civil I 'll get him two Guineas and a Half again , but if he is saucy he shall have none . About five or six o'Clock we went to the Watchman at St. James 's that had the Money ; he turned us out of the Watch-house , but the Prosecutor got hold of the Prisoner and pulled her out , she took hold of me , and so I was tumbled into the Kennel among them , but I got out again like a Cat ; then we got a Constable and searched the Prisoner , and found the Bag upon her , and then we returned to the Watch-house Keeper , and he owned he had received five Guineas and a Half from the Prisoner , which he gave us back again . Prisoner . Pray ask him whether the Money that Wingfield the Beadle returned him , - whether the Prosecutor did not give it me , - and ask him for what ? Bannister . I never saw her till after my Money was gone . Catherine Hinton . I lodge at Worthington 's , my Husband and I came Home about twelve , the Prosecutor was a-bed , and Kitty Nichols ( that is one of the Prisoner 's Names ) was not come in We went to bed , and in the Morning the Man said he was robbed , and that he had lost 8 Guineas and some Silver . The Prisoner came in soon after very much fuddled , and she said she took his Money for Funn , and if he 'd be civil , perhaps she 'd give him a couple of Guineas again . Prisoner . Ask the Witness how she came acquainted with that Man - She 's a very disorderly Woman . Hinton . I knew him when he drove the Stage Coach for Mr. Baldwin of Slough . Defence . The Prosecutor came into this old Woman 's House , and ask 'd for a Woman , and for something to drink ; Mrs Hinton brought him some Brandy or Gin - so he drank to me , and I to him ; then we went up Stairs together for about an Hour ; and I leave it to you to guess what we did there . He liked me so well , that he said he would come again , and make me a handsome Present ; for , says he , 't is Pity you should live in this old Bawd 's House . I will keep you at Kensington . So the Thursday Night following he came again , and lay with me all Night ; but on Sunday Night he got to Bed to another Lady of this old Woman 's Family , and it made me so angry , that I pull 'd off the Bed-cloaths ; and he desired me to be quiet - he would oblige me too . I would not let him , but was still very angry : So he pull 'd out the Purse and gave it me , not to make a Noise about the other Girl , and I carry 'd it directly to Wingfield the Beadle . This old Woman keeps a notorious Bawdy-house ; and ever since I have known her I have been miserable . Worthington . I took her in foul , and cur 'd her , as I do many of these poor Wretches ; and I do it for never a Farthing ; and when they are well , if they will go to Service , - they 're welcome . C. I am afraid you are the Occasion of these Wretches being in such unhappy Circumstances . Jury . Where does the old Woman live ? A Witness . On the Backside of St. Clement 's Church . Guilty 4 s 10 d.

Last Sunday Night , this Gentleman and I was coming past the Two Blue-Posts at Temple-Bar , and the Prisoner ask 'd us to give her a Pint of Wine . We went into the House with her , and when we had finish 'd the Wine , she and I went into another Room ; when we had done our Business , we return 'd to the Room where we had left the Gentleman . She was no sooner enter 'd , but she said she wanted to speak with the Drawer , and away she ran smartly thro ' the House , and the Door was shut upon her . I had my Watch when I went in , and when I came out I miss 'd it . The Case was found afterwards under the Table . I lodge in Bell-yard , and went to my Lodging about a quarter of an Hour after she ran out of the Tavern , and then it was I miss 'd it . Dillon Wye . Confirm 'd the above Evidence ; adding , that he saw the Prosecutor playing with the String of his Watch before he retired with the Prisoner , and that he thought a Lady in her Garb would not have done such a Thing . Mr. Rogers . I went back to the Tavern to enquire for the Woman the same Night , and I told them I had lost my Watch , but the Doors were shut , and they would not let me come in . Nathaniel Manning . The Gentleman came on Monday to enquire for his Watch ; and after he was gone , I found the Case in the Feathers , that was the Room they went first into . I shew 'd him where the Prisoner liv 'd in Chancery-Lane . Philip Williams . I drew the Wine , and carry 'd it into two separate Rooms . They both came in together with the Lady , and they stay 'd about a Quarter of an Hour ; she came out , and went thro ' the House very briskly , about six Minutes after they came out of the private Room , and our Cook shut the Door after her . When they paid the Reckoning they said nothing about what they had lost ; but one of them return 'd in about half an Hour , and knock 'd at the Door , my Master was ill , and he order 'd the Door not to be open 'd any more that Night . Next Morning my Fellow Servant shew 'd him the Lady 's Lodgings in Chancery-Lane , and gave him the Case that was found under the Table . Prisoner . At Temple-Bar I met these Gentlemen , and went into the Tavern with them ; we drank a Glass a-piece , and then I went with the Prosecutor into another Room , and we had a Pint of Wine there . While we were in this Room together , he call 'd the Drawer , and bid him go into the other Room , and ask the Gentleman if he had got his Snuff-box ; the Gentleman sent Word he had it not ; well then , says he , I have left it at the Fountain , where I supp 'd to Night . They kept me 'till between 11 and 12 , and he drew his Sword , and said , if I offer 'd to go out of the Room he would run me thro ' , and getting up to take hold of me , he fell down , for he was pretty much fuddled , and so I got out of the House , and I heard no more 'till next Night the Prosecutor came with two or three Men and took me out of my Bed . Mr. Rogers . I was there twice on Monday , and she denied her self . Betty Pyke and William Vizard , never heard of her being a Thief . Nanny Millan . I have known her three Years , she is a Mantua-maker , I work 'd for her , and never heard any Thing dishonest of her . Councel . Have not you heard of her being more Trades than one ?

In September Sessions I was tried here for two Robberies , on a Woman I was acquainted with , and Drinkwater was a Witness at the Trial . ^ Vide Sessions-Paper , Numb . 7. p. 180 . 1736 . Drinkwater . This Warwick was found guilty of conspiring against my Life , last Sessions , and for the same stood in the Pillory , - a little while . Warwick . On my Trial for these Robberies in September , I desired my Councel to ask Drinkwater , whether he had not declar 'd he would hang me . I saw him sworn ; and when the Question was ask 'd him , he made Answer , - no , I only said , I would bring him to Justice . After he had given Evidence he was sent to Newgate - Drinkwater . What was it for ? Warwick . I call 'd Mr. Cook to prove he had said the Words , and he was order 'd into Custody , and was taken into the Baledock , and there he bawl 'd out , - my Lord ! my Lord ! - Pray my Lord ! pray my Lord ! Joseph Cook . About Midsummer last I saw Drinkwater , and he asked me when I saw Jack Warwick , I told him I had not seen him a pretty while , he 's in the Country , says I ; I have been in Jail , says he , eleven Months , and my Head and Pen have been at work ; if I can find him , I will hang him ; if I ca n't hang him , I 'll transport him ; if I do n't do neither of them , I 'll imprison the Dog for Life . I believe I might say , - what 's the Occasion of your being in Goal ? And he said , - no Matter , I have it all in my Book . C. Was you acquainted with Warwick ? Cook . Yes , I have been acquainted with him about three or four Years . I took a Lease of some Ground from the Countess of Southampton , and Warwick had a Mind to a Bit of this Ground to build upon , and he appearing well I let him a Bit of Ground . George Thompson . The Prisoner Drinkwater was at my House in Spaw-Fields last Summer , and Mr. Cook was looking over his Pales into my Yard , and he asked Cook when he saw his Friend Warwick . Cook told him that Warwick and he had fallen out , and that he was gone into the Country . I wish I could find him , says Drinkwater , I have been barbarously used by him in Jail , and if I can catch him , I will either hang him , or transport him , or keep him in Jail for Life . Councel . I desire Warwick 's Indictment , with the short Minutes on it , may be read ; what the Issue was , and the Verdict . Then the Record of Warwick 's Conviction and Judgment against him was read . John Wilkinson . I saw Warwick tried on that Bill of Indictment , he was upon Trial convicted and ordered to be set in the Pillory . Councel . We can shew this by more Witnesses , but I believe nobody doubts it . C. Now the Evidence that Warwick has given , is to be of no Weight ; no more Regard is to be paid to it , than if he had given no Evidence at all . Warwick . If I have been proved a Villain , he has been ten times as big . Councel . Aye ! but you are the Largest Man . Warwick . He is as bad a Rogue as myself , though I have stood in the Pillory . Drinkwater . He did not stand Half his Time . Warwick . I was forced to jump out to save my Life , that Bull-fac 'd Fellow there had got a Mob , and they threw Stones and Brickbats . I have a Hole in my Leg you may turn your Fingers in , made with a Brickbat ; and my Arm has since been laid open . C. Offenders are to suffer the Judgment of the Law , and their Punishment is not to be extended farther ; whoever is concerned in Outrages of this Nature , are liable to the Censure of this Court .

I was present at this Trial of James Jackson and Richard Ealey , but I did not see Holland sworn . Mr. Salt . Holland was sworn upon the Holy Gospel , to speak the Truth , the whole Truth , and nothing but the Truth . Leaf . Holland 's Evidence ( to the best of my Knowledge ) was this , that he was in Company with James Jackson and Richard Ealey , the 3d of May , that he went with them into the House or Shop of Henry Nown before mentioned ; that he was at the Top of the Stairs ( the One Pair of Stairs I think it was ) and that there was no Assault committed on Elizabeth the Daughter of Henry Nown , or something to that Effect . Councel How came you to attend there ? Are you an Attorney ? Leaf . No , I attend my Master 's Messages . Councel . Was you within the Bar or without ? Leaf . Without . Councel . How come you to remember this ? Leaf . Because this Man gave the last Evidence . Councel . And do you swear that because he gave his Evidence last , therefore you remember it ? Leaf . No Councel . Did you take Notes at that Trial ? Leaf . No . C. Are you sure that he swore he was there all the while ? Leaf . To the best of my Knowledge he did . - I had rather speak to the best of my Knowledge , - that will be Truth . C. Did he say positively that there was no Assault committed , or did he only say , he saw none committed ? Leaf . I wo n't take upon me to say which . Councel . Have you never declared that the Prosecutrix attempted to hire you to rap , as they term it ? Leaf . I do n't know that ever I did . Mr. Salt . I reduced the Words into Writing : they were , - That he was in Company with Jackson and Ealey the 3d of May , at the dwelling House of Richard Nown ; that he went with them to the Top of the first pair of Stairs , and that James Jackson did not make any Assault on the Person of Elizabeth Nown . Councel . Was this reduced into writing the same Day or the next . Mr. Salt . I ca n't tell that . It was not done in Court . Councel .

Were they out of your Sight , while they were in the House ? Goode . No , Sir , Mary Nown . On the 3d of May , Jackson came into my House and said he had a Warrant of Distress for 20 s. and you Bitch , says he , I will send you to Newgate and your Husband to Jayl : he was pretty hot , and been warming himself before he came in ; my Child said , for Christ 's Sake , do n't send them to Newgate , - send me instead of them . Holland ( upon the Trial of this Assault , ) said he was in my House , in Company with Jackson and Ealey , that he went up Stairs with them into a dark Entry , and that they never touch 'd the Door , nor my Daughter neither : and that they were not there two Minutes , if he had had a Watch . I desired Sarah Goode to go up Stairs and see what they were doing , and she followed them up immediately .

The 3d of May , Jackson and Ealey came and said they would go up Stairs , and take what they could find : Jackson went up first , and Ealey followed him , and the other Woman followed them . Jackson used me ill , - by ill Language , and the Kitchen Door being shut , he said I had got the Keys , and he took me by the right Side of the Petticoat and tore it . Holland was neither in the House nor up Stairs there was no Man up the Stairs save Jackson and Ealey . Defence . Mr. Jackson . In May last , I was Church-Warden of St. Mary-Hall .
