Sarah Allen , was indicted , for that she Oct. 6 . being big with a certain Male Child , in the Dwelling House of John Fryar , in the Parish of St. Gile 's in the Fields , the said Child she did bring forth alive , which Child so born , was a Bastard by the Laws of this Realm ; and she not having God before her Eyes , & c. - on the said Bastard Child as soon as it was born , did make an Assault , and being in a certain Garret three Stories high , with both her Hands , she the aforesaid Bastard Child did cast and throw down from the Window , to and against a certain Stone Pavement in the Street , giving it , by such casting and throwing down , a mortal Bruise on the back part of the Head , of which it instantly died . She was a 2d Time indicted by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Eliz Scott . Last Thursday Morning I was coming down Holborn about 6 o'Clock , and between the Bull and Gate and Great Turnstile , I saw something lie in the Kennel , which surprized me . I call 'd to my Partner , - Lord , Betty ( says I ) come hither ! when we came to look at it , we found it was a new born Child ; - it lay in the Kennel , just against Mr. Fryar the Baker 's Door . We took it up , and found it was dead , so we laid it on a Bulk two Doors from Mr. Fryar 's , and being very much 'frighted , I went to Mr. Birkhead 's over the Way for a pint of Purl , while I was drinking the Purl , News came that the Mother of the Child was found . I ran out , and found the Child had been brought into Mr. Fryar 's House , he bid me be easy , but I said , I would not stir from the Door till the Constable was fetch 'd ; then I went up to see the Child again , and I found the Prisoner in Bed , and the Child in the Room with her , - in a Garret up 3 pair of Stairs . I asked the Prisoner , how she could be so barbarous to throw her Child out of the Window ? All I could get from her was , - the Lord knows . Why , says I , it will certainly cry in your Face , she said nothing , but the Lord knows . Q . Did she own it to be her Child ? Scott . I ca n't say whether I asked her if it was her Child or no ; she only said , - the Lord knows . Eliz White . I was going to the New Market with my Partner , and she call 'd me to look at something that lay in the Kennel . We soon saw 't was a Child ; so I took hold of the Head , and she - of the Heels , and we laid it upon a Cork-cutters Bulk , 2 Doors below Mr. Fryar 's . A Woman that was by , gave us a Piece of Sacking , and we cover 'd 'it with that , - for it was stark naked . Then we went to Mr. Birkhead 's for a Pint of Purl , and while we were there , we heard that the Mother was found , and that the Child was carried away . Sarah Lack . I lodge in Mr. Fryar 's House , but I never saw the Prisoner from the Time she came to our House , 'till the Morning the Accident happen 'd . My Husband hearing a Noise , look 'd out of the Window , and seeing something in the Kennel , he told me , he feared something was amiss , and desired me to go up Stairs . I went ' up , and rapp 'd at the Door , it was lock 'd , and no Body answer 'd : Upon this , I went to her Aunts Room , ( one Mrs. Woolham ) and told her she must get up , for I feared something was amiss with her Kinswoman . I told her , I was frighted out of my Wits , for there was a Child found in the Street , and I was afraid it was her Kinswoman Sarah 's . We went up together to the Prisoner 's Garret , and knock 'd at the Door , the Aunt call 'd to her , and bid her open the Door ; and as she stood at the outside of the Door , she asked her , - how it was with her now ? The Prisoner said , she was pure , to what she had been , and then she opened it . As soon as I came in , I saw something unusual on the Floor , upon which I ran to her , - with my Hands so , - and cry 'd , O Lord , Sarah , - what have you done ! This must be your Child , and you have thrown it out of the Window She made a very silly Answer , - it is so , or it must be so , or something to that Effect ; but I was so frighted , that I ca n't remember the particular Words , and the People flock 'd up Stairs so fast , that I could hear no more . There was a Bed in the Room , but I did not examine it . I remember I asked her who got the Child ? And she told me 't was Horatio Walpole 's under Coachman 's , who goes by the Name of Black Will . Mary Giles , Midwife . I live next Door to Mr. Fryar 's , about 6 o'Clock the Morning the Accident happened , I heard a Noise in the Street , so I got out of Bed and look 'd out of the Window , I saw a couple of Women in the Street , in a great Flurry of Spirits about a Child . I thought it was only a Child that had been dropp 'd , so I went to Bed again , and slept 'till about 8 o'Clock ; then I was called up by the Mob , and I went ( without my Stockings ) to the Prisoner 's Garret , there I beheld a Male Child , lying upon the Table ; and I imagine it wanted about a Fortnight or 3 Weeks of its Time . There was a small Bruise on the left Side of the Head . When I had view 'd the Child , I went to the Prisoner , - and oh you wicked Creature , says I , how could you do this wicked Deed to the Body of your Body , and Flesh of your Flesh ? She said , she did not know what she did , or something to that Purpose . I laid her in Order , & c. - and said , - come , if she has been wicked do n't let us be so too , let her have something warm ; but Hussy , says I to her , how could you do this ? this Child I am sure was born alive ; she said , yes it was I asked her if it cryed ? she said yes Then I went away , because the People said , I must not touch her 'till the Coroner came . William Brumfield , Surgeon . I was sent for to examine the Child , I found a large Bruise on the back Part of the Head , which we call the Os Occipitis . The Scull was not fractured , and the Reason it was not I think is this ; that in a Subject to young , the Bones are of too fine a Texture to break . I took off the Cranium , and found a large quantity of Blood upon the Brain , which I suppose was occasioned by the Fall . There was likewise a great deal of Blood in the Belly and Breast , which proceeded from the Rupture of some Blood Vessel , and these Things were the Occasion of its Death . I try 'd the Experiment of the Lungs in Water , ( which I take to be very certain ) and they floated ; this in my Opinion , was a sure Sign that the Child had breath 'd ; for if it had not , they would have subsided in the Water . Jane Raikes . The Prisoner complain 'd of the Cholic the Tuesday Night before this happen 'd , and I carried her up some burnt Gin . On Wednesday Morning I went up to her again , and found her Aunt with her , she said she was still very ill of the Cholic , and the next Morning the Child was found in the Street . Upon this I went up to her Garret , and found it in great Disorder , there were Signs of a Womans having been deliver 'd , and the People told her , that it was her Child ; She did not deny it , but told us , that Horatio Walpole 's under Coachman was the Father ; and that was all I heard . A Witness . The Prisoner always was a silly , giggling Creature - C. You must be sworn , if you have any Thing to say . Witness . As to swearing - I will swear any thing - of that Matter - but my Lord , I have known her ten or a dozen Years ; she was not so silly neither , but she was capable of Business . I know she liv 'd two Years , or two Years and a half , with Mr. Howard , that belongs to the Crown-Office , and always was a giggling , silly , empty Creature . The Prisoner in her Defence had nothing material to offer , only that she was out of her Senses when she committed this Fact . The Jury found her Guilty . Death . 4 , 5 Thomas Car , of London , Gent . and Elizabeth Adams , of London , Spinster , were indicted for assaulting William Quarrington , in the House of Mary Prevost , Widow , in the Parish of St. Dunstan 's in the West , putting him in corporal Fear and Danger of his Life , and taking from him a gold Ring , set with five Diamonds , val . 6 l. 93 Guineas , and 8 s. in Silver , Sept. 10 . William Quarrington On the 9th of September , I went to the Bank , and received 100 l. and after calling at several Places , I went to Mr. Daxon , who lives in Forestreet , by Cripplegate ; with him I went to the Three Mariners , in the same Street , and staid there 'till about 5 or 6 in the Evening . Then I went into Southwark , to speak to a Friend ; he was not at Home , so I waited 'till about 9 for his coming in . Then I came over the Bridge , in Order to go Home , and as I pass 'd up Fleet Street , by Temple bar , I met a common Woman in the Street ( not the Woman at the Bar ) and she asked me to give her a Glass of Wine . I consented , and we went to the Angel and Crown , at the Corner of Sheer-lane , close by Temple-bar . The Drawer shew 'd us into a Room , up one Pair of Stairs , and a Bottle of Red Port being brought us he departed . We sat together about half an Hour , and then the Drawer came into the Room , and told me , he had peeped thro ' the Key-hole , and that the Woman was picking my Pocket . I found there had been a Pique , or a Quarrel between the Woman and him ; but upon his telling me , he knew her to be a Pick-pocket , I was a little uneasy . He insisted upon it , that he had seen her pick my Pocket , tho ' I was very sure she had not . Then he desired to know , if I had any Money about me , and wish 'd I would tell it over , to see if I had lost any . At his Request , I was so foolish and ignorant , as to tell 93 Guineas , and about 20 Shillings over , before the Drawer and the Woman ; and I told them , I had lost nothing . Notwithstanding this , Words arose between the Drawer and the Woman , and he turn 'd her down Stairs . She was no sooner gone , but the Drawer return 'd into the Room , with Mrs. Prevost , and the Prisoner Elizabeth Adams ; and Mrs. Adams desired me to stay in the House , 'till the Woman was quite gone ; and told me , it was a happy Thing , that I had lost none of my Money ; for the Woman that came in with me , was a common Street-walker , and a Strumpet of the Town . Three or four Minutes after this , I went down Stairs , intending to go Home ; but as I was going away , the Prisoner Car , stood at the Kitchen-door , and beckon 'd to me . I went to him , and he told me - Sir , you was with a common Strumpet and Pick-pocket ; and he desired to know , if I had lost any Money ; telling me , if I had - the Gentlewoman of the House would come into Scandal , and would be blam 'd . He appearing like a Gentleman , with a silver-lac 'd Waistcoat , I thought he would use me like a Gentleman ; so at his Request I went into the Kitchen . There were He ( Mr . Car ) the Prisoner Adams , Mrs. Prevost , the two Drawers , and another Man and a Woman , all in the Kitchen - three Women and four Men in all , besides myself . They desired me to do it - and I did tell out the Money which I had told over before , and inform 'd them , I had lost nothing . Mr . Car said , he was very glad I had not , and call 'd for a Bottle of Wine to treat me - Q . Did you know him before ? Quarrington . No : I never saw him before , in my Life - but it was at his Request , that I told over my Money in the Kitchen , and he insisted upon treating me , telling me , it should not be at my Expence . I ( thinking myself very safe ) sat down , and drank Part of his Bottle of Wine , and when that Bottle was out , I called for another , in Answer to Mr . Car 's Bottle . When this Bottle was drank out , we had another , and he and I were to club our Shillings a-piece for it 'T was at Mr . Car 's Request , I staid all this while : For he told me , it would be dangerous for me to go out , before the Woman was quite gone - she might ( he said ) set some-body upon me , to rob me , or knock me down , or carry me away to another House ; therefore he desired me to stay : Tho ' the Woman was out of the House , yet ( he said ) she might stand about the Door , to watch for my coming out . It was between one and two o'Clock , when the third Bottle was out : Then he told me , he thought it too late for me to go Home , and that I might stay there all Night , assuring me , I should be very safe . On his persuading me , and telling me , how dangerous it would be for me , with a Charge of Money about me , to go out at that Time o'Night , I agreed to stay , and Mr . Car told me , he would himself see me up Stairs , and safe in Bed ; the rest of the Company said , they would all see me safe in Bed ; so all those who were in the Kitchen , went up Stairs with me . There were the two Drawers , Mr . Car , Mrs. Prevost , Mrs. Adams the Prisoner , another Man and Woman - they all went up with me . I paid my Reckoning before I went up , and had the rest of the Money in my Pocket . But I had not been two Minutes in the Room , before Mr . Car seiz 'd me by the Throat , with his Left-hand , and having a Case-knife in his Right-hand , he swore he would cut my Throat if I made a Noise . Seven People were then present , and they threw me down on the Floor ; some of them held my Legs , and some my Arms . Mr . Car , with the Assistance of the two Drawers , threw me down , and when I lay on the Floor , he swore several Oaths , that if I made the least Resistance or Noise , he would cut my Throat from Ear to Ear . Then he took my Money out of my Pocket , and my Ring off my Finger ; the Money he put into my Hat , which lay on the Floor ; he took from me , 93 Guineas , and about 8 or 10 Shillings in Silver . Then they gave me Liberty to sit down in a Chair , and I saw Car distribute my Money to the People in the Room . Q . Was Mrs. Prevost , and Mrs. Adams ( the Prisoner ) present ? Quarrington . Yes : I was resolved to cry out , when they threw me down , but Mrs. Adams ( the Prisoner ) stopped my Mouth with an Handkerchief . Mrs. Prevost held one of my Legs , while Car took the Money out of my Pocket . After this , they said , I seem 'd to be very much surpriz 'd ; so Mr . Car order 'd the Drawer to go down for a Couple of Bottles of Wine . When the Wine came up , they fill 'd a Glass , which I believe was a full Pint-glass , and with bitter Oaths and Imprecations , they forced me to drink it off . Then they fill 'd another , and made me drink that . And a third was fill 'd , which I drank half off , and then could not get down any more . Two Glasses and a half they forced me to drink - ( the two first of which were filled up to the Brim ) then I told them , if they kill 'd me , I could not drink any more , upon which they undress 'd me , and forced me into Bed , and left me , swearing , that if I made the least Noise , they would come and cut my Throat , to prevent my telling Tales . These ( as near as I can remember ) are the very Words they made use of . I lay very uneasy 'till about 9 or 10 the next Morning , fearing , if I stirr 'd , my Life would be taken away ; and then hearing People go backward and forward in the Streets , I ventur 'd to dress myself ; then I crept down Stairs , and stole out of the House unobserv 'd . I immediately went to Sir William Billers for a Warrant for these People , but he not being in Town , I return 'd as fast as I could , to the Constable of the Parish , and thought to have taken them up without a Warrant ; but he did not Care to do that . Then remembering I had heard Car 's Name mention 'd in the Company , I enquired for one Car an Attorney , and a Porter at the Middle-temple , told me , there was one Car liv 'd in Elm court : I found out his Chambers , and asked the young Fellow , that goes for his Clerk , if Mr . Car was within ? He said , No . I asked him when he would be at Home ? He could not inform me . I enquir 'd if he was out of Town ? He could not tell whether he was or not . Q . Did you never see the Prisoner Car before ? Quarrington . No ; nor Mrs. Adams neither ; but I am sure they are the very Persons that did what I have related . One Thing ( my Lord ) I have forgot - Mr. Bird , Sir William 's Clerk , advised me to go to Mr. Jones , thinking he might assist me in getting my Money again ; and I went to his House , but he was not at Home . I have no more to say , but that I have sworn the Truth , and nothing but the Truth . Q . How were the Prisoners apprehended ? Quarrington . Mr . Car was apprehended first , at his Chambers , and he gave Directions where we might find Adams and Prevost , but Prevost was fled . Q . Were the Directions right , which he gave you ? Quarrington . I did not go with the Constable to find them . He and Mr. Jones 's Man , upon Car 's Information , found out , and took Adams . Councel . How long was you in Company with the Woman you first brought into the House ? Quarrington . About half an Hour . Counc . Did you go immediately to this House , after you pick 'd her up ? Quarrington Some Words were spoken , to before , and then I went with her to this Tavern , and was there with her only , about half an Hour . Councel You had been at the Alehouse before , and I suppose , had drank a good many Pots of Beer ; how much might you have drank before you came to the Angel ? Quarrington . About three Pints of Beer , to my own Share , I believe . Counc . But then you say , you had a Bottle of Wine with the first Woman ? Quarrington . Yes ; but I did not drink one Glass of it . In such Houses , 't is usual to call for something . I drank none of the Wine ; and as for the Woman , I know nothing of her , any farther than by Conversation . Counc . But you drank liberally below Stairs ? Quarrington . No ; I did not - Car treated me with a Bottle - Councel . And you genteely call 'd for another , and then there was a third , and a fourth ? Quarrington . No , Sir : There was no more than the third , and that we join 'd for . Counc . Was you sober ? Quarrington . I ca n't say I was sober , nor was I so far in Liquor , but I knew every Thing that pass 'd Counc . Then you was half Seas over ? Quarrington Yes : as you call it . Counc . So after you had drank this Wine , they all of them waited upon you to Bed ? Quarrington . They did so , Sir : And when they had got me up Stairs , they robb 'd me . Counc . And will you stand to that , Sir ? Quarrington . Yes . As I am on my Oath before the Great GOD , I say nothing that is untrue . I have no Interest in prosecuting the Prisoners . Counc . I think you say , you crept unobserv 'd out of the House , the next Morning ? Quarrington . Yes ; I saw Prevost and Adams in the Kitchen , but I ran out of Doors . Counc . And did you alarm the Neighbours when you got out ? Quarrington . I went to Sir William Billers as fast as I could , but I did not speak to the Neighbours . I did not well know which Way to proceed . Counc . Did not Mrs. Prevost and Mrs. Adams offer to stop you , when you ran out ? Quarrington . No , I crept down Stairs , and ran out directly to Sir William Billers : When I return 'd , they were gone , and the Doors were shut up . The House was shut up about half an Hour after I got out . Counc . Are you sure of that ? Quarrington . I will not swear exactly to the Time ; but 't was shut up in the Time of my going to , and returning from Sir William 's , and Mr. Jones 's . Counc . What Account did you give to Mrs. Jones ? Quarrington . I was not very Particular in my Account to her , nor did I mention Mr . Car 's Name to her . What signified my mentioning the Particulars to a Woman ? Jury . We desire his Lordship would please to ask the Questions that are proper , and that the Man may not be interrupted . Car . When the Woman you picked-up was turned down Stairs , and you follow 'd , you say I beckon 'd to you . Pray , in what Position was I when you saw me ? Quarrington . He was standing at the Kitchen-door , and he beckoned me in . Car . Who did you see at my Chambers beside my Clerk ? Quarrington . I saw a Woman washing a Room , but I do n't know who she was . Car . What Name did you go by , that Night ? Quarrington . I never mention 'd what my Name was . Car . What did you declare to my Clerk , and to the Woman you saw in my Chambers ? Quarrington . I said I had been robb 'd , and then I went down Stairs , and said nothing farther . I did not mention who had robb 'd me . Car . What Declaration did you make to the Constable that you went to first ? Quarrington . I told him what Money I had been robb 'd of ; I mention 'd my Ring , and I desired him to go to the House and take up the People . I told him likewise , that I had found out an Attorney of the Temple , who was concern 'd . Car . What Time did you go to that Constable ? Quarrington . The next Day , about 12 at Noon ! and I told him I had found where you might be taken ; but as the Constable did not approve of taking you without a Warrant , I did not then tell him the whole of the Story . Car . What did my Man say when you came to take me ? Quarrington . I asked him if you was within , he did not speak in a Minute or two , seeing the Constable ; but you happened to open a Door in another Room , I perceived you , and said , there 's the Man that robb 'd me ; you was frighted , as your Conscience pleaded guilty , - you knew it to be too true . Car . Did not you go into the Kitchen when you came down in the Morning ? Quarrington . No ; I saw Prevost and Adams in the Kitchen , but I did not speak to them . Car . And did you see nobody but Prevost and Adams in the Kitchen ? Quarrington . Yes ; another Woman that was there the Night before , and she was crying out , - or was very sorrowful about something . Prisoner Adams . Did not you come into the Kitchen for your Hat and Cane ? Quarrington . No ; nor did I speak to you or any one else . Car . Why did not you call out of the Windows ? Quarrington . I was frighted with your Threats and the Drawer 's , and I thought if I stirr 'd , I should have my Throat cut . - I durst not stir . Q . Did you sleep any Part of the Night ? Quarrington . I believe I slept about Half an Hour . Car . Did you eat nothing in the Kitchen that Night ? Quarrington . Yes , some cold Lamb , and I cut my Finger I remember ; and I remember that you call 'd Mrs. Adams your Dear Betsy , and she call 'd you her Dear Tommy . Adams . Did not the Woman you brought in , rob you of 15 Guineas and a Half ? Quarrington . No ; she robbed me of nothing . Adams . Did not you offer to spend a Guinea in the House , and to give the Drawers Money for taking care of you ? Quarrington . I did give the Drawer a Shilling that was so officious as to tell me the Woman was picking my Pocket . Adams . Was not you so drunk that the Drawer carried you up Stairs upon his Back ? Quarrington . No ; I walked up myself ; nobody assisted me . Adams . It signifies nothing to ask him any more Questions , - he denies them all . Car . Why did not you indict Mrs. Prevost and the Drawers ? Quarrington . Because I was told it signified nothing to indict them , unless they had been in Custody . Car . Did you give the same Account in your Information , that you have done now ? Quarrington . The Truth will never err : I think I gave the same Account in that , as I have done now . William Stamper . I settled an Affair with the Prosecutor a Night , or a Night or two , before he was robb 'd , and he invited me to come and dine with him the next Sunday ; I went , and he told me he had met with a great Misfortune , and confess 'd he had pick 'd up a Woman , and had carried her to the Angel . He told me that she was soon turned out of the House , but that he had been robb 'd by several People , mentioning no Names . I told That Angel was the worst Angel within the Walls of the City , except the Angel in Bishopsgate street , - they 're both Angels . He informed me that he had lost 93 Guineas and a Diamond Ring worth 8 l. Q . Did he say he was robb 'd by the first Woman ? Stamper . No ; he said she was turned out of the House , because she was not one of Mother Prevost 's Does . He gave me no Account then of the Robbery , but afterwards he digested every Thing into an Affidavit before Sir William Billers . On the Monday after the Robbery , he came and told me that one Car , of the Temple , was one of the Persons that had robbed him . I said , I remembered a Person of that Name , whom I knew some Years ago ; and when Car was brought to Alderman Billers 's Office , my Curiosity led me to go to see him . I found him telling the Story to Mr. Bird , and that it was the same Person I had formerly known in Bridges street . The Prisoner Car knew me , and told me , that the Prosecutor , disguis 'd in Liquor , brought a Woman into the Angel , whom he knew to be a common Pick-pocket ; that she was turned out of the House , and that he , Car himself , bid him examine his Pockets ; upon which the Prosecutor ( he said ) pulled out 93 Guineas . Car told me he saw the 93 Guineas , and that the Prosecutor returned him many Thanks for his Care , and desired him to accept of a Bottle of Wine , which he did ; and then ( he said ) they had another , which made the Prosecutor so drunk , that he was carried upon a young Fellow 's Shoulders to Bed . This was the Story that Car told me at Sir William Biller 's Office . Q . Do you know the Prosecutor ? Stamper . I have known him a Year , during which Time I never heard any Harm of him . He lives upon his Means , having married a Woman of some Fortune . Francis Lane , Constable . He gave exactly the same Account with Mr. Stamper ; that Mr . Car own 'd he called the Prosecutor into the Kitchen , that he advised him to tell his Money over , and that he saw him pull out 80 Guineas which were laid on the Table , and 13 Guineas he kept in his Hand . Car . Did not I order my Laundress to go with you to the Place where Mrs. Adams might be found ? Quarrington . Yes ; and she went with us , and enquired for her . When she appeared we took her , and she immediately cry 'd out , Oh ! you are a base Jade for detecting me - no one knew where to find me but you . Adams . To the Constable . Did not you leave me in the Street while you went into a Cook's-Shop for a Dram of Gin ? Constable . No ; my Lord , she was never out of my Sight , - nor did I go any where for a Dram of Gin . Car . Might not I have escaped ? Constable . No , I believe not ; I took care that you should not . Adams . My Lord , I do n't see that 't is to any Purpose to ask them any more Questions , when they deny all . Mr. Deveil . Some few Days ago , - I ca n't exactly recollect the Time , - Mr. Quarrington apply 'd to me for a Warrant to take up the Persons that are untaken ; and he told me this Story exactly agreeable to the Evidence he has now given . I have known him and his Parents a great while ; I never heard any Harm of him in my Life ; I believe him to be an honest Man , and have heard he has married a Woman of a good Fortune , but his Life and Conversation since his Marriage , I know very little of . Mr . Car . Mrs. Prevost is the Widow of one Prevost , who was Master of the King 's Seal Office in the King's-Bench and Common Pleas , and I thought my Acquaintance with her not degrading . I did Business for her as an Attorney , and was spoke to by Mr. Stevens , an Officer , to attend her this Night ; Mr. Salt can inform the Court what my Business was , and he likewise knows the Reason of my being in the Kitchen that very Night . I shall prove that I was at Home , and in Bed in my Chambers in the Temple , by One o'Clock , before the Temple Watchmen went One o'Clock . I will prove , that next Morning Mrs. Prevost sent for me , and that I met Mr. Salt afterwards at Hick 's Hall ; that the Prosecutor told my Clerk how he was robb 'd , and promis 'd to reward him if he would help him to find out the People of the House . I was angry when I heard the Prosecutor had been to enquire for me , that they did not ask him where he liv 'd . On the 12th of September one John Andrews , a Joiner or a Carpenter , - a Man of an evil Fame , - the Man that made Rudkins 's Will , he came to me and told me , that a School-fellow of his had been robb 'd of 93 Guineas at the Angel , and if I did not find out the Persons before the Money was all spent , the Man would swear the Robbery against me ; he said I must come down the Whole , - or the best Part of the Money . I told him I would endeavour to find out Mrs. Prevost and the Drawers , but the People had carried off all their Goods , and were gone off . The Man told me if I had no Money , I had good Books , and must make Money of them . I never kept out of the Way upon this Account ; I was sent for to Hampstead upon Business , but I refused to go , because it should not be suspected that I kept out of the Way . The Monday after the Robbery , two Gentlemen came from Greenwich , where I live in as much Reputation as any Man that practiseth the Law - in the whole Place , and when I told them I was to be sworn into a Robbery , they laughed at me . The Wednesday following this Andrews came again , and I asked him to let me see the Gentleman ; he said no , I should not . I told him I would advertise the People , and endeavour to take them up ; but he told me that would signify nothing , and immediately he took a Sheet of Paper , and fell to writing , - This Deponent maketh Oath , - without setting down any Name ; and what he then wrote was very different from what the Prosecutor has said now . It is very unlikely I should be concerned with Mrs. Prevost and Mrs. Adams , and 2 Irish Drawers , in executing a Robbery . I was so far from calling the Prosecutor into the Kitchen , that I sat with my Leg up in a Chair when he came in , and told us that he did not know how to make us all amends for coming into so honest a House . Mr. Thomas Stevens deposed , That he informed Mr . Car that Mrs. Prevost desired him to call upon her for Instructions , in Order to his being employ 'd in defending her at Hick's-Hall ; an Information being there lodg 'd against her , for keeping a disorderly House . Mr. Salt deposed , That he was concerned in the Prosecution of Mrs. Prevost , for keeping a disorderly House , and that Mr . Car appear 'd in her Defence , and he seem 'd not to be under any Concern . C. Mr . Car is not to be tried by his Looks , but by his Actions . John Craster . Mr. Salt serv 'd me with a Subpaena on Friday Night , for me to appear at Hicks's-Hall against Mrs. Prevost . She sent for me to her House that Night ; and there I found Mr . Car and Mrs. Prevost , with some other Neighhours who were subpaena 'd with me on the same Account . Mr . Car told us , that we need not obey the Sulpaana 's , for they were not 1 gal ones . We left the House about 12 o'Clock that Night , and left Car behind us . There were Mr . Car , Mrs. Adams , and Mrs. Prevost , and one Mr. Spidel . I did not see Quarrington there . Robert Thomlinson , gave an Account that he was sent by a Woman from the Angel to fetch Mr . Car , from his Chambers No . 4. in Elm-Court in the Temple . That when he returned to the Angel , he saw the Woman crying ; that she bid him come again in 2 Hours for his Money , which he did , according to his Orders , but found the Doors all shut up , and that he never had any Thing for his Job . Charus Phillipson . I am Clerk to Mr . Car . On Saturday the 10th of September , while my Master was at Hicks's-Hall attending Mrs. Prevost 's Affair , the Prosecutor came to the Chambers to enquire for Mr . Car . I told him he was not at Home , he said he came about a Thing which would be of great Advantage ; but he would not leave his Name , nor his Business : at last , he said he had been robb 'd at the Angel , by the People of the House . Upon this , I called the Laundress , and he told her the same . He did not charge Mr . Car , nor mention his Name ; he only in general , charged the People of the House , and desired to know if my Master could give any Intelligence of them . He told us likewise , that when he came down in the Morning , he acquainted them that he had been robb 'd , and that he went out in Order to ask Advice of a Friend , but when he return 'd , the House was shut up , and the People were fled . Q . What Time did your Master come Home that Night ? Phillipson . To the best of my Knowledge , it was before the Watchman went One . At that Time he had a Leg in so much Hazard , that no Body could think him capable of taking a Man by the Collar and robbing him . He had 9 Holes in his Leg , and he could not walk up Stairs without resting himself . On Monday the 12th of Sept. one Andrews came to the Chambers to enquire for my Master , and he told me he came about one Wilson , and said , 't was a sad Affair , and he was sorry for Mr . Car , but this Wilson was a School-fellow of his - a particular Friend , and had been robb 'd , and if my Master did not compound and settle the Affair , it would be sworn upon him . Q . How do you know this Andrews meant the Prosecutor , when he talked of Wilson ? Phillipson Because he mentioned the Angel , and I suppose there had not been 2 Robberies committed there . Quarrington . My Lord , if I may speak , - this Andrews I know nothing of ; I never saw him in my Life . Q . Was this Andrews acquainted with your Master ? Phillipson . He was concerned with him sometime ago , in a Distress that was made at Wapping . Martha Grainger , the Laundress . I have forgot the Day of the Month ; but I remember 't was on a Saturday about half an Hour after One , that the Prosecutor came to enquire for my Master ; he happen 'd not to be at Home . The Clerk ask 'd him his Business , and he inform 'd us , that he had been in my Master 's Company at the Angel the Night before , and after Mr . Car was gone , he was robb 'd of 93 Guineas and 11 s. in Silver , and of a Ring , which he valu 'd at 8 Guineas ; he did not say who robb 'd him , but he told us that he lay there all Night , and got up in the Morning ; that he came down Stairs and complain 'd to the Woman of the House that he was robb 'd , and then he said he went out to advise with a Friend ; but when he return 'd the House was shut up , and the People were all gone . He told us , he should be glad if Mr . Car could give him any Information of them , and where they were gone . He did not then pretend that my Master was concerned . I asked him if he suspected any Person in particular ? And he told us no , he did not . I have look 'd after Mr . Car 's Chambers 8 Years . Q . Are you marry 'd ? Grainger . No , I was hir 'd to do his Business . Car . What Time was I a-bed that Night ? Grainger . Before the Watchman came One o'Clock . I was not a-bed when he came Home , he ordered me to get him a clean Shirt against Morning . At this Time he was lame , and had 9 Holes in his Leg . C. But he could walk about . Grainger . Yes , with his Garters unty 'd , and he could not get up 2 pair of Stairs without resting . My Master was very angry because we did not ask the Prosecutor where he liv 'd , and he told us , if he came again , he must see him . Accordingly when he came again , my Master was coming out of his Study , upon which the Prosecutor turn 'd round , and brought in the Constable , and said , - there 's your Prisoner . Jane Lucas . I was Servant in the House when the Robbery was committed , I went to Bed that Night about 12 , and I left in the Kitchen only my Mistress , the two Prisoners , and the two Drawers , - no Soul else was there . Q . Why , was not the Prosecutor there ? Lucas . O ! yes , the Man that lost his Money . Q . Were not the Drawers in the Kitchen ? Lucas . No , Edwards and Travers , that we call 'd Nat , were about the House , but not in the Kitchen . I heard no Noise all Night ; but next Morning when I got up , I found the Street Door o'jar , I imagin 'd the Drawers had forgot to shut it over Night , I rang the Bell to call them up , and my Mistress was in Bed , but she call 'd to me to know the Reason why Nat was not come down , I went up to see what was become of them , and I found their Bed made , and that they had not been in Bed all Night . I came down and told Mrs Prevost of this , and she was 'frighted , - Lord , ( says she ) they have certainly kill 'd the Man , run and call Adams , and see if the Man is safe . I went up , and found the Prosecutor snoaring in Bed , then I ran immediately to Mrs. Prevost , and told her the Man - snoar 'd . Lord , ( says she directly ) we are all ruin 'd - ruin 'd , let me go and see what I am about . The Prosecutor presently came into the Kitchen , and he cried , - I am robb 'd - I am robb 'd - I am robb 'd ! - 3 Times in the Kitchen , - but he did not charge any Body , and away he went . Mrs. Prevost being very timerous and fearful , she went away too , - because she did not know where to go , nor what to do . Call Betty Adams - says she , - and let her be gone too , till we see whether we are safe . Q . Was any one in the Kitchen beside your self when the Man said he was robb 'd three Times ? Lucas . No , there was none but himself ; for my Mistress was doing her Things up in the Bar , - she was so 'frighted . Q . Why did not you say your Mistress was in Bed ? Lucas . Yes , Sir . Q . Why , when did the Man come down and say he was robb 'd ? Lucas . While we two were talking of it , - she in Bed ; - but she got up . She laid in a little Room behind the Bar . Q . But when the Man came into the Kitchen and said he was robb 'd , - she was in some Confusion , and was for packing up her Things to be gone ? Lucas . Yes , Sir . And indeed I tell the Truth of the Thing , - was it for K - G - I would not tell a Lye to d - n my Soul . Q . What were the Words she made use of when she heard the Man say he was robb 'd ? Lucas . I ca n't tell whether she heard the Man say he was robb 'd , or no Q . Why , you say , she cry 'd out she was ruin 'd , - and undone ? Lucas . Yes , Sir , - but that was before the Man came down , and she bid me lock up the Doors , till - Things were put in Order . Adams Prisoner . Why did not the Man come into the Kitchen for his Hat and his Cane ? - And did he not speak to me at the same Time ? Lucas . I ca n't swear whether Mrs. Adams was there or not . C. You said there was none but you in the Kitchen when the Man came down Stairs ? Lucas . Sir , I was busy a dressing my Mistress , - I was busy with her in her Room , and she sent me to call Mrs. Adams . C. To give her Notice to go off , - was it not ? Lucas . Yes , - Sir . Joseph Allen . All I know of the Matter is this . This Creature ( Lucas ) liv 'd with me about 6 Months , and I believe her to be an honest , harmless Creature . I sent a Porter to Mr . Car in Newgate , to let him know she had liv 'd with me . I know Mr . Car , and have employ 'd him and paid him , - I know no Harm of him - not I. Eliz Bristow . I live over the Way and sell Greens : on that Saturday Morning , - I think 't was last Saturday was three Weeks , I heard a great Mourning , between 8 and 9 in the Morning , - and I heard a Man say , - Oh ! - Oh ! - Oh ! - I am undone ! - What shall I do ! Give me my Money and my Ring ! And another Voice said , - what would you have me do , I can do nothing 'till they come ; then I lost the Voice , and presently the House was shut up . Dr. Lilly . I have known the Prisoner Car some Years , he was well born and educated , but I have had no great Acquaintance with him . I thought him too well educated to have been guilty of such a Fact , I always thought him an honest Man . Mrs. Jones . The Gentleman that lost his Money , came to enquire for Mr. Jones , by Mr. Bird 's Direction . He said he had been at the Angel , the last Night , and had been robb 'd of 70 Guineas , some Silver , and his Watch and Ring . The Woman of the House he said took his Money ; - he nam 'd none else . Car . I desire John Bundey may be called ; he heard Quarrington 's first Complaint . Bundey . I know nothing of the Matter , only I heard Quarrington tell Mr. Gold ( a Constable ) that he had been at the Angel , - all Night , - I think , and Mr . Car ( he said ) was up Stairs with him . He came to Mr. Gold to take Charge of him , for he said that Car had robbed him of 93 Guineas , eight or ten Shillings in Silver , and a Diamond Ring . Mr. Justice Poulson , William Trigg , Joseph White , Thomas Hitchings , James Alder , Andrew Thompson , William and Peter Hack , Charles Bailey , Edward Mabert , and - Pardoe , always took the Prisoner Car to be an honest Man , and never heard any Thing like this of him before . Adams . I have no Witnesses , for Mr. Mabson told me the Matter was made up . Bartholomew Smith . Mabson , I believe , had told Mrs. Adams that the Affair would be made up , for I went to her in Newgate last Tuesday , and she told me she should have no Occasion to trouble her Friends , for Mabson had been with her . Mr. Quarrington was at the Coffee-House with Mabson , and Mabson asked him what he intended to do ? He reply 'd , he would do nothing without his Attorney . The Jury found both the Prisoners Guilty . Death . 6 , 7. Charlotte Gregg , ( a little Girl ) and Elizabeth Douglas , ( her Mother ) were indicted for stealing a leather Bag , val . 1 d , a thirty-six Shilling piece of Gold , 17 Guineas , 3 half Guineas , and 5 Shillings in Silver , the Property of Ann Howell in her dwelling House , in the Parish of St. Ann 's , Westminster , October 8 . Ann Howell . The Prisoners lodged in my House , at the Black-Horse , in Earls-Court in Cranbourn-Alley . The Money mention 'd in the Indictment , was lost out of a Desk , in my own Chamber , up one pair of Stairs . Q . Was your Desk lock 'd ? Howell . I turned the Key myself , - I thought it lock 'd When my Money was gone I suspected the Prisoners , because they fell out last Saturday Night with another of my Lodgers , and in the Quarrel they taxed one another with pawning my Goods which they used in the Rooms . In the Dispute between them I heard that the Prisoner had pawned my Sheets of their Bed , to pay me for their Lodging . This gave me some Suspicion , and I got a Warrant to search the House of Mrs. Cooper in Castle street , by the Meuse where I knew the Prisoners frequented ; there I found a Trunk with my Leather Bag , and 16 Guineas , a 36 Shilling Piece , three Half Guineas , and two Half Crowns in it . - There was only one Guinea wanting . Margaret Cooper . Charlotte Gregg brought this Trunk to my House new and empty , and told me that her Landlady was going off , and so she would bring away some odd Things to put into it . I asked her where she got the Money to buy this Trunk , and she told me that a Friend had lent her a Guinea . She came two or three Times and said she had brought some little Things , - as Wristbands and Borders , to put into it : she always lock 'd it , and I never saw what was in it . When the Officer came with the Search-Warrant , I saw the Trunk opened , and the Money poured out of this very bag , and 't was wrapped up in this old Rag . I did not tell the Money over , but I remember I saw the Broad Piece of Gold and the Silver . On Saturday the Mother came to the House to see the Trunk , but I ca n't say whether she opened it or not ; the Daughter was then with her , and I left them together in the Room . Thomas Pow , Constable . Mrs. Howell brought me two Warrants , one to take the Prisoner , and the other was a Search-Warrant . Mrs. Howell 's Maid bid me go and search Cooper 's Lodgings , for she had seen them all whispering together . We went , and found this Trunk hid behind the Bed . Mrs. Howell immediately knew the Bag , and the Money ( sixteen Guineas , three Half Guineas , a 36 Shilling Piece , and two Half Crowns ) were found in it . I should have carried Mrs. Cooper before Mr. Deveil , but I only took the two Prisoners , and Gregg ( the little one ) owned the Fact before him , but her Mother ( she said ) knew nothing of the Matter . The Mother said she did not know when her Daughter took the Money , but she knew of it after it was taken , and would have convey 'd it into the Place from whence it was taken if it had been possible , but as it was not , she said if she could get 6 d. she would have been let Blood , and then would have bled to Death . Prisoner , Douglas . I never knew the Child had taken the Money , till the Monday that Mrs. Howell miss 'd it . Prisoner , Gregg . Mrs. Howell herself was the first Person that made me think of stealing the Money ; for my Mother owing her some Rent , she bid me one Night when I went out , before to bring her some Money , - no Matter how I came by it ; telling me if I did not , - I shou 'd come in there no more . Douglas , the Mother . I am sure I never saw a Farthing of the Money , 'till I saw it before the Justice . Mrs. Howell . The Mother says , she never saw the Money - why she gave me half a Guinea of my own Money to change . I believe it was Part of my own Money , because they had not a Penny to buy them a Role or Cheese , before I lost my Bag ; and the Mother told me , she had borrow 'd that half Guinea of Mrs. Cooper . Mrs. Cooper . She borrow 'd none of me . Mrs. Howell . After they had got my Money , the Mother bought her Girl a new Pair of Stockings and Shoes , and they had a good Loin of Pork for Dinner besides - and that Way went one of my half Guineas . Douglas Acquitted . Gregg Guilty . Death . 8. Alexander Ratcliffe , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-house of Thomas Gibson , in the Parish of St. James 's Clerkenwell , about the Hour of Two in the Night , and stealing a silver Watch , val . 4 l. a silver Porringer , val . 30 s. a silver Cup , val . 3 l. a silver Spoon , val . 10 s. and a Pair of silk Stockings , val . 10 s . March 26 . 1735 . Mr. Gibson . The Prisoner was taken on the Information of an Accomplice , who was concern 'd with him in robbing me . On the 25th of March 1735 , about One o'Clock in the Morning , my Servant called me up to assist him in my Business , and about Two I sent him into the Yard for the Scovel , to sweep the Oven . He had not gone far from the Bake-house Door , before I heard him cry out . I suspected what was the Matter , so I whipp 'd up a Pole , and ran to assist him : But before I got to the Door , I saw a Man with a Pistol in his Hand : He fired it at me , and wounded me in the Breast , and in the Arm , in a desperate Manner . The Rogue stood within the Bake-house . The first Pistol was no sooner fired , but a second came full in my Face , and beat me down : They were loaded with Bird shot , several of which I have now in my Body . When I was on the Ground , three Men came and took me up in their Arms , and unbottoning the Waistband of my Breeches , they took what Money I had , out of my Pockets - I believe there might be between ten and twenty Shillings . When they had done , they laid me down on the Ground , and brought my Servant in ( whom they had seized in the Yard ) and made him direct them , where they might have Candles to search the House ; then they ty 'd his Hands behind him , and a Handkerchief over his Eyes , and led him to several Places in the House , where the Things were , which they wanted ; and when they had done with him , they brought him to the Oven 's Mouth , where I lay on the Ground , and set him down on the Ground by me , and two Men were plac 'd as Guards over us ; one stood at my Head , and another at my Feet ; one of them had a Sword , and the other a Pistol . There was five of them in all - three ransack 'd the House , and took away Goods to the Value of 50 l. among which , were the Things mentioned in the Indictment . Q . Which Way did they come in ? Mr. Gibson . The Bake-house is contiguous to the Dwelling-house , and opens into a Yard : Which Yard is enclosed with a Brick-wall , and a Door opens in this Wall , into the Fields , toward Islington . I apprehend , one of them got over the Wall , and then open 'd the Door , and let the rest of them into the Yard . I can not take upon me to say , whether the Bake-house Door was shut or open , when the Man came who fir 'd at me ; but when they were ransacking the House , they broke a large Door , to get into a Room , and several other Doors and Locks they broke when they were in the House . The Judges who try 'd the former Cases ( for two Men have been executed already for this Fact ) were of Opinion , that this was a Burglary . They were about half an Hour in rifling the House , and when they had done , they ty 'd our Hands and Legs together , and then went out the same Way they came . The Prisoner was discover 'd some Time after , by the Information of an Accomplice , and according to that Information , I went to the Rose and Crown in Drury Lane , to take the Prisoner ; but he escap 'd over the Tops of the Houses , and got away to Ireland , from whence I fetch 'd him hither . I ca n't swear he was one of the Men that was in the House , but my Man will give the Court Satisfaction in that Particular . Bryan Bird . I need not relate the Manner of my first being seized , because my Master has done it , very exactly . C. You must give an Account what happen 'd to you . Bird . About 2 o'Clock in the Morning , I do n't remember particularly the Day of the Month , but 't was in the Year 1735 , I was at Work with my Master in the Bake-house , and went out into the Yard for the Scovel ; five Men rush 'd out of a back House in the Yard , which faced the back of the Oven , and they either knocked me down or push 'd me down , I ca n't tell which . Then they clapp 'd a Sword to my Throat , and a Pistol to my Breast , swearing if I made any Noise they would kill me . After they had silenc 'd me , they all went in Doors , except one Fellow , who stood Guard over me , with a Sword in his Hand . I saw the Flash of the Pistol that was fired at my Master in the Bake-house , and heard him cry out once . I did imagine they had kill 'd him , and that I should meet with the same Fate . In some little Time , the Man that stood Guard over me , made me go into the Bake-house with him , and there I found another Man standing over my Master , and two others were present : The Fifth Man having been my Master 's Servant but a little Time before , - he kept out of Sight , but he was the first Man that laid hold of me in the Yard . The Face of the Prisoner at the Bar I remember very well , I observed it , and am positive he is the very Person that robb 'd my Master ; I am sure he is the Man . When they came into the House they broke a strong old fashion 'd Door , and they broke Part of the Lock off to get it open . They broke open several Locks and Chests of Drawers , but I do n't know directly what Goods they took , for after they had brought me into the Bakehouse , they tied a Handkerchief over my Eyes , but I know the Prisoner was one of the three that went up and down the House to rifle it . I am sure he is one of them . Prisoner . What Cloaths had I on at that Time ? Bird . I did not mind any Cloaths ; I endeavoured to observe their Faces , - not their Cloaths . Prisoner . Were any of the Men disguised ? Bird . Yes ; one Man was disguised , and he was the Man that had been my Master 's Servant . Prisoner . I would ask Mr. Gibson , whether Mr. White saw me at Bristol , when he took the two Men who were tried here before ? Mr. Gibson . No ; you did not go to Bristol with the rest ; - you did not fly till you was pursued . Prisoner . The Night Mr. Gibson was robb 'd , I was at a Christening , and staid there all Night , by the same Token I quarrell 'd with a Man , and he cut me over the Lip with a Candlestick . Mary Field . On Sunday , March 23 , 1735 , the Prisoner was at a Christening of mine , - I beg Pardon , I was delivered of a Child on the Sunday , and it was christened the next Day , - the next Evening ; the Prisoner was present , and some Words happening between him and another Man , the Man took up a Candlestick and cut him on the Lip . I live at Mrs. Austen 's in Cable Street , by Rag Fair . The Prisoner was intosticated ( intoxicated ) with Liquor , and so he desired to lie with my Husband , which he did not only that Night , but every Night till Thursday . Mary Maily . This good Woman 's Child was christened on Monday Night the 24th of March , - 't was last March was two Years ; the Prisoner was there , and he quarrell 'd with a Sailor , and got a Cut upon his Lip with a Candlestick , - there 's the Mark of the Cut now . I was the Person that got Vinegar and Wine to stop the Bleeding . He staid there all Night , and two or three Nights following ; during his Stay at this House he was very ill , and I got him some warm Ale to drink , and some Diaculum for his Cut . Q . What had you for Supper ? Maily . I did not take Notice of that ; it was something cold . Q . Who were the Gossips ? Maily . One that is gone to Sea ; and who the others were I ca n't tell . Q . What Liquors had you ? Maily . Strong Beer and other Liquors . The Prisoner was never out of the House from Monday , to Thursday or Friday following ; he was never out of the Doors . Alice Dugan . About two Years ago last March , I laid this Woman of a Child . - Q . What Day of the Week was it ? Dugan . I do n't know . Q . Do n't you know what Day of the Week it was ? Dugan . 'T was on a Sunday , - and the Christening was on Monday . I left the Prisoner there on Monday Night at almost Eleven . I went there again in a Day or two , and saw him there ; and Mrs. Field told me he had got Hurt , and had lain with her Husband . Q . What had you for Supper ? Dugan . I did not stay for Supper . Q . Why you did not go away till 11 o'Clock you say . Dugan . Yes , but I did not stay for Supper , it was something they had in a Publick House Q . What Liquor had you ? Dugan . Beer and Wine . I am sure he was there , for he gave me Half a Crown . I saw the Prisoner there on Monday Night , and on Thursday I went there again , and Mrs. Field told me that he had lain with her Husband ever since . He had then a Cloath about his Face , and I saw a Plaister upon his Lip . Besides , the Prisoner was one of the Gossips . Q . What was the Name of the Child ? Dugan . I ca n't tell ; - it was John I think William Drew . I liv 'd with Andrew Conolly , at the King's-Head , in King's-Head Court , in Drury-Lane , and drew Beer there . I remember one Morning Ward and Row ( who were executed for this Robbery ) and three others , came in and went up Stairs with a Bundle . Ward had a Coat with Yellow Buttons , and Row had a Pair of carv 'd Silver Buckles ; it frighted me so , - to see such Things opened , that I could see no more - The Prisoner at the Bar was not with them , - by Virtue of my Oath . Marget Chipsey . I have known the Prisoner four or five Years ; he work 'd at Labouring Work and resorted to Mrs. Austen 's , in Cable Street . At that Time in particular he came to me to buy a Shirt , for I sell such Things , - old and new , - and he was to give me four Shillings for it ; he gave me a Crown Piece to change , and it being Saturday Night , and I very busy , I gave him a Six-pence and a Half Guinea instead of two Six-pences ; but on Sunday Morning he came before I was up , and returned me the Half Guinea again - he 's a very honest Fellow . Alexander Graham had known him a considerable Time to follow Labouring Work , and never heard ill of him . Rebecca Loveit was the Prisoner 's Washerwoman , and he always paid her very honestly . Last Shrove-Tuesday was Twelvemonths he told her he was going to Ireland to receive a small Legacy . She had lived in the House with him two or three Years , and he always came Home - every Night - between 10 and 11 o'Clock . Prisoner . I hope your Lordship will consider that I have been a Year and a half in Goal on Account of this false Information . If I had been a Rogue , a Villain , or a Robber , certainly something would have come out against me lying in Goal all this Time . Guilty . Death . 9.

Mr. Bottomley . I can only say I lost the Things mentioned in the Indictment . John Sharp was then my Servant . John Sharp . The Prisoner and one William Cadmore and I committed this Robbery . Cadmore came with the Prisoner to my Master 's House about 5 o'Clock , in Dean-Street by St. Ann 's Church , Cadmore had been a Servant to my Master , and he said , he knew Mr. Bottomley had Cloaths to a great Value , and that he would break open the Chest and take them out . Accordingly he took 2 large chopping Knives or Cleavers , and went up Stairs , and wrenched the Chest open . The Prisoner and I assisted , we held the Chest open while Cadmore took out 6 or 7 Suits of Cloaths , which we pack 'd up and carried down Stairs . All three of us partook in the carrying them down . Then Cadmore and the Prisoner took them on their Arms , and carry 'd them out of Doors , - this was about 7 o'Clock at Night . Which Way they went with them I ca n't tell , for I staid in the House . The next Morning Watson the Prisoner came to bring me a clean Shirt , and told me that Cadmore had pawn 'd a Suit of these Cloaths for about 46 s. and had lost all the Money at a Gaming-house in Covent-Garden . He told me likewise , that he himself had pawn 'd another Suit for 14 s. this was on the Thursday . The next Morning my Master being gone to the Bank , I went to Cadmore 's Lodgings in a Court in Fleet street , over-against the Horn-Tavern ; but he was not at Home , he and the Prisoner I was informed , had just taken out two Bundles of Cloaths in a Coach before I came . Upon this , I went Home to Mr. Bottomley 's , and staid within 'till 6 o'Clock . Then I went to the Red-Lion Ale-house , and the Prisoner came to me , and after I parted with him , I return 'd Home . I did not see either of them again 'till the Friday following ; I had been to Market for a Shoulder of Mutton and some Apples , and met Watson the Prisoner ; while I was buying the Apples , Cadmore went by , - says the Prisoner , - there 's Cadmore , I went to him and told him , I expected to have seen him before that Time . He told me , he could not come to me , for he had sold the Cloaths , and lost all the Money ; and upon that we quarrelled . Q . How came you to make this Discovery ? Sharp . I was stopp 'd with some of the Things my self at a Pawnbrokers . I stole 2 silver Salts , and carry 'd them to a Pawnbrokers - beyond Tower-Hill , in order to pawn them , and the Man stopp 'd me and the Salts too ; he had just seen an Advertisement , in which the Goods we stole had been mentioned , so he took me , - and then I made the Discovery . Q . Who assisted you in stealing the Salts ? Sharp . The Prisoner ; for on Saturday after we had taken the Cloaths , he met me at the Red-Lion , and asked me whether I would go on with the Proposal , that he and I should rob my Master again ? Yes , says I , for as Cadmore has run away with the Money that was made of the Goods we took before , if I am to suffer , I may as well suffer with Money in my Pocket ; so he and I took the Pokers , and we broke open the Chambers one pair of Stairs ; and after that we broke open the Closets and a Writing Desk , out of which we took what we could find . Then we went up 2 pair of Stairs , and broke open a Closet , out of which we took 3 large Spoons , and some Tea Spoons ; ( but how many I ca n't swear to ) and two pair of silver Buckles , some Papers , and 2 Salts . The silver Saucepan we got below Stairs , and the silver Pepper-box . Then we went to the Chest again , and took out more Cloaths , 2 lac 'd Waistcoats , and 3 or 4 Coats ; we took likewise a silver gilt Sword ; all these Things Charles Carter took away for us , and by our Orders , in a Basket , he carried them to the Cellar where he lives , - in Dyot Street , St. Giles 's , he sells Greens there . After he had carry 'd them away , I went and took the Saucepan and sold it for 3 l. 4 s. 7 d. I sold the Tea-spoons likewise , but I have forgot what I had for them . I sold a pair of Tea-tongs which were broke , and the Salts I carry 'd to pawn , and was stopp 'd with them . As for the Cloaths , - the Prisoner Watson carry 'd them all away from the Cellar in a Portmanteau Prisoner . Did not you go and enquire for Cadmore , and say that 't was he that wrong 'd you ? Sharp . When I heard that Cadmore had disposed of the Goods , and had given me no Part of the Money , I went and enquired after him , and I left Word that I had Money coming out of the Country , and that he had wrong 'd me of much of it . Prisoner . Had I any share of the Plate ? Sharp . No , that I kept to my self ; but you had your Part of the Cloaths . Thomas Warner . On Wednesday Morning last , John Sharp came to my Shop to pawn a couple of Salts , I had just read the Advertisement , and these answering the Description , I asked him how he came by them , and he not giving me a satisfactory Answer , I carry 'd him before Justice Dennet , there he made his Information , and Mr. Bottomley owned the Goods . Stephen Sweetland . When Sharp was carry 'd before Justice Dennet , I assisted the Constable , and the Justice ordered me to go and tell Mr. Bottomley that the Thief was catch 'd . As we were carrying him to Newgate , he directed us where we might find the Prisoner , and accordingly we found him within half an Hour , in Fleet street , at the White-Horse-Inn , and as we were carrying him before Sir Richard Brocas , I asked him if he knew one John Sharp ? He said yes , and told us that Sharp was going to France , because he had done something that prick 'd his Conscience . After the Prisoner was committed to the Compter , we went to him there , and asked him about the Robbery . He own 'd he was there the Tuesday and Saturday , when the House was robb 'd , and was conceal 'd 4 Hours in the Cellar . He told us , that Sharp let him in about 7 , and hid him in the Cellar 'till 11 , and then Mr. Bottomley went out . We asked him about the Cloaths ; he said he saw them , but he had no Hand in that Affair . We desired to know who had ? And he told us he was so 'frighted he could not tell . Carter he said was the Man that carry 'd them off , and he saw them all go , and knew they were stole , and were to be lodged in Carter 's Cellar . He own 'd likewise that he was up 2 pair of Stairs , after Mr. Bottomley was gone out , but he could not tell what was become of the Cloaths that were taken away . Q . Did he say only that he was above , 2 pair of Stairs ? Sweetland . He said it was done by Consent of all three , - himself Sharp and Cadmore . Stephen Brown , Constable . When the Prisoner was sent to the Compter , I went for Mr. Keate and Mr. Bottomley , and we all went to him in Prison ; there he confess 'd to us that Cadmore , Sharp , and himself had consulted to rob Mr. Bottomley , and that according to the Consultation , he was present both Times when the House was robbed . He said he did not know what was become of the Cloaths , only that they were carry 'd away by Carter , who keeps an Herb Cellar in Dyot-street . Defence . Sharp asked me to come to see him , I did , and while I was in the House Cadmore came in ; Sharp and Cadmore went out together , and lock 'd me in 'till they came back , while I was in the House , I saw them bring down some Cloaths , and put them into a Coach , but where the Coach carry 'd them I can not tell . He afterward told me that Cadmore had run away with 5 l of his Money , and bid me come on Saturday Morning to him . When I came , he bid God bless me , and told me he was going to France ; so we went to drink together at the Red-Lion , and there he asked me to go Home with him again . I did so , and saw 2 Bundles in the Parlour ready ty 'd up in a green Cloth , and this Carter and Sharp were both together in the House , and when I went away , I saw Carter with the Bundle on his Head . I am as innocent as the Child in the Womb . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 31. Henry Lyford , of St. Andrews Holborn , was indicted for that he on the 8th of July in the 10th Year of his Majesty 's Reign , in the Parish of Acton , took to Wife Elizabeth Wynne , and to her was then and there married , and afterwards , viz . on the 24th of June last in the Parish of Paddington , feloniously ; took to Wife Mary Hinton , Spinster , his former Wife being then in full Life . The Councel for the Prosecution set forth , that the Prisoner had marry 'd one Wynne , a Widow , on the 8th of July 1736 , and while she was alive , it happen 'd that Miss Hinton and her Mother took Lodgings , in his House . That the Defendant got into young Mrs. Hinton 's Acquaintance , and knowing that she was entituled to Money , he inveigled her to marry him . That he never asked the Consent of her Trustees , but prevailed upon her to marry him without it ; after which the Trustees hearing something of the first Marriage , they satisfied themselves of the Truth of it , and then tax 'd him with it . He denied it , but they told him they could produce not only the Certificates both of his first and second Marriage , but the very Affiadavit he made of his being a Batchelor when he took out the Licence in order to marry the second Wife , and tho ' the Prisoner had pleaded not Guilty , yet they should bring such clear Evidence of both Marriages , as would plainly prove him to be Guilty . Thomas Knowles . I was present at the Prisoner 's Wedding at Acton Church ; he was there marry 'd to Mrs. Elizabeth Wynne , in July 1736 , and I saw her alive within these 2 Months . Councel . Are you not positive you have seen her within these 6 Weeks ? Knowles . I wo n't say that ; but I 'll swear I have seen her within these 2 Months , at the House where I lodge , in Kings Head Court , by the King's-Head-Tavern in Holborn . Councel . And what Name did she then go by ? Knowles . By the Prisoner 's Name - Lyford . Councel . Did they live together as Man and Wife ? Knowles . Yes ; for near a Twelvemonth . The Reverend Mr. Brook Saunders . I marry 'd Henry Lyford and Mary Hinton , at Paddington , the 24th of June last . I believe the Prisoner is the Man . They were marry 'd by the Names of Henry Lyford , Batchelor , and Mary Hinton , Spinster . Here is the Register-Book . Prisoner 's Councel . As the second Wife is by Law admitted to be a Witness , she is the best Evidence , whether there was a second Marriage or not . For them to prove it only by Circumstances , and not produce the Woman , is against the Course of the Law . Says the Doctor - I believe the Prisoner is the Man , and why , - because I suppose him to be so . The Law in Penal Cases requires the best Evidence , and I believe the Gentlemen on the other side , ca n't shew that ever there was a second Marriage prov 'd , without the Evidence of the 2d Wife . Councel 's Prosecutor . I believe this is the first Time that the second Wife 's Testimony was ever call 'd the best Evidence . In this Case , the young Woman has thought fit to chuse the Prisoner for a Husband ; the Fear of losing him might exasperate her , but these Persons which we call , must be allow 'd to be unbias 'd , and to be indifferent Witnesses . Mr. Saunders . I believe the Prisoner is the Man I marry 'd to Mary Hinton , at Paddington , by Licence . I have the Licence here , and this is my Hand-writing ; I always back the Licences myself . Prisoner 's Councel . Are you sure it was Mrs. Hinton that you marry 'd ? Mr. Saunders . Yes ; and I should know her again if I was to see her . C. Have you seen either of the Parties before ? Mr. Saunders . Yes : I believe I have ; but not to know them before I recollect the Prisoner 's Person , now . Councel You never make any Entries here of Marriages , but what are real ? Mr. Saunders . No , Sir . Clerk reads . Marriages and Burials . June the 24th , 1737 . Henry Lyford , of St. Andrew 's Holborn , Middlesex , Bachelor , and Mary Hinton , of the same Parish , Spinster . Per Licence . By the Reverend Mr. Saunders Counc . Who made that Entry ? Mr. Saunders . The Parish Clark ; but I inspect the Register myself . Counc . And have you any other Reason to assert this Marriage , but from this Licence ? Mr. Saunders . Seeing the Prisoner , I can recollect his Person . I told the Attorney , that I had marry 'd a Person of that Name , by the Archbishop 's Licence . Prisoner 's Councel . Suppose now you had not seen this Book , should you have remember 'd you marry 'd such a Person ? Mr. Saunders . Yes to be sure ; and the Woman I should have known particularly . Thomas Abingdon I am Clark of Paddington Parish , and I believe the Prisoner is the Person that was marry 'd the 24th of June last to Mary Hinton . I believe he is the very Man . Q . Was there any other Marriage that Day ? Abingdon . No . They were marry 'd by this Gentleman - Mr. Saunders : And I made the Entry of this particular Marriage , within a Day or two after . Prisoner 's Councel . Do you know Mrs Hinton ? Abingdon . No ; I never saw her before , nor since . Christopher Gibson : I went to spend an Evening , some Time since , at Mr. Ross 's , and there I saw Mr. Adams and Mr. Latewood : They pull 'd out the Certificates of these two Marriages , and I read them . Mr. Lyford and Mrs. Hinton were sent for , and he declar 'd he was marry 'd to her . I charged him with being marry 'd to Mrs. Wynne ; he said , he had no other Wife but Miss Hinton , and she was present the same Time . A Constable was sent for , in Order to his being charged with the Prisoner ; but he deny 'd the first Marriage , and when we read the Certificates to him , he said , he did not Care a Farthing for them ; we might bring twenty of them , if we pleased . He deny 'd the first Marriage , but the second , he always acknowledged , and said to Mrs. Hinton - my Dear , I have no other Wife in the World but you . Prisoner 's Councel . Pray was you before a Magistrate , that had any Authority to ask these Questions , or was it only among yourselves ? Mr. Gibson . 'T was among ourselves . Mrs. Hinton , Widow . I know that Man at the Bar , to be Henry Lyford . On the 24th of June last , my Daughter was up sooner than ordinary , and went out . She did not come Home all Night - not 'till the next Night at Eight o'Clock . Then she came up Stairs to my Bed-side , and fell on her Knees . I asked her where she had been all Night ? She told me , at Islington - to take a Lodging . What have you to do , said I , to take a Lodging ? She then said - why , Madam , to be plain with you , I am marry 'd Marry 'd ! says I - to whom ! to Mr. Lyford , Madam , said she . And presently the Prisoner came up , and he fell on his knees , to ask my Blessing . I shut the Door against him , and immediately did up my Things , and went out of the House . Q . Has your Daughter ever come Home to you since ? Mrs. Hinton . No . Mr. Adams About the Beginning of July last , Mr. Lyford sent a Person to my House , to ask my Consent for his marrying this Girl : And afterwards he came himself . I told the Man , and him too , that I would not give it . I asked Lyford ( when he came himself ) whether he was not marry 'd to Miss Hinton already ? He said , yes , he was marry 'd to her . Then , says I , what signifies my Consent , if you are marry 'd already . I heard him own this second Marriage , at Mr. Ross 's ; and we had a Suit in Chancery , relating to some Part of Miss Hinton 's Fortune ; and when it was over , Lyford came and demanded the Writings in Right of his Wife . After this , we heard he was marry 'd to another Woman , and we got Certificates from the Ministers of the Churches , where he had been marry 'd : Upon which we sent to Miss Hinton , to desire her to come to us alone , for we had something to communicate to her , at Mr. Ross 's House ; but her Husband and she came together , and Mr. Gibson happen 'd to come in just before them . When the Prisoner and his Wife came in , we desired her to walk into another Room , and there we shew 'd her the Certificates ; then we called him in , and Miss Hinton charg 'd him with being marry 'd to another Woman ; he deny 'd it ; and upon that , we shew 'd him the Certificates - why , says he , what are they to me ? You may bring twenty of them , if you please . She fell a Crying , and call 'd him Names , and he said - what signifies it ? I have no other Wife in the World but you . Prisoner 's Councel . I apprehend , that this Evidence is not to be received ; and that in a Case of Felony , so penal , and ignominious as this is , the best Proof ought to be brought to support the Charge . I have been concern 'd in many Prosecutions on this Statute , and I submit it to the Court , whether the second Wife is not the most competent Witness , and whether she was not always call 'd , to prove the second Marriage And the Reason of it is - that when there happens to be any Dispute about the Identity of a Marriage , the Jury may be fully convinced , that the Person accused , is the very same Person who did the Prejudice , nor justifiable by Law . And because the second Wife is not a legal Wife , she is always admitted an Evidence . The second Wife , in this Case , ca n't be mistaken ; if they had produced her , she might have said - This was the Man that actually married me at Paddington , and then this corroborating Evidence would have come in well . I apprehend a Man 's Calling a Woman - his Love , - and his Dear , - and his Honey , are Circumstances not to be depended upon ; and that on this Penal Statute , if there is a Possibility of having positive Evidence , no circumstantial and bare presumptive Evidence ought to be admitted ; for it may happen , that two People may go and be married in the Names of two other Persons , and take ten or twelve People to be present , and it may happen that these very Persons may be call 'd upon to prove a Marriage upon the People whose Names had been made use of ; they can come and say , - I believe such Persons were married , and at such a Place , because I was present , and heard two Persons of such Names married . In this Case the Prosecutors have it in their Power to produce the second Wife , and I submit it , whether a second Marriage has ever been proved without the Evidence of the second Wife . Counc .

September 21 . Daniel Oscullin . On the 21st of September , between five and six in the Morning , I heard a Noise at my Master Heweys Door in Aldermanbury , so I jump 'd out of Bed , and opened the Door in my Shirt ; the old Gentleman at the Bar was at the Door , but seeing me open it , he was going off with all Expedition ; I resolved to go after him , and intended to have laid hold of the Knob on the Outside of the Door to pull it too . - but the Knob was gone . As he made off I heard something rattle in his Pocket , so I followed him , and asked him what he wanted at my Master 's Door ? He said he wanted nothing ; but I laid hold of him by the two Shoulders and gave him a Shake or two , and though he is an old Man , yet I can assure you he made a stout Resistance before he submitted . Then he begged I would let him go , but I told him he was a Villain , and that if he would not come back with me I would use him ill ; I was obliged to be expeditious with him , because I had left the Street Door o'jar to follow him , and I was uneasy and afraid some of his Gang might get into the House while I was disputing with him ; therefore I gave him another good Shake , and while I shook him , I saw the Brass Knob which he had wrenched from my Master 's Door , drop from him on the Ground ; I saw it fall , but I did not care to stoop for it , for I found him a stout Fellow , and was afraid , he might either get away , or knock me down while I was taking it up ; so I brought him back to my Master 's Door , and he run himself up , over the Window of our Small Beer Cellar , which is covered with an Iron Grate . While he stood over this Window he dropped this Instrument , - here 's a little Hook , - with which he hung it to his Girdle under his Great Coat . I saw it fall from him , and was exasperated . I told him that he was mistaken - that Instrument could not fall through the Bars ; and I swore I would use him ill if he resisted me , or refused to come into the House ; so I got him in , and called out to one of my Fellow-Servants . Upon examining his Pockets we found - all these Brass Knobs upon him , this in particular is my Master Hewey 's , and I saw him drop it ; I did not stay to take it up myself , but a Carpenter coming by and seeing me engaged with the Old Gentleman , he bid me hold the Old Thief fast , and he would bring me the Knob , which he accordingly did , and told me if I wanted help , he would assist me . When we had secured the Old Man , we sent for a Constable , and as soon as we could , we carried him before Alderman Brocas , who asked him how he came by that Collection of Knobs ? ( there was a Brass Knocker or two among them ) The Prisoner told him he found them as he went down to Thames-street , he found them in a Parcel of Straw . This very Knob I swear to , - 't is my Master 's , I saw it drop from him , and I 'll pick it out from five hundred . Prisoner . As for that Instrument I know nothing of it , it was standing at the Door before I came there . I have been Lame these Thirty Years , and have a Fistula in Ano upon me - That Man swears to the Knob , - why the Knobs , my Lord , are all alike , and how can he swear to one in particular so positively ? I found them all under a Bench . And now , - as to the Instrument , - he says 't was hook 'd to my Girdle , - why , he held both my Hands , - then how could I dropt it ? Jury . Did you see the Instrument drop from him , or did you see it only on the Ground ? Oscullin . When I had got him over the Cellar Window , I easied his Right Hand , and perceiv 'd him immediately busy with it . - I actually saw it drop upon the Grate , and told him , that it would not fall thro ' the Bars , and that I would stoop and take it up for him .
