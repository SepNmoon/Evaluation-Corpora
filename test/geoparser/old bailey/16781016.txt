LONDON : Printed for L. C. 1678 . The Proceedings at the Sessions , holden for London and Middlesex FOr satisfaction to the Publick , and more immediately to those persons concern 'd , but especially to expose Villany , and deter vitious persons from lewd practices by the fatal examples of those who have pursued such vile courses , is this true Narrative of these criminal proceedings published ; which be pleased to take as follows . The first Tryal regardable , was of a young Man for killing a Gunsmith in St. Martins in the fields , on the 7th of August last . The Prisoner waiting on a Gentleman that had sent several brace of Pistols thither to trim up , coming into the Shop to look after them , takes up one , not imagining it to be charged , and holding it forth that way where the youth deceased was at work , on a sudden it went off , and shot him in the left thigh , making a wound three inches deep , whereof , sometime after , he dyed . There appeared not the least malice , but on the contrary , a great deal of love and kindness between them , so that the Jury reciting the whole matter by a special Verdict , found that he did it involuntarily , casually , and by misfortune . But the next Arraignment appear 'd far more black and Tragical . A Man on the last day of August , at Kensington , picking a causeless quarrel with another , without any provocation that could be made appear , would needs fight with him ; and often with horrid Oaths , swore he would have satisfaction , or else he would stick him . The party afterwards killed , was then in drink , and finding himself thereby incapacitated , gave good words , desiring him to stay till the Morning , and then he would give him what satisfaction he would have ; and set another person to perswade him to that purpose : but nothing would prevail , needs he would fight , and so into the fields together they go . As they passed , a young man heard the person now dead , say , We were better go back and drink a pot of Ale , than fight now ; whereupon , he observed them the more , and saw them go over a stile , the Prisoner helping over the other , he was so much in drink : then the Prisoner drew his Sword , and urged the other to do so too ; but he refused , and stood still with his Arms folded ; whereupon , the Prisoner swore , If he would not draw , he would kill him ; and accordingly gave him a wound in the Breast . Then the evidence being on horseback , at a distance , call 'd to him , desiring him to forbear his Sword , and rather bang him soundly , that might not prejudice his Life : but still he swore , he would kill him ; and the other repeated , That at present he was not in a condition to answer him , but next morning he would answer him : with which nothing satisfied , the Prisoner made four thrusts more at him , and killed him on the place ; for which cruel and unmanly Action , having nothing material to alleadge in excuse , he was found guilty of Felony and Murder , and justly received sentence of Death . Two Women and a Man were tryed for a Burghlary in the Parish of Paddington , on the 27th of September last : the Evidence swore positively , that between two and three of the clock in the night , the two Women at Bar , and four Men , came to his House , broke open his door , and the Men entring , knockt him down , grievously abused his Wife , that she still remains sick ; and his Mother then lying ill , they so ill intreated , that she was immediately taken speechless , and soon after dyed ; then they rifled the House , took two Gold-rings , several parcels of Linnen and Cloaths , and 6 s. 6. d. in Money , which they flung forth to the Women that staid without : and the Witness swore , that they were the now Prisoners , whom he well knew before , and it being then Moon-light could plainly discern ; but as for the Men , he knew none of them . These Women were acquainted with the House , and one of them had been there the morning before , and seen most of the things afterwards taken , andwere persons of ill fame ; one had haunted Newgate , the other formerly transported from Barkshire Goal , and came over again before the time limited , upon whom a blue Apron , part of the Goods lost , was taken ; so that they were found guilty of the Felony and the Burghlary , and Condemned . As for the Man , little being proved against him , only that he brought one of them over from Virginia , he was brought in not guilty , but order 'd not to be discharged without sureties for the good behaviour . A Woman Indicted for stealing certain Cravats , and other Linnen , from a Gentleman whose House was burnt in the late Fire at Ratcliff ; it not appearing they were taken with any felonious intent , but rather snatcht up in a hurrey , being then helping away with Goods of greater moment , was discharged . A Yorkshire Lass , having to gratifie a sweet tooth mistaken a sugar-loaf from a Grocer 's , was found guilty to the value of ten pence , and ordered to be severely whipt . 'T is like she had not been discovered , but that when her hand was in , she went to another shop , and setting down her prize sugar-loaf on the Counter , was going to steal a suit of Flannel for Burial , as if she intended to carry some Trophies of her ingenuity into the next World with her : but the Gentlewoman of the shop spying her , prevented that exploit , and suspecting the sugar ill come by , charged a Constable with her ; whereupon , the Grocer heard of the business , & c. A Footman Indicted for stealing a great quantity of wearing Apparel , Perriwigs , & c. being instructed in the Newgate Doctrine , pleaded guilty to all others within Clergy , and was fairly burnt in the hand . Two Men tryed on suspition of stealing 22 l. 15 s. out of an Inne at Branford , on the second of this instant October . The Prisoners and two others came in and shifted a back-room to to go up stairs , pretending they waited to see some friends come by ; over against the Room they were in , was a lodging Chamber , lockt , but the key on the outside of the door : after spending two shillings , away they went ; the other two unknown , it seems had Horses in the Town , but the Prisoners took into aStage-Coach . The Master of the House , immediately after they were gone , misses his Money , which he saw but that morning , and knows of no company there but them ; overtaking the now Prisoners in the Coach , he charged them ; who highly pleaded innocence , that neither of them knew one of the other men , and had so little acquaintance with the other , as not to know where to find him ; that she said stranger only was out of the room , which the witness confirmed , acknowledging , he saw him down stairs : so that nothing being taken upon them , nor any more direct proof made against them , they were discharged . A lusty fellow was Condemned for a Robbery on the Highway ; the case was thus : On the 10th of April last , a Gentleman of my Lord of Oxfords Troop riding alone between London and Branford , about nine a Clock at Night , near Turnham-Green , on a suddain , a person starting out of an hedge , lays hold of his Bridle ; and before he could ask the reason , some others behind , knockt him off his Horse , which , with saddle , bridle , and holsters , they took away , and rifled his pocket ; though by good fortune , being going home , he had at that time but twelve pence about him ; his Horse being turned loose , he afterwards heard of in a Pound ; and some time after , going to re accoutre himself , met with his own saddle at one shop , and Loliters at another : these two Sadlers he Indicted the last Sessions ; but they were quitted proving the buying of the Goods ; and one of them afterward Seiz 'd the Prisoner , who sold the saddle to him , coming to sell him another saddle ; so that now it lay on him wholly to make appear how he came by it : of which he could give no good account , nor of his course of livelihood or conversation ; and besides , was trap 'd in several different stories , so that the Jury thought fit to find him guilty of the Robbery , on which he was Condemned . Another was Indict 'd on presumption of having stoln a brown Mare from a person unknown ; he brought her to the Red Lion Inn at Mile-end-green and exposed her to sale ; but after a Gentleman had given him earnest and insisted to have her vouch 'd , or some account how he came by her , he could give none , butwould have voided the bargain , nor could yet make any proof that he had any propriety in her ; however , it not appearing directly that the Beast was stoln , the Jury acquitted him of the Felony . A young fellow on the 11th of July last , about nine at night , prying about a Gentlemans house in St. Andrews Holborn , observ 'd a Lady lay by a Mantua-Gown , and other rich cloaths in a low room ; and leaving his shooes at door , goes in and gets them up : but she hearing some noise , cry 'd out , and he was forc 'd to drop them in the street , and so was taken , found guilty , and burnt in the Hand . A person Convicted on a full evidence for stealing of a considerable quantity , at several times , of green sealing wax , was burnt in the hand . An Engraver Indicted a young man for taking away some Tools , and other small things , but could fix nothing but a pair of Buckles ; and of them the Prisoner gave a very good account , so that the prosecution being groundless , he was acquitted . As were likewise a Man and his Wife charged with two Felonies by certain people that had been their Lodgers , which upon examination , appeared wholly frivolous , and the Indictments to have been brought in revenge of an action the now Prisoners had formerly brought against the Prosecutors , who received a severe check from the Court for such their practice . An old fellow that acts sometimes the part of an Hocus , or shewer of Tricks , was Indicted of High Treason for Clipping : coming to an Ale-house for a pint of drink , he offered a clipt Shilling , which the Victualler misliking , Here , says he , is another , shewing one much worse , and both new Clipt ; whereupon , an Officer searcht him , and found a parcel of new Clippings about him , and in his Lodging a melting pot , Sizzars that would do the feat , and a smoothing stone . All he had to alleadge was , that he took the two shillings at London-bridge , and had the Clippings unknown to him , amongst certain things he took in pawn for 5 s. which he lent a certain person that he named , but could not produce . The circumstances seemed veryclose and hard upon him , but not sufficient to prove him guilty ; so he was acquitted . Two other persons of good credit were questioned for the like Crime . Against one , nothing appeared in proof ; as to the other , there happened to come to his hand a parcel of Money , wherein was a great quantity Clipt , but he gave a fair account whence he had it ; nor was it possible by circumstances he could Clip it , or to discover who did , so that they were cleared , and the Money ordered to be melted down . A woman keeping a Publick house in James-street , Westminster , indicted a lusty young Coach-man that had lodg 'd there a twelvemonth , for ravishing her on Saturday the 27th of July , after her Husband and the rest of the Family were gone to bed . She swore the necessary Circumstances very home , but no body heard her Cry out . The fellow lay in their house several nights after , and ( as was proved by divers ) drank with her and her Husband on the Sunday and Monday following , and afterwards paid them a parcel of Money he owed them ; and then they served him with a Warrant on this business : So that on the whole matter , the Jury did not think fit on the Evidence before them , to bring him in guilty of so vile and capital a Crime . Nine persons , Officers of several Parishes in Surrey , were indicted concerning the Death of a poor man , that having gone down to work , and being taken Ill , was to be carried home to Westminster by a Pass . It was alleadged , that their unseasonable Conveying him contributed to his End , being in so weak a condition : But there did not appear any wilful Default in them ; so that they were Accquitted . Yet not without a necessary Caution to such persons , to be more careful for the future , not to hurry poor people out of their Parishes to the hazard of their Lives ; but to provide for them in such cases according to their Duty . There were in all Nine persons Condemned to Dye , Six Men , and Three Women , viz . a Souldier for Murder , two Men for Horse-stealing , one for a Robbery on the High-way ; two old Thieves , one of them having been burnt in the Hand , and the other had often had Mercy , and was so impudent to go into a Gentlemans House at noon-day , and steal Goods and Plate of great value , being taken in the manner ; two Women for a Burglary , and another guilty of stealing Goods above the value of ten shillings , by her own Confession . There were likewise Six Burnt in the Hand , that is to say , one for stealing a Velvet Saddle , of twenty shillings price . Another for stealing Cloaths from his Master , to the value of Forty two pounds , by his own Confession . Two for stealing a silver Tankard of the value of Eleven pound , in S. Martins Parish . Another for stealing Clothes and Thirty shillings in money out of York-buildings , on Octob . 20 . 1677 . Another for stealing Goods of great value , by his own Confession . And one set aside for Transportation .
