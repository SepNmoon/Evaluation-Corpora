THE TRUE NARRATIVE OF THE PROCEDINGS AT The Sessions-House IN THE OLD-BAYLY . Which began on Wednesday the 21th of this instant April , 1680. and ended on Fryday the 23th . following . Giving an Account of most of the Remarkable Trials there , viz . for Treasons , Murders , Fellonies and Burglaries , & c. with a particular Relation of their Names , and the places of their Committing their Facts , with the number of those Condemned to dye , burnt in the hand , and to be whipt . With the Condemnation of a notorious Jesuite , and of the three Women to be burnt , and the proceedings with the Apprentices . The first that we shall give account of is an Irish Youth , who was Arraigned and tryed for Robbing his Master of about fifty pounds in Goods and money , the circumstances thus , that the Prisoner being taken into service , and brought up by the Gentleman now Robbed , in Ireland , who coming over into England , took a house in the Strand , the Youth observing the place where he laid his Money , took an opportunity one Morning betimes , to come into his Chamber softly , and opening his Cabinet . with a false Key , took thence forty pounds in Silver , and three twenty shilling pieces of Gold , and immediately went to Bristol , and there under the Name of a Servant to a person of Honour , he endeavoured to take shipping for Ireland , but upon grose suspicions , being apprehended , the Robbery was made plain , the Gold and a good part of the Silver , being taken about him , his plea was , that he had the moneys by a Bill of Exchange from his Father , but could not make it out , so that all Circumstances cosidered , he was found Guilty of the Fellony . Henry Wether was Indicted for stealing a Mare from John Hall in the Parish of St. Martins in the Fields , vallued at 7 pounds , the which he having sold to another for 3 pounds down , and 3 at Midsummer , was seised in the Custody of the Buyer , so that he makind immediate search for his Chapman , found him in a Strong-water shop in Long-Acre , where Apprehending him he was committed , and upon his Tryal it appeared that he had received the Mercy of Transportation , so that upon full Evidence he was Convicted of the Crime . Edward Harrison was Inddicted and Arraigned for Felloniously murthering of one John Jacob , on Shrove munday last in King-street Westminster ( for now of late that Scarlet Crime is grown so frequent , that it commonly concludes mutual friendship in such a Trajeck Scene , that might far better befit Pagangs than protestors of Christianity ) the manner of this fatal mischief was according to the Evidence produced in Court as followeth , the deceased and the Prisoner having had several fallings out in relation that the Prisoner was too familliar with the wife of the deceased , whereupon he had often threatned to put a period to his Life or loose his own , so that often having way laid him and fallen upon him at unawares , not only with unlawful Staves , but with his sword endeavoured to surprise him but his designs not taking their wished for event , but hindered by Providence for perpetrating such a Cruel in till the Saturday before this Trajedy was compleated , the aforementioned Harrison having sent for Jacobs wife , after being strictly warned to the contrary , it so grieved him , that as it is said vowed revenge , and waiting for the coming home of the Prisoner about ten of the Clock , and no sooner having met him , but as the Prisoner pleaded , he drew upon him , making many passes , which were put by and avoided by the Prisoners retreating to his own house , but the other still pursuing him , he was obliged to draw and stand upon his Guard which with two mortal wounds on the brest about four inches deep made him fall breathless at his feet but notwithstanding the Jury upon weighing all circumstances thought fit to find him guilty of Manslaughter . Charles Sancy a Frenchman was ttied likewise for robbing his Brother Mounsier of twenty-eight French Pistols , 6 Meddals with Coats of Arms upon them , by breaking open as he alleged , his Trunks in his absence , the party robbed could speak no English , and so obliged to have an Interpreter , that the Court might be sensible of his Evidence , the Fellony was plain for Sancy confessed he had taken twelve Pistols , but the Burglary being somewhat dubious , he was only found guilty of the Fellony . William Harding was tried also for Ravishing one Sarah Southy a Girl about 7 or 8 years of Age , ticeing her down into a dark Cellar by the allurement of Appels , and then accomplished his detestable Villany , not only giving the Child the foul Disease wherewith himself was infested , but likewise by forceable penetrating her Body , so abused her secret parts , that the distressed wretch remained in a most miserable condition , but long was it e 're she would complain , lest her Mother should beat her ; but at last her extream torment enforced her to it , the which her mother no sooner understood , but she procured a couple of Chirurgions that they might if possible retract the mischance ; who did conclude that she had been forced , which she her self confessed at large ; and he having been a ey debauched fellow , for as the Witness swore in Court , he was wont to Act carnally with his own mother , threatning when she refused to permit his incestious desires , to Fire the house about her Ears , and when he was searched , several Simptoms of the Venereal Distemper was seen to remain , so that the Jury brought him in guilty of the Rape .
