It appear 'd , that sixty Firkins of Butter were landed near the Custom-House Key , for the Prosecutor ; one of them was between Three and Four in the Morning taken from thence by the Prisoner , who was stopt with it under the Custom-House Gate by Philip Harrison , ( a Tide-waiter . ) Harison had but just eased the Prisoner of his Burden , when Peacock ( a Watchman on the Keys ) came up and claim 'd a Share of the Seizure ; for both he and Harrison at first imagined the Prisoner to be a Smugler ; but finding their Mistake , they carry 'd him to the Watch-house , and the next Day he was committed to Newgate by Sir Francis Forbes . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that he found the Butter upon the Keys , about Four in the Morning and added , ( to make his Innocence more visible ) that a Carman 's Boy saw him take it away .

Andrew 's , Holborn , was indicted for privately stealing out of the Shop of Mary Toothaker , 12 Yards of Scarlet Ribbon , value 6s . on the 30th of October last . Mary Toothaker deposed , that the Prisoner and two more came into her Shop , next the Cross-Keys Tavern in Holborn , to buy a Cross-Knot ; at which time she saw the Prisoner take the Goods in the Indictment , and go away ; but having no body to take care of her Shop , she did not pursue her , for fear the others in the mean time should rob her of something more valuable : But two Weeks after , she saw the Prisoner again , and causing her to be apprehended , she confess 'd she had pawn 'd them for 2s . at a Chandler 's Shop in Plumb-Tree Court in Holborn ; at which Place the Goods were found . Guilty to the Value of 10d . Transportation . Benjamin , alias William Baker , of S. Mary Colechurch , was indicted for privately stealing a Hat , value 10 s. the Goods of Robert Pead ; and a Hat , value 5s . the Goods of Edward Vergow , out of the Shop of the said Robert Pead . It appear 'd that the Prisoner came into the Shop of the Prosecutor , ( an Apothecary ) and ask 'd for a Halfpennyworth of Spanish Liquorish . Vergow , the Prosecutor 's Servant , who was in the Back-Shop , came out and told him , they did not use to sell such small Quantities ; with which Answer the Prisoner went away , and Vergow immediately missing his Master 's Hat , and his own , ( both which before hung on the Pegs in the Shop ) he pursued the Prisoner . His Master 's Hat , with four more , he found in a Basket which the Prisoner had on his Shoulder , and his own Hat under the Prisoner 's great Coat . The Prisoner , to excuse himself , said , that he had bought the Hats but just before , and call 'd John Baker to his Reputation , who deposed , that he was a Gardener at the Old Rose in Marybone , had known the Prisoner 20 Years , and had often employ 'd him in his Business , but never knew him guilty of any Dishonesty . But the Fact being plainly proved upon the Prisoner , and his Defence being frivolous , the Jury found him guilty to the Value of 4s . 10d . Transportation . Sarah Hughs , of S. Sepulchre 's , was indicted for feloniously stealing six Pewter Plates , value 6s . and other Things , the Goods of John Medley .

Dorothy Thompson , was indicted for feloniously stealing a Linnen Sheet , value 7s . and several Diaper Clouts , value 2s . the Goods of Samuel Walter , on the 14th of November last . Barbara George deposed , that being a Nurse at Mr. Walter 's , a Druggist , in Cheapside , where the Prisoner was a Servant , she often missed some of the Child 's Clouts in washing , but could never think what became of them , till one day she happened to find the Maid 's Petticoat , which was made of the same Clouts that before had been missing . And upon further Search , found a Gown of her 's that was lined with part of the Prosecutor 's Sheet . The Prisoner confessed the Fact before Sir John Fryer , and said that she threw the remaining part of the Sheet down the Vault , to prevent a Discovery , having dream 'd that her Mistress had found out what she had done . But this she deny 'd at the Bar , and said that that Gown was lined with two of her own Aprons , and that she had the Petticoat before she came to the Prosecutor 's Service . Her Confession was read in Court , and the Jury found her guilty to the Value of 10 d. Transportation . Edward Templeman , of S. Ann 's near Aldersgate , was indicted for privately stealing from the Person of Robert Ray , a Silk Handkerchief , value 1s . the Goods of Robert Ray . And also for privately stealing 4 more Handkerchiefs , the Goods of Persons unknown . Robert Ray deposed , that coming out of S. Ann 's Church on Sunday Night , he miss 'd his Handkerchief , went back to see if he had not left it in his Seat ; and returning to the Door , he saw Mrs. Smith holding the Prisoner , and heard her say that he was a Pickpocket . Upon which he was taken into the Vestry and search 'd . Four Handkerchiefs were found upon him , and two lying at the Vestry-Door , one of which at last proved to be the Prosecutor 's . Mrs. Smith depos 'd , that seeing the Prisoner 's Hand in her Cousin D. Humphries 's Pocket , she clapt her Hand upon his , held him fast , and cried out , a Pickpocket , till the Beadle came and carried him into the Vestry . But there being no positive Proof that the Prisoner was the Person that dropt the Prosecutor 's Handkerchief at the Vestry-Door ; and no body owning any of the Handkerchiefs that were found upon him , the Jury acquitted him . Peter Crisp , of S. Ann 's , Blackfryers , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of Matth.ew Bond , and taking from thence 16 s. the Money of Matthew Bond , on the 20th of October last , in the Night Time . Matthew Bond being dry in the Night , he got up about Two o'Clock , and found all the Doors fast ; he returned to Bed , and rising again about 7 , found that his Shop Door and his Till were broke open , and the Money taken out . He called to Mr. Collier , and told him he was robbed , and it must be done by somebody in the House . Collier answered , I wish it is not Peter , for be went down to the Vault about Six this Morning They examined Peter , ( the Prisoner ) : He deny 'd it strongly at first , but afterwards said , if they would make the Matter up , he would pay them whatever they had lost , by so much a Week . Mr. Collier depos 'd , that he was a Looking Glass Polisher , lodged in Mr . Bond 's House , where the Prisoner work 'd Journey-work with him . That on the Night mentioned in the Indictment , the Prisoner having quarrel 'd with his Wife , he got Leave to lie for one Night in Mr.Bond 's Garret , with another Servant of Mr.Collier 's . About 4 in the Morning , the Prisoner and his Bedfellow got up to work , and about 6 the Prisoner said he was griped , and must go to the Vault . He went down , staid near a quarter of an Hour , and coming up again , told his Master Collier that he had found Mr . Bond 's Shop Door open , but that he had shut it again . The Evidence not fixing the Fact on the Prisoner , and he bringing some Witnesses to his Reputation , the Jury acquitted him . Mary Noon , of S. Dunstan 's in the West , was indicted for privately stealing from the Person of Tho . Burgess two Guineas and Half a Crown , on the 28th of November last . Tho . Burgess depos 'd , that as he was going by S. Dunstan 's Church in Fleetstreet , being indifferently drunk , the Prisoner and another Woman ran full against him , held him fast , and pickt his Pocket in half a Minute . He call 'd to the Watch ; upon which three or four Men came up , beat him , and threw him down ; but the Mob gathering , and the Watch appearing , the Men and one of the Women that assaulted him ran away ; but the Prisoner was secur 'd , and carry 'd to the Watch house . The Fact was plainly proved upon her : But the Indictment being laid for privately stealing , and this appearing to be an open Assault , the Jury found her guilty of the Felony only . Transportation . Ann Simpson , of Edgworth , was indicted for stealing out of the House of George Montague 18 Guineas , the Money of George Montague , and half a Yard of Sattin value 12 d. the Goods of Richard Brasier , on the 3d of November last . Jane Montague deposed , that on the 26th of October she put 80 Guineas into a Cup , and lock 'd it in her Father 's Cupboard , which was in his Bed-Chamber . That her Father , in the beginning of November , just before he went to Dunstable Fair , sent her up to fetch him some Money ; at which time she miss 'd 13 Guineas , but did not tell her Father for fear of Anger , nor her Sister till her Father was gone . When her father return 'd , he gave her some Money to lay up , and then she miss 'd 5 Gunieas more , of which she told her Sister . They then searched the Cupboard , and found that a Board on the top of it had been loosen 'd and taken up . Their Father died . They examined all the Servants ; but no body was more suspected than the Prisoner , because the Prosecutor being a Higler , was two or three Days in a Week at Country Fairs and Markets , and always left the Care of the House to the Prisoner , and the other Servants never used to go into her Father 's Room ; nor did they know that any Money was kept there . Mary Montague deposed to the same Effect , and added , that in searching the Prisoner 's Trunk , they found the half Yard of Sattin mentioned in the Indictment , which she produced in Court . Elizabeth Brasier deposed , that having bought a Piece of Sattin for a Suit , she left it at her Father Montagne 's , to the Charge of the Prisoner ; and fetching it away again when she went home to Bedford , and there sending for her Mantua-maker , they found it was half a Yard of Shorter than when she bought it . That the half Yard that was afterwards found in the Prisoner 's Trunk was exactly of the same kind , Stripe and Colour . The Prisoner in her Defence said , that none of the Rooms in the House were kept lockt ; that people were frequently coming in , and the other Servants often going up and down Stairs , and might know as well as the where the Money was kept . That she was busy a Washing when the Money was lost , and could not observe every body that came in and out . That the Sattin was given her two Years ago ; and that her Masters Daughters had several times bought new Cloths without his Knowledge ; and that he had often complain 'd of it , and said , he was at more Charges now than when his Wife was alive . The Jury acquitted her . Richard Thompson , alias Blackbeard , alias Evans of Thistleworth , was indicted for feloniously stealing a She Ass , value 5 l. a Ram 5s . and a tame Deer value 40 s. the Property of John Mead Esq ; on the 8th of August last . He was a second time indicted for a Misdemeanor in breaking into an enclosed Ground of John Mead Esq ; and killing two Fallow Deer , value 20s . on the 27th of October last . Mr. Mead depos 'd , that the Deer were lost out of his Ground at the Times mention 'd in the Indictment ; and he was soon after inform 'd , that the Prisoner was one of the Persons that stole them . Robert Brown of Brentford depos 'd , that the Prisoner told him , that in August last he and Tho James laid a Toil ( or Snare ) to catch Deer in Mr. Mead 's Park . The first that was caught in it was a She Ass , the next a Ram , and the third a tame Deer . They set the Ass and Ram at liberty , but took the Deer away , and sold it for 23s . to Richard Beck , a Porter in Aldersgate street , who frequently bought Venison that was stolen . That on the 27th of October last , about 9 at Night , the Prisoner , this Evidence , and Tho . James , met at the King's-Head at Eling , and from thence went together to Mr.Mead 's Park , and stole away a white Doe and a Fawn , which they brought to Smalbury-Green , and there this Evidence left the Prisoner . Robert Misselbrook , a Butcher , deposed , that in last August , falling into Discourse with the Prisoner about Deer-stealing , the Prisoner told him that he had taken one of Mr. Mead 's tame Deer , which he caught in a Toil . Mrs. Goodneighbour at the Two Cocks in Thistleworth , deposed , that the Night Mr.Mead 's tame Deer was lost , the Prisoner came to her House with a Toil in a Basket . The Prisoner in his Defence acknowledg 'd the killing of the two wild Deer in October , but deny 'd that he was concern 'd in taking the same Deer in August , any farther than that he knew the Persons that took it , because they had asked him to go with them ; but he refused them . The Jury acquitted him of the first Indictment , but found him guilty of the other . Fined . He was a 3d time indicted for stealing a black Gelding Value 5 l. the Goods of Ralph Farr , on the 1st of Oct. last . But Farr not appearing , he was acquitted . Constance Hales , and Elizabeth Nelson , alias Dixon , the Wife of John Dixon , were indicted for feloniously stealing a Silk Gown , value 10 s. a quilted Petticoat value 18 s. and a Dragget Coat and Wastecoat value 12 s. the Goods of James Mosely , on the 16th of November last . James Mosely depos 'd , that he lives in Well-close-Square ; that the Prisoners were his Lodgers , and that about Four in the Morning another of his Lodgers cry 'd out Thieves . He got up , ran down into the Yard , and there found his Wastecoat upon the Wall ; and afterwards going into his Closet , he miss 'd the other Goods in the Indictment , and suppos 'd them to be stolen by some body belonging to the House . Soon after Mrs. Shepherd , ( another of his Lodgers ) inform 'd him that his Goods were pawn 'd at Mrs Goodfellow 's in King-Street , Wapping ; and if he would apprehend James Goodwin and the two Prisoners , he might know more of the Matter . He thereupon apprehended Goodwin , ( who pass 'd for Hales 's Husband ) and had him committed to New-Prison ; but being set out upon Bail , he ran away . Jane Goodfellow depos 'd , that Hales , in Company with Nelson , brought the Goods to her House , and pawn 'd them for 12 s. 6 d. The Prisoner Hales in her Defence said , that Goodwin was her Country man , and coming to visit her , Mrs. Mosely told him , ( as it was common for her to tell any Man that came to her other Lodgers ) if he would pay for the Lodging , he should lie with her ( the Prisoner ) all Night ; but she refus 'd , and told her Landlady , that she had a Husband at Sea , and would not defile his Bed for the World . Goodwin soon after went away , and then Mrs. Shepherd call 'd the Prisoner , and said , Take your Landlady Mosely aside , and give her a Dram ; and in the mean time I 'll carry off her Box with the Rings in it : But she would not consent to it . However Shepherd brought out a Bundle of Cloaths : She desired Shepherd to carry them back to the Place she had them from ; but instead of that , Shepherd gave them to her Sister , who carry 'd them out to Goodwin , from whom the Prisoner Nelson took them , carry 'd them to pawn at Mrs. Goodfellow 's , and received the Money herself . Nelson in her Defence said , that she accidentally met Hales with a Bundle of Cloaths : Hales desired her to go with her to Goodfellow 's , which she did , and there Hales pawn 'd the Goods , and took the Money herself . The Jury found Hales guilty to the Value of 10 d. but the Evidence not reaching Nelson , she was acquitted . William Hicks and Robert Archer , of S. Andrew 's Holborn , were indicted for privately stealing , in the Shop of Tho . Parks , 36 Iron Hinges , value 35 s. and five Locks , value 5s . the Goods of Robert Parks , on the 24th of November last . Tho . Parks depos 'd , that he keeps a Smith 's Shop in Leather-Lane , and that the Prisoner Hicks was his Journeyman , and was intimate with Archer the other Journeyman , who was Prisoner to Daniel Carpenter , a Carpenter . That missing the Goods , he suspected the Prisoners , and upon Enquiry , found that Hicks , in Company with Archer , had sold the Goods mentioned in the Indictment to Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Panta . The Evidence not being sufficient against Archer , he was acquitted ; but Hicks was found guilty to the Value of 4s . 10 d. Transportation . John Randal , was indicted for privately stealing from William Woodroff a Handkerchief value 10d . on the 24th of October last . It appear 'd , that as the Prosecutor was coming out of the Playhouse in Drury-Lane , the Prisoner ran against him , and took the Handkerchief out of his Pocket . Mr.Shrimpton saw him commit the Fact , seiz 'd him , and he being searched , 4 other Handkerchiefs were found upon him . Guilty . Transportation . Elizabeth Morris , alias Mary Tipping , of S. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for feloniously stealing three Smocks value 10 s. the Goods of John Penny , on the 17th of November last . John Penny , Constable , depos 'd , that between One and Two in the Morning , the Prisoner was brought to him at the Watch-house , with a Bundle and a Box , and said that her Husband had beat her , and taken another Woman to Bed , and so she catch 'd up those Things to secure them at a Friend 's House . He bid her send for somebody to her Reputation , which she did , and two Women came and gave her the Character of an honest Woman , and that they believed the Goods were her own . However , he carry 'd her and her two Friends before the Justice , who finding nothing proved against her , discharged her . They then went to drink together , and afterwards came to his House , where she sent for three Quarts of Twopenny to treat him and her two Friends . While they were drinking , he was call 'd out , and at his Return found her at Dinner with his Wife . Mrs. Penny deposed , that after her Husband was gone , a Neighbour came in , who having some Knowledge of the Prisoner , fell into Discourse with her ; but in a little time the Prisoner appear 'd to be very drunk , and tumbled out of the Chair ; she rais 'd her again , carried her up Stairs , laid her upon the Bed , and very considerately set a Chamber-Pot by her , for fear she might have Occasion to make Water . This done , she left her , and in about half an Hour after , thinking she heard her rising , went up to see how she did , and found her kneeling on the Bed , with the Chamber-Pot betwixt her Legs . She seem 'd to be a little recover 'd , and upon Persuasion came down to Dinner , and after Dinner went away . Next day this Evidence miss 'd her Linnen , and suspecting the Prisoner , enquired after her of the Neighbour that accidentally met with her the day before ; by which means she found her , charged her with the Felony , and had her before Justice Kirby , to whom she confess 'd that she stole the Goods , part of which were found upon her , and the rest at Pawn . The Prisoner in her Defence said , that the Prosecutor 's Daughter came up Stairs , and beg 'd her to pawn those three Smocks for her , and bring her the Money . She pawn 'd them accordingly , and intended to bring her the Money next day ; but being very busy , was prevented . It appear 'd very unlikely that the Prosecutor 's Daughter should , on such a short Acquaintance , put so much Confidence in the Prisoner , especially when she saw her in such ill Circumstances . The Jury found her guilty . Transportation . Edward Betty , Katharine Betty , alias Cook , alias Macoon , and Katharine Keys , of S. Martin 's in the Fields , were indicted for breaking and entring the House of Robert Rawlings , on the 29th of October last , about the Hour of 12 at Night , and taking from thence a Gold Ring , set with Diamonds , Value 15 s. a Gold Ring Value 5 s. a Watch Value 30 s. five Silver handled Forks Value 30 s. a Silver Snuff-Box , Value 30s . six Silver Spoons Value 38 s. three Pair of Silver Buckles Value 6 s. a Pair of Gold Studs Value 8 s. a Silver Handled Knife Value 3 s. three Tortoiseshell-Snuff-Boxes Value 18 s. twelve Ells of Holland , 2 Neckcloths , 32 Ounces of Silver , Value 6 l. 6 Perukes Value 6 l. and 6 l. 6 s. in Money , the Goods and Money of Robert Rawlings and John Rawlings , and five Gold Rings Value 3 l. a Watch Value 10 s. a Pair of Ear-Rings , six Cane-Heads , one Silver Spoon , two Gowns , a Drugget Coat , and other Things , the Goods of Persons unknown . Robert Rawlings depos 'd , that on the 29th of Oct. last , he heard no Noise in the Night , but found next Morning that his House had been broke open , and the Goods in the Indictment taken away ; that the Entrance was made at the Cellar Window under the Shop Bulk , from whence they came up the Stairs , and forced off a Staple , into which the Bolt of the Door shut on the other side , and so got into the Shop . That on the 31st of the same Month , Jack Sheppard ( who has since been executed ) was taken with some of those Goods upon him , and Katharine Keys being in his Company when he was apprehended , they suspected her to be an Accomplice ; but she escaping then , and he having Intelligence where she lodged , went thither with some others in quest of her . When they came there , they were told she was gone to her Husband in Ludgate . They followed , found her , and told her they were come to search her Lodging . A Man that was with her would have had the key to have gone to her Lodging before them . She readily offered to give it him ; but the Prosecutor would not suffer it , thinking that his Design was to remove some of the Goods before any other came there . K. Keys then desired them not to expose her , and she would go with them quietly . They went , and there found 9 Ells of Gulix Holland , which appeared to be part of the 12 Ells which the Prosecutors had lost . By examining her , they understood that Kate Cook alias Macoon was another Acquaintance of Jack Sheppard 's , and that she and Ned Betty ( the other Prisoner ) frequently lay together lay together at his Lodging in Litchfield-Street . Thither they went with a Search Warrant , and found a Pair of the Prosecutor 's Shoes , but neither Kate Cook nor her Bedfellow . From thence they went to another Lodging that belong 'd to Cook in Cranborn-Alley , Leicester-Fields , where Kate Keys and she sometimes lived together , and of which Kate Keys had the Key . Here was likewise no body at home , but they found the Prosecutor 's Sword , the remaining 3 Ells of Holland , and a Basket with Thieving Tools , and Jack Sheppard 's Feetlocks and Handcuffs in it . Mr. Gowder , at the Dolphin Alehouse in Long Alley , Moorfields , depos 'd , that on the 3d of Nov. about six in the Morning , the Prisoners came to his House with a Bundle of Goods , and called for Drink . They were very earnest in whispering , and often mention 'd the Name of Jack Sheppard , which made him suspect the Goods were stolen . When they had drank 2 or 3 Pints , they went out to seek for a Lodging , and in the mean time this Evidence and his Man searched the Bundle , in which they found several Wigs , a Coat , Gown , Petticoat , and several other Goods tumbled together . This increasing his suspicion , he went for a Constable , and at his Return was inform 'd , that Ned Betty had been there again for the Bundle , and was just gone to the Black Dog , to which Place he went with the Constable and other Assistance , and there apprehended all the Prisoners . They found a Silver Handled Knife and Fork , a Silver Spoon , a Watch , Ring , and other Goods in Kate Cook 's Stockings . She confess 'd that she had them from Jack Sheppard , and added , with a vulgar double Entendre , that she was Jack Sheppard 's Washerwoman , and had many a time wash 'd his three Pieces betwixt her * * * . She farther told them , that Ned Betty was entirely innocent , for she had only hired him as a Porter to carry the Bundle . These Depositions being corroborated by other Witnesses , the Prisoners then made their Defence . Edward Betty protested that he was wholly ignorant of the Matter , that he was hired to carry the Bundle for a Shilling ; and as to the Shoos that were found at his Lodging , they were sent him by Kath Cook . Kath Keys in her Defence , said , that she was a Seamstress , and the Linnen that was found in her Room was brought her by a Gentleman to make him 3 Shirts . Kath Cook in Defence of herself and Ned Betty , said , that the Shoos were left her in Pawn , but the Owner never came to redeem them ; that she wash 'd Linnen for Ned , and he coming to her for a Shirt , and seeing the Shoos , desired her to lend them him , which she did : That he knew nothing of the other Goods which they were taken with in Long-Alley ; and that he never cohabited with her , as was reported . As to her own part , she said the Bundle was brought to her one Morning by a Coachman , whom she had no Knowledge of . She asked him who they belong 'd to ; but he would not tell her , but bid her take Care of them , and the Gentleman that own 'd them would be with her in the Evening . This Gentleman proved to be Jack Sheppard , who told her that they were his Wife 's Cloaths ; that she took Sheppard for a very honest Man , and did not in the least imagine that the Goods were stolen , till afterwards she heard that he was apprehended . She own 'd indeed that she had known Sheppard two Years , and that she became acquainted with him by living next door to his Master when he was an Apprentice ; and yet she pretended to be ignorant of his ever being in Newgate , tho his twice escaping from thence had been the common Discourse of the whole Nation . She then called two Witnesses to prove that she was not in Company with Sheppard that Night the Robbery was committed . Alexander Polson , at the Nag's-Head in Newport-Market , deposed , that on the 29th of October , between 9 and 10 at Night , Ned Betty , and Mr. Laycock ( a very sufficient Man ) came to drink at his House , and about to they were follow 'd by Kate Cook . Laycock went away about One in the Morning , and Ned and Kate in about half an Hour after . Mary Price , in Farmer's-Court in Dyers Street , near S. Giles 's Church , deposed , that on the 30th of October , about Two in the Morning , Ned Betty and Kate Cook came to her Lodging , and lay there ( but not together ) till 7 the same Morning . Each of the Prisoners call 'd several to their Reputation ; and the Burglary not being positively proved upon them , the Jury acquitted them . But the Court ordered the Prosecutor to bring a second Indictment against Cook and Keys for receiving the aforesaid Goods Pursuant to which , Katharine Cook was a second time indicted for a Misdemeanor in receiving the Goods of Robert Rawlings , knowing them to be stoln . The Depositions in the former Trial were repeated in this , with additional Proofs of her Intimacy with Sheppard , by her frequently coming to him when in Newgate , acknowledging that he had often lain with her , and confessing that she knew that the Goods which were found upon her in Long-Alley came from him . The Jury found her guilty . Fined and Imprison 'd . Katharine Keys was a second time indicted for receiving 9 Ells of Holland , the Goods of Robert Rawlings , knowing them to be stoln . Tho . Lewin deposed , that as he was coming with his Master from the Round-house with another Prisoner , he was told by a Boy that Sheppard was at a neighbouring Brandy Shop in Drury-Lane , against the End of Parker-Lane : He went directly thither , and rushing in between two Watchman , seized upon Sheppard , just as he was saying , I must go Landlady , for I can stay no longer . The Prisoner being there , immediately took hold of this Evidence 's Arm , and said , Hold , hold , where are you going to carry him ? The Linnen , as before deposed , was found at her Lodging , and she said at first that she had it from Kate Cook ; but afterwards that Sheppard brought it to her to make him some Shirts ; but that she did not know it was stolen . The Jury acquitted her . Mary Stratton , of S. Peter Cheap , was indicted for stealing 19 Yards of Tape , one Thousand of Pins , 10 Yards of Ribbon , and other Things , the Goods of Thomas Fletcher , on the 2d of December last .

It appeared that the Prisoner was Servant to the Prosecutor , ( at the Globe Alehouse on Fishstreet-Hill ) and went away with the Goods and Money , part of which was taken upon her , at the Bull Head in Leadonhall-Street . Guilty to the value of 10d . Transportation . Richard Okely , of S.Botolph 's Bishopsgate was indicted for stealing a Brass Cock , value 2 s. the Goods of the President and Governor of the Poor of the London Work-house .

John Elan and William Philips of S.Antholin 's , were indicted for privately stealing out of the Shop of Josiah Lambert , a Wig , the Goods of Thomas Trustan , on the 13th of Nov. last . It appeared that the Prisoners going to the Prosecutor 's Shop to have their Wigs powdered , and finding none but a Boy in the Shop , one of them stole the Wig , which being quickly miss 'd , and they pursued , it was taken upon Elan . The Jury found him guilty to the value value of 10 d. Transportation ; and acquitted Philips . Margaret Mace , of S. Brides , was indicted for privately stealing from John Hancock , a Gold Watch , value 13 l. on the 1st of Dec. last . John Hancock depos 'd , that having been drinking at the Globe Tavern in Covent Garden , he took Coach there , and ordered the Coachman to drive to his Lodgings , at Mr . Pain 's , a Brasier , at the Golden Lyon in Grace-Church-Street . The Coach stopt by the way , and he lost his Watch , but by what means he could not tell , he was so disordered with drinking . Daniel Andrews the Coachman deposed , that in Fleet-Street the Prosecutor got out of the Coach . Why do you get out here , Sir ? says the Coachman . Because I am at home , says Mr. Hancock . - No , Sir , you are in Fleet-Street . - Pray do n't you trouble yourself about that , but take your Money and begone , said he ; and taking out his Watch , offered it to the Coachman for his Fare . As they were in this Discourse , the Prisoner and another Woman came to the Coach , and seeing the Gentleman 's Watch in his Hand ; Come , my Dear , says one of them , let you and I go home to Bed together . The Prosecutor then put them both into the Coach , and this Evidence drove on to Ludgate-Hill , where the Women got out of the Coach , and one of them ran down the Old-Baily ; but he ( the Evidence ) jumping off the Coach-Box , stopt the Prisoner , and the Watch coming to his Assistance , secured her . Edward Jomes depos 'd , that the Prisoner three times offered him a Shilling to let her go ; but he refused , and carried her before the Constable , where she was searched ; but the Watch was not found upon her . The Prisoner in her Defence said , that coming from Wood-Street Compter , where her Husband was confined , she saw the Man and a Woman talking together at a Coach-Door , they asked her to go and drink , but she refused , and went on towards Fleet - Ditch , where a Man clapt her on the Shoulder , at which she was very much surprized ; and turning back , he charged her with taking a Gentleman 's Watch , of which she was then as innocent as she was at the Hour of her Birth . The Jury acquitted her . Penelope Adair , alias Bertless , alias Countess Spinello , alias Sylvia Anna Landina , of S. Mary Aldermary , was indicted for feloniously stealing 12 Gross and a half of Silk Lacing , value 8l . 324 Yards of Ribbon value 54s . 70 Yards of Silk Breed value 4l . 4 Gross of Silk Binding value 4l . the Goods of James Birch , on the 2d of Nov. last . Aaron Pritchard depos 'd , that he keeps a Warehouse at the Blue Leg in Bow-Lane , in the Quality of Factor for James Birch of Coventry . That the Prisoner had been a Lodger in his House , being recommended to him by Capt . Murray , who brought her over from Ireland , and told him she was the Daughter of Sir Robert Adair , Bart . and Widow of Count Spinello ; and that whatever Charges he was at on her Account , should be repaid him with Advantage : That he was as tender of her , as if she had been his Daughter ; sent her Money , bought fine Cloaths for her , made her welcome to a plentiful Table , kept her in her Sickness , paid her Doctor , and defray 'd the Charges of her Lying-in , the Nursing and Burial of her Child , which he was as kind to , as if it had been his own : That he for some Reasons ( which he did not think fit to mention in Court ) took her another Lodging at Hoxton ; she had a third Lodging in Wardrobe-Court in Carter-Lane , and a fourth at Mr. Falkenham 's in Thames-Street . So that in a little time she had cost him near a hundred Pounds . Yet , after all this , she ungratefully , and like a wicked jade as she was , had endeavoured to ruin him . He had lost Goods out of his Warehouse at several times , to the Amount of about 300 l. But little ! Ah very little did he think that Mrs. Adair , that Sylvia , that the Countess Spinello was the Thief ! He sometimes found Letters directed to her from Dublin , in which great Things were promised her by her Relations in Ireland . These he then thought she had carelesly mislaid , and they so established his good Opinion of her , that he lent her 91 l. She some time after gave him in part of Payment a Note of Hand for 42 l. from her supposed Brother Robert William Adair , which was endorsed with the Name of Robert Shelden , Sheriff of Worcoster . Upon this he wrote to Mr. Sheldon , who returned him no Answer ; but in about a Week he received a Letter dated from Salop , and signed as the Note , R.W.Adair . In this he had Thanks return 'd him , and Promises of Recompence made for the Care he had taken of Mrs. Penelope . It concluded with Advice to meet Mr. Sheldon , ( who would be in London in the following Week ) at Mr. Johnson 's a Woollen-Draper in Covent-Garden . He took his Sylvia with him , and went thither . Mr. Johnson received her with a great Shew of Respect , and spoke much in the Favour of her Brother , and said that he was sorry they did not come a day sooner , for Mr. Sheldon had been there , but was then gone back for Worcester . Being thus disappointed , he returned home with his Lady . But yet , he was far from entertaining even the least Suspicion of her Dishonesty , till one Day , to his great Astonishment , he was informed that she had sold some of his Goods to Mr. Camm . Upon which he apprehended her , and she own 'd , that beside what she had offered to Camm , she had sold several Parcels to Tho Baylis a Dealer in Irish Linnen , at the Two-Neck 'd Swan in Lad-Lane , and that he gave her but 15 d. a piece for the best Sort , which were worth a Crown . Mr. Camm depos 'd , that on the 6th of Nov. last , the Prisoner came to him in a Coach , and offered a Parcel of Silk Lacing to Sale . She said she had taken it for an old Debt that was owing her at Coventry , and that she was recommended to him by Mrs. King , a Porteress at an Inn in White - Chappel . He told her , he was willing to buy the Goods , if he could be satisfy 'd that they were her Property . She reply 'd , she would leave them with him till 10 of the Clock next Morning , and then he should either buy them or return them . She left them accordingly , and went into the Coach , but presently came out again , and told him she had bethought herself , and would take them with her . No , says he , as I have a mind to buy the Goods , I am willing to look them over first ; and since 't was your Proposal that I should keep them till to-morrow Morning , I shall not part with them before . She went away in a Huff , and he sent a Servant to Mr. King , who was not at home ; but her Husband told the Messenger , that he believed the Lady was one of his Sisters , neither true nor trusty . In the Evening Madam Adair came again , with Gilbert an Attorney , at Numb.5 . in Garden-Court , and demanded the Goods . Mrs. King was again sent for ; she came , and said , she admired the Gentlewoman should make use of her Name to Mr. Camm , when she never sent her , nor ever saw her but once , accidentally at a Friend 's House . This gave this Deponent a greater Suspicion of Miss Penny than he had before ; and therefore he positively refused to part with the Goods , till he had made farther Enquiry . The Countess and her Attorney , went away very angry , and left a great many Menaces behind them . Next day , this Deponent 's Servant found out Mr. Pritchard , who came and own 'd the Goods . Mr. Winnock deposed , that having heard that Pritchard had been robbed , and Baylis in Lad-Lane offering to sell him such Goods , he informed Pritchard of it , who came and found them to be his own . The Prisoner , in her Defence , did not deny that she had the Goods , but said that she bought them all of Pritchard , except some odd Parcels which he gave her . The Court bid her produce her Bills of Parcels and Receipts . She said she had none , for she commonly bought for time , and conditionally to pay the Money , or return the Goods if not sold ; and for that Reason , she always gave him a Note of Hand under his Bills , and whenever she paid him any part of her Money , he indors 'd it off . These Bills she called upon him to expose in Court . He told her , he would produce what Bills he had about him , and so took some Papers out of his Pocket , but they appeared to be but of little Signification as to the Point in hand , being only Accounts of the Expences she had put him to for Childbed-Linnen , a Midwife , Nurses , Chickens , Caudles , Possets , and divers other Necessaries . She farther said then , when she was gone from his House , she had often ordered a Porter to him for Goods in her Name , which he always sent , - if his Wife did not happen to be in the way . That he would afterwards have persuaded her to have confess 'd a Bond and Judgement to him for the Goods ; which she urged as an Argument , that she had bought them fairly : That he had often confess 'd that he was sorry he had troubled her , for she had never wrong 'd him , and he only did it to secure his Credit with Mr. Birch ; for if that was lost , he should be ruin 'd . She then called several Witnesses to prove these Assertions . Thompson the Porter deposed , that he often went for Mrs. Adair to Prichard for Goods , but had Orders not to let Prichard 's Wife see him , because she knew who he belong 'd to . That Prichard himself did several times deliver Parcels to him for her . And one time , it being rainy , Pritchard bid him take Care , and not let the Parcel be wet , for it was Silk Lacing . Another time , when he brought a Parcel from thence to Mrs. Adair , she opened it before him , and he saw it was Silk , and did believe it was the same Parcel as was then produced in Court , which Mr. Camm had before depos 'd , was offered to him by the Prisoner . An Attorney depos 'd , that in July last , Prichard came to him to draw a Warrant of Attorney , to confess a Bond and Judgment from the said Mrs. Adair to him ( Prichard ) for Money and Goods , and that Prichard told him , part of it was Cloaths which he bought for her in Henrietta-Street . Mary Wood deposed , that living at Mr. Falkenham 's in Thomas-Street , where the Prisoner lodged 16 Weeks , commencing the 1st of June last , Prichard often came to visit the Prisoner , and several times gave her Lace and Ribbon out of his Pocket . That one time in particular , he came at Nine in the Morning , and gave her six Pieces of Silk Lacing and Breed , and afterwards went with her to Vaux-Hall , & c. Another time he came and brought Coffee , staid and drank part of it with her , and then told her she must pay for it ; she gave him 2d . and he laugh 'd , and gave her a Parcel seal 'd up in a Paper-Bag ; which being open 'd , she ( this Evidence ) saw that it was Yellow Lacing . Mrs. Falkenham deposed , that when the Prisoner lodg 'd at her House , Prichard often came to see her , and always gave her a good Word . Eleanor Ray deposed , that she was the Prisoner 's Nurse , and several times when she went to see her at Mrs. Falkenham 's , she found the Prosecutor there , and saw him give her Silk ; and often heard him bid her make free with him when-ever she wanted Money , for he was her dear Bosom-Friend : That she attended upon the Prisoner when in the Compter , and Prichard constantly visited her every Day : That he cry 'd to her , and said , That he could not swear she had ever robb 'd him ; only he beg 'd of her to own that she had , because otherwise he should be ruin 'd , for his Goods were gone , and he could not make up his Accompts with Mr. Birch ; And if she would serve him so far , he would afterwards make her whatever Amends she would require . The Turnkey of Woodstreet Compter deposed , that when the Prisoner was brought in there , Prichard was with her , and said , He could not swear against her for the World : That Prichard agreed with him for the Prisoner 's Lodging for the first 5 Nights , at the rate of Half a Guinea Fee , 2s . for the first Night ; and 1 s. each for the 4 next . Moses Levi deposed , that Prichard told him at the Mitre Tavern , that he would never have sworn against her , had he not been oblig 'd to it : That Prichard seeing the Prisoner next Morning , he ran to her and said , O my Dear , how do you do ? I neither can nor would swear against you for the World . Mr. Dugdale deposed , that being at the Tavern with Prichard , after Mrs. Adair was in Custody , Prichard told him , He could never swear against her . What do ye mean , ( says this Witness ) have you not swore against her already ? Is she not committed upon your Oath ? No , ( says Prichard ) I neither have , nor will , nor can swear against her ; - it was an Imposition of the Justice 's Clerk ; and I 'll see if the Bill ca n't be brought in Ignoramus . Prichard then called some Witnesses to invalidate the Evidence of her Porter Thompson , who plies in S. Paul 's Church-yard . Smith deposed , that but last Night he heard Thompson say , that he thought the Prisoner was as great a Thief , a Bite , and a Cheat , as any England ; and he was afraid she 'd never have the Punishment she deserved . Several others gave Thompson but a scurvy Character . The Jury considering the Whole , acquitted the Prisoner . Joseph Clutterbuck , of S. Michael Crooked-Lane , was indicted for feloniously stealing 40lb . of Tallow , value 30s . the Goods of Robert Hutchinson , on the 30th of October last ; but the Evidence not being sufficient , the Jury acquitted him . Sarah Joyner , alias Cecily Knight , was indicted for privately stealing in the Shop of John Wagstaff and John Fellows , 2 lb . of Sewing Silk , the Goods of the said Wagstaff and Fellows , on the 13th of November last ; but the Fact not being clearly proved , she was acquitted . John Landis , of S. Andrew Undershaft , was indicted for feloniously stealing 13 Canes , value 16 s. the Goods of Ralph Martland , on the 29th of Oct. last . It appeared that as Jos Brown , Servant to the Prosecutor , was going along Cornhill , the Prisoner met him and cheapen 'd one , and going to the Cross-Keys Tavern Door , he took the Bundle from the Boy , under Pretence of going to the Candle at the Bar to choose one out ; and bid him wait in the Entry , that his Aunt ( who he said kept the Bar ) might not see him ( the Boy ) ; for ( continues the Prisoner ) I have a Kinsman that sells Canes , and my Aunt would be angry if she knew that I bought one of any body else . The Boy waited a quarter of an Hour , and wondering why his Chapman was so long in choosing 2 Cane , went to the Bar-Keeper , and enquir 'd for her Nephew . The Gentlewoman said she had no Nephew : But when he mention 'd the Canes , the Drawers inform 'd him , that the Tavern was a Thorowfare , and remember 'd that a little while ago they saw a Man go through with a Bundle of Canes . The Prisoner afterwards selling the Canes to Mr. Powel in the Borough , he was discover 'd and apprehended , But it appearing to be no Felony , but a Cheat , the Court directed the Jury to acquit him of this Indictment , and order 'd the Prosecutor to prefer another Bill against him for a Misdemeanor , in unlawfully and fraudulently taking away the said Canes . This was done accordingly , and the Jury found him guilty . Fined and Imprisoned . Mary Hilliard , of S. James Clerkenwell , was indicted for feloniously stealing in the House of Tho . Nash three Gold Rings , value 40 s. two Silk Aprons value 8 s. a Pair of Stockings value 3 s. and 4 s. in Money , the Goods and Money of Tho Nash ; and a Mob and Apron , and other things , the Goods of Mary Howell , on the 10th of Sep. last . It appeared that on Tuesday the Prisoner came as a Servant to Mr. Nash , a Victualler in Peter-street . Clerkenwell , and on the Thursday following went away with the Goods . The Prosecutor offer 'd half a Guinea Reward for apprehending her ; upon which a Men that lay with her the preceding Night came and carry 'd him to her Lodging , where they took her a-bed . Her Confession was read in Court , and the Jury found her guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d. Transportation . Susan Stevens , of S. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a Stuff Gown value 4 s. the Goods of William Sallis , on the 20th of Aug . last . But the Evidence being too weak , she was acquitted . Ann Allington , alias Aldrington , of S. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a Hoop-Petticoat , value 3 s. 6 d . the Goods of Tho . Farmer on the 10th of Nov. last .

She was a second time indicted of Norton-Folgate , for feloniously stealing in the House of T. Smith , three Coats value 12 s. a Hat , Gown , and other Things , the Goods of several Persons , on the 30th of October last . It appeared that Smith lett a Garret to the Prisoner and her Mother , from whence several Things in the second Indictment were lost . The Prisoner and her Mother being charged with them , forsook their Lodging at Smith 's House , and took another : Upon which Smith procured Prig the Constable to apprehend them . Prig brought the Prisoner to his House , where she confess 'd the Fact ; and at the same time stole from thence a Silver Mug , carried it to the Watch-house , and hid it under the Coats ; but it being mist , and she suspected , she was accused with it , and confess 'd .

It appeared that the Goods were taken out of the Prosecutor 's Box which she had left in her Room unlock 'd . The Prisoners were taken up the same Night , and sent to the Round-house upon Suspicion of another Robbery ; which the Prosecutor hearing , went thither , and found them awkwardly rigg 'd in her Cloaths . Roberts in her Defence said , that Alexander put her into the Room , and fill 'd her Apron with the Cloaths : But Alexander deny 'd it , and said she met Roberts in Short's-Gardens with the Cloaths in her Apron , and they went together to a Gin-Shop in Vinegar-Yard , where she drest Roberts in some of the Cloaths , and left the rest in Pawn for the Reckoning . The Jury found Roberts guilty to the Value of 10 d. Transportation . And acquitted Alexander .

Peg answer 'd , Tis I. I ! Who are you , and what do you want ? - Why , my Mistress sent me to see if the Candle was safe . - Your Mistress ! Who is your Mistress ? - Go look , says Peg ; and snatching a Suit of Head-Cloaths off the Table , ran down Stairs . She ( this Evidence ) then jumpt out of Bed quite naked , and so ran down after her into the Street , and call 'd the Watch . The Prisoners got off for the present , but were taken up on Suspicion the same Night , and put into the Round-house , where Roberts confesed , that Alexander put her down the Cellar-Window . But when she came to make her Defence at the Bar , she said that Ellison was a common whore , and gave her the Gown to live with her , and follow the same Trade , in Coleston's-court ( and not Holesford 's Alley ) in Drury Lane : But she refusing to comply , the other prosecuted her . The Jury acquitted them .

Eliz Thomson depos 'd , that she was walking with the Prosecutor , and had hold of her Arm , when she was robb 'd : That as the Prisoner was taking the Wall of them , she turn 'd about , and look 'd at him , the Lamp then shining full in his Face , and therefore she was positive that the Prisoner was the very Man that snatch 'd the Prosecutor 's Pocket .

The Watch quickly came to their Assistance , and secur 'd him . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that as he was going to Execution-Dock , a Man clapt him on the Shoulder , and he being under fear of an Arrest , thought it had been a Bailiff , and so took to his Heels , which was the only Reason of his running up Burr Street .

Robert Mow deposed , that the Prosecutor was Servant to - Hawes Esq ; in Channel-Row , Westminster ; that having a Holiday given her , and being a Stranger in London , she came to him to desire him to go with her into the City to find out a Person that ow 'd her some Money : They went , she received the Money ; he brought her back to his House , where she staid till about Eight that Night , and he went with her as far as Katharine-Street in Covent-Garden . Marg . Dixon deposed , that soon after she had parted with Mr. Mow , she enquired the Way of two Men ; and one of them , who was the Prisoner , told her he lived not far from thence , and would go home with her : He carry 'd her out of her Way , and pulled her into a Tavern in a strange Place ; she cry 'd , and beg 'd of him to to put her in the right Way ; he promised her he would , and call 'd a Coach , which drove to an Inn , and by the Way he pull 'd her Rings off her Finger , and took away her Handkerchief and Fan . She was frighted , and knew not what to do ; but when she came to the Inn , she desired him to give her back what he had taken from her : He swore that he would not , except she would pay for the Wine and the Coach . She consented , rather than lose her Things ; and knowing that she had three Guineas before she met him , she put her Hand into her Bosom to take one out , but found that they were all gone . She cry 'd out that the Rogue had got her Money too ; upon which he endeavour 'd to get off , but was prevented , and she fell into a Swoon . The Tapster and the Maid , at the Bear-Inn in Piccadilly , confirm 'd the latter Part of the Prosecutor 's Evidence ; adding , that when she said the Rogue had robb 'd her of all , he cry 'd , Damn the Bitch , I 'll have no more to say to her , and was going away ; but the Maid catch 'd him by the Hair and stopt him . This was corroborated by the Constable , who farther deposed , that he conducted the Prisoner to the Round-House ; and thence next Morning before the Justice , where he deliver 'd the Rings to him , ( the Constable ) and the Constable produced them in Court . - Hawes Esq ; gave a very good Character of his Maid the Prosecutor , by assuring the Court that he believed her to be a good natur 'd , innocent , modest , honest , Country Girl , and entirely unacquainted with the Town . The Prisoner in his Defence said that as he was talking with his Friend in Russel-street , the Prosecutor came by very drunk , and desired him to shew her the Way to Channel-Row ; he having Business that Way , was glad of her Company ; they went across the Park , where he having Occasion to make Water , went aside , and in the mean while a Man came up and took her round the Waste : She was frighted ; but he stepping up to the Man , ask 'd him what he meant by it ? Sir , says the Man , I ask your Pardon , I did not know the Lady belong 'd to you ; and so saying , he retired . Soon after , she dropt her Handkerchief and Fan , he took them up , and she pray 'd him to carry 'em for her . They then came to the Sun Tavern in King-Street , Westminster ; where she told him she would treat him for his Trouble in coming so far with her . They drank two Pints , and she was so drunk , that she fell out of her Chair , and her Rings dropt off her Finger : He took both her and them up again , and she desir 'd him to take care of them till they parted . She said it was too late for her to go home that Night , and therefore beg 'd of him to provide a Lodging for her . They then went to a Brandy-Shop by the Gatehouse , from whence they took Coach to the Bear-Inn in Piccadilly , where he spoke for a Bed ; but she being willing to drink first , they sat down together , and in a little time the began to cry about her Rings , which he did not refuse to give her , if she would pay for the Wine and the Coach ; but she falling into Fits , the Constable was called , came , and carry 'd him to the Round-House . Robert Ship deposed , that he was the Person that stood talking with the Prisoner when the Prosecutor came to them ; that she was very drunk , and ask 'd one of them to shew her the Way home . Robert Mow then deposed again , that the Prosecutor was sober when he left her ; and the Tapster , Maid , and Constable , at the Bear-Inn , farther deposed , that the Prosecutor was in Fitts , but not drunk , when she was at that House . but yet two or three Gentlemen appear 'd to the Prisoner 's Reputation , he having been Servant to some of their Acquaintance : One more in particular said , having once by Mistake given him a Guinea in changing Half a Crown , he very honestly brought it him again the next Morning . The Jury acquitted him . Thomas Herbert , of S. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted , for that he , in Company with Tho Hemmer , Tho Rowden and Rich Mason , did break and enter the House of Stephen Watts , and feloniously take from thence 16 pair of Breeches , Value 36 s. the Goods of Stephen Watts , on the 6th of Nov . about the Hour of 12 at Night . Stephen Watts depos 'd , that he keeps a Sale-Shop at the Cross-Keys in Monmouth-street , and between 11 and 12 at Night he made fast his Door and Windows , and went to Bed ; but about 3 he was called up again by the Watch , and found that the Shop had been broke open and robb 'd . Tho Flemm deposed , that himself , the Prisoner , Tho . Rowdon and Richard Mason , met at the Prisoner 's House about 7 at Night , and agreed to try their Fortune in Monmonth-street . About Midnight they all went out together , and passing by the Prosecutor 's Shop , Mason struck the Bar of the Windows with his Hand , and said it would be no great Difficulty for them to get in there . He then forced off the Staple . The Prisoner ript off the Hinges of the Outer-Shutters , and wrenched off the Runner of those within , and pushing one of them back , took out the Goods , and so they all returned to the Prisoner 's House , where they spent the remaining part of the Night . Next day they put the Breeches into a Sack , went all together , and carried them by turns , till they had dispos 'd of them . Two Pair this Evidence pawn 'd to Norwood in Hart-street , Covent-Garden for 4s . Five Pair the Prisoner sold to Jos Collins , and 4 Pair to Sarah Shad , both in Rag-Fair . Collins depos 'd that the Prisoner brought the Breeches to him , and told him that he was a Taylor , and made them himself , but the other he had bought . He observed the Prisoner go a-cross the Way to two of his Companions , who waited for him with a Bundle in a Sack . This made him suspect that they were stol'n , and therefore he stept out after these 3 Men ; but they being aware of him , made off . He then had the Breeches cry 'd ; by which he found that they belong 'd to Mr. Watts . John Shorey depos 'd , that having heard of Watts 's being robbed ; and going along Hart-street , he saw Flemmer , whom he knew to be a Rogue , go into Norwood 's with 2 Pair of Breeches , while the Prisoner and Mason waited with a Sack on the other side of the Way . All which gave him ground to think that these were the Men that had robb 'd Mr. Watts ; and therefore he stood still to take Notice of them , which the Prisoner suspecting , said to Mason - D - that Chuckle-beaded Son of a Bitch . What does he stand watching us for ? - Go over and take him a Knock . As Mason was coming towards him , Flemmer came out of the House without the Breeches , and so they went away together . This Evidence then went and gave Norwood a Hint , and desired him to stop them when they came again And Flemmer happening to come the same Evening , Norwood apprehended him . He impeached the others , and made himself an Evidence . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that the others indeed were at his House the Evening before the Robbery , and they would have had him gone with them ; but he refused , went to Bed , and left them below with his Wife . About 3 in the Morning they came again , and called , but he made no Answer .

Paul 's Shadwell , to the great Terror of his Majesty 's Subjects , against the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , his Crown and Dignity , and against the Form of the Statute in this Case made and provided . The Council for the King open 'd , that the Prisoners were Inhabitants of the New Mint , and so Notorious in the Riots committed there , and in Places adjacent , that they were distinguished by the Titles of Captain Towers and General Webb . That a Book was kept and Place called the Seven Cities of Refuge , in which the Names of all the New Minters were enter 'd , they paying half a Guinea at the time of subscribing , and obliging them selves to the utmost extent of their Power to rescue and set at Liberty any Person on the said List , whenever he was arrested or imprison 'd . That accordingly the Prisoners and seven others did at the Time , after the Manner , and in the Place mention 'd in the Indictment , appear ; and by Force of Arms take a Person Arrested out of the House of John Errington . The Prisoners desired , that when any Witness was giving Evidence , the rest might be put out of Court ; which the Court granted .

The next Morning , being Sunday , about 11 o'Clock , the Street-Door being left a-jar , a Man rush 'd in with a great Stick in his Hand like a Quarter-Staff , his Face and Breast all black , as if besmear 'd with a Mixture of Soot and Grease ; his Hair shot off no Hat no Wig , no Shirt nor any thing on his back but a blue Pee Jacket flying open before D - ye , say he , you have put one of our Prisoners , and we 'll have him away , for we are sworn to one another - Who 's that ? Charles ? ( says Errington ; for he was so disguised , that he did not Know him till he spoke , tho ' he had often seen him before . ) Yet D - , ( says Towers ) and then Webb and several others follow him in , with Broomsticks in their Hands , but not disguised . Errington told 'em he had but one prisoner , and he belong 'd to Tower-Hill . 'T is no matter for that , ( says Tower , and Pull 'd out a paper ) we have his Name bere and he 's enter 'd in our List . 'T is really so Mr. Errington ( says Webb in a milder Tone ) and therefore we desire you 'd restore him to us , and we 'll go away Quietly . Errington knew 'twould not only be in vain , but dangerous , to deny 'em , and so deliver 'd his Prisoner up . They went out in Triumph , with repeated Huzza 's ; but Towers turning back , and seeing Daniel Taylor , a Waterman , lifted up his Quarter Staff , and said , I must have one Knock or two at that setting Son of a Bitch . But Errington catching hold of his Arm , persuaded him to take another Opportunity for it , and so he went out again .

In about half an Hour after , as he was leaning over his Hatch , he saw them all returning in the same Manner as they went , bringing West along with them ; and as they were passing this Evidence 's Door , Capt . Towers ( whom he knew by his Tongue ) stept up towards him with his Quarter-Staff , and said , I must have one Knock at his Napper : But the other clapping the Door to , prevented him , and then the Mob went off . Towers in his Defence said , that he was not disguised , and that his Face was only dirty , and not designedly made black : That having formerly unfortunately been bound for others , to the Amount of 400 l. he was forced to fly to the Old Mint ; and when that broke up , and he could not be discharged by the Act , he took Shelter in the New Mint ; and thought that he had better reside there , and live honestly , than go upon the Highway for Money to pay his Debts ; and that he was never guilty of Rioting , any farther than defending himself when he was pursued by Bailiffs . That supposing he had been disguised at that time , yet as ( he persuaded himself ) there had been no sufficient Proof of his having committed any Violence , he thought the Masqueraders were as liable to be convicted by the same Act as himself . Webb in his Defence said , that he did not appear in any Disguise ; and indeed there being no Evidence to prove it upon him , the Jury acquitted him , and found Towers guilty . Death . John Tims was indicted , and Charles Towers a 2d time indicted , for that they , with John Bowler , John Tibbs , and John Fencott , ( not yet taken ) did on the 15th of August last unlawfully and riotously , the Dwelling House of Henry Brookshank , begin to destroy .

Never fear me , ( says Pearson ) what is it ? - Could you dispose of a Coat or Pair of Breeches cleverly ? - Ay , or any thing else that you can bring me . - Indeed ! Why , I 'll tell thee then - My Master 's Shop is very well stock 'd - and - you understand me . - Yes , yes , you mean that he can not easily miss an odd thing . - Right . I know it to be so , for Rowland Swanson and I have try 'd it several times . - Have ye , faith ! Why then here 's my Hand , I 'll make the third Person ; appoint the Time . - Let me see ! - to morrow Night about this time ; - My Master will be gone to Bed , and I 'll wait for you at the Door . - They agreed , and parted ; and Pearson the next day informs the Prosecutor of all that had past between'em . He desired Pearson entirely to fall in with the Prisoners Measures , and to carry whatever Goods they stole to Mr. Long 's the Pawnbroker , to whom he would discover the Secret , and desires him to lend Money upon'em .
