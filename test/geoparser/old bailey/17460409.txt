Q . ( to Thomas Thornhill ) What do you know of this Matter ? Thornhill . The House where this Thing happen 'd I had lodg 'd at ; there was a poor Woman in the House that wash 'd my Linnen ; as I was going to her thro ' the House , I saw five or six Soldiers playing at Cards in the Box . Q . What House is it ? Thornhill . A Publick House , in King-Street , Westminster ; I set down with the Landlady 's Sister in a Box , about half an Hour , upon which I heard some Words arise between two Soldiers , and the Deceas 'd swore that he had won the Game ; the other ( the Prisoner at the Bar ) swore that he had not won it fair , and insisted upon its being play 'd over-again , the other swore he would not ; upon that he came out of the Box , the Prisoner at the Bar insisted that he would not pay , the other Man ( the Deceas 'd ) came out to him , and swore he should pay it ; with that they had a great many Words , at last the Deceas 'd was in a great Passion , stripp 'd into his Shirt , swore he would fight him if he did not pay it . Said the Prisoner , I will have a Knock with you over the Table ; the Prisoner did not seem to be willing to go into the House to fight ; so after a great many Words , at last they put their Clothes on again , for the People of the House said there should be no Fighting in the House ; with that Words arose again , and the Deceas 'd swore he would have the Pint of Beer , and call 'd for it ; the Prisoner at the Bar said he would not pay for it ; with that the Deceas 'd stripp 'd his Clothes off again , and struck the Prisoner at the Bar , and swore he would have the Beer , and in a vast Passion , very forward to fight , he call 'd this Man a great many Names because he would not pay , and struck him once or twice , and the Prisoner did not return it , and did not seem to be free to fight with him ; but after a great many Words , and many Provocations , the Deceas 'd struck him again ; at last the Prisoner at the Bar said , I ca n't fight against four or five of you , or else I should not be afraid to take a Knock or two with you ; so the Corporal said , do n't make such a Noise here , but if you have a mind to fight , go out , and no Man shall stir out here . The Corporal said to the Prisoner , I will give you five Shillings if any Man comes out to give you any soul Play . After many Provocations the Prisoner at the Bar said I 'll go out and take a Knock or two with you , if I have fair Play ; so they went out at the Back-Door and went up to Downing's-Court there to fight ; I not being concern 'd about it , but hearing all that pass 'd I had the Curiosity to go out at the Street Door to see how the Battle would go ; I might be about 30 Yards behind them : I saw the Prisoner at the Bar throw his Coat and Waistcoat off ; they were just set to it , they made two or three Blows at one another ; presently the Prisoner gave the other a Trip and he tumbled down ; tumbling down he did not offer to get up again ; so he not offering to get up , the Prisoner at the Bar said , if you will have any more of it get up ; with that he gave him a little Pull by the Hand , and it seem 'd as if the Man was afraid to get up again ; but I saw he began to work at the stomach , and began to heave and froth at the Mouth ; and I believe died in ten Minutes . Q . How far off was you from them ? Thornhill . Please you , my Lord , I was as near as the Door . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Will you ask the Witness any Questions ? Prisoner . No , my Lord . Q . ( to Joseph Terry . ) What do you know of this Matter ? Terry . I keep a Publick-House just facing this House ; I was coming out to make Water ? I saw the Prisoner at the Bar and the Deceas 'd , they were both stripp 'd . Q . Then you was not in the House ? Terry . No , my Lord ; but when I came up to them I believe there was four or five Blows between them both ; I believe a Boy of twelve or fourteen Years of Age could have given a greater Blow than either of them : The Deceas 'd fell backward ; when he was down the Prisoner at the Bar put his Hand to his Breast , and said , take a good Heart and get up again . Coming back I saw the Landlady of the House at the Back Door , who said to me , Did you see it ? Yes , I said , I believ 'd it was all over . The Girl came back presently after me and said , the Man is dead , and he was brought down . Court . You saw him dead . Terry . I saw him dead ; that is all I know of the Matter . Q . ( to William Buchanan . ) What do you know of Prisoner ? What Office do you bear ? Buchanan . I am a Serjeant : I have known the Prisoner many Years ; he always behav 'd well as a Soldier ; I never knew him brought into any Scrapes ? he receiv 'd a Wound in Flanders , was taken a Prisoner to France , and was there five Months .

I took him before the Justice , and he own 'd the taking of the Spoons ; he said , that it was thro ' great Necessity that he did it , and that he never did any such Thing before . The Prisoner was a Foreigner , and spoke by an Interpreter . Interpreter . My Lord , he says he only borrow 'd the Spoons . Court . Ask him if he will ask the Prosecutor any Questions . Interpreter . He has no Questions to ask . John Brown . The Prisoner came to my House the 12th of February , and brought this Spoon I have in my Hand . I saw something fil 'd on the back Side of the Spoon , which made me have some Suspicion , or I should not , for I have known the Man for three or four Years . He said that it was his own . I advertis 'd the Spoon , and several People came , but none came up to the Marks of it : After that I saw an Advertisement of Mr. Woodifield 's . I went to Mr. Woodifield 's with the two Spoons , and Mr. Woodifield compar 'd them with some other Spoons , and we match 'd the Silversmith 's Mark ; we compar 'd them with some other Spoons of theirs , and found that they tallied exactly . I describ 'd the Person I had them of ; they said he came to their House very often . The same Day he came again ; upon that they stopp 'd him , and he own 'd he took the Spoon , and said it was pure Necessary put him upon it . When he went before the Justice , he own 'd the same , and seem 'd very ignorant of the Nature of the Crime . Court . That 's the Spoon you are sure you had from this Man ? Brown . Yes . Court . Now , tell him , is his Time to make his Defence , and call any Witnesses if he can . Interpreter . My Lord , he says the Gentleman that keeps the Tavern in Pall-Mall would speak for him , and that several would have appear 'd for him , if they had known of his Trial coming on . The Prosecutor gave the Man a very good Character , and believ 'd it was mere Necessity , that he had a sick Wife , & c. and he offer 'd to take him into his House himself . Guilty . [ Branding .

( to Leigh ) What have you to say about the Prisoner 's stealing some Thread ? Leigh . I have to alledge against him stealing that Thread , and a Piece of Cloth , which I miss 'd , and found mislaid in an improper Place . Q . What Business are you ? Leigh . A Manchester Warehouse-keeper and Linnen-draper . Q . What was it you missed ? Leigh . A Piece of Irish Cloth . Upon missing that Cloth I examin 'd all my Servants ; upon the Evening of that Day I discovered this Man had laid it out of its Place ; and in the Evening of that Day John Hurst had endeavoured to throw it upon several of my Servants , in order to excuse himself . In examining him about the Piece of Cloth that he had carried out , I ask 'd him how he came by that Cloth ; he said he had bought it of an Irish Merchant 's Servant about a Month before , and he had it away about a Week before , and I asked him whether he could produce the Piece of Cloth ; he said he could . After he produced the Cloth , I asked him how it came to have my Mark upon it ; then he said it was a Piece of Cloth that he bought of me a Twelve-month ago . Q . So he produced it , did he ? Leigh . No , My Lord , we had it by another Discovery ; we found Part of it in the House of one Mrs. Morris , and Part of it in the House of one Mrs. Winter . Q . ( by the Council for the Prisoner ) to Leigh . This Man has lived with you for sometime , has he not ? Leigh . Yes . Council . Then you can account for some Money that he has : Do n't you know that he has an Annuity besides ? Did you find that in his Box ? Had he never any Cloth you for which he paid ? Leigh . Yes . Council . And I suppose he might have had more . Leigh . He might have had any Quantity , because we never restrain any Body . Council . Can you say you do n't believe he would have paid you for it ? Did he say that he had stole it ? that he had taken it out of the House , contrary to his Duty , and what he ought not to do ? Did he confess before the Justice that he had stole it ? Leigh . Yes , he did confess , Sir ; he would not confess any Thing else but this . I found the Pound of Thread , and I found Part of the Cloth in his Box . I found this in Mrs. Morris 's House [ The Piece of Cloth produced in Court ] We ask 'd him if he had taken it out of the House in an unlawful Manner . Q . Are you sure it was your 's ? Leigh . Yes , I can swear 't is my Cloth . Q . ( to Morris . ) What do you know of this Matter ? Morris . The 20th of March was the first Time I ever saw this Man ; he said he had lived two Years with this Gentleman , and he owned him two Years Wages , and that his Master had charged him with robbing him , and had taken twenty-three Pounds out of his Box and Pocket , and he left this Cloth in my House . I asked this young Man how he came to bring this Cloth from his Master 's ; he asked me if I could recommend him to a Lawyer : On Monday his Master came with a Search Warrant , and found the Cloth there . Q . ( to Hester Winter ) What do you know of this Affair ? Winter . Sir , What I know of this Man is , the Prisoner brought some Cloth to make a Shirt . Q . How much Cloth did he bring to you ? Winter . A Shirt ready cut out , how much I can not say . Q . How much Cloth did he bring to you ? Was there only Cloth enough for one Shirt ? Winter . Yes . Q . And did you make it into a Shirt ? Winter . I had begun it , but this other Gentleman carried it away , that which was produced in Court was brought to me . Q . ( to Leigh . ) That was your Cloth ? Leigh . Yes , my Lord , it was . James Goodyer . What do you know of this Affair ? Goodyer . All that I have to say , I went with my Master with a Search-Warrant , and found one Part of the Cloth at Mrs. Morris 's , and the other at Mrs. Winter 's . The Prisoner 's Aunt said , that he had brought three or four Shirts , but carried them off again . Q . Where did you find this Shirt ? Goodyer . We found it , my Lord , upon the Bed . Q . Did you hear the Prisoner say how he came by this Cloth after he carry 'd it to Mrs. Morris 's and Mrs. Winter 's ? Do you know that to be your Master 's Cloth ? Goodyer . Yes , I believe this is my Master 's Cloth . Q . ( to William Williams . ) How long have you known the Prisoner at the Bar ? Williams . About five Years ; he has a very honest Character , to the best of my Knowledge ; he work 'd under my Direction for two Years ; is a very honest industrious Man ; I never heard him charg 'd with any thing . Q . ( to Thomas Holt . ) How long have you known the Prisoner at the Bar ? Holt . Between four and five Years . Q . Do you know what Business he has been in all that time ? Holt . I have known him to be in the Lead Business . Q . How did he behave ? Holt . I never heard but he behav 'd always well . Q . What Wages had he in the Lead Business ? Holt . I paid him 10 s. a Week . The Council for the Prisoner urg 'd that it was no more than a Breach of Trust , as he was a Servant in the Shop . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 163. Elizabeth Hensworth was indicted for stealing one Cotton Gown , value 2 s. four Linnen Caps value 2 s. and two Silver Tea Spoons value 1 s. the Goods of John Russel . Q .

A strip 'd Cotton Gown , one Clock , a Woman 's Cap , a Child 's Cap , a Shirt , & c. Q . Were they stolen ? Russel . Yes . Q . Do you know who stole them ? Russel . It appears to me to be Elizabeth Hensworth , the Girl in the House ; she was to be such , and officiated as such : She got up that Morning with an Intent to go to Washing , as she told her Mistress , about Five o'Clock ; about Six o'Clock , I was surpriz 'd by the knocking and thundering at my Door ; there was a Boy come to my Shop for Goods : At that Hour in the Morning we found the Door standing a-jar . I came down , and a Person I saw in the Street said I had left my Door open ; whe n I came down there was no Fire , nor no Appearance of Washing . Q . Did you find the Girl in the House . Russel . No . I went up and told my Wife ; she ask 'd me if I saw any Thing missing ; I miss 'd several Things . Then I consulted what I should do , as the Girl could not be found ; I went to a Broker 's and discover 'd some of the Things . Q . What did you discover ? Russel . I discover 'd two Caps and a Shirt . I went about to a great many Places , and heard no more of them 'till Ten o'Clock ; a Broker came to me , and he stopp 'd the Girl by offering a Cap of my Wife 's . When I came to the Pawnbroker 's I saw it was the Girl that was with me : She had a Woman with her , and another in the Street . Court . Pray give an Account of the Things that you have a Witness here to prove , the Things that were found upon the Girl . Russel . The two Caps were left with Mrs Turner ; The Cotton Gown , and several other Things , were pledg 'd with Mr. Tayler . Q . ( to Mary Turner ) Do you know any Thing of such Goods as have been mention 'd ? Turner . On the 13th Day of March the Prisoner brought a Child 's Cap ; she said it was her Sister 's ; I look 'd down Stairs to see how she was dress 'd . Court . Prisoner , do you hear what Mrs. Turner says ; and Russel says he lost some Linnen out of his House , and she says you brought some of those Things to her to pawn . Prisoner . Sir , I did not give them to her herself . Q. Mrs. Turner , are you sure the Prisoner was the Person that brought these Things to you ? Turner . I just had a Glimpse of her ; I believe 't is ; but my Maid says she should not know her if she should see her . Robert Tayler . The 13th of March last the Person was brought to me , ( the Prisoner at the Bar ) but there is a vast Alteration ; for she was then dress 'd vastly clean . She brought to my Shop one Gown , an Apron , and a Piece of Stuff-Damask , and there was another Woman with her . She wanted 12 s. for it , I told her I could not lend her so much upon it ; then when she came again I ask 'd her whether they were her own , and she said they were her Sister 's . Q . Who made you that Answer ? Tayler . I think the Prisoner at the Bar : I am sure she is the Person . Q . Where are them Things ; are they here ? Tayler . Yes , my Lord . [ The Things were produced in Court ] Q . ( to the Prosecutor ) Where had you these Things ? Prosecutor . At the Justice 's House . Q . ( to the Pawnbroker ) Were these the Things that were produced at the Justice 's House ; were these the Things that were in Pawn ? Tayler . Yes , my Lord . Q . ( to Russel ) Were these the Things that were stole out of your House ? Russel . Yes , my Lord . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Have you any Witnesses to call ? Prisoner . No , Sir . Acquitted . 164 , 165.

Smith . There is an old Woman in the Neighbourhood I look after ; I go about two Hours every Evening ; while I was with her they got into my Room ; I had the Key in my Pocket ; whether I mislock 'd it I can not tell . When I came home I found my Box broke open ; a Gown and a Shift were in the Box I found unlock 'd . Q . How did they contrive to open your Box ? Smith . That I can not be Judge of ; I had the Key of my Door in my Pocket , and the Keys of the Box likewise ; but when I came home I found both open . Q . How long was you out ? Smith . I was out from half an Hour after Six to Eight , as I am every Night , with the Gentlewoman I look after . Jane Hibard . I bought the Coat of the biggest of the Prisoners , Anne Smith . Q .

At one Perry 's in Shepherd-Street ; the Prisoner own 'd that she had pawn 'd the Things there . Q . Is that all you heard the Prisoner say ? Did she own the Things ? Parran . Yes , she own 'd the Things were stole from me , and several more that were not pawn 'd there : I had a Warrant from Justice De Veil to search the House of the Pawnbroker . Both Perry and his Mother offer 'd to swear that she had several of the Things away that we afterwards found there . Q . ( to John Perry . ) Are you a Pawnbroker ? Perry . Yes , my Lord . The Prisoner at the Bar brought Goods to me backward and forward ; he has often employ 'd the Prisoner at the Bar to bring Things backward and forward to our House . Q . ( to the Prosecutor . ) What Business are you ? Parran . I am at present out of Business ; I kept the Black Bear in Piccadilly . Q . ( to Perry . ) How came you to receive these Goods ? Perry .

Did not the Pawnbroker deny the Things at first ? Marshall . He said he did not know he had any such Things ; but I said I must search ; so I went to searching , and he brought some Things and deny 'd some others , particularly the Dozen of Plates . Q . ( to Perry . ) How came you to deny these Things ? Perry . Because she had fetch 'd them three or four Days or a Week before , and we did not think they had been brought again ; they had not been there above two or three Days by the Marks . Court . Prisoner , now is your time to make your Defence . Have you any thing to say ? Have you any Witnesses to call ? Margaret Foot . This was the first Fact she ever committed ; she always behav 'd very well , no body could come against her for any thing in this World 'till now . She is my own Child . Guilty 39 s.

WillIAM Askew was indicted for stealing a large Silver Tankard , Value 10 l. a Pint Silver Mug , Value 4 l. twelve Silver Tea Spoons , Value 12 s. a Silver Strainer , Value 1 s. 6 d. a Silver Pepper-Box , Value 18 s. and a Pewter Milk-Pot , Value 9 d. the Goods of Charles Appelby the Elder , on the 22d of March . Council for the Prosecutor . Please your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury , I am Council in the Cause against the Prisoner at the Bar , William Askew , who is charg 'd with Felony committed in the House of Charles Appeiby , to whom he was a Journeyman . Gentlemen , the Facts we have to lay before you are all Circumstances , and seem to be such as we can not err in , when they are laid all together . There is nothing of a positive Proof , neither was he taken in Means , as the Law calls it , in having any Goods found upon him ; but as 't is on Circumstances the Affair entirely depends , I shall submit it to the Court , whether they are so satisfactory as to convince you that this is the Man who robb 'd his Master . As the Case is represented to me , by Mr. Appleby , Brasier , in Harp-Alley , the Prisoner 's Bed , Gentlemen , was placed in the Shop , pretty near a little Room by the Parlour ; it lies so near the Doors that 't is impossible for any one to make the least Noise without waking the Person who lies in that Bed . On Friday Night , the 21st of March , young Mr. Appelby coming home very late , between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock , he look 'd about , as he commonly does , to see if all Things were safe , and at that Time they were so . His Father and Mother lay up one Pair of Stairs and his Sisters up three ; young Mr. Appelby 's Room was up two Pair of Stairs , and only this Servant on the Ground Floor , who was suppos 'd to be in Bed close by the Parlour . Some time after Twelve the Watchmen beat their respective Rounds , when the Door was safe , and continued so 'till a little after Four , at which Time the Watchman discover 'd it open and went into the Shop , who , seeing the Prisoner at the Bar , ask 'd him the Meaning of it ; oh , says he , nothing at all , a small Matter , I suppose some of the Family are gone out ; though , as the Door had been open 'd , it could not be done without his Privity ; but he shuts the Door again and takes no other Notice of of it . When the Porter came in the Morning , as usual , to open the Shop , he went into the Parlour and discover 'd the Escrutore had been forced open : Afterwards , upon searching the Prisoner 's Box , an old Nailpiercer , newly fil 'd up , was found , which appear 'd to be a very proper Instrument for forcing those Locks and Holts . If any Stranger , Gentlemen , had done this , 't is extreamly odd that the Servant , intrusted in the Family , should take no Notice of it , not alarm them . There is another Circumstance , viz . a cross , crabbed Dog , as surly perhaps as any in Town , which this Brazier keeps for the Safety of his Shop , and will hardly suffer any Stranger to come into the Shop in the Day Time , and much less in the Evening , without giving an Alarm ; and this Dog was then within the House . The Master of the Family , the four Daughters and Son were also within . These can hardly be suppos 'd to be Partners with the Man in robbing the House , there being no Maid Servant there at this time . The Noise that must have been made by the Violence us 'd in the forcing the Place where the Plate was secur 'd , could not but awake any one who lay so near , unless he had been so found asleep as not to be awakened even by the Noise of a Gun . Gentlemen , this is the Nature of the Case , and the Question is , whether there be any satisfactory Evidence to convince the Court and you in Point of Law , that the Man is guilty . Q . Have you not a Dog ? Appelby . Yes . We have got a good middling siz 'd Dog ; when any comes to the Door he makes so great a Noise , that the Watchman said he would kill it . Council for the Prisoner . Mr. Appelby , are you the Son of Mr. Appleby , the Prosecutor ; you know the Defendant ; how many Months has he liv 'd with your Father ; how did he behave during that Time ; how did he behave always ? Appelby . He always behav 'd very well , 'till this very Affair happen 'd . Q . Did he use to go out often ? Appelby . No . He us 'd to go out about once a Week . He lays in the Shop ; only a Partition between the Parlour and the Shop . Q . Does any Body lie up one Pair of Stairs ? Appelby . Yes . Council . You mention the Flap of the Buroe broke open , and the Closet broke open : I would ask you whether the Prisoner knew where your Plate was kept ? Appelby . Yes . I do n't doubt , as well as we did . Council . You say the Closet Door was broke open , and the Prisoner knew where your Plate was : You said there was not Plate usually kept there . Was there any Money frequently kept there ? Appelby . That Afternoon I took almost 12 l. out of the Scrutore ; which no Doubt they would have taken . Council . Pray Mr. Appelby where does your Parlour look into . Appelby . The one Part into the Shop ; the other into the Burying Ground . Council . You say there must be a great deal of Violence us 'd , but none of the Family heard any Thing of it . Mr. Serjeant says , that at Four o'Clock in the Morning , when the Door was discover 'd to be open , none of the Things mention 'd in the Indictment were found upon this young Man at the Bar . Pray do you know any Thing of this Advertisement in the Papers ? Appelby . Yes Sir . It was by my Father 's Orders . Council . And did you find your Journeyman in Bed when you came down Stairs : You say he always gets up to let the rest of the Workmen in ; then he was in ; was he dress 'd , or half dress 'd when you came down ? Appelby . I was in such a Surprize I did not look after him . Q . Who fastned the Door ? Appelby . The Prisoner fastened the Door , and I felt of the Bolt and Things afterwards . Council . What Time was you in ? Appelby . About Twelve , or a Quarter after . Council . So then I find the Prisoner keeps better Hours than you . Q . ( to - Godyn , Watchman ) Do you beat the Rounds at Harp-Alley ? Godyn . Yes , I went every Hour . Q . Do you remember the Time when it was said the House was robb 'd ? Godyn . I was the Round every Hour in the Night . I went the regular Round every Hour . Q . Did you beat at this Door of Mr. Appelby 's ? Godyn . yes . Q . How long can you venture to say it was shut fast ? Godyn . It was shut every Hour I went my Rounds . Council . You beat it 'till Six o'Clock ? Godyn . Yes . Q . ( to Jonathan Perkins . ) What Discovery did you make ? Perkins . About half an Hour after Four I was going down to the Watch-house with my Lanthorn , and going through Harp-Alley , I saw the Door a little open . I went in and saw a Man in Bed , and bid him get up . I said get up and fasten the Door , the Shop is liable to be robb 'd : I went up to the Bedside , made the Man to get up , and he got up out of his Bed , and fastned the Door . Q . Was the Man awake or asleep ? Perkins . The Man answer 'd me readily enough then ; he said he suppos 'd there might be somebody just gone out . Q . Did you see or hear any Thing of a Dog ? Perkins . There was never a Dog bark 'd at me . Council . You went into the Shop , and made a Knock with the Watchman 's Staff just by his Bed-side ? You made a Thump with your Staff , upon that the Person answer 'd ; he did not , upon your coming first into the Shop , Cry , Who is this ? Perkins . No . Council . Only give me Leave to ask you , whether the Prisoner was without his Cloaths ? Perkins . He was . Council . He had nothing but his Shirt on ? Perkins . No , nothing else . Council . Then you went out ? Perkins . Yes , but before I had got the Length of my Cane , he got up and fastned the Door . Council . ( to Ed Cordel . ) They tell me you are Porter to Mr. Appelby . Cordel . Yes , and when I came in the Morning , a Quarter after Six , as soon as I knock 'd , my Fellow Prisoner got out of his Bed , and let me in ; and I said this Flap was open for something last Night : I ask 'd him for what , he said he forgot : I push 'd up the other Flap , then I went my Ways into the Parlour to unbolt the Parlour Window ; then I saw my Master 's Buroe , and Cupboard , by the Fireside , broke open , and I said to the Prisoner , William , Did my Master leave his Buroe so last Night ? he said I do n't know . Q . Did you examine about the House ? Did there seem to be any Force used in any Part of the House ? Cordel . There was nothing but the Flap hung loose over the Street Door ; with that we went down into the Cellar . Council against the Prisoner . I am surpriz 'd you should lie so near to this Parlour , and not hear any Thing of it . Council for the Prisoner . You would not have the Man hang 'd for being fast asleep ? Council . No ; I should be as tender of that as you are . Court . The Flap you say hung loose ? Cordel . He said the Flap was left loose last Night . Q . As you have lived with Mr. Appelby all this Time , have you known the Prisoner ? Cordel . Yes , but I never saw any Injustice by him , or any Thing of that Kind . Q . Was he up when he let you in ? Cordel . No , my Lord , he was in his Shirt . Q . Now pray what Time of the Night is Mr. Appelby 's Shop kept open ? Cordel . They are shut in between Seven and Eight o'Clock . Q . Might not a Person be conceal 'd there ? Cordel . No , I believe not ; for commonly my Master , or young Master , are near the Door . Council . ( to Mr. Appelby the Elder ) What is your Family ? Appelby . Only my Wife and self , this Son and four Daughters ; no Servant but the Prisoner . Q . What Part of the House do you lie in ? Appelby . Two Pair of Stairs forwards ? Q . Was you apprehensive of any Disturbance ? Appelby . I knew of none . Q . Can you tell that your House was safe ? Appelby . Yes , all was safe . Q . Is there any of your Family that lie so near to this Room as you ? Appelby . None so near as myself . Council . I would ask you whether it was possible for any one to come into that Room , to do any Thing without being heard by the Man in Bed ? Appelby . I think not ; then I think there is another Thing , the boldest Rogue would hardly come by that Bed , which they could scarce get by , and if they did , he might have immediately gone out and call 'd the Watch . Council . ( for the Prisoner . ) Mr. Appelby , the Prisoner has liv 'd with you four Months : I would ask you whether he behaved in a sober , modest Way ? Appelby . I believ 'd him to be very sober and honest . Q . Had you any Reason to imagine that he could be guilty of such a Crime ? I would ask whether you look upon the Prisoner at the Bar to be an artful cunning Person , or a low weak Capacity ? Appelby . He is not so ready in his Business as some People are ; but here is a Copy of a Letter to prove that he is not a Person of so mean a Capacity . Council . Have you not declar 'd since , you believed the Prisoner at the Bar to be innocent ? Appelby . No . Council . I would ask you whether you have not offer 'd any of the Prisoner 's Friends , if they would give you any Thing , you would make it up ? Did you ever know Mr. Willis ? 't was pretty late for your Son to be out ? Does your Son usually keep such Hours ? Appelby . Yes , sometimes . Council . I am sorry for your Loss ; I wish you may find out the Thief . With your Lordship 's Leave I am Council for the Prisoner . As the Serjeant has candidly open 'd it , that there was nothing but Circumstances , whether they were such Circumstances to take away the Life of a Man . The Person is indicted ; it amounts to this . Here is a Person indicted for being asleep . If a Person has any Character to support him , the Jury will never believe them , unless there are some other Circumstances . This is laid as a Crime , that a Person shall not be awaken 'd by a Noise , as that at best is but a doubtful Case . We shall call our Witness to prove that he is a most sober and honest Person . John Willis . I gave 20 l. Apprentice with the Prisoner to Mr. Norris . Council . Now I would ask you whether you had any Discourse with Mr. Appelby before ? Willis . Mr. Appelby offer 'd to make it up ; I told him and his Wife , if he ( the Prisoner ) was Guilty , I would not give Six-pence to save him from the Gallows . He is second Cousin . He is a Boy of a very shallow Capacity . Mr. Appelby gives but Seven Pounds per Year . I believe him to be innocent ; he said so before the Gentleman at my Lord Mayor 's Court . Q . How has he behaved ? Willis . Sober and well ; has always been in Places ; he was put Apprentice to a Brazier . Q . How was it that you did not set him up ? Willis . I told him , if he could cast up a Sum of 20 s. I would set him up . Council . ( to John Willis , jun . ) Was you at that Time along with your Uncle , at Mr. Appelby 's ? Willis . Yes , and I saw Mr. Appelby 's Wife and three Daughters , and I think a young Man . Council . I ask you upon your Oath , what Mr. Appelby said about the young Man ? Willis . When we went to Mr. Appelby 's House , it was upon the Circumstance of the Watchmen . Mrs. Appelby made a great Noise , and said they had never such a Misfortune before ; she said Circumstances were so strong , that it was impossible but it must be he : I said I did not know any Thing of the Circumstances , but only I had been talking with the Prisoner at the Bar a great Part of the Afternoon , and I found from his Discourse , that he must be a real honest Man ; and what confirm 'd me in it , that his Master gave him the best of Characters : One Circumstance was this ; one of the Masters that he was with , his Affairs went back in the World , and he could not employ all his Hands ; the Prisoner at the Bar was very industrious , and his Master was not willing that he should be dismissed . Council . The Question that I ask you , is , whether Mr. Appelby declar 'd any Thing at all with respect to the Prisoner at the Bar ? Willis . I intended to come to it , but I 'll answer your Question . Mr. Appelby said they were willing to make it up , if he was concern 'd in it , as being drawn in from his Weakness ; but Mr. Willis said if he was guilty , if Six-pence would save him , he would not give it . Council ( to - Norris . ) Mr. Norris , I think the young Man at the Bar serv 'd you seven Years as an Apprentice ? Norris . Yes , and he behav 'd very suitably . Q . How long has he been out of his Time ? Norris . Four or five Years , and I never heard any thing against him 'till this Time , at which I was much surpriz 'd ; I should think him one of the last Persons for such an Undertaking ; and if it was attended with any Difficulties , I do n't think he could do it , for he has but a very indifferent Capacity . While he was with me he was a very sober honest Man . Council . I suppose it was in his Power to have wrong 'd you very much , if it was his Inclination . Norris . Yes , Sir . Q . ( to - Wade . ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Wade . He work 'd with me . My Husband belong 'd to Deptford-Yard . Q . How long ago ? Wade . Above six Months . Q . Where did he go from you ? Wade . Mr. Appelby took him upon my Character . Q . How did he behave in your Service ? Wade . He behaved very honest . Council . Was he extravagant in his Expences ? Was he very sober ? You say Mr. Appelby took him upon your Character ; that is your Opinion . Q . Do you think he could be capable of breaking open his Masters Escrutore , or such Things ? Wade . No , I believe not . He lived with me a Twelvemonth , all but a few Days ; and I knew him about two Months before he came to live with me . Q . During the whole Time he lived with you , how did he behave ? Wade . I never had a better Servant in my Life , for what he was capable of doing ; he kept very good Hours , nobody came after him to spend any Money . Q . Had you heard of this unhappy Affair ? Wade . Yes , but I can not think he had Courage or Capacity for such a Thing . Council against the Prisoner . They have call 'd Witnesses to the Prisoner 's Character ; doubtless Character is a Scale to turn very much ; but 't is a wonderful Thing to me that the Plate is gone . Which way could any one get into this House ? This is the only Man that lay below , and was within hearing , and to be so very found asleep ! All Men are honest 'till they begin to be otherwise ; but they say he is a Man quite contented and easy in Disposition and Temper . We had some Difficulty to prove his Hand-writing ; but at last it comes out that 't is his Hand-writing . 'T is plain that he was restless and discontented , and it went to his very Heart , Blood and Guts of his Body , that he wanted Substance , and wanted Money , and would have his Uncle apply 'd to , to set him up . The Prisoner 's general Character was so good , and he appear 'd such a plain , simple , honest Man , that he was acquitted . His Uncle apply 'd to the Court for a Copy of his Indictment . 168.

( to Bullock . ) What have you to say for yourself ? Bullock . Please you , my Lord , I know nothing of what the Evidence says . Q . ( to Bullock . ) Have you any Witnesses ? Bullock . Not at present , my Lord . As there was no other Evidence against Dormer and Dunock , they were acquitted , but Bullock was found Guilty . [ Transportation .

Francis Archangel Monford , of the Parish of St. James 's , was indicted as a Popish Priest and an avow 'd Enemy to the Establishment of this Kingdom , who intended to divert and draw away his Majesty 's Subjects , having , on the 28th of November last , in the Hearing of divers Subjects of our Soverign Lord the King , unlawfully , and in an open , publick , audacious Manner , exercised part of the Office and Function of a Popish Priest , by celebrating Mass after the Manner of the Church of Rome , whhich is against the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , and against the Form of the Statute in that Case made and provided . Council . May it please your Lordship , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , I am Council in this Prosecution against the Defendant , who is now in Judgment before you for an Offence , we apprehend , he has has been guilty of against an Act of Parliament made in the Time of King William the Third for preventing the Growth of Popery : 'T is not a Spirit of Persecution , but Self-preservation , that makes us enforce that Law at this time of Day . If our Ancestors thought it necessary , at that Time , to put a further Restriction upon the Attempts of designing artful Men , who endeavour to seduce and inveigle People away from the Religion in which they were brought up , I believe it will be the Judgment of every one that observes what Times we are fallen into , that we ought to oppose the Designs of our cunning Adversaries , who are endeavouring to seduce the People from the pure Religion exercised in this Kingdom . The Indictment on which the Defendant stands accused is grounded on an Act of Parliament made in the 11th and 12th Years of his Majesty King William the Third , which has expresly prohibited the Exercise of the Popish Religion , in any Degree whatsoever . If the Protestants abroad should attempt the publick Exercise of their Religion , they would be try 'd by Rage and Fury , not left to the Judgment of twelve Men , but to the Inquisition , & c. But we permit all to come to a Trial fairly and upon Oath . This , Gentlemen , I thought proper to mention to you ; because 't is extremely necessary some Stop should be put to Men that endeavour to draw away People from the true Protestant Religion . 'T is evident that the Defendant has endeavour 'd to seduce People by celebrating one of the Sacraments , in baptizing a Child in the Popish Way . Gentlemen , it seems the present Defendant , Mr. Francis Monford , otherwise Archangel Monford , exercised his Office at a Place in Warwick-Street , where a Multitude of People assembled together ; among the rest several Procestants : This we shall shew , by the Witnesses who are present , that he did actually do , in the very same Form and Manner , and according to the Usage of the Church of Rome ; therefore those that were concern 'd at the Sight thought proper to make a Discovery of it . If he has no Authority or Qualification within the Letter of the Law , we shall prove , with Submission to the Court , that he is culpable by the Act of Parliament before mention 'd . My Lord , I shall now call Patrick Slowman to prove that the Defendant is guilty . Q . ( to Patrick Slowman . ) What are you , a Protestant or a Papist ? Slowman . A Protestant . Q . What Countryman are you ? Slowman . An Irishman . Q . Do you know the Defendant . Slowman . On the Evening of the Day that the Defendant at the Bar was taken I was going home , there was a Crowd at Sir Thomas De Veil 's : The Evening of the Day I can not tell , Sir Thomas has got it , I think he declar 'd it was the 12th of December . I saw the Prisoner at the Bar ; I myself was not any way concern 'd . Q . Did you know him before ? Slowman . Yes , my Lord . Q . Do you know that he is a Popish Priest ? You are to answer the Questions that the Council or I ask you ; I desire to know whether you have any reason to think this Man is a Popish Priest ? Slowman . My Lord , I believe that he is so . My Lord , about five or six Weeks before last Christmas I was , with some Friends I met , at the Portuguese Chapel in Warwick-Street , and I saw Mr. Monford there ; three of them were dress 'd all alike , and three Boys dress 'd in a different Manner . Q . Do you know what the Dress of a Popish Priest is ? Slowman . No . Q . Do you any otherwise know that he is a Priest than by your seeing him in the Portuguese Chapel ? Court to the Council . Gentlemen , you must prove that he is a Popish Priest ; the Witness says he only saw him in the Popish Chapel ; by the same reason it may be said this Gentleman is so himself . Council . I know but little of it , neither do I desire to know it : This Gentleman , the Witness , has expresly swore that he heard him say Mass several Times . Sir Thomas De Veil to the Witness . Sir , I read this Information with as much Circumspection as I could ; you did swear to me that this Gentleman did say Mass several Times ; that you knew the Place of his Birth , and that he was a Subject of Great Britain ; upon which I committed him . Q . How long have you known him ? Slowman . I have known him two or three Years . Council . Therefore I ask you once more whether you have any reason to believe he is a Popish Priest , any otherwise than that you saw him at the Popish Chapel ? Did you hear him say any thing or not ? Slowman . I did not . Q . Do you know the Dress of a Popish Priest ? Slowman . I do not . Q . ( to John Kettle . ) What Religion are you of ? Kettle . I am a Protestant . Q . Do you know the Defendant at the Bar . Kettle . Yes , for two Years past . Q . Do you know what is his Profession ? Kettle . I went the Saturday before Easter Sunday to the Romish Chapel in Warwick-Street , and I saw the Defendant there in a white Surplice , cross 'd down the Back . Q . Did he read any thing ? Kettle . Yes , he had a Book in his Hand ; I could not hear what he read . There was a great Congregation of People . Court . Then you could not tell what he read ? Kettle . No . Q . Do you know any thing else of his being a Popish Priest ? Was there any distributing of Bread and Wine ? Kettle . No . But I was there last Christmas was twelve Month ; I saw him then sipping out of Cup ; and he read something afterwards . Q . Did he administer it to any Body else ? Kettle . No . They never do . Q . Can you tell in what Language it was he read ? Kettle . No . Q . In what Posture was he when he had the Cup ; was he standing up by the Communion-Table ; was any of the Congregation near him ? Kettle . Some of them were down upon their Knees ; and he took the Cup and held it up as high as his Head . Q . ( to John Hibbs ) Do you know any Thing of the Defendant , Mr. Manford ? Hibbs . I was at the taking of him . Q . Do you know what is his Business ? Hibbs . He is a computed Priest . Court . You mean a reputed Priest . Hibbs . Yes . Q . What Reason have you to say that he is a reputed Priest ? Hibbs . He us 'd to visit a Lady next Door to our House ; and that Lady is a Roman Catholick . Council . According to this , then every Man that visits a Lady that is a Protestant , is a Protestant . Q . Did you ever see him officiate as a Popish Priest ? Did you ever hear him confess any Thing ? Hibbs . No . Acquitted . 188. Anne Murphey was indicted for feloniously stealing a Silver Watch , the Property of - Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 189.

Said I , are you a Fortune Reader ?

But do n't you deal with the Devil , I said : Says she you must pull your Rings off ; said I , I have been a Wife these 18 Years , and have had eight Children , and have never pull 'd them off . Says she , there is Gold and Silver hid in this House , there is 400 l. of King William 's Gold hid in this Place ever since King William 's Time , and shall be your 's within an Hour , if you will follow my Directions ; and where you are worth a Penny you shall be worth a Pound . I trembled and shook , I said , sure the Woman deals with the Devil , I said , do you ? No , said the Prisoner ; but only cast a Figure . All the Gold and Silver ( says she ) you have in the House , you must bring to me : She said , God must be her Saviour , and I should have it ; And I was in such a Condition , in a Trance , or some such Thing . Q . Did you pull off your Rings ? Pile . Yes . And they were put into a Paper , and she said , as God should be her Judge she would have but 12 d. to the Pound ; she put my Rings and Spoon , as I thought , in my Bosom , but I could not find them any more . Q . Did you think you had them in your Bosom ? Pile . Please you my Lord , she put me into such a Condition , that I thought I should have died . Q . Where were the Rings and the Tea Spoon ? Pile . In the Paper . Q . Did she put them into your Bosom ? Pile . I thought she did , but I never had them in my Bosom , tho ' I thought I had : So she went out , and was to bring this Money to me in a Quarter of an Hour ; but she did not return again ; and I could not find her 'till Monday .

Q . Had it any Marks of Violence ? Moseley . The Arm and Leg , and the bottom Part was knowed with Rats , and sadly mortify 'd , that we could not tell what it was ; but as she said herself that it was a Girl , for no-body could tell what it was . Q . Have you any Thing further ? Moseley . No , my Lord . Q . ( to Mary Jane ) What do you know of this Matter ? Jane . I live just by the Compter . The Church-warden and the rest of the Gentlemen were pleas 'd to send for me , and when I came , there was a little Bandbox stood upon the Table , and the Coroner swore me ; they took off the Lid of the Box , and it was such a shocking Sight , that it almost took away my Senses : After I was recover 'd , I examined it as well as I could , but it seemed to be so knawed and destroyed by Vermin , that it was not to be discerned . Whether it was Male or Female , I do n't know , but she said it was a Female Child . Q . Was the Child you saw in the Bandbox , the same that was taken out of the Vault ? Did this appear to be a full-grown Child ? Jane . I can not tell , my Lord . Q . What is your Opinion ? Jane . I really ca n't say , my Lord , whether it was or was not ; if it was not at its Time , I believe it must be very near , it was wasted , there was but one Hand left . Q . Was there Nails upon the Hand ? Jane . Small Nails , my Lord . Q . Was there any Hair ? Jane . No , my Lord , I did not apprehend any Thing of that ; but I was so shocked with the Sight of it , that I was almost dead . Q . Who carried the Woman to the Compter ? Jane . She used to go to a Man that she had lived with , and had three or four-Children by . Aaron Levi . What do you know concerning the Prisoner at the Bar coming to the Compter ? Levi . She was committed by my Lord Mayor to our Place . Q . Did she use to come there before ? Levi . Yes , my Lord , she came to a Man that she pretended was her Brother ; but I find it was a Man that she had lived with before , and had some Children by him . Court . She called this Man her Brother , did she ? Do you know any Thing to the contrary that he was not her Brother ? Levi . I believe he was not ; the Prisoner confessed that she had thrown the Child into the Vault , and she brought it there in a Handkerchief . Q . Did she tell you whether the Child was alive when she threw it in ? Levi . No , my Lord , for I did not ask her that Question . Q . Did it appear to you to be a full-grown Child ? Levi . I ca n't say , my Lord , I have very little Judgment in it . Court . ( to the Prisoner . ) Now is your Time to make your Defence : You hear what has been sworn against you , that you threw a Child into the Vault in the Compter , and you confessed it . Prisoner . Please you , my Lord , I was brought to-bed half an Hour after Two o'Clock on Wednesday Morning ; I went out about Nine in the Morning , I went to Wood-Street Compter , and threw it down ; it was born dead , and had been so for two or three Days before , by a Hurt I got . Q . How came you not to give some Notice ? Prisoner . Please you , my Lord , I was a Servant , and would not disgrace myself : I was making Prepara tions for it : I did it to hide Shame , and to be sure I got more . I got a Hurt on Saturday as I was Washing , and the Child was dead-born , it was never born alive . Q . Have you any to prove that you got any Hurt ? Prisoner . No , I never spoke of it to any Body . I had made some Preparations , but the Woman that made them for me is now sick a-bed , and sent them to me Yesterday . Q . How did you get this Hurt ? Prisoner . Please you , my Lord , I was hanging up of Cloaths , and the Stool I stood upon , slipt from under me , and I had my Arms up , and I fell down on Saturday in the Afternoon . Q . Where was you washing ? Prisoner . I was washing in the Compter , please you my Lord ; I used to go there every Day . Q . ( to Mary Pritchard ) You lodged in the next Room , did you hear any Cry ? Pritchard . No , I never heard any Cry , nor my Sister did not hear any Thing of it . Acquitted . 191. Jane Wilson was indicted for that not having the Fear of God before her Eyes , but stirred and moved by the Instigation of the Devil , falsly , deceirfully , and feloniously , to deceive and defraud , on the 27th Day of March , 20 Pieces of false , forged , counterfeit Money and Coin , to the Likeness and Similitude of lawful and current Money , called Shillings , did coin and utter , against the Duty of her Allegiance , and against the Form and Statute in that Case made and provided . Susannah Jones . How long have you known the Prisoner at the Bar ? Jones . Fifteen Years . Q. Pray , during that Time , what Way of Livelihood has she followed ? Jones . At first she lived in a pretty Way . About ten Years we have been abroad together , and gone out together in this Affair , in making of Money . Q . Have you known her coin Money at any Time ? What Fact have you known her guilty of , in respect of making of Money together . [ Some Money was produced ] Withers . Had you that same Money from Susannah Jones ? Jones . These same Pieces of Money viewed by the Justice , Mr. Withers , she and I made . Council . You must not talk of She 's , there 's five thousand of them . Q . Did the Prisoner make these twelve Shillings ? Jones . I ca n't say but I did help her ? Q . Let us see what Part she did , and what Part you did , in making these Pieces . Who made the Mould of the Plaister of Paris ? Jones . I made the Impression by a good Shilling . The Prisoner held the Mould while I pour 'd in the Metal . Q . What is the next Step to making them ? Jones . She and I put them out , and I not being well that Night , when I went to Bed I desir 'd her to get them ready , and she scour 'd them and went down with one of the said Shillings . Q . You say , she held the Mould made of Plaister of Paris , while you took the Impression off the good Shilling . Who cast them in the Mould ? Jones . She and I together . Q . When was it that you did cast them ? Jones . In the Morning , at Four o'Clock , Sir : We were both concern 'd together ; I held the Moulds , and she pour 'd the Metal in . Q . Can you say that these twelve Pieces you produced , were produced by the Metal she pour 'd into the Mould . Jones . Yes . Q . How do you know ? Jones . These Pieces were ne'er out of my Custody before I gave them to the Justice ; they were not , upon my Word and Honour . Q . Who fil 'd these twelve ? How came you by them ? Jones . Sir , she was with me ; we were both together when they were made . Q . Who scour 'd them ? Jones . The Prisoner at the Bar . Q . After you had scour 'd and finish 'd them , what did you do with them ? Jones . She and I used to go out together ; she used always to take a Hand-Basket , and I used to go along with her : Sometimes she used to go to Market , and sometimes I . When I came to her , I used to give her the Change . Q . When you had put it off , what did you do then ? Jones . Why then , Sir , I used to give her the Change ; then I took another Shilling to put off . Q . Now I would ask you , for how long a Time you went on in this Way ? Jones . Ten Years we have gone out together in this Way . Q . Who was it that you discover 'd this iniquitous Practice to ? Jones . I was very uneasy about it ; for sometimes she would get drunk , and then she would threaten me . I first sent to the Gentleman , Mr. Buckman , within these three Weeks , and I said , I am very uneasy now my Children are grown out of the Way ; and I am frighten 'd and threaten 'd by a Person what she will do ; and I will now leave it off . Q. Pray what Impression had the Moulds ? Jones . King William the Third . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Would you ask her any Questions ? Prisoner . No , my Lord . Q . ( to Walter Buckman . ) Look upon the Prisoner at the Bar , Do you know her ? Buckman . My Lord , I never saw her in my Life , 'till this Affair was discover 'd . The Evidence , Mrs. Jones , sent for me : When I came she said , I am something concern 'd I did not send to you before ; I have sent for you for something besides the Coat . When she sent to me she was very sober , and under a great Concern ; and I was very sober myself . She said , I do assure you , Mr. Buckingham , I have something upon my Spirits that concerns me ; I am determin 'd to make myself a voluntary Evidence . An Evidence , In what ? I said . Says she , I have been concern 'd in Coining , and putting off bad Money . I said I would go and speak to a Person that I knew , who was one Vernon . Q . Who is Vernon ? Buckman . He is an Officer belonging to the Marshalsea Court . Q . What are you ? Buckman . I am a Taylor . Q . So when you came to her about the Coat , she mention 'd something to you about Coining , did she ? Buckman . Yes ; and she nam 'd one Wilson . Court . You said you would send or go to one Vernon , Did you meet with him ? Buckman . I brought him along with me . Q . Then what past in the Presence of Vernon , you and her , altogether ? Buckman . She said , To be sure I am guilty of a very heinous Crime ; I 'll make myself a voluntary Evidence : I have two Children , and I am willing to discover the Thing . Said Mr. Vernon , Where does this Woman live ? So she sent her little Boy with us to the House where the Prisoner was ; the Boy pointed to an elderly Woman , and the poor Woman fell a crying . I said to Mr. Vernon , this poor Creature looks like an innocent Person . The other Woman facing the Chimney-Corner seem 'd to be sideling to get away ; I said , I fansy that Woman must be the guilty Person ; send for Mrs. Jones , to see if this is not the Woman . When Mrs. Jones came , she declar 'd that was the Woman . Counsel . Now , Mr. Buckman , tell the Court what Susannah Jones had said of her being concern 'd with any other in counterfeiting of Money before you went out with Mr. Vernon , Did she mention any Name ? Buckman . Yes , a Name ; but I ca n't remember the Name . She said she was concern 'd with such a Woman , living at a Silver-spinner 's . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) Would you ask this Witness any Questions ? Prisoner . I never saw him in my Life . Q . ( to Richard Vernon . ) Look upon the Prisoner at the Bar , What is it that you know of her ? Vernon . I was drinking a Pint of Beer in Whitecross-Street ; Buckman , the other Witness , came to me , and ask 'd me to go with him , to be concern 'd in taking a Coiner : I went up along with him to this Woman 's , the Witness . When I came up she seem 'd to be afraid , and said , I have been concern 'd in Coining , but am willing to leave that Trade off . Said I , How many is concern 'd with you ? she said but one ; which is the Prisoner at the Bar . Her Boy went along with me to shew me the House ; but when I came in I made a little Mistake ; I said , Madam , you must go along with me ; you have been concern 'd in Coining of Money . The Woman fell a crying ; I saw the Prisoner at the Bar make a sideling about ; I said , Do n't you run away , for I fansy you are the Woman . So when Mrs. Jones came up , she said , that was the Woman . Q . As you was going before the Justice , had you any Talk with her ? Vernon . I can not say I was very curious to have much Conversation with her ; but I said to her , that Coining was a very bad Trade ; you have coin 'd yourself in Rags . Said she , I wish I had been a little sooner , I would have turn 'd Evidence : I wish I had been an Evidence myself ; but now 't is too late . Q . ( to Mary Evans . ) Look at the Prisoner ; How long have you known her ? Evans . Fourteen or fifteen Years ; she shew 'd me a Pair of Moulds about six Weeks ago . Q . Where did she come to you ? Evans . She came to my Apartment in Whitecross-street , and said they were Susannah Jones 's . Q . Did you look at them ? Evans . She open 'd them in her Hand , and there was King Williams 's Head on one Side , and cross Bars , like ours ; she said , that Mrs. Jones did this Sort of Business . Q . Did she say that she did any Thing to ? Evans . She shew 'd me one Shilling , as she could not put it off ; but she did not know how she ( Susannah Jones ) put off so many . Q . Where was it she shew 'd it to you ? Evans . At my own Room . Prisoner . May I speak to Mrs. Evans . Mrs. Evans , Have you not known me ever since the Death of old King George ? Evans . Yes ; and I never knew any Harm of you in my Life . When first I knew her she kept a School at Hoxton ; I never knew an ill Character of her . She went to Service and Charing , and did little Matters for me . Prisoner . And you know I have lodg 'd with you two or three Years together . Evans . She never lodg 'd so long together . Q . Did you know this Mrs. Jones ? Evans . The Prisoner told me she liv 'd with this Mrs. Jones as a Servant . Q . ( to Anne Holster . ) What is your Business ? Holster . My Business is to make the Plaister of Paris . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Holster . I do n't know but she may have been at my House , but I ca n't very well tell . Court . Go close to her , look at her ; Do you know her or not ? Holster . I can not say I do know her positively . Matthew Solam . My Lord , I was charg 'd by the Constable to aid and assist him to carry the Prisoner to New Prison . She said this wicked Woman has sworn that I coin 'd with her ten or twelve Years , when I have never been concern 'd in making Money for above three Months past . I hope , when Mr. North comes I shall be admitted an Evidence ; because he has been try 'd at Kingston upon such an Affair before ; for Jones had said , For God 's sake , if you inform against me , you will ruin me for ever . Further , the Prisoner said she was concern 'd in putting them off , but had not coin 'd with her above three Months . Q . ( to Thomas Brown . ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Brown . Three Months and better . Q . What is her Character ? Brown . I have heard a good Character of her ; that she always has been a Working Woman . Q . ( to Elizabeth Walton . ) How long have you known this Woman ? Walton . About ten Years ; and she is an industrious laborious Creature , and always poor . Q . Was she idle or willing to work ? Walton . Willing to work ; when she was sick I have beg 'd many a Shilling of her Relations for her . Q . ( to Sarah Brown . ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Brown . Three Months ; while she was with me she behav 'd in a very handsome Manner . Q . How came she to go from you to Mrs. Jones ? Brown . Mrs. Jones came and took her in our House ; she said she could not rest nor sleep while she was with her , and said I am glad I am away from her . The Evidence , Jones , swore one Time , that she would swear through a Deal Board to be reveng 'd of her ; she swore this in my Mother-in-Law 's House . Q . Did you hear Susannah Jones say this yourself ? Brown . Yes , I did , at White-Horse-Court in Whitecross-street . Q . ( to Sarah Brown . ) What do you know of this Matter ? Brown . This Susannah Jones took Lodgings in my House : The first Night she came she made abundance of Confusion in my Room . The next Morning I went up Stairs ; I said , Mrs. Jones , I desire you would quit my Room . She answer 'd me , No , d - n you , I 'll stay the Week . I often heard knocking and Confusion , and a Pack of Black-guards coming after her ; with that I got shut of her . When she left her Room I went to clean it , and found some Metal among the Ashes . Q . Can you say any Thing of the Prisoner ? Brown . I believe she is a very honest Woman , I have known her not above a Fortnight ; but I know nothing of Wilson but Honesty . Q . ( to George Wiskin . ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? George Wiskin . About five Weeks . I was at my Cousin Brown 's , and they have entrusted her with a great Quantity of Silver and Gold , and they never missed any Thing in the World . Upon the summing up of the Evidence , his Lordship , among other Things , thus expressed himself : There are two Things very plain , that Susannah Jones , the Witness , is an exceeding wicked Woman ; that she hath been concerned in this Thing for a Matter of ten Years , and 't is , I think , as plain , that before this Woman came acquainted with Jones , she was a hard-working Woman ; that she was extremely concerned during the little Time she lived with her ; and that she was drawn into this Practice ; therefore I could have wished that Susannah Jones might have been prosecuted , and this poor Woman made an Evidence , & c. Acquitted . 192. William Hopwood was indicted for stealing one Seat Cloth , belonging to the Coach of Sir Richard Hoare , Knt . and one Cloth Great Coat . Q .

Bayl . We never discover 'd it 'till the 5th of March ; it might have been lost the 2d of March : We lost Sir Thomas Bull 's Man 's Coat the 7th of March .
