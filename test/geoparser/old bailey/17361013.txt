Charles Serjeant . On the 22d of September last . I was going home to Uxbridge , at the first Bridge , a little below Notting hill , I was stopped by two Men , it was between 6 and 7 o'Clock in the Evening , and I was riding after the rate of 10 Miles an Hour . I saw People , and cried Hallo , but they presently dismounted me , one took hold of my Leg and threw me off the Horse , and the other caught me on the other side . One of them held a Hanger to my Breast , and said , if you do not hold your Tongue , I will put you to death . They led me to a Gate that opens into a Field just below the Bridge , and robbed me of 4 Guineas and a half , stripped me stark naked as I was born , and took every thing I had in the World , ( Breeches and all ) except my Wig , and carried me to a Tree ; they spoke in French to one another , and said , Il faut que vous obeyez : Then the Prisoner put a Handkerchief cross my Mouth , and tied it on the Nape of my Neck with two hard Knots ; with my Bridle they bound me to the Tree , and then left me . In this Condition I was for two Hours , but my Hands being very cold , I slipped them at last through the Bridle ; so I got loose , and went to the Sign of I have brought my Hogs to a fine Market . About 7 o'Clock they stripped me , and about 9 I got to this House . The Prisoner put my Breeches on before my Face , and this Coat I have now on my Back is the same he took from me , the rest of the Things are in Court , and were all taken upon him . I swear to the Prisoner 's Hair and his Tongue , for I took notice of his thick shock Head of Hair hanging over his Face , and am sure he is the Man . William Walmsley . The Prisoner ( and another Man ) came through Rosemary . Lane with this Whip in his Hand the 23d of last Month . I said to one that was with me , that Fellow has got a good cleaver Whip , ask him if he will sell it : Yes , says the Prisoner , it is to be sold . I asked him what he would have for it ; he said half a Guinea : I desired my Neighbour to bid him . D F for it , that is in the way we mark our Goods 4 s. 6 d. I am a Pawnbroker , and sell Cloaths , and so I mark my Goods . The Prisoner would not take 4 s. 6 d. so he bid him a Crown , then 6 s. and at last he allowed it us for 7 s. and a Gallon of Beer . We let them go off , but the Prisoner gave it his Companion , and he brought it back and took 6 s. and 6 d. for it . While he was brushing the Whip , I observed the Name Charles Serjeant at Uxbridge graved in a silver Plate on the Butt End . So , says I , this Whip is stole , or somebody has been robbed , let us go down into Rag Fair and see for the Men ; upon that , we went down about 30 Yards towards the Fair , and then turned back , for I was but a Servant and could not neglect my Master 's Business ; so these two Fellows went after them but could not find them . They were no sooner come back , but I saw the Prisoner ( and the other Man ) coming along with the young Man 's Coat upon his Arm ; the Man that lives next Door to me bought the Coat for 8 s. Tom , says I , here are the two Men , take care of them . He went to them , and said , I hear the Man that owns the Whip lives at Uxbridge , upon which the Prisoner wanted to have the Whip again ; and when he had returned the Money he endeavoured to make off , but we stopped him , and he told us , if we would go with him he would shew us the Person from whom he had it . He carried us to the Bull Inn in Holborn , and there we did indeed find how he came by it , though I did not go to the Inn with him my self , but these next Witnesses , for I was but a Servant . Charles Serjeant . I swear this is the Whip which the Prisoner took from me when I was robbed . Walmsley . And 't is the very Whip he sold for 6 s. 6 d. to this Man . - Lynell . I was standing at my own Door , and the Prisoner and another Man came by with this Whip : Walmsley asked him if it was to be sold , he said yes , and gave it into my Hand ; the Price , he said , was half a Guinea . I observed the Grasp to be stitch 'd with Wire , so I bid him 6 s. for it , then 6 s. 6 d. he allow 'd it at last for 7 s. and went 5 or 6 Doors off , and told me I should have it for 6 s. 6 d. and a Gallon of Beer ; I told him I would give no more , so he sent it me by his Companion , for my own Price , and then they both went off . There was a very cleaver Horse engrav 'd on the Whip , and I was shewing it to some of my Neighbours , who observed likewise the Name , Charles Serjeant at Uxbridge upon the Butt-end . About half an Hour after this , the Prisoner came up again , to sell this very Coat which the Gentleman has now upon his Back ; when he had sold it , I desired to speak a Word with him : I took him in Doors and said , take your Whip again , I do n't think you came honestly by it : Why , says he , I 'll carry you to the Man I had it from , 't is but upon Tower-Hill damn it says the other , what Occasion have ; you to trouble your self about it ? Give him his Money again , so I took my Money and return 'd him the Whip : But another Person saying Mr. Serjeant 's Coach came in at the Bull , we took the Prisoner thither , and asked them if Mr. Serjeant 's Coach came in there ; they told us it would be there in a quarter of an Hour . While we were waiting . I asked the Prisoner , if he had bought nothing but this Whip ? Yes , says he , this Wastcoat which I have on , the Coat , which I have sold , and a Hat , which I gave 2 s. for , I asked him what he gave for all the rest of the Things , and he told me 8 s. When the Coach came in , we found Mr. Serjeant had been stripp 'd , so we search 'd the Prisoner ; and the first Things we took out of his Pocket , was a Spoon , on which was wrote , Charles Serjeant , at Uxbridge , and a Knife with two Blades , and a pair of steel Snuffers I put the Prisoner into a Coach , and he was carry 'd to Sir Richard Brocas , while I rid to Uxbridge to inform Mr. Serjeant , what we had done . Prisoner . They took Money from me , which no Man in the World has any thing to say to , but my self . Charles Serjeant . This Spoon , Knife , and these Snuffers , the Prisoner took from me ; they are mine : he confess 'd the Fact before Sir Richard Brocas . The Confession of the Prisoner being proved , it was read in Court . The voluntary Confession of William Rine , taken this 1st of October , before Sir Richard Brocas , Knt . & c. ' Who confesseth and saith , that about a Month ' ago , he the said William Rine , with Benjamin ' Finnegar , and Bryan Darby , assaulted and Robbed ' 2 Men in the Fields at Islington , and with ' the said Benjamin Finnegar , and Bryan Darby , ' he robb 'd a Man by Hampstead , of Coffee and ' Tea , and all his wearing Apparel : And that ' on the 22d of September last , he with the ' same Persons , about 8 in the Evening , near ' Kensington Gravel Pits , assaulted and robb 'd ' Mr. Charles Serjeant of a Coat , Wastcoat , ' Breeches , Hat , Whip , & c. Prisoner . The People told me , it would be better for me to confess , than to say I was not there . These People came to me in Jayl , and desired me to confess , and to say I was along with these Men , robbing every Body : There are People enough in the Town , that know me , but I believe no Body is here but my Land lady , and she knows nothing of the Matter Guilty Death . 2 Mary Kempton , otherwise Campton , was indicted for stealing 3 Suits of Cambrick Headcloaths value 26 s. 3 pair of Cambrick doubl Ruffles value 7 s. 6 d. 3 half Handkerchiefs laced value 4 s. 6 d. 1 pair of Gold Ear-rings value 3 s. 2 silver Girdle Buckles value 2 s. 2 silver Girdles value 1 s. a cambrick Tucker value 1 s. a silk Gown value 30 s. a silk Petticoat value 15 s. a damask Gown , lined with Silk value 50 s. a damask Petticoat value 25 s. 2 Holland Sheets value 15 s. 2 Pillowbiers value 3 s. a Holland Shirt value 9 s. 9 holland Shirts value 20 s. 2 dimity Wastcoats value 1 s. 6 d. a diaper Table Cloth value 2 s. and other Things , the Goods of John Lewis .

And a camblet Gown value 4 s. a poplin Petticoat value 3 s. the Goods of Elenor Knelms , in the dwelling House of William Green , September 16 . William Green . On the 16th of September , I was fetch 'd to Mr . Kitchen 's a Pawnbroker , where I found the Prisoner , who was my Servant , and one Gardiner Wright in Custody of the Constable . Mrs. Lewis had left 2 Trunks at my House , while she went to Holland ; I found they had pawn 'd a Suit of red damask Clothes , which I had seen Mrs. Lewis wear : Upon this I went home to examine the Trunks , I found the Cords of one cut at the Bottom , but the Ends were strained and put under the Trunk , that as it stood they seemed to be all whole , and the Lock was open . Then I went and asked my Maid , how she could do such a Thing ? and she own 'd she had taken the Things mention 'd in the Indictment , of Mrs. Lewis 's , out of the Trunk . She confess 'd she had taken a Band-box of Linnen , 3 Suits of Headcloths , and the 3 half Handkerchiefs , 3 pair of double Ruffles , 2 Girdles , and silver Buckles to them , one set with Stones , and a little Case , with a pair of gold Ear Rings . A Padesoy Gown , she own 'd she took out of another Trunk ; and this Confession she made while she was in the Constable 's Custody . One pair of Holland Sheets , she had lent to a Neighbour , and were found on their Bed . Two Wastcoats we found at Mr. Wright 's , and a bundle of Linnen , which she had taken out of the Trunks , we found under the Prisoner 's Bed . Three Shifts , a Sheet , and 2 dimity Petticoats , were pawn 'd by one Ann Gaines ; she took a Callimanco Gown of my Wife 's , and an old Shirt of mine ; a Camblet Gown and a Poplin Petticoat of Mrs. Knelms ; one Shift of Mrs. Lewis 's she had on her Back , when she was taken . Mary Lewis . I left two Trunks at Mr. Greens while I went to my Husband in Holland ; while I was gone , they were cut and broke , and the Things mentioned in the Indictment taken away . Some of the Linnen the Prisoner had cut up , some Things she had given away , which were sent me again when she was taken up . I put up in those Trunks 3 suits of laced Headcloaths , 3 pair of double Ruffles , and half Handkerchief , a pair of gold Ear Rings , 2 silver Girdles and Buckles , one of them set with Stones , a Cambrick Tucker , a silk Gown and Coat , a suit of black Padesoy , 2 Holland Sheets , 2 Pillowbiers , a Holland Shirt , and 5 Shifts , 2 Dimity Wastcoats , a Table Cloth , a Silk Apron , and a Muslin Apron , all which I miss 'd out of the Trunks ; she had cut the Cords , opened the Locks , and one of these Trunks I found cut at one End . Robert Piercy . Sue Wright brought the 3 Suits of Headcloaths to our House to pawn , with 3 pair of Ruffles , and 3 half Handkerchiefs , a Tucker , a pair of gold Ear Rings , 2 Silver Girdles and Buckles My Master 's Name is Bower ; we asked whose Goods they were , and she told us , they belonged to a substantial House Keeper , who was in Trouble : We knew Wright and lent her Money on them . Mr. Lewis . These are my Goods now produced . Susan Wright . I have nothing to say against the Prisoner . I took her to be honest ; she told me these Things belonged to Mr. Westby in Charter house Square ; she said he had beat a Man , and his Life being despaired of , Mr. Westby was thrown into Clerkenwell Prison , and this Money was to support him there . I had a Guinea and a half upon them , and she gave me a Shilling for my Trouble . Gardiner Wright . The Prisoner brought a black Padesoy Gown and Petticoat to my Room , and desired me to pawn them for Money to redeem Mr. Westby out of Trouble . I got 40 s. upon them , and had a Shilling my self ; these are the Cloaths I pawned . Mrs. Lewis . These Cloaths are mine . Q . Have you any Witnesses ? ( To the Prisoner . ) Prisoner . No , I did this by my self , no body was with me , so I have nothing to say in the Business . Guilty Death . 3. John Ingle , was indicted for stealing 3 Crimson Mohair Bed Curtain lined with Thread Sattin value 30 s. and 3 yellow Camblet Bed Curtains head with Sattin value 20 s. and one Callico Quilt value 10 s. the Goods of the most noble James Duke of Chandos , September 13 . Richard Lund . These Goods were in my Custody ( I being Groom of the Chambers ) at my Lord Duke 's House at Cannons ; they were part of General Pepper 's Furniture , and my Lord bought them about seven Years ago , but fearing there might be Vermin in them , they were laid in a Room over the Stables , and I believe none of the Servants in the House ever saw them but my self . Prisoner . How long have you lost these Things ? Lund . I did not miss them 'till my Lord ordered me into Berkshire ; and I think that was the 27th of September . Prisoner . I have had them 3 Years since May last . Lund . The Goods were taken away in Curtains , but I took them in the Prisoner 's Lodging made up into Cloaths . After I had missed them , I was walking down the Town , and I saw this Gown through the Window : I suspected it was part of the Lining of the Camblet Curtains . This Mohair Gown I found in his Wife 's Drawers , and this Skirt of a Child 's Coat is the same yellow Sattin that lined the Curtains . I found some Pieces not made up ; here is a Piece of a Curtain , four Breadths of Camblet a little faded ; and I shall now produce a Curtain to answer it . Here is a Breadth and a half of the same Camblet , this is a Head Curtain , and here is the other : Now here is a single Breadth of the same found at his Lodging . This is a Wastcoat made of the Crimson Mohair . Here , Gentlemen , is a yellow Curtain lined with yellow Sattin ; this piece of the same I found at Thomas Loyd 's where he lodged , and this yellow Gown , which has been worn . I found a piece of the Crimson Mohair in his Sister 's House . Robert Bunn . We took these Things out of the Prisoner 's Lodging , and went before Colonel Dobbins ; when we came back we searched his Sister 's House , and found these two quilted Coats ; one is all Crimson Mohair , and the other is Crimson Mohair paned with white Sattin , and here is a Camblet yellow Gown faced and robed with Crimson Mohair ; she told us her Brother gave them to her , he was present and owned he did so . All these Things which we found on them we compared before Colonel Dobbins , with the Remainder , which Mr. Lund had in his Custody , and we took them to be the same Goods . The Prisoner told us he bought them of a Servant of the Duke 's who is now dead . Lund . These Breadths of crimson Mohair I took with the Petticoats , and if you compare them with the Curtains I have brought , you will find them to be the very same . We found these five Breadths of Sattin hid in a Hedge in that Gentleman 's Field . 'T is my Opinion he took them , though he said he bought them of a Maid Servant for a Guinea ; that Maid had a very honest Character . Prisoner . My Wife wore this Gown publickly when she went to the Duke 's House . Lund . I know nothing of that . The rest of the Servants was unacquainted with this Furniture . Prisoner . Mr. Lund has entrusted me all over the Duke 's House : I used to look after the Waters , and there never was laid any Thing to my Charge before . Lund . He did look after the Waters , and has been all over the House , even in the Water Closets ; but I have missed these two Years a silver Tea Canister that weighs 7 oz . and the Reason he was turned out of my Lord 's Service , was for a suspicion we had of his hiding himself by my Lord 's Library Door , where the Maids put their Mops and Brooms , and cutting out a Pannel of the Wainscot . I had a good Opinion of him 'till then , but he was then turned off . Herbert Russel . I went with Mr. Lund , and saw these Goods taken at the Prisoner 's , and his Sister 's Lodging . He told us he had given his Sister what we found upon her , and that he bought them for a Guinea . We found 5 Breadths of white Sattin in a Hedge in one of my Fields ; the Woman ( his Sister ) directed me to it . I never knew any thing of him 'till this Affair . John Chertsy . I thought ( as how ) he bought them : I asked no Questions on neither side . Prisoner 's Defence . Those Things I bought , and if you please I will tell you how . I used to go up and down the House to fetch the Ashes away , and clean the Grate Hole in the Kitchen . A young Woman that lived there , asked me three or four times whether I was almost married , because if I was ( she said ) she had some things that would be of service to me , and she would sell them to me . I said no - sometimes I said I was , sometimes I was not ; but however , one Day I was sitting by the Fire-side in the Garden Lodge , and this Creature brought the things to me . John , says she , I have brought the Things I was telling you about . I hope , said I , I shall not come into trouble about them . No , said she , I care not who sees them , or who hears of them , but I would not have them come to my Father 's Ear . I bought them , and kept them in my Cupboard a Fortnight , and when I was turned away , they gave no Account of the Occasion why I must go ; so I took these Things with me , and had this Wastcoat made , and wore them publickly , which I should not have done , if I had had any suspicion of their being stolen . My Sister asked me for a Bit to make her a Petticoat , I bid her take some , but not too much . Q . Did not you say you saw some of the Things openly in the House ? ( To Lund ) Lund . Yes , I saw a Piece hang down towards the Window as I was passing along , and it being the House of Loyd that was convicted for stealing his Grace 's Lead , I got leave to search . I asked him in the Presence of Mr. Russel , and the Constable if he had no more of the white Sattin than what we found there , and he declared to us that he bought no more than lined him a Wastcoat ; but afterwards in searching we found these five Breadths , which he owned he gave his Sister . Prisoner . I sent a Piece by a Baker to a Woman at Totteridge , who was going to britch a a Boy . Robert Marshal , Samuel Tayler , Silas Axtell , John Carpenter and Elizabeth Chasely , spoke to the Prisoner 's Character ; some of these had known him from a Child , and all declared they took him to be a very honest Man . Prisoner . There is my Master Snow can speak to my Behaviour in his Service . Mr . Snow . The Prisoner came recommended to my chief Gardener from the Duke of Chandos : Mr . Hear likewise gave him a good Character . He has work 'd in my Gardens three Years , has always behaved very modestly , and appears to be a laborious , honest , useful , diligent Fellow ; he has had great Opportunities of being dishonest ; I have Ponds of Fish , a great deal of Fruit , and he has had frequent Access to the House ; when I have been in Town , he has lain in the Laundry , full of Cloaths , for the security of the House , yet I never lost any thing . I can not think he stole these Things , because he has worn them publickly in my service ; if he had stole them , surely he would have sold them or dy 'd them . I think him a very honest Fellow , and useful to the Publick . If your Lordship , and the Jury shall think otherwise , I hope he may be recommended to her Majesty 's Favour . Marshal . I have seen him wear the Wastcoat publickly to and from the Duke 's House . Russell . I have seen him wear a handsome red Wastcoat , which I thought he might have bought in Monmouth Street ; I believe it is the same that is here I can not say I ever heard of his dishonesty before this Affair . Lund . He might have worn all these Things , and none but my self , and one Footman more could know them . Acquitted . 4. Samuel Morgan , was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Pullvash , in a certain open Field near the King 's Highway , putting her in fear , and taking from her a Holland Gown value 8 s. a pair of Stays value 3 s. a callamanco quilted Coat value 17 s. a Bermudus Ha : value 7 s. a a cambrick Mob value 2 s. 6 d. a dimity Petticoat value 3 s. a flannel Petticoat value 1 s. and pair of damask Shoes value 2 s 6 d. a pair of silver Buckles value 7 s a gold Ring value 8 s. a a cambrick Handkerchief value 2 s. 6 d. a muslin ditto value 1 s. a linnen Apron value 1 s. and 9 d. half penny in Money . August 1 . Elizabeth Pullvash On Tuesday Night , I can not possible tell the Day of the Month , but it was towards the two last Days of Tottenham Court Fair , the Prisoner met me coming from Tottenham Court , in the middle of the Road near the Town , there were two more with him , he had a Dagger in his Hand , and they had Pistols , They took hold of me , and said , if I cried out I should die . I begged hard for my Life , but they led me out of the Way , and stripped me stark naked . They seized another young Man ( whom I never saw before in my Life ) at the same time . They kept me at some distance from the other Man , and that Man at the Bar stripped me naked , and left me naked , all but my Shift , then he bound me and did what he pleased with me ; he tried to lie with me , and he did all that was in his Power . After he had done every thing he pleased , he took hold of one of my Legs and bound it behind me , and cut my Pocket and stuffed it into my Mouth . I down 'd on my knees , and begged of him to spare my Life ; I told him I was with Child to make him more favourable to me ; he took my Gown , my Stays , a quilted Coat , my Hat , a laced Mob , a flannel Coat , a dimity Coat , my Shoes , a gold Ring , an Apron , and nine Pence Half penny in Money - all I had in the World ; they left me nothing on but my Stockings and Shift and one Petticoat . One of the Men snapped a Pistol twice at my Breast , but it did not go off , the Prisoner was the most resolute , wickedest Fellow of them all ; for he was so long about me doing what he did , that I knew him again ; they kept me 'till 12 o'Clock , doing one thing or another to me . The other Man they robbed at some distance from me , and told him if he looked that way , towards me , he should die ; but when they had done with us both , they tied us with a Cord , and threw us into a Ditch , where we lay up to the Neck in Water and Mud for several Hours . Will Smith . I happened to go over the Field about 4 o'Clock the next Morning , and I thought I heard a Man cry out murder ; I went to see what was the matter , and found the Man and Woman in the Water and Mud . I was up to my middle in getting them out . They were tied Hand and Legs , and this is a piece of the Cord they were bound with . I think she had no Petticoat on , and the Man was quite naked ; their Hands and Legs were tied behind them , and they lay flat upon their Backs in the Water and mud with their Mouths stopp 'd . I cut them loose and this is the Cord that tied the Woman 's Hands . Eliz Field . My Husband was out at work , where this last Witness works , and he came and told me , there was a Woman just lost , in a Ditch ; will you give her leave to be brought up , and put into our Bed says he , if you will no , she must die with being so long in Mud and Water . I consented , and with much ado , we got her to Bed , but I thought she would have died after that . I live at the Brill . between Pancrass and Tottenham-Court : My Husband is sick , and I come here in his behalf . Q . What Day was it this happened ? Field . It was on a Wednesday Morning . between 5 and 6 o'Clock in the Morning , that she was brought to my Lodging . Prisoner . I never was at Tottenham-Court in my Life I was at home at Work when this Fact was committed , but happening to have a Quarrel , I was carried to New Prison , and this Woman was brought there by 3 or 4 Fellows who make it their business to swear People 's Lives away , and they carried me before Justice Midford and then to Mr Barns 's , and I was to give him a Note of Hand , and be discharged , but this Woman came violently up Stairs and rushed into the Room , and said I was the Man that robbed and ravish 'd her , so they sent me to Newgate . Q . Have you any Witnesses , either with regard to the Fact you are charged with , or to your Character ? Prisoner . They have been here , but they are gone . Guilty Death . 5 , 6 , 7. Robert Page , William Orman Rod and Thomas Putrode , were indicted , for that they being Persons of evil Minds and Dispositions , with divers other Disturbers of the Peace , armed with Clubs , Sticks , Stones , & c. and unlawfully devising and contriving , to vex , molest and injure one Graves Atkin , on the 30th of July , about a 11 at Night . before the house of the said Graves Atkin , in Lemon Street , in the Parish of St. Mary Whitechappel , did unlawfully and riotously gather and assemble , with divers others unknown , to the number of one hundred Persons and upwards , and the said Graves Atkin 's Wife and Family being then in the said House , and being so assembled as aforesaid , they , the said Robert Page , William Orman Rod , and Thomas Putrode , the said dwelling House , unlawfully , riotously and violently did attack and with divers other Persons unknown , the Windows and Window Shutters of the said House , with Clubs , Sticks , Stones , & c. did break to pieces and destroy ; by reason and means whereof the said Graves Atkin 's Wife and Family were greatly affrighted , and put in fear and danger of their Lives , and in apprehension of receiving great Hurt , Damage , and injury ; and the said Graves Atkin was obliged , in order to avoid the Rage and Fury of the said Page . Orman Rod , and Putrode , to absent himself from his House and Family , and Shelter himself in places unknown to the said Page , & c. for the space of one Hour ; and other Mischiefs and Damage bringing on the said Graves Atkin , & c in contempt of the Laws , & c. and with an intent to break the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , being then and there so assembled as aforesaid , they , with divers others unknown , did raise a great Disturbance , and a Riot made , and caused to be made , and for the space of one Hour they , the said Page , & c. & c. then and there did unlawfully continue , hollowing and behaving themselves to the terror of the Subjects of our Lord the King , in contempt of the Laws , and to the evil Example of others in like Cases offending , and against the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , & c. The Counsel for the King having very judiciously opened the Nature of the Offence , and shewn the dangerous Consequence of such Outrages , the Witnesses were called . Richard Burton . On Friday Night , July 30 between 9 and 10 , I was at the End of Red Lion Street , and I saw the Mob coming down Bell Yard , with Sticks and lighted Links . One of them made a sort of a speech directing the rest to go down Church Lane , to the Gentleman and Porter : My Master serving Mr. Allen who keeps the House with Drink , I ran down to inform him that his Sign was mentioned . There was about 50 or 60 of them then , and they had 2 or 3 Links with them . One read from a Paper the Signs of the Gentleman and Porter , the Bull and Butcher , and the Tavern in Well Street I did not hear them make any Declaration what was to be done , but I went directly to Allen 's to inform him they had great Sticks , like Stakes out of Bakers Bavins . While I was standing at Allen 's Door , the Mob came down ; I told them the House had been mine for a Fortnight , and that the Man who kept it before was gone . One of them was called Captain Tom the Barber , and was in a striped Banjan . I would have taken notice of him , but he turned away and would not let me see his Face . I desired him to use me favourably , and told him it was my House . They said they knew I was not Irish by my Tongue , and I should not be hurt . I made them set up Candles in the Windows , and pacify 'd the Mob seemingly well , but a Woman telling them it was a sham , and that I was only the Brewer 's Cooper , the Sticks flew immediately and beat the Candle out of my Hand , as I stood at the Door ; but Justice Phillips coming down , and the Captain with his Soldiers , they took some of them , and the rest made off immediately , and were gone as suddenly , as if a Hole had been ready dug in the bottom of the Street , and they had all dropped into it at once . The Prisoners all declared they never saw this Evidence before . Justice Phillips . On Friday , July 30 , about 10 at Night , some Neighbours came knocking at my Door in a great hurry , and told me the Mob were come out of Spittle Fields , and were pulling down some Houses ; they desired my Assistance , and I told them my Assistance would be of little service , without support ; reading the Proclamation will signify nothing ; if you will go to the Tower , and give my service to the Governor , and desire his Assistance , I will venture my Person . They went , and the Governor , or the commanding Officer , sent 30 Men to my Door , and the Captain told me , they had Orders to go with me , and follow my Directions . I desired him that his Men might march quietly , without beat of Drum , and in the dark , and did not doubt , but with such brave Fellows , we should drive them , tho ' they were a greater Number . When we came to the End of the Street , the Houses were all illuminated , and we heard a great Noise , as if they were knocking the Houses to pieces . I said to Captain Hudson , now Sir , I submit to you ; if you please , command your Men into such a Disposition , as may be most proper for the securing as many of the Mob as we can . There was several hundreds attacking a House ; and just over the way , there was a Baker 's Shop ; I apprehend they broke open this Baker 's Celler , and armed themselves out of the Bavins . The Street was very light , and I could see ( at a distance ) the Mob beating against the Shutters with their Clubs , and could hear the Glass fly : so I said to the Captain , - now let us be upon them at once ; I drew my Sword and ran to the House they were attacking , and , that Prisoner Page , I took him with his Club breaking the Windows : I could not tell whether he might not make use of it upon me , therefore I told him , if you do n't surrender , I 'll run you thro ' . The Soldiers at the word of Command had stretched themselves into a Line , and then enclosed as many of them as they could ; among the rest , the Prisoners ; and the Serjeant seized them . The Prisoner Page I took my self , driving furiously at the Windows ; every Pannel of the Shutters was broke but one , and all the Glass . Some were poking in with their Sticks to clear the inside , ( I suppose ) that they might get in . When the Soldiers had taken some of them Prisoners , the rest ran away , some one way , some another ; those we had taken , were carry 'd to the Watch-House , and that I might be more sure of the Prisoners , I called them over at the Watch-House , and took down their Names ; then we posted 12 Soldiers with their Bayonets on their Muskets round the Watch-House , because we were apprehensive the Mob would rescue the Prisoners . After we had patroled 'till Morning , the Captain and I refresh 'd ourselves at my House , and I ordered something for the Men at my Door . I am positive that the Prisoners were among the Mob , and Page I took myself in the Fact , the rest of them might be as near the House , as 't is from hence to the Leads ( before the Court . ) Capt . Joseph Hudson . On the 30th of July , I was sent for from the Tower , by a Message from Justice Phillips : The Governor ordered between 30 or 40 Men to suppress the Assembly , under the Directions of Mr. Phillips . I went with my Men to his House ; he came out with us , and in our way to the place where the Riot was , we called upon another Magistrate . When we came to Lemon Street , we found a vast Number of People assembled together , and I believe there was about 8 or 10 of them were beating with Clubs against the front of the House of one Aikin : I can not say I heard any particular cries ; the Prisoner Page I am positive was one , but I can not be so sure , with regard to either of the other . As they were beating against the front of the House , Mr. Phillips and I , at the front of our Men , with our Swords drawn , struck at one or two of them , and two or three of those who were attacking the House we seized immediately . Mr. Phillips and I were close to one another , and when we had struck among them , our Men instantly follow 'd ; I can not be positive to the Faces of any but Page , tho ' we made 8 or 9 Prisoners in the Watch House . I went with Mr. Phillips to the Watch House , but I ca n't take upon Me to say positively the other Prisoners are the Men . After this , we went and clear 'd the Street , and left a Corporal and 10 or 12 Men to guard the Watch House till the next Morning . Andrew Oakes I went with my Captain , July 30 at Night to Lemon street , from the Tower : We march 'd softly . and in the dark : When we got there , we found the Mob beating against the Windows of the House , the Man 's Name that keeps it , I can not remember , nor can I swear to the Faces of the Men who were attacking it . The Prisoner Orman Rod . I took in the middle of the Street ; he had receiv 'd a Cut from some of the Officer I believe it was from Justice Phillips , but he had nothing in his Hand when I took him , nor did I see him do any thing . He told me he was a Blacksmith , and desired me to let him go ; I told him I could not , so he went along very good humour 'd . I do n't remember I heard any Cries , but I heard the Noise they made with their Sticks against the Window Shutters , and against the Glass . Mr. Phillips . I heard the Hollowing at my House . and the Cry in the Street was , down with the Irish , down with the Irish . Daniel Barnes . I was present in Lemon-street , and I heard the Noise of their beating against the Windows , tho ' I saw but little of the Mischief 'till the Mob had done ; then I saw the Shutters of the Windows were broke to pieces : I was as near as the rest , under the Command , and was going along the middle of the Street . I did see several striking against the Windows . Q . Did you hear any Cries and Noise made ? Barnes . I can not remember particular Persons nor Words : I was indeed at the taking of Orman Rod ; he was cut in the Head , and was then very much disguised with his own Blood . I saw him again after I came to the Tower , but I can not now be sure whether the Prisoner is the same Person . I , and the last Man examined , brought him to the Watch House , and Mr. Justice Phillips was there when we delivered him in , and he saw him and all the rest of the Men that we took Prisoners , but I can not swear to their Faces . I remember I took Orman Rod out of the Mob , and that either my Captain or Mr. Phillips cut him over the Head : he was within 4 or 5 Yards of the Door , but I did not see him strike , nor did I see any thing in his Hand ; he desired us to let him go , and we told him we could not . He endeavoured to run away when the Captain and Mr. Phillips came upon him , but we layed hold of him and brought him back . Capt . Hudson . I can not charge my Memory with the Man 's Person . Justice Phillips . I saw Barnes seize the Prisoner Orman Rod , but I can not say whether he struck at the Windows or not ; I am positive he is the Man that was taken . This Soldier is unwilling to declare the Truth , because one of the Prisoner 's is a Brother Soldier William Fairclough I was under the Command of Capt . Hudson at that time ; we went from the Tower to Mr. Phillips 's House , from thence to the End of Lemon Street . I heard no Cry , but there was about 40 or 50 People in the Mob . Q . Did you hear no Cry at all ? Fairclough . Only down with them - down with them , this was all I heard . They had Clubs in their Hands , and were demolishing the Windows , I seized the Prisoner Putrode , he was with them who were crying down with them - down with them , about half a dozen Yards from the House , and had a Stick in his Hand about the length of a common Walking-stick ; but when I seized him , he dropped it , and begged for God 's sake I would let him go . I told him I did not come for that End from the Tower ; if my Captain and the Justice will let you go they may . We carried this Man to the Watch House , and Mr. Phillips , and Capt Hudson , and Capt , Littleer were there . Q . Where did you take this Man ? Fairclough . Between the End of Lemon Street and White Lyon Street . Q . Did you suppose he dropped his Stick by Design ? Fairlough . He seemed surprised at my seizing him as I did . Justice Phillipss I saw Putrode seized by that Man ; we ran upon them , and I cried out seize them , seize them ; I laid hold of Page ; and the Soldiers seiz 'd Putrode . Graves Aikin . I live in Lemon Street ; July 30 , at Night , I was at a Neighbour 's House ; my Child came to me about 10 o'Clock , and told me there was a great Mob gone by . I went home , and a Lodger told me the great Cry was , put up your Lights . I imagined this was to distinguish Houses , so I sent for Candles and li't them up . Sometime after this , I heard they were coming back to my House ; my Wife was very much frighted , and begged me to get out . I told her I would stay , but she insisting upon my leaving the House , I went out , and heard the Mob at Mr. Allens ; I went thither , and heard them cry , Down with the Irish - down with the Irish ; I saw them breaking Allen 's Windows , and raking in the Kennel , I suppose for Stones , but I can not say I saw them take any up . Then I heard them enquire for my House , a Woman directed them to it , and they fell immediately upon it . I believe there might be above a hundred People ; they broke my Windows and Shutters with their great Clubs , but Capt . Hudson and Justice Phillips came in a very little time to my relief , and I was afraid to get in among them , lest some body should shew me to the Mob , as they had done my House . Page 's Defence , My Sister being at my Fathers that Night , I went to see her home ; we met the Mob , and while I stood looking on I was taken hold of . Alice Corner . I know nothing of this matter , nor where he was that Night ; but I have known him from a Child , and never heard or saw any harm of him . - Brown . I saw Page that Night standing in Mill Yard looking on ; there was a great Noise , and I said , Bob , what do you do here ? he told me he was going home presently ; this was a quarter past 11 at Night , and in a quarter of an Hour afterwards , I heard he was taken up . I have known him from a Child , he is a very honest Lad as ever I knew in my Days . Mary Hutton , gave the Prisoner a good Character . Orman Rod 's Defence . I was at work that Night at Rotherhith 'till 8 o'Clock ; then I went to Horse-lye-down , and came home to supper ; but hearing the Soldiers were come , I went out to see the Sight , and was taken . I live in Rag Fair the Corner of Church Lane . John Grice , and another Witness appear 'd to this Prisoner 's Character ; but as they had both been Bail , for his Appearance at this Sessions , their Evidence was not taken . Leonard Kell , Richard Dobbins , Thomas Herring , Roger Whityate , and others appear 'd , and gave this Prisoner a good Character . Thomas Putrode 's Defence My Wife deals in Rag Fair , and sells old Cloaths : She was not at home that Night , I went out to see for her ; the Mob came past me , and the Soldiers took me . John Lewis , Michael Seawell , and Ann Bradford , gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest quiet Man . The Jury found them all Guilty . Robert Page , was a second Time indicted , for that he , on the 30th of July , with divers other Malefactors , to the Number of one hundred Persons , arm 'd with Clubs , Sticks , & c. the House of James Farrel , in Rose and Crown Alley , did assault , and several of the Glass Windows , and Shutters belonging to the said Windows , did break and destroy , the said James Farrel , and his Family being in the House ; by reason of which the said Farrel for the preservation of his Life , was oblig 'd to absent himself from his Family for the space of an Hour And for that he , the said Robert Page , a certain piece of Board did cast and throw into the said House , which struck Catherine , the Wife of James Farrel , on the left Thigh , to the great Damage of the said James Farrel and Catherine his Wife , and to the evil Example of others offending , & c. James Farrel . I live in Rose and Crown Alley in Church Lane . On the 30th of July I was at home ; my Wife was gone to bed with my Godchild , and I was undrest and in my Shirt when the Noise came down the Alley . I open 'd my Window and look 'd out , and heard them knocking at the next House . Hall and Kelly cry 'd out , d - n ye that is not the House , and then they came to my House ; I had a Candle in my Hand , and saw that Page and Kelley were the first that attack 'd my Windows with their Clubs : Kelly 's Wife open 'd her Door , gave them a Candle , and cry 'd d - n them , have their Heart 's Blood . I was at the Window with a Candle in my Hand , and saw the Prisoner break my Windows , and the middle Pannel of the Door . When the Door was broke , I thought it high time to get away ; so I open 'd a back Casement , and got out in my Shirt from the first Story . I said to my Wife , you ca n't get out , you must be at their Mercy . I had no sooner spoke , but a Board was thrown in , which hit her on the Thigh , I jump 'd out of the Window into the Hog Yard , and heard the Mob crying d - n it , which are Irish Houses ? A Farrier let me thro ' the Yard , and I went down in my Shirt towards Sullivan 's : Fearing I should be known , I came back to the Farrier 's , and got to my back Window , and my Wife threw me out something to cover me . While Page was beating against the House , I heard him cry out , d - n it , - more Help , more Help ; and they did not leave me one whole Pane of Glass in my Windows , tho ' I call 'd out to Page - pray young Man forbear , - I ask your Pardon - I do n't hurt any Body . Guilty . [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour . See summary . ] 8 , 9. Robert Mickey , and Joshua Hall , were indicted , for that they with divers other Persons to the Number of one hundred , the dwelling House of John Waldon , scituate and being in Cable Street , with Sticks , Clubs , & c. did assault , and the Windows and Shutters of the said House did break in Pieces and destroy , & c. July 30 . Joshua Hall , was a second time indicted , for breaking ( as aforesaid ) the House of James Wharfington , July 30 . John Waldon . I keep the Bull and Butcher in Cable Street , and have a great Number of Country Shopkeepers lodge in my House when they come to Town ; we have some 60 or 70 People in the House , but then we had but 18 . The 30th of July , every one in the House was gone to bed but my self , and I was stripped all but my Stockings and Breeches ; but hearing the Mob come down , and crying , down with the Irish , and seeing all the Houses illuminated , I bid all my Lodgers get up and shift for their Lives : I got over a Wall 8 Feet high , and some of the Neighbours helped the Lodgers off . I left the House to their Mercy , ( for my Wife was out at a Woman 's Labour ) and they stole and broke every Thing I had . I staid in the House , 'till the Shutters and Glass all flew in together . They did not enter the House , but they reached in with their Arms , and took Meat out of the Windows . Six of my Shutters were broke , and 70 odd Panes of Glass , which Damage cost me 3 l. 13 s. to repair . I ca n't say I saw any of them . Mary Conelly . I livs about 20 or 30 Yards from this Man 's House ; and the Night this Disturbance happened , somebody came and told my Mother the Mob was coming , and that her Name ( Ann Austin ) was mention 'd . They order 'd the English People to put out Lights , and the Cry was , down with the Irish . I saw Mickey and several others beating against Waldon 's House . I went out among the Mob , but shifted from one Place to another , lest they should know me . When the Soldiers came , they threw away their Sticks , andran away , and Mickey followed them after his Stick was gone . Hall I ca n't say I remember , but I got Mickey secur 'd that Night . I went next Morning to see him in the Tower , and he cry 'd to me d - n ye , what are you upon . John Bivin a Serjeant . The Prisoner Mickey I seiz 'd at this Woman 's Request ; somebody said , this is one of the Rioters , and I laid hold of him I ca n't say I saw him do any thing , or that he had any Thing in his Hand . - Potter . July the 30th , I saw a great Number of People breaking Waldon 's House ; among the rest I saw Hall in a red ( I believe it was his Regimental ) Wastcoat , he hollow 'd out down with the Irish , but I did not see him do any thing I met him afterwards , and asked him , if he was not ashamed , he being a Soldier , to be guilty of such Things ? Hush , hush , said he , for God 's sake hold your Tongue . I saw him at some Distance from Walden 's House , hollowing , while others were breaking the Windows ; I heard them call out for the English to put out Lights , and saw them hand Meat out of the Window . Ann Bell . I have known Hall a good while ; the Night this Riot happened I saw him going before the Mob ; when they had broke Waldon 's House , they went to the Windmill , then they came back to Mrs. Austin 's , and broke that , and Hall was with them , crying down with the Irish Mickey 's Defence . After I had done work that Night , I call 'd upon my Master ( who sells a Dram ) and I had part of a Quartern of Gin , then I went to the Queen 's Head in Rag Fair and had a Full Pot of Beer ; going home I met an old Master of mine , who is a Headborough , at the End of Church Lane , and he charged me to assist him ; I went to the Watch House , and was seized by the Soldiers . Conolly when she came to the Tower , said , she could swear against a Brewer 's Servant , and took him for me . - Abbot , gave the Prisoner a good Character , and said , Conolly 's was but very indifferent . Mosely ( Headhorough . ) I was called up at that time to assist my Neighbours , and followed the Mob to the Bull and Butcher ; at the End of Church Lane , I met Mickey , and charged him to assist me . He went up White Lyon Street with me , where the Mob were beating down another House ; I lost him in the Croud , and found afterwards that he was taken up . I have known him some Years . - Adams . Mickey lived in my House , and the Night that this happened he stood at my Door while the Mob was beating down some Houses in Church Lane , where I live , I miss 'd him , and went down to see them , at the Bull and Butcher ; I did not see him there , but in half an Hour after I heard he was seiz 'd . I told him before he went , he would go and look on , and get himself taken up . - Lyddal . I saw Mickey standing by the Watch House , and says he , what pity it is they take up the English ? they ought to take up the Irish ; a Soldier said , he was one of them , and shoved him into the Watch House . Hall 's Defence . I worked at Mr. Sharp 's , a Sawyer and Lath render ; as I came home from work I staid half an Hour , as others did , to look on ; the People that swore I had a Club in my Hand are mistaken . 'T is common for Lath-renders to bring home a Bit of a Chip or a Lath in their Hands . Mary Abbot . I saw the Mob go one way and Hall was going another : I heard him say to a young Woman that was shutting up her Windows , do not be frighted , and he helped her to shut them up Justice Phillips . I was by when Mickey was taken , the Girl said she had marked him , and followed him , and that he was never out of her sight , I was with the Soldier that took him , and the Girl did charge the Soldier with him ; she gave the same Account , that she has now done , when she was examined before me , and Colonel Williamson .

She made a Noise , and up came 2 Men , and then she scolded and called me Names ; I collar 'd one , but he got from me , and they both ran away . Then I carried her up Market Hill , and at the White Lyon Tavern Back Door , she said she wanted to tie her Garter , and there I suppose she dropped my Watch , for there it was found the next Morning .

What 's that to you , says I , do n't be so sulky , says he . I told him if he went on , he 'd meet somebody to his Mind : but going along we came to an Alehouse , where there were Curtains to the Windows , so he made me drink part of a Pint there . When we came out , he haul 'd me down Sun Tavern Fields , I asked him what he was going to do ; and being a'lone Woman he haul 'd me cross the Kennel , and got me down on the Steps , and said , d - n ye , if you squal I 'll give you a good Knock : After this we went to Shadwell Market , and there he wanted to have me again upon the Stalls ; he did pull up my Petticoats quite over my Head , but 2 Men coming up , God bless you , says I to them , for coming , and then he charged me with taking his Watch .

John Lyon , was indicted , for that whereas Edward Bonner , was convicted of a Robbery on the Highway by him committed July 23 , he the said Lyon did falsely and maliciously depose and swear , that the said Bonner was at the Greyhound Inn in Smithfield from eleven to three of the same Day ; whereas in Truth and in Fact , the said Bonner was not there , not at any Place commonly so call 'd from eleven to three on that Day . The Counsel for the King having opened the Charge , and the Record of Bonner 's Conviction being read , the Witnesses were called . Mr. Hasswell . The 23d of July last , I was going in a Chariot to Southgate , and a little on this side Tottenham , the Coachman turned down the Green Lane . In this Lane 2 Men came up , one on one side , and the other on the other side of the Chariot and robbed me , between 1 and 2 o'Clock . Bonner was convicted here for this Robbery last Sessions . I did not swear positively to the Man : it was proved upon him by other Evidence . 'n behalf of Bonner there appeared at the Trial Abraham and Susannah Wells , Story , who is since dead in Newgate , and John Lyon the Prisoner at the Bar . He is the Man who swore on that Trial that he met Bonner the 23d of July in Smithfield ; that he went with him to the Grey hound Inn , that they were together from eleven to three in the Afternoon ; that he wrote a Receipt for Money paid by Wells to one Foiler a Grazier in Essex Lyon . I only desire you to take notice he does not swear to Bonner . The Constable . Bonner was tried here last Sessions , and he produced the Prisoner Lyon , who was sworn in Court , he deposed that he was with Bonner from 11 to 3 , and wrote a Receipt for Money which Wells paid to one Foiler , and was never out of his Company all that time . Philip Wilson . My Master was travelling to Southgate , the 2 d. of July ; I turn 'd out of the Road on this side the High-Cross . into the Green Lane and saw 2 Men hollow to one another . I turn 'd back and saw Bonner and Cocky Wager following the Chariot . I saw them both very plain . before they mask 'd themselves : I did not expect a Robbery , 'till I saw one of them mask himself ; and I am sure the Man who was try 'd here last Sessions , was one of them that robb 'd my Master between 1 and 2 o'Clock . The Prisoner Lyon swore on that Trial , that he was in Bonner 's Company from 11 to 3 the 23d . of July , at the Greyhound Inn , and that he wrote a Receipt for Money then paid . Lyon . Ask the Coachman what he said , when Bonner was carry 'd before Sir Richard Brocas . Wilson . I said I would inform my self a little more , before I would swear to him , I had a Mind to inform my self a little better , and on that Information I was sure he was the same Person . Lyon . He only swore to his Speech , before Sir Richard Brocas , and had he not had an ill Character of Bonner , he would not have swore against him . Council . Now we will shew the Assignment of the Perjury ; and that he was not at the Greyhound Inn , that Day . John Broughton . I keep the Greyhound Inn . I did not know Bonner , nor did I see him there that Day . The Prisoner I do n't remember I ever saw in my Life 'till last Sessions . I did not go into the several Rooms , for I was at the Book , taking Money for the Grazier 's all Day . I go out at Dinner sometimes , but I did not see any of them . Council . Is there not a Register kept of the Cows , & c. that are sold in your Market ? Broughton . Yes , I set them down , and there was no such Beast paid for that Day , nor was Bonner any Customer of mine . Theophilus Joiner . I knew Mr Bonner , and I was all Day July the 23d at the Greyhound Inn , but I can not recollect that he was there at all . I was at my Books all that Day ; for I am concerned for several Persons who sell Goods in the Field , and I take their Money . I was in the Front of the House , on the right Hand , going in at the Door . I never saw the Defendant Lyon in my Life . 'T is a large Inn , but most of the Rooms were taken up : Bonner might be there , but I did not see him there all that Day . Council . We prove by Wilson that he was the Man who robb 'd Mr. Hasswell , and we say Foiler is a fictitious Name ; if what we say is not true , it lies on him to produce this Foiler . We can go no farther than Negative Proof , if he can produce a Person to make out the Affirmative , we must submit . Guilty . [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour . See summary . ] 33 Abraham Wells was indicted for wilful and corrupt Perjury , in swearing that on the 23d . of July , he bought a Bullock in Smithfield of one Foiler , and that afterwards in the said Inn , he paid the said Foiler 10 l. which he ow 'd him , and was in company with Edward Bonner at the said Inn , from 11 o'Clock to 4 or 5 in the Afternoon : Whereas in Truth and in Fact , the said Bonner was not at the Greyhound Inn from 11 to 4 or 5 . & c. The Constable . The Prisoner at the Bar appear 'd here last Sessions on Mr. Bonner 's Behalf , and swore he was in Company with him ( Bonner from 11 o'Clock 'till 4 or 5 in the Afternoon : That he bought a Bullock in Smithfield of one Foiler , and paid him ; 10 s. for it , and 20 l of an old Debt , and that Bonner was in Company with him all that Time . I have been with the Prisoner since he has been in Newgate , and said to him , may be your Affairs may be distress 'd , and you may want Money ; if you will give me an Account , where this Foiler lives , I will enquire for him : He told me I need not trouble my self , for he was dead . Mr. Hasswell gave the same Account of the Robbery , as in the former Trials , and then proceeded in his Evidence against the Prisoner . Mr. Hasswell . The Prisoner appeared on Bonner 's Trial , and swore that he came to Smithfield on the 23d of July ; that he bought a Bullock and paid for it , and went into the Grey Hound Inn with Bonner and Foiler ; that Lyon wrote a Receipt for the Money paid , and that Bonner was with him from eleven to four or five in the Afternoon . Philip Wilson , deposed to the same Effect . John Broughton , in answer to a Question , whether it was not customary for Persons to go up Stairs in his House , deposed , that they never let any Persons go up unless they know them ; except when the Horse Market begins , which is about three o'Clock in the Afternoon ; that he verily believed if he had had such a Company in his House , who staid so long , he must have seen them . Prisoner . There are many Bullocks sold in Smithfield that are never book 'd : I bought two fat Cows , and drove them home directly . Guilty . [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour . See summary . ] 34. Susan Wells , was indicted for that she , as a Witness for Edward Bonner , did swear she was at the Grey Hound Inn in Smithfield with her Husband , and that the said Bonner was in their Company from eleven to four or five . - & c The Evidence was the same as above . Guilty . [ Imprisonment . See summary . ] 35. Philip Chapman , was indicted for willful and corrupt Perjury , in swearing at Guild Hall , February 14 , 1733 . that John Tyson on the 25th of December 1722 , was at his House in the Tower of London , and that he ordered himself to be denied to one Myat a Taylor , to whom he was indebted in the Sum of 25 l. - or there abouts ; whereas in Truth and in Fact , the said Tyson was not at his House in the Tower , but was on the 25th of December 1722 , at his Seat , called Woolvaston Hall in Suffolk - & c. George Rignal Chadwick I was at that time Clerk to Mr. Goostrey , and I remember the Prisoner was called as a Witness of Collet and Brown , Assignees of Mr. Tyson ; he swore that on the 25 of December 1722 , Mr. Tyson ordered himself to be denied , and that he was denied to one Myat a Taylor , and that he was indebted at that time in the Sum of 25 l. or there abouts to the said Myat . I remember there was none of the Witnesses fixed the time but the Prisoner . Thomas Willmore . I was present at this Trial in Hillary Term , between the Assignees of Mr. Tyson , and those of Mr. Ward , and I heard Chapman swear that John Tyson on the 25th of December was at his House in the Tower of London at nine o'Clock in the Morning ; that he ordered himself to be denied to one Myat a Taylor , who came to dun him for Money . This Trial was on the 23d of January , I think , I am not sure . - Metcalf . This Trial was at Guild Hall , February 23d , 1733 . The Prisoner was sworn and examined for Collet and Brown ; he swore Mr. Tyson ordered himself to be denied the 25th of December 1722 , to Myat a Taylor , and that he was then at his House in the Tower , and owed Myat 25 l. - Thomas Parsons . I was in the Year 1722 Servant to Mr. Tyson ; on Christmass Eve he came down to Woolvaston Hall in Suffolk , and Christmass Day several Farmers dined with him , and on the next Day he went out a hunting ; and I remember Sir Casar Child was there that Christmass ; Lady Child went down before , but her Coach broke down on the Road , and Mr. Tyson when he came , took her into his Coach , and brought her to Woolvaston Hall . Sir Caesar Child I believe might be there the Day before . Last February I happened to see Chapman and we fell into Discourse about this Affair , and he told me he believed he was wrong in what he swore at the Trial at Guild Hall . Richard Wood . I remember Mr. Tyson was at Woolvaston Hall the 25th of December 1722 , because on that Day he gave out Bread and Beef , and no such thing was done before , or has been done since . I am sure he never was in the Country but that Christmass , nor no Man else . Thomas Death . Fourteen Years ago next Christmass Eve , I carried some of Mr. Tyson 's People and their Goods to Woolvaston Hall , that very Night that he went himself , there were two Coaches together and one of them broke down , so they revoked that Coach and got into the other , and I carried the Luggage and Servants in my Waggon . Joseph Burges . The Day after Christmass Day 1722 , I met Mr. Tyson going a hunting , and I never remembered him keep Christmass there but that time , - Harrison . I live at the King 's Head at Colchester ; I knew Tyson very well , he was at my House the 22d and 23d of December ( I have forgot the Year ) and he went away the 24th to Woolvaston Hall , but my Bill has never been paid yet . Prisoner 's Defence . Sir Cesar Child I was at this Tryal at Guildhall , and remember Chapman 's being a Witness there : He swore it was Christmas 1722 . I never heard either Christmas Day , or the twenty fifth of December mention 'd ; but only Christmass 22 . I know Mr. Tyson did abscond , and did commit Acts of Bankruptcy : I have heard him order Chapman to deny him to his Creditors , many Times before this Christmass , and several Times before my Face . I have been at his House when People have enquired for him , and he has deny 'd him ; and I have gone through them all , and found him above Stairs . I know he did not care to trust any body to deny him , but Chapman . As to Myat 's Name , which they have sworn to , I do n't remember I heard it once mention 'd : There was Hopegood and How I think I remember mention 'd upon the Tryal . I have known Chapman from a Boy , he was always a very honest just Servant ; he liv 'd with Captain Cleland , and since that he has been a Tenant under me , and I believe he would no more forswear himself , than I would Mr. Cotton . I was at the Tryal , and remember what Chapman swore ; it was , about Christmass 1722 he had such Orders from Tyson . I do n't remember Myat 's Name was ever mention 'd . I had a List of Tyson 's Creditors , and I think there was no such Name among them . Mr. How . I know Mr. Tyson , - I have reason to know him , he owes me 95 l. upon Bond . About Christmass 22 , I was many Times to see after my Money Chapman used to deny him , but I have staid after that , and have seen him go out in Disguise . Mr. Linton . I was at Tyson 's at Christmass , 1722 , for Money , Chapman has deny 'd him , and I have afterwards seen him go out . Mr. Wilkinson . Mr. Chapman on the Trial mention 'd no particular Day . he only said about Christmass 1722 . I believe him to be as honest a Man as lives , and that he would not forswear himself for the Universe . Mr. Fleming . I went down that very Christmass to Woolvaston Hall with Mr. Tyson ; I can not be sure whether it was Christmas Day or the Day after ; but it could not be before Christmass , because I remember all the Shops were shut up . I waited two Hours at the Man in the Moon at White-chappel for him : At last he came , in a mighty Hurry , We whipt into a higher Chariot , and away we went , no Creature with us . I have known Chapman sixteen Years , an honest Man , and do n't believe he 'd forswear himself . Sir Caesar Child : Mr. Tyson that Christmass was to have call 'd upon us , at Woodford Bridge , and we were all to have gone into Suffolk together ; but he sent us Word we must set out before him , and he would meet us at the King 's Head at Colchester , but he did not come , and we went down to Woolvaston , and Tyson came down a Day or two after , and this Gentleman was with him . Acquitted . 36. John Smart , was indicted for marrying Thamar Trantum , August the 29th last , his former Wife Elizabeth Coax , being then living . Thamar Trantum . I only desire to be clear 'd of him , I never bedded with him , and have nothing to do with him . His first Wife own 'd she was marry 'd to him ; and took her Oath of it before the Justice . Another Witness . I was at Thamar Trantam 's Wedding with the Prisoner Smart . She was marry 'd to him the twenty ninth of August . I never saw the first Wife 'till Yesterday ; and then she was carried away from us by Force . Q . Have you brought the Parson that marry 'd them ? Witness . No But I will go and see if I can get him , his Name is Gainham , a Fleet Parson . Dr. Gainham . They have a Certificate of this Marriage , but it is none of mine : Mrs. Ball gave it them , but I marry 'd them . Q . Do you remember the Prisoner and this Woman ? Gainham I do n't remember Faces , 't is impossible , quite impossible I should remember Faces . I know I married two People by those Names . Q. do you know the Prisoner ? Gainham . I do n't remember his Face ; but here is my Register . Q . What Register is that ? Gainham . 'T is my Register ; a Register of all the People I marry ; and as fair a Register as any in England , of all the People that are married by me . Q . Is it a Parish Register ? Gainham . No , 't is my own private Register . Q . What , do you keep a private Register ; where do you live ? Gainham . In St. Bride 's Parish . Q . And where do you marry People ? Gainham . In several Houses . Q . And not in the Church ? Gainham . No . Q . Have you Licences when you marry ? Gainham . No . Q . And are you not ashamed to scandalize your Character ? Gainham . I do not chuse it ; but I am old , and infirm , and am not able to get any Preferment . Q . And will you commit Crimes because you can not get Preferment ? Does your Conscience teach you that ? Gainham . I do not chuse it , my Lord - but - Q . Do you know any thing about John Smart ? Gainham . ( Reading ) On the fifteenth of May , one thousand seven hundred and thirty three , I married John Smart , Drummer of the first Regiment of Foot Guards , to Elizabeth Colt , Spinster . Q . And do you always marry People by their right Names ? Gainham . Yes , by their true Names . They always give me their Names ; and if they go and take out Licences , they tell their Names themselves . Q . Do not you know you act contrary to the Canons of the Church ? Do you know whether the Prisoner is the Man you married ? Gainham . No , on my Oath , I can not remember . Mrs. Ball who gave the Certificate , was present at the Marriage , but she would not come . Q . The Name being in the Book is no Evidence , if you do n't know the Man . Gainham . I have no Remembrance of the Person . Acquitted . The Grand Jury represented to the Court , that Gainham was a Scandal to his Function ; and requested that some Method might be taken to suppress his iniquitous Proceedings . 37. John Powel , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of Henry Hall and Cranley Thomas Kirby , in the Night Time , and stealing thence 140 Pounds weight of cut Tobacco , value seven Pounds , the Goods of Henry Hall , and Cranley Thomas Kirby , October the 3d . Mr. Kirby . The Morning after our House was broke , which was Sunday Morning between eight and nine , a Servant came to my Chamber , and told me my Cellar Door was broke open , and the Cellar had been robb 'd . I went down , and found the Plank of the Cellar Window had been forced open , under my dwelling House . I went down to see what I had lost ; and I miss 'd about a hundred and twenty Pounds of cut Tobacco ; and there was a Train of Tobacco from the Place whence it was taken to the uppermost Stair . I was inform 'd that some Tobacco of the same Cut had been spill 'd in Old-bedlam : I follow 'd the Train , and found it was Tobacco of the same Cut , with that I had lost . I did not care to make an Alarm ; but in the dusk of the Evening I went to the Beadle , and asked how many Turnings or Passages there were out of Old Bedlam ? He told me there were but Four . I desired him to get me four Watchmen ; and these four Watchmen I planted , one at every Passage : And in about half an Hour after they were set , the Prisoner was taken with a Bag of Tobacco on his Back . I live in Bishop 's Gate-street , and a Watchman stands within three Doors of this Cellar . Edward Bagshaw , Beadle . On Sunday after Church was done , Mr. Kirby sent for me , and desired me to get him four or five Watchmen ; I told him I could not tell whether I could or not . But about six he came to me and I got him four Watchmen , and supplanted them in Old Bedlam ; one at every Turning ; none could pass but they must see them . This was half an Hour after eight , and in half an Hour , or three quarters after they were set , this Fellow came by with a Bag upon his Back ; one of the Watchmen let him pass , 'till he came pretty near to another , then they took him , and sent for me ; I brought the Constable with me , and the Prisoner is the same Man , that was then taken with the Goods upon him . James Thompson . I am a Watchman : I seiz 'd him with the Bag of Tobacco upon his Back . I asked him where he was going with it ? He said at first to Billings-gate , then to Petticoat-Lane . He told us he was hired to carry it . He had three quarters of a Hundred all but two Pounds upon his Back , when I laid hold of him , it was in a Canvas Bag ; I did not know whose it was , but I found it upon him : He was coming out of Moorfields , through Old Bedlam Gate , and I made him pitch it upon a Bulk in Old Bedlam There were two Men with him , and one of them carried the Prisoner 's Hat , but when we seiz 'd him they ran away , and he call 'd out , Will , Will , after one of them . Prisoner . Ask him if he has seen me in his Watch sculking about at any time ? Thompson . No , I ca n't say I have . Israel Irish . I was planted by Mr. Kirkby 's Order in Old Bedlam , and between eight and nine on Sunday Night we took that Man at the Bar with the Tobacco on his Back : we asked him where he was going with it , and at first he said he was going to the Water-Side , and afterwards he told us he was to carry it to Petticoat Lane . When Mr. Kirkby had opened the Bag , he asked him , if he could take upon him to swear the Tobacco was his . Prisoner . Ask that Watchman if he ever saw me in his Beat ? Irish . I can not say I ever saw him until I took him with the Goods upon his Back . William Wild . On Sunday the third of October I was sent for to Mr. Kirly 's House about this Tobacco , after the Prisoner was taken . We asked him how he came by it ; he gave us but a very slender Account of the Matter ; he had very little to say ; all we could get from him , was , that two Men met him , and gave him a Shilling to carry it for them to St. Catherine 's ; but he said afterwards he was to carry it to Petticoat Lane ; he was in two or three Stories about it . When he was taken , there were two Men with him , and he called out to one of them - Will , Will , take care of my Hat . We judged the Tobacco had been stole , so we secured him in the Compter that Night , and next Morning had him before the Lord Mayor . We had a Warrant after this to search the House of Philip Lacy , a Thief , who keeps a Brandy Shop the lower End of Petticoat Lane , by White Chappel ; we searched the House , and found Philip Lacy , but no Tobacco . Robert Blood . Saturday will be a Fortnight , I made the Cellar fast ; I locked it , and it was secure about six o'Clock in the Evening , when it began to be duskish . Between seven and eight the next Morning I got up , and found the Cellar Window broke open ; it was Sabbath Day Morning , and had been light some time . I acquainted my Master that the Cellar was broke open ; we went down , and found we had lost Tobacco out of a Hogshead , and that it had been spilled in the Cellar , and all up the Stairs . Q . Was the Tobacco you saw on the Prisoner , your Master 's ? Blood . It was exactly the same Cut , and very much like his Tobacco . I did not see it until I came before the Lord Mayor ; and I do not remember that the Prisoner owned then , that the Tobacco that was produced against him was the same that was taken upon him . Thompson again . I took the Tobacco from the Prisoner ; I seized it on his Shoulder , and the Constable shewed it to this last Witness . It was the same Tobacco we found upon him , and the same that was shewed upon Mr. Kirby 's Compter . Q . ( To Blood . ) Do you believe that Tobacco to be your Master 's ? Blood . To the best of my Thoughts , it is . It is the same Cut , and is very much like it ; nothing can be more like it - nothing in the World . We have not brought the Parcel we took on the Prisoner , but we have brought Samples of both , and any body that has any Judgment in the Goods , on comparing them together , will think as I do . I was but the Day before cutting and sifting this very Tobacco , and I do look upon it to be my Master 's . Prisoner 's Defence . On Sunday I went over to Old Street , ( I live in White Chappel , ) about setting up a Pair of Grates , and the People I went to asked me to stay and dine with them ; I staid there until seven or eight of the Clock at Night ; and as I was going over Moor-fields towards where I live , I over took two Men , and they said they would give me a Shilling to carry their Bag to the Water-side , in order to their putting it on board a Ship . They appeared like Sailors , and I , thinking no harm , took it , and one of them carried my Hat ; so going through Bedlam , I was stopped by these Men . Q . Have you any Witnesses ? Prisoner . No ; None at all now . Acquitted . 38 , 39. Richard Curtis and Edward Joice , were indicted for wickedly and maliciously contriving , and conspiring ( with divers others , ) to charge John Drinkwater with a Robbery on the Highway , to the great Damage , & c. of the said John Drinkwater .

Richard Rustead , was indicted , for that he being a Person of an evil and wicked Disposition , and a common Deceiver of his Majesty 's Subjects , on the ninth of October , in the Parish of St. Michael Quern , did defraud Philip Lunkley by false play at Cards , at a certain Game called Cutting the Cards , of the Sum of Three Shillings and Six Pence , the Money of the said Philip Lunkley ; and which Money Richard Rusthead , into his Possession unlawfully did get , to the Damage of the said Lunkley . To this Indictment the Prisoner pleaded not guilty , and declared he should not be ready for Trial until the next Sessions , and desired to traverse his Indictment ; and his Trial was accordingly deferred . 41. Mary ( the Wife of John ) Sommers , was indicted , for that she on the fourteenth Day of February , in the second Year of his Majesty 's Reign , in the Parish of St. Bride 's London , did take to Husband John Sommers , and to him , was then and there married ; and that afterwards , to wit , on the twenty seventh of April , in the second Year of his Majesty 's Reign , she the said Sommers , in the Parish of St. Bennet Paul 's Wharf , feloniously took to Husband , and to him was then and there married , her former Husband being then alive . To this Indictment the Prisoner pleaded not Guilty ; and desired her Trial might be deferr 'd 'till next Sessions , many of her Witnesses being in the Country , and she on that Account unable to make a proper Defence . Which Request was granted by the Court . 42. Grace Powell , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing six pewter Plates , value six Shillings , and an iron Bed-screw , value six Pence , the Goods of Samuel Pate , September the 11th . Samuel Pate . The Prisoner lodged in my House , about a Week ; and while my Wife and I were out , she took that Opportunity to take out Key , and rob us of the Plates and the Bed-screw . They were found upon her . This Woman took the Bed-screw from under her Petticoats . When I saw it , I asked her how she came by it , and she said it was none of mine , I had nothing to do with it : Well says I , how you got the Key of the Door I know not , but I will enquire : Upon this she went down into the Cellar , and two of the Plates dropped from her : I heard them fall , and so I followed her , and found two more dropped down the House of Office . Prisoner . Are not you a vile Man to say you found them upon me ? Martha King . I took the Bed-screw from under her Petticoats , it was thrust under the String that ty 'd them . When we had taken this , she went down Stairs into the Cellar , and dropp 'd two Plates upon the Stairs , I saw her pull two more out of her Bosom , and two more she dropped down the Vault . I saw her pull the Plates out of her Bosom upon the Stairs . Prisoner 's Defence . I was at a stand , being just come out of St. Martin 's Workhouse . That Samuel Pate letts two-penny Lodgings , and entertains Black-shoe-fellows , and sells Drams . I own I had drank three or four Drams , and if I had the Bed-screw , it was unknown to me . How the Plates came there I do not know , I never handled them . That Woman , King , used to be there , and the House used to be full of People , Men and Women , all lie together in the same Room . I happened to say something he did not like - O ye B - h , says he , I will stick upon your Skirts . I have no Friends but God and my self . Acquitted .
