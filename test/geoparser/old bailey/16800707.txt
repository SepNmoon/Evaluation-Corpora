THE NARRATIVE Of the most Material PROCEEDINGS AT THE SESSIONS For LONDON and MIDDLESEX , Begun July the Seventh , 1680 . Giving an Account of the Proceedings against John Giles , for being one of those that made the late barbarous Attempt upon Justice ARNOLD . As also of divers other persons Convicted of several Murders , Robberies on the High-way , Burglaries , and other Felonies ; and all other remarkable Tryals there ; together with the Names and Crimes of all that received Sentence of Death ; the Number of those burnt in the Hand , & c. THe first Trial of note was of a Woman-Servant , who had robb 'd her Master , at several times , of a very great Sum of Money : The Gentleman miss 'd about Six hundred pounds , but the Prisoner had Confess 'd Two hundred , which she purloyn 'd by the help of a false Key to his Closet . Yet now she would seem to deny all , and lay it upon some other persons belonging to the Family ; but the Crime was too apparent to be evaded , and so she was found Guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] John Moor and Thomas Sides were Arraigned and Tried on several Indictments ; First for breaking open this Warehouse of Mr. Samuel Harris in Bartholomew-Close . The matter appeared to be thus ; On the 23th of June last , these Fellows having , 't is probable , observed this Ware-house to be well-furnisht with Stuffs , and no body to lie in it , ( for Mr. Harris 's house was elsewhere at a distance ) they came about four of the Clock in the Morning and broke it open , and carried away Bundles of Stuffs which a Neighbour observing , thought at first by their Habit , that they might be some workmen belonging to Mr. Harris ; but taking notice that neither he nor his Brother that dwelt with him appeared , when they saw the Prisoners come the second time , began to have a suspicion of them ; though one of the Thieves perceiving himself seen , knocks a little at the Door before he entred , to colour the business ; however the witness , like an honest Man and good Neigbour , went to Mr. Harris 's house , and calling them up , enquired whether they had employed any persons to remove any Stuffs that Morning ; and being answered in the Negative , and some of his Family immediately coming forth to look after the Thieves , upon enquiry after such persons so loaded , found they pass 'd through Ducklane , and that they were seen to go into an Alehouse with their Bundles , near Clothfair-gate . Whereupon knocking there , the Victualler himself after some time came to the Door , but stoutly denied that anysuch people had come into his house , or were there ; but the Constable ( whom by that time the Prosecutor had procured ) told him , he must needs search his house ; and doing so , soon found the several Bundles of Stuffs , but could not so readily discover the Thieves , for the house was contrived with notable private holes proper for Concealments So a Workman was called to assist to finde out any such secret places , and in one of them they met with a whole bundle of Perriwigs , and Cases of Barbers Instruments at last they happend 'd into a small dark Room , where one of the Prisoners John Moor was in Bed , and pretending to be fast asleep ; yet they observe 'd the Bed-cloaths very smooth , as if he were but just laid down and turning off the Cloaths , they found he had still one stocking on . And looking under the Bed , they espied his Companion , who had hid himself there , and being dragg 'd out was very unruly , fighting with all that came near him , till he was master 'd ; and in his Mouth be had two Guinnies and some Silver that he had stolen out of the Till of Mr. Harris 's Counter : And likewise there was taken on him some brass Half Crowns , that had lain by the several years . Being carried before Sir William Turner , they behaved themselves very insolently , and upon notorious Evidence of the Fact were Committed to Newgate ; And the business being noised , what things were found in their Lodging , Mr. Thomson and Mr. Baker , two persons whose Shops were lately broke open , came to view them ; and as to the Perriwigs , Mr. Thompson Swore them to be the same that were stolen from him , and Mr. Baker own 'd the three Cases of instruments . So that now there were three Indictments against them , on all which they were found Guilty : And on that for Robbing Mr. Harris , Grains the Alehouse-Keeper , where they were taken , was likewise Indicted with them as an Accessary after to the Felony , and fairly Convicted for the same ; though he made all the Defence that could be , having some Relations of very good Worth and Reputation ; But so much the more is he to be blamed , for scandalizing his Family with such base practises . This Moor was formerly Tryed for Treason for Coyning or Clipping , and Sides was burnt in the hand but last Sessions ; they had lately taken a Lodging in Mr. Grains house , who alleadged that they went out and in that morning the Robbery was committed without his privity ; which was the reason he denyed that any such men were come in these , he not knowing any thing of it , & c. [ Sides : Death . See summary . ] Mary Clark was Convicted for Murdering her Bastard Child ; she was a Lodger in Rosemary-Lane , and went for a widdow , and was delivered without any notice taken by the people of the house : but the Infant being accidentally discovered in the house of Office , there arose some suspition it might be hers ; who upon Examination at first denyed it , but by view of her Breasts , and other symptomes , it appearing she had lately had a Child , they taking her more earnestly , she confessed it , but alledged it was still born ; but having no witness thereof , as the Statute required she was found guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] Elizabeth Unison was found guilty of Felony , for Robbing her Master of ten or twelve pounds in Money , part of which she confessed , acknowledging that she spent five pounds in one day , and telling him where twenty shillings more of it was . An old Thief was convicted of stealing Pewter out of the House of one Mrs. Cleverton , a widow keeping a Coffee-house in Bell-Savage yard on Ludgate-hill four or five of them came in , and called for two Tankards of drink , and took an opportunity to steal five Dishes , and several Plates out of a small Buttery had that tended them not liking their looks and carriage , ask the Maid if she had lost any thing ; who not presently missing the Pewter replyed No ; but having laid down a Groat , and being going away in some confusion , some of the plates dropt down in the room , from or very near the now prisoner whereupon the rest fled , and cleverly carried off the five Dishes , this fellow onely being taken , who proves a notorious offender , and very lately was in for other Rogueries , but escaped ; however , theJury were favourable , finding him onely guilty of Petite Larceny , that is to the value of ten pence . William Westwood a Carter , was Tryed for killing one Jeremy Normel , a person of the same profession . There being sevreal terms together , Normel suddenly whipt the Horse and drove them so , as they had like to have hurt a Boy that belonged to the Prisoner , who was so incensed , that he run and gave Normel a box on the ear ; not that it could be imagined he had any design to kill him , but so unhappily it hapned , that with the Blow he fell down ; and the Horses going on , the wheels , or one of the wheels of the Cart run over his Head , and shattered it to pieces , so that he never spake word more . It was proved , that the Prisoner when he saw him fall so dangerously , endeavoured all he could to pull him away , but could not so suddenly do it as to prevent the mischief , for which he now appeared much affected with sorrow , not was there any proof of former malice between them ; so that upon the whole matter he was found guilty but of Manslaughter . A young Wench coming with four more of her naughty Companions to a Victualling House in the Hay market , went up stairs , and fetcht some Victuals from a Cooks , and made several other sleeveless errands to and fro , to watch and amuse the people of the House , whilst in the mean time some of the Crew slipt up another pair of stairs , broke open a Chest of Drawers , and stole eight pound in Money , several Rings , and other things of value : they went away for the present ; but the people having taken better notice of the Prisoner than of any of the rest , by reason of her often going in and out , met with her soon after , and now swore it directly , that she was one of the Company , whereupon she was Convicted of the Felony . A young man was questioned for stealing an Horse , being met on the Road upon one that was stoln some time since : but there came a person now that justified he sold the said Horse to the Prisoner ; but how he himself came by him , is a question that must be examined another time ; in the mean while the Prisoner was discharged . But the most remarkable Trial was of two Gentlemen of considerable quality , viz . Mr. Doughty and Mr. Hambleton , for killing one Philip Caps a Coachman ; touching which a multitude of Witnesses were Examin 'd , and the Circumstances were too many and various to be here related punctually , but the effect thereof was as follows ; Mr. Doughty having made use of the Deceased 's Coach , coming at last to a person of Qualitie 's house in the Palace-yard , was discharging him , and so offer 'd him what he thought was reasonable for his Fare ; but the Coachman insisted that it was too little , and would not take it : whereupon words arose , and the Gentleman beat the Coachman soundly , without drawing his Sword ; during which Bussle Mr. Hambleton came forth of the person of Qualities house , and knowing Mr. Doughty well , encouraged him to beat the Coachman , and advised him to make him down on his knees and ask him forgiveness . Having thus chastized the Coachman , Mr. Doughty went from him into the Court-yard and shut the door after him ; but the Coachman not yet satisfied , followed , and clapping his foot to the door , pusht it open : then Mr. Doughty drew his Sword , and gave him several wounds ; one Witness seemed to say , Mr. Hambletons Sword was also drawn , but the rest did not see any such thing ; but 't was proved , that the poor man being down , after he had received some wounds , begged very heartily for his Life that he would not kill him , crying out he was wounded ; whereupon Doughty desisting from his fury , some people took him up , and opening his Doublet , found abundance of Blood : he had below the left pap a large wound , and as was supposed deep , being run into the Body ; but the Witnesses for the Prisoner represented it as onely superficial , that the Rapier glanc 'd along on the Ribs , and so made very little penetration ; he was likewise wounded in the Thigh , and on the Nose , and forehead , and a Cut on the hand . Perceiving him in this desperate condition , Doughty presently caused him to be carried to a Surgeon , and all the care imaginable to be taken for him , that he should want nothing necessary for Diet or Cure . The Wounds were given 10 April , and towards the end of May , seemed to be wholly healed , Doughty paying the Surgeon , and supplying the man with Money to support him , who appeared so well , that he went abroad , and once drove his Coach , but it being a wet day , it was supposed he caught cold , and thereupon relapsed , and soon after dyed : the Witnesses for the Prisoner were of opinion that he dyed of a Feaver , but there were several Arguments that swayed the Court and Jury to a contrary belief : for first , during his last sickness he vomited abundance of Blood , so that it was probable , though the Wounds were healed up outwardly , yet there was no perfect Cure wrought within ; and besides , the man to the last declared , That he must charge his death on the wounds so received . After several hours Examination of Witnesses , and consideration of all Circumstances , the Jury acquitted Mr. Hambleton , and brought in Mr. Doughty guilty of Murther . [ Death . See summary . ] Arthur Garland was Convicted for picking the pocket of one Marg . Rumley , and stealing from her an Hankercheif : he was an old practitioner in that Mystery , and to aggravate his Crime , no place was so sacred as to deter him from it , for this Fact was done in St. Sepulchres Church , where being known , one that belonged to the Church watcht him , and saw him dive in one mans pocket without any booty , then he came to this woman , and angled out her Handkerchief , but being presently taxed , dropt it . The Jury found him guilty , and the value of the Handkerchief six pence . It was said , that some of the Diving Gang should declare , That they would go no more to Church , because many of them had had such ill there of late , but henceforth they would haunt the Quakers Meetings , and nip their things without controul , because they would not swear , and if so there was no danger of Conviction . Two Broker s a man and a woman , were Tryed for receiving stoln Goods , but for want of direct proof escaped . A fellow was found guilty for stealing a parcel of Tin ; and four persons , viz . William Abbot , Ed . Williams , Edward Pritchard , and Samuel Griffith , were Convicted for stealing a parcel of Damask Curtains , a silk Quilt , and embroidered Belt , and other Goods to a considerable value ; being seen early in a morning with such bundles about Shooe-lane , by an honest man that knew some of them , he caused them to be apprehended , and since the Goods appeared to have been stoln from a person of Honour : but two of the Prisoners being but Boys and Pup is , as it may be supposed to the other two , they were found guilty only to the value of of ten pence , the other two of Felony . There were several Tryed , and some Convicted for petty Felonies , and especially that common practice of Shop-lifting ; and stealing of Tankards out of Drinking-houses . John Giles , as one of those that made the late barbarous Attempt upon Justice Arnold , and who was lately brought up out of the Countrey where he was taken , was Arraigned on an Indictment of Misdemeanour for that villany , but made many excuses to put off the Tryal , as that he had no notice of it , that his Witnesses were not here , & c. To which Justice Arnold , who was ready with his Witnesses , answered ; That he had as much notice of the time of Tryal as himself ; That he had brought up his Witnesses , and so might the said Giles if he had any ; and that the matter was made publick enough , notice having been given that it should now be Tryed , in the Gazet ; the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor was likewise very urgent not to have it put off any longer , as apprehending these pretences and delays to be nothing but the usual shams which Papists commonly have to shuffle off Justice ; but at last , to the end the Prisoner might not have the least pretence to complain that he was surprized , the Court was pleased to put his Tryal off till Wednesday next in the afternoon , and by the time , if he have any Witnesses , he may bring them even from St. Omers . Mr. Herbert , formerly in custody concerning the same matter , and Bailed , was now bound over again , with Sureties to appear the first day of next Term at the Kings Bench-Bar , he having since , ( as was proved by several Witnesses ) most violently and inhumanely beaten a poor Woman in the Countrey , and to his fury gave this worthy reason for it . That she had done his Friend Giles an injury , or words to that effect , as supposing it seems her concerned in discovering him . He seemed to resent it hard , that he should be prosecuted by so mean a person , but was very well answered , That when he should beat women of greater Quality , he should have better people to prosecute him ; in the mean time , 't was all the reason in the world that this Woman though never so poor , should have right done her . There were in all Nine persons Contemned to dye , six Men and then Women , viz . Philip Doughty and Mary Clarke for Murder : Jane Lant for Robbing Jane Davies of thirteen pound seven shillings and six pence in Money , and Cloaths to the value of thirty pound : Isabel Starling for Robbing her Master of two hundred pound ; The sides for the Robbery in Bartholomew close , and other Felouies : Samuel Griffith an old Offender for a Felony : Joseph nestner , and William Wilson , for Robbing on the High-way as poor-gads : and James Carew for a Burghlary in the House of Richard Bedding his Neighbour , and stealing fifty shillings in money , the womans Wedding Ring , and other goods . Besides these that are to dye , there were Eight burnt in the Hand , Two that are to be Transported , Ten to be Whipt .
