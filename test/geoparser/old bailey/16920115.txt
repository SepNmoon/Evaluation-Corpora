Mary Stretch , Catherine Seymour , William Jones , Thomas Banks , Robert Trumball , Robert Adderton , Elizabeth Clarke , Matthias Browne , John Ray , alias Rea , Mary Hemingway .

Then the Court was pleased to give them a most seasonable Exhortation , pertinent to the occasion , to this effect ; telling them , That they were now in a good posture of submission , being bowed upon their Knees ; hoping that they were also relenting in their Hearts , for that they had all been great Offenders , not only against the Laws of Man , but of an All-seeing God , who would call every one of them to a strict and particular Account for all their Actions , and therefore it behoved them to beg Pardon of both ; and as they had obtained Mercy from the Goodness and Clemency of so Gracious a King and Queen , so they would endeavour to demonstrate their thankfulness for so great a Deliverance , by living in holy , humble , and honest life for the time to come , that being the least part of their Duty for such extraordinary Pity ; putting them in mind how many notorious Offenders ( in nature like to themselves ) were gone before to the fatal tree yet They were spared : therefore it was now hoped , that such particular Indulgence to them would work such a thorow change upon their Hearts and Lives , that their whole Life should be dedicated to the Service of God , and that no temptation whatsoever should be able to draw them aside ; remembring withal , That the shedding of a few Tears here , will not satisfie offended Justice , except they universally repent , and turn to God with all their Hearts and Souls , & c. After this the Court was pleased to particularize some of their Offences to them , not any ways to upbraid their former dissolute Lives , but calmly to caution them , to take heed how they steer 'd their Course for the future ; that they might not split upon the same Rock , some of them being but young in Years , yet old Offenders ; therefore it was hoped they would take heed of falling into the like Danger ; for if they did , they must not expect to receive such Pardon , as now happly they had met withal : And furthermore , if they who were to be Transported should return into England , before Seven Years were expired , it would certainly prove a great detriment to them , even to the Loss of their Lives , if overtaken in such a desperate Adventure , & c. Another amongst them was more particularly remarked , viz . John Ray , alias Red , who was condemned formerly for Clipping and Coyning the current Money of England : He receiving such Mercy as to be freely Pardoned , and not Transported ( as he deserved ) was told , That it was required of him ( being more sensible than some others ) to lay out his whole Interest for the Service of King William and Queen Mary : but if he thought to undermine the true Interest and Government of the Crown and Church of England ( as it was to be feared his Religion might teach him ) then he would certainly find himself to be mistaken ; for upon this Rock have I built my Church , faith a much better than the best , & c. The Conclusion was in the general to all of them , That notwithstanding their Crimes could not be particulary recounted , yet the Court hoped they would be all forwarned by this particular Grace , and distinguishing Favour , as never to offend any more in the like nature , but that they may have Grace to serve God for the time to come .

John Ray , alias Red , who was condemned formerly for Clipping and Coyning the current Money of England : He receiving such Mercy as to be freely Pardoned , and not Transported ( as he deserved ) was told , That it was required of him ( being more sensible than some others ) to lay out his whole Interest for the Service of King William and Queen Mary : but if he thought to undermine the true Interest and Government of the Crown and Church of England ( as it was to be feared his Religion might teach him ) then he would certainly find himself to be mistaken ; for upon this Rock have I built my Church , faith a much better than the best , & c. The Conclusion was in the general to all of them , That notwithstanding their Crimes could not be particulary recounted , yet the Court hoped they would be all forwarned by this particular Grace , and distinguishing Favour , as never to offend any more in the like nature , but that they may have Grace to serve God for the time to come .
