Both Guilty . 3. William Moreland , and John Fellows , were a 2d Time indicted with Jonathan Austin , of Christ Church , Spittlefields , for assaulting David Nix , in a certain Alley , call 'd Smock Alley , near the King 's Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Hat , value 7 s. May 23 . David Nix . On the 23d of May , I was passing from Widegate Alley , into Smock Alley , and saw 3 or 4 Fellows standing together . It was Moonlight , and as near as I can guess , about 10 o'Clock . I little thought they had a Design against me ; but as I turn 'd up by the Coffee House , the Prisoner Austin knock 'd up my Heels , and took my Hat off my Head . I caught fast hold of the Skirts of his Coat , and held him , 'till the Mob subsisted ( came ) to help me : I never quitted my Hold , 'till the Constable came , and then I deliver 'd him into his Hands . His Companions seeing me hold him , and hearing me cry out , - stop Thief , they took to their Heels and ran away , crying out - stop Thief too . Joseph Miller . The three Prisoners and I met together the 23d of May , at Night , in Bishopsgate-Street , about 10 o'Clock . The Watch not being set , we dogg 'd him out of Bishopsgate-Street , into Widegate Alley , and imagin 'd he was fuddl 'd . At the Gingerbread Baker 's he lighted his Pipe , and then went towards Smock Alley ; we follow 'd him , with each of us a Stick in our Hands , and intended to knock him down ; but Austin ran up to him in Smock Alley , and snatch 'd off his Hat , and gave it the Prisoner Fellows . I ran to the Tenter Grounds , in Moorefields , and there he ( Fellows ) came to me with the Hat , which I kept all Night in my own Custody , and next Morning I pawn 'd it , next Door to the two Horns , near Shoreditch Church . The Prosecutor Nix appear 'd that Morning against Austin , before the Justice , and being positive to him he was committed . Three or four Days after this , I was taken up for another Robbery , and then I made my Information . We went out together with an Intent to rob who we could ; for Austin and Moreland having been out together a whole Fortnight , Night and Day , they had spent and made away with all we had to live upon , so we resolved to go out upon the Highway to get what we could . I was three Weeks in New-Prison , with Jonathan Austin , and had not put him into my Information , if I had not heard that he had confess 'd the Fact before Justice Booth . Austin . Did you see me take the Man 's Hat off : Miller . Before he ran from us toward the Man , he said he wou 'd go and kick his Heels up ; I was at some little distance from the Prosecutor , when the Thing was done , so I ca n't swear I saw him take off the Hat ; and the Man seiz 'd him directly , and cry 'd out . When he cry 'd stop Thief , I ran down Duke Street , and cry 'd stop Thief too , or else I should have been taken . Nix . The Prisoner Austin was the Man that took off my Hat : I asked him what was the Reason he did so , and he knock 'd up my Heels directly ; then some of them said , - knock his Brains out with a Brick-bat . John Briggs . I am the Officer that took Moreland Fellows , and the Evidence Miller . He told me the Prosecutor went into a Shop in Bishopsgate-Street , for a Half-p'orth of Tobacco , and they seeing him pull out a Handful of Silver and Half-pence , and thinking him to be fuddled , they resolved to follow him and rob him . Accordingly they dogg 'd him into Widegate Alley , where he went in at the Gingerbread Baker 's to light his Pipe ; from thence ( he said ) they follow 'd him into Smock Alley , to rob him . Robert Hill . I have only this to say : I took the Evidence and two of the Prisoners ; and on Monday last I was with them in Newgate ; they told me the Evidence was a Black-Guard Rogue , and that they were sorry they must die for such a triffling Thing , and had not done something whereby they might have maintain 'd themselves in Jail . Mary Keddit , Pawnbroker . I know nothing of the Prisoners , but on Monday there was a Hat fetch 'd out of Pawn , which lay in Moreland 's Name for 18 d. Henry Davis , Constable . A Quarter before 11 o'Clock at Night , the 23d of May , the Prosecutor brought the Prisoner Austin to my House , and charg 'd him with robbing him of his Hat . I ask 'd him if he could swear he was the Person that stole it ? No , says he , but he was one of the Company , and he attempted to trip up my Heels , so I lay 'd hold of him . I went with him before Justice Dennet the next Day , and there he swore he saw him take off his Hat , and give it to another , who ran away with it . Benjamin Leonard . I am a Watchman belonging to this Officer ; and the Night the Robbery was committed , I went to call him up , to take charge of Austin . The Prosecutor told him , he had lost his Hat ; the Officer asked him if he could lay the Felony to him ? No , says he , but he was one of the three , that threaten 'd to trip up my Heels , and so I seiz 'd him . Daniel Perrington . I live in Three Tun-Alley , and saw the Constable , the Watch , and the Prisoner Austin together , between 11 and 12 o'Clock at Night , the 23d of May . I went down with them to the Tower Jail , and there the Prosecutor said , he was not the Man that took his Hat off ; but next Morning before the Justice , he swore he did take it . He said indeed ( the Night before ) that he was one that belonged to the other Fellows , and before we went to Justice Dennet with him , one of their Company came down , and propos 'd making the Matter up , and the Prosecutor seem 'd willing to do it . Elizabeth Wood confirm 'd the Constable 's Evidence , with Relation to what pass 'd at his House . Richard Webb . The Prisoner Austin was my Servant ; he work 'd with me till the Saturday before he was taken up . He lay in the Shop , where I weave rich Brocades , and have had great Quantities of Gold , Silver and Silk ; I never knew that he wrong 'd me while he liv 'd with me . He quitted my Service the 13th of May , on account of some Words which he had with his Mistress ; but what the Quarrel was , I ca n't tell . John Graves , John Swift , Joshua Wright , Charles Bromfield , and Benjamin Griffith , knew the Prisoner Austin from a Child , and never heard any ill Character of him , 'till he was charg 'd with this Fact . The Jury found all the three Prisoners Guilty . Death . 4. George Nock , of St. Sepulchre 's was indicted for ripping and stealing 20 lb . of Lead , value 3 s. fix 'd to the Dwelling-house of William Watlington , May 27 , Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5. Sarah Webster , of St. Sepulchre 's , was indicted for stealing a Guinea , the Money of Edward Clark , May 28 . It appear 'd that the Prisoner was sent up Stairs to clean Mr. Clark 's Room ; after which a Guinea was miss 'd out of a Drawer , in the same Room ; the Prisoner was charg 'd with taking it , and was carried before Mr. Alderman Perry , where she confess 'd the Fact , and that she had given the Money to her Sweet Heart . And this Confession being made without any Promises of shewing her Favour , the Jury found her Guilty . Single Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 6. Daniel Kelly , was indicted for stealing a Quarter-Barrel of Raisins , value 10 s. the Goods of Thomas Gordon , in the Parish of St. Mary-Hill , May 25 . Mr. Gordon . On the 25th of May , my Cooper and a Constable came to tell me a Man had stole a Quarter-Barrel of Raisins from Smart's-Key , where I had thirty in all . I went down to the Key , and miss 'd one of them . They told me the Man was in Custody ; and while I was talking to them , the Barrel was brought to me , and had been taken out of the River ; for the Prisoner ( it seems ) had thrown it over Board . The Mark upon the Barrel was mine , and I believe it was my Property . I lost nothing by the Goods , but sold them for the same Money , as I should have done , had nothing of this happen 'd . William Symmonds . I was coming in a Boat past Smart's-Key , and saw the Prisoner there , with a Barrel in his Arms . He was coming into a Boat with it , and tumbled down , Barrel and all , into the Boat . My Waterman said , - There 's a Thief . I made him shove back , and then the Prisoner heav 'd something over board . Upon this we took him , and carry 'd him ashore . In his Boat we found two Pieces of the Head of the Barrel , and some of the Raisins . In two or three Hours afterwards , the Barrel was taken out of the Water , and we compar 'd the Pieces we found in the Bottom of the Boat , with the Breaches in the Head of the Barrel , and they fitted : Part of the Mark was upon the Pieces , which flew out when he fell with the Barrel , and part was upon the Head of the Barrel itself . We found , by comparing this Mark , with that upon Mr. Gordon 's Barrels , that the Goods belonged to him , so they sent for him , and he own 'd them . Robert Colson , the Waterman , confirm 'd Mr. Symmonds . Testimony , adding , that he very plainly saw the Prisoner throw the Barrel over-board , after he tumbled into his Boat , and that the Pieces of the Barrel Head , which were shewn Mr. Gordon , were the same that he took out of the Prisoner 's Boat Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] Isaac George ( a Blackamoor ) was indicted for assaulting John Gravener , in the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Pair of Silver-bow 'd Scissars , value 5 s. a Silver Spatula , value 4 s. a Silver Probe , value 6 d. a Steel crooked Needle , value 1 d a Fish skin Case with Silver Hinges and Clasps , value 10 s. 6 d. three Lancers , with Tortoiseshell Scales , value 3 s. a Gum Lancet , value 1 s. a black Shagreen Case , value 5 s. a Silver Seal , value 2 s. 6 d. and 7 d. in Money , April 30 . Mr. Gravener . As I return 'd from Endfield , on Sunday Night , the 30th of April , the Prisoner and another Man attack 'd me in the Highway . They struck at me with their Clubs , and my Horse threw me . I got up , and ran away from them , about 150 or 200 Yards towards Islington Town , but happening to fall in a Cart-rut , the Prisoner and his Accomplice overtook me , and robb 'd me of the Things mention 'd in the Indictment , they likewise took from me 6 d. and some Half-pence . The Prisoner was the Man that seiz 'd me first , and he and his Comrade rifled me . When I fell from my Horse I lost my Hat , so after I had been rifled , I desired them to let me have my Hat ; they said , they did not desire that , and I went back with them , to the Place where I fell , and found it , the two Men guarding me all the Time . The Reason of my desiring to go back was , that I thought some Body might come by , as we were going up the Road , and then I would have endeavour 'd to have taken them . I am sure the Prisoner is one of the Men that robb 'd me , - he is a Black , and 't was he that walk 'd on my right Hand , when I went back to look for my Hat . Prisoner . I know nothing of this Affair . Mr. Gravener . When I first saw the Prisoner in Bridewell , I asked him if he knew me ? He said , - No , he never saw me ( to his Knowledge ) before in his Life . I asked him if he could give any Account how he had spent his Time last Monday ? Yes , says he , I have been a Month in the Hospital , and was discharged from thence about a Fortnight ago , and the People of the Hospital can be Witnesses for me . Guilty Death . 8. Catherine Simpson , of St. Ann 's Westminster , was indicted for stealing two Holland Shirts , value 16 s. three Linnen Caps , value 1 s. 6 d. a Pair of worsted Stockings , value 6 d. a Muslin Handkerchief , value 1 s. a Necklace , value 6 d. a Pair of Brass Shoe buckles , value 1 d. a Dimity Pocket value 6 d. the Goods of Mary Clancey . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 9. John Wright , was indicted , for that he being a Person of an evil Disposition , and the Laws of this Realm not regarding , after the first of June , 1723 , viz . on the 13th of June last , knowingly , unlawfully , and feloniously did send a certain Letter in writing , without Name or Date , directed to William Dolley , demanding the Sum of 30 l. and containing divers Threats of the Life , and burning the House of the said Dolley , if the said Money should not be paid , according to the Directions of the said Letter , to the great Damage of the said Dolley , against the Form of the Statute , to the evil Example of others , and against the Peace , & c. William Dolley . I was at a Neighbour 's House the 13th of this Month , and the next Witness ( Alice Barnard ) came to me , and desired I would make haste Home , and bring one of my Company with me , for a threatening Letter was sent me . When I came Home , the Prisoner stood within the Shop ; I took a slight Glance on the Letter , and then I double-lock 'd the Door , to secure the Prisoner . I then asked the Prisoner if he knew what he had done ? He said , No . I search 'd him immediately , for fear he should have Pistols , or Knives about him , - that is , - I clapp 'd my Hands upon his Cloaths , - I did not put them into his Pockets . When I found he had nothing about him , I took him into a little back Room , behind the Shop , and read the Letter to him . All that I could get out of him , was , that he knew nothing of it . I told him , if he would let me know who were his Accomplices , I would be favourable to him , and he should not go to Jail ; but he told me , he was so strongly sworn , that he could not say any Thing . Upon this , I sent for a Constable , and would have sent him to New-Prison ; the Prisoner told me I could not send him to Prison , without first carrying him before a Magistrate . For this Reason , I desired the Constable to carry him before a Magistrate , but he did not think proper to do so , least his Comrades should be near , and do me a Mischief , so he was carry 'd to Prison . The next Morning we had him to the Elephant and Castle , in order to his going before the Justice , and there he wrote this Note ( producing it ) to send for his Friends ; some Persons now in Court , saw him write it ; and upon comparing it with the Letter he brought me , the Hands agreed . I charged him immediately with having wrote the Letter himself , and had him before Mr. Justice Poulson , where he confess 'd he wrote the Letter he brought me himself . Mr. Poulson prov 'd the Confession was voluntarily sign 'd , after it had been read over to the Prisoner. `` Middlesex . To wit . The Confession of John `` Wright , taken before me , & c. `` Who being examin 'd , saith , that Yesterday , `` the 13th of June , he wrote a Letter to Mr. `` William Dolley , in Holborn , demanding the Sum `` of 30 l. and threatening , on Refusal to pay the `` said Money , to kill him , and reduce his House `` to Ashes . And that the said Letter , and every `` Word thereof , is the proper Hand of this `` Examinant . John Wright . The Letter was read. `` To Mr. William Dolley , Ironmonger , at the `` Warming-Pan , at his House in Holborn . SIR , `` This is to acquaint you , that there are a certain `` Number of poor Men , who , without present `` Help , will be ruin 'd : Therefore we all consent `` to send to four able Gentlemen , like yourself , `` for some of that old Gold , that has lain by you `` so long .

'' Mr. Dolley . Here is Mr. Rawlinson , who will give some Account of the Prisoner : He was try 'd about a Year and a Quarter ago , on much such an Affair . * * The Prisoner was try 'd ( for setting Fire to Mr. Arthur Rawlinson 's House ) in April Sessions , 1737 . Vide Sessions Book for that Year , No IV . p. 94. Alice Barnard . The Prisoner brought this Letter for my Master , and deliver 'd it to an Errand Boy , before me . He said it was for Mr. Dolley , and required an Answer . I carry 'd it in to my Mistress , Mr. Dolley 's Partner , and she open 'd it . I told the Prisoner , my Master was at a Neighbour 's House , and that I would go and call him . He thanked me , and said he waited for an Answer . I perceived my Mistress was very much surprised , so I went and call 'd my Master . Prisoner . I desire my Friends may be call 'd . William Cruikshank . I have known the Prisoner about two Years and a half ; and always observed him to have been seiz 'd with a rooted melancholy Desperation . Some Time or other in the Month either of November or December 1735 , he wrote a Letter to me , full of the most melancholy desperate Expressions , declaring himself to be a Person devoted to eternal Destruction , and abandon 'd of God . I endeavour 'd to answer all his unreasonable Objections , and I thought to some good Effect ; but soon after , his old Melancholy return 'd , which I imagin 'd was occasioned , because he had never been baptized ; being descended of Parents , who were of the People call 'd Quakers . As far as I can remember , he mention 'd this , as the Reason of his Melancholy . On the 29th of February , 1735-6 , he was baptized , and about a Month after , he received the Holy Communion , - after he had been instructed in the Principles of the Christian Religion . In the Month of April or May following , his Melancholy recurr 'd in such a Manner , that he made two Attempts upon his own Life , by endeavouring to drown himself in St. James 's Park . When I came to know the Cause , I endeavoured all that lay in my Power , to give him ease ; and I thought I had succeeded ; but he was continually in a melancholly way after that . I forgot to observe that the two Attempts of Self-Murder , were about a Year before the unhappy Affair of Mr. Rawlinson , in the Months of April and May , after his receiving the Sacrament . That Affair was under the Cognizance of this Court about a Year and a Quarter ago ; I was not then in this Country ; but that was the Effect of his Melancholy , for he express 'd himself , that it was better for him to be cut off by the Hand of the Civil Magistrate , than to be his own Executioner . After he was acquitted of that Affair , we thought he behav 'd pretty soberly , and we were in hopes his melancholy Distemper would wear off ; but it recurr 'd again in the Month of September 1737 , to a high Degree , as appears by this Letter , which he sent to Mrs. Corse . I did not see him write it , but as far as I can judge of any Man 's Writing , I can judge of that Letter , and I have all the moral certainty in the World , that 't is his Hand . I had it from the Person to whom it was sent by the Penny Post ; and I believe , was the Letter read , the Court would see some of the oddest Expressions that ever were heard ; and I have all the moral Reason to believe , it was the Effect of a rooted , desperate Melancholy . Since the Writing of this Letter , he has made use of melancholy Expressions to me , and has said , he was weary of Life and wanted to be out of this World ; this was this last Spring , but I can not ascertain the particular Time . As for the Lad 's Character , I can say , that I have always known him to be sober ; never guilty of any Immoralities , except those that were the Effect of his downright Melancholy . And as for his Accomplices , I have all the Reason in the World to believe he had none , for he never kept any bad Company . Rachel Bamfield . The Prisoner 's Mother was my own Sister , and a very honest just Woman she was . His Father was a little disorder 'd in his Brain , and oftentimes in the Spring would leave his Family . He had a Sister this last Summer confined for the Disorder he is now in , - she was quite raving . I never knew him guilty of an ill Action , except Mr. Rawlinson 's Affair last Summer and this . James Wallis . I have known him , and seen him often for these two Years ; once I was in his Company among other young Men , and he told us , he was certainly damn 'd and ruin 'd to all Eternity . I have seen him often , and he behaved well , but would use these Expressions . Another Time he said he would go and drown himself in St. James 's Park ; but a Thought came into his Head , and he would not do it at that Time . Mary Telford . I have been intimately acquainted with the Prisoner about four Months , by living in the House with him ; and he behav 'd always very circumspectly , when he was out of these Flights ; but sometimes he would fly out , and I would advise him to throw of those Flights ; he used to say he could not , and wish 'd he might die , that he might no longer carry about with him this Body of Sin . Before this Accident happened , he was blooded , and lost a Porringer full of Blood , and would have been blooded again , and have lost more , but the Man would not permit it . About three Weeks or a Month ago , he told me he was going to be bad again , but desired I would not let his Friends know ; and I ( foolish ) kept the Secret . 'T was but the Day before this Letter was delivered , that I was singing a Verse of the 138th Psalm to him , and he wish 'd I could sing him into Heaven with that Tune , for he was weary of his Life ; and about a Fortnight before he attempted to hang himself . John Redding . The Prisoner has made Shoes for me near a Twelve-month ; and I have taken him out among my merry Shoe-makers to divert him ; but he has not been able to bear it . He has told me he was tempted to destroy himself , once to hang himself , another Time to drown himself ? then to starve or bleed himself to Death . He brought me Home a Pair of Shoes that Afternoon he did this Thing , and I knew he was going into one of his Flights . Sometimes he was capable of doing his Business , and sometimes he was not . Robert Forest . I have known him two Years , and never knew any Thing by him , but what was solid and sober , except when he was in those Fits . I have heard him over and over express despairing Words , - Words of deep despair , and that he should surely perish . I have begg 'd of him to mind his Duty to God , and not to concern himself so much about sacred Things . At some Times he would have some glimmering of Hope , but oftener would be in despair , and say he was sure he should be damn 'd . Ivel Northam . The Prisoner has lodged with me sometimes , at his own request , I have had Conversation with him ; he was always melancholy , and afraid of his Damnation . One Sunday I was talking to him , and he said , - is it not better for me to leave off all Religion , than to be such a scandal to it as I am . I gave him good Advice , and he said , he wish 'd he could take it , but ( says he ) I am a hard hearted Creature , and shall split upon the Rock of Despair at last . The Day after he was taken , I went to him in Prison , and I said , John Wright , as you stand before the great God , declare on what Account you sent this Letter ; was it for the Money ? No . Was it to hang yourself ? He answered , 't is better to be executed by the Laws of the Land , than to murther ones self . Why , says I , what Proof have you of your being damned ? Because ( says he ) he that believeth not , shall be damned . I then asked him where the Man liv 'd , that he had carry 'd the Letter to ? He would not tell me . I beg 'd of him for God 's Sake , - for my Sake , who was his Friend to tell me ; at last he only told me it was to an Ironmonger ; but he desired none of his Friends would trouble themselves , but let the Law have its Course ; and he should rejoice ( he said ) if he was then in the Cart , and was going to Tyburn ; and that he had been often tempted to take off somebody 's Hat , in the Streets , that he might do the Work effectually . Richard Gardiner . I could say a great deal more ; but that I think is of no Effect , - but he used to run after the Romish Priests , that are disputing about Transubstantiation , and the Infalibity of the Church . I perceived a great Disorder in the Head , and heard odd Expressions ; and I would have you consider , whether the Person is not prejudic 'd , and has not Interest into the Case , for this Day I asked him at Hick 's Hall whether his Bill was rectify 'd , and he told me , if one Bill would not do , another should , - and therefore I think he is partial . As to the Prisoner 's Prosession , I ca n't tell what it is he has so many Notions running in his Head about the Roman Priests . Sometimes he goes to one Place , sometimes to another . I have been at St. Ann 's Church with him , and other Churches beside . The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death . 10. Elizabeth Wright , was indicted for stealing a camblet Gown , value 12 s. a hoop Petticoat , value 1 s. two Gold Rings set with Bristol Stones , value 4 s. a holland Apron , value 2 s. a silk Manteel , value 6 d. the Goods of Walter Willoughby , June 9 .

The 14th Day of this Month , between Twelve and One o'Clock at Night , I lost two black Geldings out of a common Field in Gloucestershire . The Prisoner is my Neighbour : I ca n't swear I found them upon him , but one of them I found in this Man 's ( Davis 's ) Possession : he was selling him in Smithfield . I seiz 'd him , and carry 'd Davis before my Lord-Mayor . While I was doing this , the Hostler at the Rose-Inn came to me , and asked me , if I had not lost another , I told him yes , I had lost another , with a Star in his Forehead , two white Heels behind , and a white Foot before . Upon this , I went with him to the Rose , and he brought out my other Horse to me . A little while afterwards , as he and I were coming from a Coffee-House , where we had been to see for the Prisoner , we met him in the Street : Neighbour , says I to him , 't is an odd Thing you should take my Horses away ! He had not a Word to say for himself , but was ready to sink when he saw me . David Davis The Prisoner brought the Horse to my Stables , and ask 'd me if he could be put up ? I took the Horse in , the 16th of this Month , and baited him ; 't was a Cart black Gelding , with but one Eye . The Same Day I bought the Horse of the Prisoner , in my own Stables , for 4 Guineas and a half ; I gave him half a Guinea earnest , and was to pay him the rest in a few Days . He told me he bought this Horse and another in Wiltshire , and I said , 't was hardly worth his while to go so far , to buy two such Horses ; I brought them up with me , says he , only to help to make up my Charges . When we had agreed for the Horse , I carry 'd him to Smith-field to sell again ; and there Hinton found him out , and claim 'd him . I know nothing of the other Horse . Benj Taylor . The Prisoner came to my Master Davis 's Stables , at the George in Hedge Lane , and asked me to put up his Horse , and give him a Quartern of Oates , a Rack full of Hay , and a Penn'orth of Beans . I went for the Corn , and when I return 'd , I found my Master and the Prisoner bargaining for the Horse , - a black Gelding , blind of an Eye . I did not see the Horse in Mr. Hinton 's Possession . Mr. Hinton . The Horse I found in Davis 's Possession , was the same that I lost . John Hill . The Prisoner brought a black Gelding to my Master 's , - the Rose Inn , in Smithfield , the 16th of this Month , and order 'd me to put him up , and bait him . After some little Time , he order 'd him into the Market , to be sold ; and he rid about the Market accordingly . I heard that Mr. Hinton had lost two Horses , and had found one of them again ; so I went and told him , I believed I could help him to his other Horse , and he went with me to see him , and claim 'd him . Upon this , I found out the Prisoner , and took him . Defence . I know nothing at all about these Horses . Hinton . The Prisoner 's Father and Mother are very honest People : I do n't desire he should be hang 'd . Guilty , Death . 13.

My Wife keeps a Sale-Shop , and carries on that Trade for me : The Goods were mine , and were lost out of the Shop . Jane Draper . I have but little to say to the Girl : I did not find the Goods on her , but on the Woman that bought it of her . I took her up , but she is bail 'd out by Harris the Officer , in Rose-Mary-Lane , a Thief Catcher , I think they say he is . The Girl stole it to be sure , for I lost this Gown , and six more ; she own 'd she stole this , and I found it upon Margaret Poland , otherwise Irish Peg . Phillis Weldon . I have nothing to say to the Prisoner ; but I saw the Gown in Irish Peg 's Lap . Mary Dean . I have nothing to say against the Prisoner ; the Gown was found upon Irish Peg . When the Girl was before the Justice , she own 'd that Peg gave her 6 s. and 6 d. for it , and told her , that she would buy of her whatever she should get . This Accessary is out upon Bail ; for Mr. Warrener , ( Justice Farmer 's Clerk ) said , the Thief-takers would never let him alone till she was bail 'd . I believe the Child is an honest Child , only she was drawn in by this Jade . Thomas Welch . I am the Child 's Father-in-Law . I marry 'd her Mother with three of them , and she lives with us . I help sometimes to break up Ships ; sometimes I am a Lath-bender , or a Porter , and sometimes I buy my Wood at the best Hand , and cut it out into Matches . She was sent out that Day to sell two Bundles , the Day this happen 'd . Her Mother is a Stay-Maker , and the Girl is as honest a Girl as ever the Sun shin 'd upon . Mrs. Dean . I never saw the Girl in my Life , till she was before the Justice ; but the People that were about her , said she was an honest sober Girl . Irish Peg told us , she gave the Girl 6 s. 6 d. for it ; - I would give a Guinea for it , to make my Money of it again . Another Witness declar 'd she never heard an ill Character of the Girl , all the Days of her Breath . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 16. Margaret Poland , of St. Mary , Whitechappel , otherwise Margaret the Wife of James Mayfield ; otherwise Margaret the Wife of James Tweed , otherwise Irish Peg , otherwise Margaret the Wife of John Fosset , otherwise Margaret the Wife of Charles Poland , was indicted , for that Mary Haley , having stolen a flower 'd Mantua Silk Gown , value 23 s. May 29 , the Goods of Thomas Draper , in his Shop , she the said Poland , the same did receive , knowing it to be stolen , May 29 . The Record of Haley 's Conviction was read . Thomas Draper deposed as in the foregoing Trial . Jane Draper . On the 29th of May I had six Gowns stole out of my Shop , all at once ; upon which I went down Rosemary-Lane , to describe them to the Shop-keepers , and there I saw the Prisoner delivering the Gown out of her Apron to another Person , in a Hugger Mugger Manner . I charg 'd the Prisoner with having got my Goods ; D - mn your Eyes ( said she ) did you see any with me ? I told her yes , and went for an Officer ; when I return 'd , she was gone ; but I found her in Harris , the Thief-taker 's House , who is her Bail . She was eating with Harris 's Wife , and as soon as she saw me , she d - mn 'd my Eyes , and ask 'd me what I could prove against her ? I told her , I had seen my Goods upon her . But what ( says she ) can you prove upon me now ? I took hold of her , and tho ' she beat me and bit me , I got her into an Alehouse ; and there she said , I should not have the Gown , unless I gave her the Money ; at last she sent for it , but would not deliver it , till I had paid her for it . Then she went out , and returned with Harris the Constable ; now d - mn you ( says she ) charge him with me , or I will charge him with you . Harris asked me if I had got a Warrant ? I told him no ; then lay down the Goods , says he . I did so , and he bid the Prisoner take them up , which she did , and fell to tearing it , and wiping the Table with it , telling me it was her own , and d - mn her Eyes , she would do what she pleas 'd with it . When she was before the Justice , she cry 'd and begg 'd for two or three Days Liberty , that she might find out the Thief . I gave a Week , and at the End of that Time she brought the Girl to me . I look 'd at the Girl , and said , I was sorry if she was guilty , for I have Children of my own . The Girl is a poor Match-Girl , and 't is not likely she should have such a Gown to dispose of fairly , for 6 s. 6 d. The Prisoner I have seen standing in the Street with common Thieves ; and she liv 'd with a noted Thief , one Fosset , and sold the Goods he stole . Prisoner . You know you have got two Husbands in the Lane ; pray do you know that I have as many Husbands as you have laid in the Indictment ? Draper . Not so many Husbands , - but a hundred Fellows . You had two but the Night before . Phillis Waldon . I saw the Prisoner have the Gown in her Lap . Prisoner . I own it ; I bought it fairly in the open Street . Mary Dean . I live near the Place which the Creature , and the Thieves she deals with , frequent . There were two Fellows hang 'd for her , a little while ago . I saw her have the Gown in her Apron , and 't was worth 20 s. to have sold it again . I keep a Shop myself . William Adams , Constable . I took Charge of the Girl , and had her before the Justice , where she own 'd she stole the Gown . Prisoner . The Girl came down the Street , with the Gown upon her Arm , and said it was to be sold . I bid her 5 s. 6 d. and 6 s. for it . At last I told her , if she would bring any Body to say it was honestly come by , I would give her 6 s. and 6 d. for it . When I offer 'd it to Sale , I ask 'd no more than 8 s. and 6 d. for it . The Girl told me she liv 'd in East-Smithfield , and that her Mother was just gone down Rag Fair ; she went after her , to bring her to me , and I follow 'd her , but the People told me , I need not scruple it , for the Girl was very honest . When they claim 'd it , I offer 'd it them for 6 s. and 6 d. - I was not willing to lose so much Money ; but I did lose it , and a Shilling beside , for the Discharge of the Warrant . The Husband of the Woman beat and abused me , and when they were inform 'd I was going to Law with them , they arrested me for 4 l. 10 s. I got Bail , and the next Day they took me up upon this Affair . Eliz . Sturt . The Prisoner bought this Gown in Rosemary-Lane , and that 's a Place to buy such Things in . She agreed to give the Girl 6 s. 6 d. for it , if she could tell her whose it was . The Girl said 't was her Mother 's , and that she liv 'd in East Smithfield , and was just gone down Rosemary-Lane . The Prisoner offer 'd it me for 8 s. She said it was worth more for the Credit and Service 'twould do . My Husband is an Instrument-maker in Rosemary Lane . Mary Clark . The Prisoner gave 6 s. 6 d. for it , and went down the Fair to call her Mother ; but she returned , and said , her Mother was taken sick , and was gone out of the Fair , so the Prisoner gave her the Money . Jere . Listen . I keep an Alehouse in Rosemary-Lane . When the Girl was taken , Mrs. Draper was sent for ; so ( said she to the Girl ) you little B - ch , is it you that have robbed me ? and turning to the Prisoner , she said , - Peg , I am not willing to do the Girl any harm , for I do n't know what my own Children may come to ; and when we come before the Justice , I wo n't say any Thing , nor do n't you , Peg . Sarah Bell , and Ann Dobson , spoke to the same Effect with Mary Clark . Elizabeth Goughton gave the Prisoner a good Character , and confirm 'd some Part of Lister 's Evidence . Nathaniel Harris , Constable . I had the Prisoner before Mr. Justice Farmer , and she was discharged at the Request of Mrs. Draper . She said then , - We are all Dealers in a publick Way ; and they do buy of Children that are sent out with Things I have seen Children of 8 or 9 Years old sell Things of considerable Value . When she was taken up a 2d Time , she said , - we are all subject to buy Things in this misfortunate Way , I have done it myself ; and I should not have troubled myself about it , if Mr. Andrews had not sent me a Letter , to inform me he had Orders to sue me for an Assault ; but if any one attempts to put out one of my Eyes , I will put out one of theirs . John Brown . The Gown to be sure is worth more than she gave for it ; and our Dealers wo n't give above half Value for Things 'T is worth more Money than I can 'praise it to ; in our Business I think 't is worth about eight Shillings . Acquitted . 17. , of St. Anne 's , Westminster , was indicted for stealing an Axe , value 7 d. a spike Gimblet , value 2 d the Goods of John Strong . A Handsaw , value 2 s. a smoothing Plane , value a 2 d. and other Tools , the Goods of . And 9 lb . of leaden Pipe , value 9 d. the Goods of John Welbeloved , June 18 . Acquitted . 18. Godfrey Walker , of St. Luke 's Middlesex , was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on the 25th of May , on John Pike , feloniously did make an Assault , and with a certain Hatchet made of Steel , value 6 d. and which he held in both his Hands , on the fore Part of the Head , of the said Pike , feloniously did strike , giving him a mortal Wound and Bruise , of which from the said 25th of May , to the 11th of June , he languished , and languishing liv 'd and then dy 'd . He was a 2d Time charged by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest , for the said Murder . - Birkenhead . I had a Warrant from Justice Wroth , to execute upon the Prisoner , and Mr. Pike ( the Deceased ) being Headborough , I carry 'd it to him , - I got this Warrant for him because he would have stabb 'd me in the Back with his Bayonet , - there , - there he stands , - let him deny it if he can ; - d - mn you , says he , I will kill you , - aye , that , - that 's the Man , - there he stands , - that 's the Man that would have kill 'd me . And so I got a Warrant for him , and gave it Mr. Pike , and when we went to the Prisoner 's House , - there he stands , - that 's the Man , - he said G - d d - n you , I will murder the first Man that comes in . The Door stood a little o'jar , and I saw him within , and said to Mr. Pike , - there 's your Prisoner ; I was got into the House ; Mr. Pike was just behind me ; and he ( the Prisoner ) cry 'd out , G - d d - n your Bl - d I will murder you both , by G - d ; then he made a Motion with his Hand , - I suppose he had the Axe in it , but I did not see it , and Mr. Pyke said , - he has done my Business . God forbid , says I , and I was so surprized , that I could not take Notice of what he had in his Hand , and the poor Man bled prodigiously . I only saw the Prisoner make a Motion , - Truth is Truth . Councel . Was any body near you , when the Thing was done ? Birkenhead . I ca n't say , - the Mob came so fast upon us : I ca n't really say , - the Street-Door was open , but the Prisoner 's Shop was shut , 't was between 9 and 10 o'Clock . After Mr. Pike was hurt , we came to my House , and there the Wound was wash 'd with Vinegar and Loaf-Sugar ; from thence we went to the Cock , and Justice Worth was there , and Doctor Godman , and he dress 'd the Man 's Head . Councel . Whereabout was the Wound , and how did it appear ? Brickenhead . I ca n't say where it was ; I did not look upon it , - I do n't love to look upon Wounds , but I clean 'd his Wig . And I am sure the Door was open , when we went in , - as sure as that God made the World . Councel . Did the Deceased tell the Prisoner when he went in , that he had a Warrant ? Brickenhead . I ca n't say I heard that . I heard him say something , but I ca n't say he told him that . I saw the Deceased several Times before he died , and he always complain 'd of a Dizziness in his Head . The Warrant was read . Birkenhead . Pike was a Headborough in St. Luke 's and this happen 'd in that Parish . Ann Desborough . I heard the Out-cry of the People , that the Constable was coming to take the Prisoner , so I ran to bid him shut the Door ; but I found Birkenhead with his Back against the Door , and making Room for the Deceased to get in . As soon as he entered ; he spoke to the Prisoner , I saw him put his Hand toward the Window , and strike the Deceased with something large , but I ca n't tell what , for 't was dark , and tho ' there was a Candle , yet it gave but glimmering Light . I observ 'd the Stroke to fall upon his Head , and he said , he had done his Business , and flung the Blood out of his Neck with his Hands . Counc . Did you hear the Prisoner say any Thing ? Desborough . No , I was so frighted , that as soon as ever I got away I swooned . Prisoner to Birkenhead . Did not Mr. Pike agree to make it up for a Guinea ? Birkenhead . I told Mr. Pike that the Prisoner wanted to make it up , and asked him how he found himself ? He said , he had a great Dizziness in his Head . I advised him to make it up , if he was nothing detrimented , and the Prisoner came to me about it , but the Deceased said neither off , nor on . Geo Pike . The Deceased was my Brother . He had not been out of his House above half an Hour , but News was brought Home that he was murder 'd : He came in all over Blood , which came from his Head , and said he was hurt worse than we imagin 'd , and that he was afraid it would be his Death . He had a large Cut upon his Head , but I ca n't say upon what Part , for I was busy to and fro in the House . Councel . Did he say who gave him the Wound ? Pike . I did not hear him that Night , but I remember he said it was the Prisoner , on the 7th of June ; and that the Blow would be the Occasion of his Death . He died on the 11th , he was very well in Health before this happen 'd , and nothing ail 'd him no more than ails me now . Richard Sims . About two Nights after the Accident , the Deceased told me , the Blow which the Prisoner gave him when he went to serve the Warrant on him , he believed would be his Death , for ( says he ) my Head is all on Fire . Councel . Did he tell you with what Instrument the Wound was given ? Sims . He said the Prisoner took up an Axe , or a Hatchet , and threw at him . Eliz Loveit . The same Night the Murder was committed , I stood at my Door near the Prisoner 's . My Door is No 2. and he lives at No . 3 . I saw him come to the Door with a Hatchet in his Hand about 10 o'Clock , and he stamp 'd with his Foot , and said , this Night I am bent to do Murder . Francis Robinson . I am a Surgeon and an Apothecary , and serv 'd my Time in the Country with a Practitioner in both Ways . The Night the Coroner 's Inquest sat upon the Body of the Deceased , I went in and call 'd for half a Pint of Two-penny . Hearing the Jury had brought in their Verdict-Natural Death , I desir 'd to see the Body , and upon searching the Head , I found a Wound , and a Caedes on the left Side of the Sagittal Suture . There was a Caedes , a simple Fracture , the Skull was broke ; and there was the Print of the Weapon just upon the Cranium . I pointed to the Place , and said , I believ 'd that Blow was the Cause of the Man 's Death . The Cranium was not crack 'd , 't was not a Fissure , but the Skull was dented inwards . I improperly call 'd it that Night a Fissure , but it was more properly a Caedes , and the Periostium must be broke to be sure , and this will occasion an Inflammation , and St. Anthony 's Fire , if proper Care be not taken . I believe he died of the Blow . The Body was all mortify 'd and black , when I saw it , and the Man had been dead 3 Days . Ann Longdon , deposed , she heard the Deceased say , on the 25th of May , that the Prisoner had struck him with an Axe , that she saw a great quantity of Blood about his Head , and that she heard him declare the Blow would be his Death . - Holdwright was in the Entry of the Prisoner 's House when the Fact was done , and he deposed , that the Deceased had not been 3 Minutes in the House before he cry 'd out Murder ; when he came out he said , he believed the Prisoner had given him his Death 's Wound . Eliz . Chidsdell . I nursed him when he kept his Room , he always complained of his Head , and would say , that Night 's Work would be his Death . He was not sick , but cry 'd out only his Head , his Head , and Lord have Mercy upon me , my Head is distracted . We have moved his Pillows 20 Times in a Night . He took his Bed the 2d of June , and died the 11th . The Wound was heal 'd up before I came to him , but I think he died of the Disorder in his Head , for his Head and Face were swell 'd to a very violent Degree with the St. Anthony 's Fire . Tho Godman , Surgeon . On the 25th of May , the Deceased came to me , and I examin 'd the Wound . I remov 'd the Blood , and the Hair , and found a superficial Wound , I applied a Tonsil of Lint , and put on a common Plaister . I saw no more of him till Saturday se'ennight , or fortnight after ; I was then sent for by Order of Dr. Hall to bleed him . When I bled him , he had a violent St. Anthony's-Fire upon him , and after I had blooded him , I look 'd at the Wound , and it was well . The next Day I was sent for to bleed him again , and found the Tumor on his Head and Face began to subside ; but then he began to complain of a Difficulty in Breathing : I took my Leave of him , and the next Day he died . After his Death , I laid the Skull bare , in the Presence of Mr. Hicks of Hatton-Garden , and we found no Injury done to the Skull . As to the Gentleman 's Remarks on a Caedes , I do n't know what he means ; a Caedes is when a Print of the Weapon is left . We never had any Symptom of a Fracture of the Cranium , nor of a Concussion upon the Brain . Councel . You never open 'd the Cranium , to see if the Brain was injur 'd . Can not the Brain receive an Injury , without any outward Appearance of Hurt ? Mr. Godman . Yes ; but then there will be the Symptoms of that Injury , Vomiting , Drowsiness , & c. I ca n't take upon me to say the Blow was the Cause of his Death . Councel . You ca n't say it was not . Mr. Hicks . I inspected the Skull , when 't was laid bare , but I saw nothing of any Fracture or Depression . The Skull was not laid open , because it is judg 'd to be unnecessary where there has been no Bleeding at the Nose , or Ears , no Comus , nor any of the Symptoms of a fractur 'd Skull . I never saw the Man alive , but upon Enquiry , I could not find he had had any such Symptoms . I ca n't say the Wound was the Occasion of his Death ; it might bring on sooner the Symptoms of the St. Anthony 's Fire . Mr. Snowd was of the same Opinion , and he imagined Mr. Robinson might mistake a Suture in the Cranium for the Caedes , which he said he saw . And tho ' it was not impossible for a Blow on that Place to cause Death , yet in such a Case the Symptoms must have come on sooner . John Burrows . On Friday , after the Wound was given , I was sent for to the Deceased , and found him in a violent Fever , and an Inflammation was begun on the lower Part of his Face , Jaws , and Cheeks ; and he had all the Symptoms of a St. Anthony 's Fire . I gave him proper Remedies , but the next Day the Swelling was increas 'd , to so violent a Degree , that he could not see out of his Eyes , and his Face was as big as two Mens . His Fever was decreas 'd , because the Humours were flown outward . On the Wednesday he could not be persuaded to keep his Bed , but went out of one Room into another ; and that might throw in again the Humour , which should have perspir 'd off . So his Fever increasing again the next Day , Doctor Hall was call 'd in , and he order 'd Bleeding and Blistering . The Wound was cur 'd before I attended him . He complain 'd of a violent pricking Pain , and a shooting in his Head ; and said , he had had a Blow from the Prisoner , but I did not hear him say that was the Occasion of his Death . Thomas Hayward , and Anthony Dod , Serjeants , gave the Prisoner the Character of as quiet a Fellow as any they had in the Regiment . Guilty , Death . 19. Benjamin Read , of St. Mary , White-chappel , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-House of John Chettle , between 2 and 3 in the Night , and stealing three Linnen Shirts , value 8 s. two Holland Shirts , value 5 s. and a Linnen Table-Cloth , value 2 s. the Goods of Martha Lawton , May 30 . Martha Lawton . I live in Mr. Chettle 's House , on Little Tower Hill , some call it Rosemary-Lane . On the 29th of May , at Night , my Shop was shut up fast ; the out-side Bar was put up by another Person , and I key 'd the Pins . About 2 o'Clock , as I lay a Bed , I heard a Tugging at the Shutters , and I said to my Daughter , who was a Bed with me , that some Body was getting into the House . I listen 'd till the Watchman came by , and then I was satisfy 'd ; for as the Noise did not cease when he came along , I thought 't was some Cats might be lock 'd into the Shop . So I laid myself down again to sleep , but presently I heard a Bounce , open flew the Casement of my Chamber Window . O my dear , says I , they are coming in at the Window ! Lord have Mercy upon me , says she , and so they are ; and she got up and shut the Window again : Then there was a little sort of a Silence , but in a little while we heard the Noise again ; then I got up , and went up Stairs to call a young Man that lay in the House , and as we were going down Stairs , a young Woman knock 'd at the Door , and told us our Shop was broke open . We found the Bar broke , the inner Bolt unfasten 'd , and three check 'd Shirts , two white ones , and a Table cloth , were taken from the Shelves next the Window . The young Woman that knock 'd at the Door told us , she saw the Man draw the Things out of the Window , and she described him to us ; she said he had a green Waistcoat on ; a red Jacket , and a Pair of Towsers . My Washerwoman hearing this Description , directed us to a Cellar where such Out of-the-way Fellows resorted , at all Hours of the Night , and told us , there was one of them that she knew answered the Description . William Griggs . The Prisoner and I broke open this Woman 's House on the 30th of May last , with this Ripping-chissel , about two o'Clock in the Morning ; the End of it was broke off by wrenching the Bar down . He put his Hand in , and took out three check 'd Shirts , two white ones and a Table-cloth , and gave them to me The white ones I carry 'd , and he carry 'd the check 'd ones himself ; in the Morning he sent his Wife out with the three check 'd Shirts and the Table cloth to pawn ; we kept a white Shirt a piece , and the rest being pawn 'd for 4 s. 6 d. we had each of us 2 s. and 3 d. Prisoner . I never saw this Fellow before in my Life . Griggs . We liv 'd both together in the same House . Prisoner . I never saw him before he swore against me . Griggs . We liv 'd together two Months in Mrs. Trantum 's Cellar , in Rosemary Lane . Mr. Harris and Mr. Gribble , took us both out of this Cellar ; - they broke open the Door upon us . Nathaniel Harris . The Thursday after the Robbery , Mr. Richardson told me there were some House breakers conceal 'd in a Cellar ; so I went , and with difficulty got the Door open , and took the Prisoner and this Griggs . When they were before the Justice , Griggs desired he might be admitted an Evidence ; and the Prisoner pray 'd likewise that the Justice would make him the Evidence ; for ( said he ) I can hang five for the Scamp ; that is , for Robberies on the Highway ; and he mentioned one or two , that he had been concerned in , in Stepney Fields , and said , that Griggs had only been out with him in Housebreaking . When the Justice had admitted Griggs 's Evidence , the Prisoner told him he had not put all their Facts into his Information . The Prisoner was admitted an Evidence himself about 2 Years ago . Prisoner . Ask him if ever he saw me with this Fellow in his Life : Harris . The Day before the Prisoner committed this Robbery , I met him and Fanny Read , and the Evidence and his Wife , upon Ludgate-Hill , by Ashley 's Punch House . Martha Cuttiford gave the same Account with her Mother ( the first Witness ) adding , that Mrs. Trantum told her , the Prisoner and the Accomplice were dancing with their Women , 'till Two o'Clock in the Morning , and then they went out ; and that when they were taken , the young Woman who saw the Burglary committed , being with them , they cry 'd , - dear young Woman , - we are young Men , - do n't go to take our Lives away . She said farther , that while the 2 Men were before the Justice , the white Shirts and the Chissel were brought in . Mary Miller . I saw the Prisoner take the Things through a Hole in the Window , and give them to this Accomplice ; I informed the People of the House of what I had seen , and was at the Cellar when they were taken from thence into Custody . They beg 'd I would not swear against them , nor take away their Lives . I am positive the Prisoner is one of them : He had the same Cloaths on then , which he stands in now , only he had a Bird 's ey 'd Handkerchief on at that Time . I never saw them before that Time in my Life . Before they took the Goods , I saw them at the Tavern Bench , in Queen-Street . Thomas Gribble . I was at the taking the Prisoner and the Evidence out of the Cellar ; there 's a Trap Door to it , which we forced open , and found the two Men and two Women . While we were at the Justices , the Man at the Fourteen Stars brought two of the Shirts to us . Martha Cuttiford declared further , that the Prisoner told her , he knew he should be hang 'd , and that he did not value his Life , but only on his Wife 's and Mother 's Account . Robert Tuck confirm 'd Harris 's Evidence . Prisoner . This Harris wanted me to make myself an Evidence , but I refus 'd , and told him I knew nothing of the Matter . He has been with me several Times in Newgate , and would have given me Money to swear Peoples Lives away . I beg George Greenaway ( a Prisoner ) may be call 'd , and ask 'd whether he has not seen Harris several Times with me ? Greenaway . Harris , and a little Man that is a Butcher , and Tom Sylvan , came and talked to the Prisoner , but I do n't know what they said to him . Ann French . The Prisoner liv 'd with me , and from the first of May to the last , he was never out of my House , any farther than the Garden . I know it , because I was always at Home , and never was out of the House myself . Councel . Why did not he live in Trantum 's Cellar ? French . Yes ; but that was after May . The 29th and the 30th of May he was never out of the House He had been sick , and went abroad the first of June . Counc . What Distance is Trantum 's Cellar from your House ? French . I live at Poplar , Trantum I know nothing of , I am his Mother . Margaret Cudlick , Eliz Palmer , Catherine Brown , and Abraham Izard , gave the Prisoner a good Character . Guilty , Death . 20. George Grinway , otherwise Greenaway , was indicted for assaulting John Goodwin , Clerk , on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Guinea , and 8 s. in Silver , May 15 . He was a 2d Time indicted for stealing a Gelding of a Brown Colour , value 4 l. a Leather Bridle and Saddle , value 5 s the Goods of Jude Storer , May 25 Jude Storer . On the 27th of April last , in the Night Time , my Stable was broke open , and I lost a Horse , a Saddle and Bridle ; some Time afterwards I saw in an Advertisement , that a Man and Horse were taken on Account of Mr. Goodwin 's being robb 'd , and I went to Laylam to see the Horse , and it prov 'd to be mine . Robert Taylor . I saw the Prisoner upon the Horse at Belfount in Middlesex , he went in at the Half-Moon , a little Ale-house in the Parish Robert Chandler On the 15th of May , I heard that Mr. Goodwin was robb 'd , and that the Highway-man was at the Half Moon , I went up thither , and finding his Horse to answer the Description that was given me of him , I took the Prisoner , and found 3 loaded Pistols upon him . The Horse was advertised , and Mr. Storer came and claimed it . The Prisoner all the Time he was in Custody , insisted upon it , that the Horse was his own , and that he had bought it for 2 Guineas at Fulham Bridge . The Rev . Mr. Goodwin . On the 15th of May , about 7 o'Clock in the Morning , I was attack 'd by a Highway-man upon Hounslow Heath , between the Powder-Mills and the Town of Hounslow , who took from me a Guinea , and about 8 s. I believe the Prisoner is the Man ; he was mounted on a Horse about 15 Hands high , that went at a great Rate , and had Leather Bags behind him . He came on the Broad-side of me , and would hardly give me Leave to put my Hands in my Pockets , but was in great Haste , and search 'd me himself . I had Leisure to view the Horse 's Back-side , and when my Neighbours had taken the Prisoner , I went to see the Horse , and knew him again . Upon this Sir Tho Reynolds committed him . The Horse and the Bags being advertised , Storer came and claimed the Horse , and one Gauntlet of Stockbridge own 'd the Bags , and that his Name , ( almost worn out ) was upon them . I ca n't recollect every Particular of what the Prisoner said when he was taken at the Half-Moon , but the Substance was , - he desir 'd to speak to me alone . So old , as I am , I did not think it right to be left alone with him ; for tho ' they had taken from him 3 loaded Pistols , and some Powder and Balls , or Slugs , yet I was doubtful whether he might not have-a Penknife ; but the Constable assuring me he had no Weapons we retir 'd , and the Man fell into a great Agony , and put me into one too ; for there were some Circumstances in his robbing me , that made me pity him . He told me he was Heir to 5 or 600 a Year , and that he had a Brother a Clergyman at Stamford , whose Name was Sawyer , and he was sure I would let him go , if I was to see his Brother , or any of his Relations at Reading . I thought this might be his first Flight ; for I remember 'd , when he came a Broad Side of me , and thrust his Head and Pistol into my Chaise , he trembled , and could not hold his Pistol still . I thought at first he did this in Terrorem , and to make me dispatch , but before he had done with me , I perceiv 'd his left Leg to shake , and then I concluded he was but a young Beginner , and was frighted . I thought he came out from under a Hedge , on the North Side of the Road , where the Soldiers lie in wait for a Prize , - Highway-men , I mean , - but he said No , he did not come from thence , I came by you when you was smoaking your Pipe in the Chaise ; - by the same Token , I remember he broke it , and I had a good Mind to have thrown it in his Face . I had a Guinea in my Pocket wrapp 'd up in Brown Paper , and he own 'd to me that he took it so wrapp 'd up . Prisoner . What Reason have you to believe I am the Man ? Mr. Goodwin . Several . First , my Man swears positively to the Horse that he rode to the Half-Moon on , and I believe it to be the same . Another Reason is , his Manner of dealing with me . I do n't know that he swore above an Oath or two . My Man carelesly look 'd over his Shoulder while he was rifling me , and he damn 'd him , and told him he would shoot him , if he did not put his Head aside . I reason 'd with him , and told him , - none of you Gentlemen ever offer 'd to rob me before , tho ' no one has travell 'd Hounslow-Heath more than I have done . That 's nothing says he , I am in Want , and Money I must have , and you can draw Bills for more . So he did not leave me a Farthing , ( tho ' I had two Turnpikes to go thro ' ) except one 6 d. which had dropp 'd between us to the Bottom of the Chaise . Prisoner . What Habit was I in ? Mr. Goodwin . Yes ; that is another Reason I believe you are the Man . 'T was in the Summer Time , and he had a great Coat on , that was too big for him ; while he attack 'd me , he shook , and his Coat Sleeve being too long , he turn 'd it up . In my Conscience I believe him to be the very Man . When I saw him at the Constable 's House , at Belfount , his Coat was put upon him , and his Hat , at my Request ; and he appear 'd to me , when his little Hat was pull 'd over his Eyes , just as he did when he robb 'd me . He told me I should have my Money again , if I would let him go . I told him I could not answer doing that ; and that he had a good deal of Confidence and Assurance , to rob me within a Mile of the House where he lay , and to return after the Robbery in the same Habit into the Town . John Roseblade , Mr. Goodwin 's Servant , confirm 'd his Master 's Evidence , and said , he could swear positively to the Horse ; but had no Opportunity to view the Highway-man 's Face . He took Notice that the Horse had a Star in his Forehead , and that both his Knees were broke . - Blake , was with Mr. Footit the Constable , when the Prisoner was taken ; he said , they found three loaded Pistols upon him , a Silver Watch in his Fob , a Snuff-Box , a Silver Nutmeg-grater , 10 or 11 Shillings in Money , and some Powder and Slugs . - Footit , the Constable , depos 'd to the same Effect ; and that the Prisoner answer 'd the Description exactly that Mr. Goodwin had given of him , and that he saw him upon the Heath , before the Robbery was committed . George Rook swore he saw a Man exactly like the Prisoner upon the Heath , that Morning , driving a Horse before him , which he believed was the same the Prisoner rode upon at that Time . William Prior , a Servant at the Bell , at Belfount , swore , That the Prisoner went out from thence about Six in the Morning , and came in again about Nine ; that the Horse the Prisoner rode , was the same that was claim 'd by Mr. Storer ; and that he himself brought him out of the Stable to the Prisoner that Morning . Defence . I was at the Cross-Keys at Colebrook till Breakfast-Time , that Morning the Robbery was committed , and I expected the People of the House would have been here . Thomas Camplin had known the Prisoner from his Infancy , and never knew him guilty of any bad Action . He inform 'd the Court , that his Father , Uncle , and all his Relations live at Reading , or there about . That he has an Uncle at Reading , one William Greenaway , reputed worth more than 600 per Annum ; that the Prisoner marry 'd the Daughter of Mr. Young , a Currier , at Newbury , and that by Occupation he was a Bargeman ; but he could not say how he had liv 'd of late .

William Newington , of London , Gent . was indicted for falsely making , and forging , and causing to be made and forg 'd , in the Name of Thomas Hill , a Paper Writing , purporting in itself an Order for the Payment of 120 l. - which Order is contained in the Words and Abbreviations following . Sir Fra . Child and Comp . Pray pay unto Sir Rowland Hill , Bart . or Bearer , the Sum of One Hundred and Twenty Pounds , and place it to the Account of SIR , To Sir Fra . Child , and Comp . Temple-Bar . Your Humble Servant , Thomas Hill . With an intent to defraud Sir Francis Child , Samuel Child , John Morse , and Barnaby Bakewell , of the said Sum . June 27 . The Indictment farther charged the Prisoner with assisting in making and forging the said Order . June 27 . And likewise with uttering and publishing the said Note , knowing it to be false , forg 'd and counterfeit . June 27 . * * Note . We are obliged for want of Room , to refer the Reader for the Form of this Indictment , to Cross 's Trial ; Sessions Book , No . 5 . P. 89 . Erratum , in that Indictment , line the 13 , for Car . read Cross . The Councel for the Prosecution observ 'd to the Jury , that the Indictment charged the Prisoner with three Sorts of Offences , viz With making and forging the Note . With assisting in the making and forging it ; and with uttering and publishing it , knowing it to be forg 'd and counterfeit ; every one of which Species of Forgery was by a late Act punishable with Death . And tho ' all the three Offences were charged upon the Prisoner , yet , if he should be so unhappy as to fall under the Proof of any of them , it would be equally fatal to him . And that whoever consider 'd the wild Havock , Forgery was capable of making among the Properties of Mankind , would cease wondering that the Law should so severely punish it , and rather be surprised that this Punishment was not annex 'd to the Crime , by the antient Laws of the Land ; for if the Breach of other Laws of Society is punish 'd with Death , how much less punishment is that Crime worthy of , that tends to destroy all Commerce . It was farther observ 'd , that this Species of Robbery was the very worst that a Man could be guilty of , for a Person might guard against private Robbers , by caution ; against publick ones , by Strength ; but against Forgery , no Vigilance could protect ; no Strength could defend . And , That it was matter of Concern , to see One so young in Years , capable of being charged with a Crime of this Nature , & c. & c. John Holloway , Porter . The Prisoner at the Bar , sent me with the Note , from Child 's Coffee-House in St. Paul 's Church-Yard . He took it out of a Pocket Book , and wrote something on the Back of it , then he gave it to me , to carry to Sir Francis Child 's , and to receive 120 l. for him . I was to have 3 d. and no more . Accordingly I carry 'd it as I was order 'd by the Prisoner , and gave it to a Gentleman in the Shop : He shew 'd it to others , and they all seem 'd to be in a little sort of a Study ; after which they told me , I might go , but they believ 'd the Note was not good . I desired them to give me the Note again , and send somebody with me to the Coffee-House , where the Gentleman that gave it me , waited for my return . They did not send any body with me , so I came alone to the Coffee-House , but the Gentleman was gone , and had left Word that he was gone to the Faculty Office , in Doctor's-Commons . I went thither , and enquired for him by the Name of Caesar ( because that Name was put on the Back of the Note ) but I could not find him . About 2 or 3 Hours after , my Father told me a Gentleman wanted me at the Horn and Feathers , in Carter Lane . I went thither and told the Prisoner the Note was stopp 'd ; then stay here ( says he ) 'till I put my Shoes on , and I will go back with you . I waited there and about the Place two or three Hours , but he came back no more . Councel . Look at this Note . Holloway . This is the very Note , I know it by the Writing ; - here 's Julius Caesar , Doctors Commons upon the Backside There was this Endorsement upon it , when I carry 'd it . I saw him write something upon it , when he gave it me ; what it was , I could not tell , but I look 'd at it as I went along . Prisoner . Was all that Endorsement upon it , when you carry 'd it to Sir Francis Child ? Holloway . I observ 'd Julius Caesar , Doctors Commons upon it . John Burbeck . This is the same Note , that the Porter brought to me . All the Endorsement was then on the Back and nothing else . Councel . To Holloway . Was any Thing wrote upon it , after the Prisoner deliver 'd it you , to go for the Money ? Holloway . I was going to write my Name upon it , and had wrote John Hol - Here the Note was read . Sir Fra . Child and Comp . Pray pay to Sir Rowland Hill , Bart . or Bearer , One Hundred and Twenty Pounds , and place it to the Account of Your Humble Servant , To Sir Fra . Child and Comp . Temple-Bar . Tho . Hill . Endors 'd Julius Caesar , Doctors Commons . Councel . The Porter says , the Prisoner was preparing to come to your House about this Note ; pray did he ever come ? Mr. Burbeck . No . Mr. Gabriel Leaver . I have done Business for Mr. Tho . Hill , while the Prisoner was my Clerk ; I am well acquainted with his Hand , and do not believe this to be his Writing . I take the whole Body of the Note to be the Prisoner 's own Writing . The Words ( Tho . Hill ) and the Body of the Note , I take them to be all wrote by the same Hand ; and likewise the Endorsement on the Back . I believe them to be the Prisoner 's . I have compar 'd the Note with some Writing of his which I have at Home . Peter Mixer . I never saw the Prisoner before Tuesday the 27th of June last , between 11 and 12 o'Clock in the Forenoon , he came into Child 's Coffee-House , and wanting a Porter , I cal 'd Holloway to him , he asked whether we knew him ? I told him yes ; then he call 'd for Pen and Ink , and wrote something upon the Paper , which he deliver 'd to the Porter , after he had asked him his Name , and the Number of his Ticket . I believe it was the same he wrote upon , which he gave the Porter , but he had several other Papers in his Case . When the Porter was gone , I knew he was to bring Money , for he was no sooner out of the House , but the Prisoner asked me what Time the Faculty-Office would be shut up ? I looked at the Dial , and saw it wanted 20 or 30 Minutes to 12 , and told him the Office would shut up at 12 . Upon which he got up , and said , - if the Porter comes back , tell him I will be here again Presently , but he went away , and I saw no more of him . When the Porter returned , I told him the Gentleman was gone to the Faculty-Office , and about 2 o'Clock , Sir Francis 's Man came down with the Note . I directed him to the Porter , and heard no more of it till Wednesday Morning , then I heard the Man was taken , and saw the Note . Holloway . I was present when the Prisoner was taken . He was found the same Evening between 10 and 11 , at the Fountain Ale-house in Cheapside . Nothing passed between us till we got him to the Compter , but there I asked him how he could send me with such a Note ? He said he believed the Devil was in him ; and now he had nothing to do , but to make Friends to Mr. Thomas Hill , and he had Friends who would make it up at any Rate . His Mother , ( he said ) lived 60 Miles off in the Country . We found him out very easily ; Mr. Leaver told us his Name , and where he liv 'd , and when we saw him at the Fountain , he seemed in a Hurry , and said , - for God 's Sake do n't discover me , I will go with you Mr. Burbeck . When he was before Mr. Alderman Barber , he own 'd he sent the Note ; but he said he found it . Prisoner . I hope your Lordship will indulge me in asking the Porter a Question or two . Was the Note folded up , or open , when I deliver 'd it to you ? Holloway . He opened it , and shew 'd me what it was for ; then he folded it up , and gave it into my Hand . 'T was open when he bid me go to Sir Francis Child for 120 l. and come back presently , - he would stay for me . As I went along I open 'd it , and look 'd at it . Prisoner . He says , when I was taken at the Fountain , I seem 'd in a Hurry ; I had Opportunity to make my Escape . Ask him whether I did not come to him voluntarily ? Holloway . As soon as I came into the Room , and call 'd for Mr. Newington , he got up , and said here . He met me in the Room , and said , for God 's Sake make no Noise o n't , - or some such Words . Prisoner . I own I gave the Note to the Porter , but I found it on Ludgate-Hill , after 10 o'Clock , in this Pocket Book , and I immediately put it into my Pocket , and carry 'd it into St. Pauls Churchyard before I looked at it . I took all Occasions to inspect the Papers , to see if any Reward would be offered for it , and not finding it to be advertis 'd , I sent it by the Porter . Councel . Did you advertise it ? Prisoner . No . Then a Gentleman produc 'd a Letter which the Prisoner had sent him to borrow a Coat , and the Prisoner desired it might be compared with the Note , in Order to shew that the Hands were not alike ; but it was observ 'd , that if the Prisoner wrote the Note , he would necessarily disguise his own Hand , and endeavour to imitate Mr. Hill 's . Mr. Studley , Mr. Hunt , Mr. Hilder , Mr. Gosling , Mr. Warnet , Mr. Godman , Mr. Vaughan , Mr. Leaver , and Mr. Graves , gave the Prisoner a good Character ; some of them he had liv 'd with , and had been entrusted by them , in particular , by Mr. Leaver with 9000 l. and that he discharg 'd his Trust honestly .

Charles Matthewson . On Monday Evening , June the 12th , I was at Vauxhall , and got a little in Liquor ; but I remember I had a Guinea in my Pocket , beside-Silver , when I came on this Side the Water . The Prisoner ( I suppose ) pick 'd me up , and we went to a House-in Vinegar-Yard , by Russel Court . I was so much fuddled , that I did not know where I was , 'till the Landlord wak 'd me in my Chair the next Morning . He ask 'd me where the Woman was , that I came in with ? I told him I did not know the Woman that was with me ; I saw you had a Guinea and some Silver in your Pocket last Night , says he ; upon this I turn 'd out my Pockets , - but all my Money was gone , except a few Halfpence , which were scatter 'd about the Floor . The Landlord said , he knew her , but while we were talking about her , she came in , and he secur 'd her . I do n't swear to the Prisoner ; the Landlord told me , she was the Person . James Griffiths , Constable . Knowing the Prosecutor , and hearing of this unfortunate Story , - that he was at the Horse-shoe , in Russel-Court , Drury Lane , I went to the House , ( the Landlord 's Name is Rarisom ) and there I found the Landlord , the Prosecutor , and the Woman sitting together ; this was about 9 or 10 the next Morning . They were all jangling together , and I would have had her confess 'd the Money . Instead of that , she deny 'd she took any Money from him . The Landlord said , that the Prosecutor shew 'd him a Guinea and some Silver , when he came in , that he might not be afraid of his Reckoning . After a good many Words , she desired them to walk out , and she would speak to me ; for I am an Antient Briton , and she is the same . I persuaded her to confess , and at last she pull 'd out a Pair of Mittens , with 6 s. and 6 d. in them , which she confess 'd was the Property of the Prosecutor , and said she had no more . Then I carry 'd her before Justice Hilder ; and after he had examin 'd her , she was search 'd by his Maid and another Woman , and while her Rags were some off and some on , 6 d. dropp 'd from them , and another 6 d. was taken out of the Crown of her Head : But this Money , she said , was none of the Prosecutor 's . Upon this the Justice committed her to the Gatehouse . Prisoner . The Money I had about me , was my own ; I never was in Jail before in my Life . When they took me , I was frighted , and did not know what to say , or do . If I had had more Money about me , I should have let them have had it all . Acquitted . 38. Alice Gibson , of St. John , Wapping , was indicted for stealing a Silver Watch and Chain , value 3 l. a Steel Seal set in Brass , value 1 d. and three Guineas , the Property of David Burwood , in the Dwelling-House of John Gibson , June 16 . Burwood . I had been to see a Consort on Board a Ship , and came back very much in Liquor . So being in Liquor , I met this Woman about Eleven o'Clock ( last Friday 't was a Week ago ) and she carry 'd me to her House , over against Gun-Dock , and the we went to Bed : - Yes , I did lie with her all Night indeed ; and we drank 3 Bowls of Bembow before we went to Bed , - that , to be sure , did not make me a bit soberer than I was before . About Five in the Morning I'waked , and miss 'd my Bedfellow , that Party , there at the Bar , - and I found another Woman a-bed with me . My Watch and all my Money was gone , and another Party was in Bed . I am pretty sure there was but one Party a-bed with me at a Time . I am sure I had the Money with me when I came into this House ; for I call 'd at Mrs. Gaskin 's as I came along , to change a Guinea , and she had no Change . Gaskin . Aye , my Name is Gaskin . Burwood . I came from Mrs. Gaskin 's between 10 and 11 o'Clock , and Mrs. Gaskin 's House is not above half a Mile from the Prisoner 's , and I am sure I had my Watch and Money there . When I miss 'd them in the Morning , I never spoke to the Party that I found in Bed with me ; but I got up and went down Stairs , and asked the Prisoner for my Watch , telling her , - I thought the Money was enough , - without taking Watch and Money too . She told me , - truly I pawn 'd my Watch over-night for a Guinea . To whom ? says I : Why to myself , says she , as for your Money , I have none of it . - As to what we drank before we went to bed , - there was I , and there was she at the Bar , - and the other Party ; - we had a Sneaker of Bembow a-piece . The Prisoner told me , I should not have my Watch again , unless I paid her a Guinea ; - but I paid her none , - I went to the Justice and took a Warrant to search for my Watch ; and had her before the Justice ; she told the Justice I had pawn 'd the Watch for a Guinea to her , I told her I would give her the Guinea to have my Watch again ; and then she said she must go Home and fetch it ; but upon searching her in a publick House we found the Watch upon her . She said I deliver 'd it to her as a Pledge , but I am sure I never pull 'd it out of my Fob , while I was in her House . As to the Reckoning , there was 3 Shillings to pay , and as I had but three Guineas and one Shilling in my Pocket , I paid the Shilling for the first Bowl when it came in , - for 't is the Custom of those Houses to make People pay as Liquor comes in , but as I had no more Silver , they trusted me 'till Morning . Sarah Gaskin . Mr. Burwood is a Lodger of mine , and lay out that Night . When he came Home in the Morning , he told my Servants what had happened last Night , but he did not care I should know it . So he went to Mr. Edwards , the Headborough , and made his Complaint ; and they got a search Warrant , and a Warrant for the Prisoner . When she was before the Justice , she insisted upon it , that the Watch was pledg 'd to her , and refuss 'd to deliver it without Burwood paid her a Guinea : He agreed to that , and Justice Cross 's Clerk and the Constable went with her to fetch it ; but 't was a rainy Day , and they turn 'd into an Alehouse , where the Clerk felt under her Arm , and there was the Watch . Headborough . This is the Watch that was taken from her Person . When the Prisoner made his Complaint to me , I went with him to Justice Cross , and he granted us a search Warrant , and a special Warrant , and I went to serve it , at the Prisoner 's House . I asked her if she had not got the Man 's Watch ? She told me yes , and that the Man had pawn 'd it to her for a Guinea . He refuss 'd to pay the Guinea , so we carry 'd her before the Justice , and he committed her . She said she knew nothing of his Money , but she offered me the Watch to keep , 'till he paid the Guinea . Prisoner . Between 10 and 11 o'Clock that Night , I and another young Woman met the Prosecutor ; and he asked if he should go Home with us ? When we came Home , I asked him for Money : He said , he had no more than a Shilling and Two : pence Halfpenny ; the Shilling he gave to me , and I fetch 'd him Liquor for it . I asked him if he had any more Money ( when the Liquor was drank . ) He said no ; but he pull 'd out his Watch , and deliver 'd it to me on the Bed-side . Next Morning between 4 and 5 , he waked , and asked for the Watch . I told him I had it , and would give it him for a Guinea he had pledg 'd it for . He made no Answer , but went out ; and returned with another Man : I told them again , that there was 20 s. due upon it . Some of the Money was for Liquor , the rest I charge for his Night 's Lodging . Acquitted . 39. , was indicted for the Murder of her male bastard Child , by putting the Head of the said Child into a Chamber-pot , whereby it was instantly suffocated . June 6 .

Richard Marks , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for assaulting Joseph Pomeroy , on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him , a silver Watch , value 4 l. a Silver Chain . value 5 s. a Brass Seal , value 1 d. a Hat , value 4 s. a Peruke , value 15 s. and a Cane with a Brass Head , value 3 s. Nov. 9. Joseph Pomeroy . I do n't know the Prisoner , for I was very much in Liquor that Night . I had been at the Jerusalem Tavern , with some Friends that Night , and parted with them I do n't know where ; - but a little above the Watch-house , somebody shov 'd me down , or I fell down , I do n't know which ; so I went to the Watch-house , and told them I had lost my Hat and Cane and Whig ; and putting my Hand to my Pocket , I miss 'd my Watch . - Z - nds ! says I , ( I did say Z - nds ) I have lost my Watch too . I did not mind the Loss of any Thing but my Peruke , - for I was afraid of catching Cold , and getting deaf ; therefore I desired to come into the Watch-house ; the Watchmen opposed me , - Bl - d ! says I , I will come in , with that they sent me to - the Round house ; and because I would not pay the Watchmen a Shilling a-piece , they bound me over . The Watch was advertised , and I got it again ; and the Constable got the Cane . As to the Prisoner I know nothing of him . Richard Smitherman , Pawnbroker . I believe it was the 17th of November , the Prisoner brought the Watch to my House , to pawn , about 9 o'Clock in the Morning . He asked 3 Guineas upon it , I knew him to be a poor Fellow , and wonder 'd how he came by it ; therefore I asked him how he came by it ? He said he bought it at Mr. Hulet 's in Eagle Street ; I step 'd to Mr. Hulet 's , and he told me the Prisoner had bought no Watch of him . The Prisoner followed me to Mr. Hulet 's , and gave me ill Language , and would have had the Watch by Force from me . I told him before Mr. Hulet , if he could give any Account where he had it I would return it . Then he said he won it by Gaming at Temple-Bar , and would have it from me , and struggled with me for it , till we both fell down together ; then I offered a Shilling to any one that would fetch a Constable , upon which he went away , and got clear off ; but the Watch being advertised , the Prosecutor had it again . Some time afterward , the Prisoner was seen by Mr. Cross in the Street , he gave me Intelligence of him , I went up and took him , and sent for the Prosecutor . Pomeroy . When the Prisoner was before the Justice , he said I had a Woman with me in Holborn , and that I staid with her about a Minute ; then I made up ( he said ) towards the Watch-house , and there she pull 'd at my Watch , - and I pull 'd , and so it fell down : After which , he went to the Place and trod upon my Cane , stooping down for that ( he said ) he found the Watch . As for my Hat and Wig , he knew nothing of them . Now I can take an Oath that I had no Woman with me that Night . Mr. Justice Margets The Prisoner was brought before me , and behav 'd as impudently as ever I saw any one in my Life . He told me the Prosecutor had got a Whore , and fell down in a Sirreverence , and that after he had pick 'd himself up , and the Woman was gone , he went to the Place where he fell , and treading upon his Cane , he found that and the Watch . He cursed and swore very much , and a more impudent Fellow I never saw in my Life . Defence . I was going Home that Night about 12 o'Clock , and in Newport Street , I had Occasion to ease myself , and the Gentleman came down with a Woman , and d - mn 'd her for a B - ch , he wanted to ease himself , and bending down , he fell backwards . She helped him up , and I saw her pulling at something all the Time . I was almost blind then , and I am quite blind now ; so when they were gone , I went over to the Place , and groping about , I trod upon the Cane , and stooping down , I found the Watch and the Cane link 'd together . Next Morning I went to this Pawnbroker 's to get some Money upon the Watch , and he stopp 'd it . Jury . He says he was almost blind , how could he see the Prosecutor on the other Side of the Way ? He says , he went over the Way , and feeling for the Cane , found the Watch . Prisoner . I was not quite blind then . Acquitted . 41.
