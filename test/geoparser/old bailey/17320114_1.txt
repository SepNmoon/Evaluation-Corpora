Thomas Middleton , of the Parish of St. Mary le Bow , was indicted for feloniously stealing 50 lb . of Lead , value 5 s. the Goods of Rene De Boyville , on the 3d of this Instant January . He was a second time indicted for feloniously stealing 150 lb . of Lead , value 15 s. the Goods of Nathaniel Garland , on the 8th of this Instant January . Mr. De Boyville . Last Monday Seven-night the Lead of my Son 's Coffin was taken from the Vault in Bow Church . He was Buried there in the Year 1721 . I bought the Coffin of Thomas Reynolds , the Undertaker . Mr. Reynolds . The Prosecutor bought the Coffin of me . I saw it sodder 'd up , and the Body of his Son was then within it . And afterwards I attended the Funeral , and saw the same Coffin put into Bow Church Vault in February 1721. Francis Warner . Last Monday Sev'n-night , between Four and Five in the Morning , the Prisoner came to me with this Mallet and Chissel , and we went together into Bow Church Vault , and there he cut the Lead and Plate off of Mr. Boyville 's Son 's Coffin . I knew it to be his Coffin , because there was an Inscription upon it . I help 'd him to carry the Lead to Mr. Moore in King-street , in Old-Street-Square , who gave us at the Rate of 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it . The Prisoner was under Grave-Digger of Aldgate , and I am sometimes 'employ 'd as a Bearer , by Mr. Robinson , the Sexton , of Bow Church . The Prisoner got the Key of the Vault of Mr. Robinson 's Maid Mary , who will let him have it at any time , because he gives her now and then a Penny , or two Pence . Robert Moore . I bought the Lead of the Prisoner about Eight o'Clock last Monday Morning was Seven-night . There was a Hundred and three Quarters all cut to Pieces . I ask 'd him how he came by it ? he said , that he was employ 'd in clearing the Vaults at Aldgate Church , and the Church Wardens gave him leave to take it as a Perquisite , and make the best o n't . Prisoner . You said , bring what ye will , and I 'll buy it of ye . I have often sold you Coffin Handles ; but as for the Lead , was it I or Warner that brought it to you ? Moore . Warner was with you , but it was you that deliver 'd the Lead to me , and took the Money . John Newton . On the same Day Mr. Williamson brought three Hundred and a half of Lead to me , and I bought it of him at 13 s. a Hundred . One of my Men said , this Lead smells so strong of dead Corps that it almost choaks me . Phoo ! says I , that 's only your fancy ! But in two or three Days having occasion to melt some of it , I found this Piece among it , with this Inscription : Mr. Rene De Boyville Obijt Jan. 29th 1721. in the 16th Year of his Age . Upon which I went to Mr. Boyville and inform 'd him of it . Seth Williamson . I keep an Old-Iron Shop in Chissel-street . Mr. Moore came to me for some Iron to make Coffin Handles , and said he had some Lead to sell . I bought upwards of 300 Weight of him at 11 s. a Hundred , which I sold to Mr. Newton at 13 s. a Hundred . I asked Moore , who he bought it of ? He said of some Grave-Diggers who had it for Perquisites . Prisoner . Warner told me that he had Orders from Mr . Prior , the Church-Warden of Bow Church , to clear the Vault . And when I went down with him , he said , This is a good Place , my other Perquisites are but small , and when these Things [ Iron , Lead and Nails ] are gone , my Business will be worth nothing . Warner . A little while ago the Sexton gave me leave to go down and level the Floor of the Vault . The Prisoner went with me , and taking one of the Candles he look 'd all round the Vault . Lord ! says he , What a Sight of Brass Nails and Handles here is ? What a pity it is they should lie and spoil here , when I can have 2 d. a Pound for the worst Handle among them ? Prisoner . There 's Mr. Hall , the Common-Council Man , knows me , and can give me a Character . Mr. Hall . I know he has been Under-Grave-Digger in Aldgate Parish for four or five Years . We have had some suspicion of him , - and Yesterday we searched the South-Vault of the Church , and found it all robb 'd , - and Nobody had the Key but him and his Master , and his Master hears a very honest Character . John Maxey . I have known Warner come to the Prisoner before Five in the Morning , and say , Come Tom , I have got the Key , the Church-Warden has given me leave to rummage the Vault . Warner . I never said any such thing , nor ever had such Orders given me by the Church-Warden . Second Indictment . Nathaniel Garland . About the 30th of March 1726 , my Brother was Buried in Bow Church Vault . I was Administrator , and order 'd Mr. Stephen Roome , Undertaker in Fleet-street , to make a Wooden and a Leaden Coffin , but I did not see the Corps put in . John Paine . I saw the Deceased put into the Coffin , and afterwards Interr 'd in the Vault ; and hearing last Saturday that the Vault had been robb 'd , I enquir 'd after Mr. Garland 's Coffin . Warner told me , the Coffin was taken quite away , and the Corps thrown on the Ground , and shew 'd me the place where it lay . I knew the Body by two Things ; the Deceas 'd had been Lame , and one of his Legs was shorter than the other ; and after his Death his Body was open 'd for the Satisfaction of his Friends to know what Distemper he dy 'd of . Warner . Last Saturday Morning between 4 and 5 the Prisoner went into the Vault with this Mallet and Chissel . He broke the Wooden Coffin , and then cut the Sides of the Leaden one , and tumbled the Corps out upon the Ground , and cover 'd it with the Saw-Dust that came out of the Coffin . Says I , this Corps will soon be discover 'd by the smell if ye leave it here , and then I shall come into a scrape , and my Master may lose his place : No , says he , it has been Buried so long that there 's no fear of smelling . Then he cut the Lead to Pieces , and we carried it to Mr. Moore . There was about one Hundred and a half of it . When Mr. Paine came to me , I ript up the Shrond , and shew 'd him the Body . The Shroud look 'd as fresh and as white as the Shirt on your Lordship 's Back . Prisoner . Did not you take the Mallet out of our Vestry ? - 'T is the very Thing that Alderman Parsons knocks with . And did not you borrow the Chissel of your Brother-in-Law ? Warner . No , you brought them both to me . Prisoner . And will you swear too that you did not carry the Lead to Moore ? Warner . I helped to carry it . And when we came to Moore he seemed unwilling to buy it at first for fear of Trouble . What a Plague in Hell are ye afraid of ? says the Prisoner , Do n't ye know that I rummage the Church at Aldgate , and that these are my Perquisites ? - Well , but ( says Moore ) you promis 'd to bring me some Coffin Handles . And so I will to Morrow , says the Prisoner , as I hope to be saved , - upon my Life and Soul , - the Devil fetch me if I do n't . - And so Moore paid us for the Lead , but stopp 'd a Shilling till the Prisoner brought the Handles . Moore . I would have stopp 'd the Lead , but they said it was their Perquisites , and they came honestly by it , and so I gave them 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it , which is the Price that all Old-Iron Shops give . Prisoner . Warner brought me into the Secret , and said this and that , and t'other , and that I was safe enough , and he could get the Key of Mary , the Sexton 's Maid , and would I go one time and another time ? But I refus 'd to go several times , till at last he persuaded me there was no Danger in it . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of both Indictments . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 2. Susan Bonning , of St. Botolph without Bishopsgate , was indicted for stealing a Callicoe Gown , value 12 s. 2 Petticoats , value 10 s. 1 Cambrick Handkerchief , value 1 s. 6 d. and a half Guinea , and 10 s. 6 d. in Silver , the Goods and Money of Benjamin Hill ; and a Gold Ring , value 8s . the Goods of John Swift , in the House of Robert Phips , the 14th of December last . Mary Hill . I lost the Things in the Indictment ; and about a Fortnight after this , the Prisoner was carried to the Watch-House at Bishopsgate , and sent for my Son and me , and she confess 'd to us and the Constable that she had stolen the Goods and Money , only as I charged her with 22 s. She said there was but 21 s. Hosier Swift . I saw my Mother 's Things in the Trunk on the Sunday before she lost 'em . In the Evening of the same Day as my Mother was robb 'd , the Prisoner came to me and borrow 'd a Ridinghood and a Holland Apron of two Breadths , and said , She was going to a Play , but would make me drink first , and so she took me to the Black Raven Tavern in Bishopsgate-street , and there she shew 'd me two half Guineas and 16 s. and told me that she never went without Gold and Silver in her Pocket . Mary Hill . The Prisoner told me that Morning that she had not 2 d. in the World . Prisoner . I have had great Misfortunes for 10 Years past . I own I borrow 'd the Riding-hood of Mrs . Swift , tho ' I never carried it Home again ; but as for stealing Mrs. Hill 's Goods and Money I know Little of it . The Jury acquitted her . 3 , 4. William Moss and Humphrey Beach , of Queenhith , were indicted for stealing 2 Dozen of Muslin Handkerchiefs , value 30 s. 5 Dozen of Cotton Handkerchiefs , value 54 s. 50 Yards of Holland , value 6 l. 8 Damask Table Cloths , val . 6 l. 5 Diaper Table Cloths , value 25 s. 9 Caps , value 5 s. 12 Yards of Tabling Diaper , value 30 s. and several Pair of Stockings , the Goods of Daniel White , the 9th of November last . Daniel White . I sent five Parcels of Goods to the Windsor Row-Barge , and directed them for my self to be left at the Warehouse at Windsor till call 'd for . When I went to ask for these Parcels at Windsor , I found but three of them , the other two being lost . Most of the Goods in those two Parcels were stopt by Justice Lade , who advertis 'd them . I went to his Worship , and found all my Goods except a Box of Headcloths , 2 Dozen of Handkerchiefs , two Diaper Table Cloths , and some Stockings . Robert Taylor . I took the five Parcels of the Prosecutor about Four in the Afternoon , in the beginning of November , and saw them safe stow 'd in the Windsor Row-Barge , and two of the five Parcels were afterwards lost out of the Barge . James Crawford , Waterman . On the 10th of November , as I was standing at Cupid 's Bridge , where I ply , the Prisoner Beach past me , and went into the King 's Head Alehouse . A Peter Boat had been robb 'd a little before , and Beach was suspected to have been concern 'd in it , he having dispos 'd of some Fish and other Things which were thought to have been taken out of that Boat , and so I and some other Watermen agreed to take him . We went and found him and Moss ( the other Prisoner ) sitting by the Fire , and two Parcels of Goods lying by them . We seized Beach , but Moss got by us and hid himself in the Cellar , where we afterwards found him . They gave no account how they came by the Goods , and so were carried before Justice Lade . The Goods were open 'd there , and I saw Stockings , Diaper , and other Shop Goods . Several other Witnesses confirm 'd the above James Crawford 's Evidence . Prisoner , Moss . As I was standing by the Pump at Margaret's-Hill , a Man and a Woman came by with two Bundles . She asked me to lend her a Hand , and she would satisfy me for my Pains . I took one of the Bundles , and went with her to this Alehouse at Cupid 's Bridge , where we sat down to drink , and when the Watermen came in , she and that Man ran away , which made me fear I was got into a scrape , and so I hid myself . The Jury acquitted Beach , and found Moss guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5. Robert Peck , of St. Mary Colechurch , was indicted for privately stealing eight Volumes of the Abridgement of the Statutes , value 30 s. Langley 's Young Builder 's Rudiments , value 5 s. and Kersey 's Dictionary , value 2 s. the Goods of John Noon , in his Shop , the 27th of December last . John Noon . The Books lay on my Counter , and between 5 and 6 in the Evening as my Spouse was in the back Part of the Shop , she saw a Man go out , upon which she called me , and I miss 'd the Books . Next Morning I sent my Servant among the Booksellers to desire them to stop such Books if offer 'd to Sale . About Noon , the same Day , Mr. King came to my Shop , saying such Books were stopt . I went to his Mother 's Shop in Fore-street , and there I found one Dowles , who said he had the Books of three Men , who were at the Swan and Hoop Alehouse . Mr. King , and I and Dowles went thither , and found them . A scuffle ensued . They endeavour 'd to break from us . The Prisoner stabb 'd me in the Shoulder with a Penknife . I call 'd for Assistance , and up came A Gentleman Soldier , and wrestled with him . The two others got off , Dowles follow 'd them . Jacob Dowle . I formerly kept a Book-Stall in Moorfields , but was forc 'd to leave off thro ' Misfortunes . The Prisoner and two more sent for me to an Alehouse , the Prisoner gave me the Books , and bid me make the most of them , for they were in haste . I went to the Widow King 's , at the Bible and Crown in Forestreet , where I was stopp 'd . Richard King . I went to the Alehouse with Mr . Noon and Dowle , and there we found the Prisoner and the other Men . I ask 'd Dowle which of them deliver 'd the Books to him , and he said the Prisoner . Prisoner . I met an old Ship-mate and another , and we went to drink at the Black Bull in Petticoat-Lane ; Dowle came to us , and my Ship-mate said he had some Books to sell , but they were at his Lodgings over the way . Dowle went with him thither , and fetch 'd the Books , and then we went together to the Swan and Hoop by Moorfields , where he left us , and went to sell the Books ; he staid above half an Hour , and then came with Mr . Noon and Mr. King . My Ship mate and the other ran out , and Dowle after them , and then a Soldier knock 'd me down . I ow 'd Money , and was afraid of an Arrest , which made me struggle to get off . Dowle has been in Goal several times . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 6.

My Apprentice ask 'd the Prisoner 's Girl Saily , what good Things her Mother used to carry to Mr. Coats 's ? and the Child said , whole Cheeses . When the Prisoner came in , he told her that Coats would have he bring something good as she used to do . Oh ! she says , I know what he means , - 't is Dog's-meat . As soon as I was inform 'd of this , I sent my Man to Coats 's , under pretence of buying some Cheese , to see if he could find any with my mark , and he brought back Coats himself , and this Cheese , which I knew to be mine by my mark DXP ; Coats confess 'd he bought this and three more of the Prisoner . Benjamin Holding . By my Master 's Orders I went to Coats 's House , and there found this Cheese , which I knew to be my Master 's by the mark .

The Prisoner was Nurse to a poor Woman who was sick in Norton-Falgate Workhouse . The Church-Wardens hearing the poor Woman was dead , went and turn 'd the Prisoner out of the Room , and lock 'd the Door . At Night the Prisoner and a Man broke the Door open , and took away the Goods . The Prisoner in her Defence said , that the Deceas 'd on her Death-Bed bequeathed her those Goods for the Care she had taken in attending on her , and that the Church-Wardens shut her out to hinder her from taking them ; the Jury acquitted her . 10. Robert Hallam , of St. Ann 's , in Middlesex , was indicted , for that he by a Devilish Instigation , and of his Malice afore-thought , on the 9th of December last , on Jane his Wife , then being great with Child , and in a Room one Pair of Stairs high , did make an Assault with both his Hands , and out of a Window in the said Room did throw the said Jane upon a Stone-Pavement , whereby she was mortally bruised on her Back , Loins , and other Parts , of which she instantly Died , and so he wilfully and of Malice afore-thought did Kill and Murder the said Jane . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . At the Prisoner 's Desire the Witnesses against him were examined apart . Charles Bird , the Prisoner 's Apprentice . On Wednesday the 9th of December , about 11 at Night , I went to Bed , and fell asleep , but was awaked by a Noise between 12 and 1 . I heard my Mistress ( in the Room under me ) cry Murder ! For God 's Sake do n't murder me ! For the Lord 's Sake , Robin , do n't murder me ! Pity me ! for Christ 's Sake ! - for my poor Family 's Sake ! - Then she call 'd me , Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! and once she cry 'd louder than ordinary . The Prisoner said , G - d d - n you , what do you want with Charles ? I was afraid he would come up to me , and so I stepp 'd out of Bed , and was going to get out of the Window , to save my self , but a Child that lay with me ( who was lame , and could not speak plain , tho ' it was ten Years old ) cry 'd Sharly ! Sharly ! do no go . Then I consider 'd with my self , that by venturing out at Window I might be accessary to my own Death , and so I went to Bed again . I heard a great many very violent Blows , which by the Sound seem 'd to be given with the Tongs , or the Fire-shovel . By and by the Neighbours cry 'd Murder ! and I heard the Street-Door open , which I thought the People without had broke open . Then I said within my self , By the leave of the Lord I will venture out , as soon as the Mob comes in ; but presently I heard the Prisoner come up Stairs into his own Chamber . Prisoner . How do you know it was I that came up , when you did not see me ? Bird . Because as soon as you came up I heard you scolding again - I got up , and was going down Stairs , about 6 in the Morning , I heard a low Voice ( which I thought was my Mistres 's ) and it said , Charles , go and strike a Light , and take the Tin Pot and draw some Beer . I did so , and brought it up . And the Voice said again , Set it down upon the Chest and leave it there . I did so ; but I neither saw his nor her Face , for they were both cover 'd in the Bed . - Then the Voice bid me make a Fire , which I did ; and while I was blowing it up I heard 2 or 3 dismal Groans . Then I went to my Work . Court . What Work . Bird . The Prisoner is a Waterman , and I am his 'Prentice - I went to the Plying-Place , which is a Stone 's Throw from our Alley . This was between 6 and 7 o'Clock ; and about 8 Job Allen came to me , and told me my Mistress was dead . Then I have lost a very good Mistress , said I ; and with that I ran home to know the Truth of it ; and there I saw Dr. Smith , and the Constable , and the Prisoner , and I found it was too true ! my poor Mistress was dead indeed ! - Then I went to my Work again . Prisoner . How do you know but it was your Mistress that came up Stairs ? for you said you thought it was me , only because you heard my Voice after I was come up . Bird . I thought it was not possible that my Mistress shou 'd come up Stairs so readily , after the Blows that she received , and the Groans and Cries that she made . Prisoner . Did you hear us both go down ? Bird . I do n't remember that I heard any more than one . Prisoner . Did not you come home to Dinner the Day before this happened , and your Mistress told you she 'd give you no Victuals , for she intended to make away with her self ? Bird . No . I came home to Dinner , and there was cold Beef ; I desir 'd her to let me broil it , and she said , with all her Heart ; I might do as I wou 'd - She was as good a Woman as ever broke Bread . Ann Anderson . I live next Door to the Prisoner , there is but a thin Deal-Partition betwixt his Room and ours , so that one may hear in one Room what passes in the other , very plainly - Between 11 and 12 on Wednesday Night , while I was in Bed , I heard the Prisoner say to his Wife , G - d d - n you ! tell me the Truth . - Several Blows were given - I awaked my Husband , and said , D 'ye hear ? Hallam 's a beating his Wife , according to Custom . Then she got from him , ran down Stairs , and out at the Street-Door ; he follow 'd ; I open 'd my Window , and saw him beat her in the Street , and force her in again . He shut the Door , and while she was in the Entry I heard her cry very loud , Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! When they came into the Chamber , I heard a great many unmerciful Blows , which by the jarring Sound I thought to be given with the Fire-shovel or Tongs ; and , as if her Breath was almost gone , she cry 'd , Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! - I thought the Blows were more like beating an Ox than a Christian ! a Woman big with Child ! Soon after , she cry 'd , O Robin ! spare my Life ! do n't kill me ! for God 's Sake ! for Christ 's Sake ! for my poor Infant 's Sake ! - Then I heard a struggling and a rustling towards the Window - she gave a lamentable great Shrick , and presently I heard something rush from the Window with such Violence that I thought the Window-Frame had follow 'd . This was between 12 and 1 . I jump 'd out of Bed , ran to the Window , and look 'd out . He ran down Stairs , and came out of the Door in his Shirt , with a Candle in his Hand ; his Wife was lying in the Street . He damn 'd her for a Bitch , and said she was drunk . He set down the Candle on a Bench , and taking her by the Arms , dragg 'd her backward up the Steps into the Entry , and shut the Door ; as he was hauling her in , I called out , You Villain ! you wicked Rogue ! you have thrown your Wife out of the Window , and kill 'd her ! All the Neighbours were alarm 'd , and several came out , and said , For Christ 's Sake do n't use the poor Woman so , but let some Body help her ; but he would let no Body . After he had got her in , I heard several Groans , and thought she might be in Labour , for she was so near her Time , that she look 'd every Hour , but about 6 she dy 'd , and half an Hour after he went out and brought a Mid wife . O ye Villian , said I , you have call 'd a Midwife , now your Wife is dead ! About 9 I went in when the Doctor was there , and he said she had been dead a long Time . Her Right-Hand was cut all a-cross the Fingers , and the Window-Post was bloody with strugling . The Prisoner said , see how the wicked Jade has cut her Hand with the Glass-Window in getting out . But I look 'd , and there was not one Pane of Glass broke , nor was any of the Glass bloody , but only the Post . Prisoner . Where was I when you talk 'd about cutting her Hand with the Glass ? Ann Anderson . In your Room . Prisoner . Have not you ow 'd me a Spight these 2 Years . Ann Anderson . His Wife shew 'd me her Arms twice , a good while ago , and they were as black as your Lordship 's Gown , and therefore he has bore me Malice ever since . Swan Anderson , the Husband of the last Witness . On Wednesday the 9th of December , the Prisoner came Home between 11 and 12 at Night , and begun to scold at , and beat and abuse his Wife ; she thought to escape by running down Stairs , but he was too nimble for her , and catch 'd her just without the Street-Door , and beat her so barbarously , that he rais 'd all the Neighbours , who cry 'd out , shame on him . He beat her thro ' the Entry up Stairs , and in the Chamber she cry 'd , Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! and afterwards , O Robin ! - What are you going to do ? - For God 's Sake spare my Life ! - Do n't kill me ! - for Christ 's Sake ! - for my poor Family 's Sake . Then I heard a strugling , a rustling like the rustling of a Tarpaulin , the Woman gave a great shriek , and something rush 'd out of the Window at once - I could hear very plain , for there 's only a Deal Partition betwixt my Room and the Prisoner 's - I and my Wife jump 'd out of Bed , and went to our Window . The Prisoner came out of his Door with a Candle in his Hand . His Wife was then lying on the Stone Pavement , she lay like a Log , and neither stirr 'd Hand nor Foot . He set down the Candle , took her by the Shoulders , and haul 'd her upon her Back up 3 Steps . - My Wife and other Neighbours call 'd to him , and cry 'd , Murder ! He took no Notice of them , but dragg 'd her in , and shut the Door fast . - Then he dragg 'd her up Stairs . - It must be he that did it , for No-body was there to do it but himself , - and I heard several heavy Groans ; but whether they were hers or his , I do n't know . Prisoner . Did she walk up Stairs herself , or did I drag her ? Swan Anderson . Walk ! No , it was impossible she should . Prisoner . Did you not afterwards hear her speak in the Chamber ? Swan Anderson . No , I heard you mutter something to your self , but I believe she was not able to speak . Prisoner . Did you not hear her Voice ? Swan Anderson . No . John Fleming . I have lived next Door to the Prisoner 3 Years , - there 's only a thin Partition between us , so that I can hear every Word that 's spoke in his Room . For this 12 Month past , I have frequently heard great Out-cries of Murder . And particularly about 3 Weeks before her Death , he came home in a jealous Fit , and beat her , and swore he 'd Murder her , if he was hang 'd for it . I heard her cry , O for God 's sake Mercy ! Pity me ! - Pity the tender Infant within me ! Damn ye , for a Bitch , says he , I 'll send you , and your Infant to the Devil together ! - I 'll split your Skull , and dash your Brains against the Back of the Chimney - I know I shall come to be hang 'd at Tyburn for ye . And that Night as she was kill 'd , I heard him beating her again , and a great many Blows he gave her . She begg 'd , For God 's Sake ! - For Christ Jesus 's Sake ! and for her poor Children 's Sake ! that he would not kill her ! and she call 'd , Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! and gave a great Shrick ! Then I heard Mrs. Anderson get out of her Bed , throw open her own Window , and cry out , He has thrown his Wife out of Window ! I struck a light , and saw it was then about half an Hour after 12 . Mr. Anderson and his Wife lodge in the fore Part of the House , and I in the back Part . After the Prisoner was taken by Mr. Betty , the High-Constable , I heard him say , I will not wrong my Conscience , I believe the Blows I gave her , and my threatening to fetch my Cane , was the Cause of her going out of the Window , but I was not in the Chamber at that time . He was before the Justice 8 or 10 Months ago for abusing her , and throwing her upon the Bed , while he had a Knife in his Mouth , and swearing he would rip her up . Prisoner . Did not you hear me in another Room when the Out-cry was of her being thrown out of the Window ? Fleming . No . Prisoner . Did you hear the Blows ? Fleming . Yes . Prisoner . And did not they found as if they were struck against a Door to get it open ? Fleming . No , they founded as if struck against a Human Body . Prisoner . Did you see my Wife after her Death ? Had she any marks ? Fleming . Yes . All her left Side was black - and the Body of the Child within was black , and part of its Head was greenish , - but I did not take very particular Notice . Ann Anderson , again . The Constable order 'd me to search the Body . I found a great many Marks and Spots of black and blue that must be made by dreadful Blows . James Furnell . I and Richard Horseford were accidentally coming through the Street that Night , and I believe near 100 Yards before we came to the Prisoner 's House I heard the blows , and an outcry of O ! O ! with some other Words , but I could not tell exactly what those Words were . As we came nearer , the Cries encreas 'd , and says I to Mr. Horseford , This Fellow will kill his Wife . No , says he , 't is only a Family Quarrel , and they 'll be good Friends again by and by . We pass 'd the Door , for we were going to a House a little beyond , but looking about we thought we were gone too far , and so turning back , I heard the Woman say twice or thrice , For God 's Sake , Robin , save my Life ! - Do n't throw me out o'Window ! - I did not imagine that the Fellow would be such a Villain to do it , for if we had thought he would , I believe we could have catch 'd her and broke her fall ; but suddenly the Casement burst open , and she came out with her Back foremost , and fell down on the Stones . There was a Candle in the Chamber , and I saw a Man there , near the Window , which I believe was the Prisoner , but I am not sure of it . I was within 8 or 10 Yards of her when she fell , she groaned , but was not able to rise . Presently the Prisoner came down with the Candle in his Hand , went to his Wife , and took her by one Arm to lift her up , but finding her helpless , he said , G - d d - n ye , ye Drunken Bitch , get up ! She had nothing on but a Shirt , a Flannel Petticoat , a thin loose Gown , and one Shoe ; but neither Stockings nor Cap . Then the Prisoner set down the Candle , took her by both Arms , dragg 'd her in , and lock 'd the Door . We went and acquainted the Watch with it , but they took no farther Notice than to Laugh at it , and next Morning I heard she was dead . Prisoner . Did you see me push her out ? Furnell . No ; I saw you , or some Man like you , near the Window ; and before she came out , I heard a rustling , as if it was in Opposition , and as she came out she gave a terrible shrick . Prisoner . If you saw her fall , why did not you help her up ? Furnell . I heard you coming down , - when you came out you was in your Shirt and Night-cap . Prisoner . You could hear things very plain ! Furnell . It was a very still Night , I was a Stranger to both you and your Wife . Richard Horseford . On the 9th of December , between 12 and 1 in the Morning , I was coming along Ropemaker's-Fields with Mr. Furnell , and just as we turned out of Church-Lane , I heard several Blows , and coming nearer , a Woman 's Voice cry 'd , For God 's Sake , Robin , spare my Life ! - Murder ! - For God 's Sake spare my Life this time . This Fellow will kill his Wife , says Mr. Furnell ; no , says I , 't is only a Family-Quarrel , and we shall get no Thanks for meddling betwixt a Man and his Wife ; and so we pass 'd the Door , and went forward , but thinking we were got beyond the place we intended to go to , we turned back , and heard the Woman cry , For God 's Sake , Robin , do n't throw me out at Window ! - For the Lord 's Sake ! - For Christ 's sake ! - spare my Life ! - I look 'd up towards the Window , and suddenly the Casement flew open , and at once the Woman came out with her Back foremost . I saw the glympse of a Man in the Room , - I was 10 or 12 Yards off when she fell , - She lay at length on her Back like one dead , - Just as we came to her , a Man came out in his Shirt with a Candle in his left Hand , and he put his right Hand under her Arm to lift her up , and said , G - d d - n ye , ye Drunken Bitch , get up ; but finding he could not manage her with one Hand , he set down the Candle , and dragg 'd her in with both Hands , and shut the Door . We went to the Watch-house at Dick 's Shore , but none of the Watchmen were there ; and at last we found them at an Alehouse . Prisoner . Did she cry when I took her up ? Horseford . No ; but she groaned twice . Elizabeth Emerson . On Wednesday the 8th of December , about 3 in the Afternoon , I saw the Deceas 'd , and asked her how she did ? O , says she , I shall be murder 'd to Night ! Why so ? says I . Why , says she , the Child has told me that my Husband is gone to eat a Leg o'Mutton and Turnips at Will Perkins 's , and there he 'll get Drunk , and then come Home and Murder me . He had kept Account of my Reckoning from the 11th of March , but now he has moved it to the 11th of April , and wants me to lay my Child to a Man in the Country ; and he said if I would not , he wish 'd the Devil might appear to us both in a great Flame of Fire , and carry him away before my Face if he did not Murder me when he came Home at Night . And so she desir 'd me to leave my Cellar Door open that she might ran in and hide herself when he came ; I told her she should not go in the Cellar , but I would leave my other Doors open , and she should come into my Room and Welcome . And so I did , and I do n't know whether or no she was coming to me , but he met her , and she turn 'd back , and about Midnight , when he came Home I heard him swear , he 'd make her remember leaving the House . He beat her up Stairs , she cry 'd out , O , says my Child , that wicked Man is beating his Wife . I heard something fall into the Street , and then his Door was open 'd . I ran out , and he was dragging her in . O Mr. Hallam , says I , ( clapping my Hands ) take pity of her , for she 's a dead Woman . He made me no Answer . I lean 'd over the Bench at his Door to save her , but he pull 'd her Legs into the Entry , and then threw her down , and said , Dead or Alive , lie there ! and so he shut the Door against me , and bolted it . Many a time have I seen him beat her , and two or three Nights in a Week I have heard her cry out Murder , and have often gone to help her , and got behind him , and held my Arms round his Neck thus - while she has run away for fear of being murder 'd . Sarah Lane , Midwife . On Thursday Morning before Eight , the Prisoner call 'd me to come to his Wife ; I was not quite dress 'd , he desir 'd me to make haste ; he went away , and return 'd in 5 or 6 Minutes to hasten me . She had spoke to me the Friday before to be her Midwife , and I knowing her time was out , thought she was in Labour . But as I came along with him , he told me his Wife had met with a sad Misfortune ; I ask 'd him how ? O Mrs. Lane , says he , she got out of a Window while I was in another Room . When I came there , a Neighbour said she was Dead , and so I found her , for her Face , Hands and Feet were quite cold , but her Body was a little warm . - Another Neighbour came in and asked him how she got up Stairs , and he said she walked up . At Night we stripp 'd her , and I search 'd her Body . There was a great Bruise on her left Arm , and several lesser Bruises on her Back and Sides like Slashes . Her right Hand was cut . The Child was full grown , and black from Head to Foot , especially on the left Side . Prisoner . Did not you bid me send for a Smelling-Bottle , because she was in a Fit ? Lane . Yes ; and I bid you go for a Doctor ; for tho ' I thought she was dead , I was not willing to trust to my own Judgment , because I have no great Skill in the Dead ; but I told you that she did not stir , and in my Opinion never would any more . Sarah Adams . About a quarter past 12 , on Wednesday Night , I happened to be up , and a Neighbour called to me , and said , Hark ! there 's a crying out , our little Neighbour is in Labour ; but presently there was a great Shrick , and Cry of Murder ! So I went and sat at Mrs. Mingo 's Door , which is almost over against the Prisoner 's . The Deceased cry 'd , For Christ 's Sake , do n't murder me ! for God 's Sake ! for my poor Family 's sake , spare me ! - Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! - G - d d - n you for a Bitch , says the Prisoner , what do ye call Charles for ? This was follow 'd by 3 or 4 heavy Blows . The Window was forced open , and she came out , and seemed to catch at the Sign-Post in falling , but miss 'd it , and came to the Ground . She gave dismal Groans . The Prisoner came out in his Shirt , it was speckled Shirt , and with a Candle in his Hand ; and going to lift her up with one Hand , he said , G - d d - n the Bitch , she 's drunk , and has thrown her self out at Window . Then he dragg 'd her in , shut his Door , went up and shut the Casement , and put out his Candle . Prisoner . Was you or Mr. Furnell nearest my Wife when she fell ? Adams . Mr. Furnell and his Friend were coming by before she fell out . I begg 'd 'em for God 's Sake to stop , for here was a Man that would murder his Wife . And one of 'em said , What have we to do between a Man and his Wife ? But for God 's Sake stay , says I , for fear he should kill his 'Prentice too , who is my Sister 's Son . Elizabeth Mingo . I says to my Mother , Lord Mother ! there 's Mr. Hallam a beating his Wife ! I saw her make her first Escape , and saw him come out and haul her in again , but I did not hear what he said then ; but I heard Blows , and heard her shriek , and then heard her lump out of the Window . Joseph Woodward , Surgeon . The Overseers of the Poor desired me to view the Body of the Deceased . Her Arm was bruised , there were 3 or 4 Marks on it , like the Marks made by a Stick , and there was a Wound in the Palm of her Right Hand , above an Inch long , and a quarter of an Inch deep ; it seem 'd to be a Stab with a Knife . I did not take notice of the small Bruises . On Saturday , the Coroner order 'd me to open the Body . - The Abdomen was full of contused Blood , the Womb was rent 7 Inches , and the Infant , which was dead , but full grown , was forced out of the Womb , all but its Feet . The first thing we saw when the Tegament of the Belly was opened , was the Child 's Right Hand ; and I believe the Fall was the Cause of her and the Child 's immediate Death . Mary Thomson . Coming out of my House I heard dismal Groans , and I called out to Mrs. Adams , that there had been a Woman in Labour ; but Elizabeth Mingo cry 'd Murder ! Then I heard the Deceased cry , For God 's Sake , spare my Life ! Do n't murder me to Night , for my poor Childrens Sake ! The Prisoner ran to the Chimney , and took the Tongs or Shovel , as I guess 'd by the Sound , and gave her several Blows . She shriek 'd , and presently she came backwards two-double out of the Window . I heard her groan , and saw the Prisoner come out with a Candle , and drag her in and shut the Door . Ann Brewit , the Deceased 's Mother . The Prisoner brought a Woman to my House to Lye in ; she was a bold Sort of a Woman ; and he said to my Husband , Father , will you let her stay here ? No ; says my Husband . Why then , says the Prisoner , your Daughter shall suffer for it . My Daughter complained to me , that about a Twelve month ago he put a Knife in his Mouth , and threw her upon the Bed , and went to cut her open . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . I do n't doubt but to give the Court full Satisfaction of my Innocency when I have called my Witnesses . Elizabeth Wilkinson . On Wednesday the 8th of December , between 9 and 10 in the Morning , I went to the Prisoner 's House for a Pot of Beer , ( he keeps an Ale-house , the Three Mariners in Rope-maker 's Fields , Limehouse ) and when I came into the Kitchen , his Wife was sitting before the Fire . I stood at a little Distance , I saw she took no notice of me , and so I said , Pray , Mrs. Hallam , what 's the Matter with ye ? She made me no Answer . I ask 'd her again , but still she said nothing ; and at last , says I , Lord ! Mrs. Hallam , what 's the Matter with ye ? Why , says she , I am thinking when the Devil will come for me . Lydia Stevens . About 4 a Clock on Thursday Morning , I was going to wash at a House at Dick 's Shore ( I am a Washer-woman ) and I called at the Prisoner 's House for a Pint of Beer ; he had got a Pot of Water in his Hand , and he said , Have you heard this unhappy Fate ? My Wife has thrown her self out of the Window . I wish you 'd carry up this Water , while I draw your Drink . I went up with the Water , and said , How do you do , Mrs. Hallam ? How happened this ? Why , says she , I ca n't tell very well ; I unfortunately drop 'd my self out of the Window , I feel a Pain in the Bottom of my Belly ; but if I should do otherwise than well , there 's Anderson and Fleming are so hard-mouth 'd , that if my Husband should come to a Tryal , they will swear his Life away ; and therefore I beg you would speak in his Behalf , for he is innocent of throwing me out of the Window . The Window has 3 Lights , the Casement is in the middle , it is about a Yard high from the Floor . Ruth Tate . I and my Aunt went up Ropemaker 's Fields . I heard Betty Wild , a Fish-Woman , cry out Murder ! and Mr. Pidgeon ( who keeps a Brandy-Shop over-against her ) said , What 's the Matter ? and she said , Mrs. Hallam has thrown her self out of the Window . Prisoner . Does not Betty Wild go by the Name of Mingo ? Tate . Yes ; but Wild was her Maiden Name . I saw the Prisoner take the Deceased up under his Arm ( after she fell out o ' Window ) and carry her in , but I did not hear him say any thing . Hannah Radbourne . I saw the Deceased between 10 and 11 , the Morning before she dy 'd . She was sitting on the Settle by the Fire-side , rubbing her Hands , in a very melancholly Mood . What 's the Matter , says I ? Why , says she , the Devil 's got into me , and I believe he will never leave me till I have made away with my self ; I desir 'd her not to have such Thoughts in her Head ; and she said it was no Business of mine , and I need not trouble my Head about it . Mary Carman . I live about a quarter of a Mile from the Deceased 's House ; she came to me on Saturday Fortnight before she dy 'd , and staid till Sunday Night . She shew 'd me her Arm , it was black ; I ask 'd her how it came ? She said her Husband hit her with a Pint-Pot , and she said , Carman ! if any thing should happen to me extraordinary , those People at the next Door will swear my Husband 's Life away . I suppose she did not then think that her End would be so soon . I went to see her about 8 a Clock that Morning she dy 'd , and she was then warm . Andrew Radbourn , ( the Prisoner 's Brother-in-law . ) About 4 a Clock on Thursday Morning , I came up from Limehouse-Hole , thro ' Ropemaker 's Walk ; I saw Lydia Stevens , the Washer-woman , at the Prisoner 's House , and he was coming up Stairs with a pint of Beer in his Hand . I asked how he came to be up so soon ? and he said , his Wife had hove herself out of the Window . I went up , and asked her how it happened ? and she said , she had been disturbed in her Mind the Day before ; and that she was possess 'd with the fear of the Devil , and so she had hove herself out of the Window . And , says she , Fleming and Anderson are so malicious , that they would swear away my Husband 's Life ; but he was not in the Room , nor nigh me , when I did it ; and therefore I desire you would put off your Voyage , and appear for him at his Tryal , which I accordingly did ; for I was going to Sea , but I lost my Voyage on purpose to serve him . I have eat and drank , and lain in the House many a-time , but I never knew any Dispute between them in my Life . Sabina Gibbs . I was going up Ropemakers-Walk , and heard Betty Wild ( her Name is now Mingo ) cry Murder . Mr. Pidgeon , who lives opposite to her , opened his Window , and said , what 's the Matter ! Why , says she , Mrs. Hallam has thrown herself out of the Window . And then I saw the Prisoner come down in his Shirt , and take her up . Thomas Dowty , the Constable . When the Prisoner was taken by the High Constable ( Mr. Betty ) he brought him to my House , and sent me to take an Inventory of his Goods . I ask 'd Charles Bird , the Prisoner 's 'Prentice , [ who was the first Witness ] where he was when his Master and Mistress had Words ? and he said , abed and asleep ; and about 6 o'Clock I heard my Mistress 's Voice , bidding me strike a Light , and draw some Beer , and set it on the Chest . Court . This is no Contradiction to Bird 's Deposition , for he swore that he was asleep when the Quarrel began , but that the Noise waked him . Prisoner . Pray , Mr. Gull , tell my Lord what you have heard Bird say . Nathaniel Gull . On the Saturday after the Prisoner was committed , I heard Charles Bird say , that the Prisoner was not in the Room , but on the Stairs , when his Mistress fell out of the Window . Charles Bird . I do n't know this Gull , I never saw him in my Life before . Gull . What ! Do n't you know me , Child ? Bird . No , not you , Child ! Prisoner . Mr. Benham , pray give the Court an Account of my Character . John Benbam . Your Character ! I know nothing of ye ! George Taylor . I was with Mr. Dowty when he took the Inventory .
