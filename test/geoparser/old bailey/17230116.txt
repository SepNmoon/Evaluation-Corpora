He was a second Time indicted for stealing a Plough Coulter and Tuck , value 2 s. the Goods of Tho Rigdon , at the same Time and Place . The facts were plainly proved upon the Prisoner and he having little to say in his Defence , the Jury found him guilty on both Indictments to the value of 10 d. Transportation . John Smith , and Robert Render , Carpenters , in the Parish of St. Andrews Holborn , were indicted for feloniously stealing two Deal Boards , value 2 s. the Goods of Robert Ragdel , the 17th of this instant January . The Prosecutor depos 'd that as he sat in an Ale-House he saw John Smith take the Boards out of his Work-Shop , and carry them about 600 yards , into another House . That Render was one he had put in Trust to look after his Goods , as his Foreman . John Smith pleaded , That he having Occasion for two Boards , went to Robert Render , and desir 'd him to let him have two Boards , and bid him charge them down to his Accompt ; he said also , there was an accompt depending of about 40 l. The Prisoner Smith call 'd Evidence to prove , there was no clandestine taking the Boards , but having a Job of Work in Hand near that Place , and his Deals falling short , he went and took the Deals on Accompt , rather than to go home for them , which was a great Way off . He appear 'd to be a Man of Reputation , and Robert Render a Person whom the Prosecutor employ 'd as his Foreman , and intrusted with the Disposing of his Goods . Upon the full Hearing of the Matter the Jury acquitted them , and order 'd Smith a Copy of his Indictment . William Barter , of the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for Assaulting Isaac Andrews , and taking from him a Hat , value 3 s. and a Perriwig , value 3 s. the 10th of this Instant January . The Prosecutor depos 'd That as he was going down Drury Lane he was set upon by three or four Persons , and had his Hat and Wig taken away . Other Evidence depos 'd That the Prisoner deliver 'd the Hat to Charles Gardiner , who bought the Hat . The Prisoner deny 'd the Fact and said , that one Nell Harrel told him , she had found a Hat . The Jury acquitted him . John Thompson , of the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for breaking the House of George Bradshaw , in the Night Time , and taking from thence 10 s. and 6 d. the 3d of this Instant January . The Prosecutor depos 'd . That the sash was lifted up and a Boy put in , and the Money taken out of the Drawer . That there were two little Boys that gave him an Account , That this Evidence and one Gust went in at the Window and gave the Money to the Prisoner , and they went and shared it among them . George Purchase and Roger White , two Boys , depos 'd , that the Prisoner , James Gust and two others , went to the Prosecutors , and the Prisoner went in to drink , and when the People were gone down to fetch Drink , he came out and gave them Notice . That then James Gust and the others lifted up the sash and went in , and took out the Half Guinea and gave it to the Prisoner , and they went and shared the Money , and gave them a Penny a piece for themselves . That they were planted there to give Notice by Whistling , if they saw any Body coming that was likely to disturb them . The Prisoner deny 'd the Fact , and call 'd one , who depos 'd , That one of the Boys , upon the Prisoner 's having threaten 'd to take him up , and carry him a Bridewell , for making a Disturbance about his House , he had before threaten 'd to tip him Justice , which he Suppos 'd to be done this Way , by swearing falsely against him . He call 'd many of his Neighbours , who gave him a good Character . The Jury acquitted him . William Harris , of the Parish of St. James Westminster , was indicted for the Murther of Jeremiah Matthews , by giving him a mortal Wound on the Side of his Head with a Staff , the 12th Day of last December , of which he languished till the 17th of December and then died . He was also indicted a second Time upon the Coroner 's Inquest for the same . Several Evidences , who had been in Company with the deceased , deposed , That themselves and the deceased had been drinking at the House of one Mr. Brown , in Little Windmill-Street . That they all being pretty much in Liquor , would have had more , which the Landlord refus 'd them ; that at last being Merry they went to trying their Strength by Wrestling , and two or three of them were thrown down under the Fire Grate ; that Mr. Brown call 'd the Prisoner , who was a Watchman , and charg 'd him with them , who carried them to the Round House ; that by the Way the deceased was knock 'd down . One of them depos 'd , That the deceased was two or three Times push 'd on the Breast by the Prisoner with his Staff , and afterwards knock 'd down , and attempted two or three Times to rise , but could not ; and that he set him with his Back against a Wall , but did not see any Provocation given by the deceased . Two Surgeons depos 'd That the deceased was cut , or wounded , on the Side of the Head , above the Ear , the Length of Six or seven Inches , so that the Skull lay bare , and the Skin and Flesh hung over his Ear ; and that , tho ' there was no Depresssion of the Skull visible outwardly , yet opening the Head after his decease , they found two Fractures of the Skull , one upon the Temple Bone , and another upon the Bregma , several Inches long , with extravasated Blood , and a Pressure upon the Meninges of the Brain ; and , that the Wounds were the cause of his Death . Other Evidences depos 'd , That the deceased did charge his Death upon the Prisoner , saying He was murthered by him . The Evidences for the Prisoner depos 'd much the same as those for the King had done , as to their being drinking at Mr. Brown 's House , and the Occasion of their being sent to the Round House , but with this Difference , That they refus 'd to pay the Reckoning , and began to quarrel among themselves , and were very troublesome , and that their Wrestling and Throwing one another down , seem 'd rather in earnest than jest ; and that the deceased was thrown under the Grate , and two more upon him ( tho ' one of the Evidences for the King said he was the Person that was undermost , and did not know that the deceased was thrown down there at all ) The Landlord added , That in their Quarrelling they had broken a Table , a Mug , and the Windows , and refusing to pay their Reckoning , thereupon he call 'd the Watchman . Mary Beesely ; the Servant Maid , depos 'd That when they were carried out of the House she went a little way after them , and perceiving a Scuffle among them , ran back to her Master 's Door , calling out to him , saying , They would beat the Watch ; and then ran to them , and saw the deceased have hold of the Watchman 's staff , endeavouring to wrest it out of his Hand ; and that one of the Watchmen 's Hit and Wig was on the Ground , which she took up . That where the deceased fell there was a Bench , and he might probably fall with his Head against that Bench . Charles Woodward , the other Watchman , depos 'd That as they were going to the Round House , the deceased and two more of his Company , fell upon the Prisoner , and that he went and pull 'd them from him one after another . That then two of them fell upon him and his Hat and Wig were fallen off , and his Clothes torn very much . The Prisoner called several Persons to his Reputation , which gave him the Character of a peaceable Person . The Jury considering the Matter found him guilty of Manslaughter only . Burnt in the Hand . Charles Macarty , of the Parish of St. Dunstan 's Stepney , was indicted for a Rape Committed on the Body of Elizabeth Hall , of the Age of 10 Years , the 5th of this Instant January . Thomas Anderson depos 'd That the Prisoner being employ 'd to make Fires in the House of Captain Kerby at Blackwall , a Person desiring to see the House , he went to shew the Person some of the Rooms , and saw the Prisoner , with the Girl between his Knees , in a suspicious posture ; that at his and the other Person 's entering the Room the Prisoner and Girl went away : that going afterwards through three Rooms into another Room , he saw the Prisoner and Girl come out of Closet together . Rebecca Bradford depos 'd That being call 'd to examine the Girl , found that she had receiv 'd a great deal of Damage , by the Pressure of the Parts . Another depos 'd to the same purpose , adding , That it was her Opinion , she had been lain with . The Girl being call 'd to give Evidence , and interrogated , Whether she understood the Nature of an Oath , not giving a satisfactory Answer to the Court , was not admitted to be a Witness . And the Evidence not being sufficient , the Prisoner was acquitted . Ann Leak , of the Parish of St. Buttolph without Aldgate , was indicted for the Murder of her Bastard Male Infant , the 8th of January last , by smothering it in a Cloth , She was also indicted a Second Time on the Coroners Inquest for the Same . Katherine Reader depos 'd That going up stairs , she saw the Prisoner sitting in a Chair , who told her she was very ill ; to which she reply 'd , That appear 'd by her Countenance , for she look 'd as if she was struck with Death : That she ask 'd her for some Sack , she gave her some , and she fainted away ; that then she endeavoured to recover her , and having done it , got her to Bed ; and perceiving a great deal of Blood , she went down and acquainted her Mistress . Her Mistress depos 'd That she suspecting her being with Child about a Month before , had tax 'd the Prisoner with it , and the Prisoner said , She wondred she had such hard Thoughts of her ; and that she had given her Warning about a Fortnight before her Delivery . That being inform 'd by Katherine Reader of her being ill , she went up , and having examined her Linnen , and seeing nothing of a Child , thought there had been only a Miscarriage . That the next Day she sent for a Midwife , and upon her examining the Prisoner , and being of Opinion there had been a Child born , they charg 'd it very home upon the Prisoner . Mrs. Sims the Midwife depos 'd , That she being sent for the Night after , did examine the Prisoner , and finding there had been a Child born , urged her to tell where it was : That after having directed to 2 or 3 Places where it was not , the Prisoner turn 'd aside the Pillow , and there was the Child , ty 'd up pretty fast in a Cloth . That she own 'd it was born alive , and said she did call for help so loud , that had it not been for the Rattling of the Coaches in the Street , and the Crying of Two Children in the Nursery , she must needs have been heard . The Midwife farther depos 'd , She did believe the Child was at its full Time , and was born alive ; that she did not perceive any Marks of Violence offered to it , but 2 Specks on the Forehead , which she believed happened by its falling from the Prisoner on the Ground . The Prisoner in her Defence deny 'd that the Child was born alive , said she had made Provision for it , and that she was a married Woman . And to prove this she call 'd several Persons . Her Mistress own 'd that she hir 'd her as a married Woman . A Master and Mistress with whom she had liv 'd before deposed , That a Person had several Times came to demand her away as his Wife , and had been very troublesome ; that she had owned she was his Wife , but that he was so great a Rogue to her she could not live with him , he having 2 or 3 other Wives . This last Evidence exempting her from the Statute on which the Indictment was founded , the Jury Acquitted her . Mary Radford , of the Parish of St. Martin in the Fields , Spinster , was indicted for the Murder of her Bastard Female Infant , the 18th of December last . She was also indicted a Second Time on the Coroner 's Inquest for the same . Mrs. Dickson , her Mistress , deposed , That the Prisoner having a Day or two before , complain 'd that she had hurt her Back by lifting a Washing-Tub , she gave her something and sent her to Bed : That in the Morning she said she was something better , but afterwards complain 'd again ; that she having laid down on a Bed , on which her Father , who was not well , wanted to lie down , she sent a Lad up to bid her come down : That the Boy came down and told her that Mrs . Steward , a Woman who liv 'd in the House , desir 'd her to come up immediately , for something was the Matter with the Prisoner . That thereupon she went up , and Mrs . Steward , and her self examining her , did think there had been a Miscarriage . That the Prisoner not owning any Child , she at last sent for some Neighbours , and a Midwife , and being search 'd , the Midwife was of Opinion there had been a Child born . She gave no Account of it , but at last it was found under the Stairs in a Chamber-Pot . That the Jaw-Bone of it was broke ; and the Side of the Check torn : That having wash 'd it in warm Water , it bled at the Wound . That the Child had Hair and Nails , that it was very small and lean . Mrs . Steward confirm 'd what the former Witnesses had deposed , adding , That the Occasion of her bidding the Boy bid his Mistress come , was , That he inquiring of her which was the Way to the Prisoner 's Chamber , told her there was Blood on the Landing-Place of the Stairs , which she taking notice of , did suspect something more than ordinary . Another Evidence depos 'd several Things before depos 'd , relating to the Child when found , adding , That the Prisoner said she had done nothing to it , but turned it in the Chamber-Pot . The Midwife-deposed , it was her Opinion that the Child was at its full Time , and that it was born alive ; and the rather , ( which is usual ) because it had a Stool after it came into the World . The Evidences generally were of Opinion , That the Jawbone of the Child might be broken , and the Wound received , by the Child 's falling on or into the Chamber-Pot , and that they perceiv 'd no other Marks of Violence upon it but those . The Mistress and several others gave the Prisoner the Character of a very silly Creature ; that she was a half natural , and that her Mother was so before her ; and the Prisoner 's Aunt deposed , That the Prisoner herself was born without a Midwife , and the Prisoner 's Mother , and , as it was said , Grandmother , in like Manner . The Prisoner in her Defence said , That she knock 'd for Help as loud as she could , but no Body came to her , and that she did not murder the Child . The Prisoner 's Case being evidently within the Statute for Bastard Children , the Jury found her Guilty of both indictments . Death . Edward Fox , of the Parish of St. Sepulchres , was indicted for assaulting and carnally knowing Susannah Mitchel , an Infant of 10 years of Age , without her Consent , the 17th of December last . Susannah Mitchel depos 'd , that she having been at the Necessary House , in a Back Yard , between 12 and 1 a-Clock , on the 17th of December , the Prisoner came and took hold of her , and push 'd her up against a Dust-Cart , and stopping her Mouth with one Hand , took up her Clothes with the other , then put it behind her Back , and put something to the Bottom of her Belly , which hurt her very much . That she was not consenting ; and that he afterwards threatned her , That if she told any Body of it , he would cut her Tongue out . Her Mistress deposed , That she was a Lodger in the House where the Prisoner was an Apprentice . That on the Sunday following perceiving the Girl 's Linnen not as it ought to be examin 'd the Girl what ailed her , and having acquainted a Friend with the Matter , search 'd her , and found she had been very much abused and damaged , was very sore and raw , and had a Running upon her : That threatning to whip her , she confess 'd the Prisoner had done it . A Midwife deposed , she had examined the Girl , and found her very much injur 'd and did believe she had been lain with , and her Body penetrated . Two surgeons were called , who both agreed , That a Girl had been much injured , and that there was a great Inflammation of the Parts , but did not believe the Girl was infected , yet were of Opinion , That Endeavours had been used to force her : and one of them did believe the Girl 's Body had been a little Way entered , but the other said he did not . But by means of a Mistake in the Indictment , the Prisoner was Acquitted upon that Indictment , but continu 'd in Custody till the next Sessions , and the Prosecutor and Evidence were all bound over to prosecute the Prisoner upon a new Indictment . John England , of the Parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for feloniously stealing three Hundred Slates , value 9 s. the Goods of John Barns , the 9th of September last . But no Evidence appearing against the Prisoner he was acquitted . William Shirley , of the Parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for stealing 2 s. 6 d. from John Watts , the 7th of October last .
