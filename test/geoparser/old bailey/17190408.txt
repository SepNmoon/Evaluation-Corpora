By the Evidence to support this Indictment , it appeared that Mr. Carrent gave Carlile 15 l. and ordered him to prosecute the said Smith , and that he paid 5 s. to Mrs. Holiday in New Prison to keep her on , not doubting but she 'd swear any thing against Smith , and order 'd Mr. Carlile to pay 14 s a Week to Mr. Holiday and his Wife to keep them in the Prison , and that they were to give Evidence against Mr. smith for abetting and procuring the robbing the Bristol Mail , and if he was convicted they were to have the 40 , if not Carrent was to pay all Charges : that Carrent should say to Carlisle , you know Smith to be a Rogue , prosecute him to the utmost Rigour of Law ; and that if he was convicted he should not be pardoned for he would make interest to a great Nobleman ; that about two Years ago Carrent said that smith was a Rogue had soft him a great deal of Money , and he would have him convicted if he could , tho ' it cost him a Thousand Pound The Counsel for Carrent observed that even what was swore against him , supposing it to be true , would not make good the indictment and then called Mrs. Scott . and Mrs. Holiday , by whose Evidence it appeared , that Smith had own 'd , that tho ' he did not rob the Bristol Mile yet he set the Robbery ; and that he said if those who did it had not been Fools they had all been made Men .
