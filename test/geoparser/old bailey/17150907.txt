When he came to Mullins , he seem 'd to like the great Piece , and bid the Servant carry home the other , and send his Master to take his Money ; as accordingly he did ; but when Mr. Coleman came , the Prisoner ( Murray being gone before pretending to fetch a Taylor ) was gone away with the Goods . Upon this Mr. Coleman went immediately to the Water-side , and enquir 'd after the Prisoner ; and having learnt of a Waterman , that he took Boat there , the Prosecutor with his Servant took another to pursue him , and at last met the Prisoner 's Waterman coming back : who , being ask 'd where he landed his Passenger , said at the Horse Ferry , and that he saw him go into the White Heart .

Murray in his Defence said , He thought the Goods were paid for ; And Mullins own 'd he took them away , but 't was in a fright ; for seeing two Bailiffs almost at the Paul 's Head Door , he thought they wanted him , which made him slip away , and in his hast took the Goods with him .
