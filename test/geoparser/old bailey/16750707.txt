A Narrative of the Proceedings at the General Quarter Sessions holden at the Old-Bayly upon Wednesday the 7th of this instant July . AT the Sessions at the Old-Bayly , there begun the 7th of July instant , were Tryed a great number of Malafactors , for Crimes of various and sundry natures , as Murthers , Robberies , Burglaries , Cheats , Libellers , and other Enormities ; whereby we see that Vice hath not only an infectuous quality of spreading its Venome ; but that it 's Poison , like that of a Viper , or Adder , doth taint the conversation of sinful Societies , with varigated and multiform tinctures of Impieties , so that it is strange to see what a speked mass of loathsome crimes present themselves at these times amongst the wicked Heard that are brought before this great Tribunal , to receive the due reward of their wickedness . First , here were Tryed two men for Horse-stealing , they made a plausible story for themselves , but the fact was evidently proved against them , and they were found guilty of the Felony upon two several Indictments brought in against them . The next was a Swede as he pretended himself to be , who had learnt the old English trick of being too familiar with mens Pocket concerns , and for the taking away 15. shillings out of the Pocket of his Prosecutors , was likewise convicted of Felony . [ Death . See summary . ] An Indictment was likewise brought against a French woman , formerly a Servant to a person of quality for taking away a parcel of Jewels , Rings , and other Rich commodities , ( formerly mentioned in the Gazett ) of several hundred pounds value , being an Alien , she had the priviledge to have a mixt Jury de medie at Lingue , of French and English ; she understood English pretty well , but could not speak it ; The Tryal was very long by reason of the many circumstances that were brought in to confirm the evidence ; The chief of which were that the same Night the Jewels were lost , she was heard walking about 1. and 2. of the clock in her Ladies Chamber , that presently after she feigned her self Sick , and was thereupon removed to another House , she staid not there long , but removed her self to Leicester-fields , where she was found out by a Foot-man , and appear 'd to be very well , and searching her Trunk , they found some parcels of Lace that the Lady said was in the Coffer out of which she lost aforesaid Jewels . There were then several Testimonies given in of some debauched practices that were observed by her with one that pretended to be her Husband , for which being by the Justice sent to Bridewell , and there received her punishment ; The Gentleman her Gallant , disowned her , and would have nothing to do with her , but these circumstances not amounting to direct proof what she was charged with , though they did too evidently prove the looseness of her conversation ; her defence was given at large by her Interpreters , wherein she answered to several of the most material charges in the evidence given in against her , and upon the whole matter , the Jury brought her in not guilty . There was likewise tryed that unhappy creature that kill 'd her Husband at Goodmans Fields , viz . Elizabeth Lylliman ; she seem 'd to be a person of some 50 years of age , old both in years and wickedness ; her carriage was very strange both at her Arraignment and Tryal , for after her Indictment read , and the the Clark demanded her Plea to the same , she fell into a kind of passion , and desired of the Court that she might see her dear Husband before she pleaded , which she insisted upon with seeming earnestness for some time ; but this appeared to the Court to be but a mad kind of Artifice , designed out of her feigned passionate Zeal to her Murthered Husband to take off the suspicion of her being instrumental to his death , but this would not serve the turn , for upon her Tryal the Fact was evidently proved against her by several witnesses , the people of the house where they were when the Murther was done , did attest how that a little time before the Murther , the party murthered , ( having got a dried mackerel for his supper , went out to a Cobler that kept a Stall next adjoyning to the house , and borrowed his knife of him to dress his Fish ; that while the Fish was a broyling , the people of the house being gon out of the Room , at their return , they found poor Lylliman with the aforesaid knife in his body , and the blood streaming out after it in this condition , nevertheless he had so much strength as to go to the door , and called to the Cobler of whom he borrowed the knife , to come to him , and then imbracing him , cryed out dear Countryman , my wife has stab 'd me with a knife I borrowed of you , which words he reiterated 3 or 4 times , and then sunk down dead ; The Chirurgion that searched the wound did attest that the knife was entred into his very heart ; notwithstanding all which evidence , this bloody woman had the confidence to deny the Fact , and to pretend her self to be clearly innocent of it ; but it was too evidently proved against her , and the whole matter being left to the Jury , they brought her in guilty of petty Treason . [ Death . See summary . ] A Dutch Gentlemen was here Arraigned for the murther of a Frenchman ; it appeared to be done in a kind of fray , for the prisoner being at a Tavern , drinking of a glass of wine with some company , one of them being the aforesaid Frenchman , would have this Gentleman to pledge it , which he refused to do , whereupon the other gave him a box on the Ear , and fell upon him in a rude and violent manner , whereupon they having shut the doors to them , so that he had no way to escape his fury , he drew his Sword to defend himself , and therewith unhappily kill 'd the French-man , the Jury brought him in only guilty of Manslaughter , so he had the benefit of his clergy . A Gentleman was lately Rob 'd near Lambs Conduit , behind Grayes-Inn , by some persons that were upon the Foot-pad that way , they took from one a Silver headed Sword , a watch , and other things of good value , two persons were taken upon suspicion and arraigned at this Sessions , whereof one of them was found guilty , the other was acquitted . [ Death . See summary . ] There were two several Indictments brought in against a Woman [ Rose Goodman ] for the Felonious taking away of Cloaths from the persons of two children , her Trade had been it seems to intice little children that she found in the Streets , to go along with her , and having got them in some private place remote from their dwellings , and their strip them of their cloaths , and after sold them , leaving the poor children in that pitiful condition to shift for themselves ; thus she had serv 'd several ; she was found guilty upon both Indictments , and no doubt will be made an example . [ Death . See summary . ] One living in Chancery-Lane , was Indicted for ravishing a girle about 15. years of age , together with a young Woman in whose house the same was pretended to be done , as accessary , by assisting to the Fact ; The fact according to the circumstances that are usually made use of in such cases , was peremptorily attested by the Girle and her Parents , but the witnesses for he Prisoner , who were very many , and seemed to be most of them persons of good account , did first give a very fair testimony of him upon their knowledge of him , and then did so fully testify by numerous circumstances , the lewdness of the Girle and her mother ; and that the Girle as young and innocent as she seemed , had been notoriously known to be lewd , lascivious , and disorderly , and that they had by plain proofs only laid this design to get a peice of mony from him , these evidences being considered , the Jury brought him in not guilty . After these a pretended Printer was brought to the Bar , he had been convicted upon two several Indictments , the one for Exercising the Mystery of Printing , not being of the same , ( but formerly a Scrivener ) and the other for Printing Scandalous Libels ; he pleaded for himself , that he had lived an house-keeper in good fashion , and that if he should be put to any publick disgrace , it would be the ruine of himself and a great family that he had under his charge , and pleaded the favour of the Court ; who taking it into consideration , and it being the first offence that he stood convicted of , were pleased only to set a Fine upon him of 5 l. which he was to pay before he should be released from prison , and to prohibit him from Exercising or using the Trade of Printing for three years to come . There were two persons that had been convicted of forging Tickets , they had judgment to stand in the Pillory three several days , and fined . The last were five persons , three men and two women , for petty larceny , who had judgement to be whipt at the Carts Tail . Thus we have given you a brief account of the most remarkable Trials of this Sessions , which was very great , and took up much time , holding from Wensday until Saturday following 2 a clock , the last thing remaning is to give you an account of the Several Judgements and Condemnations that past upon the Malefactors . And first those that were capable of being admitted to the benefit of their Clergy were called to the bar , and some that could read desired that benefit , others prayed Transportation which was granted them as the Court saw cause ; The Number of these to be transported were 6 in all 3 men and 3 women ; The Number of those burned in the hand were 10 whereof six were men and 4 women , after which those who were to receive Judgement of death were set to the barre , and accordingly tyed up , which were 9 men and 2 women , eleven in all , whereof ten had judgement to be hanged , whereof several of them were for the aforementioned burglaries , one was a Pickpocket , two others for robbing upon the high-way , and the woman that stripped the Children of their cloaths . After judgment , she pleaded she was with Child , and thereupon a jury of matrons were impannelled to inspect her , who returned upon their Oaths that they did not find that she was quick with Child , so she was set by for Execution with the rest of the Condemned persons . Elizabeth Lillyman , the person that killed her husband , her crime being petty Treason , had judgment to be burned to ashes , when she came to the Bar , she did , as formerly , passionately request to see the body of her husband before she died , saying she could not else dye in peace . But this action of hers , was suspected rather as a fit of raving , then the result of a considerate mind , from one who was so apparently proved to be his Murtheress .
