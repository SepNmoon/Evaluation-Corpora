I lost a large Copper Funnel between the Hours of Seven and Two . Q . Where did you find it ? Lowrey . At a Broker 's in Moorfields . Q . Who first inform 'd you where this Funnel was ? Lowrey . The Broker , my Lord . Q . What is the Broker 's Name ? Lowrey . David Carter . Q . ( to David Carter ) Are you the Broker ? Carter . Yes . Q . What have you to say touching the Matter now in Question ? Carter . My Lord . Upon the 9th of February , between Eight and Nine o'Clock in the Morning , Robert Wilson , the Prisoner at the Bar , brought to me a large Copper Funnel . Q . To what Purpose did he bring it to you ? Carter . To sell , my Lord . He ask 'd me 14 d. the Pound for it . I ask 'd him what it was . He said it was the Head of a large Furnace . I ask 'd him what he was , and he said , a Distiller . I said it was very odd , that you should be a Distiller , and ignorant what it was . My Lord , he told me that he liv 'd at Henly upon Thames , that he was a Distiller , had come to Misfortunes , and must sell it . So when I question 'd him about it , he said , if you do n't like it , or do n't think that I came honestly by it , I 'll leave it , and go fetch a Person to my Character . With that I told him I would not have the Things left , without he said himself . At last , a Gentlewoman , a Widow of a Common-Council-Man of our Ward , who was some Relation to the Prisoner 's Father , desir 'd me not to charge an Officer with him . He equivocated in several Shapes . At last , he said , his Wife had bought these Things of a Woman that sold Rags and old Iron . Said I , what do you imagine your Wife might give for it ? He insisted upon it , that she might give a Great 2 Pound . He told me his Father liv 'd in St. Giles 's , and also his Brother . They directed me to the Prisoner 's House , but his Wife deny 'd him . I went in the Broad-Way , Westminster . I ask 'd there , if there were not several Gentlemen that keep Distiller 's Shops thereabouts . Pray do you know any one in particular , I said . They said , pray what is your Business ? This Morning I stopp 'd a Copper Funnel , which I imagine was some Gentleman 's Property hereabouts , because the Person lives hereabouts that brought it . Upon this we went to a Person of the Business , Mr. Lowrey ; and it appear 'd that he was the Person that had lost the Funnel . Upon that we charg 'd the Constable with the Prisoner . From that we went before the Justice and he was committed upon a Suspicion , because then Mr. Lowrey had not seen it . The next Day Mr. Lowrey came to me to see the Funnel , and swore it was his . Q . ( to Lowrey ) Look upon that Funnel : Is it yours ? Lowrey . Yes . This is what I lost the 4th of February . Q . ( to the Broker ) Is that what you stopp 'd ? Broker . It is what I stopp 'd . Council for the Prisoner . My Lord please to observe that any Confession the Woman may make , must be against herself , it wont do against the other . He is charg 'd in the Indictment with being the Principal . Carter . He confess 'd before the Justice that he gave a Groat a Pound for it . Q . Did he confess he stood by when it was stole ? Carter . No . Q . ( to the Broker ) Who brought the Copper to you ? Broker . The Prisoner brought it to me . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) What have you to say ? Prisoner , This Man , when I came to bring the Funnel , stopp 'd me : I emptied it out of my Sack , and they desir 'd me to sit down by the Fire , and I sat down . They brought a parcel of People into the House , and stopp 'd me and frighted me . They ask 'd me whether I had any Money in my Pocket . But the Broker said , he would stop me with it , but not charge me with the Constable , and wanted me to run away . I sent to my Father to Broad St. Giles 's ; and when my Brother came , he made him Pay 6 d. for sending his own Boy . The Broker told me I had a pretty deal of Impudence to ask 10 d. the Pound for it . Council for the Prisoner . I 'll only mention this , that if this Man had been conscious he had committed the Felony , 't is certain he might have made his Escape . Barthia Whitefield . I went to Mr. Wilson 's , the Prisoner ; he said to me , do n't you never light on no Copper Pots , no distilling Things , I can see them lie about in Shops . The first Thing I ever took was two Funnels , and he bought them of me . About a Fortnight after , I took this large Funnel . I was in Company with him at the Time I took it . He said , the Shop is clear , you may now take it . He receiv 'd it of me , and gave me 3 d. the Pound for it . Q . ( to Theodosia Clarke ) Do you know any Thing of taking up Barthia Whitefield at the Bar ? What do you know of it ? Clarke . I had a Crown Reward to take her . Q . Where was Wilson all this while ? Clarke In the Gatehouse . Q . Had you some Reward for taking of her up ? Clarke . Yes . Of Wilson 's Spouse . She said , if you can catch her , I will give you a Crown . It was answer 'd Whitefield had never absconded at all . Q . ( to Samuel Cherry ) You are call 'd to give an Account of Robert Wilson , what Character does he bear in his Neighbourhood ? Cherry . I never saw any Thing by the Man , but that he was just and honest in all his Dealings . Q . Have you any Sort of Acquaintance with him ? Cherry . I have seen People come to buy Rags , Bottles , & c. of him . Q . You say he liv 'd by you two Years , and you know no Ill of him . Cherry . No . Q . ( to Elizabeth Franklin ) How long have you known the Prisoner at the Bar ? Franklin . Very near two Years , Sir . Q . What Character does he bear in his Neighbourhood ? Franklin .

I live in the Neighbourhood , have no Acquaintance or Dealings any farther than good Night and good Morrow . Q . ( to Mary Cooper ) You are call 'd to give an Account of Robert Wilson ; how long have you known him ? Cooper . About two Years . Q .

Hughs . No , Sir . ( to Sarah Smith ) You are call 'd upon to the Character of the Prisoner at the Bar : Do you know any Thing of him ? Smith . Yes , I know him and his Father . I believe him to be a very honest Person . In order to set this Matter in a clearer Light , we shall give the Close of his Lordship 's Charge to the Jury . Gentlemen , you are to put the whole Matter together . The Evidence seems to lie pretty strong against Wilson . His having stolen the Goods in Possession , carrying them about in a suspicious Manner , as I find he was found in three different Stories , these are strong presumptive Evidences of Guilt . What he has to take off that Presumption was , that he was instrumental in apprehending of Barthia Whitefield ; if you would make any Use of her Evidence , it must be taken together : That is , that she did steal it , but that Wilson was present at the Time that she took it . Both Guilty . Wilson to be transported for 14 years , and the Girl for seven . 104.

She put her Hand into my Pocket and took out two Half Crowns , a new Six-pence and some Farthings , to the best of my Knowledge three Half-pence . When she took it out I felt her Hand in my Pocket , but I did not seize her immediately , because I could not see the Watchmen about . Thinks I , when I see a proper Watchman I 'll charge you with it . There were three of the Creatures . When they came down Foster-Lane , says she ( the Prisoner ) I 'll go Home this Way ; says I , I can go Home this Way too . When I saw the Watchman upon the Stand I took immediately hold of her Arm ; I said , you have robb 'd me of such and such Money . When we came to the Watchman , as she is a common Creature that every one knows , I said , you robb 'd me ; she express 'd herself in a Way I can not express . I have a Husband , and I have got a Child almost nine Years old ; I told her , I did not know what she meant by it ; I do n't desire , I said , any further Law ; but I would have my own . Says the Constable , give this poor Woman her Money , if you have robb 'd her ; and if you insist upon it , good Woman , she must go to the Compter . Says I , she has robb 'd me . When she came to the Compter Gate , oh ! says she , I 'll give twenty Half-Crowns , I 'll give you your Money again to let me free . Please you , my Lord , we went to the Compter ; when we went before the Alderman , oh , says he , Elizabeth Hooker , I know you to belong to a Gang of Thieves in Cheek-Lane , you come often upon such Affairs , I must commit you .

My Lord , I have known the Witness these twenty Years ; she has been try 'd several Times here ; she has stood in the Pillory three Times : My Lord , she charg 'd another Woman with the Robbery as well as me . She ask 'd me to go to drink with her . Enquire her Character . Coming down Honey-Lane Market , the Prosecutor standing by the Door , she ask 'd me to go and drink with her ; she insisted I should go and drink along with her . I follow 'd down all Cheapside : As I came down there , there came along a Man with a Link in his Hand . The Prosecutor insisted I should drink with her , or else , she told me , it would be the worse for me . Says she , here is the Watchman , I 'll charge you with stealing two Half-Crowns , and a new Sixpence , and three Halfpence . I said , You Watchman , see I throw nothing out of my Pocket .

What the Prisoner says is all false ; she was not search 'd in the Watch-house by the Constable , nor any one else . Q . Was she search 'd at the Compter ? Mason . She offer 'd rather to give twenty Half-Crowns than go to the Compter . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) You have said that the Witness , Rachel North , has been convicted of Perjury ; if you object that against her , you must prove it . Prisoner .

I had known her by coming up and down the Street . Phillis , said I , how do you do ; if you think proper to go my Way , you shall partake of the Light of my Link : With that , this Woman insisted upon the Prisoner at the Bar to drink ; the Prisoner made Answer , she would not drink with her at all , she did not like her . The Prosecutor answer 'd , If you wo n't drink with me it will be worse for you by and by . With that , I said to Phillis at the Bar , I ca n't stay , God bless you , I wish you good Night . In about two or three Days after she sent for me to Wood-Street Compter : That is all I know of it . Q . ( to the Prosecutor ) Did you see this Porter ? Prosecutor .

James Raven of the Parish of Stoke-Newington , not having the Fear of God before his Eyes , on the 31st of July , feloniously committed a Rape on the Body of Mary Irish . Court . ( to Irish ) I find the Prisoner at the Bar is charg 'd with committing a Rape on your Body . Irish . I liv 'd at Kingsland , at one Mr . Butter 's . On the 31st of July I was going to my Master 's House . Going on an Errand , this young Man met me , and two more . Two held my Leggs , the other stopp 'd my Mouth with his Hand . I was going for my Master 's Cows when this young Man met me ; I got from him , but he follow 'd me and threw me into the Ditch . Q . How many in Company were there ? Irish . Four . Two held my Legs , one stopp 'd my Mouth . Q . What did the Prisoner do to you ? Irish . The young Man the Prisoner lay with me . Court . I find you are a marry 'd Woman , you understand what is meant by lying with you . Had he Knowledge of your Body , as your Husband has had ? Irish . Yes . Q . Had he this Knowledge of you whilst these two People held your Legs and the other stopp 'd your Mouth ? Irish . Yes . Court . This you say was on the 31st of July last . Irish . Yes . Q . How happen 'd this Prosecution was not commenced before now ? Irish . I could not find the Person out . When I went home to my Master and Mistress , I complain 'd sadly that I had been us 'd at this Rate . Court . You say you complain 'd to your Master and Mistress at the same Time , the same Evening . Irish . Yes . Q . What Time of the Day was this ? Irish . At Eleven o'Clock in the Morning . Q . Where was this ? Irish . By the Highway between Kingsland and Newington , the Corner of the Fields ? Court . And was this about Eleven o'Clock in the Morning . Irish . Yes , Sir , Eleven o'Clock in the Morning . Court . Look upon the Prisoner at the Bar , was he one of the Persons ? Irish . That was the young Man that lay with me . Q . Was there any Person near that knew any Thing of it ? Irish . There was a young Woman in the Field , pretty near , that spoke to me about it three Weeks after . Court . You say this Woman in the Field told you of it three Weeks after ; when did you come to know that the Prisoner at the Bar was concern 'd in it ? Irish . She told me she knew them all . This was Weeks after the Fact . Q . When did you take up the Prisoner at the Bar ? Irish . Lately . Q . How happen 'd it you did not take him up before ? Irish . I had never a Friend to stir in it , to take him up . Q . Where did you find the Prisoner ? Irish . At his own House in Old-Street . Q . This Woman told you three Weeks after the Fact was committed , that he liv 'd with his Father , and that his Father was a Housekeeper in Old-Street . This Person that told you the Prisoner at the Bar was one of the Persons , could she tell you who the others were ? Irish . She only knew the Prisoner at the Bar . Q . And this Relation you had three Weeks after the Fact . Irish . Yes . Q . Has your Father never been about getting some Money of this Man to make it up ? Irish . Not as I know of . Q . What Highway was this ; is it not a publick Road ? Irish . Yes , Sir . Q . And if this Woman in the Field could see this Fact ; if you had scream 'd out , all these Pease-pickers must have heard you . What , none of these come to your Assistance ? For these Pease-pickers were in Sight as well as this Woman . Did you tell any other Neighbour , or any other Person besides your Master and Mistress , of it ? Were you got with Child by this Time ? Irish . Yes , Sir . Q . ( to Anne Price ) What do you know of this Matter ? Price . I was in the Pease-Field , I heard Murder cry 'd out . It was of a Tuesday , in the Pease Season . And coming along , who should we see but young Raven run over the Field . And he went to hurl Stones and Dirt at us . There came a Fellow up in a red Waistcoate , and swore , I 'll have your Legs open . I saw nothing any farther . Q . Where is this Pease-Field ? Price . In the further Side of the Road . Q . Where were these People ? Price . They were running out of the Room Q . Therefore you saw him first in the Road , that he run over the Fields , the other Side of the Road : so that the first Sight you had of him was in the Road that parts these two Fields . When did you see that Woman afterwards ? Price . The next Day , and her Mistress was forced to put her to Bed . Q . You saw him running , and this you told her the very next Day . Price . Yes . Q . ( to Mary Edwards ) What have you to say of the Prisoner at the Bar , touching this Matter ? Edwards . Please you my Lord , we were in the Pease-Field , and heard Murder cry 'd . With that I went out of the Field , I saw the Man in the Ditch , and could see nothing but the Woman 's Cap and Sleeve of her Gown . Q . Did you see the Prisoner at the Bar ? Edwards . Yes , please you my Lord . In some Time after they run over the Fields ; and one of them said , the Bitch was not willing , but I help 'd to hold her Legs . Q . Did you see the Prosecutor that Night ? Edwards . I ca n't say I ever saw her since that Time , before Yesterday . Q . Then she was gone before the Men came away . Edwards . She was gone before we got to the Side of the Hedge . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Now is your Time for making your Defence . Prisoner . Please you my Lord , I was not there that Day this Thing happen 'd : Nor ever saw the Woman in the whole Course of my Life , 'till I was taken up . Q . ( to - Turner ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Do you know any Thing of the Prosecutor 's Father-in-Law offering to make it up ? Turner . That he had a Warrant to take up Mr. Raven 's Son . He said , the Matter would be made up on pretty easy Terms . The Prisoner 's Father and I took him into a Room . We put it to him , have you been guilty of such a Thing ? He answer 'd , no , if he was to be hang 'd at the Door . And after the Prosecutor 's Father came to my House , and ask 'd what we intended to do . That Warrant we took out is not strong enough , but the second is . The Father did say he tore the first Warrant . I told the Justice it was not tore . Q. I ask you whether from July to this Time , this young Fellow absconded from his Business . Turner . No , not at all . Q . Now I ask you what Character has the young Man borne ? Turner . A very good one . I never knew or saw any such Thing of him . Q . ( to Raven ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Raven . Yes , Sir . I am his Uncle . He has work 'd with me backwards and forwards for some Years , and quite as honest a Lad as any in England . Q . You think he is a sober , honest Lad , that would not be guilty with such a Woman . Raven . No . Q . Now , I would ask you , from July to this Time has he ever absconded ? Raven . No , never ; but carry 'd out Beer constantly . Samuel Gould . I never heard any ill Word out of his Mouth , ever since he has come to my House , he has been publick in Business ever since this Fact is said to have been committed . Q . Did you take him to be a sober Lad , or a prostigate Lad , that would go to ravish a Woman ? Q . ( to John Bury ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Buoy . I have known him for some Years . Q . Do you think he is a Lad that would do such a Thing ? Buoy . No , he has not Impudence enough for that . He is quite a modest , sober Lad . Q . ( to - Samson ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Samson . I have known him from a Child . Q . What Character has he bore ? Samson . A very modest Character . I never saw him offer to kiss a Girl in my Life . Q . You think he would not be guilty of such an enormous Crime . Samson . No , nothing like it . He has been at my House twice a Week . And I think it wrong in the Prisoner 's Friends that they did not bring more People to his Character : If they would , they might have brought half the Parish . Acquitted . 123. Thomas Camel , indicted for stealing out of the Dwelling-house of Patrick Byrne , two Guineas and Half in Gold , & c. [ To Patrick Byrne . ] Give an Account of what you know the Prisoner at the Bar is charg 'd with . Patrick Byrne . Between Four and Five o'Clock on the 20th of February , the Prisoner robb 'd me of 4 l. 14 s. Q . How do you prove it ? Byrne . He did it by opening a Box . Q . What Pieces were they ? Byrne . Two Guineas and a Half in Gold , and 40 s. in Silver . Q . You say he took this Money out of your House , How do you prove he took it ? Byrne . By leaving his Hat on the Pantiles , under the Window of the Chamber we lie in . Court . Then that Hat gave you a Suspicion ? Byrne . Yes . Q . Where did you take him up ? Byrne . At the Coach and Horses at Whitechapel-Bars . Q . When you had taken him up , what pass 'd then ? Byrne . When we had taken him , he own 'd that he had 4 l. 14 s. that Half a Crown he had spent . ( The Money was produced in Court , in a Box that he had taken it away in . ) Q . Then that Money he own 'd ? Byrne . Yes , Sir . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) Would you ask the Prosecutor any Question ? They say they found the Money upon you , and you own 'd you had taken it out of the Prosecutor 's House . Prisoner . I did not own that I took the Money away . Q . ( to William Bennet . ) What do you say ? Bennet . Please you , my Lord , I was call 'd up by Mr. Byrne between Four and Five o'Clock ; I went to assist him . He search 'd the House , suspecting there might be more than this one that run away . Being dark , and raining very hard , he did not see who it was . In searching about the House , there lay Linnen out of the Box , in one Place and another , and a large Silver Spoon , & c. With that my Man and another Man went to search the House . Q . How came you to suspect the Prisoner at the Bar ? Bennet . In looking out at the Window we saw his Hat , taking it up with a Pair of Tongs , it was half full of Water . Mrs. Byrne said , Here is the Thief 's Hat . Mr. Byrne said , it was Tom 's Hat ; for he had chang 'd , on Shrove-Tuesday , with a young Man at his House , who was then gone to Sea . Mr. Byrne said to me , Mr. Bennet , Will you go and drink a Draught of Purl at the Coach and Horses ? When we went there the Prisoner was sitting without his Hat , and his Wig as wet as Dung . Then we charg 'd him with the Money , and told him , it would be better for him to deliver the Money up again ; which he did , throwing the Money down again , only the Half-Crown he had spent . Q . ( to Mr . Byrne . ) How do you apprehend the Prisoner got into your House ? Byrne . Out of our Skittle-Ground he got in at the Window . John Lobb . Please you , my Lord , this Mr. Bennet call 'd at my Window and said , I beg you would come down , Mr. Byrne 's House is stripp 'd . When I came in they shew 'd me up into the Chamber , where the Cloaths lay about the Room . I and another surrounded the House for fear the Thief should get away , and not be catch 'd . By the Hat we had a Suspicion of the Prisoner ; otherwise none would have had a Suspicion of him , he behaving so well . I went to the Headborough , and he refus 'd coming . We surrounded the House , and I said , We had better go to Justice Quarril . I went with Mr. Byrne to drink a Pint of Purl at the Coach and Horses ; there the Prisoner at the Bar was without his Hat . Mr. Bennet said , We have got the Prisoner . We told him if he would deliver the Money up , we would be favourable to him . He said he had spent Half a Crown of it , and he laid down what remain 'd . Q . ( to Mary Byrne . ) Can you say any Thing more than your Husband has said ? Mary Byrne . About Four o'Clock I heard a Noise in the Room ; my Husband said he believ 'd it was Rats ; then we thought it might be our Dog : Says my Husband , The Rats may be nibbling at your Boxes ; upon that I struck a Light , and while I was blowing the Tinder to light a Match , somebody run out of the Room ; I scream 'd out , and my Surprize was so great that I could not light the Candle : But we soon got up , and found the Door open , which I suppose he open 'd to run out . When I came to search I found all my Linnen safe , but the Money that was in that Box . There were several particular Pieces : Two or three Pair of Mourning Buckles in that Box he took away ; this Lid I found in the Chimney-Corner . To the best of my Remembrance , there were 18 s. in another Band-Box . In his Hurry , in taking these 17 or 18 s. he took up the Necklace with it . ( The Necklace and Money were produced in Court . ) He is a young Man I should have suspected the least of any body ; he was a young Man that behav 'd very well . The Ruin of this young Man was his keeping Company with a Whore . He said lately , Mrs. Byrne , I wish I had known your House some Months sooner . Q . ( to the Prisoner . ) You have heard what was said against you . Prisoner . I deny that I said I had the Money ; but I said , if I have any Money you shall have it . Q . They say you deliver 'd back the Money , and said this was all you had taken , except the Half-Crown you had spent . At the same Time that you deliver 'd up the Money they found that Necklace upon you , that Mrs. Byrne swears to be hers , and to be lost out of her room that Night . Q . Have you any Witnesses to call ? The Prisoner had very little to say to the Purpose in his Defence . Guilty . Death . The Prosecutors earnestly recommended him to Mercy on Account of his former good Behaviour , and verily believing it to be the first Fact . Also the Jury recommended him to his Majesty 's Mercy . 124 , 125 , 126. John Wareham , Thomas Davis , and Abijah Burk , indicted for robbing Charles Chinner of a Hat , Value 3 s. one Peruke ; Value 2 s. & c. Q . To Charles Chinner . ( He made Answers , as being a Foreigner , by an Interpreter . ) Desire him to look at the Prisoners at the Bar , and ask him if he knows them . Chinner , ( by an Interpreter . ) He says he never saw them before the Time he was robb 'd , which was on the 5th of January , on Sunday Night ; and that one of the Prisoners cut him with a Hanger . Q . Which of them ? Interpreter . He with the red Waistcoat , Abijah Burk . Q . Was his Peruke taken off ? Interpreter . Yes . Q . How came these Boys to be apprehended ? Interpreter . The Substance of what he says is , That the three Prisoners met him at Rag-Fair ; that Abijah Burk cut him with a Hanger , took away his Wig , and John Wareham his Handkerchief . Q . Did any one put his Hand into his Pocket ? Had they any other Arms besides that Hanger ? Interpreter . They had all Cutlasses ; there were four of them . Lovet . Mrs. Frank sent for me , and told me one of her Lodgers was robb 'd in Rag-Fair ; that the Woman would be there by and by who saw the Robbery committed . Upon this they got a Warrant to take up this Abijah Burk . They went to his Lodgings , and found him in Bed : He got out of Bed , and turn 'd it up ; but we turn 'd it down again , and between the Bedcloaths we found the Hanger , and likewise the Hat ; and the Prosecutor said he knew it was his Hat ; it was found under Abijah Burk 's Bed . The Hat and Hanger were produced in Court . Q . ( to Burk . ) Will you ask the Witness any Questions ? He says that the Hanger and Hat were found under your Bed ? The Prisoner could ask no Question at all to the Purpose . Elizabeth Dunbar . Upon the Night the Robbery was committed I was sent by my Master on an Errand : I saw the Prisoner cut the Frenchman over the Head , and the little one put his Hand into the Prosecutor 's Pocket . Q . When was this ? Dunbar . On Sunday Night , the 5th Day of last Month . Q . ( to the Prisoners . ) Would you ask this Witness any Question ? Prisoners . Please you , my Lord , to ask her where she was when she saw this ? Dunbar . At the Chandler 's Shop , getting some Butter , next Door but two to the Pork-Shop . Prisoners . Please you , my Lord , to ask the Prosecutor where he lost these Things ? Q . ( to Chinner . ) Whereabouts was you robb 'd in the Street ? Interpreter . Near Rag-Fair . Q . ( to Elizabeth Dunbar . ) Was it near Rag-Fair ? Dunbar . Yes , I believe about thirty Yards from the Watch-house . Q . Are you sure the Prisoners at the Bar were the Persons ? Dunbar . Yes , Sir ; I could safely swear to all the Three : For that very Night two of them , Wareham and Davis , ran up Stairs , with a Hanger , to kill me . Nathaniel Harris . By the Assistance of this Lovet we went to search Burk 's Lodgings , where we found the Hat and Hanger , which Hat the Prosecutor positively declar 'd was his . The Prisoners could not ask any pertinent Questions , only reproach 'd the Prosecutor and Witnesses . Anne Webley . I nursed Burk 's Wife with a Child for three Weeks , and the while two Girls picking up the Prosecutor , brought him into my Room : With that he call 'd me his Mother ; I your Mother ! I am sure I do n't know you ! Then , says he , will you fetch me a couple of Pots of Beer ; and serching the Beer they ask 'd me whether I could get some Meat . Upon that I went to the Cook 's for Meat , & c. Q . What Countryman is the Prosecutor ? Had you all this Conversation with him ? Can you talk French , or does he talk English ? Burk answer 'd . My Lord , he spoke very good English before the Justice , and when he took us . But this last Witness , Anne Webley , pretty much overshot the Time . Court . If you can not speak nearer to the Time , and more to the Purpose , I 'll hear no more of you . James Powel . About six Weeks ago I was at Burk 's Lodgings , and Burk 's Lodgings were not search 'd 'till the 7th of January . The Court observ 'd that Webley said it was a Fortnight before , or the last Sessions : Now the last Sessions were on the 17th of January . All Guilty of the Felony and Robbery . [ Death . See summary . ] 127. Elizabeth Williams was indicted for stealing a Parcel of Plate out of the House of Mary Abel of St. Martin's-Lane . Q . ( to Mary Abel ) Did you at any Time lose any Goods , and when ? Mary Abel . Please you , my Lord , the Prisoner at the Bar came to my House the latter End of November . Q . When did you lose the Goods out of your House ? Abel . The 6th of December following . Q . What Goods did you lose ? Abel . I lost a Silver Coffee-Pot , a Silver Bason , a Silver Boat , two Silver Spoons , and one Pair of Silver Tongs . Court . You lost them out of this House . Abel . Yes . Q . Upon losing them , how came you to suspect the Prisoner ? Abel . Please you , my Lord , the Prisoner came to my House in the latter End of November : I keep a Tavern in St. Martin 's Lane . She came with a Gentleman to my House ; they had a Pot of Coffee instead of Wine ; so I sent all these Things in . I had known the Person that was with her for 30 Years ; and the Things came out again . On December the 6th the Prisoner afterwards came again . Q . What Time of the Day or Night ? Abel . About Four o'Clock in the Afternoon : Says she , do you remember me ; I answer 'd , Yes . Pray , says the Prisoner , make me a Pot of Coffee : I love Coffee as well as the Gentleman , and the Gentleman is coming again to meet me : Accordingly , I sent the Things in , expecting this Gentleman to come . Upon that I sent the Coffee in , and some Time after my Man went in to see if she had done with the Coffee : She said the Gentleman was not come , and she would keep it hot . She call 'd my Man to go for this Gentleman ; and after she had sent him out , she call 'd for the Maid and sent her out on an Errand too . I had been lame for some Time , and observing that , she took her Opportunity , and immediately went out with all this Plate . Q . Where is this Room ? Abel . 'T is below Stairs ; it was a publick Drinking-Room . Q . You do not mean publick for more Company than one ? Abel . No , my Lord . Q . Did you see her go away ? Abel . No , my Lord . Q . Did she pay for her Coffee ? Abel . No , my Lord ; she went away without being seen . Q . How long after she went did you miss the Things ? Abel . Immediately , my Lord . My Servant , who went out on her Errand , came to give her Answer . When she went up into the Room , she said , Madam , the Plate is gone . Afterwards , I immediately sent to my Friend , and I sent and advertis 'd that very Night . Upon that my Friend came and was vastly surpris 'd . However , he gave me Directions to several Places , but I could not find her . At last , by advertising , she was taken . Q . Where was she carry 'd ? Abel . To Bridewell . Q . Where and when did you see her ? Abel . I saw her in Bridewell . Q . Did you accuse her with these Things ? Abel . Yes , my Lord : And she own 'd them all ; I have a Paper of them that she sign 'd . Q . Did she own the taking these Things before she writ the Paper , did she mention the several Particulars ? Abel . Yes , my Lord . She directed me to those People that have the Plate here . Q . What are their Names ? Abel . Mr. Gardiner , and Mr. Hopmaster . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Would you ask the Prosecutor any Questions ? Prisoner . Please you my Lord , she is an old Bawd , and has kept a bad House these 20 Years . Did I tell you that I took every Thing from you ? Abel . All , but the Spoons and Tongs . Q . ( to - Hopmaster ) Whence had you these Things ; Hopmaster . Mr. Gardiner sold these three Pieces to me . A Silver Bason , Silver Waiter and a Silver Coffee-Pot . Q . Have you any Thing more to say ? Hopmaster . I do n't know the Prisoner at the Bar . Mr. Gardiner recommended this Woman to me , said , here is some Silver a Gentlewoman in my Shop has to sell . I answer 'd , I do n't know how to buy it at present . I hear it is fallen . So Mr. Gardiner said , it was 5 s. 3 d. an Ounce , he had enquir 'd ; so I gave him that Money for it . Q . Look at the Prisoner at the Bar ; was she present ? Hopmaster . No , my Lord , she was not . I know nothing of the Prisoner . I bought these Things of Mr. Gardiner . On a Saturday Evening , just as I was going out , the Prisoner at the Bar came , and said , did not you buy some Silver belonging to me , of Mr. Gardiner . I have a Lawyer I employ , I must give him some Money this Day . The Coffee-Pot I bought of the Prisoner , thro ' Mr Gardiner 's Recommendation . Mr. Gardiner call 'd at my House afterwards , and ask 'd if I had not bought the Coffee-Pot . Gardiner . Please you my Lord , the Prisoner at the Bar came to my Shop and ask 'd for a Gentleman I knew nothing of . After she had sat some Time in the shop , she said , she was a very unhappy Lady . That she was an Heiress of 500 l. a Year , and that a Rogue was endeavouring to get her Estate . I said , Madam , if you please to come in , it is very cold . By the Subtlery of the Woman , she wrung Compassion from me and my Wife . Said , she lodg 'd at Kensington . Next Day , she came with Kensington-Stage . She ask 'd me to lend her Three-Pence . She laid a Shilling upon the Dresser , and gave Three-Pence to the Coachman . She came and turn 'd herself round the Shop , and said , she wanted a pair of Scissars , which came to Nine-Pence , which , and the Three-Pence , made the Shilling , and said , I told you I am a very unhappy Lady . Do you know how Plate sells an Ounce . She pull 'd out those Things that were before mention 'd and desir 'd me to sell them for her . said I , Madam , how can you repose such a Confidence in me ? Do you know the Weight of them . No , I do n't . Oh ! Says she , I have had such a Character of you , I could trust you with 5000 l. And accordingly I went with the Plate , and sold it to Mr. Hopmaster . She told me she was a Relation of Sir Watkin William 's . I went to enquire of his Gentleman , who had liv 'd with him many Years , and who knew the Family exceeding well , whether there was such a one as Counsellor Williams , of Hertfordshire , who had left an only Daughter : But he knew of no such Person . She said she had an immense deal of Plate to sell , in order to defray her Expences in Law , Come says she , I love to be grateful . Madam , you say you are necessitous , I do n't desire you to lay out any Thing with me . She look 'd in my Glass , and fix 'd her Eyes upon a Ring , and ask 'd me the Price of it . Madam , I said , it cost me 18 s. and I never will sell it under . Says she , there is a Gentleman , one Mr. Ross , a Linnendraper , I purpose to buy this Ring , and make a Present of it to him . So she bought the Ring and away she went , and din 'd with me the next Day . This Woman look 'd reputable enough . On purpose to satisfy my Curiosity , to see if she had any more Family Plate . So on Saturday , while I was gone out , my Cousin told her I had sold it at Mr. Hopmaster 's . So my Lord , I gave her an Invitation to come again and dine with me . And I din 'd with her one Sunday at a reputable Distiller 's , one Mr. Williams , and Ross gave her a good Character , and said she was a Lady of Fortune . Still I could not be easy , I thought it was an Oddity , that Sir Watkin 's Butler , who had known the Family , could give no Account of her . So my Lord , on the Fast-Day at Night , Mr. Winsmore came to me , and said , pray do n't you sell Case-Knives . He was about to keep a publick H ouse , they pretended to be Husband and Wife . The Prisoner at the Bar had told somebody that she had lodg 'd and boarded at my House . After we had made an Agreement about the Knives , he wanted a Bed for his Wife . I said I had a Gentlewoman that lodg 'd with my Cousin , and I told the Tale . Then Mr. Winsmore said , if you do n't produce the Prisoner I will put you in Newgate . She has made an Elopement from Clerkenwell . There are five Guineas for taking her . Accordingly we call 'd a Coach and we found her in Bed . Upon this she was retaken and carry 'd to Clerkenwell Prison . Q . Upon your seeing her in Custody , was any Body sent to about the Plate ? Gardiner . No , my Lord . Q . Did you hear her make any Confession about the Plate . All that you say is , that she deliver 'd that Plate to you and desir 'd you to sell it . And you sold it accordingly . Gardiner . Yes , my Lord . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Would you ask the Witness any Questions ? Prisoner . No . Mary Thomson . I serv 'd the Prisoner at the Bar with this Plate . Q . Did she send you out upon any Occasion ? Thomson . Yes , my Lord . She sent me out for a pair of Gloves . When I came in again I miss 'd all the Plate . Q . ( to the Prisoner ) Would you ask this Witness any Questions ? Prisoner . That Woman that owns the Plate , wanted me to come to live with her . She keeps a Bawdy-House . For this Plate or any Thing that I had , she said she would make her Man pay . She had got 20,000 l. Please you my Lord , she has hang 'd twenty . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 128. John Peter Mayaffree stands indicted , for that he , on the 20th Day of December , was possessed of a certain Lottery Ticket , that before that Time had been made in Vertue of several Acts of Parliament , & c. He stands indicted a second Time , for uttering and vending , with an Intent to defraud Persons unknown , & c. Council for the Crown . Gentlemen , The Prisoner at the Bar has pleaded that he is not Guilty : We , who are concern 'd for his Majesty , shall call our Witnesses ; and if we prove to your Satisfaction , you 'll please to find him Guilty . Another Council . I am Council of the same Side on the Behalf of the Crown , against the Prisoner . The Offence , you observe , he stands now indicted for , has been in some Measure open 'd by the Gentleman before me . Gentlemen , I believe it is pretty well known to you , that great Part of the Property of the Subjects of this Kingdom is in Government Paper-Securities . In order to secure that Property to the Subject , it is but necessary the severest Penalties should be inflicted upon those that should venture to alter those Securities . With Regard to this present Indictment it is laid different Ways . There are Charges upon the Prisoner at the Bar , that he in Fact did forge and alter this . It is likewise laid , that he did vend and sell the Ticket so alter 'd and forg 'd , as there are various Accounts in the Indictment . If we shall either shew to you that the Prisoner himself actually forg 'd , or which is the same Thing , the same in its Consequences , he sold this Lottery Ticket knowing it to be counterfeit , the Offence will be the same . To prove that he actually forg 'd this himself , it may be a difficult Matter , or to produce any Person that was present when he did . Gentlemen , you 'll consider , that Forgeries are Works of a very dark Nature ; but really the Evidence we shall lay before you , will amount , in my humble Apprehension , to a demonstrative Proof , that the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person who was actually guilty of altering this Ticket himself . Tho ' supposing it does not come up to that , our Evidences will shew , that he did actually sell this Ticket so alter 'd , knowing it to be so forg 'd . Gentlemen , I think in order to find the Prisoner Guilty , there will be three Things to prove to you : First , That this was a forg 'd , alter 'd , counterfeit Ticket . This is the first Fact I shall lay before you . The next Thing , in order to bring it home to the Prisoner at the Bar , will be to shew you , that this Ticket so altered , counterfeited and forged , was sold by him to a Person at Hazard 's Lottery-Office . The Third , that he knew it to be counterfeited and alter 'd ; or , which will amount to the same Thing , that he actually forg 'd it himself . Gentlemen , I believe I shall be able to prove all these Things to you strictly and demonstratively . Gentlemen , the Method in which I propose to lay this Evidence before you , will be in the first Place to shew you , that the Ticket is in Fact an alter 'd , counterfeit , not a true Ticket . In order to shew that , it may be necessary to observe to you the Manner of making out these Lottery Tickets . 'T is directed , that there shall be a Book made , and that in that Book there shall be three Columns . I shall first mention to you the Columns , then the Reason . The Act of Parliament directs , that the Book shall be divided into three Columns , the middle Column is to be the Ticket , which is to be sold and dispos 'd off to the Proprietor of the Lottery . The outside is to be given to the Adventurer . The Ticket next to that goes into the Wheel , but between them there are Flourishes , and those Flourishes must exactly agree . Further , at the End of the other Ticket there is another Flourish , which , when the Party comes to the Government to receive the Prize , supposing it to be a Prize , 't is check 'd with a Flourish remaining upon the Back ; and if it does not agree with it , 't is clear 't is a Forgery . I do n't think the Wisdom of Man could have invented a greater Method of certain Security , than having these particular Flourishes , so divided by a Pair of Scissars . Then , Gentlemen , let us consider , whether this Ticket deserves the Name of a true genuine Ticket ; or , whether it deserves the Name of a counterfeit or forged Ticket . Upon the Face of the Ticket itself , we shall produce the Purport to be of Number 19165 ; that Purport is upon the Face of it . But Gentlemen , we shall shew to you these Tickets , as sign 'd by Mr. Hans , who is the proper Officer for signing Tickets . We shall shew you this Number 105 is not the Ticket it was at the Time it was made out , but it has been alter 'd and counterfeited ; and the Method is this ; that it is not the Number 19105 , but that it was a Ticket number 'd 19165 , so the Alteration that had been made in this Ticket , is by taking off the Top of the 6 , the Bottom of the 6 remaining as a 0 , which will reduce the Number to 19105 . To shew you this has been so , we have a Book from the Office here , and by comparing this Ticket with the Book of the Office , from which it was cut , do exactly tally ; the Flourish on this Ticket and the Flourish in the Lottery-Office Book do exactly tally with Number 19165 . This proves that this Ticket must have borne Number 19165 . To go further , that this could not be the original Ticket , the real Number of which was 19165 ; because comparing it with the Check of that Number , it entirely disagrees with it . This will plainly shew to you that this Ticket we now produce to you , is not the Ticket first deliver 'd out . Gentlemen , there is likewise another Thing pretty plain here , that this could not be the original Ticket , because the Number 19105 , it seems , the real Ticket , bearing Date 19105 , has come to the Office to be claim 'd , and that Ticket does exactly tally with its proper Number . The second Part will be more particular to your Consideration , which relates to the Prisoner at the Bar , that is , to bring home to him . The second Point will be to shew that the Prisoner at the Bar sold this very Ticket , now purporting to bear the Number 19 , 105 , and which will prove to you , that he sold the Ticket for 20 l. and it may not be improper to suggest to you the Reason the Person may have to alter the Number ; 19 , 165 was drawn a Blank , the Number 19 , 105 was drawn a Prize , 20 l. If a Man by his Ingenuity , instead of being the Proprietor of a Blank , he was then entitled to a Prize of 20 l. We shall prove that the Prisoner brought this Ticket to Hazard 's Lottery-Office as a Prize of 20 l. But , Gentlemen , there is a Step further we must go , and that is , to induce you to be of Opinion , that the Prisoner at the Bar , when he sold this Ticket , knew it not to be a real genuine Ticket ; but that he either alter 'd it himself with his own Hand , or he knew it to be alter 'd by some other Person ; and , Gentlemen , in Things of this Kind , as I mention 'd before it , it is impossible to call any Person who was by at the Time of his forging of it . Would he call any Witness to see him perform it ; nor after he had done it , would be in Prudence acquaint any Person that he had done it ? Then how is it Persons are ever prov 'd guilty of Facts of this Kind , but from Circumstances , if they are strong , clear and plain ; such will convince you that he did know ? These are the Things that will be most proper for your Consideration ; and , Gentlemen , we think we shall be able to do it . I would begin first with laying down one Fact . which shews , in my Opinion , the Wickedness of the Intention of the Prisoner at the Bar ; that was this : This Ticket he bought at Wilson 's Lottery-Office ; when he came there , he enquir 'd for some Lottery Tickets to buy , and enquir 'd for Numbers where there were either 6 or 9 in these Numbers : The People with regard to Chances might be superstitious ; a plansible Reason he gives why he desir 'd Numbers of 6 and 9 , was that they were fortunate and lucky Numbers : Gentlemen , I am afraid it will be the Reverse to himself . Gentlemen , if you consider it , it is an easy Thing to take off 6 and make it an o . Thus the 6 and 9 , by the Alteration of one of these Numbers , you have twenty-three Chances to one but it comes up a Prize ; if you have the Number wherein there is a 6 and 9 , keep it , see whether it comes up a Prize or not : If it comes up a Blank , if I will own this Number , in five Numbers suppose 6 and 9 to be among them , according to my Instruction you may have twenty-three Chances , in order to have a Chance of that 's coming up a Prize ; therefore he shews cum animo , that he applied at Wilson 's Office to have a Ticket with a 6 and 9 . As Matters of this Nature depend on Circumstances , we must lay all before you , and you must connect them all together . And after some Time that he had bought this Ticket , and it came up a Blank , he went and sold it for a Prize at Mr . Hazard 's Lottery-Office . I believe it may be known to you to be pretty usual , when a Ticket is sold for a Prize , that the Owner of the Ticket , or the Person that sells the Ticket , is requir 'd to indorse his Name on the Back of the Ticket ; accordingly the Prisoner at the Bar was directed so to do when he sold this for a Prize of 20 l. Gentlemen , did he put his Name on the Back of it ? No . What was the Name ? John Wilson , jun . How came he with his own Hand to write John Wilson , jun . when his Name was Peter Mayaffree , not Wilson ? Would a Man , who intended to act fairly , go not to put his true Name , Peter Mayaffree , and put one John Wilson , jun. ? That to me is an extreme strong Circumstance , that at that Time he was doing what he knew he ought not to do : He must know it was hazardous , dangerous to put his own Name : Had it been not a real good Ticket , he had been conscious to himself , he had been ashamed and afraid to put his own Name on the Back of it . The unhappy Person at the Bar did do so ; instead of putting his own Name , he put John Wilson , jun . If we make this to be Fact , with this Circumstance alone , which I did not think to do , there is another Circumstance , that at the Time he was charg 'd with this Offence , that he himself own 'd and acknowledged it . But , Gentlemen , you 'll excuse me , however , from not relying singly on that Circumstance of his acknowledging alone ; though , to be sure , it is the strongest Evidence in the World ; but to strengthen and corroborate that , we , on the Part of the Crown , think it our Duly to lay before you all the Circumstances . These are the Circumstances we must mention ; we do n't doubt , when we have laid these before you , but you will think this Ticket before you is forged and alter 'd . Gentlemen , the bare selling a Ticket which has been alter 'd , is of itself a pretty strong Suspicion upon the Party , at least it throws him upon this Proof . Any Man , indeed , may go into Change-Alley and buy a Ticket alter 'd by another Person : But if one does do it , and goes to sell that again , it throws the Proof upon the Party to shew how he came by it . We can shew how this Gentleman came by this Ticket ; that it was sold to him at Hazard 's Lottery Office . That 19 , 105 at Wilson 's Lottery Office . As to 19 , 105 , that was never sold at that Office . So far the Council for the Crown . Council for the Prisoner . ] Q . ( to Mr . Hand . ) I think you are one of the Receivers , and appointed to sign the Lottery Tickets . Pray , Sir , look upon that Ticket ; Did you sign that Ticket ? Is that your Hand-writing ? Did you cut that Ticket out of the Book ? Hand . No , I did not cut it , but I sign 'd it . Council , to Mr. Hand . Where did you receive that Parchment ? Hand . I receiv 'd it from the Bank ; this was sign 'd by the Lords of the Treasury . Council , to Mr. Hand . When was it you wrote . Hand . The printed Part was all the same . Q . Was it separate , or in the Book ? Hand . But five of them in a Leaf . Q . When you wrote it , it was then in a Book ? Hand . Yes . Q . Did you examine the Number , and write the Name so particularly ? Can you venture to swear that the Time you wrote your Name it bore the Number 19 , 165 ? Hand . No , I do not particularly remember it . Q . Well , I suppose you wrote them cursorily as they fall ? Hand . Yes , Sir . Q . Who is the Book deliver 'd to , to sign ? Hand . We take , perhaps , 10,000 at a Time . Q . Is it not possible , in transcribing so many Numbers , that aMan may make aCypher , and forget to put a Top to it ? Council for the Crown . Brother , I do n't think that is a proper Question to be ask 'd . Court . Mr. Hand has prov 'd that this was an undrawn Ticket of the last Lottery deliver 'd out . To Mr. Jones , Secretary to the Managers of the Lottery . Produce the Book out of which it was cut . Are you sworn ? What is that you have in your Hand ? Jones . The Book that contains 100 Tickets for the Lottery . Council . Be so good as to put this Number to 19 , 105 , and tell me how it tallies . Does it tally with the Check or not ? Jones . It does not . Council . Now turn it to 19165 , tell me how it tallies with that . Jones . It tallies with 19165 . Q . Are you concern 'd in the Lottery ? I desire to know what is your Opinion , whence that Ticket was cut : Was it cut from 19165 ? Jones . Yes . Because the Check agrees to it exactly . Q . ( by the Council ) I think you told me the Ticket was cut off from 19165 . It represents 19105 Do you think it has been alter 'd ? Jones . Yes . In taking off the Top of the 6 and altering it to 0. Q . ( by the Court ) Are the Numbers printed or written ? Jones . They are written . Council . I think we have sufficiently prov 'd that this is a forg 'd Ticket . Q . ( to John Disel ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Disel . Yes . Q . Did you buy the Lottery Ticket of him ? Disel . Yes . Q . Are you the Servant of Mr . Hazard , are you not liable to make good any Deficiencies of Contract ? Disel . No , Sir , I am not . Q . Have you the Ticket in your Hand ? Disel . Yes Sir . Q. Pray did you buy the Ticket of the Prisoner at the Bar ? Did you buy it in the Condition it is now ? Pray what might you give for it ? Disel . I gave 15 l. Q . Did he inform you that the Ticket was drawn a Prize ? Did you buy it as such ? Disel . yes . It prov 'd to be such by the Commissioners Prize-Papers . Q . And finding that Number to be drawn a Prize of 20 l. you gave him 15 l. for it . Disel . Yes . Q. Pray Sir , did you require that he should endorse that Ticket ? Disel . If they are Prizes , we always do it . If they are Blanks we do n't insist upon it . Q . And the Prisoner at the Bar did endorse the Ticket . What Name is that endors 'd by ? Disel . John Wilson , Jun . Council for the Prisoner . Are you sure it was he , look at him ; did you ask him what his Name was ? Disel . No , not them , I did not . Q . You only ask 'd him to sign it . Did you ask where he liv 'd ? Disel , No Sir , I have since , but not before . Court . There is 20 l. wroce in the Front . Disel . That was wrote when I bought it . Q . You took it for a real , unalter 'd Ticket . Disel . I paid 15 l. for it . Q . Did you know this young Man before ? Disel . Sir , I have seen his Face before . He came to ask the Price of Blanks and Prizes . Q . When was the first Time you saw him after ? Disel . I did not see him after , 'till I took him the 12th of January . Q . You took him , did you : What did you say to him ? Disel . I took him skaiting on the Canal . Pull 'd off my Hat to him , and said , I knew him ; I ask 'd him whether he did not remember selling a Ticket , a 20 l. Prize , I ask 'd him his Name . He told me his Name was Wilson . Council for the Crown . Did he tell you where he bought the Ticket ? Disel . He said , at Wilson 's Office . Q . Did you say any Thing to him at that Time about altering of it ? Disel . I did say to him , I believ 'd it had been alter 'd . Q . ( to John Branch ) You belong to Mr. Wilson ? Branch . Yes . Q . Do you know of the Prisoner 's coming to Mr. Wilson 's to buy any Tickets ? Branch . I ca n't be positive as to the Time . Q . Did he come to purchase any Tickets before the Drawing ? Did he , when he came to your House , purchase any Tickets ? Branch . He purchas 'd eight Tickets . Q. I desire to know of you , whether the Number 19,165 was the Number sold at your Office ? Branch . Yes . Q. Pray , Sir , when that Number 19,165 was sold at your Office , did it purport upon the Face of it to bear that Number ? Was 19,105 ever sold at your Office ? Are you sure that the Ticket 19,165 was sold at your Office ? And the Time it was sold did it purport to bear that Number ? Have you seen the Prisoner at the Bar any Time before now ? Branch . I have seen him at our Office , I believe , twice , and never saw him after , 'till I saw him at the Constable 's House . Q . ( for the Crown ) You are positive that 19,165 was sold at your Office , and I think you are as positive that the Number 19,105 was not sold at your Office ? Branch . Yes . George Bret . I know this to be the Ticket I took out of the Office , which I suspected to be counterfeit , being cut away at the Top . Q . ( to Bret ) Look upon the Prisoner . Was you by the Prisoner at the Time he was apprehended ? What Name did he answer to ? Bret . I ask 'd my Servant , whether that was the Gentleman of whom he bought the Ticket ? And I ask 'd the Prisoner , whether his Name was John Wilson , jun . He said it was . After he came to our Office , I fetch 'd the Ticket down Stairs to him , ask 'd him , whether this was the Ticket he sold to my Servant ? I ask 'd him , whether it was his writing ? He said it was his Hand-Writing and Name . Q . ( to Francis Jackman ) Do you live at Hazard 's Lottery-Office ? Jackman . I live at Charing-cross . Q . Was you by at the Time the Prisoner was apprehended ? Jackman . Yes Sir ; but was not near enough to see his Face . Q . Now , I desire to know what Name he would have gone by at that Time ? Jackman . Mr. Bret fetch 'd down the Ticket , and shew 'd him the Writing , and he acknowledgld it was his own Hand-Writing . Q . ( to John Lambert , Constable ) Was you by at the Time the Prisoner was apprehended ? Lambert . I was charg 'd by Mr. Bret . Q. Pray , who belongs to that Office at Charing-cross ? Bret . Mr . Hazard and I , and one Mr. Baraway . Q . ( to the Constable ) What was you charg 'd with the Prisoner for ? Constable . I was charg 'd with him for counterfeiting a Lottery-Ticket . The Time he was in my Custody , he own 'd that that was his Hand-Writing . That was all that I heard him say . Council for the Prisoner . If your Lordship will favour me upon this Act of Parliament in Point of Law - Now my Brother says that he has done - And if he has done , I apprehend clearly upon the Construction of this Act of Parliament , that your Lordship must direct the Prisoner to be immediately acquitted . This Indictment consists of eight several Accounts . Notwithstanding the fair Admonition they had to put it in a proper Way , if they could have done it , they have , with great Submission to the Court , in Point of Law , fail 'd . My Lord , it is a new Prosecution , and founded upon a new Act of Parliament . Nor would I be understood by any Thing that may drop from me , in the least to encourage or cotennances the smallest Attempt to impose upon the Publick . My Brother will own , that I did desire last Sessions that this young Gentleman might be continued , on the Account of their failing in their Indictment then . I apprehend the same Objection still remains that was then debated , to be essentially necessary to the contributing to this Crime , which seems now to be defective , both upon the Face of the Indictment , and Appearance of the Evidence , that stands upon it . In the first Place , upon the Face of the Indictment , it was clearly determin 'd by the Court , and upon the b est Reasons , that they fail 'd for want of laying it in the Indictment . That this must be to defraud some Person or another ; because any person living might take it and cut it to Pieces , and make what Alteration in it he pleased , provided he did it without an Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever ; and this very Statute and very Clause , that authorises this Prosecution , seems to vindicate this Thing , and quote a proper Method for a Determination of it . First , whether this is a real or proper Ticket or not . I must confess that the Evidence that is given , never desires to carry it any further than the Law will bear . Here has been a Ticket that does not tally with these Books . My Brother talk 'd of producing the real and true , that purports the Number , which this is alter 'd to , which was actually , and bona side , entitled to this Prize . If it did come up a Prize . He says he had it ; he should have produced it . Now if he had the Ticket , and do not produce it , tho ' he suggests there is such a Ticket , as that , they are bound on their Oaths not to believe it ; whatsoever Alteration there is in this Ticket produced in Point of Law , whether by Design or Accident must be reckon 'd a real Ticket , unless they could have prov 'd that any Person did actually alter it . And it seems to be calculated , upon reading this whole Clause , that the Legislature has determin 'd , before there shall be a criminal Prosecution , that there shall be a thorough Examination into the Matter ; therefore , your Lordship will please to observe , how the Statute has determin 'd this Thing . Here is a Dispute between the Number of two Tickets . If this Ticket has been alter 'd from 19165 to 19105 , the Contest must arise , who is entitled to the Prize of the real Number , or the Owner and Proprietor of this alter 'd Ticket , that imports at present to bear this Number ; therefore , they should have gone to the Commissioners and Managers to adjust this , before the Prosecution could have been set on Foot [ some Clanses in the Act of Parliament were read ] . Next Place it says , if any Dispute should arise - Here is a Contention and a Dispute ; the Contention is , whether this Number now importing 19105 , which they say is alter 'd ; or whether the Ticket 19165 is the real Benefit Ticket . This must invariably be , I apprehend in Point of Reason and Point of Law , between the Proprietor of the real Ticket and the Owner of this Ticket . To Mr. Veaw . What do you know of the Prisoner ? Veaw . He was in our Compting-House ever since he was eight Years old . He behav 'd honourably and well . Q . Who has he liv 'd with here in England ? Veaw . A Jeweller in Tavistock-Street . I never heard but he behav 'd in every thing well : That is the Character he has had all along ; and he was entrusted with Jewels ? Q . Do you know of your own Knowledge that he has been entrusted with Jewels ? Veaw . He has been at my Compting-House , sent by his Uncle ; and I know he has always done well . Q. Pray , Sir , how old may he be ? Veaw . About seventeen Years . Q . When in Holland he was put into the Compting-House , at eight or nine Years of Age ? When he came into England he was about eleven Years of Age ? You remember him in the Compting-House in Holland ? Veaw . Yes , in my own Compting-House . Q . How long was he in your Compting-House ? Veaw . He was there above half a Year . Q . Now give me Leave to ask you , how you came over to England ? Veaw . I have liv 'd in England almost nine Years , backwards and Forwards . Q . Was it before you came over the first Time , or afterwards ? Veaw . Afterwards , when I went over again . Q . You say in your Compting-House : Was he there entrusted with large Sums of Money ? Do you commonly trust Boys with large Sums of Money ? Veaw . What large Sums they can pay in Silver . Q . ( to Mayaffree ) How long has this young Man liv 'd with you ? Mayaffree . Six Years . Q . In what Manner has he behav 'd ? Mayaffree . Very well . I have entrusted him several Times with 2 or 3000 l. value . Q . Has he had the Command of Money , upon your Oath , has he not defrauded or cheated you ? Mayaffree . Not of one Farthing . A very honest sober Person , every Body lov 'd him . Q . ( to William Joslin ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Joslin . Three or four Years . He always had a good Character , Sometimes he has brought Jewels to our House from his Uncle , of a considerable Value . I have always heard a fair Character of him . I was never more surpris 'd than to hear of of this Indictment laid against him . Q . ( to - Parquot ) How long have you known the Prisoner ? Parquot . I have known him a great While . I know him to be an honest , sober Lad . Q . Do you think that he is a Man that would be guilty of such a Crime as this ? Parquot . I was astonish 'd when I heard such a Thing of him . Several other reputable Persons appear 'd in Behalf of the Prisoner , and gave him a good Character . Guilty Death . His Lordship in the Conclusion of his Charge , to the Jury , desir 'd them to take into some Consideration , the Character , which gives some Weight in Cases of a doubtful Nature . The Jury on Account of his excellent Character and tender Years , recommended him to his Majesty 's Mercy . Taken at Carlisle , committed for High Treason , and order 'd to remain .
