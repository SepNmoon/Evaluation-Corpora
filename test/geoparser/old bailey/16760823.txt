A Narrative of the Proceedings at the Sessions , Aug. 24 . 1676 . FOr the satisfaction of the world , and warning of Persons vitiously enclined with variety of Examples , wherein ill Courses justly are punisht with lamentable Ends , we have thought fit to continue this Narrative : The present Sessions being no less remarkable than any that have preceded it ; but rather pregnant with more notorious Rogueries : And because from the Female Sex sprung all our Woes and bad Inclinations at first , we may begin with The Trial of three very young Women , who were grown so couragious in Villany , as to break open a house at Islington : one of them had a Mother liv 'd there , and carried two of her Gronies thither , and about 12 a Clock at Night , they attempted with a Picklock to open this Neighbours Door ; but not being able to effect it , she that was acquainted run to her Mothers and got a Key , and with that wrinch 'd out some Nails , and took down a Casement , and so got in , whilst one stood ready at the Window to receive the Booty , and the other was very advantageously posted in the Street , to give notice to the Attacquers , if any Alarm hapned . They stole a considerable quantity of Linnen and Cloaths , and had done more mischief , had theynot been frighted with a noise , as if somebody were stirring in the Chamber ; however they got away safe , but with such unlucky haste , that they left the Key in the Room , which the Woman of the house next Morning finding , and knowing it to be her Neighbours , whose Daughter was noted to be of an ill repute , she seized them upon suspicion ; and they in effect confessed the Fact before the Justice : but the Jury found only two Guilty , so that their Scout was acquitted . The next was a Fellow for stealing a Bed , Rug , Blankets , Curtains , & c. Two of them came to a publique house in Barnet to lodge , in the night having made up the whole furniture of the Bed into Bundles , with the Cords tied to the Window , one of them got down into a Back-yard ; the other flung out the things and followed ; after they had marched two or three Miles towards London , but out of the Road and a little before Sun rising , a Countrey-man going to work observed and suspected them , and with his Fellow Labourer having dogg 'd them a pretty way , assoon as they perceived it , they flung down their Bundles , and prepared to fight , without any provocation , or one word said to them : whereupon the Countryman knockt one of them down with a Pease hook , who was now tryed and found Guilty ; the other fled , but left all the Baggage on the place . Two young Fellows were arraigned for a Burglary at Enfield , that had got their Pillage in two Sacks upon their horses , and crossing the Country , were seen to ride through Holloway by one that knew them to be notorious Thieves ; who suspecting by the time , being not yetSun-rising , and their Bundles , that they had made that sally to force Contribution from some of their Neighbours , or in plain English , had been breaking open some house , got a horse , and some company pursuing them , took them at Islington . They pretended they found the Goods in the street neer Coney ; but the owner swearing himself robb 'd that very night , and that these were his Goods taken out of his house , they were both found guilty of Burglary . A poor Scotch-Seaman was tried for speaking some most wicked and detestable words of our Soveraign Lord the King ; and that he the said Prisoner Did not care if the whole Nation were damn 'd and destroyed . The words were fully proved by a Gentlemen of Quality , to whom they were spoken , and by two others present ; but it also appearing that at the time of speaking the Prisoner was extraordinary drunk , for he had just before been taken up like one dead in the streets neer Billinsgate by some that knew him , and laid in a Boat to carry him to Gravesend , he belonging to a ship outward bound for Guinny : and these Gentlemen coming into the same Boat , and , it seems , disturbing him before he was well awake , or had recovered his senses , by asking him whether his Majesty 's Barge were gone by , he , in that insensible condition , uttered the words ; wherefore because both the next day and now at the Bar , he declared his sorrow for , and abhorrence of such wicked Expressions , and shewed how he had for divers years , according to his capacity , faithfully served his Majesty , and with tears implored the favour of the Bench , though the Jury could not but bring him in guilty of speaking the words , yet the Court were pleased onely to Fine him . And certainly this one Example might warn and deter all reasonable persons from this odious sin of Drunkenness , which makes men act and say things they never imagined , & frequently brings their lives into such imminent danger , as in this Case , wherein nothing but extraordinary mercy could save the unhappy Criminal . A Gentleman was indicted for a Highway-man , and the person who pretended himself robb 'd , swore it very positively , That the Prisoner and three more such a day on a Common beyond Brandford , took from him twenty four shillings ; but the Prosecutor having never leavied any Hue and Cry , nor declared such his being robb 'd for above a twelvemonth , till the Prisoner afterwards being made a special Baliff , did arrest him for a just Debt due to the said Prisoner 's Mother ; at which time , as appeared by several credible persons , the Prosecutor declared he knew not , nor had ever seen the Prisoner in his life : And when he then made it appear by circumstances that there had been dealings between them about twelve years before , the Prosecutor then replied , If you are Mr. C. you are strangely altered ; I have not seen you many years ; and yet five weeks after he seizes the Prisoner , and charges him with robbing him , as aforesaid , in November was twelvemonths , but failed before the Justice in assigning the day , sometimes saying it was on a Saturday , and sometimes on a Tuesday : All which being extraordinary symptoms of Malice , and the Prisoner being a person of known Reputation , the Jury brought him in not guilty ; who thereupon prayed a Copy of his Indictment , which the Court readily granted ; and no doubt of it , but he will teach the Prosecutor to be more wary of charging people with Felony , by a sweeping action brought against him . A woman was indicted for a Burglary and stealing several Goods ; but to this Indictment she would in no wise plead : She was indicted for another Felony in stealing Clothes at an Ale-house , but for that she was found not guilty ; but another woman arraigned with her , convicted , and burnt in the hand for it . However the said woman standing obstinately mute to her first Indictment , notwithstanding all the perswasions of Master Sheriff , and the Ordinary representing to her that she drew her blood upon her own head , the Court was forced to that terrible Judgment , that she should be pressed to death ; and accordingly she was carried forthwith to Newgate in order to such Execution . A young man was tried for stealing a very considerable parcel of wearing Apparel : He and another came together to drink in an Ale-house with a Bundle containing the things now in question , which some persons there taking notice of , and that they look 'd very suspiciously , going about to apprehend them , one of them got away , the other was now convicted and burnt in the hand . But of all the Examples of improved youthful impudence , we must admire that of one John Evans , a Lad seeming not to be above Fifteen or Sixteen years of age at most : he has been three times in the Colledge of Newgate , once already burnt in the hand , and now charged with several Indictments , particularly for robbing a house in St. Martins-lane , and stealing a great quantity of very rich wearing Apparel : He was taken going to dispose of part of it , by the Beadle of Covent-garden , who knew him well enough to suspect him : he had several pieces of Gold about him , when apprehended ; and amongst divers other things , a silver and gold Bowl , and a Crucifix of Gold . After he was convicted the Courtwas very importunate with him to declare to whom those things belonged , or where he had them , but could get no other answer , but he found them , & c. A young Wench was likewise convicted for a Felony for stealing four pounds . She going to visit one of her associate Rogues , a Prisoner in Bridewel , made shift to steal a silver Cup , which was taken with her . She had been often concerned in such things , and burnt in the hand before , but would take no warning , and therefore was now condemned to die . Two persons were accused for Robbing a Gentleman on the Road coming from Oxford ; but he being not very confident or positive in his testimony , and the parties making it appear where they were at the same time , they were brought in not guilty . There were in all seventeen persons condemned to die , twelve men and four women to be hang 'd , and one woman to be press 'd to death ; six burnt in the hand ; four allow 'd the favour of Transportation ; for petty Larceny there were five women and three men ordered to be Whipt .
