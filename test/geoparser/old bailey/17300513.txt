Then being bid to give an Account ; he depos 'd , That he thinks about two Months ago , the Prisoner bid him go up Stairs to move some Chairs out of a Room into a Closet , that he did so , and as he was coming down , he met him , and bid him go up into his Room , and ask 'd for a Cane , and bid him down with his Breeches , and felt all over his naked Body ; and also took him up Stairs , and bid him take down his Breeches , and he strok 'd all over his naked Body , and he went down into the Kitchen , and he bid him go up into the Garret , and look for a Marble cover 'd Pocket-Book , telling him he would give him a half penny if he found it , and came up to him , and ask 'd him ( this Evidence ) what he ow 'd him ? That he answer 'd , he did not know what he meant , and then he ( the Prisoner ) went and sate down in a Chair , pull 'd down his Breeches , put a Handkerchief before my Face , and said , he wonder 'd whether I could see any thing when the Doors , & c. were shut , bid me pull down my Breeches , and then put his Privy member between my Thighs , - [ the Evidence went on and fully prov 'd the Fact . ] He ( this Evidence ) added , that he had heard other Boys ( his School fellows ) say , that he had done the like to them , and being ask 'd who they were ? He said , Rue Lewis , John Wright , John Meer , Eward Lewis . William Ham Senior depos 'd , That he using frequently to examin his Son at Night , what he had done in the Day , the Boy said he did not like his Master ; but he told him that he supposed he had not minded his Business , and so his Master had beaten him , and that was the occasion of it ; but he deny 'd that to be the Reason ; and his Wife examin 'd him , and he told her , and she gave him ( this Evidence ) an Account of it , upon this he went to one who had the the Direction of the School , and acquainted him with it , and he said he was sorry , that it was a shameful thing if it was so , and that he was concern 'd such a dark dismal Scene should come upon the Company 's School . Edward Caley dep 'd , That he was 10 Years of Age the 6th of August last , and being examin 'd if he knew the Nature of an Oath ? And what he was to expect if he did not speak Truth when he took an Oath ? Answered , that he should be in danger of Hell-Fire ; and answering to several Enquiries of the like Nature to the Satisfaction of the Court , was admitted to be sworn , and depos 'd as follows : He sent me up to look for his Buttons , ( he thinks ) about a Month ago , about 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon , and immediately follow 'd me up and lock 'd me into the Room , and took a bit of a Rod , and bid me down with my Breeches , and felt all about my Body , and gave me a gentle Stroke or two , and bid me not cry out , he would not hurt me ; [ This Evidence proceeded and very fully proved the Fact upon the Prisoner as the former had done ; ] and being ask 'd if he told any Body how his Master had us 'd him ? He reply 'd , he told his Bedfellow . William Allen depos 'd ; That he lay with Edward Caley , and ( he thinks ) about a Month ago , he being in Bed with him , took notice that he was very uneasy , turn 'd first upon one side and then upon the other , and that thereupon he asked him what was the matter with him ? That at length he said he would tell him , if he would not tell his Grandfather , for then he would tell his Master , and he would beat him ; that he told him what the Prisoner had done to him , and he examining , found a Blister between his Thighs . William Toy , the Boy 's Grandfather , depos 'd , That he perceiving the Boy very uneasie , he ask 'd what was the matter with him ? But he did not tell him : That the Boy not being willing to stir , he being at other times a very active Boy , he said , he believ 'd he had been naught , and his Master had whipp 'd him , and if it were so , it was well enough , for he was very unlucky , but bid his Aunt enquire into the Matter , and being inform 'd , he examin 'd him himself , what his Master had done to him ? That the Boy reply 'd , his Master had serv 'd him as the two Men had serv 'd one another that stood in the Pillory , and said also , that he has serv 'd other Boys so , as well as him , and thereupon going to enquire , he found it as he had told him . Mr. Justice Jones depos 'd , That when the Prisoner was brought before him , and charg 'd with these Facts , he interrogated him , for what Reason he had us 'd the Boys thus ? That he answer 'd , he did it to improve him in his Studies , and did not deny , or make any other Excuse . The Prisoners Council upon this Evidence remark 'd , That indeed the Offence the Prisoner was charg 'd with , was a very heinous one , and therefore ought to have the strongest Proof to make it out . That it was very extraordinary , that he should make such an Attempt without so much as a Caution ( which he had not heard mentioned by any of the Evidence ) given , not to mention it . That nothing had been produc 'd to prove , that the Prisoner had before any such Inclination , as what he was now charg 'd with . That the Desendant being chosen Master of the Free-School of the Coopers Company , against the Vote and Will of one of the Principal Electors , his Resentment of his coming in contrary to his Interest , had been the occasion of setting on foot this Prosecution . That the Prisoner was a Person of a fair and honest Character ; and to this , call 'd the following Evidence . The Reverend Mr. Isaac Sharp depos 'd , That he had known the Prisoner more than 20 Years , and he always had a fair Character for a Pious and Religious young Man ; that he had known him intimately well , and had never heard any thing of this kind of him before , nor had ever heard any ill of him till this time , and he did believe that all Trinity College would give him a good Character . Josiah Ridgwell depos 'd , That he had lain with the Prisoner , and he never had offer 'd any thing immodest to him , nor had ever heard of any immodesty acted by him . John Johnson depos 'd , That he had known the Prisoner 2 or 3 Years , and his Character was very good for Piety and Regularity of Life ; that he had had Conversation with him , and lain with him , and he had never made any Attempt upon him , nor had he ever heard an immodest Word from him . Mr. Martin depos 'd , That he had known him 12 Years , and had never heard any Body speak ill of him . Here his Council remark 'd , That the tender Age of the Witnesses and his Character being justly weigh 'd , the latter might be thought to counterpoise the former . Upon this , the Council for the Prosecutors call 'd the following additional Evidences . Henry Hennoker depos 'd , That he was in the 11th Year of his Age , and being examin 'd as to what Sense he had of the Nature of an Oath , gave so Satisfactory an Account to the Court , that he was permitted to be sworn , and depos 'd , That about a Month since , the Prisoner sent him up to look after a Carpenter who was at work in the House , to ask him if he had done work , that he came down and told him that he had not done , and after that he bid him go up again , and he came up after him , and pull 'd down his Breeches , and stroaked all about his Body . Edward Allen depos 'd , That the Prisoner bid him go up and see for a String , that he went down and told him that there was no String , that he said there was , and came up himself and bid him go into the Chamber , and being there , he ask 'd him ( this Evidence ) what he ow 'd him ? He reply 'd he could not tell what he meant , that then he took a Sprig of a Rod , and laid him over his Knee and whipp 'd him a little : That another time he bid him down with his Breeches , but he ran away and the Prisoner caught him , that he got away again , and his Coat gave way , and he ran down into the School . The Prisoner deny 'd the Facts , inveigh 'd against the Parents of the Boys , who had been Evidences against him ; said , they were Persons of so vile a Character , that their good Word was a Scandal , and that the Prosecution was malicious , being carried on by his Enemies who had voted for Mr . Veer , the present Master of the School , now in his Place , and called the following Evidences . The Prisoner 's Sister depos 'd , That upon hearing the Charge laid upon her Brother , she went without any Knowledge of the Prisoner to Mrs Ham , the Mother of the first Evidence , and ask 'd her what was the Ground of the Clamour rais 'd against him ? And she answer 'd her she could not tell ; that she ask 'd for the Child , and when he came , she ask 'd him what his Master had done to him ? That he answered nothing . That she said to Mrs. Ham , is it fit a Man should loose his Reputation for nothing ? That she made answer , that Mrs. Allen would tear the House down about our Ears if we do n't be Evidences ; that she desir 'd a Surgeon might be sent for , to examine the Child , and did name Mr. Martin ; that she reply 'd , God forbid , for her Child had got no harm . Mr. Day depos 'd , That he had known the Prisoner for some Years , and he used to come to his Master 's House , and lie with him , and he never saw any thing but what was handsome by him . Thomas Veer being ask 'd by the Prisoner 's Council , Whether he did not know that Mr. - or any other Person , had not threatned to send any of the Persons to Newgate that should not appear against the Defendant ? He reply 'd , he did not . After a full hearing of the Evidences on both Sides , the Jury found the Prisoner guilty of both Indictments . [ Pillory . See summary . ] [ Imprisonment .
