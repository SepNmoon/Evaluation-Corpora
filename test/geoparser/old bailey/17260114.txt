I had been acquainted with Mary Watkins a pretty while , and knew that when her Mother died , she left her a great deal of good Brass and Pewter ; and when she came to me with these Plates , she told me that they were her own , and that she was obliged to sell them , because she was in Lection of having her other Goods seiz 'd for Rent . And as for John Howard he promis 'd to be very good , and leave of his old Trade ; and therefore my Husband desir 'd Mary Watkins to let him be in her Cellar , till he could get a Ship to send him to Sea out of harms Way . The Prisoners in their Defence said that they had been a merry Making , and coming away about 2 in the Morning , they met Jack Howard with a Bag , and something in it ; that he asked them to go with him to his Lodgings , and they consented , it being rather too late to go to their own .

After which he demanded the Key of the Iron Chest , but she told him she had not got it . He then swore she must fetch him 20 Guineas , or he 'd shoot her immediately . She arose extreamly terrify 'd , and was going up Stairs for the Money , but he told her she must swear again before she went . She kist the Book a second Time , and then he let her go . She was met upon the Stairs by her Maid , Ann Loyd , who perceiving the Disorder her Mistress was in , and understanding the Cause of it ; she went with her into the Chamber , shut the Door fast , and would not let her carry down the Money . The Prisoner came to the Door . bounc 'd against it , and splitted it , but could not get it open ; then he ran down into the Yard , and the Maid looking out of the Window , he presented the Blunderbuss , and swore he 'd shoot her if she made any Noise . But yet she cry 'd out Murder , and upon that he ran away . On the second Indictment , Tho Martin the Coachman thus depos 'd . The Prisoner and I lay together , in a Room over the Stables .

However , I let him wear them 2 or 3 Days , and then he ran away with them . To this Indictment , the Prisoner said in his Defence , that Martin lent him the Breeches , and it not appearing to be a felonious taking , the Jury acquitted him of it ; but as to the first Indictment , he said he had nothing to say for himself , and if the Court thought fit to hang him , he should be very well contented .

One Tuesday Night they drank together in a Room on the same Floor with their Bed-Chamber , and in which Room stood a Chest of Drawers , wherein Cook had lockt up a Couple of Gold Rings , and kept the Keys in her Pocket . When their Liquor was out they began to undress themselves , and Cook pulling of her Pocket with the Keys in it , wrapt it up in her Apron , and left it in the Room , and so they went to Bed together .

Cook got up about 7 , and mist her Keys . Martha Clifton ( who lodged in the same House ) helpt her for to look for them , but they could not find them then , but after the Prisoner came in again , they found them in a Place where they had looked before . The Rings were mist out of the Chest of Drawers , and a Shirt of William Denny 's was found where the Prisoner had pawn 'd it ; but it appeared , that with the Prosecutors Knowledge , she took the Shirt to wash , and only forgot to bring it home again .

About One in the Afternoon , as I was coming along the Road from Shackelwell , betwixt the two Ponds , going towards , and within about 2 Stones throw of the Cock-Alehouse , the Prisoner came up to me with a Knife in his Hand , told me he must have my Money , and threatened to kill me if I made the least noise . I was going to give him my Money , but he cut the String that tied my Pockets , took 'em both from me , and ran away . I scream 'd out , and in a Minutes time ran to the Cook , and told several there of my loss , and describ 'd the Person that rob 'd me , and they pursued and took him ; here the Prisoner pray 'd the Court to ask her , if she did not say ( when he was brought to her at the Cock ) that she did not know him ? And whether the Person that rob 'd her had a Gun or not ; she answered that when he first came into that House , his Hair hung over his Face , and she did indeed say , that she was not sure that he was the Person , but that she was positive to him as soon as his Hair was put back . And that she saw no Gun that he had when he rob 'd her . William Inns thus depos 'd . As I was riding up Love-Lane , towards the Cock at Newington ; I saw the Prisoner running with a Gun in his Hand , he got over the Bank and run across the Fields . I presently got to the Cock , and hearing of the Robbery , I return 'd with several others in the Pursuit of him , he got over 2 Banks and a Stile just by his Fathers House and there I lost the fight of him . I enquir 'd of his Father and Mother if they saw such a Person , his Mother answer 'd no , but his Father said he did see such a Person go by the Door . I searched the House , and at last found him in a back Place behind a Curtain with with a Book in his Hand . I brought him down without his Hat , and he put on a Hat below . His Father said Jack , is that the Hat that you had out with you ? He answered no . His Father than bad him put the same Hat on , that the Woman might see him in the same Dress he was in before . I asked him why he run a way , and he said for fear of losing his Gun . William Baden thus depos 'd . I and some others were at the Cock when the Woman came in and complained of her loss ; she describ 'd the Person , and directed us which way he took . We immediately went out , and quickly saw the Prisoner running with a Gun in his Hand , we pursued him over 3 Fields , and he ran into his Father 's Garden . - When we had taken him , he said that he ran upon seeing us , for fear we should take away his Gun ; several others spoke to the same Effect . John Adams ( a Boy ) thus depos 'd . I was in our Field , when the Woman cry 'd out , and by the Account that she has given , I guess she was got not above 20 Yards from the place where she says she was robb 'd ; and that very time of her Screaming , the Prisoner came into our Field with a Gun , and was then about 3 or 4 hundred Yards from her , for I could see 'em both at once , and could have seen if he or any Body else had rob 'd her , but I saw no body near her . He did not run , but laid his Gun down up on the Bank , and walked backwards and forwards and look 'd up in the Trees after a Thrush , as I suppose , for I heard a Thrush sing , I call 'd him Peter Gunner , and bid him get out of my Masters field , or else I 'd set the Dog at him , and then the Men came up and he run away ; but from the time that the Woman cry 'd out , to the time that they follow 'd him , he might have got out of their Sight if he would . The Prisoner thus made his defence . I was not near the Pond when the Woman ( as she says ) was robb 'd there . My Father had order 'd me to fetch some Grains ; but seeing some Sparrows in the Garden , I took the Gun and went after 'em , but they quickly flew away , and then I spy 'd a Thrush and follow 'd it , till I came to the Field where the Boy call 'd me Peter Gunner . I saw my Father not far off , and ran home , and went in the back-way for fear he should see me , with the Gun , because if he had he would have bear me ; two or three Witnesses depos 'd , that when the Boy was brought back to the Cock , the Woman was asked if she knew him , and she said , No , the Person that robb 'd me , wore a Wig , but this Lad has his own Hair .
