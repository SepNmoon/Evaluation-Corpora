He was likewise Indicted upon the Coroner 's Inquest for the Murder aforesaid . It appeared by the Evidence , that the Prisoner and the Deceased were at the Toy at Hampton Court with about 15 other Gentlemen , on the 27th of April : That there they dined very friendly together , but towards the Evening some Words happen 'd between them . Upon which the Deceased struck the Prisoner in the Face , beat him down , and when he arose , his Lip was observ 'd to be swell 'd , and several of his Teeth out . A Drawer hearing a Noise , came up , and found the Prisoner and the Deceased against the Wainscoat of the Room , but immediately parted by the Gentlemen . After this they sat down , and seemed to be friendly again , but look 'd a little disturb 'd . This Evidence further depos 'd , that as they sat together , the Prisoner said , Sir Cholmley , you know where to find me . Upon which Sir Cholmley reply 'd , I know not where to find you ; and then the Prisoner gave him the Lie . This Witness observed the Prisoner 's Lip much swell 'd before the giving the Lie , but saw not the Blows given . It further appear 'd , that the Deceased seemed to beg the Prisoner 's Pardon at that time ; but the Prisoner told him , asking of Pardon was not Satisfaction for the Loss of his Teeth . As to the Fact : It appear 'd that the Prisoner and the Deceased were seen in Tuttle Fields , about 12 Yards distance from one another , with Pistols in their Hands , that they advanced very boldly toward each other till they were within 4 Yards , and then fir 'd at one another . That the Deceased dropt , and the Prisoner lifting up his Hands in token of Sorrow , willingly surrender 'd himself , and offer 'd one a Guinea , and another a Half-Guinea to go for a Surgeon . It further appear 'd , that a Surgeon was sent for , who dress 'd the Deceased 's Wound upon the Spot , and sent him in a Chair to a Gardiner 's House . He being ask 'd by several of his Friends , as well as others , the Occasion of the Dewel , reply 'd to this effect : That the Prisoner was a Man of Honour , and acted like a Gentleman ; and desir 'd his Friends to be spoke to , least one Misfortune should follow another , and that he heartily forgave him , & c. It further appear 'd , that he said he was challeng 'd , but gave no Account after what manner , whether by Word of Mouth or by Writing . Neither did it appear from him by whom he was challeng 'd , but when his Papers were taken out of his Pocket , a Relation of his had receiv 'd one , among the rest , ( but from what hand he did not know ) which he put into his Pocket , and read after the Deceased was dead , and found it to be a Challenge . It is as follows . SIR , May 8th , 1711 . I shall be able to go abroad tomorrow Morning , and desire you will give me a Meeting with your Sword and a Brace of Pistols , which I insist on . The worthy Gentleman who brings this will concert with you for the Time and Place . I think Tuttle Fields may do well . Hide Park is at this time of Year full of Company . I am Your very Humble Servant , Richard Thornhill . This Challenge being produced in Court , a Person of Honour , one of the Prisoner intimate Friends , who had seen his Hand frequently , being ask 'd whether he believ 'd it to be the Prisoner 's Hand , reply 'd , that according to the best of his Knowledge it was not , for he us 'd to write in another sort of Character ; but a Foot-boy belonging to the Prisoner having the Letter shewn to him , said he did believe it to be his Master 's Writing , upon which it was read . The Prisoner in his Defence produc 'd Evidence , to prove how much he was abus 'd by the Deceas 'd ; how that from the time of his Wounds given , he hath lain in inexpressible Pain and Anguish , so that he could take only Broth and small Beer , for almost a Fortnight , for his Sustenance , was thrown into a Fever , and his Life dispair 'd of , and his Jaw-bone at this time in great Danger of mortifying , and the Necessity of loosing more of his Teeth . He further prov 'd , that the Morning the Dewel was fought , the Deceas 'd sought after him , came at 6 in the Morning to Kensington , where he formerly lodg 'd , to enquire where he then lodg 'd ; that he came by 7 to his Lodging in a Hackney-Coach , with a Brace of Pistols in his Hands ; went in , and run up Stairs , and was let into his Dining-Room . Upon which the Servant acquainted the Prisoner , that Sir Chelmley was there , that the Prisoner then got up , and ask 'd him whether he would drink a Dish of Tea , or any small Beer , the Deceas 'd chose the latter ; and when he had drank , and the Prisoner was dress 'd , they both went down and took the same Coach the Deceas 'd came in , and went directly to the Place where they fought the Dewel ; and as to the written Challenge , the Boy that swore to it , swore likewise , that he never saw him write in all his Life time , and so might possibly be mistaken . The Prisoner likewise produc 'd a great Number of Witnesses , Men of Quality , that had been his intimate Friends and Acquaintance from a Boy ; all which gave him the Character of a very kind , affable , and courteous Gentleman , never given to Quarrelling in the least : And on the contrary , produced Evidence , who prov 'd the Deceas 'd was unhappy that way ; he likewise produc 'd Evidence , who prov 'd his Serviceableness to the Deceas 'd in his Election for Member of Parliament , of his expending several Hundreds of Pounds in his Service , and procuring about 800 Votes for him ; and that there had been an entire Friendship between them , till this sad Accident . After the Trial was over , the Jury went out ; but return 'd to be inform 'd , whether there was two , or four Pistols mentioned by the Witnesses ; and the Witness to the Fact being call 'd up , depos 'd , that there was four Pistols found in the Field : Upon which they went out again ; and in a little time return 'd , and found him guilty of Manslaughter only .
