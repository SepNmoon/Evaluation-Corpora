Sarah Boreman . I live at the Fox and Knot , on Snow-hill : The Prisoner Felton , was my Servant this Time Twelvemonth , and went away from me the 11th of August last . About Three o'Clock in the Morning , March 11 , she got in at the Cellar Door , under my Dwelling House , and left her Hoop Petticoat upon the Cellar Stairs , - here it is , my Lord ; then she came up into my Chamber , - I ca n't say I saw her , because 't was dark ; but I heard her pull out three Drawers , from whence she took these Things , which I found again in her Lodgings ; I swear they are mine ; - here 's the two Silver Salts , two silver Cups , a black Silk Apron , & c. & c. all these Things are mine , and I found them nine Days after the Robbery at her Lodgings . The white Hood and the Handkerchief I found upon her , and she own 'd they were mine : I tax 'd her with taking the Things , and she confess 'd she had taken them . Q . Do you know from whence she took them ? Boreman . She took them out of the Drawers , by my Bed-side . Q . When did you see them last , before they were missed ? Boreman . I saw them the Day before . Q . Do you know any Thing of your own Knowledge , concerning the Time or Manner of taking these Goods ? Boreman , I was not sensible of any Thing 'till she came to my Pockets for the Key of the Closet Door , where the Money lay ; 't was this that 'wak 'd me : She opened the Closet Door , and took the Box that held the Money , and was going down Stairs with it ; I heard her brush along , and being surprized I got up , and ran directly to the Closet , but the Box of Money was gone . I thought it must be some body that knew my Room very well ; and I suspected the Prisoner , because she is a Person of a very ill Character . Q . When did you take her up ? Boreman . Nine Days afterwards : And the Moment she saw me , she own 'd every Thing : She got my Hood upon her Head , and my Handkerchief about her Neck . The Prisoner Calwell told me , all the rest of my Things were in her Room , and there I found them : She gave me the Key her self to look for them . This Piece of Gold I had from him , he said he had it of Doll , and she own 'd it was one of the Pieces she took out of my Room . And have not you lost some Cups and Salts , says he , I told him , I believed he knew very well what I had lost . Why , says he , I ask 'd her , if she had not robbed somebody of that Portugal Gold , and those Things , and she told me a Parson had given them to her . Q . What Reason had you to suspect the Man Boreman . They liv 'd together as Man and Wife in that Lodging , and I think the Cellar Door required so much Violence to open it , that it could not be done with her Hands alone . Felton . I 'll ask no Questions ; I only desire to clear this innocent Man . Calwell . I never wrong 'd you of a Penny : Did you find any of the Goods upon me ? Boreman . They were found in your Lodging . Calwell . 'T was her Lodging , not mine : She was in Custody before any Thing was found . Q . Did she break any Doors in Order to get in ? Boreman . She confess 'd she broke open the outer Cellar Door , and got into the Cellar ; then she came up the Cellar Stairs , and broke open the Door at the Top of the Stairs , between two and four o'Clock . Eliz Shropshire . Mrs. Boreman came to me , and told me she had been robb 'd by one who was her Maid , and that a Soldier in the 2d Regiment of Guards , commanded by Capt . Littleer , was concerned with her . Upon this , I went with her to the Captain 's House in the Park , and this Man ( a Soldier ) was there present . We told Captain Littleer the Story , and this Man said , he should see Calwell at 11 o'Clock , and would bring him down to the Captain 's House . He did so , and when he ( Calwell ) came in , he said he knew nothing of the Matter ; 't was true , he said , he had married a Wife with a great deal of Money , and he did not know why he might not wear fine Cloaths . The Captain insisted on knowing what Money he had in his Pocket , and he produced this Portugal Piece of Gold , and said his Wife was with Child by a Parson , and he had sent her Money to take Care of the Child , and this was one of the Pieces which he had from her . We asked him where she might be found ; he told us she was at Mrs. Hamilton 's in Thieving-Lane , and that we must enquire for her by the Name of Dorothy Felton ; afterwards he said , he took the Room for her in his Name , and that we must ask for her in his Name . The two next Witnesses . Row and Alexander went to see for her ; they found her , and brought her to Captain Littleer 's , where she confessed the Robbery , and own 'd she got in at the Cellar Door : The Hood and the Handkerchief she had then upon her . Joseph Row , Serjeant . I was walking in the Park , and Capt . Littleer call 'd me , and told me there was a Warrant against Calwell and a Woman , on Suspicion of breaking open a House . I said , I was sorry for that , for he had told me , he had four Pieces of Gold sent him from one Mr. Boswell a Merchant at Bristol . The Captain asked me if I knew where the Prisoner ( Calwell ) was ? I told him I should see him on the Parade at 11 o'Clock , and would bring him before him . I found him at the Time I expected , and carry 'd him to the Captain 's House , who told him , He fear 'd he was concern 'd in a Roguish Affair , and , if he clearapos ; d himself , he must declare where the Woman was . He sent us to a House by the Dead Wall in St. Martin 's Lane , but she was not there ; then he directed us to Thieving Lane ; and lest the Woman should suspect the Occasion of her being sent for , I bid him give my Corporal the Ring off his Finger for a Token , that he wanted her to come to him , and so we sent him for her : He found her , and told her , if she would come to her Husband at the Captain 's House , the Captain would give them a Furlow . When the Corporal brought her in , Mrs. Boreman was put into another Room , and the Captain asked her , if she was marry 'd to Calwell ; she said yes . Then he asked her how long she had been in London ? and if she had ever been at Service ? She said she had been 11 Months in London , but never had been a Servant . Then Mrs. Boreman came out , and said , she had been her Servant , and asked her how she came to rob her ? Why , says she directly , The Devil put me to it . Mrs. Boreman asked her what she had done with the Plate ? At first she would give no Account of it , but at last she gave us the Key of her Room , and we found there the Cloak and these Silver Things , and nothing else . The Mob and the Handkerchief she had on her at that Time , and they were then taken from her . Then the Captain asked Calwell what Money he had in his Pocket ? and he pull 'd out one of these 36 Shilling Pieces . Upon this we took them before Justice Hilder , and there she own 'd the Fact , and said she had but five Pieces of the Gold , for the Bag broke , and she sav 'd no more of them Q . How did she say she got in ? Row . She own 'd she broke open the House , and when she had taken the Money , she open 'd a Ground-window , and jumping out of Window , a twenty Pound Bag fell into the Street , which was afterwards found by some People with a Candle and Lanthorn , who kick 'd it before them on the Ground . After Justice Hilder had examin 'd them , he committed the Woman to the Gate-house , and the Man to Tothill-fields Bridewell ; they were both put into a Coach , and as they were going to Prison , they fell a fighting , and she call 'd him Rogue , and swore she would do for him . Felton . Did I say I would do for him ? I might have done for him , if I would have sold his Blood , as you and others would have had me . Calwell . Pray , Serjeant Row , have not you known me to have got Money by Recruiting ? Row . Yes ; but not in Town . Calwell . I have got 2 Guineas a Week by recruiting in Town . Q . Were the Doors fast when you went to Bed ? Boreman . Yes , I saw them all fast after One o'Clock ; then I went to Bed , and I saw them broke about Four . John Alexander , Corporal . Capt . Littleer call 'd me to his Door , and desir 'd me to see for Calwell , whereof I did , but I could not find him . When I return 'd to the Captain , I found Serjeant Row had taken him . The Captain asked him where his Wife was ? first he said she was in St. Martin's-Lane ; I went there , but could not find her , so I came back , and then she own 'd she was in Threving-lane ; I went there with his Ring for a Token , and brought her to the Captain . William Baker . On the 17th of March Mrs. Boreman told me she had been robb 'd , and desired my Assistance in apprehending two Persons she suspected . Calwell was found and brought to Capt . Littleer 's House ; the Capt . examin 'd what Money he had about him , and he produced a 36 Shilling Piece of Gold ; which he own 'd he had from the Prisoner Felton . He said likewise , that he had another from her , but he had changed that ; and she confess 'd before the Justice that the Gold which was found upon Calwell was Part of the Money she took in Mrs. Boreman 's House . Felton . My Lord , all I have to say is , to desire you to clear the Innocent ; then I am ready to take my Trial ; he is innocent , - He is in Irons , and has had Punishment enough . Felton . Guilty Death . Calwell acquitted . 5. Thomas Jay , of St. Olave , Hart Street , was indicted for stealing 12 Carolina Deer Skins , val . 5 l. the Goods of David Goddin , Feb. 14 . Mr. David Goddin . I live in French Ordinary-Court , Crouched-Fryars : My House having been broke open , and Money and Plate , having been Stole to a great Value ; I examin 'd my Warehouses , and found a Bag of Ambergrease , and these 12 Carolina Deer-skins missing . I desire Mrs. Tollman may be called . Catherine Tollman . Joseph O'Brian brought 'em into my House , and desired me to let him leave them there for his Partner Tom Jay , the Prisoner . I know nothing else ; I saw they were some sort of Skins . Mr. Goddin . Did not he bid you deliver them to the Prisoner ? Tollman . Yes , and I did so , sometime in February about the Dusk of the Evening . Mr. Goddin . Did not O'Bryan tell you who he had the Skins of ? Tollman . Yes ; he said he had them from his Uncle . Simon Pyke . I am a Leatherseller in the Strand , between Norfolk-Street , and Surrey-Street . The Prisoner , on or about the 14th of February , call 'd on me and asked me if I would buy some Deer Skins : He said he had a Friend , a Sea-faring Man , who had some to dispose of . My Answer was , that if I saw them and liked them , I did not know but I might buy them at a Market Price The Day following the Prisoner and Josiah O'Bryan , came with ten Skins ; and this O'Bryan , the Sea-faring Man , prov 'd to be an Apprentice to one Mr. Garret , a Packer in Bell-Alley , Coleman-Street We soon agreed for the Skins ; I was to have them for Twenty-eight Shillings ; but after the Agreement , I was not satisfied about their Property in them , so I insisted upon Vouchers . Upon this , the Prisoner and O'Bryan said , there was a Neighbour a Publican , one Thomas Bennet , at the Golden Lyon , who could give some Account of them ; but Bennet gave me no satisfaction . Then I sent to Mr. Garret 's in Bell Alley , to know if his Apprentice was a Dealer in Deer-Skins ; Bennet gave me a Caution , and directed me to Mr. Garret 's . Mr. Garret sent me Word that he knew nothing of his Man O'Brian 's being a Dealer , so I stopp 'd the Skins . The Prisoner and O'Bryan were dis-satisfy 'd , and insisted on the Money or the Skins , and were very urgent on the Question ; either the Money or the Skins they would have ; but that did not prevail on me ; I detain 'd them , and told them I would send for a Constable : I sent my Man for one , and O'Bryan went away very fast , and the Prisoner went off afterwards . In the Afternoon the Prisoner return 'd to Bennet 's , to know my Christian Name in order to give me Trouble ; passing by my Shop , I told him , I did not want Trouble , if O'Bryan 's Master would appear for his Servant , the Skins or the Money should be ready . On the Friday following Mr. Garret , O'Bryan 's Master with his Uncle , appear 'd in his Behalf , and told me they were satisfy 'd in some Measure about the Skins , for there was a Piece of Cloth ( they said ) bought and truck 'd for them , and that they were equally concern 'd in the Cloth . These Gentlemen appearing , and the Prisoner being likewise Mr. Garret 's Journeyman , I offer 'd them the Skins ? but Mr. O'Bryan said , as I had the Trouble , I might pay his Kinsman for them and keep them ; so I paid the 28 s. as before we agreed , and took a Receipt from O'Bryan . I sold them afterwards to a Gentleman in Court for two Guineas , and they are here to be produced . Q . Was the Price you gave for these Skins , a common Price ? Pyke . No ; it was a low Price . Prisoner . Did I receive any Money from you ? Pyke . The Prisoner was not in my Shop when the Money was paid , but he was the Person that came first to me about them . Prisoner . Have not you known me many Years ? Pyke . In the Year 33 , he and his Wife was pass 'd upon me , out of the City : I was then Overseer of St. Clements . John Jones . I happen 'd to be in Master Pyke 's Shop when the Skins were offer 'd him , and doubting how they came by them , he went to the Alehouse to enquire after their Characters ; when he return 'd to his Shop , he sent me to Mr. Garret 's with the Prisoner ; as we went along he asked me what Mr. Pyke 's Christian Name was ; I told him Simon , then by G - d I 'll arrest him in an Hours Time ; for O'Bryan and I bought a piece of Cloth for 24 s. and we truck 'd it for these Skins , and if the Man has bit me in them , I am even with him , I have bit him in the Cloth . James Pellisent . I do know them Skin which be here , I have bye them of Mr. Pyke . Mr. Goddin . You do n't interrogate Mr. Pellisent . Q . What would you have me ask him ? It is incumbent upon you to shew they were your 's , and that you lost them . Job How . Here 's three of the Skins we have sworn to already : When we first rummaged the Warehouse , we counted over these Skins , and one of them hit a Piece of Skin off my Thumb , and it bled very much , here 's some of my Blood upon this Skin , - here 's more upon this too , but I shall hardly swear to them . There was 1212 of them when we rummag 'd the 2d of February , and when we rummag 'd them the 7th or 8th of March , these Skins were missing : I believe they are Master Goddin 's , by this Worm-eaten Skin , which I remember , and there 's my Blood upon some of the rest ; - that 's a Circumstance very plain I think . James Desnard confirm 'd How 's Evidence Defence . I am innocent of the Thing ; I recommended the Lad to Mr. Pyke , to sell his Skins to him : they were no Property of mine . I can call several People to my Honesty . Alice Carter , Thomas Sheriff , Richard Powney , John Addington , Samuel Harford , Absalom Norton , Mary Myers , appeared , and gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest Man . Acquitted . 6. James Thompson , was indicted for privately stealing a Silk Handkerchief , value 3s . from the Person of James Deacon the younger , Feb. 18 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7. Ann Mudd , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted , for that she not having God before her Eyes , & c. on Thomas Mudd her Husband , feloniously , treasonably , and willfully , did make an Assault , and with a certain Knife , value 1 d. which she held in her Right Hand , him the said Thomas , in and upon the right Part of the Back , near the Back Bone , did strike and stab , giving him one mortal Wound , of the Breadth of one Inch , and the Depth of 3 Inches , of which mortal Wound he instantly dy 'd .

Feb. 23. John Owen . Mary Standridge , the Prisoner 's Mother , lives in a Cellar in Carnaby Market . The 23d of Feb . I was in the Cellar with Ann Mudd and her Mother ; the Deceased was going by the Cellar Door , and Mary Standridge call 'd him down , when he came to the 3d Step from the Bottom , Ann Mudd struck him a slap in the Face , and he bid her be quiet : She had a Knife by her Side , which she pull 'd out and clapp 'd it down on a Cupboard which was in the Cellar : then , as he stood upon the 3d Step , she struck him again in the Face , and he bid her be quiet . Then she went and sat down in a Chair by the Fire Side , and the Deceased came down and sat in her Lap , and wanted to buss her , she would not let him , so they both tumbled together out of the Chair upon the Ground ; I thought they had been playing together . Q . What happen 'd next ? Owen . The Deceased got up first , and the Prisoner when she was up went to the Cupboard where she had laid the Knife , and hurl 'd something at him . Q . Do you know what it was ? Owen . I ca n't be positive what it was ; I thought it look 'd like a Saucer : After this , she stood some Time at the Cupboard , and then she went to him as he stood in the middle of the Cellar , and he immediately cry 'd out , O Lord ! I am stabb 'd ! I am stabb 'd ! Mother ! Mother ! She has done for me . I ran immediately to call Standrige 's Husband , but when I came back , the Deceased lay on the Ground . Q . Had she any Instrument in her Hand after he complain 'd of being stabb 'd ? Owen . I saw nothing in her Hand . Q . What Distance of Time might there be , between your going to call Standridge 's Husband , and your Return back ? Owen . I was not gone above 2 or 3 Minutes , and when I came back , the Deceased lay on the Ground in his Blood . Q . Was any Surgeon call 'd to his Assistance ? Owen . I went about to see for a Surgeon , but I could not get one . Q . How long did he live ? Owen . About 4 or 5 Minutes , he did not speak one Word after he cry 'd out , he was stabb 'd . Eliz Aggleton . I was sitting on the 3d Step from the Bottom , when the Deceased came down and stood by me ; the Prisoner came to him , and hit him a slap in the Face , and gave him another Blow or two , as he stood on the Step : She had a Knife by her Side , which she laid down on the Cupboard , and then she said she would fight him ; he would not fight with her , so she sat her self down in a Chair , and he went to her , and wanted to kiss her , but she would not let him ; he sat down in her Lap , and she push 'd him away ; then they both fell from the Chair upon the Ground , and she got up , and took some Thing off the Cupboard , and jobb 'd it at him as he stood in the middle of the Cellar , he immediately cry 'd out , Mother ! Mother ! I am stabb 'd , I am stabb 'd , she has done for me ! The very Minute that she jobb 'd , he cry 'd out , and dropp 'd down upon his Backside , and I ran up Stairs to call Standridge 's Husband . Q . After he made this Complaint , how did he fall ? Aggleton . He fell upon his Back-side , and I saw the Blood trickle down the Floor . Q . How long did he live afterwards ? Aggleton . I was gone about 3 or 4 Minutes , and when I came back he was dead . Q . Was he well when he came down Stairs ? Aggleton . Yes , very well ; so I suppose he dy 'd of the Wound . Mr. Justice Lambert . The Prisoner was brought before me , and I ask 'd her how she could be so Cruel as to Kill her Husband ? Why , say 'd she , I stabb 'd him in the Back with a Knife , for Funn The Constable . I was sent for and found the Man Dead ; I carried her before Mr. Justice Lambert , and she told him she did it for Funn . I search 'd for the Knife , at that Time , and could not find it ; but the next Morning her Father brought it to me , and here it is . Peter Maccullough , Surgeon I was sent for by the Coroner to view the Body of the Deceased : I found a large Wound between the 9th and 10th Ribs , on the right Side of the Back-bone ; the Knife had penetrated into the Cavity of the Breast ; the right Lobe of the Lungs was pierced quite through , and a large Blood-vessel , a large Branch quite cut off , which was the Occasion of his Death .

Charles Attwood . I keep a Chandler 's Shop . On the 18 th of February about seven o'Clock at Night , I saw my Shop Door latched with an iron Latch ; I was in a back Room behind the Shop , and a Boy came and told me I was robb 'd : I went directly to see what I had lost , and looking about , I miss 'd the Till , Money , Lock and Key , - all was gone together . The Boy told me he saw them and knew them . Burn . Pray Mr. Atwood , was the Door fast ? Atwood . Yes . Burn The Door was open ; we never broke a Lock in our Lives : We had no Knives , nor any Thing to open a Door with . William Walton , ( the Boy ) I was going of an Errand , and saw the two Prisoners , and Jones the Accomplice at Mr. Atwood 's Door about 7 o'Clock , ( I do n't remember the Night ) but Jones cross 'd the way and stood still : Burn open 'd the Door , and brought out the Till , and left the Door open When Burn came out with it in his Hand ; Jones cross 'd the way to him again , and they all went out together : Burn spoke to Ingram when he came out , but what he said I was not near enough to hear . I knew all of them , and so I told Mr. Atwood . Q . Was it so light at 7 o'Clock in February , that you could know their Faces . Walten . It was dark ; but there was a Lamp by the Door and the Shop Windows were open . I do n't know whether I could distinguish their Faces , if there had been no Lights . Q . Did Ingram and Jones seem to be of the same Company ? Walton , Yes , they were all 3 standing together at the Door , when I pass 'd by them . Burn . Do you know whether the Door was latch 'd or no ? Walton 'T was a Hatch , and 't was fast ; I saw him lean over it and open it , tho ' I can not say I saw him lift up the Latch . Burn . The Door was a Foot open , when I went to the Door : I only went in for a Farthing 's worth of Small-Beer , and the Till was half in , half out , and that was not lock 'd neither . Ingram . Did you see me at the Door ? Walton Yes ; I knew them all 3 very well , and saw all their 3 Faces , but did not speak to them . John Jones . About the middle of February , the 2 Prisoners and I , coming down the Street , saw Mr. Atwood 's Door shut . I cross 'd the Way and stood still : Burn went in and brought out the Drawer , and we ran together to the end of Bell-Alley ; then Ingram perceiving that Burn 's Hand was in the Drawer , - You Rogue , says he , what are you doing , and took it away from him ; there was 23 s. and Eight-pence half-peny in it ; if there was more , Burn sunk it while his Hand was in it . The Money was empty 'd into my Apron , and at the Tobacco-Roll against St. Andrew 's Church in Holbourn we shar 'd it . I had 6d , less than either of the Prisoners , for they said 6d , had been lost , and so to prevent Disputes I took the Loss to my self . We had some Beef-stakes dressing then for our Suppers , but Ingram 's Mother informing us that Mr. Atwood was coming upon us , we went away without eating them . Q . Was the Hatch latch 'd or not ? Jones . Yes , it was ; for he push 'd against it , and it would not open , then he lean 'd over , and lifted up the Latch ? Q . On your Oath , Did you see him lift up the Latch ? Jones . I ca n't say I saw him lift it up , but I saw him lean over , and then it opened . There was a Light in the Shop , but 't was Dark in the Street . Burn . I never touched the Latch with my Hands , and how can he say he saw me lift it up , when he stood on the other side of the way . Jones . I was not more than 3 yards distance from the Door . Burn . My Lord , we had just stole some brass Weights , and the Evidence carried them to his Wife to sell for us , and he came back to us after I came out of the Shop , and said , Charles , have you made the Lob ? Jones . This was half an Hour before . Burn . My Lord , he is an old Rogue ; he brings up Youth to Thievery , and then Swears against them for the sake of the Reward . Ingram . The Night this Robbery was Committed , I was at the Magpye at Holbourn-Bridge , and Burn and Jones came in there ; my Mother persuaded me to go out of the way , and with long Persuasion I did : I knew nothing of these Fellows , not I . To Ingram 's Character , John Ingram , John Thomas and William Gill , appear 'd . Ingram . If the Rogue had not Swore so heartily against me , I could have had 40 more to have appear 'd for me . Burn I serv 'd his Majesty ; but have fell into bad Company ; I was just about to leave off , when the Evidence Jones Swore this against me . * My Lord , when Jones and I , and Ingram , stole the Weights , it wanted half an Hour of Dark , and he only went up the next Alley with them to his Wife , and while he was gone , we did this , so it could not be Dark . * This Declaration , and the Prisoner 's Questions with Regard to the Time , and the Doors being fast , were to make the Burglary doubtful . Both acquitted of the Burglary . Guilty Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 10.

The Goods of Mary Cattle . April 5 . Mary Cattle . The Night these Things were taken , I was a bed , and the hard falling-too of my Chamber Door 'wak 'd me ; I got up directly , and miss 'd my Cloaths ; I saw the Woman at the Chamber Door , and upon my calling out , she dropp 'd the Things , and ran down Stairs into a Room on the next Floor , where she hid her self . When she was taken , she said , she knew nothing at all of the Matter . Samuel Line . I keep the Swan Tavern in the Strand . On the 5th of April , between 11 and 12 at Night , I was behind my Bar , and heard a screaming out ; I ran up Stairs , and found my Servant ( Cattle ) at her Chamber Door in her Shift ; she told me a Woman had been in the Room and had taken her Cloaths , so I took the Candle and went into a Room below , and took the Prisoner from behind the Door , and had her before a Justice , and he committed her . Defence . I was going along the Strand with another young Woman , and we went into this House to drink a Pint . My Companion went up Stairs to enquire for a certain Person , and I went up to enquire after her ; when I came to the Top of the Stairs , the young Woman met me , and screamed out so , that I was terribly frighted : the Gentlewoman is welcome to say what she pleases , but I had nothing upon me ; she did not see me drop any Thing . When the Gentleman came up Stairs , I told him I was an Acquaintance of the Witness . Line . She said no such Thing . Prisoner . I mean 'd , I was an Acquaintance of the Woman that went up Stairs , and I only went up to look for her , and the Witness cry 'd out , and frighted me , as well as her self : - pray , Madam , what Cloaths had I on ? Cattle . I told my Fellow Servants she had a Hat on , and a Velvet Manteel ; but it prov 'd to be a Scarlet Cloak . Q . Was there not another Woman with her ? Line . Yes . Q . Was it light or dark ? Cattle . 'T was very Moon-light ; and there 's a Sky-light on the Top of the Stairs , that I could see very plainly . Line . There was a Man and another Woman came in with the Prisoner , and the Woman did say , she knew something of her , but the Man did not . Prisoner . My Lord , 't is a House that any Gentleman may carry a Woman into , for a Pint of Wine . Acquitted . 12.

Mary Wilson , of St. Andrew Holborn , was indicted , for that she being big with a Male Bastard Child , by the Providence of God the said Bastard Child , did privily bring forth alive , March 22 . And for that she the said Mary , on the said Child did make an Assault , and with both her Hands , the said Child , in a certain Flannel Petticoat , did wrap and hide , ( the said Child being then alive ) by Reason of which wrapping and hiding the said Child was smother 'd , and of which smothering it instantly died . She was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Mr. - Jodrell . This unfortunate Affair happening in my Family , Justice Chamberlen bound me over to prosecute . Before the Prisoner at the Bar was taken into my Service , we endeavoured to make what Enquiry we could into her Character . She was recommended to us , as having been a Servant to Mr. Young , an eminent Druggist in Cheapside . I found she had been five Years in his Service , and that during all that Time , she had behav 'd honestly , soberly , and as became a good Servant . On this Character I took her into my Family , and she continu 'd in my Family 13 Months , and answer 'd Mr. Young 's Character in every Respect . I entrusted her with Money for the Service of the Family , which she always regularly and duly accounted for , and behaved soberly and virtuously , and was a diligent and industrious Servant . My Health calling me into the Country , I left her and a Man-a Footman , in the House ; 't was during that Time that she was seduced by this Servant left in the Family with her . She having behav 'd in this Manner , gave me less Reason of any Suspicion that she was with Child . But on the 23d of March last , my Wife brought me Information that a dead Child was born , and that the Cook-Maid , the Prisoner , was the Mother . I was surpriz 'd at it , in Regard that neither I , nor any of the Servants , nor my Wife , had any Suspicion , that she who behav 'd so well , would have been guilty of such a Fact : But the Child being dead , I thought it incumbent on me to consult a Justice of the Peace ; and I went the same Day , the 23d of March ; it was discover 'd the preceeding Day that the Child was born . About 12 o'Clock the following Day , when it was told to me , I discover 'd it to Mr. Justice Chamberlen ; he came to my House , and thought it proper to send for the Coroner , to make Enquiry . Accordingly the Coroner and Justice Chamberlen , went up and took her Confession in Writing , which I believe will be given an Account of . It was always related in the Family , before the Coroner 's Inquest , and afterwards , that she constantly declared the Child was born dead , and that she never heard it cry , and there was no Marks of Violence upon it . The Justice and the Coroner went up to see it ; some Time afterwards I went up and saw it , and on a View of the Child , there did not appear the least Marks of Violence . And since I have nam 'd Justice Chamberlen , I think I ought to declare , he behav 'd with the greatest Justice as a Magistrate , and with the greatest Tenderness and Compassion as a Christian ; and if my Judgment on Oath may avail , I think from the Character of the Maid while she liv 'd with Mr. Young , and during the Time she liv 'd with me , and from other Circumstances of the Case , the Child was born dead , and it had no Marks of Violence upon it . Q . From the Character and Behaviour of the Prisoner , do you think she would be guilty of the Murder of her Child ? Mr. Jodrell . I declare I think she would not , on any Account whatever . Mrs. Jodrell As Mr. Jodrell has said before , she behav 'd with that Manner , that we had not the least Suspicion , till Wednesday the 23d of March , when on a little Rumour I heard in the Family , I went up into her Chamber , and by looking into her Bed , I thought a Child had been born : I came down and acquainted Mr. Jodrell with it : He desired me to take Nurse Carpenter ( who has liv 'd 23 Years in our Family ) with me , I asked her if she had had a Child born ; she fell on her knees and said , For Christ 's Sake forgive me , there has been one , but 't was born dead . I asked her , what she had done with it ? She told me , it was in that Box : Upon which I order 'd Nurse Carpenter ( I think ) to look into the Box , and she took it out , and put it into my Lap : I look 'd it carefully over my self , and found no Marks of Violence , in no Manner of Kind . I asked her if she was marry 'd ? She said , no . I asked her who was the Father of the Child ? She told me , the Under Footman , John Gosling , who was left in the House with her . I order 'd her to be put to Bed , and Mr. Jodrell sent for Mr. Justice Chamberlen and the Coroner . I was inform 'd it was proper to see if she had made Provision for the Child , so I looked into her Box , and there found a Bundle of Rags done up together , which , in my Opinion , may be useful on that Occasion ; but there was no Work perform 'd upon them ; for she said she came three Months before her Time : I look 'd farther , and found five Guineas in Money . There were proper Pieces for Shirts and Night-caps ; she said she was mistaken in her Reckoning , and by what I have heard , many an honest Woman had been mistaken in such Cases . Q . How long before you saw the Child , did you apprehend it might be born ? Mrs. Jodrell By her own Confession , the Day before , at 12 o'Clock . She always behav 'd in so modest a Manner , that I was greatly deceiv 'd in her . Q . Do you think she would be guilty of so great an Offence as killing her own Child ? Mrs. Jodrell . Farthest from it of any one : as I am on Oath I think so . Mrs Carpenter . I can give no juster an Account than what my Master and Mistress have done : I question 'd her about it , and she said the Child was dead born , and that was the Reason she call 'd no Assistance . I examin 'd the Child , and not the least Mark of Violence , or any Thing to give Suspicion that she had done any Thing to take its Life away . I think the Child that was at its full Time , but I never saw a Child that was born before its Time , so I am not a proper Judge . Mrs. Jodrell . I was at a Labour , where a Gentlewoman came 2 or 3 Months before her Time , and the Child is alive now , and a Man grown ; it was her first Child ; and this is the only Instance I ever saw . I have been mistaken six Weeks in my own Reckoning my self . Mr. Justice Chamberlen . As Mr. Jodrell has been telling you , he came to me , and informed me of this Misfortune , and I went to the House and saw the Child , and the Coroner 's Inquest sat upon it : The Surgeon is in Court , and he will give a better Account of it . There is her Exation ; she wrote her Name to it , and confessed it to be true . The Examination and Confession of Mary Wilson , taken this 23d of March 1736. `` This Examinant confesseth and saith , That `` yesterday she was deliver 'd of a Male Bastard `` Child , which was born dead : That she wrapped `` it up in a Flannel Coat , and put it into a `` deal Box , and designed to get a Friend to bury `` it privately , that it might not be known to the `` Family . Being asked , why she did not discover `` her being with Child , saith , If any one had `` question 'd her about it , she would have own 'd `` the same ; that she had made no Provision , nor `` told any one of her being with Child ; and that `` she expected it would have been three Months `` longer before she should have been deliver 'd . Mr. Young . The Prisoner at the Bar was my Cook-Maid five Years ; during which Time she behav 'd soberly , honestly , and as virtuously as any I ever had in my Life ; and I believe is very unlikely to be guilty of so cruel a Thing . The Surgeon . At the Request of Mr. Jodrell and the Coroner , I view 'd the Body of this Child ; 't was as fairly born as any Child in the World , and had no Marks of Violence upon it . The Coroner desired me to try the Experiment on the Lungs , which is commonly done on such Occasions 'T is the Opinion of some , That if the Lungs float in Water , 't is a Sign the Child was born alive , and had breathed ; if they do not float , the Child was born dead . On trying the Experiment upon the Lungs of this Child , they floated on the Water . But I think the Certainty of this Experiment may have Objections to it . As for instance , where a Child hath stuck in the Birth a few Minutes , if it comes in the natural Way , it may respire and breath a little ; which Respiration may make the Lungs specifically lighter than the Water , yet the Child may die before 't is born . And without some other Circumstances to corroborate this Experiment , I should be loth to determine thereby positively . I think the Experiment ( where a Person 's Life is at Stake ) too slight to be built upon . The Child was perfectly fair ; and I think the smothering a Child ca n't be effected without some external Marks . Prisoner . I never liv 'd in any Family where any Woman lay-in , and had no Knowledge what was to be done in such Cases . I expected I should not be deliver 'd in 3 or 4 Months ; and when my Master and Mistress was gone into the Country , I intended to make up the Things I had by me . Acquitted . 21. Eleanor Smith , was indicted for stealing 8 Yards of Stuff , 26 Yards of Silk and Stuff Poplin , 3 Yards and a half of Tabby Silk , 2 Yards of Sarsenet , 1 Yard of Sattin , 13 Yards of Silk , 12 Yards of Burdet , 2 Yards of Damask , 7 Yards and a half of Shagreen , 3 Yards of Mantua Silk , 25 Yards and a half of Persian , and a Spying-Glass , the Goods of Arabella Evans , in her Dwelling-House at St. Margaret 's Westminster . March 7 . Arabella Evans . If your Lordship pleases to swear Justice Frazier ; he has an Account of the Goods ; he has seen them all , and will be a Witness for me . Q . Why ca n't you tell what you lost ? Evans . Really they are so many - There 's Things of all Sorts , Damasks , Mantua Silk , Poplin , Stuff . I keep a little Mercer 's Shop , and took this Prisoner for my Maid ; her Master that she liv 'd with before , told me she was honest , but I soon found she had a very saucy Tongue . Here , - where 's the Constable ? There 's Justice Frazier , she own 'd all the Goods to him , and he said he would be a Witness for me . Some of them she cut off of whole Pieces , and sometimes she took the whole Pieces ; I 'll swear they are all my own , and I have got the Remnants to match with some of them . This Italian Mantua Silk , she took to make her self a Gown and Petticoat ; here 's Sattins , Damasks , and every thing ; here 's all Sorts , and here 's the Spying glass . Q . When did you lose all these Things ? Evans . She went away from me on a Wednesday , 't is a Matter of two Months ago . She lay in the Shop , and I suppose she got my Goods , by Piece-meal and Piece-meal , when I was a-bed . Q . Did you miss them while she was with you ? Evans . No , no , I miss 'd them after she was gone , and now I come to look over the Shop , I miss a great many Things more . Q . How come you to think the Prisoner had them ? Evans . O my Lord , I found them upon her ; they were in her Box , in her Lodging in Moore 's Yard , by Church-court . Q . Were they all found in her Lodging ? Evans . Part in her Lodging , and Part where she had left them , in order to their being pack 'd up and sent off . When I own 'd the Goods , she begg 'd me not to prosecute her ; - but why Nelly , says I , did you do so ? Why the Devil pospossess 'd me I think , said she . She told me that a Maid , who was an Acquaintance of her 's , came to see her , and advis 'd her not to cut off any more Bits , but to take the whole Pieces . Q . Where were the other Things found ? Evans . I found some in Feather 's alley . Here , why do n't some of the Witnesses speak too ? Why this Bundle I found at Mrs. Jane Tyree 's in Feathers-alley , and the Goods in it are Part of what I lost . Q . How do you know she carry 'd them there ? Evans . Why she own 'd she did . Ask her upon her Oath if she did not ? If you require any more Questions - I say these are my own Goods ; I can say no more . Prisoner . She swore to a great many of my own wearing Things ; she took the very Pins and Aprons out of my Box . Evans . O , the Creature ! She took all my Grandchild 's Frocks , which cost me 14 s. apiece . Prisoner . She took the Gown off my Back , and her Pretence was , that she could match it in her Shop . Evans . Pray let Mr. Justice Frazier be sworn . Charles Walker Mrs. Evans brought me a Search Warrant , and I executed it . In her Lodgings we found a Poplin Gown , made up , and some of the same Stuft . While we were searching the Prisoner came in , and I secured her ; we found several Things more , which have been ever since in my Custody . The best Part of the Goods was found in her Box , and Mrs. Evans was present . When we were going to the Justice , the Prisoner desired us to stay a little , and she would tell us where the rest of the Things were . Mrs. Evans taxed her with a Piece of Burdet , and she said , she had sold that to an Old Cloaths-Man , and hoped her Mistress would not prosecute her . We carry 'd her before Mr. Justice Frazier , and he committed her that Night . This first Search was on Saturday , and on Sunday I was sent for again , to the same House , and we found some Trifles . On Monday we search 'd Tyree 's House , in Feather's-alley , in St. Martin's-lane , and there we found all the Things which were not made up . Q . How come you to search Tyree 's House ? Walker . The Prisoner was in the Gatehouse , and Mrs. Tyree came to Evans and inform 'd her , that probably , some of her Goods might be found in her House . I asked her if any one was concerned with her , and she told me a Maid that used to come for Victuals in a Morning , advised her to it , and not to cut Bits off , when she had the same Opportunity to take the whole Piece . She told me , this Maid lodg 'd some where at an Alehouse in the Hay market , but would not say who she was , nor tell me the House ; only she said , she was a Welch woman . Jane Tyree My Husband is a Taylor : We live in Feathers-Alley , but we keep a Stall against St. Martin's-Court . The Prisoner brought this Bundle to me , one Morning before I went to my Husband in his Stall , and desired me to take care of that Bundle for her , and told me , there was a great deal of Money 's worth in it . I put it into our Room and went to the Stall to work . When we came Home at Night , she came again , and asked for her Bundle , come says she , I 'll show you what I have got , and so she open 'd the Bundle . Why , says I , you have bought a great many good Things ; yes , says she , pray lend me a Yard : I bought all these Things in Piccadilly . When she had measur 'd them , she said , the Measure was rather too short ; why if 't is so , says I , carry them back to the Man . No - she would not she said , for tho ' the Measure was short , - she had them cheap enough , and I must keep them , 'till she call 'd for them . This was on the Thursday , and on Sunday following , a Man came from the Gatehouse and enquired in the Alley for one Tyree ; he found us out , and look 'd like a credible Person . He asked me if I knew one Eleanor Smith . I told him no , for I did not know her Sirname : She knows you , says he , and she desires you to come to her ; she is in the Gatehouse for thievery ; so after Dinner I went , and she desired me to send her the Bundle , and I told her she should not have it ; then she desired my Husband to pawn it , and bring her the Money , and she would satisfy him for his Trouble , but he said he would not do such a Thing for an hundred Pounds . After this we found out Mrs. Evans , and she own 'd the Goods . Esther Boyle . The Prisoner lodged in my House . On Saturday May the 5th , Mrs. Evans and another Person enquired for her , and told me they had a search Warrant ; they found this Poplin Gown made-up , and these other Things in her Box which Mrs. Evans own 'd . She sent the Box into my Apartment by a Porter , and when Mrs. Evans and the Constable came to search , she was not at Home , but she came in before they had done searching , and I fell upon her , and call 'd her all to pieces for being guilty of such a Thing ; tho ' what she had at my Apartment , were but trifling Things . Before the Justice , the Prisoner own 'd a Piece of blue Burdet to be Mrs. Evans 's , and promis 'd to let her have it again , and there was likewise some Remnants found in her Box , which the Prosecutor own 'd . George Ewell . I was present when the Prisoners Lodging was search 'd , and when the Things were found ; she confess 'd she had taken a Piece of Burdet , and promis 'd ( if her Mistress would let her go ) she would help her to it again : She said the same before Justice Frazier , and the Justice told her , if she would tell where it was , he would send for it ; then she began to equivocate , and said she had sold it , to an Old Cloaths-Man . This was on Saturday , and on Monday the rest of the Things were found at Tyree 's , and the Burdet among them . Benjamin Evans and Mr. Justice Frazier confirm 'd the before-given Evidence . Prisoner . It was a Woman that lay a Fortnight with me , that took them : I know nothing of them . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 22.

I only swear this Coat is mine : I carry 'd it to be scower 'd at Mary Myers 's , and she told me it was stolen out of her Window . Mary Myers . Mr. Uriel brought this Coat to me to be scower 'd , and somebody stole it the 18th of March . Richard Heatley . The Prisoner brought this Coat to sell in Rosemary-Lane . A Man that lives there agreed to give him 8 s. for it , but was dubious about his Property in it ; I being present , the Prisoner said , if I would go with him , he could satisfy me about his Character ; so I went with him to one Bigs 's against St. Giles 's Church , but he was not to be spoke with ; then he carry 'd me me to another Place , and at last to his Father 's , and his Father came back with us , to the Man that was to buy it ; but he not liking the Men , would have nothing to do with , so they had it away again . Some little Time afterwards , Mrs. Myers came to the Shops in Rosemary-Lane to enquire after such a Coat ; I found the Prisoner out and got him committed ; this is the Coat . Myers . This is Uriel 's Coat . Uriel . This is the Coat I carried Myers to clean . Defence . I went to Rosemary-Lane to buy a Coat , and as I was going along , I met a Man with this upon his Arm , and I bought it ; 't is a great deal too little for me indeed , but as it came cheap , I bought it ; I gave 6 s. and a full Pot of Beer for it . Q . This is a good Defence ; can you call your Witnesses and prove it ? Prisoner . No , I have no Witnesses . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 24. Susanna Moore , otherwise Page , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 4 l the Goods of William Webb , from the Person of Robert Thompson , March 18 Robert Thompson . I was coming thro ' St. James 's Park the 18th of March , about 9 o'Clock at Night , and the Prisoner met me . We were acquainted before ; Robin , says she , what makes you out so late to Night , are you come away from your Master ? No , says I , I am just come from Kensington with my Master 's Watch , and I am going Home with it as fast as I can . I went away from her a little Way , and she call 'd me back again , Robin , Robin , says she , give me one Kiss ; I did so , and went from her again ; but I had not gone far , before I miss 'd the Watch . Upon this I ran back and catch 'd her ; I challeng 'd her with it , and another Woman that was with her , but she ran away . I held the Prisoner , and while I was charging her with the Watch , a Man came up and ask 'd me what Business I had with his Wife ? but one of the King 's Footmen coming up with a Flambeau , he ran away , and I brought her down to Spring-Gardens , and asked her to give me the Watch again : She made no Answer at all , so I carry 'd her to a House , and gave her a Pint of Beer , yet she would not give it me , and somebody at this House knowing my Master , sent for him , and he brought this Gentleman with him ; they likewise asked her for it , but she would say nothing about it , she would not say whether she had it , or had it not , only she own 'd she saw it in my Hand . My Master sent for the Marshal 's Man , and she was search 'd , but we could not find it . Q . Where does your Master live ? Thompson . At the George in King-street , Westminster . Prisoner . He was talking with two other Women when I came up to him ; so I pass 'd him , and 't was he that call 'd after me . William Blackman . On the 18th Day of March , - as I verily believe it was , - in the Evening , there came a Man , - they call 'd him an Hero-man , and inform 'd Mr. Webb ( as how ) his Boy had lost his Watch ; I went with him to the House where the Boy and the Woman were detained . I requested and desired , and said to her , I understand by the Story , you have got the Watch , for God 's sake make Restitution : For all I requested and desired her so much , she only laugh 'd at me , and bid me kiss her A - se , and I know not what besides , and somewhat else , not fit to repeat to the Honourable Court . So next Morning we went before the Justice , - and a very worthy honourable Gentleman he is , and he examin 'd her in a very handsome Manner indeed ; he examin 'd that Mrs. Susannah Moore , otherwise Page , concerning the Premisses , but she would say nothing at all about it ; so the Justice was so good , my Lord , as to commit her to Newgate : And-when we were all coming out at the Door , she told the Lad , if she had a Knife about her , she would stab him in the Jaws . Where 's Mr. Webb ? He 's somewhere in Court , - I 'm sure I have been here these 3 Hours . William Webb . I sent Thompson to fetch my Watch , and he told me this Woman pick 'd his Pocket of it in the Park , that 's all I know , only the Woman has a very bad Character . Blackman . So far I can say , that the Lad is a sober just young Man , and would not do wrong to any one . Q . Yes , he is sober and silly too . What Pocket did you put the Watch into ? Thompson . My left Coat Pocket . Prisoner . As I came cross the Park , he pick 'd me up , and after we had shook Hands , I parted with him ; afterwards he came back , and said , I had robb 'd him . I told him I knew nothing of it , and they searched me , and found nothing upon me . Acquitted . 25 , 26.

John Wright , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for feloniously and maliciously setting Fire to the House of Arthur Rawlinson , about the Hour of Two in the Night , April 8 . Harry House . About the Time mentioned in the Indictment , we were call 'd up by an Alarm of Fire . Mr. Rawlinson was in the Country , and I lay in the House . When I came down to the Door , I found a large Quantity of Straw , but the Fire was put out . I went out with some Watchmen , and we found the Prisoner loitering about the House between 1 and 2 ; we asked him what Business he had there , he told us he only sat out of the Rain ; ( for it rain 'd very hard ) . We then desired him to go about his Business , and he swore at the Watchman for turning him away . At Charing-Cross we found him again upon a Bulk ; we turn 'd him away from thence , and we went to search the Night Cellars for suspicious Persons : when we returned Home , we found him again before our House , so I charged the Watchman with him , and he was carry 'd to the Watch-house for that Night , and next Morning he was brought before Mr. De Veil , there he confessed the Fact , and the Justice took his Examination . Mr. De Veil . When the Prisoner was brought before me , I did not find any Proof of the Fact charged upon him , but he was pleased to acknowledge it himself . He told me he had been in a melancholy Way , and that he did this , in Order to be Hang 'd . He behav 'd Modestly , but he seem 'd to be in a very heavy dull Condition , and said , he wanted to get out of this Life , and in order thereto , he committed this Fact . As he confes 'd the Fact , I thought it my Duty to Commit him , that it might appear whether he was compos Mentis or not . George Bannister . I was leaning out of my Box , between One and Two in the Night , and saw a smother at Mr. Rawlinson 's Door ; I went out and found this Basket and a great deal of Straw against the Door , and a lighted Candle was put into it , and the Candle was cover 'd likewise with Straw . I did not see any Body put it there , but when I took it away , I heard some body curse me , and swear the House should be down before Morning . He confessed that he put a Piece of Wax-candle into the Straw first ; but that not doing , he bought a Tallow one for this Purpose . David Wetherhead . About five or six Weeks ago , I was a Bed with him , and he told me the House was on Fire below Stairs , and would not be easy till I went down to put it out . I told him there was no Fire ; however , to satisfy him I went down , and found every thing safe . He always look 'd very melancholly . James Wallis . One Lord 's Day Morning I was in Company with him , and he told me he was damned to all Eternity . I have known him three Months , and take him to be disorder 'd in his Mind . Thomas Atkin . I was in Company with him another Sabbath-Day Morning , and I heard him say before a great Society , that he was damned to all Eternity . He has been very melancholly three Months . William Taylor . I have known him above a Year : I took him for a very sober Lad , but I have heard of his falling in strange Phrenzies and Disorders of Mind . I went to see him in Prison , and asked him what he mean 'd by this strange Act of his ? I ask 'd him if he had any Design to plunder , or had any Resentment against the Man of the House . No , he had no View he said , but only to the ending his Days . I think him distemper 'd in his Mind , and that he is of a very melancholly Disposition . Thomas Rowel . I have known the Prisoner a Twelve-month ; he 's a very sober Fellow , and a Shoe-maker by Trade : He is not addicted to Liquor , but lives in all Sobriety . I have heard some People say , they were afraid he would hang or drown himself . Acquitted . 30.

I lost this Clock off the Stair-case , and advertis 'd it , but heard nothing of it , some Thieves being taken up at Westminster , one of them turn 'd Evidence , and inform 'd me , that the Clock was at one Mrs. Garton 's , a Pawn-broker in Long-Acre . Samuel Steere . I gave this Clock to Mr. Newman ; it had been in my Possession and hung in my Chamber at Christ-Church in Oxford , 2 Years . I know it from an hundred ; there are Holes in the Case to hang it against the Wainscot , and the Pendulum is a little bent . I sent it from Oxford to Mr. Newman 's . Ann Garton . I am a Pawnbroker , a single Woman . The Prisoner at the Bar lodged in Red-Lyon Court , in the House of one Reeves ; the Prisoner and Reeves brought the Clock to me , and I lent half a Guinea upon it . I am sure the Prisoner was the Person that brought it to me , and he order 'd me to deliver it to no body but him . Charles Walker . There were some People taken up on Suspicion of uttering false Money , and one of them turned Evidence , and inform 'd about this Clock , and where it might be found . He said it was stole by one Liberty , from Mr. Newman 's in Holborn . I acquainted him with what I had heard , so he got a Warrant , and found this Clock at Mrs. Garton 's , which she deliver 'd to us . Defence . Liberty brought this Clock one Night into my Lodging , and Mr. Reeves pawn 'd it for him the next Morning at this Gentlewoman 's .

I would ask Mrs. Garton a Question : In the Way of your Trade ( and 't is a very bad one ) do n't you enter the Names of Persons who bring you Goods , and the Money you pay them , in Books ? Mrs. Garton . Yes . The Prisoner said it was his , and he bid me enter it in the Name of Thompson , and deliver it to none but himself . Guilty 39 s. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 34. James Carter , of St. George 's Middlesex , was indicted for assaulting Thomas Orrel on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from a Silver Watch , value 3 l. 3 s. and 8 s. in Money . April 15 . Thomas Orrel . On the 15th of April I was at Mr. Essex 's Ball , in Old Gravel Lane , Wapping , and between 1 and 2 in the Morning I was coming from thence with four Women ( and a young Fellow to light us ) to my Lodging at Mrs. Wetherden 's by Bell-Dock . We were set upon near Broad-Street ( Wapping ) by the Prisoner and another Man . He at the Bar clapp 'd a Pistol to my Breast , and bid me stand and deliver , or I was a dead Man : This he repeated two or three Times . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man , for we had a Lanthorn before us , with two Candles in it , and I could distinguish his Face very plain . He was at Work but the Day before , scraping the Ship that I belong to ; I knew him again , and am positive he was the Man : He took my Watch , and 8 s. in Money from me , and made off directly with his Consort . My Company ran away when they saw I was attacked by two Men . Prisoner . I was a Bed that Night before Ten o'Clock . Pray what Cloaths had I on ? Orrel . The same dirty Py'd-Jacket that you have on now . Prisoner . By what other Marks do you know me ? Orrel . By your one Eye . Prisoner . Why there 's more Men than my self who have got but one Eye - You are very positive Sir . Mary Wetherden . I was coming home with Mr. Orrel from the Ball , and a Man came up and bid him stand and deliver , and be quick , or he was a dead Man . I turn 'd my self round , and seeing another with a Club at my Elbow , I ran away ; so I ca n't say , I saw either of their Faces . Sarah Lakeman . I was present when a shabby sort of a Man stopp 'd Orrel ; I ran away , and ca n't be positive to the Prisoner . John Richardson . I was the Person that li't them home from the Ball between One and Two . Mr. Orrel was attack 'd by two Fellows at the End of Johnson-Street : One of them pass 'd me and pull 'd out a Truncheon : After he had pass 'd by , I turn 'd about , and saw the Back of the Man that had stopp 'd Mr. Orrel , and he held a Pistol to his Breast . I heard him say , - Sir your Money , or you are a dead Man ; upon this , the Company that was with him , ran away and left him , and I made the best of my Way after them , - that 's the Truth o n't . Mary Miller . I was one of the Company , and as soon as I saw the two Men come , I ran away too . Prisoner 's Defence Mary Miles . I was in Company with all these Gentlefolks at the Ball . There was a Man stopp 'd Mr. Orrel as we came Home ; I was frighted and took up my Heels and ran as fast as the rest of them . When we got Home I would have had a Gentleman to have gone back with Mr. Orrel to see for the Thieves ; No , says he ( Orrel ) I do n't chuse to go back again , for I do n't know the Man . Mrs. Wetherden said , I have a Suspicion of the Man that scrapes your Ship , I 'll call him in , in the Morning to look at my Birds : Mr. Orrel was not positive to the Man over Night , but next Morning he was , and yet he told the Justice 's Clerk afterwards , he could not be sure , whether he was the Man , or not . Congrave Laws , Richard Heatly , John Leach , and George Bell , gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest , hard-working Man . Joyce Allen . I live in the House with the Prisoner . I did not see the Prisoner , but I heard him at Home , half an Hour after 10 o'Clock . Jane Kennington . I live right facing his Window ; the Night this Robbery was committed , I saw him come Home about 9 , and I saw him get up next Morning and go out ; ( whereof ) he asked me what it was o'Clock , and I told him between six and seven . Mary Pearce . I had left my Place , and could go no where else to lodge , but in his Apartment ; so they made me up a sort of a Bed upon the Floor , in the same Room where he and his Wife lay . He went that Night to bed about 10 , and never went out 'till between 6 and 7 next Morning . I was awake between whiles in the Night and talked to him . On my Oath I am sure of this . James Warrener . Last Friday the Prisoner was carrying before Justice Farmer , and the Officer brought him into the Angel in Well-close-square . Mr. Orrel desired to speak with me in private in a back Room ; there he told me that he had taken the Prisoner on Suspicion , but that he neither could , nor would swear to him . I imagin 'd upon this that the Justice would discharge him , but when he came before him , he swore positively to the Man . Orrel I did ask this Gentleman if he could save his Life , - I said no farther than that . Q . Did not you declare that you would not swear to him ? You are upon your Oath . Orrel . I said I was positive to the Man , when I talked to this Gentleman in the back Room . Acquitted . 35 , 36 , 37 , Richard Blunt , William Powle , and William Star , were indicted with Joseph Drummond , not taken , for stealing 18 Pieces of Silk for Handkerchiefs , value 6 l. one piece of Cambrick for ditto , value 18 s. five pair of worsted Stockings , value 18 s. the Goods of William and Latchlin Ross , in their Shop in the Parish of Kensington , March 10 . William Ross . On the 11th of March about five in the Morning , a Watchman came from St. Giles 's , and knock 'd us up , and enquired if we had not been robb 'd ? we found that a shew Glass near the Window had been broke , and it must have been done before the Shop was shut up , for the Shutters of the Window were whole and fast . The Goods mention 'd in the Indictment , were taken out of this Shew-Glass , which I am sure was whole ( and the Goods were in it ) about a Quarter of an Hour before we shut up the Shop . Latchlin Ross . His Evidence was to the same Effect . Edward Haines . We set out from - Q . How old are you ? Haines . I was 14 last October . Q . Do you know the Nature of an Oath ? Haines . Yes ; I should not take a false Oath against any Body , if I do , I shall go to Hell ; the Devil will have me , and I shall burn in Fire and Brimstone for ever . - We set out from Blunt 's Cellar to Kensington the 10th of March ; it was not quite Dark when we got there , so we walked up and down 'till Kensington Clock struck eight . Then we came to this House , and Powel took a Knife and cut the Putty from a Pane of Glass and took the Glass out ; then he let some of the Glass fall down , and I took the rest out of his Hand and put it into a Cart-rut . When he had clear 'd the Glass out , he took out the Silk Handkerchiefs and I took out four Pieces more , and five Pair of Stockings : then the Prisoner Starr came up , and he took out several more ; how many , I can not tell . Blunt and Drummond took out more . Powel made me try again , and I got more ; but we observing a Gentlewoman to stand at some Distance , we were afraid of being discover 'd , we bundled up the Things and carried them in our Bosoms and Pockets to Blunt 's Cellar in Church-Lane , St. Giles 's . ( in this Cellar he sells Gin , and harbours Thieves and Pickpockets ) When we came to Blunt 's , we found there were seventy Handkerchiefs , and five pair of Stockings ; that was one Pair for each of us , and the odd Pair was made a Present of to Blunt 's Wife . We intended to sell all we had got the next Day , so we bundled them up again , and put them under Blunt 's Bolster , and then we all went to Bed . Presently after this , Mary Steel , Drummond 's Wife came in and told us , that Blunt would certainly cheat us out of some of the Goods , because we were ( all of us ) drunk so William Starr went to Blunt 's Bed , and would have the Goods from under his Bolster . Blunt would not part with them , but after some high Words , he threw them at him , and got out of Bed in his Shirt and charged the Watchman with Starr , and Starr charged the Watchman with Blunt . So the Discovery was made . Q . How long have you been acquainted with this Company ? Haines . Not above three Months : My Father sent me to Tothill Bridewell , for stealing some Half-pence from him , and there I got acquainted with Starr . We us 'd to be at Blunt 's Cellar all Day , and at Night we us 'd to turn out . If we had no Money he 'd trust us , even to the value of 5 s. He supply 'd us with Gin , and boil 'd two-penny Mutton Chops for us . I came acquainted with Powel , at one Marget Fox 's in Church-Lane , who was cast last Sessions for Transportation . Powel would have been glad to have been made an Evidence that he might have sav 'd Starr , for Starr and he were born at Bristol , and were Townsmen . Q . Does Blunt sell Gin , in his Cellar now ? Haines . Now - no not now , - but his Wife does . Lawrence Nott , Constable . Between twelve and one at Night March 10 , Blunt came into the Watch-house in his Shirt , and Powel was with him ; they called one another Thieves , and Powel said , he could carry me where I might take ten Thieves more . As I was going to take these ten Thieves , I met this little Boy ( the Evidence ) and Blunt 's Wife , coming along with the Goods . Powel carry 'd us to Blunt 's Cellar , where we found Drummond and five Boys more . I intended Powel for an Evidence , but Mr. De Viel not thinking him ingenuous in his Confession , admitted this Boy ( Haines ) to be one . Susannah Strooper , Ruth Beaumout , Robert Worral , John Bird , and Susan Butler , appear 'd to Blunt 's Character . Prisoner Blunt . They did come to my Habitation with about Half a Guineas-worth of Things , and afterwards when I was asleep , they brought in more and put them under the Beds Head , and my Wife and her Sister serv 'd them , out of the Gin that I keep for my own drinking , to the Value of 2 s. 4 d. farthing . I found something was under my Head , and mistrusting 't was not honestly come by , I jump 'd out of Bed and accused them ; they said they would swear my Life away , so carry 'd some of them to the Watch-house , and order 'd the Things to be carried to the Constable of the Night . Blunt to Haines Did I ever sell any Thing for you , or take any Thing in Pawn from you ? Haines . Powel sold him a pair of ribb 'd Stockings , but the Day before he was taken up . As he entertained us , we generally was in his Debt , so whatever we got , we brought to him , and left them with him till they were disposed of , and then we always paid him what we ow 'd him . We ow 'd him about a Crown when this Quarrel happen 'd , and he would not be content to have 2 or 3 Pieces of Handkerchiefs , and that occasion 'd this Riot . He was indeed at the taking of them , and got as many of them , as any one of us all . Starr 's Defence . In the first Place , my Lord , Haines and I , and 2 or 3 young Women , went to see the Men hang in Chains , and as we came back thro ' Kensington , one of our Company said , there 's a Chance for some Bird-ey 'd Handkerchiefs ; so we came to Blunt 's , and resolved to set out the next Day : Accordingly next Day we went to one Adley 's , and there we all din 'd , and at 3 o'Clock we went to Kensington to rob this Man 's Shop ; we walk 'd 2 Hours 'till 't was dark , then Powel took out his Knife and cut the Putty , and took out the Glass , - so we got the Goods . Edward Brothington a Soldier . I supp 'd with Blunt , in his Cellar the 10th of March , and a quarter after 8 , I saw him go into Bed . Haines . My Lord , this very Soldier was in the Cellar when we all came back from Kensington : All Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 38.

I carried the Sausages and 2 s. to him there , and delivered them to him ; then he sent me back for a Pound of Pork Stakes , and before I was gone from the Door , I saw him run down North-Street ; I follow 'd him , and call 'd stop Thief , and he was taken at the Bottom of Gloucester-Street .

No . V.p . 147. Joseph Mansfield . I am 'Squire Harvey 's Servant at Chigwell , and carry their Linnen and Things backward and forward ; for my Master Harvey has a Town House and a Country House . Mrs. Harvey delivered the Trunk to me in Gerrard-Street , to carry in the Cart to Chigwell ; as I was driving down Monmouth street , Richard our Butler came to me , and told me , I must stay there 'till he went back for a Key , I did so , and when he gave me the Key , he said these Words , - as how I must meet him with the Waggon on Wednesday at the Victualling Office , to take up a Load of Oatmeal . When he had told me this I drove along , and when I had got to White-chappel , a Man came to me and said , as how he came from Mrs. Harvey , and he must have the Trunk , for she wanted some Linnen out of it , by the same Token , ( says he ) you have got the Key in your Pocket , and you are to come up on Wednesday to the Victualling-Office , and Richard the Butler is to meet you there . I believed this Man , and let him have the Trunk ; I hope ( help 'd ) it out of the Cart my self , and put it upon his Shoulder , and instead of carrying it to our London House , he carried it quite away . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man . Councel . Did not he give you some Token , some Reason to make you believe he came from your Mistress ? Mansfield . Yes , but if I must tell all that , I must begin the Story all over again . Councel . The Prisoner is indicted , because some body has made a Fool of the Man . C I remember a late Case here of the same kind : + Dr. Turners 's Daughter left a Box at a Bakers , and 't was deliver 'd to a Man , who told the Baker he came from her to fetch it away . 'T was looked upon as a Deceit , and not as a felonious taking away . + See Joseph Gillam 's Indictment , Sessions Book , 1736 . No . IV.p . 105 . Councel . You do n't know what was in the Trunk ? Mansfield . No , I did not see the Things put up . Susan Singleton . I have nothing to say against the Prisoner , but I was at the putting up the Things into the Trunk . I ca n't remember every Particular , but there was ten Shirts , six Table-cloths , - more Towels than I can name ; eight bird-ey 'd Napkins , three Shifts , and six Aprons of mine , and a great many more Things : I saw it go from our Door in my Master 's Cart , and Mansfield drove it . Mary Rouse confirmed the above Evidence . Councel . What Day of the Month was it ? Mansfield . I ca n't remember ; 't is about six Weeks ago , and it was on a Saturday between two and three o'Clock . Singleton . 'T was the 19th of March . Richard Lambert , the Butler , confirmed Mansfield 's Deposition . William Bevis . I was along with the Carter , when a Man ( like the Prisoner ) came to the Cart for the Box from Madam Harvey : He told the Fellow he had got the Key in his Pocket , and must call for the Box , when he came up again on Wednesday . The Prisoner is very like the Man that the Box was deliver 'd to , but I wo n't swear he is the same . Councel . Do you remember what Day of the Month this was ? Bevis . No ; 't was on a Saturday between two and three o'Clock . Prisoner . What colour 'd Cloaths had I on ? Mansfield . A darker Colour than you have on now . Prisoner . I had the same Cloaths on that I have now . Mansfield . I am sure he 's the Man . Councel . The Prisoner had been ill of the Stone and Gout , and the Day mentioned in the Indictment , was the first Day of his going abroad . About 11 o'Clock that Day , he went to a Skettle-Ground , and staid there 'till 9 o'Clock at Night , and the People we shall call to prove this , are People of Character ; so there can be no Doubt of a Fraud in our Evidence . Eliz Dobney . I saw the Prisoner the 19th of March at Mr. Prigmore 's , the Sign of the Black Uncle at Cow-Cross . I saw him there between 10 and 11 , and he staid there 'till between 9 and 10 at Night : He was ill of the Gravel and Stone ; I carried him some Stuff , and went several Times in the Day to see how he did . Q . What Day of the Week was it ? Dobney . On a Saturday Q . How came you to remember 't was the 19th of March ? Dobney . Because he was taken up the next Friday , and then I remember 'd he was at this House the Saturday before . Samuel Prigmore . The 19th of March I saw him at my Brothers , at the Black Uncle ; I went there between 1 and 2 , and I staid and supp 'd there , at past 9 . He was in the House and in the Yard all that Time : I do n't believe he was 10 Minutes missing , while I was there . Sam Prigmore , jun . Another Samuel Prigmore , Edward Taylor , and Mr. Nichols , confirmed the above given Evidence . Mr. De Veil . When the Prisoner was brought before me , he was very lame ; his Wife and he came together , and they put their Defence upon this , - that he was at the Time when this Fact was done , so lame that he could not set his Foot to the Ground , and he and his Wife would have taken their Oaths , that he was not out that Day : but afterward , recollecting himself , he said he believ 'd he was mistaken , for he had been at this Alehouse , and named some particular Persons to his Wife . Acquitted . 45 , 46. William Hurlock , and Samuel Neale , were indicted for stealing 16 pair of Leather Shoes , value 25 s. the Goods of Adam Price , in his Shop , March 21 . Adam Price . The Prisoner Neal is my Journey Man , and Hurlock is my Apprentice ; they collogu 'd together to rob me . Neal confess 'd he had wronged me before Sir Richard Brocas ; and upon my asking him how he got my Apprentice 's consent , he told me he began with him , by persuading him to let him have a pair of Shoes , and he would bring the Money for them in two or three Days , and then he might tell me , they were just sold . William Webster . I have bought Shoes of Neal several Times ; the first I bought of him , he told me he had won at Gaming ; the next I bought of him he said he made himself at odd Times , when his Master had no work for him . I believe I bought 11 Pair of him in all . C. I hope you gave a Market Price for them . Webster . I gave as much as I could afford . Samuel Harrison . When I took Neal and charged him with an Officer , he own 'd in my hearing , that he had robb 'd his Master of 14 or 15 Pair of Shoes . Prisoner Neal When I was first taken they got a Confession out of me , by promising to excuse me . I did carry the Shoes to Webster and he bought them . Hurlock . I know nothing of his having the Shoes . Hurlock Acquitted . Neal Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 47.

Piece , 16 Guineas , three half Guineas , and 3 l. 5 s. 6 d. in Money . I lost all this Money the 16th of February out of a Room up two pair of Stairs . I saw it all there , but the Day before in my Chest of Drawers . One Green was concerned with the Prisoner in the Fact , and it was upon his Information that I charged the Man at the Bar . He had lodged in my House , but had left his Lodging about a Week , and the very Day the Robbery was committed , he had been to pay me a Visit . Prisoner . Did you see me go up Stairs ? Hone . No , I did not . Thomas Bigg . Mr. Hone sent for me , and told me , he believ 'd he had heard of the Men that had robb 'd him ; so I went with him to Shadwell to see for them , and could not find them ; but returning Home , we met the Prisoner in Fleet-street , and carry 'd him before Justice Robe ; there he confess 'd that Green was concerned with him in taking the Money ; that Green took the Money and gave it to him . These are the Instruments they made Use of , in breaking the Door and Drawers , and we found them in a Cistern according to the Prisoner 's Direction . He told us , that he waited at the Foot of the Stairs while the other got the Money , and when he had got it , he brought it to him . He said likewise , that he had bought him a Suit of Cloaths , with the Three-Pound-Twelve Piece , but he would carry us to a Place , where the rest was hid , and accordingly Mr. Hone and I and the Constable went to a Cellar with him , and at the Bottom of the Stairs we found 15 l. ( all but 6 s. 6 d. ) hid in a Bag . Q . Did he tell you that he and the other Person went to the House , on purpose to do this ? N. B . We are obliged for want of Room , to omit several very remarkable Trials , which will be publish 'd on Tuesday next ; among others , are the remarkable Trials of Henry Bosworway , for the Murder of John Moore with a Hammer ; Samuel Moreton , for assaulting John Vaus , and robbing him of a Watch ; Richard Harper , for breaking the House of Richard Holyoke , and stealing a Box with 250 Guineas and other Money ; Mary Brown ( who was indicted by the Name of Mary White , in June Sessions , and convicted for Transportation ) for robbing Mr. Hinchliff .

No ; I do n't remember that ; but he said , the other Person went up Stairs , broke open the Door , and took the Money , and brought it to him at the Bottom of the Stairs , where he waited for him , and that he received it from him . Prisoner . I said no such Thing ; - I said nothing about his brioging down the Money . James Holmes , Constable . This is the Money which by the Prisoner 's Directions we found under the Cellar Stairs , and he said it was all that was left of it . He took it himself from the Place where it was hid , and deliver 'd it to me ; I told it over , - there was 14 l. 13 s. and 6 d. in it , and 't was seal 'd up before the Justice . Hone . This is my Bag . Constable . He directed us to the Instruments , and told us , they were the same with which Green open 'd the Door and the Drawers . William Geeen . After Mr. Hone had been robb 'd , I went to him and told him , I was sorry for his Loss , and knowing the Prisoner to be but a sorry sort of a Fellow , I went the next Day to see him I told him his Cousen Hone had had a Loss , and finding him in a new Suit of Cloaths , I asked him , how he came by Money to buy them ? I am afraid says I , that you have had a Hand in this Affair . He said no , he had not , but Mr. Hone 's Sister had got her Sweetheart ( a Journeyman Taylor ) into his Room ; that this Taylor took the Money , and that he and she divided it between them , and that she had lent him ( the Prisoner ) 5 Guineas to buy him those Cloaths . I let Mr. Hone know this ; he took up the Prisoner , and then he threw the Matter upon me . Prisoner . Green was with me all the while ; He would fabin have perswaded me to have gone on the Highway . I am a poor young Fellow , come out of the Country , and have not any one to stand my Friend . It will go hard with me I know : I beg for Transportation , though it should be for all my Life . Guilty Death . 48. Henry Johnson , of St. Mary le Strand , was indicted for stealing 2 Perukes , val . 30 s. a cloth Coat and Waistcoat , value 30 s. and a camblet Gown , value 4 s. the Goods of William Shooter ; and one Peruke , the Goods of Thomas Larkin , and a Peruke , the Goods of Christopher Wainwright . March 14 . William Shooter . The Prisoner was my Journeyman - according to Perriwig-making ; the Wigs and these Cloaths were taken out of the House unknown to me the 14th , of March . I suspected the Prisoner ; I pursu 'd him the 16 of March , and had the good Luck to find him a Bed at 12 o'Clock at Noon ; so he confess 'd the Robbery , and I got all my Things again . William Foxal , confirm 'd Shooter 's Evidence . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 49. Henry Bosworway , of St. James 's Clerkenwell , was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on John Moore , did make an Assault , and with a certain Hammer , made of Iron and Wood , value 1 s. and which he held in his left Hand , on the Forehead of the said Moore giving him on the Forehead as aforesaid a mortal Stroke , which broke his Skull March 24 , of which mortal Stroke he languish 'd , and languishing lived , from the said 24 of March , to the 10 of April , and then and there Dy 'd . He was a 2d , Time indicted on the Coroners Inquest for the said Murder . William Montgomory . I am a Cabinet ma'er , and the Deceased work 'd with me in the same Workshop . On the 24 of March , the Prisoner came in , and asked the Deceas 'd to toss up for Beer with him ; he told him , he would toss up for no Beer . Then the Prisoner would Fight him for a dozen of Beer , and the Deceased said , No , if he must fight , it should be with a Man , and not with him . Then the Prisoner would measure round ( the Course of ) the Breast with him , to see who was the biggest Man ; but the Deceased refus 'd , and would not measure with him , and gave the Prisoner a little Shove from him ; then the Prisoner lifted up his Hand , and gave the Deceased a Blow on the Breast . Q . Did the Deceased strike the Prisoner , or did he only push him from him , to make him go from him ? Montgomory . He only push 'd him , to make him stand farther , that he might not hinder his Work , and on that the Prisoner struck him on the Breast with his Hand . Upon this the Deceased took him by the Arm , and put him farther from him . Q . Did the Deceased strike him , or only put him away ? Montgomory . He only took hold of his Arm , and run him back to another Man 's Bench ; he ( the Deceased ) was at Work , and had a little Saw in his Hand , and when he had run the Prisoner back , he gave him a little Stroke on the Back , with the Flat of the Saw , - the Stroke would not have kill 'd a Fly . Then the Prisoner , in a Passion , took up this great Hammer , and with his Left Hand , knock 'd down the Deceased immediately ; he fell , and lay about five or six Minutes stunn 'd with the Blow , then he came to himself , and told the Prisoner , he had got his Blood . Q . Was the Skull broke ? Montgomory . Yes . I observed the Wound ; and saw the Skull was broke . Q . Were there no more Blows given ? Montgomory . No . Q . How long did the Deceased live after this ? Montgomory . He died on the 18th Day after the Blow , and he died of that Wound , to my Knowledge ; for he was my Bed-fellow ; I lay with him till three or four Days before he died . Q . In what Condition was he while you lay with him ? Montgomory . He never came rightly to himself ; never had his Judgment , as he formerly had . I saw him die , and I do think he died of the Blow . Prisoner . What he says is all false ; did not he strike me several Times with the Saw , and challenge me to wrestle with him ? Montgomory . No , the Deceased never struck till after he was so molested ; then he gave him a little Slap , with the flat of the Saw , and that was in no Passion at all , not to hurt him ; he was not inclin 'd to do the Prisoner any Harm . Edward Pearson . The Prisoner at the Bar is a Sawyer ; there were four of us Cabinet-maker s work 'd together in a Work-Shop up one Pair of Stairs . The Deceased and we were at Work together , and the Prisoner came up and said , he had been drinking at the Cooper 's Arms at Hockley in the Hole . I asked him what Business he had in our Shop ; because our Master had order 'd us to keep him out , for he was a quarrelsome , troublesome Man . He told me , he had been drinking Part of a Crown's-worth of Beer , and that it had cost him but 2 d. Then he laid himself down to sleep , but another Sawyer coming in , he started up , and said he would toss up with the Deceased for a Dozen of Beer ; the Deceased reply 'd , Yes , I 'll toss up with you , if every one in the Shop will toss up with you too ; and turning to me , I said , prithee have nothing to do with him . Upon this the Prisoner challenged the Deceased to fight or wrestle with him : No , says he , if I fight , it shall be with a Man ; then the Prisoner came to me and said , why , how much less do you think I am , than he is ? so he pull 'd off his own Garter and would measure the Deceased round the Chest ; upon which he gave the Prisoner a gentle Shove from him , for he was at work upon a Desk , and had a little Sash Saw in his Hand . Whether the Prisoner took hold of the Deceased first , or the Deceased , - of the Prisoner , I do n't know ; but I saw the Deceased 's Hand upon the other 's Shoulder , and he gave him a little Tap ( not to kill a Fly ) upon his Back , with the Flat of the Saw . I am sure 't was with no Intent to hurt him , but was only design 'd as a gentle Reprimand , to keep him from hindering his Work . Then the Prisoner struck at him , but could not hurt him , for the Deceased held him by the Arm . He was as sober a Man as any in this Court , and as stout a jolly lusty Fellow as ever I saw I never knew him have a Pint of Beer in the Shop in my Life , except sometimes when we have all joined our Five Farthings a-piece to drink together . C. Go on and give an Account what follow 'd upon the slap with the Saw . Pearson . After the Tap with the Saw , the Prisoner snatched up that great Hammer , and knock 'd down the Deceased at once , as you wou 'd knock down an Ox ; ( and I believe this Hammer is sufficient to knock down an Ox ) . He broke a great Hole in his Forehead , that I could turn my Thumb in , and then he told us , he would pay the Surgeon : The Blow was not given with the flat Face of the Hammer , but with the other End . I ran for my Handkerchief to stop the Blood , as the Deceased lay upon the Ground ; I found he was stunn 'd , and 't was some Time before he came to himself ; then he told the Prisoner , - Sir , you have had my Blood , and then the Prisoner went off . I did not see the Deceased after this , till he was dead , but I believe this was the Occasion of his Death , for there was a great Hole in his Forehead , that you might see his Brains thro ' . Henry Oborn Surgeon . On the 24th of March , I was sent for the Deceased , ( immediately after the Accident ) I found a very large Fracture in the Frontal Bone , on the left Side of the Forehead . It must have been done in a violent Manner , for such a Fracture I never saw in my Life . I attended him while he liv 'd , which was about 17 Days , he died on Easter Sunday , and had no other Illness upon him as I know off . Prisoner . Did you hear the Deceased say nothing with regard to his receiving this Wound . Oborn . No , only that he freely forgave him . Defence . I met with a Friend who made me very welcome , he gave me Part of a Crown's-worth of Beer , and it cost me but two Pence half Penny , and then I thought to have gone to work ; but when I got into the Pit , I found I could not stand to work , so I went up to their Shop to lie down ; some of them disturb 'd me out of my Sleep , so I got up and told them , if they would be a Pot a-piece , I would be 2 Pots , and I went to the Deceased to ask him if he would agree ; he push 'd me away from him , and with a Pannel Saw which he was at work with , above 20 Inches long , he struck me several Blows , and one of the Blows came edge-ways over my Head ; then he would wrestle with me , and I refused , and told him I never wrestled in my Life . After this he dragg 'd me several Yards about the Shop . Q . Have you any Witnesses to contradict what these People have said ? Prisoner . No , my Lord , I never had any angry Word with any of them in my Life . Guilty Death . 50 , 51. Thomas Hargrove and Matth.ew Martin , were indicted for stealing 3 Guineas , in the Parish of St. Andrew Holborn , the Money of Samuel Davis , in his Dwelling-house , March 4 . Ann Davis . My Husband keeps a Goldsmiths by Holborn-Bridge : On Friday the 4th of March , Thomas Hargrove , or Yorkshire Tom , ( for that 's one of his Names ) and Matthew Martin , the 2 Prisoners came to our Shop to buy a Pair of Buttons , I asked them 20 d. for a Pair ; Hargrove said , I must use him well , for he always came to Mr. Davis when he wanted any Thing in our Way ; so I allow 'd them for 18 d. and he threw down a 36 Shilling Piece to change , I put it into the Till , and took out a Box of Gold , and gave him a Guinea out of the Box , in part of his Change ; then he asked me to let him have a Queen Ann 's Guinea , I looked for one in my Box ( which was full of Gold ) and I found one ; if you have got more of them says he , I should be obliged to you if you 'd let me change them ; but while I was laying down that which I had found , he slapp 'd his Hand into the Box , and took out as many as he could grasp ; then he turn 'd his Hand , as tho ' he would look for the Queen Anne 's Money , and I saw he had as much Gold as cover 'd the Palm of his Hand ; I was surpriz 'd , and would have taken it from him , but he turn 'd his Hand upon the Box again , and gingled some of it in again , keeping his Thumb bent underneath the Palm of his Hand , - and there 's your Money gain , he cry 'd , - pray Madam give me my Change : His Handkerchief lying on the Counter , he took it up with the other Hand , and toss 'd it into the Hand in which he had conceal 'd the Money , and put it into his Pocket . When I recover 'd my self , I said , - hark ' e Sir , - I do n't like your putting your Hand into my Box , - I desire to see what you 've got in that Pocket ; why , says he , d 'ye think I have got your Money ! - search me and welcome , I have above 20 Guineas about me ; I will see , says I , what you have in that Pocket , and I did take Hold of his Coat , and endeavoured to put my Hand into his Pocket , but that Moment he clapp 'd his Hand into it himself , and took out a Piece of rumpled Paper , and gave it to Martin , who stood behind him , and he ( Martin ) whipp 'd it at once into his Coat Pocket , and at the same Instant I heard the Guineas chink as they fell to the Bottom of his Pocket . Why , says I , you 've robb 'd me ! I robb 'd you ! says Yorhshire Tom ( the lusty Fellow there ) - yes , you , said I , - you took my Money , and your Companion has receiv 'd it from you , and immediately I call 'd out - Thieves ! Thieves ! I am robb 'd ! ( for I had no Body in the Shop but my self . ) When I cryed out so loud , they star 'd upon each other , and Yorkshire Tom , and the other Prisoner Martin , threw me down , each of them a Guinea , and said , - there , there 's your Money , but I ran towards the Window and beckon 'd to the People , who were now gather 'd at the Door , and when they came in , I told them , I had got a couple of Thieves . We have a Sash Door to the Shop , and it being Friday and Cattle coming in the Street , the Sash Door was shut , but my Maid hearing me cry out , she came down Stairs and had open 'd the Door . I desired some of the People to call a Constable . - Prisoners Did we endeavour to get away ? Mrs. Davis . No , they did not , - there was a great Croud about the Door , and they could not . - But when the Constable came in , I took them backwards , with several of my Neighbours ; some of them knew Yorkshire Tom , and his Character , and desired me to take care of him . My Husband came Home presently after , and they told him , though they knew nothing of the Affair , yet they would give him 5 or 6 Guineas rather than he should expose them . Q . How much Money did you miss . Mrs. Davis . I ca n't tell exactly how much ; but after the Hurley Burley was over , and I came to recollect my self , I found several Pieces of Gold missing . Q . Were there more Pieces missing than those which they threw down again upon the Counter ? Mrs. Davis Yes several ; but how many I ca n't really say ; and as they were going before the Justice , I believe they shufled the Money from one to another , for they were search 'd before him , and then Martin had none of it , but Hargrove had three Guineas and 9 s. 6 d. in Silver and 2 new Handkerchiefs . Q . You are not sure those three Guineas were yours ? Mrs. Davis . No , I am not sure , but I believe they were as much mine as any one I ever had in my Life . Councel . You ca n't be positive , what Money was in the Box . Mrs. Davis . No ; the Box will hold 30 Guineas . Councel . And can you distinguish by taking two or three Guineas out , whether there has any been taken . Mrs. Davis . Yes ; four Guineas will make a great Vacancy ; for it was a Box that screw 'd , and 't was quite full when I took it out to give them change . Yorkshire Tom . The Box is so small , that I ca n't get my Finger into it . Mrs. Davis . But you put all your Fingers into it . He insisted upon his 36 Shilling-piece , and I said , I have got your Money , and you have got mine . Well says Hargrove , whatever you think you have lost , I will give it rather than be expos 'd . Yorkshire Tom . Ask her if she did not turn my Pocket inside out ? Mrs. Davis . No , my Lord ; I never put my Hand into his dirty Pocket . He had his 36 Shilling piece again before the Justice . Samuel Davis . I had been out about a Quarter of an Hour , when the Fact was committed ; when I came Home , my Spouse declared the whole to me in the same Manner she has now done . I look 'd over my Money , and miss 'd 2 Guineas , beside the 2 Guineas which they had thrown her back . There was about 30 l - in the Box , - 14 Guineas and the rest Portugal Gold . Q . Was all the Portugal Gold there ? Mr. Davis . I am doubtful of that ; but I am sure there were 2 Guineas wanting . When we came before Sir Richard Brocas they were search 'd , and Hargrove had three Guineas and some Silver , but Martin had only 6 d. and a pair of Dice , about him . Martin keeps a sort of a Gaming Table , - a raffling stool . Councel . You say there were both Guineas and Portugal Gold in it ; are you sure there were so many Guineas ? Mr. Davis . Yes ; I inspected the Guineas , but a triffling Time before I went out . The Constable . The 4th of March I was sent for to Mr. Davis 's , and found the 2 Prisoners there . I had a suspicion of them , for I had some Knowledge of Yorkshire Tom . I took charge of them ; and when Mr. Davis came in , says Yorkshire Tom to him , may be you may know better what was in the Box than your Wife , tell it over ; he did so , and said he miss 'd Gold , but did not mention the Sum . When we came before the Justice , Yorkshire Tom told me , I might have made up this matter for them ; I said , I did not understand making up such Things ; why says he if you 'll make it up I 'll give 10 Guineas , and you shall have a handsome Present yourself . Yorkshire Tom . You wanted me to give you 10 Guineas , and you sent for Mr. Taylor the Thief-taker with that Intent , and I said I would not pay any Thing in my Wrong . The Constable . On my Oath , he propos 'd the making up the Affair to me himself Taylor desired me to take Care of him ; for ( he said ) he was a dangerous Fellow with his Knife . Yorkshire Tom , about two Months ago came to my Shop , and would have serv 'd me the very same Trick I suppose , for he wanted some of Queen Anne 's Guineas then too . Councel . That does not relate to this Fact , and it must not be given in Evidence . Hargrove 's Defence . I made a Bargain for the Buttons , and she gave me Change out of a 36 s. Piece , I asked her to give me a Queen Anne 's Guinea , and she did . I desired her to let me have another , and she tender 'd the Money into my Hand , and bid me look my self ; I look 'd it over , and then bid her take her Money again . John Bolton . I have known the Prisoners Seven Years : As to Martin I have dealt with him for some Pounds , and never found but that he was an honest Man . I live in Tottenham-Court Road , and deal in Plate , Martin deals in small Plate likewise . John Bedford . I 'll speak nothing but the Truth ; - I deal in Birds , my Lord , and live at St. Giles 's in the Fields , Martin goes up and down the Country with small Plate . Mr. Davis . My Lord , please to ask , if he does not go up and down with Dice and Totums , a Gaming ? Bedford . I know nothing of his Totum , his general Character is , that of an honest Man . - Green . I was a Labourer a while ago ; but now I am a Victualler in St. Giles 's . Hargrove used to go about the Streets with a Wheel-barrow , what he does now I ca n't tell . C. But his Trade is improved , he does not do so now . Green . Martin used to go under the Name of an honest Man , in the Way of dealing fairly by his Neighbours , and not being given to quarelling . Mr. Davis . Ask him if Hargrove has not been in Newgate before ? Hargrove . Yes , I have been there before , and so have you ; for you have been 2 or 3 Times there to see me . Green . Hargrove has been in Newgate before , but Martin ( I believe , ) never has . John Edwards . Hargrove I know nothing off , I have been in Martin 's Company some few Times , but I know very little of him neither . Joshua Murphey . I deal in Soot , and that very largely , and I live in Newtoner's-Lane . Martin I believe has a pretty good Character , and breeds his Children very behaving . I know no ill of Hargrove ; he never did ill to me : I ca n't say - what I have heard , - I ca n't remember what I have heard , - I ca n't say so much to his Character . Q . Has he a good or a bad Character ? Murphey . I do n't know what to say in the Case . Q . Have you heard any Hurt of him or not ? Murphey . Why , - if I must - speak the Truth , he has been in Newgate before . Ann Edwards . In Cross-Lane I live , by St. Giles 's , and I keep a Chandlers Shop there . Martin lives in the Neighbourhood , and I only know him as a Neighbour - no , no , I have no Conversation with him , but he bears the Character of a civil Man there . Q . Do you know Hargrove ? Edwards . I never was here before , and God bless me , I 'll never come here again . - Yes , I have known him too some Years , - I wo n't forswear my self for any Body , - He used to sell Peas and Cherries , and Fruit about Streets . He was in Newgate once I know , for 'sulting Justice Midford in his Office , - nothing else , as I know of . Both Guilty 39 s . [ Hargrove : Transportation . See summary . ] [ Martin : Branding . See summary . ] 52. Samuel Moreton , was indicted for privately stealing a Silver Watch , value 3 l a Silver Seal , value 10 s. and a Brass ditto , value 2 d. from the Person of John Vaus , March 17 . John Vaus . On the 17th of March , about 7 or 8 in the Evening , I was going to my Habitation , and over-against St. Magnus 's Church upon the Bridge , I was assaulted by the Prisoner ; whether he run his Head against my Breast , or whether he gave me a Blow with his Fist , I can not tell , but he took the Watch out of my Pocket directly . I miss 'd it directly upon the Assault . Q . Did you feel it as it was drawing out ? Vaus . Yes , I did , and I pursu 'd him immediately , and took him : I found nothing upon him , 't is true , but I saw him throw it away . This is the Watch , the Name is Jackson , and the Number 2020 , and here 's the two Knives that were taken out of his Pocket when we searched him . After he had robb 'd me , I pursu 'd him , and he threw me down , and kneel 'd on my private Parts in such a Manner , that I had like to have been ruin 'd ; but this Porter here came to my Assistance , so we carried him to the Constable , and he denied the Fact , and said , I follow 'd another Man . Prisoner . Did not you follow another Person , and take hold of him , before you seiz 'd me ? Vaus . No , I follow 'd him , and took hold of him only . Prisoner . Ask him if he was not much in Liquor ? Vaus . I had not drank so much as a Pint of Beer . Prisoner . He was so much in Liquor , that the Man at the Ale-house , where he carried me , would not let him have any Thing , but told him , he had had too much already . Vaus . The Man of the House did say , he did not desire our Company on such an Occasion . Prisoner . Ask him if he did not offer to make it up for 10 s. Vaus . I never made any such Offer at all : I told him he was a Rogue and a Villain , and I would bring him to Justice . Daniel Cross . That 's my Name : I was going Home to my Family that same Night , and just at the Leather sellers Shop , by Magnus Corner , I saw a Tumult , there was a Parcel of People , and this Gentleman in the middle of them I went to see what was the Matter , and he turn 'd to me and said he had lost his Watch , and away he ran , crying - stop Thief . I am willing to take any Body 's Part that 's injur 'd , and to serve my Country , so , ( tho ' I never saw the Gentleman before in my Life ) I ran with him , he caught hold of the Prisoner , but he was soon upon the Ground , - the Prisoner was too hard for him , he laid him upon his Back in the Street ; but I took him off , and held him by the Collar : Presently up came 2 or 3 Men , who I suppose were the Prisoner 's Companions , but seeing I was a rough sturdy sort of a Fellow , they did not care to have any Thing to say to me . I told the Gentleman 't was a weighty Concern , and asked him if he was positive to the Man ; he said , this is the Man , I 'm sure 't was he , - Q . Was it dark at that Time ? Cross . Yes , but there were Lamps all around us . The Gentleman desired me to get a Constable ; I said I could get a Constable presently , for I was known thereabouts - I carry Coals at Coal-Harbour - so I had them to Mr. Tricket 's at the 3 Tunns in Thames street , and we had not been long there , but in comes this young Man with the Watch in his Hand ; - here , Sir , says he , I heard you have lost a Watch , and I make bold to bring it you , I kick 'd it before me in the Street ; but the Gentleman did not believe him , so he charg 'd the Constable with him and the Prisoner too . Q . Why did you charge the Constable with the Lad , that brought you the Watch ? ( to Vaus . ) Vaus . Because I thought he was concern 'd with the Prisoner . Q . Did the Prosecutor appear to be positive to the Prisoner , before the Lad came in ? Cross . Yes ; he was positive to him ; I took him off from the Gentleman upon the Ground , and would have tripp 'd up my Heels too , and would have got away , but I was too many for him . Prisoner . Ask him if I struggled with him ? Cross . Yes ; and I had 2 or 3 about me like your self ; they seemed to be much as honest Men . James Price , I was coming over the Bridge , and I happen 'd to pick this Watch up , about half an Hour after 7 o'clock at Night ; T'was some Time in March , but I ca n't justly tell the Day . I place 'd it up right against St. Magnus Church , and carried it , the Case in one Hand , and the Watch in the other , to the Prosecutor . Prisoner . Ask him whether the Watch and Case was together or seperate ? Price . I found the Case first , and the Watch afterwards ; I trod upon it , and my Shoes happening to be bad at that Time , it hurt my Foot , so I stoop 'd down to see what it was , and 2 Lads seeing me pick it up , told me a Gentleman had just lost a Watch , so I carried it to him directly . Prisoner . Did not the Prosecutor offer to make it up , as I was going to the Counter ? Price . No ; I ca n't say any such Thing . Q . It appears it was dark or duskish ; by what Light did you distinguish the Prisoner ? Vaus . I distinguish 'd him directly ; I follow 'd and pursu 'd him by the Light of the Day ( I might say ) for 't was not shut in , though the Lamps were li't ; I saw him by the Lamps too , and am sure of the Person . Defence . I had been over the Bridge that Night , and coming along , I saw the Gentleman push a Man away from him , and heard him say he had lost his Watch . I went into the Crowd and asked him what was the Matter ; he immediately turn 'd about and ran after a Man , and caught hold of him , but the Fellow got away from him , and then , because he would be sure of somebody he laid hold of me . He was very much in Liquor , so he tumbled down , and pull 'd me down with him , then this Porter came up and laid hold of me . 'T is a very plausible Thing indeed , that the Watch should be thrown away , and the Glass should not be broke . Guilty Death . 53. Richard Harper , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of William Holyoke , in the Parish of St . Brides , about 3 in the Night , and stealing 250 Guineas , one five Moidore Piece , one five Guinea-Piece , April 18 . William Holyoke . On Monday Morning April 18 , I got up about 7 o'Clock ; and my Servant going down into the Cellar for a penn'orth of Beer , came up again and said , Sir , I believe you 're been robb 'd to-night , for one of the Barrs of the Cellar Window was wrenched . I hope not , says I , and look 'd about and saw the Brass and Pewter safe ; then I went to the Smith 's to get the Bar mended . When I came back again , my Wife was just come down Stairs , and my Child cry 'd out at the Top of the Stair , - Mammy ! - Mammy , somebody has run away with the Money Box : I knew the Box was in the Room and stood where it always did ; but hearing the Child call out , I ran up Stair . and the Box was gone indeed . Upon this I went immediately to Alderman Child 's , and when I return 'd Home , my Neighbours met me in the Court , and told me the Box was found . There were 250 Guineas , a five Guinea-Piece , and a five Moidore piece in it , and when 't was found , there had nothing been taken out ; all the Money was in it . Q . How old is the Child that cry 'd out - the Box was gone ? Holyoke . About 12 or 13 Years old . Q . When the Bars of the Window were broke , was there Room for the Prisoner to get in ? Holyoke . There are four Bars in the Window ; one was bent , and the other was push 'd out of its Place , so that there was Room enough for him to get in . Q . Are you sure the Window was whole and safe when you went to Bed ? Holyoke . It might be so ; but indeed I ca n't speak to that , of my own Knowledge . Thomas Bullock . Last Monday Morning about 8 o'Clock , I was going into the Prosecutor 's House , and I saw his Daughter crying in the Entry ; I asked what was the Matter , and Mrs. Holyoke told me , she was robb 'd , and ruin 'd , for somebody had stole all her Money , & c Mr. Holyoke was gone out somewhere - so while we were talking , the Man and the Maid call 'd out from above Stairs , and said they had found the Box in the Club room , in a Closet : I saw the Lad bring it down Stairs , ty 'd up in a Handkerchief . Then he and I , and another went up into the Garret , to see if we could perceive any way , by which the Thief might have escap 'd ; we look 'd about and could perceive nothing . We look 'd up the Garret Chimneys , but nobody was there . As we were coming down Stairs , the Maid cry 'd out Thieves ! Thieves ! so we went into that Room , and took the Prisoner out of the Chimney . I saw him pull 'd down , and I spake to him , and ask 'd him how he got in , and what Time it was ; he said he got in at the Cellar Window , about 3 o'Clock . Q . Did he say any Thing to you about the Box ? Bullock . No , nothing to me ; at that Time . When he was at the Bull-Head in Bread-Street , I asked him what Instruments he made Use of , to get out the Iron Bar ; he said , he had nothing but his Hands , - he got it out with his Hands , and then went into the Cellar . He own 'd before the Lord-Mayor that he took the Box , and ty 'd it up in his Handkerchief ; be own 'd he took it out of the Chamber , and brought it down into the Club-Room . That 's all I have to say Richard Googe . I live in Water-Lane , Fleet-Street . Hearing Mr. Holyoke was robb 'd , I went to his House to enquire into the Particulars . They told me they had been robb 'd , so the Maid and I went up to see if the Thief was not in the House , she look 'd up the Chimney , and cry 'd out , - here he is in the Chimney . I saw the Soot fall , so I made her get a Candle , then I saw him too , so I got up upon the Grates , and pull 'd him down by the Leg , in a Sooty Condition I am sure 't was the Prisoner , for I have , known him these two Years . Q . Did you hear him confess any Thing ? Googe . No , I know nothing of his Confession . Prisoner . I came down my self , for they said , if I would not come down , they 'd shoot me down . John Hill . When I came down in the Morning , I found one of the Bars of the Cellar Window wrench 'd out , and two more bent ; I shut up the Cellar the Night before between 6 and 7 o ' Clock , and I was sure the Bars were all fast then , so I told my Master ( as how ) he had been robb 'd : No , says he , I hope not , and he looked round the Kitchen , and there was nothing missing there , - all was safe . Then he went to the Smith 's to bid him come and mend the Window : While he was gone there , my Mistress came down Stairs , and my Master came back in a Minute ; he was no sooner come in , but the Child above Stairs call 'd out , Mammy ! Mammy ! some body has taken away the Money Box ! With that , my Master run up Stairs , and saw the Box was gone ; he came down again , and said , ( as how ) be was ruin 'd , he was ruin 'd , the Box was gone ! Then he went out , and while he was gone , I found the Box in a Closet near the Chimney , in the Club-Room , ty 'd up in a Handkerchief . I went down and shew 'd it my Mistress , to make her easy , and then I carry 'd it up to the Place it was taken from . I did not see the Prisoner 'till after he was pull 'd out of the Chimney . Tho . Humstone Holyoke 's Servant telling me that Morning that his Master had been robb 'd , I went there directly ; Mr. Bullock and I went all over the House , and look 'd out of the Garret Windows , but there was was no Track of Footsteps to be seen , not were any Tiles broke . I should have told you before , that we went to the Cellar Window , and saw a Bar taken out , and another so bent , that there was Room for a middling Man to get thro ' . Then we look 'd up the Chimnies , and I call 'd for a Link or a Candle that we might search them more narrowly ; and in the Club-Room Chimney the Maid found him , and cry 'd out Thieves ; I said , pull him down , but the Prisoner was not very willing to come down , but at last , - down he came , and in a sad smutty Condition he was . Ah , Dick ! says I , is it you ! I examin 'd him whether he had any Confederates , No , says he , 't was my own Act and Deed . Why , what Time did you get in , says I , I got in , says he , thro ' the Cellar Window , about 3 o'Clock this Morning , and wrenched one of the Bars out with my Hands . Defence . I had been drinking from Friday to Monday , ( being out of Place ) and was almost dead for want of Sleep ; so the Bar being loose , I put it by , and went into the House , and so up Stairs to sleep As to the Box I know nothing at all of it . Guilty . Death . 54 . * Mary Brown , was indicted for stealing 9 Yards of White and Silver Lustring , value 6 l. and 9 Yards of Green and Silver ditto , value 6 l. the Goods of Thomas Hinchliffe in his Shop , in the Parish of St. Bride 's , April 7 . * The Prisoner was indicted and sentenced for Transportation by the Name of Mary White , in February Sessions , 1736 , for robbing Mr.Davis 's Shop in Cheapside . See Sessions Book , p. 75 . Spencer Morris . This Woman and another , and a Man came into our Shop , to look at some brown ground Brocades ; they bid Money for some Silks , which I could not take , so they went out again . I had shew 'd them the Goods in the third Shop , ( that was the back Shop , the farthest from the Door , ) where these Goods which the Prisoner stole , lay wrapt up in a Wrapper , with 14 Pieces more , - Q . What do you call them ? Mr. Morris Silver Lurstrings . - They were no sooner out of the Door , but a Person beckon 'd me out , and bid me take Care of them , for they were all Thieves and Gamblers . Upon this , I call 'd the Prisoner back again into the Shop , the Fellow came with her , but the other Woman walk 'd off : I thought proper to tell Mr. Hinchliffe what I had heard , and while I was telling him , the Man went off , and left the Prisoner alone in the Shop . These 2 Pieces of Silk I saw directly under her Petticoats , and she stood directly over them ; she had been in the Street , and was come into the Shop again . I took them from under her , and asked her how she came by them ? She ask 'd my Pardon , and said , she hop 'd she had not daub 'd them . O , they were pretty Things , ( she said ) pray , what were they a Yard ! Q . Was there no one else in the Shop when you took the Silks off the Ground ? Mr. Morris . No , the Man that came back with her was gone before we found them , and the other Woman did not come back at all . Q . Did you see her drop them ? Mr. Morris . No , I ca n't say I saw her drop them , but they were taken from under her Petticoats , - she stood over them . Prisoner Did not I stoop and take up one of the Pieces , and lay it on the Counter ? Was not I the first Person that saw them on the Ground . Mr. Morris . No , I took them up my self ; she never offer 'd to take them up , - she stood exactly over them . Charles Enstone . The Prisoner , with another Woman and a Man , came in , and desired to see some Brown-ground Silks : I carried them into the back Shop , where the Counter was quite clear , only 16 Pieces of these Silks were laid together behind the Counter , wrapt up in a Wrapper . I went into another Shop to look for more Things for them , and they bid me Money , but we could not agree , so they walk 'd thro ' the Shop to the Door , and while I was talking to the Prisoner at the Door , a Man desired Mr. Morris to take Care of them : upon this Notice , I call 'd her into the Shop again , and told her I did not know but I might take her Money . They had been ( all of them ) out of the Shop , and I desired her to come in , and look at the Silks once more ; she came back , and while she was looking at them again , Mr. Morris stoop 'd down and took up her Petticoats ( a little way ) and these Pieces of Silk he pull 'd from under them . He asked me if I had shewn them to her , I said no . ( They lay in the Back Shop , wrapp 'd up in a wrapper . ) I hope , says she , that I have not dirted them : Upon this , I told over the Pieces in the wrapper and found these two wanting . These 16 Pieces were wrapp 'd up and laid behind the Counter in the Back Shop , and were never shewn to them , nor had they been shewn to any one for a Fortnight , for they were laid by for a particular Purpose , and we were order 'd not to meddle with them , nor shew them to any one . Q . How long before this Time , had you seen them in the Wrapper ? Mr. Eustone . I put them in my self about a Fortnight before , and we had positive Orders not to meddle with them . They were not out of the Wrapper , nor were any Goods upon the Counter , but what I had shew 'd them . Q . Did you leave them together in the Shop ? Mr. Enstone . I went into another Shop to fetch the Goods which they wanted to see . Q . You say these Silks lay behind the Counter , did you observe , any of them go near the Wrapper . Mr. Enstone . No ; but they could not get at them without going behind the Counter . Q . ( To Mr. Morris ) Did you see any of them go behind the Counter . Mr. Morris . No . Mr. Enstone . I was out of the Shop , and they were left entirely alone for some Time . The Prisoner , my Lord , was cast for Transportation about a Twelvemonth ago ; the Gentleman is in Court for robbing of whom , she should have been transported . Prisoner 's Defence . My Lord ; last Wednesday was a Fortnight , a Gentlewoman that I have work 'd for 5 Years , - her Brother came and desired me to go with him and the other Gentlewoman , to buy a Gown for his Sister , that I might give my Judgement on the Silks ; so one of the Shops we went into , was this Gentleman 's , and after we had pitch 'd upon a Piece , he asked us 16 Shillings a Yard , we bid him 12 , and the Gentleman that was with us bid him 12 s. 6 d and my Lord , he pulled out his Purse and offer 'd to pay for it , if he would have taken the Money ; but he refusing , we went out . Then a lusty Gentleman in the Shop , call 'd us back again to look at the Flower , and as I came in , I saw these two Pieces lye upon the Ground , and I stooped down and took them up , and the Gentleman stooped down too . Q . ( To the Prisoner ) Where is the Man and the Woman that were with you ? Prisoner . The Gentlewoman , - she lives at the Downs , and the Gentleman - he 's in the Country . Mr. Enstone . My Lord , she told me her self , that the Man liv 'd in Morefields , and the Woman in Drury-Lane . Jury Q . When they went out of the Shop into the Street , was there any Silks upon the Ground . Mr. Enstone . No , I should have seen them if there had been any , for I stood talking to them before they went out in the Place where they were dropp 'd . Q . How far was the Place where they lay , from the Place where they were dropp 'd ? Mr. Enstone . About 22 Yards ; I measur 'd it this Day . Prisoner . Had I any Thing about me proper to conceal these Things ? Mr. Enstone . She had a very large Hoop ; I told her she look 'd big , and she said she was with Child . Joseph Barker . I have known her between 4 and 5 Months ; she lodges at Mrs. Fenns , in Castle-Street ; about three Months ago she made a Stay for a Child of mine , and 3 Shirts and a Stock for me , and she brought these things Home . Jane Brown . I have known her about a Year and half , she made a Gown for me within these three Months and three frocks . Q . When did you see her before she made your Gown ? Brown . When she made my Gown , I had not seen her for 4 Months together . Michael Brownrigg . I am a Barber , and have seen the Gentlewoman - the Prisoner , at Mrs. Fenns : I have known her 2 or 3 Years , and have seen her frequently , during that Time . I never heard ill of her till now . Q . Has not she been abroad - in the Country - during this Time ? Brownrigg . She may - for ought I know . Ann Fenn . I keep an Alehouse in Castle street . I have known the Gentlewoman 2 Years - a very honest Gentlewoman , she is - in her Dealings . I never heard any Thing to her Character before . Mary Lambert . My Lord , I knew her a twelve-month , and as any Mantua-maker 's equal to me , I gan her a Gown , 't was this said Gown to do , at Mrs. Fenns , I had no Acquaintance with her farther ; but she bore an honest Character . Mr. William Davis . The Prisoner at the Bar , I Transported for Shoplifting . She robb 'd me , last February was twelve-month , and was convicted and sentenced for Transportation ; but I see she is return 'd ; She is known to have been a Shoplifter many Years . Guilty Death . 55. John Irons , otherwise Thompson , was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. dut devising and intending , our Lord to deceive and defraud , on the 22d of February , 40 Pieces of false and counterfeit Money , of base Metal , in the Likeness of the lawful and current Money of this Realm , called Shillings , and 10 Pieces , & c. to the Likeness of Six-pences , did feloniously and traiterously forge and counterfeit Samuel Goodyere . I have known the Prisoner , I believe a dozen Years . He once kept a Cook 's Shop , then he went beyond Sea , and about the latter end of October , or the beginning of November , he return 'd to England , and I came over with him in the same Ship . When we first arriv 'd here , we got a Lodging at Mrs. Worral 's in Swallow-street ; while we liv 'd there , we us 'd to get King Charles 's Farthings , and file the Woman side , and the Edges to make them of the size and thickness of a Six-pence ; then we used to white them over with quicksilver taken from the back of a Looking-glass , and sometimes we put them into an Onyon , then we used to bend them and pass them off . This Practice we continued a Month , if not longer ; but we had bad Luck in putting them off : Some we disposed of to Apple-Women , and People in the Street : But one Day when we were out upon this Business , I thought an opportunity offer 'd for putting some of them off , and I bid the Prisoner give me some ; ( for he always carried them in his Pocket , and I generally put them off , ) he felt in his Pocket , and said he had left them at Home ; so return 'd Home for them . While we were out , our Landlady Mrs. Worral had been up in our Room to clean it , and she found the Paper they were in upon the Table with some Quicksilver in it ; she gave it him , when we came Home , but told us we should be there no more . Then we went and liv 'd in a Place by Long-Acre , ( I have forgot the Name ) over-against a Brewhouse , and there he told me he had learn 'd of a Woman in Virginia , ( whose Mother was burnt here for Coining ) how to make Shillings and Six-pences , and Half-Crowns . This Womans Name was Knight , she had instructed him in the Art of making Money , he said : So he went to his Brother-in-law Powl in Brick-lane , and got a Mold made , - thus long , and thus wide . The inside of the Mold was square and hollow , which he fill 'd up with Chalk , finely scraped , then he made the Impression of a Shilling , and cast one ; the first did not do well ; the 2d , was better , so he made several Shillings , and the more he made , the better they prov 'd . The Metal was always melted in a Tobacco-Pipe , and pour 'd into the Mold . ( If I had the Things here I could show you how we made them . ) When the Pieces were taken out of the Molds , he pared off the Metal that ran from the Edges , and then nick 'd them with a clean Tile , to make the Milling ; then he used to scower them with Sand to make them look bright , and the last Thing was to put them into a Pot of Water and boil them with a Powder call 'd Argol , to make them look white and like Silver . Some were in the Form of South Sea Shillings , other with the Feathers and the Roses on the Backs . Q . Did the Prisoner do this ? Goodyere . Yes ; and 't was my Business to put them off ; that 's some of the Metal that lies there ; they call it Soder ; we bought it at the Pewterers , and gave 10 d. a Pound for it . Mr. Watson . This Samuel Goodyere came to my House to buy a Sheep 's Tongue , and he gave me this very Shilling to change for it . I am sure I had it of Goodyere . Goodyere . 'T is true , I remember paying this to Mr. Watson , but I had this Shilling from one Davis , who is not taken . Q . Was that Shilling made by the Prisoner ? Goodyere . 'T is one of the same Sort that the Prisoner used to make and deliver to me . I have had a great many of them from him , - a great many more than 20 . - I can very well swear to 20 . I ca n't swear to Sixpences made in this Manner , but I can swear to copper Sixpences . Councel . Did you put them off . Goodyere . Yes , Sir . Councel . And were those 20 Shillings you swear to , made in the Manner you have mention 'd ? Goodyere . I ca n't swear they were made of the same sort of Metal with this Shilling , but they were made of such Soder as that which lies in Court . Francis Mitchell . I found this Piece of Soder in a House which the Prisoner at the Bar calls his ; 't was in a Closet lock 'd up . When I took up the Prisoner , he asked me , if I had been at his House ; I told him , Yes , and that I had found a Piece of Metal and some Argol ; he said he us 'd them in his Business . Q . Was the Closet where you found the Things , joining to the Lodging-Room ? Mitchell . Yes . He calls all the House his , I thought it had been an empty House , but when we forced the Door open , we found a Soldier in it , who said he had Leave to come there to wash his Shirt . When we had the Prisoner before Justice Frazier , he own 'd the Metal was there , but he said he never knew how to make Money . Q . Did he own the Argol ? Mitchell . I am not positive whether that was mention 'd to him or not . Prisoner . Did you find any thing else ? Mitchel . No . The Files were found in Border 's Lodging . Mrs. Worral . The Prisoner Lodged with me about a Month , and Goodyere was with him : Whenever they went out , I made them leave the Key of the Room , that I might see if my Sheets and Things were there . One Day when they were out , I went up into the Room , and found a Paper twisted up , upon the Table ; I brought it down Stairs and look 'd into it ; there were 10 Six-pences in it , some Mill 'd , and some not Mill 'd , they had all-of them Heads on one Side , and some of them had Cross-Bars on the other ; the Prisoner came back and asked me if I had been in the Room ; yes says I , and I have brought 10 pieces down , I have told them , and see that you have them all again ; to-morrow your Week will be up , and you must provide your selves with another Lodging . I had heard them at Work , and a Fileing , and seeing these Pieces , made me resolve they should not stay . Goodyere and he liv 'd together in Friendship then , and said they were Buckle-makers . Q . Have you ever seen any Files there ? Worral . Yes , and small Dust , small Fileings too , which I did not know what to make of . Q . Did you ever see any Powder there ? Worral . Yes , the Six pences lay in a Paper of Powder , I believe 't was much such Stuff as this ( here a Paper of Argol was shewn her ) it look 'd like rotten Stone , Powder 'd . Prisoner . Do you know those Pieces in the Paper were Naught ? Worral . They did not found so well as others , but a crooked Six pence will not found so well as another . Councel . You said you thought they were not Good , and that was the Reason you gave them Warning . Do you think it was good Money or Bad ? Worral . I can not say it was right Good . Prisoner . Did you ever see any Metal or Molds ? Worral . No . Prisoner . No ; I do n't know how you should ; for I never Coin 'd a Shilling , or a Six-pence in my Life . Worral . I believe they did not Coin in my House , for they never had but half a Peck of Coals at a Time , and they generally served them a Week . Councel . You ca n't tell what they did at their Fire , always . Prisoner . Was there any Lock , to Lock any thing up ? Worral . No ; and I had always the Key of the Door when they went out . Goodyere . The Money and Things we always put up on the Tester of the Bed , when we went out . The Money , the Files , and the Quicksilver we always hid there . Mr. North . This Powder is call 'd Argol , 't is used in whitening Plate . The counterfeit Money as it came out of the Molds , would be a little dirty , but boiling it with this , it takes of all the Soil , and makes it look white . This Shilling is a counterfeit Shilling , and was never Coin 'd at the Tower , 't is made of Pewter , I believe . Defence . I left Goodyere once ( when I was abroad ) to look after the House , and while I was gone , I heard he had had one Davis with him , ( the Man he had that Shilling from , ) but he was not there when I came Home . Goodyere can not tell one Place where he put off a bad Shilling , but only this One . Goodyere . I put off one that you made , at an Oylshop in Maiden-lane , and to several Apple People and Ginger-bread Women , and such Folks . Prisoner . I desire to know if he ever saw me use any of that sort of Metal . Goodyere . Yes ; I have seen him use that sort of Metal to make the Money , and then he put it into an earthen pot , with some of that Argol and boil it over the Fire . Prisoner . Since I have been in the Gatehouse , a Man bid me hold my Tongue about that Block Tin , 'till I heard what the Evidence should say ; then says he , tell my Lord , that , that Metal when 't is Melted will not hold together , but will run all in little Pieces , - little Lumps ; there 's no such Thing as Casting any Thing with it . Mr. North . I am not enough acquainted with that sort of Metal , to know whether 'twill hold together or not : I believe 't is proper to use some other sort with it , by way of Alloy . Q . Do you think the Impression on that Shilling was made by Casting or Stamping ? Mr. North . This is Cast ; tho ' they scrape the Chalk ever so fine , yet there will be Sand-holes in the Piece they Cast ; if it had been struck with a Dye , the Metal would have been a great deal closer . Q . Did you make use of any other Metal with this Soder by Way of Alloy ? ( To Goodyere . ) Goodyere . Yes , sometimes we melted Pewter Spoons with it , - those mark 'd with X , because they were the best sort ; sometimes we made them without Pewter , and sometimes with . Councel . Did you use to buy Pewter Spoons ? Goodyere . No , they were the Pewter Spoons that we had in our Lodging , or the Spoons we used to make . Councel . Make ! why , did you use to steal them ? Goodyere . Yes . Prisoner . I got that Sodor to mend a Mould which I bought to make Candles in ; and the Metal lay about the Kitchen a Fortnight or 3 Weeks , - I did not mind it . Q . Did the Prisoner get this Metal to mend his Moulds , or to make Money ? ( To Goodyere ) Goodyere . To make Money , his Moulds wanted no mending , and he was too lazy to make Candles . Prisoner . Lord have Mercy upon me ! did you ever see such Metal in my House , Samuel Goodyere ! Goodyere . Yes , and you us 'd to give 10 d a Pound for it . Spencer Burges . I am a Tin-man , and I use that metal in my Business . I know 't is brittle , but I believe it will hold together to make a Shilling or a Six-pence ; 10 d. also is the common Price . I give so much for it my self . Acquitted . 56. Thomas Killcup , was indicted for stealing 18 lb . of Leaden Pipe , value 18d . fixed to the Dwelling House of John Ayres , March 1 . Guilty . 57.

James Kelly , was indicted for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. at Ranuce in Newfoundland , in Parts beyond the Seas , on Robert Levermore , did make an Assault , and with both his Hands fixed about the Neck of the said Levermore , did choak and strangle , of which choaking and strangling he died , Feb. 18. in the 8th Year of his Majesty 's Reign . The Councel for the King having open 'd the Indictment and the Evidence , the Witnesses were call 'd and sworn . Nicholas Fitzgerald . I came acquainted with the Prisoner in the Harbour of Ranuce in Newfoundland , and likewise with one William Fitzgerald , at the same place , who was no Relation of mine , tho ' we were of the same Name . I know nothing with relation to this Murder , but what the Prisoner told me himself . The Deceased was found after he had been kill 'd , upon the Landwash , and the Day he was to be buried , William Fitzgerald desired me to go to Formuze , ( where the Prisoner was at that Time ) and I was to tell him , that Levermore ( the Deceased ) was found , and all the Harbour ( according to the Custom of that Place ) was summon 'd to lay their Hands upon the Corps , before he was buried , in Order to find out the Murderer . When I came to the Prisoner , he asked me what the Gentlemen and the Doctor imagin 'd had been the Cause of his Death : I told him , the Doctor supposed the Man had been shot ; no , says he , he is mistaken , for Fitzgerald and I went to his House , and call 'd for a Bottle of Rum ; we paid a Shilling ready Money for it , and made him drink the greatest Part of it himself ; when we found him almost fuddled , Fitzgerald and I caught hold of him and strangled him , he had ( says he ) not a squeak for his Life ; then , ( he said ) they lock 'd him up 'till Night , and then carried him to the Stage-Head , and threw him into the Sea . Q . Did Kelly go with you to touch the Corps of the Deceased ? Fitzgerald . No , he took to the Woods with Fitzgerald . Q . When was the Prisoner taken ? Fitzgerald . Nine or ten Days afterwards - Fitzgerald was kill 'd in the Woods , but I was not present when he was kill 'd . Councel . You say the Prisoner confess 'd to you , that they had Strangled him , and had not given him a squeak for his Life . Fitzgerald . Yes . Councel . How came he to confess this to you ? How long had you and he been acquainted ? Fitzgerald . I had been acquainted with him , about 2 Months . Q . Why his telling you this , was the ready way for him to be taken up . Fitzgerald . I do n't know how he came to tell me ; I asked him no Questions about it ; every one in the Harbour was Summon 'd to lay their Hands on the Corps , and they that did not come , he knew would be suspected . Councel . Was you intimate with Fitzgerald ? Fitzgerald . He and I were Fellow-Servants . Q . How long have you been in England ? Fitzgerald . I have been here ever since the 9th of February ; I came over in the same Ship with the Prisoner . Robert Joyce . I know the Prisoner ; and I knew the Deceased . The Night that he went from Ranuce , I heard the Prisoner say he had kill 'd Levermore . He and William Fitzgerald , ( who was kill 'd in the Woods ) and this Fitzgerald , ( the Witness ) were in the Skiff ; the Wind blue so hard that they could not get any farther , so they call 'd upon me at a Place call 'd Sheeps-Head , about 12 o'Clock at Night ; this was the Night after the Man was Kill 'd . I was a Bed , but I got up and lot the Prisoner in , and he lay at my House all Night . Next Morning he desir 'd me to go down for the Skiff ; I went , and found in it a bottle of Gun-powder , a Musket , a pair of Breeches and 2 Handkerchiefs . I asked him where he got those Things ? He told me , he had them of a Woman in Ranuce Harbour . I said , I was sure that Woman had not any such Things as these : Why then says he , I had them out of Levermore 's House ; William Fitzgerald and I went there , and call 'd for a Bottle of Rum ; we pay 'd ready Money for it , and made Levermore Drink with us : I ask 'd him how he got the Things from thence , and he told me , that while they were Drinking together , 2 Men came in to fry some Pancakes , ( Stevens , the Father and Son ) that when these Men were gone out of the House , Fitzgerald said to him , let us-kill Levermore now : The Prisoner told me , that he refus 'd , and said , No , no , let him alone for a Fortnight , or a Month longer , for fear the Stevens 's should discover us ; but Fitzgerald swore by G - d he should be kill 'd then ; so ( he said ) they both took hold of him , and strangled him directly . All this the Prisoner told me , and he said farther , that when Levermore was dead , he ( the Prisoner ) was left in the Room with him , while Fitzgerald went up and took all he could find , and Fitzgerald ( he said ) had not done him Justice , for he had conceal 'd some of the Things ; he told me , that at Night the carried the Body to the Stage Head , and hove him into the Sea . When the Corps was found , every Body was Summon 'd to put their Hands upon it , but the Prisoner and Fitzgerald went off , into the Woods . Q . How long were they in the Woods before they were taken ? Joyce . A matter of 6 Weeks . Q . What became of Fitzgerald ? Joyce . He was kill 'd in the Woods ; they fled there after this Man 's Death . Q . Was you there when the People were Summon 'd to touch the Body ? Joyce . Yes , and I touch 'd it . We heard of Levermore 's being Kill 'd about 4 Days after they were gone into the Woods , and it was no sooner known , but the Prisoner went a matter of an hundred Leagues to the North-ward , and about 6 Weeks afterwards he was taken . Q . How came William Fitzgerald to be in the Skiff when the Prisoner went from Ranuce ? Joyce . I do n't know Q . Was the other Fitzgerald ( the Witness ) in the Skiff ? Joyce . Yes . Q . What was your Notion concerning touching the dead Body ? Joyce . We all imagin 'd that if the Murderer touch 'd it , it would Bleed . Q . ( To Fitzgerald ) The Night after this happen 'd , did you come in the Boat with the Prisoner ? - Did you go any where with him in the Boat ? Fitzgerald . Yes , I came from Captain King-men 's Stage , and the Wind blew so hard , we could not bring the Boat up : I did not know any Thing of the Murder at that Time . I saw the Things in the Boat before they desired me to go with them , but I did not know they were Levermore 's . Q . What was you to do in the Boat with them ? Fitzgerald . To go Home along with them , and we went from Ranuce to the Harbour of Formuze , to a Place call 'd the Sheep's-Head , where the Prisoner liv 'd . He had the Charge of one Lambe 's Stores , and work 'd on his Account . Q . When you went with them in the Boat , did you know of Levermore 's being dead ? Fitzgerald . I heard he was kill 'd , but did not know by who . Q . How far was Ranuce from the Place where they brought the Boat too ? Fitzgerald . About 3 Miles . The Prisoner wanted me to row from Capt . Kingman's-Stage to the Sheep's-Head , but the Wind blew so hard , we could not row up to the Place , so we were forced to travel a good Way by Land , and the Prisoner had the Breeches and the Shirt , and the other Things , which he told me he had from Levermore 's ty 'd upon a Bundle at his Back .

Councel . And was Fitzgerald ( who fled with you ) afraid she should swear against him too ? Prisoner . No , I do n't know how he came to go with me .

Eliz . Pate . I was robb 'd in Tottenham-Court Fair Time ; 't was one of the two last Days of the Fair , - the latter End of August it was , but I could never tell the Day of the Month , only I remember 't was the latter End of August . I was then coming from the Fair , - my Sister and some other Company were with me , but I stay 'd a little longer than ordinary to see the Clock-work , so my Company was just gone before me , - I staid a little behind them too , to tye up my Garter . - Morgan , not this Man ( the Prisoner ) came up to me first ; he had a Dagger , and he led me to the Prisoner , and he had a Pistol ; - there were 3 of them in all , and the third Man had a Pistol too . The Prisoner and the other , had seiz 'd a young Man , so he and I were robb 'd by them . The Prisoner held his Pistol to my Breast , and it snapp 'd twice , but did not go off , I down 'd on my Knees , and begg 'd for Christ 's Sake they would spare my Life ; then they carry 'd me over a high Bank towards the Brill , I begg 'd for Christ Jesus Sake they would have Mercy on me , I told them I was with Child , and begg 'd for Mercy for the Infant 's Sake within me . I was not with Child , but I did tell them so indeed , that they might be favourable : The Prisoner said , my Life should be safe . - Q . Did the other Man who was robb 'd go with you to this Place , or did you go alone ? Pate . Two of them carry 'd the Man a little Distance from me , and after they had stripp 'd him , they came up to me , and made me strip my self , all but my Hat , Cap and Shoes , - those they pull 'd off themselves . The Prisoner assisted in making me strip , and he took my Cloaths as they were taken off . I lost a Holland sprig 'd Gown , a Pair of Stays , a quilted Coat , and a Pair of Shoes , they left me one Petticoat on and my Shift , but they did not know it . They left likewise my Stockings and a Petticoat which I had mended up , to wear under another . Then they put a Gag in my Mouth , ( and broke this Tooth out , ) and they tore my Pocket , and put that into my Mouth too , and ty 'd it down hard behind : The Gag was Iron or Steel , and it cut my Mouth , but I got it away with my Tongue , after I was in the Ditch , so that I could cry out . I lost this Tooth by it , - it did not come out just then , but it cut and rotted it so , that it came out afterwards . Q . After they had ty 'd your Pocket over your Mouth , what did they do then ? Pate . After Morgan had done what he thought proper with me , then the Prisoner try 'd for an Hour , but could not have his Ends , he did not lie with me , but Morgan did , and the Prisoner endeavoured to do it . Morgan did more than the Prisoner did ; he attempted it first , and then the Prisoner attempted after him ; he ( the Prisoner ) lay a-top of me , but he did not lie with me : They kept me rather more than 3 Hours , and after they had done all that they thought proper , they took hold of my Hand and said , - come along . I was very much afraid of my Life , and said , Dear Sir , I will come along , but Dear Sir , spare my Life : So they carry 'd me to the Man they had stripp 'd stark naked . Q . During the Time they were abusing you , was the Gag in your Mouth ? Pate . No , they did not put that into my Mouth , till they bound me to the Man . Q . In what manner did they bind you ? Pate . They ty 'd my Hands to his Hands , and my Legs to his Legs ; - they ty 'd us Back to Back : I had my Flanel Coat and my Shift on , but they did not know they had left me my Shift , for they had bid me pull it off , and I was pulling it off , but I do n't know how it happen 'd - God Almighty would not have it so . Q . Was the other Man gag 'd too ? Pate . No , nor did they bind him so hard as they did me : they put a Piece of my Pocket into his Mouth , but he could cry out , and I could not . Q . When they had done this , what then ? Pate . They push 'd us both into the Ditch , and the Man that was bound with me lay above me , I lay with my Face on the Bank , and that sav 'd me . 'T is not a Ditch that 's always full of Water , but 't is a Drain that comes from the Brill . I was undermost in the Water , and if my Head had not come on the Bank , I must have been smother 'd . I lay in this Condition from half an Hour after 12 , till about 5 in the Morning . Q . Are you sure the Prisoner at the Bar was one of them ? Pate . Yes , I have great Knowledge to be assur 'd ; it was very light when they took hold of me , and it was light again before they had done with me . I saw them by Means of the Light of the Heavens , - 't was Moon-light : - I have great Knowledge of the Prisoner . Q . Was the Moon up before they had done with you ? Pate . I believe it was the Moon , but it did not shine out bright ; - the Moment I was taken out of the Ditch , I said I knew the Men . Q . When you and the Man lay in the Ditch , did either of you make any Noise ? Pate . The Man did , but I could not , 'till about 2 o'Clock , then I got the Gag a little on one Side of my Month . Q . You was saying you knew him when you saw him ; when was it you did see him afterwards ? Pate . The Prisoner was taken up on Account of a Quarrel , and I having describ 'd the Prisoner so well , the Person that took him up thought he was the Man , so he sent for me , and I - Q . Who was it sent for you ? Pate . Mr. Barnes ; and as soon as I saw him , I was ready to sink , and said if there 's a God Almighty in Heaven , that was the Man that held a Pistol to my Breast The People bid me be sure , and I said , I could not be surer , than I was in my own Heart . I had been shew 'd an hundred Thieves , but I never fix 'd on any but the Prisoner . Prisoner . This is all for the sake of the Reward . Q . Had he such Hair on , as he has now ? Pate . I ca n't say whether he had a Wig or his own Hair , but I am sure he 's the Man . William Smith . I was going to work between 4 and 5 in the Morning in the Time of Tottenham-Court Fair , 't was one of the last two Days , and I heard somebody cry , - Murder : I went to the Place from whence the Noise came , and I found a Man and this Woman ty 'd together ; the Man had never a Rag upon him ; - the Woman had a Smock , a Flannel Coat , and her Stockings on , but she was so cover 'd with Water and Mud , that I could not tell at first , whether she had any Thing on or not . Q . Had she any Thing in her Mouth ? Smith . She had a piece of her Pocket Apron ty 'd about her Mouth , but I did not see any Thing in it . I took them out of the Ditch ; here 's a piece of the Cord they were ty 'd with . George Field . One Wednesday Morning about 5 o'Clock , a Man came to me for a Quartern of Gin , and said , there was a poor Woman had been thrown naked into a Ditch , and was almost starved , he would drink some of it himself , he said , and would give her the rest . I took the Gin in my Hand and went with him . Our Men that work in the Fields had put her into a Clamp , ( or Brick-Kiln ) but there was but little Heat in it . When I came up , the Men ask 'd me for a Dram ; No , no says I , the Woman wants it more than you , so I gave her a Glass , and look 'd at her , she had a good likely Face , but she was in a most miserable Condition . After I had seen her , I went to my Spouse and said , Bett , there 's a Woman bound in a miserable Manner , and must certainly dye ; if you think well , I 'll bring her here , and she shall be put to Bed ; she consented , so I brought her Home and she was put to Bed , and we kept her till Friday Evening . Q . Do you know what 's become of the Man that was bound with you ? Pate . I never saw him before ; when we were unbound , he ran away as fast as he could . Ann Booth . Mrs . Pate lodged in my House at that Time ; she went out , in order to go to Tottenham Court Fair , and did not come Home all Night ; in the Morning a Man came and told me she desired I would send her something to cover her Nakedness . Pate . My Lord the Prisoner has a great many Witnesses , I am afraid they are bad , let them come in one by one . - Barnes the Constable . I took the Prisoner in custody for an Assault , and a Woman telling him he was a Highwa man and a Thief , and that he had not walked to Highgate and Hampstead for nothing , I suspected him to be concerned in this Robbery , so I sent for her , and as soon as she came into the Room , she said , to her sorrow she knew that Man to be one that us 'd her ill with Morgan . I had shewn her several suspicious Persons ? before , but she never accus 'd any but Morgan and the Prisoner . Prisoner . A Woman that I had some Dispute with , swore an Assault against me , and I was carried to this Barnes 's House , so he sent for this Woman , whom I never saw in my Life , and the Design is , to take away my Life for the sake of the Reward . I beg you 'd dive into this Woman 's Character , and enquire how she gets her Living . Q . When you Swore against Morgan , did not you swear he Ravish 'd you . Pate . It was not asked me in that Manner ; I said , he did all that lay in his Way . Richard Carsew . The Prisoner came to my House at Sittingborn the 14th of August last , and liv 'd there a Fortnight ; Sittingborn is 43 Miles from London . He was at Harvest-work in the Island , before he came to my House . Q . What Time did he go away from your House ? Carsew . I ca n't tell . Q . Was you never here before - to give Evidence . Carsew . No ; if you want a Character of me , I can send to Sittingborn , there 's Justice Hole , and the Heads of the Place , will give me a Character . C. But we ca n't stay to send to Sittingborn ; do you know Mr. Pemberton there ? Carsew . No . C. Mr. Pemberton lives within a Quarter of a Mile of the Town , and is a Gentleman of 5 or 600 a Year . What 's the Man 's Name at the Rose-Inn ? Carsew . I ca n't remember . A Stranger . Do you know Mr. Adney ? Carsew . Aye ! that 's the Name .

I work 'd with the Prisoner the 14th or 15th of August at Mr. Tassel 's , a Farmer at Sittingborn , and we worked there a Fortnight We were eighteen of us work 'd in a Field together . William Low . The Prosecutrix 's Name I thought had been Hoskings , then she changed it to Pulwash , and now to Pate . She was lock 'd out the Night before she was robbed , and begged a Lodging at my House . She sent for me after she was robbed , and told me she could swear but to one Man , and he had a Scar in his Cheek . Afterwards she told me the Thief-takers and she had seen the Fellows that robbed her at Welch-Runt Fair , and that they knew how to find them . Some Time after this she told me the Thief-takers d - mn 'd her for a Bitch , and said she must swear to some body right or wrong , for they would not spend their Time after her A - se for nothing . Pate . They never said so ; I have consider 'd of the Thing , and have begg 'd of God they might die before they were taken . Low . Pate has lived about Black-Mary's-Hole , plying at the Bawdy Houses . I have heard her say , she 'd swear away a Person 's Life for a Farthing ; she said so to my Sister , and my Sister hit her a knock in the Face for it . Q . ( To Low ) Have you any body here that knows you ? Low . No ; I am a Turner in Castle-Yard , Holbourn . Pate . This Man ( Low ) keeps a vile House in Gray 's Inn-Lane , and the Woman he lives with , has another Husband . Charles Shippey . I am a Cooper in St. John-street ; I know Low , he lives in Gray's-Inn Lane ; I look upon him to be a Man whose Oath may be believed . Susan Low . I was married to Mr. Low at the Fleet . - The Night before she was robbed she told me , she had dream 'd that she was robb 'd , and gagg 'd , and thrown into a Ditch ; and when I saw her after the Robbery , I told her , her Dream was fatal . When I asked her , if she knew the Men , she said , - as she hoped to be sav 'd she could swear but to one . Another Time she told me , the Thief-takers seiz 'd her to fix upon some body . I never saw the Prisoner before , so I do n't come for Interest . Q . How did the Prisoner know you could say all this ? Low . I do n't know , but I was subpoena 'd here . Pate . This very Woman was try 'd here for picking Pockets . Marget Anderson . About a Week or a Fortnight before last Sessions , she said she had seen one of the Men in Tothill Fields Bridewell . On Saturday in the same Sessions , she said she saw the Man in King-street , St Giles 's , and she called me to look at a Man like a Chair man , - as there 's a Christ in Heaven , that 's the Man , says she ; and this was a Man nothing near so tall as the Prisoner , and she said his Name was O Bryan .
